QUESTION:
in \triangle X Y Z, P is the centroid, K P = 3, and X J = 8. Find Y J.

A. 3
B. 6
C. 8
D. 9

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have triangle XYZ, and point P is the centroid. We know that KP = 3 and XJ = 8. The question is asking for YJ. The answer choices are A. 3, B. 6, C. 8, D. 9.

First, I need to recall what a centroid is. The centroid of a triangle is the intersection point of the three medians. Each median connects a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. Also, the centroid divides each median into segments with a ratio of 2:1, where the longer part is closer to the vertex.

Now, looking at the given constraints:

- Length of line XJ is 8. So, XJ = 8. But wait, J isn't mentioned as a midpoint yet. Let me check the other points.

Other constraints:

- Point K lies on line ZY. So, K is somewhere on the line connecting Z and Y.

- Point P lies on line ZJ. Wait, so P is on line ZJ? But also, P is on line YL (from another constraint) and on line XK?

Wait, let me parse all the constraints again:

Given:

1. Equals(LengthOf(Line(X, J)), 8). So, XJ = 8.

2. PointLiesOnLine(K, Line(Z, Y)): K is on ZY.

3. PointLiesOnLine(P, Line(Z, J)): P is on ZJ.

4. PointLiesOnLine(J, Line(Y, X)): J is on line YX. Wait, so J is a point on line YX. That means J lies somewhere between Y and X, or extended beyond?

But since XJ is given as 8, maybe J is a specific point here. Maybe J is the midpoint of XY? Not sure yet.

Also:

5. PointLiesOnLine(P, Line(Y, L)): P is on YL.

Wait, but there's no mention of L in the original triangle XYZ. Hmm, perhaps L is another point? Or maybe it's a typo? Wait, maybe the problem has some other elements. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the diagram includes more points. Since we have lines like ZY, ZJ, YX, etc., perhaps J is connected to other points.

But let's focus on the main information. We need to find YJ, given that P is the centroid, KP=3, and XJ=8.

So, first, let me sketch mentally the triangle XYZ. Let me assume standard notation: vertices X, Y, Z. Then, the centroid P is inside the triangle. Now, the centroid divides each median into 2:1 ratio.

But how do the points K, J, L come into play?

Let me note down all the given points:

- J is on line YX (since PointLiesOnLine(J, Line(Y,X))). So J is a point along the line connecting Y and X. Therefore, J could be between Y and X or outside. Given that XJ = 8, which might mean that J is located such that when you go from X towards Y, you reach J after moving 8 units. But without knowing coordinates, it's hard to tell. However, since J is on line YX, then maybe J is the midpoint? Not necessarily unless specified.

Also, K is on line ZY. And P is on both ZJ and YL (but L isn't defined). Also, P is on line XK? Wait, the constraints say:

PointLiesOnLine(P, Line(X,K)). So P is on line XK. So, P is on line XK, and also on line ZJ. Therefore, P is the intersection of lines XK and ZJ. But since P is the centroid, which is the intersection of medians. Therefore, this suggests that line XK is a median? Or maybe not. Because the centroid is the intersection of medians, so if P is the centroid, then line XK must be a median. Wait, but for a median, it should connect a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. If line XK is a median, then K would be the midpoint of the opposite side. But K is on line ZY. So if line XK is a median, then K must be the midpoint of ZY. Therefore, K is the midpoint of ZY.

Similarly, since P is on ZJ, then line ZJ must be a median. So, line ZJ connects Z to J, which is on line YX. For ZJ to be a median, J must be the midpoint of YX. Wait, because a median connects a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. So if ZJ is a median, then J must be the midpoint of YX. Therefore, J is the midpoint of YX. Hence, YJ would be half of YX. Wait, but XJ is given as 8. If J is the midpoint of YX, then XJ equals YJ, so YJ would be 8. But that would make answer C. But wait, let me check this reasoning again.

But hold on, if J is the midpoint of YX, then YJ = XJ. Because J is the midpoint, so YJ = XJ. Therefore, if XJ = 8, then YJ = 8. But then why is KP given as 3? Maybe my assumption that ZJ is a median is incorrect?

Wait, but according to the constraints, P lies on ZJ and on XK. Since P is the centroid, which is the intersection of the medians. Therefore, if P is on ZJ, then ZJ must be a median. Which implies that J is the midpoint of the opposite side. The opposite side of Z is XY. Therefore, J must be the midpoint of XY. Therefore, YJ = XJ = 8. But then why is KP given as 3? There must be something wrong here.

Alternatively, maybe ZJ is not a median. Wait, but P is the centroid, so if P is on ZJ, then ZJ must be a median. Otherwise, the centroid wouldn't lie on it. Therefore, J must be the midpoint of XY. Thus, YJ = XJ = 8. So answer C. But then why is KP given as 3? Maybe that's a red herring? Or maybe there's more to the problem.

Wait, but maybe J is not the midpoint. Let me re-examine the constraints. The problem says:

PointLiesOnLine(J, Line(Y, X)) â€” meaning J is on line YX. It does not specify that J is the midpoint. So even though P is on ZJ, which is supposed to be a median, but maybe ZJ is not a median. Wait, but how can that be? If P is the centroid, then it must lie on all three medians. Therefore, if P is on ZJ, then ZJ must be a median. Therefore, J must be the midpoint of XY. Therefore, YJ = XJ = 8. So answer C. But then why give KP = 3? Is there something else?

Wait, maybe there's confusion about which sides are being considered. Let me think again. The centroid divides each median into 2:1 ratio. So if ZJ is a median, then J is the midpoint of XY. Then, the length from Z to J is the entire median, and the centroid divides it into two parts: from Z to P is twice as long as from P to J. But we don't know the total length of ZJ. However, we have another piece of info: KP = 3. Where is K?

K is on line ZY. Also, P lies on line XK. So, line XK goes from X to K, which is on ZY. So, line XK is another median? Wait, if line XK is a median, then K must be the midpoint of ZY. Therefore, K is the midpoint of ZY. Therefore, line XK is the median from X to midpoint of ZY. Therefore, P, being the centroid, lies on this median. Also, since P is on ZJ (which is the median from Z to midpoint of XY), then P is the intersection of these two medians.

Therefore, in this case, since we have two medians intersecting at P, which is the centroid. Now, KP is given as 3. Let me visualize this.

Let me denote the midpoints. Suppose J is the midpoint of XY, and K is the midpoint of ZY. Then, the medians are XJ (connecting X to J) and ZK (connecting Z to K). Wait, but earlier we had that P is on ZJ. Wait, but if J is the midpoint of XY, then ZJ is a line from Z to J. But if J is the midpoint of XY, then ZJ is not a median; rather, the median from Z would go to the midpoint of XY, which is J. Therefore, ZJ is indeed a median. Similarly, the median from X goes to K, the midpoint of ZY. Therefore, line XK is the median from X to midpoint of ZY (point K).

Therefore, P is the centroid lying on both medians XJ and ZK. Wait, but in our problem statement, P is on ZJ (median from Z to J) and also on XK (median from X to K). So yes, those two medians meet at P. Therefore, the centroid divides each median into 2:1 ratio.

So, for example, along median ZJ, the centroid P divides it into ZP : PJ = 2:1. Similarly, along median XK, the centroid divides it into XP : PK = 2:1. Wait, but we are given KP = 3. So, if PK is part of the median XK, then PK corresponds to the segment from P to K. Since the centroid divides the median into 2:1, then PK is one-third of the median XK. Therefore, if PK = 3, then the entire median XK is 3 * 3 = 9? Wait, no. Wait, the centroid divides the median into 2:1, so the portion from the vertex to centroid is twice the portion from centroid to midpoint. So for median XK, starting at X, going through P to K (midpoint). So XP : PK = 2:1. Therefore, PK is one-third of the entire median. So if PK = 3, then the entire median XK is 3*3 = 9. Therefore, the length of median XK is 9.

But how does this help us find YJ?

Well, we were told that XJ = 8. Earlier, we thought that J is the midpoint of XY, making XJ equal to YJ. But if that's the case, then XJ = YJ = 8, so answer C. But why is KP given as 3? Because that relates to the median from X to K (the midpoint of ZY), but how does that relate to YJ?

Wait, maybe there's a miscalculation here. Let me re-express this.

If J is the midpoint of XY, then XJ = YJ. Given XJ = 8, so YJ = 8. So answer C. But why is KP given? Maybe that's just extra info to test if we're paying attention? Or maybe there's a mistake in assuming that J is the midpoint. Let me check again.

The key is whether ZJ is a median. Since P is on ZJ and is the centroid, then ZJ must be a median. Therefore, J is the midpoint of the opposite side. The opposite side of Z is XY. Therefore, J is the midpoint of XY. Therefore, XJ = YJ. Hence, YJ = 8. But then why is KP = 3 given? Perhaps there's a different configuration.

Wait, maybe the problem isn't using standard notation. Let me check again the constraints:

We have:

- PointLiesOnLine(K, Line(Z,Y)): K is on ZY.

- PointLiesOnLine(P, Line(Z,J)): P is on ZJ.

- PointLiesOnLine(P, Line(X,K)): P is on XK.

Therefore, P is the intersection of lines ZJ and XK. But since P is the centroid, it must lie on all three medians. Therefore, lines ZJ and XK must be two of the medians. Therefore, ZJ is a median (so J is midpoint of XY), and XK is a median (so K is midpoint of ZY). 

Thus, J is midpoint of XY => XJ = YJ = 8. Therefore, answer C. But then KP = 3 is given. How does that fit in?

If K is the midpoint of ZY, then the median from X to K. The centroid divides this median into XP : PK = 2:1. So if PK = 3, then the entire median XK is 3 + 2*3 = 9. So the length of the median from X to K is 9. But how does that affect YJ?

It seems unrelated. Unless there's a relation between the medians. However, without additional information about the sides or other lengths, maybe the answer is still 8. But then why include KP=3? Maybe the problem is designed to trick us into thinking that YJ depends on KP, but actually, it's independent. 

Alternatively, maybe my assumption that J is the midpoint is wrong. Let me consider another possibility. What if J is not the midpoint of XY, but some other point on line YX? Then, ZJ would not be a median, but since P lies on ZJ and is the centroid, that would imply that ZJ is a median. Therefore, J must be the midpoint. So regardless of other factors, J is the midpoint. Hence, YJ = XJ = 8. So answer C.

But maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Let me think differently. Suppose that J is not the midpoint. Then, ZJ is not a median, but since P is the centroid, which lies on ZJ, then maybe ZJ is a different line? Wait, no. The centroid lies on all three medians. Therefore, if P is on ZJ, then ZJ must be a median. Therefore, J must be the midpoint of the opposite side. So this brings us back to J being the midpoint of XY. Hence, YJ = XJ = 8. Therefore, answer C. 

However, the presence of KP = 3 suggests that maybe there's more to it. Let me think if there's another approach. Suppose that instead of J being the midpoint, there's some other relationship. For example, maybe J is a point on YX such that ZJ passes through centroid P. In that case, J is not necessarily the midpoint. But how can that happen?

For instance, suppose that ZJ is not a median but still passes through the centroid. But the centroid lies on all medians, so if ZJ is not a median, then it cannot pass through the centroid unless it coincides with a median. Wait, but if ZJ is not a median, then the centroid shouldn't be on it. Therefore, this contradiction implies that ZJ must be a median. Therefore, J must be the midpoint. Hence, YJ = XJ = 8. 

Therefore, the answer should be C. But why is KP given? Maybe the problem is trying to mislead us. Alternatively, perhaps there's a calculation involving KP and the medians. Let me try to calculate the length of the median from X to K, which is 9 (as per earlier logic, since PK=3 and it's 1/3 of the median). But how does that relate to YJ?

Unless there's a formula connecting medians. For example, in a triangle, the medians are related to the sides via Apollonius theorem. But without knowing other sides or medians, I don't see how that helps. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves vectors or coordinate geometry. Let me attempt coordinate geometry.

Let me assign coordinates to the triangle. Let me place point X at (0, 0), Y at (a, 0), and Z at (b, c). Then, the centroid P has coordinates ((a + b)/3, (0 + c)/3). Wait, no. The centroid coordinates are average of the vertices' coordinates. So if X is (x1,y1), Y(x2,y2), Z(x3,y3), then centroid P is ((x1+x2+x3)/3, (y1+y2+y3)/3).

But given that, let me define coordinates accordingly. But since J is on line YX, which is the x-axis in this setup. Let me assume that line YX is horizontal. So X is at (0,0), Y is at (d, 0), and J is some point on YX. Let me denote J as (j, 0), since it's on line YX. Given that XJ = 8. Since X is at (0,0), then distance from X(0,0) to J(j,0) is |j - 0| = |j|. So XJ = |j| = 8. So j = Â±8. Assuming the direction from X to Y, maybe J is between X and Y or beyond. Let's assume it's between X and Y, so J is at (8, 0) if X is at (0,0) and Y is further along the positive x-axis. But if J is beyond Y, then it would be negative. But since the problem mentions YJ, which would be the distance from Y to J. Let me proceed.

Assume J is at (8, 0). Then, since J is on line YX, which in this coordinate system is the x-axis from X(0,0) to Y(d, 0). So if J is at (8,0), then depending on where Y is. For example, if Y is at (d, 0), then if d > 8, J is between X and Y. If d < 8, J is beyond Y. But since we don't know d, it's ambiguous. However, since P is the centroid, and lies on ZJ and XK.

Additionally, K is on line ZY. Let me assume coordinates for Z. Let me set up coordinates step by step.

Let me fix X at (0,0), Y at (y, 0), Z at (z_x, z_y). Then, J is on line YX, so J has coordinates (j, 0), with XJ = 8. So distance from X(0,0) to J(j,0) is |j| = 8 â†’ j = 8 or -8. Assume j = 8, so J is at (8, 0). Now, since J is on line YX, which extends from X(0,0) to Y(y, 0). So if y > 8, J is between X and Y. If y < 8, J is beyond Y. Let me assume that y > 8, so J is between X and Y. Then, YJ would be |y - 8|.

Now, the line ZJ connects Z(z_x, z_y) to J(8, 0). The centroid P lies on this line. Also, P lies on line XK, where K is on line ZY.

Let me find equations for these lines.

First, line ZJ: passing through Z(z_x, z_y) and J(8, 0). Parametric equations for ZJ can be written as:

x = z_x + t*(8 - z_x)

y = z_y + t*(0 - z_y) = z_y*(1 - t)

for parameter t âˆˆ [0,1].

Centroid P lies on this line. Also, P lies on line XK, where K is on ZY. Let me find coordinates for K.

Line ZY connects Z(z_x, z_y) to Y(y, 0). Let me parametrize K as a point on ZY. Let me use parameter s âˆˆ [0,1]:

x = z_x + s*(y - z_x)

y = z_y + s*(0 - z_y) = z_y*(1 - s)

So K is (z_x + s(y - z_x), z_y*(1 - s)).

Then, line XK connects X(0,0) to K. Its parametric equation is:

x = k_x * t

y = k_y * t

where K has coordinates (k_x, k_y) = (z_x + s(y - z_x), z_y*(1 - s)).

So parametric form of line XK is:

x = [z_x + s(y - z_x)] * u

y = [z_y*(1 - s)] * u

for parameter u âˆˆ [0,1].

Since P lies on both ZJ and XK, we can find coordinates of P by solving these equations.

But this seems complicated. Instead, since P is the centroid, its coordinates are ((X_x + Y_x + Z_x)/3, (X_y + Y_y + Z_y)/3). Here, X is (0,0), Y is (y, 0), Z is (z_x, z_y). So centroid P has coordinates:

P_x = (0 + y + z_x)/3

P_y = (0 + 0 + z_y)/3 = z_y / 3

Now, since P lies on line ZJ. Let me write the equation of line ZJ. Points Z(z_x, z_y) and J(8, 0). The slope of ZJ is (0 - z_y)/(8 - z_x) = -z_y/(8 - z_x). Equation of line ZJ can be written as:

(y - z_y) = [-z_y/(8 - z_x)](x - z_x)

Since P lies on this line, substituting P_x and P_y:

P_y - z_y = [-z_y/(8 - z_x)](P_x - z_x)

Substitute P_x = (y + z_x)/3 and P_y = z_y / 3:

Left-hand side: (z_y / 3) - z_y = -2z_y / 3

Right-hand side: [-z_y / (8 - z_x)] * [(y + z_x)/3 - z_x] = [-z_y / (8 - z_x)] * [ (y + z_x - 3z_x)/3 ] = [-z_y / (8 - z_x)] * [ (y - 2z_x)/3 ]

So equating left and right:

-2z_y / 3 = [-z_y / (8 - z_x)] * [ (y - 2z_x)/3 ]

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate denominators:

-2z_y = [-z_y / (8 - z_x)] * (y - 2z_x)

Assuming z_y â‰  0 (otherwise, the triangle would be degenerate):

Divide both sides by -z_y:

2 = [1 / (8 - z_x)] * (y - 2z_x)

Multiply both sides by (8 - z_x):

2(8 - z_x) = y - 2z_x

Expand left side:

16 - 2z_x = y - 2z_x

Add 2z_x to both sides:

16 = y

Therefore, y = 16.

So this tells us that the coordinate of Y is (16, 0). Therefore, the length YJ is the distance from Y(16, 0) to J(8, 0), which is |16 - 8| = 8. Hence, YJ = 8. This matches option C.

But wait, this was under the assumption that J is at (8, 0), which came from XJ = 8. So this confirms that YJ = 8. So answer C.

But then why is KP = 3 given? In this scenario, how does that factor in? Let me check.

We also have that P lies on line XK, where K is on ZY. Let me compute coordinates of K and P to verify KP = 3.

From above, we found that y = 16. So Y is at (16, 0). Let me find coordinates of K. Recall that K is on ZY, which goes from Z(z_x, z_y) to Y(16, 0). Let me express K as a point on ZY. Let me parametrize it with parameter s:

K_x = z_x + s(16 - z_x)

K_y = z_y + s(0 - z_y) = z_y(1 - s)

Then, line XK connects X(0,0) to K(K_x, K_y). The parametric equations for line XK are:

x = K_x * t

y = K_y * t

for t âˆˆ [0,1].

Since P lies on this line, its coordinates must satisfy:

P_x = K_x * t

P_y = K_y * t

But we already have expressions for P_x and P_y:

P_x = (0 + 16 + z_x)/3 = (16 + z_x)/3

P_y = z_y / 3

Therefore,

(16 + z_x)/3 = K_x * t

and

z_y / 3 = K_y * t

From the second equation:

t = (z_y / 3) / K_y = (z_y / 3) / [z_y(1 - s)] ) = 1/[3(1 - s)]

Therefore, t = 1/[3(1 - s)]

Substituting into first equation:

(16 + z_x)/3 = K_x * [1/(3(1 - s))] â‡’ (16 + z_x)/3 = [z_x + s(16 - z_x)] * [1/(3(1 - s))]

Multiply both sides by 3:

16 + z_x = [z_x + s(16 - z_x)] / (1 - s)

Multiply both sides by (1 - s):

(16 + z_x)(1 - s) = z_x + s(16 - z_x)

Expand left side:

16(1 - s) + z_x(1 - s) = 16 - 16s + z_x - z_x s

Right side: z_x + 16s - z_x s

Set equal:

16 - 16s + z_x - z_x s = z_x + 16s - z_x s

Cancel terms:

16 - 16s = 16s

Bring terms together:

16 = 32s â†’ s = 16 / 32 = 1/2

So s = 1/2. Therefore, K is the midpoint of ZY, since s = 1/2. Therefore, K is midpoint of ZY. Hence, coordinates of K are:

K_x = z_x + (1/2)(16 - z_x) = (z_x + 16)/2

K_y = z_y(1 - 1/2) = z_y / 2

So K is midpoint of ZY. Therefore, line XK is the median from X to midpoint of ZY, which makes sense. Now, the centroid P lies on this median, dividing it into 2:1 ratio. So the length from X to P is twice the length from P to K.

Given that KP = 3, which is the length from P to K. Let me calculate the length of XK, which is the median from X to K.

Coordinates of X are (0,0), and K is ((z_x + 16)/2, z_y / 2). So length of XK is sqrt[ ((z_x + 16)/2 - 0)^2 + (z_y / 2 - 0)^2 ] = (1/2)sqrt[(z_x + 16)^2 + z_y^2]. 

But since P divides XK in ratio 2:1, then PK = (1/3)*length of XK. Therefore:

PK = (1/3)*(1/2)sqrt[(z_x + 16)^2 + z_y^2] ? No, wait. Wait, the entire length of XK is divided by P into XP:PK = 2:1. So PK = (1/3) of the length of XK. Therefore, if PK = 3, then length of XK = 9. Therefore:

(1/3)*length of XK = 3 â‡’ length of XK = 9. Hence,

(1/2)sqrt[(z_x + 16)^2 + z_y^2] = 9 ?

Wait, no. Wait, the length of XK is sqrt[ ((z_x + 16)/2)^2 + (z_y/2)^2 ] = (1/2)sqrt[(z_x + 16)^2 + z_y^2]. Therefore, setting this equal to 9:

(1/2)sqrt[(z_x + 16)^2 + z_y^2] = 9 â‡’ sqrt[(z_x + 16)^2 + z_y^2] = 18 â‡’ (z_x + 16)^2 + z_y^2 = 324.

But we don't know z_x and z_y. However, this equation must hold. But how does this relate to finding YJ? Well, YJ is already determined as 8 from earlier steps, regardless of the values of z_x and z_y. Hence, even though KP = 3 gives us this condition, it doesn't affect the value of YJ. Therefore, YJ remains 8.

Hence, the correct answer is C. 8.

But let me confirm once more. All steps led us to YJ = 8, and KP = 3 is consistent with the median length. So despite the presence of KP = 3, it doesn't change the conclusion. Hence, answer C.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ YJ $ in triangle $ XYZ $, we begin by analyzing the geometric constraints and leveraging the definition of the **centroid**.

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Centroid**
In any triangle, the **centroid** is the point of intersection of the three **medians**, and it always divides each median into a **2:1 ratio**, with the larger segment being closer to the vertex.

Given:
- $ P $ is the centroid.
- $ P $ lies on lines $ ZJ $ and $ XK $, which strongly indicates that **$ ZJ $ and $ XK $ are medians**.
- Therefore, **line $ ZJ $ is a median**, implying that **point $ J $ is the midpoint of side $ XY $**.

---

### **Step 2: Interpreting the Constraint $ XJ = 8 $**

Since $ J $ is the **midpoint** of segment $ XY $, it follows that:
$$
XJ = YJ
$$
This is due to the symmetry of the midpoint: the distances from $ J $ to both endpoints of the segment are equal.

Given that $ XJ = 8 $, it directly follows that:
$$
YJ = 8
$$

---

### **Step 3: Addressing the Additional Information ($ KP = 3 $)**

While $ KP = 3 $ appears to add complexity, it pertains to the **median from $ X $ to midpoint $ K $ of $ ZY $**. The fact that $ P $ lies on this median confirms that $ P $ is the centroid and splits the median in a **2:1 ratio**.

That is, if $ PK = 3 $, then:
$$
XP : PK = 2 : 1 \Rightarrow XP = 6,\quad PK = 3
$$
This confirms consistency with the centroid property but **does not alter the value of $ YJ $**.

---

### **Conclusion**

All geometric relationships and constraints consistently lead to the conclusion that **$ YJ = 8 $** based on the definition of the centroid and the role of $ J $ as the midpoint of $ XY $.

$$
\text{Final Answer: } \boxed{\text{C}}
$$
