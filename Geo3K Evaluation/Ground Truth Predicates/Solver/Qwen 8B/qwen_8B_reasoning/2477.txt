MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, C, and D. The given information includes that angle ADC measures 122 degrees. Also, points A, B, and C lie on a circle centered at D with radius 1.0. Wait, so point D is the center of the circle? Because they mention Circle(D, radius_1_0), which would mean D is the center. Therefore, DA, DB, DC are all radii of the circle, right? Since A, B, and C are on the circle centered at D, their distances from D are equal to the radius, which is 1.0 units. 

So, triangle DAC is formed by points D, A, and C. Since DA and DC are both radii, triangle DAC is an isosceles triangle with DA = DC. The measure of angle ADC is given as 122 degrees. In an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal. Wait, but here angle at D is 122 degrees, so the two base angles would be at A and C. Let me check that again. In triangle DAC, sides DA and DC are equal, so the base angles opposite them would be angles at C and A. Wait, no—wait, in triangle DAC, the vertex angle is at D, between sides DA and DC. Then the base angles are at A and C. So those two angles should be equal. 

Let me calculate those angles. The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So angle at D is 122°, so the remaining 180 - 122 = 58 degrees are split equally between angles at A and C. So each base angle is 58/2 = 29 degrees. Therefore, angles at A and C in triangle DAC are 29 degrees each. 

But wait, how does this relate to angle B? The question asks for the measure of angle B. But where is point B located? The problem states that point B also lies on the same circle centered at D. So points A, B, and C are all on the circumference of the circle with center D. So, maybe there's some cyclic quadrilateral involved? Or perhaps triangle DBC or something else?

Wait, but the problem mentions angle B. Hmm. So angle B could refer to angle ABC or angle at point B in some triangle. However, since only points A, B, C, and D are mentioned, maybe it's referring to angle at point B in triangle BDC or something similar?

Alternatively, perhaps considering the circle centered at D, points A, B, C are on the circle. If we consider arcs. For example, angle subtended by an arc at the center versus at the circumference. But since D is the center, then angles at D are central angles, while angles at the circumference (like at A, B, C) would be inscribed angles. 

Wait, but angle ADC is a central angle because D is the center. So the measure of angle ADC is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc AC. Since angle ADC is 122°, that means arc AC is 122°. 

Now, if we can find the measure of another angle related to arc BC or AB, maybe we can find angle B. However, I need more information about where point B is located. The problem doesn't specify the position of B relative to A and C. Are A, B, C placed in order around the circle? Or is there some specific configuration?

Wait, maybe the key is that points A, B, C are all on the circle centered at D, so DA=DB=DC=radius. So triangles DAB, DBC, etc., are all isosceles. But without knowing the positions of B relative to A and C, it's hard to tell. However, the problem might assume that points A, B, C are arranged such that angle B refers to an inscribed angle over some arc.

Wait, but angle B could be part of triangle ABC or triangle DBC. Alternatively, since all points are on the circle with center D, perhaps angle B is an inscribed angle. For example, if angle B is formed by chords BA and BC, then the measure of angle B would be half the measure of the arc AC. Wait, but arc AC was already 122°, so angle B would be half of that, which is 61°. But that's assuming that angle B is an inscribed angle intercepting arc AC. 

But why would angle B intercept arc AC? That depends on the position of B. Suppose points A, B, C are arranged on the circle in order, so that moving from A to B to C along the circumference. Then angle ABC would be an inscribed angle intercepting arc AC. But if that's the case, then yes, angle ABC would be half the measure of arc AC. Since arc AC is 122°, angle ABC would be 61°, which is option C. 

But wait, let me verify that. In a circle, the inscribed angle theorem says that an angle formed by three points on the circle (with the vertex at one point) is half the measure of the intercepted arc. So if angle ABC intercepts arc AC, then angle ABC is ½ * arc AC. 

However, for angle ABC to intercept arc AC, point B has to be positioned such that when you connect BA and BC, the arc between A and C that doesn't contain B is intercepted. But depending on where B is, the intercepted arc could be major or minor. 

But given that the central angle for arc AC is 122°, which is less than 180°, meaning that arc AC is less than a semicircle. Therefore, the inscribed angle intercepting arc AC would be half of 122°, which is 61°, so angle ABC would be 61°, making the answer C. 

Alternatively, if angle B were intercepting the rest of the circle, like the major arc AC, then it would be half of (360 - 122) = 238°, leading to 119°, which isn't among the choices. So likely, angle B is intercepting the minor arc AC, giving 61°, which is option C. 

Another way to think: since points A, B, C are on the circle centered at D. Suppose we look at triangle ABC. But since D is the center, connecting BD would be another radius. Maybe triangle ABD or CBD. Wait, but unless we know more about the positions, it's hard to say. However, the fact that angle ADC is given, and points A, B, C are on the circle. Perhaps angle B refers to angle ABD or CBD? 

Alternatively, if we consider triangle DBC. Since DB is a radius, DC is a radius, so triangle DBC is isosceles with legs DB and DC. Wait, but angle at D would be... Well, angle ADC is given as 122°, which is angle between DA and DC. If point B is somewhere else on the circle, then angle BDC would depend on where B is. But without knowing where B is, this seems ambiguous. 

Wait, but maybe there's a different approach. Since all points A, B, C are on the circle centered at D, then lines DA, DB, DC are all radii. So, for instance, if we consider angles involving point B. For example, suppose we consider triangle DBC. If we can find the measure of angle at B in triangle DBC, but that requires knowing the measure of other angles. However, without knowing the exact placement of B, this is tricky. 

Wait, but maybe the problem assumes that points A, B, C are consecutive points on the circle. For example, A, B, C are placed such that moving around the circle, you go from A to B to C. Then, angle at B (angle ABC) would intercept arc AC, which is 122°, hence angle ABC would be 61°, which matches option C. 

Alternatively, if angle B refers to angle ABD or something else. But given that the answer choices include 61°, which is half of 122°, that seems plausible. 

Therefore, based on the inscribed angle theorem, angle B intercepting arc AC (which is 122°) gives 61°, which is option C. Hence, the answer is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $ \angle B $, we begin by analyzing the given geometric setup:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Configuration**

We are told:
- Points $ A $, $ B $, and $ C $ lie on a circle centered at point $ D $ with radius $ r = 1.0 $. 
- This implies that segments $ DA $, $ DB $, and $ DC $ are all radii of the same circle, i.e., $ DA = DB = DC $.
- Angle $ \angle ADC = 122^\circ $, which is a central angle in this circle.

---

### **Step 2: Use Central Angle and Inscribed Angle Theorem**

Since $ \angle ADC $ is a central angle, it corresponds to the arc $ \overset{\frown}{AC} $ that it intercepts. By definition of central angles:

$$
\text{Measure of } \angle ADC = \text{Measure of arc } \overset{\frown}{AC}
$$

Thus,

$$
\overset{\frown}{AC} = 122^\circ
$$

Now, if point $ B $ lies on the same circle, and we're asked for $ \angle B $, it is most natural to interpret this as the **inscribed angle** subtending the same arc $ \overset{\frown}{AC} $.

By the **Inscribed Angle Theorem**, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends. So:

$$
m\angle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times \overset{\frown}{AC} = \frac{1}{2} \times 122^\circ = 61^\circ
$$

This applies if point $ B $ lies on the circumference of the circle such that $ \angle ABC $ intercepts arc $ \overset{\frown}{AC} $. This is consistent with standard geometric interpretations.

---

### **Conclusion**

The measure of $ \angle B $, interpreted as the inscribed angle subtending arc $ \overset{\frown}{AC} $, is:

$$
\boxed{61^\circ}
$$
