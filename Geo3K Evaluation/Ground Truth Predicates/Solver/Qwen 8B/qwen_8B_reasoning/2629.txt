QUESTION:
In the figure, m \angle 9 = 75. Find the measure of \angle 6.

CHOICES:
A. 75
B. 85
C. 95
D. 105

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to visualize the figure based on the given constraints. Since there are multiple points and angles mentioned, it might help to sketch a rough diagram mentally. Let me start by listing out all the information provided.

The problem states that m∠9 = 75°, and we need to find the measure of ∠6. The key here is to use the given angle equalities and parallel lines to find relationships between different angles.

First, let's note down all the given equalities:

1. ∠(L,B,D) = angle 1
2. ∠(D,B,F) = angle 2
3. ∠(B,F,M) = angle 5
4. ∠(G,B,L) = angle 4
5. ∠(M,F,T) = angle 6 (this is what we need)
6. ∠(J,B,G) = angle 3
7. ∠(B,J,E) = angle 9 (given as 75°)
8. ∠(E,J,T) = angle 10
9. ∠(I,F,B) = angle 8
10. ∠(J,F,I) = angle 7
11. ∠(T,J,C) = angle 11
12. ∠(L,J,C) = angle 12

Then there are several point-on-line conditions:

- Point J lies on line FT
- Point B lies on line FL
- Point F lies on line IM
- Point F lies on line BT
- Point J lies on line BT
- Point F lies on line BJ
- Point B lies on line DG
- Point B lies on line TL
- Point F lies on line TL
- Point J lies on line TL
- Point B lies on line JL
- Point F lies on line JL
- Point J lies on line CE
- Lines DG and MI are parallel
- Lines DG and EC are parallel

This seems complex, but maybe some of these can form transversals with parallel lines, leading to corresponding or alternate interior angles.

Let me try to identify which lines are parallel. It says DG || MI and DG || EC. Therefore, since DG is parallel to both MI and EC, then MI and EC are also parallel? Wait, no—if DG is parallel to MI and DG is parallel to EC, then MI must be parallel to EC because they're both parallel to the same line. So MI || EC.

Also, since DG || EC, and B lies on DG (from the point-on-line condition: Point B lies on line DG). Also, point J lies on line CE (from the last point-on-line condition: Point J lies on line CE).

So perhaps triangle or something involving those lines?

Now, looking at the angles given. Let's see. We have ∠(B,J,E) = angle 9 = 75°, so that's angle at point J between points B and E. Since J is on CE (as per point-on-line), then EJ is part of CE. Also, B is on DG, which is parallel to EC. Maybe there's a transversal here?

Alternatively, since DG || EC, and if there's a transversal cutting them, then corresponding angles would be equal. But how does that connect to the rest?

Also, considering the points: Let me try to map out the positions. Points involved include B, F, L, D, G, M, I, J, T, E, C.

Since B is on DG and also on TL (point B lies on line TL). Also, F is on line BT (so F is somewhere along BT), and F is also on line IM and on line JL. Also, J is on line BT (since point J lies on line BT) and on line CE. Also, J is on line TL (from earlier). Hmm.

Wait, since J is on line BT and on line CE, so lines BT and CE intersect at J? Because J is their intersection.

Similarly, since DG || EC, and B is on DG, so line DG is parallel to EC, and B is a point on DG. If we consider line BE, since E is on CE, then BE connects B to E. Since DG || EC, then maybe BE is a transversal?

But I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach step by step.

Starting with angle 9, which is ∠(B,J,E) = 75°. This angle is at point J, between points B and E. Since J is on CE (as per the point-on-line condition), then JE is part of CE. So, point E is on line CE, and J is between C and E? Or could be extended?

Assuming standard notation, angle at J between B and E would mean that JB and JE are the two sides of the angle. So, JB and JE meet at J, forming angle 9.

Given that, and knowing that DG is parallel to EC, and B is on DG, perhaps there's a way to relate angles involving JB and EC.

Additionally, since DG || EC, and if there's a transversal cutting through them, say line JB, then maybe some corresponding angles?

Wait, DG || EC, and line JB intersects them. Let me think: If DG || EC, then the angle formed by a transversal with DG and EC would have corresponding angles equal. However, JB connects point J (on CE) to point B (on DG). So, JB is a transversal crossing DG and EC. Therefore, the angle between JB and DG at point B should correspond to the angle between JB and EC at point J.

But angle at B between DG and JB would be... Well, the line DG passes through B, so the direction of DG is known. Let me try to formalize this.

At point B, since it's on DG, the line DG goes through B. Then, JB connects B to J on CE. So, the angle between DG and JB at point B is equal to the angle between EC and JB at point J (because DG || EC, and JB is a transversal). That would make those angles equal.

Therefore, the angle between DG and JB at B equals the angle between EC and JB at J. Which would be angle ∠(B,J,E)? Wait, ∠(B,J,E) is at J between B and E. So, that angle would be equal to the angle between JB and EC at J. Which would correspond to the angle between JB and DG at B. Therefore, ∠(B,J,E) = angle between JB and DG at B.

But ∠(B,J,E) is given as 75°, so that means the angle between JB and DG at B is also 75°. Let me denote that as angle at B between JB and DG.

But DG is a straight line passing through B, so the angle between JB and DG at B would be adjacent to another angle along DG. For example, if we look at point B, and line DG going through it, then JB forms some angle with DG. Depending on the orientation, that angle could be supplementary to another angle.

Alternatively, maybe we can consider triangle JBE or something else. But perhaps I need to look for more relations.

Looking back at other angles. For instance, angle 3 is ∠(J,B,G) which is at point B between J and G. Since B is on DG (line DG), and G is a point on DG (assuming that line DG has points D, G, etc.). Wait, DG is a line, so points D and G are on it, and B is on DG. So, BG is part of line DG. Thus, ∠(J,B,G) is the angle at B between J and G, meaning that line BG is part of DG, and line BJ is another side. So, angle between BG (which is along DG) and BJ at point B.

Earlier, we had that this angle (∠(J,B,G)) is equal to angle 3. And from the previous reasoning, since DG || EC, the angle between JB and DG (at B) is equal to the angle between JB and EC at J, which was 75°. Therefore, angle between JB and DG at B is 75°, which is ∠(J,B,G) = angle 3. Hence, angle 3 = 75°.

So, angle 3 = 75°. Now, moving on.

Next, angle 7 is ∠(J,F,I). Let me check the constraints related to F. F is on line BT, line IM, line JL, line BJ, and line TL. Also, J is on line BT, so F is on line BT. Also, F is on line IM, which is parallel to DG (since DG || MI). Also, since DG || EC, and MI is parallel to DG, so MI || EC.

Moreover, F is on line JL. Since J is on CE, and line JL connects J to L. Also, B is on line JL (from point-on-line condition: Point B lies on line JL). So, line JL connects J to L, passing through B. Wait, because B lies on line JL. So, points J, B, L are colinear. Therefore, line JL includes points J, B, L. Also, F is on line JL (from point-on-line condition: Point F lies on line JL). Therefore, F is somewhere on line JL.

So, F is on line JL, which includes points J, B, L. Also, F is on line BT and line IM. Let me try to imagine that.

Since F is on line JL (through J, B, L), and also on line BT (so F is on BT). Therefore, F is the intersection of lines JL and BT. So, point F is the intersection of JL and BT. Given that, and since F is also on line IM (parallel to DG and EC), which may help us later.

Now, considering angle 7: ∠(J,F,I) is the angle at F between J and I. Since F is on line IM (from point-on-line condition: Point F lies on line IM), so FI is part of line IM. Therefore, angle at F between J and I would involve line FJ and FI. Since FI is along IM, and FJ is connecting F to J.

So, ∠(J,F,I) is the angle between FJ and FI at point F. Since FI is along line IM, which is parallel to DG and EC. Also, FJ connects F to J, which is on line BT. 

Hmm. Not sure yet. Maybe using parallel lines again. Since MI || DG, and if there is a transversal, like line FJ, which connects F to J. But I don't know the exact relationship here yet.

Let me see if I can find any triangles or other angle relationships. Also, remember that angle 9 is 75°, and we found angle 3 is 75°, so maybe there are similar angles elsewhere.

Another thing to note: since DG || EC, and B is on DG, while J is on EC. So, lines DG and EC are parallel, with B on DG and J on EC. Also, line BJ connects them. As before, the angle between DG and BJ at B equals the angle between EC and BJ at J, which was angle 9 = 75°, hence angle 3 = 75°.

Now, let's look at angle 5: ∠(B,F,M) = angle 5. Since F is on line IM, and M is a point on line IM. So, line FM is part of line IM. Therefore, ∠(B,F,M) is the angle at F between B and M. So, BF and FM form angle 5. Since F is on line IM, FM is along IM. So, angle at F between BF and FM. 

If I can find the measure of this angle, that would be angle 5. But how?

Well, since MI is parallel to DG, and if there is a transversal through F, which is connected to B. Let me think about that. Suppose line BF is a transversal cutting through MI (which is parallel to DG) and possibly other lines.

Alternatively, since F is on line IM, and line IM is parallel to DG. Also, point B is on DG. So, line BF connects point B (on DG) to F (on IM). Since DG || IM, then BF is a transversal. Therefore, the angle between BF and DG at B corresponds to the angle between BF and IM at F. 

Thus, ∠(B,F,M) is the angle at F between BF and FM (which is along IM). Therefore, that angle is equal to the angle between BF and DG at B. 

But what is that angle at B? At point B, the line DG is present. The angle between DG and BF at B would depend on other angles around B. 

But let me recall that angle at B between DG and JB is 75°, which we found earlier (angle 3). Also, since B is on line JL (points J, B, L), and F is on line JL. So, points J, B, F, L are colinear? No, wait, F is on line JL (from point-on-line condition: Point F lies on line JL), so F is on line JL. But line JL contains points J, B, L. So, F is somewhere on line JL. Therefore, BF is part of line JL. Wait, but F is on line JL, so BF is a segment from B to F on line JL. Therefore, the line BF is along line JL. Wait, but earlier we said that F is on line IM and line JL. So, line IM passes through F, and line JL passes through F. So, lines IM and JL intersect at F. 

So, since line IM is parallel to DG, and line JL passes through F (and B), then maybe there's a way to relate angles here. 

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I need to focus on specific angles. Let's go back to angle 5: ∠(B,F,M) = angle 5. Since FM is along IM, which is parallel to DG. And BF is along line JL (since F is on JL and B is on JL). So, BF is part of line JL. Therefore, angle between BF (along JL) and FM (along IM) at point F is angle 5. 

Because of the parallel lines DG || IM, and line JL (containing BF) acting as a transversal, the angle between BF (JL) and IM at F would be equal to the angle between DG and JL at B. 

Wait, since DG || IM, and line JL crosses both DG at B and IM at F. So, the angle between DG and JL at B is equal to the angle between IM and JL at F. Therefore, ∠(B,F,M) is equal to that angle. 

What's the angle between DG and JL at B? Let's see. At point B, line DG is present (since B is on DG), and line JL passes through B (since B is on JL). Therefore, the angle between DG and JL at B is the angle between DG and line JL at point B. 

But line JL connects J to L. Earlier, we had that J is on CE, and L is connected via line TL (since B is on line TL, and J is also on line TL). Also, point L is connected to B and D (from angle 1: ∠(L,B,D)). 

Maybe I need to find that angle. Alternatively, since we know angle 9 is 75°, which relates to angle at J between B and E. Let me try to find relations between these angles.

Alternatively, since we have DG || EC, and line JL intersects DG at B and EC at J (since J is on EC). Therefore, the angle between DG and JL at B is equal to the angle between EC and JL at J. 

That angle between EC and JL at J is ∠(J, E, L)? Wait, no. JL connects J to L. Since J is on EC, and L is another point. So, at point J, line JL extends towards L, and line EC extends towards E and C. Therefore, the angle between EC and JL at J is ∠(E,J,L). 

But we also have angle 9, which is ∠(B,J,E) = 75°. So, if we consider triangle JEB or something. 

Wait, if DG || EC, and line JL intersects DG at B and EC at J, then the angle between DG and JL at B equals the angle between EC and JL at J. So, angle between DG and JL at B equals angle between EC and JL at J. 

But angle between DG and JL at B is the angle between DG (line DG) and JL (line JL) at B. Since DG is a straight line, and JL is another line passing through B. The angle between them at B is the angle between DG and line JL. 

And angle between EC and JL at J is the angle between EC (line EC) and line JL at J. Since J is on EC, this angle is between line EC (which is itself) and line JL. 

So, that angle would be ∠(E,J,L), since JL goes from J to L. So, ∠(E,J,L) = angle between EC and JL at J. 

Therefore, ∠(E,J,L) = angle between DG and JL at B. 

But how does that help us? Maybe combining with other angles.

We also have angle 9 = ∠(B,J,E) = 75°, which is at J between B and E. So, that's part of triangle JBE or something. 

Perhaps if I can find ∠(E,J,L), which is equal to the angle between DG and JL at B. Let's call that angle x. So, x = ∠(E,J,L) = angle between DG and JL at B.

Then, at point J, we have ∠(E,J,L) + ∠(B,J,E) = 180° if lines EL and JB are supplementary. Wait, not necessarily unless they are linear pairs. 

Wait, if JL is a straight line extending from J through L, and EC is a straight line through J. So, at point J, the lines JL and EC meet. So, the angle between EC and JL at J is ∠(E,J,L), and angle between EB and JL at J is ∠(B,J,E) = 75°. Are these angles adjacent? 

Yes! Because EB is part of EC (since J is on EC, and E is another point on EC). So, line EB is along EC. Therefore, at point J, the line JL makes an angle with EC (which is line EB extended). So, ∠(E,J,L) and ∠(B,J,E) are adjacent angles forming a linear pair? Or maybe not directly. 

Wait, ∠(E,J,L) is between EJ and JL, and ∠(B,J,E) is between BJ and EJ. So, together, they form the angle between BJ and JL. Wait, no. Let me clarify:

At point J, we have:

- Line EC passes through J, with E and C on either side.

- Line JL passes through J, going towards L.

So, ∠(E,J,L) is the angle between EJ and JL.

∠(B,J,E) is the angle between BJ and EJ.

These two angles share the side EJ, and their non-common sides are JL and BJ. Therefore, the sum of ∠(E,J,L) and ∠(B,J,E) is equal to the angle between JL and BJ at J, which would be ∠(B,J,L). 

But unless there's more info, not sure. However, earlier we established that ∠(E,J,L) = angle between DG and JL at B. Let me call that angle x. 

So, x = ∠(E,J,L) = angle between DG and JL at B.

At point B, line DG and line JL meet. So, the angle between DG and JL at B is x. 

But we also have angle at B between DG and JB (which is angle 3 = 75°). Wait, because angle 3 is ∠(J,B,G), which we determined is equal to the angle between JB and DG at B, which is 75°. 

So, at point B, there is line DG and line JL (since B is on JL). So, the angle between DG and JL at B is x, and the angle between DG and JB at B is 75°. But since JB is part of JL (since F is on JL and B is on JL), then JB is along JL. Wait, if F is on JL, then line JL passes through B and F. So, JB is part of JL. Therefore, the angle between DG and JL at B is the same as the angle between DG and JB at B, which is 75°. So, x = 75°, meaning that ∠(E,J,L) = 75°. 

Therefore, ∠(E,J,L) = 75°. 

Now, returning to point J, where ∠(E,J,L) = 75°, and ∠(B,J,E) = 75°, which are adjacent angles. Their sum would be the total angle between EJ and JL, but wait, no—actually, they are adjacent angles sharing the side EJ. Let me draw this mentally: 

At point J, line EJ extends to E and C. Line JL extends from J to L. So, the angle between EJ and JL is ∠(E,J,L) = 75°, and the angle between BJ and EJ is ∠(B,J,E) = 75°. These two angles are adjacent, forming a larger angle at J between BJ and JL. So, the total angle between BJ and JL is ∠(B,J,L) = ∠(B,J,E) + ∠(E,J,L) = 75° + 75° = 150°. 

Wait, but that would imply that ∠(B,J,L) = 150°. Is there a way to use this?

But I'm not sure. Let's think differently. Since we have that angle between DG and JL at B is 75°, and DG || IM, then the angle between IM and JL at F is also 75°. Because DG || IM, and JL is a transversal. Therefore, the angle between DG and JL at B equals the angle between IM and JL at F. 

So, at point F, the angle between IM and JL is 75°. But ∠(B,F,M) is the angle at F between B and M, which is along IM. Since F is on line IM, and line JL passes through F (since F is on JL). So, the angle between IM (which is FM) and JL (which is FB) at F is 75°, which is exactly ∠(B,F,M) = angle 5. 

Therefore, angle 5 = 75°. Wait, but that would suggest angle 5 is 75°, but I need to verify. 

Wait, if the angle between IM and JL at F is 75°, and since FM is part of IM, and FB is part of JL (since F is on JL and B is on JL), then yes, ∠(B,F,M) is that angle. So, angle 5 = 75°. 

But hold on, the question asks for angle 6, which is ∠(M,F,T). So, angle 6 is at point F between M and T. 

To find angle 6, we need to relate it to other angles. Let me think about point F. 

F is on line IM (so FM is part of IM), and also on line BT (so FT is part of BT). Also, F is on line JL. So, lines IM, BT, and JL all pass through F. 

From earlier, we found that angle 5 (which is ∠(B,F,M)) is 75°. So, at point F, we have angle between BF (part of JL) and FM (part of IM) being 75°. 

Now, considering line BT passing through F. So, FT is part of BT. So, at point F, we have line FT (part of BT) and line FM (part of IM). So, the angle between FT and FM at F is angle between BT and IM at F. 

But IM is parallel to DG (given), and BT is a line. Is there any relation between BT and DG? Not directly stated, but maybe through other elements.

Alternatively, since DG || IM, and if there's a transversal intersecting them, such as line BT (which passes through F). Wait, line BT passes through F, which is on IM. So, line BT intersects IM at F. 

So, since DG || IM, and line BT intersects IM at F, then the angle between BT and IM at F is equal to the angle between BT and DG at some point. 

Wait, if DG || IM, then the angle between BT and IM at F is equal to the angle between BT and DG at the point where BT intersects DG. But where does BT intersect DG? 

Point B is on DG (from point-on-line condition: Point B lies on line DG). Also, point B is on line JL, which includes F. Wait, line BT passes through F, which is on line JL. But B is on line JL, so BT intersects DG at B. 

Therefore, line BT intersects DG at B and IM at F. Since DG || IM, then the angle between BT and IM at F is equal to the angle between BT and DG at B. 

Therefore, ∠(BT, IM) at F = ∠(BT, DG) at B. 

But ∠(BT, DG) at B is the angle between BT and DG at B. What is that angle? 

At point B, line DG is present, and line BT passes through B. So, the angle between DG and BT at B is the angle between DG and BT. 

But earlier, we had that at point B, the angle between DG and JB is 75°, and JB is part of JL, which is part of BT? Wait, no. Wait, F is on line JL, and BT is another line. 

Wait, earlier we said that point J is on line BT (from point-on-line condition: Point J lies on line BT). Also, point B is on line JL, and F is on line JL. So, line JL passes through B and F, and since J is on BT, then line JL is part of BT? No, because J is on BT, and F is on JL and BT. Wait, line JL passes through J and B, and F is on JL. Also, F is on BT. Therefore, line JL intersects BT at F. So, line JL and BT intersect at F. 

Wait, but point B is on line JL and line DG. Also, line BT passes through B and J (since J is on BT). So, line BT passes through B and J, and F is a point on BT. 

Therefore, line BT passes through B and J, and F is another point on BT. So, points B, F, J are colinear on line BT. Wait, no, because F is on line BT (from point-on-line condition: Point F lies on line BT), and J is also on line BT (from point-on-line condition: Point J lies on line BT). So, points B, F, J are colinear on line BT? Or are they arranged in some order?

Wait, point B is on line DG and on line JL. Point F is on line JL and on line BT. Point J is on line BT and on line CE. So, since F is on line JL and on line BT, and J is on line BT, then F is between B and J or vice versa? 

Not sure, but regardless, since F is on BT, and line BT passes through B and J. So, the angle between DG and BT at B is the angle between DG and BT at point B. 

But we know that at point B, the angle between DG and JB is 75°, which is angle 3. But JB is part of line JL, which is part of line BT? No, line JL is separate from BT unless they overlap. Wait, earlier we said that line JL passes through B and F, and line BT passes through B and J. Since F is on both JL and BT, then lines JL and BT intersect at F. Wait, but point B is on line JL. So, if line JL and line BT intersect at F, and B is on line JL, then B is either F or another intersection point. But since F is on line JL and line BT, and B is on line JL and line DG, then unless F=B, which isn't necessarily the case. 

Wait, this is confusing. Let me try to rephrase:

- Line JL passes through points J, B, and F (since F is on JL).

- Line BT passes through points B, J, and F (since F is on BT and J is on BT).

Therefore, points B, J, F are colinear on line BT and line JL. Therefore, F is on line BT, and since B is on line JL, which is also part of BT? Wait, no. Line JL is a separate line from BT unless they are the same line. 

But if line JL and line BT both contain points B and J, then they must be the same line. Therefore, line JL is the same as line BT. Wait, but earlier we had that line JL is part of line BT. 

Wait, let me confirm. From the constraints:

- Point B lies on line JL (PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(J, L)))

- Point J lies on line BT (PointLiesOnLine(J, Line(B, T)))

- Point F lies on line JL (PointLiesOnLine(F, Line(J, L)))

- Point F lies on line BT (PointLiesOnLine(F, Line(B, T)))

Therefore, since F is on both JL and BT, and B is on JL and J is on BT, then lines JL and BT intersect at B and J? Wait, no. If line JL contains B and J, and line BT contains B and J, then lines JL and BT are the same line. Therefore, line JL is the same as line BT. 

So, line JL is line BT. Therefore, line JL is line BT. So, points J, B, L are on line BT. 

Ah! That simplifies things. So, line JL is line BT. Therefore, F is on line BT. 

So, line BT contains points B, J, F, L. 

Therefore, points B, J, F, L are colinear on line BT. 

So, the angle between DG and BT at B is the angle between DG and BT at point B. Which we previously thought was related to angle 3. 

But earlier, we had that angle between DG and JB at B is 75°, which is angle 3. Since JB is part of line BT (now confirmed), then the angle between DG and BT at B is 75°, which is angle 3. 

So, angle between DG and BT at B is 75°. 

Now, returning to the earlier idea that since DG || IM, and line BT intersects DG at B and IM at F, the angle between BT and IM at F is equal to the angle between BT and DG at B, which is 75°. 

Therefore, the angle between BT and IM at F is 75°. 

But angle between BT and IM at F is ∠(T,F,M) or something? Wait, at point F, line IM passes through F, and line BT passes through F. The angle between IM and BT at F is the angle between IM (which is line FM) and BT (which is line FT). Therefore, ∠(F,T,M) or ∠(T,F,M)? 

Wait, the angle at F between IM and BT is ∠(T,F,M) if T is on BT and M is on IM. Wait, point T is on BT (since F is on BT, and T is another point on BT). Also, M is on IM. 

So, at point F, the angle between BT (which is line FT) and IM (which is line FM) is ∠(T,F,M). 

Therefore, ∠(T,F,M) = 75°. 

But wait, angle 6 is ∠(M,F,T), which is the same as ∠(T,F,M). So, angle 6 = 75°. But that would mean the answer is A. However, the given answer choices include A as 75, but let me check if this is correct. 

Wait, but earlier steps assumed that angle between BT and IM at F is equal to angle between BT and DG at B, which is 75°, making angle 6 = 75°. But the given answer choices have option A as 75. However, sometimes there might be errors in assumptions. Let me verify again.

Wait, angle between BT and IM at F is equal to angle between BT and DG at B because DG || IM. Yes, because when two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal. Here, DG || IM, and BT is the transversal. So, the angle between DG and BT at B is equal to the angle between IM and BT at F. 

Therefore, ∠(T,F,M) = 75°, which is angle 6. Therefore, angle 6 is 75°, so the answer is A. But the initial given value was m∠9 = 75°, which led us to angle 3 = 75°, and then eventually angle 6 = 75°. 

However, this seems too straightforward. Let me cross-check with other possibilities. 

Wait, is there a possibility that angle between BT and IM at F is supplementary to 75°, depending on the direction of the transversal? For example, if the angle is on the opposite side. 

But in general, corresponding angles are equal. Depending on which side of the transversal you take, but assuming the usual configuration, it should be equal. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in assuming that the angle between BT and IM at F is the same as angle 6. Let me recheck the definition of angle 6. 

Angle 6 is ∠(M,F,T), which is the angle at F between M and T. So, yes, that is the angle between FM and FT at F, which is the same as the angle between IM and BT at F, which we said is 75°. 

So, according to this, angle 6 = 75°, so answer A. But why is there an option A? The original problem gives m∠9 = 75°, which is used to derive angle 3 = 75°, then angle 5 = 75°, and finally angle 6 = 75°. 

But let me think if there's any missing step. Could there be a case where the angle is actually supplementary? For example, if the transversal creates an obtuse angle instead of acute? 

For example, suppose DG is horizontal, and IM is parallel to DG. Line BT crosses DG at B, creating an angle of 75°, then at point F on IM, the corresponding angle would also be 75°. Unless the lines are on opposite sides, but without a diagram, it's hard to tell. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another relationship involving other angles. Let me think about other parts of the diagram. 

For example, we also have that DG || EC, and line JL (which is BT) intersects DG at B and EC at J. Earlier, we found that ∠(E,J,L) = 75°, which might relate to other angles. 

But if angle 6 is indeed 75°, then answer A. But I want to make sure there are no mistakes in my logic. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 6 is supplementary to 75°, making it 105°, which is option D. How? 

If the angle between BT and IM at F is actually supplementary to 75°, then it would be 180 - 75 = 105°. Why would that be the case? 

It depends on which angle we're talking about. When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, the corresponding angles are equal, but sometimes people refer to the angle on the other side. For example, if the transversal crosses the parallel lines, creating an 'F' shape, then the corresponding angles are the ones that are in matching corners. 

If DG is above IM, and BT is a transversal crossing DG at B and IM at F, then the angle at B (between DG and BT) would correspond to the angle at F (between IM and BT). But depending on the direction of the transversal, it could be the same or supplementary. 

Wait, but in our case, the angle at B between DG and BT is 75°, which is an acute angle. If the transversal BT crosses DG at B and IM at F, then the corresponding angle at F would also be acute, so 75°. But if the angle at F were on the other side, it might be obtuse. 

But without knowing the exact orientation, it's ambiguous. However, in most cases, corresponding angles are considered to be equal. So, if the angle between DG and BT at B is 75°, then the corresponding angle between IM and BT at F is also 75°, making angle 6 = 75°. 

However, let me think of another approach. Suppose we consider triangle IMF or something. 

But since F is on IM, and T is on BT, which is line JL. Not sure. 

Alternatively, since DG || EC, and we had angle 9 = 75°, which is ∠(B,J,E), and we derived angle 3 = 75°, angle 5 = 75°, and angle 6 = 75°, then all of these are equal. But the question is asking for angle 6. 

But if the answer is 75°, which is option A, but sometimes problems might trick you into thinking it's 75° when it's actually different. Let me check once more. 

Wait, in the beginning, I assumed that the angle between BT and IM at F is equal to the angle between BT and DG at B, which is 75°. But what if that angle is actually the supplement? For example, if the lines are crossed in a certain way. 

Imagine DG is horizontal, IM is horizontal (since parallel), and BT is a line crossing DG at B, making a 75° angle upwards. Then, at point F on IM, the corresponding angle would also be 75°, measured in the same direction. So, the angle between BT and IM at F is still 75°. 

Alternatively, if the angle at B is 75°, then the angle at F could be 75° or 180-75=105°, depending on which side of the line we take. 

But in the context of the problem, angle 6 is defined as ∠(M,F,T). Assuming that the diagram is drawn in a standard way, where the lines are oriented such that the angle is the smaller one, it would be 75°. 

But given that the answer choices include 105°, which is option D, I wonder if there's an error in my reasoning. 

Let me think of another path. Let's consider that angle 5 = 75°, as previously deduced. Then, what about other angles?

For example, at point F, we have angle 5 = 75°, which is ∠(B,F,M). Also, at point F, there's line FT (part of BT) and line FM (part of IM). So, the angle between FT and FM at F is angle 6. 

But if we can find the measure of that angle. 

Since angle between BT and IM at F is 75°, and angle between BT and FM at F is angle 6, but FM is part of IM, so that angle is 75°. So, angle 6 is 75°, making answer A. 

But if I made a mistake in assuming the correspondence, maybe it's supplementary. For example, if the angle at B is 75°, then the angle at F could be 180 - 75 = 105°, depending on whether it's consecutive interior angles. 

Wait, if DG || IM, and BT is a transversal, then the consecutive interior angles would be supplementary. But the angle at B (between DG and BT) and the angle at F (between IM and BT) would be consecutive interior angles if they are on the same side of the transversal. 

Wait, consecutive interior angles are supplementary. So, if the lines DG and IM are parallel, and BT is a transversal, then the consecutive interior angles would add up to 180°. 

But what are the consecutive interior angles? They are the angles on the same side of the transversal. 

So, if at point B, the angle between DG and BT is 75°, then the consecutive interior angle at F would be on the same side of BT, which would be the angle between IM and BT at F. 

Therefore, those two angles would add up to 180°. So, 75° + angle at F = 180°, so angle at F = 105°. 

Ah! So, this changes everything. Previously, I thought they were corresponding angles, but if they are consecutive interior angles, they are supplementary. 

So, which one is it? Corresponding or consecutive? 

Depends on the position of the transversal. If the transversal BT crosses DG at B and IM at F, then the angle at B (between DG and BT) and the angle at F (between IM and BT) are consecutive interior angles if they are on the same side of the transversal. 

But to determine this, we need to know the relative positions. 

Assume that DG is above IM, and BT is slanting downward from B to F. So, at point B, the angle between DG (upward) and BT (downward) is 75°, and at point F, the angle between IM (also upward) and BT (downward) would be on the same side, making them consecutive interior angles. Hence, supplementary. 

Thus, angle at F = 180° - 75° = 105°. 

Therefore, angle 6 = 105°, which is option D. 

This would resolve the confusion. So, where did I go wrong earlier? Initially, I assumed corresponding angles, but it's actually consecutive interior angles, which are supplementary. 

So, the correct calculation is 180° - 75° = 105°, making angle 6 = 105°, so answer D. 

Let me verify this logic. 

When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, the consecutive interior angles are supplementary. In this case, DG || IM, and BT is the transversal. The angle at B between DG and BT is 75°, and the angle at F between IM and BT would be its consecutive interior angle, thus adding to 180°. 

Therefore, angle 6 = 105°, making the answer D. 

This aligns with the presence of option D, and suggests that my earlier assumption about corresponding angles was incorrect. 

Therefore, the correct answer is D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we begin by analyzing the geometric constraints and identifying the relationships among the given angles and lines. The critical insight lies in understanding the role of **parallel lines** and how they interact with **transversals**, particularly focusing on **consecutive interior angles**.

---

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

#### 1. **Identify Key Angle Relationships**

We are told:

- $ \angle 9 = \angle (B, J, E) = 75^\circ $
- Several angles are equated to other angles (e.g., $ \angle (L, B, D) = \text{angle } 1 $, etc.)
- Important geometric facts:
  - $ \overleftrightarrow{DG} \parallel \overleftrightarrow{IM} $
  - $ \overleftrightarrow{DG} \parallel \overleftrightarrow{EC} $

From this, we conclude:  
$$
\overleftrightarrow{IM} \parallel \overleftrightarrow{EC}
$$

---

#### 2. **Use of Parallel Lines and Transversals**

The key geometric property we apply is that **when two parallel lines are cut by a transversal**, the **consecutive interior angles** are **supplementary** (i.e., their measures add up to $ 180^\circ $).

Here, $ \overleftrightarrow{BT} $ acts as a **transversal** intersecting both $ \overleftrightarrow{DG} $ and $ \overleftrightarrow{IM} $.  

Let’s denote:

- $ \angle (DG, BT) $ at point **B** (i.e., the angle between $ \overleftrightarrow{DG} $ and $ \overleftrightarrow{BT} $) = $ \angle 3 = 75^\circ $ (as derived from the equality with $ \angle (J, B, G) $).
- The corresponding **consecutive interior angle** at point **F** (the intersection of $ \overleftrightarrow{IM} $ and $ \overleftrightarrow{BT} $) will therefore be:

$$
\angle (\text{IM}, \overleftrightarrow{BT}) = 180^\circ - 75^\circ = 105^\circ
$$

This angle is precisely $ \angle (M, F, T) $, which is defined as $ \angle 6 $.

---

### Final Conclusion:

$$
m\angle 6 = 105^\circ
$$

Hence, the correct answer is:

$$
\boxed{\text{D}}
$$
