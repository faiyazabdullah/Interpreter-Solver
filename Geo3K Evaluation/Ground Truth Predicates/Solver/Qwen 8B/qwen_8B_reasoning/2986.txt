<think>
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So first, I need to parse all the given information and figure out how to find the value of x. Let me start by listing out all the given constraints:

1. The length of line segment SR is 9 units.
2. The length of line segment UT is x units (this is what we need to find).
3. The length of line segment TS is 5 units.
4. Point T lies on the line US. So points U, T, S are colinear, with T somewhere between them? Or maybe extended?
5. Points U, T, and R lie on a circle centered at point A with radius 4.0. Wait, so U, T, R are all on the same circle with center A and radius 4?

Wait, hold on. Let me rephrase these constraints more carefully.

First, the lines mentioned:

- Length of SR = 9. So points S and R are 9 units apart.

- Length of UT = x. So points U and T are separated by x units.

- Length of TS = 5. So points T and S are 5 units apart.

Then, there are some point-on-line conditions:

- Point T lies on the line US. That means that T is somewhere along the straight line connecting U and S. So the points U, T, S are colinear, with T being between U and S? Not necessarily; it could be that T is beyond U or beyond S. But since TS is 5, and UT is x, then depending on where T is located, the total length US would be either UT + TS or |UT - TS|.

But also, points U, T, and R are on a circle centered at A with radius 4.0. Wait, the problem says:

PointLiesOnCircle(U, Circle(A, radius_4_0)) → So point U is on the circle centered at A with radius 4.

Similarly for T and R: both T and R are on the same circle. Therefore, points U, T, R are all lying on a circle of radius 4 around point A. So triangle UTR is inscribed in a circle of radius 4. Hmm, but maybe not a triangle unless they are non-colinear. However, since U, T, and R are on the same circle, their distances from A are all equal to 4.

Now, the question is to find x, which is the length of UT. Given that TS is 5, and SR is 9, and T is on line US. Also, U, T, R are on the circle with radius 4. 

Let me try to visualize this. Let me sketch mentally.

We have points U, T, S colinear, with T between U and S? Maybe not necessarily. Let's suppose that T is between U and S. Then the distance from U to T is x, and from T to S is 5, so the entire length US is x + 5. Alternatively, if T is not between U and S, then perhaps US would be |x - 5|. But without knowing the exact position, maybe we can figure it out based on other constraints.

Also, points U, T, R are on the circle of radius 4. So the distance from each of these points to A is 4. So AU = AT = AR = 4. Wait, but R is another point on the same circle. So point R is also on the circle centered at A with radius 4. Now, SR is 9. So the distance between S and R is 9. But R is on the circle centered at A with radius 4. So S is a point outside that circle, because the distance from S to R is 9, and R is only 4 away from A. So S might be outside the circle.

But how do these points relate? Let me think about coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates will help here.

Let me set up coordinate system. Let me assume that point A is at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since U, T, R are on the circle of radius 4, their coordinates satisfy x² + y² = 16.

But how to place points U, T, S, R? Let me see.

Since T lies on line US, and we know TS = 5. Also, SR = 9. Let me consider coordinates for U, T, S such that T is on line US.

Let me denote coordinates as follows:

Let’s assume that line US is horizontal for simplicity. Let me assign coordinates to make calculations easier.

Suppose that point T is somewhere on the line US. Let me define coordinates for U and S such that T is between them. Let me let U be at (u_x, u_y), S be at (s_x, s_y). But since T is on line US, we can parametrize that line. But maybe even better, since we can choose coordinates to simplify.

Alternatively, since we have circles involved, maybe we can use power of a point or something related to circles.

Another approach: Since U, T, R are on the circle centered at A with radius 4. So AU = AT = AR = 4. Also, RS = 9. So R is a point on the circle, and S is a point such that RS = 9. So the distance between R and S is 9. But since R is on the circle (distance from A is 4), then S is outside the circle, and RS = 9. So maybe using triangle inequality here?

But how does that connect with the rest?

Also, considering that T is on line US. Let me recall that when a point lies on a line through two other points, sometimes you can apply Menelaus' theorem or similar concepts. But maybe more straightforwardly, since T is on US, then ST * TU = ?

Wait, but we have lengths involving T. For example, TS = 5, and UT = x. If T is between U and S, then US = UT + TS = x + 5. Otherwise, if T is not between them, say T is beyond S, then US = UT - TS = x - 5. Similarly, if T is beyond U, then US = TS - UT = 5 - x. But since lengths are positive, we need to ensure that.

But how to determine whether T is between U and S or not? Well, since R is connected to S via RS = 9, and R is on the circle, maybe we can find relations between these.

Alternatively, think about triangles involving points A, S, R, etc. Since R is on the circle centered at A with radius 4, and S is a point such that RS = 9. So the distance between S and R is fixed. Also, since T is on line US, and T is on the circle as well. So maybe applying power of a point with respect to point S?

Power of a point S with respect to circle A. The power of point S with respect to circle A is equal to SA^2 - r^2, where r is the radius of the circle. Here, r = 4. Also, power of S is equal to the square of the tangent from S to the circle. But since T is on line US and also on the circle, then ST * SU = power of S with respect to circle A.

Wait, yes! Power of a point formula states that if a line passes through a point S and intersects the circle at two points, say U and T, then the product of the distances from S to each intersection point equals the power of S with respect to the circle. In this case, line US intersects the circle at U and T. Therefore, SU * ST = power of S with respect to the circle.

Wait, but wait: if T is on the line US and on the circle, then the power of S with respect to the circle is equal to ST * SU', where U' is the other intersection point. Wait, actually, the power should be ST * SU, but depending on the position of T relative to U.

Wait, the general formula is: if a line through S intersects the circle at X and Y, then SX * SY = power of S. So if S is outside the circle, then SX and SY are signed lengths, but if we take absolute values, it's equal to the square of the tangent length.

In our case, line US passes through S and intersects the circle at U and T. So, assuming that S is outside the circle (since R is on the circle and RS=9, which is longer than radius 4, implying that S is outside). Therefore, the power of S with respect to the circle is equal to SU * ST = (length from S to U) multiplied by (length from S to T).

But wait, need to be careful with signs. If T is between S and U, then SU would be the distance from S to U, and ST would be from S to T. But since T is between S and U, then ST is part of SU. So SU = ST + TU. But let me clarify.

Let me denote:

If T is between S and U, then SU = ST + TU. Wait, no. Suppose we have points arranged as S --- T ---- U. Then SU = ST + TU. But if the line US goes from U to S, passing through T, then depending on direction. Alternatively, perhaps better to think in terms of directed segments.

But maybe using absolute values. The power of point S with respect to the circle is equal to ST * SU, where ST and SU are lengths. Wait, no, the formula is that if the line through S intersects the circle at two points, say P and Q, then SP * SQ = power of S. In our case, the line passes through S and intersects the circle at U and T. So SP * SQ would be SU * ST, but need to check the sign convention. Assuming S is outside the circle, then both SP and SQ are in the same direction. Wait, if S is outside, and the line passes through U and T (both on the circle), then the power is SU * ST, but depending on the order of points.

Wait, suppose that S is outside the circle, and the line through S intersects the circle at U and T. Then the power of S is equal to SU * ST, where SU is the distance from S to U, and ST is the distance from S to T. However, if T is between S and U, then SU is longer than ST, and the power would be SU * ST. Wait, but that seems conflicting with standard formula. Wait, the formula is actually that if you have a secant line passing through S, intersecting the circle at P and Q, then SP * SQ = power of S. If S is outside, then SP and SQ are both measured from S to each intersection point, so if P and Q are on the line, then SP * SQ = (SP)(SQ) where SP and SQ are the lengths from S to each point.

So if S is outside, and the line passes through U and T, then depending on the order of points. For example, if the order is S-U-T, then SP would be SU and SQ would be ST, but since T is further away from S than U, then SP = SU and SQ = ST? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, if S is outside, and the line goes through U and T, with U closer to S than T, then SU is shorter than ST. So the power would be SU * ST. Wait, but actually, the formula is that the power is equal to the product of the distances from S to each intersection point. So regardless of order, it's SU * ST. But in reality, if the points are ordered S-U-T, then SU is the length from S to U, and ST is from S to T, so the product is SU * ST. However, in reality, the power is also equal to (ST)^2 - r^2, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe I should express the power of S as SA² - r², where SA is the distance from S to the center A, and r is the radius of the circle. Then, according to power of a point, SU * ST = SA² - r².

Yes, that's right. So if I can compute SA, then I can find SU * ST.

But how do I find SA?

Well, we know that R is on the circle, so RA = 4. And RS = 9. So triangle RSA has sides RA = 4, RS = 9, and SA is the distance from S to A. By the Law of Cosines, SA² = RA² + RS² - 2*RA*RS*cos(theta), where theta is the angle at R. But we don't know theta. However, perhaps there's another way.

Alternatively, since R is on the circle, and we might have other relationships. Wait, but maybe we can use coordinates again.

Let me try setting coordinates. Let me assume that point A is at (0,0). Let me place point R at some coordinate on the circle, say (4, 0), since the circle has radius 4. Then, point S is such that RS = 9. So the distance between R(4, 0) and S(x, y) is 9. So:

√[(x - 4)^2 + (y - 0)^2] = 9 → (x - 4)^2 + y^2 = 81.

Additionally, point S is connected to T and U, which are on the circle. Also, T lies on line US. Also, U is on the circle. Let me assume that line US passes through T, which is also on the circle. So line US connects U and S, with T being a point on that line and also on the circle.

But without knowing where exactly U and T are, this might get complicated. However, maybe we can use the power of point S.

Earlier idea: power of S w.r.t. circle A is SU * ST = SA² - r². We can compute SA² as (SA)^2, which is the square of the distance from S to A. Also, r = 4, so r² = 16.

Therefore, SU * ST = SA² - 16.

But we need to find SA. How?

But we know that RS = 9, and R is on the circle (AR = 4). So, triangle SAR has sides AR = 4, RS = 9, and AS. Using the Law of Cosines:

AS² = AR² + RS² - 2 * AR * RS * cos(angle at R)

But angle at R is unknown. However, unless we have more info, this may not help directly. But maybe there's another relation.

Alternatively, since we have multiple points on the circle, like U and T, which are on line US. Let me think. Let me consider that SU * ST = power of S = SA² - 16.

But SU * ST is also equal to (SU)(ST). Let me note that T is on line US, so depending on the position of T relative to U and S, SU can be expressed in terms of ST and UT.

For instance, if T is between U and S, then SU = ST + TU. Wait, no. Let me define the positions properly. Let me imagine that S is outside the circle, and line US passes through T (on the circle) and U (also on the circle). So the line passes through two points of the circle: U and T. So S is outside, and the line passes through U and T. So SU is the distance from S to U, and ST is the distance from S to T. Depending on the order, if T is between S and U, then SU = ST + TU. But if U is between S and T, then SU = ST - TU. However, since both U and T are on the circle, and S is outside, then the line passes through S, then U, then T? Or vice versa?

Actually, if S is outside the circle, and the line passes through two points on the circle, then the points U and T are on the line, with S outside. So the line passes through S, then enters the circle at one point, then exits at another. So, for example, the line could pass through S, then enter the circle at T, then exit at U, or the reverse. So depending on which order, the power of point S is ST * SU, where ST and SU are the lengths from S to T and S to U respectively.

But since both T and U are on the circle, then ST and SU would be the lengths from S to each intersection point. So regardless of order, the product ST * SU equals the power of S. 

But in our case, we have two points on the circle along line US: U and T. So the power of S is SU * ST. But SU is the distance from S to U, and ST is the distance from S to T. However, if T is between S and U, then SU = ST + TU. Wait, no. If S----T----U, then SU = ST + TU. But then ST is the distance from S to T, and TU is from T to U. So SU = ST + TU. Therefore, SU * ST = (ST + TU) * ST = ST^2 + ST*TU. But I don't know if that helps yet.

Alternatively, maybe I can express SU in terms of ST and TU. But I need to find x, which is UT. Let me denote UT = x. Also, TS = 5. So if T is between S and U, then SU = ST + TU = 5 + x. Then, power of S is SU * ST = (5 + x)*5. But wait, no. Wait, the power of S is ST * SU? Or ST * SU?

Wait, no. Earlier, the power is equal to ST * SU, but that depends on how the points are arranged. If S is outside, and the line passes through T and U, then power is ST * SU? Wait, no. It should be ST * SU, but if S is outside, and the line passes through T and U, then the power is equal to (distance from S to T) * (distance from S to U)? No, that can't be. Because if S is outside, and the line passes through two points on the circle, then the power should be equal to (ST)*(SU'), where U' is the other intersection. Wait, but if the line passes through T and U, then the power is ST * SU, where ST and SU are the distances from S to each of the intersection points. But if the line passes through S, then enters the circle at one point, exits at another. So suppose that the line passes through S, then enters at T, then exits at U. So the power would be ST * SU, where ST is the distance from S to T, and SU is the distance from S to U. Wait, but if T is the entry point and U is the exit point, then the power is ST * SU, but that would mean that SU is the distance from S to U, which is longer than ST. 

But how does this relate to the previous expression?

Alternatively, maybe the power of point S is equal to ST * SU, where ST and SU are the lengths from S to each intersection point. But if the points are ordered S---T---U, then SU would be ST + TU, and ST is just ST. So power of S is ST * SU = ST*(ST + TU). But I also have that power of S is SA² - r². So combining these equations:

ST * SU = SA² - 16.

But SA is the distance from S to A. To find SA, perhaps we can use triangle SAR. Since R is on the circle, AR = 4, and RS = 9. So triangle SAR has sides AR = 4, RS = 9, and SA. So by the Law of Cosines:

SA² = AR² + RS² - 2 * AR * RS * cos(theta), where theta is the angle at R.

But we don't know theta. However, if we can find SA in terms of other variables...

Alternatively, maybe there's another relationship. Since U is on the circle, so AU = 4. So triangle AUS has AU = 4, AS = ?, and US = SU (which is ST + TU if T is between S and U). But I don't know if that helps.

Wait, but earlier, we had that power of S is ST * SU = SA² - 16. Also, if we can write SA² in terms of other quantities... Maybe using coordinates?

Earlier, I considered placing R at (4, 0), and S somewhere else. Let me go back to that. Let me assume that A is at (0, 0), and R is at (4, 0). Then, point S is at some location (x, y) such that RS = 9. So:

Distance from R(4, 0) to S(x, y) is √[(x - 4)^2 + (y)^2] = 9 → (x - 4)^2 + y^2 = 81.

Also, point S is connected to U and T, which are on the circle centered at A(0,0) with radius 4. So U and T are points on the circle x² + y² = 16.

Moreover, T lies on line US. So line US connects U and S, and T is a point on that line which is also on the circle.

But how can I relate this?

Maybe parametrize line US. Let me denote parametrically the line through U and S. Let me assume that U is some point on the circle, and S is external. Then, the line US intersects the circle at U and T. So, using parametric equations, I can find T.

But this seems too abstract. Perhaps instead, using vector methods or coordinates.

Alternatively, since we have two expressions involving SA². From power of point S: ST * SU = SA² - 16. And from triangle SAR: SA² = AR² + RS² - 2 * AR * RS * cos(theta). But without knowing theta, this seems unmanageable.

Wait, but if we can find SA² using coordinates. Since R is at (4, 0), and S is at (x, y), then SA² = x² + y². And from the equation above, (x - 4)^2 + y^2 = 81 → expanding gives x² - 8x + 16 + y² = 81 → x² + y² = 8x + 65. Thus SA² = x² + y² = 8x + 65.

So SA² = 8x + 65. Therefore, power of S is SA² - 16 = 8x + 65 - 16 = 8x + 49.

But power of S is also equal to ST * SU. So ST * SU = 8x + 49.

Now, we need to express ST * SU in terms of known quantities.

From before, if T is on line US, then SU is the distance from S to U, and ST is the distance from S to T. But since T is on line US, and U is on the circle, we can relate SU and ST.

Let me think: Let's consider that line US intersects the circle at U and T. So S is outside the circle, and the line passes through U and T. So the power of S is SU * ST = 8x + 49.

But SU is the distance from S to U, and ST is the distance from S to T. However, we need to relate these to the given lengths.

Wait, but we also know that TS = 5. So the distance from T to S is 5. Which is the same as ST = 5. So ST = 5. Then, SU is the distance from S to U. So SU * ST = SU * 5 = 8x + 49. Hence, SU = (8x + 49)/5.

But SU is also the distance from S to U. Now, since U is on the circle, AU = 4. So triangle ASU has sides AS, AU = 4, and SU.

Using the Law of Cosines on triangle ASU:

SU² = AS² + AU² - 2 * AS * AU * cos(angle SAU).

But AS² is already known: AS² = 8x + 65 (from earlier). AU is 4, so:

SU² = (8x + 65) + 16 - 2 * sqrt(8x + 65) * 4 * cos(angle SAU).

Hmm, this seems complex because we don't know the angle. But maybe there's another way.

Alternatively, since U is on the circle centered at A, then AU = 4. Also, SU is the distance from S to U, which we've denoted as SU = (8x + 49)/5. So SU = (8x + 49)/5.

But we also have that SU can be found using coordinates. Since S is at (x, y), and U is a point on the circle x² + y² = 16. Let me denote U as (u_x, u_y), which satisfies u_x² + u_y² = 16.

The distance SU is sqrt[(x - u_x)^2 + (y - u_y)^2]. Squaring that gives (x - u_x)^2 + (y - u_y)^2 = SU².

But we also have that SU = (8x + 49)/5. So:

(x - u_x)^2 + (y - u_y)^2 = [(8x + 49)/5]^2.

This seems too many variables. Maybe there's a different approach.

Wait, going back to the power of a point. We had power of S = ST * SU = 8x + 49. Also, ST is 5, so SU = (8x + 49)/5. But SU is also the distance from S to U, which can be written as sqrt((x - u_x)^2 + (y - u_y)^2). But unless we can find relations between x and y, this might not help.

Wait, but earlier, we found that SA² = 8x + 65. But SA² is also equal to x² + y², since A is at (0, 0) and S is at (x, y). So:

x² + y² = 8x + 65.

But we also have from the position of R: (x - 4)^2 + y^2 = 81. Expanding this:

x² - 8x + 16 + y² = 81 → x² + y² - 8x = 65 → x² + y² = 8x + 65, which matches the previous equation. So that checks out.

Thus, SA² = 8x + 65, which is consistent.

But how does this help us find x?

Let me think. We have SU = (8x + 49)/5. Also, SU is the distance between S and U, which is sqrt((x - u_x)^2 + (y - u_y)^2). But since U is on the circle, u_x² + u_y² = 16.

Let me expand SU²:

SU² = (x - u_x)^2 + (y - u_y)^2 = x² - 2xu_x + u_x² + y² - 2yu_y + u_y² = (x² + y²) + (u_x² + u_y²) - 2(xu_x + yu_y).

We know x² + y² = 8x + 65, and u_x² + u_y² = 16. So substituting:

SU² = (8x + 65) + 16 - 2(xu_x + yu_y) = 8x + 81 - 2(xu_x + yu_y).

But SU is also equal to (8x + 49)/5. So SU² = [(8x + 49)/5]^2.

Therefore,

[(8x + 49)/5]^2 = 8x + 81 - 2(xu_x + yu_y).

Hmm, but this introduces xu_x + yu_y, which is the dot product of vectors OS and OU, where O is the origin (point A). Let me denote vector OS as (x, y) and vector OU as (u_x, u_y). Their dot product is xu_x + yu_y = OS · OU.

But how to relate this to something else?

Alternatively, since U lies on line US, which passes through S and T. Wait, T is on line US and on the circle. So U, T, S are colinear, and T is on the circle. So T is a point on the line US that also lies on the circle. So T is the second intersection of line US with the circle. Since U is also on the circle, and S is outside, then T is the other intersection point.

So, the line US intersects the circle at U and T. So, the power of S with respect to the circle is ST * SU = 8x + 49. But we also know that ST = 5, so SU = (8x + 49)/5.

But also, SU is the distance from S to U, which we can relate to the distance from S to A and the angle between SA and SU.

Wait, but we also have another relation: since T is on the line US and on the circle, then the distance from S to T is 5, and the distance from S to U is SU. So, the points U and T are both on the circle, and the line US passes through them. So, using power of point S, we have ST * SU = 8x + 49, and ST = 5, so SU = (8x + 49)/5.

But SU can also be expressed in terms of the coordinates. However, without knowing the specific coordinates of U, this seems challenging.

Wait, but there's another piece of information: point R is on the circle, and RS = 9. Earlier, we placed R at (4, 0), and found that SA² = 8x + 65. But SA is the distance from S to A, which is sqrt(x² + y²) = sqrt(8x + 65). But how to relate this to other things?

Wait, but maybe we can use triangle SUR or something else. Let me think. We have points S, U, R. But we don't know much about UR or anything. But we know that RU = 4, since R is on the circle. Wait, no: RU is the distance from R to U, which is not necessarily 4. Wait, R is on the circle centered at A, so AR = 4, but RU is not necessarily 4. Unless U is also R, which it isn't.

Alternatively, since we have SU = (8x + 49)/5, and we know that RS = 9, and R is at (4, 0), maybe we can find another equation involving SU.

Wait, let me think of triangle SUR. We have SU, SR = 9, and UR. But UR is the distance between U and R, which is sqrt((u_x - 4)^2 + (u_y - 0)^2). Since U is on the circle, u_x² + u_y² = 16. So:

UR² = (u_x - 4)^2 + u_y² = u_x² - 8u_x + 16 + u_y² = (u_x² + u_y²) - 8u_x + 16 = 16 - 8u_x + 16 = 32 - 8u_x.

So UR² = 32 - 8u_x.

But we don't know u_x, so this might not help directly.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that T is on line US, and T is on the circle. So, if I can find the coordinates of T, then I can relate it to other points.

But this feels too vague. Let me try a different approach.

Let me recall that in the power of a point formula, we have ST * SU = 8x + 49, and ST = 5, so SU = (8x + 49)/5. Also, SU is the distance from S to U. But U is on the circle, so AU = 4. So, in triangle ASU, we have sides AU = 4, AS = sqrt(8x + 65), and SU = (8x + 49)/5. So by the Law of Cosines:

SU² = AS² + AU² - 2 * AS * AU * cos(theta), where theta is the angle between AS and AU.

But this still involves theta, which is unknown. However, maybe we can relate this to other parts.

Alternatively, using the Law of Cosines in triangle ASU:

[(8x + 49)/5]^2 = (8x + 65) + 16 - 2 * sqrt(8x + 65) * 4 * cos(theta).

But this seems too complex without knowing theta.

Wait, but we also know that T is on line US and on the circle. So, the distance from S to T is 5, and T is on the circle. So, ST = 5, and T is a point on the circle, so AT = 4. So, in triangle ATS, we have AT = 4, ST = 5, and AS is the distance from A to S, which is sqrt(8x + 65). So, applying the Law of Cosines to triangle ATS:

AT² + ST² - 2 * AT * ST * cos(angle AST) = AS².

Wait, angle at T? Let me think. Triangle ATS has sides AT = 4, ST = 5, and AS = sqrt(8x + 65). So by the Law of Cosines:

AS² = AT² + ST² - 2 * AT * ST * cos(angle AT S).

But angle at T is between AT and ST. However, without knowing the angle, this seems stuck. But maybe we can find another relation.

Alternatively, since T is on line US, and AT = 4, we can write vectorially or parametrically.

Let me parameterize line US. Let me assume that S is at some point, and U is another point on the circle. Let me denote parametrically the line US. Let me set parameter t such that when t = 0, we are at U, and t = 1, we are at S. Then, any point on line US can be expressed as U + t(S - U). The point T is somewhere on this line, and since T is on the circle, it satisfies |T - A| = 4.

But this requires knowledge of coordinates of U and S, which we don't have. However, we know that ST = 5, so the distance from S to T is 5. Let me denote the parameter t such that T divides US in some ratio. Let me say that T divides US such that UT = x, and TS = 5. So, the total length US = UT + TS = x + 5. So the ratio of UT to TS is x/5.

So, in terms of vectors, T = U + (TS / US) * (S - U) = U + (5/(x + 5))*(S - U).

But since T is on the circle, |T - A| = 4. Let me substitute T into this equation.

Let me denote vectorially: T = U + (5/(x + 5))(S - U) = ((x + 5 - 5)/ (x + 5)) U + (5/(x + 5)) S = (x/(x + 5)) U + (5/(x + 5)) S.

So, T = (x/(x + 5)) U + (5/(x + 5)) S.

Now, since T is on the circle, |T - A|² = 16. Expand this:

|T - A|² = |(x/(x + 5)) U + (5/(x + 5)) S - A|² = 16.

But A is the origin, so this simplifies to:

|(x/(x + 5)) U + (5/(x + 5)) S|² = 16.

Expanding this squared magnitude:

[x²/(x + 5)^2] |U|² + [2 * x * 5 / (x + 5)^2] U · S + [25/(x + 5)^2] |S|² = 16.

But |U|² = 16, since U is on the circle. Also, |S|² = SA² = 8x + 65. And U · S is the dot product of vectors U and S, which is U_x * S_x + U_y * S_y.

Let me denote this dot product as U · S = U_x * S_x + U_y * S_y.

So plugging in:

[x²/(x + 5)^2]*16 + [10x/(x + 5)^2]*(U · S) + [25/(x + 5)^2]*(8x + 65) = 16.

Multiply both sides by (x + 5)^2 to eliminate denominators:

16x² + 10x(U · S) + 25(8x + 65) = 16(x + 5)^2.

Expand RHS: 16(x² + 10x + 25) = 16x² + 160x + 400.

So:

16x² + 10x(U · S) + 200x + 1625 = 16x² + 160x + 400.

Subtract 16x² from both sides:

10x(U · S) + 200x + 1625 = 160x + 400.

Rearranging:

10x(U · S) + 200x + 1625 - 160x - 400 = 0 → 10x(U · S) + 40x + 1225 = 0.

Divide both sides by 5:

2x(U · S) + 8x + 245 = 0 → 2x(U · S) = -8x - 245 → U · S = (-8x - 245)/(2x).

But we also know that U · S = U_x * S_x + U_y * S_y. Is there another way to find U · S?

Wait, recall earlier that we had from SU² = 8x + 81 - 2(xu_x + yu_y). Wait, earlier, SU² was expanded as 8x + 81 - 2(xu_x + yu_y), and SU = (8x + 49)/5. So:

[(8x + 49)/5]^2 = 8x + 81 - 2(xu_x + yu_y).

But xu_x + yu_y is U · S. Let me denote that as D = U · S. So:

[(8x + 49)^2]/25 = 8x + 81 - 2D.

So rearranged:

2D = 8x + 81 - [(8x + 49)^2]/25.

But from the earlier equation derived from the circle condition, we have D = (-8x - 245)/(2x).

So substitute D into this equation:

2 * [(-8x - 245)/(2x)] = 8x + 81 - [(8x + 49)^2]/25.

Simplify left side: [-8x - 245]/x = 8x + 81 - [(8x + 49)^2]/25.

Multiply both sides by x to eliminate denominator:

-8x - 245 = x(8x + 81) - x[(8x + 49)^2]/25.

Let me expand the right side:

Right side = 8x² + 81x - [x(8x + 49)^2]/25.

This looks complex, but let me proceed step by step.

Let me denote N = 8x + 49, so N = 8x + 49. Then, the equation becomes:

-8x - 245 = 8x² + 81x - [xN²]/25.

But N = 8x + 49, so N² = (8x + 49)^2 = 64x² + 784x + 2401.

Thus:

-8x - 245 = 8x² + 81x - [x(64x² + 784x + 2401)] / 25.

Multiply both sides by 25 to eliminate denominator:

25*(-8x - 245) = 25*(8x² + 81x) - x(64x² + 784x + 2401).

Compute left side: -200x - 6125.

Right side: 200x² + 1825x - 64x³ - 784x² - 2401x.

Combine terms:

Right side = -64x³ + (200x² - 784x²) + (1825x - 2401x) = -64x³ - 584x² - 576x.

So overall equation:

-200x - 6125 = -64x³ - 584x² - 576x.

Bring all terms to one side:

64x³ + 584x² + 576x + 200x + 6125 = 0 → 64x³ + 584x² + 776x + 6125 = 0.

Hmm, this cubic equation looks very complicated. Solving this analytically might be difficult. Maybe there's a mistake in my derivations? Let me check the steps.

Starting from the equation after multiplying by 25:

Left side: -200x - 6125.

Right side: 200x² + 1825x - x(64x² + 784x + 2401).

Wait, let me verify the expansion of xN²:

N = 8x + 49 → N² = 64x² + 784x + 2401. Correct.

So xN² = x*(64x² + 784x + 2401) = 64x³ + 784x² + 2401x.

So the term -[xN²]/25 is -(64x³ + 784x² + 2401x)/25.

Then, the right side is 25*(8x² + 81x) - xN²/25 * 25? No, original equation after multiplying by 25:

Left side: -200x - 6125 = right side: 25*(8x² + 81x) - xN².

Wait, no. Original equation after multiplying by 25:

Left side: -200x - 6125.

Right side: 25*(8x² + 81x) - xN².

Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me re-express.

Original equation after multiplying by 25:

-200x - 6125 = 25*(8x² + 81x) - xN².

Where N² = (8x + 49)^2.

So expanding:

-200x - 6125 = 200x² + 1825x - x(64x² + 784x + 2401).

Then, moving everything to left side:

-200x - 6125 - 200x² - 1825x + x(64x² + 784x + 2401) = 0.

Which is:

-200x² - 200x - 1825x - 6125 + 64x³ + 784x² + 2401x = 0.

Combine like terms:

For x³: +64x³.

For x²: -200x² + 784x² = 584x².

For x: -200x - 1825x + 2401x = (-200 - 1825 + 2401)x = (2401 - 2025)x = 376x.

Constants: -6125.

So overall equation:

64x³ + 584x² + 376x - 6125 = 0.

Wait, previously I had 776x, but that was incorrect. This suggests a miscalculation earlier. Let me recalculate:

Original calculation after bringing all terms to left side:

-200x - 6125 - 200x² - 1825x + 64x³ + 784x² + 2401x = 0.

Breaking down:

x³: 64x³.

x²: -200x² + 784x² = 584x².

x terms: -200x - 1825x + 2401x = (2401 - 200 - 1825)x = (2401 - 2025)x = 376x.

Constant: -6125.

So equation: 64x³ + 584x² + 376x - 6125 = 0.

This is a cubic equation. Solving this might be challenging, but maybe there's a rational root. Let's try Rational Root Theorem. Possible rational roots are factors of 6125 divided by factors of 64.

Factors of 6125: 6125 = 5^3 * 7^2. So possible rational roots include ±1, ±5, ±7, ±25, ±35, etc., over divisors of 64.

Let me test x = 5: 64*(125) + 584*(25) + 376*5 - 6125.

Calculate:

64*125 = 8000.

584*25 = 14600.

376*5 = 1880.

Total: 8000 + 14600 + 1880 = 8000+14600=22600 + 1880=24480. Minus 6125: 24480 - 6125 = 18355 ≠ 0.

Try x = 7: 64*343 + 584*49 + 376*7 - 6125.

64*343 = 21952.

584*49 = let's calculate 584*50 = 29200 minus 584 = 28616.

376*7 = 2632.

Total: 21952 + 28616 = 50568 + 2632 = 53200 - 6125 = 47075 ≠ 0.

Not zero. Try x = 25: Probably too big. Let me try smaller numbers.

Try x = 5: Already tried, nope.

How about x = 5. Let me see. Maybe there's a decimal root. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in deriving the equation. This seems too complex, suggesting that perhaps my earlier approach is wrong.

Alternative idea: Since this seems too complex, maybe there's a simpler approach using power of a point and other relations.

Recall that we had from power of point S: ST * SU = SA² - 16 = 8x + 49.

And ST = 5, so SU = (8x + 49)/5.

Also, we have SU is the distance from S to U, and U is on the circle, so AU = 4. So, using the Law of Cosines on triangle ASU:

SU² = AS² + AU² - 2 * AS * AU * cos(theta), where theta is angle at A.

But we also have AS² = 8x + 65, AU = 4, and SU = (8x + 49)/5.

So:

[(8x + 49)/5]^2 = (8x + 65) + 16 - 2 * sqrt(8x + 65) * 4 * cos(theta).

But this still includes cos(theta). However, if I can find another expression for cos(theta), perhaps from triangle ATS.

Wait, in triangle ATS, we have AT = 4, ST = 5, and AS = sqrt(8x + 65). Applying Law of Cosines:

AS² = AT² + ST² - 2 * AT * ST * cos(angle AT S).

So:

8x + 65 = 16 + 25 - 2 * 4 * 5 * cos(angle AT S).

Which simplifies to:

8x + 65 = 41 - 40 cos(angle AT S).

Rearranged:

40 cos(angle AT S) = 41 - (8x + 65) = -8x - 24.

So:

cos(angle AT S) = (-8x - 24)/40 = (-2x - 6)/10.

Now, angle AT S is the angle at T between AT and ST. But how does this relate to angle theta in the previous equation?

Alternatively, since points A, T, S are related, maybe there's a relation between angles. However, without a clear connection, this might not help directly.

But let's note that angle AT S is supplementary to angle between AS and AT, depending on the configuration. This might not be helpful.

Alternatively, let's return to the equation from triangle ASU:

[(8x + 49)/5]^2 = (8x + 65) + 16 - 2 * sqrt(8x + 65) * 4 * cos(theta).

But if we can relate cos(theta) to something else.

Wait, in triangle ASU, theta is the angle at A between AS and AU. But we also have that U is on the line US, so the angle between AS and AU is related to the direction of line US.

However, without additional information, it's unclear.

At this point, I realize that solving this algebraically is leading to complex equations, possibly indicating an error in approach or needing numerical methods. Given that this is a multiple-choice question, maybe I can estimate x by trying the answer choices.

Let me try each option and see which one fits.

Given the answer choices are A. 9.2, B. 10.2, C. 11.2, D. 12.2.

Let me pick one, say option B: x = 10.2.

Then, let's compute SA² = 8x + 65 = 8*10.2 + 65 = 81.6 + 65 = 146.6.

Power of S is SA² - 16 = 146.6 - 16 = 130.6.

But power of S is also ST * SU = 5 * SU = 130.6 → SU = 130.6 / 5 = 26.12.

Now, in triangle ASU, we have AS = sqrt(146.6) ≈ 12.11, AU = 4, SU ≈ 26.12.

Check if these satisfy the Law of Cosines:

SU² = AS² + AU² - 2 * AS * AU * cos(theta).

So 26.12² ≈ 146.6 + 16 - 2 * 12.11 * 4 * cos(theta).

Calculate 26.12² ≈ 682.0.

Right side: 162.6 - 96.88 * cos(theta).

So 682.0 ≈ 162.6 - 96.88 * cos(theta) → 96.88 * cos(theta) ≈ 162.6 - 682.0 = -519.4 → cos(theta) ≈ -519.4 / 96.88 ≈ -5.36.

But cosine cannot be less than -1. So this is impossible. Hence, x = 10.2 is invalid.

Try option C: x = 11.2.

SA² = 8*11.2 + 65 = 89.6 + 65 = 154.6.

Power of S = 154.6 - 16 = 138.6.

SU = 138.6 / 5 = 27.72.

AS = sqrt(154.6) ≈ 12.43.

Check triangle ASU: SU ≈ 27.72, AS ≈ 12.43, AU = 4.

Law of Cosines: SU² ≈ 27.72² ≈ 768.

AS² + AU² = 154.6 + 16 = 170.6.

So 768 ≈ 170.6 - 2*12.43*4*cos(theta) → 768 ≈ 170.6 - 99.44 * cos(theta) → 99.44 * cos(theta) ≈ 170.6 - 768 = -597.4 → cos(theta) ≈ -597.4 / 99.44 ≈ -6.01. Again, invalid.

Same issue. What about option A: x = 9.2.

SA² = 8*9.2 + 65 = 73.6 + 65 = 138.6.

Power of S = 138.6 - 16 = 122.6.

SU = 122.6 / 5 = 24.52.

AS = sqrt(138.6) ≈ 11.77.

Check triangle ASU: SU ≈ 24.52, AS ≈ 11.77, AU = 4.

SU² ≈ 601.

AS² + AU² = 138.6 + 16 = 154.6.

So 601 ≈ 154.6 - 2*11.77*4*cos(theta) → 601 ≈ 154.6 - 94.16 * cos(theta) → 94.16 * cos(theta) ≈ 154.6 - 601 = -446.4 → cos(theta) ≈ -4.74. Still invalid.

Option D: x = 12.2.

SA² = 8*12.2 + 65 = 97.6 + 65 = 162.6.

Power of S = 162.6 - 16 = 146.6.

SU = 146.6 / 5 = 29.32.

AS = sqrt(162.6) ≈ 12.75.

Triangle ASU: SU ≈ 29.32, AS ≈ 12.75, AU = 4.

SU² ≈ 859.6.

AS² + AU² = 162.6 + 16 = 178.6.

So 859.6 ≈ 178.6 - 2*12.75*4*cos(theta) → 859.6 ≈ 178.6 - 102 * cos(theta) → 102 * cos(theta) ≈ 178.6 - 859.6 = -681 → cos(theta) ≈ -6.67. Still invalid.

All options give invalid cosine values, which suggests that my earlier approach is flawed.

Let me reconsider. Perhaps my assumption about the position of T is wrong. Maybe T is not between S and U, but rather on the extension of US beyond U. So, for example, S---U---T, making SU = ST - TU = 5 - x? Wait, no. If T is beyond U, then ST = SU + UT. Let me clarify.

If T is on line US, but not between S and U, then there are two possibilities: T is on the extension of SU beyond S, or beyond U.

Case 1: T is between S and U: SU = ST + TU = 5 + x.

Case 2: T is beyond U, so that S----U----T. Then, ST = SU + UT = SU + x.

But in this case, the power of S would be ST * SU = (SU + x) * SU = SU² + xSU. But this seems complex.

Wait, but earlier, I assumed that T is between S and U, leading to SU = ST + TU = 5 + x. But this led to impossible results. Perhaps the correct case is T is not between S and U, but on the other side.

Let me try this new assumption: T is beyond U, so that S---U---T, and ST = SU + UT = SU + x. Then, the power of S is ST * SU = (SU + x) * SU = SU² + xSU. But this equals SA² - 16 = 8x + 49.

But also, SU is the distance from S to U. Let me denote SU = d. Then, power of S is d(d + x) = 8x + 49.

But also, in triangle ASU, we have AS² = 8x + 65, AU = 4, and SU = d.

By Law of Cosines: d² = AS² + AU² - 2 * AS * AU * cos(theta) = (8x + 65) + 16 - 2 * sqrt(8x + 65) * 4 * cos(theta).

But this still leaves us with the same problem.

Alternatively, if I assume that T is beyond S, so that U---S---T. Then, ST = ST, and SU = ST - UT = ST - x. But this is getting too ambiguous.

Perhaps I need to revisit the power of a point formula. If T is on line US and on the circle, then the power of S is ST * SU, where SU is the length from S to U, and ST is the length from S to T. But if T is on the extension of US beyond S, then SU would be the distance from S to U, and ST would be the distance from S to T, which is greater than SU. So, in this case, the power of S would be ST * SU = (SU + UT) * SU, where UT is the distance from U to T. But UT is not given directly.

Wait, but we know that TS = 5. If T is on the line US, then TS is the distance from T to S, which is 5. So, if T is on the extension of US beyond S, then ST = 5, and SU = ? Let me define SU as the distance from S to U. Then, if T is beyond S, then ST = 5, and UT = SU + ST = SU + 5. But we don't know UT. But we are supposed to find UT = x. Wait, no: the problem says LengthOf(Line(T, S)) = 5, so TS = 5. If T is beyond S, then UT = US + ST = SU + 5. But we don't know SU.

Alternatively, if T is on the extension of US beyond U, then ST = SU + UT, and UT = x. So ST = SU + x. But TS is given as 5, so SU + x = 5 → SU = 5 - x. But SU is a length, so 5 - x > 0 → x < 5. But the answer choices are all greater than 9, so this is impossible.

Thus, the only possibility is that T is between S and U, giving SU = ST + TU = 5 + x. But earlier, this led to impossible results. Why?

Maybe there's an error in calculating SA². Let me double-check.

Earlier, I assumed that R is at (4, 0), and S is at (x, y), with RS = 9. Then, (x - 4)^2 + y^2 = 81. Also, SA² = x² + y² = 8x + 65. This comes from expanding (x - 4)^2 + y^2 = 81 → x² - 8x + 16 + y² = 81 → x² + y² = 8x + 65. This is correct.

So SA² = 8x + 65.

Power of S is SA² - 16 = 8x + 49.

But if T is between S and U, then power of S is ST * SU = 5 * SU = 8x + 49 → SU = (8x + 49)/5.

But SU is also the distance from S to U. Let me think: if I can express SU in terms of x using the Law of Cosines in triangle ASU, and equate it to (8x + 49)/5.

Let me try this again, with the corrected understanding.

In triangle ASU, we have:

AS² = 8x + 65, AU = 4, SU = (8x + 49)/5.

Law of Cosines: SU² = AS² + AU² - 2 * AS * AU * cos(theta).

So [(8x + 49)/5]^2 = (8x + 65) + 16 - 2 * sqrt(8x + 65) * 4 * cos(theta).

But I don't know theta. However, if I can relate this to another equation from triangle ATS.

In triangle ATS, we have AT = 4, ST = 5, AS = sqrt(8x + 65). Law of Cosines:

AS² = AT² + ST² - 2 * AT * ST * cos(phi), where phi is the angle at T.

So 8x + 65 = 16 + 25 - 2 * 4 * 5 * cos(phi) → 8x + 65 = 41 - 40 cos(phi) → 40 cos(phi) = 41 - (8x + 65) = -8x - 24 → cos(phi) = (-8x - 24)/40 = (-2x - 6)/10.

Now, if I can relate angle phi to angle theta, but I don't see a direct relation. However, if I assume that angles are supplementary or something, but it's uncertain.

Alternatively, let me consider that in triangle ASU and triangle ATS, there might be some relationship. For example, if I can find the relationship between the angles.

But this seems too vague. Let me try to assume that the angle phi is the same as theta, but this is not necessarily true.

Alternatively, let me try to combine the two equations.

From triangle ASU:

[(8x + 49)/5]^2 = (8x + 65) + 16 - 2 * sqrt(8x + 65) * 4 * cos(theta).

From triangle ATS:

cos(phi) = (-2x - 6)/10.

If I can relate theta and phi, but without additional info, this is not possible.

At this point, I think I need to accept that this problem requires solving the cubic equation, and perhaps the answer is among the choices, and I need to approximate.

Let me try to guess x such that the equation 64x³ + 584x² + 376x - 6125 = 0 holds.

Let me try x = 5: 64*125 + 584*25 + 376*5 - 6125 = 8000 + 14600 + 1880 - 6125 = 24480 - 6125 = 18355 > 0.

x = 4: 64*64 + 584*16 + 376*4 - 6125 = 4096 + 9344 + 1504 - 6125 = 14944 - 6125 = 8819 > 0.

x = 3: 64*27 + 584*9 + 376*3 - 6125 = 1728 + 5256 + 1128 - 6125 = 8112 - 6125 = 1987 > 0.

x = 2: 64*8 + 584*4 + 376*2 - 6125 = 512 + 2336 + 752 - 6125 = 3500 - 6125 = -2625 < 0.

So between x=2 and x=3, the function crosses zero. But our answer choices are all greater than 9, so this suggests that my earlier equation is incorrect, or there's a mistake in derivation.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption about the position of T is wrong, and the correct scenario is that T is on the extension of US beyond S, making ST = 5 and SU = ST - UT = 5 - x. But this would require x < 5, which is not in the choices. Hence, this suggests a fundamental error in my approach.

Let me try a different method. Since points U, T, R are on the circle with radius 4, and RS = 9. Let me consider triangle RST or something.

Wait, R is on the circle, T is on the circle, and S is a point such that RS = 9. So RT is a chord of the circle, and RS is a line from R to S. Maybe using the Law of Cosines on triangle RTS.

But I don't know RT. However, since T is on the circle, RT is a chord. Let me denote RT = d. Then, in triangle RST, we have RS = 9, RT = d,
