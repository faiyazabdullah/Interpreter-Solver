====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So we have triangle ABC, which is isosceles with AB congruent to BC. That means sides AB and BC are equal in length. The question asks us to find AB. 

The given information includes some expressions for the lengths of the sides in terms of x. Let me write them down:

- Length of AC is x - 3
- Length of BC is 4x - 21
- Length of AB is 2x - 7

Since the triangle is isosceles with AB ≅ BC, that tells me that AB equals BC. Wait, but AB is 2x - 7 and BC is 4x - 21. So setting those equal should give me an equation to solve for x. Let me do that first.

So set AB = BC:

2x - 7 = 4x - 21

Let me solve for x. Subtract 2x from both sides:

-7 = 2x - 21

Then add 21 to both sides:

14 = 2x

Divide by 2:

x = 7

Wait, so x is 7? Let me check if that makes sense. Let me plug x=7 back into the expressions for AB and BC.

AB would be 2*7 -7 = 14 -7 = 7.

BC would be 4*7 -21 = 28 -21 = 7. Okay, so they are equal. Good. But wait, what about AC?

AC is x - 3, so when x=7, that's 7 -3 = 4. So AC is 4. 

But hold on, since it's a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. Let me check if that holds here. 

So sides are AB=7, BC=7, AC=4. Let's check:

AB + BC > AC? 7 +7 =14 >4, yes.

AB + AC > BC? 7+4=11>7, yes.

BC + AC > AB? 7+4=11>7, same as above. So that's okay. So no issues there.

But wait, the problem says triangle ABC is isosceles with AB ≅ BC. So that's satisfied because AB and BC are both 7. So then AB is 7. Looking at the answer choices, option C is 7. So maybe the answer is C?

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't misread anything. Because sometimes there can be alternative interpretations. For example, maybe the triangle could also have another pair of equal sides? Let me think again.

In an isosceles triangle, exactly two sides are equal. Since the problem states AB ≅ BC, so AB and BC are the ones that are equal. Therefore, AC is the base. So our calculation seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another scenario where another pair of sides are equal? Let me check. Suppose instead that AB ≅ AC or BC ≅ AC? But the problem specifically says AB ≅ BC, so that's fixed. So no need to consider other cases.

Therefore, solving AB = BC gives x=7, leading to AB=7. Which is option C. 

But just to double-check, maybe there's something else. Let me see. Are there other possibilities? For instance, suppose that even though AB ≅ BC, maybe there's another condition that affects x? Or maybe my equations were wrong?

Let me re-examine the problem statement. It says "Given geometric constraints: Equals(LengthOf(Line(A, C)), x-3), Equals(LengthOf(Line(B, C)), 4x-21), Equals(LengthOf(Line(A, B)), 2x-7)." So those are the three lengths. Then the triangle is isosceles with AB ≅ BC. So AB and BC are equal, hence equate their expressions. 

Yes, that's correct. So solving gives x=7, leading to AB=7. So answer C. 

But let me check if plugging x=7 into AC gives 4, which is positive. Yes, 7-3=4. All lengths are positive. So everything checks out. 

I don't see any mistakes here. So the answer should be C, 7.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ AB $ in the isosceles triangle $ \triangle ABC $, where $ AB \cong BC $, we begin by analyzing the given algebraic expressions for the side lengths:

- $ AB = 2x - 7 $
- $ BC = 4x - 21 $
- $ AC = x - 3 $

---

### Step 1: Use the Isosceles Triangle Property

We're told that triangle $ ABC $ is isosceles with $ AB \cong BC $. This implies that:

$$
AB = BC
$$

Substitute the given expressions:

$$
2x - 7 = 4x - 21
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve for $ x $

Rearranging the equation:

$$
2x - 7 = 4x - 21 \\
\Rightarrow -7 + 21 = 4x - 2x \\
\Rightarrow 14 = 2x \\
\Rightarrow x = 7
$$

---

### Step 3: Compute $ AB $

Now substitute $ x = 7 $ into the expression for $ AB $:

$$
AB = 2x - 7 = 2(7) - 7 = 14 - 7 = 7
$$

Thus, the length of $ AB $ is **7**.

---

### Step 4: Verify Triangle Validity (Optional Check)

For completeness, compute the remaining side $ AC $ using $ x = 7 $:

$$
AC = x - 3 = 7 - 3 = 4
$$

Check the triangle inequality:

- $ AB + BC = 7 + 7 = 14 > 4 $
- $ AB + AC = 7 + 4 = 11 > 7 $
- $ BC + AC = 7 + 4 = 11 > 7 $

All conditions are satisfied, confirming the validity of the solution.

\boxed{C}
