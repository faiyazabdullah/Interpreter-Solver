MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, and C. The given information is that the length of line AC is 9 units, the length of AB is 15 units, and BC is x units. Also, it says that lines CA and CB are perpendicular. Wait, so point C is connected to both A and B, and those two lines are perpendicular. That makes me think of a right triangle. Let me visualize this.

If lines CA and CB are perpendicular, then angle at point C is a right angle. So, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at C. Therefore, sides AC and BC are the legs, and AB is the hypotenuse. But wait, hold on. Wait, AB is given as 15, which would be the hypotenuse if the right angle is at C. Because in a right triangle, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. So, if the right angle is at C, then AB would be the hypotenuse. Then, AC and BC are the legs. 

Given that AC is 9, BC is x, and AB is 15. So, using Pythagoras theorem: AC² + BC² = AB². Plugging in the numbers: 9² + x² = 15². Calculating that, 81 + x² = 225. Subtracting 81 from both sides gives x² = 225 - 81 = 144. Taking square root, x = 12. So, the answer should be 12, which is option C.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I get the right angle correctly? The problem states Perpendicular(Line(C,A), Line(C,B)). So, lines CA and CB are perpendicular. That means the angle between CA and CB is 90 degrees, which is the angle at point C. So yes, triangle ABC has a right angle at C. Therefore, AB is indeed the hypotenuse. So the calculation holds. Hence, x is 12. So the correct answer is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve for $ x $, we begin by interpreting the geometric configuration described:

- Points $ A $, $ B $, and $ C $ form triangle $ \triangle ABC $.
- It is given that $ \text{Length}(AC) = 9 $, $ \text{Length}(AB) = 15 $, and $ \text{Length}(BC) = x $.
- Additionally, it is stated that $ \overline{CA} \perp \overline{CB} $, meaning the angle at vertex $ C $ is a **right angle**.

---

### Step 1: Recognize the Triangle Type

Since $ \angle C = 90^\circ $, triangle $ \triangle ABC $ is a **right triangle**, with the right angle at $ C $. In such triangles, the **Pythagorean Theorem** applies:

$$
\text{(Hypotenuse)}^2 = \text{(Leg}_1)^2 + \text{(Leg}_2)^2
$$

Here, $ AB $ is the **hypotenuse**, and $ AC $ and $ BC $ are the **legs**.

---

### Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem

Let’s substitute known values into the equation:

$$
AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 \\
15^2 = 9^2 + x^2 \\
225 = 81 + x^2
$$

Now isolate $ x^2 $:

$$
x^2 = 225 - 81 = 144
$$

Take the square root of both sides:

$$
x = \sqrt{144} = 12
$$

---

### Final Answer

The value of $ x $ is **12**, which corresponds to **Option C**.

$$
\boxed{\text{Final Answer: C}}
$$
