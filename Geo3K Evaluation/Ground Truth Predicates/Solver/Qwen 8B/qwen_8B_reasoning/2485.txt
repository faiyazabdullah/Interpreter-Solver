MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, we have a rhombus ABCD. First, I need to recall the properties of a rhombus. All sides are equal in length, right? And opposite angles are equal. Also, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, but the question mentions points E lying on lines CA and BD. Hmm, so maybe E is the intersection point of the diagonals?

Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals intersect at the midpoint of each other. So if E is the intersection point of diagonals AC and BD, then that would make sense. But the problem says PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(C,A)) and PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(B,D)), which means E lies on both diagonals AC and BD. Therefore, E is the intersection point of the diagonals. 

But wait, the problem gives AB = 2x + 3 and BC = 5x. Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal. So AB should equal BC. Let me check that. If AB = BC, then 2x + 3 = 5x. Solving for x: subtract 2x from both sides, 3 = 3x, so x = 1. Then AB = 2(1) + 3 = 5, and BC = 5(1) = 5. Okay, that makes sense. So each side is 5 units long.

Now, we need to find the measure of angle AEB. Let me visualize the rhombus. Let me sketch mentally. Let's label the rhombus ABCD with AB, BC, CD, DA as sides. In a rh, the diagonals bisect the angles. Also, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, if E is the intersection point of the diagonals AC and BD, then AE and BE are parts of those diagonals.

So, since diagonals in a rhombus bisect each other at 90 degrees. Wait, but angle AEB would be formed at point E between segments AE and BE. But since diagonals are perpendicular, angle AEB should be 90 degrees. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. However, let me confirm.

Let me think again. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular. So, if AC and BD intersect at E, then angle AEB is 90 degrees. Because the diagonals are perpendicular. So regardless of the side lengths, as long as it's a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Hence, angle AEB would be 90 degrees. Therefore, the answer would be option C, 90 degrees. 

Wait, but why does the problem give AB and BC in terms of x? Maybe there's more to it? Wait, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me check again. The problem states that AB = 2x + 3 and BC = 5x. We found x=1 because AB equals BC in a rhombus. But does that affect the angle AEB? No, because regardless of the side lengths, the diagonals are always perpendicular. So even if the sides change, as long as it's a rhombus, diagonals are perpendicular. Therefore, angle AEB is 90 degrees. 

Alternatively, could there be another interpretation? For example, maybe E isn't the intersection of the diagonals? But according to the given constraints, E lies on line CA and line BD, so E has to be their intersection. Unless there's another point E? But in a rhombus, the only intersection of CA and BD is the center point. So E must be that center point. Thus, angle AEB is 90 degrees. So answer C. 

Wait, but maybe the problem is referring to some other triangle or configuration? Let me make sure. Suppose we consider vectors or coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to check. Let me place the rhombus in coordinate system. Let me assume point A at (0,0). Since it's a rhombus, suppose diagonals are along axes. Let me say diagonal AC is horizontal, BD vertical. Let me denote E as origin. Wait, but maybe better to use specific coordinates.

Suppose diagonals AC and BD intersect at E. Let’s say AC has length d1 and BD has length d2. Then, since diagonals bisect each other, AE = d1/2, BE = d2/2. The diagonals are perpendicular, so triangle AEB is a right triangle with legs AE and BE. Therefore, angle AEB is 90 degrees. So regardless of the lengths of AE and BE, angle AEB is right. Therefore, the answer is 90 degrees. So option C.

Therefore, the answer is C. But let me check again if there's any possible mistake here. Suppose someone might think that angle AEB depends on the sides. But no, because in a rhombus, diagonals are always perpendicular. So even if the sides are different lengths, but in our case, the sides are same. Wait, no, in a rhombus all sides are same. So the diagonals depend on the angles of the rhombus. But regardless of the angles, the diagonals are still perpendicular. So angle between them is 90 degrees. Therefore, angle AEB is 90 degrees. 

Hence, answer is C. So the correct choice is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine $ m\angle AEB $ in the rhombus $ABCD$, we begin by analyzing the key properties of a **rhombus**:

- All sides of a rhombus are equal in length.
- Opposite angles are equal.
- Diagonals bisect each other at **right angles**.
- Diagonals also bisect the vertex angles.

### Step 1: Use the Given Side Lengths

We're told:
$$
AB = 2x + 3,\quad BC = 5x
$$

Since all sides of a rhombus are equal, set $ AB = BC $:
$$
2x + 3 = 5x
$$
Subtracting $2x$ from both sides:
$$
3 = 3x \Rightarrow x = 1
$$

Plugging back into either expression:
$$
AB = 2(1) + 3 = 5,\quad BC = 5(1) = 5
$$
This confirms the rhombus property that all four sides are equal to 5 units.

---

### Step 2: Understand the Role of Point $E$

The problem specifies:
- $E$ lies on line segment $CA$
- $E$ lies on line segment $BD$

This uniquely defines $E$ as the **intersection point of the diagonals** $AC$ and $BD$. This is a defining characteristic of a rhombus — its diagonals intersect at the center and divide each other perpendicularly.

Thus, $E$ is the **center** of the rhombus, and the diagonals form **perpendicular lines** at $E$.

---

### Step 3: Determine $\angle AEB$

Because the diagonals intersect at $E$ and are **perpendicular**, the angle formed at their intersection — specifically $\angle AEB$ — is:
$$
\boxed{90^\circ}
$$

This conclusion is independent of the actual side lengths or specific dimensions of the rhombus; it follows directly from the definition of a rhombus.
