MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, and C. The problem says that the length of line AB is 33 units. Then, the length of line AC is x, which we need to find. Also, the length of BC is 66 units. Additionally, it's given that line AC is perpendicular to line AB. 

First, I should probably visualize this. Let me sketch a rough diagram in my mind. Since AC is perpendicular to AB, that means angle at point A between lines AB and AC is 90 degrees. So, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at point A. Wait, but hold on, if AB and AC are perpendicular, then yes, triangle ABC has a right angle at A. Therefore, AB and AC are the legs of the right triangle, and BC would be the hypotenuse. But wait, the length of BC is given as 66. However, AB is 33, so maybe using Pythagoras here?

Wait, let me confirm. In a right-angled triangle, the sum of squares of the legs equals the square of the hypotenuse. Here, AB and AC are the legs, and BC is the hypotenuse. So:

AB² + AC² = BC²

We know AB is 33, AC is x, and BC is 66. Plugging these values in:

33² + x² = 66²

So solving for x:

x² = 66² - 33²

Hmm, let me compute that. Remember that a² - b² factors into (a - b)(a + b). So:

66² - 33² = (66 - 33)(66 + 33) = (33)(99)

Calculating that product: 33 * 99. Well, 33*100 is 3300, subtract 33 gives 3300 - 33 = 3267. So x² = 3267.

Then x is sqrt(3267). Now, can we simplify sqrt(3267)? Let's see. Let me factor 3267. First, note that 3267 divided by 3 is 1089. Because 3*1000=3000, 3*89=267, so total 3*1089=3267. And 1089 is 33 squared, since 33^2 is 1089. So:

sqrt(3267) = sqrt(3 * 1089) = sqrt(3 * 33²) = 33 * sqrt(3). 

Therefore, x = 33√3. Looking at the answer choices, option C is 33√3. So that should be the answer. Let me check again if I made any mistake in reasoning.

Wait, another way to think: If AB is 33, BC is 66, which is double of AB. So, in a right triangle, if one leg is half the hypotenuse, then the other leg can be found via Pythagoras. Alternatively, maybe there's a property here? For example, in a right triangle, if one leg is half the hypotenuse, then the triangle is a 30-60-90 triangle? Wait, no. Wait, in a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in ratio 1 : √3 : 2. So, if hypotenuse is twice the shorter leg. Here, BC is 66, which is the hypotenuse. Suppose AB is the shorter leg, which is 33. Then the longer leg AC would be 33√3. Which matches our previous calculation. Hence, answer C.

Yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the correct answer should be C. Let me just make sure I didn't confuse the legs. Since AB and AC are the legs, and BC is hypotenuse. So AB is 33, AC is x, BC is 66. So yes, using Pythagoras gives x = sqrt(66² - 33²) = 33√3. So answer is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x = \text{LengthOf}(Line(A, C)) $, we start by interpreting the given geometric information:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Configuration**

The problem states that:

- $ \text{LengthOf}(Line(A, B)) = 33 $
- $ \text{LengthOf}(Line(B, C)) = 66 $
- $ \text{Perpendicular}(Line(A, C), Line(A, B)) $

This implies that $ \angle CAB = 90^\circ $, meaning triangle $ \triangle ABC $ is a **right triangle** with the right angle at vertex $ A $. Thus, segments $ AB $ and $ AC $ form the two legs of the right triangle, while segment $ BC $ is the hypotenuse.

---

### **Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**

In a right triangle, the relationship among the sides is given by:

$$
\text{(Leg 1)}^2 + \text{(Leg 2)}^2 = \text{(Hypotenuse)}^2
$$

Substituting known lengths:

$$
AB^2 + AC^2 = BC^2 \\
33^2 + x^2 = 66^2
$$

Now solve for $ x $:

$$
x^2 = 66^2 - 33^2
$$

Use the difference of squares formula:

$$
x^2 = (66 - 33)(66 + 33) = 33 \cdot 99
$$

Compute the product:

$$
33 \cdot 99 = 3267
$$

Take the square root:

$$
x = \sqrt{3267}
$$

Factorize $ 3267 $:

$$
3267 = 3 \cdot 1089 = 3 \cdot 33^2
$$

So,

$$
x = \sqrt{3 \cdot 33^2} = 33\sqrt{3}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Match with Given Choices**

Compare with the answer choices:

- A. $ 33 $
- B. $ 33\sqrt{2} $
- C. $ 33\sqrt{3} $
- D. $ 33\sqrt{5} $

Our derived value $ x = 33\sqrt{3} $ corresponds directly to **Choice C**.

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\text{C}}
$$

Final Answer: C
