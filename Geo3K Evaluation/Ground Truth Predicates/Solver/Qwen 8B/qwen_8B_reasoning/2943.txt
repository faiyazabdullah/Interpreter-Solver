MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So we have a parallelogram ABCD, right? The question is asking for the measure of angle AFD. Let me start by recalling some properties of parallelograms. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel, and opposite angles are equal. Also, consecutive angles are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. Plus, the diagonals bisect each other.

Wait, but the problem mentions points F which lies on both lines DB and AC. So point F is the intersection of the diagonals AC and BD in the parallelogram. Because in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, so their intersection point divides them into two equal parts. But maybe there's more here.

Let me list down all the given information:

First, the lengths:

- Length of DA is 29 units. Since it's a parallelogram, AB should be equal to CD, and AD equal to BC. Wait, but CD is given as 25? Wait, hold on. Wait, the problem says "Parallelogram ABCD". Wait, in a standard labeling of a parallelogram, the vertices are ordered such that AB is adjacent to BC, etc. So ABCD would mean that AB is connected to BC, CD, and DA. So in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. Therefore, AB equals CD, and AD equals BC.

But wait, the given data includes LengthOf(Line(D,C)) = 25. So DC is 25. Then since AB is opposite to DC, AB should also be 25. However, the problem states that LengthOf(Line(A,B)) is 5x. So that means 5x = 25, so x=5? Maybe that's useful later.

Also, LengthOf(Line(C,B)) is 3y-4. Since CB is equal to AD, which is given as 29. Therefore, 3y - 4 = 29. Solving that gives 3y = 33 => y = 11. Not sure yet if that's needed, but perhaps.

Now angles:

MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,B)) is 34 degrees. Let me visualize the parallelogram. Point A, D, B. So angle at D between points A, D, B. Wait, angle ADC? Or angle at D? Wait, the notation MeasureOf(Angle(A, D, B)) means the angle at point D between points A and B. So angle ADB?

Similarly, MeasureOf(Angle(D,C,A)) is 54 degrees. That would be angle at C between D, C, A. So angle DCA?

Then MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,D)) is 49 degrees. That's angle at A between C, A, D. So angle CAD.

Hmm. Let me try to sketch this mentally. Parallelogram ABCD. Let me recall that in a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. For example, angle at A and angle at B are supplementary. But maybe I need to use triangle properties here.

Since point F is the intersection of diagonals AC and BD. In a parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other, so AF = FC and BF = FD. Wait, no—diagonals bisect each other, so AF = FC and BF = FD. So F is the midpoint of both diagonals.

So angle AFD is formed at point F between points A, F, D. So triangle AFD. To find its measure.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinates? Let me think. Maybe coordinate geometry can help here.

Let me assign coordinates to the points. Let me place point D at the origin (0,0). Since DA is 29 units. Let me assume DA is along the x-axis. Wait, but angle at D is involved. Alternatively, maybe better to set coordinates based on known angles and lengths.

Alternatively, since we know some angles and sides, perhaps using vectors or trigonometry.

Alternatively, consider triangles involving point F. Since F is the intersection of diagonals, so in a parallelogram, diagonals split each other into halves. So AF = FC and BF = FD.

Therefore, triangle AFD has sides AF, FD, and AD. Wait, but AD is 29. Hmm. Wait, but maybe we can relate angles here.

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle AFD. We need angle at F. So maybe using the Law of Sines or Cosines in triangle AFD.

But to do that, we might need some side lengths or other angles.

Alternatively, since diagonals intersect at F, maybe looking at triangles formed by diagonals.

In a parallelogram, the diagonals divide it into four triangles. Each pair of opposite triangles are congruent.

But how does that help with angle AFD?

Alternatively, maybe look at triangle AFB and triangle DFC? Not sure.

Wait, but maybe focusing on the angles given. Let me check again.

Given angle at D between A and B is 34 degrees. So angle ADB is 34 degrees. And angle at C between D and A is 54 degrees. Which is angle DCA = 54 degrees. Also angle at A between C and D is 49 degrees, which is angle CAD = 49 degrees.

Wait, angle at A between C and D is 49 degrees. So angle CAD is part of angle A. Since in a parallelogram, angle at A is equal to angle at C, and adjacent angles are supplementary.

Wait, let me try to find the measures of the angles of the parallelogram first.

In a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So if we can find one angle, we can find others.

We have angle CAD is 49 degrees. Wait, angle CAD is part of angle A. So angle at A is composed of angle CAD and another angle? Wait, if ABCD is a parallelogram, then at vertex A, the angles are between sides AB and AD. Wait, but angle CAD is between CA and DA. So maybe angle CAD is part of angle BAD?

Yes. So angle BAD (which is angle at A) is made up of angle CAD and something else? Wait, no. If you draw diagonal AC, then angle at A is split into two angles by diagonal AC: angle CAB and angle CAD. Wait, but in our case, angle CAD is given as 49 degrees. So if we can find angle CAB, then total angle at A is sum of those two.

But how?

Alternatively, maybe using triangle ADC. Wait, angle at D is angle ADC. Wait, in the parallelogram, angle ADC is equal to angle ABC, and supplementary to angle DAB.

Wait, given angle DCA is 54 degrees. Angle DCA is part of triangle ADC. So in triangle ADC, we have angle at C is 54 degrees, angle at D is... ?

Wait, angle ADC is one of the angles of the parallelogram. Let me denote angle ADC as θ. Then angle DAB is 180° - θ, because consecutive angles are supplementary.

But in triangle ADC, the sum of angles is 180 degrees. So angle at D (ADC), angle at C (DCA = 54°), and angle at A (CAD = 49°). Wait, but angle at A in triangle ADC is angle CAD = 49°, angle at D is angle ADC = θ, and angle at C is angle DCA = 54°. Therefore:

θ + 54° + 49° = 180° ⇒ θ = 180° - 54° - 49° = 77°. Therefore, angle ADC is 77°, which is one of the angles of the parallelogram.

Therefore, angle ADC = 77°, so angle ABC = 77°, and angles at A and C are supplementary to that, so angle DAB = 180° - 77° = 103°, and same for angle BCD = 103°.

Wait, but earlier we had angle CAD = 49°, which is part of angle DAB. So angle DAB is 103°, and angle CAD is 49°, so the remaining part of angle DAB is angle CAB = 103° - 49° = 54°. So angle CAB is 54 degrees.

Now, looking back at angle ADB, which was given as 34°. That is, angle at D between A and B, i.e., angle ADB. So in triangle ABD, angle at D is 34°, angle at A is angle BAD = 103°, but wait, no. Wait, triangle ABD has vertices A, B, D. So angle at D is angle ADB = 34°, angle at A is angle BAD = 103°, and angle at B is angle ABD.

Wait, sum of angles in triangle ABD is 180°, so:

angle ADB + angle BAD + angle ABD = 180°

So 34° + 103° + angle ABD = 180° ⇒ angle ABD = 180 - 34 - 103 = 43°.

So angle ABD is 43 degrees.

But how does this help us with finding angle AFD?

Well, point F is the intersection of diagonals AC and BD. So in parallelogram ABCD, diagonals AC and BD intersect at F. Therefore, in triangle AFD, we need to find angle at F.

Alternatively, maybe using triangle AFD. Let me think about the triangles around point F.

Since diagonals bisect each other, AF = FC and BF = FD. So in triangle AFD, sides AF and DF are half of the diagonals. But without knowing the lengths of the diagonals, maybe this isn't directly helpful. But perhaps using the Law of Sines or Cosines in certain triangles.

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle AFD. Let me see if I can find some angles or sides.

Alternatively, since diagonals in a parallelogram bisect each other, then AF = (AC)/2 and DF = (BD)/2. But unless we know the lengths of diagonals, which we don't yet, maybe not immediately helpful.

Alternatively, maybe using vector approaches. Assign coordinates to points.

Let me try coordinate geometry. Let me assign coordinates to points A, B, C, D.

Let me place point D at the origin (0, 0). Since DA is length 29. Let me assume DA is along the x-axis. So point D is at (0, 0), point A is at (29, 0).

Now, need to determine coordinates of B and C. Since ABCD is a parallelogram, vector AB equals vector DC, and vector AD equals vector BC.

But first, we need to find coordinates of B and C. Let me think.

From point D (0,0) to A (29,0). Now, we need to find coordinates of B and C such that ABCD is a parallelogram.

Let me denote coordinates:

Let’s suppose point B has coordinates (p, q), and point C will be determined accordingly.

Since ABCD is a parallelogram, vector AB equals vector DC. Vector AB is B - A = (p - 29, q - 0) = (p - 29, q). Vector DC is C - D = C - (0,0) = coordinates of C. Therefore, vector DC = AB → C = (p - 29, q).

Also, since ABCD is a parallelogram, vector AD equals vector BC. Vector AD is D - A = (-29, 0). Vector BC is C - B = [(p - 29) - p, q - q] = (-29, 0). Yes, that matches.

So coordinates of C are (p - 29, q). 

Additionally, since ABCD is a parallelogram, the order of the points matters. So moving from A to B to C to D to A. So the position of point C depends on point B.

But we also have some angles given. Let me use the angles to find relations between coordinates.

First, angle at D between A and B is 34 degrees. That is, angle ADB is 34 degrees. So angle between DA and DB is 34 degrees.

Vector DA is from D to A: (29, 0). Vector DB is from D to B: (p, q). The angle between these vectors is 34 degrees.

The formula for the angle between two vectors u and v is:

cos(theta) = (u · v)/(|u| |v|)

So cos(34°) = (DA · DB) / (|DA| |DB|)

Compute DA · DB: (29)(p) + (0)(q) = 29p.

|DA| is sqrt(29² + 0²) = 29.

|DB| is sqrt(p² + q²).

Thus,

cos(34°) = 29p / (29 * sqrt(p² + q²)) ) = p / sqrt(p² + q²)

Which simplifies to:

cos(34°) = p / |DB|

So that gives us a relation between p and q.

Additionally, angle at C between D and A is 54 degrees. That is, angle DCA = 54 degrees. Let me think about that angle.

Point C is (p - 29, q). Point D is (0,0), point A is (29, 0). So angle at C between points D, C, A. So angle DCA is the angle at point C between points D, C, A.

To compute this angle, we can consider vectors CD and CA.

Vector CD is D - C = (0 - (p - 29), 0 - q) = (29 - p, -q).

Vector CA is A - C = (29 - (p - 29), 0 - q) = (29 - p + 29, -q) = (58 - p, -q).

Angle between vectors CD and CA is 54 degrees. So:

cos(54°) = (CD · CA) / (|CD| |CA| )

Compute CD · CA = (29 - p)(58 - p) + (-q)(-q) = (29 - p)(58 - p) + q².

|CD| = sqrt( (29 - p)^2 + q^2 )

|CA| = sqrt( (58 - p)^2 + q^2 )

This seems complicated, but maybe we can find relations between p and q from previous equations.

Earlier, we had from angle ADB being 34°:

cos(34°) = p / sqrt(p² + q²). Let me call this equation (1).

Also, from angle DCA = 54°, we can write equation (2):

[ (29 - p)(58 - p) + q² ] / [ sqrt( (29 - p)^2 + q^2 ) * sqrt( (58 - p)^2 + q^2 ) ) ] = cos(54°)

This looks very complex, but maybe there's another way. Let me think if there are other angles given.

We also have angle CAD = 49 degrees. This is the angle at point A between points C, A, D. So angle between vectors AC and AD.

Point A is at (29, 0). Vector AC is C - A = (p - 29 - 29, q - 0) = (p - 58, q). Vector AD is D - A = (-29, 0).

So angle between AC and AD is 49 degrees. Using dot product:

cos(49°) = (AC · AD) / (|AC| |AD| )

Compute AC · AD = (p - 58)(-29) + q*0 = -29(p - 58)

|AC| = sqrt( (p - 58)^2 + q^2 )

|AD| = 29

So:

cos(49°) = [ -29(p - 58) ] / [ 29 * sqrt( (p - 58)^2 + q^2 ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

cos(49°) = -(p - 58)/sqrt( (p - 58)^2 + q^2 )

Let me note that (p - 58) is just a scalar. Let me denote k = p - 58. Then:

cos(49°) = -k / sqrt(k² + q² )

Note that sqrt(k² + q²) is the magnitude of vector AC. So this expression implies that the cosine of 49 degrees is negative of (k divided by |AC|). Which suggests that the angle between AC and AD is 49 degrees, but depending on direction.

But since angle is measured as positive, maybe taking absolute value? Or maybe I made a sign error.

Wait, the angle between vectors AC and AD is 49 degrees. Depending on orientation, the dot product could be positive or negative. But since angle is between 0 and 180 degrees, cosine can be positive or negative.

But given that angle CAD is 49 degrees, which is acute. So the cosine should be positive. However, according to the above, it's -k / |AC|. So that would require that -k is positive, implying that k < 0, i.e., p - 58 < 0 → p < 58.

So, from this equation:

cos(49°) = - (p - 58)/sqrt( (p - 58)^2 + q^2 )

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

cos²(49°) = (p - 58)^2 / [ (p - 58)^2 + q^2 ]

Cross multiplying:

cos²(49°)[(p - 58)^2 + q^2] = (p - 58)^2

Expanding:

cos²(49°)(p - 58)^2 + cos²(49°)q² = (p - 58)^2

Rearranging terms:

[cos²(49°) - 1](p - 58)^2 + cos²(49°)q² = 0

But cos²(x) - 1 = -sin²(x), so:

-sin²(49°)(p - 58)^2 + cos²(49°)q² = 0

Which rearranges to:

cos²(49°)q² = sin²(49°)(p - 58)^2

Divide both sides by sin²(49°):

cot²(49°) q² = (p - 58)^2

Take square roots:

cot(49°) q = ± (p - 58)

But since we assumed earlier that k = p - 58 < 0, then (p - 58) is negative, and since cot(49°) is positive, then q must be negative to make the RHS negative. So:

q = - (p - 58)/cot(49°) = (58 - p)/cot(49°) = (58 - p) tan(49°)

So q = (58 - p) tan(49°)

Let me compute tan(49°). Let me approximate this value. Tan(49°) ≈ 1.1503684...

So q ≈ 1.1503684*(58 - p)

Let me keep this as equation (3): q = (58 - p) tan(49°)

Now, going back to equation (1):

cos(34°) = p / sqrt(p² + q²)

Square both sides:

cos²(34°) = p² / (p² + q²)

Multiply both sides by denominator:

cos²(34°)(p² + q²) = p²

Expand:

cos²(34°)p² + cos²(34°)q² = p²

Bring terms together:

cos²(34°)p² - p² + cos²(34°)q² = 0

Factor p²:

p² [cos²(34°) - 1] + cos²(34°)q² = 0

Again, cos²(x) - 1 = -sin²(x):

-p² sin²(34°) + cos²(34°) q² = 0

Rearrange:

cos²(34°) q² = p² sin²(34°)

Divide both sides by cos²(34°):

q² = p² tan²(34°)

Take square roots:

q = ± p tan(34°)

But earlier from equation (3), q = (58 - p) tan(49°). So combining these:

± p tan(34°) = (58 - p) tan(49°)

Assuming that the signs are consistent. Given that earlier analysis suggested q is negative (since p < 58), and tan(34°) is positive (~0.6745). So if we take the negative sign:

- p tan(34°) = (58 - p) tan(49°)

Let me write that:

- p tan(34°) = (58 - p) tan(49°)

Let me expand:

- p tan(34°) = 58 tan(49°) - p tan(49°)

Bring terms with p to left:

- p tan(34°) + p tan(49°) = 58 tan(49°)

Factor p:

p [tan(49°) - tan(34°)] = 58 tan(49°)

Thus:

p = [58 tan(49°)] / [tan(49°) - tan(34°)]

Let me compute this numerically.

First, calculate tan(49°) and tan(34°):

tan(49°) ≈ 1.1503684

tan(34°) ≈ 0.6745085

So denominator: 1.1503684 - 0.6745085 ≈ 0.4758599

Numerator: 58 * 1.1503684 ≈ 58 * 1.1503684 ≈ let's calculate:

58 * 1 = 58, 58 * 0.1503684 ≈ 58 * 0.15 = 8.7, plus 58 * 0.0003684 ≈ ~0.0214. Total approx 58 + 8.7 + 0.0214 ≈ 66.7214

So approximately 66.7214.

Thus, p ≈ 66.7214 / 0.4758599 ≈ let's divide:

Approximately 66.72 / 0.4759 ≈ let me compute 66.72 / 0.4759.

Dividing 66.72 ÷ 0.4759:

≈ 66.72 / 0.4759 ≈ multiply numerator and denominator by 1000: 66720 / 475.9 ≈ roughly 66720 ÷ 475.9 ≈ approx 140. Approximately 140. Let me check with calculator steps:

Well, 0.4759 × 140 = 0.4759 × 100 + 0.4759 × 40 = 47.59 + 19.036 = 66.626. Which is close to 66.72. So p ≈ 140. So approximately 140. Let me check exact value:

If 0.4759 × 140 = ~66.626, and our numerator is ~66.72, difference is 66.72 - 66.626 = 0.094. So additional amount is 0.094 / 0.4759 ≈ 0.197. So total p ≈ 140.197. Let me say p ≈ 140.2.

So p ≈ 140.2.

Then, from equation (3): q = - p tan(34°). Wait, earlier we took the negative sign. Wait, earlier when solving for q, we had q = - p tan(34°)? Let me check.

From equation (1), after squaring and deriving, we had q = ± p tan(34°). Earlier, we considered that q is negative, so q = - p tan(34°). So yes.

So q = - p tan(34°) ≈ -140.2 * 0.6745 ≈ -140.2 * 0.6745 ≈ let me compute:

First, 140 * 0.6745 = 94.43

Then 0.2 * 0.6745 ≈ 0.1349

Total ≈ - (94.43 + 0.1349) ≈ -94.5649. So q ≈ -94.565.

So coordinates of point B are (p, q) ≈ (140.2, -94.565). 

Now, coordinates of point C are (p - 29, q) = (140.2 - 29, -94.565) ≈ (111.2, -94.565).

Now, we can proceed to find coordinates of point F, which is the intersection of diagonals AC and BD.

Diagonal AC connects A(29, 0) and C(111.2, -94.565). Diagonal BD connects B(140.2, -94.565) and D(0, 0).

We need to find the intersection point F of AC and BD.

Parametrize both lines.

For line AC: parametric equations. Let parameter t vary from 0 to 1.

x = 29 + t*(111.2 - 29) = 29 + t*(82.2)

y = 0 + t*(-94.565 - 0) = -94.565t

For line BD: parametric equations. Let parameter s vary from 0 to 1.

x = 0 + s*(140.2 - 0) = 140.2s

y = -94.565 + s*(0 - (-94.565)) = -94.565 + 94.565s

Find t and s where these meet:

Set x and y equal:

29 + 82.2t = 140.2s ...(i)

-94.565t = -94.565 + 94.565s ...(ii)

From equation (ii):

Divide both sides by -94.565:

t = 1 - s

Substitute into equation (i):

29 + 82.2(1 - s) = 140.2s

Expand:

29 + 82.2 - 82.2s = 140.2s

Combine like terms:

29 + 82.2 = 111.2

So:

111.2 = 140.2s + 82.2s = 222.2s

Therefore, s = 111.2 / 222.2 ≈ 0.5.

So s = 0.5, hence t = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

Therefore, point F is at:

From line AC: x = 29 + 82.2 * 0.5 = 29 + 41.1 = 70.1; y = -94.565 * 0.5 ≈ -47.2825.

Alternatively, from line BD: x = 140.2 * 0.5 = 70.1; y = -94.565 + 94.565 * 0.5 = -94.565 + 47.2825 ≈ -47.2825. So coordinates of F are approximately (70.1, -47.2825).

Now, we need to find angle AFD. That is, the angle at point F between points A, F, D.

Points:

A is (29, 0)

F is (70.1, -47.2825)

D is (0, 0)

So vectors FA and FD.

Vector FA is A - F = (29 - 70.1, 0 - (-47.2825)) = (-41.1, 47.2825)

Vector FD is D - F = (0 - 70.1, 0 - (-47.2825)) = (-70.1, 47.2825)

We need the angle between vectors FA and FD at point F.

The angle between vectors FA and FD can be found using the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (FA · FD) / (|FA| |FD| )

First compute FA · FD:

(-41.1)(-70.1) + (47.2825)(47.2825)

Calculate:

First term: 41.1 * 70.1 ≈ let's compute 41 * 70 = 2870, plus 41 * 0.1 = 4.1, plus 0.1 * 70 = 7, plus 0.1 * 0.1 = 0.01. So total approx 2870 + 4.1 + 7 + 0.01 ≈ 2881.11. More accurately, 41.1 * 70.1 = ?

Alternatively, use calculator-like approximation:

41.1 * 70.1 = 41.1*(70 + 0.1) = 41.1*70 + 41.1*0.1 = 2877 + 4.11 = 2881.11

Second term: (47.2825)^2. Let me approximate 47.28^2. Well, 47^2 = 2209, 0.28^2 = 0.0784, cross term 2*47*0.28 = 26.32. So total (a+b)^2 = 2209 + 26.32 + 0.0784 ≈ 2235.3984. But actual value may differ slightly. Let me take it as approximately 2235.4.

So FA · FD ≈ 2881.11 + 2235.4 ≈ 5116.51

Now compute |FA| and |FD|.

|FA| = sqrt( (-41.1)^2 + (47.2825)^2 ) = sqrt( (approx 1689.21) + 2235.4 ) ≈ sqrt(3924.61) ≈ 62.65

Similarly, |FD| = sqrt( (-70.1)^2 + (47.2825)^2 ) = sqrt( 4914.01 + 2235.4 ) ≈ sqrt(7149.41) ≈ 84.56

So cos(theta) ≈ 5116.51 / (62.65 * 84.56) ≈ 5116.51 / (5300.7) ≈ approx 0.965.

So theta ≈ arccos(0.965). What's arccos(0.965)?

Well, cos(15°) ≈ 0.9659, so 0.965 is very close to 15 degrees. Hence, angle theta ≈ 15 degrees. Wait, but the answer choices don't include 15. The options are 3, 34, 49, 97. Wait, but this calculation suggests around 15 degrees. However, none of the options match. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe my approximated values introduced errors. Let me check again.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler approach using triangle properties rather than coordinates.

Wait, earlier we found that angle at A is 103 degrees, angle at D is 77 degrees, etc.

But since F is the intersection of diagonals, in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, and they form vertical angles. Also, the diagonals divide the parallelogram into four triangles. The key property might be that the angle between the diagonals relates to the angles of the parallelogram.

Alternatively, using the fact that in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, so triangle AFD is formed. Let me consider triangle AFD. Points A, F, D.

We need angle at F. Perhaps using the fact that in triangle AFD, we can find angles via known angles.

Alternatively, since diagonals in a parallelogram satisfy the formula:

In general, the angle between diagonals can be related to the angles of the parallelogram. But I'm not sure of the exact relationship.

Alternatively, consider triangle AFD. Let me think about the angles in triangle AFD. At point F, angle AFD. Let me think about other angles.

At point F, which is the intersection of diagonals AC and BD. So in parallelogram ABCD, diagonals intersect at F. So AF is half of AC, DF is half of BD.

But maybe using the law of sines in triangle AFD. Let me attempt that.

In triangle AFD, we need angle at F. Let me denote angle AFD as θ.

Other angles in triangle AFD: at A, angle FAD, and at D, angle FDA.

We can find those angles if we know some relations.

Angle FAD is part of angle DAB. Earlier, we found that angle DAB is 103 degrees. Since diagonal AC splits angle DAB into two angles: angle FAD and angle CAB. Earlier, we found that angle CAB is 54 degrees (from earlier calculation where angle at A was 103 degrees, and angle CAD was 49 degrees, so CAB = 103 - 49 = 54 degrees). Wait, no. Wait, angle at A is DAB = 103 degrees. When we draw diagonal AC, it splits angle DAB into angle between DA and AC (which is angle CAD = 49 degrees) and angle between AC and AB (which is angle CAB = 103 - 49 = 54 degrees). So angle FAD is angle between FA and DA. Wait, no. Wait, point F is on AC, so angle FAD is the same as angle CAD, which is 49 degrees. Wait, no. Wait, angle at A in triangle AFD is angle FAD, which is the angle between FA and DA. Since FA is part of diagonal AC, and DA is the side. So angle FAD is indeed angle CAD = 49 degrees.

Similarly, angle FDA is the angle at D between FD and DA. Let me think about that. FD is part of diagonal BD. At point D, angle between FD and DA. Original angle at D is angle ADC = 77 degrees. Diagonal BD splits this angle into two angles: angle ADB and angle CDB. Earlier, we were told that angle ADB is 34 degrees. So angle ADB = 34 degrees. Thus, angle FDA is part of this. Wait, at point D, angle between FD (which is part of BD) and DA is angle ADB = 34 degrees. So angle FDA is 34 degrees.

Wait, in triangle AFD, angles at A and D are 49° and 34° respectively. Therefore, the third angle at F is 180° - 49° - 34° = 97°.

Ah! So angle AFD is 97 degrees. Which matches option D.

Wait, why didn't the coordinate method give this? Probably due to approximation errors in the coordinate calculation. My approximate calculation gave around 15 degrees, but that must have been incorrect due to rounding errors during manual computation. The precise analytical approach shows that angle AFD = 180 - 49 - 34 = 97 degrees.

So the correct answer is D. 97 degrees.

Let me verify this conclusion. In triangle AFD, angles at A and D are 49° and 34°, thus angle at F is 180 - 49 - 34 = 97°, which is answer D.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**

In a **parallelogram**, the following properties apply:
- Opposite sides are equal and parallel.
- Opposite angles are equal.
- Consecutive angles are supplementary (i.e., they sum to $180^\circ$).
- The diagonals bisect each other, meaning they intersect at their midpoints.

The problem provides specific angles and lengths:
- $ \angle ADB = 34^\circ $
- $ \angle DCA = 54^\circ $
- $ \angle CAD = 49^\circ $

From this, we can deduce several things:
- Triangle $ \triangle ADC $ contains angles $ \angle DCA = 54^\circ $, $ \angle CAD = 49^\circ $, and therefore the third angle $ \angle ADC = 180^\circ - 54^\circ - 49^\circ = 77^\circ $.
- Since $ \angle ADC = 77^\circ $, the opposite angle $ \angle ABC = 77^\circ $, and the adjacent angles $ \angle DAB $ and $ \angle BCD $ are $ 180^\circ - 77^\circ = 103^\circ $.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze Triangle AFD**

Point $F$ is the intersection of diagonals $AC$ and $BD$. From the properties of parallelograms, diagonals bisect each other, so point $F$ is the midpoint of both diagonals. Thus:
- Segment $AF$ is half of diagonal $AC$
- Segment $DF$ is half of diagonal $BD$

We now focus on triangle $AFD$, where:
- $ \angle FAD = \angle CAD = 49^\circ $ (because $F$ lies on diagonal $AC$)
- $ \angle FDA = \angle ADB = 34^\circ $ (because $F$ lies on diagonal $BD$)

Using the triangle angle sum property:
$$
\angle AFD = 180^\circ - \angle FAD - \angle FDA = 180^\circ - 49^\circ - 34^\circ = 97^\circ
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

Based on the geometric configuration and angle relationships in triangle $AFD$, the measure of $ \angle AFD $ is:
$$
\boxed{97}
$$

**Final Answer:**  
$\boxed{\text{D}}$
