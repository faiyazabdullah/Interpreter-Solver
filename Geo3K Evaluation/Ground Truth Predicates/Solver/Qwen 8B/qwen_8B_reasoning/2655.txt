MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, C, D with some given constraints. Let me list them again:

First, the length of line AB is 13. Then, angle at point B (angle ABC) is y degrees. The length of AD is x. Also, BC equals AD, so BC = x. Then, AD equals AC, so AC = x as well. And AC equals BD, meaning BD is also x. Additionally, DA is perpendicular to DB. Wait, that means lines DA and DB form a right angle at point D? Because Perpendicular(Line(D,A), Line(D,B)) implies that DA ⊥ DB. 

So, let me visualize this. Maybe drawing a diagram would help. But since I can't draw, I'll try to imagine it. Points A, B, C, D. Let's note down all these equal lengths and perpendicularity.

Starting with AB = 13. Then, AD = BC = AC = BD. Also, DA is perpendicular to DB. Hmm. Since DA is perpendicular to DB, triangle ADB is a right-angled triangle at D. So, in triangle ADB, right-angled at D, with legs DA and DB, both of length x. Therefore, hypotenuse AB should be sqrt(x² + x²) = x√2. But wait, AB is given as 13. Therefore, x√2 = 13 → x = 13 / √2. But maybe I need to rationalize that, but perhaps exact value isn't necessary yet.

But then there's more. AC = x, which is same as AD. Also, BC = x. And AC = BD. So BD is x. Wait, BD is another leg of triangle ADB, which is x. So BD = x, DA = x, AB = x√2. So that's consistent.

Now, looking at other parts. We need to find angle ABC, which is angle at B between points A, B, C. So angle ABC. How do I relate this?

Let me think about coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to points might help. Let me place point D at the origin for simplicity. Since DA is perpendicular to DB, and assuming D is at (0,0). Let me set up coordinate system such that D is at (0,0). Since DA and DB are perpendicular, let me take DA along the x-axis and DB along the y-axis. Wait, but DA is from D to A, and DB is from D to B. If they're perpendicular, then vectors DA and DB are perpendicular.

So, suppose point D is at (0,0). Let me assign coordinates:

Point D: (0,0)

Since DA has length x, and let me assume DA is along positive x-axis. So point A would be at (x, 0).

Similarly, since DB is perpendicular to DA, it would be along positive y-axis. So point B is at (0, x).

Wait, but then AB would be the distance between A (x, 0) and B (0, x). Which is sqrt((x)^2 + (-x)^2) = sqrt(2x²) = x√2. Which matches earlier conclusion. And since AB is given as 13, then x√2 = 13 ⇒ x = 13/√2. Okay.

Now, we need to find coordinates of point C. Given that BC = x, AC = x, and BD = x. Also, AC = BD = x. Wait, BD is already x because BD was part of the right triangle. Wait, BD is from D(0,0) to B(0,x), so its length is x. So BD = x. Then AC is also x. So AC = x. Point A is at (x,0). So point C is somewhere such that distance from A to C is x. Also, BC = x. So point C lies on intersection of two circles: circle centered at A with radius x, and circle centered at B with radius x.

Also, we have AC = BD = x, which is already considered. Now, what else? Also, AC equals BD, which is x. Wait, BD is already x. So AC is x. So that gives us the location of point C.

But how to determine coordinates of C? Let me write equations. Coordinates of A: (x, 0), coordinates of B: (0, x). Let me denote coordinates of C as (p, q). Then:

Distance from A to C: sqrt[(p - x)^2 + (q - 0)^2] = x ⇒ (p - x)^2 + q^2 = x² → expanding (p² - 2xp + x²) + q² = x² ⇒ p² - 2xp + q² = 0.

Distance from B to C: sqrt[(p - 0)^2 + (q - x)^2] = x ⇒ p² + (q - x)^2 = x² ⇒ expanding p² + q² - 2qx + x² = x² ⇒ p² + q² - 2qx = 0.

So now we have two equations:

1. p² - 2xp + q² = 0

2. p² + q² - 2qx = 0

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2:

(p² + q² - 2qx) - (p² - 2xp + q²) ) = 0 - 0 ⇒

(-2qx) - (-2xp) = 0 ⇒ -2qx + 2xp = 0 ⇒ 2x(p - q) = 0.

Assuming x ≠ 0 (since AB is 13, which is non-zero), then p - q = 0 ⇒ p = q.

So substituting back into equation 1: p² - 2xp + p² = 0 ⇒ 2p² - 2xp = 0 ⇒ 2p(p - x) = 0 ⇒ p=0 or p=x.

If p=0, then from p=q, q=0. So point C would be (0,0), which is point D. But that can't be, because then BC would be distance from B(0,x) to D(0,0): x units, which is okay, but AC would be distance from A(x,0) to D(0,0): x units. However, then C coincides with D. But the problem probably assumes distinct points, unless specified otherwise. Alternatively, p=x. Then p=x, so q=x. So point C is (x, x). Let me check that.

If C is (x, x):

Distance AC: from (x,0) to (x,x) is sqrt(0 + x²) = x. Correct.

Distance BC: from (0,x) to (x,x) is sqrt(x² + 0) = x. Correct. So that works. So point C is (x, x). Alternatively, if p=0, then q=0, but that's point D, but maybe that's another solution? But in that case, point C would coincide with D, which may not make sense here. Unless allowed. But since the problem mentions points A, B, C, D, likely distinct. So taking C as (x, x).

Therefore, coordinates:

A: (x, 0)

B: (0, x)

C: (x, x)

D: (0, 0)

Wait, but then what about the other condition? The problem says Equals(LengthOf(Line(A, C)), LengthOf(Line(B, D))). Wait, BD is from B to D, which is length x. AC is from A to C, which is x. So that checks out. So that's satisfied.

Now, we need to compute angle ABC, which is the angle at point B between points A, B, C. So angle ABC is the angle between BA and BC.

Let me find coordinates of vectors BA and BC.

Point B is at (0, x). Vector BA goes from B to A: A - B = (x - 0, 0 - x) = (x, -x).

Vector BC goes from B to C: C - B = (x - 0, x - x) = (x, 0).

So angle between vectors BA (x, -x) and BC (x, 0). To find angle between these two vectors.

The formula for angle θ between vectors u and v is cosθ = (u · v)/(|u| |v|).

Compute the dot product:

u · v = (x)(x) + (-x)(0) = x² + 0 = x².

|u| is sqrt(x² + (-x)^2) = sqrt(2x²) = x√2.

|v| is sqrt(x² + 0²) = x.

Thus, cosθ = x² / (x√2 * x) ) = x² / (x²√2) ) = 1/√2.

Therefore, θ = arccos(1/√2) = 45°, since cos(45°) = √2/2 ≈ 0.7071, which is 1/√2.

Therefore, angle ABC is 45 degrees. Hence, y = 45°, so answer is B.

Wait, but let me double-check everything. Did I get the vectors right?

Vector BA is from B to A: yes, A - B. Vector BC is from B to C: C - B. Yes. The calculation seems correct. The dot product is x², magnitudes are x√2 and x, leading to 1/√2. Thus angle is 45 degrees. So answer B.

Alternatively, could there be another configuration? For example, if point C were at (0,0), but then angle ABC... Well, if C were D, then BC would be BD, which is x, but then angle ABC would be angle between BA and BD. Let me check that scenario. Suppose C is D (0,0). Then vector BC would be D - B = (0 - 0, 0 - x) = (0, -x). Vector BA is still (x, -x). Then angle between BA (x,-x) and BD (0,-x). Let me calculate that angle. The dot product is (x)(0) + (-x)(-x) = x². |BA| is x√2, |BD| is x. So cosθ = x²/(x√2 * x) = 1/√2 again. So angle would still be 45 degrees. But in this case, point C coincides with D, but maybe the problem allows that. However, in that case, the problem statement says "Line(A,C)" which would be AD. But in the problem, it's stated that Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,D)), LengthOf(Line(A,C))), so AC = AD. If C is D, then AC is AD, which holds. But then, the angle ABC would be same as angle ABD. But regardless, even in that case, the angle is 45 degrees. So either way, whether C is at (x,x) or at D, angle ABC is 45 degrees. But in the first case, when C is at (x,x), the angle is 45 degrees. In the second case, same. So answer is B. Hence, the correct answer is B. 45 degrees.

Another way to see: In the coordinate system, when C is (x,x), then triangle ABC has coordinates A(x,0), B(0,x), C(x,x). So plotting those points, BA is going from B(0,x) to A(x,0), which is a diagonal line, and BC is from B(0,x) to C(x,x), which is horizontal to the right. The angle between BA and BC is indeed 45 degrees. Because BA has slope (0 - x)/(x - 0) = -1, so it makes 45 degrees below the horizontal. Whereas BC is horizontal. So the angle between BA (which is going down at 45 degrees from B) and BC (horizontal to the right) is 45 degrees. That confirms the angle is 45 degrees.

Hence, the answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the given geometric constraints:

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Constraints**

We are given several relationships among segments and angles:

- $ \text{Length}(AB) = 13 $
- $ \angle ABC = y $
- $ \text{Length}(AD) = x $
- $ \text{Length}(BC) = x $
- $ \text{Length}(AC) = x $
- $ \text{Length}(BD) = x $
- $ \overline{DA} \perp \overline{DB} $

From these, we observe that:

- Triangle $ \triangle ADB $ is a right triangle with legs $ AD $ and $ DB $, each of length $ x $, and hypotenuse $ AB $.  
- Using Pythagoras:  
  $$
  AB = \sqrt{x^2 + x^2} = x\sqrt{2}
  $$
  Since $ AB = 13 $, we solve for $ x $:
  $$
  x\sqrt{2} = 13 \Rightarrow x = \frac{13}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{13\sqrt{2}}{2}
  $$

---

### **Step 2: Coordinate System Setup**

To simplify computations, we assign coordinates based on the perpendicularity of $ DA $ and $ DB $:

- Place point $ D $ at the origin: $ D = (0, 0) $
- Since $ DA \perp DB $, align:
  - $ A = (x, 0) $
  - $ B = (0, x) $

This satisfies the perpendicular condition, and the segment lengths are consistent.

Now, we determine the position of point $ C $ using the constraint $ AC = BC = x $.

Let $ C = (p, q) $. From the distances:

- Distance from $ A $ to $ C $:  
  $$
  \sqrt{(p - x)^2 + q^2} = x \Rightarrow (p - x)^2 + q^2 = x^2
  $$
- Distance from $ B $ to $ C $:  
  $$
  \sqrt{p^2 + (q - x)^2} = x \Rightarrow p^2 + (q - x)^2 = x^2
  $$

Expanding both equations:

1. $ (p - x)^2 + q^2 = x^2 \Rightarrow p^2 - 2xp + x^2 + q^2 = x^2 \Rightarrow p^2 - 2xp + q^2 = 0 $
2. $ p^2 + (q - x)^2 = x^2 \Rightarrow p^2 + q^2 - 2xq + x^2 = x^2 \Rightarrow p^2 + q^2 - 2xq = 0 $

Subtracting (1) from (2):
$$
(p^2 + q^2 - 2xq) - (p^2 - 2xp + q^2) = 0 \Rightarrow -2xq + 2xp = 0 \Rightarrow x(p - q) = 0
$$

Since $ x \neq 0 $, we conclude:
$$
p = q
$$

Plugging into Equation (1):  
$$
p^2 - 2xp + p^2 = 0 \Rightarrow 2p^2 - 2xp = 0 \Rightarrow p(p - x) = 0
$$

Solutions: $ p = 0 $ or $ p = x $. If $ p = 0 $, then $ q = 0 $, which places $ C $ at $ D $ — but this would collapse multiple points, so we discard it. Thus, $ p = x $, $ q = x $, giving:
$$
C = (x, x)
$$

---

### **Step 3: Finding Angle $ \angle ABC $**

We now compute $ \angle ABC $, i.e., the angle at point $ B $ formed by vectors $ \vec{BA} $ and $ \vec{BC} $.

- $ \vec{BA} = A - B = (x, 0) - (0, x) = (x, -x) $
- $ \vec{BC} = C - B = (x, x) - (0, x) = (x, 0) $

Using the **dot product** to find the angle $ \theta $ between vectors:
$$
\cos(\theta) = \frac{\vec{BA} \cdot \vec{BC}}{|\vec{BA}| |\vec{BC}|}
$$

Compute:
- Dot product:  
  $$
  \vec{BA} \cdot \vec{BC} = x \cdot x + (-x) \cdot 0 = x^2
  $$
- Magnitudes:  
  $$
  |\vec{BA}| = \sqrt{x^2 + (-x)^2} = \sqrt{2x^2} = x\sqrt{2}, \quad |\vec{BC}| = \sqrt{x^2 + 0^2} = x
  $$

Then:
$$
\cos(\theta) = \frac{x^2}{x\sqrt{2} \cdot x} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\Rightarrow \theta = \arccos\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = 45^\circ
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

The angle $ \angle ABC = 45^\circ $, so the correct answer is:

$$
\boxed{B}
$$

---

**Final Answer: B**
