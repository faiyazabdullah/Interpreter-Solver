QUESTION:
Find x.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out how to find x here. So, we have some geometric constraints. Let me start by listing them out again to make sure I don't miss anything.

First, they say that the length of line CB is equal to y, and also equal to x. Wait, so LengthOf(Line(C,B)) equals y and also equals x? That means x and y are equal? Or maybe there's a typo? Wait, no, looking back:

The problem says:

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(C, B)), y)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(C, D)), 16)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(D, B)), 8)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(C, B)), x)

So that means both x and y are equal to the length of CB. Therefore, x = y. But maybe that's just telling us that x is equal to y, but we need to find x based on other information.

Also, there's a perpendicularity condition: Perpendicular(Line(B,C), Line(B,D)). So lines BC and BD are perpendicular. So angle at point B between points C and D is 90 degrees.

Let me visualize this. Points B, C, D. At point B, lines BC and BD are perpendicular. So triangle CBD is a right triangle with right angle at B. Wait, but BD is 8 units long, CD is 16 units? Wait, no. Wait, the lengths given are:

Line(C,D) has length 16. So CD = 16.

Line(D,B) has length 8. So DB = 8.

And Line(C,B) has length x (and y). So CB = x.

Since BC and BD are perpendicular, then triangle CBD is a right triangle with legs BC and BD, and hypotenuse CD. Wait, because in a right triangle, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. Since the right angle is at B, then CD would be the hypotenuse.

Therefore, by Pythagoras theorem:

CB² + BD² = CD²

Plugging in the known values:

x² + 8² = 16²

So x² + 64 = 256

Subtracting 64 from both sides:

x² = 256 - 64 = 192

Then x = sqrt(192). Simplify sqrt(192):

192 factors into 64 * 3. Because 64*3=192. So sqrt(64*3)=8*sqrt(3).

Wait, so x is 8√3. Looking at the answer choices, option D is 8√3. So that would be the answer?

But wait, let me check again. Did I get the triangle right?

Points C, B, D. The right angle is at B. So the two legs are BC and BD. Then CD is the hypotenuse. Yes. So yes, Pythagorean theorem applies here. So calculation seems correct. So x squared plus 8 squared equals 16 squared. Which gives x squared as 192. Square root of 192 is indeed 8√3. So answer D.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in identifying which sides are which. For example, could CD be a leg instead? No, because the right angle is at B, so the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle, meaning it connects the two legs. So CD connects points C and D, which are the endpoints of the legs BC and BD. So yes, CD is the hypotenuse. Therefore, my calculation holds.

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Suppose coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to verify.

Let’s place point B at the origin (0,0). Since BC and BD are perpendicular, let's take BC along the x-axis and BD along the y-axis.

So point B is (0,0). Let’s say point C is (x, 0) since BC has length x. Point D is (0, 8) because BD has length 8. Then CD is the distance between (x, 0) and (0, 8). Using distance formula:

CD^2 = (x - 0)^2 + (0 - 8)^2 = x² + 64. And CD is given as 16, so:

x² + 64 = 256 → x² = 192 → x = √192 = 8√3. Same result. So that confirms it. Therefore, answer D.

Looking at the choices, D is 8√3. So the answer should be D. Wait, but let me check if there's any possible mistake here. Is there any chance that the triangle isn't right-angled at B? The problem states that lines BC and BD are perpendicular. So yes, that makes the right angle at B. So the triangle CBD is right-angled at B. So everything checks out.

Another way: If someone thought that maybe the triangle was not right-angled, but the problem says Perpendicular(Line(B,C), Line(B,D)), so those two lines are perpendicular. Hence, the angle between them is 90 degrees. So triangle CBD is right-angled at B. All steps seem correct.

Hence, x is 8√3, which is option D. So Final Answer: D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration described in the problem.

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Setup**

We're told:

- $ \text{Length}(CB) = x $
- $ \text{Length}(CD) = 16 $
- $ \text{Length}(BD) = 8 $
- Lines $ CB $ and $ BD $ are **perpendicular**.

This tells us that triangle $ CBD $ is a **right triangle**, with the right angle at vertex $ B $. Thus, side $ CD $ is the **hypotenuse**, while sides $ CB $ and $ BD $ are the **legs** of the triangle.

---

### **Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**

In a right triangle, the relationship between the sides is governed by the Pythagorean Theorem:

$$
\text{(Leg}_1)^2 + \text{(Leg}_2)^2 = \text{(Hypotenuse)}^2
$$

Applying this to our triangle:

$$
CB^2 + BD^2 = CD^2
$$

Substitute the known values:

$$
x^2 + 8^2 = 16^2
$$

$$
x^2 + 64 = 256
$$

$$
x^2 = 256 - 64 = 192
$$

$$
x = \sqrt{192}
$$

Now simplify the square root:

$$
\sqrt{192} = \sqrt{64 \cdot 3} = 8\sqrt{3}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Match with Answer Choices**

From the given answer choices:

- A. $ 2\sqrt{3} $
- B. $ 4\sqrt{3} $
- C. $ 6\sqrt{3} $
- D. $ 8\sqrt{3} $

Our computed value is $ x = 8\sqrt{3} $, which matches **option D**.

### **Final Answer**

$$
\boxed{\text{D}}
$$

Final Answer: D
