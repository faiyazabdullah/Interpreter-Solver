MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have triangle ABC with some given angles and sides. Let me try to visualize it first. 

The problem states that angle at point B (angle ABC) is 60 degrees. Then, the length of BC is 'a', AC is 'b', AB is 'c', which is given as 5. Also, there's another angle mentioned: angle at point A (angle CAB) is 30 degrees? Wait, no—wait, the notation might be different. Wait, the measure of angle(C, A, B) is 30. That would mean angle at point A between points C and B. Wait, angle CAB is at point A, right? Because angle(C, A, B) means vertex at A, so yes, angle at A is 30 degrees. 

Wait, but then we also have that line CA is perpendicular to line CB. Wait, hold on. The Perpendicular(Line(C, A), Line(C, B))—so lines CA and CB are perpendicular? Wait, but if those two lines meet at point C, then they form a right angle at point C. So triangle ABC has a right angle at C? But wait, angle at C? Wait, but earlier we had angles at B and A. Let me check again.

So the given constraints:

- Measure of angle at B (ABC) is 60 degrees.

- Length BC is a.

- Length AC is b.

- Measure of angle at A (CAB) is 30 degrees? Wait, angle(C, A, B) is angle at A between points C and B. So angle CAB is 30 degrees. So angle at A is 30°, angle at B is 60°, and since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, the remaining angle at C should be 90°, because 30 + 60 + x = 180 → x=90°. Therefore, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at point C. Wait, but that contradicts the Perpendicular condition. Wait, the problem says that lines CA and CB are perpendicular. Wait, if lines CA and CB are perpendicular, then they meet at point C and form a right angle there. Therefore, angle at C is 90°, making triangle ABC a right-angled triangle at C. 

But according to the angles given, angle at A is 30°, angle at B is 60°, so angle at C is 90°, which matches. So triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at C, with angles 30°, 60°, 90°, and hypotenuse AB. Since AB is given as c = 5. We need to find the length of AC, which is side b.

In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. Specifically, the side opposite 30° is the shortest leg, then the side opposite 60° is longer leg, and the hypotenuse is twice the shorter leg.

Let me label the triangle properly. In triangle ABC, right-angled at C. So:

- Angle at C: 90°, so sides AC and BC are legs, AB is hypotenuse.

- Angle at A: 30°, so the side opposite angle A is BC. Wait, angle A is 30°, so the side opposite angle A is BC. Let me recall: in triangle ABC, angle A is 30°, so side opposite is BC. Similarly, angle B is 60°, so side opposite is AC. And hypotenuse AB.

Therefore:

- BC (opposite angle A, 30°): length a.

- AC (opposite angle B, 60°): length b.

- Hypotenuse AB: length c = 5.

In a standard 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are:

Shorter leg (opposite 30°) = x,

Longer leg (opposite 60°) = x√3,

Hypotenuse = 2x.

Here, the shorter leg is BC (opposite 30°), which is a. The longer leg is AC (opposite 60°), which is b. Hypotenuse AB is 2x, where x is the shorter leg.

Given that AB = c = 5, so 2x = 5 ⇒ x = 5/2 = 2.5. Therefore, the shorter leg BC is x = 2.5, and longer leg AC is x√3 = 2.5√3. Hence, b = 2.5√3. Looking at the answer choices, option D is 2.5√3. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I mixed up the sides?

Alternatively, using trigonometric ratios. For example, in triangle ABC:

Angle at A is 30°, angle at B is 60°, right angle at C.

Then, sin(angle A) = opposite / hypotenuse. So sin(30°) = BC / AB. Which is (a)/5. Since sin(30°)=1/2, so a/5 = 1/2 ⇒ a = 5*(1/2) = 2.5. Then, cos(angle A) = adjacent / hypotenuse. Adjacent to angle A is AC (since angle A is at A, adjacent sides are AC and AB). Wait, maybe better to use tan(angle A) = opposite / adjacent. So tan(30°) = BC / AC. Which is a/b. Since tan(30°) = 1/√3. Thus:

a / b = 1 / √3 ⇒ b = a * √3. Since a = 2.5, then b = 2.5√3. Yep, same result. So answer D.

Alternatively, using Pythagoras. If AB = 5, and AC = b, BC = a. Then a² + b² = c². But since we know the angles, we can relate them. Alternatively, knowing that in a 30-60-90 triangle, sides are in ratio 1 : √3 : 2. So hypotenuse is twice the shorter leg. Here, hypotenuse is AB = 5, so shorter leg is 2.5, longer leg is 2.5√3. Hence, AC (longer leg) is 2.5√3. So answer D.

Thus, the correct answer is D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the given geometric constraints and identifying the relationships among the elements of triangle $ ABC $. The key information includes:

- $ \angle ABC = 60^\circ $
- $ \angle CAB = 30^\circ $
- $ \angle ACB = 90^\circ $ (implied by the perpendicularity of lines $ CA $ and $ CB $)
- $ AB = c = 5 $

From these, triangle $ ABC $ is confirmed to be a **right triangle** with angles $ 30^\circ $, $ 60^\circ $, and $ 90^\circ $. This makes it a **special 30-60-90 triangle**, where the side lengths follow a fixed ratio:

$$
\text{Side Opposite } 30^\circ : \text{Side Opposite } 60^\circ : \text{Hypotenuse} = 1 : \sqrt{3} : 2
$$

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

#### 1. Labeling the Triangle
- Right angle at $ C $, so $ \angle ACB = 90^\circ $
- Side $ AB $ is the hypotenuse, with $ AB = c = 5 $
- Side $ BC $ lies opposite $ \angle CAB = 30^\circ $, so it is the **shorter leg**
- Side $ AC $ lies opposite $ \angle ABC = 60^\circ $, so it is the **longer leg**

#### 2. Using the 30-60-90 Ratio
Since the hypotenuse $ AB = 5 $, and the hypotenuse corresponds to the largest value in the ratio (which is $ 2x $):

$$
2x = 5 \Rightarrow x = \frac{5}{2}
$$

Now, the longer leg $ AC $ is:

$$
AC = x\sqrt{3} = \left(\frac{5}{2}\right)\sqrt{3} = 2.5\sqrt{3}
$$

This gives us the length of side $ AC $, denoted as $ b $, which is the quantity we were asked to find.

### Final Result

Comparing our result with the answer choices:

- A. $ \sqrt{3} $
- B. $ 1.5\sqrt{3} $
- C. $ 2\sqrt{3} $
- D. $ 2.5\sqrt{3} $

Our computed value matches **option D**.
