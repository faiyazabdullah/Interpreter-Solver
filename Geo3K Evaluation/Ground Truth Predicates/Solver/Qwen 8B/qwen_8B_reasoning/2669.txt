MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have some points and lines with certain constraints. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that angle at point E between points A, E, D is equal to x. So, Angle(A, E, D) means the angle formed at point E by the points A, E, D. So, that's ∠AED, right? And that measure is x.

Then there are two conditions:

1. Point E lies on line CD. So, E is somewhere along the line connecting points C and D. That might mean that line CD passes through E.

2. The lines AE and EC are perpendicular. Wait, the wording is Perpendicular(Line(A,E), Line(E,C)). Wait, Line(A,E) is the same as line EA, and Line(E,C) is line EC. So, these two lines are perpendicular. Therefore, AE ⊥ EC. So, at point E, lines AE and EC form a right angle.

Let me visualize this. Let me sketch a rough diagram mentally. Points C, D, E are colinear because E is on line CD. Then, there's another point A such that line AE is connected to E, and line EC is connected to E. Also, AE and EC are perpendicular. So, at point E, AE meets EC at a right angle. 

So, if I imagine point E on line CD, then line AE is perpendicular to line EC. So, line EC is part of line CD (since E is on CD). Therefore, line AE is perpendicular to line CD. Because line EC is just a segment of CD. So, AE is perpendicular to CD at point E.

Now, the angle we need to find is ∠AED. Let me think about triangle AED. Wait, but maybe it's better to consider triangle AEC first?

Wait, since AE is perpendicular to EC, which is part of CD, so triangle AEC is a right-angled triangle at E. So, in triangle AEC, angle at E is 90 degrees. But how does that relate to angle AED?

Point D is on line CD. Since E is on CD, then D is another point on line CD. So, depending on the position of D relative to E and C, the angle AED could vary. Wait, but maybe there's more information here.

Wait, angle AED is the angle at E between points A, E, D. So, that would be the angle between lines EA and ED. Now, since E is on line CD, ED is a segment from E to D, which is along line CD. So, ED is part of line CD. But line AE is perpendicular to line CD (since AE is perpendicular to EC, which is on CD). Therefore, line AE is perpendicular to line CD. Therefore, line AE is perpendicular to ED as well, since ED is along CD.

Therefore, angle between AE and ED is 90 degrees. Wait, but angle AED is that angle. Wait, no. Wait, angle AED is at E between A-E-D. So, that would be the angle between EA and ED. Since EA is perpendicular to ED (because ED is along CD and AE is perpendicular to CD), then angle AED is 90 degrees. So, x = 90 degrees. Therefore, the answer should be B. 90.

But wait, let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake here.

Let me rephrase. Since AE is perpendicular to EC, and EC is part of line CD. Therefore, AE is perpendicular to line CD. So, ED is also part of line CD. Therefore, AE is perpendicular to ED. Therefore, angle between AE and ED is 90 degrees. Hence, angle AED is 90 degrees. Therefore, x is 90. So answer B.

Alternatively, perhaps there's something else. For example, maybe D is positioned such that ED is in a different direction. But since E is on line CD, then ED is just a segment extending from E along CD. So regardless of where D is, as long as E is on CD, then ED is along CD. Thus, AE is perpendicular to CD, hence AE is perpendicular to ED. Therefore, angle AED is 90 degrees. So x=90. Therefore, answer B.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x = \text{MeasureOf}(\angle AED) $, we begin by interpreting the given geometric constraints systematically:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Setup**

We are told:

- **Point Lying On Line**:  
  $ E $ lies on the line $ CD $. This implies that points $ C $, $ E $, and $ D $ are collinear, with $ E $ being somewhere between them or possibly extended beyond.

- **Perpendicular Lines**:  
  $ \overline{AE} \perp \overline{EC} $, meaning the segments $ AE $ and $ EC $ meet at a right angle at point $ E $.

From this, we can infer that:
- Segment $ EC $ lies on the straight line $ CD $, and therefore, $ \overline{AE} $ is **perpendicular** to the entire line $ CD $, including any ray extending from $ E $—such as $ ED $.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze the Triangle Formed**

Since $ \overline{AE} \perp \overline{EC} $, and both $ \overline{EC} $ and $ \overline{ED} $ lie on the same line $ CD $, we conclude that:
- $ \overline{AE} \perp \overline{ED} $

This means that the angle between vectors $ \vec{EA} $ and $ \vec{ED} $, i.e., $ \angle AED $, is a right angle.

---

### **Step 3: Conclude the Value of $ x $**

Thus, the angle $ \angle AED $ measures $ 90^\circ $, since it is formed between two lines that are perpendicular. Therefore,

$$
x = 90^\circ
$$

---

### **Final Answer**
Final Answer: B
