====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So we have circle O, and points E and C are endpoints of a diameter, as well as A and B. Also, there's some angles mentioned involving points D and F. The question is asking for the measure of arc AC. 

First, I need to visualize this. Since E and C are diameters, that means line EC passes through the center O. Similarly, AB is another diameter. So both EC and AB are straight lines passing through O. Also, it says that angle BO D is congruent to angle D O E, which is congruent to angle E O F, which is congruent to angle F O A. Hmm, so these four angles are all equal. Let me note that down.

Since all those angles are congruent, they must each be equal. Let me think about how these points are arranged around the circle. The circle has several points labeled: A, B, C, D, E, F. And since E and C are endpoints of a diameter, so are A and B. Also, F and D might be points on the circle such that when you connect them to O, the angles between certain lines are equal.

Wait, the angles mentioned are ∠BO D, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, ∠FOA. These angles are at point O, right? Because the notation is angle BOD, meaning vertex at O. So each of these angles is formed by two radii. For example, ∠BO D would be between OB and OD. Then ∠DOE is between OD and OE. Then ∠EOF is between OE and OF, and ∠FOA is between OF and OA. All these angles are congruent. 

So starting from point B, going through D, then E, then F, then A. Each adjacent pair forms an angle at O that's equal. Since there are four angles here, each of equal measure, adding up to... Well, what's the total around point O?

The full circle around point O is 360 degrees. But these angles are part of that. Wait, but how many angles are there? There are four angles listed: BOD, DOE, EOF, FOA. That's four angles. If each is congruent, their measures add up to the total angle around O. However, depending on the positions of these points, maybe they cover parts of the circle. 

But wait, let me check again. The angles are between OB and OD (BOD), then between OD and OE (DOE), then between OE and OF (EOF), then between OF and OA (FOA). So starting from OB, moving through D, E, F, and ending at OA. Therefore, the sum of these four angles is the total angle from OB to OA via D, E, F. But since the entire circle is 360°, the sum of all angles around O is 360°, but these four angles may not necessarily cover the entire circle unless they are consecutive.

Alternatively, perhaps these angles are adjacent and together make up a portion of the circle. Let me think. Suppose each of these angles is x degrees. Then 4x = total measure of these angles. However, depending on the direction of rotation, maybe they add up to something less than 360°. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's tricky. However, considering that E and C are endpoints of a diameter, same with A and B. So points A and B are opposite each other, as are E and C. 

Let me try to sketch mentally. Let's assume that the circle is divided into arcs by points A, B, C, D, E, F. Given that EC and AB are diameters. So if I imagine the circle with center O, points E and C directly opposite each other. Similarly, A and B are also opposite. Now, points D and F are somewhere else. 

Given that angles BOD, DOE, EOF, FOA are all congruent. Let me consider the positions of D and F. Starting from point B, moving towards D, then to E, then to F, then to A. Each time, the angle between those lines is equal. So if each angle is x, then the total from B to A via D, E, F is 4x. But since AB is a diameter, the arc BA is 180 degrees. Wait, but depending on the path taken from B to A, the arc length could vary. 

Alternatively, maybe the points D and F divide the circle into specific arcs. Let me think step by step.

First, since AB is a diameter, points A and B are 180 degrees apart. Similarly, E and C are 180 degrees apart. Now, the angles given involve points D and F. Let me try to find the relationship between these points.

If angle BOD is equal to angle DOE, etc., then each angle is equal. Let me denote each angle as θ. So:

∠BO D = ∠DOE = ∠EOF = ∠FOA = θ.

Therefore, the total angle from OB to OA through D, E, F is 4θ. But since OA and OB are endpoints of a diameter, the arc from B to A along that path should be half the circle, i.e., 180 degrees. Wait, but depending on the direction. If we go from B to D to E to F to A, then the total central angle would be 4θ. Therefore, 4θ equals the central angle corresponding to arc BA, which is 180 degrees. Hence, 4θ = 180° → θ = 45°. 

Wait, but that seems possible. Let me confirm. If each angle is 45°, then the total from B to A via D, E, F would be 4*45=180°, which matches the fact that AB is a diameter. Therefore, θ is 45°, so each angle is 45 degrees. 

Now, the question asks for the measure of arc AC. Points A and C are endpoints of different diameters. Let me recall that E and C are endpoints of a diameter. So EC is a diameter, so points E and C are opposite each other. Similarly, AB is a diameter. So points A and B are opposite each other. 

We need to find the measure of arc AC. To do this, I need to determine the central angle corresponding to arc AC, which is ∠AOC. 

To find ∠AOC, I need to figure out the positions of points A and C relative to each other. Let me try to reconstruct the positions based on the given angles.

Starting from point B, moving through D, E, F, and reaching A. Each angle between those lines is 45°, as established earlier. Let me try to map out the positions.

Assume standard position for simplicity. Let me place point B at coordinates (1,0) on the unit circle. Then, since AB is a diameter, point A would be at (-1,0). Now, the angle between OB and OD is 45°, so point D is located 45° counterclockwise from OB. Wait, but direction matters. Depending on whether the angles are measured clockwise or counterclockwise. 

But since the problem mentions angles like ∠BO D, ∠DOE, etc., the order of the letters indicates the direction. For instance, ∠BO D is formed by points B, O, D. So the angle is between OB and OD. Assuming the usual orientation, if we move from B to D, then to E, etc., the direction is important.

Let me assume that the points are ordered in the counterclockwise direction. So starting from B, moving counterclockwise, we encounter D, then E, then F, then A. 

If that's the case, then:

- From B to D is 45°, because ∠BO D is 45°.
- From D to E is another 45°, making ∠DOE = 45°.
- From E to F is another 45°, ∠EOF = 45°.
- From F to A is another 45°, ∠FOA = 45°.

Thus, starting at B, moving counterclockwise 45° gets us to D, then another 45° to E, then another 45° to F, then another 45° to A. Therefore, the total movement from B to A is 4*45°=180°, which makes sense because AB is a diameter. 

So point A is located 180° counterclockwise from B. Let me confirm with coordinates. If B is at angle 0°, then A is at 180°. Then, moving counterclockwise from B (which is at 0°):

- Point D is at 0° + 45° = 45°.
- Point E is at 45° + 45° = 90°.
- Point F is at 90° + 45° = 135°.
- Then, moving another 45° from F (at 135°) brings us to A at 135° + 45° = 180°, which matches. 

So point E is at 90°, which is the top of the circle. Since EC is a diameter, point C is directly opposite E. Since E is at 90°, then C is at 90° + 180° = 270°, which is the bottom of the circle. 

Now, point A is at 180°, and point C is at 270°. We need to find the measure of arc AC. Arc AC can be measured in two ways: the minor arc or major arc. But typically, unless specified, it refers to the smaller arc. However, since the question didn't specify, but given that E and C are endpoints of a diameter, and A is at 180°, let's compute the central angle between A (180°) and C (270°).

The central angle between A (180°) and C (270°) is |270° - 180°| = 90°. So the measure of arc AC is 90°, which corresponds to option B. 

Wait, but let me verify once more. Alternatively, if the arc goes the other way, from A to C through the other side, that would be 360° - 90° = 270°, but since arcs are usually considered the shorter one unless stated otherwise, so 90° is the measure. 

But let me check if my assumption about the positions is correct. 

Another approach: Since E is at 90°, which is the top, and C is its opposite, at 270°. Point A is at 180°, which is leftmost point. So connecting A (left) to C (bottom) would create an arc that spans from 180° to 270°, which is indeed 90 degrees. So yes, the arc AC is 90°, so the measure is 90°, which is option B. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me check if there's another possibility. What if the points are arranged differently? For example, suppose the angles are measured in the other direction. Suppose instead of going counterclockwise from B to D to E to F to A, maybe it's clockwise? Let me see. 

If the angles were measured clockwise, starting from B, then ∠BO D would be clockwise, so point D would be 45° clockwise from B. But then proceeding clockwise, from D to E would be another 45°, etc. But in that case, the total from B to A would still be 180°, but the positions would be different. However, regardless of direction, the arc AC would still depend on the positions. 

However, given that EC is a diameter, and AB is another diameter. Let me consider another scenario. Suppose E is at 90°, C at 270°, as before. If point A is at 180°, then the arc AC is 90°, but if point A was at some other location... Wait no, according to our previous reasoning, point A is at 180°, as AB is a diameter. So regardless of the direction of the angles, the key is that the arc from A to C is 90°, hence the answer is 90°, which is option B. 

Alternatively, let me think again. Suppose the angles are placed such that after point F, we reach A. In our first scenario, point F is at 135°, then moving another 45° to A at 180°. So the points are arranged as follows:

- B at 0°, 
- D at 45°,
- E at 90°,
- F at 135°,
- A at 180°.

Then, point C is opposite E (since EC is a diameter), so E is at 90°, so C is at 90° + 180° = 270°. 

So arc AC goes from A (180°) to C (270°). The central angle between them is 270° - 180° = 90°, so the arc measure is 90°, so answer is B. 

Therefore, the correct answer is B, 90°.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the geometric setup and applying key concepts related to circles, diameters, and central angles.

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Setup**

We are told:

- $ \odot O $ is a circle centered at point $ O $.
- $ EC $ and $ AB $ are diameters of the circle. This implies:
  - $ E $ and $ C $ lie on opposite ends of the circle (they are endpoints of a diameter).
  - $ A $ and $ B $ also lie on opposite ends of the circle.
- Angles $ \angle BOD $, $ \angle DOE $, $ \angle EOF $, and $ \angle FOA $ are all congruent.

From this, we know that the central angles formed by these segments are equal. Since the sum of all central angles around point $ O $ is $ 360^\circ $, and we're given four congruent angles, each must be:

$$
\theta = \frac{360^\circ}{4} = 90^\circ
$$

This tells us that the points $ B \rightarrow D \rightarrow E \rightarrow F \rightarrow A $ are spaced equally around the circle, forming four equal $ 90^\circ $ angles.

---

### **Step 2: Assigning Positions Based on Central Angles**

Assuming a standard coordinate system with the circle centered at the origin $ O $, and placing point $ B $ at $ 0^\circ $, the rest of the points can be determined by rotating $ 90^\circ $ increments counterclockwise:

- $ \angle BOD = 90^\circ \Rightarrow D $ lies at $ 45^\circ $
- $ \angle DOE = 90^\circ \Rightarrow E $ lies at $ 90^\circ $
- $ \angle EOF = 90^\circ \Rightarrow F $ lies at $ 135^\circ $
- $ \angle FOA = 90^\circ \Rightarrow A $ lies at $ 180^\circ $

Hence, the points are arranged as:
- $ B = 0^\circ $
- $ D = 45^\circ $
- $ E = 90^\circ $
- $ F = 135^\circ $
- $ A = 180^\circ $

Additionally, since $ EC $ is a diameter, and $ E $ is at $ 90^\circ $, point $ C $ must be directly opposite $ E $. Thus:

$$
C = 90^\circ + 180^\circ = 270^\circ
$$

---

### **Step 3: Finding the Measure of Arc $ \overset{\frown}{AC} $**

Arc $ \overset{\frown}{AC} $ corresponds to the central angle $ \angle AOC $. Using the coordinates of points $ A $ and $ C $:

- $ A $ is at $ 180^\circ $
- $ C $ is at $ 270^\circ $

The central angle between them is:

$$
\angle AOC = |270^\circ - 180^\circ| = 90^\circ
$$

Thus, the measure of arc $ \overset{\frown}{AC} $ is:

$$
\boxed{90}
$$
