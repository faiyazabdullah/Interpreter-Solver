MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, C with some constraints. Let me list them again:

- The length of line AC is x. Wait, but we need to find y, which is the length of BC. Hmm. Also, angle at point C between points B, C, A is 60 degrees. And AB is 14 units long. Also, lines AB and AC are perpendicular. 

Wait, so AB is perpendicular to AC. That means that triangle ABC has a right angle at A? Because AB and AC are perpendicular. Wait, no. If AB and AC are perpendicular, then they form a right angle at point A. So, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at A. But there's also an angle at C which is 60 degrees. Wait, hold on. Let me visualize this.

Let me sketch mentally. Points A, B, C. AB is perpendicular to AC. So, AB ⊥ AC. Therefore, angle at A is 90 degrees. Then, angle at C is given as 60 degrees. So, in triangle ABC, angles are at A (right angle), at C (60 degrees), so the remaining angle at B would be 180 - 90 - 60 = 30 degrees. So triangle ABC is a 30-60-90 triangle?

But wait, in a standard 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. Let me recall: the side opposite 30° is the shortest, then opposite 60° is √3 times that, and hypotenuse is twice the shortest side.

In our case, angle at A is 90°, angle at C is 60°, so angle at B is 30°. Therefore, the sides opposite these angles:

- Side opposite angle A (which is BC) would be the hypotenuse? Wait, no. Wait, in triangle ABC, each angle corresponds to the opposite side.

So, angle at A is 90°, so the side opposite angle A is BC. Therefore, BC is the hypotenuse. Then, angle at B is 30°, so the side opposite angle B is AC. Angle at C is 60°, so the side opposite angle C is AB.

Therefore, in terms of ratios:

AB is opposite angle C (60°). AC is opposite angle B (30°). BC is opposite angle A (90°).

So, in a standard 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are:

Opposite 30°: shortest leg = 1

Opposite 60°: longer leg = √3

Hypotenuse = 2

Therefore, in our case:

AB (opposite 60°) is equal to √3 times the shorter leg (AC). And hypotenuse BC is twice the shorter leg.

Alternatively, maybe I should assign variables based on the given information.

Given that AB = 14. Since AB is opposite the 60° angle (angle at C), then AB corresponds to the longer leg (√3 * shorter leg). Let me denote:

Let’s call AC = x (given). Then, since angle at B is 30°, AC is opposite angle B (30°), so it's the shorter leg. Then AB is opposite angle C (60°), so it's the longer leg.

Thus, AB = AC * tan(60°)? Wait, maybe using trigonometric ratios here.

Alternatively, in a right triangle, for angle B (30°):

tan(angle B) = opposite / adjacent. So, angle B is 30°, the opposite side is AC, and adjacent is AB?

Wait, angle at B is 30°, so looking at triangle ABC, angle at B. The sides relative to angle B:

Opposite side is AC.

Adjacent side is BC? No, wait. Wait, in triangle ABC, angle at B. The sides are:

- Opposite angle B: AC

- Adjacent to angle B: AB and BC? Wait, perhaps better to use the definitions.

In triangle ABC, angle at B. So, the sides:

- Opposite angle B: AC

- Adjacent to angle B: AB and BC? Or maybe AB is adjacent?

Wait, perhaps using sine and cosine.

Since angle at B is 30°, and AB is given as 14. Let me think.

Alternatively, since it's a right triangle at A, we can use Pythagoras theorem and trigonometry.

Let me denote:

Right angle at A. So AB and AC are legs, BC is hypotenuse.

Then, angle at C is 60°, so angle between BC and AC is 60°.

So, in triangle ABC, angle at C is 60°, so tan(angle C) = opposite / adjacent. Which would be tan(60°) = AB / AC.

Because angle at C: the opposite side is AB (since angle at C is between AC and BC; so when considering angle at C, the opposite side is AB. The adjacent side is AC.

Yes, because in angle C, the two sides forming the angle are AC and BC. Therefore, the opposite side to angle C is AB.

So tan(60°) = AB / AC => tan(60°) = AB / AC.

We know tan(60°) is √3. Therefore,

√3 = AB / AC → AB = AC * √3.

But AB is given as 14, so:

14 = AC * √3 → AC = 14 / √3.

Rationalizing the denominator, that's (14√3)/3. So AC = x = 14√3 / 3. However, the question asks for y, which is the length of BC.

Since it's a right triangle, BC can be found via Pythagoras:

BC² = AB² + AC².

Plugging in AB = 14, AC = 14√3/3.

Compute BC²:

= 14² + (14√3 / 3)^2

First compute 14² = 196.

Second term: (14√3 / 3)^2 = (14^2)*(3)/(3^2) = 196*3 / 9 = 196/3.

So total BC² = 196 + 196/3 = (196*3 + 196)/3 = 196*(3 + 1)/3 = 196*4/3.

Therefore, BC = sqrt(196*4/3) = (14*2)/√3 = 28 / √3. Rationalize denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by √3:

28√3 / 3. So y = 28√3 / 3.

Looking at the answer choices, option B is 28√3 / 3. Therefore, the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me check another way. Alternatively, in a 30-60-90 triangle, hypotenuse is twice the shorter leg. Here, which is the shorter leg?

The shorter leg is opposite the smaller angle. The angles are 30°, 60°, 90°. The smallest angle is 30°, which is at B. So the side opposite angle B is AC, which is the shorter leg. Then, hypotenuse BC is twice that. So BC = 2*AC.

Earlier, we had AC = 14 / √3, so BC = 2*(14 / √3) = 28 / √3 = 28√3 / 3. Same result. So yes, that matches. Hence, answer is B.

Another approach: Using the Law of Sines. In triangle ABC, angles are 90°, 60°, 30°. So Law of Sines says:

AB / sin(angle C) = BC / sin(angle A) = AC / sin(angle B)

Angle A is 90°, angle B is 30°, angle C is 60°.

So AB / sin(60°) = BC / sin(90°) = AC / sin(30°)

Given AB = 14. So:

14 / sin(60°) = BC / 1 → BC = 14 / sin(60°)

Sin(60°) is √3 / 2, so BC = 14 / (√3 / 2 ) = 14 * 2 / √3 = 28 / √3 = same as before, 28√3 / 3. Yep, same answer. So definitely answer B.

So the correct answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ y = \text{LengthOf}(Line(B, C)) $, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration described in the problem.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**

From the problem statement, we are told:

- $ \angle BCA = 60^\circ $
- $ \perp(\text{Line}(A, B), \text{Line}(A, C)) $, meaning $ AB \perp AC $
- $ \text{LengthOf}(\text{Line}(A, B)) = 14 $

This implies that triangle $ ABC $ is a **right triangle** with a right angle at vertex $ A $, since $ AB \perp AC $. Furthermore, the angle at vertex $ C $ is $ 60^\circ $, making the third angle at vertex $ B $ equal to $ 30^\circ $ (since the sum of angles in a triangle is $ 180^\circ $). Thus, triangle $ ABC $ is a **30–60–90 triangle**, a special right triangle with known side-length ratios.

---

### **Step 2: Use Properties of a 30–60–90 Triangle**

In a 30–60–90 triangle:

- The side opposite the **30° angle** is the **shortest leg**
- The side opposite the **60° angle** is the **longer leg**
- The **hypotenuse** is twice the shortest leg

Assigning the triangle vertices accordingly:

- Right angle at $ A $
- $ \angle C = 60^\circ $, so $ AB $ is opposite this angle → longer leg
- $ \angle B = 30^\circ $, so $ AC $ is opposite this angle → shorter leg
- $ BC $ is the hypotenuse

Given that $ AB = 14 $, and $ AB $ is the longer leg (opposite the 60° angle), we relate it to the shorter leg $ AC $ as follows:

$$
\text{Longer Leg} = \text{Shorter Leg} \cdot \sqrt{3}
$$
$$
AB = AC \cdot \sqrt{3}
\Rightarrow AC = \frac{AB}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{14}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{14\sqrt{3}}{3}
$$

Now, to find the hypotenuse $ BC $, which is the side opposite the right angle:

$$
BC = 2 \times \text{Shorter Leg} = 2 \times AC = 2 \times \frac{14\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{28\sqrt{3}}{3}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Final Answer**

Thus, the value of $ y = \text{LengthOf}(\text{Line}(B, C)) = BC = \frac{28\sqrt{3}}{3} $

---

### **Final Answer: B**

$$
\boxed{\text{Final Answer: B}}
$$
