MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have several angles labeled as angle 1, 2, 3, 4, and some points with specific relationships. The goal is to find the measure of angle 3. Let me start by breaking down the information given.

First, let's list out all the given constraints:

1. Angle at W between T and Z (Angle(W, T, Z)) equals angle 4.
2. Angle at Z between W and T (Angle(Z, W, T)) equals angle 3.
3. Angle at X between W and Y (Angle(X, W, Y)) equals angle 2.
4. Angle at Z between T and Y (Angle(Z, T, Y)) equals angle 1.
5. The measure of angle at T between Y and Z (Angle(T, Y, Z)) is 52 degrees.
6. The measure of angle at Y between Z and X (Angle(Z, Y, X)) is 38 degrees.
7. Point Z lies on line YW. So, Z is somewhere along the line connecting Y and W.
8. Lines WT and WX are perpendicular. So, those two lines form a right angle at point W.
9. Lines TZ and ZY are perpendicular. So, at point Z, lines TZ and ZY meet at a right angle.
10. Lines YT and YX are perpendicular. At point Y, lines YT and YX meet at a right angle.
11. Lines XW and XY are perpendicular. Wait, that seems conflicting? Because if XW and XY are both connected to point X, but maybe there's a typo here? Wait, original says Perpendicular(Line(X,W), Line(X,Y))? That would mean that at point X, lines XW and XY are perpendicular. But then also, earlier it said that YT and YX are perpendicular. Hmm, need to make sure I parse these correctly.

Let me sketch this mentally. Maybe drawing a diagram would help, but since I can't draw, I'll try to imagine coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to the points based on the constraints.

Starting with point W. Since multiple lines are perpendicular at different points. Let me consider coordinate system.

Let me assume point W is at origin (0,0). Then, because Line(W,T) is perpendicular to Line(W,X). So, if W is at (0,0), then lines WT and WX are perpendicular. Let me suppose that line WX is along x-axis, so point X is somewhere along positive x-axis. Then line WT would be vertical, since it's perpendicular to WX. So, point T would be along y-axis. Wait, but then line YT is involved. Also, point Z lies on line YW. Let me see.

Wait, first, let's note that there are multiple right angles. Let me think about each perpendicularity condition.

First, Perpendicular(Line(W, T), Line(W, X)): So at point W, lines WT and WX are perpendicular. So, they form a right angle. So, if I take W as origin, then perhaps WT is vertical and WX horizontal, or vice versa.

Then, Perpendicular(Line(T,Z), Line(Z,Y)): At point Z, lines TZ and ZY are perpendicular. So, triangle TZ Y has a right angle at Z.

Also, Perpendicular(Line(Y,T), Line(Y,X)): At point Y, lines YT and YX are perpendicular. So, similar to above.

And Perpendicular(Line(X,W), Line(X,Y)): At point X, lines XW and XY are perpendicular. So, at point X, lines going to W and Y are perpendicular. Therefore, XW is one direction, XY is another direction, forming a right angle.

Hmm. This is getting complex. Maybe assigning coordinates will help.

Let me try to set up coordinates step by step.

Let me fix point W at (0,0).

Since Line(W, T) is perpendicular to Line(W, X). Let me assume that line WX is along the x-axis, so point X is (a, 0) for some a > 0. Then line WT is perpendicular to WX, so it would be vertical. So, point T would lie somewhere along the y-axis. Let me denote T as (0, b) for some b.

Now, line YW: since point Z lies on line YW. Let me think about point Y. We have line YT which is involved in perpendicularity with line YX. Also, line YX is part of the perpendicularity at Y.

But first, let me handle the other conditions. Also, there's Perpendicular(Line(X,W), Line(X,Y)). So, at point X, lines XW and XY are perpendicular. Since XW goes from X to W, which is along the x-axis from X(a,0) to W(0,0). So vector XW is (-a, 0). Then line XY must be perpendicular to that. So, line XY should be vertical? Because if XW is horizontal, then XY must be vertical. Therefore, from point X(a,0), moving vertically upwards or downwards. Let me assume upwards for simplicity. So, point Y would be (a, c) for some c. Wait, but then line YX is vertical. But line YT is supposed to be perpendicular to YX. Since YX is vertical, then YT must be horizontal. So, line YT is horizontal. Therefore, point T must be horizontally aligned with Y. Since Y is (a,c), then line YT being horizontal implies that T has same y-coordinate as Y. Wait, but earlier I thought T was at (0,b). So unless b = c, but that might not necessarily hold. Let me check again.

Wait, if Y is at (a,c), then line YX is vertical (from X(a,0) to Y(a,c)), so line YT must be horizontal. Therefore, point T must lie on the horizontal line passing through Y. So, T has coordinates (d, c) for some d. However, previously, we had T lying on the y-axis if we assumed line WT is vertical. Wait, that may conflict. Earlier assumption was that T is at (0,b) because line WT is vertical. But according to this, T is at (d,c). Therefore, unless d=0 and c=b. So, combining both conditions, if T is at (0, b) and also on horizontal line through Y(a,c), then that requires that c = b, and d=0. Therefore, T would be (0, c). So, point T is (0,c), and Y is (a,c). Thus, line YT connects (a,c) to (0,c), which is horizontal, hence perpendicular to YX (vertical). Perfect. So that works.

So, current setup:

- W: (0,0)

- X: (a, 0)

- T: (0, c)

- Y: (a, c)

Because line YT is horizontal from (a,c) to (0,c), and line YX is vertical from (a,c) to (a,0). Also, line XW is from (a,0) to (0,0), horizontal, and line XY is vertical, so they are perpendicular at X.

Additionally, line WT is from (0,0) to (0,c), vertical, and line WX is horizontal, so they are perpendicular. Good.

Now, point Z lies on line YW. Line YW connects Y(a,c) to W(0,0). So parametric equation of line YW: starting at Y(a,c) going to W(0,0). So any point Z on line YW can be represented as Z(t) = (a - t*a, c - t*c) for t between 0 and 1. Or more simply, parameterizing with a parameter s such that Z divides YW in ratio s:(1-s). Alternatively, since Z is arbitrary on YW, but given other constraints, we need to find its position.

Moreover, there's another condition: Perpendicular(Line(TZ), Line(ZY)). So, at point Z, lines TZ and ZY are perpendicular.

Given that Z lies on YW, so Z is somewhere on YW. Let me write coordinates for Z. Let me parametrize Z as follows. Let me say that Z divides YW in some ratio. Let me use parameter k such that Z is located at a fraction k from Y to W. So coordinates of Z would be:

From Y(a,c) to W(0,0), so the vector is (-a, -c). So Z = Y + k*(vector YW) = (a - ka, c - kc) = (a(1 - k), c(1 - k)).

Alternatively, maybe easier to express Z as (ta, tc) where t ranges from 0 to 1? Wait, when t=0, it's (0,0)=W; when t=1, it's (a, c)=Y. Wait no, that would be if Z moves from W to Y. Wait, but the problem states that Z lies on line YW. So depending on direction, but let's assume Z is between Y and W, or possibly extended beyond?

But given that there are other constraints involving Z, like angle at Z between T and Y (angle(Z, T, Y) = angle 1), and angle at Z between W and T (angle(Z, W, T) = angle 3). Also, angle at Z between T and Y (angle(Z, T, Y)) is angle 1, which is given as 52 degrees? Wait no, wait:

Looking back, the given measures:

MeasureOf(Angle(T, Y, Z)) = 52 degrees. Wait, Angle(T, Y, Z) is the angle at Y between T and Z? Wait, no. In standard notation, Angle(A,B,C) is the angle at point B between points A and C. So Angle(T,Y,Z) is the angle at Y between points T and Z. Similarly, Angle(Z, Y, X) is the angle at Y between Z and X, which is given as 38 degrees.

So, given that, we know that at point Y, angle between Z and X is 38 degrees. And angle between T and Z is 52 degrees. Wait, but earlier we had that line YT is horizontal, and line YX is vertical. So at point Y, lines YT and YX are perpendicular. Wait, but if angle between YT and YX is 90 degrees. But according to the given, angle between ZY and YX is 38 degrees (since Angle(Z,Y,X) = 38). Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, let me clarify:

Angle(Z, Y, X) is the angle at Y between Z and X. So, that's the angle between YZ and YX. Given that YX is vertical (from Y(a,c) to X(a,0)), and YZ is from Y(a,c) to Z. Depending on where Z is on line YW, the angle between YZ and YX could vary.

Similarly, angle(T, Y, Z) is the angle at Y between T and Z, i.e., between YT and YZ. Which is given as 52 degrees. Since YT is horizontal (from Y(a,c) to T(0,c)), and YZ is from Y(a,c) to Z. So, angle between YT (horizontal) and YZ is 52 degrees. And angle between YZ and YX (which is vertical) is 38 degrees. Since YT is horizontal, YX is vertical, so together they form a right angle (90 degrees). Therefore, 52 + 38 = 90, which checks out. Perfect! So that gives us consistency.

Therefore, angle between YT (horizontal) and YZ is 52°, and angle between YZ and YX (vertical) is 38°, adding up to 90°. So that's good. Now, this tells us that line YZ makes an angle of 52° with YT (the horizontal line). Therefore, the slope of YZ can be determined.

Let me compute coordinates of Z. Since Y is at (a,c), and line YZ makes an angle of 52° with horizontal line YT (which is towards T(0,c)). So direction from Y to Z is making 52° above or below the horizontal? Wait, since angle between YT (towards T) and YZ is 52°, and YT is pointing towards left (from Y(a,c) to T(0,c)), so direction is to the left. If angle between YT (leftward) and YZ is 52°, then YZ is going upward or downward from Y?

Assuming the diagram is drawn in standard orientation, likely YZ is going downward from Y, making 52° with YT. Wait, but without knowing exact positions, it's hard, but since angle between YT and YZ is 52°, and YT is horizontal left, then YZ would go into the second quadrant relative to Y. But since Z lies on line YW, which goes from Y(a,c) to W(0,0). So Z is on that line. Therefore, from Y(a,c), moving towards W(0,0), which is straight down and left. Therefore, direction from Y to Z is towards southwest. Therefore, the angle between YT (leftward) and YZ (southwest) is 52°, meaning that YZ is deviating downward from the horizontal left direction. Therefore, the angle between YZ and the horizontal is 52°, so the slope of YZ corresponds to tan(52°).

But let me formalize this. Let me think about vector YZ. From Y(a,c) to Z. Since Z is on line YW, which goes from Y(a,c) to W(0,0). Parametric equations: Z = Y + t*(W - Y) = (a, c) + t*(-a, -c) = (a - ta, c - tc) = (a(1 - t), c(1 - t)), where t ∈ [0,1].

So coordinates of Z: (a(1 - t), c(1 - t)).

Vector YZ is Z - Y = (a(1 - t) - a, c(1 - t) - c) = (-a t, -c t).

The direction of YZ is (-a t, -c t), which simplifies to direction vector (-a, -c) scaled by t. So the direction vector is (-a, -c). Therefore, the slope of YZ is rise over run: (-c)/(-a) = c/a. So slope is c/a. 

But earlier, we said that the angle between YT (which is horizontal to the left, direction vector (-1, 0)) and YZ is 52 degrees. The slope of YZ is c/a, but direction is southwest. Let me relate this angle.

The angle between vector YT (direction (-1, 0)) and vector YZ (direction (-a, -c)) is 52 degrees. To find this angle, we can use the dot product formula.

Let me denote vector YT as u = (-1, 0), and vector YZ as v = (-a, -c). The angle θ between them satisfies:

cosθ = (u · v) / (|u||v|)

Compute u · v = (-1)(-a) + (0)(-c) = a.

|u| = sqrt((-1)^2 + 0^2) = 1.

|v| = sqrt(a² + c²).

Thus,

cosθ = a / sqrt(a² + c²)

We know θ is 52 degrees, so:

cos(52°) = a / sqrt(a² + c²)

Square both sides:

cos²(52°) = a² / (a² + c²)

Rearranged:

a² + c² = a² / cos²(52°)

Therefore,

c² = a² / cos²(52°) - a² = a² (1 / cos²(52°) - 1 ) = a² tan²(52°)

So,

c = a tan(52°)

Therefore, c = a * tan(52°). Let me calculate tan(52°):

tan(52°) ≈ 1.2799 (exact value depends on calculator, but assuming approximate value)

But maybe we don't need actual numbers yet. Let me keep it symbolic.

So, c = a tan(52°). Therefore, the coordinates of Z are (a(1 - t), c(1 - t)) = (a(1 - t), a tan(52°)(1 - t)).

But we can also find t? Not sure yet. However, maybe we can proceed.

Next, we have another condition: Perpendicular(Line(TZ), Line(ZY)). So, at point Z, lines TZ and ZY are perpendicular. Let me verify this.

Vector ZT is T - Z. Coordinates of T are (0, c). Coordinates of Z are (a(1 - t), c(1 - t)). So vector ZT is (0 - a(1 - t), c - c(1 - t)) = (-a(1 - t), c t).

Vector ZY is Y - Z. Coordinates of Y are (a, c). So vector ZY is (a - a(1 - t), c - c(1 - t)) = (a t, c t).

For lines TZ and ZY to be perpendicular, their vectors must have a dot product of zero.

Dot product of ZT and ZY:

[ -a(1 - t) ] * [ a t ] + [ c t ] * [ c t ] = -a² t (1 - t) + c² t².

Set equal to zero:

-a² t (1 - t) + c² t² = 0

Factor t:

t [ -a² (1 - t) + c² t ] = 0

Solutions are t=0 or -a²(1 - t) + c² t = 0.

t=0 would correspond to Z=W, but then angle(Z,W,T) would be undefined or something else, probably not. So we take the other solution:

-a²(1 - t) + c² t = 0 → -a² + a² t + c² t = 0 → t(a² + c²) = a² → t = a² / (a² + c²)

Earlier, we found that c² = a² tan²(52°). Substitute:

t = a² / [a² + a² tan²(52°)] = 1 / [1 + tan²(52°)] = 1 / sec²(52°) = cos²(52°)

Therefore, t = cos²(52°)

So, coordinates of Z:

x-coordinate: a(1 - t) = a [1 - cos²(52°)] = a sin²(52°)

y-coordinate: c(1 - t) = a tan(52°) * sin²(52°)

But maybe we don't need exact coordinates. Instead, we can use this relationship.

Now, moving forward. Our target is to find measure of angle 3, which is equal to measure of angle(Z, W, T). That is, angle at W between Z and T.

So, angle 3 is ∠ZW T, which is the angle at point W between points Z and T.

Points:

W is at (0,0)

Z is at (a sin²(52°), a tan(52°) sin²(52°)) ?

Wait, earlier, we had:

Coordinates of Z: (a(1 - t), c(1 - t)), and t = cos²(52°), so 1 - t = 1 - cos²(52°) = sin²(52°). Therefore, coordinates of Z are:

x = a sin²(52°)

y = c sin²(52°) = [a tan(52°)] sin²(52°)

But tan(52°) = sin(52°)/cos(52°), so substituting:

y = a [sin(52°)/cos(52°)] * sin²(52°) = a sin³(52°)/cos(52°)

But maybe we don't need exact expressions. Let's focus on vectors.

To find angle at W between Z and T. Points:

At W(0,0), lines WZ and WT. So vectors WZ and WT.

Vector WZ is from W(0,0) to Z(a sin²(52°), a tan(52°) sin²(52°)) → (a sin²(52°), a tan(52°) sin²(52°))

Vector WT is from W(0,0) to T(0, c) → (0, c) = (0, a tan(52°)).

So angle between vectors WZ and WT is angle 3. Let's compute this angle using dot product.

Let me denote vector WZ as (x, y) = (a sin²(52°), a tan(52°) sin²(52°)) and vector WT as (0, c) = (0, a tan(52°)).

Dot product of WZ and WT is x*0 + y*c = y*c = [a tan(52°) sin²(52°)] * [a tan(52°)] = a² tan²(52°) sin²(52°)

Wait, no. Wait, vector WZ is (x, y) = (a sin²(52°), a tan(52°) sin²(52°)), and vector WT is (0, a tan(52°)).

So the dot product is x * 0 + y * (a tan(52°)) = [a tan(52°) sin²(52°)] * [a tan(52°)] ? No, no. Wait, the vector WT is (0, a tan(52°)), so the y-component is a tan(52°). Vector WZ has y-component a tan(52°) sin²(52°). Therefore, the dot product is (a sin²(52°))*0 + (a tan(52°) sin²(52°))*(a tan(52°)) ?

No, wait, the dot product is (WZ_x)*(WT_x) + (WZ_y)*(WT_y). So:

WZ_x is a sin²(52°), WT_x is 0 → term is 0.

WZ_y is a tan(52°) sin²(52°), WT_y is a tan(52°). Therefore, the dot product is:

0 + [a tan(52°) sin²(52°)] * [a tan(52°)] = a² tan²(52°) sin²(52°)

Magnitude of WZ: sqrt(x² + y²) = sqrt( [a² sin⁴(52°)] + [a² tan²(52°) sin⁴(52°)] )

Factor out a² sin⁴(52°):

sqrt( a² sin⁴(52°) [1 + tan²(52°)] )

Note that 1 + tan²(theta) = sec²(theta), so:

sqrt( a² sin⁴(52°) * sec²(52°) ) = a sin²(52°) * sec(52°) = a sin²(52°) / cos(52°)

Magnitude of WT: sqrt(0² + [a tan(52°)]² ) = a tan(52°)

Therefore, the cosine of angle 3 is:

[dot product] / [ |WZ| * |WT| ] = [a² tan²(52°) sin²(52°)] / [a sin²(52°)/cos(52°) * a tan(52°) ]

Simplify denominator:

a sin²(52°)/cos(52°) * a tan(52°) = a² sin²(52°) tan(52°) / cos(52°)

But tan(52°) = sin(52°)/cos(52°), so substitute:

Denominator becomes a² sin²(52°) * [sin(52°)/cos(52°)] / cos(52°) = a² sin³(52°) / cos²(52°)

Numerator is a² tan²(52°) sin²(52°) = a² [sin²(52°)/cos²(52°)] * sin²(52°) = a² sin⁴(52°)/cos²(52°)

So overall:

cos(angle 3) = [a² sin⁴(52°)/cos²(52°)] / [a² sin³(52°)/cos²(52°)] ] = [sin⁴ / cos²] / [sin³ / cos²] ] = sin(52°)

Therefore, cos(angle 3) = sin(52°)

But sin(52°) = cos(90° - 52°) = cos(38°). Hence,

cos(angle 3) = cos(38°)

Therefore, angle 3 is either 38° or -38°, but since angles are between 0 and 180°, angle 3 = 38°.

Wait, but let me confirm. Because cos(angle 3) = cos(38°), so angle 3 could be 38°, or 360°-38°, but since angle 3 is an angle in a geometric figure, it must be between 0 and 180°, so 38° is valid.

But wait, the answer choices include B. 38. However, let me check again. Because angle 3 is ∠ZW T. Is this possible?

Wait, but angle 3 is ∠ZW T, which is at point W between Z and T. Given our construction, with Z on line YW, and T at (0,c). So, from point W(0,0), looking towards Z and T. Since Z is on line YW, which goes from Y(a,c) to W(0,0). So, Z is between Y and W or beyond? Earlier, we had t = cos²(52°). Since cos²(52°) is approximately (cos(52°))^2 ≈ (0.6157)^2 ≈ 0.38, so t ≈ 0.38, which is between 0 and 1, so Z is between Y and W.

Therefore, from point W, line WZ goes towards Z, which is between Y and W. Line WT goes directly up to T(0,c). Therefore, angle between WZ and WT is angle 3. According to calculation, that angle is 38 degrees. So answer is B. 38. But let me check if there's a mistake here.

Wait, but angle 3 is ∠ZW T. Another way to think: In triangle WZT, angle at W. So, if we can find other angles or sides.

Alternatively, since we found that cos(angle 3) = sin(52°) = cos(38°), so angle 3 = 38°, yes. Therefore, answer is B.

But wait, let me cross-validate with another approach. Since earlier, we had angle at Y between YT and YZ is 52°, and between YZ and YX is 38°, adding to 90°, which matches. Then, considering triangle WZT, with angle at W being angle 3, and other relations.

Alternatively, since Z lies on YW, and we have various right angles. Maybe there's another way.

But according to the calculation, angle 3 is 38°, which is option B. However, let me check if there's a possibility that angle 3 is supplementary or something. For example, if my calculation shows cos(angle 3) = sin(52°) = cos(38°), then angle 3 is 38°, yes. Unless there's a reflection or something else.

Alternatively, maybe I made an error in the sign during the dot product? Let me recheck.

We had:

cos(angle 3) = sin(52°). Since cos(angle) = sin(52°), then angle is 90° - 52° = 38°, because sin(theta) = cos(90° - theta). Yes. Therefore, angle 3 is 38°, which is option B. But let me check the answer choices again.

Answer Choices:

A. 28

B. 38

C. 52

D. 62

So, B is 38. But wait, is there any chance that angle 3 is actually 52°, but due to some other configuration? Or did I mix up the angle?

Wait, angle 3 is ∠ZW T. Let me visualize again. Point W is at origin, T is at (0,c), Z is somewhere between Y and W. So, from W, line WT goes up to T, and line WZ goes to Z which is on YW. So, depending on where Z is, the angle between WZ and WT.

But according to the calculation, it's 38°, which matches with given data. Also, given that angle at Y between YT and YZ is 52°, and between YZ and YX is 38°, which adds up to 90°, and angle at W is 38°, which seems consistent.

However, let me think again. Suppose angle 3 is 38°, then why isn't it matching with other angles? It seems okay.

Alternatively, maybe there's an alternative approach using triangle properties.

Since lines TZ and ZY are perpendicular, so triangle TZ Y is right-angled at Z. So, in triangle TZ Y, right-angled at Z. Then, angle at Y is 52°, angle at Z is 90°, so angle at T would be 180 - 52 - 90 = 38°. Wait, but angle at T in triangle TZ Y would be angle at T between Z and Y, which is angle(T, Z, Y). But the given measure of angle(T, Y, Z) is 52°, which is angle at Y. Wait, confusion arises again.

In triangle TZ Y, with right angle at Z:

- angle at Y is 52°, angle at T is ?

Sum of angles is 180°, so angle at T = 180 - 90 - 52 = 38°. Therefore, angle at T in triangle TZ Y is 38°, which is angle(T, Z, Y). Wait, but angle(T, Z, Y) is angle at Z between T and Y? No, angle(T, Z, Y) is angle at Z between T and Y. Wait no:

Angle(T, Z, Y) is angle at Z between T and Y. Wait, no:

Standard notation: Angle(A,B,C) is angle at B. So angle(T,Z,Y) is angle at Z between T and Y. So in triangle TZ Y, angle at Z is 90°, angle at Y is 52°, angle at T is 38°. So angle at T is 38°, which would be angle(T, Z, Y). Wait, but the given measure of angle(T, Y, Z) is 52°, which is angle at Y between T and Z. So that matches with the previous statement. So angle at Y is 52°, angle at T is 38°, angle at Z is 90°.

But how does this relate to angle 3, which is angle(Z, W, T)? That is, angle at W between Z and T. How can we connect this?

Perhaps via triangle WZT. Let me look at triangle WZT. We know some sides or angles?

Well, we have coordinates, but maybe there's another way. Since we have a right angle at Z in triangle TZ Y, and other relations.

Alternatively, since we found angle 3 is 38°, which is same as angle at T in triangle TZ Y. Could there be some similarity or congruence?

Alternatively, maybe using cyclic quadrilaterals or other properties. But maybe not necessary.

Alternatively, since angle 3 is 38°, which is same as angle at T in triangle TZ Y. But why?

Maybe there is a connection between triangles WZT and TZ Y? Not sure.

But according to the calculation earlier, angle 3 is 38°, which is answer B. However, I want to ensure that there's no mistake in the calculation.

Another way to check: suppose angle 3 is 38°, then what?

If angle 3 is 38°, then in triangle WZT, we have angle at W is 38°, angle at Z is ...?

Wait, but we don't know anything about triangle WZT except angle at W. But maybe if we can find other angles.

Alternatively, since line WT is vertical, and line WZ is some line making angle 3 with WT. If angle 3 is 38°, then that would make sense with other angles. 

But I think the earlier calculation is solid. So angle 3 is 38°, answer B. But let me check once more.

Wait, during the calculation, we derived that cos(angle 3) = sin(52°) = cos(38°), implying angle 3 = 38°. That seems correct. Therefore, answer is B. 38.

But wait, looking back at the problem statement, the question asks for m∠3, which is equal to measure of angle(Z, W, T). In the process, we found that angle is 38°, so answer is B. However, let me check if there's any other interpretation.

Wait, but in the initial problem, there are four angles labeled 1,2,3,4. The given measures are:

- MeasureOf(Angle(T,Y,Z)) = 52°, which is angle at Y between T and Z, which we used as 52°.

- MeasureOf(Angle(Z,Y,X)) = 38°, which is angle at Y between Z and X, which we used as 38°.

Other angles:

Angle(W,T,Z) = angle 4.

Angle(Z,W,T) = angle 3.

Angle(X,W,Y) = angle 2.

Angle(Z,T,Y) = angle 1.

But in our case, angle 1 is angle(Z,T,Y), which is angle at T between Z and Y, which we found earlier in triangle TZ Y as 38°, so angle 1 = 38°, angle 3 is 38°, angle 2 and angle 4 are unknowns. But since the question only asks for angle 3, which we found as 38°, so answer B.

Yes, that seems correct. Therefore, Final Answer: B.
