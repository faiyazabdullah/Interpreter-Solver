MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. Hmm, so we have several points and lines with certain constraints. Let me start by listing out all the given information to make sure I don't miss anything.

First, the problem states that EB is parallel to DC. So, line EB || line DC. Also, there are some length equalities and point positions. Let me jot down each constraint:

1. Length of BC is 5 units. So, BC = 5.
2. Length of BA is x - 2. So, BA = x - 2.
3. Length of AD is 10 units. AD = 10.
4. Length of ED is 4 units. ED = 4.
5. Point E lies on line AD. So, E is somewhere between A and D, or maybe extended?
6. Point B lies on line AC. So, B is somewhere along the line connecting A and C.
7. Lines CD and BE are parallel. Wait, no—the original statement says Parallel(Line(C,D), Line(B,E)). So CD || BE.

Wait, but the question says EB || DC. But since DC is the same as CD (just opposite direction), so yes, they're parallel. So, EB || DC, which is equivalent to CD || BE. So that's consistent.

So, the key here is probably using similar triangles because of the parallel lines. Since there are parallel lines, maybe there are similar triangles formed by these lines.

Let me try to visualize the figure. Points A, B, C, D, E. Let me think about how they connect.

We know that point B lies on line AC. So, points A, B, C are colinear with B between A and C? Or could be extended?

Also, point E lies on line AD. So, points A, D, E are colinear with E possibly between A and D or beyond.

Additionally, lines CD and BE are parallel. So, line CD connects points C and D, and line BE connects points B and E. These two lines are parallel.

Hmm. Maybe I can use coordinate geometry here? Assign coordinates to points and set up equations based on the given lengths and slopes.

Alternatively, maybe using ratios from similar triangles. Let's see.

Since BE || CD, then perhaps triangle ABE is similar to triangle ACD? Wait, but need to check if angles correspond.

But first, let's consider coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to simplify.

Let me place point A at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, since AD is 10 units long, and E lies on AD. Let me assume AD is horizontal for easier calculation. Let me suppose that AD is along the x-axis. So, point A is (0,0). Let me say point D is at (10,0), since AD = 10. Therefore, coordinates of D are (10, 0).

Now, point E lies on AD. Let me denote E's coordinates as (e, 0), where e is between 0 and 10 or outside. The distance from E to D is 4. Since D is at (10, 0), the distance ED is |10 - e| = 4. Therefore, solving for e:

10 - e = ±4 ⇒ e = 10 ∓ 4. So e = 10 - 4 = 6 or e = 10 + 4 = 14. Therefore, E is either at (6, 0) or (14, 0). But since E lies on AD, which goes from A(0,0) to D(10,0), then if E is between A and D, e would be between 0 and 10. However, if e=6, that's between A and D. If e=14, it's beyond D. Depending on the configuration, both possibilities exist. But maybe more info will help determine which one it is.

Now, moving on. We also know that point B lies on line AC. Let me define coordinates for point C. Wait, but we don't know where C is yet. However, we do know that BC has length 5. Also, BA is x - 2. So, BA is the distance from B to A, which is (x - 2). And BC is 5.

But without knowing coordinates for C, this might be tricky. Alternatively, maybe I can express coordinates for B in terms of variables.

Since B lies on line AC, let me parametrize line AC. But I need coordinates for point C. Alternatively, maybe I can find relations through the parallel lines.

Given that BE || CD. Let me recall that slope of BE equals slope of CD.

But since I've already placed A at (0,0), D at (10,0), and E at (e, 0). Let me consider coordinates for point C. Let me assume that line AC is arbitrary; but since B lies on AC, maybe I can parameterize point C as well.

Alternatively, maybe assign coordinates to other points. Let me proceed step by step.

Let me first fix coordinates for A(0,0), D(10,0), E(e, 0) where e is 6 or 14.

Now, point B lies on line AC. Let me denote coordinates for point C as (c_x, c_y). Then line AC connects A(0,0) to C(c_x, c_y). Any point on line AC can be expressed as t*(c_x, c_y), where t is a scalar parameter. So, point B can be represented as (t*c_x, t*c_y) for some t between 0 and 1 (if between A and C) or outside.

The distance BA is x - 2. Since BA is the distance from B to A, which is sqrt[(t*c_x)^2 + (t*c_y)^2] = t*sqrt(c_x² + c_y²). Let me call the length AC as L, then BA = t*L. But I don't know L yet.

But we also know that BC = 5. The distance from B to C would be sqrt[(c_x - t*c_x)^2 + (c_y - t*c_y)^2] = sqrt[(c_x(1 - t))² + (c_y(1 - t))²] = (1 - t)*sqrt(c_x² + c_y²) = (1 - t)L. Therefore, BC = (1 - t)L = 5. So, from BA = tL = x - 2, and BC = (1 - t)L = 5. Adding them together gives BA + BC = tL + (1 - t)L = L = x - 2 + 5 = x + 3. So, L = x + 3. But L is the length of AC, which is sqrt(c_x² + c_y²). However, I don't know c_x and c_y yet.

But perhaps I can relate this to the other condition involving the parallel lines.

We also have that BE || CD. Let me compute the slopes of BE and CD.

Coordinates of B: (t*c_x, t*c_y)

Coordinates of E: (e, 0)

Therefore, vector BE is (e - t*c_x, 0 - t*c_y). So slope of BE is (-t*c_y)/(e - t*c_x).

Coordinates of C: (c_x, c_y)

Coordinates of D: (10, 0)

Vector CD is (10 - c_x, 0 - c_y). Slope of CD is (-c_y)/(10 - c_x).

Since BE || CD, their slopes must be equal. Therefore:

(-t*c_y)/(e - t*c_x) = (-c_y)/(10 - c_x)

Assuming c_y ≠ 0 (otherwise, points would be colinear in a way that may not satisfy other conditions), we can divide both sides by -c_y:

t / (e - t*c_x) = 1 / (10 - c_x)

Cross-multiplying:

t*(10 - c_x) = e - t*c_x

Expanding left side: 10t - t*c_x

Right side: e - t*c_x

Subtracting right side from left side:

10t - t*c_x - e + t*c_x = 10t - e = 0 → 10t = e → t = e/10.

So, t = e/10.

Interesting. So, the parameter t is e divided by 10.

But remember earlier, we had expressions involving t and L.

Earlier, we had that BA = tL = x - 2, and BC = (1 - t)L = 5. Also, L = x + 3.

So substituting t = e/10 into BA and BC:

BA = tL = (e/10)*(x + 3) = x - 2.

And BC = (1 - t)L = [1 - e/10]*(x + 3) = 5.

So now we have two equations:

1. (e/10)(x + 3) = x - 2

2. [1 - e/10](x + 3) = 5

Let me write these equations:

Equation 1: (e(x + 3))/10 = x - 2

Equation 2: [(10 - e)/10](x + 3) = 5

Note that equation 2 can be rewritten as (10 - e)(x + 3)/10 = 5.

Multiply both sides by 10: (10 - e)(x + 3) = 50.

Similarly, equation 1: e(x + 3) = 10(x - 2)

So, we have:

From equation 1: e(x + 3) = 10x - 20

From equation 2: (10 - e)(x + 3) = 50

If we add equations 1 and 2:

[e(x + 3)] + [(10 - e)(x + 3)] = 10x - 20 + 50

Left side: [e + 10 - e]*(x + 3) = 10(x + 3)

Right side: 10x + 30

Thus,

10(x + 3) = 10x + 30 → Which simplifies to 10x + 30 = 10x + 30. So, identity. Hence, no new information. So need another approach.

So, we have two equations:

1. e(x + 3) = 10x - 20

2. (10 - e)(x + 3) = 50

Let me expand equation 2:

10(x + 3) - e(x + 3) = 50

Which becomes:

10(x + 3) - e(x + 3) = 50

But from equation 1, e(x + 3) = 10x - 20. Substitute that into above:

10(x + 3) - (10x - 20) = 50

Compute left side:

10x + 30 - 10x + 20 = 50 → 50 = 50. Again, identity. So again, no new information.

This suggests that we need another relation to solve for x. Perhaps we need to use the value of e?

Recall that earlier, when we considered point E on AD, we had two possibilities for e: 6 or 14. Because ED = 4, so e was either 6 or 14. Let me check both cases.

Case 1: e = 6.

Then, substitute e = 6 into equation 1: 6(x + 3) = 10x - 20

Expand: 6x + 18 = 10x - 20 → 18 + 20 = 10x - 6x → 38 = 4x → x = 38/4 = 9.5. Which is option C.

Case 2: e = 14.

Then, substitute e = 14 into equation 1: 14(x + 3) = 10x - 20

Expand: 14x + 42 = 10x - 20 → 14x -10x = -20 -42 → 4x = -62 → x = -15.5. That's negative, which would imply BA = x - 2 = -17.5, which is impossible since length can't be negative. Thus, this case is invalid.

Hence, only e = 6 is valid, leading to x = 9.5, which is option C.

But wait, let me confirm that with the second equation. For e = 6:

Equation 2: (10 - 6)(x + 3) = 4(x + 3) = 50 → x + 3 = 50/4 = 12.5 → x = 12.5 - 3 = 9.5. Same result. So x = 9.5. So answer is C.

But let me check whether my assumption about coordinates is correct. For example, did I assume that E is between A and D? Well, if e = 6, then E is between A(0,0) and D(10,0), which makes sense. If e were 14, then E would be beyond D, but that leads to negative x. So the correct value is e = 6, leading to x = 9.5, which is option C.

Therefore, the answer should be C. 9.5.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the geometric relationships and applying algebraic reasoning based on the given constraints. Here’s the step-by-step breakdown:

---

### **Step 1: Assign Coordinates**

We place the points on a coordinate plane to simplify calculations:

- Let $ A = (0, 0) $
- Let $ D = (10, 0) $ since $ AD = 10 $
- Let $ E $ lie on segment $ AD $. Given $ ED = 4 $, possible values for $ E $ are $ (6, 0) $ or $ (14, 0) $

---

### **Step 2: Use the Parallelism Condition**

Given that $ BE \parallel CD $, the slopes of segments $ BE $ and $ CD $ must be equal.

Let $ B $ lie on line $ AC $, which means $ B $ has coordinates dependent on the position of point $ C $, but we'll keep this general until needed.

Let’s define the parameter $ t $ such that $ B = (tc_x, tc_y) $, where $ C = (c_x, c_y) $ and $ t $ is a scalar representing the fraction of the path from $ A $ to $ C $.

Using this, the slope of $ BE $ is:
$$
\text{slope}_{BE} = \frac{0 - tc_y}{e - tc_x}
$$

The slope of $ CD $ is:
$$
\text{slope}_{CD} = \frac{0 - c_y}{10 - c_x}
$$

Setting the slopes equal:
$$
\frac{-tc_y}{e - tc_x} = \frac{-c_y}{10 - c_x}
$$

Cancel $ -c_y $ (assuming $ c_y \neq 0 $):
$$
\frac{t}{e - tc_x} = \frac{1}{10 - c_x}
$$

Cross-multiplying:
$$
t(10 - c_x) = e - tc_x
$$

Solving for $ t $:
$$
10t - tc_x = e - tc_x \Rightarrow 10t = e \Rightarrow t = \frac{e}{10}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Express Lengths Using Parameter $ t $**

Let’s denote:

- $ BA = x - 2 $
- $ BC = 5 $
- Total length $ AC = x + 3 $ (since $ BA + BC = x + 3 $)

From earlier:
$$
BA = t \cdot AC = \frac{e}{10}(x + 3) = x - 2 \\
BC = (1 - t) \cdot AC = \left(1 - \frac{e}{10}\right)(x + 3) = 5
$$

These give us two equations:
1. $ \frac{e}{10}(x + 3) = x - 2 $
2. $ \left(1 - \frac{e}{10}\right)(x + 3) = 5 $

---

### **Step 4: Solve the System**

From Equation (1):
$$
\frac{e}{10}(x + 3) = x - 2 \Rightarrow e(x + 3) = 10x - 20 \tag{1}
$$

From Equation (2):
$$
\left(1 - \frac{e}{10}\right)(x + 3) = 5 \Rightarrow (10 - e)(x + 3) = 50 \tag{2}
$$

Add Equations (1) and (2):

$$
e(x + 3) + (10 - e)(x + 3) = 10x - 20 + 50
\Rightarrow 10(x + 3) = 10x + 30
$$

This confirms consistency but does not yield new information directly. Instead, we test values of $ e $ based on the constraint $ ED = 4 $.

---

### **Step 5: Test Values of $ e $**

From earlier, $ E $ lies on $ AD $, so $ |10 - e| = 4 $ gives $ e = 6 $ or $ e = 14 $.

#### Case 1: $ e = 6 $

Plug into Equation (1):
$$
6(x + 3) = 10x - 20 \Rightarrow 6x + 18 = 10x - 20 \Rightarrow 4x = 38 \Rightarrow x = 9.5
$$

Check Equation (2):
$$
(10 - 6)(x + 3) = 4(x + 3) = 50 \Rightarrow x + 3 = 12.5 \Rightarrow x = 9.5
$$

Consistent!

#### Case 2: $ e = 14 $

Plug into Equation (1):
$$
14(x + 3) = 10x - 20 \Rightarrow 14x + 42 = 10x - 20 \Rightarrow 4x = -62 \Rightarrow x = -15.5
$$

Negative value for $ x $ implies negative length for $ BA $, which is invalid. Disregard.

---

### **Conclusion**

Only $ e = 6 $ yields a valid solution. This gives:
$$
x = 9.5
$$

---

**Final Answer: C**  
$$
\boxed{\text{C}}
$$
