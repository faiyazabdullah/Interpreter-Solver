MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, and C. The problem gives us some constraints:

First, the length of line AB is equal to x. Then, the measure of angle ACB (wait, no—angle at point C? Wait, the notation Angle(A, C, B) means the angle at point C between points A and B. So that's angle ACB, right? So angle at C is 60 degrees. Also, the length of BC is 17 units. The length of AC is y. And there's another condition: lines AB and AC are perpendicular. So, line AB is perpendicular to line AC. 

So, let me visualize this. Points A, B, C. Let me try to sketch mentally. Since AB and AC are perpendicular, that suggests that triangle ABC has a right angle at A? Wait, because AB and AC are two sides meeting at A. If they are perpendicular, then angle at A is 90 degrees. But wait, the given angle is at point C, which is 60 degrees. Hmm. So triangle ABC with right angle at A, and angle at C being 60 degrees. Let me confirm.

Wait, angle at C is 60 degrees. So in triangle ABC, angles sum up to 180. So angle at A is 90°, angle at C is 60°, so angle at B would be 180 - 90 - 60 = 30 degrees. That makes sense. So triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at A, with angles 90°, 60°, 30°. 

Now, we need to find x, which is the length of AB. Given that BC is 17. Let me recall the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle. In such triangles, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. Specifically, the side opposite 30° is the shortest one, then the side opposite 60°, then the hypotenuse. 

But first, let's identify which sides correspond to which angles. In triangle ABC, right-angled at A. So, angle at A is 90°, angle at C is 60°, so angle at B is 30°. Therefore:

- Side opposite angle A (which is BC) is the hypotenuse. Because in a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. Wait, angle A is the right angle, so the hypotenuse is BC. Therefore, BC is the hypotenuse. 

Then, the side opposite angle B (which is 30°) is AC. Because angle B is 30°, so the opposite side is AC. Similarly, the side opposite angle C (60°) is AB. 

In a standard 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are:

- Opposite 30°: shortest leg = 1
- Opposite 60°: longer leg = √3
- Hypotenuse = 2

Therefore, ratios: shorter leg : longer leg : hypotenuse = 1 : √3 : 2

So here, since BC is the hypotenuse (opposite the right angle at A), its length is 17. Therefore, hypotenuse = 17. Then, the legs are AB and AC. Which ones are which?

Angle at B is 30°, so the side opposite to it is AC. So AC is the shorter leg (since 30° is opposite to the shorter leg). Wait, but angle at B is 30°, so the side opposite to angle B is AC. Therefore, AC is opposite 30°, meaning AC is the shorter leg. Then AB is opposite angle C, which is 60°, so AB is the longer leg.

Thus, in terms of ratios:

Shorter leg (AC) corresponds to 1, longer leg (AB) corresponds to √3, hypotenuse (BC) corresponds to 2.

Given that hypotenuse BC is 17, so 2k = 17 => k = 17/2. Therefore, the shorter leg AC = k*1 = 17/2, and longer leg AB = k√3 = (17/2)√3. Wait, but the question asks for x, which is the length of AB. So x equals (17/2)√3. Looking at the answer choices, option C is (17/2)√3. So that should be the answer.

Let me verify again. Alternatively, maybe I mixed up the legs. Let me check once more.

In triangle ABC, right-angled at A. So sides:

AB and AC are the legs, BC is the hypotenuse.

Angle at C is 60°, so angle between BC and AC is 60°. Wait, perhaps I should use trigonometric ratios.

Alternatively, using trigonometry. Let's consider angle at C is 60°, so tan(angle C) = opposite / adjacent. For angle C, the opposite side is AB, and adjacent is AC. Therefore:

tan(60°) = AB / AC. 

Also, since it's a right triangle, Pythagoras: AB² + AC² = BC².

We also know BC = 17, so AB² + AC² = 17² = 289.

From tan(60°) = AB / AC. Since tan(60°) is √3, so AB = AC * √3.

Substituting into Pythagoras equation:

(AC * √3)^2 + AC^2 = 289  
=> 3 AC² + AC² = 289  
=> 4 AC² = 289  
=> AC² = 289 / 4  
=> AC = 17/2.

Then AB = AC * √3 = (17/2) * √3. Hence, x = AB = (17/2)√3, which is option C. 

Yes, that matches. So the correct answer is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, which represents the length of segment $ AB $, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration described:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Triangle Configuration**

We are given:

- $ \text{Length}(AB) = x $
- $ \angle ACB = 60^\circ $
- $ \text{Length}(BC) = 17 $
- $ \text{Length}(AC) = y $
- $ \overline{AB} \perp \overline{AC} $

This implies that triangle $ \triangle ABC $ is a **right triangle** with the right angle at vertex $ A $. Additionally, angle $ \angle ACB = 60^\circ $, making the triangle a special type of **30–60–90 triangle**, as the third angle at vertex $ B $ will be $ 30^\circ $ (since the total interior angles of a triangle sum to $ 180^\circ $).

---

### **Step 2: Use Properties of a 30–60–90 Triangle**

In a **30–60–90 triangle**, the sides are in the fixed ratio:

$$
\text{Side opposite } 30^\circ : \text{Side opposite } 60^\circ : \text{Hypotenuse} = 1 : \sqrt{3} : 2
$$

Here, the hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle, which is $ BC = 17 $.

Since angle $ C = 60^\circ $, the side opposite it is $ AB $, which is the **longer leg**.  
The side opposite $ 30^\circ $ is $ AC $, which is the **shorter leg**.

Using the known hypotenuse $ BC = 17 $, we can compute the scale factor $ k $:

$$
\text{Hypotenuse} = 2k = 17 \Rightarrow k = \frac{17}{2}
$$

Then,

$$
AB = k \cdot \sqrt{3} = \frac{17}{2} \cdot \sqrt{3}
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

The length of $ AB $, denoted as $ x $, is:

$$
x = \frac{17}{2} \sqrt{3}
$$

This matches **Option C**.

---

### Final Answer: C

$$
\boxed{\text{C}}
$$
