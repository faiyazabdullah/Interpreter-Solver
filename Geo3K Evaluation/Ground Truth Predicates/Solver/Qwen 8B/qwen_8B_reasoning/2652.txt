MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have triangle ABC with some given side lengths and a right angle at point C. Wait, the problem says that lines CA and CB are perpendicular. That means angle C is a right angle because those two lines form the angle at point C. So triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at C. 

Given that, the sides opposite the angles would be as follows. Let me recall the Pythagorean theorem here. Since it's a right triangle, the sum of squares of the legs equals the square of the hypotenuse. The legs are AC and BC, which have lengths b and a respectively. Wait, hold on. Let me check again. 

The problem states: Length of line CB is a, length of line AC is b, and length of AB is c. Wait, so CB is a, AC is b. Then AB is c. But since angle C is the right angle, then AB should be the hypotenuse. Therefore, according to Pythagoras:

a² + b² = c²

Let me check with the given values. If a=14, b=48, then a² + b² is 14² + 48². Let me compute that. 14 squared is 196, 48 squared is 2304. Adding them together gives 196 + 2304 = 2500. And c is given as 50. 50 squared is 2500. Perfect, that checks out. So the triangle is indeed a right-angled triangle at C.

Now, the question is asking for sin A. In triangle ABC, angle A is at vertex A. To find sin A, I need to remember the definition of sine in a right-angled triangle. Sine of an angle is the ratio of the opposite side over the hypotenuse. 

So, angle A is at point A. The opposite side to angle A would be the side that's opposite, which is BC. Wait, BC is length a, which is 14. The hypotenuse is AB, which is c=50. Therefore, sin A = opposite / hypotenuse = BC / AB = a / c = 14 / 50. Simplifying that fraction, divide numerator and denominator by 2: 7/25. Converting that to decimal, 7 divided by 25 is 0.28. 

Looking at the answer choices, option B is 0.28. So that should be the answer. Let me just double-check my reasoning. 

Alternatively, maybe I confused the sides? Let me visualize the triangle again. Right angle at C, so sides AC and BC are the legs, AB is the hypotenuse. Angle A is at vertex A, so the sides adjacent to angle A are AC (which is length b=48) and the hypotenuse AB (length 50). The side opposite angle A is BC (length a=14). Yes, so sin A = opposite / hypotenuse = 14/50 = 0.28. Yep, that seems correct. 

Another way to think about it: using coordinates. Suppose point C is at (0,0), since it's the right angle. Then point A could be along the x-axis, so coordinates (b, 0) = (48, 0). Point B would be along the y-axis, coordinates (0, a) = (0,14). Then AB connects (48,0) to (0,14). The length of AB is sqrt((48)^2 + (14)^2) = 50, which matches. Now, angle A is at (48,0). To find sin A, perhaps using vectors or coordinate geometry?

Alternatively, using trigonometry. In triangle ABC, angle A has adjacent side AC (length b=48), opposite side BC (length a=14), hypotenuse AB (c=50). So yes, sin A = opposite/hypotenuse = 14/50 = 0.28. So answer B. 

I don't see any mistakes here. All steps confirm that sin A is 0.28. So the correct choice is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine $\sin A$ in the given right triangle $ABC$, we begin by analyzing the geometric setup and applying fundamental trigonometric principles.

### Step 1: Understand the Geometry

We're told:
- $\overline{CB} = a = 14$
- $\overline{AC} = b = 48$
- $\overline{AB} = c = 50$
- $\angle C = 90^\circ$ (since lines $\overline{CA}$ and $\overline{CB}$ are perpendicular)

This confirms that triangle $ABC$ is a **right triangle** with the right angle at point $C$. Thus, the hypotenuse is $\overline{AB} = c = 50$, and the legs are $\overline{AC} = b = 48$ and $\overline{BC} = a = 14$.

---

### Step 2: Use Trigonometric Definition of Sine

In a right triangle, the sine of an acute angle is defined as:

$$
\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
$$

For angle $A$, the **side opposite** is $\overline{BC} = a = 14$, and the **hypotenuse** is $\overline{AB} = c = 50$. Hence,

$$
\sin A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{a}{c} = \frac{14}{50}
$$

---

### Step 3: Simplify the Expression

$$
\frac{14}{50} = \frac{7}{25} = 0.28
$$

---

### Final Answer

After verifying both the geometric configuration and the trigonometric identity, we conclude that:

$$
\sin A = 0.28
$$

Thus, the correct answer is:

$$
\boxed{\text{B}}
$$
