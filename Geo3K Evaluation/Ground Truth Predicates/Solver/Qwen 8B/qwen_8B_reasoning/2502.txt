MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have some constraints here. Let me start by breaking down each part.

First, the problem says that the measure of angle ABC (which is angle at point B between points A, B, C) is equal to the measure of angle 4. Then, it tells us that the measure of angle DAB (so angle at point A between points D, A, B) is 123 degrees. Also, there's a condition that point A lies on line CD. And another important thing: lines CB and CD are perpendicular. Wait, no—wait, Perpendicular(Line(C,B), Line(C,D)). So line CB is perpendicular to line CD. That means they form a right angle at point C, right?

Let me sketch this mentally. Let me imagine points C and D connected by a line. Since CB is perpendicular to CD, then CB forms a 90-degree angle with CD at point C. So, if I consider point C, then line CD goes off in some direction, and line CB is perpendicular to that. Now, point A lies on line CD. So point A is somewhere along the line that connects C and D. Wait, but how? Because PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(C, D)) means A is on line CD. But also, there's angle DAB mentioned. Hmm.

So let me try to visualize this. Points C and D are connected by a line. Point A is somewhere on that line. Then, there's point B such that line CB is perpendicular to CD. So, if I draw line CD, then at point C, there's a line CB going off perpendicularly. So, maybe B is above or below the line CD. Let me assume that CB is upward from CD for simplicity.

Now, angle DAB is given as 123 degrees. Angle DAB is the angle at point A between points D, A, B. So, since A is on line CD, DA is part of line CD. Then AB is connecting A to B. So, triangle DAB has vertex A on line CD, with DA being along CD, and AB forming some angle. The measure of that angle is 123 degrees.

Also, angle ABC (at point B between points A, B, C) equals angle 4. Our goal is to find the measure of angle 4, which is equal to angle ABC.

Hmm. Let me think about the relationships here. Since CB is perpendicular to CD, then angle BCD is 90 degrees. Wait, because CB and CD are perpendicular. So, at point C, angle between CB and CD is 90 degrees. Since point A is on line CD, then CA is a segment of CD. Therefore, triangle ABC has sides CB, BA, and AC. Wait, but point A is on CD, so AC is part of CD. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps considering coordinates would help. Maybe assigning coordinates to the points could make this easier. Let me try that approach.

Let me set up coordinate system. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0). Since line CD is horizontal for simplicity (since CB is vertical, as it's perpendicular to CD). Wait, if CB is perpendicular to CD, then if CD is horizontal, CB would be vertical. Let me assume CD is horizontal. So, line CD is horizontal. Let me assign coordinates:

Let’s say point C is at (0,0). Then line CD is horizontal. Let me take point D at (d, 0) for some d > 0. Then, since CB is perpendicular to CD, which is horizontal, CB must be vertical. So point B is somewhere along the vertical line through C. Let me suppose it's upwards, so point B is at (0, b) for some positive b.

But point A lies on line CD. So point A is somewhere on the x-axis (since CD is from (0,0) to (d, 0)). Let me denote point A as (a, 0), where a can be anywhere along the x-axis. However, depending on where A is, different angles will form.

Given that angle DAB is 123 degrees. Let me recall that angle DAB is at point A, between points D, A, B. So, vectors AD and AB. Let me compute that angle.

Coordinates:

- Point D: (d, 0)
- Point A: (a, 0)
- Point B: (0, b)

So vector AD is from A to D: D - A = (d - a, 0 - 0) = (d - a, 0)
Vector AB is from A to B: B - A = (0 - a, b - 0) = (-a, b)

The angle between vectors AD and AB is 123 degrees. So using the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (AD · AB) / (|AD| |AB|)

Compute the dot product:

AD · AB = (d - a)(-a) + (0)(b) = -a(d - a) + 0 = -ad + a²

|AD| = sqrt( (d - a)^2 + 0^2 ) = |d - a|

|AB| = sqrt( (-a)^2 + b^2 ) = sqrt(a² + b² )

Therefore,

cos(theta) = (-ad + a²) / ( |d - a| * sqrt(a² + b²) )

But theta is 123 degrees. However, without knowing specific values for a, d, b, this might not be straightforward. Perhaps there's another way.

Wait, but maybe we can relate angle ABC to angle 4. Since angle ABC is equal to angle 4. Let me think about triangle ABC. In triangle ABC, angle at B is angle ABC. Also, we know that CB is perpendicular to CD, so CB is vertical if CD is horizontal. Also, point A is on CD, so CA is along CD. Therefore, triangle ABC has a right angle at C? No, wait. Wait, CB is perpendicular to CD. Since CD is the line containing point A, then CB is perpendicular to CD. Therefore, CB is perpendicular to CA (since A is on CD). Therefore, triangle ABC has a right angle at C. Wait, because CB is perpendicular to CD, and CA is along CD. Therefore, angle at C between CB and CA is 90 degrees. Therefore, triangle ABC is a right triangle at C.

Ah! So triangle ABC is right-angled at C. Therefore, angle at C is 90 degrees. Therefore, angles at A and B sum to 90 degrees. Wait, but angle ABC is one of those angles. Wait, angle ABC is at point B. Let me clarify.

In triangle ABC, right-angled at C. So:

- Right angle at C.

Therefore, angles at A and B add up to 90 degrees. So angle at A (angle BAC) plus angle at B (angle ABC) equals 90 degrees.

But we need to find angle ABC, which is equal to angle 4. So if we can find angle ABC, that would give us the answer.

But how do we relate that to the given information about angle DAB being 123 degrees?

Let me think again. We have angle DAB = 123 degrees. Let me consider triangle DAB. Wait, point D is on line CD, point A is also on line CD, so DA is just a segment along CD. Then AB is connecting A to B. So angle DAB is formed at A between DA (along CD) and AB.

Since DA is along CD, which is horizontal in my coordinate system, and AB is a line from A to B. So angle between DA (horizontal) and AB is 123 degrees. Which is quite a large angle, more than 90 degrees. So that suggests that AB is going upwards from A, making an angle of 123 degrees with DA (which is towards D). So, in terms of coordinate system, if DA is pointing from A to D (assuming A is between C and D?), but depends on where A is located.

Wait, but point A could be anywhere on line CD. If A is between C and D, then DA would be from A to D, which is towards the right. If A is beyond D, then DA would be from A to D, which is towards the left. Similarly, if A is to the left of C, then DA would be towards the right.

This seems complicated. Maybe I need to use some relations between the triangles.

Alternatively, since triangle ABC is right-angled at C, then tan(angle ABC) = opposite over adjacent. In triangle ABC, angle at B is angle ABC. Let me think: in triangle ABC, right-angled at C, so:

tan(angle ABC) = opposite side / adjacent side. The opposite side to angle ABC is AC, and the adjacent side is BC. Wait, no. Wait, angle at B. In triangle ABC, right-angled at C. So sides:

- Opposite angle B: AC
- Adjacent to angle B: BC
- Hypotenuse AB

Wait, yes. So tan(angle ABC) = AC / BC.

But how does that relate to angle DAB?

Alternatively, maybe we can find some relationship between angle DAB and angle ABC. Let me think.

Angle DAB is 123 degrees. Let me consider triangle DAB. In triangle DAB, we have points D, A, B. Let me note that DA is along line CD, and AB connects A to B. Also, since CB is perpendicular to CD, then CB is perpendicular to DA (since DA is part of CD). So CB is perpendicular to DA. Therefore, CB is perpendicular to DA. So in triangle DAB, CB is an altitude? Not sure.

Wait, but point B is connected to C, which is on line CD. So CB is perpendicular to CD, hence to DA (since DA is on CD). Therefore, CB is perpendicular to DA. Therefore, CB is the height from point B to line DA. Wait, but DA is part of line CD. So, if I consider triangle DAB, then CB is perpendicular to DA. Therefore, the length of CB is the height from B to DA. But how does that help?

Alternatively, maybe using coordinates again. Let me assign coordinates as before:

Let me fix coordinates for clarity. Let me set point C at (0,0), line CD along x-axis, so D is at (d, 0). Point B is at (0, b) since CB is vertical (perpendicular to CD). Point A is somewhere on CD, so let me denote A as (a, 0).

Then, angle DAB is the angle at A between D and B. Let me calculate this angle.

Vectors AD and AB:

AD vector is from A to D: D - A = (d - a, 0)
AB vector is from A to B: B - A = (-a, b)

Earlier, we had the cosine of the angle between them as [(-ad + a²)] / [ |AD| * |AB| ]

Which simplifies to [a(a - d)] / [ |d - a| * sqrt(a² + b²) ] 

Note that |d - a| is |a - d|. So the numerator is a(a - d) = -a(d - a). Therefore:

cos(theta) = [ -a(d - a) ] / [ |d - a| * sqrt(...) ]

Assuming that a ≠ d (otherwise DA would be zero length). So, assuming a < d, then d - a is positive, so |d - a| = d - a. Then:

cos(theta) = [ -a(d - a) ] / [ (d - a) * sqrt(...) ] = -a / sqrt(a² + b²)

Therefore, cos(theta) = -a / sqrt(a² + b²)

But theta is angle DAB, which is 123 degrees. So:

cos(123°) = -a / sqrt(a² + b²)

Let me compute cos(123°). Cosine of 123 degrees is negative because 123° is in the second quadrant. Let me calculate its value:

cos(123°) ≈ cos(90° + 33°) = -sin(33°) ≈ -0.5446

So approximately -0.5446.

Thus:

-a / sqrt(a² + b²) ≈ -0.5446 → a / sqrt(a² + b²) ≈ 0.5446

Square both sides:

a² / (a² + b²) ≈ (0.5446)^2 ≈ 0.2966

Multiply both sides by denominator:

a² ≈ 0.2966(a² + b²)

Bring all terms to left:

a² - 0.2966a² - 0.2966b² ≈ 0 → 0.7034a² - 0.2966b² ≈ 0 → 0.7034a² ≈ 0.2966b² → Divide both sides by 0.2966:

(0.7034 / 0.2966)a² ≈ b² → Approximately 2.37a² ≈ b² → So b ≈ sqrt(2.37) a ≈ 1.54a

So, ratio of b/a ≈ 1.54. Let me keep that in mind.

Now, back to triangle ABC. Since triangle ABC is right-angled at C, so:

AC = distance from A to C: since A is at (a,0) and C is at (0,0), so AC = |a - 0| = |a|. Assuming a is to the right of C, which may not necessarily be true, but let's assume a > 0 for simplicity. So AC = a.

BC = distance from B to C: B is at (0,b), so BC = sqrt((0 - 0)^2 + (b - 0)^2) = b.

So in triangle ABC, right-angled at C, tan(angle ABC) = AC / BC = a / b.

From earlier, we have that b ≈ 1.54a → a/b ≈ 1/1.54 ≈ 0.649. So tan(angle ABC) ≈ 0.649. What angle has tangent ≈ 0.649?

Let me check tan(33°): tan(30°)=0.577, tan(35°)=0.700, so 0.649 is between 33° and 34°, closer to 33°. Let me calculate arctan(0.649):

Using calculator input: arctan(0.649) ≈ 33 degrees (exact value might vary slightly due to approximated b/a ratio).

But wait, our calculation was based on approximate numbers. Let me check more precisely.

We had earlier:

cos(theta) = -a / sqrt(a² + b²) = cos(123°) ≈ -0.5446

So, rearranged:

a / sqrt(a² + b²) = 0.5446

Let me square both sides:

a²/(a² + b²) = 0.5446² ≈ 0.2966

So,

a² = 0.2966(a² + b²)

Rearranged:

a² = 0.2966a² + 0.2966b² → a² - 0.2966a² = 0.2966b² → 0.7034a² = 0.2966b² → divide both sides by 0.2966:

(0.7034 / 0.2966) a² = b² → let me compute 0.7034 / 0.2966 ≈ 2.37

So b² = 2.37a² → b = a√2.37 ≈ a*1.54

So tan(angle ABC) = a / b = 1 / √2.37 ≈ 1 / 1.54 ≈ 0.649.

As before. Now, let me compute arctangent of 0.649.

If I use a calculator, arctan(0.649) is approximately... Well, tan(33°) is approximately 0.6494. Yes! Exactly. Because tan(33°) ≈ 0.6494. So angle ABC is approximately 33 degrees. Hence, angle 4 is 33 degrees. Looking at the answer choices, option A is 33.

But wait, let me confirm once again. Is there a possibility of error in my assumption that a is positive? Suppose point A is to the left of C, meaning a is negative. Then AC would be |a|, but the previous equations still hold? Let me check.

Suppose a is negative. Then DA vector would be (d - a, 0). If a is negative, then d - a is larger, but the calculation for cos(theta) would still be -a / sqrt(...). If a is negative, then -a becomes positive. For example, if a = -k (k>0), then cos(theta) = k / sqrt(k² + b²). Which would be positive, implying that angle DAB is acute. But angle DAB is given as 123°, which is obtuse. So in that case, the cosine would be negative, which would require that -a / ... is negative. So if a is negative, then -a is positive, leading to positive cosine, which contradicts the fact that angle is 123°, which has negative cosine. Therefore, a must be positive. Therefore, our initial assumption holds, and angle ABC is approximately 33 degrees. Thus, the answer should be A. 33.

But let me check whether there's another way to get this result without coordinates. Let me think again.

Since triangle ABC is right-angled at C, angle ABC + angle BAC = 90°. So angle ABC = 90° - angle BAC.

Now, angle BAC is the angle at A in triangle ABC. Let me find that angle. How is angle BAC related to angle DAB?

Angle DAB is the angle between DA and AB. DA is along line CD, which is same as line CA extended (since A is on CD). Wait, if DA is from A to D, then DA is along CD. So angle between DA (which is in direction from A to D) and AB is 123°, which is angle DAB.

But angle BAC is the angle between BA and CA. Since CA is from A to C, which is opposite to DA. So DA is from A to D, which is in the direction away from C. Whereas CA is from A to C, towards C. So DA and CA are in opposite directions. So angle between DA and AB is 123°, while angle between CA and AB is something else.

Let me visualize: At point A, DA is going towards D (away from C), and CA is going towards C (opposite direction). So angle between DA and AB is 123°, which is external to triangle ABC. The angle between CA and AB is angle BAC, which is internal to triangle ABC.

These two angles (DA-AB and CA-AB) are supplementary if they form a linear pair. Wait, because DA and CA are in opposite directions. So if you look at angle between DA and AB (which is 123°) and angle between CA and AB, they add up to 180°, since DA and CA are opposite directions. Therefore:

angle DAB + angle BAC = 180°

So angle BAC = 180° - 123° = 57°

Then, since in triangle ABC, angle ABC + angle BAC = 90°, as it's a right triangle at C:

angle ABC = 90° - angle BAC = 90° - 57° = 33°

Oh! This is much simpler. So angle ABC is 33 degrees, which is equal to angle 4. Therefore, answer is A. 33.

Wow, that's a better way without coordinates. By realizing that angle DAB and angle BAC are supplementary, since DA and CA are colinear but opposite directions. Therefore, their respective angles with AB add up to 180 degrees. Hence, angle BAC = 180 - 123 = 57°, then angle ABC = 90 - 57 = 33°. So answer is A.

That makes sense. So regardless of the coordinate system, this relation holds. Therefore, the correct answer is A. 33 degrees.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $ \angle 4 $, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration described in the problem and applying key principles of triangle geometry and angle relationships.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Given Constraints**

We are told the following:

- $ \text{MeasureOf}(\angle ABC) = \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 4) $
- $ \text{MeasureOf}(\angle DAB) = 123^\circ $
- $ \text{PointLiesOnLine}(A, \text{Line}(C, D)) $ — so point $ A $ lies on line $ CD $
- $ \text{Perpendicular}(\text{Line}(C, B), \text{Line}(C, D)) $ — so lines $ CB $ and $ CD $ are perpendicular

This implies that triangle $ ABC $ is **right-angled** at point $ C $, since $ CB \perp CD $ and $ A $ lies on line $ CD $. Therefore, $ \angle ACB = 90^\circ $.

---

### **Step 2: Use Angle Relationships in Triangle $ ABC $**

In triangle $ ABC $, since it is right-angled at $ C $, the remaining two angles, $ \angle BAC $ and $ \angle ABC $, must satisfy:

$$
\angle BAC + \angle ABC = 90^\circ
$$

Our goal is to find $ \angle ABC $, which is equal to $ \angle 4 $.

---

### **Step 3: Analyze $ \angle DAB $ and Its Relationship with $ \angle BAC $**

We are given that $ \angle DAB = 123^\circ $. Note that:

- $ \overrightarrow{DA} $ and $ \overrightarrow{CA} $ lie on the same straight line (line $ CD $), but in opposite directions.
- So, the angle between $ \overrightarrow{DA} $ and $ \overrightarrow{AB} $ (i.e., $ \angle DAB $) is **supplementary** to the angle between $ \overrightarrow{CA} $ and $ \overrightarrow{AB} $ (i.e., $ \angle BAC $).

This gives:

$$
\angle DAB + \angle BAC = 180^\circ
$$

Substitute known value:

$$
123^\circ + \angle BAC = 180^\circ \Rightarrow \angle BAC = 180^\circ - 123^\circ = 57^\circ
$$

---

### **Step 4: Compute $ \angle ABC $ Using Triangle Angle Sum**

Recall from Step 2 that:

$$
\angle BAC + \angle ABC = 90^\circ
$$

Substitute $ \angle BAC = 57^\circ $:

$$
57^\circ + \angle ABC = 90^\circ \Rightarrow \angle ABC = 90^\circ - 57^\circ = 33^\circ
$$

Thus, $ \angle ABC = 33^\circ $, and since $ \angle ABC = \angle 4 $, we conclude:

$$
m\angle 4 = 33^\circ
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\text{Final Answer: A}}
