MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, and C. The given information is that the length of line AC is 16 units, and the length of line BC is 10 units. Also, angle at point B (angle ABC) is denoted as x. Additionally, it says that lines CB and CA are perpendicular. Wait, hold on—perpendicular means they form a right angle. Let me visualize this.

First, I need to sketch the scenario. Since lines CB and CA are perpendicular, that would mean that at point C, the two lines CB and CA meet at a right angle. Wait, but the angle mentioned is angle ABC, which is at point B. Hmm, maybe I should clarify the configuration.

Wait, the angle is at point B, so angle ABC. That means vertex at B, with segments BA and BC forming the angle. But the problem states that lines CB and CA are perpendicular. Wait, line CB is from point C to B, and line CA is from point C to A. So those two lines intersect at point C, and they're perpendicular. Therefore, triangle ABC has a right angle at point C? Because lines CB and CA are perpendicular, meaning that angle at C is 90 degrees. Wait, but angle ABC is the angle at B. So, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at C?

Let me confirm. If lines CB and CA are perpendicular, then the angle between them is 90 degrees. Since both lines start at point C, that makes angle ACB a right angle. So triangle ABC is right-angled at C. Therefore, sides AC and BC are the legs, and AB is the hypotenuse.

Given that AC = 16, BC = 10. Then, using Pythagoras theorem, AB² = AC² + BC² = 16² + 10². Let me compute that:

16 squared is 256, 10 squared is 100. Sum is 356. So AB = sqrt(356). Simplify sqrt(356)... Well, 356 factors into 4*89, since 4*89=356. So sqrt(4*89)=2*sqrt(89). Not sure if needed yet.

But the question asks for angle x, which is angle ABC. In triangle ABC, right-angled at C. So angle at B is x. To find x, perhaps use trigonometry. In a right-angled triangle, tangent of angle B equals opposite over adjacent. Opposite side to angle B is AC (since angle at B, opposite side is AC), and adjacent side is BC.

Wait, no. Let me think again. In triangle ABC, right-angled at C. So angles at A and B are acute. For angle at B (x), the sides relative to angle B: the opposite side is AC, and the adjacent side is BC. Wait, no. Let me recall SOHCAHTOA.

Opposite over Hypotenuse is sine, adjacent over hypotenuse is cosine, opposite over adjacent is tangent.

So tan(x) = opposite / adjacent. Here, angle at B: the opposite side is AC (which is 16), and the adjacent side is BC (which is 10). Wait, no. Wait, in triangle ABC, angle at B. The sides:

- Opposite to angle B is AC. Because angle B is at vertex B; the side opposite is AC.

- Adjacent to angle B is BC. Because angle B is formed by sides AB and BC. Wait, adjacent side would be BC, which is connected to angle B. Wait, actually, in terms of the right angle being at C, the legs are AC and BC. So angle at B is between BC and AB. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe using trigonometric ratios. Let me draw triangle ABC with right angle at C. So, vertices at C (right angle), A, and B. So sides:

AC = 16 (from A to C)

BC = 10 (from B to C)

AB is the hypotenuse.

Then, angle at B is x. So in triangle ABC, angle at B, adjacent side is BC (length 10), opposite side is AC (length 16). Wait, no. Wait, if you consider angle at B, then the sides relative to angle B are:

- The side opposite angle B is AC.

- The side adjacent to angle B is BC.

Therefore, tan(x) = opposite / adjacent = AC / BC = 16 / 10 = 1.6.

So x = arctangent(1.6). Let me calculate that value.

Calculating arctan(1.6). Let me convert that into degrees. Since I don't remember exact values, but I can approximate.

I know that tan(58°) ≈ 1.6003... because tan(58°) is approximately 1.6003. Let me check that. Yes, tan(58°) is roughly 1.6003. Which matches our ratio of 16/10 = 1.6.

Therefore, angle x is approximately 58 degrees. Looking at the answer choices, option C is 58. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me verify once more. Maybe there's a mistake in identifying the opposite and adjacent sides.

Alternative approach: Use coordinates. Let's place point C at origin (0,0). Since AC and BC are perpendicular. Suppose AC is along y-axis, and BC along x-axis. So point C is at (0,0). Point A is somewhere along y-axis: since AC = 16, so A is at (0,16). Point B is along x-axis: BC = 10, so B is at (10, 0).

Now, angle at B is angle ABC. Let's find coordinates:

Point B is at (10,0), point C is at (0,0), point A is at (0,16). So vector BA goes from B to A: (0-10, 16-0) = (-10, 16). Vector BC goes from B to C: (0-10, 0-0) = (-10, 0). Wait, but angle at B is between BA and BC. Wait, angle ABC is the angle at point B between points A, B, and C.

So vectors BA and BB? No, vectors BA and BC. Wait, angle at B is between BA and BC. Wait, BA is from B to A, and BC is from B to C. So vectors BA and BC emanate from point B.

Vector BA is A - B: (0 - 10, 16 - 0) = (-10, 16)

Vector BC is C - B: (0 - 10, 0 - 0) = (-10, 0)

To find angle between these two vectors, we can use the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (BA · BC) / (|BA| |BC| )

Compute BA · BC: (-10)(-10) + (16)(0) = 100 + 0 = 100

|BA| = sqrt((-10)^2 + 16^2) = sqrt(100 + 256) = sqrt(356) ≈ 18.87

|BC| = sqrt((-10)^2 + 0^2) = 10

Thus cos(theta) = 100 / (sqrt(356)*10) ) = 10 / sqrt(356)

Simplify sqrt(356): as before, sqrt(4*89) = 2*sqrt(89), so denominator becomes 2*sqrt(89)

So cos(theta) = 10/(2√89) = 5/√89 ≈ 5 / 9.433 ≈ 0.5303

Now, take arccos(0.5303). Let me calculate that. Cos(58°) is approx 0.5299. So theta ≈ 58 degrees. Hence, x ≈ 58°, which matches option C.

Therefore, the correct answer is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The problem involves a right-angled triangle $ \triangle ABC $ with a right angle at $ C $, given that $ AC = 16 $, $ BC = 10 $, and angle $ ABC = x $. 

### Step-by-Step Solution:
1. **Identify Triangle Configuration**:
   - The condition $ \text{Perpendicular}(Line(C,B), Line(C,A)) $ implies that angle $ ACB $ is $ 90^\circ $, making $ \triangle ABC $ a right-angled triangle at $ C $.

2. **Apply Trigonometry**:
   - In a right-angled triangle, the tangent of an angle is the ratio of the lengths of the opposite and adjacent sides.
   - For angle $ x $ at $ B $, the opposite side is $ AC = 16 $, and the adjacent side is $ BC = 10 $.
   - Thus, $ \tan(x) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{16}{10} = 1.6 $.

3. **Calculate Angle $ x $**:
   - Using a calculator or known values, $ \arctan(1.6) \approx 58^\circ $.

4. **Verification via Coordinates**:
   - Placing $ C $ at the origin $(0,0)$, $ A $ at $(0,16)$, and $ B $ at $(10,0)$, the vectors $ \vec{BA} = (-10, 16) $ and $ \vec{BC} = (-10, 0) $ yield a dot product calculation confirming $ \cos(\theta) \approx 0.5303 $, corresponding to $ \theta \approx 58^\circ $.
