MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points J, F, G, H all lying on a circle centered at point B with radius 3.0. Also, there's a line segment between J and H that has the same length as the line segment between F and G. The angles at point B—specifically angle HBJ and angle FBG—are given as x and 70 degrees respectively. We need to find x.

First, since all these points (J, F, G, H) lie on a circle centered at B, that means they're all equidistant from B. The radius is 3.0, so BJ = BF = BG = BH = 3.0 units. That makes triangle BFG, BGF, etc., all isosceles triangles because two sides are equal (the radii). Wait, but actually each pair of points connected to B would form an isosceles triangle. For example, triangle BFG has sides BF and BG equal, so it's isosceles with base FG. Similarly for triangle BJK? Wait, no, maybe I should think about the arcs or central angles here.

The key thing here might be the central angles corresponding to the chords FH and FG. Because the chord lengths are related to the central angles. Since the chord length depends on the central angle subtended by the chord. The formula for chord length is 2r sin(theta/2), where theta is the central angle and r is the radius.

Given that the chord lengths JH and FG are equal. Let me write that down:

Length of JH = Length of FG.

So using the chord length formula:

For chord JH: 2 * r * sin(angle JBH / 2)

Similarly, for chord FG: 2 * r * sin(angle FBG / 2)

Since JH and FG are equal, their chord lengths are equal. Therefore,

sin(angle JBH / 2) = sin(angle FBG / 2)

But wait, angle JBH is the central angle for chord JH, which is x degrees (since angle HBJ is x). And angle FBG is given as 70 degrees.

Wait, hold on. Let me clarify the notation. The measure of angle HBJ is x. So angle at point B between points H and J. That is, angle HBJ is the central angle between points H and J. Similarly, angle FBG is the central angle between points F and G. So those are the central angles corresponding to chords HJ and FG.

Therefore, the chord length JH corresponds to central angle x, and chord FG corresponds to central angle 70 degrees. Since the chord lengths are equal, then:

Chord length JH = 2r sin(x/2)

Chord length FG = 2r sin(70°/2) = 2r sin(35°)

Set them equal:

2r sin(x/2) = 2r sin(35°)

Divide both sides by 2r:

sin(x/2) = sin(35°)

So, solving for x/2, we get that x/2 could be 35°, or 180° - 35° = 145°, since sine is positive in first and second quadrants.

Thus, x/2 = 35° => x=70°, or x/2=145° => x=290°, but since angles in a circle can't be more than 180° unless considering reflex angles. But in standard geometric problems, central angles are typically considered as the smaller arc between two points, so less than 180°. However, if x were 290°, that would imply a reflex angle, which may not make sense here. But maybe there's another way to look at it.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are supplementary? Let me think again. If the chord lengths are equal, then their central angles must either be equal or supplementary. Wait, no. Chord length depends on the sine of half the central angle. So if sin(a) = sin(b), then a = b + 360n or a = 180 - b + 360n. But since angles are between 0 and 360, possible solutions for a and b within that range.

But in our case, the central angles x and 70°, so x/2 and 35°, so solving sin(x/2)=sin(35°). So possible solutions are x/2=35°, leading to x=70°, or x/2=180-35=145°, leading to x=290°. However, 290° is larger than 180°, which would mean that the central angle is reflex. But in most cases, when dealing with circles, especially in problems like this, central angles refer to the smaller arc between two points. Hence, x would be 70°, but wait, that's the same as the angle given for FBG. But that seems odd. Wait, but if x was 70°, then the chords JH and FG would have the same length, which matches the condition. But why would that be?

Wait, but maybe there's something else. Let me check again. Suppose that angle HBJ is x, which is the central angle between H and J. Then the chord JH has central angle x. Similarly, angle FBG is 70°, central angle between F and G. So chord FG has central angle 70°. Therefore, chord lengths are equal implies that the central angles are either equal or supplementary? No, because chord length depends on sin(theta/2). So if sin(theta1/2)=sin(theta2/2), then theta1/2 = theta2/2 + 360n or theta1/2 = 180 - theta2/2 + 360n. Thus, theta1 = theta2 + 720n or theta1 = 360 - theta2 + 720n. Considering n=0, possible solutions are theta1=theta2 or theta1=360-theta2. But theta1 and theta2 are central angles, so they are between 0 and 360. However, for typical problems, central angles are considered as the smaller arc, so between 0 and 180. So if theta1=360-theta2, then theta1 would be greater than 180 if theta2 < 180. So if theta1 is supposed to be the smaller arc, then theta1=theta2 or theta1=360-theta2, but only if theta1 is less than 180. 

In our case, the chord FG corresponds to central angle 70°, which is already less than 180. So the chord JH must correspond to either 70° or 360-70=290°. But since 290° is a reflex angle, which would correspond to the major arc. But if we take the minor arc, then the central angle is 70°, meaning x=70°, which is the same as the given angle. But that would imply that angle HBJ is also 70°, making chord JH equal to FG. But that's possible. But then why would the problem give us that information? Because if x is 70°, then that would directly satisfy the condition. But let me check if there's another possibility.

Wait, but maybe the chords JH and FG are not necessarily the minor arcs. Maybe the problem allows for major arcs. But even then, the chord length depends on the minor arc. Because the chord length is determined by the shorter arc between the two points. So regardless of whether you take the minor or major arc, the chord length is the same. Because the chord length is based on the minimal distance between two points on the circle. So, for example, even if the central angle is 290°, the actual chord length would be the same as if the central angle was 70°, because the chord length depends on the smaller arc. Therefore, the equation sin(x/2)=sin(35°) gives x/2=35° or x/2=145°, so x=70° or x=290°. But since x is an angle in a triangle or a diagram, it's likely that it's less than 180°, so x=70°. But wait, that would make angle HBJ equal to angle FBG, both being 70°, but then why is the problem giving us that information? Or am I missing something here?

Wait, but maybe there's another relationship. Let me consider the positions of the points. All four points J, F, G, H are on the circle around B. Are there any other constraints? The problem says that the length of JH equals the length of FG. So, chord JH equals chord FG. Which leads us back to the previous conclusion that their central angles are either equal or supplementary. But since the chord lengths depend on the sine of half the central angle, which is symmetric around 180°, so the chord length is the same for central angles θ and 360−θ. However, in terms of the angle itself, θ is the central angle, so if θ is 70°, then 360−70=290°, but that's a reflex angle. However, the chord length remains the same. Therefore, the central angle could be 70° or 290°, but since we usually consider the smaller arc, it's 70°, hence x=70°, which would be option C. But wait, looking at the answer choices, option C is 70, but that's the same as the given angle for FBG. Is that possible?

But maybe there's another approach. Let me visualize this. Points J, F, G, H are on a circle centered at B. Let me imagine the circle with center B. Let me draw lines from B to each of these points. Now, angle HBJ is x, so points H and J are separated by an arc corresponding to x degrees. Similarly, points F and G are separated by 70 degrees. The chords JH and FG have equal lengths. So, since chord length depends on the central angle, then the central angles for JH and FG must be equal or supplementary. But since the chord lengths are equal, their central angles must be equal or supplementary. Wait, but earlier analysis shows that their sines are equal, leading to possible angles. But if the central angles are equal, then x=70°, which is the same as the given angle. Alternatively, if they are supplementary, then the central angle for JH would be 180 - 70 = 110°, so x=110°, but that's not among the answer choices. Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Hold on, chord length is 2r sin(theta/2). So if two chords are equal, then their respective central angles must satisfy sin(theta1/2)=sin(theta2/2). This leads to theta1/2 = theta2/2 + 360k or theta1/2 = 180 - theta2/2 + 360k. Therefore, theta1 = theta2 + 720k or theta1 = 360 - theta2 + 720k. So for k=0, theta1 = theta2 or theta1 = 360 - theta2. But theta1 and theta2 are central angles between 0 and 360. 

If theta1 = theta2, then x = 70°, which is possible. If theta1 = 360 - theta2, then x = 360 - 70 = 290°, but that's a reflex angle. However, in standard problems, central angles are taken as the smaller arc, so 70°, which would mean x=70°. But that's the same as the given angle. But then why does the problem mention the equality of the chords? It seems redundant. Unless there's another interpretation.

Wait, maybe I got the central angles wrong. Let me re-express. The measure of angle HBJ is x. That angle is at point B, between points H and J. So that is indeed the central angle between H and J. Similarly, angle FBG is 70°, which is the central angle between F and G. So the chord lengths JH and FG are equal, so their central angles must be equal or supplementary. But since the chord lengths are equal, their central angles must be equal or supplementary. Wait, but how does that relate to the sine function?

Let me think again. If two chords are equal, their central angles must be equal or supplementary. Wait, is that true? Let me check. Suppose two chords AB and CD are equal in length. Then the central angles for AB and CD must be equal. Because chord length depends on the central angle. So if two chords are congruent, their central angles are congruent. Therefore, in this case, chord JH and FG are congruent, so their central angles must be equal. Hence, x = 70°, which would make angle HBJ equal to angle FBG. But that seems too straightforward. However, the answer choice C is 70. But then why is this problem presented as non-trivial? There must be something wrong here.

Alternatively, perhaps the central angles are not the ones I thought. Let me double-check the angle measures. Angle HBJ is formed at point B, so vertex at B, with segments BH and BJ. So yes, that's the central angle between points H and J. Similarly, angle FBG is at point B, between points F and G. So those are central angles. Therefore, if their chords are equal, their central angles must be equal. Therefore, x=70°, so answer C. But why is the problem giving this? Maybe there's a trick here. Wait, but maybe the chords JH and FG are not the direct chords but something else?

Wait, the problem states that the length of line JH equals the length of line FG. So JH and FG are straight line segments connecting those points. So that is the chord length. Therefore, the central angles must be equal. Hence, x=70°, so answer C. But then why is the answer not C? Wait, but looking at the answer choices, option C is 70. But let me think again—if the central angles are equal, then yes, but what if the points are arranged such that the chords are not the direct arcs? Like, maybe JH spans an arc that's different from FG? Hmm, no. Because chord length uniquely determines the central angle. So if two chords are equal, their central angles are equal. Therefore, x must equal 70°, so answer C.

But maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Let me think about another possibility. What if the points are placed such that the chords JH and FG are not the minor arcs but major arcs? For example, suppose that the central angle for JH is 290°, which would make the chord length the same as 70°, because 290° is equivalent to -70°, but sine is periodic. However, in that case, the central angle would be 290°, so x=290°, which isn't among the answer choices. So that can't be. Therefore, the only valid solution is x=70°, which is option C.

Wait, but then why is the problem asking for x? It seems like it's just restating the given angle. Unless there's some other constraint I'm missing. Let me go back to the original problem statement.

Wait, the problem says: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(H, B, J)), x). So angle at B between H and J. And Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(F, B, G)), 70). So angle at B between F and G. So those are two separate angles. So if the chords JH and FG are equal, then their central angles are equal. So x=70°, so answer C. But that feels too easy. Maybe I missed something else?

Wait, perhaps the diagram is not showing the points in order? For instance, maybe points H and J are arranged such that the angle HBJ is not the minor arc but something else. But without a diagram, we can't know. However, in standard problems, angles at the center are considered as the smallest possible angle between the two radii. So angle HBJ is the smaller angle between BH and BJ, so x is between 0 and 180°. Hence, x=70°, which would make the chord JH equal in length to FG, which has central angle 70°, so that works.

But why would the problem include all this information if it's so straightforward? Perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning. Let me verify with an example. Suppose the circle has radius r. Let’s say the central angle for JH is x, so chord length is 2r*sin(x/2). The central angle for FG is 70°, so chord length is 2r*sin(35°). Setting them equal: sin(x/2) = sin(35°). Solutions are x/2 = 35° => x=70°, or x/2=145° => x=290°. But since x is an angle in a geometric figure, probably less than 180°, so x=70°. So answer C.

But then, the problem is trivial. But maybe the answer is different? Let me check if there's another approach. Suppose the points are arranged such that angle HBJ is x, and angle FBG is 70°, but the chords JH and FG are equal. Maybe there's a relation between these angles through some triangle or something else. For example, maybe triangles involving these points?

Alternatively, maybe the points are arranged in such a way that the angles x and 70° are part of a larger configuration. For example, if points F, G, H, J are arranged around the circle in some order, creating overlapping angles. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to tell. However, the problem doesn't specify any other relationships, so we can assume that the only constraints are the ones given.

Another idea: Could the fact that all points are on the circle with center B mean that certain triangles are congruent or similar? For example, triangles BFG and B...? Well, triangle BFG has sides BF=BG=r, so it's isosceles with base FG. Similarly, triangle BHJ has sides BH=BJ=r, so it's isosceles with base JH. Since FG=JH, then the bases of these isosceles triangles are equal. Therefore, the apex angles of these triangles (which are the angles at B) would be equal. Because in an isosceles triangle, the apex angle relates to the base length. Specifically, the base angles are equal, and the apex angle is determined by the base length.

Wait, in triangle BFG, the apex angle is angle FBG=70°, and the base is FG. In triangle BHJ, the apex angle is angle HBJ=x, and the base is JH. Since FG=JH, then the apex angles must be equal? No, that's not necessarily true. Because the apex angle in an isosceles triangle depends on the base length. For example, if the base is longer, the apex angle is smaller, and vice versa. So if FG=JH, then the apex angles would be equal. Wait, that's contradictory to the earlier conclusion. Wait, let me think carefully.

In an isosceles triangle, the apex angle is opposite the base. The length of the base depends on the apex angle. For example, if you have two sides of length r (BF and BG), and base FG. The length of FG depends on the apex angle at B. Similarly for JH. So if FG=JH, then the apex angles must be equal. Because the base length is determined by the apex angle. Hence, angle FBG = angle HBJ. So x=70°, which confirms our previous conclusion. Therefore, answer is C.

But then why is this question included? It seems straightforward. But maybe the answer is different. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me do a calculation with numbers. Let's take r=3.0.

Suppose angle FBG=70°, so the base FG has length 2*3*sin(70°/2) = 6*sin(35°). Similarly, for angle HBJ=x, the base JH has length 6*sin(x/2). Setting equal:

6*sin(x/2) = 6*sin(35°) → sin(x/2)=sin(35°).

Which gives x/2=35° or 145°, so x=70° or 290°. As before. Since x must be between 0° and 180°, x=70°. So answer C.

But maybe the problem considers that the angle HBJ is not the central angle, but something else? Like, if points H and J are not on the same side of BF or something? No, the problem states that all points are on the circle centered at B, so all angles at B are central angles. So this seems solid.

But then why is the answer not C? Wait, looking at the answer choices, option C is 70. So according to this, answer is C. But let me check if there's any chance that the problem involves inscribed angles instead of central angles. Wait, no. The angle at B is between two radii, so it's definitely a central angle. Inscribed angles would be at other points.

So, after thorough consideration, I think the correct answer is C, 70°. But let me check once more. If x=70°, then angle HBJ=70°, and angle FBG=70°, which makes the chords JH and FG equal. So everything checks out. Hence, the answer is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we begin by analyzing the geometric setup described in the problem. Here's the logical breakdown:

---

### **Key Observations and Constraints**

1. **Points on a Circle**:  
   Points $ J, F, G, H $ all lie on a circle centered at point $ B $, with radius $ r = 3.0 $. This means:
   $$
   BJ = BF = BG = BH = 3.0
   $$

2. **Central Angles and Chords**:  
   The angles mentioned — specifically $ \angle HBJ = x $ and $ \angle FBG = 70^\circ $ — are **central angles** formed by the radii $ BH $ and $ BJ $, and $ BF $ and $ BG $, respectively.

   These central angles define the **chords** $ JH $ and $ FG $, whose endpoints lie on the circumference of the circle.

3. **Equal Chord Lengths**:  
   The problem explicitly states that the lengths of segments $ JH $ and $ FG $ are equal:
   $$
   |JH| = |FG|
   $$

   Since chord length depends on the central angle subtending it, we use the chord-length formula:
   $$
   \text{Chord Length} = 2r \cdot \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
   $$
   where $ r $ is the radius and $ \theta $ is the central angle.

---

### **Setting Up the Equation**

Using the chord-length formula for both chords:

- Chord $ JH $ subtends central angle $ x $, so its length is:
  $$
  L_{JH} = 2 \cdot 3.0 \cdot \sin\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)
  $$

- Chord $ FG $ subtends central angle $ 70^\circ $, so its length is:
  $$
  L_{FG} = 2 \cdot 3.0 \cdot \sin\left(\frac{70^\circ}{2}\right) = 6 \cdot \sin(35^\circ)
  $$

Equating the two lengths:

$$
2 \cdot 3.0 \cdot \sin\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 6 \cdot \sin(35^\circ)
$$

Canceling the common factor of 6:

$$
\sin\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = \sin(35^\circ)
$$

---

### **Solving the Trigonometric Equation**

We now solve:
$$
\sin\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = \sin(35^\circ)
$$

This equation has two general solutions:
- $ \frac{x}{2} = 35^\circ $
- $ \frac{x}{2} = 180^\circ - 35^\circ = 145^\circ $

Multiplying both possibilities by 2:

- $ x = 70^\circ $
- $ x = 290^\circ $

However, since $ x $ represents a central angle in a circle and all points are on the circle, we consider only the **acute or obtuse central angle**, i.e., values less than or equal to $ 180^\circ $. Thus, the only feasible solution is:

$$
x = 70^\circ
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

All conditions are satisfied when $ x = 70^\circ $, confirming that the measure of $ \angle HBJ $ is equal to the measure of $ \angle FBG $, which aligns with the given equal chord lengths.

---

**Final Answer: C**  
$$
\boxed{C}
$$
