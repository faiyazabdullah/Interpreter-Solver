====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have some angle measures and relationships given here. Let me start by breaking down the information step by step.

First, the problem says that ∠6 and ∠8 are complementary. That means their measures add up to 90 degrees. And it also tells us that the measure of ∠8 is 47 degrees. Wait, so if they're complementary, then ∠6 + ∠8 = 90°. Since ∠8 is 47°, then ∠6 should be 90° - 47°, which is 43°. Let me note that down: ∠6 = 43°, ∠8 = 47°.

Now, the question asks for the measure of ∠7. The given constraints mention several angle equalities. Let me parse those again:

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C, B, EA)), MeasureOf(Angle(6))) → So, ∠EBA (assuming Angle(C,B,EA) refers to angle at point B between points C, B, E and A? Wait, maybe I need to visualize the diagram. But since there's no diagram, I'll have to infer based on the labels.

Wait, the angles mentioned are:

Angle(C, B, EA): This notation might mean the angle at point B formed by points C, B, and E? Wait, but the third point is EA. Maybe it's angle at B between lines BC and BE? Or perhaps angle at point E? Wait, the standard notation for an angle is usually the middle letter as the vertex. So Angle(C, B, EA) would be angle at point B, with segments going to C and E? Wait, EA might be a line segment from E to A. Hmm, maybe the angle is at point B, with sides going to C and A? Wait, the notation can be confusing without a diagram.

But given that there's another angle mentioned: Angle(E, B, A), which would be angle at point B between E and A. So that's angle EBA. Similarly, Angle(D, B, A) would be angle at point B between D and A, so angle DBA.

So, the first equality says that measure of angle at B between C and E (maybe angle EBC?) equals measure of angle 6. Then, measure of angle EBA equals measure of angle 7. And measure of angle DBA equals measure of angle 8.

Also, Point LIES ON LINE (B, Line(C,D)). So point B lies on line CD? Wait, no: "PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(C, D))" meaning that point B is on the line connecting C and D. So, points C, B, D are colinear? Because B is on line CD. Therefore, points C, B, D are on a straight line. So BD is a straight line passing through B, with C and D on opposite sides of B?

Let me try to sketch mentally. Points C, B, D are colinear, so CB and BD form a straight line. So, if I imagine a straight line with points C---B---D. Now, point A is somewhere else, connected to B. Also, there's point E involved, because of angle EBA and others.

Given that, let's think about angles around point B. Since B is on line CD, then angles involving B and points on that line would relate to straight lines.

So, considering angle DBA (which is equal to angle 8, which is 47°). Since D, B, C are colinear, then angle DBA is part of the straight line. Wait, angle DBA is at point B between D and A. If you imagine BA making some angle with BD. Similarly, angle EBA is at point B between E and A. And angle EBC (from the first equality) is equal to angle 6 (43°).

Wait, let me clarify:

The first constraint: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C, B, EA)), MeasureOf(Angle(6))). Let me parse Angle(C, B, EA). The vertex is B, with sides going to C and to EA. Wait, EA is a segment from E to A. So maybe the angle is at B between points C and E? Or maybe between C and A? Wait, the notation could be ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps it's angle at point E? No, the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(C, B, EA) would be the angle at point B between points C and E, but EA is a segment from E to A. Wait, perhaps the angle is at point B between EC and BA? Not sure. Maybe it's better to consider that the angle is formed by points C, B, and A, but with E being part of something else. Wait, this is getting too confusing without a diagram.

Alternatively, maybe the notation Angle(X, Y, Z) represents the angle at Y between X and Z. So, Angle(C, B, EA) would be the angle at B between C and EA. But EA is a single point? Wait, maybe it's a typo and supposed to be Angle(C, B, A)? Or maybe there's a missing point. Alternatively, maybe it's Angle(C, B, E) and A is another point? This is unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps Angle(C, B, EA) is meant to represent angle at B between points C and E, with A being another point? Maybe there's a misformatting here. Given that, maybe it's angle EBC? For example, if the angle is at B between E and C. Then, that would make sense. So, if that angle is equal to angle 6 (which we found to be 43°). Then, angle EBC = 43°, and angle EBA = angle 7, and angle DBA = angle 8 = 47°.

Assuming that, then let's proceed.

Since points C, B, D are colinear, then angle CBD is a straight angle, 180°. So, if we look at angles around point B. Let's suppose that BA is a ray starting at B and going to A. Then, angle between BA and BD (which is along DC) is angle DBA = 47°, as per the third constraint. Also, angle between BA and BE is angle EBA = angle 7. And angle between BE and BC is angle EBC = angle 6 = 43°.

Wait, but if points C, B, D are colinear, then BC and BD are in opposite directions. So, if we consider angle EBC (at point B between E and C), and angle EBA (at point B between E and A), then these two angles might be adjacent, forming a larger angle.

Wait, let me think. Suppose BA is a ray from B. Then, if angle EBA is angle between EB and BA, and angle EBC is angle between EB and BC. Since BC is in the direction towards C, which is on the line through B and D. So, if I imagine BA going off in some direction, and EB making some angle with BA and BC.

Alternatively, maybe the sum of angles around point B related to line CD.

If angle DBA is 47°, and angle EBC is 43°, then depending on how the points are arranged, these angles could be adjacent or supplementary.

Wait, let me try to imagine that line CD passes through B. So, if we have BA making an angle of 47° with BD (since angle DBA is 47°). Also, angle EBC is 43°, which is the angle between EB and BC. Since BC is in the opposite direction of BD (as B is between C and D), then BC is opposite to BD.

Therefore, if we consider the straight line CD through B, then angles on either side of BD would add up to 180°.

Suppose that EB is a line from B, creating angles with BC and BA. So, angle EBC is 43°, and angle EBA is angle 7. Depending on the position of E, these angles could be adjacent.

For instance, if E is positioned such that BE splits the angle between BA and BC. Wait, but BA makes an angle of 47° with BD (which is the same line as BC extended beyond B to D). So, if BA is making a 47° angle with BD (which goes towards D), then the direction of BA is such that when you go from BD to BA, it's a 47° turn.

Meanwhile, angle EBC is 43°, which is the angle between BE and BC. Since BC is in the direction opposite to BD, then BE is making a 43° angle with BC, which would correspond to an angle of 180° - 43° = 137° relative to BD?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the total angles around point B.

At point B, the line CD passes through it, so angles on one side of CD would be related to the other side. Suppose BA is a line from B, and BE is another line from B. Then, angle between BA and BD is 47°, and angle between BE and BC is 43°. Since BC is in the opposite direction of BD, then angle between BE and BD would be 180° - 43° = 137°. 

Then, if BA and BE are both rays from B, then the angle between BA and BE would depend on their positions. However, if we assume that angle EBA (between EB and BA) is angle 7, then that angle plus angle EBC (43°) might relate to the angle between BA and BC.

Wait, if angle EBC is 43°, and angle between BA and BD is 47°, then if we consider the angle between BA and BC, since BD and BC are in a straight line, the angle between BA and BC would be 47° + 43° = 90°? Because angle between BA and BD is 47°, and angle between BE and BC is 43°, but if BE is in between BA and BC?

Wait, maybe not. Let me draw a rough mental picture. Imagine point B with line CD through it. Let's say BD is going to the right, and BC is going to the left. Then, BA is a line making a 47° angle with BD (to the right). So BA is going upwards at 47° from BD. Then, angle between BA and BC (which is to the left) would be 180° - 47° = 133°, assuming BA is above BD. 

Now, angle EBC is 43°, which is the angle between BE and BC. Since BC is to the left, BE is making a 43° angle with BC. So, from BC (left), turning 43° towards BD (right), which would place BE somewhere between BC and BD. Therefore, the angle between BE and BD would be 43°, since it's measured from BC to BE, which is 43°, and from BE to BD is 180° - 43° - ... Wait, no. If BE is between BC and BD, then the angle between BE and BD would be the remaining part of the straight line.

Wait, if BC is to the left, BD is to the right, and BE is between them. Then, the angle between BE and BC is 43°, so the angle between BE and BD would be 180° - 43° = 137°, but that seems large. Alternatively, maybe the angle between BE and BD is 43°, but that depends on how it's oriented.

Alternatively, maybe angle EBC (at B between E and C) is 43°, which would be the angle between BE and BC. Since BC is to the left, then BE is deviating from BC towards the right by 43°, so BE is at 43° from BC towards BD. Thus, the angle between BE and BD would be 180° - 43° - angle between BC and BD, but since BC and BD are a straight line, that's 180°, so the angle between BE and BD is 43°?

No, wait, if BC is to the left, BD is to the right. If BE is at 43° from BC towards BD, then the angle between BE and BD would be 180° - 43° = 137°, because from BE to BD is the rest of the straight line minus the 43° from BC to BE.

But then, if BA makes a 47° angle with BD (to the right), then BA is at 47° above BD. If BE is at 137° from BD (but that seems conflicting). Wait, perhaps I need to use the fact that angles around point B sum up appropriately.

Alternatively, maybe the key is that angles around point B involving BA, BE, and BC/BD.

We know that angle DBA is 47°, which is the angle between BD and BA. Also, angle EBC is 43°, the angle between BE and BC. Since BC and BD are opposite directions (as B is on line CD), then the angle between BE and BD would be 180° - 43° = 137°, as before.

Now, if BA is making a 47° angle with BD, and BE is making a 137° angle with BD, then the angle between BA and BE would be |137° - 47°| = 90°. Wait, that's interesting. So, angle between BA and BE would be 90°, which would be angle EBA. But according to the constraints, angle EBA is equal to angle 7. So, angle 7 would be 90°? But looking at the answer choices, option D is 90. However, the problem states that angle 6 and 8 are complementary, which we already used to find angle 6 as 43°, and angle 8 as 47°, and angle 7 is asked. But according to this reasoning, angle 7 would be 90°, which is option D. But let me check again.

Wait, but earlier steps said that angle between BA and BE is 90°, so angle EBA is 90°, which would be angle 7. However, the answer choices include 90 as option D. But wait, let me verify once more.

Another way: since angle DBA is 47°, angle EBC is 43°, and since BC and BD are a straight line, then the total angle around point B on one side of line CD would be 180°. So, if we consider angles on one side of line CD (say, the side where BA and BE are located), then angle between BA and BD is 47°, and angle between BE and BC is 43°. Since BC is in the opposite direction of BD, the angle between BE and BD would be 43°, but wait, that may not hold.

Alternatively, using linear pairs: if BE and BA are on different sides of BD, then maybe the sum of certain angles equals 180°.

Wait, maybe I need to consider triangle or transversal lines. Alternatively, think about the angles formed at point B.

Let me try a different approach. Let's denote:

- Let’s assume that line CD passes through point B, so points C, B, D are colinear.

- At point B, there are multiple lines: BA, BE, BC, BD.

Given:

- Angle DBA = 47° (which is angle between BD and BA)

- Angle EBC = 43° (angle between BE and BC)

Because BC and BD are in a straight line, the angle between BE and BD would be angle EBC + angle between BC and BD? Wait, no. Since BC is opposite to BD, the angle between BE and BD would be 180° - angle EBC. Wait, if angle between BE and BC is 43°, then the angle between BE and BD (which is in the opposite direction of BC) would be 180° - 43° = 137°, as earlier.

Now, if BA makes a 47° angle with BD, and BE makes a 137° angle with BD, then the angle between BA and BE would be 137° - 47° = 90°, which is angle EBA. Hence, angle EBA is 90°, which is angle 7. Therefore, the measure of angle 7 is 90°, corresponding to option D.

But wait, the answer choices have D as 90. But let me check if there's a mistake here.

Alternatively, maybe the angle between BA and BE isn't simply the difference between their angles with BD. Let me think carefully.

Imagine BD is horizontal to the right. BA is at 47° above BD. BE is at some angle relative to BD. If angle between BE and BC is 43°, and BC is to the left (opposite of BD), then BE is 43° above BC (i.e., 43° above the leftward direction). Which would put BE at 43° above the left, meaning 180° - 43° = 137° from the positive x-axis (if BD is the positive x-axis). Meanwhile, BA is at 47° from BD (positive x-axis), so its angle is 47° above the x-axis. The angle between BA and BE would be the difference between 137° and 47°, which is 90°. Yes, that gives 90°, so angle EBA is 90°, hence angle 7 is 90°, which is option D.

However, the answer choices include option D as 90. But wait, the initial statement says that angle 6 and 8 are complementary. We were told angle 8 is 47°, so angle 6 is 43°, which matches our previous calculation. But angle 7 is coming out as 90°, which is option D. However, sometimes problems can have tricks. Let me check if there's another possibility.

Wait, but another thought: if angle EBA is 90°, then that would make sense. But let's see if there's another relationship. For example, maybe triangle EBA has some properties, or other angles. But given the constraints, I don't see other relations. 

Alternatively, maybe my assumption about the configuration is wrong. What if angle EBC is not on the same side as BA? For example, maybe BE is on the other side of BD? But then the angle calculations would change. Let me consider that scenario.

Suppose that instead of BE being on the same side as BA, it's on the opposite side. Then, angle between BE and BD would be 43°, but that would make the angle between BA and BE as 47° + 43° = 90°, still giving angle EBA as 90°. Either way, regardless of whether BE is on the same or opposite side, the angle between BA and BE ends up being 90°, leading to angle 7 being 90°. 

Thus, the measure of angle 7 is 90°, so the answer is D. But let me cross-check with the answer choices again. The options are A. 43, B. 47, C. 86, D. 90. So D is 90. 

But wait, the problem says that angle 6 and 8 are complementary, which we used to find angle 6 as 43°, and angle 8 as 47°, which fits. Then, angle 7 comes out as 90°, which is option D. However, I want to ensure that there's no other interpretation of the angle relationships.

Another possible error: maybe the angle EBC is not 43°, but angle EBA is 43°? Wait, the first constraint says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C, B, EA)), MeasureOf(Angle(6))). Assuming that Angle(C, B, EA) is angle EBC, then yes, that would be 43°. If instead, it was angle EBA, then that would be angle 6, but the second constraint says angle EBA equals angle 7. So, likely angle EBC is angle 6, which is 43°, angle EBA is angle 7, which we found as 90°, and angle DBA is angle 8, which is 47°. 

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer is D. But let me check once more. If angle 7 is 90°, then that's option D. However, sometimes problems may expect a different approach. Let me think if there's another way this could be interpreted.

Alternative approach: maybe the angles at point B are part of a triangle or something else. For example, if points A, B, E are connected, forming triangle ABE, but without knowing more about the diagram, it's hard to tell. But given the constraints, the only logical conclusion seems to be that angle 7 is 90°, so answer D. 

But wait, let me check if angle 7 could be 43°, which is angle 6. But why would that be? If there's some congruence or similarity. But unless there's more info, like triangles being congruent or similar, which isn't stated. 

Alternatively, could there be an error in assuming the angle between BA and BE is 90°? Let me re-express the angles numerically.

Let me assign coordinates to visualize. Let’s set point B at origin (0,0). Let’s take line BD as the positive x-axis, so point D is at (d, 0), and point C is at (-c, 0) for some c > 0. 

Now, angle DBA is 47°, meaning BA forms a 47° angle with BD (the x-axis). So, BA is a line from B(0,0) making 47° above the x-axis. Let's say point A is somewhere along that line.

Next, angle EBC is 43°, which is the angle between BE and BC. Since BC is along the negative x-axis (from B to C), angle EBC = 43° implies that BE is making a 43° angle with BC (negative x-axis). Therefore, BE is at 43° above the negative x-axis, which translates to 180° - 43° = 137° from the positive x-axis.

Now, the angle between BA (47° from positive x-axis) and BE (137° from positive x-axis) is 137° - 47° = 90°, which confirms that angle EBA is 90°, hence angle 7 is 90°, which is option D.

This coordinate-based verification supports the earlier conclusion. Therefore, the answer should be D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $\angle 7$, we begin by analyzing the given geometric constraints and applying basic principles of angle measurement and complementarity.

---

### **Step 1: Understand Complementary Angles**

We are told that:

$$
\angle 6 \text{ and } \angle 8 \text{ are complementary}
$$

That means:

$$
\angle 6 + \angle 8 = 90^\circ
$$

And we are explicitly given:

$$
\angle 8 = 47^\circ
$$

Using substitution:

$$
\angle 6 = 90^\circ - 47^\circ = 43^\circ
$$

---

### **Step 2: Interpret Geometric Constraints**

From the problem, we get the following angular equivalences:

- $\angle(\text{C}, B, \text{EA}) = \angle 6$  
- $\angle(\text{E}, B, \text{A}) = \angle 7$  
- $\angle(\text{D}, B, \text{A}) = \angle 8$

Additionally, it is specified that:

- $B$ lies on the line through points $C$ and $D$. So, $C$, $B$, and $D$ are collinear, meaning the points lie on a straight line.

We interpret this geometrically as follows:

- $\angle(\text{D}, B, \text{A}) = \angle 8 = 47^\circ$: this is the angle between $\overrightarrow{BD}$ and $\overrightarrow{BA}$
- $\angle(\text{E}, B, \text{A}) = \angle 7$: this is the angle between $\overrightarrow{BE}$ and $\overrightarrow{BA}$
- $\angle(\text{C}, B, \text{EA}) = \angle 6 = 43^\circ$: this is the angle between $\overrightarrow{BE}$ and $\overrightarrow{BC}$

Note that $\overrightarrow{BC}$ and $\overrightarrow{BD}$ are in opposite directions because $C$, $B$, and $D$ are collinear with $B$ between $C$ and $D$.

---

### **Step 3: Use Coordinate Geometry to Determine $\angle 7$**

Let’s place point $B$ at the origin $(0, 0)$, and align the line $\overline{CD}$ horizontally:

- Let $\overline{BD}$ be the positive x-axis, i.e., direction from $B$ to $D$
- Then $\overline{BC}$ is in the negative x-direction

Now define vectors based on these directions:

- Vector $\vec{BA}$ makes an angle of $47^\circ$ with $\overrightarrow{BD}$ (i.e., the x-axis)
- Vector $\vec{BE}$ makes an angle of $43^\circ$ with $\overrightarrow{BC}$, which corresponds to $180^\circ - 43^\circ = 137^\circ$ from the positive x-axis

Now compute the angle between $\vec{BA}$ and $\vec{BE}$:

$$
\angle(\vec{BA}, \vec{BE}) = 137^\circ - 47^\circ = 90^\circ
$$

This angle is precisely $\angle(\text{E}, B, \text{A})$, which is defined as $\angle 7$.

---

### **Conclusion**

The measure of $\angle 7$ is therefore:

$$
\boxed{90^\circ}
$$

---

### **Final Answer**

$$
\text{Final Answer: D}
$$
