MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out how to find the length of arc AB. The problem gives me some geometric constraints, so I need to parse through them carefully.

First, the given information:

- The length of line AD is 14 units. So points A, O, and D are colinear? Wait, no. Wait, there's another condition that says PointLiesOnLine(O, Line(A, D)). That means point O lies on the line segment AD. So O is somewhere along AD. Also, points A, B, and D lie on a circle centered at O. Because PointLiesOnCircle(A, Circle(O, radius_0_0)) implies that A is on the circle with center O and radius r (radius_0_0). Similarly for B and D. So OA = OB = OD = radius of the circle. Therefore, triangle AOB and triangle AOD are both triangles with two sides equal to the radius. But since O is on AD, then AO + OD = AD. Wait, but AD is 14. Since OA and OD are radii, their lengths would add up to AD. Let me write that down.

Let me denote the radius as r. Then OA = r, OD = r. Therefore, OA + OD = AD. But AD is 14. So OA + OD = r + r = 2r = 14 → r = 7. So the radius of the circle is 7 units. Therefore, OA = OB = OD = 7. 

Wait, but hold on. If O is on AD, then AD is split into two parts: AO and OD. So AO + OD = AD = 14. But since OA and OD are both radii, they should each be equal to the radius. Therefore, OA = OD = 7, which makes sense because 7 + 7 = 14. So O is the midpoint of AD?

But wait, maybe not necessarily the midpoint? Wait, if O is on AD, then AD is divided into AO and OD. However, since A, B, D are all on the same circle centered at O, then OA = OB = OD. So yes, OA = OD. Therefore, O must be the midpoint of AD. Therefore, AO = OD = 7. So O is the midpoint of AD. Got it.

Now, the angle at O between points A and B is 80 degrees. So angle AOB is 80 degrees. Since OA and OB are both radii of the circle, triangle AOB is an isosceles triangle with OA = OB = 7, and vertex angle at O being 80 degrees. The question asks for the length of arc AB. 

Arc length can be calculated using the formula: arc length = θ * r, where θ is the central angle in radians. So first, we need to convert the angle from degrees to radians. 

Given that angle AOB is 80 degrees. Let me compute θ in radians. 80 degrees times π/180 equals... Well, π/180 * 80 = (4π)/9 ≈ 1.396 radians. Then multiply by radius r = 7. So arc length AB would be 7 * (4π)/9. Let me calculate that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can check my steps again. Let me confirm:

Since the circle has radius 7, and the central angle is 80 degrees. Arc length s = rθ, where θ is in radians. So converting 80 degrees to radians: 80° × π/180 = 4π/9 radians. Multiply by radius 7: s = 7*(4π/9) = 28π/9 ≈ ?

Calculating 28π / 9. Let me approximate π as 3.1416. So 28*3.1416 = approx 28*3.14 = 87.92. Divided by 9: 87.92 / 9 ≈ 9.768... So approximately 9.77 when rounded to the nearest hundredth. Which matches option B.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps. Are there any other factors here?

Wait, the problem mentions points A, B, D lying on the circle. So angle AOB is indeed the central angle. Therefore, arc AB corresponds to that angle. So yes, the calculation seems right. So the arc length is about 9.77, which is option B.

But just to double-check, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that O is the midpoint? Let me re-examine that part.

The problem states that O lies on line AD. And points A, B, D lie on the circle centered at O. Therefore, OA = OB = OD. Hence, OA = OD, meaning O is equidistant from A and D, hence lies on the perpendicular bisector of AD. But since O is on line AD, the only way for O to be equidistant from A and D is if O is the midpoint of AD. Therefore, AO = OD = 7. Therefore, AD is 14. So that part checks out.

Therefore, the arc length AB is indeed 28π/9 ≈ 9.77. So answer B.

Wait, but let me check the exact value. Let me calculate 28π/9 more accurately. π is approximately 3.1415926536.

So 28 * π = 28 * 3.1415926536 ≈ 28 * 3.1415926536.

Compute 28 * 3 = 84, 28 * 0.1415926536 ≈ 28 * 0.1415926536 ≈ Let me compute 28 * 0.1415926536:

Well, 0.1415926536 * 28:

Breakdown:

0.1 * 28 = 2.8

0.04 * 28 = 1.12

0.0015926536 * 28 ≈ 0.0445943...

Adding those together: 2.8 + 1.12 = 3.92 + 0.0445943 ≈ 3.9645943.

Total 28π ≈ 84 + 3.9645943 ≈ 87.9645943.

Divide by 9: 87.9645943 / 9 ≈ 9.7738438...

Which rounds to 9.77 when rounded to the nearest hundredth. Therefore, answer B is correct.

I think that's solid. All steps check out. No mistakes detected. So the correct answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the length of arc $ \widehat{AB} $, we begin by analyzing the given geometric constraints and applying relevant theorems.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**
We are told:
- The line segment $ AD $ has length 14.
- Points $ A $, $ B $, and $ D $ lie on a circle centered at point $ O $.
- Point $ O $ lies on the line segment $ AD $.
- The measure of angle $ \angle AOB $ is 80 degrees.

From these facts:
- Since $ A $, $ B $, and $ D $ lie on a circle with center $ O $, the distances $ OA $, $ OB $, and $ OD $ are all equal — i.e., they are radii of the circle.
- Given that $ O $ lies on $ AD $, and $ OA = OD $, point $ O $ must be the **midpoint** of $ AD $. Thus,
$$
OA = OD = \frac{AD}{2} = \frac{14}{2} = 7
$$
Hence, the **radius** of the circle is 7 units.

---

### **Step 2: Use the Central Angle to Find the Arc Length**

We are asked to find the **length of arc** $ \widehat{AB} $, which subtends a central angle $ \theta = \angle AOB = 80^\circ $.

The formula for the arc length $ s $ of a circle is:
$$
s = r\theta
$$
where:
- $ r $ is the radius of the circle
- $ \theta $ is the central angle in **radians**

Convert the angle from degrees to radians:
$$
\theta = 80^\circ \times \left(\frac{\pi}{180}\right) = \frac{4\pi}{9}
$$

Substitute values into the arc length formula:
$$
s = 7 \times \frac{4\pi}{9} = \frac{28\pi}{9}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Compute the Numerical Value**

Use $ \pi \approx 3.1415926536 $:
$$
s = \frac{28 \times 3.1415926536}{9} \approx \frac{87.9645943}{9} \approx 9.7738...
$$

Rounded to the nearest hundredth:
$$
s \approx 9.77
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

The length of arc $ \widehat{AB} $ is approximately **9.77**, matching **option B**.

$$
\boxed{\text{Final Answer: B}}
$$
