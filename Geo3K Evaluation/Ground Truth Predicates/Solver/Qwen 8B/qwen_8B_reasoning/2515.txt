MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. The problem says that triangle RST is congruent to triangle ABC. So, their corresponding parts should be equal. Let me recall the congruence criteria for triangles. Since they're congruent, all corresponding sides and angles should be equal. 

First, looking at the given information:

The length of line segment ST is 2y - 8, and the length of line segment CB is y + 13. Since the triangles are congruent, the corresponding sides should be equal. But I need to figure out which sides correspond. In triangle RST and ABC, the order of the letters matters. For congruence, the order tells us which vertices correspond. So, vertex R corresponds to A, S to B, and T to C. Therefore, side RT corresponds to AC, RS corresponds to AB, and ST corresponds to BC. Wait, no. Wait, the sides opposite the angles... Hmm, maybe I should think about the correspondence based on the order of the vertices.

So, triangle RST ≅ triangle ABC. That means angle R corresponds to angle A, angle S to angle B, and angle T to angle C. Therefore, side RS corresponds to AB, side ST corresponds to BC, and side RT corresponds to AC. So, the side ST in triangle RST corresponds to side BC in triangle ABC. Therefore, their lengths should be equal. So, Length(ST) = Length(BC). Given that Length(ST) is 2y - 8 and Length(BC) is y + 13. Therefore, setting them equal:

2y - 8 = y + 13

Solving for y: subtract y from both sides gives y - 8 = 13, then add 8 to both sides: y = 21. Okay, so y is 21. But wait, the question asks for x. So maybe we need another equation involving x?

Looking at the angles. The measure of angle RST (which is angle at S in triangle RST) is 5x + 20 degrees. And the measure of angle CBA (angle at B in triangle ABC) is 3x + 40 degrees. Since the triangles are congruent, the corresponding angles should be equal. So angle RST in triangle RST corresponds to angle CBA in triangle ABC? Wait, let me check again.

Angle RST is angle at S, which corresponds to angle at B in triangle ABC because the correspondence is R→A, S→B, T→C. So angle at S (RST) corresponds to angle at B (ABC). Wait, angle CBA is angle at B. So yes, angle RST equals angle CBA. Therefore, their measures are equal. So set 5x + 20 = 3x + 40.

Solving that: subtract 3x from both sides: 2x + 20 = 40. Then subtract 20: 2x = 20. Divide by 2: x = 10. So x is 10. 

Wait, but let me make sure there isn't something else. Are there other angles or sides that might affect this? Let me double-check. The problem only gives two equations: one for the sides (ST and BC) leading to y=21, and one for the angles (RST and CBA) leading to x=10. Since the triangles are congruent, all corresponding angles and sides must be equal. So those two equations should suffice. 

But just to confirm, maybe there's more than one pair of angles? For example, maybe another angle? However, the problem only provides info about angle RST and angle CBA. So unless there's another angle given, perhaps we don't need it. 

Alternatively, could there be a case where the correspondence is different? Like maybe the triangles are congruent but with a different correspondence? But the notation △RST ≅ △ABC implies the order of the vertices, so the correspondence is fixed as R→A, S→B, T→C. So the angles and sides must correspond accordingly. 

Therefore, solving 5x + 20 = 3x + 40 gives x = 10. Which is option B. 

Let me check the answer choices again. The options are A. 8, B.10, C.13, D.21. So x=10 would be option B. 

But just to ensure, let's verify with the value of y. If y=21, then Length(ST)=2*21 -8 = 42-8=34. Length(BC)=21 +13=34. So that checks out. 

For angles, plugging x=10 into 5x +20: 5*10 +20=50+20=70 degrees. And 3x +40: 3*10 +40=30+40=70 degrees. So that also checks out. 

Hence, x=10 is correct. The answer should be B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we begin by analyzing the given geometric constraints and leveraging the fact that the triangles $ \triangle RST $ and $ \triangle ABC $ are **congruent**. This implies that **corresponding sides and angles are equal**, due to the definition of triangle congruence via vertex order.

### Step 1: Understand the Correspondence

Given:
$$
\triangle RST \cong \triangle ABC
$$
This implies the correspondence:
- Vertex $ R \leftrightarrow A $
- Vertex $ S \leftrightarrow B $
- Vertex $ T \leftrightarrow C $

Thus:
- Side $ RS \leftrightarrow AB $
- Side $ ST \leftrightarrow BC $
- Side $ RT \leftrightarrow AC $

Similarly for angles:
- Angle $ \angle RST \leftrightarrow \angle CBA $

---

### Step 2: Use Given Side Lengths

We are told:
$$
\text{Length}(ST) = 2y - 8,\quad \text{Length}(BC) = y + 13
$$
Since these are corresponding sides of congruent triangles, they must be equal:
$$
2y - 8 = y + 13
$$
Solving:
$$
2y - y = 13 + 8 \\
y = 21
$$

---

### Step 3: Use Given Angle Measures

We are told:
$$
m(\angle RST) = 5x + 20,\quad m(\angle CBA) = 3x + 40
$$
Again, since these are corresponding angles in congruent triangles, they must be equal:
$$
5x + 20 = 3x + 40
$$
Solving:
$$
5x - 3x = 40 - 20 \\
2x = 20 \\
x = 10
$$

---

### Final Verification

Plug $ x = 10 $ back into both expressions for the angle measures:
- $ 5(10) + 20 = 70^\circ $
- $ 3(10) + 40 = 70^\circ $

Both match, confirming our solution.

\boxed{\text{B}}
