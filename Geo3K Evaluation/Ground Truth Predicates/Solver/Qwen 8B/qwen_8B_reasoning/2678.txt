MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given constraints and figure out how they relate to each other. The question is asking for the measure of angle 2, which is given as 2x, and angle 3 is x. So ultimately, we need to find the value of 2x based on the geometric relationships provided.

Let me start by listing out all the given information:

1. Angle at HGB (Angle H, G, B) equals angle 2.
2. Angle at FHB (Angle F, H, G) equals angle 1.
3. Angle at JHB (Angle B, J, H) equals angle 3.
4. Point B lies on lines JG and HF.
5. Points J, G, H, F lie on a circle centered at A with radius 4.0.
6. Lines GB and HB are perpendicular.
7. Lines HG and JH are perpendicular.

Wait, let me make sure I got that right. The Perpendicular conditions: Line GB is perpendicular to Line HB, and Line HG is perpendicular to Line JH. Hmm. Also, points J, G, H, F are on the same circle centered at A. That suggests that these four points are concyclic, lying on a circle with center A.

So first, since all those points are on a circle centered at A, then AJ = AG = AH = AF = 4.0 units. Therefore, triangle AGH, AFG, AJH, etc., are all radii of the circle. Wait, but point B is also involved here. Let me note down all the points mentioned: A, B, F, G, H, J.

Points J, G, H, F are on the circle centered at A. Point B lies on lines JG and HF. Also, line GB is perpendicular to line HB, so angles at B between GB and HB are 90 degrees? Wait, no. If two lines are perpendicular, then their slopes are negative reciprocals, but maybe more importantly, the angle between them is 90 degrees. But the problem mentions Perpendicular(Line(G,B), Line(H,B)). So the lines GB and HB are perpendicular. So at point B, the lines GB and HB meet at a right angle. Therefore, triangle GBH is a right-angled triangle at B.

Also, there's another perpendicular condition: Perpendicular(Line(H,G), Line(J,H)). So line HG is perpendicular to line JH. Therefore, at point H, the lines HG and JH form a right angle. So angle JHG is 90 degrees.

Now, considering that points J, G, H, F are on a circle centered at A. Let me try to visualize this. Maybe drawing a diagram would help, but since I can't draw, I'll have to imagine it.

First, since J, G, H, F are on the circle with center A, then quadrilateral JGFH is cyclic. Moreover, since lines JG and HF intersect at point B, which lies on both lines. So point B is the intersection of JG and HF. Also, since GB is perpendicular to HB, and HG is perpendicular to JH.

Let me consider triangles and angles. Since HG is perpendicular to JH, angle JHG is 90 degrees. So triangle JHG is right-angled at H. Similarly, triangle GBH is right-angled at B.

Given that, perhaps we can use some cyclic quadrilateral properties, right angles, and maybe similar triangles?

Also, angles mentioned: angle at HGB (which is angle 2) equals angle 2, angle at FHB (angle 1), and angle at JHB (angle 3). Let me clarify which angles these are.

Angle 2 is angle HGB, meaning vertex at G, with segments HG and GB. Wait, no. In standard notation, angle HGB would be the angle at point G between points H, G, B. So the angle at G formed by points H, G, B. Similarly, angle FHB is the angle at H between points F, H, B. And angle JHB is the angle at H between points J, H, B.

But wait, angle JHB would be at point H between J and B. However, since J is on the circle, and H is also on the circle. Also, since line JH is part of the circle. Given that HG is perpendicular to JH, so line JH is perpendicular to line HG. Therefore, angle between JH and HG is 90 degrees.

Since J, G, H, F are on the circle, maybe there are inscribed angles here. For example, angles subtended by the same chord might be equal.

Alternatively, since multiple right angles are present, maybe using Thales' theorem, which states that if you have a triangle inscribed in a semicircle, it's a right triangle. But since the circle is centered at A, unless the diameter is involved, but we don't know yet.

Let me think about coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates could help. Let me place point A at the origin (0,0) since it's the center of the circle. Then, points J, G, H, F are all at distance 4 from A. Let me assign coordinates to these points. However, without knowing specific positions, this might get complex, but maybe manageable.

Let me assume coordinates. Let me suppose that point H is located at (4, 0), since it's on the circle centered at A(0,0). Then, since line HG is perpendicular to JH, and JH is a line from H to J. Let me think about direction of JH. Since HG is perpendicular to JH, and H is at (4,0). Suppose line JH has some slope, and line HG is perpendicular to it.

But maybe choosing coordinate system smartly. Let me try to set up coordinates such that some points align nicely.

Let me take point H at (4, 0). Since HG is perpendicular to JH. Let me suppose that line JH is vertical, so that line HG is horizontal. Wait, if JH is vertical, then HG is horizontal. Let me see.

If line JH is vertical, then point J would be directly above or below H. Since H is at (4,0), if line JH is vertical, then J is somewhere along the y-axis through H. Wait, but H is at (4,0); a vertical line through H would be x=4. So J would be at (4, y) for some y. However, since J is on the circle centered at A(0,0) with radius 4, its coordinates must satisfy x² + y² = 16. If J is at (4, y), then substituting into equation: 4² + y² = 16 → 16 + y² = 16 ⇒ y=0. But that would put J at (4,0), which is the same as H. Not possible. Therefore, my assumption that JH is vertical leads to conflict. Hence, maybe line JH isn't vertical. Alternatively, maybe I should pick different coordinates.

Alternative approach: Let me take point H at (4,0), as before. Since line HG is perpendicular to line JH. Let me denote line JH as having slope m, then line HG has slope -1/m.

But without loss of generality, maybe assign coordinates to simplify. Let me assume that line JH is horizontal. Then line HG would be vertical. If JH is horizontal, then line JH is horizontal, so J and H are aligned horizontally. Since H is at (4,0), then J would be somewhere along the horizontal line passing through H. Let me say J is at (a, 0). But since J is on the circle centered at A(0,0), so (a)^2 + 0^2 = 16 ⇒ a = ±4. But H is already at (4,0), so J cannot be at (4,0). So J would be at (-4, 0)? But then line JH connects (-4,0) to (4,0), which is the diameter of the circle. Then line JH is horizontal, and line HG is vertical. So line HG is vertical. Since H is at (4,0), vertical line through H is x=4. So point G is somewhere along x=4, but also on the circle. Plugging x=4 into circle equation: 4² + y² = 16 ⇒ y² = 0 ⇒ y=0. Thus, point G would be (4,0), but that's same as H. Contradiction again. So line JH can't be horizontal either. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong.

Hmm, perhaps I need to take a different approach. Let me instead consider that since HG ⊥ JH, then triangle JHG is right-angled at H. Therefore, JH and HG are legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse JG. But since J, G, H are on the circle centered at A, so JG is a chord of the circle. The length of JG can be determined via coordinates or other means.

Alternatively, since J, G, H, F are all on the circle, quadrilateral JGFH is cyclic. Also, point B is the intersection of JG and HF. Additionally, GB ⊥ HB, so triangle GBH is right-angled at B. 

Maybe applying power of a point. Since point B lies on chords JG and HF, then power of point B with respect to circle A gives:

BJ * BG = BH * BF

Because for point B outside or inside the circle. Wait, but since B lies on the chords, depending on whether B is inside or outside the circle. Let me check if B is inside or outside the circle. Since points J, G, H, F are on the circle, and B is the intersection of JG and HF. If JG and HF are secants, then B could be inside or outside. However, given that GB is perpendicular to HB, maybe B is inside the circle.

Assuming B is inside the circle, then power of point B would give BJ * BG = BH * BF. This might be useful later.

But maybe focusing on angles. Let me recall that angle at HGB (angle 2) is equal to angle 2. Also, angle at JHB (angle 3) is equal to angle 3. Also, angle at FHB is angle 1.

Additionally, since HG ⊥ JH, angle JHG is 90 degrees. So in triangle JHG, angle at H is 90°, making it a right triangle. So JH and HG are perpendicular.

Moreover, since J, G, H are on the circle, maybe there's something about the angles subtended by arcs. For instance, angle JHG is an inscribed angle, but since it's 90°, that implies that the arc JG is 180°, because inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc. Wait, angle JHG is an inscribed angle subtended by arc JG. Wait, but angle at H, so yes. If angle JHG is 90°, then arc JG measures 180°, so JG is a diameter of the circle. Therefore, JG is a diameter. Therefore, the midpoint of JG is the center A? Wait, since the circle's center is A. If JG is a diameter, then the midpoint of JG is A. Therefore, A is the midpoint of JG. So AJ = AG = 4, so JG is 8 units long, since radius is 4. So that makes sense.

Therefore, JG is a diameter. Therefore, points J and G are endpoints of a diameter. So A is the midpoint of JG. Therefore, coordinates of A are the midpoint between J and G. So if I place J and G symmetrically around A, then that's helpful.

Similarly, since F is also on the circle, and HF is a line passing through point B. Also, line HF intersects JG at B, which is inside the circle.

Now, since JG is a diameter, then any angle subtended by JG on the circumference is a right angle. For example, angle JBG would be a right angle if B were on the circle, but since B is inside, not sure.

But let's proceed. Since JG is a diameter, then angle JHG is 90°, as established earlier. Now, considering triangle JHG, right-angled at H. Also, since A is the midpoint of JG, then HA is the median from H to JG. Wait, but H is a point on the circle. Wait, H is one endpoint of the diameter JG? No, JG is a diameter, so H is another point on the circle. Wait, no. Wait, J and G are endpoints of the diameter, so H is another point on the circle. So H is not necessarily on the diameter JG. Wait, but earlier we had that HG is perpendicular to JH. So line HG is perpendicular to line JH. Given that JG is a diameter.

Let me try to assign coordinates again, taking advantage of JG being a diameter. Let me set coordinate system with A at (0,0), J at (-4,0), G at (4,0), making JG the diameter along the x-axis. Then, point H is another point on the circle. Let me parametrize point H as (4 cos θ, 4 sin θ), since it's on the circle of radius 4.

Now, line JH connects J(-4,0) to H(4 cos θ, 4 sin θ). The slope of JH would be [4 sin θ - 0]/[4 cos θ - (-4)] = [4 sin θ]/[4(cos θ + 1)] = [sin θ]/[cos θ + 1].

Then, line HG is supposed to be perpendicular to JH. The slope of line HG is the negative reciprocal of the slope of JH. Let me compute slope of HG. Point G is (4,0), and point H is (4 cos θ, 4 sin θ). So the slope of HG is [4 sin θ - 0]/[4 cos θ - 4] = [4 sin θ]/[4 (cos θ - 1)] = [sin θ]/(cos θ - 1).

The product of the slopes of JH and HG should be -1 because they are perpendicular. Let me check:

Slope_JH * Slope_HG = [sin θ / (cos θ + 1)] * [sin θ / (cos θ - 1)] = [sin²θ] / [(cos θ + 1)(cos θ - 1)] = [sin²θ] / [cos²θ - 1] = [sin²θ] / (-sin²θ) = -1. Which satisfies the perpendicularity condition! So regardless of θ, this holds true. Therefore, our setup is consistent. Therefore, point H can be anywhere on the circle except J and G, and the condition that HG ⊥ JH is automatically satisfied when JG is a diameter. Interesting!

So this tells us that JG is indeed a diameter, and H is any point on the circle. Now, moving forward with this coordinate system.

Now, point B lies on both JG and HF. Wait, no. Earlier constraint says PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(J, G)) and PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(H, F)). So point B is the intersection of lines JG and HF. So line HF passes through B, and line JG passes through B. Therefore, B is the intersection point of JG and HF.

We also have that line GB is perpendicular to line HB. So, in coordinates, let me find coordinates of B.

First, let me parameterize line HF. We need to define point F. Since F is on the circle, let me parametrize it similarly. Let me assume point F is another arbitrary point on the circle. However, since we have line HF passing through B, which is also on JG. So let me find equations for lines HF and JG, find their intersection B, then impose the condition that GB ⊥ HB.

But this seems complicated with too many variables. Maybe we can find relations using the fact that GB ⊥ HB.

Alternatively, since we have coordinates for J, G, H, we can express B as the intersection of JG and HF. Let me attempt that.

First, line JG is the diameter from J(-4,0) to G(4,0), which is the x-axis itself. So equation of line JG is y = 0.

Point B lies on line JG, so its coordinates are (b, 0) for some b between -4 and 4 (assuming B is inside the circle). Now, line HF passes through B and point F. But we need to determine F such that line HF passes through B. Also, point F is on the circle.

But without knowing F's position, it's difficult. However, we also have the condition that GB is perpendicular to HB. Let's write that.

Coordinates:

Point G is (4, 0)

Point B is (b, 0)

Point H is (4 cos θ, 4 sin θ)

Vector GB is from G to B: (b - 4, 0 - 0) = (b - 4, 0)

Vector HB is from H to B: (b - 4 cos θ, 0 - 4 sin θ) = (b - 4 cos θ, -4 sin θ)

For GB and HB to be perpendicular, their dot product must be zero.

Dot product: (b - 4)(b - 4 cos θ) + (0)(-4 sin θ) = 0

Which simplifies to:

(b - 4)(b - 4 cos θ) = 0

Thus, either b = 4 or b = 4 cos θ.

But point B is on line JG (the x-axis) and also on line HF. If b = 4, then point B coincides with G, but then line HF would pass through G. However, if B is G, then line HB would be line HG, and GB would be zero vector, which doesn't make sense for perpendicularity. Therefore, likely b ≠ 4, so we have b = 4 cos θ.

Therefore, the x-coordinate of B is 4 cos θ, and since B is on JG (y=0), coordinates of B are (4 cos θ, 0).

Now, point B is (4 cos θ, 0). Now, line HF passes through B and F. Since F is on the circle, let me find coordinates of F such that line HF passes through B.

Let me parametrize line HF. It goes through H(4 cos θ, 4 sin θ) and B(4 cos θ, 0). Wait, hold on! Wait, if B is (4 cos θ, 0), then line HF connects H(4 cos θ, 4 sin θ) to B(4 cos θ, 0). Therefore, line HF is a vertical line at x = 4 cos θ. Because both points H and B have x-coordinate 4 cos θ. Therefore, line HF is vertical line x = 4 cos θ.

But point F is on this line and on the circle. So let's find coordinates of F. Since F lies on x = 4 cos θ and on the circle x² + y² = 16.

Substituting x = 4 cos θ into circle equation:

(4 cos θ)^2 + y^2 = 16

=> 16 cos²θ + y² = 16

=> y² = 16(1 - cos²θ) = 16 sin²θ

Therefore, y = ±4 sin θ. So points on line HF (x = 4 cos θ) are (4 cos θ, 4 sin θ) and (4 cos θ, -4 sin θ). But point H is already at (4 cos θ, 4 sin θ), so the other intersection point is (4 cos θ, -4 sin θ). Therefore, point F must be (4 cos θ, -4 sin θ).

Therefore, coordinates of F are (4 cos θ, -4 sin θ).

Now, we have coordinates for all points:

- J(-4, 0)
- G(4, 0)
- H(4 cos θ, 4 sin θ)
- F(4 cos θ, -4 sin θ)
- B(4 cos θ, 0)

Now, let's verify that line HF passes through B. Yes, since line HF is x = 4 cos θ, and B is on that line.

Now, we need to find angles related to angle 2, angle 1, and angle 3.

First, let's identify angle 2, which is angle HGB. That is, at point G, between points H, G, B.

So angle at G between H and B. Let's calculate that.

Point G is at (4, 0). Points H(4 cos θ, 4 sin θ), G(4, 0), B(4 cos θ, 0).

So vectors GH and GB.

Vector GH is from G to H: (4 cos θ - 4, 4 sin θ - 0) = (4 (cos θ - 1), 4 sin θ)

Vector GB is from G to B: (4 cos θ - 4, 0 - 0) = (4 (cos θ - 1), 0)

So angle between vectors GH and GB at point G is angle 2.

To find this angle, we can use the dot product formula:

cos(angle) = (GH · GB) / (|GH| |GB|)

Compute GH · GB:

[4 (cos θ - 1)] * [4 (cos θ - 1)] + [4 sin θ] * 0 = 16 (cos θ - 1)^2

|GH| = sqrt[(4 (cos θ - 1))^2 + (4 sin θ)^2] = 4 sqrt{(cos θ - 1)^2 + sin²θ} = 4 sqrt{cos²θ - 2 cos θ + 1 + sin²θ} = 4 sqrt{(cos²θ + sin²θ) - 2 cos θ + 1} = 4 sqrt{1 - 2 cos θ + 1} = 4 sqrt{2 - 2 cos θ} = 4√(2(1 - cos θ)) = 4 * √(2) * √(1 - cos θ)

|GB| = sqrt[(4 (cos θ - 1))^2 + 0] = 4 |cos θ - 1|

Note that cos θ - 1 is negative or zero, so |GB| = 4 (1 - cos θ)

Putting it together:

cos(angle 2) = [16 (cos θ - 1)^2] / [4√(2) * √(1 - cos θ) * 4 (1 - cos θ)] ]

Simplify denominator: 4 * 4 * √(2) * √(1 - cos θ) * (1 - cos θ) ) ?

Wait, let me recheck:

Denominator is |GH| * |GB| = [4√(2) * √(1 - cos θ)] * [4 (1 - cos θ)] = 16 √2 * √(1 - cos θ) * (1 - cos θ) )

Numerator is 16 (cos θ - 1)^2 = 16 (1 - cos θ)^2

Therefore,

cos(angle 2) = [16 (1 - cos θ)^2 ] / [16 √2 * √(1 - cos θ) * (1 - cos θ) ) ] = [ (1 - cos θ)^2 ] / [ √2 * (1 - cos θ) * (1 - cos θ) ) ] = 1/√2

Therefore, cos(angle 2) = 1/√2 ⇒ angle 2 is 45°, since cos(45°) = √2/2 ≈ 0.707, which is 1/√2.

Wait, but 1/√2 is approximately 0.707, which corresponds to 45 degrees. So angle 2 is 45°, which would mean that 2x = 45°, so x = 22.5°, but then angle 3 is x = 22.5°, which may not match any of the options. However, the answer choices are A. 30, B. 45, C. 60, D. 90. So angle 2 is 45°, which is option B. But let me confirm if this is accurate.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me double-check:

After simplifying numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 16(1 - cos θ)^2

Denominator: 16√2 * √(1 - cos θ) * (1 - cos θ)

Wait, actually, the denominator was:

Original denominator after expansion:

[4√(2) * √(1 - cos θ)] multiplied by [4(1 - cos θ)]

So total denominator: 4*4 * √2 * √(1 - cos θ)*(1 - cos θ) = 16√2*(1 - cos θ)^{1 + 0.5} ? Wait, no:

Wait, √(1 - cos θ) times (1 - cos θ) is (1 - cos θ)^{1.5}, but maybe better to factor:

Let me write denominator as 16√2 * (1 - cos θ)^{3/2}

Numerator is 16(1 - cos θ)^2

So overall:

[16(1 - cos θ)^2] / [16√2 (1 - cos θ)^{3/2}] ] = [ (1 - cos θ)^{2 - 3/2} ] / √2 = (1 - cos θ)^{1/2}/√2 = √(1 - cos θ)/√2

Wait, but previously I thought it simplified to 1/√2, but that was incorrect. There was a mistake in the previous step.

Wait, let me redo:

Original expression:

cos(angle 2) = [16(1 - cos θ)^2] / [16√2 * √(1 - cos θ) * (1 - cos θ) ) ] 

Cancel 16 in numerator and denominator:

[ (1 - cos θ)^2 ] / [ √2 * √(1 - cos θ) * (1 - cos θ) ) ] 

Simplify denominator terms:

√(1 - cos θ) * (1 - cos θ) = (1 - cos θ)^{1 + 0.5} = (1 - cos θ)^{1.5}

So numerator is (1 - cos θ)^2, denominator is √2 * (1 - cos θ)^{1.5}

Thus:

cos(angle 2) = [ (1 - cos θ)^2 ] / [ √2 (1 - cos θ)^{1.5} } ] = [ (1 - cos θ)^{2 - 1.5} ] / √2 = [ (1 - cos θ)^{0.5} ] / √2 = √(1 - cos θ) / √2

So cos(angle 2) = √(1 - cos θ) / √2

This depends on θ, which complicates things. So my previous conclusion that angle 2 is 45° was incorrect. I must have messed up the algebra earlier. So I need to find another way to find angle 2.

Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between angles due to cyclic quadrilaterals or other properties.

Let me think differently. Since angle 2 is angle HGB. From coordinates, we can calculate this angle.

Earlier, we had vectors GH and GB.

Vector GH: from G to H: (4 cos θ - 4, 4 sin θ)

Vector GB: from G to B: (4 cos θ - 4, 0)

So angle between these vectors is angle 2.

Alternatively, maybe compute tan(angle 2). Since vector GB is horizontal (from G to B is along x-axis from (4,0) to (4 cos θ, 0), which is leftward if cos θ < 1, so direction is towards decreasing x.

Vector GH has components (Δx, Δy) = (4 cos θ - 4, 4 sin θ). So the angle between GH and GB (which is along the negative x-axis from G to B) can be calculated using tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent.

Wait, the angle between GH and GB. Since GB is along negative x-axis from G, and GH goes from G to H.

So if we consider the triangle formed by G, H, and projection of H onto GB axis.

Alternatively, since we have coordinates, maybe compute the angle using arctangent of the slope.

The slope of GH is Δy / Δx = [4 sin θ] / [4 cos θ - 4] = [sin θ] / [cos θ - 1]

Which is equal to - [sin θ] / [1 - cos θ]. Let me rationalize this:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + cos θ):

- [sin θ (1 + cos θ)] / [ (1 - cos θ)(1 + cos θ) ] = - [sin θ (1 + cos θ)] / (1 - cos²θ) = - [sin θ (1 + cos θ)] / sin²θ = - [ (1 + cos θ) / sin θ ] 

So slope of GH is - (1 + cos θ)/sin θ

Therefore, the angle between GH and GB (which is along negative x-axis) is the angle whose tangent is slope of GH. Wait, since GB is along negative x-axis, the angle between GH and GB would be the angle whose tangent is slope of GH, but adjusted for direction.

Wait, if I consider the line GH making an angle φ with the negative x-axis (since GB is along negative x-axis), then tan φ = slope of GH.

So tan φ = - (1 + cos θ)/sin θ.

But tan φ = slope, which is negative. So φ is measured from negative x-axis upwards (or downwards) depending on sign.

Alternatively, since we're dealing with magnitudes, perhaps take absolute values.

But this seems getting too abstract. Let me plug in specific values for θ to see if I can find a relation.

Suppose θ = 60°, so cos θ = 0.5, sin θ = (√3)/2.

Then, tan φ = - (1 + 0.5)/(√3/2) = -(1.5) / (√3/2) = - (3/2) / (√3/2) = -3/√3 = -√3. So φ = arctan(-√3). Since φ is the angle between GH and negative x-axis, and tan φ = -√3, which implies φ is 60° below the negative x-axis, i.e., pointing downward. So angle between GH and negative x-axis is 60°, hence angle between GH and GB (which is along negative x-axis) is 60°, so angle 2 would be 60°, which is option C. But this is just for θ=60°, but we need to find general case.

However, since angle 2 is dependent on θ, but the problem states that angle 3 is x and angle 2 is 2x. Perhaps there is a relationship between angle 2 and angle 3 derived from other constraints.

Let me look at angle 3, which is angle JHB. Angle at H between J and B.

Point J is (-4, 0), H is (4 cos θ, 4 sin θ), B is (4 cos θ, 0).

So angle at H between points J, H, B.

Vectors HJ and HB.

Vector HJ is from H to J: (-4 - 4 cos θ, 0 - 4 sin θ) = (-4(1 + cos θ), -4 sin θ)

Vector HB is from H to B: (4 cos θ - 4 cos θ, 0 - 4 sin θ) = (0, -4 sin θ)

So angle between vectors HJ and HB is angle 3.

Let me compute this angle. Using dot product:

cos(angle 3) = (HJ · HB) / (|HJ| |HB|)

Compute HJ · HB:

[-4(1 + cos θ)] * 0 + [-4 sin θ] * (-4 sin θ) = 0 + 16 sin²θ = 16 sin²θ

|HJ| = sqrt[ (-4(1 + cos θ))² + (-4 sin θ)^2 ] = 4 sqrt[ (1 + cos θ)^2 + sin²θ ]

Expand (1 + cos θ)^2 + sin²θ = 1 + 2 cos θ + cos²θ + sin²θ = 1 + 2 cos θ + 1 = 2 + 2 cos θ = 2(1 + cos θ)

Thus, |HJ| = 4 sqrt[2(1 + cos θ)] = 4√2 * sqrt(1 + cos θ)

|HB| = sqrt[0^2 + (-4 sin θ)^2] = 4 |sin θ|

So cos(angle 3) = [16 sin²θ] / [4√2 * sqrt(1 + cos θ) * 4 |sin θ| ] 

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 16 sin²θ

Denominator: 16√2 * sqrt(1 + cos θ) * |sin θ|

Assuming θ is between 0 and π (since H is on upper half of circle for simplicity), sin θ is positive, so |sin θ| = sin θ.

Thus:

cos(angle 3) = [16 sin²θ] / [16√2 * sqrt(1 + cos θ) * sin θ ] = [ sin θ ] / [ √2 * sqrt(1 + cos θ) ]

Again, simplify:

Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(1 - cos θ) to rationalize denominator?

Alternatively, use identity: 1 + cos θ = 2 cos²(θ/2), and sin θ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

Let me substitute:

sqrt(1 + cos θ) = sqrt(2 cos²(θ/2)) = √2 |cos(θ/2)|. Assuming θ is acute, cos(θ/2) is positive.

Thus, sqrt(1 + cos θ) = √2 cos(θ/2)

And sin θ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)

Plugging back:

cos(angle 3) = [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] / [ √2 * √2 cos(θ/2) ] = [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] / [2 cos(θ/2)] ] = sin(θ/2)

Thus, cos(angle 3) = sin(θ/2)

But angle 3 is between 0 and π, so angle 3 = arccos(sin(θ/2)).

Hmm, not sure if this helps directly, but let's keep this in mind.

Earlier, for angle 2, we had cos(angle 2) = √(1 - cos θ)/√2. Let me try to express this in terms of θ/2.

Using identity 1 - cos θ = 2 sin²(θ/2), so √(1 - cos θ) = √(2) |sin(θ/2)|. Assuming θ is between 0 and π, sin(θ/2) is positive.

Thus, √(1 - cos θ)/√2 = √(2) sin(θ/2) / √2 = sin(θ/2).

So cos(angle 2) = sin(θ/2). But cos(angle 2) = sin(θ/2) => angle 2 = arccos(sin(θ/2)).

Wait, this seems conflicting. Wait, earlier for angle 2, we had cos(angle 2) = √(1 - cos θ)/√2 = sin(θ/2). So angle 2 = arccos(sin(θ/2)).

But also, for angle 3, we had cos(angle 3) = sin(θ/2). Therefore, angle 3 = arccos(sin(θ/2)).

Wait, but this suggests that angle 2 = angle 3? But according to the problem statement, angle 2 = 2x and angle 3 = x. So this would imply angle 2 = 2 angle 3, i.e., angle 3 = angle 2 / 2. But according to the above, angle 2 and angle 3 have the same cosine, implying they are equal or supplementary. But since both angles are between 0 and 180°, they could be equal or supplementary. But given the context, probably they are equal, which contradicts the problem's assertion that angle 2 = 2x and angle 3 = x. So there must be a mistake here.

Wait, let me check again.

From earlier steps:

For angle 2, we had cos(angle 2) = sin(θ/2)

For angle 3, we had cos(angle 3) = sin(θ/2)

Therefore, cos(angle 2) = cos(angle 3) ⇒ angle 2 = angle 3 or angle 2 = -angle 3 (mod 360°). Since angles are between 0 and 180°, angle 2 = angle 3 or angle 2 = 360° - angle 3, but since both are positive and less than 180°, it must be angle 2 = angle 3. But this conflicts with the problem's statement that angle 2 = 2x and angle 3 = x. So this suggests that there's a contradiction unless angle 2 = angle 3, implying x = 2x ⇒ x=0, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be an error in my reasoning.

Where did I go wrong? Let me revisit the calculation for angle 2 and angle 3.

For angle 2, I said cos(angle 2) = sin(θ/2). For angle 3, cos(angle 3) = sin(θ/2). So both angles have the same cosine. But if angle 2 and angle 3 are both acute angles (as they are angles in a triangle), then they must be equal. But the problem says angle 2 = 2x and angle 3 = x. Hence, this suggests that my analysis is missing something.

Perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the angle for angle 2 or angle 3. Let me re-examine the calculation for angle 2.

Earlier, for angle 2, I had vectors GH and GB. Let me try to calculate angle 2 using coordinates.

Point G is (4,0). Point H is (4 cos θ, 4 sin θ). Point B is (4 cos θ, 0).

So vector GH is H - G = (4 cos θ - 4, 4 sin θ - 0) = (4(cos θ - 1), 4 sin θ).

Vector GB is B - G = (4 cos θ - 4, 0 - 0) = (4(cos θ - 1), 0).

So the angle between vectors GH and GB is angle 2.

The formula for the angle between two vectors u and v is:

cos(angle) = (u ⋅ v) / (|u| |v|)

Calculate u ⋅ v = [4(cos θ - 1)][4(cos θ - 1)] + [4 sin θ][0] = 16 (cos θ - 1)^2

|u| = sqrt[ (4(cos θ - 1))^2 + (4 sin θ)^2 ] = 4 sqrt{(cos θ - 1)^2 + sin²θ} = 4 sqrt{cos²θ - 2 cos θ + 1 + sin²θ} = 4 sqrt{2 - 2 cos θ} as before.

|v| = sqrt[ (4(cos θ - 1))^2 + 0 ] = 4 |cos θ - 1| = 4(1 - cos θ) since cos θ ≤ 1.

Thus, cos(angle 2) = [16 (cos θ - 1)^2] / [4 sqrt(2 - 2 cos θ) * 4(1 - cos θ)] = [16 (1 - cos θ)^2] / [16 sqrt(2(1 - cos θ)) * (1 - cos θ)] = [ (1 - cos θ)^2 ] / [ sqrt(2(1 - cos θ)) * (1 - cos θ) ] = [ (1 - cos θ)^2 ] / [ sqrt(2) * (1 - cos θ)^{3/2} ] = (1 - cos θ)^{1/2} / sqrt(2) = sqrt(1 - cos θ)/sqrt(2).

As before. Now, let's use the identity 1 - cos θ = 2 sin²(θ/2), so sqrt(1 - cos θ) = sqrt(2) |sin(θ/2)|. Assuming θ is in range where sin(θ/2) is positive (say θ ∈ (0, π)), then:

sqrt(1 - cos θ)/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) sin(θ/2)/sqrt(2) = sin(θ/2).

Thus, cos(angle 2) = sin(θ/2). Similarly, for angle 3, we had cos(angle 3) = sin(θ/2). So both angles have the same cosine, implying they are equal or supplementary. Since both angles are between 0 and π, and assuming they are acute, they are equal. But according to the problem, angle 2 = 2x and angle 3 = x, so angle 2 = 2 angle 3. This suggests that angle 2 = angle 3, leading to 2x = x ⇒ x = 0, which is impossible. This contradiction indicates an error in assumptions.

Wait, but maybe angle 3 is not the same as angle 2. Let me re-examine angle 3.

Angle 3 is angle JHB, which is at point H between J and B. Let me re-calculate this.

Earlier, I computed vectors HJ and HB. Vector HJ is from H to J: J - H = (-4 - 4 cos θ, 0 - 4 sin θ). Vector HB is from H to B: B - H = (4 cos θ - 4 cos θ, 0 - 4 sin θ) = (0, -4 sin θ).

So the angle between HJ and HB is angle 3.

Let me recalculate the dot product:

HJ ⋅ HB = (-4(1 + cos θ)) * 0 + (-4 sin θ) * (-4 sin θ) = 0 + 16 sin²θ = 16 sin²θ.

|HJ| = sqrt[ (-4(1 + cos θ))^2 + (-4 sin θ)^2 ] = 4 sqrt[(1 + cos θ)^2 + sin²θ] = 4 sqrt[1 + 2 cos θ + cos²θ + sin²θ] = 4 sqrt[2 + 2 cos θ] = 4√(2(1 + cos θ)).

|HB| = sqrt[0^2 + (-4 sin θ)^2] = 4 |sin θ| = 4 sin θ (assuming θ in (0, π)).

So cos(angle 3) = (16 sin²θ) / [4√(2(1 + cos θ)) * 4 sin θ] = [16 sin²θ] / [16 sin θ √(2(1 + cos θ))] = sin θ / √(2(1 + cos θ)).

Now, simplify this expression. Use identity 1 + cos θ = 2 cos²(θ/2), and sin θ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So:

sin θ / √(2(1 + cos θ)) = [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] / √[2 * 2 cos²(θ/2)] = [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] / √[4 cos²(θ/2)] = [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] / [2 |cos(θ/2)|] = [sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] / |cos(θ/2)|.

Since θ is in (0, π), θ/2 is in (0, π/2), so cos(θ/2) is positive. Thus, this becomes sin(θ/2).

So cos(angle 3) = sin(θ/2), same as for angle 2. Hence, angle 2 = angle 3. But this contradicts the problem's condition that angle 2 = 2x and angle 3 = x. This suggests that either there's a mistake in the problem setup, or I'm missing a key insight.

Wait, but maybe angle 3 is not the angle I calculated. Let me double-check the definition of angle 3. The problem says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B, J, H)), MeasureOf(angle 3)). So angle at H, between B, J, H. Wait, no. Angle(B, J, H) is the angle at J between B, J, H? Or at H?

Wait, in standard notation, Angle(B, J, H) is the angle at J, between points B, J, H. Wait, no. The middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(B, J, H) is the angle at J between points B, J, H. Wait, but earlier I calculated angle at H. This is a critical mistake!

Oh no! I misinterpreted the angle. Let me re-express:

Angle(B, J, H) is the angle at J between points B, J, H. So it's ∠BJH, not ∠JHB. Previously, I calculated ∠JHB, which is at H, but it should be at J.

This changes everything! I incorrectly assumed it was at H, but it's at J. Let me correct this.

So angle 3 is ∠BJH, at point J, between points B, J, H.

Let me recalculate angle 3. So angle at J between B, J, H.

Points:

- B is (4 cos θ, 0)

- J is (-4, 0)

- H is (4 cos θ, 4 sin θ)

So vectors JB and JH.

Vector JB is from J to B: (4 cos θ - (-4), 0 - 0) = (4 cos θ + 4, 0)

Vector JH is from J to H: (4 cos θ - (-4), 4 sin θ - 0) = (4 cos θ + 4, 4 sin θ)

So angle between vectors JB and JH at point J is angle 3.

Let me compute this angle using dot product.

Let me denote vector JB as u = (4 cos θ + 4, 0)

Vector JH as v = (4 cos θ + 4, 4 sin θ)

Dot product u ⋅ v = (4 cos θ + 4)^2 + 0 * 4 sin θ = (4 (cos θ + 1))^2

|u| = sqrt[(4 (cos θ + 1))^2 + 0^2] = 4 (cos θ + 1)

|v| = sqrt[(4 (cos θ + 1))^2 + (4 sin θ)^2] = 4 sqrt{(cos θ + 1)^2 + sin²θ} = 4 sqrt{cos²θ + 2 cos θ + 1 + sin²θ} = 4 sqrt{2 + 2 cos θ} = 4√(2(1 + cos θ))

Thus, cos(angle 3) = [ (4 (cos θ + 1))^2 ] / [4 (cos θ + 1) * 4√(2(1 + cos θ)) ] = [16 (cos θ + 1)^2] / [16 (cos θ + 1) √(2(1 + cos θ)) ] = [ (cos θ + 1) ] / √(2(1 + cos θ)) = √(1 + cos θ) / √2

Thus, cos(angle 3) = √(1 + cos θ)/√2

Now, let's compare this with angle 2.

Previously, for angle 2, we had cos(angle 2) = √(1 - cos θ)/√2.

So now, angle 2 and angle 3 have cosines of √(1 - cos θ)/√2 and √(1 + cos θ)/√2 respectively.

Let me denote:

cos(angle 2) = √(1 - cos θ)/√2

cos(angle 3) = √(1 + cos θ)/√2

Now, let's use identities to simplify these expressions.

Recall that 1 - cos θ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and 1 + cos θ = 2 cos²(θ/2).

So:

cos(angle 2) = √(2 sin²(θ/2))/√2 = (sqrt(2) |sin(θ/2)|)/√2 = |sin(θ/2)|. Since θ is between 0 and π, sin(θ/2) is non-negative, so cos(angle 2) = sin(θ/2).

Similarly, cos(angle 3) = √(2 cos²(θ/2))/√2 = (sqrt(2) |cos(θ/2)|)/√2 = |cos(θ/2)|. Again, since θ is between 0 and π, θ/2 is between 0 and π/2, so cos(θ/2) is positive. Thus, cos(angle 3) = cos(θ/2).

Therefore, angle 2 = arccos(sin(θ/2)) and angle 3 = arccos(cos(θ/2)) = θ/2.

So angle 3 = θ/2.

Now, angle 2 = arccos(sin(θ/2)). Let's simplify this.

Note that sin(φ) = cos(π/2 - φ). So sin(θ/2) = cos(π/2 - θ/2). Therefore, arccos(sin(θ/2)) = π/2 - θ/2, assuming θ/2 is in [0, π/2], which it is.

Thus, angle 2 = π/2 - θ/2.

But angle 3 = θ/2.

So angle 2 + angle 3 = π/2 - θ/2 + θ/2 = π/2. So angle 2 + angle 3 = 90 degrees.

According to the problem, angle 2 = 2x and angle 3 = x. So 2x + x = 90° ⇒ 3x = 90° ⇒ x = 30°, so angle 2 = 2x = 60°, which is option C.

Yes! This matches. So the measure of angle 2 is 60 degrees, so the answer is C.

Let me verify this with an example. Let's take θ = 60°, then angle 3 = θ/2 = 30°, angle 2 = 90° - 30° = 60°, which fits 2x = 60° ⇒ x = 30°, so angle 3 = x = 30°. Correct.

Another example: θ = 90°, then angle 3 = 45°, angle 2 = 45°, but this would mean 2x = 45°, x = 22.5°, but angle 3 is 45°, which would violate the condition angle 3 = x. Wait, but in this case, θ = 90°, so angle 3 = θ/2 = 45°, and angle 2 = 90° - 45° = 45°, which would mean angle 2 = angle 3, violating the problem's condition. This suggests that θ is chosen such that angle 2 = 2x and angle 3 = x, which only occurs when angle 2 + angle 3 = 90°, and angle 2 = 2x, angle 3 = x. So this holds for any θ, as long as the relationship holds. Wait, but how does this work?

Wait, the problem states that angle 2 = 2x and angle 3 = x. From our derivation, angle 2 + angle 3 = 90°, so 2x + x = 90° ⇒ x = 30°, so angle 2 = 60°. This is independent of θ, as long as the configuration holds. Hence, the measure of angle 2 is 60°, so the answer is C.

### Step-by-Step Derivation:

We are given a geometric configuration involving several points on a circle with center $ A $, and certain angular relationships among lines and points. Our goal is to find the measure of $\angle 2$, which is denoted as $2x$, while $\angle 3$ is $x$. The key relationships include:

---

#### **Geometric Constraints:**

1. **Points on the Circle:**  
   Points $ J, G, H, F $ lie on a circle centered at $ A $ with radius 4.  
   This implies that all these points are equidistant from $ A $, and thus, quadrilateral $ JGFH $ is cyclic.

2. **Perpendicular Relationships:**
   - $ \overline{GB} \perp \overline{HB} $
   - $ \overline{HG} \perp \overline{JH} $

   These suggest that certain angles formed at intersections are right angles.

3. **Point $ B $ Lies on:**
   - Line $ \overline{JG} $
   - Line $ \overline{HF} $

   So, $ B $ is the intersection of chords $ \overline{JG} $ and $ \overline{HF} $.

4. **Angles:**
   - $ \angle HGB = \angle 2 $
   - $ \angle FHB = \angle 1 $
   - $ \angle B J H = \angle 3 $

---

### Coordinate Geometry Setup:

To simplify computations, we assign coordinates based on the circular symmetry:

- Place $ A $ at the origin $(0, 0)$.
- Let $ J = (-4, 0) $, $ G = (4, 0) $ — these are endpoints of a diameter.
- Let $ H = (4\cos\theta, 4\sin\theta) $, a point on the circle.
- By the perpendicularity condition $ \overline{HG} \perp \overline{JH} $, the point $ B $ lies on the x-axis (line $ \overline{JG} $) and has coordinates $ B = (4\cos\theta, 0) $.

---

### Computing Angles:

#### **Angle 2 ($ \angle HGB $):**

- Vectors involved:
  - $ \vec{GH} = (4\cos\theta - 4, 4\sin\theta) $
  - $ \vec{GB} = (4\cos\theta - 4, 0) $

- Compute $ \cos(\angle 2) $ using the dot product:
  $$
  \cos(\angle 2) = \frac{\vec{GH} \cdot \vec{GB}}{|\vec{GH}| |\vec{GB}|}
  $$

  After simplification using trigonometric identities:
  $$
  \cos(\angle 2) = \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
  $$

  Therefore,
  $$
  \angle 2 = \arccos\left(\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \frac{\theta}{2}
  $$

---

#### **Angle 3 ($ \angle B J H $):**

- Vectors involved:
  - $ \vec{JB} = (4\cos\theta + 4, 0) $
  - $ \vec{JH} = (4\cos\theta + 4, 4\sin\theta) $

- Using dot product again, we derive:
  $$
  \cos(\angle 3) = \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
  $$

  So,
  $$
  \angle 3 = \frac{\theta}{2}
  $$

---

### Solving the System:

We are told:
$$
\angle 2 = 2x,\quad \angle 3 = x
$$

From above:
$$
\angle 2 + \angle 3 = \frac{\pi}{2}
$$
$$
2x + x = \frac{\pi}{2} \Rightarrow 3x = \frac{\pi}{2} \Rightarrow x = \frac{\pi}{6}
$$

So:
$$
\angle 2 = 2x = \frac{\pi}{3} = 60^\circ
$$

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{C}
$$
