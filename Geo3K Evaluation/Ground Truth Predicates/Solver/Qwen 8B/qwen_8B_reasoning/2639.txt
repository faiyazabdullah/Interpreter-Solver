MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. Hmm, first I need to visualize the diagram based on the given constraints. Let me jot down all the information step by step.

We have points P, Q, M, N, A, B, C involved. The key constraints are:

1. Length of line QP is 4x - 8.
2. Length of line QM is 2x + 2.
3. Point P lies on line NA.
4. Point M lies on line NB.
5. Point Q lies on line NC.
6. Line PN is perpendicular to PQ.
7. Line MQ is perpendicular to MN.
8. Angle at N between M and Q equals angle at N between Q and P (i.e., ∠MQN = ∠QNP).

Wait, so angles at point N? Let me parse that again. The measure of angle (M, N, Q) is equal to measure of angle (Q, N, P). So ∠MNQ equals ∠QNP?

But maybe it's better to draw a rough sketch mentally. Let me think about coordinates. Since there are perpendicular lines and lengths given, coordinate geometry might help here.

Let me assume point N as the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, since PN is perpendicular to PQ, and MQ is perpendicular to MN. Also, points P, M lie on lines NA, NB respectively, and Q is on NC. 

Let me consider coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to make things easier. Let me set N at (0,0). Since PN is perpendicular to PQ, and PQ is connected to point Q which is on NC. Also, MQ is perpendicular to MN. Wait, MN is a line from M to N, which is the same as the line from N to M. So if MN is a line, then MQ is perpendicular to MN. Therefore, the slope of MQ times the slope of MN should be -1.

Similarly, PN is perpendicular to PQ. So slope of PN * slope of PQ = -1.

Also, since points P and M lie on lines NA and NB respectively, and Q lies on NC. So lines NA, NB, NC are three different lines through N. Maybe they form some sort of triangle or something?

Alternatively, perhaps triangles NPQ and NMQ have some relations due to the right angles?

Wait, let's think about the angles. Given that ∠MNQ = ∠QNP. Let me see. At point N, we have two angles: one formed by M-N-Q and another by Q-N-P. These are equal. So maybe triangles involving those angles are similar?

But how can I relate the sides? Maybe using trigonometry or coordinate geometry.

Since there are perpendiculars, maybe right triangles are involved. For example, since PN ⊥ PQ, triangle PNQ is a right triangle at N. Similarly, since MQ ⊥ MN, triangle MNQ is a right triangle at N. Wait, no. If MQ is perpendicular to MN, then triangle MNQ would have a right angle at N? Because MN and MQ are perpendicular. Yes! So both triangles PNQ and MNQ are right triangles at N.

So, triangle PNQ has right angle at N, and triangle MNQ also has right angle at N. Therefore, both triangles share the hypotenuse NQ? Or wait, no. In triangle PNQ, the right angle is at N, so legs are PN and NQ. Wait, no. Wait, PN is perpendicular to PQ. Wait, the right angle is at N? Let me clarify.

If line PN is perpendicular to line PQ, then the angle between PN and PQ is 90 degrees. But PN is a segment from P to N, and PQ is from P to Q. Wait, but if PN is perpendicular to PQ, then the angle at P between PN and PQ is 90 degrees. Wait, maybe my earlier thought was wrong. Let me re-examine.

The constraint says Perpendicular(Line(P,N), Line(P,Q)). That means that the line PN is perpendicular to the line PQ. So these two lines intersect at point P, and form a right angle there. So the angle at P between PN and PQ is 90 degrees. Therefore, triangle PNQ has a right angle at P, not at N. Wait, but that contradicts my previous assumption. So I need to correct that.

Similarly, Perpendicular(Line(M,Q), Line(M,N)) implies that at point M, the lines MQ and MN are perpendicular. So the angle at M between MQ and MN is 90 degrees. So triangle MNQ has a right angle at M.

Therefore, triangles PNQ (right-angled at P) and MNQ (right-angled at M). And angles ∠MNQ and ∠QNP are equal. Let me try to represent this.

Given that ∠MNQ = ∠QNP. Let me denote ∠MNQ as the angle at N between M and Q. Wait, the angle ∠MNQ is at point N, between points M, N, Q. So vertex at N, with segments NM and NQ. Similarly, ∠QNP is at point N between Q, N, P. So vertex at N, segments NQ and NP.

So these two angles at N are equal. So ∠MNQ = ∠QNP. Let me denote them as θ.

Now, considering triangles MNQ and QNP. Wait, triangle MNQ has a right angle at M, and triangle QNP has a right angle at P. Are there similar triangles here?

Alternatively, maybe using trigonometric ratios. Let's consider triangle MNQ: right-angled at M. So tan(angle at N) = opposite/adjacent = MQ / MN. Similarly, in triangle QNP, right-angled at P: tan(angle at N) = NP / PQ.

But since ∠MNQ = ∠QNP = θ, then tan(theta) in both cases is equal.

So tan(theta) = MQ / MN = NP / PQ.

But how do I find NP and MN? Well, maybe express them in terms of x?

Wait, but I don't know the positions of points yet. However, there are constraints on the lengths QP and QM. Let me note that QP = 4x - 8 and QM = 2x + 2. So maybe I can relate these with the triangles?

Wait, in triangle QNP (right-angled at P): PQ is one leg, NP is another leg, and NQ is hypotenuse. Similarly, in triangle MNQ (right-angled at M): MQ is one leg, MN is another leg, and NQ is hypotenuse. Wait, but in triangle MNQ, hypotenuse would be NQ. So in triangle MNQ, legs are MN and MQ, hypotenuse NQ. In triangle QNP, legs are NP and PQ, hypotenuse NQ. Therefore, NQ is common hypotenuse for both triangles.

Therefore, from Pythagoras:

For triangle QNP: NQ² = NP² + PQ².

For triangle MNQ: NQ² = MN² + MQ².

Therefore, equating these two expressions:

NP² + PQ² = MN² + MQ².

Hmm, that seems useful. But I don't know NP or MN. However, maybe there's a relation between NP and MN via the angles?

Earlier, we had that tan(theta) = MQ / MN = NP / PQ. So MQ/MN = NP/PQ → cross multiplying gives MQ * PQ = NP * MN. But I still don't know NP or MN. However, maybe there's another way.

Alternatively, since angles theta are equal, and triangles involve those angles... Maybe similarity?

Looking back at the triangles. Triangle MNQ has right angle at M, and angle theta at N. Triangle QNP has right angle at P, and angle theta at N. So maybe these two triangles are similar?

Because both have a right angle and share angle theta. So yes, they are similar. Therefore, their corresponding sides are proportional.

In triangle MNQ: right-angled at M, with angle theta at N. So sides: MN (adjacent to theta), MQ (opposite to theta), hypotenuse NQ.

In triangle QNP: right-angled at P, with angle theta at N. So sides: NP (adjacent to theta), PQ (opposite to theta), hypotenuse NQ.

So the ratio of sides:

In triangle MNQ: adjacent / opposite = MN / MQ = cot(theta)

In triangle QNP: adjacent / opposite = NP / PQ = cot(theta)

Thus, MN / MQ = NP / PQ → MN * PQ = NP * MQ.

Which is the same equation as before.

But without more info, how can we proceed? Let me think if there are other relationships.

Also, remember that points P and M lie on lines NA and NB respectively, and Q lies on NC. So lines NA, NB, NC pass through N. Perhaps there is some collinearity or proportionality?

Alternatively, maybe coordinates can help. Let me try assigning coordinates again, carefully.

Let me place N at (0,0). Let me define coordinates for other points.

First, since PN is perpendicular to PQ. Let me suppose that point P is somewhere, and PQ is such that PN ⊥ PQ.

Let me assume coordinates for simplicity. Let me take N at (0,0). Let me assume that line NA is along some direction; since P lies on NA, let me parametrize it.

But maybe choosing specific directions for simplicity. Suppose line NA is the x-axis. So line NA is horizontal. Then point P lies on NA, which is the x-axis. So coordinates of P could be (a, 0) for some a.

Similarly, line NB could be another axis, say y-axis? But then point M lies on NB, which would be vertical. But then line MN would be vertical, and MQ is perpendicular to MN, meaning MQ would be horizontal. But need to check consistency.

Alternatively, perhaps lines NA, NB, NC are arbitrary, but since Q lies on NC, which connects to N. Maybe I need to use vectors or slopes.

Alternatively, since there are multiple points lying on lines through N, maybe using vectors with N as origin.

Let me try coordinates again. Let me fix N at (0,0). Let me assume that line NA is the x-axis, so P lies on x-axis. Let me denote P as (p, 0). Since PN is perpendicular to PQ. The vector PN is from P to N, which is (-p, 0). The vector PQ is from P to Q. Let me denote Q as (q_x, q_y). Then vector PQ is (q_x - p, q_y - 0) = (q_x - p, q_y). For PN and PQ to be perpendicular, their dot product must be zero.

PN · PQ = (-p)(q_x - p) + 0*(q_y) = -p(q_x - p) = 0. So either p=0 or q_x - p = 0. But if p=0, then P would be at (0,0), which is N, but that's impossible because P is a distinct point. Hence, q_x - p = 0 ⇒ q_x = p. Therefore, the x-coordinate of Q is equal to that of P. So Q has coordinates (p, q_y).

So Q lies vertically above or below P on the vertical line passing through P. But since Q is on line NC, which passes through N(0,0). Therefore, line NC goes from N(0,0) through Q(p, q_y). Therefore, line NC has direction vector (p, q_y). So parametric equations for line NC: t*p, t*q_y, where t is real number.

Now, point Q is on line NC. Since Q is (p, q_y), then for some parameter t, p = t*p and q_y = t*q_y. This holds for t=1, so Q is at t=1 on line NC. So that's consistent.

Now, moving to the other condition: Perpendicular(Line(M, Q), Line(M, N)). So line MQ is perpendicular to line MN. Let me find coordinates for M.

Since M lies on line NB. Let me assume line NB is some line through N(0,0). Let me choose coordinates for simplicity. Let me suppose that line NB is the y-axis, so M lies on y-axis. Then coordinates of M would be (0, m) for some m.

Then line MN is from M(0,m) to N(0,0), which is vertical line x=0. Then line MQ is from M(0,m) to Q(p, q_y). For these lines to be perpendicular, the slope of MQ multiplied by slope of MN should be -1.

Slope of MN is undefined (vertical line), so the line MQ must be horizontal. Therefore, slope of MQ is zero. Which requires that the y-coordinate of Q equals the y-coordinate of M. So q_y = m. Thus, Q is (p, m), and M is (0, m). Therefore, MQ is horizontal line from (0, m) to (p, m), which is indeed horizontal, hence perpendicular to vertical MN.

So with this setup:

- N is (0,0)
- P is (p, 0)
- Q is (p, m)
- M is (0, m)

This satisfies the perpendicular conditions: PN (from P to N) is horizontal leftward, PQ is vertical upward, so they are perpendicular. MQ is horizontal rightward, MN is vertical downward, so they are perpendicular.

Great, so this coordinate system works. Now, let's verify the angle condition: ∠MNQ = ∠QNP.

First, compute ∠MNQ. This is the angle at N between points M, N, Q. Points M(0,m), N(0,0), Q(p, m). So vectors NM and NQ.

Vector NM is from N to M: (0 - 0, m - 0) = (0, m)

Vector NQ is from N to Q: (p - 0, m - 0) = (p, m)

Angle between NM (which is straight up along y-axis) and NQ (vector (p, m)). The angle between these two vectors is θ, which is ∠MNQ.

Similarly, ∠QNP is the angle at N between Q, N, P. Points Q(p, m), N(0,0), P(p, 0). Vectors NQ and NP.

Vector NQ is (p, m) as before.

Vector NP is from N to P: (p, 0)

So angle between NQ and NP is ∠QNP.

So we need these two angles θ1 (∠MNQ) and θ2 (∠QNP) to be equal.

Compute tan(theta1) and tan(theta2):

For θ1: angle between NM (along positive y-axis) and NQ (vector (p, m)). The tangent of this angle is the ratio of the x-component over y-component when projecting onto axes. Alternatively, since NM is along y-axis, the angle between NM and NQ is the angle whose tangent is (horizontal component)/(vertical component) of NQ relative to NM. So tan(theta1) = p/m.

For θ2: angle between NQ (vector (p, m)) and NP (vector (p, 0)). The angle between these two vectors. The tangent of this angle is the difference in slopes? Or compute using vectors.

The formula for tan(theta) between two vectors u and v is |u × v| / (u ⋅ v). Wait, actually, tan(theta) = sin(theta)/cos(theta). Where sin(theta) is magnitude of cross product divided by |u||v|, and cos(theta) is dot product divided by |u||v|. So tan(theta) = |u × v| / (u ⋅ v).

But since we're dealing with angles between vectors, and assuming theta is acute, we can compute tan(theta) as follows.

For vectors NQ (p, m) and NP (p, 0):

Cross product (in 2D, magnitude is scalar): p*0 - m*p = -mp. Absolute value is | -mp | = |mp|.

Dot product: p*p + m*0 = p².

So tan(theta2) = |mp| / p² = |m| / p.

But earlier, tan(theta1) was p/m. So setting tan(theta1) = tan(theta2):

p/m = |m| / p.

Assuming all quantities are positive (since lengths are positive, and coordinates can be chosen accordingly), we can drop absolute value:

p/m = m/p → p² = m² → p = ±m. But since p and m are lengths in coordinates, depending on direction. Assuming p > 0 and m > 0 (as points are placed in upper half-plane), then p = m.

Therefore, p = m. So the coordinates are:

- P is (p, 0)
- Q is (p, p)
- M is (0, p)

Now, we can compute the lengths QP and QM.

QP is the distance between Q(p,p) and P(p,0). That's sqrt[(p-p)^2 + (p - 0)^2] = sqrt[0 + p²] = p. According to the problem, QP = 4x - 8. So p = 4x - 8.

QM is the distance between Q(p,p) and M(0,p). That's sqrt[(p - 0)^2 + (p - p)^2] = sqrt[p² + 0] = p. According to the problem, QM = 2x + 2. So p = 2x + 2.

Therefore, we have:

From QP: p = 4x - 8  
From QM: p = 2x + 2  

Setting them equal: 4x - 8 = 2x + 2  
Subtract 2x from both sides: 2x - 8 = 2  
Add 8 to both sides: 2x = 10  
Divide by 2: x = 5  

Then, substituting back into QM = 2x + 2: 2(5) + 2 = 10 + 2 = 12. Therefore, QM is 12. Looking at the answer choices, option C is 12. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because QM is p, which equals 2x + 2. When x=5, that gives 12. Correct. So the answer is C.

But just to confirm, let me check if there were any assumptions that might affect this. We assumed that p and m are positive, which they are. Also, the angle equality led us to p=m, which is valid. All steps seem logical.

Yes, so the answer is C. 12.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the length of $ QM $, we start by analyzing the geometric configuration and applying algebraic reasoning grounded in the given constraints.

---

### Step 1: Coordinate Assignment and Geometry Setup

We are told that:

- $ \text{Length}(QP) = 4x - 8 $
- $ \text{Length}(QM) = 2x + 2 $
- Several points lie on specific lines through $ N $, with perpendicularity conditions between certain segments.
- Angles $ \angle MNQ $ and $ \angle QNP $ are equal.

Let’s simplify the situation by placing **point $ N $** at the origin $(0, 0)$ for convenience.

Assume:

- Point $ P $ lies on line $ NA $, which we align with the x-axis, so $ P = (p, 0) $
- Point $ Q $ lies on line $ NC $, which we will align with the vertical line through $ P $, so $ Q = (p, q) $
- Point $ M $ lies on line $ NB $, which we align with the y-axis, so $ M = (0, q) $

This setup ensures:

- $ \overrightarrow{PN} $ is horizontal, $ \overrightarrow{PQ} $ is vertical ⟹ they are perpendicular
- $ \overrightarrow{MQ} $ is horizontal, $ \overrightarrow{MN} $ is vertical ⟹ they are perpendicular

---

### Step 2: Use the Equal Angle Condition

We are given that:

$$
\angle MNQ = \angle QNP
$$

Using the coordinates:

- Vector $ \vec{NM} = (0, q) $
- Vector $ \vec{NQ} = (p, q) $
- Vector $ \vec{NP} = (p, 0) $

The angle between $ \vec{NM} $ and $ \vec{NQ} $ corresponds to $ \angle MNQ $, while the angle between $ \vec{NQ} $ and $ \vec{NP} $ corresponds to $ \angle QNP $. Using the tangent of these angles:

- $ \tan(\angle MNQ) = \frac{p}{q} $
- $ \tan(\angle QNP) = \frac{q}{p} $

Equating the tangents (since the angles are equal):

$$
\frac{p}{q} = \frac{q}{p} \Rightarrow p^2 = q^2 \Rightarrow p = q
$$

So, we conclude that $ p = q $.

---

### Step 3: Compute Lengths Using Coordinates

With $ p = q $, the coordinates become:

- $ P = (p, 0) $
- $ Q = (p, p) $
- $ M = (0, p) $

Now compute distances:

- $ QP = \sqrt{(p - p)^2 + (p - 0)^2} = \sqrt{p^2} = p $
- $ QM = \sqrt{(p - 0)^2 + (p - p)^2} = \sqrt{p^2} = p $

Given:

- $ QP = 4x - 8 \Rightarrow p = 4x - 8 $
- $ QM = 2x + 2 \Rightarrow p = 2x + 2 $

Set the two expressions for $ p $ equal:

$$
4x - 8 = 2x + 2
$$

Solving:

$$
4x - 2x = 2 + 8 \Rightarrow 2x = 10 \Rightarrow x = 5
$$

Now substitute $ x = 5 $ into $ QM = 2x + 2 $:

$$
QM = 2(5) + 2 = 12
$$

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{\text{C}}
$$
