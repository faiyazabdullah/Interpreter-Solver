MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, first, I need to understand the given constraints and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by breaking down the information provided.

The problem states several geometric constraints:

1. Point L lies on line YX. Wait, actually, it says "PointLiesOnLine(M, Line(Y, X))". Hmm, maybe that means point M is on the line connecting points Y and X? Or maybe there's a typo here? Let me check again. Oh, right, the way it's written is "PointLiesOnLine(M, Line(Y, X))", which probably translates to point M lying on the line segment (or line) between Y and X. Similarly, PointN lies on the line segment (or line) between X and Z. Also, lines YZ and MN are parallel.

Then we have some lengths: XM = 4, XN = 6, NZ = 9. We need to find XY.

Wait, so variables here are points: X, Y, Z, M, N. The lines mentioned are Line(Y,X), Line(X,Z), Line(Y,Z), Line(M,N). And the relationships are that M is on line YX, N is on line XZ, and lines YZ and MN are parallel.

So perhaps drawing a diagram would help. But since I can't draw, I'll visualize it.

Let me think about coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to these points could make things clearer. Since there are lines and distances involved, coordinate geometry might be useful here.

Let me assume that points are arranged in such a way that we can assign coordinates based on the given distances. Let me consider placing point X at the origin for simplicity. Let's set up a coordinate system where point X is at (0, 0).

Now, since M lies on line YX. Wait, line YX connects points Y and X. If X is at (0,0), then line YX would be a straight line passing through Y and X. Similarly, N lies on line XZ, which connects X and Z. Then, lines YZ and MN are parallel.

But we also know specific distances: XM = 4, XN = 6, NZ = 9. Let me parse these.

First, XM is the distance from X to M. Since M is on line YX, which passes through X and Y. So, if X is at (0,0), then Y is somewhere along the same line as X and M. Let me suppose that line YX is horizontal for simplicity, but maybe I should use coordinates more carefully.

Alternatively, since lines YZ and MN are parallel, perhaps similar triangles come into play here?

Wait, let's think step by step.

First, assign coordinates. Let me fix coordinate system:

Let’s place point X at (0, 0).

Since M lies on line YX. Let me denote the coordinates of Y as (a, b) and X is (0,0). Then, line YX goes from Y(a,b) to X(0,0). Any point on this line can be parametrized. For example, point M is on this line. The distance from X to M is 4. So, the length XM = 4. Let me think about coordinates for M.

Parametrize line YX. Let me express vector from X to Y as (a, b). Then, any point on line YX can be expressed as t*(a, b) where t is a scalar. However, since X is at (0,0), when t=0, you get X, and when t=1, you get Y. But depending on direction, t could be positive or negative.

But the distance from X to M is 4. Let me suppose that M divides the line YX in some ratio. But without knowing the exact position of Y, it's hard to say. Alternatively, maybe using vectors or coordinate geometry.

Alternatively, since N lies on line XZ. Let me denote point Z as (c, d). Then line XZ connects X(0,0) to Z(c,d). Point N is on this line, and the distance from X to N is 6. So, the coordinates of N would be proportional to the vector from X to Z. Let me think.

But then we have another piece of information: NZ = 9. So the distance from N to Z is 9. Since N is on line XZ, the total length XZ is equal to XN + NZ if N is between X and Z. Wait, but if N is between X and Z, then XN + NZ = XZ. However, if N is beyond Z, then XN would be longer than XZ, but here XN is 6 and NZ is 9, so total XZ would be |XN - NZ| if N is beyond Z. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify whether N is between X and Z or not. Hmm, but usually, unless specified otherwise, points on a line segment are considered between the endpoints. However, in the problem statement, it just says "PointLiesOnLine(N, Line(X, Z))", which implies that N is on the infinite line XZ, not necessarily between X and Z. Therefore, N could be extended beyond Z or before X. However, since NZ is given as 9, and XN is 6, we need to determine the relative positions.

But perhaps we can proceed with coordinates. Let me define coordinates for all points.

Let me take X as (0, 0).

Let me assume line XZ has some direction. Let me assign coordinates to Z. Suppose that line XZ is along the x-axis for simplicity. Wait, but then line YX is another line. However, since lines YZ and MN are parallel, their slopes must be equal.

Alternatively, maybe I need to use vectors or coordinate systems with variables.

Alternatively, since lines YZ and MN are parallel, the slope of YZ equals the slope of MN.

Let me attempt to assign coordinates step by step.

Set X at (0, 0). Let me define line XZ. Let me assume that Z is at (k, 0) for some k. Then, line XZ is the x-axis. Then, point N is on line XZ. Given that XN = 6 and NZ = 9. Depending on the position of N, if N is between X and Z, then XZ would be XN + NZ = 6 + 9 = 15. Therefore, Z would be at (15, 0), and N would be at (6, 0). But wait, if N is between X and Z, then XN = 6, so N is at (6, 0), and Z is at (6 + 9) = 15, so Z is at (15, 0). However, if N is beyond Z, then XN would be longer than XZ. Since XN is 6 and NZ is 9, then XN would be XZ + ZN, meaning XN = XZ + NZ → 6 = XZ + 9 → XZ = -3, which doesn't make sense because distances are positive. Hence, N must lie between X and Z. Thus, Z is at (15, 0), N is at (6, 0). That seems plausible.

So, coordinates:

- X = (0, 0)

- N = (6, 0)

- Z = (15, 0)

Now, moving on. Now, point M lies on line YX. Let me assume that line YX is some arbitrary line. But we need to find XY. Let me think about how to incorporate the parallel condition.

Lines YZ and MN are parallel. Let me find coordinates for Y and M. 

We know that line YZ connects Y and Z. Since Z is at (15, 0), we need coordinates for Y. Also, line MN connects M and N. Since N is at (6, 0), and M is on line YX.

Let me denote coordinates for Y as (p, q). Since line YX connects Y(p, q) and X(0, 0). Then, point M is somewhere on this line. The distance from X to M is 4. Let me parametrize line YX.

Parametric equations for line YX: starting at X(0,0) going towards Y(p, q). So any point on this line can be represented as t*(p, q), where t is a real number. When t=0, it's X; when t=1, it's Y. However, M could be located at different t values. The distance from X to M is 4. Let me compute the coordinates of M.

The distance from X(0,0) to M(t*p, t*q) is sqrt[(t*p)^2 + (t*q)^2] = |t| * sqrt(p² + q²). This equals 4. Therefore, |t| = 4 / sqrt(p² + q²). Let me denote sqrt(p² + q²) as the length XY, which is what we need to find. Let's call XY = d. Then, |t| = 4/d. Therefore, coordinates of M are ( (4/d)*p , (4/d)*q ). However, since M lies on line YX, which extends infinitely in both directions, t could be positive or negative. But since we don't know the direction, we can assume t positive if M is in the direction from X to Y, or negative otherwise. But since we don't have info yet, let's keep it general.

Now, line MN connects M and N(6, 0). The slope of MN is [0 - y_M]/[6 - x_M]. Where x_M = (4/d)*p and y_M = (4/d)*q. So slope of MN is (-y_M)/(6 - x_M).

Line YZ connects Y(p, q) and Z(15, 0). Its slope is [0 - q]/[15 - p] = -q/(15 - p).

Since lines YZ and MN are parallel, their slopes must be equal:

(-y_M)/(6 - x_M) = -q/(15 - p)

Simplify:

(y_M)/(6 - x_M) = q/(15 - p)

Substituting y_M = (4/d)*q and x_M = (4/d)*p:

[(4/d)*q] / [6 - (4/d)*p] = q/(15 - p)

Assuming q ≠ 0 (otherwise, Y would be on the x-axis, making line YZ horizontal, and then MN would also need to be horizontal, which may lead to contradictions if other conditions aren't met. Let me see.)

Canceling q from both sides (assuming q ≠ 0):

(4/d) / [6 - (4/d)p ] = 1/(15 - p )

Cross-multiplying:

4/d * (15 - p ) = 6 - (4/d)p

Multiply both sides by d to eliminate denominators:

4(15 - p ) = 6d - 4p

Expand left side:

60 - 4p = 6d - 4p

Add 4p to both sides:

60 = 6d → d = 10

Therefore, XY = d = 10. Which is option D.

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me verify my steps again.

Starting from equating slopes:

After substituting, I had:

(4/d) / [6 - (4/d)p ] = 1/(15 - p )

Which simplifies to:

(4/d) / [6 - (4p)/d ] = 1/(15 - p )

Cross multiply:

4/d * (15 - p ) = 6 - (4p)/d

Multiply both sides by d:

4(15 - p ) = 6d - 4p

Left side: 60 -4p

Right side: 6d -4p

Thus, 60 -4p = 6d -4p ⇒ 60 = 6d ⇒ d = 10.

Yes, that works. Therefore, XY = 10. So the answer is D.

Let me check if there were any assumptions that might have been wrong. For instance, I assumed that q ≠ 0. What if q = 0? Then line YZ would be horizontal (since Y and Z are on x-axis), so line YZ would be horizontal. Then line MN must also be horizontal. So, since N is at (6, 0), and MN is horizontal, then M must also be at the same height as N, i.e., y-coordinate 0. But M is on line YX. If Y is on x-axis (q=0), then line YX is the x-axis itself. Then M is on x-axis, so its y-coordinate is zero. Then MN is horizontal, so yes, slope zero. So that case is included in our calculation. However, in this case, if Y is on x-axis, then line YZ is horizontal, and MN is horizontal. But in this scenario, the equation still holds. For example, if Y is (p, 0), then line YX is x-axis. Then M is on x-axis, so coordinates (something, 0). Then, slope of MN is zero, slope of YZ is zero. So equality holds regardless of p. However, in this case, the earlier derivation would require dividing by q, which is zero. So, in that case, the previous steps would involve division by zero. Therefore, the assumption q ≠ 0 was necessary. However, even if q = 0, the result still holds. Because in that case, the equation reduces to 60 = 6d, leading to d = 10 regardless. So even if Y is on x-axis, the conclusion remains the same.

Hence, the answer is 10, which corresponds to option D.

Another check: Let's take specific numbers. Suppose XY = 10. Let me pick Y at (10, 0) for simplicity. Then line YX is the x-axis. Then, point M is on line YX, distance from X is 4. So M is at (4, 0). Then, line MN connects M(4,0) and N(6,0). That's a horizontal line. Line YZ connects Y(10,0) and Z(15,0), which is also horizontal. Hence, they are parallel. All conditions satisfied. In this case, XY = 10, which matches our result.

Alternatively, take Y not on x-axis. For example, let Y be (0, 10), so XY = 10 units (distance from (0,0) to (0,10)). Then line YX is vertical line x=0. Point M lies on line YX (x=0), at distance 4 from X(0,0). So M is either (0,4) or (0,-4). Let's take M=(0,4). Then line MN connects M(0,4) and N(6,0). Slope of MN is (0-4)/(6-0) = -4/6 = -2/3. Line YZ connects Y(0,10) and Z(15,0). Slope is (0-10)/(15-0) = -10/15 = -2/3. So slopes are equal, hence parallel. Perfect! So in this case, XY is 10, and the answer is correct.

Therefore, regardless of the position of Y, as long as the conditions hold, XY comes out to be 10. Hence, the correct answer is D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by interpreting the geometric constraints and applying coordinate geometry principles.

---

### Step 1: Assign Coordinates
We place **point $ X $** at the origin $(0, 0)$ for simplicity.  
Let **point $ Z $** lie along the x-axis, so we assign coordinates $ Z = (z, 0) $.  
Given that **$ XN = 6 $** and **$ NZ = 9 $**, and assuming $ N $ lies on the line segment $ XZ $, we can calculate the full length $ XZ = XN + NZ = 6 + 9 = 15 $. Thus, $ Z = (15, 0) $ and $ N = (6, 0) $.

---

### Step 2: Define Points on Lines
- **Point $ M $** lies on line $ YX $. Assume $ Y = (p, q) $, so line $ YX $ passes through $ Y $ and $ X $.
- The distance from $ X $ to $ M $ is given as $ XM = 4 $. Using the parametric form of the line $ YX $, we write:
  $$
  M = \left(\frac{4}{\sqrt{p^2 + q^2}} \cdot p, \frac{4}{\sqrt{p^2 + q^2}} \cdot q\right)
  $$
  Let $ d = \sqrt{p^2 + q^2} = XY $, so $ M = \left(\frac{4p}{d}, \frac{4q}{d}\right) $

- **Point $ N = (6, 0) $**

---

### Step 3: Use Parallelism Condition
Lines $ YZ $ and $ MN $ are **parallel**, so their slopes must be equal.

- Slope of $ YZ $: 
  $$
  m_{YZ} = \frac{0 - q}{15 - p} = \frac{-q}{15 - p}
  $$

- Slope of $ MN $: 
  $$
  m_{MN} = \frac{0 - \frac{4q}{d}}{6 - \frac{4p}{d}} = \frac{-\frac{4q}{d}}{6 - \frac{4p}{d}}
  $$

Setting the two slopes equal:
$$
\frac{-q}{15 - p} = \frac{-\frac{4q}{d}}{6 - \frac{4p}{d}}
$$

Cancel $ q $ (assume $ q \neq 0 $):
$$
\frac{1}{15 - p} = \frac{\frac{4}{d}}{6 - \frac{4p}{d}}
$$

Cross-multiply:
$$
\frac{4}{d}(15 - p) = 6 - \frac{4p}{d}
$$

Multiply both sides by $ d $ to eliminate denominator:
$$
4(15 - p) = 6d - 4p
$$

Simplify:
$$
60 - 4p = 6d - 4p
\Rightarrow 60 = 6d
\Rightarrow d = 10
$$

---

### Final Result
We have determined that $ d = XY = 10 $, so the value of $ XY $ is **10**.

---

### Final Answer: D

$$
\boxed{D}
$$
