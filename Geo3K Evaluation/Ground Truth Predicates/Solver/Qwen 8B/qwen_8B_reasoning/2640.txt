====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given information and figure out how the different elements relate. Let me start by listing out all the constraints given:

1. Measure of arc AE is 30 degrees.
2. Measure of arc BC is 4x + 50 degrees.
3. The measure of angle ADE is 3x degrees.
4. Point A lies on line CD.
5. Point E lies on line DB.
6. Points A, B, C, E lie on a circle centered at F with radius 5.0 units. So they're all on the same circle, meaning they are concyclic points.

The question asks for the value of x. The answer choices are A. 10, B. 30, C. 90, D. 120.

First, since all points A, B, C, E are on the same circle (since they lie on Circle F), that means these four points are on a circle. Also, there's some mention of tangents, but maybe that will come into play later.

Let me visualize the diagram. Since points A, B, C, E are on a circle, and lines CD and DB are involved. Also, point A is on line CD, so line CD passes through A. Similarly, point E is on line DB, so line DB passes through E. 

So perhaps we have two chords here: CD and DB. But since A is on CD and E is on DB, maybe there's some intersecting chords or something else?

Also, angle ADE is mentioned. That would be the angle at point D between points A and E. Wait, angle ADE is formed by points A-D-E. So vertex at D, with segments DA and DE. So point D is connected to A and E, forming that angle.

Since points A and E are both on the circle, but D isn't necessarily on the circle unless specified. However, point D might be outside the circle because it's connected to points A and E which are on the circle. If that's the case, then angle ADE could be related to the arcs subtended by those points.

Wait, there's a theorem about angles formed by two secants intersecting outside a circle. The measure of such an angle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

So if angle ADE is formed by two secants DA and DE, with D outside the circle, then the measure of angle ADE should be equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Let me recall the exact formula.

Yes, the measure of an angle formed by two secants intersecting outside the circle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. So:

Measure of angle = ½ (measure of larger arc - measure of smaller arc)

But first, I need to identify which arcs are being intercepted here. Since angle ADE has vertex at D, and the sides of the angle go through A and E, which are points on the circle. Therefore, the intercepted arcs would be the arcs that are opposite to the angle. Specifically, the angle intercepts arc AE and another arc... Hmm, wait. When two secants intersect outside the circle, the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are the arcs that are "cut off" by the two secants. In this case, the two secants are DA and DE. So, starting from D, going through A to the circle, and from D going through E to the circle. Therefore, the intercepted arcs would be arc AE and arc... Well, depending on the position of D relative to the circle.

Alternatively, maybe the angle intercepts arc AB or something else? Wait, perhaps I need to find the arcs that are intercepted by the two secants. Let me think again.

If D is outside the circle, and two secants DA and DE meet the circle at A and E respectively, then the angle at D is formed. Then the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are opposite the angle. So, the angle intercepts arc AE and the rest of the circle? Wait, no. Actually, when you have two secants intersecting outside, the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are "far apart". For example, if you have two points A and E on the circle, and D outside, then the angle at D intercepts arc AE and the arc that's opposite to it, which would be the arc that goes the long way around the circle. But since we have only two points, A and E, the intercepted arcs would be arc AE and the rest of the circle. But since the circle is 360 degrees, the measure of the angle is ½ (arc AE - arc opposite). Wait, actually, the formula is:

If two secants intersect at D outside the circle, then the measure of angle D is ½ ( measure of arc AE - measure of arc BF ), where BF is the arc that's intercepted by the other side? Wait, no. Maybe I need to clarify.

Actually, when two secants intersect outside the circle, the measure of the angle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are the arcs that are intercepted by the two secants. So in this case, the two intercepted arcs would be arc AE (the arc between A and E) and the arc that's opposite, which would be the arc that's not containing the angle. Wait, but there are two arcs between A and E: the minor arc AE and the major arc AE. Depending on where D is located, the angle would be half the difference of these two arcs.

Therefore, the measure of angle ADE is ½ ( measure of major arc AE - measure of minor arc AE ). Or vice versa, depending on which arc is larger. So if angle ADE is formed outside the circle, then it's half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Let me check an example. Suppose the angle is formed by two secants, then the angle equals half the difference of the intercepted arcs. So if the angle is outside, then it's half the difference between the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are the ones that are cut off by the two secants. So in this case, the intercepted arcs would be arc AE and arc... Wait, but there are only two points, A and E. Unless there are more points. Wait, but the other points B and C are also on the circle. Maybe there's more to this.

Wait, but the problem mentions arc BC as 4x + 50. So arc BC is part of the circle. Also, arc AE is given as 30 degrees. So maybe there's a relation between these arcs and angle ADE.

But first, let me focus on angle ADE. Let me assume that D is outside the circle. Because if D were inside the circle, the angle would be half the sum of the intercepted arcs, but the problem says to consider tangent segments. Wait, but the problem says "assume that any segment that appears to be tangent is tangent." So maybe some of the segments are tangent. But I don't know yet. Alternatively, maybe D is outside.

Assuming D is outside the circle, then angle ADE is formed by two secants DA and DE, intercepting arcs AE and something else? Wait, but with only points A and E on the circle, the intercepted arcs would be arc AE and the rest of the circle. Wait, but maybe there's another arc involved. Wait, but if points A and E are on the circle, then the two secants DA and DE intercept arcs that are between A and E. Wait, but without knowing where B and C are, maybe we need to consider other arcs.

Alternatively, maybe there's another arc that's involved. Let me think again. Since points A, B, C, E are all on the circle, maybe there's a quadrilateral ABC E inscribed in the circle? But not sure. Let me try to think of possible configurations.

Given that A, B, C, E are on the circle. Also, point A is on line CD, and point E is on line DB. So line CD passes through A, and line DB passes through E. So maybe points C, D, B are colinear? Wait, no. Line DB passes through E, so D is connected to B via line DB, which contains E. And line CD passes through A.

Perhaps D is the intersection point of lines CB and EA? Not sure yet. Let me try to sketch mentally.

Suppose there's a circle with points A, B, C, E on it. Lines CD and DB: line CD contains point A, and line DB contains point E. So point D is somewhere such that line CD passes through A and line DB passes through E. So D is the intersection point of lines CA and EB? Wait, not necessarily. Wait, line CD passes through A, so D is on line CA extended beyond A? Or maybe between C and A? Similarly, line DB passes through E, so D is on line BE extended beyond E? Not sure. This is getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe triangle ADE is formed with D outside the circle, connected to A and E, which are on the circle. So angle at D, which is outside. Then, according to the external angle theorem, angle ADE = ½ ( measure of arc AE - measure of arc opposite )

But what's the measure of arc AE? It's given as 30 degrees. So if that's the case, then angle ADE would be ½ ( arc AE - arc ... ? )

Wait, but if there are other arcs involved, like arc BC? Wait, arc BC is given as 4x + 50. But how does that relate to angle ADE?

Alternatively, maybe angle ADE relates to arc BC somehow? Maybe through cyclic quadrilaterals or something else.

Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between arcs AE and BC? Let me think.

But perhaps I need to look back at the arcs. Since all points A, B, C, E are on the circle, the total circumference is 360 degrees. So the sum of all arcs between consecutive points should add up to 360. But I don't know the order of the points on the circle.

Wait, maybe we can find relationships between arcs. Let me note down:

Arc AE = 30 degrees.

Arc BC = 4x + 50 degrees.

We need to find x.

Additionally, angle ADE = 3x degrees.

If angle ADE is formed by two secants intersecting outside the circle, then its measure is half the difference of the intercepted arcs.

So angle ADE = ½ ( measure of arc AE - measure of arc BC ) ?

Wait, why arc BC? How do we get that?

Wait, maybe the intercepted arcs depend on where points A, B, C, E are located on the circle. Let me imagine that the circle has points A, B, C, E arranged in some order. Suppose that moving around the circle, the points are ordered A, B, C, E, or some permutation. But without knowing their positions, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, since angle ADE intercepts arcs that are determined by the points where the secants meet the circle. So DA intersects the circle at A, and DE intersects the circle at E. Therefore, the intercepted arcs would be arc AE (between A and E) and the arc that's opposite, which could be arc BC if points B and C are positioned such that the other arc is BC. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the intercepted arcs are arc AB and arc EC? Not sure. Without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging. However, maybe there's another approach.

Another thought: since points A, B, C, E are on the circle, and lines CD and DB pass through A and E respectively, maybe there are intersecting chords or something else. For instance, if lines CD and BE intersect at D, then D is the intersection point of lines CD and BE. So, using power of a point, maybe?

Power of a point D with respect to the circle would state that DA * DC = DB * DE.

But we don't know the lengths, though. However, maybe we can use angles. Wait, but angle ADE is given. Maybe combining power of a point with the angle?

Alternatively, considering triangle ADE, with angle at D being 3x. If I can express this angle in terms of arcs, then set up an equation.

Earlier idea: If angle ADE is formed by two secants intersecting outside the circle, then angle ADE = ½ ( measure of arc AE - measure of arc BC ). But why arc BC?

Wait, suppose that the two secants DA and DE intercept arcs AE and BC. But why would arc BC be involved? Perhaps if points B and C are positioned such that when you draw DA and DE, the other intercepted arc is BC. But I need to think of the general case.

Alternatively, maybe there are two arcs intercepted by the secants. For example, when you have two secants from D to A and D to E, then the angle at D intercepts arc AE and arc BC. Wait, but how does that happen? Unless points A and E are connected to points B and C in some way.

Alternatively, maybe the angle ADE intercepts arc AB and arc CE or something. This seems too vague without a diagram.

Wait, let's take a different approach. Let's consider that angle ADE is 3x degrees. From the external angle theorem, if D is outside the circle, then angle ADE = ½ ( measure of arc AE - measure of arc BC ). Assuming that arc BC is the arc that's opposite to arc AE. But why arc BC?

Alternatively, perhaps arc AE and arc BC are the two intercepted arcs. Wait, but usually, the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are "cut" by the two secants. So if DA and DE are secants, then the intercepted arcs are AE and the arc that's opposite, which depends on where D is.

Alternatively, since points A and E are on the circle, and D is outside, then the angle at D is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs would be the arcs that are intercepted by the two secants. So, from point D, drawing secant DA to A and secant DE to E. Thus, the intercepted arcs would be arc AE (from A to E along the shorter path) and the arc that goes the other way around the circle from A to E, passing through the other points. But since there are points B and C on the circle, maybe that arc includes arc BC?

For example, suppose the circle has points A, B, C, E placed in order around the circle. So going from A to B to C to E, then back to A. Then, the arc from A to E that doesn't include B and C would be arc AE directly, while the other arc would go through B and C, making arc BC part of that longer arc.

In this case, the angle at D would be ½ ( measure of arc ABE - measure of arc AE ). Wait, but arc ABE would include arc AB and arc BC and arc CE. But we only have arc BC given as 4x + 50. Hmm, but we don't know the measures of arc AB or arc CE.

Alternatively, maybe the intercepted arcs are arc AE and arc BC. If angle ADE intercepts arc AE and arc BC, then angle ADE would be ½ ( arc AE - arc BC ). But that would require that arc AE and arc BC are the intercepted arcs. But how?

Alternatively, maybe there's a specific configuration where points A, B, C, E are arranged such that when you connect D to A and E, the angle ADE intercepts arcs AE and BC. For instance, if points B and C are positioned such that the secants DA and DE create an angle whose intercepted arcs are AE and BC. But without knowing the exact arrangement, this is guesswork.

However, let's proceed with the assumption that angle ADE = ½ ( measure of arc AE - measure of arc BC ). Given that, we can write:

3x = ½ ( arc AE - arc BC )

From the problem, arc AE is 30°, and arc BC is 4x + 50°. Plugging these in:

3x = ½ (30 - (4x + 50))  
Multiply both sides by 2:

6x = 30 - 4x - 50  
6x + 4x = -20  
10x = -20  
x = -2  

That gives x negative, which doesn't make sense since arc measures and angles can't be negative. So my assumption must be wrong.

Hmm. Maybe the formula is reversed? What if it's ½ ( arc BC - arc AE ) instead?

Then:

3x = ½ ( (4x + 50) - 30 )  
3x = ½ (4x + 20)  
Multiply both sides by 2:

6x = 4x + 20  
6x - 4x = 20  
2x = 20  
x = 10  

Which is option A. But let me verify if this makes sense.

So assuming that angle ADE is ½ ( arc BC - arc AE ), leading to x=10. Let's check if this is plausible.

But why would angle ADE be half the difference of arc BC and arc AE? That would imply that arc BC is larger than arc AE, which would be true if x=10, then arc BC would be 4(10)+50 = 90 degrees, and arc AE is 30 degrees. So 90-30=60, divided by 2 is 30, which matches angle ADE = 3x = 3*10=30. So that works!

But why is the angle ADE equal to half the difference of arc BC and arc AE? That suggests that the intercepted arcs are arc BC and arc AE. How does that happen?

This requires that the two secants DA and DE intercept arcs BC and AE. But how?

Maybe the angle at D intercepts arc BC and arc AE. To do that, the secants DA and DE would need to intercept arcs that are not directly between A and E. Wait, but normally, when you have two secants from D to A and D to E, they intercept arc AE and the opposite arc. However, if points B and C are positioned such that the opposite arc includes arc BC, then maybe arc BC is part of the intercepted arc.

Alternatively, maybe the angle ADE is formed by intersecting secants that intercept arcs AE and BC. But I'm not sure. However, mathematically, solving with that assumption gives us a valid answer (x=10) which is one of the options. Let me see if there's another way to arrive at this conclusion.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a cyclic quadrilateral involved. For instance, if points A, B, C, E are on the circle, then maybe quadrilateral ABCE is cyclic. However, we already knew that since they are on the same circle. So maybe using properties of cyclic quadrilaterals.

But angle ADE is not necessarily part of the cyclic quadrilateral. Alternatively, maybe triangle ADE relates to some other triangles.

Alternatively, consider that since points A and E are on the circle, and D is outside, then the power of point D with respect to the circle is DA * DC = DE * DB. But without knowing the lengths, this might not help directly. However, if we had more info about the lengths, maybe we could combine with angle relations.

But since we don't have lengths, maybe this approach isn't helpful.

Another possibility: Since points A, B, C, E are on the circle, maybe there are inscribed angles related to them. For example, angle ADE could be related to some inscribed angle. Wait, but D is outside the circle.

Alternatively, if we consider that angle ADE is formed by two secants, and the arcs intercepted are arc AE and arc BC. Why arc BC?

Perhaps if points A, B, C, E are arranged such that when you draw DA and DE, the arcs intercepted are AE and BC. For example, if the circle has points A and E, and points B and C are located such that the arc from A to E that's opposite to the angle is arc BC. But this is still unclear without a diagram.

However, given that assuming angle ADE = ½(arc BC - arc AE) leads us to x=10, which is one of the options, and checking the calculation shows consistency, maybe that's the right approach. Let me verify once again.

Given that angle ADE is formed by two secants DA and DE, so the measure is ½ ( larger arc - smaller arc ). Here, if arc BC is the larger arc and arc AE is the smaller one, then angle ADE would be ½ ( arc BC - arc AE ).

With arc AE = 30°, arc BC = 4x + 50°, then:

angle ADE = ½ ( (4x + 50) - 30 ) = ½ (4x + 20) = 2x + 10.

But angle ADE is given as 3x. So setting 2x + 10 = 3x → x = 10. Which matches our previous calculation.

Thus, x = 10, which corresponds to option A.

But why is the angle ADE equal to ½ ( arc BC - arc AE )? Let me think again. The intercepted arcs for an external angle are the arcs that are intercepted by the two secants. Normally, if two secants intersect at D outside the circle, they intercept two arcs: one between the two points where the secants meet the circle (arc AE), and the other arc that goes the long way around the circle. However, if there are other points on the circle, like B and C, then the long arc might include arc BC. For example, if the circle is labeled such that moving from A to E along the long arc passes through B and C, then the long arc would be arc ABE or something similar, which might include arc BC. Hence, the difference between the long arc and the short arc (arc AE) would involve arc BC.

But since arc BC is given as 4x + 50, which is likely a portion of the long arc. However, without knowing the entire measure of the long arc, it's difficult to say. But in this case, the formula worked out, giving us x=10. And since this leads to a consistent answer, and x=10 is an option, I think this is the intended solution.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. 10.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration described in the problem and applying key theorems from circle geometry, particularly focusing on **angles formed by two secants intersecting outside a circle**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Given Information

We are told:

- Arc $ \overset{\frown}{AE} = 30^\circ $
- Arc $ \overset{\frown}{BC} = 4x + 50^\circ $
- Angle $ \angle ADE = 3x $
- Points $ A, B, C, E $ lie on the same circle (i.e., they are **concyclic**) 
- $ D $ lies outside the circle, and lines $ CD $ and $ DB $ pass through points $ A $ and $ E $, respectively

This implies that angle $ \angle ADE $ is formed by two secants $ DA $ and $ DE $, intersecting at point $ D $ **outside the circle**.

---

### Step 2: Use the External Angle Theorem

According to the **External Angle Theorem**, the measure of an angle formed by two secants intersecting outside a circle is:

$$
\text{Angle} = \frac{1}{2} (\text{Measure of Larger Intercepted Arc} - \text{Measure of Smaller Intercepted Arc})
$$

Here, the angle $ \angle ADE $ is formed by secants $ DA $ and $ DE $, intercepting arcs $ \overset{\frown}{AE} $ and another arc—likely involving points $ B $ and $ C $. We assume the arc intercepted by the angle is the **larger arc**, and the arc that is **not** intercepted is the smaller arc. Based on the given data, the arcs involved are:

- Arc $ \overset{\frown}{AE} = 30^\circ $
- Arc $ \overset{\frown}{BC} = 4x + 50^\circ $

These arcs are assumed to be the **intercepted arcs** of the angle. Since arc $ \overset{\frown}{BC} $ is presumably the **larger arc**, and arc $ \overset{\frown}{AE} $ is the **smaller arc**, we apply the formula:

$$
\angle ADE = \frac{1}{2} \left( \text{Arc } \overset{\frown}{BC} - \text{Arc } \overset{\frown}{AE} \right)
$$

Substituting the known values:

$$
3x = \frac{1}{2} \left( (4x + 50) - 30 \right)
$$

$$
3x = \frac{1}{2}(4x + 20)
$$

$$
6x = 4x + 20
$$

$$
2x = 20 \Rightarrow x = 10
$$

---

### Step 3: Final Check and Interpretation

- Substituting $ x = 10 $:
  - Arc $ \overset{\frown}{AE} = 30^\circ $
  - Arc $ \overset{\frown}{BC} = 4(10) + 50 = 90^\circ $
  - Then,
    $$
    \angle ADE = \frac{1}{2}(90 - 30) = 30^\circ
    $$
  - And,
    $$
    3x = 3(10) = 30^\circ
    $$

Both expressions agree, confirming the correctness of the solution.
