MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points R, S, and T. The problem says that the length of line RS is 4√3, and the length of line TS is 10√3. Also, the lines SR and ST are perpendicular. We need to find the measure of angle T, which I assume is angle at point T between points S, T, and maybe another point? Wait, hold on. Let me clarify the question again.

The question asks for the measure of ∠T. Since there are three points mentioned—R, S, T—it's likely referring to the angle at point T formed by points S, T, and another point. But wait, since only R, S, T are mentioned, perhaps it's triangle RST? If that's the case, then ∠T would be the angle at vertex T of triangle RST. 

Let me sketch this mentally. Points S, R, and T. Given that lines SR and ST are perpendicular. So, point S is connected to both R and T, forming two sides of a right angle at S. Therefore, triangle RST has a right angle at S. Because the lines SR and ST are perpendicular. That makes sense. So triangle RST is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at S. Then, the legs are SR and ST, with lengths 4√3 and 10√3 respectively. Wait, but the hypotenuse would be RT. However, the question is asking for angle T. In triangle RST, angle T is one of the non-right angles.

So, in a right-angled triangle, the angles can be found using trigonometric ratios. Let me recall. Since it's a right triangle at S, angle T is opposite side SR (which is 4√3) and adjacent to side ST (which is 10√3). Wait, no. Let me think again. In triangle RST, with right angle at S. So:

- Side opposite angle T: that would be side SR. Because angle T is at vertex T, so the side opposite is SR.

Wait, maybe I should label the triangle properly. Let me consider triangle RST with right angle at S. So vertices are S, R, T. The right angle is at S, meaning that segments SR and ST form the legs, and RT is the hypotenuse.

Therefore, angle at T is angle between hypotenuse RT and leg ST. To find angle T, we can use trigonometry. Specifically, tangent of angle T equals opposite over adjacent. In this case, opposite side to angle T is SR, and adjacent is ST. Wait, let me confirm:

In triangle RST, angle at T. Opposite side to angle T is SR. Adjacent side is ST. Yes. So tan(angle T) = opposite / adjacent = SR / ST.

Given that SR is 4√3 and ST is 10√3. So tan(angle T) = (4√3)/(10√3). Simplify that: the √3 cancels out, giving 4/10 = 2/5. So tan(theta) = 2/5. Therefore, theta is arctangent of 2/5. Let me compute that value.

Calculating arctan(2/5). Let me convert that into degrees. Well, 2 divided by 5 is 0.4. So arctan(0.4). Let me recall that arctan(0.4)... Hmm. I know that arctan(1) is 45°, arctan(0.5) is approximately 26.565°, and arctan(0.4) would be less than that. Let me check using calculator steps.

Alternatively, since I don't have a calculator here, but I can approximate. Alternatively, maybe I can remember some values. For instance, tan(21.8°) is approximately 0.4? Let me think. Let me recall that tan(21.8°) ≈ 0.4. Wait, because if you take 21.8 degrees, tan(21.8) is roughly 0.4?

Wait, let me verify. Let me recall that tan(21.8°):

Well, 21.8 degrees is close to 21.8, which might correspond to the answer option A, which is 21.8. Let me check if tan(21.8) ≈ 0.4.

Alternatively, let me calculate using known values. Let me think about the exact value. Suppose tan(theta) = 2/5 = 0.4. Let me compute theta in degrees.

Using a calculator (pretending I'm calculating), arctan(0.4) is approximately... Let me recall that tan(21.8°) ≈ 0.4. For example, if I remember that tan(20°) is approx 0.3640, tan(22°) is approx 0.4040. So 0.4 is between 20° and 22°, closer to 22°. Let me do linear approximation.

Between 20° and 22°, tan increases from ~0.3640 to ~0.4040. The difference between these is 0.4040 - 0.3640 = 0.04 over 2 degrees. Our target is 0.4, which is 0.4 - 0.3640 = 0.036 above tan(20°). So fraction is 0.036 / 0.04 = 0.9. Therefore, approximate angle is 20° + 0.9*(2°) = 20° + 1.8° = 21.8°. Hence, arctan(0.4) ≈ 21.8°, which matches option A.

But wait, let me check if my assumption was correct. Is angle T equal to arctan(opposite/adjacent)? Let me make sure I didn't mix up the sides.

In triangle RST, right-angled at S. So angle T is at vertex T. So, the sides relative to angle T are:

Opposite side: SR (since angle T is at T; the side opposite is SR).

Adjacent side: ST (the other leg).

Hypotenuse: RT.

Yes, so tan(angle T) = opposite / adjacent = SR / ST = (4√3) / (10√3) = 4/10 = 2/5, as before. So yes, angle T is arctan(2/5) ≈ 21.8°, which would be option A. But wait, let me check if there's any mistake here.

Wait, another way: perhaps I got the ratio reversed? Let me double-check. In a right triangle, for angle T, the opposite side is the side opposite angle T, which is SR. The adjacent side is ST. So yes, tan(theta) = opposite / adjacent = SR / ST = 4√3 / 10√3 = 4/10 = 2/5. Correct. So arctan(2/5) ≈ 21.8 degrees. Therefore, answer is A.

But wait, looking back at the answer choices, option A is 21.8, option B is 23.6, etc. So according to my calculation, answer is A. But let me cross-validate. Maybe I made an error in identifying which angle is which.

Alternatively, maybe angle T refers to something else? Wait, could there be confusion with the notation? Let me re-express the problem.

Points R, S, T. Lines SR and ST are perpendicular. So S is the common vertex. So, imagine point S with two lines going out: one to R and one to T, and those two lines are perpendicular. So triangle RST is right-angled at S. Therefore, the triangle has legs SR and ST, and hypotenuse RT.

Then, angle T is the angle at point T. Which is one of the acute angles in the right triangle. As discussed earlier, tan(angle T) = opposite / adjacent = SR / ST = 4√3 / 10√3 = 2/5. So arctan(2/5) ≈ 21.8 degrees. Thus, answer is A.

But let me check if there's an alternative approach. For example, using Pythagoras to find the third side, then using sine or cosine. Let's see. Hypotenuse RT would be sqrt( (4√3)^2 + (10√3)^2 ) = sqrt( 16*3 + 100*3 ) = sqrt( (16+100)*3 ) = sqrt(116 * 3) = sqrt(348). Let me compute that. 348 factors into 4*87, so sqrt(4*87)=2*sqrt(87). Not sure if helpful.

But if I want to use sine or cosine for angle T. For example, sin(angle T) = opposite / hypotenuse = SR / RT. Let's compute that. SR is 4√3, RT is sqrt( (4√3)^2 + (10√3)^2 ). As above, that's sqrt( 16*3 + 100*3 ) = sqrt( 116*3 ) = sqrt(348). So sin(theta) = 4√3 / sqrt(348). Let me simplify that. Note that sqrt(348) can be simplified. Let me factor 348. Divided by 4, gives 87. So sqrt(348) = sqrt(4*87) = 2*sqrt(87). Therefore, sin(theta) = 4√3 / (2√87) )= 2√3 / √87. Rationalizing denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by √87:

sin(theta) = 2√3 * √87 / 87 = 2√(261)/87. Wait, but maybe simplifying further. Let me note that 87 = 3*29. Therefore, √87 = √(3*29). So √3 / √87 = 1 / √29. Therefore, sin(theta) = 2 / √29. Which is approximately 2 / 5.385 ≈ 0.371. Then arcsin(0.371) is approximately... Let me see. Arcsin(0.371). Again, knowing that sin(21.8°) ≈ 0.371? Let me check.

If theta ≈ 21.8°, then sin(theta) ≈ 0.371. Let me check with known values. For example, sin(20°) ≈ 0.3420, sin(22°) ≈ 0.3746. So 0.371 is between 20° and 22°, closer to 22°. Let me compute the exact value. Let me suppose that sin(theta) = 2/sqrt(29). Let me compute 2/sqrt(29):

sqrt(29) ≈ 5.385, so 2 / 5.385 ≈ 0.371. So theta ≈ arcsin(0.371). Using linear approximation between 20° and 22°:

At 20°, sin(20°) ≈ 0.3420

At 22°, sin(22°) ≈ 0.3746

Difference between 20° and 22° is 2°, and sin increases by approx 0.3746 - 0.3420 = 0.0326 per degree. Our value is 0.371, which is 0.371 - 0.3420 = 0.029 above sin(20°). So fraction is 0.029 / 0.0326 ≈ 0.89. Therefore, angle ≈ 20° + 0.89*2° ≈ 20° + 1.78° ≈ 21.78°, which rounds to 21.8°, matching our previous result. So that confirms that angle T is approximately 21.8°, so answer A.

But just to ensure that there isn't a misunderstanding in the problem setup. Another possibility: Could the angle T refer to something else? Like, if there were more points or different configuration? But based on the given information, the only possible triangle is RST with right angle at S. Therefore, angle T is definitely one of the acute angles in that triangle, and our calculation holds.

Another check: if we compute cos(theta) for angle T. Cos(theta) = adjacent / hypotenuse = ST / RT. ST is 10√3, RT is sqrt( (4√3)^2 + (10√3)^2 ) = sqrt( 16*3 + 100*3 ) = sqrt( 116*3 ). So same as before, sqrt(348). So cos(theta) = 10√3 / sqrt(348). Simplify:

Same as before, sqrt(348) = 2*sqrt(87). So cos(theta) = 10√3 / (2√87) = 5√3 / √87. Multiply numerator and denominator by √87: 5√(3*87)/87. Wait, but 3*87=261. Alternatively, simplifying √3 / √87 = 1 / √29. So cos(theta) = 5 / √29 ≈ 5 / 5.385 ≈ 0.928. Therefore, theta ≈ arccos(0.928). What's arccos(0.928)?

Again, knowing that cos(21.8°) ≈ ? Let me check. For example, cos(21.8°): if theta is 21.8°, then cos(theta) ≈ 0.928. Let me check with calculator-like thinking. For example, cos(20°) ≈ 0.9397, cos(22°) ≈ 0.9272. Oh! So cos(22°) ≈ 0.9272, which is very close to 0.928. So if our value is 0.928, that would be slightly less than 22°, say around 21.8°, which aligns with our prior conclusion. Hence, confirming that angle T is approximately 21.8°, so answer A.

Thus, after multiple approaches and checks, the measure of angle T is approximately 21.8 degrees, corresponding to option A.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $ \angle T $, we begin by analyzing the given geometric constraints:

- **Line Segment Lengths**:
  - $ RS = 4\sqrt{3} $
  - $ ST = 10\sqrt{3} $

- **Angle Relationship**: 
  - $ \angle RST = 90^\circ $, i.e., the lines $ SR $ and $ ST $ are perpendicular.

From this, we conclude that triangle $ RST $ is a **right triangle**, right-angled at $ S $. This means that the sides $ SR $ and $ ST $ are the **legs**, and the segment $ RT $ is the **hypotenuse**.

We are asked to find the measure of $ \angle T $, which is one of the **acute angles** in triangle $ RST $, specifically the angle at vertex $ T $. In such a triangle, we can apply **trigonometric ratios** to determine the angle.

---

### Step 1: Use Tangent Ratio
In a right triangle, the tangent of an angle is defined as the ratio of the **length of the side opposite the angle** to the **length of the side adjacent to the angle**.

For $ \angle T $:
- The side **opposite** $ \angle T $ is $ SR = 4\sqrt{3} $
- The side **adjacent** to $ \angle T $ is $ ST = 10\sqrt{3} $

$$
\tan(\angle T) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{SR}{ST} = \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{10\sqrt{3}} = \frac{4}{10} = \frac{2}{5}
$$

---

### Step 2: Compute the Angle
Now, we compute:

$$
\angle T = \arctan\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)
$$

Using a calculator or known approximations:

$$
\arctan(0.4) \approx 21.8^\circ
$$

This corresponds directly to **Option A**.

---

### Final Verification
As a secondary confirmation, we can also use the sine or cosine functions:

- $ \sin(\angle T) = \frac{SR}{RT} $
- $ \cos(\angle T) = \frac{ST}{RT} $

We can compute the hypotenuse $ RT $ using the Pythagorean theorem:

$$
RT = \sqrt{(4\sqrt{3})^2 + (10\sqrt{3})^2} = \sqrt{16 \cdot 3 + 100 \cdot 3} = \sqrt{348}
$$

$$
\sin(\angle T) = \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{348}}, \quad \cos(\angle T) = \frac{10\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{348}}
$$

Both lead to consistent results when computing inverse trigonometric functions, reaffirming that $ \angle T \approx 21.8^\circ $.

---

### Conclusion
After applying trigonometry and verifying through multiple methods, the measure of $ \angle T $ is approximately:

$$
\boxed{21.8^\circ}
$$
