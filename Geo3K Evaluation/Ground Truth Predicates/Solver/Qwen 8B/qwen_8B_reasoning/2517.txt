====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, C, D, and F. The first thing mentioned is that point B lies on line AC. Wait, but then there's something about vectors BA and BC being opposite rays. Hmm, opposite rays... That means they start at the same point and go in opposite directions. So if BA and BC are opposite rays, then point B is between A and C? Because opposite rays would form a straight line through B. So that makes sense with the first constraint that B lies on line AC. So, points A, B, C are colinear with B between them. 

Now, BD bisects angle ABF. So angle ABF is being bisected by BD. We need to find the measure of angle DBF. Also, we're given two expressions for angles: m∠FBC = 2x + 25 and m∠ABF = 10x - 1. Let me visualize this. Let me sketch a rough diagram in my mind. Point B is on line AC. Then there's another point F such that when you look at angle ABF, which is formed by BA and BF. And BD is the bisector of that angle. Also, since BA and BC are opposite rays, BC is going in the direction opposite to BA. So, maybe F is somewhere off the line AC?

Wait, so angle ABF. Since BA is part of the line AC (since B is on AC), and BC is the opposite ray of BA, meaning that BC goes in the opposite direction from BA. So, if I imagine BA pointing towards A, then BC points away from A, along the line AC extended beyond B. Now, angle ABF is formed by BA and BF. So point F is somewhere such that BF forms some angle with BA. Then BD bisects that angle ABF into two equal parts. So angle ABD equals angle DBF. But wait, the question asks for m∠DBF. So if BD bisects ∠ABF, then ∠ABF is split into two equal angles, each of which is half of ∠ABF. Therefore, ∠DBF would be half of ∠ABF. Wait, but hold on, maybe there's more to it because of the other information about ∠FBC?

Let me think again. Since BA and BC are opposite rays, then BC is a straight line extending from B in the opposite direction of BA. So, if I consider angle ABC, but here we have angle ABF. Maybe F is positioned such that BF is forming an angle with BA, and BC is another line. Wait, perhaps triangle BFC or something else. Let me try to break down the given angles.

We know that m∠FBC = 2x + 25. So that's the angle at point B between points F and C. Also, m∠ABF = 10x - 1. Since BA and BC are opposite rays, the entire angle around point B from BA to BC would be a straight line, so 180 degrees. However, angle ABF is adjacent to angle FBC? Wait, maybe. Let me see.

If we consider the line AC passing through B, with BA and BC as opposite rays. Then, point F is somewhere such that BF creates an angle with BA (which is part of BA) and with BC. Wait, but angle FBC is given. So angle FBC is the angle between FB and BC. So if we imagine point F somewhere, then BF connects to F, creating angle FBC with BC. Also, angle ABF is between BA and BF. Since BA and BC are opposite rays, the sum of angles ABF and FBC should be equal to the straight angle, which is 180 degrees. Is that right? Because if you have BA and BC as opposite rays, then any angle between BA and BF plus the angle between BF and BC would make up the straight line. So:

m∠ABF + m∠FBC = 180°

So substituting the given expressions:

(10x - 1) + (2x + 25) = 180

Combine like terms:

10x + 2x = 12x

-1 + 25 = 24

So:

12x + 24 = 180

Subtract 24 from both sides:

12x = 156

Divide by 12:

x = 13

Okay, so x is 13. Now, we can plug back into the expressions to find the measures of those angles.

First, m∠ABF = 10x - 1 = 10*13 - 1 = 130 - 1 = 129 degrees.

Then, m∠FBC = 2x + 25 = 2*13 + 25 = 26 + 25 = 51 degrees.

Check that these add up to 180: 129 + 51 = 180. Yes, that works.

Now, the question is asking for m∠DBF. Since BD bisects angle ABF, then angle ABF is split into two equal angles by BD. Therefore, each of those angles would be half of 129 degrees. Wait, but BD is the bisector. So angle ABD equals angle DBF. Therefore, m∠DBF = (1/2)m∠ABF = 129 / 2 = 64.5 degrees. 

Looking at the answer choices, option D is 64.5. So that would be the answer. Let me check again if I made any mistake here.

Wait, but let me confirm once more. The key idea is that BD bisects angle ABF. Therefore, angle ABF is divided into two equal parts. So yes, angle ABD and angle DBF are equal. Therefore, angle DBF is half of angle ABF, which is 129/2 = 64.5. Which matches answer D. 

But let me just check if there's another way this could be interpreted. For example, could there be a case where angle FBC relates to angle DBF somehow? Let me think again. Suppose BD is the bisector of angle ABF, so it splits angle ABF into two equal parts. So regardless of the position of F, as long as BD bisects that angle, then angle DBF is half of angle ABF. But angle FBC is given. But since we already used the fact that angles ABF and FBC add up to 180, leading us to find x=13, and then using that to compute angle ABF. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another relationship involving angle FBC and BD? For instance, if BD is the bisector, could there be some relation between angle FBC and angle DBF? Let me think. Let me draw a mental picture again. Points A-B-C colinear, with BA and BC opposite rays. Then, point F is somewhere such that BF makes an angle with BA (angle ABF) and with BC (angle FBC). BD is the bisector of angle ABF. So BD divides angle ABF into two equal parts. So, starting from BA, going through BD to BF. Therefore, angle between BA and BD is equal to angle between BD and BF. Thus, angle DBF is half of ABF. Therefore, 129/2 = 64.5. 

Therefore, answer D. 

But let me check if there's any possible error in assuming that angle ABF and angle FBC are supplementary. Because BA and BC are opposite rays, so they form a straight line. So if you have a point F, then BF is some ray from B, making angle ABF with BA, and angle FBC with BC. Therefore, those two angles should add up to 180 degrees. Hence, that equation is valid. 

Yes, so solving gives x=13, leading to angle ABF=129 degrees. Then BD bisects that angle, so DBF is half of that. Therefore, 64.5, which is answer D. So I think that's correct. 

Another check: suppose x was different. Let me say, if x was 10, then angle ABF would be 99, angle FBC would be 45, adding to 144, which isn't 180. But our calculation gave x=13, which gives 129+51=180. Correct. So that seems solid. 

Hence, the answer should be D, 64.5.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration based on the given conditions:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**

- **Points A, B, and C** lie on a straight line with **point B between A and C**, i.e., $ \vec{BA} $ and $ \vec{BC} $ are **opposite rays**.
- **Ray BD** bisects $ \angle ABF $, implying that:
  $$
  \angle ABD = \angle DBF
  $$

This setup tells us that $ \angle ABF $ is split into two equal parts by the bisector $ \vec{BD} $. Our goal is to determine the measure of $ \angle DBF $.

---

### **Step 2: Use Given Angle Expressions**

We are told:

- $ m\angle FBC = 2x + 25 $
- $ m\angle ABF = 10x - 1 $

Since $ \vec{BA} $ and $ \vec{BC} $ are opposite rays, the total angle between them is a **straight angle** of $ 180^\circ $. This implies:
$$
m\angle ABF + m\angle FBC = 180^\circ
$$

Substituting the given expressions:
$$
(10x - 1) + (2x + 25) = 180
$$

---

### **Step 3: Solve for $ x $**

$$
12x + 24 = 180 \\
12x = 156 \\
x = 13
$$

---

### **Step 4: Compute $ m\angle ABF $**

$$
m\angle ABF = 10x - 1 = 10(13) - 1 = 130 - 1 = 129^\circ
$$

---

### **Step 5: Find $ m\angle DBF $**

Since $ \vec{BD} $ **bisects** $ \angle ABF $, it divides it into two equal parts:
$$
m\angle DBF = \frac{1}{2} m\angle ABF = \frac{1}{2}(129) = 64.5^\circ
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

The measure of $ \angle DBF $ is **64.5°**, which corresponds to **option D**.

---

**Final Answer: D**
