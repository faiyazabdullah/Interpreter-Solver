MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given information and figure out how the different elements relate. Let me start by listing out all the given constraints:

1. Angle at R between points T and S has measure 2x. So ∠TRS = 2x.
2. Angle at S between points R and T has measure x. So ∠TSR = x.
3. Point B lies on line RT. Wait, no—the wording says "PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(R, T))", so point B is on the line segment RT? Or just somewhere along the line RT?
4. Points R, T, and S lie on a circle centered at B with radius 3.0. So B is the center of a circle passing through R, T, and S. Therefore, BR = BT = BS = 3.0 units.

Wait, hold on. If B is the center of the circle, then R, T, S are all on the circumference of the circle with center B. That means BR = BT = BS = radius, which is 3.0. But also, since B is on line RT (from constraint 3), that makes sense because if B is the center, then RT would be a chord of the circle. But since B is on RT, that suggests that RT is a diameter? Because the center lies on the line connecting two points on the circle. Wait, but RT could be a chord, but if B is the midpoint of RT, then it's a diameter. However, unless specified otherwise, maybe RT isn't necessarily a diameter. Hmm.

But wait, let me think again. Since B is the center of the circle passing through R, T, and S, then BR = BT = BS = radius. Also, since B lies on line RT, then line RT passes through the center of the circle. Therefore, RT is a chord of the circle that passes through the center, meaning RT is a diameter. Because the only way for a line through the center intersecting the circle at two points is if it's a diameter. Therefore, RT is a diameter of the circle. Hence, the length of RT is twice the radius, so 2*3=6 units. So RT = 6 units. 

So points R and T are endpoints of a diameter of the circle centered at B. Then point S is another point on the same circle. So triangle RST is inscribed in the circle with RT as diameter. Wait, but if RT is a diameter, then angle at S subtended by RT would be a right angle. Because of Thales' theorem. So ∠RS T would be 90 degrees. Wait, but according to the given angles, ∠TSR is x. So if ∠TSR is x, then perhaps there's some relation here. Wait, but let me check again.

Wait, the angles mentioned are ∠TRS = 2x and ∠TSR = x. Let me draw triangle RST. Let me consider triangle RST with points R, S, T. Given that RT is a diameter. So in triangle RST, angle at S (∠TSR) is x, angle at R (∠TRS) is 2x. Then we can find the third angle at T. The sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, so ∠RTS = 180° - 2x - x = 180° - 3x. But also, since RT is a diameter, ∠RS T should be a right angle. Wait, no—Thales' theorem states that if you have a triangle inscribed in a circle where one side is the diameter, then the angle opposite that diameter is a right angle. So in this case, the angle opposite RT would be ∠S. So ∠S = 90°, which would mean that x = 90°, but that contradicts the answer choices given. Wait, but the answer choices are up to 60. So something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe my assumption that RT is a diameter is incorrect. Let me re-examine that. The problem states that B is the center of the circle passing through R, T, and S. Therefore, BR = BT = BS = radius. And B lies on line RT. So line RT contains the center B. So RT is a line that passes through the center, making it a diameter? Not necessarily. For example, if B is the midpoint of RT, then yes, RT is a diameter. But if B is not the midpoint, then RT is just a chord passing through the center, which would still make it a diameter. Wait, because any chord passing through the center is a diameter. Therefore, RT is a diameter regardless. Therefore, ∠RS T should be 90°, but according to the problem, ∠TSR = x. Therefore, x should be 90°, but none of the answer choices is 90. So this suggests that there's a mistake in my reasoning.

Alternatively, maybe I misapplied Thales' theorem. Let me confirm: Thales' theorem states that if A, B, and C are points on a circle where AB is a diameter, then angle ACB is a right angle. In our case, if RT is a diameter, then angle at S (∠RST) should be a right angle. Wait, but the problem says ∠TSR = x. Which is the same as ∠RST. So according to this, x should equal 90°, but the answer choices don't include 90. Therefore, there must be an error in my assumptions.

Let me go back. Maybe the problem is not saying that B is the center of the circle passing through R, T, S. Wait, the constraints say:

- PointLiesOnCircle(R, Circle(B, radius_3_0)): So R lies on the circle with center B and radius 3.0. Similarly for T and S. Therefore, B is the center, and R, T, S are points on the circumference. Thus, BR = BT = BS = 3.0. Also, B lies on line RT. So line RT passes through B, the center. Therefore, RT is a chord passing through the center, hence a diameter. Therefore, RT is a diameter. Therefore, length RT = 2 * radius = 6. So RT = 6 units.

Therefore, triangle RST has RT as a diameter. Then, by Thales' theorem, ∠S = 90°, which is ∠RST = 90°. But according to the problem, ∠RST = x. Therefore, x = 90°, but answer choices are 30, 40, 50, 60. So this seems contradictory. Therefore, my previous conclusion must be wrong. Where is the mistake?

Wait, maybe the angles are not referring to the same angle. Let me clarify the notation. The angle MeasureOf(Angle(R, T, S)) refers to the angle at point T between points R and S. Wait, angle notation: Angle(R, T, S) is the angle at point T between segments TR and TS. So that's ∠RTS. Whereas Angle(S, R, T) is the angle at point R between segments SR and TR. So that's ∠SRT. Wait, the original problem says:

MeasureOf(Angle(R, T, S)) = 2x → This is ∠RTS = 2x.

MeasureOf(Angle(S, R, T)) = x → This is ∠SRT = x.

So in triangle RST, the angles are:

At R: ∠SRT = x,

At T: ∠RTS = 2x,

And at S: ∠RST = ?

Sum of angles: x + 2x + ∠RST = 180° ⇒ ∠RST = 180° - 3x.

But earlier, I thought that ∠RST would be 90°, but that was based on assuming that RT is a diameter. However, if RT is a diameter, then ∠RST should be a right angle. Wait, but ∠RST is at point S, between RS and ST. So according to Thales' theorem, if RT is a diameter, then ∠RST is a right angle. Therefore, ∠RST = 90°, so 180° - 3x = 90° ⇒ 3x = 90° ⇒ x = 30°. Which matches option A. But why did I get confused before?

Ah! Earlier, I incorrectly associated ∠TSR with being the right angle, but actually, ∠RST is the angle at S, which is the right angle. So ∠RST = 90°, leading to x = 30°. Therefore, answer A. So that would make sense. Let me verify again.

Given that RT is a diameter, so ∠RST is 90°, which equals 180° - 3x. Solving:

180 - 3x = 90 ⇒ 3x = 90 ⇒ x = 30. So answer is A. But let me double-check all steps.

First, confirming that RT is a diameter. Since B is the center, and points R and T are on the circle, and B lies on line RT. Therefore, RT is a chord passing through the center, so it's a diameter. Therefore, length RT = 2r = 6.

Then, triangle RST has RT as its hypotenuse (since it's a diameter). Therefore, by Thales' theorem, ∠RST is 90°. Therefore, in triangle RST, angles at R, T, S are x, 2x, and 90° respectively. Summing them gives x + 2x + 90 = 180 ⇒ 3x = 90 ⇒ x = 30. Therefore, answer A.

So why did I initially think there was a contradiction? Because I confused which angle was the right angle. Once corrected, everything fits. So answer A is 30. Let me check if there are other possibilities. Could there be another configuration where RT is not a diameter? Well, since B is the center and lies on RT, RT must be a diameter. Because the only way for a line passing through the center to connect two points on the circle is if it's a diameter. Therefore, RT is indeed a diameter. Hence, the logic holds.

Another check: Let's imagine coordinates. Suppose B is at origin (0,0), radius 3. Let’s place R at (-3, 0), T at (3, 0), so RT is diameter. Then point S is another point on the circle. Let's pick S at (0, 3). Then triangle RST has vertices at (-3,0), (3,0), (0,3).

Compute angles:

Angle at R (∠SRT): Let's calculate using vectors or coordinate geometry.

Vectors from R to S: (0 - (-3), 3 - 0) = (3, 3)

Vector from R to T: (3 - (-3), 0 - 0) = (6, 0)

The angle between these two vectors is ∠SRT.

Using dot product:

cos(theta) = (3*6 + 3*0)/( |RS| * |RT| )

Wait, |RS| is sqrt(3² + 3²) = sqrt(18) = 3√2

|RT| is distance from R to T: 6 units.

Dot product is 3*6 + 3*0 = 18

Thus cos(theta) = 18 / (3√2 * 6) ) = 18/(18√2) ) = 1/√2 ⇒ theta = 45°. Wait, but according to our previous calculation, angle at R should be x, and angle at T should be 2x. In this case, angle at R is 45°, so x = 45°, but according to the equation above, we had x = 30°. Contradiction? What's wrong here?

Hmm, this suggests inconsistency. Wait, in this coordinate system, angle at R is 45°, angle at T is... Let's compute angle at T.

Vectors from T to R: (-6, 0)

From T to S: (0-3, 3-0) = (-3, 3)

Dot product between TR and TS vectors:

(-6)(-3) + (0)(3) = 18 + 0 = 18

|TR| is 6, |TS| is sqrt((-3)^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(18) = 3√2

So cos(theta) = 18/(6 * 3√2) ) = 18/(18√2) = 1/√2 ⇒ theta = 45°, so angle at T is 45°, which would imply that angle at S is 90°, so total angles 45+45+90=180. But according to our previous equations, angle at R is x, angle at T is 2x. Here, they are both 45°, which would suggest x = 45°, but according to the earlier calculation, we had x = 30°. There's a contradiction here. So where is the mistake?

Wait, in this specific coordinate example, angles at R and T are both 45°, which would mean that in general, the relationship depends on the position of S. So my initial assumption that angle at T is 2x and angle at R is x might not hold unless S is placed in a certain way. Therefore, my previous conclusion that x=30° may be incorrect. Therefore, there must be more to this problem.

Let me re-analyze. The problem does not specify where S is located on the circle except that it's on the circle centered at B with radius 3. So depending on where S is, angles at R and T change. So how do we determine x?

We know that in triangle RST, angles at R and T are x and 2x, and angle at S is 90°, as per Thales' theorem. Therefore, x + 2x + 90 = 180 ⇒ 3x = 90 ⇒ x = 30°. But in the coordinate example I chose, with S at (0,3), angles at R and T were both 45°, which would require x=45°, conflicting with the previous result. Therefore, there's an inconsistency here. Why?

Because in that coordinate example, the triangle RST wasn't satisfying the given angle conditions. So if we impose that angle at R is x and angle at T is 2x, then S cannot be at (0,3). Instead, S must be positioned such that those angle measures hold.

Therefore, perhaps I need to use the Law of Sines or Cosines in triangle RST.

In triangle RST, with RT as diameter (length 6), and angles at R = x, at T = 2x, at S = 90°. So applying the Law of Sines:

sin(x)/ST = sin(90°)/RT

Wait, Law of Sines says that in any triangle, a/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C.

So in triangle RST:

RS / sin(angle at T) = RT / sin(angle at S) = ST / sin(angle at R)

So:

RS / sin(2x) = RT / sin(90°) = ST / sin(x)

Since RT = 6, and sin(90°)=1, so:

RS / sin(2x) = 6 / 1 = 6 ⇒ RS = 6 sin(2x)

Similarly, ST / sin(x) = 6 ⇒ ST = 6 sin(x)

Also, by Pythagoras, since triangle RST is right-angled at S, RS² + ST² = RT².

Substituting RS and ST from above:

[6 sin(2x)]² + [6 sin(x)]² = 6²

Divide both sides by 6²:

[sin²(2x) + sin²(x)] = 1

Expand sin(2x) = 2 sinx cosx:

[ (2 sinx cosx)^2 + sin²x ] = 1

=> 4 sin²x cos²x + sin²x = 1

Factor sin²x:

sin²x (4 cos²x + 1) = 1

Now, recall that cos²x = 1 - sin²x. Substitute:

sin²x [4(1 - sin²x) + 1] = 1

Simplify inside the brackets:

4 - 4 sin²x + 1 = 5 - 4 sin²x

So:

sin²x (5 - 4 sin²x) = 1

Let me denote y = sin²x. Then:

y(5 - 4y) = 1

=> 5y - 4y² = 1

=> 4y² -5y +1 = 0

Quadratic equation: 4y² -5y +1 =0

Solving for y:

Discriminant D = 25 - 16 = 9

Roots: y=(5±3)/8

So y=(5+3)/8=8/8=1, or y=(5-3)/8=2/8=1/4

Case 1: y=1 ⇒ sin²x=1 ⇒ sinx=±1 ⇒ x=90° or 270°, but since x is an acute angle in a triangle, x=90°, but then angle at T would be 2x=180°, which is impossible. Disregard.

Case 2: y=1/4 ⇒ sin²x = 1/4 ⇒ sinx=1/2 or -1/2. Since x is positive and less than 90°, sinx=1/2 ⇒ x=30° or 150°, but 150° would make 2x=300°, which is impossible. So x=30°.

Therefore, x=30°, which corresponds to answer A. So even though in my coordinate example with S at (0,3), angles didn't fit, that was because I chose an arbitrary S. But when S is chosen such that the angles at R and T are x and 2x respectively, then x=30°. Therefore, the correct answer is A.

But wait, let me check with x=30°, what would be the coordinates of S.

If x=30°, then angle at R is 30°, angle at T is 60°, angle at S is 90°. Using Law of Sines:

RS = 6 sin(2x) = 6 sin(60°) = 6*(√3/2) = 3√3 ≈ 5.196

ST = 6 sin(x) = 6 sin(30°) = 6*(1/2) = 3

Then, RS² + ST² = (3√3)^2 + 3^2 = 27 + 9 = 36 = 6², which checks out. So this works. So in this scenario, S is located such that RS=3√3 and ST=3. Let me try to find coordinates for S.

Assume RT is horizontal from (-3,0) to (3,0). Let me find coordinates of S such that distance from R(-3,0) to S is 3√3, and from T(3,0) to S is 3. Let me set coordinates for S as (x,y). Then:

Distance from R to S: sqrt[(x +3)^2 + (y)^2] = 3√3 → (x+3)^2 + y² = 27 ...(1)

Distance from T to S: sqrt[(x-3)^2 + y²] = 3 → (x-3)^2 + y² = 9 ...(2)

Subtract equation (2) from (1):

(x+3)^2 - (x-3)^2 = 27 - 9 = 18

Expanding:

[x² +6x +9] - [x² -6x +9] = 12x = 18 → x = 18/12 = 3/2 = 1.5

So x=1.5. Plugging into equation (2):

(1.5 -3)^2 + y² = 9 → (-1.5)^2 + y² = 9 → 2.25 + y² = 9 → y² = 6.75 = 27/4 → y= ±(3√3)/2

So coordinates of S are (1.5, (3√3)/2) or (1.5, -(3√3)/2). Let's take the upper half for simplicity.

So S is at (1.5, (3√3)/2). Now let's check the angles.

First, vector from R to S: (1.5 - (-3), (3√3)/2 - 0) = (4.5, (3√3)/2)

Vector from R to T: (3 - (-3), 0 - 0) = (6, 0)

Angle at R between RS and RT is x=30°. Let's verify using dot product.

The angle between RS and RT vectors.

Dot product: (4.5)(6) + [(3√3)/2](0) = 27 + 0 = 27

Magnitude of RS vector: sqrt(4.5² + [(3√3)/2]^2 )

Calculate:

4.5 squared is 20.25

(3√3)/2 squared is (9*3)/4 = 27/4 = 6.75

Total magnitude squared: 20.25 + 6.75 = 27 → magnitude is sqrt(27) = 3√3

Magnitude of RT vector is 6.

Therefore, cos(theta) = 27 / (3√3 * 6) ) = 27 / (18√3) = 3/(2√3) = √3/2 ≈ 0.866. Therefore, theta = 30°, which confirms x=30°. Perfect!

Therefore, the correct value of x is 30°, corresponding to option A. So despite my confusion with the coordinate example, the mathematical derivation shows that x=30°, and the answer is A.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by interpreting the given geometric constraints and identifying key relationships among the points and angles involved.

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Geometric Setup**

We are told:
- $ \angle RTS = 2x $
- $ \angle SRT = x $
- Points $ R, T, S $ lie on a circle centered at point $ B $, each at a radius of 3.0.
- Point $ B $ lies on the straight line $ RT $.

This tells us that:
- $ B $ is the **center** of the circle.
- $ R $, $ T $, and $ S $ are **on the circumference**, so $ BR = BT = BS = 3.0 $.
- Since $ B $ lies on the line $ RT $, and it is the center of the circle, the segment $ RT $ must be a **diameter** of the circle.

---

### **Step 2: Applying Thales’ Theorem**

By **Thales’ Theorem**, any triangle inscribed in a circle where one side is the diameter will have a right angle opposite that diameter. In this case, since $ RT $ is the diameter, the angle subtended by $ RT $ at point $ S $ — i.e., $ \angle RST $ — must be a **right angle**, i.e., $ 90^\circ $.

So,
$$
\angle RST = 90^\circ
$$

---

### **Step 3: Using Triangle Angle Sum**

In triangle $ \triangle RST $, the three angles are:
- $ \angle SRT = x $
- $ \angle RTS = 2x $
- $ \angle RST = 90^\circ $

Using the fact that the sum of interior angles in a triangle is $ 180^\circ $, we write:
$$
x + 2x + 90^\circ = 180^\circ
$$
$$
3x = 90^\circ
\Rightarrow x = 30^\circ
$$

---

### **Step 4: Verifying Consistency**

We can also verify this using trigonometry. From the Law of Sines applied to triangle $ \triangle RST $, where $ RT = 6 $ (the diameter), we derive expressions for the lengths of $ RS $ and $ ST $ in terms of $ x $. Substituting into the Pythagorean identity confirms the consistency of the solution.

---

### **Conclusion**

All derivations consistently show that the measure of angle $ x $ is $ 30^\circ $.
