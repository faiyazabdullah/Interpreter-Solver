Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a rectangle JKLM and a rhombus MLP R. Wait, the notation might be important here. Let me parse that again. The first part says J K L M is a rectangle. So, points J, K, L, M form a rectangle. Then, M L P R is a rhombus. Hmm, so maybe the rhombus is MLPR? Because it's written as M L P R. So, the vertices of the rhombus are M, L, P, R. 

Let me sketch this mentally. Since JKLM is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. So, J connected to K connected to L connected to M connected back to J. So, in a rectangle, sides JK and LM are equal and parallel, KL and JM are equal and parallel. Now, the rhombus is MLPR. So, starting at point M, then L, then P, then R, and back to M? So, MLPR is a rhombus. That means all sides ML, LP, PR, RM are equal in length. Also, since it's a rh's, opposite angles are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary. 

Given that angle JMK is congruent to angle RMP, and measure of angle JMK is 55 degrees. Also, measure of angle MR P is 70 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle KLP. 

First, I need to figure out how these shapes are positioned relative to each other. Let me try to visualize or maybe draw a rough diagram. Let me consider rectangle JKLM. Let me assume coordinates for simplicity. Maybe assign coordinates to points to make calculations easier. 

But perhaps there's another way without coordinates. Let me think about angles. 

Starting with angle JMK. Point J, M, K. Since JKLM is a rectangle, so JM is one side. Let me recall that in rectangle JKLM, JM would be one of the sides. Wait, actually, in rectangle JKLM, the order of the letters matters. If it's J-K-L-M-J, then sides are JK, KL, LM, MJ. Therefore, JM is a diagonal? Wait no. Wait, JM connects J to M. In rectangle JKLM, J is connected to K and M. So, if you imagine rectangle with J at bottom left, K at bottom right, L at top right, M at top left. Then JM would be connecting J (bottom left) to M (top left), which is vertical side? No, wait, in that case, JM would be the left side. Wait, but in a rectangle, consecutive points. So, J to K is horizontal, K to L is vertical, L to M is horizontal (opposite direction), M to J is vertical. Wait, no. Wait, if it's a rectangle, then each corner has right angles. So, if J is connected to K and M. So, J is connected to K and M. So, JM is a diagonal? Or is it a side?

Wait, maybe I should clarify the structure. Let me label the rectangle JKLM. Let me think of it as follows:

- Points J, K, L, M arranged such that JKLM is a rectangle. So, moving around the rectangle, the order is J → K → L → M → J. So, sides JK, KL, LM, MJ. So, JM is a diagonal? Because J is connected to M via the side JM? Wait, no. Wait, if it's a rectangle, then sides are JK, KL, LM, and MJ. So, JM is a diagonal only if it's connecting J to M directly. Wait, but in a rectangle, diagonals are JL and KM. Wait, but JM is a side? Wait, no. Let me think again. If the rectangle is labeled in order, then each vertex is connected to the next. So, J connected to K, K connected to L, L connected to M, M connected to J. Therefore, JM is a diagonal because it connects J to M, skipping over K and L. Wait, but in a rectangle, the sides are JK, KL, LM, and MJ. Wait, so MJ is a side? But then if you go from M to J, that's a side. So, JM is a side. Wait, but then in that case, JM is one of the sides of the rectangle. For example, if the rectangle is standing on its base JK, then JM would be the left side. 

Alternatively, perhaps I need to assign coordinates. Let me try that approach. Let me place point J at (0,0). Since it's a rectangle, suppose JK is along x-axis, and JM is along y-axis. So, J(0,0), K(a,0), L(a,b), M(0,b). Then, sides JK is from (0,0) to (a,0); KL is from (a,0) to (a,b); LM is from (a,b) to (0,b)? Wait no, LM should connect to M. Wait, if M is at (0,b), then LM connects L(a,b) to M(0,b)? That would make LM horizontal line from (a,b) to (0,b), which would mean that LM is horizontal, same as JK. Then, MJ connects M(0,b) back to J(0,0), which is vertical. So yes, that makes sense. 

So, in this coordinate system, rectangle JKLM has coordinates J(0,0), K(a,0), L(a,b), M(0,b). Now, the rhombus is MLPR. So, points M, L, P, R. So, ML is from M(0,b) to L(a,b). Then, L to P, then P to R, then R back to M. Since it's a rhombus, all sides ML, LP, PR, RM are equal. 

Wait, ML is the segment from M(0,b) to L(a,b), which has length a. So, ML has length a. Therefore, since it's a rhombus, all sides must be length a. Therefore, LP, PR, RM also have length a. 

Now, let's note that angle JMK is congruent to angle RMP, and measure of angle JMK is 55°, and measure of angle MR P is 70°. Need to find measure of angle KLP. 

First, let's find angle JMK. Point J, M, K. So, angle at point M between points J, M, K. Wait, angle JMK is the angle at M between J, M, K. Wait, no. Wait, angle JMK is the angle at point M? Wait, no. In standard notation, angle JMK is the angle at point M between points J, M, K. Wait, no. Wait, angle JMK would be at point M? Wait, no. Wait, angle at point M? Wait, no. The middle letter is the vertex. So, angle JMK is at point M. So, vertex at M, with segments MJ and MK. Wait, but in our rectangle, MJ is from M(0,b) to J(0,0), which is straight down along the y-axis. And MK would be from M(0,b) to K(a,0). So, angle at M between MJ and MK. So, that angle is angle JMK. 

Similarly, angle RMP is the angle at point M between points R, M, P. So, vertex at M, with segments MR and MP. Given that angle JMK ≅ angle RMP, both are at point M. So, their measures are equal. Given that measure of angle JMK is 55°, so measure of angle RMP is also 55°. However, later they mention measure of angle MR P is 70°, which is angle at point R between points M, R, P. 

We need to find measure of angle KLP. Which is angle at point L between points K, L, P. 

Okay, so let me try to work through this. First, let me find coordinates for points P and R. Since MLPR is a rhombus. So, ML is from M(0,b) to L(a,b). Then, since it's a rhombus, the next side LP must be of length a, same as ML. Also, the direction of LP depends on the angles. 

Since ML is horizontal from M(0,b) to L(a,b). To construct rhombus MLPR, we need to determine points P and R such that MLPR is a rhombus. 

In a rhombus, adjacent sides are congruent and the sides are vectors that can be determined based on the previous side. Alternatively, since we know coordinates of M and L, perhaps we can find coordinates of P and R. 

Alternatively, maybe using vectors or slopes. Let me think. Let me denote vector ML. From M(0,b) to L(a,b): vector is (a, 0). Then, since it's a rhombus, the next side LP should have the same length and direction? Wait, no. In a rhombus, consecutive sides are vectors that are rotated by some angle. But since we don't know the angles, maybe it's better to use coordinates. 

Alternatively, since MLPR is a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other. But maybe that's more complicated. 

Alternatively, since ML is horizontal, and the rhombus MLPR, then from point L(a,b), we need to move in some direction to reach P, such that LP is length a, and then PR is length a, etc. 

Alternatively, considering that in rhombus MLPR, the sides ML, LP, PR, RM are all equal. So, starting from M(0,b), going to L(a,b). Then from L(a,b), moving in a direction such that LP is length a. Similarly, from P, moving to R, then from R back to M. 

Alternatively, since MLPR is a rhombus, the sides ML and MR are adjacent sides? Wait, MLPR is the order of the rhombus. So, the sides are ML, LP, PR, RM. Therefore, ML and LP are adjacent sides. So, vectors ML and LP are adjacent sides of the rhombus. 

Therefore, vector ML is (a,0) as before. Vector LP would be something. Since MLPR is a rhombus, the length of LP is equal to ML, which is a. 

But how do we find coordinates of P? Let me think. Let me denote point P as (x,y). Then, vector LP is from L(a,b) to P(x,y): (x - a, y - b). Its magnitude should be a. Also, since MLPR is a rhombus, the vector LP should be obtained by rotating vector ML by some angle. But since we have information about angles involving point M, maybe we can relate them. 

Alternatively, since we know angles at point M. Angle JMK is 55°, angle RMP is 55°, and angle MR P is 70°. Let me try to find relations between these angles. 

First, angle JMK is at point M between J, M, K. As mentioned earlier, this is the angle between MJ and MK. Let me calculate that angle using coordinates. 

Vector MJ goes from M(0,b) to J(0,0): direction is (0 - 0, 0 - b) = (0, -b). Vector MK goes from M(0,b) to K(a,0): direction is (a - 0, 0 - b) = (a, -b). So, the angle between vectors MJ (which is straight down) and MK (going to K). 

The angle between these two vectors can be found using dot product. The formula is cos(theta) = (v ⋅ w)/(|v||w|). 

So, vectors MJ is (0, -b), MK is (a, -b). Their dot product is (0)(a) + (-b)(-b) = b². The magnitude of MJ is sqrt(0² + (-b)^2) = b. The magnitude of MK is sqrt(a² + b²). Therefore,

cos(theta) = b² / (b * sqrt(a² + b²)) ) = b / sqrt(a² + b²)

Therefore, theta = arccos(b / sqrt(a² + b²)). This angle is given as 55 degrees. Therefore, arccos(b / sqrt(a² + b²)) = 55°. 

So, tan(theta) would be opposite over adjacent. Wait, theta is angle between MJ (vertical) and MK. Let me think of triangle formed by points M, J, K. Triangle MJK. Wait, but MJ is vertical, MK is slanting. Alternatively, in triangle MJK, we can compute tan(theta). 

From point M, looking at triangle MJK. The legs are MJ (length b) and the horizontal distance from M to K is a. Wait, no. Wait, from M(0,b) to K(a,0), the horizontal component is a units right, and vertical component is b units down. So, the angle at M between MJ (straight down) and MK is theta. So, tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent. If we imagine a right triangle where the horizontal leg is a and the vertical leg is b. Wait, but theta is between the vertical line (MJ) and the hypotenuse MK. So, tan(theta) would be horizontal change divided by vertical change. So, tan(theta) = a / b. 

Because, if we consider the right triangle formed by dropping a perpendicular from K to MJ. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, since angle between vertical line MJ and MK is theta, then tan(theta) = horizontal component / vertical component. The horizontal component is the horizontal distance from M to K, which is a, and the vertical component is the vertical distance from M to J, which is b. Therefore, tan(theta) = a/b. 

Therefore, tan(theta) = a/b = tan(55°). Therefore, a/b = tan(55°). Let me write that as equation (1).

Now, angle RMP is also 55°, which is the angle at M between points R, M, P. So, similar idea. Let me consider vectors MR and MP. 

Point R is part of the rhombus MLPR. Let me try to find coordinates of point P and R. Since MLPR is a rhombus. Let me think about the rhombus MLPR. Starting from M(0,b), then L(a,b), then P, then R, then back to M. 

Since MLPR is a rhombus, the sides ML, LP, PR, RM are all equal. So, ML has length a, as established earlier. Therefore, LP must also have length a. Also, since MLPR is a rhombus, the sides LP and MR are adjacent sides. Wait, ML is from M to L; LP is from L to P; PR is from P to R; RM is from R to M. So, vectors ML and LP are adjacent sides. 

To find coordinates of P, we can consider that vector LP must have length a, and direction such that the entire shape closes properly. 

Alternatively, since MLPR is a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other. However, without knowing specific coordinates, maybe this isn't immediately helpful. 

Alternatively, since angle at M between MR and MP is 55°, same as angle JMK. Let me see. So, angle RMP is 55°, meaning that at point M, between R and P. So, vectors MR and MP form a 55° angle. 

Let me try to express vectors MR and MP. 

First, vector MR goes from M(0,b) to R. But we don't know where R is yet. Similarly, vector MP goes from M(0,b) to P. 

But since MLPR is a rhombus, point R can be expressed in terms of other points. Let me think. Since MLPR is a rhombus, then PR must be equal to ML, which is a. Also, since MLPR is a rhombus, then vector MR should be equal to vector LP. Wait, not sure. 

Alternatively, since in a rhombus, opposite sides are parallel. So, ML is parallel to PR, and LP is parallel to MR. 

Vector ML is from M to L: (a, 0). Therefore, vector PR should be the same as vector ML, i.e., (a, 0). So, vector PR = vector ML = (a, 0). Therefore, if we can find coordinates of P and R such that vector PR = (a, 0). 

Also, since LP is a side of the rhombus, vector LP should be equal in magnitude to ML, which is a. Also, since LP is adjacent to ML. 

Alternatively, since MLPR is a rhombus, then after moving from M to L, then turning by some angle to get to P. 

Alternatively, maybe using complex numbers for coordinates. Let me think. 

But perhaps another approach. Since angle RMP is 55°, and angle JMK is also 55°, maybe those angles are related. 

Earlier, we had that tan(theta) = a/b = tan(55°), so a/b = tan(55°). Let me keep that in mind. 

Additionally, given that angle MR P is 70°, which is the angle at R between points M, R, P. So, angle MR P is 70°, which is angle at R between M-R-P. 

Our goal is to find angle KLP, which is the angle at L between K, L, P. 

Perhaps I need to find coordinates for P, then compute vectors to find that angle. 

Let me attempt to find coordinates for P and R. 

Since MLPR is a rhombus. So, from point L(a,b), moving in some direction to reach P. Let me assume that vector LP is some vector (let me call it vector v) such that |v| = a. Also, since MLPR is a rhombus, the vector from L to P should be equal to the vector from M to R? Not sure. 

Alternatively, since MLPR is a rhombus, then vectors ML and MR are adjacent sides? Wait, ML is from M to L, and MR is from M to R. Are they adjacent sides? If the rhombus is MLPR, then ML and MR are adjacent sides only if the rhombus is ordered M-L-P-R-M. Wait, no. Adjacent sides would be ML and LP, then LP and PR, etc. 

Alternatively, since MLPR is a rhombus, then vectors ML and LP are adjacent sides, so they should have the same length and the angle between them is one of the internal angles of the rhombus. 

But maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think differently. 

Given that angle MR P is 70°, which is at point R. So, in triangle MRP, angle at R is 70°. Also, since MLPR is a rhombus, sides MR and PR are equal? No, in a rhombus all sides are equal. So, MR is a side of the rhombus, so MR equals ML, which is a. Also, PR is a side, so PR equals a. 

So, triangle MRP has sides MR = a, PR = a, and angle at R is 70°. Therefore, triangle MRP is isoceles with MR = PR = a, and vertex angle at R being 70°. Therefore, the base angles at M and P are equal. Wait, but angle at R is 70°, so the sum of angles in triangle is 180°, so angles at M and P are (180 - 70)/2 = 55° each. 

Wait, so angle at M in triangle MRP is 55°, which is angle RMP. Wait, but angle RMP was given as 55°, which matches! So that confirms that angle RMP is indeed 55°, which aligns with the given information. 

So, that tells us that triangle MRP is isoceles with MR = PR and base angles at M and P each 55°, apex angle at R being 70°. 

So, from this, we can infer that in triangle MRP, MR = PR = a, and angle at R is 70°, angles at M and P are 55°. 

Now, since MR is a side of the rhombus MLPR, which has length a. Earlier, we had that ML is also length a. 

So, MR is another side of the rhombus, so MR = ML = a. 

But in our coordinate system, point M is (0,b), and point R is somewhere such that MR = a. Let me try to find coordinates for point R. 

But also, since MLPR is a rhombus, the coordinates of R can be determined based on other points. 

Alternatively, since in rhombus MLPR, the diagonals bisect each other. The diagonals are MP and LR. The midpoint of diagonal MP should coincide with midpoint of diagonal LR. 

But without knowing coordinates of P and R, this may not help directly. 

Alternatively, since we know that in triangle MRP, MR = PR = a, and angle at R is 70°, and angle at M is 55°, which we already used. 

Maybe we can find coordinates of R. 

Let me consider point R. Since MR has length a, and in our coordinate system, point M is at (0,b). Let me denote point R as (x,y). Then, distance from M(0,b) to R(x,y) is sqrt[(x - 0)^2 + (y - b)^2] = sqrt(x² + (y - b)^2) = a. So, x² + (y - b)^2 = a². Equation (1). 

Also, since PR = a. Point P is connected to R, so distance from P to R is a. But I don't know coordinates of P yet. 

Alternatively, since MLPR is a rhombus, vector MR should be equal to vector LP. Wait, in a rhombus, opposite sides are equal and parallel. So, vector ML is equal to vector PR, and vector LP is equal to vector MR. 

Vector ML is from M(0,b) to L(a,b): (a, 0). Therefore, vector PR should be equal to vector ML, which is (a, 0). So, vector PR = (a, 0). Therefore, if we can find coordinates of P and R such that vector PR = (a, 0), then we can find relation between P and R. 

Vector PR = R - P = (a, 0). So, R = P + (a, 0). 

Also, since MLPR is a rhombus, vector LP should be equal to vector MR. 

Vector LP is from L(a,b) to P(x,y): (x - a, y - b). 

Vector MR is from M(0,b) to R(x', y'): (x' - 0, y' - b) = (x', y' - b). 

Wait, but earlier we said vector LP = vector MR. So, (x - a, y - b) = (x', y' - b). But since R = P + (a, 0), then coordinates of R are (P_x + a, P_y + 0). So, if P is (p_x, p_y), then R is (p_x + a, p_y). 

Then, vector MR is from M(0,b) to R(p_x + a, p_y): (p_x + a - 0, p_y - b) = (p_x + a, p_y - b). 

And vector LP is from L(a,b) to P(p_x, p_y): (p_x - a, p_y - b). 

Setting vector LP = vector MR:

p_x - a = p_x + a => subtract p_x from both sides: -a = a => -a = a => implies a=0, which is impossible. So contradiction. 

Hmm, that suggests my assumption is wrong. Perhaps vector LP is equal to vector MR? Or maybe vector ML equals vector PR, which we did earlier. 

Wait, earlier I thought vector ML equals vector PR. Vector ML is (a,0), vector PR is R - P. So, if vector PR = vector ML, then R - P = (a,0), hence R = P + (a,0). 

But then, what about the other sides? For instance, vector LP should be equal to vector MR? Not sure. 

Alternatively, since MLPR is a rhombus, then the sides ML and LP are adjacent sides. So, vector ML and vector LP should have the same length, which they do (both length a). Also, the angle between them is one of the internal angles of the rhombus. 

But I still need more relations. 

Alternatively, since we know angle at M between MR and MP is 55°, and we know coordinates of M, maybe we can find coordinates of R and P such that angle RMP is 55°. 

Let me focus on angle RMP. At point M, between R and P. So, vectors MR and MP form an angle of 55°. 

Earlier, we had that angle JMK is also 55°, which gave us the relationship a/b = tan(55°). 

If I can find coordinates of P and R such that angle RMP is 55°, and also satisfy the conditions of the rhombus. 

Alternatively, since we know that in triangle MRP, MR = PR = a, angle at R is 70°, so we can find coordinates of R and P. 

Let me try that. In triangle MRP, with MR = PR = a, angle at R is 70°, so using the law of sines: 

sin(angle at M)/PR = sin(angle at R)/MP 

Wait, but angle at M is 55°, angle at R is 70°, angle at P is 55°. Therefore, sides opposite these angles: 

Side opposite angle at M (55°) is PR = a. 

Side opposite angle at R (70°) is MP. 

Side opposite angle at P (55°) is MR = a. 

So, by law of sines:

a / sin(70°) = MP / sin(55°) 

Thus, MP = [a * sin(55°)] / sin(70°)

Calculate numerical value: sin(55°) ≈ 0.8192, sin(70°) ≈ 0.9397 

So, MP ≈ a * 0.8192 / 0.9397 ≈ a * 0.872 

So, MP ≈ 0.872a 

But MP is the length from M to P. In our coordinate system, point P is part of the rhombus MLPR. 

But how does this help us? Well, if we can find coordinates of P such that MP ≈ 0.872a. 

Alternatively, since we know coordinates of M(0,b), and we want to find coordinates of P such that distance from M to P is MP ≈ 0.872a, and also that PR = a. 

But this seems too vague. Maybe there's another approach. 

Let me recall that in the rectangle, we had a/b = tan(55°), so a = b tan(55°). Let me denote tan(55°) as t, so a = bt. 

Let me try to express everything in terms of b. 

So, a = b tan(55°). Let me calculate tan(55°). Using calculator, tan(55°) ≈ 1.4281. 

So, a ≈ 1.4281b. 

Now, returning to triangle MRP. In triangle MRP, we have MR = PR = a, angle at R is 70°, and MP is computed as above. 

But maybe instead of working with lengths, I can find coordinates. Let me assume specific values for b to simplify calculations. Let me set b = 1 for simplicity. Then, a = tan(55°) ≈ 1.4281. 

So, let me take b = 1, then a ≈ 1.4281. Coordinates:

M(0,1), L(a,1) ≈ (1.4281,1), J(0,0), K(a,0) ≈ (1.4281,0). 

Now, need to find coordinates of P and R such that MLPR is a rhombus, with MR = PR = a ≈ 1.4281, and angle at R is 70°. 

But how? Let me think. 

Since MLPR is a rhombus, and we know ML is from M(0,1) to L(1.4281,1). Let me try to find point P such that LP = a and PR = a. 

Wait, from point L(1.4281,1), moving in some direction to reach P, then from P to R, then from R back to M(0,1). 

Alternatively, since MLPR is a rhombus, the position of P can be determined by rotating vector ML by some angle. 

But since we know angle at M between MR and MP is 55°, which is same as angle JMK. 

Alternatively, since angle JMK is 55°, and angle RMP is also 55°, perhaps lines MR and MJ are symmetric in some way? 

Wait, angle JMK is between MJ and MK, and angle RMP is between MR and MP. Both are 55°. Maybe MR is symmetric to MJ in some fashion? 

Alternatively, since MJ is downward vertical, and angle between MJ and MK is 55°, and angle between MR and MP is also 55°, perhaps MR is in some symmetrical position. 

This is getting too abstract. Let me try to use coordinates. 

Let me assume that point P lies somewhere in the plane, and try to find its coordinates. 

From earlier, we have in triangle MRP, MR = PR = a, angle at R is 70°, so we can find coordinates of R and P. 

Let me consider point R. Since MR = a, and M is at (0,1), then R lies somewhere on a circle centered at M with radius a. Similarly, PR = a, so P lies on a circle centered at R with radius a. 

But without more info, it's hard to pinpoint. 

Alternatively, since MLPR is a rhombus, and ML is known, maybe we can find coordinates of P and R using rotation. 

For example, in a rhombus, each side can be obtained by rotating the previous side by the internal angle. 

Vector ML is (a,0). Let's say the internal angle at point L is θ. Then, vector LP would be ML rotated by θ. 

But we don't know θ. However, in a rhombus, adjacent angles are supplementary. So, if one angle is θ, the adjacent angle is 180° - θ. 

Alternatively, since we know angle at M in the rhombus. Wait, in a rhombus, the angles depend on the specific shape. 

But we have some information about angles involving point M. 

At point M, we have angle JMK = 55°, which is between MJ and MK. And angle RMP = 55°, which is between MR and MP. 

Maybe these two angles relate to the angles of the rhombus. 

In the rhombus MLPR, the angles at M would be... Wait, the rhombus has four angles. At point M, which is one of the vertices. Depending on the rhombus, the angle at M could be either acute or obtuse. 

But we know that at point M, there are two angles: one between MJ and MK (which is 55°), and another between MR and MP (also 55°). Wait, but how can there be two different angles at the same point? Unless these angles are parts of larger angles. 

Wait, point M is part of both the rectangle and the rhombus. In the rectangle, from point M, we have sides MJ and ML. In the rhombus, from point M, we have sides ML and MR. Wait, ML is part of the rhombus, and MR is another side. So, at point M, in the rhombus, the angle between ML and MR would be one of the internal angles of the rhombus. 

But we also have angle JMK, which is between MJ and MK. How is this related? 

Let me try to visualize: at point M, there are several lines: 

- From the rectangle: MJ (downward vertical), and ML (horizontal right). 

- From the rhombus: ML (same as above), and MR (some direction). 

Also, from the rhombus, there is a side MP. 

Wait, in the rhombus MLPR, the sides at point M are ML and MR. So, the angle at M in the rhombus is between ML and MR. 

But we also have angle JMK, which is between MJ and MK. 

But how are these related? 

Possibly, the line MK passes through the rhombus? Or is there a relation between MK and MR or MP? 

Wait, MK is a diagonal of the rectangle. In the rectangle JKLM, diagonal from M to K. 

But in the rhombus MLPR, at point M, we have sides ML and MR. So, angle between ML and MR is one of the internal angles of the rhombus. 

But we also know that angle between MJ and MK is 55°, and angle between MR and MP is 55°. 

Maybe these angles are related to the angles of the rhombus. 

Let me try to find the angle at M in the rhombus. Let me denote the angle at M in the rhombus as φ. 

In the rhombus, adjacent angles are supplementary. So, if φ is the angle at M, then the angle at L is 180° - φ, and so on. 

But how does this relate to the given angles of 55°? 

At point M, there are two angles: one is between MJ and MK (55°), and another is between MR and MP (55°). These might be parts of the angles of the rhombus. 

Wait, if I consider the angle between ML and MR (which is φ), and the angle between MJ and MK (which is 55°). 

But ML is horizontal, from M to L. MJ is vertical downward. So, the angle between ML and MJ is 90°, since ML is horizontal and MJ is vertical. 

Wait, in the rectangle, ML is horizontal from M to L, and MJ is vertical from M to J. So, at point M, the angle between ML and MJ is 90°. 

But we have angle JMK = 55°, which is between MJ and MK. So, angle between MJ and MK is 55°, which means that line MK makes a 55° angle with MJ (which is vertical). 

So, line MK is going from M(0,b) to K(a,0). Earlier, we found that tan(theta) = a/b = tan(55°). 

Now, in the rhombus MLPR, at point M, the angle between ML and MR is φ. If we can find φ, then we can relate it to other angles. 

But how? 

We also know that angle RMP is 55°, which is between MR and MP. 

At point M, we have two lines: ML and MR, forming angle φ. And another line MP, forming angle 55° with MR. 

But what is the relationship between these angles? 

Maybe the total angle around point M? Wait, no, in planar geometry, the sum of angles around a point is 360°, but here we're dealing with specific angles. 

Wait, at point M, there are multiple lines: ML, MJ, MK, MR, and MP. 

But how are they arranged? 

ML is horizontal to the right. MJ is vertical down. MK is a diagonal from M to K. MR is some direction. MP is another direction. 

But without knowing exact positions, it's challenging. 

However, we know that angle between MR and MP is 55°, and angle between MJ and MK is 55°. 

Maybe there's a symmetry or relationship here. 

Let me try to think about the rhombus MLPR. Since it's a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. So, the diagonals of the rhombus intersect at 90° and bisect each other. 

But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, since we have triangle MRP with angle at R being 70°, and sides MR = PR = a. 

Let me try to find coordinates of R and P. 

Assume b = 1, a ≈ 1.4281. 

Let me consider point R such that MR = a. Let me parameterize point R. 

Let me assume that point R is somewhere in the plane such that distance from M(0,1) to R(x,y) is a. So, x² + (y - 1)² = a². 

Also, in triangle MRP, PR = a, so distance from P to R is a. 

But without knowing P, it's still difficult. 

Alternatively, since MLPR is a rhombus, and we know ML is (a,0), then vector PR should be equal to vector ML, so PR = (a,0). So, if I can find P such that R = P + (a,0). 

Let me denote P as (p_x, p_y). Then, R = (p_x + a, p_y). 

Now, since MLPR is a rhombus, the vector LP should be equal to vector MR. 

Vector LP is from L(a,1) to P(p_x, p_y): (p_x - a, p_y - 1). 

Vector MR is from M(0,1) to R(p_x + a, p_y): (p_x + a - 0, p_y - 1) = (p_x + a, p_y - 1). 

So, setting vector LP = vector MR: 

p_x - a = p_x + a ⇒ -a = a ⇒ a = 0, which is impossible. 

Contradiction again. So, this suggests that my assumption is wrong. 

Maybe vector LP is equal to vector MR? Wait, no, in a rhombus, opposite sides are equal and parallel, so vector ML = vector PR, and vector LP = vector MR. 

So, vector ML is (a,0), vector PR = vector ML, so PR = (a,0). Hence, R - P = (a,0), so R = P + (a,0). 

Vector LP = vector MR. Vector LP is P - L, and vector MR is R - M. 

Wait, vector LP = P - L, and vector MR = R - M. 

So, P - L = R - M. 

Substitute R = P + (a,0):

P - L = (P + (a,0)) - M 

=> P - L = P + (a,0) - M 

Subtract P from both sides: 

-L = (a,0) - M 

=> -L = (a,0) - M 

=> M = (a,0) + L 

But M is (0,1), L is (a,1). So, (a,0) + L = (a,0) + (a,1) = (2a,1). But M is (0,1), so this would require 2a = 0, implying a = 0, which is impossible. 

Again, contradiction. 

This suggests that my assumption that vector LP = vector MR is incorrect. Maybe I need to revisit the relationships in the rhombus. 

In a rhombus, consecutive sides are vectors that are not necessarily equal to each other, but all sides are equal in length. So, vector ML and vector LP are adjacent sides, and they should have the same length and meet at L. 

But since ML is from M to L, and LP is from L to P, then vector LP should be such that it starts at L and has the same length as ML. 

But without knowing the direction, it's hard to proceed. 

Maybe I should consider the fact that in the rhombus MLPR, the sides ML and LP are adjacent, so the angle between ML and LP is one of the internal angles of the rhombus. 

Let me denote this angle as φ. Then, the angle at L in the rhombus is φ, and the angle at M would be 180° - φ, since consecutive angles in a rhombus are supplementary. 

But how does this relate to the given angles? 

At point M, we have angle JMK = 55° and angle RMP = 55°. These might relate to the angles of the rhombus. 

Let me try to imagine the rhombus MLPR. At point M, the sides are ML and MR. The angle between ML and MR is the angle of the rhombus at M, which is 180° - φ, where φ is the angle at L. 

But how does this relate to the given angles? 

If I can find the angle at M in the rhombus, then I can relate it to the given angles. 

But how? 

Let me think about the line MK. In the rectangle, MK is a diagonal from M to K. This line passes through the rhombus? Or intersects it? 

At point M, we have two lines: ML (horizontal) and MR (some direction). The line MK is another line from M to K, making a 55° angle with MJ (vertical). 

Maybe the line MK is related to the rhombus. For example, if angle between MR and MP is 55°, and angle between MJ and MK is 55°, maybe line MK is aligned with line MP? 

If that were the case, then angle between MR and MK would be the same as angle RMP, which is 55°. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, since angle JMK is 55° and angle RMP is 55°, perhaps lines MK and MP are the same? Or some relation between them. 

Wait, if angle JMK is 55°, and angle RMP is 55°, and if MP is the same as MK, then that would mean that R is on the line MK. 

Let me explore this possibility. Assume that point P is on line MK. 

If P is on line MK, then MP is part of line MK. 

Given that, and since MLPR is a rhombus, let's see. 

If P is on line MK, then vector MP is along MK. 

From earlier, we had that in the rectangle, line MK goes from M(0,b) to K(a,0). 

So, parametric equations: any point on MK can be expressed as M + t(K - M) = (0,b) + t(a, -b), where t ∈ [0,1]. 

So, coordinates of P would be (ta, b - tb). 

Now, since MLPR is a rhombus, PR = ML = a. 

Let me find coordinates of R such that PR = a. 

But also, since MLPR is a rhombus, PR should be equal to ML and parallel to ML? Or not? 

Wait, in the rhombus MLPR, ML and PR are opposite sides, so they should be parallel and equal. 

Vector ML is (a, 0). So, vector PR should also be (a, 0). 

So, if P is (ta, b - tb), then R = P + (a, 0) = (ta + a, b - tb). 

Now, since MLPR is a rhombus, the other sides LP and MR should also be equal to a. 

Let me check vector LP: from L(a,b) to P(ta, b - tb): (ta - a, b - tb - b) = (a(t - 1), -tb). 

Length of LP should be a. 

So, sqrt[ (a(t - 1))^2 + (-tb)^2 ] = a 

Square both sides: a²(t - 1)^2 + t²b² = a² 

Divide both sides by a²: (t - 1)^2 + (t²b²)/a² = 1 

But from earlier, we had a/b = tan(55°), so a = b tan(55°). Let me substitute a = b tan(55°). 

So, a² = b² tan²(55°). 

Thus, the equation becomes: (t - 1)^2 + (t²b²)/(b² tan²(55°)) = 1 

Simplify: (t - 1)^2 + t² / tan²(55°) = 1 

Let me denote tan(55°) as t1 for simplicity. So, t1 = tan(55°). 

Thus, equation: (t - 1)^2 + t² / t1² = 1 

Expand (t - 1)^2: t² - 2t + 1 

So, t² - 2t + 1 + t²/t1² = 1 

Subtract 1 from both sides: t² - 2t + t²/t1² = 0 

Combine like terms: t²(1 + 1/t1²) - 2t = 0 

Factor: t [ t(1 + 1/t1²) - 2 ] = 0 

Solutions: t = 0 or t = 2 / (1 + 1/t1²) 

t = 0 would give P = M, which is trivial and not useful. So, the non-trivial solution is t = 2 / (1 + 1/t1²). 

Compute this value. Let me calculate t1 = tan(55°) ≈ 1.4281. 

So, 1/t1² ≈ 1/(1.4281²) ≈ 1/2.039 ≈ 0.490. 

So, denominator is 1 + 0.490 = 1.490. 

Thus, t ≈ 2 / 1.490 ≈ 1.342. 

But t is supposed to be a parameter along line MK, which ranges from 0 to 1 for points between M and K. However, t ≈ 1.342 > 1, which would place P outside the segment MK, beyond K. 

Is this acceptable? Yes, because P can be outside the segment. 

So, let's proceed. 

With t ≈ 1.342, coordinates of P are (ta, b - tb) = (1.342a, b - 1.342b) = (1.342a, -0.342b). 

Coordinates of R are P + (a, 0) = (1.342a + a, -0.342b) = (2.342a, -0.342b). 

Now, we need to verify if this satisfies other conditions, like angle MR P = 70°. 

Let me check. 

Point R is at (2.342a, -0.342b), point M is at (0,b), point P is at (1.342a, -0.342b). 

We need to find angle at R between M-R-P, which is angle MR P. 

To find this angle, we can use vectors. 

Vector RM = M - R = (0 - 2.342a, b - (-0.342b)) = (-2.342a, 1.342b). 

Vector RP = P - R = (1.342a - 2.342a, -0.342b - (-0.342b)) = (-a, 0). 

So, vector RM is (-2.342a, 1.342b), vector RP is (-a, 0). 

The angle between these vectors is angle at R, which should be 70°. Let me compute it. 

The cosine of the angle between vectors RM and RP is:

(RM ⋅ RP) / (|RM| |RP|)

Compute dot product: (-2.342a)(-a) + (1.342b)(0) = 2.342a² + 0 = 2.342a² 

|RM| = sqrt( (-2.342a)^2 + (1.342b)^2 ) = sqrt( (2.342²)a² + (1.342²)b² )

|RP| = sqrt((-a)^2 + 0^2) = a 

So, cos(theta) = 2.342a² / [ sqrt( (2.342²)a² + (1.342²)b² ) * a ] = 2.342a / sqrt( (2.342²)a² + (1.342²)b² )

Now, remember that a = b tan(55°), so let's substitute a = b tan(55°). 

Let me compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 2.342a = 2.342b tan(55°)

Denominator: sqrt( (2.342²)a² + (1.342²)b² ) = b * sqrt( (2.342²) tan²(55°) + (1.342²) )

Let me compute the value inside the square root:

First, calculate tan(55°) ≈ 1.4281 

So, 2.342² ≈ 5.484, 1.342² ≈ 1.800 

So, inside the sqrt: 5.484 * (1.4281)^2 + 1.800 

Calculate (1.4281)^2 ≈ 2.039 

So, 5.484 * 2.039 ≈ 5.484 * 2 + 5.484 * 0.039 ≈ 10.968 + 0.214 ≈ 11.182 

Add 1.800: 11.182 + 1.800 = 12.982 

So, denominator ≈ b * sqrt(12.982) ≈ b * 3.603 

Thus, cos(theta) ≈ (2.342b * 1.4281) / (3.603b) = (2.342 * 1.4281) / 3.603 

Calculate 2.342 * 1.4281 ≈ 2.342 * 1.4281 ≈ let's approximate:

2 * 1.4281 = 2.8562

0.342 * 1.4281 ≈ 0.342 * 1.4281 ≈ 0.488

Total ≈ 2.8562 + 0.488 ≈ 3.3442 

Then, divide by 3.603: 3.3442 / 3.603 ≈ 0.928 

So, cos(theta) ≈ 0.928, which corresponds to theta ≈ arccos(0.928) ≈ 21.5°. 

Wait, but we were expecting angle MR P to be 70°. This discrepancy suggests that our assumption that P lies on line MK is incorrect. 

Hmm, this indicates that my assumption that P is on line MK is wrong. So, this approach is flawed. 

I need to rethink. 

Let me return to the triangle MRP, where MR = PR = a, angle at R is 70°, and we found that MP = a * sin(55°)/sin(70°) ≈ 0.872a. 

If I can find coordinates of P such that distance from M to P is 0.872a, and distance from P to R is a, and distance from M to R is a. 

But how? 

Let me consider coordinates. Let me assume b = 1, a = tan(55°) ≈ 1.4281. 

So, M is at (0,1). Let me denote P as (x, y). Then, distance from M to P is sqrt(x² + (y - 1)^2) = 0.872a ≈ 0.872 * 1.4281 ≈ 1.245. 

Distance from P to R is a = 1.4281. 

Also, distance from M to R is a = 1.4281. 

So, R lies on a circle centered at M with radius a, and P lies on a circle centered at M with radius 1.245, and R lies on a circle centered at P with radius a. 

This seems too many variables. Maybe I need to use the law of cosines in triangle MRP. 

In triangle MRP, sides MR = PR = a, and MP = 0.872a. 

Using the law of cosines at angle R: 

MP² = MR² + PR² - 2 * MR * PR * cos(angle at R) 

Wait, but angle at R is 70°, so:

MP² = a² + a² - 2*a*a*cos(70°) 

MP² = 2a²(1 - cos(70°))

Which gives MP = a * sqrt(2(1 - cos(70°)))

Let me calculate this value. 

cos(70°) ≈ 0.3420, so 1 - 0.3420 = 0.6580 

So, MP = a * sqrt(2 * 0.6580) = a * sqrt(1.316) ≈ a * 1.147 

But earlier calculation using law of sines gave MP ≈ 0.872a. Contradiction? Wait, no. Wait, the law of sines said MP = a * sin(55°)/sin(70°) ≈ a * 0.8192 / 0.9397 ≈ 0.872a, while this law of cosines gives MP ≈ 1.147a. These should be consistent, so there must be an error. 

Wait, let me recheck the law of cosines. 

In triangle MRP, with sides MR = PR = a, angle at R is 70°, then by law of cosines:

MP² = MR² + PR² - 2*MR*PR*cos(angle at R)

Wait, but angle at R is between MR and PR, so it's the angle between sides MR and PR, which are both length a. 

Yes, so MP² = a² + a² - 2*a*a*cos(70°) = 2a²(1 - cos(70°)) 

But according to the law of sines, in triangle MRP, with angle at R = 70°, angle at M = 55°, angle at P = 55°, then sides opposite these angles are:

Side opposite 70° is MP, and sides opposite 55° are PR and MR. 

Wait, no. In triangle MRP, angle at R is 70°, so the side opposite is MP. Angles at M and P are 55°, so sides opposite are PR and MR, respectively. 

So, by law of sines: 

MP / sin(70°) = PR / sin(55°) 

Since PR = a, then MP = a * sin(70°)/sin(55°) ≈ a * 0.9397 / 0.8192 ≈ a * 1.147, which matches the law of cosines result. 

Earlier, I had mistakenly swapped the angles, leading to the wrong calculation. So, MP ≈ 1.147a. 

So, this shows that in triangle MRP, MP ≈ 1.147a. 

Now, with this information, let me try to find coordinates of P and R. 

Let me assume M is at (0,1), and P is some point such that distance from M to P is 1.147a. Let me choose coordinates for P. 

Let me assume that P lies somewhere in the plane. Let me try to find coordinates of P such that MP = 1.147a, and PR = a, with R lying on the circle centered at M with radius a. 

But this still leaves too many possibilities. 

Alternatively, since MLPR is a rhombus, and we know ML is from M(0,1) to L(a,1). Let me try to find vector from M to P, and vector from M to R, such that MLPR is a rhombus. 

But I'm stuck. 

Let me try to think about the angle KLP, which is the angle at L between K, L, P. 

Point K is at (a,0), point L is at (a,1), and point P is somewhere. 

To find angle KLP, I need to find the angle at L between points K, L, P. 

This requires knowing the coordinates of P. 

But without knowing P, it's hard to proceed. 

Maybe I can find vector LK and vector LP, then find the angle between them. 

Vector LK is from L to K: K - L = (a - a, 0 - 1) = (0, -1). 

Vector LP is from L to P: P - L = (px - a, py - 1). 

The angle between vector LK (0, -1) and vector LP (px - a, py - 1) is angle KLP. 

If I can find px and py, I can compute this angle. 

But how? 

Let me recall that P is part of the rhombus MLPR, so PR = a, and ML = a. 

Also, from earlier, in triangle MRP, we have MP ≈ 1.147a, and PR = a. 

But I still need to relate this to coordinates. 

Let me try to use the fact that in the rhombus MLPR, the diagonals bisect each other. The diagonals are MP and LR. 

Midpoint of MP should be the same as midpoint of LR. 

Let me denote midpoint of MP as ((mx + 0)/2, (my + 1)/2), assuming P is (mx, my). 

Midpoint of LR: L is (a,1), R is (rx, ry). Midpoint is ((a + rx)/2, (1 + ry)/2). 

Setting these equal: 

(mx/2, (my + 1)/2) = ((a + rx)/2, (1 + ry)/2) 

So, mx = a + rx and my + 1 = 1 + ry => my = ry. 

So, rx = mx - a, and ry = my. 

So, coordinates of R are (mx - a, my). 

Now, since PR = a, and P is (mx, my), R is (mx - a, my). So, vector PR is R - P = (mx - a - mx, my - my) = (-a, 0). So, vector PR is (-a, 0), which has length a, as needed. 

Also, since MLPR is a rhombus, vector ML = (a, 0), and vector PR = (-a, 0). So, ML and PR are equal in length and opposite in direction, which makes sense as opposite sides of the rhombus. 

Now, what about the other sides? LP and MR should also be equal to a. 

Vector LP is P - L = (mx - a, my - 1). Its length should be a. 

So, sqrt((mx - a)^2 + (my - 1)^2) = a 

Squaring: (mx - a)^2 + (my - 1)^2 = a². 

Also, since PR = a, and PR is from P to R, which we've already ensured. 

Now, we also know that in triangle MRP, MP = 1.147a. 

Point M is (0,1), P is (mx, my). So, distance from M to P is sqrt((mx - 0)^2 + (my - 1)^2) = sqrt(mx² + (my - 1)^2) = 1.147a. 

So, squaring: mx² + (my - 1)^2 = (1.147a)^2. 

But from the previous equation, (mx - a)^2 + (my - 1)^2 = a². 

Subtracting the two equations: 

[mx² + (my - 1)^2] - [(mx - a)^2 + (my - 1)^2] = (1.147a)^2 - a² 

Simplifying left side: mx² - (mx - a)^2 = mx² - (mx² - 2a mx + a²) = 2a mx - a² 

Right side: (1.147² - 1) a² ≈ (1.316 - 1) a² = 0.316a² 

So, 2a mx - a² = 0.316a² 

Divide both sides by a: 2mx - a = 0.316a 

So, 2mx = a + 0.316a = 1.316a => mx = 0.658a 

So, mx = 0.658a 

Now, substitute mx into one of the equations to find my. Let's use the equation from LP:

(mx - a)^2 + (my - 1)^2 = a² 

Substitute mx = 0.658a:

(0.658a - a)^2 + (my - 1)^2 = a² 

(-0.342a)^2 + (my - 1)^2 = a² 

0.1169a² + (my - 1)^2 = a² 

So, (my - 1)^2 = a² - 0.1169a² = 0.8831a² 

Take square roots: my - 1 = ±√0.8831a 

So, my = 1 ± √0.8831a 

Calculate √0.8831 ≈ 0.940 

So, my ≈ 1 ± 0.940a 

Now, we need to determine the sign. Since the rhombus MLPR is likely to be placed in a certain orientation, let's consider possible positions. 

If we take my = 1 + 0.940a, then point P would be above the rectangle, while if my = 1 - 0.940a, it would be below. 

But given that angle MR P is 70°, and we need to ensure consistency. Let me check both possibilities. 

Let me first assume my = 1 + 0.940a. 

Then, coordinates of P are (0.658a, 1 + 0.940a). 

Coordinates of R are (mx - a, my) = (0.658a - a, 1 + 0.940a) = (-0.342a, 1 + 0.940a). 

Now, let's check if this satisfies the condition that in triangle MRP, angle at R is 70°. 

Points M(0,1), R(-0.342a, 1 + 0.940a), P(0.658a, 1 + 0.940a). 

Vector RM = M - R = (0 - (-0.342a), 1 - (1 + 0.940a)) = (0.342a, -0.940a) 

Vector RP = P - R = (0.658a - (-0.342a), 1 + 0.940a - (1 + 0.940a)) = (1.0a, 0) 

So, vector RM is (0.342a, -0.940a), vector RP is (a, 0). 

The angle between these vectors is angle at R, which should be 70°. 

Let me calculate the cosine of the angle between these vectors: 

Dot product: (0.342a)(a) + (-0.940a)(0) = 0.342a² 

Magnitude of RM: sqrt( (0.342a)^2 + (-0.940a)^2 ) = a * sqrt(0.1169 + 0.8836) = a * sqrt(1.0005) ≈ a 

Magnitude of RP: sqrt(a² + 0) = a 

So, cos(theta) = 0.342a² / (a * a) = 0.342 

Thus, theta = arccos(0.342) ≈ 70°, since cos(70°) ≈ 0.3420. 

Perfect! This matches the given angle of 70° at R. 

So, this configuration is correct. 

So, now we have coordinates of P as (0.658a, 1 + 0.940a). 

Now, we need to find angle KLP, which is the angle at L between points K, L, P. 

Point K is (a,0), point L is (a,1), and point P is (0.658a, 1 + 0.940a). 

Vector LK is from L to K: K - L = (a - a, 0 - 1) = (0, -1) 

Vector LP is from L to P: P - L = (0.658a - a, 1 + 0.940a - 1) = (-0.342a, 0.940a) 

Now, the angle between vector LK (0, -1) and vector LP (-0.342a, 0.940a) is
