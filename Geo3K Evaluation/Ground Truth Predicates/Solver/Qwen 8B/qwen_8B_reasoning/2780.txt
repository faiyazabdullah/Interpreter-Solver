MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given information and figure out how the different elements relate to each other. 

So, the problem states several geometric constraints:

1. The measure of arc BE is 120 degrees. That means if we look at circle D (since points B and E are on Circle D), the arc between B and E is 120°. 

2. Point E lies on line AB. So, point E is somewhere along the line that connects points A and B. Wait, but E is also on the circle centered at D with radius 3.0. Also, point B is on that same circle. So, both B and E are points on circle D, which implies that segment BE is a chord of the circle. Since the arc BE measures 120°, the central angle corresponding to that arc would be equal to the measure of the arc. Therefore, the central angle ∠BDE (if D is the center) would be 120°. 

Wait, hold on. Let me confirm. In a circle, the measure of an arc is equal to the measure of its central angle. So yes, if arc BE is 120°, then the central angle subtended by BE is 120°, meaning ∠BDE = 120°, since D is the center. 

Now, the next part: Angle(C, B, A) equals Angle(9). So, angle ABC (assuming standard notation where the middle letter is the vertex) is equal to angle 9. We need to find the measure of angle 9, which is the same as angle ABC. 

Also, point E lies on line AB. So, E is a point on AB such that it's also on circle D. Since B is on circle D, and E is another point on the same circle, so BE is a chord of the circle. 

Let me try to visualize this. There's a circle with center D. Points B and E are on the circumference. The arc BE is 120°, so the central angle for that arc is 120°, making triangle BDE an isosceles triangle with DB = DE (radii of the circle). 

But wait, point E is on line AB. So, line AB passes through point B and extends to point E, which is on the circle. So, maybe E is another intersection point of line AB with the circle? But since B is already on the circle, line AB intersects the circle at B and E. So, E is another point where line AB meets the circle. 

Therefore, AB is a secant line passing through the circle at points B and E. Now, angle ABC is formed at point B, with segments BA and BC. Wait, but where is point C? The problem mentions angle(C, B, A), which is angle ABC. So, point C must be some other point in the diagram. However, there's no direct information about point C except that it's related to angle ABC. 

Hmm, perhaps there's more information missing here? Or maybe we can infer something else. Let me think again. 

Since E is on line AB and on circle D, and arc BE is 120°, which gives us some relationship between angles involving points B, E, and possibly other points. 

Angle ABC is given to be equal to angle 9. Our goal is to find angle 9. Maybe angle ABC relates to the arcs or angles in the circle? 

Alternatively, perhaps angle ABC is an inscribed angle or something similar. Let me consider possible relationships. 

If we can find the measure of angle ABC, then that would give us the measure of angle 9. To find angle ABC, maybe we can use properties of circles, triangles, or other angles. 

Let me recall that when you have a point outside a circle, the angle formed by two secants, tangents, or a secant and tangent can be related to the arcs they intercept. But in this case, point C might be inside or outside the circle. Wait, but without knowing where point C is, it's hard to say. 

Wait, but maybe angle ABC is related to the arc BE. Because point E is on AB, and B is connected to E. If we consider triangle ABE, but I don't know where point C is. Alternatively, perhaps angle ABC is an inscribed angle or an exterior angle. 

Wait, let's think about the position of point C. Since angle ABC is mentioned, point C must be somewhere such that lines BA and BC form the angle. Since E is on line AB, and B is on the circle, perhaps point C is another point on the circle? Or maybe not. 

Alternatively, maybe triangle ABC has some relation to the circle. For example, if point C is also on the circle. Wait, but the problem only mentions points B and E being on circle D. There's no mention of point C being on the circle. 

Wait, unless point C is the center D? No, because the center is D, but the problem refers to angle(C, B, A), which would be angle at point B between points C and A. If C were the center D, then angle ABD would be... Hmm, but the problem says angle(C, B, A), which is angle ABC. So, if C were D, then angle ABD. But we don't know that. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Let's consider triangle ABE. Since E is on line AB and on the circle, and B is on the circle. Let me consider the power of a point. But maybe that's overcomplicating. 

Wait, since E is on AB and on the circle, then AE * AB = (power of A with respect to circle D). But unless we know lengths, this may not help directly. 

Alternatively, since we know the arc BE is 120°, which corresponds to central angle BDE = 120°, as before. Then, if we can find some relationship between angle ABC and these arcs. 

Suppose angle ABC is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc BE or something. But angle ABC is at point B, so if we consider angle ABC, which is formed by points A, B, C. If point C is on the circle, then maybe angle ABC is an inscribed angle. Wait, but if point C is on the circle, then angle ABC would intercept some arc. 

Alternatively, maybe angle ABC is formed by a tangent and a chord? If line BC is tangent to the circle at B, then angle ABC would be equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc. But we don't know if BC is tangent. 

Alternatively, maybe triangle ABC is related to the circle in some way. 

Alternatively, since E is on AB, and BE is a chord of the circle, maybe angle ABC relates to angle ABE? Let me see. If we consider triangle ABE, since E is on AB, but that seems trivial. 

Wait, perhaps angle ABC is equal to half the measure of arc BE? If angle ABC is an inscribed angle. But angle ABC is at point B, so if it's an inscribed angle, it would need to intercept an arc opposite to it. But unless point C is positioned such that angle ABC intercepts arc BE. 

Wait, suppose that point C is such that BC is tangent to the circle at B. Then, the angle between tangent BC and chord BE would be equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc. Wait, the angle between tangent and chord is half the measure of the intercepted arc. 

In that case, if BC is tangent to the circle at B, then angle between tangent BC and chord BE would be equal to half the measure of arc BE. Since arc BE is 120°, then that angle would be 60°. So angle between BC and BE would be 60°, which could be angle EBC. But angle ABC is at point B between BA and BC. 

But if E is on AB, then BE is part of AB. So, if E is on AB, then BE is just a segment from B to E along AB. So, if angle between BC and BE is 60°, then angle EBC is 60°, but angle ABC is adjacent to that. Wait, since E is on AB, then BA is extended beyond B to E? Or is E between A and B?

Wait, the problem says PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(A,B)). So, point E lies on line AB. It could be either between A and B, or extending beyond A or B. But since B is on the circle, and E is also on the circle, and arc BE is 120°, then the length of BE depends on the radius. 

Assuming the circle has radius 3.0 units. So, the distance between B and E is 2r sin(theta/2), where theta is the central angle. Wait, for central angle θ, chord length is 2R sin(θ/2). Here, R=3, θ=120°, so chord BE = 2*3*sin(60°)= 6*(√3)/2 = 3√3 ≈ 5.196. 

But how does that help us? Not sure yet. 

Back to angle ABC. Suppose that BC is tangent to the circle at point B. Then, angle between tangent BC and chord BE is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc. The intercepted arc would be arc BE, which is 120°, so the angle would be 60°. Therefore, angle EBC = 60°. But angle ABC is the angle between BA and BC. Since E is on line AB, then BA is going from B to A, and BE is from B to E. Depending on where E is located, BE could be in the direction towards A or away from A. 

If E is on line AB beyond B, then BE would be extending from B away from A. If E is between A and B, then BE would be from B towards A. 

But since E is on the circle, and B is on the circle, then if E is not coinciding with B, the line AB passes through B and E. So, depending on the position, E could be on either side. 

But the arc BE measures 120°, which suggests that the central angle is 120°, so the points B and E are separated by 120° on the circle. 

Assuming the circle is oriented such that moving from B to E along the circumference covers 120°, then the chord BE forms an isosceles triangle with the center D. 

Now, if BC is tangent to the circle at B, then angle between BC and BE is 60°, as above. If E is on line AB, then angle EBC is 60°, and angle ABC would depend on the direction of BE relative to BA. 

For instance, if E is on the extension of AB beyond B, then BE is in the direction away from A. Then, angle between BE and BC would be 60°, and since BA is in the opposite direction of BE, angle ABC would be supplementary to angle EBC. Wait, if E is on the extension of AB beyond B, then BA is from B to A, and BE is from B to E (away from A). So, if BC makes an angle of 60° with BE (tangent), then angle between BC and BA would be 180° minus 60°, which is 120°. 

But if E is between A and B, then BE is from B towards A. Then, angle between BE and BC would still be 60°, but since BE is in the direction towards A, angle ABC would be the same as angle between BA and BC, which would be 60°, assuming BC is tangent. 

Wait, but which scenario is correct? How do we determine whether E is between A and B or not? 

The problem doesn't specify, but since arc BE is 120°, which is less than 180°, so points B and E are on the circle such that they're separated by 120°, so they are not diametrically opposed. 

But regardless of their positions, if BC is tangent to the circle at B, then angle EBC is 60°, and depending on where E is, angle ABC could be 60° or 120°. 

However, the question asks for angle 9, which is equal to angle ABC. So, if angle ABC is 60°, then answer is A; if it's 120°, then answer is B. 

But how do we decide which one it is? 

Perhaps considering the possibility that angle ABC is an inscribed angle. Wait, if point C is on the circle, then angle ABC would be an inscribed angle. But we don't know where point C is. 

Alternatively, maybe triangle ABC is related to the circle in some way. 

Wait, another approach: using the fact that E is on AB and on the circle. Let's consider triangle ABE. Since E is on AB, then AE + EB = AB (if E is between A and B) or |AE - EB| = AB (if E is beyond B). But without knowing specific lengths, it's tricky. 

Alternatively, since we know the arc BE is 120°, and if we can find some relationship between angle ABC and that arc. 

Another thought: if we draw BD and ED (the radii), forming triangle BDE with central angle 120°, making triangle BDE an isosceles triangle with BD=ED=3. 

Now, if we consider point C such that angle ABC is formed. Perhaps there's a way to relate angle ABC to triangle BDE. 

Alternatively, maybe angle ABC is an external angle to triangle BDE. 

Wait, if I imagine line AB intersecting the circle at B and E, and then drawing BC such that angle ABC is formed. If BC is such that it creates an angle related to the circle's properties. 

Wait, earlier assumption was that BC is tangent to the circle at B, leading to angle EBC being 60°, hence angle ABC being 60° or 120°. 

But why assume BC is tangent? Unless there's a reason. 

Wait, but the problem didn't state anything about BC being tangent. So maybe that's incorrect. 

Alternative idea: since E is on AB and on the circle, then AB is a secant line passing through the circle at B and E. Then, applying the formula for the angle between a secant and a chord. 

Wait, the angle between a secant and a chord is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. 

But angle ABC is at point B, between BA and BC. If BC is another secant or tangent. 

Wait, but if we consider angle ABC, which is formed by BA (which is a secant) and BC. If BC is another secant, then we might apply the formula for angles formed by two secants. 

But without knowing where point C is, this is challenging. 

Alternatively, if point C is also on the circle, then angle ABC would be an inscribed angle. For example, if C is another point on the circle, then angle ABC would intercept some arc. 

But how would that work? Let me think. If C is on the circle, then angle ABC would intercept arc AC. But without knowing where C is, it's unclear. 

Wait, but maybe there's more info. Let me check the original problem again. 

Original problem mentions that angle(C, B, A) equals angle 9. So, angle ABC is equal to angle 9. And we need to find angle 9. 

We also know that arc BE is 120°, which is a key piece of information. 

Is there a way to relate angle ABC to arc BE? 

Maybe if we consider triangle ABE. Let me think. Since E is on AB and on the circle, and arc BE is 120°, then the central angle is 120°, so angle BDE is 120°. 

But how does this relate to angle ABC? 

Alternatively, maybe triangle ABE has some known angles. For example, if we can find angles at B. 

But without knowing lengths, it's difficult. 

Wait, here's another thought. If we consider the circle with center D, and points B and E on the circle. Then, line BE is a chord subtending 120° at the center. 

If we construct triangle ABE, then angle at B is angle ABE. But how does that relate to angle ABC? 

If angle ABC is the same as angle ABE, then angle ABC would be equal to angle ABE. 

But angle ABE is an angle in triangle ABE. Let's calculate it. 

In triangle ABE, we know BE is a chord of the circle with length 3√3 as calculated earlier (radius 3, central angle 120°). 

But we don't know AB or AE. However, if we consider triangle ABE, we might need more information. 

Alternatively, if we consider triangle BDE, which is an isosceles triangle with sides BD=DE=3, and angle at D being 120°. So, the base angles at B and E are equal. 

Calculating those base angles: sum of angles in triangle is 180°, so each base angle is (180-120)/2 = 30°. So, angle at B is 30°, which is angle DBE. 

So, angle DBE = 30°. 

Now, if we can relate angle DBE to angle ABC. 

But angle DBE is at point B between points D and E. If we can relate this to angle ABC. 

But where is point C? If point C is D, then angle ABC would be angle ABD. But angle ABD is part of angle DBE? 

Wait, if point C is D, then angle ABC would be angle ABD. But angle DBE is 30°, but angle ABD depends on where A is. 

But we don't know where A is. 

This seems too vague. Maybe there's another approach. 

Wait, going back to the initial assumption about the tangent. If angle between tangent BC and chord BE is 60°, and if E is on AB, then angle ABC could be 60° or 120°, depending on the position of E. 

But which one is it? 

If E is on AB extended beyond B, then BE is in the direction away from A. Then, the tangent BC would make an angle of 60° with BE. So, if we imagine standing at point B, looking along BE (away from A), then the tangent BC would be at 60° from BE. Since BA is in the opposite direction of BE, then the angle between BA and BC would be 180° - 60° = 120°. 

On the other hand, if E is between A and B, then BE is in the direction towards A. Then, the tangent BC would make a 60° angle with BE (which is towards A), so the angle between BA and BC would be 60°, since BA is in the same direction as BE. 

But how do we know which case applies? 

Well, the arc BE measures 120°, which is less than 180°, so points B and E are on the circle such that they are not diametrically opposite. This suggests that the arc BE is less than a semicircle. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's ambiguous. However, the problem likely assumes a standard configuration where E is not between A and B, but rather on the extension of AB beyond B. This is because if E were between A and B, then arc BE would be a minor arc, but the position of E on line AB could vary. 

However, this is speculative. Another way to think is that since arc BE is 120°, which is a major arc or minor arc? Well, typically, the measure of an arc is the smaller one unless specified otherwise. So arc BE is 120°, which is a minor arc. 

But if the arc BE is 120°, then the central angle is 120°, and the chord BE is fixed. 

Now, if E is on line AB, then the position of E determines whether it's on one side or the other. But if arc BE is 120°, then the chord BE subtends that arc. 

Assuming that the arc BE is the minor arc, then the points B and E are placed such that moving from B to E along the minor arc is 120°. 

But how does that affect the position of E on line AB? 

It depends on the orientation of the circle. Without loss of generality, let's imagine the circle with center D. Let me place point B at coordinates (say) (3, 0), since the radius is 3.0. Then, point E would be located 120° around the circle from B. 

If the circle is centered at D (let's say at origin for simplicity), then point B is at (3, 0). Moving 120° counterclockwise around the circle, point E would be at (3 cos 120°, 3 sin 120°). Calculating that: cos(120°) is cos(180°−60°) = -cos(60°) = -0.5, and sin(120°) is sin(60°) = √3/2. So, E would be at (-1.5, (3√3)/2). 

Then, line AB passes through point B (3,0) and point E (-1.5, (3√3)/2). Wait, but E is supposed to lie on line AB. So, in this coordinate system, line AB goes through B (3,0) and E (-1.5, ...). So, point A must be somewhere on this line. 

But where is point A? It's not specified. However, we need to find angle ABC. Assuming that point C is such that BC is tangent to the circle at B. 

If we take the previous setup, with D at (0,0), B at (3,0), E at (-1.5, (3√3)/2). Then, the tangent at point B to the circle would be perpendicular to the radius DB. The radius DB is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (3,0), so the tangent at B is vertical. Thus, the tangent line at B is the y-axis. 

So, if BC is the tangent at B, then line BC is the y-axis. So, point C is somewhere along the y-axis. 

Now, angle ABC is the angle at point B between points A and C. Since point A is on line AB, which we've defined as passing through B (3,0) and E (-1.5, ...). Let's parametrize line AB. 

Parametric equations for line AB: starting at B (3,0), going through E (-1.5, (3√3)/2). Let's compute the slope of BE. The change in y is [(3√3)/2 - 0] = (3√3)/2, and change in x is [-1.5 - 3] = -4.5 = -9/2. So slope m = [(3√3)/2] / (-9/2) = -√3/3 = -1/√3. 

Thus, the equation of line AB is y - 0 = -1/√3 (x - 3). 

Now, point A is somewhere on this line. Let's assume that point A is on the extension of BE beyond B, or on the other side. Wait, in our coordinate system, point E is at (-1.5, ...) which is to the left of B (at x=3). So, line AB goes from B (3,0) through E (-1.5, ...). So, point A could be on the extension of BE beyond E, or on the other side. But since E is on the circle, and we need to define point A such that line AB passes through E. 

But regardless, angle ABC is formed at B between BA and BC. Since BC is the tangent line at B (y-axis), and BA is the line AB with slope -1/√3. 

So, angle between BA and BC is the angle between line AB (slope -1/√3) and the y-axis (vertical line). 

To find this angle, we can compute the angle between the two lines. The slope of BA is -1/√3, which corresponds to an angle θ below the horizontal axis. The tangent of this angle is |m| = 1/√3, so θ = arctan(1/√3) = 30°. 

Since the line BA is sloping downward from B to the right (as the slope is negative), the angle between BA and the positive x-axis is 30° below the x-axis. The tangent line BC is the y-axis, which is vertical. 

The angle between BA and BC would be the complement of 30°, because the angle between BA and the x-axis is 30°, and the angle between x-axis and y-axis is 90°, so total angle between BA and BC is 90° - 30° = 60°. 

Wait, let me clarify. The line BA makes a 30° angle below the x-axis (since slope is -1/√3). The y-axis is straight up. So, the angle between BA and the y-axis is measured from the y-axis down to BA. 

Imagine standing at point B, facing along the y-axis (upwards). The line BA slopes downwards to the right at 30° from the x-axis. The angle between BA and the y-axis would be 90° - 30° = 60°. Hence, angle ABC is 60°. 

Therefore, angle 9 is 60°, which corresponds to option A. 

But wait, earlier we considered two possibilities: angle ABC could be 60° or 120°. But according to this calculation, it's 60°. 

However, let me verify once again. 

The slope of BA is -1/√3, which means it makes a 30° angle with the x-axis (since tan(30°) = 1/√3). Since the slope is negative, it's 30° below the x-axis. The tangent line BC is the y-axis. The angle between BA and the y-axis is therefore 90° - 30° = 60°, yes. So angle ABC is 60°, making answer A. 

But wait, earlier I thought that if E is on the extension of AB beyond B, then angle ABC could be 120°, but in this coordinate system, with E on the other side of B, we get 60°. Why is that? 

Ah, because in this coordinate system, point E is on the line AB, but in this case, line AB passes through B and E, with E located at (-1.5, ...). So, line AB extends from E through B to point A. So, point A is on the extension of BE beyond E, or on the other side? 

Actually, in this case, since E is on line AB, and we've placed E to the left of B, then point A could be on the other side of B from E. Wait, but in our setup, line AB passes through B and E, so point A could be anywhere on that line. For example, if we take A to be on the opposite side of B from E, then BA would extend from B through A. 

But regardless of where A is, the angle between BA and BC (the tangent) depends on the slope of BA. In this case, we computed it as 60°, which would mean angle ABC is 60°, leading to answer A. 

However, there's another possibility if the tangent is on the other side. Wait, but the tangent at point B is unique—it's perpendicular to the radius. Since the radius at B is along the x-axis from D(0,0) to B(3,0), the tangent at B is vertical, as previously stated. So BC must be along the vertical tangent line. 

Hence, the angle between BA and BC is 60°, making angle ABC = 60°, so answer A. 

But why did I initially think it could be 120°? Because if E were on the other side, but in this configuration, with E on the left of B, the calculation shows 60°. 

Alternatively, if point C were on the other side of the tangent, but that would change the angle. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another interpretation. Suppose that instead of BC being tangent, it's a secant. But without more info, it's hard to say. 

But based on the previous analysis, assuming that BC is tangent, giving angle ABC as 60°, which matches option A. 

But let me check if there's another way this could be derived. 

Another approach: since arc BE is 120°, the inscribed angle subtended by arc BE would be half that, which is 60°. An inscribed angle subtended by arc BE would be at any point on the circumference not containing BE. 

But if angle ABC is an inscribed angle subtended by arc BE, then it would be 60°, making angle ABC = 60°, hence answer A. 

However, for angle ABC to be an inscribed angle subtended by arc BE, point C must lie on the circumference such that when you connect BC and BA, the angle at B intercepts arc BE. 

But in this case, point C would need to be positioned such that arc BE is intercepted by angle ABC. 

If point C is on the circumference, then yes. But how do we know that? 

The problem doesn't explicitly say that point C is on the circle. But if we assume that angle ABC is an inscribed angle, then it would be 60°, matching our earlier conclusion. 

Given that the answer choices include 60° (option A), and based on multiple approaches pointing to 60°, I think the correct answer is A. 

But wait, another thought: if angle ABC is actually an external angle to the circle, like an external angle formed by two secants. 

The formula for the measure of an angle formed by two secants intersecting outside the circle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. 

But in this case, if point B is on the circle, and angle ABC is formed by secants BA and BC, where one of them is a secant (BA) and the other is... if BC is another secant or tangent. 

Wait, if point C is outside the circle, and BA is a secant passing through B and E, then angle ABC would be equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. 

But without knowing where C is, it's difficult. However, if we assume that BC is tangent to the circle at B, then it's a tangent, and BA is a secant. Then, the angle between tangent BC and secant BA is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. 

The intercepted arcs would be the arc from B to E (which is 120°) and the arc from B to... well, since the tangent is at B, the other arc would be the arc that's opposite. Wait, the formula is: angle = ½(measure of intercepted arc - measure of opposite arc). 

But since the tangent is at point B, the intercepted arc is the arc that is opposite to the angle. In this case, the angle between tangent BC and secant BE would intercept arc BE. Wait, no—when you have a tangent and a secant, the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Specifically, if the tangent is at B and the secant passes through B and E, then the angle is ½(arc BE - arc...? Wait, the angle formed by a tangent and a secant is ½(measure of the intercepted arc). Wait, no—the formula is: the measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a secant is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. 

In this case, the angle at B between tangent BC and secant BE would be ½(measure of arc BE - measure of arc...? Wait, there's only one arc intercepted here. Wait, no. When you have a tangent and a secant meeting at a point on the circle, the angle is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc. 

Yes! Because the angle between a tangent and a chord is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc. 

So, in this case, angle between tangent BC and chord BE is equal to ½ arc BE. Arc BE is 120°, so the angle is 60°, which would be angle EBC. 

But angle ABC is the angle between BA and BC. Since E is on line AB, then BE is part of BA. So, if E is on AB, then angle EBC is the same as angle ABC. Wait, no—if E is on AB, then BE is a segment from B to E on AB. So, if BC is the tangent at B, then angle between BE and BC is 60°, which is angle EBC. But angle ABC is the angle between BA and BC. 

Since E is on line AB, then BA is a straight line extending from B through A. If E is between B and A, then BE is part of BA. If E is on the extension of AB beyond B, then BE is in the direction away from A. 

Assuming that E is on the extension of AB beyond B (so BE is away from A), then the angle between BE (away from A) and BC (tangent) is 60°, as per the tangent-chord angle. Then, angle ABC is the angle between BA (which is in the opposite direction of BE) and BC. So, if BE is away from A, then BA is in the opposite direction. So, the angle between BA and BC would be 180° - 60° = 120°. 

Wait, this contradicts the previous calculation. What's wrong here? 

Earlier, in the coordinate system, we assumed E was on the left of B, and got angle ABC as 60°, but this new reasoning suggests it could be 120°. 

Which one is correct? 

Let me re-examine the coordinate system. 

In the coordinate system where D is at (0,0), B is at (3,0), and E is at (-1.5, (3√3)/2). Line AB passes through B and E. Let's assume point A is on the extension of BE beyond E, so that line AB goes from A through E to B. 

In this case, BA is from B to A, which would be in the direction from B towards A, which is opposite to the direction from B to E. 

If BC is the tangent at B (vertical line upwards), then angle between BE (from B to E, which is towards the left and upward) and BC (vertical) is 60°, as previously calculated. But angle ABC is the angle between BA (which is from B to A, i.e., opposite direction of BE) and BC. 

So, if BE is going left and up, BA is going right and down (since A is on the extension of BE beyond E, so from B to A is the opposite direction of BE). 

So, the angle between BA (right-down) and BC (upward) would be the angle between BA and BC. 

Previously, we calculated the angle between BA (slope -1/√3) and the y-axis (vertical) as 60°, which suggests that angle ABC is 60°. 

But why is this conflicting with the earlier statement about the tangent-chord angle? 

Because the angle between tangent BC and chord BE is 60°, but angle ABC is between BA and BC, not between BE and BC. 

If BA is in the opposite direction of BE, then the angle between BA and BC is supplementary to the angle between BE and BC. 

So, if angle between BE and BC is 60°, then angle between BA and BC is 180° - 60° = 120°. 

Wait, but earlier calculation in coordinates said it was 60°. Where is the mistake? 

Let me recalculate the angle between BA and BC in the coordinate system. 

Line BA has slope -1/√3, as calculated before. The tangent line BC is the y-axis (vertical). 

The angle between BA and the y-axis can be calculated as follows: 

The slope of BA is -1/√3, which corresponds to an angle φ with the x-axis, where tanφ = |slope| = 1/√3 → φ = 30°. Since the slope is negative, the line BA is descending from left to right, making 30° below the x-axis. 

The angle between BA and the y-axis is the angle between a line making 30° below x-axis and the y-axis. 

Imagine the y-axis is straight up. The line BA is going down to the right at 30° from the x-axis. The angle between BA and the y-axis is 90° - 30° = 60°, as previously. 

So, this suggests angle ABC is 60°. 

But according to the tangent-chord theorem, the angle between tangent BC and chord BE is 60°, which would be angle EBC. 

But angle EBC is at point B between E and C. Since E is on line AB, and BA is the line extending from B through A, then angle EBC is between BE and BC, while angle ABC is between BA and BC. 

Since E is on line AB, then BE is in the direction from B to E, and BA is in the direction from B to A. If E is on the extension of AB beyond B, then BE is in the direction from B to E (away from A), and BA is in the direction from B to A (opposite of BE). 

Thus, the angle between BE and BC is 60°, and the angle between BA and BC would be 180° - 60° = 120°, if BE and BA are in opposite directions. 

Wait, but in our coordinate system, we had E on the left of B, and BA going from B to A (which would be to the right, since A is on the extension of BE beyond E). Wait, if E is to the left of B, then extending BE beyond E would go further left, so point A would be to the left of E. Thus, line BA goes from B to A, which is to the left, passing through E. So, BE is from B to E (left), and BA is from B to A (further left). So, BA and BE are in the same direction. 

Wait, this changes things. If point A is on the extension of BE beyond E, then BA is from B to A, passing through E. So, BE is a part of BA. Hence, angle between BA and BC is the same as angle between BE and BC, which is 60°. 

This resolves the confusion. Earlier, I incorrectly assumed that A was on the opposite side of BE from B, but in reality, if E is on line AB, then A can be on either side. 

If E is between A and B, then BA is from B to A, passing through E. In this case, BE is a segment from B to E, and BA is from B to A. So, BE is part of BA. Hence, angle between BA and BC is the same as angle between BE and BC, which is 60°. 

Thus, angle ABC is 60°, making the correct answer A. 

But earlier, I thought there was ambiguity, but in reality, since E is on line AB, and arc BE is 120°, the configuration must have E such that BE is a chord of the circle, and line AB passes through B and E. Hence, BA is a line that includes BE. Therefore, angle ABC is formed by BA and BC, and if BC is tangent at B, then angle ABC is 60°. 

Thus, the correct answer should be A. 

But let me cross-verify with another method. 

Using the property that the angle between a tangent and a chord is half the measure of the intercepted arc. Here, the tangent is BC, the chord is BE, so angle EBC is ½ * 120° = 60°. Since E is on line AB, angle EBC is the same as angle ABC, so angle ABC = 60°. 

This confirms it. 

Therefore, the correct answer is A. 60°.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $\angle 9$, we analyze the geometric constraints and their implications:

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Given Constraints**

We are told:

- $ \text{MeasureOf}(Arc(B, E)) = 120^\circ $
- $ \text{PointLiesOnLine}(E, \text{Line}(A, B)) $
- $ \text{PointLiesOnCircle}(B, \text{Circle}(D, r = 3.0)) $
- $ \text{PointLiesOnCircle}(E, \text{Circle}(D, r = 3.0)) $

From this, we deduce:
- Both points $ B $ and $ E $ lie on the same circle centered at $ D $, with radius $ 3.0 $. 
- The arc $ BE $ spans $ 120^\circ $, implying that the **central angle** $ \angle BDE $ is also $ 120^\circ $.
- The line $ AB $ contains both points $ B $ and $ E $, meaning $ E $ lies on the line $ AB $, and thus $ BE $ is a **chord** of the circle.

---

### **Step 2: Interpreting the Target Angle**

We are asked to find $ \angle 9 $, which is equivalent to $ \angle ABC $ — the angle at point $ B $, formed by segments $ BA $ and $ BC $.

To proceed, we consider the **tangent-chord angle theorem**, which states:

> The angle between a tangent and a chord drawn from the point of contact is equal to **half the measure of the intercepted arc**.

In our case, if we assume that line $ BC $ is **tangent** to the circle at point $ B $, then the angle $ \angle EBC $, formed between the chord $ BE $ and the tangent $ BC $, is:

$$
\angle EBC = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{arc } BE = \frac{1}{2} \times 120^\circ = 60^\circ
$$

However, note that the angle $ \angle ABC $ involves the segment $ BA $ instead of $ BE $. Since $ E $ lies on line $ AB $, and $ BE $ is a segment of $ AB $, the angle $ \angle EBC $ is **equal to** $ \angle ABC $, because both involve the same ray $ BC $ and the same line $ AB $.

---

### **Conclusion**

The measure of $ \angle ABC $, which is equal to $ \angle 9 $, is therefore:

$$
\boxed{\angle 9 = 60^\circ}
$$

---

### **Final Answer: A**

$$
\boxed{\text{A}}
