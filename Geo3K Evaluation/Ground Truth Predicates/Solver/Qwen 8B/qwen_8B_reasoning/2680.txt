MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have several points R, B, U, S, T, F, and some angles given. The question is asking for the measure of angle 4, which is denoted as ∠4. Let me start by listing out all the given information so I can visualize it better.

First, the angles:

- Measure of angle at point B between points R and U (Angle(R, B, U)) is 92 degrees.
- Measure of angle at point B between points S and T (Angle(S, B, T)) is 51 degrees.

Then there are some points lying on lines and circles:

- Point F lies on both line RT and line US.
- Points R, T, U, S lie on a circle centered at B with radius 4.0 units. Wait, the problem says "PointLiesOnCircle(R, Circle(B, radius_4_0))", so that means R, T, U, S are all on a circle with center B and radius 4.0. Therefore, B is the center of the circle passing through these four points.

So, B is the center of a circle, and R, T, U, S are points on that circle. Also, F is the intersection of lines RT and US. Since F is on both RT and US, that implies that lines RT and US intersect at point F.

Now, we need to find the measure of angle 4, which is equal to the measure of angle(R, F, U). Wait, the problem states:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(R, F, U)), MeasureOf(Angle(4)))"

So angle RFU is equal to angle 4. So we need to find the measure of angle RFU.

Let me sketch this mentally. There's a circle with center B. Points R, T, U, S are on the circumference. Lines RT and US intersect at F. So, since F is inside the circle? Or outside?

Wait, because if you connect two chords RT and US, their intersection could be inside or outside depending on how they cross. But since all four points are on the circle, then lines RT and US would intersect at some point F. Depending on whether they're secant lines or something else. But since they are connecting two points on the circle each, those lines are chords of the circle. If two chords intersect inside the circle, then their intersection point is inside the circle. However, if they are extended beyond the circle, then maybe outside. But the problem says PointF lies on both lines RT and US, so F could be either inside or outside.

But given that R, T, U, S are on the circle, then lines RT and US are chords. Their intersection F could be inside or outside. Hmm. Let me think about that.

Also, note that angles given at B are 92° and 51°. These are angles at the center of the circle, right? Because B is the center. So angle RBU is 92°, meaning arc RU subtends 92° at the center. Similarly, angle SBT is 51°, so arc ST subtends 5 1° at the center.

Since all points are on the circle with center B, then arcs between them correspond to central angles. Let me recall that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. But here, angles at the center are given directly.

Now, since F is the intersection of RT and US, perhaps we can use properties related to intersecting chords. When two chords intersect inside a circle, the measure of the angle formed is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

Yes! That seems important. So if two chords intersect at point F inside the circle, then the measure of angle RFU is equal to half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the angle and its vertical opposite.

Wait, more precisely, when two chords intersect at a point inside the circle, the measure of the angle is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

So, angle RFU intercepts arcs... Let me see. Let me consider angle at F between points R and U. So angle RFU is formed by chords FR and FU. The intercepted arcs would be arc RU and arc... wait, no. Let me recall the exact theorem.

The formula is: if two chords intersect at a point F inside the circle, then the measure of the angle is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

In this case, angle RFU intercepts arcs RT and SU? Wait, no. Wait, angle at F between R and U. So, the angle RFU intercepts arcs that are opposite. Let me think again.

When two chords intersect at F, forming vertical angles. For example, suppose chords RT and US intersect at F. Then, angle RFU is formed. The intercepted arcs would be arc RU and arc TS. Wait, maybe?

Alternatively, perhaps angle RFU intercepts arcs that are opposite. Let me check with a diagram in mind.

Imagine two chords RT and US intersecting at F. Then, angle RFU is formed. The intercepted arcs would be arc from R to U and arc from T to S? Not sure. Alternatively, the angle is formed by two chords: FR and FU. So, FR connects F to R, and FU connects F to U. So the intercepted arcs would be the arcs that are opposite to the angle. 

Alternatively, according to the intersecting chords angle formula: the measure of angle formed by two chords intersecting at F is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. So angle RFU intercepts arcs RU and TS. Wait, but how?

Let me look up the exact theorem. Well, since I can't actually do that, I'll try to remember. Suppose two chords intersect at F, then the measure of the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. So for angle RFU, the intercepted arcs are arc RU and arc TS. Wait, let me think.

If you have chords RT and US intersecting at F, then angle RFU is formed. The intercepted arcs would be arc RU and arc TS. So angle RFU = ½(arc RU + arc TS).

Therefore, if I can compute arc RU and arc TS, then add them together and divide by 2, that gives me angle RFU, which is equal to angle 4.

So first, let me find arc RU and arc TS.

Given that angle RBU is 92°, which is the central angle for arc RU. Therefore, arc RU measures 92°.

Similarly, angle SBT is 51°, which is the central angle for arc ST. Therefore, arc ST measures 51°.

Therefore, angle RFU = ½(arc RU + arc TS) = ½(92° + 51°) = ½(143°) = 71.5°.

Wait, so angle 4 is 71.5°, which corresponds to option C.

But let me double-check my reasoning here.

First, confirming that angle RFU intercepts arcs RU and TS. Is that correct?

Another way: when two chords intersect inside a circle, the measure of the angle is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. So angle at F is formed by chords FR and FU. Those chords are parts of chords RT and US respectively. So, the intercepted arcs would be arc from R to U (which is arc RU) and arc from T to S (arc TS). Yes, that makes sense. Because the angle is formed by the intersection of chords RT and US. The intercepted arcs are the ones that are opposite the angle. So yes, adding arc RU and arc TS, then dividing by 2.

So with that, angle RFU = ½(arc RU + arc TS) = ½(92° + 51°) = 71.5°, which matches option C.

But let me make sure that there isn't another interpretation. For instance, if angle RFU was formed by different arcs. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the intercepted arcs are arc RT and arc SU? No, that might not be the case. Let me think of a specific example. Suppose I have a circle with center B, points R and U on the circle. Chords RT and US intersect at F. Then, angle RFU is formed. The intercepted arcs would be arc RU and arc TS. Because the angle is formed by two chords: FR and FU. The arc intercepted by angle RFU would be the arc that's opposite, i.e., not containing F. So, arc RU is between R and U, which is one arc, and the other arc would be the arc between T and S. Because the chords RT and US cross, creating two pairs of vertical angles. Each angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. So yes, that seems correct.

So adding 92° and 51° gives 143°, divided by 2 gives 71.5°, so answer C.

Looking back at the answer choices: C is 71.5. So that should be the answer.

Wait, but just to confirm, is there any chance that angle RFU is instead half the difference of arcs? Like, if the angle was formed outside the circle, then it's half the difference. But in this case, since F is inside the circle (because the chords intersect inside), then it's half the sum.

Yes, that's right. So the formula applies here.

Therefore, the measure of angle 4 is 71.5°, which is option C.

I don't see any mistakes in this reasoning. The key steps were recognizing that the angle formed by intersecting chords inside the circle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs, identifying which arcs those are, calculating their measures using the given central angles, and then computing the value. All steps seem logical and consistent with circle theorems.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $\angle 4$, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration based on the constraints provided.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Configuration**

We are told:

- $R, T, U, S$ lie on a circle centered at point $B$, with radius $r = 4.0$. This means $B$ is the **center** of the circle, and the segments $BR, BT, BU,$ and $BS$ are radii.
- The angles at $B$ are given as:
  - $\angle RBU = 92^\circ$
  - $\angle SBT = 51^\circ$
- Point $F$ lies on both lines $RT$ and $US$, implying that these two chords intersect at $F$, which is **inside** the circle.
- We are asked to find the measure of $\angle RFU$, which is defined as $\angle 4$.

---

### **Step 2: Use the Intersecting Chords Theorem**

When two chords intersect inside a circle, the measure of the angle formed is **equal to half the sum** of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

Thus,

$$
\text{Measure of } \angle RFU = \frac{1}{2} (\text{Arc } RU + \text{Arc } TS)
$$

---

### **Step 3: Determine the Measures of the Intercepted Arcs**

From the given angles at the center $B$:

- $\angle RBU = 92^\circ$: This is the central angle subtending arc $RU$, so:
  
  $$
  \text{Arc } RU = 92^\circ
  $$

- $\angle SBT = 51^\circ$: This is the central angle subtending arc $TS$, so:

  $$
  \text{Arc } TS = 51^\circ
  $$

Now plug into the formula:

$$
\angle RFU = \frac{1}{2}(92^\circ + 51^\circ) = \frac{1}{2}(143^\circ) = 71.5^\circ
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

Since $\angle RFU = \angle 4$, the measure of $\angle 4$ is:

$$
\boxed{71.5}
$$

This matches **Option C**.
