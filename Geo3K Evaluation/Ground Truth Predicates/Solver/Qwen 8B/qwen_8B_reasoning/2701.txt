MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a parallelogram WXYZ. The question is asking for the measure of angle XYZ. Let me recall the properties of a parallelogram.

First, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in length. Also, opposite angles are equal. Another important property is that consecutive angles are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. Also, the diagonals bisect each other, but I'm not sure if that's needed here.

The given information includes the lengths of lines YZ and YX. Wait, line YZ would be one side of the parallelogram, right? Since it's a parallelogram WXYZ, the vertices are connected as W-X-Y-Z-W. So the sides are WX, XY, YZ, and ZW. Therefore, Line(Y,Z) is YZ, which is one of the sides. Similarly, Line(Y,X) is YX, which is another side. But wait, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. So if YZ is one side, then WX should be equal to YZ. And XY (which is YX) should be equal to ZW.

But the problem gives LengthOf(Line(Y,Z)) = 28 and LengthOf(Line(Y,X)) = 24. So that means YZ = 28 and YX = 24. Therefore, since opposite sides are equal, WX = YZ = 28, and ZW = YX = 24.

Now, the other given information is MeasureOf(Angle(X, W, Z)) = 105 degrees. Let me parse that. The angle at point W between points X, W, Z. So angle XWZ. Wait, angle at W formed by points X, W, Z. In the parallelogram WXYZ, the vertices are ordered such that the sides are WX, XY, YZ, ZW. So the angle at W is between sides WX and WZ. Wait, but the notation Angle(X, W, Z) refers to the angle at point W between points X, W, Z. So that would be angle XWZ. 

In a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. So angle at W and angle at X are supplementary. Wait, but maybe I need to think about how these angles relate.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So angle at W equals angle at Y, and angle at X equals angle at Z. Also, consecutive angles are supplementary. For example, angle at W plus angle at X equals 180 degrees.

Wait, but the given angle is angle XWZ, which is angle at W. Let me visualize the parallelogram. Let me sketch mentally:

Parallelogram WXYZ has vertices in order W, X, Y, Z. So connecting W to X to Y to Z to W. Then sides are WX, XY, YZ, ZW. Diagonals are WY and XZ.

So angle at W is between sides WX and WZ. So angle XWZ. Given that this angle is 105 degrees. Now, in a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. So angle at W and angle at X are supplementary. So angle at X is 180 - 105 = 75 degrees. Wait, but angle at X is angle WXY?

Wait, maybe I need to clarify the notation. Let me label the parallelogram properly.

Let me consider the vertices in order W, X, Y, Z. So moving around the parallelogram, starting at W, then X, then Y, then Z, back to W. Therefore, the sides are:

- WX: connects W to X
- XY: connects X to Y
- YZ: connects Y to Z
- ZW: connects Z to W

Therefore, angle at vertex X is between sides WX and XY. Similarly, angle at vertex Y is between sides XY and YZ. Angle at vertex Z is between sides YZ and ZW. Angle at vertex W is between sides ZW and WX.

Given that, the angle mentioned is MeasureOf(Angle(X, W, Z)), which is angle at W between points X, W, Z. That would be angle between segments WX and WZ. Which is indeed the angle at W, which is angle XWZ. So that's one of the angles of the parallelogram. Since in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So angle at W equals angle at Y. And consecutive angles are supplementary. So angle at W + angle at X = 180 degrees.

Therefore, if angle at W is 105 degrees, then angle at X is 180 - 105 = 75 degrees. Now, the question asks for m∠XYZ. Let me identify angle XYZ. Point X, Y, Z. So angle at Y between points X, Y, Z. So that's angle at Y, between sides XY and YZ. In the parallelogram, angle at Y is equal to angle at W, because opposite angles are equal. Wait, no. Wait, in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So angle at W equals angle at Y. So if angle at W is 105 degrees, then angle at Y is also 105 degrees. However, angle XYZ is the same as angle at Y. Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure.

Angle XYZ is the angle at point Y, formed by points X, Y, Z. So yes, that's angle at Y. Therefore, if angle at Y is equal to angle at W, which is 105 degrees, then the measure of angle XYZ is 105 degrees. But wait, that would mean the answer is C. But let me check again.

Wait, but there's something conflicting here. Because if angle at W is 105 degrees, then angle at X is 75 degrees. Then angle at Y is equal to angle at W, so 105 degrees. But angle XYZ is angle at Y. So why isn't that 105 degrees? But let me confirm once more.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying which angles are which. Let me think again.

In a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So angle at W and angle at X are supplementary. Similarly, angle at X and angle at Y are supplementary, etc. So if angle at W is 105 degrees, then angle at X is 75 degrees. Then angle at Y is equal to angle at W (since opposite angles are equal), so angle at Y is 105 degrees. Therefore, angle XYZ is angle at Y, so 105 degrees. Hence, the answer is C.

But wait, looking at the answer choices, option C is 105. But let me check again if there's some confusion between different angles.

Wait, could angle XYZ be referring to a different angle? For instance, sometimes in parallelograms, depending on labeling, angles can be confusing. Let me double-check the labeling of the parallelogram.

Assuming the parallelogram is labeled in order W, X, Y, Z. So when you connect them in order, the sides are WX, XY, YZ, ZW. Therefore, the vertices are arranged such that each consecutive pair forms a side.

Thus, angle at Y is formed by sides XY and YZ. So angle XYZ is indeed the angle at Y. Therefore, that angle is equal to angle at W, which is given as 105 degrees. Therefore, the measure of angle XYZ is 105 degrees. Therefore, the answer is C.

But wait, let me cross-validate with another approach. Suppose we use vectors or coordinates. Maybe assign coordinates to the points and calculate the angle.

Let me try that. Let me place point W at the origin (0,0). Let me assume that side WX is along the x-axis. Let me denote the coordinates:

Let’s suppose point W is at (0,0).

Since WX is a side of the parallelogram. Let me assume that the length of WX is equal to YZ, which is given as 28. Wait, earlier we had that YZ = 28, and YX = 24. Wait, YX is the length from Y to X. Wait, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. So YX is equal to ZW. So YX = ZW = 24. And YZ = WX = 28.

So, if we take point W at (0,0), and point X at (a, 0), so that the length of WX is a. Since WX = YZ = 28, so a = 28. So point X is at (28, 0). Now, we need to determine coordinates of Y and Z.

In a parallelogram, vector WX is equal to vector YZ. Vector WX is from W(0,0) to X(28, 0), so the vector is (28, 0). Therefore, vector YZ should also be (28, 0). So if point Z is at some coordinate, then point Y is obtained by adding the vector WX to point Z. Alternatively, since in a parallelogram, the coordinates satisfy W + Y = X + Z. But maybe better to use vectors.

Alternatively, since in a parallelogram, the coordinates can be determined based on vectors. Let me think.

Another way: Let me define point X at (28, 0). Let me assume that the angle at W is 105 degrees. So angle between WX and WZ is 105 degrees. Since WX is along the x-axis from W(0,0) to X(28,0). Then WZ is another side from W(0,0) to Z. The length of WZ is equal to YX, which is 24. So the length of WZ is 24. So point Z is somewhere such that distance from W(0,0) to Z is 24, and the angle between WX (along x-axis) and WZ is 105 degrees. Therefore, coordinates of Z can be found using polar coordinates. If angle is 105 degrees from the x-axis, then coordinates of Z are (24*cos(105°), 24*sin(105°)). 

Once we have coordinates of Z, we can find coordinates of Y. Since in a parallelogram, the vector from X to Y should be equal to the vector from W to Z. Vector WZ is Z - W = (24cos(105°), 24sin(105°)). So vector XY should be same as vector WZ. Since point X is at (28, 0), then point Y is at X + vector WZ. So Y = (28 + 24cos(105°), 0 + 24sin(105°)).

Then, once we have coordinates of Y, we can compute angle XYZ. But maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, since we know that in a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary, and we already reasoned that angle at Y is equal to angle at W, which is 105 degrees. Therefore, angle XYZ is 105 degrees, so answer is C.

But let me check if there's a possibility that angle XYZ is actually the supplement of angle at W. Wait, no. Because in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So angle at W and angle at X are supplementary. Then angle at X and angle at Y are supplementary, etc. So angle at Y is equal to angle at W. Therefore, angle XYZ is angle at Y, which is equal to angle at W, which is 105 degrees. So answer is C.

However, let me verify with the coordinates method. Let me compute coordinates numerically.

First, compute coordinates of Z:

Angle between WX (x-axis) and WZ is 105 degrees. So direction of WZ is 105 degrees from positive x-axis. So cos(105°) and sin(105°):

cos(105°) ≈ cos(60°+45°) = cos60cos45 - sin60sin45 = (0.5)(√2/2) - (√3/2)(√2/2) ≈ (0.5 * 0.7071) - (0.8660 * 0.7071) ≈ 0.3536 - 0.6124 ≈ -0.2588.

Similarly, sin(105°) = sin(60°+45°) = sin60cos45 + cos60sin45 ≈ (0.8660 * 0.7071) + (0.5 * 0.7071) ≈ 0.6124 + 0.3536 ≈ 0.9660.

So coordinates of Z are approximately (24 * (-0.2588), 24 * 0.9660) ≈ (-6.211, 23.184).

Then vector WZ is (-6.211, 23.184). Therefore, vector XY must be same as vector WZ. Since point X is at (28, 0), then point Y is at X + vector WZ: (28 - 6.211, 0 + 23.184) ≈ (21.789, 23.184).

Now, coordinates:

Point Y is approximately (21.789, 23.184).

Point X is (28, 0).

Point Z is (-6.211, 23.184).

We need to find angle XYZ, which is angle at Y between points X, Y, Z.

To find angle at Y, we can compute vectors YX and YZ, then find the angle between them.

Vector YX is X - Y: (28 - 21.789, 0 - 23.184) ≈ (6.211, -23.184).

Vector YZ is Z - Y: (-6.211 - 21.789, 23.184 - 23.184) ≈ (-28, 0).

So vector YX is approximately (6.211, -23.184), and vector YZ is (-28, 0).

Compute the angle between these two vectors.

Using the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (v ⋅ w)/(|v| |w|)

First, compute v ⋅ w:

(6.211)(-28) + (-23.184)(0) = -6.211*28 ≈ -173.908.

|v| is sqrt(6.211² + (-23.184)^2). Let's compute:

6.211^2 ≈ 38.58

(-23.184)^2 ≈ 537.3

Total ≈ 38.58 + 537.3 ≈ 575.88 → sqrt(575.88) ≈ 23.997 ≈ 24. Which makes sense because YX was supposed to be length 24. Indeed, since YX is the same as ZW, which was given as 24.

|w| is sqrt((-28)^2 + 0^2) = 28.

So cos(theta) ≈ -173.908 / (24 * 28) ≈ -173.908 / 672 ≈ -0.2588.

Therefore theta ≈ arccos(-0.2588). What is arccos(-0.2588)? Well, cos(105°) is approximately cos(π - 75°) = -cos(75°) ≈ -0.2588. So theta ≈ 105°, which matches our previous conclusion. Thus, the measure of angle XYZ is indeed 105 degrees, confirming that answer is C.

Wait, but the problem says "Use parallelogram W X Y Z". So the labels might be different. Let me just ensure that angle XYZ is indeed the angle at Y. Yes, since it's angle at Y between X, Y, Z. So that's consistent with our calculation.

So according to both the properties of parallelograms and the coordinate calculation, angle XYZ measures 105 degrees, which corresponds to answer choice C. Therefore, the correct answer is C.
