MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points W and N that lie on a circle centered at point I. The triangle IWN is equilateral, and the length of WN is 5. We need to find the measure of angle W N, which I think is the arc WN on the circle. Wait, maybe it's the central angle? Let me make sure.

First, since both W and N are on the circle with center I, that means IW and IN are radii of the circle. Also, triangle IWN is equilateral. If the triangle is equilateral, then all sides are equal. So IW = WN = IN. But wait, WN is given as 5. Therefore, all sides of the triangle are 5. That would mean the radius of the circle is 5 because IW and IN are radii. 

So, the circle has radius 5. Now, the question asks for the measure of angle W N. Hmm, maybe that's the central angle subtended by arc WN. Since the triangle IWN is equilateral, each angle in the triangle is 60 degrees. Wait, but angle at I is part of the triangle. In triangle IWN, angle at I is 60 degrees because it's equilateral. But angle at I is the central angle between points W and N. Therefore, the measure of arc WN should be equal to the central angle, which is 60 degrees. However, the answer choices are in terms of pi, so converting 60 degrees to radians would be π/3. But none of the answer choices directly say π/3. Let me check again.

Wait, the problem says "Find ∠WN". Maybe there's a typo here? Or perhaps it's referring to the arc measure? Let me read again. The original question says "Find ∠WN if △IWN is equilateral..." Wait, maybe the notation ∠WN refers to the angle at point N? No, usually angles are denoted with three points, like ∠WN... Wait, maybe the question meant ∠WIN? Or maybe it's supposed to be the arc measure?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the measure of the arc WN in radians. Since the central angle is 60 degrees, which is π/3 radians. But looking at the answer choices:

A. (3/5)π ≈ 1.884 rad

B. (5/3)π ≈ 5.236 rad

C. 5π ≈ 15.7 rad

D. 10π ≈ 31.4 rad

But π/3 is approximately 1.047 rad, which isn't listed. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the problem.

Given that triangle IWN is equilateral, so all sides are equal. So IW = IN = WN = 5. Since I is the center of the circle, IW and IN are radii, meaning the radius r = 5. Then, the central angle between points W and N is the angle at I, which is 60 degrees because the triangle is equilateral. So the arc WN measures 60 degrees, which is π/3 radians. But none of the answer choices are π/3. Wait, unless there's something wrong in my reasoning.

Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the inscribed angle instead of the central angle? For example, if there was another point, but no, the question just mentions points W and N on the circle. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the angle at point N or W?

Wait, let me parse the question again: Find ∠WN. That notation might be ambiguous. Typically, ∠ABC denotes the angle at point B. But if it's written as ∠WN, that could be confusing. Maybe there's a missing letter? Like ∠WNI or ∠WN... Maybe it's a typo and they meant ∠WIN? Or maybe the angle at N? Wait, the problem statement might have been misformatted. Alternatively, maybe it's referring to the arc measure. Let me consider that possibility.

If the problem is asking for the measure of arc WN, then since the central angle is 60 degrees, the arc measure is also 60 degrees, which is π/3 radians. Still not matching the answer choices. But the answer choices don't include π/3. Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, maybe the triangle being equilateral implies more than just the central angle. Let me draw it mentally. Points W and N are on the circle with center I. Triangle IWN is equilateral. So IW = IN = WN = 5. So the distance between W and N is 5, which is also the radius. Wait, but in a circle, the chord length between two points is related to the central angle. The formula for chord length is 2r sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle. Here, chord length WN is 5, and r is 5. So substituting into the formula:

Chord length = 2 * r * sin(θ / 2)

So,

5 = 2 * 5 * sin(θ / 2)

Divide both sides by 5:

1 = 2 sin(θ / 2)

sin(θ / 2) = 1/2

Therefore θ / 2 = π/6 (since sine of π/6 is 1/2). Thus θ = π/3 radians, which is 60 degrees. So the central angle is π/3 radians. Therefore, the measure of arc WN is π/3 radians. But again, answer choices don't have π/3. Let me check the answer choices again:

A. 3/5 π ≈ 1.884 rad

B. 5/3 π ≈ 5.236 rad

C. 5π ≈ 15.7 rad

D. 10π ≈ 31.4 rad

None of these are π/3. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the question. Maybe it's not the central angle but something else?

Wait, the problem states that triangle IWN is equilateral. So angle at I is 60 degrees. But maybe the question is asking for the measure of angle at N or W? Let me see. If the triangle is equilateral, all angles are 60 degrees. So ∠INW or ∠IWN would be 60 degrees. But again, how does that relate to the answer choices?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the circumference? No, that doesn't fit. Or area? Not likely. Wait, the answer choices are all multiples of π. So if the arc measure is π/3, but answer choices don't have that. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem setup.

Wait, going back to the problem statement: PointLiesOnCircle(W, Circle(I, radius_0_0)) and same for N. So both W and N are on the circle with center I. So I is the center. Then triangle IWN is equilateral. So IW = IN = WN. Since IW and IN are radii, so their lengths are equal to the radius. Therefore, WN equals the radius. So radius is 5. Hence, the circle has radius 5. Now, the chord length between W and N is 5, which is equal to the radius. As before, using chord length formula:

chord length = 2r sin(theta/2) => 5 = 2*5*sin(theta/2) => sin(theta/2)=0.5 => theta= π/3 radians. So arc measure is π/3. But the answer choices do not include π/3. Wait, but answer choices are A to D. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem or answer choices?

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the angle in degrees? But the answer choices are in terms of π. Wait, if it's asking for the angle in radians, π/3 is approximately 1.047. None of the answer choices match. But maybe I messed up the chord length calculation?

Let me redo the chord length formula. Chord length c = 2r sin(θ/2). Given c=5, r=5. So:

5 = 2*5*sin(θ/2) → divide both sides by 5: 1 = 2 sin(θ/2) → sin(θ/2) = 1/2 → θ/2 = π/6 → θ = π/3. Correct. So the central angle is π/3 radians. So the arc measure is π/3. But answer choices don't have that. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the measure of the angle at point N or W?

In triangle IWN, which is equilateral, so all angles are 60 degrees. So ∠INW is 60 degrees. But if the question is asking for that, then converting to radians is π/3. Still same issue. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the central angle but the inscribed angle? Suppose there is another point, but the problem only mentions points W, N, and I. Unless there's some other construction. Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the measure of ∠WN in terms of the arc? Wait, maybe it's referring to the arc WN, which is π/3 radians. But none of the answer choices match. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the measure of the angle subtended by arc WN at the circumference? Which would be half the central angle. So π/6, but that's even smaller. Still not matching the answer choices. 

Wait, let me check the answer choices again. Option A is (3/5)π, which is 1.884 rad. Option B is (5/3)π ≈ 5.236 rad. Option C is 5π ≈ 15.7 rad. Option D is 10π ≈ 31.4 rad. 

Hmm. Wait, maybe the problem is not about the central angle but about the entire circle? For example, if the arc WN is π/3, then the total circumference is 2πr = 10π. But that's option D. But why would they ask for that? 

Alternatively, maybe the problem had a different configuration. For example, if the triangle IWN is equilateral, but I is not the center? Wait, no. Because the problem says that W and N are on the circle with center I. So I must be the center. Therefore, IW and IN are radii. Hence, triangle IWN has sides IW=IN=r and WN=5. So r=5. 

Wait, but if triangle IWN is equilateral, then all sides are equal. So WN = IW = IN. So IW = IN = 5, hence radius is 5. Then, the chord length WN is 5, which matches. So the central angle is π/3. 

But none of the answer choices match. This suggests either a mistake in the problem or answer choices. But assuming that there's a mistake in my understanding, let me think differently. 

Wait, maybe the problem is not in radians? If the answer is expected in degrees, but the options are in terms of π. For example, π/3 radians is 60 degrees. If the question asked for degrees, but answer choices are in terms of π, that doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the length of the arc WN? Arc length is rθ, which would be 5*(π/3) = 5π/3. Oh! That's option B: (5/3)π. Wait, 5π/3 is indeed option B. 

Ah! I think I confused between the measure of the arc (which is π/3 radians) and the arc length. The problem says "Find ∠WN", but maybe it's a mistranslation or misprint, and actually refers to the arc length. Or maybe the measure of the arc in radians. Wait, arc measure is typically expressed in degrees or radians. If they're asking for the measure of arc WN, which is π/3 radians. But if they want the arc length, it would be r * θ = 5*(π/3) = 5π/3, which is option B. 

So maybe the question intended to ask for the arc length instead of the central angle measure. Given that, the answer would be 5π/3, which is option B. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the central angle in terms of π, which is π/3. But that's not among the options. But if you multiply by something... Wait, maybe there's a miscalculation. Let me check again.

Wait, if the central angle is π/3, then the arc length is rθ = 5*(π/3) = 5π/3. So that's option B. If the question is asking for arc length, then B is the answer. However, the problem says "Find ∠WN". If ∠WN is meant to represent the arc measure, then the answer would be π/3, but that's not an option. But if it's asking for arc length, then B is correct. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem's phrasing. Since the user wrote "Find ∠WN", which is unclear. It could be a typo for "arc WN" or "angle at N". But if it's angle at N, then in triangle IWN, which is equilateral, all angles are 60 degrees. Converting to radians is π/3. Again, same issue. 

But considering that answer choice B is 5π/3, which is the arc length, and that seems plausible, maybe the question intended to ask for arc length. Given that, I'll go with option B as the answer.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine $\widehat{WN}$, we first interpret the geometric setup based on the given information:

- Points $W$ and $N$ lie on a circle centered at point $I$, indicating that segments $IW$ and $IN$ are radii of the circle.
- Triangle $IWN$ is **equilateral**, implying that all its sides are equal: $IW = IN = WN$.
- The side $WN$ is explicitly given as 5 units, so the radius $r = 5$.
- The angle $\angle WIN$ is the central angle corresponding to arc $WN$, and since the triangle is equilateral, all internal angles are $60^\circ$. Therefore, $\angle WIN = 60^\circ$.

---

### Step-by-Step Derivation:

#### 1. **Central Angle and Arc Measure**  
Since $\triangle IWN$ is equilateral, the angle at vertex $I$ ($\angle WIN$) is $60^\circ$. In a circle, the measure of the arc intercepted by a central angle is numerically equal to the angle in radians.  

Convert $60^\circ$ to radians:  
$$
\theta = 60^\circ = \frac{\pi}{3} \text{ radians}
$$

Thus, the **measure of arc $WN$** is $\frac{\pi}{3}$.

However, the problem asks us to find $\widehat{WN}$, which can be interpreted as the **length of arc $WN$** rather than its degree/radian measure. To compute the arc length:

$$
\text{Arc Length} = r \cdot \theta = 5 \cdot \frac{\pi}{3} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
$$

This corresponds to **option B**: $\boxed{\frac{5}{3}\pi}$

### Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\text{B}}
