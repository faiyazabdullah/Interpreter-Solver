MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So we have quadrilateral WXYZ inscribed in circle V, which means it's a cyclic quadrilateral. The points Y, Z, W, and X all lie on a circle with center V and radius 3.0. 

The given angles are angle at Y (Angle(Y,Z,W)) measures 60 degrees, and angle at Z (Angle(Z,W,X)) measures 95 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle X, which I assume is angle at point X, so Angle(X,Y,Z)? Wait, no. Wait, the question says "Find m∠X". In quadrilaterals, the notation ∠X usually refers to the angle at vertex X. But since it's a quadrilateral WXYZ, the vertices are in order W, X, Y, Z? Or maybe another order? Wait, quadrilateral WXYZ would typically have vertices connected as W-X-Y-Z-W. But depending on how they're arranged on the circle, the order might affect the angles. However, since it's inscribed in a circle, the order matters for cyclic quadrilaterals.

But first, let me recall that in a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles are supplementary. That is, the sum of each pair of opposite angles is 180 degrees. But wait, but here we only know two angles. Let me check again. The given angles are:

- Measure of angle at Y (Y, Z, W) is 60°. So that's angle at Y between points Z and W. So in terms of the quadrilateral, if the quadrilateral is W, X, Y, Z, then the angle at Y would be between X and Z? Wait, perhaps I need to clarify the structure.

Wait, the quadrilateral is WXYZ. So the order of the vertices is important. If you go around the circle, the quadrilateral is W connected to X connected to Y connected to Z connected back to W. Therefore, the angles of the quadrilateral are at each vertex: angle at W, angle at X, angle at Y, angle at Z. Wait, but the given angles are angle(Y,Z,W) = 60°, which would be the angle at Y between points Z and W. Similarly, angle(Z,W,X) is the angle at W between points Z and X. Wait, hold on. Let me parse that.

In standard angle notation, Angle(A,B,C) is the angle at point B, formed by points A-B-C. So:

- Angle(Y, Z, W) is the angle at Z between points Y and W. Wait, no! Wait, the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(Y, Z, W) is the angle at Z, with segments ZY and ZW. So that's angle at Z between Y and W. Wait, but that seems conflicting with the quadrilateral. Wait, but the quadrilateral is W, X, Y, Z. So the vertices are W, X, Y, Z. So the sides would be WX, XY, YZ, and ZW. Then the angles at each vertex:

At W: between Z and X (since adjacent sides are ZW and WX)

At X: between W and Y

At Y: between X and Z

At Z: between Y and W

Wait, but the given angles are:

Measure of Angle(Y, Z, W) = 60°, which would be the angle at Z between Y and W. That is, angle at Z between Y and W. Which would be the internal angle at Z of the quadrilateral. Similarly, Measure of Angle(Z, W, X) = 95°, which is angle at W between Z and X. That's the internal angle at W of the quadrilateral.

So, given that, the angles at Z and W are known: angle at Z is 60°, angle at W is 95°. And we need to find angle at X. Since it's a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of opposite angles is 180°. So angle at W + angle at Y = 180°, and angle at X + angle at Z = 180°. Wait, but we don't know angle at Y yet. Alternatively, maybe there's another way.

Alternatively, since the quadrilateral is cyclic, we can use the property that the sum of all interior angles is 360°. So angle W + angle X + angle Y + angle Z = 360°. But we only know angle W (which is 95°), angle Z (which is 60°). So if we could find angle Y, then we can compute angle X. But how?

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the exterior angle is equal to the interior opposite angle. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Wait, let me think again about the given angles.

Wait, angle at Z is 60°, angle at W is 95°. So if we denote the angles as follows:

Let me define the angles:

- At vertex W: angle is 95° (given by Angle(Z, W, X) = 95°)
- At vertex Z: angle is 60° (given by Angle(Y, Z, W) = 60°)
- Need to find angle at X (let's call it angle X)
- Also need to find angle at Y (call it angle Y)

Since total sum is 360°, so:

angle W + angle X + angle Y + angle Z = 360°
=> 95 + angle X + angle Y + 60 = 360
=> angle X + angle Y = 360 - 95 - 60 = 360 - 155 = 205°

So angle X + angle Y = 205°. But how do we find angle Y or angle X?

Alternatively, since it's cyclic, opposite angles are supplementary. So angle W + angle Y = 180°, and angle X + angle Z = 180°. Wait, is that true? Yes, in a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles are supplementary. So:

Opposite angles: angle W and angle Y are opposite? Wait, depends on the order of the quadrilateral. Let me confirm the order of the quadrilateral.

If the quadrilateral is W, X, Y, Z, then the opposite angles would be angle W and angle Y, and angle X and angle Z. Because connecting W to X to Y to Z to W. So opposite angles are W and Y, X and Z.

Therefore, according to cyclic quadrilateral properties:

angle W + angle Y = 180°, and angle X + angle Z = 180°.

Given that angle W is 95°, so angle Y = 180° - 95° = 85°.

Similarly, angle Z is 60°, so angle X = 180° - 60° = 120°.

Wait, that would mean angle X is 120°, which is option D. But let me verify this because sometimes the order of the quadrilateral might not be straightforward.

Wait, but if angle Z is part of the quadrilateral, then angle Z is at vertex Z. So if the quadrilateral is W, X, Y, Z, then the opposite of angle Z would be angle X. Hence angle X + angle Z = 180°, so angle X = 180° - 60° = 120°, so answer D. But let me check again.

But wait, the given angle at Z is 60°, which is angle between Y and W. So yes, angle at Z is 60°, so angle Z is 60°, so angle X should be 180 - 60 = 120°, making answer D. However, let me make sure that the quadrilateral is indeed ordered such that angle Z is opposite angle X.

Wait, the quadrilateral is WXYZ. So vertices are W, X, Y, Z connected in order. So edges are W to X, X to Y, Y to Z, Z to W. Therefore, the opposite angles would be angle at W and angle at Y; angle at X and angle at Z. So angle at Z is opposite angle at X. Therefore, angle X + angle Z = 180°, so angle X = 180° - 60° = 120°, which is option D.

But let me cross-validate with the other approach. Earlier, we had angle X + angle Y = 205°. If angle Y is 85°, then angle X would be 205 - 85 = 120°, same result. So both methods agree. Thus, the answer should be 120°, which is option D.

But let me check if there's something wrong with assuming that angle Z is 60°, as per the given information. Wait, the given angle was Angle(Y, Z, W) = 60°, which is the angle at Z between Y and W. So that is indeed the internal angle at vertex Z of the quadrilateral. So yes, angle Z is 60°, hence angle X is 120°.

Alternatively, could there be an error in interpreting the angle notation? For example, if the angle was external or something else? Let me re-examine the notation.

Angle(Y, Z, W) is the angle at point Z, between points Y and W. So yes, that is the internal angle at Z. So that's correct.

Hence, the measure of angle X is 120°, so answer D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $ \angle X $ in quadrilateral $ WXYZ $, we start by analyzing the given information:

### Given Information:
1. **Quadrilateral** $ WXYZ $ is **inscribed** in circle $ \odot V $. This implies it is a **cyclic quadrilateral**.
2. **Angles specified:**
   - $ \angle YZW = 60^\circ $
   - $ \angle ZWX = 95^\circ $

These correspond to:
- $ \angle Z = 60^\circ $ (internal angle at vertex $ Z $)
- $ \angle W = 95^\circ $ (internal angle at vertex $ W $)

We are asked to find the measure of $ \angle X $.

---

### Step 1: Use the Property of Cyclic Quadrilaterals

For a **cyclic quadrilateral**, the following key property holds:
> **Opposite angles are supplementary**:  
> $$
\angle A + \angle C = 180^\circ, \quad \text{and} \quad \angle B + \angle D = 180^\circ
$$

Here, the vertices are in the order $ W \rightarrow X \rightarrow Y \rightarrow Z \rightarrow W $, forming a closed shape. Therefore, the **opposite angles** are:
- $ \angle W $ and $ \angle Y $
- $ \angle X $ and $ \angle Z $

Thus,
$$
\angle X + \angle Z = 180^\circ
$$

Substitute the known value of $ \angle Z = 60^\circ $:
$$
\angle X + 60^\circ = 180^\circ \\
\Rightarrow \angle X = 120^\circ
$$

---

### Final Verification

As an additional check, the sum of all interior angles in any quadrilateral is always:
$$
\angle W + \angle X + \angle Y + \angle Z = 360^\circ
$$

From earlier, we used the cyclic property to deduce:
- $ \angle W = 95^\circ $
- $ \angle Z = 60^\circ $
- $ \angle X = 120^\circ $
- $ \angle Y = 180^\circ - \angle W = 85^\circ $

Now, verify the total:
$$
95^\circ + 120^\circ + 85^\circ + 60^\circ = 360^\circ
$$
This confirms our solution is consistent.
