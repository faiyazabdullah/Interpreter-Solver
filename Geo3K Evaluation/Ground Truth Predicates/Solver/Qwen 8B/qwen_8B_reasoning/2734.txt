MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have some angle measures and points that lie on lines. Let me start by breaking down the given information.

First, the problem says that the measure of angle CDA is equal to x. So, angle at point D between points C, D, A. Then there's a condition that point D lies on line AB. Wait, so D is somewhere on the line connecting A and B? That might mean that D is colinear with A and B, but I need to visualize this.

Next, it states that the measure of angle BDC equals the measure of angle ABC. Also, angle BDC is equal to angle DCB. Hmm, so angle BDC = angle DCB. Wait, angle DCB would be the angle at point C between points D, C, B. So angle DCB is the same as angle BCD? Maybe I should draw a diagram mentally.

Let me try to sketch this out. Points A, B, C, D. Point D is on line AB. So maybe the points are arranged like A---D---B, with C being another point connected somehow. But then angles involving C. Let me think.

Given that angle BDC equals angle ABC and also angle DCB. Wait, angle BDC is at D, between B, D, C. Angle DCB is at C, between D, C, B. So those two angles are equal. If two angles in triangle BDC are equal, then the triangle is isosceles. Because in a triangle, equal angles correspond to equal opposite sides.

So triangle BDC has angles at D and C equal. Therefore, BD = BC. Wait, because in triangle BDC, angle at D equals angle at C, so sides opposite those angles are equal. The side opposite angle D is BC, and the side opposite angle C is BD. Therefore, BC = BD. So BD = BC.

Also, angle ABC is equal to angle BDC. Let me note that angle ABC is at point B between points A, B, C. And angle BDC is at D between B, D, C. So maybe there's some relationship here.

Since D lies on AB, perhaps AD + DB = AB. But I don't know the lengths yet. However, since BD = BC (from earlier), maybe we can find relations between triangles.

Also, angle CDA is x. Let me consider triangle ADC. In triangle ADC, angle at D is x. But I need more info about the triangle. Wait, but maybe considering other triangles.

Wait, let's see. Since D is on AB, maybe we can look at triangle ABC and triangle DBC? Or something else.

Alternatively, maybe using vertical angles or other properties. Let me think again.

We have angle BDC = angle ABC. Let me denote angle ABC as y. Then angle BDC is also y. Also, angle DCB is y, as per the third equality. So in triangle BDC, angles at D and C are both y. Therefore, the third angle at B is 180 - 2y. Wait, but angle at B in triangle BDC is angle DBC. Wait, no. Triangle BDC has vertices B, D, C. The angles are:

At D: angle BDC = y,

At C: angle DCB = y,

Therefore, angle at B in triangle BDC is angle DBC = 180 - y - y = 180 - 2y.

But angle ABC is also y. Wait, angle ABC is part of triangle ABC. Let me think. Point D is on AB, so angle ABC is the angle at point B between points A, B, C. But angle DBC is part of that angle. Wait, if D is on AB, then BD is a segment from B to D on AB. So angle DBC is actually the same as angle ABC? No, wait. If D is on AB, then BD is just a segment extending from B towards A. Wait, depends on whether D is between A and B or extended beyond. The problem says "PointLiesOnLine(D, Line(A,B))", which means D could be anywhere along the line AB, including between A and B or outside.

Assuming D is between A and B for simplicity. Then angle ABC is formed by BA and BC. But angle DBC would be formed by BD and BC. Since BD is part of BA, then angle DBC is the same as angle ABC. Wait, no. If D is between A and B, then BD is going from B to D, which is towards A. So BA is going from B to A, and BD is from B to D (which is closer to A). So angle between BD and BC would be the same as angle between BA and BC, which is angle ABC. Therefore, angle DBC = angle ABC = y. But earlier, in triangle BDC, angle DBC was calculated as 180 - 2y. So setting them equal:

angle DBC = angle ABC = y = 180 - 2y => y = 180 - 2y => 3y = 180 => y = 60 degrees. Therefore, angle ABC is 60 degrees, which is also angle BDC and angle DCB.

So now, knowing that, let's try to find x, which is angle CDA. Let me consider triangle ADC. In triangle ADC, we have angle at D is x, angle at C? Wait, need to figure out other angles.

Wait, let me check the points again. Let me imagine points A and B with D on AB. Then point C is connected such that angles involving C are considered. From earlier, we had BD = BC (since triangle BDC is isosceles with BD=BC).

So BC = BD. Also, since D is on AB, BD is part of AB. Let me denote AB as a straight line with D between A and B. So AB = AD + DB. Since BD = BC, let me assign variables. Let me suppose AB has length, say, arbitrary. Let me assume coordinates to make it easier?

Alternatively, maybe use triangle ABC. Let me think. If BC = BD, and BD is part of AB, then AB = AD + BD = AD + BC. Not sure yet.

Looking back at angle CDA, which is angle at D between C, D, A. So in triangle ADC, angle at D is x. What other angles can we determine?

In triangle ADC, angles sum to 180. So angle at D (x) plus angle at A plus angle at C equals 180. But I need to find expressions for these angles.

Wait, maybe looking at other parts. Let's consider triangle ABC. We know angle at B is y = 60 degrees. If we can find other angles in triangle ABC, maybe we can relate them.

But without knowing more about the triangle, maybe we need to relate it through other relationships. Alternatively, since BD = BC, triangle BDC is isosceles with BD = BC. So BC = BD, meaning that BC is equal in length to BD. So if I consider triangle ABC, BC is one of its sides. And BD is part of AB.

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle ADC. Let me think. Let me try to find angle at A or angle at C in triangle ADC.

Wait, angle at C in triangle ADC is angle ACD. How can I find that?

Angle ACD is adjacent to angle DCB, which is y = 60 degrees. Because angle DCB is part of angle ACB in triangle ABC. Wait, if point D is on AB, then line CD connects to point C. So angle ACB is split into angle ACD and angle DCB. Wait, angle DCB is y = 60 degrees, so angle ACB = angle ACD + angle DCB = angle ACD + 60 degrees.

If I can find angle ACB, then I can find angle ACD. Then, in triangle ADC, angles at A, D, C are known except for x.

But how do I find angle ACB?

In triangle ABC, angles sum to 180. We know angle at B is 60 degrees. If I can find either angle at A or angle at C, then I can compute the remaining.

But how?

Wait, maybe considering triangle ADC and triangle ABC. Let me think. Let me try to express angle at A.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that BD = BC. Let me consider triangle ABC and triangle DBC. Since BD = BC, and if we can find other sides or angles.

Alternatively, since BD = BC, maybe triangle BDC is isosceles with BD = BC, so angles at D and C are equal (which they are, both y=60 degrees). So that gives us that angle at D is 60 degrees, angle at C is 60 degrees, making angle at B in triangle BDC equal to 60 degrees as well? Wait, earlier calculation said angle DBC = 180 - 2y, which when y=60, becomes 180-120=60. So triangle BDC is equilateral? All angles 60 degrees. So BD = BC = DC. So triangle BDC is equilateral.

Wait, if triangle BDC has all angles equal to 60 degrees, then yes, it's an equilateral triangle. Therefore, BD = BC = DC.

So DC = BC. So DC = BC. Which implies that triangle DBC is equilateral. Therefore, DC = BC. So point C is positioned such that DC equals BC. So from point D, drawing a line to C, forming an equilateral triangle with B.

Now, considering triangle ADC. We need to find angle at D, which is x. Let me think about triangle ADC. Points A, D, C. We know DC = BC. Also, BD = BC, so BD = DC. Therefore, BD = DC. So BD = DC. So triangle BDC is equilateral, so DC = BD = BC.

Therefore, DC = BD. So from point D, DC is equal to BD. So if we consider triangle ADC, we have DC = BD. But BD is part of AB. So if I can relate AD to BD?

Wait, since D is on AB, AB = AD + DB. But BD = DC, so AB = AD + DC.

But how does that help?

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle ADC. In triangle ADC, sides are AD, DC, and AC. We know DC = BD. But unless we know AD or AC, it's hard to proceed. Unless there's another relation.

Alternatively, think about angles. In triangle ADC, angle at D is x. Let me try to find other angles.

Earlier, we noted that angle ACB = angle ACD + angle DCB. We know angle DCB is 60 degrees. So angle ACB = angle ACD + 60. Now, in triangle ABC, angles sum to 180. So angle at A + angle at B + angle at C = 180. Angle at B is 60 degrees, angle at C is angle ACB = angle ACD + 60. So angle at A + 60 + (angle ACD + 60) = 180. Simplifying, angle at A + angle ACD + 120 = 180 → angle at A + angle ACD = 60 degrees.

But angle at A in triangle ABC is angle BAC. In triangle ADC, angle at A is angle CAD. Are these the same? Yes, because angle BAC is the same as angle CAD if D is on AB. Wait, no. If D is on AB, then angle BAC is the angle at A between BA and CA. While angle CAD is the angle at A between CA and DA. Since DA is part of BA, angle BAC and angle CAD are supplementary? Wait, no. Because if you have point D on AB, then from point A, the line AD is part of AB. So angle between CA and AD is angle CAD, and angle between BA and CA is angle BAC. Since AD is part of BA, depending on the position of D, angle BAC and angle CAD may add up to something.

Wait, suppose D is between A and B. Then from point A, the direction to D is along AB towards B. So angle between CA and AD (angle CAD) is part of angle BAC. Because angle BAC is between BA and CA. Since AD is along BA, angle CAD is the same as angle BAC. Wait, no. Let me clarify:

Imagine standing at point A. The line AB goes from A to B, and D is a point on AB. So from A, the direction to D is towards B. The angle BAC is between BA (which is the reverse of AB) and CA. So if you're at A, BA is pointing away from B, and CA is pointing to C. So angle BAC is between BA and CA. Whereas angle CAD is between CA and DA. Since DA is along AB towards D (which is towards B), then angle CAD is the same as angle BAC. Because DA is in the same direction as BA (but from A's perspective, BA is the direction from B to A, while DA is from A to D, which is towards B). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Let me think again. At point A, the lines involved are AB (going from A to B) and AC (going from A to C). The angle BAC is between AB and AC. If D is a point on AB, then AD is a segment of AB. So the angle between AD and AC is the same as angle BAC. Because AD is along AB. Therefore, angle CAD is equal to angle BAC. Therefore, angle at A in triangle ABC is equal to angle at A in triangle ADC. 

So in triangle ADC, angles are:

At D: x,

At A: angle BAC,

At C: angle ACD.

And their sum is 180 degrees. So:

x + angle BAC + angle ACD = 180.

Earlier, we had from triangle ABC:

angle BAC + angle ACD = 60 degrees.

Therefore, substituting into the equation above:

x + 60 = 180 ⇒ x = 120 degrees.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So x is 120 degrees. Looking at the answer choices, option D is 120. So the answer would be D.

But let me verify once more to ensure there are no mistakes.

So steps:

1. Given angle BDC = angle ABC = y, and angle DCB = y, leading to triangle BDC having angles y, y, and 180 - 2y at B. Equating angle DBC (which is same as angle ABC) to 180 - 2y, solving gives y = 60 degrees.

2. Thus, triangle BDC is equilateral, so BD = BC = DC.

3. In triangle ABC, angle at B is 60 degrees. Angle ACB = angle ACD + 60 degrees.

4. In triangle ABC, angles sum to 180, so angle BAC + 60 + (angle ACD + 60) = 180 ⇒ angle BAC + angle ACD = 60 degrees.

5. In triangle ADC, angles are x (at D), angle BAC (at A), and angle ACD (at C). Their sum is 180. So x + (angle BAC + angle ACD) = 180 ⇒ x + 60 = 180 ⇒ x = 120.

Yes, that seems consistent. Therefore, x is 120 degrees. So the answer is D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, which represents the measure of angle $ \angle CDA $, we carefully analyze the geometric constraints and apply logical deductions based on triangle properties and angle relationships.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Setup**

From the given conditions:
- Point $ D $ lies on line $ AB $, i.e., $ D \in \text{Line}(A, B) $
- $ \angle BDC = \angle ABC $
- $ \angle BDC = \angle DCB $

This tells us that triangle $ \triangle BDC $ has two equal angles at $ D $ and $ C $, implying that the triangle is **isosceles** with base $ BC $. Furthermore, the equality of these two angles suggests that triangle $ \triangle BDC $ is **equilateral**, since all three internal angles are equal.

Thus,
$$
\angle BDC = \angle DCB = \angle DBC = 60^\circ
$$

---

### **Step 2: Analyze Triangle $ \triangle ABC $ and $ \triangle ADC $**

#### **Triangle $ \triangle BDC $**
As shown, all angles are $ 60^\circ $, hence triangle $ \triangle BDC $ is equilateral. This means:
$$
BD = BC = DC
$$

#### **Triangle $ \triangle ABC $**
- $ \angle ABC = 60^\circ $ (as established above)
- The total interior angles of triangle $ \triangle ABC $ must sum to $ 180^\circ $, so:
$$
\angle BAC + \angle ABC + \angle ACB = 180^\circ
$$
Substitute $ \angle ABC = 60^\circ $:
$$
\angle BAC + \angle ACB = 120^\circ \tag{1}
$$

Note that $ \angle ACB $ can be broken into two parts:
$$
\angle ACB = \angle ACD + \angle DCB = \angle ACD + 60^\circ
$$
Substituting into Equation (1):
$$
\angle BAC + (\angle ACD + 60^\circ) = 120^\circ \Rightarrow \angle BAC + \angle ACD = 60^\circ \tag{2}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Consider Triangle $ \triangle ADC $**

In triangle $ \triangle ADC $, the three angles are:
- $ \angle CDA = x $
- $ \angle DAC = \angle BAC $ (same as angle at $ A $)
- $ \angle ACD $ (as defined)

The sum of the angles in triangle $ \triangle ADC $ is:
$$
x + \angle DAC + \angle ACD = 180^\circ
$$
Using Equation (2), $ \angle DAC + \angle ACD = 60^\circ $, so:
$$
x + 60^\circ = 180^\circ \Rightarrow x = 120^\circ
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

After analyzing the geometric configuration and applying basic triangle angle properties, we conclude that the measure of angle $ \angle CDA $ is:
$$
\boxed{x = 120^\circ}
$$
