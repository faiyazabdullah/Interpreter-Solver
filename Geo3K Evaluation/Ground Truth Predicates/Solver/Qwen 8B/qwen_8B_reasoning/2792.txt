<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out the measure of angle 3 given that angle 4 equals angle 5. Hmm, first I need to parse all these geometric constraints. Let me start by listing out all the given information so I can visualize the diagram better.

First, there are several angles mentioned with their measures:

- Angle DFG is 47 degrees.
- Angle FAD equals angle 6.
- Angle BFE equals angle 1.
- Angle EBF equals angle 2.
- Angle FEB is 63 degrees.
- Angle AFD equals angle 7.
- Angle CFB equals angle 3.
- Angle DAG is 136 degrees.
- Angle ABC equals angle 5.
- Angle BCF equals angle 4.
- Angle EFD is 69 degrees.

Also, points lie on certain lines:

- Point F lies on line AB.
- Point A lies on line BG.
- Point F lies on line BG (so same as above? Maybe line FG? Wait, original says PointLiesOnLine(F, Line(A,B)) which would mean F is on AB. Then also PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(B,G)), so point A is on BG. So maybe points A, B, G are colinear? Because A is on BG. Also, F is on BG as well. So points A, F, B, G are all on line BG? Wait, but then PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(F,G))? Wait, the third constraint is PointLiesOnLine(F, Line(B,G))—so F is on BG. The fourth constraint is PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(F,G)). So point A is on line FG. But earlier it said PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(B,G)). So line FG and BG must intersect at some point. Wait, maybe line FG is part of line BG?

Wait, perhaps I should draw a rough sketch mentally. Let me think:

Points A, B, G are on line BG. Since A is on line BG, and F is also on line BG. So points A, F, B, G are all on line BG. Then, point F is on line AB (since PointLiesOnLine(F, Line(A,B))). Wait, but if F is on line AB and also on line BG, then lines AB and BG intersect at point F? Which implies that points A, B, F, G are colinear? So line AB is the same as line BG? That might make sense. So AB is extended to G through point F?

But then, there's another constraint: PointLiesOnLine(F, Line(C,E)). So point F is also on line CE. So line CE passes through F. So CE intersects BG at point F.

Additionally, there's angle EFD is 69 degrees. So angle at F between E and D. Also, angle FEB is 63 degrees. So angle at E between F and B. 

Let me try to note down all these relationships. It might help to label the diagram step by step.

Starting with points on line BG: Points A, F, B, G are colinear. Since A is on BG, and F is on BG, and F is also on AB (from PointLiesOnLine(F, Line(A,B))), meaning that F is a point along AB such that when you extend AB beyond B to G, or maybe A is between F and B? Wait, depends on how they're arranged. But since F is on AB and on BG, then F must be the intersection of AB and BG. So AB and BG meet at point F. Therefore, points A, F, B are colinear, and F is also on BG. So BG is a straight line passing through F, with A somewhere on it. For example, suppose the order is A-F-B-G along line BG.

Then, there's line CE passing through F. So point F is also on line CE. So line CE connects points C and E, passing through F.

Now, looking at angles:

Angle DFG is 47 degrees. So point D, F, G form an angle at F. Since F is on BG, and G is on BG, so DG is connected to F? Or D is another point not on BG. Similarly, angle DAG is 136 degrees. So angle at A between D and G. Since A is on BG, and G is on BG, so AG is part of BG. Therefore, angle DAG is formed by DA and AG. Since AG is part of BG, DA is a line from D to A, making an angle with AG (which is along BG). So angle DAG is 136 degrees. So that tells us something about triangle D-A-G.

Also, angle EFD is 69 degrees. So angle at F between E and D. Since F is on CE and BG, and D is connected to F. So ED is connected to F, forming angle with FD. Also, angle FEB is 63 degrees. So angle at E between F and B. Since E is connected to B and F, and E is on line CE.

Moreover, angle EBF is equal to angle 2. So angle at B between E and F. Wait, angle EBF is angle at B between E and F. Since B is on BG, and E is connected to B and F. So that's another angle.

Also, angle BFE equals angle 1. So angle at F between B and E. Which is adjacent to angle EBF?

Wait, maybe we can consider triangle BEF. In triangle BEF, we have angles at B, E, F. We know angle at E is 63 degrees (angle FEB), angle at F is angle BFE which is angle 1, and angle at B is angle EBF which is angle 2. So sum of angles in triangle is 180. So angle1 + angle2 + 63 = 180 => angle1 + angle2 = 117 degrees. Not sure yet.

Also, angle DAG is 136 degrees. So in triangle DAG, angle at A is 136 degrees. If we can find other angles here, maybe we can get relations.

Also, angle DFG is 47 degrees. So angle at F between D and G. Since G is on BG, and F is on BG, so DG is connected to F. So DF is connected to F, and FG is part of BG. Therefore, angle DFG is between DF and FG, which is along BG. So that gives us info about triangle DFG or something else.

Another thing: angle AFD equals angle 7. So angle at F between A and D. Since A is on BG, and F is on BG, so AF is part of BG. Therefore, angle AFD is the angle at F between A (on BG) and D. So that would be angle between FA (along BG) and FD. So that's angle AFD = angle 7. And angle DFG is 47 degrees. Since angle AFD and angle DFG are adjacent, adding up to angle AFG? Wait, because F is on BG, so AF is going towards A, FG is going towards G. So if you look at point F, with lines AF and FG being colinear (since A, F, G are on BG). So angle between AF and FD is angle AFD, and angle between FD and FG is angle DFG. Therefore, those two angles add up to angle AFG, which is a straight line? Wait no, because FD is connected to D, so angle AFD + angle DFG = angle AFG? But since AF and FG are opposite directions (AF goes from F to A, FG goes from F to G), so if you imagine FD splitting into two angles at F: one towards A and one towards G. Wait, but angle AFD is between AF and FD, and angle DFG is between FD and FG. So total angle around point F between AF and FG would be angle AFD + angle DFG. However, AF and FG are colinear, so the total angle should be 180 degrees. So angle AFD + angle DFG = 180°. Therefore:

angle7 + 47° = 180° → angle7 = 180° - 47° = 133°. So angle7 is 133 degrees. Okay, that's useful.

So angle AFD (angle7) is 133 degrees.

Now, moving on. There's angle FAD equals angle6. So angle at A between F and D. So angle FAD is at point A between F and D. Since A is on BG, and F is on BG, AF is part of BG. So angle FAD is between AF (which is along BG) and AD. So triangle AFD has angle at A equal to angle6, angle at F equal to angle7=133°, and angle at D. Wait, but we might need more info here.

Alternatively, in triangle AFD, sum of angles is 180°, so angle6 + angle7 + angleADF = 180°. But without knowing angleADF, not helpful yet.

But maybe we can relate other parts. Also, angle DAG is 136 degrees. Since angle DAG is at point A between D and G. Since AG is along BG (as G is on BG), then angle DAG is between DA and AG. So that's the same as angle between DA and BG at point A. So angle DAG is 136°, which could be related to triangle DAG.

In triangle DAG, angles at A is 136°, angle at G, and angle at D. But again, unless we have more info, not sure.

Looking back at the other angles. There's angle EFD = 69°, which is angle at F between E and D. So that's angle EFD = 69°, which is part of triangle EFD. Also, angle FEB = 63°, which is angle at E between F and B. As before, in triangle BEF, angles sum to 180°, so angle1 + angle2 + 63° = 180° ⇒ angle1 + angle2 = 117°. 

Also, angle BFE is angle1, which is angle at F between B and E. So that's part of triangle BEF.

Now, considering that point F is on line CE. So line CE passes through F. Therefore, points C, E, F are colinear with F between C and E? Or not necessarily. But since F is on CE, then CF and FE are parts of line CE.

Also, angle CFB equals angle3. So angle at F between C and B. Since F is on CE and on BG, then CB is connected to F. So angle CFB is at F between C and B. So that's angle between FC and FB. Since FB is part of BG (since B is on BG and F is on BG), and FC is part of CE. So angle CFB is the angle between line CE (at F) and line BG (at F).

Hmm. Now, the key relation given is that angle4 equals angle5. Angle4 is measure of angle BCF, which is angle at C between B and F. And angle5 is measure of angle ABC, which is angle at B between A and C. So angle4 = angle5.

Our goal is to find measure of angle3, which is angle CFB.

Let me see if I can find relations involving angle4 and angle5.

Since angle4 is angle BCF (at C between B and F), and angle5 is angle ABC (at B between A and C). So angle ABC is part of line AB (since A, B, F are colinear), so angle ABC is the angle at B between A and C. Wait, but if point C is connected to B, then angle ABC is formed by BA and BC. But BA is part of BG, and BC is another line from B to C. So angle ABC is at B between A and C.

Similarly, angle BCF is at C between B and F. So angle BCF is part of triangle BCF, which involves points B, C, F.

Maybe using triangle BCF? Let's think. In triangle BCF, angles at B, C, F. Let me denote them:

At B: angle BFC? No, angle at B is angle FBC. Wait, angle BCF is at C. So angle at C is angle BCF (angle4). At B, it's angle FBC, which is angle2? Wait, earlier we had angle EBF = angle2. Is angle FBC related to that?

Earlier, angle EBF was at B between E and F. So that's different from angle FBC, which is at B between F and C. Unless E and C are aligned somehow. Not sure yet.

Alternatively, since F is on line CE, then line CE passes through F. So point E is connected to C and F. So angle EBF is at B between E and F. So BE is connected to B and E. Since E is on line CE, then BE connects B to E, which is on line CE. So maybe triangles involved here.

This seems complex, but maybe we can use some triangle properties or parallel lines, or supplementary angles.

Let me recap the known angles:

From earlier steps:

- angle7 = 133° (angle AFD)

Also, angle DAG = 136°, which is at A between D and G.

Also, angle DFG = 47°, leading to angle AFD = 133°, as established.

Now, let's consider triangle AFD. Its angles are:

At A: angle FAD = angle6

At F: angle AFD = 133°

At D: angle FDA

Sum to 180°, so angle6 + 133° + angleFDA = 180° ⇒ angleFDA = 180° - 133° - angle6 = 47° - angle6.

Wait, 180 - 133 is 47, so angleFDA = 47° - angle6. Interesting.

But angleFDA is the angle at D between F and A. So that's part of triangle FDA.

Not sure yet. Let me check for other angles.

We also have angle EFD = 69°, which is angle at F between E and D. So that's angle EFD = 69°, which is part of triangle EFD. In triangle EFD, angles are:

At F: 69°, at E: ?, at D: ?

But angle at E is angle FED, and angle at D is angle EDF.

But maybe connecting with other angles.

Also, angle FEB = 63°, which is angle at E between F and B. So in triangle BEF, angles are:

At E: 63°, at F: angle1, at B: angle2. Sum to 180°, so angle1 + angle2 = 117°.

Now, considering line CE passing through F. So line CE includes points C, F, E. So angle at F between C and E is a straight line? No, since F is just a point on CE, so line CE is straight. So angle CFE is 180°, but maybe considering other angles.

Also, angle CFB is angle3, which is at F between C and B. Since F is on line CE, then angle CFB is between line CF (part of CE) and line FB (part of BG). So angle CFB is formed by lines CF and FB.

If we can find relations between these angles...

Also, angle ABC is angle5, which is at B between A and C. Since A, B, F are colinear, angle ABC is formed by BA (which is along BG) and BC. So angle ABC is between BA and BC.

Given that angle4 (angle BCF) equals angle5 (angle ABC). So angle BCF = angle ABC. Maybe implying some similar triangles or alternate interior angles?

Wait, angle BCF is at point C between B and F. Angle ABC is at point B between A and C. If these are equal, maybe there's a relationship between triangles ABC and something else?

Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines or Cosines in some triangles.

Alternatively, considering that angle BCF = angle ABC, which suggests that triangle BCF may be similar to another triangle?

Wait, let's consider triangle BCF and triangle ABC. If angle BCF = angle ABC, and if another angle is shared, maybe similarity?

But not sure yet. Alternatively, maybe using the fact that angle BCF = angle ABC, which could imply that line CF is parallel to some line? For instance, if angle BCF equals angle ABC, then maybe CF is parallel to AB? Wait, because if a transversal crosses two lines and creates corresponding angles equal, then the lines are parallel. Here, if angle ABC and angle BCF are corresponding angles, then maybe AB || CF? Let me think.

Imagine AB and CF are two lines. If angle ABC (at B) is equal to angle BCF (at C), then depending on the configuration, they might be corresponding angles if CF is parallel to AB. Let me visualize: if AB is a line, and CF is another line, with point C somewhere. If angle at B (ABC) and angle at C (BCF) are equal, then yes, if CF is parallel to AB, then those angles would be equal. Therefore, maybe AB || CF.

Assuming that AB || CF, then angle ABC = angle BCF (given angle4 = angle5), so that would make sense. Therefore, AB || CF.

If that's true, then maybe we can use properties of parallel lines.

But how does that help us find angle3, which is angle CFB?

Well, if AB || CF, then the transversal BF would create corresponding angles. Let's see. If AB || CF, and BF is a transversal, then angle ABC (which is angle between AB and BF) would correspond to angle BFC (which is angle between CF and BF). Wait, but angle ABC is angle at B, and angle BFC is angle at F. So if AB || CF, then angle ABC corresponds to angle BFC. Hence, angle ABC = angle BFC. But angle BFC is angle3. Wait, angle BFC is angle at F between B and C, which is angle3. Therefore, angle ABC = angle3. But angle ABC is angle5. Given that angle4 = angle5, so angle4 = angle5 = angle3. Therefore, angle3 = angle4 = angle5. But wait, the question states that angle4 = angle5, so angle3 would be equal to them? But that seems too direct. Wait, but let me check again.

If AB || CF, then angle ABC (at B) is equal to angle BFC (at F). Therefore, angle5 (ABC) = angle3 (BFC). But since angle4 = angle5, then angle4 = angle5 = angle3. Therefore, angle3 = angle4. But we need to find angle3. How do we find angle4?

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me re-examine the assumption that AB || CF.

Because angle ABC = angle BCF (given angle4 = angle5). Wait, angle BCF is angle at C between B and F, which is angle4. Angle ABC is angle at B between A and C, which is angle5. So angle4 = angle5. So angle BCF = angle ABC. This would suggest that AB || CF if they are corresponding angles. So yes, if AB || CF, then those angles are equal. So assuming AB || CF, then angle3 (which is angle BFC) would be equal to angle ABC (angle5). But since angle4 = angle5, then angle3 = angle5 = angle4. Therefore, angle3 = angle4. But how do we find angle4?

Alternatively, maybe we can compute angle4 using other information. Let's think.

Let me consider triangle BCF. In triangle BCF, we have angles at B, C, F. Let me denote:

At B: angle FBC = ?

At C: angle BCF = angle4

At F: angle CFB = angle3.

But we don't know angle FBC directly. However, maybe angle FBC relates to other angles.

Earlier, we considered triangle BEF, where angle at E is 63°, angle at F is angle1, angle at B is angle2. And angle1 + angle2 = 117°. Also, angle FBC is adjacent to angle2? Wait, angle2 is angle EBF, which is angle at B between E and F. So angle EBF is angle2, which is part of angle FBC if point E is aligned with C. Wait, if line CE passes through F, then E is on line CE. If we assume that point E is positioned such that line BE connects to E, then angle EBF (angle2) is part of angle FBC?

Wait, if we consider line BE and line BC. Suppose point E is on line CE, so line BE connects B to E. Then, angle EBF is part of angle FBC if line BE is extending to E. Wait, but without knowing the exact position, it's hard to say. Alternatively, maybe angle EBF and angle FBC are supplementary or something?

Alternatively, since F is on line CE, and B is connected to E, then line BE connects to E, and F is on CE. So if we consider triangle BEF, which we discussed earlier, and maybe connect that with other elements.

Alternatively, since we have angle EFD = 69°, which is angle at F between E and D. Earlier, we saw that angle EFD = 69°, and angle DFG = 47°, which together gave angle AFD = 133°. Also, angle AFD is part of triangle AFD, which we discussed.

Perhaps focusing on triangle DFG. Wait, angle DFG is 47°, and angle at F is between D and G. Also, angle DAG is 136°, which is at A between D and G. Maybe considering quadrilateral or triangle involving D, A, G, F?

Alternatively, since angle DAG is 136°, and angle AFD is 133°, which is adjacent to angle DFG (47°). Wait, earlier we saw that angle AFD + angle DFG = 180°, which makes sense because they are on a straight line. So that gives angle7 = 133°, as we computed.

Now, let's think about triangle AFD. We have angle at A (angle6), angle at F (133°), angle at D (let's call it x). So angle6 + 133° + x = 180°, so x = 47° - angle6. So angle at D, which is angle FDA = 47° - angle6.

But angle FDA is also part of triangle DFG? Or maybe triangle DGA?

Wait, point D is connected to A and G. From angle DAG = 136°, which is at A between D and G. So triangle DAG has angles at A, D, G. We know angle at A is 136°, and if we can find other angles.

But without more info, not sure. However, maybe there's another way.

Let me think about the line CE passing through F. So line CE contains points C, F, E. So angle EFD = 69°, which is at F between E and D. So that's angle EFD = 69°, which is part of triangle EFD. In triangle EFD, we have:

At F: 69°, at E: let's call it y, at D: z. So y + z + 69° = 180°, so y + z = 111°.

But what is angle at E, y? That's angle FED, which is part of triangle EFD.

Also, angle FEB = 63°, which is at E between F and B. So angle FEB = 63°, which is adjacent to angle FED? Depending on the position of D and B relative to E.

Wait, if E is on line CE, and B is connected to E, then angle FEB is at E between F and B, while angle FED is at E between F and D. So if points B and D are on opposite sides of line EF, then angle FEB and angle FED would be supplementary or something. But without knowing the exact positions, it's tricky.

Alternatively, since we have angle EFD = 69°, and angle FEB = 63°, perhaps considering triangle EFD and triangle EFB?

Wait, in triangle EFB, we have angle at E = 63°, angle at F = angle1, angle at B = angle2. As before, angle1 + angle2 = 117°.

If we can find angle1 or angle2, that would help.

But how?

Alternatively, considering that angle at E in triangle EFD is angle FED = y, which might relate to angle FEB = 63°. If points B and D are on the same side of line EF, then angle FED + angle FEB = something. But without a diagram, it's challenging.

Alternatively, think about line ED. Since angle EFD = 69°, and angle FEB = 63°, maybe there's a way to express other angles.

Alternatively, let's go back to the main goal: finding angle3 = angle CFB. Assuming AB || CF, which we thought earlier, then angle3 = angle5 = angle4. But how to find angle4?

Angle4 is angle BCF. Let me consider triangle BCF. In triangle BCF, angles are at B, C, F: angle FBC, angle BCF (angle4), and angle CFB (angle3). So angle FBC + angle4 + angle3 = 180°. But angle FBC is angle at B between F and C. Earlier, we had angle EBF = angle2, which is at B between E and F. If we can relate angle FBC to angle2.

Suppose that angle FBC is adjacent to angle EBF. If points E and C are on opposite sides of line BF, then angle EBF + angle FBC = 180°, but that depends on the configuration. Alternatively, if E and C are on the same side, then angle EBF and angle FBC could be supplementary or something else.

Wait, since F is on line CE, and E is on line CE, then line CE extends through F. So if we consider point C, then line CE goes through F and E. So if we consider point B, and line BC, then angle FBC is part of angle EBC? Wait, if E is on line CE, then line BE connects B to E, which is on line CE. So angle EBF is part of angle EBC if F is between E and C. Wait, if F is between E and C, then line CE goes from C through F to E. So from point C, going through F to E. Therefore, angle EBF would be part of angle EBC. Wait, if F is between C and E, then line CF is part of line CE. So angle EBF is the angle at B between E and F. If F is between C and E, then line BF connects B to F, which is between C and E. So angle EBF is at B between E and F, which is part of angle EBC. So angle EBC = angle EBF + angle FBC. Wait, if F is between C and E, then from point B, looking at E and C, the angle between BE and BC would include angle EBF and angle FBC. So angle EBC = angle EBF + angle FBC. But angle EBF is angle2, and angle FBC is angle at B in triangle BCF.

However, we don't know angle EBC. But maybe we can find it from elsewhere.

Alternatively, since angle EBC is part of triangle EBC. But without more information, not sure.

Wait, but if we assume AB || CF, then angle ABC = angle BFC (angle3). And since angle ABC = angle5, and angle4 = angle5, then angle3 = angle4 = angle5. So angle3 = angle5. But angle5 is angle ABC. To find angle5, we need to find angle ABC.

How to find angle ABC? It is at point B between A and C. Since A, B, F are colinear, angle ABC is formed by BA and BC. If we can find angle between BA and BC.

Alternatively, if AB || CF, then angle ABC (at B) is equal to angle BFC (at F), which is angle3. So angle3 = angle5 = angle4. But we still need to find angle3.

Wait, but if angle3 = angle4 = angle5, and we can find angle4 or angle5 via other means, then we can determine angle3.

Let me think: angle4 is angle BCF. Let's consider triangle BCF. We have angle BCF = angle4, angle CFB = angle3, and angle FBC = ?. If we can find angle FBC, then we can write angle4 + angle3 + angle FBC = 180°. But how?

Earlier, we had in triangle BEF, angle1 + angle2 = 117°. If we can relate angle2 to angle FBC.

Assume that angle FBC is angle2. Wait, no. Angle2 is angle EBF, which is at B between E and F. If angle FBC is at B between F and C, then angle EBF (angle2) and angle FBC are adjacent angles at point B, forming angle EBC. So angle EBC = angle2 + angle FBC. But unless we know angle EBC, this isn't helpful.

But maybe angle EBC is related to other angles. For example, in triangle EBC, but we don't know much about it.

Alternatively, since line CE passes through F, and angle EFD = 69°, and angle FEB = 63°, maybe there's a way to relate these angles to others.

Wait, in triangle EFD, we have angle at F is 69°, angle at E is y, angle at D is z. And y + z = 111°. If we can relate y or z to other angles.

Also, angle at D in triangle EFD is angle EDF. Which is part of angle FDA from earlier, which was 47° - angle6. Wait, angle FDA is at D between F and A. So angle EDF is part of that? If points E and A are on the same side of line DF, then angle EDF and angle FDA could be related.

But without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to tell. This is getting quite tangled. Maybe I need to approach this differently.

Let me recall that angle DAG = 136°, which is at A between D and G. Since A is on BG, and G is on BG, so AG is part of BG. Thus, angle DAG is the angle between DA and AG. So DA is a line from D to A, making an angle of 136° with AG (which is along BG). So that means that DA is forming a large angle with BG at point A. So if I consider triangle DAG, with angle at A = 136°, and other angles at D and G.

In triangle DAG, angles at D and G would add up to 44° (since 180 - 136 = 44). But without more info, not helpful yet.

But if we can relate angle at D in triangle DAG to angle at D in triangle EDF or something else.

Alternatively, let's think about the sum of angles around point D. If there are multiple angles meeting at D, like angle FDA (from triangle DFA), angle EDF (from triangle EDF), and possibly others. But without a clear diagram, it's difficult.

Wait, but earlier we had angle FDA = 47° - angle6. And angle EDF (in triangle EDF) is part of the same line? If points E, D, and F are connected, then angle EDF is at D between E and F. If angle FDA is at D between F and A, then angle EDA would be angle EDF + angle FDA, assuming points E, F, A are arranged in a way that allows that. But again, without knowing the exact configuration, it's speculative.

Alternatively, since angle DAG is 136°, and angle DAG is at A between D and G, and angle AFD is 133°, which is at F between A and D. Maybe there's a cyclic quadrilateral or something, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, let me try to consider the entire picture. If AB || CF, then angle ABC = angle BFC = angle3. And angle4 = angle5 = angle ABC = angle3. So angle3 = angle4 = angle5. But how to find angle3?

Let me think about triangle BCF. If angle3 = angle5 = angle4, and angle4 is angle BCF, then in triangle BCF, angle4 + angle3 + angle FBC = 180°. If angle3 = angle4, then 2*angle3 + angle FBC = 180°. So angle FBC = 180° - 2*angle3.

But angle FBC is angle at B between F and C, which is part of angle EBC. Earlier, we had in triangle BEF, angle1 + angle2 = 117°. If angle2 is angle EBF, which is part of angle FBC, then maybe angle2 + angle FBC = angle EBC. But without knowing angle EBC, it's not helpful.

Alternatively, if I can find angle FBC using other means. Let's think about line CE passing through F. If AB || CF, then line AB is parallel to CF. So the slope of AB is the same as slope of CF. But since we are dealing with angles, maybe using the fact that corresponding angles are equal.

Wait, if AB || CF, then the transversal BC would create corresponding angles. So angle ABC (at B) corresponds to angle BCF (at C), which is given to be equal (since angle4 = angle5). This confirms our earlier assumption that AB || CF. So this holds.

Therefore, angle ABC = angle BCF = angle4 = angle5. So angle3 (which is angle BFC) is equal to angle ABC (angle5). But since angle4 = angle5, then angle3 = angle5 = angle4. So angle3 is equal to angle4, which is equal to angle5. But how to find its value?

To find angle3, we need to find angle4 or angle5. Let's focus on angle5, which is angle ABC. Let's try to find angle ABC.

Angle ABC is at point B between A and C. Since A, B, F are colinear, and F is on line CE. Let me consider triangle ABC. In triangle ABC, we have angles at A, B, C. But we don't know much about it.

Alternatively, since AB || CF, and line BC is a transversal, then angle ABC (at B) is equal to angle BCF (at C), which is angle4. So angle4 = angle5 = angle ABC. But how to find angle4?

Let me think about triangle BCF. In triangle BCF, we have angle at C: angle4, angle at F: angle3, angle at B: angle FBC. And angle4 + angle3 + angle FBC = 180°. But since angle3 = angle4, this becomes 2*angle4 + angle FBC = 180°. So angle FBC = 180° - 2*angle4.

Now, angle FBC is also part of angle EBC. If we can find angle EBC, we can relate it to angle FBC.

Angle EBC is the angle at B between E and C. Which is composed of angle EBF (angle2) and angle FBC (if F is between E and C). So angle EBC = angle2 + angle FBC. So:

angle2 + angle FBC = angle EBC.

But how to find angle EBC?

Looking back at triangle BEF, where we had angle1 + angle2 = 117°. If we can find angle1 or angle2, we can proceed.

But angle1 is angle BFE, which is at F between B and E. Let's consider triangle BFE. In triangle BFE, angles are at B: angle2, at E: 63°, at F: angle1. So angle1 + angle2 = 117°, as before.

If we can find angle1 or angle2, we can find the other.

But how?

Let me think about line CE passing through F. So line CE has points C, F, E. So line CE is straight. Therefore, angle at F between C and E is a straight line, so angle CFE = 180°. But angle CFE is made up of angle CFB (angle3) and angle BFE (angle1)? Wait, if F is between C and E, then line CF goes to F, and then FE continues to E. So at point F, the angle between CF and FE is 180°. But angle CFB is at F between C and B, and angle BFE is at F between B and E. So if line CF and FE form a straight line, then angle CFB + angle BFE = 180°. Wait, no. Because angle CFB is between C and B, and angle BFE is between B and E. If line CF and FE are in a straight line, then the sum of angle CFB and angle BFE would depend on the position of B relative to line CF and FE.

Wait, let me clarify. At point F, there are several lines:

- Line CF (part of line CE)
- Line FE (same as line CF, since F is on CE)
- Line FB (connecting F to B)
- Line FD (connecting F to D)
- Line FA (part of line BG)

So at point F, the lines CF (and FE) are in one direction, and line FB is another direction. So angle between CF and FB is angle CFB (angle3), and angle between FB and FE is angle BFE (angle1). Since CF and FE are in a straight line (line CE), the sum of angle CFB and angle BFE should be 180°. Because they are adjacent angles forming a linear pair along line CE. So:

angle CFB + angle BFE = 180°
=> angle3 + angle1 = 180°
=> angle1 = 180° - angle3

But earlier, from triangle BEF, we had angle1 + angle2 = 117°. So substituting angle1:

(180° - angle3) + angle2 = 117°
=> angle2 = 117° - 180° + angle3
=> angle2 = angle3 - 63°

Now, remember that angle2 is part of angle EBC, which is angle2 + angle FBC = angle EBC. And earlier, in triangle BCF, angle FBC = 180° - 2*angle4. But angle4 = angle5 = angle ABC. And angle ABC is angle at B between A and C, which is angle5.

But how to relate angle EBC to other angles?

If we can find angle EBC, then we can relate it to angle FBC, and hence to angle3.

But angle EBC is part of triangle EBC. Let me think about triangle EBC. It has angles at E, B, C. At E, we have angle BEC, which might be related to angle FEB = 63°. Let me see.

At point E, angle FEB = 63°, which is part of angle BEC. If line EC passes through F, then angle BEC is composed of angle BEF (which is 63°) and angle FEC. But angle FEC is part of line CE, so if we consider line EC, then angle FEC is zero? No, because F is on CE, so angle FEC is the angle at E between F and C, which is a straight line. Wait, no. At point E, line CE is straight, so angle between E and F is part of that line. So if we consider angle at E between B and C, it's angle BEC. Which is composed of angle BEF (63°) and angle FEC. But since F is on CE, angle FEC is a straight line, so angle FEC = 180°? No, angle at E between F and C is a straight line, so it's 180°, but angle BEC would be angle between BE and EC, which is angle BEF + angle FEC? No, if F is between C and E, then angle BEC is angle between BE and EC, which would include angle BEF (63°) and angle FEC, but since F is on EC, angle FEC is zero? No, this is confusing.

Actually, since F is on line CE, then at point E, the line EC extends through F. So angle BEC is the angle at E between B and C, which is the same as angle BEF, because F is on EC. Wait, no. If F is on EC, then angle BEC is the same as angle BEF, because F is on EC. So angle BEC = angle BEF = 63°. Therefore, in triangle EBC, angle at E is 63°, angle at B is angle EBC, and angle at C is angle ECB. So sum of angles is 180°, so:

angle EBC + angle ECB + 63° = 180°
=> angle EBC + angle ECB = 117°

But angle ECB is angle at C between E and B, which is angle BCE. Which is part of angle BCF (angle4) if line CB extends to E. Wait, if line CB meets line CE at point C, then angle BCE is the same as angle BCF (angle4)? No, angle BCF is at C between B and F, whereas angle BCE is at C between B and E. Since F is on CE, angle BCE is the same as angle BCF if F is between C and E. Yes! Because if F is on CE, then angle BCE is the same as angle BCF, because F is on CE. So angle BCE = angle BCF = angle4. 

Thus, in triangle EBC, we have:

angle EBC + angle4 + 63° = 180°
=> angle EBC = 117° - angle4

But earlier, we had angle EBC = angle2 + angle FBC. And angle FBC = 180° - 2*angle4 (from triangle BCF). So:

angle EBC = angle2 + (180° - 2*angle4)

But angle EBC is also equal to 117° - angle4. So:

117° - angle4 = angle2 + 180° - 2*angle4
=> 117° - angle4 = angle2 + 180° - 2*angle4
Rearranging terms:
117° - angle4 - 180° + 2*angle4 = angle2
=> (117° - 180°) + angle4 = angle2
=> -63° + angle4 = angle2

Which matches what we derived earlier: angle2 = angle3 - 63°, since angle2 = angle3 - 63°, and angle3 = angle4 (since angle3 = angle5 = angle4). Wait, no, earlier we had angle2 = angle3 - 63°, but here we have angle2 = angle4 - 63°. Wait, this is conflicting. Let me check.

Wait, previously, from the equation angle1 = 180° - angle3, and angle1 + angle2 = 117°, giving angle2 = 117° - angle1 = 117° - (180° - angle3) = angle3 - 63°. So angle2 = angle3 - 63°.

But from this latest equation, we have angle2 = angle4 - 63°. So combining both results, angle2 = angle3 - 63° and angle2 = angle4 - 63°, so angle3 = angle4. Which is consistent with our previous conclusion that angle3 = angle4. So this doesn't give new information.

But we need to find angle3. Let me try to find another equation.

We have angle2 = angle3 - 63°, and from angle EBC = 117° - angle4, and angle EBC = angle2 + angle FBC = (angle3 - 63°) + (180° - 2*angle4). But since angle3 = angle4, replace angle4 with angle3:

angle EBC = (angle3 - 63°) + (180° - 2*angle3) = angle3 - 63° + 180° - 2*angle3 = -angle3 + 117°.

But angle EBC is also equal to 117° - angle4 = 117° - angle3. So both expressions match, confirming consistency.

This suggests that we need another equation to solve for angle3.

Let me think about other angles. Recall that in triangle AFD, we had angle at D: angleFDA = 47° - angle6. And angle FDA is part of triangle FDA, which is connected to other parts.

Also, in triangle EFD, we had angle at F: 69°, angle at E: y, angle at D: z, with y + z = 111°. If we can relate angle z to angleFDA.

Assuming that angle z (angle at D in triangle EFD) is the same as angleFDA, which is 47° - angle6. If that's the case, then:

z = 47° - angle6.

But then y = 111° - z = 111° - (47° - angle6) = 64° + angle6.

But what is angle y? Angle y is angle FED in triangle EFD, which is at E between F and D. This angle might be related to angle FEB = 63°.

If points D and B are on opposite sides of line EF, then angle FED + angle FEB = 180°, making them supplementary. So if that's the case:

y + 63° = 180°
=> y = 117°

But from earlier, y = 64° + angle6. So:

64° + angle6 = 117°
=> angle6 = 117° - 64° = 53°

So angle6 = 53°. 

Now, if angle6 is 53°, then angleFDA = 47° - angle6 = 47° - 53° = -6°, which is impossible. Wait, negative angle? That can't be. So this suggests my assumption that angle z = angleFDA is incorrect.

Where did I go wrong? I assumed that angle z (angle at D in triangle EFD) is the same as angleFDA, but that might not be the case. Perhaps angleFDA and angle z are separate angles at D.

Let me rethink. AngleFDA is at D between F and A, while angle z is at D between F and E. These are two different angles at D, so they don't have to be equal. So my previous assumption was wrong.

Alternative approach: Let's consider triangle EFD and triangle AFD. Both involve point D and F. Maybe there's a way to relate them.

In triangle EFD, angle at D is z, and in triangle AFD, angle at D is angleFDA = 47° - angle6. These are two different angles at D, but perhaps they are supplementary or something if points A, E are on opposite sides of DF. Without knowing the diagram, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, if we can find angle6 from somewhere else.

Wait, angle6 is angle FAD, which is at A between F and D. Since A is on BG, and F is on BG, AF is part of BG. So angle FAD is the angle between AF (along BG) and AD. So in triangle AFD, angle at A is angle6, angle at F is 133°, angle at D is 47° - angle6. 

But if we can find angle6 from another source, that would help. Let me think about other angles involving point A.

Angle DAG is 136°, which is at A between D and G. Since AG is part of BG, and angle DAG is 136°, then the angle between DA and AG is 136°. So if we consider triangle DAG, we have angle at A = 136°, angle at G, and angle at D.

Let me denote angle at G as w, and angle at D as v. So:

angle6 + w + v = 180°

But angle v is angle at D between G and A, which is part of angleFDA (47° - angle6) if points G and F are on the same side of DA. But again, without knowing the diagram, it's unclear.

Alternatively, if I consider that angle at D in triangle DAG (v) is the same as angleFDA (47° - angle6). If that's the case, then:

v = 47° - angle6.

But in triangle DAG, angle at D is v = 47° - angle6, angle at A is 136°, so angle at G (w) = 180° - 136° - (47° - angle6) = 44° + angle6.

But angle at G in triangle DAG is angle AGD. If we can relate this angle to other parts.

But I don't see a direct connection. However, if we consider line GD, and other angles.

Alternatively, since angle at G in triangle DAG is w = 44° + angle6, and if there's a way to relate this to other angles.

This seems too vague. Let me think back to the earlier assumption where we had angle6 = 53°, leading to a contradiction. That suggests that my assumption about angle y + 63° = 180° was incorrect. Maybe angle y is not supplementary to 63°, but something else.

Let me revisit that. If angle FED = y, and angle FEB = 63°, and if points D and B are on the same side of line EF, then angle FED and angle FEB could be part of a larger angle or something. For example, if D and B are on the same side, then angle FED + angle FEB = some value.

Alternatively, if line DB passes through F, but that's not stated.

Without more information, this seems stuck. Let me try to use the earlier result where angle2 = angle3 - 63°, and try to find another relation.

Recall that in triangle BCF, angle FBC = 180° - 2*angle4. And angle FBC = angle2 + ...? Wait, earlier we had angle EBC = angle2 + angle FBC, and angle EBC = 117° - angle4. So:

angle2 + angle FBC = 117° - angle4

But angle FBC = 180° - 2*angle4, so:

angle2 + (180° - 2*angle4) = 117° - angle4

Substituting angle2 = angle3 - 63°, and angle3 = angle4:

angle4 - 63° + 180° - 2*angle4 = 117° - angle4

Simplify left side:

(180° - 63°) - angle4 = 117° - angle4

Which gives:

117° - angle4 = 117° - angle4

Which is an identity, providing no new information. So this approach is not helping.

I need to find another way. Let's recall that angle7 = 133°, which is angle AFD. And angle AFD is part of triangle AFD, where angle at A is angle6, angle at F is 133°, and angle at D is 47° - angle6.

If I can find angle6, I can find angle at D, and possibly relate it to other parts.

Let me consider triangle AFD and triangle EFD. If there is a relationship between them, like similarity or something.

Alternatively, since angle at D in triangle AFD is 47° - angle6, and if that angle is related to angle z in triangle EFD (which was 111° - y), but I don't see the link.

Wait, let me try to assume that angle6 is 53°, even though it led to a negative angle earlier. If angle6 = 53°, then angleFDA = 47° - 53° = -6°, which is impossible. So that suggests that my assumption about angle y + 63° = 180° was wrong.

Maybe instead, angle y = 63°, and angle FED = 63°? But why?

If angle FED = 63°, then in triangle EFD, y = 63°, so z = 111° - 63° = 48°. Then, angle z = 48°, which is angle at D in triangle EFD. If this angle z is the same as angle at D in triangle AFD, which is 47° - angle6, then:

47° - angle6 = 48° → angle6 = -1°, which is still impossible. So this approach is flawed.

Alternatively, perhaps angle y = 63°, and angle z = 48°, and angle z is related to angle at D in triangle AFD. If angle z = 48°, and angle at D in triangle AFD is 47° - angle6, then 47° - angle6 = 48° → angle6 = -1°, still no good.

This suggests that my assumptions about the relationship between angles in these triangles are incorrect. Perhaps I need to find angle6 from another source.

Wait, let's think about the entire diagram. We have multiple angles and lines. Let me try to summarize what I know:

- Angle DFG = 47°
- Angle AFD = 133° (from 180 - 47)
- Angle DAG = 136°
- Angle EFD = 69°
- Angle FEB = 63°
- Angle ABC = angle5 = angle4 = angle3
- AB || CF
- Angle1 + angle2 = 117°
- angle1 = 180° - angle3
- angle2 = angle3 - 63°
- In triangle BCF: angle3 + angle4 + angle FBC = 180°, and angle3 = angle4, so 2*angle3 + angle FBC = 180°, so angle FBC = 180° - 2*angle3
- In triangle EBC: angle EBC + angle4 + 63° = 180°, so angle EBC = 117° - angle4 = 117° - angle3
- angle EBC = angle2 + angle FBC = (angle3 - 63°) + (180° - 2*angle3) = -angle3 + 117°, which matches.

But this leads us in circles. Maybe I need to use the fact that angle DAG = 136°, and angle at A in triangle DAG is 136°, and relate it to other angles.

In triangle DAG, angle at A is 136°, and if I can find other angles. Let's say angle at G is w, angle at D is v. So:

136° + w + v = 180° => w + v = 44°

If I can find either w or v, I can find the other. Let's assume that angle v is the same as angle at D in triangle AFD, which is 47° - angle6. If this is true, then v = 47° - angle6, and w = 44° - v = 44° - (47° - angle6) = angle6 - 3°.

But what is angle w? Angle at G in triangle DAG is angle AGD. If I can relate this to other parts.

Since G is on line BG, and D is some point, angle AGD is at G between A and D. If line GD is connected, but without more info, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, if line GD is part of some other triangle or line.

Alternatively, if I consider that angle AGD is part of a straight line or something. But without more info, I can't proceed.

This seems like a dead end. Let me try to think differently. Since angle3 = angle4 = angle5, and angle5 is angle ABC, let's try to find angle ABC.

Angle ABC is at B between A and C. Since A, B, F are colinear, and F is on line CE, which passes through F. Let me consider triangle ABC. If I can find other angles in this triangle.

But I don't know much about it. However, if AB || CF, then angle ABC = angle BCF = angle4. So angle4 = angle5 = angle3. But how to find angle4?

Let me think about triangle BCF. If I can find angle FBC, then I can use the earlier equation: 2*angle3 + angle FBC = 180°. But angle FBC = angle2 + angle FBC? No, angle FBC is already part of it.

Wait, angle FBC is part of angle EBC, which is 117° - angle3. And angle FBC = 180° - 2*angle3. So:

117° - angle3 = angle2 + (180° - 2*angle3)

But angle2 = angle3 - 63°, so:

117° - angle3 = (angle3 - 63°) + 180° - 2*angle3

Simplify right side:

angle3 - 63° + 180° - 2*angle3 = -angle3 + 117°

Left side: 117° - angle3

So both sides are equal, again giving no new information.

This suggests that the system is underdetermined, and we need to use another piece of information.

Let me recall that angle EFD = 69°, and angle DFG = 47°, and angle AFD = 133°. Also, angle DAG = 136°.

Let me consider triangle DGF. Wait, points D, G, F. We know angle at F is 47°, and angle at G is...? If I can find other angles.

But without knowing more about this triangle, it's hard. Alternatively, consider triangle DGF and triangle DAG.

Wait, angle at G in triangle DAG is angle AGD, which we denoted as w = angle6 - 3°. If this angle is related to angle at G in triangle DGF, but I don't see the connection.

At this point, I'm stuck. Let me try to make an educated guess based on the possible answer choices.

The answer choices are 116, 126, 136, 146. Let me think about common angle values.

Earlier, we had angle7 = 133°, which is close to 136°, which is one of the choices. Also, angle DAG is 136°, which is one of the choices. Maybe angle3 is 136°, which is option C.

But why? Let me think: if angle3 = 136°, then angle4 = 136°, and angle5 = 136°. Let's check if this is possible.

If angle3 = 136°, then in triangle BCF, angle3 + angle4 + angle FBC = 180°, and since angle3 = angle4 = 136°, this would give 136 + 136 + angle FBC = 180 → angle FBC = 180 - 272 = -92°, which is impossible. So that can't be.

So option C is invalid.

Next, let's try option B: 126°. If angle3 = 126°, then angle4 = 126°, and angle5 = 126°. In triangle BCF, 126 + 126 + angle FBC = 180 → angle FBC = 180 - 252 = -72°, also impossible.

Option A: 116°. Then angle3 = 116°, angle4 = 116°, angle5 = 116°. In triangle BCF: 116 + 116 + angle FBC = 180 → angle FBC = 180 - 232 = -52°, still impossible.

Option D: 146°. angle3 = 146°, angle4 = 146°, angle5 = 146°. In triangle BCF: 146 + 146 + angle FBC = 180 → angle FBC = 180 - 292 = -112°, nope.

All options lead to negative angles, which is impossible. This suggests that my assumption that angle3 = angle4 = angle5 is wrong, or there is a miscalculation.

Wait, but earlier I assumed AB || CF, leading to angle ABC = angle BCF, which is angle4 = angle5. But maybe this assumption is wrong. Let me reconsider.

If angle4 = angle5, but not necessarily because of parallel lines. Maybe there's another reason.

Let me think: angle4 is angle BCF, angle5 is angle ABC. If I can show that triangle ABC and triangle BCF are similar or something.

Alternatively, if I consider the sum of angles around point F.

At point F, we have several angles:

- angle AFD = 133° (angle7)
- angle DFG = 47°
- angle EFD = 69°
- angle BFE = angle1
- angle CFB = angle3

But these angles might overlap or add up to certain values.

For example, around point F, the sum of all angles is 360°. Let's see:

At point F, the angles around it include:

- angle AFD (133°)
- angle DFG (47°)
- angle EFD (69°)
- angle BFE (angle1)
- angle CFB (angle3)
- and possibly others, depending on the diagram.

But it's complicated to account for all, but let's try to consider the angles around F.

If lines AF, FG, FE, FB, FC are present at point F, then the sum of angles around F should be 360°. Let's list the angles:

- Between AF and FE: this would be angle AFE, which is angle AFD + angle DFG + angle GFE? No, need to be precise.

Actually, it's easier to consider the angles formed by each pair of lines at F. Let me try to identify all angles at F:

1. Angle between AF and FE: this would be angle AFE, which includes angle AFD (133°) and angle DFG (47°) if D is on one side and G on the other. But this is too ambiguous.

Alternatively, if I consider the angles formed by lines through F:

- Line AF (part of BG)
- Line FE (part of CE)
- Line FB (to B)
- Line FC (part of CE)
- Line FD (to D)

This is too many lines. Let me focus on the known angles at F:

- angle AFD = 133° (between AF and FD)
- angle DFG = 47° (between FD and FG)
- angle EFD = 69° (between FE and FD)
- angle BFE = angle1 (between BF and FE)
- angle CFB = angle3 (between CF and FB)

Let me try to add up these angles. Note that angle AFD (133°) and angle DFG (47°) are adjacent, forming a straight line, so they add up to 180°, which we already used.

Angle EFD (69°) is between FE and FD. So at point F, the angle between FE and FD is 69°, and the angle between FD and FG is 47°, and the angle between AF and FD is 133°. 

Let me try to visualize: at point F, lines AF, FD, FG are in a plane. The angle between AF and FD is 133°, and between FD and FG is 47°, totaling 180°, so AF and FG are collinear, which we already knew.

Now, line FE is another line through F, making an angle of 69° with FD. So the angle between FE and FD is 69°, and between FD and FG is 47°, so the angle between FE and FG is 69° + 47° = 116°. 

Now, at point F, the angle between FE and FG is 116°, and there is also angle BFE (angle1) and angle CFB (angle3). Since line CE passes through F, and line CF is part of line CE, the angle between CF and FG is part of the 116°.

But this is getting too abstract. Let me try to calculate the remaining angles.

At point F, the total around is 360°. We have:

- Angle between AF and FD: 133°
- Angle between FD and FG: 47°
- Angle between FE and FD: 69°
- Angle between FE and FB: angle1
- Angle between FB and CF: angle3
- Angle between CF and FG: ?

But this is too messy. Let me focus on the angles involving line FE.

The angle between FE and FD is 69°, and the angle between FE and FB is angle1. If line FB is in a certain direction, and line CF is in another, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, since line CE passes through F, and line CF is part of line CE, the angle between CF and FG is the same as the angle between CE and FG at point F. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's difficult. 

Let me try to use the fact that the sum of angles around point F is 360°. Let's consider the angles we know:

- Angle between AF and FD: 133°
- Angle between FD and FG: 47°
- Angle between FE and FD: 69°
- Angle between FE and FB: angle1
- Angle between FB and CF: angle3
- Angle between CF and FG: let's call it x

But this is too many variables. Let me try to group them.

The angle between AF and FG is 180° (since AF and FG are collinear). The angle between FE and FG is 69° + 47° = 116°, as previously. So the angle between FE and AF is 180° - 116° = 6
