MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have some constraints here. Let me try to visualize it first. The problem says that line LK has a length of 9 units, and line JK has a length of 14 units. Also, lines LJ and LK are perpendicular. Wait, so point L is connected to both J and K? And those two lines are perpendicular. Hmm. So maybe there's a right angle at point L between lines LJ and LK?

Let me sketch this mentally. Let's imagine triangle JLK. Point L is connected to points J and K. The lines LJ and LK are perpendicular, meaning they form a right angle at L. So triangle JLK is a right-angled triangle at L. Wait, but then the sides adjacent to the right angle would be LJ and LK. But wait, the lengths given are for LK (which is 9) and JK (which is 14). Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm interpreting the notation correctly.

The problem states: Equals(LengthOf(Line(L, K)), 9). So the length from L to K is 9. Then Equals(LengthOf(Line(J, K)), 14). So the length from J to K is 14. Also, Perpendicular(Line(L, J), Line(L, K)). So line LJ is perpendicular to line LK. Therefore, at point L, lines LJ and LK meet at a right angle. That makes triangle JLK a right triangle with right angle at L. 

So in triangle JLK, we have legs LJ and LK, and hypotenuse JK. Wait, but the length of LK is given as 9, and JK is given as 14. Wait, but if it's a right triangle, then by Pythagoras theorem, the sum of squares of the legs equals the square of the hypotenuse. But here, the hypotenuse would be JK, since that's opposite the right angle. Wait, but if the right angle is at L, then the hypotenuse is JK. Therefore:

LJ² + LK² = JK²

But we know LK is 9, and JK is 14. Let me plug these numbers in:

LJ² + 9² = 14²  
LJ² + 81 = 196  
LJ² = 196 - 81 = 115  
Therefore, LJ = sqrt(115)

Hmm, okay. Now the question asks for the measure of angle J. So angle at point J in triangle JLK. Let me think about how to find that angle.

In triangle JLK, which is a right triangle at L. So angles at J and K are acute angles. We need angle at J. Let me recall trigonometric ratios. In a right triangle, the tangent of an angle is opposite over adjacent. For angle J, the side opposite to angle J is LK (since angle J is at point J, so opposite side is LK, which is 9 units). The adjacent side would be LJ, which we found as sqrt(115).

Wait, let me confirm. In triangle JLK, angle at J. The sides relative to angle J are:

Opposite side: the side opposite angle J is LK, which is 9.

Adjacent side: the side adjacent to angle J is LJ, which is sqrt(115).

Hypotenuse is JK, which is 14.

Alternatively, perhaps using cosine or sine. Since tan(angle J) = opposite / adjacent = LK / LJ = 9 / sqrt(115). Alternatively, maybe I can compute this ratio and take arctangent.

Alternatively, maybe use sine or cosine. Let me check:

sin(angle J) = opposite / hypotenuse = LK / JK = 9 / 14 ≈ 0.6429

cos(angle J) = adjacent / hypotenuse = LJ / JK = sqrt(115)/14 ≈ ?

But sqrt(115) is approximately sqrt(121)=11, so sqrt(115)≈10.723. Therefore, sqrt(115)/14 ≈ 10.723/14 ≈ 0.766.

Alternatively, tan(angle J) = 9 / sqrt(115). Let me calculate that value numerically.

First, compute sqrt(115):

sqrt(115) ≈ 10.7238

Then 9 divided by that is 9 / 10.7238 ≈ 0.839.

So tan(theta) ≈ 0.839. Then theta is arctan(0.839). Let me compute that.

I remember that tan(40 degrees) is approximately 0.8391. Let me verify:

tan(40°) ≈ 0.8391, yes. So arctan(0.839) is roughly 40 degrees. Hence, angle J is approximately 40 degrees. Which corresponds to answer choice B.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps to ensure I didn't mix up anything.

First, confirming the triangle setup: right-angled at L. Sides LK=9, hypotenuse JK=14. Therefore, the other leg LJ is sqrt(14² - 9²) = sqrt(196 - 81) = sqrt(115). Correct.

For angle at J, which is adjacent to side LJ and opposite to side LK. Therefore, tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent = LK/LJ = 9/sqrt(115). Wait, earlier I thought that was 9 divided by sqrt(115), but when I approximated sqrt(115) as ~10.72, then 9/10.72 ≈ 0.839. However, another way is to compute tan(theta) = 9 / sqrt(115). Let me compute that more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying which sides correspond to which.

Wait, angle J is at vertex J. In triangle JLK, with right angle at L. So, angle J is formed by sides JL and JK. Wait, no. Let me think again. At vertex J, the sides are J to L and J to K. So the angle at J is between sides JL and JK. Wait, but in terms of opposite and adjacent, for angle J, the opposite side is LK (the side opposite angle J), because angle J is at J, so the side opposite is LK. The adjacent side is JL. Because adjacent is the side next to the angle, which is JL. So yes, tan(theta) = opposite / adjacent = LK / JL = 9 / sqrt(115). So that's correct.

So 9 / sqrt(115) ≈ 9 / 10.723 ≈ 0.839. As mentioned before, arctan(0.839) is about 40 degrees. Let me check with exact calculation.

Alternatively, compute the value using a calculator. If I don't have a calculator, but I know that tan(40°) ≈ 0.8391, which matches our approximate value. So angle J is approximately 40 degrees. Thus, answer choice B is correct.

Alternatively, let me check with another method. Suppose I compute sin(theta) = 9/14 ≈ 0.6429. What's arcsin(0.6429)? Let me recall that sin(40°) ≈ 0.6428. Exactly! So sin(theta) = 0.6429, which is very close to sin(40°). Therefore, theta ≈ 40 degrees. So this confirms the same answer. So regardless of whether I use sine or tangent, I get around 40 degrees. Hence, the answer should be B.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. 40 degrees.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of ∠J in the given geometric configuration, we begin by analyzing the structure described:

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Geometry**
We are told:

- $ \text{Length}(LK) = 9 $
- $ \text{Length}(JK) = 14 $
- Lines $ LJ $ and $ LK $ are **perpendicular**, forming a **right angle** at point $ L $

This implies that triangle $ \triangle JLK $ is a **right triangle**, with the right angle at $ L $. The side $ LK $ is one leg, $ LJ $ is the other leg, and $ JK $ is the hypotenuse.

Using the **Pythagorean Theorem**, we can find the missing leg $ LJ $:

$$
LJ^2 + LK^2 = JK^2 \\
LJ^2 + 9^2 = 14^2 \\
LJ^2 + 81 = 196 \\
LJ^2 = 115 \\
LJ = \sqrt{115} \approx 10.723
$$

---

### **Step 2: Identifying the Angle to Find**
We are asked to find the measure of ∠J in triangle $ \triangle JLK $, which lies at vertex $ J $. This means:

- **Opposite Side**: $ LK = 9 $
- **Adjacent Side**: $ LJ \approx 10.723 $
- **Hypotenuse**: $ JK = 14 $

We use the **tangent function** to relate the angle to its opposite and adjacent sides:

$$
\tan(\angle J) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{LK}{LJ} = \frac{9}{\sqrt{115}}
$$

Compute the numerical value:

$$
\frac{9}{\sqrt{115}} \approx \frac{9}{10.723} \approx 0.839
$$

Now find the angle whose tangent is approximately 0.839:

$$
\angle J = \arctan(0.839) \approx 40^\circ
$$

---

### **Step 3: Final Verification via Sine Function**

As an alternative confirmation, use the **sine function**:

$$
\sin(\angle J) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{LK}{JK} = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.6429
$$

Find the angle corresponding to this sine value:

$$
\angle J = \arcsin(0.6429) \approx 40^\circ
$$

Both methods give us the same result.

---

### **Conclusion**
From multiple approaches — using the tangent and sine functions — we consistently find that:

$$
\angle J \approx 40^\circ
$$

Thus, the correct answer is:

$$
\boxed{B}
$$

Final Answer: B
