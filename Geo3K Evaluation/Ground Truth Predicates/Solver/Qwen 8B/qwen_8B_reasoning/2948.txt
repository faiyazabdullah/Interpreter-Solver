MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, we have some geometric constraints here. Let me first parse the information given.

The problem says that AD is perpendicular to BC, and AB is perpendicular to AC. We need to find the length of BC. The answer choices are A to D, with various square roots and numbers. Also, there are some specific constraints mentioned:

- Length of line BD is 5 units.
- Length of line AB is 10 units.
- Point D lies on line CB (so D is somewhere along CB).

Let me sketch a rough diagram mentally. Since AD is perpendicular to BC, and AB is perpendicular to AC, maybe triangle ABC has some right angles? Wait, AB is perpendicular to AC. That would mean angle at A is 90 degrees because AB and AC are two sides meeting at A, so if they're perpendicular, then triangle ABC is right-angled at A. But also, AD is perpendicular to BC. Hmm, so AD is an altitude from A to BC in the right triangle ABC?

Wait, but in a right triangle, the altitude from the right angle to the hypotenuse has some known relations. Let me recall. In a right triangle, the length of the altitude to the hypotenuse is equal to the product of the legs divided by the hypotenuse. Also, the segments into which the altitude divides the hypotenuse are related to the squares of the adjacent sides.

But first, let's confirm the setup. If AB is perpendicular to AC, then triangle ABC is right-angled at A. Therefore, BC is the hypotenuse. Then AD is drawn from A to BC, being perpendicular to it. So AD is the altitude from the right angle to the hypotenuse. 

Given that, perhaps I can use the properties of right triangles here. Also, point D lies on BC, as per the constraint. And BD is given as 5 units. Also, AB is 10 units. Wait, AB is one of the legs of the right triangle. Let me note down variables.

Let me denote:

- Let’s call AB = c = 10 units (but wait, standard notation for right triangles usually uses legs as a and b, hypotenuse as c). Maybe better to assign variables properly.

Since triangle ABC is right-angled at A, then AB and AC are the legs, and BC is the hypotenuse. Let me denote AB = 10, AC = something, say 'b', and BC = hypotenuse, let's call it 'a'.

Then, in a right triangle, the altitude from the right angle to hypotenuse is given by (AB * AC)/BC. Also, the length of BD (which is part of BC) can be found using similar triangles. Alternatively, since AD is the altitude, BD is one segment of BC split by D.

Moreover, there's another relation: in a right triangle, the altitude to hypotenuse squared equals the product of the segments into which it divides the hypotenuse. So AD² = BD * DC. Also, BD + DC = BC.

But we know BD is 5. However, we don't know DC. Also, we might need more relations. But we also know AB is 10. Let me think how to relate these.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinates. Let me set coordinate system to model this.

Let me place point A at the origin (0,0). Since AB is perpendicular to AC, let me take AB along x-axis and AC along y-axis. So:

- Point A: (0, 0)
- Point B: (10, 0), since AB is 10 units.
- Point C: (0, c), where c is the length of AC, which we don't know yet.

Then, BC connects points B (10,0) and C (0,c). The equation of line BC can be determined. Also, point D lies on BC such that AD is perpendicular to BC.

First, let me compute the coordinates of D. Since AD is perpendicular to BC, and D lies on BC.

Let me parametrize BC. The line BC goes from (10,0) to (0,c). Its slope is (c - 0)/(0 - 10) = -c/10. Therefore, the slope of BC is -c/10. Hence, the slope of AD, which is perpendicular to BC, should be the negative reciprocal, i.e., 10/c.

AD passes through A (0,0), so its equation is y = (10/c)x.

Now, point D lies on BC and on AD. Let me find coordinates of D by solving intersection of BC and AD.

Equation of BC: Let me write parametric equations. From point B (10,0) to C (0,c), parametric equations can be expressed as x = 10 - 10t, y = 0 + ct, where t ranges from 0 to 1.

Alternatively, equation of BC: Let me find it. The line passing through (10,0) and (0,c) can be written as:

(x/10) + (y/c) = 1. Multiplying both sides by 10c gives cx + 10y = 10c. Or rearranged as y = (-c/10)x + c.

So equation of BC: y = (-c/10)x + c.

Equation of AD: y = (10/c)x.

Find intersection point D between AD and BC.

Set (10/c)x = (-c/10)x + c.

Multiply both sides by 10c to eliminate denominators:

10c*(10/c)x = 10c*(-c/10)x + 10c*c

Which simplifies to:

100x = -c² x + 10c²

Bring terms with x to left:

100x + c² x = 10c²

x(100 + c²) = 10c²

Therefore,

x = (10c²) / (100 + c²)

Similarly, substitute back into y = (10/c)x:

y = (10/c)*(10c²/(100 + c²)) ) = (100c)/(100 + c²)

Thus, coordinates of D are ((10c²)/(100 + c²), (100c)/(100 + c²))

Now, BD is given as 5 units. Let's compute BD. Coordinates of B are (10, 0), coordinates of D are as above. Let me compute distance between B and D.

BD^2 = [x_D - 10]^2 + [y_D - 0]^2 = [ (10c²/(100 + c²) - 10 ) ]² + [100c/(100 + c²)]²

Compute each term:

First term: x-coordinate difference:

10c²/(100 + c²) - 10 = [10c² - 10(100 + c²)] / (100 + c²) = [10c² - 1000 - 10c²]/denominator = (-1000)/(100 + c²)

Second term: y-coordinate difference is 100c/(100 + c²)

Therefore, BD^2 = [ -1000/(100 + c²) ]² + [100c/(100 + c²)]² = [1000000 + 10000c²]/(100 + c²)^2

Factor numerator:

= 10000(100 + c²)/(100 + c²)^2) = 10000/(100 + c²)

Therefore, BD^2 = 10000/(100 + c²). Given BD is 5, so BD^2 = 25.

Hence:

25 = 10000/(100 + c²)

Multiply both sides by (100 + c²):

25(100 + c²) = 10000

Divide both sides by 25:

100 + c² = 400

Subtract 100:

c² = 300 → c = sqrt(300) = 10*sqrt(3)

So, AC = c = 10√3.

Now, since triangle ABC is right-angled at A, BC can be computed via Pythagoras:

AB² + AC² = BC²

AB = 10, AC = 10√3

So BC² = 10² + (10√3)^2 = 100 + 100*3 = 100 + 300 = 400 → BC = √400 = 20.

Wait, so BC is 20? Then answer choice C is 20. But let me check again.

Wait, but the question says "What is BC?" So according to this calculation, BC is 20. Which is option C.

But let me verify once more. Because sometimes when you do coordinate geometry, you might make errors.

Alternative approach: Using properties of right triangles. In a right triangle, the altitude to hypotenuse is given by (product of legs)/hypotenuse. Also, the segments BD and DC satisfy BD = (AB²)/BC and DC = (AC²)/BC. Because in a right triangle, the length of the projection of AB onto BC is BD = AB² / BC.

Wait, yes. For example, BD = AB² / BC. Let me see. Since in the right triangle, the altitude h = (AB * AC)/BC. Also, BD = (AB²)/BC. Let me check that formula.

Yes, in a right triangle, the length of the segment BD (from B to foot of altitude) is AB² / BC. Similarly DC = AC² / BC.

So BD = AB² / BC → 5 = (10²)/BC → 5 = 100 / BC → BC = 100 / 5 = 20. Exactly! So BC is 20. So answer is C.

This confirms my previous calculation. Thus, the correct answer is C, 20.

But let me check again why the initial coordinate method gave BC as 20. Yes, because in that case, BC was sqrt(AB² + AC²) = sqrt(100 + 300) = sqrt(400)=20. Correct.

Therefore, the answer is C. So Final Answer: C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the length of $ BC $, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration described in the problem.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**

We are told:

- $ AB $ is perpendicular to $ AC $, implying that $ \angle BAC = 90^\circ $.  
- $ AD $ is perpendicular to $ BC $, making $ AD $ the **altitude** from vertex $ A $ to the hypotenuse $ BC $ of the right triangle $ ABC $.
- $ BD = 5 $
- $ AB = 10 $

From this, we deduce that triangle $ ABC $ is a **right triangle**, right-angled at $ A $, with $ AB $ and $ AC $ as the legs, and $ BC $ as the hypotenuse.

Additionally, since $ AD \perp BC $, and point $ D $ lies on line $ BC $, the segment $ BD $ represents a portion of the hypotenuse divided by the altitude.

---

### **Step 2: Use Right Triangle Properties**

In any right triangle, the **length of the altitude** from the right angle to the hypotenuse satisfies the relationship:

$$
\text{Altitude} = \frac{\text{Product of Legs}}{\text{Hypotenuse}}
$$

Also, the segments created on the hypotenuse by the altitude follow the property:

$$
BD = \frac{AB^2}{BC}, \quad DC = \frac{AC^2}{BC}
$$

Using the fact that $ BD = 5 $ and $ AB = 10 $, we apply the formula:

$$
BD = \frac{AB^2}{BC} \Rightarrow 5 = \frac{10^2}{BC}
$$

$$
5 = \frac{100}{BC} \Rightarrow BC = \frac{100}{5} = 20
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

Thus, the length of $ BC $ is:

$$
\boxed{20}
$$

---

### **Final Answer:**  
$$
\text{Final Answer: C}
