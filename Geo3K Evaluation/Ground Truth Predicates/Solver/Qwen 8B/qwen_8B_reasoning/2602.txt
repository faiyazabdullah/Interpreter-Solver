MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, and C. The problem says that angle at point B (angle CBA) is equal to x, and angle at point C (angle ACB) is equal to 2x. Also, line AC is perpendicular to line AB. Wait, no—wait, it says Perpendicular(Line(A,C), Line(A,B)). So that means lines AC and AB are perpendicular. So, line AC is perpendicular to line AB. That would mean that angle at point A between lines AC and AB is 90 degrees. Let me visualize this.

Let me sketch a rough diagram mentally. Points A, B, and C. Since AC is perpendicular to AB, so AB and AC form a right angle at point A. So triangle ABC has a right angle at A? Wait, but then angles at B and C would be... Well, in a triangle, the sum of angles is 180 degrees. But here, angle at A is 90 degrees because AC is perpendicular to AB. Then the other two angles at B and C should add up to 90 degrees. However, according to the problem, angle at B (which I think is angle ABC?) Wait, need to clarify notation.

The angle notation: Angle(C, B, A) refers to the angle at point B between points C, B, A. So, vertex at B, with segments BC and BA. Similarly, Angle(A, C, B) is the angle at point C between points A, C, B. So vertex at C, with segments CA and CB. 

So, in triangle ABC, angle at B is x, angle at C is 2x, and angle at A is 90 degrees because AC is perpendicular to AB. Therefore, the three angles are x, 2x, and 90 degrees. Summing them up: x + 2x + 90 = 180. So 3x + 90 = 180. Subtract 90 from both sides: 3x = 90. Divide by 3: x = 30. So x is 30 degrees. Let me check again.

Wait, angle at A is 90 degrees? Because AC is perpendicular to AB. So AB is one leg, AC is another leg, making angle at A being 90 degrees. Then yes, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at A. Therefore, angles at B and C must add up to 90 degrees. Given angle at B is x, angle at C is 2x. So x + 2x = 90 → 3x=90 → x=30. So answer is C. Which corresponds to option C, 30. Let me check answer choices: C is 30. So Final Answer: C. 

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting which angles are which. Let me confirm once more. The first angle is MeasureOf(Angle(C, B, A)) which is angle at B between C-B-A. So that's angle ABC, which is at point B. Then MeasureOf(Angle(A, C, B)) is angle at C between A-C-B, which is angle ACB. So those are the two non-right angles. So yes, their sum is 90 degrees. Hence x + 2x = 90. So x=30. So answer is C. So the correct answer is C, 30. So the answer is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration described:

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Geometric Constraints**

We are told:
- $ \text{Angle}(C, B, A) = x $
- $ \text{Angle}(A, C, B) = 2x $
- Lines $ \overline{AC} $ and $ \overline{AB} $ are perpendicular.

This implies that triangle $ \triangle ABC $ is a **right triangle** with a right angle at point $ A $. Thus, the angle at vertex $ A $ is $ 90^\circ $.

---

### **Step 2: Labeling the Triangle Angles**

From the angle notation:
- $ \angle ABC = x $ (at point $ B $)
- $ \angle ACB = 2x $ (at point $ C $)

Since the triangle is right-angled at $ A $, the sum of the remaining two angles must be:
$$
\angle ABC + \angle ACB = 90^\circ
$$

Substituting the expressions for these angles:
$$
x + 2x = 90^\circ
$$
$$
3x = 90^\circ
$$
$$
x = 30^\circ
$$

---

### **Step 3: Conclusion**

Thus, the measure of angle $ x $ is $ 30^\circ $, corresponding to **option C**.

---

### **Final Answer: C**  
$$
\boxed{\text{C}}
