MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, we have two similar triangles, triangle ABC and triangle DEF. The question is asking for the length of EH, which is a median of triangle DEF. We're given that BC = 30, BG = 15, and EF = 15. Let me break down what I know.

First, since the triangles are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional. Also, medians in similar triangles should be in the same ratio as their corresponding sides. Wait, but I need to recall exactly how similarity affects medians.

Let me start by recalling that in similar triangles, the ratio of corresponding lengths (sides, medians, altitudes, etc.) is equal to the scale factor between the triangles. So, if I can find the scale factor between triangle ABC and DEF, then I can use it to find EH from BG.

But first, let me note down the given information:

- Triangle ABC ~ Triangle DEF
- BC = 30 (which is a side of ABC)
- BG is a median of ABC, so BG connects vertex B to the midpoint of AC. Given BG = 15
- EF = 15 (which is a side of DEF; since EF corresponds to BC in the similarity)

Wait, hold on. In similar triangles, corresponding sides are in proportion. Let me make sure about the correspondence. The notation says triangle ABC ~ triangle DEF. That usually means that angle A corresponds to angle D, angle B to angle E, and angle C to angle F. Therefore, side AB corresponds to DE, BC corresponds to EF, and AC corresponds to DF.

So, BC corresponds to EF. Given BC = 30 and EF = 15. Therefore, the ratio of similarity from ABC to DEF is EF / BC = 15 / 30 = 1/2. So, triangle DEF is half the size of triangle ABC? Or wait, actually, since ABC is similar to DEF, the ratio would be DEF : ABC. Wait, the order matters here. If ABC ~ DEF, then the ratio of ABC to DEF is BC / EF = 30 / 15 = 2. So the scale factor from ABC to DEF is 1/2. That means each side of DEF is half the corresponding side of ABC.

Therefore, if BG is a median in ABC, then the corresponding median in DEF would be EH, right? Because BG corresponds to EH. Since BG is the median from B to AC in ABC, and EH is the median from E to DF in DEF. Wait, but let me confirm the correspondence again.

Since ABC ~ DEF, the vertices correspond as follows: A→D, B→E, C→F. Therefore, the median from B in ABC (BG) corresponds to the median from E in DEF (EH). So, the ratio between BG and EH should be the same as the ratio of similarity between ABC and DEF.

Earlier, we determined the ratio of similarity from ABC to DEF is 1/2. But wait, when dealing with ratios in similar figures, the ratio of corresponding lengths is the same. So, if ABC is larger than DEF, then the ratio of ABC to DEF is 2:1, meaning that every length in ABC is twice that in DEF.

So, if BG is a median in ABC, then the corresponding median in DEF would be EH. Thus, EH = BG * (ratio of DEF to ABC). Since the ratio of DEF to ABC is 1/2, then EH = BG * 1/2 = 15 * 1/2 = 7.5. So that would be option A.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the direction of the ratio. Let me think again. Suppose the similarity ratio is ABC : DEF = 2 : 1. Then, all sides of ABC are twice those of DEF. Therefore, the median BG in ABC corresponds to the median EH in DEF. Therefore, BG / EH = 2 / 1 => EH = BG / 2 = 15 / 2 = 7.5. So yes, that gives 7.5, which is option A.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this. For example, using coordinates or properties of medians.

Another thought: In a triangle, the length of a median can be related to the sides via the formula. However, since the triangles are similar, perhaps we can use proportions directly.

But given that the triangles are similar, the ratio of the medians should be equal to the ratio of the corresponding sides. Hence, since BC corresponds to EF, which has ratio 1/2, then the medians BG and EH also have the same ratio. Hence, EH = BG * (EF / BC) = 15 * (15 / 30) = 15 * 0.5 = 7.5. Same result.

Alternatively, maybe I need to check if BG is indeed the corresponding median. Let me visualize the triangles. In triangle ABC, BG is a median from B to AC. In triangle DEF, EH is a median from E to DF. Since ABC ~ DEF, then AC corresponds to DF. Therefore, the median from B (in ABC) corresponds to the median from E (in DEF), because B corresponds to E. Therefore, they are corresponding medians, hence their lengths are in the same ratio as the sides.

Thus, the ratio of BG to EH equals the ratio of BC to EF, which is 30 to 15, i.e., 2:1. Therefore, BG / EH = 2 / 1 => EH = BG / 2 = 15 / 2 = 7.5. So that's consistent with earlier reasoning.

Therefore, the answer should be 7.5, which is option A.

Wait, but just to make sure there isn't any trick here. Sometimes problems might involve different types of medians or something else, but in this case, since the triangles are similar and the medians are corresponding, the ratio should hold.

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves more steps. Let me think if there's a possibility that the median BG isn't corresponding directly. Wait, no. Because in similar triangles, all corresponding elements (medians, altitudes, angle bisectors, etc.) are in the same ratio as the sides.

So, for example, if you have two similar triangles, then the ratio of their medians is equal to the ratio of their corresponding sides.

Hence, the calculation seems straightforward. So, unless there's some misunderstanding in the correspondence of the points.

Wait, the problem mentions PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(C, A)) and PointLiesOnLine(H, Line(D, F)). Hmm, does that affect anything?

Wait, maybe the labels of the points are important. Let me parse that. 

PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(C, A)): This means that point G lies on line CA. Similarly, PointLiesOnLine(H, Line(D, F)): point H lies on line DF. But since BG is a median of triangle ABC, then G is the midpoint of AC. Similarly, EH is a median of triangle DEF, so H is the midpoint of DF.

But since the triangles are similar, the positions of these midpoints would correspond accordingly. But I don't think this adds any new information beyond what's already considered in the similarity ratio.

So, the key idea remains that the ratio between BG and EH is the same as the ratio between BC and EF. Therefore, EH = BG × (EF / BC) = 15 × (15 / 30) = 7.5. So, answer A.

I don't see any errors in this reasoning. Let me check once more.

Given ABC ~ DEF with ratio 2:1 (since BC=30, EF=15). Therefore, all corresponding linear measurements in ABC are twice those in DEF. Therefore, the median BG in ABC corresponds to the median EH in DEF. Therefore, EH = BG / 2 = 15 / 2 = 7.5. Yep. So answer A.

The answer choices are A. 7.5, B. 15, C. 22.5, D. 30. So 7.5 is option A. Therefore, Final Answer: A.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the relationship between the two similar triangles $ \triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF $. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding how similarity affects corresponding segments such as medians and sides.

---

### **Step 1: Understanding Similarity Ratio**

We are told:
- $ BC = 30 $
- $ EF = 15 $

Because $ \triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF $, the ratio of corresponding sides is constant. Specifically:

$$
\frac{BC}{EF} = \frac{30}{15} = 2
$$

This tells us that triangle $ \triangle ABC $ is **twice** as large as triangle $ \triangle DEF $. Thus, the **scale factor** from $ \triangle ABC $ to $ \triangle DEF $ is $ \frac{1}{2} $.

---

### **Step 2: Corresponding Medians in Similar Triangles**

Next, we consider the medians:
- $ BG $ is a median of $ \triangle ABC $, connecting vertex $ B $ to the midpoint of side $ AC $.
- $ EH $ is a median of $ \triangle DEF $, connecting vertex $ E $ to the midpoint of side $ DF $.

Because the triangles are similar, and the medians connect corresponding vertices to the midpoints of opposite sides, the **corresponding medians** $ BG $ and $ EH $ will also be in the same ratio as the sides.

That is,

$$
\frac{BG}{EH} = \frac{AB}{DE} = \frac{BC}{EF} = \frac{AC}{DF}
$$

From earlier, this ratio is:

$$
\frac{BG}{EH} = 2
$$

---

### **Step 3: Solving for $ EH $**

We’re given that $ BG = 15 $. Using the above ratio:

$$
\frac{BG}{EH} = 2 \Rightarrow \frac{15}{EH} = 2 \Rightarrow EH = \frac{15}{2} = 7.5
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

The length of the median $ EH $ in triangle $ \triangle DEF $ is $ 7.5 $, which matches answer choice **A**.

$$
\text{Final Answer: A}
