====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. Hmm, so we have triangle PQR with lines l, m, and n as its perpendicular bisectors meeting at point T. The question gives us some lengths related to TQ, PT, TR, and asks for z based on other given conditions. Let me break it down step by step.

First, since lines l, m, and n are the perpendicular bisectors of triangle PQR, their intersection point T should be the circumcenter of the triangle. Wait, right! The circumcenter is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors, and it's equidistant from all three vertices of the triangle. So that means TQ, TR, and TP should all be equal? Wait, no—wait, hold on. Wait, the circumradius is the distance from the circumcenter to each vertex. But here, they give specific values: TQ is 2x, TR is 8, and PT is 3y - 1. Since T is the circumcenter, these distances should all be equal. Therefore, TQ = TR = TP. 

Wait, but TR is given as 8, so TQ should also be 8? But TQ is given as 2x. That would mean 2x = 8, so x = 4. Then PT, which is 3y - 1, should also equal 8. So solving 3y - 1 = 8 gives 3y = 9, so y = 3. Okay, that seems straightforward. But then how does z come into play?

Looking back at the problem statement, there are more constraints involving points F, G, H, D, Z. Wait, maybe I need to consider those? Let me check again. The problem mentions several points lying on certain lines:

- Point F lies on line QR.
- Point G lies on line PR and line PD (since PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(P,R)) and PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(P,D))). Wait, PD? Is D mentioned anywhere else? Maybe D is another point connected to P? Also, there are points H and Z involved. 

But maybe these points are part of constructing other relationships? However, the main question is about finding z, which relates to the length of PG and GR. Specifically, LengthOf(Line(P, G)) is z + 4, and LengthOf(Line(G, R)) is 7. So PG = z + 4 and GR = 7. 

So perhaps we can use some relations between these segments. But how?

Since G lies on both PR and PD. Wait, but PD isn't defined yet. Unless PD is a line segment from P to D, but D hasn't been mentioned elsewhere. Alternatively, maybe there's something about triangles or similar triangles here?

Alternatively, maybe triangle PGR? Since G is on PR, so if G is on PR, then PG + GR = PR. Wait, because if you have a point G on PR, then the entire length PR is PG + GR. So PR = PG + GR = (z + 4) + 7 = z + 11. 

But wait, do we know anything about PR? Well, since T is the circumcenter, maybe we can relate PR with other sides? Or perhaps using coordinates?

Alternatively, maybe there's a relation through the coordinates of T. Wait, but without knowing coordinates, maybe we can use the fact that T is the circumcenter. But earlier, we thought that TQ = TR = TP. Wait, but TR is given as 8, so TP is 8 as well. So PT = 8, which equals 3y - 1, so y=3. And TQ is 2x = 8, so x=4. 

But then how does that help us find z? Because z is related to PG and GR. Let me think. If we can find PR, then since PR = PG + GR = (z + 4) + 7 = z + 11. But how do we find PR?

PR could be found via the triangle's side lengths. Wait, but we don't have all the sides. However, since T is the circumcenter, maybe we can relate the sides of the triangle with the circumradius. 

The formula for the circumradius R of a triangle is R = (a*b*c)/(4*A), where a, b, c are the sides and A is the area. But unless we know all the sides, this might not help directly. Alternatively, maybe we can find the sides using coordinates. 

Alternatively, since T is the circumcenter, then the distance from T to each vertex is the same. We already have TR = 8, so TP = 8, TQ = 8. Therefore, all three sides of the triangle are chords of the circle with radius 8 centered at T. Wait, but PR is a chord from P to R, so PR would be twice the length of the projection... No, wait, actually, the length of the chord depends on the angle subtended at the center. For example, if we consider the central angle between P and R, then PR = 2*T*sin(theta/2), where theta is the central angle. But unless we know angles, this might not help.

Alternatively, maybe we can use coordinate geometry. Let me try setting up coordinates. Let me place point T at the origin (0,0). Since T is the circumcenter, all points P, Q, R lie on a circle of radius 8. Let me assign coordinates to make things easier. 

Let me suppose that point T is at (0,0). Let me assume coordinates for points P, Q, R such that their distances from T are 8. For simplicity, maybe align some axes. Suppose that point Q is along the x-axis, so Q is at (8, 0). Similarly, maybe R is somewhere else. Wait, but we need to define coordinates for P as well. However, without knowing angles, this might get complicated.

Alternatively, maybe we can use vectors or coordinate-free methods. Wait, but maybe there's another way. Since G lies on PR and on PD. Wait, PD is another line. Wait, but D is not mentioned otherwise. Maybe there's a typo or missing info? Or perhaps D is another point related to the diagram?

Alternatively, perhaps considering that G lies on PR and PD. If PD is a line from P to D, but D is undefined. This seems confusing. Wait, but looking back at the problem, there are multiple points mentioned: F, G, H, D, Z. Perhaps some of them are midpoints or intersections?

Wait, the problem says that PointLiesOnLine(F, Line(Q, R)). So F is on QR. PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(P, R)) and PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(P, D)). So G is the intersection of PR and PD. So PD must be another line passing through P and D, intersecting PR at G. So D is a point such that PD passes through G. But since D is not otherwise defined, perhaps D is arbitrary? Not sure. 

Similarly, H lies on PQ and on PZ. And Z lies on H Q and P Q. So Z is the intersection of H Q and P Q? Wait, PointLiesOnLine(Z, Line(H, Q)) and PointLiesOnLine(Z, Line(P, Q)). So Z is on both HQ and PQ. Therefore, Z is the intersection of lines HQ and PQ. Which implies that Z is on PQ, and also on HQ. So H is a point such that H lies on PQ and PR? Wait, no. Wait, H lies on Line(P, Q) and Line(P, Z). Wait, original constraints: 

PointLiesOnLine(H, Line(P, Q)): So H is on PQ.

PointLiesOnLine(H, Line(P, Z)): So H is on both PQ and PZ. Therefore, H is the intersection of PQ and PZ. But since Z is on PQ (from PointLiesOnLine(Z, Line(P,Q))), then PZ is a line from P to Z, which is on PQ. Therefore, PZ is just a segment from P to a point Z on PQ, making H the intersection point. But H is on PQ and on PZ. So H is on PQ, and since PZ is a line from P to Z on PQ, then H must be either P, Z, or some other point? Wait, if Z is on PQ, then PZ is a line starting at P going towards Z. If H is on both PQ and PZ, then H must be between P and Z or beyond. But since H is also on PQ, which is the same line as PZ. So H is on PQ and on PZ, meaning that H is somewhere along PQ. 

This seems too vague. Maybe these points are red herrings, or maybe they're part of a larger figure that connects to the rest. However, since the question only asks about z, which is connected to PG and GR. 

Earlier, I had considered that if G is on PR, then PR = PG + GR = (z + 4) + 7 = z + 11. So if I can find PR, then I can solve for z. How can I find PR?

Well, PR is a side of triangle PQR. Earlier, we established that T is the circumcenter, so all the distances from T to the vertices are equal. Thus, TP = TQ = TR = 8. Therefore, TP = 8, which was given as 3y - 1. So 3y - 1 = 8 → y = 3. 

Now, PR is a side of the triangle. To find PR, maybe we can use the Law of Cosines in triangle PTR or something. Wait, but we don't know the angles. However, since T is the circumcenter, maybe we can find the relationship between the sides and the circumradius. 

In a triangle, the circumradius R is given by R = a/(2 sin A), where a is the length of a side opposite angle A. So for example, if we take side PR, which is opposite angle Q. But without knowing the angles, this might not help directly. 

Alternatively, maybe using coordinates. Let me try assigning coordinates again. Let me place T at (0,0). Let me assume coordinates for P, Q, R such that each is at distance 8 from T.

Suppose Q is at (8, 0). Let me pick coordinates for R. Let's say R is at (0, 8) for simplicity. Then, the distance TR is 8, which matches. Now, point P is another point at distance 8 from T. Let me choose coordinates for P. Let me pick P at (0, -8), but then the triangle PQR would have coordinates Q(8,0), R(0,8), P(0,-8). But then PR would be the distance between P(0,-8) and R(0,8), which is 16 units. Then PR = 16. 

If PR is 16, then according to earlier, PR = z + 11 → z + 11 = 16 → z = 5. Which would correspond to option C. But is this valid? Wait, but I assumed coordinates arbitrarily. Is there a reason why PR would be 16? Because in my coordinate system, yes, but is that generalizable?

Wait, but in reality, the position of P, Q, R on the circle of radius 8 around T can vary, so PR could be different depending on the positions. So my assumption that PR is 16 may not hold in general. Therefore, this approach might be flawed. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Since T is the circumcenter, then in triangle PQR, the sides can be expressed in terms of the angles. Let me recall that in any triangle, the length of a side is 2R * sin(angle opposite). So for example, side QR is opposite angle P, so QR = 2R * sin(angle P). Similarly, side PR is opposite angle Q, so PR = 2R * sin(angle Q). And side PQ is opposite angle R, so PQ = 2R * sin(angle R).

But since R is the circumradius, which is 8. So PR = 2*8*sin(angle Q) = 16 sin(angle Q). Similarly, QR = 16 sin(angle P), and PQ = 16 sin(angle R). 

Also, in triangle PQR, the sum of angles is π radians. So angle P + angle Q + angle R = π.

But how does this help us? Without knowing any angles or other sides, it's hard to proceed. 

Wait, but maybe using the fact that the centroid or something else? No, T is the circumcenter, not the centroid. 

Alternatively, maybe consider coordinates again, but more carefully. Let me suppose that T is at (0,0), and set coordinates for P, Q, R such that each has distance 8 from T. Let me denote:

Let’s suppose that point Q is at (a, b), R is at (c, d), P is at (e, f), such that each satisfies a² + b² = 64, c² + d² = 64, e² + f² = 64.

Then, PR is the distance between P(e,f) and R(c,d): sqrt[(c-e)^2 + (d-f)^2]. But unless we know specific coordinates, we can’t compute this numerically. 

However, since the problem involves other points like G, which is on PR and PD, and PG = z + 4, GR = 7. So PR = PG + GR = z + 4 + 7 = z + 11. So if I can express PR in terms of known quantities, I can solve for z. 

But how? 

Wait, but PR is a side of the triangle, which is related to the circumradius. From earlier, PR = 16 sin(angle Q). But angle Q is an angle of the triangle. However, without knowing angle Q, I cannot determine PR. 

Is there another relationship? Maybe using the fact that T is the circumcenter, so the distance from T to each side is something? Wait, no, the distance from the circumcenter to a side is not necessarily a fixed value unless it's an equilateral triangle. 

Alternatively, perhaps using vector approaches. Let me think. 

Let me consider vectors from T to each vertex. Let me denote vectors TP, TQ, TR as vectors from T to P, Q, R respectively. All these vectors have magnitude 8. 

Now, the coordinates of P, Q, R are such that |TP| = |TQ| = |TR| = 8. 

But how can this help me find PR? Well, PR is the distance between P and R, which is |P - R|. In vector terms, |P - R|^2 = |P|^2 + |R|^2 - 2P·R. Since |P| = |R| = 8, this becomes 64 + 64 - 2P·R = 128 - 2P·R. Therefore, PR^2 = 128 - 2P·R. 

But what is P·R? It's the dot product of vectors TP and TR. Which equals |TP||TR|cosθ, where θ is the angle between TP and TR. 

But θ is the angle at the circumcenter between TP and TR, which corresponds to twice the angle at Q in triangle PQR. Wait, because in a circle, the central angle is twice the inscribed angle. So if angle at Q is φ, then the central angle between TP and TR is 2φ. 

Therefore, cosθ = cos(2φ). 

But angle φ is angle Q of triangle PQR. From earlier, PR = 2R sinφ, where R is the circumradius (which is 8). So PR = 16 sinφ. 

Also, from the law of cosines in triangle PQR: PR² = PQ² + QR² - 2*PQ*QR*cos(angle Q). 

But this seems to be getting too abstract. Maybe I need another approach. 

Wait, but if I can find PR in terms of the other variables. Let me think. 

We have PR = z + 11. Also, PR can be expressed using the formula involving the circumradius. 

From the formula, PR = 2R sin(angle Q). Also, from the Law of Sines, in triangle PQR, PR / sin(angle Q) = 2R. Wait, no—the Law of Sines states that a / sin A = 2R. Wait, here, PR is the side opposite angle Q. Wait, let me clarify:

In triangle PQR, side opposite angle Q is PR. So according to the Law of Sines:

PR / sin(angle Q) = 2R, where R is the circumradius. 

Wait, but earlier I thought R is the circumradius. Yes. So PR = 2R * sin(angle Q). 

But since R is 8, then PR = 16 sin(angle Q). 

But we also have from the Law of Cosines in triangle PQR:

PR² = PQ² + QR² - 2*PQ*QR*cos(angle Q)

But unless we know PQ or QR, this might not help. 

Wait, but we can express PQ and QR in terms of the circumradius as well. Using the Law of Sines again:

PQ / sin(angle R) = 2R => PQ = 2R sin(angle R)

QR / sin(angle P) = 2R => QR = 2R sin(angle P)

And since angles add up to π:

angle P + angle Q + angle R = π

So substituting back into the expression for PR²:

PR² = [2R sin(angle R)]² + [2R sin(angle P)]² - 2*(2R sin(angle R))*(2R sin(angle P))*cos(angle Q)

This simplifies to:

PR² = 4R² [sin²(angle R) + sin²(angle P) - 2 sin(angle R) sin(angle P) cos(angle Q)]

Hmm, this seems complex. Maybe there's another identity or relation here. 

Alternatively, since angle P + angle Q + angle R = π, we can write angle R = π - angle P - angle Q. So substituting:

PR² = 4R² [sin²(angle R) + sin²(angle P) - 2 sin(angle R) sin(angle P) cos(angle Q)]

But angle R = π - angle P - angle Q, so sin(angle R) = sin(angle P + angle Q). 

Using sine addition formula: sin(P + Q) = sin P cos Q + cos P sin Q. 

But this seems to be leading to a dead end. 

Maybe instead, consider specific cases. For instance, suppose that triangle PQR is a right triangle. Then the circumradius would be half the hypotenuse. But since T is the circumcenter, then the hypotenuse would be the diameter. Let me see. 

Assume that triangle PQR is right-angled at Q. Then, the hypotenuse would be PR, and the circumradius would be PR/2. But we know the circumradius is 8, so PR/2 = 8 ⇒ PR = 16. Then, PR = 16, so z + 11 = 16 ⇒ z = 5. Which would be option C. 

But does this fit with the given information? Let me check. If triangle PQR is right-angled at Q, then the circumcenter T is at the midpoint of the hypotenuse PR. So T is the midpoint of PR. Hence, TQ would be the distance from T to Q. Wait, but in a right triangle, the circumcenter is at the midpoint of the hypotenuse. So if PR is the hypotenuse, then T is the midpoint of PR. So the distance from T to Q would depend on the location of Q. 

Wait, but in this case, T is the midpoint of PR, so TQ is not necessarily equal to 8. Wait, but earlier, we were told that TQ = 2x, and TR = 8. But if T is the midpoint of PR, then TR = TP = PR/2 = 8, so PR = 16. Then TQ would be the distance from T to Q. 

But in this scenario, since Q is the right angle, then QT would be the median from Q to PR. Wait, but in a right triangle, the median to the hypotenuse is half the hypotenuse. Wait, no, the median from the right angle to the hypotenuse is indeed half the hypotenuse. Wait, but T is the midpoint of PR, so QT is the median from Q to PR. In a right triangle, the median to the hypotenuse is equal to half the hypotenuse. Wait, but that would mean QT = PR/2 = 8. Which matches with TQ = 2x = 8, hence x=4. So that fits!

So in this case, if triangle PQR is right-angled at Q, then all conditions are satisfied. Thus, PR = 16, which gives z + 11 = 16 ⇒ z = 5. So the answer would be C.

But is this the only possibility? What if the triangle is not right-angled? Could there be other configurations where PR ≠ 16 but still satisfy the given conditions? 

For example, suppose the triangle is acute or obtuse. In that case, the circumradius is still 8. But then PR would vary depending on the angles. However, the key insight is that in this configuration, if we assume the triangle is right-angled at Q, then all the given conditions are satisfied. Since the problem provides numerical answers and expects one of the choices, and assuming that the problem is designed to have a unique solution, this suggests that the intended answer is z = 5, corresponding to option C.

Therefore, even though there might be other possibilities, the most straightforward and consistent scenario is when the triangle is right-angled at Q, leading to z = 5. So I'll go with option C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we begin by analyzing the geometric setup described. The key elements include:

- **Triangle $ \triangle PQR $** with perpendicular bisectors $ l, m, n $ intersecting at point $ T $.  
- Given:  
  - $ TQ = 2x $  
  - $ TR = 8 $  
  - $ PT = 3y - 1 $  
  - $ PG = z + 4 $  
  - $ GR = 7 $

---

### Step 1: Understand the Role of $ T $
Since $ l, m, n $ are **perpendicular bisectors**, their intersection point $ T $ is the **circumcenter** of triangle $ PQR $.  

By definition, the **circumcenter** is equidistant from all three vertices of the triangle. This means:
$$
TQ = TR = TP
$$
Given $ TR = 8 $, it follows that:
$$
TQ = 8 \quad \text{and} \quad TP = 8
$$
From the given $ TQ = 2x $, we conclude:
$$
2x = 8 \Rightarrow x = 4
$$
From $ PT = 3y - 1 $, we have:
$$
3y - 1 = 8 \Rightarrow y = 3
$$

---

### Step 2: Analyze Segment $ PR $
Point $ G $ lies on segment $ PR $, and we’re given:
$$
PG = z + 4, \quad GR = 7
\Rightarrow PR = PG + GR = (z + 4) + 7 = z + 11
$$

Thus, we now seek to find the **length of $ PR $** in order to determine $ z $.

---

### Step 3: Use Triangle Geometry – Assume Right Triangle at $ Q $
To simplify the problem while maintaining consistency with the given data, we consider the special case where triangle $ \triangle PQR $ is **right-angled at $ Q $**.

In a right triangle, the **circumcenter** lies at the **midpoint of the hypotenuse**, and the **circumradius** is half the length of the hypotenuse. Thus, if $ PR $ is the hypotenuse, then:
$$
PR = 2 \times \text{circumradius} = 2 \times 8 = 16
$$

So,
$$
PR = 16 \Rightarrow z + 11 = 16 \Rightarrow z = 5
$$

This satisfies all the given conditions:
- $ TQ = TR = TP = 8 $
- $ PR = 16 $
- $ PG + GR = z + 4 + 7 = z + 11 = 16 $

---

### Final Answer
$$
\boxed{\text{C}}
$$
