MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, first, I need to visualize what's going on here. The problem mentions a circle O with radius 13 inches. There are points C, D, B, and X involved. Let me parse through the given information step by step.

First, the constraints:

- Point X lies on both lines OB and CD. Wait, no—actually, it says PointLiesOnLine(X, Line(O,B)) and PointLiesOnLine(X, Line(C,D)). So point X is the intersection of lines OB and CD. Also, points C, D, and B lie on the circle centered at O with radius 0.0? Wait, that seems odd. Wait, maybe there's a typo? Wait, looking back: "PointLiesOnCircle(C, Circle(O, radius_0_0))". Maybe that's supposed to be radius 13? Or perhaps radius_0_0 refers to some notation? Hmm, but the problem states that the radius of circle O is 13 inches. So maybe the radius_0_0 is a mistake, and they meant radius 13? Because otherwise, if radius_0_0 is something else, like maybe radius 0? But then points C, D, B would be on a circle of radius zero, meaning they are the same as O? That can't make sense. So probably, the radius is 13. Maybe the original problem had a formatting issue. Let me proceed assuming that points C, D, B are on the circle with center O and radius 13 inches. 

Also, given that line OB is perpendicular to line CD, which is 24 inches long. And the measure of arc CD is 134 degrees. We need to find the measure of arc CB.

Wait, let me rephrase the problem to make sure I get it right. 

We have a circle with center O and radius 13 inches. Points C, D, B are on the circumference. The chord CD is 24 inches long. The measure of arc CD (the arc between C and D) is 134 degrees. Also, line OB is perpendicular to chord CD. Then we need to find the measure of arc CB.

But wait, how does point X come into play? The initial constraints mention that X lies on both OB and CD. So X is the intersection point of those two lines. Also, since CD is a chord, and OB is another line passing through O (since B is on the circle, so OB is a radius). But since OB is perpendicular to CD, that suggests that OB is the perpendicular bisector of CD. Therefore, X must be the midpoint of CD? Wait, because if a radius is perpendicular to a chord, it bisects the chord. Therefore, X should be the midpoint of CD. However, since X also lies on OB, which is a radius. So point X is the midpoint of CD and lies along OB. 

So maybe we can use that information. Also, since CD is 24 inches long, its length is 24. Since X is the midpoint, CX = XD = 12 inches. 

Now, since OB is perpendicular to CD, and X is the midpoint, then OX is part of OB. Wait, but O is the center. So OB is a radius; O is the center, so OB is from O to B. But X is on OB. So OX is a segment from O to X, which is somewhere along OB. 

Let me draw a diagram mentally. Let me consider the circle with center O. Chord CD is 24 units long. The line OB is perpendicular to CD at point X. So, triangle OXC is a right triangle, right? Because OB is perpendicular to CD, so angle at X is 90 degrees. Wait, but O is the center, so OC is a radius, length 13 inches. CX is half of CD, which is 12 inches. So in triangle OXC, we have OC = 13, CX = 12, and OX is the distance from O to X along OB. Using Pythagoras, OX^2 + CX^2 = OC^2. So OX^2 + 12^2 = 13^2 → OX^2 = 169 - 144 = 25 → OX = 5 inches. So the distance from O to X is 5 inches. 

Therefore, since X lies on OB, then OB is a radius of length 13 inches, and OX is 5 inches, so XB = OB - OX = 13 - 5 = 8 inches. So the length from X to B is 8 inches. 

But how does this help us find the measure of arc CB?

Well, arcs correspond to central angles. The measure of arc CD is 134 degrees, so the central angle for arc CD is 134 degrees. Let me recall that the central angle corresponding to an arc is equal to the measure of the arc. So angle COD is 134 degrees. 

Since CD is a chord, and we know the length of CD is 24 inches. Alternatively, since we have the length of CD and the radius, we could compute the central angle using trigonometry. Wait, but the problem already gives the measure of arc CD as 134 degrees, so maybe that's redundant? Wait, but maybe the problem is giving that measure of arc CD is 134 degrees, so we don't need to calculate it. 

But our goal is to find the measure of arc CB. Let me think about how points C, D, B relate. 

Since OB is perpendicular to CD at X, and X is the midpoint of CD. Also, since B is a point on the circle. So, considering the positions of these points. Let me imagine the circle, with center O. Let me place coordinates to model this. Suppose O is at (0,0). Let me set up coordinate system such that CD is horizontal. Since OB is perpendicular to CD, so OB is vertical. Let me assume CD is horizontal, so CD is horizontal, and OB is vertical. Let me suppose that X is the midpoint of CD, lying on OB. So, if CD is horizontal, then OB is vertical line passing through X. 

Let me assign coordinates. Let me take X as the origin? Wait, but O is the center. Wait, earlier calculation showed that OX is 5 inches. So if I set up coordinates with O at (0,0), then X is located at (0, k), but since OX is 5 inches, then X is along OB. Wait, but OB is a radius. Let me think again. 

Alternatively, let me take O at (0,0). Let me assume that line CD is horizontal, and line OB is vertical. Since X is the midpoint of CD and lies on OB. Let me define coordinates accordingly. 

Suppose that point X is at (0, y) since it's on OB, which is vertical. Wait, but O is at (0,0). So OB is a vertical line through O. Wait, no—if OB is a radius, then B is a point on the circle, so OB is a radius vector. If OB is perpendicular to CD, which is horizontal, then OB must be vertical. So, if CD is horizontal, then OB is vertical. Therefore, line CD is horizontal, and line OB is vertical. Thus, their intersection X is the midpoint of CD. 

So, let me fix coordinates. Let me set O at (0,0). Let me have CD horizontal, with midpoint X. Since X is on OB, which is vertical. Let me assume that OB is along the positive y-axis. So point B is somewhere on the positive y-axis. Since OB is a radius of length 13, so B is at (0,13). Wait, but then X is on OB. Earlier, we found OX = 5 inches. So if O is at (0,0), then X is at (0,5), because moving up 5 units along OB (which is the y-axis). 

Then, since X is the midpoint of CD, and CD is horizontal. So, coordinates of C and D would be symmetric around X. Let me denote X as (0,5). Then, since CD is horizontal, points C and D will be located at (-a, 5) and (a, 5), respectively, for some a. The length of CD is 2a, so 2a = 24 ⇒ a = 12. Therefore, points C and D are at (-12,5) and (12,5). 

Wait, but then OC is the distance from O(0,0) to C(-12,5): sqrt((-12)^2 + 5^2) = sqrt(144 + 25) = sqrt(169) = 13. Correct, that matches the radius. Similarly for D(12,5). So that works. 

Now, point B is at (0,13), since it's on the y-axis (OB is the y-axis), and radius is 13. Now, we need to find the measure of arc CB. 

So, points C(-12,5), B(0,13), and O(0,0). The arc from C to B. To find the measure of arc CB, we need the central angle ∠COB. 

To find the measure of angle COB, we can compute the angle between vectors OC and OB. 

Vector OC goes from O(0,0) to C(-12,5), so direction vector is (-12,5). Vector OB goes from O(0,0) to B(0,13), direction vector (0,13). 

The angle between vectors OC and OB can be found using the dot product formula:

cosθ = (OC · OB) / (|OC| |OB|)

Compute OC · OB: (-12)(0) + (5)(13) = 0 + 65 = 65

|OC| = 13, |OB| = 13

Thus cosθ = 65 / (13*13) = 65/169 = 5/13 ≈ 0.3846

Then θ = arccos(5/13). Let me compute this value. 

What's arccos(5/13)? Let me think. In a right triangle with adjacent side 5, hypotenuse 13, opposite side 12 (since 5-12-13 triangle). So the reference angle is arctan(12/5). But the angle θ here is the angle between OC and OB. Wait, but in this case, vector OC is pointing to (-12,5), which is in the second quadrant, while vector OB is pointing upwards along the positive y-axis. 

So the angle between them is measured from OC to OB. Let me sketch mentally. From point O, OC is going to (-12,5), which is in the second quadrant (left upper half). OB is straight up along the positive y-axis. So the angle between OC and OB is the angle between the vector pointing to (-12,5) and the positive y-axis. 

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the angle of OC with respect to the x-axis, then subtract from 90 degrees (since OB is along y-axis). 

The angle of OC with respect to x-axis can be found via tanθ = y/x = 5 / (-12). But since the point is in the second quadrant, the actual angle from positive x-axis is π - arctan(5/12). 

But the angle between OC and OB (positive y-axis) is 90 degrees minus the angle between OC and the positive y-axis. Wait, maybe better to use coordinates. 

Alternatively, since we have cosθ = 5/13, so θ = arccos(5/13). Let me calculate this value numerically. 

Calculating arccos(5/13):

Using calculator, 5 divided by 13 is approximately 0.3846. Arccos(0.3846) is roughly... Well, cos(60°) is 0.5, cos(67.38°) is approx 0.3846. Let me check:

cos(60°) = 0.5

cos(67.38°): Let me see, 67.38 degrees. Let me verify:

If θ = arccos(5/13), then sinθ = sqrt(1 - (25/169)) = sqrt(144/169) = 12/13. So, sinθ = 12/13, cosθ=5/13. Therefore, θ is the angle whose sine is 12/13 and cosine is 5/13. Which corresponds to a reference angle of arctan(12/5). 

Wait, but in this case, θ is the angle between OC and OB. Wait, but OC is in the second quadrant. So when we take arccos(5/13), that gives us the angle between OC and the positive x-axis? No, wait, no—the standard arccos returns the angle between the vector and the positive x-axis, but adjusted for the quadrant. Wait, actually, the angle between two vectors is determined based on their directions. 

But in this case, vector OC is pointing to (-12,5), which makes an angle of 180° - arctan(5/12) from the positive x-axis. While vector OB is along the positive y-axis, which is 90° from the positive x-axis. 

So the angle between OC and OB is the difference between those two angles. 

Angle of OC from x-axis: α = π - arctan(5/12)

Angle of OB from x-axis: β = π/2

Therefore, the angle between OC and OB is α - β = π - arctan(5/12) - π/2 = π/2 - arctan(5/12)

Which simplifies to arctan(12/5). Wait, because tan(arctan(12/5)) = 12/5. Wait, let me check:

π/2 - arctan(a) = arctan(1/a) when a > 0. Is that identity correct?

Yes, because if θ = arctan(a), then π/2 - θ = arctan(1/a). For example, tan(π/2 - θ) = cot θ = 1/tan θ = 1/a. 

So, in this case, arctan(12/5) is the angle between OC and OB. Wait, but we had earlier that cosθ = 5/13, where θ was the angle between OC and OB? Wait, no. Wait, earlier, when computing the dot product, we found that the angle between OC and OB is θ where cosθ = 5/13. But according to the previous analysis, that angle is arctan(12/5). Wait, but arctan(12/5) is the angle whose tangent is 12/5. Let me compute cos(arctan(12/5)).

If φ = arctan(12/5), then cosφ = adjacent/hypotenuse. If we imagine a right triangle with opposite side 12, adjacent 5, hypotenuse sqrt(5² + 12²)=13. So cosφ = 5/13. Yes! Therefore, arccos(5/13) equals arctan(12/5). Therefore, θ = arccos(5/13) = arctan(12/5) ≈ ?

So, arctan(12/5) is approximately... Well, 12/5 is 2.4. What's arctan(2.4)?

I know that tan(67.38°) ≈ 2.4. Let me confirm:

tan(60°) = √3 ≈ 1.732

tan(67.38°) ≈ 2.4. Let me check with calculator steps.

Alternatively, since we have that the angle is θ where tanθ = 12/5, and we need to find θ in degrees. Let me approximate:

Since tan(60°) ≈ 1.732, tan(70°) ≈ 2.747. So 12/5 is 2.4, which is between 60° and 70°. Let me compute tan(67°):

tan(67°) ≈ 2.3558...

tan(67.38°) ≈ ?

Let me use linear approximation or remember that in our case, the exact value isn't needed because the problem gives us the measure of arc CD as 134 degrees, and asks for arc CB. Wait, but maybe there's a relationship between arc CB and arc CD?

Wait, but we need to find arc CB. Given that arc CD is 134 degrees. How does arc CB relate to other arcs?

Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that the central angle for arc CB is θ, which we found to be arccos(5/13), which is approximately 67.38 degrees. But the answer choices are A.24, B.33, C.67, D.134. So option C is 67, which is close to 67.38. But why does the problem give arc CD as 134 degrees? Is there a relation?

Wait, maybe my assumption that the angle between OC and OB is θ = arccos(5/13) is wrong. Let me double-check. 

Earlier, I considered the angle between vectors OC and OB. But maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the position of point B. Wait, in my coordinate setup, point B is at (0,13), which is directly above O. But is that necessarily true? Because OB is a radius, and since X is on OB, and OX is 5, then XB is 8. So, if OX is 5, then OB is length 13, so X is 5 units away from O towards B. Therefore, if O is at (0,0), and X is at (0,5), then B is at (0, 5 + 8) = (0,13). So yes, that's correct. 

But then, in this coordinate system, point C is at (-12,5), point B is at (0,13). So the central angle between OC and OB is the angle between OC and OB. As computed before, that angle is arccos(5/13) ≈ 67.38 degrees. So the measure of arc CB would be approximately 67.38 degrees. Looking at the answer choices, option C is 67. So likely, the answer is C. 

But wait, the problem states that the measure of arc CD is 134 degrees. In my calculation, arc CD is 134 degrees. Let me check that. 

In the coordinate system, points C(-12,5) and D(12,5). The central angle COD is the angle between OC and OD. Since points C and D are symmetric over the y-axis. The angle between OC and OD would be twice the angle between OC and the y-axis. Wait, earlier, we found that the angle between OC and the y-axis is arctan(12/5), which is approximately 67.38 degrees. Therefore, the total angle COD would be 2 * 67.38 ≈ 134.76 degrees. Which is very close to the given 134 degrees. This suggests that the slight discrepancy is due to rounding. Hence, the exact value of angle COD is 2 times arccos(5/13). Wait, but how?

Wait, let me calculate angle COD. Points C(-12,5) and D(12,5). The angle between OC and OD is the angle between vectors OC and OD. Since OC is (-12,5) and OD is (12,5). The dot product is (-12)(12) + (5)(5) = -144 + 25 = -119. The magnitudes of OC and OD are both 13. So cos(angle COD) = (-119)/(13*13) = -119/169 ≈ -0.704. Therefore, angle COD is arccos(-119/169). Let me compute that. 

But the problem says that the measure of arc CD is 134 degrees. Let me check if arccos(-119/169) equals 134 degrees. 

Let me compute cos(134°). 134 degrees is in the second quadrant. Cos(134°) = cos(180°−46°) = -cos(46°). Let me compute cos(46°). Approximately, cos(45°) is √2/2 ≈ 0.7071, cos(46°) is slightly less. Let me check using calculator input (pretending I have one). 

Assuming that cos(134°) ≈ -cos(46°) ≈ -0.6946. Whereas -119/169 ≈ -0.704. These are close but not exactly the same. So there's a slight inconsistency here. Why?

Because in reality, the exact value of angle COD depends on the precise values of the coordinates. However, in our coordinate system, we derived points C and D such that CD is 24 inches, and OX is 5 inches. But the problem states that the measure of arc CD is 134 degrees. Therefore, there might be an inconsistency here unless the numbers are chosen such that this holds. 

This suggests that perhaps the coordinates are not exact, and we need to approach this differently. Perhaps using the given arc measure of CD to find the necessary relations. 

Let me try another approach. Let me recall that the length of chord CD is related to the central angle. The formula for chord length is 2r sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle. Here, chord CD is 24 inches, r is 13 inches. So:

CD = 2r sin(θ_CD / 2)  
=> 24 = 2*13*sin(θ_CD / 2)  
=> sin(θ_CD / 2) = 24/(2*13) = 12/13  
Thus, θ_CD / 2 = arcsin(12/13)  
Therefore, θ_CD = 2 arcsin(12/13)  

Given that θ_CD is 134 degrees, let me check if 2 arcsin(12/13) equals 134 degrees. 

Calculate arcsin(12/13). Let me compute arcsin(12/13). Since sin(θ) = 12/13, then θ = arcsin(12/13). Let me find θ in degrees. 

Again, if we have a right triangle with opposite side 12, hypotenuse 13, then adjacent side is 5. So θ = arctan(12/5) ≈ 67.38 degrees. Therefore, 2θ ≈ 134.76 degrees. But the problem states that θ_CD is 134 degrees. So there's a small discrepancy due to rounding. However, since the problem gives θ_CD as 134 degrees, we can accept that as given. 

Now, returning to finding the measure of arc CB. Let me consider triangle OBC. Points O, B, and C. We need the measure of arc CB, which is the central angle ∠COB. 

Earlier, we found that in the coordinate system, the angle between OC and OB is arccos(5/13), which is approximately 67.38 degrees. But since the problem gives arc CD as 134 degrees, which is approximately twice that angle (as shown earlier), this suggests that arc CB is approximately 67.38 degrees, which is closest to option C (67). 

However, let me think again. Another way to approach this is using inscribed angles or other circle theorems. 

Since OB is perpendicular to CD, and X is the midpoint of CD. Also, OX = 5, as calculated before. 

We can consider triangle OXC, which is a right triangle with legs OX = 5, CX = 12, hypotenuse OC = 13. 

Now, let's consider triangle OBC. We know OB = 13, OC = 13, and BC is a chord connecting points B and C. We need to find the measure of arc CB, which is equal to the central angle ∠COB. 

Alternatively, we can find the length of BC and use the chord length formula again. Let me compute BC. 

Coordinates of B: (0,13); coordinates of C: (-12,5). Distance BC is sqrt[ (0 - (-12))^2 + (13 - 5)^2 ] = sqrt[12² + 8²] = sqrt(144 + 64) = sqrt(208) = 4√13 ≈ 14.422 inches. 

Then, chord BC has length 4√13. Using the chord length formula: 

BC = 2r sin(θ_CB / 2)  
Where θ_CB is the measure of arc CB. 

Plugging in values:  
4√13 = 2*13*sin(θ_CB / 2)  
Divide both sides by 2*13:  
sin(θ_CB / 2) = (4√13)/(2*13) = (2√13)/13 = 2/√13 ≈ 0.5547 

Then θ_CB / 2 = arcsin(2/√13)  
So θ_CB = 2 arcsin(2/√13) 

Let me compute this value. First, simplify 2/√13. Rationalizing, it's (2√13)/13 ≈ 2*3.6055/13 ≈ 7.211/13 ≈ 0.5547. 

So arcsin(0.5547) is approximately what? 

Let me recall that sin(33.69°) ≈ 0.5547. Because in a 3-4-5 triangle, the angle opposite 3 is arcsin(3/5)=36.87°, but this is different. Alternatively, if I consider that sin(33.69°) ≈ 0.5547. Let me check:

For example, sin(30°) = 0.5, sin(35°) ≈ 0.5736. So 0.5547 is between 30° and 35°. Let me approximate:

Let’s say θ = 33.69°, which is known as the angle in a 3-4-5 triangle scaled appropriately. Wait, if we have a right triangle with opposite side 2 and hypotenuse √( (2)^2 + (something)^2 ). Wait, maybe not. Anyway, regardless, if we compute θ = 2 arcsin(2/√13), then θ is approximately 2*(33.69°) ≈ 67.38°, which matches our earlier result. 

So the measure of arc CB is approximately 67.38 degrees. Among the answer choices, option C is 67, which is the closest. Therefore, the answer is C. 

But let me cross-validate with another method. Since arc CD measures 134 degrees, and arc CB measures approximately 67.38 degrees. Note that 134° is roughly twice 67.38°, which makes sense since arc CD spans from C to D, which is symmetrically placed relative to the diameter OB. 

Another thought: since OB is perpendicular to CD, then arc CB and arc BD might be related. Wait, since CD is 134 degrees, and OB is perpendicular to CD, which splits CD into two equal parts. But since OB is a radius, and X is the midpoint of CD, then the arc from C to X to D... Not sure. Alternatively, since the central angle for CD is 134 degrees, then the remaining arcs would depend on the position of B. 

But given that the central angle for CB is approximately 67.38 degrees, which is roughly half of 134.76 degrees (the theoretical value without rounding). Since the problem states that arc CD is 134 degrees, which is slightly less than 134.76, implying that the exact value is slightly less than 134.76. Hence, the exact value of arc CB would be slightly less than 67.38 degrees. But since the answer choices don't include a decimal, and option C is 67, which is the closest, it must be option C. 

Therefore, after thorough analysis, the measure of arc CB is approximately 67 degrees, so the correct answer is C.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of arc $ \widehat{CB} $, we begin by analyzing the given geometric configuration involving a circle centered at point $ O $ with radius $ r = 13 $ inches. Key elements include:

- **Chord** $ CD $ of length 24 inches,
- **Radius** $ OB $ is perpendicular to $ CD $,
- **Arc** $ \widehat{CD} $ measures 134°,
- **Point** $ X $ is the intersection of $ OB $ and $ CD $, making it the **midpoint** of chord $ CD $,
- The objective is to find the measure of arc $ \widehat{CB} $.

---

### Step 1: Use Geometry to Determine Triangle Relationships

Let’s denote the circle’s center as $ O $. Since $ OB $ is perpendicular to chord $ CD $ and passes through its midpoint $ X $, triangle $ OXC $ is a right triangle with:

- $ OC = OB = 13 $ (radii),
- $ CX = \frac{CD}{2} = 12 $,
- $ OX = \sqrt{OC^2 - CX^2} = \sqrt{13^2 - 12^2} = \sqrt{169 - 144} = \sqrt{25} = 5 $.

So, $ OX = 5 $, and thus, the full length of $ OB $ is 13, placing point $ B $ vertically aligned with $ O $ at a distance of 13 units.

---

### Step 2: Find Central Angle $ \angle COB $

To find the measure of arc $ \widehat{CB} $, we focus on the central angle $ \angle COB $, which corresponds directly to the arc.

Vectors $ \vec{OC} $ and $ \vec{OB} $ form the angle between radii $ OC $ and $ OB $. Using the **dot product**, we compute:

$$
\cos(\theta) = \frac{\vec{OC} \cdot \vec{OB}}{|\vec{OC}| |\vec{OB}|}
$$

From earlier, we can deduce the components of the vectors:

- $ \vec{OC} = (-12, 5) $
- $ \vec{OB} = (0, 13) $

Dot product:

$$
\vec{OC} \cdot \vec{OB} = (-12)(0) + (5)(13) = 65
$$

Magnitudes:

$$
|\vec{OC}| = \sqrt{(-12)^2 + 5^2} = \sqrt{144 + 25} = \sqrt{169} = 13 \\
|\vec{OB}| = 13
$$

So,

$$
\cos(\theta) = \frac{65}{13 \times 13} = \frac{65}{169} = \frac{5}{13}
$$

Thus,

$$
\theta = \arccos\left(\frac{5}{13}\right)
$$

This angle represents the measure of arc $ \widehat{CB} $, and evaluating it numerically:

$$
\theta \approx \arccos\left(0.3846\right) \approx 67.38^\circ
$$

---

### Step 3: Match with Given Arc Measure $ \widehat{CD} = 134^\circ $

Note that arc $ \widehat{CD} = 134^\circ $ corresponds to the angle between vectors $ \vec{OC} $ and $ \vec{OD} $, which is indeed double the angle between $ \vec{OC} $ and $ \vec{OB} $, as points $ C $ and $ D $ are symmetric about the y-axis (due to the perpendicularity and midpoint condition).

Hence, the arc $ \widehat{CB} $ is approximately **half** of arc $ \widehat{CD} $, confirming the earlier calculation that it is around **67.38°**.

---

### Final Conclusion

Among the given answer choices:

- A. 24 — too low
- B. 33 — too low
- C. 67 — closest match
- D. 134 — matches arc $ \widehat{CD} $, not arc $ \widehat{CB} $

Thus, the best match is **Option C**, as it aligns most closely with the computed angle of arc $ \widehat{CB} $.

---

**Final Answer: C**
