MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have two quadrilaterals here. The first one is Quadrilateral ACBD with area 400, and the second one is EFGH with area 64. They mention that these figures are similar, and we need to find the length x, which is the length of line FG. 

First, I remember that when two figures are similar, their areas are proportional to the square of their corresponding sides. So, if I can find the ratio of their areas, then take the square root, that should give me the ratio of their corresponding sides. Then, since they gave us the area of the first quadrilateral as 400 and the second as 64, maybe I can set up a proportion?

Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure. The problem says "for the pair of similar figures," so the two quadrilaterals are similar. But wait, the problem mentions Line CB has length 40, and Line FG has length x. So, those lines are corresponding sides? Because CB would correspond to FG if they are corresponding parts of the similar quadrilaterals. Wait, but how do I know which sides correspond?

Hmm. Maybe the order of the letters matters. For example, Quadrilateral ACBD – points A, C, B, D. And EFGH – points E, F, G, H. If they're similar, then the order of the vertices should correspond. So, maybe side AC corresponds to EF, CB corresponds to FG, BD corresponds to GH, and DA corresponds to HE? Or perhaps another correspondence? Wait, without seeing the diagram, it's a bit tricky, but maybe the key is that the sides mentioned (CB and FG) are corresponding sides because they are part of the quadrilaterals.

Assuming that CB and FG are corresponding sides of the similar quadrilaterals, then the ratio of their lengths would be equal to the square root of the ratio of their areas. Let me check that again. If two similar figures have areas in the ratio k², then their corresponding sides are in ratio k. Therefore, k = sqrt(area ratio). 

So, Area of ACBD is 400, and area of EFGH is 64. So the ratio of areas is 400/64. Simplifying that, divide numerator and denominator by 16: 25/4. So the ratio of areas is 25/4. Therefore, the ratio of corresponding sides would be sqrt(25/4) = 5/2. 

But wait, which way is it? Is the larger area corresponding to the larger side? Since 400 is bigger than 64, that means the first quadrilateral (ACBD) is larger, so its corresponding sides would be longer. So, if CB is a side of the larger quadrilateral, then FG is a corresponding side of the smaller one. Therefore, the ratio of CB to FG would be 5/2. 

Given that LengthOf(CB) is 40, so 40 / x = 5/2. Solving for x: cross multiply, 5x = 80 → x = 16. 

Looking at the answer choices, option B is 16. That seems right. Let me double-check my steps. 

Wait, but why did I assume that CB and FG are corresponding sides? The problem states that the pair of similar figures are the quadrilaterals ACBD and EFGH. So, the similarity would imply that the order of the vertices determines the corresponding sides. For instance, if ACBD ~ EFGH, then side AC corresponds to EF, CB corresponds to FG, BD corresponds to GH, and DA corresponds to HE. So yes, CB and FG are corresponding sides. Hence, the ratio between them is 5/2, leading to x being 16. 

Alternatively, could there be another correspondence? Like maybe different sides? Suppose the quadrilaterals are not labeled in the same order, but the problem didn't specify. However, since they are similar, the order of the letters should indicate the correspondence. For example, if ACBD is similar to EFGH, then vertex A corresponds to E, C to F, B to G, D to H. Therefore, side AB would correspond to EF, BC to FG, CD to GH, DA to HE. Wait, no, the sides are between consecutive vertices. So the sides of ACBD are AC, CB, BD, DA. Similarly, EFGH has sides EF, FG, GH, HE. So if the quadrilaterals are similar in order, then AC corresponds to EF, CB corresponds to FG, BD corresponds to GH, and DA corresponds to HE. Therefore, CB and FG are corresponding sides. 

Therefore, the ratio of CB to FG is 5/2, so FG = CB * (2/5). Wait, wait! Wait, earlier I said that the ratio of areas is 25/4, meaning that the ratio of the larger to smaller is 25/4. Therefore, the ratio of the sides would be sqrt(25/4)=5/2. So the larger figure (area 400) has sides that are 5/2 times the smaller (area 64). Therefore, CB (from the larger figure) divided by FG (from the smaller) equals 5/2. Therefore, FG = CB * (2/5) = 40*(2/5) = 16. Which matches option B. 

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be B, 16. 

Let me just confirm once more. Suppose the area ratio is 400/64 = 25/4. Then the scale factor is 5/2. So each side of the larger figure is 5/2 times the corresponding side of the smaller. Therefore, if CB is a side of the larger figure, then FG is the corresponding side of the smaller. Thus, CB = (5/2)*FG → FG = CB*(2/5) = 40*(2/5) = 16. Yep, that checks out. 

I think that's solid reasoning. No mistakes detected here. The answer should be B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x = \text{LengthOf}(Line(F, G)) $, we begin by analyzing the relationship between the two similar quadrilaterals:

- **Quadrilateral** $ ACBD $ has an area of 400.
- **Quadrilateral** $ EFGH $ has an area of 64.
- It is stated that the quadrilaterals are **similar**, implying that their corresponding sides are in proportion, and their areas are in the **square of the ratio of their corresponding sides**.

---

### Step 1: Use the Area Ratio to Find Side Ratio

Since the two quadrilaterals are similar, the ratio of their areas is:

$$
\frac{\text{Area}_{ACBD}}{\text{Area}_{EFGH}} = \frac{400}{64} = \frac{25}{4}
$$

This tells us that the ratio of corresponding sides is the **square root** of the area ratio:

$$
\text{Side Ratio} = \sqrt{\frac{25}{4}} = \frac{5}{2}
$$

Thus, every side in quadrilateral $ ACBD $ is $ \frac{5}{2} $ times the corresponding side in quadrilateral $ EFGH $.

---

### Step 2: Determine Corresponding Sides

From the notation:
- Side $ CB $ in quadrilateral $ ACBD $
- Side $ FG $ in quadrilateral $ EFGH $

These are corresponding sides due to the labeling order of the vertices and the fact that both quadrilaterals are similar. This implies:

$$
\frac{\text{LengthOf}(CB)}{\text{LengthOf}(FG)} = \frac{5}{2}
$$

We are given that $ \text{LengthOf}(CB) = 40 $. Substituting into the equation:

$$
\frac{40}{x} = \frac{5}{2}
$$

Cross-multiplying gives:

$$
5x = 80 \Rightarrow x = 16
$$

---

### Final Conclusion

The length of segment $ FG $ is therefore:

$$
\boxed{16}
$$
