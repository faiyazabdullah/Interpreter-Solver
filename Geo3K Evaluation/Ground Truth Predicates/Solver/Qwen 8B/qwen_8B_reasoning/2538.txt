Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. First, I need to visualize the diagram based on the given constraints. Since there are multiple points and angles mentioned, it might help to sketch a rough diagram mentally or maybe jot down notes about each point and their relationships.

Starting with the points and lines:

- Point G lies on both lines AF and EB (since PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(A,F)) and PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(E,B))). So G is the intersection of AF and EB? Wait, but also PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(E,D))? Wait, no—wait, the constraints say:

PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(A,F)), PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(E,B)), then later PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(E,D))? Wait, no. Let me check again.

Wait, the list includes:

PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(A, F))

PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(E, B))

Then:

PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(E, D))

PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(E, D))

So G is on line ED as well? Because PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(E, D)). So G is on ED, which connects E and D. Also, G is on AF and EB. Therefore, G is the intersection point of lines AF, EB, and ED?

Hmm, that suggests that lines AF, EB, and ED all meet at point G. Interesting. Then point B is on line ED as well because PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(E, D)). So B is on ED. Also, B is connected to line FC and line GD? Wait:

PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(F,C)) and PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(G,D)).

So B is on FC and GD. Hmm.

Also, point E is on line GH and BH, since PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(G,H)) and PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(B,H)). Also, PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(B,H)), so G is on BH. And PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(D,H)), PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(D,H)), so D, H, B, E are colinear? Or D, H is a line, and points B and E lie on it? So BDH is a straight line? Or DEH? Wait, since B is on ED (from earlier), so ED is a line containing points E, D, and B? But also, H is on Line(D, H) with B and E? Wait, maybe H is another point such that D-H is a line passing through B and E? Let me try to parse this.

Let me try to note down all these relationships:

Lines and Points:

- Lines involved: AF, EB, ED, FC, GD, BH, GH, etc.

Points:

- A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.

Constraints:

1. G lies on AF and EB and ED.

Therefore, G is the intersection of AF, EB, and ED. So lines AF, EB, ED intersect at G.

Similarly, B lies on ED and FC and GD. So B is on ED, FC, GD. So line FC passes through B, and line GD passes through B.

E lies on GH and BH and DH. So E is on lines GH, BH, DH. So lines GH, BH, DH all pass through E? Or E is on those lines. So E is the intersection of GH, BH, and DH? Wait, PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(G,H)), meaning E is on line GH. Also, PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(B,H)): E is on line BH. And PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(D,H)): E is on line DH. So E is the common point of lines GH, BH, and DH. Therefore, lines BH and DH intersect at E? Wait, but BH and DH would intersect at H? Unless E is somewhere along them. This seems complex.

Alternatively, perhaps H is a point such that D, H, and E are colinear? Since E lies on Line(D, H). So line DH contains E. Similarly, E lies on BH and GH. So E is the intersection of lines BH, GH, and DH. Therefore, lines BH and DH intersect at E, and GH passes through E.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should focus on angles first.

The given angle measures:

Angle(F, B, E) equals angle 2. So ∠FBE = angle 2.

Angle(A, G, B) is 120°, so ∠AGB = 120°.

Angle(B, D, C) is 50°, so ∠BDC = 50°.

Angle(H, E, A) equals angle 5, so ∠HEA = angle 5.

Angle(H, G, A) equals angle 4, so ∠HGA = angle 4.

Angle(D, C, F) is 78°, so ∠DCF = 78°.

Angle(G, F, B) equals angle 3, so ∠GFB = angle 3.

Angle(G, B, C) equals angle 1, so ∠GBC = angle 1.

Angle(F, A, E) is 56°, so ∠FAE = 56°.

Now, we need to find the measure of angle 3 (∠GFB).

First, let's see if we can relate some of these angles using triangle properties, parallel lines, or other theorems.

Since many points are connected through lines, maybe triangles can be formed here.

Let me start by considering triangle AGB. We know that ∠AGB = 120°, and maybe other angles in that triangle could be related to other angles given.

But we need more information about the sides or other angles in that triangle.

Another angle given is ∠FAE = 56°, which is angle at A between F and E. So ∠FAE is part of triangle AFE or something else.

Also, point G is on AF and EB, so line AF has points A-F-G? Or A-G-F? Wait, since G lies on AF, so the order could be A---G---F, or G between A and F. Not sure yet.

But since angle FAE is 56°, which involves points F, A, E. So E is connected to A? Or E is connected via some line?

Wait, E is connected to B, as per earlier. Also, E is connected to D and H.

Let me think about possible triangles involving angle 3, which is ∠GFB. That is, at point F, between points G and B. So triangle GFB. To find ∠GFB, we may need to find other angles in that triangle or use other relations.

Alternatively, maybe there are parallel lines or transversals creating corresponding angles.

Alternatively, maybe considering quadrilaterals or cyclic quadrilaterals.

But without seeing the exact diagram, it's challenging, but let's proceed with the given info.

Let me consider the points and lines again.

Since G lies on AF and EB, and also on ED. So G is the intersection of AF, EB, and ED.

So, line ED passes through G and B (since B is on ED). So line ED goes through E, D, B, and G?

Wait, earlier constraints said:

PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(E,D)): yes, B is on ED.

PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(E,D)): yes, G is on ED. So ED is a line passing through E, D, B, and G. So the order of points on ED could be E---B---D---G, or some permutation. But need to determine.

Also, point B is on FC and GD. So line FC passes through B, and line GD passes through B. So line GD connects G and D, and passes through B. So points G, B, D are colinear? Yes, because B is on line GD.

So line GD connects G and D, passing through B. So the order on GD could be G---B---D, or B between G and D.

Similarly, line FC connects F and C, passing through B. So line FC has points F---B---C, or B between F and C.

Additionally, line ED connects E, D, B, G. So ED passes through E, then D, then B, then G? Or different order? Depending on positions.

But let me try to imagine this.

Assuming that ED is a straight line with E, then D, then B, then G. So E---D---B---G.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe E and G are on opposite sides of D and B.

But regardless, the key is that several lines pass through these points.

Now, looking at the angles:

Given that ∠DCF = 78°, which is angle at D between C and F. So point C is connected to D and F. Since line FC passes through B, as per earlier. So line FC connects F to C, passing through B. Therefore, F---B---C.

So, point C is on line FC beyond B.

Similarly, ∠BDC is 50°, which is angle at D between B and C. So ∠BDC = 50°, which is part of triangle BDC.

In triangle BDC, we have ∠BDC = 50°, and maybe other angles?

If we can find other angles in triangle BDC, maybe we can find some relations.

Also, ∠DCF = 78°, which is angle at D between C and F. So ∠CDF? Wait, ∠DCF is angle at D between C and F. So that would be adjacent to ∠BDC?

Because if you look at point D, with lines DC and DF. If line DF is connected to F, then ∠BDC is between D-B and D-C, while ∠CDF is between D-C and D-F. So depending on the position of F relative to D and B.

But if line FC passes through B, then F, B, C are colinear. Therefore, DF is a line from D to F. So if B is between F and C, then DF is connected to F, which is on the same line as B and C.

Therefore, ∠BDC + ∠CDF = ∠FDC? Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

At point D, the angles around D would include ∠BDC (between B and C) and ∠CDF (between C and F). However, unless there's another line, like DB or something else. Wait, but line ED passes through D, so maybe line DE is connected to D.

Alternatively, since D is connected to E and to C, and to B (as per ED line). So, at point D, we have lines going to E, B, and C.

Therefore, ∠EDB, ∠BDC, and others.

But given that ∠BDC = 50°, and ∠DCF = 78°, which is angle between DC and DF. So if DF is connected to F, which is on line FC, then DF is connected to F, and since F is on line AF, which passes through G.

This is getting quite tangled. Perhaps focusing on specific triangles and using known angles.

Let me consider triangle DFC. In triangle DFC, we have angle at D (∠DCF = 78°), and angle at C? If we can find another angle, we can compute the third.

But maybe we need more info. Alternatively, since line FC passes through B, maybe triangle DBC is related.

Wait, ∠BDC is 50°, which is in triangle DBC. If we can find another angle in that triangle, we can find the third.

But how?

Alternatively, let's consider triangle DGF or something similar. Wait, but need more connections.

Looking back at the angles given:

We have ∠FAE = 56°, which is angle at A between F and E. So points F, A, E form an angle of 56°. Since G is on AF, then AG is part of AF. So maybe triangle AGE or something.

Also, angle at A, between G and B is 120°, which is ∠AGB = 120°. So points A, G, B forming an angle of 120°. So G is connected to A and B.

So, triangle AGB has angle at G equal to 120°, and maybe other angles?

If we can find other angles in triangle AGB, perhaps we can relate them to other parts.

But for that, we need more info. For example, if we can find ∠GAB or ∠ABG.

Alternatively, since G is on AF and EB, and E is connected to A via ∠FAE = 56°, maybe there are some relations here.

Let me try to consider triangle AFG. Wait, but not sure.

Alternatively, since G is on AF and EB, and E is connected to A, maybe there are vertical angles or something.

Wait, ∠FAE is 56°, which is at point A between F and E. Since G is on AF, then AG is a segment of AF. So if we consider line AE, and line AF, they meet at A. So maybe triangle AEG or something?

But without knowing more about the configuration, it's hard to tell.

Perhaps we need to look for supplementary angles or linear pairs.

For instance, if two lines cross, then vertical angles are equal. Or if there are parallel lines, then corresponding angles are equal.

Alternatively, maybe considering the sum of angles around a point.

Let me think about point G. It lies on AF, EB, and ED. So, at point G, there are several lines: AF, EB, ED.

So, the angles around point G would involve those lines.

For example, ∠AGE, ∠AGB, ∠BGE, etc., depending on the arrangement.

But since we know ∠AGB = 120°, which is the angle between GA and GB.

Also, since G is on ED, which passes through B, so line ED passes through G and B. Therefore, line ED passes through E, D, B, and G.

Thus, at point G, line ED continues through B, so the line ED passes through G and extends to B. Hence, the line from G to B is part of ED.

Therefore, at point G, the line GB is part of ED. Also, line GF is part of AF, since G is on AF.

So, at point G, we have two lines: GF (part of AF) and GB (part of ED). The angle between them is ∠FGB. Wait, but we're supposed to find ∠GFB, which is at point F between G and B.

Wait, ∠GFB is at point F, between G and B. So, triangle GFB. To find its measure.

To find ∠GFB, we need information about triangle GFB. If we can find two other angles in that triangle, or relate it to other triangles.

Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines or Cosines if enough sides are known, but since we don't have side lengths, maybe not directly applicable.

Alternatively, looking for other angles that can be connected.

Let me consider triangle FGB. In triangle FGB, we have angle at F (∠GFB), which we want to find, angle at G (∠FG B?), and angle at B (∠GBF). Sum of angles is 180°.

But to find ∠GFB, we need to know either ∠FG B or ∠GBF.

Alternatively, maybe relating it to other angles.

But how?

Let me think about line AF. Since G is on AF, then FG is a segment of AF. So, if we can find angles involving AF and other lines.

Also, ∠FAE is 56°, which is at point A. So, maybe considering triangle AEF or something.

Since E is connected to A (through ∠FAE), and E is connected to B (as per earlier lines).

Wait, E is connected to B via line EB, since G is on EB. So line EB connects E to B, passing through G.

Therefore, at point E, we have lines EA, EB, and EH (since E is on GH and BH and DH).

So, maybe considering triangle EAB or something.

Alternatively, since ∠FAE is 56°, and line EB passes through G, which is on AF. So, maybe there are some vertical angles or something.

Wait, let me consider point A. At point A, we have lines AF and AE. So, ∠FAE is 56°, which is between FA and EA. So, if we can find other angles at A.

Also, angle at A, between G and B is 120°, which is ∠AGB = 120°. Wait, no, that's at point G. Wait, ∠AGB is the angle at G between A and B.

Ah, right. ∠AGB is at point G, between A and B. So, lines GA and GB form that angle.

So, at point G, the lines GA (which is part of AF) and GB (which is part of ED) form a 120° angle.

So, if I consider triangle AGB, which has vertices at A, G, B, with ∠AGB = 120°, and maybe other angles.

But to find other angles in this triangle, we need more info.

But maybe there are other angles related to this triangle.

For example, if we can find ∠GAB or ∠ABG.

Alternatively, considering line AF, which contains G and F. So, if we can find ∠GAF or something.

But ∠FAE is 56°, which is at point A between F and E. So, if we can relate that to other angles at A.

Let me try to imagine point A. From A, there are lines AF (going to F), AE (going to E), and possibly others. Since G is on AF, then AG is part of AF. So, if I consider line AE and line AF meeting at A, forming ∠FAE = 56°. 

Additionally, since G is on AF, then line AG is along AF. So, if we can find some relation between ∠FAE and other angles at A.

Maybe considering triangle AEG? If E is connected to G?

Wait, E is connected to G via line EB, since G is on EB. So, line EG is part of EB. So, at point E, line EG is part of EB, and line EA is another line.

So, at point E, we have lines EA and EB (with G lying on EB), forming ∠AEB. Also, E is connected to D and H, as per previous constraints.

But maybe considering triangle AEB? In triangle AEB, we have ∠AEB, and we know ∠FAE = 56°, which is at A, and ∠AGB = 120°, but not sure.

This seems too vague. Maybe I need to approach this differently.

Let me recall that we need to find ∠3, which is ∠GFB. Let me denote this angle as x.

In triangle GFB, the angles are:

∠GFB = x (what we want),

∠FGB = ?

∠GBF = ?

Sum to 180°.

But to find x, we need to find either of the other two angles.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express ∠FGB or ∠GBF in terms of other known angles.

Let me think about ∠FGB. This is the angle at G between F and B. Since G is on AF and ED, and line GB is part of ED.

So, ∠FGB is the angle between FG (part of AF) and BG (part of ED). Earlier, we were told that ∠AGB = 120°, which is the angle at G between A and B. Since G is on AF, then GA is along AF towards A, and GB is along ED towards B. So, ∠AGB = 120° is the angle between GA and GB.

But ∠FGB is the angle between FG and GB. Since FG is a continuation of GA past G? Wait, no. Wait, G is on AF. So, AF is a line with points A---G---F or A---F---G? Depending on direction.

Assuming that G is between A and F, then FG is the segment from F to G, and GA is from G to A. So, ∠AGB is between GA (towards A) and GB (towards B). Whereas ∠FGB would be the angle at G between FG (towards F) and GB (towards B). 

But since GA and FG are in a straight line (because G is on AF), then ∠AGB and ∠FGB are supplementary. Because GA and FG form a straight line, so the angle between FG and GB is 180° minus ∠AGB.

Wait, if GA and FG are in a straight line, then ∠AGB + ∠FGB = 180°, because they are adjacent angles forming a linear pair.

Yes! Because at point G, the lines GA and GF are in a straight line (since G is on AF). So, the angle between GA and GB (∠AGB) and the angle between GF and GB (∠FGB) add up to 180°.

Therefore, ∠FGB = 180° - ∠AGB = 180° - 120° = 60°.

So, ∠FGB is 60°.

Now, in triangle GFB, we have ∠FGB = 60°, and we need to find ∠GFB (which is angle 3). To do this, we need to find the third angle, which is ∠GBF.

But how?

Let me consider triangle GFB. The three angles are:

∠GFB = x (angle 3)

∠FGB = 60°

∠GBF = y

So, x + 60° + y = 180° => x + y = 120°

So, if we can find y, which is ∠GBF, then we can find x.

What is ∠GBF? It is the angle at B between G and F. So, at point B, between points G and F.

To find ∠GBF, we need to consider the lines at point B: BG, BF, and possibly others.

From earlier constraints, point B is on line ED, FC, and GD.

So, line BG is part of ED (since B is on ED and G is on ED). Line BF is part of FC (since B is on FC). So, at point B, lines BG (along ED) and BF (along FC) form the angle ∠GBF.

So, ∠GBF is the angle at B between G and F. To find this angle, perhaps we can consider triangle BGC or something else?

Wait, but we might need to find other angles at point B.

Also, remember that ∠BDC = 50°, which is at point D between B and C. And ∠DCF = 78°, which is at point D between C and F.

Earlier, I thought about triangle DCF. Let me revisit that.

At point D, we have lines DC and DF. ∠DCF = 78°, and ∠BDC = 50°. These two angles are adjacent at D, forming ∠FDB? Wait, if we consider line DF and DC, and line DB.

Wait, since point B is on line ED, and D is connected to B, so line DB is part of ED. So, at point D, lines DC, DF, and DB are present. 

So, the angles at D are:

Between DC and DB: ∠BDC = 50°

Between DB and DF: let's call it z

And between DF and DC: ∠DCF = 78°

Wait, but those angles around point D should add up to 360° if there are multiple lines, but likely, since we're talking about planar geometry, the sum of angles around a point is 360°, but if we are only considering certain angles...

Wait, actually, if we consider the lines DC, DB, and DF emanating from D, then the angles between them would depend on their arrangement.

However, since ∠BDC = 50° (between DC and DB), and ∠DCF = 78° (between DC and DF), then the angle between DB and DF would be ∠BDF = ∠DCF - ∠BDC if they are on the same side, or ∠BDC + ∠DCF if on opposite sides.

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's ambiguous. However, assuming that points B, D, F are arranged such that ∠BDC and ∠DCF are adjacent, making ∠BDF = ∠BDC + ∠DCF = 50° + 78° = 128°. But that depends on the diagram.

Alternatively, if DF is extending from D in the opposite direction of DB, then the angle between DB and DF would be ∠BDF = 180° - ∠DCF - ∠BDC? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps considering triangle DBC and triangle DFC.

Wait, let's assume that at point D, the lines DC, DB, and DF create angles such that ∠BDC = 50°, ∠DCF = 78°, and ∠BDF = ?

If we consider triangle DBC, we have ∠BDC = 50°, and if we can find another angle, we can find the third.

But how?

Alternatively, considering triangle DFC. In triangle DFC, we have ∠DCF = 78°, and if we can find another angle, we can find the third.

But without more info, it's tricky. However, maybe there's a relationship between lines and angles due to the other constraints.

Wait, line FC passes through B, so line FB is part of FC. So, in triangle DFC, point B lies on FC. So, if we extend line DC, it meets at point B? No, wait, DC is a side of the triangle, and B is on FC.

Alternatively, considering that line FC passes through B, so in triangle DBC, point B is connected to C and D.

Wait, maybe using the fact that line FC passes through B, so we can apply the Law of Sines or something in triangle DBC and DFC.

But I'm stuck here. Let me think of another approach.

Let me go back to triangle GFB. We have ∠FGB = 60°, and we need to find ∠GBF.

If we can find ∠GBF, then we can get ∠GFB.

How to find ∠GBF?

At point B, we have lines BG (along ED), BF (along FC), and maybe others.

Since point B is on ED and FC, and also on GD (as per PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(G,D)).

So, line GD passes through B. So, at point B, we have lines BG (along ED), BF (along FC), and BD (since B is on ED, which includes D).

Wait, ED is a line passing through E, D, B, G. So, line ED passes through B and D. Thus, at point B, line BD is part of ED.

So, at point B, we have lines:

- BG (part of ED, going from B to G)

- BF (part of FC, going from B to F)

- BD (part of ED, going from B to D)

So, the angle between BG and BD is... Well, since BG is part of ED, and BD is also part of ED, they are the same line. Wait, no. Wait, ED is a line passing through E, D, B, G. So, from point B, line ED goes through D and G. So, line BD is from B to D, and line BG is from B to G, which is along the same line ED.

Therefore, at point B, lines BF (along FC) and BD (along ED) form an angle. Which is ∠FBD.

So, ∠FBD is the angle at B between F and D. And since line ED passes through B, and line FC passes through B, the angle between BF and BD is ∠FBD.

So, if we can find ∠FBD, then since ∠GBF is part of that angle?

Wait, ∠GBF is the angle at B between G and F. Since line BG is along ED (from B to G), and line BF is along FC (from B to F). So, ∠GBF is the angle between BG (ED) and BF (FC), which is ∠FBD.

Wait, yes! Because BG is along ED from B to G, and BF is from B to F. So, the angle between BG and BF is the same as the angle between ED (at B) and BF (at B), which is ∠FBD.

So, ∠GBF = ∠FBD.

Now, if we can find ∠FBD, then we can find ∠GBF.

To find ∠FBD, consider triangle FBD or other triangles.

But how?

Let me think about triangle FBD. In triangle FBD, we have angle at B (∠FBD), and possibly other angles.

But to find ∠FBD, we need more info. However, we might relate it to other angles.

Earlier, we had ∠BDC = 50°, which is at D between B and C. Also, ∠DCF = 78°, which is at D between C and F.

As before, if we consider line DF, which connects D to F, and line DC, connecting D to C, then at point D, ∠BDC = 50°, and ∠DCF = 78°, which suggests that ∠BDF = ∠BDC + ∠CDF? Or something like that.

Wait, if we consider that line DF creates an angle with DC at D. Since ∠DCF = 78°, that is, at D between C and F. So, if we imagine line DF extending from D through F, then the angle between DC and DF is 78°, and the angle between DC and DB (which is ∠BDC = 50°) is on the other side.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to draw it mentally.

Imagine point D. From D, there are lines to C, to B, and to F. 

- ∠BDC = 50°: this is the angle between DC and DB.

- ∠DCF = 78°: this is the angle between DC and DF.

So, the lines DB and DF are both originating from D, making angles with DC. So, the angle between DB and DF would be |∠BDC ± ∠DCF|, depending on their orientation.

Assuming that points B and F are on opposite sides of DC, then ∠BDF = ∠BDC + ∠DCF = 50° + 78° = 128°.

Alternatively, if they are on the same side, it would be |78° - 50°| = 28°, but that seems less likely.

But which is it?

If we consider that line DF is extending from D in a direction such that when combined with DC, forms a 78° angle. And line DB forms a 50° angle with DC on the other side. So, the total angle between DB and DF would be 50° + 78° = 128°, which would make sense.

Thus, ∠BDF = 128°.

Now, in triangle BDF, we have ∠BDF = 128°, and we might find other angles.

But what is known about triangle BDF?

Well, we know that line BF is part of FC, which passes through B. But without knowing other angles or sides, it's still unclear.

Wait, but maybe considering triangle DBC and triangle DFC?

Wait, in triangle DBC, we have ∠BDC = 50°, and if we can find other angles, we can find the third.

But how?

Alternatively, if we consider that line DF is connected to F, and we have ∠DCF = 78°, which might relate to triangle DCF.

In triangle DCF, we have ∠DCF = 78°, and if we can find other angles.

But again, without more info.

Wait, but if we consider that line FC passes through B, then in triangle DCF, point B lies on FC. So, maybe applying the Law of Sines in triangles DBC and DCF?

Let me attempt that.

In triangle DBC, we have ∠BDC = 50°, and let's suppose that ∠DBC is some value, and ∠DCB is another.

But without knowing more, it's hard.

Wait, but maybe using the Law of Sines in triangle DCF.

In triangle DCF, ∠DCF = 78°, and if we can find other angles.

But how?

Alternatively, since line FC passes through B, and line DB is part of ED, which we've already considered.

Wait, maybe using the fact that ∠FBD is the angle we need for ∠GBF, which is part of triangle GFB.

Let me recall that in triangle BDF, ∠BDF = 128°, and if we can find other angles.

In triangle BDF, the sum of angles is 180°, so:

∠BDF + ∠DBF + ∠DFB = 180°

We have ∠BDF = 128°, so:

128° + ∠DBF + ∠DFB = 180° → ∠DBF + ∠DFB = 52°

But ∠DBF is ∠FBD, which we denoted earlier as ∠GBF (since ∠GBF = ∠FBD). So ∠GBF + ∠DFB = 52°.

But what is ∠DFB?

∠DFB is the angle at F between D and B. So, in triangle DFB, ∠DFB is at F.

But how to find ∠DFB?

If we can find ∠DFB, then we can find ∠GBF.

But how?

Let me consider triangle DFB. If I can find ∠DFB, which is at F.

But ∠DFB is part of line FC, since F is on line FC, and D is connected to F. So, ∠DFB is the angle at F between D and B.

But B is on FC, so line FB is part of FC. So, ∠DFB is the angle between FD and FB. Since F is on line FC, which passes through B, so FB is just a segment of FC.

So, ∠DFB is the angle at F between D and B, which is essentially ∠DFB = ∠DFC, since B is on FC.

Wait, but ∠DFC is the angle at F between D and C. But we don't have that directly.

However, we do know ∠FAE = 56°, which is at A between F and E.

Is there a way to connect this?

Let me consider triangle AFE. At point F, we have line FA and FE. Wait, but we don't know much about FE.

But we know that line AE makes an angle of 56° with FA at point A.

Alternatively, consider triangle AFE. At point A, ∠FAE = 56°, and at point F, we have ∠AFE, and at point E, ∠AEF. But without more info, it's difficult.

Wait, but if we can relate ∠DFB to other angles.

Let me think about line DF. It connects D to F. And line FB connects F to B. So, ∠DFB is the angle at F between D and B.

But line DF is connected to D, and line FB is connected to B. So, if we can find some relationship between these lines.

Alternatively, considering triangle DFC, where ∠DCF = 78°, and if we can find ∠DFC.

In triangle DFC, the sum of angles is 180°, so:

∠DCF + ∠DFC + ∠FCD = 180°

But we know ∠DCF = 78°, and ∠FCD is the angle at C between F and D. But we don't know that.

Wait, but if we can relate ∠FCD to other angles.

Alternatively, since line FC passes through B, and we might have other triangles involving point C.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, earlier we had ∠GBC = angle 1. Let me recall that.

The constraint says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(G, B, C)), MeasureOf(angle 1)), so ∠GBC = angle 1.

So, ∠GBC is the angle at B between G and C.

Which is part of line BG (which is part of ED) and line BC.

So, at point B, we have lines BG (ED), BF (FC), and BC.

So, ∠GBC is the angle between BG (ED) and BC, which is part of line BC.

But how does this relate to other angles?

Maybe considering triangle GBC. In triangle GBC, we have ∠GBC = angle 1, and maybe other angles.

But without knowing more, it's hard.

Wait, but if we can relate ∠GBC to ∠FBD.

Earlier, we had ∠GBF = ∠FBD, which was part of triangle BDF.

And ∠GBC is another angle at B, between G and C.

But since line BC is connected to C, and line BF is connected to F, which is on line FC. So, if we consider line BC and BF, they are the same line since F is on FC.

Wait, no. Line BF is part of FC, and line BC is from B to C. So, if F is on FC, then line BF is from B to F, and line BC is from B to C. So, if F is between B and C, then ∠FBC is the same as ∠GBC?

Wait, if F is between B and C, then line BF is part of BC. So, ∠GBC would be the angle between BG (ED) and BC. But if F is on BC, then ∠GBC is the same as ∠GBF?

No, because ∠GBF is the angle between BG and BF, whereas ∠GBC is the angle between BG and BC.

If F is between B and C, then ∠GBF is part of ∠GBC. So, ∠GBC = ∠GBF + ∠FBC. But ∠FBC is the angle between FB and BC, which is zero if F is on BC. Wait, if F is on BC, then line BF is the same as line BC, so ∠FBC is zero. So, ∠GBC = ∠GBF.

Wait, that would mean ∠GBC = ∠GBF.

But we have ∠GBC = angle 1, and ∠GBF = ∠FBD, which we were trying to find earlier.

So, if ∠GBC = ∠FBD, then angle 1 = ∠FBD.

But earlier, in triangle BDF, we had ∠DBF + ∠DFB = 52°, where ∠DBF is ∠FBD = angle 1.

So, angle 1 + ∠DFB = 52° → ∠DFB = 52° - angle 1.

But we don't know angle 1.

However, if we can find angle 1, we can find ∠DFB, and hence find ∠GBF = angle 1, leading us to find x = ∠GFB.

Wait, this seems circular. Let me recap:

We have in triangle GFB:

x + 60° + angle 1 = 180° → x = 120° - angle 1.

But we need to find x = ∠GFB (angle 3).

So, if we can find angle 1, we can find x.

How to find angle 1?

Angle 1 is ∠GBC, which is the angle at B between G and C.

To find ∠GBC, we might consider triangle GBC or other triangles.

Let me consider triangle GBC. In triangle GBC, we have ∠GBC = angle 1, and if we can find other angles.

But to find other angles, we need more info.

Alternatively, considering that line GC is connected to G and C. But I don't know where C is located.

Wait, but we have ∠DCF = 78°, which is at D between C and F. And we have ∠BDC = 50°, which is at D between B and C.

Earlier, we assumed that ∠BDF = 128°, leading to ∠DBF + ∠DFB = 52°, with ∠DBF = angle 1.

But if we can find ∠DFB, which is the angle at F between D and B, which is ∠DFB.

But ∠DFB is part of triangle DFB, and if we can relate it to other angles.

Wait, ∠DFB is the angle at F between D and B. This is the same as ∠DFB in triangle DFB.

But how to find ∠DFB?

If we can relate it to ∠FAE = 56°, which is at A between F and E.

Let me think about triangle AFE. At point F, we have line FA and FE. ∠FAE = 56°, which is at A, but not directly helpful.

Alternatively, considering line FE. Since E is on line GH and BH, and G is on line EB.

Wait, this is getting too abstract. Let me try to summarize what I have:

From earlier steps:

In triangle GFB: x = ∠GFB = 120° - angle 1.

If I can find angle 1, I can find x.

Angle 1 is ∠GBC, which is the angle at B between G and C.

If I can find ∠GBC, which is angle 1, then I can find x.

To find ∠GBC, consider triangle GBC. Let's see if we can find other angles in this triangle.

In triangle GBC, we have:

- ∠GBC = angle 1

- ∠BCG = ? 

- ∠BGC = ?

But without knowing other angles, it's tough.

Wait, but maybe ∠BCG is related to other angles.

Wait, ∠BCG is the angle at C between B and G. If we can find this angle, we can use the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°.

Alternatively, considering line CG. Where is point G in relation to C?

G is on ED, and line ED passes through B, D, G. So, if we can find a relationship between C and G.

But I don't have direct info.

Wait, but we have ∠DCF = 78°, which is at D between C and F. And ∠BDC = 50°, which is at D between B and C. As before, if ∠BDF = 128°, then in triangle DFB, ∠DBF + ∠DFB = 52°, with ∠DBF = angle 1.

But ∠DFB is the angle at F between D and B, which is ∠DFB.

If we can find ∠DFB, then we can find angle 1.

But how?

Let me consider line DF. It connects D to F. And at point F, we have line DF and line FB (since F is on FC). So, ∠DFB is the angle at F between D and B.

But line DF is connected to D, and line FB is part of FC. So, ∠DFB is the angle between DF and FB at F.

If we can relate this angle to other angles in the diagram.

Let me consider triangle DFC. In triangle DFC, we have ∠DCF = 78°, and if we can find other angles.

Let me assume that line DF makes some angle with FC at F. But without more info, it's hard.

Wait, but if we consider that line FB is part of FC, then at point F, line FB is along FC. So, ∠DFB is the angle between DF and FC at F.

But ∠DFB is also part of triangle DFC.

Wait, in triangle DFC, the angles are:

At D: ∠DCF = 78°

At F: ∠DFC = ?

At C: ∠FCD = ?

So, ∠DFC + ∠DCF + ∠FCD = 180°.

But ∠DFC is the angle at F between D and C, which is ∠DFC. But we're interested in ∠DFB, which is the angle at F between D and B, where B is on FC. So, if B is on FC, then ∠DFB is part of ∠DFC.

Specifically, ∠DFB = ∠DFC - ∠BFC, if B is between F and C.

Wait, assuming that B is between F and C, then ∠DFB = ∠DFC - ∠DFC? No, let me clarify.

If B is on line FC, then from point F, line FB is part of FC. So, if we have line FD and line FC, then ∠DFB is the angle between FD and FB, which is the same as ∠DFC, because FB is along FC. Wait, no. If B is on FC, then ∠DFB is the angle between FD and FB, which is the same as ∠DFC, since FB is along FC.

Wait, no. If B is on FC, then ∠DFB is the angle between FD and FB, which is the same as ∠DFC, because FB is a segment of FC.

Wait, but that would mean ∠DFB = ∠DFC.

But in that case, in triangle DFC, ∠DFC = ∠DFB = ∠DFB, and we have:

∠DFC + ∠DCF + ∠FCD = 180°

So, ∠DFC = ∠DFB = ?

But we don't know ∠FCD.

But if we can relate ∠FCD to other angles.

Wait, ∠FCD is the angle at C between F and D. Let me think about line CD and CF.

But I don't have direct info about ∠FCD.

However, if we consider triangle CFD, and if we can relate it to other parts.

Alternatively, if we consider line CG. But I don't know where G is in relation to C.

Wait, but we have ∠GBC = angle 1, which is at B between G and C. And line GC is connected to G and C.

But without knowing where G is relative to C, it's hard.

This seems like a dead end. Let me try to recall that we had earlier:

In triangle BDF, ∠DBF + ∠DFB = 52°, and ∠DBF = angle 1.

So, angle 1 + ∠DFB = 52° → ∠DFB = 52° - angle 1.

But also, in triangle DFC, ∠DFC = ∠DFB = 52° - angle 1.

And in triangle DFC, ∠DFC + ∠DCF + ∠FCD = 180°.

So, (52° - angle 1) + 78° + ∠FCD = 180°

→ ∠FCD = 180° - 78° - (52° - angle 1) = 180° - 78° - 52° + angle 1 = 50° + angle 1.

So, ∠FCD = 50° + angle 1.

Now, ∠FCD is the angle at C between F and D.

But how does this help?

Let me consider line CD and line CF. At point C, we have lines CD and CF, forming ∠FCD = 50° + angle 1.

But I don't know anything about other angles at point C.

Wait, but there's another angle given: ∠GBC = angle 1, and ∠GBC is at B between G and C. If we can relate this to other parts.

Let me consider triangle GBC. In triangle GBC, we have:

∠GBC = angle 1,

∠BCG = ?

∠BGC = ?

But if I can relate ∠BCG to ∠FCD.

Wait, line CG is connected to G and C. If I can find ∠BCG.

But ∠BCG is the angle at C between B and G. Which is part of line CB and CG.

But without knowing where G is relative to C, it's hard.

Alternatively, if line CG intersects with other lines, but I don't have info.

Wait, but we have point G on ED and on AF. So, line CG connects C to G.

But I don't know where G is in relation to C.

This seems too indirect. Let me try to think of another approach.

Recall that we have in triangle GFB: x = 120° - angle 1.

If we can find x, or find another equation involving x.

Alternatively, consider that ∠GFB is angle 3, and there might be a way to relate it to other angles.

Wait, let me recall that we have ∠FAE = 56°, which is at A between F and E. And line AE is connected to E, which is on line GH and BH.

Also, line EB passes through G, and ∠AGB = 120°.

Maybe considering triangle AEG or something.

At point A, we have ∠FAE = 56°, and line AG is part of AF.

So, if we consider line AE and line AG (part of AF), they form ∠FAE = 56° at A.

Also, line AG is part of AF, and line AB is not directly known, but line GB is part of ED.

But I don't see a direct connection.

Wait, let me consider triangle AGB, where ∠AGB = 120°, and if I can find other angles.

At point A, we have ∠GAF, which is part of ∠FAE = 56°, since G is on AF.

Wait, ∠GAF is the angle at A between G and F, which is 0° because G is on AF. Wait, no. ∠GAF is the angle at A between G and F, which is 0° because G is on AF. So, that doesn't help.

Wait, but ∠FAE is the angle at A between F and E. Since G is on AF, then line AG is along AF. So, ∠FAE is the angle between AF (which is AG extended) and AE. So, ∠FAE = 56° is the angle between AG and AE at A.

So, in triangle AEG, we have ∠GAE = 56°, and if we can find other angles.

But without knowing other angles or sides, it's not helpful.

But maybe considering that line AE and line EB meet at E, and G is on EB.

So, at point E, we have lines EA, EB, and EH (since E is on GH and BH).

So, ∠AEB is the angle at E between A and B.

But we know ∠FAE = 56°, and line EB passes through G. So, if we can find ∠AEB, it might help.

But how?

Let me consider that at point E, lines EA and EB form ∠AEB. Also, line ED passes through E and G, and line EH passes through E.

But without more info, it's difficult.

At this point, I realize I might be missing a key insight or a simpler relationship.

Let me revisit the earlier equations.

We had in triangle BDF: ∠DBF + ∠DFB = 52°, with ∠DBF = angle 1.

And in triangle DFC: ∠DFC = ∠DFB = 52° - angle 1.

Also, in triangle DFC: ∠DFC + 78° + ∠FCD = 180° → ∠FCD = 50° + angle 1.

Now, let's consider line CD and line CG. If I can relate ∠FCD to ∠GCB or something.

Wait, ∠FCD is at C between F and D, and ∠GBC is at B between G and C.

But I don't see a direct relation.

Wait, but if we consider line CG, which connects C to G, and line CB, which connects C to B.

At point C, we have lines CD, CF, and CG.

So, the angle between CD and CF is ∠DCF = 78°, and the angle between CF and CG is ∠FCG, and the angle between CG and CD is ∠GCD.

But I don't know these angles.

But if we can relate ∠FCG to other angles.

Alternatively, since line CG connects C to G, and G is on ED, which passes through B and D.

So, line CG connects C to G on ED.

But without knowing where G is relative to C, it's hard.

Wait, but if I consider triangle CGD or something.

Alternatively, since ∠GBC = angle 1, and ∠FCD = 50° + angle 1, maybe there's a way to connect these.

Wait, if we consider that line CG divides some angle at C.

But I'm stuck here.

Let me try to assume a value for angle 1 and see if it leads to consistency.

Suppose angle 1 is 52°, then ∠DFB = 52° - 52° = 0°, which is impossible.

If angle 1 is 30°, then ∠DFB = 52° - 30° = 22°, and ∠FCD = 50° + 30° = 80°.

But how does this help?

Alternatively, if angle 1 is 50°, then ∠DFB = 2°, and ∠FCD = 100°.

Still not helpful.

Wait, but if we consider that ∠FCD = 50° + angle 1, and ∠FCD is part of some other triangle.

Let me consider triangle FCD and triangle GBC.

Wait, if we assume that line CG is parallel to some line, but there's no indication of that.

Alternatively, if we consider that ∠FCD = 50° + angle 1, and if there's a way to relate this to ∠GBC = angle 1.

But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, let me try to think about the entire diagram again.

We have several angles given, and we need to find angle 3, which is ∠GFB.

Earlier, we determined that ∠FGB = 60°, and in triangle GFB, x + 60° + angle 1 = 180° → x = 120° - angle 1.

So, if I can find angle 1, I can find x.

But how?

Let me consider that angle 1 is ∠GBC, which is at B between G and C.

If I can find ∠GBC, perhaps by considering triangle GBC and other triangles.

Let me consider line GC, which connects G to C. Let me assume that line GC makes some angle with other lines.

But without knowing where C is, it's hard.

Wait, but we have ∠DCF = 78°, and ∠BDC = 50°, and ∠FCD = 50° + angle 1.

If I can relate ∠FCD to ∠GBC.

Wait, ∠FCD is at C between F and D, and ∠GBC is at B between G and C.

Unless there's some parallelogram or similar triangles, but I don't see it.

Alternatively, if lines GC and BD are parallel, but there's no reason to assume that.

At this point, I think I need to make an assumption or find a different approach.

Let me recall that in the beginning, we had ∠FGB = 60°, and in triangle GFB, x + 60° + angle 1 = 180° → x = 120° - angle 1.

If I can find another equation involving x and angle 1, I can solve for x.

Let me think about other angles.

We have ∠FAE = 56°, which is at A between F and E. And line AE is connected to E, which is on line GH and BH.

Also, line EB passes through G, and ∠AGB = 120°.

Let me consider triangle AGB, where ∠AGB = 120°, and if I can find other angles.

At point A, we have ∠GAF, which is part of ∠FAE = 56°, since G is on AF.

So, ∠GAF = 0°, because G is on AF. Wait, no. ∠GAF is the angle at A between G and F, which is 0° because G is on AF.

Wait, but ∠FAE is the angle at A between F and E. Since G is on AF, then line AG is part of AF, so ∠FAE is the angle between AF (AG) and AE, which is 56°.

So, in triangle AEG, we have ∠GAE = 56°, and if we can find other angles.

But without more info, it's not helpful.

Wait, but if I consider line AE and line EB, which meet at E. At point E, we have lines EA, EB, and EH.

So, ∠AEB is the angle at E between A and B. This angle could be related to other angles.

But how?

Let me consider that at point E, lines EA and EB meet, forming ∠AEB. Also, line ED passes through G, and line EH passes through E.

But without knowing more about the angles at E, it's hard.

But if I can relate ∠AEB to other angles.

Let me consider that line EB passes through G, and line ED passes through G. So, at point E, lines EB and ED meet at G.

Wait, no. Line ED passes through E, D, B, G. So, at point E, line ED extends through D, B, G.

So, at point E, line ED is a straight line passing through D, B, G. And line EA is another line from E to A.

So, at point E, we have lines ED and EA, forming ∠DEA, which is ∠AEB if B is on ED.

Wait, since B is on ED, then ∠AEB is the angle between EA and EB, which is the same as ∠DEA.

So, ∠DEA = ∠AEB.

But I don't know the measure of this angle.

However, we know that ∠FAE = 56°, which is at A between F and E. And line AF passes through G.

So, if I can relate ∠DEA to other angles.

Let me consider triangle AEG and triangle DEG.

But I don't have enough info.

At this point, I'm stuck and need to try a different approach.

Let me recall that we have several angles given, and perhaps the sum of certain angles equals 180° or other values.

For example, ∠AGB = 120°, and ∠FAE = 56°, and ∠GFB is what we need.

Let me try to consider the possibility that angle 3 is 56°, which is option B. But why?

Wait, ∠FAE = 56°, and if there's some isosceles triangle or something.

Alternatively, if ∠GFB is equal to ∠FAE, but why?

Alternatively, if there's a transversal or something.

But without a clear path, it's hard.

Wait, let me go back to the earlier equation: x = 120° - angle 1, and if I can find angle 1.

If I assume that angle 1 is 52°, then x = 68°, which is option D.

Or if angle 1 is 60°, then x = 60°, which is option C.

Alternatively, if angle 1 is 56°, then x = 64°, which isn't an option.

Wait, but let me think about the earlier equation from triangle DFC: ∠FCD = 50° + angle 1.

If I can relate ∠FCD to another angle.

Wait, ∠FCD is the angle at C between F and D. If I can find this angle through other means.

Let me consider line CD and line CF. At point C, these lines form ∠FCD = 50° + angle 1.

But if I can relate this to other parts of the diagram.

Wait, line CF passes through B, and line CD is connected to D. So, if I consider triangle BCD, which has ∠BDC = 50°, and if I can find other angles.

In triangle BCD, we have ∠BDC = 50°, and if we can find ∠BCD or ∠CBD.

But ∠BCD is part of ∠FCD = 50° + angle 1.

Wait, if I assume that ∠BCD is part of ∠FCD.

Since line CF passes through B, then ∠BCD is the angle at C between B and D, which is part of ∠FCD.

So, ∠FCD = ∠BCD + ∠BCF.

But ∠BCF is the angle at C between B and F, which is 0° if F is on BC. Wait, if F is on BC, then ∠BCF is 0°, and ∠FCD = ∠BCD.

But if F is not on BC, then it's different.

Wait, but line FC passes through B, so F is on the extension of BC, or B is between F and C.

Assuming that B is between F and C, then ∠BCD is part of ∠FCD, and ∠BCF is 0°.

So, ∠FCD = ∠BCD.

But ∠BCD is the angle at C between B and D, which is part of triangle BCD.

In triangle BCD, we have ∠BDC = 50°, ∠BCD = ∠FCD = 50° + angle 1, and ∠CBD.

Wait, no. Wait, in triangle BCD, the angles are:

At D: ∠BDC = 50°

At C: ∠BCD = ?

At B: ∠CBD = ?

Sum to 180°.

But if ∠BCD = ∠FCD = 50° + angle 1, then:

50° + ∠BCD + ∠CBD = 180°

→ ∠BCD + ∠CBD = 130°

But ∠BCD = 50° + angle 1, and ∠CBD is the angle at B between C and D.

But ∠CBD is the angle at B between C and D, which is the same as ∠GBD, since line BG is part of ED.

Wait, ∠CBD is the angle at B between C and D, which is ∠CBD.

But line BG is part of ED, and line BD is part of ED, so ∠GBD is 0°, since G and D are on the same line ED.

Wait, no. At point B, line BD is part of ED, and line BG is also part of ED. So, ∠GBD is 0°, because G and D are on the same line through B.

Wait, this suggests that ∠CBD is the angle at B between C and D, which is ∠CBD. Since line BC is connected to C, and line BD is part of ED.

So, ∠CBD is the angle at B between C and D. This is the same as ∠CBG, since line BG is part of ED.

Wait, ∠CBG is the angle at B between C and G, which is ∠GBC = angle 1.

Wait, yes! ∠CBD is the angle at B between C and D, which is ∠CBD. Since line BG is part of ED, and line BC is connected to C, then ∠CBD is the angle between BC and BD, which is the same as ∠GBC = angle 1.

Wait, no. If line BD is part of ED, and line BC is connected to C, then ∠CBD is the angle between BC and BD. Since line BD is part of ED, and line BG is part of ED, so ∠CBD is the angle between BC and BD, which is the same as ∠GBC = angle 1.

Wait, no. If line BD is part of ED, and line BG is part of ED, then ∠CBD is the angle between BC and BD, which is the same as ∠CBG, since G is on ED.

Wait, ∠CBG is the angle at B between C and G, which is ∠GBC = angle 1.

So, ∠CBD = ∠CBG = angle 1.

Therefore, in triangle BCD, we have:

∠BDC = 50°

∠BCD = 50° + angle 1

∠CBD = angle 1

So, sum is 50° + (50° + angle 1) + angle 1 = 100° + 2*angle 1 = 180°

So, 100° + 2*angle 1 = 180° → 2*angle 1 = 80° → angle 1 = 40°.

So, angle 1 is 40°.

Now, recalling that x = 120° - angle 1 = 120° - 40° = 80°.

Wait, but none of the options is 80°. The options are A. 52, B. 56, C. 60, D. 68.

Hmm, this suggests a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, let me check the calculation.

In triangle BCD, we have:

∠BDC = 50°

∠BCD = 50° + angle 1

∠CBD = angle 1

Sum: 50 + (50 + angle 1) + angle 1 = 100 + 2*angle 1 = 180

So, 2*angle 1 = 80 → angle 1 = 40°.

Then x = 120° - angle 1 = 80°, which is not among the options. So, this suggests an error in assumptions.

Where did I go wrong?

Let me re-examine the step where I said ∠BCD = 50° + angle 1.

Earlier, I had in triangle DFC: ∠FCD = 50° + angle 1, and I assumed that ∠FCD = ∠BCD, but this might not be correct.

Let me revisit
