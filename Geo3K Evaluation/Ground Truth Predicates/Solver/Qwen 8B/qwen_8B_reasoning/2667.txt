Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, we need to find the measure of angle DAB in parallelogram ABCD. The given information includes several lengths and angles, as well as some points lying on specific lines. Let me start by recalling properties of parallelograms.

First, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in length and opposite angles are equal. Also, consecutive angles are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. Additionally, the diagonals bisect each other, but I'm not sure if that's directly useful here.

Looking at the given constraints:

- Length of DC is 10. Since ABCD is a parallelogram, DC should be equal to AB. Wait, because in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. So AB equals CD. But wait, the problem says LengthOf(Line(D,C)) is 10. That would mean DC = 10. Therefore, AB should also be 10. However, there's another constraint: LengthOf(Line(B,A)) is 3y - 8. So if AB is 10, then 3y - 8 = 10. Solving for y: 3y = 18 => y = 6. Hmm, so maybe that's something to note.

Also, LengthOf(Line(D,A)) is 13. DA is one of the sides? Wait, in a parallelogram, adjacent sides are DA and AB, right? Wait, ABCD is a parallelogram, so the vertices are connected in order. So sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So DA is one side, which connects D to A. So DA is adjacent to AB. Wait, but DA and BC are opposite sides, so DA should equal BC. Let me check the given LengthOf(Line(B,C)) is 2x + 7. If DA is 13, then BC should also be 13. So 2x + 7 = 13. Then solving for x: 2x = 6 => x = 3. So that gives us values for x and y.

But how does this help with finding angle DAB?

Now, looking at angles. There's MeasureOf(Angle(B,F,C)) = 49 degrees. Point F lies on both line DB and line CA. So point F is the intersection of diagonals? Wait, in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, so their intersection point is the midpoint. So if F is on both DB and CA, then it's the intersection point of the diagonals. In that case, the diagonals intersect at F. 

So, angle BFC is 49 degrees. Also, angle FBA is 20 degrees. And angle ADF is 59 degrees. Wait, angle ADF is given as 59 degrees. Wait, angle at D between A and F? Or angle at F? Wait, the notation MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,A)) is 20 degrees. So angle at B between F and A. So angle FBA is 20 degrees. Similarly, angle ADF is angle at D between A and F. Wait, no, the notation MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,F)) is 59 degrees. So angle at D, with segments AD and DF. So angle ADC? Wait, not necessarily. Because F is on diagonal AC and BD. So maybe triangle AFD has some properties?

Let me try to visualize the diagram. Parallelogram ABCD. Points A, B, C, D arranged such that AB is parallel to CD, AD is parallel to BC. Diagonals AC and BD intersect at point F. So F is the intersection point of diagonals. In a parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other, so AF = FC and BF = FD. 

Given that, angle BFC is 49 degrees. So angle at F between B and C. Since F is the intersection of diagonals, triangles formed by diagonals have certain properties. For example, triangle BFC. Let me consider triangle BFC. We know angle at F is 49 degrees. Also, since diagonals bisect each other, BF = FD and AF = FC. But perhaps using triangle properties here?

Additionally, angle FBA is 20 degrees. So angle at B between F and A. Which is part of triangle FBA. Also, angle ADF is 59 degrees. So angle at D between A and F. Maybe considering triangle AFD?

Our target is to find angle DAB. Let's denote angle DAB as θ. In a parallelogram, angle DAB is equal to angle BCD, and adjacent angles are supplementary. So angle ABC is 180° - θ. 

Alternatively, since diagonals split the angles into two parts. Wait, in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect the angles only if it's a rhombus (all sides equal). But since we don't know if it's a rhombus, we can't assume that. However, maybe we can use triangle properties here.

Let me think about triangle AFB. Since F is the intersection of diagonals, AF = FC and BF = FD. Wait, actually, in a parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other, so AF = FC and BF = FD. So AF = FC implies that triangle AFC is isoceles? Not necessarily unless sides are equal. Wait, no. The diagonals themselves are bisected, so AF = FC and BF = FD. So in triangle AFB, we have sides AF and BF. But without knowing the lengths of the diagonals, maybe we need to use angles.

We know angle FBA is 20 degrees. Let me see. In triangle FBA, angle at B is 20 degrees. What else do we know? If we can find more angles or sides... Alternatively, since ABCD is a parallelogram, AB is parallel to CD, and AD is parallel to BC. So maybe alternate interior angles?

Wait, angle FBA is 20 degrees. Since AB is parallel to DC, and BF is a transversal. Wait, but BF goes from B to F, which is on diagonal BD. Not sure yet. Alternatively, maybe considering triangle BFC. Angle at F is 49 degrees, and maybe other angles?

Wait, let me think again. Let's look at the angles around point F. Since diagonals intersect at F, the vertical angles are equal. So angle BFC is 49 degrees, which means angle AFD is also 49 degrees. Because when two lines cross, vertical angles are equal.

Then, angle ADF is 59 degrees. So in triangle AFD, we have angle at D is 59 degrees, angle at F is 49 degrees. Therefore, the third angle at A (in triangle AFD) would be 180 - 59 - 49 = 72 degrees. Wait, angle at A in triangle AFD is angle FAD. But angle FAD is part of angle DAB. So angle FAD is 72 degrees? Wait, but angle DAB is the entire angle at A. Is angle FAD the same as angle DAB?

Wait, point F is on diagonal AC. So in parallelogram ABCD, diagonal AC splits the angle at A into two angles: angle FAD and angle FAB. Wait, but angle DAB is the total angle at vertex A, which is composed of angle FAD and angle FAB. However, depending on where F is located. Wait, since F is the intersection of diagonals, in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, but they don't necessarily bisect the angles unless it's a rhombus. So angle FAD might not be half of angle DAB. 

But earlier, in triangle AFD, we found angle at A (FAD) is 72 degrees. Wait, if that's true, then angle FAD is 72 degrees. But angle DAB could be different. Unless there's some relation. Wait, but maybe angle FAD is equal to angle DAB? No, because F is inside the parallelogram, so angle FAD is part of angle DAB. Wait, but how?

Wait, let me clarify. At vertex A, the sides are AD and AB. The diagonal AC goes from A to C, so it splits angle DAB into two angles: angle between AD and AF (which is angle FAD), and angle between AF and AB (which is angle FAB). Therefore, angle DAB = angle FAD + angle FAB. 

If we can find these two angles, we can sum them. Now, we know angle FAB is given as 20 degrees. Wait, angle FBA is 20 degrees, not angle FAB. Wait, angle FBA is at point B, between F and A. So angle FBA is part of triangle FBA. Let me try to find relations here.

In triangle FBA, angle at B is 20 degrees. Also, since diagonals bisect each other, AF = FC and BF = FD. But I don't know the actual lengths of the diagonals. However, maybe we can relate angles through triangle properties or using the law of sines or cosines.

Alternatively, let's consider triangle BFC. We know angle at F is 49 degrees. Let me think about the other angles. Since ABCD is a parallelogram, AB is congruent to CD, and AD congruent to BC. Earlier, we found that AB = 10 (since DC = 10) and BC = 13 (since DA = 13). Wait, DA is given as 13. Since DA is congruent to BC, BC = 13. So BC = 13. Also, AB = 10. So in triangle BFC, sides BF and FC are related to the diagonals.

But without knowing the exact lengths of the diagonals, perhaps we need another approach. Let's go back to the triangle AFD. In triangle AFD, angle at D is 59 degrees, angle at F is 49 degrees, so angle at A (FAD) is 72 degrees. So angle FAD = 72 degrees. Then, angle DAB = angle FAD + angle FAB. If we can find angle FAB, then we can get angle DAB.

What is angle FAB? It's the angle at point A between FA and AB. To find this angle, perhaps consider triangle FAB. In triangle FAB, we know angle at B is 20 degrees (angle FBA = 20 degrees). Also, we can find other angles if we can find some side ratios. However, without knowing the lengths of the sides or the diagonals, maybe we need to use the fact that ABCD is a parallelogram.

Since ABCD is a parallelogram, vectors AB and AD define the sides. The diagonals AC and BD intersect at F, so AF = (AC)/2 and BF = (BD)/2. However, without knowing the lengths of diagonals, perhaps we can use coordinates?

Let me try coordinate geometry. Assign coordinates to points to model the parallelogram. Let me place point A at origin (0, 0). Since DA is 13 units long, let me assign coordinates accordingly. Suppose vector AD is along the y-axis for simplicity. Let me suppose point D is at (0, 13). Wait, but then DA would be vertical. But then AB would be horizontal? Wait, but in a general parallelogram, sides can be at any angle. Maybe better to use variables.

Alternatively, set coordinates with A at (0,0), B at (a, 0), D at (0, b), then C would be at (a, b). Then, diagonals AC and BD intersect at F, which would be at ((a/2), (b/2)). 

But given that, let me compute angles. Let me see. The coordinates would make it easier to calculate slopes and hence angles.

But first, we know DA length is 13. DA is from D(0,b) to A(0,0), so its length is sqrt((0)^2 + (b)^2) = |b| = 13. So b = 13. So point D is (0,13).

AB is from A(0,0) to B(a,0), so length AB is |a|. Given that AB = 10 (from earlier calculation, since DC=10 and DC is equal to AB). So a = 10. Thus, coordinates are:

A(0,0), B(10,0), D(0,13), C(10,13).

Now, diagonals AC and BD intersect at F. Coordinates of F: midpoint of AC is ((10+0)/2, (13+0)/2) = (5, 6.5). Similarly, midpoint of BD: B(10,0) and D(0,13), midpoint is (5, 6.5). So F is at (5, 6.5).

Now, we need to verify the given angles. Let's check angle FBA is 20 degrees. Point F is at (5, 6.5), B is at (10,0), and A is at (0,0). So angle at B between points F and A. So angle FBA is the angle between BA and BF.

Vector BA is from B to A: A - B = (-10, 0). Vector BF is from B to F: F - B = (5 - 10, 6.5 - 0) = (-5, 6.5). So angle between vectors BA and BF is angle FBA.

To find this angle, we can use the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (BA · BF) / (|BA| |BF|)

Compute BA · BF: (-10)(-5) + (0)(6.5) = 50 + 0 = 50.

|BA| = sqrt((-10)^2 + 0^2) = 10.

|BF| = sqrt((-5)^2 + 6.5^2) = sqrt(25 + 42.25) = sqrt(67.25) ≈ sqrt(67.25). Let me compute 67.25 = 67 + 1/4 = 269/4. So sqrt(269)/2 ≈ 16.401/2 ≈ 8.2005.

Thus, cos(theta) = 50 / (10 * 8.2005) ≈ 50 / 82.005 ≈ 0.6098. Taking arccos of that gives approximately 52.5 degrees. Wait, but according to the problem statement, angle FBA is supposed to be 20 degrees. This contradicts our assumption. So either my coordinate setup is wrong, or I made a mistake.

Hmm, this suggests that my assumption of placing the parallelogram with AB horizontal and AD vertical may not satisfy the given angle conditions. Because according to this, angle FBA is about 52.5 degrees instead of 20. Hence, my initial coordinate assignment is invalid. So I need to adjust.

This means that the parallelogram isn't a rectangle or a rhombus, and the sides aren't aligned with axes. Therefore, I cannot assume that AB is horizontal and AD is vertical. Instead, I need a more general approach.

Alternative approach: Use vectors or trigonometry with the given angles.

Let me recall that in a parallelogram, the sum of squares of the diagonals equals twice the sum of squares of the sides. But not sure if helpful here.

Alternatively, since we have angles involving point F, which is the intersection of diagonals. Let me focus on triangle FBA and triangle FBC.

Earlier, in triangle AFD, we had angle at D is 59 degrees, angle at F is 49 degrees, giving angle FAD as 72 degrees. Assuming that, then angle FAD is 72 degrees. But how does that relate to angle DAB?

Angle DAB is composed of angle FAD and angle FAB. If I can find angle FAB, then adding it to 72 gives angle DAB.

From earlier, in triangle FBA, angle at B is 20 degrees. Let me attempt to find other angles in triangle FBA. If I can find sides or other angles.

But since ABCD is a parallelogram, AB = 10, BC = 13. Let me denote AB = c = 10, BC = a = 13. Wait, in standard terms, in a parallelogram, adjacent sides are a and b. Let me define AB = CD = 10, BC = AD = 13. So sides are 10 and 13.

The diagonals in a parallelogram satisfy the formula:

AC² + BD² = 2(AB² + BC²)

But I don't know the diagonals' lengths. However, since F is the midpoint of diagonals, AF = (AC)/2 and BF = (BD)/2.

But without knowing the diagonals, maybe I can relate angles using the Law of Sines or Cosines in triangles involving F.

Let me consider triangle FBA. In triangle FBA, we know angle at B is 20 degrees. Let me denote angle FAB as α, angle FBA as 20 degrees, and angle AFB as β. So α + 20 + β = 180. So β = 160 - α.

Similarly, in triangle BFC, angle at F is 49 degrees, angle at B is something, etc. But need more info.

Alternatively, since ABCD is a parallelogram, the diagonals divide it into four triangles. Triangles AFB, BFC, CFD, DFE (wait, maybe not). Anyway, focusing on triangles involving F.

Another idea: Using the fact that in parallelogram ABCD, diagonals bisect each other, so AF = FC and BF = FD. Hence, triangles AFB and CFD are congruent? Not sure.

Wait, in triangle AFB and triangle CFD: AF = CF, BF = DF, and angle at F is common? No, because angle at F in triangle AFB is angle AFB, while in triangle CFD it's angle CFD. These are vertical angles, so equal. Hence, triangles AFB and CFD are congruent by SAS. Therefore, corresponding angles are equal. So angle FAB in triangle AFB equals angle FCD in triangle CFD. Not sure if helpful.

Back to triangle AFD, where angle at D is 59 degrees, angle at F is 49 degrees, leading to angle at A being 72 degrees. If that angle is indeed angle FAD, then angle FAD = 72 degrees. Then angle DAB = angle FAD + angle FAB = 72 + angle FAB. So if I can find angle FAB, which is part of triangle FBA.

In triangle FBA, angle at B is 20 degrees. If I can find another angle or side ratio, I can find angle FAB.

But how? Perhaps using the Law of Sines in triangle FBA.

Law of Sines states that in triangle FBA,

AF / sin(angle FBA) = BF / sin(angle FAB) = AB / sin(angle AFB)

But I don't know AF or BF. However, since F is the intersection of diagonals, AF = (diagonal AC)/2 and BF = (diagonal BD)/2. But without knowing diagonals, this seems stuck.

But maybe relate diagonals via the formula AC² + BD² = 2(AB² + BC²). Let me write that down.

Let’s denote AB = c = 10, BC = a = 13. Then AC² + BD² = 2*(10² + 13²) = 2*(100 + 169) = 2*269 = 538.

But without additional info, not sure.

Alternatively, consider triangle AFD. In triangle AFD, we know angle at D is 59 degrees, angle at F is 49 degrees, angle at A is 72 degrees. Using Law of Sines:

AF / sin(59°) = DF / sin(72°) = AD / sin(49°)

AD is 13. So:

AF = [sin(59°)/sin(49°)] * 13

Similarly, DF = [sin(72°)/sin(49°)] * 13

But since F is the intersection of diagonals, DF = BF (because diagonals bisect each other). Wait, no: in a parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other, so BF = FD. Wait, BD is the diagonal from B to D, so it is bisected at F. So BF = FD. Hence, BF = FD. From above, DF = [sin(72)/sin(49)] * 13. Hence, BF is equal to this value.

Now, going back to triangle FBA. In triangle FBA, we have BF = [sin(72)/sin(49)] * 13, AB = 10, and angle at B is 20 degrees. Can we apply Law of Sines here?

Yes! In triangle FBA:

AB / sin(angle AFB) = BF / sin(angle FAB)

We know AB = 10, BF = [sin(72)/sin(49)] * 13, angle at B is 20 degrees. But angle AFB is angle at F in triangle FBA. Let me denote angle FAB as α. Then angle AFB = 180° - 20° - α.

So:

AB / sin(180 - 20 - α) = BF / sin(α)

Which simplifies to:

AB / sin(160 - α) = BF / sin(α)

Plugging in AB = 10, BF = [sin(72)/sin(49)] * 13.

Let me compute BF numerically. First, compute sin(72°) and sin(49°):

sin(72°) ≈ 0.9511

sin(49°) ≈ 0.7547

So BF ≈ (0.9511 / 0.7547) * 13 ≈ 1.260 * 13 ≈ 16.38

So BF ≈ 16.38

Now, equation becomes:

10 / sin(160 - α) = 16.38 / sin(α)

Cross-multiplying:

10 * sin(α) = 16.38 * sin(160 - α)

Let me expand sin(160 - α). Note that sin(160 - α) = sin(180 - 20 - α) = sin(20 + α)? Wait, no: sin(π - x) = sin(x), so sin(160 - α) = sin(20 + α) ?

Wait, 160 - α = 180 - 20 - α = π - (20 + α) radians? Wait, no. Wait, 160 degrees is 180 - 20, so sin(160 - α) = sin(20 + α) ? Let me check:

Using identity: sin(A - B) = sinA cosB - cosA sinB. Not sure. Alternatively, sin(160 - α) = sin(π - 20 - α) if 160 degrees is π - 20 degrees. Wait, π radians is 180 degrees. So yes, 160 degrees = π - 20 degrees. Hence, sin(160 - α) = sin(π - 20 - α) = sin(20 + α)? Wait, no. Wait, sin(π - x) = sinx. So sin(π - (20 + α)) = sin(20 + α). But here, the argument is π - 20 - α. So sin(π - 20 - α) = sin(20 + α). Wait, not quite. Let me clarify.

Let me denote θ = 20 + α. Then π - θ = π - 20 - α. So sin(π - θ) = sinθ. So sin(π - 20 - α) = sin(20 + α). Therefore, sin(160 - α) = sin(20 + α). Hence, the equation becomes:

10 sinα = 16.38 sin(20 + α)

Let me expand sin(20 + α) using sine addition formula:

sin(20 + α) = sin20 cosα + cos20 sinα

Therefore:

10 sinα = 16.38 [sin20 cosα + cos20 sinα]

Let me plug in approximate values:

sin20 ≈ 0.3420

cos20 ≈ 0.9397

So:

10 sinα = 16.38 [0.3420 cosα + 0.9397 sinα]

Expand RHS:

16.38 * 0.3420 cosα + 16.38 * 0.9397 sinα ≈ 5.593 cosα + 15.384 sinα

So equation becomes:

10 sinα = 5.593 cosα + 15.384 sinα

Bring all terms to left:

10 sinα - 15.384 sinα - 5.593 cosα = 0

Combine like terms:

-5.384 sinα - 5.593 cosα = 0

Multiply both sides by -1:

5.384 sinα + 5.593 cosα = 0

Divide both sides by cosα (assuming cosα ≠ 0):

5.384 tanα + 5.593 = 0

Solving for tanα:

tanα = -5.593 / 5.384 ≈ -1.038

So α ≈ arctan(-1.038). Since α is an angle in a triangle, it must be between 0 and 180 degrees. However, tanα is negative, implying that α is in second quadrant (between 90 and 180 degrees). But in triangle FBA, angle α is angle FAB, which should be acute or obtuse? Let's think.

In triangle FBA, angles are 20 degrees at B, α at A, and β at F. Since the sum is 180, if α were in second quadrant, it would be >90 degrees. Let's check if that makes sense.

Assume α is in second quadrant, say α = 180 - θ, where θ is positive. Then tanα = tan(180 - θ) = -tanθ. So tanα ≈ -1.038 ⇒ tanθ ≈ 1.038 ⇒ θ ≈ 46 degrees. So α ≈ 180 - 46 = 134 degrees. Let's check if this works.

So α ≈ 134 degrees. Then, angle at F in triangle FBA would be 180 - 20 - 134 = 26 degrees. Let me check if this satisfies the previous equation. Plugging α ≈ 134 degrees into the original equation:

Left side: 10 sin(134°) ≈ 10 * sin(180-46) = 10*sin(46) ≈ 10*0.7193 ≈ 7.193

Right side: 16.38 * sin(20 + 134) = 16.38 * sin(154°) = 16.38 * sin(180-26) = 16.38 * sin(26) ≈ 16.38 * 0.4384 ≈ 7.17. Close enough, considering rounding errors. So this suggests α ≈ 134 degrees.

But angle FAB is α ≈ 134 degrees. Wait, but angle FAB is part of angle DAB. Earlier, we had angle FAD = 72 degrees, and angle DAB = angle FAD + angle FAB = 72 + 134 = 206 degrees, which is impossible because angles in a parallelogram are less than 180. Clearly, something is wrong here.

This contradiction indicates an error in assumptions. Where did I go wrong?

Let me retrace. Earlier, I assumed that in triangle AFD, angles are 59°, 49°, and 72°. But how was that determined? The angle at D is given as MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,F)) = 59°, angle at F is 49°, so angle at A (FAD) is 180 - 59 - 49 = 72°. But this assumes that those three angles are part of triangle AFD. Is that correct?

Wait, angle ADF is 59°, which is angle at D between A and F. Angle at F is angle AFD, which is 49°, as given by MeasureOf(Angle(B,F,C)) = 49°, which is angle BFC. Wait, angle BFC is at F between B and C. But angle AFD is vertical to angle BFC, so it's also 49°. So in triangle AFD, angles at D (ADF) = 59°, at F (AFD) = 49°, so angle at A (FAD) = 72°. This seems correct.

But then angle FAD is 72°, which is part of angle DAB. But if angle FAB is 134°, then angle DAB would be 72 + 134 = 206°, which is impossible. Hence, there must be an error in assuming that angle FAB is part of angle DAB in this way. Wait, but why?

Because in a parallelogram, angle DAB is the angle between DA and AB. Point F is on diagonal AC, so from point A, the diagonal goes to C. So angle between DA and AF is angle FAD, and between AF and AB is angle FAB. Therefore, angle DAB = angle FAD + angle FAB. But if angle FAD is 72° and angle FAB is 134°, then it's impossible. Hence, there's a contradiction, suggesting an error in assumptions.

Where is the mistake? Let me reconsider the triangle AFD. Perhaps angle at F is not 49°? Wait, angle BFC is 49°, and angle AFD is vertical to angle BFC, hence also 49°. So that should be correct. Then angle ADF is 59°, so triangle AFD has angles 59°, 49°, and 72°, making angle FAD = 72°. But this leads to inconsistency.

Maybe the error is in assuming that angle FAD is part of angle DAB? Let me double-check. At point A, the sides are AD and AB. The diagonal AC goes from A to C, so it splits the angle DAB into two angles: one between AD and AF (angle FAD), and another between AF and AB (angle FAB). So angle DAB = angle FAD + angle FAB. But if angle FAD is 72°, and angle FAB is something, but if angle FAB comes out as 134°, which would imply angle DAB is 206°, which is impossible, there's a contradiction.

This suggests that somewhere, my assumptions are incorrect. Let me revisit the initial steps.

Earlier, I assumed that in triangle AFD, angle at F is 49°, but is that accurate?

MeasureOf(Angle(B,F,C)) = 49°, which is angle BFC. Since F is the intersection of diagonals, angle BFC is equal to angle AFD because they are vertical angles. So angle AFD = 49°, yes. So that part is correct.

Then angle ADF is given as 59°, so triangle AFD has angles 59°, 49°, and thus 72° at A. This seems correct. But then angle DAB = angle FAD + angle FAB. If angle FAD is 72°, and angle FAB is something, but angle FAB came out to be 134°, which is impossible. Hence, there must be an error in calculating angle FAB.

Let me re-examine the calculation where I used Law of Sines in triangle FBA.

I had:

10 sinα = 16.38 sin(20 + α)

And solved for α, getting α ≈ 134°. But this led to inconsistency. Perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation.

Let me re-derive the equation.

In triangle FBA:

AB / sin(angle AFB) = BF / sin(angle FAB)

Angle AFB = 180° - angle FBA - angle FAB = 180° - 20° - α = 160° - α.

So:

AB / sin(160° - α) = BF / sinα

Which is:

10 / sin(160 - α) = BF / sinα

But BF was computed as [sin(72°)/sin(49°)] * 13 ≈ 16.38.

But maybe this BF is incorrect? Let me re-calculate BF.

In triangle AFD, using Law of Sines:

AF / sin(angle ADF) = AD / sin(angle AFD)

So AF = [sin(angle ADF)/sin(angle AFD)] * AD

Angle ADF is 59°, angle AFD is 49°, AD is 13.

So AF = [sin(59)/sin(49)] * 13 ≈ [0.8572 / 0.7547] * 13 ≈ 1.136 * 13 ≈ 14.768

Wait, previously I said BF = DF, which is equal to [sin(72)/sin(49)] * 13, but this seems incorrect. Let me redo this.

In triangle AFD, applying Law of Sines:

AD / sin(angle AFD) = DF / sin(angle FAD) = AF / sin(angle ADF)

So DF = [sin(angle FAD)/sin(angle AFD)] * AD

Angle FAD is 72°, angle AFD is 49°, AD is 13.

So DF = [sin(72)/sin(49)] * 13 ≈ [0.9511 / 0.7547] * 13 ≈ 1.260 * 13 ≈ 16.38

But DF is equal to BF, since diagonals bisect each other. So BF = DF ≈ 16.38.

So that part is correct. So BF is indeed ≈ 16.38.

So the equation remains: 10/sin(160 - α) = 16.38/sinα

Which gave us α ≈ 134°, leading to inconsistency.

Perhaps the issue is that angle FAB is not part of angle DAB? Wait, how? At point A, the angle between DA and AB is DAB. The diagonal AC divides this angle into FAD and FAB. So angle DAB = FAD + FAB. If FAD is 72°, and FAB is 134°, then DAB would be 206°, which is impossible. So this suggests that there's a fundamental error in the assumption that angle AFD is 49°.

Wait, let's re-express the problem. Maybe angle AFD is not 49°? Let me think. Angle BFC is 49°, and since F is the intersection of diagonals, angle AFD is vertical to angle BFC, so it should also be 49°. Hence, angle AFD = 49°. So that part is correct.

Wait, but if in triangle AFD, angle at F is 49°, angle at D is 59°, then angle at A is 72°. But if that angle at A is part of angle DAB, and angle FAB is part of it, then angle DAB = 72 + angle FAB. But angle FAB is derived as 134°, which is impossible. Hence, the only possibility is that my calculation of angle FAB is wrong.

Wait, let me try solving the equation again: 10 sinα = 16.38 sin(20 + α)

Let me try plugging in α = 20°. Left: 10 sin20 ≈ 10 * 0.3420 = 3.42. Right: 16.38 sin(40) ≈ 16.38 * 0.6428 ≈ 10.53. Not equal.

Try α = 30°: Left: 10 * 0.5 = 5. Right: 16.38 * sin(50) ≈ 16.38 * 0.7660 ≈ 12.55. Still not close.

Try α = 40°: Left: 10 * sin40 ≈ 6.43. Right: 16.38 * sin(60) ≈ 16.38 * 0.8660 ≈ 14.17. Still not matching.

Try α = 50°: Left: 10 * sin50 ≈ 8.0. Right: 16.38 * sin(70) ≈ 16.38 * 0.9397 ≈ 15.38. Closer, but still not equal.

Try α = 60°: Left: 10 * sin60 ≈ 8.66. Right: 16.38 * sin(80) ≈ 16.38 * 0.9848 ≈ 16.12. Still not matching.

Wait, when α = 134°, as before, left side: 10 sin(134) ≈ 10 * sin(46) ≈ 7.19. Right side: 16.38 * sin(154) ≈ 16.38 * sin(26) ≈ 16.38 * 0.4384 ≈ 7.17. So it's very close. So this suggests that α ≈ 134°, but this leads to angle DAB = 72 + 134 = 206°, which is impossible. Hence, contradiction.

This suggests that there's an error in the assumption that angle AFD is 49°. But how? Let me recheck the given information.

MeasureOf(Angle(B,F,C)) = 49°, which is angle BFC. Since F is the intersection of diagonals, angle BFC is equal to angle AFD (vertical angles). So this should be 49°. But if that leads to inconsistency, perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the angle measurements.

Wait, maybe angle ADF is not 59°, but angle AFD is 59°? Let me check the given constraints.

The user wrote: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,F)), 59). So angle at D, between A and F, which is angle ADF. So angle ADF is 59°, not angle AFD. So that part is correct.

So, in triangle AFD, angle at D is 59°, angle at F is 49°, so angle at A is 72°. Hence, angle FAD = 72°. 

But this leads to contradiction. What if the triangle is not AFD but another triangle?

Wait, let me consider that angle ADF is 59°, and angle AFD is 49°, so angle FAD is 72°. But if angle FAD is 72°, and angle DAB is angle FAD + angle FAB, and angle FAB is part of triangle FBA, which has angle at B of 20°, and other angles.

But if angle FAB is 20°, then angle DAB would be 72 + 20 = 92°. But how do we know angle FAB is 20°? It's not given. Wait, angle FBA is 20°, which is at B, not at A.

Wait, let me try to think differently. Maybe angle DAB is equal to angle FBA + something? Or use the fact that in parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary.

Wait, if I can find one angle, I can find others. Let me think about the sum of angles around point F.

At point F, we have angles: angle AFB, angle BFC, angle CFD, angle DFA. These angles sum to 360°. We know angle BFC = 49°, and angle AFD = 49° (vertical angle). So angles at F: 49° + 49° = 98°, leaving 360 - 98 = 262° for angles AFB and CFD. But not sure.

Alternatively, in triangle FBA, if angle at B is 20°, and if angle FAB is x, and angle AFB is y, then x + 20 + y = 180. Also, in triangle FBC, angle at B is some value, etc.

But without more info, it's hard. Let me try to consider the entire parallelogram.

Let me denote angle DAB as θ. Then, angle ABC = 180° - θ. Since ABCD is a parallelogram.

Now, in triangle FBA, angle at B is 20°, which is part of angle ABC. Let me see: angle ABC is composed of angle FBA (20°) and angle FBC. So angle FBC = angle ABC - 20° = (180 - θ) - 20 = 160 - θ.

In triangle BFC, we know angle at F is 49°, angle at B is 160 - θ, and angle at C is something. Sum of angles in triangle BFC is 180°, so angle at C is 180 - 49 - (160 - θ) = 180 - 49 - 160 + θ = -29 + θ. Wait, this must be positive, so θ > 29°.

But angle at C in triangle BFC is angle BCF. In parallelogram, angle BCD is equal to angle DAB = θ. Since angle BCD is at point C, and angle BCF is part of it. So angle BCF = angle BCD - angle FCD. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, in parallelogram, angle at C is equal to angle at A, which is θ. So angle BCD = θ. In triangle BFC, angle at C is part of angle BCD. Let's call it φ. So φ + ... = ?

Wait, this is getting too abstract. Let me try to use the fact that in triangle BFC, angles are 49°, 160 - θ, and φ, where φ = angle BCF. So:

φ = 180 - 49 - (160 - θ) = 180 - 49 - 160 + θ = -29 + θ.

But φ must be positive, so θ > 29°, which is already satisfied.

Now, in parallelogram, angle at C is θ, so angle BCD = θ. Angle BCF is part of angle BCD, and angle FCD is another part. Since diagonals bisect each other, but not necessarily the angles. However, in a parallelogram, the diagonals divide it into triangles, and the angles at C can be related to other parts.

Alternatively, consider triangle CFD. In triangle CFD, we know angle at D is angle CDF. Since ABCD is a parallelogram, AD is parallel to BC, so angle ADC = angle ABC = 180 - θ. Angle ADC is at D, which is composed of angle ADF (given as 59°) and angle FDC. So angle ADC = angle ADF + angle FDC = 59° + angle FDC = 180 - θ. Hence, angle FDC = 180 - θ - 59 = 121 - θ.

Now, in triangle CFD, we have angles at D (121 - θ), at F (49°), and at C (φ = -29 + θ). So sum of angles:

(121 - θ) + 49 + (-29 + θ) = 121 - θ + 49 - 29 + θ = 121 + 49 - 29 = 141°. But the sum should be 180°. This gives 141° = 180°, which is impossible. Hence, contradiction again!

This suggests that there is a fundamental flaw in the assumptions. This indicates that the initial interpretation of the given angles might be incorrect.

Let me re-examine the given constraints:

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(F, B, A)), 20): This is angle at B between F and A, i.e., angle FBA = 20°.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A, D, F)), 59): This is angle at D between A and F, i.e., angle ADF = 59°.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B, F, C)), 49): This is angle at F between B and C, i.e., angle BFC = 49°.

With this, in triangle AFD, angles at D = 59°, at F = 49°, so angle at A = 72°, leading to angle FAD = 72°. 

In triangle BFC, angle at F = 49°, angle at B = 160 - θ, angle at C = -29 + θ, leading to sum of 141°, which is impossible. Hence, the only way this can be resolved is if there is a miscalculation in the angle relationships.

Wait, let me recompute the sum in triangle CFD. 

In triangle CFD, angles are:

At D: angle CDF = 121 - θ (as derived earlier).

At F: angle CFD = 49° (since angle AFD = 49°, and angle CFD is the same as angle AFD? No, angle CFD is at F between C and D, which is the same as angle AFD? No, angle CFD is part of the diagonal intersection. Wait, at point F, the angles around it are:

- angle AFB, angle BFC, angle CFD, angle DFA. 

We know angle BFC = 49°, angle DFA = 49° (vertical angle). So the remaining two angles at F, angle AFB and angle CFD, sum to 360 - 49 - 49 = 262°. 

In triangle CFD, angle at F is angle CFD, which is part of the 262°. But how much is it?

If we consider triangle CFD, it has angles at C, D, and F. We know angle at D is 121 - θ, angle at F is angle CFD, and angle at C is angle FCD. Let's call angle CFD = x, angle FCD = y. So x + y + (121 - θ) = 180 → x + y = 59 + θ.

Also, in triangle BFC, we have angles at B, F, C: 160 - θ, 49°, and angle at C (let's call it z). So z = 180 - 49 - (160 - θ) = θ - 29.

But angle at C in triangle BFC (z) is the same as angle FCD in triangle CFD (y)? No, angle FCD is part of angle BCD, which is θ. Let me think: at point C, angle BCD = θ. This angle is divided into angle FCD (part of triangle CFD) and angle FCB (part of triangle BFC). So angle FCD + angle FCB = θ. But angle FCB is z = θ - 29. So angle FCD = θ - z = θ - (θ - 29) = 29°.

Hence, in triangle CFD, y = 29°, and x + 29 + (121 - θ) = 180 → x = 180 - 29 - (121 - θ) = 180 - 29 - 121 + θ = 30 + θ.

But x is angle CFD, which is part of the 262° at point F. Also, in triangle AFD, angle AFD = 49°, and angle CFD is x = 30 + θ. But angle AFD and angle CFD are adjacent at point F, forming the straight line through F. Wait, no, they are on different sides. Wait, at point F, the angles around it include angle AFD (49°), angle BFC (49°), and the other two angles (AFB and CFD). Wait, if angle CFD is x = 30 + θ, and angle AFB is something.

But the sum of all angles around F is 360°, so:

angle AFB + angle BFC + angle CFD + angle DFA = 360°

We know angle BFC = 49°, angle DFA = 49°, and angle CFD = x = 30 + θ. Let's denote angle AFB as w. So:

w + 49 + (30 + θ) + 49 = 360

=> w + 128 + θ = 360

=> w = 232 - θ

But in triangle AFB, angles are: at B = 20°, at A = α, at F = w = 232 - θ. So:

20 + α + (232 - θ) = 180

=> α + 232 - θ = 160

=> α = θ - 72

But earlier, we had from triangle AFD that angle FAD = 72°, which is α = angle FAD. Wait, no: angle FAD is part of angle DAB = θ. Wait, angle FAD is α? No, angle FAD is the angle at A in triangle AFD, which we previously calculated as 72°. But according to this, α = θ - 72. But α is angle FAB, which is part of angle DAB = θ. So:

angle DAB = angle FAD + angle FAB = 72 + α = 72 + (θ - 72) = θ. This checks out, but it doesn't give new information.

But we also have from earlier, in triangle AFD, angle FAD = 72°, which is part of angle DAB = θ. So θ = 72 + α, where α = angle FAB = θ - 72.

But from the equation in triangle AFB, we have α = θ - 72. And from the earlier equation in triangle FBA, we had 10 sinα = 16.38 sin(20 + α). But now, with α = θ - 72, and θ is what we're trying to find.

But we also have from the earlier relationship in triangle CFD: x = 30 + θ, and x is angle CFD. Also, in triangle CFD, angle at F is x = 30 + θ, angle at D is 121 - θ, and angle at C is 29°. So:

x + (121 - θ) + 29 = 180

Substitute x = 30 + θ:

30 + θ + 121 - θ + 29 = 180

30 + 121 + 29 = 180 → 180 = 180. This is always true, so no new information.

So we need another equation to solve for θ. Let me recall that in triangle AFD, we had angle FAD = 72°, which is part of angle DAB = θ. So θ = 72 + α, and α = θ - 72. Also, from triangle FBA, we have the equation 10 sinα = 16.38 sin(20 + α).

Let me substitute α = θ - 72 into this equation. But θ is what we need to find. However, this seems circular. Wait, but maybe we can express α in terms of θ and use other relationships.

Alternatively, let me consider that in triangle AFD, angle FAD = 72°, and this angle is part of angle DAB = θ. So θ = 72 + α, where α is angle FAB. But from triangle FBA, we have α = θ - 72. Substituting into the equation 10 sinα = 16.38 sin(20 + α):

10 sin(θ - 72) = 16.38 sin(20 + θ - 72) = 16.38 sin(θ - 52)

So the equation becomes:

10 sin(θ - 72) = 16.38 sin(θ - 52)

Let me denote φ = θ - 72, so the equation becomes:

10 sinφ = 16.38 sin(φ + 20)

Expand sin(φ + 20) using identity:

sin(φ + 20) = sinφ cos20 + cosφ sin20

So:

10 sinφ = 16.38 [sinφ cos20 + cosφ sin20]

Let me plug in numerical values:

cos20 ≈ 0.9397, sin20 ≈ 0.3420

So:

10 sinφ = 16.38 [0.9397 sinφ + 0.3420 cosφ]

Expand RHS:

16.38 * 0.9397 sinφ + 16.38 * 0.3420 cosφ ≈ 15.384 sinφ + 5.593 cosφ

So:

10 sinφ = 15.384 sinφ + 5.593 cosφ

Rearranging:

10 sinφ - 15.384 sinφ = 5.593 cosφ

-5.384 sinφ = 5.593 cosφ

Divide both sides by cosφ:

-5.384 tanφ = 5.593

tanφ = -5.593 / 5.384 ≈ -1.038

So φ = arctan(-1.038). As before, this gives φ ≈ -46°, since tan(-46°) ≈ -1.0355, which is close to -1.038. So φ ≈ -46°.

But φ = θ - 72, so θ = φ + 72 ≈ -46 + 72 = 26°. But this would make angle DAB = 26°, but let's check if this makes sense.

If θ = 26°, then angle DAB = 26°, which is possible. Let's check if this satisfies the earlier condition in triangle CFD.

From earlier, in triangle CFD, angle at C is 29°, angle at D is 121 - θ = 121 - 26 = 95°, and angle at F is x = 30 + θ = 30 + 26 = 56°. Sum: 29 + 95 + 56 = 180°, which is correct.

Also, in triangle AFD, angle at A is 72°, angle at D is 59°, angle at F is 49°, sum 180°, correct.

Now, let's check the equation 10 sinφ = 16.38 sin(φ + 20) with φ = -46°.

Calculate LHS: 10 sin(-46°) ≈ 10 * (-0.7193) ≈ -7.193

RHS: 16.38 sin(-46 + 20) = 16.38 sin(-26°) ≈ 16.38 * (-0.4384) ≈ -7.17. Close enough, considering rounding.

So this suggests that θ ≈ 26°. But none of the answer choices is 26°. The options are 20, 59, 72, 101. Closest is 20 or 59. But 26 is closer to 20 or 59? 26 is 6 away from 20 and 33 away from 59. So closest is 20. But let's check if there's a calculation error.

Wait, but earlier, we had φ = -46°, so θ = 72 + φ = 72 - 46 = 26°. But let's check if this makes sense with the other parts.

If θ = 26°, then angle DAB = 26°. Let's check if this fits with the earlier calculation where angle FAB = α = θ - 72 = 26 - 72 = -46°, which is impossible, as angles cannot be negative. Wait, this suggests a contradiction. How is this possible?

Wait, φ = θ - 72 = -46°, so θ = 72 - 46 = 26°, which is correct. But α = φ = -46°, which is negative. This suggests that my substitution might be incorrect.

Wait, earlier, I defined φ = θ - 72, and α = θ - 72. But α is angle FAB, which should be positive. So if φ is negative, this suggests that angle FAB is negative, which is impossible. Hence, there must be an error in the sign.

Wait, the equation was tanφ = -1.038, which gives φ = -46°, but since φ = θ - 72, and θ is an angle in a parallelogram, it must be between 0 and 180°. So θ = 26°, which is valid. But α = θ - 72 = 26 - 72 = -46°, which is negative. This suggests that my earlier assumption that α = θ - 72 is incorrect.

Wait, where did I get α = θ - 72? Let me revisit.

From the equation in triangle AFB: 20 + α + w = 180, and w = 232 - θ. So:

20 + α + 232 - θ = 180 → α = θ - 72. This is correct.

But if θ = 26°, then α = 26 - 72 = -46°, which is impossible. This suggests that the solution θ = 26° is invalid, despite satisfying the equations. This indicates that there's another solution for φ.

Since tanφ = -1.038, there are multiple solutions. The principal solution is φ = -46°, but also φ = 180 - 46 = 134°, since tangent has period 180°. So φ = 134°.

Let's try φ = 134°. Then θ = φ + 72 = 134 + 72 = 206°, which is impossible for a parallelogram angle. Hence, no good.

Alternatively, φ = -46° + 180° = 134°, which gives θ = 134 + 72 = 206°, again impossible.

Wait, but what if φ is in a different range? Let me consider that φ = -46° + 180° = 134°, but this leads to θ = 134 + 72 = 206°, which is invalid. Alternatively, φ = -46° - 180° = -226°, which is equivalent to 134° (since -226 + 360 = 134). Same result.

This suggests that there is no valid solution under these assumptions, indicating a possible error in the problem setup or my understanding.

However, given that the answer choices are 20, 59, 72, 101, and the closest to our calculated θ = 26° is 20 or 59. Since 26 is closer to 20 (difference 6) than to 59 (difference 33), but let's check if there's another approach.

Wait, let me recall that in triangle AFD, angle at A is 72°, which is part of angle DAB. If angle DAB = 72°, then it would be option C. But why? Let me see.

If angle DAB = 72°, then angle FAD = 72°, which would mean that angle FAB = 0°, which is impossible. But if angle DAB = 72°, then angle FAB would be zero, which is not possible. Hence, this suggests that angle DAB is not 72°, but possibly 180 - 72 = 108°, but 108 is not among the options.

Wait, but maybe the angle DAB is 180 - 72 = 108°, but this is not an option. The closest is 101, which is option D. Alternatively, if angle DAB is 59°, which is option B.

But how?

Let me consider that in triangle AFD, angle at A is 72°, which is part of angle DAB. If angle DAB is 72°, then angle FAD = 72°, and angle FAB = 0°, which is impossible. If angle DAB is 59°, then angle FAD = 72° would be greater than DAB, which is impossible. Hence, this suggests that there's an error in the initial assumption about the angle in triangle AFD.

Wait, perhaps angle AFD is not 49°? Let me re-examine the given angle MeasureOf(Angle(B,F,C)) = 49°, which is angle BFC. Since F is the intersection of diagonals, angle BFC is equal to angle AFD, so it should be 49°. But if this is incorrect, then what?

Alternatively, maybe angle AFD is supplementary to 49°, making it 131°? But why?

No, vertical angles are equal, so angle BFC = angle AFD = 49°.

At this point, after extensive analysis and encountering contradictions, I suspect that the intended answer is 101°, which is option D. Here's why: if angle DAB is 101°, then in the parallelogram, adjacent angle is 79°. Let me see if this fits with the given angle of 20° and 59°.

Alternatively, let me think about the sum of angles around point F. If angle BFC = 49°, and angle AFD = 49°, and angle FBA = 20°, and angle ADF = 59°, perhaps using some triangle properties.

Wait, let me consider triangle ABD. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, since angle FBA = 20°, and angle FAD = 72°, and if angle DAB = 101°, then angle FAB = 101 - 72 = 29°. Let me check if this fits with the earlier equation.

If α = 29°, then in triangle FBA, we have:

10 sin(29°) ≈ 10 * 0.4848 = 4.848

16.38 sin(20 + 29) = 16.38 sin(49°) ≈ 16.38 * 0.7547 ≈ 12.34

Not equal. So this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if angle DAB is 101°, then angle FAB = 101 - 72 = 29°, and let's check if this satisfies the equation 10 sinα = 16.38 sin(20 + α).

With α = 29°, LHS = 10 * sin(29) ≈ 4.848, RHS = 16.38 * sin(49) ≈ 12.34. Not equal.

But if angle DAB is 101°, and angle FAB = 29°, then in triangle FBA, the angles are 20°, 29°, and 131° (since 20 + 29 + 131 = 180). Let's check if this fits with the Law of Sines:

10 / sin(131°) = 16.38 / sin(29°)

Calculate sin(131°) = sin(180 - 49) = sin(49) ≈ 0.7547

So LHS: 10 / 0.754
