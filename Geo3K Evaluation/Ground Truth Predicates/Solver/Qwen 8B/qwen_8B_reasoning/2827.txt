MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So we have a rhombus ABCD. First, I need to recall the properties of a rhombus. All sides are equal, opposite angles are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Also, the diagonals bisect the vertex angles. Hmm, but wait, maybe I should draw a diagram to visualize it better.

The problem states that angle DAB is 2 units? Wait, no, hold on. The question says m∠DAB = 2. Wait, angles are usually measured in degrees, so maybe there's a typo here? Or perhaps it's radians? But the answer choices are in whole numbers like 30, 60, etc., which are typical degree measures. Maybe the original problem had some formatting issues. Let me check again.

Wait, the user wrote: "m ∠ D A B = 2". That might mean that the measure of angle DAB is 2 degrees? But that seems very small for a rhombus. Alternatively, maybe there was a mistake in the problem statement. Wait, looking back at the problem:

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS:
Equals(LengthOf(Line(B, C)), 6)
PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(B, D))
PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(A, C))"

Then the question is: In rhombus ABCD, m∠DAB = 2, m∠ADC and CB = 6. Find m∠ADB.

Wait, maybe there's a translation error here. Perhaps the original problem meant m∠DAB = 2x or something else? Because having angle DAB as 2 degrees would make the rest of the angles too small. Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to say that angle DAB is 2 times something? Or maybe there's a missing part in the problem statement?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is written in Chinese or another language, and the translation led to some confusion. For example, sometimes in problems, angles can be given in terms of variables, but here it's unclear. However, given the answer choices are standard angles, perhaps the angle DAB is actually 60 degrees (which is common in rhombuses), but the user made a typo. Alternatively, maybe the problem says that angle DAB is 2 times some value, but without more context, it's hard to tell.

Wait, let me re-examine the problem again carefully. The user wrote:

"In rhombus A B C D, m ∠ D A B = 2, m ∠ A D C and C B = 6. Find m ∠ A D B."

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo. It might be that the measure of angle ADC is 6? Or that CB = 6? Let me parse the sentence again. 

Original question: "In rhombus A B C D, m ∠ D A B = 2, m ∠ A D C and C B = 6. Find m ∠ A D B."

Hmm, that seems confusing. Maybe it's supposed to say that m∠DAB = 2x, and m∠ADC = x, and CB = 6? Or maybe there's a misformatting. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is saying that m∠DAB = 2, m∠ADC = ?, and CB = 6? But then how does that help us find m∠ADB?

Alternatively, maybe there was a formatting issue where the problem said "m∠DAB = 2°, m∠ADC = 6°", but due to formatting errors, it got merged. Alternatively, maybe "CB = 6" refers to the length of side BC being 6, since in a rhombus all sides are equal. Then, given that, and knowing that angle DAB is 2... Wait, but angle measures in a rhombus are related. Let me think.

In a rhombus, adjacent angles are supplementary. So if angle DAB is θ, then angle ABC is 180°−θ, and so on. But if angle DAB is given as 2, which is likely in degrees, then the other angles would be 180−2=178°, which seems extremely large. But maybe it's in radians? If angle DAB is 2 radians, then converting to degrees, 2 radians ≈ 114.59°, which still isn't matching standard angles. Alternatively, maybe the problem intended angle DAB to be 60°, and there was a typo. Given that the answer choices include 60°, which is common in rhombus problems.

But given that the user included the constraint that CB = 6. Since in a rhombus all sides are equal, so AB = BC = CD = DA = 6. So CB is 6. Now, the problem asks for m∠ADB. Point E lies on BD and AC. Wait, but the problem mentions point E lying on both lines BD and AC. Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals intersect at the center, so their intersection point is O, which is the midpoint of both diagonals. So point E could be the intersection point of diagonals AC and BD. Therefore, E is the center of the rhombus.

So angle ADB is the angle at point D between points A and B. Wait, angle ADB is formed by points A-D-B. So it's the angle at D between AD and DB. Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. So let's consider triangle ABD. Wait, but maybe I need to use coordinates to model this.

Let me try to assign coordinates to the rhombus. Let me place point D at the origin (0,0). Since it's a rhombus, suppose side DC is along the x-axis. Let me denote the coordinates. Let me assume that diagonal AC and BD intersect at point E. Since diagonals bisect each other, E is the midpoint of both diagonals.

But maybe using vectors or coordinate geometry would help. Alternatively, using trigonometry. Let me think about the angles.

Given that in a rhombus, the diagonals divide it into four congruent right triangles. Wait, no, they form four right triangles only if the rhombus is a square. Otherwise, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are always perpendicular. Yes! One key property of a rhombus is that its diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So diagonals AC and BD intersect at right angles at their midpoints.

Now, angle DAB is given as 2... Assuming it's in degrees, even though that seems odd. Let me proceed with that assumption. Let me call angle DAB = α = 2 degrees. Then, angle ABC = 180 - α = 178 degrees, angle BCD = α = 2 degrees, and angle ADC = 178 degrees. Wait, but in a rhombus, opposite angles are equal. So angle DAB equals angle BCD, and angle ABC equals angle ADC. 

But then, if angle DAB is 2 degrees, then angle ADC is also 2 degrees? No, wait, angle ADC is adjacent to angle DAB. Wait, no. Let me clarify the vertices. In rhombus ABCD, the order is such that consecutive vertices are connected. So the vertices are A, B, C, D in order. So angle DAB is at vertex A, between D-A-B. Then angle ABC is at vertex B, between A-B-C. Angle BCD is at vertex C, between B-C-D. Angle ADC is at vertex D, between C-D-A. 

Since in a rhombus, adjacent angles are supplementary. So angle DAB + angle ABC = 180°, angle ABC + angle BCD = 180°, etc. Therefore, if angle DAB is α, then angle ABC is 180°−α, angle BCD is α, and angle ADC is 180°−α. 

Wait, so angle ADC is 180°−α. But according to the problem, maybe there's a relation involving angle ADC? Wait, the problem says "m∠DAB = 2, m∠ADC and CB = 6." Wait, maybe there was a mistranslation or typo. Suppose it's supposed to say that m∠DAB = 2x, and m∠ADC = x, and CB = 6? Or perhaps that angle ADC is 6 degrees? But that's speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the original problem had m∠DAB = 2x and m∠ADC = 6x, leading to equations based on supplementary angles. But without clear information, it's challenging. However, given that CB = 6, which is a side length, since all sides are equal in a rhombus, so each side is 6 units. So BC = 6, which makes sense.

Assuming that angle DAB is given as 2 radians? If that's the case, then converting to degrees, 2 radians is approximately 114.59 degrees. But again, not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach.

Wait, the problem also mentions point E lying on both lines BD and AC. Which in a rhombus, those diagonals intersect at point E, which is the center. So E is the intersection point of diagonals AC and BD. Therefore, in triangle ABD, point E is the midpoint of BD. Wait, but angle ADB is the angle at D between points A, D, B. So in triangle ADB, angle at D. To find this angle, maybe we can use the law of cosines or sines, considering the lengths.

But first, let's get the necessary information. Since ABCD is a rhombus with all sides equal to 6. Let me denote AB = BC = CD = DA = 6. Let me focus on triangle ABD. Points A, B, D. We need to find angle ADB. 

But to apply the law of cosines, I need to know the lengths of sides around angle D. In triangle ABD, sides are AD, BD, and AB. AD is 6, AB is 6. So two sides are known, but BD is unknown. So if I can find BD, then I can compute angle ADB.

But how to find BD? In a rhombus, the diagonals satisfy the relationship: the sum of squares of the diagonals equals four times the square of a side. Formula: (AC)^2 + (BD)^2 = 4*(side)^2. But I don't know either diagonal. However, if I can relate the diagonals to the angles.

Another formula: In a rhombus, the length of the diagonals can be expressed in terms of the angles. Let me recall that. If θ is one of the angles of the rhombus, then the diagonals p and q can be found as:

p = 2*a*sin(θ/2)

q = 2*a*cos(θ/2)

Wait, no. Actually, the formulas depend on the angles. Let me think again. Each diagonal splits the rhombus into two congruent triangles. The diagonals split the angles into halves. So, for example, if angle DAB is α, then the diagonal AC splits it into two angles of α/2. Similarly, the other diagonal BD splits the angles into halves.

Using trigonometry, the diagonals can be calculated. Let me take angle DAB = α. Then, the diagonals can be found using the formula:

d1 = 2*a*sin(α/2)

d2 = 2*a*cos(α/2)

Wait, no. Let me derive it. Consider the rhombus with side length a, and angle α at vertex A. The diagonals are d1 and d2. The diagonals split the rhombus into four right triangles. Wait, no. When you draw the diagonals, they bisect each other at right angles. So each half of the diagonals forms legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse equal to the side of the rhombus.

Let me denote half of diagonal AC as p, and half of diagonal BD as q. Then, since they are perpendicular, we have:

a² = p² + q²

Also, the diagonals are related to the angles. For instance, the angle between side AB and diagonal AC can be considered. Let me think about splitting the rhombus into triangles.

Alternatively, using the formula for diagonals in terms of angles:

If α is one of the angles, then the diagonals are:

d1 = 2*a*sin(α/2) 

and 

d2 = 2*a*cos(α/2)

Wait, no. Wait, when you split the rhombus into triangles, the diagonals can be calculated using the law of cosines. For example, in triangle ABD, where AB and AD are sides of length a, and angle BAD is α. Then, applying the law of cosines to triangle ABD:

BD² = AB² + AD² - 2*AB*AD*cos(angle BAD)

Which simplifies to:

BD² = a² + a² - 2*a²*cos(α) = 2a²(1 - cosα)

Thus,

BD = sqrt[2a²(1 - cosα)] = a*sqrt(2*(1 - cosα))

Similarly, the other diagonal AC can be found using the fact that adjacent angles are supplementary. So if angle BAD is α, then angle ABC is π - α (in radians) or 180° - α. Using similar logic, the diagonal AC would be:

AC² = 2a²(1 - cos(π - α)) = 2a²(1 + cosα)

Because cos(π - α) = -cosα.

Therefore,

AC = a*sqrt(2*(1 + cosα))

So, putting it together, the diagonals are:

BD = a*sqrt(2*(1 - cosα))

AC = a*sqrt(2*(1 + cosα))

Now, returning to our problem. Let's assume that angle DAB is α = 2 degrees. Then, BD = 6 * sqrt(2*(1 - cos(2°))). However, calculating this would give a very small value for BD, which may not align with the other constraints. Alternatively, if angle DAB is 60 degrees, then BD would be 6 * sqrt(2*(1 - cos60°)) = 6*sqrt(2*(1 - 0.5)) = 6*sqrt(1) = 6. Then, AC would be 6*sqrt(2*(1 + 0.5)) = 6*sqrt(3) ≈ 10.392. This seems plausible.

However, the problem states that m∠DAB = 2. If this is in degrees, then BD would be very short, making angle ADB possibly very small. But given that the answer choices are 30, 60, 90, 120, it suggests that angle ADB is a standard angle. So perhaps there was a mistake in the problem statement, and angle DAB is 60° instead of 2°, which is common in rhombus problems. Alternatively, maybe the angle is 2 radians, which is roughly 114.59°, but that doesn't fit well with the answer choices.

Alternatively, maybe the problem meant that angle DAB is 60°, and there was a formatting error where the number 2 was misplaced. Let's tentatively assume that angle DAB is 60°, which is a common angle in rhombus problems, and see where that leads us.

Assuming angle DAB = 60°, then BD = 6 * sqrt(2*(1 - cos60°)). Cos60° is 0.5, so 1 - 0.5 = 0.5. Thus, BD = 6*sqrt(2*0.5) = 6*sqrt(1) = 6. So BD = 6. Then, AC = 6*sqrt(2*(1 + 0.5)) = 6*sqrt(3).

Now, in triangle ABD, sides AD = 6, AB = 6, and BD = 6. So triangle ABD is equilateral because all sides are equal. Therefore, all angles are 60°. Hence, angle ADB is 60°, which corresponds to option B. 

But wait, if BD is 6, then triangle ABD is equilateral, hence angle ADB is 60°. That fits with the answer choice B. But why would the problem mention point E lying on both diagonals? Well, in this scenario, since E is the intersection of diagonals, which in this case, since BD = 6, and AC = 6√3, the diagonals intersect at E, which divides them into halves. But since BD is 6, then BE = ED = 3. But maybe this detail isn't directly needed for finding angle ADB.

However, if angle DAB is indeed 60°, then angle ADB is 60°, so the answer would be B. But this relies on assuming that angle DAB is 60°, which contradicts the original problem stating it as 2. 

Alternatively, if angle DAB is 2 radians (~114.59°), then BD would be:

cos(2 radians) ≈ cos(114.59°) ≈ -0.4161. Thus, 1 - cos(2 rad) ≈ 1 - (-0.4161) = 1.4161. Then BD = 6*sqrt(2*1.4161) ≈ 6*sqrt(2.832) ≈ 6*1.683 ≈ 10.098. Then, in triangle ABD, sides AD = 6, AB = 6, BD ≈ 10.098. Applying the law of cosines to find angle at D (angle ADB):

cos(angle ADB) = (AD² + BD² - AB²)/(2*AD*BD)

Wait, no, angle ADB is at D, so the sides adjacent to angle D are AD and BD, with AB being the opposite side. Wait, let me clarify:

In triangle ABD, angle at D is between AD and BD. The sides adjacent to angle D are AD and BD, and the side opposite is AB. So using the law of cosines:

AB² = AD² + BD² - 2*AD*BD*cos(angle ADB)

So rearranged:

cos(angle ADB) = (AD² + BD² - AB²)/(2*AD*BD)

Plugging in values:

AD = 6, BD ≈ 10.098, AB = 6.

Calculating numerator:

6² + (10.098)² - 6² = (36 + 101.97) - 36 = 101.97

Denominator: 2*6*10.098 ≈ 121.176

So cos(angle ADB) ≈ 101.97 / 121.176 ≈ 0.841.

Taking arccos(0.841) ≈ 32.7 degrees. Which is close to 30 degrees. But the answer choices are 30, 60, 90, 120. So closest is A. But this depends on angle DAB being 2 radians, which is not standard. Hence, this suggests inconsistency in the problem statement.

This indicates that there's likely a mistake in the problem's phrasing. Given that, and considering standard rhombus problems, it's possible that the intended angle DAB was 60°, leading to angle ADB being 60°, which matches answer B. Alternatively, if angle DAB is 120°, then angle ADB would be different.

Let me try with angle DAB = 120°, which is common in rhombus problems. Then, BD = 6*sqrt(2*(1 - cos(120°))). Cos(120°) = -0.5, so 1 - (-0.5) = 1.5. Thus, BD = 6*sqrt(2*1.5) = 6*sqrt(3) ≈ 10.392. Then, in triangle ABD, sides AD = 6, AB = 6, BD ≈ 10.392. Again, using the law of cosines:

cos(angle ADB) = (AD² + BD² - AB²)/(2*AD*BD)

Numerator: 36 + (10.392)^2 - 36 = (108) ≈ 108

Denominator: 2*6*10.392 ≈ 124.704

So cos(angle ADB) ≈ 108 / 124.704 ≈ 0.866. Arccos(0.866) ≈ 30°, which is option A. So if angle DAB is 120°, then angle ADB is 30°, which would correspond to answer A.

But how do we determine which angle is intended? The problem states m∠DAB = 2, which is ambiguous. However, if we consider that in a rhombus, the diagonals create angles that are complementary to half the angles of the rhombus. Let me think differently.

Let me consider that point E is the intersection of diagonals AC and BD. In a rhombus, diagonals bisect the angles. So, for example, diagonal BD bisects angle DAB into two equal parts. So, angle ADB is half of angle DAB? No, wait. Wait, angle ADB is part of triangle ABD. Let me think.

Actually, in rhombus ABCD, diagonal BD splits angle DAB into two equal angles. So, angle ABD = angle ADB? No, angle ABD is at point B, while angle ADB is at point D. Let me clarify.

At vertex A, angle DAB is split by diagonal AC into two equal angles of α/2. At vertex D, angle ADC is split by diagonal AC into two equal angles. Wait, no, diagonal BD splits angle ADC. Wait, the diagonals bisect the angles at the vertices. So, diagonal AC bisects angle DAB and angle BCD, while diagonal BD bisects angle ABC and angle ADC.

Wait, yes. So, for example, diagonal BD bisects angle ADC. So angle ADC is split into two equal angles by diagonal BD. So, angle ADB is one of these angles. Wait, angle ADC is at vertex D, between points A, D, C. Diagonal BD connects B to D, so it splits angle ADC into two angles: angle ADB and angle CDB. Therefore, each of these angles is half of angle ADC.

But angle ADC is supplementary to angle DAB. So if angle DAB is α, then angle ADC = 180° - α. Therefore, each of the angles created by diagonal BD at vertex D is (180° - α)/2.

But angle ADB is one of these angles. So angle ADB = (180° - α)/2.

Wait, let me verify this. At vertex D, angle ADC is 180° - α. Diagonal BD splits this angle into two equal parts. Therefore, each part is (180° - α)/2. Hence, angle ADB is (180° - α)/2.

So, if we can find α, which is angle DAB, then angle ADB = (180° - α)/2.

But the problem states that m∠DAB = 2. Assuming this is in degrees, then angle ADB = (180 - 2)/2 = 178/2 = 89°, which is not among the answer choices. But if the angle DAB is in radians, then 2 radians is approx 114.59°, giving angle ADB ≈ (180 - 114.59)/2 ≈ 32.7°, which is closest to 30°, option A. 

But again, this is speculative. However, considering that the answer choices include 30 and 60, and the possibility of a typo, maybe the intended angle DAB was 120°, leading to angle ADB = (180 - 120)/2 = 30°, which is option A. Alternatively, if angle DAB was 60°, then angle ADB would be (180 - 60)/2 = 60°, which is option B.

But how do we decide between A and B? Let's look back at the given data. The problem also mentions that CB = 6. Since all sides are equal in a rhombus, CB is a side, so all sides are 6. Additionally, there's a point E lying on both lines BD and AC, which is the intersection point of the diagonals. 

But if angle ADB is 30°, then angle ADB = 30°, which would make sense if angle DAB was 120°. Alternatively, if angle ADB is 60°, then angle DAB is 60°. 

But how can we determine which one is correct? Let's think about the diagonals. In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So if angle ADB is 30°, then in triangle ADE (where E is the intersection point), we might have certain relations.

Alternatively, since we know the side length is 6, and if angle DAB is 60°, then the rhombus becomes a diamond shape with all angles 60° and 120°, making it effectively a regular hexagon split into parts. In this case, the diagonals would be in specific ratios. 

For example, if angle DAB is 60°, then the longer diagonal AC would be 2*6*cos(30°) = 12*(√3/2) = 6√3, and shorter diagonal BD would be 2*6*sin(30°) = 6. As previously calculated. In this case, the diagonals are 6 and 6√3. Then, the intersection point E divides the diagonals into halves: AE = EC = 3√3, and BE = ED = 3. 

Now, in triangle ABD, we have AD = 6, BD = 6, and AB = 6. So triangle ABD is equilateral, hence angle ADB is 60°, which matches option B. 

But if angle DAB is 120°, then the diagonals would be BD = 2*6*sin(60°) = 6√3, and AC = 2*6*cos(60°) = 6. So in this case, BD is longer than AC. Then, in triangle ABD, sides AD = 6, AB = 6, and BD = 6√3. Applying the law of cosines:

AB² = AD² + BD² - 2*AD*BD*cos(angle ADB)

=> 36 = 36 + (6√3)^2 - 2*6*6√3*cos(angle ADB)

Wait, no. Wait, AB is the side opposite angle ADB in triangle ABD. Wait, let me redo:

In triangle ABD, angle at D is angle ADB. Sides: AD = 6, BD = 6√3, AB = 6.

Applying law of cosines:

AB² = AD² + BD² - 2*AD*BD*cos(angle ADB)

So:

6² = 6² + (6√3)^2 - 2*6*(6√3)*cos(angle ADB)

Calculate:

36 = 36 + 36*3 - 72√3 * cos(angle ADB)

Simplify:

36 = 36 + 108 - 72√3 * cos(angle ADB)

36 = 144 - 72√3 * cos(angle ADB)

Subtract 144:

-108 = -72√3 * cos(angle ADB)

Divide both sides by -72√3:

(108)/(72√3) = cos(angle ADB)

Simplify:

(3)/(2√3) = (√3)/2 ≈ 0.866

So cos(angle ADB) = √3/2 → angle ADB = 30°, which is option A.

So depending on whether angle DAB is 60° or 120°, angle ADB is 60° or 30° respectively. 

But the original problem states angle DAB = 2. If this is a typo and should be 60°, then answer is B; if it's 120°, answer is A. How to determine which one is correct?

Looking back at the problem statement: "m∠DAB = 2, m∠ADC and C B = 6." There might be a misinterpretation here. Perhaps the original problem stated that m∠DAB = 2x, m∠ADC = x, and CB = 6. Let's assume that. Let me set up equations.

Let me denote angle DAB as α. Then, since in a rhombus, adjacent angles are supplementary, angle ADC = 180° - α. If the problem says that m∠ADC = x, and m∠DAB = 2x, then:

From above, angle DAB = 2x, angle ADC = x. But angle ADC = 180° - α = 180° - 2x. So:

180° - 2x = x => 180° = 3x => x = 60°. Hence, angle DAB = 2x = 120°, angle ADC = 60°. This makes sense. So in this case, angle DAB is 120°, leading to angle ADB = (180° - α)/2 = (180 - 120)/2 = 30°, which is option A. 

This suggests that the original problem had a typo, where m∠DAB = 2x and m∠ADC = x, and CB = 6. With this interpretation, angle ADB is 30°, corresponding to option A. 

Therefore, despite the ambiguity in the problem statement, assuming that there was a typo where m∠DAB = 2x and m∠ADC = x, leading to angle DAB = 120°, and thus angle ADB = 30°, the correct answer would be A. 

Alternatively, if the original problem had m∠DAB = 2 and m∠ADC = 6, but that doesn't fit. 

Considering that the answer choices include 30 and 60, and given the logical deduction under the assumption that there was a typo in the angle measures, the most reasonable conclusion is that angle ADB is 30°, option A.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we begin by understanding the structure of a **rhombus** and the implications of the given conditions:

---

### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry of the Rhombus

A **rhombus** is a quadrilateral with:

- All sides of equal length.
- Opposite angles are equal.
- Adjacent angles are supplementary (i.e., they add up to $180^\circ$).
- The diagonals bisect each other at right angles.
- The diagonals also bisect the vertex angles.

We are told:

- $\angle DAB = 2$
- Side $CB = 6$, implying all sides are 6 (since it’s a rhombus).
- Point $E$ lies on both diagonals $AC$ and $BD$, i.e., it is the **intersection point of the diagonals**, which is the **center** of the rhombus.

We are asked to find the measure of $\angle ADB$, the angle at vertex $D$ between segments $AD$ and $BD$.

---

### Step 2: Interpreting the Ambiguity in the Problem Statement

There appears to be an ambiguity in the problem:  
> *"m∠DAB = 2, m∠ADC and CB = 6."*

This is interpreted as a potential typographical or formatting issue. A more coherent interpretation is:

> *"m∠DAB = 2x*, and *m∠ADC = x*" — meaning that the angles are in a ratio of 2:1, consistent with the properties of a rhombus.

This gives us:

$$
\angle DAB = 2x, \quad \angle ADC = x
$$

Since adjacent angles in a rhombus are supplementary:

$$
\angle DAB + \angle ADC = 180^\circ
$$

Substituting:

$$
2x + x = 180^\circ \Rightarrow 3x = 180^\circ \Rightarrow x = 60^\circ
$$

So,
$$
\angle DAB = 120^\circ, \quad \angle ADC = 60^\circ
$$

---

### Step 3: Finding $\angle ADB$

Diagonals in a rhombus **bisect the angles** at the vertices. So, diagonal $BD$ bisects $\angle ADC$. That means:

$$
\angle ADB = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \angle ADC = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 60^\circ = 30^\circ
$$

---

### Final Conclusion

Based on the corrected interpretation of the angle measures and the geometric properties of a rhombus, the measure of $\angle ADB$ is:

$$
\boxed{30^\circ}
$$

---
