MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, and C. The angle at point B (Angle A, B, C) is 60 degrees. The length of line BC is y, AB is 20 units, AC is x. Also, there's a perpendicularity condition: line CA is perpendicular to line CB. Wait, that means lines CA and CB form a right angle at point C? Let me visualize this.

First, drawing a rough sketch might help. Since angle at B is 60 degrees, but also lines CA and CB are perpendicular. Wait, hold on. If lines CA and CB are perpendicular, then they meet at point C, forming a right angle. So, triangle ABC has a right angle at C? But angle at B is given as 60 degrees. Hmm, so maybe I need to clarify the configuration here.

Wait, the problem says Perpendicular(Line(C, A), Line(C, B)). That means line segments CA and CB are perpendicular. So, the angle between CA and CB is 90 degrees. Therefore, triangle ABC has a right angle at point C. However, angle at B is given as 60 degrees. Wait, that seems conflicting because in a triangle, the sum of angles is 180 degrees. If angle at C is 90 degrees, and angle at B is 60 degrees, then angle at A would be 30 degrees. But how does that relate to the sides?

But wait, the sides given are AB = 20, BC = y, and AC = x. Let me recall the Pythagorean theorem for the right-angled triangle. Since it's a right triangle at C, then AB² = AC² + BC². Because AB is the hypotenuse. So:

AB² = AC² + BC²  
=> 20² = x² + y²  
So, 400 = x² + y².

But we also know that angle at B is 60 degrees. In triangle ABC, angle at B is 60 degrees. How can we use that? Maybe using trigonometry here.

In triangle ABC, since it's a right-angled triangle at C, angle at B is opposite to side AC. Let me think about the trigonometric ratios. For angle B, which is 60 degrees, the opposite side is AC (length x), adjacent side is BC (length y), and hypotenuse AB is 20.

So tan(angle B) = opposite / adjacent = AC / BC = x / y.

Given angle B is 60 degrees, so tan(60°) = x/y. We know tan(60°) is √3. So:

√3 = x / y => x = y * √3.

Now, substitute x into the equation from Pythagoras:

x² + y² = 400  
(y√3)² + y² = 400  
3y² + y² = 400  
4y² = 400  
y² = 100  
y = 10 (since length can't be negative)

Therefore, y is 10. Looking at the answer choices, option D is 10. So the answer should be D.

Let me check again. If angle at C is 90°, angle at B is 60°, then angle at A is 30°, which makes sense. Then in such a triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. Here, BC is adjacent to angle B, AC is opposite, and AB is hypotenuse. So if angle B is 60°, then the sides opposite and adjacent would correspond to the ratios. 

For example, in a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are 1, √3, 2. The side opposite 30° is the shortest one. Wait, angle at A is 30°, so side BC (opposite angle A) would be the shorter leg. Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the labels.

Wait, angle at B is 60°, so the sides relative to angle B: opposite side is AC (which is x), adjacent side is BC (which is y). Hypotenuse is AB=20. So tan(60°)=x/y, which gives us x = y√3. Then Pythagoras gives x² + y² = 400. Substituting x = y√3 leads to 3y² + y² = 4y² = 400 → y² = 100 → y = 10. So yes, that checks out. Therefore, the correct answer is D, 10.

To determine the value of $ y $, we begin by analyzing the geometric setup based on the given constraints:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Triangle Configuration**

We are told:
- $\angle ABC = 60^\circ$
- $\text{Line}(CA)$ is **perpendicular** to $\text{Line}(CB)$, i.e., $\angle ACB = 90^\circ$
- This implies triangle $ABC$ is a **right triangle**, with the right angle at $C$, and $\angle ABC = 60^\circ$

Thus, the remaining angle at vertex $A$ must satisfy:
$$
\angle CAB = 180^\circ - \angle ABC - \angle ACB = 180^\circ - 60^\circ - 90^\circ = 30^\circ
$$

So, triangle $ABC$ is a **30–60–90 triangle**, with:
- Right angle at $C$
- $60^\circ$ angle at $B$
- $30^\circ$ angle at $A$

---

### **Step 2: Use Known Properties of a 30–60–90 Triangle**

In a 30–60–90 triangle:
- Sides are in the ratio: $1 : \sqrt{3} : 2$
  - Side opposite $30^\circ$: shortest side
  - Side opposite $60^\circ$: longer leg
  - Hypotenuse: longest side

Labeling the triangle accordingly:
- Opposite $30^\circ$ ($\angle CAB$): segment $BC = y$
- Opposite $60^\circ$ ($\angle ABC$): segment $AC = x$
- Hypotenuse: segment $AB = 20$

From the 30–60–90 triangle property:
$$
\tan(60^\circ) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{x}{y}
$$
$$
\tan(60^\circ) = \sqrt{3} \Rightarrow \frac{x}{y} = \sqrt{3} \Rightarrow x = y\sqrt{3}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**

Using the Pythagorean Theorem for triangle $ABC$:
$$
AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2
$$
Substitute known values:
$$
20^2 = x^2 + y^2
\Rightarrow 400 = x^2 + y^2
$$

Now replace $x = y\sqrt{3}$:
$$
400 = (y\sqrt{3})^2 + y^2 = 3y^2 + y^2 = 4y^2
\Rightarrow y^2 = 100 \Rightarrow y = \sqrt{100} = 10
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

The value of $ y $ is:
$$
\boxed{10}
$$
