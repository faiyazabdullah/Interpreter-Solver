MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given constraints and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the information provided:

Given:
1. The length of line MC is 7 units.
2. The length of line MR is 4 units.
3. Point M lies on line SC.
4. Point T lies on line CB.
5. Point R lies on line CA.
6. Point S lies on line BA.
7. Point M lies on line BR.
8. Point M lies on line AT.
9. The length of SA equals the length of SB.
10. The length of CT equals the length of TB.
11. The length of AR equals the length of RC.

We need to find the length of MS, given that AT is 16 units.

Let me visualize this. Maybe drawing a diagram would help, but since I can't draw here, I'll try to imagine it based on the points mentioned.

First, let's note all the points involved: A, B, C, R, S, T, M. There are several lines connecting these points. Let me try to map them out.

From constraint 3: M lies on SC. So point M is somewhere along the line segment SC.

Constraint 4: T lies on CB. So T is on CB.

Constraint 5: R lies on CA. So R is on CA.

Constraint 6: S lies on BA. So S is on BA.

Constraint 7: M lies on BR. So M is also on BR.

Constraint 8: M lies on AT. So M is on AT as well.

So point M is the intersection of lines BR, AT, and SC. Since M is on SC (from constraint 3) and also on BR (constraint 7), so BR intersects SC at M. Also, M is on AT (constraint 8). Therefore, lines BR and AT intersect at M.

Also, S is on BA (constraint 6), so S is a point between B and A? Or maybe extended?

Similarly, R is on CA (constraint 5), so R could be between C and A or extended.

Constraints 9: SA = SB. So triangle SAB has SA equal to SB. That suggests that S is equidistant from A and B, meaning it lies on the perpendicular bisector of AB. But since S is on BA (constraint 6), which is a straight line. Wait, if S is on BA, then for SA = SB, S must be the midpoint of BA? Because if you're on BA, the only point equidistant from A and B is the midpoint. Unless BA is a line segment, and S is beyond A or B. Wait, suppose BA is a line. If S is on BA such that SA = SB, then S must be the midpoint of BA. Because if S is between B and A, then SA + SB = AB, but SA = SB implies that SA = SB = AB/2. However, if S is not between B and A, say beyond A, then SA would be longer than AB, and SB would be SA + AB. But SA = SB would require SA = SA + AB → AB=0, which isn't possible. Similarly for beyond B. Hence, S must lie at the midpoint of BA. Therefore, S is the midpoint of BA.

Wait, but BA is a line. So S being on BA and SA = SB means that S is the midpoint. So coordinates might help here. Maybe assigning coordinates to points would make this easier.

Let me assign coordinate system. Let me assume coordinates for some points to model this. Let me pick coordinates such that I can compute positions easily.

Let me set up coordinates. Let me place points A and B on x-axis for simplicity. Let me assume A is at (0,0) and B is at (b, 0) for some b. Then BA is the line from (0,0) to (b,0). Then point S is the midpoint of BA, so S would be at ((b)/2, 0). Wait, but according to constraint 6, S lies on BA, so yes. But if S is midpoint, then SA = SB = b/2. But maybe I need to check later.

But first, let me consider other constraints. Also, point R lies on CA (constraint 5). Let me assume point C is somewhere else. Let me think about how to place all points.

Alternatively, perhaps using vectors or coordinate geometry. Let me proceed step by step.

Since there are multiple lines and points, maybe coordinate geometry will help. Let me assign coordinates to points.

Let me fix some coordinates. Let me assume coordinates:

Let me take point A at (0, 0).

Let me take point B at (2a, 0), so that midpoint S of BA is at (a, 0). Then SA = SB = a. But maybe I can adjust variables accordingly. However, since we have lengths involving other points, like MC = 7, MR = 4, etc., perhaps I need more variables.

Alternatively, maybe I should use mass point geometry or similar triangles? Not sure yet.

Alternatively, since there are several points lying on lines, maybe considering ratios.

But first, let me see if I can find relations between the points.

Starting with S. As per above, S is on BA and SA = SB. So S is midpoint of BA. Therefore, BS = SA.

Then, from constraint 6: S lies on BA. Which we've considered.

Now, looking at constraint 9: SA = SB, which confirms S is midpoint of BA.

Moving on to point R: lies on CA (constraint 5). Also, constraint 11 says AR = RC. So R is the midpoint of CA. Because if R is on CA and AR = RC, then R is the midpoint. Therefore, R divides CA into two equal parts.

Therefore, R is midpoint of CA.

Similarly, constraint 10: CT = TB. So T lies on CB, and CT = TB. Hence, T is the midpoint of CB.

So, summarizing:

- S is midpoint of BA.

- R is midpoint of CA.

- T is midpoint of CB.

That seems important. Now, with that, perhaps we can find coordinates for all points.

Let me assign coordinates again.

Let me set coordinates:

Let me take coordinates with A at (0, 0), B at (2b, 0), so that midpoint S of BA is at (b, 0). Then, point C can be placed at (c_x, c_y). Then, since R is midpoint of CA, coordinates of R would be [(0 + c_x)/2, (0 + c_y)/2] = (c_x / 2, c_y / 2).

Similarly, T is midpoint of CB. Coordinates of C are (c_x, c_y), coordinates of B are (2b, 0). Midpoint T would be [(c_x + 2b)/2, (c_y + 0)/2] = ((c_x + 2b)/2, c_y / 2).

Now, point M lies on SC (constraint 3), BR (constraint 7), and AT (constraint 8). Also, M lies on line SC, which connects S (midpoint of BA) and C.

So, coordinates of S: (b, 0)

Coordinates of C: (c_x, c_y)

So parametric equation of line SC: starting at S(b, 0) going towards C(c_x, c_y). Any point on SC can be written as S + t*(C - S) = (b + t(c_x - b), 0 + t(c_y - 0)) = (b + t(c_x - b), t c_y), where t ∈ [0,1].

Similarly, point M lies on BR (constraint 7). Let me find coordinates of BR.

Points B(2b, 0) and R(midpoint of CA): R is (c_x / 2, c_y / 2). So line BR goes from B(2b, 0) to R(c_x/2, c_y/2). Parametric equations for BR: starting at B, direction vector is R - B = (c_x/2 - 2b, c_y/2 - 0) = ( (c_x - 4b)/2 , c_y / 2 ). So parametric form: B + s*(R - B) = (2b + s*(c_x - 4b)/2, 0 + s*(c_y)/2 )

Similarly, point M lies on BR and SC. So coordinates of M satisfy both parametric equations. So solving for parameters t and s where the coordinates match.

Additionally, M lies on AT (constraint 8). Let me find equation for line AT.

Point A is (0,0), and point T is midpoint of CB: ((c_x + 2b)/2, c_y / 2 ). So line AT goes from A(0,0) to T((c_x + 2b)/2, c_y / 2 ). Parametric equations for AT: (k * (c_x + 2b)/2, k * c_y / 2 ), where k ∈ [0,1].

But since M lies on AT, its coordinates must satisfy this as well.

So, combining all three conditions: M lies on SC, BR, and AT. So coordinates of M must satisfy all three parametric equations. This gives us a system of equations.

Moreover, we know distances: MC = 7, MR = 4, and AT = 16. We need to find MS.

But since coordinates are variables, maybe we can express everything in terms of variables and find relations.

Alternatively, maybe choosing specific coordinates for simplicity. For example, setting certain values to simplify calculations.

Let me try to assign coordinates with specific values. Let me assume some coordinates for simplicity.

Let me choose coordinates such that:

Let me set A at (0,0), B at (2, 0), so that midpoint S of BA is at (1, 0). Then, let me choose coordinates for C. Let me pick C at (0, something) to make things symmetric? Or maybe another approach.

Alternatively, since we have midpoints, maybe choosing coordinates where C is at (0, h), making calculations easier.

Let me try:

Let me set A(0, 0), B(2, 0), so midpoint S is (1, 0). Let me set C(0, c), so that coordinates of C are (0, c). Then:

Midpoint R of CA: CA is from A(0,0) to C(0,c). Midpoint R is (0, c/2).

Midpoint T of CB: C(0,c) and B(2,0). Midpoint T is ((0+2)/2, (c + 0)/2 ) = (1, c/2).

So coordinates:

A(0, 0), B(2, 0), S(1, 0), C(0, c), R(0, c/2), T(1, c/2).

Now, line SC connects S(1, 0) to C(0, c). Equation of line SC: Let me parametrize it.

Parametric equations for SC: Starting at S(1,0), moving towards C(0,c). So direction vector is (-1, c). So parametric equations:

x = 1 - t

y = 0 + c*t

for t ∈ [0,1].

Point M lies on SC, so coordinates of M can be represented as (1 - t, ct) for some parameter t.

Also, M lies on BR. Points B(2,0) and R(0, c/2). Let me find equation of line BR.

Coordinates of B(2,0) and R(0, c/2). The slope of BR is (c/2 - 0)/(0 - 2) = (c/2)/(-2) = -c/4.

Equation of BR: Using point B(2,0):

y - 0 = (-c/4)(x - 2)

=> y = (-c/4)x + (c/4)*2 = (-c/4)x + c/2.

So, coordinates of M lie on BR as well. So substituting x and y from parametric equations of SC into BR's equation.

From SC: x = 1 - t, y = c t.

Substitute into BR equation:

c t = (-c/4)(1 - t) + c/2

Multiply through:

Left side: c t

Right side: (-c/4)(1 - t) + c/2 = (-c/4 + c t /4) + c/2 = (-c/4 + c/2) + (c t)/4 = c/4 + (c t)/4

Thus,

c t = c/4 + (c t)/4

Divide both sides by c (assuming c ≠ 0):

t = 1/4 + t/4

Multiply both sides by 4:

4t = 1 + t => 4t - t = 1 => 3t = 1 => t = 1/3

Therefore, t = 1/3. Thus, coordinates of M are:

x = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3

y = c * (1/3) = c/3

So M is at (2/3, c/3).

Now, check if M lies on AT. Let me verify.

Line AT connects A(0,0) to T(1, c/2). Let me parametrize line AT.

Parametric equations for AT: Starting at A(0,0), direction vector (1, c/2). So parametric equations:

x = 0 + k*1 = k

y = 0 + k*(c/2) = (k c)/2

For some parameter k.

So coordinates of M must satisfy this. From earlier, M is at (2/3, c/3). Therefore, comparing with parametric equations:

x = k = 2/3

y = (k c)/2 = (2/3)c / 2 = c/3. Which matches. Therefore, k = 2/3. So yes, M lies on AT. Perfect.

So now, we have coordinates of M as (2/3, c/3).

Now, we can compute the distances given:

First, MC = 7. Let's compute distance between M(2/3, c/3) and C(0, c).

Distance squared: (0 - 2/3)^2 + (c - c/3)^2 = (4/9) + ( (2c/3)^2 ) = 4/9 + (4c²)/9 = (4 + 4c²)/9

So sqrt( (4 + 4c²)/9 ) = sqrt(4(1 + c²))/3 = (2 sqrt(1 + c²))/3

This is supposed to be equal to 7.

So:

(2 sqrt(1 + c²))/3 = 7 ⇒ sqrt(1 + c²) = 21/2 ⇒ square both sides:

1 + c² = (441)/4 ⇒ c² = 441/4 - 1 = 441/4 - 4/4 = 437/4 ⇒ c = sqrt(437)/2 ≈ ?

Not sure if needed yet. Let me keep it symbolic for now.

Next, distance MR = 4. Let's compute distance between M(2/3, c/3) and R(0, c/2).

Compute distance squared:

(0 - 2/3)^2 + (c/2 - c/3)^2 = (4/9) + ( (3c/6 - 2c/6 ))^2 = 4/9 + (c/6)^2 = 4/9 + c²/36.

Which is equal to:

(16/36) + c²/36 = (16 + c²)/36

Take square root:

sqrt( (16 + c²)/36 ) = sqrt(16 + c²)/6

Set equal to 4:

sqrt(16 + c²)/6 = 4 ⇒ sqrt(16 + c²) = 24 ⇒ square both sides:

16 + c² = 576 ⇒ c² = 576 - 16 = 560 ⇒ c² = 560.

Earlier, from MC = 7, we had c² = 437/4. Wait, but that contradicts c² = 560. Wait, that can't be. There's inconsistency here. Which suggests that my assumption of coordinates may have errors, or miscalculations.

Wait, let me recheck.

First, from MC = 7:

Computed distance squared was (4 + 4c²)/9. Wait, wait:

Original calculation:

Between M(2/3, c/3) and C(0, c):

Δx = 0 - 2/3 = -2/3

Δy = c - c/3 = 2c/3

So squared distance: ( (-2/3)^2 + (2c/3)^2 ) = 4/9 + 4c²/9 = (4 + 4c²)/9. Correct.

Then sqrt( (4 + 4c²)/9 ) = 2*sqrt(1 + c²)/3. Set equal to 7:

2√(1 + c²)/3 = 7 ⇒ √(1 + c²) = 21/2 ⇒ square: 1 + c² = 441/4 ⇒ c² = 441/4 - 1 = (441 - 4)/4 = 437/4. So c² = 437/4.

From MR = 4:

Distance between M(2/3, c/3) and R(0, c/2):

Δx = 0 - 2/3 = -2/3

Δy = c/2 - c/3 = (3c - 2c)/6 = c/6

Squared distance: ( (-2/3)^2 + (c/6)^2 ) = 4/9 + c²/36

Convert to common denominator:

4/9 = 16/36, so total is (16 + c²)/36.

Then sqrt( (16 + c²)/36 ) = sqrt(16 + c²)/6 = 4.

Thus sqrt(16 + c²) = 24 ⇒ 16 + c² = 576 ⇒ c² = 560.

But previously, from MC = 7, c² = 437/4 ≈ 109.25. But from MR = 4, c² = 560. Contradiction! Therefore, there's a mistake here.

Hmm. Where did I go wrong?

Possibly in assuming coordinates. Maybe my coordinate assignments were flawed. Alternatively, maybe my assumption that S is midpoint of BA is incorrect? Wait, no, because SA = SB. If S is on BA and SA = SB, then S must be midpoint. Unless BA is not a line segment but extended.

Wait, but even if BA is extended, if S is on BA (the line) such that SA = SB, then S would be located at the midpoint of BA if BA is a segment. But if BA is extended, then S could be outside BA. For example, if S is beyond A, then SA would be the distance from S to A, and SB would be SA + AB. Setting SA = SB would imply SA = SA + AB → AB = 0, impossible. Similarly for beyond B. Therefore, S must be midpoint of BA. Hence, my previous conclusion holds.

Therefore, contradiction arises from the coordinates. Which suggests that my coordinate setup has inconsistencies. Perhaps because I fixed coordinates for A, B, C arbitrarily, leading to conflicting results. Therefore, I need to resolve this inconsistency.

Alternative approach: Let me denote variables without fixing coordinates.

Let me denote:

Let’s define variables for coordinates:

Let me assume coordinates as follows:

Let me take A(0, 0), B(2b, 0), so that midpoint S is at (b, 0). Let me take C(0, c), so that coordinates are manageable.

Then, as before:

- R is midpoint of CA: (0, c/2)

- T is midpoint of CB: midpoint between C(0,c) and B(2b, 0) is ((0 + 2b)/2, (c + 0)/2) = (b, c/2)

So T is at (b, c/2)

Then line SC connects S(b, 0) to C(0, c). Parametric equations: same as before.

Point M lies on SC, BR, and AT. Earlier computation gave coordinates of M as (2/3, c/3) when b=1? Wait, no, in that case, I assumed b=1, but actually in general, with A(0,0), B(2b,0), then coordinates of S is (b,0), and coordinates of C(0,c).

Then line SC is from S(b,0) to C(0,c). Direction vector is (-b, c). Parametric equations: x = b - bt, y = 0 + ct, where t ∈ [0,1]. So general point on SC is (b(1 - t), ct).

Line BR connects B(2b, 0) to R(0, c/2). The parametric equations for BR: starting at B(2b, 0), direction vector is (-2b, c/2). So parametric equations: x = 2b - 2b*s, y = 0 + (c/2)s, where s ∈ [0,1].

Intersection point M must satisfy both SC and BR equations. So:

From SC: x = b(1 - t), y = ct.

From BR: x = 2b - 2b s, y = (c/2)s.

Setting equal:

b(1 - t) = 2b - 2b s → divide both sides by b: 1 - t = 2 - 2s → rearranged: 2s - t = 1.

And ct = (c/2)s → divide both sides by c (assuming c ≠ 0): t = s/2.

Substituting t = s/2 into 2s - t = 1:

2s - s/2 = 1 → (4s/2 - s/2) = 3s/2 = 1 → s = 2/3.

Then t = s/2 = 1/3.

Thus, coordinates of M from SC: x = b(1 - 1/3) = (2b)/3, y = c*(1/3) = c/3. So M is at (2b/3, c/3).

Now, check if M lies on AT.

Line AT connects A(0,0) to T(b, c/2). Parametric equations: x = k*b, y = k*(c/2), where k ∈ [0,1].

So for M(2b/3, c/3), we have:

x = 2b/3 = k*b → k = 2/3.

Then y = (2/3)*(c/2) = c/3, which matches. So yes, M lies on AT. Great.

So coordinates of M are (2b/3, c/3).

Now, compute distances MC and MR.

First, distance MC: between M(2b/3, c/3) and C(0, c).

Δx = 0 - 2b/3 = -2b/3

Δy = c - c/3 = 2c/3

Distance squared: ( (-2b/3)^2 + (2c/3)^2 ) = (4b²/9 + 4c²/9) = 4(b² + c²)/9.

So distance MC = 2√(b² + c²)/3 = 7 (given).

Second, distance MR: between M(2b/3, c/3) and R(0, c/2).

Δx = 0 - 2b/3 = -2b/3

Δy = c/2 - c/3 = (3c - 2c)/6 = c/6

Distance squared: ( (-2b/3)^2 + (c/6)^2 ) = 4b²/9 + c²/36

Combine terms:

Convert to common denominator 36:

4b²/9 = 16b²/36

So total distance squared is (16b² + c²)/36

Thus, distance MR = sqrt(16b² + c²)/6 = 4 (given).

So:

sqrt(16b² + c²)/6 = 4 → sqrt(16b² + c²) = 24 → square both sides: 16b² + c² = 576.

Also, from MC = 7:

2√(b² + c²)/3 = 7 → √(b² + c²) = 21/2 → square: b² + c² = 441/4.

So now we have two equations:

1. b² + c² = 441/4

2. 16b² + c² = 576

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2:

(16b² + c²) - (b² + c²) = 576 - 441/4

→ 15b² = 576 - 110.25 (since 441/4 = 110.25)

Calculate RHS:

576 - 110.25 = 465.75

Which is 465.75 = 15b² → b² = 465.75 / 15 = 31.05

Wait, exact fraction:

Original subtraction:

Equation 2: 16b² + c² = 576

Equation 1: b² + c² = 441/4

Subtract: 15b² = 576 - 441/4

Convert 576 to fourths: 576 = 2304/4

So 2304/4 - 441/4 = (2304 - 441)/4 = 1863/4

Hence, 15b² = 1863/4 → b² = (1863/4)/15 = 1863/(60) = Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 621/20

So b² = 621/20.

Now, from equation 1: b² + c² = 441/4 → c² = 441/4 - b² = 441/4 - 621/20.

Convert to common denominator:

441/4 = 2205/20

So c² = 2205/20 - 621/20 = (2205 - 621)/20 = 1584/20 = 396/5.

So c² = 396/5.

Now, our goal is to find MS.

Point M is at (2b/3, c/3), and point S is at (b, 0).

So distance MS is between (2b/3, c/3) and (b, 0).

Δx = b - 2b/3 = b/3

Δy = 0 - c/3 = -c/3

Distance squared: (b/3)^2 + (-c/3)^2 = (b² + c²)/9.

From equation 1, b² + c² = 441/4.

So distance MS = sqrt( (441/4)/9 ) = sqrt(441/36) = 21/6 = 3.5.

Ah! So MS = 21/6 = 3.5, which is 3.5. Looking at the answer choices, option B is 3.5.

So the answer is B.

But let me confirm once again.

Yes, MS distance squared is (b² + c²)/9 = (441/4)/9 = 441/(36) = 49/4. Wait, wait:

Wait, 441 divided by 36: 441 ÷ 36 = 12.25, which is 49/4. Wait, 441/36 simplifies as:

Divide numerator and denominator by 9: 49/4. Yes. So sqrt(49/4) = 7/2 = 3.5. Correct.

So MS = 3.5, which corresponds to option B.

Therefore, the correct answer is B.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ MS $, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration described by the constraints and deducing relationships among the points. Here's a structured breakdown of the reasoning and solution steps:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Setup**

The key geometric constraints include:

- $ MC = 7 $
- $ MR = 4 $
- $ M \in \text{line } SC $, $ M \in \text{line } BR $, $ M \in \text{line } AT $
- $ S \in \text{line } BA $, with $ SA = SB $ → **$ S $ is the midpoint of $ BA $**
- $ R \in \text{line } CA $, with $ AR = RC $ → **$ R $ is the midpoint of $ CA $**
- $ T \in \text{line } CB $, with $ CT = TB $ → **$ T $ is the midpoint of $ CB $**

These observations allow us to assign coordinates strategically to simplify computations.

---

### **Step 2: Assign Coordinates**

Choose convenient coordinates to represent the points:

- Let $ A = (0, 0) $
- Let $ B = (2b, 0) $, so that $ S $, the midpoint of $ BA $, is at $ (b, 0) $
- Let $ C = (0, c) $, so that:
  - $ R $, the midpoint of $ CA $, is at $ (0, c/2) $
  - $ T $, the midpoint of $ CB $, is at $ (b, c/2) $

Now, we find the coordinates of point $ M $, which lies on the intersections of:

- Line $ SC $
- Line $ BR $
- Line $ AT $

---

### **Step 3: Determine Coordinates of Point $ M $**

Using the parametric forms of the lines:

#### Line $ SC $:  
From $ S = (b, 0) $ to $ C = (0, c) $, parametrically:
$$
x = b(1 - t),\quad y = ct
$$

#### Line $ BR $:  
From $ B = (2b, 0) $ to $ R = (0, c/2) $, parametrically:
$$
x = 2b(1 - s),\quad y = (c/2)s
$$

#### Line $ AT $:  
From $ A = (0, 0) $ to $ T = (b, c/2) $, parametrically:
$$
x = bk,\quad y = (c/2)k
$$

By matching the expressions for $ x $ and $ y $, and solving the resulting system, we find that the point $ M $ lies at:
$$
M = \left(\frac{2b}{3}, \frac{c}{3} \right)
$$

---

### **Step 4: Use Distance Constraints to Solve for $ b $ and $ c $**

**Given:**  
- $ MC = 7 $
- $ MR = 4 $

Use the coordinates of $ M = \left(\frac{2b}{3}, \frac{c}{3}\right) $ and $ C = (0, c) $:

$$
MC = \sqrt{(0 - \frac{2b}{3})^2 + (c - \frac{c}{3})^2}
= \sqrt{\frac{4b^2}{9} + \frac{4c^2}{9}} 
= \frac{2}{3} \sqrt{b^2 + c^2}
$$

Set this equal to 7:
$$
\frac{2}{3} \sqrt{b^2 + c^2} = 7 \Rightarrow \sqrt{b^2 + c^2} = \frac{21}{2}
\Rightarrow b^2 + c^2 = \left(\frac{21}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{441}{4}
\tag{1}
$$

Now calculate $ MR = 4 $, using $ M = \left(\frac{2b}{3}, \frac{c}{3}\right) $, $ R = (0, c/2) $:

$$
MR = \sqrt{(0 - \frac{2b}{3})^2 + (\frac{c}{2} - \frac{c}{3})^2}
= \sqrt{\frac{4b^2}{9} + \left(\frac{c}{6}\right)^2}
= \sqrt{\frac{4b^2}{9} + \frac{c^2}{36}}
$$

Set this equal to 4:
$$
\sqrt{\frac{4b^2}{9} + \frac{c^2}{36}} = 4 \Rightarrow \frac{4b^2}{9} + \frac{c^2}{36} = 16
$$

Multiply through by 36 to eliminate denominators:
$$
16b^2 + c^2 = 576
\tag{2}
$$

### **Step 5: Compute $ MS $**

Now, use the known relationship $ b^2 + c^2 = \frac{441}{4} $ (from equation (1)) and substitute into equation (2):

From equation (2):
$$
16b^2 + c^2 = 576 \\
\Rightarrow 15b^2 = 576 - \frac{441}{4} = \frac{2304}{4} - \frac{441}{4} = \frac{1863}{4} \\
\Rightarrow b^2 = \frac{621}{20}
$$

Then,
$$
c^2 = \frac{441}{4} - b^2 = \frac{441}{4} - \frac{621}{20} = \frac{2205 - 621}{20} = \frac{1584}{20} = \frac{396}{5}
$$

Finally, compute $ MS $:

$$
MS = \sqrt{(b - \frac{2b}{3})^2 + (0 - \frac{c}{3})^2}
= \sqrt{\left(\frac{b}{3}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{c}{3}\right)^2}
= \frac{1}{3} \sqrt{b^2 + c^2}
$$

From equation (1):
$$
MS = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{21}{2} = \frac{21}{6} = 3.5
$$
