====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. The problem involves a parallelogram and some lengths given as expressions with variables a and b. I need to find the value of b. Let me start by recalling the properties of a parallelogram.

In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in length. Also, opposite angles are equal, and consecutive angles are supplementary. But since we're dealing with side lengths here, maybe the key property is that opposite sides are congruent.

Wait, but the problem mentions lines between points X, Y, W, Z. Let me try to visualize the parallelogram. Let me assume that the points form a parallelogram. So, perhaps the vertices are X, Y, Z, W? Or maybe another order?

But the problem gives four line segments:

- Length of Line(X,Y) = 3a + 7
- Length of Line(X,W) = b + 11
- Length of Line(W,Z) = 4a
- Length of Line(Y,Z) = 2b

Hmm. If it's a parallelogram, then opposite sides should be equal. Let me think about which sides are opposite.

Assuming the parallelogram is named XYZW, so the sides would be XY, YZ, ZW, and WX. Wait, but the lines mentioned are XY, XW, WZ, and YZ. Let me check:

If the figure is a parallelogram, then XY should be parallel and equal to WZ, and XW should be parallel and equal to YZ. Because in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal.

So according to that:

XY equals WZ, and XW equals YZ.

Given that, let's write down equations based on the given expressions.

First, XY is given as 3a + 7. And WZ is given as 4a. Since they are opposite sides, they should be equal. Therefore:

3a + 7 = 4a

Solving for a:

Subtract 3a from both sides: 7 = a. So a = 7.

Then, moving on to the other pair of opposite sides: XW and YZ.

XW is given as b + 11, and YZ is given as 2b. Setting them equal:

b + 11 = 2b

Subtract b from both sides: 11 = b.

Therefore, b = 11. Looking at the answer choices, option B is 11. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure that the sides I compared are indeed opposite. Let me confirm the structure again.

If the parallelogram is X-Y-Z-W connected in order, then sides are XY, YZ, ZW, and WX. Then opposite sides are XY and ZW (which are the ones we equated), and YZ and WX (the other pair). So yes, that matches the given lines. So the equations are correct.

Alternatively, if the points were arranged differently, like X, W, Y, Z or something else, the relationships might change. But since the problem refers to Line(X,Y), Line(X,W), etc., maybe the configuration is such that X is connected to Y and W, making X a vertex connected to two others. In a parallelogram, each vertex has two adjacent sides. So for example, if the parallelogram is X connected to Y and W, then Y is connected to X and Z, W is connected to X and Z, and Z is connected to Y and W. Wait, that might form a parallelogram. Let me sketch mentally:

Points X, Y, Z, W forming a parallelogram. Suppose sides are XY and XW as adjacent sides. Then the opposite sides would be YZ and WX. Wait, no. If XY and XW are adjacent sides, then the opposite of XY would be WZ, and opposite of XW would be YZ.

Yes, so XY opposite to WZ, and XW opposite to YZ. Which is exactly the pairs we considered earlier. So our equations are correct.

Thus, solving 3a + 7 = 4a gives a=7, then substituting into the second equation: b + 11 = 2b => b=11. So answer is B.

Let me check if there's any alternative way this could be interpreted. For instance, if the lines given aren't the sides but diagonals or something else. But the problem says "use parallelogram", so likely referring to sides. Also, if they were diagonals, the properties would differ. However, in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other but aren't necessarily equal unless it's a rectangle. But since the problem gives us expressions for lengths, and asks to find b, it's more straightforward that these are sides.

Another check: if a=7, then XY length is 3*7 +7= 21 +7=28. And WZ is 4a=28. That checks out. Then for XW: b +11 and YZ: 2b. If b=11, then XW is 11+11=22, and YZ is 2*11=22. Also checks out. All conditions satisfied. So answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ b $ using the given geometric constraints involving a **parallelogram**, we begin by analyzing the fundamental property of **opposite sides being equal** in a parallelogram. This allows us to set up equations based on the given expressions for the side lengths.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Structure

We are told that the following lengths correspond to line segments in a parallelogram:

- $ \text{Length}(X, Y) = 3a + 7 $
- $ \text{Length}(X, W) = b + 11 $
- $ \text{Length}(W, Z) = 4a $
- $ \text{Length}(Y, Z) = 2b $

These represent the distances between the vertices of a quadrilateral. Assuming the shape forms a **parallelogram**, its **opposite sides are equal**. Thus:

- Opposite sides $ XY $ and $ WZ $ must be equal.
- Opposite sides $ XW $ and $ YZ $ must also be equal.

---

### Step 2: Set Up Equations Based on Equal Sides

Using the equality of opposite sides:

#### Equation 1: From $ XY = WZ $
$$
3a + 7 = 4a
$$
Solving for $ a $:
$$
7 = a
$$

#### Equation 2: From $ XW = YZ $
$$
b + 11 = 2b
$$
Solving for $ b $:
$$
11 = b
$$

---

### Step 3: Final Verification

Now substitute back:

- $ a = 7 $:  
  - $ XY = 3a + 7 = 21 + 7 = 28 $  
  - $ WZ = 4a = 28 $ → Verified.

- $ b = 11 $:  
  - $ XW = b + 11 = 22 $  
  - $ YZ = 2b = 22 $ → Verified.

All conditions are satisfied, confirming the solution.

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\text{B}}
