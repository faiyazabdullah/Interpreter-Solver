MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, so I need to find the measure of angle PSR in an equilateral pentagon PQRST inscribed in a circle with center U and radius 5.0. Let me start by recalling some concepts about cyclic polygons and regular polygons.

First, since all points P, Q, R, S, T lie on the same circle (they're all on the circle centered at U), the pentagon is cyclic. But it's also mentioned that the pentagon is equilateral, meaning all sides are equal. However, for a regular pentagon, both sides and angles are equal, but here it's only specified as equilateral. Wait, does that mean all sides are equal but angles can vary? Or maybe there's more to it?

Wait, no—actually, in a cyclic polygon, if all sides are equal, then it's called an equilateral cyclic polygon. For regular polygons, they are both equiangular and equilateral. But in this case, the pentagon is just equilateral. So, maybe it's not necessarily regular. Hmm, but since it's cyclic and equilateral, perhaps there are certain properties we can use.

But wait, in a regular pentagon, each central angle would be 360/5 = 72 degrees. The internal angles of a regular pentagon are 108 degrees. However, the question is about angle PSR. Let me visualize the pentagon. Points P, Q, R, S, T are on the circle. Let me think about how the vertices are arranged.

Let me try to imagine or sketch a diagram mentally. Suppose the pentagon is labeled in order P, Q, R, S, T around the circle. Then angle PSR would be formed by connecting points P, S, R. Wait, point S is connected to R and T? Wait, the angle at S between points P, S, R. Wait, no—if the pentagon is PQRST, then the vertices are connected in order: P-Q-R-S-T-P. Therefore, the angle at vertex S would be angle QSR? Wait, no—the angle at S would be between points Q, S, T. But the question is asking for angle PSR, which is the angle at point S between points P, S, R. That suggests that the sides SP and SR form the angle. So, in terms of the pentagon structure, SP connects S to P, which skips some vertices. Similarly, SR connects S to R. Wait, but in the pentagon, moving from S to T to P? Wait, maybe my mental image isn't accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the pentagon is not convex? Wait, but inscribed in a circle implies it's a convex polygon because all vertices lie on the circumference. So, the pentagon is convex and cyclic, with all sides equal. Now, angle PSR is an internal angle? Or maybe not. Wait, let me clarify.

In a standard pentagon, each internal angle can be calculated using the formula ((n-2)*180)/n. For n=5, that gives 108 degrees. But that's for a regular pentagon. However, here the pentagon is equilateral but not necessarily regular. So, the internal angles might differ. But since it's cyclic, there might be relations between the arcs subtended by the sides.

Since the pentagon is cyclic and equilateral, all its sides are chords of the circle. Each side length is equal. In a circle, the length of a chord depends on the central angle subtended by the chord. Since all sides are equal, their corresponding central angles must be equal. Therefore, each side corresponds to the same arc measure. Let me denote the central angle for each side as θ. Since there are five sides, the total central angles add up to 360 degrees. Hence, 5θ = 360°, so θ = 72°. Therefore, each side subtends a central angle of 72 degrees. 

So, each side of the pentagon corresponds to a 72-degree arc. Therefore, the arc between consecutive points (like P to Q, Q to R, etc.) is 72 degrees. Now, angle PSR is an inscribed angle. Wait, but which arcs does it subtend?

To find angle PSR, let's consider triangle PSR. Point S is one vertex, and points P and R are two others. To determine the measure of angle PSR, we can relate it to the arcs intercepted by the angles.

In circle geometry, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So, angle PSR is an inscribed angle intercepting some arc. Let me figure out which arc.

Angle at S between points P and R. So, the angle PSR intercepts the arc from P to R that does not contain S. Wait, in a circle, the inscribed angle at S intercepts the arc opposite to it. So, if we have points P, S, R on the circle, then angle PSR intercepts the arc PR that is opposite to S. Let me confirm that.

Yes, the inscribed angle at S intercepts the arc that is opposite, i.e., the arc from P to R that doesn't include S. The measure of angle PSR is half the measure of that arc. So, first, I need to find the measure of arc PR.

Now, let's compute the arc PR. Starting from point P, going through Q to R. Since each adjacent pair (PQ, QR, RS, ST, TP) correspond to arcs of 72 degrees each. From P to Q is 72°, Q to R is another 72°, so total from P to R via Q is 72 + 72 = 144°. Therefore, arc PR measures 144°, so the inscribed angle PSR should be half that, which is 72°. Wait, but that seems straightforward. However, let me check again.

Wait, but if the arc PR is 144°, then angle PSR is indeed half of that, which is 72°, making the answer B. But wait, hold on—is there a possibility that the intercepted arc is different?

Alternatively, sometimes when dealing with angles formed by intersecting chords, there are different cases. Let me make sure that angle PSR is indeed an inscribed angle intercepting arc PR. Let me visualize the positions:

Imagine the pentagon labeled clockwise as P, Q, R, S, T on the circle. So starting at P, then Q, R, S, T, back to P. The angle at S is between points P, S, R. So, SP connects S to P, which is three steps away from S (since S is connected to R and T; going backward from S, the previous point is T, then R, then Q, then P). Wait, so from S to P goes through T and Q? Wait, no. If the pentagon is labeled sequentially, then moving from S to P would go through T and then P? Wait, actually, depending on the direction. Let me think again.

If the pentagon is P-Q-R-S-T-P, then the order around the circle is P, then Q next, then R, then S, then T, then back to P. So, the arc from S to P would pass through T and then P. Alternatively, the minor arc SP could be the shorter path. However, when considering the angle at S, the intercepted arc is determined by the position of the points. Since angle PSR is formed by chords SP and SR. So, the angle at S is formed by points P, S, R. Therefore, the intercepted arc is the arc from P to R that does not pass through S. Which would be the arc passing through Q. Because from P to R, the arc that doesn't go through S would be P to Q to R, which is two sides of the pentagon, each 72°, totaling 144°, as before.

Therefore, the measure of angle PSR is half of 144°, which is 72°, so answer B. But wait, I remember that in some cases, especially with cyclic polygons, there might be different considerations. Let me verify once more.

Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the central angle with something else. Let me calculate the arc PR again. From P to Q is 72°, Q to R is another 72°, so arc PR is 144°, yes. Thus, the inscribed angle over that arc would be 72°, so angle PSR is 72°, which would be answer B. However, let me think if there's a different approach.

Another way: in a regular pentagon, each internal angle is 108°, but here the pentagon is equilateral but not necessarily regular. However, since all sides are equal and it's cyclic, does that force it to be regular? Wait, no. For example, you can have an equilateral cyclic quadrilateral that's not a square, like a rhombus inscribed in a circle (which must be a square). Wait, no, a rhombus is cyclic only if it's a square. So, for cyclic polygons with equal sides, does that imply regularity? For triangles, yes, an equilateral triangle is regular. For quadrilaterals, a cyclic equilateral quadrilateral must be a square. But for pentagons, is that true?

Wait, suppose we have a cyclic pentagon with all sides equal. Is it necessarily regular? Probably not. There could be non-regular cyclic equilateral pentagons. However, in such cases, the central angles might still be equal. Wait, earlier reasoning said that since all sides are equal, each side corresponds to equal central angles. Therefore, each central angle is 72°, leading to the regular pentagon. Wait, but that contradicts the idea that there exists non-regular cyclic equilateral pentagons. Maybe my initial assumption is wrong?

Wait, in a circle, if all sides are equal chords, then their central angles must be equal. Because equal chords subtend equal angles at the center. Therefore, even if the polygon isn't regular, if all sides are equal chords, then each central angle is equal. Therefore, the central angles are equal, hence the arcs between each consecutive points are equal. Therefore, the entire pentagon would be regular. Therefore, the pentagon must be regular. Therefore, the measure of angle PSR would be the same as in a regular pentagon.

Wait, but in a regular pentagon, the internal angles are 108°, but angle PSR in that case... Wait, let me check. In a regular pentagon, each internal angle is 108°, but angle PSR is an internal angle. Wait, if the pentagon is regular, then angle at S would be the internal angle, which is 108°, but according to our previous calculation, we thought it was 72°. There's a contradiction here. Which means I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, so there's a conflict here. If the pentagon is regular, then angle PSR is an internal angle of the pentagon, which is 108°, but according to the inscribed angle logic, it was 72°. So, which is correct?

Ah! Here's the confusion. The angle PSR is either an internal angle of the pentagon or an inscribed angle. Wait, in the regular pentagon, angle at S is the internal angle between sides QS and TS. But the angle PSR is between SP and SR. Wait, in the regular pentagon, SP would be a diagonal, not a side. So, in the regular pentagon, the internal angle at S is between the sides SQ and ST, but angle PSR is formed by SP and SR, which are diagonals. So, angle PSR is not the internal angle of the pentagon, but rather another angle formed by connecting non-consecutive vertices.

Therefore, my earlier approach was incorrect. The angle PSR is not the internal angle of the pentagon, but an angle formed by connecting P to S and R to S, which are diagonals. Therefore, I need to re-examine the relationship between these lines and the arcs they subtend.

Let me try again. So, angle PSR is an inscribed angle. Let me find the arc that it intercepts. As before, angle at S between P and R. So, the intercepted arc is the arc from P to R that doesn't include S. Earlier, I thought that arc was 144°, leading to 72°, but that conflicts with the regular pentagon's properties. Let me check with regular pentagon.

In a regular pentagon, each side subtends a central angle of 72°, as 360/5 = 72. The arc from P to R would be two sides apart, so 2*72 = 144°, so the inscribed angle would be half that, 72°, but in reality, what is angle PSR in a regular pentagon?

Wait, in a regular pentagon, if you connect every other vertex, forming a star, the angles involved are related to the golden ratio. However, angle PSR in a regular pentagon: let me think. Take a regular pentagon ABCDE. Let's say S is point E, and P is point C, R is point D. Wait, maybe my labeling is off. Let me take specific labels.

Suppose the regular pentagon is labeled consecutively as P, Q, R, S, T. Then, angle at S between P and R. So, points P, S, R. So, in the regular pentagon, SP would be connecting S to P, skipping Q and T? No, in a regular pentagon, connecting S to P would be a diagonal. Let me think of coordinates or use known properties.

Alternatively, in a regular pentagon, the measure of an angle formed by two diagonals can be calculated. For example, in a regular pentagon, the angle between two diagonals meeting at a vertex can be computed. However, perhaps I need to use the fact that in a regular pentagon, the central angles are 72°, and use inscribed angles.

Wait, if the arc from P to R is 144°, then the inscribed angle would be 72°, which would be angle PSR. But in a regular pentagon, what is that angle? Let me look for another method.

Alternatively, consider triangle SPR. In a regular pentagon, the lengths of SP and SR would be equal? Well, in a regular pentagon, all sides are equal, but SP and SR are diagonals. In a regular pentagon, all diagonals are equal in length. Therefore, triangle SPR would be an isoceles triangle with SP = SR. The base angles would be equal. The apex angle at S is angle PSR.

But how do we find the measure of angle PSR?

Alternatively, in a regular pentagon, the central angles are 72°, so the arc from P to R is 144°, as discussed. Therefore, the inscribed angle over that arc would be half of that, 72°, which would be angle PSR. However, in a regular pentagon, the internal angles are 108°, but angle PSR is different. So, this suggests that angle PSR is 72°, which would be answer B. But why does this contradict the idea that in a regular pentagon, internal angles are 108°?

Because angle PSR is not an internal angle of the pentagon—it's an angle formed by two diagonals. Therefore, it's a different angle. So, in that case, the measure would be 72°, so answer B. But let me verify with another approach.

Another approach: in a regular pentagon, the measure of the angle between two diagonals can be derived. For instance, in a regular pentagon, each interior angle is 108°, and the central angles are 72°. The diagonals divide the pentagon into various triangles. For example, drawing diagonals from one vertex creates a triangle with two sides being diagonals and one side being a side of the pentagon. However, angle PSR is formed by two diagonals.

Alternatively, using the formula for the angles in a cyclic polygon. Since all points lie on a circle, we can use properties of cyclic polygons. For example, in a cyclic polygon, the sum of the angles can be related to the arcs.

But perhaps I can use coordinates. Let me place the pentagon on a unit circle for simplicity, although the actual radius here is 5.0, but scaling won't affect angles. Let me assume the circle has radius r, and assign coordinates to the points.

Assume the circle is centered at the origin. Let me label the points P, Q, R, S, T in counterclockwise order. Each central angle between consecutive points is 72°, as established earlier. Let me assign coordinates based on angles.

Let’s define point P at angle 0°, so coordinates (r, 0). Then, point Q is at 72°, point R at 144°, point S at 216°, point T at 288°, and back to P at 360°=0°.

Now, angle PSR is the angle at point S between points P, S, R. So, let's find the coordinates:

Point S is at 216°, so coordinates (r cos 216°, r sin 216°).

Point R is at 144°, coordinates (r cos 144°, r sin 144°).

Point P is at 0°, coordinates (r, 0).

We need to compute angle at S between P and R.

To compute this angle, we can use vector analysis. Compute vectors SP and SR, then find the angle between them.

Vector SP = P - S = (r - r cos 216°, 0 - r sin 216°)

Vector SR = R - S = (r cos 144° - r cos 216°, r sin 144° - r sin 216°)

Then, the angle between SP and SR can be found using the dot product:

cos(theta) = (SP · SR) / (|SP| |SR|)

Let me compute this.

First, compute coordinates numerically. Let me set r = 1 for simplicity.

Compute coordinates:

Point S: 216°, cos(216°) = cos(180°+36°) = -cos(36°) ≈ -0.8090, sin(216°) = -sin(36°) ≈ -0.5878.

Point R: 144°, cos(144°) = cos(180°-36°) = -cos(36°) ≈ -0.8090, sin(144°) = sin(36°) ≈ 0.5878.

Point P: (1, 0).

Vector SP: P - S = (1 - (-0.8090), 0 - (-0.5878)) = (1 + 0.8090, 0.5878) ≈ (1.8090, 0.5878)

Vector SR: R - S = (-0.8090 - (-0.8090), 0.5878 - (-0.5878)) = (0, 1.1756)

Wait, that's interesting. The x-component of SR is zero? Let me check:

cos(144°) - cos(216°): cos(144°) is -cos(36°), cos(216°) is also -cos(36°), so difference is 0. Yes, that's right. And y-component: sin(144°) - sin(216°) = sin(144°) - sin(216°) = sin(144°) + sin(36°) because sin(216°)=sin(180°+36°)=-sin(36°). So sin(144°)=sin(36°), so total is sin(36°)+sin(36°)=2*sin(36°)≈2*0.5878≈1.1756. Correct.

So vector SR is (0, 1.1756). Vector SP is approximately (1.8090, 0.5878).

Now, compute the angle between these vectors.

The dot product SP · SR = (1.8090)(0) + (0.5878)(1.1756) ≈ 0 + 0.5878 * 1.1756 ≈ let me compute that. 0.5878 * 1.1756 ≈ approx 0.5878 * 1.1756 ≈ roughly 0.69 (exact value?)

Alternatively, exact values using trigonometric identities.

But let me proceed with approximate numbers.

Dot product ≈ 0.69.

Magnitude of SP: sqrt((1.809)^2 + (0.5878)^2) ≈ sqrt(3.272 + 0.345) ≈ sqrt(3.617) ≈ 1.902.

Magnitude of SR: sqrt(0^2 + (1.1756)^2) = 1.1756.

Thus, cos(theta) ≈ 0.69 / (1.902 * 1.1756) ≈ 0.69 / (2.237) ≈ ~0.308.

What angle has cosine ≈ 0.308? Cos(72°) ≈ 0.3090, which matches closely. Therefore, theta ≈ 72°, confirming the earlier conclusion. So angle PSR is 72°, which is answer B.

This aligns with the calculation using the inscribed angle theorem, where the intercepted arc was 144°, giving angle of 72°. This also confirms that even though the internal angles of the regular pentagon are 108°, the angle PSR in this case is 72°, which is an inscribed angle. Hence, the correct answer is B.

Therefore, despite initial confusion, the correct answer is B. 72 degrees.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $\angle PSR$ in an **equilateral pentagon** $PQRST$ inscribed in a circle centered at $U$, we begin by analyzing the geometric constraints and applying key principles of **cyclic polygons** and **inscribed angles**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Given Configuration

All vertices $P, Q, R, S, T$ lie on the circle centered at $U$. The pentagon is **equilateral**, meaning all its sides are equal in length. Since the pentagon is **cyclic**, its vertices all lie on the same circle, implying that all sides are **chords** of the circle.

For a cyclic polygon with equal-length sides, the central angle subtended by each side must be equal. With 5 equal chords dividing the full circle (360°), the central angle for each side is:

$$
\theta = \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
$$

This tells us that the arc between any two consecutive vertices (e.g., $P$ to $Q$, $Q$ to $R$, etc.) measures $72^\circ$.

---

### Step 2: Determine the Intercepted Arc

We are asked to find the measure of $\angle PSR$, which is an **inscribed angle** formed at vertex $S$ by the segments $SP$ and $SR$. 

From the cyclic configuration:
- $P$ and $R$ are separated by **two sides**: $P \to Q \to R$
- The arc $PR$ thus spans two arcs of $72^\circ$, totaling:

$$
\text{Arc } PR = 2 \times 72^\circ = 144^\circ
$$

---

### Step 3: Use Inscribed Angle Theorem

An inscribed angle subtending an arc is always **half** the measure of the arc it intercepts. Therefore:

$$
m\angle PSR = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \text{arc } PR = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 144^\circ = 72^\circ
$$

---

### Final Conclusion

By leveraging the properties of cyclic polygons and the inscribed angle theorem, we conclude that the measure of $\angle PSR$ is:

$$
\boxed{72^\circ}
$$

---

### Final Answer:  
$\boxed{\text{B}}$

Final Answer: B
