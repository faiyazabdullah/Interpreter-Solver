MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find the length x, which is the length of line AC. The given information includes that angle at point B (angle CBA) is 30 degrees. Also, the length of BC is 10√3. Additionally, lines CA and CB are perpendicular. Wait, so line CA is perpendicular to line CB? That means angle at point C between CA and CB is 90 degrees? Let me visualize this.

So points A, B, and C form a triangle. But there's a right angle at point C because CA is perpendicular to CB. So triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at point C. Wait, but the angle given is at point B, which is angle CBA = 30 degrees. Hmm. Let me sketch this mentally.

In triangle ABC, right-angled at C. Therefore, angles at A and B must add up to 90 degrees. Since angle at B is 30 degrees, then angle at A would be 60 degrees. Because in a right-angled triangle, the two non-right angles sum to 90 degrees. So angle at B is 30°, angle at A is 60°, and angle at C is 90°.

Now, we can use trigonometric ratios here. Let me recall SOHCAHTOA. In a right-angled triangle, sine of an angle is opposite over hypotenuse, cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse, tangent is opposite over adjacent.

But first, let me label the sides properly. In triangle ABC, right-angled at C. So:

- Side opposite angle B (which is 30°): that would be side AC. Because angle B is at point B, so the opposite side is AC.

Wait, no. Let me think again. In triangle ABC, with right angle at C, so sides:

- AB is the hypotenuse (opposite the right angle).

- BC is one leg, adjacent to angle B.

- AC is another leg, opposite to angle B.

Wait, angle B is at vertex B. So the sides relative to angle B:

- Opposite side: AC.

- Adjacent side: BC.

- Hypotenuse: AB.

Given that angle B is 30°, so tan(angle B) = opposite / adjacent = AC / BC.

We know BC is 10√3. So tan(30°) = AC / (10√3). 

Since tan(30°) is 1/√3, so:

1/√3 = AC / (10√3)

Multiply both sides by 10√3:

AC = (1/√3) * 10√3 = 10*(√3 / √3) = 10*1 = 10.

Therefore, AC is 10 units long. So x equals 10. Looking at the answer choices, option A is 10. So the answer should be A.

Wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe using sine or cosine?

Alternatively, since angle B is 30°, hypotenuse AB can be found. For example, cos(30°) = adjacent / hypotenuse = BC / AB. So BC is 10√3, so:

cos(30°) = 10√3 / AB => AB = 10√3 / cos(30°). Cos(30°) is √3/2, so AB = 10√3 / (√3/2) )= 10√3 * 2/√3 = 20. Then AB is 20. Then using Pythagoras, AC² + BC² = AB². So AC² + (10√3)^2 = 20^2. Compute:

AC² + 300 = 400 => AC² = 100 => AC = 10. Yep, same result. So x is 10. So answer A.

Another way: Since it's a 30-60-90 triangle. In such triangles, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. The side opposite 30° is the shortest one, then the other leg is √3 times that, and hypotenuse is twice the shortest.

Here, angle B is 30°, so the side opposite (AC) is the shortest side. Then BC is adjacent to angle B, which would be longer. Wait, in standard 30-60-90, the side opposite 30° is the shorter leg. Here, angle B is 30°, so AC is opposite angle B, so AC is the shorter leg. Then BC is the longer leg. So the ratio would be:

shorter leg (AC) : longer leg (BC) : hypotenuse (AB) = 1 : √3 : 2.

Given BC is longer leg, which is 10√3. So longer leg is √3 times the shorter leg. Therefore, BC = √3 * AC. Hence,

10√3 = √3 * AC => AC = 10. Same as before. So x is 10. So answer A.

All methods lead to x being 10, so the correct answer is A.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, which represents the length of segment $ AC $, we begin by interpreting the given geometric constraints:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Triangle Configuration**

We are told that:

- $ \angle CBA = 30^\circ $
- $ \text{Length}(BC) = 10\sqrt{3} $
- Lines $ CA $ and $ CB $ are **perpendicular**, i.e., $ \angle ACB = 90^\circ $

This tells us that triangle $ ABC $ is a **right triangle** with a right angle at $ C $. Thus, triangle $ ABC $ has angles:

- $ \angle CBA = 30^\circ $
- $ \angle ACB = 90^\circ $
- $ \angle CAB = 60^\circ $ (since the angles in a triangle sum to $ 180^\circ $)

So, triangle $ ABC $ is a **30–60–90 triangle**, with the right angle at $ C $.

---

### **Step 2: Use Properties of a 30–60–90 Triangle**

In a **30–60–90 triangle**, the sides are in the fixed ratio:

$$
\text{Shortest side (opposite } 30^\circ) : \text{Middle side (opposite } 60^\circ) : \text{Longest side (hypotenuse)} = 1 : \sqrt{3} : 2
$$

From the triangle:

- $ \angle CBA = 30^\circ $, so the side **opposite** this angle is $ AC $
- $ \angle ACB = 90^\circ $, so the hypotenuse is $ AB $
- $ \angle CAB = 60^\circ $, so the side **opposite** this angle is $ BC $

Thus:

- $ AC $ is the **shortest side**
- $ BC $ is the **longer leg**
- $ AB $ is the **hypotenuse**

Given:
- $ BC = 10\sqrt{3} $

Let’s denote:
- $ AC = x $
- $ BC = 10\sqrt{3} $
- From the 30–60–90 triangle ratio:

$$
\frac{\text{Shorter leg}}{\text{Longer leg}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
$$

So:

$$
\frac{x}{10\sqrt{3}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \Rightarrow x = 10
$$

---

### **Step 3: Final Conclusion**

The value of $ x $, the length of segment $ AC $, is:

$$
x = 10
$$

---

### **Final Answer: A**  
$$
\boxed{A}
$$
