MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, and C. The problem gives some constraints:

First, the length of line BC is equal to x and also equal to y. Wait, that seems redundant unless there's more context. Maybe it's a typo? Or perhaps there's another part I'm missing? Let me check again. Oh, maybe it's saying that both LengthOf(Line(B,C)) equals x and also equals y. But then why mention both? Unless there's a mistake here. Hmm. Wait, maybe there's a misread. Let me make sure. The user wrote:

"Equals(LengthOf(Line(B, C)), x)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(B, C)), y)"

So, both x and y are equal to the length of BC? That would mean x = y. But since they're asking for x, maybe there's more information. Then we have:

"Equals(LengthOf(Line(A, C)), 10)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(A, B)), 20)
Perpendicular(Line(C, A), Line(C, B))"

So, AC is 10 units, AB is 20 units, and lines CA and CB are perpendicular. Wait, so point C is connected to A and B, and those two lines are perpendicular. So triangle ABC has a right angle at point C?

Wait, because Perpendicular(Line(C,A), Line(C,B)) means that lines CA and CB are perpendicular. Therefore, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at point C. Because the legs are CA and CB, and hypotenuse AB.

But wait, the lengths of CA is 10, CB is x (and also y). And AB is 20. Since it's a right triangle, Pythagoras' theorem applies. So, in a right triangle, the sum of squares of the legs equals the square of the hypotenuse.

Therefore, CA² + CB² = AB².

Plugging in the numbers: CA is 10, so 10² + x² = 20².

Calculating that: 100 + x² = 400 → x² = 400 - 100 = 300 → x = sqrt(300) = sqrt(100*3) = 10√3. 

Looking at the answer choices, option C is 10√3. So that should be the answer. But let me double-check everything.

Wait, but the problem says that LengthOf(Line(B,C)) equals x and also equals y. But since the problem only asks for x, which is the same as y. So maybe there was a mistake in the problem statement, but regardless, according to the given data, BC is x, and using Pythagoras, x is 10√3. Hence, the answer should be C.

Alternatively, could there be something wrong with my assumption? Let me confirm. The right angle is at C, so yes, CA and CB are the legs. AB is the hypotenuse. So yes, the calculation holds. Therefore, x is 10√3. Which matches option C. So Final Answer: C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we begin by analyzing the given geometric constraints:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**

We are told:

- $ \text{Length}(BC) = x $
- $ \text{Length}(AC) = 10 $
- $ \text{Length}(AB) = 20 $
- $ \angle ACB = 90^\circ $ (since lines $ CA $ and $ CB $ are perpendicular)

This implies that triangle $ ABC $ is a **right triangle** with the right angle at point $ C $. Thus, sides $ AC $ and $ CB $ are the **legs**, and side $ AB $ is the **hypotenuse**.

---

### **Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**

In a right triangle, the relationship between the sides is governed by the Pythagorean Theorem:

$$
\text{(Leg}_1)^2 + \text{(Leg}_2)^2 = \text{(Hypotenuse)}^2
$$

Let’s denote:

- $ AC = 10 $,
- $ BC = x $,
- $ AB = 20 $

Substitute into the equation:

$$
AC^2 + BC^2 = AB^2 \\
10^2 + x^2 = 20^2 \\
100 + x^2 = 400
$$

Now solve for $ x $:

$$
x^2 = 400 - 100 = 300 \\
x = \sqrt{300} = \sqrt{100 \cdot 3} = 10\sqrt{3}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Select the Correct Answer**

The computed value of $ x $ is $ 10\sqrt{3} $, which corresponds to **Option C**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
$$
\boxed{\text{C}}
$$
