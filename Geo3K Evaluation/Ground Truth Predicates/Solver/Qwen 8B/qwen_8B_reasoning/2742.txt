MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, we have several points A, B, C, D with some given lengths and perpendicularity conditions. The goal is to find the value of y, which is the length of line BD. Let me start by jotting down all the given information and see how I can relate them.

First, the given constraints:

- Length of BD is y.
- Length of AB is z.
- Length of CD is x.
- Length of AD is 8.8 units.
- Length of BC is 8.5 units.
- Point D lies on line AC.
- Line DB is perpendicular to DA.
- Line AB is perpendicular to BC.

Hmm, okay. Let me visualize this. Since D lies on AC, maybe triangle ABC has point D somewhere along its side AC? Also, there are perpendicular lines involved. Let me think about coordinates. Coordinates might help here because dealing with perpendicular slopes and distances could be easier that way.

Let me assign coordinates to the points. Let's assume coordinate system for simplicity. Maybe place point A at (0, 0). Then since DA is part of line AC, and D lies on AC, perhaps I can define coordinates based on that.

But first, considering the perpendicularity. Line AB is perpendicular to BC. So angle at B between AB and BC is 90 degrees. That suggests that triangle ABC is right-angled at B. Wait, but then AB is perpendicular to BC, so yes, triangle ABC is right-angled at B. Therefore, AB and BC are the legs, and AC is the hypotenuse.

So, if I consider triangle ABC with right angle at B, then AC² = AB² + BC². But wait, AB is z, BC is 8.5, so AC would be sqrt(z² + 8.5²). However, we also know that D lies on AC. And there's another condition involving perpendicularity: line DB is perpendicular to DA. So, line DB is perpendicular to DA. Which means that vectors DB and DA are perpendicular. Alternatively, in terms of coordinates, their slopes multiply to -1.

Let me try to set up coordinates. Let me fix coordinates for points A, B, C first, then figure out D.

Since ABC is right-angled at B, let's set coordinates as follows:

Let’s place point B at (0, 0) because it's the right angle. Then, since AB is perpendicular to BC, let me take AB along the y-axis and BC along the x-axis. Wait, but if AB is perpendicular to BC, then AB could be vertical and BC horizontal. Let me confirm:

If AB is vertical (along y-axis) and BC is horizontal (along x-axis), then point A would be somewhere along the y-axis, point B at origin, and point C along the x-axis. Let me write coordinates:

Let’s say:

- Point B: (0, 0)

- Since AB is vertical, let’s say point A is at (0, z), because AB length is z.

- Since BC is horizontal, point C would be at (c, 0), where c is the length BC. Wait, BC is given as 8.5, so c = 8.5. So point C is (8.5, 0).

Then, AC connects point A (0, z) to point C (8.5, 0). The equation of line AC can be parametrized. Any point D lying on AC can be expressed as a weighted average between A and C.

Now, point D lies on AC. Let me parametrize D. Let's denote parameter t such that D divides AC in ratio t:(1-t), but maybe better to use a parameter s ∈ [0,1], so coordinates of D would be:

x-coordinate: 0 + s*(8.5 - 0) = 8.5s

y-coordinate: z + s*(0 - z) = z(1 - s)

Therefore, coordinates of D are (8.5s, z(1 - s)).

Also, we have another condition: line DB is perpendicular to DA. Let's translate this into equations.

Vector DA is from D to A: A - D = (0 - 8.5s, z - z(1 - s)) = (-8.5s, zs)

Wait, no. Vector DA is from D to A? Wait, no. Wait, the line DB is perpendicular to DA. So vector DB and vector DA should be perpendicular. Wait, DA is the vector from D to A? Or from A to D?

Actually, the line DA is the line segment from D to A. So the direction vector of DA is A - D. Similarly, direction vector of DB is B - D.

Wait, but the lines DB and DA are perpendicular. So the vectors DB and DA should be perpendicular. So their dot product is zero.

So vector DB = B - D = (0 - 8.5s, 0 - z(1 - s)) = (-8.5s, -z(1 - s))

Vector DA = A - D = (0 - 8.5s, z - z(1 - s)) = (-8.5s, zs)

Dot product of DB and DA should be zero:

(-8.5s)(-8.5s) + [-z(1 - s)][zs] = 0

Calculating:

(8.5s)^2 - z^2 s(1 - s) = 0

Let me compute that:

(72.25)s² - z² s(1 - s) = 0

We can factor out s:

s[72.25s - z²(1 - s)] = 0

Solutions are s=0 or 72.25s - z²(1 - s) = 0

s=0 would correspond to D=A, but since D lies on AC, but then BD would be BA, which isn't necessarily the case. So probably the non-zero solution:

72.25s - z²(1 - s) = 0

Let me rearrange:

72.25s + z² s = z²

s(72.25 + z²) = z²

Thus,

s = z² / (72.25 + z²)

So that gives us the value of s in terms of z. Now, we need more relations to connect these variables.

Additionally, we know the length of AD is 8.8. Let me recall that AD is from A to D. So the distance between A(0,z) and D(8.5s, z(1-s)).

Compute AD squared:

(8.5s - 0)^2 + [z(1 - s) - z]^2 = (8.5s)^2 + [ - z s ]^2 = (72.25)s² + z² s² = s² (72.25 + z² )

Given that AD = 8.8, so AD squared is 8.8² = 77.44

Therefore:

s² (72.25 + z² ) = 77.44

But earlier, we had s = z² / (72.25 + z² ). Therefore, substituting s into above equation:

[ z^4 / (72.25 + z² )² ] * (72.25 + z² ) = 77.44

Simplify:

z^4 / (72.25 + z² ) = 77.44

Multiply both sides by denominator:

z^4 = 77.44 (72.25 + z² )

Let me expand this:

z^4 = 77.44*72.25 + 77.44 z² 

Bring all terms to left-hand side:

z^4 - 77.44 z² - 77.44*72.25 = 0

This is a quadratic in terms of z². Let me denote u = z²:

u² - 77.44 u - 77.44*72.25 = 0

Solving quadratic equation:

u = [77.44 ± sqrt(77.44² + 4 * 77.44 * 72.25 )]/2

But since u represents z², it must be positive. So we take the positive root:

u = [77.44 + sqrt(77.44² + 4 * 77.44 * 72.25 )]/2

Let me compute discriminant:

D = 77.44² + 4 * 77.44 * 72.25

Factor out 77.44:

D = 77.44 [77.44 + 4 * 72.25 ]

Calculate 4 * 72.25 = 289. So inside the brackets: 77.44 + 289 = 366.44

Therefore, D = 77.44 * 366.44

So sqrt(D) = sqrt(77.44 * 366.44)

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a mistake here? Because solving this would require heavy computations. Perhaps there's another approach?

Alternatively, maybe we can find relation between z and other known quantities. Remember that in triangle ABC, which is right-angled at B, so AC² = AB² + BC². AB is z, BC is 8.5, so AC² = z² + 8.5². But AC is the hypotenuse. Also, since D lies on AC, and we have expressions involving s and z.

Wait, but AC is the entire length. From previous calculation, AC² = z² + 8.5². Also, the length AC can be computed as the distance between A(0,z) and C(8.5, 0):

AC² = (8.5)^2 + z^2, same as before.

But also, since D lies on AC, the total length AC can be related to AD and DC. Wait, but we don't know DC yet. However, CD is given as x. Wait, the problem says:

LengthOf(Line(C,D)) = x. So CD = x. Also, AD is 8.8. So AC = AD + DC = 8.8 + x. Hence:

sqrt(z² + 8.5²) = 8.8 + x → square both sides:

z² + 72.25 = (8.8 + x)^2

But we also have another equation from earlier when we derived z^4 = 77.44*(72.25 + z² )

Wait, but maybe combining equations can help. Let me note that:

From the previous steps, we had:

z^4 = 77.44*(72.25 + z² )

And from the AC equation:

z² + 72.25 = (8.8 + x)^2 → x = sqrt(z² + 72.25) - 8.8

But we also have CD = x, which is the length from C to D. Since D is on AC, and AC = 8.8 + x, then x = AC - AD = AC - 8.8. Therefore, AC = 8.8 + x. Which is consistent with above.

However, without knowing x, how do we proceed? Unless there's another relationship involving x?

Wait, the problem asks for y, which is BD. Let me think. BD is the length from B to D. Given that B is at (0, 0), and D is at (8.5s, z(1 - s)). So BD squared is (8.5s)^2 + [z(1 - s)]^2. Therefore, BD² = (8.5s)^2 + z²(1 - s)^2. We need to find BD = y.

But earlier, we had s = z²/(72.25 + z²). So substitute that into BD²:

BD² = (8.5s)^2 + z²(1 - s)^2

Let me compute each term:

First term: (8.5s)^2 = 72.25 s²

Second term: z²(1 - 2s + s²) = z² - 2 z² s + z² s²

Therefore, BD² = 72.25 s² + z² - 2 z² s + z² s² = z² + (72.25 + z²)s² - 2 z² s

But we already have s = z² / (72.25 + z²). Let me plug that in.

Let me denote denominator as K = 72.25 + z². Then s = z²/K.

Substitute into BD²:

BD² = z² + K*(z^4 / K²) - 2 z²*(z² / K )

Simplify:

= z² + z^4 / K - 2 z^4 / K

= z² - z^4 / K

But K = 72.25 + z², so:

BD² = z² - z^4 / (72.25 + z² )

Combine terms over common denominator:

= [z²(72.25 + z² ) - z^4 ] / (72.25 + z² )

Expand numerator:

z² * 72.25 + z^4 - z^4 = 72.25 z²

Thus BD² = (72.25 z² ) / (72.25 + z² )

Therefore, BD = sqrt( (72.25 z² ) / (72.25 + z² )) = [ z * sqrt(72.25) ] / sqrt(72.25 + z² )

Note that sqrt(72.25) is 8.5, since 8.5² = 72.25. Therefore:

BD = [ z * 8.5 ] / sqrt(72.25 + z² )

But from earlier, AC = sqrt(z² + 72.25 ), which is equal to 8.8 + x. Also, from the equation we had earlier:

z^4 = 77.44*(72.25 + z² )

Which came from AD² = 77.44 = s² * (72.25 + z² ), where s = z² / (72.25 + z² )

Wait, but we can use that equation to find z². Let me revisit that equation:

From earlier, after substitution:

z^4 = 77.44*(72.25 + z² )

Let me rearrange:

z^4 - 77.44 z² - 77.44 * 72.25 = 0

Let me denote u = z² again:

u² - 77.44 u - 77.44 * 72.25 = 0

Using quadratic formula:

u = [77.44 ± sqrt( (77.44)^2 + 4 * 77.44 * 72.25 )]/2

As before, calculate discriminant:

Inside sqrt: 77.44² + 4 * 77.44 * 72.25 = 77.44*(77.44 + 4*72.25 )

Calculate 4 * 72.25 = 289, so inside becomes 77.44 + 289 = 366.44

So sqrt(77.44 * 366.44). Let me compute this value numerically.

First, compute 77.44 * 366.44. Hmm, that's going to be tedious. Let me approximate.

Alternatively, notice that 77.44 = 8.8², since 8.8² = 77.44. And 366.44 is approximately... Well, 366.44 divided by 77.44 is roughly 4.73. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, since u = [77.44 + sqrt(...)]/2. Let me denote sqrt(77.44 * 366.44) = sqrt(77.44)*sqrt(366.44). Let me check if 366.44 relates to something else.

Wait, 366.44 = 77.44 + 4*72.25 = 77.44 + 289 = 366.44, which was earlier. But maybe I can express 77.44 as 8.8² and 72.25 as 8.5².

So sqrt(77.44 * 366.44) = sqrt(8.8² * 366.44). Not sure yet. Alternatively, maybe we can factor the expression under sqrt:

Original expression: 77.44 * 366.44. Let me compute it numerically:

First, compute 77.44 × 366.44. Let me approximate:

Well, 77.44 × 366.44 ≈ ?

Let me break it down:

First, note that 77.44 × 366.44 = ?

But this seems too big. Maybe instead of calculating exact numbers, think algebraically?

Wait, but since we're trying to find u, and then eventually BD, perhaps there's a way to avoid computing exact values. Let me think.

We have BD expressed in terms of z:

BD = [8.5 z ] / sqrt( z² + 72.25 )

Let me denote that BD = 8.5 z / AC, since AC = sqrt(z² + 72.25 )

But AC is also equal to 8.8 + x, but we don't know x. However, we also have from AD being 8.8, and CD being x. Also, from triangle ABC, AC² = z² + 8.5². Thus:

AC = sqrt(z² + 72.25 )

But BD = 8.5 z / AC. Therefore, BD² = (72.25 z²)/AC² = 72.25 z² / (z² + 72.25 )

But from earlier, we have the equation z^4 = 77.44(z² + 72.25 )

Let me divide both sides by z²:

z² = 77.44 + (77.44 * 72.25)/z²

Wait, that might not help directly. Let me think differently.

Let me call AC = L. Then L² = z² + 72.25. Also, BD = 8.5 z / L.

But from the equation z^4 = 77.44(L² )

Because z^4 = 77.44(z² + 72.25 ) = 77.44 L².

So z^4 = 77.44 L² → z² = sqrt(77.44) L → z² = 8.8 L.

Wait, sqrt(77.44) is 8.8, since 8.8² = 77.44. Yes!

So z² = 8.8 L.

But L² = z² + 72.25 → Substitute z² = 8.8 L:

L² = 8.8 L + 72.25 → L² - 8.8 L - 72.25 = 0.

Quadratic equation in L:

L = [8.8 ± sqrt( (8.8)^2 + 4 * 72.25 )]/2

Again, compute discriminant:

(8.8)^2 + 4 * 72.25 = 77.44 + 289 = 366.44

So sqrt(366.44). Let me compute sqrt(366.44). What is 19² = 361, 19.1² = 364.81, 19.15² = approx 366.7225. So sqrt(366.44) is slightly less than 19.15. Let me compute:

19.15² = (19 + 0.15)^2 = 19² + 2*19*0.15 + 0.15² = 361 + 5.7 + 0.0225 = 366.7225

Our target is 366.44, which is 366.7225 - 0.2825. So sqrt(366.44) ≈ 19.15 - (0.2825)/(2*19.15) ≈ 19.15 - 0.00736 ≈ 19.1426.

So approximate value of sqrt(366.44) ≈ 19.1426.

Thus, L = [8.8 + 19.1426]/2 ≈ (27.9426)/2 ≈ 13.9713

So L ≈ 13.9713 units.

Then, since z² = 8.8 L, z² ≈ 8.8 * 13.9713 ≈ Let me compute 8 * 13.9713 = 111.77, 0.8 * 13.9713 ≈ 11.177, total ≈ 111.77 + 11.177 ≈ 122.947. So z² ≈ 122.947, thus z ≈ sqrt(122.947) ≈ 11.09.

But maybe I can keep things symbolic. Let me go back.

We have BD = 8.5 z / L, and z² = 8.8 L → z = sqrt(8.8 L). So BD = 8.5 * sqrt(8.8 L) / L = 8.5 * sqrt(8.8)/sqrt(L)

But sqrt(8.8) is irrational, but let's see:

Alternatively, since z² = 8.8 L → z = sqrt(8.8 L)

So BD = 8.5 * sqrt(8.8 L) / L = 8.5 * sqrt(8.8)/sqrt(L)

But we also have from L² = 8.8 L + 72.25 → L² - 8.8 L - 72.25 = 0. We solved for L ≈ 13.97. So sqrt(L) ≈ sqrt(13.97) ≈ 3.737.

So BD ≈ 8.5 * sqrt(8.8)/3.737

First compute sqrt(8.8): approx 2.966

So 8.5 * 2.966 ≈ 25.211

Divide by 3.737: 25.211 / 3.737 ≈ 6.745

So BD ≈ 6.745, which is close to option C: 6.75. So likely the answer is C.

But let me verify my steps again for errors.

Wait, earlier I said that z² = 8.8 L. How did I get that? From z^4 = 77.44 L² → z² = sqrt(77.44) L. Since sqrt(77.44) = 8.8, hence z² = 8.8 L. Correct.

Then BD = (8.5 z)/L. Since z² = 8.8 L, so z = sqrt(8.8 L). Therefore BD = 8.5 * sqrt(8.8 L)/L = 8.5 * sqrt(8.8)/sqrt(L). Yes.

But then I needed to compute sqrt(L). From L ≈ 13.97, sqrt(L) ≈ 3.737.

But maybe there's a way to find BD without approximating?

Let me think again. Since BD² = (72.25 z² ) / (72.25 + z² )

But z² = 8.8 L, and L² = z² + 72.25 → substituting z² = 8.8 L into L² = 8.8 L + 72.25 → L² - 8.8 L - 72.25 = 0

Let me denote that equation again. Let me solve for L:

L = [8.8 + sqrt(8.8² + 4 * 72.25 )]/2 = [8.8 + sqrt(77.44 + 289)]/2 = [8.8 + sqrt(366.44)]/2

But sqrt(366.44) can be written as sqrt( (8.8)^2 + (8.5)^2 * 4 ) ? Wait, original numbers were 8.8 and 8.5. Wait, 72.25 is 8.5², and 77.44 is 8.8². So sqrt(366.44) = sqrt(8.8² + (2 * 8.5)^2 )? Wait 2*8.5 is 17. 17² is 289. So 8.8² + 17² = 77.44 + 289 = 366.44. Yes! So sqrt(366.44) = sqrt(8.8² + 17²). Interesting.

But maybe there's a connection here. Anyway, returning.

So BD² = (72.25 z² ) / (z² + 72.25 )

But z² = 8.8 L, so substitute:

BD² = 72.25 * 8.8 L / (8.8 L + 72.25 )

But 72.25 is 8.5², and 8.8 L comes from z². Let me substitute L from the equation L² = 8.8 L + 72.25 → L² = 8.8 L + 8.5².

But not sure. Alternatively, note that denominator is 8.8 L + 72.25 = L². So BD² = 72.25 * 8.8 L / L² = 72.25 * 8.8 / L

Thus BD² = (72.25 * 8.8)/L

But L is [8.8 + sqrt(366.44)]/2. So BD² = (72.25 * 8.8) / L.

Let me compute numerator: 72.25 * 8.8. 72.25 is 8.5², so 8.5² * 8.8. Let me compute 8.5 * 8.8 = ?

8 * 8.8 = 70.4, 0.5 * 8.8 = 4.4 → total 70.4 + 4.4 = 74.8. So 8.5² * 8.8 = 8.5 * 8.5 * 8.8 = 74.8 * 8.5 ?

Wait, no. Wait, 72.25 * 8.8 = (8.5²) * 8.8. Let me compute 8.5 * 8.8 = 74.8 as above. Then 8.5² * 8.8 = 8.5 * 74.8. Compute 8 * 74.8 = 598.4, 0.5 * 74.8 = 37.4 → total 598.4 + 37.4 = 635.8

So numerator is 635.8, so BD² = 635.8 / L.

But L = [8.8 + sqrt(366.44)] / 2 ≈ [8.8 + 19.1426]/2 ≈ 27.9426 / 2 ≈ 13.9713.

So BD² ≈ 635.8 / 13.9713 ≈ ?

Compute 635.8 ÷ 13.9713 ≈ Let me approximate 13.9713 * 45 = 628.7085, which is less than 635.8. Difference is 635.8 - 628.7085 ≈ 7.0915. So 45 + (7.0915 / 13.9713) ≈ 45 + 0.508 ≈ 45.508. So BD² ≈ 45.508, so BD ≈ sqrt(45.508) ≈ 6.746, which matches our prior estimate of ~6.75. So BD ≈ 6.75, which corresponds to option C.

Therefore, the answer should be C. 6.75.

Let me check if there's a possibility of miscalculations. For example, when I calculated BD² = 72.25 * 8.8 / L, is that correct?

Earlier steps:

BD² = (72.25 z² ) / (z² + 72.25 )

But z² = 8.8 L, so:

BD² = 72.25 * 8.8 L / (8.8 L + 72.25 )

But denominator is L², since L² = 8.8 L + 72.25.

Yes, because from earlier, L² = z² + 72.25 = 8.8 L + 72.25. So denominator is L², so BD² = (72.25 * 8.8 L)/L² = (72.25 * 8.8)/L. Correct.

So BD² = (72.25 * 8.8)/L. With L ≈ 13.9713, so BD² ≈ (72.25 * 8.8)/13.9713 ≈ 635.8 / 13.9713 ≈ 45.5, leading to BD ≈ 6.75. So option C.

Looking at answer choices, option C is 6.75. Hence, the answer is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ y $, the length of $ \overline{BD} $, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration and applying key relationships derived from the constraints.

---

### **Step 1: Coordinate Setup**

We place the points in a coordinate plane using the fact that triangle $ ABC $ is right-angled at $ B $. This allows us to position:

- $ B = (0, 0) $
- $ A = (0, z) $ (since $ AB = z $)
- $ C = (8.5, 0) $ (since $ BC = 8.5 $)

The hypotenuse $ AC $ extends from $ A $ to $ C $, and point $ D $ lies on this line.

---

### **Step 2: Parametrize Point $ D $ on Segment $ AC $**

We parametrize point $ D $ as a weighted average of points $ A $ and $ C $:

$$
D = (8.5s, z(1 - s))
$$

for some scalar $ s \in [0, 1] $.

---

### **Step 3: Use Perpendicularity Condition**

It is given that $ \overline{DB} \perp \overline{DA} $. Using vectors:

- $ \vec{DB} = B - D = (-8.5s, -z(1 - s)) $
- $ \vec{DA} = A - D = (-8.5s, zs) $

Their dot product is zero:

$$
(-8.5s)(-8.5s) + (-z(1 - s))(zs) = 0 \\
\Rightarrow 72.25s^2 - z^2s(1 - s) = 0
$$

Factoring:

$$
s(72.25s - z^2(1 - s)) = 0
$$

Ignoring the trivial solution $ s = 0 $, we solve:

$$
72.25s - z^2 + z^2s = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad s = \frac{z^2}{72.25 + z^2}
$$

### **Step 4: Use Known Distance $ AD = 8.8 $**

We use the distance formula between $ A = (0, z) $ and $ D = (8.5s, z(1 - s)) $:

$$
AD^2 = (8.5s)^2 + (z(1 - s))^2 = 72.25s^2 + z^2(1 - s)^2
$$

Plug in $ s = \frac{z^2}{72.25 + z^2} $, and simplify:

$$
AD^2 = s^2(72.25 + z^2) = 77.44
\Rightarrow s^2(72.25 + z^2) = 77.44
$$

Substituting $ s = \frac{z^2}{72.25 + z^2} $, we get:

$$
\left(\frac{z^4}{(72.25 + z^2)^2}\right)(72.25 + z^2) = 77.44 \\
\Rightarrow \frac{z^4}{72.25 + z^2} = 77.44
$$

Multiply both sides:

$$
z^4 = 77.44(72.25 + z^2)
$$

---

### **Step 5: Solve for $ z^2 $**

Rewriting:

$$
z^4 - 77.44z^2 - 77.44 \cdot 72.25 = 0
$$

Let $ u = z^2 $, then:

$$
u^2 - 77.44u - 77.44 \cdot 72.25 = 0
$$

Use the quadratic formula:

$$
u = \frac{77.44 \pm \sqrt{(77.44)^2 + 4 \cdot 77.44 \cdot 72.25}}{2}
$$

Evaluate discriminant:

$$
D = 77.44^2 + 4 \cdot 77.44 \cdot 72.25 = 77.44(77.44 + 289) = 77.44 \cdot 366.44
$$

Take square root:

$$
\sqrt{D} = \sqrt{77.44 \cdot 366.44} = \sqrt{77.44} \cdot \sqrt{366.44} = 8.8 \cdot \sqrt{366.44}
$$

Approximate:

$$
\sqrt{366.44} \approx 19.14 \Rightarrow u = \frac{77.44 + 19.14 \cdot 8.8}{2} \approx \frac{77.44 + 168.43}{2} \approx \frac{245.87}{2} = 122.935
$$

So $ z^2 \approx 122.935 $

### **Step 6: Compute $ y = |BD| $**

Recall:

$$
BD^2 = (8.5s)^2 + (z(1 - s))^2 = 72.25s^2 + z^2(1 - s)^2
$$

From earlier:

$$
BD^2 = \frac{72.25z^2}{72.25 + z^2}
$$

Substitute $ z^2 \approx 122.935 $:

$$
BD^2 = \frac{72.25 \cdot 122.935}{122.935 + 72.25} = \frac{8901.23}{195.185} \approx 45.61
\Rightarrow BD \approx \sqrt{45.61} \approx 6.75
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

After careful computation and simplification, the final value of $ y = |BD| $ is approximately **6.75**.
