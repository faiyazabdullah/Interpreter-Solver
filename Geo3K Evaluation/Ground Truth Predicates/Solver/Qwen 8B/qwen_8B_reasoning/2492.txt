Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. Hmm, first I need to parse all the given constraints and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out everything given.

So, we have points A, B, C, D, E, F, L. The problem says that AB is congruent to DF. We need to find x based on the given constraints. The answer choices are A.1, B.2, C.3, D.4.

First, let me note down all the equalities and conditions:

1. Length of CB is 9x.
2. Length of ED is 2x + 14.
3. Point L lies on line EC.
4. Point E lies on line DF.
5. Points B, D, A, F lie on a circle centered at L with radius 11.0 (so LB = LD = LA = LF = 11? Wait, no—wait, the circle is defined as Circle(L, radius_11_0). So the center is point L, and radius is 11. Therefore, any point on that circle is at distance 11 from L. Therefore, B, D, A, F are all on that circle, so their distances from L are 11. So LB = 11, LD = 11, LA = 11, LF = 11.

Wait, but then there's also Perpendicularity conditions:

- Line CL is perpendicular to CB.
- Line EL is perpendicular to EF.

So, for example, since CL is perpendicular to CB, triangle CLB is a right triangle with right angle at L. Similarly, EL is perpendicular to EF, so triangle ELF is right-angled at L.

Also, point L lies on line EC. So L is somewhere along the line connecting E and C. Also, point E lies on line DF. So E is on DF, which connects D and F.

Let me try to visualize this. Maybe drawing a diagram would help, but since I can't draw, I'll try to imagine it.

Starting with the circle centered at L with radius 11. Points B, D, A, F are on this circle. So LB = LD = LA = LF = 10? Wait, wait, the radius is 11.0. So each of those lengths is 11. So LB = 11, LD = 11, LA = 11, LF = 11.

Now, the length of CB is 9x. Since CL is perpendicular to CB, triangle CLB is right-angled at L. So CB is one leg, CL is another leg, and hypotenuse is... Wait, no. If CL is perpendicular to CB, then CL is perpendicular to CB. So point L is such that CL ⊥ CB. But since L is on line EC, maybe there's some relation here.

Similarly, for EL being perpendicular to EF. Since E is on DF, and EL is perpendicular to EF. So again, triangle ELF is right-angled at L.

But perhaps more importantly, since L is on EC, and CL is perpendicular to CB. Let me think about coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates could help.

Let me set up coordinate system. Let me assume coordinates for simplicity. Let me take L as origin (0,0) because it's the center of the circle. Then points B, D, A, F are all at distance 11 from L.

But also, since CL is perpendicular to CB. Let me consider point C. Since L lies on line EC, so line EC passes through L. Let me denote coordinates for points.

Let me suppose L is at (0,0).

Since CL is perpendicular to CB. Let me consider vector approach. Suppose point C has coordinates (c_x, c_y). Then line EC passes through L. So E is on line EC. Also, since line EC passes through L, which is the origin. So line EC can be parametrized as passing through C and E, with L lying on it. So E is a point on line EC extended beyond C or something?

Alternatively, since L is on EC, then E, L, C are colinear. So the line EC contains points E, L, and C.

Similarly, point E lies on line DF. So line DF contains point E.

Moreover, EL is perpendicular to EF. So line EL is perpendicular to line EF. Since E is on DF, and EL is perpendicular to EF, meaning that at point E, the line EL is perpendicular to EF. Which suggests that EL is the altitude from E to DF? Or maybe something else.

But perhaps coordinates will make this clearer. Let me assign coordinates step by step.

Let me fix L at (0,0). Then points B, D, A, F are on the circle centered at L with radius 11. So coordinates of these points satisfy x² + y² = 121.

Now, considering the line EC. Since L is on EC, and CL is perpendicular to CB. Let me try to express coordinates for C and B.

Suppose point C is arbitrary. Let me pick coordinates for C. Let me assume that line EC passes through L. Let me define line EC as follows: Let’s say that point C is at some position, and E is another point on the same line. Since L is between E and C? Not sure yet. Let me think.

But CL is perpendicular to CB. So vector CL · vector CB = 0. Because CL and CB are perpendicular.

Vector CL is from C to L: L - C = (-C_x, -C_y). Vector CB is from C to B: B - C = (B_x - C_x, B_y - C_y). Their dot product should be zero.

So (-C_x)(B_x - C_x) + (-C_y)(B_y - C_y) = 0.

Expanding:

-C_x B_x + C_x² - C_y B_y + C_y² = 0.

Which simplifies to C_x² + C_y² - C_x B_x - C_y B_y = 0.

But since B lies on the circle centered at L (which is origin), so B_x² + B_y² = 121. Similarly, C is some point; unless specified otherwise, its position isn't known. However, since L is on EC, which includes points E, L, and C. So maybe I can parameterize points.

Alternatively, since CL is perpendicular to CB, and L is on EC, which might imply that CL is the altitude from C to line EB or something. Not sure yet.

Alternatively, since CL is perpendicular to CB, then triangle CLB is right-angled at L. So CB^2 + CL^2 = BL^2? Wait, no. In a right triangle, the sum of squares of legs equals square of hypotenuse. Here, CL and CB are legs, right angle at L. So CL^2 + CB^2 = LB^2. Wait, LB is the length from L to B, which is 11. So:

CL² + CB² = LB² → CL² + (9x)^2 = 11² → CL² + 81x² = 121.

So CL² = 121 - 81x². That's equation one.

Similarly, looking at the other perpendicular condition: EL is perpendicular to EF. So similar logic applies. For triangle ELF, right-angled at L. So EL² + EF² = LF². Since LF is 11, as F is on the circle. And EF is the length of ED? Wait, no. Wait, the length of ED is given as 2x + 14. Wait, ED is the length of segment ED. But EF is another segment. Wait, let me check.

The problem states: Equals(LengthOf(Line(E, D)), 2x+14). So ED = 2x +14. But in the perpendicular condition, we have EL ⊥ EF. So EF is the length from E to F. So in the right triangle ELF, EL and EF are legs, hypotenuse is LF = 11. Thus:

EL² + EF² = LF² → EL² + EF² = 121. But EF is the length from E to F. However, we don't know EF directly. But maybe there's a relationship between EF and ED?

Wait, point E lies on line DF. So E is on DF. So D-F-E are colinear. So ED is part of DF. So if E is on DF, then DE + EF = DF? Depending on the order. But since E is on DF, depending on whether E is between D and F or outside. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to tell. However, since ED is given as 2x +14, and EF is part of DF, but we don't know if E is between D and F or not.

But maybe using coordinates again. Let me try to think.

Since E is on DF, and F is on the circle centered at L with radius 11. Also, EL is perpendicular to EF. So similar to before, in triangle ELF, right-angled at L, so EL² + EF² = LF² = 11². So EL² + EF² = 121. But EF is the length from E to F. However, if E is on DF, then perhaps we can express EF in terms of ED?

If E is between D and F, then DF = DE + EF. So EF = DF - DE. But DF is the entire length from D to F. But we don't know DF. Alternatively, if E is not between them, but in some other position. However, since ED is given, and we need to relate EF somehow.

But maybe we can find EF in terms of ED. Wait, but without knowing DF's length, maybe not directly. Unless there's another relation.

Alternatively, since E is on DF, and F is on the circle. So maybe we can use coordinates again. Let me think.

Let me consider coordinates for point E and F. Since E is on DF, and F is on the circle. Let me attempt to model DF as a line. Let me suppose coordinates for D and F.

But since D is on the circle centered at L (origin) with radius 11, so coordinates of D satisfy x_D² + y_D² = 121. Same for F.

But E is on DF. Let me parametrize DF. Let me write parametric equations. Suppose D is (d_x, d_y) and F is (f_x, f_y). Then any point on DF can be written as D + t(F - D), where t is real number. So E is such a point. Let me denote E as E = D + t(F - D). Then, since EL is perpendicular to EF, which is the vector from E to F, i.e., (F - E). And EL is the vector from E to L, which is (L - E). These two vectors are perpendicular.

Thus, (L - E) • (F - E) = 0.

But L is the origin, so L - E = -E. So (-E) • (F - E) = 0 → -E • (F - E) = 0 → E • (F - E) = 0.

Expanding that: E • F - |E|² = 0 → E • F = |E|².

So the dot product of vectors E and F equals the magnitude squared of E. 

This seems like a useful equation. Also, since both D and F are points on the circle of radius 11 centered at L, so |D| = |F| = 11.

Additionally, since E is on DF, we can write E as a weighted average of D and F. Let me suppose that E divides DF in ratio k:1, but not sure. Alternatively, parametrize E as E = D + t(F - D). Then, substituting into E • F = |E|².

But this might get complicated. Perhaps there's another way. Let me see.

We also have that ED = 2x +14. Since E is on DF, then ED is the distance between E and D. If I can express ED in terms of parameters, maybe I can find relations.

But maybe instead of going too deep into coordinates, let's recall that earlier we had for the CLB triangle:

CL² + CB² = LB² → CL² + (9x)^2 = 11² → CL² = 121 - 81x².

Similarly, for the ELF triangle, EL² + EF² = 11² → EL² + EF² = 121.

But we need to relate EL and EF with other quantities. Maybe there's a connection between EL and CL, since L is on EC?

Because L is on EC, which means that points E, L, C are colinear. So CL is part of line EC. So CL is a segment from C to L, and EL is a segment from E to L. Since E and C are on the same line through L, then EL and CL are parts of that line. So if I consider points E, L, C on a straight line, then EL and CL are segments of that line, possibly with L between E and C or not.

Assuming L is between E and C, then EC = EL + LC. But if not, then EC = |EL - LC|. But without knowing the positions, it's ambiguous. However, since CL is perpendicular to CB, and we had earlier CL² = 121 - 81x². So CL is sqrt(121 - 81x²). But CL is a length, so 121 - 81x² ≥ 0 → x² ≤ 121/81 → x ≤ 11/9 ≈ 1.222. But the answer choices are integers from 1 to 4, so possible values x=1,2, etc. But if x=2, then 81*(4)= 324 > 121, making CL imaginary. Contradiction. Hence, x must be such that 81x² ≤ 121 → x² ≤ 121/81 ≈ 1.49. So x ≤ ~1.22. Hence, only possible integer value is x=1. But answer choices include 1,2,3,4. So maybe my assumption that L is between E and C is wrong?

Wait, maybe L is not between E and C. Suppose E and C are on opposite sides of L. Then EL and LC would be in opposite directions. So EC = EL + LC. But regardless, the length CL would still be related to EL. Wait, if L is not between E and C, then CL is the distance from C to L, which is same as LC. But EL is the distance from E to L. So if E and C are on opposite sides of L, then EC = EL + LC. So CL = LC, and EL is separate. But how does that help?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a relationship between EL and ED? Because ED is given as 2x +14, and in the previous case, for CL and CB, we have CL² = 121 - 81x². So maybe we can find EL in terms of ED?

But how?

Wait, going back to the earlier equation derived from the dot product: E • F = |E|². Also, since F is on the circle, |F| = 11. So F • F = 121. Also, E • F = |E|². Let me expand E • F:

E • F = (E_x * F_x + E_y * F_y) = |E|².

But since F is on the circle, F_x² + F_y² = 121.

Hmm, not sure yet. Let me think about the line DF containing E. So points D, E, F are colinear. So D, E, F are on the same line. Therefore, the vector from D to F is parallel to the vector from E to F or something. Wait, since E is on DF, then the vector DF is proportional to DE or something.

But perhaps using coordinates again. Let me assume coordinates for D and F. Let me suppose that D is (a, b) and F is (c, d), both satisfying a² + b² = 121 and c² + d² = 121. Then E is a point on DF. Let me parametrize E as E = D + t(F - D). So E_x = a + t(c - a), E_y = b + t(d - b).

Then, the condition E • F = |E|² becomes:

[E_x * F_x + E_y * F_y] = E_x² + E_y².

Substituting E_x and E_y:

[a + t(c - a)] * c + [b + t(d - b)] * d = [a + t(c - a)]² + [b + t(d - b)]².

Let me expand left side:

a*c + t(c - a)c + b*d + t(d - b)d = ac + bd + t[c(c - a) + d(d - b)]

Right side:

[a + t(c - a)]² + [b + t(d - b)]² = a² + 2at(c - a) + t²(c - a)^2 + b² + 2bt(d - b) + t²(d - b)^2.

So equating left and right:

ac + bd + t[c(c - a) + d(d - b)] = a² + b² + 2t[ a(c - a) + b(d - b) ] + t²[(c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2].

Bring all terms to left side:

ac + bd + t[c(c - a) + d(d - b)] - a² - b² - 2t[ a(c - a) + b(d - b) ] - t²[(c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2] = 0.

Let me simplify term by term.

First, ac + bd - a² - b² = -(a² - ac) - (b² - bd) = -a(a - c) - b(b - d). Not sure if helpful.

Next, the coefficient of t:

[c(c - a) + d(d - b)] - 2[ a(c - a) + b(d - b) ]

Let me compute:

First part: c(c - a) + d(d - b) = c² - ac + d² - bd.

Second part: 2[ a(c - a) + b(d - b) ] = 2[ ac - a² + bd - b² ].

So combining:

[c² - ac + d² - bd] - 2(ac - a² + bd - b² )

= c² - ac + d² - bd - 2ac + 2a² - 2bd + 2b²

= c² + d² - ac - bd - 2ac - 2bd + 2a² + 2b²

Wait, let me recheck:

Original expression after expanding:

[c² - ac + d² - bd] - 2ac + 2a² - 2bd + 2b² ?

No, sorry:

Wait, original expression is:

[c² - ac + d² - bd] minus 2 times [ac - a² + bd - b²]. So:

= c² - ac + d² - bd - 2ac + 2a² - 2bd + 2b² ?

Wait, no. Let me do it step by step.

The second part is subtracting 2*(ac - a² + bd - b²):

Which is -2ac + 2a² - 2bd + 2b².

Adding that to the first part:

c² - ac + d² - bd - 2ac + 2a² - 2bd + 2b².

Combine like terms:

c² + d² + 2a² + 2b² - ac - 2ac - bd - 2bd.

So:

c² + d² + 2a² + 2b² - 3ac - 3bd.

Hmm, messy. Not sure if helpful.

Then the quadratic term is -t²[(c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2].

But this seems too abstract. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, since D and F are points on the circle, and E is on DF, and E • F = |E|².

Let me consider that E is on DF. Let me denote vectorially, E = D + s(F - D), where s is a scalar. Then, since E • F = |E|².

Let me substitute E = D + s(F - D):

E • F = (D + s(F - D)) • F = D • F + s(F - D) • F = D • F + s(|F|² - D • F).

Set equal to |E|²:

D • F + s(|F|² - D • F) = |D + s(F - D)|².

Expand RHS:

|D|² + 2s D • (F - D) + s² |F - D|².

So,

Left side: D • F + s(|F|² - D • F)

Right side: |D|² + 2s(D • F - D • D) + s² |F - D|².

So setting left = right:

D • F + s(|F|² - D • F) = |D|² + 2s(D • F - |D|²) + s² |F - D|².

Rearranging terms:

Bring everything to left:

D • F + s(|F|² - D • F) - |D|² - 2s(D • F - |D|²) - s² |F - D|² = 0.

Group terms with s:

s[ |F|² - D • F - 2(D • F - |D|²) ] + D • F - |D|² - s² |F - D|² = 0.

Let me compute coefficients:

Coefficient of s:

|F|² - D • F - 2D • F + 2|D|² = |F|² - 3D • F + 2|D|².

Constant term (without s):

D • F - |D|².

So overall:

[ |F|² - 3D • F + 2|D|² ] s + (D • F - |D|²) - s² |F - D|² = 0.

This seems very complex. Maybe there's a specific property or relation I'm missing here.

Alternatively, since D and F are both on the circle of radius 11, so |D| = |F| = 11. Let me substitute that.

Let me replace |F|² with 121, and |D|² with 121.

So coefficient of s becomes:

121 - 3D • F + 2*121 = 121 + 242 - 3D • F = 363 - 3D • F.

Constant term: D • F - 121.

So equation becomes:

(363 - 3D • F)s + (D • F - 121) - s² |F - D|² = 0.

Still complicated. But maybe we can find D • F in terms of |F - D|²?

Yes! Because |F - D|² = |F|² + |D|² - 2D • F = 121 + 121 - 2D • F = 242 - 2D • F.

So |F - D|² = 242 - 2D • F.

Let me substitute that into the equation:

(363 - 3D • F)s + (D • F - 121) - s² (242 - 2D • F) = 0.

Let me rearrange:

-s²(242 - 2D • F) + s(363 - 3D • F) + (D • F - 121) = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in s. Solving for s would give us the value of parameter s, but this seems too involved. Maybe there's another approach.

Wait, but remember that ED = 2x +14. Since E is on DF, ED is the distance between E and D. Given that E = D + s(F - D), then the distance ED is |E - D| = |s(F - D)| = |s||F - D|. So ED = |s| * |F - D|.

Therefore, |s| = ED / |F - D|.

But also, since E is on DF, and assuming s is positive or negative depending on direction. But perhaps we can find |F - D|?

Wait, |F - D| is the distance between D and F. Since both are on the circle of radius 11, the maximum possible distance between D and F is 22 (when they're diametrically opposed), and minimum is 0. But without knowing their positions, it's hard to determine.

However, perhaps there's another relation. Recall that earlier, we had for the ELF triangle: EL² + EF² = 121.

But EF is the distance from E to F, which is |F - E|. And EL is the distance from E to L, which is |E|.

So EL² + EF² = |E|² + |F - E|² = 121.

But |F - E|² = |F|² + |E|² - 2E • F = 121 + |E|² - 2E • F.

So substituting into EL² + EF²:

|E|² + [121 + |E|² - 2E • F] = 121.

Simplify:

|E|² + 121 + |E|² - 2E • F = 121 → 2|E|² - 2E • F = 0 → |E|² = E • F.

Which matches our earlier conclusion that E • F = |E|².

So this gives us nothing new. It just confirms the condition we already had.

Maybe I need to connect this with ED. Since ED = |E - D| = |s| * |F - D|, and we have |E|² = E • F.

But how?

Let me try expressing E • F = |E|². Also, since D and F are on the circle, |D| = 11, |F| = 11. 

Let me consider expanding E • F:

E • F = (E_x * F_x + E_y * F_y) = |E|².

But also, since E is on DF, which connects D and F. So E can be expressed as a combination of D and F. Let me write E = D + t(F - D), as before. Then:

E = D + t(F - D) ⇒ E = (1 - t)D + tF.

So, E • F = [(1 - t)D + tF] • F = (1 - t)(D • F) + t|F|².

But we know this equals |E|².

So:

(1 - t)(D • F) + t * 121 = |E|².

But also, |E|² = |(1 - t)D + tF|² = (1 - t)^2 |D|² + 2t(1 - t) D • F + t² |F|².

Substitute |D|² = |F|² = 121:

|E|² = (1 - t)^2 * 121 + 2t(1 - t) D • F + t² * 121.

So:

(1 - t)^2 * 121 + 2t(1 - t) D • F + t² * 121 = (1 - t)(D • F) + t * 121.

Let me expand the left side:

First term: (1 - 2t + t²) * 121.

Second term: 2t(1 - t) D • F.

Third term: t² * 121.

Combined:

Left side = 121(1 - 2t + t²) + 2t(1 - t) D • F + 121t² = 121(1 - 2t + t² + t²) + 2t(1 - t) D • F = 121(1 - 2t + 2t²) + 2t(1 - t) D • F.

Right side: (1 - t)(D • F) + 121t.

So setting left = right:

121(1 - 2t + 2t²) + 2t(1 - t) D • F = (1 - t)(D • F) + 121t.

Let me bring all terms to left side:

121(1 - 2t + 2t²) + 2t(1 - t) D • F - (1 - t)(D • F) - 121t = 0.

Factor terms:

For the D • F terms:

[2t(1 - t) - (1 - t)] D • F = (1 - t)(2t - 1) D • F.

For the constants:

121(1 - 2t + 2t²) - 121t = 121[1 - 2t + 2t² - t] = 121[1 - 3t + 2t²].

So overall:

(1 - t)(2t - 1) D • F + 121(1 - 3t + 2t²) = 0.

This seems complicated, but maybe we can find D • F in terms of |F - D|², which we did earlier.

Recall that |F - D|² = 242 - 2D • F, so D • F = (242 - |F - D|²)/2.

But we don't know |F - D|². However, if we could find |F - D| in terms of ED or something else...

Wait, ED = |E - D| = |s| * |F - D|. Earlier, we said that E = (1 - t)D + tF, so s = t? Wait, earlier I used s as the parameter for E = D + s(F - D). Now, in this case, E = (1 - t)D + tF, which implies s = t. So yes, ED = |s| * |F - D|.

But we also have ED = 2x +14. So |s| * |F - D| = 2x +14.

But this introduces another variable, |F - D|, which we don't know. This seems stuck.

Perhaps there's another relation I haven't considered yet. Let me revisit the problem statement.

We also know that AB is congruent to DF. So AB = DF. But AB is a segment from A to B, both on the circle. DF is the segment from D to F, which is on the circle. So AB and DF are chords of the circle.

But AB = DF. So the lengths of chords AB and DF are equal. Since they are chords of the same circle, their lengths depend on their distance from the center.

But since A and B are points on the circle, and D and F are points on the circle, AB = DF implies that either AB and DF are congruent chords, hence their corresponding central angles are equal, or they are the same chord.

But how does this help us?

Well, if AB = DF, then the length of AB is equal to DF. Let me calculate AB. Since A and B are on the circle of radius 11, the length of AB can be calculated using the chord length formula: 2r sin(theta/2), where theta is the central angle between A and B.

Similarly for DF: 2r sin(phi/2), where phi is the central angle between D and F. Since AB = DF, then 2r sin(theta/2) = 2r sin(phi/2) → sin(theta/2) = sin(phi/2). So either theta = phi or theta = π - phi.

But without knowing the specific positions, it's hard to proceed. However, since AB and DF are both chords, their lengths are determined by their respective central angles. But how does this tie into the rest of the problem?

Alternatively, since AB = DF, and we might be able to find expressions for AB and DF in terms of x.

But how?

Wait, AB is a chord, but we don't have direct information about it except that it's congruent to DF. But DF is a segment whose length we might relate to ED.

Earlier, ED is given as 2x +14, and E is on DF. So if we could express DF in terms of ED, that might help. But DF = DE + EF or DF = |DE - EF| depending on E's position.

But if we assume that E is between D and F, then DF = DE + EF. Hence, EF = DF - DE. But we don't know DF. However, since DF is a chord of the circle, its length is 2*sqrt(r² - d²), where d is the distance from the center to the chord. But without knowing d, we can't find DF directly.

Alternatively, since DF is a chord, and E is on DF, and EL is perpendicular to EF, which gave us the condition E • F = |E|². Maybe combining this with other relations?

Alternatively, let me return to the earlier equations involving CL and EL.

From CLB triangle: CL² + (9x)^2 = 121 → CL² = 121 - 81x².

From ELF triangle: EL² + EF² = 121.

But if I can relate CL and EL, since L is on EC, and E is on DF.

Wait, since E and C are on line EC, passing through L. So EL is a segment from E to L, and CL is from C to L. So if I consider the line EC, then EL and CL are parts of it. Let me assume that L is between E and C. Then, EC = EL + CL.

But if that's the case, then EL = EC - CL.

But I don't know EC. However, maybe there's a relation between EC and other segments?

Alternatively, since CL is perpendicular to CB, and CB is a segment from C to B. But B is on the circle. So CB is a segment from C to B, and CL is perpendicular to it.

But I don't see a direct relation yet.

Let me think differently. Since AB = DF, and both are chords of the circle. So AB = DF. Let me denote AB = DF = y.

But AB is a chord from A to B, and DF is a chord from D to F. Both are chords of the circle with radius 11.

But how to relate this to x?

Alternatively, since we have multiple points on the circle: A, B, D, F. Maybe there are symmetries or relationships between them?

But without knowing their positions, it's hard to say.

Wait, but we also have the perpendicularity conditions. For instance, CL ⊥ CB and EL ⊥ EF. Maybe these perpendicularities imply certain positions of points?

For example, CL ⊥ CB implies that CB is tangent to some circle? No, because CL is perpendicular to CB, and L is on EC. So if you imagine point C, with line CB, and line CL perpendicular to it, then L lies on the line EC, and CL is perpendicular to CB. So this suggests that CL is the altitude from C to line CB? No, since CB is itself a line, and CL is perpendicular to it. Wait, but CL is a segment from C to L, which is perpendicular to CB. So this implies that L lies on the line perpendicular to CB at point C? No, because CL is perpendicular to CB, but L is on line EC. So unless line EC is perpendicular to CB at C, which would mean that EC is perpendicular to CB at C. But that's only if L is at the foot of the perpendicular from C to CB, but L is on EC. So this suggests that line EC is the line perpendicular to CB at C, and L is somewhere on that line. Wait, if CL is perpendicular to CB, then line CL is perpendicular to CB. So if you have point C, and line CB, then line CL is perpendicular to CB, so line CL is the line through C perpendicular to CB. So L lies on this line. But also, L is on line EC. So line EC is the line through C and L, which is perpendicular to CB. So line EC is perpendicular to CB at point C? Wait, no, because L is a point on line EC, but it's not necessarily at C. So line EC is the line through C and L, which is perpendicular to CB. So the line EC is perpendicular to CB at C? Only if L is at C, but that would make CL zero length. So no, unless L is at C, which would make CL zero, but CL² = 121 - 81x². So unless x is imaginary, which it can't be. Hence, L is not at C.

This suggests that line EC is perpendicular to CB, but passes through C and L. So line EC is perpendicular to CB, and L is on that line. So from point C, draw a line perpendicular to CB, and L is somewhere on that line.

Similarly, line EL is perpendicular to EF. So from point E, draw a line perpendicular to EF, and L is on that line.

But since L is the center of the circle, and points B, D, A, F are on the circle, maybe there are some relations here.

Wait, if line CL is perpendicular to CB, and L is the center of the circle. Let me think about the circle. If CB is a chord of the circle, then the perpendicular from the center to the chord passes through the midpoint of the chord. Wait, but here, CL is perpendicular to CB, but L is the center. So if L is the center, then CL is the perpendicular from the center to the chord CB. Which would mean that L lies on the perpendicular bisector of CB. But since L is the center, this is always true. Wait, no. The perpendicular from the center to a chord passes through the midpoint of the chord. So if CL is perpendicular to CB, then L lies on the perpendicular bisector of CB. So the midpoint of CB is on line CL.

But since L is the center of the circle, and B is on the circle, then the line from L to B is a radius. So the midpoint of CB is somewhere on line CL, which is the perpendicular from L to CB.

Wait, this is getting complex. Let me try to think step by step.

Since CL is perpendicular to CB, and L is the center of the circle. Let me consider CB as a chord of the circle. The perpendicular from the center to the chord CB passes through the midpoint of CB. So the midpoint of CB is on line CL.

Let me denote M as the midpoint of CB. Then LM is perpendicular to CB, and L is the center. So LM is the perpendicular from center to chord CB, which means that M is the midpoint of CB.

But also, since CL is perpendicular to CB, then line CL is the same as line LM. So L, M, and C are colinear, with M being the midpoint of CB. Wait, no. If CL is perpendicular to CB, then line CL is the same as the perpendicular from L to CB, which passes through M, the midpoint. So if L is on that line, then CL is part of that line. So point C, L, and M are colinear, with M being the midpoint of CB.

But since L is the center, and M is the midpoint of CB, then LM is the distance from the center to the chord CB. The length of LM can be calculated using the formula: LM = √(r² - (CB/2)^2), where r is the radius of the circle.

Wait, let me recall that for a chord of length l, the distance from the center to the chord is d = √(r² - (l/2)^2).

In this case, CB is a chord of the circle, with length 9x. So the distance from the center L to chord CB is d = √(11² - (9x/2)^2). But this distance is also equal to LM, where M is the midpoint of CB.

But since CL is perpendicular to CB, and M is the midpoint, then LM is the distance from L to CB, and CL is the segment from C to L. But how is CL related to LM?

Let me think about triangle CLM. Since M is the midpoint of CB, CM = CB/2 = (9x)/2. And LM is the distance from L to CB, which is √(121 - (81x²)/4).

Also, since L, M, and C are colinear, with M between C and L or L between C and M?

Wait, depending on the position. If the center L is inside the circle, and CB is a chord, then the distance from L to CB is LM, and CL is from C to L. So if we consider triangle CLM, with CM = 9x/2, LM = √(121 - (81x²)/4), and CL is the length from C to L.

Using Pythagoras, since LM is the distance from L to CB, and CM is half of CB, then in triangle CLM, which is a right triangle at M, we have:

CL² = CM² + LM².

So:

CL² = (9x/2)^2 + [√(121 - (81x²)/4)]² = (81x²)/4 + 121 - (81x²)/4 = 121.

Wait, this implies CL² = 121, so CL = 11. But earlier, from the right triangle CLB, we had CL² + CB² = LB². Wait, but LB is the radius, which is 11. So:

CL² + CB² = 11² → CL² + (9x)^2 = 121 → CL² = 121 - 81x².

But according to this new calculation, CL² = 121. So combining these:

121 - 81x² = 121 → 81x² = 0 → x = 0. Which is impossible, as x is positive.

Contradiction! What went wrong here?

Ah, here's the mistake. I assumed that triangle CLM is a right triangle, but actually, LM is the distance from L to CB, and CL is from C to L. However, M is the midpoint of CB, so CM is half of CB, but LM is perpendicular to CB, and CL is from C to L. So triangle CLM is not necessarily a right triangle unless L is aligned in a specific way.

Wait, no. Since LM is perpendicular to CB, and M is the midpoint of CB, and L is the center. So the line LM is the perpendicular from L to CB, passing through M. But CL is a line from C to L. So unless L is on the line CM, which it is, since M is the midpoint of CB and L is on the perpendicular to CB through M. So the line CL passes through M? No, unless L is on line CM. Wait, no. The line LM is the perpendicular from L to CB, passing through M. So L is on the line LM, which is perpendicular to CB. But line CM is part of CB. So lines LM and CM are perpendicular. So point C, M, and L form a right angle at M.

Wait, this means that triangle CLM is a right triangle at M. So CL² = CM² + LM².

But LM is the distance from L to CB, which is √(r² - (CB/2)^2) = √(121 - (81x²)/4).

And CM is CB/2 = (9x)/2.

So CL² = (81x²)/4 + 121 - (81x²)/4 = 121 → CL = 11.

But from the earlier triangle CLB, we had CL² + CB² = LB² → CL² + 81x² = 121 → CL² = 121 - 81x².

But according to this, CL² = 121, so 121 - 81x² = 121 → x = 0. Contradiction!

This suggests a contradiction, which means my assumptions are wrong.

Where is the error? Let me check.

I assumed that CL is perpendicular to CB, and that LM is the perpendicular from L to CB. But in reality, CL is perpendicular to CB, which means that CL is the line from C to L, which is perpendicular to CB. But LM is the perpendicular from L to CB, which is the same as CL, since L is on that perpendicular. Wait, if CL is perpendicular to CB, then CL is the same as the perpendicular from L to CB. So the line CL is the perpendicular from L to CB. But since M is the midpoint of CB, this line passes through M. So CL passes through M. So point M lies on CL.

Thus, the length CL is the distance from C to L, and M is between C and L or L and C?

If L is the center of the circle, and CB is a chord, then the perpendicular from L to CB passes through M, the midpoint of CB. So line CL is this perpendicular line, passing through M. So C, M, L are colinear, with M between C and L or L between C and M?

Depends on the position. If the center L is on the same side of CB as C, then M is between C and L. Or if it's on the opposite side, then L is between C and M.

But in any case, CL is the length from C to L, and CM is half of CB. So using Pythagoras, CL² = CM² + LM².

But LM is the distance from L to CB, which is √(r² - (CB/2)^2) = √(121 - (81x²)/4).

But also, since CL is the hypotenuse of triangle CLM, CL² = CM² + LM².

So:

CL² = (9x/2)^2 + [√(121 - (81x²)/4)]^2 = (81x²)/4 + 121 - (81x²)/4 = 121.

So CL² = 121, which implies CL = 11.

But from the earlier triangle CLB, we had CL² + CB² = LB² → CL² + (9x)^2 = 121 → 121 + 81x² = 121 → 81x² = 0 → x = 0. Contradiction!

This suggests that there's a fundamental inconsistency, implying that my initial assumptions are incorrect. Where is the mistake?

Wait, the error is in the assumption that triangle CLB is right-angled at L. Let me double-check the original problem.

The problem says: Perpendicular(Line(C, L), Line(C, B)). So line CL is perpendicular to line CB. So the angle at C between CL and CB is 90 degrees? Or is it the angle at L?

Wait, Perpendicular(Line(C, L), Line(C, B)) means that the lines CL and CB are perpendicular. So the angle between CL and CB is 90 degrees. So at point C, the lines CL and CB meet at a right angle. So the right angle is at C, not at L.

Wait, this changes things! Earlier, I thought it was a right angle at L, but it's actually at C. So the right angle is at C, between CL and CB. So the triangle is not CLB right-angled at L, but at C.

That explains the contradiction! I misread the perpendicular condition. Let me correct that.

So, if the lines CL and CB are perpendicular, then at point C, the lines CL and CB form a right angle. So triangle CLB has a right angle at C, not at L.

So in this case, applying Pythagoras to triangle CLB: CL² + CB² = LB².

Wait, no. In a right triangle, the sum of squares of the legs equals the square of the hypotenuse. If the right angle is at C, then the legs are CL and CB, and the hypotenuse is LB.

Wait, no. Let me clarify:

If the right angle is at C, then the two legs are CL and CB, and the hypotenuse is LB.

Wait, no. Let me think: points C, L, B. The right angle is at C, so the sides forming the right angle are CL and CB. So the hypotenuse is LB. So:

CL² + CB² = LB².

Which is what I originally had, leading to CL² = 121 - 81x².

But earlier, when I tried using the perpendicular from center to chord, I got CL² = 121, leading to contradiction. But now, with the right angle at C, let's redo that analysis.

Since the right angle is at C, and CB is a chord of the circle, with L being the center. Let me consider triangle CLB, right-angled at C.

So CL is one leg, CB is another leg, and LB is the hypotenuse.

But L is the center of the circle, and B is on the circle, so LB = 11.

So CL² + CB² = 11² → CL² + (9x)^2 = 121 → CL² = 121 - 81x².

Now, let's go back to the earlier analysis about the perpendicular from L to CB. Since CB is a chord, the perpendicular from L to CB passes through the midpoint M of CB. But in this case, since CL is perpendicular to CB at C, this implies that CL is the same as the perpendicular from C to CB? No, because CL is a line from C to L, which is perpendicular to CB. So this means that L lies on the line that is perpendicular to CB at C. So line CL is the line through C and L, which is perpendicular to CB. This means that L is on the line perpendicular to CB at C. Hence, the line CL is the perpendicular to CB at C, so it passes through C and extends to L.

But L is the center of the circle, and B is on the circle. So the line CL is the line through C, perpendicular to CB, extending to the center L.

Now, let's consider the length CL. From the right triangle CLB, we have CL² = 121 - 81x².

Also, since L is the center, and B is on the circle, the distance from L to B is 11. So LB = 11.

Now, let's consider the position of L relative to CB. Since CL is perpendicular to CB at C, and L is on that line, then L is located along the line perpendicular to CB at C. Let me imagine this: point C, line CB, and line CL perpendicular to CB at C, extending to L. So L is somewhere along this perpendicular line.

Now, let me consider the distance from L to B. Since B is on the circle, and L is the center, LB = 11. But also, from point C, we have CB = 9x, and CL is some length.

Let me apply the Pythagorean theorem in triangle CLB, which is right-angled at C: CL² + CB² = LB² → CL² + (9x)^2 = 121 → CL = √(121 - 81x²).

Now, let me think about the position of L. Since L is on the line perpendicular to CB at C, we can express the coordinates of L in terms of C and B.

Let me place point C at the origin for simplicity. Let me set up coordinates: let C be at (0, 0). Since CL is perpendicular to CB, let me align CB along the x-axis. So point B is at (9x, 0), since CB has length 9x. Then, line CL is perpendicular to CB, so it is along the y-axis. So point L is somewhere along the y-axis. Let me denote L as (0, k), where k is some real number.

Now, since B is at (9x, 0), and L is at (0, k), the distance LB is the distance between (9x, 0) and (0, k), which is √[(9x)^2 + k²] = 11. So:

(9x)^2 + k² = 121 → 81x² + k² = 121 → k² = 121 - 81x².

Which matches our earlier result for CL² = k² = 121 - 81x². So this checks out.

Now, what about other points? Let me recall that L is the center of the circle, and points B, D, A, F are on the circle. So the center L is at (0, k), and B is at (9x, 0). So the circle has center (0, k) and radius 11. So the equation of the circle is (x - 0)^2 + (y - k)^2 = 121.

Point B is on this circle: (9x)^2 + (0 - k)^2 = 121 → 81x² + k² = 121, which is consistent.

Now, let's consider other points. For example, point D is also on the circle. Also, ED = 2x +14, and EL is perpendicular to EF.

Let me try to work with this coordinate system. Let me keep C at (0, 0), B at (9x, 0), L at (0, k), where k² = 121 - 81x².

Now, we need to consider point E and F, with EL perpendicular to EF, and E on DF, and D on the circle.

Let me try to find coordinates for E and F. Let me think about line DF, which contains point E. Also, point E is on line DF, and EL is perpendicular to EF.

Let me assume coordinates for D and F. Since D is on the circle, it satisfies x_D² + (y_D - k)^2 = 121.

Similarly for F.

But this seems complex. Let me focus on the condition EL ⊥ EF.

Since L is at (0, k), and E is some point. Let me denote E as (e_x, e_y). Then vector EL is from E to L: (0 - e_x, k - e_y) = (-e_x, k - e_y). Vector EF is from E to F: (f_x - e_x, f_y - e_y). These vectors are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero:

(-e_x)(f_x - e_x) + (k - e_y)(f_y - e_y) = 0.

Expanding:

-e_x f_x + e_x² + (k - e_y)f_y - (k - e_y)e_y = 0.

This is one equation, but without knowing coordinates of F, it's difficult to proceed.

But we also know that E is on line DF. Let me parametrize line DF. Let me assume D is (d_x, d_y) and F is (f_x, f_y), both on the circle. E is on DF, so E = D + t(F - D) for some t.

But this might not be helpful without knowing D and F.

Alternatively, since ED = 2x +14, and E is on DF, perhaps we can relate ED to other quantities.

But I'm stuck here. Let me try to find another relation.

We also know that AB = DF. AB is a chord from A to B, and DF is a chord from D to F. Both are chords of the circle with center L.

Let me calculate AB. Since A is on the circle, and B is at (9x, 0). Let me assume A is another point on the circle. But without knowing A's position, it's hard to calculate AB.

But since AB = DF, and DF is a chord, we might relate their lengths.

But how?

Alternatively, since AB = DF, and both are chords of the circle, their lengths are determined by their distances from the center. Let me denote the distance from center L to AB as d_AB and to DF as d_DF. Then:

AB = 2√(r² - d_AB²)  
DF = 2√(r² - d_DF²)

Since AB = DF, then √(r² - d_AB²) = √(r² - d_DF²) → d_AB = d_DF.

So the distance from L to AB is equal to the distance from L to DF.

But what is the distance from L to AB? Since AB is a chord, and L is the center.

But AB is a chord from A to B. Since B is at (9x, 0), and A is another point on the circle. The distance from L to AB depends on the position of A.

But this seems too vague. Let me think if there's another way.

Let me recall that we have two expressions involving x: one from CL² = 121 - 81x², and another from the EL and EF condition.

But I need to find another equation relating x. Let me think about the EL and EF condition.

From earlier, we had for the right triangle ELF: EL² + EF² = 121.

But EL is the distance from E to L, and EF is the distance from E to F.

But how to relate these to ED = 2x +14?

Since E is on DF, and ED = 2x +14, let me assume that E is between D and F. Then DF = DE + EF → EF = DF - DE = DF - (2x +14).

But DF is the length of the chord from D to F, which is 2√(r² - d_DF²), where d_DF is the distance from L to DF.

But without knowing d_DF, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, since E is on DF, and EL is perpendicular to EF, maybe we can use the earlier condition E • F = |E|².

Wait, earlier, we derived that for E on DF, E • F = |E|². Let me try to use this.

Given that, and knowing that F is on the circle, |F|² = 121, but wait, |F| is the distance from F to L, which is the radius, so |F|² = 121. But E is a point in the plane, so |E|² is the square of its distance from L.

So E • F = |E|².

But also, since E is on DF, and D is on the circle, let me consider the vector equation.

Let me denote vector OD = D, OF = F, OE = E. Since D and F are on the circle, |OD| = |OF| = 11.

But E is on DF, so E = D + t(F - D), for some t.

Then, E • F = |E|².

Substituting E = D + t(F - D):

(D + t(F - D)) • F = |D + t(F - D)|².

Expanding:

D • F + t(F - D) • F = |D|² + 2t D • (F - D) + t² |F - D|².

As before.

But since |D|² = |F|² = 121, and |F - D|² = 242 - 2D • F.

Let me rewrite the equation:

D • F + t(|F|² - D • F) = 121 + 2t(D • F - |D|²) + t²(242 - 2D • F).

Substituting |F|² = 121 and |D|² = 121:

D • F + t(121 - D • F) = 121 + 2t(D • F - 121) + t²(242 - 2D • F).

Let me move all terms to left:

D • F + t(121 - D • F) - 121 - 2t(D • F - 121) - t²(242 - 2D • F) = 0.

Expand terms:

D • F - 121 + t(121 - D • F) - 2t(D • F - 121) - t²(242 - 2D • F) = 0.

Notice that 121 - D • F = -(D • F - 121), so:

D • F - 121 + t(121 - D • F) + 2t(121 - D • F) - t²(242 - 2D • F) = 0.

Combine like terms:

[D • F - 121] + 3t(121 - D • F) - t²(242 - 2D • F) = 0.

Let me factor out (121 - D • F):

Let me set u = D • F.

Then the equation becomes:

(u - 121) + 3t(121 - u) - t²(242 - 2u) = 0.

Let me factor out (121 - u):

Note that (u - 121) = -(121 - u), so:

-(121 - u) + 3t(121 - u) - t²(242 - 2u) = 0.

Factor (121 - u):

(121 - u)(-1 + 3t) - t²(242 - 2u) = 0.

This is still complex, but perhaps if we can find u in terms of other variables.

But I'm stuck here. Let me try to find another approach.

Let me recall that ED = 2x +14, and E is on DF. Also, from the condition E • F = |E|², and F is on the circle.

Let me consider the special case where E is the midpoint of DF. If E is the midpoint, then ED = DF/2, so DF = 2ED = 2(2x +14) = 4x +28. But since DF is a chord of the circle, its length is 2√(121 - d²), where d is the distance from L to DF. But without knowing d, this might not help.

Alternatively, if E is the midpoint, then from the condition E • F = |E|², let me see.

If E is the midpoint of DF, then E = (D + F)/2. So let's substitute this into E • F = |E|²:

(D + F)/2 • F = |(D + F)/2|².

Left side: (D • F + |F|²)/2 = (D • F + 121)/2.

Right side: |D + F|² / 4 = (|D|² + 2D • F + |F|²)/4 = (121 + 2D • F + 121)/4 = (242 + 2D • F)/4 = (121 + D • F)/2.

So both sides are equal. Hence, the condition holds for any D and F where E is the midpoint. So this suggests that if E is the midpoint of DF, then the condition E • F = |E|² is satisfied.

But this is just one possibility. It could be that E is the midpoint, but it could also be other positions.

But if we assume that E is the midpoint, then ED = DF/2 = 2x +14 → DF = 4x +28.

But DF is a chord of the circle, so its length is 2√(121 - d²), where d is the distance from L to DF.

But without knowing d, it's hard to proceed. However, if we can relate this to other parts.

But we also have the condition from the EL and EF triangle: EL² + EF² = 121. If E is the midpoint of DF, then EF = DF/2 = 2x +14, and EL is the distance from E to L.

But since E is the midpoint of DF, and L is the center of the circle, the distance from E to L is the distance from the midpoint of DF to the center. Let me denote this as d_E.

Then, EL = d_E, and EF = DF/2 = 2x +14.

So EL² + EF² = d_E² + (2x +14)^2 = 121.

But what is d_E? It is the distance from the midpoint of DF to the center L.

But since DF is a chord of the circle, the distance from the center to the chord is d_chord = √(121 - (DF/2)^2). But the distance from the center to the midpoint of DF is d_chord. But if E is the midpoint of DF, then EL is this distance d_chord.

Wait, no. If E is the midpoint of DF, then the line LE is the line from the center to the midpoint of DF, which is perpendicular to DF. Hence, EL is the distance from L to DF, which is d_chord = √(121 - (DF/2)^2).

So in this case, EL = d_chord = √(121 - (DF/2)^2).

So plugging into the equation EL² + EF² = 121:

[121 - (DF/2)^2] + (DF/2)^2 = 121 → 121 = 121. Which is always true.

So this condition is automatically satisfied if E is the midpoint of DF. Hence, the condition EL ⊥ EF is satisfied if E is the midpoint of DF.

This suggests that E is the midpoint of DF. Hence, ED = DF/2 = 2x +14 → DF = 4x +28.

But DF is a chord of the circle, so its length is 4x +28 = 2√(121 - d_chord²), where d_chord is the distance from L to DF. But since d_chord = √(121 - (DF/2)^2), this is consistent.

But how does this help us find x?

We need another equation to relate x. Let me recall that we have the CL condition from before: CL² = 121 - 81x².

But CL is the distance from C to L. In our coordinate system, where C is at (0, 0) and L is at (0, k), then CL is the distance from (0,0) to (0, k), which is |k| = √(121 - 81x²).

But also, since L is the center of the circle, and B is on the circle, and in our coordinate system, B is at (9x, 0). The distance from L to B is 11, which we've already used.

Now, what about point D? D is on the circle, so its coordinates satisfy x_D² + (y_D - k)^2 = 121.

But I need to relate this to DF =
