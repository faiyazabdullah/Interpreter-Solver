MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So we have an equilateral pentagon PQRST inscribed in a circle with center U and radius 5.0. We need to find the measure of arc QR, denoted as mâˆ QR. The answer choices are A through D, each representing different degree measures.

First, since it's an equilateral pentagon, that means all sides are equal. But wait, in a regular pentagon, all sides and angles are equal, but here it just says equilateral. Hmm, so maybe it's not necessarily regular? Wait, but if it's inscribed in a circle, then maybe there's some relation between the sides and arcs?

Wait, hold on. In a cyclic polygon (a polygon inscribed in a circle), if all sides are equal, does that mean it's regular? Or can it still be irregular? Let me think. For example, in a cyclic quadrilateral, if all sides are equal, it's a square, which is regular. But for pentagons, I'm not sure. Maybe there's more flexibility? But perhaps in this case, since it's equilateral and cyclic, there might be certain properties we can use.

But the question is about the measure of arc QR. Since the pentagon is inscribed in the circle, each vertex lies on the circumference. The central angle corresponding to arc QR would be twice the inscribed angle subtended by the same arc. Wait, but we don't know any angles here. However, since the pentagon is equilateral, maybe the arcs correspond to equal lengths?

Wait, no. If the sides are equal, but since the chords (sides) are equal, their corresponding arcs should be equal because in a circle, equal chords subtend equal arcs. Therefore, each side of the pentagon corresponds to an arc of equal measure. 

So, since the pentagon has five equal sides, each arc between consecutive vertices would be equal. Therefore, the total circumference of the circle is divided into five equal arcs. Wait, but the sum of all arcs in a circle is 360 degrees. So each arc would be 360/5 = 72 degrees. Therefore, each arc between two consecutive points is 72 degrees. So arc PQ, QR, RS, ST, and TP each measure 72 degrees. Then, the measure of arc QR would be 72 degrees. That would make answer B.

Wait, but hold on. Is the pentagon convex? Well, since it's inscribed in a circle, it must be convex. Also, if all sides are equal, then yes, each arc between consecutive vertices would be equal. Therefore, each arc is 72 degrees. Hence, arc QR is 72 degrees. So the answer would be B.

But wait, let me check again. Suppose the pentagon is equilateral, meaning all sides are congruent. In a circle, congruent chords correspond to congruent arcs. Therefore, each side corresponds to an arc of equal measure. Thus, the entire circle is divided into five equal arcs. Therefore, each arc is 360/5=72 degrees. Therefore, arc QR is 72 degrees. So answer B.

Alternatively, could there be another interpretation? For instance, maybe the pentagon isn't regular, but just equilateral. But even then, if all sides are equal and it's cyclic, then the arcs must be equal. Because chord length depends only on the central angle. So if all chords are equal, their central angles are equal. Therefore, the arcs must be equal. Therefore, regardless of the specific angles of the pentagon, the arcs between the vertices would be equal. Therefore, each arc is 72 degrees. Therefore, arc QR is 72 degrees. So answer B.

Therefore, the correct answer should be B. 72 degrees.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of arc $ \widehat{QR} $ in the given configuration, we begin by analyzing the geometric constraints:

- Points $ P, Q, R, S, T $ lie on the circle centered at point $ U $ with radius $ 5.0 $.  
- The pentagon $ PQRST $ is **equilateral**, meaning all its sides are of equal length.  
- The pentagon is **inscribed** in the circle, making it a **cyclic pentagon**.

---

### Step 1: Understanding the Implication of Equal Side Lengths in a Cyclic Polygon

In a **cyclic polygon**, the **length of a chord** is determined entirely by the **central angle** subtending it. Specifically, for two points on a circle separated by a chord of length $ l $, the central angle $ \theta $ satisfies:

$$
l = 2r \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
$$

Since the pentagon is **equilateral**, all its sides are equal in length. This implies that the **corresponding central angles** for each side must also be equal. Therefore, the circle is divided into **five equal arcs** by the vertices of the pentagon.

---

### Step 2: Calculating the Central Angle per Arc

The full circle contains $ 360^\circ $, and since the pentagon divides the circle into 5 equal arcs:

$$
\text{Measure of each arc} = \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
$$

Thus, the arc $ \widehat{QR} $, which spans from point $ Q $ to point $ R $, corresponds to one of these equal arcs.

---

### Final Conclusion

Each arc formed by consecutive vertices of the equilateral cyclic pentagon measures $ 72^\circ $. Therefore, the measure of arc $ \widehat{QR} $ is:

$$
\boxed{72}
$$
