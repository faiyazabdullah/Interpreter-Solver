MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, C, D, E, F, G involved here. The question says that chords AC and DF are equidistant from the center. The radius of circle G is 26, and we need to find the length of AC. The answer choices are A. 5, B. 10, C. 13, D. 48. 

First, I need to recall some geometry concepts. Since AC and DF are chords of the same circle (since they're both related to circle G), and they're equidistant from the center. There's a theorem that states that if two chords are equidistant from the center, then their lengths are equal. Wait, but maybe it's the other way around? Or does it mean that if they are equidistant, then they are congruent? Let me think. Yes, I remember that in a circle, two chords equidistant from the center are congruent. So if AC and DF are equidistant from the center, then their lengths should be equal. But wait, the problem states that AC and DF are equidistant from the center, so their lengths would be equal. However, the problem also gives us some specific information about points lying on lines and circles. Maybe there's more to it?

Wait, looking back at the constraints:

- Length of BG and EG is 10. So points B and E are each 10 units away from point G. Also, points D, A, F, C lie on the circle centered at G with radius 2.0? Wait, no. Let me check again.

The PointLiesOnCircle statements:

- D lies on Circle(G, radius_2_0)
- A lies on Circle(G, radius_2_0)
- F lies on Circle(G, radius_2_0)
- C lies on Circle(G, radius_0_2?) Wait, the original says:

Original constraints:

PointLiesOnCircle(D, Circle(G, radius_2_0)) → D is on a circle centered at G with radius 2.0

Similarly for A, F, C. So points A, C, D, F are on a circle with radius 2.0 centered at G. Wait, but then those points are on a smaller circle inside the larger circle with radius 26. Because the radius of circle G is 26. Wait, hold on. Wait, the problem says "the radius of ⊙G is 26". But the constraints mention points lying on Circle(G, radius_2_0). That seems conflicting unless there's a typo. Wait, perhaps the radius_2_0 is 2.0? So the small circle has radius 2.0, while the main circle (⊙G) has radius 26. 

So points A, C, D, F are on a circle with radius 2.0, which is inside the larger circle with radius 26. Then, chords AC and DF are chords of the large circle? Or are they chords of the small circle? Wait, the chords AC and DF—since points A and C are on the small circle, then chord AC would be a chord of the small circle. Similarly for DF. But the problem says that these chords are equidistant from the center. Wait, but the center of the circle is G. So if AC and DF are chords of the small circle, then their distances from the center G would be... Hmm, but how can chords of the small circle be equidistant from the center of the larger circle? Wait, maybe there's confusion here.

Alternatively, maybe the chords AC and DF are chords of the larger circle (with radius 26), but points A, C, D, F are on the small circle. Wait, but if points A and C are on the small circle, then chord AC is part of the small circle. Therefore, its distance from the center G would depend on the position. Alternatively, maybe the chords AC and DF are chords of the larger circle, but points A, C, D, F are on the small circle. That might make sense. For example, points A and C are endpoints of a chord of the larger circle, but they also lie on a smaller circle. 

But the problem statement mentions "Chords AC and DF are equidistant from the center." So the center is G. So the distance from the center G to the chord AC is equal to the distance from G to chord DF. 

Let me re-examine the given data. 

Given:

- Points D, A, F, C lie on Circle(G, radius_2_0). So they are all on a circle with radius 2.0 centered at G. Therefore, GA = GC = GD = GF = 2.0. 

But then, chords AC and DF are chords of the larger circle (radius 26)? Wait, no. If points A and C are on the small circle (radius 2.0), then chord AC is a chord of the small circle. But the problem refers to chords AC and DF being equidistant from the center. So if the center is G, then the distance from G to chord AC is equal to the distance from G to chord DF. 

However, since points A and C lie on a circle of radius 2.0 centered at G, then the maximum possible distance between two points on that circle is the diameter, which is 4.0. Therefore, chord AC is a chord of the small circle. The distance from the center G to chord AC can be calculated using the formula: distance d = sqrt(r² - (l/2)²), where l is the length of the chord. Wait, no—the formula is that for a chord of length l in a circle of radius r, the distance from the center to the chord is d = sqrt(r² - (l/2)^2). Wait, actually, the formula is derived as follows: if you have a chord of length l, then half the chord is l/2, and the distance from the center forms a right triangle with half the chord and the radius. So yes, d = sqrt(r² - (l/2)^2). 

But in our case, since the chord AC is part of the small circle (radius 2.0), then if we denote the distance from G to chord AC as d_AC, then:

d_AC = sqrt((2.0)^2 - (AC/2)^2)

Similarly for chord DF, since points D and F are also on the same small circle (radius 2.0), the distance from G to DF is:

d_DF = sqrt((2.0)^2 - (DF/2)^2)

Since the problem states that chords AC and DF are equidistant from the center, meaning d_AC = d_DF. Therefore,

sqrt(4 - (AC/2)^2 ) = sqrt(4 - (DF/2)^2 )

Which implies that AC = DF. So their lengths are equal. Therefore, AC = DF. But how does this help us find AC?

Wait, but the problem says that the radius of circle G is 26. Wait, earlier we thought that points A, C, D, F are on a circle of radius 2.0, but that conflicts with the fact that the radius of circle G is 26. Unless there's a misunderstanding here. Wait, maybe the circle mentioned in the PointLiesOnCircle is different? Let me read again:

The constraints include:

PointLiesOnCircle(D, Circle(G, radius_2_0))

Same for A, F, C. So the circle is centered at G with radius 2.0. But the radius of ⊙G is 26. So there's a contradiction unless the circle with radius 2.0 is a different circle. Wait, maybe the notation is confusing. Perhaps "Circle(G, radius_2_0)" refers to a circle with center G and radius 2.0, even though the main circle (⊙G) has radius 26. So there are two circles: one with center G and radius 26 (which is the big circle), and another with center G and radius 2.0 (a smaller circle). Points A, C, D, F lie on the smaller circle (radius 2.0), while the rest of the points (like B, E) are on the big circle? 

Wait, but the problem says "If the radius of ⊙G is 26..." So ⊙G is the circle with center G and radius 26. So the circle mentioned in the PointLiesOnCircle statements (Circle(G, radius_2_0)) is a different circle, with the same center G but smaller radius. Therefore, points A, C, D, F are on a circle with radius 2.0, centered at G. So GA = GC = GD = GF = 2.0. 

Now, chords AC and DF are chords of the smaller circle (since A and C are on it, and D and F are on it). Therefore, their lengths can be determined based on their distance from the center. But according to the problem, they are equidistant from the center. Which means that the distance from G to chord AC equals the distance from G to chord DF. As previously established, this implies AC = DF. But how do we find the actual value of AC?

Wait, but maybe there's more information given. Let's look at the other constraints:

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(B, G)), 10): So the distance between B and G is 10. Similarly, the distance between E and G is 10. Also, PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(D, F)): So point E lies on line DF. And PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(A, C)): Point B lies on line AC.

Hmm. So line AC contains point B, and line DF contains point E. Also, BG = 10, EG = 10. 

This suggests that points B and E are located along lines AC and DF respectively, at a distance of 10 from G. 

But since points A and C are on the small circle (radius 2.0), the entire line AC is a chord of the small circle. But point B lies on line AC such that GB = 10. But the coordinates of G are the center of the small circle. Wait, but the small circle has radius 2.0, so the maximum distance between any two points on it is 4.0. Therefore, the line AC is a chord of the small circle, and point B is somewhere on line AC. But GB is 10. But the distance from G to any point on the small circle is at most 2.0. How can GB be 10? This seems impossible. 

Wait, there's a contradiction here. If points A and C are on a circle with radius 2.0 centered at G, then any point on line AC (including B) must be within that circle. However, GB is given as 10, which is much larger than 2.0. Therefore, my previous assumption must be wrong. 

Perhaps the circle mentioned in the PointLiesOnCircle statements is not the same as ⊙G? Wait, the problem says "the radius of ⊙G is 26", so ⊙G is the circle with center G and radius 26. The other constraints mention Circle(G, radius_2_0), which is a circle with center G and radius 2.0. So points A, C, D, F are on this smaller circle. But then, if B is a point such that GB=10, which is less than 26, so it's possible. 

Ah! So point B is outside the small circle (radius 2.0) because GB=10. Similarly for E. So line AC passes through B, and line DF passes through E. So line AC connects points A and C (on the small circle), passing through B, which is outside the small circle. Similarly for DF. 

Therefore, the chord AC of the small circle extends beyond the small circle to pass through point B, which is at distance 10 from G. Similarly for DF and point E. 

So now, how can we relate this information to find the length of AC?

We know that AC is a chord of the small circle (radius 2.0). Let me denote the length of AC as x. The distance from G to chord AC is d. From the formula:

For a chord of length x in a circle of radius r, the distance from the center is d = sqrt(r^2 - (x/2)^2).

Here, r = 2.0, so d = sqrt(4 - (x/2)^2). 

But we also know that point B lies on line AC such that GB = 10. Let me visualize this: the line AC is a chord of the small circle, and point B is on the extension of AC beyond one of the endpoints (or between A and C?), such that GB = 10. 

Wait, but depending on where B is located. Suppose that B is on line AC extended beyond C, then GB would be longer than GC. Since GC is the radius of the small circle, which is 2.0. So GB = 10 implies that B is outside the small circle. 

Let me model this mathematically. Let me consider coordinate system with G at origin. Let me place the chord AC horizontally for simplicity. Let me assume that the midpoint of AC is M. Then GM is the distance d from the center to the chord. 

Then, the coordinates of M would be (0, d) or something like that. Wait, but if AC is horizontal, then the midpoint M is vertically aligned with G. Wait, suppose the chord AC is horizontal, and G is at (0, 0). The midpoint M of AC is at distance d from G. So coordinates of M could be (0, d) if AC is horizontal. Wait, no—if the chord is horizontal, then the midpoint M is directly above or below the center. Wait, suppose the chord is horizontal, then the line connecting G to M is vertical. So coordinates of M would be (h, k), but since AC is horizontal, and the perpendicular from G to AC passes through M. 

Actually, for simplicity, let me take coordinates such that the midpoint of AC is along the y-axis. Let me set up coordinates: Let’s suppose that the midpoint M of chord AC is at (0, d), where d is the distance from G to the chord. Then, since AC is horizontal, points A and C are symmetric about the y-axis. The length of AC is x, so half-length is x/2. Then, coordinates of A would be (-x/2, d), and C would be (x/2, d). Wait, but the distance from G (at origin) to A would be sqrt[(-x/2)^2 + d^2] = sqrt(x²/4 + d²). But since A lies on the small circle (radius 2.0), this distance must equal 2.0. Therefore:

sqrt(x²/4 + d²) = 2.0 ⇒ x²/4 + d² = 4. 

Also, we know that point B lies on line AC. Let's assume that B is on the extension of AC beyond C. Then, the coordinates of B would be (something). Let me parametrize line AC. Since AC goes from A(-x/2, d) to C(x/2, d). The line AC is horizontal at height y = d. So any point on line AC has y-coordinate d. 

Point B lies on this line, so its coordinates are (b, d), where b > x/2 (assuming B is beyond C). The distance from G (origin) to B is 10. So:

GB² = b² + d² = 10² = 100.

From earlier, we had x²/4 + d² = 4 ⇒ d² = 4 - x²/4.

Substituting into GB² equation:

b² + (4 - x²/4) = 100 ⇒ b² = 100 - 4 + x²/4 = 96 + x²/4.

But also, since point B is on line AC extended beyond C, which is at x-coordinate x/2. Therefore, the coordinate b is greater than x/2. So b = x/2 + t, where t > 0. But without knowing t, this may not help directly. However, maybe we can express b in terms of x and d?

Alternatively, note that vectorially, the line AC has direction from A to C. The coordinates of B can be expressed as moving from C in the direction away from A. Wait, but perhaps there's another approach. Let me think.

Since B is on line AC, and AC has midpoint M at (0, d), but wait earlier assumption was midpoint at (0, d)? No, earlier I said that the midpoint of AC is at (0, d)? Wait, no. If the line AC is horizontal at y = d, then the midpoint M would be at ((-x/2 + x/2)/2, d)? Wait, no. The midpoint of AC is at ( ( (-x/2) + (x/2) ) / 2 , (d + d)/2 ) = (0, d). So midpoint M is at (0, d). Therefore, the distance from G (origin) to M is |GM| = sqrt(0² + d²) = |d|. 

So the distance from G to the chord AC is |d|. 

But we also have that the distance from G to B is 10. Since B is on line AC, which is horizontal at y = d. So coordinates of B are (b, d), as before. Then:

GB² = b² + d² = 100.

Additionally, since B is on line AC, which extends beyond C. Let me think about the relation between B and the chord AC. 

In particular, since AC is a chord of the small circle (radius 2.0), and B lies on line AC extended beyond C. So the power of point B with respect to the small circle can be used. The power of a point B with respect to a circle is defined as OB² - r², where O is the center and r is the radius. In this case, O is G, and r = 2.0. 

Power of B w.r.t. the small circle is GB² - (2.0)^2 = 10² - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96. 

But the power of point B with respect to the circle is also equal to the square of the tangent from B to the circle, which is equal to BA * BC, since B lies on the secant line AC. Wait, no. The power of point B is equal to the product of the lengths from B to the points of intersection with the circle. Here, line AC intersects the circle at A and C. So power of B is BA * BC. 

Wait, but BA is the distance from B to A, and BC is the distance from B to C. Wait, but since B is outside the circle, and AC is a secant line passing through A and C, then the power of B is equal to BA * BC. 

Wait, but actually, the formula is: if a line through B intersects the circle at X and Y, then BX * BY = power of B. 

In this case, the line passes through A and C, so BA * BC = power of B. Wait, but BA is from B to A, and BC is from B to C. But depending on the position of B relative to A and C. If B is outside the segment AC, then BA and BC would be directed segments. But in absolute terms, it's |BA| * |BC|. 

But since B is on the extension of AC beyond C, then BA = BC + CA. Wait, let me clarify. Let me imagine that point B is beyond C, so the order is A---C---B. Then BA is the distance from B to A, which is AC + CB. But BC is the distance from B to C. 

Alternatively, using signed lengths, if we take direction into account. But since we’re dealing with magnitudes, it's better to use the formula:

Power of B = |BA| * |BC| = 96.

But BA is the distance from B to A, and BC is the distance from B to C. 

But since B is on line AC extended beyond C, then BA = BC + CA. Wait, CA is the length of AC. Let me denote AC = x. Then, if I let BC = t, then BA = t + x. So power of B is BA * BC = (t + x) * t = t(t + x) = 96. 

But we need another equation relating t and x. 

Alternatively, since point C is on the circle, then the distance from B to C can be found via coordinates. Earlier, we had coordinates of C as (x/2, d). Coordinates of B are (b, d). So the distance BC is |b - x/2|. 

Similarly, the distance BA is the distance from B to A, which is |b - (-x/2)| = |b + x/2|. 

So power of B is BA * BC = |b + x/2| * |b - x/2| = |b² - (x/2)^2| = 96. 

But from earlier, we had that GB² = b² + d² = 100. Also, from the circle equation for point A, we had:

GA² = (-x/2)^2 + d² = x²/4 + d² = 4. 

So combining equations:

From GA²: x²/4 + d² = 4 ⇒ d² = 4 - x²/4.

From GB²: b² + d² = 100 ⇒ b² = 100 - d² = 100 - (4 - x²/4) = 96 + x²/4.

Thus, b² = 96 + x²/4.

Now, returning to the power of point B:

|b² - (x/2)^2| = 96.

But b² = 96 + x²/4. Substitute:

|96 + x²/4 - x²/4| = |96| = 96. 

Which matches the power of point B. So this gives us no new information. It just confirms consistency. Hence, this approach leads to an identity, not helping us find x.

Hmm. So this suggests that we need another method. Let me think differently.

We know that AC is a chord of the small circle (radius 2.0), so its length x satisfies x = 2√(r² - d²), where d is the distance from the center to the chord. But we don't know d yet. However, we also have that point B lies on line AC such that GB = 10. 

Alternatively, considering triangles involving G, B, and the midpoint of AC. Let me think about the triangle formed by G, B, and M (midpoint of AC). 

Earlier, we considered that the midpoint M of AC is at distance d from G. So GM = d. The coordinates of M were (0, d) in the previous setup. Now, point B is on line AC, which is horizontal at y = d. So the line AC is horizontal at height y = d, and point B is somewhere on that line. 

So the line from G to M is vertical (from origin to (0,d)). The line from G to B is a line from (0,0) to (b, d). The length of GB is 10. 

So the distance between (0,0) and (b, d) is √(b² + d²) = 10. We already know that from earlier. Also, since point M is the midpoint of AC, which is at (0, d), then the distance from G to M is d. 

But how does this help us? Maybe using similar triangles or something else?

Alternatively, since B lies on line AC, which passes through M (midpoint). Let me denote BM as the distance from B to M. Then, since M is the midpoint of AC, and B is on line AC, then we can write BM = |b - 0|, assuming M is at (0, d). Wait, no. If M is at (0, d), then coordinates of M are (0, d). Coordinates of B are (b, d). So BM is the horizontal distance from B to M: |b - 0| = |b|. 

So BM = |b|. 

But also, the distance from G to M is d, and the distance from G to B is 10. So triangle GMB has sides GM = d, BM = |b|, and GB = 10. By Pythagoras, if angle at M is right angle? Wait, no, unless the triangle is right-angled. Is there a relationship here?

Wait, since M is the midpoint of AC, and G is the center, then GM is perpendicular to AC. Because in a circle, the line from the center to the midpoint of a chord is perpendicular to the chord. So GM is perpendicular to AC. Therefore, triangle GMB is a right triangle at M. Because GM is perpendicular to AC, and B lies on AC, so GM is perpendicular to MB. Thus, triangle GMB is right-angled at M. 

Yes! So triangle GMB is right-angled at M. Therefore, by Pythagoras:

GM² + MB² = GB²

Which is:

d² + b² = 10² = 100.

But earlier, we had from the circle condition:

x²/4 + d² = 4.

And from GB²:

b² + d² = 100.

So substituting d² from the second equation into the first:

x²/4 + (100 - b²) = 4 ⇒ x²/4 = 4 - 100 + b² ⇒ x²/4 = b² - 96 ⇒ x² = 4(b² - 96).

But we also need another relationship between b and x. 

Since point B lies on line AC, and M is the midpoint of AC, then the distance from B to M is |b|, and the distance from M to A is x/2. Wait, no. The coordinates of M are (0, d), and A is at (-x/2, d), so the distance from M to A is |-x/2 - 0| = x/2. Similarly, the distance from M to C is x/2. 

Since B is on line AC, and assuming it's on the extension beyond C, then the distance from M to B is |BM| = |b - 0| = |b|. Depending on direction. 

But if M is the midpoint of AC, then the distance from M to B depends on where B is. Let me think in terms of vectors. 

Assume that B is beyond C, so from M to C is x/2, then from C to B is some length. Let me define that the total distance from M to B is MB = |b|. 

But since the distance from M to C is x/2, then the distance from C to B is MB - MC if B is beyond C. Wait, if M is the midpoint, then from M to C is x/2. If B is beyond C, then the distance from C to B is MB - MC? Not sure. Let me think numerically. 

Suppose the coordinates of M are (0, d). Coordinates of C are (x/2, d). So the distance from M to C is x/2. If B is at (b, d), then the distance from C to B is |b - x/2|. 

Also, the distance from M to B is |b - 0| = |b|. 

So we have:

distance from C to B = |b - x/2|

distance from M to C = x/2

But since B is beyond C, then b > x/2, so |b - x/2| = b - x/2.

Also, the distance from M to B is |b| = b (since b > x/2 ≥ 0, assuming x positive).

So we have:

MB = b

MC = x/2

CB = b - x/2

But how does this help?

Well, perhaps using the fact that in triangle GMB, we have d² + b² = 100, and from the circle condition, x²/4 + d² = 4. 

From these two equations:

From circle: d² = 4 - x²/4

Substitute into GB equation:

4 - x²/4 + b² = 100 ⇒ b² = 100 - 4 + x²/4 = 96 + x²/4

But also, from the distance from C to B: CB = b - x/2.

But CB is also related to the power of point B. Earlier, we saw that power of B is BA * BC = 96. 

But BA is the distance from B to A. Since A is at (-x/2, d), and B is at (b, d), then BA = b - (-x/2) = b + x/2. 

So power of B is BA * BC = (b + x/2)(b - x/2) = b² - (x/2)² = 96.

But earlier, we had b² = 96 + x²/4. Substituting into this expression:

b² - (x²)/4 = (96 + x²/4) - x²/4 = 96. 

Which checks out. Again, this gives no new info. So we still need another equation to solve for x. 

Is there anything else given in the problem? Let's see. The problem also mentions that chords AC and DF are equidistant from the center. Which we've already considered, leading to AC = DF. But since DF is another chord of the small circle, and similarly, there's a point E on line DF such that GE = 10. So by symmetry, the same reasoning applies to DF. 

But since AC and DF are equidistant from the center, their respective distances from G are equal. Which we've already used to say that AC = DF. But this doesn't give us new information. 

Wait, but since both chords AC and DF are equidistant from G, and both are chords of the small circle, then their lengths are equal. So AC = DF. However, we need to find AC. 

But how? Maybe there's something missing. Let's go back. 

We have the equation from the power of point B: b² - (x/2)² = 96. And we also have from the circle condition: x²/4 + d² = 4, and from GB: b² + d² = 100. 

Let me try to combine these equations. 

From x²/4 + d² = 4, we get d² = 4 - x²/4.

From b² + d² = 100, substitute d²:

b² + 4 - x²/4 = 100 ⇒ b² = 96 + x²/4.

Now, from the power of point B: b² - x²/4 = 96.

But substituting b² from above:

(96 + x²/4) - x²/4 = 96 = 96. 

Again, this is consistent but doesn't give x. So we need another equation. 

Wait, but what about the other chord DF? Since DF is also a chord of the small circle, and there's a point E on line DF such that GE = 10. So by the same logic as with point B, we can derive that for DF, the same equation holds. 

But since AC and DF are equidistant from the center, their lengths are equal. But since we don't have any additional information about DF, this doesn't help. 

Wait, unless there's something about the positions of points B and E. Are there any relations between them? 

The problem states:

PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(D, F)): E is on DF.

PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(A, C)): B is on AC.

But no direct relation between B and E. 

Unless there's symmetry. Since AC and DF are equidistant from the center, and their corresponding points B and E are at distance 10 from G. But since the situation is symmetrical, perhaps the length AC is determined uniquely. 

But how? 

Wait, maybe we can consider that for both chords AC and DF, the same conditions apply. So for each chord, we have:

For AC: b² - (x/2)^2 = 96, where x is AC's length.

For DF: similar equation, but with variables for DF. But since AC = DF, it doesn't add new info. 

So we're stuck. There must be something missing here. 

Wait, let me think again about the Power of a Point. For point B, power w.r.t. the small circle is 96. This is equal to BA * BC. 

But BA * BC = 96. Also, BA = distance from B to A, and BC = distance from B to C. 

But since AC is a chord of the small circle, and A and C are on the circle, then the length of AC is x. 

But BA * BC = 96. 

Let me express BA and BC in terms of x and other variables. 

If we consider that B lies on the extension of AC beyond C, then BA = AC + CB. Wait, no. If B is beyond C, then BA = BC + AC. 

Wait, no. Let me draw it mentally: A----C----B. So from B to A is the full length BA = BC + AC. But AC is the length from A to C, and BC is from B to C. So BA = BC + AC. 

But in terms of lengths, if I let AC = x, and let BC = t, then BA = x + t. 

So power of point B is BA * BC = (x + t)*t = 96. 

But we also know that point C is on the small circle, so GC = 2.0. 

But point B is at distance GB = 10 from G. 

Maybe we can relate t with other quantities. 

Let me consider triangle GBC. Point G is the center, point C is on the circle, and point B is outside. 

GC = 2.0, GB = 10, and BC = t. 

Using the Law of Cosines on triangle GBC:

GB² = GC² + BC² - 2*GC*BC*cos(theta), where theta is the angle at C. 

But I don't know theta. 

Alternatively, using the Law of Cosines:

GB² = GC² + BC² - 2*GC*BC*cos(angle GCB). 

Not helpful without knowing the angle. 

Alternatively, using the Law of Cosines on triangle GMC, where M is midpoint of AC. 

Wait, earlier we had that triangle GMB is right-angled. 

But perhaps using coordinates again. 

Let me return to the coordinate system where G is at (0,0), and line AC is horizontal at y = d, with midpoint M at (0, d). Point C is at (x/2, d), point B is at (b, d). 

Distance from G to C is 2.0:

GC² = (x/2)^2 + d² = 4. 

Which is the same as the earlier equation. 

Also, distance from G to B is 10:

GB² = b² + d² = 100. 

And from the power of point B: b² - (x/2)^2 = 96.

So we have three equations:

1. (x/2)^2 + d² = 4  
2. b² + d² = 100  
3. b² - (x/2)^2 = 96  

Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:  
(b² + d²) - [(x/2)^2 + d²] = 100 - 4  
=> b² - (x/2)^2 = 96. Which is exactly equation 3. 

So again, this is consistent, but no new info. 

So we need to find x, but we only have one equation involving x: equation 1: (x/2)^2 + d² = 4. 

But we need to eliminate d. From equation 2: d² = 100 - b². Substitute into equation 1: 

(x/2)^2 + (100 - b²) = 4 => (x/2)^2 = 4 - 100 + b² => (x/2)^2 = b² - 96. 

But from equation 3: b² - (x/2)^2 = 96 => (x/2)^2 = b² - 96. 

So this is consistent. 

But how do we find b or x? It seems underdetermined. 

Wait, but perhaps there's another constraint from the fact that points D and F are on the small circle, and point E lies on line DF with GE = 10. By the same logic as with point B, we can derive the same equation for DF. Since AC and DF are equidistant from the center, their lengths are equal, but this doesn't help. 

Wait, but maybe there's something about the configuration. For instance, since both AC and DF are chords of the small circle, and both have points B and E at distance 10 from G, and the chords are equidistant from G, but we don't know the exact positions. 

Wait, but if AC and DF are equidistant from G, then their distances from G are equal. Let me call this common distance d. 

For each chord, the distance from G is d, so for chord AC, d = sqrt(r² - (x/2)^2), where r = 2.0. 

But also, from the earlier analysis, for point B on line AC, we have the relation from the right triangle GMB: d² + b² = 100. 

But d is also equal to sqrt(4 - (x/2)^2). 

So substituting d² = 4 - x²/4 into the equation:

4 - x²/4 + b² = 100 ⇒ b² = 96 + x²/4. 

But from the power of point B: b² - x²/4 = 96. 

Which gives b² = 96 + x²/4. 

So this is the same as before. 

But without another equation, we cannot determine x. 

Wait, but maybe there's a minimum or maximum possible value for x? Since x is the length of a chord of the small circle (radius 2.0), its maximum possible length is 4.0 (the diameter). But the problem says that the radius of ⊙G is 26, but the small circle has radius 2.0. 

But in our earlier analysis, we have that x²/4 = b² - 96. Since x²/4 must be non-negative, then b² >= 96. So b >= sqrt(96) ≈ 9.798. 

But from the equation b² = 96 + x²/4, and since x <= 4, x²/4 <= 4. So b² <= 96 + 4 = 100 ⇒ b <= 10. 

So b ranges from sqrt(96) to 10. 

But this still doesn't give us the exact value of x. 

Wait, but maybe there's something else. Since points A and C are on the small circle, and line AC passes through B, which is at distance 10 from G. But the maximum possible distance from G to a point on line AC is... Well, since AC is a chord of the small circle, the farthest point on line AC from G would be the endpoint of the line extending from the circle in the direction away from G. 

Wait, but if B is on line AC extended beyond C, then GB is the distance from G to B. Since G is the center of the small circle, and C is on the circle, the maximum possible GB occurs when B is diametrically opposed to the direction of C. But without knowing the direction, it's hard to tell. 

But in this case, GB is fixed at 10. So perhaps we can relate this to the length of AC. 

Wait, let's think of the line AC as passing through B. The distance from G to B is 10, and the distance from G to C is 2.0. So in triangle GBC, we have sides GC = 2.0, GB = 10, and BC = t (unknown). 

By the Law of Cosines:

GB² = GC² + BC² - 2*GC*BC*cos(theta), where theta is the angle at C. 

But we don't know theta. 

Alternatively, using the Law of Cosines in triangle GBC:

10² = 2.0² + t² - 2*2.0*t*cos(theta). 

But without knowing theta, this isn't helpful. 

Wait, but if we consider that point C is on the small circle, and line AC is a chord, then the angle at C relates to the arc AC. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, since AC is a chord of the small circle, the angle at G subtended by AC is θ, where cosθ = (r² - (x/2)^2)/r². Wait, no. The central angle θ for chord AC is such that x = 2r sin(θ/2). 

Wait, for a chord of length x in a circle of radius r, x = 2r sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle. 

So x = 2*2*sin(θ/2) = 4 sin(θ/2). 

But I'm not sure if this helps. 

Alternatively, the distance from G to AC is d = r cos(θ/2). 

Wait, because if you draw the perpendicular from G to AC, it splits the central angle θ into two equal parts. So the distance d is r cos(θ/2). 

But also, x = 2r sin(θ/2). 

So we have d = r cos(θ/2) and x = 2r sin(θ/2). 

Dividing these, x/d = 2r tan(θ/2). 

But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, from x = 2√(r² - d²), which we have from before. 

But we also have from the right triangle GMB: d² + b² = 100. 

And from the circle: x²/4 + d² = 4. 

So let's try to solve for x. 

Let me write down the two equations:

1. x²/4 + d² = 4  
2. d² + b² = 100  

But from equation 1, d² = 4 - x²/4. Substitute into equation 2: 

4 - x²/4 + b² = 100 ⇒ b² = 96 + x²/4. 

But we also have from the power of point B: b² - x²/4 = 96. 

Which is the same as b² = 96 + x²/4. So again, no new info. 

Wait, but if we assume that the line AC is such that point B is at distance 10 from G, and the minimal possible value of b is sqrt(96), and maximal is 10. 

But how to connect this to x? 

Let me think about the maximum and minimum values of x. 

Since x is the length of a chord of the small circle (radius 2.0), x can range from 0 to 4.0. 

But from the equation b² = 96 + x²/4, since b² must be ≤ 100 (since x²/4 ≤ 4), then 96 + x²/4 ≤ 100 ⇒ x²/4 ≤ 4 ⇒ x² ≤ 16 ⇒ x ≤ 4. Which is consistent. 

But how to find x? 

Wait, but maybe there's a unique solution if we consider that both chords AC and DF are equidistant from G, and both have points B and E at distance 10 from G. But since the problem gives us the radius of ⊙G as 26, but the small circle has radius 2.0, perhaps there's a relation between the two? 

Wait, but the radius of ⊙G is 26, but the small circle is inside it. But how does that affect the calculation? 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the small circle is the one with radius 2.0. Let me recheck the problem statement. 

The problem says: 

PointLiesOnCircle(D, Circle(G, radius_2_0)) 

So Circle(G, radius_2_0) is a circle with center G and radius 2.0. The radius of ⊙G is 26. So ⊙G is a different circle, possibly the larger one. But the points A, C, D, F are on the smaller circle. 

Wait, but why is the radius of ⊙G given as 26? Is there a connection? 

Maybe the chords AC and DF are not chords of the small circle, but of the larger circle ⊙G? 

Wait, let me re-read the problem statement. 

The question says: "Chords AC and DF are equidistant from the center. If the radius of ⊙G is 26, find AC."

So the center is G, and the radius is 26. So chords AC and DF are chords of the larger circle ⊙G, with radius 26. 

But earlier, we thought that points A, C, D, F are on the smaller circle. But this contradicts, unless the smaller circle is part of the larger one. 

Wait, maybe the points A, C, D, F are on the larger circle? Let me re-examine the constraints. 

The PointLiesOnCircle(D, Circle(G, radius_2_0)) means that D is on a circle centered at G with radius 2.0. So it's a smaller circle inside ⊙G (which has radius 26). So points A, C, D, F are on the smaller circle. 

But then chords AC and DF are chords of the smaller circle, but the problem says they are equidistant from the center G (of the larger circle). Wait, but the distance from G to a chord is measured in the larger circle. 

Wait, this changes things! 

Previously, I assumed that the chords AC and DF are of the small circle, but if they are chords of the larger circle ⊙G (radius 26), then their distance from G would be computed in the context of the larger circle. 

But how can points A and C be on the smaller circle, yet be endpoints of a chord of the larger circle? 

Wait, if points A and C are on the smaller circle (radius 2.0), then they are also on the larger circle (radius 26)? No, unless the smaller circle is a subset of the larger one. But if the smaller circle has radius 2.0, and the larger has radius 26, then points A and C are inside the larger circle. 

But then, chords AC and DF would be chords of the larger circle, but their endpoints are inside the larger circle. Wait, but a chord of a circle must have both endpoints on the circle. So if points A and C are inside the larger circle, then AC is not a chord of the larger circle. 

This suggests a contradiction. 

So there must be a misinterpretation. Let me re-express the problem carefully. 

The problem says:

- PointLiesOnCircle(D, Circle(G, radius_2_0)): D is on a circle centered at G with radius 2.0. Same for A, F, C.

- The radius of ⊙G is 26. So ⊙G is a circle with center G and radius 26. 

So the points A, C, D, F are on a circle of radius 2.0 centered at G. These points are inside ⊙G. 

Now, the question is about chords AC and DF being equidistant from the center G. Since G is the center of both circles, the distance from G to the chord AC is the perpendicular distance from G to the line AC. 

But since A and C are on the smaller circle (radius 2.0), the line AC is a chord of the smaller circle, and hence its distance from G is d = sqrt(r² - (AC/2)^2) = sqrt(4 - (AC/2)^2). 

But the problem states that chords AC and DF are equidistant from the center, so their distances are equal, implying AC = DF. 

But how does this help us? 

Wait, but the problem also provides that BG = 10 and EG = 10, with B on line AC and E on line DF. 

So, for example, point B is on line AC, and GB = 10. Since G is the center of the smaller circle, and A and C are on the smaller circle, then the line AC is a chord of the smaller circle, and B is a point on the line AC extended such that GB = 10. 

But the distance from G to the line AC is d, and B is a point on line AC such that GB = 10. 

So using the same approach as before, with the right triangle GMB, where M is the midpoint of AC, and GM = d, MB = b, then GB = sqrt(d² + b²) = 10. 

From the smaller circle, we have d² + (AC/2)^2 = 4. 

So, let's denote AC = x. Then:

d² + (x/2)^2 = 4. 

And from GB: d² + b² = 100. 

Also, from the power of point B: b² - (x/2)^2 = 96. 

As before, this leads to the same equations. 

But since we have two equations:

1. d² + (x/2)^2 = 4  
2. d² + b² = 100  
3. b² - (x/2)^2 = 96 

From 1 and 3: Subtract 1 from 3: 

(b² - x²/4) - (d² + x²/4) = 96 - 4  
b² - x²/4 - d² - x²/4 = 92  
b² - d² - x²/2 = 92 

But from equation 2: d² = 100 - b². Substitute into above:

b² - (100 - b²) - x²/2 = 92  
b² - 100 + b² - x²/2 = 92  
2b² - x²/2 = 192  
Multiply both sides by 2:  
4b² - x² = 384. 

But from equation 1: d² = 4 - x²/4. 

And from equation 2: d² = 100 - b². 

So 4 - x²/4 = 100 - b² ⇒ b² = 100 - 4 + x²/4 = 96 + x²/4. 

Substitute into 4b² - x² = 384: 

4*(96 + x²/4) - x² = 384  
384 + x² - x² = 384  
384 = 384. 

Again, an identity. 

This means that the equations are dependent, and we cannot determine x from them. 

So what is the missing piece? 

Wait, but the problem says that the radius of ⊙G is 26. How is this relevant? 

Ah! Perhaps the points A, C, D, F are on the smaller circle (radius 2.0), but the chords AC and DF are also chords of the larger circle ⊙G (radius 26). Wait, but how? 

If points A and C are on the smaller circle, then they are inside the larger circle. So the line AC is a chord of the larger circle only if A and C are on the larger circle. But they are not, since they are on the smaller circle. 

This suggests that there's a misinterpretation. 

Wait, perhaps the PointLiesOnCircle(D, Circle(G, radius_2_0)) is a typo, and it should be PointLiesOnCircle(D, Circle(G, radius_26))? Or perhaps the radius_2_0 is meant to be 26? 

But the user wrote: "PointLiesOnCircle(D, Circle(G, radius_2_0))" which likely means radius 2.0. 

Alternatively, maybe the radius_2_0 is 26. Maybe the notation is ambiguous. 

If the radius_2_0 is actually 26, then points A, C, D, F are on the larger circle, and the distance from G to the chords AC and DF is calculated in the context of the larger circle. 

Let me try this alternative interpretation. Assume that the radius_2_0 is 26, so points A, C, D, F are on the larger circle ⊙G (radius 26). Then, the chords AC and DF are chords of this larger circle, and they are equidistant from G. 

In this case, the distance from G to each chord is the same. For a chord of a circle, the distance from the center to the chord is d = sqrt(r² - (l/2)^2), where l is the length of the chord. 

Since the chords are equidistant, their lengths are equal. So AC = DF. 

But how to find AC? 

But we also have points B and E such that GB = 10 and EG = 10. 

Point B is on line AC, and point E is on line DF. 

So similar to before, for each chord AC and DF, we can use the power of point B and E. 

Let me try this approach. 

Assuming that points A and C are on the larger circle (radius 26), and B is on line AC such that GB = 10. 

Using the same power of point B: BA * BC = GB² - r², where r is the radius of the circle. Wait, no. The power of a point B with respect to the circle is GB² - r². But if B is outside the circle, it's positive, and equals to BA * BC. 

Wait, if B is outside the circle, then power of B is equal to BA * BC = GB² - r². 

But in this case, if B is on line AC, and A and C are on the circle, then B is outside the circle. So:

BA * BC = GB² - r² = 10² - 26² = 100 - 676 = -576. 

But since B is outside, the power should be positive. This suggests a contradiction. 

Wait, no. If B is inside the circle, the power is negative. If B is outside, it's positive. 

But if B is on line AC, and A and C are on the circle, then depending on where B is, it can be inside or outside. 

If B is between A and C, then it's inside the circle. If it's outside, then it's outside. 

But given that GB = 10, and the radius is 26, it's possible for B to be inside or outside. 

Let me calculate: if B is on line AC, and A and C are on the circle (radius 26), then the maximum possible distance from G to B would be 26 + 26 = 52, and minimum 0. Since GB = 10 < 26, B is inside the circle. 

So the power of point B is negative: GB² - r² = 100 - 676 = -576. 

But the power of point B is also equal to -BA * BC, since B is inside the circle. 

Wait, the formula is: if B is inside the circle, then for any chord through B, BA * BC = r² - GB². Wait, no. The correct formula is: for a point inside the circle, the product of the segments of any chord through B is equal to the power, which is r² - GB². 

Wait, let me recall: the power of a point B with respect to a circle is defined as: 

If B is outside: PA * PB = BT², where PA and PB are the segments of the secant, and BT is the tangent.

If B is inside: PA * PB = r² - OB², where PA and PB are the segments of the chord passing through B.

Wait, more precisely, if a line through B intersects the circle at A and C, then BA * BC = r² - GB². 

Wait, but in this case, since B is inside, the power is negative, and BA * BC = -(distance from B to center squared - r²)? No, let me check.

Actually, the correct formula is: for a point B inside the circle, if a line through B intersects the circle at A and C, then BA * BC = r² - GB². 

Wait, let me verify with coordinates. Let's say G is at origin, B is at (0, 0), and the circle has radius r. A line through B (which is the center) intersects the circle at A and C. Then BA * BC = (distance from B to A) * (distance from B to C). Since B is the center, BA = r, BC = r, so BA * BC = r². And r² - GB² = r² - 0 = r². So it works. 

If B is at distance d from G, and the line through B intersects the circle at A and C, then BA * BC = r² - d². 

So in our case, B is at distance 10 from G, and the line AC passes through B, intersecting the circle at A and C. So BA * BC = r² - GB² = 26² - 10² = 676 - 100 = 576. 

But since B is between A and C, BA and BC are signed lengths. Let me assume that B is between A and C, so that BA = -AB and BC = -BC, but the product would be positive. 

Actually, if B is between A and C, then AB * BC = (length from A to B) * (length from B to C) = AB * BC. 

But the formula says that AB * BC = r² - GB² = 576. 

So AB * BC = 576. 

But also, AC = AB + BC. Let me denote AB = x, BC = y, so that AC = x + y, and x * y = 576. 

But we need to find AC = x + y. 

But we have only one equation: x*y = 576. 

But we need another equation. 

Wait, but since AC is a chord of the circle, its length can also be calculated using the distance from G to the chord. 

Let me denote d as the distance from G to the line AC. 

Then, the length of AC is 2√(r² - d²) = 2√(26² - d²). 

But also, since B is on AC, and GB = 10, we can relate d and the position of B. 

Let me consider the distance from G to the line AC is d. The point B is on line AC at distance 10 from G. 

The distance from G to the line AC is d, and the distance from G to B is 10. 

Using the formula for the distance from a point to a line: if the line AC is at distance d from G, and B is a point on line AC at distance 10 from G, then the distance from G to B can be related to d and the projection of GB onto the line AC. 

Let me think: if we drop a perpendicular from G to line AC, meeting at point M, then GM = d. The point B is on line AC, so the distance from G to B is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs GM = d and MB. 

So GB² = GM² + MB² => 10² = d² + MB² => MB² = 100 - d². 

But MB is the distance from M to B along the line AC. 

Now, since AC is a chord of the circle, and M is the midpoint of AC, then AM = MC = AC/2. 

Let me denote AC = L. Then, AM = L/2. 

Now, if B is on line AC, then MB = |AM - AB| or |AB - AM|, depending on the position of B. 

But since B is between A and C, then MB = |AM - AB| or something like that. 

Wait, let me assume that B is between A and M or between M and C. 

But without loss of generality, let's assume that B is between A and C. Then, MB = |AM - AB| or similar. 

Alternatively, if we consider that M is the midpoint, then the distance from M to B is MB. 

Then, the length from A to B is AM - MB if B is between A and M, or MB - AM if B is between M and C. 

But this seems complex. 

However, we can relate MB with the length AC and the position of B. 

Let me use the fact that AB * BC = 576. 

Also, AC = AB + BC = L. 

Let me set AB = x, BC = y, so x * y = 576 and x + y = L. 

We need to find L. 

But we need another equation relating x and y. 

From the geometry, we have that the distance from G to line AC is d = GM. 

Also, from the right triangle: MB² = 100 - d². 

But MB is the distance from M to B. 

If B is between A and C, then MB = |AM - AB| or something. 

Let me assume that B is between A and M. Then, AB = AM - MB. 

Wait, if M is the midpoint of AC, then AM = L/2. 

If B is between A and M, then AB = AM - MB = L/2 - MB. 

Similarly, BC = AM + MB = L/2 + MB. 

But AB * BC = (L/2 - MB)(L/2 + MB) = (L/2)^2 - MB² = 576. 

But from the earlier relation, MB² = 100 - d². 

Also, from the length of the chord AC: L = 2√(r² - d²) = 2√(676 - d²). 

So, let's substitute:

(L/2)^2 - MB² = 576  
=> (L²/4) - (100 - d²) = 576  
But L²/4 = 676 - d² (from the chord length formula). 

So:

(676 - d²) - 100 + d² = 576  
676 - 100 = 576  
576 = 576. 

Again, this is an identity. So no new information. 

This suggests that the equations are consistent but underdetermined. 

But the problem states that the chords AC and DF are equidistant from the center, which we've already used to say that their lengths are equal. But since both AC and DF satisfy the same conditions, this doesn't help. 

But the problem provides answer choices, and we need to pick one. Given that the radius of the larger circle is 26, and GB = 10, and the product AB * BC = 576, and we need to find AC = L. 

But since AB * BC = 576 and AC = AB + BC, we need to find L such that there exist x and y with x + y = L and xy = 576. 

To maximize or minimize L, we can use the AM-GM inequality: for x, y > 0, x + y ≥ 2√(xy) = 2√576 = 2*24 = 48. So the minimum possible L is 48, achieved when x = y = 24. 

But since B is between A and C, and the maximum possible length of AC is the diameter of the circle, which is 52. 

Wait, the diameter is 52, so AC can be at most 52. But the minimum possible AC is 48. 

But the problem asks to find AC. Since it's possible for AC to be 48, and given the answer choices include D. 48, this might be the answer. 

But why 48? Because if AB * BC = 576 and AC = AB + BC, the minimum possible AC is 48, achieved when AB = BC = 24. 

But why would the minimum be the answer? Because if B is the midpoint of AC, then AB = BC = L/2, and AB * BC = (L/2)^2 = 576 => L/2 = 24 => L = 48. 

So this suggests that the minimum possible length of AC is 48, and since the problem states that the chords are equidistant from the center, which would require AC to be this minimum length. 

But why would the minimum be the case? Because if the distance from G to the line AC is maximized, which would correspond to the minimum length of AC. 

Wait, the distance from G to the line AC is d = sqrt(r² - (L/2)^2). To maximize d, we need to minimize L. 

But in our case, the distance from G to the line AC is d, and we also have that GB = 10, which is related to d through the right triangle: GB² = d² + MB². 

If we assume that B is the midpoint of AC (so MB = 0), then d = 10. But then the length L = 2√(r² - d²) = 2√(676 - 100) = 2√576 = 48. 

This matches the minimum possible length of AC, which is 48. 

But why would B be the midpoint? Because if B is the midpoint, then MB = 0, and GB = 10 = d. 

But the problem doesn't state that B is the midpoint, only that it's on line AC. 

However, since the problem states that the chords AC and DF are equidistant from the center, and both have points B and E at distance 10 from G, it's possible that this setup requires the minimum length of AC, which is 48. 

Thus, the answer is D. 48. 

This makes sense, and fits with the given answer choices. 

So Final Answer: D.
