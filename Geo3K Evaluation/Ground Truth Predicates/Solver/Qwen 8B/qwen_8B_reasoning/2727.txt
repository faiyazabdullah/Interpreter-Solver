====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. So I need to find the measure of angle Z based on the given geometric constraints. Let me try to visualize the problem first. 

The problem says that there are points Z, X, Y. The length of line ZX is 9 units, and the length of line XY is 5 units. Also, lines YX and YZ are perpendicular. Wait, so line YX is perpendicular to line YZ? That means that at point Y, the two lines form a right angle. So triangle XYZ has a right angle at Y?

Wait, hold on. If lines YX and YZ are perpendicular, then the angle at Y between those two lines is 90 degrees. So triangle XYZ is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at Y. But then we have sides YX = 5, YZ... Hmm, wait, but the length of YZ isn't directly given. Wait, the given lengths are ZX = 9 and YX = 5. So maybe I need to use Pythagoras here?

Let me sketch this mentally. Points Y, X, Z. At point Y, there's a right angle between YX and YZ. So Y is connected to X (length 5) and to Z (unknown length). Then, the distance from Z to X is 9. So triangle YXZ is a right triangle with legs YX = 5 and YZ (let's call it 'a'), hypotenuse ZX = 9. Wait, no. Wait, in a right triangle, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. Since the right angle is at Y, then the hypotenuse would be XZ. Therefore, XZ is the hypotenuse, which is given as 9. So according to Pythagoras:

YX² + YZ² = XZ²  
So plugging in numbers:  
5² + YZ² = 9²  
Calculating:  
25 + YZ² = 81  
YZ² = 81 - 25 = 56  
Therefore, YZ = sqrt(56) ≈ 7.483...

But how does this help me find angle Z? Angle Z is at point Z. In triangle XYZ, angle at Z. So let me think about the angles. In a right-angled triangle, the angles can be found using trigonometry. Since we know the sides adjacent and opposite to angle Z.

Wait, angle Z is at vertex Z. Let me consider triangle XYZ. The right angle is at Y. So the sides relative to angle Z: the side opposite to angle Z is YX, which is 5. The side adjacent to angle Z is YZ, which is sqrt(56). And the hypotenuse is XZ = 9.

Alternatively, perhaps using tangent? Because tan(angle Z) = opposite / adjacent. Wait, angle Z is at point Z. Let me clarify the triangle again.

In triangle XYZ, with right angle at Y. So:

- Point Y is the right angle.
- Side YX = 5 (from Y to X)
- Side YZ = sqrt(56) (from Y to Z)
- Hypotenuse XZ = 9 (from X to Z)

Now, angle at Z. To find angle Z, we can use trigonometric ratios. Let me label the triangle properly.

At angle Z, the sides are:

Opposite side: This would be the side opposite angle Z. Which is YX, since angle Z is at point Z. So the side opposite angle Z is YX, which is 5.

Adjacent side: The side adjacent to angle Z is YZ, which is sqrt(56).

Therefore, tan(angle Z) = opposite / adjacent = 5 / sqrt(56)

Compute that value. Let me calculate 5 divided by sqrt(56). First compute sqrt(56):

sqrt(56) = sqrt(4*14) = 2*sqrt(14) ≈ 2 * 3.7417 ≈ 7.483

So tan(angle Z) ≈ 5 / 7.483 ≈ 0.668

Then, take arctangent of that. Let me compute arctan(0.668). Using calculator steps.

I remember that tan(33.7 degrees) is approximately 0.666, which is close to 0.668. Let me check:

tan(33.7°): Let me recall that tan(30°) is about 0.577, tan(35°) is approx 0.700. So 0.668 is between 33.7 and 34 degrees. Let me do more precise calculation.

Alternatively, compute arctan(5/sqrt(56)).

Alternatively, perhaps simplify the fraction. Let me rationalize or write it as exact terms. Alternatively, use exact values.

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let me check if I made a mistake in identifying the opposite and adjacent sides.

Wait, angle at Z. Let me imagine triangle XYZ with right angle at Y. So, vertices Y, X, Z. So angle at Z is between sides ZY and ZX. So the sides forming angle Z are ZY and ZX. The side opposite angle Z is YX. Yes, because in triangle XYZ, angle Z is opposite to side YX.

Yes, so tan(angle Z) = opposite / adjacent = YX / YZ = 5 / sqrt(56)

Which is approximately 5/7.483 ≈ 0.668.

So arctan(0.668) is approximately ?

Well, using a calculator, if I don't have one, but I can approximate.

We know that tan(33°) ≈ 0.6494, tan(34°) ≈ 0.6745. Our value is 0.668, which is between these two.

Let me compute the difference. Between 33° and 34°, tan increases from ~0.6494 to ~0.6745, which is an increase of roughly 0.0251 over 1 degree. Our value is 0.668, which is 0.668 - 0.6494 = 0.0186 above 33°. So proportionally, 0.0186 / 0.0251 ≈ 0.74. So approximately 33° + 0.74° ≈ 33.74°, which is about 33.7 degrees. Looking at the answer choices, option B is 33.7. So that seems like the answer.

Alternatively, maybe I should verify my calculation using exact computation.

Alternatively, maybe I can use sine or cosine instead. For example, sin(angle Z) = opposite / hypotenuse = 5 / 9 ≈ 0.5555. Then arcsin(5/9) is also possible. Let me check that.

sin(theta) = 5/9 ≈ 0.5555. What's arcsin(0.5555)? Well, sin(33.7°) is approx 0.5543. Close enough. So theta ≈ 33.7 degrees. Hence, same answer.

So both methods give around 33.7 degrees. Therefore, answer choice B is 33.7, so the correct answer is B.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the angle. Let me confirm once again.

Angle Z is at point Z. In triangle XYZ, with right angle at Y. So angle Z is one of the acute angles. The sides:

Opposite angle Z: YX = 5

Hypotenuse: XZ = 9

Therefore, sin(angle Z) = opposite / hypotenuse = 5/9 ≈ 0.5555. So angle Z ≈ arcsin(5/9). Let me calculate that precisely.

Using a calculator for better accuracy (pretending I have one here). Let me compute arcsin(5/9):

First, 5 divided by 9 is approximately 0.555555...

Looking up arcsin(0.5555)... Well, knowing that sin(33°) ≈ 0.5446, sin(34°)=~0.5592. So 0.5555 lies between these two. Let me interpolate.

Difference between sin(33°) and sin(34°) is 0.5592 - 0.5446 = 0.0146 per degree.

Our target is 0.5555 - 0.5446 = 0.0109 above sin(33°). So fraction is 0.0109 / 0.0146 ≈ 0.746. Therefore, angle ≈ 33° + 0.746° ≈ 33.746°, which rounds to 33.7°, matching answer choice B.

Alternatively, using the tan method earlier gave us approximately 33.7° as well. So regardless of the method, answer is B.

Another way: Use coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to the points to verify.

Let’s place point Y at the origin (0,0). Since lines YX and YZ are perpendicular, let's assume YX is along the x-axis and YZ is along the y-axis.

So, point Y is (0,0). Since YX = 5, and assuming it's along x-axis, then point X is at (5, 0). Now, point Z is somewhere along the y-axis, since YZ is vertical. Let’s say point Z is at (0, b), where b is the length YZ. Then, the distance between Z (0,b) and X (5,0) is given as 9. So distance formula:

√[(5 - 0)^2 + (0 - b)^2] = √(25 + b²) = 9

Thus, 25 + b² = 81 → b² = 56 → b = √56 ≈ 7.483.

So coordinates:

Y: (0,0)

X: (5, 0)

Z: (0, √56)

Now, angle at Z. Let me find angle at Z, which is the angle between segments ZY and ZX.

Vector ZY goes from Z to Y: Y - Z = (0 - 0, 0 - √56) = (0, -√56)

Vector ZX goes from Z to X: X - Z = (5 - 0, 0 - √56) = (5, -√56)

To find angle between vectors ZY and ZX at point Z.

The formula for angle θ between vectors u and v is:

cosθ = (u · v)/(|u| |v|)

Compute the dot product:

u · v = (0)(5) + (-√56)(-√56) = 0 + (√56)^2 = 56

|u| is the magnitude of vector ZY: √(0² + (-√56)^2) = √(56) = √56

|v| is the magnitude of vector ZX: √(5² + (-√56)^2) = √(25 + 56) = √81 = 9

Therefore,

cosθ = 56 / (√56 * 9) = 56 / (9√56) 

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Note that 56 = 7*8 = 7*2^3, and √56 = 2√14. However, simplifying:

Divide numerator and denominator by √56:

cosθ = (56 / √56) / 9 = √56 / 9

Because 56 / √56 = √56 * √56 / √56 = √56

Wait, 56 divided by √56 equals √56. Because:

Multiply numerator and denominator by √56:

(56 * √56) / (√56 * √56) ) = (56√56)/56 = √56. Yes.

So cosθ = √56 / 9 ≈ 7.483 / 9 ≈ 0.8315

Wait, that's different from before. Wait, earlier when using sin or tan, I had angle ≈ 33.7°, but here, cos(theta) ≈ 0.8315. Let me check what angle has cosine ≈ 0.8315.

cos⁻¹(0.8315) is approximately?

Well, cos(33.7°) ≈ cos(33.7). Let me check:

cos(30°) ≈ 0.866, cos(35°) ≈ 0.8192. So 0.8315 is between 30° and 35°, closer to 33°.

Wait, but earlier calculations suggested angle was 33.7°, but this gives cos(theta) ≈ 0.8315. Let me check what's the actual value.

If cos(theta) ≈ 0.8315, then theta ≈ arccos(0.8315). Let me estimate.

Since cos(33.7°) ≈ ?

Let me use calculator-like approximation. Let me note that:

cos(33°) ≈ 0.8387

cos(34°) ≈ 0.8290

Our value is 0.8315, which is between cos(33°) and cos(34°). Let me find the exact value.

Let me denote theta such that cos(theta) = 0.8315. Let me compute the difference between cos(33°) and cos(34°):

At 33°, cos(theta) = 0.8387

At 34°, cos(theta) = 0.8290

The difference in cos values is 0.8387 - 0.8290 = 0.0097 over 1 degree.

Our target value is 0.8315, which is 0.8387 - 0.8315 = 0.0072 less than cos(33°). So fraction is 0.0072 / 0.0097 ≈ 0.742. Therefore, theta ≈ 33° + 0.742*(1°) ≈ 33.742°, which is approximately 33.7°, same as before! So angle is indeed approximately 33.7°, confirming previous results. Therefore, answer is B.

So why did I get confused earlier when thinking about the vectors? Because I thought the angle might be different, but actually, the angle computed via vectors is the same as angle Z, and it comes out to 33.7°, which matches our prior calculation. So everything checks out.

Therefore, the correct answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $ \angle Z $, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration described in the problem:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**

We are given three key pieces of information:

1. $ \text{Length}(ZX) = 9 $
2. $ \text{Length}(YX) = 5 $
3. Lines $ YX $ and $ YZ $ are **perpendicular**.

This implies that triangle $ XYZ $ is a **right triangle**, with the right angle at point $ Y $. Thus:

$$
\angle Y = 90^\circ
$$

From the Pythagorean Theorem applied to triangle $ XYZ $:

$$
(YX)^2 + (YZ)^2 = (ZX)^2 \\
5^2 + (YZ)^2 = 9^2 \\
25 + (YZ)^2 = 81 \\
(YZ)^2 = 56 \\
YZ = \sqrt{56} \approx 7.483
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine the Target Angle**

We are asked to find the measure of $ \angle Z $. In triangle $ XYZ $, this is one of the **acute angles** formed at vertex $ Z $, opposite side $ YX $ and adjacent to side $ YZ $.

Using **trigonometry**, specifically the **tangent function**, we can express:

$$
\tan(\angle Z) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{YX}{YZ} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{56}}
$$

Calculate the numerical value:

$$
\tan(\angle Z) = \frac{5}{\sqrt{56}} \approx \frac{5}{7.483} \approx 0.668
$$

---

### **Step 3: Compute the Angle**

Now, take the inverse tangent:

$$
\angle Z = \arctan(0.668)
$$

Using a scientific calculator or known values:

$$
\arctan(0.668) \approx 33.7^\circ
$$

This result aligns closely with standard trigonometric tables and interpolation techniques.

---

### **Conclusion**

After verifying through multiple approaches—using the tangent ratio, the law of sines, and coordinate geometry—we consistently arrive at the conclusion that:

$$
\angle Z \approx 33.7^\circ
$$

---

### **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{B}
$$
