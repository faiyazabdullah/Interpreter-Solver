MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to visualize the diagram based on the given constraints. Let me start by listing out all the information provided.

We have several angle measures given in terms of variables x and y:

1. Measure of Angle(D, Y, B) = 3x - 15
2. Measure of Angle(A, Y, G) = y + 25
3. Measure of Angle(G, B, E) = 105 degrees

Also, there are points lying on certain lines:

- Point Y lies on line AD.
- Point B lies on line YG.
- Point Y lies on line BH.
- Point B lies on lines EI and GH.
- Point Y lies on line GH.
- Lines AD and IE are parallel.

The goal is to find the value of y.

Hmm, since there are multiple lines and points mentioned, maybe it's helpful to sketch a rough diagram mentally. Let me think about how these points connect. 

Starting with point Y on line AD. So, points A, Y, D are colinear. Then, point B is on line YG. Also, point Y is on line BH. So, points B, Y, H are colinear? Wait, no: Point Y lies on line BH. So, points B, H, Y are colinear? Or Y is somewhere on BH. Similarly, point B is on line GH (so points G, B, H are colinear). And also, point B is on line EI. So, points E, I, B are colinear. Also, lines AD and IE are parallel.

Let me try to map out the connections:

- AD is a line with Y on it.
- YG is another line with B on it. So, starting from Y, going through G to B? Or maybe Y connected to G, and B is a point along that line. Since B is on YG, so Y---G---B or Y---B---G?

Also, Y lies on line BH. So, BH passes through Y. Therefore, points B, Y, H are colinear. But earlier, B is on line YG, which suggests that YG and BH intersect at B? Wait, no. If Y lies on BH, then BH is a line passing through Y. Also, B is on YG, meaning that YG passes through B. Therefore, lines YG and BH both pass through B and Y? Wait, if Y lies on BH, then BH is a line that goes through Y and B. Wait, but B is on YG. So, point B is on both YG and BH. Therefore, lines YG and BH meet at B. So, the lines YG and BH intersect at B, with Y being a point on both BH and YG? Wait, no. Let me clarify:

If Y lies on line BH, then BH is a line that includes Y and B. So, points B and Y are on BH. Also, B is on YG, which means that YG is a line that includes B. Therefore, YG connects Y to G, passing through B. So, the order would be Y---B---G? Or could be different depending on positions. Hmm, but without knowing exact positions, perhaps we can use angles and parallel lines.

Additionally, lines AD and IE are parallel. Since AD is a line with Y on it, and IE is parallel to AD. Also, point B is on EI (since B is on line EI). So, line EI is parallel to AD, and point B is on EI.

Given that, maybe there are some transversal lines creating corresponding angles or alternate interior angles because of the parallel lines.

Now, looking at angles:

Angle(D, Y, B): This is the angle at point Y between points D and B. So, ∠DYB. Similarly, Angle(A, Y, G) is ∠AYG. And Angle(G, B, E) is ∠GBE.

Since lines AD and IE are parallel, and EI is part of line EI. Maybe there are some relationships here. Also, considering the points connected via lines.

Let me try to consider possible triangles or transversals.

First, since AD || IE, and if there's a transversal cutting them, then corresponding angles would be equal. For example, if a line crosses AD and IE, then those angles would be congruent.

But how do these lines relate? Let me see. Points A, Y, D are colinear. So, AD is a straight line. Point Y is on AD. Then, line YG goes through B, and line BH goes through Y. Also, line EI is parallel to AD, and point B is on EI. So, line EI is parallel to AD, and point B is on EI. So, if we imagine line EI as parallel to AD, and since B is on EI, then perhaps triangle or something involving these lines.

Alternatively, since AD || IE, and if there's a transversal connecting them, like line YG or BH, maybe?

Wait, let me consider coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to points might help, but that could get complicated. Alternatively, using angle relationships.

Another approach: since AD || IE, and if there is a transversal that intersects both, then consecutive interior angles would be supplementary. Or same-side exterior angles... Wait, maybe if we can find some angles that are related due to the parallel lines.

Looking at the angles given: ∠DYB = 3x - 15, ∠AYG = y + 25, and ∠GBE = 105°. Need to relate these angles somehow.

Let me think about the location of each angle:

∠DYB is at Y, between D and B. Since D-Y-A are colinear (as Y is on AD), then DY is part of AD. So, DY is extending from D through Y to A. Then, angle at Y between D and B would involve line YB. So, ∠DYB is formed by lines YD and YB. Since YD is part of AD, which is parallel to IE. So, maybe line YB is a transversal?

Similarly, ∠AYG is at Y between A and G. Since AY is part of AD, and YG is another line. So, that angle is between AY and YG.

Also, ∠GBE is at point B between G and E. Since B is on YG and on EI (line EI). So, BE is part of EI, which is parallel to AD.

Maybe there's a way to find relationships between these angles using the parallel lines and transversals.

Let me consider the lines involved. Since AD || IE, and suppose line YB is a transversal. Because Y is on AD and B is on EI. Wait, since B is on EI, which is parallel to AD. So, line YB connects Y (on AD) to B (on EI). Thus, YB is a transversal crossing the two parallel lines AD and EI. Therefore, the angles formed by YB with AD and EI should have specific relations.

For instance, the angle between AD and YB at Y (which is ∠DYB) and the angle between EI and YB at B (which would be ∠EBY or something similar) would be supplementary if they are consecutive interior angles.

Wait, consecutive interior angles are supplementary when two parallel lines are cut by a transversal. So, if AD || IE, and YB is the transversal, then ∠DYB (at Y) and ∠EBY (at B) would be consecutive interior angles. Therefore, their sum should be 180 degrees.

So, ∠DYB + ∠EBY = 180°. 

But ∠DYB is given as 3x - 15. What is ∠EBY? Let's see. At point B, the angle between E and Y. Wait, ∠EBY is the angle at B between E and Y. However, we also know that ∠GBE is 105°, which is the angle at B between G and E. So, if we can relate ∠GBE and ∠EBY.

Assuming that lines YB and GB are connected. Since point B is on line YG, so Y-G-B are colinear? Wait, earlier we had that point B is on line YG. So, YG is a line passing through Y and G, with B on it. So, the order would be Y---B---G or Y---G---B? Depending on the direction. But since B is on YG, we can assume that YG is extended beyond G to B or beyond Y to B. Wait, but since Y is on line AD, and B is on line YG, which may or may not be connected to other points.

But regardless, at point B, we have lines BG and BE. Because ∠GBE is the angle at B between G and E. So, if we look at point B, connected to G and E. Also, since B is on EI, so line BE is part of EI. So, line BE is on EI, which is parallel to AD.

Therefore, if we consider line YB as a transversal crossing AD and EI, then ∠DYB and ∠EBY are consecutive interior angles, adding up to 180°. So:

∠DYB + ∠EBY = 180°  
=> (3x - 15) + ∠EBY = 180°  
But ∠EBY is adjacent to ∠GBE. Let me check the configuration.

At point B, we have lines BG (from B to G), BE (from B to E), and possibly others. The angle ∠GBE is between G and E, so it's the angle between BG and BE. Now, if we consider ∠EBY, which is the angle between EB and BY. Since BY is the same as YB. So, depending on the position of Y relative to B, ∠EBY and ∠GBE might form a linear pair or something else.

Wait, if B is on line YG, then line YB is the same as line YG extended? No, because YG is a line from Y to G, and B is a point on YG. So, if B is between Y and G, then YB is part of YG. If B is beyond G, then YB extends past G to B.

But regardless, at point B, the lines are BG (from B to G), BE (from B to E), and BY (from B to Y). So, the angle ∠GBE is between G and E, which is the angle between BG and BE. The angle ∠EBY is between E and Y, which is the angle between BE and BY. So, if we look at the angles around point B, ∠GBE and ∠EBY are adjacent angles forming a larger angle. Unless there's another line, but assuming that Y, B, and G are colinear, then the angle between BG and BY would be a straight line if Y is aligned with G and B. Wait, if B is on YG, then Y, B, G are colinear. So, line YG passes through B. Hence, line BY is the same as line BG extended? Wait, no. If B is between Y and G, then line YG passes through B, so BY is part of YG. In that case, angle between BG and BE is ∠GBE, and angle between BE and BY (which is BG extended) would be ∠EBY. So, ∠GBE + ∠EBY = 180°, if they are supplementary. Wait, because if you have a straight line BG (with B between Y and G), then BE is a ray from B making an angle with BG. So, ∠GBE and ∠EBY would add up to a straight angle if Y is in the opposite direction of G. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, since YB is a transversal crossing AD and EI, and we said that ∠DYB and ∠EBY are consecutive interior angles, adding to 180°. So, even if ∠EBY isn't directly visible, we can express it in terms of other angles.

But ∠GBE is given as 105°, which is the angle at B between G and E. If we can relate ∠EBY to ∠GBE, then maybe we can find equations.

Assume that at point B, the line BE forms an angle with BG (∠GBE = 105°) and with BY (∠EBY). If BY is part of line YG, then depending on the direction of YG, ∠EBY could be adjacent to ∠GBE. For instance, if Y is on the opposite side of BG relative to E, then ∠GBE and ∠EBY would be supplementary. Let me think:

Imagine line BG going from B to G. From point B, line BE goes off to E. Then, line BY goes from B towards Y. If Y is such that BY is in the opposite direction from BG, then the angle between BE and BY would be 180° minus ∠GBE. Wait, if Y is on the extension of BG beyond G, then BY would be in the same direction as BG. But if Y is on the other side, say, if Y is on the extension of BG beyond B, then BY would be in the direction opposite to BG. 

This seems too vague without a diagram. Perhaps I need another approach.

Alternatively, since AD || IE, and Y is on AD, while B is on EI. Then, line YB is a transversal. Therefore, the angles formed by YB with AD and EI are supplementary. As before, ∠DYB + ∠EBY = 180°. 

But ∠EBY is the angle at B between E and Y. Let me denote ∠EBY as z. So:

(3x - 15) + z = 180° => z = 180° - (3x - 15) = 195° - 3x.

But z is ∠EBY. How does this relate to ∠GBE?

At point B, we have lines BE, BG, and BY. Assuming that BY is a straight line (since B is on YG), then ∠GBE and ∠EBY are adjacent angles. Wait, if BY is a straight line from B to Y, then if BG is another line from B, then the angle between BG and BE is ∠GBE, and the angle between BE and BY is ∠EBY. So, unless there's another line, these two angles could form a linear pair if BY is in the opposite direction of BG. 

But if BY is in the opposite direction of BG, then ∠GBE + ∠EBY = 180°, because they are adjacent and form a straight line. Therefore, ∠GBE + ∠EBY = 180°, so:

105° + z = 180° => z = 75°.

Thus, z = 75°, which equals ∠EBY = 75°. Earlier, we had z = 195° - 3x. So:

195° - 3x = 75°  
=> 3x = 195° - 75° = 120°  
=> x = 40°.

So, x = 40. Now, we can use this to find other angles. But our target is to find y. So, we need to relate y to these values.

Looking back at the angles, we have ∠AYG = y + 25. Let me see if we can find that angle in terms of known quantities.

∠AYG is the angle at Y between A and G. Since Y is on AD, line AY is part of AD. So, ∠AYG is formed by lines YA and YG. Since YA is along AD, and YG is a line from Y to G. We might need to relate this angle with other angles.

Perhaps considering triangle AYG or using the fact that AD || IE.

Alternatively, since AD || IE, and line YG is a transversal. Wait, Y is on AD, and G is some point. Not sure yet. Alternatively, maybe considering vertical angles or other relationships.

Wait, if we consider the angles at point Y. Since Y is on AD and on BH. Also, line YG passes through B. Let me think about the angles around Y.

At point Y, we have:

- ∠DYB = 3x - 15 (given)
- ∠AYG = y + 25 (given)
- Also, since Y is on AD, and BH passes through Y, there might be more angles.

But maybe focusing on triangle YGB or something. Alternatively, since AD || IE, and if we can find some relationship involving ∠AYG.

Alternatively, since AD || IE, and if there's a transversal that creates corresponding angles. Suppose line YG is a transversal intersecting AD and IE. Wait, line YG starts at Y on AD and goes through B on EI. So, line YG is a transversal for AD and IE. Therefore, the angles formed by YG with AD and IE would have relationships.

Specifically, the angle between AD and YG at Y (∠AYG) and the angle between IE and YG at B would be corresponding angles, hence equal.

Wait, corresponding angles: when a transversal crosses two parallel lines, the corresponding angles are equal. Here, AD || IE, and line YG is the transversal. So, ∠AYG (at Y between A and G) corresponds to ∠IBE (at B between I and E)? Wait, not sure about the exact correspondence.

Wait, let me think again. When line YG crosses AD at Y and IE at B, then the corresponding angles would be:

- The angle between AD and YG at Y (∠AYG) corresponds to the angle between IE and YG at B. Which angle is that? At point B, line YG meets IE. The angle between IE and YG would be ∠IBY or something. Wait, since B is on IE, and line YG passes through B. So, at point B, the line IE is straight (since B is on IE), and YG is another line. So, the angle between IE and YG at B would be ∠YBE or ∠YBG? Wait, since IE is a line, and YG passes through B, so the angle between IE and YG at B is the angle between IB (or BE, since B is on IE) and YG. That angle would be ∠YBE.

Wait, if we consider the corresponding angles, ∠AYG (at Y) and ∠YBE (at B) should be equal because AD || IE and YG is the transversal. So:

∠AYG = ∠YBE.

From earlier, we found that ∠YBE (which is ∠EBY) was calculated as 75°, right? Wait, earlier we had ∠EBY = 75°, which is the angle at B between E and Y. So, that would be ∠YBE = 75°. Therefore:

∠AYG = 75°, since they are corresponding angles.

But ∠AYG is given as y + 25. Therefore:

y + 25 = 75  
=> y = 75 - 25 = 50.

So, y = 50. Looking at the answer choices, option B is 50. So, that would be the answer.

Let me verify my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, I considered the consecutive interior angles between AD and IE with transversal YB, leading to ∠DYB + ∠EBY = 180°. Then, I assumed that ∠GBE (105°) and ∠EBY (z) are supplementary because of the straight line, giving z = 75°. Then, using the corresponding angles from the parallel lines AD || IE with transversal YG, I set ∠AYG = ∠YBE = 75°, leading to y + 25 = 75 → y = 50.

That seems consistent. Let me check if there are any missing pieces.

Is there a possibility that ∠YBE is not the corresponding angle? Let me re-examine the corresponding angles.

AD || IE, and transversal YG. The corresponding angles would be:

- The angle on AD at Y (between AD and YG) corresponds to the angle on IE at B (between IE and YG).

Since AD is the line containing Y, and IE is the line containing B. The angle between AD and YG at Y is ∠AYG. The angle between IE and YG at B would be the angle between IE and YG, which is ∠YBE (since B is on IE). Therefore, yes, they are corresponding angles, so they are equal. Therefore, ∠AYG = ∠YBE = 75°, leading to y = 50. 

Yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the correct answer should be B. 50.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ y $, we examine the geometric relationships defined by the given constraints and apply key theorems of parallel lines and transversals.

---

### **Step 1: Understand Key Geometric Relationships**

We are told:

- $\angle D Y B = 3x - 15$
- $\angle A Y G = y + 25$
- $\angle G B E = 105^\circ$
- Line $AD \parallel$ line $IE$
- Point $Y$ lies on line $AD$, and point $B$ lies on line $EI$
- Line $YB$ acts as a transversal across parallel lines $AD$ and $IE$

---

### **Step 2: Use Consecutive Interior Angles**

Because $AD \parallel IE$, and line $YB$ is a transversal, the **consecutive interior angles** formed at the intersection points are supplementary:

$$
\angle D Y B + \angle E B Y = 180^\circ
$$

Substituting the expression for $\angle D Y B$:

$$
(3x - 15) + \angle E B Y = 180^\circ
$$

We isolate $\angle E B Y$:

$$
\angle E B Y = 180^\circ - (3x - 15) = 195^\circ - 3x
$$

---

### **Step 3: Analyze Triangle or Linear Pair at Point B**

At point $B$, we are given $\angle G B E = 105^\circ$. This angle is between segments $BG$ and $BE$. Since line $YB$ intersects at point $B$, and we’ve already established that $YB$ is a straight line (it lies on segment $YG$), then:

$$
\angle G B E + \angle E B Y = 180^\circ
$$

Substitute the known value:

$$
105^\circ + (195^\circ - 3x) = 180^\circ
$$

Simplify:

$$
300^\circ - 3x = 180^\circ \\
3x = 120^\circ \\
x = 40^\circ
$$

---

### **Step 4: Use Corresponding Angles Between Parallel Lines**

Now we consider the second transversal, line $YG$, which intersects the parallel lines $AD$ and $IE$. Specifically, the angle $\angle A Y G$ (at point $Y$) is **corresponding** to the angle $\angle Y B E$ (at point $B$):

$$
\angle A Y G = \angle Y B E
$$

We already determined that:

$$
\angle Y B E = 75^\circ
$$

So,

$$
\angle A Y G = 75^\circ
$$

But we’re also told that:

$$
\angle A Y G = y + 25
$$

Set these equal:

$$
y + 25 = 75
$$

Solve for $y$:

$$
y = 75 - 25 = 50
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\text{B}}
$$
