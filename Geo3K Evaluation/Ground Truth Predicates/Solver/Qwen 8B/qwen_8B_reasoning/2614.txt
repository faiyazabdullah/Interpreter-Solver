MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have triangle EFG that's equilateral. That means all sides are equal and all angles are 60 degrees each. The question mentions that EH bisects angle E. Also, there are some points mentioned like H lying on line GF. Let me try to visualize this first.

First, since triangle EFG is equilateral, each angle is 60 degrees. So angle at E, which is angle FEG, should be 60 degrees. Now, EH bisects angle E. Since it's an angle bisector, it splits the 60-degree angle into two equal parts. Therefore, each part would be 30 degrees. Wait, but maybe I need to check that again. If angle E is being bisected by EH, then angles FEH and HEF (assuming H is on FG) would each be half of 60°, so 30° each.

But wait, the problem also gives some other information about angles. Let me parse the given constraints:

- Measure of angle FHE is 15x. Wait, no, looking back: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(F, H, E)), 15x). So Angle at H between F and E? Wait, the notation Angle(F, H, E) refers to the angle at point H, formed by points F, H, E. So that's angle FHE. Similarly, Angle(G, E, H) is angle at E between G and H, which would be angle GEH. And Angle(H, E, F) is angle at E between H and F, which is angle HEF.

Wait, but since EH is the bisector of angle E, which is angle FEG. So angle FEH and angle HEF would each be 30 degrees. But according to the problem, measure of angle HEF is given as measure of angle 1, and measure of angle GEH is measure of angle 2. Wait, perhaps angle 1 and angle 2 refer to specific angles here?

Let me try to sketch this mentally. Points E, F, G form an equilateral triangle. Point H lies on line GF. So GF is one side of the triangle. Let me think: In triangle EFG, points F and G are vertices, and H is somewhere along FG. Then EH is drawn from E to H on FG, acting as the angle bisector of angle E.

Since EH is the angle bisector, splitting angle E into two 30-degree angles. So angle FEH = angle HEF = 30° each. However, the problem says that measure of angle HEF (which is angle at E between H and F) is equal to measure of angle 1. Also, measure of angle GEH (at E between G and H) is equal to measure of angle 2. Since angle E is split into two equal parts by EH, both angle 1 and angle 2 would be 30°, but that seems too straightforward. But maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, the problem states that angle FHE is 15x. Wait, Angle(F, H, E) is angle at H between F and E, so that's angle FHE. So angle FHE is given as 15x. Also, angle GEH is angle 2, and angle HEF is angle 1. Hmm. Maybe x is related to these angles?

Alternatively, maybe there's more to the diagram. Let me consider triangle EFG. Let me assign coordinates for clarity. Suppose E is at the top vertex. Let me imagine triangle EFG with EF=EG=FG because it's equilateral. Wait, no, in an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal. So EF=FG=GE. But if H is a point on FG, then depending on where H is located, different things happen.

But since EH is the angle bisector, by the angle bisector theorem, the ratio of FH to HG equals the ratio of EF to EG. But since EF=EG, that ratio is 1, meaning FH=HG. Therefore, H is the midpoint of FG. So H divides FG into two equal parts.

So, in triangle EFG, H is the midpoint of FG. Then, connecting E to H. So EH is the median, altitude, and angle bisector because in an equilateral triangle, all those lines coincide. Wait, but in an equilateral triangle, yes. So EH is perpendicular to FG? Wait, no, only if it's an equilateral triangle. Wait, in an equilateral triangle, the medians are also altitudes and angle bisectors. So EH would be perpendicular to FG. Therefore, angle FHE would be 90 degrees? Wait, but the problem says that angle FHE is 15x. So unless x is 6, making 15x=90. But that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Wait, but maybe the triangle isn't necessarily having H as the midpoint? Because the problem says that H lies on line GF, but does it specify where? The angle bisector theorem tells us that if EH is the angle bisector, then FH/HG = EF/EG. Since EF=EG, then FH=HG. Hence, H is the midpoint of FG. So that implies that FH=HG. So in that case, triangle EFG has H as the midpoint of FG, and EH is the median, angle bisector, and altitude.

Therefore, angle FHE is 90 degrees. But the problem says angle FHE is 15x. So 15x = 90 => x = 6. But how does that help us find angle 2?

Angle 2 is measure of angle GEH. Since EH is the angle bisector, angle GEH is half of angle E. Since angle E is 60 degrees, angle GEH is 30 degrees. Therefore, angle 2 is 30 degrees, which would correspond to option B. But let me verify again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the problem. It says that angle FHE is 15x, angle GEH is angle 2, angle HEF is angle 1. Since angle HEF is part of the angle bisector. Wait, angle HEF is angle at E between H and F, which is 30 degrees. So angle 1 is 30 degrees. But angle 2 is angle GEH, which is also 30 degrees. But why is angle FHE given as 15x? If angle FHE is 90 degrees, then x would be 6, but that may not be necessary for solving angle 2.

Wait, perhaps there is another way. Maybe triangle FHE is not right-angled? Wait, if H is the midpoint of FG in an equilateral triangle, then EH is the altitude, so yes, it would be perpendicular. Therefore, angle FHE is 90 degrees. So 15x = 90 ⇒ x = 6. But maybe there's more to the problem. Wait, but the question asks for measure of angle 2, which is angle GEH. Which is 30 degrees, hence answer B. But let me make sure.

Alternatively, maybe the diagram is different. For example, suppose that H is not the midpoint. Wait, but according to the angle bisector theorem, if EH is the angle bisector of angle E, then FH / HG = EF / EG. Since EF = EG in an equilateral triangle, then FH = HG, so H is the midpoint. Thus, angle FHE is 90 degrees. So angle FHE = 15x → x = 6. But angle 2 is angle GEH, which is half of angle E, so 30 degrees. Therefore, answer is B.

But let me check again. Let me think of triangle EFG with H on FG such that EH bisects angle E. Then, since triangle EFG is equilateral, angle at E is 60 degrees. So angle FEH = angle HEF = 30 degrees. Therefore, angle GEH is angle between GE and EH, which is angle GEH. Since angle FEG is 60 degrees, and angle FEH is 30 degrees, then angle GEH is also 30 degrees. Therefore, angle 2 is 30 degrees. So answer is B. 

But wait, the problem mentions angle FHE is 15x. If angle FHE is 90 degrees, then x=6. But maybe there is another relation? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the angle notation. Let me confirm the notation again.

The notation Angle(F, H, E) refers to the angle at point H between points F and E. So that's ∠FHE. So in triangle FHE, angle at H is ∠FHE. If H is the midpoint of FG in an equilateral triangle, then EH is the altitude, so triangle EHF is a right triangle with right angle at H. Therefore, ∠FHE = 90°, so 15x = 90° ⇒ x = 6. But this seems okay. However, the problem doesn't ask for x; it asks for measure of angle 2, which is ∠GEH = 30°, so answer B. 

Is there a possibility that angle 2 is referring to another angle? Let me check again. The problem says: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(G, E, H)), MeasureOf(angle 2)). So Angle(G, E, H) is the angle at E between G and H. So that's ∠GEH. So that's the same as angle 2, which is 30 degrees. So answer B. 

Therefore, the correct answer should be B. 30 degrees.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine $ m\angle 2 $, we start by analyzing the given geometric configuration involving triangle $ \triangle EFG $, which is explicitly stated to be **equilateral**. This means:

- All sides are equal: $ EF = FG = GE $
- All internal angles are equal: Each angle measures $ 60^\circ $

Additionally, it is given that **point $ H $ lies on segment $ FG $** and that **$ EH $ bisects $ \angle E $**. This means that $ EH $ is the **angle bisector** of $ \angle FEG $, dividing it into two equal parts.

---

### Step 1: Analyze the Angle Bisector

Since $ \triangle EFG $ is equilateral, we know:
$$
\angle FEG = 60^\circ
$$
Because $ EH $ bisects this angle, it splits it into two equal halves:
$$
\angle FEH = \angle HEF = \frac{60^\circ}{2} = 30^\circ
$$

This tells us that:
- $ \angle HEF = 30^\circ $
- $ \angle GEH = 30^\circ $

From the problem statement, $ \angle GEH $ is defined as **measure of angle 2**, so:
$$
m\angle 2 = 30^\circ
$$

---

### Step 2: Confirming the Configuration via Triangle Geometry

We're also told that:
- $ \angle FHE = 15x $
  
Since $ H $ lies on $ FG $, and $ EH $ bisects $ \angle E $, we can infer that $ H $ is the **midpoint of segment $ FG $** due to the symmetry of the equilateral triangle and the fact that the angle bisector in an equilateral triangle is also the median and altitude. Thus, $ EH $ is perpendicular to $ FG $, forming a right angle at $ H $. Therefore:
$$
\angle FHE = 90^\circ
$$
Setting this equal to the given expression:
$$
15x = 90^\circ \Rightarrow x = 6
$$

While this confirms the value of $ x $, it is **not needed** to compute $ m\angle 2 $, which we've already determined through the angle bisector property.

---

### Final Conclusion

The measure of $ \angle GEH $, which corresponds to **angle 2**, is:
$$
\boxed{30}
$$

---

**Final Answer:** B
