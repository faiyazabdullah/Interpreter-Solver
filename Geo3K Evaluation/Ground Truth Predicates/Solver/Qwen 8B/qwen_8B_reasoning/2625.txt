MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have quadrilateral DEFG which is a rectangle. The question gives us two angle measures: m∠EFD is 2x - 3 and m∠DFG is x + 12. We need to find the measure of ∠EFD.

First, since it's a rectangle, I remember that all angles in a rectangle are right angles, meaning they're 90 degrees each. Wait, but hold on—the problem mentions specific angles here, so maybe there's something else going on? Let me check the constraints again.

The problem states that point A lies on line EG and also on line DF. Also, lines DG and GF are perpendicular. Hmm, maybe those points are part of some triangle or something? But the main focus is on quadrilateral DEFG being a rectangle. Let me visualize this rectangle. Let me sketch mentally: points D, E, F, G forming a rectangle. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and parallel, and all angles are 90 degrees. 

But then why are they giving specific angles? Maybe the angles mentioned aren't the usual 90-degree angles? Wait, no—if DEFG is a rectangle, then each angle should be 90 degrees. However, the problem gives expressions for two angles, which suggests that perhaps these angles are not the internal angles of the rectangle? Or maybe there's a misinterpretation here?

Wait, let me re-read the problem. It says Quadrilateral DEFG is a rectangle. Then, m∠EFD = 2x - 3 and m∠DFG = x + 12. Find m∠EFD.

So, ∠EFD and ∠DFG—those are angles at different vertices. Let me think about how these angles relate in the rectangle.

Let me label the rectangle properly. Let's assume the rectangle has vertices D, E, F, G in order. So, the sides would be DE, EF, FG, GD. Therefore, the angles at each vertex are between adjacent sides.

So, ∠EFD is the angle at point F, between points E, F, D. Wait, but in a rectangle, each angle is 90 degrees. So, if that's the case, then both angles given should be 90 degrees. But the problem gives them as expressions involving x. That seems contradictory unless... Wait, perhaps the diagram isn't standard? Or maybe the labels are different?

Alternatively, maybe the angles mentioned are not the internal angles of the rectangle. For example, maybe ∠EFD is an angle formed by extending some lines or considering diagonals?

Wait, the problem also mentions some geometric constraints: Point A lies on lines EG and DF. Also, lines DG and GF are perpendicular. Let me parse that. So, DG and GF are perpendicular. Since DG is a side of the rectangle? Wait, DG would be one of the sides. If DEFG is a rectangle, then DG is a diagonal? Because in a rectangle, the diagonals are congruent and bisect each other. Wait, but DG connects D to G. Let me think.

If DEFG is a rectangle, then the sides are DE, EF, FG, GD. So, DG would be a diagonal connecting D to G. Similarly, GF is a side. Wait, GF is part of the rectangle. If DG and GF are perpendicular, then that implies that the diagonal DG is perpendicular to the side GF. But in a rectangle, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, but if DG is perpendicular to GF, then that would mean that the diagonal DG is perpendicular to the side GF. But in a rectangle, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Therefore, this might imply that the rectangle is actually a square? But maybe not necessarily. Wait, but the problem says it's a rectangle, so maybe there's more to it.

Alternatively, maybe my assumption about the labeling of the rectangle is incorrect. Let me consider another possibility. Suppose the rectangle is labeled such that D, E, F, G are arranged differently. For instance, maybe it's D connected to E connected to F connected to G connected back to D. So, DE, EF, FG, GD are sides. Then, DG would be a diagonal. So, if DG is perpendicular to GF, then that would mean that the diagonal DG is perpendicular to the side GF. Which would only happen if the rectangle is a square, because otherwise, the diagonals are not perpendicular to the sides.

Wait, but in a rectangle, the diagonals are congruent and bisect each other, but they aren't perpendicular unless it's a square. So, if DG (a diagonal) is perpendicular to GF (a side), then that would require that the rectangle is a square. But the problem just says it's a rectangle, not necessarily a square. Therefore, there must be something wrong with my assumptions.

Alternatively, maybe DG is not a diagonal. Let me check the labeling again. If DEFG is a rectangle, then moving around the rectangle, the order of the letters matters. Let me think of coordinates to model this. Let me assign coordinates to make it easier.

Suppose point D is at (0, 0). Since it's a rectangle, let me define the coordinates:

- Let’s say D is at (0, 0).
- Since it's a rectangle, suppose E is at (a, 0) for some a > 0.
- Then F would be at (a, b) for some b > 0.
- And G would be at (0, b).

Then, the sides are DE from (0,0) to (a,0); EF from (a,0) to (a,b); FG from (a,b) to (0,b); and GD from (0,b) to (0,0). Wait, no—that would make FG go from (a,b) to (0,b)? No, that would make FG go leftward. Wait, maybe my labeling is off. Alternatively, maybe the order is D-E-F-G-D. So starting at D(0,0), then E(a,0), then F(a,b), then G(0,b), then back to D. So, yes, that makes a rectangle.

Now, DG would be the segment from D(0,0) to G(0,b). Wait, that's vertical. GF is from G(0,b) to F(a,b). So GF is horizontal. Therefore, DG is vertical, GF is horizontal, so they are perpendicular. Oh! So DG is vertical, GF is horizontal, so they are indeed perpendicular. Therefore, the condition Perpendicular(Line(D,G), Line(G,F)) is satisfied automatically in a rectangle. So that's consistent.

Therefore, in this coordinate system, DG is vertical, GF is horizontal. So, the given constraint is naturally satisfied in a rectangle. Therefore, the problem is consistent.

Now, returning to the angles given: ∠EFD and ∠DFG.

Let me find those angles in terms of coordinates.

First, ∠EFD is the angle at point F, between points E, F, D. So, looking at point F(a,b). The segments FE and FD form this angle. FE goes from F(a,b) to E(a,0), which is straight down along the vertical line x=a. FD goes from F(a,b) to D(0,0). So, vector FD is from F(a,b) to D(0,0): (-a, -b). Vector FE is from F(a,b) to E(a,0): (0, -b).

So, angle between FD and FE at point F. To compute this angle, maybe using vectors or slopes.

Alternatively, since we know coordinates, we can calculate the angle. Let me think.

Alternatively, since DEFG is a rectangle, the angle at F is 90 degrees. Wait, but according to the problem, ∠EFD is given as 2x - 3. But in reality, that angle should be 90 degrees. So, maybe there's a misunderstanding here.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify: In the rectangle, the internal angles are all 90 degrees. So, ∠EFD is supposed to be 90 degrees. But the problem says it's 2x - 3. Therefore, setting 2x - 3 = 90, solving for x gives x = (90 + 3)/2 = 93/2 = 46.5. Then, substituting into m∠DFG = x + 12, that would be 46.5 + 12 = 58.5. But none of the answer choices match these values. Therefore, my initial assumption must be wrong.

This contradiction suggests that my interpretation of the angle ∠EFD is incorrect. Perhaps ∠EFD is not the internal angle of the rectangle? Let me reconsider the notation.

In angle notation, ∠EFD means the angle at point F, with segments FE and FD. So, that's the same as before. But in the rectangle, that angle should be 90 degrees. So why does the problem give it as 2x - 3? There must be another configuration.

Wait, maybe the quadrilateral is not convex? Or maybe the points are labeled differently? Let me try to think of another way to label the rectangle.

Alternative labeling: Suppose the rectangle is D-E-G-F instead of D-E-F-G? Wait, but the problem says quadrilateral D E F G. So, the order is important. Let me think again.

Another approach: Maybe the diagram isn't a rectangle, but the problem says it is. Wait, the problem says "Quadrilateral D E F G is a rectangle." So, regardless of labeling, it's a rectangle. Therefore, each internal angle is 90 degrees. Hence, ∠EFD must be 90 degrees. So, why is it given as 2x - 3? This suggests that either there's a mistake in the problem, or my understanding of the angle is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the angle is not the internal angle? For example, if there's a triangle involved. Let me recall the given constraints: Point A lies on line EG and on line DF. Also, DG is perpendicular to GF. So, maybe point A is somewhere inside the rectangle? Let me try to imagine that.

Since DG is perpendicular to GF, which we already saw in the rectangle setup. Now, point A lies on both EG and DF. So, EG is the line from E to G. In our coordinate system, E is (a,0), G is (0,b). So, line EG goes from (a,0) to (0,b). Line DF goes from D(0,0) to F(a,b). These two lines intersect at point A. Let me find coordinates of A.

Parametrize line EG: Starting at E(a,0) going towards G(0,b). Parametric equations: x = a - a*t, y = 0 + b*t, where t ∈ [0,1].

Parametrize line DF: From D(0,0) to F(a,b). Parametric equations: x = a*s, y = b*s, s ∈ [0,1].

Find intersection point A. Set equations equal:

For x-coordinate: a - a*t = a*s ⇒ 1 - t = s.

For y-coordinate: b*t = b*s ⇒ t = s.

From the first equation, s = 1 - t. Substitute into second equation: t = 1 - t ⇒ 2t = 1 ⇒ t = 1/2. Therefore, s = 1/2. Thus, point A is at (a*(1/2), b*(1/2)) = (a/2, b/2). So, point A is the midpoint of both EG and DF, which makes sense because in a rectangle, the diagonals bisect each other.

But how does this help with the angles?

Maybe the angles mentioned (∠EFD and ∠DFG) are related to triangles formed by point A? Or maybe there's some triangle where these angles are located?

Wait, let me look at ∠DFG. That's the angle at point F between points D, F, G. Wait, in the rectangle, point D is connected to F via diagonal DF? Or is DF a side?

Wait, in the rectangle DEFG, the sides are DE, EF, FG, GD. So, DF is a diagonal. So, ∠DFG is the angle at point F between points D, F, G. So, that would be the angle between FD and FG. In the rectangle, FD is the diagonal from F to D, and FG is the side from F to G. So, let's think about that angle.

In our coordinate system, point F is (a,b). FG goes from F(a,b) to G(0,b), which is leftwards along horizontal line y=b. FD goes from F(a,b) to D(0,0), which is the diagonal. So, the angle between FD and FG at point F.

Similarly, ∠EFD is the angle at F between E, F, D. So, FE is from F(a,b) to E(a,0), which is downward vertical, and FD is from F(a,b) to D(0,0), which is diagonal.

So, these are two different angles at point F. Let me try to compute their measures.

First, let's compute ∠DFG. At point F, between D, F, G. So, FD is the diagonal from F to D, and FG is the side from F to G. So, the angle between FD and FG.

To find this angle, maybe use vectors. Vector FD is D - F = (0 - a, 0 - b) = (-a, -b). Vector FG is G - F = (0 - a, b - b) = (-a, 0).

So, the angle between vectors FD (-a, -b) and FG (-a, 0). The formula for the angle θ between vectors u and v is cosθ = (u · v)/(|u||v|).

Compute the dot product:

(-a)(-a) + (-b)(0) = a² + 0 = a².

|FD| = sqrt(a² + b²)

|FG| = sqrt((-a)^2 + 0^2) = sqrt(a²) = a.

Thus, cosθ = a² / [sqrt(a² + b²)*a] ] = a / sqrt(a² + b²).

Therefore, θ = arccos(a / sqrt(a² + b²)). 

Similarly, ∠EFD is the angle at F between E, F, D. So, vectors FE and FD.

Vector FE is E - F = (a - a, 0 - b) = (0, -b).

Vector FD is D - F = (-a, -b).

Dot product of FE and FD: (0)(-a) + (-b)(-b) = b².

|FE| = sqrt(0² + (-b)^2) = b.

|FD| = sqrt(a² + b²).

Thus, cosφ = b² / [b * sqrt(a² + b²)] = b / sqrt(a² + b²).

So φ = arccos(b / sqrt(a² + b²)).

Now, note that θ and φ are complementary angles because tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent = b/a, while tan(phi) = a/b. Wait, but theta is the angle between FD and FG, which we found earlier, and phi is the angle between FE and FD. Let me see.

Alternatively, since in the rectangle, the diagonal FD splits the angle at F into two parts. Wait, but in a rectangle, each internal angle is 90 degrees. So, the angle between FE and FG is 90 degrees. But FD is splitting that angle into two parts: ∠DFG (theta) and ∠EFD (phi). Therefore, theta + phi = 90 degrees.

Yes! Because at point F, the original angle between FE and FG is 90 degrees (since it's a rectangle), and FD splits that angle into two parts: theta (∠DFG) and phi (∠EFD). Therefore, theta + phi = 90°.

So, we have:

m∠DFG + m∠EFD = 90°.

Given that:

m∠EFD = 2x - 3,

and

m∠DFG = x + 12.

Therefore:

(2x - 3) + (x + 12) = 90°.

Combine like terms:

3x + 9 = 90.

Subtract 9 from both sides:

3x = 81.

Divide by 3:

x = 27.

Then, substitute x = 27 into m∠EFD = 2x - 3:

2*27 - 3 = 54 - 3 = 51°.

Looking at the answer choices, option A is 51. So, the answer should be A.

But let me double-check my reasoning. The key was realizing that the two angles at point F add up to 90 degrees because they are parts of the right angle at F in the rectangle. Initially, I thought the angles were internal angles of the rectangle, but they are actually parts of the right angle split by the diagonal FD. That explains why they sum to 90°, allowing us to set up the equation and solve for x.

Therefore, the measure of ∠EFD is 51°, corresponding to answer choice A.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine $ m\angle EFD $, we begin by analyzing the geometric structure of the quadrilateral $ DEFG $, which is explicitly stated to be a **rectangle**. In a rectangle, **all interior angles are right angles**, i.e., $ 90^\circ $. However, the problem introduces two specific angles—$ \angle EFD $ and $ \angle DFG $—which appear to be **subangles** formed by a diagonal within the rectangle.

### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry

We denote the vertices of the rectangle in order as $ D $, $ E $, $ F $, and $ G $. In a rectangle, consecutive sides are perpendicular, and the diagonals bisect each other. Importantly, when a diagonal divides an angle at a vertex, it creates **two subangles** whose sum equals the original angle.

At vertex $ F $, the angle formed by sides $ FE $ and $ FG $ is a right angle (as it is a corner of the rectangle). The diagonal $ DF $ splits this right angle into two smaller angles:

$$
\angle EFD \text{ and } \angle DFG
$$

These two subangles thus satisfy the relationship:

$$
\angle EFD + \angle DFG = 90^\circ
$$

---

### Step 2: Substituting Given Expressions

From the problem, we are given:

- $ m\angle EFD = 2x - 3 $
- $ m\angle DFG = x + 12 $

Using the relationship above:

$$
(2x - 3) + (x + 12) = 90
$$

$$
3x + 9 = 90
$$

$$
3x = 81 \Rightarrow x = 27
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculating $ m\angle EFD $

Now, substitute $ x = 27 $ into the expression for $ m\angle EFD $:

$$
m\angle EFD = 2x - 3 = 2(27) - 3 = 54 - 3 = 51^\circ
$$

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{\text{A}}
$$
