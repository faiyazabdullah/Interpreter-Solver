MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. Hmm, so we need to find the measure of angle 1, which is denoted as ∠GBD. The given information includes several angles and some perpendicular lines. Let me start by listing out all the given constraints to make sense of them.

First, they mention that the measure of angle CBF is 37 degrees. So, ∠CBF = 37°. Then, it says that the measure of angle ABG equals the measure of angle 2. Wait, angle 2 isn't defined yet. But maybe angle 2 refers to another angle in the diagram? Similarly, angle GBD (which is angle 1) is equal to angle 1. Also, there are points lying on certain lines: point B lies on lines AC, DE, and FG. Additionally, line BD is perpendicular to line BC. 

Let me visualize this. Since point B is on lines AC, DE, and FG, that suggests that these lines all pass through point B. So, line AC passes through B, meaning B is somewhere along AC. Similarly, DE and FG also pass through B. Also, BD is perpendicular to BC. That means that at point B, lines BD and BC form a right angle (90°). 

So, considering that BD is perpendicular to BC, then triangle BCD might be a right triangle? Or maybe triangle BDC? Wait, since BD is perpendicular to BC, then angle CBD is 90°. Wait, but angle CBD would be part of angle ABC? Maybe I need to draw a rough sketch mentally. Let me think about how these points are arranged.

Points A, B, C are colinear because B lies on line AC. Points D and E are connected via line DE, with B on that line. Similarly, points F and G are connected via line FG, with B on that line. So, B is the intersection point of lines AC, DE, and FG. Also, BD is perpendicular to BC. So, BD is a line starting at B and going towards D, forming a right angle with BC. 

Now, looking at the angles mentioned. Angle CBF is 37°, which is the angle between CB and BF. Since B is on line FG, then BF is part of line FG. So, angle CBF is formed by lines CB and BF. Also, angle ABG is equal to angle 2. Since B is on line FG, BG is part of line FG as well. Therefore, angle ABG is the angle between BA and BG. 

Wait, perhaps there are multiple angles around point B? Let me consider the different lines passing through B:

- Line AC: points A-B-C
- Line DE: points D-B-E
- Line FG: points F-B-G

Also, BD is perpendicular to BC. So, BD forms a right angle with BC. Let me note that BD ⊥ BC implies that angle between BD and BC is 90°, so ∠CBD = 90°. 

Since BD is perpendicular to BC, then line BD is like a vertical line if BC is horizontal, for example. Now, angle CBF is given as 37°, which is part of the lines CB and BF. Since BF is on line FG, which passes through B. So, BF is a segment from B to F, and BG is another segment from B to G, which is on the same line FG. Therefore, angles involving BF and BG could be adjacent?

But angle ABG is equal to angle 2. Let me think about angle ABG. Since B is on line AC, BA is part of line AC. So, BA goes from B to A, and BG goes from B to G. Therefore, angle ABG is the angle between BA and BG. 

Hmm. Let me try to mark all these angles. Starting with angle CBF = 37°, which is between CB and BF. Since BD is perpendicular to BC, then BD forms a right angle with BC. So, if I imagine BC going horizontally to the right, BD would go upward vertically from B. Then, BF is some line from B making a 37° angle with BC. Depending on the direction of BF, it could be above or below BD. But since BD is perpendicular, maybe BF is in a specific position relative to BD.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the sum of angles around point B should add up appropriately. Let me consider the angles around point B. Since lines AC, DE, and FG all pass through B, there are several angles formed at B.

For instance, angles around point B include:

- Between BA and BC (since A-B-C are colinear): that's a straight line, so 180°, but split into two parts by other lines.

Wait, but BA and BC are in opposite directions since B is between A and C. So, angle ABC is actually a straight angle, 180°, but when considering other lines through B, such as BD, BF, BG, etc., those create various angles.

Let me focus on the angles related to BD being perpendicular to BC. So, BD is perpendicular to BC, so angle between BD and BC is 90°, which is ∠CBD = 90°. Therefore, if I look at line BD, which is perpendicular to BC, then BD splits the plane into two parts. 

Now, angle CBF is 37°, which is between CB and BF. Since BD is perpendicular to CB, then BF could be either on one side of BD or the other. Suppose that BF is on the same side as BD. Let me assume that BD is upwards from B, and BF is forming a 37° angle with CB. If BD is perpendicular to CB, then the direction of BF would depend on whether it's on the same side as BD or not. 

But maybe we can find relationships between the angles. For example, since BD is perpendicular to BC, then angle between BD and BC is 90°, so if we have angle CBF = 37°, then depending on where F is located, perhaps angle between BF and BD can be determined. 

Alternatively, maybe using triangle properties. Let me see. If we consider triangle BCF, but without knowing more sides, it's hard to say. However, maybe focusing on angles around point B. 

At point B, there are several lines: BA, BC, BD, BF, BG. Since BA and BC are in a straight line (as A-B-C), then angles on one side of BC would be supplementary. 

But since BD is perpendicular to BC, then BD creates a 90° angle with BC. Let me think about the angles created by BF. If angle CBF is 37°, then that would mean that BF is creating a 37° angle with BC. Depending on the direction of BF, this could be inside or outside the right angle formed by BD and BC. 

Suppose that BD is going upwards from B, perpendicular to BC. If angle CBF is measured from CB towards BF, then BF could be on the same side as BD or on the opposite side. Let me try to imagine that. If BF is on the same side as BD (i.e., upwards), then angle between BF and BD would be 90° - 37° = 53°, assuming that BF is between BC and BD. Alternatively, if BF is on the other side, then it might be 37° + 90°, but that seems larger than 180°, which isn't possible. 

Wait, but angles around a point sum up to 360°, but here we're dealing with angles on one side of BC. Let me clarify. Since BA and BC are in a straight line, the angles on one side of BC (say, the upper half-plane) would include angles like ∠ABG, ∠ABD, ∠CBD, and others. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of linear pairs. Since BA and BC are a straight line, then angles adjacent to them would form linear pairs. For example, if there's a line BD perpendicular to BC, then BD divides the plane into two regions. 

Let me try to assign variables to unknown angles. Let me denote angle 1 as ∠GBD, which is given to be equal to angle 1. Also, angle ABG is equal to angle 2. Wait, the question asks for m∠1, which is ∠GBD. So, angle 1 is ∠GBD. 

We know that ∠CBF = 37°. Let me consider the line FG passing through B. Since F and G are on line FG, then BF and BG are segments from B to F and B to G respectively. So, angle ABG is the angle between BA and BG. Since BA is part of line AC, which extends through B to C. 

If I can express ∠ABG in terms of known angles or relate it to other angles, that might help. Also, since BD is perpendicular to BC, then maybe there's a relationship between ∠ABG and ∠GBD. 

Wait, let's consider the entire setup again. At point B, we have several lines:

- Line AC: BA and BC
- Line DE: BD and BE
- Line FG: BF and BG

Additionally, BD is perpendicular to BC. 

So, if I consider the angles around point B:

Starting with line BC, which has BA extending backwards (since A-B-C). BD is perpendicular to BC, so BD makes a 90° angle with BC. Then, line FG passes through B, with BF and BG on that line. 

Assuming that the order of points on line FG is F-B-G, then BF is one direction from B, and BG is the opposite. Therefore, angle between BF and BG would be a straight line, 180°, but since they are on the same line. 

Now, angle CBF is the angle between CB and BF. Since CB is going from C to B, and BF is going from B to F. So, if I imagine standing at point B, facing away from C (towards A), then turning towards F would give me the angle between CB and BF. 

Given that BD is perpendicular to BC, then if I imagine rotating from BC towards BD, that's 90°, and then further towards BF. If angle CBF is 37°, then the direction of BF is 37° from CB. 

So, suppose that BD is perpendicular to BC, which is 90°, then if BF is forming a 37° angle with CB, then depending on which side of BD it's on, the angle between BF and BD would be |90° - 37°| = 53°, or 90° + 37°, but that would exceed 180°, so probably not. 

Therefore, if BF is on the same side as BD, then the angle between BF and BD is 90° - 37° = 53°. 

Now, what about angle GBG? Wait, no. Let me think about angle ABG. Since BG is on line FG, which passes through B, and BA is on line AC. So, angle ABG is between BA and BG. If I can find this angle, it's equal to angle 2. 

But how does this relate to other angles? Let me think about the angles around point B. 

The total angles around point B should add up to 360°, but since we have multiple lines intersecting at B, each pair of lines creates angles. However, since some of these lines are collinear, like BA and BC, which form a straight line. 

Let me attempt to break down the angles. 

First, since BA and BC are a straight line, the angles on one side of that line (say, the upper half-plane) will add up to 180°, and similarly for the lower half-plane. 

But BD is perpendicular to BC, so BD splits the upper half-plane into two angles: one between BC and BD (which is 90°), and the other between BD and the extension of BA. Wait, no. Let me clarify. 

If BA and BC are a straight line, then at point B, the line BC goes from B to C, and BA goes from B to A in the opposite direction. If BD is perpendicular to BC, then BD is going off at a right angle from BC. So, if BC is pointing to the right, BD would go upward or downward. Let's assume upward for simplicity. 

Then, the upper half-plane at point B contains BD and possibly other lines like BF and BG. 

Angle CBF is 37°, which is between CB (rightward) and BF. If BF is above BC (same side as BD), then angle between CB and BF is 37°, so BF is 37° above BC. Since BD is 90° above BC, then the angle between BF and BD would be 90° - 37° = 53°, as previously thought. 

Similarly, BG is on the same line FG as BF. Assuming that F and G are on opposite sides of B on line FG, then BG would be in the opposite direction from BF. So, if BF is going upwards from B at 37° from BC, then BG would be going downwards from B along FG. 

Therefore, angle ABG would be the angle between BA (which is opposite to BC) and BG. Let me visualize this. BA is going left from B (if BC is right), and BG is going downward from B (assuming FG is a line passing through B with F above and G below). 

So, angle ABG would be the angle between BA (left) and BG (downward). To calculate this, we can consider the direction of BG relative to BA. 

Since BG is on line FG, which passes through B, and BF is part of FG. If BF is at 37° above BC (to the right), then FG is a line that goes from F (above BC) through B to G (below BC). So, BG is going downward from B. 

Thus, angle ABG is the angle between BA (left) and BG (downward). This would be equivalent to 180° minus the angle between BA and the downward direction. Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of coordinates. 

Imagine coordinate system with point B at origin. Let’s set coordinates for clarity. Let me place point B at (0,0). Let’s take BC along positive x-axis, so point C is at (c, 0) for some c > 0. Since BD is perpendicular to BC, BD is along positive y-axis (upwards). 

Then, line FG passes through B, with BF making a 37° angle with BC (x-axis). So, BF is in the direction of 37° above x-axis. Therefore, the slope of BF is tan(37°). 

But line FG continues past B to G, so BG is in the opposite direction of BF. So, if BF is at +37° from x-axis, then BG is at -37° from x-axis (since it's on the same line FG, but on the opposite side of B). 

Therefore, the direction of BG is 180° - 37° = 143° from positive x-axis? Wait, no. If BF is at +37°, then the line FG extends through B, so from B, going in the direction opposite to BF. So, if BF is going up at +37°, then BG would be going in the direction of -37° (i.e., symmetrically below the x-axis). 

So, vectorially, BG is at an angle of 180° - 37° = 143° from positive x-axis? No, wait. If you're on line FG, going from F through B to G, then from point B, the direction from B to G is the opposite of direction from B to F. So, if BF is at +37° from x-axis (direction towards F), then BG is at -37° from x-axis (direction towards G). 

Therefore, the angle between BA (which is along negative x-axis, since BA is opposite to BC) and BG (which is at -37° from x-axis) can be calculated. 

BA is along negative x-axis (from B to A). BG is at -37° from x-axis. So, the angle between BA (negative x-axis) and BG (at -37°) is the difference between their directions. 

Negative x-axis is 180°, and BG is at -37°, which is equivalent to 360° - 37° = 323°. The angle between 180° and 323° is 323° - 180° = 143°, but since angles are typically measured as the smallest angle between two lines, that would be 180° - 143° = 37°? Wait, no. Wait, if BA is along negative x-axis (180°), and BG is at -37° (or 323°), then the angle between BA and BG is the absolute difference between 180° and 323°, which is 143°, but that's more than 180°, so the smaller angle is 360° - 143° = 217°, which is still more than 180°. Wait, something's wrong here. 

Actually, the angle between two vectors can be found by taking the minimum between the clockwise and counterclockwise angles. Let me think differently. 

If BA is pointing directly to the left (along negative x-axis), and BG is pointing at -37° from x-axis (which is 37° below the x-axis), then the angle between BA (left) and BG (southeast direction) can be calculated as follows: 

From BA (left) to BG (downward), you turn clockwise from left (180°) to downward (which is 270° if we go counterclockwise, but in standard position, downward is 270°, but BG is at -37°, which is equivalent to 323°. 

Alternatively, imagine standing at point B, facing left (BA), then turning towards BG. The angle between BA (left) and BG (which is 37° below x-axis) would be 90° (from left to down) plus 37°? Wait, no. If you face left (BA), then turning towards BG, which is below the x-axis. From left (180°), turning clockwise towards the downward direction (which is 270°), the angle between BA and BG is 270° - 180° = 90°, but since BG is only at -37°, which is 37° below x-axis, so from BA (left) to BG (which is 37° below x-axis), the angle is 90° - 37° = 53°? Wait, that might be. 

Wait, let's use coordinate system. Let me represent BA as vector (-1, 0) and BG as vector (cos(-37°), sin(-37°)) = (cos(37°), -sin(37°)). The angle between BA and BG is the angle between (-1, 0) and (cos(37°), -sin(37°)). 

Using the dot product formula: cosθ = (v · w)/(|v||w|)

v = (-1, 0), w = (cos(37°), -sin(37°))

Dot product v · w = (-1)(cos37°) + 0*(-sin37°) = -cos37°

|v| = sqrt((-1)^2 + 0^2) = 1

|w| = sqrt(cos²37° + sin²37°) = 1

So, cosθ = -cos37° => θ = arccos(-cos37°) = 180° - 37° = 143°

Wait, but angle between two lines is the acute or obtuse angle between them, whichever is smaller. Here, 143° is obtuse, but the actual angle between BA and BG is 143°, but that seems large. However, since the problem states that angle ABG is equal to angle 2, which we don't know yet. 

But this calculation shows that angle ABG is 143°, but that seems too big. Did I do something wrong? 

Wait, no. Because the angle between two vectors can be reflex, but in geometry, we usually consider the smaller angle unless specified otherwise. However, in this case, since angle ABG is formed by BA and BG, which are two rays emanating from B. So, depending on the direction of BG, the angle could be the smaller or larger angle. 

However, in our case, since BG is going downward from B, and BA is going left from B, the angle between them would be the angle you turn from BA to BG. If you face left (BA), then turn clockwise toward BG, which is downward. The angle between them is 90° (from left to down) minus the 37° below x-axis? Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. 

Alternatively, let me think of it as follows: the line FG makes an angle of 37° with BC (which is along x-axis). Since FG passes through B, and BG is on the opposite side of B from BF, then BG is in the direction opposite to BF. If BF is at +37° from x-axis, then BG is at -37° from x-axis. 

So, the angle between BA (which is along negative x-axis) and BG (which is at -37°) is the angle between negative x-axis and -37° direction. 

This is equivalent to the angle between negative x-axis and a line that is 37° below the x-axis. So, if you imagine the negative x-axis pointing left, and a line going down at 37° from x-axis, then the angle between them is 90° - 37° = 53°, because from the negative x-axis, turning down 37° would require moving 90° - 37° = 53° to align with the downward direction. 

Wait, that makes sense. For example, if BG were directly downward (along negative y-axis), then the angle between BA (left) and BG (down) would be 90°. If BG is 37° below the x-axis, then it's closer to the x-axis, so the angle between BA and BG is 90° - 37° = 53°. 

Yes! So, angle ABG is 53°, which is equal to angle 2. 

Now, recall that angle GBD is angle 1, which we need to find. 

What is angle GBD? It is the angle between GB and BD. 

Since BD is along the positive y-axis (perpendicular to BC), and BG is at -37° from x-axis. 

So, the direction of BG is -37° from x-axis, and BD is along positive y-axis (90° from x-axis). 

To find the angle between BG and BD, we can subtract their angles from the x-axis. 

BG is at -37°, which is equivalent to 360° - 37° = 323°. BD is at 90°. 

The angle between BG and BD is the difference between 323° and 90°, but since angles wrap around, we take the smallest angle. 

Calculating 323° - 90° = 233°, which is more than 180°, so the smaller angle is 360° - 233° = 127°. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should compute the absolute difference between the two angles. 

Alternatively, think of BD as 90°, and BG as -37° (or equivalently, 323°). The angle between them is the minimal angle you can rotate from BG to BD. 

Since BG is at -37° (pointing to the fourth quadrant), and BD is at 90° (pointing to the second quadrant). The angle between them would be 90° - (-37°) = 127°, but since angles are typically measured as the smallest angle, which would be 180° - 127° = 53°? Wait, no. Wait, if you have two lines, one at -37° and one at 90°, the angle between them is 90° - (-37°) = 127°, but that's greater than 90°, so the smaller angle is 360° - 127° = 233°, which is still not helpful. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning directions. Let me re-express this. 

BD is along positive y-axis (90° from x-axis). BG is at -37° from x-axis (which is 37° below x-axis). So, to find the angle between BD (positive y-axis) and BG (37° below x-axis), imagine drawing a line from B in the direction of BG (downward to the right), and BD is straight up. The angle between them is measured from BG to BD. 

Visually, from BG (downward-right) to BD (straight-up), you'd rotate counterclockwise from BG to BD. How many degrees is that? 

Starting from BG at -37°, rotating counterclockwise to BD at 90°, the angle would be 90° - (-37°) = 127°, but since that's more than 90°, the smaller angle is 360° - 127° = 233°, which is not possible. Wait, this indicates a mistake. 

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate using vectors. 

Vector BD is (0,1) (along positive y-axis). Vector BG is (cos(-37°), sin(-37°)) = (cos(37°), -sin(37°)). 

The angle between BD and BG can be found using the dot product: 

cosθ = (BD · BG) / (|BD| * |BG|)

BD · BG = 0*cos(37°) + 1*(-sin(37°)) = -sin(37°)

|BD| = 1, |BG| = 1

So, cosθ = -sin(37°)

Which means θ = arccos(-sin37°). Let me compute sin37° ≈ 0.6, so cosθ ≈ -0.6 → θ ≈ 126.87°, which is approximately 127°. 

But angle between two lines is the smallest angle between them, so if it's 127°, then the smaller angle is 180° - 127° = 53°, because 127° is obtuse, so the acute angle would be its supplement. 

Ah! Yes! Because the angle between two lines is always taken as the smallest angle between them, so even though the dot product gives us an obtuse angle, the actual angle between them is the acute or obtuse one, whichever is smaller. In this case, since 127° is obtuse, the acute angle is 180° - 127° = 53°. 

So, angle between BD and BG is 53°, which is angle GBD. Wait, but angle GBD is angle 1, which we need to find. 

Wait, but earlier I had angle ABG as 53°, which was equal to angle 2. And now, angle GBD is 53°, which is angle 1. But according to the given, angle CBF is 37°, and angle GBD is angle 1. So, this suggests that angle 1 is 53°, which would correspond to option C. 

But let me verify once again. 

We said that angle ABG is 53°, which is equal to angle 2. Then, angle GBD is 53°, which is angle 1. Hence, the answer would be 53°, which is option C. 

But let me check if there are alternative interpretations. For example, what if BF was on the other side of BD, making the angle between BF and BD as 37° + 90°, but that would be 127°, leading to different results. But since angle CBF is 37°, and BD is perpendicular to BC, it's logical that BF is on the same side as BD, making the angle between BF and BD as 53°, leading to angle GBD as 53°. 

Another way to think about it: since angle CBF is 37°, and BD is perpendicular to BC, then the remaining angle between BF and BD is 90° - 37° = 53°, which is angle FBD. Then, since BG is on the same line as BF extended beyond B, then angle between BG and BD would be supplementary to angle FBD if they are on a straight line. Wait, no. If BF and BG are on the same line FG, then angle FBD and angle GBD would be supplementary if they are on opposite sides of BD. 

Wait, hold on. If BF is on one side of BD, and BG is on the other side of BD (since they are on the same line FG passing through B), then angle between BF and BD is 53°, and angle between BG and BD would be 180° - 53° = 127°, but since we take the smaller angle, it would be 53°? No, wait. 

Wait, if BF is on one side of BD, making an angle of 53° with BD, then BG is on the opposite side of BD, so the angle between BG and BD would be 180° - 53° = 127°, but since angle between lines is the smallest angle, it would be 180° - 127° = 53°? No, that doesn't make sense. 

Wait, I think my previous conclusion that angle GBD is 53° comes from the vector calculation, which gave us that the angle between BD and BG is 53°, which would be angle GBD. So that's consistent. 

Therefore, angle 1 is 53°, which corresponds to option C. 

But let me cross-verify with the initial assumption. 

Earlier, we found that angle ABG is 53°, which is angle 2, and angle GBD is 53°, which is angle 1. However, is there any relation between angle 2 and angle 1 that we missed? The problem didn't specify anything else, so unless there's another constraint, both angles being 53° is acceptable. 

But why is angle ABG equal to angle 2? The problem says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,G)), MeasureOf(angle 2)), so angle ABG = angle 2. But we've just computed angle ABG as 53°, implying angle 2 is 53°, and angle 1 is also 53°, which may not necessarily be conflicting. Unless there's another relationship. 

Wait, maybe there's another approach. Since BD is perpendicular to BC, then triangle BCD is a right triangle? Or maybe triangle BCG? Not sure. 

Alternatively, since angle CBF = 37°, and angle ABG = angle 2, and angle GBD = angle 1, and we found angle 1 = 53°, then the answer is C. 

But let me check with another method. 

In the coordinate system, with B at (0,0), C at (1,0), BD along y-axis. Point F is along the line making 37° with BC (x-axis), so coordinates of F can be parametrized. Let me pick t such that BF is length t, so coordinates of F are (t cos(37°), t sin(37°)). 

Then, line FG passes through B, so G is in the opposite direction from F, so coordinates of G would be (-k cos(37°), -k sin(37°)) for some k. 

Now, angle GBD is the angle between BG and BD. Vector BG is from B to G: (-k cos(37°), -k sin(37°)). Vector BD is (0,1). 

As before, the angle between BG and BD is calculated as:

cosθ = (BG · BD)/( |BG| |BD| ) 

= [ (-k cos(37°))*0 + (-k sin(37°))*1 ] / (k * 1 )

= -k sin(37°) / k = -sin(37°)

Therefore, θ = arccos(-sin37°). As before, this gives θ ≈ 127°, but the smaller angle is 180° - 127° = 53°, confirming that angle GBD is 53°, hence angle 1 is 53°, which is option C. 

Therefore, the correct answer should be C. 

I think this solidifies the conclusion. So, Final Answer: C.

To determine $ m\angle 1 $, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration based on the given constraints:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Given Constraints**

We are told:

- $ \text{MeasureOf}(\angle CBF) = 37^\circ $
- $ \text{MeasureOf}(\angle ABG) = \text{MeasureOf}(angle 2) $
- $ \text{MeasureOf}(\angle GBD) = \text{MeasureOf}(angle 1) $
- Point $ B $ lies on lines $ AC $, $ DE $, and $ FG $
- $ \overline{BD} \perp \overline{BC} $

These imply:

- Lines $ AC $, $ DE $, and $ FG $ all intersect at point $ B $
- $ \angle CBD = 90^\circ $ due to the perpendicularity of $ BD $ and $ BC $

---

### **Step 2: Visualize the Configuration**

Place point $ B $ at the origin $(0,0)$, and define coordinate axes:

- Let $ \overrightarrow{BC} $ lie along the positive x-axis (from $ B $ to $ C $)
- Then $ \overrightarrow{BD} $, being perpendicular to $ \overrightarrow{BC} $, lies along the positive y-axis
- The line $ FG $, passing through $ B $, intersects $ \overrightarrow{BC} $ at an angle of $ 37^\circ $. Thus, the direction of $ \overrightarrow{BF} $ makes a $ 37^\circ $ angle with $ \overrightarrow{BC} $, i.e., $ \angle CBF = 37^\circ $

Because $ \overline{FG} $ is a straight line through $ B $, the segment $ \overrightarrow{BG} $ lies in the opposite direction of $ \overrightarrow{BF} $, i.e., it makes a $ -37^\circ $ angle with the x-axis.

### **Step 3: Compute $ \angle GBD $ (i.e., $ \angle 1 $)**

We want to compute the angle between vectors $ \vec{BD} $ and $ \vec{BG} $:

- $ \vec{BD} $ points along the positive y-axis ⇒ Direction: $ 90^\circ $
- $ \vec{BG} $ makes an angle of $ -37^\circ $ with the x-axis ⇒ Direction: $ -37^\circ $

The angle between these two vectors is the **smallest** angle between them, which is:

$$
\theta = |90^\circ - (-37^\circ)| = 127^\circ
$$

However, since this is an obtuse angle, the **acute angle** between them is:

$$
180^\circ - 127^\circ = 53^\circ
$$

Hence,

$$
m\angle GBD = 53^\circ
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

Since $ \angle GBD = \angle 1 $, we conclude:

$$
m\angle 1 = 53^\circ
$$
