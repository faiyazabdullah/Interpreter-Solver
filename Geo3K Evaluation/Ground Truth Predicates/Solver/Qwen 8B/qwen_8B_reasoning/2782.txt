MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find the value of x given these geometric constraints. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, the problem mentions points A, B, and C. The given information includes:

- The length of line BC is 14√3.
- The length of line AB is y (but we don't know y yet).
- The measure of angle at point B, between points A, B, C, is 30 degrees.
- The length of line AC is x, which is what we need to find.
- Also, lines CB and CA are perpendicular. Wait, no—wait, it says Perpendicular(Line(C,B), Line(C,A)). So that means the lines CB and CA are perpendicular. So at point C, the lines CB and CA form a right angle. Wait, but angle at C? Or maybe I misread.

Wait, the Perpendicular condition is between Line(C,B) and Line(C,A). So those two lines meet at point C, so they form a right angle at point C. Therefore, triangle ABC has a right angle at point C. Wait, but then angle at C is 90 degrees. However, another given is angle at B, angle ABC is 30 degrees. Let me try to sketch this mentally.

So, triangle ABC with right angle at C. Then angle at B is 30 degrees. Let me recall that in a right-angled triangle, the angles are related. If there's a right angle at C, then angles at A and B add up to 90 degrees. Given angle at B is 30 degrees, so angle at A would be 60 degrees.

But wait, the sides opposite these angles... Let me think about the sides. In a right-angled triangle, the side opposite the right angle is the hypotenuse. Here, since the right angle is at C, then AB is the hypotenuse. Because the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. So AB is the hypotenuse.

Given that, the sides adjacent to the right angle are BC and AC. Wait, BC is given as 14√3. So BC is one leg, AC is the other leg, and AB is the hypotenuse.

Also, angle at B is 30 degrees. Let me recall that in a right-angled triangle, the sides are related to the angles. For example, if we have a right triangle with angles 30°, 60°, 90°, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. Specifically, the side opposite 30° is half the hypotenuse.

In this case, angle at B is 30°, so the side opposite angle B is AC. Wait, because in triangle ABC, angle at B is 30°, so the side opposite angle B is AC. Wait, let me confirm:

In triangle ABC, each angle corresponds to the opposite side. So angle at A is opposite BC, angle at B is opposite AC, angle at C is opposite AB.

Since angle at B is 30°, then the side opposite angle B is AC. Therefore, AC = x is opposite the 30° angle. And since the triangle is right-angled at C, then AB is the hypotenuse.

So in such a triangle, the side opposite 30° is half the hypotenuse. Wait, yes! In a 30-60-90 triangle, the side opposite 30° is half the hypotenuse. Therefore, if angle B is 30°, then AC (opposite angle B) should be half of AB.

But also, BC is adjacent to angle B. Wait, angle B is 30°, and BC is adjacent to angle B. Let me check again.

Alternatively, perhaps using trigonometric ratios. Since we have a right triangle at C, with right angle at C. So angle at B is 30°, so tan(angle B) equals opposite over adjacent. Which would be AC / BC.

Because angle at B: the opposite side is AC, and the adjacent side is BC.

Therefore, tan(30°) = AC / BC.

We know BC is 14√3, so:

tan(30°) = x / (14√3)

But tan(30°) is 1/√3. So:

1/√3 = x / (14√3)

Multiply both sides by 14√3:

x = (14√3) * (1/√3) = 14.

Wait, that gives x = 14. But let me check if that makes sense.

Alternatively, since in a 30-60-90 triangle, sides are 1, √3, 2. The side opposite 30° is the shortest one. So here, if angle B is 30°, then AC is opposite angle B, so AC is the shorter leg. Then BC is adjacent to angle B, so BC is longer than AC?

Wait, but according to our calculation above, BC is 14√3, and AC is 14. So that would mean BC is longer than AC, which aligns with angle B being 30°, since the side opposite 30° is shorter. So that seems okay.

But let me verify with Pythagoras. If AC is 14, BC is 14√3, then AB^2 = AC² + BC² = 14² + (14√3)^2 = 196 + 14²*3 = 196 + 196*3 = 196*(1+3)=196*4=784. Therefore AB is sqrt(784)=28. So AB is 28. Then, since angle B is 30°, and the hypotenuse is 28, then the side opposite 30° is half the hypotenuse, so 14. That matches our calculation. Therefore, x is 14. So the answer should be option A, 14.

Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't mix up the sides. Another way: in triangle ABC, right-angled at C. So angle at B is 30°, so angle at A is 60°. Then, side BC is adjacent to angle B, so BC = adjacent, AC is opposite angle B. So tan(30) = AC / BC => AC = BC * tan(30) = 14√3 * (1/√3) = 14. Yep, same result.

Alternatively, using sine. Sin(angle B) = opposite / hypotenuse. So sin(30°) = AC / AB. We know sin(30°) is 1/2, so AC = AB * 1/2. But AB can be found via Pythagoras. Wait, but we could also use cos(angle B) = adjacent / hypotenuse. Cos(30°) = BC / AB. So BC = AB * cos(30°). Let me compute AB.

From earlier, BC = 14√3. So:

AB = BC / cos(30°) = 14√3 / (√3 / 2 ) = 14√3 * 2 / √3 = 28. Then AC = AB * sin(30°) = 28 * 1/2 = 14. Same result. So x = 14. Therefore, the answer is A.

Looking back at the answer choices, A is 14. So the correct answer is A.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we analyze the geometric configuration defined by the constraints:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Triangle Structure**

We are given three key pieces of geometric information involving triangle $ \triangle ABC $:

- $ \angle ABC = 30^\circ $
- $ \angle ACB = 90^\circ $ (since the lines $ CB $ and $ CA $ are perpendicular)
- $ |BC| = 14\sqrt{3} $

This tells us that triangle $ \triangle ABC $ is a **right triangle** with a **right angle at point C**, and an angle of $ 30^\circ $ at point B.

---

### **Step 2: Use Trigonometry in Right Triangles**

In a right triangle, the tangent of an acute angle relates the lengths of the opposite and adjacent sides:

$$
\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}
$$

Here, angle $ \angle ABC = 30^\circ $. The side **opposite** this angle is $ AC $, and the **adjacent** side is $ BC $.

Let’s denote:
- $ AC = x $
- $ BC = 14\sqrt{3} $

Then:

$$
\tan(30^\circ) = \frac{x}{14\sqrt{3}}
$$

We know:

$$
\tan(30^\circ) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
$$

Substitute into the equation:

$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{x}{14\sqrt{3}}
$$

Now multiply both sides by $ 14\sqrt{3} $:

$$
x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot 14\sqrt{3} = 14
$$

---

### **Step 3: Final Verification**

As a verification, consider the standard 30–60–90 triangle ratios. These triangles have sides in the ratio:

$$
1 : \sqrt{3} : 2
$$

Where:
- Side opposite $ 30^\circ $ is the **shortest leg**
- Side opposite $ 60^\circ $ is the **longer leg**
- Hypotenuse is twice the shortest leg

In this case:
- $ \angle B = 30^\circ $ → Opposite side is $ AC = x $
- Adjacent side to $ \angle B $ is $ BC = 14\sqrt{3} $
- Hence, $ x < 14\sqrt{3} $, consistent with $ x = 14 $

---

### **Conclusion**

The only valid value for $ x $ satisfying all conditions is:

$$
\boxed{14}
$$
