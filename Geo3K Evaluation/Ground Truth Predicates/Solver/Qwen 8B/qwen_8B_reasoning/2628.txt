MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. Hmm, first I need to visualize the diagram based on the given constraints. Let me start by listing out all the information provided.

So, there are several points mentioned: L, K, G, F, N, H, J, M, P. The problem involves circles centered at M with radius 2.0 (since PointLiesOnCircle for points like P, H, G, J, K, F are all on circle M with that radius). Also, there are lines connecting these points, and some perpendicularity conditions. 

The question asks for NJ, given that FL = 24, HJ = 48, and the measure of arc HP is 65 degrees. The answer choices are A. 24, B. 32, C. 48, D. 65. 

First, let me recall that since all these points (P, H, G, J, K, F) lie on the same circle centered at M with radius 2.0, so the distance from M to each of these points is 2 units. Wait, but then FL and HJ are lengths given as 24 and 48. That seems large compared to the radius. Maybe FL and HJ aren't chords of the circle? Or perhaps they are related to segments involving points outside the circle?

Wait, the problem says "In ⊙M", which probably means all the points mentioned are on or related to circle M. But FL and HJ are line segments whose lengths are given. Let me think about how these could be connected.

Let me parse the constraints again:

- Point L lies on both Line(M,K) and Line(G,F). So point L is the intersection of lines MK and GF. Similarly, point N lies on lines HJ and MP. So N is the intersection of lines HJ and MP.

Also, Perpendicular conditions: Line LG is perpendicular to Line LK, and Line NP is perpendicular to Line NJ. Wait, the perpendiculars are between lines LG and LK, meaning that those two lines form a right angle at point L. Similarly, lines NP and NJ are perpendicular at point N.

Given that FL = 24, HJ = 48, and arc HP measures 65 degrees. Need to find NJ.

First, maybe draw a rough sketch mentally. Let's consider circle M with radius 2. Points F, G, H, J, K, P are on the circle. Then lines connecting them:

- Line MK: connects M to K, and L lies on it. Also, line GF connects G to F, and L lies on that line. So L is the intersection of MK and GF.

Similarly, N lies on HJ and MP. So HJ is a line connecting H and J, and MP connects M to P; their intersection is N. Also, NP is perpendicular to NJ.

Now, the key elements here might involve power of a point, similar triangles, or using properties of circles and angles.

But first, let's note that FL and HJ are given. Since FL is a segment from F to L, and HJ is a segment from H to J. However, HJ is part of the line HJ, which passes through N. Since H and J are points on the circle, HJ is a chord of the circle. Given that HJ = 48, but the radius is 2.0. Wait, that can't be possible unless HJ is not a chord of the circle. Because the maximum possible length of a chord in a circle of radius r is 2r, which would be 4.0 here. But HJ is given as 48. Therefore, HJ must not be a chord of the circle. Instead, HJ is a segment that starts at H (on the circle) and goes through N, ending at J (which is also on the circle)? Wait, no. Wait, the problem states that N lies on line HJ. So line HJ passes through N. But H and J are points on the circle. So line HJ is a secant line passing through N. Therefore, HJ is a chord of the circle extended beyond H and J to pass through N? Wait, but H and J are endpoints of the chord. If N is on line HJ, then depending on where N is, it could be inside or outside the circle.

But given that H and J are points on the circle, and N is another point on line HJ. Let me think. Let's denote that HJ is a chord of the circle, and N is a point on line HJ. So, if N is inside the circle, then HN * NJ = something? Wait, power of a point. For example, if N is inside the circle, then for a chord HJ, the power of N would be HN * NJ = (distance from N to center)^2 - radius^2? Wait, no. Power of a point N with respect to circle M is equal to HN * NJ = (power of N). Since N is inside the circle, the power is negative, and equals -(distance from N to center squared minus radius squared). Alternatively, if N is outside, then HN * NJ equals the square of the tangent from N to the circle.

But we don't know whether N is inside or outside the circle. Let's see. Since N lies on line HJ, which has endpoints H and J on the circle. Suppose N is between H and J, then HN + NJ = HJ. But HJ is given as 48. But since H and J are on the circle of radius 2, the length of chord HJ should be less than or equal to 4. So HJ being 48 suggests that N is not between H and J, but rather outside the segment HJ. So N is outside the circle, lying on the extension of HJ beyond either H or J. Therefore, HN * NJ would be equal to the power of point N with respect to circle M.

Similarly, for FL = 24. Since F is on the circle, and L is a point such that L lies on line GF and line MK. So maybe FL is a segment from F to L, which is outside the circle? Let's check.

Alternatively, maybe FL is a chord? But F is on the circle, and L is somewhere else. If L is outside the circle, then FL could be a secant line. But without knowing more about L's position, it's hard to tell. But maybe we can use the fact that FL = 24 and HJ = 48, along with the arc HP measure 65 degrees, to relate these quantities.

Additionally, we have the perpendicularity conditions. At point L, lines LG and LK are perpendicular. Since L lies on lines GF and MK. So maybe triangle GLK is a right triangle? Or maybe something else.

But let's focus first on HJ = 48. Since H and J are on the circle, and N lies on line HJ. Assuming N is outside the circle, then power of point N with respect to circle M is NH * NJ = (length of tangent from N to M)^2.

But we need to find NJ. Let me write down variables:

Let’s denote the length of HN as x, and NJ as y. Then since N is on line HJ, depending on its position, the total length HJ would be |x - y| if N is beyond one of the points, or x + y if between. But earlier thought was that HJ is 48, which is much larger than the diameter of the circle (which is 4), so likely N is outside the segment HJ. So suppose that N is beyond J, making HJ = 48, and NJ is the segment from N to J, so HN = HJ + JN = 48 + NJ. Wait, no. If N is beyond J, then HN = HJ + JN. But HJ is the length from H to J, which is 48. Wait, but H and J are points on the circle, so the actual length of chord HJ should be 2r sin(theta/2), where theta is the central angle between H and J. But since r is 2, maximum chord length is 4. Hence, HJ cannot be 48. Therefore, my assumption that N is on line HJ beyond J is wrong because that would make HJ = 48 impossible. Therefore, perhaps N is located such that line HJ is extended beyond H, making HN = HJ + JN? No, that still doesn't resolve the issue. Wait, maybe HJ is not the straight-line distance between H and J, but the length of segment HJ, which includes N? Wait, no. The problem says HJ = 48. So if H and J are points on the circle, then the straight-line distance between H and J is HJ. But that must be a chord of the circle. Which can't be longer than 4. So this suggests that there's a misunderstanding here.

Wait, hold on! The problem says "HJ = 48". But H and J are points on the circle with radius 2. So the distance between H and J must be less than or equal to the diameter, which is 4. Therefore, HJ can't be 48. This implies that HJ is not the straight-line distance between H and J, but instead refers to the length of the segment from H to J passing through N? Wait, but N is on line HJ. So if N is between H and J, then HJ is split into HN and NJ, so HJ = HN + NJ. But even if N is between H and J, the maximum value of HJ would still be the length of the chord, which is up to 4. So HJ = 48 is impossible. Therefore, there must be a misinterpretation here.

Wait, maybe the notation HJ refers to the length of the entire line segment HJ, which includes N? But that still doesn't help. Unless HJ is not the chord, but a different segment. Wait, maybe H and J are not on the circle? But according to the constraints, PointLiesOnCircle(H, Circle(M, radius_2_0)), so H is on the circle. Same for J. So HJ must be a chord of the circle, but the given length is 48, which contradicts. There must be a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, wait! The problem says "FL = 24, HJ = 48, and m∠HP = 65". Maybe FL and HJ are not straight-line distances, but something else? Like, maybe FL is the length of a tangent or something else? Or maybe FL is the length of a segment that isn't directly between F and L? Or perhaps there's a typo in the problem statement?

Alternatively, maybe the radius is not 2.0 but 20? Wait, the original constraint says PointLiesOnCircle(P, Circle(M, radius_2_0)). So radius is 2.0. But that leads to inconsistency with HJ = 48. Maybe the radius is actually 20? Let me check again.

Wait, the user wrote: "PointLiesOnCircle(P, Circle(M, radius_2_0))" — but that's just a placeholder. It's possible that the radius is 20. Maybe there was a formatting error, and the radius is 20 instead of 2.0. Because otherwise, HJ=48 is impossible. Let me assume that the radius is 20. That makes sense. For example, if the circle has radius 20, then the maximum chord length is 40, and HJ=48 could be possible if N is outside the circle. Wait, but then HJ would be the length of the segment from H to J, which is a chord of the circle. But if N is on line HJ, then HJ is a chord, and N is a point on that line. So if N is outside the circle, then HN * NJ would be equal to the power of point N with respect to the circle.

Let me proceed under the assumption that there was a formatting error, and the radius is 20, not 2.0. Otherwise, the problem is inconsistent. So assuming radius is 20, which would make sense for HJ=48. Let's go with that.

Therefore, assuming radius is 20, so circle M has radius 20. Points H, J, P, etc., are on this circle. Now, HJ is a chord of the circle, and N is a point on line HJ. So HJ is a chord of length 48. Wait, but the maximum chord length for radius 20 is 40, so HJ can't be 48. So even with radius 20, HJ=48 is too long. Therefore, there's a contradiction. Therefore, maybe the radius is 24, or the problem uses different units?

Alternatively, maybe FL and HJ are not chords, but something else. Let me re-examine the problem.

Wait, the problem says "In ⊙M, FL = 24, HJ = 48..." So FL and HJ are segments in the figure. Given that FL is a segment from F to L, and HJ is from H to J. But F and H are points on the circle, as well as J. If L is not on the circle, then FL could be longer than the radius. Similarly, HJ could be longer than the diameter if N is outside the circle.

Let me consider that N is outside the circle, lying on line HJ. So HJ is a chord of the circle, and N is outside the circle on the line extending beyond J. Then, HN * NJ = (power of N). The power of N is equal to the square of the tangent from N to the circle. Also, since N lies on line HJ, and HJ is a chord, then HN * NJ = NT², where NT is the length of the tangent from N to the circle.

Similarly, for FL = 24, if L is outside the circle, then FL * something equals power of L. But I need to figure out which segments are involved.

But first, let's handle HJ = 48. Let me denote the length of the chord HJ as c = 48. Wait, but with radius r, the maximum chord length is 2r. So if c = 48, then 2r ≥ 48 ⇒ r ≥ 24. So if the radius is 24, then the maximum chord length is 48. Therefore, maybe the radius is 24? Wait, the initial constraints say radius is 2.0, but that seems conflicting. Perhaps there was a typo in the problem statement, and the radius is 24? Or maybe FL and HJ are not chords but other segments?

Alternatively, maybe the radius is 2, and HJ is not a chord but a secant line passing through N, so that HJ is the external part? Wait, let me think differently.

If N is outside the circle, then for chord HJ, the power of N is HN * NJ = NT², where NT is the length of the tangent from N to the circle. If HJ is the chord, then the length of the chord itself is HJ = sqrt( (HN - NJ)(HN + NJ) ) ? No, that formula isn't quite right. Wait, for a chord, the length is 2√(r² - d²), where d is the distance from the center to the chord. But if N is outside the circle, then the power is HN * NJ = (distance from N to center)^2 - r².

But without knowing where N is relative to the circle, it's hard to compute. However, given that HJ = 48, and assuming that N is on line HJ outside the circle, then HJ is part of the line. Let me define variables:

Let’s assume that N is outside the circle, and line HJ extends through N. Let’s denote the distance from N to H as a, and from N to J as b. Then the length of HJ is |a - b|. But since N is outside, depending on which side it is. Suppose N is beyond J, then HJ = a - b, where a = HN and b = NJ. Wait, but HJ is given as 48. So if N is beyond J, then HJ = HN - NJ = 48. So HN = NJ + 48. Then, the power of N is HN * NJ = (NJ + 48) * NJ = NT². But we don't know NT yet.

But we also know that the arc HP measures 65 degrees. Arc HP is the arc from H to P on the circle. So the central angle ∠HMP is 65 degrees, since M is the center. Therefore, the length of the arc HP is 65 degrees, which relates to the chord length HP. The chord length HP can be calculated using the formula 2r sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle. So HP = 2r sin(65° / 2).

But how does this relate to finding NJ?

Alternatively, maybe we need to find the length of NJ using power of a point, relating to other known values.

But we also have FL = 24. Let me think about FL. Point L is on lines MK and GF. So L is the intersection of MK and GF. Also, FL is a segment from F to L. Since F is on the circle, and L is somewhere else. If L is outside the circle, then FL could be a secant line, and the power of point L would be LF * something = LT².

But without knowing more about the configuration, it's challenging. However, there's also the perpendicularity condition: at point L, lines LG and LK are perpendicular. So triangle GLK is a right triangle at L. So maybe using Pythagoras theorem here?

Let me try to summarize:

We need to find NJ. We know HJ = 48, and arc HP = 65°, and FL = 24. The circle has radius r (assuming it's corrected to 24, as previously discussed). Let me assume that the radius is 24, since that allows HJ=48 as a possible chord length (maximum chord length is 48 when radius is 24). Wait, maximum chord length is 2*radius, so if radius is 24, then max chord length is 48. Perfect! So that explains why HJ is 48. So the radius is 24, not 2.0. Probably there was a formatting error in the problem statement, and the radius is 24. Let's proceed with that assumption.

Thus, circle M has radius 24. Points H, J, P, F, G, K are on the circle. Now, HJ is a chord of length 48, which means it's the diameter. Because maximum chord length is 2r = 48. So HJ is the diameter of the circle. Therefore, H and J are endpoints of the diameter. Thus, the center M is the midpoint of HJ. Wait, but M is the center. If H and J are endpoints of a diameter, then M is the midpoint of HJ. Therefore, HM = MJ = 24. So the length HJ = 48.

But earlier, the problem mentions PointLiesOnCircle(P, Circle(M, radius_2_0)). So if the radius is 24, that would mean the radius is 24. So the original problem may have had a typo, writing "radius_2_0" instead of "radius_24". Assuming that, let's proceed.

So, HJ is the diameter of the circle. Therefore, N lies on line HJ, which is the diameter. Since N is on line HJ, and HJ is the diameter, then N is either on the line extending beyond H, J, or between them. But earlier, we thought N is outside the circle because HJ=48. But if HJ is the diameter, then the circle has radius 24, so the diameter is 48. If N is on the line HJ, then if N is between H and J, it's inside the circle. If it's beyond H or J, it's outside. But since HJ is already the diameter, and N is on line HJ, then the power of N with respect to the circle is HN * NJ = (distance from N to M)^2 - r^2.

But since HJ is the diameter, let's denote coordinates to simplify. Let me place the circle with center M at the origin (0,0). Let me set coordinates such that H is (-24, 0), J is (24, 0), making HJ the horizontal diameter. Then, line HJ is the x-axis. Point N is somewhere on the x-axis. If N is beyond J, then N has coordinates (24 + t, 0), where t > 0. If N is beyond H, then it's (-24 - t, 0). Let's suppose N is beyond J, so N is at (24 + t, 0). Then, HN is the distance from H(-24, 0) to N(24 + t, 0): that is (24 + t) - (-24) = 48 + t. And NJ is the distance from N to J(24, 0): t. Therefore, HN * NJ = (48 + t) * t.

According to the power of a point, this product equals the power of N with respect to the circle, which is ON² - r², where O is the center M. Here, ON is the distance from N to M, which is the distance from (24 + t, 0) to (0,0): sqrt((24 + t)^2 + 0^2) = 24 + t. So the power is (24 + t)^2 - 24^2 = (24 + t)^2 - 24^2 = (t)(48 + t). Which matches the product HN * NJ. So this checks out. Therefore, HN * NJ = t*(48 + t). But we don't know t, so how do we find it?

But we also have other information: arc HP = 65 degrees. Let's recall that arc HP corresponds to the central angle ∠HMP = 65 degrees. So point P is located on the circle such that the central angle between H and P is 65 degrees. Since H is at (-24, 0), let's find coordinates of P. Let me calculate the coordinates of P.

Since the central angle between H and P is 65 degrees. Assuming standard position, starting from H at (-24, 0), moving counterclockwise by 65 degrees. The coordinates of P can be calculated as follows:

The angle for point H is 180 degrees (since it's on the left end of the x-axis). Adding 65 degrees gives 180 + 65 = 245 degrees. So point P is at 245 degrees from the positive x-axis. Converting this to coordinates:

x-coordinate: r * cos(245°)
y-coordinate: r * sin(245°)

With r = 24, so:

cos(245°) = cos(180 + 65) = -cos(65°)
sin(245°) = sin(180 + 65) = -sin(65°)

So coordinates of P are:

x_P = 24 * (-cos65°)
y_P = 24 * (-sin65°)

Now, we also have point N on line HJ (the x-axis), and the perpendicularity condition: Line NP is perpendicular to Line NJ.

Wait, the problem states: Perpendicular(Line(N, P), Line(N, J)). So line NP is perpendicular to line NJ at point N. Since N is on the x-axis, and J is at (24, 0), line NJ is the segment from N to J, which is along the x-axis. Therefore, line NJ is horizontal. For line NP to be perpendicular to NJ, line NP must be vertical. Therefore, line NP is vertical, implying that point P has the same x-coordinate as N. Because line NP is vertical if P is directly above or below N on the vertical line passing through N.

But N is on the x-axis, so if line NP is vertical, then P must have the same x-coordinate as N. So the x-coordinate of P equals the x-coordinate of N. From earlier, the x-coordinate of P is 24 * (-cos65°). Therefore, the x-coordinate of N is equal to that.

Let me denote the x-coordinate of N as n. So n = 24 * (-cos65°). Therefore, N is at (n, 0). Then, since N is on the x-axis, and line NP is vertical, so P is at (n, y_p). But P is on the circle, so its coordinates must satisfy x^2 + y^2 = 24^2. Substituting x = n and y = y_p:

n² + y_p² = 24².

But we also have that P is at (n, y_p), and earlier we had that x_P = 24 * (-cos65°) = n. So n = -24 cos65°. Let's compute that value numerically.

First, compute cos65°. Cos65° ≈ 0.4226. So n ≈ -24 * 0.4226 ≈ -10.1424. So the x-coordinate of N is approximately -10.1424. But earlier, we assumed that N is beyond J, which is at (24, 0), but this calculation shows that N is at x ≈ -10.14, which is between H(-24, 0) and J(24, 0). Wait, but that contradicts our previous assumption that N is outside the circle. Wait, but if N is between H and J, then it's inside the circle. Let's check if this is consistent.

If N is at x ≈ -10.14, which is between H(-24, 0) and J(24, 0), then the distance from N to M (origin) is sqrt(n² + 0²) = |n| ≈ 10.14, which is less than the radius 24. So yes, N is inside the circle. But earlier, we thought N is outside because of HJ=48. Wait, but HJ is the diameter, so its length is 48, which is fixed. If N is between H and J, then HJ is still the diameter. But how does that affect the power of point N?

Wait, the power of a point inside the circle is negative, and equals -(distance from center squared - r²). But since N is inside, the power is negative, and for a chord passing through N, we have HN * NJ = -(power) ?

Actually, the formula is: for a point N inside the circle, and a chord passing through N, then HN * NJ = r² - ON², where ON is the distance from N to the center. Wait, let me confirm:

Power of a point N inside the circle: for any chord through N, the product of the segments is equal to r² - ON². Yes. So in this case, HN * NJ = r² - ON².

But earlier, we derived that for N inside, HN * NJ = r² - ON². In our coordinate system, N is at (n, 0), so ON = |n|. Therefore, HN * NJ = r² - n².

But also, HN * NJ can be computed as follows: since N is between H and J, HN is the distance from H to N, which is |-24 - n|, and NJ is the distance from N to J, which is |24 - n|. Since N is between H and J, let's take n between -24 and 24. So HN = n - (-24) = n + 24 (if n > -24), and NJ = 24 - n. So HN * NJ = (n + 24)(24 - n) = 24² - n². Which matches the power formula. So indeed, HN * NJ = r² - n².

But earlier, we also have that n = -24 cos65°, so substituting into HN * NJ:

HN * NJ = 24² - n² = 24² - (24 cos65°)^2 = 24² (1 - cos²65°) = 24² sin²65°.

But also, from the coordinates, since P is vertically aligned with N, so NP is vertical. The length of NP is the vertical distance from N to P. Since P is on the circle, and N is at (n, 0), then the coordinates of P are (n, y_p), so y_p satisfies n² + y_p² = 24² => y_p = ±sqrt(24² - n²). But since earlier, we had that P is obtained by rotating H by 65 degrees around the center. Wait, earlier we said that the central angle between H and P is 65 degrees, so the coordinates of P were determined based on that. But we also have that P lies vertically above/below N. So combining these two pieces of information.

From the central angle, we had that P has x-coordinate n = -24 cos65°, and y-coordinate y_p = -24 sin65° (since P is in the third quadrant, given that the angle from H to P is 65 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise? Earlier, we considered it as 180 + 65 = 245 degrees, which places P in the third quadrant (negative x and y). So y_p is negative. Therefore, the coordinates of P are (n, y_p) = (-24 cos65°, -24 sin65°). Therefore, the y-coordinate of P is -24 sin65°, and the length NP is the vertical distance from N at (n, 0) to P at (n, y_p), which is |y_p - 0| = |y_p| = 24 sin65°.

But how does this relate to HN * NJ?

Earlier, we found that HN * NJ = 24² sin²65°, which is (24 sin65°)^2. But NP is 24 sin65°, so HN * NJ = (NP)^2. So HN * NJ = NP². But from the power of a point, HN * NJ = r² - ON². But since ON = |n|, and n = -24 cos65°, then ON = 24 |cos65°|. Therefore, r² - ON² = 24² - (24 cos65°)^2 = 24² (1 - cos²65°) = 24² sin²65°, which matches. So everything checks out.

However, how does this help us find NJ?

We need to find NJ. Recall that N is between H and J, so HN = n + 24, NJ = 24 - n. Wait, no: if N is at x = n, and J is at x = 24, then NJ is 24 - n. And HN is distance from H(-24,0) to N(n,0) is n - (-24) = n + 24. So HN * NJ = (n + 24)(24 - n) = 24² - n².

But we also have that HN * NJ = NP² = (24 sin65°)^2.

Therefore:

24² - n² = (24 sin65°)^2  
=> n² = 24² - (24 sin65°)^2  
=> n² = 24² (1 - sin²65°)  
=> n² = 24² cos²65°  
=> n = ±24 cos65°

But earlier, we found that n = -24 cos65°, so this aligns. Therefore, the value of n is -24 cos65°, which is negative, placing N between H(-24, 0) and J(24, 0), closer to H.

But we need to find NJ, which is 24 - n. Since n = -24 cos65°, then:

NJ = 24 - n = 24 - (-24 cos65°) = 24 + 24 cos65° = 24(1 + cos65°)

Compute this value numerically:

cos65° ≈ 0.4226

So NJ ≈ 24 * (1 + 0.4226) = 24 * 1.4226 ≈ 24 * 1.4226 ≈ let's calculate:

24 * 1.4 = 33.6, 24 * 0.0226 ≈ 0.5424 → Total ≈ 33.6 + 0.5424 ≈ 34.1424. So approximately 34.14.

Looking at the answer choices: A.24, B.32, C.48, D.65. Our approximate value is ~34.14, which is closest to option B.32. But wait, maybe there's an exact expression?

Alternatively, maybe there's an exact relation using trigonometric identities. Let me think.

We have NJ = 24(1 + cos65°). Is there a way to express this in terms of known values? Well, if we can relate 65 degrees to something else... Not sure. But let me check if 65° relates to arcs or other angles in the diagram.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better approach using the other given data, FL = 24. How does that come into play?

We have point L, which lies on lines MK and GF. Also, at point L, lines LG and LK are perpendicular. Let me try to analyze this.

Points G and F are on the circle. Let me recall that the circle has radius 24, and points F, G, K, P, H, J are on it. Let me try to determine the positions of these points.

We already placed H at (-24, 0), J at (24, 0), and P at (-24 cos65°, -24 sin65°). What about points G, K, F, and M?

Point L lies on lines MK and GF. Let me try to find relations involving L.

Also, FL = 24. So the distance from F to L is 24.

Assuming that FL is a segment from F to L, and since F is on the circle, which has radius 24, then FL could be a tangent or something else. But if L is outside the circle, then FL could be a secant or tangent. But we need to find relations.

But given that we also have the perpendicularity condition: at point L, lines LG and LK are perpendicular. So triangle GLK is right-angled at L.

This seems complex, but perhaps there's symmetry or specific positions that can be exploited.

Alternatively, since we're supposed to find NJ, which we approximated as ~34.14, and the closest answer is B.32, but maybe there's an exact calculation.

Wait, let's compute 24(1 + cos65°):

cos(65°) is approximately 0.4226, so 1 + cos65 ≈ 1.4226. Multiply by 24:

24 × 1.4226 ≈ 24 × 1.42 = 34.08, which is close to 34.14, confirming our approximation.

But none of the answer choices is 34.14. The closest is B.32. However, maybe there's an exact calculation using the given arc measure.

Wait, the arc HP is 65°, which is the central angle. So the inscribed angle over arc HP would be half of that, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Cosines on triangle HMP or something else.

Wait, but we're trying to find NJ, which we've expressed in terms of cos65°. Perhaps there's another relationship involving FL = 24 that allows us to connect it to NJ?

Let me think about FL = 24. Point F is on the circle. Let me try to find coordinates of F. Since we have points H, J, P, and others on the circle.

But without knowing the exact positions of F and G, it's difficult. However, since L lies on line GF and line MK, and FL = 24.

Maybe we can find coordinates of F and G?

Alternatively, since L is the intersection of MK and GF, and we have perpendicularity at L. Let me consider coordinates.

Let me attempt to assign coordinates to other points. We have H(-24, 0), J(24, 0), M(0, 0). Point P is at (-24 cos65°, -24 sin65°). What about points G, K, F?

We know that point L lies on Line(M, K) and Line(G, F). Also, FL = 24.

But without knowing the positions of G, K, F, it's challenging. Perhaps there's symmetry or specific placements.

Wait, since the circle has radius 24, and points F and G are on the circle. Let me assume that line GF intersects line MK at point L, and that at L, LG ⊥ LK. So triangle GLK is right-angled at L.

Perhaps there's a property here. Let me consider that since L is the intersection of MK and GF, and with the right angle condition.

But this seems too vague. Maybe we need to relate FL and NJ somehow. But without more info, it's tricky.

Wait, but earlier, we have that NJ ≈ 34.14, which is closest to 32. But let me think if there's another approach.

Wait, maybe the problem is designed so that NJ is equal to FL = 24? But that would be answer A, but our calculation suggests otherwise. Or perhaps NJ is related to the arc measure?

Alternatively, since the arc HP is 65°, which is the central angle, and if there's a relationship between that angle and the power of point N, or something else.

Wait, earlier we found that NJ = 24(1 + cos65°). Let me compute cos65° precisely.

Using calculator, cos65° ≈ 0.422618...

So 1 + cos65° ≈ 1.422618...

Multiply by 24: 24 × 1.4226 ≈ 34.1428.

But the answer choices are A.24, B.32, C.48, D.65. None of these match exactly. However, maybe there's a calculation mistake in assuming the radius is 24? Let me reconsider.

Wait, originally, the problem stated that all points lie on Circle(M, radius_2_0). If that's taken literally, the radius is 2.0, leading to contradictions. But if we ignore the radius and assume that the radius is such that HJ=48 is possible, then the radius must be 24. So, perhaps the original problem had a typo, and the radius is 24. In that case, NJ ≈ 34.14, which is closest to B.32. But maybe there's an exact value?

Alternatively, perhaps using the law of cosines on triangle HMP or something else.

Wait, the central angle for arc HP is 65°, so the chord HP has length 2r sin(θ/2) = 2*24*sin(65°/2). But how does this relate to NJ?

Alternatively, since we have NJ = 24(1 + cos65°), and if we can express this in terms of known quantities.

Wait, using the identity 1 + cosθ = 2cos²(θ/2). So:

NJ = 24 * 2cos²(65°/2) = 48cos²(32.5°)

But I don't know if that helps. Let me calculate cos(32.5°). 32.5° is half of 65°, so cos(32.5°) ≈ cos(π/4 - π/24) or whatever. But it's still not helpful for matching answer choices.

Alternatively, if 65° is a special angle? No, it's not a standard angle. So perhaps the intended answer is B.32, assuming that the problem expects an approximate value or there's a different approach.

Wait, let me check the options again: A.24, B.32, C.48, D.65. Since our calculation gave approximately 34.14, which is between 32 and 34, but the closest is B.32. But maybe the exact value is 32?

Wait, let me think differently. Perhaps the arc HP is 65°, and there's a relationship between the arc and the length NJ.

Wait, earlier, we found that NJ = 24(1 + cos65°). If I compute this with exact values, but perhaps using the Law of Cosines on triangle HMP or something else.

Wait, point N is inside the circle, and we have NJ = 24 - n, where n = -24 cos65°. So NJ = 24 + 24 cos65° = 24(1 + cos65°). Let me compute 1 + cos65° using exact methods.

But unless there's a specific value, it's hard. Alternatively, if the problem assumes that 65° is chosen such that cos65° = 0.5, then NJ would be 24(1 + 0.5) = 36, which is not an option. Or if cos65° = 0.25, then NJ = 24*1.25 = 30, still not matching. 

Alternatively, maybe the arc HP is 65°, and there's a relationship between the arc and the segment NJ through some geometric property. But I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not requiring us to calculate it numerically, but there's a geometric relation. Let me think again about FL = 24.

If FL = 24, and FL is a segment from F to L, and since F is on the circle with radius 24, then FL could be equal to the radius. For example, if L is on the circle, then FL would be the distance between two points on the circle, but FL is given as 24, which is the radius. So maybe FL is a radius? Or maybe FL is a tangent?

Wait, if L is outside the circle, then FL could be a tangent. But if FL is a tangent, then FL² = power of L. But we need more info.

Alternatively, since L is the intersection of MK and GF, and with the right angle at L, maybe triangle GLK is a right triangle with legs LG and LK, and hypotenuse GK. But without knowing the lengths of these segments, it's hard to proceed.

But since FL = 24, and F is on the circle, perhaps FL is equal to the radius? Or maybe FL is the same as the radius? If FL = 24, and the radius is 24, then maybe L is a point such that FL is a radius. But without knowing where L is, it's unclear.

At this point, I think the most plausible answer is B.32, since our calculation gives approximately 34.14, which is closest to B.32. However, I need to verify if there's a mistake in assumptions.

Wait, let me double-check the assumption that the radius is 24. If the problem actually has a radius of 2.0, then HJ=48 is impossible. Therefore, the only way HJ=48 is possible is if the radius is 24. Hence, the calculation for NJ is 24(1 + cos65°), which is approximately 34.14. Since this is closest to 32 (option B), I'll choose B.

Final Answer: B

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the given geometry problem, we begin by analyzing the provided geometric constraints and leveraging the relationships among the points and the circle.

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Geometric Setup**

We are told that all the points $ F, G, H, J, K, P $ lie on a circle centered at $ M $, with a certain radius. Additionally, several other geometric constraints are specified, including:

- $ \text{PointLiesOnLine}(L, \text{Line}(M, K)) $
- $ \text{PointLiesOnLine}(L, \text{Line}(G, F)) $
- $ \text{PointLiesOnLine}(N, \text{Line}(H, J)) $
- $ \text{PointLiesOnLine}(N, \text{Line}(M, P)) $
- Several points lie on the circle $ \odot M $: $ P, H, G, J, K, F $

These imply that $ L $ is the intersection of lines $ MK $ and $ GF $, while $ N $ is the intersection of lines $ HJ $ and $ MP $. Furthermore, there are perpendicularity conditions:

- $ \angle GLK = 90^\circ $
- $ \angle PNJ = 90^\circ $

We are also given:

- $ FL = 24 $
- $ HJ = 48 $
- $ \overset{\frown}{HP} = 65^\circ $

And we are asked to find $ NJ $, with the answer choices being:

**A. 24**  
**B. 32**  
**C. 48**  
**D. 65**

---

### **Step 2: Interpreting the Radius and Chord Lengths**

It's crucial to interpret the **circle radius** correctly. Initially, it appears that the circle has a radius of $ 2.0 $, but this creates a contradiction:

- The longest possible chord in a circle of radius $ 2.0 $ is $ 2 \times 2.0 = 4.0 $, but the problem states $ HJ = 48 $, which is far greater than this maximum chord length.

This indicates a **typographical error**, and the radius must be significantly larger. By examining the context and logical consistency, we conclude that the **correct radius is 24**, which allows the chord $ HJ = 48 $ to be valid (i.e., the maximum possible chord length in a circle of radius 24 is 48).

Thus, the circle has a **radius $ r = 24 $**.

---

### **Step 3: Placing Points on the Coordinate Plane**

Let’s fix the circle with center at the origin $ M = (0, 0) $, and radius $ r = 24 $.

- Place point $ H = (-24, 0) $, and point $ J = (24, 0) $, so that segment $ HJ $ becomes the **diameter** of the circle.
- Therefore, the center $ M $ lies midway between $ H $ and $ J $, and the segment $ HJ $ is a straight line through the center.

Let’s denote point $ N $ as a point on the line $ HJ $, i.e., the x-axis. Depending on whether $ N $ lies between $ H $ and $ J $ or outside, the power of point $ N $ with respect to the circle changes accordingly.

However, the critical observation is that the **arc $ \overset{\frown}{HP} = 65^\circ $** gives us the **central angle** between points $ H $ and $ P $, and thus the direction of point $ P $ on the circle.

---

### **Step 4: Using the Central Angle to Determine Coordinates of Point $ P $**

The central angle between $ H $ and $ P $ is $ 65^\circ $, so the angular displacement from $ H $ to $ P $ is 65 degrees counterclockwise. Since $ H $ is at $ (-24, 0) $, this places point $ P $ at an angle of $ 180^\circ + 65^\circ = 245^\circ $ from the positive x-axis.

The coordinates of point $ P $ are therefore:

$$
P = (24\cos(245^\circ), 24\sin(245^\circ))
$$

$$
\cos(245^\circ) = \cos(180^\circ + 65^\circ) = -\cos(65^\circ), \quad 
\sin(245^\circ) = \sin(180^\circ + 65^\circ) = -\sin(65^\circ)
$$

So,

$$
P = (-24\cos(65^\circ), -24\sin(65^\circ))
$$

Now, since $ N $ lies on the line $ HJ $ (the x-axis), and the segment $ NP $ is **perpendicular to** segment $ NJ $, it follows that line $ NP $ is **vertical**, and hence point $ P $ must share the same x-coordinate as point $ N $.

That is, the x-coordinate of $ N $ is equal to the x-coordinate of $ P $, which is:

$$
x_N = -24\cos(65^\circ)
$$

So, the coordinates of $ N $ are:

$$
N = (-24\cos(65^\circ), 0)
$$

---

### **Step 5: Finding Segment $ NJ $**

Recall that:

- $ J = (24, 0) $
- $ N = (-24\cos(65^\circ), 0) $

Then, the distance $ NJ $ is simply the absolute difference of the x-coordinates:

$$
NJ = 24 - (-24\cos(65^\circ)) = 24 + 24\cos(65^\circ)
$$

Factor out 24:

$$
NJ = 24(1 + \cos(65^\circ))
$$

Now, we evaluate this expression numerically:

- $ \cos(65^\circ) \approx 0.4226 $
- So, $ 1 + \cos(65^\circ) \approx 1.4226 $
- Therefore:

$$
NJ \approx 24 \times 1.4226 \approx 34.14
$$

---

### **Step 6: Matching with Answer Choices**

The computed value of $ NJ \approx 34.14 $ is closest to **Option B: 32**.

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{B}
