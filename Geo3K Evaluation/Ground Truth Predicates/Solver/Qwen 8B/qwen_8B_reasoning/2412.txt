Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a rectangle JKLM and a rhombus MLPR. The angles ∠JKM and ∠RMP are congruent, with measure 55 degrees each. Also, the measure of ∠MRP is 70 degrees. We need to find the measure of ∠KML. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let me visualize the figure. Since JKLM is a rectangle, all its angles are right angles (90 degrees). So, points J, K, L, M form a rectangle. Now, there's also a rhombus MLPR. Rhombus has all sides equal and opposite angles equal, and the diagonals bisect the angles. But I need to figure out how these shapes are connected.

Let me sketch mentally. Rectangle JKLM – so maybe the order of the letters matters. Typically, rectangles are labeled in order, so J-K-L-M would make a rectangle with sides JK, KL, LM, and MJ. Then, the rhombus is MLPR. Wait, rhombus MLPR – that means the vertices are M, L, P, R? So connecting those points forms a rhombus. So point P and R are somewhere such that MLPR is a rhombus.

So, since ML is a side of both the rectangle and the rhombus. In rectangle JKLM, ML is one of the vertical sides if it's oriented normally. Wait, but depending on how it's drawn, but usually, rectangles have length and width. Let me assume standard labeling where J is top-left, K is top-right, L is bottom-right, M is bottom-left, making the rectangle. So, then ML would be the left side of the rectangle? Wait, no. If J is top-left, K top-right, L bottom-right, M bottom-left. Then sides are JK (top), KL (right), LM (bottom), and MJ (left). So ML is the bottom side from M to L, which is horizontal. Wait, but ML is part of the rectangle as well as part of the rhombus MLPR. So rhombus MLPR has sides ML, LP, PR, and RM. So ML is one side, then LP next, etc.

Since MLPR is a rhombus, all sides are equal. Therefore, ML = LP = PR = RM. Also, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. Also, adjacent angles are supplementary. 

Now, the problem states that angle JMK is congruent to angle RMP. Given that m∠JKM = 55°, so ∠JKM is at point K between J, K, M. Wait, angle JKM is at point K? Wait, angle JMK would be at point M? Wait, no. Angle notation: ∠JKM is at point K. Because the middle letter is the vertex. So ∠JKM is at point K, formed by points J, K, M. Similarly, ∠RMP is at point M, formed by points R, M, P.

Also, given that m∠JKM = 55°, so that angle at K is 55°, and since ∠JKM ≅ ∠RMP, so ∠RMP is also 55°. However, the problem also says that m∠MRP = 70°. So angle at R, between M, R, P is 70°. Need to find m∠KML. Which angle is that?

∠KML is at point M, between K, M, L. Since K, M, L are points of the rectangle. Since JKLM is a rectangle, KM is a diagonal from K to M. Wait, but wait, in the rectangle, the sides are JK, KL, LM, and MJ. So point M is connected to L and J. Wait, but ∠KML is at point M, between points K, M, L. So that would be the angle between MK and ML. Since ML is a side of the rectangle, which is horizontal (assuming standard orientation), and MK is a diagonal from M to K.

Wait, let me think again. Let me try to get coordinates for clarity. Maybe assigning coordinates will help. Let me place the rectangle JKLM on coordinate plane. Let me assign coordinates:

Let’s suppose point M is at origin (0, 0). Since it's a rectangle, let me define coordinates accordingly. Suppose ML is along x-axis, so point L is at (a, 0) for some a > 0. Point M is (0, 0). Then, since it's a rectangle, moving up from M to J and K. Wait, if ML is horizontal, then JM and KL are vertical. Wait, let me think again.

In rectangle JKLM, consecutive points are J, K, L, M. So edges are JK, KL, LM, and MJ. So starting at J, going to K, then to L, then to M, then back to J. So if I imagine the rectangle, with J at top-left, K at top-right, L at bottom-right, M at bottom-left. Then, sides:

- JK is top side, horizontal.

- KL is right side, vertical.

- LM is bottom side, horizontal.

- MJ is left side, vertical.

Therefore, coordinates can be assigned as follows:

Let me set coordinates:

Let’s take M at (0, 0).

Then, since LM is horizontal, point L is at (l, 0) for some l > 0.

Point J is directly above M, so since MJ is vertical. Wait, if M is at (0, 0), then J would be at (0, h) where h is height of rectangle. Wait, but then KL connects to L. Let me think more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps better to use variables. Let me denote:

Let’s let’s say the rectangle has length and width. Let me assign coordinates:

Let me fix coordinates:

Let me take M(0, 0). Since it's a rectangle, suppose ML is horizontal. So point L is (a, 0). Then, since it's a rectangle, point K is (a, b) because KL is vertical from L(a, 0) up to K(a, b). Then, point J would be (0, b) to complete the rectangle, connecting back to M(0, 0). So:

- J(0, b)

- K(a, b)

- L(a, 0)

- M(0, 0)

This makes sense. So sides:

- JK: from (0, b) to (a, b)

- KL: from (a, b) to (a, 0)

- LM: from (a, 0) to (0, 0)

Wait, no. Wait LM should connect L(a, 0) to M(0, 0)? No, in the rectangle, LM is from L to M. Wait, according to the rectangle order J-K-L-M-J. So after L comes M. So yes, LM is from L(a, 0) to M(0, 0). Wait, but that would mean LM is a horizontal line from L(a, 0) to M(0, 0), which would be leftward. That would make sense. So the rectangle is actually leaning? Or maybe my coordinate assignment is off.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

If the rectangle is J-K-L-M-J, then the sides are:

From J to K, then K to L, then L to M, then M to J. So, for example, if I consider the rectangle with J at top-left, K at top-right, L at bottom-right, M at bottom-left. Then:

- JK is top side,

- KL is right side (from K down to L),

- LM is bottom side (from L to M),

- MJ is left side (from M up to J).

Thus, in coordinates, assuming J is (0, h), K is (w, h), L is (w, 0), and M is (0, 0). So that:

- JK is horizontal from (0, h) to (w, h)

- KL is vertical down from (w, h) to (w, 0)

- LM is horizontal left from (w, 0) to (0, 0)

- MJ is vertical up from (0, 0) to (0, h)

Yes, that works. So with that coordinate system:

Points:

J(0, h), K(w, h), L(w, 0), M(0, 0)

Now, the rhombus is MLPR. So points M(0, 0), L(w, 0), P, R. So MLPR is a rhombus. So ML is one side of the rhombus. Since ML is from M(0,0) to L(w, 0), which is a horizontal segment of length w. Then, since MLPR is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. Therefore, LP, PR, RM must also be length w. Also, the rhombus has opposite sides parallel and equal.

But where are points P and R located?

Since MLPR is a rhombus, the order of the letters implies the connections: M to L, L to P, P to R, R to M. So the rhombus is connected as M-L-P-R-M.

So from point L(w, 0), moving to P, then to R, then back to M(0, 0). To determine coordinates of P and R, we need more info.

Given that angle ∠JKM ≅ ∠RMP, with measure 55°, and ∠MRP = 70°. Let me first find ∠JKM.

Angle JKM is at point K, between points J, K, M. So in terms of coordinates, point K is at (w, h). Points J(0, h), K(w, h), M(0, 0). So ∠JKM is the angle at K between lines KJ and KM.

Vector KJ goes from K(w, h) to J(0, h): direction (-w, 0)

Vector KM goes from K(w, h) to M(0, 0): direction (-w, -h)

So angle between vectors (-w, 0) and (-w, -h). Let me compute this angle.

The formula for angle between two vectors u and v is cosθ = (u · v)/(|u||v|)

Compute the dot product:

(-w)(-w) + (0)(-h) = w² + 0 = w²

|u| = sqrt((-w)^2 + 0^2) = w

|v| = sqrt((-w)^2 + (-h)^2) = sqrt(w² + h²)

Therefore, cosθ = w² / [w * sqrt(w² + h²)] ) = w / sqrt(w² + h²)

But they told us that this angle θ is 55 degrees. So:

cos(55°) = w / sqrt(w² + h²)

Which gives us:

sqrt(w² + h²) = w / cos(55°)

Square both sides:

w² + h² = w² / cos²(55°)

Then rearranged:

h² = w² / cos²(55°) - w² = w² [ 1/cos²(55°) - 1 ] = w² tan²(55° )

Therefore, h = w tan(55° )

So the ratio of height to width of the rectangle is tan(55° ). Interesting.

So that relates h and w. Let's note that.

Now, moving on. We also know that ∠RMP is congruent to ∠JKM, so ∠RMP is also 55°. ∠RMP is at point M between R, M, P. So point R and P are part of the rhombus MLPR.

We also know that ∠MRP is 70°, which is the angle at R between M, R, P.

Our goal is to find ∠KML, which is the angle at M between K, M, L. Wait, point K is (w, h), M is (0, 0), and L is (w, 0). So ∠KML is the angle at M between points K, M, L. So that would be the angle between vectors MK and ML.

Vector MK goes from M(0,0) to K(w, h): direction (w, h)

Vector ML goes from M(0,0) to L(w, 0): direction (w, 0)

So angle between vector (w, h) and (w, 0). Which is the same as angle between (1, h/w) and (1, 0). Let me compute this angle.

Again using dot product:

cosθ = ( (w)(w) + (h)(0) ) / ( |MK| * |ML| )

Which is (w²) / [ sqrt(w² + h²) * sqrt(w²) ) ] = w² / [ w * sqrt(w² + h²) ) ] = same as before, which equals cos(θ) = w / sqrt(w² + h² )

Wait, but earlier we had that cos(55°) = w / sqrt(w² + h² ), which was from angle JKM. So this suggests that ∠KML is 55°, but that seems conflicting with the answer choices, unless I'm missing something here.

Wait, but hold on. Wait, ∠KML is the angle between MK and ML. From above, we saw that cos(theta) = w / sqrt(w² + h² ) which equals cos(55°), meaning theta is 55°, implying that ∠KML is 55°, but 55° isn't among the answer choices. Wait, but the answer choices are A. 35, B. 70, C. 110, D. 140. Hmm. So either I made a mistake here, or there's another consideration.

Wait, but maybe I confused the angle. Let me re-express.

Wait, ∠KML is at point M between K, M, L. So, in terms of triangle KML. But since JKLM is a rectangle, ML is horizontal from M(0,0) to L(w, 0). And MK is from M(0,0) to K(w, h). So the angle between ML (which is along positive x-axis) and MK (going to (w,h)) is indeed the angle whose cosine is w / sqrt(w² + h² ), which we said is 55°, so ∠KML would be 55°, but that's not an option. Therefore, there must be an error in reasoning.

Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the angle. Let me double-check. The angle between MK and ML is ∠KML. Let me think of triangle KML. In triangle KML, points K(w, h), M(0, 0), L(w, 0). So triangle with base ML of length w, and side MK of length sqrt(w² + h² ), and side KL... Wait, but KL is vertical from (w, 0) to (w, h). Wait, but in triangle KML, sides are ML (length w), MK (sqrt(w² + h² )), and KL? Wait, no. Triangle KML has sides:

- MK: from M to K

- ML: from M to L

- and KL: from K to L? Wait, no. Wait, triangle KML is formed by points K, M, L. So sides are KM, ML, and KL? Wait, no. Wait, connecting K, M, L. So sides are KM, ML, and KL? Wait, no. From K to M, M to L, and L to K. Wait, but L to K is the side of the rectangle, which is vertical from L(w, 0) to K(w, h). So length h. So triangle KML has sides:

- KM: sqrt(w² + h² )

- ML: w

- KL: h

But angle at M is between KM and ML. So using law of cosines:

KL² = KM² + ML² - 2*KM*ML*cos(angle KML)

So h² = (w² + h²) + w² - 2 * sqrt(w² + h² ) * w * cos(angle KML)

Wait, simplifying:

h² = w² + h² + w² - 2 * sqrt(...) * w * cos(...)

Subtracting h² from both sides:

0 = 2w² - 2 * sqrt(w² + h² ) * w * cos(angle KML)

Divide both sides by 2w:

0 = w - sqrt(w² + h² ) * cos(angle KML)

Therefore:

sqrt(w² + h² ) * cos(angle KML) = w

Which leads to cos(angle KML) = w / sqrt(w² + h² ) which is same as before, leading to angle KML being arccos(w / sqrt(w² + h² )) which equals 55°, as established earlier. So according to this, ∠KML is 55°, but that's not an option. Hence, contradiction arises. Therefore, my previous assumption must be wrong.

Wait, but why? Where did I go wrong?

Ah! Wait, the problem says that ∠JKM ≅ ∠RMP. Earlier, I considered ∠JKM as 55°, but maybe there's confusion about which angle that is.

Wait, ∠JKM is at point K, between J, K, M. Earlier calculation showed that angle is 55°, leading to relation between h and w. But maybe there's something else about the rhombus MLPR that affects this?

Because the problem also mentions rhombus MLPR and gives information about ∠MRP = 70°. Perhaps my previous analysis didn't account for that. So maybe I need to incorporate the rhombus properties.

Let me recall that in rhombus MLPR, all sides are equal. So ML = LP = PR = RM. Also, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. Also, adjacent angles are supplementary.

Moreover, ∠MRP is given as 70°. Let me focus on triangle MRP. Wait, point R is part of the rhombus MLPR. Let me try to find coordinates for P and R.

Since MLPR is a rhombus, with sides ML, LP, PR, RM. So ML is from M(0,0) to L(w, 0). Then, from L(w, 0), moving to P. Since it's a rhombus, LP must be equal in length to ML, i.e., length w. Also, direction from L to P depends on the shape of the rhombus.

But without knowing specific angles, it's hard to tell. However, we have information about angles involving point R and P.

Given that ∠MRP = 70°, which is the angle at R between points M, R, P.

Additionally, ∠RMP = 55°, which is the angle at M between R, M, P.

So in triangle MRP, we have angle at M (∠RMP) = 55°, angle at R (∠MRP) = 70°, so we can find the third angle at P.

Sum of angles in triangle is 180°, so ∠MPR = 180 - 55 - 70 = 55°. So triangle MRP has angles 55°, 70°, 55°, making it an isosceles triangle with sides MR = PR.

Wait, in triangle MRP, angles at M and P are equal (both 55°), so sides opposite them are equal. Therefore, side RP (opposite ∠M) equals side MR (opposite ∠P)? Wait, no. Wait, in triangle MRP:

- ∠ at M: 55°, opposite side RP

- ∠ at R: 70°, opposite side MP

- ∠ at P: 55°, opposite side MR

Therefore, since ∠M and ∠P are equal (both 55°), their opposite sides are equal: RP = MR.

But in rhombus MLPR, all sides are equal. So MR is one of the sides of the rhombus. Since MLPR is a rhombus, MR is a side. Therefore, MR = ML = LP = PR = RM. Wait, but in the rhombus, sides are ML, LP, PR, RM. So MR is a diagonal? Wait, no. Wait, MLPR is a rhombus, so the sides are ML, LP, PR, and RM. Therefore, MR is a diagonal of the rhombus, not a side. Wait, because the vertices are M, L, P, R. So sides are ML, LP, PR, RM. Thus, MR is a diagonal connecting M to R. Therefore, in the rhombus, the diagonals are MP and LR.

But in triangle MRP, we have sides MR, RP, and MP. Wait, but since MLPR is a rhombus, MR is a diagonal, and RP is a side of the rhombus. Wait, but earlier conclusion that in triangle MRP, RP = MR? Wait, if ∠M and ∠P are equal, then sides opposite them are equal. So side opposite ∠M is RP, and side opposite ∠P is MR. Therefore, RP = MR.

But in the rhombus, all sides are equal. So RP is a side of the rhombus (since RP is from R to P, which is a side of the rhombus). Wait, no: MLPR is the rhombus, so sides are ML, LP, PR, and RM. So RP is a side? Wait, from R to P? Wait, the order is M -> L -> P -> R -> M. So sides are ML, LP, PR, RM. So yes, PR is a side of the rhombus. Therefore, PR is equal to ML, which is length w. Also, MR is a diagonal of the rhombus. Wait, but according to triangle MRP, PR = MR. So PR = MR, which would imply that the diagonal MR is equal to the side PR of the rhombus. But in a rhombus, the diagonals are generally longer than the sides unless it's a square. So this might give us some relations.

Let me denote the rhombus MLPR with sides of length s = ML = w. So ML = w. Then, in the rhombus, diagonals can be computed based on angles. Alternatively, since we have triangle MRP with sides MR, RP, and MP, and knowing that RP = s = w, and MR is a diagonal. Let me try to relate this.

In rhombus MLPR, diagonals intersect at right angles and bisect each other. Also, the diagonals divide the rhombus into triangles. However, without knowing specific angles, it's complex. But we can use the triangle MRP.

From triangle MRP, we have:

∠MRP = 70°, ∠RMP = 55°, ∠MPR = 55°, and sides:

- RP = MR (as per above)

But RP is a side of the rhombus, which is length w.

Therefore, MR = RP = w. But MR is the diagonal of the rhombus. Let me recall that in a rhombus, the length of the diagonals can be related to the side length and angles.

Let me denote the rhombus MLPR with side length s = w. Let’s call the diagonals d1 and d2. In a rhombus, the diagonals satisfy:

d1 = 2s sin(theta/2), d2 = 2s cos(theta/2), where theta is one of the internal angles.

Wait, alternatively, the diagonals split the angles of the rhombus. For example, if one angle is α, then the diagonals split it into two angles of α/2. The lengths of the diagonals can be expressed as d1 = 2s sin(α/2), d2 = 2s cos(α/2). But I might need to verify.

Alternatively, using the law of cosines on the triangles formed by the diagonals. For instance, in rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors. So, if we consider half of the rhombus, forming a right triangle with legs d1/2 and d2/2, hypotenuse s.

So:

(d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2 = s^2 → d1² + d2² = 4s².

Also, the area of the rhombus is (d1*d2)/2.

But perhaps more useful is relating the angles of the rhombus to its diagonals. For example, if one of the angles of the rhombus is β, then the diagonals satisfy:

tan(β/2) = (d1/2)/(d2/2) = d1/d2.

But I need to relate this to our case.

However, in our case, we have triangle MRP where MR is a diagonal of the rhombus, and RP is a side. Wait, earlier we concluded that in triangle MRP, MR = RP = w. So MR is equal to the side of the rhombus, which is w. But MR is a diagonal of the rhombus. So in the rhombus, the diagonal MR equals the side length w. Let me denote the side length of the rhombus as s = w.

So, for a rhombus with side length s, one of its diagonals is equal to s. Let's find the angles of the rhombus.

In a rhombus, the length of a diagonal can be expressed as d = 2s sin(θ/2), where θ is one of the internal angles. If one of the diagonals is equal to s, then:

s = 2s sin(θ/2) → 1 = 2 sin(θ/2) → sin(θ/2) = 1/2 → θ/2 = 30° → θ = 60°.

Therefore, one of the internal angles of the rhombus is 60°, and the adjacent angle is 120°, since consecutive angles in a rhombus are supplementary.

So, the rhombus MLPR has angles of 60° and 120°. Now, which angle corresponds to which?

Looking at triangle MRP, we had angles at M and P equal to 55°, which might correspond to certain angles in the rhombus. However, this seems conflicting with the 60° and 120° angles. Wait, but maybe I need to clarify which diagonal we're talking about.

Earlier, we assumed that MR is a diagonal of the rhombus MLPR. Let me confirm that.

Rhombus MLPR has vertices M, L, P, R. The diagonals are MP and LR. So MR is not a diagonal; it's a side? Wait, no. Wait, from M to R is a connection between two non-consecutive vertices? Let me see:

Vertices are M, L, P, R. So the diagonals are MP and LR. So MR is not a diagonal; it's a side only if R is adjacent to M. Wait, but in the rhombus MLPR, the sides are ML, LP, PR, and RM. So RM is a side, connecting R to M. Therefore, MR is a side of the rhombus. Wait, no. Wait, the sides are ML, LP, PR, and RM. So RM is a side, which is the same as MR. So MR is a side of the rhombus. Therefore, in the rhombus, all sides are equal, so MR = ML = LP = PR = RM = w. But earlier, in triangle MRP, we have that MR = RP, which are both sides of the rhombus. So that holds true, since both are length w. So that checks out.

But earlier, I thought that in the rhombus, one of the diagonals is equal to the side length. But if MR is a side, then the diagonals are MP and LR. Let me calculate their lengths.

Let me consider the rhombus MLPR with sides of length w. Let me try to find the lengths of diagonals MP and LR.

In a rhombus, the diagonals can be calculated using the formulas:

d1 = 2s sin(θ/2)

d2 = 2s cos(θ/2)

Where θ is one of the internal angles. As previously determined, if one of the diagonals equals the side length, then we have θ = 60°, leading to one diagonal being 2s sin(30°) = 2s*(1/2) = s. So that matches the scenario where one diagonal equals the side length.

But in this case, which diagonal is equal to the side length? It depends on which angle is chosen. Let's assume that one of the internal angles of the rhombus is 60°, and the other is 120°. Let's say that at vertex L, the angle is 60°, and at vertex P, it's 120°, etc.

But how does this relate to triangle MRP?

In triangle MRP, we have sides MR = w, RP = w, and MP. So it's an isosceles triangle with MR = RP = w, and angle at R being 70°, angle at M being 55°, angle at P being 55°. Using the Law of Sines on triangle MRP:

sin(∠M)/RP = sin(∠R)/MP = sin(∠P)/MR

Wait, ∠M is 55°, opposite side RP = w.

∠R is 70°, opposite side MP.

∠P is 55°, opposite side MR = w.

So applying the Law of Sines:

sin(55°)/w = sin(70°)/MP = sin(55°)/w

So this implies that MP = w * sin(70°)/sin(55°)

Calculating this value numerically:

sin(70°) ≈ 0.9397

sin(55°) ≈ 0.8192

So MP ≈ w * 0.9397 / 0.8192 ≈ w * 1.147

So MP ≈ 1.147w

But MP is also a diagonal of the rhombus MLPR. Earlier, we said that one of the diagonals is equal to the side length w. Wait, but MP is a diagonal. If one of the diagonals is equal to w, then MP could be that diagonal.

But earlier, we had that one of the diagonals equals the side length w. So if MP is one of the diagonals, then MP = w. But according to the Law of Sines, MP ≈ 1.147w, which contradicts unless 1.147w = w, which is not possible. Therefore, there's inconsistency here. This suggests that my earlier assumption about which diagonal equals the side length may be incorrect.

Alternative approach: Let me use the fact that in rhombus MLPR, the diagonals bisect the angles. So, for example, if we consider the diagonals MP and LR, they bisect the angles at each vertex.

Let me consider angle at vertex L. In rhombus MLPR, the angle at L is formed by sides ML and LP. Since MLPR is a rhombus, adjacent angles are supplementary. If we can find the measure of one angle, we can find others.

But how to relate this to the given angles in triangle MRP?

Alternatively, since we know in triangle MRP, we have angles at M = 55°, at R = 70°, at P = 55°, and sides MR = RP = w.

Let me consider the position of point R in the rhombus. Since MLPR is a rhombus, and ML is from M(0,0) to L(w, 0). Let me attempt to find coordinates of P and R.

Assume that the rhombus MLPR has sides of length w. Starting from point M(0, 0), moving to L(w, 0). Then, from L(w, 0), moving to P. The direction from L to P should be such that LP has length w and the angle at L is determined by the rhombus angles.

But without knowing the exact angles, it's challenging. However, since we know about triangle MRP, perhaps we can find coordinates of R and P.

Let me consider vector approaches. Let me denote vectors for the rhombus.

In rhombus MLPR, since all sides are equal and opposite sides are parallel. So vector ML is from M to L: (w, 0). Vector LP should be equal to vector MR? No, in a rhombus, adjacent sides are vectors that are not necessarily equal, but all sides have the same magnitude.

Alternatively, since MLPR is a rhombus, the vector from M to L is ML = (w, 0). The next side is LP, which should be equal in length and direction to MR? No, in a rhombus, consecutive sides are vectors with the same magnitude but different directions.

Alternatively, since MLPR is a rhombus, the vector from L to P should be equal to the vector from M to R. Because in a parallelogram (and rhombus is a type of parallelogram), opposite sides are equal and parallel. So vector LP = vector MR.

Let me write this: vector LP = vector MR.

Vector LP is P - L.

Vector MR is R - M = R - (0, 0) = R.

So P - L = R → P = L + R.

Wait, but this might not be helpful without knowing R.

Alternatively, since MLPR is a rhombus, the midpoint of diagonals coincide. The diagonals are MP and LR. Their midpoints must be the same.

Midpoint of MP: ((M_x + P_x)/2, (M_y + P_y)/2)

Midpoint of LR: ((L_x + R_x)/2, (L_y + R_y)/2)

These midpoints are equal, so:

(M_x + P_x)/2 = (L_x + R_x)/2 ⇒ M_x + P_x = L_x + R_x

Similarly for y-coordinates: M_y + P_y = L_y + R_y

Since M is (0, 0), L is (w, 0). So:

For x-coordinate: 0 + P_x = w + R_x ⇒ P_x = w + R_x

For y-coordinate: 0 + P_y = 0 + R_y ⇒ P_y = R_y

But this introduces too many variables. Maybe I need to use the information about angles.

Let me consider that in triangle MRP, we have sides MR = w, RP = w, and MP ≈ 1.147w as calculated earlier. Also, in the rhombus, the diagonals MP and LR. If MP is one diagonal, then its length is approximately 1.147w. But we also know that in a rhombus, the sum of squares of diagonals equals 4 times the square of a side:

d1² + d2² = 4s²

Here, s = w, and one diagonal is d1 = MP ≈ 1.147w, so:

(1.147w)² + d2² = 4w²

Calculate 1.147² ≈ 1.316, so:

1.316w² + d2² = 4w² ⇒ d2² = 4w² - 1.316w² = 2.684w² ⇒ d2 ≈ 1.639w

So the other diagonal is ≈1.639w.

But how does this help us?

Alternatively, let me think about the angles of the rhombus. Since in triangle MRP, we have angles of 55°, 70°, 55°, and sides MR = RP = w, MP ≈ 1.147w. In the rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. So, for example, diagonal MP bisects the angles at M and P.

Wait, in the rhombus, each diagonal bisects the angles. So, if diagonal MP bisects the angles at M and P, then the angle at M in the rhombus is split into two equal parts by diagonal MP.

But in our case, at point M, the angle of the rhombus is... Let me think. The rhombus has four angles: at M, L, P, R. Let me denote them as follows:

At point M: angle between sides ML and MR. At point L: angle between ML and LP. At point P: angle between LP and PR. At point R: angle between PR and RM.

Since the rhombus has opposite angles equal, and adjacent angles supplementary.

Now, in triangle MRP, we have angle at M is 55°. But this angle is not necessarily the same as the angle at M in the rhombus. Wait, ∠RMP is the angle at M between R, M, P. But in the rhombus, the angle at M is between sides ML and MR. So ∠RMP is part of the angle at M in the rhombus. Wait, but in the rhombus, the angle at M is between ML and MR. So ∠RMP is that angle itself? Yes, because at point M, the sides are ML and MR, and ∠RMP is the angle between them. Wait, but in the rhombus, the angle at M is between ML and MR, which is exactly ∠RMP. So ∠RMP is equal to the angle at M of the rhombus. Given that ∠RMP = 55°, so the angle at M of the rhombus is 55°. Therefore, since consecutive angles in a rhombus are supplementary, the angle at L would be 180° - 55° = 125°, and similarly for other angles.

Wait, but earlier we had from triangle MRP that the diagonal MP splits the angle at M into two parts. Wait, no—wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. So if the angle at M is 55°, then diagonal MP bisects it into two angles of 27.5° each.

But in triangle MRP, we have ∠RMP = 55°, which would be the entire angle at M of the rhombus. So this suggests that the diagonal MP does not bisect the angle at M, which contradicts the property of rhombus diagonals. Therefore, there must be an error in assumptions.

Wait, this indicates that my assumption that ∠RMP is the angle at M of the rhombus is incorrect. Let me re-examine.

The angle ∠RMP is at point M, between R, M, P. In the rhombus MLPR, the sides at M are ML and MR. So ∠RMP is the angle between ML and MR, which is indeed the angle at M of the rhombus. Therefore, this angle is 55°, which means the angle at M of the rhombus is 55°, hence the adjacent angle at L is 180° - 55° = 125°. Then, since diagonals bisect the angles, the diagonal MP would bisect the 55° angle at M into two 27.5° angles.

But in triangle MRP, we have ∠RMP = 55°, which is the full angle at M. How does this fit with the diagonal bisecting it? It seems like there's a contradiction, suggesting an error in my understanding.

Wait, maybe the diagonal MP is not the one that bisects the angle at M. Wait, in a rhombus, each diagonal bisects the angles at the vertices it connects. So diagonal MP connects M to P, so it should bisect the angles at M and P. But if the angle at M is 55°, then it should be split into two 27.5° angles by diagonal MP. But in triangle MRP, the angle at M is 55°, which suggests that MP is not the bisector. This contradiction implies that my earlier assumption about the angle at M being 55° is incorrect.

Wait, but the problem states that ∠JKM ≅ ∠RMP, and m∠JKM = 55°. So ∠RMP is also 55°, which is the angle at M of the rhombus. This suggests that the angle at M of the rhombus is 55°, leading to the contradiction with the diagonal bisecting it. Therefore, there must be a mistake in assuming that ∠RMP is the angle at M of the rhombus. Let me re-examine the definition of ∠RMP.

∠RMP is the angle at M between R, M, P. In the rhombus MLPR, the sides at M are ML and MR. So ∠RMP is indeed the angle between ML and MR, which is the angle at M of the rhombus. Hence, it should be 55°, leading to the contradiction with the diagonal bisecting it. This suggests that my earlier calculation about the relationship between h and w might be incorrect, or there's another factor at play.

Let me revisit the earlier part where I calculated h in terms of w. We had from ∠JKM = 55°, leading to h = w tan(55°). Let me compute tan(55°):

tan(55°) ≈ 1.4281

So h ≈ 1.4281w.

Now, let's try to use the information about the rhombus MLPR. Let me consider the coordinates of points P and R.

Since MLPR is a rhombus, and we know ML is from M(0, 0) to L(w, 0). Let me try to find coordinates for P and R.

Let me denote vector ML as (w, 0). In a rhombus, the adjacent sides at L are ML and LP. Since ML is from L to M, but in the rhombus, the sides at L are ML and LP. Wait, the rhombus has sides ML, LP, PR, and RM. So at point L, the sides are ML and LP. Since ML is from L to M, and LP is from L to P. So vector LP should be equal in length to ML, which is w, and the angle between ML and LP is the angle at L of the rhombus, which we previously thought was 125°, but this led to contradictions.

Let me instead use the angle at M of the rhombus being 55°, and try to find coordinates.

At point M, the sides are ML (from M to L) and MR (from M to R). The angle between these two sides is 55°. So vector ML is (w, 0) as before. Vector MR is from M(0,0) to R(x, y). The angle between ML and MR is 55°, so:

cos(55°) = (ML · MR) / (|ML| |MR|)

ML · MR = (w, 0) · (x, y) = w*x + 0*y = wx

|ML| = w

|MR| = sqrt(x² + y²)

So:

wx / (w * sqrt(x² + y²)) = cos(55°)

Simplify:

x / sqrt(x² + y²) = cos(55°)

Which implies that x = sqrt(x² + y²) * cos(55°)

Squaring both sides:

x² = (x² + y²) cos²(55°)

Rearranged:

x² = x² cos²(55°) + y² cos²(55°)

Bring terms together:

x² (1 - cos²(55°)) = y² cos²(55°)

Using identity 1 - cos² = sin²:

x² sin²(55°) = y² cos²(55°)

Take square root:

x sin(55°) = ±y cos(55°)

Thus:

y = x tan(55°)

So the coordinates of R(x, y) lie along the line y = x tan(55°). Since R is a vertex of the rhombus, and MLPR is a rhombus, we need to determine x and y such that all sides are equal.

Additionally, since MLPR is a rhombus, the length of MR should equal ML, which is w. So |MR| = sqrt(x² + y²) = w.

But y = x tan(55°), so substitute:

sqrt(x² + x² tan²(55°)) = w → x sqrt(1 + tan²(55°)) = w

But 1 + tan²(θ) = sec²(θ), so:

x sec(55°) = w → x = w cos(55°)

Thus, x = w cos(55°), and y = x tan(55°) = w cos(55°) tan(55°) = w sin(55°)

Therefore, coordinates of R are (w cos(55°), w sin(55°))

So R is at (w cos(55°), w sin(55°))

Now, since MLPR is a rhombus, the vector from L to P should be equal to the vector from M to R. Because in a parallelogram (rhombus is a parallelogram), opposite sides are equal and parallel.

Vector MR is R - M = (w cos(55°), w sin(55°)) - (0, 0) = (w cos(55°), w sin(55°))

Vector LP is P - L. Since LP should equal MR, so P = L + MR.

L is at (w, 0), so P = (w + w cos(55°), 0 + w sin(55°)) = (w(1 + cos(55°)), w sin(55°))

So coordinates of P are (w(1 + cos(55°)), w sin(55°))

Now, we have coordinates for R and P. Let me verify if this satisfies the condition about ∠MRP = 70°.

Point M is (0, 0), R is (w cos(55°), w sin(55°)), P is (w(1 + cos(55°)), w sin(55°)).

We need to compute ∠MRP, which is the angle at R between points M, R, P.

To compute this angle, we can use vectors. At point R, vectors RM and RP.

Vector RM = M - R = (0 - w cos(55°), 0 - w sin(55°)) = (-w cos(55°), -w sin(55°))

Vector RP = P - R = [w(1 + cos(55°)) - w cos(55°), w sin(55°) - w sin(55°)] = (w, 0)

So vector RP is (w, 0), and vector RM is (-w cos(55°), -w sin(55°))

Now, the angle between vectors RM and RP is ∠MRP, which is given as 70°. Let's compute this angle using the dot product.

Dot product of RM and RP:

(-w cos(55°))(w) + (-w sin(55°))(0) = -w² cos(55°) + 0 = -w² cos(55°)

Magnitude of RM: sqrt[ (-w cos(55°))^2 + (-w sin(55°))^2 ] = w sqrt(cos²(55°) + sin²(55°)) = w

Magnitude of RP: sqrt(w² + 0) = w

So cos(θ) = (dot product) / (|RM| |RP|) = (-w² cos(55°)) / (w * w) = -cos(55°)

Thus, cos(θ) = -cos(55°), which implies θ = 180° - 55° = 125°. But the problem states that ∠MRP = 70°, which conflicts with this calculation. This suggests a contradiction, indicating an error in assumptions.

Wait, this implies that with the current setup, ∠MRP is 125°, but the problem says it is 70°. This means our assumption about the placement of point R is incorrect.

What went wrong? Let me review. We assumed that vector LP = vector MR, which is true in a parallelogram. But since MLPR is a rhombus, it is a parallelogram, so this should hold. However, the resulting angle ∠MRP is 125°, not 70°, as given. This suggests that there's a miscalculation or misassumption.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation of the angle at R.

Vectors at R are RM and RP.

Vector RM is from R to M: M - R = (-w cos(55°), -w sin(55°))

Vector RP is from R to P: P - R = (w, 0)

The angle between these vectors is ∠MRP. Let me calculate the angle between these vectors.

The formula is:

cosθ = (RM • RP) / (|RM| |RP|)

As computed, RM • RP = -w² cos(55°)

|RM| = w, |RP| = w

Thus, cosθ = -cos(55°) => θ = 180° - 55° = 125°, as before.

But the problem states that ∠MRP = 70°, so this is inconsistent. Hence, there must be an error in the assumption that vector LP = vector MR. Perhaps the rhombus is not constructed in the way I thought.

Wait, in a rhombus, adjacent sides are vectors that are not necessarily equal, but all sides are equal in length. However, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. So in rhombus MLPR, vector ML should be equal to vector PR, and vector LP equal to vector MR. Wait, let me re-express.

In a parallelogram, vector ML should equal vector PR, and vector LP should equal vector MR.

Wait, let me redefine. In parallelogram MLPR, the opposite sides are equal and parallel. So:

- ML is equal and parallel to PR

- LP is equal and parallel to MR

So vector ML = vector PR, and vector LP = vector MR.

Vector ML is L - M = (w, 0) - (0, 0) = (w, 0)

Vector PR is R - P. So PR = R - P = ML = (w, 0). Therefore, R - P = (w, 0) => P = R - (w, 0) = (R_x - w, R_y)

Also, vector LP = vector MR.

Vector LP is P - L = (P_x - w, P_y - 0) = (P_x - w, P_y)

Vector MR is R - M = R - (0, 0) = (R_x, R_y)

So P_x - w = R_x and P_y = R_y

Thus, P_x = R_x + w, P_y = R_y

From earlier, P = R - (w, 0), so P_x = R_x - w, P_y = R_y. But from LP = MR, we have P_x = R_x + w, P_y = R_y. These two expressions for P_x must be consistent: R_x - w = R_x + w => -w = w, which implies w = 0, impossible. Hence, contradiction.

This suggests that my initial assumption about the parallelogram relationships is incorrect. Maybe the order of the rhombus vertices is different? The problem states "M L P R is a rhombus", which means the vertices are M, L, P, R in order. So the sides are ML, LP, PR, and RM. Thus, in this case, vector ML should be equal to vector PR, and vector LP equal to vector MR.

But as shown, this leads to inconsistencies. Perhaps the issue is in the direction of the vectors? Let me try again.

Vector ML is from M to L: L - M = (w, 0)

Vector PR is from P to R: R - P

For ML and PR to be equal and parallel, R - P = ML = (w, 0) → R = P + (w, 0)

Vector LP is from L to P: P - L

Vector MR is from M to R: R - M

For LP and MR to be equal and parallel, P - L = R - M → P - L = R - M

But since R = P + (w, 0), substituting:

P - L = (P + (w, 0)) - M → P - L = P + (w, 0) - (0, 0) → P - L = P + (w, 0) → Subtract P: -L = (w, 0) → L = (-w, 0). But L is at (w, 0) in our coordinate system. Contradiction. Hence, this suggests that the assumption is incorrect.

This implies that my initial approach to defining the rhombus is flawed. Perhaps the rhombus is not a parallelogram in the way I thought, or the order of the vertices is different. Alternatively, maybe the rhombus is not convex, or the points are arranged differently.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the fact that in the rhombus MLPR, the sides ML, LP, PR, and RM are all equal, and use the given angles to find relations.

Given that ∠MRP = 70°, and ∠RMP = 55°, and we need to find ∠KML.

Let me try to use the earlier coordinates, even though it led to a contradiction, and see if there's a way to adjust.

Previously, we had point R at (w cos(55°), w sin(55°)), and P at (w(1 + cos(55°)), w sin(55°)). This gave ∠MRP = 125°, but the problem says it's 70°. So perhaps the angle at R is 70°, which would mean that the actual angle in the calculation is 70°, so there might be a sign error or direction.

Wait, when calculating the angle between vectors RM and RP, we got θ = 125°, but the actual angle ∠MRP is the smaller angle between the two vectors, which could be 180° - 125° = 55°, but that doesn't match the given 70°. Alternatively, perhaps I took the wrong vectors.

Wait, ∠MRP is the angle at R between M, R, P. So it's the angle between RM and RP, but depending on the direction of the vectors. Maybe I should have taken vectors MR and PR instead of RM and RP.

Let me recalculate using vectors MR and PR.

Vector MR is from R to M: M - R = (-w cos(55°), -w sin(55°))

Vector PR is from R to P: P - R = (w, 0)

Wait, this is what I did before. The angle between these vectors is 125°, but the problem says it's 70°. So this suggests that my assumption about the location of R is incorrect.

Maybe the angle at M is not 55°, but something else? Wait, the problem says ∠JKM ≅ ∠RMP, and m∠JKM = 55°, so ∠RMP must also be 55°. But according to the calculation, it leads to a contradiction. This suggests that there is an error in the earlier steps.

Let me go back to the beginning. Perhaps I made a mistake in associating ∠JKM with the angle at K. Let me re-examine that.

∠JKM is at point K, between J, K, M. With J(0, h), K(w, h), M(0, 0). So this angle is between JK and KM.

Vector KJ is from K to J: (0 - w, h - h) = (-w, 0)

Vector KM is from K to M: (0 - w, 0 - h) = (-w, -h)

The angle between these vectors is ∠JKM.

As calculated earlier, this angle is 55°, leading to h = w tan(55°). Let me accept this for now.

Now, let's consider the rhombus MLPR. Let me try to find the coordinates of P and R such that ∠MRP = 70° and ∠RMP = 55°.

Let me use the Law of Sines in triangle MRP, where ∠RMP = 55°, ∠MRP = 70°, and ∠MPR = 55°, as before. This makes triangle MRP isosceles with MR = RP.

Let me denote MR = RP = a, and MP = b.

From the Law of Sines:

a / sin(70°) = b / sin(55°) → b = a * sin(55°) / sin(70°)

Let me calculate this value:

sin(55°) ≈ 0.8192

sin(70°) ≈ 0.9397

So b ≈ a * 0.8192 / 0.9397 ≈ a * 0.872

Now, in the rhombus MLPR, MR is a side, so a = w (since ML = w, and all sides are equal). Wait, no. In the rhombus, all sides are equal, so ML = LP = PR = RM = w. So MR is a side of the rhombus, so a = w. Therefore, MP = b ≈ 0.872w.

But MP is also a diagonal of the rhombus. In a rhombus, the diagonals are related to the sides and angles. Let me use the formula for the length of a diagonal in terms of the side and an angle.

If one of the angles of the rhombus is θ, then the lengths of the diagonals are d1 = 2w sin(θ/2) and d2 = 2w cos(θ/2). But which diagonal is which?

If the angle at M is 55°, then the diagonals would be:

d1 = 2w sin(55°/2) and d2 = 2w cos(55°/2)

But in this case, MP is one of the diagonals. Let's assume that MP is the diagonal corresponding to angle at M, which is 55°. So MP = 2w sin(55°/2). Let's calculate this:

sin(55°/2) = sin(27.5°) ≈ 0.4617

So MP ≈ 2w * 0.4617 ≈ 0.9234w

But earlier calculation from triangle MRP gave MP ≈ 0.872w. There is a discrepancy here. This suggests that the angle at M is not 55°, but something else.

Wait, this indicates that my assumption that ∠RMP is the angle at M of the rhombus is incorrect. Let me reconsider.

If ∠RMP is 55°, and it is not the angle at M of the rhombus, then what is it? Let me think about the structure of the rhombus MLPR.

Point M is connected to L and R. So at point M, the sides are ML and MR. The angle between these two sides is the angle of the rhombus at M. But ∠RMP is the angle at M between R, M, P. This is the same as the angle between MR and MP, not between ML and MR. Wait, this is crucial!

I think I made a critical error here. ∠RMP is at point M, between R, M, P. This is the angle between MR and MP, not between ML and MR. Earlier, I incorrectly associated ∠RMP with the angle at M of the rhombus, but it is actually the angle between MR and MP, which is a diagonal, not the side ML.

This changes everything! Let me correct this.

At point M, the sides of the rhombus are ML and MR. The angle between these two sides is the angle of the rhombus at M, let's call it φ. The angle ∠RMP is the angle at M between R, M, P, which is the angle between MR and MP. Since P is a vertex of the rhombus, MP is a diagonal.

So, in the rhombus, the diagonal MP divides the angle at M into two angles. If the angle at M is φ, then the diagonal MP divides it into two angles of φ/2 each. But ∠RMP is one of these angles, so ∠RMP = φ/2. Given that ∠RMP = 55°, this implies φ = 110°. Therefore, the angle at M of the rhombus is 110°, and the adjacent angle at L is 70°, since consecutive angles in a rhombus are supplementary.

Now, with this correction, let's proceed.

So, the angle at M of the rhombus is 110°, and the angle at L is 70°. This explains why ∠MRP = 70°, as it might relate to the angle at L.

Let me now use this information to find relations.

First, the angle at M of the rhombus is 110°, so the diagonal MP divides this angle into two angles of 55° each. Hence, ∠RMP = 55°, which matches the given information.

Now, let's find the length of diagonal MP in terms of the side length w. In a rhombus, the length of a diagonal can be calculated using the formula:

d = 2w sin(φ/2), where φ is one of the angles.

Here, φ = 110°, so the diagonal MP (which splits the angle at M) is:

MP = 2w sin(110°/2) = 2w sin(55°) ≈ 2w * 0.8192 ≈ 1.638w

Now, in triangle MRP, we have:

- ∠RMP = 55°

- ∠MRP = 70°

- ∠MPR = 180° - 55° - 70° = 55°

So, triangle MRP has angles 55°, 70°, 55°, making it isosceles with sides opposite equal angles equal. Thus, sides opposite 55° angles are equal. The angles at M and P are 55°, so sides opposite are RP and MR, respectively.

Wait, in triangle MRP:

- ∠ at M: 55°, opposite side RP

- ∠ at R: 70°, opposite side MP

- ∠ at P: 55°, opposite side MR

Therefore, RP = MR (since they are opposite equal angles).

But in the rhombus, all sides are equal, so MR is a side of the rhombus, which is w. Therefore, RP = w. But RP is also a side of the rhombus, since in the rhombus MLPR, the sides are ML, LP, PR, and RM. So PR is a side, hence length w. This is consistent.

Now, let's apply the Law of Sines to triangle MRP:

RP / sin(∠M) = MP / sin(∠R) = MR / sin(∠P)

Since RP = MR = w, and ∠M = ∠P = 55°, and ∠R = 70°, this gives:

w / sin(55°) = MP / sin(70°)

Solving for MP:

MP = w * sin(70°) / sin(55°) ≈ w * 0.9397 / 0.8192 ≈ w * 1.147

But earlier, from the rhombus, MP = 2w sin(55°) ≈ 1.638w. This creates a contradiction, as 1.147w ≠ 1.638w. What is the source of this discrepancy?

Ah! Here's the key: in the rhombus, MP is a diagonal, while in the triangle MRP, MP is a side of the triangle. Wait, no, MP is a diagonal of the rhombus and also a side of the triangle MRP. Therefore, both expressions for MP must be equal:

From rhombus: MP = 2w sin(55°)

From triangle: MP = w * sin(70°) / sin(55°)

Setting them equal:

2w sin(55°) = w * sin(70°) / sin(55°)

Cancel w:

2 sin(55°) = sin(70°) / sin(55°)

Multiply both sides by sin(55°):

2 sin²(55°) = sin(70°)

Let me calculate both sides:

Left: 2 * (sin(55°))² ≈ 2 * (0.8192)² ≈ 2 * 0.6710 ≈ 1.342

Right: sin(70°) ≈ 0.9397

Clearly, 1.342 ≠ 0.9397. This indicates a contradiction, suggesting another error in assumptions.

This suggests that my assumption about which diagonal MP is might be wrong. Perhaps MP is not the diagonal corresponding to the angle at M, but the other diagonal.

Let me reconsider. In a rhombus, there are two diagonals: one that splits the 110° angle at M and one that splits the 70° angle at L.

Let me denote the diagonals as d1 and d2. Let's say d1 is the diagonal splitting the 110° angle at M, and d2 is the diagonal splitting the 70° angle at L.

The lengths of the diagonals are:

d1 = 2w sin(φ/2), where φ is 110°, so d1 = 2w sin(55°) ≈ 1.638w

d2 = 2w sin(ψ/2), where ψ is 70°, so d2 = 2w sin(35°) ≈ 2w * 0.5736 ≈ 1.147w

Now, in triangle MRP, MP is one of these diagonals. If MP is d1 (the diagonal splitting the 110° angle), then MP = 1.638w, which should equal the value from the triangle, which was 1.147w. Not matching. If
