MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points N, M, P, Q, and some angles given. The question is asking for the measure of angle MPQ. Let me start by visualizing the diagram based on the given information.

First, the problem states that Point L lies on line QN. Wait, no, actually, it says PointLiesOnLine(P, Line(Q, N)). Wait, maybe there's a typo here? Or perhaps it's supposed to say that point P lies on line QN? Because the way it's written is confusing. Let me check again: "PointLiesOnLine(P, Line(Q, N))". Oh, right, so point P is on the line connecting Q and N. So, P is somewhere along the line segment QN, or extended?

Also, we know two angles: Angle at N between M and P is 56 degrees. So, angle NMP? Wait, the notation is Angle(N, M, P), which usually means the angle at point M between points N and P. Wait, no. Wait, in standard notation, Angle(A, B, C) refers to the angle at point B between points A and C. So, Angle(N, M, P) would be the angle at M between N and P. So, ∠NMP? Wait, no. If it's Angle(N, M, P), then vertex is M, with segments MN and MP. So, ∠NMP. And that measures 56 degrees.

Then, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(Q, N, M)), 45). So, Angle(Q, N, M) is the angle at N between Q and M. So, ∠QNM, which is 45 degrees.

So, putting this together: Points Q, N, M, and P. With P lying on line QN. Let me sketch this mentally. Let me imagine line QN. Then, point P is somewhere on that line. Now, we have triangle NMP? Wait, but if P is on line QN, then depending on where P is located, maybe triangle QNP or something else.

Wait, but also, we have angle at N (which is ∠QNM = 45°). So, point M is connected to N, and Q is another point such that when you connect Q to N, and then connect N to M, forming angle QNM of 45 degrees. Also, angle at M (∠NMP) is 56 degrees. Hmm.

Let me try to draw this. Let me consider line QN. Let me place point N somewhere. Then, point Q is on one side of N, and point P is on the same line QN. But where is point M? Since there's an angle at N between Q and M, meaning that M is not on line QN. So, from point N, there's a line NM making an angle of 45 degrees with QN. Also, from point M, there's a line MP such that angle at M between N and P is 56 degrees. Wait, since P is on line QN, then MP connects M to P on line QN.

So, we have triangle MNP? Or maybe triangle MQP? Not sure yet. Let me think about the triangles involved.

Since P is on line QN, then Q, N, P are colinear. So, let me denote that as line l. Let me assign coordinates to make it easier? Maybe coordinate geometry can help here.

Alternatively, use the law of sines or cosines. But first, let's see if we can find relationships between the angles.

We need to find angle MPQ, which is the angle at point P between points M and Q. Wait, angle MPQ is the angle at P between M and Q. Wait, no. Wait, angle MPQ is the angle at point P between points M and Q? No, angle MPQ would be the angle at point P between points M and Q? Wait, no. In standard notation, angle MPQ is the angle at point P between points M and Q. Wait, no. Wait, Angle(M, P, Q) would be the angle at P between M and Q. So, yes, ∠MPQ is the angle at P between M and Q. So, that's the angle we need to find.

But how do we find that? Let's see.

Given that:

- At point N, angle QNM is 45°, which is between QN and NM.

- At point M, angle NMP is 56°, which is between NM and PM.

And point P lies on line QN.

So, let me think about triangle MNP. In triangle MNP, we know angle at M is 56°, and we might be able to find other angles if we can determine more sides or angles.

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle QNP? Wait, but we don't know much about that.

Wait, since P is on line QN, then NP is part of that line. So, if I consider triangle QNM, but maybe not.

Alternatively, since P is on line QN, then Q-P-N or N-P-Q? Depending on where P is. But without loss of generality, let's assume that P is between Q and N, or beyond N? Hmm. The problem doesn't specify, so maybe we need to infer based on the angles.

But perhaps we can use the fact that the sum of angles around point N.

At point N, we have angle QNM = 45°, which is between QN and NM. Also, since P is on line QN, then line NP is just part of line QN. Therefore, if we look at triangle NMP, the angle at N is 45°, the angle at M is 56°, so maybe we can compute the third angle at P?

Wait, in triangle NMP, the sum of angles should be 180°. So, angle at N is 45°, angle at M is 56°, so angle at P would be 180 - 45 - 56 = 79°. So, angle at P in triangle NMP is 79°, which is ∠NPM. Wait, but angle NPM is the angle at P between N and M. However, we need angle MPQ, which is the angle at P between M and Q. Since Q is on line QN, and P is on line QN, then angle MPQ is adjacent to angle NPM?

Wait, let me clarify. If P is on line QN, then line QN passes through P. So, from point P, lines go to Q and N. Also, from point P, there's line PM. So, angle MPQ is formed at P between points M and Q. So, that would be the angle between PM and PQ. Since PQ is part of line QN (since P is on line QN), so angle between PM and PN (if P were between N and Q) or PN and PQ?

Wait, suppose P is between Q and N. Then, from point P, the line PN goes towards N, and PQ goes towards Q. So, angle MPQ would be between PM and PQ. But if P is between Q and N, then PQ is going from P to Q, and PM is going from P to M. So, the angle between PM and PQ is angle MPQ. 

But earlier, in triangle NMP, we found that angle at P is 79°, which is angle NPM. That angle is between PN and PM. Since PN is part of line QN, then angle between PN and PM is 79°, which is the same as angle between QN and PM. Therefore, angle MPQ is supplementary to angle NPM if P is between Q and N? Wait, because if you have line QN passing through P, then angle between PM and PN is 79°, but angle between PM and PQ would depend on the direction.

Wait, if P is between Q and N, then angle MPQ is the angle between PM and PQ, while angle NPM is between PM and PN. Since PN is in the opposite direction of PQ (because P is between Q and N), then angle MPQ would be equal to 180° minus angle NPM. Because they form a linear pair? Wait, if PN is extending from P to N, and PQ extends from P to Q (opposite direction), then angle between PM and PN is 79°, and angle between PM and PQ would be 180° - 79° = 101°. Is that possible?

Alternatively, maybe P is not between Q and N but extended beyond N. Then, angle NPM would be part of the angle MPQ? Not sure. Let me think carefully.

Suppose P is on line QN. There are two possibilities: either P is between Q and N, or P is outside the segment QN. Let's explore both cases.

Case 1: P is between Q and N. Then, line QN has points Q---P---N. Then, angle NPM is the angle at P between N and M. Which is between PN (towards N) and PM. While angle MPQ is the angle at P between M and Q. Since Q is on the other side of P relative to N, then angle between PM and PQ would be supplementary to angle NPM. Because PN and PQ are in opposite directions. So, angle MPQ = 180° - angle NPM. Since angle NPM was found as 79°, then angle MPQ would be 180 - 79 = 101°, which is option D.

Case 2: Suppose P is not between Q and N, but on the extension beyond N. Then, line QN would have points Q---N---P. Then, angle NPM is still the angle at P between N and M. Here, PN is from P to N, and PQ is from P to Q. So, angle between PM and PN is 79°, and angle between PM and PQ would be... Well, if you're looking at angle MPQ, which is at P between M and Q. So, PQ is from P to Q, which is in the direction away from N. So, the angle between PM and PQ would be the same as angle between PM and PN plus angle between PN and PQ? Wait, no. Because angle between PM and PQ depends on their positions.

Wait, if P is beyond N, then from point P, line PN goes back to N, and PQ goes from P to Q, which is in the direction opposite to PN. So, angle between PM and PN is 79°, and angle between PM and PQ would be 180° - 79° = 101°, same as before. Wait, but why? Because PN and PQ are in opposite directions. So regardless of whether P is between Q and N or beyond N, the angle between PM and PQ would be 180° - angle NPM. Hence, 180 - 79 = 101°, which is option D.

Therefore, the answer would be D. 101 degrees. However, let me verify if my assumption about triangle NMP being valid is correct.

In triangle NMP, we have angle at N is 45°, angle at M is 56°, hence angle at P is 180 - 45 - 56 = 79°, which is angle NPM. So that seems correct. Then, angle MPQ is supplementary to angle NPM, leading to 101°, which is option D.

Wait, but wait—what if the diagram isn't a triangle? For example, could there be some other configuration where those angles aren't in the same triangle?

Wait, let me re-examine the setup. We have angle QNM = 45°, which is at N between Q and M. So, that suggests that N is connected to Q and to M, forming that angle. Then, angle NMP is 56°, which is at M between N and P. So, that implies that M is connected to N and to P. So, P is connected to M and to N via the line QN. Therefore, P is connected to N (as part of line QN) and to M. So, triangle NMP exists. Therefore, the previous reasoning holds.

Thus, angle at P in triangle NMP is 79°, which is angle NPM. Then, angle MPQ is supplementary to that, giving 101°, so answer D.

Looking at the answer choices, D is 101. Therefore, the answer should be D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by interpreting the geometric constraints:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Given Angles**

From the problem, we are told:

- $ \angle NMP = 56^\circ $
- $ \angle QNM = 45^\circ $

These represent angles at points $ M $ and $ N $, respectively.

Also, it’s stated that **point $ P $ lies on the line $ QN $** — i.e., $ P $ is collinear with points $ Q $ and $ N $. This gives us key insight into the structure of the diagram.

---

### **Step 2: Consider Triangle $ \triangle NMP $**

Since $ P $ lies on line $ QN $, and we know:

- $ \angle NMP = 56^\circ $ (at point $ M $),
- $ \angle QNM = 45^\circ $ (at point $ N $),

we can deduce that triangle $ \triangle NMP $ is formed by connecting points $ N $, $ M $, and $ P $.

The sum of interior angles in a triangle is always $ 180^\circ $, so we calculate the remaining angle at point $ P $:

$$
\angle NPM = 180^\circ - \angle NMP - \angle QNM = 180^\circ - 56^\circ - 45^\circ = 79^\circ
$$

This tells us that $ \angle NPM = 79^\circ $.

---

### **Step 3: Determine $ \angle MPQ $**

Now, we want to find $ \angle MPQ $, which is the angle at point $ P $ between segments $ \overrightarrow{PM} $ and $ \overrightarrow{PQ} $.

Because point $ P $ lies on line $ QN $, the line $ QN $ acts as a straight line through $ P $, so the direction of $ \overrightarrow{PN} $ and $ \overrightarrow{PQ} $ are directly opposite each other.

Thus, the angle between $ \overrightarrow{PM} $ and $ \overrightarrow{PQ} $ is supplementary to $ \angle NPM $, because:

- $ \angle NPM $ is the angle between $ \overrightarrow{PN} $ and $ \overrightarrow{PM} $,
- $ \angle MPQ $ is the angle between $ \overrightarrow{PM} $ and $ \overrightarrow{PQ} $,
- These two angles form a straight line (i.e., $ \angle NPM + \angle MPQ = 180^\circ $).

So,

$$
\angle MPQ = 180^\circ - \angle NPM = 180^\circ - 79^\circ = 101^\circ
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

After analyzing the triangle and using the properties of angles in a triangle and supplementary angles, we conclude that:

$$
\boxed{\angle MPQ = 101^\circ}
$$

### **Final Answer: D**
