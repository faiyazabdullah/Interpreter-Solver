====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, so I need to solve this problem about a rhombus. Let me recall what I know about rhombuses. A rhombus is a type of quadrilateral where all four sides are of equal length. Also, opposite sides are parallel, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. But the key property here is that all sides are congruent. 

The question says that quadrilateral ABCD is a rhombus. They give two expressions for the lengths of sides AB and BC: AB = 2x + 3 and BC = x + 7. We need to find CD. 

Since it's a rhombus, all sides should be equal. That means AB equals BC equals CD equals DA. So, first, I can set the expressions for AB and BC equal to each other because they are sides of the rhombus. 

So, let me write that equation:

AB = BC  
=> 2x + 3 = x + 7

Now, solving for x. Subtract x from both sides:

2x + 3 - x = x + 7 - x  
Which simplifies to x + 3 = 7

Then subtract 3 from both sides:

x = 7 - 3  
x = 4

Alright, so x is 4. Now, we need to find CD. Since all sides of a rhombus are equal, CD should be equal to AB or BC. Let me check which expression to use. Wait, since CD is another side, it should also be equal to AB and BC. Therefore, once we have x, we can plug it into either expression to find the length of the side. 

But wait, maybe I should confirm whether CD is adjacent to BC? In a rhombus, consecutive sides are connected. So, AB is connected to BC, then BC to CD, etc. So, CD would be the next side after BC. Since all sides are equal, CD should be equal to BC, which is equal to AB. So, CD = BC = x + 7. Alternatively, since AB = 2x + 3, but since they are equal, once we find x, either expression gives the same value. 

Let me compute BC first. Plugging x=4 into BC: x + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11. Alternatively, plugging into AB: 2x + 3 = 2*4 + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11. Yep, same value. So each side is 11 units long. Therefore, CD is also 11. 

Looking at the answer choices: option B is 11. So the answer should be B. 

Wait, just making sure there isn't any trick here. Sometimes problems might refer to different parts, but in a rhombus, all sides are equal. So regardless of which side you take, they are all equal. Hence, CD is equal to BC, which is 11. 

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Let me check again my steps. 

First, equate AB and BC because they are sides of a rhombus. Solve for x, get x=4. Then substitute back into either expression to find the length. Both give 11. CD is another side, so same as others. All steps seem correct. 

I think that's solid. No mistakes detected here. Answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the properties of a **rhombus**. One of its defining characteristics is that **all four sides are congruent**, meaning every side has the same length. This fact is crucial for solving the problem.

---

### Step 1: Use the Given Side Lengths

We are told:

- $ AB = 2x + 3 $
- $ BC = x + 7 $

Because $ ABCD $ is a rhombus, all sides are equal. Thus,

$$
AB = BC
$$

Substitute the expressions:

$$
2x + 3 = x + 7
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve for $ x $

Subtract $ x $ from both sides:

$$
2x + 3 - x = x + 7 - x \Rightarrow x + 3 = 7
$$

Subtract 3 from both sides:

$$
x = 4
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the Side Length

Now that we know $ x = 4 $, we can substitute this back into either expression for side length (since all sides of a rhombus are equal):

Using $ BC = x + 7 $:

$$
BC = 4 + 7 = 11
$$

This confirms that **each side of the rhombus measures 11 units**.

Since $ CD $ is also a side of the rhombus, it must also measure:

$$
CD = 11
$$

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{B}
$$
