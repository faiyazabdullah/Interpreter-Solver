MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, and C. The angle at point B between points A, B, and C is 30 degrees. Wait, no—the measure of angle ABC is given as 30 degrees? Let me check again. The first constraint says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A, B, C)), 30). So that means angle at point B, formed by points A, B, C. So angle ABC is 30 degrees. 

Then, LengthOf(Line(A, C)) is 24. That would be the length of AC. Then, LengthOf(Line(B, C)) is x, so BC = x. And AB is y. Also, it says Perpendicular(Line(C, B), Line(C, A)). So lines CB and CA are perpendicular. Wait, line CB is from C to B, and line CA is from C to A. So those two lines meet at point C, and they are perpendicular. Therefore, triangle ABC has a right angle at point C. Because angle at C between points A, C, B is 90 degrees. 

Wait, hold on. If lines CB and CA are perpendicular, then angle at C is 90 degrees. But angle at B is given as 30 degrees. So triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at C, with angle at B being 30 degrees. Then, we need to find x, which is BC. 

Let me sketch this mentally. Right triangle with right angle at C. Angle at B is 30 degrees. Then, side opposite to angle B would be AC. Since angle at B is 30 degrees, then the sides can be related using trigonometric ratios. 

In a right-angled triangle, the tangent of an angle is opposite over adjacent. Let me recall. For angle B (which is 30 degrees), the opposite side is AC, and the adjacent side is BC. Wait, no. Let me think carefully. In triangle ABC, right-angled at C. So sides:

- Hypotenuse is AB.
- Side opposite angle B is AC.
- Side adjacent to angle B is BC.

So tan(angle B) = opposite / adjacent = AC / BC. 

Given that angle B is 30 degrees, so tan(30°) = AC / BC. We know AC is 24, so tan(30°) = 24 / BC. 

We can solve for BC (which is x). 

tan(30°) is 1/√3. So:

1/√3 = 24 / x → x = 24 * √3. 

Therefore, x equals 24√3, which corresponds to option C. 

But wait, let me double-check. Maybe I mixed up the sides. Let me confirm. In triangle ABC, right-angled at C. So angles are at A, B, C. Angle at C is 90°, angle at B is 30°, so angle at A must be 60°, since angles sum to 180. 

So, side opposite angle B (which is 30°) is AC. Side opposite angle A (60°) is BC. And hypotenuse AB. 

So yes, tan(30°) = opposite (AC) over adjacent (BC). Which gives us 24 / x = 1/√3. Solving for x gives x = 24√3. So that's option C. 

Alternatively, maybe using sine or cosine. Let's see. For angle B, sin(30°) = opposite / hypotenuse = AC / AB. But we don't know AB here. Alternatively, cos(30°) = adjacent / hypotenuse = BC / AB. But perhaps another way. However, since we have tan(30°) = AC / BC, which seems straightforward. 

Another approach: In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. Where the side opposite 30° is the shortest side. Here, angle B is 30°, so the side opposite is AC = 24. So that should be the shortest side. Then, the hypotenuse AB would be twice that, so 48. Then the remaining side BC (adjacent to 30°) would be 24√3. Which matches our earlier calculation. 

Yes, that makes sense. So BC is 24√3, so x = 24√3. Therefore, the correct answer is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the given problem, we begin by interpreting the geometric setup based on the constraints:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Setup**

- **Angle Constraint:** `MeasureOf(Angle(A, B, C)) = 30°`  
  This tells us that the angle at vertex **B** in triangle **ABC** is **30°**, i.e., ∠ABC = 30°.

- **Line Segment Constraints:**
  - `LengthOf(Line(A, C)) = 24` ⇒ $ AC = 24 $
  - `LengthOf(Line(B, C)) = x` ⇒ $ BC = x $
  - `LengthOf(Line(A, B)) = y` ⇒ $ AB = y $

- **Perpendicularity Constraint:**  
  `Perpendicular(Line(C, B), Line(C, A))` implies that ∠ACB is a **right angle** (i.e., 90°).

Thus, triangle **ABC** is a **right triangle** with:
- Right angle at **C**
- ∠ABC = 30°
- ∠BAC = 60° (since angles in triangle sum to 180°)

This confirms that triangle **ABC** is a **30-60-90 triangle**, with known side ratios.

---

### **Step 2: Use Trigonometric Ratios in the Triangle**

In a right triangle, the **tangent** of an angle is defined as:

$$
\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}
$$

Here, we focus on ∠ABC = 30°, where:
- Opposite side: $ AC = 24 $
- Adjacent side: $ BC = x $

So,

$$
\tan(30^\circ) = \frac{AC}{BC} = \frac{24}{x}
$$

Since $ \tan(30^\circ) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} $, we substitute:

$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{24}{x}
$$

Now solve for $ x $:

$$
x = 24 \cdot \sqrt{3}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Match with Given Options**

The value of $ x = 24\sqrt{3} $ directly matches **Option C**.

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{C}
$$
