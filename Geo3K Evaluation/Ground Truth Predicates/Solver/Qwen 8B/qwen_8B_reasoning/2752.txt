====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have a bunch of angle measures given as equalities, and some points lying on lines. The question is asking for the measure of angle 6, given that angle 1 is 50 degrees and angle 3 is 60 degrees. 

First, I need to parse all the constraints. There are a lot of point-on-line relationships, which probably indicate that certain lines are parallel or intersecting, forming various angles. Also, there are several pairs of angles that are equal, like Angle(M, J, B) equals angle 1, and so on. But since the diagram isn't provided, I'll have to infer the structure based on these constraints.

Let me start by listing out the key information:

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(M, J, B)), MeasureOf(angle 1)) → So angle at point J between M and B is equal to angle 1 (which is 50°).
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A, G, K)), MeasureOf(angle 3)) → Angle at point G between A and K is equal to angle 3 (which is 60°).
- Other angle equalities involve angles 2 through 8, but maybe they aren't directly needed yet.
  
Also, there's a mention of parallel lines:
- Parallel(Line(A, H), Line(G, K)) → So line AH is parallel to line GK.
- Parallel(Line(F, E), Line(J, M)) → FE || JM.
- Parallel(Line(W, D), Line(B, T)) → WD || BT.

Now, since angles are involved, I should think about transversals, corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, etc., especially considering the parallel lines.

But first, let me try to map out the points and their relations. Let me note down the points mentioned in the constraints:

Points involved in lines:
- Points A, B, F, G, J, H, T, U, N, Q, C, K, M, L, O, P, R, S, D, E, W, etc.

This seems complex. Maybe focusing on specific parts related to angles 1, 3, and 6 would help.

Angle 1 is equal to angle(M, J, B). That is, ∠MJB = angle 1 = 50°. Similarly, angle 3 is ∠AGK = 60°.

Then, angle 6 is ∠OPR? Wait, the notation for angle 6 is Angle(O, P, R), which is ∠OPR. Or wait, the way it's written is Angle(P, O, R)? Wait, the original says:

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(P, O, R)), MeasureOf(angle 4))
Wait, no, angle 6 is defined as Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(O, P, R)), MeasureOf(angle 6))? Wait, looking back:

Original list:

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(P, O, R)), MeasureOf(angle 5))
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(O, P, R)), MeasureOf(angle 6))

So angle 5 is ∠POR, and angle 6 is ∠OPR? Wait, angle notation can be confusing here. In standard notation, Angle(X, Y, Z) refers to the angle at vertex Y, formed by points X-Y-Z. So Angle(P, O, R) is the angle at point O between points P and R. So ∠POR. Similarly, Angle(O, P, R) is the angle at point P between O and R. So ∠OPR.

But angle 5 is ∠POR, and angle 6 is ∠OPR. Wait, but the user wrote:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(P, O, R)), MeasureOf(angle 5))"

Which would be ∠POR = angle 5.

And then:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(O, P, R)), MeasureOf(angle 6))", which is ∠OPR = angle 6.

Therefore, angle 6 is ∠OPR.

Our goal is to find the measure of angle 6, which is ∠OPR. Given that angle 1 is 50° and angle 3 is 60°.

To find ∠OPR, perhaps we need to relate it to other angles using the parallel lines and other given equalities.

First, let me see if there are any parallel lines that could form corresponding or alternate angles.

We know that Line(AH) is parallel to Line(GK). So AH || GK. Also, FE || JM and WD || BT.

Looking at the points involved in angle 1 (∠MJB) and angle 3 (∠AGK). Since AH || GK, and angle AGK is 60°, which might relate to other angles due to the parallel lines.

Let me consider Line AH || Line GK. If there is a transversal cutting these lines, then corresponding angles would be equal.

For example, suppose there is a line connecting points A and G, but I need to check if such a line exists. From the constraints, Point G lies on Line(A,B) and also on Line(A,F). Wait, let me go back to the constraints.

This is a lot! Let me try to visualize this. Let me focus on the part that relates to angle 1 and angle 3.

Angle 1 is ∠MJB = 50°, which is the angle at J between points M and B. Since J is on AB (from earlier constraints), and also on BG and BJ. Also, J is on BM because of the constraint that J is on Line(B, F), Line(B, G), Line(B, T). Wait, earlier constraints say:

PointLiesOnLine(J, Line(B, F)), PointLiesOnLine(J, Line(B, G)), PointLiesOnLine(J, Line(B, T)). So J is on lines BF, BG, BT. Therefore, J is a common point on those lines.

Similarly, M is mentioned in the angle definition for angle 1: ∠MJB. Also, M is part of Line(H, M) (since C is on Line(H, M), and S is on Line(H, M); and J is on Line(H, M). So Line HM connects H and M, passing through J?

Wait, PointLiesOnLine(J, Line(H, M)), yes. Because earlier: PointLiesOnLine(J, Line(H, M)) is stated. So J is on HM. Therefore, points H, J, M are colinear. Hence, Line HM passes through J.

Given that, and knowing that FE || JM (from the parallel lines constraint), so FE is parallel to JM. Since JM is part of HM, which includes point J. So FE || JM implies that FE is parallel to HM's segment JM.

Additionally, AH || GK. Now, AH is a line containing points A and H. GK is a line containing points G and K.

Now, angle 3 is ∠AGK = 60°, which is the angle at G between points A and K. Since G is on AB (from PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(A,B))), and also on AF and AJ (as per constraints). So G is on AB, AF, AJ, BG, etc. So G is likely a point along AB extended or something.

Since AH || GK, and if there's a transversal crossing them, maybe line AG or something else. Let me think. Suppose we have AH || GK. Then, if there's a line connecting A to G, that would create some angles. But since AH || GK, then the angles formed by a transversal would be equal.

Alternatively, maybe triangle AGK has some relation. Since angle at G is 60°, and AH || GK, perhaps there's a way to relate that.

But maybe I need to look for triangles or transversals that connect these elements.

Alternatively, let's think about angle 1: ∠MJB = 50°, which is at point J, between points M and B. Since J is on HM and on BT, as well as on BG, etc. Since FE || JM (from the parallel lines), and JM is part of HM, which is connected to J. So FE is parallel to JM. Therefore, FE || HM (since JM is part of HM).

If FE is parallel to HM, then maybe there are some corresponding angles or alternate interior angles when another transversal crosses them.

But I'm getting stuck trying to visualize. Let me try to approach this step by step.

First, let's note that angle 1 is ∠MJB = 50°, which is at point J. Since J is on HM (because of the Line(H,M)), and M is on HM. Also, since FE || JM, then FE is parallel to JM. So if I can find a transversal that intersects both FE and JM, then the angles formed would be equal.

Suppose line JB is a transversal intersecting FE and JM. Wait, J is on JM (since JM is part of HM, and J is on HM). So line JM is just the line HM itself. So if FE is parallel to JM (i.e., HM), then line JB would be a transversal crossing FE and HM. Therefore, the angle between FE and JB would correspond to the angle between HM and JB, which is ∠MJB = 50°. Therefore, the corresponding angle on FE would be equal to 50°.

But without knowing which specific angle that corresponds to, it's hard to proceed. However, maybe this helps us find some relationship with other angles.

Similarly, angle 3 is ∠AGK = 60°, which is at point G. Since AH || GK, and G is on AB, which is connected to A. So if there's a transversal across AH and GK, then angles formed would be equal. For instance, if there's a line connecting A to G, then since AH || GK, the angle at A (between AH and AG) would be equal to the angle at G (between GK and AG). But ∠AGK is given as 60°, so maybe that's the case.

Wait, if AH || GK, and line AG is a transversal, then the corresponding angles would be equal. The angle between AH and AG at A would be equal to the angle between GK and AG at G. Therefore, ∠HAG = ∠AGK. Since ∠AGK is 60°, then ∠HAG is also 60°. 

So, ∠HAG = 60°, which is the angle at A between HA and GA. 

Now, since AH || GK, and if there's a line connecting H to G, but I don't know if that's necessary. Alternatively, maybe triangle AGK has some properties.

But how does this relate to angle 6, which is ∠OPR?

Hmm. Let me think about angle 6 again: ∠OPR. This is the angle at point P between O and R. To find this, we need to determine the relationship between points O, P, R. 

Looking at the constraints, O, P, R are points on Line(F, L), Line(F, N), Line(F, P), etc. Let me check the constraints involving O, P, R.

From earlier constraints:

- PointLiesOnLine(O, Line(F, L)): O is on FL.
- PointLiesOnLine(P, Line(F, L)): P is on FL.
- PointLiesOnLine(O, Line(F, N)): O is on FN.
- PointLiesOnLine(P, Line(F, N)): P is on FN.
- PointLiesOnLine(O, Line(F, P)): O is on FP.
- PointLiesOnLine(P, Line(F, P)): Well, P is on FP, which makes sense since P is on FL and FN and FP. So points F, O, P are colinear? Wait, O is on FP, meaning O is between F and P or vice versa. Similarly, P is on FL and FN. So P is the intersection point of lines FL and FN? Wait, but FL and FN share point F, so their intersection is at F. Unless P is another point. Wait, P is on FL and FN. So if FL and FN meet at F, then P is somewhere along FL and FN. Wait, unless FL and FN are the same line. But if FL and FN are different lines, then P is the intersection of FL and FN, which is F. But P cannot be F because it's on FL, FN, and also on other lines. This suggests that FL and FN are the same line, so P is a point on that line. So F, O, P are colinear along FL.

But there's more. Also, O is on FN and FP. So O is on line FP, which is part of FL. So points F, O, P are colinear. Similarly, P is on FL and FN. So FL and FN are two lines passing through F, and P is on both. Wait, unless P is at F? No, since P is on FL and FN, but also on other lines. Let me re-examine:

PointLiesOnLine(P, Line(F, L)) → P is on FL.
PointLiesOnLine(P, Line(F, N)) → P is on FN.
Thus, P is the intersection of FL and FN. But since FL and FN both pass through F, their intersection is F. Therefore, P must be F? But that can't be, since P is also on other lines. Wait, unless there's a mistake here. Wait, perhaps the line FL and FN are not the same line. Wait, but if both FL and FN pass through F, then their intersection is F. So P being on both FL and FN means P=F? But then P would coincide with F, which is possible only if P is F. However, other constraints may require P to be distinct from F. For example, P is on Line(F, L), Line(F, N), Line(F, P), etc. So if P is on Line(F, P), that's trivially true. So this suggests that P is the point F? But that seems unlikely, as otherwise, other constraints may conflict. Maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, the constraints state:

PointLiesOnLine(O, Line(F, L)): O is on FL.
PointLiesOnLine(P, Line(F, L)): P is on FL.
PointLiesOnLine(O, Line(F, N)): O is on FN.
PointLiesOnLine(P, Line(F, N)): P is on FN.
So P is on both FL and FN, hence P is the intersection of FL and FN. Which is F, unless FL and FN are the same line. If FL and FN are the same line, then P is any point on that line. Otherwise, P is F. But since P is also on Line(F, P), which is redundant. Hmm. This is confusing. Maybe there's a typo or misunderstanding in the constraints. Alternatively, maybe P is a different point. Perhaps FL and FN are different lines passing through F, and P is a point on both lines. But that would mean that P=F. So perhaps there's an error in my interpretation. Alternatively, maybe "Line(F, L)" and "Line(F, N)" refer to different lines, and P is a point on both, implying that P=F. But then, how does that fit with other constraints?

Alternatively, maybe I misread the constraints. Let me double-check:

The constraints include:

PointLiesOnLine(P, Line(F, L)): Yes.
PointLiesOnLine(P, Line(F, N)): Yes.
PointLiesOnLine(P, Line(F, P)): Wait, no, that's not in the list. The constraints mention:

PointLiesOnLine(O, Line(F, P)): O is on FP.
So O is on FP. So O is on the line connecting F and P. Similarly, P is on FL and FN. So P is on FL, which contains F and L. And P is on FN, which contains F and N. Therefore, P is the intersection of FL and FN, which is F, unless FL and FN are the same line. But if they are different, then P=F. So assuming P=F, but that may not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps FL and FN are the same line, so P is on that line. But without more info, it's tricky.

Maybe I need to move away from this and think about other parts. Let me think about the parallel lines again. We have FE || JM, and AH || GK. Also, WD || BT. Maybe some of these lines are involved in creating similar triangles or angle relationships.

Since angle 1 is 50°, which is ∠MJB, and FE || JM, then maybe there's a way to use that to find another angle. For example, if there's a transversal that creates corresponding angles. If I imagine line JB intersecting FE and JM (which is parallel to FE), then the angle between JB and FE would be equal to ∠MJB = 50°. Therefore, the corresponding angle on FE would be 50°, which might be another angle in the figure.

Similarly, angle 3 is 60°, which is ∠AGK. Since AH || GK, and if there's a transversal AG, then the angle at A (between AH and AG) is equal to ∠AGK = 60°, as discussed before.

Now, how do these angles relate to angle 6? Let's think about angle 6, which is ∠OPR. To find this angle, we might need to find some relationship between O, P, R.

Looking at the constraints involving O, P, R:

- O is on Line(F, L), Line(F, N), Line(F, P), Line(Q, O), Line(Q, S), Line(R, S), Line(R, W), Line(S, D), etc.
- P is on Line(F, L), Line(F, N), Line(F, P), Line(N, E), Line(N, O), Line(N, L), Line(E, L), Line(R, C), Line(R, I), Line(C, K), Line(I, K), Line(K, P), etc.
- R is on Line(G, C), Line(G, I), Line(G, P), Line(Q, O), Line(Q, S), Line(Q, W), Line(D, O), Line(D, W), Line(S, D), Line(R, D), Line(R, I), Line(R, K), Line(R, S), Line(R, W), Line(S, D), Line(S, W), etc.

This is very interconnected. It seems that multiple lines intersect at various points. Perhaps there's a triangle or quadrilateral involving O, P, R.

Alternatively, since O and P are on FL and FN, and R is connected via other lines, maybe there's a parallelogram or something. But without seeing the diagram, it's challenging.

Another thought: since we have parallel lines, maybe the sum of angles around certain points can give us the measure of angle 6.

Alternatively, since angle 1 is 50°, and angle 3 is 60°, which are given, maybe we can find other angles using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, or supplementary angles.

Wait, let's think about triangle AGK. We know ∠AGK = 60°, and if we can find other angles in that triangle, we might get more info. But I don't know if that helps directly.

Alternatively, since AH || GK, and if there's a transversal AG, then ∠HAG = ∠AGK = 60°, as previously thought. So ∠HAG = 60°, which is the angle at A between HA and GA. If we can find other angles involving HA or GA, that might help.

Now, going back to angle 1, which is ∠MJB = 50°. Since FE || JM, and if there's a line that forms a transversal with FE and JM, then we can use the corresponding angles. For example, if line JB is the transversal, then the angle between FE and JB would be equal to ∠MJB = 50°. So that angle would be 50°, which might be another angle in the diagram, possibly relating to other parts.

But how does this tie into angle 6? Maybe through some triangle or transversal that connects these angles.

Alternatively, since we're dealing with parallel lines and angles, maybe angle 6 is supplementary or complementary to other known angles.

Wait, let's think about the parallel lines WD || BT. If there's a transversal crossing them, we can find corresponding angles. But without knowing which transversal, it's unclear.

Alternatively, since angle 1 is 50° and angle 3 is 60°, which are given, and the problem asks for angle 6, which is ∠OPR. Perhaps there's a series of angle relationships leading from angle 1 and 3 to angle 6.

Alternatively, maybe angle 6 is part of a triangle where we can apply the triangle angle sum theorem.

Wait, let's assume that angle 6 is part of a triangle where we can find its value based on other angles. But to do that, I need to identify which triangle it belongs to.

Alternatively, maybe angle 6 is vertically opposite, corresponding, or alternate to another angle that we can calculate from the given values.

Wait, let's try to think about the parallel lines again. Since FE || JM, and if there's a transversal that cuts both FE and JM, then the corresponding angles would be equal. Earlier, we considered line JB as the transversal, giving us ∠MJB = 50°, which would correspond to an angle on FE. Let's call that angle x = 50°. If I can find x's relationship to other angles, that might help.

Also, from the parallel lines AH || GK, we had ∠HAG = 60°, which could be part of a larger figure.

Perhaps combining these two pieces of information: 50° and 60°, and using some geometric relationships to find angle 6.

But I need to think of a specific path. Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Use the parallel lines to find corresponding angles.
2. Use the given angles (1 and 3) to find other angles.
3. Use triangle properties or other geometric theorems to find angle 6.

Let me attempt step 1: Using FE || JM.

As before, line FE is parallel to line JM. Let's take a transversal that intersects both FE and JM. For example, line JB, which goes through J (on JM) and B. Since FE || JM, the angle between FE and JB at the point where they intersect would be equal to ∠MJB = 50°. This would create an angle of 50° on FE. Let's denote this angle as ∠FEB = 50°, assuming that B is on FE. Wait, but B is on Line(A, B), and FE is parallel to JM. Not sure if B is on FE. Let me check the constraints.

PointLiesOnLine(F, Line(A, B)): F is on AB.
PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(A, B)): G is on AB.
PointLiesOnLine(J, Line(A, B)): J is on AB.
So points F, G, J are on line AB. Also, FE is parallel to JM. So FE is a separate line from AB, but parallel to JM.

So if FE is parallel to JM, and line JB is a transversal, then the angle between FE and JB is equal to the angle between JM and JB, which is ∠MJB = 50°. So that gives us an angle of 50° on line FE.

Now, if I can find a relationship between this angle and other parts of the diagram, it might help.

Next, since AH || GK, and ∠AGK = 60°, then ∠HAG = 60°, as discussed. So if I can find a triangle involving HAG, or relate it to other parts.

Now, perhaps angle 6 is related to these angles through some triangle or via the parallel lines.

Alternatively, since angle 6 is ∠OPR, and O, P, R are on various lines, perhaps we can find that ∠OPR is supplementary or equal to one of the known angles.

Alternatively, think about the lines involving O, P, R. For example, O is on FP and FN, P is on FL and FN, and R is on GC and other lines. Maybe there's a triangle or parallelogram involving these points.

Alternatively, since there are multiple parallel lines, maybe the angles around point P or O add up in some way.

Wait, let's consider the line FP. Since O is on FP (PointLiesOnLine(O, Line(F, P))), and P is on FL and FN. So line FP is part of FL and FN. Also, from earlier, P is on Line(F, L), Line(F, N), Line(F, P), etc. So line FP is the same as FL and FN? Not necessarily, unless FL and FN are the same line.

Assuming FL and FN are different lines, then P is the intersection of FL and FN, which is F. But then P would be F, making ∠OPR undefined since P=F. So this suggests that FL and FN are the same line, meaning that P is a point on that line. Thus, P is on line FL, which contains F and L, and also on line FN, which contains F and N. So if FL and FN are the same line, then N is on line FL. Hence, N is on FL, which is the same as FN. So N is on line FL.

With that, line FL contains points F, L, N, P, O, etc. So P is on FL, which is the same line as FN. So P is a point on FL. Then, O is on FP (part of FL), so O is between F and P or vice versa. Similarly, R is on GC, etc.

Now, angle 6 is ∠OPR. So at point P, between points O and R. To find this angle, we need to know the configuration of O, P, R. Since P is on FL, and R is on GC, which is another line. So maybe there's a line PR that connects P to R, and we need to find the angle at P between O and R.

But without knowing the exact positions, it's still difficult. Let me think if there's any other constraints involving R.
