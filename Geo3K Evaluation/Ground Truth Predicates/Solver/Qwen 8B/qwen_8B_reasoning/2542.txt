MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have some points and lines with certain constraints. Let me start by breaking down the given information.

First, the problem states that the length of line QC is 5 units, and the length of line Q'C is 15 units. Also, point Q lies on the line Q'C. Additionally, point F lies on the line BC. Wait, but I need to find the scale factor from Q to Q'. Hmm, scale factor usually relates to similarity transformations, right? Like when you have two similar figures, the ratio of their corresponding sides is the scale factor. But how does this apply here?

Let me visualize this. There's a line segment QC which is 5 units long, and another segment Q'C which is 15 units. Since Q lies on the line Q'C, maybe these two segments are colinear? So, points Q, C, and Q' are all on the same straight line. Wait, but QC is 5, and Q'C is 15. If Q is on line Q'C, then perhaps Q is between Q' and C, or maybe C is between Q and Q'? Let me think.

If Q is on line Q'C, then depending on the positions, the distances could vary. Suppose Q'----C----Q, so that QC would be the distance from Q to C, and Q'C would be from Q' to C. Then QC = 5, Q'C = 15. So if Q is beyond C from Q', then the total length from Q' to Q would be Q'C + QC = 15 + 5 = 20. Alternatively, if C is between Q and Q', then QC would be part of Q'Q. For example, Q-----C-----Q', then Q'C would be QC + CQ'? Wait, no. If C is between Q and Q', then Q'C would be the distance from Q' to C, which would be less than Q'Q. But in our case, Q'C is 15, and QC is 5. So maybe Q is between Q' and C? Let me check.

Wait, if Q is between Q' and C, then the length from Q' to C would be Q'Q + QC. So Q'C = Q'Q + QC. Given that Q'C is 15, and QC is 5, then Q'Q would be Q'C - QC = 15 - 5 = 10. Therefore, the distance from Q' to Q is 10. But the question asks for the scale factor from Q to Q'. Wait, scale factor can be tricky here. Scale factor is typically the ratio of lengths between corresponding parts of similar figures. But in this case, since they're points on a line, maybe it's about dilation?

Alternatively, considering that there might be a dilation transformation taking Q to Q' with center at C. Because if we consider point C as the center of dilation, then scaling Q to Q' would involve multiplying the distance from C by a scale factor. Let me explore that.

Suppose there is a dilation (scaling) centered at point C. The original point is Q, and after scaling, it becomes Q'. The scale factor k would satisfy the relationship:

Distance from C to Q' = k * Distance from C to Q.

But wait, according to the problem, LengthOf(QC) is 5, and LengthOf(Q'C) is 15. So if the scale factor is k, then:

QC' = k * QC ?

Wait, if Q is scaled from Q', then maybe it's the reverse. Let me clarify.

If the scale factor is from Q to Q', meaning that Q' is the image of Q under a dilation. Then, the formula would be:

distance from center to Q' = scale factor * distance from center to Q.

Assuming the center is C, then:

Length of CQ' = k * Length of CQ.

Given that Length(CQ) is 5, Length(CQ') is 15. Then:

15 = k * 5 => k = 15 / 5 = 3. So the scale factor would be 3. That seems straightforward. But wait, the problem says "scale factor from Q to Q'", so that would mean Q' is the image of Q under the dilation. Hence, the scale factor is 3. Which would make answer B.

But let me double-check. Another way: If Q is on the line Q'C, then the points are arranged such that Q, C, Q' are colinear. Depending on the position, if C is between Q and Q', then QC + CQ' = QQ'. But in that case, QC is 5, CQ' is 15, so QQ' would be 20. Then, the scale factor would be the ratio of distances from the center. Wait, but if the center is C, then the scale factor is the ratio of distances from C. But if Q is being scaled to Q', then the scale factor would be Q'C / QC = 15/5 = 3. So yes, that gives 3. 

Alternatively, if Q was between Q' and C, then Q'C would be Q'Q + QC. So Q'Q = Q'C - QC = 15 - 5 = 10. Then the scale factor would be Q'Q / QC = 10/5 = 2. But that would depend on the position of Q relative to C and Q'. However, the problem states that PointLiesOnLine(Q, Line(Q', C)). So Q lies on the line through Q' and C. This means that Q is somewhere along the line extending from Q' through C, or vice versa. But without knowing the exact position, we need to infer based on the distances.

Wait, but if Q lies on line Q'C, then there are two possibilities:

Case 1: C is between Q and Q'. Then QC + CQ' = QQ'. But QC = 5, CQ' = 15, so QQ' = 20. Then, if we consider a dilation centered at C, taking Q to Q', then the scale factor would be Q'C / QC = 15 / 5 = 3. So that's consistent with answer B.

Case 2: Q is between Q' and C. Then Q'Q + QC = Q'C. Wait, no. If Q is between Q' and C, then the distance from Q' to C would be Q'Q + QC. So Q'C = Q'Q + QC. We know Q'C is 15, QC is 5. So Q'Q = 15 - 5 = 10. Then, if the scale factor is from Q to Q', again assuming center at C, then the scale factor would be Q'C / QC = 15 / 5 = 3. Wait, but in this case, Q is between Q' and C, so the direction matters. However, regardless of whether Q is between Q' and C or not, the ratio of distances from C would still be 15/5=3. Therefore, the scale factor would be 3.

Therefore, the answer should be B, 3.

Wait, but why do I think that the scale factor is Q'C / QC? Let me confirm. If we have a dilation with center at C, then each point P is mapped to P' such that CP' = k * CP. So if Q maps to Q', then CQ' = k * CQ. Therefore, k = CQ'/CQ = 15/5 = 3. Therefore, the scale factor is 3. So answer B.

Another angle: The problem mentions PointF lies on line BC, but that might be irrelevant to finding the scale factor between Q and Q'. Maybe that's just extra info, or maybe it's part of a larger diagram that isn't fully described here. Since the question only asks about the scale factor from Q to Q', and the other condition about F is not mentioned in relation to Q or Q', perhaps it's a red herring or part of another part of the problem not needed here. So focusing back on Q and Q'.

So, the key is that Q lies on line Q'C, meaning that Q, C, Q' are colinear. And the distances from C are QC = 5, Q'C = 15. Assuming the dilation is around C, then the scale factor is 3. Thus, answer B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the **scale factor from Q to Q'**, we focus on the geometric relationships provided:

---

### Step 1: Understand the Geometric Configuration

We are told:

- $ \text{Length}(QC) = 5 $
- $ \text{Length}(Q'C) = 15 $
- $ Q $ lies on the line $ \overline{Q'C} $

This implies that points $ Q $, $ C $, and $ Q' $ are collinear, and $ Q $ lies somewhere along the line passing through $ Q' $ and $ C $. The key insight is that both $ Q $ and $ Q' $ lie on the same line, with $ C $ acting as a reference point.

---

### Step 2: Interpret the Scale Factor

The **scale factor** from $ Q $ to $ Q' $ refers to the ratio of the distances from a common center of dilation â€” in this case, point $ C $. The general rule for dilation is:

$$
\text{Scale Factor } k = \frac{\text{Distance from Center to Image}}{\text{Distance from Center to Pre-image}}
$$

In this context, the pre-image is point $ Q $, and its image is point $ Q' $, both lying on the same line through the center $ C $. Therefore:

$$
k = \frac{\text{Length}(CQ')}{\text{Length}(CQ)} = \frac{15}{5} = 3
$$

---

### Step 3: Final Conclusion

Thus, the **scale factor from $ Q $ to $ Q' $** is:

$$
\boxed{3}
$$

### Final Answer:  
**Final Answer: B**
