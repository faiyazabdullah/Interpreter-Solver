MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have some angles given with certain measures and relationships between them. The goal is to find the value of x. Let's break down the information step by step.

First, the problem mentions several angles with specific measures. Let me list out what's given:

1. Measure of angle N-L-M is 65 degrees. So that's angle at point L between points N and M. Wait, angle notation can sometimes be confusing. In standard notation, Angle(N, L, M) would mean the angle at point L formed by points N, L, M. So it's ∠NLM, right? Similarly, Angle(L, M, N) would be ∠LMN. 

So, first two equations are about angles in triangle LMN? Because those three points form a triangle. Let me check: If we have points N, L, M forming a triangle, then the sum of their internal angles should be 180 degrees. But wait, the measure of angle N-L-M (which is ∠NLM) is 65°, and angle L-M-N (∠LMN) is 51°. Then, the third angle at point N would be... Let me calculate that.

Sum of angles in triangle is 180°, so third angle would be 180 - 65 - 51 = 64 degrees. Wait, 65 + 51 is 116, so 180 - 116 is 64. So angle at N, which would be ∠MNL? Or maybe I need to confirm the notation again. Wait, angle L-M-N is ∠LMN, which is at point M. Wait, no. Let me get back. 

Wait, Angle(N, L, M) is ∠NLM, vertex at L, sides LN and LM. Then Angle(L, M, N) is ∠LMN, vertex at M, sides ML and MN. So the triangle is LMN with vertices L, M, N. Therefore, the three angles are at each vertex. So the third angle would be at point N, which is ∠MNL. So that angle would be 64 degrees. 

But perhaps that's not directly needed yet. Now, moving on. The next part says Measure of angle Y-X-Z is 4x. So that's ∠YXZ, which is an angle at point X between points Y and Z. Then, Measure of angle Y-Z-X equals Measure of angle M-L-N. Wait, angle Y-Z-X is ∠YZX, which is at point Z between Y and X. And that's equal to angle M-L-N. Wait, angle M-L-N is ∠MLN, which was given as 65 degrees earlier. Wait, no. Wait, angle M-L-N is ∠MLN? Wait, original first equation was MeasureOf(Angle(N, L, M)) = 65, which is ∠NLM. Then MeasureOf(Angle(L, M, N)) is ∠LMN = 51. Then, the third angle at N, which is ∠MNL, which we calculated as 64 degrees. 

Now, the next condition is MeasureOf(Angle(Y, Z, X)) equals MeasureOf(Angle(M, L, N)). Let's parse that. Angle(Y,Z,X) is ∠YZX, which is at point Z between Y and X. And Angle(M,L,N) is ∠MLN, which is the same as ∠NLM, which was given as 65 degrees. Wait, no. Wait, Angle(M,L,N) is ∠MLN, which is the same as ∠NLM? No, because ∠MLN has vertex at L, while ∠NLM also has vertex at L. Wait, actually, ∠MLN and ∠NLM are the same angle. Because the middle letter is the vertex. So ∠MLN is the same as ∠NLM. So that angle is 65 degrees. Therefore, ∠YZX = 65 degrees. 

Then, the last condition is MeasureOf(Angle(Z,Y,X)) equals MeasureOf(Angle(N,M,L)). Let's see. Angle(Z,Y,X) is ∠ZYX, which is at point Y between Z and X. And Angle(N,M,L) is ∠NML, which is the same as ∠LMN, which was given as 51 degrees. So ∠ZYX equals 51 degrees. 

So putting this together, we have triangle YZX with angles at X being 4x, at Z being 65 degrees, and at Y being 51 degrees. Wait, but hold on. Wait, the angles in triangle YZX must add up to 180 degrees. Let me confirm:

In triangle YZX, the angles are:

- At X: ∠YXZ = 4x
- At Z: ∠YZX = 65°
- At Y: ∠ZYX = 51°

Therefore, adding these up: 4x + 65 + 51 = 180. So solving for x:

4x + 116 = 180  
Subtract 116: 4x = 64  
Divide by 4: x = 16. 

So x is 16. Looking at the answer choices, option B is 16. So that would be the answer. 

Wait, but let me make sure there isn't any misunderstanding here. Let me recheck each step. 

First, confirming that ∠YZX is 65°, which comes from MeasureOf(Angle(Y,Z,X)) equals MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,N)). Since Angle(M,L,N) is ∠MLN, which is 65°, yes. Then ∠ZYX is equal to MeasureOf(Angle(N,M,L)), which is ∠NML, which is ∠LMN, which was given as 51°, so that's correct. 

So triangle YZX has angles 4x, 65°, and 51°, so total 4x + 65 + 51 = 180. Which gives 4x=64 => x=16. That seems straightforward. 

So the answer should be B. 16. Let me check if there's another way this could be interpreted. For example, maybe the triangles aren't necessarily triangles? But the notation suggests that they are angles within triangles. Also, since angles are mentioned with three points, it's safe to assume that they are angles of triangles. 

Alternatively, could there be something else? Like maybe the diagram is different? But without seeing the diagram, we have to rely strictly on the given relations. 

Another possible mistake could be miscalculating the sum of angles. Let me verify again:

If the angles in triangle YZX are ∠YXZ = 4x, ∠YZX = 65°, ∠ZYX = 51°, then:

Sum = 4x + 65 + 51 = 4x + 116 = 180  
Thus, 4x = 64 → x=16. Correct. 

Yes, that seems solid. So unless there's an error in interpreting the angle notations, which I don't think so, the answer is B. 16. So Final Answer: B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we begin by analyzing the given geometric constraints involving angles:

---

### Step 1: Understand Given Angles

We are told:

1. $ \angle N-L-M = 65^\circ $
   - This corresponds to $ \angle NLM $, i.e., the angle at vertex **L** between segments $ NL $ and $ LM $

2. $ \angle L-M-N = 51^\circ $
   - This corresponds to $ \angle LMN $, i.e., the angle at vertex **M** between segments $ ML $ and $ MN $

From these, we can deduce that triangle $ \triangle LMN $ contains the following angles:

- $ \angle NLM = 65^\circ $
- $ \angle LMN = 51^\circ $
- Using the Triangle Sum Theorem:  
  $$
  \angle MNL = 180^\circ - 65^\circ - 51^\circ = 64^\circ
  $$

---

### Step 2: Use Given Relationships Between Other Angles

Next, we're told:

3. $ \angle Y-X-Z = 4x $
   - This is $ \angle YXZ $, the angle at vertex **X** between segments $ XY $ and $ XZ $

4. $ \angle Y-Z-X = \angle M-L-N $
   - This means $ \angle YZX = \angle NLM = 65^\circ $

5. $ \angle Z-Y-X = \angle N-M-L $
   - This means $ \angle ZYX = \angle NML = 51^\circ $

So, triangle $ \triangle YZX $ has the following angles:

- $ \angle YXZ = 4x $
- $ \angle YZX = 65^\circ $
- $ \angle ZYX = 51^\circ $

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ x $

Using the Triangle Sum Theorem for triangle $ \triangle YZX $:

$$
\angle YXZ + \angle YZX + \angle ZYX = 180^\circ
$$

Substitute known values:

$$
4x + 65^\circ + 51^\circ = 180^\circ
$$

$$
4x + 116^\circ = 180^\circ
$$

$$
4x = 64^\circ
$$

$$
x = 16
$$

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{B}
$$
