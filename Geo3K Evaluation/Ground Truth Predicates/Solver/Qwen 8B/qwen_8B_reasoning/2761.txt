MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. Hmm, there are several constraints here, so I need to break them down step by step. Let me start by listing out all the given information and see how they connect.

First, the problem mentions points A, B, C, X, F, G, H, E. There are several equal lengths and angle measures, as well as some point-on-line conditions. The goal is to find the value of x. The answer choices are A. 3, B. 4, C. 5, D. 6. So I need to figure out which one it is.

Let me parse each constraint one by one.

Starting with the first part:

1. Equals(LengthOf(Line(B, C)), 3x). So BC = 3x.
2. Equals(LengthOf(Line(B, X)), 8). So BX = 8.
3. PointLiesOnLine(X, Line(A, C)). So point X lies on line AC.
4. Equals(LengthOf(Line(A, X)), LengthOf(Line(C, X))). So AX = CX. That means X is the midpoint of AC because it divides AC into two equal parts.
   
So from 3 and 4, since X is on AC and AX = CX, then X is the midpoint of AC. Therefore, AC = 2 * AX (or 2 * CX). But we also know that BC = 3x. Wait, but how does BC relate to AC? Maybe triangle ABC?

Wait, maybe there's a triangle involving points A, B, C, and X. Since X is on AC, and we have BX = 8. Also, BC = 3x. Maybe using the Law of Cosines or something else here. But we also have angles mentioned later.

Then moving on to the second set of constraints:

5. Equals(LengthOf(Line(F, H)), x). So FH = x.
6. Equals(LengthOf(Line(F, G)), 6). FG = 6.
7. PointLiesOnLine(H, Line(G, E)). So H is on GE.
8. Equals(LengthOf(Line(G, H)), LengthOf(Line(H, E))). So GH = HE. Hence, H is the midpoint of GE. Therefore, GE = 2*GH or 2*HE.
   
Similarly, angles:

9. Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B, C, X)), MeasureOf(Angle(F, G, H))). So angle at C between B-C-X equals angle at G between F-G-H.
10. Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B, A, X)), MeasureOf(Angle(F, E, H))). Angle at A between B-A-X equals angle at E between F-E-H.

Hmm. So there's a similarity or congruence between triangles? Because angles are equal, perhaps similar triangles?

Let me think about the first part with points A, B, C, X. Since X is the midpoint of AC, maybe triangle BAC has some relation. Let me consider triangle BXC. Wait, but X is on AC. Alternatively, maybe triangle BAX or BCX?

But we have BX = 8, and BC = 3x. Also, AX = CX. Let me denote AC as 2m, so that AX = CX = m. Then, perhaps applying Stewart’s theorem? Or maybe coordinate geometry?

Alternatively, considering coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to make things easier.

Let me place point A at (0, 0) and point C at (2m, 0), so that X, being the midpoint, is at (m, 0). Then point B is somewhere such that BC = 3x. Let me assume coordinates for B. Let me suppose coordinates for B as (p, q). Then, coordinates of X are (m, 0).

The length BX is 8. So distance between B(p,q) and X(m,0) is sqrt[(p - m)^2 + (q - 0)^2] = 8. So (p - m)^2 + q^2 = 64.

Also, BC is the distance between B(p,q) and C(2m, 0): sqrt[(2m - p)^2 + (0 - q)^2] = 3x. Squared, that gives (2m - p)^2 + q^2 = 9x².

Now, maybe we can subtract equations? Let me subtract the equation for BX squared from BC squared:

(2m - p)^2 + q^2 - [(p - m)^2 + q^2] = 9x² - 64.

Expanding both terms:

(4m² - 4mp + p²) + q² - [p² - 2mp + m² + q²] = 9x² - 64.

Simplify term by term:

First part: 4m² - 4mp + p² + q²

Second part inside the brackets: p² - 2mp + m² + q²

Subtracting the second part from the first:

[4m² -4mp + p² + q²] - [p² - 2mp + m² + q²] 

= 4m² -4mp + p² + q² - p² + 2mp - m² - q² 

Combine like terms:

(4m² - m²) + (-4mp + 2mp) + (p² - p²) + (q² - q²)

Which is 3m² - 2mp.

Therefore, 3m² - 2mp = 9x² - 64.

Hmm. Not sure yet. Maybe another approach. Let me think about angles. The angles at C and at G are equal. Similarly, angles at A and E are equal. So maybe similar triangles?

Looking at angles:

Angle at C (angle B-C-X) equals angle at G (angle F-G-H). And angle at A (angle B-A-X) equals angle at E (angle F-E-H). So perhaps triangles B-C-X and F-G-H are similar? Or maybe triangles involving those angles?

If two angles are equal, then triangles could be similar. For example, if angle at C and angle at G are equal, and angle at A and angle at E are equal, then maybe triangle BCA ~ triangle FGE or something?

Wait, but need to check the correspondence of angles. Let me think.

In triangle B-C-X, the angles would be at B, C, X. But the angle given is angle at C (between B-C-X). In triangle F-G-H, the angle is at G (F-G-H). So maybe triangle B-C-X is similar to triangle F-G-H? If their corresponding angles are equal.

But for similarity, we need more than just two angles. Wait, if two angles are equal, then third is also equal. So if angle at C equals angle at G, and angle at A equals angle at E, then maybe triangles are similar. But need to confirm the correspondence.

Alternatively, since we have midpoints involved. Let me look back at the second part with points F, G, H, E.

From constraints 5-8:

FH = x, FG = 6, H is on GE and GH = HE. So GE = 2*GH. Let me assign coordinates here too. Maybe place point G at origin? Let me try.

Let me consider points F, G, H, E. Suppose point G is at (0,0), and since H is on GE, and GH = HE, then H is the midpoint of GE. So if I let G be at (0,0), then let me assume E is at (2k, 0), making H at (k, 0). Then GE has length 2k. Then FH = x. Also FG = 6. So point F is somewhere such that distance from F to G (which is at (0,0)) is 6. So coordinates of F satisfy sqrt((Fx)^2 + (Fy)^2) = 6. Also, distance from F to H (which is at (k,0)) is x. So sqrt( (Fx - k)^2 + (Fy)^2 ) = x.

So squaring these equations:

FG²: Fx² + Fy² = 36.

FH²: (Fx - k)^2 + Fy² = x².

Subtracting the first equation from the second:

(Fx - k)^2 + Fy² - (Fx² + Fy²) = x² - 36.

Expand (Fx - k)^2 = Fx² - 2kFx + k².

Thus, substituting:

Fx² - 2kFx + k² + Fy² - Fx² - Fy² = x² - 36.

Simplifies to:

-2kFx + k² = x² - 36 → -2kFx = x² - 36 - k² → Fx = (36 + k² - x²)/(2k).

Not sure if helpful yet. But maybe we can relate angles here.

The angles given are measure of angle at G (F-G-H) equals measure of angle at C (B-C-X), and angle at A (B-A-X) equals angle at E (F-E-H). 

So angle F-G-H is equal to angle B-C-X. Let me think about these angles. 

For angle F-G-H: This is the angle at point G between points F, G, H. Since H is on GE, and H is the midpoint, so GE is a straight line with H in the middle. So angle F-G-H depends on where F is located relative to GE. Similarly, angle B-C-X is the angle at point C between points B, C, X. Since X is on AC, so that's an angle formed by CB and CX.

Perhaps triangles involved here are similar? For instance, triangle FGH and triangle BCX? If their angles are equal, then they might be similar.

But need to check the sides. Let me think.

If triangle FGH and triangle BCX are similar, then ratios of sides should be equal. But we know FG = 6, and BC = 3x. Also, FH = x. If corresponding sides are proportional, then maybe FG / BC = FH / CX ?

Wait, but we don't know CX. Earlier, we had that X is the midpoint of AC, so CX = AX = (AC)/2. But unless we can relate AC to other lengths...

Alternatively, maybe triangle FGH is similar to triangle BCX. Let's assume that. Then:

Angle at G (F-G-H) corresponds to angle at C (B-C-X). So angle G ≅ angle C.

Angle at H (F-H-G)? Wait, no. The angle given is angle at G for F-G-H, which would correspond to angle at C for B-C-X. Then another angle? Let me think again.

If angle FGH is equal to angle BCX. Also, angle at A (B-A-X) is equal to angle at E (F-E-H). So maybe triangle BAX is similar to triangle FEH?

Because angle at A (B-A-X) equals angle at E (F-E-H), and maybe another angle?

This seems complicated. Maybe I need to use the Law of Sines or Cosines in both scenarios.

Let me go back to the first part with points A, B, C, X. We have X is midpoint of AC, so AC = 2m, AX = CX = m. Let me consider triangle BXC. We know BC = 3x, BX = 8, and CX = m. So in triangle BXC, sides are BC = 3x, CX = m, and BX = 8.

Using the Law of Cosines on triangle BXC:

BC² = BX² + CX² - 2 * BX * CX * cos(angle at X).

Wait, but angle at X is angle BXC. However, we also have angle at C (angle BCX) which is equal to angle FGH. Not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe using Law of Cosines in triangle ABC? Wait, but X is a point on AC. Let me think about triangle ABX and triangle CBX?

Alternatively, since X is midpoint of AC, maybe use median properties. The length of the median can be related to the sides of the triangle. Wait, but BX is a median? No, because X is the midpoint of AC, so yes, BX is a median of triangle ABC. So the formula for the length of the median.

Yes! The formula for the length of a median in a triangle is:

BX² = (2AB² + 2BC² - AC²)/4

But wait, let me recall the formula correctly. The median from B to AC (so X is the midpoint of AC) has length:

BX² = (2AB² + 2BC² - AC²)/4.

But we know that AC = 2m, so AC² = 4m².

We also have BC = 3x, and BX = 8. So plugging in:

8² = [2AB² + 2*(3x)² - (2m)^2]/4

So 64 = [2AB² + 18x² - 4m²]/4 → Multiply both sides by 4:

256 = 2AB² + 18x² - 4m² → 2AB² = 256 + 4m² - 18x² → AB² = 128 + 2m² - 9x².

Hmm. But I don't know AB or m. So maybe need another equation. Also, since X is the midpoint of AC, and we have angle relations. Let me think about the angles. The angle at C (angle BCX) is equal to angle FGH. Maybe we can relate this via Law of Sines or something else.

Alternatively, looking at the second part with points F, G, H, E. Since H is the midpoint of GE, and FH = x, FG = 6. Let me try to apply the same idea as the median. Suppose triangle FGE, with H as midpoint of GE. Then FH is a median. So applying the median formula:

FH² = (2FG² + 2FE² - GE²)/4.

But FH = x, FG = 6, GE = 2*GH. Wait, but we don't know FE or GH. Let me denote GH = HE = n, so GE = 2n. Then FH² = (2*FG² + 2FE² - (2n)^2)/4.

But we have FH = x, FG = 6. So:

x² = [2*(6)^2 + 2FE² - 4n²]/4 → Multiply both sides by 4:

4x² = 2*36 + 2FE² - 4n² → 4x² = 72 + 2FE² - 4n² → Rearranged:

2FE² = 4x² -72 +4n² → FE² = 2x² -36 + 2n².

But without knowing FE or n, this might not help directly. However, maybe there's a relationship between FE and something else. Also, the angle at E (F-E-H) is equal to angle at A (B-A-X). Perhaps similar triangles again?

Alternatively, maybe the triangles involving the angles are similar. For instance, if angle at A (B-A-X) equals angle at E (F-E-H), and angle at C equals angle at G, then perhaps triangles ABX and FEH are similar?

Let me check. If angle at A (B-A-X) equals angle at E (F-E-H), and angle at X equals angle at H? Not sure. Need to verify.

Alternatively, since we have two pairs of angles equal, maybe the triangles are similar. For example, if triangle BAX ~ triangle FEH. Then ratio of sides would be consistent.

Assuming similarity, then:

BA / FE = AX / EH = BX / FH.

But AX = m, EH = n. From earlier, in the first part, AX = m, and in the second part, EH = n. Also, BX = 8, FH = x. So:

BA / FE = m / n = 8 / x.

But BA is unknown. However, from earlier, when we derived AB² = 128 + 2m² - 9x². Not sure if helpful yet.

But maybe combining with the other part. Also, in triangle FEH, if it's similar to triangle BAX, then FE corresponds to BA, EH corresponds to AX, etc.

Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines in both triangles. For triangle BAX and triangle FEH.

In triangle BAX:

sin(angle at A) / BX = sin(angle at X) / BA.

In triangle FEH:

sin(angle at E) / FH = sin(angle at H) / FE.

But angle at A equals angle at E, and angle at X equals angle at H? Wait, because angle at C equals angle at G, and angle at X and angle at H may relate through some other way.

This is getting too abstract. Maybe I need to find relationships between variables.

Earlier, we had for the first part (triangle BXC):

BC² = BX² + CX² - 2 * BX * CX * cos(angle at X).

So (3x)^2 = 8² + m² - 2 * 8 * m * cos(angle at X).

Similarly, in triangle FGH, angle at G equals angle at C (from the given equality). Let me consider triangle FGH. It has sides FG = 6, GH = n, FH = x. Using Law of Cosines:

FH² = FG² + GH² - 2 * FG * GH * cos(angle at G).

So x² = 6² + n² - 2 * 6 * n * cos(angle at G).

But angle at G equals angle at C from earlier. Let me call this common angle θ. So:

x² = 36 + n² - 12n cosθ.

From the first part, in triangle BXC:

(3x)^2 = 64 + m² - 16m cos(angle at X). Wait, angle at X in triangle BXC is angle BXC. How does that relate to angle at C?

Wait, angle at C in triangle BXC is angle BCX, which is equal to angle at G in triangle FGH (angle FGH). So angle BCX = θ.

But in triangle BXC, angles sum to π. So angle at C (θ) + angle at X + angle at B = π. Not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe express cos(theta) from triangle BXC.

In triangle BXC, using Law of Cosines:

cos(theta) = (BX² + CX² - BC²) / (2 * BX * CX)

So cos(theta) = (64 + m² - 9x²) / (2 * 8 * m) = (64 + m² - 9x²) / (16m)

Similarly, in triangle FGH, cos(theta) = (FG² + GH² - FH²) / (2 * FG * GH) = (36 + n² - x²) / (12n)

Since theta is the same angle, equate these two expressions:

(64 + m² - 9x²) / (16m) = (36 + n² - x²) / (12n)

Cross-multiplying:

12n(64 + m² - 9x²) = 16m(36 + n² - x²)

Divide both sides by 4:

3n(64 + m² - 9x²) = 4m(36 + n² - x²)

Hmm. Now, this relates m, n, and x. But I still have multiple variables here. Need another equation.

Let me think about the other angle equality: angle at A (B-A-X) equals angle at E (F-E-H). Let me denote this angle as φ.

Maybe similar approach with Law of Cosines or Law of Sines.

In triangle ABX, angle at A is φ. Applying Law of Cosines:

BX² = AB² + AX² - 2 * AB * AX * cosφ.

Similarly, in triangle FEH, angle at E is φ. Applying Law of Cosines:

FH² = FE² + EH² - 2 * FE * EH * cosφ.

So:

8² = AB² + m² - 2 * AB * m * cosφ.

And:

x² = FE² + n² - 2 * FE * n * cosφ.

Again, two equations with variables AB, FE, m, n, x, phi. Seems complex.

But maybe if we take the ratio of these equations? Or find expressions for cosφ?

Alternatively, if we assume that triangles ABX and FEH are similar, then ratios of sides would be consistent. For example, AB/FE = AX/EH = BX/FH. Which would mean AB/FE = m/n = 8/x.

So AB = (m/n)*FE. And from earlier, in the first equation:

64 = AB² + m² - 2 * AB * m * cosφ.

But this seems tangled.

Alternatively, maybe combine the previous equations.

From the earlier equation after equating cos(theta):

3n(64 + m² - 9x²) = 4m(36 + n² - x²)

But I need more relations between m and n. Is there any connection between m and n?

Wait, in the first part, AC = 2m. In the second part, GE = 2n. Are there any connections between AC and GE? Probably not directly. Unless there's something else.

Wait, but maybe the triangles ABX and FEH are similar, leading to AB/FE = AX/EH = BX/FH. So AB/FE = m/n = 8/x. So AB = (8m)/(x) * n / n ? Wait, AB = (8m)/x * FE? Wait, if AB/FE = m/n, then AB = FE * (m/n).

But also, from the equation above for triangle ABX:

64 = AB² + m² - 2 * AB * m * cosφ.

And for triangle FEH:

x² = FE² + n² - 2 * FE * n * cosφ.

Let me denote AB = (m/n) * FE. Substitute into first equation:

64 = [(m/n)^2 * FE²] + m² - 2 * (m/n * FE) * m * cosφ.

= (m²/n²) FE² + m² - 2 (m²/n) FE cosφ.

Similarly, from the second equation:

x² = FE² + n² - 2 FE n cosφ.

Let me rearrange both equations:

Equation 1: (m²/n²) FE² - 2 (m²/n) FE cosφ + m² = 64.

Equation 2: FE² - 2 FE n cosφ + n² = x².

Let me call Equation 2 as:

FE² - 2 FE n cosφ = x² - n².

Multiply Equation 2 by m²/n²:

FE² * (m²/n²) - 2 FE n cosφ * (m²/n²) = (x² - n²)(m²/n²).

Compare this with Equation 1:

Equation 1: (m²/n²) FE² - 2 (m²/n) FE cosφ + m² = 64.

Notice that the first two terms of Equation 1 are similar to the left side of the multiplied Equation 2. Let me write:

Left side of Equation 1: (m²/n²) FE² - 2 (m²/n) FE cosφ = Left side of multiplied Equation 2.

So,

Left side of Equation 1 = Left side of multiplied Equation 2.

Therefore:

Left side of Equation 1 = (x² - n²)(m²/n²).

So,

(x² - n²)(m²/n²) + m² = 64.

Factor m²:

m² [ (x² - n²)/n² + 1 ] = 64.

Simplify inside the brackets:

(x² - n²)/n² + 1 = x²/n² - 1 + 1 = x²/n².

Therefore:

m² * (x²/n²) = 64 → (m x / n)^2 = 64 → mx/n = ±8. Since lengths are positive, mx/n = 8.

So mx = 8n.

So we have mx = 8n. Let me note this as Equation (3).

Now, returning to the previous equation from the cosine comparison:

3n(64 + m² - 9x²) = 4m(36 + n² - x²).

And from Equation (3): mx = 8n ⇒ n = (mx)/8.

Let me substitute n = mx/8 into the equation.

First, expand the equation:

3n(64 + m² - 9x²) = 4m(36 + n² - x²).

Replace n with mx/8:

3*(mx/8)*(64 + m² - 9x²) = 4m[36 + (m²x²)/64 - x²].

Let me simplify both sides.

Left side:

(3m x / 8) * (64 + m² - 9x²).

Right side:

4m [36 + (m²x²)/64 - x²] = 4m[36 - x² + (m²x²)/64].

Now, divide both sides by m (assuming m ≠ 0, which it isn't since it's a length):

Left side becomes (3x/8)(64 + m² - 9x²).

Right side becomes 4[36 - x² + (m²x²)/64].

So:

(3x/8)(64 + m² - 9x²) = 4[36 - x² + (m²x²)/64].

Let me multiply both sides by 8 to eliminate denominators:

3x(64 + m² - 9x²) = 32[36 - x² + (m²x²)/64].

Expand right side:

32*36 - 32x² + 32*(m²x²)/64 = 1152 - 32x² + (m²x²)/2.

So:

Left side: 3x*64 + 3x*m² - 3x*9x² = 192x + 3m²x - 27x³.

Right side: 1152 -32x² + (m²x²)/2.

So:

192x + 3m²x - 27x³ = 1152 -32x² + (m²x²)/2.

Rearranging terms:

Bring everything to left side:

192x + 3m²x - 27x³ - 1152 +32x² - (m²x²)/2 = 0.

Group like terms:

Terms with m²x: 3m²x - (m²x²)/2 = m²x(3 - x/2).

Terms with x³: -27x³.

Terms with x²: +32x².

Terms with x: +192x.

Constant term: -1152.

So overall:

m²x(3 - x/2) - 27x³ + 32x² + 192x - 1152 = 0.

This seems very complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Let me think if there are other relations.

Recall from Equation (3): mx = 8n, and earlier we had from triangle FGH's median formula?

Wait, earlier in the second part, we tried to express FE² in terms of n and x. Let me recall:

From earlier in the second part, with triangle FGE having H as midpoint:

FE² = 2x² -36 + 2n².

Wait, was that correct?

Let me revisit that part. Earlier, we had:

After expanding the median formula for FH in triangle FGE, we had:

FE² = 2x² -36 + 2n².

But this came from:

From the median formula: FH² = (2FG² + 2FE² - GE²)/4.

Which gave:

x² = [2*36 + 2FE² - (2n)^2]/4 → x² = [72 + 2FE² - 4n²]/4 → multiplying by 4:

4x² = 72 + 2FE² - 4n² → rearranged:

2FE² = 4x² -72 +4n² → FE² = 2x² - 36 + 2n².

Yes, that's correct. So FE² = 2x² - 36 + 2n².

But from Equation (3), n = mx/8. So FE² = 2x² - 36 + 2*(mx/8)^2 = 2x² - 36 + (m²x²)/8.

Now, from the earlier equation relating AB and FE:

AB = (m/n) * FE. But n = mx/8, so AB = (m/(mx/8)) * FE = (8/x) * FE.

So AB = (8/x) * FE.

From the equation in triangle ABX:

64 = AB² + m² - 2 * AB * m * cosφ.

But we also have from triangle FEH:

x² = FE² + n² - 2 * FE * n * cosφ.

Let me denote cosφ as c for simplicity.

So:

From triangle FEH:

x² = FE² + n² - 2nFEc → 2nFEc = FE² + n² - x² → c = (FE² + n² - x²)/(2nFE).

Plugging this into the equation from triangle ABX:

64 = AB² + m² - 2 * AB * m * c.

Substitute c:

64 = AB² + m² - 2 * AB * m * [ (FE² + n² - x²)/(2nFE) ]

Simplify:

64 = AB² + m² - [AB * m / nFE] * (FE² + n² - x²).

But AB = (8/x) * FE, so replace AB:

64 = [(64/x²) * FE²] + m² - [ (8/x * FE) * m / nFE ] * (FE² + n² - x² )

Simplify term by term:

First term: (64/x²) * FE².

Second term: + m².

Third term: - [ (8m / (xn)) * (FE² + n² - x²) ].

So:

64 = (64/x²) FE² + m² - (8m / (xn))(FE² + n² - x²).

Now, substitute FE² from earlier: FE² = 2x² - 36 + 2n².

So:

64 = (64/x²)(2x² - 36 + 2n²) + m² - (8m / (xn))( (2x² - 36 + 2n²) + n² - x² ).

Simplify inside the last term:

Inside the parentheses: (2x² - 36 + 2n²) + n² - x² = x² - 36 + 3n².

So:

64 = (64/x²)(2x² - 36 + 2n²) + m² - (8m / (xn))(x² - 36 + 3n²).

Let me compute each part.

First term: (64/x²)(2x² - 36 + 2n²) = 64*[2x²/x² - 36/x² + 2n²/x²] = 64*[2 - 36/x² + 2n²/x²].

Second term: +m².

Third term: - (8m / xn)(x² - 36 + 3n²).

So:

64 = 64*[2 - 36/x² + 2n²/x²] + m² - (8m / xn)(x² - 36 + 3n²).

This looks very complex, but let's try to plug in n = mx/8.

Since n = mx/8, let's substitute that into the expression.

First, calculate n²/x²: (m²x²/64)/x² = m²/64.

Similarly, n²/x² = m²/64.

Also, n = mx/8.

Let me proceed step by step.

First term:

64*[2 - 36/x² + 2*(m²/64)] = 64*2 - 64*(36/x²) + 64*(2m²/64) = 128 - (2304/x²) + 2m².

Second term: +m².

Third term: -(8m / (x*(mx/8))) * (x² - 36 + 3*(m²x²/64)).

Simplify denominator of the fraction in the third term: x*(mx/8) = (m x²)/8. So the third term becomes:

-(8m / ((m x²)/8)) * (x² - 36 + 3m²x²/64) = - (8m * 8 / (m x²)) * ... = - (64 / x²) * (x² - 36 + 3m²x²/64).

So simplifying:

Third term: -64/x² * [x² - 36 + (3m²x²)/64] = -64/x² * x² + 64/x² * 36 - 64/x² * (3m²x²)/64.

Simplify each part:

-64/x² * x² = -64.

+64/x² * 36 = 2304/x².

-64/x² * (3m²x²)/64 = -3m².

So putting together:

Third term: -64 + 2304/x² - 3m².

Now, combining all three terms:

First term: 128 - 2304/x² + 2m².

Second term: +m².

Third term: -64 + 2304/x² - 3m².

Adding them all:

First term + Second term + Third term =

(128 - 2304/x² + 2m²) + m² + (-64 + 2304/x² - 3m²) =

128 - 64 + (-2304/x² + 2304/x²) + (2m² + m² - 3m²) =

64 + 0 + 0 = 64.

So the entire expression equals 64, which matches the left side of the equation (64 = ...). This shows that our substitution and steps are consistent, but it doesn't give us new information. This suggests that the equation holds true for any values satisfying mx = 8n, but we need another equation to solve for x.

At this point, it seems like we're going in circles. Let me think if there's another relation I haven't used yet.

Earlier, from Equation (3): mx = 8n.

And from the first part, we had in triangle BXC:

cos(theta) = (64 + m² - 9x²) / (16m).

And from triangle FGH:

cos(theta) = (36 + n² - x²) / (12n).

Setting them equal:

(64 + m² - 9x²) / (16m) = (36 + n² - x²) / (12n).

But since n = mx/8, let's substitute that:

(64 + m² - 9x²) / (16m) = [36 + (m²x²)/64 - x²] / (12*(mx/8)).

Simplify RHS denominator: 12*(mx/8) = (3mx)/2.

So RHS becomes [36 + (m²x²)/64 - x²] divided by (3mx/2) = 2[36 + (m²x²)/64 - x²] / (3mx).

So:

Left side: (64 + m² - 9x²) / (16m) = Right side: 2[36 + (m²x²)/64 - x²] / (3mx).

Cross-multiplying:

3mx(64 + m² - 9x²) = 32m[36 + (m²x²)/64 - x²].

Wait, this is the same equation as before. So it's not giving us new info. Thus, we need another equation.

Perhaps we need to relate m and x through another relationship. Let me think.

Is there any other condition? Maybe from the first part, using the fact that in triangle ABC, with median BX = 8, and BC = 3x, and AC = 2m.

Earlier, we had from the median formula:

BX² = (2AB² + 2BC² - AC²)/4.

Which gave:

64 = (2AB² + 2*(3x)^2 - (2m)^2)/4 → 256 = 2AB² + 18x² - 4m².

But we also have from the other part, AB = (8/x) * FE, and FE² = 2x² - 36 + 2n² = 2x² -36 + 2*(m²x²)/64 = 2x² -36 + (m²x²)/32.

So AB² = (64/x²) * FE² = (64/x²)(2x² -36 + (m²x²)/32) = 64*2 - (64*36)/x² + (64 * m²x²)/ (32x²) = 128 - 2304/x² + 2m².

Substituting this into the median equation:

256 = 2AB² + 18x² - 4m².

Plugging AB²:

256 = 2*(128 - 2304/x² + 2m²) + 18x² - 4m².

Compute:

2*128 = 256.

2*(-2304/x²) = -4608/x².

2*(2m²) = 4m².

So:

256 = 256 - 4608/x² + 4m² + 18x² - 4m².

Simplify:

The +4m² and -4m² cancel out.

So:

256 = 256 - 4608/x² + 18x².

Subtract 256 from both sides:

0 = -4608/x² + 18x².

Multiply both sides by x²:

0 = -4608 + 18x⁴.

So:

18x⁴ = 4608 → x⁴ = 4608 / 18 = 256.

Thus, x⁴ = 256 → x² = √256 = 16 or -16. Since x is a length, x > 0, so x² = 16 → x = 4.

Ah! Finally! So x = 4.

Let me verify this solution.

If x = 4, then x² = 16, x⁴ = 256, which satisfies 18x⁴ = 4608 (since 18*256 = 4608). Yes.

So the value of x is 4. Checking the answer choices, option B is 4.

Therefore, the correct answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we systematically analyzed the geometric constraints and applied key theorems and algebraic manipulations. Here's a structured breakdown:

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Geometric Configuration**

We were given several geometric constraints involving segments and angles. These included:

- $ \text{Length}(BC) = 3x $
- $ \text{Length}(BX) = 8 $
- Point $ X $ lies on segment $ AC $ and bisects it ($ AX = CX $)
- $ \text{Length}(FH) = x $
- $ \text{Length}(FG) = 6 $
- Point $ H $ lies on segment $ GE $, and $ GH = HE $, implying $ H $ is the midpoint of $ GE $
- Several angle equalities:  
  $$
  \angle B-C-X = \angle F-G-H,\quad \angle B-A-X = \angle F-E-H
  $$

These suggest potential similarities between triangles and the possibility of using trigonometry or median formulas.

---

### **Step 2: Use of Median Formula in Triangle $ ABC $**

Since $ X $ is the midpoint of $ AC $, the segment $ BX $ is a **median** of triangle $ ABC $. Using the **Median Formula**, we have:
$$
BX^2 = \frac{2AB^2 + 2BC^2 - AC^2}{4}
$$
Given:
- $ BX = 8 $
- $ BC = 3x $
- $ AC = 2m $ (let $ AX = CX = m $)

Substitute into the formula:
$$
64 = \frac{2AB^2 + 2(3x)^2 - (2m)^2}{4} \\
\Rightarrow 256 = 2AB^2 + 18x^2 - 4m^2 \tag{1}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Expressing Side Lengths in Terms of $ x $ and Other Variables**

From the second part of the problem, involving triangle $ FGE $ with midpoint $ H $, and using a similar approach with the **Median Formula**, we derived:
$$
FE^2 = 2x^2 - 36 + \frac{m^2x^2}{32} \tag{2}
$$

Also, we established the proportionality based on similar triangles:
$$
AB = \frac{8}{x} \cdot FE \Rightarrow AB^2 = \frac{64}{x^2} \cdot FE^2 \tag{3}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Substitution and Solving for $ x $**

Substitute $ AB^2 $ from equation (3) into equation (1):
$$
256 = 2 \left( \frac{64}{x^2} \cdot FE^2 \right) + 18x^2 - 4m^2
$$

Use equation (2) to substitute $ FE^2 $:
$$
FE^2 = 2x^2 - 36 + \frac{m^2x^2}{32}
$$

Then,
$$
AB^2 = \frac{64}{x^2} \left( 2x^2 - 36 + \frac{m^2x^2}{32} \right) = 128 - \frac{2304}{x^2} + 2m^2
$$

Plug into equation (1):
$$
256 = 2(128 - \frac{2304}{x^2} + 2m^2) + 18x^2 - 4m^2
$$

Simplify:
$$
256 = 256 - \frac{4608}{x^2} + 4m^2 + 18x^2 - 4m^2
$$
$$
\Rightarrow 0 = -\frac{4608}{x^2} + 18x^2
$$

Multiply both sides by $ x^2 $:
$$
0 = -4608 + 18x^4
\Rightarrow x^4 = \frac{4608}{18} = 256
\Rightarrow x^2 = 16 \Rightarrow x = 4
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

By leveraging the median formula and carefully analyzing the relationships between the triangles and their sides, we determined that the only feasible value satisfying all constraints is:

$$
\boxed{x = 4}
$$
