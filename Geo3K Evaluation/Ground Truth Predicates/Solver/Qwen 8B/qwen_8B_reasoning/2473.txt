MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to visualize the figure based on the given constraints. Let me jot down all the information provided:

1. The length of line CD is 8 units.
2. The length of line AD is 6x + 2 units.
3. The length of line BC is 10 units.
4. The length of line AB is 9x - 2 units.
5. Point D lies on line AC.
6. Angle at point B between points C and D (angle CBD) is equal to angle at point B between points D and A (angle DBA).

So, we have points A, B, C, D. Let me try to sketch this mentally. Since D lies on line AC, that means points A, D, C are colinear, with D somewhere between them? Or maybe not necessarily between? Wait, but since there's a segment AD and CD mentioned, probably D is between A and C. So the order would be A---D---C, making AC = AD + DC. But DC is given as 8, so AC = AD + 8.

Also, angles at point B: angle CBD equals angle DBA. That suggests that BD is the angle bisector of angle ABC? Wait, no. Because angle CBD and angle DBA are two different angles. Let me think. If you look at point B, with lines going to C, D, and A. So angle CBD is formed by points C-B-D, and angle DBA is formed by points D-B-A. So these two angles share the side BD, and their other sides are BC and BA respectively. Therefore, BD is splitting angle ABC into two parts: angle CBD and angle DBA. And they are equal. Therefore, BD is the angle bisector of angle ABC. 

Therefore, by the Angle Bisector Theorem, which states that the ratio of the adjacent sides is equal to the ratio of the segments divided by the bisector. Wait, the theorem says that if a bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. Wait, more precisely, if BD is the angle bisector of angle ABC, then AB/BC = AD/DC. Is that right?

Wait, the Angle Bisector Theorem states that an angle bisector in a triangle divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. So in triangle ABC, if BD is the angle bisector of angle B, then AD/DC = AB/BC. Wait, but here D is on AC. So yes, that applies here. So according to the theorem, AD / DC = AB / BC. Let me check that again.

Yes, the Angle Bisector Theorem formula is: In triangle ABC, if D is on AC such that BD bisects angle B, then AB / BC = AD / DC.

But wait, hold on. Wait, the Angle Bisector Theorem says that AB / BC = AD / DC. Wait, no. Wait, actually, it's AB / BC = AD / DC? Wait, let me recall. The theorem states that the angle bisector divides the opposite side into the ratio of the adjacent sides. So if BD is the bisector of angle B, then AD / DC = AB / BC. Yes, that seems right. Because AB and BC are the sides forming angle B, and the bisector BD divides AC into AD and DC. So AD/DC = AB/BC.

So applying that here, since BD is the angle bisector. Therefore:

AD / DC = AB / BC.

We know DC is 8. AD is 6x + 2. AB is 9x - 2. BC is 10.

So plugging into the equation:

(AD) / (DC) = AB / BC => (6x + 2)/8 = (9x - 2)/10.

Now, solving for x. Cross-multiplying:

10*(6x + 2) = 8*(9x - 2)

Let me compute both sides:

Left side: 10*6x + 10*2 = 60x + 20

Right side: 8*9x - 8*2 = 72x - 16

Set them equal:

60x + 20 = 72x - 16

Subtract 60x from both sides:

20 = 12x - 16

Add 16 to both sides:

36 = 12x

Divide both sides by 12:

x = 3.

Wait, so x is 3. Then checking the answer choices, option A is 3. So the answer should be A. Let me verify my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, confirming that BD is indeed the angle bisector. Given that angle CBD equals angle DBA, which implies that BD splits angle ABC into two equal parts. Hence, BD is the angle bisector. Therefore, the Angle Bisector Theorem applies here.

Then, AD / DC = AB / BC. Plugging in the values:

AD is 6x + 2, DC is 8, AB is 9x - 2, BC is 10. So:

(6x + 2)/8 = (9x - 2)/10.

Cross multiply: 10*(6x + 2) = 8*(9x - 2). Which gives 60x + 20 = 72x -16. Subtract 60x: 20 = 12x -16 → 36=12x → x=3. Correct.

So x=3. The answer choices include A. 3. So answer is A.

But just to make sure, perhaps I made an error in setting up the ratio? Let me double-check the Angle Bisector Theorem. The theorem states that the angle bisector divides the opposite side into the ratio of the adjacent sides. So in triangle ABC, with angle bisector from B hitting AC at D, then AB/BC = AD/DC. Wait, AB and BC are the two sides forming the angle at B. So AB is adjacent to angle B, and BC is also adjacent. Wait, but the ratio is AB/BC = AD/DC. So yes, that's how I set it up. So that part is correct.

Alternatively, sometimes people get confused about which sides correspond. For example, if the angle bisector is from vertex B, then the ratio is AB/BC = AD/DC. So yes, that's correct.

Another way to check: suppose x=3, then compute AD and AB.

AD = 6x + 2 = 6*3 + 2 = 20. DC is 8. So AD/DC = 20/8 = 5/2.

AB = 9x -2 = 9*3 -2 = 27 - 2 = 25. BC is 10. So AB/BC = 25/10 = 5/2. Which matches. Therefore, the ratio holds. Therefore, x=3 is correct.

Hence, the correct answer is A.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we begin by analyzing the geometric relationships described in the problem. We're told:

- $ \text{Length}(CD) = 8 $
- $ \text{Length}(AD) = 6x + 2 $
- $ \text{Length}(BC) = 10 $
- $ \text{Length}(AB) = 9x - 2 $
- Point $ D $ lies on line $ AC $
- $ \angle CBD = \angle DBA $

This last condition indicates that **line $ BD $** is the **angle bisector** of $ \angle ABC $. This allows us to apply the **Angle Bisector Theorem**, which states:

> In a triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides.

In our case, since $ BD $ bisects $ \angle ABC $, and $ D $ lies on $ AC $, the theorem tells us:

$$
\frac{\text{Length}(AD)}{\text{Length}(DC)} = \frac{\text{Length}(AB)}{\text{Length}(BC)}
$$

### Step 1: Plug in known lengths
From the problem, we substitute:

- $ \text{Length}(AD) = 6x + 2 $
- $ \text{Length}(DC) = 8 $
- $ \text{Length}(AB) = 9x - 2 $
- $ \text{Length}(BC) = 10 $

Thus:

$$
\frac{6x + 2}{8} = \frac{9x - 2}{10}
$$

### Step 2: Solve the equation
Cross-multiply to eliminate fractions:

$$
10(6x + 2) = 8(9x - 2)
$$

Expand both sides:

$$
60x + 20 = 72x - 16
$$

Bring like terms together:

$$
20 + 16 = 72x - 60x \\
36 = 12x
$$

Solve for $ x $:

$$
x = \frac{36}{12} = 3
$$

### Step 3: Verify consistency
Plug $ x = 3 $ back into expressions for lengths:

- $ AD = 6(3) + 2 = 20 $
- $ DC = 8 $
- $ AB = 9(3) - 2 = 25 $
- $ BC = 10 $

Check the ratio:

$$
\frac{AD}{DC} = \frac{20}{8} = \frac{5}{2}, \quad \frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{25}{10} = \frac{5}{2}
$$

Since the ratios match, the solution is consistent.

\boxed{A}
