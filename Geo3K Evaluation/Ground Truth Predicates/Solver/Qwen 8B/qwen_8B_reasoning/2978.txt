MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to make sure I understand all the given information and what's being asked. Let me start by breaking down the problem step by step.

So, we have a circle centered at point P, right? The circle has a radius of 2.0 units. There are several points mentioned: J, L, M, K, N. Each of these points lies on the circle centered at P. That means PJ, PL, PM, PK, PN are all radii of the circle, so they should all be equal in length. Since the radius is 2.0, each of those segments (PJ, PL, etc.) is 2 units long.

Now, there are some lines involved. The first thing mentioned is that point P lies on two lines: Line(J, L) and Line(M, K). Wait, no—actually, it says PointLiesOnLine(P, Line(J, L)), which means that point P is on the line connecting J and L. Similarly, P is also on the line connecting M and K. So, that tells me that lines JL and MK both pass through point P. Also, there's a perpendicularity condition: Line(PN) is perpendicular to Line(PL). So, the line from P to N is perpendicular to the line from P to L.

The question asks for the measure of arc NM (m∠NMP?), wait, actually, the notation m∠NMP might not be correct here. Wait, the question says "Find m ∠N M." Wait, maybe it's m∠NPM? Or maybe m∠N M as in the arc NM? Wait, the original question says "m ∠M P L = 65" and then asks for "m ∠N M". Hmm, perhaps there's a typo or formatting issue. Let me check again.

Original question: "In ⊙P, m∠M P L = 65 and NP ⊥ PL. Find m∠N M."

Wait, maybe it's supposed to be m∠NPM? Because angles are usually denoted with three letters, like ∠NPM. Alternatively, maybe it's asking for the measure of arc NM? But the notation could vary. However, since the angle is given as m∠MPL, which is an inscribed angle or central angle?

But first, let me clarify the problem statement. Given that all points J, L, M, K, N lie on circle P (so they're all on the circumference), and certain lines pass through P. Also, PN is perpendicular to PL. The angle MPL is 65 degrees, and we need to find the measure of something involving N and M.

Let me sketch this mentally. Let me imagine circle P. Points J, L, M, K, N are on the circle. Lines JL and MK pass through P. Also, PN is perpendicular to PL. So, line PN is perpendicular to line PL. Since P is the center of the circle, lines PL and PN are radii. Wait, but if PL is a radius, then line PL connects the center P to the circumference point L. Similarly, PN connects P to N. If PN is perpendicular to PL, then the angle between PL and PN is 90 degrees. Therefore, the angle between vectors PL and PN is 90°, meaning that the angle at P between points L and N is 90°, which would mean that arc LN measures 90° because the central angle corresponds to the arc measure.

But the problem states that m∠MPL = 65°, which is the angle at P between points M and L. Wait, angle MPL would be the angle at point P between points M and L. Wait, no—if it's written as m∠MPL, that's the angle at point P between points M and L. Wait, no. In standard notation, ∠MPL is the angle at point P between points M and L. So vertex at P, with sides PM and PL. So yes, that's an angle at the center of the circle between points M and L. Therefore, the measure of that angle is 65 degrees. Which would correspond to the arc ML measuring 65 degrees, since central angles equal their intercepted arcs.

So, arc ML is 65 degrees. Now, we need to find the measure of arc NM. Wait, the question says "Find m∠N M"—maybe it's a typo, perhaps m∠NPM or m∠NML? Or maybe it's referring to arc NM? Let me think. Since the answer choices are numerical values, and given that angles can be related to arcs, perhaps the question is asking for the measure of arc NM. Alternatively, maybe it's referring to another angle. Let me re-examine the problem.

Original question: "Find m ∠N M." Maybe that's a typo. Perhaps it's meant to be m∠NPM? Or m∠NML? Or m∠NM? But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, considering that the given angle is m∠MPL, which is an angle at P, and the answer is likely an arc measure, perhaps the question is asking for the measure of arc NM. Alternatively, maybe the measure of angle NPM, which would be a central angle.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the arc NM, which would be the arc from N to M. Let me proceed under that assumption, given that the answer choices include numbers like 25, 45, 65, 90.

Given that, let's consider the diagram. Since PN is perpendicular to PL, that gives us a right angle between PL and PN. So, starting from point P, the line PL goes to L, and PN goes to N such that they form a right angle. Since both PL and PN are radii of the circle, the angle between them is 90°, so the arc from L to N would be 90°, meaning arc LN is 90°.

Additionally, we know that arc ML is 65°, as per the given angle ∠MPL = 65°, since that's a central angle.

Now, how do these arcs relate? Let's see. We need to find arc NM. To find that, perhaps we can use the total circumference of the circle, which is 360°, and subtract known arcs.

But first, we need to figure out the positions of these points. Let me try to visualize:

- The circle with center P.

- Points J, L, M, K, N on the circumference.

- Lines JL and MK pass through P. So, line JL passes through P, meaning that P lies on line JL. Therefore, J and L are diametrically opposite? Wait, no. If P is on line JL, then P is somewhere along the line connecting J and L. But since P is the center of the circle, then if line JL passes through P, then P must be the midpoint of JL. Therefore, JL is a diameter of the circle. Similarly, line MK passes through P, so MK is also a diameter. Therefore, points J and L are endpoints of a diameter, and points M and K are endpoints of another diameter.

Therefore, JL and MK are two different diameters passing through P.

Also, PN is perpendicular to PL. Since PL is part of diameter JL, and PN is perpendicular to PL. So, PN is a radius perpendicular to PL. Therefore, PN forms a 90° angle with PL. Since PL is along diameter JL, then PN is perpendicular to that diameter. So, if I imagine PL going horizontally from P to L, then PN would go vertically upwards or downwards from P. Since PN is a radius, N is located at a position such that PN is perpendicular to PL.

Moreover, since we have another diameter MK, which passes through P. Let me assume that the diagram is set up so that these diameters are arranged in some way.

Given that, let's consider coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates will help. Let me place point P at the origin (0,0) for simplicity.

Assume that line JL is horizontal. Let me suppose that point J is (-a, 0) and point L is (a, 0), making JL a horizontal diameter. Then, since line MK passes through P, which is the center, so MK is another diameter. Let me assume that MK is vertical for simplicity, so point M is (0, b) and point K is (0, -b). But since the radius is 2.0, the distance from P to each point is 2. So, coordinates would be J(-2,0), L(2,0), M(0,2), K(0,-2), and N somewhere else.

But PN is perpendicular to PL. Since PL is the line from P(0,0) to L(2,0), which is along the x-axis. So PN is perpendicular to PL, meaning it's vertical. Therefore, PN is along the y-axis. But since N is on the circle, and PN is vertical. So point N is either (0,2) or (0,-2). However, point M is already at (0,2) and K is at (0,-2). Wait, but the problem mentions points J, L, M, K, N on the circle. So if M is at (0,2), then N cannot be there unless it's another point. Wait, but maybe my initial assumption about the placement of M and K is conflicting with N.

Alternatively, perhaps the diameters JL and MK are not necessarily orthogonal. Let me think again.

Since PN is perpendicular to PL. Let me define coordinates accordingly.

Let me take P at (0,0).

Let me assume that line PL is along the positive x-axis, so point L is at (2,0). Then PN is perpendicular to PL, so PN is along the positive y-axis or negative y-axis. Let me say PN is along positive y-axis, so point N is at (0,2). However, point M is another point on the circle, and line MK passes through P. So line MK passes through P, meaning that M and K are endpoints of a diameter. Let me assume that M is at some coordinate, and K is its reflection over P.

But the given angle is ∠MPL = 65°, which is the angle at P between points M and L. So, if L is at (2,0), and P is at (0,0), then vector PL is pointing towards (2,0). Vector PM is pointing towards point M. The angle between PL and PM is 65 degrees. Therefore, the direction of PM makes a 65-degree angle with PL (which is along the x-axis). Therefore, point M is located at an angle of 65 degrees from the x-axis. Since the radius is 2, the coordinates of M would be (2cosθ, 2sinθ), where θ is 65 degrees. Wait, but θ would be measured from the x-axis. However, depending on the orientation, it could be clockwise or counterclockwise.

But since angle ∠MPL is 65 degrees, that would mean that the angle between PL (along x-axis) and PM is 65 degrees. Therefore, point M is located at an angle of 65 degrees above the x-axis. Therefore, coordinates of M would be (2cos65°, 2sin65°). However, since line MK passes through P, then K is the diametrically opposite point of M. So, if M is at (x,y), then K is at (-x,-y). 

But then, we also have point N at (0,2) as determined earlier. Wait, but if N is at (0,2), then the arc from N to M... Well, let's compute the angle between points N and M as viewed from the center P. The angle between PN and PM would be the difference between their angles. Since PN is along the positive y-axis (angle 90 degrees from x-axis), and PM is at 65 degrees from x-axis. Therefore, the angle between PN and PM is 90° - 65° = 25°, assuming that PM is in the first quadrant. Therefore, the central angle between N and M is 25 degrees, hence the arc NM measures 25 degrees. Therefore, the measure of arc NM is 25 degrees, which would correspond to answer choice A.

But let me verify this carefully.

First, confirm the setup:

- P is at (0,0).

- L is at (2,0).

- N is at (0,2), since PN is perpendicular to PL (which is along x-axis), so PN is along y-axis.

- Angle ∠MPL is 65°, so PM makes a 65° angle with PL (the x-axis). Therefore, point M is at angle 65°, so coordinates (2cos65°, 2sin65°).

Then, the central angle between points N (at 90°) and M (at 65°) is |90° - 65°| = 25°, which is the measure of arc NM. Hence, the answer is 25°, option A.

But wait, let me check if there's another possibility. For example, if the angle between PN and PL is 90°, but depending on the direction of rotation, maybe the angle between PN and PM is different. Suppose that instead of point N being at (0,2), it could be at (0,-2). But then the angle between PN (downward y-axis) and PM (at 65°) would be 90° + 65° = 155°, which would give a larger arc. But since the problem mentions that NP is perpendicular to PL. Depending on the direction of the perpendicular, N could be in upper or lower half. However, the problem does not specify, but since the angle given is 65°, which is acute, and the answer choices include 25, which is smaller than 65, it's possible that the arc NM is the minor arc, so 25°.

Alternatively, could there be another configuration?

Another thought: if the angle ∠MPL is 65°, then the arc ML is 65°, as central angle. Then, we need to find arc NM. How do these arcs relate?

We also know that PN is perpendicular to PL, so arc LN is 90°, since the central angle between L and N is 90°. So arc LN is 90°, arc ML is 65°, and we need to find arc NM.

But how do these arcs fit together?

If we consider the entire circle, the sum of arcs around the circle is 360°. Let me try to find relationships between the arcs.

Let me denote:

Arc ML = 65° (from central angle ∠MPL)

Arc LN = 90° (from the perpendicularity of PN and PL)

But we need to find arc NM. Let me think about the positions of the points.

Assuming that points are placed in order around the circle. Let me imagine moving from L to N to M...

Wait, if arc LN is 90°, and arc ML is 65°, how do they overlap?

Possibly, depending on the arrangement of the points. Let me think again with coordinates.

Earlier, I considered point L at (2,0), N at (0,2), M at (something). Let me calculate the exact positions.

Coordinates:

- L: (2,0)

- N: (0,2)

- M: ?

Angle ∠MPL is 65°, so the angle between PL (from P(0,0) to L(2,0)) and PM (from P(0,0) to M(x,y)) is 65°. So, the direction of PM is 65° from PL (which is along x-axis). Thus, PM is at 65°, so coordinates of M are (2cos65°, 2sin65°). Let me compute cos65° and sin65° approximately. Cos65 ≈ 0.4226, sin65 ≈ 0.9063. So coordinates of M ≈ (2*0.4226, 2*0.9063) ≈ (0.845, 1.8126). 

Point N is at (0,2). Now, to find arc NM. The central angle between N and M is the angle between vectors PN and PM. Vector PN is from P(0,0) to N(0,2): direction is straight up along y-axis, angle 90°. Vector PM is at 65° from x-axis. So the angle between PN and PM is 90° - 65° = 25°, as before. Therefore, arc NM is 25°, which would be answer A.

Alternatively, if the angle was measured the other way, but since arcs are typically considered as the smallest one unless specified otherwise, 25° is the minor arc NM.

But let me check if there's another approach using circle theorems.

Since PN is perpendicular to PL, then the angle between PL and PN is 90°, so the arc from L to N is 90°, as previously stated. Arc ML is 65°, given by the central angle. Now, if we can find the relationship between arcs ML, LN, and NM.

But how are these arcs connected? Let me imagine the circle with points L, N, M. Depending on their positions, the arcs may add up or subtract.

For instance, if we traverse from L to N to M, then arc LN + arc NM = arc LM? Not necessarily, unless they are adjacent. Let me think of the circle as having points L, N, M arranged such that moving from L to N to M covers some portion of the circle.

Alternatively, if we consider the entire circle, the sum of arcs between various points equals 360°. However, without knowing the exact positions, it's challenging. However, with our coordinate system, we were able to calculate directly that arc NM is 25°, which seems consistent.

But let me also think about the other points J and K. The problem mentions that points J, L, M, K, N are on the circle, and lines JL and MK pass through P. From earlier, since line JL passes through P, then JL is a diameter. Similarly, MK is a diameter. So J and L are endpoints of one diameter, M and K are endpoints of another diameter. Therefore, points J and L are diametrically opposite, same with M and K. 

In our coordinate system, J is (-2,0), L is (2,0); M is (approx) (0.845, 1.8126), so K is the diametrically opposite point, which would be (-0.845, -1.8126). But this doesn't affect the calculation of arc NM, which depends only on points N and M.

Thus, based on this reasoning, arc NM is 25°, so answer A.

However, let me check if there's another possibility. Suppose that the angle ∠MPL is 65°, but depending on the direction of the angle. For example, if the angle is measured the other way, giving a reflex angle. But in standard cases, angles in circles are considered as the smaller ones unless specified. Also, since the problem provides answer choices including 25, which is less than 65, it makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe the question refers to an inscribed angle? Wait, but the given angle is a central angle (∠MPL), since it's at the center P. So that gives a central angle of 65°, leading to arc ML of 65°. The arc NM, as computed via coordinates, is 25°, so answer A.

But let me check once more for errors in reasoning.

Is there a case where the angle between PN and PM isn't just 25°? For example, if the point M is in a different location?

Suppose that instead of PM being at 65°, it's at 360° - 65° = 295°, but that would put it in the fourth quadrant. However, since the angle between PL (positive x-axis) and PM is 65°, it's more natural to assume that M is in the first quadrant, making the angle between PN (positive y-axis) and PM as 25°, hence arc NM is 25°.

Yes, that seems correct. So the answer should be A. 25 degrees.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $ \widehat{NM} $ in the given circle $ \odot P $, we begin by analyzing the key geometric constraints and applying circle theorems systematically.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Setup**

- **Circle Center**: $ P $
- **Radius**: All points $ J, L, M, K, N $ lie on the circle centered at $ P $, implying that each segment $ PJ, PL, PM, PK, PN $ is a radius of length 2 units.
- **Lines Through Center**:
  - $ JL $ and $ MK $ both pass through $ P $, indicating that $ JL $ and $ MK $ are **diameters**.
- **Perpendicularity**: $ PN \perp PL $. This implies that the angle between vectors $ \vec{PL} $ and $ \vec{PN} $ is $ 90^\circ $, so the corresponding arc $ \widehat{LN} $ subtends a central angle of $ 90^\circ $.

---

### **Step 2: Use Central Angles and Their Corresponding Arcs**

- **Given**: $ \angle MPL = 65^\circ $  
  - This is the central angle formed at $ P $ between points $ M $ and $ L $, so it corresponds to the arc $ \widehat{ML} = 65^\circ $.
- **From Perpendicularity**: $ \angle NPL = 90^\circ $  
  - So, the arc $ \widehat{LN} = 90^\circ $.

---

### **Step 3: Determine the Measure of Arc $ \widehat{NM} $**

To find the arc $ \widehat{NM} $, observe the angular positions of points $ N $ and $ M $ relative to the center $ P $:

- Assume the circle is oriented with:
  - $ L $ at $ (2, 0) $,
  - $ N $ at $ (0, 2) $, forming a 90° angle with $ L $,
  - $ M $ positioned such that $ \angle MPL = 65^\circ $, placing it at an angle of $ 65^\circ $ from the x-axis (since $ \angle MPL $ is at the center).
  
This places point $ M $ at an angle of $ 65^\circ $ from the positive x-axis, while point $ N $ is at $ 90^\circ $ from the x-axis.

Hence, the central angle between $ N $ and $ M $ is:
$$
\text{Central Angle } \angle NPM = 90^\circ - 65^\circ = 25^\circ
$$
And thus, the measure of arc $ \widehat{NM} $ is also $ 25^\circ $.

---

### **Conclusion**

By interpreting the given angle $ \angle MPL = 65^\circ $ as a central angle and using the perpendicularity constraint $ PN \perp PL $, we deduce that the arc $ \widehat{NM} $ corresponds to the central angle $ \angle NPM = 25^\circ $.

---
