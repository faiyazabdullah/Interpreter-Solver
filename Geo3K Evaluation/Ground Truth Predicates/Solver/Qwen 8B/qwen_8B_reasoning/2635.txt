MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given constraints and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the information provided.

The problem involves several points (X, D, T, Q, A, E) with various geometric constraints:

1. Point LIES ON LINE:
   - Q lies on line XD
   - D lies on line XT
   - Q lies on line XT
   - D lies on line TQ

Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me rephrase those:

- Q is on line XD (so line connecting X and D)
- D is on line XT (so line connecting X and T)
- Q is also on line XT? Wait, but if Q is on line XD and also on line XT, then Q must be the intersection point of lines XD and XT. But since both lines share point X, unless they are the same line. Hmm, maybe there's something wrong here. Or perhaps it's possible that lines XD and XT are different, but their intersection is at X. Then Q would lie on both lines, meaning Q is somewhere along both lines? That might mean that Q is X itself? But that can't be right because then Q would coincide with X. Maybe I need to draw a diagram mentally.

Also, there are points lying on circles:

- A, E, T, Q lie on a circle centered at D with radius 2.0. So all these four points are on a circle with center D and radius 2.0. Therefore, DA = DE = DT = DQ = 2.0 units?

But wait, the problem says EX = 24 and DE = 7. Wait, DE is given as 7, but according to the circle constraint, DE should be equal to the radius, which is 2.0. This contradiction suggests that maybe my initial assumption is incorrect. Wait, no—the problem states that E lies on the circle with center D and radius 2.0. So DE is the radius, so DE = 2.0. However, the question gives DE = 7. That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.

Looking back: The problem says "PointLiesOnCircle(A, Circle(D, radius_2_0))", etc., so the circle has radius 2.0. But then later, the question asks for TX when EX = 24 and DE = 7. Wait, but DE is supposed to be 2.0 according to the circle. There's a contradiction here. Unless the radius is not 2.0 but something else? Wait, maybe I misread the notation. Let me check again.

Original problem statement:

"PointLiesOnCircle(A, Circle(D, radius_2_0))"

So the circle is centered at D with radius 2.0. Therefore, DE = 2.0, but the problem says DE = 7. That can't be. So either there's a misunderstanding, or perhaps the radius isn't fixed? Wait, maybe the radius is variable, and the given value is part of the problem? Wait, no—probably the radius is fixed as 2.0. But then DE is given as 7. How does that fit?

Alternatively, maybe the radius is not 2.0 but another value? Wait, looking again, the user wrote "radius_2_0"—maybe that's a typo or formatting issue. Maybe the radius is 2.0, but then DE is given as 7. Which contradicts the circle constraint. So perhaps there's an error in the problem setup, or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the circle is not centered at D? Let me check again. The problem says:

PointLiesOnCircle(A, Circle(D, radius_2_0)): So yes, the circle is centered at D with radius 2.0. Therefore, DE is a radius, so DE = 2.0. But the problem says DE = 7. Contradiction. Therefore, there must be some misunderstanding here. Alternatively, maybe the circle is not centered at D? Let me check again.

No, the problem says "Circle(D, radius_2_0)", so center is D. Therefore, the distance from D to any of the points A, E, T, Q must be equal to 2.0. But the problem gives DE = 7. Therefore, there's inconsistency here. Unless DE refers to something else. Wait, maybe DE is not directly the radius? Wait, no—if E lies on the circle centered at D, then DE is the radius. Therefore, DE should be 2.0. However, the problem says DE = 7. This seems like a conflict. Perhaps the problem meant that the radius is 7? Or maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe the circle's radius is not fixed but depends on other factors?

Alternatively, maybe the points A, E, T, Q are not necessarily all on the same circle? Wait, no. The problem says:

PointLiesOnCircle(A, Circle(D, radius_2_0))
PointLiesOnCircle(E, Circle(D, radius_2_0))
PointLiesOnCircle(T, Circle(D, radius_2_0))
PointLiesOnCircle(Q, Circle(D, radius_2_0))

Therefore, all four points A, E, T, Q lie on a circle centered at D with radius 2.0. Hence, DE must be 2.0. But the problem says DE = 7. So this is impossible unless there's a miscalculation.

Wait, maybe the problem uses different notations? For example, maybe "DE" refers to the length between D and E, but if E is on the circle centered at D, then DE is the radius, hence 2.0. But the problem says DE = 7. Therefore, there's a contradiction. Unless the circle's radius is not fixed, but determined by other conditions. But the problem says "radius_2_0", which likely means 2.0. 

This suggests that there's a mistake in the problem, but assuming that the problem is correct, perhaps I have misinterpreted the constraints. Let me think again. 

Alternatively, maybe the circle is not fixed with radius 2.0, but the radius is derived from some other condition. Wait, but the problem says "Circle(D, radius_2_0)"—this could imply that the radius is given as 2.0, but then DE is given as 7. So this seems inconsistent. Therefore, maybe I need to consider that the radius is not fixed, but instead, the problem is using variables. Wait, perhaps the radius is a variable, and we need to find it based on other constraints? But the problem says "radius_2_0"—maybe that's a typo for radius r, and the actual value is derived through the problem? But without more info, it's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the problem has a different structure. Let me try to focus on the rest of the constraints and see if I can proceed despite this confusion.

Let me list all constraints again:

Lines:

- Q is on line XD
- D is on line XT
- Q is on line XT
- D is on line TQ

Wait, if Q is on line XD and line XT, then Q is the intersection point of lines XD and XT. Since both lines pass through X, then Q is X? No, unless lines XD and XT are the same line. If lines XD and XT are the same, then Q lies on that line. But D is on line XT (which is the same as XD). So D is on line XT, which is the same as XD. So that makes sense. Also, Q is on line XT (same line as XD), so Q is somewhere on that line. Additionally, D is on line TQ. So D lies on line TQ. Let me try to visualize this.

Imagine points X, D, T. Let's assume that line XT goes from X to T, passing through D. Because D is on line XT. Also, Q is on line XD. So line XD starts at X and goes through D. But Q is also on line XT. Therefore, Q is the intersection of lines XD and XT, which meet at X. Therefore, Q must be X? Because if you have two lines intersecting at X, their only common point is X. Therefore, Q is X. But then Q is X. However, Q is also on line XT (which it is, since X is on that line). But then Q being X may cause issues with other constraints.

Additionally, there's a point Q on line XT and on line XD. So that suggests that Q is X. But then Q is also on the circle centered at D with radius 2.0. So if Q is X, then DX would be the radius. But DE is given as 7. Wait, but earlier problem said DE is 7, but if E is on the same circle, then DE should be 2.0. This seems contradictory. 

Alternatively, maybe Q is not X. Let me think again. Suppose that line XD and line XT intersect at some point Q. Wait, but lines XD and XT both start at X. So unless they are the same line. If lines XD and XT are the same, then Q is on that line. But then D is on line XT (which is same as XD), so D is on that line. So Q is another point on that line. So maybe Q is not X but another point. Let me imagine: suppose line XT passes through D, and line XD also passes through D. So if X is connected to D and D is connected to T, then line XD is from X to D, and line XT is from X to T. So if D is on line XT, then line XD is part of line XT. Therefore, Q lies on line XD (so between X and D?), and also lies on line XT. But since line XD is part of line XT, Q is just a point on line XT. Also, D is on line TQ. So line TQ connects T to Q, and D lies on that line. Therefore, D is on line TQ. So points T, D, Q are colinear, with D lying between T and Q? Or Q between T and D? Depending on positions.

This seems complicated. Let me try to sketch coordinates to model this.

Let me assign coordinates to make things clearer. Let me place point D at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since points A, E, T, Q lie on a circle centered at D with radius 2.0, their distances from D are 2.0. So DA=DE=DT=DQ=2.0.

Given that, let's assign coordinates:

Let’s set D at (0,0).

Now, let's consider the lines mentioned.

First, line XD: since Q lies on line XD, and D is on line XT. Let me assume that X is some point outside the circle. Let me try to define coordinates for X. Let me denote X as (a,b). Then line XD is the line connecting X(a,b) to D(0,0). Any point on line XD can be parametrized as t*(a,b), where t ranges over real numbers. But Q lies on this line. Also, Q lies on line XT, which connects X(a,b) to T. Also, D lies on line XT, which implies that D is on line XT. So line XT passes through D(0,0). So T is another point such that line XT passes through D. Therefore, points X, D, T are colinear, with D lying between X and T? Or not necessarily? It depends on the direction.

Since D is on line XT, then T is on the extension of XD beyond D? Or X could be between D and T. Let me assume that T is on the line XD extended beyond D. So line XT goes from X through D to T. Therefore, D is between X and T. So coordinates of T can be expressed as follows: since D is on line XT, and X is (a,b), D is (0,0), then vector from X to D is (-a, -b). To get to T, we go further in the same direction. So T would be D plus some multiple of the vector XD. Wait, let me parametrize line XT. Parametric equations for line XT: starting at X(a,b), going through D(0,0), and extending to T. Let me parameterize it as X + s*(vector from X to D). Vector from X to D is (-a, -b). So parametric equations: (a - sa, b - sb) where s ∈ R. When s=0, it's X; when s=1, it's D; when s>1, it's beyond D towards T. So T corresponds to some s = k > 1. So coordinates of T would be (a - ka, b - kb) = (a(1 -k), b(1 -k)). Alternatively, since D is between X and T, we can express T as a scalar multiple of D from X. Let me think differently. Since D lies on line XT, then T can be represented as a point such that D divides segment XT in some ratio. But maybe coordinates will help.

Now, considering that Q lies on line XD. Since line XD is the same as line XT (since D is on line XT and Q is on line XD), then Q is a point on line XT. Also, D lies on line TQ. So line TQ passes through D. Therefore, points T, D, Q are colinear. So line TQ is the same as line TDQ. Therefore, Q is on line TD. But Q is also on line XD (which is same as line XT). So Q is the intersection of lines XD and TQ. But since D is on line TQ, and Q is on line XD, then Q is a point on line XD such that D lies on line TQ. Therefore, Q is a point on line XD, and line TQ passes through D. Thus, Q is such that D lies on line TQ.

Let me consider coordinates again. Let me fix D at (0,0). Let me assume that X is at some point (x, y), and T is along the line XD extended beyond D. Let me take specific coordinates for simplicity.

Let me choose coordinates where D is at (0,0), X is at (c, 0), so that line XD is the x-axis. Then line XD is the x-axis. Then, since D is on line XT, T is on the x-axis as well. So T is another point on x-axis. Let me say T is at (t, 0), where t ≠ 0. Since D is between X and T, if X is at (c,0) and D is at (0,0), then T would be at (-d, 0) where d > 0. Wait, depending on direction. Let me assume X is to the left of D, and T is to the right. Wait, but D is on line XT. Let me suppose that X is at (-k, 0), D is at (0,0), and T is at (m, 0) where m > 0. Then line XT is the x-axis from X(-k,0) through D(0,0) to T(m, 0). Now, Q lies on line XD, which is the x-axis from X(-k,0) to D(0,0). So Q is a point on the x-axis between X and D, or beyond D. Also, D lies on line TQ. So line TQ connects T(m,0) to Q(q_x, 0) (since Q is on x-axis), and passes through D(0,0). Therefore, line TQ is the x-axis itself, so D is already on it. Therefore, Q is any point on x-axis. But also, Q lies on line XD (the x-axis), which it is. So Q can be anywhere on x-axis. However, there's also the constraint that Q lies on the circle centered at D(0,0) with radius 2.0. Therefore, Q must satisfy the equation x^2 + y^2 = (2)^2. But since Q is on x-axis, its coordinates are (q, 0), so q² = 4 → q = ±2. Therefore, Q is at (2, 0) or (-2, 0). But Q is on line XD, which is from X(-k,0) to D(0,0). So if Q is on that line, then Q must be between X and D or beyond D. If X is at (-k,0), then the line XD extends from X(-k,0) through D(0,0). So Q could be at (2,0) only if D(0,0) is between X(-k,0) and Q(2,0). That requires that k > 0, and Q is beyond D. Alternatively, if Q is between X and D, then Q would be at some point between X(-k,0) and D(0,0), say at (-s, 0) where 0 < s < k. But since Q must lie on the circle centered at D(0,0) with radius 2, then if Q is on x-axis, then |q| = 2. Therefore, Q is either (2,0) or (-2,0). But if X is at (-k,0), then for Q to be on XD, which goes from X(-k,0) to D(0,0), then Q must be between X and D, or beyond D. If Q is at (-2,0), then it's between X and D only if -k ≤ -2 ≤ 0, i.e., k ≥ 2. Similarly, if Q is at (2,0), then it's beyond D(0,0) on the line XD extended beyond D. 

Assuming that Q is at (2,0), since that would be beyond D(0,0). Then Q is (2,0). Then, since Q lies on line XD, which goes from X(-k,0) to D(0,0), and Q is at (2,0), which is beyond D. So this requires that the line XD extended beyond D reaches Q at (2,0). 

Now, moving on to the other constraints. Points A, E, T, Q are on the circle centered at D(0,0) with radius 2. So their coordinates must satisfy x² + y² = 4. 

We know that T is on the x-axis at (m,0), and since T lies on the circle, m² = 4 ⇒ m = ±2. But since T is on line XD extended beyond D, and if X is at (-k,0), then T is on the positive x-axis (assuming previous setup). So T would be at (2,0), making it same as Q? Wait, but Q is at (2,0) as per above. Then T and Q would coincide? That's possible? But the problem mentions points T and Q separately. So maybe T is at (-2,0)? Wait, no. Earlier assumption was that T is on the line XD extended beyond D. If X is at (-k,0), then line XD extends from X(-k,0) through D(0,0) to T. If T is on the circle, then T must be at (±2,0). If we assume T is at (2,0), then Q is also at (2,0), which would mean T and Q are same point. But that's probably not intended. Therefore, maybe T is at (-2,0), and Q is at (2,0). Let me check.

If T is at (-2,0), then it's on the line XD extended beyond D in the negative x-direction. Wait, but D is at (0,0), X is at (-k,0). So if T is at (-2,0), then it would be between X and D only if -k ≤ -2 ≤ 0 ⇒ k ≥ 2. Alternatively, if T is at (2,0), then it's beyond D in the positive direction. 

But since Q is on line XD and also on the circle, if T is at (2,0), then Q could be at (2,0) as well. But that would make Q and T the same point, which might not be allowed. Alternatively, if T is at (-2,0), then Q could be at (2,0), which is on the opposite side. 

This is getting complex. Let me try to proceed step by step.

Assume D is at (0,0), X is at (-k, 0) for some k > 0. Then line XD is the x-axis from (-k,0) to (0,0). Let's say Q is at (2,0), which is on the circle (distance from D is 2). Then line TQ must pass through D. Since Q is at (2,0), and D is at (0,0), line TQ connects T to Q(2,0) and passes through D(0,0). Therefore, T must be such that line TQ passes through D. So if Q is at (2,0), then T lies on the line through D(0,0) and Q(2,0), which is the x-axis. So T is another point on x-axis. Since T is on the circle, its coordinates are (±2, 0). So T could be (-2,0) or (2,0). But if T were (2,0), then Q would be same as T, which is not allowed. So T must be (-2,0). Therefore, T is at (-2,0). So line XT goes from X(-k,0) through D(0,0) to T(-2,0). Wait, but if T is at (-2,0), then the line XT goes from X(-k,0) to T(-2,0), passing through D(0,0). That would require that D(0,0) lies on the segment from X(-k,0) to T(-2,0). So for D(0,0) to be on line XT, which connects X(-k,0) and T(-2,0), the point D(0,0) must lie between X and T. But if X is at (-k,0) and T is at (-2,0), then for D(0,0) to be between them, X must be to the left of D, and T to the right of D. But T is at (-2,0), which is to the left of D(0,0). Wait, that would mean X is at (-k,0) where k > 0, and T is at (-2,0). So line XT goes from X(-k,0) to T(-2,0), and D(0,0) is not on that line unless k is such that... Wait, no. The line XT connects X(-k,0) and T(-2,0), which are both on the x-axis. So the line is the x-axis from X(-k,0) to T(-2,0). For D(0,0) to lie on this line, it must be between X and T. But T is at (-2,0), which is left of D(0,0). So if X is to the left of T, then the line from X to T goes from X(-k,0) to T(-2,0), and D(0,0) is not on this line. Therefore, this scenario is invalid. 

Therefore, there's inconsistency here. Perhaps my coordinate assumptions are flawed. Let me reconsider.

Alternative approach: Let me assume that line XD and XT are the same line. So points X, D, T are colinear, with D between X and T. Then, Q is on line XD (which is same as XT), so Q is on line XT. Also, D is on line TQ. Since T is on line XT, and Q is on line XT, then line TQ is the same as line XT. Therefore, D lies on line XT, which it already does. So this satisfies the condition. Therefore, Q is any point on line XT (i.e., line XD), and D lies on line TQ (which is the same line). So this works. 

Now, given that, let me consider the circle. Points A, E, T, Q are on the circle centered at D with radius 2. So DA = DE = DT = DQ = 2. 

But the problem says DE = 7. Wait, DE is supposed to be equal to the radius, which is 2.0. But the problem says DE = 7. This contradiction suggests that my assumption about the circle's radius is wrong. Perhaps the radius is not fixed? Or maybe there's a miscalculation. Alternatively, maybe the circle's radius is determined by other constraints?

Wait, the problem says "PointLiesOnCircle(A, Circle(D, radius_2_0))". The wording suggests that the radius is 2.0. But given that DE = 7, which conflicts. Therefore, this must mean that the radius is not 2.0, but that the circle has radius equal to DE? Or perhaps the radius is derived from other conditions?

Alternatively, maybe the radius is 2.0, and DE is not directly related? But how? 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read the original problem again carefully.

Original problem:

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS:
PointLiesOnLine(Q, Line(X, D))
PointLiesOnLine(D, Line(X, T))
PointLiesOnLine(Q, Line(X, T))
PointLiesOnLine(D, Line(T, Q))
PointLiesOnCircle(A, Circle(D, radius_2_0))
PointLiesOnCircle(E, Circle(D, radius_2_0))
PointLiesOnCircle(T, Circle(D, radius_2_0))
PointLiesOnCircle(Q, Circle(D, radius_2_0))
Perpendicular(Line(D, E), Line(X, E))
Perpendicular(Line(D, A), Line(X, A))

QUESTION:
Find T X if E X = 24 and D E = 7."

Ah! Here, the circle has radius 2.0, but DE is given as 7. This seems contradictory. But perhaps DE is not referring to the radius, but to the length between D and E? But if E is on the circle centered at D, then DE should be the radius. So this suggests that the problem has conflicting information. Unless there's a misunderstanding in the notation.

Wait, maybe the circle is not centered at D? Let me check again. The problem says "Circle(D, radius_2_0)". Yes, it's centered at D. So DE is a chord of the circle, but not necessarily the radius. Wait, no—if E is on the circle, then DE is the radius. So DE must equal the radius. But the problem says DE = 7, which would mean the radius is 7, contradicting the given radius of 2.0. 

This suggests that there is an error in the problem statement. However, since this is a hypothetical exercise, perhaps I need to proceed under the assumption that the radius is actually 7, even though it's stated as 2.0? Or maybe the radius is 2.0, and DE is not directly related? But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the circle has radius 2.0, and DE is not directly the radius, but another segment? Wait, but E is on the circle, so DE is the radius. So DE must be 2.0. But the problem says DE = 7. This is a contradiction. 

Maybe the problem has a typo, and the circle's radius is 7? Let me assume that the radius is 7, and proceed. Then DE = 7 would make sense. Let me proceed with that assumption, since otherwise the problem is unsolvable. 

So, assuming that the circle has radius 7, and DE = 7, which fits. Let me continue.

Now, with that assumption, let's try to solve the problem.

So, points A, E, T, Q are on a circle centered at D with radius 7. So DA = DE = DT = DQ = 7.

Now, returning to the lines:

Points Q lies on line XD, D lies on line XT, Q lies on line XT, D lies on line TQ. As before, this suggests that Q is on line XD and line XT, implying Q is the intersection of these lines, which are the same line (since D is on both). So Q is on line XD, which is same as line XT. Also, D lies on line TQ. Since Q is on line XD (which is same as XT), and D is on line TQ, then line TQ is the same as line XD. So TQ is the same line as XD, meaning that Q is on line XD, and T is also on this line. 

Let me try to assign coordinates again with this understanding.

Let me place D at (0,0). Let me assume that line XD is the x-axis. Let me set X at (-a, 0), D at (0,0), and T at (b, 0), where a and b are positive numbers. Then line XD is from X(-a,0) to D(0,0), and line XT extends from X(-a,0) through D(0,0) to T(b,0). Q is a point on line XD, so it has coordinates (q, 0) where -a ≤ q ≤ 0 or q ≤ 0 (if extended). Also, Q is on the circle centered at D(0,0) with radius 7, so q² = 49 ⇒ q = ±7. Since Q is on line XD (from X(-a,0) to D(0,0)), and assuming Q is beyond D, then q = 7 would be on the extension of XD beyond D. Wait, but XD goes from X(-a,0) to D(0,0). If Q is on line XD, it could be between X and D, or beyond D. If q = 7, then it's beyond D on the line XD extended. So Q is at (7,0). 

Similarly, T is on the circle, so T is at (b,0) with b² = 49 ⇒ b = ±7. Assuming T is on the line XD extended beyond D, then b = 7. But then T would be at (7,0), same as Q. But Q and T are separate points, so this is not allowed. Therefore, T must be at (-7,0), on the other side of D. 

Wait, if T is at (-7,0), then line XT goes from X(-a,0) to T(-7,0), passing through D(0,0)? No, because if X is at (-a,0), T is at (-7,0), then line XT is from (-a,0) to (-7,0), which is along the x-axis. D is at (0,0), which is not on this line unless -a ≤ -7 ≤ 0, which would require a ≥ 7. So if X is at (-7,0), then line XT would be from X(-7,0) to T(-7,0), which is the same point. Not possible. Therefore, T cannot be at (-7,0). 

Wait, this is confusing. Let me clarify: line XT passes through D. So if X is at (-a,0), and D is at (0,0), then T must be on the line XD extended such that D is between X and T. Therefore, T is on the opposite side of D from X. So if X is at (-a,0), then T is at (b,0), where b > 0, such that D(0,0) is between X(-a,0) and T(b,0). So T is at (b,0), and since T is on the circle, b² = 49 ⇒ b = 7. So T is at (7,0). 

Then, Q is on line XD (which is the x-axis from X(-a,0) to D(0,0)), and also on the circle. So Q is at (q, 0) with q² = 49 ⇒ q = ±7. Since Q is on line XD (from X(-a,0) to D(0,0)), it must be between X and D or beyond D. If Q is at (7,0), it's beyond D on the line XD extended. But line XD goes from X(-a,0) to D(0,0); to extend beyond D, Q would be at (7,0), which is on the same line. 

Thus, Q is at (7,0), T is at (7,0)? No, because T is at (7,0), and Q is at (7,0). This would mean T and Q are the same point, which is not allowed. So this suggests that Q must be at (-7,0). Let me check: if Q is at (-7,0), then it is on line XD (from X(-a,0) to D(0,0)) only if -a ≤ -7 ≤ 0, which requires a ≥ 7. So X is at (-a,0) with a ≥ 7, and Q is at (-7,0). Then, T is at (7,0). 

Now, line TQ connects T(7,0) to Q(-7,0), which is the x-axis. D(0,0) lies on this line, which it does. So this satisfies the condition that D is on line TQ. 

So now, we have:

- D at (0,0)
- X at (-a, 0), with a ≥ 7
- T at (7,0)
- Q at (-7,0)
- A, E are points on the circle centered at D(0,0) with radius 7, so their coordinates satisfy x² + y² = 49.

Now, additional constraints: Perpendicular(Line(D, E), Line(X, E)) and Perpendicular(Line(D, A), Line(X, A)). 

So, the line DE is perpendicular to line XE, and line DA is perpendicular to line XA. 

Let me analyze this. 

For line DE ⊥ line XE: 

Vector DE is from D(0,0) to E(x_e, y_e): (x_e, y_e)

Vector XE is from X(-a, 0) to E(x_e, y_e): (x_e + a, y_e)

These vectors must be perpendicular, so their dot product is zero:

(x_e)(x_e + a) + y_e * y_e = 0

=> x_e² + a x_e + y_e² = 0

But since E is on the circle centered at D(0,0) with radius 7, x_e² + y_e² = 49. Substituting:

49 + a x_e = 0 => a x_e = -49 => x_e = -49/a

Similarly for line DA ⊥ line XA: 

Vector DA is from D(0,0) to A(x_a, y_a): (x_a, y_a)

Vector XA is from X(-a, 0) to A(x_a, y_a): (x_a + a, y_a)

Dot product is zero:

x_a(x_a + a) + y_a * y_a = 0

=> x_a² + a x_a + y_a² = 0

Again, since A is on the circle, x_a² + y_a² = 49:

49 + a x_a = 0 => x_a = -49/a

So both E and A have x-coordinate -49/a. 

Therefore, points E and A lie on the circle, have x-coordinate -49/a, and thus their coordinates are (-49/a, y), where y satisfies (-49/a)^2 + y^2 = 49.

Solving for y:

y² = 49 - (49^2)/(a²) = 49[1 - 49/a²]

So y = ±√[49(1 - 49/a²)] = ±7√(1 - 49/a²)

This requires that 1 - 49/a² ≥ 0 ⇒ a² ≥ 49 ⇒ a ≥ 7, which matches our earlier condition that a ≥ 7.

Now, we need to use the given values: EX = 24 and DE = 7. 

Wait, DE is the distance from D(0,0) to E(x_e, y_e), which is √(x_e² + y_e²) = 7, which matches the radius. But the problem says DE = 7, which is consistent. 

EX is the distance from E to X. X is at (-a, 0), and E is at (-49/a, y_e). Let's calculate EX:

Coordinates of E: (-49/a, y_e)

Coordinates of X: (-a, 0)

Distance EX squared: [(-49/a + a]^2 + (y_e - 0)^2 = [a - 49/a]^2 + y_e²

Expand [a - 49/a]^2 = a² - 2*49 + (49/a)^2 = a² - 98 + 2401/a²

Add y_e²: which is 49 - (49^2)/a² from earlier.

So total EX² = a² - 98 + 2401/a² + 49 - 2401/a² = a² - 98 + 49 = a² - 49

Therefore, EX = sqrt(a² - 49)

According to the problem, EX = 24. So:

sqrt(a² - 49) = 24 ⇒ a² - 49 = 576 ⇒ a² = 625 ⇒ a = 25 (since a > 0)

Thus, a = 25. 

Now, the question asks for TX. What is TX?

T is at (7,0), X is at (-a, 0) = (-25, 0). So distance TX is the distance between (7,0) and (-25, 0):

TX = |7 - (-25)| = |32| = 32.

Therefore, the answer is 32, which is option D.

Let me verify all steps once again to ensure correctness.

We assumed the radius is 7 (due to the contradiction in the problem statement), but since DE is given as 7, which matches the radius, this assumption holds. With EX = 24 leading to a = 25, TX = 32. All steps seem logical. Therefore, the correct answer is D.
