MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given information and figure out how the points relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the constraints provided.

We have several points mentioned: F, H, L, K, M, G, J. The main circle here is centered at point F, so that's important. Also, there are various lines and perpendicularity conditions. Let me go through each constraint one by one.

First, it says Equals(LengthOf(Line(F, H)), 8). So the distance between F and H is 8 units. Then, PointLiesOnLine(L, Line(K, M)). That means point L lies on the line connecting K and M. Similarly, PointLiesOnLine(F, Line(K, G)) implies F is on the line connecting K and G. Wait, but since F is the center of the circle, maybe some of these points are related?

Next, PointLiesOnLine(H, Line(G, J)): H lies on the line connecting G and J. Also, PointLiesOnLine(F, Line(L, H)): F is on the line connecting L and H. Hmm, interesting. So F is on both LH and also on KG? Because earlier we had F lying on KG. Wait, no—PointLiesOnLine(F, Line(K, G)) means F is on the line KG. And PointLiesOnLine(F, Line(L, H)) means F is on the line LH. So F is the intersection point of lines KG and LH?

Then there are points on circles: PointLiesOnCircle(K, Circle(F, radius_1_0)). Wait, radius_1_0 probably refers to radius 1.0? Or maybe radius 1? But then PointLiesOnCircle(M, same circle), as well as J and G. So points K, M, J, G lie on the circle centered at F with radius 1.0? Wait, but the first condition was LengthOf(FH) is 8. If K, M, J, G are on the circle centered at F with radius 1.0, then their distances from F should be 1.0. However, FH is 8, which would mean H is outside the circle. But then there's another condition about Perpendicular(Line(L,K), Line(L,H)), meaning that lines LK and LH are perpendicular. Similarly, Perpendicular(Line(H,J), Line(H,L)) so lines HJ and HL are perpendicular. 

Wait, maybe I misread something. Let me check again. The problem states:

"PointLiesOnCircle(K, Circle(F, radius_1_0))"—so K is on the circle centered at F with radius 1.0. Same for M, J, G. Therefore, FK = FM = FJ = FG = 1.0. But wait, the question says "FK = 17". Wait, hold on! The question says "Find JG." But in the problem statement, there's a part that says "F K = 17." Wait, perhaps there's confusion here. Let me recheck the original problem.

The problem says: "In ⊙F, FH ≅ FL and FK = 17. Find JG."

Ah, okay, so FK is given as 17. But according to the previous constraints, K lies on the circle centered at F with radius 1.0 (since PointLiesOnCircle(K, Circle(F, radius_1_0))). But that seems conflicting because if K is on that circle, then FK should equal the radius, which is 1.0, but the question says FK = 17. There must be a misunderstanding here.

Wait, maybe the notation is different. Maybe the circle has radius 1.0, but FK is not necessarily on that circle? Wait, the problem says "PointLiesOnCircle(K, Circle(F, radius_1_0))", which means K is on the circle with center F and radius 1.0. Therefore, FK must be 1.0. But the question says FK = 17. This seems contradictory. Unless there's a typo or misunderstanding in the problem. Alternatively, maybe the radius isn't 1.0 but another value. Wait, looking back at the original problem:

"PointLiesOnCircle(K, Circle(F, radius_1_0))"

Assuming that radius_1_0 is a way to denote radius 1.0, then yes, FK = 1.0. But the question says FK = 17. That can't be possible unless there's a mistake in my interpretation.

Alternatively, maybe the circle's radius is not fixed? Wait, the problem says "In ⊙F", so the circle is centered at F, but the radius might vary. However, the constraints say that K, M, J, G lie on that circle. So their distances from F should be equal. However, the problem then mentions FK = 17, which would imply that the radius of the circle is 17. But then why does the constraint mention radius_1_0? Maybe there's a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the radius is 1.0, but FK is not on that circle. Wait, but the problem says "PointLiesOnCircle(K, Circle(F, radius_1_0))"—so K is on that circle, hence FK = radius = 1.0. But the question says FK = 17. Contradiction. So either there's a mistake in the problem, or I'm misinterpreting something.

Wait, maybe the circle is not the same as the ones mentioned in the constraints? Let me read again:

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS:
... 
PointLiesOnCircle(K, Circle(F, radius_1_0))
PointLiesOnCircle(M, Circle(F, radius_1_0))
PointLiesOnCircle(J, Circle(F, radius_1_0))
PointLiesOnCircle(G, Circle(F, radius_1_0))..."

So all four points K, M, J, G lie on the same circle centered at F with radius 1.0. Hence, FK = FM = FJ = FG = 1.0. But the question says "FK = 17". That suggests that maybe there's a misinterpretation here. Perhaps the circle's radius is actually 17? But the problem says radius_1_0. Alternatively, maybe the radius is variable, and FK is given as 17, implying that the radius is 17, but then why the constraints mention radius_1_0? This seems like a conflict.

Wait, maybe the user made a typo. For example, maybe the circle's radius is supposed to be 17, not 1.0? Let me think. Suppose that the circle has radius r, and FK is given as 17. Then, since K is on the circle, r = 17. But then the problem says radius_1_0, which could be a formatting error. Alternatively, maybe the radius is 1.0, but FK is not on that circle. But the constraints say that K is on the circle. So there's inconsistency here.

Alternatively, maybe the circle mentioned in the constraints is not the same as the circle referred to in the question. Wait, the question starts with "In ⊙F..." which means the circle centered at F. All the points K, M, J, G are on that circle. Therefore, their distances from F must be equal. But the problem says FK = 17, which would make the radius 17. So the initial constraints may have a typo, and instead of radius_1_0, it should be radius_17? Otherwise, there's a contradiction.

But assuming that the problem is correctly stated, and there's no typo, perhaps I need to proceed differently. Let me try to assume that FK is 17, even though the constraints suggest it's on a circle of radius 1.0. Maybe the problem is using different radii for different circles? Wait, no—the problem says "In ⊙F", so all those points are on the same circle. Therefore, if K is on that circle, then FK = radius. But the problem says FK = 17, so radius is 17. Therefore, the constraints mentioning radius_1_0 must be incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps "radius_1_0" is a way to write radius 1.0, but the actual radius is 17. Maybe the problem had a formatting issue where the radius was meant to be 17, but got written as 1.0 due to some error.

Given that the question asks for JG, and FK is given as 17, I'll proceed under the assumption that the circle has radius 17, and that the initial constraints' mention of radius_1_0 is a typo. So, moving forward, let's consider that points K, M, J, G lie on a circle centered at F with radius 17. Hence, FK = FM = FJ = FG = 17.

Now, the problem states that FH ≅ FL, meaning that FH and FL are congruent, so FH = FL = 8? Wait, the first constraint says Equals(LengthOf(Line(F, H)), 8), so FH = 8. Since FH ≅ FL, then FL = 8 as well.

So, points H and L are both at distance 8 from F. Now, we need to find JG.

Let me try to visualize the diagram based on the constraints.

First, let's note down all the points and relationships:

- Points K, M, J, G are on the circle centered at F with radius 17 (assuming the typo).

- Lines:

   - L lies on KM (PointLiesOnLine(L, Line(K, M)))

   - F lies on KG (PointLiesOnLine(F, Line(K, G)))

   - H lies on GJ (PointLiesOnLine(H, Line(G, J)))

   - F lies on LH (PointLiesOnLine(F, Line(L, H)))

Additionally, there are perpendicularities:

- Line(L, K) is perpendicular to Line(L, H): Perpendicular(Line(L, K), Line(L, H))

- Line(H, J) is perpendicular to Line(H, L): Perpendicular(Line(H, J), Line(H, L))

Also, FH = 8, and FL = 8 (since FH ≅ FL).

Our goal is to find JG.

Let me try to sketch this mentally.

Starting with the circle centered at F with radius 17. Points K, M, J, G are on this circle.

Since F lies on line KG (from PointLiesOnLine(F, Line(K, G))), that means that F is somewhere along the line connecting K and G. Since K and G are on the circle, the line KG passes through F. Therefore, F is the midpoint of KG? Not necessarily, unless KG is a diameter. Wait, if F is on KG, then depending on where K and G are located, but since they're both on the circle, the line KG passes through F. Therefore, F is collinear with K and G, and since K and G are on the circle, then the line KG is a chord passing through F. Thus, F is inside the circle, but since the radius is 17, the distance from F to K is 17, and same for F to G. Wait, but if F is on the line KG, then the distance from F to K plus the distance from F to G equals the length of KG. But since K and G are both on the circle, the maximum distance between them is the diameter, which is 34. But if F is between K and G, then KG = FK + FG = 17 + 17 = 34, making KG the diameter. Therefore, KG is a diameter of the circle. Therefore, the line KG passes through F, and F is the midpoint of KG. Hence, KG is a diameter of the circle, so its length is 34.

Similarly, other points: since H lies on GJ (PointLiesOnLine(H, Line(G, J))), and H is connected to J via line GJ. Also, H lies on line LH (PointLiesOnLine(F, Line(L, H)))—wait, no: PointLiesOnLine(F, Line(L, H)) means that F lies on the line LH. So F is on line LH, which connects L and H. Also, H lies on line GJ. Additionally, there's a perpendicularity between Line(L, K) and Line(L, H)—so at point L, lines LK and LH are perpendicular. Similarly, at point H, lines HJ and HL are perpendicular.

This is getting complex. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, since KG is a diameter of the circle (as discussed), then points K and G are endpoints of a diameter. Therefore, angle KFG is a right angle if we consider triangle KFG, but since F is the midpoint, maybe not directly helpful yet.

Now, considering point L: it lies on line KM (PointLiesOnLine(L, Line(K, M))). Also, F lies on line LH (PointLiesOnLine(F, Line(L, H))). So line LH passes through F. Also, Line(L, K) is perpendicular to Line(L, H). Since line LH passes through F, and line LK is perpendicular to LH, then at point L, the lines LK and LH form a right angle. Therefore, triangle LKF is a right triangle, with right angle at L.

Wait, but point K is on the circle, and L is on line KM. Also, F is on line LH. Let me think.

Since L is on line KM, and K is on the circle, and M is also on the circle. So line KM is a chord of the circle. Point L is somewhere on that chord.

Also, F lies on line LH. So starting from L, going through F, then extending to H. And at point L, the lines LK and LH are perpendicular. So LH is perpendicular to LK.

Therefore, triangle LKH has a right angle at L. So triangle LKH is right-angled at L. Therefore, by Pythagoras:

LK² + LH² = KH².

But we know that LK is part of line KM, and LH is a segment from L to H, which goes through F.

Also, since F lies on line LH, we can express LH as LF + FH. Wait, but FH is given as 8. Since F is between L and H? Or is H between L and F? Depending on the direction.

But since FH = 8, and FL = 8 (because FH ≅ FL), then the total length of LH is LF + FH = 8 + 8 = 16? Wait, if F is between L and H, then LF + FH = LH. But since FH = 8 and FL = 8, then LH = 16. But if F is not between L and H, then maybe LH = |LF - FH|. But since FH ≅ FL, meaning they are congruent, so if they are in opposite directions, then LH would be zero? Which can't be. Therefore, likely F is between L and H, making LH = LF + FH = 8 + 8 = 16.

But wait, the problem says FH ≅ FL, which means FH = FL. So FL = 8, FH = 8. Therefore, the distance from F to L is 8, and from F to H is also 8. Therefore, points L and H are both at distance 8 from F. So they lie on a circle centered at F with radius 8. But the main circle around F has radius 17, so points L and H are inside that circle.

Now, returning to triangle LKH being right-angled at L. We have LK and LH as legs, and KH as hypotenuse.

We need to find LK. Let me see. But how?

Also, since L is on line KM, which connects K and M, both on the circle. Let me recall that M is also on the circle, so line KM is a chord of the circle. Also, since F is on line LH, which we've established passes through F, and L is on KM. 

Another thing: since F is on line KG (which is a diameter), and also on line LH. Therefore, lines KG and LH intersect at point F. So lines KG and LH intersect at F.

Moreover, there's another perpendicularity: at point H, lines HJ and HL are perpendicular. So line HJ is perpendicular to HL. Since HL is part of line LH, which we already said is perpendicular to LK. So at point H, HL is one leg, and HJ is perpendicular to it. So triangle HJL might be right-angled at H?

Wait, not sure yet. Let's think.

At point H, line HJ is perpendicular to line HL. So vector HJ is perpendicular to vector HL. So the lines HJ and HL are perpendicular. Therefore, triangle HJL is right-angled at H. Therefore, by Pythagoras:

HL² + HJ² = JL².

But we might need more relations.

Alternatively, since H lies on line GJ (PointLiesOnLine(H, Line(G, J))), so H is on the line connecting G and J. Therefore, line GJ passes through H. So points G, H, J are colinear with H somewhere between G and J, or extended.

Additionally, since J is on the circle centered at F with radius 17, so FJ = 17. Also, FG = 17, as G is on the circle.

So, considering line GJ, which contains H. Since F is on line LH, which connects L and H, and H is on line GJ. So maybe we can relate coordinates.

Perhaps assigning coordinates would help. Let me try coordinate geometry.

Let me place point F at the origin (0, 0) for simplicity.

Since KG is a diameter of the circle, let me define points K and G such that they are endpoints of a diameter. Let's suppose that K is at (-a, 0) and G is at (a, 0), making the center at F=(0,0). Since the radius is 17, then the distance from F to K is 17, so a=17. Therefore, K=(-17, 0), G=(17, 0).

Now, line KG is the x-axis from (-17, 0) to (17, 0). Point L lies on line KM. But we don't know where M is yet. However, M is also on the circle. So line KM connects K(-17, 0) to M, which is another point on the circle. But since we don't know M's location, maybe we can find it later.

Also, point L lies on line KM. Additionally, F lies on line LH. So line LH passes through F=(0,0). Also, line LK is perpendicular to line LH. Since LK is from L to K, and LH is from L to H. So the slope of LK multiplied by the slope of LH should be -1.

Moreover, since FH = 8, and FL = 8, point H is at distance 8 from F. So H lies on the circle centered at F with radius 8. Let me denote coordinates for H as (x, y) such that x² + y² = 8² = 64.

Also, since H lies on line GJ. Let's think about line GJ. Point G is at (17, 0), and J is another point on the circle (since J is on the circle centered at F with radius 17). So line GJ connects (17, 0) to J, and H is somewhere on that line.

Moreover, at point H, lines HJ and HL are perpendicular. So the line HJ is perpendicular to HL. Since HL is part of line LH, which passes through F.

Let me attempt to parametrize this.

First, let's find coordinates for point L. Since L lies on line KM. But we don't know M yet. However, we know that line LH passes through F=(0,0). Let me consider that.

Let me assume coordinates for point L as (p, q). Then, since line LH passes through F=(0,0), the line connecting L(p,q) and H(x,y) passes through F. Therefore, the three points L, F, H are colinear. So the vectors FL and FH are scalar multiples. So H can be expressed as a scalar multiple of the vector from F to L. Wait, since F is on line LH, so H is on the line extending from L through F. So if L is (p, q), then H can be represented as a point along the line through L and F. Let me parameterize this.

Parametric equation of line LH: Starting at L(p, q), passing through F(0,0), and extending to H. Let me express H as t*(vector from L to F) + L? No, better to use parametric equations.

Parametrically, line LH can be written as: any point on the line can be expressed as L + s*(F - L). When s=0, it's L; when s=1, it's F; when s >1, it extends beyond F. So H is some point on this line. So H = L + s*(F - L) = (p, q) + s*(-p, -q) = (p - sp, q - sq) = p(1 - s), q(1 - s). So H has coordinates (p(1 - s), q(1 - s)).

But since H lies on the circle centered at F with radius 8, then:

[p(1 - s)]² + [q(1 - s)]² = 64 => (1 - s)^2 (p² + q²) = 64.

Also, since FL = 8, the distance from F to L is sqrt(p² + q²) = 8. Wait, FL is the distance from F to L, which is sqrt((p - 0)^2 + (q - 0)^2) = sqrt(p² + q²) = 8. Therefore, p² + q² = 64. Plugging into above:

(1 - s)^2 * 64 = 64 => (1 - s)^2 = 1 => 1 - s = ±1 => s = 0 or s = 2.

s=0 gives H=L, which is trivial. s=2 gives H = L + 2*(F - L) = L - 2L + 2F = -L + 2F. Since F is (0,0), H = -L. Therefore, H = (-p, -q). So H has coordinates (-p, -q).

Thus, H is the reflection of L across F. So if L is (p, q), then H is (-p, -q). Therefore, the coordinates of H are (-p, -q). Also, since H lies on line GJ, which connects G(17, 0) and J(some point on the circle). So line GJ passes through H(-p, -q).

Moreover, we also know that line LK is perpendicular to line LH. Let's compute slopes.

Coordinates:

- L is (p, q)

- K is (-17, 0)

- H is (-p, -q)

So line LK connects L(p, q) to K(-17, 0). Its slope is [0 - q]/[-17 - p] = (-q)/(-17 - p) = q/(17 + p).

Line LH connects L(p, q) to H(-p, -q). Its slope is [-q - q]/[-p - p] = (-2q)/(-2p) = q/p.

For these two lines to be perpendicular, their slopes multiply to -1:

[q/(17 + p)] * [q/p] = -1.

So:

(q²)/(p(17 + p)) = -1.

Multiply both sides by p(17 + p):

q² = -p(17 + p)

But q² is non-negative, so the RHS must be non-negative. Therefore, -p(17 + p) ≥ 0 ⇒ p(17 + p) ≤ 0.

Which implies that p ∈ [-17, 0]. So p ranges between -17 and 0.

Also, remember that p² + q² = 64 (since FL = 8).

From the previous equation:

q² = -p(17 + p) = -17p - p².

Substituting into p² + q² = 64:

p² + (-17p - p²) = 64 ⇒ -17p = 64 ⇒ p = -64/17.

So p = -64/17.

Now, substituting back to find q²:

q² = -p(17 + p) = -(-64/17)(17 + (-64/17)) = (64/17)[17 - 64/17].

Compute 17 as 289/17:

17 - 64/17 = (289 - 64)/17 = 225/17.

Thus, q² = (64/17)*(225/17) = (64*225)/289.

Therefore, q = ±√(64*225)/17 = ±(8*15)/17 = ±120/17.

So coordinates of L are (p, q) = (-64/17, ±120/17).

Now, coordinates of H are (-p, -q) = (64/17, ∓120/17).

So H is at (64/17, ∓120/17). Let's take positive sign for q for simplicity, so H is (64/17, -120/17) if q was positive, or (64/17, 120/17) if q was negative. Wait, depends on the sign of q. Let me clarify.

If q was positive, then H is (-p, -q) = (64/17, -q). So if q was positive, then H has y-coordinate -q, which is negative. Conversely, if q was negative, then H would be (64/17, positive).

Either way, H is determined.

Now, H lies on line GJ, which connects G(17, 0) and J. Let me find coordinates of J.

Since J is on the circle centered at F(0,0) with radius 17, so J satisfies x² + y² = 17² = 289.

Also, line GJ passes through H(64/17, -120/17) [assuming q was positive], so we can parametrize line GJ.

Let me parametrize line GJ. Let me denote G as (17, 0), and J as some point (x_j, y_j) on the circle. The line GJ passes through H.

Parametric equations for line GJ can be written as follows. Let me find the equation of line GJ.

Let me compute the slope of GH first. Coordinates of G: (17, 0); coordinates of H: (64/17, -120/17).

Slope of GH is [y_H - y_G]/[x_H - x_G] = [(-120/17 - 0)] / [64/17 - 17] = (-120/17) / [(64 - 289)/17] = (-120)/(-225) = 120/225 = 8/15.

So slope of line GJ is 8/15.

Therefore, the equation of line GJ is y - 0 = (8/15)(x - 17), since it passes through G(17, 0).

So equation: y = (8/15)x - (8/15)*17 = (8/15)x - 136/15.

Now, point J lies on this line and also on the circle x² + y² = 289.

Substitute y from the line equation into the circle equation:

x² + [(8/15)x - 136/15]^2 = 289.

Let me expand this:

First, compute [(8x - 136)/15]^2 = [ (8x - 136)^2 ] / 225.

So expanding:

x² + (8x - 136)^2 / 225 = 289.

Multiply both sides by 225 to eliminate denominator:

225x² + (8x - 136)^2 = 289 * 225.

Calculate (8x - 136)^2:

= 64x² - 2*8*136 x + 136² = 64x² - 2176x + 18496.

Therefore, left side becomes:

225x² + 64x² - 2176x + 18496 = (225 + 64)x² - 2176x + 18496 = 289x² - 2176x + 18496.

Set equal to 289*225:

Right side: 289 * 225. Note that 289 is 17², and 225 is 15². But let me compute it numerically:

289 * 225 = ?

Well, 289 * 200 = 57,800, 289 * 25 = 7,225 → total 57,800 + 7,225 = 65,025.

So:

289x² - 2176x + 18496 = 65,025.

Bring all terms to left:

289x² - 2176x + 18496 - 65,025 = 0 → 289x² - 2176x - 46,529 = 0.

Hmm, solving quadratic equation 289x² - 2176x - 46,529 = 0.

Let me divide all terms by 289 to simplify:

x² - (2176/289)x - 46529/289 = 0.

Calculate coefficients:

2176 ÷ 289: Let's divide 2176 by 289. Since 289 * 7 = 2023, 289*7.5 = 2023 + 144.5 = 2167.5. Close to 2176. Difference is 2176 - 2167.5 = 8.5. So approximately 7.5 + 8.5/289 ≈ 7.5 + 0.0294 ≈ 7.5294.

Similarly, 46529 / 289: Let's compute 289 * 160 = 46,240. Subtract that from 46,529: 46,529 - 46,240 = 289. So 289 * 160 + 289 = 289*(160 + 1) = 289*161. Therefore, 46529 / 289 = 161.

So the equation simplifies to:

x² - (approx 7.5294)x - 161 = 0.

But exact calculation:

Original equation after division:

x² - (2176/289)x - 161 = 0.

Let me compute discriminant D:

D = [2176/289]^2 + 4*1*161.

First, compute 2176/289. As noted earlier, 289*7 = 2023, 2176-2023=153. 153/289 = 9/17. So 2176/289 = 7 + 9/17 = 7.5294...

So squared: (2176/289)^2 = (7 + 9/17)^2 = 49 + 2*7*(9/17) + (9/17)^2 = 49 + 126/17 + 81/289.

But maybe there's a simpler way. Let me note that 2176 = 17 * 128. Wait, 17*128 = 2176? Let me check 17*100=1700, 17*28=476 → 1700+476=2176. Yes! So 2176 = 17*128.

Similarly, 289 = 17^2.

Therefore, 2176/289 = (17*128)/17^2 = 128/17.

So D = (128/17)^2 + 4*161.

Compute:

(128/17)^2 = (128^2)/(17^2) = 16384 / 289.

And 4*161 = 644 = 644 * 289 / 289.

So D = [16384 + 644 * 289] / 289.

But calculating numerator:

First compute 644 * 289. Let me approximate or find exact value.

But this might be tedious. Alternatively, since we have quadratic equation:

x² - (128/17)x - 161 = 0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [128/17 ± sqrt(D)] / 2.

But maybe there's a smarter approach. Recall that line GJ passes through H(64/17, -120/17) and G(17, 0). So we can find coordinates of J by finding the other intersection of line GJ with the circle. Since G is already on the line and the circle, the other intersection is J.

To find J, we can parametrize the line GJ and find the second point.

Let me parametrize line GJ with parameter t. Let me set up parametric equations.

Vector from G to H is H - G = (64/17 - 17, -120/17 - 0) = (64/17 - 289/17, -120/17) = (-225/17, -120/17).

Parametric equations starting at G(17, 0):

x(t) = 17 - (225/17)t

y(t) = 0 - (120/17)t

We need to find t such that (x(t))² + (y(t))² = 289.

Plugging in:

[17 - (225t)/17]^2 + [ - (120t)/17 ]^2 = 289.

Expand:

First term: [17 - (225t)/17]^2 = [ (289/17 - 225t/17 ) ]^2 = [ (289 - 225t)/17 ]^2 = (289 - 225t)^2 / 289.

Second term: [ -120t/17 ]^2 = (14400 t²)/289.

Sum equals 289:

[(289 - 225t)^2 + 14400 t²] / 289 = 289.

Multiply both sides by 289:

(289 - 225t)^2 + 14400 t² = 289².

Expand (289 - 225t)^2:

= 289² - 2*289*225t + (225t)^2.

So overall:

289² - 2*289*225t + (225t)^2 + 14400t² = 289².

Cancel 289² from both sides:

-2*289*225t + (225t)^2 + 14400t² = 0.

Factor t:

t[ -2*289*225 + 225² t + 14400t ] = 0.

Wait, no. It's:

-2*289*225t + (225² + 14400) t² = 0.

Factor t:

t [ -2*289*225 + (225² + 14400) t ] = 0.

Solutions are t=0 (which corresponds to point G) and:

-2*289*225 + (225² + 14400) t = 0 → t = [2*289*225] / (225² + 14400).

Calculate denominator:

225² + 14400 = 50625 + 14400 = 65025.

Numerator: 2*289*225 = 2*289*225.

Note that 289*225 = 289*(200 + 25) = 289*200 + 289*25 = 57,800 + 7,225 = 65,025. So numerator is 2*65,025 = 130,050.

Therefore, t = 130,050 / 65,025 = 2.

Therefore, t=2. So the other intersection point J is obtained by plugging t=2 into parametric equations:

x = 17 - (225/17)*2 = 17 - 450/17 = convert 17 to 289/17: 289/17 - 450/17 = (289 - 450)/17 = (-161)/17.

y = 0 - (120/17)*2 = -240/17.

Therefore, coordinates of J are (-161/17, -240/17).

So J is at (-161/17, -240/17).

Now, we need to find JG, which is the distance between J and G.

Coordinates of G: (17, 0) = (289/17, 0).

Coordinates of J: (-161/17, -240/17).

Distance JG:

sqrt[(289/17 - (-161/17))² + (0 - (-240/17))²]

= sqrt[( (289 + 161)/17 )² + (240/17)² ]

Compute numerator:

289 + 161 = 450 → 450/17.

So:

sqrt[(450/17)^2 + (240/17)^2] = (1/17)sqrt(450² + 240²).

Compute 450² + 240²:

Let me factor common terms. Notice that 450 and 240 share a factor of 30. Let me compute:

450² = (45 * 10)^2 = 2025 * 100 = 202500.

240² = 57600.

Total: 202500 + 57600 = 260,100.

sqrt(260100) = 510.

Because 510² = (500 + 10)^2 = 250000 + 10000 + 100 = 260,100.

Yes!

So sqrt(...) = 510, thus distance JG = 510 / 17 = 30.

Therefore, JG = 30. Looking at the answer choices, option D is 30.

But let me verify once more.

Wait, 510 divided by 17: 17*30 = 510. Correct. So JG = 30. Hence, the answer is D.

But let me cross-check with another method to ensure there were no errors in calculation.

Alternative approach: Since J lies on the circle with radius 17, and G is also on the circle, the distance between J and G is the length of the chord between J and G. However, since we computed coordinates and found JG = 30, which is larger than the diameter (which is 34), but that's impossible because the maximum distance between two points on the circle is the diameter. Wait, wait! Wait, the radius is 17, so diameter is 34. But our computed JG is 30, which is less than 34, so that's fine. Wait, but how did we get 30? Let me confirm the calculation again.

Earlier steps showed that sqrt(450² + 240²) = 510. Let me check 450² + 240².

450² = 202500, 240² = 57600. Sum is 260100. Square root is 510. Correct. Then dividing by 17 gives 510/17 = 30. Yes. So JG = 30.

Therefore, the answer is D. 30.

But let me check if there's any alternative reasoning. For instance, since J and G are both on the circle, and we found that the distance between them is 30. Given that the radius is 17, and the diameter is 34, so 30 is plausible.

Alternatively, maybe there's a property or theorem that could have led us there without coordinates. For example, since we found that JG is 30, which is 17*something? Not sure. But given the coordinate calculation checks out, I think the answer is D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine $ JG $ in the given configuration involving circle $\odot F$, we begin by analyzing the key geometric constraints:

---

### **Step 1: Understand Key Constraints**

- Points $ K, M, G, J $ lie on a circle centered at $ F $, indicating that $ FK = FM = FG = FJ = r $.  
- The problem specifies $ FK = 17 $, so the **radius** of the circle is $ 17 $.  
- Segment $ FH \cong FL $, and $ FH = 8 $. Hence, $ FL = 8 $ as well.  
- Several lines and perpendicularities are defined, including:
  - $ \angle LKH = 90^\circ $
  - $ \angle JHL = 90^\circ $

These perpendicularities and the fact that certain points lie on specific lines indicate potential right triangles and symmetry.

---

### **Step 2: Coordinate Setup**

Place the circle’s center $ F $ at the origin:  
$$ F = (0, 0) $$

Let’s assign coordinates to other points strategically to simplify computations:

- Since $ K $ and $ G $ are endpoints of a diameter (as line $ KG $ passes through $ F $), we place:
  - $ K = (-17, 0) $
  - $ G = (17, 0) $

This makes $ KG $ a horizontal diameter of length $ 34 $.

Let’s define point $ L $ such that:
- $ FL = 8 $, placing $ L $ on a circle of radius 8 centered at $ F $.
- The line $ LH $ passes through $ F $, and $ \angle LKH = 90^\circ $, forming a right triangle at $ L $.

By setting up coordinates algebraically, we find:
- $ L = \left( -\frac{64}{17}, \pm\frac{120}{17} \right) $
- $ H = \left( \frac{64}{17}, \mp\frac{120}{17} \right) $, as it is the reflection of $ L $ over $ F $

---

### **Step 3: Determine Coordinates of Point $ J $**

We now focus on line $ GJ $, which passes through $ H $ and ends at point $ J $ on the circle. Using parametric equations and substitution into the circle equation, we derive that:

- $ J = \left( -\frac{161}{17}, -\frac{240}{17} \right) $

---

### **Step 4: Compute Distance $ JG $**

With $ G = (17, 0) $ and $ J = \left( -\frac{161}{17}, -\frac{240}{17} \right) $, apply the distance formula:

$$
JG = \sqrt{
\left( 17 + \frac{161}{17} \right)^2 +
\left( 0 + \frac{240}{17} \right)^2
}
$$

Convert $ 17 $ to have denominator 17:
$$
17 = \frac{289}{17}
$$
So,
$$
JG = \sqrt{
\left( \frac{289 + 161}{17} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{240}{17} \right)^2
} = \frac{1}{17} \cdot \sqrt{(450)^2 + (240)^2}
$$

Now calculate:
- $ 450^2 + 240^2 = 202500 + 57600 = 260100 $
- $ \sqrt{260100} = 510 $

Thus,
$$
JG = \frac{510}{17} = 30
$$

---

### **Final Answer**

$$
\boxed{\text{D}}
$$
