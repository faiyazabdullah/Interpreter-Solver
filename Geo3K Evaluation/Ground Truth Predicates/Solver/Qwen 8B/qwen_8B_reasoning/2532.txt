MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out how to find angle x here. So, we have points A, B, C, D, E all lying on a circle centered at point A. Wait, hold on—if the circle is centered at A, then all those points B, C, D, E are on a circle with center A? That means AB, AC, AD, AE are all radii of the same circle. Therefore, AB = AC = AD = AE. So all these segments from A to each of the points are equal in length because they're radii. 

Now, looking at the angles given. The first constraint says that the measure of angle DAB is 85 degrees. So angle at point A between points D and B. Then, another angle given is angle CAD is 150 degrees. So angle at A between points C and D. And we need to find angle EAC, which is x. Also, there's a perpendicularity condition: line AE is perpendicular to line AB. Since both lines start at A, that would mean that the angle between AE and AB is 90 degrees. But wait, since AE and AB are both radii of the circle, but they are perpendicular. Hmm.

Let me sketch this mentally. All points B, C, D, E lie on a circle centered at A. Let me imagine point A as the origin. Points B, C, D, E are around it. Now, angle DAB is 85 degrees. So starting from point A, going to D and then to B forms an angle of 85 degrees. Then angle CAD is 150 degrees. So angle between CA and DA is 150 degrees. Wait, angle at A between C and D? So maybe I should think about the positions of these points around the circle.

Since all points are on a circle with center A, their positions can be thought of as points on a circle with radius r (but since it's a circle centered at A, the distance from A to each is the same). Let me consider coordinates. Maybe placing point A at the origin for simplicity. Let me assign coordinates to make things clearer.

Suppose point A is at (0,0). Let me assume the circle has radius 1 for simplicity. Then, points B, C, D, E are somewhere on the circumference. Let's try to find their positions based on the angles given.

First, angle DAB is 85 degrees. So angle between vectors AB and AD is 85 degrees. Then, angle CAD is 150 degrees. Angle between vectors CA and DA is 150 degrees. Wait, so angle at A between C and D is 150 degrees. Let me try to visualize. If I consider angles around point A, the sum of angles around a point is 360 degrees. However, since points are arranged on a circle, the angles between them might relate to arcs.

But perhaps it's better to use coordinate system. Let me place point A at (0,0). Let me define some directions. Suppose AB is along the positive x-axis. Since AE is perpendicular to AB, then AE must be along the positive y-axis or negative y-axis. Let me check. Perpendicular to AB (which is along x-axis) would be vertical direction. So line AE is perpendicular to AB, meaning AE is vertical. So if AB is along x-axis, then AE is along y-axis. So point E is somewhere along the y-axis. Since E lies on the circle centered at A, its coordinates would be (0, r) or (0, -r). Assuming standard position, let's say upwards, so E is at (0, r).

Wait, but depending on the direction of rotation, but let's proceed. Now, angle DAB is 85 degrees. So angle between AB (along x-axis) and AD is 85 degrees. So point D is located such that vector AD makes 85 degrees above AB. So if AB is along positive x-axis, then AD is at 85 degrees counterclockwise from AB. So coordinates of D would be (cos(85°), sin(85°)) assuming unit circle.

Then angle CAD is 150 degrees. So angle between CA and DA is 150 degrees. Let me parse that. At point A, between points C and D. So angle between vectors AC and AD is 150 degrees. So if AD is at 85 degrees from AB (x-axis), then vector AC is making an angle of 150 degrees relative to AD. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, maybe using the concept that angles around point A. Let me think about the total angles. Let me denote the angles between different points. Let me consider that the entire circle is 360 degrees. The points B, C, D, E are placed around the circle. Let me try to find the positions step by step.

Starting with AB along x-axis. Then, AE is perpendicular to AB, so along y-axis. So AE is vertical. So angle between AB and AE is 90 degrees. Now, angle DAB is 85 degrees. So AD is 85 degrees from AB. So AD is at 85 degrees from AB (x-axis). Then angle between AD and AE (since AE is along y-axis) could be calculated. Let me see. From AD at 85 degrees from x-axis, to AE at 90 degrees from x-axis. The angle between AD and AE would be 90 - 85 = 5 degrees. But not sure if that helps yet.

Next, angle CAD is 150 degrees. So angle between CA and DA is 150 degrees. So if DA is at 85 degrees from AB (x-axis), then vector CA is forming 150 degrees with DA. So the direction of CA depends on whether the angle is measured clockwise or counterclockwise. Let me think. If angle at A between C and D is 150 degrees, then depending on the order of points. For example, if moving from C to A to D, the angle is 150 degrees. So if DA is at 85 degrees from AB, then vector AC would form 150 degrees with DA. Let me try to compute the direction of AC.

Assuming that angle between CA and DA is 150 degrees. So if DA is pointing at 85 degrees from x-axis, then AC is either 85 + 150 = 235 degrees from x-axis, or 85 - 150 = -65 degrees. Which one makes sense? Depending on the arrangement of points. Let me think. Since all points are on the circle, and we have points B, D, E, C.

If we suppose that the points are arranged in the order B, D, C, E around the circle. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe considering the positions:

We know that AE is along y-axis (upwards). Point D is at 85 degrees from AB (so towards upper right quadrant). Then angle between CA and DA is 150 degrees. If DA is at 85 degrees, then CA would be 85 + 150 = 235 degrees from x-axis, which is in third quadrant. Or 85 - 150 = -65 degrees, which is equivalent to 295 degrees from x-axis (fourth quadrant). Let me see which makes sense with other information.

Also, since all points are on the circle, and we have point E at 90 degrees from x-axis (y-axis). So if point C is in third quadrant (235 degrees), then angle EAC would be the angle between EA (along positive y-axis) and CA (at 235 degrees). Let me calculate that angle. The angle between positive y-axis and vector at 235 degrees. The angle between two directions can be found by subtracting their angles from the x-axis. Vector EA is along positive y-axis, which is 90 degrees from x-axis. Vector CA is at 235 degrees. The difference is 235 - 90 = 145 degrees. But since angles between vectors are the smallest angle, so 145 degrees or 215 degrees? No, the actual angle between them is the absolute difference, but since it's a directed angle, depending on orientation. Wait, but angle EAC is the angle at point A between points E and C. So if E is at 90 degrees, and C is at 235 degrees, then the angle between AE and AC is |235 - 90| = 145 degrees. But that seems large. Alternatively, maybe the angle is measured the other way. If you go from AE to AC, rotating around the circle. But since the points are on a circle, the central angle between E and C would be 235 - 90 = 145 degrees. But that would imply that x is 145 degrees, which isn't among the answer choices. So that suggests my assumption may be wrong.

Alternatively, if vector CA is at -65 degrees (equivalent to 295 degrees from x-axis). Then the angle between EA (positive y-axis, 90 degrees) and CA (295 degrees). The difference is 295 - 90 = 205 degrees. But again, the smaller angle between them would be 205 - 180 = 25 degrees? Wait no, the angle between two vectors is the minimum angle between them. So if one is at 90 degrees and the other at 295 degrees, the angle between them is the minimal angle when you rotate from one to the other. Let me calculate the difference: 295 - 90 = 205 degrees. But since angles wrap around 360, the smaller angle is 360 - 205 = 155 degrees. Still not matching answer choices. So something's wrong here.

Hmm, maybe my initial assumption about the direction of angle CAD is incorrect. Let me re-examine the angle CAD. It's the measure of angle at A between points C, A, D. So that's angle between AC and AD. So if angle between AC and AD is 150 degrees, then the direction of AC depends on the direction from AD. Let me think again.

If AD is at 85 degrees from AB (x-axis), then angle between AC and AD is 150 degrees. So if we are measuring the angle from AD to AC, then depending on the direction. Suppose we are going from AD to AC in the counterclockwise direction. Then AC would be at 85 + 150 = 235 degrees. Or if it's clockwise, then 85 - 150 = -65 degrees, which is equivalent to 360 - 65 = 295 degrees. 

But earlier calculation leads to possible angles for x being 145 or 155, which aren't in the options. So perhaps there's a mistake in my approach.

Alternative approach: Let me think about the sum of angles around point A. Since all points are on the circle, the angles between adjacent points add up to full circle. But how many points are there? There are four points: B, C, D, E. But their exact order isn't specified. However, we have specific angles between certain pairs.

Given that angle DAB is 85 degrees, angle CAD is 150 degrees, and we need angle EAC. Also, AE is perpendicular to AB.

Let me try to model this with variables. Let me denote the angles between the points.

Let me consider that from point A, the circle has various points. Let me think of the circle divided into arcs between consecutive points. Let me assign variables to the arcs between points. However, without knowing the order of points, it's tricky. But maybe we can infer the order based on given angles.

Since AE is perpendicular to AB, and AB is along x-axis, AE is along y-axis. So points B and E are separated by 90 degrees. Let me consider that. So arc BE subtends 90 degrees at center A.

Also, angle DAB is 85 degrees. So the arc from B to D is 85 degrees. Because the central angle between B and D is equal to the angle at A between AB and AD. Similarly, angle between CA and DA is 150 degrees, so arc CD is 150 degrees.

Wait, but angle CAD is the angle at A between C and D, which corresponds to the arc from C to D. Wait, no—central angles correspond directly to the arcs. So if angle between CA and DA is 150 degrees, then the arc from C to D is 150 degrees. Similarly, angle between AB and AD is 85 degrees, so arc BD is 85 degrees. 

So let's try to map the arcs. Let me attempt to arrange the points on the circle. Let me assume the order of points as follows: Starting from AB (let's say point B is at angle 0 degrees), then moving counterclockwise, we have point D, then point C, then point E, etc. But need to verify.

But since AE is perpendicular to AB, and AB is along x-axis, then AE is along positive y-axis. So point E is at 90 degrees from AB. So if AB is at 0 degrees, then E is at 90 degrees. 

Now, angle between AB and AD is 85 degrees, so point D is at 85 degrees from AB (counterclockwise). So position of D is 85 degrees. 

Angle between CA and DA is 150 degrees. So the arc from C to D is 150 degrees. Wait, but arc from C to D would depend on direction. If we are considering the central angle between C and D, then the arc length is 150 degrees. So if point D is at 85 degrees, then point C would be located 150 degrees away from D. Depending on the direction. 

Assuming the arc from C to D is 150 degrees. Let me think about the direction. If we are moving counterclockwise around the circle from C to D, then the arc length would be 150 degrees. So if D is at 85 degrees, then point C would be located at 85 degrees minus 150 degrees (if moving counterclockwise). But that would give a negative angle. Alternatively, if moving clockwise from C to D, then arc length is 150 degrees. So if D is at 85 degrees, then C would be at 85 + 150 = 235 degrees. But this depends on the direction of the arc. 

But since we also have point E at 90 degrees. Let me see if these positions make sense. 

So if point C is at 235 degrees (assuming arc CD is 150 degrees clockwise from C to D), then point C is at 235 degrees. Point D is at 85 degrees. Then, point E is at 90 degrees. Now, we need to find angle EAC, which is the angle between AE and AC. 

AE is along positive y-axis (90 degrees), and AC is at 235 degrees from x-axis. The angle between AE (90 degrees) and AC (235 degrees) is the difference between these two angles. Since we're dealing with central angles, the angle between AE and AC would be |235 - 90| = 145 degrees. But that's not one of the answer choices. Hmm. 

Alternatively, if the arc from C to D is 150 degrees in the other direction. Suppose arc from D to C is 150 degrees counterclockwise. Then point C would be at 85 + 150 = 235 degrees, same as before. So regardless of direction, point C is at 235 degrees. Hence, angle EAC is 145 degrees. Which is not an option. So something's wrong here. 

Wait, maybe the arc between C and D is not necessarily 150 degrees. Wait, the angle at A between CA and DA is 150 degrees. That angle is formed by points C-A-D. In terms of arcs, the measure of that angle is half the measure of the arc opposite to it? Wait no, in a circle, the central angle is equal to the measure of its arc. So if angle at A between C and D is 150 degrees, then the arc from C to D is 150 degrees. So that part is correct.

But then why does this lead to an angle of 145 degrees for x? Which isn't an option. So maybe my assumption about the direction of the arc is wrong. Let me consider that the arc between C and D could be the reflex angle (greater than 180 degrees). But typically, unless specified, angles in circles refer to the minor arc. However, in this case, the angle given is 150 degrees, which is less than 180, so probably the minor arc. So arc CD is 150 degrees.

Wait, but if point D is at 85 degrees, and arc CD is 150 degrees, then point C would be located 150 degrees away from D. If we go clockwise from D to C, then point C would be at 85 - 150 = -65 degrees, which is equivalent to 295 degrees (since -65 + 360 = 295). So point C is at 295 degrees. Then angle between AE (at 90 degrees) and AC (at 295 degrees) would be |295 - 90| = 205 degrees, but the smaller angle between them would be 360 - 205 = 155 degrees. Still not matching answer choices. 

This suggests that my current assumptions are leading to inconsistencies. Perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the order of the points. Let me try a different approach.

Let me recall that all points B, C, D, E lie on the circle centered at A. So AB=AC=AD=AE=r. Given that AE is perpendicular to AB, meaning that triangle ABE is a right-angled isoceles triangle? No, because AB and AE are radii, so they are equal in length. So triangle ABE is a right-angled isoceles triangle with legs AB and AE, hypotenuse BE. So angle at A is 90 degrees. Thus, BE is diameter? Wait, no, because in a circle, the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle inscribed in a circle is the diameter. But here, AB and AE are radii, so BE would be 2r. Hence, BE is the diameter. So points B and E are endpoints of a diameter. Therefore, the angle between AB and AE is 90 degrees, and BE is a diameter.

Now, angle DAB is 85 degrees. So point D is somewhere on the circle such that angle between AB and AD is 85 degrees. So from point A, going to B (along AB), and then turning 85 degrees to reach D. So point D is located 85 degrees from AB. Then, angle between CA and DA is 150 degrees. Let me consider that angle CAD is 150 degrees, so the angle between CA and DA is 150 degrees. This implies that point C is positioned such that when you look from A, between C and D, the angle is 150 degrees.

Let me think about the positions again. Since BE is a diameter, points B and E are diametrically opposite. So if AB is along x-axis, then AE is along y-axis, and E is at (0, r), B at (r, 0). Then, D is at angle 85 degrees from AB. Let me represent this as polar coordinates. Let me assume unit circle for simplicity. Coordinates:

A = (0, 0)

B = (1, 0)

E = (0, 1)

Point D: angle 85 degrees from AB, so coordinates (cos(85°), sin(85°)) ≈ (cos(85), sin(85)).

Now, angle CAD is 150 degrees. So angle between CA and DA is 150 degrees. Let me find coordinates of point C.

The angle between vectors AC and AD is 150 degrees. So, using vector math, the cosine of the angle between AC and AD is equal to the dot product divided by the product of magnitudes. Since AC and AD are both radii, their lengths are equal (say, length r). Let's take r=1 for simplicity.

So cos(theta) = (AC · AD)/(|AC||AD|) = AC · AD / (1*1) = AC · AD.

Theta is 150 degrees, so cos(150°) = -√3/2 ≈ -0.866.

Therefore, AC · AD = -√3/2.

But AC · AD = |AC||AD|cos(theta) = cos(theta) * (|AC||AD|) = cos(theta)*1*1 = cos(theta). Wait, but theta is 150 degrees. So AC · AD = cos(150°) = -√3/2.

But AC is a vector from A to C, and AD is vector from A to D. So if I write AC as (cx, cy), and AD as (dx, dy), then their dot product is cx*dx + cy*dy = -√3/2.

But we also know that D is at (cos(85°), sin(85°)). So dx = cos(85°), dy = sin(85°).

Let me denote point C as (cos(theta), sin(theta)), since it's on the circle centered at A. So theta is the angle for point C from x-axis.

Thus, the dot product AC · AD = cos(theta)*cos(85°) + sin(theta)*sin(85°) = cos(theta - 85°) = cos(150°).

Wait! Using the identity cos(a - b) = cos(a)cos(b) + sin(a)sin(b). So the dot product equals cos(theta - 85°). And we set this equal to cos(150°). So:

cos(theta - 85°) = cos(150°)

Which implies that theta - 85° = ±150° + 360°k, where k is integer.

So solving for theta:

theta = 85° ± 150° + 360°k.

Possible solutions within 0° to 360°:

Case 1: theta = 85° + 150° = 235°

Case 2: theta = 85° - 150° = -65°, which is equivalent to 295° (since -65 + 360 = 295°)

So point C is either at 235° or 295°.

Now, we need to determine which one is correct based on other constraints.

We also have point E at 90°, since it's along the y-axis. We need to find angle EAC, which is the angle between vectors AE and AC.

Vector AE is from A to E: (0,1) in our unit circle setup.

Vector AC is from A to C: either (cos(235°), sin(235°)) or (cos(295°), sin(295°)).

Let's calculate angle between AE (which is along positive y-axis, 90°) and AC.

For point C at 235°:

The angle between AE (90°) and AC (235°) is 235° - 90° = 145°. But since angles between vectors are always the smallest angle, we check if this is acute or obtuse. 145° is obtuse, but the angle between two vectors is defined as the smallest angle between them, which would be 180° - 145° = 35°? Wait no. Wait, the angle between two vectors is the smallest angle you can get by rotating one to the other. So if the angle between them is 145°, then the smaller angle is actually 360° - 145° = 215°, no—that’s not right. Wait, no. The angle between two vectors is always between 0° and 180°. So if the difference is 145°, that's already the angle between them. But since it's more than 90°, it's obtuse. However, in our problem statement, angle EAC is x. So if the angle is 145°, but that's not among the options. But if point C is at 295°, let's check.

Point C at 295°: angle between AE (90°) and AC (295°). The difference is 295° - 90° = 205°, but the smaller angle would be 360° - 205° = 155°. Still not matching answer choices.

Hmm. Neither 145 nor 155 are options. The options are A. 30, B. 35, C. 45, D. 85. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the angle between AE and AC. Let me think again. The angle between AE and AC is the angle at point A between points E and C. So if point C is at 235°, and point E is at 90°, then the angle EAC is the angle between AE (from A to E) and AC (from A to C). So visually, if E is at 90°, and C is at 235°, then the angle between them is indeed 235° - 90° = 145°, but since that's larger than 180°, we subtract from 360° to get the smaller angle. Wait, no. When measuring the angle between two vectors originating at the same point, it's the smallest angle between them. So if you have two vectors at angles θ1 and θ2, the angle between them is |θ1 - θ2| if it's ≤ 180°, otherwise 360° - |θ1 - θ2|. 

In this case, for point C at 235°, the difference between 235° and 90° is 145°, which is less than 180°, so that's the angle. So x = 145°, which is not an option. For point C at 295°, difference is 295° - 90° = 205°, which is greater than 180°, so the smaller angle is 360° - 205° = 155°, still not matching.

So this suggests that there's a mistake in my reasoning. Let me double-check.

Earlier, I assumed that angle between CA and DA is 150°, which led us to point C being at 235° or 295°. But maybe there's another interpretation of the angle CAD. Could it be that angle CAD refers to the reflex angle? Like, if the angle is measured the other way around?

Wait, angle CAD is the measure of the angle at A between points C, A, D. So it's the internal angle formed at A by points C and D. In a circle, if the points are arranged such that the angle is less than 180°, it's the minor arc. But if it's reflex, it would be major arc. However, the problem states that the measure is 150°, which is less than 180°, so it should be the minor arc. Hence, the arc CD is 150°, leading to point C being at 235° or 295°, as before.

But then why isn't the resulting angle x matching the options? Let me check if there's another constraint I missed.

We also have point E on the circle, and AE is perpendicular to AB. So AE is along y-axis, as discussed. Is there any other relationship between the points?

Wait, maybe the points are arranged in a particular order. Let me consider the positions of points B, D, C, E.

We know that point B is at 0°, D is at 85°, E is at 90°. Now, point C is either at 235° or 295°. Let me see the order.

If point C is at 235°, then the order around the circle from B (0°) would be B → D (85°) → ... → C (235°) → E (90°)? Wait, no, because E is at 90°, which is between D (85°) and C (235°)? No, 90° is between D (85°) and 90°, then goes to 235°. So the order would be B (0°), D (85°), E (90°), then moving counterclockwise, passing through C (235°)? Not sure.

Alternatively, if point C is at 295°, which is in the fourth quadrant, then the order would be B (0°), D (85°), E (90°), then C (295°) in the fourth quadrant. 

But how does this help? Let me try to think of the angle EAC. If point C is at 295°, then vector AC is pointing to the fourth quadrant. AE is pointing to the positive y-axis. So the angle between AE and AC would be from positive y-axis down to AC in the fourth quadrant. Let me calculate this angle.

From positive y-axis (90°) to point C at 295°, which is 295° - 90° = 205° clockwise, or equivalently, 155° counterclockwise. Wait, no. If you're at the positive y-axis (90°) and want to get to 295°, you can go clockwise 205°, or counterclockwise 155°. Since angles between vectors are the smallest angle, it's 155°, which is still not an option.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the angle between CA and DA is 150°, which gives us the arc CD as 150°. Let me recheck that.

In a circle, the central angle between two points is equal to the measure of the arc between them. So if angle at A between points C and D is 150°, then arc CD is 150°. Yes. So that part is correct.

Hmm. This is perplexing. Maybe I need to revisit the angle calculation for x.

Wait, perhaps the question asks for angle EAC, which is the angle at A between E and C. So it's the angle between AE and AC. If I can find the angle between these two vectors, which is x.

Let me consider both possibilities for point C.

Case 1: C at 235°

Vector AE is at 90°, vector AC is at 235°. The angle between them is 235° - 90° = 145°. But this is not an option.

Case 2: C at 295°

Vector AE at 90°, vector AC at 295°. The angle between them is 295° - 90° = 205°, but the smaller angle is 360° - 205° = 155°. Still not matching.

But none of these match the options. What's wrong here?

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the angle between vectors. Let me think differently. Let me use coordinates to compute the angle.

Take point C at 235°, which is (cos(235°), sin(235°)).

Vector AE is (0,1).

Vector AC is (cos(235°), sin(235°)).

The angle between AE and AC can be found using the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (AE · AC) / (|AE| |AC|)

Since AE is (0,1) and AC is (cos(235°), sin(235°)), their dot product is 0*cos(235°) + 1*sin(235°) = sin(235°).

The magnitude of both vectors is 1, so:

cos(theta) = sin(235°)

Calculate sin(235°): 235° is in the third quadrant, reference angle is 235 - 180 = 55°, so sin(235°) = -sin(55°) ≈ -0.8192.

So cos(theta) ≈ -0.8192, which means theta ≈ arccos(-0.8192) ≈ 145°, which matches previous calculation.

Similarly, if point C is at 295°, then vector AC is (cos(295°), sin(295°)).

Dot product with AE is sin(295°). 295° is in fourth quadrant, reference angle 360-295=65°, so sin(295°)= -sin(65°) ≈ -0.9063.

Thus, cos(theta) ≈ -0.9063, so theta ≈ arccos(-0.9063) ≈ 155°, as before.

Still not matching options. So what's the issue?

Maybe there's an error in interpreting the given angles. Let me re-read the problem.

The given angles are:

MeasureOf(Angle(D, A, B)) = 85° — this is angle at A between D and B, i.e., ∠DAB = 85°.

MeasureOf(Angle(C, A, D)) = 150° — this is angle at A between C and D, i.e., ∠CAD = 150°.

Perpendicular(Line(A,E), Line(A,B)) — so AE ⊥ AB.

So, all correct. So why isn't x matching?

Wait, perhaps I misread the angle CAD. Is it ∠CAD or ∠DAC? Let me confirm. Angle(C, A, D) means the angle at A between points C, A, D. So it's ∠CAD. So yes, angle between CA and DA is 150°.

Wait, but what if the angle is the reflex angle? Like, if the angle is measured in the other direction, giving a reflex angle of 150°, which would mean the arc is 360 - 150 = 210°? No, because the reflex angle would be greater than 180°, but the problem specifies MeasureOf(angle) is 150°, which is less than 180°, so it must be the non-reflex angle.

Wait, but what if the points are arranged such that the angle CAD is 150°, but the arc CD is 150°, but due to overlapping points, the actual configuration allows for a different calculation?

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider the sum of angles around point A. Let me consider all the angles around point A.

Points B, C, D, E are on the circle. Let me assume they are in the order B, D, E, C around the circle. Or some other order. Let me try to find the total angles.

We know that angle DAB = 85°, so from AB to AD is 85°.

Angle between CA and DA is 150°, so from DA to CA is 150°. 

Also, AE is perpendicular to AB, so angle between AB and AE is 90°.

Let me try to build the sequence of angles around point A.

Start from AB (0°), then to AD is +85°, then from AD to AC is +150°, then from AC to AE? Wait, not sure. Let me think step by step.

Imagine standing at point A, facing along AB (towards B). Turning 85° towards D. Then, from AD, turning 150° to face CA. Then, from CA, what's next?

But also, AE is at 90° from AB. So from AB, turn 90° to face AE. So the angle from AB to AE is 90°. 

Let me try to plot these angles:

From AB to AD: 85°

From AD to CA: 150°

From CA to AE: ?

But also, from AB to AE is 90°. So the total angle from AB to AE should be equal to the sum of angles from AB to AD, AD to CA, CA to AE? Or not necessarily, because the path might overlap.

Alternatively, let me think of the full circle as the sum of all angles between successive points.

But without knowing the order of points, it's challenging. Let me try to assume the order of points around the circle. Let's say the points are arranged in the order B, D, E, C around the circle. Let's see.

From AB to AD: 85°, so AD is 85° from AB.

From AD to AE: ? Let me see. If E is at 90° from AB, and AD is at 85°, then the angle from AD to AE is 90° - 85° = 5°.

From AE to AC: ? Let's say from AE to AC is some angle, and from AC to AD is 150°? Wait, no. The angle between CA and DA is 150°, so from CA to DA is 150°, but depending on direction.

This is getting too vague. Maybe it's time to think of the total angles.

Total around point A is 360°. Let me consider the angles between successive points.

Assume the points are ordered B, D, E, C around the circle. Then the angles between them would be:

Between B and D: 85° (given).

Between D and E: let's call this α.

Between E and C: β.

Between C and B: γ.

And α + β + γ = 360° - 85° = 275°.

But we also know that AE is perpendicular to AB, so the angle between AB and AE is 90°, which would correspond to the sum of angles from B to E. If the order is B, D, E, then the angle from B to E would be angle between AB and AE, which is 90°. So the angle from B to D is 85°, and from D to E is α, so 85° + α = 90° => α = 5°. So between D and E is 5°.

Then, from E to C is β, and from C back to B is γ. Total of β + γ = 275° - 5° = 270°?

Wait, total of α + β + γ = 275°, and α is 5°, so β + γ = 270°.

Now, we also know that angle between CA and DA is 150°. Let's think about that. Angle CAD is 150°, which is the angle at A between C and D. If the points are ordered B, D, E, C, then from D to C would pass through E? Or not? Let me visualize.

If the order is B -> D -> E -> C -> B, then from D to C passes through E. So the angle between D and C would be the sum of the angle from D to E (5°) and from E to C (β). So total angle from D to C is 5° + β. But angle CAD is the angle between CA and DA, which would be the angle from D to C passing through E, which is 5° + β. But this angle is supposed to be 150°, so 5° + β = 150° => β = 145°. Then γ would be 270° - β = 270° - 145° = 125°. 

Now, we need to find angle EAC, which is the angle at A between E and C. In this scenario, from E to C is β = 145°, so the angle between AE and AC is 145°, which is not an option. But this contradicts the options.

Alternatively, if the angle between CA and DA is the other way around, like going from C to D through the other side of the circle. In that case, the angle would be 360° - (5° + β) = 360° - 150° = 210°, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the angle between CA and DA is the reflex angle, but the problem states it's 150°, so that's not possible.

Wait, but if β is 145°, then the angle between E and C is 145°, which is x. But x is not an option. So this suggests there's a contradiction, implying my assumption about the order of points is wrong.

Let me try a different order. Suppose the points are arranged as B, E, D, C.

From AB to AE is 90°, as given. Then from AE to AD: let's say the angle between AE and AD is some value. Given that angle DAB is 85°, so from AB to AD is 85°. Since AB to AE is 90°, then from AE to AD would be 85° - 90° = -5°, which is equivalent to 355°, but that might not help.

Alternatively, if the order is B, E, D, C. Let me try to calculate.

From B to E: 90° (since AE is perpendicular to AB).

From E to D: let's call this alpha.

From D to C: beta.

From C back to B: gamma.

Total of alpha + beta + gamma = 360° - 90° = 270°.

Also, angle DAB is 85°, which is from AB to AD. Since AD is part of the path from B to D. If the order is B, E, D, C, then from B to D would pass through E. So the angle from B to D is angle between AB and AD, which is 85°. This would be the sum of angle from B to E (90°) and from E to D (alpha), but since it's a circle, this would require that 90° + alpha = 85°, which implies alpha = -5°, which is impossible. So this ordering is invalid.

Another possibility: points are arranged as B, C, D, E. Let me try.

From B to C: let's say alpha.

From C to D: beta.

From D to E: gamma.

From E back to B: delta.

Total alpha + beta + gamma + delta = 360°.

Given angle DAB = 85°, which is from AB to AD. If the order is B, C, D, E, then AD is from A to D, which would pass through C. So angle from AB to AD is the sum of angle from AB to AC (alpha) and from AC to AD (beta). So alpha + beta = 85°.

Also, angle between CA and DA is 150°, which would be the angle at A between C and D, which is beta. Wait, no. If the points are B, C, D, E, then angle CAD is the angle at A between C and D, which is beta. So beta = 150°. But then alpha + 150° = 85° ⇒ alpha = -65°, which is impossible.

Hmm. Another possibility: points are arranged as B, D, C, E.

From B to D: 85° (as given).

From D to C: let's call this beta.

From C to E: gamma.

From E back to B: delta.

Total: 85 + beta + gamma + delta = 360.

Also, angle between CA and DA is 150°. If the order is B, D, C, E, then from D to C is beta, and from C to D would be the reflex angle, but the angle at A between C and D is 150°, which would be the smaller arc. So if beta is the angle from D to C, then beta = 150°. So beta = 150°. Then, remaining angles gamma + delta = 360 - 85 - 150 = 125°.

Also, AE is perpendicular to AB, so angle from AB to AE is 90°. Let's see. If the order is B, D, C, E, then from B to E would pass through D and C. So the angle from B to E is 85° (BD) + 150° (DC) + gamma (CE)? No, because from B to D is 85°, from D to C is 150°, then from C to E is gamma. So total from B to E is 85° + 150° + gamma. But this should equal 90°, since AE is at 90° from AB. So 85 + 150 + gamma = 90 ⇒ gamma = 90 - 235 = -145°, which is impossible.

This is getting too convoluted. Perhaps there's another approach.

Let me recall that in a circle, the angle between two chords can be related to the arcs. Specifically, the measure of an angle formed by two chords intersecting at a point on the circle is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. Wait, no—actually, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. But here, the angle is at the center, so it's just the measure of the arc.

Wait, but in this case, angle at A is a central angle, so it's equal to the measure of the arc. So angle DAB = 85° implies arc DB is 85°. Angle CAD = 150° implies arc CD is 150°. Also, AE is perpendicular to AB, so arc BE is 90° (since it's a semicircle? No, because AE is a radius, and AB is a radius, so the arc BE would be 90° if BE is a quarter-circle. Wait, if AB and AE are radii and are perpendicular, then the arc from B to E is 90°. So arc BE = 90°.

Now, let's try to find the total arc lengths.

Arc DB = 85°

Arc CD = 150°

Arc BE = 90°

Now, we need to find arc EC, which would be the arc from E to C, which is x, since angle EAC is the central angle over arc EC.

Wait, no. Angle EAC is the angle at A between E and C, so it's the central angle over arc EC. So x = measure of arc EC.

To find arc EC, we need to know the total arcs.

Let me try to find the total arc from B to E to C.

But let's think about the whole circle: 360°.

We have arc DB = 85°, arc CD = 150°, arc BE = 90°.

But how do these arcs connect?

Let me try to visualize the circle with points B, D, C, E.

Arc DB is 85°, so from B to D is 85°.

Arc CD is 150°, so from C to D is 150°.

Arc BE is 90°, from B to E is 90°.

Let me try to express these arcs in terms of the circle.

Let me assume that the points are arranged in the order B, D, C, E around the circle. Let me see:

From B to D: 85°

From D to C: 150°

From C to E: ?

From E to B: 90°

Total: 85 + 150 + arc CE + 90 = 360.

So arc CE = 360 - (85 + 150 + 90) = 360 - 325 = 35°.

Therefore, arc CE is 35°, so x = 35°, which is option B.

Ah! This makes sense. So the answer is B. 35 degrees.

But how did I arrive at this? Let me verify.

By assuming the points are arranged in the order B, D, C, E. Then:

- Arc BD = 85° (given).
- Arc DC = 150° (given).
- Arc BE = 90° (since AE is perpendicular to AB, so arc BE is 90°).
- Then, arc CE is what remains.

But how does arc BE relate to the other arcs? Let me think. If the points are B, D, C, E, then the arc from B to E would go through D and C. So arc BE = arc BD + arc DC + arc CE? No, because arc BE is the direct arc from B to E, which might not pass through D and C. Wait, if the points are in order B, D, C, E, then the arc from B to E would go through D and C, so it would be arc BD + arc DC + arc CE? No, that would be the long way around. The short arc from B to E would be the other way, passing through C and D? No, it depends on the placement.

Actually, arc BE is 90°, which is the arc between B and E. If the points are arranged as B, D, C, E, then the arc from B to E could be either the short arc passing through D and C, or the long arc passing through the other side. But since arc BE is 90°, it must be the shorter arc.

But if arc BD is 85°, and arc DC is 150°, then the arc from B to C via D is 85 + 150 = 235°, which is longer than 180°, so the shorter arc from B to C would be 360 - 235 = 125°. But this complicates things.

However, if we consider that arc BE is 90°, and points are arranged such that arc BE is the direct arc, then we need to find how it connects to other arcs.

Let me try to draw this:

Start at B, go to D (arc BD = 85°), then from D to C (arc DC = 150°), then from C to E (arc CE = ?), and from E back to B (arc EB = 90°). 

But the total of these arcs would be 85 + 150 + arc CE + 90 = 360. So arc CE = 360 - 85 - 150 - 90 = 35°. So arc CE is 35°, hence x = 35°, which is option B.

Yes! This makes sense. So the key was to realize that the arc BE is 90°, and by adding up the known arcs, we can find arc CE, which corresponds to angle EAC.

Thus, the correct answer is B. 35°.
