MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to visualize the figure based on the given constraints. Let me jot down all the information provided:

- The length of line AD is 3 units.
- The length of line DB is 12 units.
- Length AC is y, CD is x, BC is z.
- Point D lies on line AB.
- Lines AD and CD are perpendicular.
- Lines AC and BC are also perpendicular.

So, first, since point D is on line AB, that suggests that points A, D, B are colinear, right? So AB is a straight line with D somewhere between A and B. Wait, but we know AD = 3 and DB = 12. Therefore, the total length of AB would be AD + DB = 3 + 12 = 15 units. So AB is 15 units long, with D dividing it into segments of 3 and 12.

Also, lines AD and CD are perpendicular. Since AD is part of AB, then CD is perpendicular to AB at point D. That means CD is like a vertical line (if AB is horizontal) going up from D. Similarly, lines AC and BC are perpendicular. Hmm, so AC is perpendicular to BC. That implies that triangle ABC has a right angle at point C. Because AC ⊥ BC, so angle C is 90 degrees. 

Wait, but point C is connected to D as well. So maybe there's a quadrilateral here? Or some triangles. Let me sketch mentally.

Let me think about coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates will help. Let's place point A at (0, 0). Then since AB is a straight line, let me set coordinate system such that AB is along the x-axis. So point A is at (0, 0), point B is at (15, 0), because AB is 15 units. Then point D is between A and B. Since AD = 3, D is at (3, 0).

Now, CD is perpendicular to AD. Since AD is along the x-axis from A(0,0) to D(3,0), direction is horizontal. Therefore, CD must be vertical. Because perpendicular to horizontal is vertical. So CD is vertical line through D(3,0). Therefore, point C has coordinates (3, k) for some k. Because CD is vertical, so x-coordinate same as D, which is 3. The length CD is x, so distance from D(3,0) to C(3,k) is |k - 0| = |k|. So x = |k|. Assuming upwards direction, k positive, so x = k.

But then, AC is the line from A(0,0) to C(3,k). And BC is the line from B(15,0) to C(3,k). Also, AC is perpendicular to BC. So their slopes multiply to -1.

Let me compute slopes. Slope of AC: (k - 0)/(3 - 0) = k/3. Slope of BC: (k - 0)/(3 - 15) = k / (-12) = -k/12. For them to be perpendicular, product of slopes should be -1. So:

(k/3) * (-k/12) = -1

Multiply left side: -k²/(36) = -1 → Multiply both sides by -1: k²/36 = 1 → k² = 36 → k = 6 or -6. Since we assumed upward direction, take k=6. So point C is at (3, 6). Therefore, coordinates:

A(0,0), D(3,0), B(15,0), C(3,6)

Now, need to find z, which is length of BC. Let's compute BC. Coordinates of B(15,0) and C(3,6). Distance formula:

√[(15 - 3)^2 + (0 - 6)^2] = √[12^2 + (-6)^2] = √[144 + 36] = √180. Simplify √180 = √(36*5) = 6√5. So z = 6√5. Which is option D.

Wait, but let me check again. Let me verify each step.

First, coordinates setup seems okay. AD is 3 units from (0,0) to (3,0). Correct. DB is from (3,0) to (15,0): difference is 12 units. Correct. CD is vertical from (3,0) to (3,6), so length is 6, so x = 6. Then AC is from (0,0) to (3,6): length is sqrt(3² + 6²)=sqrt(9+36)=sqrt(45)=3√5. But the question says AC is y, but we don't need that. However, BC is from (15,0) to (3,6): difference in x is 12, difference in y is 6. So squared terms 12² + 6² = 144 + 36 = 180. Square root is √180 = 6√5. Hence z is 6√5, which is option D.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming coordinates. Let me check the perpendicularity again. Slopes of AC and BC: slope AC is 6/3 = 2. Slope BC is (6 - 0)/(3 - 15) = 6/(-12) = -1/2. Multiplying 2 * (-1/2) = -1, which confirms they are perpendicular. Perfect. So that checks out.

Therefore, z is indeed 6√5. Looking at answer choices, D is 6√5. So answer is D.

Wait, but just to make sure, are there other possibilities? For example, could point C be below the x-axis? If k was negative, say -6, then coordinates of C would be (3,-6). Then AC would have slope (-6)/3 = -2, and BC slope would be (-6 - 0)/(3 - 15) = (-6)/(-12) = 1/2. Product is (-2)*(1/2) = -1, still perpendicular. Then BC length would be same, since distance is sqrt((15-3)^2 + (0 - (-6))^2) = sqrt(12² + 6²) same as before. So regardless of direction, z is same. So answer is D.

Hence, correct answer is D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ z $, we begin by interpreting the geometric constraints and using coordinate geometry to model the situation.

### Step 1: Coordinate Setup

We are told:

- $ AD = 3 $
- $ DB = 12 $
- $ AB $ is a straight line with point $ D $ lying on it.
- $ \overline{AD} \perp \overline{CD} $
- $ \overline{AC} \perp \overline{BC} $

Assign coordinates to simplify:

- Place point $ A $ at $ (0, 0) $
- Since $ AB = AD + DB = 3 + 12 = 15 $, place point $ B $ at $ (15, 0) $
- Thus, point $ D $, being 3 units from $ A $, lies at $ (3, 0) $

Because $ \overline{AD} \perp \overline{CD} $, and $ \overline{AD} $ is horizontal (along x-axis), the segment $ \overline{CD} $ must be **vertical**. So point $ C $ lies directly above or below $ D $, meaning its x-coordinate is 3.

Thus, point $ C $ can be written as $ (3, k) $, where $ k $ is the unknown height.

---

### Step 2: Use Perpendicularity Condition

Given that $ \overline{AC} \perp \overline{BC} $, the slopes of these two segments must satisfy:

$$
\text{slope of } \overline{AC} \cdot \text{slope of } \overline{BC} = -1
$$

Compute the slopes:

- Slope of $ \overline{AC} $: 
  $$
  m_{AC} = \frac{k - 0}{3 - 0} = \frac{k}{3}
  $$

- Slope of $ \overline{BC} $: 
  $$
  m_{BC} = \frac{k - 0}{3 - 15} = \frac{k}{-12}
  $$

Set the product equal to $ -1 $:

$$
\left(\frac{k}{3}\right)\left(\frac{k}{-12}\right) = -1
\Rightarrow \frac{-k^2}{36} = -1
\Rightarrow k^2 = 36
\Rightarrow k = 6 \quad (\text{since } k > 0)
$$

So, point $ C = (3, 6) $

---

### Step 3: Compute $ z = \text{length of } \overline{BC} $

Use the distance formula between $ B = (15, 0) $ and $ C = (3, 6) $:

$$
z = \sqrt{(15 - 3)^2 + (0 - 6)^2} = \sqrt{12^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{144 + 36} = \sqrt{180}
$$

Simplify:

$$
z = \sqrt{180} = \sqrt{36 \cdot 5} = 6\sqrt{5}
$$

\boxed{\text{D}}
