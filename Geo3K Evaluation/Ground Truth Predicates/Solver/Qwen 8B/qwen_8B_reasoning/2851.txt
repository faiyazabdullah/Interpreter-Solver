MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have angles at points A, B, and C. The problem gives us some angle measures and asks for the value of x. Let me parse the information again.

First, the given constraints are:

- Measure of Angle(A, C, B) is 52 degrees. Wait, angle notation can sometimes be confusing. In standard notation, Angle(A, C, B) would mean the angle at point C between points A and B. So that's angle ACB, right? Because the middle letter is the vertex. So angle at C between A and B. So ∠ACB = 52°.

Then, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B, A, C)), x). Similarly, Angle(B, A, C) is the angle at point A between points B and C. So that's angle BAC, which is ∠BAC = x.

Thirdly, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C, B, A)), 35). That would be the angle at point B between points C and A. So that's ∠CBA = 35°.

So putting it together, triangle ABC has angles at A, B, and C. Let me note down the known angles:

At point C (∠ACB): 52°
At point B (∠CBA): 35°
At point A (∠BAC): x (which we need to find)

Wait, but in a triangle, the sum of all interior angles is always 180 degrees. So if I can add up these three angles and set them equal to 180, then solve for x.

Let me check that approach. So ∠BAC + ∠ABC + ∠ACB = 180°

Substituting the known values:

x + 35° + 52° = 180°

Adding 35 and 52 first: 35 + 52 = 87. So,

x + 87° = 180°

Therefore, x = 180° - 87° = 93°

Hmm, so x is 93 degrees. Now looking at the answer choices:

A. 35
B. 52
C. 77
D. 93

So option D is 93. Therefore, the correct answer should be D.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the angles. Let me confirm the notation once more. 

Angle(A, C, B) is ∠ACB, yes. Then Angle(B, A, C) is ∠BAC. And Angle(C, B, A) is ∠CBA. So yes, those correspond to angles at C, A, and B respectively. So adding them up as per triangle angle sum makes sense. 

Alternatively, maybe there's something else here? Like maybe the triangle isn't a regular triangle? But no, regardless of the type of triangle, the sum of angles is always 180 degrees. So unless there's some other constraint or diagram that's missing, but the problem only gives these three angles. 

Another thought: could there be an exterior angle involved? For example, if one of these angles was an exterior angle? But the problem states the measure of each angle as given. The way they're written seems like they are the internal angles of the triangle. 

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the notation is different? For example, sometimes angle notation can be ambiguous, but I think in standard terms, the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(A, C, B) is indeed the angle at point C between points A and B. So that's correct.

Thus, my calculation seems valid. x is 93 degrees, which matches option D. Therefore, the answer should be D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we analyze the given geometric constraints involving the angles of triangle $ \triangle ABC $. The key relationships are:

- $ \angle ACB = 52^\circ $
- $ \angle CBA = 35^\circ $
- $ \angle BAC = x $

---

### Step 1: Use the Triangle Angle Sum Theorem

In any triangle, the sum of the interior angles equals $ 180^\circ $. Thus:

$$
\angle BAC + \angle ABC + \angle ACB = 180^\circ
$$

Substitute the known values into the equation:

$$
x + 35^\circ + 52^\circ = 180^\circ
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve for $ x $

Add $ 35^\circ + 52^\circ $:

$$
x + 87^\circ = 180^\circ
$$

Now isolate $ x $:

$$
x = 180^\circ - 87^\circ = 93^\circ
$$

---

### Final Answer

The value of $ x $ is $ 93^\circ $, which corresponds to **Option D**.

$$
\boxed{D}
$$

Final Answer: D
