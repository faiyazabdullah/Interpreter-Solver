MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two triangles, triangle BCD and triangle WXY, which are congruent. That means all corresponding sides and angles are equal. The question is asking for the value of x based on the given constraints.

First, let me list out all the given information:

1. Length of line CB is 11 units. So, BC = 11.
2. Measure of angle at point C (angle BCD) is given as 20x - 4 degrees.
3. Length of line WX is 2x + 5 units. So, WX = 2x + 5.
4. Measure of angle at point B (angle CBD) is 24x + 5 degrees. Wait, hold on, the notation might be important here. The measure of angle(C, B, D) would be angle at B between points C and D. So that's angle CBD. Similarly, angle(X, W, Y) is angle at W between X and Y, so angle XWY.

Also, since the triangles are congruent, their corresponding parts must be equal. But first, I need to figure out which parts correspond. Since it's triangle BCD ≅ triangle WXY, the order matters. So vertex B corresponds to W, C corresponds to X, and D corresponds to Y. Therefore:

- BC corresponds to WX
- CD corresponds to XY
- BD corresponds to WY
- Angles: angle at B (angle B) corresponds to angle at W (angle W), angle at C (angle C) corresponds to angle at X (angle X), and angle at D (angle D) corresponds to angle at Y (angle Y).

Wait, but the angles given are angle BCD (which is angle at C) and angle CBD (at B). Also, angle XWY is angle at W. Let me make sure about the correspondence.

Since triangle BCD ≅ triangle WXY, then:

- Vertex B corresponds to W
- Vertex C corresponds to X
- Vertex D corresponds to Y

Therefore, angle at B (angle B) in triangle BCD corresponds to angle at W in triangle WXY. Similarly, angle at C (angle C) corresponds to angle at X, and angle at D corresponds to angle at Y.

But looking at the given angles:

Measure of angle(B, C, D) is angle at C, which is angle BCD. So angle BCD in triangle BCD corresponds to angle at X in triangle WXY, which is angle WXY. Wait, no. Because triangle WXY has vertices W, X, Y. So angle at X would be angle WXY? Or wait, angle at X is formed by points W, X, Y. So angle at X is angle WXY?

Wait, maybe I should write down the correspondence properly.

If triangle BCD ≅ triangle WXY, then:

- Side BC corresponds to side WX
- Side CD corresponds to side XY
- Side BD corresponds to side WY

Angles:

- Angle at B (in BCD) corresponds to angle at W (in WXY)
- Angle at C (in BCD) corresponds to angle at X (in WXY)
- Angle at D (in BCD) corresponds to angle at Y (in WXY)

So, the given angle measures:

Angle BCD (at C) is 20x - 4 degrees. This should equal angle at X in triangle WXY, which is angle WXY. Wait, but the given angle measure for triangle WXY is angle(X, W, Y) which is angle at W, right? Wait, angle(X, W, Y) would be the angle at W, because the middle letter is the vertex. So angle XWY. So that's angle at W. 

Wait, the problem says:

MeasureOf(Angle(C, B, D)) = 20x -4. So that's angle at B, since the middle letter is B. So angle at B in triangle BCD is angle CBD. Wait, but earlier I thought angle BCD was angle at C. Let me clarify:

In angle notation, angle(B, C, D) is the angle at point C between points B and D. So that's angle BCD. So that's angle at C. Then, MeasureOf(Angle(C, B, D)) is angle at B? No, wait. Wait, angle(B, C, D) is the angle at C. Wait, no. The angle ABC is the angle at B. So angle(B, C, D) would be the angle at C between points B and D. So yes, angle BCD. So angle at C. 

Similarly, MeasureOf(Angle(C, B, D)) is angle at C. Wait, but the second given is MeasureOf(Angle(C, B, D))? Wait, no, original problem says:

Original given:

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B, C, D)), 20x-4)

Wait, that would be angle at C, since the middle letter is C. So angle BCD is 20x -4. Then, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C, B, D)), 24x +5). Wait, angle(C, B, D) would be angle at B, since the middle letter is B. So that's angle at B, between points C and D. Which is angle CBD. So angle CBD = 24x +5 degrees.

Then, MeasureOf(Angle(X, W, Y)) is 77 degrees. That's angle at W between points X and Y, so angle XWY = 77 degrees.

Now, since triangles BCD and WXY are congruent, their corresponding angles must be equal. Let me think about which angles correspond.

From triangle BCD ≅ triangle WXY, the correspondence is:

- angle at B (CBD) corresponds to angle at W (XWY)
- angle at C (BCD) corresponds to angle at X (WXY)
- angle at D (angle CDB?) corresponds to angle at Y (WYX?)

Wait, maybe I need to check the order again. If the triangles are BCD ≅ WXY, then the order of the letters determines the correspondence. So:

Vertex B corresponds to W,

Vertex C corresponds to X,

Vertex D corresponds to Y.

Thus, angle at B (angle B) in triangle BCD corresponds to angle at W in triangle WXY.

Angle at C (angle C) in triangle BCD corresponds to angle at X in triangle WXY.

Angle at D (angle D) in triangle BCD corresponds to angle at Y in triangle WXY.

So, angle CBD (which is angle at B in triangle BCD) corresponds to angle at W in triangle WXY, which is angle XWY. And angle BCD (at C in BCD) corresponds to angle at X in WXY, which is angle WXY. Also, angle at D in BCD (angle CDB) corresponds to angle at Y in WXY (angle WYX).

Given that, let's note the given angles:

Angle BCD (at C in BCD) is 20x -4 degrees. This corresponds to angle at X in WXY, which is angle WXY. However, the given angle for WXY is angle XWY, which is angle at W. Wait, perhaps there's confusion here. Let me re-examine.

The problem gives MeasureOf(Angle(X, W, Y)) = 77 degrees. As mentioned before, this is angle at W between X and Y, so angle XWY. So angle at W in triangle WXY is 77 degrees. Since triangles are congruent, angle at W in WXY corresponds to angle at B in BCD. Therefore, angle at B in BCD is also 77 degrees. Wait, but angle at B in BCD is angle CBD, which was given as 24x +5. Wait, earlier I had:

MeasureOf(Angle(C, B, D)) = 24x +5. Wait, angle(C, B, D) is angle at B, which is angle CBD. So angle CBD = 24x +5. But according to congruence, angle CBD equals angle at W in triangle WXY, which is angle XWY = 77 degrees. Therefore, setting them equal:

24x +5 = 77.

Let me check that. If angle CBD (from triangle BCD) corresponds to angle at W (from triangle WXY), which is 77 degrees. Therefore, 24x +5 = 77. Solving for x:

24x +5 = 77  
24x = 77 -5 = 72  
x = 72 / 24 = 3.

So x=3. Let me check if that makes sense. Let me verify with another angle to see if there are contradictions.

Alternatively, angle at C in triangle BCD is angle BCD = 20x -4. Since triangle BCD ≅ triangle WXY, angle at C corresponds to angle at X in triangle WXY. What is angle at X in triangle WXY? Well, in triangle WXY, the angles sum up to 180 degrees. We know angle at W is 77 degrees, and angle at X (corresponding to angle at C) is 20x -4. Also, angle at Y corresponds to angle at D in triangle BCD. Let's find that angle.

But maybe we can use the fact that in triangle BCD, the sum of angles is 180 degrees. Let's compute angles:

We have angle at B (CBD) = 24x +5, angle at C (BCD)=20x-4, and angle at D (angle CDB). Let me denote angle at D as something. Let's compute:

Sum of angles in triangle BCD: angle at B + angle at C + angle at D = 180.

So:

(24x +5) + (20x -4) + angle at D = 180  
Combine terms: 44x +1 + angle D = 180  
So angle D = 180 -44x -1 = 179 -44x degrees.

But since the triangles are congruent, angle at D in BCD corresponds to angle at Y in WXY. However, we don't have info about angle at Y directly. Alternatively, in triangle WXY, angles are:

At W: 77 degrees, at X: angle WXY (which corresponds to angle BCD = 20x -4), and at Y: angle WYX (which corresponds to angle at D in BCD, which is 179 -44x). Sum of these angles must be 180:

77 + (20x -4) + (179 -44x) = 180.

Let me compute that:

77 -4 + 179 = 77 + 175 = 252? Wait, 77 -4 is 73, plus 179 is 73 +179 = 252. Then, the terms with x: 20x -44x = -24x. So total equation:

252 -24x = 180  
Subtract 180 from both sides: 72 -24x = 0  
Which leads to 24x = 72 => x=3. Same result as before. So that confirms that x=3. So that seems consistent.

Another way: Let's check the length of sides. Given that BC = 11, which corresponds to WX. Since the triangles are congruent, BC = WX. So:

Length of BC is 11. Length of WX is 2x +5. So set them equal:

2x +5 = 11  
Solving: 2x = 6 => x=3. Again same result. 

So this gives x=3. Thus, regardless of whether we look at angles or sides, x=3. 

Looking at the answer choices, option B is 3. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

Wait, but just to make sure there isn't any mistake in the angle correspondence. For example, could there be another possible correspondence? Like maybe different order of letters? But the problem states triangle BCD ≅ triangle WXY. So the order is fixed. Hence, the correspondence is direct. So angle B corresponds to W, angle C to X, angle D to Y. Therefore, the steps above are correct.

Another check: Let's plug x=3 into all given expressions.

First, angle CBD = 24x +5 = 24*3 +5 = 72 +5 =77 degrees. Which matches angle at W (XWY) being 77 degrees. Good.

Angle BCD = 20x -4 = 20*3 -4 = 60 -4 = 56 degrees. So angle at X in triangle WXY is 56 degrees. Then, angle at Y in triangle WXY is 180 -77 -56 = 180 -133 = 47 degrees. In triangle BCD, angle at D is 179 -44x = 179 - 132 = 47 degrees. Correct.

Also, side BC is 11, and WX is 2x +5 = 2*3 +5 = 11. Correct. So all checks out. Therefore, x=3 is correct. Answer choice B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we start by analyzing the given geometric constraints involving the congruence of triangles $ \triangle BCD \cong \triangle WXY $. Congruent triangles imply that **all corresponding sides and angles are equal**. This allows us to equate known values across both triangles.

---

### Step 1: Use Correspondence of Angles

The congruence $ \triangle BCD \cong \triangle WXY $ implies the following angle correspondences:

- $ \angle B \leftrightarrow \angle W $
- $ \angle C \leftrightarrow \angle X $
- $ \angle D \leftrightarrow \angle Y $

From the given data:
- $ \angle CBD = 24x + 5 $ (this is angle at vertex $ B $)
- $ \angle XWY = 77^\circ $ (this is angle at vertex $ W $)

Since $ \angle CBD \leftrightarrow \angle XWY $, we equate:
$$
24x + 5 = 77
$$
Solving:
$$
24x = 72 \Rightarrow x = 3
$$

---

### Step 2: Verify Consistency with Other Constraints

Let’s confirm this value using another piece of information.

#### Check Triangle Angle Sum
In triangle $ \triangle BCD $, the angles are:
- $ \angle B = 24x + 5 $
- $ \angle C = 20x - 4 $
- $ \angle D = ? $

Using the triangle angle sum property:
$$
\angle B + \angle C + \angle D = 180^\circ
$$
Plug in known values:
$$
(24x + 5) + (20x - 4) + \text{Angle } D = 180
$$
$$
44x + 1 + \text{Angle } D = 180
\Rightarrow \text{Angle } D = 179 - 44x
$$

Now check triangle $ \triangle WXY $, where:
- $ \angle W = 77^\circ $
- $ \angle X = 20x - 4 $ (corresponds to $ \angle C $)
- $ \angle Y = 179 - 44x $ (corresponds to $ \angle D $)

Use angle sum:
$$
\angle W + \angle X + \angle Y = 180
\Rightarrow 77 + (20x - 4) + (179 - 44x) = 180
$$
Simplify:
$$
77 - 4 + 179 - 24x = 180
\Rightarrow 252 - 24x = 180
\Rightarrow 24x = 72 \Rightarrow x = 3
$$

This confirms consistency.

---

### Step 3: Confirm Using Side Lengths

Given:
- $ \text{Length of } BC = 11 $
- $ \text{Length of } WX = 2x + 5 $

Since $ \triangle BCD \cong \triangle WXY $, $ BC \leftrightarrow WX $, so:
$$
2x + 5 = 11
\Rightarrow 2x = 6 \Rightarrow x = 3
$$

Again, consistent with our previous results.

---

### Final Conclusion

All derived equations consistently yield $ x = 3 $, confirming its correctness. Among the answer choices, **Option B** matches this value.

**Final Answer: B**
