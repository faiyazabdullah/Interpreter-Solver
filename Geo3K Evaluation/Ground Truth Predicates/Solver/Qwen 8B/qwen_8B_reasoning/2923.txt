MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, and C. The problem says that the length of line BC is 5 units, the length of line AC is 2 units, and the length of line AB is x, which we need to find. Also, it mentions that lines AC and AB are perpendicular. 

First, I should probably visualize this. Let me sketch a rough diagram in my mind. Since AC and AB are perpendicular, they form a right angle at point A. So, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at A. Wait, but hold on—AC and AB are the legs, and BC would be the hypotenuse? But wait, the length of BC is given as 5, and AC is 2. If it's a right triangle at A, then by Pythagoras theorem, the square of BC (the hypotenuse) should equal the sum of squares of AB and AC. 

Let me write down the formula. In a right-angled triangle, hypotenuse squared equals sum of squares of the other two sides. Here, BC is the hypotenuse because it connects points B and C, which are connected through A. So:

BC² = AB² + AC²

We know BC is 5, so 5² = x² + 2². Therefore:

25 = x² + 4

Subtracting 4 from both sides gives x² = 21. Taking the square root, x = √21. 

Wait, but looking at the answer choices, option C is √21. So that would make sense. But let me double-check if I got the right angle correctly. The problem states that Line(A,C) and Line(A,B) are perpendicular. That means the angle between them is 90 degrees, so yes, the right angle is at A. Hence, BC is indeed the hypotenuse. 

But just to make sure there isn't a misunderstanding. Suppose someone thought that maybe AC is the hypotenuse? But no, because AC is one of the legs. Because the right angle is at A, so AC and AB are the legs. So BC has to be the hypotenuse. Therefore, the calculation holds. 

So solving for x, we get sqrt(21). Which is option C. Therefore, the answer should be C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration described in the problem:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Configuration**

We are told:

- $ \text{Length}(AB) = x $
- $ \text{Length}(AC) = 2 $
- $ \text{Length}(BC) = 5 $
- Lines $ AB $ and $ AC $ are **perpendicular**.

This implies that triangle $ ABC $ is a **right triangle**, with the right angle at vertex $ A $. Thus, sides $ AB $ and $ AC $ are the legs of the triangle, and side $ BC $ is the **hypotenuse**.

---

### **Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**

In a right triangle, the relationship among the sides is given by the **Pythagorean Theorem**:

$$
\text{(Hypotenuse)}^2 = \text{(Leg 1)}^2 + \text{(Leg 2)}^2
$$

Here, $ BC $ is the hypotenuse, and $ AB $ and $ AC $ are the legs. Substituting known values:

$$
BC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2
$$

$$
5^2 = x^2 + 2^2
$$

$$
25 = x^2 + 4
$$

---

### **Step 3: Solve for $ x $**

$$
x^2 = 25 - 4 = 21
$$

$$
x = \sqrt{21}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Match with Given Options**

The computed value $ x = \sqrt{21} $ matches **Option C**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\text{C}}
$$

Final Answer: C
