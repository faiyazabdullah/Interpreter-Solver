MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have two similar triangles, triangle WXZ and STR. Wait, actually, the question says triangle WXZ is similar to triangle SRT. Let me make sure I get that right. The notation can sometimes be confusing. 

First, let me note down the given information:

- The length of line TS is 6. Since TS is part of triangle SRT, that would mean side RT? Or maybe ST? Wait, triangles are usually labeled with vertices, so triangle SRT has sides SR, RT, and TS. So ST is one of its sides. Given that LengthOf(Line(T, S)) is 6, which is ST = 6. Also, LengthOf(Line(W, X)) is 5, so that's WX = 5. 

Then, the problem states that triangle WXZ is similar to triangle SRT. So, similarity ratio between them should be important here. Also, the perimeter of triangle SRT is 15. We need to find the perimeter of triangle WXZ.

Wait, but first, let's confirm the correspondence of the similar triangles. When they say triangle WXZ ~ triangle SRT, the order of the letters matters. That means angle W corresponds to angle S, angle X corresponds to angle R, and angle Z corresponds to angle T. Therefore, the sides opposite these angles should be proportional. 

So, in triangle SRT, the sides are SR, RT, and TS. In triangle WXZ, the corresponding sides would be WX, XZ, and ZW. Wait, no, because the order is WXZ ~ SRT. So vertex W corresponds to S, X corresponds to R, Z corresponds to T. Therefore, side WX in triangle WXZ corresponds to side SR in triangle SRT. Then side XZ corresponds to RT, and side ZW corresponds to TS. 

But wait, the problem mentions that ST = 6. In triangle SRT, ST is one of the sides. Let me sketch mentally. Triangle SRT: points S, R, T. So ST is a side connecting S and T. Similarly, in triangle WXZ, the corresponding side would be... since W corresponds to S, X corresponds to R, Z corresponds to T. So the side opposite W (which is XZ) corresponds to the side opposite S in triangle SRT. Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the sides directly. 

In similar triangles, corresponding sides are in proportion. So, for example, side WX (in triangle WXZ) corresponds to side SR (in triangle SRT). Side XZ corresponds to RT, and side ZW corresponds to TS. But the problem gives us that ST = 6. Wait, ST is the same as TS, so that's the side between T and S, which in triangle SRT is the side opposite R? Hmm, maybe I need to clarify the sides.

Alternatively, maybe using ratios based on the given lengths. They tell us that WX = 5 and ST = 6. Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of their corresponding sides is equal. So the ratio of WX to ST would be the scale factor from triangle SRT to triangle WXZ. 

Let me write that down. If triangle WXZ ~ triangle SRT, then the ratio of their corresponding sides is constant. Let's denote the ratio as k. So, for example, WX / SR = XZ / RT = ZW / TS = k. However, we know that WX = 5 and ST = 6. Wait, but ST is a side of triangle SRT. Which side does ST correspond to in triangle WXZ?

Since the similarity is WXZ ~ SRT, the correspondence is W→S, X→R, Z→T. Therefore, side WX in triangle WXZ corresponds to side SR in triangle SRT. Then, side XZ corresponds to RT, and side ZW corresponds to TS. 

Therefore, the ratio of similarity is WX / SR = XZ / RT = ZW / TS. But we don't know SR, RT, or TS? Wait, but TS is given as 6. Wait, hold on. The problem says that ST = 6, which is the same as TS. So TS is a side of triangle SRT. Since triangle SRT has perimeter 15, and one of its sides is TS = 6, we can find the sum of the other two sides. 

Let me calculate that. Let’s call the sides of triangle SRT as follows: let’s denote SR = a, RT = b, and TS = c. Given that c = 6, and the perimeter is a + b + c = 15. So a + b + 6 = 15 → a + b = 9. 

Now, since triangle WXZ ~ triangle SRT, the ratio of their perimeters is equal to the ratio of their corresponding sides. The perimeter of triangle SRT is 15, and we need the perimeter of triangle WXZ. Let’s denote the ratio of similarity as k. So, the perimeter of WXZ would be k * 15. 

But how do we find k? Well, we know that one pair of corresponding sides is WX and TS. Because in triangle WXZ, side WX corresponds to side TS in triangle SRT. Wait, earlier I thought that WX corresponds to SR, but maybe I made a mistake there. Let me re-examine the correspondence. 

If triangle WXZ ~ triangle SRT, then the order of the vertices is important. The first letter of each triangle corresponds. So W corresponds to S, X corresponds to R, Z corresponds to T. Therefore, side WX in triangle WXZ corresponds to side SR in triangle SRT. Then, side XZ corresponds to RT, and side ZW corresponds to TS. 

Wait, so the side WX (of triangle WXZ) corresponds to SR (of triangle SRT), and the side ZW (of triangle WXZ) corresponds to TS (of triangle SRT). So, if we can find the ratio between corresponding sides, like WX/SR or ZW/TS, etc. 

However, we are given that WX = 5 and TS = 6. So, if we can find which sides those correspond to. For instance, if we take the ratio of WX to the corresponding side in SRT. But which side is that? Since WX corresponds to SR, but we don't know SR. Alternatively, if we consider another pair of sides. Wait, but we also know that the perimeter of SRT is 15, and TS is 6. Maybe we need more information. 

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio can be determined by considering the known side lengths. Suppose that the ratio of similarity is k. Then, since triangle WXZ ~ triangle SRT, then:

WX corresponds to SR, so k = WX / SR

XZ corresponds to RT, so k = XZ / RT

ZW corresponds to TS, so k = ZW / TS

But we know that TS = 6, and ZW is a side of triangle WXZ. But we don't know ZW yet. However, we might be able to relate the perimeters. 

The perimeter of triangle SRT is 15, which equals SR + RT + TS = a + b + 6 = 15, so a + b = 9. 

The perimeter of triangle WXZ is WX + XZ + ZW = 5 + XZ + ZW. 

But since the triangles are similar, the ratio of perimeters is equal to the ratio of corresponding sides. Let’s denote the ratio as k. So, perimeter of WXZ / perimeter of SRT = k. Therefore, perimeter of WXZ = k * 15. 

Also, since k = WX / SR = 5 / SR. But SR is a side of triangle SRT. However, without knowing SR, this seems tricky. But maybe we can express everything in terms of k. 

Alternatively, since we have the perimeter of SRT as 15, and one of its sides is TS=6. Let me think. If we can find the ratio k, then we can compute the perimeter. How?

We can use the fact that the ratio k is equal to the ratio of any corresponding sides. For example, if we can find a corresponding side. Let's see: suppose that in triangle SRT, the sides are SR, RT, and TS = 6. Then, the perimeter is SR + RT + 6 = 15 ⇒ SR + RT = 9. 

If triangle WXZ ~ triangle SRT, then the sides of WXZ are k*SR, k*RT, and k*TS. Therefore, the perimeter of WXZ is k*(SR + RT + TS) = k*15. But we also know that one of the sides of WXZ is WX = 5. Which side does that correspond to? 

Earlier confusion arises here. Let me clarify again. Since triangle WXZ ~ triangle SRT, with correspondence W→S, X→R, Z→T. Therefore, side WX of triangle WXZ corresponds to side SR of triangle SRT. Therefore, WX = k * SR. Similarly, side XZ corresponds to RT, so XZ = k * RT. And side ZW corresponds to TS, so ZW = k * TS. 

Therefore, the perimeter of triangle WXZ is k*(SR + RT + TS) = k*15. 

But we also have that the side WX = 5, which is equal to k*SR. Also, the side ZW corresponds to TS, which is 6, so ZW = k*TS = k*6. 

But we don't know ZW. However, we can express SR in terms of k. From WX = k*SR ⇒ SR = WX/k = 5/k. Similarly, since SR + RT = 9, and RT = ?

Wait, RT is a side of triangle SRT. Since triangle SRT has sides SR, RT, TS, with SR + RT = 9. Also, the perimeter is 15. Now, if we could find the value of k, then we could find the perimeter of WXZ. 

But how? Let's think. Since ZW corresponds to TS. ZW = k * TS = k*6. Also, ZW is a side of triangle WXZ. However, we don't know ZW. But maybe we can relate it through the perimeter. 

The perimeter of triangle WXZ is 5 + XZ + ZW. But XZ = k*RT, and ZW = k*6. Also, since SR + RT = 9, and SR = 5/k. Therefore, RT = 9 - SR = 9 - 5/k. 

Thus, XZ = k * RT = k*(9 - 5/k) = 9k - 5. 

Similarly, ZW = 6k. 

So, the perimeter of triangle WXZ is 5 + (9k - 5) + 6k = 5 + 9k -5 +6k = 15k. 

Which matches the earlier conclusion that the perimeter is k*15. 

But how do we find k? 

Well, we have another equation involving k. Let me check. Are there any other sides we can relate? 

Wait, in triangle SRT, the sides are SR = 5/k, RT = 9 - 5/k, and TS = 6. 

But in triangle SRT, the sides must satisfy the triangle inequality. However, maybe that's not helpful here. 

Alternatively, perhaps we can find k using another relation. Wait, but we only have one equation here. Unless there's something else. 

Wait, but perhaps we can use the fact that the sides of triangle SRT must satisfy the triangle inequalities. But maybe that's too vague. 

Wait, maybe there's another way. Let me recall that the perimeter of triangle WXZ is 15k. But we need to find this perimeter. However, we don't know k. 

But maybe we can find k using the given information. Let me think. 

Wait, we know that in triangle SRT, the sides are SR = 5/k, RT = 9 - 5/k, and TS = 6. These three sides must form a valid triangle. Therefore, they must satisfy the triangle inequalities. 

For example, SR + RT > TS: 

SR + RT = (5/k) + (9 - 5/k) ) = 9. So 9 > TS = 6. Which holds. 

Another inequality: SR + TS > RT. 

SR + TS = (5/k) + 6 > RT = 9 - 5/k 

So (5/k) + 6 > 9 - 5/k 

Multiply both sides by k (assuming k positive):

5 + 6k > 9k - 5 

Bring all terms to left:

5 + 6k -9k +5 >0 

(5+5) -3k >0 

10 -3k>0 → 3k <10 → k<10/3 ≈3.333...

Third inequality: RT + TS > SR 

RT + TS = (9 - 5/k) + 6 = 15 - 5/k > SR =5/k 

So 15 -5/k >5/k → 15 > 10/k → 15k >10 → k>10/15=2/3≈0.666...

So k must be between 2/3 and 10/3. Not sure if that helps. 

But still, we need another equation to find k. Wait, perhaps I missed something. 

Wait, the problem says that triangle WXZ ~ triangle SRT, and we have WX =5, which is a side of triangle WXZ, corresponding to SR in triangle SRT. But we don't have any direct info about other sides except TS=6. 

Wait, but maybe the ratio k can be found via another side. For example, if we can find another corresponding side. However, we don't have any other given side lengths. 

Wait, unless there's something wrong in my assumption. Let me go back. 

Maybe I got the correspondence wrong. Perhaps the correspondence is different. Let me double-check. 

When you have triangle ABC ~ triangle DEF, then AB corresponds to DE, BC to EF, and AC to DF. So the order of the letters determines the correspondence. 

So, in our case, triangle WXZ ~ triangle SRT. So W corresponds to S, X to R, Z to T. Therefore, side WX corresponds to side SR, side XZ corresponds to side RT, and side WZ corresponds to side ST. 

Therefore, side WZ corresponds to ST. So WZ / ST = k. 

Given that, WZ = k * ST = k * 6. 

Also, the perimeter of triangle WXZ is WX + XZ + WZ = 5 + XZ + 6k. 

But XZ corresponds to RT, so XZ = k * RT. 

And in triangle SRT, the sides are SR, RT, ST =6. Their sum is 15. So SR + RT + 6 =15 ⇒ SR + RT =9. 

But SR corresponds to WX, which is 5. So SR = 5/k. 

Therefore, RT = 9 - SR = 9 - 5/k. 

Hence, XZ = k * RT = k*(9 - 5/k) =9k -5. 

So perimeter of WXZ is 5 + (9k -5) + 6k = 5 +9k -5 +6k =15k. 

So the perimeter of WXZ is 15k. 

But how do we find k? 

Ah! Wait, we can use the fact that in triangle SRT, the sides are SR =5/k, RT=9 -5/k, and ST=6. These must satisfy the triangle inequality. However, we don't have specific values. 

But maybe there's another approach. Let me think. 

Alternatively, since the perimeter of triangle SRT is 15, and we have that perimeter of triangle WXZ is 15k. But we need to find k. 

Is there a way to find k using another relationship? 

Wait, perhaps using the fact that in triangle SRT, the sides are SR, RT, ST. We know ST=6. Also, SR + RT =9. 

Moreover, in triangle SRT, the ratio between the sides can be expressed in terms of k. 

But I'm stuck here. 

Wait, perhaps we can assume that the triangles are similar, so their sides are proportional. So, the ratio between the sides can be determined by comparing known sides. 

But we only know one side of triangle SRT (ST=6) and one side of triangle WXZ (WX=5). But which sides correspond? 

If WX corresponds to SR, then the ratio is 5/SR. But we don't know SR. 

Alternatively, if we consider that WZ corresponds to ST. So WZ / ST = k. But we don't know WZ. 

Wait, but maybe we can use the perimeter of triangle WXZ. Since we have perimeter =15k, but we don't know k. However, we can find k if we can find another equation. 

Wait, but if we can find another expression for k. Let me think. 

Suppose we look at the side RT in triangle SRT. RT =9 - SR =9 -5/k. 

Also, in triangle SRT, the sides are SR, RT, ST=6. So, using the Law of Cosines or something? No, we don't have angles. 

Alternatively, maybe the triangles being similar implies that the ratios of the sides are consistent. 

Wait, for example, the ratio between SR and RT in triangle SRT is (5/k)/(9 -5/k). And in triangle WXZ, the ratio between WX and XZ is 5/(9k -5). Since the triangles are similar, these ratios should be equal. Wait, no. The ratios of corresponding sides are equal. 

Wait, the ratio of SR to RT in triangle SRT should be equal to the ratio of WX to XZ in triangle WXZ. Because they are corresponding sides. 

Wait, in triangle SRT, sides are SR, RT, ST. In triangle WXZ, corresponding sides are WX, XZ, WZ. So, the ratio of SR to RT should equal the ratio of WX to XZ. 

So, SR / RT = WX / XZ. 

From before, SR =5/k, RT=9 -5/k, WX=5, XZ=9k -5. 

So substituting:

(5/k) / (9 -5/k) = 5 / (9k -5)

Cross-multiplying:

(5/k)*(9k -5) = 5*(9 -5/k)

Simplify left side: 5*(9k -5)/k = 5*(9 -5/k)

Right side: 5*(9 -5/k)

So both sides are equal. Hence, this equality holds for any k. Which means that this doesn't give us new information. So this approach isn't helping. 

Hmm, so this suggests that we need another way. Maybe I need to use the fact that in triangle SRT, the sides are SR, RT, and ST=6, and the perimeter is 15. So SR + RT =9. 

Additionally, in triangle SRT, the sides must satisfy the triangle inequality. So, for example, SR + RT > ST → 9 >6, which holds. Also, SR + ST > RT → SR +6 > RT. Since RT =9 - SR, then SR +6 >9 - SR → 2SR >3 → SR>1.5. Similarly, RT + ST > SR → RT +6 > SR. Since RT =9 - SR, then 9 - SR +6 > SR → 15 - SR > SR → 15 > 2SR → SR <7.5. 

So SR is between 1.5 and 7.5. 

But how does this help? 

Alternatively, maybe the key lies in recognizing that since the ratio k is the same for all corresponding sides, and we have expressions for the sides. 

But without additional information, it seems impossible. Wait, but maybe we can find k using the perimeter of triangle WXZ. 

Wait, the perimeter of triangle WXZ is 15k, and we need to find this. However, we don't know k. But maybe there is a unique solution? Or perhaps there's missing information? 

Wait, but the problem gives that triangle WXZ ~ triangle SRT, and provides WX=5 and ST=6, and the perimeter of SRT is 15. Is there something I'm missing here? 

Wait, perhaps I need to realize that the ratio k is equal to the ratio of WX to the corresponding side in SRT. But which side is that? Earlier, I assumed that WX corresponds to SR, but what if it corresponds to another side? 

Wait, maybe the correspondence is different. Let me check again. 

The similarity statement is triangle WXZ ~ triangle SRT. So, the order of the letters is important. This means that angle W corresponds to angle S, angle X to angle R, angle Z to angle T. 

Therefore, the sides opposite these angles are proportional. 

In triangle SRT, the side opposite angle S is RT. In triangle WXZ, the side opposite angle W is XZ. So, XZ corresponds to RT. 

Similarly, the side opposite angle R in triangle SRT is ST. In triangle WXZ, the side opposite angle X is WZ. Therefore, WZ corresponds to ST. 

And the side opposite angle T in triangle SRT is SR. In triangle WXZ, the side opposite angle Z is WX. So, WX corresponds to SR. 

Therefore, the ratio k is equal to the ratio of corresponding sides: 

WX / SR = XZ / RT = WZ / ST = k. 

We know that WX =5 and ST=6. So, if we can find either SR or WZ, we can find k. 

But we don't know SR or WZ. However, we can express them in terms of k. 

As before, SR = WX / k = 5/k. 

Also, WZ = k * ST = 6k. 

Also, the perimeter of triangle SRT is SR + RT + ST = 15. 

We know ST =6, so SR + RT =9. 

But RT is the side opposite angle R in triangle SRT, which corresponds to XZ in triangle WXZ. And XZ = k * RT. 

But we also know that perimeter of triangle WXZ is 15k, which is equal to WX + XZ + WZ =5 + XZ +6k. 

But XZ = k * RT. And RT =9 - SR =9 -5/k. 

Therefore, XZ =k*(9 -5/k)=9k -5. 

So perimeter of WXZ is 5 + (9k -5) +6k =15k. 

This brings us back to the same equation. 

But how to find k? 

Wait, perhaps there's another relationship. Since in triangle SRT, we have sides SR, RT, ST=6. And in triangle WXZ, we have sides 5, 9k -5, and 6k. 

But these triangles are similar, so their sides must be proportional. So the ratios between the sides must be consistent. 

For example, the ratio between SR and RT in triangle SRT should be the same as the ratio between WX and XZ in triangle WXZ. 

So, SR / RT = WX / XZ. 

Substituting:

(SR) / RT = (5) / (9k -5). 

But SR =5/k and RT =9 -5/k. 

So:

(5/k) / (9 -5/k) = 5 / (9k -5)

Let me compute the left side:

(5/k) divided by (9 -5/k) = [5/k] / [(9k -5)/k] = 5/k * k/(9k -5) = 5/(9k -5). 

Which is equal to the right side. So this doesn't give us new information. 

So this shows that the equation is satisfied for any k. Thus, we cannot determine k from this. 

Hmm, this suggests that there is insufficient information? But the problem must have a solution. So I must have missed something. 

Wait, let's think differently. Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of their perimeters is equal to the ratio of any corresponding sides. 

So, perimeter of WXZ / perimeter of SRT = WX / SR = 5 / SR. 

But perimeter of SRT is 15, so perimeter of WXZ = (5/SR)*15. 

But we also know that perimeter of WXZ =15k, and k =5/SR. So this is consistent. 

But we still don't know SR. 

Wait, but SR is a side of triangle SRT, which has perimeter 15. So SR + RT + 6 =15 → SR + RT =9. 

But we need to find SR. 

Is there a way to find SR? 

Wait, but unless there's more information. Wait, but maybe the fact that the triangles are similar allows us to find ratios between sides. 

Let me think. Let's denote the sides of triangle SRT as a=SR, b=RT, c=ST=6. So a + b +6=15 → a +b=9. 

Triangle WXZ has sides corresponding to a, b, c scaled by k. So its sides are ka, kb, kc. 

But we know one of its sides is 5. Which side is that? It depends on the correspondence. 

Earlier, we said that side WX corresponds to SR=a. So WX =ka =5. So k=5/a. 

Also, the perimeter of WXZ is ka + kb + kc =k(a +b +c)=k*15. 

But we want to find this perimeter. 

So perimeter of WXZ =k*15 = (5/a)*15 =75/a. 

But we need to find a. 

But we have a +b=9, and in triangle SRT, the sides are a, b, 6. 

But we need more info. 

Unless we can find another relation. 

Wait, but since the triangles are similar, the ratios of the sides must be consistent. So for example, a/b = (corresponding sides in WXZ). 

But we don't know which sides correspond. Wait, in triangle SRT, the sides are a, b, 6. In triangle WXZ, the sides are 5, kb, kc. 

Wait, if the correspondence is such that a corresponds to the side of length 5 in WXZ. 

Wait, if WX corresponds to a, then the other sides are XZ corresponds to b, and WZ corresponds to c=6. 

So, the sides of WXZ are 5, kb, kc. 

But we also know that the perimeter of WXZ is 5 + kb + kc =5 +k(b +c). 

But since in triangle SRT, a +b +c =15, and c=6, so a +b =9. 

So perimeter of WXZ =5 +k(b +c) =5 +k(b +6). 

But also, perimeter of WX Z is k*15. 

So equate these two expressions: 

k*15 =5 +k(b +6) 

Expand: 15k =5 +kb +6k 

Subtract 6k from both sides: 9k =5 +kb 

Factor out k: k(9 -b) =5 

But from triangle SRT, a +b =9 → a =9 -b. 

So k*a =5 → k =5/a. 

But a =9 -b, so k =5/(9 -b). 

But from above, k(9 -b) =5 → k =5/(9 -b), which is consistent. 

Still no progress. 

Wait, but we also know that in triangle SRT, the sides are a, b, 6, and they must satisfy the triangle inequalities. 

So, for example, a +b >6 → 9 >6, which holds. 

a +6 >b → a +6 >b → since a =9 -b, substitute: (9 -b) +6 >b → 15 -b >b → 15 >2b → b <7.5 

Similarly, b +6 >a → b +6 >9 -b → 2b >3 → b >1.5 

So b ∈ (1.5, 7.5). 

But how does this help us? 

We need to find the perimeter of WXZ, which is 15k. 

But k =5/a, and a =9 -b. 

But we don't know b. 

Wait, unless there's a way to express the perimeter in terms of b. 

Perimeter of WXZ is 15k =15*(5/a) =75/a. 

But a =9 -b. 

But since a +b=9, and a =9 -b, we can't determine a unique value for a. 

This suggests that the problem as stated may have multiple solutions, depending on the specific values of a and b. But the answer choices suggest that there is a unique answer. 

Wait, but this indicates a contradiction. There must be something wrong in my reasoning. 

Wait, going back to the problem statement: 

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS: Equals(LengthOf(Line(T, S)), 6) Equals(LengthOf(Line(W, X)), 5)" 

Wait, the problem says that Line(T, S) has length 6, which is ST =6. And Line(W,X) has length 5, which is WX=5. 

Then the question is to find the perimeter of triangle WXZ, given that triangle WXZ ~ triangle SRT, ST=6, WX=5, and perimeter of SRT is 15. 

Wait, perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the correspondence of the similar triangles. Maybe the correspondence is different. Let me recheck. 

The problem says: "triangle WXZ ~ triangle SRT". So the order is W→S, X→R, Z→T. 

Therefore, side WX corresponds to side SR, side XZ corresponds to side RT, and side WZ corresponds to side ST. 

So, the ratio of similarity is WX / SR = XZ / RT = WZ / ST. 

We know WX=5, ST=6. So, let's denote the ratio as k = WX / SR = WZ / ST. 

So, k = 5 / SR = WZ / 6 → WZ =6k. 

Also, since the perimeter of SRT is 15, and its sides are SR, RT, and ST=6. 

Perimeter of SRT: SR + RT + 6 =15 → SR + RT =9. 

Let me denote SR = x, RT = y. So x + y =9. 

Also, from similarity, XZ / RT = k → XZ = k*y. 

Also, perimeter of WXZ is WX + XZ + WZ =5 + ky +6k. 

But since the triangles are similar, the ratio of perimeters is k. So perimeter of WXZ =k * perimeter of SRT =k*15. 

So, 5 + ky +6k =15k → 5 +ky =9k → ky =9k -5. 

But y =9 -x, since x + y =9. 

So, k*(9 -x) =9k -5 → 9k -kx =9k -5 → -kx = -5 → kx =5. 

But x = SR, and k =5/x. 

So this gives us k =5/x, and from kx=5, this is consistent. 

But how does this help us? 

We need to find the perimeter of WXZ, which is 15k. 

But k =5/x, and x + y =9. 

But we need to find x. 

Wait, but x is SR, which is a side of triangle SRT. 

But we don't have enough info to determine x. 

But wait, in triangle SRT, the sides are x, y, 6, with x + y =9. Also, the triangle must satisfy the triangle inequality. 

But unless there is another condition. 

Wait, but if we use the fact that the sides of triangle SRT are x, y, 6, and the sides of triangle WXZ are 5, ky, 6k. 

But since the triangles are similar, the ratios between their sides must be consistent. 

So, the ratio between x and y in triangle SRT should be the same as the ratio between the corresponding sides in triangle WXZ. 

In triangle SRT, the sides are x, y, 6. 

In triangle WXZ, the corresponding sides are 5, ky, 6k. 

So, the ratio between x and y should equal the ratio between 5 and ky. 

So, x/y =5/(ky). 

But from earlier, y =9 -x, and k =5/x. 

Substitute k into the equation: 

x/y =5/( (5/x)*y ) =5 / (5y/x) =x/y. 

Again, this leads to an identity, giving no new information. 

It appears that the problem is underdetermined, which contradicts the existence of answer choices. This suggests that there might be a mistake in my understanding of the problem. 

Wait, let me read the problem again carefully. 

The problem says: 

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS:
Equals(LengthOf(Line(T, S)), 6)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(W, X)), 5)

QUESTION:
Find the perimeter of △WXZ, if △WXZ ∼ △SRT, ST = 6, WX = 5, and the perimeter of △SRT = 15."

Wait, the problem says ST =6, which is the same as TS. Also, WX =5. 

But in the given constraints, it says "LengthOf(Line(T, S)) =6", which is ST=6. And "LengthOf(Line(W, X)) =5", which is WX=5. 

So, the problem gives us that in triangle SRT, one of its sides is ST=6, and in triangle WXZ, one of its sides is WX=5. 

Now, since the triangles are similar, the ratio of similarity is 5/6, because WX corresponds to ST? Wait, but earlier analysis suggested otherwise. 

Wait, if the triangles are similar, and if WX corresponds to ST, then the ratio would be 5/6. But why would WX correspond to ST? 

This depends on the correspondence of the triangles. If △WXZ ~ △SRT, then the correspondence is W→S, X→R, Z→T. So, side WX corresponds to SR, not to ST. 

But if the correspondence were different, like W→S, X→T, Z→R, then WX would correspond to ST. But that would change the correspondence. 

Wait, maybe the correspondence is different. Perhaps the problem uses a different ordering. Let me think: when two triangles are similar, the order of the vertices determines the correspondence. 

If △WXZ ~ △SRT, then the correspondence is W→S, X→R, Z→T. So, the sides are: 

WX corresponds to SR, XZ corresponds to RT, and WZ corresponds to ST. 

But if instead, the correspondence was W→S, X→T, Z→R, then WX would correspond to ST. 

But how can we know? The standard convention is that the order of the vertices defines the correspondence. So, △ABC ~ △DEF means AB corresponds to DE, BC to EF, CA to FD. 

Therefore, in △WXZ ~ △SRT, it must be that W corresponds to S, X to R, Z to T. 

Thus, side WX corresponds to SR, XZ corresponds to RT, and WZ corresponds to ST. 

So, the ratio of similarity is WX / SR = XZ / RT = WZ / ST. 

Given that, and knowing that ST=6, WZ = k * ST =6k. 

But we also know that perimeter of SRT is 15, and ST=6. So, the other sides are SR and RT, which add up to 9. 

But how to find k? 

Wait, if we assume that the side WX corresponds to ST, then the ratio would be 5/6, leading to perimeter of WXZ being (5/6)*15 =12.5, which is option A. 

But this assumes that WX corresponds to ST, which would require a different correspondence of the triangles. 

Maybe the problem has a typo or I misread the correspondence. 

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended the correspondence to be such that WX corresponds to ST. Let's explore this possibility. 

Assume that △WXZ ~ △SRT with correspondence W→S, X→T, Z→R. This would mean that side WX corresponds to ST. 

In this case, the ratio k = WX / ST =5/6. 

Then, the perimeter of △WXZ would be k * perimeter of △SRT = (5/6)*15 =12.5, which is option A. 

This matches one of the answer choices. 

But why would the correspondence be W→S, X→T, Z→R? This would imply that angle W corresponds to angle S, angle X corresponds to angle T, and angle Z corresponds to angle R. 

But this would mean that the order of the vertices in the similarity is W→S, X→T, Z→R, which would make △WXZ ~ △STR, not △SRT. 

Wait, the problem states △WXZ ~ △SRT. So, the correct correspondence would be W→S, X→R, Z→T. 

But if the problem had said △WXZ ~ △STR, then the correspondence would be W→S, X→T, Z→R. 

This suggests that there might be a typo in the problem statement, or I have misread it. 

Alternatively, maybe the original problem has a different labeling. 

Given that the answer choices include 12.5 (option A), which would be the result if the ratio is 5/6, it's possible that the intended correspondence is WX corresponds to ST, making the ratio 5/6. 

Given that this leads to a valid answer choice, and the lack of other clues, I might have made a mistake in assuming the correspondence. 

Let me try this approach. Assume that the ratio is 5/6, giving perimeter 12.5. 

So, final answer A. 

But why would the correspondence be WX to ST? Let me check again. 

If △WXZ ~ △SRT, the correspondence is W→S, X→R, Z→T. So, side WX corresponds to SR, not ST. 

But if the problem meant △WXZ ~ △STR, then the correspondence would be W→S, X→T, Z→R, making WX correspond to ST. 

Perhaps the problem has a typo, and the correct similarity is △WXZ ~ △STR, in which case the ratio is 5/6, leading to perimeter 12.5. 

Given that this leads to an answer choice, and the problem might have a typo, I'll proceed with this. 

Thus, the perimeter of △WXZ is (5/6)*15 =12.5, which is option A. 

Therefore, the correct answer is A.

To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the given information and applying the principles of **similar triangles**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Similarity
We are told that:

$$
\triangle WXZ \sim \triangle SRT
$$

This tells us that the corresponding angles are equal, and the corresponding sides are in **proportion**.

The order of the vertices in the similarity statement is crucial. Specifically:

- $ \angle W \leftrightarrow \angle S $
- $ \angle X \leftrightarrow \angle R $
- $ \angle Z \leftrightarrow \angle T $

Thus, the sides:

- $ WX \leftrightarrow SR $
- $ XZ \leftrightarrow RT $
- $ WZ \leftrightarrow ST $

---

### Step 2: Use Given Information

We are given:

- $ ST = 6 $
- $ WX = 5 $
- Perimeter of $ \triangle SRT = 15 $

Let the scale factor of similarity between $ \triangle WXZ $ and $ \triangle SRT $ be $ k $. Since $ WX \leftrightarrow SR $, we have:

$$
k = \frac{WX}{SR} = \frac{5}{SR}
$$

Also, since $ \triangle WXZ \sim \triangle SRT $, the **perimeter** of $ \triangle WXZ $ will be:

$$
P_{\text{WXZ}} = k \cdot P_{\text{SRT}} = k \cdot 15
$$

Our goal is to find $ P_{\text{WXZ}} $.

---

### Step 3: Determine Scale Factor $ k $

We are told that $ ST = 6 $, and from the similarity, $ WZ \leftrightarrow ST $, so:

$$
WZ = k \cdot ST = k \cdot 6
$$

We also know:

$$
\text{Perimeter of } \triangle SRT = SR + RT + ST = 15
$$

So,

$$
SR + RT = 15 - 6 = 9
$$

Now, from the definition of similarity:

$$
k = \frac{WX}{SR} = \frac{5}{SR}
\Rightarrow SR = \frac{5}{k}
$$

Substitute into $ SR + RT = 9 $:

$$
\frac{5}{k} + RT = 9 \Rightarrow RT = 9 - \frac{5}{k}
$$

Now, recall that:

$$
P_{\text{WXZ}} = 15k
$$

So, the perimeter of $ \triangle WXZ $ is simply $ 15k $, and we just need to find $ k $.

We can use the known side $ WX = 5 $ and $ ST = 6 $, and the correspondence $ WX \leftrightarrow SR $, $ WZ \leftrightarrow ST $, so:

$$
k = \frac{WX}{SR} = \frac{5}{SR}, \quad \text{and} \quad k = \frac{WZ}{ST} = \frac{WZ}{6}
$$

Both expressions are equivalent, and we already used this to derive the relationship between $ SR $, $ RT $, and $ k $.

Instead of solving algebraically, notice that the **ratio of perimeters** of similar triangles is equal to the **scale factor** $ k $. So:

$$
k = \frac{\text{Side of } \triangle WXZ}{\text{Corresponding side of } \triangle SRT}
$$

Since $ WX = 5 $ corresponds to $ SR $, and we do not know $ SR $, but we do know that $ ST = 6 $, which corresponds to $ WZ $, and $ WZ = k \cdot 6 $.

Thus:

$$
k = \frac{WX}{SR} = \frac{5}{SR} = \frac{WZ}{6}
$$

But we also have:

$$
k = \frac{5}{SR} = \frac{WZ}{6}
\Rightarrow WZ = \frac{5}{SR} \cdot 6
$$

Without further side lengths, we turn to the **total perimeter** of $ \triangle SRT = 15 $, and observe that:

$$
k = \frac{WX}{SR} = \frac{5}{SR} \Rightarrow \text{and hence} \quad \frac{5}{SR} = \frac{WZ}{6}
$$

But we are looking for the **perimeter of $ \triangle WXZ $**, which is:

$$
P_{\text{WXZ}} = k \cdot P_{\text{SRT}} = k \cdot 15
$$

Now, if we assume that $ WX $ corresponds to $ ST $, i.e., $ \triangle WXZ \sim \triangle STR $, then:

$$
k = \frac{WX}{ST} = \frac{5}{6}
\Rightarrow P_{\text{WXZ}} = \frac{5}{6} \cdot 15 = 12.5
$$

This aligns perfectly with the given answer choices.

\boxed{A}
