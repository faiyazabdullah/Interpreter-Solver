====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find the length of DF, which is labeled as x. The given information includes some lengths and an angle. Let me try to visualize the problem first.

So, there's a line FG with length 19 units. Then, there's an angle at point G, between points D, G, and F. The measure of that angle is 125 degrees. Also, DG has a length of 15 units. And we need to find DF, which is x.

Hmm. So maybe triangle DGF? Wait, points D, G, F. Let me sketch this mentally. Point G is connected to both D and F. The angle at G is between D and F, so that would make triangle DGF. In triangle DGF, we know two sides: DG = 15 and FG = 19. Wait, but wait—is FG part of the triangle? Or is it another segment?

Wait, hold on. The angle is at G, between D, G, F. That means the angle is ∠DGF, with vertex at G. So the sides forming this angle are GD and GF. Therefore, triangle DGF has sides GD = 15, GF = 19, and angle between them is 125 degrees. Wait, but then the third side would be DF, which is x. Oh! So we can use the Law of Cosines here!

Law of Cosines states that in any triangle, c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(C), where C is the angle opposite side c. In this case, the angle at G is 125 degrees, and the sides adjacent to it are GD (15) and GF (19). So the side opposite the angle is DF, which is x. Therefore:

x² = GD² + GF² - 2 * GD * GF * cos(angle at G)

Plugging in the numbers:

x² = 15² + 19² - 2*15*19*cos(125°)

Let me compute each term step by step.

First, calculate 15 squared: 15^2 = 225

Then 19 squared: 19^2 = 361

Adding those gives 225 + 361 = 586

Now, the next part is 2 * 15 * 19. Let me compute that:

2 * 15 = 30; 30 * 19 = 570

So the equation becomes:

x² = 586 - 570 * cos(125°)

Now, I need to compute cos(125 degrees). But wait, 125 degrees is in the second quadrant, so cosine will be negative there. Let me check the value using calculator.

But since I don't have a calculator here, perhaps I remember that cos(120°) is -0.5, and cos(135°) is approximately -√2/2 ≈ -0.7071. Since 125° is between 120° and 135°, its cosine should be between -0.5 and -0.7071. Maybe around... let me think. Alternatively, convert degrees to radians for calculation, but perhaps I need to approximate.

Alternatively, maybe I can recall exact values or use known approximations. Wait, but for precise calculation, I need to compute cos(125°). Let me try to estimate it.

Alternatively, maybe I can use a calculator-like approach here. Let me think. If I consider that 125 degrees is 180 - 55 degrees, so cos(125°) = -cos(55°). So cos(55°) is approximately... Well, cos(60°) is 0.5, cos(45°) is about 0.7071. So cos(55°) is somewhere between those. Let me check standard angles. For example, cos(55°):

Using a calculator (pretending I can do that), cos(55°) ≈ 0.5736. Therefore, cos(125°) = -0.5736.

Therefore, substituting back into the equation:

x² = 586 - 570*(-0.5736) = 586 + 570*(0.5736)

Compute 570 * 0.5736. Let me compute that:

First, break down 570 * 0.5736:

Well, 500 * 0.5736 = 286.8

70 * 0.5736 = Let's compute 70 * 0.5 = 35, 70 * 0.0736 = ?

Wait, 0.5736 is equal to 0.5 + 0.0736. So:

70 * 0.5 = 35

70 * 0.0736 = 5.152

So total 35 + 5.152 = 40.152

Therefore, total 286.8 + 40.152 = 326.952

So adding that to 586:

x² ≈ 586 + 326.952 = 912.952

Therefore, x ≈ sqrt(912.952)

What's sqrt(912.952)? Let me think. 30^2 = 900, 30.2^2 = ?

Calculate 30.2^2: (30 + 0.2)^2 = 30^2 + 2*30*0.2 + 0.2^2 = 900 + 12 + 0.04 = 912.04

Ah! So 30.2^2 = 912.04. Our value is 912.952, which is slightly higher. Let me compute how much more.

The difference between 912.952 and 912.04 is 0.912. So, let's say x ≈ 30.2 + delta.

Let me denote y = 30.2 + delta. Then,

y² = (30.2)^2 + 2*30.2*delta + delta² = 912.04 + 60.4*delta + delta² ≈ 912.952.

Assuming delta is small, delta² is negligible. So:

60.4*delta ≈ 0.912 → delta ≈ 0.912 / 60.4 ≈ 0.0151.

So x ≈ 30.2 + 0.0151 ≈ 30.2151. Rounded to the nearest tenth, that's 30.2. 

Looking at the answer choices, option B is 30.2. However, wait—let me check my steps again because when I computed x², I had 912.952. But let me verify whether my estimation of cos(125°) was accurate enough. Because if my approximation of cos(55°) was off, that could affect the result.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a better approximation for cos(125°). Let me check using more precise methods. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use a calculator here. Wait, but in reality, during an exam setting, one might use a calculator. Let me try to get a better value for cos(125°). Let me recall that 125 degrees is 90 + 35 degrees. So, cos(125°) = cos(90+35) = -sin(35°). Because cos(90+x) = -sin(x). So sin(35°).

Now, sin(35°) is approximately 0.5736. Which matches my previous value. So cos(125°) ≈ -0.5736. So that seems correct.

Thus, proceeding with that, our calculation for x² is 912.952, leading to x ≈ 30.215. Rounded to the nearest tenth is 30.2, which is option B.

Wait, but looking at the answer choices, option B is 30.2, and option D is 912.9. Wait, but 912.9 is the value of x². Wait, no, the question asks for x, which is the length. So x ≈ 30.2, so answer B.

But let me check once again the computation steps for errors. Let me re-calculate x²:

Original formula: x² = 15² + 19² - 2*15*19*cos(125°)

Which is 225 + 361 - 570 * cos(125°). So 225 + 361 is indeed 586. Then subtracting 570 * cos(125°), but since cos(125°) is negative, it becomes adding 570 * |cos(125°)|. So yes, 586 + 570 * 0.5736 ≈ 586 + 326.952 = 912.952. Correct.

Then square root of 912.952 is indeed approximately 30.2, as shown earlier. Hence, the answer is B.

But wait, let me cross-verify with another method. Suppose I use more accurate value for cos(125°). Let me check using a calculator (pretend I have one). For instance, converting 125 degrees to radians is 125 * π / 180 ≈ 2.1817 radians. Then, calculating cos(2.1817). Using Taylor series might be complicated, but if I recall, cos(125°) ≈ -0.5736. Let me confirm with known decimal places. For example, according to standard calculators, cos(125°) is approximately -0.573576436...

Yes, so my approximation of -0.5736 is very close. Thus, multiplying 570 * 0.573576436 gives:

Let me compute 570 * 0.573576436. Let me compute 570 * 0.5 = 285, 570 * 0.073576436 ≈ ?

First, 0.073576436 * 570:

Breakdown: 0.07 * 570 = 39.9

0.003576436 * 570 ≈ 2.04 (approximate)

Total ≈ 39.9 + 2.04 = 41.94

Thus total 285 + 41.94 = 326.94, which matches our prior calculation. So x² ≈ 586 + 326.94 = 912.94. Square root of that is indeed ~30.2. 

Hence, the correct answer is B. 30.2.

But just to ensure, let me check if I misread the problem. The angle is at G, between D, G, F. So yes, the angle between GD and GF, hence the Law of Cosines applies correctly. The sides adjacent to the angle are GD=15 and GF=19, and the side opposite is DF=x. All steps seem correct. 

Another possible mistake: Did I mix up the angle? For example, if the angle were at D instead, but the problem says MeasureOf(Angle(D, G, F)) which is angle at G. Yes, because the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(D, G, F) is angle at G between D and F. Correct.

Therefore, conclusion: x ≈ 30.2, so answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the unknown length $ x = \text{LengthOf}(DF) $, we begin by analyzing the given geometric configuration:

- We are told that $\angle DGF = 125^\circ$, meaning the angle at vertex $ G $ formed by segments $ GD $ and $ GF $.
- The lengths of the sides adjacent to this angle are:
  - $ GD = 15 $
  - $ GF = 19 $

We aim to find the length of the side opposite the angle — i.e., $ DF = x $. This is a classic scenario for applying the **Law of Cosines**.

---

### Step 1: Apply the Law of Cosines

$$
x^2 = GD^2 + GF^2 - 2 \cdot GD \cdot GF \cdot \cos(\angle DGF)
$$

Substitute the known values:

$$
x^2 = 15^2 + 19^2 - 2 \cdot 15 \cdot 19 \cdot \cos(125^\circ)
$$

$$
x^2 = 225 + 361 - 570 \cdot \cos(125^\circ)
$$

$$
x^2 = 586 - 570 \cdot \cos(125^\circ)
$$

---

### Step 2: Compute $ \cos(125^\circ) $

Since $ 125^\circ $ lies in the second quadrant, cosine is negative. To evaluate:

$$
\cos(125^\circ) = -\cos(55^\circ) \approx -0.5736
$$

Plug this into the expression:

$$
x^2 = 586 - 570 \cdot (-0.5736) = 586 + 570 \cdot 0.5736
$$

$$
570 \cdot 0.5736 \approx 326.952
$$

$$
x^2 \approx 586 + 326.952 = 912.952
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ x $

Take the square root:

$$
x \approx \sqrt{912.952} \approx 30.2
$$

This value rounds to **30.2**, matching one of the provided answer choices.

$$
\boxed{\text{B}}
$$
