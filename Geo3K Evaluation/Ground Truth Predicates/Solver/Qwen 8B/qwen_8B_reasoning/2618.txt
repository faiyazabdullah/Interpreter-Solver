MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, and C. The given information includes some lengths and a perpendicularity condition. Let me jot down the details:

First, the length of line BC is x, which we need to find. Then, the length of AB is 16 units, and AC is 4 units. Also, lines CA and CB are perpendicular. Wait, so line CA and line CB are perpendicular? That means that at point C, the two lines CA and CB form a right angle. So triangle ABC has a right angle at point C?

Wait, hold on. If lines CA and CB are perpendicular, then yes, the angle at C is 90 degrees. Therefore, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at C. But wait, the sides adjacent to the right angle would be AC and BC, and the hypotenuse would be AB. Let me confirm that.

In a right-angled triangle, the Pythagorean theorem applies: (AC)^2 + (BC)^2 = (AB)^2. But here, AC is 4, BC is x, and AB is 16. So substituting these values into the equation:

(4)^2 + (x)^2 = (16)^2  
Which simplifies to 16 + x² = 256  
Then subtract 16 from both sides: x² = 256 - 16 = 240  
So x = sqrt(240). Let me simplify sqrt(240). 

Breaking down 240: 16 * 15 = 240. Because 16*15=240. So sqrt(16*15) = 4*sqrt(15). Therefore, x equals 4√15. 

Looking at the answer choices, option C is 4√15. So that should be the answer. Wait, but let me double-check my reasoning because sometimes I might mix up the sides.

Wait, another thought: Is the right angle at C? The problem says Perpendicular(Line(C,A), Line(C,B)). So line CA and line CB are perpendicular. So point C is connected to A and B, forming two lines that are perpendicular. So yes, angle at C is between CA and CB, hence right angle. Therefore, triangle ABC is right-angled at C. Thus, legs are AC and BC, hypotenuse AB. Hence, Pythagoras applies as above. So calculation seems correct.

But let me check again. Given AC = 4, BC = x, AB = 16. So according to Pythagoras:

AC² + BC² = AB²  
4² + x² = 16²  
16 + x² = 256  
x² = 256 - 16 = 240  
x = √240 = √(16*15) = 4√15. Which matches option C. So answer is C. 

Hmm, but let me make sure there isn't a misunderstanding in the problem setup. For example, could it be that the right angle is at a different vertex? Suppose someone misreads the perpendicularity condition. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The problem states: Perpendicular(Line(C, A), Line(C, B)). So line CA and line CB are perpendicular. So those two lines meet at point C, so the angle between them is 90 degrees. Therefore, the right angle is indeed at point C. So triangle ABC has right angle at C. Therefore, the earlier calculation holds.

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves coordinates? Maybe assigning coordinates to the points can help verify.

Let me try coordinate geometry approach. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0) since the right angle is there. Since CA and CB are perpendicular, let me align them along axes. Let’s say point C is at (0,0). Let me take line CA along the x-axis and line CB along the y-axis. 

Therefore, point A is somewhere along the x-axis. Since AC is 4 units, then coordinates of A would be (4, 0). Similarly, point B is along the y-axis, so its coordinates would be (0, x), since BC is length x. Wait, no. Wait, BC is the length from B to C. Since C is at (0,0), and B is along the y-axis, then coordinates of B would be (0, b), where the distance from C to B is |b|. So BC = |b| = x. Therefore, coordinates of B are (0, x) assuming positive direction. 

Now, point A is at (4, 0). Now, compute AB distance. Coordinates of A (4,0) and B (0,x). Distance AB is sqrt[(4-0)^2 + (0 - x)^2] = sqrt[16 + x^2]. According to the problem, AB is 16. Therefore:

sqrt(16 + x²) = 16  
Square both sides: 16 + x² = 256  
Same equation as before. So x² = 240 => x = sqrt(240) = 4√15. So same conclusion. Therefore, answer is C. 

Therefore, the correct answer is option C. 

I think that's solid. No mistakes detected here. So Final Answer is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we begin by analyzing the given geometric configuration:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Setup**

We are told:

- $ \text{Length}(A, B) = 16 $
- $ \text{Length}(A, C) = 4 $
- $ \text{Length}(B, C) = x $
- Lines $ \overline{CA} $ and $ \overline{CB} $ are **perpendicular**.

This implies that triangle $ \triangle ABC $ is **right-angled at point $ C $**, since the segments $ \overline{CA} $ and $ \overline{CB} $ form a right angle at their common endpoint $ C $.

Thus, triangle $ ABC $ is a **right triangle** with:

- Right angle at $ C $
- Legs: $ AC = 4 $, $ BC = x $
- Hypotenuse: $ AB = 16 $

---

### **Step 2: Use the Pythagorean Theorem**

In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides:

$$
AC^2 + BC^2 = AB^2
$$

Substitute known values:

$$
4^2 + x^2 = 16^2 \\
16 + x^2 = 256
$$

Solving for $ x^2 $:

$$
x^2 = 256 - 16 = 240
$$

Taking the square root:

$$
x = \sqrt{240}
$$

Factorize the radicand:

$$
\sqrt{240} = \sqrt{16 \cdot 15} = 4\sqrt{15}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Match with Answer Choices**

From the options:

- A. $ 2\sqrt{15} $
- B. $ 2\sqrt{17} $
- C. $ 4\sqrt{15} $
- D. $ 4\sqrt{17} $

Our computed value is $ 4\sqrt{15} $, which corresponds to **Option C**.

---

### ✅ **Conclusion**

All steps are logically consistent, and the final computation confirms that the correct value of $ x $ is $ 4\sqrt{15} $.

---

**Final Answer: C**
