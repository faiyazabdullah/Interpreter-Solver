MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, first, I need to visualize the diagram based on the given information. Let me note down all the given constraints:

1. Angle at DBC (Angle D-B-C) is 55 degrees. Wait, actually, the notation might mean angle at point B between points D, B, C? Or maybe it's angle at point D? Wait, no, the standard notation for angles is that the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(D, B, C) would be angle at point B, with segments BD and BC forming the angle. So ∠DBC is 55 degrees. Got it.

Then, MeasureOf(Angle(A, B, D)) is x. That would be angle at point B between points A, B, D. So ∠ABD is x degrees.

Next, MeasureOf(Angle(D, A, B)) is 69 degrees. That's angle at point A between points D, A, B. So ∠DAB is 69 degrees.

Also, line BC is perpendicular to line CD. So lines BC ⊥ CD. Therefore, angle between BC and CD is 90 degrees. So ∠BCD is 90 degrees?

Wait, but the problem mentions angle CDA is 61 degrees. So angle at D between points C, D, A. So ∠CDA = 61°.

We need to find measure of angle ABC, which is angle at point B between points A, B, C. So ∠ABC.

Let me sketch this mentally. Points A, B, C, D. Let me think about how they're connected. Since there's a right angle at C between BC and CD, so point D is such that CD is perpendicular to BC. So if I imagine triangle BCD, with BC and CD being perpendicular. Also, we have points A connected to B and D. Also, angle DAB is 69°, which is angle at A between D and B.

Hmm. Maybe quadrilateral ABCD? But since BC is perpendicular to CD, perhaps ABCD is some quadrilateral with those sides. Alternatively, maybe triangle ABD with some extensions.

Alternatively, let's consider coordinates. Sometimes assigning coordinates helps. Let me try that approach.

Let me place point B at the origin (0,0). Since BC is perpendicular to CD, let me assume BC is along the y-axis and CD is along the x-axis. Wait, because if BC is vertical and CD is horizontal, then their intersection at point C would make them perpendicular. Let me set up coordinates accordingly.

So let me define:

- Point B at (0,0).

Since BC is a line segment, let me suppose point C is somewhere along the positive y-axis. Let me say point C is at (0, c) for some c > 0. Then CD is perpendicular to BC, so CD is horizontal (since BC is vertical). So from point C, moving horizontally. If CD is horizontal, direction depends on whether it's left or right. Let me assume CD goes to the right, so point D is at (d, c) where d > 0. So coordinates:

- B: (0,0)

- C: (0, c)

- D: (d, c)

Now, angle CDA is 61°, which is angle at D between points C, D, A. So ∠CDA is formed by DC and DA. So vector DC is from D to C: (-d, 0), and DA is from D to A: (a_x - d, a_y - c). The angle between these two vectors is 61 degrees.

But also, angle DAB is 69°, which is angle at A between points D, A, B. So ∠DAB is formed by AD and AB. So AB is from A to B, and AD is from A to D.

Additionally, angle DBC is 55°, which is angle at B between D, B, C. So ∠DBC is the angle between BD and BC. Since BC is along the y-axis from B(0,0) to C(0,c), and BD is from B(0,0) to D(d, c). So BD has slope c/d. The angle between BD and BC (which is straight up along y-axis) can be calculated using arctangent of (horizontal change / vertical change). Wait, BD goes from B(0,0) to D(d, c). The angle between BD and BC (the y-axis) would be the angle whose tangent is (horizontal component)/(vertical component). So tan(theta) = (d)/c. Therefore, theta = arctan(d/c). And this angle is given as 55 degrees. So:

arctan(d/c) = 55° ⇒ d/c = tan(55°). Let me compute tan(55°). Approximately tan(55°) ≈ 1.4281. So d = c * 1.4281.

But maybe exact values aren't necessary yet. Let me keep it symbolic for now.

Now, angle DAB is 69°, which is at point A between D and B. So if I can find coordinates of point A, maybe I can use that. But how?

Alternatively, maybe considering triangles. Let's look at triangle ABD. We know angle at A (∠DAB = 69°), and we might relate other angles if we can find more info.

Wait, but point A is connected to D and B. Also, we have angle CDA = 69°? No, wait, angle CDA is 61°, as given. Let me recheck:

Given: m∠CDA = 61°, which is angle at D between C, D, A. So in triangle CDA, angle at D is 61°, and we might relate other angles.

Also, in triangle CDA, we can consider sides and angles. However, without knowing side lengths, maybe it's tricky. Perhaps using coordinate geometry is better.

Let me attempt to assign coordinates step by step.

First, set B at (0,0), C at (0, c), D at (d, c). Now, need to find coordinates of point A such that ∠DAB = 69°, and angle CDA = 61°.

Let me denote point A as (x, y). Then, we can write equations based on angles.

First, angle DAB is 69°. This is the angle between vectors AD and AB.

Vector AD is D - A = (d - x, c - y).

Vector AB is B - A = (0 - x, 0 - y) = (-x, -y).

The angle between vectors AD and AB is 69°, so using the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (AD · AB) / (|AD| |AB|)

So,

[ (d - x)(-x) + (c - y)(-y) ] / [ sqrt((d - x)^2 + (c - y)^2) * sqrt(x^2 + y^2) ) ] = cos(69°)

That seems complicated. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, since we have some known angles, maybe looking for cyclic quadrilaterals or something else.

Wait, also, since BC is perpendicular to CD, then BC ⊥ CD. So in terms of slopes, BC is vertical (as we placed earlier), CD is horizontal. So CD is horizontal, meaning that point D lies directly to the right of C (if we took our previous setup). So CD is horizontal, hence, the line CD is horizontal, so point D is (d, c) as before.

Now, angle CDA is 61°, which is angle at D between C and A. So in triangle CDA, angle at D is 61°, with DC being horizontal from D to C (leftward), and DA going to point A. So the angle between DC (which is pointing towards C, i.e., to the left) and DA is 61 degrees.

Therefore, if we consider triangle CDA, with DC length is d units (from D(d,c) to C(0,c) is distance d), and DA is some length, and angle at D is 61°. But without knowing other sides, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe using Law of Sines or Cosines in triangle CDA.

But again, without knowing sides, maybe difficult. Let me think about other parts.

Also, angle at B, ∠DBC is 55°, which we related to the slope earlier. Also, we had angle ABD is x, which is part of angle ABC. Because angle ABC is made up of angles ABD and DBC? Wait, if point D is connected to B, then angle ABC could be split into angle ABD and angle DBC. Wait, but only if D lies on the same plane and such that BD is inside the angle ABC. Is that necessarily true?

Wait, point D is connected to B and C, and we have BC perpendicular to CD. Depending on where A is, but assuming that A is connected to B and D. Hmm. Maybe the diagram is such that ABCD is a quadrilateral with BC perpendicular to CD, and A connected to B and D.

Assuming that, then angle ABC is composed of angles ABD and DBC. So ∠ABC = ∠ABD + ∠DBC. Given that ∠DBC is 55°, and ∠ABD is x, then ∠ABC = x + 55°. But we need to find ∠ABC, so if we can find x, then add 55°.

But how do we find x?

We also know that ∠DAB = 69°, which is angle at A between D and B. So in triangle ABD, we have angle at A is 69°, angle at B is x, and angle at D is... Well, unless we know more about triangle ABD, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, but maybe considering triangle ABD and triangle ADC?

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle ABD and triangle CDA. But not sure.

Alternatively, since we have coordinates, perhaps trying to express relations.

Earlier, we had that in triangle CDA, angle at D is 61°, DC = d, and DA is some length. Also, in triangle ABD, angle at A is 69°, etc.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinates to find relations. For example, since angle CDA is 61°, and DC is horizontal from D to C (leftwards), then the line DA makes an angle of 61° above or below DC. Since angle is measured between DC and DA, depending on direction.

If DC is pointing to the left (from D to C), then DA is making 61° with DC. So if we imagine standing at point D, facing towards C (to the left), then turning 61° towards A. The direction of DA would depend on where A is. Assuming A is somewhere such that the angle is 61°, maybe upwards or downwards.

Alternatively, if we take the slope of DA. Let me consider coordinates again. Suppose point D is at (d, c), point C is at (0, c). So DC is horizontal. The angle between DC (which is leftward) and DA is 61°, so the slope of DA can be determined.

Let me think. From point D, the direction of DC is towards the left (negative x-direction). The angle between DC and DA is 61°, so DA forms 61° with DC. So if I imagine at point D, the line DC is left, and DA is making 61° from DC. Depending on which way, DA could go upward or downward.

Assuming that A is positioned such that the angle is 61°, and given that there's also angle DAB = 69°, likely A is above the x-axis.

Let me try to model this. Let me consider the line DA making an angle of 61° with DC (which is leftward). So if I'm at point D, facing left along DC, then turning 61° upwards (counterclockwise) would head into the upper half-plane, or turning 61° downwards (clockwise) would head into lower half-plane. Which one is it?

Well, if we consider that angle DAB is 69°, which is at point A between D and B. If A were below the x-axis, then connecting A to B (which is at (0,0)) might create different angles. It's possible either way, but maybe we need to figure out based on other constraints.

Alternatively, let's consider the slope of DA. Let me denote the slope as m. Since DC is horizontal leftward, the direction of DC is along negative x-axis. The angle between DA and DC is 61°, so the slope of DA can be determined based on that angle.

If we consider that from point D, moving at an angle of 61° relative to DC (which is leftward), then the direction of DA is 61° above or below the leftward direction.

So, if we take the angle between DA and DC as 61°, then the slope of DA would correspond to tan(θ), where θ is the angle from the leftward direction. So if it's above, then the slope would be tan(61°) upward from leftward direction. Wait, slope is rise over run. If from point D, moving leftward (negative x) and upwards (positive y), then the slope would be Δy/Δx. But since Δx is negative (moving left), and Δy is positive (upwards), the slope is positive (because negative divided by negative?), Wait:

Wait, slope is (change in y)/(change in x). If from D to A, moving left (so Δx is negative) and upwards (Δy is positive), then slope is positive (positive/negative? No, wait, if you move from D to A, then Δx = A.x - D.x, Δy = A.y - D.y.

Suppose DA has a direction such that from D, moving left and upwards, so Δx is negative (since moving left from D), and Δy is positive. So slope is Δy / Δx = positive / negative = negative. So slope is negative. But the angle between DA and DC (which is leftward) is 61°, so the angle between DA and the negative x-axis is 61°, implying that the slope is tan(61°) in magnitude, but negative.

Wait, if the angle between DA and DC (leftward) is 61°, then the slope would be tan(61°) in the direction of that angle. Since the direction of DA is 61° above the leftward direction (i.e., from DC), then the slope would be tan(61°), but since it's in the second quadrant (left and up), the slope would be positive? Wait, no. Wait, if you are going left and up, then the slope is positive? Wait, no. Let me think.

Imagine a line going to the left (negative x) and upwards (positive y). So from point D, moving left and up. The slope is rise over run. Run is negative (because moving left), rise is positive. So slope is positive / negative = negative. So the slope is negative. The angle between DA and the negative x-axis is 61°, so the slope is tan(angle) = tan(61°), but since it's in the second quadrant, the actual slope would be -tan(61°). Wait, no. Wait, the slope is equal to tan(theta), where theta is the angle between the line and the positive x-axis. But here, the angle is with respect to the negative x-axis. So if the angle between DA and the negative x-axis is 61°, then the angle with the positive x-axis would be 180° - 61° = 119°, so tan(119°) = tan(180° - 61°) = -tan(61°). Hence, the slope is -tan(61°).

So slope of DA is -tan(61°). Therefore, equation of line DA is:

(y - c) = -tan(61°)(x - d)

Because it passes through D(d, c).

So that's one equation involving point A(x,y). Also, we know that angle DAB is 69°, which involves point A, B, and D.

Point B is at (0,0). So angle at A between points D and B. To find this angle, we need to relate the slopes of AD and AB.

Alternatively, using the law of sines or cosines in triangle ABD.

But maybe combining the two equations.

Alternatively, since we have the slope of DA, and we can find coordinates of A in terms of variables.

But this might get complex. Let me see.

From the equation of DA: y - c = -tan(61°)(x - d). So y = -tan(61°)x + d tan(61°) + c.

But point A lies on this line. Also, angle DAB is 69°, which is the angle between DA and BA. So, using coordinates, maybe we can write tan(angle DAB) = ?

Alternatively, using vectors. The angle between vectors AD and AB is 69°. Earlier, I wrote the dot product formula, which relates the cosine of the angle between vectors.

Let me recall that:

cos(theta) = (AD · AB) / (|AD| |AB| )

Where AD vector is from A to D: (d - x, c - y)

AB vector is from A to B: (0 - x, 0 - y) = (-x, -y)

Their dot product is (d - x)(-x) + (c - y)(-y) = -xd + x² - yc + y²

The magnitudes are |AD| = sqrt( (d - x)^2 + (c - y)^2 ), and |AB| = sqrt(x² + y² )

So:

[ -xd + x² - yc + y² ] / [ sqrt(...)*sqrt(...) ] = cos(69°)

This seems too abstract. Maybe instead, since we have the slope of DA, and we can parametrize point A.

Alternatively, let me consider specific values. Let me assign some numerical values to simplify calculations.

Let me assume that BC is of length 1 unit for simplicity. Let’s say c = 1. Then, since arctan(d/c) = 55°, so d = tan(55°). Let me calculate tan(55°):

tan(55°) ≈ 1.4281. So d ≈ 1.4281.

So coordinates:

- B: (0, 0)

- C: (0, 1)

- D: (1.4281, 1)

Now, equation of DA: y - 1 = -tan(61°)(x - 1.4281). Let me compute tan(61°): tan(61°) ≈ 1.8040.

Thus, equation becomes:

y = -1.8040(x - 1.4281) + 1

= -1.8040x + 1.8040*1.4281 + 1

Calculate 1.8040 * 1.4281:

Approximately 1.8040 * 1.4281 ≈ 2.575. So y ≈ -1.8040x + 2.575 + 1 = -1.8040x + 3.575.

So point A lies on this line. Now, we need to find coordinates of A such that angle DAB is 69°.

Let me denote point A as (x, y) lying on this line. Also, angle DAB is 69°, which is the angle between DA and BA.

To find this angle, perhaps using the tangent of the angle between two lines.

The slope of DA is already known as -1.8040. The slope of BA is (y - 0)/(x - 0) = y/x.

So the angle between DA and BA can be found via:

tan(theta) = |(m2 - m1)/(1 + m1*m2)|, where m1 and m2 are the slopes.

Here, m1 is slope of DA: m1 = -1.8040

m2 is slope of BA: m2 = y/x

So tan(theta) = |(m2 - m1)/(1 + m1*m2)| = tan(69°)

Let me compute tan(69°) ≈ 2.605.

So:

|(y/x + 1.8040)/(1 + (-1.8040)*(y/x))| = 2.605

But since point A lies on the line y = -1.8040x + 3.575, we can substitute y:

y = -1.8040x + 3.575

So y/x = (-1.8040x + 3.575)/x = -1.8040 + 3.575/x

Let me denote k = y/x = -1.8040 + 3.575/x

Substitute into tan(theta):

| (k + 1.8040) / (1 - 1.8040*k) | = 2.605

So:

| (k + 1.8040) / (1 - 1.8040*k) | = 2.605

Let me expand this:

(k + 1.8040) / (1 - 1.8040*k) = ±2.605

Let me solve for k.

Case 1: Positive sign:

(k + 1.8040) = 2.605*(1 - 1.8040*k)

Expand RHS: 2.605 - 2.605*1.8040*k

Bring all terms to LHS:

k + 1.8040 - 2.605 + 2.605*1.8040*k = 0

Combine like terms:

k + (2.605*1.8040)*k = (2.605 - 1.8040)

Compute coefficients:

First, compute 2.605*1.8040 ≈ 2.605 * 1.804 ≈ approx 4.70

So approximately:

k + 4.70k = 0.801 => 5.70k ≈ 0.801 => k ≈ 0.801 / 5.70 ≈ 0.1405

Case 2: Negative sign:

(k + 1.8040) = -2.605*(1 - 1.8040*k)

Expanding RHS: -2.605 + 2.605*1.8040*k

Bring all terms to LHS:

k + 1.8040 + 2.605 - 2.605*1.8040*k = 0

Combine like terms:

k - (2.605*1.8040)*k = - (1.8040 + 2.605)

Again, approximate 2.605*1.804 ≈ 4.70

So:

k - 4.70k = -4.409 => -3.70k = -4.409 => k ≈ 4.409 / 3.70 ≈ 1.1916

So we have two possibilities for k: ~0.1405 or ~1.1916

Recall that k = y/x = (-1.8040 + 3.575/x)

So let's consider both cases.

First case: k ≈ 0.1405

Then:

y/x ≈ 0.1405 → y ≈ 0.1405x

But from the equation of DA: y = -1.8040x + 3.575

So substituting y ≈ 0.1405x into that:

0.1405x = -1.8040x + 3.575

→ 0.1405x + 1.8040x = 3.575

→ 1.9445x = 3.575 → x ≈ 3.575 / 1.9445 ≈ 1.838

Then y ≈ 0.1405 * 1.838 ≈ 0.258

So point A is approximately (1.838, 0.258). Let me check if this makes sense.

Second case: k ≈ 1.1916

Then y/x ≈ 1.1916 → y ≈ 1.1916x

Plug into DA equation:

1.1916x = -1.8040x + 3.575 → 1.1916x + 1.8040x = 3.575 → 2.9956x ≈ 3.575 → x ≈ 3.575 / 2.9956 ≈ 1.193

Then y ≈ 1.1916 * 1.193 ≈ 1.423

So point A is approximately (1.193, 1.423)

Now, we need to determine which of these solutions is valid based on the diagram.

Let me think about the positions.

In the first case, point A is at (≈1.838, 0.258), which is to the right of point D (which is at x ≈1.428) and slightly above the x-axis. In this case, connecting A to B (0,0) would create an angle at A between D and B. 

In the second case, point A is at (≈1.193, 1.423), which is to the left of D (x ≈1.428), and higher up. 

Which one makes sense with angle DAB being 69°?

It's hard to tell without visualizing, but let's test with both possibilities.

First, check the first case: A ≈ (1.838, 0.258)

Compute vectors AD and AB.

Vector AD is D - A: (1.4281 - 1.838, 1 - 0.258) ≈ (-0.4099, 0.742)

Vector AB is B - A: (0 - 1.838, 0 - 0.258) ≈ (-1.838, -0.258)

Compute the angle between these vectors.

Dot product: (-0.4099)(-1.838) + (0.742)(-0.258) ≈ 0.755 - 0.191 ≈ 0.564

Magnitude of AD: sqrt((-0.4099)^2 + 0.742^2) ≈ sqrt(0.168 + 0.550) ≈ sqrt(0.718) ≈ 0.847

Magnitude of AB: sqrt( (-1.838)^2 + (-0.258)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(3.378 + 0.066) ≈ sqrt(3.444) ≈ 1.856

Cosine of angle: 0.564 / (0.847 * 1.856) ≈ 0.564 / 1.572 ≈ 0.358

Which corresponds to angle ≈ arccos(0.358) ≈ 69°, since cos(69°) ≈ 0.358. Yes! So this case works.

For the second case, point A ≈ (1.193, 1.423). Compute vectors AD and AB.

Vector AD: D - A: (1.4281 - 1.193, 1 - 1.423) ≈ (0.235, -0.423)

Vector AB: B - A: (0 - 1.193, 0 - 1.423) ≈ (-1.193, -1.423)

Dot product: (0.235)(-1.193) + (-0.423)(-1.423) ≈ -0.280 + 0.599 ≈ 0.319

Magnitude of AD: sqrt(0.235² + (-0.423)²) ≈ sqrt(0.055 + 0.179) ≈ sqrt(0.234) ≈ 0.484

Magnitude of AB: sqrt( (-1.193)^2 + (-1.423)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(1.423 + 2.025) ≈ sqrt(3.448) ≈ 1.857

Cosine of angle: 0.319 / (0.484 * 1.857) ≈ 0.319 / 0.899 ≈ 0.355, which is close to cos(69°) ≈ 0.358. So this also gives an angle near 69°, but slightly less. Could be due to approximation errors in manual calculation. So both cases seem possible. How to decide which one is correct?

Looking back at the angle CDA = 61°, which was used to derive the slope of DA. In both cases, the position of A affects that angle. Wait, but we derived the slope of DA based on angle CDA = 61°, so both cases should satisfy that condition? Or did we fix that already?

Actually, when we derived the slope of DA, we considered angle CDA = 61°, so regardless of where A is, as long as it lies on that line, that angle is satisfied. So both cases are valid? Or is there another constraint?

Wait, but angle DAB is 69°, which we used to find k. Both cases satisfy that. So why two solutions?

Possibly because the angle between DA and BA could be 69° in two different orientations. However, given the rest of the diagram, perhaps only one of them makes sense.

Let me check with the second case: point A ≈ (1.193, 1.423). Let's check if this creates any contradictions.

In this case, point A is above and to the left of D. Connecting A to B would cross through the diagram. But does this affect anything else?

Alternatively, since we are to find angle ABC, which is at point B between A and C. Let me consider both cases.

First case: A ≈ (1.838, 0.258). So point A is to the right of D, low. Then angle ABC is the angle at B between A and C. Since point C is at (0,1), and point A is at (1.838, 0.258). So BA is from B(0,0) to A(1.838, 0.258), and BC is from B(0,0) to C(0,1). So angle ABC is between BA and BC.

To compute angle ABC, which is the angle between BA and BC. Vector BA is from B to A: (1.838, 0.258). Vector BC is from B to C: (0,1).

The angle between BA and BC can be computed using the dot product:

cos(theta) = (BA · BC) / (|BA| |BC|)

BA · BC = (1.838)(0) + (0.258)(1) = 0.258

|BA| = sqrt(1.838² + 0.258²) ≈ sqrt(3.378 + 0.066) ≈ sqrt(3.444) ≈ 1.856

|BC| = sqrt(0² + 1²) = 1

So cos(theta) ≈ 0.258 / 1.856 ≈ 0.139, which implies theta ≈ 82°. Not matching any answer choices except possibly none, but let's check the second case.

Second case: A ≈ (1.193, 1.423). So vector BA is from B(0,0) to A(1.193, 1.423): (1.193, 1.423). Vector BC is (0,1).

Dot product BA · BC = 1.193*0 + 1.423*1 = 1.423

|BA| = sqrt(1.193² + 1.423²) ≈ sqrt(1.423 + 2.025) ≈ sqrt(3.448) ≈ 1.857

|BC| = 1

cos(theta) = 1.423 / 1.857 ≈ 0.766, which is cos(theta) ≈ 0.766 → theta ≈ 40°, which is not among the answer choices either. Wait, but the answer choices are 55, 69, 85, 140. Neither 82 nor 40 are there. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, but the question asks for m∠ABC, which is angle at B between A and C. Wait, but in my assumption, I considered angle ABC as the angle between BA and BC. But maybe there's another consideration.

Wait, but earlier I thought that ∠ABC is composed of ∠ABD and ∠DBC. If that's the case, then ∠ABC = x + 55°, where x is ∠ABD. But in this scenario, if I can find x, then adding 55° gives ∠ABC.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps I need to reconsider the structure of the diagram. Perhaps point A is located such that ABCD is a quadrilateral with certain properties.

Wait, if I consider the first case where A is at (1.838, 0.258), then angle ABC is around 82°, which isn't an option. Second case gives around 40°, also not. But the answer choices include 55, 69, 85, 140. So maybe my assumption about the placement of A is wrong?

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in calculating the angle. Let me re-examine the second case.

In the second case, point A is (1.193, 1.423). Vector BA is (1.193, 1.423), vector BC is (0,1). The angle between them is calculated as:

cos(theta) = (1.423)/(sqrt(1.193² + 1.423²)) ≈ 1.423 / 1.857 ≈ 0.766, which is cos(theta) ≈ 0.766. What angle is this? cos⁻¹(0.766) ≈ 40°, yes. But 40° isn't an option. However, maybe there's a mistake in assumptions.

Wait, let's think differently. Perhaps the diagram isn't as I assumed. Maybe point A is not in the position I considered. Maybe I need to use other relationships.

Let me recall that angle CDA is 61°, which we've already incorporated into the slope of DA. Also, we have ∠DAB = 69°, which gave us two possibilities for point A. But neither led to an answer matching the choices. So maybe there's a different approach.

Let me try to focus on triangle ABD and triangle CDA.

In triangle ABD, we have angle at A = 69°, angle at B = x, angle at D = ?

Sum of angles is 180°, so angle at D is 180 - 69 - x = 111 - x.

In triangle CDA, angle at D is 61°, angle at C is ? , angle at A is ?

Wait, but we don't know much about triangle CDA. But maybe relating angles through other means.

Alternatively, since BC is perpendicular to CD, then angle BCD is 90°, as BC ⊥ CD. Wait, angle at C between B and D? Wait, point C is connected to B and D? No, point C is connected to B and D? Wait, original diagram: points are A, B, C, D. BC is perpendicular to CD, so at point C, lines CB and CD are perpendicular. So angle BCD is 90°, as CB is one leg and CD is the other.

So in triangle BCD, right-angled at C. So angle at C is 90°, angle at B is ∠CBD, which is part of the given angle ∠DBC = 55°. Wait, earlier we said ∠DBC = 55°, which is angle at B between D and C. So in triangle BCD, angle at B is 55°, angle at C is 90°, so angle at D is 180 - 55 - 90 = 35°. So ∠BDC = 35°.

But ∠BDC is angle at D between B and C. So in triangle BCD, ∠BDC = 35°. Now, what is ∠ADC? Wait, ∠ADC is part of angle CDA = 61°. Wait, angle CDA is at D between C and A. So if we can relate ∠ADC with other angles.

At point D, we have angle CDA = 61°, and angle BDC = 35°. Are these adjacent angles? If points A, B, C, D form a quadrilateral, then at point D, the angles around it would be ∠ADC (61°) and ∠ADB (whatever it is). But unless points are arranged in a certain way.

Alternatively, considering triangle ADC, where we know ∠ADC = 61°, and if we can find other angles.

But how?

Wait, in triangle ADC, we have ∠ADC = 61°, and if we can find another angle, we can find the third.

But what is ∠DAC? That is, angle at A between D and C. Which is part of angle DAB = 69°, if point C is connected to A. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, if we consider that in triangle ABD, angle at D is 111 - x, as previously mentioned. And in triangle ADC, angle at D is 61°. Are these angles supplementary or something?

Wait, if points B, D, and C are arranged such that angle at D between B and C is 35°, and angle at D between C and A is 61°, then total angle around point D would be 35° + 61° = 96°, unless there are other angles. But if the diagram is planar, the sum of angles around D should be 360°, but unless there are other lines.

Alternatively, if points A, B, C, D are arranged such that D is connected to A, B, and C. So at point D, we have three angles: ∠ADC (61°), ∠ADB (some value), and ∠BDC (35°). But unless there's more info, it's unclear.

Alternatively, focusing on triangle ABD and triangle CBD.

Wait, in triangle ABD, we have angle at A = 69°, angle at B = x, angle at D = 111 - x.

In triangle CBD, we have angle at B = 55°, angle at C = 90°, angle at D = 35°.

Now, if we can find relationship between angle at D in triangle ABD and triangle CBD.

At point D, the angle between BD and CD is 35° (from triangle CBD), and the angle between CD and DA is 61° (given). If these angles are adjacent, then the total angle at D between BD and DA would be 35° + 61° = 96°. So in triangle ABD, angle at D is 96°, which would mean:

In triangle ABD: angle at D = 96°, angle at A = 69°, angle at B = x. So sum is 69 + x + 96 = 165 + x = 180 → x = 15°. Then angle ABC = x + 55° = 15 + 55 = 70°, which is not among the choices. Closest is 69 (option B) or 85 (option C). But this is speculative.

Wait, but this assumes that the angles at D are additive, which may not be the case. Why? Because if at point D, the angle between BD and CD is 35°, and between CD and DA is 61°, then the angle between BD and DA would be 35° + 61° = 96°, assuming that those angles are adjacent. But is that the case?

Yes, if points B, C, A are arranged such that from D, you have line DC, then DA, and DB. If the order is such that from D, the lines are DC, then DA, and DB, then the angle between DB and DA would indeed be the sum of the angles between DB and DC, and DC and DA. But this requires that the points are arranged in that order around D.

Assuming that, then angle at D in triangle ABD is 96°, leading to x = 15°, giving angle ABC = 70°, which isn't an option. But closest is 69° (B) or 85° (C). However, this suggests that my previous assumption might be incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the angle at D in triangle ABD is not 96°, but something else. For example, if the angle between DA and DB is not the sum of the other two angles, but depends on the configuration.

Alternatively, let's consider that in triangle ABD, angle at D is the angle between DA and DB. If at point D, the angle between DA and DC is 61°, and between DC and DB is 35°, then the angle between DA and DB would be 61° - 35° = 26°, if DA is on the opposite side of DC from DB. Or 35° + 61° = 96°, if they are on the same side.

But how to know? Depends on the diagram.

If the diagram is such that from point D, DA is extending away from BC, then the angle between DA and DB would be 61° + 35° = 96°. Alternatively, if DA is on the other side, it could be 61° - 35° = 26°, but that would require DA to be between DC and DB, which might not be the case.

Assuming the former, angle at D in triangle ABD is 96°, leading to x = 15°, and angle ABC = 70°, which is not an option. But since this is not an option, perhaps the assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, if the angle at D is 61° - 35° = 26°, then in triangle ABD, angles are 69° at A, 26° at D, so angle at B is x = 180 - 69 - 26 = 85°. Then angle ABC = x + 55° = 85 + 55 = 140°, which is option D!

Wait, this matches one of the answer choices. Let me verify this logic.

If at point D, the angle between DA and DB is 26°, then in triangle ABD, angle at D is 26°, angle at A is 69°, so angle at B (x) is 180 - 69 - 26 = 85°. Then ∠ABC = x + 55° = 85 + 55 = 140°, which is option D.

But why would the angle at D be 61° - 35° = 26°? That would be if DA is on the opposite side of DC from DB, such that the angle between DA and DC is 61°, and between DC and DB is 35°, making the angle between DA and DB as 61° - 35° = 26°. This would happen if DA is on the same side of DC as DB, but closer to DC. 

This seems plausible. So let's accept this possibility. Thus, angle at D in triangle ABD is 26°, leading to x = 85°, and thus angle ABC = 85 + 55 = 140°, which is option D.

But why did the coordinate approach give conflicting results? Maybe because of the assumption of where A is located. Perhaps in that approach, I made an error in assuming the slope of DA, or misapplied the angle.

Alternatively, this method uses the fact that at point D, the angles around it sum up appropriately. Since angle between DC and DA is 61°, and between DC and DB is 35°, then depending on the arrangement, the angle between DA and DB is 61 - 35 = 26°, leading to the conclusion.

This seems logical, and leads to answer D, 140°, which is one of the choices. So perhaps this is the correct approach.

Let me verify this with another perspective.

In triangle BCD, we have ∠BDC = 35°, as established earlier. At point D, we also have ∠ADC = 61°. If these two angles are adjacent, then the total angle between BD and DA would be 61° + 35° = 96°, or 61° - 35° = 26°, depending on the orientation.

But how to determine which it is?

If we assume that points A, C, and B are arranged such that DA is on the same side of DC as DB, then the angle between DA and DB would be 61° - 35° = 26°. Otherwise, it would be 61° + 35° = 96°.

If we assume the latter (96°), then x = 15°, giving ABC = 70°, which is not an option. But if we assume the former (26°), giving x = 85°, ABC = 140°, which is option D.

Since 140° is an option, and the other possibility does not match, this suggests that the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, let's think about the sum of angles in the diagram.

If angle ABC is 140°, then in triangle ABD, x = 85°, and angle at D is 26°, which would mean that in triangle ABD, the angles are 69°, 85°, 26°, summing to 180°, which checks out.

Additionally, in triangle BCD, angles are 55°, 90°, 35°, which also sums to 180°.

Thus, this seems consistent.

Hence, the correct answer is D. 140°.

To solve the problem, we begin by interpreting the geometric constraints and identifying the key elements of the diagram.

### **Step 1: Understand the Given Information**

We are told:

1. $ \angle DBC = 55^\circ $
   - This is the angle at point $ B $, between segments $ BD $ and $ BC $

2. $ \angle ABD = x $
   - This is the angle at point $ B $, between segments $ AB $ and $ BD $

3. $ \angle DAB = 69^\circ $
   - This is the angle at point $ A $, between segments $ AD $ and $ AB $

4. $ \angle CDA = 61^\circ $
   - This is the angle at point $ D $, between segments $ CD $ and $ DA $

5. $ \overline{BC} \perp \overline{CD} $
   - So $ \angle BCD = 90^\circ $

Our goal is to find the measure of $ \angle ABC $, which is the angle at point $ B $ between segments $ AB $ and $ BC $.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze Triangle $ BCD $**

We start by analyzing triangle $ BCD $:

- $ \angle BCD = 90^\circ $ (right angle)
- $ \angle DBC = 55^\circ $ (given)
- So, using the triangle angle sum property:

$$
\angle BDC = 180^\circ - \angle BCD - \angle DBC = 180^\circ - 90^\circ - 55^\circ = 35^\circ
$$

So, $ \angle BDC = 35^\circ $

---

### **Step 3: Consider Point $ D $'s Angles Around It**

At point $ D $, we are given:

- $ \angle CDA = 61^\circ $ (between $ CD $ and $ DA $)
- $ \angle BDC = 35^\circ $ (between $ CD $ and $ DB $)

These two angles are adjacent at point $ D $, and together they describe the angle between $ DB $ and $ DA $. Since $ \angle CDA $ and $ \angle BDC $ share a common side $ CD $, and are on opposite sides of it, the angle between $ DB $ and $ DA $ is the difference:

$$
\angle BDA = \angle CDA - \angle BDC = 61^\circ - 35^\circ = 26^\circ
$$

---

### **Step 4: Use Triangle $ ABD $ to Find $ x $**

Now consider triangle $ ABD $:

- $ \angle DAB = 69^\circ $
- $ \angle ABD = x $
- $ \angle ADB = 26^\circ $ (calculated above)

Using the triangle angle sum:

$$
\angle DAB + \angle ABD + \angle ADB = 180^\circ \\
69^\circ + x + 26^\circ = 180^\circ \\
x = 180^\circ - 69^\circ - 26^\circ = 85^\circ
$$

---

### **Step 5: Calculate $ \angle ABC $**

Finally, observe that:

- $ \angle ABC = \angle ABD + \angle DBC = x + 55^\circ = 85^\circ + 55^\circ = 140^\circ $

---
