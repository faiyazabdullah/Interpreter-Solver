MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. The problem says that angles 1 and 2 form a linear pair, and the measure of angle 2 is 67 degrees. I need to find the measure of angle 1. 

First, I remember that a linear pair consists of two adjacent angles whose non-common sides form a straight line. That means they are supplementary, right? So their measures add up to 180 degrees. Wait, so if angle 1 and angle 2 are a linear pair, then m∠1 + m∠2 = 180°. 

Given that m∠2 is 67°, then m∠1 would be 180° minus 67°. Let me calculate that. 180 minus 60 is 120, and then subtract another 7, which gives 113. So 113 degrees. 

Looking at the answer choices, option B is 113. But wait, let me make sure there aren't any other constraints from the geometric setup mentioned. The problem also includes some points and lines: Point C lies on line AD. Also, angles at point C involving points B and D. But maybe those details are just part of the diagram but not directly affecting the relationship between angles 1 and 2 since they're stated to form a linear pair. 

So even though there might be more to the figure, the key information here is that angles 1 and 2 are a linear pair. Therefore, their sum should be 180°, making angle 1 equal to 113°. 

I don't think there's anything else to consider here. The answer should be B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The problem states that ∠1 and ∠2 form a linear pair, meaning they are adjacent angles whose non-common sides form a straight line. By definition, a linear pair of angles is supplementary, so their measures add up to 180°. Given that $ m\angle 2 = 67^\circ $, we can compute $ m\angle 1 $ as follows:

$$
m\angle 1 = 180^\circ - m\angle 2 = 180^\circ - 67^\circ = 113^\circ
$$

The geometric constraints (e.g., point C lying on line AD) do not affect this calculation because the relationship between ∠1 and ∠2 is explicitly defined as a linear pair. Thus, the measure of ∠1 is **113°**, corresponding to answer choice **B**.

Final Answer: B
