MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find the length x, which is the length of line BC. The given information includes that AC is 7 units long, angle at point B (angle ABC) is 30 degrees, and lines AC and AB are perpendicular. Wait, hold on. Let me parse the constraints again carefully.

The problem states:

- Length of BC is x.
- Length of AB is y.
- Length of AC is 7.
- Measure of angle at B (angle ABC) is 30 degrees.
- Line AC is perpendicular to line AB.

Wait, so line AC is perpendicular to line AB? That means that angle at A between AB and AC is 90 degrees? Because perpendicular lines form a right angle. So triangle ABC has a right angle at A?

But then angle at B is 30 degrees. Let me try to visualize this. Let me sketch mentally. Points A, B, C. AB and AC are perpendicular. So if we consider point A as the vertex where AB and AC meet, forming a right angle. Therefore, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at A. But wait, angle at B is 30 degrees. In a right-angled triangle, the angles other than the right angle add up to 90 degrees. So angle at B is 30, angle at C would be 60 degrees. 

So triangle ABC is right-angled at A, with angle at B being 30 degrees, hypotenuse BC. Wait, but in a right-angled triangle, the sides can be related using trigonometric ratios. Let me recall. If it's right-angled at A, then side opposite to angle B is AC. Wait, no. Let me think about the triangle.

In triangle ABC, right-angled at A. So sides AB and AC are the legs, and BC is the hypotenuse. Then angle at B is 30 degrees. Let me label the sides accordingly. The side opposite angle B is AC. The side adjacent to angle B is AB. And the hypotenuse is BC.

So in terms of trigonometry, for angle B (which is 30 degrees), tan(angle B) = opposite / adjacent = AC / AB. So tan(30°) = AC / AB. Since AC is given as 7, and AB is y, then tan(30°) = 7 / y. Solving for y gives y = 7 / tan(30°). But tan(30°) is 1/√3, so y = 7 * √3. However, the question asks for x, which is BC, the hypotenuse. 

Alternatively, since it's a right-angled triangle, we can use Pythagoras theorem. But maybe using sine or cosine would help. For example, sin(angle B) = opposite / hypotenuse = AC / BC. So sin(30°) = 7 / x. Since sin(30°) is 1/2, then 1/2 = 7/x → x = 14. Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me check again.

If angle at B is 30°, then in triangle ABC, with right angle at A, then BC is the hypotenuse. So yes, sin(30°) equals the opposite side over hypotenuse. The opposite side to angle B is AC, which is 7. Therefore, sin(30°)=7/x ⇒ x=14. So the answer would be D. 14. But let me make sure there isn't a mistake here.

Alternatively, using Pythagoras. Since AB is y, AC is 7, BC is x. So x² = y² + 7². Also, from earlier, tan(30°) = 7/y ⇒ y = 7 / tan(30°). Since tan(30°) is 1/√3, then y = 7√3. Plugging back into Pythagoras: x² = (7√3)² + 7² = 49*3 + 49 = 49*(3+1)=49*4 ⇒ x²=196 ⇒ x=14. So same result. Therefore, x is 14. Which is option D.

Wait, but let me confirm once more. Is angle at B 30 degrees? Yes. Right angle at A. So triangle ABC is right-angled at A, so angles at B and C sum to 90 degrees. With angle at B being 30, angle at C is 60. So yes, the hypotenuse BC is opposite the right angle, so BC is the hypotenuse. Therefore, using sine of angle B gives us the ratio of AC (opposite) over hypotenuse BC. So yes, that gives x=14. Hence, the answer should be D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, which represents the length of segment $ BC $, we begin by analyzing the given geometric constraints:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Triangle Configuration**

We are told:

- $ \text{Length}(AB) = y $
- $ \text{Length}(AC) = 7 $
- $ \text{Length}(BC) = x $
- $ \angle ABC = 30^\circ $
- $ \overline{AC} \perp \overline{AB} $

This implies that triangle $ \triangle ABC $ is a **right triangle** with the right angle at point $ A $. Thus, $ \angle CAB = 90^\circ $.

---

### **Step 2: Use Trigonometric Ratios**

Since $ \angle ABC = 30^\circ $, and the triangle is right-angled at $ A $, we can apply **trigonometry** to relate the known side lengths and angles.

In triangle $ ABC $:

- Side $ AC = 7 $ is **opposite** $ \angle ABC = 30^\circ $
- Hypotenuse $ BC = x $ is across from the right angle at $ A $
  
Using the **sine function**:

$$
\sin(\angle ABC) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{AC}{BC}
$$

Substitute values:

$$
\sin(30^\circ) = \frac{7}{x}
$$

Recall that:

$$
\sin(30^\circ) = \frac{1}{2}
$$

Therefore:

$$
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{7}{x} \Rightarrow x = 14
$$

---

### **Step 3: Final Verification via Pythagoras (Optional)**

As an alternative method, compute $ AB $ first using the tangent function:

$$
\tan(\angle ABC) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{AC}{AB} \Rightarrow \tan(30^\circ) = \frac{7}{y}
$$

$$
\tan(30^\circ) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \Rightarrow y = 7\sqrt{3}
$$

Now use the Pythagorean Theorem:

$$
x^2 = y^2 + 7^2 = (7\sqrt{3})^2 + 7^2 = 147 + 49 = 196 \Rightarrow x = \sqrt{196} = 14
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

Both methods lead to the conclusion that:

$$
x = 14
$$

Thus, the correct answer is:

$$
\boxed{D}
$$

**Final Answer: D**
