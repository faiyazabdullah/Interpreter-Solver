<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we need to find the measure of angle H, given all these geometric constraints. Let me start by listing out all the given information so I can visualize it better.

First, there are some angle measures given:

- Angle at point B between points K and F (Angle(K,B,F)) is 88 degrees.
- Angle at point B between points J and G (Angle(J,B,G)) is 26 degrees.

Then there are several PointLiesOnLine statements, which tell us about the positions of points relative to lines:

1. F lies on line AG.
2. G lies on line AH.
3. F also lies on line AH. Wait, that seems conflicting? If both G and F lie on line AH, then points F and G are both on line AH. But earlier, G was on line AH and also on line HG? Wait, no, let me check again.

Wait, the next ones:

4. J lies on line HK.
5. K lies on line HC.
6. J also lies on line HC. So J is on both HK and HC?
7. G lies on line HF. Wait, original statement says: PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(H, F))? No, wait the original list says:

PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(A, H)): so G is on line AH.

PointLiesOnLine(F, Line(A, H)): same as above, so F is on line AH. So both F and G are on line AH. Then, another constraint: PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(H, F)). Wait, that would mean G is on line HF. But since G is already on line AH, which includes points A, H, and F (since F is on AH). Therefore, line HF is part of line AH, so G being on HF implies it's on AH. So that's consistent.

Next, PointLiesOnLine(K, Line(J, C)): K is on line JC.

Also, there are circles involved:

Points G, K, F, J lie on a circle centered at B with radius 4.0. So, all four points G, K, F, J are on the circumference of a circle with center B.

So, first, maybe drawing a diagram would help. Since I can't draw here, I'll try to imagine or note down coordinates or relationships.

Let me think step by step.

Since points F, G, J, K are on the circle centered at B, so B is the center. That means BF = BG = BK = BJ = radius, which is 4 units. So triangle BFG, BJK, etc., are all isosceles triangles because two sides are radii.

Given angles at B:

Angle KBF is 88°, and angle JBG is 26°. Wait, let me confirm:

Angle(K, B, F) is the angle at B between points K and F. So that's ∠KBF = 88°, and ∠JBG = 26°, since it's angle at B between J and G.

Now, considering that points F, G, J, K are on the circle around B. So maybe quadrilateral FGJK is inscribed in the circle? Or perhaps some other configuration?

But since they are all on the same circle, they lie on a circle with center B. Wait, but usually, a circle has all points equidistant from the center. So if B is the center, then each of those points is 4 units away from B. So the circle is centered at B with radius 4. So BF = BG = BK = BJ = 4.

Now, looking at angles at B. For example, angle KBF is 88°, which is the central angle subtended by arc KF. Similarly, angle JBG is 26°, which is the central angle for arc JG.

But maybe there's something else here. Also, the points F and G are on line AH. So line AH contains points A, H, F, G. Wait, because F and G are on line AH. Also, point F is on line AH and line HF? Wait, earlier constraints said:

PointLiesOnLine(F, Line(A, H)) → F is on AH.

PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(A, H)) → G is on AH.

Therefore, points A, H, F, G are colinear. So line AH passes through points A, H, F, G. Wait, but order? Let me think. Points F and G are on AH. Depending on their positions, but without loss of generality, let's assume that H is somewhere along AH such that A---H---F---G or some permutation. But need to figure out relations.

Also, there are other lines mentioned:

PointLiesOnLine(J, Line(H, K)): J is on line HK.

PointLiesOnLine(K, Line(H, C)): K is on line HC.

PointLiesOnLine(J, Line(H, C)): J is on line HC. So J is on both HK and HC. Therefore, point J is the intersection of lines HK and HC. Wait, unless H, C, J are colinear? Because J is on line HC. And J is also on line HK, so line HK intersects HC at J. Therefore, line HK meets HC at J. So point J is on HC and HK.

Similarly, point K is on line HC and line JK (from previous), but also on line JC (as per PointLiesOnLine(K, Line(J, C))). So K is on line JC. Therefore, K is the intersection of lines JC and HC. So line JC connects J and C, and K is on that line. Also, since K is on HC, that suggests that point C is connected to H and K is somewhere on HC.

Additionally, point L? Wait, no, the points mentioned are A, B, C, F, G, H, J, K. Maybe there are more points, but not sure yet.

Now, trying to find angle H. Which angle? The question says "m∠H". Typically, angle at point H. So angle formed at point H by two lines meeting there. Which two lines? Well, based on the constraints, H is connected to A (line AH), and also connected to C via line HC (since K is on HC and J is on HC). Also, maybe other connections?

Wait, line HF is mentioned earlier. Since F is on AH and G is on AH, then line HF is part of AH. Also, point G is on line HF (from the constraint PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(H, F))), which makes sense because G is on AH, so line HF is part of AH. Therefore, line HF is just segment of AH.

So, putting together:

- Points A, H, F, G are colinear in some order.

- Lines involving H include AH, HC, HF, and possibly others like HK (since J is on HK).

Also, since J is on HC and HK, and K is on JC and HC, so line JC connects J and C, passing through K.

Moreover, points J and K are on the circle centered at B. So J and K are both on the circle around B, so BJ = BK = 4.

Also, angles at B: ∠KBF = 88°, ∠JBG = 26°.

Let me try to sketch mentally:

Imagine circle centered at B. Points F, G, J, K on the circle. So BF, BG, BJ, BK are radii. So triangle BKF has BF = BK, making it isosceles. Similarly, triangle BGJ is isosceles with BG = BJ.

Given ∠KBF = 88°, which is the angle between BK and BF. So if I consider triangle BKF, with BK=BF=4, and vertex angle at B of 88°, then the base angles at K and F would be equal. Similarly for triangle BGJ with angle at B of 26°, leading to base angles at J and G.

But how does this relate to the rest of the diagram?

Also, points F and G are on line AH. So line AH passes through points A, H, F, G. Let me assume that H is between A and F, or F and G. Not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe H is outside the circle? Since the circle is centered at B, and points F, G, J, K are on the circle. So H could be inside or outside. But since H is connected to points on line AH, which passes through F and G (which are on the circle), maybe H is outside the circle?

But need to find angle H, which is likely formed by lines connecting H to two other points. Given that H is connected to A (on line AH), and also connected to C via HC (since J and K are on HC). So angle at H might be between HA and HC, or between other lines.

But to determine which angle, need more info.

Alternatively, maybe angle H refers to ∠AHB or ∠CHB, depending on connections. However, since the problem states "m∠H", it's ambiguous, but in most cases, it refers to the angle at point H formed by two segments connected to H. Given the constraints, possible candidates are:

- Between HA and HC (since H is connected to A and C)

- Or between HA and HF (but HF is part of AH, so that would be straight line)

- Or between HC and some other line?

Alternatively, maybe angle between HF and HC? Or between other lines.

Wait, since J is on HC and HK, and K is on JC and HC. Also, line HK goes through J. So line HK passes through J, which is on HC. So line HK intersects HC at J. Therefore, lines HK and HC meet at J. Therefore, angle at H between lines HK and HC? Or maybe between HA and HC?

Alternatively, maybe angle H is referring to ∠H in some triangle involving H.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should focus on using the given angles and circle properties.

Since points F, G, J, K are on the circle centered at B, and we have angles at B. Let me recall that the central angle is twice the inscribed angle subtending the same arc. But here, since all points are on the circle, maybe we can use properties related to arcs.

For instance, angle KBF is 88°, which is a central angle, so the arc from K to F is 88°. Similarly, angle JBG is 26°, so arc from J to G is 26°.

But how do these arcs relate to the rest of the diagram?

Also, since points F and G are on line AH, meaning that line AH passes through two points on the circle. So line AH is a secant line intersecting the circle at F and G. Therefore, the power of point H with respect to the circle can be considered. However, I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Alternatively, since H lies on line AH, which intersects the circle at F and G. Therefore, H is outside the circle, and AF * AH = power of H with respect to the circle. Wait, but without knowing distances, maybe not helpful.

Another approach: Since angles at B are known, maybe we can find arcs and then find other angles.

Let me denote:

Arc KF corresponds to central angle 88°, so arc length is 88°.

Arc JG corresponds to central angle 26°, so arc length is 26°.

But how do these arcs relate to other arcs?

If I can find the position of points K, J, F, G on the circle, maybe I can find other arcs.

But need more information. Also, points J and K are on line JC and HC, which may connect to other parts.

Alternatively, considering triangles involving H.

Suppose we look at triangle HBF or similar.

Wait, but H is outside the circle, and F is on the circle. So HF is a tangent? Not necessarily. Unless there's a right angle. Not sure.

Alternatively, since F is on line AH, which passes through H and F, and F is on the circle. So if I consider triangle HBF, with BF being a radius, and HF being a line from H to F.

But without knowing lengths, hard to proceed.

Wait, but maybe using the Law of Sines or Cosines on triangles involving B.

For example, in triangle BKF, with BK = BF = 4, and angle at B of 88°, so we can compute the lengths of KF.

Law of Cosines: KF² = BK² + BF² - 2*BK*BF*cos(∠KBF)

Which is KF² = 4² + 4² - 2*4*4*cos(88°)

Calculating that:

KF² = 16 + 16 - 32 cos(88°)
= 32 - 32 cos(88°)
≈ 32(1 - cos(88°))

But I don't know if that helps yet.

Similarly, in triangle BGJ, angle at B is 26°, so similar calculation.

But how does this help with finding angle at H?

Alternatively, since points F and G are on line AH, and H is outside the circle, maybe we can use the fact that angles subtended by chords can relate to angles at H.

For example, the angle between two chords from H to points on the circle.

Wait, if H is outside the circle, and HF and HG are two secants, then the angle between them (∠FHG) is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs.

Specifically, ∠FHG = ½(arc FG - arc ... ? Wait, formula is:

The measure of an angle formed by two secants intersecting outside the circle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

In this case, if H is outside the circle and HF and HG are two secants intersecting at H, then ∠FHG = ½(arc FG - arc ... )? Wait, depends on which arcs. If the two secants intercept arcs FG and... well, if the two secants go from H through F and G to the circle, then the angle is ½( arc FG - arc ... ). Wait, actually, when two secants intersect outside the circle, the angle is ½( larger arc - smaller arc ).

But in our case, points F and G are on line AH, so the angle at H between HF and HG is zero because F and G are on the same line. Wait, that can't be. Wait, because if F and G are both on line AH, then HF and HG are along the same line, meaning angle FHG is zero? That contradicts unless F and G coincide, which they aren't. Therefore, my assumption that H is outside the circle must be wrong? Or maybe the line AH intersects the circle at F and G, but H is between A and F, so that line AH extends beyond H to reach F and G. Wait, maybe H is between A and F, so that F is further along the line from A through H to G. Or vice versa.

Wait, suppose line AH passes through H, and extends to points F and G. If H is between A and F, then extending beyond H to G. Wait, but then F and G are both on line AH. So if H is between A and F, then moving from A through H to F, and then continuing past F to G? Or maybe H is between F and G?

This is confusing. Let me think again.

Given that F and G are both on line AH. So line AH contains points A, H, F, G in some order. So possibilities:

Case 1: A --- H ---- F ---- G

Case 2: A ---- F ---- H ---- G

Case 3: A ---- F ---- G ---- H

Or other orders. Without specific info, but maybe we can deduce based on other constraints.

Also, since points F and G are on the circle centered at B, and line AH passes through them. So if H is outside the circle, then line AH passes through the circle at F and G. So if H is outside, then the line AH intersects the circle at F and G, with H outside. Therefore, the order would be A----F----G----H or H----F----G----A or similar, depending on direction.

But since F and G are both on the circle, then H is outside, so the line AH passes through the circle at F and G, with H outside. Thus, the order could be H-----F-----G-----A or A-----F-----G-----H, but not sure.

However, regardless of the order, the key thing is that H is outside the circle, and line AH intersects the circle at F and G. Therefore, applying the external angle theorem:

The measure of angle at H between HF and HG (which are along line AH) would be ½(arc FG - arc ... ), but since HF and HG are along the same line, the angle between them is zero. This suggests that my assumption that H is outside the circle is incorrect, or that the angle isn't between HF and HG. Hence, maybe H is inside the circle?

Wait, if H is inside the circle, then the line AH passes through two points F and G on the circle, and H is inside. In that case, the angle between HF and HG would be related to the arcs. Specifically, the angle at H would be half the sum of the arcs intercepted by the lines HF and HG. Wait, no—when two chords intersect inside a circle, the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs.

Wait, yes! If two chords intersect at H inside the circle, then the measure of the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. But in this case, if H is inside the circle, and line AH passes through F and G, which are points on the circle, then HF and HG are two segments from H to the circle. Wait, but if H is inside, then HF and HG are two chords from H to the circle. But since F and G are distinct points, the angle between HF and HG would be half the sum of the arcs FG and ... ?

Wait, no. When two chords intersect at a point inside the circle, say, chords FG and something else. Wait, but here we only have one chord FG. Hmm, maybe not applicable.

Alternatively, if H is inside the circle, and line AH passes through F and G, then HF and HG are two parts of the same line. So the angle between HF and HG is zero, which again suggests contradiction. Therefore, maybe H is neither inside nor outside? It must be on the circle? But then line AH would be tangent at F or G, but F and G are distinct points, so that's not possible.

Hmm, this is perplexing. Perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the line AH passes through both F and G. Wait, the constraints state that PointLiesOnLine(F, Line(A, H)) and PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(A, H)). So both F and G are on line AH. Therefore, line AH contains both F and G. So either H is between A and F/G, or F and G are on opposite sides of H.

Wait, but if H is on line AH, then it's on the line itself. So H could be anywhere on line AH. Suppose H is between A and F, then extending beyond H to G. Or H is between F and G, with A on one side and G on the other. Or H is beyond F, with A and G on one side.

But without knowing exact positions, it's tricky. However, given that points F and G are on the circle centered at B, and H is on line AH, which contains both F and G. Let me think about the circle and the line AH.

Assume that line AH is a secant line intersecting the circle at F and G. So H is either outside the circle (so that line AH passes through the circle at F and G), or inside (so that line AH passes through F and G with H inside). 

If H is outside, then the angle between HF and HG is zero, which is not useful. If H is inside, then the angle between HF and HG is undefined, as they are collinear. So there's a contradiction here, implying that my initial assumptions are missing something.

Wait, perhaps the line AH intersects the circle at F and G, but H is not on the line AH? No, the constraints say that F and G are on line AH, so H is on line AH. 

Wait, perhaps the line AH is not a secant but a tangent? But then it would touch the circle at one point, but F and G are two different points on the line AH, so that's impossible. Hence, there's a contradiction unless H is located such that line AH is a secant passing through F and G, and H is not between them. Wait, but if H is not between F and G, then the line AH would extend beyond H to reach F and G. For example, if H is to the left of F, and the line AH extends to the right through F and G. 

In this case, H is outside the circle, and line AH passes through the circle at F and G. So the angle at H between HF and HG would be zero, which again suggests that my understanding is flawed.

Wait, maybe angle H is not referring to the angle between HF and HG, but another angle. Let me revisit the question: Find m∠H. What is the angle at H? Since H is connected to multiple points, maybe it's part of a triangle or quadrilateral.

Looking back at the constraints, there's mention of point C. Points J and K are on line HC. Also, point J is on line HK, and point K is on line JC. Also, points J and K are on the circle centered at B.

Perhaps triangle HBC? Or triangle HJK? Or other triangles.

Alternatively, since we have angles at B, maybe relating to triangle BHJ or something.

Wait, let me try to consider the positions of points J and K. Both are on the circle centered at B, so BJ = BK = 4. Also, J is on line HK and HC, and K is on line JC and HC.

So, line HC passes through J and K. So points H, J, K, C are colinear? Wait, no. J is on HC and K is on HC, so H, J, K, C are colinear? Yes, because both J and K are on line HC. So line HC passes through H, J, K, and C.

Therefore, H is connected to C via line HC, and J and K are points on that line. So, for example, H----J----K----C or some permutation.

Also, J is on line HK. Wait, since J is on line HK and on line HC, then line HK intersects line HC at J. So line HK passes through J, which is on HC. Therefore, line HK starts at H, goes through J, and continues to K. But K is also on line HC, so K is on HC. Therefore, line HK is part of line HC, since both pass through H and J and K. Wait, no. Line HK starts at H and goes through J, and since K is on HC, then line HK is the same as line HC. Because if you have line HC containing points H, J, K, C, then line HK is part of line HC.

Therefore, line HK is the same as line HC. So point K is on line HC, and line HK is line HC. So this simplifies things.

So line HC contains points H, J, K, C. So the order is probably H----J----K----C, or some variation.

Now, considering this, let's try to reconstruct the diagram.

We have:

- Circle centered at B with radius 4, containing points F, G, J, K.

- Line AH contains points A, H, F, G (in some order).

- Line HC contains points H, J, K, C.

- Points J and K are on the circle.

- Angles at B: ∠KBF = 88°, ∠JBG = 26°.

Now, let's think about the positions of J and K on the circle.

Since J is on line HC, and K is also on line HC, and both are on the circle, so line HC intersects the circle at J and K.

Similarly, line AH intersects the circle at F and G.

So, lines AH and HC are two secants from point H, intersecting the circle at F, G and J, K respectively.

Now, if we consider the power of point H with respect to the circle, we have:

HF * HA = HJ * HK

Because for a point outside the circle, the product of the distances from the point to the intersection points equals for any secant.

But since H is outside, and line AH intersects the circle at F and G, then HF * HG = HJ * HK.

Wait, but need to clarify the notation. Power of a point H with respect to a circle is equal to HF * HG = HJ * HK.

Yes, because for any secant line passing through the circle, the product of the distances from H to each intersection point is constant.

So, HF * HG = HJ * HK.

But without knowing actual distances, maybe this relationship can help us later.

Now, focusing back on angles at B. We have ∠KBF = 88°, ∠JBG = 26°. These are central angles.

Let me consider the arcs they subtend. Arc FK corresponds to 88°, arc GJ corresponds to 26°.

Now, since points F and G are on line AH, and points J and K are on line HC, which is another line from H.

Maybe we can find the measure of arc FG and arc JK, and then relate them to angles at H.

Alternatively, since H is outside the circle, and we have two secants, HF and HG, and HJ and HK, we can use the external angle formula:

∠FHB = ½(arc FB - arc GB)? Wait, no. The angle between two secants from H is ½(difference of intercepted arcs).

Specifically, if two secants from H intersect the circle at F and G (for one secant) and at J and K (for another secant), then the angle between them would be ½(arc FK - arc GJ), or something like that. Wait, let me recall the exact formula.

When two secants intersect outside the circle, the measure of the angle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. So, if two secants from H intersect the circle at F and G, and at J and K, then the angle between the secants would be ½(arc FJ - arc GK) or something. Wait, actually, the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs that are opposite the angle.

Actually, the formula is: ∠H = ½(measure of arc FG - measure of arc JK), assuming that the two secants are HF and HK, intercepting arcs FG and JK. Wait, not sure. Let me check.

Actually, the angle formed by two secants intersecting outside the circle is equal to half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. So, if the two secants are HF and HK, then the angle at H is ½(arc FK - arc GJ). Wait, I need to get this right.

Let me refer to standard formula: If two secants intersect at a point H outside the circle, then the measure of the angle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

So, if one secant passes through F and G, and the other passes through J and K, then the angle at H is ½(arc FJ - arc GK). Wait, no, more accurately, it's ½(the measure of the arc that's farther from H minus the measure of the arc closer to H).

But to apply this, I need to identify which arcs are intercepted.

Assuming that the two secants are HF and HJ, but in our case, one secant is HF and HG (both on line AH), and the other is HJ and HK (both on line HC). Wait, but HJ is part of HC, so the second secant is HJ and HK (since K is on HC). Wait, but the two secants from H are line AH (passing through F and G) and line HC (passing through J and K). So the angle between lines AH and HC at point H is equal to ½(arc FG - arc JK). Is that correct?

Yes, if the two secants are AH (intersecting the circle at F and G) and HC (intersecting the circle at J and K), then the angle between them at H is ½(arc FG - arc JK). 

But we need to determine the arcs FG and JK.

From earlier, we know the central angles corresponding to arcs FK and GJ. Wait, earlier, we had ∠KBF = 88°, which is the central angle for arc from K to F. Similarly, ∠JBG = 26°, central angle for arc from J to G.

But how do these relate to arcs FG and JK?

Let me try to label the arcs.

Let me define the circle with center B, and points F, G, J, K on it. 

Arcs:

- Arc FK: 88°, since ∠KBF = 88°, which is the central angle between K and F.

- Arc GJ: 26°, since ∠JBG = 26°, central angle between J and G.

Now, need to find arc FG and arc JK.

To find arc FG, let's see. Arc FG can be computed as the sum or difference of other arcs.

But we need to figure out the arrangement of points F, G, J, K on the circle.

Assume that the points are placed in the order F, K, J, G around the circle? Or some other order. But without knowing the exact positions, it's challenging. Alternatively, maybe using the total circumference.

The total circumference of the circle is 360°. So the sum of all arcs should be 360°.

Let me attempt to express arcs in terms of known values.

From ∠KBF = 88°, which is arc from K to F: arc KF = 88°.

From ∠JBG = 26°, which is arc from J to G: arc JG = 26°.

But we need to relate these arcs to others.

Assuming that the points are arranged in such a way that the arcs can be added up.

Let me try to imagine the circle with points F, G, J, K. 

Assume that going clockwise from K to F is 88°, and from J to G is 26°. Let's try to find arc FG and arc JK.

But to do this, I need to establish the order of points around the circle.

Let me consider the positions of points F, G, J, K.

Since points F and G are on line AH, and J and K are on line HC, which is a different line. Assuming that lines AH and HC are not overlapping, so they form some angle at H.

But without knowing the exact diagram, it's complex. However, maybe we can find the arcs by considering the entire circle.

Let me attempt to write equations.

Let’s denote:

arc KF = 88° (given by central angle ∠KBF = 88°)

arc JG = 26° (given by central angle ∠JBG = 26°)

Let me denote other arcs:

arc FJ = x

arc GK = y

arc KJ = z

arc GF = w

Wait, but need to ensure that all arcs add up to 360°. However, this might be too vague.

Alternatively, consider that arc from F to K is 88°, and arc from J to G is 26°. To find arc FG and arc JK.

Let me think: If I can express arc FG in terms of arc KF and arc JG, but need to consider the overall arrangement.

Alternatively, consider that the full circle is composed of arcs between the points. Let me try to imagine the circle with points F, G, J, K.

Assume that the points are ordered as F, J, K, G around the circle. Then:

arc FJ + arc JK + arc KG + arc GF = 360°.

But we know arc KF = 88°, which would be arc from K to F, which is arc KJ + arc JF = arc KJ + arc FJ = 88°.

Similarly, arc JG = 26°, which is arc J to G, which would be arc JK + arc KG = 26°.

Wait, if the points are in order F, J, K, G around the circle, then:

arc FJ = arc from F to J

arc JK = arc from J to K

arc KG = arc from K to G

arc GF = arc from G to F

So, arc KF (from K to F) would be arc KJ + arc JF = arc JK + arc FJ = 88°.

And arc JG (from J to G) would be arc JK + arc KG = 26°.

So we have two equations:

1. arc JK + arc FJ = 88°

2. arc JK + arc KG = 26°

Let me call arc JK = a, arc FJ = b, arc KG = c.

So:

a + b = 88° ...(1)

a + c = 26° ...(2)

Subtracting (2) from (1):

b - c = 62° ...(3)

But we need more equations to solve for these variables. Let's consider the remaining arcs.

The arc from G to F would be arc GF = d.

Then, the total circumference is:

arc FJ + arc JK + arc KG + arc GF = b + a + c + d = 360°

But from equation (1): a + b = 88°, and from (2): a + c = 26°, so substituting into total:

(a + b) + (a + c) + d - a = 88 + 26 + d - a = 114 + d - a = 360 => d - a = 246° => d = a + 246°.

But since arc GF is d, and arc GF + arc FG = 360°? No, arc GF is part of the circle.

Wait, arc GF is the same as arc FG, but in the opposite direction. So arc FG = d.

But I need to relate this to other arcs. However, without additional information, it's difficult to proceed.

But remember that we're interested in arc FG, which is d. From above, d = a + 246°, but this seems problematic because arc measures cannot exceed 360°, and adding a positive value to 246° would make it larger than 360° unless a is negative, which it can't be. So this suggests that my assumption about the ordering of points is incorrect.

Alternative approach: Maybe the points are arranged differently. Let's assume that arc FG is what we need for the angle at H.

Earlier, we thought that the angle at H is ½(arc FG - arc JK). If that's the case, then we need to find arc FG and arc JK.

But how?

Alternatively, since we have arc KF = 88° and arc JG = 26°, perhaps we can find arc FK and arc GJ, and then combine them.

Wait, arc FK is 88°, arc GJ is 26°. If we can find the arc between F and G, and between J and K, then we can apply the formula.

But how?

Let me think: Imagine the circle with points F and G separated by arc FG, and points J and K separated by arc JK. The angle at H is ½(arc FG - arc JK). 

If I can find arc FG and arc JK, then I can calculate this angle.

But how to find these arcs?

Let me consider the full circle. The sum of all arcs is 360°. If I can express arc FG and arc JK in terms of known arcs.

From before, we have arc KF = 88° and arc JG = 26°. Let's try to relate these to arc FG and arc JK.

Consider that arc KF = arc from K to F, which is equal to arc KJ + arc JF = arc JK + arc FJ = 88°.

Similarly, arc JG = arc from J to G = arc JK + arc KG = 26°.

Let me denote arc JK = x, arc FJ = y, arc KG = z.

So:

x + y = 88° ...(1)

x + z = 26° ...(2)

Subtract (2) from (1): y - z = 62° ...(3)

Now, we need more equations. Let's consider the remaining arcs.

The arc from G to F is arc GF. Let's call this arc GF = w.

Then, the full circle is arc FJ + arc JK + arc KG + arc GF = y + x + z + w = 360°.

From (1) and (2), x + y = 88°, x + z = 26°. Adding these gives 2x + y + z = 114°.

But from the total circle: y + x + z + w = 360° ⇒ (y + z) + x + w = 360°.

From 2x + y + z = 114°, we can express y + z = 114° - 2x.

Substitute into total: (114° - 2x) + x + w = 360° ⇒ 114° - x + w = 360° ⇒ w = 360° - 114° + x = 246° + x.

But arc GF is w, and arc FG is the same as arc GF but in the opposite direction, so arc FG = w = 246° + x.

But this seems problematic because arc FG would be greater than 246°, which is possible, but we need to relate it to other parts.

Alternatively, maybe there's a relation between arc FG and arc JK.

Wait, if we consider that arc FG = arc from F to G, which can be expressed as arc FJ + arc JK + arc KG = y + x + z.

Wait, no, if the points are arranged as F -> J -> K -> G -> F, then arc FG would be arc FJ + arc JK + arc KG = y + x + z.

But from above, y + x + z = (from equations 1 and 2: x + y = 88°, x + z = 26°; adding gives 2x + y + z = 114°, so y + z = 114° - 2x. Thus, arc FG = y + x + z = 114° - x.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: If arc FG is passing through J and K, then it would be arc FJ + arc JK + arc KG = y + x + z. But from earlier, we have y + x + z = 114° - x + x? Wait, no, earlier we had y + x + z = (from y + x = 88° and x + z = 26°) adding gives y + x + z = 88° + 26° - x = 114° - x. So arc FG = 114° - x.

But we also have from earlier that arc GF = w = 246° + x. But arc GF and arc FG are supplementary if they are major and minor arcs, but since we're dealing with the circle, arc FG could be the minor or major arc. But since we're using the formula for the angle at H, which is ½(arc FG - arc JK), we need to know which arc is being referred to.

Assuming that arc FG is the arc that does not contain J and K, and arc JK is the arc between J and K.

But this is getting too abstract. Maybe there's another way.

Let me recall that the angle at H is formed by two secants: one passing through F and G (line AH), and the other passing through J and K (line HC). So the angle at H is ½(arc FG - arc JK). 

If we can find arc FG and arc JK, we can compute this angle.

We know arc KF = 88°, arc JG = 26°.

Let me try to express arc FG and arc JK in terms of these.

Let me consider the full circle. The total of all arcs is 360°.

Let me assume that the arcs between the points are as follows:

- arc FK = 88° (from F to K)

- arc JG = 26° (from J to G)

Let me try to find arc FG and arc JK.

If I consider the arcs between F, G, J, K, it's possible that arc FG + arc JK = arc FK + arc JG? Not sure.

Alternatively, think about the sum of arc FG and arc JK.

Let me imagine moving from F to G and from J to K. 

But this is still unclear. Let me try using the earlier equations.

From earlier:

arc KF = arc from K to F = 88° = arc KJ + arc JF = arc JK + arc FJ = x + y = 88°

arc JG = arc from J to G = 26° = arc JK + arc KG = x + z = 26°

And we had arc FG = y + x + z = 114° - x.

And arc JK = x.

So, if the angle at H is ½(arc FG - arc JK) = ½((114° - x) - x) = ½(114° - 2x) = 57° - x.

But we need to find x.

Is there another equation to find x?

Yes! The arc from G to F is arc GF = w = 246° + x (from earlier), and since arc GF + arc FG = 360°, if arc FG is the minor arc, then arc GF is the major arc. But arc GF = 246° + x, and arc FG = 114° - x. So:

arc GF + arc FG = 360°

=> (246° + x) + (114° - x) = 360°

=> 246° + x + 114° - x = 360°

=> 360° = 360°

Which checks out, but gives no new information.

So we need another relation. Maybe considering the positions of points J and K on the circle.

Wait, since points J and K are on line HC, and line HC passes through J and K, which are on the circle. So line HC is a secant intersecting the circle at J and K. Similarly, line AH intersects the circle at F and G.

Now, if we consider the power of point H with respect to the circle, we have:

HF * HG = HJ * HK.

Let me denote HF = a, HG = b, HJ = c, HK = d.

Then, a * b = c * d.

But without knowing the actual lengths, this might not help directly. However, if we can express these in terms of arcs or angles, maybe.

Alternatively, since we have central angles, maybe we can use trigonometry to relate the lengths.

For example, in triangle BFK, with BF = BK = 4, angle at B is 88°, so we can compute FK using the law of cosines:

FK² = BF² + BK² - 2 * BF * BK * cos(angle KBF)

= 4² + 4² - 2 * 4 * 4 * cos(88°)

= 32 - 32 cos(88°)

Similarly, for triangle BGJ, with BG = BJ = 4, angle at B is 26°, so GJ² = 4² + 4² - 2*4*4*cos(26°) = 32 - 32 cos(26°)

But how does this relate to HF, HG, HJ, HK?

Well, if H is outside the circle, then HF * HG = power of H = HB² - r², where r is the radius (4). Wait, but HB is the distance from H to B, and r = 4. So power of H is HB² - 16.

But we also have HF * HG = HJ * HK = power of H.

But unless we know HB, this might not help. However, maybe we can relate it to the angles.

Alternatively, since we have angles at B, maybe we can find the lengths of HF, HG, HJ, HK in terms of HB.

But this seems complicated.

Let me think differently. Let's assume that the angle at H is ½(arc FG - arc JK). Let's call this angle θ = ½(arc FG - arc JK). Our goal is to find θ.

But we need to find arc FG and arc JK.

From earlier, arc FG = 114° - x, and arc JK = x. So θ = ½(114° - x - x) = ½(114° - 2x) = 57° - x.

But we need to find x.

Is there a way to find x?

Let me think about the positions of points J and K on the circle. Since J and K are on line HC, and also on the circle, and line HC passes through H, J, K, C. So, if I can find the measure of arc JK, which is x, perhaps through other means.

Alternatively, since J and K are on the circle, and line JC passes through K (from the constraint PointLiesOnLine(K, Line(J, C))), and line HC passes through J and K.

But without knowing more about point C or other angles, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, but maybe we can relate arc JK to the angles at B.

Let me consider the central angle for arc JK. Let's say the central angle is α. Then arc JK = α.

Similarly, arc FG is β.

But from earlier, arc KF = 88°, which is arc from K to F, which is arc KJ + arc JF = α + arc JF = 88°.

Similarly, arc JG = 26°, which is arc JK + arc KG = α + arc KG = 26°.

Let me denote arc JF = γ and arc KG = δ.

So:

α + γ = 88° ...(1)

α + δ = 26° ...(2)

From (1) and (2), subtract (2) from (1): γ - δ = 62° ...(3)

Now, the total circle is:

arc FJ + arc JK + arc KG + arc GF = γ + α + δ + β = 360°

But β is arc FG, which is arc from F to G. Let's see, arc FG can be expressed as arc FJ + arc JK + arc KG = γ + α + δ.

Wait, if the points are arranged as F -> J -> K -> G -> F, then arc FG would be γ + α + δ.

Thus, β = γ + α + δ.

But from (1) and (2), γ = 88° - α, and δ = 26° - α.

Substituting into β:

β = (88° - α) + α + (26° - α) = 88° - α + α + 26° - α = 114° - α.

So, β = 114° - α.

Now, returning to the total circle:

γ + α + δ + β = (88° - α) + α + (26° - α) + (114° - α) = 88° - α + α + 26° - α + 114° - α = 88° + 26° + 114° - 2α = 228° - 2α = 360°

So:

228° - 2α = 360°

=> -2α = 132°

=> α = -66°

Wait, that's impossible, as arc measures cannot be negative. This suggests an error in my assumptions about the arrangement of points.

This indicates that my assumption about the order of points on the circle is incorrect. Probably, the arc FG is not γ + α + δ, but something else.

Let me reconsider the arrangement of points on the circle.

Maybe the points are arranged such that arc FG is not passing through J and K, but instead is a separate arc. Let me try another approach.

Let me consider that the arc from F to G is arc FG, and arc from J to K is arc JK. Let me try to find these arcs using the given central angles.

From ∠KBF = 88°, which is the central angle between K and F, so arc KF = 88°.

From ∠JBG = 26°, which is the central angle between J and G, so arc JG = 26°.

Now, let me try to find arc FG and arc JK.

If I can find the arc from F to G, it would be arc FG = arc FK + arc KJ + arc JG? No, that depends on the positions.

Wait, if arc KF is 88°, and arc JG is 26°, then depending on the positioning, arc FG could be arc KF + arc JG - arc something, but this is unclear.

Alternatively, imagine the circle with points F, G, J, K. Let me try to place them such that arc KF = 88° and arc JG = 26°, and see what arc FG and arc JK are.

Let me assume that the points are arranged in the order F, K, J, G around the circle. Then:

- arc FK = 88° (from F to K)

- arc KJ = x

- arc JG = 26° (from J to G)

- arc GF = y

Total circle: 88° + x + 26° + y = 360° => x + y = 246°.

Now, arc FG is the arc from F to G, which would be arc FK + arc KJ + arc JG = 88° + x + 26° = 114° + x.

But also, arc FG = y (the arc from G back to F). Wait, no. If the points are F -> K -> J -> G -> F, then arc FG is the arc from F to G passing through K and J, which is 88° + x + 26° = 114° + x. But the other arc from F to G is the shorter arc, which would be y. So, depending on whether it's the major or minor arc.

But since we're using the angle at H, which is formed by two secants, the angle would be ½( major arc FG - minor arc FG ). But without knowing which is which, it's hard to say.

But let's assume that the angle at H is ½( major arc FG - minor arc FG ). But we need to determine which arc is used.

Alternatively, since the angle at H is formed by two secants, it's always ½( larger arc - smaller arc ). So if arc FG is the larger arc, then the angle is ½(arc FG - arc FG'), where arc FG' is the smaller arc.

But how to find arc FG and arc FG'.

Let me assume that arc FG is the major arc, so its measure is 114° + x, and the minor arc FG is y. Then, the angle at H would be ½(114° + x - y).

But from earlier, x + y = 246°, so y = 246° - x.

Substituting into the angle expression:

θ = ½(114° + x - (246° - x)) = ½(114° + x - 246° + x) = ½(2x - 132°) = x - 66°.

But we need to find x.

How?

We also know that arc JK is x (from the assumed arrangement, arc KJ = x). But what is arc JK?

Arc JK is the arc from J to K, which in this arrangement is x. But we also know that arc JG is 26°, which is from J to G. So, if arc JG = 26°, and arc JK = x, then arc KG = 26° - x, assuming that the arc from J to G passes through K.

Wait, if points are F -> K -> J -> G -> F, then arc from J to G is arc J -> K -> G? No, arc JG would be direct from J to G, but in this arrangement, it's arc J -> K -> G? No, if the points are F -> K -> J -> G -> F, then the arc from J to G would be arc J to G directly, which is arc JG = 26°, which is given. But in this arrangement, arc JG would be arc from J to G passing through K? No, because in this arrangement, J is followed by G, so arc JG is direct.

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Let me try to use the previous expression for θ = x - 66°, and see if we can find x.

But how?

We also know that arc JK is x. What is the relationship between arc JK and other arcs?

If we can find another equation involving x, we can solve for it.

Let me think about the arc from K to J, which is x, and the arc from J to G, which is 26°. If these arcs are part of the circle, maybe there's a relation.

Alternatively, consider the arc from K to J, which is x, and the arc from F to K, which is 88°. If we can find the arc from F to J, it would be arc FK - arc KJ = 88° - x.

But arc FJ = 88° - x.

Now, if we consider the arc from F to J, which is 88° - x, and the arc from J to G is 26°, then the arc from F to G passing through J is (88° - x) + 26° = 114° - x, which is the same as before.

But how does this help?

Maybe we need to relate this to the power of point H.

Recall that HF * HG = HJ * HK.

Let me assume that H is outside the circle, so the power of H is positive.

Let me denote the distance from H to B as d, so power of H is d² - 16.

But HF * HG = d² - 16, and HJ * HK = d² - 16.

But without knowing d, this is not directly helpful. However, if we can express HF, HG, HJ, HK in terms of arcs, perhaps using the law of cosines or sines.

For example, in triangle BHF, if we know the angle at B, we can relate HF to BF and angle.

Wait, but angle at B is not directly known for HF. Wait, but if we can find the angle between BH and BF, or something like that.

Alternatively, since points F and G are on the circle, and H is outside, the lines HF and HG are secants. The angle between them is θ = ½(arc FG - arc JK), which we are trying to find.

But if we can find θ, then we can relate it to the given angles at B.

But this seems circular.

Wait, but we know the angles at B, which are related to the arcs KF and JG. Maybe there's a way to relate θ to these.

Let me try to summarize what we have:

- arc KF = 88°

- arc JG = 26°

- angle at H is θ = ½(arc FG - arc JK)

We need to find θ.

Let me try to find arc FG and arc JK.

Let me consider the entire circle:

arc KF + arc FG + arc GJ + arc JK = 360°

Wait, if the points are arranged as K -> F -> G -> J -> K, then:

arc KF = 88°

arc FG = ?

arc GJ = 26°

arc JK = ?

But this assumes a certain arrangement.

Let me try this:

arc KF = 88°

arc FG = x

arc GJ = 26°

arc JK = y

Total: 88 + x + 26 + y = 360 → x + y = 246°

Now, the angle at H is θ = ½(arc FG - arc JK) = ½(x - y).

But we need to find x - y.

From x + y = 246°, we can express x = 246° - y.

Substituting into θ: θ = ½(246° - y - y) = ½(246° - 2y) = 123° - y.

But we need another equation to find y.

What is y? arc JK = y.

But arc JK is the arc from J to K, which is also related to the central angle at B. Wait, if we can find the central angle corresponding to arc JK, which would be the angle at B between J and K, i.e., ∠JBK.

But we don't have this angle given. However, maybe we can find it using other information.

Let me think. We know angles at B: ∠KBF = 88° and ∠JBG = 26°. Let me try to find ∠JBK.

If I can find the angle between JB and KB, which is ∠JBK, then arc JK = ∠JBK.

But how to find ∠JBK?

Let me consider the positions of J and K on the circle. If I can find the relationship between ∠KBF, ∠JBG, and ∠JBK.

Let me imagine the circle with points F, G, J, K. Let me try to find the angle at B between J and K.

Let me assume that points F, G, J, K are arranged such that arc KF = 88°, arc JG = 26°, and arc JK = y, as above.

Let me consider the angles at B. 

∠KBF = 88° is the angle between BK and BF.

∠JBG = 26° is the angle between BJ and BG.

Let me try to find ∠JBK, which is the angle between BJ and BK.

To find this, let's consider the angles around point B.

If I can find the angles between the various radii.

Let me think of the circle with center B, and points F, G, J, K on it.

The angle between BF and BK is ∠FBK, which is arc FK = 88°.

The angle between BJ and BG is ∠JBG = 26°, which is arc JG = 26°.

Now, what is the angle between BJ and BK, which is ∠JBK?

To find this, let's consider the positions of J and K relative to F and G.

Let me assume that the points are arranged in the order F, K, J, G around the circle. Then, the angle between BJ and BK would depend on the arc from J to K.

But this is getting too vague. Let me try to use the fact that the total of all angles around point B is 360°.

Let me consider the angles at B:

- ∠KBF = 88° (between BK and BF)

- ∠JBG = 26° (between BJ and BG)

Other angles at B would be between other pairs of radii.

Let me try to find ∠JBK.

If I can express ∠JBK in terms of known angles.

Let me consider the full circle around B. The angles between the radii to F, G, J, K must add up to 360°.

Let me denote the following angles at B:

- ∠KBF = 88° (between BK and BF)

- ∠FBG = ? (between BF and BG)

- ∠GBJ = 26° (between BG and BJ)

- ∠JBK = ? (between BJ and BK)

Wait, this might not cover all angles, but let's try.

If we consider the angles between the radii:

Starting from BK, going to BF: 88°

From BF to BG: let's call this angle α

From BG to BJ: 26° (given)

From BJ to BK: let's call this angle β

So total: 88° + α + 26° + β = 360°

But also, α + β = 360° - 88° - 26° = 246°

Now, what is α and β?

α is the angle between BF and BG, which is the central angle for arc FG, which we called x earlier.

β is the angle between BJ and BK, which is the central angle for arc JK, which we called y.

So, α = x, β = y.

Thus, x + y = 246°, which matches our previous equation.

Now, we need to find y (arc JK = β = y), which is needed to find θ = 123° - y.

But how?

Let me think about other relationships. For example, if we can find x or y through other means.

Let me recall that the angle at H is θ = ½(x - y). But we also have x + y = 246°.

So, we have two equations:

1. x + y = 246°

2. θ = ½(x - y)

But we need a third equation to solve for x and y.

Let me think about the power of point H. If I can relate x and y to the power of H, but without knowing distances, it's challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a relationship between x and y through the positions of points J and K on line HC, and the given angles at B.

Wait, let's think about the angle at B between J and K, which is β = y.

But how is this related to other angles?

If I can find β in terms of other angles.

Let me consider the angles at B. We have ∠KBF = 88° and ∠JBG = 26°. Let me try to find the relationship between these and β.

Let me imagine the positions of points F, G, J, K around the circle. If I can find the angle between BJ and BK, which is β.

Let me consider the full circle around B. The angle between BK and BF is 88°, and the angle between BG and BJ is 26°. Let me try to find β = ∠JBK.

If I can express β in terms of these angles.

Let me assume that the points are arranged such that from BK, we rotate 88° to BF, then from BF to BG is α, then from BG to BJ is 26°, and from BJ back to BK is β.

But without knowing the exact positions, it's difficult. However, if we assume that the points are arranged such that the angles are in sequence, we might find β.

Alternatively, let me consider that the total rotation from BK to BK is 360°. Starting from BK, rotating 88° to BF, then rotating α to BG, then 26° to BJ, then β back to BK.

So, the total rotation is 88° + α + 26° + β = 360°, which gives α + β = 246°, as before.

But this doesn't give us β directly.

However, if we can find α, which is the angle between BF and BG, which is arc FG = x. And x is related to the angle at H.

But we also have θ = ½(x - y) = ½(x - (246° - x)) = ½(2x - 246°) = x - 123°.

But θ is the angle at H, which we need to find. If we can find x, we can find θ.

But how?

Let me recall that the angle at H is formed by two secants: one passing through F and G, and the other through J and K. This angle is θ = ½(arc FG - arc JK) = ½(x - y) = x - 123°, as above.

But we also know that the angle at H is formed by lines AH and HC. Let me think about the other angles in the diagram.

Wait, maybe there is a relationship between θ and the given angles at B.

Let me think: If I can find the angle between lines AH and HC at H, which is θ, and relate it to the angles at B.

But how?

Alternatively, let me consider that the lines AH and HC are secants, and the angle between them is θ. This angle is related to the arcs FG and JK.

But without additional information, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, but perhaps there is a way to use the given angles at B to find x or y.

Let me consider the angle between BF and BG, which is α = x. Let me try to find α.

If I can find α, then I can find y = 246° - x, and thus θ = x - 123°.

But how to find α?

Let me think about the positions of points F and G on line AH, and the angles at B.

Let me consider triangle BFG. Since BF and BG are radii of the circle, BF = BG = 4. The angle at B is α = x, and the angle at H is θ = ½(x - y) = x - 123°.

Wait, but this might not directly help.

Alternatively, let me consider the triangle BFG. Using the law of cosines, we can find FG.

FG² = BF² + BG² - 2 * BF * BG * cos(α) = 4² + 4² - 32 cos(α) = 32(1 - cos(α)).

But also, from the power of point H, we have HF * HG = power of H = HB² - 16.

But HF and HG are parts of line AH, which passes through F and G. Let me assume that H is outside the circle, so HF and HG are segments from H to F and H to G.

Let me denote HF = p, HG = q. Then, p * q = HB² - 16.

But without knowing HB, this is not directly usable.

However, if I can relate p and q to the length of FG.

Since F and G are on line AH, and H is outside the circle, the distance between F and G is |p - q|, assuming H is outside and the points are in the order H-F-G or H-G-F.

Wait, if H is outside the circle, and line AH passes through F and G, then the distance FG = |HF - HG| or HF + HG, depending on the position.

Assume that H is outside, and the line AH extends from H through F to G. So the order is H---F---G, and HF is the distance from H to F, and HG is the distance from H to G, which is HF + FG.

So, HG = HF + FG.

Then, the power of point H is HF * HG = HF * (HF + FG) = HF² + HF * FG = HB² - 16.

But without knowing HF or FG, this is still not helpful.

However, if I can relate FG to α, which is the angle at B.

From earlier, FG² = 32
