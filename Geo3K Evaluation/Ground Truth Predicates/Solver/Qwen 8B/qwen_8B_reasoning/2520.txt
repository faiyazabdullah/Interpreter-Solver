MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. Hmm, first I need to parse all the given information. Let me start by listing out everything that's provided.

So, we have several points mentioned: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. The constraints include:

- Length of line CA is 4.4 units.
- Length of line GE is 6.3 units.
- Length of line GH is 3.15 units.
- Point H lies on line EF.
- Point B lies on line CD.

Additionally, there are two perpendicularity conditions: AB is perpendicular to DC, and GH is perpendicular to FE. Also, triangles ACD and GEF are similar.

The question asks for the length of AB. The answer choices are A. 2.2, B. 3.6, C. 4.4, D. 6.3.

Alright, so since we're dealing with similar triangles, I should recall that corresponding angles are equal and sides are in proportion. Also, the fact that AB ⊥ DC and GH ⊥ FE might relate to right angles in these triangles, which could help set up proportions or ratios.

First, let's note down the given lengths:

CA = 4.4, GE = 6.3, GH = 3.15.

Since triangle ACD ~ triangle GEF, their corresponding sides are proportional. But I need to figure out which sides correspond. Let me think about the order of the similarity statement: △ACD ∼ △GEF. That means angle A corresponds to angle G, angle C corresponds to angle E, and angle D corresponds to angle F. Therefore, side AC corresponds to GE, CD corresponds to EF, and AD corresponds to GF.

Wait, but maybe I should check the correspondence again. In triangle similarity notation, the order matters. So vertex A corresponds to G, C corresponds to E, D corresponds to F. Therefore, sides AC corresponds to GE, CD corresponds to EF, and AD corresponds to GF.

But let me confirm that. Since the similarity is △ACD ~ △GEF, then the correspondence is A→G, C→E, D→F. Hence:

AC / GE = CD / EF = AD / GF.

Given that, and knowing some of these lengths. We know AC = 4.4 and GE = 6.3, so the ratio of similarity between the two triangles would be AC/GE = 4.4 / 6.3. Let me compute that ratio. 

First, simplify 4.4 divided by 6.3. Let me convert them into fractions. 4.4 is 44/10, and 6.3 is 63/10. So dividing those gives (44/10)/(63/10) = 44/63. Simplifying further, divide numerator and denominator by 11? Wait, 44 ÷ 11 is 4, 63 ÷ 11 isn't integer. Alternatively, maybe reduce by GCD of 44 and 63. Factors of 44: 2×2×11; factors of 63: 3×3×7. No common factors except 1, so ratio is 44/63. Which simplifies to approximately... Well, 44 divided by 63 is roughly 0.698...

But perhaps it's better to keep it as a fraction for exactness.

Now, since the triangles are similar, the ratio of all corresponding sides is the same. So if I can find another pair of sides, I can set up equations.

However, we also have some other information. For instance, GH is 3.15, and GH is part of triangle GEF. Wait, GH is a segment from G to H, and point H lies on line EF. So GH is a segment from G to a point on EF. Maybe GH is related to another side?

Alternatively, since GH is perpendicular to FE. Given that GH ⊥ FE, and in triangle GEF, FE is one of the sides. So GH is an altitude? Or maybe not necessarily an altitude unless H is the foot of the perpendicular from G to FE. However, since H lies on FE, GH is perpendicular to FE, meaning GH is the height from G to FE in triangle GEF.

Similarly, AB is perpendicular to DC. Since AB is a segment from A to B, and B lies on CD. So AB is perpendicular to DC, implying that AB is the height from A to DC in triangle ADC?

Wait, but triangle ACD has base CD and height AB? Not sure yet. Let me think.

Let me try to visualize or sketch the diagram mentally. Points A, C, D form triangle ACD. Point B is somewhere on CD because PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(C, D)). And AB is perpendicular to DC. So AB is like a vertical segment (if DC is horizontal) from A to B on CD. So AB is the height of triangle ACD relative to base CD.

Similarly, in triangle GEF, GH is perpendicular to FE, with H lying on FE. So GH is the height of triangle GEF relative to base FE.

Since the triangles are similar, their heights should be in the same ratio as their corresponding sides.

Therefore, if I can find the ratio between the heights AB and GH, that should be equal to the ratio of similarity between the triangles.

Wait, but how do I relate AB to GH?

Let me formalize this.

Let’s denote the ratio of similarity between △ACD and △GEF as k. Then, each side of △ACD is k times the corresponding side of △GEF.

We already have AC corresponds to GE, so AC = k * GE => k = AC / GE = 4.4 / 6.3 = 44/63 ≈ 0.698...

Now, considering the heights. In triangle ACD, the height corresponding to base CD is AB. In triangle GEF, the height corresponding to base FE is GH. Because GH is perpendicular to FE, so GH is the height of triangle GEF with respect to base FE.

Thus, the ratio of the heights should also be k. Therefore, AB / GH = k = AC / GE = 44/63.

So AB = GH * (AC / GE).

We know GH is 3.15. Let me compute that.

AB = 3.15 * (4.4 / 6.3). Let me calculate that value.

First, compute 4.4 / 6.3. As before, 4.4 divided by 6.3 equals (44/10) / (63/10) = 44/63. Let me compute 44 divided by 63. Let me see:

Well, 44 ÷ 63 = approx 0.698...

But let me compute 3.15 multiplied by 44/63.

Note that 3.15 is equal to 63/20. Wait, 63 divided by 20 is 3.15. Yes, because 63 ÷ 20 = 3.15. So substituting:

AB = (63/20) * (44/63) = 44/20 = 2.2.

Ah! So AB is 2.2. Looking at the answer choices, option A is 2.2. Therefore, the answer should be A.

Wait, let me verify that again. Let me recheck the steps.

Because GH is the height of triangle GEF with respect to FE, and AB is the height of triangle ACD with respect to CD. Since the triangles are similar, their heights should be in the same ratio as their corresponding sides.

So AB / GH = AC / GE. Therefore, AB = GH * (AC / GE). Plugging numbers:

GH = 3.15, AC = 4.4, GE = 6.3.

Compute 4.4 / 6.3 = (4.4 * 10)/ (6.3 * 10) = 44/63. Multiply that by GH (3.15):

3.15 * 44 / 63.

But 3.15 is 63/20, as 63 divided by 20 is indeed 3.15. So:

(63/20) * (44/63) = 44/20 = 2.2. Exactly. So AB = 2.2. Which is option A.

Therefore, the correct answer is A.

I need to make sure there are no errors in my reasoning. Let me cross-validate.

Another way: Since the ratio of similarity is 44/63, then all linear measurements in triangle ACD are 44/63 times those in triangle GEF. Therefore, the heights (AB and GH) would also follow this ratio. Thus, AB = GH * (44/63). Which gives AB = 3.15*(44/63). As above, 3.15 is 63/20, so multiplying by 44/63 cancels out the 63, leaving 44/20 = 2.2. Correct.

Yes, that seems solid. So the answer is A. 2.2.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the length of $ AB $, we begin by analyzing the given geometric constraints and applying principles of triangle similarity and perpendicular relationships.

### **Step 1: Understand Triangle Similarity**

We are told that:
$$
\triangle ACD \sim \triangle GEF
$$
This implies that the corresponding angles are congruent and the sides are in proportion. From the order of vertices in the similarity statement, we identify the corresponding parts as follows:

- $ AC \leftrightarrow GE $
- $ CD \leftrightarrow EF $
- $ AD \leftrightarrow GF $

Hence, the ratio of similarity between the triangles is:
$$
\frac{AC}{GE} = \frac{CD}{EF} = \frac{AD}{GF}
$$

From the given data:
- $ AC = 4.4 $
- $ GE = 6.3 $

So the similarity ratio is:
$$
\frac{AC}{GE} = \frac{4.4}{6.3}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Use Perpendicular Relationships**

We are also told:
- $ AB \perp DC $
- $ GH \perp FE $

These imply that:
- $ AB $ is the **height** of triangle $ \triangle ACD $ with respect to base $ CD $
- $ GH $ is the **height** of triangle $ \triangle GEF $ with respect to base $ FE $

Because the triangles are similar, the ratio of their heights must be equal to the similarity ratio:
$$
\frac{AB}{GH} = \frac{AC}{GE}
$$

Substitute known values:
$$
\frac{AB}{GH} = \frac{4.4}{6.3}
$$

Multiply both sides by $ GH = 3.15 $ to isolate $ AB $:
$$
AB = GH \cdot \left(\frac{4.4}{6.3}\right)
$$

---

### **Step 3: Perform the Calculation**

$$
AB = 3.15 \times \left(\frac{4.4}{6.3}\right)
$$

Note that:
$$
\frac{4.4}{6.3} = \frac{44}{63}, \quad \text{and } 3.15 = \frac{63}{20}
$$

So:
$$
AB = \frac{63}{20} \cdot \frac{44}{63} = \frac{44}{20} = 2.2
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

After verifying the logic and performing the computation, we find that the length of $ AB $ is:
$$
\boxed{2.2}
$$

Final Answer: A  
$$
\boxed{\text{A}}
$$
