MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given information and figure out how the different points and lines relate to each other. The question is about finding the measure of arc HJ in circle M, given some other arcs and lengths. Let me start by listing out all the given constraints.

So, we have several points mentioned: L, K, G, F, N, H, J, M, P. And there are various conditions:

- Point L lies on two lines: Line(M, K) and Line(G, F). So L is the intersection point of these two lines.
- Similarly, N lies on Line(H, J) and Line(M, P).
- Points P, H, G, J, K, F lie on Circle M with radius 2.0. Wait, the radius is given as 2.0? That seems small for some of the lengths mentioned later, like FL=24 and HJ=48. Maybe that's okay because maybe those are chords or something else?

Also, there are perpendicularity conditions: Line LG is perpendicular to Line LK, and Line NP is perpendicular to Line NJ. Hmm. Also, the angles given are m∠H P = 65 degrees? Wait, no, the question says m∠HP? Or wait, it says m widehat HP, which I think refers to the measure of arc HP. Wait, but the problem states "m ∠H P = 65". Wait, maybe that's a typo? Because usually, angle notation would be with a vertex in the middle, like ∠HPM or something. But since they mention m widehat HP, which is arc HP. Wait, the original question says:

"In ⊙ M, FL = 24, HJ = 48, and m ∠ H P = 65. Find m ∠ H J."

Wait, maybe the user made a formatting error. Let me check again. The original question says:

"Find m ∠ H J." But in the problem statement, they wrote "m ∠ H P = 65", so perhaps it's supposed to be m arc HP = 65 degrees? Since arc measures are denoted with the hat symbol. So probably, the problem is referring to arc measures. So maybe the given is that arc HP has measure 65 degrees, and we need to find arc HJ.

But first, let me make sure. The problem mentions "m ∠ H P = 65"—if it were an angle, then it might be angle at P between H and another point, but without more context, it's ambiguous. However, since all the points are on circle M, and the rest of the problem involves arcs, I think it's safe to assume that m widehat HP (arc HP) is 65 degrees. So the given is that arc HP is 65°, and we need to find arc HJ.

Now, moving forward. Let me sketch mentally the diagram based on the given constraints.

First, circle M with radius 2.0. Points P, H, G, J, K, F are on this circle. So those six points are on the circumference of circle M. Then, points L and N are inside the circle? Because they lie on lines connecting points on the circle. For example, L is on line MK and line GF. So L is the intersection of lines MK and GF. Similarly, N is on lines HJ and MP. 

Additionally, there are perpendicularity conditions: Line LG is perpendicular to Line LK. So triangle GLK is right-angled at L? Wait, because if two lines through L are perpendicular, then yes. Similarly, Line NP is perpendicular to Line NJ, meaning that at point N, lines NP and NJ are perpendicular, so triangle PNJ is right-angled at N.

Also, FL = 24, HJ = 48. These are lengths. Since F and L are points, FL is the distance between them. Similarly, HJ is the length between H and J.

Given that all these points are related via the circle and lines, maybe we can use properties of circles, power of a point, chord lengths, inscribed angles, etc.

Let me start by considering the positions of the points. Let me note that points P, H, G, J, K, F are on circle M. Let me list their positions:

Since P is connected to M and N via line MP (since N is on line MP). Also, H is on circle M, same with J. Also, G and F are on circle M. Also, K and F are on circle M.

Moreover, FL = 24. Since F is on the circle, and L is a point such that FL is a segment from F to L. But L is on lines MK and GF. So maybe FL is a chord or a secant?

Similarly, HJ = 48. H and J are both on the circle, so HJ is a chord of the circle.

Wait, but the circle has radius 2.0. So diameter is 4.0. Therefore, the maximum possible chord length is 4.0. But here, HJ is given as 48, which is way larger than the diameter. This suggests that HJ isn't a chord of the circle. Wait, that can't be. Unless HJ is not a chord but something else. Wait, but H and J are points on the circle. If they are distinct points on the circle, then HJ is a chord. But if the circle has radius 2, then the maximum chord length is 4. So 48 is impossible unless there's some misunderstanding.

This inconsistency suggests that perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Wait, maybe FL and HJ refer to something else. Wait, maybe FL is not a straight line segment but something else? No, FL should be a straight line segment between points F and L. Alternatively, maybe the numbers are scaled? Like, maybe the radius is 2 units, but the actual lengths are scaled up by some factor?

Alternatively, perhaps the given FL = 24 and HJ = 48 refer to the lengths of certain segments, not directly the chord lengths. But how?

Wait, let me re-examine the problem statement. It says "In ⊙ M, FL = 24, HJ = 48..." So FL and HJ are lengths of segments. Given that F and L are points—F is on the circle, L is inside the circle (since it's on lines connecting points on the circle). Therefore, FL is a segment from F (on the circle) to L (inside the circle). Similarly, HJ is a segment from H (on the circle) to J (on the circle)? Wait, but H and J are both on the circle, so HJ would be a chord. But as before, with radius 2, the maximum chord length is 4. But HJ is given as 48, which contradicts that. Therefore, there must be a misinterpretation here.

Wait, hold on. Maybe FL is not the straight-line distance between F and L, but something else? For example, maybe FL is the length of a tangent or something? But L is inside the circle, so the tangent from L would be... Well, the tangent from a point inside the circle doesn't exist. So that's not possible. Alternatively, could FL be the length along a line? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the radius is not 2.0, but the radius is 2.0 times some scaling factor? Wait, the problem says "radius_2_0"—maybe that's a typo and meant to be radius 2.0? But even so, the chord lengths can't be 48. There's a contradiction here. So perhaps there's a mistake in interpreting the problem.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: the points P, H, G, J, K, F lie on Circle(M, radius_2_0). So radius is 2.0. So the circle has radius 2.0. Then, FL = 24 and HJ = 48. How can that be?

Wait, unless FL and HJ are not chord lengths but something else. Wait, maybe FL is the length of a line segment from F to L, where L is outside the circle? But earlier, we thought L was inside the circle. Wait, but according to the constraints: PointLiesOnLine(L, Line(M, K)) and PointLiesOnLine(L, Line(G, F)). So L is the intersection of lines MK and GF. Depending on the configuration, L could be inside or outside the circle. If the lines MK and GF intersect inside the circle, then L is inside; otherwise, outside. But given that FL is 24, which is much longer than the diameter of the circle (which is 4), that suggests that L is outside the circle. Wait, but then FL would be the distance from F (on the circle) to L (outside), which could be large. Similarly, HJ is 48, but H and J are both on the circle, so if HJ is a chord, it's max 4. But if HJ is the distance from H to J through some path, but that still doesn't make sense.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me check again. The problem says:

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS:
...
PointLiesOnCircle(P, Circle(M, radius_2_0))
PointLiesOnCircle(H, Circle(M, radius_2_0))
PointLiesOnCircle(G, Circle(M, radius_2_0))
PointLiesOnCircle(J, Circle(M, radius_2_0))
PointLiesOnCircle(K, Circle(M, radius_2_0))
PointLiesOnCircle(F, Circle(M, radius_2_0))"

So all these points P, H, G, J, K, F are on the circle centered at M with radius 2.0. So radius is 2.0. Now, FL = 24. So F is on the circle, L is somewhere, and the distance between F and L is 24. Similarly, HJ = 48. H and J are both on the circle, so the distance between them is 48. But since the circle has radius 2.0, the maximum possible distance between two points on the circle is the diameter, which is 4.0. Therefore, HJ cannot be 48. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, I must have misunderstood something.

Wait, maybe FL and HJ are not Euclidean distances but something else? Like, maybe FL is the length of the arc from F to L? But L is not necessarily on the circle. Or maybe FL is the number of units along the circle? But that also doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the radius_2_0 is actually radius 20? Like a typo in formatting? If the radius is 20, then the diameter is 40, and HJ = 48 would be longer than the diameter, which is possible if HJ is a chord extended beyond the circle? But H and J are on the circle. Wait, no—if H and J are on the circle, then the maximum distance between them is the diameter. So if the radius is 20, then the diameter is 40, so HJ=48 would be longer than the diameter, which is impossible. Hence, that's also not working.

Alternatively, maybe the numbers are not in the same unit system? Like, FL = 24 cm and HJ = 48 cm, while the radius is 2.0 meters? That seems arbitrary.

Wait, perhaps there's a misread in the problem. Let me check again. The problem says:

"In ⊙ M, FL = 24, HJ = 48, and m ∠ H P = 65. Find m ∠ H J."

Wait, maybe the problem is using FL and HJ as arc lengths instead of chord lengths? For example, FL being an arc from F to L? But L is not on the circle. Alternatively, maybe FL is a secant segment? But again, L is not on the circle.

Alternatively, maybe FL and HJ are the lengths of tangents from L and J to the circle? Wait, but FL would be the tangent from F to L? No, F is on the circle, so the tangent from F is just the tangent line at F. But FL is a segment from F to L, which is not necessarily a tangent.

Wait, maybe FL is the length of the tangent from L to the circle? Since L is inside the circle, the tangent length would be zero, because L is inside. So that can't be.

Hmm. This is perplexing. Let me consider that maybe the radius is not 2.0, but 20? Suppose there was a formatting issue where the radius was written as radius_2_0, meaning radius 20. Then, diameter is 40, and HJ = 48 would be possible if HJ is a chord longer than the diameter, but that's impossible. Wait, no, chords can't be longer than the diameter. So even with radius 20, HJ=48 would imply that the chord length is 48, which would require the central angle θ satisfying chord length = 2r sin(θ/2). So for r=20, chord length c = 48 = 2*20*sin(θ/2) => sin(θ/2)=48/(40)=1.2, which is impossible. So that's not possible either.

Wait, unless HJ is not a chord but something else. Wait, maybe HJ is the length of the segment from H to J passing through the center? But that would be the diameter. If the diameter is 40 (for radius 20), then HJ=48 would still be longer. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe FL and HJ are not chord lengths but the lengths of the lines from F to L and H to J, where L and J are points outside the circle? But then, how do we know where they are?

Wait, let me go back to the constraints. We have points L and N lying on specific lines. For instance, L is on lines MK and GF. So depending on the position of these lines, L could be inside or outside the circle. If lines MK and GF intersect outside the circle, then L is outside. In that case, FL would be a segment from F (on the circle) to L (outside), which could be long. Similarly, HJ is given as 48, but H and J are both on the circle, so HJ is a chord. But if the circle has radius 2.0, then chord length can't be 48. So this suggests that there's a fundamental inconsistency in the problem's data unless there's a misunderstanding.

Alternatively, maybe the radius is 2.0, but FL and HJ are not straight line distances but something else. Wait, could FL be the length of the arc from F to L? But L is not on the circle. Or maybe FL is the length of the arc from F to some other point? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses FL and HJ as labels for arcs, not lengths? But the problem says FL = 24, which would be numerical value, not an arc label.

Wait, maybe there's confusion between arc length and chord length. For example, if FL is the arc length from F to L, but L is not on the circle. Still unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the numbers are in different units. Suppose the radius is 2.0 units, and FL is 24 units, HJ is 48 units, but the problem is in a non-Euclidean geometry? Unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the circle has a radius of 2.0, but FL and HJ are not direct measurements but related to power of a point? Let's explore that.

Power of a point L with respect to circle M is equal to LF * LA, where LA is the length from L to the second intersection point of line LF with the circle. But since F is on the circle, LF is just the length from L to F, and if line LF intersects the circle only at F, then the power would be LF^2. Wait, if L is outside the circle, then power of L is LF^2 = LT^2 where LT is the tangent length. If L is inside, power is negative, equal to -(distance from L to center)^2 + r^2.

But given that FL = 24, and assuming that L is outside the circle, then the power of point L with respect to circle M is LF^2 = 24^2 = 576. Also, since L lies on line MK, which passes through M (since K is on the circle). So line MK connects M to K, which is on the circle. So if L is on line MK, then the power of L with respect to the circle is LM * LK = LF^2. Because line MK passes through M and K, so the power is LM * LK. Therefore, we can write:

LM * LK = LF² = 576.

Similarly, since L is also on line GF, which connects G and F. So line GF passes through L. Thus, power of L with respect to circle M is also LG * LF = LF²? Wait, no. Power of a point L with respect to circle M is equal to the product of the lengths from L to the points of intersection with any line through L. Since line GF passes through L and intersects the circle at G and F. So power of L is LG * LF = LF²? Wait, if F is one intersection point, and G is another, then it's LG * LF. Wait, but if F is on the circle, then one of the intersections is F, and the other is G. So power of L is LG * LF = LF * LG. Wait, but if L is outside the circle, then power is positive, and equals LF * LG. But since F is on the circle, then LF is the length from L to F, and LG is the length from L to G. However, if the line passes through G and F, then depending on the position of L, LG and LF could be in opposite directions. Wait, suppose L is outside the circle, and line GF passes through L, so L-G-F or L-F-G. So if L is outside, then one of the points (say, G) is between L and F, or vice versa. So if G and F are both on the circle, then depending on where L is, the product LG * LF would be equal to the power of L.

But since we don't know the exact positions, maybe we can set up equations. Similarly for point N.

But this seems complicated. Let me see if we can get any relations from here.

Let me denote the power of point L with respect to circle M as follows:

Since L is on line MK, which goes through M (center of the circle) and K (a point on the circle). So line MK starts at M, goes through K, and extends to L. So the power of L is LM * LK. Also, since L is on line GF, which connects G and F, both on the circle. So the power of L is LG * LF. Therefore, we have:

LM * LK = LG * LF.

Similarly, for point N, which is on line HJ and line MP. So similar reasoning applies. The power of N with respect to circle M is NH * NJ (since N is on line HJ) and also NM * NP (since N is on line MP). So:

NH * NJ = NM * NP.

But I'm not sure yet how this helps us, especially since we don't know the exact positions. However, we also have the perpendicularity conditions: LG ⊥ LK and NP ⊥ NJ.

These perpendicularity conditions suggest that triangles GLK and PNJ are right-angled at L and N respectively. So, for triangle GLK, right-angled at L, so by Pythagoras:

LG² + LK² = GK².

But GK is a chord of the circle. Since G and K are both on the circle centered at M with radius 2.0, so the distance between G and K is GK = 2r sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle between G and K. However, we don't know θ yet.

But we also have that LM * LK = LG * LF (from power of a point). Let me denote some variables to simplify.

Let me define variables:

Let’s say for point L:

Let’s denote LM = x, then since L is on line MK, which goes through M and K. Assuming L is outside the circle, then MK is extended beyond K to L, so LM = MK + KL. Wait, but without knowing the exact location, it's hard. Alternatively, if L is inside the circle, then LM would be less than the radius. But since FL = 24, which is very large compared to the radius 2.0, likely L is outside the circle. Therefore, LM * LK = LF² = 24² = 576.

Similarly, for point N, which is on line HJ and line MP. So similarly, power of N gives NH * NJ = NM * NP.

But we also have that NP ⊥ NJ. So triangle PNJ is right-angled at N. So PN² + NJ² = PJ². But PJ is a chord of the circle. Again, without knowing angles, it's tricky.

However, the key thing is that we are given arc HP = 65 degrees. Wait, arc HP? If H and P are points on the circle, then arc HP is the measure between H and P along the circumference. And we're told that this arc measure is 65 degrees. Need to find arc HJ.

So maybe we can relate the arcs using the given perpendicularity conditions and other properties.

Let me recall that in a circle, the measure of an arc corresponds to the central angle subtending it. Also, inscribed angles are half the measure of their subtended arcs.

Also, if two chords are perpendicular, certain relationships might hold.

Wait, for example, if two chords intersect at a point inside the circle, then the products of their segments are equal. But here, the perpendicularity condition may indicate something about the angles between the chords.

Alternatively, since LG ⊥ LK, and L is outside the circle, maybe there's a relation between the angles formed by the tangents?

Wait, if two lines from a point outside the circle are perpendicular, and they form a right angle, then maybe there's a relationship involving the angles between the lines to the center.

Alternatively, maybe the fact that LG ⊥ LK implies that the angles between LG and LK is 90 degrees, which might relate to the angles between the respective chords.

But this is getting too vague. Let me try to approach systematically.

First, since arc HP = 65 degrees, let's find its corresponding central angle ∠HMP = 65 degrees (assuming M is the center).

Then, we need to find arc HJ. To find arc HJ, we might need to find the central angle ∠H MJ.

If we can find the measure of ∠H MJ, that will give us the arc measure.

To find ∠H MJ, we might need to relate it to other known angles or arcs.

Looking at the given perpendicularity conditions: Line LG ⊥ Line LK, and Line NP ⊥ Line NJ.

Let me focus on the first condition: Line LG ⊥ Line LK. Since L is outside the circle, and lines LG and LK are two lines from L to points G and K on the circle. Their perpendicularity suggests that the angles between these lines is 90 degrees. Perhaps this relates to the angles subtended by the arcs GK or something else.

Alternatively, since LG and LK are tangents? No, because L is outside the circle, but G and K are points on the circle. Wait, if LG and LK are tangents, then they would be equal in length. But we are told they are perpendicular. However, we don't know if LG and LK are tangents. They are just secants from L to the circle, intersecting at G and K.

Wait, but if two secants from a point outside the circle are perpendicular, is there a property about the angles between them?

Yes! There's a theorem that says that if two secants from a point outside the circle are perpendicular, then the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs is 180 degrees. Wait, not sure. Let me recall: when two secants intersect outside the circle, the angle between them is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. So if two secants from L intersect the circle at G and K, and at another pair of points, then the angle between the secants is (arc GK - arc something)/2. But in our case, since there are only two points G and K on one secant, and maybe others?

Wait, for example, if you have two secants from L: one passing through G and F (since L is on line GF), and another passing through K and ...? Wait, L is on line MK, so the other secant is from L through M to K. Wait, but M is the center of the circle, so line MK is a radius extended to K. So the two secants from L are: one is line LF (passing through G and F), and the other is line LK (passing through M and K). Wait, but the angle between LG and LK is 90 degrees. So applying the external angle formula:

The angle between two secants from L is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs.

So, angle GLK = ½ ( arc GK - arc something ). Wait, the angle formed by two secants from L would be ½ (measure of the intercepted arc farther from L minus the nearer arc). 

Wait, specifically, if two secants from L intercept arcs AB and CD, then the angle is ½ ( arc AC - arc BD ) or something like that. Wait, let me recall the exact formula.

When two secants intersect outside the circle, the measure of the angle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. Specifically, if two secants from point L pass through the circle, intersecting it at G and F (one secant) and at K and another point (the other secant), then the angle at L is ½ ( arc GK - arc GF ). Wait, no, it depends on which arcs are intercepted.

Actually, the formula is: the measure of the angle formed by two secants intersecting outside the circle is equal to half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

In our case, the angle at L between secants LG and LK. The intercepted arcs would be the arcs between the points where the secants meet the circle. One secant is line LGF (passes through G and F), and the other is line LKM (passes through K and M?). Wait, but M is the center, not necessarily on the circle. Wait, M is the center, so K is on the circle, and M is inside the circle. So line LKM passes through L, then M (center), then K.

Thus, the two secants from L are:

1. Line LGF: intersects the circle at G and F.
2. Line LKM: intersects the circle at K (since M is inside the circle, and extending line LKM past M reaches K).

Therefore, the angle between these two secants at L is ½ ( arc FK - arc GK ), assuming that arc FK and arc GK are the intercepted arcs.

Wait, but I need to visualize this. The angle at L is formed by secant LGF and secant LKM. The intercepted arcs would be the arcs that are "farther" and "nearer". So the angle at L would be ½ ( measure of arc from G to K that doesn't contain F - measure of arc from F to K that contains G ? Not sure. Maybe better to think in terms of the arcs intercepted by the secants.

Actually, the angle between two secants is ½ ( measure of the larger arc - measure of the smaller arc ). But in our case, since the secants are LGF and LKM, the intercepted arcs would be the arcs between G and K, and the arcs between F and K? Or between G and F?

Wait, the general formula is: if two secants intersect at L outside the circle, and one secant passes through points A and B on the circle, and the other passes through points C and D on the circle, then the angle at L is ½ | arc AC - arc BD |. 

In our case, the two secants are LGF (points G and F) and LKM (point K and another point? Wait, the second secant is line LKM, which passes through K and M. But M is the center, not on the circle. So the only intersection with the circle is at K. Wait, but a secant must intersect the circle at two points. However, if the line LKM passes through K (on the circle) and M (inside the circle), then it only intersects the circle once at K. So it's a tangent? No, it's a secant only if it intersects at two points. Since M is inside the circle, the line LKM passes through K (on the circle) and extends inward to M. So it only intersects the circle at K. Therefore, it's not a secant but a tangent? No, because it only meets the circle once. Wait, but a tangent touches at one point. So this line is a tangent at K? No, because it passes through M, which is the center. So unless K is a special point, but generally, the line from K through M would be a radius, hence the tangent at K would be perpendicular to KM. But in this case, the line LKM is not necessarily tangent, it's just a line passing through K and M.

Wait, this complicates things. So one of the secants is LGF (intersecting the circle at G and F), and the other is LKM, which intersects the the circle only at K. So this is not a secant, it's a single point of intersection. Hence, the angle between LGF and LKM at L is not covered by the standard external angle theorem, since one of the lines is not a secant but a line passing through the circle only once.

Therefore, this suggests that my previous approach is invalid. Hence, I need to rethink.

Given that, maybe the perpendicularity condition indicates something about the power of point L and the triangle formed by LG, LK, and the radius?

Alternatively, since LG ⊥ LK, and L is outside the circle, perhaps there's a relation between the lengths of LG, LK, and the radius. For example, using coordinates.

Maybe assigning coordinates to the circle and solving algebraically.

Let me attempt that.

Assume circle M is at origin (0,0) with radius 2.0.

Let me assign coordinates to points G and F, K, etc., but this might get complex. However, since we have arc HP = 65 degrees, which might help.

Let me try to proceed.

Let me assume that circle M is centered at (0,0) with radius 2. Let me place point H at (2,0). Then, since arc HP is 65 degrees, point P would be located at an angle of 65 degrees from H. So, if H is at (2,0), then P is at angle 65 degrees from H. Wait, but the direction depends on the orientation. Let me define the circle with center M at (0,0). Let me fix coordinate system:

Let me set M at (0,0). Let me place point H at (2,0). Then, arc HP is 65 degrees. Assuming the arc is measured counterclockwise from H to P, then P would be at angle 65 degrees. So coordinates of P would be (2 cos 65°, 2 sin 65°). Let me calculate that.

cos 65° ≈ 0.4226, sin 65° ≈ 0.9063. So P ≈ (2 * 0.4226, 2 * 0.9063) ≈ (0.8452, 1.8126).

Now, point N is on line HJ and line MP. Let me see. Line HJ: since H is at (2,0) and J is another point on the circle. Line MP: M is at (0,0), P is at (0.8452, 1.8126). So line MP connects (0,0) to P.

Point N is on both line HJ and line MP. Let me assume J is some point on the circle. But I need to determine J's location. However, I don't know where J is. But since we need to find arc HJ, perhaps we can relate it to other given information.

Also, there's a perpendicularity condition: Line NP is perpendicular to Line NJ. So at point N, lines NP and NJ are perpendicular. So triangle PNJ is right-angled at N. 

Let me try to express this. Let me denote coordinates for N. Since N is on line MP, which goes from (0,0) to P(0.8452, 1.8126). Parametric equations for line MP: x = t * 0.8452, y = t * 1.8126, where t ≥ 0. When t=1, it's at P; t=0 is at M.

N is on this line, so its coordinates are (0.8452t, 1.8126t) for some t.

Also, N is on line HJ. Let me parametrize line HJ. H is at (2,0), and J is some point on the circle. Let me denote J as (2 cos θ, 2 sin θ), since it's on the circle of radius 2. Then, line HJ connects (2,0) to (2 cos θ, 2 sin θ).

Parametric equation for line HJ: starting at H (2,0), direction vector is (2 cos θ - 2, 2 sin θ - 0) = (2(cos θ - 1), 2 sin θ). So parametric equations: x = 2 + s * 2(cos θ - 1), y = 0 + s * 2 sin θ, where s ∈ ℝ.

Point N is on both line MP and line HJ, so we can set the coordinates equal:

From line MP: x = 0.8452t, y = 1.8126t.

From line HJ: x = 2 + s * 2(cos θ - 1), y = 2s sin θ.

So equating:

0.8452t = 2 + s * 2(cos θ - 1)

1.8126t = 2s sin θ.

We have two equations with variables t and s, and parameter θ. Let me try to eliminate s.

From the second equation: s = (1.8126t) / (2 sin θ).

Substitute into first equation:

0.8452t = 2 + [(1.8126t)/(2 sin θ)] * 2(cos θ - 1)

Simplify:

0.8452t = 2 + [ (1.8126t)(cos θ - 1) ] / sin θ

Rearrange:

0.8452t - [ (1.8126t)(cos θ - 1) / sin θ ] = 2

Factor t:

t [ 0.8452 - (1.8126 (cos θ - 1))/sin θ ] = 2

Let me compute the term in brackets:

Let me denote A = 0.8452, B = 1.8126.

So:

t [ A - B (cos θ - 1)/sin θ ] = 2

Note that B = 1.8126 is approximately 2 * cos(65°), since earlier P had x-coordinate 2 cos 65° ≈ 0.8452. Indeed, cos 65° ≈ 0.4226, so 2 * cos 65° ≈ 0.8452, which matches the x-coordinate of P. So B = 2 cos 65°, and A = 2 cos 65°, since A = 0.8452 ≈ 2 * 0.4226 = 2 cos 65°. So A = B.

Wait, A = 0.8452 ≈ 2 cos 65°, and B = 1.8126 ≈ 2 * sin 65°, since sin 65° ≈ 0.9063, so 2 * sin 65° ≈ 1.8126. Yes, that makes sense. So B = 2 sin 65°, and A = 2 cos 65°.

So substituting:

t [ 2 cos 65° - (2 sin 65° (cos θ - 1))/sin θ ] = 2

Let me factor out 2:

t * 2 [ cos 65° - (sin 65° (cos θ - 1))/sin θ ] = 2

Divide both sides by 2:

t [ cos 65° - (sin 65° (cos θ - 1))/sin θ ] = 1

Let me simplify the term inside the brackets:

cos 65° - [ sin 65° (cos θ - 1) / sin θ ]

Let me write this as:

cos 65° - sin 65° * (cos θ - 1)/sin θ

Let me combine the terms:

Let me write it as:

[ cos 65° * sin θ - sin 65° (cos θ - 1) ] / sin θ

So overall:

t * [ numerator / sin θ ] = 1

Where numerator is:

cos 65° * sin θ - sin 65° (cos θ - 1)

Let me expand this:

= cos 65° sin θ - sin 65° cos θ + sin 65°

Notice that cos 65° sin θ - sin 65° cos θ = sin(θ - 65°), using sine subtraction formula: sin(A - B) = sin A cos B - cos A sin B. Wait, but here it's cos 65° sin θ - sin 65° cos θ = sin(θ - 65°).

So numerator becomes sin(θ - 65°) + sin 65°.

Thus, the entire expression is:

t * [ sin(θ - 65°) + sin 65° ] / sin θ = 1

So:

t = sin θ / [ sin(θ - 65°) + sin 65° ]

This is getting complicated, but maybe we can find θ from the perpendicularity condition.

Recall that at point N, lines NP and NJ are perpendicular. So vector NP · vector NJ = 0.

Vector NP = P - N

Vector NJ = J - N

Let me compute these vectors.

Coordinates of N: from line MP, which is (0.8452t, 1.8126t). Let me denote this as (x_N, y_N).

Coordinates of P: (2 cos 65°, 2 sin 65°) ≈ (0.8452, 1.8126).

Coordinates of J: (2 cos θ, 2 sin θ).

Vector NP = P - N = (2 cos 65° - x_N, 2 sin 65° - y_N)

Vector NJ = J - N = (2 cos θ - x_N, 2 sin θ - y_N)

Their dot product is zero:

(2 cos 65° - x_N)(2 cos θ - x_N) + (2 sin 65° - y_N)(2 sin θ - y_N) = 0

Expanding this:

Let me denote x_N = 0.8452t, y_N = 1.8126t.

So:

[2 cos 65° - 0.8452t][2 cos θ - 0.8452t] + [2 sin 65° - 1.8126t][2 sin θ - 1.8126t] = 0

This looks very complex, but maybe we can substitute t from earlier.

Earlier, we had t = sin θ / [ sin(θ - 65°) + sin 65° ]

Let me denote t = sin θ / D, where D = sin(θ - 65°) + sin 65°.

Plugging this into the equation above would lead to a complicated expression. Perhaps there's a smarter approach.

Alternatively, since we need to find arc HJ, which is the angle θ we defined earlier (since H is at (2,0) and J is at (2 cos θ, 2 sin θ)), so the measure of arc HJ is θ, assuming θ is measured from H to J in the counterclockwise direction. Wait, but θ is the angle for point J relative to the center. Since H is at angle 0°, then the arc HJ would correspond to the angle between H (angle 0°) and J (angle θ), so the arc measure is θ. So if we can find θ, we can get the desired arc measure.

But how to find θ?

Let me think about the perpendicularity condition at N. Since NP ⊥ NJ, and N is on line MP and line HJ, perhaps there's a relation between angles.

Alternatively, since N is on line MP, which is from M(0,0) to P(2 cos 65°, 2 sin 65°), and N is also on line HJ. Let me consider the slope of line HJ and line MP.

The slope of line MP is (y_P - y_M)/(x_P - x_M) = (2 sin 65° - 0)/(2 cos 65° - 0) = tan 65° ≈ 2.1445.

The slope of line HJ: from H(2,0) to J(2 cos θ, 2 sin θ). The slope is [2 sin θ - 0]/[2 cos θ - 2] = [sin θ]/[cos θ - 1].

Since N is the intersection of lines HJ and MP, the slopes of these lines are fixed. But the perpendicularity condition at N involves lines NP and NJ.

Let me think differently: since NP ⊥ NJ, the line NJ is perpendicular to line NP. So the slope of NJ multiplied by the slope of NP is -1.

Let me compute slopes of NJ and NP.

Point N is on line MP, which has slope tan 65°. Let me parametrize N as a point on MP: N = (k * 2 cos 65°, k * 2 sin 65°), where k > 0 (since N is outside or inside the circle depending on k).

Wait, earlier, I used t as a parameter, but now let me use k for clarity.

Let me redefine: Let N be a point on line MP, so N = (k * 2 cos 65°, k * 2 sin 65°), where k is a scalar. If k < 1, N is between M and P; if k = 1, it's at P; if k > 1, it's beyond P.

Also, N is on line HJ. Let me find the condition for N to be on line HJ.

Line HJ passes through H(2,0) and J(2 cos θ, 2 sin θ). The parametric equation for line HJ can be written as:

x = 2 + s(2 cos θ - 2)
y = 0 + s(2 sin θ - 0) = 2s sin θ

For some parameter s.

Since N is on this line, there exists s such that:

k * 2 cos 65° = 2 + s(2 cos θ - 2)

and

k * 2 sin 65° = 2s sin θ.

From the second equation:

s = (k * 2 sin 65°) / (2 sin θ) = k sin 65° / sin θ.

Substituting into the first equation:

k * 2 cos 65° = 2 + [k sin 65° / sin θ] * (2 cos θ - 2)

Divide both sides by 2:

k cos 65° = 1 + [k sin 65° / sin θ] * (cos θ - 1)

Rearrange:

k cos 65° - k sin 65° (cos θ - 1)/sin θ = 1

Factor k:

k [ cos 65° - sin 65° (cos θ - 1)/sin θ ] = 1

Which is the same expression as before, leading to:

k = 1 / [ cos 65° - sin 65° (cos θ - 1)/sin θ ]

Now, we also have the condition that NP ⊥ NJ.

Vector NP is P - N = (2 cos 65° - k * 2 cos 65°, 2 sin 65° - k * 2 sin 65°) = (2 cos 65°(1 - k), 2 sin 65°(1 - k)).

Vector NJ is J - N = (2 cos θ - k * 2 cos 65°, 2 sin θ - k * 2 sin 65°).

Their dot product must be zero:

[2 cos 65°(1 - k)][2 cos θ - 2k cos 65°] + [2 sin 65°(1 - k)][2 sin θ - 2k sin 65°] = 0

Factor out 2(1 - k):

2(1 - k)[ cos 65° (2 cos θ - 2k cos 65°) + sin 65° (2 sin θ - 2k sin 65°) ] = 0

Since 2(1 - k) is not zero (unless k=1, but if k=1, N would be at P, but then NP would be zero vector, which is not valid for perpendicularity), we can divide both sides by 2(1 - k):

cos 65° (2 cos θ - 2k cos 65°) + sin 65° (2 sin θ - 2k sin 65°) = 0

Expand:

2 cos 65° cos θ - 2k cos² 65° + 2 sin 65° sin θ - 2k sin² 65° = 0

Combine terms:

2 [ cos 65° cos θ + sin 65° sin θ ] - 2k [ cos² 65° + sin² 65° ] = 0

Note that cos² α + sin² α = 1, so:

2 [ cos(65° - θ) ] - 2k(1) = 0

Because cos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin B. Here, A = 65°, B = θ, so:

cos(65° - θ) = cos 65° cos θ + sin 65° sin θ.

Thus, the equation becomes:

2 cos(65° - θ) - 2k = 0 → cos(65° - θ) = k.

But earlier, we had k = 1 / [ cos 65° - sin 65° (cos θ - 1)/sin θ ].

So combining:

cos(65° - θ) = 1 / [ cos 65° - sin 65° (cos θ - 1)/sin θ ]

Let me simplify the denominator:

Denominator = cos 65° - [ sin 65° (cos θ - 1) / sin θ ]

As before, this is equal to [ sin(θ - 65°) + sin 65° ] / sin θ, as derived earlier.

Wait, earlier we had:

cos 65° - [ sin 65° (cos θ - 1)/sin θ ] = [ sin(θ - 65°) + sin 65° ] / sin θ.

Wait, let me verify:

Earlier, we had:

cos 65° - [ sin 65° (cos θ - 1)/sin θ ] = [ sin(θ - 65°) + sin 65° ] / sin θ.

Yes, that's what we derived earlier. So the denominator is [ sin(θ - 65°) + sin 65° ] / sin θ, so k = sin θ / [ sin(θ - 65°) + sin 65° ].

But we also have k = cos(65° - θ).

So:

cos(65° - θ) = sin θ / [ sin(θ - 65°) + sin 65° ]

Note that sin(θ - 65°) = -sin(65° - θ), so:

Denominator: sin(θ - 65°) + sin 65° = -sin(65° - θ) + sin 65° = sin 65° - sin(65° - θ).

Thus, the equation becomes:

cos(65° - θ) = sin θ / [ sin 65° - sin(65° - θ) ]

Let me denote φ = 65° - θ. Then, θ = 65° - φ.

Substituting:

Left side: cos φ

Right side: sin(65° - φ) / [ sin 65° - sin φ ]

So:

cos φ = sin(65° - φ) / [ sin 65° - sin φ ]

Let me compute sin(65° - φ) using identity:

sin(A - B) = sin A cos B - cos A sin B.

But here, A = 65°, B = φ.

So sin(65° - φ) = sin 65° cos φ - cos 65° sin φ.

Substituting into the equation:

cos φ = [ sin 65° cos φ - cos 65° sin φ ] / [ sin 65° - sin φ ]

Multiply both sides by denominator:

cos φ [ sin 65° - sin φ ] = sin 65° cos φ - cos 65° sin φ

Expand left side:

cos φ sin 65° - cos φ sin φ = sin 65° cos φ - cos 65° sin φ

Subtract sin 65° cos φ from both sides:

- cos φ sin φ = - cos 65° sin φ

Multiply both sides by -1:

cos φ sin φ = cos 65° sin φ

Assuming sin φ ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by sin φ:

cos φ = cos 65°

Thus, φ = ±65° + 360°n, n integer.

But φ = 65° - θ, so:

Case 1: φ = 65° ⇒ 65° - θ = 65° ⇒ θ = 0°. But θ = 0° would mean J is at (2,0), same as H, which is not allowed since H and J are distinct points.

Case 2: φ = -65° + 360°n. Let's take n=0: φ = -65° ⇒ 65° - θ = -65° ⇒ θ = 65° + 65° = 130°.

So θ = 130°. Let's check if this works.

So θ = 130°, so arc HJ is 130°, which is one of the answer choices (option C is 130). Let me verify if this satisfies the equation.

Let me plug θ = 130° into the earlier equation.

φ = 65° - θ = 65° - 130° = -65°, so cos φ = cos(-65°) = cos 65°, which matches the right side. So this solution is valid.

Therefore, θ = 130°, so the measure of arc HJ is 130°, which is option C.

But let me confirm if there are other solutions. For example, if φ = 65° + 360°n, but that leads to θ = 0°, which is invalid. Other values of n would give θ outside the range of 0° to 360°, but since we're dealing with arcs, θ = 130° is the valid solution.

Therefore, the measure of arc HJ is 130°, so the answer is C.
