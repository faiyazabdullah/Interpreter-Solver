====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out how to find angle x here. So, we have triangle ABC. The problem says that angle at point C (angle ACB) is 60 degrees. Wait, no—wait, the first constraint is MeasureOf(Angle(C, A, B)) equals 60. Let me parse that correctly. In geometry notation, Angle(C, A, B) would mean the angle at point A between points C and B. Wait, no. Wait, angles are usually denoted as the middle letter being the vertex. So Angle(C, A, B) would be the angle at point A, with segments AC and AB forming the sides. Wait, maybe I need to clarify.

Wait, standard notation for angle CAB would be angle at point A between points C and B. But the way it's written here is Angle(C, A, B). So the order is important. In some notations, the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(C, A, B) would be angle at point A between points C and B. Therefore, angle CAB is equal to 60 degrees. Wait, but the question says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C, A, B)), 60), so angle at A is 60 degrees? Or wait, maybe the notation is different. Maybe it's angle at point B? No, the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(C, A, B) is angle at A. Because the middle letter is the vertex. So yes, angle at A is 60 degrees. Then the second angle they mention is MeasureOf(Angle(A, B, C)) which is angle at B, because the middle letter is B. So angle ABC is x. We need to find x. 

So given triangle ABC with angle at A = 60 degrees, side BC opposite angle A has length 12 units. Side AC is 11 units. Wait, hold on. Let me make sure about the sides. The LengthOf(Line(B,C)) is 12. That's the length of BC. And LengthOf(Line(A,C)) is 11, which is the length of AC. So in triangle ABC:

- Side BC = 12
- Side AC = 11
- Angle at A = 60 degrees

We need to find angle at B, which is x.

Hmm. So perhaps using the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines here?

Let me recall the Law of Sines: (a/sin A) = (b/sin B) = (c/sin C). Alternatively, Law of Cosines: c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos C.

But here, since we know one angle and two sides? Wait, let's see. Let me label the triangle properly.

In triangle ABC:

- Vertex A, with angle 60 degrees.
- Side opposite angle A is BC, which is 12 units long.
- Side AC is 11 units. Wait, AC is adjacent to angle A? Wait, side AC is connected to vertices A and C. So in triangle ABC, side AC is opposite angle B. Wait, no. Wait, each side is opposite the corresponding angle. So:

- Side a is opposite angle A. Wait, standard notation is side a is opposite angle A, side b opposite angle B, etc. So if angle A is at vertex A, then side a is BC, which is opposite angle A. Similarly, side b is AC, which is opposite angle B. Wait, no. Wait, side opposite angle A is BC. So side BC is opposite angle A. Then side AC is opposite angle B. Wait, because angle B is at vertex B. So side AC connects points A and C, so it's opposite angle B. Similarly, side AB is opposite angle C.

So given that, let's note down:

Given:

Angle at A (let's call it ∠A) = 60°

Side BC (opposite ∠A) = 12 units

Side AC (opposite ∠B) = 11 units

We need to find angle at B (∠B = x).

So, using Law of Sines:

sin(∠A)/BC = sin(∠B)/AC

Plugging in values:

sin(60°)/12 = sin(x)/11

Therefore, solving for sin(x):

sin(x) = [11 * sin(60°)] / 12

Calculate that value:

First compute sin(60°) which is √3/2 ≈ 0.8660

Then multiply by 11: 11 * 0.8660 ≈ 9.526

Divide by 12: 9.526 / 12 ≈ 0.7938

So sin(x) ≈ 0.7938

Now, take inverse sine (arcsin) of 0.7938 to find x.

Calculating arcsin(0.7938). Let me think. What's arcsin(0.7938)?

Well, sin(52.5°) is approximately... Let me check. For example, sin(50°) ≈ 0.7660, sin(55°) ≈ 0.8192. So 0.7938 is between those. Let me calculate more precisely.

Alternatively, use calculator steps. Since I don't have a calculator here, but I can approximate.

Let me consider that 0.7938 is close to 0.7938. Let me remember that sin(52.5°) is sin(π/2 - 37.5°)? Wait, alternatively, 52.5° is halfway between 50° and 55°, so maybe around there. Let me check using linear approximation.

Between 50° and 55°, sin increases from ~0.7660 to ~0.8192. The difference in sine is approx 0.8192 - 0.7660 = 0.0532 over 5 degrees. Our target is 0.7938, which is 0.7938 - 0.7660 = 0.0278 above 50°. So fraction is 0.0278 / 0.0532 ≈ 0.523. So approx 50° + 0.523*5° ≈ 50° + 2.615° ≈ 52.615°, so approx 52.6 degrees. Which would be close to 52.5°, which is option B. However, let me verify if my calculation was accurate enough.

Alternatively, maybe using more precise method. Let me think again.

Alternatively, using Law of Cosines. Wait, perhaps I made an error in applying the Law of Sines. Let me double-check.

Law of Sines states that (a/sin A) = (b/sin B). Here, a is BC = 12, opposite angle A (which is 60°). b is AC = 11, opposite angle B (which is x). Therefore,

12 / sin(60°) = 11 / sin(x)

Which rearranged gives sin(x) = [11 * sin(60°)] / 12. As before. So that part is correct.

So sin(x) ≈ (11 * 0.8660)/12 ≈ 9.526 / 12 ≈ 0.7938.

So arcsin(0.7938). Let me check exact value. Let me recall that sin(52.5°) is sin(π/2 - 37.5°) but maybe better to use known values.

Alternatively, use calculator-like computation. Suppose I convert 0.7938 into radians? Not helpful without a calculator.

Alternatively, think that 0.7938 corresponds to an angle whose sine is approximately 0.7938. Let me check standard angles. For instance:

sin(52°): Let me recall that sin(52°) ≈ ?

Using Taylor series might be too involved. Alternatively, remember that sin(45°)=√2/2≈0.7071, sin(60°)=√3/2≈0.8660. So 0.7938 is between 45° and 60°, closer to 60°. Wait, but earlier estimation suggested around 52.5°. Wait, but 52.5° is between 50° and 55°, which is between 45° and 60°. Let me check another approach.

Alternatively, use the Law of Cosines to find another side, then apply Law of Sines again. Wait, but maybe that complicates things. Wait, we can also use Law of Cosines directly. Let me try that.

In triangle ABC, we can find side AB, then use Law of Cosines to find angle B.

Wait, but do we know enough information? Let me see. We know angle A = 60°, side BC = 12, and side AC = 11. So, if I can find another side, like AB, then we could use Law of Cosines. Alternatively, use Law of Cosines to find angle B.

Wait, Law of Cosines formula for angle B:

cos(B) = (AB² + BC² - AC²)/(2 * AB * BC)

Wait, but we don't know AB. Hmm. So maybe not helpful yet.

Alternatively, use Law of Cosines on angle A. Since we know angle A and sides adjacent to it? Wait, angle A is between sides AB and AC. Wait, but we only know AC = 11, and BC = 12. Wait, but maybe we can use Law of Cosines to find AB?

Yes! Let me try that. Using Law of Cosines on angle A:

BC² = AB² + AC² - 2 * AB * AC * cos(angle A)

Wait, BC is opposite angle A, so according to Law of Cosines:

BC² = AB² + AC² - 2 * AB * AC * cos(angle A)

Plugging in numbers:

12² = AB² + 11² - 2 * AB * 11 * cos(60°)

Compute 12² = 144, 11²=121, cos(60°)=0.5.

Thus:

144 = AB² + 121 - 2 * AB * 11 * 0.5

Simplify the equation:

144 = AB² + 121 - 11 * AB

Rearranging terms:

AB² - 11 AB + 121 - 144 = 0 → AB² - 11 AB - 23 = 0

So quadratic equation in AB: AB² - 11 AB - 23 = 0

Solving for AB using quadratic formula:

AB = [11 ± sqrt(121 + 92)] / 2 → since discriminant is 121 + 4*23 = 121 + 92 = 213

So sqrt(213) ≈ 14.59

Therefore, AB ≈ [11 + 14.59]/2 ≈ 25.59 / 2 ≈ 12.795

Or negative solution, which we discard since lengths are positive. So AB ≈ 12.795 units.

Now that we have AB, we can use Law of Cosines again to find angle B.

Law of Cosines for angle B:

cos(B) = (AB² + BC² - AC²) / (2 * AB * BC)

Wait, no. Wait, angle B is at vertex B. The Law of Cosines formula for angle B is:

AC² = AB² + BC² - 2 * AB * BC * cos(B)

So rearranged:

cos(B) = (AB² + BC² - AC²) / (2 * AB * BC)

Plugging in the known values:

AB ≈ 12.795, BC = 12, AC = 11

Compute numerator: AB² + BC² - AC² = (12.795)^2 + 12^2 - 11^2

First compute 12.795 squared. Let me approximate that. Let me note that 12.795^2:

Approximate 12.8^2 = 163.84, but since it's slightly less than 12.8, say 12.795 is very close to 12.8. Let me assume approximately 163.84.

Then 12^2 = 144, 11^2 = 121.

So numerator ≈ 163.84 + 144 - 121 = 163.84 + 23 = 186.84

Denominator: 2 * AB * BC ≈ 2 * 12.795 * 12 ≈ 2 * 12.795 * 12 ≈ 25.59 * 12 ≈ 307.08

Therefore, cos(B) ≈ 186.84 / 307.08 ≈ 0.6086

Then angle B is arccos(0.6086). Let me estimate that.

What's arccos(0.6086)? Well, cos(52.5°) is approximately... Let me recall that cos(60°) is 0.5, cos(45°) ≈ 0.7071. So 0.6086 is between 45° and 60°, closer to 52.5°. Let me check cos(52.5°). 

Alternatively, use calculator-like estimates. For example, cos(52.5°):

If I know that cos(50°) ≈ 0.6428, cos(55°) ≈ 0.5736. So our value 0.6086 is between 50° and 55°. Let me interpolate.

At 50°, cos is 0.6428; at 55°, 0.5736. Difference in cosine is 0.6428 - 0.5736 = 0.0692 over 5 degrees. Our value is 0.6086, which is 0.6428 - 0.6086 = 0.0342 below 50°'s value. So fraction is 0.0342 / 0.0692 ≈ 0.494. So angle is approximately 50° + 0.494*(5°) ≈ 50° + 2.47° ≈ 52.47°, which is approximately 52.5°, matching our previous estimation. Thus, angle B is approximately 52.5°, which is option B.

Alternatively, if I had used more precise values for AB, maybe the result would be slightly different. Let me check with more accurate AB calculation.

Earlier, when solving the quadratic equation for AB:

AB² - 11 AB - 23 = 0

Discriminant: 121 + 92 = 213. So sqrt(213) ≈ 14.59 (exact value is sqrt(213) ≈ 14.59). So AB = [11 + 14.59]/2 ≈ 25.59 / 2 ≈ 12.795. Let me compute AB more accurately. Let me compute sqrt(213):

sqrt(213) = sqrt(196 + 17) = sqrt(196 + 17) = 14 + ... Let me compute 14.5^2 = 210.25, 14.6^2 = 213.16. Oh! So sqrt(213) is approximately 14.59, but actually, since 14.6^2 = 213.16, which is just a bit higher than 213. So sqrt(213) ≈ 14.6 - (213.16 - 213)/(2*14.6) ≈ 14.6 - 0.16/(29.2) ≈ 14.6 - 0.0055 ≈ 14.5945. So AB ≈ (11 + 14.5945)/2 ≈ 25.5945 / 2 ≈ 12.79725.

So AB ≈ 12.7973. Now recomputing the numerator:

AB² = (12.7973)^2. Let me compute this more accurately. Let me write AB as 12.7973.

Let me compute 12.7973^2:

First, note that 12.8^2 = 163.84, as before. But since AB is 12.7973, which is 12.8 - 0.0027.

So (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b², where a=12.8, b=0.0027.

So AB² ≈ 163.84 - 2*12.8*0.0027 + (0.0027)^2 ≈ 163.84 - 0.06912 + 0.000007 ≈ 163.84 - 0.06912 ≈ 163.77088.

Then adding BC² (12²=144) and subtracting AC² (11²=121):

Numerator = AB² + BC² - AC² ≈ 163.77088 + 144 - 121 = 163.77088 + 23 = 186.77088.

Denominator: 2 * AB * BC = 2 * 12.7973 * 12 ≈ 2 * 12.7973 * 12 = 25.5946 * 12.

Compute 25.5946 * 12:

25 * 12 = 300, 0.5946 * 12 ≈ 7.1352. Total ≈ 307.1352.

So cos(B) ≈ 186.77088 / 307.1352 ≈ Let me divide these numbers:

First approximate 186.77 / 307.14. Let me compute decimal division:

Divide numerator and denominator by 100: 1.8677 / 3.0714 ≈ ?

Well, 3.0714 × 0.6 = 1.84284

Subtract that from 1.8677: 1.8677 - 1.84284 = 0.02486

So remaining is 0.02486 / 3.0714 ≈ 0.0081

So total is approximately 0.6 + 0.0081 ≈ 0.6081

So cos(B) ≈ 0.6081

Which matches our prior estimate of 0.6086. Close enough. So arccos(0.6081). Let me get a better approximation.

Since cos(52.5°) is what? Let me check using calculator knowledge. If I don't have a calculator, but I know that cos(52.5°) can be calculated using half-angle formulas. Wait, 52.5° is 105°/2. Alternatively, use known values. Alternatively, use that cos(52.5°) = cos(45° + 7.5°). But that may not help much.

Alternatively, use that cos(θ) ≈ 0.6081. Let me think of θ such that cos(θ) = 0.6081. Let me use iterative method.

Assume θ is 52.5°, cos(52.5°) ≈ ?

If I use a calculator (pretending), cos(52.5°) is approximately cos(52.5) ≈ 0.608761. Which is very close to our value of 0.6081. The slight difference is due to rounding errors in our manual calculations. Therefore, angle B is approximately 52.5°, which is option B.

Therefore, the answer should be B. 52.5°.

Alternatively, going back to the Law of Sines approach, where sin(x) ≈ 0.7938. Let me check what angle gives that sine. If I suppose that angle is 52.5°, then sin(52.5°) ≈ ?

Again, if I recall that sin(52.5°) can be computed via the half-angle formula. Let me try:

sin(52.5°) = sin(45° + 7.5°). But that seems complex. Alternatively, use the identity for sin(θ) where θ = 52.5°.

Alternatively, use that 52.5° = 60° - 7.5°, so sin(52.5°) = sin(60° - 7.5°) = sin(60°)cos(7.5°) - cos(60°)sin(7.5°). But calculating this manually is tedious. Alternatively, accept that earlier methods show that angle is approximately 52.5°, which aligns with both Law of Sines and Law of Cosines approaches.

Hence, the correct answer is B. 52.5.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of angle $ \angle ABC $ (denoted as $ x $) in triangle $ ABC $, we are given the following information:

- $ \angle BAC = 60^\circ $
- $ \text{Length}(BC) = 12 $
- $ \text{Length}(AC) = 11 $

This implies that triangle $ ABC $ has:

- One known angle ($ \angle A = 60^\circ $),
- Two known side lengths: $ BC = 12 $ and $ AC = 11 $,
- The goal is to find the unknown angle $ x = \angle ABC $.

---

### Step 1: Use the Law of Sines

The **Law of Sines** relates the angles and sides of a triangle as follows:

$$
\frac{\sin(\angle A)}{BC} = \frac{\sin(\angle B)}{AC}
$$

Substitute the known values:

$$
\frac{\sin(60^\circ)}{12} = \frac{\sin(x)}{11}
$$

Multiply both sides by 11:

$$
\sin(x) = \frac{11}{12} \cdot \sin(60^\circ)
$$

Recall that $ \sin(60^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.8660 $:

$$
\sin(x) = \frac{11}{12} \cdot 0.8660 \approx 0.7938
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve for $ x $

Take the inverse sine of both sides:

$$
x = \arcsin(0.7938)
$$

Estimating this using a scientific calculator or trigonometric tables:

$$
x \approx 52.5^\circ
$$

---

### Final Verification

As an alternative, we could use the **Law of Cosines** to confirm the result. By computing the missing side $ AB $ using the Law of Cosines and then applying it again to find $ \angle B $, we arrive at the same conclusion:

$$
\cos(x) \approx 0.6081 \Rightarrow x \approx 52.5^\circ
$$

Both methods converge to the same result.

---

### Conclusion

The measure of angle $ x = \angle ABC $ is approximately $ 52.5^\circ $. This matches **Answer Choice B**.

---

**Final Answer: B**
