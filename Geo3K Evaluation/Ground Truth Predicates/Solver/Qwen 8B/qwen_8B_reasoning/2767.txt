MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):

Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, C, D. The angles at point B are given: angle ABD is x degrees, angle DBC is 132 degrees, and angle ABC is 65 degrees. Also, all points A, C, D lie on a circle centered at B with radius 1.0. Wait, so that means BA, BC, BD are all radii of the same circle? Because PointLiesOnCircle(A, Circle(B, radius_1_0)) implies that BA is a radius. Similarly for BC and BD. Therefore, BA = BC = BD since they're all radii of the same circle. So triangle ABD, triangle CBD, etc., might be related?

Let me sketch this mentally. Points A, C, D are all on a circle with center B. So B is the center. That makes sense. So BA, BC, BD are all equal in length. Let me think about angles at point B. The angles mentioned are Angle ABD (which is x), angle DBC (132°), and angle ABC (65°). Wait, angle ABC would be the angle between BA and BC. Since BA and BC are both radii, then angle ABC is formed by two radii, so it's a central angle. Similarly, angle ABD and angle DBC are also central angles because they involve BA and BD, and BD and BC respectively.

So the total angle around point B should add up to... Well, if you consider angles around point B, but wait, angles at a point sum to 360 degrees. But here, maybe we need to look at specific angles. Let me see.

First, angle ABC is 65 degrees. That's the angle between BA and BC. Then angle ABD is x, which is between BA and BD. And angle DBC is 132 degrees, which is between BD and BC. So putting these together, the sum of angles around point B along those directions should be angle ABC. Wait, perhaps I need to visualize this.

Imagine point B as the center. Points A, D, and C are on the circumference. If we look at the lines BA, BD, and BC. So starting from BA, going through BD to BC. So angle between BA and BD is x, then between BD and BC is 132 degrees. Therefore, the total angle between BA and BC (angle ABC) should be x + 132 degrees. Wait, that seems important.

But according to the problem statement, measure of angle ABC is 65 degrees. So:

x + 132 = 65 ?

Wait, that can't be right because 132 is already bigger than 65. That would imply x is negative, which isn't possible. Maybe I got the direction wrong. Perhaps angle ABC is not the sum of x and 132, but something else?

Alternatively, maybe angle ABC is part of another configuration. Let me think again. The angle ABC is formed by points A-B-C. So vectors BA and BC. The angle between BA and BC is 65 degrees. Now, there's also angle ABD (between BA and BD) and angle DBC (between BD and BC). So depending on the position of D relative to A and C, the angles could add up or subtract.

If D is positioned such that when you go from BA to BD, then from BD to BC, the total angle from BA to BC is x + 132 degrees. However, since angle ABC is 65 degrees, that would mean x + 132 = 65 → x = -67. Which is impossible. Therefore, my assumption about the direction of the angles must be incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe angle ABC is the difference between x and 132? For example, if D lies on the opposite side of BA compared to C, then the angle between BA and BD could be larger than angle ABC. Hmm. This is getting confusing without a diagram.

Wait, since all three points A, C, D are on the circle centered at B, so BA, BC, BD are all radii. So points A, C, D are all on the circumference, meaning that each of these segments BA, BC, BD are radii. So the positions of A, C, D on the circle determine the angles between them at B.

Now, angle ABC is the angle between BA and BC. So if I imagine the circle with center B, and points A, C, D on the circumference. Depending on their arrangement, the angles between the radii vary.

Suppose we arrange points A, D, C around the circle. Let me consider the order. Suppose D is somewhere between A and C. Then angle ABD would be the angle between BA and BD, and angle DBC would be between BD and BC. So adding those two angles gives angle ABC. Hence, x + 132 = 65. Again, leading to x being negative. Not possible.

Therefore, maybe D is located such that BD is extending in the opposite direction. For instance, if D is diametrically opposed to some point. Alternatively, perhaps the angle ABC is actually the reflex angle, i.e., the larger angle around point B. But typically, angles in geometry problems refer to the smaller ones unless specified otherwise.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different configuration. Let me think again. Let me recall that in a circle, the central angle corresponds to the arc between two points. So the measure of angle ABC is equal to the measure of arc AC. Similarly, angle ABD is equal to arc AD, and angle DBC is equal to arc DC.

Since BA, BD, BC are all radii, the arcs AD and DC correspond to the angles at B. So if angle ABC is 65 degrees, then arc AC measures 65 degrees. Then, if angle ABD is x, then arc AD is x degrees. Similarly, angle DBC is 132 degrees, so arc DC is 132 degrees.

Then, the entire arc AC is equal to arc AD plus arc DC, assuming that D lies between A and C on the circumference. Thus, x + 132 = 65. Again, same problem. Negative x. So that suggests that D is not between A and C, but outside.

Wait, if D is not between A and C, but instead, say, on the other side. So that arc AD and arc DC would overlap or wrap around. For example, if moving from A to D to C goes around the circle more than once. In that case, the total arc AC could be the difference between arc AD and arc DC or vice versa. 

But since angles in circles are measured as the smallest arc between two points. Wait, no. Actually, the central angle is determined by the arc between the two points, and it's always less than or equal to 180 degrees if considering the minor arc. But if the angle is reflex, it's considered as the major arc. However, in standard geometry problems, unless stated otherwise, angles are considered as the non-reflex ones.

So, if angle ABC is 65 degrees, then arc AC is 65 degrees. If angle ABD is x, then arc AD is x degrees. Angle DBC is 132 degrees, so arc DC is 132 degrees. Now, if we assume that D is arranged such that going from A to D to C covers arc AC. But that would require arc AD + arc DC = arc AC. But since arc AC is 65 degrees, and arc DC is 132 degrees, that would make arc AD = 65 - 132 = -67 degrees, which is impossible. Hence, that scenario is invalid.

Alternatively, maybe arc AD is the major arc, and arc DC is the minor arc. Wait, but how does that work? Let me think. Suppose that point D is located such that when you go from A to D, it's the major arc, and then from D to C it's minor. Or perhaps the other way around.

Alternatively, perhaps the points are arranged in the order A, C, D around the circle. Wait, but how does that affect the angles? Let me try to approach this differently. Let me use coordinates.

Assume that point B is at the origin (0,0). Let me assign coordinates to points A, C, D such that BA, BC, BD are all radius 1. Let me pick coordinates for simplicity.

Let me suppose that point A is at (1, 0). Then, since angle ABC is 65 degrees, point C would be located at an angle of 65 degrees from point A. Wait, no. The angle at B between BA and BC is 65 degrees. So if BA is along the positive x-axis, then BC would be at an angle of 65 degrees from BA. So coordinates of C would be (cos(65°), sin(65°)).

Now, point D is another point on the circle. The angles involving D are angle ABD (x) and angle DBC (132 degrees). So angle between BA and BD is x, and between BD and BC is 132 degrees. Therefore, the total angle from BA to BC via BD is x + 132 degrees. But we know that the direct angle from BA to BC is 65 degrees. Therefore, depending on the direction of rotation, either:

Case 1: x + 132 = 65. As before, leading to x negative. Impossible.

Case 2: The total angle around point B is 360 degrees. So if we consider the full rotation, maybe the angles add up in a different way. For example, if the angle from BA to BD is x degrees clockwise, and from BD to BC is 132 degrees counterclockwise, then the net angle would depend on direction. But this is getting too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are measured in different directions. For instance, angle ABD could be on one side, and angle DBC on the other. Let me think. If point D is located such that when you go from BA to BD, it's one direction, and from BD to BC is the other direction. So the total angle between BA and BC could be the difference between x and 132. 

For example, suppose that angle ABD is x degrees in one direction, and angle DBC is 132 degrees in the opposite direction. Then, the net angle between BA and BC would be |x - 132|. Given that angle ABC is 65 degrees, so |x - 132| = 65. Solving this equation:

Either x - 132 = 65 → x = 197, or 132 - x = 65 → x = 67. 

But looking at the answer choices, 67 isn't listed. The options are 65, 132, 163, 180. So 67 is close to 65, but not exact. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, but if the total angle between BA and BC is 65 degrees, and the angles ABD and DBC are x and 132, but they are on opposite sides. So if you imagine that angle ABD is on one side of BA, and angle DBC is on the other side, making the total angle between BA and BC as the sum of those two angles minus something. Wait, this is unclear.

Alternatively, considering that the full circle is 360 degrees. The angles around point B include various angles. Let me think about the sum of all angles around point B. The angles between BA and BD, BD and BC, and others. But without knowing all the angles, it's hard to say.

Wait, but the key thing is that points A, C, D are on the circle. So BA, BC, BD are radii. So the triangle ABD has BA=BD, so it's an isoceles triangle. Similarly for triangle BCD. Wait, but angle at B is x for ABD and 132 degrees for DBC. But maybe using triangle properties?

Wait, but triangles ABD and CBD. For triangle ABD, BA=BD (radii), so it's isoceles with base AD. Therefore, the base angles at A and D are equal. Similarly for triangle CBD, since BC=BD, it's isoceles with base CD. So angles at C and D are equal.

But how does that help us find x?

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that the sum of angles around point B is 360 degrees. But angles around a point sum to 360. So if we have angles between BA and BD (x), between BD and BC (132), and then other angles?

Wait, but there are other points on the circle. But we only have information about angles involving BA, BD, and BC. Unless there are more angles, but the problem only mentions three angles: ABD, DBC, and ABC.

Wait, but angle ABC is 65 degrees. If we think about the angles around point B, there could be multiple angles. Let me try to imagine the full picture. Since A, C, D are on the circle, the lines BA, BD, BC divide the circle into arcs. The angles between these radii are the central angles corresponding to those arcs.

So, for example, angle between BA and BC is 65 degrees (arc AC), angle between BA and BD is x (arc AD), angle between BD and BC is 132 degrees (arc DC). Now, depending on the position of D, these arcs can add up or subtract.

If D is placed such that arc AD + arc DC = arc AC, then x + 132 = 65, which is impossible. But if D is placed such that arc AC = arc AD - arc DC, then x - 132 = 65 → x = 197, which is more than 180, which might be possible if it's a reflex angle. However, in standard geometry problems, angles are usually considered as the smaller ones unless specified. So 197 degrees would be a reflex angle, which might not be intended here.

Alternatively, maybe the arcs are overlapping. For example, if D is on the opposite side of the circle. Let me think of the circle divided into arcs. Let's say arc from A to D is x degrees, arc from D to C is 132 degrees, and the arc from A to C is 65 degrees. If the arc from A to C passes through D, then arc AC would be arc AD + arc DC, so x + 132 = 65, which is impossible. If the arc from A to C doesn't pass through D, then arc AC would be the other way around the circle, which would be 360 - (x + 132) = 65. So:

360 - (x + 132) = 65 → x + 132 = 360 - 65 = 295 → x = 295 - 132 = 163 degrees. 

Ah! This seems plausible. So if the arc from A to C that doesn't pass through D is 65 degrees, while the arc passing through D is 295 degrees, then the central angle for arc AC is 65 degrees, and the arc passing through D is the rest. So in this case, the angle between BA and BD is x, which would correspond to the arc from A to D, and angle between BD and BC is 132 degrees, corresponding to arc from D to C. But since the total arc from A to C via D is 295 degrees, then arc AD + arc DC = 295 degrees. Therefore, x + 132 = 295 → x = 295 - 132 = 163 degrees. 

Looking at the answer choices, option C is 163. So that would be the answer. Let me verify this logic again.

The key idea is that the angle ABC is the smaller arc AC, which is 65 degrees. The other arc AC (the longer one) is 360 - 65 = 295 degrees. If D lies on the longer arc AC, then the arc from A to D plus arc from D to C equals 295 degrees. Hence, x + 132 = 295, giving x = 163. Therefore, the answer should be C.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we begin by analyzing the given geometric setup. All points $ A $, $ C $, and $ D $ lie on a **circle** centered at point $ B $. This tells us that segments $ \overline{BA} $, $ \overline{BC} $, and $ \overline{BD} $ are all **radii** of the circle and therefore have equal length.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Central Angles

- The **central angle** between two radii corresponds to the **arc** between the endpoints of those radii.
- We are told:
  - $ m\angle ABD = x $
  - $ m\angle DBC = 132^\circ $
  - $ m\angle ABC = 65^\circ $

These angles are all **central angles**, meaning they correspond directly to the **arcs** subtended by the respective pairs of radii.

Thus:
- $ \angle ABD $ corresponds to arc $ \overset{\frown}{AD} $
- $ \angle DBC $ corresponds to arc $ \overset{\frown}{DC} $
- $ \angle ABC $ corresponds to arc $ \overset{\frown}{AC} $

---

### Step 2: Use the Arc Sum Property

The arc $ \overset{\frown}{AC} $ can be reached in two ways:
1. Directly through the shorter arc: $ \overset{\frown}{AC} = 65^\circ $ (since $ \angle ABC = 65^\circ $).
2. Indirectly through the longer path: $ \overset{\frown}{AD} + \overset{\frown}{DC} $, which includes point $ D $.

Therefore, the **longer arc** $ \overset{\frown}{AC} $ (passing through $ D $) is:

$$
\text{Longer arc } \overset{\frown}{AC} = 360^\circ - 65^\circ = 295^\circ
$$

This arc consists of:
$$
\overset{\frown}{AD} + \overset{\frown}{DC} = x + 132^\circ
$$

Equating the two expressions for the long arc:

$$
x + 132^\circ = 295^\circ
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ x $

$$
x = 295^\circ - 132^\circ = 163^\circ
$$

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{\text{C}}
$$

Final Answer: C
