====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So we have a quadrilateral ABCD which is a rectangle. The question is asking for the value of x. There are some angle measures given in terms of variables y and x, and also points E lying on lines AC and DB. Hmm, okay. Let me break it down step by step.

First, since ABCD is a rectangle, I remember that all angles in a rectangle are right angles, so each angle should be 90 degrees. That might come into play here. Also, opposite sides are equal and parallel, and diagonals bisect each other. But how do these relate to the given angle measures?

Let me list out the given equations:

1. Measure of Angle at B (angle BDC?) Wait, the notation is Angle(B, D, C). In standard notation, Angle(B, D, C) would mean the angle at point D between points B and C. Wait, no—wait, angle notation is usually vertex in the middle. So Angle(B, D, C) is angle at D formed by points B, D, C. So that's ∠BDC. Similarly, Angle(C, A, D) is angle at A between C and D? Wait, no. Wait, the order is important. For example, Angle(C, A, D) would be the angle at A between points C and D. So that's ∠CAD. Similarly, Angle(B, A, C) is angle at A between B and C, which is ∠BAC. And Angle(A, B, D) is angle at B between A and D, which is ∠ABD.

So, translating all the given equations:

1. m∠BDC = 3y + 10°
2. m∠CAD = 5x + 5°
3. m∠BAC = 2x + 1°
4. m∠ABD = y²

Additionally, there's a point E that lies on both line AC and line DB. Since ABCD is a rectangle, diagonals AC and BD intersect at point E. Because in a rectangle, diagonals bisect each other, so their intersection point E is the midpoint of both diagonals.

Now, since ABCD is a rectangle, diagonals AC and BD are equal in length and bisect each other. Also, the diagonals split the rectangle into two congruent triangles. However, how does this help with the angles?

Let me think about triangle relationships. Let's consider triangle ABD and triangle BCD, but maybe focusing on triangles involving angles mentioned.

Starting with angles at point A. We have ∠BAC (which is part of angle BAD, which is 90° because it's a rectangle). Similarly, ∠BAD is 90°, so ∠BAC + ∠CAD = 90°. Wait, ∠BAC is 2x +1 and ∠CAD is 5x +5. Therefore:

(2x +1) + (5x +5) = 90°
Combine like terms: 7x +6 = 90
Subtract 6: 7x = 84
Divide by 7: x = 12.

Wait, that seems straightforward. If that's the case, then x=12, which is option B. But wait, before jumping to conclusions, need to check if there are more constraints. Because maybe there are other equations involving y that could affect this?

But let me verify again. Since ABCD is a rectangle, angle BAD is 90°, and ∠BAC and ∠CAD are adjacent angles forming that right angle. So adding them gives 90°, leading to x=12. Is there anything wrong here?

Alternatively, perhaps there are relations involving other angles. For instance, considering triangle ADC. Let me check if that holds. Or maybe looking at triangle BDC, where ∠BDC is given as 3y +10. But since ABCD is a rectangle, angle at D is 90°, so in triangle BDC, angles sum up to 180. Let me see.

In triangle BDC, angles are:

At D: ∠BDC = 3y +10°
At C: angle at C is... Well, in rectangle ABCD, angle at C is 90°, but triangle BDC has angle at C? Wait, point C is connected to B and D? Wait, triangle BDC would have vertices B, D, C. So angle at C is angle BCD. But in rectangle ABCD, angle BCD is 90°, yes. Therefore, in triangle BDC, angles are:

At D: 3y +10°, at C: 90°, and at B: ?

Wait, but triangle BDC: sum of angles is 180°, so:

(3y +10) + 90 + angle at B = 180

Therefore, angle at B (in triangle BDC) is 180 - 90 - (3y +10) = 90 - 3y -10 = 80 -3y.

But what is that angle? In triangle BDC, angle at B is ∠CBD. Alternatively, since ABCD is a rectangle, BD is a diagonal, so ∠CBD is part of angle ABC, which is 90°. Wait, angle ABC is 90°, so ∠ABC can be broken into ∠ABD and ∠CBD. From earlier, we had ∠ABD = y². So:

∠ABD + ∠CBD = 90°

Which means:

y² + (80 -3y) = 90

So:

y² -3y +80 = 90

Then:

y² -3y -10 = 0

Solving quadratic equation:

y = [3 ± sqrt(9 + 40)] / 2 = [3 ± sqrt(49)] /2 = [3 ±7]/2

Thus, possible solutions:

(3 +7)/2 = 10/2 =5, or (3-7)/2=-4/2=-2. Since angle measures can't be negative, y=5.

So y=5. Then, let's check if that's consistent with other equations.

Earlier, we found x=12 based on angles at A. Let me check if that's compatible with other parts. For example, angle ABD is y² = 5²=25°. So ∠ABD=25°, and from triangle BDC, ∠CBD was 80 -3y= 80-15=65°. So 25 +65=90°, which matches angle ABC being 90°, so that checks out.

Also, check if other angles make sense. For example, angle CAD is 5x +5. With x=12, that's 5*12 +5=65°. Earlier, angle BAC was 2x +1=25°, so total of 25+65=90°, which is correct for angle BAD. So that works.

Another thing to check: angle ABD is 25°, which is part of triangle ABD. Also, since diagonals in a rectangle bisect each other, point E is the midpoint of diagonals. Maybe there's something else here, but I don't think we need to go further. All the equations seem to check out with x=12 and y=5. 

So the answer should be B. 12. Let me just check if there are any other constraints I missed. For example, maybe angles related to E? The problem mentions that point E lies on both AC and DB, but since they are diagonals of a rectangle, their intersection is E. But unless there's another condition involving E, like some other angles or lengths, but the problem didn't mention any other equations. So probably, the key was using the fact that angles at A add up to 90°, giving us x=12. 

Hence, the answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we start by analyzing the geometric setup: **Quadrilateral $ ABCD $** is a **rectangle**, meaning all interior angles are right angles ($ 90^\circ $), and the diagonals $ AC $ and $ BD $ bisect each other at point $ E $. This provides key symmetry and angle relationships within the figure.

---

### Step 1: Use Given Angles at Vertex $ A $

We are told:
- $ \angle BAC = 2x + 1 $
- $ \angle CAD = 5x + 5 $

These two angles share a common side $ AC $ and together form $ \angle BAD $, which is a corner of the rectangle and therefore a right angle:
$$
\angle BAC + \angle CAD = 90^\circ
$$

Substitute expressions:
$$
(2x + 1) + (5x + 5) = 90
$$
$$
7x + 6 = 90
$$
$$
7x = 84 \Rightarrow x = 12
$$

This suggests $ x = 12 $. Now we verify consistency across the rest of the diagram.

---

### Step 2: Verify Consistency Using Other Angles

From earlier, we know:
- $ \angle ABD = y^2 $
- $ \angle CBD = 80 - 3y $ (from triangle $ BDC $)

Since $ \angle ABC = 90^\circ $, we get:
$$
\angle ABD + \angle CBD = 90
$$
$$
y^2 + (80 - 3y) = 90
$$
$$
y^2 - 3y - 10 = 0
$$

Solving this quadratic:
$$
y = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4(1)(-10)}}{2} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{49}}{2}
$$
$$
y = \frac{3 \pm 7}{2} \Rightarrow y = 5 \text{ (since } y > 0)
$$

So $ y = 5 $, confirming that $ \angle ABD = y^2 = 25^\circ $, and $ \angle CBD = 65^\circ $, satisfying the right angle at $ B $.

---

### Step 3: Final Check

Using $ x = 12 $:
- $ \angle BAC = 2x + 1 = 25^\circ $
- $ \angle CAD = 5x + 5 = 65^\circ $
$$
\angle BAC + \angle CAD = 25 + 65 = 90^\circ
$$

All conditions are satisfied consistently.

---

### Conclusion

The only value of $ x $ that satisfies all given geometric constraints and relationships is:

$$
\boxed{12}
$$
