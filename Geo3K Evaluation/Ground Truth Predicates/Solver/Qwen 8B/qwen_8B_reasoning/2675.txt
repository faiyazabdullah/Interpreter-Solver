MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, first, I need to parse all the given information. Let me start by listing out the constraints:

1. The measure of arc DF is 102 degrees. So, arc DF = 102°.
2. The measure of angle DFC (I think Angle(D, F, C) means angle at point F between points D and C) is equal to the measure of angle 1.
3. Point D lies on line FB. So, D is somewhere on the line connecting F and B.
4. Both points D and F lie on a circle centered at E with radius 4.0. Wait, so D and F are both on the same circle? That would mean they're points on circle E. Therefore, EF and ED are radii of the circle, each 4 units long. So triangle EDF is an isosceles triangle because ED = EF = 4.

Wait, but then maybe there's more here. Also, angle 1 is mentioned. The question is asking for the measure of angle 1, which is equal to angle DFC. Hmm. Let me visualize this.

First, since D and F are both on the circle centered at E, the segment DF is a chord of the circle. The arc DF measures 102°, so that tells us something about the central angle subtended by DF. Since the central angle over arc DF would be equal to the measure of the arc, right? So, the central angle ∠DEF is 102°, because the central angle corresponds to the arc it intercepts.

Now, looking at triangle DEF. Since ED and EF are both radii, triangle DEF is isosceles with ED=EF. Therefore, angles at D and F are equal. Wait, but we know the vertex angle at E is 102°, so the base angles at D and F can be calculated. Let me compute those angles.

The sum of angles in triangle DEF is 180°, so:

∠E + ∠EDF + ∠EFD = 180°
Since ∠EDF = ∠EFD (because triangle is isosceles), let's call them x each.

So 102 + x + x = 180 → 2x = 78 → x = 39°. Therefore, angles at D and F in triangle DEF are each 39°. Wait, so ∠EDF = 39°, ∠EFD = 39°.

But how does this relate to the rest of the diagram?

We also have point C, and angle DFC is equal to angle 1. Let me try to imagine where point C might be. The problem mentions that point D lies on line FB. So, line FB passes through D. Then, angle DFC is formed at point F, with points D, F, C. So, point C is probably another point connected to F and D. But without a diagram, I need to infer based on standard configurations.

Additionally, the problem states that segments that appear tangent are tangent. Maybe some lines are tangents to the circle? For example, FC could be a tangent? Or maybe DC?

Alternatively, perhaps FC is tangent to the circle at point F? If that's the case, then the tangent at F would make an angle with the radius EF. Remember that the tangent at a point is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, if FC is tangent to the circle at F, then ∠EFC would be 90°, since EF is the radius and FC is tangent. However, I don't know yet if FC is tangent. Alternatively, maybe CD is tangent? Or another segment?

Let me think again. We have points D and F on circle E, and line FB passing through D. So, point B is outside the circle? Because D is on line FB, so if the circle has center E, and D is on the circle, then line FB goes through D and extends beyond to point B. 

Now, angle DFC is given as equal to angle 1. So angle at F between D and C. If point C is such that FC is tangent to the circle, then maybe we can use some tangent-secant theorem. For instance, the angle between a tangent and a chord is equal to the measure of the intercepted arc. 

Alternatively, if FC is tangent at F, then angle between FC and FD (since FD is a chord) would be half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Wait, yes! There's a theorem that says the angle between a tangent and a chord is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. Specifically, if you have a tangent at point F, and a chord FD, then the angle between them (∠CFD) is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. 

In this case, if FC is tangent at F, then ∠CFD (which is angle DFC) equals (arc DGF - arc DF)/2, where G is the other intersection... Wait, no, actually, the formula is that the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Since the tangent is at F, and the chord is FD, the intercepted arcs would be the arc from D to the point where the tangent meets the circle... Wait, but the tangent only touches at F, so maybe it's the arc that's opposite to the angle. Wait, let me recall the exact theorem.

The measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a chord is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. Specifically, if the tangent is at point F, and the chord is FD, then the angle between them (∠CFD) is equal to (measure of arc FGD - measure of arc FD)/2, where arc FGD is the major arc. Wait, but since the circle is 360°, maybe we need to consider the arcs properly.

But since we know that arc DF is 102°, then if FC is tangent at F, then the angle between tangent FC and chord FD would be equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are the arc from D to F going the other way around the circle. Wait, the angle between tangent and chord is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. So, if we take the angle formed by the tangent and chord, it's half the difference between the intercepted arc that's opposite the angle and the arc that's adjacent.

Wait, here's a better approach. Let me look up the exact statement. The measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a chord is half the measure of the intercepted arc. Wait, no—actually, that's when the angle is inside the circle. Wait, no—if the angle is outside, like between a tangent and a secant, or two tangents. Wait, no, if it's between a tangent and a chord, then the angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Let me check again. Suppose there's a tangent at point F, and a chord FD. The angle between the tangent and the chord is ∠CFD, where CF is tangent and FD is chord. Then, according to the Tangent-Chord Angle Theorem, the measure of this angle is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc that's opposite to the angle. In this case, the intercepted arc would be the arc from D to the point where the tangent meets the circle... Wait, but the tangent only meets the circle at F. So maybe the intercepted arc is the arc that's opposite the angle. Wait, perhaps the angle is half the measure of the arc that's "cut off" by the chord and tangent. 

Wait, here's a precise statement: The measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a chord drawn from the point of contact is half the measure of the intercepted arc. So, in this case, angle between tangent FC and chord FD is half the measure of the arc that's intercepted by FD and the tangent. Wait, but the tangent only touches at F, so the intercepted arc would be the arc that's not containing the tangent. Wait, maybe the arc that's opposite to the angle. 

If the tangent is at F, and the chord is FD, then the intercepted arc is the arc DF that's not containing the tangent. Wait, but the tangent is at F, so the intercepted arc would be the arc that's opposite the angle. Wait, maybe the arc that's intercepted by the chord FD and the tangent. Since the tangent is at F, the angle is formed at F, so the intercepted arc would be the arc that's across from the angle, i.e., the arc that's not overlapping with the tangent. 

But in our case, arc DF is given as 102°, which is the arc between D and F. If the angle between tangent FC and chord FD is ∠CFD, then according to the theorem, that angle should be half the measure of the arc that's intercepted. Wait, but which arc? It depends on the position of the tangent. If the tangent is on one side of the chord FD, then the intercepted arc would be the arc that's opposite. 

But since the angle is formed by the tangent FC and chord FD, then the intercepted arc would be the arc that's opposite the angle. If the tangent is outside the circle, then the intercepted arc would be the arc that's not containing the tangent. Wait, but in this case, the tangent is at F, so the arc would be the arc from D to the point where the tangent meets the circle... but the tangent only meets at F. This seems confusing. Maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, suppose that FC is tangent to the circle at F. Then, the angle between FC and FD would be equal to half the measure of the arc that's intercepted by FD and the tangent. Wait, but since FC is tangent at F, and FD is a chord, the angle between them is equal to half the measure of the arc that's opposite to the angle, which would be the arc that's not containing the tangent. Wait, but since the tangent is at F, the intercepted arc would be the arc that's opposite the angle. 

Wait, here's a different approach. Let me recall that the angle between a tangent and a chord is equal to the measure of the inscribed angle subtended by the arc opposite the angle. So, if we have tangent FC and chord FD, then ∠CFD is equal to the inscribed angle subtended by arc FD. Wait, but that can't be, unless the inscribed angle is related to the arc. Wait, no. Wait, the angle between tangent and chord is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc. 

Wait, I think I need to refer to the exact formula. According to the Tangent-Secant Angle Theorem, the measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a chord is half the measure of the intercepted arc. So, in this case, if FC is tangent at F, and FD is the chord, then ∠CFD is equal to half the measure of the arc that's intercepted by the chord FD and the tangent. But since the tangent is at F, the intercepted arc would be the arc that's opposite the angle, meaning the arc that's not including F. Wait, but the arc between D and F is already given as 102°, so if that's the arc that's intercepted, then ∠CFD would be half of that. Wait, but that would make ∠CFD = 102 / 2 = 51°, which would mean angle 1 is 51°, so answer A. But wait, that contradicts my previous thought about the intercepted arc. 

Wait, let me double-check. Suppose the tangent is at F, and the chord is FD. The angle between them (∠CFD) is formed. The intercepted arc would be the arc that's not containing the point of tangency. Wait, but the arc between D and F is 102°, which is the minor arc. But the angle between tangent and chord is supposed to be half the measure of the intercepted arc. Wait, but which arc? Is it the minor arc or the major arc?

Actually, the intercepted arc is the arc that is opposite the angle. If the angle is formed outside the circle, then the intercepted arc is the arc that's "facing" the angle. Wait, but in this case, the angle is at the point of tangency. So, if the tangent is at F, and the chord is FD, then the angle is at F, so the intercepted arc is the arc that's opposite the angle, which would be the arc that's not containing F. Wait, but the arc between D and F is the arc that's directly opposite the angle. Wait, but since the tangent is at F, the angle is at F, so the intercepted arc would be the arc that's not containing F, but that's the arc that's between D and the other side. Wait, this is confusing. Maybe I need to draw it mentally.

Imagine the circle with center E, points D and F on the circle. The tangent at F would form a line that just touches the circle at F. Now, the chord FD connects F to D. The angle between the tangent at F and chord FD is ∠CFD, where C is a point along the tangent line. The intercepted arc would be the arc that is opposite to the angle, which would be the arc from D to the point diametrically opposite? No, more precisely, the arc that's not intersected by the angle. Wait, the angle is at F, so the intercepted arc is the arc that's cut off by the chord FD and the tangent. Wait, but the tangent only touches at F, so maybe the intercepted arc is the arc that is not containing F, but that would require knowing the direction of the tangent. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle between the tangent and chord is equal to half the measure of the arc that's intercepted by the chord FD. Wait, but the arc FD is 102°, so then ∠CFD would be 102/2 = 51°, making angle 1 equal to 51°, which is option A. But earlier, I had calculated angles in triangle DEF as 39°, which was angle at F. Wait, in triangle DEF, angle at F is 39°, which was part of triangle DEF. 

Wait, but if angle DFC is equal to 51°, then that would be conflicting with the triangle's angle? Unless angle DFC is not the same as angle in triangle DEF. Wait, angle DFC is at point F, between D and C. If FC is tangent, then angle DFC is 51°, which would be answer A. But then why did I get 39° earlier?

Wait, maybe I need to clarify whether FC is tangent. The problem says "segments that appear tangent are tangent," so maybe FC is tangent. But how do we know? Well, if angle DFC is formed, and given that D and F are on the circle, and if FC is tangent, then angle DFC would be 51°, leading to answer A. But maybe there's another relationship here. 

Alternatively, maybe angle DFC is an inscribed angle. Wait, but if C is outside the circle, then angle DFC could be an external angle. Wait, let's consider that point C is outside the circle, and FC is a tangent. Then, angle DFC would be formed by two lines: FD (a chord) and FC (tangent). As per the theorem, that angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Wait, the formula for the angle between a tangent and a secant is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Wait, but if it's between a tangent and a chord, then it's half the intercepted arc. Wait, confusion arises here.

Let me check once again. The measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a chord is half the measure of the intercepted arc. So, if FC is tangent at F, and FD is the chord, then angle DFC is half the measure of the arc that's intercepted by FD. Wait, but which arc? The arc that is intercepted by FD and the tangent. Since the tangent is at F, the intercepted arc would be the arc that is opposite the angle, which is the arc that's not containing the tangent. Wait, but the arc between D and F is 102°, so that's the arc that's intercepted. Wait, but if the angle is formed by the tangent and chord, then the intercepted arc is the arc that's opposite the angle, which would be the arc that is not containing the point where the tangent meets the circle. Wait, but the tangent meets at F, so the intercepted arc would be the arc from D to F that's not containing the tangent. But since the tangent is at F, the intercepted arc would be the arc that's not containing F, but that's impossible because the arc from D to F includes F. Wait, this is very confusing. 

Alternatively, perhaps the intercepted arc is the arc that is opposite the angle. If the angle is at F, then the intercepted arc is the arc that is not containing F. But since the arc from D to F is given as 102°, the other arc (the major arc) would be 360° - 102° = 258°. So, if the angle between tangent and chord is half the difference between the intercepted arcs. Wait, but earlier, I thought it was half the measure of the intercepted arc. 

Wait, here's a resource I remember: The measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a chord is half the measure of the intercepted arc. So, if the angle is formed by tangent FC and chord FD, then the intercepted arc is the arc that is intercepted by FD and the tangent. Wait, but since the tangent is at F, the intercepted arc would be the arc that's opposite the angle. Which would be the arc that's not containing F. Wait, but the arc between D and F is 102°, which contains F. Wait, no, the arc from D to F is the arc that starts at D, goes through the circle, and ends at F. But if the tangent is at F, then the angle is at F, so the intercepted arc would be the arc that is opposite to the angle, which is the arc that doesn't include F. But since the circle is closed, the arc that doesn't include F would be the major arc DF. Wait, but the major arc DF would be 360° - 102° = 258°, so half of that would be 129°, but that seems too big. Wait, but then angle between tangent and chord would be half the measure of the intercepted arc. Wait, but which arc? 

This is really confusing. Let me think of a concrete example. Imagine a circle with center E, points D and F on the circle, arc DF is 102°, so the central angle ∠DEF is 102°. Now, if I draw a tangent at F, and a chord FD. The angle between the tangent and chord FD is ∠CFD. What is the measure of this angle?

According to the theorem, it should be half the measure of the intercepted arc. But which arc? The intercepted arc is the arc that is opposite the angle, i.e., the arc that is not containing the tangent point. Wait, but the tangent is at F, so the intercepted arc would be the arc that's opposite the angle, which would be the arc that doesn't contain F. But since the arc DF is 102°, the arc that doesn't contain F would be the major arc from D to F through the other side of the circle. Wait, but how is that determined?

Alternatively, maybe it's the arc that is intercepted by the chord FD and the tangent. Since the tangent is at F, the intercepted arc is the arc that is "cut off" by the chord FD and the tangent. But since the tangent only intersects the circle at F, the intercepted arc would be the arc from D to F that is not containing the tangent. Wait, but the arc from D to F is the minor arc (102°), and the major arc (258°). Which one is intercepted?

Ah! Here's the key: When the angle is formed by a tangent and a chord, the intercepted arc is the arc that is **opposite** the angle. So, in this case, since the angle is at F, the intercepted arc is the arc that is not containing the point of tangency (F), which would be the major arc DF. Therefore, the measure of the angle is half the measure of the major arc DF.

Wait, so if arc DF is 102°, the major arc DF is 360° - 102° = 258°, so half of that is 258 / 2 = 129°. But that would mean angle DFC is 129°, which would make angle 1 equal to 129°, which is option D. But that conflicts with earlier thoughts. 

But wait, maybe I got it backwards. Let me confirm with another source. Another way to think about it: the angle between a tangent and a chord is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc. The intercepted arc is the arc that is **intercepted** by the angle, which would be the arc that is opposite the angle. In this case, since the angle is formed at F, the intercepted arc is the arc that is not containing F. But since the tangent is at F, the intercepted arc is the arc that is opposite to the angle, which would be the arc that doesn't include F. However, the arc between D and F is 102°, which includes F. Wait, no—the arc between D and F is from D to F, which includes the point F. So, the intercepted arc would be the other arc, the major arc DF, which is 258°, so half of that is 129°, making angle DFC = 129°, hence angle 1 = 129°, which is option D. 

But earlier, I thought that the angle between tangent and chord is half the measure of the intercepted arc. If that's the case, then angle DFC = 129°, so answer D. But earlier, when I considered triangle DEF, I found that angle at F is 39°, which is different. How does that fit?

Wait, maybe angle DFC is not the same as angle EFD. Because in triangle DEF, angle at F is 39°, which is ∠EFD. But if angle DFC is 129°, then that would be a larger angle, suggesting that point C is located such that FC forms a large angle with FD. 

But how can we reconcile these two? Let me think. If FC is tangent at F, then angle between FC and FD is 129°, which would imply that the tangent makes a very steep angle with FD. Alternatively, maybe the intercepted arc is the minor arc DF, giving angle DFC = 51°, making answer A. Which is correct?

Another way to verify: the measure of the angle between tangent and chord is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc. If the intercepted arc is the arc that is not containing the angle. Wait, in this case, the angle is at F, so the intercepted arc is the arc that is not containing F. Wait, but how can that be? The arc not containing F would be the major arc DF. Hence, angle DFC = ½ * major arc DF = ½*(360 - 102) = ½*258 = 129°, so answer D. 

However, there's another possibility: sometimes, depending on the position of the tangent, the intercepted arc could be the minor arc. But I think the rule is that the angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc that is opposite the angle. So, in this case, since the angle is formed by the tangent and chord, the intercepted arc is the one that is opposite, which is the major arc. 

But wait, there's another theorem: the angle between a tangent and a chord is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc. If the angle is formed by a tangent and a chord, then the intercepted arc is the arc that is **intercepted** by the chord and the tangent. Wait, but the tangent only touches at one point, so the intercepted arc is the arc that is between the endpoints of the chord and the point of tangency? No, that doesn't make sense. 

Wait, perhaps the intercepted arc is the arc that is "cut" by the chord and the tangent. Since the tangent is at F, and the chord is FD, the intercepted arc is the arc from D to F that is not containing the tangent. But since the tangent is at F, the arc from D to F is the arc that is on the opposite side of the circle from the tangent. 

Alternatively, maybe the intercepted arc is the arc that is less than 180°, but that depends on the configuration. 

Given that arc DF is 102°, which is less than 180°, so it's a minor arc. If the angle between tangent and chord is formed at F, then the intercepted arc would be the arc that is opposite, which would be the major arc. So, angle DFC = ½*(major arc DF) = ½*(360 - 102) = 129°, so answer D.

But earlier calculation in triangle DEF gave us angle at F as 39°, which is different. How can this be? Because angle EFD is 39°, which is part of triangle DEF, while angle DFC is another angle at point F, which is separate. So, if angle DFC is 129°, that would mean that line FC is forming an angle of 129° with FD at point F. That would place point C such that FC is extending in a direction making a large angle with FD. 

But then, why is angle DFC equal to angle 1? If angle 1 is 129°, then answer D. But why isn't it matching with the triangle DEF angle?

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in assuming that FC is tangent. Maybe FC is not tangent, but instead, another segment is tangent? The problem says "segments that appear tangent are tangent." So, maybe there is another tangent involved. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is an inscribed angle. Wait, but angle DFC is given to be equal to angle 1. If angle DFC is formed by two chords, then it might be an inscribed angle. Wait, but if FC is not tangent, then angle DFC would be an inscribed angle. 

Wait, but how do we determine if FC is tangent or not? Since the problem says to assume that segments that appear tangent are tangent. Without seeing the diagram, I have to rely on the given constraints. 

Let me re-examine the given constraints:

- Points D and F are on circle E (radius 4).
- Point D lies on line FB.
- Arc DF is 102°.
- Angle DFC equals angle 1.
- Need to find measure of angle 1.

Maybe there's another approach. Let's consider triangle DFC. We know some things about it. If we can find relationships between its sides or angles.

But without knowing where point C is, it's hard to say. However, since D lies on line FB, and F is on the circle, maybe point C is related to other parts of the diagram. 

Wait, maybe there's a cyclic quadrilateral or something else. Alternatively, using power of a point. 

If point C is outside the circle, and FC is tangent to the circle at F, then by power of a point, we have FC² = FD * FB. But we don't know lengths. However, since ED and EF are radii of length 4, maybe we can calculate distances.

Wait, but even without specific lengths, maybe we can find angles. 

Let me go back to the tangent assumption. If FC is tangent at F, then angle DFC = ½*(major arc DF) = 129°, so angle 1 is 129°, answer D. 

Alternatively, if angle DFC is an inscribed angle, then it would be half the measure of its intercepted arc. But for that, angle DFC would need to intercept an arc. 

Wait, if angle DFC is an inscribed angle, then it would intercept arc DC. But without knowing where C is, it's hard to tell. 

Alternatively, since D is on line FB, maybe triangle DFC relates to some other elements. 

Wait, let me think again about the triangle DEF. Earlier, I found that angle at F in triangle DEF is 39°. If line FC makes an angle of 39° with FD, then angle DFC would be 39°, making angle 1 equal to 39°, but that's not among the options. However, 39° is not an option, so that suggests my initial assumption about FC being tangent might be wrong. 

Alternatively, if angle DFC is supplementary to angle EFD. Since angle EFD is 39°, and if FC is a straight line extending from F through E, then angle DFC would be 180° - 39° = 141°, which isn't an option either. 

Hmm. This is tricky. Let me try to think of another approach. 

Given arc DF is 102°, so the central angle ∠DEF is 102°. Points D and F are on circle E. Line FB passes through D. So, line FB goes through D and extends to B. Perhaps point C is related to point B? Or maybe point C is another point on the circle? 

Wait, the problem mentions angle DFC, which is angle at F, between D and C. So, C is some point. If we consider that C is on the circle, then angle DFC would be an inscribed angle. But we don't know. 

Alternatively, if C is the center E? No, because E is the center, and D and F are on the circle. 

Wait, maybe angle DFC is an external angle. For example, if C is outside the circle, and FC is a tangent, then angle DFC would be related to the arcs as discussed before. 

Wait, going back to the original idea: if FC is tangent at F, then angle DFC = ½*(major arc DF) = 129°, which is option D. 

But why would that be the case? Let me verify with an example. Suppose arc DF is 102°, so major arc DF is 258°, half of that is 129°, which would be the measure of angle between tangent and chord. 

Therefore, if angle DFC is this angle, then angle 1 is 129°, answer D. 

But why did I previously think it might be half the minor arc? Because sometimes people confuse between the two. Let me confirm with a textbook definition. 

According to the Tangent-Chord Angle Theorem: The measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a chord is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc. The intercepted arc is the arc that is **opposite** the angle, which is the arc that is not containing the point of tangency. So, in this case, the angle is at F, so the intercepted arc is the arc that does not contain F, which is the major arc DF. Hence, angle DFC = ½*(major arc DF) = 129°, which matches option D. 

Thus, the correct answer would be D. 

But wait, another way to check: if angle between tangent and chord is half the measure of the intercepted arc, and the intercepted arc is the arc that is not containing the tangent point. So, since the tangent is at F, the intercepted arc is the arc that doesn't contain F, which is the major arc DF. Thus, angle DFC = ½*(360 - 102) = 129°, so answer D. 

Yes, this makes sense. So, despite the earlier confusion, this seems correct. Therefore, the measure of angle 1 is 129°, so answer D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $ \angle 1 $, we begin by analyzing the given geometric constraints and applying relevant theorems from circle geometry.

---

### Step 1: Understanding the Given Information

- **Arc $ \overset{\frown}{DF} = 102^\circ $**: This implies the central angle subtending this arc, $ \angle DEF $, is also $ 102^\circ $, since the central angle is numerically equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.

- **Points $ D $ and $ F $ lie on a circle centered at $ E $** with radius $ r = 4.0 $. Therefore, $ ED = EF = 4 $, and triangle $ \triangle DEF $ is isosceles.

- **Angle $ \angle DFC = \angle 1 $**, with point $ C $ positioned such that the angle is formed at $ F $, with segments $ FD $ and $ FC $. The problem specifies that segments appearing to be tangent are indeed tangent.

- **Point $ D $ lies on line $ FB $**, implying that line $ FB $ passes through point $ D $.

---

### Step 2: Applying the Tangent-Chord Angle Theorem

We are told to assume that segments that appear tangent are tangent. Based on the context, it is reasonable to conclude that **$ FC $ is tangent to the circle at point $ F $**.

By the **Tangent-Chord Angle Theorem**, the measure of the angle formed by a **tangent and a chord** (in this case, $ \angle DFC $) is **half the measure of the intercepted arc** that is **not containing the point of tangency**.

- The tangent is at point $ F $, so the intercepted arc is the **major arc** $ \overset{\frown}{DF} $.
- The total circumference of the circle is $ 360^\circ $, and the minor arc $ \overset{\frown}{DF} = 102^\circ $, so the major arc $ \overset{\frown}{DF} = 360^\circ - 102^\circ = 258^\circ $.

Using the theorem:

$$
\angle DFC = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{measure of major arc } DF) = \frac{1}{2} \times 258^\circ = 129^\circ
$$

---

### Step 3: Conclusion

Since $ \angle DFC = \angle 1 $, the measure of $ \angle 1 $ is also $ 129^\circ $.

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{D}
$$
