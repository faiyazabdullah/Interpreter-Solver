MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we need to find the area of a parallelogram based on some given geometric constraints. Let me start by listing out all the information provided.

First, the lengths: AB is 21 units, AC is 17 units, and EC is 8 units. Then there's a point E that lies on line CD, and lines AE and EC are perpendicular. The goal is to find the area of the parallelogram. Hmm.

Wait, but which parallelogram? The problem mentions a parallelogram, so maybe points A, B, C, D, E are part of it? Let me think. Since E is on line CD, and AE is perpendicular to EC, perhaps the parallelogram involves these points?

Let me sketch a rough diagram mentally. Let's assume that ABCD is the parallelogram. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. But then there's point E somewhere. Also, since E lies on CD, maybe AE is a diagonal or something else?

But wait, the problem says Perpendicular(Line(AE), Line(EC)). So AE is perpendicular to EC. That suggests that triangle AEC is a right-angled triangle at E. Because AE ⊥ EC, so angle at E is 90 degrees.

So triangle AEC has legs AE and EC, with EC = 8. And hypotenuse AC = 17. Wait, because AC is given as 17. So if triangle AEC is right-angled at E, then by Pythagoras:

AE² + EC² = AC²  
So AE² + 8² = 17²  
Therefore, AE² = 17² - 8² = (17-8)(17+8) = 9*25 = 225  
Thus, AE = sqrt(225) = 15.

So AE is 15 units long. Now, how does this relate to the parallelogram?

Since ABCD is a parallelogram, vectors AB and AD would define the sides. But I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, maybe AE is related to the height or base of the parallelogram?

Alternatively, since E is on CD, maybe AE is a height? Or maybe there's another way.

Wait, in a parallelogram, the area can also be calculated as base times height. If we can find the base and the corresponding height, that might work.

But first, let me try to figure out coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to points could help. Let me place point E at the origin for simplicity. Let me set coordinate system with E at (0,0). Since AE is perpendicular to EC, and EC is along some direction. Let me suppose that EC is along the x-axis. Then, since EC is length 8, point C would be at (8,0). Then, since AE is perpendicular to EC, meaning AE is vertical. So point A would be at (0, y) for some y. But earlier, we found that AE is 15, so distance from E(0,0) to A(0,y) is |y| = 15. Therefore, A is at (0,15) or (0,-15). Let's take (0,15).

Now, point C is at (8,0). Point A is at (0,15). Now, we know that AB is 21. So point B is such that the distance between A(0,15) and B is 21. But how do we find coordinates of B?

Also, since ABCD is a parallelogram, vector AB equals vector DC, and vector AD equals vector BC. But without knowing more about the positions of D and C, this might be tricky.

Wait, but point E lies on CD. So point E is on CD. We have point C at (8,0). Let me denote coordinates for D. Let me assume that D is some point, and since E is on CD, then E divides CD in some ratio.

But maybe I should find coordinates for D. Let me consider that in a parallelogram ABCD, diagonals bisect each other. However, I don't know if that helps here.

Alternatively, since E is on CD, maybe we can parametrize CD. Let me think.

We have point C at (8,0). Let me call point D as (d_x, d_y). Then, line CD goes from C(8,0) to D(d_x, d_y). Point E(0,0) lies on CD. So, E divides CD in some ratio. Let me write parametric equations for CD.

Parametric equation for CD: starting at C(8,0), moving towards D(d_x, d_y). Any point on CD can be expressed as (8 + t(d_x - 8), 0 + t(d_y - 0)) where t ∈ [0,1]. Since E is on CD, there exists some t such that:

x-coordinate: 8 + t(d_x - 8) = 0  
y-coordinate: 0 + t(d_y) = 0  

From the y-coordinate equation: t*d_y = 0. So either t=0 or d_y=0. If t=0, then E would coincide with C, but E is distinct from C since EC is 8. Hence, d_y must be 0. Therefore, the y-coordinate of D is 0. Thus, D lies on the x-axis.

So D is (d_x, 0). Now, the x-coordinate equation becomes 8 + t(d_x - 8) = 0. Solving for t:

t = -8 / (d_x - 8)

But since E is on CD, t must be between 0 and 1 (assuming D is beyond C or before C). Wait, but depending on where D is. For example, if D is to the left of C, then t would be positive. Let me proceed.

So, since E is on CD, and we have coordinates for E(0,0), C(8,0), D(d_x, 0). Wait, but if both C and D are on the x-axis, then CD is horizontal. Then, point E is on CD, which is the x-axis. But E is already at (0,0). So, the line CD is the x-axis from C(8,0) to D(d_x, 0). So E is somewhere on that line. Since EC is length 8, which is from E(0,0) to C(8,0), so that checks out. Therefore, the coordinates of D must satisfy that E lies on CD. 

If CD is from C(8,0) to D(d_x, 0), then E(0,0) is a point on CD. Let me find the position of D. Let me think. Since E is on CD, the line CD passes through E. So, the points C(8,0), E(0,0), and D must be colinear. Therefore, D lies on the same line as CE, which is the x-axis. Therefore, D is also on the x-axis. So D is (d, 0). Now, since E is between C and D or extended?

Well, if we consider E being on CD, then D could be on either side of C. Let me check the direction. Let me compute the parameter t again.

From earlier, t = -8/(d_x - 8). Since E is on CD, which goes from C(8,0) to D(d_x, 0). So if D is to the left of C, then d_x < 8, so denominator is negative. Then t would be positive if numerator is negative. Wait, let me plug in values. Suppose D is to the left of C, say at (something less than 8). Then d_x - 8 is negative. So t = -8 / (negative number) = positive. So t is positive. So E is between C and D? Wait, no. If D is to the left of C, then moving from C to D would go left. So E(0,0) is between C(8,0) and D(d_x, 0). So for example, if D is (-k, 0), then CD extends from C(8,0) to D(-k, 0). Then E(0,0) is between them. 

Alternatively, if D is to the right of C, then d_x > 8, so d_x - 8 is positive. Then t = -8 / positive = negative. Which would mean that E is not between C and D but rather extended beyond C away from D. But since EC is length 8, and E is at (0,0), then C is at (8,0), so if D were to the right of C, then CD would extend from C(8,0) to D(d_x, 0) where d_x > 8. Then E(0,0) would lie outside segment CD, but still on line CD. But the problem states that E lies on line CD, not necessarily the segment. So both possibilities exist. But since EC is given as 8, which is the length from E to C, regardless of where D is.

But how does this help us? Well, we need to find coordinates for D to determine the rest.

But perhaps we can use the fact that ABCD is a parallelogram. So in a parallelogram, the vector AB equals the vector DC. Let me recall that in a parallelogram, the opposite sides are equal and parallel. So AB is congruent and parallel to DC, and AD congruent and parallel to BC.

Given that, we can find coordinates of B and D. Let me see.

We have point A at (0,15), point B is unknown. Let me denote coordinates:

Point A: (0,15)
Point B: ?
Point C: (8,0)
Point D: (d, 0) (since on x-axis)
Point E: (0,0)

In a parallelogram ABCD, the midpoint of diagonals AC and BD must coincide. So midpoint of AC is ((0 + 8)/2, (15 + 0)/2) = (4, 7.5). Midpoint of BD must also be (4, 7.5). Let me denote coordinates of B as (x, y) and D as (d, 0). Then midpoint of BD is ((x + d)/2, (y + 0)/2) = ((x + d)/2, y/2). Setting equal to (4, 7.5):

(x + d)/2 = 4 => x + d = 8  
and  
y/2 = 7.5 => y = 15

So from this, we get that y = 15, so point B has y-coordinate 15. Also, x + d = 8. So once we find x or d, we can find the other.

Additionally, we know that AB has length 21. Coordinates of A(0,15) and B(x,15). So distance AB is sqrt[(x - 0)^2 + (15 - 15)^2] = sqrt[x²] = |x|. Given that AB = 21, so |x| = 21. Therefore, x = ±21. So possible coordinates for B are (21, 15) or (-21, 15). Let me consider both cases.

Case 1: x = 21. Then from x + d = 8, d = 8 - x = 8 - 21 = -13. So D is at (-13, 0).

Case 2: x = -21. Then d = 8 - (-21) = 8 + 21 = 29. So D is at (29, 0).

So there are two possibilities for B and D. Let me check which one makes sense.

But how does this affect the rest? Let me think. Also, since E is on line CD, which we've already considered. Let me check if there's any other condition that can help us decide between these two cases.

Wait, but maybe the position of E is connected to other parts. Wait, in our setup, E is at (0,0). Is there any relation between E and the other points?

Looking back, the problem didn't mention anything about point B except its distance from A. So maybe both cases are valid. However, since the problem asks for the area of the parallelogram, which may be the same in both cases. Let me check.

Area of parallelogram can be computed as base * height, or using vectors. Alternatively, since we have coordinates, we can use the shoelace formula or determinant.

But let me think. Since we have coordinates for A, B, C, D, we can calculate vectors.

For case 1: B(21,15), D(-13,0). So vectors AB and AD.

Vector AB is B - A = (21 - 0, 15 - 15) = (21, 0). Vector AD is D - A = (-13 - 0, 0 - 15) = (-13, -15). Then the area is the magnitude of cross product of AB and AD.

Cross product AB × AD = (21)(-15) - (0)(-13) = -315 - 0 = -315. The magnitude is 315. So area is 315.

Case 2: B(-21,15), D(29,0). Vector AB is (-21 - 0, 15 - 15) = (-21, 0). Vector AD is (29 - 0, 0 - 15) = (29, -15). Cross product AB × AD = (-21)(-15) - (0)(29) = 315 - 0 = 315. Magnitude is 315. Same area.

So regardless of the case, the area is 315. Therefore, the answer would be option B.

But wait, let me verify once more. Another way to compute area is base * height. Take AB as the base, which is 21. What is the height?

The height would be the perpendicular distance from point D to the line AB. But AB is horizontal (from (0,15) to (21,15)), so it's along y=15. The height would be the vertical distance from D to this line. Since D is at (-13,0) or (29,0), the vertical distance is |15 - 0| = 15. Therefore, area = base * height = 21 * 15 = 315. Yep, matches previous calculation.

So the area is 315, which corresponds to option B.

Therefore, the correct answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the area of the parallelogram, we begin by analyzing the geometric constraints and applying coordinate geometry principles. Here’s the breakdown:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Setup**

We're given:

- $ \text{Length}(AB) = 21 $
- $ \text{Length}(AC) = 17 $
- $ \text{Length}(EC) = 8 $
- $ E $ lies on line $ CD $
- $ AE \perp EC $

This implies that triangle $ \triangle AEC $ is a right triangle at $ E $. Using the Pythagorean theorem:

$$
AE^2 + EC^2 = AC^2 \\
\Rightarrow AE^2 + 8^2 = 17^2 \\
\Rightarrow AE^2 = 225 \Rightarrow AE = 15
$$

---

### **Step 2: Assign Coordinates Based on Geometry**

Place point $ E $ at the origin $(0, 0)$ for convenience. Since $ AE \perp EC $, and $ EC = 8 $, we can align $ C $ along the x-axis:

- Let $ C = (8, 0) $
- Since $ AE = 15 $ and is perpendicular to $ EC $, let $ A = (0, 15) $

Now, point $ D $ lies on the x-axis (because $ E $ lies on line $ CD $), so $ D = (d, 0) $ for some real $ d $.

---

### **Step 3: Use Parallelogram Properties**

Let’s denote the fourth vertex $ B $ such that quadrilateral $ ABCD $ forms a parallelogram. This means:

- $ \vec{AB} = \vec{DC} $
- $ \vec{AD} = \vec{BC} $

Using the midpoint property of diagonals in a parallelogram:

- Midpoint of $ AC = \left(\frac{0 + 8}{2}, \frac{15 + 0}{2}\right) = (4, 7.5) $
- Midpoint of $ BD $ must also be $ (4, 7.5) $

Let $ B = (x, y) $ and $ D = (d, 0) $. Then:

$$
\frac{x + d}{2} = 4 \Rightarrow x + d = 8 \\
\frac{y + 0}{2} = 7.5 \Rightarrow y = 15
$$

So, $ B = (x, 15) $, and $ d = 8 - x $

---

### **Step 4: Use Length Constraint $ AB = 21 $**

Use the distance formula:

$$
AB = \sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (15 - 15)^2} = |x| = 21 \Rightarrow x = \pm21
$$

So, two cases arise:

#### Case 1: $ x = 21 $ → $ d = 8 - 21 = -13 $, so $ D = (-13, 0) $

#### Case 2: $ x = -21 $ → $ d = 8 - (-21) = 29 $, so $ D = (29, 0) $

Both configurations yield the same area due to symmetry.

---

### **Step 5: Compute Area of Parallelogram**

We'll compute the area using the cross product of vectors $ \vec{AB} $ and $ \vec{AD} $:

#### Choose Case 1: $ A = (0,15), B = (21,15), D = (-13,0) $

Vectors:

- $ \vec{AB} = (21, 0) $
- $ \vec{AD} = (-13, -15) $

Compute the cross product:

$$
\text{Area} = |\vec{AB} \times \vec{AD}| = |21 \cdot (-15) - 0 \cdot (-13)| = |-315| = 315
$$

Same result holds true for Case 2.

---

### **Conclusion**

The area of the parallelogram is:

$$
\boxed{315}
$$

---

**Final Answer: B**
