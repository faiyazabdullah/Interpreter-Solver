Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, we need to find the area of a parallelogram based on some given constraints. Let me start by listing out all the information provided.

First, there's an angle at point B between points C, B, D that measures 45 degrees. Then, the length of line AD is 13 units, and the length of line AC is 10 units. Also, there's a point E lying on line CB, and lines DE and EC are perpendicular. Hmm, okay.

Wait, the question asks for the area of the parallelogram. But which parallelogram? The problem mentions points A, B, C, D, E. Maybe the parallelogram is ABCD? Or maybe another shape? Wait, since it's a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. Let me think about how these points could form a parallelogram.

But first, let me visualize the diagram. Let me sketch mentally. Points A, B, C, D. Since there's a mention of line AD being 13 and AC being 10. Also, point E lies on line CB, and DE is perpendicular to EC. That seems important.

Let me note down the key elements:

1. Angle at B (angle CBD) is 45 degrees.
2. Length AD = 13
3. Length AC = 10
4. Point E is on line CB such that DE ⊥ EC.

So, perhaps triangle CDE is right-angled at E? Because DE is perpendicular to EC. So, triangle CDE is a right triangle with right angle at E. Therefore, CE is one leg, DE is another leg, and CD is hypotenuse?

But wait, CD might not necessarily be part of the parallelogram. Alternatively, maybe the parallelogram is ABDC or something else. Let me think again.

Since we have a parallelogram, two pairs of parallel sides. If ABCD is a parallelogram, then AB || CD and AD || BC. However, given that there's a point E on CB, and DE is perpendicular to EC, so maybe E is somewhere along CB. 

Alternatively, maybe the figure isn't a standard parallelogram but requires using coordinates to model it. Coordinates might help here because we can assign coordinates to points and use slopes and distances.

Let me try coordinate geometry. Let's set up a coordinate system. Let me assume point B is at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, since angle at B is 45 degrees, involving points C, B, D. Let me consider that.

If I place point B at (0,0). Let me suppose that line BC is along the x-axis. So, point C would be somewhere along the x-axis. Let me denote coordinates:

Let’s say point B is at (0,0). Let me assume point C is at (c, 0) for some c > 0. Now, point D is such that angle CBD is 45 degrees. Since angle at B is between points C, B, D, so BD makes a 45-degree angle with BC (which is along the x-axis). Therefore, BD is making a 45-degree angle above the x-axis. So, direction of BD is 45 degrees from x-axis.

Therefore, coordinates of D can be expressed parametrically. Suppose BD has length k. Then coordinates of D would be (k cos 45°, k sin 45°). Which simplifies to (k√2/2, k√2/2).

Now, also given that length AD is 13. So point A is connected to D, and distance AD is 13. Also, length AC is 10. So point A is connected to C, and that distance is 10.

Additionally, there's a point E on line CB (so line from C to B, which is the x-axis from (0,0) to (c,0)) such that DE is perpendicular to EC. Let me think about that condition.

First, let me define variables for coordinates:

Points:

B: (0, 0)

C: (c, 0)

D: (d_x, d_y) = (k√2/2, k√2/2) as before.

But also, since AC = 10. Let me denote coordinates of A as (a_x, a_y). Then distance AC is sqrt[(a_x - c)^2 + (a_y - 0)^2] = 10.

Also, distance AD is sqrt[(a_x - d_x)^2 + (a_y - d_y)^2] = 13.

Moreover, point E lies on CB. Since CB is from C(c, 0) to B(0,0), so parametric equations for CB can be written as (t*c, 0) where t ranges from 0 to 1. So point E can be represented as (e, 0) where e is between 0 and c.

Then, DE is perpendicular to EC. Vector DE is from D to E: (e - d_x, 0 - d_y). Vector EC is from E to C: (c - e, 0 - 0) = (c - e, 0). For DE and EC to be perpendicular, their dot product should be zero.

Dot product of DE and EC vectors equals zero:

(e - d_x)(c - e) + (-d_y)(0) = 0 => (e - d_x)(c - e) = 0.

Thus, either e = d_x or c - e = 0 (i.e., e = c). But e = c would mean point E coincides with point C, which may not make sense in context unless specified. However, if e = c, then vector EC would be zero vector, which can't be perpendicular to anything. Hence, more likely, the solution comes from e = d_x. Therefore, e = d_x. Thus, point E is (d_x, 0). Therefore, E lies on CB at x-coordinate equal to d_x. 

So, this gives us that E has coordinates (d_x, 0). Therefore, DE connects D(d_x, d_y) to E(d_x, 0), which is vertical line segment (since x-coordinates are same). Therefore, DE is vertical. And EC connects E(d_x, 0) to C(c, 0), which is horizontal line. Therefore, DE is vertical, EC is horizontal, hence they are perpendicular. This checks out. So that's consistent with the given condition. 

Therefore, from this, we can see that the x-coordinate of E is equal to the x-coordinate of D, which is d_x. Therefore, this gives us that E is directly below D on the x-axis. 

Now, moving forward. Let me recap:

We have coordinates:

B: (0,0)

C: (c, 0)

D: (d_x, d_y) = (k√2/2, k√2/2) for some k.

E: (d_x, 0)

Now, we need to relate this with the rest of the information. Also, we know AC = 10 and AD = 13. Let me express coordinates of A in terms of variables.

But how do we find coordinates of A? Well, perhaps we need another relation. Since ABCD is supposed to be a parallelogram? Wait, but the problem says "the parallelogram", but hasn't explicitly stated which one. However, given that AC is mentioned (connecting A and C), and AD is mentioned (connecting A and D), perhaps ABCD is the parallelogram? In that case, in a parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other. However, in general, the diagonals aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a rhombus or square. But here, we don't know that yet.

Alternatively, maybe the parallelogram is ABED or something else. Wait, but without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to tell. However, since the problem refers to the area of the parallelogram, and given the information, perhaps ABCD is the intended parallelogram.

Assuming ABCD is a parallelogram, then AB is parallel and equal to CD, and AD is parallel and equal to BC. Wait, but in that case, BC is the base from B(0,0) to C(c,0), so BC has length c. Then AD should be equal to BC. But AD is given as 13. Therefore, BC would be length 13. Therefore, c = 13? Wait, but hold on, BC is the length from B(0,0) to C(c,0), which is |c - 0| = c. So if AD is 13, then BC should be 13. Therefore, c = 13? But then AC is given as 10. Let me check if that holds.

Wait, if ABCD is a parallelogram, then AC would be a diagonal. The length of diagonal AC can be computed using the formula for parallelograms: if sides are AB and AD, then the diagonals satisfy AC² + BD² = 2(AB² + AD²). But maybe that's getting too ahead.

Alternatively, if ABCD is a parallelogram, then coordinates of A can be determined based on coordinates of B, C, D.

In a parallelogram, vector AB equals vector DC. Let me think. Let me recall that in a parallelogram, the coordinates can be defined such that if you have points A, B, C, D in order, then vector AB equals DC, and vector AD equals BC.

Alternatively, if we take points A, B, C, D arranged such that AB and DC are opposite sides, AD and BC are opposite sides.

But since we have coordinates for B, C, D, maybe we can find coordinates for A.

Alternatively, considering that in a parallelogram, the midpoint of diagonals coincide. So midpoint of AC equals midpoint of BD.

Midpoint of AC: ((Ax + Cx)/2, (Ay + Cy)/2)

Midpoint of BD: ((Bx + Dx)/2, (By + Dy)/2)

Since B is (0,0), C is (c,0), D is (d_x, d_y). So midpoint of BD is ((0 + d_x)/2, (0 + d_y)/2) = (d_x / 2, d_y / 2). Midpoint of AC is ((Ax + c)/2, (Ay + 0)/2) = ((Ax + c)/2, Ay/2). Setting them equal:

(Ax + c)/2 = d_x / 2 → Ax + c = d_x → Ax = d_x - c

and Ay / 2 = d_y / 2 → Ay = d_y.

So coordinates of A are (d_x - c, d_y).

Now, we also know that the length of AD is 13. Let's compute AD. Coordinates of A: (d_x - c, d_y). Coordinates of D: (d_x, d_y). So vector AD is (d_x - (d_x - c), d_y - d_y) = (c, 0). Therefore, length AD is sqrt(c² + 0²) = c. But according to the problem, AD = 13. Therefore, c = 13. So that tells us that BC is length c = 13, which matches our earlier thought.

Therefore, c = 13. So coordinates of C are (13, 0).

Also, coordinates of A are (d_x - 13, d_y). Now, we also know that AC = 10. Let's compute AC. Coordinates of A: (d_x - 13, d_y), coordinates of C: (13, 0). So vector AC is (13 - (d_x - 13), 0 - d_y) = (26 - d_x, -d_y). The length of AC is sqrt[(26 - d_x)^2 + (-d_y)^2] = sqrt[(26 - d_x)^2 + d_y^2] = 10. Therefore,

(26 - d_x)^2 + d_y^2 = 100. Equation (1).

Additionally, we had earlier that D lies along the direction of 45 degrees from point B. Earlier, we considered that D is at (k√2/2, k√2/2). But since we now know that c=13, and point D is connected to B via angle CBD of 45 degrees. Wait, but how does that relate to coordinates of D?

Earlier assumption was that BD makes a 45-degree angle with BC (which is along x-axis). So direction of BD is 45 degrees, implying that slope of BD is tan(45°)=1. Therefore, coordinates of D can be parametrized as (t, t) for some t. Wait, but earlier I used (k√2/2, k√2/2) assuming BD has length k. However, if BD has slope 1, then yes, coordinates would be (t, t). But in that case, the length of BD is sqrt(t² + t²) = t√2. So if we let BD length be m, then t = m / √2. Therefore, coordinates of D would be (m/√2, m/√2). 

But regardless of parameterization, the coordinates of D are (d_x, d_y) where d_x = d_y. Because slope is 1, so rise over run is 1, so y = x. Therefore, d_x = d_y. Let me note that. So d_x = d_y.

Therefore, equation (1): (26 - d_x)^2 + d_y^2 = 100 becomes (26 - d_x)^2 + d_x^2 = 100. Because d_y = d_x.

Expanding this:

(26 - d_x)^2 + d_x^2 = 100  
Expand (26 - d_x)^2: 26² - 52d_x + d_x²  
So total expression: 26² - 52d_x + d_x² + d_x² = 100  
Which is 676 - 52d_x + 2d_x² = 100  
Bring 100 to left side: 2d_x² -52d_x + 676 -100 = 0  
Calculate 676 - 100 = 576  
So equation: 2d_x² -52d_x + 576 = 0  
Divide both sides by 2: d_x² -26d_x + 288 = 0  

Solving quadratic equation: d_x² -26d_x + 288 = 0  
Discriminant D = 26² - 4*1*288 = 676 - 1152 = -476? Wait, that can’t be. Wait discriminant is b² - 4ac = (-26)^2 -4*(1)*(288) = 676 - 1152 = -476. Negative discriminant? That suggests no real solutions. But that can’t be possible. There must be an error in my reasoning.

Wait, let me retrace steps. Where did I go wrong?

Starting from the equation:

(26 - d_x)^2 + d_x^2 = 100.

Wait, expanding (26 - d_x)^2 + d_x^2:

= 26² - 52d_x + d_x² + d_x²  
= 676 - 52d_x + 2d_x². Correct.

Set equal to 100:

2d_x² -52d_x + 676 = 100  
→ 2d_x² -52d_x + 576 = 0  
Divide by 2: d_x² -26d_x + 288 = 0. Yes.

Discriminant: D = (26)^2 - 4 * 1 * 288 = 676 - 1152 = -476. Negative. So no real roots. Contradiction. What does that mean?

Hmm, so this suggests inconsistency in the assumptions. Which means there's a mistake in previous steps. Let me check where I went wrong.

First, when I assumed that ABCD is a parallelogram, leading to coordinates of A as (d_x - c, d_y). Is that correct?

Let me verify. In a parallelogram, the midpoint of diagonals are the same. So midpoint of AC equals midpoint of BD.

Coordinates of midpoint of BD: since B is (0,0) and D is (d_x, d_y), midpoint is (d_x/2, d_y/2). 

Coordinates of midpoint of AC: A is (Ax, Ay), C is (c, 0). So midpoint is ((Ax + c)/2, (Ay + 0)/2). 

Setting equal:

(Ax + c)/2 = d_x / 2 ⇒ Ax + c = d_x ⇒ Ax = d_x - c  
Similarly, Ay / 2 = d_y / 2 ⇒ Ay = d_y. 

Yes, that's correct. So coordinates of A are (d_x - c, d_y). Then, length AD is distance between A and D. Coordinates of A: (d_x - c, d_y). Coordinates of D: (d_x, d_y). So difference in x: d_x - (d_x - c) = c. Difference in y: d_y - d_y = 0. So AD length is sqrt(c² + 0) = c. Given that AD = 13, so c = 13. So that part is correct.

Then, AC is the distance between A and C. Coordinates of A: (d_x - 13, d_y). Coordinates of C: (13, 0). So difference in x: 13 - (d_x - 13) = 26 - d_x. Difference in y: 0 - d_y = -d_y. Therefore, squared distance: (26 - d_x)^2 + (d_y)^2 = 100. But since earlier we established that d_x = d_y (because BD has slope 1, so y = x). Therefore, substituting d_y = d_x into equation:

(26 - d_x)^2 + d_x^2 = 100. Which leads to the quadratic with negative discriminant. Which suggests inconsistency. Therefore, contradiction arises. So my assumption that ABCD is a parallelogram might be incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the parallelogram isn't ABCD. Perhaps another configuration? Or maybe my assumption about the coordinates of D is wrong?

Wait, let me reconsider the angle at B. The angle is angle CBD, which is between points C, B, D. So vertex at B, with segments BC and BD forming the angle. Earlier, I assumed that BD is at 45 degrees from BC (which is along x-axis), hence slope 1. But maybe BD is not in that direction? Wait, angle CBD is 45 degrees. So depending on the orientation, maybe BD is going upwards or downwards? Since it's a parallelogram, probably upwards. But even then, slope would still be positive.

Alternatively, maybe BD is not along slope 1, but has some other direction? Wait, no. The angle between BC and BD is 45 degrees. Since BC is along x-axis from B(0,0) to C(13,0). So BD forms a 45-degree angle with BC. So direction of BD is either upwards or downwards. Assuming it's upwards, then slope is tan(45) = 1. So coordinates of D would be along line y = x, starting from B(0,0). So D is (t, t) for some t. Therefore, d_x = t, d_y = t. So earlier conclusion that d_x = d_y holds. 

But then why does the equation lead to impossible scenario?

Alternative approach: Perhaps the parallelogram isn't ABCD, but another one? Like ABED or something else? Or maybe the parallelogram involves point E?

Wait, the problem says "the parallelogram"—but didn't specify which one. Maybe the parallelogram is ABED? Or another combination. Alternatively, maybe the problem refers to a different parallelogram, like AECB or something else. 

Alternatively, perhaps my initial assumption that ABCD is a parallelogram is wrong. Let me think differently. Let me try to find coordinates of all points using the given conditions without assuming ABCD is a parallelogram.

Given:

- Angle CBD is 45 degrees.

- AD = 13

- AC = 10

- E lies on CB, DE ⊥ EC.

From earlier analysis, E is (d_x, 0), and D is (d_x, d_y), with d_x = d_y (due to 45 degree angle). Let me keep that.

So D is (t, t), where t is some value. Then, E is (t, 0). Now, let me try to find coordinates of A.

We also know AC = 10. Let me denote coordinates of A as (a_x, a_y). Then distance from A to C(13,0) is sqrt[(a_x -13)^2 + (a_y)^2] = 10 → (a_x -13)^2 + a_y^2 = 100. Equation (1).

Also, distance from A to D(t, t) is 13: sqrt[(a_x - t)^2 + (a_y - t)^2] = 13 → (a_x - t)^2 + (a_y - t)^2 = 169. Equation (2).

Now, we need another equation to relate these variables. What else is given?

The fact that E lies on CB and DE is perpendicular to EC. We already used that to determine E is (t, 0). Are there other relations? Maybe the fact that ABCD is a parallelogram? Or maybe another relation?

Wait, if we can find coordinates of A, then we might be able to find t, and thus find coordinates of all points. But we have two equations (Equation 1 and 2) with three variables (a_x, a_y, t). Need another equation.

Perhaps there's a relationship from the parallelogram? But since we don't know which parallelogram, maybe we need to infer it from the given data.

Wait, the problem says "the parallelogram". Maybe it's referring to a parallelogram formed by points A, B, C, D? Or maybe A, B, E, D? Or another set.

Alternatively, since there's a point E involved, maybe the parallelogram includes E. Let me think. For example, if AECD is a parallelogram? Or something else.

Alternatively, since we have a right angle at E between DE and EC, maybe triangle CDE is part of the figure, and the parallelogram relates to that.

Alternatively, maybe the area of the parallelogram is related to the area of triangle CDE or something similar.

Alternatively, since we have coordinates for D and E, and possibly others, maybe we can find vectors to calculate area.

Alternatively, perhaps the parallelogram is ABED? Let me check.

Assume ABED is a parallelogram. Then AB || ED and BE || AD. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's tricky.

Alternatively, since we have coordinates for points A, B, C, D, E, and relationships between them, maybe we can find relations.

Wait, let me try to proceed with Equations 1 and 2. Let me expand Equation 2:

(a_x - t)^2 + (a_y - t)^2 = 169  
=> a_x² - 2ta_x + t² + a_y² - 2ta_y + t² = 169  
=> a_x² + a_y² - 2t(a_x + a_y) + 2t² = 169. Equation (2a)

From Equation 1:

(a_x - 13)^2 + a_y^2 = 100  
=> a_x² - 26a_x + 169 + a_y² = 100  
=> a_x² + a_y² -26a_x = -69. Equation (1a)

Subtracting Equation (1a) from Equation (2a):

[ a_x² + a_y² - 2t(a_x + a_y) + 2t² ] - [ a_x² + a_y² -26a_x ] = 169 - (-69)  
Simplify:

-2t(a_x + a_y) + 2t² - (-26a_x) = 238  
=> -2t(a_x + a_y) + 2t² +26a_x = 238  
Let me factor terms with a_x:

a_x(-2t +26) + a_y(-2t) + 2t² = 238. Equation (3)

This seems complicated. Maybe we need another relation. Let me think.

Is there any other condition? The only other thing is that point E lies on CB, which we already used. Also, the fact that DE is perpendicular to EC, which led us to E being (t, 0). 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express a_x and a_y in terms of t, using Equations 1 and 2?

Let me attempt to subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2.

Wait, Equation 2: (a_x - t)^2 + (a_y - t)^2 = 169  
Equation 1: (a_x -13)^2 + a_y^2 = 100

Expand both:

Equation 2: a_x² - 2ta_x + t² + a_y² - 2ta_y + t² = 169  
Equation 1: a_x² -26a_x + 169 + a_y² = 100

Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:

[ a_x² - 2ta_x + t² + a_y² - 2ta_y + t² ] - [ a_x² -26a_x + 169 + a_y² ] = 169 - 100  
Simplify term by term:

a_x² cancels with -a_x².

-2ta_x remains.

+ t² remains.

a_y² cancels with -a_y².

-2ta_y remains.

+ t² remains.

Then subtract the rest: - (-26a_x) = +26a_x, -169.

Right-hand side: 69.

So overall:

-2ta_x + t² -2ta_y + t² +26a_x -169 = 69  
Combine like terms:

-2ta_x -2ta_y + 26a_x + 2t² -169 = 69  
Move constants to RHS:

-2t(a_x + a_y) + 26a_x + 2t² = 69 + 169 = 238  
Which is the same as Equation (3) above.

Still stuck. Need another equation.

Maybe we can find another relation from the parallelogram? Wait, perhaps the fact that ABCD is a parallelogram, which would give us more relations. Let me try that again, despite earlier contradiction.

Assume ABCD is a parallelogram. Then, as before, midpoint of AC equals midpoint of BD. Which gave us coordinates of A as (d_x - c, d_y), with c = 13. So A is (t - 13, t), since d_x = t, d_y = t. 

Then, plugging into Equation 1: (a_x -13)^2 + a_y^2 = 100.

With a_x = t - 13, a_y = t.

So [(t - 13) -13]^2 + (t)^2 = 100  
→ (t - 26)^2 + t² = 100  
Expand: t² -52t + 676 + t² = 100  
→ 2t² -52t + 676 - 100 = 0  
→ 2t² -52t + 576 = 0  
Divide by 2: t² -26t + 288 = 0  
Which is the same quadratic as before, with discriminant D = 676 - 1152 = -476. No real solutions. So contradiction.

This suggests that assuming ABCD is a parallelogram leads to no solution. Hence, my assumption is wrong.

Therefore, ABCD is not a parallelogram. So need to discard that assumption.

Alternative idea: Maybe the parallelogram is AEDC? Or another combination. Let me think.

Alternatively, since we have point E, perhaps the parallelogram is ABED or something else. Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider the right triangle CDE. Since DE is perpendicular to EC, triangle CDE is right-angled at E. So, in this right triangle, legs are EC and DE, and hypotenuse CD.

So, CD² = EC² + DE².

But CD is the distance from C to D. Coordinates of C are (13, 0), coordinates of D are (t, t). So CD² = (t - 13)^2 + (t - 0)^2 = (t -13)^2 + t².

EC is the distance from E(t, 0) to C(13, 0), which is |13 - t|. DE is distance from D(t, t) to E(t, 0), which is sqrt((t - t)^2 + (t - 0)^2) = t. So DE = t.

Therefore, CD² = (13 - t)^2 + t² = (EC)^2 + (DE)^2 = (13 - t)^2 + t². Which is true, so this identity holds. Not helpful for finding t.

But maybe combining with other information. Let me recall that we also have AC = 10. Coordinates of A are unknown, but maybe there's a relation through the parallelogram.

Wait, if the parallelogram is AEDC, then it would require AE || DC and ED || AC. Or some other property. Without knowing which sides are parallel, it's difficult. Alternatively, since we have AC = 10, and AD = 13, perhaps we can relate them.

Wait, if we consider triangles or something. Let me think. From earlier, we have coordinates of A as (a_x, a_y), and expressions from Equations 1 and 2. Maybe I need to find t?

Wait, but how?

Let me try to combine Equation 1 and Equation 2. Let me write them again:

Equation 1: (a_x - 13)^2 + a_y^2 = 100  
Equation 2: (a_x - t)^2 + (a_y - t)^2 = 169  

Let me expand Equation 1: a_x² -26a_x + 169 + a_y² = 100 → a_x² + a_y² = 26a_x - 69. Equation (1b)

Expand Equation 2: a_x² - 2ta_x + t² + a_y² - 2ta_y + t² = 169 → a_x² + a_y² - 2t(a_x + a_y) + 2t² = 169. Equation (2b)

Substitute Equation (1b) into Equation (2b):

(26a_x - 69) - 2t(a_x + a_y) + 2t² = 169  
→ 26a_x - 69 - 2t(a_x + a_y) + 2t² = 169  
Rearrange: 26a_x - 2t(a_x + a_y) + 2t² = 169 + 69 = 238  
→ 26a_x - 2t(a_x + a_y) + 2t² = 238. Equation (4)

Still have two variables a_x and a_y. Need another relation.

Wait, is there any other condition? The problem states that E lies on CB, but we already used that to determine E's coordinates. Also, the angle at B is 45 degrees, which we used to determine that D lies along y = x.

Is there a relation between A and other points? Perhaps through the parallelogram? But since we don't know which parallelogram, it's unclear.

Wait, maybe the parallelogram is ABED? Let me assume that ABED is a parallelogram. In that case, AB || ED and BE || AD.

Vector AB = B - A = (0 - a_x, 0 - a_y) = (-a_x, -a_y)

Vector ED = D - E = (t - t, t - 0) = (0, t)

For AB || ED, vectors must be scalar multiples. So (-a_x, -a_y) = k*(0, t). This implies -a_x = 0*k = 0 → a_x = 0, and -a_y = kt. So if a_x = 0, then from Equation 1: (0 -13)^2 + a_y^2 = 100 → 169 + a_y^2 = 100 → a_y^2 = -69. Impossible. Hence, invalid.

Another possibility: parallelogram AEDC. So AE || DC and ED || AC.

Vector AE = E - A = (t - a_x, 0 - a_y)

Vector DC = C - D = (13 - t, 0 - t)

For AE || DC: AE = λ DC.

So (t - a_x, -a_y) = λ(13 - t, -t)

Thus:

t - a_x = λ(13 - t) ...(i)

-a_y = -λt → a_y = λt ...(ii)

From (ii): λ = a_y / t. Substitute into (i):

t - a_x = (a_y / t)(13 - t)  
Multiply both sides by t: t(t - a_x) = a_y(13 - t)  
→ t² - ta_x = 13a_y - ta_y  
→ t² - ta_x -13a_y + ta_y = 0 ...(iii)

Also, from Equation 1: (a_x -13)^2 + a_y^2 = 100 ...(1)

And from Equation 2: (a_x - t)^2 + (a_y - t)^2 = 169 ...(2)

Now, we have Equation (iii): t² - ta_x -13a_y + ta_y = 0.

Let me try to express a_x from this equation.

From (iii): t² - ta_x = 13a_y - ta_y  
→ t² = ta_x + 13a_y - ta_y  
→ ta_x = t² -13a_y + ta_y  
→ a_x = t - (13a_y - ta_y)/t  
Wait, this might get messy. Let me see if I can find another way.

Alternatively, from Equation (ii): λ = a_y / t, and from (i): t - a_x = λ(13 - t) = (a_y/t)(13 - t). So:

t - a_x = (a_y(13 - t))/t  
→ a_x = t - [a_y(13 - t)/t]  
= t - (13a_y)/t + a_y  
= t + a_y - (13a_y)/t  
= t + a_y(1 - 13/t)  

Now, substitute this expression for a_x into Equation 1: (a_x -13)^2 + a_y^2 = 100.

Let me denote a_x as t + a_y(1 - 13/t). Let me compute a_x - 13:

a_x -13 = t + a_y(1 - 13/t) -13  
= t -13 + a_y(1 - 13/t)  

Let me call this expression as X. So X = t -13 + a_y(1 - 13/t).

Then, (X)^2 + a_y^2 = 100.

This seems complex, but perhaps we can find a relation using Equation 2 as well. Let me also recall Equation 2: (a_x - t)^2 + (a_y - t)^2 = 169.

Let me compute a_x - t = [t + a_y(1 - 13/t)] - t = a_y(1 - 13/t) = a_y( (t -13)/t ). So:

(a_x - t)^2 = [a_y(t -13)/t]^2 = a_y² (t -13)^2 / t².

And (a_y - t)^2 = a_y² - 2ta_y + t².

So Equation 2 becomes:

[a_y² (t -13)^2 / t²] + a_y² - 2ta_y + t² = 169.

This seems very complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.

Let me think differently. Since we have two equations (1) and (2), and we need to find t. Let me try to assume specific values or find another relation.

Wait, let me try to think about the area of the parallelogram. The problem asks for the area of the parallelogram. If I can find the base and height, or use vectors.

But without knowing which parallelogram, it's challenging. Let me think: if the parallelogram is AEDC, then its area would be base * height, or |AE × ED|, etc. Alternatively, if it's another parallelogram.

Alternatively, since we have a right triangle CDE, and knowing DE and EC, perhaps the area relates to that.

Wait, in triangle CDE, right-angled at E, area is (EC * DE)/2. But how does this relate to the parallelogram?

If the parallelogram is made by doubling the triangle, then area would be twice that. But without knowing which parallelogram, it's uncertain.

Alternatively, since AC = 10 and AD = 13, and if those are diagonals or sides of the parallelogram...

Wait, if AC and AD are diagonals, but in a parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other. But earlier attempts showed contradictions.

Alternatively, if AC and AD are sides of the parallelogram. For example, if the parallelogram has sides AC and AD, then the area would be |AC × AD|, which is |AC||AD|sin(theta), where theta is the angle between them. But we don't know theta, but maybe it's related to the given 45-degree angle.

Wait, the given angle at B is 45 degrees. Maybe that angle is related to the angle between AC and AD?

Not sure. Let me try this approach.

Suppose the parallelogram has sides AC and AD, and the angle between them is 45 degrees. Then area would be |AC||AD|sin(45) = 10 * 13 * (√2/2) ≈ 130 * 0.707 ≈ 91.9. Which is option B. But this is just a guess. But why would the angle between AC and AD be 45 degrees? It's not clear from the problem statement. The given angle is at B, not directly related to AC and AD.

But if this is the case, then the area would be approximately 91.9, which is option B. But I need to justify this.

Alternatively, let me think about vectors. Suppose vectors AC and AD form the parallelogram. Then the area is the magnitude of their cross product. But to find this, I need the angle between them. If the angle between AC and AD is 45 degrees, then area is 10*13*sin(45) ≈ 91.9. But how to justify the angle between AC and AD is 45 degrees?

The given angle is at B, which is angle CBD = 45 degrees. Maybe there's a relationship between this angle and the angle between AC and AD.

Alternatively, let me try to use coordinates. Assume that the parallelogram is ABD C, but earlier attempts showed issues. But let me try to proceed.

From earlier, we had the quadratic equation with no solution, suggesting that my assumptions were wrong. Maybe there is a miscalculation.

Let me revisit the quadratic equation: t² -26t + 288 = 0. Discriminant D = 676 - 1152 = -476. Negative. So no real solution. But this suggests that under the assumption that ABCD is a parallelogram, there is no solution. Hence, this indicates that ABCD is not a parallelogram, and I need to look elsewhere.

Maybe the parallelogram is AEDC? Let me try to compute its area. For parallelogram AEDC, the area would be base * height. Let me see.

Point A, E, D, C. To compute area, we can use shoelace formula if we know coordinates. But to do that, I need coordinates of all four points. Let me try to find t.

From earlier, we have:

From Equation 1: (a_x -13)^2 + a_y^2 = 100  
From Equation 2: (a_x - t)^2 + (a_y - t)^2 = 169  
And from the assumption that AEDC is a parallelogram, which gives us a_x = t + a_y(1 - 13/t) from earlier. Let me substitute this into Equation 1.

Let me denote a_x = t + a_y(1 - 13/t) = t + a_y - (13a_y)/t.

Substitute into Equation 1: (a_x -13)^2 + a_y^2 = 100.

Compute a_x -13 = t + a_y - (13a_y)/t -13 = (t -13) + a_y(1 - 13/t).

Let me denote this as K = (t -13) + a_y(1 - 13/t).

So, K^2 + a_y^2 = 100.

Let me also recall from Equation 2: (a_x - t)^2 + (a_y - t)^2 = 169.

From earlier, a_x - t = a_y(1 - 13/t). Let me call this M = a_y(1 - 13/t). So M = a_y( (t -13)/t ).

Then, Equation 2 becomes M² + (a_y - t)^2 = 169.

So, [a_y² (t -13)^2 / t²] + (a_y - t)^2 = 169.

Let me expand this:

Let me denote a_y as y for simplicity.

So: y² (t -13)^2 / t² + (y - t)^2 = 169.

Also, from K^2 + y^2 = 100, where K = (t -13) + y(1 - 13/t).

This is very complex, but maybe I can find t by trial and error or substitution.

Alternatively, let me assume that t is a rational number, and try to find it.

Let me try to assume t = 12. Let's see.

If t = 12, then D is (12, 12). E is (12, 0). Then, CD is from (13, 0) to (12, 12): distance squared is (13-12)^2 + (0-12)^2 = 1 + 144 = 145. So CD = sqrt(145). EC is 13 - 12 = 1, DE is 12. So 1² + 12² = 1 + 144 = 145, which matches CD². Good.

Now, let's check if with t = 12, we can find a_x and a_y satisfying Equations 1 and 2.

From Equation 1: (a_x -13)^2 + a_y^2 = 100.

From Equation 2: (a_x -12)^2 + (a_y -12)^2 = 169.

Let me expand both:

Equation 1: a_x² -26a_x + 169 + a_y² = 100 → a_x² + a_y² = 26a_x - 69.

Equation 2: a_x² -24a_x + 144 + a_y² -24a_y + 144 = 169 → a_x² + a_y² -24a_x -24a_y + 288 = 169 → a_x² + a_y² = 24a_x + 24a_y - 119.

Now, equate the two expressions for a_x² + a_y²:

26a_x - 69 = 24a_x + 24a_y - 119  
→ 26a_x -24a_x -24a_y = -119 + 69  
→ 2a_x -24a_y = -50  
→ a_x -12a_y = -25  
→ a_x = 12a_y -25. Equation (v)

Now, substitute a_x = 12a_y -25 into Equation 1: (a_x -13)^2 + a_y^2 = 100.

Compute a_x -13 = 12a_y -25 -13 = 12a_y -38.

So (12a_y -38)^2 + a_y^2 = 100.

Expand (12a_y -38)^2: 144a_y² - 912a_y + 1444.

Add a_y²: 145a_y² -912a_y + 1444 = 100.

So 145a_y² -912a_y + 1344 = 0.

Divide by GCD(145, 912, 1344). Let me see: 145 factors into 5*29; 912 ÷ 145 ≈ 6.29. Not divisible. Let me compute discriminant:

D = 912² - 4*145*1344.

Calculate 912²: 912*912. Let me approximate:

900² = 810000, 12² = 144, 2*900*12 = 21600. Total: 810000 + 21600 + 144 = 831744.

4*145*1344 = 4*145*1344. Let me compute 145*1344 first.

145*1344 = 145*(1300 + 44) = 145*1300 + 145*44 = 188500 + 6380 = 194880.

Then multiply by 4: 194880 * 4 = 779520.

So D = 831744 - 779520 = 52224.

Square root of 52224: let me calculate. 228² = 51984, 229² = 52441. So between 228 and 229. Let me check 228.5² = (228 + 0.5)^2 = 228² + 228 + 0.25 = 51984 + 228 + 0.25 = 52212.25. Still less than 52224. Next, 228.6² = (228.5 + 0.1)^2 = 52212.25 + 2*228.5*0.1 + 0.1² = 52212.25 + 45.7 + 0.01 = 52257.96, which is greater than 52224. So sqrt(D) is approx 228.5 + (52224 - 52212.25)/(2*228.5) ≈ 228.5 + 11.75/457 ≈ 228.5 + 0.0257 ≈ 228.5257.

So a_y = [912 ± 228.5257]/(2*145) = [912 ± 228.5257]/290.

Let me compute both possibilities:

First, a_y = (912 + 228.5257)/290 ≈ 1140.5257/290 ≈ 3.933.

Second, a_y = (912 - 228.5257)/290 ≈ 683.4743/290 ≈ 2.3568.

Now, let's check these values.

First, a_y ≈ 3.933. Then a_x = 12*3.933 -25 ≈ 47.196 -25 = 22.196.

Check Equation 1: (a_x -13)^2 + a_y^2 ≈ (22.196 -13)^2 + (3.933)^2 ≈ (9.196)^2 + 15.467 ≈ 84.57 + 15.467 ≈ 100.037. Close enough, considering rounding errors.

Second, a_y ≈ 2.3568. Then a_x = 12*2.3568 -25 ≈ 28.2816 -25 = 3.2816.

Check Equation 1: (3.2816 -13)^2 + (2.3568)^2 ≈ (-9.7184)^2 + 5.553 ≈ 94.45 + 5.553 ≈ 100.003. Also close.

So both solutions are valid. Now, let's check Equation 2: (a_x -12)^2 + (a_y -12)^2 = 169.

For first solution: a_x ≈ 22.196, a_y ≈ 3.933.

Compute (22.196 -12)^2 + (3.933 -12)^2 = (10.196)^2 + (-8.067)^2 ≈ 103.95 + 64.99 ≈ 168.94, which is approximately 169. Good.

For second solution: a_x ≈ 3.2816, a_y ≈ 2.3568.

Compute (3.2816 -12)^2 + (2.3568 -12)^2 = (-8.7184)^2 + (-9.6432)^2 ≈ 75.99 + 92.98 ≈ 168.97, also approximately 169. Good.

So both solutions are valid. Now, which one is the correct one?

Now, let's recall that in the parallelogram AEDC, the area would be |(vector AE × vector AD)| or something similar. But since we're assuming AEDC is a parallelogram, let's compute its area.

Vector AE = E - A = (12, 0) - (a_x, a_y) = (12 - a_x, -a_y).

Vector AD = D - A = (12, 12) - (a_x, a_y) = (12 - a_x, 12 - a_y).

Area of parallelogram AEDC is |AE × AD| = |(12 - a_x)(12 - a_y) - (-a_y)(12 - a_x)| = |(12 - a_x)(12 - a_y + a_y)| = |(12 - a_x)*12| = |12(12 - a_x)|.

So area is 12|12 - a_x|.

Now, let's compute this for both solutions.

First solution: a_x ≈ 22.196. So 12 - a_x ≈ -10.196. Absolute value: 10.196. Multiply by 12: 12 * 10.196 ≈ 122.35.

Second solution: a_x ≈ 3.2816. So 12 - a_x ≈ 8.7184. Absolute value: 8.7184. Multiply by 12: 104.62.

Now, looking at the answer choices: A. 65, B. 91.9, C. 112.6, D. 130.

Both 122.35 and 104.62 are near options C (112.6) and none of the others. But need to check which one is correct.

But how to determine which solution is correct?

Let me think about the position of point A. If a_x = 22.196 and a_y = 3.933, then point A is far to the right, while if a_x = 3.2816 and a_y = 2.3568, it's closer to B.

But we need to ensure that the parallelogram AEDC makes sense. Let me check if the vectors AE and AD are indeed forming the parallelogram.

Alternatively, let me think about the original angle at B being 45 degrees. With t = 12, D is (12, 12), E is (12, 0), so DE is vertical, EC is horizontal, as before. Now, with point A in either position, how does it affect the angle at B?

Actually, the given angle is at B, which is angle CBD = 45 degrees, which we've already satisfied by placing D at (12, 12). So the position of A doesn't affect this angle. Hence, both solutions are possible, but we need to determine which one gives the correct area.

But the problem states that the parallelogram is to be found. If there are two possible areas, but only one is among the choices, we need to choose the correct one.

Looking at the computed areas: 122.35 and 104.62. The closest to these are option C (112.6) and none for the second. But 122.35 is closer to C (112.6)? No, 122.35 is higher than C. Option D is 130. Let me check if there's a calculation error.

Wait, for the first solution, the area is 12 * |12 - a_x|. For a_x = 22.196, 12 - a_x is -10.196, absolute value 10.196, multiplied by 12: 12 * 10.196 ≈ 122.35. This is close to option C (112.6) but not exactly. Option B is 91.9, which is lower. 

For the second solution, area is 12 * 8.7184 ≈ 104.62, which is closer to option C (112.6) or B? 104.62 is closer to B (91.9)? No, it's between B and C. But none of the options match exactly. However, the problem says to round to the nearest tenth if necessary.

Wait, let me recalculate the area for the second solution. a_x ≈ 3.2816, so 12 - a_x = 8.7184. Area is 12 * 8.7184 = 104.62. This is approximately 104.6, which is closer to option C (112.6)? No, it's 104.6, which is between B (91.9) and C (112.6). But none of the options match. However, perhaps there is an error in my calculation of the area.

Wait, earlier I said that the area of parallelogram AEDC is |AE × AD|, but let me double-check this.

Vectors AE and AD: if AEDC is a parallelogram, then vectors AE and AD should be adjacent sides. Wait, no. In a parallelogram, adjacent sides are AE and ED, or something else. Let me clarify.

Parallelogram AEDC: vertices A, E, D, C. So the sides are AE, ED, DC, and CA? Or maybe AE, EC, CD, DA? Wait, need to ensure the sides are parallel.

Actually, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. So if it's AEDC, then AE || DC and ED || AC.

Vector AE = E - A = (12 - a_x, -a_y)

Vector DC = C - D = (13 - 12, 0 - 12) = (1, -12)

For AE || DC, vectors must be scalar multiples. So (12 - a_x, -a_y) = k*(1, -12). So:

12 - a_x = k  
-a_y = -12k → a_y = 12k. 

From first equation: k = 12 - a_x. Substituting into a_y = 12k: a_y = 12(12 - a_x) = 144 - 12a_x. 

Now, from earlier, we had from Equation (v): a_x = 12a_y -25.

Substitute a_y = 144 - 12a_x into this:

a_x = 12*(144 - 12a_x) -25  
a_x = 1728 - 144a_x -25  
a_x = 1703 - 144a_x  
a_x + 144a_x = 1703  
145a_x = 1703  
a_x = 1703 / 145 ≈ 11.7448.

Then, a_y = 144 - 12a_x ≈ 144 - 12*11.7448 ≈ 144 - 140.9376 ≈ 3.0624.

Now, let's check if this satisfies Equation 1: (a_x -13)^2 + a_y^2 = 100.

a_x ≈ 11.7448, a_y ≈ 3.0624.

(a_x -13)^2 = (11.7448 -13)^2 ≈ (-1.2552)^2 ≈ 1.5755.

a_y^2 ≈ 9.377.

Sum ≈ 1.5755 + 9.377 ≈ 10.9525, which is not 100. So this is inconsistent. Hence, there must be an error in the assumption.

Wait, this suggests that the assumption that AE || DC leads to inconsistency, meaning that AEDC is not a parallelogram. Hence, my earlier calculation of the area was incorrect.

This indicates that my approach to calculating the area was wrong. Let me try another method.

Since I'm stuck, let me recall that in the first scenario, with t = 12, we had two possible solutions for a_x and a_y, giving two possible areas. One was ~122.35 and the other ~104.62. These are close to options C (112.6) and none others. Given that 122.35 is closer to option C (112.6)? No, it's higher. But if I calculate precisely, let me check.

Wait, let me calculate the area using the two solutions.

First solution: a_x ≈ 22.196, a_y ≈ 3.933.

If the parallelogram is AEDC, then area can be calculated as the base times height. Let me take base as EC = 1 (since EC = 13 - t = 13 -12 = 1). Height would be the perpendicular distance from A to EC. Since EC is along x-axis from E(12,0) to C(13,0), so it's horizontal. The height is the vertical distance from A to this line, which is |a_y|.

So area = base * height = 1 * |a_y| = |a_y|.

In this case, a_y ≈ 3.933, so area ≈ 3.933. This is much smaller than the options, so this can't be correct.

Second solution: a_x ≈ 3.2816, a_y ≈ 2.3568. Same logic: base EC = 1, height |a_y| = 2.3568. Area ≈ 2.3568, still small. So this approach is wrong.

Ah, I see! My earlier assumption about the area was incorrect. The area of parallelogram AEDC is not base * height, but depends on the vectors.

Alternatively, since we have points A, E, D, C, the area can be calculated using the shoelace formula. Let me try that.

For the first solution: a_x ≈ 22.196, a_y ≈ 3.933.

Points: A(22.196, 3.933), E(12, 0), D(12, 12), C(13, 0).

Shoelace formula:

List the points in order: A, E, D, C, A.

Compute sum of x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i.

Compute:

x_A*y_E - x_E*y_A = 22.196*0 - 12*3.933 = 0 - 47.196 = -47.196

x_E*y_D - x_D*y_E = 12*12 - 12*0 = 144 - 0 = 144

x_D*y_C - x_C*y_D = 12*0 - 13*12 = 0 - 156 = -156

x_C*y_A - x_A*y_C = 13*3.933 - 22.196*0 = 51.129 - 0 = 51.129

Total sum: -47.196 + 144 -156 + 51.129 = (-47.196 -156) + (144 + 51.129) = -203.196 + 195.129 = -8.067

Take absolute value and divide by 2: | -8.067 | / 2 = 4.0335. Area ≈ 4.03, which is still too small. So this suggests that my assumption about the parallelogram is wrong.

This indicates that the area calculation is not straightforward, and my entire approach is flawed.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, let me consider another approach. Let me recall that the area of the parallelogram could be related to the product of AC and AD multiplied by sin(theta), where theta is the angle between them. If I can find theta.

Given that angle at B is 45 degrees, maybe this angle is related to theta.

Let me consider vectors BA and BC. Wait, BA is from B to A, and BC is from B to C. The angle between BA and BC is 45 degrees? No, the angle at B is between CB and BD, not BA and BC.

But if I can relate the angle between AC and AD to the given 45 degrees, maybe through some geometric relations.

Alternatively, let me use coordinates with t = 12, and use one of the solutions for a_x and a_y to compute the area of the parallelogram.

Let me take the second solution: a_x ≈ 3.2816, a_y ≈ 2.3568.

Now, let's assume the parallelogram is ABED. Let me check if this is a parallelogram.

Vector AB = B - A = (0 - 3.2816, 0 - 2.3568) = (-3.2816, -2.3568)

Vector ED = D - E = (12 - 12, 12 - 0) = (0, 12)

For ABED to be a parallelogram, AB should be equal and parallel to ED. But AB is (-3.2816, -2.3568), and ED is (0, 12). Not parallel, so not a parallelogram.

If the parallelogram is AEDC, as before, it didn't work.

Alternatively, let me consider the parallelogram formed by vectors AC and AD. If the angle between AC and AD is 45 degrees, then area is |AC||AD|sin(45) = 10*13*(√2/2) ≈ 130*0.707 ≈ 91.9, which is option B. This might be the intended answer, even though the justification is not rigorous.

Given that this matches one of the options and the calculation is simple, and given the time I've spent without finding a better approach, I'll go
