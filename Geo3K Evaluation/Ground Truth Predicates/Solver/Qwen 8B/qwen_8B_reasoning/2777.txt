MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, we have several points and lines with specific length constraints and perpendicularity conditions. The goal is to find the value of z, which is the length of line AF. Let me start by visualizing the problem based on the given constraints.

First, let me note down all the given information:

1. Length of FB is x.
2. Length of AB is y.
3. Length of AF is z.
4. Length of FL is 2√3.
5. Length of AL is √3.
6. Point B lies on line FL.
7. Line FB is perpendicular to line AB.
8. Line AF is perpendicular to line AL.

Hmm. Also, since there are multiple points mentioned (F, B, A, L), I need to figure out their positions relative to each other. Maybe drawing a diagram would help, but since I can't draw here, I'll try to imagine it.

Let me consider coordinate geometry. Assign coordinates to these points to make calculations easier. Let's assume some coordinates for simplicity. Since there are perpendicular lines involved, maybe placing certain points at origin or axes could simplify things.

Starting with point A. Let me place point A at the origin (0,0). Then, since line AL has length √3 and line AF is perpendicular to AL, perhaps I can align AL along one axis and AF along another.

Wait, line AF is perpendicular to line AL. So, if AL is along some direction, then AF should be perpendicular to that. Let me think.

Let me first handle the perpendicularity conditions. 

We know that line FB is perpendicular to line AB. And line AF is perpendicular to line AL. 

Also, point B lies on line FL. Let me try to assign coordinates step by step.

Let me suppose that point A is at (0,0). Let me take AL as a reference. Suppose AL is along the x-axis. Wait, but AF is perpendicular to AL. If AL is horizontal, then AF would be vertical. But then, line AF is vertical, so point F would lie somewhere along the vertical line through A. However, point B is connected to both A and F, and also lies on FL. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I need to set up coordinates such that some lines are aligned with axes.

Let me try again. Let me assume that point A is at (0,0). Since AL has length √3, and AF is perpendicular to AL, let me define AL as lying along the x-axis. Therefore, point L would be at (√3, 0), because AL = √3. Wait, but AL is from A(0,0) to L. So yes, if AL is along x-axis, then L is at (√3, 0).

Now, since AF is perpendicular to AL, which is along x-axis, so AF must be vertical. That means line AF is vertical. Therefore, point F lies somewhere along the y-axis? Wait, no. If AF is vertical, then starting from A(0,0), moving vertically upwards or downwards. So coordinates of F would be (0, k) for some k. Wait, but then AF's length is |k|, so z = |k|. 

But also, point B lies on line FL. Let me find coordinates of F and L. Since L is at (√3, 0) and F is at (0, k). So line FL connects (0, k) to (√3, 0). Let me parametrize that line.

Parametric equations for line FL: Starting at F(0,k), going towards L(√3, 0). So direction vector is (√3 - 0, 0 - k) = (√3, -k). Any point on FL can be written as (t√3, k - t*k), where t ranges from 0 to 1. Wait, when t=0, we get F(0,k); when t=1, we get L(√3, 0). So point B lies somewhere on this line. So coordinates of B can be represented as (t√3, k - t*k) for some parameter t.

Additionally, we have that line FB is perpendicular to line AB. Let's recall that line AB goes from A(0,0) to B(t√3, k - t*k). So vector AB is (t√3, k - t*k). Line FB goes from F(0,k) to B(t√3, k - t*k). Vector FB is (t√3 - 0, (k - t*k) - k) = (t√3, - t*k). 

For FB to be perpendicular to AB, their dot product must be zero. So:

AB • FB = (t√3)(t√3) + (k - t*k)(-t*k) = ?

Wait, wait. Wait, vectors AB and FB. Wait, AB is from A to B: (t√3, k - t*k). FB is from F to B: (t√3, -t*k). Their dot product should be zero:

[AB_x * FB_x + AB_y * FB_y] = 0.

So:

[t√3 * t√3] + [(k - t*k) * (-t*k)] = 0.

Compute term by term:

First term: t² * 3.

Second term: -(k - t*k) * t*k = -kt(k - t*k) ?

Wait, expanding:

[(k - t*k)] * (-t*k) = -t*k*(k - t*k)

Let me compute:

= -t*k^2 + t²*k² ?

Wait, maybe better to write:

Let me denote AB vector components as (x1, y1) = (t√3, k - tk)

FB vector components as (x2, y2) = (t√3, -tk)

Dot product: x1*x2 + y1*y2 = 0

Therefore,

(t√3)(t√3) + (k - tk)(-tk) = 0

Which simplifies to:

t² * 3 + (-tk)(k - tk) = 0

Let me expand the second term:

(-tk)(k - tk) = -tk*k + t²*k² = -tk² + t²k²

Thus overall equation:

3t² - tk² + t²k² = 0

Factor terms:

Group terms with t²:

t²(3 + k²) - tk² = 0

Hmm, maybe factor out t?

t[ t(3 + k²) - k² ] = 0

So solutions are either t = 0, which would put B at F, but that might not make sense since B is a distinct point. Or t(3 + k²) - k² = 0 → t = k² / (3 + k²)

So we have t = k² / (3 + k²). Let me keep that in mind.

Now, also, we have the length of FL is given as 2√3. Wait, FL is the distance between F(0,k) and L(√3, 0). Let me compute that distance:

Distance FL = sqrt[(√3 - 0)^2 + (0 - k)^2] = sqrt(3 + k²). According to the problem, this equals 2√3. So:

sqrt(3 + k²) = 2√3 ⇒ square both sides: 3 + k² = 4*3 = 12 ⇒ k² = 9 ⇒ k = ±3. So k is 3 or -3. Since lengths are positive, maybe we can take k = 3 (assuming upward direction). So k = 3. Thus, point F is at (0, 3). 

So now we know k = 3. Therefore, t = (k²)/(3 + k²) = 9/(3 + 9) = 9/12 = 3/4. So t = 3/4.

So coordinates of B are (t√3, k - t*k) = ( (3/4)*√3 , 3 - (3/4)*3 ) = ( (3√3)/4 , 3 - 9/4 ) = ( (3√3)/4 , 3/4 )

So coordinates of B are ( (3√3)/4 , 3/4 )

Now, let me check if this makes sense. Also, need to verify other constraints, like the length of AB and FB, etc.

First, let's confirm FL is indeed 2√3. As before, with k=3, sqrt(3 + 9)=sqrt(12)=2*sqrt(3). Correct.

Now, we need to find z, which is the length of AF. Since A is at (0,0) and F is at (0,3), then AF is vertical line from (0,0) to (0,3). So its length is 3 units. Hence z = 3. Which would correspond to option B. But let me check if there are more steps needed.

Wait, but hold on. Are there any other constraints? For example, the length of AL is given as √3. AL is from A(0,0) to L(√3, 0), which is indeed length √3. So that checks out.

Also, check if line AF is perpendicular to line AL. AL is along x-axis, AF is vertical, so they are perpendicular. Correct.

Another constraint: line FB is perpendicular to line AB. Let me verify that.

Coordinates:

Point A(0,0), B(3√3/4, 3/4), F(0,3).

Vector AB is (3√3/4 - 0, 3/4 - 0) = (3√3/4, 3/4)

Vector FB is B - F = (3√3/4 - 0, 3/4 - 3) = (3√3/4, -9/4)

Dot product of AB and FB is (3√3/4)(3√3/4) + (3/4)(-9/4) 

Calculate first term: (9*3)/16 = 27/16

Second term: -27/16

Total: 27/16 - 27/16 = 0. Perfect! They are perpendicular. So that condition holds.

So far, everything seems consistent. Now, z is the length of AF, which is 3. So answer is B. However, let me check if there's anything else. Let me check if there are other constraints involving y or x, but the question only asks for z. So unless there's something missing here...

Wait, but let me double-check. What about the length of AB? Because y is the length of AB. Let me calculate AB's length. From A(0,0) to B(3√3/4, 3/4):

Length squared is (3√3/4)^2 + (3/4)^2 = (27/16) + (9/16) = 36/16 = 9/4. So length is 3/2. So y = 3/2. Not sure if needed, but since the problem didn't ask for y, so okay.

Similarly, length of FB: from F(0,3) to B(3√3/4, 3/4). Compute distance:

Δx = 3√3/4 - 0 = 3√3/4; Δy = 3/4 - 3 = -9/4.

So squared distance: (3√3/4)^2 + (-9/4)^2 = same as above, 27/16 + 81/16 = 108/16 = 27/4. So length is sqrt(27/4) = 3√3 / 2. So x = 3√3 / 2. Again, not needed for z.

But the problem says nothing about x or y except that they are defined. So our calculation for z is 3. So answer is B. But let me check again if there's a mistake.

Wait, but the answer options include B as 3, so that's possible. But let me think once more.

Is there a possibility that I made an error in assuming coordinates? For instance, taking AL along x-axis. Could there be another configuration?

Alternatively, maybe I should use coordinate system differently. For example, maybe AL isn't along x-axis. But since AF is perpendicular to AL, choosing coordinates accordingly is valid. Also, the perpendicularity conditions were satisfied.

Alternatively, maybe using vectors or trigonometry. Let me think of another approach.

Since AF is perpendicular to AL, and AL has length √3. Also, FL has length 2√3. So triangle AFL? Wait, points A, F, L. Wait, AF is perpendicular to AL. So triangle AFL is right-angled at A. Therefore, by Pythagoras:

FL² = AF² + AL². 

Yes! Because angle at A is right angle. So FL² = AF² + AL². Given that FL is 2√3, AL is √3. So:

(2√3)² = z² + (√3)² ⇒ 4*3 = z² + 3 ⇒ 12 = z² + 3 ⇒ z² = 9 ⇒ z = 3. 

Oh! This is much simpler. So regardless of coordinate system, since AF is perpendicular to AL, triangle AFL is right-angled at A, hence applying Pythagoras directly gives us z = 3. 

This confirms the earlier result. So z is 3. Therefore, answer is B. 

So even without coordinates, recognizing the right triangle gives the solution quickly. 

Therefore, the correct answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ z $, we begin by analyzing the geometric relationships and leveraging the key property of **perpendicularity**. Here’s a structured breakdown:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**

From the problem:

- Points $ A $, $ F $, and $ L $ form a triangle where:
  - $ \overline{AF} \perp \overline{AL} $
  - $ \overline{FL} = 2\sqrt{3} $
  - $ \overline{AL} = \sqrt{3} $

Because $ \angle FAL = 90^\circ $, triangle $ AFL $ is a **right triangle**, right-angled at $ A $. Therefore, we can apply the **Pythagorean Theorem** directly.

---

### **Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**

In triangle $ AFL $, with right angle at $ A $:

$$
(\text{Hypotenuse})^2 = (\text{Leg}_1)^2 + (\text{Leg}_2)^2
$$

Here:
- Hypotenuse: $ FL = 2\sqrt{3} $
- One leg: $ AL = \sqrt{3} $
- Other leg: $ AF = z $

Substitute into the formula:

$$
(2\sqrt{3})^2 = z^2 + (\sqrt{3})^2 \\
4 \cdot 3 = z^2 + 3 \\
12 = z^2 + 3 \\
z^2 = 9 \\
z = \sqrt{9} = 3
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

The value of $ z $, which represents the length of segment $ \overline{AF} $, is:

$$
\boxed{3}
$$
