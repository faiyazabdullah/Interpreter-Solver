MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, we have several angles labeled 1 through 9, and some given measures for angles 1, 2, and 3. We need to find the measure of angle 9. Let me start by visualizing the diagram based on the given constraints. 

First, the problem mentions points A, B, C, D, E with certain lines and parallel conditions. The key information here is that line AB is parallel to line EC. Also, there are points lying on specific lines: point C lies on line DB, and point E lies on line DA. Hmm, so maybe I should sketch a rough diagram to get a better idea. 

Let me note down the given equalities:

- Angle at BAE (Angle(B,A,E)) equals angle 1, which is 58 degrees.
- Angle at EBA (Angle(E,B,A)) equals angle 2, which is 47 degrees.
- Angle at DBE (Angle(D,B,E)) equals angle 3, which is 26 degrees.
- Angle at AEB (Angle(A,E,B)) equals angle 6.
- Angle at BEC (Angle(B,E,C)) equals angle 5.
- Angle at ECB (Angle(E,C,B)) equals angle 4.
- Angle at CED (Angle(C,E,D)) equals angle 7.
- Angle at DCE (Angle(D,C,E)) equals angle 8.
- Angle at EDB (Angle(E,D,B)) equals angle 9.

Also, the parallel condition between AB and EC. Since AB || EC, corresponding angles might come into play here. Additionally, point C is on line DB, and E is on line DA. So perhaps triangle relationships or transversal lines?

Starting with angles 1 and 2. Angle 1 is ∠BAE = 58°, angle 2 is ∠EBA = 47°. These two angles are part of triangle ABE. Wait, because point E is connected to A and B? Or wait, since E lies on DA, then line EA is part of DA. Let me think about the structure.

Since E lies on line DA, so points D, A, E are colinear. Similarly, point C lies on line DB, so points D, B, C are colinear. Therefore, line DA has points D-E-A, and line DB has points D-B-C. So, E is somewhere along DA extended beyond A? Or between D and A? Well, depending on how the diagram is drawn. But since there's a line connecting E to C, as per the parallel lines AB and EC. 

Wait, AB is parallel to EC. So if AB is a line segment, then EC is another line segment parallel to it. Given that E is on DA, and C is on DB. So EC connects E (on DA) to C (on DB). And AB is parallel to EC. So maybe triangle ABC or something similar?

But first, let me focus on triangle ABE. In triangle ABE, we know two angles: angle at A (∠BAE = 58°) and angle at B (∠ABE = 47°). Therefore, the third angle at E (∠AEB) can be calculated. Since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, so:

∠AEB = 180° - 58° - 47° = 75°. Therefore, angle 6, which is ∠AEB, is 75°. So angle 6 is 75°.

Now, looking at angle 3, which is ∠DBE = 26°. This angle is at point B, between points D, B, E. Since point C is on line DB, then line BC is part of DB. So angle ∠DBE is adjacent to angle ∠EBC? Wait, no. If C is on DB, then point C is between D and B? Or is it extended beyond B? Depending on the configuration. But since AB is parallel to EC, and E is on DA, perhaps the position of C affects this.

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle EBD? Let me see. Point E is connected to B, and angle at B is ∠DBE = 26°, which is part of line BD. Since EC is parallel to AB, and AB is connected to point B, so EC would form a transversal with AB. Maybe using alternate interior angles?

Wait, AB || EC. So if we consider line EB as a transversal cutting AB and EC. Then, the corresponding angles would be equal. For example, angle at B (between AB and EB) corresponds to angle at E (between EC and EB). Wait, but angle at B is ∠ABE = 47°, which was given as angle 2. Then, the corresponding angle on EC would be ∠BEC. Wait, but ∠BEC is angle 5? Because angle 5 is ∠BEC, right? Let me check the original list:

Yes, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,E,C)), MeasureOf(angle 5)). So ∠BEC is angle 5. So since AB || EC, and EB is a transversal, then ∠ABE (which is 47°) corresponds to ∠BEC (angle 5). Therefore, angle 5 should also be 47°, because they are corresponding angles. Wait, but that would make angle 5 = 47°, but let me confirm.

Wait, when two lines are cut by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal. Here, AB || EC, and EB is the transversal. So the angle between AB and EB at point B (∠ABE) corresponds to the angle between EC and EB at point E (∠BEC). Therefore, yes, angle 5 (∠BEC) equals angle 2 (∠ABE) which is 47°. So angle 5 is 47°. That seems straightforward.

So angle 5 is 47°. Now, moving on. What else can we do?

Looking back at triangle BEC. In triangle BEC, we know angle at E is 47° (angle 5), and angle at C is ∠ECB, which is angle 4. Let me check if there's more info. Also, since EC is parallel to AB, and AB is connected to point A, maybe there are other angles we can relate.

Wait, earlier we had angle 6 (∠AEB) as 75°, which is angle at E in triangle ABE. Now, point E is connected to C, forming line EC. So angle at E between A and C? Wait, ∠AEB is 75°, and ∠BEC is 47°, so maybe those two angles add up to something? Because if you look at point E, with lines EA, EB, and EC. Wait, but EC is going to point C on DB. So maybe the angles around point E?

At point E, we have angles involving EA, EB, and EC. Let me think. From earlier, angle AEB is 75°, which is between EA and EB. Then, angle BEC is 47°, which is between EB and EC. Therefore, the total angle at E between EA and EC would be 75° + 47° = 122°, assuming these angles are adjacent. However, unless there's another angle involved, like if EC forms another angle with EA. Wait, but maybe there's another way to compute this.

Alternatively, since AB || EC, and EA is a line from E to A (since E is on DA), then EA is part of line DA. So DA is a straight line passing through E and A. So line DA contains points D, E, A. Therefore, line EC is parallel to AB. So if we can find some relationship between triangles or use the fact that EC || AB.

Another approach: Since AB || EC, then the slope of AB is same as EC. But maybe that's too vague. Alternatively, using alternate interior angles. For instance, if we consider line EB intersecting AB and EC, creating alternate interior angles. Wait, earlier we said that ∠ABE = ∠BEC = 47°, which are corresponding angles. But maybe there are other pairs.

Alternatively, let's consider triangle EBD. Wait, angle at B is 26°, which is ∠DBE. So in triangle EBD, we have angle at B as 26°, and maybe other angles?

But to find more angles, we need more information. Let me check if there are any other given angles. We have angle 3 as ∠DBE = 26°, which is already used. Also, angle 1 is ∠BAE = 58°, angle 2 is ∠ABE = 47°, angle 6 is ∠AEB = 75°, angle 5 is ∠BEC = 47°, etc.

Wait, since EC || AB, and DA passes through E, then maybe triangle ABE and triangle ECD or something similar? Not sure yet.

Wait, let's go back to triangle BEC. In triangle BEC, we know angle at E is 47°, angle at B is... Wait, angle at B in triangle BEC is ∠EBC. Wait, but earlier we had ∠ABE = 47°, which is part of angle at B. But point C is on line DB, so ∠EBC is the same as ∠ABE? No, because point C is on DB, so line BC is part of DB. Therefore, ∠EBC is the same as ∠ABE? Wait, if AB is parallel to EC, then maybe ∠EBC is supplementary to some angle?

Wait, let me clarify. At point B, there are multiple lines: BA, BE, and BC. Since C is on DB, then BC is part of line DB. So ∠ABE is between BA and BE, while ∠EBC is between BE and BC. So the entire angle at B between BA and BC would be ∠ABE + ∠EBC. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say. However, we might need to find relations using the parallel lines.

Given AB || EC, and line BE is a transversal. So, as before, ∠ABE (at B) and ∠BEC (at E) are corresponding angles, hence equal. Which gives us ∠BEC = 47°, as established.

Now, focusing on triangle BEC, we have angle at E = 47°, angle at B = ?

Wait, angle at B in triangle BEC is ∠EBC. But how do we find that? Well, if we can find another relation. Since AB || EC, and line BC intersects them. So line BC is a transversal crossing AB and EC. Therefore, the consecutive interior angles would be supplementary. Wait, consecutive interior angles are on the same side of the transversal. So, for example, ∠ABE and ∠EBC would be consecutive interior angles? Wait, no. Let me think again.

If AB || EC, and BC is a transversal. Then, ∠ABE and ∠EBC are on different sides? Wait, AB and EC are parallel. The transversal BC crosses AB at point B and EC at point C. Therefore, the consecutive interior angles would be ∠ABE (on AB) and ∠ECB (on EC). Wait, consecutive interior angles are the ones inside the parallel lines and on the same side of the transversal. So, ∠ABE is on AB, which is one of the parallel lines, and ∠ECB is on EC, the other parallel line. So they are consecutive interior angles, thus their sum should be 180°. 

Therefore, ∠ABE + ∠ECB = 180°. We know ∠ABE is 47°, so ∠ECB = 180° - 47° = 133°. But ∠ECB is angle 4. Therefore, angle 4 is 133°. 

So angle 4 = 133°. Now, in triangle BEC, we have angles at E = 47°, at C = 133°, so the remaining angle at B (∠EBC) can be found. Sum of angles in triangle is 180°, so ∠EBC = 180 - 47 - 133 = 0? Wait, that can't be. Wait, 47 + 133 = 180, so 180 - 180 = 0? That's impossible. There must be a mistake here.

Wait, hold on. If AB || EC, and BC is a transversal, then the consecutive interior angles would be ∠ABE (at B) and ∠ECB (at C). Therefore, ∠ABE + ∠ECB = 180°, so ∠ECB = 180 - 47 = 133°. But that makes angle at C in triangle BEC as 133°, and angle at E as 47°, which sums to 180°, leaving nothing for angle at B. That suggests that my assumption is wrong. Where did I go wrong?

Ah! Wait, maybe I mixed up the angles. Consecutive interior angles are on the same side of the transversal. So if AB || EC, and transversal BC, then the consecutive interior angles would be ∠ABC (if AB and BC were considered) but actually, the transversal is BC, intersecting AB at B and EC at C. Therefore, the angles formed at B and C on the same side of the transversal BC would be ∠ABC and ∠ECB. Wait, but ∠ABC is not directly known. Wait, ∠ABE is part of ∠ABC?

Wait, maybe I need to re-examine the labeling. Let me clarify the points:

- Points D, E, A are colinear (since E lies on DA).
- Points D, B, C are colinear (since C lies on DB).
- AB is parallel to EC.

So line AB is one line, and EC is another line parallel to it. Let me imagine point B connected to A and to E. Wait, but E is on DA. So line DA goes through E, and line DB goes through C. 

Perhaps I made an error in identifying which angles are consecutive interior angles. Let me think again. The transversal is BC, crossing AB at B and EC at C. Therefore, the angles on the same side of the transversal BC would be ∠ABE (at B) and ∠ECB (at C). So these two angles are consecutive interior angles and should be supplementary. Hence, ∠ABE + ∠ECB = 180°, leading to ∠ECB = 180 - 47 = 133°, which is angle 4. But then in triangle BEC, angles are 47°, 133°, and ∠EBC. Adding 47+133=180, so ∠EBC=0°, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be an error in reasoning.

Hmm, this suggests that my identification of the consecutive interior angles is incorrect. Perhaps I confused the transversal? Let me check again. If AB || EC, and BC is a transversal, then the angles formed at B and C would depend on the direction of the transversal. 

Alternatively, maybe the transversal isn't BC but BE? Let me try that. If BE is the transversal, then it cuts AB and EC. So the angles formed would be ∠ABE and ∠BEC. Wait, those are the corresponding angles, which we already determined to be equal, so that's why ∠ABE = ∠BEC = 47°, which works. So that's correct.

But for the consecutive interior angles, if we take BC as the transversal, then maybe the other pair of angles. Let me visualize: AB || EC, with transversal BC. So at point B, the angle between AB and BC is ∠ABC, and at point C, the angle between EC and BC is ∠ECB. Wait, but ∠ABC is not directly given. However, we do know ∠ABE = 47°, which is part of ∠ABC. 

Wait, point E is on DA, and line BE connects B to E. So ∠ABE is part of ∠ABC if C lies on DB. Wait, if C is on DB, then line BC is part of line DB. So, point B is connected to D and C via line DB. Therefore, line BC extends from B through C to D. So ∠ABE is between AB and BE, whereas ∠ABC is between AB and BC. Since E is on DA, BE is a separate line from BC. Therefore, ∠ABE and ∠ABC may not be directly related unless E is aligned with C somehow. 

This seems complicated. Maybe instead of trying to use consecutive interior angles, I need to explore other relationships. Let me recall that angle 3 is ∠DBE = 26°. This angle is at point B, between D, B, E. Since C lies on line DB, then line BC is part of line DB. So ∠DBE is the same as ∠EBD = 26°, which is the angle between BE and BD. But BD is the same as BC because C is on DB. So, ∠EBD is the angle between BE and BC, which would be ∠EBC. Wait, if C is on DB, then line BC is just extending from B to C along DB. Therefore, ∠EBD is the same as ∠EBC. Therefore, ∠EBC = 26°. 

Wait, this is important! So angle 3 is ∠DBE = 26°, which is the angle between D-B-E. Since C is on line DB, then ∠DBE is the same as ∠EBC, meaning that ∠EBC = 26°. Earlier, I thought there was a contradiction, but this resolves it. 

So in triangle BEC, we have angle at B (∠EBC) = 26°, angle at E (∠BEC) = 47°, so the third angle at C (∠ECB) = 180 - 26 - 47 = 107°. Therefore, angle 4 is 107°, not 133° as previously miscalculated. That fixes the inconsistency. Great!

So angle 4 = 107°. Now, moving forward. 

With angle 4 being 107°, which is ∠ECB. Now, since EC || AB, and CB is a transversal, then the alternate interior angles would be ∠ECB and ∠ABC. Wait, alternate interior angles are on opposite sides of the transversal. So if AB || EC and transversal CB, then ∠ECB and ∠ABC are alternate interior angles. Therefore, they are equal. Thus, ∠ABC = ∠ECB = 107°. 

So angle ABC is 107°. Now, angle ABC is at point B, between A, B, C. Let me think about triangle ABC. Wait, but we don't know much about triangle ABC yet. However, we might be able to find other angles.

Earlier, in triangle ABE, we found angle at A (∠BAE) = 58°, angle at B (∠ABE) = 47°, angle at E (∠AEB) = 75°. Now, angle ABC is 107°, which includes angle ABE (47°) and angle EBC (26°). Indeed, 47° + 26° = 73°, which is not 107°. Wait, that contradicts our previous conclusion. What's wrong here?

Hold on, earlier I concluded that ∠ECB = 107°, and therefore ∠ABC = ∠ECB due to alternate interior angles. But according to the sum of angles at point B, ∠ABE (47°) plus ∠EBC (26°) equals 73°, which should be ∠ABC. But according to the alternate interior angles, ∠ABC should be 107°. There's a contradiction here. So where is the mistake?

Let me double-check the alternate interior angles. If AB || EC and transversal CB, then the alternate interior angles would be ∠ECB and ∠ABC. Wait, but ∠ECB is at point C, between E, C, B. And ∠ABC is at point B, between A, B, C. Are these alternate interior angles?

Yes, because the transversal is CB, cutting AB at B and EC at C. Alternate interior angles are on opposite sides of the transversal. So, if AB is above EC, then the alternate interior angles would be ∠ECB (on the lower side of transversal CB) and ∠ABC (on the upper side). Hence, they should be equal. Therefore, ∠ECB = ∠ABC. But earlier calculation gave ∠ECB = 107°, and ∠ABC should be 107°, but according to the angles at point B, ∠ABE + ∠EBC = 47 + 26 = 73°, which is supposed to be ∠ABC. Contradiction again. 

This implies that my assumption about the alternate interior angles is wrong. Why? Let me think again about the positions. If AB is parallel to EC, and transversal CB, then ∠ECB and ∠ABC are indeed alternate interior angles only if the transversal CB crosses AB and EC such that they are on opposite sides. But maybe the orientation is different. 

Alternatively, perhaps ∠ABC is not the alternate interior angle. Let me draw mentally: AB || EC. Transversal CB goes from point C to B. So at point B, the angle between AB and CB is ∠ABC. At point C, the angle between EC and CB is ∠ECB. Since AB || EC, these two angles are on opposite sides of transversal CB, making them alternate interior angles. Therefore, they should be equal. Hence, ∠ABC = ∠ECB. 

But according to the previous calculation, ∠ECB is 107°, and ∠ABC should be 107°, but according to the sum of angles at point B, ∠ABE (47°) + ∠EBC (26°) = 73°, which would mean ∠ABC is 73°, conflicting with 107°. So clearly, there's a mistake here. 

Where is the mistake? Let's retrace steps. Earlier, in triangle BEC, we had angles at E = 47°, at B = 26°, so angle at C = 180 - 47 - 26 = 107°, which is angle 4. So ∠ECB = 107°. According to alternate interior angles, ∠ABC = 107°, but according to the angles at point B, ∠ABE + ∠EBC = 47 + 26 = 73°, implying ∠ABC = 73°. This discrepancy means that one of the assumptions is wrong. 

Possibly, the assumption that ∠EBC is 26°. Let me revisit that. The given constraint says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D, B, E)), MeasureOf(angle 3)), which is ∠DBE = angle 3 = 26°. Since point C is on line DB, then ∠DBE is the same as ∠EBC. Is this true? 

Wait, point D, B, C are colinear. So line DB passes through B and C. So ∠DBE is the angle between D-B-E. Since C is on line DB, then line BE is a ray starting at B and going towards E. So ∠DBE is the angle between D-B-E, which is the same as the angle between BE and BD. But since C is on BD, then BD is the same as BC extended. So ∠DBE is the same as ∠EBC. Wait, if you imagine standing at point B, facing from D to B to E, then ∠DBE is the angle between BD and BE. Since C is on BD, then ∠EBC is the same as ∠DBE, because both are angles at B between BE and BD/BC. Yes, so ∠EBC = ∠DBE = 26°. So that's correct. 

Then, why does the alternate interior angle give a different value? It must be that my understanding of the alternate interior angles is flawed. Let me think again: AB || EC, and transversal CB. So, the alternate interior angles would be ∠ABC (at B) and ∠ECB (at C). But if ∠ECB is 107°, then ∠ABC should also be 107°, but ∠ABC is composed of ∠ABE + ∠EBC = 47 + 26 = 73°. This suggests that either ∠ECB is not 107°, or my calculation of it is wrong. 

Wait, in triangle BEC, we had angles at E = 47°, at B = 26°, so angle at C is 180 - 47 - 26 = 107°, which is correct. So that part is okay. So why is ∠ABC not equal to ∠ECB? 

Maybe the transversal is not CB but BE? Let me try that. If BE is the transversal, then it intersects AB at B and EC at E. So the alternate interior angles would be ∠ABE and ∠BEC. Which are equal, as we already established (both 47°). That's fine. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another transversal. Let's consider line AE, which goes from A to E, since E is on DA. Line AE is part of DA, and since AB || EC, maybe there's a relation here. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider triangle ABE and triangle EBC, or other triangles. 

Wait, since AB || EC, and AE is a line from A to E, then maybe triangle ABE and some other triangle are similar or congruent? 

Alternatively, since AB || EC, the slopes are equal, but without coordinates, it's hard to use coordinate geometry. 

Let me think differently. Since we have angles at various points, maybe we can find more angles in other parts of the diagram. 

We know angle 6 is ∠AEB = 75°, angle 5 is ∠BEC = 47°. At point E, we have angles around it. Specifically, angle AEB is 75°, angle BEC is 47°, and possibly others. If we can determine other angles at E, that could help. 

At point E, the angles around it include ∠AEB (75°), ∠BEC (47°), and potentially others. If line EC is parallel to AB, and E is on DA, then line EC is parallel to AB, and line EA is part of DA. So, maybe there's a transversal involving EA and EC? 

Wait, if we consider line EC parallel to AB, and line EA intersecting them. So, line EA intersects AB at A and EC at E. Therefore, the corresponding angles would be ∠BAE (at A) and ∠AEC (at E). Wait, ∠BAE is 58°, so ∠AEC should also be 58°, because they're corresponding angles. 

But ∠AEC is the angle at E between A and C. Let me see: at point E, between A and C. So, ∠AEC would be part of the angles at E. We know ∠AEB is 75°, and ∠BEC is 47°, so adding those gives ∠AEC = ∠AEB + ∠BEC = 75° + 47° = 122°? Wait, no. If you have point E with lines EA, EB, and EC, then depending on their arrangement, the angles could add up differently. 

Wait, if line EC is parallel to AB, and line EA intersects them, then ∠BAE and ∠AEC are corresponding angles, so ∠AEC = ∠BAE = 58°. But earlier, from the sum of ∠AEB (75°) and ∠BEC (47°), we get 122°, which would imply that ∠AEC is 122°, conflicting with the corresponding angle theorem. This suggests a contradiction, indicating a mistake in assumptions. 

Wait, this is very confusing. Let me try to resolve this. If line EA intersects AB at A and EC at E, then ∠BAE and ∠AEC are corresponding angles, so they should be equal. Hence, ∠AEC = ∠BAE = 58°. However, from the earlier calculation, ∠AEB + ∠BEC = 75° + 47° = 122°, which would suggest that ∠AEC is 122°, which conflicts with the corresponding angles. 

This implies that my earlier assumption that ∠AEB + ∠BEC = ∠AEC is incorrect. Why? Because points A, E, and C are not necessarily collinear. Wait, but line EC is parallel to AB, and line EA is a transversal. So ∠BAE and ∠AEC are corresponding angles, so they should be equal. Therefore, ∠AEC = 58°. But how does this fit with the other angles at E?

At point E, the angles around it include ∠AEB (75°), ∠BEC (47°), and ∠AEC (58°). But these three angles are not overlapping; they might overlap or be adjacent. Wait, if line EC is parallel to AB, and line EA goes from E to A, then ∠AEC is the angle between EA and EC. Meanwhile, ∠AEB is the angle between EA and EB, and ∠BEC is the angle between EB and EC. So, if you imagine at point E, with rays EA, EB, and EC, then ∠AEB + ∠BEC = ∠AEC. So, ∠AEC = ∠AEB + ∠BEC = 75° + 47° = 122°, but according to corresponding angles, ∠AEC should be 58°. This contradiction indicates a fundamental flaw in my reasoning. 

What's wrong here? Let me think again about the correspondence. If AB || EC, and EA is a transversal, then the corresponding angles would be ∠BAE (at A) and ∠AEC (at E). But ∠AEC is the angle between EA and EC. However, if line EA is not intersecting EC at E, but rather, EC is a separate line. Wait, EC starts at E and goes to C. So, line EC starts at E and goes to C, while line EA starts at E and goes to A. So, at point E, lines EA and EC meet, forming ∠AEC. So, ∠AEC is the angle between EA and EC. 

Meanwhile, ∠BAE is the angle between BA and AE. Since AB || EC, and EA is a transversal, then ∠BAE and ∠AEC should be corresponding angles. Therefore, ∠AEC = ∠BAE = 58°. But according to the sum of ∠AEB and ∠BEC, it's 75° + 47° = 122°, which suggests ∠AEC = 122°. This contradiction means there's a mistake in the assumption that ∠AEB + ∠BEC = ∠AEC. 

Why is this happening? Because ∠AEB and ∠BEC are not necessarily adjacent to each other at point E. Wait, if you have point E with lines EA, EB, and EC, then depending on the order of the points, these angles could be arranged differently. For example, if EB is between EA and EC, then ∠AEB + ∠BEC = ∠AEC. But if EB is not between them, the sum wouldn't apply. 

So, perhaps EB is not between EA and EC? How can that be? Let me try to imagine the diagram. 

Since AB || EC, and E is on DA, which is a line extending from D through E to A. So, line DA has points D, E, A. Line DB has points D, B, C. Point C is on DB. Line EC is parallel to AB. 

Assuming AB is horizontal for visualization. Let me try to sketch mentally: 

- Point A is on the left, D is to the left of A, and E is further left on DA. 
- Point B is somewhere such that AB is horizontal (parallel to EC). 
- Point C is on DB, so extending from D through B to C. 
- Line EC is parallel to AB, so it must have the same slope. 

At point E, line EC goes from E to C, which is on DB. Line EA goes from E to A. So, at point E, we have lines EA and EC. The angle between them is ∠AEC. 

Also, line EB goes from E to B. So, at point E, we have three lines: EA, EB, and EC. Depending on the arrangement, EB could be between EA and EC or not. 

If ∠AEB is 75°, and ∠BEC is 47°, then depending on the order of the lines, these angles could add up to ∠AEC or not. 

If EB is between EA and EC, then ∠AEC = ∠AEB + ∠BEC = 75° + 47° = 122°, but this contradicts the corresponding angles giving ∠AEC = 58°. 

Alternatively, if EB is not between EA and EC, then ∠AEC would be |∠AEB - ∠BEC| or something else. But how? 

This suggests that my initial assumption about the correspondence of angles is wrong. Let me reconsider the corresponding angles. 

If AB || EC, and EA is a transversal, then the corresponding angles would be ∠BAE (at A) and ∠AEC (at E). But for these to be corresponding, the transversal EA would need to intersect AB at A and EC at E. So, ∠BAE and ∠AEC are on the same side of the transversal EA. 

However, if line EC is parallel to AB, and EA is a transversal, then ∠BAE and ∠AEC are indeed corresponding angles, hence equal. So ∠AEC = ∠BAE = 58°. This suggests that ∠AEC = 58°, but earlier calculation from angles at E gives 122°, which is a contradiction. 

The resolution must be that the assumption that EB is between EA and EC is incorrect. Instead, EB is not between EA and EC, so the angles ∠AEB and ∠BEC do not add up to ∠AEC. Instead, they form a linear pair or something else. 

For example, if line EB is on the opposite side of EC relative to EA, then ∠AEB and ∠BEC could be adjacent in a different way. Let me try to think of it as follows: 

At point E, line EA goes to A, line EC goes to C, and line EB goes to B. If AB || EC, then the direction of EC is the same as AB. Assuming AB is horizontal, EC is also horizontal. Line EA is from E to A, which is to the right (since E is on DA, and A is to the right of E). Line EC is horizontal, so from E, it goes to C, which is in the direction of EC's slope. 

If AB is horizontal, then EC is also horizontal. So, from point E, line EC is horizontal, extending in some direction. Line EA goes from E to A, which is to the right (assuming A is to the right of E on DA). So, at point E, line EA is to the right, and line EC is horizontal, but in which direction? Depends on the position of C. 

Since AB || EC, and AB is from A to B. Let's assume AB is horizontal, so B is to the right of A. Then, EC must also be horizontal. Since E is on DA, and line EC is horizontal, then C must be to the right or left of E, depending on the direction of EC. 

If AB is horizontal, and EC is parallel to AB, then EC is also horizontal. Let me assume that EC goes to the right from E. So, from E, line EC goes horizontally to the right. Line EA goes from E to A, which is to the right (since E is on DA, and A is on the same line). So, both EC and EA are going to the right from E. This would mean that at point E, lines EA and EC are in the same direction, making ∠AEC = 0°, which is impossible. 

Alternatively, if EC goes to the left from E. So, line EC goes from E to the left, while line EA goes from E to the right (towards A). Then, at point E, lines EA and EC are in opposite directions, forming a straight line, which would make ∠AEC = 180°, but this contradicts the corresponding angle of 58°. 

This suggests that my mental model is flawed. Perhaps the direction of EC depends on the position of C. Since C is on DB, and AB || EC, the direction of EC must be consistent with AB. 

Maybe it's time to switch approaches. Let me try to calculate angle 9, which is ∠EDB, which is ∠E-D-B. Wait, no, angle 9 is ∠E-D-B? Wait, the original statement says: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(E, D, B)), MeasureOf(angle 9)). So ∠EDB, which is the angle at D between E, D, B. 

Wait, point D is connected to B and E. Since C is on DB, and E is on DA. So, line DE is part of DA (since E is on DA). Wait, no: D is connected to A and B. Wait, D is a point such that E is on DA, and C is on DB. So, line DA has points D, E, A; line DB has points D, B, C. So, point D is connected to A and B. 

Thus, angle ∠EDB is the angle at D between E, D, B. This is angle 9. To find this angle, we need to consider triangle EDB or other figures involving D. 

To find ∠EDB, we might need to find other angles in triangle EDB. We know ∠DBE = 26° (angle 3), and if we can find another angle in the triangle, we can calculate ∠EDB. 

In triangle EDB, we have angle at B (∠DBE) = 26°, and we need to find angle at D (∠EDB). To find this, we need to know the third angle at E (∠DEB). 

So, if we can find ∠DEB, then ∠EDB = 180° - 26° - ∠DEB. 

How to find ∠DEB? Let's think about it. 

At point E, we have several angles. Earlier, we had issues with calculating ∠AEC, but let's try again. If AB || EC, and EA is a transversal, then ∠BAE = ∠AEC = 58°. So ∠AEC = 58°. 

Now, ∠AEC is the angle at E between A and C. This angle is composed of ∠AEB and ∠BEC if EB is between EA and EC. But earlier, this led to a contradiction. Let me assume that ∠AEC = 58°, and see if that helps. 

If ∠AEC = 58°, and ∠BEC = 47°, then ∠AEB = ∠AEC - ∠BEC = 58° - 47° = 11°. But earlier, we calculated ∠AEB as 75°, which contradicts this. 

Alternatively, if ∠AEB = ∠AEC + ∠BEC, then 75° = 58° + 47° = 105°, which is also not matching. 

This suggests that my assumption about the corresponding angles is incorrect. Perhaps the corresponding angles are not ∠BAE and ∠AEC, but something else. 

Wait, if AB || EC, and EA is a transversal, then the corresponding angles would be ∠BAE and ∠AEC, but only if the transversal EA intersects AB at A and EC at E. But if line EC is parallel to AB, and line EA intersects AB at A and EC at E, then ∠BAE and ∠AEC are corresponding angles. But this requires that line EA intersects EC at E, which it does. So this should be valid. 

But why is there a contradiction? Let me calculate ∠AEC using this. If ∠AEC = 58°, and we know ∠BEC = 47°, then ∠AEB = ∠AEC - ∠BEC = 58° - 47° = 11°, but earlier calculation from triangle ABE gave ∠AEB = 75°. This is a clear contradiction. 

This suggests that there is a fundamental error in the setup or in the given constraints. However, since this is a problem-solving question, there must be a solution. Let me try to proceed differently. 

Let me summarize what I have so far:

- In triangle ABE: ∠BAE = 58°, ∠ABE = 47°, so ∠AEB = 75°.
- In triangle BEC: ∠BEC = 47° (corresponding angle), ∠EBC = 26° (from angle 3), so ∠ECB = 107°.
- From alternate interior angles, ∠ECB = ∠ABC = 107°, but this contradicts ∠ABC = ∠ABE + ∠EBC = 47 + 26 = 73°.

This suggests that there is an error in the alternate interior angles assumption. Perhaps the transversal is not CB but BE? Let me try that. If BE is the transversal, then it intersects AB at B and EC at E. The alternate interior angles would be ∠ABE and ∠BEC, which are equal, as we already have (47° = 47°). This checks out. 

Now, for the other transversals. Let's consider line DC, which is part of DB (since C is on DB). Line DC is part of DB, and since AB || EC, maybe there's a relation here. 

Alternatively, since EC || AB, and DA contains E, and DB contains C, maybe quadrilateral AECB is a trapezoid? But not sure. 

Let me try to find ∠EDB (angle 9). In triangle EDB, we have ∠DBE = 26°, and we need to find ∠EDB. If I can find ∠DEB, then ∠EDB = 180 - 26 - ∠DEB. 

To find ∠DEB, let's look at point E. At point E, we have angles involving lines EA, EB, and ED (since D is connected to E via DA). 

From earlier, we have ∠AEB = 75°, and ∠BEC = 47°. If we can relate these to ∠DEB. 

Line ED is part of DA, since E is on DA. So, ED is the extension of DA from E to D. So, at point E, line ED is in the opposite direction of EA. So, if EA goes from E to A, then ED goes from E to D, which is in the opposite direction. 

So, at point E, the line ED is opposite to EA. So, if ∠AEB is the angle between EA and EB, and ∠DEB is the angle between ED and EB, then ∠DEB = 180° - ∠AEB, because ED is a straight line from E through A. 

Wait, if ED is in the opposite direction of EA, then the angle between ED and EB is supplementary to the angle between EA and EB. So, ∠DEB = 180° - ∠AEB = 180° - 75° = 105°. 

If this is correct, then in triangle EDB, ∠DEB = 105°, ∠DBE = 26°, so ∠EDB = 180 - 105 - 26 = 49°. Therefore, angle 9 is 49°, which is option C. 

Let me verify this logic. 

At point E, line ED is in the opposite direction of EA. So, if you imagine standing at E, facing along EA towards A, then ED is behind you, in the opposite direction. The angle between ED and EB would be the supplement of the angle between EA and EB. 

Yes, because ED and EA are opposite directions, so the angle between ED and EB is 180° minus the angle between EA and EB. Hence, ∠DEB = 180° - ∠AEB = 180 - 75 = 105°. 

Then, in triangle EDB, angles are ∠DEB = 105°, ∠DBE = 26°, so ∠EDB = 180 - 105 - 26 = 49°. 

This matches option C, 49°. 

Let me check if this aligns with other parts of the diagram. If ∠EDB = 49°, then that is angle 9, which is the answer. 

But let me ensure that this is consistent with other parts. For example, if ∠DEB = 105°, then what is the relation to other angles? 

At point E, ∠DEB = 105°, and we also have ∠BEC = 47°, and ∠AEB = 75°. Let me see if these angles add up properly. 

If ∠DEB = 105°, and ∠BEC = 47°, then the angle between ED and EC would be ∠DEB - ∠BEC = 105° - 47° = 58°. Which would be ∠DEC. 

But since AB || EC, and DE is part of DA, which contains E. If AB || EC, and DE is part of DA, then ∠DEC would correspond to some angle in AB. 

Alternatively, ∠DEC is the angle at E between D and C, which is 58°, and since AB || EC, and DE is a transversal, this might correspond to some angle. 

But this is getting complex, but since the calculation for angle 9 leads to 49°, and this matches option C, and the steps seem logical, I will go with this. 

Therefore, the measure of ∠9 is 49°, which is option C.
