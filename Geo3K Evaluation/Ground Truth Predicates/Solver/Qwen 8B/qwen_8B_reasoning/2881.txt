Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, we have triangle ABC with some points and lines, and we need to find EG, given that G is the incenter of triangle ABC. The answer choices are A. 4, B. 5, C. 12, D. 13. Let's start breaking down the information.

First, the given lengths: Length of line CG is 13, and length of BC is 12. Also, there are several perpendicularity conditions involving point G and lines connected to points D, E, F. Points D, E, F lie on specific lines: D is on AC, E is on BA, F is on BC. Also, lines GD, GF, GE are each perpendicular to DC, FC, and EA respectively. Wait, no—let me check again. Perpendicular(Line(G,D), Line(D,C)) means that GD is perpendicular to DC. Similarly for the others: GF is perpendicular to FC, and GE is perpendicular to EA. 

So, G is a point such that it forms right angles with those segments. But also, G is the incenter of triangle ABC. The incenter is the intersection of angle bisectors and is equidistant from all sides. However, here we have these perpendiculars. Maybe these perpendiculars relate to the inradius or something else?

Wait, but first, maybe I should recall that the incenter has coordinates determined by angle bisectors. Alternatively, since we have coordinates involved (as per the points lying on lines), perhaps coordinate geometry can help here. Let me consider setting up coordinates for triangle ABC.

Let me assign coordinates to make things easier. Let me assume coordinates for triangle ABC. Since BC is 12 units long, and CG is 13 units. Let me place point B at (0,0) and point C at (12,0). Then BC is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (12,0). Now, point G is somewhere such that CG = 13. Wait, but if C is at (12,0), then the distance from C to G is 13. So, G lies on a circle centered at C with radius 13. But also, G is the incenter. Hmm.

But before that, let me think about the other constraints. There are points D, E, F on lines AC, BA, and BC respectively. And GD ⊥ DC, GF ⊥ FC, GE ⊥ EA. So, for example, GD is perpendicular to DC. That suggests that D lies on AC, and GD is perpendicular to DC. Similarly for the others. 

Since D is on AC, and GD is perpendicular to DC. Therefore, GD is the altitude from G to DC? Wait, but DC is part of AC. Wait, DC is a segment from D to C, which is on AC. So, if D is on AC, then DC is just a segment from D to C. So GD is perpendicular to DC. Which would mean that GD is perpendicular to the line AC? Wait, because DC is a subset of AC. If D is on AC, then DC is a segment of AC. Therefore, if GD is perpendicular to DC, then GD is perpendicular to AC. Similarly, GF is perpendicular to FC, which is part of BC. Since F is on BC, so FC is a segment from F to C, which is part of BC. So GF is perpendicular to BC. Similarly, GE is perpendicular to EA, which is part of BA. So GE is perpendicular to BA.

Therefore, G is a point such that:

- From G, draw a line to D on AC, such that GD is perpendicular to AC.

- From G, draw a line to F on BC, such that GF is perpendicular to BC.

- From G, draw a line to E on BA, such that GE is perpendicular to BA.

Additionally, G is the incenter of triangle ABC. 

So, the incenter is located at the intersection of the angle bisectors. However, here, the point G also satisfies those three perpendiculars. Therefore, perhaps these perpendiculars correspond to the distances from G to the sides? Because the incenter is equidistant to all sides. Wait, but the inradius is the distance from the incenter to each side. But here, GD is perpendicular to AC, so GD is the distance from G to AC. Similarly, GF is the distance from G to BC, and GE is the distance from G to AB. Since G is the incenter, those distances should be equal. Hence, GD = GF = GE = r, the inradius.

But wait, the problem says that CG = 13 and BC = 12. So, perhaps we can use coordinates to model this.

Let me proceed with coordinates. Let me set coordinates as follows:

Let’s fix coordinate system:

Let me take B at (0, 0), C at (12, 0), so BC is along x-axis. Let me denote coordinates:

Let’s suppose coordinates:

Let’s let B = (0, 0), C = (12, 0). Let’s denote A as (p, q), but we might need more info. However, since we know CG = 13, and G is the incenter.

Alternatively, maybe we can find coordinates of G using incenter formula. In general, the incenter coordinates can be found as weighted average based on side lengths. But we might need more information about the triangle. However, we don’t know AB or AC. Wait, but maybe we can find relations using the given data.

Also, note that the incenter (G) has distances to the sides equal to the inradius. Moreover, since GD is perpendicular to AC, GF perpendicular to BC, GE perpendicular to AB. So GD, GF, GE are the lengths of the perpendiculars from G to the respective sides. Thus, they should all equal the inradius r. Therefore, GD = GF = GE = r.

Moreover, since GF is perpendicular to BC, which is horizontal (from earlier setup), GF is vertical. Since BC is horizontal, GF being perpendicular to BC implies GF is vertical. Therefore, the foot of the perpendicular from G to BC is F. Similarly, the foot of perpendicular from G to AC is D, and foot of perpendicular from G to AB is E.

But since G is the incenter, those feet of the perpendiculars are the points where the incircle touches the sides. Wait, yes! The incenter is the center of the incircle, which touches each side at exactly one point. Those touch points are the feet of the perpendiculars from the incenter to each side. Therefore, D, E, F are the touch points of the incircle with AC, AB, and BC respectively. Therefore, their positions can be determined based on standard incircle touch points.

In that case, the lengths from the vertices to the touch points are known. For example, in triangle ABC, the length from vertex A to touch point on BC is (AB + AC - BC)/2. Wait, no. Let me recall: the lengths from the vertices to the touch points are s - opposite side, where s is semiperimeter.

Yes, the formula is:

If the incircle touches BC at D', AC at E', and AB at F', then BD' = BF' = s - AC,

CD' = CE' = s - AB,

AF' = AE' = s - BC.

Where s = (AB + BC + AC)/2.

But in our problem, the points D, E, F are the same as those touch points? Well, according to the problem statement, D lies on AC, E on BA, F on BC. So D corresponds to the touch point on AC, E on AB, F on BC. Therefore, their positions are determined by the above formulas.

However, how does this help us? Well, if we can find the coordinates of G, then we can compute EG. But we need to find coordinates of G, which requires knowing coordinates of A, B, C, or at least some relations between them.

Given that BC = 12, and CG = 13. Wait, CG is the distance from C to G. Since G is the incenter, which lies inside the triangle. But if CG = 13, and BC = 12, then that seems problematic because in a typical triangle, the distance from a vertex to the incenter is less than the length of the side? Not necessarily. It depends on the triangle. For example, in a very skewed triangle, maybe. But let's see.

But maybe we can use coordinates. Let me attempt to proceed with coordinates.

Let me denote coordinates:

Let me take B at (0,0), C at (12,0). Let me denote A as (x,y). Then, coordinates of incenter G can be computed as:

The incenter coordinates are given by ( (aAx + bBx + cCx ) / (a+b+c), (aAy + bBy + cCy ) / (a+b+c) ), where a, b, c are lengths of sides opposite to A, B, C. Wait, actually, formula is weighted by lengths of sides. Specifically, the incenter coordinates are ( (a*A_x + b*B_x + c*C_x)/(a+b+c), similar for y-coordinates ). Wait, no, the formula is weighted by the lengths of the sides adjacent to each vertex. Wait, more accurately, the incenter coordinates can be calculated as:

If the triangle has vertices at A(x_A, y_A), B(x_B, y_B), C(x_C, y_C), and the lengths of the sides opposite to A, B, C are a, b, c respectively (so a = |BC|, b = |AC|, c = |AB|), then the incenter (I_x, I_y) is given by:

I_x = (a x_A + b x_B + c x_C) / (a + b + c),

I_y = (a y_A + b y_B + c y_C) / (a + b + c).

Wait, no, actually, it's weighted by the lengths of the sides adjacent to each vertex. Wait, let me confirm. The incenter coordinates can be calculated as:

If the sides opposite to A, B, C are of lengths a, b, c, then the incenter is ( (a x_A + b x_B + c x_C)/(a + b + c), ... )

No, actually, the formula is weighted by the lengths of the sides adjacent to each vertex. Wait, confusion arises. Let me look it up mentally. The incenter coordinates can be found using the formula:

I_x = (a x_A + b x_B + c x_C) / (a + b + c),

where a, b, c are lengths of BC, AC, AB respectively. Wait, no, that's incorrect. Actually, the formula uses the lengths of the sides opposite to the respective vertices. Wait, let me think again.

Actually, the formula is:

If the triangle has side lengths a, b, c opposite to vertices A, B, C respectively, then the incenter coordinates are:

( (a x_A + b x_B + c x_C)/(a + b + c), (a y_A + b y_B + c y_C)/(a + b + c) )

Wait, no. Wait, the weights are actually proportional to the lengths of the sides adjacent to each vertex. Wait, no, the formula for incenter is weighted by the lengths of the sides. Wait, another way: the incenter can be expressed as a weighted average of the vertices, with weights equal to the lengths of the sides opposite to the respective vertices. Wait, I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, since in barycentric coordinates, the incenter has coordinates proportional to a, b, c. But converting to Cartesian coordinates... Maybe it's better to use vector approach.

Alternatively, since I know coordinates of B and C, and need to find coordinates of A, but I don't know A yet. However, we do know that the distance from C to G is 13. Let me try to express G's coordinates in terms of A's coordinates.

Let me define variables:

Let me denote:

Coordinates:

B = (0, 0)

C = (12, 0)

Let me let A = (p, q). Then, AB = sqrt( (p - 0)^2 + (q - 0)^2 ) = sqrt(p² + q² )

AC = sqrt( (p - 12)^2 + q² )

BC = 12.

Then, the incenter coordinates (G_x, G_y) are given by:

G_x = (a*A_x + b*B_x + c*C_x ) / (a + b + c),

where a = BC = 12,

b = AC = sqrt( (p - 12)^2 + q² ),

c = AB = sqrt( p² + q² ).

Similarly,

G_x = [a*p + b*0 + c*12 ] / (a + b + c )

G_y = [a*q + b*0 + c*0 ] / (a + b + c )

= [a q ] / (a + b + c )

So, G_x = [12p + c * 12 ] / (a + b + c )

Wait, no:

Wait, the formula is:

In barycentric coordinates, the incenter is (a : b : c). Therefore, the Cartesian coordinates are (a x_A + b x_B + c x_C ) / (a + b + c ), etc.

But here, a, b, c are the lengths of BC, AC, AB respectively. Wait, no, in barycentric coordinates, the incenter has trilinear coordinates 1 : 1 : 1, but converted to cartesian, it's weighted by the lengths of the sides.

Wait, sorry, perhaps my confusion comes from different notations. Let me refer to standard formula.

The coordinates of the incenter can be calculated as:

If the triangle has vertices A(x_A, y_A), B(x_B, y_B), C(x_C, y_C), and the lengths of the sides opposite to A, B, C are a, b, c respectively, then the incenter (I_x, I_y) is:

I_x = (a x_A + b x_B + c x_C) / (a + b + c),

I_y = (a y_A + b y_B + c y_C) / (a + b + c).

Wait, but here, a is the length of BC, which is opposite to A; b is length of AC, opposite to B; c is length of AB, opposite to C. Wait, no, standard notation is usually a = BC, b = AC, c = AB. Wait, no, standard notation is a = BC, b = AC, c = AB? Or is it a = BC, b = AC, c = AB? Wait, standardly, in triangle ABC, a is the length of BC, b is the length of AC, and c is the length of AB. Wait, no, standard notation is a = BC, b = AC, c = AB? No, typically, a is the side opposite vertex A, which is BC. So, yes, a = |BC|, b = |AC|, c = |AB|. Therefore, the formula for incenter coordinates would be:

I_x = (a x_A + b x_B + c x_C) / (a + b + c )

Wait, no, that can't be. Because if you have weights corresponding to the lengths of the sides opposite to the respective vertices. Wait, perhaps the formula is:

I_x = (a x_A + b x_B + c x_C) / (a + b + c )

But I think that's not correct. Wait, let me check with an example. Suppose we have an equilateral triangle with coordinates A(0,0), B(1,0), C(0.5, sqrt(3)/2). Then, the incenter is at centroid, which is ((0 + 1 + 0.5)/3, (0 + 0 + sqrt(3)/2)/3 ) = (1.5/3, sqrt(3)/6 ) = (0.5, sqrt(3)/6 ). Now, using the formula:

Here, a = BC = length from B to C: sqrt( (0.5 - 1)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)^2 ) = sqrt(0.25 + 3/4 ) = sqrt(1) = 1. Similarly, b = AC = same as BC, so 1. c = AB = 1. So, a = b = c = 1. Then, I_x = (a x_A + b x_B + c x_C ) / (a + b + c ) = (1*0 + 1*1 + 1*0.5 ) / (1+1+1 ) = (0 + 1 + 0.5)/3 = 1.5 / 3 = 0.5. Correct. Similarly I_y = (a y_A + b y_B + c y_C ) / 3 = (1*0 + 1*0 + 1*(sqrt(3)/2 )) / 3 = sqrt(3)/6. Correct. So the formula works. Therefore, the formula is indeed:

I_x = (a x_A + b x_B + c x_C ) / (a + b + c )

I_y = (a y_A + b y_B + c y_C ) / (a + b + c )

Where a = |BC|, b = |AC|, c = |AB|.

So, applying this to our case:

We have:

a = |BC| = 12

b = |AC| = sqrt( (p - 12)^2 + q^2 )

c = |AB| = sqrt( p^2 + q^2 )

Thus, coordinates of G (incenter):

G_x = [ a x_A + b x_B + c x_C ] / (a + b + c ) = [12*p + b*0 + c*12 ] / (12 + b + c )

G_y = [ a y_A + b y_B + c y_C ] / (a + b + c ) = [12*q + b*0 + c*0 ] / (12 + b + c ) = (12q) / (12 + b + c )

Now, we also know that the distance from C to G is 13. Point C is at (12, 0). So, coordinates of G are (G_x, G_y). So, distance CG squared is:

( G_x - 12 )² + ( G_y - 0 )² = 13² = 169.

So, substituting G_x and G_y:

[ ( [12p + 12c ] / (12 + b + c ) - 12 ) ]² + [ 12q / (12 + b + c ) ]² = 169.

This looks complicated. Perhaps there's another way. Since we also have the fact that the inradius r is equal to GD = GF = GE. Additionally, the inradius can be calculated as area / semiperimeter.

But maybe we can find expressions for r and relate them.

Alternatively, since GD is the distance from G to AC, which is equal to r. Also, GF is the distance from G to BC, which is also r. Since BC is the base on x-axis from (0,0) to (12,0), the distance from G to BC is simply the y-coordinate of G. Because BC is along x-axis, so the distance from any point (x, y) to BC is |y|. Since G is inside the triangle, y > 0, so distance is G_y = r. Therefore, from earlier expression:

G_y = 12q / (12 + b + c ) = r.

Also, the inradius r = area / semiperimeter.

Semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = (12 + b + c)/2.

Area can be calculated via coordinates. Using coordinates of A(p,q), B(0,0), C(12,0). Area is |(Ax(By - Cy) + Bx(Cy - Ay) + Cx(Ay - By))/2 | = | p*(0 - 0) + 0*(0 - q) + 12*(q - 0)| / 2 = |12q| / 2 = 6q. Assuming q > 0.

Hence, r = area / semiperimeter = 6q / [ (12 + b + c)/2 ] = 12q / (12 + b + c ). Which matches G_y. Therefore, that checks out.

So, r = G_y = 12q/(12 + b + c )

But also, we have the distance from G to C is 13. So, let's write that equation:

Distance from G to C: sqrt( (G_x - 12)^2 + (G_y)^2 ) = 13.

Square both sides:

( G_x - 12 )² + G_y² = 169.

Substituting G_x and G_y:

G_x = [12p + 12c ] / (12 + b + c )

So, G_x - 12 = [12p + 12c - 12*(12 + b + c ) ] / (12 + b + c )

Compute numerator:

12p + 12c - 12*(12 + b + c ) = 12p + 12c - 144 - 12b - 12c = 12p - 144 - 12b = 12(p - b - 12 )

Wait, let me recompute:

Original numerator:

12p + 12c - 12*(12 + b + c )

Expand the subtraction:

12p + 12c - 12*12 - 12*b - 12*c = 12p + 12c - 144 - 12b - 12c = 12p - 144 - 12b.

Factor 12: 12(p - b - 12 )

Wait, no, 12p - 12b - 144 = 12(p - b - 12). Yes.

Therefore, G_x - 12 = [12(p - b - 12)] / denominator, where denominator is (12 + b + c )

So, putting back into the equation:

( G_x - 12 )² + G_y² = [ 12² (p - b - 12 )² ] / (12 + b + c )² + [ (12q )² ] / (12 + b + c )² = [ 144 (p - b - 12 )² + 144 q² ] / (denominator)^2 = 169.

Multiply both sides by denominator squared:

144 [ (p - b - 12 )² + q² ] = 169 (12 + b + c )².

Hmm, this seems too abstract. Perhaps there's another relation we can use. Recall that b = |AC| = sqrt( (p - 12)^2 + q^2 )

And c = |AB| = sqrt( p² + q² )

So, let me denote:

Let me write b² = (p - 12)^2 + q² 

and c² = p² + q² 

Also, note that (p - b - 12 )² + q² ?

Wait, expanding (p - b - 12 )² + q²:

Let me expand (p - b - 12 )²:

= (p - 12 - b )² = (p - 12)^2 - 2b(p - 12 ) + b² 

Adding q² gives:

(p - 12)^2 - 2b(p - 12 ) + b² + q² 

But note that b² + q² = (p - 12)^2 + q² + q² ? No, wait:

Wait, b² = (p - 12)^2 + q² → so b² + q² = (p - 12)^2 + 2q² ?

Not sure. Let me substitute:

From b² = (p - 12)^2 + q² ⇒ (p - 12)^2 = b² - q² 

So, substituting back into the previous expression:

(p - 12)^2 - 2b(p - 12 ) + b² + q² 

= (b² - q² ) - 2b(p - 12 ) + b² + q² 

= b² - q² + b² + q² - 2b(p - 12 )

= 2b² - 2b(p - 12 )

= 2b [ b - (p - 12 ) ]

Therefore, the entire left-hand side becomes:

144 * 2b [ b - (p - 12 ) ] = 144 * 2b [ b - p + 12 ] 

So:

Left side: 288b [ b - p + 12 ]

Right side: 169 (12 + b + c )² 

So, equation is:

288b (b - p + 12 ) = 169 (12 + b + c )² 

This still seems complex. Perhaps there's another approach.

Alternatively, since we know that GD is perpendicular to AC, and since D is the touch point on AC. The coordinates of D can be determined as follows. The touch point on AC divides AC into segments of length AF' = AE' = s - BC, where s is semiperimeter. Wait, earlier mentioned that the touch point on AC is CD' = s - AB. Wait, let me recall:

Touch point on BC is D', BD' = s - AC, CD' = s - AB.

Touch point on AC is E', AE' = s - BC, CE' = s - AB.

Touch point on AB is F', AF' = s - BC, BF' = s - AC.

Wait, so if D is the touch point on AC, then AD = s - BC. Wait, let me verify.

Yes, for example, the length from A to touch point on BC is s - AC. Wait, no:

Let me recall the formula: the length from vertex A to the touch point on BC is s - AC. Wait, no, the touch point on BC is D', then BD' = s - AC, CD' = s - AB. Similarly, the touch point on AC is E', then AE' = s - BC, and EC' = s - AB. 

Therefore, if D is the touch point on AC, then AD = AE' = s - BC. 

Similarly, since D lies on AC, its coordinates can be determined once we know A and C.

But how does this help us? Well, since GD is perpendicular to AC, and D is the touch point on AC. Also, since G is the incenter, GD is the inradius r, and the direction of GD is perpendicular to AC. Therefore, the vector from G to D is perpendicular to AC.

Alternatively, since we know coordinates of D, and coordinates of G, we could write equations for that. But without knowing A's coordinates, this might be difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that CG = 13. Given that C is at (12, 0), and G is the incenter. Also, inradius r = G_y = 12q / (12 + b + c ). Also, the distance from C to G is 13. Let me think if there's a relationship between CG and other elements.

Another idea: In a triangle, the distance from a vertex to the incenter can be expressed in terms of the angles and the inradius. For example, the distance from C to G can be calculated using the formula:

CG² = R² + r² - 2Rr cos C, where R is the circumradius. Wait, but I don't know if that helps here. Alternatively, using the formula for the distance from vertex to incenter.

Alternatively, using coordinates. Let me think. We have:

Coordinates of G are ( [12p + 12c ] / (12 + b + c ), 12q / (12 + b + c ) )

Coordinates of C are (12, 0). So, vector from C to G is (G_x - 12, G_y - 0) = ( [12p + 12c - 12*(12 + b + c ) ] / (12 + b + c ), 12q / (12 + b + c ) )

As previously derived, the x-component was [12(p - b - 12 )]/(12 + b + c )

So, CG² = [12(p - b - 12 )]^2 / (12 + b + c )² + [12q]^2 / (12 + b + c )² = [ 144 (p - b - 12 )² + 144 q² ] / (12 + b + c )² = 169.

Which simplifies to:

[ 144 { (p - b - 12 )² + q² } ] / (12 + b + c )² = 169.

As before.

But (p - b - 12 )² + q² = ?

Earlier, we had expanded this as 2b(b - p + 12 ) ?

Wait, earlier steps led us to:

(p - b - 12 )² + q² = 2b [ b - p + 12 ]

Wait, no, earlier substitution showed that (p - b - 12 )² + q² equals 2b [ b - p + 12 ] ?

Wait, let me redo that calculation.

We had:

(p - b - 12 )² + q² = ?

Expanding (p - b - 12 )² = (p - 12 - b )² = (p - 12)^2 - 2b(p - 12) + b²

Add q²: (p - 12)^2 - 2b(p - 12) + b² + q².

But since b² = (p - 12)^2 + q², we can replace (p - 12)^2 + q² with b².

So:

= [ (p - 12)^2 + q² ] - 2b(p - 12 ) + b² - (p - 12)^2 - q² + (p - 12)^2 + q² ? Wait, no, let me re-express:

Wait, original expression after expansion is:

(p - 12)^2 - 2b(p - 12 ) + b² + q² 

But since b² = (p - 12)^2 + q², then replacing:

= [(p - 12)^2 + q² ] - 2b(p - 12 ) + b² - (p - 12)^2 - q² + (p - 12)^2 + q² ?

No, let me substitute b² = (p - 12)^2 + q² into the expression:

So, replace (p - 12)^2 + q² with b². So:

= [ (p - 12)^2 + q² ] - 2b(p - 12 ) + b² 

Wait, no. Original expression is:

(p - 12)^2 - 2b(p - 12 ) + b² + q² 

Wait, no, the term is:

After expanding (p - b - 12 )² + q² = (p - 12)^2 - 2b(p - 12 ) + b² + q² 

Now, since b² = (p - 12)^2 + q², then substitute:

= [(p - 12)^2 + q² ] - 2b(p - 12 ) + b² 

Wait, no, the expression is:

(p - 12)^2 - 2b(p - 12 ) + b² + q² 

Wait, no, the original expression after expansion is:

(p - 12)^2 - 2b(p - 12 ) + b² + q² 

Wait, no, the expansion was:

(p - 12)^2 - 2b(p - 12 ) + b² + q² ?

Wait, no, the original expression was:

(p - b - 12 )² + q² = (p - 12)^2 - 2b(p - 12 ) + b² + q² ?

No, the expansion of (p - b - 12 )² is (p - 12 - b )² = (p - 12)^2 - 2b(p - 12 ) + b², and then adding q² gives:

(p - 12)^2 - 2b(p - 12 ) + b² + q² 

Now, since b² = (p - 12)^2 + q², substitute:

= [(p - 12)^2 + q² ] - 2b(p - 12 ) + b² - (p - 12)^2 - q² + (p - 12)^2 + q² ? This seems messy. Let me instead replace (p - 12)^2 + q² with b²:

= [ (p - 12)^2 + q² ] - 2b(p - 12 ) + b² - (p - 12)^2 - q² + (p - 12)^2 + q² ? No, that's not helpful. Let me think differently.

Let me take the expression:

(p - 12)^2 - 2b(p - 12 ) + b² + q² 

= [ (p - 12)^2 + q² ] + b² - 2b(p - 12 )

But (p - 12)^2 + q² = b², so:

= b² + b² - 2b(p - 12 ) 

= 2b² - 2b(p - 12 )

= 2b [ b - (p - 12 ) ]

= 2b [ b - p + 12 ]

Ah, there we go. So, (p - b - 12 )² + q² = 2b(b - p + 12 )

Thus, returning to our main equation:

[ 144 * 2b(b - p + 12 ) ] / (12 + b + c )² = 169 

=> 288b(b - p + 12 ) = 169 (12 + b + c )² 

Now, let's try to find expressions for b and c in terms of p and q. Recall that:

b = |AC| = sqrt( (p - 12)^2 + q² )

c = |AB| = sqrt( p² + q² )

Also, note that (b - p + 12 ) = sqrt( (p - 12)^2 + q² ) - p + 12.

This seems complicated. Perhaps we need another relation. Let's think about the semiperimeter and area.

We know that area is 6q, and semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = (12 + b + c)/2.

Also, r = area/s = 6q / [(12 + b + c)/2] = 12q / (12 + b + c ), which is G_y.

But we also have that inradius r = GD = GF = GE. Also, since GF is the distance from G to BC, which is G_y = r, and GF = r. Also, CG = 13.

Is there a way to relate CG with other elements? Let me recall that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be calculated using formula:

For example, the distance from C to G is given by:

CG² = R² + r² - 2Rr cos C, where R is the circumradius. But unless we know R or angle C, this may not help directly.

Alternatively, using coordinates, we can write CG² = (G_x - 12)^2 + G_y^2 = 169.

But we already did that and arrived at the equation involving b, c, p, q.

Perhaps we need to find relationships between p and q. Let's try to find another equation.

We know that the touch point D on AC has coordinates determined by AD = s - BC. Let me calculate AD.

AD = s - BC, where s = (a + b + c)/2 = (12 + b + c)/2. BC = a = 12.

So AD = [ (12 + b + c)/2 ] - 12 = (12 + b + c - 24)/2 = (b + c - 12)/2.

Since AC has length b, then AD = (b + c - 12)/2, so DC = AC - AD = b - (b + c - 12)/2 = (2b - b - c + 12)/2 = (b - c + 12)/2.

But also, since D lies on AC, we can parameterize its coordinates. Let me parametrize AC.

Coordinates of A: (p, q), coordinates of C: (12, 0). So, vector from A to C is (12 - p, -q). Parameter t ∈ [0, 1], D = A + t*(vector AC).

So, coordinates of D are (p + t*(12 - p), q + t*(-q)) = (p + t(12 - p), q(1 - t)).

The length AD is t * |AC| = tb. Since AD = (b + c - 12)/2, then t = [ (b + c - 12)/2 ] / b = (b + c - 12)/(2b).

Thus, coordinates of D:

x_D = p + [ (b + c - 12)/(2b) ] * (12 - p )

y_D = q(1 - t ) = q[ 1 - (b + c - 12)/(2b) ] = q[ (2b - b - c + 12 ) / (2b ) ] = q[ (b - c + 12 ) / (2b ) ]

Now, since GD is perpendicular to AC. The slope of AC is (0 - q)/(12 - p ) = -q/(12 - p). Therefore, the slope of GD, being perpendicular, is (12 - p)/q.

The slope of GD is (y_D - G_y ) / (x_D - G_x ) = [ y_D - G_y ] / (x_D - G_x ) = (12 - p)/q.

Let me write this equation:

(y_D - G_y ) = [ (12 - p)/q ] (x_D - G_x )

This provides another equation relating p, q, b, c.

But this seems very complex. Perhaps there's a smarter approach.

Let me think about special triangles. Given that CG = 13 and BC = 12. Maybe triangle ABC is a right triangle? Or some other type?

Alternatively, since CG = 13, and BC = 12, maybe triangle CGC? Wait, not sure. Let me think of possible triangles where the inradius and distances from vertices to incenter are known.

Alternatively, perhaps assuming specific values for the triangle.

Let me assume that triangle ABC is a right triangle. Let me suppose that angle at B is right. Let's say B is at (0,0), C at (12,0), A at (0, k), making ABC a right triangle at B. Then, AB = k, BC = 12, AC = sqrt(k² + 144). 

In this case, the inradius r = (AB + BC - AC)/2 = (k + 12 - sqrt(k² + 144))/2. Wait, no, the formula for inradius in a right triangle is r = (AB + BC - AC)/2. Yes, because for a right triangle, r = (a + b - c)/2, where c is hypotenuse.

So, in this case, r = (AB + BC - AC)/2 = (k + 12 - sqrt(k² + 144))/2.

Also, coordinates of incenter G in a right triangle at B would be at (r, r). Because in a right triangle, the inradius is r, and the incenter is located at (r, r) if the legs are along axes. 

Wait, in this case, if B is at (0,0), C at (12,0), and A at (0,k), then the incenter is at (r, r). So, coordinates of G are (r, r). Then, the distance from C to G is sqrt( (12 - r)^2 + (0 - r)^2 ) = sqrt( (12 - r)^2 + r² ) = 13.

So, solving:

(12 - r)^2 + r² = 169

Expand:

144 - 24r + r² + r² = 169

2r² -24r + 144 - 169 = 0

2r² -24r -25 = 0

Divide by 2:

r² -12r -12.5 = 0

Solutions:

r = [12 ± sqrt(144 + 50)] / 2 = [12 ± sqrt(194)] / 2 ≈ [12 ± 13.928]/2

Positive solution: (12 + 13.928)/2 ≈ 25.928/2 ≈ 12.964, which would make sense since in a right triangle, r is positive and smaller than the legs. But this seems large. For example, if r ≈ 13, but BC is 12. But in this scenario, the inradius can't be larger than the legs. So, this suggests contradiction. Hence, our assumption that ABC is a right triangle at B might be wrong.

Alternatively, maybe ABC is not a right triangle. Let me try another approach.

Since we know CG = 13 and BC = 12. Let me think about using the formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex. 

There is a formula for the distance from a vertex to the incenter. For example, in triangle ABC, the distance from C to the incenter G is given by:

CG = √[r² + (s - c)^2]

Where r is the inradius, and s is the semiperimeter, and c is the side opposite to C. Wait, let me verify this formula.

Yes, in general, the distance from vertex C to the incenter can be derived using the formula:

CG² = r² + (s - c)^2

Where s is the semiperimeter, and c is the length of side AB (since in standard notation, a = BC, b = AC, c = AB).

Let me confirm this formula. Let's derive it.

Consider the incenter G. The distance from G to vertex C can be found by considering the coordinates or using trigonometry. Let me think of it in terms of vectors or coordinates.

Alternatively, using the formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex. In triangle ABC, the distance from C to G is:

CG = √[r² + (s - c)^2]

Yes, this formula is known. Let me check with an example: in an equilateral triangle with side length a, the inradius r = (a√3)/6. Semiperimeter s = 3a/2. s - c = 3a/2 - a = a/2. Then CG would be √[r² + (s - c)^2] = √[ (a²/12) + (a²/4) ] = √[ (a²/12 + 3a²/12 ) ] = √[4a²/12] = √[a²/3] = a/√3. Which is correct, since in an equilateral triangle, the distance from a vertex to the incenter is 2/3 of the height. Height h = (√3/2)a, so 2/3*h = (√3/3)a = a/√3. Correct. So the formula holds.

Therefore, applying this formula to our problem: CG = √[r² + (s - c)^2] = 13.

Given that, let's write:

CG² = r² + (s - c)^2 = 169.

We also know that r = area / s, and s = (a + b + c)/2.

Given that a = BC = 12, b = AC, c = AB.

Let me denote:

Let me recall that in this formula, c is the side opposite to C, which is AB. So, in standard notation, a = BC, b = AC, c = AB. So, s - c = (a + b + c)/2 - c = (a + b - c)/2.

So, CG² = r² + [(a + b - c)/2]^2 = 169.

Also, r = area / s.

So, let's write:

Let me denote:

Let me call s = (a + b + c)/2 = (12 + b + c)/2.

So, CG² = (area/s)^2 + [(a + b - c)/2]^2 = 169.

But also, area can be expressed via Heron's formula: area = √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)].

But this might get complex. Let me see if I can find another relation.

Alternatively, since we know that in our case, a = 12, and we need to relate other variables.

Let me try to combine the two equations.

First, CG² = r² + [(a + b - c)/2]^2 = 169.

But r = area / s, and area = √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)].

This seems too abstract. Let me try plugging in a = 12.

Let me denote:

Let me let x = b = AC, y = c = AB.

Then, s = (12 + x + y)/2.

Area = √[s(s - 12)(s - x)(s - y)]

Also, r = area / s.

So, CG² = (area/s)^2 + [(12 + x - y)/2]^2 = 169.

But this still leaves too many variables. However, perhaps we can use the fact that the touch point D on AC has AD = s - BC = s - 12. As earlier, AD = (12 + x + y)/2 - 12 = (x + y - 12)/2.

But also, in the earlier coordinate system, AD = (b + c - 12)/2, which is consistent.

But how does this help us? Maybe not directly.

Wait, but we also know that GD is the inradius r, and GD is perpendicular to AC. So, in the coordinate system, GD is the vertical distance from G to AC, which is r. But also, in this case, since we've assumed a general triangle, perhaps there's a way to link the variables.

Alternatively, let's try to assume specific values. For instance, if we assume that the triangle is such that CG = 13, and BC = 12, and try to find possible values for the inradius and other parameters.

Let me recall that CG² = r² + (s - c)^2 = 169.

Also, r = area / s.

But also, area can be expressed as r*s.

Wait, area = r*s. So, substituting into CG²:

CG² = (area/s)^2 + [(s - c)^2] = ( (r*s)/s )^2 + (s - c)^2 = r² + (s - c)^2 = 169.

Which confirms the formula.

But we need to find r and s - c.

But we need more relations. Let me think about the fact that in the problem, we are to find EG. What is EG? Since E is the touch point on AB, and G is the incenter. So, the distance from G to E is the inradius r, because GE is perpendicular to AB and E is the touch point. Wait, no! Wait, GE is perpendicular to AB, and E is the touch point on AB. So, GE is the inradius r, because it's the distance from G to AB. So, EG = r.

Wait, if that's true, then the question asks for EG, which is r. So, the answer is r. So, if we can find r, then EG = r.

But then, the problem reduces to finding r, given that CG = 13 and BC = 12.

So, let me focus on finding r.

We have CG² = r² + (s - c)^2 = 169.

But we need to find r. To do this, we need to find s - c.

What is s - c? s = (a + b + c)/2, so s - c = (a + b + c)/2 - c = (a + b - c)/2.

But a = 12, so s - c = (12 + b - c)/2.

But b = AC, c = AB. How to relate b and c?

We need another relation. Let me recall that in any triangle, the sum of squares of sides relates to other quantities, but I don't see immediately.

Wait, but we also know that the distance from G to C is 13, and we have CG² = r² + (s - c)^2 = 169.

But we need another equation relating r and s - c. Let me think.

We also know that in a triangle, the inradius r = (area)/s.

But area can also be expressed using Heron's formula: area = √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)]. 

So, r = √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] / s = √[(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)/s].

But this might not help directly.

Alternatively, let me consider using the Law of Cosines. But without knowing angles or other sides, it's hard.

Wait, but perhaps there's a relation between s - c and other terms. Let me think.

Let me denote d = s - c = (12 + b - c)/2.

Then, CG² = r² + d² = 169.

Also, we know that in a triangle, the product (s - a)(s - b)(s - c) = r^2 s.

Wait, no, the formula is area = r*s, and area = √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], so:

r*s = √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] 

Squaring both sides: r² s² = s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)

Cancel s: r² s = (s - a)(s - b)(s - c)

So, r² = [(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] / s

But this might not help directly.

Alternatively, since we have d = s - c = (12 + b - c)/2, and we also have s - a = (12 + b + c)/2 - 12 = (b + c - 12)/2 = (b + c - a)/2.

Similarly, s - b = (a + c - b)/2.

So, let me write:

Let me denote:

d = (a + b - c)/2 = (12 + b - c)/2

e = (a + c - b)/2 = (12 + c - b)/2

f = (b + c - a)/2 = (b + c - 12)/2

Note that these are the lengths of the tangents from the vertices to the incircle. So, f = AD = (b + c - a)/2 = (b + c - 12)/2, as before.

Now, the product (s - a)(s - b)(s - c) = f * e * d.

But from earlier, r² s = f * e * d.

But also, CG² = r² + d² = 169.

So, we have two equations:

1. r² s = f e d

2. r² + d² = 169

But we need more relations. Let me think about expressing f, e, d in terms of a, b, c.

But this seems too vague. Let me try to assume some value for d, and see if it leads to consistency.

Let me assume that d is some value, say, let's suppose that d = 5. Then, r² + 25 = 169 => r² = 144 => r = 12. Is this possible? Let's see.

If r = 12, then from equation 1: r² s = f e d => 144 s = f e d.

But what is s? s = (a + b + c)/2 = (12 + b + c)/2.

Also, d = (12 + b - c)/2.

But without knowing b and c, it's hard to proceed. Let me try to think of a triangle where r = 12 and CG = 13.

But if r = 12, then the inradius is 12, and CG = 13. Let me imagine a triangle where the inradius is 12 and the distance from C to the incenter is 13. Possible?

Yes, for example, if the triangle is very tall. Let me think of a degenerate case, but likely not. However, without more info, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, let's try to find d and r such that r² + d² = 169. Possible integer solutions: like r=5, d=12; r=12, d=5; r=13, d=0 (but d cannot be zero); r=0, d=13 (invalid). So possible pairs are (5,12), (12,5).

Assume that r = 5, d = 12. Then, r = 5, d = 12.

Then, from equation 1: r² s = f e d => 25 s = f e * 12.

But what is f e d? Let me recall that f = (b + c - 12)/2, e = (12 + c - b)/2, d = (12 + b - c)/2.

So, f = (b + c - 12)/2, e = (12 + c - b)/2, d = (12 + b - c)/2.

Notice that e = (12 + c - b)/2 = (12 - (b - c))/2, and d = (12 + b - c)/2.

So, e = (12 - (b - c))/2, d = (12 + (b - c))/2. Let me set k = b - c. Then, d = (12 + k)/2, e = (12 - k)/2.

Then, f = (b + c - 12)/2. Note that b + c = (b - c) + 2c = k + 2c, but not sure. Alternatively, since b + c = (b - c) + 2c = k + 2c, but not helpful.

Alternatively, since f = (b + c - 12)/2, and from the definitions, we have:

Also, note that in a triangle, b + c > a = 12, so f > 0.

But how to relate f, e, d?

We have f * e * d = [(b + c - 12)/2] * [(12 + c - b)/2] * [(12 + b - c)/2] = [(b + c - 12)/2] * [ (12 + c - b)(12 + b - c)/4 ].

Let me compute (12 + c - b)(12 + b - c) = [12 + (c - b)][12 - (c - b)] = 12² - (c - b)^2 = 144 - (c - b)^2.

So, f * e * d = [(b + c - 12)/2] * [144 - (c - b)^2 ] / 4 = [(b + c - 12)/2] * [144 - (c - b)^2 ] / 4.

But this seems complex. Let me assume that k = b - c, so that c = b - k. Then, b + c = b + (b - k) = 2b - k. So, b + c - 12 = 2b - k - 12. Also, c - b = -k, so (c - b)^2 = k².

Then, f * e * d = [(2b - k - 12)/2] * [144 - k²]/4.

But this introduces new variables, b and k. Not helpful.

Alternatively, let me try to assume that d = 12, r = 5. Then, from equation 1: 25s = f * e * 12.

But what is s? s = (12 + b + c)/2.

But without knowing b and c, it's difficult. However, let me recall that in this scenario, d = (12 + b - c)/2 = 12 => 12 + b - c = 24 => b - c = 12. So, b = c + 12.

Let me substitute b = c + 12 into the equation.

Then, s = (12 + b + c)/2 = (12 + c + 12 + c)/2 = (24 + 2c)/2 = 12 + c.

Also, f = (b + c - 12)/2 = (c + 12 + c - 12)/2 = (2c)/2 = c.

e = (12 + c - b)/2 = (12 + c - (c + 12))/2 = (12 + c - c - 12)/2 = 0/2 = 0. Wait, e = 0? That would imply that (s - b) = 0, meaning s = b. But s = 12 + c, and b = c + 12. So, s = b. Hence, s = b. Which implies that 12 + c = b = c + 12. Which is true. So, e = 0. Hence, f * e * d = c * 0 * 12 = 0. So, equation 1: 25s = 0 => 25(12 + c) = 0 => c = -12, which is impossible since lengths are positive. Contradiction. So, this assumption is invalid.

So, assuming d = 12 and r = 5 leads to contradiction. Let me try the other possibility: r = 12, d = 5.

So, r = 12, d = 5.

Then, from equation 1: r² s = f e d => 144s = f e * 5.

Also, d = (12 + b - c)/2 = 5 => 12 + b - c = 10 => b - c = -2 => c = b + 2.

Now, let's compute f and e.

f = (b + c - 12)/2. Since c = b + 2, this becomes (b + b + 2 - 12)/2 = (2b - 10)/2 = b - 5.

e = (12 + c - b)/2 = (12 + (b + 2) - b)/2 = (14)/2 = 7.

So, f = b - 5, e = 7, d = 5.

Thus, f * e * d = (b - 5)*7*5 = 35(b - 5).

Equation 1: 144s = 35(b - 5).

But s = (12 + b + c)/2 = (12 + b + b + 2)/2 = (2b + 14)/2 = b + 7.

Thus, 144(b + 7) = 35(b - 5).

Expand:

144b + 1008 = 35b - 175

144b - 35b = -175 - 1008

109b = -1183

b = -1183 / 109 ≈ -10.853. Negative length, which is impossible. Contradiction again.

Hmm, so assuming r = 12, d = 5 also leads to contradiction. Maybe our initial assumption that CG² = r² + (s - c)^2 is incorrect?

Wait, let me double-check the formula for CG. Earlier, I recalled the formula CG² = r² + (s - c)^2, but maybe it's CG² = r² + (s - a)^2? Or another combination?

Wait, let me derive it properly. Let me consider the distance from C to G.

In a triangle, the incenter G has coordinates (using barycentric coordinates) proportional to a, b, c. But let me use vector approach.

Alternatively, consider the formula for the distance from a vertex to the incenter. Let me recall that in any triangle, the distance from vertex A to the incenter is √[r² + (s - a)^2]. Similarly for other vertices.

Yes, this is a known formula. So, CG² = r² + (s - c)^2, where s is the semiperimeter, and c is the side opposite to C, which is AB.

So, the formula is correct. Hence, our previous assumptions leading to contradictions suggest that either our approach is missing something, or the triangle has non-standard properties.

Alternatively, perhaps the triangle is such that s - c is a fraction, and r is a fraction, leading to CG = 13.

Let me try to set up the equation with variables.

Let me let s - c = x. Then, CG² = r² + x² = 169.

Also, from the formula r = (area)/s.

But area = r*s.

Also, from Heron's formula, area = √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = √[s(s - a)(s - b)x].

But also, area = r*s.

So, r*s = √[s(s - a)(s - b)x] => square both sides:

r² s² = s(s - a)(s - b)x => r² s = (s - a)(s - b)x.

But we also have x = s - c = (a + b + c)/2 - c = (a + b - c)/2.

Let me denote:

Let me set a = 12, as given.

Let me denote b = AC, c = AB.

Then, x = (12 + b - c)/2.

Also, s = (12 + b + c)/2.

So, (s - a) = (12 + b + c)/2 - 12 = (b + c - 12)/2 = (b + c - a)/2.

Similarly, (s - b) = (12 + b + c)/2 - b = (12 - b + c)/2 = (12 + c - b)/2.

So, the equation r² s = (s - a)(s - b)x becomes:

r² s = [(b + c - 12)/2] * [(12 + c - b)/2] * x.

But x = (12 + b - c)/2.

So, substituting x:

r² s = [(b + c - 12)/2] * [(12 + c - b)/2] * [(12 + b - c)/2] = [(b + c - 12)/2] * [(12 + c - b)(12 + b - c)/4].

Note that (12 + c - b)(12 + b - c) = 12² - (b - c)^2 = 144 - (b - c)^2.

So, r² s = [(b + c - 12)/2] * [144 - (b - c)^2]/4 = [(b + c - 12)(144 - (b - c)^2)] / 8.

This is getting too complex. Let me try to introduce variables for simplicity.

Let me let u = b + c, v = b - c.

Then, b + c = u, b - c = v.

So, b = (u + v)/2, c = (u - v)/2.

Also, b + c - 12 = u - 12.

Also, (b - c)^2 = v².

So, the expression becomes:

r² s = [(u - 12) * (144 - v²)] / 8.

Also, s = (12 + u)/2.

So, r² * (12 + u)/2 = [(u - 12)(144 - v²)] / 8.

Multiply both sides by 8:

4r²(12 + u) = (u - 12)(144 - v²).

But this still involves u and v, and we need more relations. Let me recall that in a triangle, the sides must satisfy triangle inequalities. Also, we have u = b + c > a = 12, so u > 12.

But without additional information, it's challenging to proceed.

Maybe I need to consider that EG = r, and the answer choices include 5, 12, etc. Given that, and the earlier attempts to assume r = 5 or 12 led to contradictions, perhaps there's a different approach.

Wait, going back to the beginning, the problem states that G is the incenter, and we are to find EG. But earlier, I thought that EG is the inradius r, because GE is perpendicular to AB and E is the touch point. Is that correct?

Yes, because the incenter is at distance r from each side, and E is the touch point on AB, so GE is the perpendicular from G to AB, hence its length is r. So, EG = r.

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding r, given that CG = 13 and BC = 12.

So, if I can find r, then EG = r, and select the answer from the choices.

Let me try to use the formula CG² = r² + (s - c)^2 = 169.

Let me denote s - c = x.
