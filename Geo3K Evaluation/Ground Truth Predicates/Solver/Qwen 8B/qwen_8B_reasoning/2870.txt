====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out how to find the measure of angle 2 here. So first, I need to visualize the diagram based on the given constraints. Let me jot down all the information provided:

We have points A, B, C, D, E. The angles mentioned are:

- Angle at B, between C and E (Angle(B, C, E)) is 109 degrees.
- Angle at D, between A and C (Angle(D, A, C)) equals angle 2.
- Angle at E, between D and A (Angle(E, D, A)) is 95 degrees.
- Angle at D, between B and C (Angle(D, B, C)) equals angle 3.
- Angle at E, between A and B (Angle(E, A, B)) is 33 degrees.
- Angle at A, between B and E (Angle(A, B, E)) is 24 degrees.
- Angle at B, between E and A (Angle(B, E, A)) equals angle 1.

Also, point E lies on line AC and line BD. So E is the intersection point of lines AC and BD.

Hmm, since E is on both AC and BD, that means lines AC and BD intersect at E. So maybe we can consider triangles involving these points?

Let me try to sketch mentally. Points A, B, C connected via some lines. Point D somewhere such that BD passes through E. And E is also on AC. So E is the intersection of diagonals AC and BD.

So perhaps there's a quadrilateral ABCD? Or maybe triangle ABC with BD as a cevian? Not sure yet. Let me think about the angles.

First, looking at angle at E between D and A (Angle(E, D, A) = 95°). That would be ∠DEA = 95°, right? Since it's the angle at E between D and A. Similarly, angle at E between A and B (∠EAB?) Wait, no. Wait, Angle(E, A, B) is 33°, which is ∠AEB? Because the middle letter is the vertex. So ∠AEB is 33°, and ∠BEA is same thing. Also, ∠(B,E,A) is angle at E between B and A, so that's same as ∠AEB, which is 33°. But then there's another angle at B, ∠(B,C,E) is 109°, which is ∠BEC. Wait, because the angle is at B, between C and E. So that would be ∠CBE? Wait, no. If the angle is at B, between C and E, then it's ∠CBE. Wait, but the notation might be different. Let me clarify.

In standard notation, Angle(X,Y,Z) refers to the angle at Y, between X and Z. So for example, Angle(B,C,E) is the angle at point C between points B and E. Wait, wait! Wait, no. Wait, the angle is formed by three points: the middle point is the vertex. So Angle(B, C, E) is the angle at point C between points B and E. So that would be ∠BCE. Similarly, Angle(D, A, C) is the angle at point A between points D and C, so ∠DAC. Okay, got it.

Similarly, Angle(E, D, A) is the angle at D between E and A, so ∠EDA. Angle(E, A, B) is angle at A between E and B, so ∠EAB. Angle(A,B,E) is angle at B between A and E, so ∠ABE. And Angle(B,E,A) is angle at E between B and A, so ∠BEA.

Wait, but some of these angles may form parts of triangles. Let me try to see.

Since E is on AC and BD, so lines AC and BD intersect at E. Therefore, considering triangles involving E.

For instance, triangle ABD has point E on BD, and triangle BEC, etc.

But maybe focusing on triangle ABE first. Given that ∠AEB is 33°, and ∠ABE is 24°, as per Angle(A,B,E)=24°. Wait, Angle(A,B,E) is the angle at B between A and E, so ∠ABE=24°, and ∠AEB=33°. Then in triangle ABE, we can compute the third angle at A.

Wait, triangle ABE: sum of angles is 180°. So ∠ABE + ∠BAE + ∠AEB = 180°. We know ∠ABE is 24°, ∠AEB is 33°, so ∠BAE = 180 - 24 - 33 = 123°. Therefore, ∠BAE = 123°. 

Now, ∠BAE is part of angle at A. Let me check if there are more angles at point A. For example, Angle(D, A, C) is ∠DAC, which is angle at A between D and C. So if we consider line AC, which passes through E, then ∠BAE and ∠DAC could be adjacent angles forming something else? Wait, if E is on AC, then from point A, the line AE is part of AC. So if there's a line AD making an angle with AC at point A, then ∠DAC is part of that. Wait, maybe I need to consider triangle ADC or something else.

Alternatively, since E is on AC, then AE is a segment from A to E on AC. So if we look at point D, which is connected to B and E (since E lies on BD), then BD connects B to D passing through E.

So maybe considering triangle BDE or something else. Alternatively, looking at triangle BCD? Hmm.

Wait, let me note down all known angles:

From triangle ABE:

∠ABE = 24°, ∠AEB = 33°, so ∠BAE = 123°, as above.

Then, ∠BAE is the angle at A between B and E. Now, since E is on AC, then AE is along AC. Therefore, ∠BAE is the angle between AB and AE (which is part of AC). So, if we consider line AC, then from point A, going towards C, and AB forms an angle of 123° with that direction.

Now, looking at angle ∠DAC, which is equal to angle 2. So ∠DAC is the angle at A between D and C. Since E is on AC, then line AE is part of AC, so ∠DAC is the angle between DA and AC. Therefore, if we can find ∠DAC, that's angle 2.

To find ∠DAC, perhaps we can consider triangle DAC. But to do that, we need more information. Maybe looking at other angles around point A or using other triangles.

Alternatively, since E is on AC, maybe we can use vertical angles or other relationships.

Looking at point E, which is on BD and AC. So lines BD and AC intersect at E. Therefore, we can consider vertical angles formed at E. For example, ∠AED and ∠BEC are vertical angles? Wait, no. When two lines cross, vertical angles are opposite each other. So, if BD crosses AC at E, then the angles around E would include:

At point E, angles:

- Between A and B: ∠AEB = 33°, given.

- Between B and C: ?

Wait, maybe I should label all angles around E.

At point E, there are four angles formed by lines AC and BD. Let me denote them:

- ∠AEB = 33° (given)

- ∠CED = ? (since E is on AC and BD, so line BD splits into EB and ED.)

Wait, since E is on BD, then from point E, BD goes to B and D. So the lines EA (part of AC) and ED (part of BD) meet at E. So the angles around E would involve:

Between EA and ED: which would be ∠AED.

Between ED and EB: which would be ∠DEB.

Between EB and EC: ?

Wait, maybe I need to think again. Since E is on AC, then from E, line AC continues to C. So from E, the line EC is extending from E to C. So, at point E, lines BD and AC intersect. Thus, the angles at E are:

- Between BA and ED: ?

Wait, perhaps better to list all angles at E:

The lines BD and AC intersect at E. Therefore, they form two pairs of vertical angles.

One pair is ∠AEB and ∠CED (opposite angles).

Another pair is ∠AED and ∠BEC (the other pair).

Given that ∠AEB is 33°, then its vertical angle ∠CED is also 33°.

Additionally, we have ∠(E,D,A) = 95°, which is ∠EDA. Wait, ∠EDA is the angle at D between E and A. So that's part of triangle DEA. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe focusing on triangle DEA. In triangle DEA, we know ∠EDA = 95°, and if we can find other angles, maybe we can relate them.

But let me see. From earlier, we had ∠AED. Wait, ∠AED is part of triangle DEA. Also, ∠AED is supplementary to ∠AEB if they are linear pair? No, unless points B and C are aligned in a certain way.

Wait, let me think again. At point E, lines BD and AC cross. So the angles around E sum up to 360°. We already have ∠AEB = 33°, and its vertical angle ∠CED = 33°. What about the other two angles, ∠AED and ∠BEC?

If we can find those, we can get more info.

Let me consider that ∠AED is adjacent to ∠AEB. Are they supplementary? Well, if you imagine line AC passing through E, then ∠AEB is between BE and AE, while ∠AED is between AE and DE. So, if BD passes through E, then the angles on one side of AC would add up to 180°? Wait, no. Because BD is crossing AC at E, so depending on the orientation, but generally, the sum of angles around point E is 360°.

So, total angles around E: ∠AEB + ∠BED + ∠CED + ∠AED = 360°. But since ∠AEB and ∠CED are vertical angles, they are equal. Let me denote:

Let’s call ∠AEB = x = 33°, so ∠CED = x = 33°. Then, the remaining two angles are ∠BED and ∠AED. However, ∠BED and ∠AED are also vertical angles? Wait, no. If lines BD and AC cross at E, then ∠AEB and ∠CED are vertical angles. The other pair is ∠AED and ∠BEC. Wait, yes. So ∠AED and ∠BEC are vertical angles, so they are equal. Let me denote ∠AED = y, so ∠BEC = y.

Therefore, total angles around E:

x + x + y + y = 2x + 2y = 360° => x + y = 180°. Since x is 33°, then y = 180° - 33° = 147°. Therefore, ∠AED = 147°, and ∠BEC = 147°.

Now, knowing that ∠AED = 147°, which is part of triangle AED. In triangle AED, we know ∠EDA = 95°, and ∠AED = 147°, so we can find ∠DAE (which is ∠DAE, the angle at A between D and E). Wait, ∠DAE is the angle at A between D and E. Which is the same as ∠DAE, which is part of ∠DAC, since E is on AC. So ∠DAC is ∠DAE plus ∠EAC? Wait, no. Since E is on AC, then from point A, moving along AC, the line AE is just a segment of AC. Therefore, ∠DAE is the angle between DA and AE (which is part of AC). Therefore, ∠DAE is the same as ∠DAC, which is angle 2. Wait, no. Wait, ∠DAC is the angle at A between D and C. Since E is on AC, then ∠DAC is the angle between DA and AC. But since AE is part of AC, then ∠DAC is equal to ∠DAE. Because from point A, DA makes an angle with AC (which is AE extended to C). So yes, ∠DAC = ∠DAE.

Thus, in triangle AED, we have:

∠EDA = 95°, ∠AED = 147°, so the third angle ∠DAE = 180° - 95° - 147° = 180 - 242 = -62°? Wait, that can’t be possible. Negative angle? That suggests a mistake in my reasoning.

Oh no, that can't be right. There must be an error here. Let me re-examine.

Earlier, I said that the sum of angles around point E is 360°, with ∠AEB = 33°, and ∠CED = 33°, so the remaining two angles ∠AED and ∠BEC sum to 360 - 2*33 = 360 - 66 = 294°, so each of ∠AED and ∠BEC would be half of that? Wait, no, only if they are equal. But why would they be equal?

Wait, earlier assumption was that ∠AED and ∠BEC are vertical angles. Is that true?

When two lines intersect, vertical angles are across from each other. So if lines BD and AC intersect at E, then vertical angles are:

- ∠AEB and ∠CED (as before)

- ∠AED and ∠BEC (yes). So they are vertical angles, hence equal. So their measures are equal. So ∠AED = ∠BEC. So total angles around E:

∠AEB + ∠CED + ∠AED + ∠BEC = 33 + 33 + y + y = 66 + 2y = 360 → 2y = 294 → y = 147°, so ∠AED = ∠BEC = 147°, which is what I had before.

But then in triangle AED, angles are:

∠EDA = 95°, ∠AED = 147°, and ∠DAE = ?. Summing to 180°, so ∠DAE = 180 - 95 - 147 = negative number. That can't be. So there's a contradiction here. Which means my previous assumption is wrong.

Where did I go wrong?

Possibly in assuming that ∠AED is 147°. Wait, but if ∠AED is part of triangle AED, and if that gives a negative angle, then there's a mistake in the logic. Let me check again.

Perhaps the mistake is in identifying which angles are vertical. Let me think again about the angles around point E.

Lines BD and AC intersect at E. So the four angles formed are:

1. Between BA and ED: This would be ∠AEB = 33°, given.

Wait, no. Let me think carefully. Imagine point E where BD and AC cross. So starting from point E, going clockwise:

- First angle is between EB and ED: this would be ∠BED.

- Next angle is between ED and EC: ∠DEC.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the labels. Let me consider the directions.

Assume line AC horizontal, with E somewhere on it. Line BD crosses AC at E. So from point E, line BD extends to B and D.

So, from point E, the directions are:

- One direction towards B (along BD), and the other towards D (along BD).

- Along AC, from E, towards A and towards C.

So the angles at E are:

- Between EB and EA: ∠AEB = 33°, given.

- Between EA and ED: ∠AED.

- Between ED and EC: ∠DEC.

- Between EC and EB: ∠BEC.

Wait, but how are these arranged?

Actually, when two lines cross, they create two pairs of vertical angles. So if line BD crosses line AC at E, then the angles:

- ∠AEB and ∠CED are vertical angles.

- ∠AED and ∠BEC are vertical angles.

So, if ∠AEB is 33°, then ∠CED is also 33°. Then, the other two angles ∠AED and ∠BEC are equal. Their sum plus the sum of the two 33s equals 360°, so:

∠AED + ∠BEC = 360 - 2*33 = 294°, and since they're equal, each is 147°, so ∠AED = 147°, ∠BEC = 147°.

But then in triangle AED, we have angles:

∠EDA = 95°, ∠AED = 147°, and ∠DAE = ?. Adding up to 180°, gives:

95 + 147 + ∠DAE = 180 → ∠DAE = 180 - 242 = -62°, which is impossible.

This suggests that there's a fundamental error in my assumptions. Where is the mistake?

Ah! Wait, maybe the angle ∠EDA is not part of triangle AED. Let me confirm.

∠EDA is the angle at D between E and A. So that would be ∠ADE in triangle ADE. So in triangle ADE, the angles are:

At D: ∠EDA = 95°,

At E: ∠AED = 147°,

At A: ∠DAE.

Sum should be 180°, but adding 95 + 147 = 242, which is already over 180. Hence, impossible. So there's a contradiction here.

This implies that my previous conclusion that ∠AED = 147° is incorrect. How?

Maybe my identification of vertical angles is wrong. Let me double-check the vertical angles.

When two lines intersect, the vertical angles are opposite each other. Suppose lines AC and BD intersect at E. So the angles at E are:

- The angle between AE and BE: ∠AEB = 33°.

- The angle between BE and CE: let's say ∠BEC.

- The angle between CE and DE: ∠CED.

- The angle between DE and AE: ∠DEA.

Wait, but this depends on the order of the points. Let me try to define the positions:

Assume that E is the intersection of AC and BD. Let me suppose that on line AC, from left to right: A --- E --- C. On line BD, from bottom to top: B --- E --- D.

So at point E, the lines AC and BD cross. The angles around E are:

- Between BA and ED: this would be ∠AEB (from A to E to B?), no. Wait, need to think carefully.

Actually, the angles around E are:

1. Between BA and ED: but BA is part of line AB, and ED is part of BD. Depending on the direction.

Alternatively, perhaps I should assign coordinates to make it clearer.

Let me try assigning coordinates to points to model this scenario. Let me assume coordinates for simplicity.

Let me place point E at origin (0,0). Let me assume line AC is horizontal, with E at (0,0). Let me set point A to the left of E, say at (-a, 0), and point C to the right at (c, 0), where a and c are positive numbers.

Line BD passes through E. Let me assume BD is some line through E. Let me define points B and D such that E lies on BD. Let me pick coordinates for B and D. For simplicity, let me take BD to be vertical, so that line BD is the y-axis. So point B is at (0, b) and D is at (0, d), with b < 0 and d > 0, so that E=(0,0) is between B and D.

Now, with this coordinate system, let me compute the angles.

First, given that ∠(E, D, A) = 95°, which is ∠EDA. Let me find this angle. Point D is at (0,d), E is at (0,0), and A is at (-a, 0). So vector ED is from E to D: (0,d)-(0,0) = (0,d). Vector EA is from E to A: (-a,0)-(0,0) = (-a,0). So angle between ED (upward vertical) and EA (leftward horizontal) is 90° + 90°? Wait, the angle between upward vertical and leftward horizontal is 90° + 90°? No. Wait, the angle between ED (pointing upwards) and EA (pointing to the left) is measured at point D? Wait, no. ∠EDA is the angle at D between E and A. So the angle at D between points E, D, A.

So point D is at (0,d). The angle ∠EDA is formed at D by points E, D, A. So vectors DE and DA.

Vector DE is from D to E: E - D = (0 - 0, 0 - d) = (0, -d).

Vector DA is from D to A: A - D = (-a - 0, 0 - d) = (-a, -d).

So angle between vectors DE (downward vertical) and DA (vector to A from D). To find ∠EDA, which is the angle between DE and DA at D.

Using coordinates, we can calculate this angle.

The formula for the angle between two vectors u and v is:

cosθ = (u · v)/(|u| |v|)

Vector DE = (0, -d), vector DA = (-a, -d).

Their dot product: (0)(-a) + (-d)(-d) = d².

|DE| = sqrt(0² + (-d)^2) = d.

|DA| = sqrt((-a)^2 + (-d)^2) = sqrt(a² + d²).

So cosθ = d² / [d * sqrt(a² + d²)] ) = d / sqrt(a² + d²).

Therefore, θ = arccos(d / sqrt(a² + d²)).

Which simplifies to θ = arctan(a/d). Because tanθ = opposite/adjacent = a/d. Wait, since if you imagine a right triangle with legs a and d, then the angle opposite a is arctan(a/d). So θ = arctan(a/d).

But according to the problem, this angle ∠EDA is 95°, so arctan(a/d) = 95°, which implies a/d = tan(95°). But tan(95°) is tan(90° + 5°) = -cot(5°), which is negative. But a and d are lengths, so a/d is positive. So this suggests inconsistency. Wait, what's happening?

Wait, angle between DE and DA at D is supposed to be 95°, which is obtuse. But arctan(a/d) would give an acute angle. So there's a miscalculation here.

Wait, the angle between DE and DA is actually the angle between DE (pointing downward) and DA (pointing to A). Depending on the direction, this could be obtuse. Let me think again.

The angle at D between DE and DA is computed as follows. If vector DE is pointing downward (from D to E), and vector DA is pointing to A (from D to A). So if a is positive (since A is to the left of E), then DA is pointing to the left and downward. DE is pointing straight down. So the angle between DA and DE would be the angle between a vector pointing to the left-down and straight down. So that angle would be 90° minus the angle between DA and the vertical.

Wait, maybe I should use the actual calculation.

Given vectors DE = (0,-d) and DA = (-a,-d). The angle between them is calculated as:

cosθ = (DE · DA)/( |DE||DA| )

DE · DA = 0*(-a) + (-d)*(-d) = d²

|DE| = d

|DA| = sqrt(a² + d²)

so cosθ = d² / [d * sqrt(a² + d²)] = d / sqrt(a² + d²)

Thus θ = arccos(d / sqrt(a² + d²)).

Let me compute this value numerically. Suppose we set a and d such that this angle is 95°. Let me solve for tan(theta):

tan(theta) = sin(theta)/cos(theta). But theta is the angle between DE and DA, which we've expressed as arccos(d / sqrt(a² + d²)). Let me express tan(theta):

Let me denote t = d / sqrt(a² + d²). Then cos(theta) = t. So sin(theta) = sqrt(1 - t²) = sqrt(1 - d²/(a² + d²)) = sqrt(a² / (a² + d²)) = a / sqrt(a² + d²). Therefore tan(theta) = [a / sqrt(...)] / [d / sqrt(...)] = a/d. So tan(theta) = a/d. Therefore, theta = arctan(a/d). But theta is given as 95°, so:

arctan(a/d) = 95° ⇒ a/d = tan(95°)

But tan(95°) is tan(90° + 5°) = -cot(5°) ≈ -11.430. But a/d is positive, so this suggests that theta is actually 180° - 95° = 85°, because tangent is periodic with period 180°, and arctan returns values between -90° and 90°. So if the actual angle is 95°, which is in second quadrant, then the reference angle is 95° - 90° = 5°, and tan(95°) = tan(π/2 + 5°) = -cot(5°). So the magnitude is cot(5°), and the angle is 95°, meaning that a/d = cot(5°) ≈ 11.430. So a/d = cot(5°) ≈ 11.43.

So this gives us a relation between a and d: a = d * cot(5°). Let's keep that in mind.

Now, let's move to other given angles. For example, ∠(B, C, E) = 109°, which is ∠BCE. Let me find this angle.

Point B is at (0,b), point C is at (c,0), point E is at (0,0). So ∠BCE is the angle at point C between points B, C, E.

So vectors CB and CE.

Vector CB is B - C = (0 - c, b - 0) = (-c, b).

Vector CE is E - C = (0 - c, 0 - 0) = (-c, 0).

So angle between vectors CB and CE at point C.

Compute this angle.

Vectors CB = (-c, b), CE = (-c, 0).

Dot product: (-c)(-c) + (b)(0) = c².

|CB| = sqrt(c² + b²)

|CE| = sqrt(c² + 0) = c.

So cos(theta) = c² / [sqrt(c² + b²) * c] = c / sqrt(c² + b²).

Thus, theta = arccos(c / sqrt(b² + c²)) = arctan(b/c). Similar to before.

So ∠BCE = arctan(b/c) = 109°. Wait, but arctan(b/c) is an angle between 0° and 90°, since b and c are real numbers. But the given angle is 109°, which is obtuse. So similar to before, this suggests that the angle is actually 180° - arctan(b/c) = 109°, implying arctan(b/c) = 180° - 109° = 71°, so b/c = tan(71°) ≈ 2.904.

Thus, b = c * tan(71°).

So now we have relations between a, d, b, c.

From earlier, a/d = cot(5°) ≈ 11.430, so a = d * cot(5°).

And b = c * tan(71°).

Now, let's consider other angles. For example, ∠(E, A, B) = 33°, which is ∠EAB. This is the angle at A between E and B.

Point E is at (0,0), point A is at (-a,0), point B is at (0,b). So ∠EAB is the angle at A between points E, A, B.

So vectors AE and AB.

Vector AE is from A to E: E - A = (0 - (-a), 0 - 0) = (a, 0).

Vector AB is from A to B: B - A = (0 - (-a), b - 0) = (a, b).

So the angle between vectors AE (along positive x-axis) and AB (to point B).

This angle is ∠EAB, which is given as 33°.

So the angle between vector AE (along x-axis) and AB (vector (a, b)) is 33°. So tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent = b/a.

Because if you consider vector AB making an angle of 33° with the x-axis (AE), then tan(theta) = (change in y)/(change in x) = b/a.

Thus, tan(33°) = b/a.

But earlier, we have b = c * tan(71°), and a = d * cot(5°). So substituting:

tan(33°) = [c * tan(71°)] / [d * cot(5°)].

But I don't know c and d yet. However, we might need to relate variables further.

Also, we have ∠(A, B, E) = 24°, which is ∠ABE. This is the angle at B between A and E.

Point A is at (-a, 0), point B is at (0, b), point E is at (0,0). So ∠ABE is the angle at B between A, B, E.

Vectors BA and BE.

Vector BA is from B to A: A - B = (-a - 0, 0 - b) = (-a, -b).

Vector BE is from B to E: E - B = (0 - 0, 0 - b) = (0, -b).

So the angle between BA and BE at point B.

Let me compute this angle. Using vectors BA = (-a, -b) and BE = (0, -b).

Dot product: (-a)(0) + (-b)(-b) = b².

|BA| = sqrt(a² + b²)

|BE| = sqrt(0² + (-b)^2) = |b| = b (assuming b positive).

Thus, cos(theta) = b² / [sqrt(a² + b²) * b] = b / sqrt(a² + b²).

So theta = arccos(b / sqrt(a² + b²)) = arctan(a/b).

Given that ∠ABE = 24°, so arctan(a/b) = 24°, thus a/b = tan(24°).

So now we have:

From earlier:

1. a/d = cot(5°) ⇒ a = d * cot(5°)

2. b = c * tan(71°)

3. tan(33°) = (b/a) = [c * tan(71°)] / [d * cot(5°)]

4. a/b = tan(24°) ⇒ a = b * tan(24°)

From equation 4: a = b * tan(24°). Substitute into equation 3:

tan(33°) = [c * tan(71°)] / [d * cot(5°)].

But from equation 1: a = d * cot(5°), so d = a / cot(5°) = a * tan(5°). Substitute d into equation 3:

tan(33°) = [c * tan(71°)] / [a * tan(5°)].

But from equation 4: a = b * tan(24°), so substitute a:

tan(33°) = [c * tan(71°)] / [b * tan(24°) * tan(5°)].

But we need to relate c and b. Recall from equation 2: b = c * tan(71°), so c = b / tan(71°). Substitute into above:

tan(33°) = [ (b / tan(71°)) * tan(71°) ] / [b * tan(24°) * tan(5°) ]

Simplify numerator: [b / tan(71°) * tan(71°)] = b.

Denominator: b * tan(24°) * tan(5°)

Thus:

tan(33°) = b / [b * tan(24°) * tan(5°)] = 1 / [tan(24°) * tan(5°)]

Calculate RHS: 1 / [tan(24°) * tan(5°)].

Let me compute tan(24°) ≈ 0.4452, tan(5°) ≈ 0.0875. Multiply them: 0.4452 * 0.0875 ≈ 0.0389. So 1 / 0.0389 ≈ 25.7. But tan(33°) ≈ 0.6494, which is nowhere near 25.7. So this suggests inconsistency again.

Hmm, this indicates that my assumptions are leading to contradictions. Perhaps there's a mistake in the setup.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the angle ∠ABE. Let me recheck.

∠ABE is the angle at B between A and E. Vectors BA and BE.

Vector BA is from B to A: A - B = (-a, -b).

Vector BE is from B to E: E - B = (0, -b).

So the angle between BA and BE. The cosine of this angle is (BA · BE)/(|BA||BE|) = [(-a)(0) + (-b)(-b)] / [sqrt(a² + b²) * |BE|] = b² / [sqrt(a² + b²) * b] = b / sqrt(a² + b²). As before.

So the angle is arccos(b / sqrt(a² + b²)) = arctan(a/b). Which is what I had before. So if this angle is 24°, then arctan(a/b) = 24°, so a/b = tan(24°).

So far so good. But combining with other equations leads to inconsistency. So perhaps my initial assumption of the configuration is wrong.

Alternative approach: Maybe the issue is that I assumed BD is vertical and AC horizontal, but the actual configuration might require different orientations. Perhaps I need to use the Law of Sines or Cosines in some triangles.

Let me try to focus on triangle ABE, where we know two angles: ∠ABE = 24°, ∠AEB = 33°, giving ∠BAE = 123°, as before. Then, in triangle ABE, sides are proportional to the sine of opposite angles.

Let me denote:

In triangle ABE:

∠ABE = 24°, ∠BAE = 123°, ∠AEB = 33°.

Using the Law of Sines:

AB / sin(∠AEB) = BE / sin(∠BAE) = AE / sin(∠ABE)

So AB / sin(33°) = BE / sin(123°) = AE / sin(24°)

Let me denote AB = c, BE = a, AE = b (for easier notation).

Then, c / sin(33°) = a / sin(123°) = b / sin(24°).

But without specific lengths, this might not help directly. However, perhaps relating AE and BE.

But how does this connect to other parts?

Also, recall that E lies on AC, so AE + EC = AC. But without knowing AC length, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, consider triangle AED, where we had issues before. Let me try to revisit it with corrected understanding.

Previously, I thought ∠EDA = 95°, but in reality, depending on the configuration, this angle might be external or internal.

Wait, maybe my earlier calculation for ∠EDA was incorrect. Let me try again.

In triangle ADE, if we can find two angles, we can find the third. But previously, I assumed ∠AED = 147°, which led to a contradiction. Perhaps that assumption is wrong.

Wait, earlier, I thought that ∠AED = 147° because of the vertical angles. But if that leads to inconsistency, perhaps the mistake is in assuming that ∠AED is part of triangle ADE. Let me think: ∠AED is at point E, so it's part of triangle ADE? Yes, because ADE has vertices A, D, E. So ∠AED is at E, between A and D. So yes, part of triangle ADE.

But if in triangle ADE, ∠EDA = 95°, ∠AED = ?, and ∠DAE = ?, and their sum is 180°, but earlier calculation suggested ∠AED = 147°, leading to negative ∠DAE. This suggests that either the value of ∠AED is not 147°, or my identification of the angles around E is incorrect.

Let me reconsider the angles around point E.

Given that lines AC and BD intersect at E. Let me use the fact that the sum of angles around E is 360°. We know ∠AEB = 33°, and we need to find the other angles.

If I can find another angle related to ∠AED, maybe through triangle ADE or other triangles.

Alternatively, perhaps using triangle BEC. Given that ∠BEC = 147° (if my previous assumption was correct), but this led to issues. Let me explore this.

In triangle BEC, we know ∠BEC = 147°, and we might know other angles. For example, ∠BCE = 109°, as given. Wait, ∠BCE is the angle at C between B and E, which is part of triangle BCE.

Wait, in triangle BCE, we have ∠BEC = 147°, ∠BCE = 109°, so the third angle at B, ∠EBC, would be 180 - 147 - 109 = -76°, which is impossible. Another contradiction!

This suggests that my assumption about ∠BEC being 147° is wrong. So what's wrong here?

Perhaps the initial assumption that ∠AED and ∠BEC are vertical angles is incorrect. Maybe they are not vertical angles. Let me think again.

When two lines intersect, vertical angles are opposite each other. If lines AC and BD intersect at E, then the vertical angles are:

- The angle between AE and BE (which is ∠AEB = 33°) and the angle between CE and DE (which is ∠CED).

- The angle between BE and DE (which is ∠BED) and the angle between AE and CE (which is ∠AEC).

Wait, this changes things. Earlier, I incorrectly identified ∠AED and ∠BEC as vertical angles, but they might not be. Let me correct this.

At point E, the four angles formed by intersecting lines AC and BD are:

1. Between AE and BE: ∠AEB = 33°.

2. Between BE and DE: ∠BED.

3. Between DE and CE: ∠CED.

4. Between CE and AE: ∠AEC.

Vertical angles are across from each other. So ∠AEB and ∠CED are vertical angles. ∠BED and ∠AEC are vertical angles.

Thus, ∠AEB = ∠CED = 33°, and ∠BED = ∠AEC.

So, the sum of all angles around E is:

∠AEB + ∠BED + ∠CED + ∠AEC = 33 + ∠BED + 33 + ∠BED = 66 + 2∠BED = 360°

So 2∠BED = 360 - 66 = 294° → ∠BED = 147°. Thus, ∠AEC = 147°.

So now, ∠AED is not directly one of these angles. Wait, ∠AED is the angle at E between A and D. Which would be ∠AED = ∠AEC + ∠CED? No, depending on the arrangement.

Wait, ∠AED is the angle at E between A and D. Let me think: if line AC passes through E, and line BD passes through E, then from point E, the angle between A and D would depend on the direction of BD.

Assuming that from E, line BD goes to B and D. So if I am at point E, and want to find ∠AED, it would be the angle between EA and ED. Which is part of the angles around E.

But in the current setup, the angles at E are:

- Between AE and BE: 33°.

- Between BE and DE: ∠BED = 147°.

- Between DE and CE: 33°.

- Between CE and AE: 147°.

Wait, so the angle between AE and DE would be ∠AED = ∠AEB + ∠BED? No, if you go from AE to BE to DE, the angle from AE to DE is ∠AEB + ∠BED? No, that would be if they were adjacent. Wait, from AE to BE is 33°, then from BE to DE is 147°, so the total angle from AE to DE is 33 + 147 = 180°, which would mean that AE and DE are in a straight line, which would imply that D is on the extension of AE, but that contradicts E being on AC and BD. So this suggests another contradiction.

Clearly, there's confusion in how the angles are arranged. Perhaps drawing a diagram would help, but since I can't draw, I'll try to think differently.

Let me focus on triangle ADE. We know ∠EDA = 95°, and we need to find ∠DAE (which is angle 2). If I can find ∠AED, then I can compute ∠DAE.

But how to find ∠AED?

∠AED is the angle at E between A and D. This is part of the angles around E. From earlier, we have ∠AEB = 33°, and ∠BED = 147°. If I can find how ∠AED relates to these.

If I consider the path from AE to DE, it would pass through BE. So ∠AED = ∠AEB + ∠BED? No, that would be if BE is between AE and DE. If ∠AEB is between AE and BE, and ∠BED is between BE and DE, then ∠AED = ∠AEB + ∠BED = 33° + 147° = 180°, which would mean that points A, E, D are colinear, which cannot be since E is on AC and D is on BD. So this suggests that my assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, if ∠AED is the supplement of ∠BED? Or some other relationship.

Wait, if ∠AED is the angle at E between A and D, and if the lines AC and BD intersect at E, then ∠AED is supplementary to ∠BEC or something else.

Wait, let me think about the full circle around E. We have:

∠AEB = 33°, ∠BED = 147°, ∠CED = 33°, and ∠AEC = 147°.

Now, ∠AED is the angle between EA and ED. If I follow from EA to ED, it would go through BE or not? It depends on the position of D.

Assuming that D is on the other side of E from B, then from EA to ED would pass through BE and ED, so ∠AED = ∠AEB + ∠BED = 33 + 147 = 180°, which implies that A, E, D are collinear, which is impossible because D is on BD and E is on BD, so D is on the line BD, and E is between B and D. So if D is on BD, then ED is part of BD. So from E, line ED goes to D, which is on BD. Line EA is part of AC. So the angle between ED (which is part of BD) and EA (part of AC) is ∠AED.

So ∠AED is the angle between BD and AC at E. Which is the same as ∠AEB + ∠BED? Or is it ∠AEB + ∠BED if D is on one side?

Wait, if D is on the line BD, and E is between B and D, then from E, the line ED is extending in the direction from E to D, which is away from B. So the angle between ED and EA (which is part of AC) would be ∠AED. This angle is adjacent to ∠AEB and ∠BED?

No, it's part of the angles around E. Let me think of it as follows: at point E, the lines AC and BD intersect. The angle between AC (EA) and BD (ED) is ∠AED. This angle is supplementary to ∠AEB if they are on a straight line. Wait, no. If AC and BD intersect at E, then the angle between AC and BD at E is ∠AED and ∠BEC, which are vertical angles. Wait, no. If AC and BD intersect at E, then the angle between AC and BD at E is ∠AEB and ∠CED, which are vertical angles. The other pair is ∠AED and ∠BEC.

Wait, this brings us back to the original vertical angles. So ∠AED = ∠BEC. Earlier, we thought ∠BEC is 147°, but that led to contradictions in other triangles.

Let me try to calculate ∠BEC. In triangle BEC, if we can find two angles, we can find the third.

We know ∠BCE = 109° (given), and if we can find ∠EBC, then ∠BEC = 180 - ∠BCE - ∠EBC.

But ∠EBC is part of triangle ABE, where ∠ABE = 24°. Wait, ∠ABE is at B between A and E, and ∠EBC is at B between E and C. Are these angles adjacent?

Yes! At point B, the angles ∠ABE and ∠EBC are adjacent, forming ∠ABC. So ∠ABE + ∠EBC = ∠ABC.

But we don't know ∠ABC. However, if we can find ∠EBC, we can find ∠BEC.

But how?

Wait, in triangle ABE, we have ∠ABE = 24°, ∠BAE = 123°, ∠AEB = 33°. If we can find ∠EBC, it might relate to other parts.

But ∠EBC is part of triangle BEC. Let me try to find it.

If I can find ∠EBC, then in triangle BEC, ∠BEC = 180 - 109 - ∠EBC.

But how to find ∠EBC?

∠EBC is the angle at B between E and C. This is the same as ∠EBC = ∠ABE + ∠ABC? No, ∠EBC is part of ∠ABC. Wait, if we consider line BC, then ∠ABE is part of it?

Wait, point C is on line AC, and E is on AC. So line BE connects B to E on AC. So at point B, the line BE goes to E on AC, and line BC goes to C. So ∠EBC is the angle at B between E and C, which is part of triangle BEC.

But how to find this angle?

Maybe using the Law of Sines in triangle ABE and triangle BEC.

From triangle ABE, we have:

AB / sin(33°) = BE / sin(123°) = AE / sin(24°)

Let me denote AB = c, BE = a, AE = b.

So, c / sin(33°) = a / sin(123°) = b / sin(24°)

Let me calculate the ratios.

Let me assume a unit length for simplicity. Let's say AE = 1 (b = 1). Then, from the ratio b / sin(24°) = 1 / sin(24°), so a = [sin(123°) / sin(24°)] * b = [sin(123°) / sin(24°)] * 1 ≈ [sin(123°) / sin(24°)].

Calculating sin(123°): sin(123°) = sin(180° - 57°) = sin(57°) ≈ 0.8387.

Sin(24°) ≈ 0.4067.

So a ≈ 0.8387 / 0.4067 ≈ 2.063.

So BE ≈ 2.063.

Now, in triangle BEC, we have ∠BCE = 109°, BE ≈ 2.063, and we need to find ∠EBC.

But we need more information about the triangle BEC. If we can find BC or EC, we could apply the Law of Sines or Cosines.

But how?

EC is part of AC. From earlier, AE = 1, and EC = AC - AE. But without knowing AC, it's difficult.

However, if we can relate EC to other parts.

Wait, from triangle ABE, we have AE = 1, and from the Law of Sines, AB / sin(33°) = 1 / sin(24°). So AB = [sin(33°) / sin(24°)] * 1 ≈ [0.5446 / 0.4067] ≈ 1.339.

So AB ≈ 1.339.

Now, consider triangle ABC. If we can find BC or other sides, but we don't have enough info.

Alternatively, consider triangle BEC. If we can find BC, but I don't see a direct way.

Wait, but maybe using the Law of Sines in triangle BEC. Let me denote:

In triangle BEC, ∠BCE = 109°, ∠EBC = x, ∠BEC = y.

So x + y + 109 = 180 → x + y = 71°.

But we need more info to find x or y.

If we can relate BE and EC.

From earlier, in triangle ABE, we have AE = 1, and in triangle AED, if we can relate ED to other parts.

Alternatively, consider that E is on AC, so EC = AC - AE. If I can find AC, but how?

Wait, if I can find AC from triangle ABE and other parts.

But this seems too vague. Let me try another approach.

Let me consider the entire diagram and try to use the given angles to find relations.

We have several angles given:

- ∠BCE = 109°

- ∠ABE = 24°

- ∠AEB = 33°

- ∠EDA = 95°

- ∠EAB = 123° (from earlier)

- ∠ABE = 24°

- ∠AEB = 33°

- ∠EDA = 95°

Let me try to find ∠DAE (which is angle 2).

In triangle ADE, if I can find ∠AED and ∠EDA, then I can find ∠DAE.

We know ∠EDA = 95°, and need ∠AED.

To find ∠AED, let's consider it is part of the angles around E. If I can determine it from other parts.

From earlier, we have ∠AEB = 33°, and if we can find ∠BED, then ∠AED = ∠AEB + ∠BED or something similar.

But how?

Let me think about triangle BED. If I can find some angles there.

In triangle BED, we know ∠BED = 147° (from earlier calculation, assuming ∠BED = 147°), but this led to contradictions. Let me try to use it.

If ∠BED = 147°, and in triangle BED, if I can find other angles.

But I don't know any other angles in triangle BED. Unless I can relate it to other parts.

Alternatively, let me consider that ∠AED is the angle we need, and it is supplementary to ∠BEC, since they are vertical angles.

Wait, if ∠AED and ∠BEC are vertical angles, then they are equal. So if I can find ∠BEC, I can find ∠AED.

To find ∠BEC, consider triangle BEC, where ∠BCE = 109°, and if I can find ∠EBC or ∠BEC.

But how?

Let me try to use the Law of Sines in triangle ABE and triangle BEC.

From triangle ABE, we have:

AB / sin(∠AEB) = BE / sin(∠BAE) = AE / sin(∠ABE)

As before, let me denote AE = 1, ∠ABE = 24°, ∠AEB = 33°, ∠BAE = 123°.

So AB = [sin(33°) / sin(24°)] * AE ≈ [0.5446 / 0.4067] * 1 ≈ 1.339.

BE = [sin(123°) / sin(24°)] * AE ≈ [0.8387 / 0.4067] * 1 ≈ 2.063.

Now, in triangle BEC, we have BE ≈ 2.063, ∠BCE = 109°, and we need to find ∠BEC or ∠EBC.

If I can find EC, I can use the Law of Sines.

But how to find EC?

EC is part of AC. From triangle ABE, we have AE = 1, and if we can find AC, but how?

Wait, if I consider triangle ABE and triangle ADE, but I don't have enough info.

Alternatively, let me consider that in triangle ADE, ∠EDA = 95°, ∠DAE = angle 2, and ∠AED = ?

If I can find ∠AED, then I can find angle 2.

But how to find ∠AED?

If ∠AED is equal to ∠BEC (vertical angles), and if I can find ∠BEC from triangle BEC.

In triangle BEC, ∠BEC = 180 - ∠BCE - ∠EBC = 180 - 109 - ∠EBC = 71 - ∠EBC.

But ∠EBC is part of ∠ABE + ...?

Wait, ∠EBC is the angle at B between E and C. This is the same as ∠EBC = ∠ABE + ∠ABC? No, ∠ABE is part of ∠ABC if C is on the same line as B.

Wait, point C is on line AC, and E is on AC. So line BE connects B to E on AC. So at point B, the angle between BE and BC is ∠EBC, and the angle between BE and BA is ∠ABE = 24°. So ∠ABC = ∠ABE + ∠EBC.

But we don't know ∠ABC. However, if we can find ∠ABC from elsewhere.

Alternatively, consider triangle ABC. In triangle ABC, we have ∠ABC, ∠BAC, and ∠BCA.

We know ∠BAC is composed of ∠BAE (123°) and ∠EAC. Wait, ∠BAC is the angle at A between B and C. Since E is on AC, ∠BAC = ∠BAE + ∠EAC. But ∠EAC is part of ∠DAC, which is angle 2.

Wait, ∠DAC is the angle at A between D and C, which is ∠DAE (since E is on AC). So ∠DAC = ∠DAE = angle 2.

But ∠BAC = ∠BAE + ∠EAC = 123° + ∠EAC.

But ∠EAC is the angle at A between E and C, which is part of line AC. So ∠EAC is zero? No, because E is on AC, so ∠EAC is zero? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, ∠BAC is the angle at A between B and C. Since E is on AC, then ∠BAC is the angle between AB and AC. Which is the same as ∠BAE + ∠EAC, where ∠EAC is the angle between EA and AC, which is zero because E is on AC. So ∠BAC = ∠BAE = 123°. Wait, but that would mean that ∠BAC is 123°, and in triangle ABC, the angles are:

∠BAC = 123°, ∠ABC = ?, ∠BCA = ?

But we know ∠BCA is ∠BCE + ∠ECA. Wait, ∠BCA is the angle at C between B and A. Since E is on AC, ∠BCA = ∠BCE + ∠ECA. But ∠ECA is part of line EC, so ∠ECA is zero? No, it's the angle at C between E and A, which is zero because E is on AC. So ∠BCA = ∠BCE = 109°.

Wait, this suggests that in triangle ABC, angles are:

∠BAC = 123°, ∠BCA = 109°, so ∠ABC = 180 - 123 - 109 = -52°, which is impossible. Another contradiction!

This indicates that there's a fundamental flaw in the assumptions, likely due to misinterpretation of the angles or their relationships.

Given the time spent and recurring contradictions, perhaps I should consider that the measure of angle 2 is 28°, which is option C, as a plausible guess, but I need to justify it.

Wait, let me try one last approach. Let's assume that angle 2 is 28°, and see if it fits.

If angle 2 is ∠DAC = 28°, then in triangle ADE, we have ∠EDA = 95°, ∠DAE = 28°, so ∠AED = 180 - 95 - 28 = 57°.

If ∠AED = 57°, then since it is equal to ∠BEC (vertical angles), ∠BEC = 57°.

In triangle BEC, ∠BCE = 109°, ∠BEC = 57°, so ∠EBC = 180 - 109 - 57 = 14°.

Now, at point B, ∠ABE = 24°, and ∠EBC = 14°, so ∠ABC = 24 + 14 = 38°.

Now, in triangle ABC, angles are ∠BAC = 123°, ∠ABC = 38°, ∠BCA = 109°, sum is 123 + 38 + 109 = 270°, which is not 180°. Still impossible.

But if ∠AED = 57°, and ∠AED is part of the angles around E, then the sum of angles around E would be ∠AEB + ∠BED + ∠CED + ∠AEC = 33 + ∠BED + 33 + ∠AEC = 66 + ∠BED + ∠AEC = 360. If ∠AED = 57°, and ∠AED is part of ∠AEC or ∠BED?

This is getting too convoluted. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll have to make an educated guess based on common angle values.

Looking at the answer choices: 23, 24, 28, 33. Given that ∠ABE = 24°, and angle 2 is likely related to other angles, perhaps 28° is the correct answer. Alternatively, since ∠EDA = 95°, and other angles, maybe 28° is derived from 180 - 95 - 57 = 28, but this is speculative.

Alternatively, using the earlier calculation where tan(33°) = 1 / [tan(24°) * tan(5°)] ≈ 25.7, but tan(33°) ≈ 0.6494, which is not matching, but if I adjust, maybe there's a relationship.

Alternatively, if angle 2 is 28°, then in triangle ADE, ∠DAE = 28°, ∠EDA = 95°, so ∠AED = 57°, and this would mean that ∠BEC = 57°, leading to ∠EBC = 14°, and ∠ABC = 24 + 14 = 38°, and in triangle ABC, ∠BAC = 123°, ∠ABC = 38°, ∠BCA = 109°, sum 123+38+109 = 270, which is still wrong, but maybe there's a miscalculation.

Wait, maybe ∠BAC is not 123°. Earlier, I thought ∠BAE = 123°, which is part of ∠BAC. But if E is on AC, then ∠BAC = ∠BAE, because E is on AC. So ∠BAC = 123°, which would make triangle ABC have angles 123°, 38°, and 109°, totaling 270°, which is impossible. This suggests that there's an error in assuming ∠BAE = 123°.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of ∠BAE in triangle ABE.

In triangle ABE, angles are ∠ABE = 24°, ∠AEB = 33°, so ∠BAE = 180 - 24 - 33 = 123°. This is correct.

But if ∠BAE is 123°, and E is on AC, then ∠BAC = ∠BAE = 123°, which leads to the impossible triangle ABC. This suggests that the given constraints are inconsistent, or there's a misinterpretation of the angles.

Given the time I've invested without resolving the contradiction, and considering that in the absence of a clear path, the most plausible answer among the choices is C. 28°, as it is a common angle in such problems, or possibly 24°, but since 24 is already given as ∠ABE, maybe 28 is the correct choice.

### ✅ **Key Information from the Problem**

We are told:
