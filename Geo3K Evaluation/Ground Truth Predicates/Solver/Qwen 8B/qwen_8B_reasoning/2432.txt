====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to visualize the figure based on the given constraints. Let me list out all the information provided:

- The length of line EB is 16 units.
- The length of line AE is 9 units.
- Lines EB and EA are perpendicular.
- Lines BE and BD are perpendicular (so BD is perpendicular to BE).
- Lines DA and DB are perpendicular (DA is perpendicular to DB).
- Lines AE and AD are perpendicular (AE is perpendicular to AD).

Hmm, so there are several right angles here. Maybe it's helpful to draw coordinates for points to make sense of this? Coordinates might help because dealing with perpendicular lines can be easier with slopes or coordinate geometry.

Let me start by placing point E at the origin since we have two perpendicular lines meeting there. If I set E at (0, 0), then since AE is 9 units long and perpendicular to EB, which is 16 units. Let me assume that EA is along the y-axis and EB is along the x-axis. That way, they are perpendicular.

So, point E is (0, 0). Then, point A would be somewhere along the y-axis. Since the length of AE is 9, then A could be at (0, 9) or (0, -9). Similarly, point B would be along the x-axis. Since EB is 16, then B is at (16, 0) or (-16, 0). But maybe direction matters. Let me pick positive directions for simplicity. So let me say A is at (0, 9) and B is at (16, 0).

Now, looking at the next constraints. Perpendicular(Line(BE), Line(BD)). Wait, BE is the same as EB, which is the line from B to E. Since BE is horizontal (from (16,0) to (0,0)), then BD should be vertical? Because it's perpendicular to BE. So BD is vertical. Therefore, point D lies somewhere along the vertical line passing through B. Wait, but BD is connected to B. So starting at B (16, 0), moving vertically upwards or downwards. Let me think.

But also, there's another condition: Perpendicular(Line(DA), Line(DB)). So DA is perpendicular to DB. Also, Perpendicular(Line(AE), Line(AD)). Since AE is vertical (from A(0,9) to E(0,0)), then AD must be horizontal? Because AE is vertical, so AD has to be horizontal to be perpendicular. Wait, no. Wait, the line AE is vertical, so line AD must be horizontal? Or wait, the line AD is perpendicular to AE. Since AE is vertical, then AD must be horizontal. So AD is horizontal. Therefore, point D must lie somewhere such that when you connect A to D, it's horizontal. Since A is at (0,9), a horizontal line from A would be along y=9. Therefore, point D must lie on the line y=9. 

Wait, but earlier we said that BD is vertical. So BD is vertical, meaning that D lies directly above or below B. But since B is at (16, 0), BD being vertical implies D is at (16, k) for some k. However, AD is horizontal. Since A is at (0,9), and D is at (16, k), then the line AD connects (0,9) to (16,k). For AD to be horizontal, the y-coordinate of D must be equal to the y-coordinate of A. Therefore, k = 9. So D is at (16, 9). 

Wait, let me check that. If D is at (1,9), then AD would go from (0,9) to (1,9), which is horizontal. But BD is from (16,0) to (16,9), which is vertical. That satisfies the perpendicularity between BD and BE (since BE is horizontal). Also, DA is horizontal, which is perpendicular to AE (which is vertical). Perfect. 

So D is at (16, 9). Now, check the other condition: Perpendicular(Line(DA), Line(DB)). Wait, DA is horizontal from (0,9) to (16,9), and DB is vertical from (16,0) to (16,9). Are these lines perpendicular? Well, DA is horizontal, DB is vertical, so yes, they are perpendicular. So that checks out.

So now, all points are determined? Let me recap:

- E: (0, 0)
- A: (0, 9)
- B: (16, 0)
- D: (16, 9)

So connecting these points. The figure formed by these points... What shape is this?

Looking at the connections: Points A(0,9), B(16,0), D(16,9), and E(0,0). Connecting them in order? Or maybe quadrilateral AEDB? Wait, perhaps the figure is a rectangle? Let me see.

From E(0,0) to A(0,9): vertical line up.

From A(0,9) to D(16,9): horizontal line right.

From D(16,9) to B(16,0): vertical line down.

From B(16,0) back to E(0,0): horizontal line left.

Wait, that makes a rectangle! Because all angles are right angles. So the figure is a rectangle with vertices at E(0,0), A(0,9), D(16,9), and B(16,0). Therefore, the area would be length times width. The length from E to B is 16 units (horizontal side), and the height from E to A is 9 units (vertical side). Therefore, area is 16 * 9 = 144. But wait, that would make the area 144. However, the answer choices include 144 as option D. But let me double-check if this is correct.

Wait, but the question says "the area of the figure". Is the figure just the rectangle? Or is there more to it? Let me check again the constraints. The problem mentions lines EB, EA, BD, DA, etc., but does that form only the rectangle? Or are there other parts?

Alternatively, maybe the figure refers to something else. Wait, but according to the given constraints, all the points are connected as per those lines. Let me confirm once again:

- Line EB: from E(0,0) to B(16,0)
- Line EA: from E(0,0) to A(0,9)
- Line BD: from B(16,0) to D(16,9)
- Line DA: from D(16,9) to A(0,9)
  
These four lines form a rectangle. So the area of the rectangle would indeed be 16*9=144. But looking at the answer choices, D is 144. But wait, sometimes problems may refer to different figures. Let me check if there's a possibility of a different interpretation.

Wait, another thought: Could the figure be made of multiple shapes? For example, triangles? Let me think again. Suppose the figure is composed of triangle EAB and some other areas? But according to the constraints, all the lines mentioned are part of the figure. Alternatively, maybe the figure is a square or another polygon?

Alternatively, maybe the figure is not the entire rectangle but a different shape. Wait, but given all the perpendiculars and the lengths, it seems that the rectangle is the only possible configuration. Let me check if there's another way to interpret the perpendiculars.

Another angle: Let me verify each perpendicular constraint.

- Line EB and Line EA are perpendicular: Yes, since EB is horizontal and EA is vertical.

- Line BE and Line BD are perpendicular: BE is horizontal, BD is vertical, so yes.

- Line DA and Line DB are perpendicular: DA is horizontal (from D(16,9) to A(0,9)), and DB is vertical (from D(16,9) to B(16,0)), so yes, they are perpendicular.

- Line AE and Line AD are perpendicular: AE is vertical, AD is horizontal, yes.

All conditions are satisfied. So the figure is indeed the rectangle with sides 16 and 9, hence area 144. So answer D.

But wait, why isn't the answer 144? Let me check the answer choices again. The options are A. 25, B. 50, C. 72, D. 144. So D is there. But maybe I made a mistake in assuming the figure is the rectangle? Let me consider if there's another figure.

Wait, suppose instead that the figure is a combination of triangles. For instance, maybe triangle AEB and triangle BED or something? Let me recalculate.

If the rectangle is formed by EABD, then its area is 16*9=144. But maybe the problem refers to a different area. Wait, let me think again about the problem statement: "Find the area of the figure." It's possible that the figure is not the rectangle but another shape. Let me re-examine the constraints.

The problem gives several perpendicular lines, but perhaps the figure is a three-dimensional shape? No, the problem is purely geometrical with lines, so likely planar.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the figure is a square? But 16 and 9 aren't equal. Unless there's some scaling factor. But no, the given lengths are fixed. So unless there's a miscalculation here.

Wait, but let me check the coordinates again. If E is at (0,0), A at (0,9), B at (16,0), D at (16,9). Then the rectangle is from (0,0) to (16,0) to (16,9) to (0,9) back to (0,0). So that's a rectangle with base 16 and height 9. Area is 16×9=144. So answer D. But let me check if there's a possibility that the figure is a different polygon.

Wait, maybe the figure is a trapezoid or something else? For example, if there are diagonals involved? But the problem didn't mention any diagonals. All the lines given are edges of the figure. The constraints involve lines EB, EA, BD, DA, etc. So connecting those points, forming the rectangle. Hence, the area should be 144. 

However, let me check if I misread the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement:

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS:
Equals(LengthOf(Line(E, B)), 16)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(A, E)), 9)
Perpendicular(Line(E, B), Line(E, A))
Perpendicular(Line(B, E), Line(B, D))
Perpendicular(Line(D, A), Line(D, B))
Perpendicular(Line(A, E), Line(A, D))"

So, the key is that there are several perpendicular lines. The figure is defined by these lines. So perhaps the figure is the union of all these lines? But lines don't have area. Wait, but the problem says "the area of the figure", implying that the figure is a closed shape. Given the constraints, the most logical figure is the rectangle as described. 

Alternatively, maybe the figure is a square? No, because the sides are 16 and 9. Unless there's a misunderstanding in the coordinates. Let me think again. Suppose that the lines form a different shape. For example, if D is not at (16,9), but somewhere else. Wait, how did I get D at (16,9)? Because:

Since DA is horizontal (because AE is vertical and DA is perpendicular to AE), so DA must be horizontal. Therefore, D must lie on the horizontal line passing through A. Since A is at (0,9), then DA is horizontal, so D has same y-coordinate as A, which is 9. Also, BD is perpendicular to BE. Since BE is horizontal, BD must be vertical. Therefore, BD is vertical, so D lies on the vertical line passing through B (which is at (16,0)), so x-coordinate of D is 16. Therefore, combining both conditions, D is at (16, 9). So that's correct.

Therefore, the rectangle is confirmed. Thus, area is 16×9=144. Hence, answer D. But why is option D present? Let me check the answer choices again: D is 144. So that's the answer. 

But wait, maybe there's a trick here. Sometimes in these problems, the figure might be a different shape. For example, maybe overlapping areas or something else. But given the constraints, I don't see another way. All the lines are part of the rectangle. So the area is 144. Therefore, the answer should be D. 

But let me check if the problem counts something else. For example, maybe the area of triangle ABD or something. Let me compute that. Triangle ABD would have base AB and height... Wait, but AB is from (0,9) to (16,0). The length of AB can be computed via distance formula: sqrt((16)^2 + (-9)^2)=sqrt(256+81)=sqrt(337). Not sure. But if the figure was triangle ABD, area would be different. But the problem mentions several lines, including EA, EB, BD, DA. So the figure is probably the quadrilateral EABD, which is the rectangle. Hence, area 144. 

Alternatively, maybe the figure includes more points? Like point D connected to others? But according to the constraints, all the lines mentioned are accounted for. 

I think my reasoning holds. So the answer is D. 144.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the area of the figure defined by the given geometric constraints, we begin by analyzing the relationships and constructing a coordinate-based representation of the points.

### **Step 1: Assigning Coordinates Based on Constraints**

We are told:

- $ \text{Length}(EB) = 16 $
- $ \text{Length}(EA) = 9 $
- $ \angle AEB = 90^\circ $
- $ \angle BED = 90^\circ $
- $ \angle ADB = 90^\circ $
- $ \angle EAD = 90^\circ $

This suggests a series of mutually perpendicular lines intersecting at various points. To simplify, place the points using coordinate geometry:

- Place point **E** at the origin: $ E = (0, 0) $
- Since $ \angle AEB = 90^\circ $, place **A** on the y-axis: $ A = (0, 9) $
- Since $ \angle AEB = 90^\circ $, place **B** on the x-axis: $ B = (16, 0) $
- From the constraint that $ \angle ADB = 90^\circ $ and $ \angle EAD = 90^\circ $, deduce that **D** lies horizontally aligned with **A**, i.e., on the horizontal line $ y = 9 $, and vertically aligned with **B**, i.e., on the vertical line $ x = 16 $. Therefore, **D** must be at the intersection of these two lines: $ D = (16, 9) $

---

### **Step 2: Identifying the Figure**

With the coordinates:
- $ E = (0, 0) $
- $ A = (0, 9) $
- $ B = (16, 0) $
- $ D = (16, 9) $

The figure formed by connecting these points — specifically the quadrilateral $ EABD $ — is a **rectangle** because:
- All internal angles are right angles.
- Opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.

---

### **Step 3: Calculating the Area**

In a rectangle, the area is given by:
$$
\text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width}
$$

- Length of $ EB = 16 $ (horizontal side)
- Width of $ EA = 9 $ (vertical side)

Thus,
$$
\text{Area} = 16 \times 9 = 144
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

After verifying all the geometric constraints and confirming that the figure forms a rectangle with dimensions 16 and 9, the area of the figure is:

$$
\boxed{144}
$$
