C. 89
D. 101

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. First, I need to visualize the figure based on the given constraints. Since there are several angles labeled as angle 1 through 8 and some points mentioned like A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I should probably sketch a rough diagram to keep track of everything.

The problem states that m∠4 = 101°, and we need to find the measure of ∠6. Let me note down all the given equalities:

1. ∠FAD = ∠5
2. ∠AGB = ∠4 (which is 101°)
3. ∠CGA = ∠3
4. ∠EAF = ∠7
5. ∠DAE = ∠6 (this is what we need to find)
6. ∠DGC = ∠2
7. ∠BGA = ∠1
8. ∠HAF = ∠8

Also, there are some point-on-line conditions:

- Point G lies on line AD.
- Point A lies on line DH.
- Point G lies on line DH.
- Point A lies on lines EF and GH.
- Point G lies on line BC.
- Lines AE and GC are parallel.

Hmm, okay. So first, since AE is parallel to GC, maybe there's some corresponding angles or alternate interior angles involved here. Also, the points lying on certain lines might form specific shapes. For example, since A is on both EF and GH, perhaps those lines intersect at A? Similarly, G being on AD and DH suggests that G is somewhere along AD and also on DH. Wait, but if G is on AD and DH, then that would mean that G is the intersection point of AD and DH? But then, if A is on DH, which means that line DH passes through A. So line DH contains point A and point D?

Wait, the point lies on line conditions:

- Point LIES ON LINE(G, Line(A,D)) → G is on line AD. So G is somewhere along AD.

- Point LIES ON LINE(A, Line(D,H)) → A is on line DH. So line DH passes through A and D. Therefore, D and H are two points on line DH, with A lying on it. So line DH connects D and H, passing through A. That implies that A is between D and H or extended beyond?

Similarly, G is on line DH (from the third condition). So G is on line DH and also on line AD. Therefore, G is the intersection of lines AD and DH. But since line DH already includes point A, so the intersection of AD and DH is point A? Unless G is another point on line AD that's also on DH. Wait, but if G is on AD and on DH, then unless AD and DH intersect at G. However, since A is on DH, then line AD starts at A and goes through D. If G is on AD and also on DH, then G must be either A or another point where AD intersects DH. But since A is already on DH, then the only way for G to be on both AD and DH is if G is A or another intersection. But since G is a distinct point (as per the labels), likely G is different from A. Wait, but maybe there's confusion here.

Alternatively, maybe there's a typo in the constraints? Let me check again:

Original constraints:

- PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(A, D)): So G is on line AD.

- PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(D, H)): So A is on line DH.

- PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(D, H)): So G is on line DH.

Therefore, G is on both line AD and line DH. Therefore, G is the intersection point of lines AD and DH. But since A is on line DH, that means line DH passes through A and D. Therefore, lines AD and DH intersect at point D? Because line AD starts at A and goes through D. Wait, no—if line AD is defined by points A and D, then line DH is another line containing points D and H. The intersection of AD and DH is point D. So if G is on both AD and DH, then G must be point D? But that can't be because then other constraints may conflict. Alternatively, maybe the lines AD and DH intersect at G? But how?

Wait, if line DH contains point D and H, and line AD contains points A and D. Then their intersection is D. So G is on both AD and DH, so G must be D? But then if G is D, then some angles involving G might be undefined. This seems conflicting. Maybe I made a mistake here.

Let me re-examine the constraints:

PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(A, D)): G is on AD.

PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(D, H)): A is on line DH.

PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(D, H)): G is on line DH.

So, line DH contains points D and H, and also contains point A (since A is on line DH). Therefore, line DH is the same as line DAH. So line DH passes through D, A, and H. Then, since G is on AD and on DH, that means G is on line AD (so between A and D or extended) and also on line DH (which is the same line as DAH). Therefore, G is a point on line DAH (the same line as DH). So G could be anywhere along line DAH. But since G is also connected to other points like B, C, etc., as per the other constraints.

Additionally, Parallel(Line(A, E), Line(G, C)). So line AE is parallel to line GC.

Another constraint: PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(E, F)): So A is on line EF. And PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(G, H)): So A is on line GH. Therefore, point A is the intersection of lines EF, GH, and DH (since earlier, A is on DH).

This is getting complex. Let me try to outline possible relationships.

First, since AE || GC, then maybe there are corresponding angles or something. Also, considering that A is on EF and GH, and G is on AD and DH.

Perhaps I need to consider triangle or transversal lines. Let me think about the angles given.

We have angle 4 equals ∠AGB, which is 101 degrees. So ∠AGB = 101°. Let me try to imagine triangle AGB. Since G is on AD and DH, and A is on DH, then maybe triangle AGB has vertices at A, G, B. But without knowing more about the positions, it's hard.

But since AE is parallel to GC, maybe there's a parallelogram or similar triangles involved.

Alternatively, since AE || GC, then the corresponding angles formed by a transversal would be equal. For instance, if there's a transversal cutting these two lines, the corresponding angles would be equal.

But I need to relate these angles to the ones given. Let me list all the angles mentioned:

Angles 1-8 are related to various points. The key thing is that angle 4 is given as 101°, and we need angle 6, which is ∠DAE.

Let me focus on angle 4: ∠AGB = 101°. Since G is on AD and DH, and A is on DH. So line AG is part of AD? Wait, G is on AD, so AG is a segment from A to G on AD. So line AG is along AD. Therefore, ∠AGB is the angle at point G between points A and B. Since G is on AD, and line GB is connecting G to B.

But how does this help? Maybe if I can find relationships between the angles around point G or elsewhere.

Also, since AE || GC, and assuming that line AE and GC are cut by some transversal. For example, if there's a line crossing both AE and GC, creating corresponding angles. But I need to identify such lines.

Alternatively, since A is on line EF and GH, and G is on line BC (another constraint: PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(B, C))). So G is on BC. Thus, line BC passes through G. So points B, G, C are colinear.

Given that, and that line GC is parallel to AE. So line GC || AE.

Now, let me consider triangle AGB. Wait, but I don't know much about triangle AGB yet. However, since AE || GC, and if there's a transversal that creates angles with them...

For example, suppose line AB is a transversal? Not sure. Or maybe line BG?

Wait, since GC is parallel to AE, and if line BG intersects both, then the corresponding angles would be equal. Let me think.

If line BG intersects AE and GC, then ∠ABG would correspond to ∠BCG, since they are corresponding angles. But I'm not sure if that applies directly here.

Alternatively, since GC || AE, and if there's a transversal that crosses both, say line AG. Wait, line AG is part of AD. So line AG is a transversal crossing AE and GC? No, because AG is on AD, which connects A to D. If AE is parallel to GC, then maybe line AG is a transversal?

Wait, line AG is part of AD. Suppose line AG intersects AE at point A and line GC at point G. But since AE is parallel to GC, the angles formed by AG with AE and GC would be supplementary or something?

At point A, line AE and line AG meet. At point G, line GC and line AG meet. Since AE || GC, then the angles at A and G would be related.

Specifically, when two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, consecutive interior angles are supplementary. So if line AG is the transversal, then ∠EAG and ∠AGC would be consecutive interior angles, hence sum to 180°.

But ∠EAG is part of angle ∠EAF (since A is on EF), but I need to see how this relates.

Wait, ∠EAF is equal to angle 7. From the given constraints:

MeasureOf(Angle(E, A, F)) = MeasureOf(angle 7). So ∠EAF = ∠7. But ∠EAF is the angle at A between E and F. Since A is on line EF, then line EF passes through A, making ∠EAF zero? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no—wait, Angle(E, A, F) is the angle at point A between points E and F. Since A is on line EF, then points E, A, F are colinear, so ∠EAF would be a straight angle, 180 degrees. But according to the constraint, this is equal to angle 7. So that would imply that angle 7 is 180°, which is impossible. Hmm, that suggests a contradiction, which can't be right. Therefore, my understanding must be wrong.

Wait, maybe I misread the notation. In geometry, the angle notation Angle(X, Y, Z) refers to the angle at point Y between points X and Z. So Angle(E, A, F) is the angle at point A between points E and F. Now, if A lies on line EF, then points E, A, F are colinear, so the angle between EA and FA is a straight angle (180 degrees). But according to the constraint, this is equal to angle 7. Which would imply angle 7 is 180°, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be an error in my interpretation.

Wait, maybe the line EF is not the same as the line through E and F? Wait, no—the notation says PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(E, F)), meaning that A is on line EF. So points E, F are endpoints of a line, and A is somewhere on that line. Hence, Angle(E, A, F) would be a straight angle. Therefore, the problem statement must have a typo or I'm misunderstanding something. Alternatively, maybe the angle isn't between E-A-F but something else. Wait, maybe the angle is not at A? No, the notation is Angle(E, A, F), which is angle at A. So this leads to a contradiction unless angle 7 is 180°, which isn't possible. Therefore, my previous assumption must be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the line EF is not a straight line passing through A? But the constraint says PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(E, F)), which means that A is on line EF. Therefore, line EF must pass through A. So unless E and F are the same point, which they aren't. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the setup.

Alternatively, maybe the points are arranged differently. Perhaps E and F are not on a straight line with A, but A is on line EF in some other way. Wait, no—if A is on line EF, then E, A, F are colinear. So ∠EAF is a straight angle. Therefore, this suggests that angle 7 is 180°, which contradicts the possibility of having a valid figure. Therefore, there must be an error in my interpretation of the constraints.

Wait, going back to the original problem statement. Let me check again the constraints:

PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(E, F)): So A is on line EF.

PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(G, H)): So A is on line GH.

So A is the intersection of lines EF and GH. Additionally, A is on line DH (from the second constraint: PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(D, H))).

Therefore, point A is where lines EF, GH, and DH meet. So three lines intersecting at A: EF, GH, and DH.

Then, line AE is parallel to line GC. So line AE and line GC are parallel.

But earlier, we saw that ∠EAF is supposed to be angle 7, which would be a straight angle. This suggests that perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the angle notation. Alternatively, maybe the angle is not at point A? But the notation specifies Angle(E, A, F), which should be at A. 

Wait, unless there's a typo and it's meant to be Angle(E, A, F) but actually refers to another configuration. Alternatively, maybe the angle is not between EA and FA, but between other segments? For example, if there's another point involved? No, the notation is clear: Angle(E, A, F) is the angle at A between E and F.

This seems like a contradiction, implying that my current understanding of the figure is flawed. Let me try to approach this differently, focusing on the other constraints instead.

Since AE || GC, and A is on EF and GH, and G is on BC. Let me think about the implications of AE || GC.

Suppose line AE is parallel to line GC. Then, any transversal cutting these lines will create equal corresponding angles. For example, if there's a line that intersects both AE and GC, the corresponding angles would be equal.

Since point A is on AE, and line GC passes through point G. So if we take line AG as a transversal, then it intersects AE at A and GC at G. Since AE || GC, the corresponding angles would be ∠EAG (at A) and ∠AGC (at G). These angles should be equal.

So ∠EAG = ∠AGC.

Now, ∠EAG is part of ∠EAF, which was previously thought to be a straight angle. But if ∠EAF is a straight angle, then ∠EAG is part of it. Wait, but if A is on line EF, then line AE is part of line EF, and line AF is the same line. So ∠EAF is indeed a straight angle. But if ∠EAG is part of it, then ∠EAG + ∠GAF = 180°, but since G is on AD, and A is on EF, I need to see where G is located.

Alternatively, maybe ∠EAG is not part of ∠EAF. Wait, if G is on AD, and A is on EF, then line AG is a separate line from EF. So ∠EAG is the angle between EA and GA, while ∠EAF is the angle between EA and FA. Since FA is part of line EF, and GA is another line.

So, if AE || GC, then ∠EAG = ∠AGC (corresponding angles). Let's denote ∠EAG as x, then ∠AGC is also x.

Now, looking at triangle AGC. We know that ∠AGC = x. What else do we know about this triangle?

Point G is on line AD and DH. Line GC is parallel to AE. Also, G is on line BC (from the constraint: PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(B, C))). So line GC is part of line BC? Or G is on line BC, so GC is a segment from G to C.

Wait, if G is on line BC, then GC is part of line BC. So line BC passes through G, and line GC is just the segment from G to C. Since AE || GC, which is part of line BC. So line AE is parallel to line BC.

Wait, if line AE is parallel to line BC, then that gives us some information about the angles involving these lines.

Moreover, since line AE is parallel to line BC, and if there's a transversal cutting these lines, we can use the properties of parallel lines.

Now, let's recall that ∠AGB = 101°, which is angle 4. So ∠AGB is at point G between points A and B. Since G is on line BC, then line GB is part of line BC. So ∠AGB is the angle at G between A and B. Since G is on BC, line GB is extending from G towards B, and line GA is from G towards A.

So, in triangle AGB, we have angle at G being 101°, and since line AE || line BC (because AE || GC, which is part of BC), then maybe there are some relationships here.

Let me try to draw this mentally. Line AE is parallel to line BC. So if I consider line AE and line BC as two parallel lines. Point A is on line AE, and point G is on line BC. Line AG connects A to G, forming a transversal. Since AE || BC, then the corresponding angles created by AG would be equal. For example, ∠EAG corresponds to ∠AGB, because AG is the transversal.

Wait, if line AE || line BC, and AG is a transversal, then ∠EAG (at A) is equal to ∠AGB (at G). Because they are corresponding angles. So ∠EAG = ∠AGB = 101°. 

Earlier, we had that ∠EAG = ∠AGC (from the parallel lines AE || GC). Wait, but if AE || BC, then GC is part of BC, so ∠AGC would be equal to ∠EAG. But ∠AGC is part of triangle AGC. Let me clarify:

If line AE || line BC, then the corresponding angles would be:

- ∠EAG (on line AE) corresponds to ∠AGB (on line BC), which is 101°, as established.

But also, since line AE || line BC, and line AG is a transversal, then ∠EAG = ∠AGB = 101°, as above.

So ∠EAG = 101°, which is part of ∠EAF. Earlier, I thought ∠EAF was a straight angle, but if ∠EAG is 101°, then ∠GAF would be ∠EAF - ∠EAG = 180° - 101° = 79°. But ∠EAF is equal to angle 7. So angle 7 is 79°, which makes sense. So that resolves that issue.

So angle 7 is 79°, which is helpful. Now, moving on.

We need to find angle 6, which is ∠DAE. Let's think about that.

∠DAE is the angle at point A between points D and E. Since A is on line DH and line EF. Let me consider the location of D and E relative to A.

From the point-on-line constraints:

- Point G is on AD and DH. So line AD passes through G.

- Point A is on DH, so line DH passes through A and D.

- Also, line AE is parallel to line BC.

Let me consider the position of D. Since G is on AD, and A is on DH, and line DH contains D and H. So line AD extends from A through D to H? Or D is between A and H? It depends on the exact configuration, but since G is on AD and DH, and A is on DH, then line DH contains points D, A, and H. So the order might be D---A---H, with G somewhere on AD. But since G is also on DH, which is the same line as DAH, G is somewhere along DAH. So G is between D and A, or A and H, depending on where it is.

Assuming standard configuration, perhaps G is between D and A. But not sure. Let's proceed.

Now, ∠DAE is the angle at A between D and E. Since D is on line DH, which passes through A, and E is on line EF, which also passes through A. So ∠DAE is formed by lines AD and AE at point A.

Since line AD is part of line DH, and line AE is parallel to line BC, as established before.

To find ∠DAE, we might need to relate it to other angles using the properties of parallel lines or triangle sums.

Let me consider triangle ADE, but I need more information. Alternatively, look at the angles around point A.

At point A, we have several lines: DH, EF, and GH. Since A is on all three lines. Let me think about the angles formed at A.

From earlier, we found that ∠EAG = 101°, which is part of ∠EAF (a straight angle), leading to ∠GAF = 79°, which is angle 7.

Now, ∠DAE is the angle between DA and EA. Let me consider the relationship between DA and AE.

Since line AE is parallel to line BC, and if we can find some relation between DA and BC, that might help. But I don't have direct info on that yet.

Alternatively, since line AE || BC, and if there's a transversal that cuts these lines, creating angles that can be related.

Let me think about line AD. Since G is on AD and on BC (from the constraint: PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(B, C))), then line AD passes through G, which is on BC. So line AD intersects line BC at point G.

Therefore, AD and BC intersect at G. Since AE || BC, then line AD acts as a transversal cutting the parallel lines AE and BC. Wait, no: AE is parallel to BC, and line AD intersects BC at G, so line AD is a transversal that meets BC at G and AE at A.

So applying the property of parallel lines: when a transversal intersects two parallel lines, the consecutive interior angles are supplementary. 

In this case, the transversal is AD, intersecting AE at A and BC at G. So the consecutive interior angles would be ∠EAG (at A) and ∠AGB (at G). These two angles are supplementary, meaning ∠EAG + ∠AGB = 180°. 

Wait, earlier we said that ∠EAG = ∠AGB = 101°, which would make their sum 202°, which is not supplementary. This contradicts, indicating a mistake.

Wait, but earlier I thought that ∠EAG = ∠AGB due to corresponding angles. But if AE || BC, then the corresponding angles would be ∠EAG (at A) and ∠AGB (at G)? Wait, no. Corresponding angles are on the same side of the transversal. If AE || BC and AD is the transversal, then ∠EAG (between AE and AD) corresponds to ∠AGB (between BC and AD). Wait, but ∠AGB is at G, between B and C. Let me clarify.

When a transversal cuts two parallel lines, corresponding angles are equal. Here, AE || BC, and AD is the transversal. The corresponding angles would be:

- At A: angle between AE and AD (∠EAG)

- At G: angle between BC and AD (∠AGB)

But since AE || BC, these corresponding angles should be equal. So ∠EAG = ∠AGB. But earlier, we were told that ∠AGB = 101°, so ∠EAG should also be 101°. But then, if ∠EAG + ∠AGB = 101° + 101° = 202°, which would contradict the idea that they are supplementary. Wait, why did I think they were supplementary? That's only true for consecutive interior angles, not corresponding angles. So my mistake was assuming they were supplementary; they're actually equal.

So, ∠EAG = ∠AGB = 101°. This makes sense. So ∠EAG = 101°, which is part of ∠EAF (straight angle), so ∠GAF = 180° - 101° = 79°, which is angle 7, as before.

Now, returning to ∠DAE. This is the angle between DA and EA at point A. Since DA is part of line AD, and EA is part of line AE. So ∠DAE is the angle between AD and AE at A.

We can think of this angle as ∠DAE = ∠DAG + ∠GAE. Wait, if G is on AD, then line AG is part of AD. So ∠DAE would be ∠DAE = ∠DAG + ∠GAE. But since G is on AD, then ∠DAG is zero? Wait, no. If G is on AD, then line AG is part of AD. So point G is along AD, so from A to D, passing through G. So if we consider ∠DAE, it's the angle between AD (going from A to D) and AE. So ∠DAE is simply the angle between AD and AE at point A.

Since line AE is parallel to line BC, and line AD intersects BC at G, we might use some properties here.

Let me consider triangle AGB, where we know ∠AGB = 101°, and ∠EAG = 101°. Wait, but in triangle AGB, the angles are:

- At A: ∠EAG = 101°

- At G: ∠AGB = 101°

Wait, that would mean that the third angle at B would be 180° - 101° - 101° = -22°, which is impossible. Clearly, there's a mistake here.

Ah! Wait, ∠EAG is not necessarily inside triangle AGB. Let me clarify:

∠EAG is the angle between EA and AG. Since AG is part of AD, then ∠EAG is the angle between EA and AD at point A. So ∠EAG is adjacent to ∠DAE. Specifically, ∠DAE = ∠EAG + something? No, if G is on AD, then AG is part of AD. So if you have line AE and line AD meeting at A, then ∠DAE is the angle between AE and AD. So ∠DAE = ∠EAG. Wait, because AG is part of AD, so the angle between AE and AG is the same as the angle between AE and AD. So ∠DAE = ∠EAG = 101°. But wait, earlier we said that ∠EAG = 101°, so ∠DAE = 101°, which would mean that angle 6 is 101°, which is option D. But the answer choices include D as 101, but I need to verify.

However, this seems contradictory because earlier I thought ∠EAG was part of a straight angle. Let me double-check:

If ∠DAE is the angle between DA and EA, and since G is on DA, then ∠DAE is the same as ∠EAG. Because AG is along DA. So yes, ∠DAE = ∠EAG = 101°, which would mean ∠6 = 101°, so answer D. But let me confirm with other constraints.

But wait, earlier I considered that ∠EAF is a straight angle, which would mean that ∠EAG + ∠GAF = 180°. If ∠EAG is 101°, then ∠GAF = 79°, which is angle 7. So that makes sense. So angle 7 is 79°, and angle 6 is 101°. But the question asks for angle 6, which is ∠DAE = 101°, so answer D.

But wait, the problem states that m∠4 = 101°, which is ∠AGB = 101°, and we've deduced that ∠DAE = 101°, so angle 6 would be 101°, which is option D. But let me check if there's anything wrong here.

Wait, but if ∠DAE = 101°, and angle 4 is also 101°, that seems possible. But let me ensure there's no other relations affecting this.

Alternatively, maybe there's a calculation error. Let me go back.

Since line AE is parallel to line BC, and line AD intersects them at A and G respectively. As per the properties of parallel lines, the corresponding angles are equal. So ∠EAG (at A) corresponds to ∠AGB (at G), so they are equal. Hence, ∠EAG = ∠AGB = 101°, which is given as angle 4. Therefore, ∠EAG = 101°, and since ∠DAE is the same as ∠EAG (because AG is on DA), then ∠DAE = 101°, which is angle 6. So the answer is D.

But the problem provides answer choices including D as 101. But sometimes problems may have trick elements. Let me check again for contradictions.

Wait, if ∠DAE = 101°, and angle 4 is also 101°, then that's acceptable. There's no rule against two angles having the same measure unless specified otherwise. So this seems plausible.

However, let me consider another approach. Suppose we consider triangle ADE. If we can find other angles in this triangle.

But we need more information. Alternatively, since AE || BC, and if there's a transversal involving DE or something.

Alternatively, let's think about the fact that line AE || GC, and line GC is part of line BC. So AE || BC. So the distance between AE and BC is constant, but not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, since G is on BC, and line AG intersects BC at G. So with AE || BC, and AG being a transversal, we have ∠EAG = ∠AGB = 101°, as discussed.

Thus, ∠DAE = 101°, which is angle 6. Hence, the answer is D.

But let me cross-verify with the other constraints. For example, what about angle 5, which is equal to ∠FAD. ∠FAD is the angle at A between F and D. Since A is on line EF and DH. So line AF is part of EF, and AD is part of DH. So ∠FAD is the angle between AF and AD at A. Which would be supplementary to ∠DAE if F, A, E are collinear. Wait, since A is on line EF, then AF is along EF. So ∠FAD is the angle between AF (along EF) and AD. So ∠FAD + ∠DAE = 180°, since they form a linear pair along EF and DH. Wait, but unless lines EF and DH are straight lines, which they are. So if A is on both EF and DH, then ∠FAD and ∠DAE are adjacent angles forming a straight line, so they add up to 180°. 

So ∠FAD + ∠DAE = 180°. Given that ∠FAD = angle 5, and ∠DAE = angle 6. So angle 5 + angle 6 = 180°. But we don't know angle 5, so this might not help directly.

But if angle 6 is 101°, then angle 5 would be 79°. Is there any information about angle 5? The problem doesn't give us its value, so this is consistent. 

Alternatively, if angle 6 is 101°, then angle 5 is 79°, which might relate to other angles, but without more data, it's hard to say. 

Given all this, I think the most logical conclusion is that ∠DAE = 101°, making angle 6 equal to 101°, so answer D. But let me check once more for errors.

Another way: since ∠DAE is equal to ∠EAG, which is equal to ∠AGB = 101°, so angle 6 = 101°, answer D. Yes, this seems consistent.

But wait, the answer options include D as 101, which matches our deduction. So the final answer is D.
