MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, and C. The problem says that the lengths of lines BC and AC are both equal to x. Also, the length of AB is 20 units. Additionally, the lines CB and CA are perpendicular. Hmm, okay, so I need to find x. Let me visualize this first.

Since CB and CA are perpendicular, that means point C forms a right angle between points A and B. Wait, no—wait, line CB and line CA are perpendicular. So, point C is connected to both A and B, and those two lines (CA and CB) form a right angle at point C. So triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at point C. Because the legs are CA and CB, which are both length x, and the hypotenuse would be AB, which is given as 20.

Wait, but hold on—if it's a right-angled triangle at C, then by Pythagoras' theorem, the sum of squares of the legs equals the square of the hypotenuse. So, if CA and CB are the legs, each of length x, then:

AB² = AC² + BC²

But since AC and BC are both x, then:

AB² = x² + x² = 2x²

So AB² = 2x² → AB = x√2

But we know AB is 20. Therefore,

20 = x√2 → solving for x gives x = 20 / √2

Rationalizing the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by √2:

x = (20√2)/2 = 10√2

Calculating the numerical value, √2 ≈ 1.4142, so:

10 * 1.4142 ≈ 14.142

Rounded to the nearest tenth, that's approximately 14.1. Looking at the answer choices, option C is 14.1. So the answer should be C.

Wait, let me check again. Did I interpret the problem correctly? Let me re-read the constraints.

The problem states that Lines CB and CA are perpendicular. So, yes, the right angle is at point C. So triangle ABC is right-angled at C, making AB the hypotenuse. Then the calculation holds. So yes, x is 10√2 ≈14.1. So answer C. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach it? For example, coordinates. Let me try assigning coordinates to verify.

Let’s place point C at the origin (0,0). Since CA and CB are perpendicular, let’s set point A along the x-axis and point B along the y-axis. So point A is (a, 0) and point B is (0, b). Then the distance from C to A is sqrt((a)^2 + 0^2) = |a| = x. Similarly, distance from C to B is sqrt(0^2 + b^2) = |b| = x. So a = x and b = x. Then point A is (x, 0) and point B is (0, x). Then the distance between A and B is sqrt[(x - 0)^2 + (0 - x)^2] = sqrt(x² + x²) = sqrt(2x²) = x√2. Which equals 20. So same equation as before. Hence x = 20 / √2 ≈14.14. Rounded to the nearest tenth is 14.1. So answer C. 

Therefore, the correct answer is C. 14.1.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration described in the problem:

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Geometry**

We are given three key pieces of information:

1. $ \text{Length}(BC) = x $
2. $ \text{Length}(AC) = x $
3. $ \text{Length}(AB) = 20 $
4. $ \angle ACB = 90^\circ $ (since lines $ CB $ and $ CA $ are perpendicular)

This setup implies that triangle $ ABC $ is a **right triangle** with the right angle at vertex $ C $. Thus, sides $ AC $ and $ CB $ are the **legs**, and side $ AB $ is the **hypotenuse**.

---

### **Step 2: Applying the Pythagorean Theorem**

In a right triangle, the relationship between the legs and the hypotenuse is given by:

$$
\text{(Hypotenuse)}^2 = (\text{Leg}_1)^2 + (\text{Leg}_2)^2
$$

Here:

- $ AC = x $
- $ CB = x $
- $ AB = 20 $

Substituting into the formula:

$$
20^2 = x^2 + x^2 = 2x^2
$$

$$
400 = 2x^2
$$

$$
x^2 = 200
$$

$$
x = \sqrt{200} = \sqrt{100 \cdot 2} = 10\sqrt{2}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Approximating the Value**

We approximate $ \sqrt{2} \approx 1.4142 $:

$$
x = 10 \times 1.4142 = 14.142
$$

Rounding to the nearest tenth:

$$
x \approx 14.1
$$

---

### **Step 4: Matching with Given Choices**

The possible answers are:

- A. 1.4  
- B. 7.1  
- C. 14.1  
- D. 15.6  

Our computed value is $ 14.1 $, which matches **Option C**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\text{C}}
$$
