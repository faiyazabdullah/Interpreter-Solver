MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have triangle ABC with some given lengths and a right angle. Let me start by writing down what I know.

First, the problem says that the length of line BC is 20 units, CA is 25 units, and BA is 15 units. Also, it mentions that lines BC and BA are perpendicular. Wait, so that means angle at point B is a right angle? Because if two lines meet at a point and are perpendicular, then the angle between them is 90 degrees. So, angle B is 90 degrees. Therefore, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at B.

But wait, the question asks for the cosine of angle A. Hmm. Let me recall that in a right-angled triangle, the cosine of an angle is adjacent over hypotenuse. But first, I need to make sure which angle we're talking about here.

Angle A is at vertex A. In triangle ABC, angle A is opposite side BC and adjacent to sides AB and AC. Wait, maybe I should draw a diagram mentally. Let me label the points. Let's say point B is the right angle. Then, points A, B, and C form a triangle with right angle at B. So, BA and BC are the legs, and AC is the hypotenuse?

Wait, but hold on. The given lengths are BA = 15, BC = 20, and CA = 25. Let me check if these satisfy the Pythagorean theorem. If BA and BC are the legs, then their squares should add up to the square of the hypotenuse. Let me calculate:

BA² + BC² = 15² + 20² = 225 + 400 = 625. And CA² is 25² = 625. Oh, yes! That checks out. So, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at B, with legs BA=15, BC=20, and hypotenuse AC=25.

Now, the question is asking for cos A. So angle A is at vertex A. Let me think about how to find cos A. In triangle ABC, angle A is one of the acute angles. To find its cosine, I can use the definition of cosine in a right-angled triangle. However, since the right angle is at B, angle A is adjacent to side AB and opposite to side BC.

Wait, let me recall that in a right-angled triangle, cosine of an angle is equal to the adjacent side divided by the hypotenuse. For angle A, the adjacent side would be AB (since angle A is at A, the sides forming angle A are AB and AC). Wait, no. Let me clarify.

In triangle ABC, angle A is formed by sides AB and AC. Wait, actually, angle A is between sides AB and AC? No, in a triangle, each angle is between two sides. So angle A is between sides AB and AC? Wait, no. Let me get this straight.

The vertices are A, B, C. So, angle at A is between sides AB and AC. Wait, but in a triangle, each angle is between two sides connected to that vertex. So, angle A is between AB and AC. Wait, but AB connects to A and B, and AC connects to A and C. So yes, angle A is between AB and AC. But since the triangle is right-angled at B, the sides AB and BC are perpendicular.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinates will help. Let me assign coordinates to the points to visualize better. Let's place point B at the origin (0,0) because it's the right angle. Since BA is one leg and BC is another. Let me assume BA is along the x-axis and BC is along the y-axis. So, point B is at (0,0). Point A is somewhere along the x-axis. Since BA is 15 units long, then point A would be at (15, 0). Point C is along the y-axis, since BC is 20 units. So, point C would be at (0, 20).

Then, the coordinates would be:
- B: (0, 0)
- A: (15, 0)
- C: (0, 20)

Now, let's verify the distance between A and C. The distance between (15,0) and (0,20) should be sqrt[(15-0)^2 + (0 - 20)^2] = sqrt[225 + 400] = sqrt[625] = 25, which matches the given length of AC. Perfect.

So, with coordinates established, we can find angle A. Angle A is at point A (15,0). Let me think about how to compute cos A. There are a couple of ways. One way is to use vectors or coordinate geometry.

Alternatively, since we have a right-angled triangle, perhaps we can use trigonometric ratios. Let me consider triangle ABC. In triangle ABC, angle A is adjacent to side AB and opposite to side BC. Wait, but in terms of the standard definitions, for angle A, the adjacent side would be AB, and the hypotenuse is AC. Wait, but in the right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is AC, which is opposite the right angle at B. So, angle A is one of the non-right angles. 

Therefore, cos(angle A) equals adjacent / hypotenuse. Which sides are adjacent and opposite relative to angle A? At angle A, the sides are AB (adjacent) and AC (hypotenuse). Wait, no. Wait, adjacent to angle A is AB and AC? Or adjacent is AB and the other side?

Let me recall: In a right-angled triangle, for an acute angle, the cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse. The adjacent side is the one that forms the angle along with the hypotenuse. So, angle A is formed by AB and AC. Wait, AB is one leg, and AC is the hypotenuse. So, the adjacent side to angle A is AB, and the hypotenuse is AC. Therefore, cos(A) = AB / AC.

Wait, AB is 15, AC is 25. So cos(A) = 15/25 = 0.6. Which is 0.60. Looking at the answer choices, option A is 0.60. So that seems straightforward. But let me confirm once again to avoid mistakes.

Alternatively, maybe I can use vectors. Let me take vectors for angle A. The angle at A is between vectors AB and AC. Wait, no. Wait, angle at A is between vectors AB and AC? Wait, no. Wait, at point A, the two sides forming the angle are AB and AC. Wait, AB goes from A to B, and AC goes from A to C. So, vectors AB and AC emanate from A. Wait, but to compute the angle between them, we can use the dot product formula. Let me do that.

Vector AB is from A to B: coordinates of B minus coordinates of A. So, vector AB is (0 - 15, 0 - 0) = (-15, 0). Vector AC is from A to C: coordinates of C minus coordinates of A: (0 - 15, 20 - 0) = (-15, 20). Now, the angle between vectors AB and AC is angle A. The cosine of angle A is equal to the dot product of AB and AC divided by the product of their magnitudes.

Calculating the dot product: (-15)(-15) + (0)(20) = 225 + 0 = 225.

Magnitude of AB: sqrt((-15)^2 + 0^2) = sqrt(225) = 15.

Magnitude of AC: sqrt((-15)^2 + 20^2) = sqrt(225 + 400) = sqrt(625) = 25.

Thus, cos(theta) = 225/(15*25) = 225/375 = 0.6. Same result as before. So cos A is 0.60. So the answer is A.

But wait, let me check if there's another approach just to be thorough. Maybe using the Law of Cosines? Although since it's a right-angled triangle, the Law of Cosines would reduce to the Pythagorean theorem. But let me try it anyway.

Law of Cosines states that c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(theta). Here, angle A is theta. Let's denote sides as follows: in triangle ABC, angle A is opposite side BC, which has length 20. The sides adjacent to angle A are AB (length 15) and AC (length 25). Wait, no, the Law of Cosines applies to any triangle. Let me recall: for angle A, the Law of Cosines would state that BC² = AB² + AC² - 2 * AB * AC * cos(angle A). Wait, but BC is opposite angle A. Wait, in standard notation, side a is opposite angle A, side b opposite angle B, etc. But maybe I'm mixing up here.

Alternatively, let me write it properly. For angle A, the sides are: the side opposite angle A is BC (which is 20), and the other two sides are AB (15) and AC (25). Wait, no, AC is the hypotenuse. Wait, in triangle ABC, with right angle at B, AC is the hypotenuse. So, applying Law of Cosines to angle A:

BC² = AB² + AC² - 2 * AB * AC * cos(angle A)

Wait, but BC is 20, AB is 15, AC is 25. Plugging in:

20² = 15² + 25² - 2 * 15 * 25 * cos(angle A)

Compute left side: 400

Right side: 225 + 625 - 750 cos(angle A) = 850 - 750 cos(angle A)

Set equal: 400 = 850 - 750 cos(angle A)

Subtract 850: 400 - 850 = -750 cos(angle A)

-450 = -750 cos(angle A)

Divide both sides by -750:

(-450)/(-750) = cos(angle A)

Which simplifies to 450/750 = 0.6. So same result. Thus, cos A is 0.6. Therefore, the answer is A. 

All methods lead to the same conclusion. Therefore, the correct answer is A, which is 0.60. 

Looking back at the answer choices, A is 0.60, so that's the correct choice. I don't see any errors in my reasoning. All approaches—using the definition of cosine in a right-angled triangle, vector dot product, and Law of Cosines—give the same result. So I feel confident that the answer is A.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $\cos A$ in triangle $ABC$, we begin by analyzing the given information:

- $AB = 15$
- $BC = 20$
- $AC = 25$
- $\angle B = 90^\circ$ (since lines $BC$ and $BA$ are perpendicular)

This confirms that triangle $ABC$ is a **right triangle** with the right angle at vertex $B$. Thus, the triangle satisfies the **Pythagorean Theorem**:

$$
AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2 \\
15^2 + 20^2 = 225 + 400 = 625 = 25^2
$$

This verifies the triangle’s validity.

### Step 1: Understanding $\cos A$

We are asked to find $\cos A$, where $A$ is the angle at vertex $A$. In a right triangle, the **cosine of an angle** is defined as the ratio of the **adjacent side** to the **hypotenuse**, i.e.,

$$
\cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
$$

For angle $A$, the adjacent side is $AB$ (the side forming angle $A$ and connecting to the right angle at $B$), and the hypotenuse is $AC$. Therefore,

$$
\cos A = \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{15}{25}
$$

---

### Step 2: Simplifying the Ratio

$$
\cos A = \frac{15}{25} = 0.6
$$

Rounded to the nearest hundredth, this remains **0.60**.

### Final Verification Using Vectors

Using vectors helps further confirm the result. Place the triangle on the coordinate plane with:
- $B = (0, 0)$,
- $A = (15, 0)$,
- $C = (0, 20)$.

Vectors:
- $\vec{AB} = \langle -15, 0 \rangle$,
- $\vec{AC} = \langle -15, 20 \rangle$

Dot product:
$$
\vec{AB} \cdot \vec{AC} = (-15)(-15) + (0)(20) = 225
$$

Magnitudes:
$$
|\vec{AB}| = \sqrt{(-15)^2 + 0^2} = 15,\quad |\vec{AC}| = \sqrt{(-15)^2 + 20^2} = 25
$$

$$
\cos A = \frac{\vec{AB} \cdot \vec{AC}}{|\vec{AB}| \cdot |\vec{AC}|} = \frac{225}{15 \times 25} = 0.6
$$

This confirms our earlier calculation.

---

### Conclusion

All methods consistently yield:

$$
\cos A = 0.60
$$

Thus, the correct answer is:

$$
\boxed{\text{A}}
$$
