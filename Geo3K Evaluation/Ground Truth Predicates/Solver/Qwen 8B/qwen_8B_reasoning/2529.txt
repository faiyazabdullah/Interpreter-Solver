====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have points A, B, and C. The given information includes some lengths and angles. Let me jot down the key points:

First, the length of line AC is 20 units. Then, the length of AB is x, which we need to find. The angle at point A between lines AC and AB is 60 degrees. Also, the length of BC is y. Additionally, there's a perpendicularity condition: line BA is perpendicular to line BC. Wait, that might be important.

Let me visualize this. Since BA is perpendicular to BC, that means the angle at point B between BA and BC is 90 degrees. Hmm. But the angle at A (between AC and AB) is 60 degrees. Maybe I can draw triangle ABC here. Let me sketch it mentally.

So, points A, B, C. Let me note the given info again. AC = 20. AB = x, BC = y. Angle at A (∠CAB) is 60 degrees. And BA ⊥ BC, so ∠ABC is 90 degrees? Wait, no. If BA is perpendicular to BC, then the angle at B between BA and BC is 90 degrees. So, ∠ABC is 90 degrees. Therefore, triangle ABC has a right angle at B, and another angle at A of 60 degrees. Wait, but in a triangle, the sum of angles is 180 degrees. So if angle at A is 60°, angle at B is 90°, then angle at C would be 30°, since 60 + 90 + 30 = 180. That seems possible.

But wait, hold on. Let me confirm. In triangle ABC, angle at B is 90°, angle at A is 60°, so angle at C would be 30°. Now, using trigonometric ratios, maybe we can relate the sides.

In a right-angled triangle, the sides are related by sine and cosine. Since angle at A is 60°, hypotenuse would be opposite the right angle. Wait, but which side is the hypotenuse?

Wait, triangle ABC has a right angle at B. Therefore, the hypotenuse is AC. Because in a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. So AC is the hypotenuse. Given that AC is 20 units. Then, angle at A is 60°, so that would mean that side BC is opposite angle A, and side AB is adjacent to angle A.

Wait, let me recall SOHCAHTOA. For angle A (which is 60°), the opposite side is BC, the adjacent side is AB, and the hypotenuse is AC.

Therefore, sin(60°) = opposite / hypotenuse = BC / AC → BC = AC * sin(60°). Similarly, cos(60°) = adjacent / hypotenuse = AB / AC → AB = AC * cos(60°).

Since AC is 20, then AB = 20 * cos(60°). Cos(60°) is 0.5, so AB = 20 * 0.5 = 10. Wait, but that would make AB equal to 10. However, looking at the answer choices, none of them is 10. The options are multiples of sqrt(3). So perhaps my reasoning is wrong?

Wait, maybe I got the sides mixed up. Let me check again. If the right angle is at B, then sides AB and BC are the legs, and AC is the hypotenuse. So angle at A is 60°, meaning that the side opposite to angle A is BC. Therefore, BC = AC * sin(angle A). Which would be BC = 20 * sin(60°) = 20*(√3/2) = 10√3. Then AB would be adjacent to angle A, so AB = AC * cos(angle A) = 20 * cos(60°) = 20*(1/2)=10. So AB is 10. But 10 isn't among the answer choices. Wait, but the answer choices are A. 4√3 ≈6.928, B. 6√3≈10.392, C. 8√3≈13.856, D. 10√3≈17.32. Hmm. But according to this, AB should be 10, which is not listed. But maybe I made a mistake in identifying the angle?

Alternatively, perhaps the angle given is not angle A but something else. Let me recheck the problem statement.

The measure of angle(A, C, B) is 60 degrees. Wait, angle notation: angle(A, C, B) refers to the angle at point C between points A and B. Wait, no. Wait, in standard notation, angle(A, C, B) is the angle at point C formed by points A, C, B. So vertex at C, with segments CA and CB. So that would be angle at C. Wait, that changes things. Oh! I think I misread the angle earlier.

Original problem says: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A, C, B)), 60). So the angle is at point C. So angle ACB is 60 degrees. So that's different from what I thought before. Earlier, I assumed the angle was at A, but actually, it's at point C. That's crucial. Let me start over with that correction.

So, angle at C is 60 degrees. Also, BA is perpendicular to BC. So BA ⊥ BC implies that angle at B is 90 degrees. So triangle ABC has a right angle at B, angle at C is 60 degrees, so angle at A would be 180 - 90 - 60 = 30 degrees. So angles are: at B: 90°, at C: 60°, at A: 30°. 

Now, with these angles, let's consider the sides. Again, hypotenuse is AC because it's opposite the right angle at B. Wait, no. Wait, in triangle ABC, the right angle is at B, so hypotenuse is AC. So AC is the hypotenuse. Then, sides AB and BC are the legs.

Given angle at C is 60°, which is opposite to AB. Because angle at C is opposite AB. Wait, angle at C is between BC and AC. Let me think. In triangle ABC, angle at C is between BC and AC. So the side opposite angle C is AB. So AB is opposite angle C (which is 60°). So using sine law:

sin(angle C)/AB = sin(angle B)/AC. Wait, angle B is 90°, so sin(90°)=1. So:

sin(60°)/AB = 1 / AC → AB = AC * sin(60°)

Wait, AC is 20. So AB = 20 * sin(60°) = 20*(√3/2) = 10√3. Which is option D. But wait, let me verify with another approach.

Alternatively, since angle at B is 90°, angle at C is 60°, so angle at A is 30°. In such a triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. Wait, for a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides opposite 30°, 60°, 90° are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2.

But in our case, the angles are: angle at A: 30°, angle at B: 90°, angle at C: 60°. Therefore, side opposite 30° is BC, side opposite 60° is AB, and hypotenuse AC is opposite 90°.

Wait, so:

Side opposite 30° (angle A): BC = ?

Side opposite 60° (angle C): AB = ?

Hypotenuse AC = 20.

In a standard 30-60-90 triangle, hypotenuse is twice the shorter leg. Here, the shorter leg is opposite 30°, which is BC. So BC = AC / 2 = 20 / 2 = 10. Then the longer leg (opposite 60°) is AB = BC * √3 = 10√3. Therefore, AB = 10√3, which matches the previous calculation. So AB is 10√3, which is option D.

Wait, but why did I initially get confused? Because I misread the angle as being at A instead of C. Once corrected, everything makes sense. So the answer should be D. 10√3.

But let me cross-check with coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to points to verify.

Let’s place point B at the origin (0,0). Since BA is perpendicular to BC, and assuming BA is along the y-axis and BC is along the x-axis. So:

Point B is at (0,0).

Since BA is perpendicular to BC, suppose BA is vertical and BC is horizontal.

Then, point A is somewhere along the y-axis. Let’s say point A is at (0, k). Point C is along the x-axis, so point C is at (m, 0).

Then, AC is the distance between (0,k) and (m,0), which is sqrt(m² + k²) = 20. So m² + k² = 400.

Angle at C is 60 degrees. Let's compute angle at C. To find angle at C, which is between points A-C-B. So vectors from C to A and from C to B.

Vector CA is A - C = (0 - m, k - 0) = (-m, k)

Vector CB is B - C = (0 - m, 0 - 0) = (-m, 0)

The angle between vectors CA and CB is 60 degrees. So using the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (CA · CB) / (|CA| |CB|)

Compute CA · CB = (-m)(-m) + (k)(0) = m² + 0 = m²

|CA| = sqrt(m² + k²) = 20

|CB| = sqrt((-m)^2 + 0^2) = |m|

Thus,

cos(theta) = m² / (20 * |m| ) = |m| / 20

We know theta is 60°, so cos(theta) = 0.5

Therefore:

|m| / 20 = 0.5 ⇒ |m| = 10 ⇒ m = ±10

Assuming m positive, m=10. Then, since m² + k² = 400, 10² + k² = 400 ⇒ 100 + k² = 400 ⇒ k² = 300 ⇒ k = sqrt(300) = 10√3.

So point A is at (0, 10√3), point B at (0,0), point C at (10, 0). Then AB is the distance from (0,0) to (0, 10√3), which is 10√3. Hence, x = AB = 10√3. So that confirms the answer is D.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration described in the problem and applying fundamental principles of trigonometry and triangle properties.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Constraints**

We are given:

- $ \text{Length}(AC) = 20 $
- $ \text{Length}(AB) = x $ (this is what we're solving for)
- $ \angle CAB = 60^\circ $ — **Note**: This is interpreted as the angle at point $ A $, i.e., $ \angle CAB $, which is the angle between segments $ AC $ and $ AB $.
- $ \angle ABC = 90^\circ $, because $ \overline{BA} \perp \overline{BC} $, indicating a right angle at point $ B $.
- $ \angle ACB = 60^\circ $, as per the notation $ \text{MeasureOf}(Angle(A,C,B)) $

From this, we deduce the internal angles of triangle $ ABC $:

$$
\angle A = 60^\circ,\quad \angle B = 90^\circ,\quad \angle C = 30^\circ
$$

This gives us a classic **30°–60°–90°** right triangle.

---

### **Step 2: Use Properties of a 30°–60°–90° Triangle**

In a 30°–60°–90° triangle:

- The hypotenuse is always twice the shortest leg (opposite the 30° angle).
- The longest leg (opposite the 60° angle) is $ \sqrt{3} $ times the shortest leg.

Here, the **hypotenuse** is $ AC = 20 $. The **shortest leg** is the one opposite the smallest angle, which is $ \angle B = 90^\circ $, so it's actually the **leg adjacent to angle $ C $**, i.e., $ AB $.

Wait — more precisely, in triangle $ ABC $, the angle at $ C = 60^\circ $, so the side opposite that angle is $ AB $, making $ AB $ the **longer leg**. Thus:

$$
AB = AC \cdot \sin(60^\circ) = 20 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 10\sqrt{3}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Final Verification via Coordinates**

Place point $ B $ at the origin $(0, 0)$, point $ C $ on the x-axis at $(10, 0)$, and point $ A $ vertically above $ B $ at $(0, 10\sqrt{3})$. Compute:

- $ AC = \sqrt{(10 - 0)^2 + (0 - 10\sqrt{3})^2} = \sqrt{100 + 300} = \sqrt{400} = 20 $
- $ AB = \sqrt{(0 - 0)^2 + (10\sqrt{3} - 0)^2} = 10\sqrt{3} $

All conditions are satisfied.

---

### **Conclusion**

The length of segment $ AB $, denoted as $ x $, is therefore:

$$
x = 10\sqrt{3}
$$

---

### **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{D}
$$
