MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have quadrilateral EFGH which is a rectangle. The question is asking for the length of EG given that FK is 32 feet. Let me try to visualize this first.

First, since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. Also, diagonals in a rectangle are equal in length and bisect each other. But I need to figure out how the points are arranged here. Let me note down the given conditions:

1. Point K lies on line HG (since PointLiesOnLine(K, Line(H, F)) – wait, hold on. Wait, the first constraint says PointK lies on Line(H, F). Wait, Line(H, F) would be connecting points H and F. Then the second constraint says PointK also lies on Line(E, G). So point K is the intersection of lines HF and EG? Because those two lines are both passing through K?

Also, there's another condition: Perpendicular(Line(H, G), Line(H, E)). That means the lines HG and HE are perpendicular. Wait, but HG is part of the rectangle? Let me think about the structure of the rectangle.

Let me sketch mentally. In rectangle EFGH, the vertices are connected as E-F-G-H-E? Or maybe E-F-G-H connected in order? Wait, rectangles are usually named in order so that consecutive letters are adjacent vertices. So E connected to F, F to G, G to H, H back to E. So EFGH is a rectangle with sides EF, FG, GH, HE.

Now, the given that Perpendicular(Line(H, G), Line(H, E)). So line HG and line HE are perpendicular. But in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. Wait, HE is one side, and HG is another side. Wait, if EFGH is a rectangle, then at vertex H, the sides are HE and HG. Therefore, they should meet at a right angle. So that checks out because in a rectangle, all angles are right angles. So that condition is just confirming that the rectangle is indeed a rectangle. So that's consistent.

But then, point K is lying on both lines HF and EG. So line HF connects points H and F. And line EG connects points E and G. Since EFGH is a rectangle, let's see where these lines intersect.

Wait, in rectangle EFGH, the diagonals are EG and FH. Wait, because in a rectangle, the diagonals connect opposite corners. So diagonal EG connects E to G, and diagonal FH connects F to H. So if point K is on both HF and EG, then K must be the intersection point of the diagonals. Wait, but in a rectangle, the diagonals bisect each other. So their intersection point is the midpoint of both diagonals. Therefore, K is the midpoint of both diagonals. Hence, K is the center of the rectangle.

So given that, FK is half of the diagonal FH. Wait, no. Wait, if K is the midpoint of diagonal FH, then FK is half of FH. But the problem states that FK = 32 feet. So FH is twice that, so 64 feet. However, the question asks for EG, which is the other diagonal. In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal in length. Therefore, EG should also be 64 feet. Wait, but that would mean EG is 64, so answer D. But let me check again.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me go step by step.

Since EFGH is a rectangle, diagonals EG and FH are equal. So EG = FH. If K is the intersection point of diagonals, then K is the midpoint of both diagonals. Therefore, FK is half of FH. So FH = 2 * FK = 64 feet. Thus, EG, being equal to FH, is also 64 feet. So the answer would be D. But let me confirm once more.

Alternatively, perhaps there's something wrong here. Maybe the lines HF and EG aren't the diagonals? Let me re-examine.

Line HF connects H to F. In the rectangle EFGH, H is connected to E and G. F is connected to E and G. So HF is connecting H to F. Which would cross the rectangle. Similarly, EG connects E to G, which is a diagonal. So yes, HF is another diagonal. So in a rectangle, diagonals are EG and FH. So their lengths are equal. Therefore, EG equals FH. Since FK is half of FH (as K is the midpoint), then EG equals FH equals 2*FK = 64. So answer D.

But let me make sure that the problem isn't referring to something else. For example, maybe K is not the intersection of the diagonals? Wait, the problem says that point K lies on both line HF and line EG. So that implies that K is the intersection of HF and EG. In a rectangle, the diagonals intersect at the midpoint. Therefore, K is the midpoint. Therefore, FK is half of FH. Therefore, EG equals FH equals 2*FK=64. So answer D.

But looking at the answer choices, option D is 64. So that seems straightforward. But why is there an option B which is 30? Maybe I'm missing something here. Let me check again.

Wait, could there be a misunderstanding in the notation? For instance, maybe the lines are not the diagonals. Let me consider coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to the rectangle to verify.

Let me place point E at (0, 0). Since it's a rectangle, suppose E(0,0), F(a, 0), G(a, b), H(0, b). So that EF is horizontal, FG vertical, etc. Then the diagonals are EG from (0,0) to (a,b), and FH from (a,0) to (0,b). These diagonals intersect at the midpoint, which would be ((a/2), (b/2)). So point K is this midpoint. Then FK is the distance from F(a,0) to K(a/2, b/2). Let's compute that distance.

Coordinates of F: (a,0)

Coordinates of K: (a/2, b/2)

Distance FK: sqrt[(a - a/2)^2 + (0 - b/2)^2] = sqrt[(a/2)^2 + (b/2)^2] = (sqrt(a² + b²))/2

But according to the problem, FK = 32. Therefore,

sqrt(a² + b²)/2 = 32 → sqrt(a² + b²) = 64 → So the length of the diagonal FH is 64. But in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal, so EG has the same length. Therefore, EG = 64. So answer D.

Therefore, unless there's some error in my coordinate setup, the answer is D. But let me check if the problem refers to EG as a different segment. Wait, EG connects E(0,0) to G(a,b), which is the diagonal. So its length is sqrt(a² + b²) which is 64. So yes, EG is 64. Therefore, the answer is D.

But why is option B present? Maybe the problem is not a rectangle? But the question says that quadrilateral EFGH is a rectangle. Therefore, the answer should be D. Unless there's a miscalculation here.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is referring to EG as a side instead of a diagonal? But in the rectangle EFGH, EG would be a diagonal, not a side. Because E is connected to F and H; G is connected to F and H. So EG connects E to G, which are opposite corners. Therefore, it's a diagonal. So EG is a diagonal, hence length 64. So answer D.

Hmm. So unless there's some other interpretation. Alternatively, maybe the problem involves some triangle or something else. But based on the given information, the logic seems solid. Therefore, I think the correct answer is D. 64.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the length of $ \overline{EG} $ in rectangle $ EFGH $, we begin by analyzing the geometric relationships and applying key properties of rectangles.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**

We are told that quadrilateral $ EFGH $ is a **rectangle**, and the following conditions apply:

- **Point $ K $** lies on both **lines $ HF $** and **$ EG $**
- **Lines $ HG $** and **$ HE $** are **perpendicular**

From this, we can infer that:

- Lines $ HG $ and $ HE $ form a right angle at point $ H $, which confirms that $ EFGH $ is a rectangle (since adjacent sides are always perpendicular in a rectangle).
- The fact that point $ K $ lies on both $ HF $ and $ EG $ indicates that **$ K $ is the intersection of the diagonals** $ \overline{FH} $ and $ \overline{EG} $.

In a rectangle, **the diagonals are congruent** and **bisect each other**. Therefore, point $ K $ is the **midpoint** of both diagonals $ \overline{FH} $ and $ \overline{EG} $.

---

### **Step 2: Use Given Information**

We're told that:

$$
\text{Length of } \overline{FK} = 32 \text{ feet}
$$

Since $ K $ is the midpoint of diagonal $ \overline{FH} $, the full length of $ \overline{FH} $ is:

$$
\overline{FH} = 2 \times \overline{FK} = 2 \times 32 = 64 \text{ feet}
$$

Because the diagonals of a rectangle are **equal in length**, we conclude:

$$
\overline{EG} = \overline{FH} = 64 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

Thus, the length of $ \overline{EG} $ is $ 64 $ feet.

$$
\boxed{\text{Final Answer: D}}
$$
