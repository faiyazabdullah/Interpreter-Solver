MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, first, I need to parse all the given information. Let me start by listing out the constraints:

1. The measure of angle GLJ is 83 degrees. So angle at point L between points G and J is 83°.
2. The measure of angle H L K is 2x - 27 degrees. That's the angle at point L between points H and K.
3. Point B lies on both lines JK and HG. Wait, no—wait, the constraints say PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(J, K)) and PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(H, G)). So point B is the intersection of lines JK and HG? Or maybe it's somewhere along those lines?
4. Points J, K, G, H lie on a circle centered at L with radius 1.0. Because each of them is on the circle with center L and radius 1.0. So that means JL = KL = GL = HL = 1.0 units. Therefore, points J, K, G, H are all on a circle with center L, so they're all equidistant from L. Hence, LJ = LK = LG = LH = radius, which is 1.0. So triangle LGJ, LHK, etc., might have some properties here.

The question is asking whether GH is congruent to KJ. So GH ≅ KJ. We need to find x such that this holds.

First, since all these points (J, K, G, H) are on a circle with center L, then the distances from L to each of these points are equal. So, for example, LG = LJ = LK = LH = 1.0. Therefore, triangles like LGJ and LKH would be isosceles triangles?

Wait, but GH and KJ are chords of the circle. If two chords are congruent, their lengths are equal. But how does that relate to angles?

Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that in a circle, the length of a chord depends on its central angle. For example, the length of chord AB is 2r sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle subtended by the chord AB. Since all radii are equal (radius 1.0), then if two chords have the same central angle, they are congruent. So GH and KJ being congruent would mean their corresponding central angles are equal.

But wait, GH is the chord connecting points G and H, and KJ is the chord connecting points K and J. So the central angles for these chords would be the angles at the center L between those pairs of points.

So, the central angle for GH would be angle GLH, and for KJ, it's angle JLK? Wait, no. Let me think again. The central angle for chord GH would be the angle at the center L between points G and H. Similarly, the central angle for chord KJ is the angle at L between points K and J.

Therefore, if GH ≅ KJ, then their central angles must be equal. So angle GLH equals angle JLK?

Wait, but maybe there's another way. Alternatively, perhaps using inscribed angles?

Alternatively, since we know some angles at point L, maybe we can relate them.

Looking back at the given angles:

Angle GLJ is 83 degrees. Let me visualize this. Point L is the center of the circle. So points G, J, K, H are on the circumference. Angle GLJ is formed by points G, L, J. Wait, but L is the center. So angle GLJ is actually an angle at the center between points G and J. Wait, no. Wait, angle at L between points G and J. Wait, the notation Angle(G, L, J) means the angle at point L between points G and J. So yes, that's the central angle between points G and J. So the measure of angle GLJ is 83 degrees, meaning that arc GJ has measure 83 degrees. Similarly, angle H L K is the angle at L between H and K, so that's the central angle for arc HK, which measures 2x - 27 degrees.

Now, since all four points G, H, J, K are on the circle centered at L, and if GH ≅ KJ, then their arcs should be congruent. Therefore, the central angles for GH and KJ should be equal. Let me check that.

Wait, chord GH corresponds to the arc between G and H, which would correspond to the central angle ∠GLH. Similarly, chord KJ corresponds to arc between K and J, which would correspond to central angle ∠JKL? Wait, maybe I need to clarify.

Let me consider the positions of the points. Suppose we have a circle with center L. Points G, J, K, H are on the circumference. Now, the chord GH connects G and H, so the central angle for that chord is the angle between LG and LH. Similarly, chord KJ connects K and J, so the central angle is between LK and LJ.

If GH ≅ KJ, then their respective central angles must be equal. Therefore, angle(GLH) = angle(LJK)? Wait, but angle(GLH) would be the central angle for GH, and angle(LJK) would be the central angle for KJ?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me take it step by step.

For chord GH: the central angle is the angle at L between points G and H. So that's angle GLH.

For chord KJ: the central angle is the angle at L between points K and J. Which is angle JKL? No, the angle at L between K and J would be angle J L K. Wait, angle at L between K and J is ∠JLK, right? Because the angle at L between points J and K is ∠JLK. So if the chord is KJ, then the central angle is ∠JLK.

So if GH ≅ KJ, then ∠GLH = ∠JLK.

But do we have any relations between these angles?

Alternatively, maybe considering the total around point L. Since all points are on the circle, the sum of central angles around L should be 360 degrees.

But we have some angles given. Let's see:

We know angle GLJ is 83 degrees. That's angle at L between G and J, so that's part of the circle. Also, angle H L K is 2x - 27 degrees, which is angle at L between H and K.

Additionally, since points G, H, J, K are on the circle, maybe there are relationships between the angles.

Wait, but we also have that point B lies on both lines JK and HG. Hmm. Maybe that's important for something else. But maybe not directly related unless there's more info.

Alternatively, maybe the diagram forms certain triangles or quadrilaterals. However, without knowing the exact configuration, maybe we can assume that the points are arranged in order around the circle?

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that since GH ≅ KJ, their central angles are equal, leading us to set up equations based on the known angles.

Let me think again. Let's denote the central angles:

Let’s define:

Central angle for arc GJ: ∠GLJ = 83°, as given.

Central angle for arc HK: ∠HLK = 2x - 27°, as given.

Also, since all points are on the circle, the sum of all arcs around L should be 360°. However, depending on how the points are ordered, the arcs may vary. For example, if the points are arranged as G, J, K, H around the circle, then the arcs could be GJ, JK, KH, HG, adding up to 360°. But without knowing the order, this might be tricky.

However, if GH ≅ KJ, then their arcs are congruent. So arc GH is congruent to arc KJ. Therefore, the central angles for those arcs are equal.

So, arc GH corresponds to central angle ∠GLH, and arc KJ corresponds to central angle ∠JLK. Therefore, ∠GLH = ∠JLK.

But how can we express ∠GLH and ∠JLK in terms of the given angles?

Alternatively, maybe we can find expressions for those angles using the given angles.

Let me try to imagine the circle with center L. Let me label the points. Let me suppose that points are placed in the order G, J, K, H around the circle. Not sure if that's correct, but just trying to visualize.

Given that angle GLJ is 83°, which is the central angle between G and J. Then angle H L K is 2x - 27°, which is the central angle between H and K. 

Assuming the points are arranged in order G, J, K, H around the circle, then moving from G to J to K to H. Then, the arc from G to J is 83°, arc from J to K would be something, arc from K to H is 2x - 27°, and then arc from H back to G would be the remaining part. 

But since GH ≅ KJ, the arc GH should equal arc KJ. Arc GH would be the arc from G to H, which would be the sum of arcs GK + KH? Wait, no. If the points are G, J, K, H in order, then arc GH would go through J and K? No, arc GH would depend on the direction. But since we're talking about central angles, arc GH can be considered as the smaller arc between G and H, which could be either going clockwise or counterclockwise. 

Alternatively, if GH ≅ KJ, then their arcs are equal. So the measure of arc GH equals measure of arc KJ. 

Arc KJ is the arc from K to J, which would be the same as arc JK. Depending on the arrangement, but assuming the points are in order, maybe arc KJ would be the arc going from K to J passing through H and G? Not sure.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's another approach.

Since all points are on the circle with center L, then the distance from L to each point is the same (radius 1). So, the segments LG, LJ, LK, LH are all radii of the circle. Therefore, triangles LGJ, LHK, etc., are isosceles triangles.

For example, triangle LGJ has sides LG and LJ equal (both radii), so it's an isosceles triangle with base GJ. Similarly, triangle LHK has sides LH and LK equal, making it isosceles with base HK.

Given that, maybe we can find some relations between angles.

Wait, but we already know the measure of angle GLJ, which is the vertex angle of triangle LGJ. In triangle LGJ, the two equal sides are LG and LJ, so the base angles at G and J are equal. Wait, no—the vertex angle is at L, because angle GLJ is at L. Wait, no. Wait, angle GLJ is at point L, between points G and J. So in triangle GLJ, the angle at L is 83°, and the other two angles at G and J are equal. Let me calculate those angles.

In triangle LGJ, the sum of angles is 180°. So:

angle at L: 83°, angles at G and J: let's call them α each.

So 83 + 2α = 180 → 2α = 97 → α = 48.5°. So angles at G and J are 48.5° each.

Similarly, looking at triangle LHK, where angle at L is 2x - 27°, which is the angle H L K. So similar logic applies. The triangle LHK has sides LH and LK equal (radii), so it's isosceles with base HK. Therefore, the base angles at H and K are equal. Let me compute those angles.

Let β be the base angles at H and K.

Then, angle at L: 2x - 27°, so:

(2x - 27) + 2β = 180 → 2β = 180 - (2x - 27) = 180 - 2x + 27 = 207 - 2x → β = (207 - 2x)/2.

But how does this help us?

Now, returning to the main question: GH ≅ KJ. As chords, their lengths are equal. Since they are chords of the same circle, their lengths depend on their central angles. So if GH ≅ KJ, then their central angles must be equal. Therefore, the central angle for GH equals the central angle for KJ.

What is the central angle for GH? It's the angle at L between points G and H. Let's denote that as γ. Similarly, the central angle for KJ is the angle at L between points K and J, which we'll call δ.

So γ = δ.

Now, how can we express γ and δ in terms of the known angles?

Let me think about the entire circle. The sum of all central angles around point L is 360°. Let's consider the central angles between consecutive points.

Suppose the points are arranged in the order G, J, K, H around the circle. Then the central angles would be:

Between G and J: 83° (given).

Between J and K: ?

Between K and H: 2x - 27° (given).

Between H and G: ?

But we don't know these yet. However, if we can find the relationship between these angles.

But since we have the condition that the central angle for GH equals that for KJ.

The central angle for GH would be the angle between G and H. If the points are in order G, J, K, H, then the central angle for GH would be the sum of the arcs from G to J, J to K, and K to H? No, that would be the major arc. Wait, the central angle between G and H could be the minor arc or major arc, depending on the position. Assuming the points are arranged in order, the minor arc GH would be the shorter path between G and H.

But without knowing the exact order, it's hard to tell. However, maybe we can consider that the central angle for GH is equal to the sum of arcs GJ and JK, or something like that? Not sure.

Alternatively, since we have two central angles: arc GJ is 83°, arc HK is 2x - 27°, and we need to relate the rest.

If we can find the central angle for GH and KJ, then set them equal.

Let me think differently. Let's denote the central angles between each pair of adjacent points.

Assume the points are arranged in the order G, J, K, H around the circle. Then the arcs would be:

arc GJ = 83° (as given),

arc JK = ?

arc KH = 2x - 27°,

arc HG = ?

Total sum of arcs = 360°, so:

83 + arc JK + (2x - 27) + arc HG = 360.

But we don't know arc JK or arc HG.

But GH ≅ KJ implies that arc GH equals arc KJ. What is arc GH? If the points are in order G, J, K, H, then arc GH would be arc from G to H passing through J and K? Or the other way?

Actually, arc GH can be measured in two ways. The minor arc GH would be the smaller of the two possible arcs between G and H. If the points are arranged in order G, J, K, H, then arc GH going through J and K would be longer than arc GH going through H... Wait, no. From G to H, if you go through J and K, that's the long way around. The short way would be the direct arc from G to H, which would pass through the opposite side. But without knowing the exact positions, it's ambiguous.

Alternatively, since arc KJ is the arc from K to J. If points are in order G, J, K, H, then arc KJ would be the arc from K to J going the other way, which would be the arc from K to H to G to J? Not sure.

This seems too vague. Perhaps there's another approach.

Earlier, I had thought about the central angles for chords GH and KJ. Let's recall that the central angle for chord GH is the angle at L between G and H, which we called γ. Similarly, for KJ, it's angle at L between K and J, which we called δ.

So γ = δ.

But how to find γ and δ?

Well, let's note that the central angle for GH (γ) plus the central angle for arc from H to G (which is the other arc) equals 360°. But maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, if we can express γ and δ in terms of the known angles.

For example, if we consider the full circle, the sum of all central angles is 360°. Suppose we have arcs:

arc GJ = 83°,

arc JK = y,

arc KH = 2x - 27°,

arc HG = z.

So 83 + y + (2x - 27) + z = 360 ⇒ y + z = 360 - 83 + 27 - 2x = 360 - 56 - 2x = 304 - 2x. Wait, 83 + (2x - 27) = 83 - 27 + 2x = 56 + 2x. So total sum is 56 + 2x + y + z = 360 ⇒ y + z = 360 - 56 - 2x = 304 - 2x.

But we need to relate y and z to γ and δ.

Wait, γ is the central angle for GH. If the points are in order G, J, K, H, then arc GH would be arc GJ + arc JK + arc KH? No, that would be the arc from G to H through J and K, which would be 83 + y + (2x - 27). But that would be the major arc if the points are in order. Whereas the minor arc GH would be arc HG, which is z. But this depends on the actual positions.

Alternatively, if arc GH is the minor arc, then it would be z, and arc KJ would be arc from K to J. If points are in order G, J, K, H, then arc KJ would be the arc from K to J going the other way, which would be arc KH + arc HG + arc GJ? No, that's confusing.

Maybe instead of focusing on arcs, think about the angles at L.

We know angle GLJ is 83°, which is the central angle between G and J. Similarly, angle H L K is 2x - 27°, central angle between H and K.

Now, what is the central angle between G and H? That would depend on the positions. Let me try to imagine that the points are arranged such that moving from G to J to K to H around the circle.

Then, the central angle between G and H would be the sum of arc GJ (83°) and arc JK (y). But that would be the arc from G to H via J, which is the larger arc if arc JK is significant. Alternatively, the smaller arc would be arc from G to H going through the other side, which would be arc HG (z).

But since GH ≅ KJ, their lengths are equal, so their central angles are equal. So the central angle for GH is equal to the central angle for KJ.

What is the central angle for KJ? That would be the central angle between K and J. If the points are in order G, J, K, H, then the central angle between K and J would be the arc from K to J going the other way, which would be arc KH + arc HG + arc GJ? No, that's not right. Let me think.

From K to J: if the points are in order G, J, K, H, then the arc from K to J can be either the small arc K to J passing through G (which would be arc KG + arc GJ?) Or the arc going the other way. Wait, the arc from K to J can be considered as the arc that goes from K to H to G to J, which would be arc KH + arc HG + arc GJ. But that's likely the major arc. Whereas the minor arc from K to J would be arc KJ directly, which would be arc from K to J passing through H? Wait, no. If the points are in order G, J, K, H, then the arc from K to J would be the arc going from K to J through H and G? Or is there a direct arc?

Actually, in a circle, the arc between two points can be minor or major. But since we are dealing with central angles, we usually consider the smaller arc unless specified otherwise. So for arc KJ, the central angle would be the smaller arc between K and J.

If the points are in order G, J, K, H around the circle, then the arc from K to J would be the arc going from K to H to G to J, which is the major arc, while the minor arc would be the arc from K to J passing through the other side, which would be the arc from K to J directly. But this depends on the positions.

This seems too ambiguous without knowing the exact configuration. Maybe there's a different approach.

Wait, earlier, we had the idea that GH ≅ KJ implies their central angles are equal. Let me denote that the central angle for GH is equal to that for KJ. Let's call this angle θ.

So, θ = central angle for GH = central angle for KJ.

Now, let's try to find θ in terms of the known angles.

Let me consider that the central angle between G and J is 83°, and between H and K is 2x - 27°. How do these relate to θ?

Perhaps considering the sum of angles around point L.

The total of all central angles is 360°. Let's assume that the points are arranged in such a way that the central angles between G-J, J-K, K-H, and H-G make up the whole circle. Wait, but we only know two of these angles: G-J is 83°, and K-H is 2x - 27°. The others are unknown.

But if GH and KJ are congruent chords, their central angles are equal. So, the central angle between G and H (which is θ) is equal to the central angle between K and J (also θ).

So, if we can express θ in terms of the known angles.

Let me think: the central angle between G and H can be expressed as the sum of the central angles between G-J and J-K, or subtracted depending on the direction. Wait, if the points are in order G, J, K, H, then the central angle between G and H is the sum of arc GJ and arc JK. But that would be the major arc if arc JK is large enough. Alternatively, if we consider the minor arc, it might be the other way.

But since we don't know the order, this is still unclear. However, maybe there's a relation between the known angles and θ.

Alternatively, think about the triangle formed by points G, H, and L. Since LG = LH = 1.0, triangle GLH is isosceles with legs LG and LH. The base angles at G and H are equal. Wait, but we don't know the angles here yet.

Wait, earlier, for triangle GLJ, we found that the base angles were 48.5°. Maybe similar reasoning applies for other triangles.

Wait, let's consider triangle GLH. It's an isosceles triangle with LG = LH = 1.0. The angle at L is the central angle between G and H, which is θ. So, the base angles at G and H would be equal. Let's call them γ. Then, θ + 2γ = 180°, so γ = (180° - θ)/2.

Similarly, for triangle KJL. Wait, point J and K are on the circle. If we consider triangle JKL, which has sides LJ = LK = 1.0. The angle at L is the central angle between J and K, which is arc JK. Let me denote that as φ. Then, the base angles at J and K would be (180° - φ)/2.

But how does this help?

Alternatively, maybe considering the angles at points G and H, or J and K, relating to other parts of the diagram.

But we also have point B lying on both lines JK and HG. This suggests that lines JK and HG intersect at point B. Maybe this creates some vertical angles or similar triangles?

But without knowing specific details about line B, it's hard to proceed. Maybe this is a red herring, or maybe it's essential for determining the configuration.

Wait, if point B is on both lines JK and HG, then lines JK and HG intersect at B. This might imply that certain triangles are similar or that certain angles are equal.

Alternatively, since B is on both lines, maybe we can consider some cyclic quadrilateral or use power of a point?

Alternatively, since B is on both lines, maybe there are some vertical angles or alternate interior angles that can be used.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to think of another way.

Going back to the earlier idea that GH ≅ KJ implies their central angles are equal, so θ = central angle for GH = central angle for KJ.

Let me denote the central angle between G and J as 83°, and between H and K as 2x - 27°. Let me assume that the central angles between G and H and between K and J are equal.

But how to express these in terms of the known angles?

If I imagine that the central angle between G and H is equal to the central angle between K and J, then:

central angle GH = central angle KJ.

But the central angle between G and H can be expressed as the sum of central angles between G-J and J-H, or something like that. Wait, if the points are arranged such that moving from G to J to K to H, then the central angle between G and H would be the sum of arc GJ (83°) and arc JK (let's call it y), which would give 83 + y. However, if this is the case, then the central angle between G and H is 83 + y, and the central angle between K and J would be the arc from K to J, which would be arc K-H + arc H-G, which is (2x - 27) + z, where z is arc HG.

But since GH ≅ KJ, their central angles are equal, so:

83 + y = (2x - 27) + z.

But we also know from the total circle that:

arc GJ + arc JK + arc KH + arc HG = 360°.

Which is:

83 + y + (2x - 27) + z = 360.

So, substituting the previous equation into this:

(83 + y) + (2x - 27) + z = 360.

But from above, 83 + y = (2x - 27) + z. Let me substitute that into the equation:

[(2x - 27) + z] + (2x - 27) + z = 360.

Wait, no. Wait, the total is:

(arc GJ) + (arc JK) + (arc KH) + (arc HG) = 83 + y + (2x - 27) + z = 360.

But we also have 83 + y = (2x - 27) + z.

Substituting 83 + y into the total equation:

(2x - 27 + z) + (2x - 27) + z = 360.

Wait, no. Wait, arc GJ is 83, arc JK is y, arc KH is (2x - 27), arc HG is z.

So total is 83 + y + (2x - 27) + z = 360.

But from GH ≅ KJ, we have 83 + y = (2x - 27) + z.

So substituting 83 + y with (2x - 27) + z in the total equation:

(2x - 27) + z + (2x - 27) + z = 360.

Combine terms:

2*(2x - 27) + 2*z = 360.

Divide both sides by 2:

(2x - 27) + z = 180.

So, z = 180 - (2x - 27) = 180 - 2x + 27 = 207 - 2x.

But we also had from the equality 83 + y = (2x - 27) + z, and z = 207 - 2x, so:

83 + y = (2x - 27) + (207 - 2x) = 2x - 27 + 207 - 2x = 180.

Thus, 83 + y = 180 ⇒ y = 180 - 83 = 97°.

So arc JK is 97°, and arc HG is z = 207 - 2x.

Now, we need another equation to solve for x. Where can we get this?

Perhaps by considering the central angle for arc KJ, which is the same as arc JK, which we've just found to be 97°, but wait, arc JK is 97°, which is the central angle between J and K. Wait, but earlier we said that the central angle between K and J (for chord KJ) is equal to the central angle between G and H (for chord GH), which was 83 + y = 180°. Wait, no—earlier, we had that the central angle between G and H is equal to the central angle between K and J. Wait, but we found that the central angle between G and H is 83 + y = 180°, and the central angle between K and J is arc KJ, which is y? Wait, no.

Wait, arc JK is y = 97°, which is the central angle between J and K. But the central angle between K and J is the same as between J and K, so it's also 97°. Therefore, the central angle between K and J is 97°, which equals the central angle between G and H, which is 180°? Wait, no. Earlier, we said that the central angle for GH equals the central angle for KJ, which would mean that the central angle between G and H equals the central angle between K and J. But we just found that the central angle between K and J is 97°, and the central angle between G and H is 83 + y = 180°. So setting them equal gives 180 = 97, which is impossible. This suggests a contradiction, so my assumption must be wrong.

Hmm, where did I go wrong?

Ah! I think I made a mistake in defining which arcs correspond to which central angles. Let me re-examine.

Earlier, I assumed that the central angle between G and H is 83 + y, where y is arc JK. But this assumes that the arc from G to H passes through J and K, which would make it the major arc if the points are arranged in order G, J, K, H. But if GH is supposed to be a chord, then the central angle for GH would be the smaller arc between G and H. So if the points are arranged in order G, J, K, H, then the arc from G to H could be the minor arc passing through the other side, which would be arc HG, which is z. So the central angle between G and H is z, and the central angle between K and J is y.

So if GH ≅ KJ, then their central angles are equal, so z = y.

Wait, previously, I had arc JK = y = 97°, and arc HG = z = 207 - 2x. Setting z = y gives 207 - 2x = 97 → 2x = 207 - 97 = 110 → x = 55.

That seems promising! Let me verify this.

So, if GH ≅ KJ, then their central angles are equal. The central angle for GH is arc HG, which is z, and the central angle for KJ is arc JK, which is y. So z = y.

Earlier, we derived that y = 97°, and z = 207 - 2x. Setting z = y:

207 - 2x = 97 → 2x = 207 - 97 = 110 → x = 55. So x = 55, which is option C.

But let me check this again step by step.

We started with the assumption that GH ≅ KJ → central angles are equal. The central angle for GH is arc HG (z), and for KJ is arc JK (y). So z = y.

From earlier steps:

We had:

arc GJ = 83°, arc KH = 2x - 27°, arc JK = y, arc HG = z.

Total: 83 + y + (2x - 27) + z = 360.

And from GH ≅ KJ → z = y.

So substituting z = y:

83 + y + (2x - 27) + y = 360 → 83 + 2y + 2x - 27 = 360 → (83 - 27) + 2y + 2x = 360 → 56 + 2y + 2x = 360 → 2y + 2x = 304 → y + x = 152.

But we also had from earlier when we substituted the equality of central angles. Wait, earlier I had a different path where I thought that 83 + y = (2x - 27) + z, but that might have been incorrect. Let me redo that.

Wait, initially, I thought that the central angle for GH (which is z) equals the central angle for KJ (which is y). So z = y.

But earlier, I incorrectly derived an equation where I thought that 83 + y = (2x - 27) + z, but that was under a wrong assumption. Let me correct that.

With z = y, the total becomes:

83 + y + (2x - 27) + y = 360 → 83 - 27 + 2y + 2x = 360 → 56 + 2y + 2x = 360 → 2y + 2x = 304 → y + x = 152.

But we need another equation to solve for x. Where can we get it?

Let me recall that we also had from the central angles in triangles. Earlier, we looked at triangle GLJ, where the base angles at G and J were 48.5° each. Is there any relation to other angles?

Wait, maybe considering triangle HLG. Since LG = LH = 1.0, and the central angle at L between G and H is z. So, in triangle GLH, the base angles at G and H are equal, each being (180° - z)/2.

Similarly, in triangle JKL, which has sides LJ = LK = 1.0, and central angle at L between J and K is y. So the base angles at J and K are (180° - y)/2.

But how does this help? Unless there's some relationship between these angles and other parts of the diagram.

Alternatively, since point B lies on lines JK and HG, maybe there are some vertical angles or something.

Wait, if lines JK and HG intersect at point B, then the vertical angles at B are equal. For example, angle between JB and BK equals angle between HB and BG. But without more information, it's hard to connect this.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that points G, H, J, K are on the circle, and B is the intersection of JK and HG, implying that B is the radical center or something? Not sure.

Alternatively, since B is on both lines, maybe there are some properties of intersecting chords. Like, when two chords intersect, the products of their segments are equal. But since B is on both lines, if JK and HG intersect at B, then we have:

JB * BK = HB * BG.

But we don't know the lengths of these segments. However, since all points are on a circle with radius 1, maybe we can relate these lengths?

But this might be too complex without more information.

Alternatively, maybe there's another equation involving x from the angles at point L.

Wait, what's the total of all central angles around point L? It should be 360°. So, we have:

arc GJ = 83°,

arc JK = y,

arc KH = 2x - 27°,

arc HG = z.

And since z = y, as per GH ≅ KJ.

So total is 83 + y + (2x - 27) + y = 360 → 83 + 2y + 2x - 27 = 360 → 56 + 2y + 2x = 360 → 2y + 2x = 304 → y + x = 152.

So we have one equation: x + y = 152.

But we need another equation to solve for x. Where can we get this?

Wait, maybe considering the triangle LJK or something else.

Wait, earlier, we considered triangle GLJ, which gave us the base angles at G and J as 48.5°. Similarly, if we look at triangle LJK, which has sides LJ = LK = 1.0, and central angle at L between J and K, which is y. So the base angles at J and K would be (180° - y)/2.

But what is the relationship between these angles and other parts?

Wait, maybe considering triangle JKL, and triangle GLJ. Are there any connections?

Alternatively, since point B lies on lines JK and HG, maybe we can find some relations between the angles at B?

But without knowing specific angles or lengths, it's difficult.

Wait, but perhaps there's another relationship from the initial angles given. We had angle GLJ = 83°, and angle H L K = 2x - 27°. These are central angles. Are there any relationships between these angles and the others?

Wait, the central angle at L between G and J is 83°, and between H and K is 2x - 27°. If we can find a relationship between these angles and the others.

But since the total of all central angles is 360°, and we have:

arc GJ = 83°, arc KH = 2x - 27°, arc JK = y, arc HG = y.

So total: 83 + y + (2x - 27) + y = 360 → as before, y + x = 152.

But we need another equation. Perhaps there's a relationship between y and the other angles?

Wait, let's think about the angles at point L. The central angles are 83°, y, 2x - 27°, and y. So total is 83 + y + (2x - 27) + y = 360.

But we also have from the angles in the triangles. For example, in triangle GLJ, we found the base angles at G and J to be 48.5° each. Similarly, in triangle LHK, the base angles at H and K are β = (207 - 2x)/2, as calculated earlier.

But how do these angles relate to other parts?

Let me consider the angles at points G and J. For example, at point G, we have angle between LG and HG. But since LG is a radius and HG is a chord, maybe this relates to the central angle?

Alternatively, maybe considering the inscribed angles. But since L is the center, not sure.

Wait, another idea: since points G, J, K, H are on the circle, and B is the intersection of lines JK and HG, then maybe quadrilateral GJKH is cyclic? Well, it's already on the circle, so it is cyclic. But how does that help?

Alternatively, since B is on both lines, maybe applying the Power of a Point theorem. For point B, the product of the segments of one chord equals the product for the other.

So, for point B on chords JK and HG, we have:

JB * BK = HB * BG.

But since we don't know the lengths, but all points are on a circle of radius 1, maybe we can express these lengths in terms of the central angles?

Wait, for example, the length of segment JB can be calculated if we know the central angle subtended by arc JB. But without knowing where B is located, it's challenging.

Alternatively, since we don't have specific lengths, maybe this approach isn't feasible.

Back to the equation x + y = 152. We need another equation. Let me think.

Is there a way to relate y with the angles in the triangles?

Earlier, we had in triangle LHK, the base angles at H and K were β = (207 - 2x)/2.

Similarly, in triangle GLJ, the base angles at G and J were 48.5°.

But how does this relate to other parts?

At point J, there are two angles: one from triangle GLJ (which is 48.5°) and possibly another from triangle JKL.

Wait, at point J, the angle between LJ and JK is part of the triangle JKL. Let me think.

In triangle JKL, the angle at J is (180° - y)/2, as mentioned earlier.

But also, at point J, there's an angle from triangle GLJ, which is 48.5°. Are these angles related?

Yes! At point J, the angle between GJ and JL is 48.5° (from triangle GLJ). And the angle between JL and JK is (180° - y)/2 (from triangle JKL). Since these two angles are adjacent at point J, their sum should be equal to the total angle at point J, which is determined by the configuration.

Wait, but point J is on the circle, so the total angle at point J would be the sum of the angles from the two triangles. Let me explain.

At point J, we have two lines: one going to G (part of line JG) and another going to K (part of line JK). The angle between these two lines at J is the angle between GJ and JK. But this angle is composed of two parts: the angle from triangle GLJ (which is 48.5°) and the angle from triangle JKL (which is (180° - y)/2). Wait, no. Actually, the angle at point J between GJ and JK would be the angle between lines JG and JK, which is the angle at J in the diagram. But how is this related to the triangles?

Actually, the angle at J between GJ and JL is 48.5°, and the angle at J between JL and JK is (180° - y)/2. So, the total angle at point J between GJ and JK is 48.5° + (180° - y)/2.

But since points G, J, K, H are on a circle, the angle between GJ and JK at point J is an inscribed angle? Or is it related to the central angles?

Wait, no. The angle at point J between GJ and JK is not necessarily an inscribed angle; it's just a regular angle. However, since points G, J, K are on the circle, this angle is related to the arcs.

Actually, the angle at point J between GJ and JK is an inscribed angle subtending arc GK. Wait, no. The angle at point J between GJ and JK would subtend arc from G to K, excluding J. So, the measure of that angle is half the measure of the arc from G to K.

Wait, let me recall: the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its subtended arc. So, if we have an angle at point J between points G and K, then it subtends arc GK, and its measure is half of that arc.

But in our case, the angle at J between GJ and JK is indeed an inscribed angle subtending arc GK. Let me calculate the measure of this angle.

The measure of this angle is (1/2)(measure of arc GK).

But arc GK can be calculated as the sum of arc GJ + arc JK = 83 + y.

Wait, arc GK would be from G to K, passing through J, so it's arc GJ + arc JK = 83 + y.

Thus, the measure of the angle at J between GJ and JK is (83 + y)/2.

But earlier, we also said that this angle is equal to 48.5° + (180° - y)/2. So:

(83 + y)/2 = 48.5 + (180 - y)/2.

Let me write this equation:

(83 + y)/2 = 48.5 + (180 - y)/2.

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate denominators:

83 + y = 97 + 180 - y.

Simplify RHS: 97 + 180 = 277, so:

83 + y = 277 - y.

Bring variables to left and constants to right:

y + y = 277 - 83 → 2y = 194 → y = 97°.

So we have y = 97°, which matches our earlier calculation!

Now, recall that we had the equation from before: x + y = 152. Substituting y = 97°:

x + 97 = 152 → x = 152 - 97 = 55.

So x = 55, which corresponds to option C.

Let me double-check everything.

We found that y = 97°, which is arc JK. Then, from x + y = 152, x = 55. This makes sense.

Let me confirm the steps again:

1. Established that GH ≅ KJ implies their central angles are equal, leading to z = y.

2. Set up the total central angles: 83 + y + (2x - 27) + y = 360 → simplified to x + y = 152.

3. Used the angle at point J to derive another equation, finding y = 97°.

4. Solved for x = 152 - 97 = 55.

All steps seem consistent. Thus, x = 55, which is option C.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{C}

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we begin by interpreting the geometric setup described in the problem. All points $ G, H, J, K $ lie on a **circle** centered at point $ L $, with radius 1.0. This implies that $ LG = LJ = LK = LH = 1 $, i.e., all these segments are radii of the circle.

---

### Step 1: Understanding Given Angles

- The measure of angle $ \angle GLJ $ is given as $ 83^\circ $.  
  Since $ L $ is the center of the circle, this is the **central angle** corresponding to the arc $ \overset{\frown}{GJ} $, so:
  $$
  m(\overset{\frown}{GJ}) = 83^\circ
  $$

- The measure of angle $ \angle H L K $ is given as $ 2x - 27^\circ $, which is the central angle corresponding to the arc $ \overset{\frown}{HK} $, so:
  $$
  m(\overset{\frown}{HK}) = 2x - 27^\circ
  $$

---

### Step 2: Using Congruent Chords and Central Angles

It is stated that:
$$
GH \cong KJ
$$

Chords of a circle are congruent **if and only if** their corresponding **central angles** are equal. Therefore, the central angles corresponding to chords $ GH $ and $ KJ $ must be equal:
$$
m(\overset{\frown}{GH}) = m(\overset{\frown}{KJ})
$$

Let us denote:
- The central angle for $ \overset{\frown}{GH} $ as $ z $
- The central angle for $ \overset{\frown}{KJ} $ as $ y $

Thus,
$$
z = y
$$

---

### Step 3: Total Sum of Central Angles Around the Center

Since all points lie on a circle centered at $ L $, the sum of all central angles around the center must equal $ 360^\circ $. The arcs involved are:
- $ \overset{\frown}{GJ} = 83^\circ $
- $ \overset{\frown}{JK} = y $
- $ \overset{\frown}{KH} = 2x - 27^\circ $
- $ \overset{\frown}{HG} = z $

Using the fact that $ z = y $, the total becomes:
$$
83 + y + (2x - 27) + y = 360
$$
$$
83 + 2y + 2x - 27 = 360
$$
$$
2y + 2x + 56 = 360
$$
$$
2(y + x) = 304
\Rightarrow y + x = 152 \tag{1}
$$

---

### Step 4: Use of Inscribed Angle at Point $ J $

Consider the angle at point $ J $ formed by the chords $ \overrightarrow{JG} $ and $ \overrightarrow{JK} $. This angle is an **inscribed angle** that subtends arc $ \overset{\frown}{GK} $, whose measure is:
$$
m(\overset{\frown}{GK}) = m(\overset{\frown}{GJ}) + m(\overset{\frown}{JK}) = 83 + y
$$
So the measure of the inscribed angle at point $ J $ is:
$$
\frac{1}{2}(83 + y)
$$

This angle can also be broken down into:
- An angle from triangle $ \triangle GLJ $, which contributes $ 48.5^\circ $ (since the triangle is isosceles with apex angle $ 83^\circ $)
- Another angle from triangle $ \triangle JKL $, with base angle:
$$
\frac{1}{2}(180 - y) = \frac{180 - y}{2}
$$

Equating the two expressions for the angle at $ J $:
$$
\frac{83 + y}{2} = 48.5 + \frac{180 - y}{2}
$$

Multiply both sides by 2:
$$
83 + y = 97 + 180 - y
$$
$$
83 + y = 277 - y
$$
$$
2y = 194 \Rightarrow y = 97
$$

---

### Step 5: Solve for $ x $

Plug $ y = 97 $ into Equation (1):
$$
x + 97 = 152 \Rightarrow x = 55
$$

---
