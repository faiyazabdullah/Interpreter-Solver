====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So we have a bunch of angle measures given as equalities, and some points lying on certain lines. The question is asking for the measure of angle 13, given that angle 3 is 110 degrees and angle 12 is 55 degrees. 

First, I need to visualize or maybe sketch the diagram based on the given constraints. But since there's no actual image provided, I'll have to rely on the relationships between the angles and the points mentioned. Let me start by listing out all the given information:

Given Equal Angles:
- Angle at K-A-J (which is ∠KAJ) equals angle 13.
- Angle at E-A-K (∠EAK) equals angle 14.
- Angle at D-H-F (∠DHF) equals angle 3 (given as 110°).
- Angle at C-I-B (∠CIB) equals angle 2.
- Angle at D-I-C (∠DIC) equals angle 1.
- Angle at B-H-E (∠BHE) equals angle 8.
- Angle at C-A-E (∠CAE) equals angle 10.
- Angle at G-E-A (∠GEA) equals angle 15.
- Angle at F-E-L (∠FEL) equals angle 12 (given as 55°).
- Angle at A-I-D (∠AID) equals angle 5.
- Angle at J-A-C (∠JAC) equals angle 9.
- Angle at B-I-A (∠BIA) equals angle 6.
- Angle at L-E-G (∠LEG) equals angle 16.
- Angle at A-E-F (∠AEF) equals angle 11.
- Angle at E-H-I (∠EHI) equals angle 7.
- Angle at F-H-B (∠FHB) equals angle 4.

Also, several point-line relationships:
- Point I lies on line AC.
- Point E lies on line AL.
- Point A lies on line CK.
- Point I lies on line CK.
- Point H lies on line EF.
- Point A lies on line EJ.
- Point H lies on line IB.
- Point A lies on line IK.
- Point A lies on line JL.
- Point E lies on line JL.
- Point H lies on line BD.
- Point I lies on line BD.
- Point I lies on line DH.
- Point E lies on line HG.
- Point E lies on line FG.
- Point H lies on line FG.
- Lines CI and HF are parallel.

So first, I need to map out how these points connect. Since there are multiple lines and points, it might help to consider each line and see which points lie on them. For example, line AC has points A, C, and I (since I lies on line AC). Also, line CK passes through A (as per Point A lies on line CK). Wait, but line CK would go through points C, K, and A? Because point A is on line CK. Similarly, point I is also on line CK. So points C, K, A, I are colinear?

Wait, the points on line CK include A and I. So line CK passes through A and I. Also, point A is on line CK. So that suggests that line CK goes through points C, then K, then A, then I? Or perhaps C connected to K, passing through A and I. Not sure yet. Similarly, line EF has H on it. Points E, F, H are colinear. Also, H lies on line BD and on line FG. And line FG is part of the parallel condition with line CI. Hmm.

Since lines CI and HF are parallel. So line CI is parallel to line HF. That could imply some corresponding angles or alternate interior angles if they're cut by a transversal.

Let me think about the angles given. We know angle 3 is 110°, which is ∠DHF. So angle at D-H-F is 110°, meaning that triangle D-H-F has an angle of 110° at H. Also, angle 12 is 55°, which is ∠FEL. So angle at F-E-L is 55°, so maybe triangle F-E-L has that angle at E.

But since lines are involved, maybe there are parallel lines creating similar triangles or using properties like alternate interior angles, corresponding angles, etc.

Another thing to note: Since line CI is parallel to line HF, and if there's a transversal cutting them, then corresponding angles would be equal. Let me check which lines could act as transversals. For instance, if line EF intersects both CI and HF, but wait, line EF contains point H. Wait, line HF is part of line EF? No, because line HF is mentioned separately. Wait, earlier, H lies on line EF. So line EF includes point H, so HF is a segment of line EF. Therefore, line HF is part of line EF. Therefore, since line CI is parallel to line HF, and line EF is the same line as HF, then line CI is parallel to line EF. Therefore, line CI || line EF.

Therefore, if line CI is parallel to line EF, and if there's a transversal intersecting both, say line AE or something else, then we can find some angle relations.

Additionally, since E lies on line AL, and A is on line CK and line EJ. Also, point H is on line EF and line BD. Let me try to piece together the connections.

Perhaps starting with angle 3 being ∠DHF = 110°, which is at point H. Since H is on line EF, and also on line BD and FG. Then, considering that line HF is part of line EF, which is parallel to line CI.

If line EF is parallel to line CI, then angles formed by their intersection with another line would be congruent. For example, if line AE intersects both CI and EF, then the corresponding angles would be equal. Let me check if line AE is a transversal here.

Point A is on line CI (since line CI includes point A?), Wait, line CI: point I lies on line AC (from earlier constraints: Point I lies on line AC). Wait, original constraints said:

- PointI lies on line AC.
- Point I lies on line CK (so line CK passes through I).

Also, point A lies on line CK. So line CK connects points C, K, A, and I. Therefore, points C, K, A, I are colinear in that order? Or maybe different orders. But regardless, line CI is part of line CK. Wait, line CI is a separate line? Wait, no. If point I lies on line AC, then line AC includes point I. Also, point I lies on line CK. So line CK and line AC intersect at point I? Wait, line CK passes through point I and point A. Wait, line CK passes through A (as per "Point A lies on line CK") and point I is on line CK. So line CK is the same as line AC? No, unless points A, C, K, I are colinear. Wait, line CK is defined as a line connecting points C and K. If point A lies on line CK, then A is somewhere along the line between C and K, or extended. Also, point I lies on line CK. So line CK includes points C, K, A, and I. So the line CK is a straight line with points C, then K, then A, then I, or some permutation. 

Now, since line CI is parallel to line HF. Wait, line CI is part of line CK. So line CK is parallel to line HF. Therefore, line CK || line HF. Which implies that any transversal crossing both will create corresponding angles. 

For example, if line AH crosses both CK and HF, then angles made by those intersections would be equal. Wait, but where is point H? It's on line EF, and line EF is parallel to line CI (i.e., line CK). So line EF is parallel to line CK. Therefore, line EF || line CK. Thus, any transversal crossing these two lines would form corresponding angles. 

Looking at point A, which is on line CK, and also on line EJ (since "Point A lies on line EJ"). So line EJ passes through A. So line EJ is a transversal intersecting both CK and EF (since EF is parallel to CK). Therefore, the angles formed at A and at E (where line EF meets line EJ?) may be related.

Alternatively, since line EF is parallel to line CK, and point E is on line AL. Maybe looking at triangle or other figures involving these lines.

Alternatively, let's focus on the given angles. Since angle 3 is ∠DHF = 110°, which is at point H. Since H is on line EF, and line EF is parallel to line CK. Also, since line EF is parallel to line CK, and point H is on line EF, then maybe angle at H relates to some angle on line CK. 

Alternatively, since line HF is part of line EF, and line CI is parallel to line HF (so parallel to EF), then angle at H could correspond to an angle on line CI. For example, if there's a line connecting H to some point on line CI, forming a transversal.

But maybe this is getting too abstract. Let me look for specific angle relationships that can be directly linked.

We know angle 3 is 110°, which is ∠DHF. Also, angle 12 is 55°, which is ∠FEL. Let me note that ∠FEL is at point E, between F and L. Given that E lies on line AL, so line AL passes through E. Also, line AL is connected to point L, which is connected to point E via line EL. 

Moreover, line EF is parallel to line CI. Since line EF is parallel to line CI, and line EL is part of line AL, which passes through E. Maybe triangle or transversal relationships here.

Alternatively, since ∠FEL is 55°, which is angle 12, and since line EF is parallel to line CI, then maybe there's a relationship between ∠FEL and some angle on line CI.

Wait, if line EF is parallel to line CI, then the angle ∠FEL (at point E) might be equal to an angle formed by line EL and line CI. However, without knowing where L is, it's hard to tell. But since point E lies on line AL, and line AL is connected to point L. Also, point L is connected to point E via line EL. Additionally, point L is connected to point G via line LG (since angle LEG is angle 16). 

Alternatively, maybe focusing on triangle EFG? Since angle at E is 55°, and line EF is parallel to line CI. Maybe using the fact that line EF || CI leads to some alternate interior angles or corresponding angles when crossed by another line.

Alternatively, since angle 3 is 110°, which is ∠DHF. Since H is on line EF, and line HF is part of line EF, then ∠DHF is an angle formed at H by lines HD and HF. Since H is also on line BD (as per the constraint that H lies on line BD). So line BD passes through H. Also, point I is on line BD (another constraint says point I lies on line BD). Therefore, points B, D, H, I are colinear? Wait, no. Wait, the constraints state:

- Point H lies on line BD.
- Point I lies on line BD.
Therefore, points B, D, H, I are colinear. So line BD includes points B, D, H, I. Also, point I is on line AC and line CK. So line BD passes through H and I, and line AC passes through I. 

So line BD and line AC meet at point I. Therefore, lines AC and BD intersect at point I. Also, since line CI is parallel to line HF (which is part of line EF), and line CI is part of line CK. So line CI is parallel to line EF. 

This seems complex, but maybe we can use the concept of parallel lines and transversals. Let me consider line EF (parallel to CI) and line BD passing through H and I. Since line BD passes through H and I, and line CI is parallel to line EF, maybe there's a way to relate angles around point H or I.

Alternatively, since angle 3 is ∠DHF = 110°, and H lies on BD, so line HD is part of BD. Therefore, ∠DHF is the angle between HD and HF, which is at point H. Since HF is part of line EF, which is parallel to line CI. 

If we can find some relationship between ∠DHF and angles on line CI, perhaps using the parallel lines. For example, if line HD is a transversal intersecting the parallel lines CI and EF, then the corresponding angles would be equal. Wait, but line HD is part of line BD, which passes through H and I. 

Wait, line BD passes through H and I. Since line CI is parallel to line EF, and line BD intersects both lines CI and EF at points I and H respectively. Therefore, line BD is a transversal cutting the parallel lines CI and EF at points I and H. Therefore, the angles formed at these points should be related.

Specifically, the angle between line BD and line CI at point I (which is ∠CID or something) should be equal to the angle between line BD and line EF at point H (which is ∠DHF = 110°, since that's the angle at H between HD and HF). Wait, if BD is the transversal, then the angle at I (on line CI) and angle at H (on line EF) would be corresponding angles if the lines were parallel. But since CI || EF, then yes, corresponding angles would be equal. Therefore, ∠CID (the angle between CI and BD at point I) is equal to ∠DHF (angle between EF and BD at H), which is 110°. Therefore, ∠CID = 110°.

But what is ∠CID? Well, according to the given constraints, ∠DIC equals angle 1. Wait, ∠DIC is the angle at point I between points D and C. Wait, the notation ∠DIC means vertex at I, with segments ID and IC. So ∠DIC is the angle at I between D and C. So if that angle is equal to angle 1, then angle 1 is equal to ∠DIC, which we just deduced is 110°, right? Wait, no. Wait, ∠CID is the same as ∠DIC? Wait, no. ∠DIC is angle at I between D and C. Whereas ∠CID is angle at I between C and D. Wait, no—angles are determined by three points, with the middle letter being the vertex. So ∠DIC is the angle at point I, with sides going to D and C. So that's the same as ∠CID. Wait, actually, ∠DIC and ∠CID refer to the same angle. So if line BD cuts through line CI at point I, then ∠DIC (same as ∠CID) is formed. And since line CI || EF, and BD is the transversal, then ∠DIC corresponds to ∠DHF (which is 110°), so ∠DIC = ∠DHF = 110°, hence angle 1 is 110°, since ∠DIC = angle 1. Wait, but the given equality was Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D, I, C)), MeasureOf(angle 1)). So ∠DIC equals angle 1. So angle 1 is 110°. 

But wait, angle 1 is 110°, and angle 3 is also 110°, as given. So that seems possible. Now, moving forward.

Next, angle 12 is ∠FEL = 55°, which is given. Let me think about that. Since line EF is parallel to line CI, and line EL is part of line AL (since E lies on line AL). So line AL passes through E and L. Therefore, line EL is a segment of line AL. So if we consider line AL and line EF (which is parallel to CI), then maybe there's a relationship between ∠FEL and some other angle.

Alternatively, since line EF || CI, and line AL is a transversal cutting through them. So if line AL intersects EF at point E, and line AL intersects CI at point A (since A is on line CI). Therefore, the angles formed by transversal AL with the parallel lines EF and CI would have corresponding angles. Specifically, ∠FEL (at point E between FE and EL) would correspond to ∠CAL (at point A between CA and AL). Therefore, ∠FEL = ∠CAL. Hence, ∠CAL = 55°, since ∠FEL is 55°. 

But ∠CAL is the angle at point A between points C and L. Wait, but according to the given constraints, there's an angle ∠JAC which equals angle 9. Also, there's an angle ∠CAE which equals angle 10. Let me see. 

But first, since ∠CAL is 55°, and point A is on line CK and line EJ. Wait, line EJ passes through point A. So line EJ connects E and J, passing through A. Therefore, line EJ is a straight line with points E, A, J. So ∠CAL is the angle at A between points C, A, L. Wait, but how does that relate to other angles?

Alternatively, since ∠CAL = 55°, and since point A is on line CK (line CI), so line CK passes through A. So line CA is part of line CK. Therefore, ∠CAL is the angle between CA and AL. Since line AL is connected to point L, which is connected to point E via line EL. So if ∠CAL is 55°, and since AL is connected to E, which is on line EF, which is parallel to line CI (CK). 

But maybe there's more than one way to approach this. Let's recap:

From angle 3 being 110°, we found angle 1 is 110°. From angle 12 being 55°, we inferred that ∠CAL (at point A) is 55°, which could be related to other angles.

Now, let's look at other given angles. For example, angle 10 is ∠CAE, which is the angle at A between points C, A, E. Since point E is on line AL, and line AL passes through A. So ∠CAE is the angle between CA and AE. But we just found that ∠CAL is 55°, which is the angle between CA and AL. So ∠CAE is part of ∠CAL, depending on the position of E relative to L. Wait, if E is on line AL, then line AE is part of line AL. Therefore, ∠CAE is the same as ∠CAL. Wait, that can't be unless E and L are the same point, which they aren't. So maybe my previous assumption is wrong.

Wait, ∠CAL is the angle between CA and AL. But ∠CAE is the angle between CA and AE. Since E is on line AL, then AE is a segment of AL. Therefore, ∠CAE is the same as ∠CAL. Therefore, ∠CAE = ∠CAL = 55°, so angle 10 (which is ∠CAE) is 55°. Therefore, angle 10 is 55°. 

But let me confirm. Suppose line AL passes through E and L, with A between E and L? Or is E between A and L? Depending on the configuration. But since E lies on line AL, and point A is on line EJ, which connects E and J. So if line EJ passes through A, then E and J are on opposite sides of A? Or not necessarily. But regardless, ∠CAE is formed at A between CA and AE. Since AE is part of line AL, then ∠CAE is the same as ∠CAL. Therefore, angle 10 = ∠CAE = ∠CAL = 55°, so angle 10 is 55°.

So angle 10 is 55°, angle 1 is 110°, angle 3 is 110°, angle 12 is 55°, angle 14 is unknown, angle 13 is what we need to find.

Now, let's think about other angles. For example, angle 13 is ∠KAJ, which is at point A between points K, A, J. Since point A is on line CK and line EJ. So line EJ passes through A, and line CK passes through A. So points K and J are on lines CK and EJ respectively. 

If I can find the measure of ∠KAJ, which is angle 13, perhaps by finding other angles around point A.

At point A, there are several lines: line CK (through K and I), line EJ (through E and J), line AC (since point I is on AC), line AL (since E is on AL), and line AE (part of AL). 

So at point A, angles around it could be ∠CAK, ∠KAI, ∠IAJ, etc., depending on the arrangement. But since line CK passes through A and I, and line EJ passes through A and J. So lines CK and EJ intersect at point A. Therefore, ∠KAJ is the angle between lines AK and AJ, which are parts of lines CK and EJ respectively. 

To find ∠KAJ (angle 13), perhaps we can find the sum of other angles around point A. For example, if we can find angles adjacent to ∠KAJ and sum up known values.

But first, let's recall that line CK is parallel to line EF, and line EF is parallel to line CI. Also, line CI is part of line CK. So line CK is parallel to line EF. Therefore, line EF and line CK are parallel. Also, line AL intersects line EF at E and line CK at A. So line AL is a transversal intersecting the parallel lines EF and CK. Therefore, the angles formed at E and A should be related.

Earlier, we found that ∠FEL = 55° (angle 12) corresponds to ∠CAL = 55°, which is ∠CAE (angle 10). So angle 10 is 55°, which is ∠CAE. Now, if we consider line AL intersecting the parallel lines EF and CK, then the consecutive interior angles would be supplementary. For example, ∠FEL (at E) and ∠CAE (at A) would be consecutive interior angles, so their sum would be 180°. Wait, ∠FEL is 55°, ∠CAE is 55°, which adds up to 110°, not 180°. That contradicts the idea of consecutive interior angles. Therefore, my earlier reasoning must be flawed.

Wait, maybe I confused the angles. Let me re-examine. Since line EF || line CK, and line AL is a transversal cutting both. At point E, the angle between EF and AL is ∠FEL = 55°, and at point A, the angle between CK and AL would be ∠KAL. Wait, but what is ∠KAL? 

Wait, point A is on line CK, so line CK extends from C through A to K. Therefore, line AL intersects line CK at point A. Therefore, the angle between line CK and AL at point A is ∠KAL. Since line EF || line CK, the angle between EF and AL at E (∠FEL) should be equal to the angle between CK and AL at A (∠KAL), due to corresponding angles. Therefore, ∠FEL = ∠KAL = 55°, so ∠KAL is 55°. 

But ∠KAL is the angle at point A between points K, A, L. So that's the same as ∠KAL. However, our target angle is ∠KAJ, which is the angle at point A between points K, A, J. If point J is on line EJ, then ∠KAJ depends on the position of J relative to L. 

Wait, since point A is on line EJ, and line EJ connects E and J. So line EJ passes through A. Therefore, points E, A, J are colinear. Therefore, ∠KAL is the angle between KA and LA. But LA is part of line EJ. Therefore, ∠KAL is the same as ∠KAL, but ∠KAJ is the angle between KA and JA. Since J is on line EJ, then LA and JA are the same line. Wait, no. If E is on line AL, then line AL passes through E and A. If point J is on line EJ, then line EJ is the same as line AL? No, because line AL passes through E and A, while line EJ passes through E and J. Unless J is on line AL, which isn't stated. Wait, the constraints say that point A lies on line EJ. So line EJ passes through A. So line EJ is the same as line EA extended to J. Therefore, line EJ is the same as line EA extended beyond A to J. Therefore, line EJ includes points E, A, J. Therefore, LA is part of line EJ, since E is on line AL. Wait, no. Wait, line AL passes through E and A. So line AL is the same as line EJ? Because both pass through E and A? Wait, if point A is on line EJ, then line EJ passes through A. And line AL also passes through E and A. Therefore, lines EJ and AL are the same line. Therefore, points E, A, J are colinear with A between E and J? Or not necessarily. But in any case, line EJ is the same as line AL. Therefore, ∠KAL is the angle between line KA (part of line CK) and line LA (which is line EJ). Therefore, ∠KAL = 55°, as established. 

But ∠KAJ is the angle between KA and JA. Since J is on line EJ, which is the same as line AL. So JA is part of line EJ. Therefore, ∠KAJ is the same as ∠KAL, which is 55°, unless J is positioned such that JA is in a different direction. Wait, but since line EJ passes through A and J, then JA is the extension of line EJ beyond A. So if you imagine line EJ extending from E through A to J, then ∠KAJ is the angle between KA (from K to A) and JA (from J to A). Since line EJ is straight, the angle between KA and JA is the same as ∠KAL, which is 55°, assuming that J is on the same side as E relative to A. 

Wait, but maybe there's more to it. Let me think again. If line EJ passes through A, then ∠KAJ is the angle between KA and JA. Since line EJ is straight, and J is on the line, then ∠KAJ is either the same as ∠KAL or its supplement, depending on the position of J. But since we previously found that ∠KAL = 55°, which is the angle between KA and LA. If LA is the same as EJ, then ∠KAJ is the same as ∠KAL, making angle 13 equal to 55°, which is option A. But wait, the answer choices include 55 as option A. However, let's verify this carefully.

Alternatively, maybe there's more steps needed. Let's consider that angle 13 is ∠KAJ. To find this angle, we might need to consider other angles around point A. For example, if we know other angles at point A, we can subtract them from 180° if they are linear pairs or something.

At point A, we have several lines: line CK (passing through K and I), line EJ (passing through E and J), line AC (passing through I), and line AL (same as EJ). So, angles at point A involve these lines.

We already determined that ∠KAL = 55°, which is between KA and LA. If we can find other angles at point A, we can find ∠KAJ.

For instance, suppose we consider line AC passing through point I. Since point I is on line AC and line BD, and line CI is parallel to line EF. Earlier, we found that ∠DIC = 110°, which is angle 1. Also, since line AC passes through I, and line CK is the same as line CI (wait, line CI is part of line CK. Wait, line CK passes through C, K, A, and I. So line CI is part of line CK. Therefore, line AC is part of line CK. So line AC is part of line CK. Therefore, at point A, line AC is part of line CK, which runs through A to K. So line AC is a segment from A to C, and line CK continues from A to K. So at point A, line AC and line AK are colinear, meaning they are the same line. Therefore, ∠KAC is a straight line, so it's 180°. Wait, but that might not help directly.

Alternatively, considering other angles at point A. For example, ∠JAC equals angle 9. So ∠JAC is the angle at A between points J, A, C. Since line EJ passes through A and J, and line AC is part of line CK. So ∠JAC is the angle between EJ (line AJ) and AC. 

We know that ∠KAL = 55°, which is between KA (along CK) and LA (along EJ). Also, ∠JAC is the angle between EJ (JA) and AC. Let me denote ∠JAC as angle 9. If I can express ∠KAJ in terms of ∠JAC and other known angles.

Imagine at point A, line EJ (with points E, A, J) and line CK (with points C, A, K). So the angle between line EJ (AJ) and line CK (AK) is ∠KAJ, which is what we want. This angle is composed of ∠JAC + ∠CAK? Wait, no. If line AC is part of line CK, then ∠CAK is zero? Wait, no. Let me clarify:

Line CK passes through C, A, K. So from point A, line CK extends towards C and towards K. Line EJ passes through E, A, J. So from point A, line EJ extends towards E and towards J. Therefore, the angle between line EJ (AJ) and line CK (AK) is ∠KAJ, which is formed at point A between KA and JA. 

Now, if we can find ∠JAC and ∠CAK, then maybe add or subtract them to get ∠KAJ. 

∠JAC is the angle between JA and AC. Since line AC is part of line CK, then ∠JAC is the angle between JA and AC. Also, ∠CAK is the angle between CA and AK. Since line CA is part of line CK, ∠CAK is the angle between CA and AK, which is a straight line, so ∠CAK is 180° minus something? Wait, no. If line CK passes through A, then points C, A, K are colinear. So ∠CAK is the angle at A between CA and AK, which is a straight line, so it's 18°? No, that's not right. If you're at point A, looking along CA towards C, and then turning towards K, since C and K are on the same line, the angle between CA and AK is 180°, but that's only if you're measuring the reflex angle. Normally, we take the smaller angle, which would be 0°, but that's not helpful. 

Hmm, this seems confusing. Perhaps instead, we should look at other angles around point A. 

We know that ∠KAL = 55°, which is the angle between KA (from K to A) and LA (from A to L). Since line LA is the same as line EJ (because E is on line AL and A is on line EJ), then LA is line EJ. Therefore, ∠KAL is the angle between KA and EJ. So if we can find the angle between EJ and AC, which is ∠JAC (angle 9), and since ∠KAL = 55°, then maybe ∠KAJ can be expressed as ∠KAL + ∠JAC or something similar. 

Wait, suppose ∠KAL is 55°, which is between KA and LA (EJ). If ∠JAC is the angle between LA (EJ) and AC, then ∠KAJ would be ∠KAL + ∠JAC if they are adjacent. But I need to visualize this.

At point A, line EJ (LA) and line CK (KA) form an angle of 55° (∠KAL). Line AC is part of line CK, so from point A, line AC goes towards C. So if ∠JAC is the angle between EJ (line AJ) and AC, then ∠JAC is adjacent to ∠KAL? Or is it overlapping?

Wait, line AC is part of line CK, so from point A, line AC goes towards C, which is in the opposite direction of K. So if ∠KAL is between KA (towards K) and LA (towards J), and line AC is towards C (opposite of K), then ∠JAC is the angle between LA (EJ) and AC. So if we imagine at point A, the angle between LA (EJ) and AC is ∠JAC, and the angle between AC and KA is 180°, because AC and KA are in a straight line. Wait, no. Since line CK passes through A, so from point A, line CK goes to K and to C. So line AC is part of line CK, going from A to C, and line AK goes from A to K. So the angle between AC and AK is 180°, as they are opposite directions. 

Therefore, if ∠KAL is the angle between KA and LA (55°), and ∠JAC is the angle between LA and AC, then the total angle between KA and AC would be ∠KAL + ∠JAC. But since KA and AC are opposite directions (180° apart), then ∠KAL + ∠JAC = 180°. Therefore:

∠KAL + ∠JAC = 180°  
55° + ∠JAC = 180°  
∠JAC = 180° - 55° = 125°  

So ∠JAC = 125°, which is angle 9. 

But we don't have direct info about angle 9, but maybe it's connected to other angles. However, our goal is to find angle 13, which is ∠KAJ. But ∠KAJ is the angle between KA and JA, which is the same as ∠KAL, which is 55°, unless there's something else. 

Wait, earlier I thought ∠KAJ = ∠KAL = 55°, but according to the above calculation, ∠JAC = 125°, which is angle 9. So angle 9 is 125°. Is there any relation between angle 9 and other angles? 

The given constraint says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(J, A, C)), MeasureOf(angle 9)), so ∠JAC = angle 9. So angle 9 is 125°. 

But how does this help us with angle 13? Let me think again. 

Angle 13 is ∠KAJ, which is the angle between KA and JA. Since line JA is part of line EJ, and line KA is part of line CK. Earlier, we had ∠KAL = 55°, which is between KA and LA (EJ). So ∠KAJ is the same as ∠KAL, because LA is the same as EJ. Wait, but if ∠KAL is between KA and LA (EJ), then ∠KAJ is the same as ∠KAL, since J is on line EJ. So ∠KAJ = 55°, which would make angle 13 equal to 55°, which is option A. 

However, the answer choices include 55° as option A. But before finalizing, let me check if there's any mistake in assuming that ∠KAJ equals ∠KAL. 

If line EJ passes through A and J, then ∠KAJ is the angle between KA and JA. Since ∠KAL is the angle between KA and LA (which is the same as EJ), and J is on line EJ, then ∠KAJ is indeed the same as ∠KAL. Therefore, ∠KAJ = 55°, so angle 13 is 55°, making the answer A. 

But wait, the initial given angle 12 is 55°, which is ∠FEL, and angle 13 is also 55°? That seems possible, but maybe there's a catch. Let me check for consistency.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in assuming that ∠KAL = ∠FEL. Let me revisit that. 

Line EF || line CK. Line AL is a transversal intersecting both. At point E, the angle between EF and AL is ∠FEL = 55°. At point A, the angle between CK and AL is ∠KAL. Since the lines are parallel, these angles are corresponding angles, so they should be equal. Therefore, ∠KAL = ∠FEL = 55°, confirming that ∠KAL = 55°, hence ∠KAJ = 55°. 

Thus, angle 13 is 55°, which is option A. 

But wait, the given angle 3 is 110°, angle 1 is 110°, angle 10 is 55°, angle 12 is 55°, and angle 13 is also 55°. This seems plausible. However, sometimes problems may have hidden contradictions, so I need to ensure there are no errors in the logic. 

Another way to cross-validate: suppose angle 13 is 55°, then checking if other angles fit. For example, angle 9 (JAC) is 125°, which is supplementary to 55°, as calculated earlier. Also, angle 1 is 110°, angle 3 is 110°, which matches. 

Alternatively, could there be an error in assuming that ∠KAJ = ∠KAL? What if J is on the other side of A relative to E? For example, if J is on the opposite side of A from E, then ∠KAJ would be the supplementary angle. But since the problem states that point A lies on line EJ, which means E and J are on opposite sides of A, or both on the same side. Without loss of generality, we assume standard positions, and since ∠FEL = 55° is on one side, the corresponding angle ∠KAL would be on the other side, hence ∠KAJ = 55°. 

Therefore, after careful consideration, I believe the measure of angle 13 is 55°, so the answer is A.
