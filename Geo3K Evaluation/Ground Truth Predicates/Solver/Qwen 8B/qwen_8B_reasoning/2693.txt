====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out how to find x here. So we have points A, B, and C. The problem says that the length of line AC is x, and the length of BC is y. Also, angle at A between BA and CA is 60 degrees. The length of AB is 10 units. Plus, there's a perpendicular condition: lines CA and CB are perpendicular. Wait, no—wait, it says Perpendicular(Line(C,A), Line(C,B)). So that means the lines from point C to A and from point C to B are perpendicular. So, triangle ABC has a right angle at point C? Because those two lines meet at C, so angle at C is 90 degrees?

Wait, but then we also have angle at A being 60 degrees. Let me sketch this mentally. Points A, B, C. Let me think about triangle ABC. If angle at A is 60°, and angle at C is 90°, then angle at B would be 180 - 60 - 90 = 30°. So that makes sense. So triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at C, with angle at A being 60°, making it a 30-60-90 triangle. But wait, in a standard 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in ratio 1 : √3 : 2. However, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. Wait, but here, which side is the hypotenuse?

In triangle ABC, since angle at C is 90°, then AB is the hypotenuse. So AB is opposite the right angle. Given that AB is 10 units. Then, if angle at A is 60°, then the sides adjacent to angle A would be AC (which is x) and AB is the hypotenuse. Wait, maybe I need to recall the relationships in a 30-60-90 triangle. 

In such triangles, the sides opposite 30°, 60°, and 90° are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. So if angle at A is 60°, then the side opposite angle A (which is BC) should be longer than the side adjacent. Wait, angle at A is 60°, so the side opposite angle A is BC (since in triangle ABC, angle at A is between AB and AC). Wait, let me clarify:

Let me label the triangle properly. Let me consider triangle ABC with right angle at C. Therefore, angles at A and B are acute. Angle at A is given as 60°, so angle at B is 30°. Now, in triangle ABC:

- Right angle at C.

- Angle at A: 60°, so angle at B: 30°.

So, the sides:

Opposite angle A (60°): BC = y.

Opposite angle B (30°): AC = x.

Opposite angle C (right angle): AB = 10.

In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the order:

Side opposite 30° is the shortest leg, then opposite 60°, then hypotenuse.

Therefore:

Shortest leg (opposite 30°): AC = x.

Longer leg (opposite 60°): BC = y.

Hypotenuse AB = 10.

So according to ratios:

shortest leg (x) = (hypotenuse)/2 = 10 / 2 = 5.

Then longer leg (y) = x * √3 = 5√3.

But wait, the question asks for x, which would be 5. So option A is 5. Hmm. But let me verify again because sometimes I might mix up the sides.

Alternatively, using trigonometry. In triangle ABC, right-angled at C. So tan(angle at A) = opposite/adjacent = BC / AC = y/x. Since angle at A is 60°, tan(60°) = √3 = y/x → y = x√3. Also, by Pythagoras: AC² + BC² = AB² → x² + y² = 10². Substituting y = x√3 gives x² + 3x² = 4x² = 100 → x² = 25 → x=5. So yes, x is 5. So answer is A. But let me check again if the triangle is indeed right-angled at C.

The problem states that lines CA and CB are perpendicular. That is, the lines from C to A and from C to B are perpendicular. So that implies that angle at C is 90°, so yes, triangle ABC is right-angled at C. Therefore, our previous reasoning holds. Hence, x = 5. So answer is A. But wait, the answer choices include A as 5, so that's the answer. But let me make sure I didn't misread anything. The problem says Perpendicular(Line(C,A), Line(C,B)) — meaning that lines CA and CB are perpendicular. So that's angle at C being 90°, so triangle is right-angled at C. All steps seem correct. So x = 5. So answer is A. 

But wait, another thought: Maybe the angle at A is 60°, but perhaps the triangle isn't right-angled at C? Wait, no, because the lines CA and CB are perpendicular. So vectors CA and CB are perpendicular. Therefore, angle at C is 90°. So the triangle is right-angled at C. So yes, the earlier conclusion holds. Thus, x is 5, answer A.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we begin by analyzing the given geometric constraints:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**
We are told:
- $ \text{Length}(AC) = x $
- $ \text{Length}(BC) = y $
- $ \angle BAC = 60^\circ $
- $ \text{Length}(AB) = 10 $
- $ \angle ACB = 90^\circ $, since lines $ \overline{CA} $ and $ \overline{CB} $ are perpendicular.

This forms a **right triangle** with:
- Right angle at $ C $
- Angle at $ A = 60^\circ $
- Therefore, angle at $ B = 180^\circ - 90^\circ - 60^\circ = 30^\circ $

Thus, triangle $ ABC $ is a **30–60–90 triangle**, and its sides follow the known ratio:
$$
\text{Side Opposite } 30^\circ : \text{Side Opposite } 60^\circ : \text{Hypotenuse} = 1 : \sqrt{3} : 2
$$

---

### **Step 2: Assign Sides Based on Angles**

In triangle $ ABC $:
- Side opposite $ 30^\circ $ is $ AC = x $
- Side opposite $ 60^\circ $ is $ BC = y $
- Hypotenuse $ AB = 10 $

From the 30–60–90 triangle property:
$$
\frac{x}{1} = \frac{10}{2} \Rightarrow x = 5
$$

---

### **Step 3: Conclusion**

After verifying through both geometric proportions and trigonometric analysis, we conclude that:
$$
x = 5
$$

---

### **Final Answer: A**  
$$
\boxed{\text{A}}
$$
