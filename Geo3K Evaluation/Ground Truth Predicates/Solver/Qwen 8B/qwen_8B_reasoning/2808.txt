====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, we need to find the value of x such that BE and AD are perpendicular. The given information includes some angle measures and points lying on certain lines. Let me start by visualizing the problem.

First, let me note down all the given constraints:

1. Measure of angle at point C, between points F, D (so ∠CFD) is equal to 3x.
2. Measure of angle at point F, between points B, C (so ∠BFC) is equal to 6x.
3. Measure of angle at point A, between points F, E (∠AFE) is equal to 12y - 10.
4. Point F lies on line AD.
5. Point F also lies on line BE.

So, since F is on both AD and BE, that means lines AD and BE intersect at point F. Therefore, BE and AD are two lines intersecting at F. The question says they should be perpendicular. Therefore, the angle between BE and AD at their intersection point F should be 90 degrees.

But how do these angles relate? Let me think about the diagram. Maybe I need to consider triangle relationships or use vertical angles, supplementary angles, etc.

Let me sketch a rough diagram mentally. Points A and D are connected by line AD, with F somewhere on it. Similarly, points B and E are connected by line BE, with F also on it. So, F is the intersection of AD and BE. Since they are supposed to be perpendicular, then angle AFB or angle DFE, etc., should be 90 degrees. Wait, but which specific angle?

Since BE and AD are perpendicular, the angle between them at F would be 90 degrees. So, for example, angle AFB or angle CFD (if there's a point C involved). Wait, but the given angles involve points C, F, D and B, F, C and A, F, E.

Hmm. Let me try to label the diagram as per the given angles. Let me imagine points A, B, C, D, E, F with F being the intersection of AD and BE.

Given angles:

∠CFD = 3x. That is, at point F, between points C and D. But wait, point C isn't mentioned elsewhere yet. Similarly, ∠BFC = 6x, which is at point F between B and C. And ∠AFE = 12y -10, which is at point F between A and E.

Wait, maybe there's a quadrilateral or triangles here. Let me see. If F is on AD and BE, then perhaps points A, F, D are colinear, and B, F, E are colinear.

Now, considering the angles around point F. Let me think about the sum of angles around point F. Since F is the intersection point of AD and BE, those lines form four angles at F. These angles could be vertical angles or supplementary pairs.

But we have three angles given: ∠CFD = 3x, ∠BFC = 6x, and ∠AFE = 12y -10. Also, there might be another angle related to point C and E or something else. Hmm, maybe I need to figure out relations between these angles.

Alternatively, perhaps there are triangles involving these points. For instance, triangle BFC has angle at F of 6x. Triangle CFD has angle at F of 3x. Also, triangle AFE has angle at F of 12y -10. Maybe there's more structure here.

Wait, since F is on AD and BE, then line AD passes through F, so AF + FD = AD. Similarly, BF + FE = BE. But without knowing lengths, maybe that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, maybe looking at the straight lines. For instance, since points A, F, D are colinear, then the angle along line AD at F would be a straight line, so 180 degrees. However, the angles given involve other points like C and E.

Wait, maybe there are transversal lines or parallel lines? Not sure yet. Alternatively, maybe using the fact that the sum of angles around a point is 360 degrees. Let me check that.

At point F, the angles around it would include ∠AFB, ∠BFC, ∠CFD, and ∠DFE (assuming E is connected). Wait, but depending on the configuration, maybe different angles. Let me try to think again.

If F is the intersection of AD and BE, then the lines AD and BE cross at F. Then, the angles formed at F would be:

- Between AF and BF: let's call that angle α.
- Between BF and CF: given as ∠BFC = 6x.
- Between CF and DF: given as ∠CFD = 3x.
- Between DF and EF: ?
- Between EF and AF: given as ∠AFE = 12y -10.

Wait, but maybe there's overlap here. Let me try to visualize the lines:

Assume lines AD and BE intersect at F. Let me assume that line BE goes from B through F to E, and line AD goes from A through F to D. Now, points C and E are connected? Or is there a connection to C?

Wait, the given angles involve point C. For example, ∠CFD is at F between C and D. So point C is somewhere such that FC connects to D. Similarly, ∠BFC is at F between B and C. So point C is connected to both B and D via F?

This suggests that point C is connected to both B and D through F. So maybe lines BC and DC pass through F? Or perhaps C is connected to B and D via lines passing through F. Wait, but how does that fit into the diagram?

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involving points B, F, C and another triangle involving C, F, D. Let me try to think of possible configurations.

Suppose that line BC passes through F, making ∠BFC = 6x, and line CD passes through F, making ∠CFD = 3x. Then, if lines BC and CD meet at point C, forming some triangle. But then, how does that relate to the rest of the diagram?

Alternatively, maybe there's a point C such that lines FC is connected to both B and D. Wait, but given that F is already on AD and BE, maybe C is another point connected to F?

Alternatively, maybe the diagram involves multiple lines intersecting at F. For example, lines AD, BE, and possibly others intersecting at F. Given that, the angles at F are given as part of various triangles or intersections.

Alternatively, maybe the key is to realize that angles around point F add up to 360 degrees. Let me consider that.

At point F, the total angles around it should be 360 degrees. Suppose that the angles given are parts of these angles.

We know:

- ∠BFC = 6x
- ∠CFD = 3x
- ∠AFE = 12y -10

But we need to see how these angles relate. Let me try to imagine the lines:

Starting from point F, going along BE towards B and E. From F, going along AD towards A and D. Also, lines connecting to C.

Perhaps there's a triangle BFC, with angle at F being 6x. Then, from point C, there's a line to D, creating angle CFD = 3x. So, maybe lines FC connects to both B and D. Hence, line FC is passing through F, connecting to C. Wait, but point C is a separate point. So, lines FB, FC, FD are all emanating from F? No, because F is on BE and AD. So, if there's a line FC, then point C is connected to F.

Therefore, at point F, there are several lines: FA (along AD), FB (along BE), FC (connecting to C), and FE (along BE?) Wait, no. Wait, FE is part of BE? Because BE is a line from B through F to E. So FE is a segment of BE. So, if you go from F to E, that's along BE.

Similarly, from F to A is along AD. From F to D is along AD. So, line AD passes through F, and line BE passes through F. Additionally, there's a line FC connecting to point C. So, at point F, there are lines: FA, FD (along AD); FB, FE (along BE); and FC (to point C).

Thus, the angles at F would be between these lines. So, for example, angle between FB and FC is ∠BFC = 6x; angle between FC and FD is ∠CFD = 3x; angle between FD and FE is... Well, FD is part of AD, FE is part of BE. What's the angle between FD and FE? That would depend on the configuration. Also, angle between FE and FA? Which is given as ∠AFE = 12y -10.

But since AD and BE are perpendicular, the angle between AD and BE at F is 90 degrees. So, the angle between lines AD and BE at F is 90 degrees. How does this relate to the other angles?

The angle between AD and BE at F can be considered as the angle between lines AD and BE. Since AD is line AF-D and BE is line BF-E. So, the angle between them would be either ∠AFB or its vertical angle.

But since AD and BE are perpendicular, ∠AFB = 90 degrees.

Wait, but how do we express ∠AFB in terms of the given angles?

Looking at the angles around point F. Let me try to list all angles around F:

From the lines FA, FB, FC, FD, FE.

Assuming the order of the lines around F is important. Let me suppose that starting from line FA (part of AD), going clockwise, we have FE (part of BE), then FC, then FD, then back to FA? Not sure. It depends on the exact arrangement, but maybe we can consider that.

Alternatively, let me consider that the lines at F are:

- AD: passing through F, so directions from F to A and F to D.

- BE: passing through F, so directions from F to B and F to E.

- FC: direction from F to C.

So, the angles between these lines would involve combinations of these directions.

But without knowing the exact positions of C, it's challenging. However, given that angles involving C are given: ∠CFD = 3x and ∠BFC = 6x.

So, ∠BFC is the angle between FB and FC, which is 6x. ∠CFD is the angle between FC and FD, which is 3x. So, combining these, the angle between FB and FD would be ∠BFC + ∠CFD = 6x + 3x = 9x. But FB and FD are two lines from F: FB is part of BE, FD is part of AD. Therefore, the angle between BE and AD at F is 9x. But we were told that BE and AD are perpendicular, so this angle must be 90 degrees. Therefore:

9x = 90° → x = 10°.

Wait, that seems straightforward. Is that correct?

Let me verify. If the angle between BE and AD at F is ∠BFD, which is composed of ∠BFC + ∠CFD = 6x + 3x = 9x. Since BE and AD are perpendicular, this angle must be 90°, so 9x = 90 ⇒ x=10. So, answer is B. But let me make sure there are no errors in reasoning.

Wait, but why is ∠BFD equal to the angle between BE and AD? Because BE is the line containing FB and FE, and AD is the line containing FD and FA. So, the angle between BE and AD at F is indeed the angle between FB and FD, assuming that the lines BE and AD are crossing at F. Therefore, yes, the angle between BE and AD is ∠BFD, which equals 6x + 3x = 9x. Setting that equal to 90° gives x=10. So answer is B, option B.

But wait, what about the third angle given, ∠AFE = 12y -10? Why wasn't that used? Maybe there's more to the problem? Did I miss something?

Ah! The problem states that we need to find x so that BE and AD are perpendicular. However, there is another angle given: ∠AFE = 12y -10. This suggests that there might be another relationship involving y. But why hasn't that been used yet?

Wait, maybe there's a missing constraint. Perhaps there's a relation between x and y due to other angles? For example, if there's a triangle or another angle relationship that links y with x?

Let me check. If my previous conclusion was based only on the angles involving C, but the presence of ∠AFE suggests there might be more constraints. However, the problem didn't mention anything else. Wait, the question says "find x so that BE and AD are perpendicular". So, perhaps even though there is another angle given, maybe that equation ∠AFE = ... is just additional info, but not necessary for solving for x? Or maybe there's a miscalculation here?

Wait, let me think again. Suppose that there is another angle at point F involving y. For example, if ∠AFE is adjacent to other angles. Let me consider the full circle around point F.

Earlier, I thought that the angle between BE and AD is 9x, which equals 90 degrees. But what about the remaining angles around point F?

Around point F, the total is 360 degrees. We have:

- ∠BFC = 6x
- ∠CFD = 3x
- ∠AFE = 12y -10
- And maybe other angles?

Wait, if I consider the angles around F:

Assuming the lines are arranged such that from point F, the lines are: FB, FC, FD, FE, FA. Depending on the order, the angles between each pair.

But earlier, I assumed that the angle between BE and AD is ∠BFD = 6x + 3x = 9x. However, there's also the angle ∠AFE given. Let me think about that.

Angle AFE is at point F, between points A, F, E. So, that's the angle between FA and FE. Since FE is part of BE, and FA is part of AD. Therefore, ∠AFE is the same as the angle between AD and BE at F, right? Wait, but earlier I said that the angle between AD and BE is 9x. So if ∠AFE is the same as that angle, then:

12y -10 = 9x.

But earlier, I had 9x = 90°, leading to x=10. Then substituting x=10 into 12y -10 = 9*10 = 90, so 12y -10 = 90 → 12y = 100 → y = 100/12 ≈ 8.333...

But the problem didn't specify any conditions on y, so maybe there's inconsistency here? Or perhaps my assumption that ∠AFE equals the angle between AD and BE is wrong?

Wait, let me clarify. The angle between AD and BE at point F is determined by the angle between lines AD and BE. Since AD contains FA and FD, and BE contains FE and FB. The angle between AD and BE at F can be either ∠AFB or ∠DFE, depending on which side you take. However, ∠AFE is the angle between FA and FE. Since FE is part of BE, and FA is part of AD, then ∠AFE is indeed the angle between AD and BE at F. Thus, that angle should be equal to the angle between AD and BE, which is 9x (from before). But according to the given, that angle is also equal to 12y -10. So:

9x = 12y -10.

But we also have from the perpendicular condition that 9x = 90°, hence x = 10. Substituting x=10 into 9x = 12y -10:

9*10 = 12y -10 → 90 = 12y -10 → 12y = 100 → y = 100 / 12 ≈ 8.333.

But the problem didn't give us any other equations involving y, so this seems okay. However, since the problem asks only for x, and we derived x=10 from the perpendicularity condition, regardless of y. Hence, even though there's another equation involving y, since we don't have more information, we can still determine x=10.

But wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Because if ∠AFE is the angle between AD and BE, which we've set to 9x, but also to 12y -10. However, if there's another way to compute that angle, maybe we can get another equation?

Alternatively, maybe there's an error in assuming that ∠AFE equals the angle between AD and BE. Let me re-examine that.

∠AFE is at point F, between points A-F-E. So, FA is part of AD, and FE is part of BE. So, the angle between AD and BE at F is indeed ∠AFE. Therefore, ∠AFE = angle between AD and BE = 9x. Therefore, setting that equal to 12y -10. But unless there's another condition, we can't find y. However, since the problem doesn't give any other constraints, perhaps y is arbitrary, and our solution for x is independent of y. Therefore, x=10 is acceptable.

Hence, the answer should be B. But let me double-check.

Another possibility: Could the angle between AD and BE be something else? Like, if there are two angles at F, one being 9x and another being 12y -10, adding up to 180 degrees or something?

Wait, when two lines intersect, they form two pairs of opposite angles. So, the angle between AD and BE at F is either ∠AFE or its vertical angle. But also, the other angle would be supplementary to it if they are linear pairs. Wait, but in this case, if AD and BE intersect at F, then the angles around F would consist of two pairs of vertical angles. One pair would be the acute angles (like ∠AFE and its vertical angle), and the obtuse ones. However, since AD and BE are perpendicular, all four angles at F would be right angles. Wait, but that contradicts the given angles unless all those angles are 90 degrees. 

Wait, this suggests that my earlier assumption that ∠AFE equals 9x is incorrect. Because if AD and BE are perpendicular, then all angles at F should be 90 degrees. But according to the given, ∠BFC = 6x and ∠CFD = 3x. So, if those are parts of the angles around F, then their sum plus other angles must equal 360 degrees.

Wait, this is conflicting with the previous conclusion. Let me redo this analysis carefully.

Let me consider that at point F, the lines AD and BE intersect, forming four angles. Let me denote them as follows:

Let’s say the angle between BE and AD at F is θ. Since they are perpendicular, θ = 90 degrees.

Additionally, there are lines FC, creating other angles. Specifically, we have ∠BFC = 6x and ∠CFD = 3x. These angles are adjacent, forming the angle between BE and AD (θ). Wait, if ∠BFC and ∠CFD are adjacent, then together they make up the angle between BE and AD?

Wait, let's imagine that line FC splits the angle between BE and AD. So, if we have line FC going from F to point C, then it creates two angles: ∠BFC and ∠CFD. So, those two angles are adjacent and their sum is the angle between BE and AD. Hence:

∠BFC + ∠CFD = angle between BE and AD = θ = 90 degrees.

Therefore:

6x + 3x = 90 → 9x = 90 → x = 10. 

This makes sense. So, this approach leads to x=10, which matches the earlier conclusion. And the angle ∠AFE is another angle at F. Where is ∠AFE located?

∠AFE is at point F, between A, F, E. Since A is on AD and E is on BE. So, ∠AFE is the angle between FA (which is along AD) and FE (which is along BE). Therefore, ∠AFE is the same as the angle between AD and BE, which is θ = 90 degrees. Hence, ∠AFE = 90 degrees. But according to the given, ∠AFE = 12y -10. Therefore:

12y -10 = 90 → 12y = 100 → y = 100/12 ≈ 8.333.

But since the problem didn't ask for y, this is just extra information, and we don't need it to solve for x. So, x=10 is the answer.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Option B is 10.

I think this is solid. Earlier confusion about the angle ∠AFE was resolved by recognizing that it is the same as the angle between AD and BE, which is given to be 90 degrees. Hence, equating that to 12y -10 allows finding y, but since we only needed x, and we got x=10 from the sum of the other two angles, that's sufficient.

Thus, Final Answer: B.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $ such that lines $ \overline{AD} $ and $ \overline{BE} $ are **perpendicular**, we begin by analyzing the given geometric constraints and applying fundamental principles of angle relationships.

---

### Step 1: Understanding the Diagram

We are told:

- $ \angle CFD = 3x $
- $ \angle BFC = 6x $
- $ \angle AFE = 12y - 10 $
- $ F $ lies on both $ \overline{AD} $ and $ \overline{BE} $

This implies that lines $ \overline{AD} $ and $ \overline{BE} $ intersect at point $ F $. The goal is to ensure that these lines are **perpendicular** — i.e., the angle between them at point $ F $ is $ 90^\circ $.

---

### Step 2: Analyzing the Angles Around Point $ F $

At point $ F $, the lines $ \overline{AD} $ and $ \overline{BE} $ intersect, and we are given two angles involving a third line $ \overline{FC} $:

- $ \angle BFC = 6x $: Angle between segments $ \overline{FB} $ and $ \overline{FC} $
- $ \angle CFD = 3x $: Angle between segments $ \overline{FC} $ and $ \overline{FD} $

These two angles lie on the same side of $ \overline{FC} $, meaning they are **adjacent** and form a larger angle at point $ F $, specifically:

$$
\angle BFD = \angle BFC + \angle CFD = 6x + 3x = 9x
$$

This angle $ \angle BFD $ corresponds to the angle between lines $ \overline{AD} $ and $ \overline{BE} $ at point $ F $.

---

### Step 3: Using Perpendicular Condition

Since the lines $ \overline{AD} $ and $ \overline{BE} $ are **perpendicular**, the angle between them at point $ F $ must be:

$$
\angle BFD = 90^\circ
$$

Substitute the expression we found earlier:

$$
9x = 90 \Rightarrow x = 10
$$

---

### Step 4: Confirming Consistency with Other Given Information

We are also given that:

$$
\angle AFE = 12y - 10
$$

This angle is the angle between segments $ \overline{FA} $ and $ \overline{FE} $, which are parts of lines $ \overline{AD} $ and $ \overline{BE} $ respectively. Therefore, this angle is **equal** to the angle between $ \overline{AD} $ and $ \overline{BE} $, which is $ 90^\circ $.

So,

$$
12y - 10 = 90 \Rightarrow 12y = 100 \Rightarrow y = \frac{100}{12}
$$

However, this value of $ y $ is not needed to solve for $ x $, as the perpendicularity condition alone determines $ x $.

---

### Final Conclusion

By examining the sum of adjacent angles at point $ F $, we deduced that the angle between lines $ \overline{AD} $ and $ \overline{BE} $ is $ 9x $, and since they are perpendicular, this must be $ 90^\circ $. Solving $ 9x = 90 $ yields:

$$
x = 10
$$

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\text{B}}
$$
