MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have some angles given with variables, and we need to find the measure of angle R. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, the problem mentions several angles with specific measures. The notation like Angle(S, T, Q) probably refers to the angle at point T between points S and Q. Wait, in standard notation, Angle(A, B, C) would mean the angle at point B formed by points A, B, C. So, for example, Angle(S, T, Q) is the angle at T between S and Q. Similarly for the others.

So, let's note down each given angle:

1. Measure of Angle(S, T, Q) = x. That's angle at T between S and Q. So ∠STQ = x.

Wait, but maybe I should draw a diagram mentally. Let me think about how these points are arranged. Since there are points S, T, Q, R mentioned, perhaps they form a quadrilateral? Or maybe a triangle with some extended lines?

Alternatively, maybe it's a pentagon? But without more information, it's hard to tell. However, since there are four angles given involving points S, T, Q, R, maybe they form a polygon or intersecting lines.

But let's see. Let me list all the given angles again:

- ∠STQ = x (Angle(S, T, Q))
- ∠TQR = 2x + 5 (Angle(T, Q, R)) – wait, no: the second one is Angle(T, Q, R). So that's angle at Q between T and R. So ∠TQR = 2x + 5?
Wait, no. Wait, Angle(T, Q, R) would be angle at Q between T and R. So yes, ∠TQR = 2x + 5.

Third angle: ∠RST = 2x + 7 (Angle(R, S, T)). So angle at S between R and T. So ∠RST = 2x + 7.

Fourth angle: ∠QRS = x (Angle(Q, R, S)). That's angle at R between Q and S. So ∠QRS = x.

Wait, so let me write them again:

Given:

1. ∠STQ = x (at T)
2. ∠TQR = 2x + 5 (at Q)
3. ∠RST = 2x + 7 (at S)
4. ∠QRS = x (at R)

Hmm. Now, the question is asking for m∠R. Which angle at R? Because there's ∠QRS which is at R. Wait, ∠QRS is the angle at R between Q and S. So that's one angle at R. But maybe there's another angle at R? Or perhaps the total angle at R?

Wait, depending on how the points are connected. Maybe points S, T, Q, R form a quadrilateral? Let me try to imagine.

Let me assume that points S, T, Q, R form a quadrilateral. Let me consider possible connections. For instance, suppose we have quadrilateral STQR? Or maybe triangle STR with a point Q somewhere?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a triangle involved. Wait, if we have points S, T, Q, R, maybe they form two triangles sharing a common side. For example, triangle SQT and triangle QRT?

Alternatively, maybe the points are arranged such that S-T-Q-R-S forms a polygon. Let me think. If I can figure out the configuration, then I can apply the sum of angles or other theorems.

Alternatively, maybe the points are part of a triangle with some transversal lines. Let me try to think.

Looking at the angles given:

At point T: ∠STQ = x. At point Q: ∠TQR = 2x + 5. At point S: ∠RST = 2x + 7. At point R: ∠QRS = x. 

Wait, perhaps these angles are parts of triangles. Let me check if there are triangles here. For example, triangle SQT has angles at S, T, Q. Wait, but ∠STQ is at T. Then, if we look at triangle SQT, its angles would be at S, T, Q. So maybe ∠SQT is something else? Wait, but we don't know that yet.

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle QRS? Let me think.

Wait, if I consider triangle QRS, then the angles at Q, R, S would be... Well, ∠QRS is at R, which is given as x. What about the other angles? Hmm, unless there's more info.

Alternatively, maybe looking at triangle TRS? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle with vertices S, T, R? Let me think.

Alternatively, since multiple angles are given around different points, perhaps the key is to use the fact that the sum of angles around a point is 360 degrees, or the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, or maybe supplementary angles.

Wait, let me consider the possibility that points S, T, Q, R lie on a straight line or form certain polygons. Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle with an external point.

Alternatively, perhaps the points form a star shape or something else.

Wait, let me try to think of this as a quadrilateral. Suppose S, T, Q, R form a quadrilateral. Then the sum of interior angles would be (4-2)*180=360 degrees. But do we have enough angles?

If that's the case, then the angles at each vertex would be:

At S: ?

At T: ?

At Q: ?

At R: ?

But according to the given angles:

We have ∠STQ (which is at T), ∠TQR (at Q), ∠RST (at S), and ∠QRS (at R). Wait, but those are not necessarily the entire angles at each vertex. For example, ∠STQ is an internal angle at T if the quadrilateral is STQR. But maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the figure is a pentagon? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps there are two triangles connected at a common side. For example, triangle SQT and triangle QTR? Or something like that.

Wait, let me think again. Let's take each angle and see which triangle they belong to.

Starting with ∠STQ = x. This angle is at point T, between points S and Q. So that suggests that points S, T, Q are connected, forming triangle STQ. Then, if we have another angle at Q, ∠TQR = 2x + 5. So that angle is at Q, between T and R. Therefore, point R is connected to Q, making triangle TQR?

Similarly, ∠RST = 2x + 7 is at point S, between R and T. So that implies that point R is connected to S, forming triangle RST. And finally, ∠QRS = x is at point R, between Q and S. So that suggests that points Q, R, S are connected, forming triangle QRS.

Putting all together, perhaps the figure consists of points S, T, Q, R connected in such a way that there are triangles STQ, TQR, RST, and QRS. Maybe overlapping triangles?

Alternatively, maybe the points form a quadrilateral with diagonals. For example, quadrilateral S, T, Q, R with diagonals SQ and RT intersecting? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a triangle with a point inside? For example, suppose we have triangle SQR, and point T somewhere inside. But then angles at T might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe the points are arranged such that there is a triangle STR with point Q on one side.

This seems too vague. Maybe I need to find relationships between the angles using triangle angle sums or other properties.

Let me consider that there might be multiple triangles here. Let me look for triangles where I can apply the angle sum theorem.

For example, triangle STQ: if we can find all three angles, their sum is 180 degrees. We know one angle at T: ∠STQ = x. What about the other angles?

The other angles would be at S and Q. But do we know anything about them? Let's see.

Wait, ∠RST is given as 2x + 7. That's the angle at S between R and T. So if we consider triangle RST, then angle at S is ∠RST = 2x + 7, angle at T is something, and angle at R is something else. But how does that relate to triangle STQ?

Alternatively, maybe triangle SQT and triangle SRT share side QT?

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to approach differently.

Since there are angles given at various points, maybe I can set up equations based on the assumption that certain lines are straight, leading to supplementary angles or something similar.

Another thought: if points S, T, Q, R are connected in such a way that they form a polygon, maybe a quadrilateral, then the sum of the interior angles could help. But earlier, I wasn't sure if they form a quadrilateral.

Alternatively, let me focus on the angles given:

We have angles at T, Q, S, and R. Let me consider that maybe these angles are part of different triangles, and perhaps the sum of angles around a point equals 360 degrees.

Wait, for example, at point Q: there is ∠TQR = 2x + 5, and also ∠SQT (if that exists). Wait, if we consider the angles at point Q, maybe they add up to something. Similarly for other points.

Alternatively, maybe the points form a triangle with a transversal. For example, suppose there is a triangle with vertices S, T, R, and point Q lying somewhere on one of the sides or extending from it.

Let me try assuming that. Let's say we have triangle SRT, and point Q is somewhere along one of the sides.

Suppose Q lies on side SR. Then, for instance, ∠STQ would be an angle formed by connecting T to Q. But this is just speculation.

Alternatively, if Q is outside the triangle. This is too vague. Maybe I need to think algebraically.

Let me try to consider the angles given and see if I can find relations between them.

From the given angles:

At point T: ∠STQ = x.

At point Q: ∠TQR = 2x + 5.

At point S: ∠RST = 2x + 7.

At point R: ∠QRS = x.

Now, if I can find a relationship between these angles, maybe through triangles or straight lines.

Let me think about triangle QRS. In triangle QRS, we know one angle at R is x (∠QRS = x). What about the other angles? The other angles would be at Q and S. Are they related to the given angles?

Wait, ∠TQR is at point Q, between T and R. So if Q is connected to R and T, then ∠TQR is part of triangle TQR. Also, ∠QRS is at R between Q and S. So if we consider triangle QRS, then ∠QRS = x, and maybe ∠QSR (at S) is related to ∠RST?

Wait, ∠RST is the angle at S between R and T. If we consider triangle RST, then ∠RST = 2x + 7 is one of its angles. Also, if there is a connection between triangle RST and triangle QRS.

Alternatively, maybe there are vertical angles or something else.

Alternatively, think about the straight line. For example, if points S, T, Q are colinear, but that may not be the case.

Alternatively, maybe considering that the sum of angles around a point equals 360 degrees. For instance, at point T, if there are multiple angles meeting there.

But without knowing the exact configuration, this is challenging.

Wait, maybe focusing on triangle STQ. In triangle STQ, the angles are at S, T, Q. We know ∠STQ = x (at T). What about the other angles?

At point S: If we consider triangle STQ, the angle at S would be ∠TSQ. Is that related to any other given angle?

Yes! The angle ∠RST is given as 2x + 7. That's the angle at S between R and T. So if we consider that ∠RST is adjacent to ∠TSQ, perhaps they form a linear pair or something else.

Wait, if point R is connected to S and T, then ∠RST is part of triangle RST, while ∠TSQ is part of triangle STQ. Depending on the position of R relative to S and T, these angles could be adjacent or not.

Assuming that R is positioned such that lines RS and RT exist. Wait, maybe there's a triangle RST where ∠RST is given as 2x + 7, and another triangle STQ.

Alternatively, think of point Q being connected to both T and R. So, maybe Q is a point connected to T and R, making lines TQ and QR.

Let me try to outline this:

Imagine triangle SRT. Point Q is connected to T and R. So, lines TQ and RQ connect to Q. Thus, creating triangles SQT and QRT.

In this scenario, at point T, we have angle ∠STQ = x. At point Q, we have ∠TQR = 2x + 5. At point S, we have ∠RST = 2x + 7. At point R, we have ∠QRS = x.

Also, since Q is connected to both T and R, maybe there are other angles at Q. For example, at point Q, we have angles ∠TQS and ∠TQR, which might add up to something.

Wait, if we consider that at point Q, the angles around it could sum up to 360 degrees if there are multiple lines emanating from Q. But if there are only two lines from Q (to T and to R), then the angle between them is ∠TQR = 2x + 5, and possibly other angles if there are more lines.

But given that there's also ∠SQT, which is part of triangle STQ. Wait, ∠SQT is the angle at Q between S and T. So, if we consider that, then at point Q, there are two angles: ∠SQT (from triangle STQ) and ∠TQR (given as 2x + 5). These two angles might form a larger angle or be adjacent.

Wait, if lines QS and QT are connected to Q, then ∠SQT is the angle between QS and QT. If there's also a line QR from Q to R, then ∠TQR is the angle between QT and QR. So, the total angle at Q would be ∠SQT + ∠TQR if QS, QT, QR are in order around Q. So, if that's the case, then ∠SQT + ∠TQR = angle between QS and QR.

But unless there's more information, I can't assume that. However, if we assume that the points are arranged such that Q is connected to S, T, and R, then the angles at Q would depend on the configuration.

But maybe there's another way. Let me consider triangle SQT and triangle QRT.

In triangle SQT, angles are at S, T, Q. We know ∠STQ = x (at T). Let's denote ∠SQT as y. Then, the third angle at S would be ∠QST = z. So, x + y + z = 180°.

But we also have ∠RST = 2x + 7, which is the angle at S between R and T. If ∠QST is part of that, then maybe ∠QST + ∠RST = something? Like if R is on the extension of QS or something.

Wait, suppose that point R is on the same line as QS extended beyond S. Then, ∠RST would be a straight line, but that might not fit. Alternatively, if R is connected to S, making triangle RST.

Alternatively, let me think of triangle RST. In triangle RST, we know ∠RST = 2x + 7 (at S), and we might need to find other angles. If we can relate this to other triangles.

Additionally, at point R, we have ∠QRS = x. So, in triangle QRS, we have angle at R is x. If we can find other angles in triangle QRS, that might help.

But I'm stuck because without knowing the configuration, it's difficult to proceed. Maybe I need to make assumptions based on typical problems.

Wait, perhaps the key is to realize that the sum of angles around point Q or point S or T gives us equations.

Let me try considering point Q. At point Q, we have two angles: ∠TQR = 2x + 5 (between T and R) and ∠SQT (which is part of triangle SQT). Assuming that these two angles are adjacent and form a larger angle, or maybe they are part of a straight line.

But unless we have more info, I cannot assume that. However, if we consider that Q is connected to S, T, and R, then the angles at Q would be ∠SQT, ∠TQR, and maybe others if there are more lines. But without knowing, it's tricky.

Alternatively, think of the whole figure as a quadrilateral with vertices S, T, R, Q. Let me assume that. So quadrilateral STQR. Then, the sum of its interior angles is 360 degrees. Let me check if I can express each angle in terms of x.

But which angles are given?

In quadrilateral STQR:

- At vertex T: angle is ∠STQ = x (assuming that the interior angle at T is x).
- At vertex Q: angle is ∠TQR = 2x + 5 (interior angle at Q).
- At vertex R: angle is ∠QRS = x (interior angle at R).
- At vertex S: angle is ... ? It depends on the other angles. The angle at S would be ∠RST = 2x + 7? Wait, no. The interior angle at S in quadrilateral STQR would be the angle between sides S-T and S-R. But ∠RST is the angle at S between R and T, which is indeed the interior angle at S. So, that would be 2x + 7.

So, if that's the case, then the sum of the interior angles would be x + (2x + 5) + x + (2x + 7) = ?

Calculating:

x + 2x + 5 + x + 2x + 7 = (x + 2x + x + 2x) + (5 + 7) = 6x + 12.

And since the sum of interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360°, then:

6x + 12 = 360

Solving for x:

6x = 360 - 12 = 348

x = 348 / 6 = 58

Then, x = 58 degrees.

But the question asks for m∠R. In our assumption, the interior angle at R is ∠QRS = x = 58°, which would be option A. But let me check if this makes sense.

Wait, but hold on. If the quadrilateral is STQR, then the interior angle at R is ∠QRS, which is given as x. So according to this calculation, x = 58°, hence ∠R = 58°, which would be answer A. However, the answer choices include 58 as option A. But I need to verify if my assumption that the quadrilateral's interior angles are those given is valid.

Wait, let me double-check. In quadrilateral STQR, the interior angles are:

At S: ∠RST = 2x + 7

At T: ∠STQ = x

At Q: ∠TQR = 2x + 5

At R: ∠QRS = x

Adding up: 2x+7 + x + 2x+5 + x = 6x + 12 = 360 => x=58.

Therefore, the measure of angle at R is x = 58°, so answer A.

But wait, the answer choices have option A as 58. However, sometimes in geometry problems, especially when dealing with triangles or other figures, the angle you're supposed to find might not be the interior angle directly. Let me confirm.

But the question says "Find m∠R." Given that ∠QRS is at R, and we've assumed that's the interior angle of the quadrilateral. Unless there's something wrong with this assumption.

But why did I assume that the interior angles are those given? Let me re-examine the notation.

Angle(S, T, Q) is the angle at T between S and Q, which in the quadrilateral STQR would be the interior angle at T. Similarly, Angle(T, Q, R) is the angle at Q between T and R, which would be the interior angle at Q. Angle(R, S, T) is the angle at S between R and T, which is the interior angle at S. Angle(Q, R, S) is the angle at R between Q and S, which is the interior angle at R. Hence, my initial assumption was correct.

Thus, solving gives x = 58°, so m∠R = x = 58°, which corresponds to option A. But let me check if there's a mistake here.

Wait, but let me think again: the problem didn't specify that the points form a quadrilateral, so is there a possibility that the figure isn't a quadrilateral? For example, if there are intersecting lines or something else, then the angle sum might not be 360 degrees. But given that the problem provides four angles, and the answer comes out cleanly, it's likely that the intended solution assumes a quadrilateral.

However, let me check with another approach to ensure correctness.

Alternative approach: Assume that the points form a triangle with an extra point.

Suppose we have triangle SRT, and point Q is somewhere such that lines TQ and RQ are drawn. Then, in this case, there could be multiple triangles.

Let me consider triangle SRT. The angles at S, T, R would be:

At S: ∠RST = 2x + 7.

At T: ∠STQ = x? No, ∠STQ is part of triangle STQ, not necessarily the angle of triangle SRT.

Wait, but if Q is inside triangle SRT, then ∠STQ would be an angle inside the triangle. But without knowing the exact position of Q, it's still unclear.

Alternatively, if Q is outside the triangle, forming another triangle.

Alternatively, think about triangle TQR. In triangle TQR, we know ∠TQR = 2x + 5. If we can find other angles in this triangle.

But again, without more information, this is tough.

However, the previous method gave a consistent answer assuming a quadrilateral, and the math checks out. Let me see if plugging x=58 into the angles makes sense.

With x=58:

- ∠STQ = 58°
- ∠TQR = 2*58 +5 = 121°
- ∠RST = 2*58 +7 = 123°
- ∠QRS = 58°

Sum of interior angles of quadrilateral: 58 + 121 + 58 + 123 = let's compute:

58 + 121 = 179; 58 + 123 = 181; total is 179 + 181 = 360°, which matches. So this is correct.

Hence, the measure of angle at R, which is ∠QRS = x = 58°, so answer A.

But wait, the answer choices include A.58, B.60, etc. However, sometimes in such problems, the angle asked might not be the interior angle. For example, if the figure is not convex, or if there are reflex angles. But in most cases, especially with given answers, it's safe to assume convexity.

But let me check once more. The question says "Find m∠R". The notation ∠QRS means the angle at R between Q and S, which in the quadrilateral is the interior angle. Hence, it's 58°, answer A.

But let me check the answer choices again:

A. 58

B. 60

C. 122

D. 124

So, A is 58. But maybe I made a wrong assumption?

Wait, another thought: maybe the given angles are not the interior angles of the quadrilateral. For example, ∠STQ is an exterior angle or something else.

Wait, if ∠STQ is an angle in triangle STQ, then depending on where Q is located, it might be an interior or exterior angle of the quadrilateral.

But if the points form a quadrilateral, then the angle at T (∠STQ) would be an interior angle. So my previous reasoning holds.

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involved where ∠RST is an exterior angle. For example, in triangle SRT, ∠RST could be an exterior angle. But without knowing the full context, it's hard to say.

But given that the sum of the angles in the quadrilateral works perfectly, and leads to a clean answer, I think the correct answer is A. However, sometimes problems might trick you by having the angle you're supposed to find not directly given.

Wait, but the question specifically asks for m∠R. Which in our case is ∠QRS = x, which we found as 58°. So answer A.

But let me check again if there's a possibility that the actual angle at R is different. For example, if the figure includes a triangle where ∠R is part of a larger angle.

Wait, suppose that the figure is not a quadrilateral but instead a pentagon or something else, but then we wouldn't have enough information. Alternatively, maybe the points form a triangle with Q inside it, leading to different angle relations.

But in that case, without additional info, it's impossible to calculate. Hence, the safest assumption is the quadrilateral, giving answer A.

But let me check if there's another way someone might get a different answer.

Another approach: Consider triangle QRS. We know ∠QRS = x, and if we can find other angles in this triangle.

But to do that, we'd need more information. For instance, if we knew another angle in triangle QRS, we could find x. But how?

If we can relate it to other angles. For example, maybe ∠QSR is related to ∠RST.

∠RST is given as 2x + 7. If ∠QSR is part of that angle, then maybe ∠QSR + something = ∠RST.

But unless we know how Q is positioned relative to S and T, it's unclear.

Alternatively, if lines QS and RT intersect at point Q, forming vertical angles or something.

But again, without a clear diagram, this is speculative.

Given that the quadrilateral assumption gives a consistent answer and fits all given angles, I will stick with that.

Final Answer: A

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ m\angle R $, we begin by interpreting the given angular expressions and identifying the geometric structure implied by the relationships among the points. The key is recognizing that the configuration described involves **a quadrilateral**—specifically, **quadrilateral $ STQR $**—where each angle is defined by the intersection of segments originating from each vertex.

---

### Step 1: Assign Known Angles

Based on the notation used:

- $ \angle STQ = x $
- $ \angle TQR = 2x + 5 $
- $ \angle RST = 2x + 7 $
- $ \angle QRS = x $

These represent the **interior angles** at each vertex of the quadrilateral $ STQR $, interpreted in the standard way that $ \angle ABC $ denotes the angle at vertex $ B $. Thus, the four interior angles of quadrilateral $ STQR $ are:

- At $ T $: $ x $
- At $ Q $: $ 2x + 5 $
- At $ S $: $ 2x + 7 $
- At $ R $: $ x $

---

### Step 2: Use Sum of Interior Angles of Quadrilaterals

The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is always:

$$
360^\circ
$$

So, adding up the known angles:

$$
x + (2x + 5) + (2x + 7) + x = 6x + 12
$$

Set this equal to 360°:

$$
6x + 12 = 360
$$

Subtract 12 from both sides:

$$
6x = 348
$$

Divide both sides by 6:

$$
x = 58
$$

---

### Step 3: Determine $ m\angle R $

Recall that $ \angle QRS = x $, and since $ x = 58^\circ $, we conclude that:

$$
m\angle R = 58^\circ
$$

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{\text{A}}
$$
