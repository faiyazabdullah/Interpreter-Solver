MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, the question is asking for the measure of angle RST, given that angle at T (which I think is angle RTS?) is 70 degrees, and the lengths of TR and SR are equal. Wait, let me parse the problem again carefully.

The problem says:

Given:
- Measure of Angle(T, R, S) is 70 degrees. Hmm, so Angle(T, R, S) would be the angle at point R between points T and S. Wait, no. In standard notation, Angle(A, B, C) refers to the angle at point B between points A and C. So, Angle(T, R, S) is the angle at point R formed by points T, R, S. So that's angle TRS. So, ∠TRS = 70°.

Then it says that the length of line TR equals the length of line SR. So, TR = SR. Wait, TR is from T to R, and SR is from S to R? Wait, maybe I need to draw a diagram mentally.

Let me visualize triangle TRS. Let me consider points T, R, S. The angle at R is 70 degrees. Also, TR and SR are two sides meeting at R. But wait, if TR and SR are equal in length, then triangle TRS has two sides equal: TR and SR. Therefore, triangle TRS is isosceles with TR = SR. Therefore, the base angles would be equal. Wait, but which angles?

In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are equal. Here, TR and SR are equal. So, sides TR and SR are equal. So, side TR is opposite angle S, and side SR is opposite angle T. Wait, no. Wait, in triangle TRS, each side is opposite the corresponding angle. So:

- Side TR is opposite angle S.
- Side SR is opposite angle T.
Wait, let me recall: in triangle ABC, side a is BC, opposite angle A; side b is AC, opposite angle B; side c is AB, opposite angle C.

So applying that here, for triangle TRS:

- Side TR is opposite angle S. Because angle S is at vertex S, so the side opposite is TR.
- Side SR is opposite angle T. Similarly, angle T is at vertex T, so the side opposite is SR.
Therefore, since TR = SR, the sides opposite angles S and T are equal. Therefore, angles T and S are equal. Wait, because in an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are equal. Therefore, angle T (∠T) and angle S (∠S) are equal.

But we know that angle at R (∠R) is 70 degrees. Since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, then:

∠R + ∠T + ∠S = 180°
We have ∠R = 70°, and ∠T = ∠S.

So, substituting:

70° + ∠T + ∠S = 180°
But ∠T = ∠S, so:

70° + 2∠T = 180°
Subtract 70°:

2∠T = 110°
Divide by 2:

∠T = 55°

But the question asks for m∠RST. Wait, angle RST is the angle at point S, right? Because angle RST is written as Angle(R, S, T), meaning the angle at point S between points R and T. So that's ∠S. Which we just found to be 55 degrees. Therefore, the answer should be 55°, which is option A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the notation. Let me confirm once again.

Original problem states: Find m∠RST. So, angle RST is the angle at point S, with segments RS and ST. Wait, but in our triangle, the vertices are T, R, S. So, angle at S would be between points R, S, T. So yes, ∠RST is angle at S. And since in the triangle, angles at T and S are equal, and angle at R is 70°, then ∠S is 55°, so answer is A.

Alternatively, maybe there's another interpretation. Suppose the triangle isn't TRS, but some other configuration. Wait, but the given information is about angle at R being 70°, and sides TR and SR being equal. So, if you imagine triangle TRS, with R as the vertex where the two equal sides meet. Wait, TR and SR are the two sides connected to R. So TR and SR are both connected to R, meaning that R is the apex of the isosceles triangle. Therefore, the two equal sides are TR and SR, so the legs are TR and SR, making the base TS. Then, the base angles would be at T and S. Wait, but earlier conclusion was that angles at T and S are equal. Wait, but in that case, angle at R is 70°, so the other two angles add up to 110°, hence each is 55°, so angle at S is 55°, which is ∠RST. So yes, answer is A.

But let me check again. Maybe I misread the problem. Let me re-express:

Given:

Measure of angle(TRS) = 70°, because Angle(T,R,S) is angle at R between T and S.

TR = SR. So sides TR and SR are equal.

Thus, triangle TRS with TR=SR, so it's an isosceles triangle with equal sides TR and SR. Therefore, the base is TS, and the two equal sides are TR and SR. Thus, the base angles are at T and S. Wait, but in this case, the apex angle is at R. Therefore, the base angles are at T and S. Hence, they are equal. Therefore, their measures are (180 - 70)/2 = 55°, so each of them is 55°. Therefore, angle at S, which is ∠RST, is 55°, so answer A.

Yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is A.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $ \angle RST $, we begin by analyzing the given geometric constraints:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Given Information**

We are told:

- $ \text{MeasureOf}( \angle T, R, S ) = 70^\circ $
  
This means the angle at vertex $ R $, formed by segments $ RT $ and $ RS $, is $ 70^\circ $. That is,
$$
\angle TRS = 70^\circ
$$

Also, we are given:

- $ \text{LengthOf}(RT) = \text{LengthOf}(RS) $

So, the triangle $ \triangle TRS $ has two equal sides: $ RT = RS $. This makes $ \triangle TRS $ an **isosceles triangle** with equal sides $ RT $ and $ RS $.

---

### **Step 2: Use Triangle Angle Sum Theorem**

In any triangle, the sum of the interior angles is always $ 180^\circ $. For triangle $ \triangle TRS $, we have:

$$
\angle TRS + \angle RST + \angle RTS = 180^\circ
$$

From Step 1, we already know:
$$
\angle TRS = 70^\circ
$$

Because $ RT = RS $, the triangle is isosceles with base $ TS $, and thus the base angles $ \angle RST $ and $ \angle RTS $ are equal.

Let’s denote:
$$
\angle RST = x \quad \text{and} \quad \angle RTS = x
$$

Now plug into the angle sum equation:
$$
70^\circ + x + x = 180^\circ \\
70^\circ + 2x = 180^\circ \\
2x = 110^\circ \\
x = 55^\circ
$$

---

### **Step 3: Final Answer**

Since $ \angle RST = x = 55^\circ $, the measure of $ \angle RST $ is:

$$
\boxed{55}
$$

---

### **Final Answer: A**
