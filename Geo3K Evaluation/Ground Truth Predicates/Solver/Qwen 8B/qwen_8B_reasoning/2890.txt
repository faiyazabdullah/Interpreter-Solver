MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. Hmm, so we have several points and lines with certain constraints. Let me start by listing out all the given information to make sure I don't miss anything.

First, the lengths:

- The length of line PQ is 25 units. So PQ = 25.
- The length of line RT is x (which we need to find? Wait, no—the question asks for PT. Wait, maybe x is part of solving for PT. Let me check again.)
Wait, the question says "Find PT." But the given LengthOf(Line(R,T)) is x. So x is RT, but we might need to relate it to PT somehow. Also, RS is 10, and SQ is 5. 

Then there are point positions:

- Point T lies on line PR. So T is somewhere along the line connecting P and R.
- Point S lies on line QR. So S is somewhere along the line connecting Q and R.
Also, two perpendicularity and parallelism conditions:

- Line RT is perpendicular to line RS. So angle at R between RT and RS is 90 degrees.
- Lines PQ and TS are parallel. So PQ || TS.

So our goal is to find the length of PT. Let me visualize this. Maybe drawing a diagram would help, but since I can't draw, I'll try to imagine coordinates.

Let me assign coordinates to the points to make this easier. Coordinates can help apply coordinate geometry here.

Let me place point R at the origin (0,0) because that might simplify things with the perpendicularity condition. Since RS is 10 and RT is perpendicular to RS, which is a line from R. If RS is horizontal or vertical? Well, since RT is perpendicular to RS, their slopes multiply to -1.

But maybe assigning coordinates smartly. Let me assume RS is along the x-axis, so S is at (a, 0). Then RT would be vertical, since it's perpendicular. So if R is at (0,0), then S could be at (s, 0), and T would be at (0, t) since RT is vertical. Wait, but T lies on line PR. Hmm, perhaps I need more structure.

Alternatively, maybe set up coordinate system with R at origin, as mentioned.

Let me proceed step by step.

Let’s denote coordinates:

Let me take R as (0,0).

Since RS has length 10, and S lies on QR. Let me first define coordinates for Q and R such that S is on QR. Also, PQ is 25, and SQ is 5. So SQ = 5, meaning that S divides QR into segments QS and SR?

Wait, S is on QR. So QR is a line segment from Q to R. So S lies somewhere between Q and R. Then SQ is 5, so the distance from S to Q is 5. And RS is 10, so the distance from R to S is 10. Therefore, QR is split by S into parts: QS = 5 and SR = 10. Therefore, total length QR is QS + SR = 5 + 10 = 15. So QR = 15.

Therefore, coordinates of S can be determined once we know coordinates of Q and R. But since R is at (0,0), let me think about how to position Q.

Let me suppose that R is at (0,0), and S is on QR. Since RS = 10, and S is closer to R than to Q (since QS = 5), then QR is divided by S such that QS : SR = 5 : 10 = 1 : 2. Therefore, S divides QR internally in ratio QS/SR = 1/2.

So using section formula, coordinates of S can be expressed in terms of Q and R. Let me denote coordinates:

Let me assign coordinates to Q. Let me suppose Q is at some point (q_x, q_y). Then since S divides QR in ratio QS:SR = 1:2, then coordinates of S would be [(2*q_x + 1*0)/ (1+2), (2*q_y + 1*0)/(1+2)] = (2q_x/3, 2q_y/3). Because when you divide a segment from Q to R in ratio m:n, the coordinates are (nQ + mR)/(m + n). Here, since QS:SR = 1:2, m corresponds to the segment adjacent to R, so m=2, n=1? Wait, wait. Wait, the ratio is QS:SR = 1:2. So starting from Q, moving towards R, the point S divides QR in the ratio QS:SR = 1:2. So the section formula would be S = ( (2 * Q + 1 * R ) / (1 + 2) ). Yes, that's right. So coordinates of S are ((2q_x)/3, (2q_y)/3).

Additionally, since RS has length 10, which is the distance from R(0,0) to S(2q_x/3, 2q_y/3). So sqrt[(2q_x/3)^2 + (2q_y/3)^2] = 10. Squaring both sides: (4(q_x² + q_y²))/9 = 100 → q_x² + q_y² = (100 * 9)/4 = 225. Therefore, the distance from R(0,0) to Q(q_x, q_y) is sqrt(q_x² + q_y²) = sqrt(225) = 15. Which matches our earlier conclusion that QR = 15. Good.

Now, also, PQ = 25. So the distance between P and Q is 25. Also, note that T lies on PR. So T is a point on line PR. Additionally, RT is perpendicular to RS. Since RS is from R(0,0) to S(2q_x/3, 2q_y/3). So vector RS is (2q_x/3, 2q_y/3). Therefore, direction of RS is (q_x, q_y) scaled by 2/3. Wait, but RT is perpendicular to RS. So the line RT is perpendicular to RS. Therefore, the slope of RT times slope of RS equals -1.

But since T lies on PR, which connects P and R(0,0). Let me consider coordinates of P. Let me denote P as (p_x, p_y). Then line PR goes from P(p_x, p_y) to R(0,0). So parametric equations for PR: any point on PR can be written as (tp_x, tp_y) where t ranges from 0 to 1 (for points between P and R) or beyond.

But T is a point on PR. So coordinates of T can be represented as (k*p_x, k*p_y) for some scalar k. However, depending on whether T is between P and R or extended beyond. Not sure yet.

Also, RT is perpendicular to RS. Vector RT is from R(0,0) to T(kp_x, kp_y): so vector RT is (kp_x, kp_y). Vector RS is (2q_x/3, 2q_y/3). Their dot product should be zero because they are perpendicular.

Dot product: (kp_x)(2q_x/3) + (kp_y)(2q_y/3) = 0 → 2k/3 (q_x p_x + q_y p_y) = 0. Assuming k ≠ 0 (since otherwise T would be at R, but then RT length would be zero, but RT is given as x; unless x is zero, but probably not. So we can say that q_x p_x + q_y p_y = 0. Therefore, the dot product of vectors QR and PR is zero? Wait, QR is from Q to R? Wait, no. Wait, vector RS is from R to S, and vector RT is from R to T. So their dot product being zero implies that RT ⊥ RS. So yes, that gives us q_x p_x + q_y p_y = 0. That's equation (1).

Also, since PQ has length 25. PQ is from P(p_x, p_y) to Q(q_x, q_y). So distance squared is (q_x - p_x)^2 + (q_y - p_y)^2 = 25^2 = 625. Equation (2).

Moreover, there is another condition: lines PQ and TS are parallel. So the slope of PQ equals the slope of TS.

First, compute slope of PQ. Slope of PQ is (q_y - p_y)/(q_x - p_x).

Slope of TS: Points T and S. Coordinates of T: (k p_x, k p_y). Coordinates of S: (2q_x/3, 2q_y/3). So slope of TS is [ (2q_y/3 - k p_y) ] / [ (2q_x/3 - k p_x) ].

Set equal to slope of PQ:

[ (2q_y/3 - k p_y) ] / [ (2q_x/3 - k p_x) ] = (q_y - p_y)/(q_x - p_x)

Cross-multiplying:

(2q_y/3 - k p_y)(q_x - p_x) = (2q_x/3 - k p_x)(q_y - p_y)

This seems complicated. Let me see if I can find relations between variables.

Earlier, from the perpendicularity condition, we had q_x p_x + q_y p_y = 0. Let me denote that as equation (1).

Also, from the fact that S lies on QR, which we already used to get the relation for coordinates of S. Now, maybe we can express p_x and p_y in terms of q_x and q_y, or find relations between them.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing specific coordinates to reduce variables. For example, since we have vectors involved, maybe aligning axes to simplify.

Let me consider setting coordinates such that R is at (0,0), and RS is along the x-axis. Wait, earlier thought: if RS is along x-axis, then since RT is perpendicular to RS, RT would be along y-axis. But then T would lie along y-axis. Also, since T lies on PR, which connects P and R(0,0). So if RT is along y-axis, then T is (0, t) for some t. But then PR passes through T. So PR is a line passing through R(0,0) and T(0,t), so PR is the y-axis itself. Therefore, P would be somewhere along the y-axis? Wait, but then PQ is a line from P to Q, which would have to satisfy PQ = 25, etc. Maybe this approach can work.

Let me try that. Let me set R at (0,0). Let me take RS along x-axis. So S is on x-axis. Since RS has length 10, then S is at (10, 0). Wait, but earlier we said that S divides QR into QS = 5 and SR = 10. So QR is from Q to R(0,0), with S lying between Q and R such that QS = 5, SR = 10. So if S is at (s_x, s_y), then QR is from Q to R(0,0). If RS is along x-axis, then S is at (something, 0). Let me fix coordinates accordingly.

Let me assume that RS is along positive x-axis. So S is at (10, 0), since RS = 10. Then R is at (0,0). Then Q is located such that S lies on QR, and QS = 5. Since S is between Q and R, then Q is located at some point such that moving from Q to S to R. So vector from Q to S is towards R. So coordinates of Q can be found based on S being 5 units away from Q.

If S is at (10, 0), then Q is located along the line extending from S through R. Wait, since S is between Q and R. So QR is from Q to R, passing through S. Therefore, coordinates of Q can be determined as follows: since S divides QR in ratio QS:SR = 1:2 (as before). So from Q to S to R, with QS = 5, SR = 10. So the entire QR length is 15. Therefore, coordinates of Q can be found by going from S in the opposite direction of R for 5 units. Since S is at (10, 0), and R is at (0,0), the direction from S to R is (-10, 0). To go back from S to Q, same direction but 5 units. Wait, since QS = 5, so from S, moving in the direction opposite to R (i.e., away from R) for 5 units. Wait, actually, the vector from Q to S is proportional to the vector from S to R. Because S divides QR in ratio QS:SR = 1:2. So the coordinates of Q can be determined by extending from S in the direction opposite to R.

The vector from S to R is R - S = (0 - 10, 0 - 0) = (-10, 0). So to find Q, we go from S in the direction opposite to R (i.e., adding the same vector multiplied by the ratio). Since QS:SR = 1:2, then the coordinates of Q are S + (vector SR) * (QS/SR) ?

Wait, the ratio QS:SR = 1:2, so the coordinates of S can be expressed as Q + (SR vector)*(1/(1+2))? No, better to use section formula.

Coordinates of S dividing QR in ratio QS:SR = 1:2. So S divides QR internally in ratio m:n where m corresponds to the segment near Q and n near R. Wait, the section formula states that if a point S divides QR in ratio m:n (from Q to R), then coordinates of S are ( (n*Q_x + m*R_x)/(m + n), ... )

In this case, since QS:SR = 1:2, then m = 1 (portion near Q), n = 2 (portion near R). Therefore,

S_x = (2*Q_x + 1*R_x)/(1 + 2) = (2Q_x + 0)/3 = 2Q_x / 3

Similarly, S_y = 2Q_y / 3.

We know S is at (10, 0). So:

2Q_x / 3 = 10 => Q_x = (10 * 3)/2 = 15

and 2Q_y / 3 = 0 => Q_y = 0.

Therefore, Q is at (15, 0). Wait, but then Q is at (15, 0), R is at (0,0), and S is at (10, 0). So QR is along x-axis from (15,0) to (0,0), with S at (10,0). That makes sense: QS = distance from Q(15,0) to S(10,0) is 5 units, SR = from S(10,0) to R(0,0) is 10 units. Perfect!

So now, coordinates:

- R: (0, 0)
- S: (10, 0)
- Q: (15, 0)
- PQ is a line from P to Q(15, 0), with PQ = 25.

Also, T lies on line PR. And RT is perpendicular to RS. Since RS is along x-axis from R(0,0) to S(10,0), so RS is horizontal. Therefore, RT must be vertical (perpendicular to horizontal). Hence, line RT is vertical, i.e., along y-axis. Therefore, since R is at (0,0), and RT is vertical, then T has coordinates (0, t) for some t. So T is at (0, t). Therefore, line PR passes through T(0, t) and R(0,0). Therefore, line PR is the vertical line x=0. Thus, point P must lie along the vertical line x=0, because PR is from P to R(0,0), and T is on PR. Therefore, P is somewhere along the y-axis. Let me confirm.

Yes, since line PR is vertical (x=0), then P must be at (0, p) for some p. Let me denote P as (0, p). Then, coordinates of P are (0, p). Now, PQ is the line from P(0,p) to Q(15,0), and its length is 25.

Compute PQ length: distance between (0,p) and (15,0):

sqrt[(15 - 0)^2 + (0 - p)^2] = sqrt(225 + p²) = 25.

So:

sqrt(225 + p²) = 25 → square both sides: 225 + p² = 625 → p² = 625 - 225 = 400 → p = ±20. So P is either (0,20) or (0,-20). Depending on the orientation. Since the problem doesn't specify direction, but since RT is perpendicular to RS (horizontal), and T is on PR. Let's assume standard orientation; maybe it's arbitrary. Let's take p = 20 for simplicity. So P is at (0,20).

Now, T is on PR, which is the vertical line x=0 from R(0,0) to P(0,20). So T is at (0, t), where t is between 0 and 20 or outside. But RT is the segment from R(0,0) to T(0,t). The length RT is |t|, since it's vertical. Given that RT is x, but we need to find PT. Wait, but the problem says to find PT. Let me recall that.

But before that, there's another condition: lines PQ and TS are parallel. So PQ || TS.

We have PQ as the line from P(0,20) to Q(15,0). Let me compute its slope.

Slope of PQ: (0 - 20)/(15 - 0) = (-20)/15 = -4/3.

Now, line TS is from T(0,t) to S(10,0). Compute slope of TS: (0 - t)/(10 - 0) = (-t)/10.

Since PQ || TS, their slopes must be equal. So:

-4/3 = -t / 10 → cross-multiplied: -4 * 10 = -3 t → -40 = -3t → t = 40/3 ≈ 13.333...

Thus, T is at (0, 40/3). Therefore, coordinates of T are (0, 40/3). Now, we need to find PT.

P is at (0,20), T is at (0, 40/3). Since they're on the vertical line x=0, the distance PT is |20 - 40/3|. Let's calculate:

Convert 20 to thirds: 20 = 60/3. So 60/3 - 40/3 = 20/3. Therefore, PT = 20/3. So the answer is 20/3, which is option B.

Wait, but let me verify if my assumption about P being at (0,20) is valid. What if P were at (0,-20)? Let me check.

If P were at (0,-20), then slope of PQ would be (0 - (-20))/(15 - 0) = 20/15 = 4/3. Then slope of TS would need to be 4/3. But TS slope is (-t)/10. Setting 4/3 = -t/10 → t = -40/3. Then T would be at (0, -40/3). Then PT would be distance between (0,-20) and (0,-40/3). |-20 - (-40/3)| = |-20 + 40/3| = |-60/3 + 40/3| = |-20/3| = 20/3. Same result. So regardless of direction, PT is 20/3. Hence, answer is B.

But let me double-check everything to ensure no mistakes.

First, coordinates setup:

- R(0,0), S(10,0), Q(15,0), P(0,20). PQ length: sqrt((15)^2 + (20)^2) = sqrt(225 + 400) = sqrt(625)=25. Correct.

T is on PR, which is vertical line x=0. T is (0, t). RT length is |t - 0| = |t|. Perpendicularity: RT is vertical, RS is horizontal, so they are indeed perpendicular. Check.

Slope of PQ: -4/3. Slope of TS: from T(0,t) to S(10,0): (0 - t)/(10 - 0) = -t/10. Set equal to -4/3: -t/10 = -4/3 ⇒ t = 40/3. So T is at (0, 40/3). Then PT is from P(0,20) to T(0,40/3): difference in y-coordinates is 20 - 40/3 = 60/3 - 40/3 = 20/3. So yes, PT = 20/3. Which is option B.

Hence, the answer is B.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the length $ PT $, we begin by analyzing the given geometric constraints and applying coordinate geometry systematically.

---

### **Step 1: Coordinate Setup**

We assign coordinates strategically to simplify the relationships:

- Place point **$ R $** at the origin: $ R = (0, 0) $
- Since $ RS = 10 $ and $ \overline{RS} \perp \overline{RT} $, we align $ RS $ horizontally. So, $ S = (10, 0) $
- Since $ S $ lies on $ \overline{QR} $, and $ QS = 5 $, we determine the location of $ Q $. From $ S $ to $ R $ is 10 units, so $ Q $ is 5 units further in the same direction as $ \vec{RS} $. Thus, $ Q = (15, 0) $

---

### **Step 2: Determine Coordinates of $ P $**

Given $ PQ = 25 $, and knowing $ Q = (15, 0) $, we assume $ P $ lies vertically above or below $ R $ due to the perpendicular relationship with $ \overline{RS} $ (horizontal), making $ \overline{PR} $ vertical.

Let $ P = (0, p) $. Then the distance $ PQ = \sqrt{(15 - 0)^2 + (0 - p)^2} = \sqrt{225 + p^2} = 25 $. Solving:

$$
\sqrt{225 + p^2} = 25 \Rightarrow 225 + p^2 = 625 \Rightarrow p^2 = 400 \Rightarrow p = \pm 20
$$

So, possible values for $ P $ are $ (0, 20) $ or $ (0, -20) $. We’ll continue with $ P = (0, 20) $ without loss of generality.

---

### **Step 3: Find Coordinates of $ T $ Using Parallel Condition**

It is given that $ \overline{PQ} \parallel \overline{TS} $. First, compute the slope of $ \overline{PQ} $:

$$
\text{slope}_{PQ} = \frac{0 - 20}{15 - 0} = -\frac{4}{3}
$$

Let $ T = (0, t) $, as it lies on line $ \overline{PR} $ (vertical line through $ R = (0, 0) $ and $ P = (0, 20) $). So $ T $ is on the y-axis.

Now compute the slope of $ \overline{TS} $, from $ T = (0, t) $ to $ S = (10, 0) $:

$$
\text{slope}_{TS} = \frac{0 - t}{10 - 0} = -\frac{t}{10}
$$

Setting the slopes equal (since $ \overline{PQ} \parallel \overline{TS} $):

$$
-\frac{4}{3} = -\frac{t}{10} \Rightarrow t = \frac{40}{3}
$$

So, $ T = (0, \frac{40}{3}) $

---

### **Step 4: Calculate $ PT $**

Now compute the distance between $ P = (0, 20) $ and $ T = (0, \frac{40}{3}) $:

$$
PT = \left| 20 - \frac{40}{3} \right| = \left| \frac{60}{3} - \frac{40}{3} \right| = \frac{20}{3}
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

After carefully analyzing the geometric configuration and using coordinate geometry, we find that the length of $ PT $ is:

$$
\boxed{\frac{20}{3}}
$$
