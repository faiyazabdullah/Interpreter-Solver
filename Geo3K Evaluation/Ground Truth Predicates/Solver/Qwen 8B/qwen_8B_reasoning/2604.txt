MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So we have points A, B, and C. The problem gives us some constraints:

First, the length of line AB is x. Then, the length of AC is x minus 3. The length of BC is 9. Also, lines CA and CB are perpendicular. Wait, so point C is connected to both A and B, and those two lines are perpendicular. That makes me think that triangle ABC is a right triangle at point C. Because if CA and CB are perpendicular, then angle at C is 90 degrees. 

So, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at C. Therefore, according to the Pythagorean theorem, the sum of the squares of the legs should equal the square of the hypotenuse. But wait, which sides are the legs here? Since the right angle is at C, the legs would be AC and BC, and the hypotenuse would be AB. Let me confirm that.

Yes, because in a right triangle, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. So if the right angle is at C, then AB is the hypotenuse. Therefore, AB² = AC² + BC². 

Given that, let's plug in the values. We know AB is x, AC is x - 3, and BC is 9. So substituting into the equation:

x² = (x - 3)² + 9²

Let me expand that. First, expand (x - 3)²: that's x² - 6x + 9. Then add 81 for the 9 squared. So:

x² = x² - 6x + 9 + 81  
Simplify the right side: 9 + 81 is 90, so:

x² = x² - 6x + 90

Now subtract x² from both sides to get rid of the x² terms:

0 = -6x + 90

Then, adding 6x to both sides:

6x = 90

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 15

Wait, so x equals 15. Let me check if that makes sense. If x is 15, then AC is 15 - 3 = 12. Then AB is 15, BC is 9. Let's verify the Pythagorean theorem:

AB² = 15² = 225  
AC² + BC² = 12² + 9² = 144 + 81 = 225  
Yes, that checks out. So x is indeed 15. Looking at the answer choices, option B is 15. So the correct answer should be B.

But wait, just to make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. The problem says Perpendicular(Line(C, A), Line(C, B)). So that means lines CA and CB are perpendicular. Which confirms that angle at C is right. So yes, the triangle is right-angled at C, so my approach was correct. 

Another thing to check: lengths can't be negative. If x were less than 3, then AC would be negative, which isn't possible. So x has to be greater than 3. Our solution x=15 is valid. 

Therefore, the answer is B. 15.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by interpreting the geometric relationships described:

- $ \text{Length}(AB) = x $
- $ \text{Length}(AC) = x - 3 $
- $ \text{Length}(BC) = 9 $
- Lines $ CA $ and $ CB $ are **perpendicular**, meaning triangle $ ABC $ is a **right triangle** with the right angle at vertex $ C $.

### Step 1: Use the Pythagorean Theorem

In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Here, since the right angle is at $ C $, the hypotenuse is $ AB $, and the legs are $ AC $ and $ BC $. Thus:

$$
AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2
$$

Substitute the known expressions:

$$
x^2 = (x - 3)^2 + 9^2
$$

---

### Step 2: Expand and Simplify

Expand $ (x - 3)^2 $:

$$
(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9
$$

Add $ 9^2 = 81 $:

$$
x^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9 + 81
\Rightarrow x^2 = x^2 - 6x + 90
$$

Subtract $ x^2 $ from both sides:

$$
0 = -6x + 90
$$

Solve for $ x $:

$$
6x = 90 \Rightarrow x = 15
$$

---

### Step 3: Validate the Solution

Plug back $ x = 15 $ into the original lengths:

- $ AB = 15 $
- $ AC = 15 - 3 = 12 $
- $ BC = 9 $

Check the Pythagorean Theorem:

$$
AB^2 = 15^2 = 225 \\
AC^2 + BC^2 = 12^2 + 9^2 = 144 + 81 = 225
$$

The relationship holds true, confirming our solution.

\boxed{\text{B}}
$$
