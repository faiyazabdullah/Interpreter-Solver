====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, we need to find the length of ST given some conditions about midsegments and angles. Let me start by recalling what midsegments are. 

Midsegments in a triangle connect the midpoints of two sides and are parallel to the third side, right? And their length is half the length of that third side. Wait, but here they mention XY and XZ as midsegments. Hmm. Wait, the question says "XY and XZ are midsegments of triangle RST." Wait, hold on. Midsegments are segments connecting midpoints. So each midsegment connects two midpoints. But here, maybe there's confusion. Let me parse the problem again.

The given constraints include:

- Length of RT is 13. So RT = 13.

- Length of XY is 7. So XY = 7.

- The measure of angle at Z (angle ZXY?) is 124 degrees. Wait, the notation MeasureOf(Angle(Z, X, Y)) would be angle at X between points Z, X, Y. So it's angle ZXY, which is 124 degrees.

Then, PointLiesOnLine(Y, Line(R, T)): So point Y lies on line RT.

PointLiesOnLine(X, Line(R, S)): So point X lies on line RS.

PointLiesOnLine(Z, Line(T, S)): So point Z lies on line TS.

Additionally, XY and XZ are midsegments of triangle RST.

Wait, so XY and XZ are both midsegments. Let me think. In triangle RST, a midsegment would be a segment connecting the midpoints of two sides. For example, if you take midpoints of RS and RT, then the midsegment would be connecting those two midpoints. Similarly for others.

But here, the problem states that XY and XZ are midsegments. So maybe X is a midpoint? Or perhaps X, Y, Z are midpoints?

Let me try to visualize triangle RST. Let me sketch mentally.

Points R, S, T form triangle RST. Now, points X, Y, Z lie on certain lines. Let me note:

- Y lies on RT. Since RT has length 13.

- X lies on RS.

- Z lies on TS.

So, X is on RS, Y is on RT, Z is on TS.

Now, XY and XZ are midsegments. So, since a midsegment connects midpoints of two sides, so XY is a midsegment. Therefore, XY should be connecting midpoints of two sides. Similarly for XZ.

Wait, but how can XY be a midsegment? If XY connects midpoints of two sides. Let me see. Suppose in triangle RST, if X is the midpoint of RS, and Y is the midpoint of RT, then XY would be a midsegment, connecting midpoints of RS and RT, hence being parallel to ST and half its length. Similarly, if XZ is another midsegment, then maybe Z is the midpoint of TS? Wait, but Z is on TS. So if Z is the midpoint of TS, then XZ could be another midsegment. But then X would have to be the midpoint of another side. Wait, but X is already on RS. So maybe X is the midpoint of RS, Y is the midpoint of RT, and Z is the midpoint of TS. Then XY is a midsegment connecting midpoints of RS and RT, and XZ would be... Wait, no, because X is the midpoint of RS, and Z is the midpoint of TS. Then XZ would connect the midpoint of RS to the midpoint of TS. That would make XZ a midsegment? Wait, but midsegments connect midpoints of two sides. So, if X is the midpoint of RS and Z is the midpoint of TS, then connecting them would be a midsegment. However, in a triangle, the midsegments connect midpoints of two sides and are parallel to the third side. So, if X is the midpoint of RS and Z is the midpoint of TS, then the segment XZ would be parallel to RT and half its length. Wait, but RT is given as 13. So if XZ is a midsegment, then XZ should be half of RT, which would be 6.5. But according to the problem, the length of XY is 7. Which is different from 6.5. Hmm. Maybe my assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps XY and XZ are midsegments meaning that each is a midsegment. Let me consider that. Let me think again.

If XY is a midsegment, then it must connect the midpoints of two sides. Similarly for XZ. But since X is common in both XY and XZ, maybe X is a midpoint of one side, and Y and Z are midpoints of other sides?

For instance, suppose X is the midpoint of RS. Then, if XY is a midsegment, then Y must be the midpoint of RT. Because connecting midpoints of RS and RT gives a midsegment. Similarly, if XZ is a midsegment, then Z would be the midpoint of ST. Because connecting midpoints of RS and ST would give a midsegment. Wait, but then Z would be on TS, which matches the given condition that Z lies on TS. So, if Z is the midpoint of TS, then yes, it's on TS. So then, X is midpoint of RS, Y is midpoint of RT, Z is midpoint of TS.

In that case, XY would be the midsegment connecting midpoints of RS and RT, so XY is parallel to ST and half its length. Similarly, XZ would be the midsegment connecting midpoints of RS and TS, so XZ would be parallel to RT and half its length. But RT is given as 13, so XZ should be 13/2=6.5. However, the problem says that the length of XY is 7. But according to this, XY should be half of ST. Wait, if XY is parallel to ST and half its length, then XY = (1/2) * ST. So ST would be twice XY. Given that XY is 7, then ST would be 14. Which is option C. But wait, let me check if this holds.

But also, the problem mentions angle ZXY is 124 degrees. So angle at X between Z and Y. Let me think about that. If X is the midpoint of RS, Y is the midpoint of RT, and Z is the midpoint of TS. Then, the coordinates might help. Alternatively, using vectors or coordinate geometry. But maybe I can use the fact that the midsegments are parallel to the opposite sides. So, XY is parallel to ST, and XZ is parallel to RT.

Therefore, angle ZXY would be equal to angle between XZ and XY. Since XZ is parallel to RT, and XY is parallel to ST. So, angle between XZ and XY would correspond to the angle between RT and ST. Wait, but angle at X between Z and Y. Let me think. Let me imagine triangle RST. X is midpoint of RS, Y is midpoint of RT, Z is midpoint of TS. So, XY is midline parallel to ST, and XZ is midline parallel to RT. So, angle ZXY is formed by the two midlines XZ and XY. Since XZ || RT and XY || ST, then angle between XZ and XY is same as angle between RT and ST. Wait, but angle between RT and ST is angle at T in triangle RST. Wait, no. Let me clarify. If XZ is parallel to RT, and XY is parallel to ST, then the angle between XZ and XY is equal to the angle between RT and ST. But the original angle at T is between RT and ST. Wait, but angle ZXY is at X, so perhaps related to angle at T? Not sure. But the problem says that angle ZXY is 124 degrees. So, maybe this can help us verify something else?

But maybe there's a contradiction here. Because according to our earlier reasoning, if XY is a midsegment, then XY = 1/2 ST. Given that XY is 7, then ST would be 14. Which is option C. But why does the angle matter here? Is there a possibility that the angle affects this?

Wait, but if XY is parallel to ST, then the angle between XY and XZ (which is angle ZXY) would be supplementary or equal to some other angle? Let me think. Since XY is parallel to ST, and XZ is parallel to RT. So, if you imagine translating the figure such that X maps to T, then XY (parallel to ST) would align with ST. But not sure. Alternatively, considering the direction of the lines. Let me try to think of coordinates.

Let me assign coordinates to the triangle to test this. Let me assume coordinates for triangle RST. Let me place point R at (0, 0), S at (a, 0), and T at (b, c). Then, midpoints:

- X is midpoint of RS: ((0 + a)/2, (0 + 0)/2) = (a/2, 0)

- Y is midpoint of RT: ((0 + b)/2, (0 + c)/2) = (b/2, c/2)

- Z is midpoint of TS: ((b + a)/2, (c + 0)/2) = ((a + b)/2, c/2)

So, XY connects X(a/2, 0) to Y(b/2, c/2). The vector from X to Y is (b/2 - a/2, c/2 - 0) = ((b - a)/2, c/2). The length of XY is sqrt[ ((b - a)/2)^2 + (c/2)^2 ] = (1/2)sqrt[(b - a)^2 + c^2]. But (b - a)^2 + c^2 is the squared length of RT. Wait, RT is from R(0,0) to T(b,c). So length RT is sqrt(b² + c²). Therefore, XY length is (1/2)*sqrt(b² + c²) = (1/2)*RT. Therefore, XY = (1/2)*RT. But in the problem, RT is 13, so XY should be 13/2 = 6.5. But the problem says XY is 7. Contradiction! So my initial assumption must be wrong. Therefore, XY is not the midsegment connecting midpoints of RS and RT. Hence, my previous conclusion was incorrect.

Hmm. So that suggests that either my understanding of which midsegments are involved is wrong, or there's more to the problem.

Wait, but the problem says "XY and XZ are midsegments of triangle RST". So both XY and XZ are midsegments. So each of these segments is a midsegment. So, each midsegment connects midpoints of two sides. So, for example, XY could be a midsegment connecting midpoints of RS and RT, making it parallel to ST. Similarly, XZ could be a midsegment connecting midpoints of RS and ST, making it parallel to RT. However, in that case, XY would be half of ST, and XZ would be half of RT. But given that RT is 13, then XZ should be 13/2=6.5. However, the problem states that XY is 7, which conflicts with that. So unless there's another configuration.

Alternatively, maybe XY is a midsegment connecting midpoints of RT and ST, making it parallel to RS. Then, XY would be half of RS. Similarly, XZ could be a midsegment connecting midpoints of RT and RS, making it parallel to ST. Wait, but how does that fit with the positions of X, Y, Z?

Wait, let me re-examine the positions:

- X lies on RS.

- Y lies on RT.

- Z lies on TS.

So, if XY is a midsegment, it must connect midpoints of two sides. Let me think: If XY connects midpoints of RT and RS, then X would be the midpoint of RS and Y the midpoint of RT. But then X is midpoint of RS, Y is midpoint of RT. So XY is a midsegment parallel to ST, length half of ST. But then, according to problem, XY is 7, so ST would be 14. Which is option C. But earlier calculation with coordinates gave XY as half of RT, which contradicts. What's the issue here?

Ah, wait! In my coordinate system, when I considered XY connecting midpoints of RS and RT, then XY is parallel to ST and length half of ST. But in that case, RT is the hypotenuse from R(0,0) to T(b,c), whose length is sqrt(b² + c²). But ST is from S(a,0) to T(b,c), so length sqrt((b - a)^2 + c²). So XY length is half of ST. So if XY is 7, then ST is 14. So that would mean answer is C. But earlier when I thought XY was half RT, that was wrong. Because in that scenario, XY is parallel to ST, so XY is half of ST, not RT. So that seems okay.

But then, why did my coordinate calculation say that XY length is half of RT? Because I made a mistake in calculation. Let me redo that.

Earlier, I said that XY connects X(a/2, 0) to Y(b/2, c/2). So the vector from X to Y is ( (b/2 - a/2), c/2 ). So the distance is sqrt[ ((b - a)/2 )² + (c/2 )² ] = (1/2) * sqrt( (b - a)² + c² ). But (b - a)² + c² is the square of the length of ST. Because ST goes from S(a,0) to T(b,c). So yes, ST length squared is (b - a)^2 + (c - 0)^2 = (b - a)^2 + c². Thus, XY is half of ST. So if XY is 7, then ST is 14. So that would make sense. So then ST would be 14, which is option C. 

But then why did I get confused earlier? Because I mistakenly thought that RT was connected, but actually, XY is parallel to ST. So that seems okay. Also, the angle given is angle ZXY = 124 degrees. How does that play into this?

Well, if XY is parallel to ST, and XZ is another midsegment. Let's see. If XZ is a midsegment, then it connects midpoints of two sides. Since X is on RS and Z is on TS. So if XZ is a midsegment, then it must connect midpoints of RS and TS. So X is midpoint of RS, and Z is midpoint of TS. Then XZ is a midsegment parallel to RT, and its length would be half of RT. Given that RT is 13, then XZ should be 13/2=6.5. However, the problem doesn't specify the length of XZ, only that XY is 7. So that seems okay. 

But then, how does the angle come into play? Let's consider angle ZXY. Since XY is parallel to ST, and XZ is parallel to RT. So, angle between XY and XZ would be equal to angle between ST and RT. Wait, but angle between XY and XZ is at point X. Since XY is parallel to ST and XZ is parallel to RT, then the angle between XY and XZ is equal to the angle between ST and RT. But angle between ST and RT is the angle at point T of triangle RST. Wait, because RT and ST meet at point T. So the angle between RT and ST is angle at T, which is angle RTS. So angle ZXY equals angle RTS. But the problem says angle ZXY is 124 degrees. So angle RTS is 124 degrees. 

But how does that affect anything? Well, maybe we can use the Law of Cosines on triangle RST. If we know RT = 13, ST = 14 (as per earlier), and angle at T is 124 degrees, then we could compute RS. But wait, the problem isn't asking for RS; it's asking for ST. Wait, but if we already assumed ST is 14 based on XY being 7, then that would be the answer. But is there a way that angle could affect this? For example, if there were inconsistencies?

Wait, but if we suppose that ST is 14, then angle at T is 124 degrees, and RT is 13. Then, using the Law of Cosines, we could find RS. But since the problem doesn't ask for RS, maybe that's not necessary. 

However, let me check whether there's another possibility. Suppose that XY is not the midsegment connecting midpoints of RS and RT, but instead, for example, XY connects midpoints of RT and ST. Then XY would be parallel to RS and half its length. Then, since XY is 7, RS would be 14. But the problem asks for ST, which would still depend on other information. 

Alternatively, maybe X is not the midpoint of RS. Wait, but if XY is a midsegment, then it must connect midpoints of two sides. Since X is on RS and Y is on RT, then XY would be connecting midpoints of RS and RT. Therefore, X is midpoint of RS and Y is midpoint of RT. Thus, XY is midsegment, parallel to ST, length half of ST. So ST = 2*XY = 14. So answer is C. 

But why does the angle matter? Because maybe there's a conflict? For example, if angle ZXY is 124 degrees, which relates to angle at T. Let me confirm that. As before, if XY is parallel to ST, and XZ is parallel to RT. So angle between XY and XZ is same as angle between ST and RT, which is angle at T. So angle ZXY = angle at T. So angle at T is 124 degrees. 

So, with RT = 13, ST = 14, angle at T = 124 degrees, we can check if this is consistent with the position of Z. 

Since Z is on TS, and if XZ is a midsegment, then Z must be the midpoint of TS. Therefore, TZ = ZS = ST / 2 = 14 / 2 = 7. 

But wait, the problem didn't mention anything about Z's position except lying on TS. So if Z is the midpoint of TS, then TZ = 7. 

Is there any inconsistency here? Let me check with coordinates again. Suppose ST = 14, angle at T is 124 degrees, RT = 13. Let me compute RS using the Law of Cosines. 

Law of Cosines: In triangle RST,

RS² = RT² + ST² - 2 * RT * ST * cos(angle at T)

Plugging numbers:

RS² = 13² + 14² - 2*13*14*cos(124°)

Calculate this value:

First, 13² = 169, 14² = 196. Sum is 169 + 196 = 365.

Then, 2*13*14 = 364.

cos(124°): Let me calculate that. 124 degrees is in the second quadrant. Cosine of 124° is negative. Let me approximate cos(124°):

Using calculator: cos(124°) ≈ cos(90+34) = -sin(34°) ≈ -0.5592. So approximately -0.5592.

Thus, the term becomes -364 * (-0.5592) = +364 * 0.5592 ≈ 364 * 0.5592 ≈ Let me compute 364 * 0.5 = 182, 364 * 0.0592 ≈ 364 * 0.06 ≈ 21.84. Total approx 182 + 21.84 = 203.84.

So RS² ≈ 365 + 203.84 ≈ 568.84. So RS ≈ sqrt(568.84) ≈ 23.85. 

But how does that relate to anything? Well, since X is the midpoint of RS, then RX = XS = RS / 2 ≈ 23.85 / 2 ≈ 11.92. 

But does this affect the problem? The problem doesn't require knowing RS. It just wants ST, which we've determined as 14, so answer C. 

But why does the problem give the angle? Maybe to confirm consistency? For example, if the angle wasn't compatible with the lengths, but in this case, it seems compatible. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Since XY and XZ are midsegments, and we have their lengths and the angle between them, perhaps using the Law of Cosines on triangle XYZ? 

Wait, triangle XYZ: we know XY = 7, XZ = ? (if it's a midsegment, then XZ is half RT = 13/2 = 6.5). Then angle between them is 124 degrees. Then, applying Law of Cosines on triangle XYZ, we can find YZ. But maybe that's unnecessary. 

But if XZ is a midsegment, then XZ = 13/2 = 6.5. Then, in triangle XYZ, sides XY = 7, XZ = 6.5, angle between them 124 degrees. So, by Law of Cosines, YZ² = 7² + (6.5)^2 - 2*7*6.5*cos(124°). Let me calculate this:

YZ² = 49 + 42.25 - 2*7*6.5*(-cos(124°))? Wait, no. Wait, Law of Cosines is c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(C). Here, angle between XY and XZ is 124 degrees. So YZ² = XY² + XZ² - 2*XY*XZ*cos(124°).

Plugging numbers:

YZ² = 7² + (6.5)^2 - 2*7*6.5*cos(124°)

Compute each part:

7² = 49

6.5² = 42.25

Sum: 49 + 42.25 = 91.25

Next term: 2*7*6.5 = 91

So, subtract 91 * cos(124°). Note that cos(124°) is negative, so this term becomes positive.

As before, cos(124°) ≈ -0.5592

So, 91 * (-0.5592) ≈ -50.8872

Therefore, total YZ² ≈ 91.25 - (-50.8872) = 91.25 + 50.8872 ≈ 142.1372

Thus, YZ ≈ sqrt(142.1372) ≈ 11.92. 

But what's YZ? Y is on RT, Z is on TS. Depending on the exact configuration, this might not directly impact ST. Unless there's another relation. But since we already derived ST as 14 through the midsegment logic, this seems consistent. 

Therefore, despite the angle given, the key relationship comes from the midsegments, leading to ST = 2 * XY = 14. Hence, answer C.

But let me check once more. Are there alternative interpretations where XY and XZ are not midsegments connecting midpoints of RS and RT, and midpoints of RS and TS? Like, maybe XY is a midsegment of another pair of sides?

Suppose instead that XY is the midsegment connecting midpoints of RT and ST. Then XY would be parallel to RS and half its length. So XY = 7 implies RS = 14. Then, XZ is another midsegment. Where could XZ be? Since X is on RS and Z is on TS. If XZ is a midsegment, it might connect midpoints of RS and RT, but then X is midpoint of RS and Z is midpoint of RT. But Z is supposed to be on TS. So that's conflicting. 

Alternatively, if XZ connects midpoints of RS and ST. Then X is midpoint of RS, Z is midpoint of ST. Then XZ is parallel to RT and half its length. So XZ = RT / 2 = 13 / 2 = 6.5. But the problem doesn't state the length of XZ. So this is possible. In this case, XY is midsegment connecting midpoints of RT and ST, so XY is parallel to RS and half its length. So RS = 2 * XY = 14. But the problem asks for ST. How do we find ST? We might need more info. 

But then, we have angle ZXY = 124 degrees. Let me think. In this scenario, X is midpoint of RS, Y is midpoint of RT, Z is midpoint of ST. Then, XY is parallel to RS, and XZ is parallel to RT. So, angle between XY and XZ is equal to angle between RS and RT. Which is angle at R. So angle ZXY = angle at R. But the problem says it's 124 degrees. So angle at R is 124 degrees. Then, with RS = 14, RT = 13, angle at R = 124 degrees, we can compute ST via Law of Cosines. 

Law of Cosines: ST² = RS² + RT² - 2*RS*RT*cos(angle R)

So ST² = 14² + 13² - 2*14*13*cos(124°)

Which is similar to what I computed earlier. Let me calculate that.

14² = 196, 13² = 169. Sum is 365.

Again, 2*14*13 = 364.

cos(124°) ≈ -0.5592.

So, ST² ≈ 365 - 364*(-0.5592) ≈ 365 + 364*0.5592 ≈ 365 + 203.8 ≈ 568.8. So ST ≈ sqrt(568.8) ≈ 23.85. Which is not among the answer choices. But the answer choices are 7, 13, 14, 20. None of these match. Therefore, this suggests that this interpretation is invalid. Hence, this means that the first interpretation where XY is midsegment connecting midpoints of RS and RT (so XY parallel to ST, length half of ST) is correct, giving ST = 14. This matches option C. 

Therefore, the correct answer is C. 14.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the length of $ ST $ in triangle $ \triangle RST $, we begin by analyzing the given constraints and leveraging the properties of **midsegments** in triangles.

---

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem

We are told:

- $ \text{Length}(RT) = 13 $
- $ \text{Length}(XY) = 7 $
- $ \angle ZXY = 124^\circ $
- Points $ Y \in \overleftrightarrow{RT} $, $ X \in \overleftrightarrow{RS} $, and $ Z \in \overleftrightarrow{TS} $
- Both $ XY $ and $ XZ $ are **midsegments** of triangle $ \triangle RST $

---

### Step 2: Properties of Midsegments

A **midsegment** of a triangle is a line segment that connects the **midpoints** of two sides and is **parallel** to the third side. Moreover, the length of a midsegment is **half** the length of the side it is parallel to.

Given that both $ XY $ and $ XZ $ are midsegments, this tells us that:

- $ XY $ connects the midpoints of two sides of the triangle.
- $ XZ $ connects the midpoints of two other sides.

Let’s identify the corresponding sides:

- Since $ X \in \overleftrightarrow{RS} $ and $ Y \in \overleftrightarrow{RT} $, the segment $ XY $ connects the **midpoint of $ RS $** and the **midpoint of $ RT $**, making it parallel to $ ST $.
- Since $ X \in \overleftrightarrow{RS} $ and $ Z \in \overleftrightarrow{TS} $, the segment $ XZ $ connects the **midpoint of $ RS $** and the **midpoint of $ TS $**, making it parallel to $ RT $.

This confirms that:

- $ XY \parallel ST $ and $ XY = \frac{1}{2} ST $
- $ XZ \parallel RT $ and $ XZ = \frac{1}{2} RT $

From this, we conclude:

$$
\text{Length}(XY) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \text{Length}(ST)
$$

---

### Step 3: Solving for $ ST $

We're given that:

$$
\text{Length}(XY) = 7
$$

Using the relationship above:

$$
7 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot ST \Rightarrow ST = 14
$$

---

### Step 4: Verifying Consistency with the Angle

The angle $ \angle ZXY = 124^\circ $ provides additional context. Since $ XY \parallel ST $ and $ XZ \parallel RT $, the angle $ \angle ZXY $ corresponds to the angle between the midsegments, which is equivalent to the angle between $ ST $ and $ RT $ — i.e., the angle at vertex $ T $ of triangle $ \triangle RST $. While this angle helps validate the configuration, it does **not affect** the computation of $ ST $, which is fully determined from the midsegment property.

---

### Final Conclusion

Based on the definition of midsegments and the given values, we find:

$$
ST = 2 \times XY = 2 \times 7 = 14
$$

Thus, the final answer is:

$$
\boxed{\text{C}}
$$
