MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, and C. Let me note down all the given information first.

First, the length of line AC is 21. Then, angle at point C (angle ACB) is 60 degrees. The measure of angle at point B (angle ABC) is 30 degrees. Wait, no—wait, the problem says MeasureOf(Angle(C, B, A)) which would be angle at B between points C, B, A. So that's angle ABC, right? So angle at B is 30 degrees. Also, lines AB and AC are perpendicular. Wait, Perpendicular(Line(A,B), Line(A,C)). So line AB is perpendicular to line AC. That means angle at A between AB and AC is 90 degrees. Hmm, so triangle ABC has a right angle at A?

Wait, but then angles at A, B, and C. Let me check again. If AB is perpendicular to AC, then angle at A is 90 degrees. Then angle at B is 30 degrees, and angle at C is 60 degrees. Wait, because the sum of angles in a triangle should be 180 degrees. So 90 + 30 + 60 = 180. Yes, that adds up. So triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at A, with angles 90°, 30°, 60°, and sides opposite these angles.

But wait, the side lengths. Let me recall the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle. In such a triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2, where the side opposite 30° is the shortest, then the side opposite 60°, then the hypotenuse opposite 90°.

But here, let's clarify which sides correspond to which angles. Since angle at A is 90°, the hypotenuse would be BC. Because in a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. So BC is the hypotenuse. Then angle at B is 30°, so the side opposite angle B is AC. And angle at C is 60°, so the side opposite angle C is AB.

So, in standard terms:

- Angle at A: 90°, so hypotenuse BC.
- Angle at B: 30°, so opposite side AC = 21 units.
- Angle at C: 60°, so opposite side AB = y (which is what we need to find).

In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are:

Opposite 30°: shortest leg = (hypotenuse)/2.

Opposite 60°: longer leg = (shortest leg)*√3.

Alternatively, since hypotenuse is twice the shorter leg.

But here, the side opposite 30° is AC = 21. Therefore, hypotenuse BC = 2 * AC = 42. But also, the side opposite 60° is AB, which is y. Which would be equal to (shorter leg)*√3. Wait, the shorter leg is AC (opposite 30°). So AB = AC * √3. Therefore, y = 21√3. So that would make option C.

Wait, but let me verify again. Let me draw the triangle mentally. Right angle at A. So AB and AC are the legs, and BC is the hypotenuse. Wait, but according to the given data, AC is 21. If angle at B is 30°, then the side opposite angle B is AC. So yes, AC is opposite angle B (which is 30°). Therefore, AC is the shorter leg. Hence, AB is the longer leg, adjacent to angle B. Therefore, AB = AC * tan(30°)? Wait, maybe I'm confusing something here.

Alternatively, using trigonometric ratios. For angle B, which is 30°, the opposite side is AC = 21. The hypotenuse is BC. So sin(angle B) = opposite / hypotenuse. So sin(30°) = 21 / BC. Therefore, BC = 21 / sin(30°) = 21 / 0.5 = 42. Then, cos(angle B) = adjacent / hypotenuse. Adjacent to angle B is AB. So cos(30°) = AB / BC. Therefore, AB = BC * cos(30°) = 42 * (√3/2) = 21√3. So yes, that gives AB = 21√3, which is option C.

Alternatively, since it's a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in ratio 1 : √3 : 2. Here, the side opposite 30° is AC = 21, which corresponds to the '1' part. Then the hypotenuse BC is 2*21=42, and the other leg AB is 21√3. So that confirms AB = 21√3. Therefore, the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me check once more for errors. The key was determining which sides correspond to which angles. Since angle at A is 90°, angles at B and C are 30° and 60°. The side opposite angle B (30°) is AC. So AC is the shorter leg. Then AB is the longer leg. Therefore, AB = AC * √3. So 21 * √3. So answer C.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be C, 21√3.
