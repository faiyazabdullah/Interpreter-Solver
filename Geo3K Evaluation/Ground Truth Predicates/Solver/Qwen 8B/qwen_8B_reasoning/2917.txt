MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, we have some geometric constraints here, and we need to find the value of TQ. The answer choices are A. 6, B. 7, C. 12, D. 18. Let me start by breaking down the information given.

First, let's list out all the given constraints:

1. Length of line QT is 2x - 6.
2. Length of line RS is 7.
3. Length of line QR is x + 3.
4. Length of line TS is 7.
5. Point S lies on line RT.
6. Point Q lies on line SA.
7. Lines SQ and ST are perpendicular.

We need to find TQ, which I assume refers to the length of segment QT, since TQ would be the same as QT. Wait, but maybe there's confusion here? Let me confirm. In geometry, segments are often denoted by their endpoints, so TQ is the same as QT. But the problem says "Find T Q." Maybe that's just a typo, and they mean QT? Or perhaps it's referring to coordinates? Hmm. Well, regardless, the key is that we need to find the length between points T and Q, which is given as 2x - 6. So our goal is to find the value of x first, then compute 2x - 6.

So, how do we find x?

Looking at the constraints, there are several lines mentioned. Let me try to visualize or sketch a rough diagram based on the given points and relationships.

Points involved: Q, R, S, T, A. Also, point S lies on line RT (from constraint 5). So line RT passes through S. Also, line SQ is perpendicular to line ST (constraint 7). That suggests that at point S, the lines SQ and ST form a right angle. Therefore, triangle SQT might be a right triangle? Wait, because SQ is perpendicular to ST, so angle at S is 90 degrees. So triangle SQT has a right angle at S. Therefore, by Pythagoras theorem, QT² = QS² + ST². 

But wait, we know that ST is given as 7 (constraint 4: LengthOf(Line(T, S)) is 7). Also, we can find QS if we can relate it to other lengths. However, we also have other constraints involving QR and RS.

Let me note down the variables again:

- QT = 2x - 6
- RS = 7
- QR = x + 3
- TS = 7 (so ST = 7)

Also, point S lies on RT. So S is somewhere along the line connecting R and T. So RT is a straight line passing through S. Additionally, point Q lies on line SA. Not sure yet about point A, but maybe it's not directly relevant unless needed for more relations.

Now, considering triangle SQT being right-angled at S. Then QT² = QS² + ST². Since ST is 7, then QT² = QS² + 49. But QT is given as 2x - 6. Therefore:

(2x - 6)^2 = QS^2 + 49.

So if we can find QS, then we can solve for x. Alternatively, maybe we can express QS in terms of other known quantities.

But how do we find QS? Let's think. We know QR is x + 3. Is there a way to relate QR and QS?

Wait, points Q, R, S... Are these colinear? Let me check. The problem states that point Q lies on line SA (constraint 6). But we don't know much about line SA except that Q is on it. So unless there's another relation, maybe we need to consider triangles or other relationships.

Alternatively, since S is on RT, maybe we can use coordinate geometry? Assign coordinates to the points and set up equations based on the given distances and perpendicularity.

Let me try that approach. Let's assign coordinates to make things easier.

Let me place point S at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since SQ is perpendicular to ST, and both emanate from S. Let me define coordinates such that:

- Let’s take S at (0, 0).

Since SQ is perpendicular to ST, suppose SQ is along the y-axis and ST is along the x-axis. Because they are perpendicular. So:

- Let’s say point Q is at (0, q) for some q, since SQ is vertical (along y-axis).
- Point T is at (t, 0) for some t, since ST is horizontal (along x-axis).

Then, line RT passes through S (since S is on RT). Points R and T are connected via line RT, which includes S. So point S divides RT into two parts: RS and ST. Given that ST is 7 units long, and RS is 7 units (given in constraint 2: LengthOf(Line(R, S)) is 7). Wait, RS is 7. So RS is the distance from R to S, which is 7. And ST is 7, the distance from S to T is 7. Therefore, RT is divided by S into two equal parts? Wait, no. If RS = 7 and ST = 7, then RT is RS + ST = 14? But only if S is between R and T. Which it is, since S lies on RT. So yes, RT is split into RS and ST, each 7 units. So RT has total length 14.

Therefore, points R and T are located such that S is between them, with SR=7 and ST=7. So if S is at (0,0), then T is at (7, 0) if we take direction along x-axis. Wait, earlier I considered T at (t, 0), but ST is 7. So if S is at (0,0), then T is at (7, 0) assuming positive x-direction. Similarly, R would be on the opposite side of S relative to T. So since S is between R and T, and RS = 7, then R would be at (-7, 0). Wait, but depending on direction. Let me clarify.

If S is between R and T, then moving from R to S to T. So vector from R to S is towards S, and from S to T is away. So if S is at (0,0), then T could be at (a, 0) and R at (-b, 0) such that the distance from R to S is b, and from S to T is a. Here, RS = 7, so b = 7. ST = 7, so a = 7. Hence, R would be at (-7, 0), S at (0,0), T at (7, 0). Thus, RT is from (-7, 0) to (7, 0), passing through S at (0,0). That makes sense.

Now, point Q is on line SA. Earlier, I had placed Q at (0, q) because SQ is along the y-axis. But line SA goes through Q. Wait, but where is point A? It's not specified. However, since Q lies on SA, but we don't know where A is. However, maybe we don't need to know A's location. Let me see.

But we also have QR = x + 3. So the distance from Q to R is x + 3. Since R is at (-7, 0) and Q is at (0, q), then QR can be computed using distance formula.

QR distance squared is [(-7 - 0)^2 + (0 - q)^2] = 49 + q². Therefore, QR = sqrt(49 + q²) = x + 3.

Additionally, we have QT, which is the distance from Q to T. Since T is at (7, 0) and Q is at (0, q), the distance QT squared is (7 - 0)^2 + (0 - q)^2 = 49 + q². Therefore, QT = sqrt(49 + q²). But according to the problem, QT = 2x - 6. So:

sqrt(49 + q²) = 2x - 6.

But from QR, we have sqrt(49 + q²) = x + 3. Therefore, equating these two expressions:

sqrt(49 + q²) = x + 3 and sqrt(49 + q²) = 2x - 6. Therefore,

x + 3 = 2x - 6 → solving for x:

Subtract x from both sides: 3 = x - 6 → x = 9.

Wait, but let me verify. If both expressions equal sqrt(49 + q²), then setting them equal gives x + 3 = 2x - 6 ⇒ x = 9. Then substituting back, QT = 2x - 6 = 2*9 -6 = 12. But let's check if that works with QR.

QR is x + 3 = 9 + 3 = 12. But QR is sqrt(49 + q²) = 12. Therefore, sqrt(49 + q²) = 12 ⇒ square both sides: 49 + q² = 144 ⇒ q² = 95 ⇒ q = sqrt(95). That seems okay. So x = 9, leading to QT = 12. So answer would be C. 12. But wait, let me check if there are any mistakes here.

Wait, but why did we assume that Q is on the y-axis? Because we set SQ as perpendicular to ST. Since SQ is perpendicular to ST, and we took ST along x-axis, SQ along y-axis. Therefore, Q is along the y-axis. Therefore, coordinates of Q are (0, q). Therefore, QR is from (-7, 0) to (0, q), and QT is from (0, q) to (7, 0). Both distances depend on q. But since both QR and QT are expressed in terms of sqrt(49 + q²), then QR equals QT? Wait, no. Wait, QR is sqrt(49 + q²) and QT is also sqrt(49 + q²). Therefore, QR equals QT? But according to the problem, QR is x + 3 and QT is 2x - 6. Therefore, setting them equal gives x + 3 = 2x - 6 ⇒ x = 9. Then QT = 2x -6 = 12. So answer is C. 12. But let me check if there are other constraints that may affect this.

Wait, but what about the position of point A? The problem mentions that point Q lies on line SA. But we didn't use that in our calculation. Did we miss something?

Hmm. Let me think. We assumed coordinates for Q as (0, q), but does that necessarily satisfy that Q lies on SA? Well, since we defined line SA as passing through Q. But without knowing where A is, we can't determine anything else. However, since we didn't need to involve point A in our previous reasoning, perhaps that condition is redundant or already satisfied by our setup. For example, since Q is on SA, and we've fixed Q's coordinates, but A could be anywhere along the line extending from S through Q. However, since we didn't get any additional constraints involving A, maybe that condition is automatically satisfied once we fix Q's coordinates. So perhaps our previous reasoning holds.

Another thing to check: Perpendicularity. We said that SQ is perpendicular to ST. In our coordinate system, SQ is vertical (from (0,0) to (0,q)), and ST is horizontal (from (0,0) to (7,0)). These are indeed perpendicular. So that condition is satisfied.

So all constraints seem to be satisfied with x = 9. Then TQ is 2x -6 = 12, which is option C. So answer should be C. 12.

But let me check again for errors. Suppose x = 9. Then QR = x +3 = 12. Which matches sqrt(49 + q²) = 12. So q² = 144 -49 = 95. So q = sqrt(95). That's fine. There's no contradiction here. All given lengths hold. Also, RS is 7, which is the distance from R (-7,0) to S (0,0): sqrt((0 - (-7))^2 + (0 - 0)^2) = 7. Correct. ST is 7, distance from S (0,0) to T (7,0): 7. Correct. QT is 12. Correct. So everything checks out.

Therefore, the answer should be C. 12. So Final Answer: C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the geometric constraints and identifying the relationships between the points and lines. The key steps involve interpreting the perpendicularity, applying the Pythagorean Theorem, and using the given distances to derive an equation for $ x $. Finally, we calculate the desired quantity, $ TQ $, based on the derived value of $ x $.

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**

From the given conditions:
- $ \text{Length}(QT) = 2x - 6 $
- $ \text{Length}(RS) = 7 $
- $ \text{Length}(QR) = x + 3 $
- $ \text{Length}(TS) = 7 $
- Point $ S $ lies on line $ RT $
- Point $ Q $ lies on line $ SA $
- $ \angle SQ \perp \angle ST $

This implies that triangle $ \triangle SQT $ is a **right triangle** at point $ S $, with legs $ SQ $ and $ ST $, and hypotenuse $ QT $.

Thus, by the **Pythagorean Theorem**, we write:
$$
QT^2 = SQ^2 + ST^2
$$

Given that $ ST = 7 $, and $ QT = 2x - 6 $, we substitute into the equation:
$$
(2x - 6)^2 = SQ^2 + 7^2
\Rightarrow (2x - 6)^2 = SQ^2 + 49
$$

---

### **Step 2: Use Other Constraints to Find $ SQ $**

We are also told:
- $ \text{Length}(QR) = x + 3 $

Assume coordinates to simplify the geometry:
- Place $ S $ at the origin $ (0, 0) $
- Since $ \angle SQ \perp \angle ST $, align $ SQ $ vertically and $ ST $ horizontally
- Let $ Q = (0, q) $, $ T = (7, 0) $, and $ R = (-7, 0) $

Now compute $ QR $ using the distance formula:
$$
QR = \sqrt{(q - 0)^2 + (0 - (-7))^2} = \sqrt{q^2 + 49}
$$

Equating this with the given expression for $ QR $:
$$
\sqrt{q^2 + 49} = x + 3
$$

Similarly, compute $ QT $:
$$
QT = \sqrt{(7 - 0)^2 + (0 - q)^2} = \sqrt{49 + q^2}
$$

Set this equal to the given expression for $ QT $:
$$
\sqrt{49 + q^2} = 2x - 6
$$

---

### **Step 3: Solve the System of Equations**

From above, we have:
1. $ \sqrt{49 + q^2} = x + 3 $
2. $ \sqrt{49 + q^2} = 2x - 6 $

Setting the two expressions equal:
$$
x + 3 = 2x - 6
\Rightarrow x = 9
$$

Now plug $ x = 9 $ into either expression for $ QT $:
$$
TQ = 2x - 6 = 2(9) - 6 = 18 - 6 = 12
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

All constraints are satisfied under the assumption of perpendicularity and consistent placement of points. The final value of $ TQ $ is $ 12 $, which corresponds to **option C**.

$$
\boxed{\text{Final Answer: C}}
$$
