MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out the measure of angle 2 here. First, I need to visualize the diagram based on the given constraints. Let me note down all the information provided.

We have points A, B, C, D, E. The angles mentioned involve these points. Let me list out the given equalities:

1. Angle at AED (Angle(A, E, D)) equals angle 1.
2. Angle at BEC (Angle(B, E, C)) equals angle 2.
3. Angle at CBA (Angle(C, B, A)) is 55 degrees.
4. Angle at DCB (Angle(D, C, B)) equals angle 3.
5. Angle at EDA (Angle(E, D, A)) is 47 degrees.
6. Angle at DAB (Angle(D, A, B)) is 57 degrees.
Additionally, point E lies on line AB and also on line DC.

So first, maybe drawing a rough sketch would help. Since E is on both AB and DC, that suggests lines AB and DC intersect at point E. So, imagine two lines AB and DC crossing at E. Points A, B are on line AB, and points D, C are on line DC. Wait, but how do they connect? Maybe there's a quadrilateral involved?

Wait, perhaps ABCD is a quadrilateral with diagonals intersecting at E? Or maybe it's some other configuration. Alternatively, since E is on AB and DC, so AB and DC are two lines intersecting at E. Then points A, B are on one line, D, C on another. But then where are points C and D connected? Maybe forming triangles?

Alternatively, think about triangle relationships. For example, angle at CBA is 55°, which is angle at B between points C, B, A. Also, angle at DAB is 57°, which is angle at A between D, A, B. And angle at EDA is 47°, which is angle at D between E, D, A. Also, angle at EDA is part of triangle EDA?

Let me try to reconstruct step by step.

First, since E is on AB and DC, we can consider AB as a straight line with E somewhere between A and B. Similarly, DC is another straight line passing through E. Therefore, lines AB and DC intersect at E. So, points A and B are on line AB, with E lying between them. Points D and C are on line DC, with E between them as well. So, the lines AB and DC cross at E.

Now, considering triangle EDA: angle at D is 47°, which is angle EDA. Also, angle at A is DAB = 57°, which is angle between DA and AB. Wait, angle DAB is at point A, between points D, A, B. So DA connects to A and goes to D, and AB connects to A and goes to B. So DA and AB form angle DAB at point A, which is given as 57°. 

Similarly, angle EDA is at point D between E, D, A. That would be part of triangle EDA. In triangle EDA, we know angle at D is 47°, angle at A is 57°, so we can find angle at E. Because the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°. So angle at E in triangle EDA would be 180 - 47 - 57 = 76 degrees. So angle DEA is 76°, right?

But wait, angle DEA is part of the larger picture. Now, since E is on AB and DC, maybe there are other triangles or angles we can use.

Also, angle CBA is 55°, which is angle at B between points C, B, A. So that's angle ABC. Wait, angle CBA is angle at B, so that's part of triangle ABC. If we can find more angles in that triangle, maybe we can relate them.

Moreover, angle at BEC is angle 2. So angle at E between B, E, C. Which is part of triangle BEC. So maybe we can find relations using vertical angles, supplementary angles, or triangle properties.

Let me try to map out the diagram again. Points A and B are on line AB with E between them. Points D and C are on line DC with E between them. So lines AB and DC cross at E. So, connecting points to form other figures. Perhaps triangles ADE, BEC, etc.

Given that, let's look at triangle EDA: angles at D=47°, at A=57°, so angle at E is 76°, as above. Therefore, angle DEA is 76°, which is the same as angle AEB? Wait, no. Because E is on AB, so angle DEA is adjacent to angle AEB? Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Since E is on AB, then AE is part of AB. So, looking at angle DEA: at point E, between D and A. Wait, angle DEA is at point E? No, angle DEA is at point D, between E, D, A. So that's angle at D. Wait, earlier I thought that angle EDA is at D, which is part of triangle EDA. Yes, angle EDA is at D, between E, D, A. So that's angle at D. So in triangle EDA, angles are:

At D: 47°, at A: 57°, so angle at E (which is angle DEA) is 180 - 47 - 57 = 76°, yes. So angle DEA is 76°, which is the angle at E between D and A. But since E is on AB, then EA is part of AB. Therefore, angle DEA is formed by ED and EA. So ED is going from E to D, and EA is along AB towards A. So that angle is 76°.

Now, considering line DC passes through E, so EC is part of DC beyond E. So, from E, moving along DC towards C. Therefore, EC is a segment extending from E to C. Similarly, ED is from E to D. So, ED and EC are parts of line DC, with E between D and C. Therefore, ED and EC are opposite directions along DC.

Therefore, in triangle EDC? Wait, but we don't have much info about that yet. However, angle at D is 47°, which is angle EDA. Wait, angle EDA is part of triangle EDA, but maybe there's something else.

Now, looking at angle CBA = 55°, which is at point B between points C, B, A. So that's angle ABC. So in triangle ABC, angle at B is 55°, and we might need to find other angles.

But how does point E come into play here? Since E is on AB and DC. So, connecting E to C and E to D, but already those lines exist.

Perhaps considering triangle BEC. We need angle 2, which is angle BEC. To find that, maybe we can find other angles around point E.

Earlier, we found angle DEA is 76°, which is at point E between D and A. Since E is on AB, then angle DEA is adjacent to angle AEB? Wait, because AB is a straight line. At point E, there are several angles. Let me think.

At point E, since it's on AB, the straight line AB has angles on either side. But since E is also on DC, which is another line. So, at point E, there are four angles: around the intersection of AB and DC. These would be vertical angles. So, for instance, angle between AB and DC at E would create two pairs of vertical angles.

If we consider line AB and DC intersecting at E, then the vertical angles would be:

- angle AED and angle BEC (opposite each other)

- angle AEC and angle DEB (another pair)

Wait, perhaps I should label all angles at point E.

So, when two lines intersect, they form two pairs of vertical angles. Let me denote:

- The angle between EA and ED is angle AED (which we found earlier as 76°). Wait, no. Earlier, we considered angle EDA (at D), but angle at E between A and D would be different. Wait, confusion arises here. Let me re-express.

When dealing with angles, the middle letter is the vertex. So, angle AED is at point E, between points A, E, D. So that's the angle between EA and ED. Similarly, angle BEC is at point E, between points B, E, C. So that's the angle between EB and EC.

Since lines AB and DC intersect at E, then angle AED and angle BEC are vertical angles. Because when two lines intersect, vertical angles are equal. Therefore, angle AED equals angle BEC. So angle AED is 76°, as calculated from triangle EDA. Therefore, angle BEC (which is angle 2) is also 76°. Wait, but that would make angle 2 equal to 76°, which is option D. But let me check if that's correct.

Wait, hold on. How did we get angle AED as 76°? Earlier, in triangle EDA, we had angles at D (EDA) = 47°, at A (DAB?) Wait, no. Let me recheck that.

In triangle EDA, the vertices are E, D, A. Therefore, the angles are:

At D: angle EDA = 47° (given).

At A: angle DAE. What is angle DAE? That is the angle at point A between D, A, E. But angle DAB is given as 57°, which is the angle at A between D, A, B. Since E is on AB, then angle DAE is part of angle DAB. Specifically, angle DAE is the same as angle DAB, because E is on AB. Wait, no. Because DAB is the angle between DA and AB. Since E is on AB, then DA forms an angle with AB at point A, which is angle DAB. So, angle DAE is the same as angle DAB, because E is on AB. Therefore, angle DAE is 57°, as given.

Therefore, in triangle EDA, angles are:

At D: 47°, at A: 57°, so angle at E (which is angle AED) is 180 - 47 - 57 = 76°, yes. So angle AED is 76°, which is vertical to angle BEC. Hence, angle BEC (which is angle 2) is also 76°, making the answer D. But wait, the answer choices include D as 76. But let me confirm once again.

However, there's another possibility. Maybe angle AED isn't the vertical angle to angle BEC. Let me visualize again. When two lines cross, the vertical angles are across from each other. So, if you have lines AB and DC intersecting at E, then the vertical angles would be:

- Between EA and ED, and between EB and EC.

Wait, perhaps angle AED is one vertical angle, and angle BEC is its vertical counterpart. So yes, angle AED and angle BEC are vertical angles, hence equal. Therefore, angle BEC is 76°, which would be angle 2. So answer D.

But let me check if there are other constraints that could affect this. For example, maybe triangle BEC relates to other angles?

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me see.

Another way to approach: since angle AED is 76°, which is vertical to angle BEC, so angle 2 is 76°, which is option D. But let me check if there are other angles that need to be considered.

Looking back at the problem statement, there are other angles mentioned: angle at CBA is 55°, angle at DCB is angle 3, which is equal to angle DCB. Also, angle at DAB is 57°, which we've used. Are there other triangles or relationships?

For example, looking at triangle ABC: we know angle at B is 55°, angle at A is... Well, angle at A in triangle ABC would be angle CAB. But angle CAB is part of angle DAB, which is 57°. Wait, unless D is related to triangle ABC. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle BEC. If we can find other angles in that triangle, we can verify angle 2. Let's try that.

In triangle BEC, we need to find angle at E (which is angle 2). To find that, we need to know other angles in the triangle. Let's see if we can find angles at B or C.

But angle at B in triangle BEC is angle EBC. Is that known? Let's see. Angle CBA is 55°, which is angle at B between C, B, A. Since E is on AB, then angle EBC is the same as angle CBA, because E lies on AB. Wait, no. Because angle CBA is the entire angle at B between C, B, A. But E is a point on AB. So, if we consider triangle BEC, angle at B is between E, B, C. Which is the same as angle CBA. So angle EBC is equal to angle CBA, which is 55°. Therefore, in triangle BEC, angle at B is 55°, angle at E is angle 2, and angle at C is ?

To find angle at C, we need more information. However, angle at C is angle ECB. Is there a way to find that?

Looking at line DC, which passes through E. So, point C is on DC. So, angle at C involving point B? Maybe considering triangle DCB? Wait, angle DCB is angle 3, which is given. Let me recall: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D, C, B)), MeasureOf(angle 3)). So angle DCB is angle at C between D, C, B. So that's angle DCB, which is part of triangle DCB.

But how does that relate to triangle BEC?

Well, if we can find angle at C in triangle BEC, which is angle ECB, then we can use the fact that angles in triangle BEC add up to 180°. So:

angle EBC + angle ECB + angle BEC = 180°

We know angle EBC is 55°, angle BEC is angle 2, and angle ECB is ?

But angle ECB is part of angle DCB. Because angle DCB is at point C between D, C, B. Since E is on DC, then angle ECB is the same as angle DCB? Wait, no. Let me think.

Point E is on DC, so line EC is part of DC. Therefore, angle at C between D, C, B is angle DCB. But point E is on DC, so angle DCB is the angle between DC and CB. Since EC is a segment of DC, then angle DCB is the same as angle ECB. Because EC is along DC. So angle DCB (angle at C between D, C, B) is equal to angle ECB. Therefore, angle ECB is equal to angle DCB, which is angle 3. But we don't know angle 3 yet. However, perhaps we can find angle 3 from other information?

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to relate angle 3 with other angles. Let me check.

Looking at triangle DCB. In triangle DCB, we know angle at C is angle DCB (angle 3), and we might need other angles. But do we have enough information?

Alternatively, looking at triangle EDC. Wait, but we don't have much info about that. However, angle at D in triangle EDC would be angle EDC. Which is angle at D between E, D, C. But earlier, we had angle EDA = 47°, which is angle at D between E, D, A. Since points A and C are on different sides of line DC? Wait, no. Line DC passes through E. So, depending on the positions of A and C relative to E.

Wait, earlier, we said that E is on DC. So, points D and C are on line DC with E between them. So, from point D, moving through E to C. Therefore, angle EDA is at D between E, D, A. So, DA is connected to D, and EA is connected to A. So, DA is a separate line from DC. So, angle EDA is between ED (part of DC) and DA.

But angle at D in triangle EDC would be angle EDC, which is between ED and DC. But since DC continues past E to C, angle EDC is 180° minus angle ADC? Not sure. Maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe considering that angle EDA is 47°, and angle ADC is something else. Wait, not sure.

But let me return to triangle BEC. If I can express angle ECB (which is angle DCB = angle 3) in terms of other angles. Suppose we can find angle 3.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to find angle 3 using triangle EDC or something else.

Wait, let's think about line DC. Since E is on DC, and we have point A connected to D. So, maybe triangle ADC? Let me think.

In triangle ADC, we have points A, D, C. We know angle at D (EDA) is 47°, which is angle between ED and DA. Also, angle at A is DAB = 57°, which is angle between DA and AB. But AB and DC meet at E. So, perhaps angle at A in triangle ADC is angle DAC. Wait, angle DAC is the same as angle DAB? No, because DAB is the angle between DA and AB. But angle DAC would be the angle between DA and AC. Unless AC is connected. Wait, maybe not directly.

This seems getting too complicated. Let me go back to the key point: angle AED is 76°, which is vertical to angle BEC. So angle BEC is 76°, making angle 2 equal to 76°, which is option D. But why am I hesitating? Because sometimes diagrams can have unexpected configurations. Let me check again.

Is angle AED indeed vertical to angle BEC? When two lines intersect, the vertical angles are the ones opposite each other. So, if lines AB and DC intersect at E, then:

- The angle between AB and DC at E, on one side, is angle AED (between EA and ED), and the vertical angle would be the angle between EB and EC, which is angle BEC. Yes! So angle AED and angle BEC are vertical angles. Hence, they are equal. Therefore, angle BEC (which is angle 2) is equal to angle AED, which we calculated as 76°. Thus, answer D.

But let me check if there's any conflicting information. For example, suppose angle 2 is 76°, but there's another constraint that makes it different. Let me check other given angles.

Given angle CBA is 55°, angle DAB is 57°, angle EDA is 47°, and angle at EDA was used in triangle EDA. All of these seem consistent. There's no mention of other angles that would conflict with this conclusion. Therefore, unless there's an error in assuming vertical angles, this should be correct.

Wait, but another possible mistake: maybe angle AED is not the vertical angle. Let me re-examine the angles at point E.

Imagine two lines AB and CD intersecting at E. The angles formed are:

1. Between EA and ED: angle AED
2. Between ED and EB: angle DEB
3. Between EB and EC: angle BEC
4. Between EC and EA: angle AEC

Vertical angles are angle AED and angle BEC; angle DEB and angle AEC. Therefore, yes, angle AED and angle BEC are vertical angles, so they are equal. Therefore, angle BEC = angle AED = 76°, hence angle 2 is 76°, so answer D.

Thus, the correct answer should be D. However, let me check if there's another approach that leads to a different answer, just to be safe.

Alternative approach: Using the fact that the sum of angles around point E is 360°. At point E, the angles around it are:

- angle AED (76°)
- angle DEB
- angle BEC (angle 2)
- angle AEC

These four angles add up to 360°. However, without knowing other angles, it's hard to proceed. But if we assume angle AED = angle BEC = 76°, then the remaining angles (DEB and AEC) would add up to 360 - 76 -76 = 208°. But unless we have more info, we can't determine them individually. But since our previous reasoning holds, this seems okay.

Another thing to check: Could there be a typo in the question? Like, angle 1 and angle 2 being different? But according to the problem, angle 1 is equal to angle AED (which is 76°), and angle 2 is equal to angle BEC (also 76°). But the answer choices have D as 76. So unless there's a miscalculation in the triangle angles.

Wait, let me recalculate the angles in triangle EDA. Given angle at D is 47°, angle at A is 57°, so angle at E is 180 - 47 - 57 = 76°. Correct. So that's solid.

Hence, the answer should be D. 76°.

But wait, looking at the answer choices, option D is 76. So Final Answer: D.
