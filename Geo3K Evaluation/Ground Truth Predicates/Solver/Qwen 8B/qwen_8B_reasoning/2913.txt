MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points D, C, B, and maybe others? Let me read the problem again carefully.

The problem says:

Given that the length of line DC is equal to x. The length of line BD is 14, and the length of BC is 10. Also, line DC is perpendicular to line BC. We need to find x.

Wait, so there are four points mentioned here: D, C, B, and maybe another point? Wait, no, the lines mentioned are DC, BD, BC. So points involved are B, C, D. But how are they arranged?

Let me visualize this. Since DC is perpendicular to BC, that suggests that at point C, the lines DC and BC form a right angle. So point C is connected to both B and D, and DC is perpendicular to BC. Therefore, triangle BCD has a right angle at C? Wait, because DC is perpendicular to BC, which would mean that angle at C between BC and DC is 90 degrees. So triangle BCD is a right-angled triangle with right angle at C. Then BD is the hypotenuse of this triangle, since it connects points B and D. 

So, in triangle BCD, right-angled at C, BC = 10, DC = x, and BD = 14. Therefore, by Pythagoras theorem, BD² = BC² + DC². Therefore, substituting the values:

BD² = BC² + DC²  
=> 14² = 10² + x²  
Calculating that: 196 = 100 + x²  
Subtracting 100 from both sides: x² = 96  
Therefore, x = sqrt(96)  
Simplify sqrt(96): sqrt(16*6) = 4*sqrt(6). 

Looking at the answer choices, option D is 4√6. So that should be the answer. Let me check my steps again.

First, confirming the triangle setup. If DC is perpendicular to BC, then yes, triangle BCD is right-angled at C. Therefore, BD is the hypotenuse. Then applying Pythagoras correctly. Calculations: 14 squared is indeed 196, 10 squared is 100, difference is 96. Square root of 96 simplifies to 4√6. So the answer should be D.

But wait, just making sure I didn't mix up any points. For example, could there be another configuration? Suppose the points aren't in the order I thought. Like, maybe D isn't connected directly to B? But the problem mentions Line(D,C), Line(B,D), Line(B,C). So points are connected as follows: D connected to C, B connected to D, B connected to C. So forming triangle BCD with right angle at C. Yes, that seems correct. Therefore, my reasoning holds.

Another way to think: coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to verify. Let’s place point C at (0,0). Since BC is a line, and DC is perpendicular to BC. Let me assume BC is along the x-axis. So point B is at (10, 0), since BC = 10 units. Then point C is at (0,0). Now, DC is perpendicular to BC. Since BC is horizontal, DC must be vertical. So DC is vertical, meaning point D is somewhere along the y-axis. Let me say point D is at (0, y), but since DC is from D to C, which is from (0,y) to (0,0), so DC length is |y|. So DC = x = |y|.

Now, BD is the distance from B(10,0) to D(0,y). That distance is sqrt((10-0)^2 + (0 - y)^2) = sqrt(100 + y²). According to the problem, BD is 14, so sqrt(100 + y²) = 14. Squaring gives 100 + y² = 196 => y² = 96 => y = sqrt(96) = 4√6. Hence x is 4√6, which matches option D. So that confirms it.

Therefore, the correct answer is D.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we begin by interpreting the geometric relationships described in the problem:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Configuration**

We are told:

- $ \text{Length}(DC) = x $
- $ \text{Length}(BC) = 10 $
- $ \text{Length}(BD) = 14 $
- $ \overline{DC} \perp \overline{BC} $

This implies that triangle $ \triangle BCD $ is a **right triangle**, with the right angle at point $ C $. In such a triangle:

- $ \angle C = 90^\circ $
- $ BC $ and $ DC $ are the legs
- $ BD $ is the hypotenuse

---

### **Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**

Using the Pythagorean Theorem for the right triangle $ \triangle BCD $:

$$
BD^2 = BC^2 + DC^2
$$

Substitute the known lengths:

$$
14^2 = 10^2 + x^2 \\
196 = 100 + x^2
$$

Solving for $ x^2 $:

$$
x^2 = 196 - 100 = 96
$$

Take the square root:

$$
x = \sqrt{96}
$$

Simplify the radical:

$$
\sqrt{96} = \sqrt{16 \cdot 6} = 4\sqrt{6}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Match with Answer Choices**

From the given options:

- A. $ 4\sqrt{2} $
- B. $ 4\sqrt{3} $
- C. $ 8 $
- D. $ 4\sqrt{6} $

Our computed value is $ x = 4\sqrt{6} $, which corresponds to **Option D**.

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\text{D}}
$$
