MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, and C. The given information includes that the length of line AC is 6 units. Also, angle at point B (angle ABC) is 30 degrees. Additionally, lines AB and AC are perpendicular. Wait, hold on—wait, the problem says Perpendicular(Line(A,B), Line(A,C)). So that means AB is perpendicular to AC? Let me confirm that. 

So, if AB and AC are perpendicular, then triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at point A. Because the two lines AB and AC meet at point A, so the right angle is at A. But wait, the angle given is angle at B, which is angle ABC. Hmm, maybe I need to draw a diagram mentally.

Let me sketch it out. Points A, B, C. Since AB and AC are perpendicular, they form a right angle at A. Therefore, triangle ABC has a right angle at A. Then angle at B is 30 degrees. Wait, but in a right-angled triangle, the angles other than the right angle add up to 90 degrees. So if angle at B is 30 degrees, then angle at C would be 60 degrees. 

But let me check again. The angle given is angle(C, B, A), which is angle at B between points C, B, A. So that's angle ABC. So in triangle ABC, angle at B is 30 degrees. And since AB is perpendicular to AC, meaning that angle at A is 90 degrees. Therefore, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with right angle at A, angle at B is 30 degrees, so angle at C is 60 degrees. 

Now, the sides: AC is given as 6 units. Let me recall the trigonometric ratios for a right-angled triangle. In such triangles, the sides can be related using sine, cosine, tangent. Let's label the sides. 

In triangle ABC, right-angled at A. So side opposite to angle B (which is 30 degrees) is AC. Wait, no. Let me think. Let me define:

- Right angle at A, so sides AB and AC are the legs, and BC is the hypotenuse.

Angle at B is 30 degrees. So in triangle ABC, angle at B = 30°, angle at A = 90°, so angle at C = 60°.

Therefore, the sides:

Opposite angle B (30°): that's side AC. Because angle B is at vertex B, so the side opposite to angle B is AC. Wait, yes. In triangle ABC, each angle is opposite the corresponding side. So:

- Angle at A (right angle) is opposite side BC (hypotenuse).
- Angle at B is 30°, opposite side AC.
- Angle at C is 60°, opposite side AB.

Wait, so if angle B is 30°, then the side opposite to it is AC. Given that AC = 6. So AC is opposite angle B. Therefore, in terms of trigonometry, sin(angle B) equals opposite over hypotenuse. Wait, but maybe better to use tan(angle B) = opposite / adjacent.

Alternatively, let's consider the sides. Let me denote:

AB = y (given)

AC = 6 (given)

BC = ?

Since it's a right-angled triangle at A, Pythagoras theorem applies: AB² + AC² = BC².

Also, using trigonometric ratios. For angle B (30°), the opposite side is AC = 6, adjacent side is AB = y, and hypotenuse is BC.

So tan(angle B) = opposite / adjacent = AC / AB = 6 / y.

But angle B is 30°, so tan(30°) = 6 / y.

We know that tan(30°) is 1/√3. Therefore,

1/√3 = 6/y → solving for y gives y = 6 * √3.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So y = 6√3. Which is option C.

But let me verify once more. Alternatively, using sine. For angle B, sin(30°) = opposite / hypotenuse = AC / BC. So sin(30°) = 6 / BC. Since sin(30°) = 1/2, so 1/2 = 6 / BC → BC = 12. Then, using Pythagoras: AB² + AC² = BC² → AB² + 6² = 12² → AB² = 144 - 36 = 108 → AB = sqrt(108) = sqrt(36*3) = 6√3. Yep, same result. So y is 6√3. Hence, the answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't mix up the sides. Let me recheck. If angle at B is 30°, then the side opposite to angle B is AC. So AC is opposite angle B. So yes, that's correct. So tan(30°)= AC / AB → 6 / y. So y=6 / tan(30°). Since tan(30°)=1/√3, then y=6/(1/√3)=6√3. Correct. So answer is C. So the correct choice is C, which is 6√3. Therefore, Final Answer: C.

To determine the value of $ y $, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration described in the problem.

### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry

We are given three key pieces of information:

- **$ \text{Length}(AC) = 6 $**
- **$ \text{Measure}(\angle ABC) = 30^\circ $**
- **Lines $ AB $ and $ AC $ are perpendicular**

From these, we infer that triangle $ ABC $ is a **right triangle** with a **right angle at point A**, because $ AB \perp AC $. This makes $ \angle A = 90^\circ $. Thus, the triangle is a **right-angled triangle** at $ A $, with:

- $ \angle A = 90^\circ $
- $ \angle B = 30^\circ $
- $ \angle C = 60^\circ $

This is a classic **30-60-90 triangle**, where the sides are in the ratio:

$$
\text{opposite } 30^\circ : \text{opposite } 60^\circ : \text{hypotenuse} = 1 : \sqrt{3} : 2
$$

---

### Step 2: Applying Trigonometric Ratios

In triangle $ ABC $:

- Side $ AC $ lies opposite angle $ B $ (30°), so it corresponds to the **shorter leg**.
- Side $ AB $ lies adjacent to angle $ B $, and is the **longer leg**.
- Hypotenuse is $ BC $.

Given:
- $ AC = 6 $ (opposite $ 30^\circ $)
- We are to find $ AB = y $ (adjacent to $ 30^\circ $)

Using the **tangent function**:
$$
\tan(30^\circ) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{AC}{AB}
$$

Substitute known values:
$$
\tan(30^\circ) = \frac{6}{y}
$$

Recall that:
$$
\tan(30^\circ) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
$$

Set up the equation:
$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{6}{y}
$$

Solving for $ y $:
$$
y = 6 \cdot \sqrt{3}
$$

---

### Step 3: Conclusion

Thus, the value of $ y $ is:

$$
\boxed{6\sqrt{3}}
$$

This matches **Option C**.

### Final Answer:  
**C. $ 6\sqrt{3} $**
