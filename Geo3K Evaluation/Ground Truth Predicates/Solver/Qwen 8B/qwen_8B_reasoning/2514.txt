====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to visualize the figure based on the given constraints. Let me start by listing out all the information provided:

1. The length of line segment IH is 1 unit. So, |IH| = 1.
2. Point H lies on the line IG. That means points I, H, and G are colinear with H somewhere between I and G? Or maybe H could be extended beyond?
3. Point K lies on the line segment GJ. Wait, no—the constraint says "PointLiesOnLine(K, Line(G, J))", so K is on line GJ, which might mean it's anywhere along that line, not necessarily between G and J.
4. Lines HK and IJ are parallel. So, Line(HK) || Line(IJ).

We need to find the length of KJ, given that GJ = 8 and GH = 12. Also, HI = 4? Wait, wait—Hold on. The first constraint says Equals(LengthOf(Line(I, H)), 1). So, that would make |IH| = 1. But then there's another part saying GH = 12. Wait, that seems conflicting because if I and H are connected with length 1, but GH is 12. Maybe I need to draw this out.

Let me sketch mentally. Points I, H, G are colinear since H lies on line IG. So, the order could be I---H---G, or maybe H is between I and G, or perhaps H is on the extension beyond I or G. But given that GH = 12 and IH = 1, let's assume they are in a straight line. Let me think about coordinates.

Let me assign coordinates to these points to make it easier. Let's set point I at (0, 0). Since IH is 1 unit, and assuming they're colinear, let me place H at (1, 0). Then, since H lies on line IG, G is somewhere along the line extending from I through H. Given that GH = 12, so the distance between G and H is 12. If H is at (1, 0), then G would be located at (1 + 12, 0) = (13, 0)? Wait, but direction matters. If H is between I and G, then moving from I to H to G. So, from I(0,0) to H(1,0) to G(1 + 12, 0) = (13, 0). So, the coordinates would be I(0,0), H(1,0), G(13,0). Then, the length of IG is 13 units, right?

But then we have another condition: Parallel(Line(H,K), Line(I,J)). So, lines HK and IJ are parallel. Also, K lies on line GJ. Let me see. We need to find KJ. Given that GJ is 8 units long. Wait, GJ is given as 8. So, the length of segment GJ is 8. Wait, but where is point J? Because we also have line IJ being parallel to HK.

Hmm, maybe I should consider coordinates for J. Let me think. Let me assume that line GJ has some coordinates. Let me suppose that point J is somewhere such that line GJ has length 8. But without knowing the exact position, maybe I need to use similar triangles or something else.

Wait, since lines HK and IJ are parallel, maybe we can use the concept of similar triangles here. Let me recall that if two lines are parallel, then corresponding angles are equal, leading to similar triangles.

Alternatively, using vectors or coordinate geometry.

Let me proceed with coordinates again. Let me fix coordinate system.

Set I at (0,0), H at (1,0), as before. Then G is at (13,0). Now, we need to define points J and K.

Point K is on line GJ. Let me denote coordinates for J. Let me assume that J is at some point (x,y), but since we don't know its location yet, maybe I need more constraints.

Also, line IJ is parallel to line HK. So, vector IJ is parallel to vector HK.

Let me write down coordinates for K. Since K lies on line GJ. Let me parametrize line GJ. Let me suppose that J is a point such that GJ = 8. But since we don't know the direction of GJ, maybe I need to express variables.

Wait, but maybe there's another way. Let me think about ratios.

Since lines HK and IJ are parallel, then the triangles formed may be similar. Alternatively, using intercept theorem (Thales' theorem).

But first, let me check if there are any other relations. Let me note that GH = 12, which we've already placed as the distance between G(13,0) and H(1,0): yes, that's 12 units. Correct.

Now, the problem is to find KJ, given that GJ = 8. So, once we find coordinates for J and K, we can compute the distance between them.

But how do we determine J's coordinates? Since line IJ is parallel to HK.

Let me think. Let me denote coordinates for J as (a,b). Then, the line IJ goes from I(0,0) to J(a,b). The direction vector of IJ is (a, b).

Similarly, line HK goes from H(1,0) to K. Since K is on line GJ, which connects G(13,0) to J(a,b). Let me parametrize K.

Parametrize line GJ: starting at G(13,0) going towards J(a,b). Let me write parametric equations. For parameter t ∈ [0,1], the points on line GJ are (13 + t(a - 13), 0 + t(b - 0)) = (13 + t(a-13), tb). Therefore, point K can be represented as (13 + t(a-13), tb) for some t.

So, coordinates of K: x_K = 13 + t(a -13), y_K = tb.

Then, vector HK is (x_K - 1, y_K - 0) = (13 + t(a -13) -1, tb) = (12 + t(a -13), tb).

Vector IJ is (a - 0, b - 0) = (a, b).

Since lines HK and IJ are parallel, their direction vectors must be scalar multiples. Therefore,

(12 + t(a -13), tb) = k*(a, b) for some scalar k.

Therefore, equating components:

12 + t(a -13) = k*a ...(1)

tb = k*b ...(2)

Assuming b ≠ 0 (otherwise, if b=0, then line IJ would be horizontal, but then line HK would also be horizontal, but need to check consistency).

From equation (2): tb = k*b → Assuming b ≠ 0, divide both sides by b: t = k. So k = t.

Substituting into equation (1):

12 + t(a -13) = t*a ⇒ 12 + ta -13t = ta ⇒ 12 -13t = 0 ⇒ 13t = 12 ⇒ t = 12/13.

So t is 12/13. Thus, the value of t is fixed regardless of a and b? Interesting.

Therefore, point K divides line GJ in the ratio t:(1-t), i.e., 12/13 : 1/13, meaning that GK / KG_total = 12/13 ?

Wait, actually, since t is the fraction from G to J. So when t = 0, you are at G; when t = 1, you are at J. Therefore, the length from G to K is t times the length of GJ. Since GJ is given as 8, then GK = t * 8 = (12/13)*8 = 96/13 ≈ 7.38...

But we need to find KJ, which is the remaining portion of GJ after GK. Since total length GJ is 8, then KJ = GJ - GK = 8 - 96/13 = (104 - 96)/13 = 8/13. Wait, that would be 8/13? But that's approximately 0.615... However, none of the answer choices are fractions. The options are integers: 2,4,6,8. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake.

Wait, hold on. Wait, if t is 12/13, then K is closer to G than to J. Therefore, KJ would be the length from K to J, which is (1 - t) * GJ. Since t = 12/13, then 1 - t = 1/13. Hence, KJ = (1/13)*8 = 8/13. Which is roughly 0.615. But that's not among the answer choices. So, either my approach is wrong, or I misapplied something.

Alternatively, maybe I messed up the direction of the vector. Let me re-examine the equations.

Earlier, I said that vector HK is (x_K -1, y_K), and vector IJ is (a, b). And they are scalar multiples. So, there exists a scalar k such that:

(x_K -1, y_K) = k*(a, b)

But earlier, I considered that t was equal to k. Wait, let's go back.

From equation (2): tb = k*b → t = k, assuming b ≠ 0. Then equation (1) becomes:

12 + t(a -13) = k*a = t*a → 12 + t(a -13) = t*a → 12 + ta -13t = ta → 12 -13t = 0 → t = 12/13. So that's correct.

Thus, the value of t is 12/13. Therefore, the coordinates of K are determined by t = 12/13 along GJ. Hence, the length from G to K is t*GJ = (12/13)*8 = 96/13, and hence KJ = GJ - GK = 8 - 96/13 = (104 -96)/13 = 8/13. But this gives KJ = 8/13, which isn't an option. So, something is wrong here.

Wait, but maybe my assumption about the direction of the vector is incorrect. Let me check.

Another possibility: Maybe the vector HK is parallel to IJ, but not necessarily in the same direction. So, the scalar multiple could be negative. Let me check.

Suppose instead that (x_K -1, y_K) = k*(a, b), where k could be positive or negative. Earlier, I assumed that from equation (2), tb = k*b implies t = k if b≠0. But if b=0, then equation (2) would give tb = 0 = k*b, which would imply either b=0 or k=0. But if b=0, then line IJ would be horizontal (since IJ is from (0,0) to (a,0)), so direction vector (a,0). Then line HK would also have to be horizontal. But then K would lie on GJ, which is a line from G(13,0) to J(a,0). If J is on the same horizontal line, then GJ is horizontal. So, K would also be on that line. Then, HK would be horizontal, so K would have the same y-coordinate as H, which is 0. So, in this case, if b=0, then J is on the x-axis. Let me explore this scenario.

If b=0, then J is on the x-axis. Let me say J is at (c,0). Then line GJ is from G(13,0) to J(c,0). So, it's along the x-axis. Then, K is on GJ, so it's also on x-axis. Then, line HK is from H(1,0) to K, which is also on x-axis. So, HK is horizontal, same as IJ (which is from I(0,0) to J(c,0), also horizontal). So, they are parallel. So, this works.

In this case, let me calculate KJ. Since GJ is from G(13,0) to J(c,0), length GJ is |c -13| = 8. So, c -13 = ±8. So, c = 13 +8 = 21 or c =13 -8 =5.

Now, line IJ is from I(0,0) to J(c,0). So, direction vector is (c,0). Line HK is from H(1,0) to K on GJ. Since GJ is from 13 to c on x-axis. So, K is somewhere between G and J or outside.

But earlier, we had that t = 12/13. Wait, but in this case, since b=0, we can recalculate t.

Let me redo the calculation with b=0. So, J is (c,0). Then, the direction vector of IJ is (c, 0). Vector HK is (x_K -1, 0). These vectors are scalar multiples. So:

(x_K -1, 0) = k*(c, 0) ⇒ x_K -1 = kc and 0 = 0k. So, x_K = 1 + kc.

But also, K lies on line GJ. Since GJ is from G(13,0) to J(c,0), parametric form: x =13 + t(c -13), y=0. So, x_K = 13 + t(c -13). Therefore, 1 + kc =13 + t(c -13).

But also, since t is the parameter such that when t=0, it's at G(13,0), and t=1, it's at J(c,0). So, the value of t is related to the position of K.

But earlier, we derived that t = 12/13. Wait, but in this case, since we have the same setup, even though b=0, the previous derivation still holds? Let me check.

Wait, previously, we had for general b≠0, t = 12/13. In this specific case with b=0, does that still hold?

Yes, because in the previous equations, we arrived at t = 12/13 independent of the value of a and b. So, in this case, with b=0, we still have t = 12/13.

Therefore, x_K = 13 + t(c -13) = 13 + (12/13)(c -13).

But also, x_K = 1 + kc. From above, x_K =1 + kc. But since vector HK is (x_K -1, 0) = k*(c, 0), so k = (x_K -1)/c.

But we also have x_K =1 + kc = 1 + [(x_K -1)/c]*c = x_K. Which is consistent, but doesn't help us directly.

However, we also have that the length of GJ is 8. As mentioned, |c -13|=8 ⇒ c=21 or 5.

Case 1: c = 21. So, J is at (21,0). Then, line GJ is from (13,0) to (21,0). Length is 8.

Now, K is located at t = 12/13 along GJ. So, the x-coordinate of K is 13 + (12/13)*(21 -13) = 13 + (12/13)*8 = 13 + 96/13 = (169 + 96)/13 = 265/13 ≈ 20.3846. Then, the distance from K to J is 21 - 265/13 = (273 -265)/13 = 8/13 ≈ 0.615. Again, same result.

Case 2: c = 5. So, J is at (5,0). Then, line GJ is from (13,0) to (5,0), so length is 13 -5 =8, which matches. Now, K is located at t =12/13 along GJ. But since GJ is from G(13,0) to J(5,0), moving from G to J decreases the x-coordinate. So, t=12/13 would take us beyond J? Let me calculate x_K:

x_K =13 + (12/13)*(5 -13) = 13 + (12/13)*(-8) = 13 - 96/13 = (169 -96)/13 = 73/13 ≈ 5.615. Then, the distance from K to J is |x_J - x_K| = |5 - 73/13| = |(65 -73)/13| = |-8/13| = 8/13. Same result.

Either way, KJ = 8/13. Still not matching the answer choices. So, this suggests that my approach is missing something.

Wait, but maybe the problem is not about segments but about vectors? Or maybe I misunderstood the problem statement.

Rechecking the problem statement:

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS:
Equals(LengthOf(Line(I, H)), 1)
PointLiesOnLine(H, Line(I, G))
PointLiesOnLine(K, Line(G, J))
Parallel(Line(H, K), Line(I, J))

QUESTION:
Find K J if G J = 8, G H = 12, and H I = 4."

Wait, here's a possible error. The user wrote "H I = 4". Previously, I took the length of IH as 1, but the problem says "H I = 4"? Wait, original problem says:

"Equals(LengthOf(Line(I, H)), 1)" — so that's IH = 1. But then later, the question says "if G J = 8, G H = 12, and H I = 4." Wait, there's inconsistency here. Wait, the initial constraints include that IH = 1, but the question includes H I = 4? Or is there a typo?

Wait, looking back:

Original problem says:

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS:
Equals(LengthOf(Line(I, H)), 1)
PointLiesOnLine(H, Line(I, G))
PointLiesOnLine(K, Line(G, J))
Parallel(Line(H, K), Line(I, J))

QUESTION:
Find K J if G J = 8, G H = 12, and H I = 4."

Ah! There's a contradiction here. The given constraints say that the length of IH is 1, but the question adds H I = 4. This must be a mistake. Perhaps the user intended different values? Or maybe I misread.

Wait, let me read carefully again:

The problem states:

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS:
Equals(LengthOf(Line(I, H)), 1)
...
QUESTION:
Find K J if G J = 8, G H = 12, and H I = 4."

So, the given constraints include that IH = 1, but the question provides H I = 4. This is contradictory. Unless it's a translation error or a typo. 

Wait, maybe the problem meant that GH = 12, HI = 4? Or maybe the initial constraints were different. Let me double-check.

Original problem:

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS:
Equals(LengthOf(Line(I, H)), 1)
PointLiesOnLine(H, Line(I, G))
PointLiesOnLine(K, Line(G, J))
Parallel(Line(H, K), Line(I, J))

QUESTION:
Find K J if G J = 8, G H = 12, and H I = 4."

So, in the problem statement, the given constraints specify that IH = 1, but the question asks for KJ given that GH = 12, HI = 4. This is conflicting. It appears there's an inconsistency between the given constraints and the question parameters. This might be a critical error. Perhaps the initial constraint should have been GI = 1, or maybe there's a misprint. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in Chinese or another language, and the translation led to confusion. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for KI instead of KJ? Or maybe there's a misunderstanding in the labels.

Alternatively, maybe the length of IH is 4, and the initial constraint was a mistake. Let me try assuming that the given constraints have a typo, and that the actual lengths are as per the question: GJ =8, GH=12, HI=4. Let me try solving under that assumption.

Let me reset the problem. Assume that:

- GH = 12
- HI = 4
- GJ = 8
- Lines HK and IJ are parallel
- H lies on line IG
- K lies on line GJ

Need to find KJ.

Let me reassign coordinates accordingly.

Let me place point H somewhere. Let me assume points I, H, G are colinear. Let me set I at (0,0), H at (4,0) since HI = 4. Then, since H lies on line IG, G is along the line extending from I through H. Given that GH = 12, then G is located at H + direction from I to H scaled appropriately.

Since from I(0,0) to H(4,0), the vector is (4,0). To get from H to G, which is length 12 in the same line. So, G would be at H + (vector IH normalized * length GH). Since IH is along x-axis from I(0,0) to H(4,0), direction is (1,0). So, G is at H plus 12 units in the same direction. So, from H(4,0), adding 12 units in x-direction: G is at (4 + 12, 0) = (16, 0). So, coordinates:

I(0,0), H(4,0), G(16,0).

Now, need to find KJ, given that GJ = 8, and lines HK and IJ are parallel, with K lying on line GJ.

Let me denote point J somewhere. Line GJ has length 8. Let me parametrize J.

Let me assume J is at some point such that the distance from G(16,0) to J is 8. Let me choose coordinates for J. Let me assume J is at (16 + 8*cosθ, 0 + 8*sinθ), but this might complicate things. Alternatively, let me consider coordinates where line GJ is arbitrary, but we'll use the parallelism condition.

Again, using the parallelism between HK and IJ.

Let me use vectors again. Let me denote coordinates for J as (a, b). Then, line IJ goes from I(0,0) to J(a,b), so direction vector is (a, b). Line HK goes from H(4,0) to K, which lies on line GJ. Let me parametrize K.

First, find parametric equations for line GJ. G is at (16,0), J is at (a,b). Parametric equations: any point on GJ can be written as G + t(J - G) = (16 + t(a -16), 0 + t(b - 0)) = (16 + t(a -16), tb).

So, coordinates of K: x = 16 + t(a -16), y = tb.

Vector HK is (x - 4, y - 0) = (16 + t(a -16) -4, tb) = (12 + t(a -16), tb).

This vector must be parallel to vector IJ, which is (a, b). So, there exists scalar k such that:

(12 + t(a -16), tb) = k*(a, b).

Which gives the equations:

12 + t(a -16) = ka ...(1)

tb = kb ...(2)

Assuming b ≠ 0, from equation (2): t = k. Substituting into equation (1):

12 + t(a -16) = t*a => 12 + ta -16t = ta => 12 -16t = 0 => t = 12/16 = 3/4.

So, t = 3/4. Therefore, point K is located at t = 3/4 along GJ.

Since GJ has length 8, then KJ is the remaining portion after moving from G to K. The length from G to K is t * GJ = (3/4)*8 = 6. Hence, KJ = GJ - GK = 8 - 6 = 2. 

That gives KJ = 2, which corresponds to option A. 

Wait, this makes sense! Earlier, the confusion came from conflicting lengths in the problem statement. Initially, there was a conflict between the given constraint IH = 1 and the question's H I = 4. By resolving that discrepancy (assuming the question's parameters override the initial constraint), we arrive at a solution where KJ = 2, which matches option A.

So, the correct answer is A. 2.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration described by the constraints and the given numerical data:

### Step 1: Understand the Geometric Configuration

We are told:

- $ \text{Length}(IH) = 1 $
- $ \text{Length}(GH) = 12 $
- $ \text{Length}(GJ) = 8 $
- $ \text{Point } H \text{ lies on line } IG $
- $ \text{Point } K \text{ lies on line } GJ $
- $ \text{Lines } HK \parallel IJ $

We are asked to **find** the length of $ KJ $, given these conditions.

---

### Step 2: Assign Coordinates Based on Known Lengths

To simplify calculations, we will place the points on a coordinate plane:

- Place $ I $ at the origin: $ I = (0, 0) $
- Since $ IH = 1 $, place $ H $ at $ (1, 0) $
- Since $ GH = 12 $, and $ H $ lies on the same line as $ I $ and $ G $, we move 12 units from $ H $ in the same direction as $ IH $.  
  So, $ G = (1 + 12, 0) = (13, 0) $

At this point, we have:
- $ I = (0, 0) $
- $ H = (1, 0) $
- $ G = (13, 0) $

---

### Step 3: Determine the Position of Point $ J $

We are told that:
- $ GJ = 8 $
- $ K $ lies on line $ GJ $
- Line $ HK \parallel IJ $

Let’s represent $ J $ as $ (a, b) $, so that vector $ \vec{IJ} = (a, b) $

Any point $ K $ on line $ GJ $ can be expressed as:
$$
\vec{K} = G + t(\vec{GJ}) = (13, 0) + t((a - 13), b) = (13 + t(a - 13), tb)
$$

Then, vector $ \vec{HK} = (x_K - 1, y_K) = (13 + t(a - 13) - 1, tb) = (12 + t(a - 13), tb) $

For lines $ HK \parallel IJ $, the direction vectors must be scalar multiples:
$$
\vec{HK} = k \cdot \vec{IJ}
\Rightarrow (12 + t(a - 13), tb) = k(a, b)
$$

Matching components:
- $ 12 + t(a - 13) = ka $ ... (1)
- $ tb = kb $ ... (2)

Assuming $ b \neq 0 $, divide both sides of (2) by $ b $:
$$
t = k
$$

Substitute into (1):
$$
12 + t(a - 13) = ta \Rightarrow 12 = ta - t(a - 13) = 13t \Rightarrow t = \frac{12}{13}
$$

---

### Step 4: Compute $ KJ $

Since $ t = \frac{12}{13} $ represents the fraction of the path from $ G $ to $ J $, the segment $ GK = t \cdot GJ = \frac{12}{13} \cdot 8 = \frac{96}{13} $

Then,
$$
KJ = GJ - GK = 8 - \frac{96}{13} = \frac{104 - 96}{13} = \frac{8}{13}
$$

However, this contradicts the provided answer choices. This suggests that our initial interpretation of the given constraints may have been inconsistent. Re-evaluating the problem reveals that the question may have intended:

> “Given $ GJ = 8 $, $ GH = 12 $, and $ HI = 4 $”

Instead of the original constraint $ IH = 1 $. This resolves the inconsistency and allows us to reassess.

---

### Step 5: Recompute with Updated Assumptions

Using the corrected values:
- $ HI = 4 $, so place $ H = (4, 0) $
- $ I = (0, 0) $
- $ G = (16, 0) $, since $ GH = 12 $ in the same direction

Now, repeat steps with updated positions.

Let $ J = (a, b) $, so $ \vec{IJ} = (a, b) $

Any point $ K $ on line $ GJ $ is:
$$
\vec{K} = (16 + t(a - 16), tb)
$$

Then, $ \vec{HK} = (16 + t(a - 16) - 4, tb) = (12 + t(a - 16), tb) $

Setting this equal to $ k \cdot (a, b) $, we derive:
$$
12 + t(a - 16) = ka,\quad tb = kb
\Rightarrow t = k
\Rightarrow 12 + t(a - 16) = ta \Rightarrow t = \frac{12}{4} = 3
$$

Wait, this leads to a contradiction unless we revisit the algebra.

Actually, solving again:
$$
12 + t(a - 16) = ta \Rightarrow 12 = 16t \Rightarrow t = \frac{12}{16} = \frac{3}{4}
$$

So, $ t = \frac{3}{4} $

Then,
$$
KJ = (1 - t) \cdot GJ = \left(1 - \frac{3}{4}\right) \cdot 8 = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 8 = 2
$$

---

### Final Result

$$
\boxed{\text{KJ} = 2}
$$

**Answer:** Final Answer: A

$$
\boxed{A}
$$
