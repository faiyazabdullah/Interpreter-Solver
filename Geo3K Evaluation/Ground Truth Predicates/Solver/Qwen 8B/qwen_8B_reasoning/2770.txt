MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. So, we need to find the measure of angle A, given some angle relationships. Let me first try to visualize the figure based on the given information. 

The problem mentions points A, B, C, D with certain angles. The key constraints are:

- Measure of angle at point C (Angle CBA) is 2x.
- Measure of angle at point C (Angle DCB) is also 2x.
- Measure of angle at point D (Angle ADC) is x.
- Measure of angle at point A (Angle BAD) is x.

Wait, maybe I should draw a rough sketch to get a better idea. Let me think about how these points could be arranged. Since there are angles involving points A, B, C, D, it might be a quadrilateral or maybe two triangles connected somehow. But without knowing the exact configuration, I need to rely on the angle measures given.

Let me note down all the given angles:

1. ∠ABC = 2x (since Angle(C,B,A) means vertex at B between points C and A).
Wait, no—actually, the notation Angle(C,B,A) would mean the angle at point B formed by points C, B, A. So that's angle ABC. Similarly, Angle(D,C,B) is angle at C between D, C, B, so that's angle DCB. Then Angle(A,D,C) is angle at D between A, D, C, which is angle ADC. And Angle(B,A,D) is angle at A between B, A, D, so angle BAD.

So, summarizing:

- ∠ABC = 2x
- ∠DCB = 2x
- ∠ADC = x
- ∠BAD = x

We need to find m∠A, which is likely referring to angle at A. Wait, but angle BAD is already given as x. Is that the same as angle A? Or is there another angle at A?

Hmm, perhaps the diagram involves triangle ABD or something else. Maybe points A, B, C, D form a quadrilateral or intersecting lines. Let me consider possible configurations.

Alternatively, maybe points A, B, C, D lie on a straight line or form a star shape. Wait, but with angles given at different vertices.

Another approach: since angles at B and C are given, and angles at D and A are given, perhaps considering triangles or using triangle angle sum theorem.

Let me consider triangle ABC first. If we have angle at B (∠ABC) as 2x. However, unless we know more sides or angles, maybe that's not directly helpful. Alternatively, looking for cyclic quadrilaterals? Because sometimes opposite angles relate.

But wait, if there's a cyclic quadrilateral, then opposite angles sum to 180 degrees. However, we don't know if the quadrilateral is cyclic yet. Let me check if that applies here.

Alternatively, maybe there are multiple triangles involved. For example, if points A, B, C, D form two triangles sharing a common side or something.

Wait, let's look again. We have angles at B, C, D, and A. Let me see if I can find relations between them.

Starting with point B: angle ABC is 2x. At point C, angle DCB is 2x. So those are adjacent angles? If points A-B-C-D are connected in some way... Maybe B and C are connected, and D is another point connected to C?

Also, angle at D, ADC is x, and angle at A, BAD is x. So maybe triangle ADC has angle at D equal to x, and triangle BAD has angle at A equal to x. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps points A, B, C, D are arranged such that AB and CD are two lines intersecting at some point, or forming a transversal. Alternatively, maybe they form a pentagon? Not sure.

Alternatively, think of triangle ABD and triangle CBD? Let me try to imagine.

Suppose we have triangle ABD with angle at A being x (∠BAD = x). Also, there's another angle at D, ∠ADC = x. So maybe point C is somewhere connected to D and B?

Wait, angle DCB is 2x. So at point C, between D and B, angle is 2x. So if we have points D, C, B with angle at C being 2x.

This seems like a complex setup. Maybe drawing auxiliary lines or considering triangle properties.

Alternatively, maybe considering vertical angles or supplementary angles. Let me try to assign variables and set up equations.

Let me denote:

At point B, angle ABC = 2x.

At point C, angle DCB = 2x.

At point D, angle ADC = x.

At point A, angle BAD = x.

Now, trying to find m∠A. Assuming that ∠A refers to angle at point A, which could be part of a triangle. For example, if we consider triangle ABD, then angle at A is x, angle at D is something, and angle at B is something else. But without more info, hard to tell.

Wait, maybe there's a triangle involving point A, D, and another point. Let me think.

If we look at triangle ADC: angle at D is x, angle at C is... Well, angle at C is part of angle DCB which is 2x. But unless we know more about triangle ADC, maybe not directly helpful.

Alternatively, think about the entire figure. Suppose points A, B, C, D are arranged such that AB and CD are two lines intersected by BC and AD. Maybe creating a trapezoid or some other quadrilateral.

Alternatively, maybe considering that angles at B and C are both 2x, and angles at D and A are x. Perhaps the total sum around certain points can help.

For instance, considering point B: the angles around point B. If there's a line BA and BC, then the angle between them is 2x. Similarly, at point C, the angle between CB and CD is 2x.

But without knowing if lines are straight or forming polygons, it's tricky.

Wait, another thought: maybe the figure is made up of two triangles, ABC and ADC, connected at point C? Let me try that.

Assume that ABC is a triangle with angle at B = 2x, and ADC is another triangle with angle at D = x. But how do they connect?

Alternatively, think of a quadrilateral ABCD. In that case, the sum of internal angles would be (4-2)*180=360 degrees. However, the given angles are only parts of that.

But if ABCD is a quadrilateral, then:

Sum of angles = ∠A + ∠B + ∠C + ∠D = 360°

But the given angles are:

∠ABC = 2x (which is ∠B),

∠DCB = 2x (which is ∠C),

∠ADC = x (which is ∠D),

and ∠BAD = x (which is ∠A).

Wait, if that's the case, then substituting into the quadrilateral angle sum:

∠A + ∠B + ∠C + ∠D = x + 2x + 2x + x = 6x = 360° ⇒ 6x = 360° ⇒ x = 60°. Therefore, ∠A is x = 60°, which would make answer B.

But wait, hold on—is that valid? Are all four angles accounted for in the quadrilateral? Let me confirm.

In a quadrilateral ABCD, the angles are at each vertex: ∠A, ∠B, ∠C, ∠D. So if ∠BAD is x, that is ∠A. ∠ABC is ∠B. ∠BCD is ∠C (but the given is ∠DCB, which is the same as ∠BCD). And ∠ADC is ∠D. So yes, if ABCD is a convex quadrilateral, then adding up those angles gives 6x = 360°, leading to x=60°, hence ∠A is x=60°, so answer B.

But wait, does this assumption that ABCD is a quadrilateral hold? The problem didn't specify that, but given the angles mentioned, it's plausible. However, there's a possibility that the figure isn't a simple quadrilateral. For example, maybe some of the points are colinear or the figure is self-intersecting. But given that angles are defined, probably assuming a convex quadrilateral.

Alternatively, maybe there's another configuration. Let me check if this holds with other constraints.

Suppose ABCD is a quadrilateral with angles:

∠A = x,

∠B = 2x,

∠C = 2x,

∠D = x.

Then sum is 6x = 360° → x = 60°, so ∠A = 60°, which is option B.

However, is there a reason why this configuration is valid? For example, can such a quadrilateral exist?

Yes, if the angles add up correctly. For example, if you have a trapezoid or kite-like shape. But even if it's not a standard quadrilateral, as long as the angles satisfy the sum, it's possible.

But wait, another thing: the problem mentions angles like ∠ADC and ∠BAD. In a quadrilateral ABCD, ∠ADC is indeed one of the angles. And ∠BAD is also one of the angles. So this seems consistent.

Therefore, solving 6x = 360°, x = 60°, so ∠A is x = 60°, answer B.

But wait, let me check again. Because maybe the angles given aren't all the internal angles of the quadrilateral. For example, maybe ∠ABC is not the entire internal angle at B. Wait, in a quadrilateral, each internal angle is at each vertex. So ∠ABC is the internal angle at B. Similarly, ∠DCB is the internal angle at C. ∠ADC is the internal angle at D. And ∠BAD is the internal angle at A. Hence, their sum is indeed 360°, so x=60°, making ∠A = x = 60°, answer B.

Alternatively, maybe there's another consideration. Let me think again. Suppose the diagram isn't a quadrilateral. For example, suppose points A, B, C, D are arranged such that lines AB, BC, CD, DA form a closed shape but not necessarily a quadrilateral. But without more info, it's safer to assume the simplest case, which is a quadrilateral.

Alternatively, maybe the figure includes triangles. Let me consider triangle ABC and triangle ADC. For example, if AC is a diagonal connecting A to C. Then, in triangle ABC, angle at B is 2x. In triangle ADC, angle at D is x. But how does that relate to angle at A?

Alternatively, if we consider triangle ABD. Given that angle at A is x (∠BAD), and maybe other angles?

Wait, perhaps there are overlapping triangles. Another approach: use the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, and maybe apply that to various triangles.

Let me try that. Suppose we have triangle ABC. In this triangle, we know angle at B is 2x. What about other angles? If we can express other angles in terms of x, maybe we can find relations.

But we need more information about sides or other angles. Unless there are other triangles connected.

Similarly, looking at triangle ADC: angle at D is x. Again, without more info, not helpful.

Wait, but maybe considering that points A, B, C, D lie on a circle (cyclic quadrilateral)? If that were true, then opposite angles would sum to 180°. However, in our earlier calculation, angles at A and C would be x and 2x, respectively. Their sum would be 3x. If they are supplementary, then 3x = 180° ⇒ x = 60°, which again leads to ∠A = 60°, same result. But this requires the quadrilateral to be cyclic. However, without knowing if it's cyclic, this assumption may not hold. But the previous method assumes a general quadrilateral, giving the same result. So regardless of whether it's cyclic or not, the sum of internal angles gives us x = 60°, leading to answer B. 

But wait, maybe there's a contradiction here. For example, if the quadrilateral is cyclic, then the sum of angles would still be 360°, but with specific relations between angles. However, in this case, the sum of angles gives us x=60°, regardless of being cyclic or not. So even if it's not cyclic, the sum remains 360°, so x=60°. Thus, answer B.

But to ensure correctness, let me check if there are alternative interpretations of the angle labels.

For example, Angle(C,B,A) is angle at B between C and A, which is ∠ABC. Similarly, Angle(D,C,B) is angle at C between D and B, which is ∠BCD. So ∠BCD = 2x. Then, Angle(A,D,C) is angle at D between A and C, which is ∠ADC = x. Angle(B,A,D) is angle at A between B and D, which is ∠BAD = x. 

Thus, in quadrilateral ABCD, the angles are:

At A: ∠BAD = x,

At B: ∠ABC = 2x,

At C: ∠BCD = 2x,

At D: ∠ADC = x.

Summing these gives x + 2x + 2x + x = 6x = 360° ⇒ x = 60°, so ∠A = x = 60°, answer B.

Therefore, the correct answer should be B. 60 degrees.

I think this makes sense. Let me just verify once more. Suppose x=60°, then angles are:

∠A = 60°, ∠B = 120°, ∠C = 120°, ∠D = 60°, summing to 6*60=360°, which checks out. So yes, that works. Therefore, the measure of angle A is 60°, answer B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $ \angle A $, we begin by interpreting the given angular constraints:

---

### Step 1: Understand the Geometry

From the problem description, we are told:

- $ \angle ABC = 2x $
- $ \angle DCB = 2x $
- $ \angle ADC = x $
- $ \angle BAD = x $

These describe angles at different vertices of a potential **quadrilateral** $ABCD$, with:

- Vertex $A$: angle $ \angle BAD = x $
- Vertex $B$: angle $ \angle ABC = 2x $
- Vertex $C$: angle $ \angle DCB = 2x $
- Vertex $D$: angle $ \angle ADC = x $

---

### Step 2: Use the Sum of Angles in a Quadrilateral

In any **convex quadrilateral**, the sum of the interior angles is always:

$$
\text{Sum} = 360^\circ
$$

Substituting the expressions for the angles:

$$
\angle A + \angle B + \angle C + \angle D = x + 2x + 2x + x = 6x
$$

Set this equal to 360°:

$$
6x = 360^\circ \Rightarrow x = 60^\circ
$$

---

### Step 3: Determine $ \angle A $

Since $ \angle A = x $, we substitute:

$$
\angle A = x = 60^\circ
$$

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{\text{B}}
$$
