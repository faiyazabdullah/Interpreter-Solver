MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to make sure I understand all the given information and what's being asked. 

So, the problem says that AD and CG are diameters of circle B. We need to find the measure of arc AG. The answer choices are A. 35, B. 40, C. 45, D. 55. 

Let me start by recalling some basic concepts about circles and angles. Since AD and CG are diameters of the circle centered at point B, points A, D, C, and G must all lie on the circumference of the circle with center B. Also, since they're diameters, the lines AD and CG pass through the center B. That means AB = BD and CB = BG because the diameter is twice the radius. Wait, but actually, since B is the center, each diameter would have endpoints on the circle such that B is the midpoint. So for example, AD is a diameter, so B is the midpoint between A and D. Similarly, CG is another diameter, so B is the midpoint between C and G. 

Now, looking at the angle measures given: angle CBD (which is Angle(C, B, D)) is 55 degrees, and angle GBF (Angle(G, B, F)) is 35 degrees. Hmm, I need to visualize this. Let me sketch a rough diagram mentally. There's a circle with center B. Points A, D, C, G are on the circle. AD and CG are diameters. So points A and D are opposite each other across B, same with C and G. Then there's point F mentioned here, which lies on the circle as well? Because PointLiesOnCircle(F, Circle(B, radius_6_0)). Wait, but the problem didn't mention F before except in the angle GBF. So maybe F is another point on the circle?

Wait, the constraints include that F is on the circle centered at B with radius 6.0. So all points A, C, D, G, F are on the circle with center B. But how does that relate to the angles given? 

The first angle is MeasureOf(Angle(C, B, D)) equals 55 degrees. So angle at point B between points C and D. Wait, angle CBD is formed by points C-B-D. So that's an angle at the center of the circle, between points C and D. Similarly, angle GBF is 35 degrees, which is the angle at point B between points G and F. 

Since AD and CG are diameters, then points A and D are endpoints of one diameter, and C and G are endpoints of another diameter. Therefore, the line segments AD and CG both pass through the center B. 

So, considering angle CBD: since AD is a diameter, and CG is another diameter, then points C and D are two different points on the circle. The angle at B between C and D would correspond to the central angle between those two points. Similarly for angle GBF. 

But wait, since CG is a diameter, point G is directly opposite point C. So if we consider the diameter CG, then moving from C to G through B. Similarly, AD is a diameter, so moving from A to D through B. 

Now, the question asks for the measure of arc AG. Arc AG would be the arc from A to G along the circumference of the circle. To find its measure, we can use the central angle corresponding to that arc. Since the measure of an arc is equal to the measure of its central angle. 

So, if we can find the central angle subtended by arc AG, that will give us the measure of the arc. 

To find that angle, perhaps we can find the positions of points A and G relative to each other around the circle. 

First, let's note down the known angles. 

We know that angle CBD is 55 degrees. Since B is the center, this is a central angle between points C and D. So the arc CD has measure 55 degrees. 

Similarly, angle GBF is 35 degrees. This is a central angle between points G and F. So arc GF has measure 35 degrees. However, we don't know where F is located yet. But since all these points are on the circle centered at B, maybe there's a relationship between them. 

Also, since AD and CG are diameters, points A and D are endpoints of one diameter, so they are 180 degrees apart. Similarly, points C and G are endpoints of another diameter, so they are also 180 degrees apart. 

Now, let's think about how the points are arranged. Let me try to imagine or draw a diagram step by step. 

Start with the circle centered at B. Let me place point A somewhere on the circle. Since AD is a diameter, point D is directly opposite A, so if I go from A through B to D. Similarly, point C is on the circle, and CG is a diameter, so G is directly opposite C. 

Now, angle CBD is 55 degrees. So starting from point C, going through B to D. That forms an angle of 55 degrees at the center. So the arc from C to D is 55 degrees. 

Then, angle GBF is 35 degrees. Starting from G, through B to F. So that's a central angle of 35 degrees, meaning arc GF is 35 degrees. 

But how do these arcs relate to the rest of the circle? 

Our goal is to find arc AG. Let me see. Maybe I need to find the total degrees around the circle and subtract known arcs. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to express arc AG in terms of other arcs. 

Let me consider the positions. Let me assume some coordinates or assign variables to help. 

Since AD and CG are diameters, let me consider their positions. Suppose I place point A at coordinate (1,0) on the unit circle for simplicity, but since the actual radius isn't specified, it might not matter. Alternatively, think in terms of angles. 

But maybe using angles between points. 

Starting with angle CBD = 55 degrees. That is, the angle between BC and BD at point B. Since BC is part of diameter CG (since C and G are endpoints), so BC is half of the diameter CG. Similarly, BD is part of diameter AD. 

Wait, BD is part of diameter AD. So BD is a radius? No, BD is half of the diameter. Wait, no. If AD is a diameter, then BD is half of AD. But since B is the center, BD is equal to BA, which is a radius. Wait, no. Wait, the entire diameter is AD, so length AD = 2r, where r is the radius. So the distance from B to D is r, since B is the center. 

Therefore, BC and BD are radii of the circle. So angle CBD is formed by two radii: BC and BD. Therefore, the measure of angle CBD is equal to the measure of the arc CD. Which is 55 degrees. So arc CD is 55 degrees. 

Similarly, angle GBF is 35 degrees. So that's the angle between GB and BF. Since GB is a radius (as G is an endpoint of diameter CG), and BF is another radius (since F is on the circle). Therefore, the arc GF is 35 degrees. 

Now, the key is to figure out the position of point A and point G relative to each other. 

Let me try to find relationships between arcs. 

First, since AD is a diameter, arc AD is 180 degrees. Similarly, arc CG is 180 degrees. 

Arc CD is 55 degrees, as established earlier. Since arc CD is part of the circle. Let me think about how arc CD relates to the rest of the circle. 

If I consider the entire circle as 360 degrees. Let me consider the positions:

- Points A and D are endpoints of diameter AD, so arc AD is 180 degrees.

- Points C and G are endpoints of diameter CG, so arc CG is 180 degrees.

Arc CD is 55 degrees. Let me try to find where point C is located relative to other points. 

Suppose we start from point A, move along the circle to D (arc AD is 180 degrees). Now, point C is somewhere else on the circle. The arc from C to D is 55 degrees. Depending on direction, but assuming standard position, perhaps. 

Alternatively, since arc CD is 55 degrees, then the arc from C to D is 55 degrees. Therefore, if we consider the circle, the remaining arc from D to C going the other way is 360 - 55 - ... Well, depending on the position. 

But perhaps it's better to consider the positions relative to each other. 

Let me try to imagine placing the points. Let me fix some reference. Let me suppose that point A is at the rightmost point of the circle, so coordinates (r, 0). Then point D, being the opposite end of the diameter, would be at (-r, 0). 

Now, point C is somewhere on the circle. The arc from C to D is 55 degrees. So if I'm at point D (-r, 0), moving 55 degrees towards point C along the circumference. Depending on direction, clockwise or counterclockwise. Assuming the standard counterclockwise direction, but without knowing the exact configuration, maybe it's ambiguous. However, since angles are typically measured in the positive direction unless stated otherwise. 

Alternatively, since angle CBD is 55 degrees, which is the angle between BC and BD. Since BD is pointing towards D, which is left along the x-axis from point B (the origin). So vector BD is pointing from B to D, which is to the left. Vector BC is pointing from B to C. The angle between BD and BC is 55 degrees. 

So if BD is pointing to the left (assuming D is at (-r, 0)), then BC makes a 55-degree angle with BD. So if BD is pointing left, then BC could be 55 degrees above or below BD. Let's say counterclockwise. So if BD is pointing to the left (along negative x-axis), then rotating 55 degrees counterclockwise from BD would point upwards. So point C would be 55 degrees above the negative x-axis, i.e., in the second quadrant. 

Similarly, angle GBF is 35 degrees. So angle between GB and BF is 35 degrees. Since GB is part of diameter CG, so GB is pointing from B to G. Since G is the opposite end of diameter from C, so if C is in the second quadrant, then G would be in the opposite direction from C, which would be the third quadrant. Wait, if C is in the second quadrant, then G would be diametrically opposite, so in the third quadrant. 

But let me check again. If point C is in the second quadrant, then the diameter CG passes through B, so G is directly opposite C. So if C is at some angle θ from the positive x-axis, then G would be at θ + 180 degrees. 

But perhaps I need to define coordinates more precisely. Let me attempt to assign coordinates based on angles. 

Assume the circle has center B at the origin (0,0). Let’s set up coordinates:

- Let’s take point A at (1, 0) for simplicity. Then point D is (-1, 0) since AD is a diameter.

- Let’s consider point C. The angle between BC and BD is 55 degrees. BD is the vector from B to D, which is (-1, 0). So the direction of BD is 180 degrees from the positive x-axis. The angle between BC and BD is 55 degrees. So if BD is at 180 degrees, then BC is at 180 - 55 = 125 degrees? Or 180 + 55 = 235 degrees? Depending on the orientation. 

Wait, angle between BC and BD is 55 degrees. So if BD is pointing to the left (180 degrees), then BC is either 55 degrees above or below BD. Assuming the angle is measured in the counterclockwise direction, then BC would be 55 degrees counterclockwise from BD. So from BD (pointing left), turning 55 degrees counterclockwise would point upward into the second quadrant. So the direction of BC is 180 - 55 = 125 degrees from the positive x-axis. Therefore, point C is located at an angle of 125 degrees. 

Thus, coordinates of C can be represented as (cos(125°), sin(125°)). 

Since CG is a diameter, point G is diametrically opposite to C. Therefore, the angle for G would be 125° + 180° = 305°, or equivalently, -55°. 

So point G is at 305 degrees. 

Now, angle GBF is 35 degrees. So this is the angle between GB and BF. Since GB is pointing from B to G, which is at 305 degrees. So the direction of GB is 305 degrees. The angle between GB and BF is 35 degrees. So BF is another radius, so point F is somewhere on the circle. 

Let me determine the direction of BF. The angle between GB (direction 305°) and BF is 35 degrees. Again, assuming the angle is measured in the counterclockwise direction. So from GB (305°), turning 35 degrees counterclockwise would lead to BF at 305° + 35° = 340°, or if it's the other direction, 305° - 35° = 270°. But which one is it? 

Hmm. The problem states that point F is on the circle. Without loss of generality, maybe we need to figure out based on other constraints. However, since we need to find arc AG, perhaps the position of F isn't directly necessary. Let me see. 

But maybe there's a relation between points A, G, and others. Our target is arc AG. 

Point A is at 0°, point G is at 305°. The arc from A to G depends on the shorter path around the circle. The central angle between A (0°) and G (305°) can be calculated as follows: 

The difference in angles is |305° - 0°| = 305°, but since angles wrap around every 360°, the smaller arc would be the minimum between 305° and 360° - 305° = 55°. Wait, that seems conflicting. 

Wait, 305° is equivalent to -55°, so the angle from A (0°) to G (-55°) going clockwise is 55°, while going counterclockwise is 305°. Therefore, the minor arc AG is 55°, but wait that's only if the angle between them is 55°. But according to our previous calculation, point G is at 305°, which is 360° - 55°, so yes, the arc from A to G through the shorter path is 55 degrees. 

Wait, but that would mean that the measure of arc AG is 55°, which is option D. But let me verify this carefully. 

Wait, but hold on. How did we get point G at 305°? Because point C was at 125°, so G is diametrically opposite, so adding 180° gives 125° + 180° = 305°, which is correct. 

Then, point A is at 0°, so the arc from A to G is the angle between them. But since G is at 305°, which is equivalent to -55°, the arc from A (0°) to G (305°) is indeed 55°, because you can go clockwise from A to G through the lower part of the circle, covering 55°, or counterclockwise through the upper part, which is 305°. Hence, the minor arc AG is 55°, which would correspond to answer D. 

But wait, the problem says "Find m∠AG", which is the measure of arc AG. But let me double-check whether my assumption about the position of G is correct. 

Earlier steps: 

- AD is a diameter, so A is at 0°, D at 180°. 

- Angle CBD is 55°, which led us to point C at 125°, hence point G at 305°. 

Is there any possibility that the angle between BC and BD is measured differently? For instance, maybe the angle is measured in the other direction. Let me consider that. 

If instead of measuring 55° counterclockwise from BD, it's measured clockwise. Then, from BD (pointing left at 180°), turning 55° clockwise would point downward, making the direction of BC at 180° - 55° = 125°? Wait, no. Turning clockwise from BD (which is pointing left) by 55° would head towards the fourth quadrant. Let me clarify. 

Imagine standing at point B (origin), facing point D (left). Turning clockwise 55° would face you downwards. So the direction of BC would be 180° - 55° = 125°? No, wait. If you turn clockwise from left (180°) by 55°, your new direction is 180° - 55° = 125°? No, that's not correct. 

Wait, directions are measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis. So if you are facing left (180°), then turning clockwise by 55° would face you towards 180° - 55° = 125°? No, that's not. Let me think numerically. 

If you face left (180°), then turning clockwise by 55° would decrease your angle by 55°, so 180° - 55° = 125°, which is still in the second quadrant. Wait, but that would be facing upwards. Wait, confusion arises. Let me think of specific angles. 

At 180°, you're facing left. If you turn clockwise by 90°, you'd face down (270°). So turning 55° clockwise from 180° would face you at 180° - 55° = 125°, which is 125° counterclockwise from the positive x-axis. That is, in the second quadrant. So that's correct. 

So regardless of direction, the angle between BC and BD is 55°, leading to point C at 125°, hence point G at 305°, which is 305° counterclockwise from positive x-axis. 

Therefore, arc AG spans from A (0°) to G (305°). As discussed, the minor arc is 55°, so the measure of arc AG is 55°, which would be answer D. 

However, wait! Let me cross-verify with the other given angle, angle GBF = 35°, to ensure consistency. 

Point G is at 305°, and angle GBF is 35°, meaning the angle between GB and BF is 35°. So GB is pointing from B to G, which is at 305°, and BF is pointing from B to F. So the direction of GB is 305°, and BF is 305° ± 35°, depending on the direction of the angle. 

Assuming the angle is measured counterclockwise from GB to BF, then BF would be at 305° + 35° = 340°, or if measured clockwise, it would be 305° - 35° = 270°. 

Either way, point F would be at 340° or 270°. 

But since all points are on the circle, and we don't have more constraints on F, this might not affect the calculation of arc AG. However, just to confirm that there are no contradictions. 

For example, if BF is at 270°, then point F is straight down. If BF is at 340°, then point F is near the positive x-axis. Either way, it doesn't conflict with the existing points. 

So, given that, arc AG is indeed 55°, which would be answer D. 

Wait, but let me check once more. Another approach: since AD and CG are diameters, then points A, D, C, G are all on the circle. The central angles between them. 

We know that arc CD is 55°, as per angle CBD. Also, since CG is a diameter, arc CG is 180°, so arc from C to G is 180°. 

From point C to G is 180°, and from C to D is 55°, so perhaps we can find the position of D relative to G? 

Wait, if we consider the circle, from point C to D is 55°, and from C to G is 180°, then the arc from D to G would be arc DG = arc CG - arc CD = 180° - 55° = 125°? Wait, no. It depends on the direction. 

If arc CD is 55°, then depending on the direction from C to D, and arc CG is 180°, then arc DG would be arc CD plus something? 

Actually, if we consider point D and point G, their positions depend on the arrangement. 

Alternatively, since we've already determined that arc AG is 55°, but let me think if there's another way this could be derived. 

Another thought: the sum of arcs around the circle. 

Total circle is 360°. 

If we can find arcs that add up to the rest, but I need to see connections. 

Alternatively, since AD is a diameter, arc AD is 180°, and CG is a diameter, arc CG is 180°. 

But how does arc AG fit in? 

If we can express arc AG as the sum or difference of other arcs. 

For example, from A to D is 180°, and from D to G...? 

But I need to find relations between these arcs. 

Earlier, we had arc CD = 55°, and arc CG = 180°, so arc from C to G is 180°, which includes arc from C to D (55°) and from D to G. So arc DG = arc CG - arc CD = 180° - 55° = 125°. 

So arc DG is 125°. 

Now, since AD is a diameter, arc AD is 180°, so from A to D is 180°. 

If we want arc AG, maybe we can combine arc AD and arc DG? 

Wait, from A to D is 180°, and from D to G is 125°, so arc AG would be arc AD + arc DG = 180° + 125° = 305°, but that's the major arc AG. However, the minor arc AG is the smaller one, which is 55°, as previously determined. 

Yes, because 305° is greater than 180°, so the minor arc is 55°. 

Hence, confirming that the measure of arc AG is 55°, which corresponds to answer D. 

But wait, the answer choices include D as 55. But let me check if there's a mistake here. 

Wait, but in the initial problem statement, angle GBF is 35°, which we haven't used yet. Did we account for that? 

In our analysis, we assumed that the position of point G is fixed based on arc CD = 55°, but perhaps the angle GBF = 35° affects the position of point F, which might influence something else? 

But since the question is about arc AG, which we derived based on points A and G, which were determined via the angle CBD = 55°, and the fact that CG is a diameter. The position of F is determined by angle GBF = 35°, but since F is arbitrary (other than being on the circle), it doesn't affect the arc AG. Therefore, even though there's another angle given, it doesn't interfere with the calculation of arc AG. 

Therefore, the measure of arc AG should be 55°, which is answer D. 

But let me check once more. Let me consider another approach. 

The measure of arc AG is equal to the central angle ∠ABG, since it's the angle at the center between points A and G. 

So if we can compute ∠ABG, that would be the measure of arc AG. 

Point A is on the circle, point G is also on the circle. Let me find the angle between vectors BA and BG. 

Vector BA goes from B to A, which is along the positive x-axis (if A is at (1,0)). 

Vector BG goes from B to G, which we determined earlier as 305°, which is equivalent to -55°, or 360° - 55° = 305°. So the angle between BA (0°) and BG (305°) is the difference between their angles. 

Since angles are periodic modulo 360°, the angle between them is the smallest positive angle between 0° and 305°, which is 55°, as before. 

Thus, the central angle ∠ABG is 55°, hence arc AG is 55°, so answer D. 

This confirms the previous conclusion. 

Therefore, despite the presence of the other angle (angle GBF = 35°), it doesn't affect the calculation of arc AG, which relies solely on the positions of A and G determined by AD and CG being diameters and the given angle CBD = 55°. 

Hence, the correct answer is D. 55 degrees.
