MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given information and figure out how the points relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the constraints provided:

1. The length of line segment PQ is 9 units.
2. The length of line segment QR is 7 units.
3. The length of line segment SR is also 7 units.
4. Point R lies on the line SQ. So, R is somewhere along the line connecting S and Q.
5. Point P lies on the line RA. So, P is somewhere along the line that connects R and A.
6. The lines RP and RQ are perpendicular. That means angle PRQ is a right angle.

The question asks for PS. So, we need to find the distance between points P and S.

Let me visualize this. Maybe drawing a diagram would help. Since there are several points involved (P, Q, R, S, A), but some relationships are given through lines and lengths. 

Starting with point R lying on SQ. So, S-Q-R are colinear, with R somewhere between S and Q? Or maybe extended beyond? Not sure yet. Also, since QR is 7 units, and SR is 7 units. Wait, QR is from Q to R, which is part of SQ. If R is on SQ, then QR is part of SQ. But SR is another segment of length 7. Let me think.

If R is on SQ, then SQ can be split into segments SR and RQ? Wait, depending on where R is located. Suppose S----R----Q, so that SR + RQ = SQ. Then SR is 7, QR is 7, so SQ would be 14. Alternatively, if R is between S and Q such that SR is 7 and RQ is 7, making SQ equal to 14. But maybe R could be outside? For example, if R is beyond Q, then SR would be SQ + QR? But then SR would be longer than QR. However, in our case, both QR and SR are 7. So perhaps R is between S and Q, making SQ = SR + RQ = 7 + 7 = 14. That seems plausible.

So SQ is 14 units long. Now, considering that point P lies on line RA. Also, the lines RP and RQ are perpendicular. So, at point R, the lines RP and RQ form a right angle. Therefore, triangle PRQ is a right-angled triangle at R. Because angle PRQ is 90 degrees.

Given that QR is 7 units, and PR is... Well, we don't know PR directly. But maybe we can use Pythagoras here. Wait, but we need more info about the triangle. Also, we have PQ as 9 units. Since PQ is given as 9, and in triangle PRQ, PQ is the hypotenuse because it's opposite the right angle at R. So, according to Pythagoras:

PQ² = PR² + QR²

We know PQ is 9, QR is 7. So,

9² = PR² + 7²  
81 = PR² + 49  
PR² = 81 - 49 = 32  
Therefore, PR = √32 = 4√2 ≈ 5.656...

But how does this help us find PS?

Wait, we need to find PS. Let me recall the positions of the points. We have points S, Q, R colinear with R between them (assuming SQ=14). Also, point P lies on line RA. Hmm, but where is point A? The problem mentions line RA, but there's no direct information about A except that P lies on RA. So, perhaps A is arbitrary? Or maybe there's something else?

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express PS using coordinates. Let me try coordinate geometry.

Let me assign coordinates to make this easier. Let's place point R at the origin (0, 0) for simplicity. Since lines RP and RQ are perpendicular, we can align them with axes. Let me assume that line RQ is along the x-axis and line RP is along the y-axis. So, point R is (0, 0).

Since QR is 7 units, and RQ is along the x-axis, then point Q is at (7, 0) because moving from R (origin) towards positive x-direction. Wait, but earlier we thought that SQ is 14. Wait, but if R is between S and Q, then S would be on the opposite side of R relative to Q. Let me clarify:

If R is on SQ, then SQ is divided into SR and RQ. Since SR = 7 and RQ = 7, then SQ = SR + RQ = 14. So, if R is between S and Q, then S is located at (-7, 0) if Q is at (7, 0), with R at (0, 0). Wait, but that would make SR = 7 units (distance from S(-7,0) to R(0,0)) and RQ = 7 units (from R(0,0) to Q(7,0)). So yes, that works.

So, coordinates:

R = (0, 0)

Q = (7, 0)

S = (-7, 0)

Now, point P lies on line RA. But where is point A? Wait, the problem didn't specify anything about A except that P lies on line RA. So perhaps A is arbitrary? But without more info, maybe we can find relations based on other constraints.

Also, we have that line RP is perpendicular to line RQ. Since RQ is along the x-axis, then RP should be vertical (along y-axis). Wait, because RQ is horizontal (x-axis direction), then RP must be vertical (y-axis) to be perpendicular. So, point P lies somewhere along the y-axis. Wait, but line RA passes through P. So, if P is on the y-axis, then line RA must pass through P. But we need to define point A. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe we can determine coordinates of P? Since PR is known? Earlier calculation gave PR = sqrt(32). Since R is at (0,0), and RP is along the y-axis, then P is at (0, sqrt(32)) or (0, -sqrt(32)). Let me check.

From earlier, in triangle PRQ, with R at (0,0), Q at (7,0), and P somewhere. Since PR is vertical, P has coordinates (0, b). Then, PQ is the distance from P(0,b) to Q(7,0):

Distance PQ squared is (7 - 0)^2 + (0 - b)^2 = 49 + b². And we know PQ is 9, so:

49 + b² = 81 => b² = 32 => b = ±√32. So P is at (0, √32) or (0, -√32). Let's pick positive for simplicity; the sign might not matter for distance.

So, coordinates:

P = (0, √32)

Now, need to find PS. Point S is at (-7, 0). So, distance PS is between (0, √32) and (-7, 0).

Calculating distance PS:

Δx = -7 - 0 = -7

Δy = 0 - √32 = -√32

So, distance PS squared is (-7)^2 + (-√32)^2 = 49 + 32 = 81. Hence, distance PS is √81 = 9. Wait, that gives PS = 9. Which is option B.

But wait, let me confirm again. Is my assumption about the position of P correct?

Because line RA passes through P. In this setup, P is on the y-axis. So line RA connects R(0,0) to A, passing through P(0, √32). So, line RA is the same as the y-axis. Thus, point A can be anywhere along the y-axis. But since P is on RA, it's okay. So regardless of where A is, as long as line RA is the y-axis, P is on it. So this setup satisfies all conditions.

Thus, PS is 9. So the answer is B. But let me check once more.

Wait, but why did they give the length SR = 7? Because in this setup, S is at (-7, 0), R at (0,0), so SR is indeed 7 units. All given lengths are satisfied.

Another thing to check: Perpendicularity. Line RP is from R(0,0) to P(0, √32), which is vertical. Line RQ is from R(0,0) to Q(7,0), which is horizontal. They are perpendicular. Correct.

So everything checks out. Therefore, PS is 9, which corresponds to answer choice B.

But wait, let me check if there's another possibility. What if R is not between S and Q? For instance, suppose S is on the extension of RQ beyond Q. Then SR would be longer than RQ. But given that SR is 7 and RQ is 7, that would require S being on the other side. Let me explore that scenario.

Suppose R is not between S and Q, but instead S is on the line extending from RQ beyond Q. So, imagine Q-----R-----S? No, because then QR is from Q to R, and RS would be from R to S. If QR is 7, then RS would be another length. Wait, but the problem says LengthOf(SR) is 7. So if S is on the line SQ, then if R is beyond Q, then SR would be SQ - QR? Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

If R is on line SQ, then SQ could be in different configurations. For example, S---Q---R, meaning that R is beyond Q from S. Then, SR would be SQ + QR. Given that SR = 7 and QR = 7, then SQ + 7 = 7 → SQ = 0, which is impossible. So that configuration isn't possible.

Alternatively, if S is between Q and R. So Q---S---R. Then, QR would be QS + SR. Given QR is 7, SR is 7, then QS = QR - SR = 7 - 7 = 0. Again, implying S coincides with Q, which is invalid. Therefore, the only valid configuration is when R is between S and Q, making SQ = SR + RQ = 7 + 7 = 14. Hence, the initial setup is correct.

Therefore, the coordinates assigned were correct, leading to PS = 9. So the answer is B. But wait, let me check again the calculation of PS.

Coordinates of P: (0, √32)

Coordinates of S: (-7, 0)

Distance PS:

sqrt[ (-7 - 0)^2 + (0 - √32)^2 ] = sqrt[49 + 32] = sqrt(81) = 9. Yes, that's correct. So PS is indeed 9. Therefore, answer is B.

But wait, looking back at the answer choices, option B is 9. So the answer should be B.

But let me check if there's another approach. For example, using vectors or similar triangles.

Alternatively, consider triangle PRQ with right angle at R. PQ is hypotenuse 9, legs QR = 7 and PR = sqrt(32). Then, coordinates method worked. Another way: Maybe using coordinates was the simplest path.

Yes, so conclusion remains. Final Answer is B.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by interpreting the geometric constraints and assigning appropriate coordinates to simplify computations.

### Step 1: Understanding the Geometric Setup

We are given:

- $ \text{Length}(PQ) = 9 $
- $ \text{Length}(QR) = 7 $
- $ \text{Length}(SR) = 7 $
- $ R $ lies on line $ SQ $
- $ P $ lies on line $ RA $
- Lines $ RP $ and $ RQ $ are **perpendicular**

Our goal is to compute $ PS $, i.e., the straight-line distance between points $ P $ and $ S $.

---

### Step 2: Coordinate Assignment

To simplify the situation, we place key points on a coordinate plane:

- Place point $ R $ at the origin: $ R = (0, 0) $
- Since $ RQ = 7 $ and $ RP \perp RQ $, place point $ Q $ on the positive x-axis: $ Q = (7, 0) $
- Since $ SR = 7 $, and $ R $ lies between $ S $ and $ Q $, place point $ S $ on the negative x-axis: $ S = (-7, 0) $

This ensures that:

- $ SR = 7 $
- $ RQ = 7 $
- $ R $ lies on line $ SQ $
- $ \angle PRQ = 90^\circ $ implies that $ PR $ is vertical, and $ RQ $ is horizontal

---

### Step 3: Determine Coordinates of $ P $

We are told that $ \text{Length}(PQ) = 9 $. Using the coordinates of $ Q = (7, 0) $, we can write:

$$
\text{Length}(PQ)^2 = (x_P - 7)^2 + (y_P - 0)^2 = 81
$$

Assuming $ P $ lies vertically above or below $ R $ (since $ PR \perp RQ $), its x-coordinate is 0. So, set $ P = (0, b) $. Substituting:

$$
(0 - 7)^2 + (b - 0)^2 = 81 \\
49 + b^2 = 81 \\
b^2 = 32 \Rightarrow b = \pm \sqrt{32}
$$

Take $ P = (0, \sqrt{32}) $ without loss of generality.

---

### Step 4: Compute Distance $ PS $

Now calculate the Euclidean distance between $ P = (0, \sqrt{32}) $ and $ S = (-7, 0) $:

$$
PS = \sqrt{(0 - (-7))^2 + (\sqrt{32} - 0)^2} = \sqrt{7^2 + (\sqrt{32})^2} = \sqrt{49 + 32} = \sqrt{81} = 9
$$

---

### Conclusion

All given constraints are satisfied with this configuration, and the computed value of $ PS = 9 $ matches one of the given answer choices.

$$
\boxed{\text{Final Answer: B}}
$$
