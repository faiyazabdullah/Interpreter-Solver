MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, we need to find the measure of arc IHJ, which is denoted as m∠I H J. Wait, no—actually, the question says "m ∠IHJ," but maybe that's a typo? Or perhaps it's referring to the arc measure. Let me check again.

Wait, the problem states: "Find m ∠IHJ." But angles can have measures, so maybe they mean angle IHJ? But then, how does that relate to arcs? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe there was a formatting issue, and they meant the arc measure for IHJ. Wait, the original question might have had a different notation. Let me re-read the problem carefully.

The problem says: "H K and I G are diameters of ⊙ L. Find m ∠IHJ." So, the angle at point H between points I and J. Wait, angle IHJ would be the angle at point H formed by points I, H, J. But since H is on the circle, and maybe some relationships here.

First, let's parse the given information:

- The measure of angle HLI (Angle(H, L, I)) is 59 degrees. Wait, Angle(H, L, I) means the angle at point L between points H and I. So, ∠HLI = 59°.

Then, several points lie on lines:

- Point L lies on line GI (since PointLiesOnLine(L, Line(G, I))? Wait, no—the wording is: "PointLiesOnLine(L, Line(G, I))". That would mean that point L is on the line connecting G and I. Similarly, point L is also on the line connecting H and K. Wait, hold on—that seems contradictory because L is a point, and if it's on both lines GI and HK, then those two lines intersect at L. Also, since H K and I G are diameters of circle L. Wait, the diameters are HK and IG. So, each diameter passes through the center of the circle. Since the circle is centered at L, right? Because the points H, K, I, G, J are on the circle with center L. So, the diameters HK and IG pass through the center L. Therefore, L is the center of the circle.

So, the circle has center L, and diameters HK and IG. So, points H and K are endpoints of one diameter, and points I and G are endpoints of another diameter. Therefore, HL and LK are radii? No, wait, HK is a diameter, so HL and LK would be half of that. Wait, since L is the center, then HL is a radius? Wait, no—if HK is a diameter, then the center is the midpoint of HK. But the problem says that L is the center. So, L is the midpoint of HK and also the midpoint of IG. Therefore, HL = LK, and IL = LG.

Moreover, since points H, K, I, G, J are on the circle with center L. So, all these points are on the circumference of the circle centered at L.

Also, there's a perpendicularity condition: Perpendicular(Line(L, J), Line(L, I)). So, the line LJ is perpendicular to the line LI. So, LI and LJ are perpendicular. Since L is the center, LI is a radius, and LJ is another radius. Therefore, the angle between LI and LJ is 90 degrees. So, angle I L J is 90 degrees. Therefore, the angle between vectors LI and LJ is 90 degrees. Which would imply that points I, L, J form a right angle at L. So, triangle I L J is a right-angled triangle at L.

But how does this help us?

We need to find the measure of angle IHJ. Wait, angle IHJ is the angle at point H between points I, H, J. So, vertex at H, with segments HI and HJ.

Let me try to visualize this. Let's sketch mentally:

- There is a circle with center L.

- Points H and K are endpoints of a diameter, so HK is a straight line passing through L.

- Points I and G are endpoints of another diameter, so IG is another straight line passing through L.

Therefore, the diameters HK and IG intersect at L, the center.

Additionally, point J is also on the circle. Also, line LJ is perpendicular to line LI. Since LI is part of diameter IG, which goes through L. So, LI is along the diameter IG. Then, line LJ is perpendicular to LI. Since LI is a radius pointing towards I, then LJ is a radius perpendicular to that direction.

So, starting from point L, moving along the direction of LI (towards I), then turning 90 degrees (perpendicular) gives the direction of LJ. Therefore, point J is located such that LJ is perpendicular to LI.

Now, we need to find the measure of angle IHJ. So, angle at H between I and J.

To find angle IHJ, maybe we can use properties of circles, inscribed angles, central angles, etc.

First, let's note that H is on the circle. Let me consider coordinates to make things clearer.

Let me assign coordinates to simplify. Let’s place the center L at the origin (0,0). Let’s assume the circle has radius r (but since specific lengths aren't given, maybe we can take r=1 for simplicity).

Since HK and IG are diameters. Let's define coordinates for the points:

- Let’s set up coordinate system with L at (0,0).

- Let’s suppose diameter HK is horizontal. Let’s say point H is (-a, 0) and K is (a, 0), making HK a horizontal diameter. Then, since L is the center, the distance from L to H is a, so radius is a.

Similarly, diameter IG could be vertical. Let’s say point I is (0, b) and G is (0, -b). But wait, since L is the center, the diameter IG should pass through L. So, points I and G are on opposite ends of the diameter. Therefore, if I is (0, b), then G is (0, -b). However, the exact positions may vary depending on orientation.

However, there is another condition: line LJ is perpendicular to line LI. Let me think about this.

Line LI connects points L(0,0) and I(0,b). So, vector LI is (0, b) - (0,0) = (0, b). Therefore, line LI is vertical. Therefore, line LJ must be horizontal, since it's perpendicular to LI. Therefore, line LJ is horizontal. So, since L is at (0,0), and line LJ is horizontal, then point J lies somewhere along the horizontal line through L. But since J is on the circle, its coordinates must satisfy x² + y² = a² (assuming radius a). If line LJ is horizontal, then y-coordinate of J is 0. Therefore, J is either (a, 0) or (-a, 0). But wait, those are points H and K. Wait, unless J is another point on the circle. Wait, but if line LJ is horizontal, then J lies on the x-axis. However, points H and K are already on the x-axis. Unless J coincides with H or K? But that's possible only if J is same as H or K, but the problem mentions J as a distinct point.

Alternatively, maybe my assumption of the position of I is wrong. Let me reconsider.

Suppose instead that diameter IG is not aligned vertically. Let me think differently.

Since line LJ is perpendicular to line LI, which is part of diameter IG. So, LI is a radius in the direction of point I. So, if I is some point on the circle, then LI is the radius from center L to I. Then, LJ is perpendicular to that radius. Therefore, point J is obtained by rotating the radius LI by 90 degrees around L. Depending on direction (clockwise or counterclockwise), J could be in different positions.

But regardless, the key thing is that angle between LI and LJ is 90 degrees.

Now, going back to the first given condition: MeasureOf(Angle(H, L, I)) is 59 degrees. So, angle at L between points H and I is 59 degrees. So, in terms of central angles, the angle between LH and LI is 59 degrees. Since LH and LI are both radii of the circle.

Therefore, the central angle ∠HLI is 59 degrees. So, in our coordinate system, if we imagine points H and I on the circle, the angle between them at the center is 59 degrees.

Given that HK and IG are diameters, meaning that points H and K are endpoints of one diameter, and I and G are endpoints of another diameter. Therefore, the angle between diameters HK and IG is determined by the angle between their directions.

Since ∠HLI is 59 degrees, which is the angle between radii LH and LI. So, if we imagine the circle with center L, point H is one endpoint of diameter HK, point I is one endpoint of diameter IG. So, the angle between the diameters HK and IG is 59 degrees.

Now, we need to find the measure of angle IHJ. Let me think about how to approach this.

Point J is on the circle, and line LJ is perpendicular to LI. So, as mentioned earlier, if LI is a radius, then LJ is another radius perpendicular to it. So, the direction of LJ is 90 degrees from LI. Therefore, the arc from I to J is 90 degrees, since the central angle between I and J is 90 degrees.

But how does this relate to angle IHJ?

Angle IHJ is an angle formed at point H, with sides HI and HJ. To find its measure, we can use the inscribed angle theorem or properties related to cyclic quadrilaterals or something else.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinates would help. Let me attempt to assign coordinates again.

Let me set up coordinates with L at (0,0). Let me assume radius r = 1 for simplicity.

Let me define point H as (-1, 0), since it's on the x-axis. Then, since HK is a diameter, point K is (1, 0).

Now, point I is another point on the circle such that angle HLI is 59 degrees. Since H is at (-1, 0), and L is at (0,0), the angle between LH and LI is 59 degrees. Vector LH is from L to H: (-1, 0). Vector LI is from L to I: let's denote point I as (x,y) on the unit circle, so x² + y² = 1. The angle between vectors LH and LI is 59 degrees.

The formula for the angle θ between two vectors u and v is cosθ = (u · v)/(|u||v|). Here, u = LH = (-1, 0), v = LI = (x, y). The dot product is (-1)(x) + 0*(y) = -x. The magnitudes |u| and |v| are both 1, since it's the unit circle. Therefore,

cos(59°) = -x / (1 * 1) => x = -cos(59°)

So, the x-coordinate of point I is -cos(59°). Let me compute that numerically. Cos(59°) ≈ 0.5150. Therefore, x ≈ -0.5150. Then, y^2 = 1 - x² ≈ 1 - (0.515)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.265 ≈ 0.735, so y ≈ sqrt(0.735) ≈ 0.857 or -0.857. Assuming the diagram is drawn in a way that angle HLI is measured in a particular orientation, let's assume y is positive. So, point I is approximately (-0.515, 0.857).

Now, since IG is a diameter, point G is diametrically opposite to I. So, if I is (-0.515, 0.857), then G is the reflection over the center L(0,0), so G = (0.515, -0.857).

Next, we have point J on the circle such that line LJ is perpendicular to line LI. Since LI is the vector from L(0,0) to I(-0.515, 0.857). The slope of LI is (0.857)/(-0.515) ≈ -1.665. Therefore, the line LJ must be perpendicular to this, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: 1/1.665 ≈ 0.6. Alternatively, since vectors LI and LJ are perpendicular, their dot product is zero.

Vector LI is (-0.515, 0.857). Let vector LJ be (a, b), which is a radius vector. Since J is on the circle, a² + b² = 1. Their dot product is (-0.515)*a + 0.857*b = 0. So:

-0.515a + 0.857b = 0 → 0.857b = 0.515a → b = (0.515 / 0.857)a ≈ (0.6)a.

So, b ≈ 0.6a. And since a² + b² = 1, substituting:

a² + (0.6a)^2 = a² + 0.36a² = 1.36a² = 1 → a² = 1 / 1.36 ≈ 0.735 → a ≈ ±√0.735 ≈ ±0.857.

Therefore, if a is positive, then b ≈ 0.6*0.857 ≈ 0.514. So, point J would be approximately (0.857, 0.514). Alternatively, if a is negative, then b ≈ 0.6*(-0.857) ≈ -0.514, giving point J as (-0.857, -0.514). 

But since we're dealing with angle IHJ, we need to determine which position of J makes sense. Let me see. The problem didn't specify the direction of the perpendicular, so there could be two possibilities. However, based on the given information, perhaps we can figure out which one it is.

Alternatively, maybe we can use complex numbers or rotation matrices to find point J. Since LI is a vector, and LJ is perpendicular to it. Rotating vector LI by 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise would give the direction of LJ.

In general, rotating a vector (x, y) by 90 degrees counterclockwise gives (-y, x). Rotating clockwise gives (y, -x). 

Original vector LI is from L(0,0) to I(-0.515, 0.857). So, vector LI is (-0.515, 0.857). Rotating this by 90 degrees counterclockwise would give (-0.857, -0.515). Rotating clockwise would give (0.857, 0.515). 

So, point J could be at either (-0.857, -0.515) or (0.857, 0.515). Let me check which one fits. 

If we take the clockwise rotation, then J is at (0.857, 0.515). This point is in the first quadrant. Alternatively, the counterclockwise rotation gives J in third quadrant. Depending on the diagram, but since angle IHJ is likely to be formed in a certain way, but without more info, maybe both positions are possible. However, the problem statement may have constraints that determine the correct position.

But let's proceed with one possibility. Let's pick J as (0.857, 0.515). Now, we need to compute angle IHJ, i.e., angle at H between points I, H, J.

Points:

- H is (-1, 0)

- I is (-0.515, 0.857)

- J is (0.857, 0.515)

We need to find angle at H between I and J.

To compute this angle, we can use vectors. At point H, vectors HI and HJ.

First, find vectors HI and HJ.

Vector HI = I - H = [(-0.515 - (-1)), (0.857 - 0)] = (0.485, 0.857)

Vector HJ = J - H = [(0.857 - (-1)), (0.515 - 0)] = (1.857, 0.515)

Now, the angle between vectors HI and HJ is the angle IHJ. We can compute this angle using the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (HI · HJ) / (|HI| |HJ| )

Compute HI · HJ:

(0.485)(1.857) + (0.857)(0.515) ≈ Let's calculate:

First term: 0.485 * 1.857 ≈ approx 0.485*1.857. Let me compute 0.485 * 1.8 = 0.873, 0.485 * 0.057 ≈ ~0.0277. Total ≈ 0.873 + 0.0277 ≈ 0.9007

Second term: 0.857 * 0.515 ≈ approx 0.857 * 0.5 = 0.4285, plus 0.857 * 0.015 ≈ 0.01285 → total ≈ 0.4285 + 0.01285 ≈ 0.44135

Total dot product ≈ 0.9007 + 0.44135 ≈ 1.342

Now compute |HI|:

|HI| = sqrt( (0.485)^2 + (0.857)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(0.235 + 0.734) ≈ sqrt(0.969) ≈ 0.984

|HJ| = sqrt( (1.857)^2 + (0.515)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(3.449 + 0.265) ≈ sqrt(3.714) ≈ 1.927

Thus, cos(theta) ≈ 1.342 / (0.984 * 1.927) ≈ 1.342 / (1.897) ≈ 0.707

Which corresponds to theta ≈ arccos(0.707) ≈ 45 degrees. Wait, arccos(√2/2) is 45°, and √2/2 ≈ 0.707. So, this suggests that angle IHJ is approximately 45 degrees. But none of the answer choices include 45. Wait, the answer choices are 59, 135, 270, 301. So, that's conflicting. Did I make a mistake?

Alternatively, maybe I chose the wrong position for J. Let me try the other possibility where J is at (-0.857, -0.515). Let me recalculate.

Point J: (-0.857, -0.515). Then vector HJ is J - H = (-0.857 - (-1), -0.515 - 0) = (0.143, -0.515)

Vector HI remains the same: (0.485, 0.857)

Dot product HI · HJ = (0.485)(0.143) + (0.857)(-0.515)

Calculate:

First term: 0.485 * 0.143 ≈ 0.0693

Second term: 0.857 * (-0.515) ≈ -0.441

Total ≈ 0.0693 - 0.441 ≈ -0.3717

Now, |HI| is still approx 0.984

|HJ| is sqrt( (0.143)^2 + (-0.515)^2 ) ≈ sqrt(0.020 + 0.265) ≈ sqrt(0.285) ≈ 0.534

So cos(theta) ≈ -0.3717 / (0.984 * 0.534) ≈ -0.3717 / 0.525 ≈ -0.707

Which would correspond to theta ≈ 135 degrees (since cos(135°) = -√2/2 ≈ -0.707). Ah! So this gives angle IHJ ≈ 135 degrees. Which matches option B (135). So that's promising.

But why did choosing the other J give us 45 degrees? Maybe because of the position of J relative to H and I.

But why is this happening? Let me think again.

If J is in the third quadrant, then when you connect H to J, the angle at H between I and J becomes larger. Whereas if J were in the first quadrant, the angle might be smaller. Given that the answer choices include 135, which is plausible.

So, according to this calculation, the measure of angle IHJ is approximately 135 degrees, which is option B. But let me verify this with another method, perhaps using circle theorems rather than coordinates, to confirm.

Alternative approach:

We know that angle IHJ is an inscribed angle. But inscribed angles subtend arcs. However, angle at H, so maybe it's related to arcs involving points I, J, and others.

Alternatively, since H is on the circle, and we have various diameters.

Let me recall that angle IHJ is formed by chords HI and HJ. The measure of this angle depends on the arcs it subtends.

But to apply the inscribed angle theorem, we need to identify the arc that it subtends. For an angle formed by two chords meeting at a point on the circumference, the measure is half the difference of the intercepted arcs.

Wait, yes. The formula for the measure of an angle formed by two chords intersecting at a point on the circumference is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

Specifically, if you have angle IHJ, then it intercepts arcs IJ and... Well, actually, the angle at H between I and J intercepts the arc from I to J that does not contain H. Wait, no. Let me recall the exact theorem.

The measure of an angle formed by two chords with vertex on the circle is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc. Wait, no. Wait, if the angle is inside the circle, it's half the sum; if outside, half the difference. But if the vertex is on the circle, it's an inscribed angle and equals half the measure of the intercepted arc.

Wait, but angle IHJ is at point H, which is on the circle. So, the angle is an inscribed angle intercepting arc IJ. Wait, but inscribed angles intercept arcs opposite to the angle. Wait, if the angle is at H, then it intercepts arc IJ that does not include H. So, the measure of angle IHJ would be half the measure of arc IJ.

But wait, in this case, arc IJ. So, if we can find the measure of arc IJ, then divide by 2 to get angle IHJ.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again.

Actually, the inscribed angle theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. In this case, angle IHJ is an inscribed angle intercepting arc IJ. So, measure of angle IHJ = ½ × measure of arc IJ.

Therefore, if we can find the measure of arc IJ, then multiply by ½ to get the angle.

So, how do we find arc IJ?

Well, we know that point J is positioned such that LJ is perpendicular to LI. Since L is the center, the central angle between I and J is 90 degrees. Therefore, arc IJ measures 90 degrees. Thus, the inscribed angle intercepting arc IJ would be ½ × 90° = 45°, but this contradicts our previous result. Wait, but earlier calculation gave us 135°, so there's inconsistency here. Where is the mistake?

Ah! Wait, the intercepted arc might not be the minor arc IJ. It depends on the position of the angle. If the angle is at H, then the intercepted arc could be the major arc IJ instead of the minor arc. Because the angle is formed by points I, H, J, and depending on the location of H, the intercepted arc could be the one that's opposite.

For example, if H is on the circle, and the angle at H is formed by HI and HJ, then the intercepted arc is the arc IJ that does NOT contain H. However, depending on where H is located, this arc could be the major arc or minor arc. If the angle is obtuse, then the intercepted arc would be greater than 180°, hence the angle would be half of that, leading to an obtuse angle.

So, if arc IJ is 90°, but the angle at H intercepts the major arc IJ, then the measure would be ½ × (360° - 90°) = ½ × 270° = 135°, which matches our previous result. Hence, angle IHJ is 135°, which is option B.

So, why does this happen? Because even though the central angle between I and J is 90°, the angle at H intercepts the major arc IJ instead of the minor arc. So, the intercepted arc is 360° - 90° = 270°, and half of that is 135°.

Therefore, the measure of angle IHJ is 135°, corresponding to option B.

But how do we know that the intercepted arc is the major arc IJ?

Because point H is located such that it's not on the minor arc IJ. Let me think about the configuration. Points I and J are separated by 90°, as per the central angle. Point H is on the circle, and since angle HLI is 59°, which is the central angle between H and I. So, the position of H is such that it's not on the arc IJ. Therefore, the angle at H intercepts the major arc IJ.

Let me confirm this with the coordinate example. Earlier, in the coordinate system, point H was at (-1, 0), point I was at (-0.515, 0.857), and point J was at (-0.857, -0.515). The arc from I to J that doesn't contain H would go the long way around the circle. Since H is on the left side, while I and J are on upper left and lower left respectively. The arc from I to J not containing H would pass through the bottom-right of the circle, making a large arc. Hence, the intercepted arc is indeed the major arc, leading to 135°.

Therefore, the measure of angle IHJ is 135°, so the correct answer is B.

Another way to look at it: Since angle IHJ is formed by two chords HI and HJ, with H on the circle. The central angle between I and J is 90°, so the major arc IJ is 270°, and the inscribed angle over that arc is half, so 135°. Therefore, the answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the geometric setup:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**

We are told that:
- $ HK $ and $ IG $ are diameters of $ \odot L $, meaning both pass through the center $ L $.
- $ \angle HLI = 59^\circ $. This tells us that the central angle between radii $ LH $ and $ LI $ is $ 59^\circ $, so the arc $ HI $ measures $ 59^\circ $.
- $ LJ \perp LI $, implying that $ \angle JLI = 90^\circ $, so the arc $ IJ $ measures $ 90^\circ $.

All points $ H, K, I, G, J $ lie on the circle with center $ L $, and thus all are equidistant from $ L $.

---

### **Step 2: Determine the Arc Intercepted by $ \angle IHJ $**

We are asked to find the measure of $ \angle IHJ $, which is an **inscribed angle** with vertex at $ H $ and sides $ HI $ and $ HJ $.

By the **Inscribed Angle Theorem**, the measure of an inscribed angle is **half the measure of the arc it intercepts**.

To find which arc $ \angle IHJ $ intercepts, observe:
- $ \angle IHJ $ lies at point $ H $.
- The angle is formed by chords $ HI $ and $ HJ $, so it intercepts the arc $ IJ $ **not containing point $ H $**.

From earlier, we established that the **central angle** between $ I $ and $ J $ is $ 90^\circ $, so the **minor arc $ IJ $** measures $ 90^\circ $. The remaining arc (the **major arc**) measures:
$$
360^\circ - 90^\circ = 270^\circ
$$

This is the arc that $ \angle IHJ $ intercepts.

---

### **Step 3: Compute the Inscribed Angle**

Using the Inscribed Angle Theorem:
$$
\text{Measure of } \angle IHJ = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{measure of arc } IJ) = \frac{1}{2} \times 270^\circ = 135^\circ
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

The measure of $ \angle IHJ $ is therefore $ 135^\circ $.

$$
\boxed{\text{Final Answer: B}}
$$
