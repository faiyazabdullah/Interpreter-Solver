MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have points A, B, and C. The problem gives some constraints:

First, the length of line BC is y. Then, the length of line AC is x. The length of AB is 14√3. The angle at point B (angle CBA) is 30 degrees. Also, lines AB and AC are perpendicular. Wait, hold on—perpendicular means they form a right angle. But wait, if AB and AC are perpendicular, then triangle ABC would have a right angle at A? Because AB and AC are two sides meeting at A. Wait, but the angle given is at point B. Let me clarify.

Wait, the angle measure is MeasureOf(Angle(C, B, A)), which is angle at B between points C, B, A. So that's angle ABC, which is 30 degrees. And also, lines AB and AC are perpendicular. Wait, AB and AC are two sides of the triangle. If AB and AC are perpendicular, then angle at A is 90 degrees. Wait, but then angle at B is 30 degrees. So triangle ABC has angles at A = 90°, at B = 30°, so angle at C would be 60°, since angles sum to 180°.

But let me check again. The problem says Perpendicular(Line(A,B), Line(A,C)). That means lines AB and AC are perpendicular. Therefore, angle at A is 90 degrees. So triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at A, with angle at B being 30 degrees. Therefore, angle at C would be 60 degrees.

So, given that, we can use trigonometric ratios to find the lengths.

Let me draw triangle ABC. Right-angled at A. So AB and AC are legs, BC is hypotenuse. Wait, no—if it's right-angled at A, then BC is the hypotenuse. But the problem says that LengthOf(Line(A,B)) is 14√3. So AB is one leg, AC is another leg, BC is hypotenuse.

But the problem states that angle at B is 30 degrees. In a right-angled triangle, the angles are related to the sides. Since angle at B is 30°, then side opposite to angle B is AC. Because in triangle ABC, angle at B is opposite to AC. Wait, let me think.

In triangle ABC, angle at B is 30°, right angle at A. So the sides:

Opposite angle A (right angle) is BC, which is the hypotenuse.

Opposite angle B (30°) is AC.

Opposite angle C (which is 60°) is AB.

Therefore, using standard right-triangle ratios for 30-60-90 triangles.

In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. Where the side opposite 30° is the shortest side, then opposite 60° is √3 times that, and hypotenuse is twice the shortest side.

Here, angle B is 30°, so AC is opposite angle B, so AC is the shorter leg. AB is opposite angle C (which is 60°), so AB is longer leg. Hypotenuse BC is twice the shorter leg.

Given that AB is 14√3. Wait, AB is the longer leg here because it's opposite the 60° angle. So if AB is longer leg, then AC is shorter leg.

Let me denote:

Let’s call AB = longer leg = 14√3.

Then, shorter leg AC = ?

Hypotenuse BC = ?

In a 30-60-90 triangle, longer leg = shorter leg * √3. So:

AB = AC * √3 → 14√3 = AC * √3 → AC = 14. Therefore, AC = 14. Which is x. Wait, but the question asks for y, which is BC. The hypotenuse.

Since hypotenuse is twice the shorter leg. Shorter leg is AC = 14. Therefore, BC = 2*14 = 28. Therefore, y = 28. So answer should be option C.

Wait, let me confirm once again. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the sides.

Angle at B is 30°, so the side opposite to angle B is AC. So AC is opposite 30°, meaning it's the shorter leg. Then AB is adjacent to angle B, which is the longer leg. So yes, AB is longer leg. So AB = longer leg = 14√3, so shorter leg AC = AB / √3 = (14√3)/√3 = 14. Then hypotenuse BC = 2*shorter leg = 28. Hence y = 28. So answer is C.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute using trigonometry. For example, in triangle ABC, right-angled at A. So tan(angle at B) = opposite/adjacent = AC / AB. Angle at B is 30°, so tan(30°) = AC / AB. Tan(30°) is 1/√3. Therefore, 1/√3 = AC / AB → AC = AB / √3 = (14√3)/√3 = 14. Then, BC can be found via Pythagoras: AB² + AC² = BC². So (14√3)^2 + 14^2 = BC². Compute:

(14√3)^2 = 196 * 3 = 588

14^2 = 196

Total BC² = 588 + 196 = 784 → BC = sqrt(784) = 28. Yep, same result. So y = 28. So answer is C.

Looking at the options, C is 28. Therefore, the correct answer is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ y $, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration based on the given constraints:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Triangle Configuration**

We are told:

- $ \text{Length}(AB) = 14\sqrt{3} $
- $ \angle ABC = 30^\circ $
- Lines $ AB $ and $ AC $ are **perpendicular**, implying that triangle $ ABC $ is a **right triangle** with the right angle at vertex $ A $.
  
Thus, triangle $ ABC $ is a **30°–60°–90° right triangle**, with the right angle at $ A $, and angle at $ B $ equal to $ 30^\circ $. This makes angle at $ C = 60^\circ $, as the angles of a triangle always add up to $ 180^\circ $.

---

### **Step 2: Use Properties of 30°–60°–90° Triangles**

In such triangles, the sides are in the fixed ratio:

$$
\text{Shortest leg (opposite } 30^\circ): \quad \text{Longest leg (opposite } 60^\circ): \quad \text{Hypotenuse}
= 1 : \sqrt{3} : 2
$$

From the given:

- Side $ AB $ is opposite angle $ C $, which is $ 60^\circ $ → **longer leg**
- Side $ AC $ is opposite angle $ B $, which is $ 30^\circ $ → **shorter leg**
- Side $ BC $ is the **hypotenuse**

---

### **Step 3: Assign Values Based on Ratios**

Let’s define:

- Let $ AB = 14\sqrt{3} $ (given)
- Since $ AB $ corresponds to the longer leg, and it is $ \sqrt{3} $ times the shorter leg ($ AC $):

$$
AB = AC \cdot \sqrt{3} \Rightarrow 14\sqrt{3} = AC \cdot \sqrt{3} \Rightarrow AC = 14
$$

Now, compute the hypotenuse $ BC $ using the property that it is **twice the shorter leg**:

$$
BC = 2 \times AC = 2 \times 14 = 28
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

The length of segment $ BC $, which is denoted as $ y $, equals $ 28 $.

$$
\boxed{\text{Final Answer: C}}
$$
