MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have several angles given in terms of x, and we need to find the measure of angle H. Let me start by writing down all the given information so I can visualize it better.

First, the problem mentions angles at different points:

1. Measure of Angle(E, F, G) is x + 20. That would be angle EFG, right? Wait, the notation might be important here. In angle notation, the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(E, F, G) means the angle at point F between points E and G. So that's ∠EFG, with vertex at F.

Similarly, Angle(F, E, J) is x. So that's ∠FEJ, with vertex at E. Then Angle(J, H, G) is x - 5, which is ∠JHG with vertex at H. Angle(E, J, H) is x + 10, so that's ∠EJH with vertex at J. And finally, Angle(F, G, H) is x + 5, so ∠FGH with vertex at G.

Wait, but how do these angles relate to each other? Are they part of a triangle or some polygon? Maybe there's a diagram that goes along with this, but since I don't have it, I need to infer based on the angle labels.

Let me try to sketch a rough diagram mentally. Let's assume points E, F, G, H, J are connected in such a way that these angles make sense. Maybe there's a pentagon or something else?

Alternatively, perhaps these angles form parts of triangles or intersecting lines. Let me think about possible configurations.

Looking at the angles given:

Starting with ∠EFG (x + 20), which is at point F. Then ∠FEJ (x) is also at point E. Hmm. Maybe points E, F, J are connected? Also, there's ∠JHG (x -5) at H, and ∠EJH (x +10) at J. And ∠FGH (x +5) at G.

This seems complex. Maybe there are multiple triangles involved. Let me see if I can find relationships between these angles using triangle angle sums or maybe straight line angles.

Let me consider possible triangles. For example, looking at triangle EFG. If we know two angles, maybe we can find others? But wait, I only know ∠EFG = x + 20. Not sure yet.

Wait, another approach: Since angles around a point sum up to 360 degrees, or angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees. Maybe I can find equations based on those.

But first, I need to determine which angles are related. Let me check for triangles that share sides or vertices.

For instance, considering triangle FEJ. The angle at E is ∠FEJ = x. What about other angles? If I can find other angles in that triangle, maybe.

Also, looking at ∠EJH = x +10, which is at J. And ∠JHG = x -5, which is at H. So maybe triangle JHG? Or triangle EJH?

Let me try to look for triangles involving these angles. Suppose we have triangle EJH. In that triangle, we have ∠EJH = x +10. What about the other angles? Maybe ∠JEH and ∠JHE?

Wait, but ∠FEJ is at E, which could be adjacent to ∠JEH if points F, E, J are colinear? Wait, no. If ∠FEJ is at E, then EF and EJ are two sides forming that angle. So if there's another angle at E, like ∠JEH, then maybe they are adjacent?

Alternatively, maybe there's a quadrilateral or something else.

Alternatively, maybe points E, F, G, H, J are arranged in a certain way. Let me try to imagine that E-F-G-H-J-E forms a polygon, but that may not hold.

Alternatively, think about transversal lines and parallel lines, but without knowing if lines are parallel, that's hard.

Another idea: Maybe all these angles are part of a larger polygon, like a pentagon, and we can use the formula for the sum of interior angles. However, a pentagon has 540 degrees total. But without knowing which angles are which, it's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe there are multiple triangles sharing common sides, allowing us to set up equations.

Let me try focusing on specific triangles. Let's take triangle EFG. We know angle at F is x + 20. If we can find other angles in that triangle, maybe we can relate them.

But to find other angles in triangle EFG, we need more info. Perhaps there are other angles connected to F or G?

Looking at ∠FGH = x +5, which is at G. So angle at G between F and H. So if we consider triangle FGH, we have angle at G as x +5. But again, need more angles there.

Wait, maybe there's a quadrilateral FGHE or something similar. Alternatively, maybe lines FH and EG intersect at some point?

Alternatively, think about the angles around point E, F, G, H, etc.

Let me think about the angles at point E. There's ∠FEJ = x. Is there another angle at E? Like, if there's a line from E to H, making another angle?

Alternatively, suppose there's a triangle EFG and another triangle EJH. Maybe connected through point E?

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to realize that some of these angles are supplementary or vertical angles, or part of linear pairs.

Alternatively, maybe considering that the sum of angles around a point equals 360°, but unless we know which points are connected.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me try to write down all the angles and see if I can find relations.

Given:

1. ∠EFG = x + 20 (at F)
2. ∠FEJ = x (at E)
3. ∠JHG = x - 5 (at H)
4. ∠EJH = x + 10 (at J)
5. ∠FGH = x + 5 (at G)

We need to find m∠H. Which angle is ∠H referring to? The question says "Find m∠H". Assuming that ∠H refers to ∠JHG or ∠JHK or something else? Wait, in the given angles, there's ∠JHG = x -5, which is at H. So maybe ∠H refers to that angle? Or maybe another angle at H?

Wait, the problem says "Find m∠H", so probably ∠H is one of the angles mentioned. Given that there's ∠JHG (which is at H), and possibly another angle at H. For example, if there's a point H connected to other points, like maybe ∠EHJ or something.

Wait, let me check the angles given. The fifth angle is ∠FGH = x +5, which is at G. So maybe there's a triangle involving H and G?

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle at H. For example, if points J, H, G form a triangle, then ∠JHG is x -5, and maybe other angles in that triangle.

Let me consider triangle JHG. In that triangle, we have ∠JHG = x -5 (at H). If we can find other angles in that triangle, we can relate them.

But to do that, we need to know more angles. For example, if there's another angle at G or J in that triangle.

Wait, looking back, there's ∠FGH = x +5 at G. If points F, G, H are connected, then maybe ∠FGH is part of triangle FGH or something else. If we can connect that to triangle JHG...

Alternatively, maybe there's a straight line at point G? For instance, if points F, G, H are colinear, then ∠FGH would be a straight angle, but that's unlikely because it's given as x +5, implying it's not 180 degrees.

Alternatively, maybe lines EH and FG intersect at some point?

This is quite challenging without seeing the diagram. Let me try to consider that maybe these angles belong to different triangles connected via common sides.

Another thought: Since there are angles at E, F, G, H, J, maybe these points form a pentagon? Let's say E-F-G-H-J-E. Then the sum of interior angles of a pentagon is (5-2)*180 = 540 degrees. But we have angles given at various vertices. However, the problem gives angles that aren't necessarily the interior angles of the pentagon. For example, ∠EFG is an interior angle if the pentagon is convex. But if that's the case, then maybe adding all given angles would give some relation?

But let me check. If assuming the pentagon E-F-G-H-J-E, then the interior angles would be at each vertex. However, the given angles include ∠EFG (vertex F), ∠FEJ (vertex E), ∠JHG (vertex H), ∠EJH (vertex J), and ∠FGH (vertex G). Wait, but ∠FEJ is at E, which would be part of the interior angle at E. Similarly, ∠EJH is at J, which would be part of the interior angle at J. But then, how does this fit?

If that's the case, then the sum of all interior angles would be the sum of all these angles plus others? Wait, maybe not. Because each interior angle at a vertex is made up of multiple angles depending on the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the given angles are not the entire interior angles but parts of them.

Alternatively, maybe there are triangles formed within the pentagon, leading to multiple equations.

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves a star-shaped figure or something else.

Alternatively, think about triangle EFG and triangle EJH. Let me try focusing on triangle EFG first.

In triangle EFG, the angles are at E, F, G. We know angle at F is x +20. If we can express the other angles in terms of x, then we can use the fact that their sum is 180 degrees.

But to find the other angles, we need more information. For example, if there's a relationship between angles at E and G.

Wait, at point E, there's ∠FEJ = x. If line EJ is extending from E, then maybe that splits the angle at E into parts. For example, if there's a line from E to J, creating ∠FEJ (between E-F and E-J), and maybe another angle at E.

But without knowing if there's another line, it's tricky.

Wait, maybe there's a triangle EFG and another triangle EJH connected via point E and J?

Alternatively, think about the angles at point J. There's ∠EJH = x +10 (at J). If we consider triangle EJH, then the angles are at E, J, H. So in triangle EJH, angle at J is x +10. If we can find other angles in that triangle, we can get equations.

But again, needing more info. For example, if we can find angles at E or H in triangle EJH.

At point E, there's ∠FEJ = x. If that angle is part of triangle EJH, then maybe ∠FEJ is adjacent to another angle?

Alternatively, maybe line EJ is a side of both triangle EFG and triangle EJH.

Wait, this is getting too vague. Let me try another approach. Since all the given angles involve variables x, maybe I can set up equations based on the assumption that certain angles are supplementary or part of a triangle.

Let me consider the possibility that points E, F, G, H, J lie on a straight line or form intersecting lines. For example, if lines EF and GH intersect at some point, creating vertical angles.

Alternatively, think about the sum of angles around a point. For example, if several angles meet at a single point, their measures add up to 360 degrees.

Wait, let me check if there are any points where multiple angles meet. For example, at point E, there's ∠FEJ = x. At point F, there's ∠EFG = x +20. At point G, ∠FGH = x +5. At point H, ∠JHG = x -5. At point J, ∠EJH = x +10.

Maybe there are lines connecting these points, and the angles at each point are related. For example, if there's a line going through E-F-G and another through J-H-G, or something like that.

Alternatively, think about the angles at point H. There's ∠JHG = x -5. If there's another angle at H, say ∠EHJ, then together they might form a straight line or something.

Suppose that points E, H, J are connected, forming a line. Then ∠EHJ would be a straight angle, so ∠EHJ + ∠JHG = 180°. But ∠EHJ would be adjacent to ∠JHG if they are on a straight line.

Wait, if that's the case, then ∠EHJ + ∠JHG = 180°. But ∠EHJ is not directly given. However, maybe ∠EHJ relates to other angles.

Alternatively, if there's a triangle involving H, like triangle EHG or something.

Alternatively, think about triangle EFG and triangle FGH. Let me try to consider triangle FGH. In triangle FGH, we have angle at G: ∠FGH = x +5. If we can find other angles in that triangle, maybe relating to other angles.

But again, need more info. Let me think if there's a way to link these angles.

Wait, here's an idea: Let's suppose that points E, F, G, H, J form a pentagon, and the given angles are internal angles. Then, the sum of internal angles should be 540°. But let's check:

Sum of given angles: 

∠EFG (F): x +20

∠FEJ (E): x

∠JHG (H): x -5

∠EJH (J): x +10

∠FGH (G): x +5

Wait, but in a pentagon, each vertex has one internal angle. However, the given angles are not necessarily the internal angles. For example, ∠FEJ is at point E, which might be part of the internal angle at E. Similarly for others. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to tell.

However, if we assume that these five angles are the internal angles of the pentagon, then their sum would be 540°. So:

(x +20) + x + (x -5) + (x +10) + (x +5) = 540

Let me compute that:

Combine like terms:

x + 20 + x + x -5 + x +10 + x +5

Total x terms: 5x

Constants: 20 -5 +10 +5 = 30

So equation: 5x + 30 = 540 → 5x = 510 → x = 102.

Then, the value of x is 102. Now, the question asks for m∠H. Which angle is ∠H? If ∠H refers to ∠JHG, which was given as x -5, then substituting x=102, we get 102 -5 = 97. So answer would be A. 97.

But wait, is this valid? Because I assumed that all the given angles are the internal angles of the pentagon. However, the problem didn't specify that. It just gave angles at different points. But maybe that's the intended approach.

Alternatively, maybe some of the given angles are not the internal angles. For example, ∠FEJ is at point E, but if the pentagon's internal angle at E includes ∠FEJ and other angles. However, if we assume that each of the given angles is one of the internal angles, then this approach works.

But let me verify if this makes sense. Let me check if the angles add up correctly.

If x=102, then:

∠EFG = 102 + 20 = 122

∠FEJ = 102

∠JHG = 102 -5 = 97

∠EJH = 102 +10 = 112

∠FGH = 102 +5 = 107

Adding these: 122 + 102 + 97 + 112 + 107 = ?

Calculate step by step:

122 + 102 = 224

224 + 97 = 321

321 + 112 = 433

433 + 107 = 540. Yes! Exactly the sum of internal angles of a pentagon. So this suggests that my assumption is correct.

Therefore, x = 102. Hence, m∠H refers to ∠JHG = x -5 = 102 -5 = 97. So answer is A.

But wait, the answer choices include option A as 97. However, sometimes problems can have trick questions. Let me double-check if ∠H actually refers to ∠JHG. The question says "Find m∠H." Depending on the diagram, ∠H could refer to different angles. For example, if H is a vertex, then ∠H could be the angle at H, which would be ∠JHG if the angle is between J, H, G. So yes, that's likely.

But just to be thorough, let me check if there's another angle at H. For example, if there's another angle at H, like ∠EHJ or something else. But in the given angles, there's only ∠JHG = x -5. Unless there's another angle at H that isn't listed, but according to the problem statement, the given constraints are the ones listed. Therefore, the measure of ∠H is x -5 = 97, so answer A.

But wait, the answer choices include option A as 97, which matches. But let me check if there's a mistake in assuming that all given angles are the internal angles of the pentagon. For example, ∠FEJ is at point E, which is part of the pentagon, but if the internal angle at E is composed of multiple angles. However, in the absence of a diagram, this is the most logical assumption given the information.

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let's suppose that the angles given are parts of different triangles and we need to use triangle angle sums.

For example, let's take triangle EFG. Let me assume that ∠EFG = x +20, and if there's another angle at E or G.

But without knowing the other angles, it's difficult. However, if we consider that ∠FEJ = x is at point E, and maybe that's part of triangle EFG.

Wait, if line EJ intersects with FG somewhere, creating triangles. This is getting too speculative.

Alternatively, think about the fact that when you have multiple angles meeting at a point, their sum is 360 degrees. For example, if several angles meet at point E or F or G.

But again, without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to apply.

However, the earlier method worked perfectly, giving x=102 and resulting in ∠H being 97, which is option A. But let me cross-verify with another approach.

Alternative approach: Assume that the points form a pentagon, and the given angles are its internal angles. As above, solving gives x=102. Thus, m∠H = x -5 = 97. So answer A.

But why is the answer not among the options? Wait, no, option A is 97. So that's possible.

But let me check if there's another interpretation. For example, maybe ∠H refers to another angle. Suppose that ∠H is the external angle or something else. But given that the answer comes out cleanly with this method, and the sum checks out, I think this is the correct path.

Thus, Final Answer: A.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by carefully analyzing the given angular constraints and identifying the relationships between the angles. Each angle is defined using three-letter notation, indicating the vertex of the angle lies in the middle. Here’s a breakdown of the given constraints:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Given Angles**
From the problem, we are told:

1. $ \text{m} \angle EFG = x + 20 $
2. $ \text{m} \angle FEJ = x $
3. $ \text{m} \angle JHG = x - 5 $
4. $ \text{m} \angle EJH = x + 10 $
5. $ \text{m} \angle FGH = x + 5 $

These represent the measures of various angles in a geometric figure — likely a **pentagon**, as there are five distinct angles specified, and the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is known.

---

### **Step 2: Sum of Interior Angles of a Pentagon**
The formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with $ n $ sides is:

$$
\text{Sum} = (n - 2) \cdot 180^\circ
$$

For a pentagon ($ n = 5 $):

$$
\text{Sum} = (5 - 2) \cdot 180^\circ = 540^\circ
$$

Now, let’s sum up the expressions for the given angles:

$$
(x + 20) + x + (x - 5) + (x + 10) + (x + 5)
$$

Simplify the expression:

$$
x + 20 + x + x - 5 + x + 10 + x + 5 = 5x + 30
$$

Set equal to the total interior angle sum of the pentagon:

$$
5x + 30 = 540
$$

---

### **Step 3: Solve for $ x $**

$$
5x = 540 - 30 = 510 \\
x = \frac{510}{5} = 102
$$

---

### **Step 4: Find $ \text{m} \angle H $**

We are asked to find $ \text{m} \angle H $. Looking at the given angles, the only angle explicitly involving point $ H $ is:

$$
\angle JHG = x - 5
$$

Substitute $ x = 102 $:

$$
\text{m} \angle H = 102 - 5 = 97
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

Since the angle at $ H $ is represented by $ \angle JHG = x - 5 $, and we've determined $ x = 102 $, the measure of $ \angle H $ is:

$$
\boxed{97}
$$

---

**Final Answer:**  
$\boxed{A}$
