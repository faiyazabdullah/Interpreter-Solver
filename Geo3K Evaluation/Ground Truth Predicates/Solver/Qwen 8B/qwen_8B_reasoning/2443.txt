MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we need to find the measure of angle 1, which is denoted as ∠1. The given information includes several angles and some perpendicular lines. Let me start by listing out all the given constraints to visualize the diagram better.

First, the problem states that:

- Angle at R (Angle(R, Q, S)) is equal to angle 2. So, ∠RQS = ∠2.
- Angle at S (Angle(S, Q, P)) is 51 degrees. That means ∠SQP = 51°.
- Angle at P (Angle(P, R, Q)) is 33 degrees. So, ∠PRQ = 33°.
- Angle at S (Angle(Q, S, R)) is equal to angle 1. Wait, no—wait, it says Angle(Q, S, R) is equal to angle 1. Wait, Angle(Q, S, R) would be ∠QSR? Or maybe I need to parse the notation correctly. In angle notation, Angle(A, B, C) refers to the angle at point B between points A and C. So Angle(Q, S, R) is the angle at point S between points Q and R. So that's ∠QSR. Therefore, ∠QSR = ∠1.

Also, there's a point S lying on line RP. So, point S is somewhere along the line connecting R and P. Also, lines QP and QR are perpendicular. Since they're perpendicular, that means ∠PQR is 90 degrees because those two lines meet at Q and form a right angle.

Let me sketch this mentally. There's a quadrilateral or triangle? Wait, since S lies on line RP, perhaps we have triangle QRS and QPR? Maybe multiple triangles here.

Wait, but let's think about the points. Points involved are Q, R, S, P. And S is on line RP. So, points R, S, P are colinear with S between them? Not sure yet. But also, lines QP and QR are perpendicular. So Q is connected to both P and R, forming a right angle at Q. So, triangle PQR has a right angle at Q?

Wait, if QP and QR are perpendicular, then yes, triangle PQR is a right triangle with right angle at Q. However, S is a point on line RP. So maybe S is somewhere along the hypotenuse PR of triangle PQR?

But then there's also angles mentioned involving S. For example, angle at S (∠QSR) equals angle 1. Also, angle at R (∠RQS) equals angle 2. Hmm. Maybe there's another triangle involving S?

Alternatively, maybe there's a quadrilateral PQRS with certain properties. Let me try to reconstruct the diagram step by step.

Starting with point Q. From Q, draw two perpendicular lines: QP and QR. So, Q is the vertex of a right angle, with QP going one way and QR going another. Then, point S lies on line RP. Wait, so R is connected to P, and S is on that line. So, line RP connects points R and P. So, starting from R, through S to P. So, S is somewhere between R and P.

So, points R and P are connected by a line, with S lying on that line. Now, considering that, we can imagine triangle QRS and triangle QSP? Or maybe triangle QRS and triangle QPS?

Given that, let's consider the angles given. We know ∠SQP is 51 degrees. That's the angle at Q between S and P. Wait, ∠SQP is at point Q, between points S and P. Since QP is one of the legs of the right angle at Q, and S is on line RP, which connects R and P. So, line QS is connecting Q to S, which is on RP. So, maybe triangle QSP? Let me think.

Also, ∠PRQ is 33 degrees. Wait, ∠PRQ is the angle at R between points P and Q. So, that's part of triangle PRQ. Since triangle PRQ is a right triangle at Q, with right angle at Q. So, in triangle PQR, angle at Q is 90°, angle at R is given as 33°, so angle at P can be calculated. Let me check that first.

In triangle PQR, angles sum to 180°. So:

∠PQR = 90°, ∠PRQ = 33°, so ∠QPR = 180° - 90° - 33° = 57°. So, angle at P is 57 degrees. Wait, but ∠QPR is angle at P between Q and R. Is that related to anything else?

Now, looking back at other given angles. ∠SQP is 51°, which is angle at Q between S and P. Since QP is a side of triangle PQR, and S is on line RP. So, line QS splits the triangle into two parts. Let me think about triangle QSP. In triangle QSP, we might have angles at Q, S, and P.

But also, there's ∠RQS = ∠2. So, angle at Q between R and S. Which would be adjacent to ∠SQP. Because ∠RQS and ∠SQP together make up the total angle at Q between R and P. Wait, since S is on line RP, then line QS divides the angle at Q into two parts: ∠RQS and ∠SQP. Therefore, ∠RQS + ∠SQP = ∠RQP. But wait, ∠RQP is the angle at Q between R and P. Which in triangle PQR is 90°, right? Wait, earlier we said ∠PQR is 90°, which is the same as ∠RQP. Wait, but ∠RQP is the angle at Q between R and P, which is indeed 90°, as per the perpendicularity of QP and QR.

Therefore, ∠RQS + ∠SQP = 90°. Given that ∠SQP is 51°, then ∠RQS = 90° - 51° = 39°. But according to the problem statement, ∠RQS equals angle 2. Therefore, angle 2 is 39 degrees. Wait, but angle 2 isn't directly needed for finding angle 1, unless it's part of another triangle. But let me note that down.

Now, moving on. We have ∠QSR equals angle 1. So, angle at S between Q and R. So, in triangle QSR, angle at S is ∠QSR = angle 1. To find this angle, we may need more information about triangle QSR. Let me see.

To find ∠QSR, we might need to find other angles in triangle QSR. Let's consider triangle QSR. In triangle QSR, we know ∠RQS is 39°, as established above. If we can find another angle in this triangle, we could use the fact that angles sum to 180°.

But what is the third angle in triangle QSR? It would be ∠QRS. Wait, ∠QRS is the angle at R between Q and S. Wait, but we already have ∠PRQ as 33°, which is the angle at R between P and Q. Now, since S is on line RP, then ∠QRS is part of that angle. Specifically, ∠PRQ is split into ∠QRS and ∠PRS? Wait, depending on where S is located on line RP.

Wait, if S is on line RP, then when you look at point R, the angle between Q and S would be ∠QRS. But ∠PRQ is the angle at R between P and Q. Since S is on line RP, then ∠PRS is zero? No, maybe I need to clarify.

Let me think again. At point R, we have line segments RQ and RS (since S is on line RP). Wait, line RS is part of line RP. So, the angle between RQ and RS is ∠QRS. But originally, the angle between RQ and RP (which is the same as RS direction) is ∠PRQ, which is 33°. Therefore, ∠QRS is equal to ∠PRQ, because RS is along RP. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, if S is on line RP, then line RS is just a segment of line RP. Therefore, the angle between RQ and RS is the same as the angle between RQ and RP, which is ∠PRQ = 33°. Therefore, ∠QRS is 33°.

Wait, but that would mean in triangle QSR, we have angles:

At Q: ∠RQS = 39°,

At R: ∠QRS = 33°,

Therefore, the remaining angle at S (∠QSR) is 180° - 39° - 33° = 108°. Therefore, ∠QSR = 108°, which is angle 1. So, the measure of angle 1 would be 108°, which corresponds to option C.

Wait, but let me verify this again. Because if ∠QRS is 33°, then yes, adding up with ∠RQS = 39° gives 72°, leaving 108° for ∠QSR. But let me confirm whether ∠QRS is indeed 33°.

Because ∠PRQ is the angle at R between P and Q, which is 33°, and since S is on line RP, then the angle between RQ and RS (which is the same as RP) is still 33°, so ∠QRS = 33°. Yes, that makes sense.

Therefore, triangle QSR has angles 39°, 33°, and 108°, making angle 1 equal to 108°, which is option C.

But let me cross-check with another approach. Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines or something else.

Alternatively, considering coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to the points to calculate.

Assume point Q is at (0, 0). Since QP and QR are perpendicular, let me take QP along x-axis and QR along y-axis. Let me set coordinates:

Let’s say Q is at origin (0,0).

Since QP is horizontal and QR is vertical.

Let me assume length for simplicity. Suppose QP is along positive x-axis, QR along positive y-axis.

Let me define coordinates:

Let’s suppose point P is at (a, 0), point R is at (0, b). Then line RP connects R(0,b) to P(a, 0). Point S lies on line RP.

Parametric equation of line RP: Any point S on RP can be expressed as (ta, b - tb) where t ranges from 0 to 1. Wait, parametric equations. Starting at R(0, b) when t=0, moving towards P(a, 0) when t=1. So, general point S can be written as (ta, b(1 - t)) for t ∈ [0,1].

Then, coordinates of S are (ta, b(1 - t)).

Now, we can compute angles based on these coordinates. However, this might get complicated, but maybe we can find relations.

We know that in triangle PQR, angle at R is 33°, which was computed earlier. Let me check that with coordinates.

In triangle PQR, with Q(0,0), R(0, b), P(a, 0). So, triangle with right angle at Q.

The angle at R is ∠PRQ. Let's compute tan(∠PRQ). In triangle PQR, opposite over adjacent for angle at R. The sides adjacent to angle R are RQ and RP.

Wait, angle at R is between sides RQ and RP. So, RQ has length sqrt((0 - 0)^2 + (b - 0)^2) = b. RP is the hypotenuse of triangle PQR, which has length sqrt(a² + b²). The angle at R is ∠PRQ, which we previously determined as 33°, so tan(∠PRQ) = opposite / adjacent. Opposite side to angle R is PQ, which is length a. Adjacent side is RQ, which is length b. Wait, no. Wait, in triangle PQR, angle at R: the sides adjacent to angle R are RQ and the segment from R to P. Wait, maybe I should use trigonometry.

Actually, in triangle PQR, angle at R: tan(∠PRQ) = PQ / RQ. Because PQ is opposite to angle R, and RQ is adjacent. Wait, PQ is the side opposite angle R. Wait, PQ is the side opposite angle R? Let me think. In triangle PQR, angle at R. The sides:

- Opposite angle R: PQ.

- Adjacent to angle R: RQ and PR.

Wait, perhaps better to use coordinates. Coordinates:

Point Q(0,0), R(0, b), P(a, 0).

Vector RQ is from R to Q: (0 - 0, 0 - b) = (0, -b)

Vector RP is from R to P: (a - 0, 0 - b) = (a, -b)

The angle at R between vectors RQ and RP is ∠PRQ. So, using the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (RQ · RP) / (|RQ| |RP|)

Compute RQ · RP = (0)(a) + (-b)(-b) = b².

|RQ| = sqrt(0² + (-b)²) = b.

|RP| = sqrt(a² + b²).

Thus cos(theta) = b² / [b * sqrt(a² + b²)] ) = b / sqrt(a² + b²)

Which implies theta = arccos(b / sqrt(a² + b²)). Which is equal to angle whose tangent is a/b. Wait, because if theta is angle at R, then tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent = PQ / RQ = a / b.

Yes, because in triangle PQR, tan(angle at R) = opposite / adjacent = PQ / RQ = a / b.

Earlier, we had angle at R is 33°, so tan(33°) = a / b => a / b = tan(33°).

Let me compute tan(33°): approximately 0.6494. So, a ≈ 0.6494 * b.

But maybe exact values aren't necessary here. Anyway, moving forward.

Now, we also know that ∠SQP is 51°, which is the angle at Q between points S and P. Since Q is at (0,0), and P is at (a, 0), and S is on line RP. Let me find coordinates of S such that angle SQP is 51°.

Point S is on line RP: parametrize as before, S(t) = (ta, b(1 - t)).

So, coordinates of S are (ta, b(1 - t)).

Then, vector QS is from Q(0,0) to S(ta, b(1 - t)): (ta, b(1 - t)).

Vector QP is from Q(0,0) to P(a, 0): (a, 0).

The angle between vectors QS and QP is ∠SQP = 51°, which we can compute using the dot product.

Dot product of QS and QP is (ta)(a) + [b(1 - t)](0) = ta².

Magnitude of QS is sqrt[(ta)^2 + (b(1 - t))^2]

Magnitude of QP is sqrt(a² + 0^2) = a.

So, cos(51°) = [ta²] / [sqrt(t²a² + b²(1 - t)^2) * a ] = [ta²] / [a * sqrt(t²a² + b²(1 - t)^2)] ) = [ta] / sqrt(t²a² + b²(1 - t)^2 )

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

cos²(51°) = [t²a²] / [t²a² + b²(1 - t)^2 ]

Cross multiplying:

[cos²(51°)] [t²a² + b²(1 - t)^2 ] = t²a²

Expanding:

cos²(51°) * t²a² + cos²(51°)*b²(1 - t)^2 = t²a²

Bring terms with t²a² to left:

cos²(51°) * t²a² - t²a² + cos²(51°)*b²(1 - t)^2 = 0

Factor t²a²:

t²a² [cos²(51°) - 1] + cos²(51°) * b²(1 - t)^2 = 0

Note that cos²(x) - 1 = -sin²(x):

So:

-t²a² sin²(51°) + cos²(51°) * b²(1 - t)^2 = 0

This seems complex. Maybe instead of solving for t, I can relate the ratio a/b from earlier.

From earlier, we had a / b = tan(33°), so let me denote k = a / b = tan(33°). Thus, a = k*b.

Substituting a = k*b into the equation:

-t²(k*b)^2 sin²(51°) + cos²(51°) * b²(1 - t)^2 = 0

Divide both sides by b²:

- t²k² sin²(51°) + cos²(51°)(1 - t)^2 = 0

Expand (1 - t)^2:

- t²k² sin²(51°) + cos²(51°)(1 - 2t + t²) = 0

Grouping terms:

[-k² sin²(51°) + cos²(51°)] t² + [-2 cos²(51°) t] + cos²(51°) = 0

This quadratic equation in t can be solved, but it's getting too algebraic. Perhaps there's a simpler way.

Alternatively, since we already derived earlier that angle 1 is 108°, which is option C, but let me check if that holds with this coordinate system.

Alternatively, let's consider triangle QSR. Earlier conclusion was that ∠QSR = 108°, which would be angle 1. If that's the case, then answer is C.

But to ensure correctness, let me check another approach.

We had in triangle QSR:

∠RQS = 39°, ∠QRS = 33°, so ∠QSR = 180 - 39 - 33 = 108°, hence angle 1 is 108°, which is option C.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake assuming ∠QRS = 33°. Let me re-examine that.

At point R, the original angle ∠PRQ is 33°, which is between points P, R, Q. Since S is on line RP, then the angle between RQ and RS (which is the same direction as RP) is still 33°, so ∠QRS is indeed 33°. Hence, the calculation holds.

Another possible error: Did I mix up angles? For instance, ∠RQS is 39°, which is the angle at Q between R and S. Then, in triangle QSR, angles at Q is 39°, at R is 33°, so angle at S is 180 - 39 - 33 = 108°, which is angle 1. This seems consistent.

Hence, the measure of angle 1 is 108°, so the answer is C.

But let me check the answer choices again: A. 39, B. 84, C. 108, D. 129. So 108 is option C. 

Therefore, the answer should be C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ m\angle 1 $, we begin by analyzing the geometric relationships and constraints provided in the question. Here's a clear breakdown of the reasoning and computation steps:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Diagram**

We are given the following key facts:

- $ \angle RQS = \angle 2 $
- $ \angle SQP = 51^\circ $
- $ \angle PRQ = 33^\circ $
- $ \angle QSR = \angle 1 $
- Lines $ QP $ and $ QR $ are **perpendicular**, meaning $ \angle PQR = 90^\circ $
- Point $ S $ lies on the line segment $ RP $

From this, we deduce that $ \triangle PQR $ is a right triangle at $ Q $, and point $ S $ lies on the hypotenuse $ RP $. Additionally, line $ QS $ intersects the hypotenuse $ RP $ at point $ S $, dividing triangle $ PQR $ into smaller sub-triangles.

---

### **Step 2: Use Known Angles to Find Missing Ones**

#### **Triangle $ PQR $:**
- Right triangle at $ Q $, so:
  $$
  \angle PQR = 90^\circ
  $$
- Given $ \angle PRQ = 33^\circ $, then:
  $$
  \angle QPR = 180^\circ - 90^\circ - 33^\circ = 57^\circ
  $$

#### **Angle $ \angle RQS $:**
- Since $ \angle SQP = 51^\circ $ and $ \angle RQS + \angle SQP = \angle PQR = 90^\circ $,
  $$
  \angle RQS = 90^\circ - 51^\circ = 39^\circ
  $$
- Given that $ \angle RQS = \angle 2 $, so $ \angle 2 = 39^\circ $

---

### **Step 3: Analyze Triangle $ QSR $**

We now focus on triangle $ QSR $, where we are asked to find $ \angle QSR = \angle 1 $.

- We already found:
  - $ \angle RQS = 39^\circ $
  - $ \angle QRS = \angle PRQ = 33^\circ $ (because $ S $ lies on line $ RP $, so $ \angle QRS $ remains unchanged)
  
Using the triangle angle sum property:
$$
\angle QSR = 180^\circ - \angle RQS - \angle QRS = 180^\circ - 39^\circ - 33^\circ = 108^\circ
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

The measure of $ \angle QSR = \angle 1 = 108^\circ $

---

**Final Answer:** $\boxed{C}$
