MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to visualize the figure based on the given constraints. Let me jot down all the information provided:

1. The length of line BD is 22 units.
2. The length of line BC is 40 units.
3. Angle at point C (angle BCA) is denoted as y.
4. Angle at point B (angle DBA) is denoted as x.
5. Point A lies on the line CD.
6. The lengths of lines AD and AC are equal.
7. Lines DA and DB are perpendicular.

Hmm, so first, maybe drawing a diagram would help. But since I can't draw here, I'll try to imagine it. Let me think about each constraint step by step.

Starting with points B, C, D, A. Given that point A lies on line CD. Also, DA and DB are perpendicular. So, point D has two lines: DA and DB, which are perpendicular. That suggests that triangle DAB is a right-angled triangle at D? Wait, no. If DA and DB are perpendicular, then angle between DA and DB is 90 degrees. So, point D is connected to A and B such that DA ⊥ DB. Therefore, triangle DAB is right-angled at D. 

Also, since A is on line CD, so points C, D, A are colinear. So, line CD passes through point A. And also, AD equals AC. So, the length of AD equals AC. Which implies that A is the midpoint of CD? Wait, because if AD = AC, then AC = AD, meaning that starting from point A, moving along CD, the distance from A to D is same as from A to C. Wait, but since A is on CD, then depending on the order of points, maybe?

Wait, if A is on line CD, then the order could be C-A-D or D-A-C or something else. But since AD equals AC, then the distances from A to D and A to C are equal. So, if we consider points C and D, then A is equidistant from both. So, A is the midpoint between C and D? Or perhaps not necessarily, unless the line CD is straight. Since A is on CD, then yes, if AC = AD, then A is the midpoint of CD. Because the distance from A to C and A to D are equal. Therefore, AC = AD implies that A is the midpoint of segment CD. Therefore, CD = AC + AD = 2*AC.

But wait, hold on. Let me confirm. Suppose points are arranged as C---A---D. Then AC would be the distance from A to C, and AD would be from A to D. If they're equal, then yes, A is the midpoint. Alternatively, if the points were ordered differently, like D---A---C, then again AC would be longer than AD. Wait, but if A is between C and D, then AC + AD = CD. If AC = AD, then CD = 2*AC. So regardless of the order, as long as A is between C and D, then AC = AD means A is midpoint. However, if A isn't between them, then... For example, if C is between A and D, then AC would be part of AD. But then AD would be AC + CD. But since AD = AC, that would imply CD = 0, which is impossible. Similarly for other orders. Therefore, A must lie between C and D such that AC = AD, making A the midpoint of CD. Therefore, CD = 2*AC.

Now, considering that DA is perpendicular to DB. So, triangle DAB is right-angled at D. Therefore, in triangle DAB, angle at D is 90 degrees. Also, we have BD = 22, BC = 40. Let me note these values.

So, BD = 22, BC = 40. Also, since A is midpoint of CD, then AC = AD. Let me denote AC = AD = m. Then CD = 2m.

But how does BC come into play? BC connects points B and C. Also, angle at C (angle BCA) is y, and angle at B (angle DBA) is x. We need to find x.

Let me try to sketch coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to points will help. Let me place point D at origin (0,0). Since DA is perpendicular to DB, and assuming DA is along some axis. Let me set coordinate system.

Let me assume point D is at (0, 0). Since DA is perpendicular to DB, suppose DA is along the positive y-axis and DB along the positive x-axis. Wait, but if DA and DB are perpendicular, then vectors DA and DB are perpendicular. So, if D is at (0, 0), then point A could be somewhere along y-axis, say A = (0, a), and point B would be along x-axis, say B = (b, 0). Then DA vector is (0, a) - (0, 0) = (0, a), and DB vector is (b, 0) - (0, 0) = (b, 0). These are perpendicular because their dot product is zero.

Yes, that seems good. So let me assign coordinates accordingly.

Set D at (0, 0).

Let me define point A as (0, a), since DA is vertical. Then DA length is |DA| = sqrt((0 - 0)^2 + (a - 0)^2) = |a|. Since length is positive, let me take a > 0, so DA = a.

Since A lies on line CD, and CD is a line passing through points C and D. Since D is at (0, 0) and A is at (0, a), then line CD is the vertical line x=0. Wait, because points C and D are on line CD, and A is on CD. Since D is at (0, 0) and A is at (0, a), then line CD is the line x=0 (the y-axis). Therefore, point C is another point on line CD. Since A is the midpoint of CD, then since A is between C and D, then coordinates of C would be symmetric with respect to A. Since A is at (0, a), and D is at (0, 0), then C must be at (0, 2a). Wait, because if A is the midpoint between C and D, then coordinates of A = [(x_C + x_D)/2, (y_C + y_D)/2]. Since D is (0, 0), and A is (0, a), then:

For x-coordinate: (x_C + 0)/2 = 0 => x_C = 0.

For y-coordinate: (y_C + 0)/2 = a => y_C = 2a.

Therefore, point C is at (0, 2a). Therefore, coordinates:

D: (0, 0)

A: (0, a)

C: (0, 2a)

Now, point B is somewhere such that DB is horizontal (since earlier assumption was that DB is along x-axis). Wait, earlier, I said that DA is vertical (along y-axis) and DB is horizontal (along x-axis). Therefore, point B is at (b, 0), for some b ≠ 0.

Given that BD length is 22. BD is from B(b, 0) to D(0, 0). So length BD is sqrt[(b - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2] = |b|. Therefore, |b| = 22. Let me assume b is positive, so b = 22. Hence, point B is at (22, 0).

Now, coordinates:

B: (22, 0)

D: (0, 0)

A: (0, a)

C: (0, 2a)

Now, need to find relations involving BC length, which is given as 40.

Compute length BC. Coordinates of B(22, 0) and C(0, 2a). So distance BC is sqrt[(22 - 0)^2 + (0 - 2a)^2] = sqrt[484 + 4a²] = 40.

Thus,

sqrt(484 + 4a²) = 40

Square both sides:

484 + 4a² = 1600

Subtract 484:

4a² = 1600 - 484 = 1116

Divide by 4:

a² = 279

Therefore, a = sqrt(279). Let me compute sqrt(279):

Well, 16^2 = 256, 17^2 = 289, so sqrt(279) ≈ 16.7...

But exact value might not matter yet. Let me keep it as sqrt(279) for now.

So, point A is at (0, sqrt(279)).

Now, need to find angle x, which is measure of angle at B, i.e., angle DBA. So, angle between BA and BD.

Wait, angle at B: angle DBC? Wait, the notation MeasureOf(Angle(D, B, A)) is angle at B between points D, B, A. So vertex at B, with segments BD and BA. So angle between BD and BA at point B.

So, angle x is ∠DBA.

To find this angle, we can use coordinates. Let's compute vectors BD and BA, then compute the angle between them.

First, coordinates:

Point B: (22, 0)

Point D: (0, 0)

Point A: (0, sqrt(279))

Vector BD is from B to D: D - B = (0 - 22, 0 - 0) = (-22, 0)

Vector BA is from B to A: A - B = (0 - 22, sqrt(279) - 0) = (-22, sqrt(279))

Then, the angle between vectors BD and BA is angle x.

The formula for angle θ between vectors u and v is:

cosθ = (u · v) / (|u| |v| )

Compute the dot product:

u · v = (-22)(-22) + (0)(sqrt(279)) = 484 + 0 = 484

|u| is |BD| = 22 (given)

|v| is |BA| = sqrt( (-22)^2 + (sqrt(279))^2 ) = sqrt(484 + 279) = sqrt(763)

Therefore,

cosθ = 484 / (22 * sqrt(763)) )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 484 = 22 * 22

Denominator: 22 * sqrt(763)

Cancel out 22:

cosθ = 22 / sqrt(763)

Compute this value numerically.

First, calculate sqrt(763):

Let me approximate sqrt(763). Well, 27^2 = 729, 28^2=784. So sqrt(763) ≈ 27.62 (exact value?)

Compute 27.6^2 = 27^2 + 2*27*0.6 + 0.6^2 = 729 + 32.4 + 0.36 = 761.76. Close to 763. Difference is 763 - 761.76 = 1.24. Next, 27.6 + delta squared is 763.

Approximate delta:

(27.6 + d)^2 ≈ 761.76 + 2*27.6*d = 763

So 55.2d ≈ 1.24 → d ≈ 1.24 / 55.2 ≈ 0.0225. So approx 27.6 + 0.0225 ≈ 27.6225. Thus sqrt(763) ≈ 27.6225.

Therefore, cosθ ≈ 22 / 27.6225 ≈ ?

Calculate 22 divided by 27.6225:

Well, 27.6225 × 0.8 = 22.098. So approximately 0.8 times.

Because 27.6225 × 0.8 = 22.098, which is slightly more than 22. Therefore, cosθ ≈ 0.8 - a little bit.

Let me compute 22 / 27.6225:

≈ 22 / 27.6225 ≈ 0.7966 (approx). Let me check with calculator steps:

If 27.6225 × 0.7966 ≈ 27.6225 × 0.8 = 22.098 minus 27.6225 × 0.0034 ≈ 22.098 - 0.0939 ≈ 22.004. Close enough. So cosθ ≈ 0.7966.

Then θ ≈ arccos(0.7966). What's arccos(0.7966)?

I know that cos(37°) ≈ 0.7986, which is close. Let me check:

cos(37°): Using calculator, cos(37°) ≈ 0.7986. Our value is 0.7966, which is slightly less. So angle is slightly larger than 37 degrees.

Difference: 0.7986 vs 0.7966. The difference is about -0.002. How much angle change corresponds to that?

The derivative of cosθ at θ=37° is -sinθ. At θ=37°, sin(37°) ≈ 0.6. So, Δθ ≈ Δ(cosθ)/(-sinθ) = (-0.002)/(-0.6) ≈ 0.0033 radians. Convert radians to degrees: 0.0033 * (180/π) ≈ 0.0033 * 57.3 ≈ 0.19 degrees. So angle is approximately 37° + 0.19° ≈ 37.19°, which rounds to 37.2 degrees. Looking at the answer choices, option A is 37.2. So that would suggest answer A. But let me verify my steps again to make sure there's no error.

Wait, but let me check if I made any mistake in calculation.

Earlier steps:

Computed BC length as sqrt( (22)^2 + (2a)^2 ) = sqrt(484 + 4a²) = 40. So 484 + 4a² = 1600 ⇒ 4a² = 1116 ⇒ a² = 279. Correct.

Coordinates of point A: (0, a), so BA vector is from B(22,0) to A(0,a): (-22, a). So magnitude of BA is sqrt( (-22)^2 + a^2 ) = sqrt(484 + a²). Wait, earlier I thought it was sqrt(484 + 279) = sqrt(763). Wait, because a² is 279. Yes. So sqrt(484 + 279) = sqrt(763). Correct.

Dot product between BD vector (-22, 0) and BA vector (-22, a) is (-22)(-22) + (0)(a) = 484 + 0 = 484. Correct.

So cos(theta) = 484/( |BD| * |BA| ) = 484/(22 * sqrt(763)) = 22/sqrt(763). Correct.

Which simplifies to 22/sqrt(763). Let me compute sqrt(763) precisely. As above, approx 27.6225. So 22 / 27.6225 ≈ 0.7966. Then arccos(0.7966) ≈ 37.2 degrees. So answer A is 37.2. But let me check with more accurate calculation.

Alternatively, maybe using exact computation. Let me calculate 22 / sqrt(763):

First compute sqrt(763):

As before, sqrt(763) ≈ 27.6225. Let me get more precise value.

Let me compute 27.62^2 = ?

27^2 = 729.

0.62^2 = 0.3844

Cross term: 2 * 27 * 0.62 = 33.48

Total: 729 + 33.48 + 0.3844 = 762.8644. Which is very close to 763. So 27.62^2 = 762.8644. The difference between 763 and 762.8644 is 0.1356. To find better approximation:

Let’s denote x = 27.62 + δ, such that x² = 763.

We have (27.62 + δ)^2 = 762.8644 + 2*27.62*δ + δ² = 763.

Assuming δ is small, δ² is negligible. So:

2*27.62*δ ≈ 763 - 762.8644 = 0.1356

=> δ ≈ 0.1356 / (55.24) ≈ 0.002455.

So sqrt(763) ≈ 27.62 + 0.002455 ≈ 27.622455.

Thus, sqrt(763) ≈ 27.6225.

Therefore, 22 / 27.6225 ≈ Let me perform division:

22 ÷ 27.6225.

Let me write this as 22 / 27.6225 = ?

Multiply numerator and denominator by 10000 to remove decimals:

220000 / 276225 ≈ Let me divide numerator and denominator by 25:

Numerator: 220000 / 25 = 8800

Denominator: 276225 /25 = 11049

So ≈ 8800 / 11049 ≈ Let me compute decimal value.

Dividing 8800 by 11049.

Well, 11049 × 0.8 = 8839.2, which is larger than 8800. So 0.8 - (difference)/(denominator).

Difference: 8839.2 - 8800 = 39.2.

So 0.8 - (39.2 / 11049) ≈ 0.8 - 0.00354 ≈ 0.79646.

So cos(theta) ≈ 0.79646.

Now, let's compute arccos(0.79646). Let me recall that:

cos(37°) ≈ 0.7986

cos(37.5°): Let me compute cos(37.5°). 37.5° is 37°30', which is halfway between 37° and 38°.

Using calculator-like approach:

Alternatively, use Taylor series or known values. Alternatively, use linear approximation between 37° and 38°.

At 37°, cos(37°) ≈ 0.7986

At 38°, cos(38°) ≈ 0.7880

So difference between 37° and 38° is 1°, corresponding to decrease in cosine of 0.7986 - 0.7880 = 0.0106 over 1 degree.

Our value is 0.79646, which is 0.7986 - 0.79646 = 0.00214 below 0.7986. So fraction of the interval: 0.00214 / 0.0106 ≈ 0.202. So angle is 37° + 0.202*(1°) ≈ 37.202°, which is approximately 37.2°, matching our initial estimate. Therefore, angle x ≈ 37.2°, which is option A.

But let me cross-check once more if there is any possible mistake in assumptions.

Wait, in the beginning, I assumed that DA is vertical and DB is horizontal, placing D at (0,0), A at (0,a), B at (b,0). But is there another possibility? For instance, could DA and DB be in different orientations? But since they are perpendicular, any orientation is acceptable as long as they are perpendicular. However, choosing coordinates this way simplified the problem, and since angles are preserved under rotation, this should be okay.

Another thing to check: Did I correctly model the position of point C?

Yes, since A is midpoint of CD, with D at (0,0) and A at (0,a), then C is at (0, 2a). Then BC is computed as distance between (22,0) and (0, 2a), leading to equation sqrt(22² + (2a)^2) = 40, which gives a² = 279. All steps seem correct.

Another check: Could there be another configuration where A is not between C and D? Earlier reasoning suggested that if AC = AD, then A must be between C and D. But let me think again. Suppose point C is on one side of A, and D is on the other side, but then AC = AD implies that A is equidistant from C and D, but not necessarily between them. Wait, but if A is not between C and D, then CD would be longer than AC + AD. But since AC = AD, then CD = AC + AD only if A is between C and D. Otherwise, if A is outside, then CD would be |AC - AD|. But since AC = AD, then CD would be zero. Which is impossible. Therefore, A must lie between C and D. Therefore, our previous assumption holds.

Hence, calculations are correct, leading to angle x ≈ 37.2°, which matches option A.

But just to ensure, let me check with actual calculation using calculator-like computations.

Suppose I use a calculator to compute arccos(22 / sqrt(763)).

First compute sqrt(763) ≈ 27.6225.

Then 22 / 27.6225 ≈ 0.79646.

Now, arccos(0.79646):

Using a calculator (pretending I have one here), let's see. Let me remember that cos(37°) ≈ 0.7986, as mentioned. Let me check cos(37.2°):

Convert 37.2° to radians: 37.2 * π / 180 ≈ 0.649 radians.

cos(0.649) ≈ ?

Using Taylor series around 0.649 radians. Alternatively, use iterative method.

Alternatively, use the fact that cos(37.2°) ≈ ?

Alternatively, use calculator input:

Let me think of another approach. Let me use the inverse cosine function.

Let me use the value of 0.79646. Let me check what angle gives this cosine.

Let me use the approximation formula. Let me take θ = 37° + δ, where δ is small.

cos(θ) = cos(37° + δ) ≈ cos(37°)cos(δ) - sin(37°)sin(δ)

Assuming δ is in radians. Let me convert 37° to radians: 37° = 0.64577 radians.

But perhaps easier to work in degrees for small δ.

Alternatively, use the linear approximation:

Let f(θ) = cosθ. We know f(37°) = 0.7986, and we want f(θ) = 0.79646.

df/dθ = -sinθ. At θ = 37°, df/dθ ≈ -sin(37°) ≈ -0.6.

So, Δf ≈ -0.6 * Δθ (in radians). Here, Δf = 0.79646 - 0.7986 = -0.00214.

So, -0.00214 ≈ -0.6 * Δθ_radians → Δθ_radians ≈ 0.00214 / 0.6 ≈ 0.00357 radians.

Convert radians to degrees: 0.00357 * (180/π) ≈ 0.00357 * 57.3 ≈ 0.204 degrees.

Thus, θ ≈ 37° + 0.204° ≈ 37.204°, which rounds to 37.2°, confirming our prior conclusion. Therefore, the correct answer is A.

But let me check if there is any alternative interpretation of the problem that may lead to a different answer. For example, maybe angle y is involved in some way? Wait, the problem says to find x, which is angle at B, but angle y is angle at C (angle BCA). Perhaps there are relationships between angles x and y?

But according to the problem statement, we aren't asked about y; we are to find x. So even if there are relations between x and y, since we already derived x directly via coordinates, perhaps that's sufficient.

Alternatively, maybe I can check using triangle ABC or other triangles.

Let me consider triangle ABC. Points A(0,a), B(22,0), C(0, 2a). Compute angles.

But maybe not necessary, since we already found x via vectors. However, just to check consistency.

In triangle ABC, we can compute sides:

AB: distance from A(0,a) to B(22,0): sqrt(22² + a²) = sqrt(484 + 279) = sqrt(763), as before.

BC: 40, as given.

AC: distance from A(0,a) to C(0, 2a): |2a - a| = a. So AC = a.

From earlier, a² = 279 ⇒ a = sqrt(279) ≈ 16.7.

So in triangle ABC, sides:

AB = sqrt(763) ≈ 27.62

BC = 40

AC = sqrt(279) ≈ 16.7

Check if Law of Sines holds for angle at C (which is y).

Law of Sines: In triangle ABC,

sin(y)/AB = sin(angle at A)/BC = sin(angle at B)/AC

But angle at B in triangle ABC is angle ABC, which is different from angle x. Wait, angle x is angle DBA, which is not the same as angle ABC. So maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps using coordinates to find angle y, but since we don't need it, maybe not needed.

Thus, all steps seem consistent. Therefore, confident that answer is A. 37.2.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x = \text{MeasureOf}(Angle(D, B, A)) $, we begin by interpreting the geometric setup described in the problem. Key elements include:

- $ \text{LengthOf}(Line(B, D)) = 22 $
- $ \text{LengthOf}(Line(B, C)) = 40 $
- $ \text{LengthOf}(Line(A, D)) = \text{LengthOf}(Line(A, C)) $
- $ \text{Perpendicular}(Line(D, A), Line(D, B)) $
- $ \text{PointLiesOnLine}(A, Line(C, D)) $

---

### Step 1: Coordinate Setup

To simplify the geometry, we place the points in a coordinate plane with the following assumptions:

- Let point **D** be at the origin: $ D = (0, 0) $
- Since $ DA \perp DB $, we align:
  - **DA** along the **y-axis**, so **A** lies on the **y-axis**
  - **DB** along the **x-axis**, so **B** lies on the **x-axis**

This ensures that vectors $ \vec{DA} $ and $ \vec{DB} $ are perpendicular.

Let:
- $ A = (0, a) $, so $ DA = a $
- $ B = (b, 0) $, so $ DB = |b| = 22 $, hence $ b = 22 $
  
Now, since $ A $ lies on line $ CD $, and $ AC = AD $, this implies that **A** is the **midpoint** of segment $ CD $. Thus, point **C** lies on the **same vertical line** as **A** and **D**, so its x-coordinate is also 0. Therefore:

- $ C = (0, 2a) $

Now, compute $ BC $:

$$
\text{Distance}(B, C) = \sqrt{(22 - 0)^2 + (0 - 2a)^2} = \sqrt{484 + 4a^2}
$$

Given that $ BC = 40 $, we solve:

$$
\sqrt{484 + 4a^2} = 40 \\
\Rightarrow 484 + 4a^2 = 1600 \\
\Rightarrow 4a^2 = 1116 \\
\Rightarrow a^2 = 279 \\
\Rightarrow a = \sqrt{279}
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine the Angle $ x = \angle DBA $

We now compute the angle at point $ B $, formed by vectors $ \vec{BD} $ and $ \vec{BA} $.

Vectors:
- $ \vec{BD} = D - B = (0 - 22, 0 - 0) = (-22, 0) $
- $ \vec{BA} = A - B = (0 - 22, a - 0) = (-22, a) $

Use the **dot product formula** to find the angle $ x $ between these vectors:

$$
\cos(x) = \frac{\vec{BD} \cdot \vec{BA}}{|\vec{BD}| |\vec{BA}|}
$$

Compute the dot product:

$$
\vec{BD} \cdot \vec{BA} = (-22)(-22) + (0)(a) = 484
$$

Magnitudes:

$$
|\vec{BD}| = 22,\quad |\vec{BA}| = \sqrt{(-22)^2 + a^2} = \sqrt{484 + 279} = \sqrt{763}
$$

So:

$$
\cos(x) = \frac{484}{22 \cdot \sqrt{763}} = \frac{22}{\sqrt{763}}
$$

Now evaluate:

$$
\cos(x) \approx \frac{22}{27.6225} \approx 0.7965
$$

Take the arccosine:

$$
x = \arccos(0.7965) \approx 37.2^\circ
$$

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{\text{A}}
$$
