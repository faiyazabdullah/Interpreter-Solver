MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the given information and figure out how the different elements relate to each other. 

The question involves triangle PQR with several points mentioned: Z, A, Y, X. There are also some length expressions and angles given. The main goal is to find the measure of angle PRZ, which is denoted as m∠PRZ. Also, it's stated that RZ is an angle bisector. Let me start by jotting down all the given data:

First, the points lying on lines:

- Point L lies on line QR (but maybe that's irrelevant since there's no mention of point L elsewhere)
Wait, actually looking back, the first constraint says "PointLiesOnLine(X, Line(Q, R))", but perhaps that's a typo? Maybe it should be Point Lies On Line? Wait, maybe the original problem has some typos. But assuming that the points mentioned are correctly named. However, the key points here are Z, A, Y, X related to lines QR, QY, etc. Let me focus on the important parts.

But perhaps the diagram isn't given, so I have to reconstruct based on the constraints. Let me list all the given constraints again:

Given:

1. Point L lies on line QR. Hmm, but maybe that's a red herring. Then:

2. Point A lies on line QR? Wait, no. Let me recheck:

Original problem states:

- PointLiesOnLine(X, Line(Q, R)): So point X is on line QR?

Wait, the exact wording is confusing because of the way it's written. But let me parse each line:

PointLiesOnLine(X, Line(Q, R)): So X lies on line QR.

PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(Q, Y)): A lies on line QY.

PointLiesOnLine(Z, Line(Q, P)): Z lies on line QP.

PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(R, Z)): A lies on line RZ.

PointLiesOnLine(Y, Line(R, P)): Y lies on line RP.

PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(Y, X)): A lies on line YX.

So, putting these together:

Let me try to visualize triangle PQR. Points Q, R, P forming triangle PQR.

Now, various points:

- Z is on line QP (since Z lies on line QP). So Z is somewhere along QP.

- A is on both line QY and line RZ. Since A lies on QY and on RZ.

- Y is on line RP (from PointLiesOnLine(Y, Line(R, P))). So Y is on RP.

- X is on line QR (from PointLiesOnLine(X, Line(Q, R))).

Also, A is on line YX (so A is the intersection point of YX and ...? Well, since A is already on QY and RZ, then YX passes through A.)

This seems complex. Maybe drawing a rough sketch would help, but since I can't draw, I'll try to imagine.

Let me note that RZ is an angle bisector. That's crucial for solving the problem. So angle PRZ is being asked, and RZ is an angle bisector. Therefore, angle PRZ is half of angle PRQ? Or wait, angle at R between PR and RZ? Wait, angle PRZ is at point R? Wait, no. The notation ∠PRZ means the angle at point R between points P, R, Z. So vertex at R, with segments RP and RZ. Therefore, since RZ is an angle bisector, it splits angle PRQ into two equal parts. Wait, angle PRQ is the angle at R between PR and RQ. If RZ is the bisector, then it splits that angle into two equal angles. But wait, does RZ lie inside the triangle? Let me think.

Since Z is on line QP. So QP is a side of the triangle? Wait, triangle PQR has sides PQ, QR, and PR. So QP is the same as PQ. So Z is on line QP. Depending on where Z is, it could be between Q and P or extended beyond them. Similarly, since Z is on line QP, and RZ is an angle bisector of angle PRQ. Therefore, by the Angle Bisector Theorem, the ratio of the adjacent sides is equal to the ratio of the divided opposite segments.

Wait, the Angle Bisector Theorem states that if a bisector of an angle of a triangle divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. In this case, if RZ is the bisector of angle PRQ, then it should divide the opposite side... Wait, angle at R, so the bisector would meet the opposite side PQ at point Z. Wait, yes! Because in triangle PRQ, angle at R, and the angle bisector RZ meets PQ at Z. Therefore, according to the Angle Bisector Theorem:

PZ / ZQ = PR / RQ.

Wait, but let me confirm. In triangle PRQ, angle bisector at R meets PQ at Z. Therefore, PZ/ZQ = PR/RQ. Wait, but the theorem says that the angle bisector divides the opposite side into the ratio of the adjacent sides. So yes, PZ/ZQ = PR/RQ.

But in our problem, we are given lengths involving ZQ and ZP. Let me check:

Given:

ZQ = 3a - 11,

ZP = a + 5.

Wait, but hold on. If Z is on line QP, then depending on whether Z is between Q and P or outside, the segments might be directed segments. But usually, unless specified otherwise, lengths are positive. So assuming that Z is between Q and P, making QZ and ZP parts of PQ. Therefore, PQ = QZ + ZP. Alternatively, if Z is beyond Q or beyond P, then PQ might be negative. But since lengths are given as algebraic expressions, maybe they're just signed lengths? Not sure. But maybe we can proceed with variables.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses directed segments. However, given that we have equations with variables, maybe we can set up equations using the Angle Bisector Theorem.

So according to the Angle Bisector Theorem, PZ / ZQ = PR / RQ.

But we don't know PR or RQ yet. However, perhaps other given information can help us find relations between variables. Also, there are other given lengths and angles.

Additionally, there are expressions for angles:

m∠PRZ = 4b - 17,

m∠ZRQ = 3b - 4,

and m∠QYR = 7b + 6,

and m∠PX R = 2a + 10.

We need to find m∠PRZ, which is 4b -17, so once we find b, we can compute it.

So, the plan is to find the value of b using the given angle relationships and the Angle Bisector Theorem with the given lengths.

But first, let me handle the angle bisector part. Since RZ is the angle bisector of angle PRQ, then the measure of angle PRZ equals the measure of angle ZRQ. Wait, no. Wait, angle PRZ is one part, and angle ZRQ is the other part. Wait, but if RZ is the bisector, then those two angles should be equal. Wait, angle PRQ is split into two equal angles by RZ. Therefore, angle PRZ = angle ZRQ.

But according to the given measures:

m∠PRZ = 4b - 17,

m∠ZRQ = 3b - 4.

Therefore, setting them equal:

4b -17 = 3b -4 → 4b -3b = -4 +17 → b = 13.

Wait, that seems straightforward. But then substituting b=13 into m∠PRZ gives 4*13 -17 = 52 -17 = 35 degrees. Which is option D. However, before accepting that, I need to make sure that angle PRZ and angle ZRQ are indeed equal. Is RZ really the bisector of angle PRQ?

Yes, the problem says RZ is an angle bisector. Therefore, angle PRZ and angle ZRQ are equal. Hence, equating their measures gives us b=13. Thus, m∠PRZ=35°, which would be option D. However, I need to check if there are other conditions that affect this conclusion. For example, maybe there's more than one angle relationship that needs to be considered, or maybe my assumption about which angles are being bisected is incorrect.

Wait, let me double-check. If RZ is the angle bisector of angle PRQ, then angle PRZ and angle ZRQ are the two angles formed by the bisector. Therefore, they should be equal. So yes, equate them. Therefore, solving 4b -17 = 3b -4 leads to b=13. Therefore, angle PRZ is 4(13)-17= 52-17=35. So answer D. But why are there other given information about other angles and lengths? Like PY, YR, and angles like QYR and PX R? Are they relevant?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Perhaps RZ is not the bisector of angle PRQ, but another angle? Wait, the problem says "RZ is an angle bisector". It doesn't specify which angle. So maybe I need to verify which angle is being bisected. Let me read again:

"If RZ is an angle bisector..."

In triangle PQR, which angle is being bisected by RZ? Since Z is on PQ, then RZ is the bisector of angle at R, which is angle PRQ. Yes, because RZ connects R to Z on PQ. Therefore, it's the bisector of angle PRQ. Therefore, angle PRZ and angle ZRQ are equal. Therefore, my previous reasoning holds. 

However, the presence of other angles and lengths may imply that there are additional constraints. For example, maybe there's something else that relates to the angles given. Let me check the other angles.

Another given angle is m∠QYR = 7b +6. And m∠PX R = 2a +10. Also, there are lengths involving PY and YR: P Y = 2c -1, Y R = 4c -11. 

But maybe these are red herrings? Or maybe they are needed to find values of a or c, which could be connected to the angle measures via some relations. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, maybe the fact that A lies on multiple lines implies certain similar triangles or other relations. Let me consider the points:

From the constraints:

- A lies on QY and RZ. So A is the intersection of QY and RZ.

- Also, A lies on YX. So YX intersects RZ at A.

Similarly, X lies on QR. So X is a point on QR such that YX passes through A.

But without knowing specific positions, it's hard to see. However, maybe we can use Menelaus' theorem or something similar. But perhaps this is overcomplicating. Let me check if there are other relations.

But maybe the problem requires considering other angle relations. For instance, the angles around point Y or point X. However, since the problem only asks for angle PRZ, which we've already found using the angle bisector condition, perhaps the rest of the information is either extra or used to find other variables (like a or c), which might not directly impact angle PRZ. However, maybe there's an inconsistency here. Let me think.

Wait, if RZ is the angle bisector, and we found b=13 leading to angle PRZ=35°, but maybe the other angle measures are supposed to satisfy some relations. For example, maybe the sum of angles in a triangle or supplementary angles?

For example, angle QYR is given as 7b+6. Let me check if that relates to other angles. Suppose Y is on RP. From earlier, Y lies on line RP. Therefore, Y is a point on RP. Then angle QYR is the angle at Y between QY and YR. Let me imagine triangle QYR. Wait, but Y is on RP. So QY connects Q to Y on RP. Then angle QYR is at Y between QY and YR. 

Similarly, angle PX R is given as 2a +10. X is on QR, so PX connects P to X on QR. Then angle PX R is at X between PX and XR. 

But perhaps these angles are related to other parts of the diagram. However, without knowing more about the configuration, it's challenging. However, since the problem includes these other variables (a, c, b) in the lengths and angles, maybe there are more equations to solve. But if the angle PRZ can be determined solely from the angle bisector condition, then maybe those other variables are extraneous? Unless there's a contradiction.

Wait, but let me check if the value of b=13 is possible. For example, angles can't be negative. Let me check if with b=13, all angles are valid.

Compute m∠PRZ = 4b -17 = 4*13 -17 = 52 -17 = 35°, which is fine.

m∠ZRQ = 3b -4 = 39 -4 = 35°, same as above. So that checks out.

What about m∠QYR = 7b +6 = 7*13 +6 = 91 +6= 97°, which is okay.

And m∠PX R = 2a +10. But we don't know a yet. However, perhaps there are other relations involving a. For example, from the lengths given: ZQ = 3a -11 and ZP = a +5. Also, since Z lies on QP, then PQ = QZ + ZP if Z is between Q and P. So PQ = (3a -11) + (a +5) = 4a -6. Alternatively, if Z is not between Q and P, then PQ could be |QZ - ZP|, but since lengths are given as expressions, maybe we need more info.

But perhaps the Angle Bisector Theorem can be applied here. Earlier, I thought that PZ / ZQ = PR / RQ. Let me write that equation.

From Angle Bisector Theorem:

PZ / ZQ = PR / RQ.

But we have expressions for PZ and ZQ in terms of a. However, PR and RQ are unknowns. However, maybe other given information can help us find PR and RQ?

Wait, there are other given lengths involving Y and P. Specifically, P Y = 2c -1 and Y R = 4c -11. Since Y lies on line RP, then PY + YR = PR. Assuming that Y is between P and R. So PR = PY + YR = (2c -1) + (4c -11) = 6c -12. 

So PR = 6c -12. Also, RQ is another side. How do we find RQ? 

Alternatively, maybe we can find RQ via other relations. But I'm not sure yet. However, if we can express PR and RQ in terms of c, but we need another relation to connect c with other variables. However, we also have other constraints involving a and c. 

But perhaps the key is that there's another angle relation. For example, maybe triangle QYR or something else. Let me think.

Angle QYR is given as 7b +6. Since Y is on RP, and QY is connected to Y. So in triangle QYR, angle at Y is 7b +6. Also, maybe we can apply the Law of Sines or something else here. But without knowing any sides, it's difficult. Alternatively, maybe there are similar triangles?

Alternatively, since A lies on QY and RZ, and also on YX. Maybe we can find relations involving a. 

But perhaps there's another angle relation. For example, angle PX R = 2a +10. Since X is on QR, and PX connects to X. Maybe triangle PX R has some properties. But again, without more info, it's tricky.

But perhaps we can assume that the system is consistent and that the value of b=13 is correct, even though there are other variables involved. However, maybe the other information is necessary to ensure consistency. For example, maybe there's a relation between a and c that allows solving for them, and thus confirming that the value of b=13 is valid. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to ignore the other information, focusing only on the angle bisector condition. But that seems odd. Usually, problems include all necessary information. So maybe I missed something.

Wait, going back, the problem mentions several points on lines. For example, A lies on QY and RZ. Also, A lies on YX. So YX intersects RZ at A. Maybe there's some concurrency or something. However, without more specifics, it's unclear. 

Alternatively, since A is on QY and RZ, and also on YX, which connects Y to X on QR. This suggests that A is the intersection point of YX and RZ. Maybe using Ceva's theorem? Or Menelaus?

But again, without more info on the ratios, it's complicated. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a relation between the angles given. For example, angle QYR is 7b +6, which might be related to other angles in the diagram. For instance, if we consider triangle QYR, then the sum of its angles is 180°. Let me explore this.

Assume Y is on RP. So in triangle QYR, we have:

At vertex Y: angle QYR = 7b +6°.

At vertex Q: angle YQR.

At vertex R: angle QRY.

Sum of angles: angle QYR + angle YQR + angle QRY = 180°.

But we need expressions for angles YQR and QRY. 

Angle QRY is part of angle PRQ. Wait, angle QRY is the same as angle QRP? No, angle QRY is at R between Q and Y. But Y is on RP. So angle QRY is the same as angle QRP. Wait, since Y is on RP, then angle QRY is the same as angle QRP. But angle QRP is part of the larger triangle. However, since RZ is the angle bisector of angle PRQ, which is angle at R between PR and RQ. Wait, angle PRQ is the angle at R between PR and RQ. But angle QRY is the angle at R between QR and RY. Since Y is on RP, RY is along RP. Therefore, angle QRY is the same as angle QRP, which is part of angle PRQ. Wait, but if RZ is the bisector of angle PRQ, then angle PRZ = angle ZRQ = 35°, as per earlier. However, angle QRY is angle PRQ, which is split into angle PRZ and ZRQ. Wait, if angle PRZ and ZRQ are each 35°, then angle PRQ is 70°, so angle QRY would be 70°, assuming that Y is positioned such that RY aligns with the bisector? No, because Y is on RP, so RY is along RP. Therefore, angle QRY is the angle at R between QR and RY, which is the same as angle QRP. But angle QRP is the same as angle PRQ. Wait, angle PRQ is the angle at R between PR and RQ. If Y is on RP, then angle QRY is the angle at R between QR and RY, which is the same as angle PRQ, since RY is along RP. Wait, no. Wait, if you have point Y on RP, then RY is a segment from R to Y on RP. So angle QRY is the angle at R between QR and RY. But since Y is on RP, RY is colinear with RP. So angle QRY is the same as angle QRP. Therefore, angle QRY = angle QRP = angle PRQ. Wait, but earlier we said angle PRQ is 70°, so angle QRY is 70°. Therefore, in triangle QYR, angle at R is 70°, angle at Y is 7b +6°, and angle at Q is ?

So angle at Q in triangle QYR is angle YQR. Let's denote that as x. Then:

x + (7b +6) + 70 = 180 => x = 180 -70 -7b -6 = 104 -7b.

But angle YQR is also part of angle PQR of triangle PQR. But I don't know if that helps yet. 

But maybe there's another relation. Since A lies on QY and RZ, and also on YX. Let me think about triangle QYZ or something. 

Alternatively, since A lies on YX, which connects Y to X on QR. So line YX passes through A, which is also on RZ. Therefore, RZ and YX intersect at A. Maybe using Menelaus or Ceva?

But without more information on the ratios, it's still vague. However, perhaps there's another angle relation. For example, angle PX R = 2a +10. Since X is on QR, and PX connects to X. So angle PX R is at X between PX and XR. Let me consider triangle PX R. At point X, angle PX R = 2a +10. What else is known about this triangle?

If we can relate this angle to other parts, maybe using the Law of Sines or something. But again, without side lengths, it's difficult. 

Alternatively, since ZQ = 3a -11 and ZP = a +5, and if we can find PQ, which is QZ + ZP if Z is between Q and P. So PQ = (3a -11) + (a +5) = 4a -6. 

Earlier, from the Angle Bisector Theorem, we had PZ / ZQ = PR / RQ. 

PZ is ZP = a +5, ZQ is 3a -11. So:

(a +5)/(3a -11) = PR / RQ.

But PR = 6c -12 as derived earlier from PY + YR = (2c -1) + (4c -11) = 6c -12.

But RQ is another side. How to find RQ? Well, RQ is the side of the triangle PQR from R to Q. But we don't have direct info. However, maybe we can find RQ using other relations. For example, if we can find another expression for RQ.

Alternatively, if we can find a relation between a and c. For example, if there are other constraints involving a and c.

But right now, we have:

PR = 6c -12,

RQ is unknown,

and from the Angle Bisector Theorem:

(a +5)/(3a -11) = PR / RQ.

But without another equation relating PR and RQ, we cannot solve for a and c. However, maybe there's another relation from the angles?

Looking back, we had in triangle QYR, angle at Y is 7b +6, angle at R is 70°, angle at Q is 104 -7b. 

Is there a way to relate this angle at Q to other parts? For instance, if we can express angle YQR in terms of other angles. 

Angle YQR is part of angle PQR of triangle PQR. Let me denote angle PQR as θ. Then, angle YQR is part of θ. But without knowing where Y is located on PR, it's unclear. However, since Y is on PR, angle YQR is the same as angle PQR. Wait, no. If Y is on PR, then angle YQR is the angle at Q between YQ and QR. Whereas angle PQR is the angle at Q between PQ and QR. So unless Y is at P or R, angle YQR is different from angle PQR. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a relation between angle YQR and other angles. For example, if line QY creates some proportionality. 

But this seems too vague. Maybe I need to consider other given angles. For example, angle PX R = 2a +10. Let me think about that. 

Point X is on QR, so line PX connects P to X on QR. Angle PX R is at X between PX and XR. So in triangle PX R, we have angle at X is 2a +10°, and we might relate it to other angles. 

But again, without more information, it's hard to proceed. However, if we assume that the problem is designed so that the angle PRZ can be determined independently of the other variables, then maybe the initial approach was correct. But why are the other variables present? They might be a distraction, or maybe they are meant to be used to check consistency.

Alternatively, maybe there's an error in assuming that angle PRZ and angle ZRQ are equal. Let me verify that again. 

Since RZ is the angle bisector of angle PRQ, then it divides angle PRQ into two equal angles: angle PRZ and angle ZRQ. Therefore, they should be equal. Hence, 4b -17 = 3b -4 ⇒ b = 13, giving angle PRZ = 35°, which is option D. 

However, the presence of other variables suggests that there might be additional constraints. For example, if we plug b=13 into angle QYR = 7b +6 = 7*13 +6 = 97°, and angle QRY = 70°, then in triangle QYR, the third angle at Q is 104 -7b = 104 -91 = 13°. So angle YQR = 13°. 

Then, angle YQR is 13°, which is part of angle PQR. But angle PQR is also related to other parts. For example, in triangle PQR, angles at Q, R, and P sum to 180°. We know angle at R is PRQ = 70°, and angle at Q is something, and angle at P is something. But without more info, it's hard to say. 

However, if we consider that angle YQR = 13°, and Y is on PR, then maybe there's some relation with other angles. For example, if we look at triangle QYP or something. But again, not enough info. 

Alternatively, maybe we can find a relation between a and c using the Angle Bisector Theorem. 

From earlier, we had:

(a +5)/(3a -11) = PR / RQ.

But PR = 6c -12. So:

(a +5)/(3a -11) = (6c -12)/RQ.

But we need another equation to relate RQ with other variables. However, if we can find RQ in terms of other quantities. 

Wait, RQ is a side of triangle PQR. If we can find RQ using other information. For example, maybe using the Law of Sines in triangle PRQ? 

In triangle PRQ, angles are:

At R: 70°,

At Q: angle PQR = let's call it α,

At P: angle QPR = β.

So α + β + 70 = 180 ⇒ α + β = 110°.

But without knowing individual values of α and β, it's hard to proceed. However, if we can relate α to angle YQR. Earlier, we found angle YQR = 13°, which is part of angle PQR. If Y is on PR, then angle YQR is the same as angle PQR if Y coincides with P, but since Y is on PR, it depends on where Y is. 

Alternatively, suppose that line QY divides angle PQR into two parts. For example, angle PQR is split into angle PQY and angle YQR. But since Y is on PR, then angle YQR is part of angle PQR. 

But without knowing where Y is on PR, we can't determine the exact relation. However, if we assume that Y divides PR in some ratio, maybe related to the given PY and YR. 

Indeed, PY = 2c -1 and YR = 4c -11. So the ratio PY/YR = (2c -1)/(4c -11). 

If we can relate this ratio to some other ratio, maybe from mass point geometry or something. But since we have a point Y on PR, and QY is a cevian, maybe applying the Law of Sines in triangle QYP and QYR. 

In triangle QYP and QYR, we can write:

In triangle QYP: sin(angle QYP)/PY = sin(angle QPY)/QY.

In triangle QYR: sin(angle QYR)/YR = sin(angle QRY)/QY.

But this seems complex. However, if we consider the Law of Sines in triangle QYR:

sin(angle QYR)/QR = sin(angle QRY)/QY.

Wait, maybe not. Let me recall the Law of Sines: in any triangle, a/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C.

So in triangle QYR, sides are QY, YR, QR. Angles are at Q, Y, R. 

Let me denote:

- angle at Q: angle YQR = 13° (as computed earlier)

- angle at Y: angle QYR = 97°

- angle at R: angle QRY = 70°

Thus, by Law of Sines:

QY / sin(70°) = YR / sin(13°) = QR / sin(97°)

So QY / sin(70°) = YR / sin(13°)

Therefore, QY = YR * sin(70°)/sin(13°)

Plugging numbers:

YR = 4c -11,

QY = ?

But we don't know QY. However, if we can express QY in terms of other variables. 

Alternatively, since Y is on PR, and we know PY and YR, we can express PR = PY + YR = 6c -12 as before. 

But how to relate QY? Maybe using Stewart's theorem? Or something else. 

Alternatively, since we have coordinates? Maybe assigning coordinates to the points and trying to calculate. But this might be time-consuming, but let's attempt.

Let me assign coordinates to simplify the problem. Let me place point Q at (0,0), R at (r,0), and P somewhere in the plane. But since Z is on QP, and RZ is the angle bisector, this might get complex. 

Alternatively, let me consider placing point R at origin, point Q somewhere on x-axis, etc. But this could take too long. 

Alternatively, since we have ratio from Law of Sines in triangle QYR:

QY / YR = sin(70°)/sin(13°)

Which gives QY = YR * sin(70°)/sin(13°)

But YR = 4c -11, so QY = (4c -11)*[sin(70)/sin(13)].

But QY is also a length in the diagram. However, without knowing more about QY, it's hard to proceed. 

But maybe QY is related to other parts via the point A. Since A lies on QY and RZ. But without knowing where A is, it's unclear. 

This seems too indirect. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress on connecting a and c, maybe the initial solution is correct, and the other information is either redundant or intended to mislead. 

Therefore, proceeding with the initial conclusion that angle PRZ is 35°, corresponding to option D. 

But to confirm, let me check if there's any possibility that the angle PRZ is not the bisected angle. For example, if RZ is the bisector of angle QRP instead of PRQ. Wait, angle QRP is the same as angle PRQ. So no difference. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle bisector is of a different angle, like angle PRZ itself? No, because it says RZ is an angle bisector, so it must be bisecting an angle at R, which is angle PRQ. 

Hence, my initial calculation stands. 

Thus, Final Answer: D.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by identifying the critical geometric constraint: **RZ is an angle bisector**. This tells us that the angle $\angle PRZ$ is equal to $\angle ZRQ$, because an angle bisector divides the angle into two congruent parts.

---

### Step 1: Use the Given Angle Expressions

We are told:

$$
\text{Measure of } \angle PRZ = 4b - 17 \\
\text{Measure of } \angle ZRQ = 3b - 4
$$

Because RZ is the angle bisector, these two angles must be equal:

$$
4b - 17 = 3b - 4
$$

Subtract $3b$ from both sides:

$$
b = 13
$$

---

### Step 2: Compute the Measure of $\angle PRZ$

Now substitute $b = 13$ into the expression for $\angle PRZ$:

$$
\angle PRZ = 4b - 17 = 4(13) - 17 = 52 - 17 = 35^\circ
$$

### Step 3: Interpret the Result
