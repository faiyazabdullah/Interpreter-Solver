====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out how to find x here. So we have points A, B, C, D, E, G involved. Let me start by listing all the given information to see if I can visualize or sketch a diagram.

First, the lengths: EC is 9 units. BE and AE are both x. ED is 4 units. Then there are some point-on-line conditions. Point E lies on line AB and also on line CD. Also, points A, B, C, D lie on a circle centered at G with radius 6.0. Wait, so that means A, B, C, D are all on a circle with radius 6. So their distances from G are all 6. But then, what about E? Is E related to this circle? Not directly mentioned, but maybe through other relationships?

Let me try to draw a rough sketch mentally. Since E is on lines AB and CD, it might be the intersection point of those two lines. So AB and CD intersect at E. Given that A, B, C, D are on a circle (maybe a cyclic quadrilateral?), but since they are four points on a circle, perhaps ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral. However, since E is the intersection of AB and CD, which would make E the radical center or something else? Hmm, not sure yet.

But we know EC = 9, ED = 4, BE = AE = x. Let me think about triangles here. If E is on AB, then AE + EB = AB. But since AE = BE = x, then AB = 2x. Similarly, for line CD, since E is on CD, CE + ED = CD. Given CE is 9 and ED is 4, so CD = 13. 

Now, considering that A, B, C, D lie on a circle with center G and radius 6. So GA = GB = GC = GD = 6. Therefore, triangle AGC has sides GA=6, GC=6, and AC as a chord. But how does E relate to these points?

Wait, since E is on AB and CD, maybe power of a point could help here. The Power of a Point theorem states that for a point outside a circle, the product of the lengths of the segments from the point to the circle along a line is equal for any two lines through the point. In this case, E is inside the circle because A and B are on the circle. Wait, no—if E were inside the circle, then EA * EB would equal EC * ED? Wait, Power of a Point formula when the point is inside the circle is that for two chords passing through the point, the products of the segments are equal. 

Yes! So if E is inside the circle, then for chords AB and CD passing through E, we have EA * EB = EC * ED. That seems promising. Let me check that. 

So according to Power of a Point, if two chords intersect at E, then EA * EB = EC * ED. Let me confirm that. Yes, that's right. For example, if two chords AB and CD intersect at E, then EA * EB = EC * ED. 

Given that, plugging in the known values: EA = x, EB = x, EC = 9, ED = 4. So:

EA * EB = x * x = x²  
EC * ED = 9 * 4 = 36  

Therefore, setting them equal: x² = 36 → x = 6. 

Wait, but that gives x = 6. But looking at the answer choices, option A is 6. However, wait—is E actually inside the circle? Because if E is inside the circle, then yes, Power of a Point applies. But why do we know that E is inside the circle?

Because points A and B are on the circle. If E is on segment AB, then E is between A and B. Since A and B are on the circle, the distance from E to the center G... Well, if E is between A and B, then depending on where E is, it could be inside or outside. But if the circle has radius 6, and AB is a chord of the circle, then the length of AB depends on its position. 

Wait, but if AB is a chord of the circle with radius 6, then the maximum possible length of AB is the diameter, which is 12. Here, AB is 2x. If x is 6, then AB is 12, which would mean AB is the diameter. But then, if AB is the diameter, then E is the midpoint of AB, since EA = EB = x = 6. Then E would be the center of the circle? Wait, no. The center G is the center of the circle. If AB is a diameter, then the center G would be the midpoint of AB. But in that case, if E is the midpoint of AB, then E would coincide with G? But unless AB is the diameter, then E is the midpoint. However, in our case, E is also on CD. So if E is the midpoint of AB and also lies on CD, then CD passes through the center of the circle? But CD has length 13 (since EC=9 and ED=4). Wait, but CD is another chord of the circle. But the maximum length of a chord is the diameter, which is 12. But CD is 13, which is longer than the diameter. That's impossible. 

Oh! There's a contradiction here. If CD is a chord of the circle with radius 6, then its maximum length is 12. But EC + ED is 9 + 4 = 13, which would imply CD is 13. Which is longer than the diameter. So that's impossible. Therefore, my earlier assumption that E is inside the circle must be wrong. So perhaps E is outside the circle? Then, Power of a Point would state that EA * EB = EC * ED, but with different signs. Wait, when the point is outside the circle, the power is positive, and for two secant lines, you have EA * EB = EC * ED, where EA and EB are the entire lengths from E to the points on the circle. Wait, let me recall the exact statement.

If E is outside the circle, and two secants pass through E, intersecting the circle at A and B, and C and D respectively, then EA * EB = EC * ED. But in this case, if E is outside, then EA and EB would be the lengths from E to the first intersection point and the second. But in our case, E is on AB and CD. So if E is outside the circle, then AB would be a secant line passing through E, meaning that E is outside, and A and B are points on the circle. So EA and EB would be the distances from E to A and E to B. But since E is outside, then one of EA or EB would be the entire length from E to the circle, and the other would be from E to the other intersection. Wait, but if E is outside, then the line AB passes through E, so E is outside, and A and B are points on the circle. Thus, EA and EB would be the lengths from E to each point. But since E is outside, then either EA or EB would be negative if direction is considered, but in terms of magnitudes, the Power of a Point formula says that EA * EB equals EC * ED. But in this case, since E is outside, the power is equal to the square of the tangent length from E to the circle. 

But regardless, even if E is outside, the formula still holds: EA * EB = EC * ED. So even if E is outside, the same equation applies. However, in that case, the chord CD would have to satisfy that EC and ED are parts of the secant. But if E is outside, then EC and ED would be the lengths from E to C and E to D. Wait, but since E is on CD, then CD is a secant line passing through E. So if E is outside, then one of C or D is between E and the other. Wait, but EC is given as 9, ED is 4. So if E is outside, then suppose E---C---D, such that EC = 9 and ED = 4. But that would require that C is between E and D, but then ED would be EC + CD? Wait, no. Let me think again. If E is outside, and CD is a secant line passing through E, then the points would be arranged as E---C---D or E---D---C. Suppose E is outside, and the line CD passes through E. So if E is outside, then C and D are points on the circle, and E is outside, so the line passes through E and intersects the circle at C and D. So the order would be E---C---D or E---D---C. Depending on which way. 

In this case, EC and ED would be the lengths from E to C and E to D. If E is outside, then EC and ED would be the lengths of the two segments from E to each intersection point. So, for instance, if E is outside, then EC and ED would be the two parts of the secant, so the power of point E with respect to the circle is EC * ED. But since E is outside, the power is equal to the square of the tangent from E to the circle. 

But in this scenario, we have EA * EB = EC * ED. So regardless of whether E is inside or outside, the formula holds. However, in our case, if E is outside, then EA and EB are the lengths from E to A and E to B. But since A and B are on the circle, and E is on AB, then if E is outside, then one of EA or EB would be the entire length from E to the circle, and the other would be from E to the other point. Wait, but since E is on AB, then A and B are points on the circle. So if E is outside, then the line AB extends beyond the circle, passing through E. So for example, E is outside, and A and B are points on the circle such that E is on the extension of AB beyond one of the points. So if E is outside, then one of EA or EB would be negative if considering directed segments, but in terms of magnitude, the product EA * EB would be equal to EC * ED. 

But in this case, we have EA = x and EB = x. So EA * EB = x^2. And EC * ED = 9*4=36. So x^2=36 implies x=6. But earlier, we had a problem where CD would need to be longer than the diameter. But if E is outside, then CD is a secant line passing through E, so EC and ED are parts of the secant. Let me think. If E is outside, then CD is a secant line passing through E, so EC and ED are the lengths from E to C and E to D. So if E is outside, then EC and ED are both measured from E to the points on the circle. So the total length from C to D would be |EC - ED| if they are in the same direction from E, or EC + ED if they are in opposite directions. Wait, for example, if E is outside, and the points C and D are on the line such that E---C---D, then EC is the distance from E to C, and ED is the distance from E to D. So CD = ED - EC. Or if E is outside, and the line goes through E, then C and D are on opposite sides of E. So suppose E is outside, and the line passes through E, going through C and then D. So the order would be E---C---D, making EC = 9 and ED = EC + CD. Wait, no. If E is outside, and the line passes through E, then moving from E towards the circle, you hit C, then continue past C to D. Wait, but D is also on the circle. So if E is outside, then the line passes through E, then intersects the circle at two points. So the points would be ordered as E---C---D, or E---D---C. Either way, the length from E to C and E to D would depend on their positions. 

Suppose the points are arranged as E---C---D, with EC = 9 and ED = 4. Wait, but that would mean that from E to C is 9, and from E to D is 4, which would require that D is closer to E than C is. But then CD would be EC - ED = 9 - 4 = 5. But in our case, EC is 9 and ED is 4. Wait, that would only happen if D is between E and C. So the arrangement would be E---D---C, with ED = 4, DC = EC - ED = 9 - 4 = 5. So CD = 5. But then CD is a chord of the circle. The maximum length of a chord is the diameter, 12. So 5 is okay. 

Wait, but in this case, if E is outside the circle, then EC and ED are the lengths from E to the points on the circle. So the Power of a Point formula would say that EC * ED = EA * EB. So 9*4 = x*x => x^2=36 => x=6. 

So even though CD is a chord of length 5, which is less than the diameter 12, that's acceptable. Therefore, x=6. But then, the answer choice A is 6. But wait, the initial thought was that if E is inside, then CD would have to be longer than diameter, but that led to a contradiction. But if E is outside, then CD is shorter. 

However, there's another thing to consider. If E is outside the circle, then the Power of a Point formula applies. But we also need to check whether the points A, B, C, D being on the circle with radius 6 allows for such distances. 

For example, take point E outside the circle. Let's assume that x=6. So EA=EB=6. So the points A and B are on the circle, and E is located such that EA=EB=6. So E is somewhere outside the circle. Now, the distance from E to A is 6, and since A is on the circle (radius 6), the distance from E to the center G can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem if we consider the line EA and the radius GA. 

Wait, if E is outside the circle, then the distance from E to G would be more than the radius. Let me think. Let’s denote O as the center of the circle (point G). Then OA = OB = OC = OD = 6. Let’s consider triangle OAE. We know OA = 6, EA = 6, and OE is unknown. Using the Law of Cosines, OE² = OA² + EA² - 2 * OA * EA * cos(theta), where theta is the angle between OA and EA. But without knowing theta, we can’t compute OE directly. However, since E is outside, the power of E with respect to the circle is equal to EO² - r² = EA * EB. 

Power of a Point formula: For a point E outside the circle, the power is equal to the square of the tangent from E to the circle, which is also equal to EA * EB. 

Since EA = EB = x, then the power is x². 

Also, power = EO² - r². 

So, x² = EO² - 6². 

Thus, EO² = x² + 36. 

But we don't know EO. However, if we can find EO from other relations, but maybe not necessary. 

Alternatively, since CD is a chord of the circle with length CD = 5 (if E is outside), then the distance from the center O to the chord CD can be computed. 

The length of chord CD is 5. The formula for the length of a chord is 2√(r² - d²), where d is the distance from the center to the chord. 

So, 5 = 2√(6² - d²) → √(36 - d²) = 5/2 → 36 - d² = 25/4 → d² = 36 - 25/4 = (144 - 25)/4 = 119/4 → d = √(119)/2 ≈ 5.45. 

But this distance d is the distance from center O to chord CD. However, since E lies on CD, the distance from E to O can be related to d. But unless we know where E is relative to CD, it's hard to tell. But since E is outside the circle, and CD is a chord, the distance from E to O would depend on the position of E along CD. 

But perhaps this isn't necessary for solving the problem. The key was that applying Power of a Point gives us x² = 36, leading to x = 6. 

But then why did we initially think there was a contradiction? Because if E were inside, CD would have to be longer than diameter, which wasn't possible. But if E is outside, CD can be shorter. Hence, x=6 is valid. 

So the answer should be A. But let me double-check. 

Another approach: Coordinates. Maybe assign coordinates to simplify. Let me try that. 

Assume the circle is centered at G(0,0), radius 6. Points A, B, C, D are on this circle. Let me try to set up coordinates. 

Let me assume that points A and B are symmetric with respect to the x-axis or something. But since E is on AB and CD. Let me suppose that AB is horizontal for simplicity. Let me place E somewhere. 

Alternatively, since E lies on AB and CD, and we have EA=EB=x, so E is the midpoint of AB. Wait, if EA=EB, then E is the midpoint of AB. Therefore, AB is a chord of the circle, with midpoint at E. So the line AB passes through E, which is the midpoint of AB. 

Similarly, CD is another chord passing through E. 

So for chord AB, since E is its midpoint, then the line AB is perpendicular to the line joining the center G to the midpoint E. Wait, no. The line from the center to the midpoint of a chord is perpendicular to the chord. So if E is the midpoint of AB, then GE is perpendicular to AB. 

But if E is the midpoint of AB, then AB is a chord whose midpoint is E. So the distance from G to AB is the distance from G to E, since E lies on the line AB. 

Wait, but if E is the midpoint of AB, then GE is the line connecting the center to the midpoint of AB, which is perpendicular to AB. 

But then, for chord CD passing through E, which is the midpoint of AB. So CD is another chord passing through E. 

Now, the length of AB can be found based on the distance from G to AB. Let me denote h as the distance from G to AB. Then, since AB is a chord of the circle with radius 6, the length of AB is 2√(r² - h²) = 2√(36 - h²). 

But since E is the midpoint of AB, then the distance from G to AB is h, and the distance from E to G can be found via Pythagoras. Because the line GE connects the center G to the midpoint E of AB, which is perpendicular to AB. So triangle GEA is a right triangle with legs GE and half of AB, and hypotenuse GA = 6. 

Wait, no. Actually, the distance from G to AB is h, and the length from E to G is sqrt(r² - (AB/2)^2)? No, wait. Let me clarify. 

The standard formula for the length of a chord is 2√(r² - d²), where d is the distance from the center to the chord. In this case, AB is a chord, and the distance from G to AB is h. Then AB = 2√(r² - h²). 

But since E is the midpoint of AB, and GE is the line from G to the midpoint of AB, which is perpendicular to AB. So the length of GE is h. 

Now, the distance from E to G is h. 

Additionally, since E is the midpoint of AB, and EA = x, then AB = 2x. Therefore, AB = 2x = 2√(36 - h²) ⇒ x = √(36 - h²). 

Now, for chord CD passing through E. Let me consider the same logic. The length of CD is 13? Wait, earlier we said that EC = 9, ED = 4, so CD = EC + ED = 13? Wait, no. If E is on CD, then CD could be split into EC and ED depending on the position of E. 

Earlier, we assumed that E is outside the circle, so that CD is a secant line passing through E, with E outside. So for example, E---C---D, with EC = 9 and ED = 4, but that would mean CD = ED - EC? No, if E is outside, then the points are arranged such that E is outside, and the line passes through E, then intersects the circle at C and D. So if E is outside, then one of the points is between E and the other. For example, if the line passes through E, then enters the circle at C, exits at D, then E is outside, so the order is E---C---D. Then, EC is the distance from E to C, and ED is the distance from E to D. So CD = ED - EC. So CD = 4 - 9? No, that would be negative. Wait, that can't be. 

Ah, here's the confusion. If E is outside the circle, and the line passes through E and intersects the circle at C and D, then the points are arranged as E---C---D or E---D---C. Let me define the lengths properly. 

If E is outside, and the line passes through E, then intersects the circle at C and D. So starting from E, moving along the line, you first meet C, then go further to D. So the distances would be EC and ED, where EC is from E to C, and ED is from E to D. Therefore, CD = ED - EC. So in this case, if EC = 9 and ED = 4, then CD = 4 - 9 = -5, which is not possible. This suggests that my previous assumption is incorrect. 

Alternatively, if the points are arranged as C---E---D, then EC = 9 and ED = 4. But then CD = EC + ED = 13. But CD is a chord of the circle, which has maximum length 12. So that's impossible. Hence, contradiction. 

This suggests that if E is outside the circle, then CD cannot be longer than the diameter. Therefore, if EC = 9 and ED = 4, then CD = 13, which exceeds the maximum possible length of a chord (diameter 12). Hence, this is impossible. 

Wait, but earlier we thought that if E is outside, then CD could be shorter. So where is the mistake here?

Let me re-examine the setup. If E is outside the circle, and line CD passes through E, intersecting the circle at C and D. Then, the Power of a Point tells us that EC * ED = EA * EB. But EC and ED are signed lengths, depending on the direction. But if we take absolute values, then EC * ED is equal to EA * EB. However, the actual length CD is |ED - EC| if E is outside and the points are arranged as E---C---D or similar. 

Wait, if E is outside, and the line passes through E, entering the circle at C, exiting at D, then the distances from E would be EC (from E to C) and ED (from E to D). So CD is the distance between C and D, which would be ED - EC. But since E is outside, and assuming that E is beyond C away from D, then ED = EC + CD. So CD = ED - EC. 

But if EC = 9 and ED = 4, then CD = 4 - 9 = -5, which is invalid. Hence, this suggests that the assumption that E is outside is wrong. 

Alternatively, if the points are arranged as C---D---E, then EC = CD + DE. So EC = CD + DE. If EC = 9 and DE = 4, then CD = 9 - 4 = 5. So CD = 5, which is feasible. 

Wait, in this case, if the line passes through C, then D, then E. So E is outside, and the line passes through C and D (on the circle), with E beyond D. Then, EC is the distance from E to C, which would be ED + DC = 4 + 5 = 9. So EC = 9, ED = 4, CD = 5. 

That works! So CD is 5, which is possible as a chord. Hence, there's no contradiction. 

So in this case, the Power of a Point formula holds: EC * ED = 9 * 4 = 36 = x² → x = 6. 

So even though CD is 5, which is less than the diameter of 12, it's acceptable. Therefore, x = 6. 

Hence, the answer should be A. 

But why did I get confused before? Because I misapplied the ordering of the points. Once corrected, CD = 5 is fine. 

Therefore, the correct value of x is 6, corresponding to answer choice A.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration described:

- **Points A, B, C, D** lie on a common circle centered at $ G $ with radius 6.
- **Point E** lies on the lines $ \overline{AB} $ and $ \overline{CD} $.
- The lengths are given as:
  - $ \text{Length}( \overline{EC} ) = 9 $
  - $ \text{Length}( \overline{BE} ) = x $
  - $ \text{Length}( \overline{AE} ) = x $
  - $ \text{Length}( \overline{ED} ) = 4 $

---

### Step 1: Applying the **Power of a Point Theorem**

The Power of a Point Theorem states that if two chords intersect at a point $ E $ inside or outside a circle, then the product of the lengths of the segments of one chord equals the product of the lengths of the segments of the other chord. Specifically:

$$
\text{EA} \cdot \text{EB} = \text{EC} \cdot \text{ED}
$$

Substitute the known values:

$$
x \cdot x = 9 \cdot 4
\Rightarrow x^2 = 36
\Rightarrow x = \sqrt{36} = 6
$$

---

### Step 2: Validating the Geometry

We verify that this result aligns with the geometric constraints:

- $ x = 6 \Rightarrow \text{EA} = \text{EB} = 6 \Rightarrow \text{AB} = 12 $
- Maximum possible length of a chord in a circle of radius 6 is the **diameter**, which is $ 2 \times 6 = 12 $. So $ AB = 12 $ is valid — this suggests $ E $ is the **midpoint** of $ \overline{AB} $, consistent with the condition $ \text{EA} = \text{EB} $.
- For $ \overline{CD} $, with $ \text{EC} = 9 $ and $ \text{ED} = 4 $, the total length $ \text{CD} = 13 $, but this contradicts the idea that $ E $ is **inside** the circle (as a chord longer than the diameter is not possible).

Instead, this indicates that **$ E $ lies outside** the circle, and the line $ \overline{CD} $ passes through $ E $ such that:
- One endpoint is closer to $ E $ than the other,
- i.e., the configuration is $ C $—$ D $—$ E $, with $ \text{EC} = 9 $, $ \text{ED} = 4 $, and thus $ \text{CD} = 5 $, which is within the allowable range for a chord in a circle of radius 6.

Hence, the configuration is consistent with both the Power of a Point and the constraint that all points lie on a circle of radius 6.

---

### Final Conclusion

From the application of the Power of a Point Theorem and validation against the circle’s geometric limits, the value of $ x $ is unambiguously determined to be:

$$
x = 6
$$
