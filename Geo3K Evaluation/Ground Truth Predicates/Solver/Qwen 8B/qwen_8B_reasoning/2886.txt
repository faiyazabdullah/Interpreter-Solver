MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out how to find the measure of angle D. Hmm, first I need to visualize the problem based on the given constraints. Let me start by listing out all the information provided.

We have points A, B, C, D lying on a circle centered at O with radius 5.0. So, O is the center of the circle, and all these points are on the circumference. That means OA = OB = OC = OD = 5 units. 

The angles mentioned are:

- Measure of angle ABC (Angle(A,B,C)) is 3y + 4 degrees.
- Measure of angle BAD (Angle(B,A,D)) is 58 degrees.
- Measure of angle ADC (Angle(A,D,C)) is 2y + 16 degrees.
- Measure of angle BCD (Angle(B,C,D)) is 2x degrees.

Wait, but we need to find m∠D. Wait, which angle? The question says "m∠D". But angle D could refer to different angles depending on context. Maybe it refers to angle ADC or something else? Or maybe it's referring to angle at point D, like ∠ADC or ∠ADB? Wait, since the points are on a circle, perhaps there's some cyclic quadrilateral involved here?

Let me think again. Since all points lie on the same circle, they form a cyclic quadrilateral? But wait, four points on a circle can form a cyclic quadrilateral only if they are connected in order. However, the exact configuration isn't given. But maybe we can assume that ABCD is a quadrilateral inscribed in the circle. If so, then opposite angles might sum to 180 degrees. But first, I need to clarify the positions of the points.

Alternatively, maybe triangle relationships? Let me consider each angle given:

First, angle at B, between points A, B, C: Angle ABC = 3y + 4. Then angle at A between points B, A, D: angle BAD = 58 degrees. Then angle at D between points A, D, C: angle ADC = 2y +16. And angle at C between points B, C, D: angle BCD = 2x degrees.

So, perhaps ABCD is a quadrilateral with vertices A, B, C, D in order around the circle. Therefore, forming a cyclic quadrilateral. In that case, the sum of opposite angles would be 180 degrees. However, angle BAD and angle BCD are two opposite angles? Wait, if ABCD is cyclic, then angle BAD and angle BCD would be opposite angles. Wait, no. Let me recall: in a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles are supplementary. So angle A + angle C = 180°, angle B + angle D = 180°. But here, angle BAD is at vertex A, and angle BCD is at vertex C. So those would be opposite angles. So angle BAD + angle BCD = 180°. Is that right?

But angle BAD is given as 58°, so angle BCD would be 180° - 58° = 122°. But angle BCD is given as 2x. Therefore, 2x = 122°, so x = 61°. Wait, but is that valid? Wait, but angle BAD is part of the quadrilateral. Wait, but angle BAD is angle at A, so in the quadrilateral ABCD, angle at A is angle BAD? Wait, depends on how the points are ordered. Suppose the quadrilateral is A-B-C-D-A. Then angle at A would be between BA and DA, which is angle BAD. Yes. Then angle at C would be between BC and DC, which is angle BCD. So yes, angle BAD and angle BCD are opposite angles in cyclic quadrilateral ABCD. Hence their sum should be 180°. Therefore, angle BAD (which is 58°) plus angle BCD (which is 2x) equals 180°. Thus, 58 + 2x = 180 → 2x = 122 → x = 61. So x=61.

Now, moving on. Also, there are angles at B and D. Let me check other angles. For example, angle ABC is given as 3y +4. Which is angle at B between points A, B, C. Similarly, angle ADC is given as 2y +16, which is angle at D between points A, D, C. So angle ABC and angle ADC are also opposite angles? Wait, if ABCD is cyclic, then angle ABC and angle ADC are opposite angles? Wait, angle ABC is at vertex B, angle ADC is at vertex D. So yes, those would be opposite angles. Hence, angle ABC + angle ADC = 180°. Therefore:

(3y +4) + (2y +16) = 180

Combine terms:

3y + 2y + 4 +16 = 180

5y + 20 = 180 → 5y = 160 → y = 32.

So y is 32. Then, we can compute angle ABC = 3*32 +4 = 96 +4 = 100°, and angle ADC = 2*32 +16 = 64 +16 = 80°. 

Wait, so angle ADC is 80°, which is at point D. But the question asks for m∠D. So is angle ADC equal to angle D? Well, angle ADC is the angle at point D between points A, D, C. So that would be angle ADC, which is indeed angle D if we're considering the quadrilateral ABCD. But depending on notation, sometimes angle D could refer to another angle. But given the way the problem is set up, with points A, B, C, D on the circle, and the angles given, angle ADC is likely the angle at D, so m∠D = 80°, which would correspond to option C. 

But let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe there's more to it. Because the problem mentions points on a circle, so maybe using arcs or central angles?

Wait, but the given angles are inscribed angles. Let me confirm. For instance, angle ABC is an inscribed angle. Since points A, B, C, D are on the circle, angle ABC is formed by chords AB and BC, so it's an inscribed angle subtending arc AC. Similarly, angle ADC is an inscribed angle subtending arc AC. Wait, because angle at D, between A and C, so subtends arc AC. So both angles ABC and ADC subtend arc AC, meaning they are equal? Wait, but according to our previous calculation, angle ABC was 100°, angle ADC was 80°, which contradicts that. Wait, so that suggests that my assumption that ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral may be incorrect? Or maybe my understanding of which angles subtend which arcs is wrong.

Wait, hold on. Let me re-examine. If ABCD is cyclic, then angles subtended by the same arc should be equal. But angle ABC and angle ADC both subtend arc AC. Wait, but in reality, angle ABC is an inscribed angle subtending arc AC, while angle ADC is also an inscribed angle subtending arc AC. Therefore, they should be equal. But according to our earlier calculation, they were 100° and 80°, which is inconsistent. So that suggests that there is a mistake in assuming that ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral. Wait, but all the points are on the same circle. So ABCD must be cyclic. So why is there inconsistency here?

This contradiction implies that my initial approach has an error. Let me go back.

If ABCD is cyclic, then angle ABC and angle ADC should be equal. But according to the equations above, they are not. Therefore, my assumption about which angles are opposite must be wrong. Let me re-express.

In cyclic quadrilaterals, the opposite angles are supplementary. So angle A + angle C = 180°, angle B + angle D = 180°. But angle BAD is angle A. Angle BCD is angle C. Wait, if ABCD is cyclic, then angle BAD and angle BCD are opposite angles. Wait, angle BAD is at vertex A, and angle BCD is at vertex C. So yes, they are opposite. Then angle BAD + angle BCD = 180°, as before. So angle BAD = 58°, angle BCD = 2x. Therefore, 58 + 2x = 180 => x = 61. Then, angle ABC and angle ADC: angle ABC is at vertex B, angle ADC is at vertex D. These are also opposite angles. Therefore, angle ABC + angle ADC = 180°. So angle ABC = 3y +4, angle ADC = 2y +16. Adding them gives 5y + 20 = 180, leading to y=32. Then angle ABC = 3*32 +4 = 100°, angle ADC = 2*32 +16 = 80°. But if ABCD is cyclic, then angle ABC and angle ADC should be supplementary, but 100 + 80 = 180. Oh! Wait, 100 + 80 is 180. So that works. Earlier confusion was due to miscalculating. So angle ABC is 100°, angle ADC is 80°, adding to 180. So that checks out. So angle ABC and angle ADC are opposite angles in the cyclic quadrilateral, hence supplementary. So that's okay. So that seems consistent.

Therefore, angle ADC is 80°, which is at point D. So m∠D is 80°, which is option C. So the answer should be C. 

But let me make sure that there isn't another interpretation. For example, maybe angle D refers to another angle. For instance, if the diagram shows angle at D as something else. Wait, the problem states "Find m∠D." Without more context, it's standard to interpret ∠D as the angle at point D. In the quadrilateral ABCD, the angles at D would be angle ADC or angle ADB or something else? Wait, in the quadrilateral ABCD, the angle at D is angle ADC. Because when you connect the quadrilateral, the sides at D are CD and DA. So the angle between CD and DA is angle ADC. So yes, that is ∠D. Therefore, m∠D is 80°, which is option C.

But let me check once more if there's another possible angle. For example, if there's a triangle involving D. For instance, maybe triangle ADC? But angle ADC is already considered. Or triangle BCD? No, angle BCD is given as 2x. So unless there's another angle at D. Wait, but in the given angles, the only angle at D mentioned is angle ADC. Unless there's another angle. But the problem only provides specific angles, so probably ∠D refers to angle ADC. 

Another thing to check: the fact that all points lie on the circle. Are there any implications from that? For example, if we consider the arcs. Let me see. For instance, angle ABC is an inscribed angle over arc AC. Similarly, angle ADC is also an inscribed angle over arc AC. Therefore, they should be equal. But according to our calculation, they are 100° and 80°, which contradict. Wait, that's confusing. How come?

Wait, if ABCD is cyclic, then angle ABC and angle ADC both subtend arc AC. Wait, but if ABCD is cyclic, then points A, B, C, D are on the circle. So angle ABC subtends arc AC, but angle ADC also subtends arc AC. Therefore, they should be equal. However, according to our calculation, they are not. This discrepancy suggests that there's a misunderstanding here. Where is the mistake?

Ah! Wait, angle ABC is not necessarily subtending arc AC. Let me think again. An inscribed angle subtends the arc opposite to it. So angle at B, between points A, B, C: it subtends arc AC. But if the quadrilateral is convex, then depending on the position of the points, the arc could be major or minor arc. Wait, but in a cyclic quadrilateral, the inscribed angle subtended by arc AC would depend on whether the angle is acute or obtuse. Wait, but if angle ABC and angle ADC are both subtending arc AC, then they should be equal. However, according to the values we found, they are not equal. So this indicates that either the quadrilateral is not convex, or there's a misinterpretation.

Wait, but angle ABC is 100°, angle ADC is 80°. So they are not equal. So that suggests that they do not subtend the same arc. Therefore, my assumption that they subtend arc AC is wrong. So maybe angle ABC subtends a different arc. Let me think again.

When you have angle ABC in a cyclic quadrilateral, it actually subtends arc ADC. Wait, no. Wait, the inscribed angle at B subtends arc AC, but if the quadrilateral is labeled in order, then the angle at B would subtend arc from A to C passing through D. Wait, maybe the arc that does not contain B. So if the quadrilateral is ABCD, then angle at B subtends arc ADC, whereas angle at D subtends arc ABC. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Let me recall that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So angle ABC intercepts arc ADC, while angle ADC intercepts arc ABC. Therefore, angle ABC = ½(arc ADC), angle ADC = ½(arc ABC). Therefore, angle ABC + angle ADC = ½(arc ADC) + ½(arc ABC) = ½(arc ADC + arc ABC). But since the total circumference is 360°, arc ADC + arc ABC = 360°, so angle ABC + angle ADC = ½ * 360° = 180°. Which confirms that angle ABC + angle ADC = 180°, which matches the cyclic quadrilateral property. Therefore, even though angle ABC and angle ADC are not subtending the same arc, their sum is 180°, which is consistent.

So that resolves the earlier confusion. So angle ABC and angle ADC are not subtending the same arc, but their sum is 180°, which fits with the cyclic quadrilateral. Therefore, our calculation is correct. So angle ADC is 80°, which is m∠D. So answer is C.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is C, 80°, so Final Answer: C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $\angle D$, we begin by analyzing the geometric setup and applying key principles related to **cyclic quadrilaterals** and **inscribed angles**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Configuration

All points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ lie on a circle centered at $O$. This makes them the vertices of a **cyclic quadrilateral**, i.e., a quadrilateral whose vertices all lie on a single circle. One important property of such quadrilaterals is that **opposite angles are supplementary** (i.e., their measures add up to $180^\circ$).

Additionally, several angle expressions are given:

- $\angle ABC = 3y + 4$
- $\angle BAD = 58^\circ$
- $\angle ADC = 2y + 16$
- $\angle BCD = 2x$

Our goal is to find the measure of $\angle D$. Based on the standard notation used in cyclic quadrilaterals, $\angle D$ corresponds to $\angle ADC$, which is the angle at vertex $D$.

---

### Step 2: Use Opposite Angles in a Cyclic Quadrilateral

From the cyclic quadrilateral property:

$$
\angle BAD + \angle BCD = 180^\circ
$$

Substitute known values:

$$
58 + 2x = 180 \Rightarrow 2x = 122 \Rightarrow x = 61
$$

Also, for the pair of opposite angles $\angle ABC$ and $\angle ADC$:

$$
\angle ABC + \angle ADC = 180^\circ
$$

Substitute the expressions:

$$
(3y + 4) + (2y + 16) = 180
\Rightarrow 5y + 20 = 180
\Rightarrow 5y = 160
\Rightarrow y = 32
$$

---

### Step 3: Compute the Value of $\angle D$

Recall that $\angle D = \angle ADC = 2y + 16$. Substitute $y = 32$:

$$
\angle ADC = 2(32) + 16 = 64 + 16 = 80^\circ
$$

Thus, the measure of $\angle D$ is:

$$
\boxed{80}
$$

### Final Answer:

$$
\text{Final Answer: C}
