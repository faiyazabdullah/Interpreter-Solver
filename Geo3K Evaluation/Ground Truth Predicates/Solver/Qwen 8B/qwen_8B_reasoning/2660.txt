MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. So I need to find the length of line BC, which is denoted as x. The problem gives me that AB is 13 units, AC is 22 units, and BC is perpendicular to BA. Wait, hold on, Perpendicular(Line(B, C), Line(B, A)). So that means lines BC and BA are perpendicular. Let me visualize this.

Let me try to draw a rough sketch mentally. Points A, B, and C. The line BA is one side, and BC is perpendicular to it. So point B is connected to both A and C. Since BC is perpendicular to BA, then triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at point B? Because BA and BC are perpendicular. So angle at B is 90 degrees. Therefore, triangle ABC is right-angled at B. 

Wait, but in a right-angled triangle, the Pythagorean theorem applies. So AB² + BC² = AC². But wait, AB is 13, BC is x, and AC is 22. So plugging into the formula:

AB² + BC² = AC²  
So 13² + x² = 22²  
Calculating that: 169 + x² = 484  
Then x² = 484 - 169  
Let me compute 484 minus 169. Hmm, 484 - 160 is 324, then subtract 9 more: 324 - 9 = 315. So x² = 315  
Therefore x = sqrt(315). Simplify sqrt(315). Let's factor 315. Divided by 5 first: 315 ÷ 5 = 63. Then 63 is 9*7. So sqrt(5*9*7) = 3*sqrt(35). So sqrt(315) simplifies to 3√35. 

Looking at the answer choices, option C is 3√35. So that would be the answer. Wait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes mistakes happen.

First, confirming the right angle: since BC is perpendicular to BA, so yes, angle at B is 90 degrees. Therefore, triangle ABC is right-angled at B. Hence, AB and BC are legs, AC is hypotenuse. So Pythagoras applies. AB=13, BC=x, AC=22. So 13² + x² = 22². Calculated 13² is 169, 22² is 484. Subtracting gives 484-169=315. Correct. Then sqrt(315)=sqrt(9*35)=3√35. Yes, so answer C. 

But let me check if there's another way this could be interpreted. For example, maybe the coordinates? Suppose we assign coordinates to points. Let me try that approach for verification.

Let’s place point B at the origin (0,0). Since BA is a line, and BC is perpendicular to BA. Let me assume BA is along the x-axis. So point B is at (0,0), point A is somewhere along the x-axis. Let's say A is at (a, 0). Then BC is perpendicular to BA, so BC would be vertical if BA is horizontal. So point C would be at (0, c) for some c. Wait, no. If BA is along the x-axis from B(0,0) to A(a,0), then vector BA is (a,0). A line perpendicular to BA would have direction (0,1) or (0,-1). So point C would lie along the y-axis. So coordinates of C would be (0, c). Then distance BC is from (0,0) to (0,c): |c|. Distance AC is from A(a,0) to C(0,c): sqrt((a)^2 + (c)^2). Given that AC is 22, so sqrt(a² + c²) = 22. Also, AB is the distance from A to B, which is |a| = 13. So a = 13 or -13. Let's take a =13. Then sqrt(13² + c²) =22. Which leads to same equation as before: 13² + c² = 22² => c²= 484 - 169 = 315 => c= sqrt(315)=3√35. So BC is |c|=3√35. So same answer. Therefore, answer is C.

Alternatively, maybe someone might think that the right angle is at C or something else, but the problem says Perpendicular(Line(B,C), Line(B,A)), meaning that lines BC and BA are perpendicular. So they meet at point B, hence the right angle is at B. So the previous reasoning holds. 

Another possible mistake could be miscalculating 22 squared minus 13 squared. Let me verify again: 22 squared is 484, 13 squared is 169. 484 - 169. Let me do 484 - 170 would be 314, then add 1: 315. Correct. So x²=315. So sqrt(315) is indeed 3√35. Because 35*9 is 315. So that's correct.

Looking at the answer choices, option C is 3√35. So the answer should be C. 

I don't see any other possibilities here. The key was recognizing the right angle at B and applying Pythagoras correctly. All steps seem valid. Therefore, confident that answer is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x = \text{LengthOf}(Line(B, C)) $, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration described in the problem.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Geometric Configuration

We are told:
- $ AB = 13 $
- $ AC = 22 $
- $ \overline{BC} \perp \overline{BA} $

This implies that **angle at point B** is a right angle, making triangle $ \triangle ABC $ a **right triangle** with the right angle at vertex $ B $. Therefore, sides $ AB $ and $ BC $ are the legs, and side $ AC $ is the hypotenuse.

---

### Step 2: Use the Pythagorean Theorem

In a right triangle, the relationship between the sides is governed by the Pythagorean Theorem:

$$
AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2
$$

Substitute known values:
- $ AB = 13 $
- $ AC = 22 $
- $ BC = x $

$$
13^2 + x^2 = 22^2 \\
169 + x^2 = 484
$$

Now isolate $ x^2 $:

$$
x^2 = 484 - 169 = 315
$$

Take the square root of both sides:

$$
x = \sqrt{315}
$$

---

### Step 3: Simplify the Square Root

Factorize $ 315 $:

$$
315 = 9 \times 35
\Rightarrow \sqrt{315} = \sqrt{9 \cdot 35} = \sqrt{9} \cdot \sqrt{35} = 3\sqrt{35}
$$

---

### Final Answer

The value of $ x $ is therefore $ 3\sqrt{35} $, which matches **Answer Choice C**.

$$
\boxed{\text{C}}
$$

Final Answer: C
