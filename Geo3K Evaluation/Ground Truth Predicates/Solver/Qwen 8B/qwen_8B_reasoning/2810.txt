Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have quadrilateral ABCD which is a rectangle. The question gives us that angle 1 measures 38 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle 2. 

First, I should recall some properties of rectangles. In a rectangle, all angles are right angles, meaning each angle is 90 degrees. Wait, but the problem mentions angles labeled 1 through 8, so maybe these aren't the angles of the rectangle itself? Let me check the given constraints again.

The problem states several equalities between angles. For example, angle at DCG equals angle 7, angle CGD equals angle 8, angle ADC equals angle 3, etc. Also, there are points lying on lines and perpendicularity conditions. Hmm. Let me try to visualize the diagram based on the constraints.

We know that point G lies on line DA and also on line BC. Since ABCD is a rectangle, DA and BC are opposite sides, so they are parallel. But since G is on both DA and BC, that suggests that DA and BC intersect at point G? Wait, no, because DA and BC are opposite sides of the rectangle, so they shouldn't intersect unless the rectangle is degenerate. That can't be. Maybe G is a point along those lines?

Wait, PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(D,A)) means G is somewhere on DA. Similarly, PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(B,C)) means G is on BC. Therefore, G is the intersection point of DA and BC. But in a rectangle, DA and BC are opposite sides, so they are parallel and don't intersect unless extended. Oh, right! So maybe DA and BC are extended to meet at point G? Because otherwise, if it's a standard rectangle, DA and BC are parallel and wouldn't intersect. Therefore, G must lie outside the rectangle where DA and BC meet when extended.

Also, there's a condition that line BA is perpendicular to line BD. Wait, Perpendicular(Line(B,A), Line(B,D)). So BA is perpendicular to BD. Let me sketch this mentally. Let me consider coordinates to make it easier.

Let me assign coordinates to the rectangle. Let me assume ABCD is a rectangle with points A, B, C, D. Let me think of standard positions. Let me place point A at (0,0). Then, since it's a rectangle, suppose AB is horizontal and AD is vertical. So if AB is horizontal, then point B would be at (a, 0) for some a. Point D would be at (0, b) for some b. Then point C would be at (a, b). Now, DA goes from D(0,b) to A(0,0), so DA is the vertical line x=0. BC goes from B(a,0) to C(a,b), which is the vertical line x=a. So DA and BC are both vertical lines, hence parallel. Their intersection point G would require them to meet, but they are parallel unless extended. Wait, but the problem says that G lies on both DA and BC. That only makes sense if DA and BC are the same line, which they aren't. Therefore, my coordinate assumption might be wrong. Alternatively, perhaps DA and BC are not vertical and horizontal? Or maybe the rectangle is rotated?

Alternatively, maybe the rectangle isn't aligned with axes. Let me think again. Let me consider another approach. Since BA is perpendicular to BD. So, BA ⊥ BD. Let me take point B as origin. Let me set up coordinates such that point B is at (0,0). Let me define BA as one axis and BD as another. Since BA is perpendicular to BD, then BA could be along x-axis and BD along y-axis. Wait, but BD connects points B and D. So if BA is horizontal and BD is vertical, then D would be along the vertical line from B. Let me try:

Let me fix coordinate system with point B at (0,0). Let’s say BA is along positive x-axis, so point A is at (a, 0) for some a > 0. BD is perpendicular to BA, so BD is vertical upwards. Let me say point D is at (0, d) for some d > 0. Since ABCD is a rectangle, vector BA should be equal to vector CD, and vector BC equal to vector AD. Wait, maybe I need to determine coordinates of C. In a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So from point B(0,0), moving along BA to A(a, 0), then from A, moving upward to D? No, wait. Wait, in a rectangle, the order of the vertices matters. Quadrilateral ABCD is a rectangle, so the order is A-B-C-D-A. So edges are AB, BC, CD, DA. So AB is connected to BC, which is connected to CD, which is connected to DA, back to AB.

So given that, with B at (0,0), A at (a, 0). Then, since AB is horizontal, BC should be vertical upwards? Not necessarily. Wait, but BA is perpendicular to BD. So BD is a diagonal from B(0,0) to D. Since BA is horizontal (from B(0,0) to A(a,0)), BD is vertical, so D is (0,d). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, the coordinates of C can be determined. From point B(0,0) to C, which should be same as from A(a,0) to D(0,d)? Wait, no. In a rectangle, vectors AB and DC are equal, and vectors AD and BC are equal. Vector AB is (a,0) - (0,0) = (a,0). Vector DC should be same. Point D is (0,d). So point C would be D + vector AB. So vector AB is (a,0), so adding that to D(0,d) gives C at (a, d). Then, vector BC is from B(0,0) to C(a,d): (a, d). Vector AD is from A(a,0) to D(0,d): (-a, d). Wait, but in a rectangle, vectors BC and AD should be equal? Wait, no. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and parallel. So vector AB equals vector DC, and vector BC equals vector AD. So vector AB is (a, 0). So vector DC should be same. Vector DC is from D(0,d) to C(a,d): (a, 0). Correct. Vector BC is from B(0,0) to C(a,d): (a, d). Vector AD is from A(a,0) to D(0,d): (-a, d). These two vectors are not equal. So something's wrong here. Maybe my coordinate setup is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming BD is vertical. Let me re-examine. Given that BA is perpendicular to BD. So BA is from B to A, and BD is from B to D. So BA · BD = 0. Let me denote coordinates properly. Let me take B at (0,0). Let me let BA be along x-axis, so A is at (a, 0). Let me let BD be along y-axis, so D is at (0, b). Then BA vector is (a, 0), BD vector is (0, b). Their dot product is zero, which satisfies the perpendicular condition. Now, since ABCD is a rectangle, the coordinates of C can be found. In a rectangle, the diagonals bisect each other. So midpoint of AC and BD should be the same. Coordinates of midpoint of BD: ((0 + 0)/2, (0 + b)/2) = (0, b/2). Midpoint of AC: [(a + x_C)/2, (0 + y_C)/2]. Setting equal to (0, b/2):

(a + x_C)/2 = 0 → x_C = -a

(0 + y_C)/2 = b/2 → y_C = b

Therefore, point C has coordinates (-a, b). Wait, but then BC is from B(0,0) to C(-a, b). And CD is from C(-a, b) to D(0, b). Then DA is from D(0,b) to A(a,0). Wait, but in that case, DA would go from (0,b) to (a,0). Is that consistent with being a rectangle?

Let me check the slopes. Slope of AB is 0 (horizontal). Slope of BC: from (0,0) to (-a, b): slope is (b - 0)/(-a - 0) = -b/a. Slope of CD: from (-a, b) to (0, b): slope is (b - b)/(0 - (-a)) = 0, so horizontal. Slope of DA: from (0,b) to (a,0): slope is (0 - b)/(a - 0) = -b/a. So AB is horizontal, BC has slope -b/a, CD is horizontal, DA has slope -b/a. Wait, but in a rectangle, adjacent sides should be perpendicular. However, AB is horizontal, BC has slope -b/a. For AB and BC to be perpendicular, their slopes' product should be -1. AB slope is 0, BC slope is undefined? No, AB is horizontal (slope 0), BC is going from B(0,0) to C(-a, b). Wait, the slope of BC is (change in y)/(change in x) = (b-0)/(-a - 0) = -b/a. So slope of AB is 0, slope of BC is -b/a. For them to be perpendicular, their product should be -1. 0 * (-b/a) = 0 ≠ -1. Which contradicts the fact that ABCD is a rectangle. Therefore, my coordinate assignment is wrong.

Hmm, so my assumption that BD is along y-axis might be invalid. Let me reconsider. The problem states that BA is perpendicular to BD. So BA and BD are perpendicular. But in a rectangle, BA and BC are adjacent sides and thus should be perpendicular. Wait, but BD is a diagonal, not a side. So BD is a diagonal from B to D. So in the rectangle, BA is one side, BD is a diagonal. So in a rectangle, the diagonal BD makes an angle with BA. Let me think about how to correctly model this.

Let me start over. Let me use variables without assigning specific coordinates yet. Since ABCD is a rectangle, all angles are 90 degrees. Let me note that angle at A is 90°, angle at B is 90°, etc. Now, the problem mentions angles 1 through 8. Let me see the given equalities:

MeasureOf(Angle(D, C, G)) = MeasureOf(angle 7)

Angle(D, C, G) is angle at point C between points D, C, G. So ∠DCG = angle 7.

Similarly, Angle(C, G, D) = angle 8. That's angle at G between C, G, D. So ∠CGD = angle 8.

Then, Angle(A, D, C) = angle 3. This is angle at D between A, D, C. So ∠ADC = angle 3.

Angle(D, G, B) = angle 5. So ∠DGB = angle 5.

Angle(C, A, D) = angle 1. So ∠CAD = angle 1. Given m∠1 = 38°.

Angle(G, B, D) = angle 4. So ∠GBD = angle 4.

Angle(G, A, B) = angle 2. So ∠GAB = angle 2.

Additionally, G lies on DA and BC. So G is the intersection of DA and BC. Wait, but in a rectangle, DA and BC are opposite sides, so they are parallel and won't meet unless extended. Hence, G must be a point where DA and BC are extended to meet. So G is outside the rectangle.

Moreover, BA is perpendicular to BD. So BA ⊥ BD. So in triangle ABD, BA is perpendicular to BD. Wait, but BD is a diagonal from B to D. So BA is one side, BD is another line from B. So triangle ABD has a right angle at B. Wait, but in a rectangle, BA and BD... Wait, BA is one side, BD is a diagonal. So in a rectangle, the diagonal BD creates a triangle ABD with BA and BD. Since BA is perpendicular to BD, that implies that triangle ABD is a right triangle at B. But in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other, but they are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, but here BA is perpendicular to BD, which is a diagonal. So this suggests that triangle ABD is a right triangle at B, making ABCD a rectangle with specific proportions.

So with BA perpendicular to BD, and ABCD being a rectangle, we can deduce more about the shape.

Let me try to draw this. Let me imagine rectangle ABCD with BA perpendicular to BD. So starting with point B. From B, BA is one side, and BD is the diagonal, forming a right angle. So BA is horizontal, BD is vertical. Then, point D is vertically above B. Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, point A is horizontally to the right of B, and point C is diagonally opposite. Wait, but if BD is a diagonal from B to D, then in the rectangle, the diagonal BD connects B to D. So in a rectangle, the diagonals are AC and BD. But if BA is perpendicular to BD, then in triangle ABD, right-angled at B, so BA is one leg, BD is another leg, and AD is hypotenuse. Wait, but in a rectangle, AD is a side, not the hypotenuse. Wait, in rectangle ABCD, AD is a side. Wait, if BA is perpendicular to BD, then BD is not a side but a diagonal. So in triangle ABD, right-angled at B. Thus, AD² = AB² + BD². But in a rectangle, AD is equal to BC, and AB is equal to CD. Also, the length of diagonal BD can be computed using Pythagoras if we know sides. But maybe this is getting too abstract. Let me try coordinates again with this information.

Let me place point B at (0,0). Since BA is horizontal, let me put point A at (a, 0). Since BA is perpendicular to BD, BD must be vertical. So point D is at (0, d) for some d. Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, point C can be found. In a rectangle, vector AB equals vector DC. Vector AB is (a, 0). So vector DC should also be (a, 0). Point D is at (0, d), so point C is D + vector AB: (0 + a, d + 0) = (a, d). Wait, but then BC would be from B(0,0) to C(a, d). But in a rectangle, BC should be equal to AD. AD is from A(a, 0) to D(0, d): vector (-a, d). So BC should be same as AD. Vector BC is from B(0,0) to C(a, d): (a, d). But vector AD is (-a, d). These are not equal unless a = 0, which would collapse the rectangle. Contradiction again. What's wrong here?

Ah, maybe I got the direction wrong. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and parallel. So AB equals DC, and AD equals BC. Vector AB is from A to B? No, AB is from A to B? Wait, no. AB is from A to B? Wait, in the rectangle ABCD, the order is A-B-C-D-A. So AB is from A to B, BC is from B to C, CD is from C to D, DA is from D to A. So vector AB is B - A, vector BC is C - B, etc.

If point A is at (a, 0), point B is at (0,0). Then vector AB is B - A = (0 - a, 0 - 0) = (-a, 0). Vector DC should be equal to AB. Point D is at (0, d), point C is at (x, y). Vector DC is C - D = (x - 0, y - d) = (x, y - d). This should equal AB vector (-a, 0). So x = -a, y - d = 0 → y = d. So point C is at (-a, d). Then, vector BC is C - B = (-a - 0, d - 0) = (-a, d). Vector AD is D - A = (0 - a, d - 0) = (-a, d). So yes, vector BC equals vector AD. Great, that works. So coordinates:

A(a, 0)
B(0, 0)
D(0, d)
C(-a, d)

Now, check the rectangle. Check if all angles are 90 degrees. Let's verify the slopes. 

Slope of AB: from A(a,0) to B(0,0): slope is (0 - 0)/(0 - a) = 0/-a = 0 (horizontal line).

Slope of BC: from B(0,0) to C(-a, d): slope is (d - 0)/(-a - 0) = -d/a.

Slope of CD: from C(-a, d) to D(0, d): slope is (d - d)/(0 - (-a)) = 0/a = 0 (horizontal line).

Slope of DA: from D(0, d) to A(a, 0): slope is (0 - d)/(a - 0) = -d/a.

Now, in a rectangle, adjacent sides should be perpendicular. So AB and BC should be perpendicular. AB has slope 0, BC has slope -d/a. Their product is 0 * (-d/a) = 0 ≠ -1. Wait, that's not perpendicular. There's a contradiction here. What's wrong?

Wait, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. But according to this, AB is horizontal, BC has slope -d/a. For them to be perpendicular, their slopes must multiply to -1. But 0 times anything is 0, not -1. So clearly something is wrong. Where is the error?

Ah! Here's the mistake: In my coordinate setup, BA is from B to A, which is (a, 0) to (0,0), so vector BA is (-a, 0). BD is from B(0,0) to D(0, d), so vector BD is (0, d). The problem states that BA is perpendicular to BD. The dot product of BA and BD vectors should be zero. 

Vector BA is from B to A: A - B = (a,0) - (0,0) = (a,0). Wait, earlier I thought it was (-a, 0), but actually, vector BA is from B to A, so it's A - B. If A is at (a,0), B at (0,0), then BA vector is (a, 0). Vector BD is D - B = (0, d) - (0,0) = (0, d). Dot product of BA and BD is (a)(0) + (0)(d) = 0. Yes, they are perpendicular. So that part is okay. 

But why are AB and BC not perpendicular? Because AB is from A to B, which is vector (-a, 0), while BC is from B to C, which is vector (-a, d). Wait, but in the rectangle, AB and BC are adjacent sides, so they should be perpendicular. But their slopes are AB slope is from A to B: (0 - 0)/(0 - a) = 0/-a = 0 (horizontal), and BC slope is from B to C: (d - 0)/(-a - 0) = d / (-a) = -d/a. For AB and BC to be perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. But AB slope is 0, so product is 0. Not possible. So this indicates inconsistency. Where is the error?

Wait, maybe I confused the vectors. The side AB is from A to B, which is vector (-a, 0). Side BC is from B to C, vector (-a, d). The dot product of AB and BC vectors should be zero for them to be perpendicular. Let's compute:

AB • BC = (-a)(-a) + (0)(d) = a² + 0 = a² ≠ 0. So they are not perpendicular. Which contradicts the property of a rectangle. So something is very wrong here. How come?

This suggests that my coordinate setup is flawed. Perhaps because I forced BA to be perpendicular to BD, which may conflict with the rectangle's properties. Let me think differently. Let me consider that in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other, but they are not necessarily perpendicular. However, in this problem, BA is perpendicular to BD. So BD is a diagonal, and BA is a side, and they are perpendicular. This seems like a special case.

Maybe the rectangle is not a square, and the sides have specific lengths. Let me try to calculate. Let me assume BA is of length 'a', BD is of length 'b'. Since BA ⊥ BD, triangle ABD is a right triangle with legs BA and BD, and hypotenuse AD. So AD² = BA² + BD². But in a rectangle, AD is a side, equal to BC. Also, AB is equal to CD. 

But how does this relate to the rest? Let me attempt to express coordinates with this.

Let me place point B at (0,0). Let me let BA be along x-axis, so point A is at (a, 0). Since BA ⊥ BD, BD is along y-axis, so point D is at (0, b). Now, in the rectangle, point C can be found. Since ABCD is a rectangle, vector AB = vector DC. Vector AB is from A to B: (-a, 0). So vector DC should also be (-a, 0). Point D is at (0, b), so point C is D + vector DC = (0 - a, b + 0) = (-a, b). Now, check if BC is equal to AD. Vector BC is from B(0,0) to C(-a, b): (-a, b). Vector AD is from A(a,0) to D(0, b): (-a, b). Yes, they are equal. So that works. Now, check if adjacent sides are perpendicular. For example, AB and BC. Vector AB is from A to B: (-a, 0). Vector BC is from B to C: (-a, b). Their dot product is (-a)(-a) + (0)(b) = a² + 0 = a² ≠ 0. So they are not perpendicular. Which violates the rectangle property. So what's wrong here?

Wait, but in a rectangle, AB and BC are adjacent sides and should be perpendicular. Why are they not perpendicular in this setup? It must mean that my assumption that BD is along y-axis is conflicting with the rectangle's properties. So there must be another constraint. 

Wait, maybe I need to ensure that BA is perpendicular to BD, and that AB is perpendicular to BC. Let me write equations for that. 

Given BA is from B(0,0) to A(a,0), so vector BA is (a,0). BD is from B(0,0) to D(x,y), so vector BD is (x,y). They are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero: a*x + 0*y = ax = 0 ⇒ x = 0. So BD must be along y-axis. So D is at (0, d). Then, as before, point C is at (-a, d). Now, vector BC is from B(0,0) to C(-a, d): (-a, d). For AB and BC to be perpendicular, their dot product should be zero. Vector AB is from A to B: (-a, 0). Vector BC is (-a, d). Dot product: (-a)(-a) + (0)(d) = a² ≠ 0. Still not zero. So this is impossible. 

This suggests that it's impossible for BA to be perpendicular to BD and for ABCD to be a rectangle, unless a = 0, which collapses the rectangle. Contradiction. So where is the error in reasoning?

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the notation. The problem says "Perpendicular(Line(B, A), Line(B, D))". So line BA is perpendicular to line BD. But line BA is the infinite line passing through B and A, and line BD is the infinite line passing through B and D. So they are perpendicular at point B. So in this case, BA and BD are two lines meeting at B and perpendicular. But in a rectangle, BA is one side, and BD is a diagonal. So in this scenario, the diagonal BD is perpendicular to side BA. This would imply that the rectangle has certain proportions. Let me try to find relations between sides.

In the rectangle, let AB = length a, and let BD = length c. Since BA ⊥ BD, triangle ABD is right-angled at B. So by Pythagoras: AD² = AB² + BD². But AD is also a side of the rectangle. Wait, in a rectangle, AD is equal to BC, and AB is equal to CD. But AD is also the diagonal? No, AD is a side. Wait, no. In rectangle ABCD, AD is a side, connecting A to D. Wait, if AB is one side, and AD is another side, then they are perpendicular. But in our case, BD is the diagonal, which is perpendicular to BA. So in triangle ABD, right-angled at B, with legs BA and BD, and hypotenuse AD. So AD² = AB² + BD². But in the rectangle, AD is a side, and AB is another side. Let me denote AB = a, BD = c, AD = b. Then, b² = a² + c². But in a rectangle, the length of the diagonal AC can be calculated as sqrt(a² + b²). Wait, no. Wait, if AB and AD are sides of the rectangle, then diagonal AC would be sqrt(AB² + AD²). But here, BD is a diagonal, so its length is sqrt(AB² + AD²). Wait, but in our case, BD is a diagonal, and it is perpendicular to BA. So BD is a diagonal that is perpendicular to side BA. This seems like a special case.

Let me try to assign values to satisfy this. Suppose AB = 1, and BD = 1. Then AD² = 1² + 1² = 2 ⇒ AD = √2. So in this case, the rectangle has sides AB = 1, AD = √2. Then, the other sides BC = AD = √2, and CD = AB = 1. But then, the diagonal AC would be sqrt(AB² + AD²) = sqrt(1 + 2) = √3. But BD is another diagonal, which is also sqrt(AB² + AD²) = √3. Wait, but in this case, BD is supposed to be length 1, but according to the calculation, it should be √3. Contradiction. So this suggests that my previous assumption is wrong. 

Wait, no. If BD is a diagonal, then its length should be equal to the diagonal of the rectangle, which is sqrt(AB² + AD²). But in this case, we're saying that BD is perpendicular to BA, which implies that in triangle ABD, right-angled at B, so BD is one leg, BA is another leg, and AD is hypotenuse. But in the rectangle, AD is a side, not a diagonal. So this implies that the diagonal of the rectangle is AD, which is the hypotenuse of triangle ABD. But in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and connect opposite corners. So if AD is a diagonal, then it should connect A to D, which in a rectangle, it would normally be a side. Wait, confusion arises from labeling of points. Let me clarify:

In rectangle ABCD, the vertices are ordered such that AB, BC, CD, DA are consecutive sides. So AD is a side, connecting A to D. The diagonals are AC and BD. So if BD is a diagonal, then it connects B to D. In this case, if BA is perpendicular to BD, then in triangle ABD, right-angled at B, with BA and BD as legs, and AD as hypotenuse. So AD is a diagonal of the rectangle, which in a rectangle is usually equal to sqrt(AB² + AD²)? Wait, no. Wait, if AD is a side, then the diagonal AC would be sqrt(AB² + AD²). But here, BD is the diagonal, so its length should also be sqrt(AB² + AD²). But in this case, BD is a leg of the right triangle ABD, so its length is sqrt(AB² + BD²)? No, wait, in triangle ABD, right-angled at B, the hypotenuse is AD, so AD = sqrt(BA² + BD²). But in the rectangle, the diagonal BD should also be equal to the other diagonal AC. So AC = BD = sqrt(AB² + AD²). But from triangle ABD, we have AD = sqrt(BA² + BD²). Substituting into diagonal length: BD = sqrt(AB² + AD²) = sqrt(AB² + (BA² + BD²)) => BD = sqrt(2BA² + BD²). Squaring both sides: BD² = 2BA² + BD² ⇒ 0 = 2BA² ⇒ BA = 0, which is impossible. So this leads to a contradiction. 

This suggests that there is no such rectangle where BA is perpendicular to BD. But the problem statement says that such a configuration exists. So I must have made a fundamental error in understanding the diagram. Let me try a different approach.

Perhaps the key is to focus on the angles mentioned, rather than trying to assign coordinates. Let me list all the given angle equalities:

1. ∠DCG = angle 7
2. ∠CGD = angle 8
3. ∠ADC = angle 3
4. ∠DGB = angle 5
5. ∠CAD = angle 1 (given as 38°)
6. ∠GBD = angle 4
7. ∠GAB = angle 2 (to find)

Since ABCD is a rectangle, ∠ADC is a right angle (since all angles in a rectangle are 90°). So ∠ADC = 90°, so angle 3 is 90°. But wait, the problem says that ∠ADC = angle 3, so angle 3 is 90°. But angle 1 is given as 38°, which is ∠CAD. Let me try to find relationships between these angles.

∠CAD is angle at A between CA and DA. Wait, point G is on DA and BC. Let me try to visualize this. Since G is on DA and BC, and ABCD is a rectangle, DA is one side, BC is the opposite side. Extending DA and BC to meet at G. So G is outside the rectangle, forming a triangle or something.

With BA perpendicular to BD, so BA ⊥ BD. Let me think about triangles involving G.

Let me consider triangle GAB. We have ∠GAB = angle 2, which is what we need to find. Also, ∠GBD = angle 4, and ∠DGB = angle 5.

Also, ∠CAD = angle 1 = 38°. Let me try to find relations.

Since ABCD is a rectangle, DA is parallel to BC. Since G is on DA and BC, then DG is a segment of DA extended, and BG is a segment of BC extended. So lines DA and BC meet at G.

Now, considering triangle DGC: ∠DCG = angle 7, ∠CGD = angle 8, and ∠DGC is supplementary to ∠DGB if they are on a straight line. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, since DA || BC, and G is their intersection, then maybe alternate interior angles or something.

Also, since BA ⊥ BD, and G is on DA and BC, perhaps we can find some similar triangles or use trigonometric relationships.

Let me focus on ∠CAD = 38°. ∠CAD is the angle at A between CA and DA. Since DA is a side of the rectangle, and CA is a diagonal from C to A. Let me think about triangle CAD. In rectangle ABCD, CA is a diagonal. So in triangle CAD, we have angle at A is 38°, angle at D is 90° (since ADC is 90°), so we can find other angles.

Wait, in triangle CAD, angles sum to 180°. ∠CAD = 38°, ∠ADC = 90°, so ∠ACD = 180 - 38 - 90 = 52°. So ∠ACD = 52°. But ∠ACD is the angle at C between A, C, D. But in the problem, ∠DCG = angle 7. If G is on BC extended, then ∠DCG would be related to ∠ACD? Let me see.

Point G is on BC extended. Let me imagine extending BC beyond C to G. Wait, or extending DA and BC to meet at G. Depending on the position of G, it could be on either extension. Let me assume that G is on the extension of DA beyond A and BC beyond C, or vice versa. 

Assuming G is the intersection of DA extended and BC extended. Let me assume that G is such that DA is extended beyond A to G, and BC is extended beyond C to G. Or maybe DA is extended beyond D and BC extended beyond B? Need to determine based on the perpendicularity.

But since BA is perpendicular to BD, and BD is a diagonal, which would extend from B to D. If G is on DA and BC, it depends on the exact location. Let me try to consider triangle ABD, where BA ⊥ BD. If G is on DA and BC, perhaps it's located such that lines BG and DG form certain angles.

Alternatively, since ∠CAD = 38°, and in triangle CAD, we found ∠ACD = 52°, which might relate to angle 7 or 8.

But let me try to proceed. In triangle CAD, ∠ACD = 52°, which is the angle at C between A, C, D. Now, if G is on BC, then line CG is part of BC extended. So ∠DCG would be the angle at C between D, C, G. If G is on BC extended beyond C, then ∠DCG would be supplementary to ∠ACD? Let me visualize: if you extend BC beyond C to G, then at point C, the angle between DC and CG would be a straight line minus ∠ACD. Wait, DC is one side of the rectangle, and CG is the extension of BC. So at point C, the angle between DC and CG would be 180° - ∠BCD. But ∠BCD is 90°, since it's a rectangle. So ∠DCG = 180° - 90° = 90°? No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, at point C, DC is one side of the rectangle (from D to C), and CG is the extension of BC. So the angle between DC and CG would depend on the direction of extension. If G is on BC extended beyond C, then from point C, DC goes to D, and CG goes to G. So the angle between DC and CG is the same as the angle between DC and CB extended, which is 180° - ∠DCB. Since ∠DCB is 90°, then ∠DCG = 180° - 90° = 90°. So ∠DCG = 90°, which would mean angle 7 is 90°. But I'm not sure if this is correct.

Alternatively, if G is on the other side, like extending DA beyond D and BC beyond B, then ∠DCG would be different. This is getting confusing without a diagram. Let me try to find another way.

Given that ∠CAD = 38°, and in triangle CAD, ∠ACD = 52°, as previously calculated. Now, if G is on BC, then line CG is part of BC. Let me consider triangle CGD. In this triangle, we have ∠DCG = angle 7, ∠CGD = angle 8, and ∠CDG = ? Let me see. At point D, we have ∠CDG. Since G is on DA, ∠CDG is part of the angle at D. In the rectangle, ∠ADC is 90°, so ∠CDG would be part of that. If G is on DA extended, then ∠CDG is the same as ∠ADC if G is on DA. Wait, if G is on DA, then line DG is part of DA, so ∠CDG is the same as ∠ADC, which is 90°. But that would mean ∠CDG = 90°, so in triangle CGD, angles would be ∠DCG = 7, ∠CGD = 8, and ∠CDG = 90°. So 7 + 8 + 90 = 180 → 7 + 8 = 90. So angle 7 + angle 8 = 90°. 

But I don't know if that helps directly. However, if I can find relations between these angles and others, perhaps via other given equalities.

Also, given that ∠DGB = angle 5. So in triangle DGB, ∠DGB = angle 5. Also, ∠GBD = angle 4, and ∠GDB = ?

Wait, in triangle DGB, angles are ∠DGB = 5, ∠GBD = 4, and ∠GDB = ?. Sum to 180°. So 5 + 4 + ∠GDB = 180 → ∠GDB = 171° - 5 - 4 = 171 - 9 = 162°? Wait, no: 180 - (5 + 4) = 180 - 9 = 171°. So ∠GDB = 171°. But that seems very large. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe I should look at other triangles. Let me consider triangle GAB. We know ∠GAB = angle 2, which we need to find. Also, ∠GBD = angle 4, and possibly other angles.

Since BA is perpendicular to BD, and G is on DA and BC, perhaps there are similar triangles or right triangles involved.

Let me try to find relationships using the given angle 1 = 38°. As earlier, in triangle CAD, ∠CAD = 38°, ∠ADC = 90°, so ∠ACD = 52°. If ∠ACD = 52°, and if ∠DCG is part of this, depending on where G is.

Assume G is on BC extended beyond C. Then, ∠DCG is the angle at C between D, C, G. Since DC is a side of the rectangle, and CG is the extension of BC. So ∠DCG = 180° - ∠BCD. But ∠BCD is 90°, so ∠DCG = 180 - 90 = 90°. So angle 7 = 90°. But this might not help directly.

Alternatively, if G is on the other side, say extending DA beyond A and BC beyond B. Let me try that. If G is on DA extended beyond A and BC extended beyond B, then line CG would pass through G. Let me consider triangle DGA and others.

Alternatively, let me think about the entire figure and the given angles. Since we need to find angle 2, which is ∠GAB. Let me try to relate this to other known angles.

From the earlier analysis, in triangle CAD, ∠ACD = 52°. If G is on BC extended, then line CG passes through G, and ∠ACD is part of ∠DCG. If G is on BC extended beyond C, then ∠DCG = ∠ACD + something? Or is it?

Wait, if G is on BC extended beyond C, then from point C, line CG is in the direction away from B. At point C, the angle between DC and CG would be ∠DCG. Since DC is from D to C, and CG is from C to G. In the rectangle, DC is one side, and BC is another side. If G is on BC extended beyond C, then CG is colinear with BC. So at point C, DC is one side (from D to C), and CG is the extension of BC (from C to G). So the angle between DC and CG is the same as the angle between DC and BC, which is 90°, because in the rectangle, DC is perpendicular to BC. Wait, no: in the rectangle, DC is perpendicular to BC? Let me confirm.

In rectangle ABCD, sides DC and BC are adjacent sides at point C. So they are perpendicular. Yes, because all angles in a rectangle are 90°. So at point C, DC and BC are perpendicular. So if G is on BC extended beyond C, then the angle between DC and CG is still 90°, since CG is along BC extended. So ∠DCG = 90°, which would make angle 7 = 90°. 

If that's the case, then in triangle CGD, angles are ∠DCG = 90°, ∠CGD = angle 8, and ∠CDG = ?. At point D, ∠CDG is the angle between CD and DG. Since G is on DA extended, DG is part of DA. In the rectangle, DA is perpendicular to DC (since it's a rectangle), so ∠CDG is 90°, because DA is perpendicular to DC. Wait, DA is perpendicular to DC? No, DA is one side of the rectangle, DC is another side. In a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So at point D, DC and DA are perpendicular. So ∠ADC is 90°, which is between DC and DA. If G is on DA extended, then DG is along DA, so ∠CDG is the same as ∠ADC, which is 90°. So in triangle CGD, angles are 90°, angle 8, and 90°, which would sum to 180° only if angle 8 is 0°, which is impossible. So this suggests a contradiction, implying that G is not on BC extended beyond C.

Therefore, G must be on the other side, such that DA and BC meet at G when extended in the other direction. Let me assume G is on the extension of DA beyond D and BC extended beyond B. Let me try this.

If G is on DA extended beyond D, and on BC extended beyond B, then line DG is part of DA extended, and line BG is part of BC extended. Now, at point D, ∠CDG is the angle between CD and DG. Since DG is DA extended beyond D, and CD is one side of the rectangle. In the rectangle, DA is perpendicular to DC, so ∠CDG is 90°. Similarly, at point C, ∠DCG is the angle between DC and CG. Since CG is part of BC extended beyond B, but G is on BC extended beyond B. Wait, if G is on BC extended beyond B, then CG would be from C to B to G. So at point C, the angle between DC and CG is the same as the angle between DC and CB, which is 90°, because DC is perpendicular to CB. So ∠DCG = 90°, making angle 7 = 90°. Again, leading to triangle CGD having two right angles, which is impossible. So this suggests that G is not on these extensions either.

Wait, maybe G is on DA extended beyond A and BC extended beyond C. Let me try this. So G is where DA extended beyond A meets BC extended beyond C. In this case, at point C, ∠DCG is the angle between DC and CG. Since CG is part of BC extended beyond C, which is the same as BC, so ∠DCG is the same as ∠DCB, which is 90°, as before. At point D, ∠CDG is the angle between CD and DG. Since DG is DA extended beyond A, and DA is perpendicular to CD, so ∠CDG is 90°. Again, triangle CGD would have two right angles, which is impossible. 

This suggests that my assumptions about the location of G are incorrect. Perhaps G is inside the rectangle? But since G is on DA and BC, which are opposite sides of the rectangle, they don't intersect inside the rectangle. So G must be outside. But all extensions lead to contradictions in the triangle angles. 

Maybe I need to revisit the initial assumption that ∠ADC = 90°. Wait, in the rectangle, all angles are 90°, so ∠ADC is indeed 90°. But if G is on DA and BC, then ∠ADC is part of the larger picture. Let me consider triangle DGC. If ∠DCG = angle 7, ∠CGD = angle 8, and ∠CDG = ?, and if ∠CDG is not 90°, then maybe it's something else. 

Wait, if G is on DA and BC, then line DG is part of DA, and line CG is part of BC. So at point D, ∠CDG is the angle between CD and DG. Since DG is along DA, and CD is perpendicular to DA (because it's a rectangle), so ∠CDG is 90°. Similarly, at point C, ∠DCG is the angle between DC and CG, which is 90°, as before. This suggests that triangle CGD has two right angles, which is impossible, so this implies that my understanding is wrong.

Wait, but maybe G is not on the sides DA and BC, but on their extensions such that DA and BC are not extended in the ways I thought. Let me think: if DA and BC are extended in such a way that G is where they meet, but not in the directions I assumed. For example, if DA is extended beyond A and BC is extended beyond B, then G is at their intersection. In this case, let's analyze.

Let me consider DA extended beyond A to G, and BC extended beyond B to G. So G is outside the rectangle, on the extension of DA beyond A and BC beyond B. Now, at point D, ∠CDG is the angle between CD and DG. Since DG is along DA extended beyond A, and CD is perpendicular to DA (as it's a rectangle), so ∠CDG is 90°. At point C, ∠DCG is the angle between DC and CG. Since CG is the extension of BC beyond B, and DC is perpendicular to BC (since it's a rectangle), so ∠DCG is 90°. So again, triangle CGD has two right angles, which is impossible. 

This suggests that there is a flaw in my understanding. Perhaps the problem is not a standard rectangle, but a different quadrilateral? No, the problem states it is a rectangle. 

Wait, perhaps the key is that BA is perpendicular to BD, and this affects the angles. Let me try to use this. Since BA ⊥ BD, and G is on DA and BC, maybe we can find some relationship.

Let me consider triangle ABD, right-angled at B. If G is on DA and BC, then perhaps there is a relation between triangles ABD and GBD or something.

Alternatively, let me focus on angle 1 = 38°, which is ∠CAD. In triangle CAD, as before, ∠CAD = 38°, ∠ADC = 90°, so ∠ACD = 52°. Now, if G is on BC, then line CG passes through G. Let me consider line CG. If I can find some relationship between ∠ACD and ∠DCG, it might help. 

Suppose G is on BC such that CG is a line from C to G. If G is on BC, then ∠DCG is part of the angle at C. But in the rectangle, at point C, the angle between DC and BC is 90°. If G is on BC extended, then ∠DCG would be 90°, as before. But this leads to the earlier contradiction.

Wait, but perhaps G is not on BC extended, but on BC itself? But since G is on DA and BC, and DA and BC are opposite sides of the rectangle, G must be at their intersection, which only happens if the rectangle is degenerate, which it isn't. 

At this point, I'm stuck with the geometric configuration. Maybe I should abandon coordinate geometry and focus on angle chasing with the given equalities.

Given that ∠CAD = 38° (angle 1), and in triangle CAD, ∠ACD = 52°, as established. Now, let's consider that ∠DCG = angle 7. If G is on BC, then ∠DCG is part of ∠ACD or extends from it. If G is on BC extended beyond C, then ∠DCG is supplementary to ∠ACD. Let me explain: at point C, ∠ACD is 52°, and if G is on BC extended beyond C, then ∠DCG = 180° - ∠ACD = 180 - 52 = 128°, so angle 7 = 128°. But this is just a guess.

Alternatively, if G is on BC extended beyond B, then ∠DCG would be ∠ACD + ∠ACB. Wait, ∠ACB is part of the rectangle? No, in the rectangle, ∠BCD is 90°, and ∠ACB is part of triangle ABC. Let me think.

Alternatively, let me consider that line CG passes through G, and since G is on DA and BC, maybe there are similar triangles or some transversal.

Another approach: since BA ⊥ BD, and G is on DA and BC, maybe triangle BAG is related to other triangles.

Let me try to find angle 2, which is ∠GAB. Let me consider triangle GAB. In this triangle, we know ∠GAB = angle 2, and we might find other angles if we can relate them to known quantities.

Also, from the given, ∠GBD = angle 4, and ∠DGB = angle 5. So in triangle DGB, we have ∠GBD = 4, ∠DGB = 5, and ∠GDB = 180 - 4 - 5 = 171°. But this seems unlikely, suggesting that maybe there's a relationship between these angles and others.

But I'm not making progress. Let me try to use the fact that in triangle CAD, ∠ACD = 52°, and if ∠DCG = angle 7, then maybe angle 7 is related to this 52°. If G is on BC, then ∠DCG could be 52°, making angle 7 = 52°. But how?

If G is on BC such that CG is parallel to AD, then ∠DCG would be equal to ∠DAC = 38°, but this is speculative.

Alternatively, since BA ⊥ BD, and G is on DA and BC, let me consider triangle BAG and triangle BDG.

Wait, let me try to use the fact that BA ⊥ BD. Let me consider triangle ABD, right-angled at B. If G is on DA and BC, then perhaps BG is some line, and we can use similar triangles.

Let me assume that G is the intersection of DA and BC extended. Let me denote the intersection as G. Now, since BA ⊥ BD, and G is on DA and BC, maybe there are some right triangles here.

Let me consider triangle BGD. We know ∠GBD = angle 4, and ∠DGB = angle 5. Also, ∠GDB is part of the triangle. Let me try to relate this to other angles.

If I can find a relationship between angle 4 and angle 5, and angle 2, which is ∠GAB, perhaps through triangle AGB.

Let me consider triangle AGB. It has ∠GAB = angle 2, ∠ABG = ?, and ∠AGB = ?. If I can find these angles, I can find angle 2.

But to do this, I need to relate them to other parts of the diagram. Let me think about line BD. Since BA ⊥ BD, and G is on DA and BC, maybe there is a right angle somewhere.

Let me try to summarize what I know:

- ABCD is a rectangle, so all angles are 90°.
- ∠CAD = 38° (angle 1).
- ∠ACD = 52° (from triangle CAD).
- ∠DCG = angle 7.
- ∠CGD = angle 8.
- ∠DGB = angle 5.
- ∠GBD = angle 4.
- ∠GAB = angle 2 (to find).

If I can find a relationship between these angles, perhaps through triangle CGD or others.

Let me assume that ∠DCG = 52° (same as ∠ACD), making angle 7 = 52°. Then, in triangle CGD, we have ∠DCG = 52°, ∠CGD = angle 8, and ∠CDG = ?. At point D, ∠CDG is the angle between CD and DG. Since G is on DA, ∠CDG is 90°, as CD is perpendicular to DA. So in triangle CGD, angles are 52°, 90°, and angle 8. So 52 + 90 + angle 8 = 180 → angle 8 = 38°. So angle 8 = 38°. 

Now, looking at ∠DGB = angle 5. Let me consider triangle DGB. It has ∠GBD = angle 4, ∠DGB = angle 5, and ∠GDB = ?. If I can find ∠GDB, which is part of the angle at D. Since ∠CDG is 90°, and ∠GDB is part of it, if G is on DA, then ∠GDB is the same as ∠CDG, which is 90°. Wait, no. ∠GDB is the angle at D between G and B. Since G is on DA, and B is a vertex, this angle would be part of the angle at D. If G is on DA extended, then ∠GDB is the same as ∠ADB, which is part of the diagonal BD.

Wait, let me think. Point D is connected to G (on DA extended) and to B. So ∠GDB is the angle at D between G and B. Since G is on DA extended, and B is a corner of the rectangle, this angle is part of the triangle DGB. 

If ∠GDB is part of triangle DGB, and we have from earlier that in triangle CGD, ∠CDG = 90°, and ∠DCG = 52°, ∠CGD = 38°. Now, if I can relate ∠GDB to other angles.

But I'm not seeing it. Let me try to use the fact that in triangle DGB, ∠GDB + ∠GBD + ∠DGB = 180. If I can find ∠GDB, which is ∠GDB = ?

If G is on DA extended, then line DB is a diagonal, and line DG is part of DA. So ∠GDB is the angle between DB and DA at point D. In the rectangle, DA is perpendicular to DC, and DB is a diagonal. So the angle between DA and DB is ∠ADB. Let me calculate this angle.

In the rectangle, let's consider triangle ABD, right-angled at B. So ∠ABD = 90°, and ∠BAD is the angle at A. Wait, in triangle ABD, right-angled at B, ∠ABD = 9 0°, ∠BAD is the angle at A, and ∠ADB is the angle at D. Using trigonometry, tan(∠BAD) = opposite/adjacent = BD/AB. But without specific lengths, it's hard to calculate. However, if I can relate this to other angles.

But if ∠GDB is the same as ∠ADB, then in triangle DGB, ∠GDB = ∠ADB. Let me call this angle x. Then, in triangle DGB, x + angle 4 + angle 5 = 180. If I can find x, I can relate it to other angles.

But how?

Alternatively, since ∠GAB = angle 2, and ∠GBD = angle 4, and ∠DGB = angle 5, maybe there is a relationship between these angles and angle 2. Let me consider triangle AGB. In this triangle, ∠GAB = angle 2, ∠ABG = ?, and ∠AGB = ?. If I can find these angles, I can find angle 2.

But ∠ABG is part of ∠ABD, which is 90°, since BA ⊥ BD. So ∠ABG = 90° - ∠GBD = 90° - angle 4. 

In triangle AGB, angles are angle 2, 90° - angle 4, and ∠AGB. So angle 2 + (90° - angle 4) + ∠AGB = 180°. Thus, ∠AGB = 90° + angle 4 - angle 2.

But ∠AGB is also part of other triangles. For example, ∠AGB is the same as ∠DGB if G is on the same line, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if I can relate ∠AGB to other angles. Let me think about line GB. It is part of the diagonal BD extended? No, because G is on DA and BC, and BD is a diagonal from B to D. So line GB is part of the line from G to B, which is part of BC extended.

Wait, if G is on BC extended, then line GB is part of BC. So ∠AGB is the angle at G between A and B. But I'm not sure.

This is getting too abstract. Let me try to use the earlier assumption where ∠DCG = 52°, leading to angle 7 = 52°, and angle 8 = 38°. If angle 8 is 38°, and angle 5 is part of triangle DGB, maybe there's a relationship.

If angle 8 is 38°, and angle 5 is part of triangle DGB, which has angles angle 4, angle 5, and angle GDB. If I can find angle GDB, which is ∠GDB = ?

If I assume that ∠GDB is the same as ∠ADB, which in triangle ABD is some value. Let me call ∠ADB = x. Then, in triangle DGB, x + angle 4 + angle 5 = 180. If I can find x, I can relate it to other angles.

But how to find x? In triangle ABD, right-angled at B, ∠ABD = 90°, ∠BAD = let's say α, and ∠ADB = x. So α + x = 90°. Also, tan(α) = BD/AB. But without specific lengths, I cannot determine numerical values. However, if I can relate α to other angles.

But earlier, we had ∠CAD = 38°, which is ∠BAD. Wait, ∠CAD is the angle at A between CA and DA. In the rectangle, CA is a diagonal from C to A. So ∠CAD is the angle between CA and DA. In triangle CAD, we found this angle to be 38°, and ∠ACD = 52°. 

If ∠BAD is the same as ∠CAD, then α = 38°. So in triangle ABD, α = 38°, so x = 90° - α = 52°. So ∠ADB = 52°. 

Thus, in triangle DGB, x = 52°, so 52 + angle 4 + angle 5 = 180 → angle 4 + angle 5 = 128°. 

Now, if angle 8 is 38°, and angle 5 is part of this, but how?

Earlier, in triangle CGD, we had angle 8 = 38°, which is ∠CGD. Now, ∠CGD is the same as ∠DGB if G is on the same line. Wait, ∠CGD is at G between C and D, and ∠DGB is at G between D and B. Are these angles related?

Yes, if points C, G, B are collinear, then ∠CGD and ∠DGB are supplementary. Because at point G, the angle between C-G and D-G is ∠CGD, and the angle between D-G and B-G is ∠DGB. If C, G, B are collinear, then ∠CGD + ∠DGB = 180°. 

So if ∠CGD = angle 8 = 38°, then ∠DGB = 180 - 38 = 142°. But earlier, in triangle DGB, we had angle 4 + angle 5 = 128°, and ∠DGB = angle 5 = 142°, which would mean angle 4 = 128 - 142 = -14°, which is impossible. So this suggests a contradiction, indicating an error in assumptions.

However, if instead, ∠DGB = angle 5 = 38°, then ∠CGD = 180 - 38 = 142°, which would make angle 8 = 142°. But earlier, in triangle CGD, we had angle 8 = 38°, which would be inconsistent. 

This suggests that my assumption that ∠DCG = 52° is incorrect. Let me backtrack.

If ∠DCG is not 52°, but something else. Let me try to find ∠DCG in terms of other angles. 

Since ∠ACD = 52°, and if G is on BC, then ∠DCG = ∠ACD + ∠ACG or something. But without knowing where G is, it's hard to say. 

Let me consider that line CG passes through G, and since G is on BC, then ∠ACG is part of ∠ACD. If G is on BC extended beyond C, then ∠ACG = ∠ACD + ∠DCG. Wait, no. If G is on BC extended beyond C, then ∠ACG is the angle at C between A, C, G. Since CG is part of BC extended, and AC is a diagonal, this angle would be ∠ACD + something.

Alternatively, if G is on BC extended beyond C, then ∠ACG = ∠ACD + ∠DCG. But I'm not sure.

At this point, I realize I need a different strategy. Let me recall that in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other. Also, since BA ⊥ BD, and G is on DA and BC, perhaps there are some right triangles or similar triangles.

Let me try to use the given angle 1 = 38°, and the fact that ∠CAD = 38°, and in triangle CAD, ∠ACD = 52°. Let me assume that ∠ACD is equal to angle 7, which is ∠DCG. If that's the case, then angle 7 = 52°. Then, in triangle CGD, ∠DCG = 52°, ∠CDG = 90°, so ∠CGD = 180 - 52 - 90 = 38°, which makes angle 8 = 38°.

Now, if ∠CGD = 38°, and this is the same as ∠DGB, since G is on line CB, then ∠DGB = 38°, which is angle 5. So angle 5 = 38°. 

Now, in triangle DGB, we have ∠GBD = angle 4, ∠DGB = 38°, and ∠GDB = 180 - 4 - 38 = 142°. 

But ∠GDB is the angle at D between G and B. In the rectangle, this angle is part of the diagonal BD. Earlier, we found that ∠ADB = 52°, which is the angle at D between A and B. If G is on DA extended, then ∠GDB is the same as ∠ADB, which is 52°, but here we have ∠GDB = 142°, which is a contradiction. 

This suggests that my assumption is wrong. However, if ∠GDB is 142°, then it implies that G is not on DA extended in the direction I thought, but in the other direction. Let me consider that G is on DA extended beyond D, so that ∠GDB is an external angle. In this case, ∠GDB would be 180° - ∠ADB = 180 - 52 = 128°. But in triangle DGB, ∠GDB = 128°, so 128 + angle 4 + 38 = 180 → angle 4 = 180 - 128 - 38 = 14°. 

Now, if angle 4 = 14°, and we need to find angle 2, which is ∠GAB. Let me consider triangle AGB. In this triangle, ∠GAB = angle 2, ∠ABG = 90° - angle 4 = 90 - 14 = 76°, and ∠AGB = 180 - angle 2 - 76 = 104 - angle 2. 

But ∠AGB is also part of other triangles. If G is on DA extended beyond D, then line AG is part of DA extended, and line BG is part of BC extended. Let me consider triangle AGB. If I can relate ∠AGB to other angles.

Alternatively, since BA is perpendicular to BD, and G is on DA and BC, maybe there is a relationship between ∠AGB and ∠GBD.

But I'm not making progress. Let me try to use the fact that in triangle ABD, right-angled at B, ∠ABD = 90°, ∠BAD = 38°, and ∠ADB = 52°. If G is on DA extended beyond D, then line BG forms some angle with BA. Let me consider triangle AGB. 

In triangle AGB, we have ∠ABG =
