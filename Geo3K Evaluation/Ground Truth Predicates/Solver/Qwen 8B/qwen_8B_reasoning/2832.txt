MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we need to find the measure of angle 3, which is denoted as ∠ACB. Let me start by jotting down all the given information and see how they connect.

First, the problem mentions several angles with specific measures:

1. Angle at point C, between points D, C, A (so ∠DCA) is 38 degrees.
2. Angle at point D, between points B, D, C (∠BDC) is equal to angle 1.
3. Angle at point A, between points C, A, B (∠CAB) is equal to angle 3.
4. Angle at point C, between points A, C, B (∠ACB) is 72 degrees.
5. Angle at point A, between points D, A, C (∠DAC) is 42 degrees.
6. Angle at point B, between points C, B, D (∠CBD) is equal to angle 2.
7. Point B lies on line AD.

Wait, hold on. Let me parse each of these again carefully because sometimes notation can be confusing.

The first constraint says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C, D, A)), 38). The angle at point D between points C and A? Wait, no—the standard notation for angle ABC is the angle at point B between points A and C. So Angle(C, D, A) would be the angle at point D between points C and A. So that's ∠CDA. Wait, but maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me confirm:

In general, Angle(X, Y, Z) refers to the angle at point Y between points X and Z. So Angle(C, D, A) is the angle at D formed by points C, D, A. So that's ∠CDA. Similarly, Angle(D, B, C) is the angle at B between D and C, so ∠DBC. Then Angle(A, C, B) is angle at C between A and B, which is ∠ACB. And Angle(C, B, A) is angle at B between C and A, which is ∠CBA. Wait, but the fourth constraint says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C, B, A)), 72), so that's ∠CBA = 72°. 

Also, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D, A, C)), 42). That's angle at A between D and C, so ∠DAC = 42°. 

So summarizing the given angles:

- ∠CDA = 38°
- ∠DBC = angle1
- ∠ACB = angle3 (Wait, no. Wait, original statement: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A, C, B)), MeasureOf(angle 3)). So Angle(A, C, B) is angle at C between A and B, which is ∠ACB. Therefore, ∠ACB = angle3. But wait, another constraint says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C, B, A)), 72). Which is angle at B between C and A, so ∠CBA = 72°. 

So we have:

∠CDA = 38°, ∠DBC = angle1, ∠ACB = angle3, ∠CBA = 72°, ∠DAC = 42°, ∠CBD = angle2. Also, point B lies on line AD. 

So, perhaps there's a diagram here that isn't provided, but we can reconstruct it based on the constraints.

Let me try to sketch mentally. Points A, D, and B are involved since B lies on line AD. So points A and D are connected by a line, and point B is somewhere on that line. So the order could be A---B---D, or maybe A---D---B, depending on where B is. But since angles involving B are mentioned, like ∠DBC and ∠CBD, perhaps B is between A and D?

But let's think about triangle relationships. Since there's a point C connected to various points. Let me consider possible triangles.

We know that ∠DAC = 42°, which is part of triangle ADC. Also, ∠CDA = 38°, so in triangle ADC, we can compute ∠ACD. Because the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°. So:

In triangle ADC,

∠DAC + ∠CDA + ∠ACD = 180°

So 42° + 38° + ∠ACD = 180°

That gives ∠ACD = 180 - 42 - 38 = 100°. So ∠ACD is 100 degrees.

Now, considering point B lying on line AD. So perhaps lines CB connects to point C, creating some triangles. Let me think about triangle ACB. We know that ∠CBA is 72°, and ∠ACB is angle3. If we can find another angle in triangle ACB, then we can find angle3.

Alternatively, maybe triangle CBD or something else is involved. Also, angle at B, ∠DBC is angle1, and ∠CBD is angle2. Wait, but angle2 is ∠CBD? Wait, the sixth constraint says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B, C, D)), MeasureOf(angle 2)). So Angle(B, C, D) is angle at C between B and D, so ∠BCD. Wait, no: Angle(B, C, D) is angle at C between B and D. So that's ∠BCD. So ∠BCD = angle2. Wait, but earlier we had ∠ACD = 100°, which is angle at C between A and D. So if we consider point B on AD, then ∠ACD is split into two parts: ∠ACB and ∠BCD? Or depends on where B is located.

Wait, suppose that point B is on AD. So imagine line AD with B somewhere on it. Then connecting point C to B. So lines CB connects C to B on AD. Thus, angle at C between A and D is ∠ACD, which we already found as 100°. Now, if we draw CB, then ∠ACB is part of that. Let me think: ∠ACB is the angle at C between A and B, and ∠BCD is the angle at C between B and D. So together, those two angles make up ∠ACD. Hence:

∠ACB + ∠BCD = ∠ACD

Which means angle3 + angle2 = 100°. So angle3 = 100° - angle2. Hmm. So if we can find angle2, then we can get angle3. Alternatively, maybe there's another relationship.

Additionally, looking at triangle CBD. Wait, if we consider triangle CBD, we might have angles involving angle1 and angle2. Wait, angle1 was defined as ∠DBC. Let me check:

Earlier, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D, B, C)), MeasureOf(angle 1)) — Angle(D, B, C) is angle at B between D and C, which is ∠DBC. So ∠DBC = angle1. Also, ∠CBD is angle at B between C and D, which is same as ∠DBC. Wait, but the sixth constraint says ∠(B,C,D) is angle2. Wait, that's angle at C between B and D, which is ∠BCD, which we said is angle2. So angle2 is ∠BCD. So in triangle CBD, we have angles at B (∠DBC = angle1), at C (∠BCD = angle2), and at D (∠BDC). Wait, but do we know anything about ∠BDC?

Wait, point D is connected to A and C. Also, point B is on AD. So line BD is part of line AD. Therefore, ∠BDC is the angle at D between B and C. Wait, but ∠BDC is part of triangle BDC. However, we also know that ∠CDA is 38°, which is the angle at D between C and A. Since B is on AD, then ∠CDA is the same as ∠CDB? Wait, no. Wait, when you have point B on AD, then from point D, the line DC makes an angle of 38° with DA. So if B is on DA, then the line DB is along DA. Therefore, the angle between DC and DB is still 38°, right? Wait, no. Because if B is on DA, then line DB is just a segment of DA. So the angle between DC and DB would be the same as ∠CDA, which is 38°, because DB is colinear with DA. Therefore, ∠BDC is 38°. Is that correct?

Wait, if B is on AD, then the line BD is part of AD. So from point D, looking towards A and B, which are colinear. So the angle between DC and DB is the same as angle between DC and DA, which is ∠CDA = 38°. Therefore, in triangle BDC, we have:

At D: ∠BDC = 38°, at B: ∠DBC = angle1, at C: ∠BCD = angle2. Therefore, the sum of angles in triangle BDC should be 180°:

angle1 + angle2 + 38° = 180°

Therefore, angle1 + angle2 = 142°. 

Earlier, we had from triangle ACD that angle3 + angle2 = 100°, so angle3 = 100° - angle2. 

If we can relate angle1 to something else, maybe through triangle ABC or other triangles.

Looking at triangle ABC. In triangle ABC, we know ∠CBA = 72°, and ∠ACB = angle3. What's the third angle? At point A, which is ∠BAC. Let me denote that as x. So in triangle ABC:

∠BAC + ∠ABC + ∠ACB = 180°

x + 72° + angle3 = 180°

Thus, x = 180° - 72° - angle3 = 108° - angle3.

But what is ∠BAC? Let me think. From earlier, we had ∠DAC = 42°, which is the angle at A between D and C. Since point B is on AD, then ∠DAC is the angle between DA and CA. But ∠BAC is the angle between BA and CA. Since B is on AD, then BA is along AD. So ∠BAC is the same as ∠DAC? Wait, no. Wait, if B is on AD, then the direction from A to D passes through B. So if we look at ∠BAC, it's the angle between BA and CA. But BA is along AD, so ∠BAC is the same as ∠DAC? Wait, no. Wait, ∠DAC is the angle between DA and CA. But ∠BAC is the angle between BA and CA. Since BA is along DA (since B is on AD), then ∠BAC is the same as ∠DAC. Because DA is the same line as BA extended beyond A to D. Wait, actually, if B is between A and D, then BA is from B to A, and DA is from D to A. So if B is between A and D, then ∠DAC is the angle between DA and CA, which would be the same as ∠BAC if BA is aligned with DA. Wait, this seems conflicting. Let me clarify:

Suppose the points are arranged as A---B---D. Then, from point A, the line AD goes through B to D. So ∠DAC is the angle between DA and CA. Since DA is going from A to D, which is through B. So ∠DAC is the angle between DA (from A to D) and CA. Meanwhile, ∠BAC is the angle between BA (which is from A to B) and CA. Since BA is part of DA, then ∠BAC is the same as ∠DAC. Wait, yes! Because BA is in the direction of DA. So ∠BAC equals ∠DAC, which is given as 42°. Therefore, in triangle ABC, ∠BAC = 42°, so substituting back into our previous equation:

x = 42°, so:

42° + 72° + angle3 = 180°

Adding 42 + 72 = 114°, so angle3 = 180 - 114 = 66°. 

Wait, so angle3 is 66°, which would correspond to option C. But let me verify this conclusion step by step to make sure I didn't skip anything.

So key steps:

1. In triangle ADC, angles are ∠DAC=42°, ∠CDA=38°, so ∠ACD = 100°. This is correct because 42+38=80, 180-80=100.

2. Since B lies on AD, then ∠BAC = ∠DAC = 42°, because BA is along DA. So in triangle ABC, angles are ∠BAC=42°, ∠ABC=72°, and ∠ACB=angle3. Summing them gives 42 + 72 + angle3 = 180 → angle3 = 66°. So answer is C.

But let me cross-check using the other equations to ensure consistency. Earlier, we had angle3 + angle2 = 100°, from the fact that ∠ACD = angle3 + angle2. If angle3 is 66°, then angle2 = 100 - 66 = 34°. Then, from triangle BDC, angle1 + angle2 = 142°, so angle1 = 142 - angle2 = 142 - 34 = 108°. 

Is there any way to check angle1 or angle2? For example, looking at triangle ABD or something else?

Alternatively, maybe there's another triangle where angle1 appears. Let me think. Angle1 is ∠DBC. In triangle DBC, we have angles ∠DBC = angle1, ∠BCD = angle2 = 34°, and ∠BDC = 38°, adding up to 108 + 34 + 38 = 180? Wait, 108 + 34 = 142 + 38 = 180. Yes, that works. So that checks out. 

Another check: in triangle ABC, angle3 is 66°, which is the measure of ∠ACB. Also, ∠ACB is part of the larger picture. 

So unless there's a mistake in assuming ∠BAC = ∠DAC, which I think is valid because B is on AD, making BA collinear with DA. Therefore, ∠BAC is indeed equal to ∠DAC. 

Hence, the measure of angle3 is 66°, which corresponds to option C. So the answer should be C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ m\angle 3 $, let us systematically analyze the given geometric constraints and use the fundamental properties of angles in triangles and straight lines.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Given Angles

From the problem, we are told:

- $ \angle CDA = 38^\circ $
- $ \angle DAC = 42^\circ $
- $ \angle CBA = 72^\circ $
- $ \angle ACB = m\angle 3 $ (this is what we're solving for)
- $ \angle BAC = \angle DAC = 42^\circ $ (because point $ B $ lies on line $ AD $)

This last observation is critical: **Since** $ B $ lies on line $ AD $, the angle $ \angle BAC $ (at vertex $ A $, between segments $ BA $ and $ CA $) is the same as $ \angle DAC $, which is given as $ 42^\circ $. So:

$$
\angle BAC = 42^\circ
$$

---

### Step 2: Use Triangle $ ABC $

We now focus on triangle $ ABC $, where we know:

- $ \angle BAC = 42^\circ $
- $ \angle ABC = 72^\circ $
- $ \angle ACB = m\angle 3 $

Using the **Triangle Angle Sum Theorem**, the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always $ 180^\circ $. So:

$$
\angle BAC + \angle ABC + \angle ACB = 180^\circ \\
42^\circ + 72^\circ + m\angle 3 = 180^\circ \\
m\angle 3 = 180^\circ - 114^\circ = 66^\circ
$$

---

### Step 3: Cross-Check Consistency

We can verify this by examining triangle $ ADC $, which contains angle $ \angle ACD $, made up of $ \angle ACB + \angle BCD $:

- $ \angle DAC = 42^\circ $
- $ \angle CDA = 38^\circ $
- So, $ \angle ACD = 180^\circ - 42^\circ - 38^\circ = 100^\circ $

Then, since $ \angle ACB = m\angle 3 $ and $ \angle BCD = \text{some value} $, their sum must be $ 100^\circ $. Therefore:

$$
m\angle 3 + \angle BCD = 100^\circ
$$

Assuming $ \angle BCD = 34^\circ $, then $ m\angle 3 = 66^\circ $, which confirms our earlier calculation.

---

### Final Verification

All values are consistent across different triangles and angle relations. Therefore, the measure of $ \angle ACB $ (i.e., $ m\angle 3 $) is:

$$
\boxed{66}
$$
