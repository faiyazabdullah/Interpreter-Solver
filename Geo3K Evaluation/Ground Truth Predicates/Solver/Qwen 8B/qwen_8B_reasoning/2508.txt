MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, and C. The problem gives some constraints about lengths and angles. Let me parse each part carefully.

First, the lengths: Length of line AB is 2x + 11, and length of line AC is 6x - 9. Then there are angle measures. It says that the measure of angle at A between points C and B (angle CAB) is equal to the measure of angle at B between points C and A (angle CBA). Also, that same angle CBA is equal to angle at A between points C and B again? Wait, maybe I need to clarify the notation here.

Wait, the first angle mentioned is MeasureOf(Angle(C, A, B)). In standard notation, Angle(C, A, B) would mean the angle at point A, with segments AC and AB. So that's angle CAB. Similarly, MeasureOf(Angle(C, B, A)) would be angle at point B, with segments BC and BA. So that's angle CBA. Then it also says MeasureOf(Angle(C, B, A)) equals MeasureOf(AAngle(A, C, B)). Wait, Angle(A, C, B) would be the angle at point C, with segments CA and CB. So angle ACB.

So putting it together:

Given:
1. AB = 2x + 11
2. AC = 6x - 9
3. Angle CAB = Angle CBA
4. Angle CBA = Angle ACB

Wait, so angle CAB equals angle CBA, which also equals angle ACB. That means all three angles at A, B, and C are equal? But wait, in a triangle, the sum of angles is 180 degrees. If all three angles are equal, then each is 60 degrees. So that would make triangle ABC equilateral? Wait, but only if all sides are equal. However, here the sides AB and AC are expressed in terms of x. So perhaps this implies that the triangle is equilateral?

But hold on, if angles at A, B, and C are all equal, meaning each is 60 degrees, then the triangle is equilateral. Therefore, all sides should be equal. So AB = AC = BC. But we have AB = 2x + 11 and AC = 6x - 9. So setting them equal:

2x + 11 = 6x - 9

Let me solve for x:

Subtract 2x from both sides: 11 = 4x - 9

Add 9 to both sides: 20 = 4x → x = 5.

But wait, before jumping to conclusion, let me check if that's valid. Because if angles at A, B, and C are all equal, then yes, the triangle is equilateral. But does the given information confirm that all three angles are equal?

The problem states:

MeasureOf(Angle(C, A, B)) = MeasureOf(Angle(C, B, A))

Which is angle CAB = angle CBA.

Then, MeasureOf(Angle(C, B, A)) = MeasureOf(Angle(A, C, B)), which is angle CBA = angle ACB.

Therefore, angle CAB = angle CBA = angle ACB. So all three angles are equal. Hence, triangle ABC is equiangular, hence equilateral. Therefore, all sides are equal. Thus AB = AC = BC. So solving AB = AC gives us x=5. Let me check if that makes sense.

If x=5, then AB = 2*5 + 11 = 10 + 11 = 21.

AC = 6*5 -9 = 30 -9 = 21. Yes, they are equal. So BC would also need to be 21. But since BC isn't given directly, but since the triangle is equilateral, BC would equal AB and AC. So that works. Therefore x=5. Which is option B.

But wait, another thought: could there be another scenario where angles are not all equal but still satisfy those conditions? For example, suppose angle CAB = angle CBA, but angle ACB is different. But according to the problem statement, angle CBA is equal to angle ACB. So angle CAB = angle CBA = angle ACB. Therefore, all three angles are equal. Therefore, triangle must be equilateral. Therefore, sides must be equal. Therefore, AB=AC. Hence x=5. So answer is B.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. Suppose that triangle ABC has two angles equal, making it isoceles. But according to the given, angle CAB equals angle CBA, which equals angle ACB. So all three angles are equal. Therefore, the triangle is equilateral. Therefore, all sides equal. Therefore, AB = AC. Solving 2x + 11 = 6x -9 gives x=5. So answer is B.

Another way: Maybe using the Law of Sines. If angles are all equal, then sides opposite are equal. So side opposite angle CAB is BC. Side opposite angle CBA is AC. Side opposite angle ACB is AB. Wait, no:

In triangle ABC, angle at A is CAB, which is angle A. The side opposite angle A is BC. Angle at B is angle CBA, which is angle B. The side opposite angle B is AC. Angle at C is angle ACB, which is angle C. The side opposite angle C is AB.

So if angles A, B, C are all equal, then their opposite sides must be equal. Therefore BC = AC = AB. Therefore, AB = AC, as above. So that confirms again that AB = AC. Therefore x=5. So answer is B. So answer choice B is 5. So the correct answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we start by analyzing the given geometric constraints and applying fundamental geometric principles.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Constraints**

We are told:

1. $ \text{Length}(AB) = 2x + 11 $
2. $ \text{Length}(AC) = 6x - 9 $
3. $ \angle CAB = \angle CBA $
4. $ \angle CBA = \angle ACB $

These imply that:

$$
\angle CAB = \angle CBA = \angle ACB
$$

This is a critical observation: **all three interior angles of triangle $ ABC $ are equal**.

---

### **Step 2: Use Triangle Angle Sum Property**

Since the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always $ 180^\circ $, and all three angles are equal:

$$
\angle CAB = \angle CBA = \angle ACB = 60^\circ
$$

This tells us that triangle $ ABC $ is **equiangular**, and therefore **equilateral** — all sides are equal.

---

### **Step 3: Set Equal Side Lengths**

From earlier, we know:

$$
\text{Length}(AB) = 2x + 11, \quad \text{Length}(AC) = 6x - 9
$$

Because triangle $ ABC $ is equilateral, the lengths of these sides must be equal:

$$
2x + 11 = 6x - 9
$$

Now solve for $ x $:

$$
2x + 11 = 6x - 9 \\
11 + 9 = 6x - 2x \\
20 = 4x \\
x = 5
$$

---

### **Step 4: Verify Consistency**

Plug $ x = 5 $ back into the expressions for the side lengths:

- $ AB = 2(5) + 11 = 21 $
- $ AC = 6(5) - 9 = 21 $

Both sides are equal, confirming that triangle $ ABC $ is indeed equilateral when $ x = 5 $. This satisfies all the given constraints.

---

### **Conclusion**

All steps lead logically to the conclusion that $ x = 5 $, and this matches one of the provided answer choices.

$$
\boxed{\text{Final Answer: B}}
