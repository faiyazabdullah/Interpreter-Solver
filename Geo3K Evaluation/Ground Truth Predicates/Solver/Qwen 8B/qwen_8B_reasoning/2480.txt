====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given information carefully. There are several angle equalities and some perpendicular lines mentioned. The goal is to find the measure of angle 6, which is denoted as ∠6. Let me start by listing out all the given constraints and see how they connect.

First, the angles that are equal:

1. Angle at G, C, A (which would be ∠GCA) equals angle 2.
2. Angle at C, B, F (∠CBF) equals angle 5.
3. Angle at B, D, C (∠BDC) equals angle 4.
4. Angle at F, B, D (∠FBD) equals angle 6.
5. Angle at A, C, E (∠ACE) equals angle 3.
6. ∠ACB is 51 degrees.
7. ∠FCB is 35 degrees.
8. ∠EBC is 28 degrees.
9. ∠CEB is 25 degrees.

Then there are some point-on-line conditions and perpendicularity:

- Point G lies on line AB and also on line BE. So G is the intersection of AB and BE? Wait, but since G is on both AB and BE, maybe it's the same as point B? No, because if G is on AB and also on BE, then unless B is the same as G, but maybe G is another point. Wait, but point A is on line BE? Wait, no. Let me check again:

Wait, the constraints say:

- PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(A, B)): So G is on line AB.
- PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(B, E)): So A is on line BE?
Wait, that seems conflicting. If A is on line BE, and G is on line AB, then perhaps points A, B, E are colinear? Because A is on BE, so BE is a line passing through A and B? But then line AB is part of BE?

Also, PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(E, G)): So A is on line EG. Hmm. So line EG passes through A. Since G is already on AB, then line EG connects E and G, which includes A. So E-G-A-B? Maybe forming a straight line? Or some configuration here.

Additionally, Perpendicular conditions:

- Line GC is perpendicular to GB. So GC ⊥ GB.
- Line FC is perpendicular to FB. So FC ⊥ FB.
- Line BC is perpendicular to BD. So BC ⊥ BD.

So, first, let me sketch a rough diagram mentally. Let me try to note down coordinates or relations based on these perpendiculars.

Starting with the perpendicular lines:

Since GC ⊥ GB, triangle GBC has a right angle at G. Similarly, FC ⊥ FB implies triangle FBC has a right angle at F. Also, BC ⊥ BD, meaning that at point B, the lines BC and BD form a right angle. Therefore, BD is perpendicular to BC. So, BD is perpendicular to BC, making angle CBD a right angle (since BC and BD meet at B).

Let me try to visualize this. Let's consider point B. From point B, we have line BC and BD such that BC ⊥ BD. So BD is perpendicular to BC. Then, from point B, there's also line BF, since FC is perpendicular to FB. So FB is perpendicular to FC. So at point F, line FC is perpendicular to FB. Similarly, at point G, line GC is perpendicular to GB.

Now, looking at the angles given:

∠ACB = 51°, which is angle at point C between points A and B. Also, ∠FCB = 35°, which is angle at point C between points F and B. And ∠EBC = 28°, which is angle at point B between points E and C. Also, ∠CEB = 25°, which is angle at point E between points C and B.

Hmm. Let me think about triangle EBC. In triangle EBC, we know two angles: ∠EBC = 28°, ∠CEB = 25°, so the third angle at point C, which is ∠ECB, can be calculated. Let me compute that.

In triangle EBC, sum of angles is 180°, so ∠ECB = 180° - 28° - 25° = 127°. Wait, but ∠ECB is part of angle ACB? Wait, angle ACB is given as 51°, which might be different. Wait, maybe there's overlapping lines here. Let me clarify.

Wait, point E is connected to B and C? Because ∠EBC and ∠CEB are mentioned. So point E is connected to B and C. Also, earlier mentions that A is on line BE. So line BE goes through A. Also, G is on line AB and line BE. So G is somewhere along AB and BE. But since A is on BE, then AB is part of BE? So G is a point on AB and BE, so G could be between A and B or extended beyond.

But let me focus on triangle EBC. If ∠EBC = 28°, ∠CEB = 25°, then ∠ECB = 180 - 28 - 25 = 127°, as above. However, angle ACB is given as 51°, which is at point C between points A and B. So if ∠ECB is 127°, then angle ACB is part of that? Wait, maybe not. Unless point A is aligned in such a way that angle ACB relates to ∠ECB.

Alternatively, maybe there's a transversal or something else. Let me try to consider coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to points can help.

Let me attempt coordinate geometry. Let's place point B at the origin (0,0). Since BC is perpendicular to BD, and BC is a line from B(0,0) to C. Let me assume BC is along the x-axis for simplicity. So point C is somewhere on the x-axis, say at (c, 0). Then BD is perpendicular to BC, so BD is vertical if BC is horizontal. Therefore, BD is along the y-axis direction. So point D is somewhere along the y-axis from B(0,0). Wait, but BD is perpendicular to BC, so direction of BD is vertical if BC is horizontal.

But then, there are other points. For example, point F is on line CD (as per constraint: PointLiesOnLine(F, Line(C,D)). Also, FC is perpendicular to FB. So line FC is perpendicular to FB. Let me try to define coordinates step by step.

Let me fix coordinates:

Set point B at (0,0). Let’s take BC along positive x-axis. Let me assign coordinates:

Let’s suppose point C is at (c, 0), so BC is horizontal. Since BD is perpendicular to BC, BD is vertical. So line BD is the y-axis. Therefore, point D is somewhere along the y-axis. Let me denote point D as (0, d) for some d. Wait, but BD starts at B(0,0) and goes up along y-axis. So D is (0, d).

Now, point F lies on line CD. Coordinates of C is (c, 0), D is (0, d). So line CD connects (c, 0) to (0, d). The equation of line CD can be parametrized as x = c - ct, y = 0 + dt, where t ∈ [0,1]. Alternatively, slope of CD is (d - 0)/(0 - c) = -d/c. So equation is y = (-d/c)(x - c).

Point F is on CD. Also, FC is perpendicular to FB. Let me find coordinates for F.

Let me denote F as (x, y) lying on line CD. Then, vector FC is (c - x, 0 - y), and vector FB is (0 - x, 0 - y) = (-x, -y). These vectors should be perpendicular, so their dot product is zero:

(c - x)(-x) + (-y)(-y) = 0 → -cx + x² + y² = 0 → x² + y² = cx.

But since F lies on CD, which has equation y = (-d/c)(x - c). Let me substitute y into the previous equation.

From line CD: y = (-d/c)(x - c) = (-d/c)x + d. Substitute into x² + y² = cx:

x² + [(-d/c x + d)]² = c x.

Expanding:

x² + (d²/c²)(x - c)^2 = c x.

Multiply through by c² to eliminate denominators:

c² x² + d²(x - c)^2 = c³ x.

Expand (x - c)^2: x² - 2c x + c².

Thus,

c² x² + d² x² - 2 c d² x + d² c² = c³ x.

Combine like terms:

(c² + d²)x² - (2 c d² + c³)x + d² c² = 0.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach. Alternatively, since FC ⊥ FB, triangle FBC is right-angled at F. So, using coordinates, with B at (0,0), C at (c,0), and F somewhere such that FB ⊥ FC.

Let me use coordinates for F as (x,y). Then, vectors FB = (x, y) and FC = (c - x, -y). Their dot product is x(c - x) + y*(-y) = cx - x² - y² = 0 → x² + y² = cx.

But since F lies on line CD, which connects C(c,0) and D(0,d). Parametric equations for CD: starting at C(c,0), moving towards D(0,d). Let me parameterize F as follows:

Let parameter t be such that when t=0, we're at C(c,0); t=1, at D(0,d). So coordinates of F are (c - c t, 0 + d t) = (c(1 - t), d t).

Therefore, x = c(1 - t), y = d t.

Substitute into x² + y² = c x:

[c² (1 - t)^2] + [d² t²] = c * [c(1 - t)]

Simplify:

c² (1 - 2t + t²) + d² t² = c² (1 - t)

Bring all terms to left side:

c² (1 - 2t + t²) + d² t² - c² (1 - t) = 0

Expand:

c² - 2 c² t + c² t² + d² t² - c² + c² t = 0

Simplify term by term:

c² - c² cancels.

-2c² t + c² t = -c² t.

c² t² + d² t² = t² (c² + d²).

So overall:

t² (c² + d²) - c² t = 0

Factor t:

t [ t (c² + d²) - c² ] = 0

Solutions: t = 0 or t = c² / (c² + d²)

But t=0 corresponds to point C (when t=0, F=C). However, if F=C, then FC would be zero length, which isn't meaningful. Hence, the valid solution is t = c²/(c² + d²). Thus, coordinates of F are:

x = c(1 - t) = c[1 - c²/(c² + d²)] = c[ (c² + d² - c²)/ (c² + d²) ) ] = c [d² / (c² + d²) ) ] = (c d²) / (c² + d² )

Similarly, y = d t = d * [c² / (c² + d²) ] = (c² d) / (c² + d² )

So coordinates of F are ( (c d²)/(c² + d² ), (c² d)/(c² + d² )) 

Now, knowing this, maybe we can find relationships between angles. However, this seems getting complex. Perhaps instead of coordinates, focusing on triangles and known angles.

Let me recall that ∠FCB = 35°. At point C, between F and B. So in triangle FBC, which is right-angled at F (because FC ⊥ FB). Therefore, triangle FBC is right-angled at F. Therefore, angles at B and C are complementary. Given that ∠FCB = 35°, then angle at B (∠FBC) is 90° - 35° = 55°. Wait, but ∠FBC is part of angle ∠EBC? Wait, ∠EBC is given as 28°, which is angle at B between E and C. So maybe ∠FBC is related to that?

Wait, if ∠FBC is 55°, but ∠EBC is 28°, then perhaps there's a relation between those angles? For instance, if points E, F, and others lie along certain lines.

Alternatively, since point F is on line CD, and we have BD perpendicular to BC, which is our setup. Also, there's point E involved. Let me think about point E.

Earlier, we had in triangle EBC, angles ∠EBC = 28°, ∠CEB = 25°, leading to ∠ECB = 127°, as computed before. However, angle ACB is given as 51°, which is at point C between points A and B. So if ∠ECB is 127°, then maybe there's a relationship between points A, E, and C?

Since point A is on line BE (from the constraint: PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(B,E)) ). So line BE contains point A. Also, G is on line AB and line BE, so G is a point on AB and BE. Which suggests that G is the intersection point of AB and BE. But since A is on BE, then G is either A or another point on AB. Wait, if A is on BE, then line AB is part of BE. So G is on AB and BE, hence G is a point on AB. But since A is on BE, then AB is part of BE, so G could be between A and B or extended.

Moreover, there's another condition: PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(E, G)). So point A lies on line EG. So line EG passes through A. Since G is on AB and BE, and A is on EG, then line EG connects E and G, passing through A. This suggests that points E, A, G are colinear. Since A is on BE and on EG, which connects E and G. So that makes sense.

Given all that, let me try to consider triangle ABC. We know angle ACB = 51°, and in triangle EBC, ∠ECB = 127°, which is larger than 51°, implying that point E is located such that CE extends beyond C? Wait, if ∠ECB is 127°, then from point C, line CE forms a large angle with CB. So maybe point E is on the opposite side of CB relative to some other points.

But let me try to relate angles. Since in triangle EBC, ∠ECB = 1角, which is 127°, and angle ACB = 51°, which is adjacent? Not sure yet. Maybe considering that line CE splits angle at C? Wait, if line CE exists, then angle ACB is split into two parts: angle ACE and angle ECB? Wait, but ∠ACE is mentioned as being equal to angle 3. Wait, the fifth equality says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A, C, E)), MeasureOf(angle 3)), so ∠ACE = angle 3. Also, we have ∠ECB = 127°, which may be ∠ECB = ∠ECB = ?

If line CE splits angle at C into ∠ACE and ∠ECB, then ∠ACE + ∠ECB = ∠ACB? Wait, no. Wait, if you have point E such that line CE is going from C to E, then depending on where E is, ∠ACB could be part of that. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Angle ACB is at point C between points A and B. If line CE is drawn from C to E, then angle ACE is at point C between points A and E, and angle ECB is at point C between points E and B. Therefore, ∠ACE + ∠ECB = ∠ACB? Only if E is positioned such that AE is extending from A through C to E? Wait, no. It depends on the position of E.

Wait, if E is somewhere such that line CE creates ∠ACE and ∠ECB adding up to ∠ACB. But according to earlier calculation, ∠ECB was 127°, while ∠ACB is 51°, which is impossible if they add up. Therefore, my assumption must be wrong. Hence, my earlier calculation of ∠ECB must be incorrect.

Wait, why did I calculate ∠ECB as 127°? Because I thought triangle EBC has angles ∠EBC=28°, ∠CEB=25°, so third angle ∠ECB=180-28-25=127. But if that leads to inconsistency with angle ACB=51°, then maybe my understanding of the triangle is wrong.

Wait, maybe E is not inside triangle ABC? Or perhaps the triangle EBC is not a standard triangle? Let me re-examine the given angles.

The angles given are:

- ∠EBC = 28°: this is angle at B between E and C.
- ∠CEB = 25°: angle at E between C and B.
- ∠ACB = 51°: angle at C between A and B.
- ∠FCB = 35°: angle at C between F and B.

Perhaps there are multiple triangles here. Let me consider triangle EBC again. Points E, B, C. Angles at B is 28°, at E is 25°, so angle at C should be 180-28-25=127°, which is ∠ECB. But how does this relate to angle ACB?

Maybe point A is not in the same plane as triangle EBC? No, all points seem to be in the same plane. So maybe there's another triangle involving point A and C. For example, if line CE intersects AB at some point, or something like that.

Alternatively, maybe line CE is not directly connected to A? Wait, but there is an angle ACE mentioned, which is angle at C between A and E. So line CE is connected to A via point C. So line CA and CE meet at C, creating angle ACE. So if ∠ACE is angle 3, and ∠ECB is 127°, then angle ACB = ∠ACE + ∠ECB? Wait, only if points A, E, and B are arranged such that E is outside of segment CB. Wait, for example, if E is on the extension of CB beyond B, then ∠ECB would be supplementary to ∠ACB. But that may not fit.

Wait, let me draw this mentally. Suppose we have point C, with line CB. If we extend CB beyond B to a point E, then ∠ECB would be a straight line, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, if E is on the other side of CB, such that line CE makes an angle with CB. 

Alternatively, perhaps angle ACB is made up of ∠ACE and ∠ECB? That is, if line CE divides angle ACB into two parts: ∠ACE and ∠ECB. But if that were true, then ∠ACE + ∠ECB = ∠ACB. But earlier calculation gave ∠ECB = 127°, which is greater than ∠ACB=51°, which is impossible. Hence, contradiction. Therefore, my assumption that triangle EBC has angles 28°, 25°, and 127° must be wrong.

Wait, maybe I misread the angles? Let me double-check the given angles.

The user wrote:

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(E, B, C)), 28): So ∠EBC = 28°.

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C, E, B)), 25): So ∠CEB = 25°.

Yes, so in triangle EBC, angles at B: 28°, at E: 25°, thus angle at C: 127°, which is ∠ECB. But how does that relate to angle ACB = 51°?

Unless point A is not in the same plane? Or there's a typo in my understanding. Alternatively, maybe the angle ACB is not directly related to ∠ECB, but there's another relationship.

Wait, maybe point A is located such that line CA creates some relation with ∠ECB. For example, if line CE intersects AB at some point, creating similar triangles or something.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that there are perpendicular lines. Earlier, we considered that BC ⊥ BD, and FC ⊥ FB, etc. Let me try to explore that.

We have BD perpendicular to BC, so at point B, BD is perpendicular to BC. So if BC is horizontal (as I assumed earlier), BD is vertical. So BD is along y-axis if BC is along x-axis. So point D is on y-axis. Then, line CD connects C to D, which is from (c,0) to (0,d). Point F is on CD, and FC ⊥ FB. As previously derived, coordinates of F are ((cd²)/(c² + d²), (c²d)/(c² + d²)).

Also, we know that ∠FCB = 35°. In triangle FBC, which is right-angled at F, angles at B and C are complementary. Since ∠FCB = 35°, then angle at B (∠FBC) = 90° - 35° = 55°. So ∠FBC = 55°. But earlier, ∠EBC = 28°, which is part of angle at B between E and C. How do these relate?

If ∠FBC = 55°, and ∠EBC = 28°, then maybe there's a relationship between these angles. For instance, if points E and F are on the same line from B? Or if line BE intersects with other lines?

Wait, since point E is connected to B and C, and ∠EBC = 28°, which is part of the angle at B between E and C. If ∠FBC is 55°, which is the angle at B between F and C, then if points E and F are on the same line from B, then the total angle between E and F would be 55° - 28° = 27°, or something like that. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if line BE is divided by some other points. Let me recall that point G is on line AB and BE. And line EG passes through A. So E, A, G are collinear. Also, G is on AB and BE. So line BE passes through A and G. Let me consider that.

Since A is on BE, and G is also on BE, then G is either between B and A, or A and G are on the extension. Let me assume that G is between B and A, or elsewhere.

But given that there's a right angle at G between GC and GB, which means that line GC is perpendicular to GB. So at point G, which is on line AB and BE, we have GC ⊥ GB. So if I imagine point G on line AB, and line GC is perpendicular to GB. So if I can find coordinates for G, it might help.

But this seems getting too abstract. Let me try to find relationships between the angles.

We have angle ACB = 51°, and in triangle EBC, angle at C is 127°, which seems contradictory. But maybe there's another triangle involving point A and C. For example, in triangle ACE, angle ACE = angle 3, and angle ACB = 51°, so if line CE is connected, then angle ACE + angle ECB = angle ACB? Wait, if line CE is between CA and CB, then yes. But earlier calculation said angle ECB is 127°, which would make angle ACE negative, which is impossible. So there must be an error in assuming that triangle EBC has angles 28°, 25°, and 127°. Let me check again.

Wait, the angles given are:

- ∠EBC = 28°: angle at B between E and C.
- ∠CEB = 25°: angle at E between C and B.
- ∠ACB = 51°: angle at C between A and B.
- ∠FCB = 35°: angle at C between F and B.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the order of points. Let me confirm the notation for angles. In Angle(E, B, C), this is the angle at B between E and C, so vertex at B, with segments BE and BC. So yes, that's ∠EBC = 28°.

Angle(C, E, B) is the angle at E between C and B, so vertex at E, with segments EC and EB. So that's ∠CEB = 25°.

So in triangle EBC, the three angles are ∠EBC = 28°, ∠CEB = 25°, and ∠ECB = 127°, as before. But this suggests that at point C, the angle between E and B is 127°, while angle ACB is 51°, which is the angle between A and B at point C. This implies that line CE is creating a larger angle at C, possibly extending beyond B or something. 

Wait, perhaps point A is located such that line CA is forming a smaller angle with CB, while line CE forms a larger angle. So, if you imagine point C with lines CB and CA, and line CE extending in a different direction. So, angle ACB is between CA and CB, and angle ECB is between EC and CB, so if line CE is on the opposite side of CB relative to CA, then ∠ECB would be supplementary to ∠ACB plus something. 

Wait, if I consider that at point C, there are two lines: CB and CA, creating angle ACB = 51°, and another line CE creating angle ECB = 127°, then the total around point C would be more than 180°, which is possible if lines CA and CE are on opposite sides of CB. 

But how does this help us? Well, if I can find the relationship between these angles and other parts of the figure.

Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines in triangle EBC. In triangle EBC, with angles 28°, 25°, and 127°, the sides are proportional to the sine of the opposite angles. Let me write that:

Let me denote sides:

- Opposite ∠EBC (28°): side EC.
- Opposite ∠CEB (25°): side BC.
- Opposite ∠ECB (127°): side EB.

So by Law of Sines:

EC / sin(28°) = BC / sin(25°) = EB / sin(127°).

But without knowing actual lengths, this might not help directly. However, if I can relate this to other parts of the diagram.

Also, we have angle ACB = 51°, which is at point C between A and B. If I can find some relationship between angle ACB and the other angles.

Alternatively, since there are perpendicular lines, maybe using right triangles. For example, triangle FBC is right-angled at F, with ∠FCB = 35°, so tan(∠FCB) = opposite/adjacent = FB / FC. Wait, in right triangle FBC, with right angle at F, so:

tan(∠FCB) = opposite / adjacent = FB / FC.

Wait, ∠FCB is at point C, so the sides are:

- Opposite to ∠FCB is FB.
- Adjacent is FC.

So tan(35°) = FB / FC.

Similarly, in triangle FBC, we can express FB and FC in terms of BC. Let me denote BC as length x. Then, using Pythagoras, FB² + FC² = BC².

But without specific lengths, it's hard to proceed. Maybe relating this to other triangles.

Alternatively, since we have multiple right angles, perhaps there are similar triangles or congruent triangles.

Another idea: since GC ⊥ GB and FC ⊥ FB, and BC ⊥ BD, these perpendiculars suggest that certain triangles are right-angled, which might allow us to apply properties of right triangles.

Let me revisit the problem statement and look for any missed clues. The question asks for m∠6, which is ∠FBD, as per the fourth equality: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(F, B, D)), MeasureOf(angle 6)). So ∠FBD is angle at B between F and D, which is angle 6. Our target is to find this angle.

To find ∠FBD, let me consider triangle FBD. To find its measure, we need to know other angles or sides. Let me think about what I know about point F and point D.

Point F is on line CD, and point D is on line BD (since BD is perpendicular to BC, as established earlier). So line BD is perpendicular to BC, and D is on it. Also, point F is on CD, and we have FC ⊥ FB. So, in triangle FBD, we need to find angle at B.

Alternatively, let me consider quadrilateral or other figures involving these points. Let me try to find relationships between angles at point B.

At point B, we have several angles:

- ∠EBC = 28°
- ∠FBC = 55° (from earlier analysis in triangle FBC)
- ∠ABD: since BD is perpendicular to BC, and assuming BC is horizontal, BD is vertical, so ∠ABC is the angle between BA and BC. Wait, but angle ABC is part of triangle ABC. Wait, but we know angle ACB = 51°, and if we can find other angles in triangle ABC, we might get more info.

Wait, in triangle ABC, we know angle at C is 51°. If we can find other angles, like angle at B or angle at A, that would help. Let me try.

But to find angle at B in triangle ABC, we need more information. However, we know that ∠EBC = 28°, which is part of angle at B. Let me think: if line BE passes through A, and ∠EBC = 28°, then angle between BE and BC is 28°. Also, line BA is part of BE, so angle between BA and BC is 28°? Wait, if BE contains BA, then ∠EBC is the same as ∠ABC? No, because ∠EBC is the angle between BE and BC, and since BA is on BE, then ∠EBC is the same as ∠ABC. Wait, that might be the key!

Wait, if line BE contains point A, then ∠EBC is the same as ∠ABC. So ∠ABC = ∠EBC = 28°. Is this correct? Let me verify.

Yes! Because if point A is on line BE, then the angle between BA and BC is the same as the angle between BE and BC, which is ∠EBC. Hence, ∠ABC = 28°.

So in triangle ABC, we have:

- ∠ABC = 28°
- ∠ACB = 51°
- Therefore, ∠BAC = 180° - 28° - 51° = 101°

Now, with this, we can find other angles.

But wait, there's also ∠FBC = 55°, which was calculated earlier from triangle FBC being right-angled at F with ∠FCB = 35°. So ∠FBC = 90° - 35° = 55°. But ∠FBC is the angle at B between F and C. Since ∠ABC is 28°, and ∠FBC is 55°, this suggests that point F is located such that line BF extends beyond point B, or in some other direction.

Wait, but ∠FBC is the angle between BF and BC. Since ∠ABC is 28°, which is the angle between BA and BC. If ∠FBC is 55°, then BF is forming a larger angle with BC compared to BA. This suggests that point F is on the opposite side of BC relative to A. 

But point F is on line CD, and D is on BD, which is perpendicular to BC. So, if BD is perpendicular to BC, and D is on BD, then line BD is at 90° to BC. Let me try to visualize this. If BC is horizontal, BD is vertical upwards from B. Point D is on BD. Line CD connects C to D, and F is on CD such that FC ⊥ FB. 

With this, let me consider triangle FBC again. We have ∠FBC = 55°, ∠FCB = 35°, right angle at F. Now, since ∠FBC = 55°, and ∠ABC = 28°, then the difference between these two angles is 55° - 28° = 27°. This suggests that line BF makes an angle of 27° with BA, since ∠ABC is 28°, and ∠FBC is 55°, so the angle between BF and BA is 55° - 28° = 27°. 

But how does this help us? Maybe relating to other parts of the diagram.

Now, returning to finding ∠FBD, which is angle at B between F and D. To find this, we need to consider the positions of F and D relative to B.

Since D is on BD, which is perpendicular to BC, and F is on CD. Let me consider the coordinates again, perhaps with concrete values.

Let me assign coordinates to simplify calculations. Let me set point B at (0,0), point C at (1,0) (so BC is along x-axis from (0,0) to (1,0)), and BD is vertical, so D is at (0, d) for some d > 0. 

Now, point F is on line CD. Let me find coordinates of F. As derived earlier, with C at (1,0) and D at (0,d), line CD has equation y = (-d)(x - 1). Let me choose specific values for simplicity. Let me pick d = 1 for simplicity, so D is (0,1). Then line CD is from (1,0) to (0,1), equation y = -x + 1.

Point F is on CD such that FC ⊥ FB. Using earlier formula, with c=1, d=1, then coordinates of F are:

x = (c d²)/(c² + d²) = (1*1²)/(1+1) = 1/2

y = (c² d)/(c² + d²) = (1*1)/(1+1) = 1/2

So F is at (0.5, 0.5). Let me verify if FC ⊥ FB.

Vector FC is from F(0.5, 0.5) to C(1,0): (1 - 0.5, 0 - 0.5) = (0.5, -0.5)

Vector FB is from F(0.5, 0.5) to B(0,0): (0 - 0.5, 0 - 0.5) = (-0.5, -0.5)

Dot product of FC and FB: (0.5)(-0.5) + (-0.5)(-0.5) = -0.25 + 0.25 = 0. Yes, they are perpendicular. Great.

Now, with this coordinate system, let me determine ∠FBD, which is the angle at B(0,0) between points F(0.5, 0.5) and D(0,1). 

To find ∠FBD, we can calculate the angle between vectors BF and BD.

Vector BF is from B to F: (0.5, 0.5)

Vector BD is from B to D: (0,1)

The angle between BF and BD can be found using the dot product formula:

cosθ = (BF • BD) / (|BF| |BD|)

Compute BF • BD = (0.5)(0) + (0.5)(1) = 0.5

|BF| = sqrt(0.5² + 0.5²) = sqrt(0.25 + 0.25) = sqrt(0.5) = √(1/2) = (√2)/2

|BD| = sqrt(0² + 1²) = 1

So cosθ = 0.5 / [(√2)/2 * 1] = 0.5 / (√2/2) = (0.5 * 2)/√2 = 1/√2 ≈ 0.7071

Which corresponds to θ = 45°, since cos(45°) = √2/2 ≈ 0.7071. Wait, but 1/√2 is equal to √2/2, so yes. So ∠FBD = 45°. 

Wait, but in this specific case with d=1, we got ∠FBD = 45°. But the answer choices don't include 45°. The options are A.25, B.28, C.35, D.55. Hmm. This suggests that either my coordinate choice introduced a special case, or there's a mistake in reasoning.

Wait, but the problem didn't specify particular lengths, so maybe ∠FBD is always 45° regardless of the specific coordinates? Let me check with another value of d.

Let me try with d=2. So point D is (0,2). Line CD is from C(1,0) to D(0,2). Equation of CD: y = -2x + 2.

Using the earlier formula for F's coordinates, with c=1, d=2:

x = (c d²)/(c² + d²) = (1*(4))/(1 + 4) = 4/5 = 0.8

y = (c² d)/(c² + d²) = (1*2)/5 = 2/5 = 0.4

So F is at (0.8, 0.4). Now, vectors:

BF is from B(0,0) to F(0.8, 0.4): (0.8, 0.4)

BD is from B(0,0) to D(0,2): (0,2)

Calculate angle between BF and BD.

Dot product BF • BD = 0.8*0 + 0.4*2 = 0 + 0.8 = 0.8

|BF| = sqrt(0.8² + 0.4²) = sqrt(0.64 + 0.16) = sqrt(0.8) = 2√(0.2) ≈ 0.8944

|BD| = 2

So cosθ = 0.8 / (sqrt(0.8)*2) = 0.8 / (2 * sqrt(0.8)) = 0.4 / sqrt(0.8) = 0.4 / (√(4/5)) = 0.4 / (2/√5) = 0.4 * √5 / 2 = (0.2) * √5 ≈ 0.2 * 2.236 ≈ 0.4472

Which corresponds to θ ≈ 63.43°, which is arccos(0.4472). But this contradicts the previous case where d=1 gave 45°. This suggests that ∠FBD varies depending on d, which means my initial assumption that it's fixed is wrong. Therefore, there must be additional constraints in the problem that I haven't used yet, such as the other angles and relationships.

Wait, but in the problem, we have other given angles like ∠ACB = 51°, ∠FCB = 35°, ∠EBC = 28°, ∠CEB = 25°, and others. In my coordinate system, I chose arbitrary d, but the rest of the angles might impose constraints on d. So I need to ensure that the chosen coordinates satisfy all given angles.

Let me return to the coordinate system with B(0,0), C(1,0), D(0,d), and F((cd²)/(c²+d²), (c²d)/(c²+d²)) with c=1, so F is ((d²)/(1+d²), d/(1+d²)).

Now, let's incorporate the other given angles. For instance, we know that ∠FCB = 35°. In this coordinate system, ∠FCB is the angle at C between F and B. Let me calculate this angle.

Point C is at (1,0), F is at (d²/(1+d²), d/(1+d²)), and B is at (0,0). Let me compute vectors CF and CB.

Vector CF = F - C = (d²/(1+d²) - 1, d/(1+d²) - 0) = ((d² - (1 + d²))/ (1 + d²), d/(1 + d²)) = (-1/(1 + d²), d/(1 + d²)).

Vector CB = B - C = (0 - 1, 0 - 0) = (-1, 0).

The angle between vectors CF and CB is ∠FCB, which is given as 35°. Let me compute this angle using the dot product.

Dot product of CF and CB: (-1/(1 + d²))*(-1) + (d/(1 + d²))*0 = 1/(1 + d²).

Magnitude of CF: sqrt[ (-1/(1+d²))^2 + (d/(1+d²))^2 ] = sqrt[(1 + d²)/(1 + d²)^2)] = sqrt[1/(1 + d²)] = 1/sqrt(1 + d²).

Magnitude of CB: sqrt((-1)^2 + 0^2) = 1.

So cos(∠FCB) = (dot product) / (|CF| |CB|) = [1/(1 + d²)] / [1/sqrt(1 + d²) * 1] = [1/(1 + d²)] / [1/sqrt(1 + d²)] = 1/sqrt(1 + d²).

Given that ∠FCB = 35°, so:

cos(35°) = 1/sqrt(1 + d²)

Solving for d:

sqrt(1 + d²) = 1 / cos(35°)

Square both sides:

1 + d² = 1 / cos²(35°)

Thus, d² = [1 / cos²(35°)] - 1 = tan²(35°)

Therefore, d = tan(35°)

So d = tan(35°). Let me compute tan(35°). Approximately, tan(35°) ≈ 0.7002.

So with d = tan(35°), now I can compute ∠FBD.

Recall that in this coordinate system, point F is at (d²/(1 + d²), d/(1 + d²)).

But since d = tan(35°), let's compute d²/(1 + d²):

Note that d = tan(θ), where θ = 35°, so d²/(1 + d²) = tan²θ / (1 + tan²θ) = tan²θ / sec²θ = sin²θ.

Similarly, d/(1 + d²) = tanθ / sec²θ = sinθ / secθ = sinθ cosθ.

So coordinates of F are (sin²θ, sinθ cosθ), where θ = 35°.

Now, vector BF is from B(0,0) to F(sin²θ, sinθ cosθ). Vector BD is from B(0,0) to D(0, d) = (0, tanθ).

To find ∠FBD, which is the angle between BF and BD.

Let me compute this angle using the dot product.

Vector BF: (sin²θ, sinθ cosθ)

Vector BD: (0, tanθ)

Dot product: (sin²θ)(0) + (sinθ cosθ)(tanθ) = 0 + sinθ cosθ * (sinθ / cosθ) = sin²θ

Magnitude of BF: sqrt[sin⁴θ + sin²θ cos²θ] = sinθ sqrt[sin²θ + cos²θ] = sinθ * 1 = sinθ.

Magnitude of BD: sqrt[0² + tan²θ] = tanθ.

Thus, cosφ = (sin²θ) / (sinθ * tanθ) = sinθ / tanθ = sinθ / (sinθ / cosθ) = cosθ.

Therefore, φ = arccos(cosθ) = θ = 35°.

Wait, this is brilliant! So ∠FBD = θ = 35°, which is the same as ∠FCB. But this contradicts the earlier examples where with d=1, I got 45°, but that was because I didn't satisfy the ∠FCB = 35° condition. Now, with d=tan(35°), we find that ∠FBD = 35°. But wait, this suggests that ∠FBD = 35°, which is option C. But let me verify this conclusion.

Wait, according to the calculation, ∠FBD = θ = 35°, which is the same as ∠FCB. But why? Because of the way d was chosen to satisfy ∠FCB = 35°, and through the trigonometric identities, it turned out that ∠FBD = 35°. Hence, the measure of angle 6, which is ∠FBD, is 35°, which is option C.

But let me cross-validate this with the given data. Are there any contradictions?

We had earlier determined in triangle ABC that ∠ABC = 28°, ∠ACB = 51°, so ∠BAC = 101°. Also, in triangle EBC, we had ∠EBC = 28°, ∠CEB = 25°, giving ∠ECB = 127°, which might relate to other parts.

However, with ∠FBD = 35°, which is option C, and given that the calculation shows that under the condition ∠FCB = 35°, ∠FBD = 35°, this seems consistent. But why is ∠FBD equal to ∠FCB?

It appears due to the construction where d is chosen such that ∠FCB = 35°, and through trigonometric identities, ∠FBD ends up being equal to that angle. This suggests that ∠6 = 35°, which is option C.

But let me check if there's another way to arrive at this result without coordinates.

Since we found that ∠FBD = ∠FCB = 35°, due to the construction, this would mean that ∠6 = 35°, which is option C. However, let me check if there's any other angle relationships that might affect this.

Wait, but in the problem, there is also ∠ACB = 51°, and ∠FCB = 35°, which are two different angles at point C. Since ∠ACB = 51°, and ∠FCB = 35°, and if these angles are adjacent, then ∠ACF = ∠ACB - ∠FCB = 51° - 35° = 16°. But this might not be directly useful.

Alternatively, since ∠FBD = 35°, which is option C, and given that this is derived from the given ∠FCB = 35°, and the construction, this seems plausible.

But let me check if there's any other constraint that might change this. For example, in triangle EBC, we had ∠ECB = 127°, which might relate to other parts. Let me see if this affects anything.

Point E is such that ∠EBC = 28°, ∠CEB = 25°, and ∠ECB = 127°. With ∠ECB = 127°, and ∠ACB = 51°, if line CE is such that it creates this angle, then maybe there's a relationship between lines CE and others.

But since we've already used the given ∠FCB = 35° to derive ∠FBD = 35°, and the other angles don't seem to interfere with this result, I think this is the correct answer.

Hence, the measure of angle 6 (∠FBD) is 35°, corresponding to option C.
