MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to visualize the given information. The problem mentions several points and lines with specific constraints. Let me start by listing out all the given information:

1. Point E lies on line AD.
2. Point B lies on line AC.
3. Lines DC and EB are parallel.
4. Given lengths: AE = 3, AB = 2, BC = 6, ED = 2x - 3. We need to find x.

Hmm, so there are points A, B, C, D, E involved. Let me try to sketch a rough diagram mentally. Since B is on AC, maybe triangle ABC? But also, E is on AD. Also, DC and EB are parallel. Maybe similar triangles are involved here?

Let me think about coordinates. Coordinates might help here. Assign coordinates to the points to make it easier. Let me place point A at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, since B is on AC, perhaps I can define coordinates for other points accordingly.

But first, let me note that AB = 2 and BC = 6. So AC is divided into AB + BC = 2 + 6 = 8 units. Therefore, AC has length 8. If I set up coordinate system with A at (0,0), then maybe C would be at (8,0). Wait, but then point B is between A and C. So AB = 2, so coordinates of B would be at (2,0)? Because moving along AC which is horizontal.

Wait, but then we have another line AD, with E lying on AD. And ED is given as 2x - 3. Also, DC is parallel to EB. Hmm. So DC is part of the line from D to C, and EB is from E to B. These two lines are parallel.

So maybe I need to assign coordinates to D and E such that these conditions hold. Let me proceed step by step.

First, set coordinates:

- Let’s fix point A at (0, 0).
- Since AC is a line, and AB = 2, BC = 6, then AC is 8 units long. Let me assume AC is along the x-axis for simplicity. So point C is at (8, 0). Then point B, being 2 units from A along AC, is at (2, 0).

Now, point E lies on line AD. But where is point D? Well, line AD connects A(0,0) to D. However, we don't know D's coordinates yet. Similarly, line DC connects D to C(8,0). Also, EB is parallel to DC.

Additionally, ED is given as 2x - 3. So once we find coordinates for E and D, we can compute ED's length.

Since E lies on AD, let me parametrize AD. Let me denote D as some point (d_x, d_y). Then line AD goes from (0,0) to (d_x, d_y). Any point on AD can be expressed as t*(d_x, d_y) where t is between 0 and 1. Let me say E is somewhere on AD, so E can be represented as (t*d_x, t*d_y) for some parameter t.

But we need more relations. Let's consider the parallelism condition: DC || EB.

Vector DC is from D to C: C - D = (8 - d_x, 0 - d_y)

Vector EB is from E to B: B - E = (2 - e_x, 0 - e_y)

Since DC || EB, their direction vectors must be scalar multiples. So,

(8 - d_x, -d_y) = k*(2 - e_x, -e_y) for some scalar k.

Also, since E is on AD, E = t*D, assuming t is between 0 and 1? Or maybe not necessarily? Wait, E could be extended beyond D if necessary, but since ED is given as positive length, probably E is between A and D or beyond.

Alternatively, maybe using ratios. Since E is on AD, we can express AE/ED ratio? Wait, but ED is given as 2x - 3, and AE is given as 3. So AE = 3, ED = 2x - 3. Thus, AD = AE + ED = 3 + (2x - 3) = 2x. So AD has length 2x.

But how does that relate to other parts?

Alternatively, since DC is parallel to EB, maybe using similar triangles or coordinate slopes.

Let me think about slopes. The slope of DC equals the slope of EB.

Slope of DC: (y_C - y_D)/(x_C - x_D) = (0 - d_y)/(8 - d_x) = -d_y / (8 - d_x)

Slope of EB: (y_B - y_E)/(x_B - x_E) = (0 - y_E)/(2 - x_E) = -y_E / (2 - x_E)

Therefore, setting them equal:

-d_y/(8 - d_x) = -y_E/(2 - x_E)

Which simplifies to:

d_y/(8 - d_x) = y_E/(2 - x_E)

But since E lies on AD, which goes from A(0,0) to D(d_x, d_y). So parametric equations for AD: x = d_x * s, y = d_y * s, where s is a real number (parameter). Here, when s=0, it's A; when s=1, it's D.

So coordinates of E are (s*d_x, s*d_y). So x_E = s*d_x, y_E = s*d_y.

Thus, substituting into the slope equation:

d_y / (8 - d_x) = (s*d_y) / (2 - s*d_x)

Assuming d_y ≠ 0 (otherwise, if d_y = 0, DC would be horizontal, but then EB would also have to be horizontal. Let me check later if that's possible.)

Assuming d_y ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by d_y:

1 / (8 - d_x) = s / (2 - s*d_x)

Cross multiplying:

2 - s*d_x = s*(8 - d_x)

Expanding RHS: 8s - s*d_x

So:

2 - s*d_x = 8s - s*d_x

Adding s*d_x to both sides:

2 = 8s => s = 2/8 = 1/4.

So s = 1/4. That means E divides AD in the ratio AE:ED = s : (1 - s)? Wait, no. Wait, if E is on AD, then AE corresponds to the parameter s? Wait, when s=0, E=A; when s=1, E=D. So AE length depends on the actual distance. Wait, but earlier, we had AE = 3, and ED = 2x - 3. So total AD = AE + ED = 3 + (2x - 3) = 2x. Therefore, AD has length 2x.

But how does s relate to the length? If AD has length 2x, then AE = s * AD? Not exactly unless the parameter s is proportional to the distance. Wait, actually, if we use vector parameters, then yes, if the coordinates are linear, then the length would scale with s. But only if the direction vector is normalized. Wait, but in reality, the parameter s isn't necessarily related directly to the length unless we normalize.

However, since we have AE = 3 and ED = 2x - 3, and AD = AE + ED = 2x. So the ratio AE/AD = 3/(2x). But according to the parameter s, since E is at s=1/4, then AE would correspond to s=1/4 times the length of AD? Wait, that would mean AE = (1/4)*AD. Which would imply 3 = (1/4)*(2x) → 3 = x/2 → x=6. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Is this correct?

Wait, let me verify. If E is located at s=1/4 along AD, meaning from A to D, then AE is 1/4 of AD? No, because in parametric terms, if you go from A to D, then the position vector of E is s times the vector AD. So the length AE would be |s| * |AD|. So if s = 1/4, then AE = (1/4)|AD|. But according to our previous calculation, AE is given as 3, and |AD| is 2x. So:

AE = (1/4)(2x) → 3 = (1/4)(2x) → 3 = x/2 → x = 6. So x=6. Which is option B. But let me check if my assumption that s=1/4 implies AE = (1/4)AD is correct.

Yes, because the parameter s scales the entire vector AD. So if you move s fraction along AD, then the length from A to E is s multiplied by the length of AD. Hence, AE = s * AD. Therefore, if s=1/4, then AE = (1/4)AD. Since AD = 2x, then AE = (1/4)(2x) = x/2. Given that AE is 3, x/2 = 3 ⇒ x = 6. Therefore, the answer is B. 6.

Wait, but why did we get s=1/4? Let me recheck that step. Earlier, we derived that s=1/4 from equating slopes. Let me confirm that again.

We had:

From slopes equality:

After substituting E's coordinates as (s*d_x, s*d_y):

d_y / (8 - d_x) = (s*d_y) / (2 - s*d_x)

Then cancelling d_y (assuming non-zero):

1/(8 - d_x) = s/(2 - s*d_x)

Cross multiply:

2 - s*d_x = s*(8 - d_x)

Expand RHS: 8s - s*d_x

So LHS: 2 - s*d_x

Set equal to RHS: 8s - s*d_x

Subtracting LHS from both sides: 0 = 8s - 2 ⇒ 8s = 2 ⇒ s=2/8=1/4. Correct.

So s=1/4. Therefore, AE = s*AD. But AD is from A(0,0) to D(d_x, d_y). So its length is sqrt((d_x)^2 + (d_y)^2). But we were told that AE = 3. However, in our case, we assumed that AE = s * AD. But is that accurate?

Wait, no! Because the parameter s in the parametric equation represents scaling the vector AD. So if the coordinates of E are (s*d_x, s*d_y), then the vector AE is s times vector AD, hence the length AE is s * |AD|. So yes, AE = s * |AD|. Therefore, if we can find |AD|, then we can find s.

But we don't know |AD|. However, we do know that AE = 3. So 3 = s * |AD|. But we also have ED = |AD| - AE = |AD| - 3. But ED is given as 2x - 3. Therefore:

ED = |AD| - 3 = 2x - 3 ⇒ |AD| = 2x.

Therefore, substituting back into AE = s * |AD|:

3 = s * 2x.

But we already found s = 1/4. So:

3 = (1/4)*2x ⇒ 3 = x/2 ⇒ x = 6.

So x=6. Which is option B. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me check if there are alternative approaches. For example, using mass point or similar triangles.

Alternative approach: Since DC || EB, triangles ADC and something else?

Wait, considering lines DC and EB are parallel. So maybe triangle AEB similar to some triangle?

Alternatively, using vectors.

But maybe coordinates are sufficient here. Alternatively, using ratios.

Since DC || EB, then the ratio of AE/AD should equal the ratio of BE/BC? Wait, not sure. Let me think.

Alternatively, since DC || EB, then the triangles formed may be similar.

Wait, suppose we look at transversal lines. Let me think of the lines intersecting.

Since DC is parallel to EB, then maybe the intercept theorem (Thales' theorem) applies.

The intercept theorem states that if two lines are cut by transversals, then the segments are proportional.

But how to apply here?

Let me think of line AD and line AC. Wait, not sure. Let me try to think of the lines that cross.

Alternatively, since E lies on AD, and B lies on AC, and DC || EB. Let me imagine extending lines if needed.

Another way: Using coordinates again, but maybe assigning coordinates differently.

Earlier, I set A(0,0), C(8,0), B(2,0). Let me assign coordinates to D and E.

Let me assume D is some arbitrary point (p, q). Then E is on AD, so E can be written as (tp, tq) for some t between 0 and 1 (if E is between A and D). But since ED is given as 2x - 3, which is positive, so E could be on the extension beyond D, depending on t.

But regardless, the relation from slopes gave us s=1/4, leading to x=6. Let me check if this holds even without knowing exact coordinates.

Alternatively, since DC is parallel to EB, then the vector DC is equal to some multiple of EB.

Vector DC = C - D = (8 - p, 0 - q)

Vector EB = B - E = (2 - tp, 0 - tq)

Since they are parallel, there exists a scalar λ such that:

8 - p = λ(2 - tp)

and

-q = λ(-tq)

From the second equation:

-q = -λ t q ⇒ Assuming q ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by q:

-1 = -λ t ⇒ λ t = 1 ⇒ λ = 1/t

Substitute into first equation:

8 - p = (1/t)(2 - tp)

Multiply both sides by t:

t(8 - p) = 2 - tp

Expand left side: 8t - pt = 2 - pt

Add pt to both sides: 8t = 2 ⇒ t = 2/8 = 1/4.

Same result as before. So t = 1/4.

Therefore, E divides AD in the ratio AE:ED = t:(1 - t)? Wait, no. Wait, if E is on AD, then the parameter t in E = tD (from A) would mean that AE = t * AD. Wait, earlier conclusion was that AE = t * |AD|. So since t = 1/4, then AE = (1/4)|AD|. As before.

Given that AE = 3, then |AD| = 4 * AE = 12. Wait, hold on, earlier I thought |AD| = 2x, but according to this, |AD| = 4 * AE = 4*3 = 12. Therefore, 2x = 12 ⇒ x = 6. Same answer. So x=6. Hence, answer is B.

This confirms the same result. Therefore, the answer is B.

I think this makes sense. All steps lead to x=6. Let me check if there's any missing piece. For instance, is there a possibility that D is not in the plane or something? Probably not, since all points are defined in Euclidean geometry. Also, the problem didn't mention anything about angles or other constraints, so the solution via coordinates and proportions should hold.

Hence, the correct answer is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the value of $ x $, we begin by analyzing the given geometric constraints and relationships:

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Geometry**

We are given the following key facts:

- Points **E** lies on **line AD**
- Point **B** lies on **line AC**
- **Lines DC** and **EB** are **parallel**
- Lengths:  
  - $ AE = 3 $
  - $ AB = 2 $
  - $ BC = 6 $
  - $ ED = 2x - 3 $

We aim to find the value of $ x $.

---

### **Step 2: Coordinate Setup**

To simplify, we place the points in the coordinate plane:

- Set $ A = (0, 0) $
- Since $ AB = 2 $ and $ BC = 6 $, and both lie on the same line, place:
  - $ B = (2, 0) $
  - $ C = (8, 0) $, since $ AB + BC = 2 + 6 = 8 $

Let $ D = (p, q) $. Then line $ AD $ passes through the origin and $ D $, so any point $ E $ on line $ AD $ can be expressed as a scalar multiple of the vector $ \vec{AD} $. Specifically:

$$
E = t(p, q) = (tp, tq)
$$

where $ t \in \mathbb{R} $ determines the location of $ E $ along the line.

---

### **Step 3: Use Parallelism Condition**

We're told that lines $ DC $ and $ EB $ are **parallel**, i.e., their **direction vectors are scalar multiples**.

Compute the direction vectors:

- Vector $ \vec{DC} = (8 - p, 0 - q) = (8 - p, -q) $
- Vector $ \vec{EB} = (2 - tp, 0 - tq) = (2 - tp, -tq) $

For these vectors to be parallel, there must exist a scalar $ \lambda $ such that:

$$
\vec{DC} = \lambda \cdot \vec{EB}
$$

So,
$$
8 - p = \lambda(2 - tp), \quad -q = \lambda(-tq)
$$

From the second equation:
$$
-q = -\lambda t q \Rightarrow \lambda t = 1 \Rightarrow \lambda = \frac{1}{t}
$$

Plug this into the first equation:
$$
8 - p = \frac{1}{t}(2 - tp)
\Rightarrow t(8 - p) = 2 - tp
\Rightarrow 8t - pt = 2 - pt
\Rightarrow 8t = 2 \Rightarrow t = \frac{1}{4}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Determine $ x $ Using Segment Ratios**

We now know that $ t = \frac{1}{4} $, which means point $ E $ divides segment $ AD $ in the ratio:

$$
AE : ED = t : (1 - t) = \frac{1}{4} : \frac{3}{4} = 1 : 3
$$

So,
$$
AE = \frac{1}{4} \cdot AD \Rightarrow AD = 4 \cdot AE = 4 \cdot 3 = 12
$$

We’re also given:
$$
ED = 2x - 3
$$

But since $ AD = AE + ED $, we substitute:

$$
AD = AE + ED = 3 + (2x - 3) = 2x
$$

Equating with the earlier expression:

$$
2x = 12 \Rightarrow x = 6
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

By applying the concept of scalar multiplication of vectors based on the parallelism condition and using the known segment ratios, we arrive at the final value of $ x $.

$$
\boxed{\text{Final Answer: B}}
$$
