MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have several angles given with certain measures and some equalities. The goal is to find the measure of angle 1. Let me start by writing down all the given information so I can visualize it better.

First, they mention:

- Angle at Y, between X and Z (Angle(Y, X, Z)) is 105 degrees. Wait, angle notation can sometimes be confusing. In standard terms, Angle(Y, X, Z) would mean the angle at point X between points Y and Z? Or wait, no—usually, the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(Y, X, Z) should be the angle at point X formed by points Y, X, Z. Wait, that seems odd because typically the middle letter is the vertex. So for example, angle ABC is at point B. Therefore, Angle(Y, X, Z) would be the angle at point X between Y and Z. So that's angle YXZ, which is ∠YXZ. Similarly, Angle(Z, Y, X) would be angle at Y between Z and X, so ∠ZYX. 

But maybe I need to draw a diagram. Since there are points X, Y, Z, W mentioned. Let me try to sketch mentally. There might be a quadrilateral or triangle involved here. But since there are four points (X, Y, Z, W), perhaps it's a quadrilateral? Or maybe two triangles connected?

Let me note down each given angle:

1. Measure of ∠YXZ = 105°. So angle at X between Y and Z is 105°.

2. Measure of ∠ZYX = Measure of angle 1. Because Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(Z, Y, X)), MeasureOf(angle 1)). So ∠ZYX equals angle 1.

Wait, ∠ZYX is the same as ∠YXZ? No, wait. Let me clarify again. If the angle is written as Angle(Z, Y, X), then the vertex is Y. So it's ∠ZYX. Which is the angle at Y between Z and X. So that's different from ∠YXZ, which is at X between Y and Z.

So, given that ∠YXZ = 105°, and ∠ZYX = angle 1.

Then, next:

3. Measure of ∠XWZ = 23°. Wait, Angle(X, W, Z). So vertex at W, between X and Z. So ∠XWZ. Wait, no—if it's Angle(X, W, Z), then the vertex is W. So it's ∠XWZ, meaning the angle at W between X and Z. So that's 23 degrees.

4. Measure of ∠ZW X = 24°. Wait, Angle(W, Z, X). Vertex at Z, between W and X. So that's ∠WZX. So angle at Z between W and X is 24 degrees.

Then:

5. Measure of ∠XZY = Measure of angle 2. Because Angle(X, Z, Y) is ∠XZY. So that's angle at Z between X and Y, which is angle 2.

6. Measure of ∠ZWX = Measure of angle 3. Wait, Angle(Z, X, W)—vertex at X between Z and W. So that's ∠ZWX, which is angle at X between Z and W. Wait, but earlier we had ∠YXZ = 105°, which is at X between Y and Z. Now this is ∠ZWX, which is at X between Z and W. So these could be adjacent angles at point X?

Also, another equality: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(Z, Y, X)), MeasureOf(Angle(X, Z, Y))). So ∠ZYX (which is angle 1) equals ∠XZY (which is angle 2). So angle 1 equals angle 2.

So putting all together:

We have triangle XYZ? Maybe? Let me check. Points X, Y, Z. We know ∠YXZ = 105°, and ∠ZYX = angle 1, and ∠XZY = angle 2. And angle 1 equals angle 2. So in triangle XYZ, sum of angles is 180°, so 105 + angle1 + angle2 = 180. But since angle1 = angle2, then 105 + 2*angle1 = 180 → 2*angle1 = 75 → angle1 = 37.5°. Wait, that seems straightforward. But hold on—are those three angles part of triangle XYZ?

Yes, because ∠YXZ is at X, ∠ZYX is at Y, and ∠XZY is at Z. So yes, triangle XYZ. Then angle1 is ∠ZYX, angle2 is ∠XZY. So their sum plus 105 gives 180. Therefore angle1 = 37.5°, which is option A. But wait, why do they give other information about points W and angles involving W? Is there something wrong here?

Wait, maybe there's more to the problem. Because the presence of point W suggests that there are other parts. For instance, angles involving W: ∠XWZ = 23°, ∠WZX = 24°, and ∠ZWX = angle3. Also, ∠ZWX is at X between Z and W. Wait, but maybe there's a triangle or quadrilateral involving W?

Alternatively, maybe there's a larger figure. Let me think. Suppose points X, Y, Z form triangle XYZ, and point W is somewhere else connected to them. For example, maybe W is connected to Z and X, forming another triangle or quadrilateral.

Given that ∠XWZ = 23°, which is at W between X and Z. And ∠WZX = 24°, which is at Z between W and X. So triangle WXZ? Let me consider triangle WZX. In triangle WZX, angles at W, X, Z.

At Z, angle is 24° (∠WZX). At W, angle is 23° (∠XWZ). Therefore, the third angle at X in triangle WZX would be 180 - 23 - 24 = 133°. That angle is ∠WXZ, which is at X between W and Z. Wait, but earlier we had ∠YXZ = 105°, which is at X between Y and Z. So if there's another angle at X between W and Z, which is 133°, then how does that fit?

If both angles at X are present, then maybe points Y and W are on opposite sides of line XZ? So that ∠YXZ is 105°, and ∠WXZ is 133°, making the total around point X?

Wait, but angles around a point sum up to 360°. However, unless points Y and W are arranged such that they create adjacent angles at X. For example, suppose lines XY and XW are on different sides of XZ. Then, the angles at X would be ∠YXZ (between Y and Z) and ∠WXZ (between W and Z). If they are adjacent, then the sum would be ∠YXZ + ∠WXZ = angle between Y and W at X. But unless there's a straight line or something else.

Alternatively, maybe points Y and W are on the same side of XZ, leading to overlapping angles? Not sure yet. But let's see.

Wait, if we look at triangle WZX, we found that angle at X is 133°, which is ∠WXZ. But previously, we thought that angle1 (which is ∠ZYX) equals angle2 (which is ∠XZY). From triangle XYZ, angle1 was found as 37.5°, but maybe that's incorrect if there's more to the problem?

Wait, but maybe there's a contradiction here. Let me check again. Suppose that in triangle XYZ, angles are 105°, angle1, angle2, with angle1=angle2. Then angle1 would be (180 - 105)/2 = 37.5°, which is option A. But then why include the other information about point W? Unless there's more to the problem. Maybe my initial assumption that triangle XYZ exists is wrong?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a quadrilateral or another triangle involved. Let me re-examine the given angles.

Another given is that ∠ZWX = angle3. Which is angle at X between Z and W. Wait, no: Angle(Z, X, W) is angle at X between Z and W. So ∠ZWX is the angle at X between Z and W. Wait, but earlier we had ∠WXZ (from triangle WZX) being 133°, which is the angle at X between W and Z. So ∠WXZ is the same as ∠ZWX? Wait, no. Wait, ∠ZWX is the angle at X between Z and W? Wait, confusion arises again.

Hold on, let me get back to basics. The notation Angle(A, B, C) refers to the angle at point B between points A and C. So:

- ∠(Y, X, Z): angle at X between Y and Z → ∠YXZ.

- ∠(Z, Y, X): angle at Y between Z and X → ∠ZYX.

- ∠(X, W, Z): angle at W between X and Z → ∠XWZ.

- ∠(W, Z, X): angle at Z between W and X → ∠WZX.

- ∠(X, Z, Y): angle at Z between X and Y → ∠XZY.

- ∠(Z, X, W): angle at X between Z and W → ∠ZXW.

So, ∠ZXW is the angle at X between Z and W. Earlier, in triangle WZX, the angles were:

At W: ∠XWZ = 23°,

At Z: ∠WZX = 24°,

Therefore, angle at X in triangle WZX is ∠WXZ (same as ∠ZXW?), which would be 180 - 23 -24 = 133°, so ∠ZXW = 133°.

Now, in triangle XYZ, we have ∠YXZ = 105°, which is at X between Y and Z. Now, if there's also ∠ZXW = 133°, which is at X between Z and W. So, depending on the position of W relative to Y and Z, these angles could be adjacent or not. For example, if points Y and W are on opposite sides of line XZ, then the total angle at X would be ∠YXZ + ∠ZXW = 105 + 133 = 238°, which is possible if they're on opposite sides. Alternatively, if they are on the same side, then maybe they overlap?

But regardless, the key thing is that in triangle XYZ, angle at X is ∠YXZ = 105°, and in triangle WZX, angle at X is ∠ZXW = 133°. These are two separate angles at point X. So, if they are adjacent, their sum would be part of a larger angle. But unless there's a straight line or something else.

However, maybe there's a relationship between these angles. For instance, if points Y, X, W are colinear? But that's not stated. Hmm.

But going back to the original question: Find measure of angle1, which is ∠ZYX (from earlier). In triangle XYZ, that angle is angle1, which we initially computed as 37.5°, assuming only triangle XYZ. But if there's more structure, like involving point W, maybe that affects the calculation?

Wait, but how? Unless there's some cyclic quadrilateral or something else. Let me think again.

Suppose we have triangle XYZ with ∠YXZ = 105°, and ∠ZYX = angle1, ∠XZY = angle2. Given that angle1 = angle2. So angle1 = (180 - 105)/2 = 37.5°, which would make sense. But why does the rest of the information matter? It must be that there's more to the problem, perhaps implying that triangle XYZ isn't independent?

Wait, perhaps points W and others affect the angles? Like, maybe triangle WZX is connected to triangle XYZ via some relation?

For instance, if lines YX and WZ intersect at some point, but without more info, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, maybe the entire figure is a pentagon or something, but with only four points mentioned.

Alternatively, perhaps angle1 is not in triangle XYZ but elsewhere? Wait, angle1 is defined as MeasureOf(Angle(Z, Y, X)), which is ∠ZYX, which is in triangle XYZ. So angle1 is part of triangle XYZ. So unless there's a mistake in the previous reasoning.

Wait, but if there's another angle at X (the 133°), then maybe that creates a linear pair or something. For example, if ∠YXZ and ∠ZXW are supplementary? But 105 + 133 = 238 ≠ 180. So that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe there's another triangle involving angle1?

Alternatively, maybe there's a transversal or parallel lines involved. But we don't have any info about that.

Hmm. This is perplexing. The given data includes angles related to point W, but if we ignore them, we can compute angle1 as 37.5°, which is option A. But since the problem provides other angles, maybe there's a trick here. Perhaps my initial assumption that triangle XYZ is valid is wrong?

Wait, let's double-check the problem statement. It says:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(Z, Y, X)), MeasureOf(angle 1))"

Which means ∠ZYX = angle1.

And "Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(X, Z, Y)), MeasureOf(angle 2))", which is ∠XZY = angle2.

Then "Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(Z, Y, X)), MeasureOf(Angle(X, Z, Y)))" which implies ∠ZYX = ∠XZY, so angle1 = angle2. Hence, in triangle XYZ, angles at Y and Z are equal, making it an isosceles triangle with base XY or XZ? Wait, no. In triangle XYZ, if angles at Y and Z are equal, then sides opposite are equal. So side opposite ∠Y is XZ, and side opposite ∠Z is XY. So if ∠Y = ∠Z, then XZ = XY. But that's not directly helpful unless we have more info.

But regardless, the sum of angles in triangle XYZ is 180°, so:

∠YXZ + ∠ZYX + ∠XZY = 105 + angle1 + angle2 = 180.

Since angle1 = angle2, then:

105 + 2*angle1 = 180 → 2*angle1 = 75 → angle1 = 37.5°, which is option A.

So why are the other angles given? They might be red herrings, or perhaps there's more to the problem that requires using them. But according to the current information, angle1 is determined solely by triangle XYZ.

But perhaps there's a misunderstanding in interpreting the diagram. Let me think again. Are points X, Y, Z, W coplanar? Probably. Could there be a scenario where the angles involving W affect angle1?

For example, if lines YX and WZ are intersecting at some point, creating vertical angles or something? Or maybe triangle WXY or something else?

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involving angle1 and other angles?

Wait, if ∠ZXW is 133°, and ∠YXZ is 105°, then if those two angles are adjacent, the total angle at X would be 105 + 133 = 238°, which is more than 180°, suggesting that points Y and W are on opposite sides of line XZ. But that's possible.

But even then, how does that relate to angle1? It might not directly. Unless there's a triangle involving W and Y?

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle YXW? But we don't have enough information about its angles.

Alternatively, maybe the sum of angles around point X? Around point X, the total is 360°. If we have ∠YXZ = 105°, ∠ZXW = 133°, and possibly other angles. But unless there are more angles at X, we can't say much.

Wait, but what if there's another angle at X? For example, if there's a line from X to W, and another line from X to Y, and maybe another line from X to some other point. But without more information, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, maybe there's a typo in the problem, and some of the given angles are meant to relate to other parts. But assuming the problem is correctly formulated, then angle1 is determined independently.

Alternatively, perhaps the fact that ∠XWZ = 23° and ∠WZX = 24° implies something about triangle WZX, which may connect to other parts.

In triangle WZX, angles are 23°, 24°, and 133°, as before. So that's fixed. But how does this relate to the rest?

Maybe if we consider that line WZ intersects with other lines? Or maybe there's a parallelogram or something?

Alternatively, maybe triangle XYZ and triangle WZX share some common elements?

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involving angle1 and the other angles?

Wait, angle1 is ∠ZYX, which is at Y. What about other angles at Y? For example, if there's a line from Y to W, creating other angles?

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging. However, since the problem gives us specific relationships, perhaps we can use the fact that angle1 is part of triangle XYZ, and the other angles involve point W, but they don't interfere with the calculation of angle1. Thus, the answer remains 37.5°, which is option A.

But let me verify once more. Suppose that angle1 is indeed 37.5°, and the other angles are just extra info. The problem might have been designed to test whether you get distracted by irrelevant information. So even though there's more info, angle1 is purely based on triangle XYZ.

Thus, I think the correct answer is A. 37.5°.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of $ \angle 1 $, we begin by analyzing the geometric constraints provided in the problem. The key relationships and angle definitions are summarized below:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Angles**

From the problem:

- $ \angle YXZ = 105^\circ $
- $ \angle ZYX = \angle 1 $
- $ \angle XZY = \angle 2 $
- $ \angle ZYX = \angle XZY $ ⇒ $ \angle 1 = \angle 2 $

This tells us that the triangle formed by points $ X, Y, Z $ has the following angles:

- At $ X $: $ \angle YXZ = 105^\circ $
- At $ Y $: $ \angle ZYX = \angle 1 $
- At $ Z $: $ \angle XZY = \angle 2 = \angle 1 $

Hence, triangle $ XYZ $ has two equal angles: $ \angle ZYX $ and $ \angle XZY $, both equal to $ \angle 1 $. This makes triangle $ XYZ $ **isosceles** with base $ XY $ or $ XZ $, depending on which angle is the apex.

---

### **Step 2: Use Triangle Angle Sum**

The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always $ 180^\circ $. Applying this to triangle $ XYZ $:

$$
\angle YXZ + \angle ZYX + \angle XZY = 180^\circ
$$

Substituting known values:

$$
105^\circ + \angle 1 + \angle 1 = 180^\circ
$$

$$
105^\circ + 2\angle 1 = 180^\circ
$$

$$
2\angle 1 = 75^\circ
$$

$$
\angle 1 = \frac{75}{2} = 37.5^\circ
$$

---

### **Step 3: Consider Other Information**

Other angle measurements involving point $ W $ (e.g., $ \angle XWZ = 23^\circ $, $ \angle WZX = 24^\circ $, etc.) describe a separate triangle $ WZX $, and while they contribute to understanding the full geometric configuration, **none of these angles affect the value of $ \angle 1 $**, which lies entirely within triangle $ XYZ $.

These additional details serve as context but do not influence the computation of $ \angle 1 $, which depends only on the internal angles of triangle $ XYZ $.

---

### **Conclusion**

The measure of $ \angle 1 $ is derived solely from the angles inside triangle $ XYZ $, and the result is:

$$
\boxed{37.5}
$$

---

**Final Answer: A**
