MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, and C. Let me note down all the given information first.

First, they say that the length of line BC is equal to y. But wait, we need to find x, which is the length of line AC. Hmm. Also, the measure of angle at point C between points B, C, A is 60 degrees. Wait, angle BCA is 60 degrees? Or is it angle at C between B, C, A? Yeah, that would mean angle at C, so angle BCA is 60 degrees.

Then, the length of line AC is x, and the length of AB is 8√3. Also, lines AB and AC are perpendicular. Oh! So AB is perpendicular to AC. That means triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at point A? Wait, because if AB and AC are perpendicular, then the right angle is at A. Wait, but angle at C is 60 degrees. Wait, hold on. If AB and AC are perpendicular, then angle at A is 90 degrees. But angle at C is given as 60 degrees. So maybe I need to draw this triangle.

Let me visualize triangle ABC with right angle at A. Then sides AB and AC are legs, and BC is the hypotenuse. But angle at C is 60 degrees. Wait, in a right-angled triangle, angles sum up to 180. So angle at A is 90°, angle at C is 60°, so angle at B must be 30°, since 90 + 60 + 30 = 180. Okay, so that makes sense.

So in such a triangle, the sides are in the ratio of 1 : √3 : 2 for a 30-60-90 triangle. Wait, but here, which side corresponds to which?

In a standard 30-60-90 triangle, the sides opposite 30°, 60°, and 90° are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. Here, angle at C is 60°, so the side opposite to angle C (which is AB) should be opposite 60°, and the side opposite angle B (which is 30°) is AC. Wait, let me confirm:

Angle at A is 90°, angle at C is 60°, angle at B is 30°. Therefore:

- Side opposite angle A (which is BC) is the hypotenuse.
- Side opposite angle B (which is AC) is the shorter leg.
- Side opposite angle C (which is AB) is the longer leg.

Wait, so AB is opposite angle C (60°), so AB is the longer leg. AC is opposite angle B (30°), so AC is the shorter leg. And BC is the hypotenuse.

Given that AB is 8√3, which is the longer leg. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the longer leg is √3 times the shorter leg. So AB = √3 * AC. Therefore, since AB is 8√3, then:

AB = √3 * AC → 8√3 = √3 * AC → Divide both sides by √3: 8 = AC. So AC is 8. Hence, x equals 8. Which would make the answer option A.

But let me check again. Because sometimes I mix up which side is which. Let me re-express:

In triangle ABC, right-angled at A. So AB and AC are legs, BC is hypotenuse. Angle at C is 60°, so angle between AC and BC is 60°, meaning that angle at C is 60°, so the side opposite angle C is AB. Therefore, AB is opposite 60°, which in the standard ratios is longer leg. The shorter leg is AC (opposite 30°). Therefore, AB = AC * tan(60°). Since tan(60°) is √3, so AB = AC * √3. Given AB is 8√3, so solving gives AC = 8. Therefore, x = 8, which is option A. 

Alternatively, using Pythagoras. Let me think. Suppose AC = x, AB = 8√3, and BC is hypotenuse. Then BC^2 = AB² + AC². But also, since angle at C is 60°, maybe use trigonometry. For example, in triangle ABC, cos(angle at C) = adjacent / hypotenuse. Wait, angle at C is 60°, adjacent side to angle C is AC, and hypotenuse is BC. So cos(60°) = AC / BC. Similarly, sin(60°) = AB / BC. 

We know cos(60°) is 0.5. So AC / BC = 0.5 → BC = 2AC. Also, sin(60°) is (√3)/2 = AB / BC → AB = BC*(√3)/2. Substitute BC = 2AC into this equation: AB = 2AC*(√3)/2 = AC*√3. Which matches earlier conclusion. Therefore, AB = AC * √3 → 8√3 = x * √3 → x = 8. So yes, x is 8. So answer A.

But let me check if there's another way someone might approach it incorrectly. For instance, if someone thought angle at C was the right angle, but no, because AB and AC are perpendicular, so right angle is at A. So angle at C is 60°, which is part of the triangle. So everything checks out. So answer is A, 8.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we begin by analyzing the geometric constraints provided:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Triangle Structure**

We are told:

- $ \text{Length}(AB) = 8\sqrt{3} $
- $ \angle BCA = 60^\circ $
- $ \text{Line}(AB) \perp \text{Line}(AC) $

From these facts, we can deduce that **triangle $ABC$** has:

- A **right angle at point A**, because $ AB \perp AC $.
- An **angle of $60^\circ$ at point C** ($ \angle BCA = 60^\circ $).
- Thus, the remaining angle at point B is $ 180^\circ - 90^\circ - 60^\circ = 30^\circ $.

This confirms that triangle $ABC$ is a **special 30-60-90 triangle**, with angles of $30^\circ$, $60^\circ$, and $90^\circ$.

---

### **Step 2: Use Properties of a 30-60-90 Triangle**

In a **30-60-90 triangle**, the sides are in the fixed ratio:

$$
\text{Shorter leg (opposite } 30^\circ): \text{Longer leg (opposite } 60^\circ): \text{Hypotenuse} = 1 : \sqrt{3} : 2
$$

Here:

- $ \angle B = 30^\circ $, so $ AC $ is the **shorter leg** (opposite $30^\circ$).
- $ \angle C = 60^\circ $, so $ AB $ is the **longer leg** (opposite $60^\circ$).
- $ BC $ is the **hypotenuse**.

---

### **Step 3: Apply the Ratio Relationship**

Using the known value of $ AB = 8\sqrt{3} $, which is the **longer leg**, we apply the relationship:

$$
\frac{\text{Longer Leg}}{\text{Shorter Leg}} = \sqrt{3}
$$

Let $ x = AC $, the shorter leg. Then:

$$
\frac{8\sqrt{3}}{x} = \sqrt{3}
$$

Multiply both sides by $ x $:

$$
8\sqrt{3} = x\sqrt{3}
$$

Divide both sides by $ \sqrt{3} $:

$$
x = 8
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

The unknown side $ AC = x $ is therefore:

$$
\boxed{x = 8}
$$

Thus, the correct answer is:

$$
\boxed{A}
$$

---

**Final Answer: A**
