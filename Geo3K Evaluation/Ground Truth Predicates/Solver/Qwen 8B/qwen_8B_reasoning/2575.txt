MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, first, I need to visualize the diagram based on the given constraints. Let me start by listing out all the information provided.

We have points R, S, Q, T, and A. Also, there's a circle centered at point C with radius 7.0, and all points R, S, T, Q lie on this circle. That means they're concyclic points—so maybe forming some cyclic quadrilateral or triangle? Wait, but we also have point A lying on lines SQ and RT. Hmm, so point A is the intersection of lines SQ and RT?

Let me sketch mentally. Points R, S, Q, T are on a circle. Point A is somewhere such that it lies on both SQ and RT. So, perhaps A is the intersection point of diagonals SQ and RT? Or maybe another configuration?

Now, angles mentioned:

Measure of angle(R, S, Q) is 5x + 4. That would be ∠RSQ, right? Because angle notation is vertex in the middle. Similarly, measure of angle(S, Q, T) is 32°, which is ∠SQT. And measure of angle(R, T, Q) is 6x - 2, which is ∠RTQ.

So, these three angles are at different vertices. Let me think about how these angles relate. Since points R, S, T, Q are on a circle, maybe there's something with cyclic quadrilaterals here. But wait, depending on the order of the points on the circle.

Alternatively, since A is on SQ and RT, maybe triangles are involved. For example, triangle RSQ and triangle RTQ? Let me see.

Wait, angle RSQ (which is ∠RSQ) is part of triangle RSQ. Similarly, angle SQT (∠SQT) is part of triangle SQT, and angle RTQ (∠RTQ) is part of triangle RTQ.

But maybe there's a way to use the fact that points R, S, T, Q lie on a circle. If those four points are on a circle, then certain angle relationships hold. For instance, inscribed angles subtended by the same arc are equal, or opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral sum to 180 degrees. However, I need to figure out the positions of the points.

Alternatively, since point A is on SQ and RT, maybe considering triangle SQT and triangle RQT? Or perhaps using vertical angles or something else.

Wait, let me consider the angles around point Q. At point Q, there are two angles mentioned: ∠SQT = 32°, and ∠RQT = 6x - 2. Wait, no—the third angle mentioned is ∠RTQ. Let me clarify each angle.

Angle RSQ: Vertex at S, between R and Q. So that's angle at S between RS and SQ.

Angle SQT: Vertex at Q, between S and T. So that's angle at Q between SQ and QT.

Angle RTQ: Vertex at T, between R and Q. So that's angle at T between RT and TQ.

Hmm. Maybe looking for triangle relations. Let me check if triangles RSQ and RTQ share some properties.

Alternatively, since points R, S, T, Q are on a circle, then maybe applying cyclic quadrilateral properties. If R, S, T, Q are on a circle, then quadrilateral RSTQ is cyclic. Therefore, opposite angles sum to 180°. But which angles?

Wait, but we have angles at S, Q, T. Let me think. In cyclic quadrilateral RSTQ, the opposite angles would be ∠R and ∠T, or ∠S and ∠Q. Wait, but we don't know angles at R or T directly. Alternatively, maybe using the fact that angles subtended by the same chord are equal.

Alternatively, since point A is on SQ and RT, maybe considering triangle ASQ and ART? Not sure yet.

Wait, let's look at the angles again. Let's denote:

∠RSQ = 5x + 4 (at S)

∠SQT = 32° (at Q)

∠RTQ = 6x - 2 (at T)

Is there a relationship between these angles? Let me see. Maybe considering triangle SQT. In triangle SQT, we know one angle at Q is 32°, and maybe other angles?

Wait, but without knowing more sides or other angles, maybe not. Alternatively, considering triangle RTQ. In triangle RTQ, we have ∠RTQ = 6x - 2, and maybe other angles?

Alternatively, since points R, S, T, Q are on a circle, then maybe using power of a point or something else related to intersecting chords. Since point A lies on SQ and RT, which are chords of the circle. The intersecting chords theorem says that the products of the segments are equal. But do we have lengths? Not directly, unless we can find them through angles.

Wait, but maybe using the Law of Sines or Cosines in triangles involving these angles. Since all points lie on a circle of radius 7, so maybe their distances from center C are all 7 units. But how does that help?

Alternatively, since angles are given in terms of x, maybe setting up equations based on triangle angle sums or cyclic quadrilateral properties.

Let me think again. Suppose quadrilateral RSTQ is cyclic. Then, the sum of angles ∠S and ∠T should be 180°, but I need to confirm which angles those are. Wait, in cyclic quadrilaterals, opposite angles are supplementary. So, if RSTQ is cyclic, then ∠R + ∠T = 180°, and ∠S + ∠Q = 180°. But I don't know ∠R or ∠T yet.

Wait, but maybe I can express ∠R and ∠T using the given angles. Let me try.

First, let's note that ∠RSQ is an angle in triangle RSQ. Let me consider triangle RSQ. In that triangle, the angles are:

At S: ∠RSQ = 5x + 4

At Q: ?

At R: ?

Similarly, in triangle RTQ, the angles are:

At T: ∠RTQ = 6x - 2

At Q: ?

At R: ?

But maybe there's another approach. Let me think about the angles formed by the intersecting chords. When two chords intersect, the measure of the angle is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. Wait, yes! That might be useful here.

Since point A lies on SQ and RT, so the two chords SQ and RT intersect at A. The angle formed at A between SQ and RT would be equal to half the sum of the intercepted arcs. But we don't have the measure of that angle directly. However, maybe we can relate it to other angles.

Wait, but we have angles at S and T. Let me recall the formula: when two chords intersect at a point inside the circle, the measure of the angle is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. So, if two chords AB and CD intersect at E, then ∠AEC = ½(m arc AC + m arc BD).

In our case, the intersecting chords are SQ and RT, intersecting at A. Therefore, the angle at A between SQ and RT would be ½(m arc SR + m arc QT). But we don't know that angle directly. However, perhaps we can find expressions for those arcs via other angles.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that angles at the circumference relate to arcs. For example, ∠RSQ is an inscribed angle intercepting arc RQ. Similarly, ∠RTQ intercepts arc RQ as well? Wait, no. Let me think carefully.

∠RSQ is at point S, so it intercepts arc RQ. Because in an inscribed angle, the angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So ∠RSQ intercepts arc RQ. Similarly, ∠RTQ is at point T, intercepting arc RQ? Wait, if you have point T, then ∠RTQ intercepts arc RQ? Wait, no. Let me draw mentally. If you have triangle RTQ, with vertex at T, then ∠RTQ intercepts arc RQ. Yes, because the angle is formed by chords TR and TQ, so the intercepted arc is RQ. Therefore, both ∠RSQ and ∠RTQ intercept arc RQ. Hence, they should be equal? Wait, but ∠RSQ = 5x + 4 and ∠RTQ = 6x - 2. If they intercept the same arc, then they should be equal. Therefore:

5x + 4 = 6x - 2 → solving gives x = 6. Is that possible?

Wait, if that's true, then x=6. Let me check that. If ∠RSQ and ∠RTQ intercept the same arc RQ, then they must be equal. But why would they intercept the same arc? Let me verify.

Yes, ∠RSQ is at point S, between R and Q, so it intercepts arc RQ that does not contain S. Similarly, ∠RTQ is at point T, between R and Q, so it intercepts arc RQ that does not contain T. However, since points R, S, T, Q are on the circle, the arcs RQ could be major or minor arcs. But if the points are arranged such that S and T are on opposite sides of RQ, then the intercepted arcs might be different. However, if the arcs are considered as the ones not containing the other points, then if S and T are on opposite sides, the intercepted arcs would be the same? Wait, maybe not. This seems conflicting.

Wait, but if both angles ∠RSQ and ∠RTQ intercept the same arc RQ, then they should be equal. But according to the problem, they are given as 5x +4 and 6x -2. Therefore, equating them would give x=6. However, this assumes that both angles intercept the same arc, which may not necessarily be the case. So, maybe my assumption is wrong here. Let me think again.

Perhaps ∠RSQ intercepts arc RQ, while ∠RTQ intercepts arc RQ as well? Wait, but if points R, S, T, Q are on the circle, then depending on the position of S and T relative to RQ, the intercepted arcs could be different. However, if S and T are on opposite sides of RQ, then the intercepted arcs would be the same. But without knowing the exact positions, how can I be sure?

Alternatively, maybe there's another relation. Let me think about triangle SQT. We know that ∠SQT = 32°, and if we can find other angles in that triangle. But to do that, we need more info.

Alternatively, since points R, S, T, Q are concyclic, then maybe using cyclic quadrilateral properties. Let's suppose that RSTQ is cyclic. Then, the sum of ∠S and ∠T is 180°, but again, I need to define which angles.

Wait, in cyclic quadrilaterals, the exterior angle is equal to the interior opposite angle. For example, ∠S is adjacent to ∠T. Wait, maybe not. Let me recall: in a cyclic quadrilateral ABCD, ∠A + ∠C = 180°, and ∠B + ∠D = 180°. Also, the exterior angle is equal to the interior opposite angle. For instance, extending side AD to form an exterior angle at A, then that exterior angle equals ∠BCD.

But how does that apply here? Let me consider quadrilateral RSTQ. Assuming it's cyclic. Then, ∠S + ∠T = 180°. But what are ∠S and ∠T here?

Wait, ∠S is probably ∠RSQ? No, ∠S in the quadrilateral would be ∠RST? Wait, confusion arises. Let me clarify the labeling.

Quadrilateral RSTQ has vertices R, S, T, Q connected in order. So the angles at each vertex would be:

At R: ∠QRT?

Wait, no. Let me imagine the order of the quadrilateral. If the points are labeled R, S, T, Q in order around the circle, then the angles of the quadrilateral would be:

At R: between Q and S,

At S: between R and T,

At T: between S and Q,

At Q: between T and R.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Maybe better to assign labels properly. Let me assume that the quadrilateral is R-S-T-Q-R. Then, the angles would be:

∠R: between Q and S,

∠S: between R and T,

∠T: between S and Q,

∠Q: between T and R.

But how does this relate to the angles given in the problem?

The problem mentions:

∠RSQ (which is at S between R and Q),

∠SQT (at Q between S and T),

∠RTQ (at T between R and Q).

These angles are not necessarily the internal angles of the quadrilateral. For example, ∠RSQ is part of triangle RSQ, and ∠SQT is part of triangle SQT.

This is getting complicated. Let me go back to the earlier thought about the intercepted arcs.

If ∠RSQ and ∠RTQ intercept the same arc RQ, then they should be equal. However, if they are on different arcs, then their measures depend on which arc they intercept. 

Suppose that both angles ∠RSQ and ∠RTQ intercept arc RQ. Then, since they are inscribed angles, they should be equal. Thus, 5x +4 = 6x -2 => x=6. If this holds, then substituting x=6 into the angles:

∠RSQ = 5(6)+4 = 34°, and ∠RTQ = 6(6)-2 = 34°. So both are 34°, which makes sense. Then, if this is correct, then x=6.

Then, we need to find m∠S. Which angle is that? The question asks for m∠S. Wait, the problem says "Find m∠S." Which angle is ∠S? Depending on the context. Usually, ∠S refers to the angle at point S. But in the given problem, the angles mentioned were ∠RSQ, ∠SQT, and ∠RTQ. So maybe ∠S refers to ∠RSQ, which is 5x +4. But if x=6, then that would be 34°, which would correspond to option D. But let me check if that's correct.

Wait, but the problem says "Find m∠S". Depending on the diagram, ∠S could be referring to ∠RSQ, which is given as 5x +4. However, if that's the case, then with x=6, that angle is 34°, which is option D. But let me make sure that this reasoning is valid.

However, earlier assumption that ∠RSQ and ∠RTQ intercept the same arc RQ might not be accurate. Let me re-examine this.

For ∠RSQ, which is at point S, between R and Q. This angle intercepts arc RQ that does not include S. Similarly, ∠RTQ is at point T, between R and Q, so it intercepts arc RQ that does not include T. Now, if points S and T are on opposite sides of arc RQ, then the intercepted arcs would be the same. However, if they are on the same side, then they'd intercept different arcs. But since all four points R, S, T, Q are on the circle, it depends on their arrangement.

Assuming that points R, S, T, Q are arranged on the circle in such a way that arc RQ is the same for both angles. But without loss of generality, maybe we can proceed with that assumption, especially since it leads us to a consistent solution.

So proceeding with x=6, leading to ∠RSQ = 34°, which would be angle at S. But wait, the problem asks for m∠S. However, in the given angles, ∠RSQ is at S. So if that's the case, then the answer would be 34°, which is option D.

But let me cross-verify. Let's check if there's another way to find x. For example, using triangle SQT.

In triangle SQT, we know ∠SQT = 32°, and if we can find other angles. Let's assume that ∠SQT = 32°, and maybe relate it to other angles.

Alternatively, since points R, S, T, Q are on a circle, then ∠SQT is an inscribed angle. What arc does it intercept? It's at point Q, between S and T, so it intercepts arc ST. Therefore, measure of ∠SQT = ½ measure of arc ST. So arc ST = 2 * 32° = 64°.

Also, earlier, if ∠RSQ = 5x +4 and ∠RTQ = 6x -2, and assuming they intercept arc RQ, then arc RQ = 2*(5x +4) = 10x +8, and also arc RQ = 2*(6x -2) = 12x -4. Setting them equal:

10x +8 = 12x -4 ⇒ 8 +4 = 12x -10x ⇒ 12 = 2x ⇒ x=6. Same result.

Therefore, arc RQ is 10*6 +8 = 68°, or 12*6 -4 = 68°, which matches. So that confirms x=6.

Now, with x=6, we can find other things. Let me check if there are other relationships.

For example, arc ST is 64°, as established above. Arc RQ is 68°. Since the total circumference is 360°, but we need to relate other arcs.

But how does this help us find m∠S? Wait, ∠S is likely referring to ∠RSQ, which we've already determined as 5x +4 = 34°, which is option D. However, let me make sure that there isn't another angle at S that we need to calculate.

Alternatively, maybe ∠S refers to the angle at point S in the quadrilateral RSTQ. Which would be ∠RST. Wait, but we don't have direct information about that. But if we can compute it.

Wait, let me think. In the cyclic quadrilateral RSTQ, the sum of ∠S and ∠T is 180°. Let me define ∠S as ∠RST and ∠T as ∠RTQ?

Wait, no. Earlier, I considered ∠SQT as being part of triangle SQT. Let me get back.

Alternatively, considering triangle SQT, we know ∠SQT = 32°, and if we can find other angles in that triangle. But to do that, we need more info.

Alternatively, since we know arc ST = 64°, and arc RQ = 68°, then maybe finding other arcs?

The entire circle is 360°, so sum of all arcs should be 360°. Let me assume that the arcs between the points are as follows:

Arc RQ = 68°, arc ST = 64°, and then the remaining arcs QR... Wait, no. Let me think again. The arcs between consecutive points. If the points are ordered R, S, T, Q around the circle, then the arcs would be:

arc RS, arc ST, arc TQ, arc QR.

But we know arc ST = 64°, and arc RQ = 68°. Wait, arc RQ would be from R to Q, passing through the rest of the circle. But if the points are ordered R, S, T, Q, then arc RQ would pass through S and T, making it arc RSTQ. But that would be the whole circle minus arc QT. Hmm, confusing.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the arcs intercepted by the angles.

But perhaps I can find the measure of ∠SQT, which we said was 32°, corresponding to arc ST = 64°. Then, if we can find other arcs.

Additionally, we had arc RQ = 68°, from the angles at S and T. So if we can find the other arcs.

But maybe there's another angle. For instance, ∠RTQ is 34°, which intercepts arc RQ. So, if we can find other angles.

Alternatively, let me think about triangle RTQ. In triangle RTQ, we have ∠RTQ = 34°, and if we can find other angles. For instance, ∠TRQ and ∠TQR.

But since R, T, Q are on the circle, ∠TRQ intercepts arc TQ. Wait, but I don't know the measure of arc TQ. However, if we knew arc TQ, we could find ∠TRQ.

Alternatively, since the entire circle is 360°, and we have arc ST = 64°, arc RQ = 68°, but I need to find other arcs.

Alternatively, since points R, S, T, Q are on the circle, and we have arcs ST = 64°, arc RQ = 68°, and other arcs. Let me try adding them up.

But without knowing the order of the points, it's challenging. Let me assume that the points are placed in order R, S, T, Q around the circle. Then, the arcs between them would be:

arc RS, arc ST, arc TQ, arc QR.

Total circumference is arc RS + arc ST + arc TQ + arc QR = 360°.

We know arc ST = 64°, arc RQ = 68°. Wait, arc RQ would be from R to Q, which in this ordering would be arc RQ going through S and T? No, in the ordering R, S, T, Q, arc RQ would be arc R to Q passing through S and T, which would be arc RS + arc ST + arc TQ. But that would be larger than arc RQ if we consider the shorter arc. Hmm, confusion arises again.

Maybe instead of trying to find all arcs, focus on what's needed for ∠S.

Wait, the question asks for m∠S. If ∠S refers to ∠RSQ, which we found as 5x +4 = 34°, then the answer is D. But let me check if there's another interpretation.

Another possibility: ∠S could refer to the angle at point S in the quadrilateral, which would be ∠RST. How can we find that?

In cyclic quadrilateral RSTQ, ∠RST + ∠RTQ = 180°, because in cyclic quadrilaterals, the sum of opposite angles is 180°. Wait, but ∠RST is at point S, and ∠RTQ is at point T. So, yes, if RSTQ is cyclic, then ∠RST + ∠RTQ = 180°.

We have ∠RTQ = 6x - 2 = 34° (when x=6), so ∠RST = 180° - 34° = 146°. But that's a large angle, and none of the options are 146°, so that suggests that ∠S is not ∠RST.

Alternatively, maybe ∠S refers to ∠SQT, which is given as 32°, but that's one of the known values. But 32° is option C.

Wait, but the problem states "Find m∠S", which typically denotes the angle at point S. So, which angle at point S is that?

Possibly, there are multiple angles at S. For example:

- ∠RSQ (as discussed earlier)

- ∠RST (part of the quadrilateral)

- Possibly others if there are other lines meeting at S.

Given that point A lies on line SQ and RT, then at point S, there's line SQ and possibly other lines. But the only angle at S mentioned in the problem is ∠RSQ.

Thus, it's most plausible that ∠S refers to ∠RSQ, which is 5x +4 = 34°, hence answer D.

But to double-check, let's ensure that there are no other interpretations.

Alternatively, if the diagram includes triangle SQT, where ∠SQT = 32°, and we need to find ∠S in that triangle. In triangle SQT, the angles are ∠SQT = 32°, and the other two angles are ∠QST and ∠QTS. But we don't have direct info about them. Unless we can find them through other means.

But if we can find arc ST = 64°, then ∠QST would intercept arc QT. Wait, ∠QST is at point S, between Q and T. So it intercepts arc QT. Therefore, measure of ∠QST = ½ arc QT. Similarly, ∠QTS intercepts arc QS.

But without knowing arc QT or arc QS, we can't determine those angles. However, if we can find arc QT, maybe using other information.

Earlier, we had arc ST = 64°, arc RQ = 68°. Let me try to find other arcs.

Assume the points are ordered R, S, T, Q on the circle. Then:

arc RS + arc ST + arc TQ + arc QR = 360°

We know arc ST = 64°, arc RQ = arc from R to Q, which in this ordering would be arc RQ passing through S and T, which is arc RS + arc ST + arc TQ. Wait, but arc RQ could also be the other arc, but usually, we take the smaller arc unless specified otherwise.

But if arc RQ = 68°, then that's the measure of the arc between R and Q not containing S and T. Wait, but if the points are ordered R, S, T, Q, then arc RQ that doesn't contain S and T would actually be the arc going the other way around the circle, which would be arc RQ passing through the opposite side. But this is getting too vague.

Alternatively, since arc RQ is 68°, and arc ST is 64°, and the total circle is 360°, then the sum of the remaining arcs would be 360 - 68 - 64 = 228°. These remaining arcs would be arc RS and arc TQ. But without more information, we can't determine individual measures.

But maybe using the fact that ∠RTQ = 34°, which intercepts arc RQ = 68°, as before. Then, in triangle RTQ, we have ∠RTQ = 34°, and if we can find other angles.

For instance, ∠TRQ intercepts arc TQ. Let me denote arc TQ as y. Then, ∠TRQ = ½y. Similarly, ∠TQR intercepts arc TR. But I don't know arc TR.

Alternatively, in triangle RTQ, sum of angles is 180°, so:

∠RTQ + ∠TRQ + ∠TQR = 180°

Which is 34° + (½ arc TQ) + (½ arc TR) = 180°

But arc TQ + arc TR = arc RQ? No, arc TQ plus arc TR would be arc TQ + arc TR, which depends on the positioning. This seems too vague.

But since I already derived x=6 and got ∠RSQ = 34°, which is a clean value matching option D, and there's no contradiction, I think that's the intended path.

Hence, the measure of ∠S, which is ∠RSQ, is 34°, so the answer is D.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by interpreting the given geometric setup and identifying key relationships among the points and angles.

---

### **Step 1: Understanding the Geometry**

We are told that:

- Points $ R, S, T, Q $ lie on a circle centered at $ C $ with radius 7.0.
- Point $ A $ lies on both lines $ SQ $ and $ RT $. This implies that $ A $ is the **intersection** of chords $ SQ $ and $ RT $ within the circle.
- The angles given involve:
  - $ \angle RSQ = 5x + 4 $
  - $ \angle SQT = 32^\circ $
  - $ \angle RTQ = 6x - 2 $

We are asked to find the **measure of $ \angle S $**, i.e., $ m\angle S $.

---

### **Step 2: Identifying the Angle at Point $ S $**

From the given data, the only angle explicitly defined at point $ S $ is:

$$
\angle RSQ = 5x + 4
$$

This is the angle at $ S $, between segments $ RS $ and $ SQ $. Since this angle is formed by two chords originating from point $ S $, it is an **inscribed angle** intercepting arc $ RQ $.

---

### **Step 3: Using Inscribed Angles to Find $ x $**

Both $ \angle RSQ $ and $ \angle RTQ $ are inscribed angles intercepting the **same arc** $ RQ $, because they are formed by chords starting at points $ S $ and $ T $ respectively, both ending at $ R $ and $ Q $.

As inscribed angles intercepting the same arc are **equal**, we set:

$$
5x + 4 = 6x - 2
$$

Solving:

$$
5x + 4 = 6x - 2 \\
4 + 2 = 6x - 5x \\
x = 6
$$

---

### **Step 4: Finding $ m\angle S $**

Substitute $ x = 6 $ into the expression for $ \angle RSQ $:

$$
m\angle S = \angle RSQ = 5x + 4 = 5(6) + 4 = 30 + 4 = 34^\circ
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

Thus, the measure of $ \angle S $ is:

$$
\boxed{34}
$$

Matching with the given answer choices, the correct selection is:

$$
\text{Final Answer: D}
$$
