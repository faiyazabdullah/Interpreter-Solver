MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a rhombus ABCD, and angle ABC is 70 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle 1, which is mentioned in the constraints. Let me try to visualize the figure first.

First, recalling that a rhombus has all sides equal, and opposite angles are equal. Also, adjacent angles are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. Since ABCD is a rhombus, AB equals BC equals CD equals DA. 

Given that angle ABC is 70 degrees. In a rhombus, consecutive angles are supplementary. So angle ABC and angle BCD are opposite angles and should be equal? Wait, no. Wait, in a rhombus, opposite angles are equal. Adjacent angles are supplementary. So angle at B (ABC) and angle at D (ADC) are opposite angles, so they should be equal. Then angle at A and angle at C would be equal as well. But since angle ABC is 70 degrees, then angle ADC is also 70 degrees. The other two angles, at A and C, would each be 180 - 70 = 110 degrees.

But how does angle 1 come into play here? The problem mentions points E such that point E lies on lines DB and CA. Wait, the constraints say PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(D, B)) and PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(C, A)). So point E is the intersection of diagonals DB and CA. Because in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other. Therefore, E is the intersection point of the diagonals AC and BD. 

So angle 1 is likely referring to an angle formed at point E. But the problem says MeasureOf(Angle(E, A, B)) equals MeasureOf(Angle 1). Wait, Angle(E, A, B) would be angle at point A between points E and B? Or maybe it's angle at point E? Wait, the notation Angle(E, A, B) usually means the angle at point A, with segments EA and AB. Wait, no. The standard notation for angle XYZ is the angle at point Y between points X and Z. So Angle(E, A, B) would be the angle at point A between points E and B. Wait, but E is connected to A? Let me think again.

Wait, the points involved: E is on diagonal DB and on diagonal AC. So diagonals intersect at E. So in a rhombus, diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, only in a square. Wait, in a rhombus, diagonals bisect the angles. They aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Yes, that's a property. So diagonals intersect at 90 degrees. So in this case, diagonals AC and BD intersect at point E, forming four right angles at E. Wait, but if that's true, then triangle AEB would be a right triangle? Wait, but angle at E would be 90 degrees. However, the problem states that MeasureOf(Angle(E, A, B)) equals MeasureOf(Angle 1). If that angle is at A, then maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation.

Alternatively, perhaps Angle(E, A, B) refers to angle at point E between points A and B. That is, angle AEB. Which would make sense because E is the intersection of diagonals. So angle AEB would be one of the angles formed at E. But in a rhombus, since diagonals are perpendicular, angle AEB would be 90 degrees. But then why is angle 1 being asked? Maybe there's more to it. Wait, but maybe the angle isn't at E but somewhere else. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The question says: "What is m∠1?" And the constraints mention that MeasureOf(Angle(E, A, B)) equals MeasureOf(Angle 1). So angle(E, A, B) is the same as angle at point A between E and B. Wait, but point E is on diagonals. Let me sketch mentally:

Rhombus ABCD with vertices labeled in order. So AB, BC, CD, DA are sides. Diagonals AC and BD intersect at E. So E is the midpoint of both diagonals. Now, angle(E, A, B): according to the notation, this would be angle at point A between points E and B. So vertex at A, with segments AE and AB. So that would be angle EAB. So angle between AE and AB at point A. Hmm. Let me think about that.

In rhombus ABCD, diagonals bisect the angles. So diagonal AC splits angle A into two equal parts. Similarly, diagonal BD splits angle B into two equal parts. Since angle ABC is 70 degrees, then angle ABD is half of that? Wait, angle ABC is at point B. So BD is splitting angle B into two equal angles. So angle ABD would be half of angle ABC. Wait, angle ABC is 70 degrees, so angle ABD is 35 degrees. Then, in triangle ABE, we might have some relations.

Wait, let me get back to angle EAB. Since diagonal AC splits angle A into two equal parts. What's the measure of angle A? Earlier, I thought that since angle ABC is 70 degrees, then angle BAD would be 180 - 70 = 110 degrees. Because consecutive angles in a rhombus are supplementary. So angle at A is 110 degrees. Therefore, diagonal AC splits angle A into two equal angles of 55 degrees each. So angle EAB would be half of angle A, which is 55 degrees. So angle EAB is 55 degrees. Therefore, if MeasureOf(Angle(E, A, B)) is equal to angle 1, then angle 1 is 55 degrees. Which would correspond to option B.

But wait, let me check again. Is angle EAB indeed half of angle A? Since diagonal AC bisects angle A. Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. Therefore, angle EAB is half of angle BAD. Since angle BAD is 110 degrees, then angle EAB is 55 degrees. Hence, angle 1 is 55 degrees. Therefore, the answer would be B.

But let me confirm once more. Let me go through steps again.

Step 1: ABCD is a rhombus. All sides equal, opposite angles equal, consecutive angles supplementary.

Step 2: Given angle ABC = 70 degrees. Therefore, angle ADC is also 70 degrees. Angles at A and C are each 180 - 70 = 110 degrees.

Step 3: Diagonals AC and BD intersect at E. In a rhombus, diagonals bisect the angles. So diagonal AC bisects angle A and angle C. Diagonal BD bisects angle B and angle D.

Therefore, angle EAB is half of angle A. Since angle A is 110 degrees, then angle EAB is 55 degrees. Therefore, angle(E, A, B) is 55 degrees, hence angle 1 is 55 degrees. So answer is B.

Alternatively, could angle 1 refer to another angle? For example, if angle 1 was referring to angle AED or something else. But based on the notation given, angle(E, A, B) is angle at A between E and B. So yes, that would be angle EAB. So 55 degrees. So answer is B.

Another way to verify: using coordinates. Suppose we assign coordinates to the rhombus. Let me try that.

Let me place point A at (0, 0). Since it's a rhombus, suppose side AB is along x-axis. Let’s assume AB length is 'a'. Let me take specific values for easier calculation. Let’s set AB = 1 unit. Let me consider angle at B is 70 degrees. Wait, but constructing coordinates might complicate. Alternatively, use vectors or trigonometry.

But maybe it's overkill. Since the logic seems consistent. Diagonals bisect angles. Therefore, angle EAB is half of angle A. Which is 55 degrees. So answer is B. So the correct choice is B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the measure of ∠1, we begin by analyzing the given geometric structure and applying key properties of a **rhombus**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Rhombus Properties

- All sides of a rhombus are equal in length.
- Opposite angles are equal.
- Consecutive angles are **supplementary**, i.e., their measures sum to $180^\circ$.
- The **diagonals** of a rhombus **bisect each other at right angles** and **bisect the angles** of the rhombus.

---

### Step 2: Use Given Information

We’re told that:
- $ABCD$ is a rhombus.
- $\angle ABC = 70^\circ$
  
From the properties of a rhombus:
- $\angle ABC$ and $\angle ADC$ are opposite angles → $\angle ADC = 70^\circ$
- $\angle BAD$ and $\angle BCD$ are the remaining pair of opposite angles.
- Since consecutive angles are supplementary:
  $$
  \angle BAD = 180^\circ - \angle ABC = 180^\circ - 70^\circ = 110^\circ
  $$

Thus, the angles of the rhombus are:
$$
\angle ABC = \angle ADC = 70^\circ,\quad \angle BAD = \angle BCD = 110^\circ
$$

---

### Step 3: Analyze the Role of Point $E$

It is given that:
- Point $E$ lies on both line $DB$ and line $CA$, i.e., $E$ is the **intersection of diagonals** $AC$ and $BD$.
- This makes $E$ the **center** of the rhombus.

Importantly, **diagonals of a rhombus bisect its angles**. Thus:
- Diagonal $AC$ bisects $\angle BAD$ and $\angle BCD$
- Diagonal $BD$ bisects $\angle ABC$ and $\angle ADC$

This implies:
- $\angle EAB = \frac{1}{2} \angle BAD = \frac{1}{2}(110^\circ) = 55^\circ$

---

### Step 4: Interpretation of $\angle 1$

The question asks for $m\angle 1$, and it's stated that:
$$
\text{MeasureOf(Angle(E, A, B))} = \text{MeasureOf(Angle 1)}
$$

By convention, $\angle(E, A, B)$ denotes the angle at **point A** formed by segments $EA$ and $AB$. That is, it represents:
$$
\angle EAB
$$

Since we’ve already computed:
$$
\angle EAB = 55^\circ
$$

Then:
$$
m\angle 1 = 55^\circ
$$

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{\text{B}}
$$

Final Answer: B
