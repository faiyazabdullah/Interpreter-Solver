MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have some points and circles involved. Let me start by restating the given information to make sure I understand it correctly.

First, the measure of angle GKH is 122 degrees. That means at point K, between points G and H, the angle formed is 122 degrees. Then there are several points lying on a circle centered at K with radius 0.0? Wait, maybe that's a typo? Because radius_0_0 might be a placeholder for a specific value, but since it's mentioned as radius_0_0, perhaps it's supposed to represent a unit circle or something else. But actually, the key thing here is that points L, H, J, G are all on the same circle centered at K. So, that makes sense. Since they're all on the circle with center K, so K is the center of the circle, and those points lie on its circumference.

Also, it says that GJ is a diameter of the circle K. Oh, right! So GJ is a diameter of the circle centered at K. Therefore, points G and J are endpoints of a diameter. That means that the distance between G and J is twice the radius of the circle. Also, since K is the center, then K is the midpoint of GJ. Wait, but the circle is centered at K, so yes, K is the center, so G and J are points on the circle such that the line segment GJ passes through K and has length equal to twice the radius.

Now, the question asks for the measure of arc GLJ. Wait, arc GLJ? Hmm. Arcs are named by their endpoints, so GLJ would be an arc starting at G, going through L, and ending at J? Or maybe it's the arc from G to J passing through L? But arcs can be major or minor depending on the context. However, since L is another point on the circle, we need to determine the measure of that particular arc.

But first, let me recall that when you have a circle, the measure of an arc corresponds to the central angle subtended by the arc. For example, if you have two points on a circle, the arc between them is equal to the measure of the central angle between them. So, if we can find the central angle corresponding to arc GLJ, then that would give us the measure of the arc.

Wait, but arc GLJ... So points G, L, J are all on the circle. So the arc from G to J that passes through L. But since L is another point on the circle, we need to see where L is located relative to G and J.

Given that L lies on the circle centered at K (since PointLiesOnCircle(L, Circle(K, radius_0_0))), so L is another point on the same circle as G, H, J. Also, H is also on the circle. The original angle given is angle GKH = 122 degrees. So angle at K between points G and H is 122 degrees. Since K is the center of the circle, that angle is a central angle, which means the measure of arc GH is equal to that angle. Therefore, arc GH measures 122 degrees.

So, arc GH is 122 degrees. Now, since GJ is a diameter, then points G and J are diametrically opposite each other on the circle. Therefore, the arc from G to J should be half the circle, which is 180 degrees. But wait, that's only if we take the shorter arc. However, since the problem mentions arc GLJ, which includes point L, so maybe the arc goes from G to J via L. So, depending on where L is located, the measure could vary.

But how do we find the measure of arc GLJ?

Let me think. First, since GJ is a diameter, the arc from G to J along the circle without passing through H would be 180 degrees. However, if L is somewhere else on the circle, then the arc GLJ would depend on the position of L.

But we know that H is on the circle as well. Given that angle GKH is 122 degrees, meaning that arc GH is 122 degrees. So, since GJ is a diameter, the entire semicircle from G to J is 180 degrees. If arc GH is 122 degrees, then the remaining part of the semicircle from H to J would be 180 - 122 = 58 degrees. Wait, no. Wait, because H is a point on the circle, but where exactly? Is H on the same semicircle as J? Let me visualize.

Imagine the circle with center K. Points G and J are endpoints of a diameter. So, if we draw line GJ, it splits the circle into two semicircles. Now, point H is somewhere on the circle such that angle GKH is 122 degrees. Since angle at the center, so that corresponds to arc GH being 122 degrees. Depending on which direction H is from G, either clockwise or counterclockwise.

Assuming standard positions, let's say we place point G at coordinates (r, 0) on a coordinate system with K at the origin. Then, since GJ is a diameter, point J would be at (-r, 0). The angle between KG and KH is 122 degrees. So, point H is located 122 degrees from point G around the circle. Depending on the direction, but typically angles in circles are measured in the positive (counterclockwise) direction unless specified otherwise.

Therefore, if we consider the arc from G to H is 122 degrees. Since the total semicircle from G to J is 180 degrees, then the arc from H to J would be 180 - 122 = 58 degrees. So, moving from G to H to J along the semicircle, the arc GH is 122°, and arc HJ is 58°.

But where does point L come into play? We know that L is also on the circle. The problem states that L lies on the circle centered at K, so L is another point on the circle. But we don't have direct information about where L is located. However, the question is asking for the measure of arc GLJ. So, arc GLJ would be the arc starting at G, passing through L, and ending at J. Therefore, the measure of that arc depends on the location of L.

But how do we determine where L is? Are there any constraints given about L besides lying on the circle? Let me check again.

The constraints given are:

- Angle GKH is 122 degrees.

- Point L lies on the circle centered at K.

- Points H, J, G are on the same circle (so they are all on the circle centered at K).

Wait, but there's no explicit constraint on point L except that it lies on the circle. So L could be anywhere on the circle. But then, how can we determine the measure of arc GLJ?

Wait, maybe there's more information. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:

Original constraints:

PointLiesOnLine(K, Line(G, J)) — Wait, hold on! There's a constraint that says PointLiesOnLine(K, Line(G, J)). Wait, that seems odd. Wait, the wording is confusing. Let me parse it again.

Original constraints:

PointLiesOnLine(K, Line(G, J)): This probably means that point K lies on the line defined by points G and J. But wait, K is the center of the circle, and G and J are points on the circle. So if GJ is a diameter, then K is the midpoint of GJ, so K is on the line GJ. So that makes sense. So that's just confirming that K is on line GJ, which is already implied by GJ being a diameter. So that constraint is redundant but confirms that K is on line GJ.

Then, the other constraints are that points L, H, J, G lie on the circle centered at K. So, all these points are on the circle with center K. So, that's clear.

But how does point L relate to the rest? The problem is asking for the measure of arc GLJ. So, arc GLJ is the arc from G to J passing through L. But since L is arbitrary on the circle, unless there's more constraints. Wait, but maybe there's more information?

Wait, maybe there's a missing constraint? Let me check again.

Looking back:

Original problem says:

PointLiesOnCircle(L, Circle(K, radius_0_0))

So, L is on the circle. But no other constraints on L. Unless there's an implicit assumption based on other constraints?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a diagram that's referenced, but since we don't have a diagram, we have to rely solely on the text.

Wait, but the problem gives angle GKH = 122 degrees, and points H, J, G are on the circle. Maybe point L is related to H? Not directly stated.

Wait, but the problem is asking for arc GLJ. So, regardless of where L is, but since L is on the circle, maybe we need to use some relationship.

Wait, but without knowing where L is, how can we compute the measure of arc GLJ? Unless there's more constraints. Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.

Wait, maybe the problem is referring to a specific arc. Wait, perhaps the arc GLJ is meant to be the arc that contains point H? Or maybe there's a misinterpretation here.

Alternatively, maybe the arc GLJ refers to the arc from G to J passing through L, which is determined by the position of L. But since L is not fixed, unless there's a relation between L and other points.

Wait, but maybe there's more information. Let me check again.

Wait, the problem says "PointLiesOnLine(K, Line(G, J))". Wait, that was already covered. And the other constraints are that L, H, J, G are on the circle. So, maybe L is another point on the circle, but not necessarily connected to other points except being on the circle.

Hmm, but then how can we find the measure of arc GLJ? It seems like we need more information. Unless there's something I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps there's a property involving angles subtended by arcs? For instance, maybe triangle GLJ or something similar.

Alternatively, maybe the measure of arc GLJ is related to the angle at K? Wait, but angle GKH is given as 122 degrees. If we can relate angle GKL or something else.

Wait, but we don't know where L is. Unless there's a way to express the arc GLJ in terms of known quantities.

Wait, maybe the problem assumes that L is the intersection of some lines? Like, maybe KL is perpendicular to something?

Wait, but there's no mention of that. Alternatively, since L is on the circle, and GJ is a diameter, maybe there's a property about inscribed angles or something else.

Wait, another thought: if we can find the measure of arc GLJ, which is from G to J through L. Since GJ is a diameter, the arc from G to J is 180 degrees. But if L is somewhere on the circle, then depending on where L is, the arc GLJ could be larger than 180 degrees or smaller. Wait, but the problem might be considering the minor arc or major arc. But since it's called arc GLJ, which implies that it's passing through L, so the arc that starts at G, goes through L, and ends at J. Therefore, the measure of that arc would be the sum of arc GL plus arc LJ.

But without knowing where L is, how can we calculate that?

Wait, maybe there's a connection between L and the given angle. Let me think again.

We have angle GKH = 122 degrees. Since H is on the circle, and K is the center. So, that angle is a central angle for arc GH. So, arc GH is 122 degrees. As before.

If we can relate point L to this. Suppose that L is another point on the circle. But unless there's more info, we cannot assume anything about L. Wait, but the problem must have enough info to solve it. So maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, maybe there's a misinterpretation of the question. The problem says "Find m∠GLJ." Wait, no, the question says "m ∠GLJ"? Wait, no, the original question says "Find m ∠GLJ." Wait, no, the user wrote:

"Find m \widehat G L J."

Ah! The notation \widehat{GLJ} represents the measure of the arc GLJ. So, it's an arc, not an angle. So, the measure of arc GLJ. Which is different from angle GLJ. So, the arc from G to J passing through L.

Since GJ is a diameter, the arc from G to J is 180 degrees. But if L is a point on the circle, then depending on where L is, the arc GLJ could be the same as the semicircle, or a different arc. But how?

Wait, but if L is on the circle, then the arc from G to J through L would be either the minor arc or major arc. However, since it's specified as GLJ, implying that it's the arc that passes through L, which could be either side.

But without knowing where L is, how can we determine this?

Wait, but maybe there's a relationship between L and other points. For example, if L is the same as H? But no, because H is already on the circle. Wait, but the problem lists multiple points on the circle: L, H, J, G. So, L could be H, but that's not indicated.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using L as another point, but since there's no further constraints, maybe there's a standard configuration.

Wait, but maybe the arc GLJ is the same as arc GJ, which is 180 degrees. But that would mean that L is on the arc GJ, making it pass through L, but since L is arbitrary, it could be anywhere. However, if the problem expects a unique answer, there must be more constraints.

Wait, perhaps there's a misread. Let me check the original problem again.

The problem says:

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC CONSTRAINTS:
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(G, K, H)), 122)
PointLiesOnLine(K, Line(G, J))
PointLiesOnCircle(L, Circle(K, radius_0_0))
PointLiesOnCircle(H, Circle(K, radius_0_0))
PointLiesOnCircle(J, Circle(K, radius_0_0))
PointLiesOnCircle(G, Circle(K, radius_0_0))

QUESTION:
G J is a diameter of ⊙K. Find m ∠GLJ."

Wait, wait! Wait, I think I misread the question earlier. The question is asking for m∠GLJ, not the arc GLJ. Wait, but the user initially said:

"Find m \widehat G L J."

But in the problem statement, the question is written as "Find m ∠GLJ", but the initial description had "\widehat G L J". Wait, there might be confusion here. Let me check again.

Looking back at the user's message:

"QUESTION:
G J is a diameter of ⊙K. Find m \widehat G L J."

Yes, the question is about the measure of arc GLJ, denoted by the hat symbol. So, it's an arc, not an angle. But earlier, I thought it was an angle. So, the user wrote \widehat{GLJ}, which denotes an arc.

So, arc GLJ. So, the arc from G to J passing through L. Since GJ is a diameter, which is 180 degrees, but if L is a point on the circle, then the arc GLJ depends on where L is.

But how can we determine the measure? There must be some missing piece of information.

Wait, but the problem gives that angle GKH is 122 degrees. Since K is the center, that angle relates to arc GH. So, arc GH is 122 degrees. Since GJ is a diameter, then arc GJ is 180 degrees. If we can find where L is, maybe in relation to H or other points?

Wait, but unless there's a connection between L and H, or another point. But the only other points are J and G. Wait, but we don't have any constraints on L except that it's on the circle.

Unless there's a property I'm missing. For example, if L is the midpoint of some arc, or something else.

Wait, but since the problem provides that angle GKH is 122 degrees, and points H, J, G are on the circle, maybe L is a point such that KL is perpendicular to something, or forms a certain angle.

Alternatively, maybe the arc GLJ is composed of arc GL + arc LJ. If we can find those arcs.

But without knowing where L is, we can't determine this. So, there must be something wrong in my understanding.

Wait, maybe the problem has a typo and L is supposed to be H? Or maybe there's a missing constraint.

Wait, looking at the given constraints again:

PointLiesOnLine(K, Line(G, J)) – which we've established is redundant.

PointLiesOnCircle(L, Circle(K, ...)) – L is on the circle.

But maybe there's a missing constraint that L is the foot of some perpendicular or something. But no, there isn't.

Wait, but perhaps the fact that L is on the circle and the other points, combined with the given angle, allows us to infer something about the position of L?

For example, suppose that we have points G and J as endpoints of a diameter, and H is a point on the circle such that angle GKH is 122 degrees. Now, what if L is another point on the circle? How does that affect the arc GLJ?

Wait, unless the problem is asking for the measure of arc GLJ, which is the same as arc GJ, which is 180 degrees. But that would be true regardless of where L is, as long as L is on the arc GJ. But if L is on the opposite arc, then the measure would be 360 - 180 = 180, still. Wait, no. Wait, if the arc GLJ passes through L, then depending on where L is, it could be the minor or major arc. But since GJ is a diameter, the arc GJ is always 180 degrees, so regardless of where L is, the arc GLJ would be 180 degrees, because it's the same as arc GJ. But that can't be right, because if L is not on arc GJ, then the arc GLJ would be the major arc, which would be greater than 180 degrees.

But the problem must have a unique answer, so there must be a specific value. Therefore, perhaps there is additional information that I'm missing.

Wait, let me re-express the problem with all given data:

- K is the center of the circle.

- G and J are endpoints of a diameter, so GK = KJ, and GJ is a straight line passing through K.

- H is a point on the circle such that angle GKH = 122 degrees. Thus, arc GH = 122 degrees.

- L is another point on the circle.

- The question is to find the measure of arc GLJ, i.e., the arc from G to J passing through L.

But since L is arbitrary, how can we determine this measure?

Wait, unless there's a specific position for L based on other constraints. Let me think: Could there be a relation between L and other points?

Wait, the problem says PointLiesOnLine(K, Line(G, J))? No, that's already satisfied since K is on line GJ. But what about L? Is there any other condition on L?

No, the only constraint is that L lies on the circle. So, unless there's a hidden constraint, like L being the midpoint of arc GJ or something. But that's not given.

Wait, but maybe the measure of arc GLJ is equal to the measure of arc GJ plus or minus something. But without knowing where L is, I can't tell.

Wait, but maybe the problem is referring to the arc GLJ as the arc that contains H? Since H is another point on the circle. Let's explore that possibility.

Suppose that arc GLJ is the arc that goes from G to J passing through H. In that case, the measure of arc GLJ would be the measure of arc GH plus arc HJ.

Earlier, we said that arc GH is 122 degrees, and since GJ is a diameter, arc GJ is 180 degrees. So, arc HJ would be 180 - 122 = 58 degrees. Hence, the total measure of arc GLJ (passing through H) would be 122 + 58 = 180 degrees. But that's the same as arc GJ. So, that would imply that the measure is 180 degrees, which is option C. But why would L be H in this case?

Wait, but the problem says that L is a point on the circle, and H is also a point on the circle. So, maybe L is H? But that's not stated. Unless there's a reason to believe that L is H. 

But why would the problem include L as a separate point if it's the same as H? Perhaps there's a miscommunication. Alternatively, perhaps the arc GLJ is intended to be the arc from G to J that passes through L, and since L is not specified, but there's another condition, like the angle at K.

Wait, but angle at K is given as 122 degrees, relating to H. If L is another point, maybe there's an angle involving L?

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the measure of arc GLJ, which is the same as arc GJ, hence 180 degrees. So, even though L is arbitrary, the measure would still be 180 degrees. But that seems too straightforward, and option C is 180.

Alternatively, maybe there's a calculation involving the angle at K. For example, if we consider triangle GLK or something. But without knowing where L is, it's hard to say.

Wait, another approach: Since L is on the circle, and GJ is a diameter, then the measure of arc GLJ is equal to the measure of arc GJ, which is 180 degrees, regardless of where L is, as long as it's on the circle. Because the arc from G to J is always 180 degrees, and adding L on the arc doesn't change the measure. Wait, no. If L is on the arc GJ, then the arc GLJ is still 180 degrees. If L is not on arc GJ, then it would be the major arc, which would be 360 - 180 = 180. Wait, no, the major arc would be 360 - 180 = 180? No, that can't be. Wait, the full circle is 360 degrees. The minor arc GJ is 180 degrees, so the major arc GJ would be 360 - 180 = 180 degrees? That can't be. Wait, no. If GJ is a diameter, then the minor arc GJ is 180 degrees, and the major arc GJ would also be 180 degrees? That's impossible. Wait, no, the major arc would be the longer path, but since GJ is a diameter, both arcs GJ are semicircles. So, the arc GLJ, whether it goes through L on one side or the other, is still 180 degrees. So, regardless of where L is, as long as it's on the circle, the arc GLJ would be 180 degrees. But then why is the given angle GKH = 122 degrees? It seems irrelevant. 

This suggests that there's either a misunderstanding of the problem or a missing constraint. But since the problem is from a test, it must have a solution. Let me try to think differently.

Maybe the arc GLJ is not the arc GJ, but the arc from G to J passing through L, where L is determined by some other condition. Wait, but what condition?

Wait, maybe there's an error in interpreting the constraints. Let me go back to the original constraints:

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(G, K, H)), 122): This means angle at K between points G and H is 122 degrees.

- PointLiesOnLine(K, Line(G, J)): K is on line GJ, which is already implied.

- PointLiesOnCircle(L, Circle(K, radius_0_0)): L is on the circle.

- PointLiesOnCircle(H, Circle(K, radius_0_0)): H is on the circle.

- PointLiesOnCircle(J, Circle(K, radius_0_0)): J is on the circle.

- PointLiesOnCircle(G, Circle(K, radius_0_0)): G is on the circle.

Wait, but if GJ is a diameter, then G and J are endpoints of a diameter, so the circle has diameter GJ. Hence, the radius is half of GJ. But the exact length isn't important.

Now, if we consider the position of H, which is on the circle, forming a 122-degree angle at K. So, H is somewhere on the circle, creating arc GH of 122 degrees. Now, if we consider the arc GLJ, which is the arc from G to J passing through L. If L is chosen such that it's aligned with H, then the arc would be 122 degrees plus something. But without knowing where L is, it's unclear.

Wait, but maybe the arc GLJ is the same as arc GHJ? Or some combination. Let me think about the possible arcs.

Wait, if L is H, then arc GLJ would be arc GHJ, which would be arc GH (122 degrees) plus arc HJ. Since arc GJ is 180 degrees, arc HJ is 180 - 122 = 58 degrees. So, total arc GHJ is 122 + 58 = 180 degrees, which is the same as arc GJ. So, again, it's 180 degrees.

But if L is not H, but another point, say, directly opposite to H, then the arc GLJ would be different. But since there's no info, it's impossible to determine.

Wait, but maybe the problem is asking for the measure of arc GLJ, which is the same as arc GJ, which is 180 degrees. Hence, the answer is C. But why is the given angle GKH = 122 degrees? It seems unrelated. Perhaps it's a red herring, or perhaps there's a misinterpretation.

Alternatively, maybe the arc GLJ is referring to the arc that includes point H, and the measure is calculated based on that. For example, if L is such that KL is perpendicular to something, but without more info, it's hard to say.

Wait, but if we consider that angle GKH is 122 degrees, and GJ is a diameter, then maybe there's a relationship between L and H? For example, if L is the reflection of H over the diameter GJ, or something like that. But again, without explicit info, it's speculation.

Another thought: Since GJ is a diameter, and H is a point on the circle, then the angle at H, subtended by GJ, would be a right angle. Wait, by Thales' theorem, any angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle. So, if we consider triangle GHJ, since GJ is a diameter, then angle at H would be 90 degrees. But how does that help?

But the problem is about arc GLJ. If L is a point such that HL is perpendicular to something, but again, no info.

Wait, but if we assume that L is H, then the arc GLJ would be arc GJ, which is 180 degrees. But why would L be H? Because the problem mentions L as a point on the circle, but H is also a point on the circle. Maybe there's a typo and L is supposed to be H? If that's the case, then the measure is 180 degrees, option C.

Alternatively, maybe the arc GLJ is meant to be the arc from G to J through L, where L is such that angle GLJ is 122 degrees. But that would be an angle, not an arc.

Wait, the problem says "Find m ∠GLJ." Wait, no, originally it was about arc GLJ, but maybe there was a mix-up. Let me double-check.

In the original problem statement, the user wrote:

"Find m \widehat G L J."

Which is the measure of arc GLJ. But if the actual question is about the measure of angle GLJ, that would change everything. Let me check.

If it were angle GLJ, then we'd have to find the measure of angle at L between points G and J. In that case, using the inscribed angle theorem, since GJ is a diameter, angle GLJ would be an inscribed angle subtending arc GJ. But since GJ is a diameter, the inscribed angle subtending it would be 90 degrees. But that's only if L is on the circle. Wait, but angle GLJ would be an inscribed angle subtending arc GJ, so its measure would be half of the arc GJ. Since arc GJ is 180 degrees, the angle would be 90 degrees. So, answer A.

But why would the problem give angle GKH = 122 degrees? It wouldn't be relevant if the question is about angle GLJ. So, this suggests that there might be a mix-up between arc and angle.

Given that the initial problem statement has conflicting possibilities, but since the user included the arc notation, I'll proceed under the assumption that it's asking for the arc measure.

However, given the confusion, let me try to resolve it.

If the question is about the arc measure, and given that GJ is a diameter, then the arc GJ is 180 degrees. If L is on the circle, then the arc GLJ is either the minor arc GJ (180 degrees) or the major arc GJ (which would be 180 degrees as well, since the total circle is 360). Wait, no, the major arc would be 360 - 180 = 180. Wait, that can't be. Wait, no. If GJ is a diameter, then the arc GJ is 180 degrees, and the arc GJ going the other way is also 180 degrees. So, any arc from G to J is 180 degrees. Hence, regardless of where L is, the arc GLJ would be 180 degrees. Hence, answer C.

But then why is the given angle GKH = 122 degrees? It seems irrelevant. This suggests that either the problem is flawed, or there's a misinterpretation.

Alternatively, if the question is about angle GLJ, then using the inscribed angle theorem, angle GLJ would be half the measure of the arc GJ, which is 90 degrees, so answer A.

But why is angle GKH given as 122 degrees? It would be relevant if the question is about angle GLJ. For example, if L is positioned such that it creates a relationship with H. Let me explore this.

Assume the question is about angle GLJ. Let's try to find it.

Given that GJ is a diameter, and L is a point on the circle. Then, angle GLJ is an inscribed angle subtending arc GJ. Wait, no. Inscribed angle subtends arc opposite to it. So, angle at L between G and J subtends arc GJ. Since GJ is a diameter, arc GJ is 180 degrees, so the inscribed angle would be 90 degrees. So, angle GLJ is 90 degrees, answer A.

But why is the given angle GKH = 122 degrees? It doesn't seem related. Unless there's a connection between L and H.

Wait, if L is the same as H, then angle GLJ would be angle GHJ. Let's see: If L is H, then angle GLJ is angle GHJ. Let's calculate that.

Since GJ is a diameter, and H is on the circle, then triangle GHJ is a right triangle at H (Thales' theorem), so angle at H is 90 degrees. So, angle GHJ is 90 degrees. So, if L is H, then angle GLJ is 90 degrees. Hence, answer A.

But the problem states that L is a point on the circle, but it doesn't say it's H. However, given that the problem includes H as a point on the circle, and the given angle involves H, it's possible that the question intends L to be H, even though it's not explicitly stated. This would make the measure of angle GLJ as 90 degrees, option A.

But why would the problem include H and L as separate points? It's possible that there was a formatting issue, and L was meant to be H. Alternatively, the problem may have a typo.

Considering that, and the presence of angle GKH = 122 degrees, which might be a distractor if the question is about angle GLJ, but if it's about arc GLJ, then it's irrelevant.

Given the ambiguity, but assuming that the question is about angle GLJ (possibly due to a formatting error), and given that angle GLJ would be 90 degrees, I would choose option A. However, if it's about arc GLJ, the answer is C.

But since the original problem specifies the arc measure, and the given angle GKH is 122 degrees, which might be used in calculating something else, but I can't see how. This suggests that there's likely a misinterpretation.

Wait, let's try another approach. Let's assume the question is about the arc GLJ, and there's a way to relate it to the given angle.

Since angle GKH is 122 degrees, which is a central angle, and GJ is a diameter. If we can find the measure of arc GLJ in terms of this angle.

Let me imagine the circle with center K, G and J as endpoints of diameter. Point H is such that arc GH is 122 degrees. Now, if L is a point on the circle, and we want to find arc GLJ.

But unless there's a specific relationship between L and other points, it's impossible. However, if L is such that it forms a specific angle with other points, but since no info is given, it's unclear.

Wait, but the problem says PointLiesOnCircle(L, Circle(K, radius_0_0)), and other points. Maybe there's a standard configuration where L is placed such that it forms a specific angle?

Alternatively, perhaps the measure of arc GLJ is equal to 2 times angle GKH? 2*122=244, which is not among the choices. Or 180-122=58, which is not in the choices. Or 122+something.

Alternatively, since arc GH is 122 degrees, and if arc GLJ is the arc from G to J passing through L, and if L is such that it's on the extension of HK, or something.

Wait, let me try to visualize. Assume the circle with center K. G and J are endpoints of diameter. H is a point on the circle such that arc GH is 122 degrees. Now, if we extend KH to meet the circle again at L, then L would be the point diametrically opposite to H. Wait, but extending KH from K through H would reach the opposite side of the circle. But since K is the center, extending KH would go through H to the opposite side, which would be a point L such that KL is a diameter. But since GJ is already a diameter, unless H is aligned with G or J.

Wait, but if we extend KH to the other side of the circle, then L would be the diametrically opposite point to H. Let's call that point L. So, KL is a diameter, passing through H. So, arc HL would be 180 degrees. But how does this relate to arc GLJ?

If L is the diametrically opposite point to H, then the arc from G to J passing through L would depend on the position of H.

Let me try to calculate. Let's say arc GH is 122 degrees. Since K is the center, and GJ is a diameter, then arc GJ is 180 degrees. If we extend KH to L, then arc HL is 180 degrees, so arc from H to L is 180 degrees. So, arc GL would be arc GH + arc HL, but wait, no. If L is diametrically opposite to H, then arc from G to L would be arc GH + arc HL, but depending on direction.

Wait, let's assign positions. Let me place the circle with center K at the origin. Let's set up coordinates: let G be at (1, 0), J at (-1, 0), so GJ is the x-axis, diameter. Point H is on the circle such that angle GKH is 122 degrees. So, the angle between KG and KH is 122 degrees. So, if KG is along the positive x-axis, then KH is at 122 degrees from KG. So, point H has coordinates (cos(122°), sin(122°)).

Now, extending KH to the other side of the circle would reach point L, which is diametrically opposite to H. So, since H is at angle 122°, then L would be at angle 122° + 180° = 302°. So, point L is at 302°.

Now, we need to find the measure of arc GLJ, which is the arc from G (at 0°) to J (at 180°) passing through L (at 302°). Wait, but L is at 302°, which is in the fourth quadrant. To go from G (0°) to J (180°) passing through L (302°), we need to go from G (0°) to L (302°) and then to J (180°)? Wait, but that doesn't make sense because 302° is closer to 0° than to 180°.

Wait, maybe the arc GLJ is the arc from G to J passing through L, which is at 302°. So, starting at G (0°), going through L (302°), and ending at J (180°). But how does that work? From G (0°), going clockwise to L (302°), then continuing to J (180°)? Wait, but 302° is between 270° and 360°, while J is at 180°. So, going from G (0°) to L (302°) to J (180°) would require going clockwise from G to L, then counterclockwise to J? That doesn't form a continuous arc.

Alternatively, perhaps the arc GLJ is the arc from G to J that passes through L, which is at 302°. To find the measure of this arc, we need to calculate the angular distance from G to L to J.

From G (0°) to L (302°) is 302° - 0° = 302°, but since we're dealing with arcs, it's the smallest angle. Wait, no. The arc from G to L is the shorter arc or longer arc? Depends on the direction. But since we're going from G to J through L, it would be the arc that goes from G to L to J, which would be the major arc if L is on the opposite side.

Wait, let me calculate the measure of the arc from G to J passing through L. Since L is at 302°, which is in the fourth quadrant. The arc from G (0°) to J (180°) passing through L would go from G (0°) → L (302°) → J (180°)? Wait, but 302° is not between G and J. This suggests that the arc GLJ would actually be the major arc GJ passing through L, which would be 360° - 180° = 180°, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, this indicates that my assumption about L being the diametrically opposite point to H is incorrect, or that the arc GLJ is not passing through L in this configuration.

Alternatively, if L is at 302°, then the arc from G to J passing through L would be the arc from G (0°) to L (302°) to J (180°). But this path would go from G (0°) clockwise to L (302°), then continue clockwise to J (180°)? Wait, but 302° is closer to 360°, and J is at 180°, so going from L (302°) to J (180°) would require going counterclockwise, which would be a large arc. The total measure would be the angle from G to L (302°) plus the angle from L to J (180° - 302° + 360°)? Wait, this is getting complicated.

Let me calculate the measure of the arc from G to J passing through L. The total measure is the sum of the arc from G to L and from L to J.

If L is at 302°, then the arc from G (0°) to L (302°) is 302° - 0° = 302°, but since arcs are measured as the smaller or larger arc, but in this case, since we're going from G to J through L, it would be the larger arc. Wait, no, the measure of the arc from G to J passing through L is the sum of the arcs from G to L and L to J. But since L is on the circle, the total would depend on the position.

Alternatively, the measure of the arc GLJ is equal to the measure of the central angle subtended by arc GLJ. Since GJ is a diameter, and L is some point on the circle, the central angle for arc GLJ would be the angle from G to J passing through L. But since GJ is a diameter, the central angle is 180°, so the measure of arc GLJ is 180°, regardless of where L is. Hence, the answer is C.

This brings us back to the conclusion that the measure is 180 degrees, option C. Despite the given angle of 122 degrees, it might be irrelevant, or possibly a red herring. This is possible in some problems where extra information is provided to test attention.

Given that, and the lack of other clues, I will conclude that the measure of arc GLJ is 180 degrees, so the answer is C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the geometric setup and applying fundamental circle theorems.

### **Step 1: Understand the Configuration**

We are told:

- $ GJ $ is a **diameter** of the circle centered at $ K $.  
- Points $ G $, $ J $, $ H $, $ L $, and $ K $ all lie on the same circle with center $ K $.  
- The measure of angle $ \angle GKH = 122^\circ $.  
- We are asked to find the measure of the arc $ \widehat{GLJ} $, i.e., the arc from $ G $ to $ J $ that passes through point $ L $.

---

### **Step 2: Key Observations**

#### **a) Diameter and Central Angles**
Since $ GJ $ is a diameter, the angle $ \angle GKH $ is a **central angle**, and thus, it corresponds directly to the **measure of arc $ GH $**.

$$
\text{Measure of } \angle GKH = \text{Measure of arc } GH = 122^\circ
$$

#### **b) Total Measure of Semicircle**
Because $ GJ $ is a diameter, the arc $ GJ $ spans a semicircle:

$$
\text{Measure of arc } GJ = 180^\circ
$$

#### **c) Position of Point $ L $**
Although the problem does not specify where $ L $ lies on the circle, it simply states that $ L $ lies on the circle centered at $ K $. Importantly, the arc $ \widehat{GLJ} $ is defined as the arc from $ G $ to $ J $ that **passes through** $ L $. Regardless of where $ L $ is on the circle (as long as it’s on the circle), the arc $ \widehat{GLJ} $ is **always** the same as the arc $ GJ $, because $ GJ $ is a diameter, and any arc connecting $ G $ and $ J $ through any third point on the circle will span the same semicircular arc.

Thus,

$$
\text{Measure of } \widehat{GLJ} = \text{Measure of arc } GJ = 180^\circ
$$

---

### **Conclusion**

The measure of arc $ \widehat{GLJ} $ is the same as the measure of arc $ GJ $, which is a semicircle. Therefore, the final answer is:

$$
\boxed{\text{Final Answer: C}}
