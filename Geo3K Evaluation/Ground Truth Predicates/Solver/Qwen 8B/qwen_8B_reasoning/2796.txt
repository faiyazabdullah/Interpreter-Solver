MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given information carefully. Let me start by listing out all the constraints provided:

1. The measure of arc XY (I think it's arc from X to Y passing through B?) is 96 degrees. Wait, the notation MeasureOf(Arc(X, B, Y)) – so that would be the arc between points X and Y with center at point B? Or maybe the arc from X to Y with B as a point on the arc? Hmm, but usually arcs are defined by two endpoints and sometimes a third point indicating direction. But since there's a circle involved here, maybe B is the center?

Wait, looking further down, there are several points lying on circles centered at B with radius 5.0. So Points X, Y, Z are all on Circle B. Therefore, B is likely the center of the circle. So the arc from X to Y passing through B? Wait, no. If B is the center, then an arc from X to Y would be part of the circumference of the circle centered at B. However, the arc measure is given as 96 degrees. So the arc XY (with center B) measures 96 degrees. That means that angle at the center subtended by arc XY is 96 degrees. So the central angle for arc XY is 96°, which implies that ∠XBY = 96°, because B is the center.

Then, we have another constraint: MeasureOf(Angle(X, W, Y)) is 49 degrees. So Angle at point W between points X and Y is 49°. So ∠XWY = 49°. 

Now, the rest of the constraints involve various points lying on lines and circles. Let me note them:

- Point X lies on line ZW. So X is somewhere on the line connecting Z and W.
- Point Y lies on line WA. So Y is on the line connecting W and A.
- Point Z lies on line WC. So Z is on the line connecting W and C.
- Also, X lies on line WC. Wait, earlier said X lies on line ZW, and also on line WC? Because "PointLiesOnLine(X, Line(W, C))". So X is on line WC. Similarly, Z is on line WC. So points Z and X are both on line WC. Therefore, line WC contains points Z and X. Then, since X is also on line ZW (which is same as line WC?), because ZW is the same line as WC. So that makes sense.

Also, Z lies on line XC. Wait, "PointLiesOnLine(Z, Line(X, C))" – so Z is on line XC. Wait, but earlier Z was on line WC. So point Z is on both line WC and line XC. Therefore, point Z is the intersection of lines WC and XC. But since X is already on line WC, then line XC is the same as line WC? Wait, if X is on line WC, then line XC would be the same as line WC only if C is on line WC. Wait, perhaps C is another point on line WC?

This seems a bit confusing. Maybe I should draw a rough sketch mentally. Let me try to visualize the configuration.

Let me summarize the key points:

- All points X, Y, Z lie on the circle centered at B with radius 5.0. So they are all on the same circle with center B. Therefore, triangle XYZ is inscribed in circle B.

But wait, points X, Y, Z are all on the circle with center B. Therefore, B is the center, so the distances from B to each of these points is equal to the radius, which is 5.0 units.

So, for instance, BX = BY = BZ = 5.0.

Now, considering the first arc measure: Arc(X, B, Y) is 96 degrees. Since B is the center, that arc would correspond to the central angle ∠XBY = 96°, so that the arc length is 96°, meaning that the angle at the center between points X and Y is 96°. Therefore, the arc XY (the minor arc) is 96°, unless specified otherwise. So that gives us that ∠XBY = 96°.

Next, the angle ∠XWY is 49°. This angle is formed at point W, with segments WX and WY. Now, points X and Y are on the circle centered at B. Also, we know that points X and Y lie on certain lines. For example, point X lies on line ZW and line WC (since X is on line WC). Point Y lies on line WA. Point Z lies on line WC and line XC. 

Hmm, maybe I need to figure out the positions of points W, C, A relative to the circle centered at B. Let me see.

First, since point Z lies on line WC and on line XC. Since X is on line WC, then line XC passes through X and C. So point Z is on line XC. Therefore, line XC connects points X and C, and point Z is somewhere along that line. Also, since Z is on line WC (from earlier), which connects points W and C. Therefore, line WC connects W and C, and point Z is on that line. So line WC connects W to C, and point Z is on that line. Additionally, point Z is also on line XC. Therefore, line XC intersects line WC at point Z. So that suggests that lines XC and WC intersect at Z. Therefore, points X, Z, and C are colinear. So C is a point such that when you connect X to C, it passes through Z, which is also on line WC. Hence, C is a point connected to both X and W via lines WC and XC.

Similarly, point Y is on line WA. So line WA connects W to A, and Y is somewhere on that line. Also, point Y is on the circle centered at B. 

Additionally, point X is on line ZW (so line connecting Z and W) and on line WC. So X is on line WC, which connects W and C. Therefore, X is a point on line WC. Similarly, Z is also on line WC. Therefore, points W, Z, X, and C are colinear in some order? Depending on their positions.

But without knowing exact positions, maybe I can find relations using angles and arcs.

The question asks for the measure of arc YXZ. Wait, the notation m∠YXZ? Wait, no, the question says m widehat YXZ. In geometry, the notation m\widehat{YXZ} typically refers to the measure of the arc YXZ. Wait, but arcs are named by their endpoints, sometimes with a middle point indicating direction. However, since Y, X, Z are points on the circle, the arc from Y to Z passing through X? Or is it the arc YXZ as in starting at Y, going through X, ending at Z? Alternatively, could it be the arc YXZ as in the arc that goes from Y to Z with X being a point on the arc? Or maybe the arc YXZ is just the arc YZ, but with X on it? Wait, the notation might vary depending on context. But given that the answer is an angle measure, but the problem mentions arc measures earlier.

Wait, the initial given was MeasureOf(Arc(X, B, Y)) = 96. So that arc is from X to Y passing through B? But since B is the center, that's not possible because an arc cannot pass through the center unless it's a semicircle. Wait, maybe the notation Arc(X, B, Y) indicates that the arc is from X to Y with the center at B? No, that doesn't make sense. Usually, arcs are determined by two endpoints and sometimes a third point to indicate the arc's position. If B is the center, then the arc XY would be the arc from X to Y on the circle, and the measure would be the central angle. But how does the presence of B fit into that notation?

Alternatively, perhaps Arc(X, B, Y) is referring to the arc from X to Y that passes through B? But if B is the center, then that arc would have to go through the center, which would mean it's a diameter. But the measure of that arc would be 180 degrees if it were a straight line through the center. But the measure given here is 96 degrees, which isn't 180. Therefore, that interpretation may not hold.

Alternatively, maybe the notation Arc(X, B, Y) is meant to denote the arc whose center is B, hence implying that B is the center of the circle containing the arc. So the arc XY (on circle centered at B) has measure 96 degrees. So that confirms that ∠XBY = 96°, since the central angle over arc XY is 96 degrees.

Therefore, moving forward with that understanding.

Now, the question is asking for m\widehat{YXZ}. Assuming that this is the measure of the arc YXZ, which would be the arc from Y to Z passing through X. Wait, but if Y, X, Z are all points on the circle centered at B, then the arc YXZ would be the arc from Y to Z that passes through X. So the measure of that arc would depend on the positions of these points.

Alternatively, maybe it's the measure of the angle at point X between points Y and Z? Wait, but the notation m\widehat{YXZ} usually denotes the arc, not the angle. However, sometimes in problems, people use notation like that for angles. But given that the previous measure was an arc measure, it's more likely that the question wants the arc measure. But to confirm, let me check.

If it's an arc measure, then we need to find the measure of arc YXZ, i.e., the arc from Y to Z passing through X. To compute this, we need to know the total degree measure of that arc. Since the entire circle is 360 degrees, if we can find the measure of the arc YXZ, it would be equal to the sum of arcs YX and XZ, or something similar.

Alternatively, if the question is about the measure of angle YXZ, that would be different. But given that the initial data includes arc measures, it's safer to assume that the question is about an arc measure.

However, the problem statement says "Find the measure of m \widehat{YXZ}". In standard notation, the arc YXZ would be the arc starting at Y, going through X, and ending at Z. So that would be the arc YZ that passes through X. Therefore, its measure is the sum of the arcs from Y to X and X to Z. But we need to determine that measure.

To find this, we need to relate the known arcs and angles. Let's recall that we have ∠XWY = 49°, which is an inscribed angle or some other type of angle. Also, we have points lying on lines and circles.

Let me try to consider the diagram again. Since points X, Y, Z are on the circle centered at B, and points W, C, A are other points possibly outside the circle.

Given that point X lies on line WC and line ZW. Since line WC contains points Z and X, and point Z lies on line XC. So line XC passes through Z, which is on line WC. Thus, points X, Z, and C are colinear. Similarly, point Y lies on line WA. 

Now, considering the angle ∠XWY = 49°. This angle is formed at point W, with segments WX and WY. So W is a common vertex, and the rays go to X and Y. Since X is on line WC and Y is on line WA, we can infer that lines WX and WY are parts of lines WC and WA respectively.

Let me try to think about the relationship between these angles and arcs. Since ∠XWY is an angle formed by two chords (WX and WY) meeting at point W, which is outside the circle. Wait, because points X and Y are on the circle, but W is not necessarily on the circle. So ∠XWY is an external angle with respect to the circle. There's a theorem about the measure of an angle formed by two secants intersecting outside the circle: the measure is half the difference of the intercepted arcs.

Yes! The formula is: If two secant lines intersect at a point outside the circle, then the measure of the angle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

In this case, ∠XWY is formed by secants WX and WY intercepting arcs XY and... Well, the intercepted arcs would be the arc from X to Y that doesn't contain W, and the arc from X to Y that does contain W? Wait, actually, the angle formed outside the circle by two secants intercepts two arcs: the larger arc and the smaller arc. The measure of the angle is half the difference of those two arcs.

So, applying that formula:

Measure of ∠XWY = ½ (measure of arc XY - measure of arc XZY)

Wait, but in our case, the angle is formed by points X and Y on the circle, with vertex at W outside. So the intercepted arcs would be arc XY (the arc not containing W) and arc X'Y' (the arc that contains W, but since the circle is fixed, it's the major arc if W is outside). However, in our case, since the circle is centered at B, and W is some point outside, the intercepted arcs would be the arc XY (minor arc) and the arc XZY (major arc). Therefore, the measure of angle ∠XWY is ½ (measure of major arc XY - measure of minor arc XY).

We are told that ∠XWY is 49°, and we know that the measure of minor arc XY is 96°, as given. Therefore, plugging into the formula:

49° = ½ (MajorArcXY - MinorArcXY)

We know that MajorArcXY = 360° - MinorArcXY. Since the entire circle is 360°, so:

49 = ½ ( (360 - 96) - 96 ) ?

Wait, no. Wait, the formula is:

Measure of angle = ½ (difference of intercepted arcs)

Which is ½ (larger arc - smaller arc). Here, the larger arc would be the arc that's opposite to the angle, i.e., the arc that doesn't include the point W. Wait, actually, the angle formed by two secants outside the circle intercepts two arcs: the arc between the two points (the minor arc) and the arc that goes the long way around the circle (the major arc). The measure of the angle is half the difference of these two arcs.

So in this case, since the angle is formed by secants to points X and Y, the intercepted arcs are arc XY (the minor arc) and arc XYY (the major arc). Wait, but arc XY can be either minor or major. Given that the measure of the minor arc XY is 96°, then the major arc XY is 360° - 96° = 264°. Therefore, the measure of angle ∠XWY is ½ (264° - 96°) = ½ (168°) = 84°. But according to the problem, ∠XWY is 49°, which contradicts this calculation. Therefore, my assumption must be wrong.

Wait, that suggests inconsistency. Which means I made a mistake in identifying which arcs are intercepted. Let me re-examine the formula.

Actually, when the vertex of the angle is outside the circle, the angle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are the arcs that are intercepted by the two secants. Specifically, the angle is half the difference between the measure of the arc that's farther away from the angle and the arc that's closer. Wait, actually, the formula is:

Measure of angle = ½ ( measure of far arc - measure of near arc )

Where "far arc" is the arc that's opposite the angle, and "near arc" is the arc that's adjacent to the angle.

Wait, but in this case, the angle is formed by two secants: one going to X and one going to Y. The intercepted arcs are the arc between X and Y that is not containing the point W, and the arc between X and Y that contains the point W. Wait, but how do we know which arc is which? It depends on where point W is located.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the angle is formed outside the circle, so the intercepted arcs are the ones that are not overlapping. Let me look up the exact formula.

According to the external angle theorem: The measure of an angle formed by two secants intersecting outside the circle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

So, if two secants intersect at point W outside the circle, and intercept arcs AB and CD, then the measure of the angle is ½ (arc AC - arc BD) or something similar. Wait, more accurately, if the two secants intercept arcs that are opposite each other. For example, suppose the two secants are WA and WB, intercepting arcs AB and CD. Wait, perhaps better phrased: When two secants intersect outside the circle at point W, then the measure of the angle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs that are intercepted by the two secants. Specifically, if the two intercepted arcs are arc XY (between X and Y) and arc X'Y' (some other arc)? Wait, no, the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are intercepted by the two secants. In this case, the two secants are WX and WY. These secants intercept arcs on the circle. So, the angle at W intercepts arcs XY (the arc between X and Y) and... Well, since the two secants meet at W, the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are opposite to the angle. So the angle intercepts the arc that is opposite to it, which would be arc XY (if the angle is formed by secants to X and Y), and the other arc would be the rest of the circle. Wait, but I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, let me refer to a concrete example. Suppose we have a circle with two points X and Y on the circle. Point W is outside the circle. The two secants from W are WX and WY. The angle at W is formed by these two secants. The intercepted arcs are the arc from X to Y that does not contain W (let's call it arc XY) and the arc from X to Y that does contain W (which would be the major arc XY). Therefore, the measure of angle W is ½ (measure of major arc XY - measure of minor arc XY). 

But in our case, the measure of angle W is given as 49°, and we know that the minor arc XY is 96°, as per the given measure of arc XY (assuming that arc XY is the minor arc). So substituting:

49° = ½ (MajorArcXY - 96°)

Let’s denote MajorArcXY as M. Then,

49 = ½ (M - 96)

Multiply both sides by 2:

98 = M - 96 → M = 98 + 96 = 194°

So MajorArcXY is 194°, which would mean that the minor arc XY is 360 - 194 = 166°, but wait, no. Wait, the minor arc XY is given as 96°, so the major arc XY would be 360° - 96° = 264°, which conflicts with our calculation above. Wait, this is conflicting. According to the formula, if angle W is 49°, then MajorArcXY - minorArcXY = 98°, so MajorArcXY = minorArcXY + 98°. But if minorArcXY is 96°, then MajorArcXY would be 96 + 98 = 194°, which contradicts the fact that the major arc should be 360 - minor arc. Therefore, there's an inconsistency here. Which means my assumption that the minor arc XY is 96° must be incorrect.

Wait, maybe the given arc XY is not the minor arc. Perhaps the arc XY mentioned in the problem is the major arc? Because if the arc XY is the major arc, then the measure would be 194°, which would align with the calculation. Let me check again.

The problem states: Equals(MeasureOf(Arc(X, B, Y)), 96). So if Arc(X, B, Y) refers to the arc from X to Y passing through B, but since B is the center, this is ambiguous. However, if we take that arc XY is the major arc, then the measure would be 194°, but that doesn't match the given value of 96°. Alternatively, maybe the arc XY is the minor arc, and the formula gave us that MajorArcXY = 194°, which would imply that the minor arc XY is 360 - 194 = 166°, but that contradicts the given 96°. So there must be a misunderstanding in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the given arc XY is not the minor arc but another arc. Let me think differently.

Maybe the arc XY is not directly related to the angle at W. Let me try to approach this step by step.

We have points X and Y on the circle centered at B. We know that the measure of arc XY is 96°, assuming it's the minor arc. Then, using the external angle formula, the angle at W is ½ (MajorArcXY - minorArcXY). Plugging in the values, if minorArcXY = 96°, then:

angle W = ½ (MajorArcXY - 96°) = 49°

So, solving:

MajorArcXY = 96° + 2*49° = 96 + 98 = 194°

Thus, the major arc XY is 194°, which would mean that the minor arc XY is 360 - 194 = 166°, but this contradicts the given measure of 96°. Hence, contradiction arises. Therefore, my assumption that the given arc XY is the minor arc is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the given arc XY is the major arc. Let's say that the measure of arc XY is 194°, which matches the calculation. Then, the minor arc XY would be 360 - 194 = 166°, and then angle W would be ½ (194 - 166) = ½ * 28 = 14°, which doesn't match the given 49°. Not helpful.

Wait, this suggests that there's a fundamental error in my reasoning. Let me double-check the external angle formula.

The formula is: measure of angle formed by two secants outside the circle = ½ (difference of intercepted arcs). The intercepted arcs are the arcs that are intercepted by the two secants, which are the arc between X and Y (not containing W) and the arc between X and Y that does contain W. Wait, but if the angle is formed outside, the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are opposite the angle. So if the angle is at W, then the intercepted arcs are arc XY (the arc that doesn't contain W) and arc XY (the arc that does contain W). Wait, but there are two arcs between X and Y: the minor and the major arc. So the formula becomes:

measure of angle = ½ ( measure of major arc XY - measure of minor arc XY )

So, if we're told that angle W is 49°, and the measure of minor arc XY is 96°, then:

49 = ½ (major arc XY - 96)

=> major arc XY = 98 + 96 = 194°

So the major arc XY is 194°, which makes the minor arc XY = 360 - 194 = 166°, but this contradicts the given measure of minor arc XY as 96°. So this suggests that the given arc XY is not the minor arc, but rather the major arc. However, the problem states that MeasureOf(Arc(X, B, Y)) is 96°, which we initially thought was the minor arc. But if the major arc XY is 194°, then the minor arc would be 166°, which is inconsistent with the given 96°. So there's a conflict here. What's the resolution?

Perhaps the arc XY mentioned in the problem is not the arc between X and Y on the circle, but instead another arc? Or maybe the arc is not between X and Y, but involves another point?

Wait, the problem says Arc(X, B, Y). In some contexts, specifying three points defines an arc: the arc from X to Y that passes through B. But since B is the center, this arc would be a straight line from X to Y through B, which would imply that B lies on the arc. But an arc on a circle cannot pass through the center unless it's a diameter. Wait, but if B is the center, then the arc from X to Y passing through B would require that B is on the arc, which would mean that the arc is a semicircle if XB and YB are diameters, but in general, it's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the notation Arc(X, B, Y) is intended to mean the arc from X to Y with center at B, which would be the central angle. So, the measure of that arc is the central angle ∠XBY. So, if that is 96°, then the arc XY (central angle) is 96°, making it the minor arc. But then the external angle calculation leads to inconsistency. So there must be another way to interpret this.

Alternatively, perhaps the arc XY is not the minor arc, but the arc that goes through point Z? Wait, but Z is another point on the circle. Wait, the problem says that Z is on the circle as well. So maybe the arc XY is not directly between X and Y, but involving Z? But the notation is Arc(X, B, Y), which still suggests it's from X to Y through B.

This seems like a dead end. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the issue is that the angle at W is not formed by two secants, but by a tangent and a secant, or something else. Let me check the problem again.

The angle given is ∠XWY, with W being a point. The points X and Y are on the circle. Are there any tangents involved? Not sure yet. But based on the given constraints, W is connected to X and Y through lines. From earlier, we had:

- Point X lies on line ZW and line WC.

- Point Y lies on line WA.

- Point Z lies on line WC and line XC.

- Point Z is on line XC, so line XC connects X and C, passing through Z.

- Point Z is on line WC, so line WC connects W and C, passing through Z.

So, point C is connected to both X and W via line WC. And line XC passes through Z.

So, line WC connects W to C, and passes through Z and X. So, W---Z---X---C? Or some other arrangement. Let me assume that the order is W, Z, X, C on line WC. But without specific info, hard to tell. 

Now, regarding the angle at W, ∠XWY. So, point W is connected to X and to Y. Since Y is on line WA, which connects W to A. So line WA connects W to A, and Y is somewhere on that line. So, WY is part of line WA. Similarly, WX is part of line WC.

So, the angle at W between WX and WY is formed by two lines: one going to X (along WC) and one going to Y (along WA). Therefore, the angle ∠XWY is formed by two secants: WX and WY, intersecting at W outside the circle. Therefore, applying the external angle formula.

As before, the measure of ∠XWY = ½ (measure of arc XY - measure of arc XZYZ... ? Wait, no, the intercepted arcs are the arcs between X and Y that are intercepted by the secants. So, the two intercepted arcs are the arc XY (the one that's opposite to the angle) and... Well, since the angle is formed by two secants, there are two arcs: the arc between X and Y that's not containing the angle (i.e., the arc that's opposite), and the arc that's containing the angle? No, it's always the difference between the intercepted arcs.

Wait, the formula is: measure of angle = ½ (measure of the intercepted arc that's farther from the angle minus the measure of the intercepted arc that's closer to the angle). But in this case, since the angle is outside, the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are intercepted by the two secants. For two secants intersecting outside, the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are the arcs that are intercepted by the two secants. In this case, the two secants are WX and WY, which intercept arcs on the circle. Those arcs are the arc from X to Y that does not contain W, and the arc from X to Y that contains W. Wait, but how do we know which arc is which?

Actually, the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are cut off by the two secants. So, since the secants go from W to X and W to Y, they intercept the arc between X and Y that's opposite to W. So, the angle is formed outside, and the intercepted arcs are the arc XY (the one not containing W) and the arc that goes around the other side of the circle. Wait, but how do we determine which one is which?

Let me think of the circle with points X and Y. If W is outside the circle, then the angle at W intercepts the arc XY that does not contain W, and the arc that does contain W. But since W is outside, the arc that contains W would be the major arc if the angle is small. However, in this case, we don't know where W is located.

But regardless, the formula is:

measure of angle = ½ ( measure of arc XY (far) - measure of arc XY (near) )

Assuming that the far arc is the one that's opposite to the angle, and near arc is the one that's closer. But without knowing the location of W, it's hard to say. But perhaps we can proceed with variables.

Let’s denote the measure of arc XY (the one not containing W) as α, and the measure of arc XY (containing W) as β. Since α + β = 360°, because they are the two arcs between X and Y. Then, the angle at W is ½ (β - α) = 49°.

But we also know that the measure of arc XY (as given) is 96°. Wait, but which arc is this? Is this the α or β? If the given arc measure is α, then β = 360 - α = 360 - 96 = 264°. Then, the angle would be ½ (264 - 96) = ½ * 168 = 84°, which does not match the given 49°. 

Alternatively, if the given arc measure is β (the major arc), then α = 360 - β. If β = 96°, then α = 360 - 96 = 264°, and the angle would be ½ (96 - 264) = ½ (-168) = -84°, which is impossible since angles are positive. Hence, this suggests that the given arc measure is neither α nor β, but perhaps another arc.

Wait, but the given arc is Arc(X, B, Y), which we assumed was the arc XY with measure 96°, but if that's not α or β, then what is it?

Maybe the arc XY is not between X and Y, but involves another point? Like, perhaps the arc from X to Y passing through B? But since B is the center, this arc would pass through the center, which would mean it's a diameter if X and Y are diametrically opposed. But since the measure is 96°, it's not a diameter. So, this suggests that the arc is not passing through B, but the notation Arc(X, B, Y) might be a typo or misinterpretation.

Alternatively, perhaps the arc is from X to Y, and B is a point on the arc. But since B is the center, this would mean that the arc goes from X to Y passing through B, which would require that B lies on the arc. But since B is the center, this is only possible if the arc is a semicircle, but the measure is 96°, which is not 180°. So this is not possible.

At this point, I'm stuck with the interpretation of the given arc measure. Let me try to proceed with the assumption that the arc XY is the minor arc, measure 96°, and see if I can reconcile the external angle formula with the given angle at W of 49°.

From earlier, we have:

angle W = ½ (major arc XY - minor arc XY) = 49°

Let’s denote minor arc XY as m, major arc XY as M.

So, M = 360 - m.

Then, angle W = ½ (M - m) = ½ (360 - m - m) = ½ (360 - 2m) = 180 - m.

But the given angle W is 49°, so:

180 - m = 49 → m = 180 - 49 = 131°

But this contradicts the given measure of arc XY as 96°. Hence, this suggests that either the given arc measure is not the minor arc, or there's a different relation.

Wait, this suggests that if the measure of the angle at W is 49°, then the minor arc XY is 131°, but the problem states it's 96°. This inconsistency implies that there's a mistake in my assumptions.

Perhaps the given arc XY is not the arc between X and Y, but another arc? Let me revisit the original problem statement.

The first constraint is Equals(MeasureOf(Arc(X, B, Y)), 96). The notation Arc(X, B, Y) likely means the arc from X to Y passing through B. Since B is the center, this arc would be the arc that starts at X, goes through B, and ends at Y. But since B is the center, this arc would pass through the center, implying that it's a straight line from X to Y through B. But an arc on a circle cannot pass through the center unless it's a semicircle. However, the measure is 96°, which is not a semicircle. Therefore, this suggests that the arc is not passing through B, but the notation is misleading. Maybe the arc is from X to Y, and B is just a label for the circle, not a point on the arc. 

Alternatively, perhaps the arc is named using three points: X, B, Y, where B is the center, and the arc is the arc XY that is associated with the circle centered at B. In this case, the arc XY is simply the arc from X to Y on the circle centered at B, and the measure is 96°, which would be the central angle. So, ∠XBY = 96°, and this is the measure of the arc XY. 

With this understanding, let's re-express the earlier equation. If ∠XBY = 96°, then the arc XY is 96°, which is the minor arc. Then, using the external angle formula, we have:

angle W = ½ (major arc XY - minor arc XY) = ½ (360 - 96 - 96) = ½ (168) = 84°. But the problem states that angle W is 49°, so this doesn't match. 

This suggests that either the given arc is not the minor arc, or there's another factor at play. Perhaps the angle at W is not formed by two secants, but by a tangent and a secant? Let me check.

If one of the lines is a tangent and the other is a secant, the formula changes. The measure of the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. For example, if one line is a tangent and the other is a secant, the angle is ½ (difference of the intercepted arcs). But in our case, both lines WX and WY are secants, as both X and Y are points on the circle. So, it should be the case of two secants.

But since the calculation leads to inconsistency, maybe there's another approach. Let me try to consider the positions of the points.

Since points X, Y, Z are on the circle centered at B, and we have various lines connecting them to W, C, A. Let me try to find relationships between the angles and arcs.

We know that ∠XWY = 49°, and we need to relate this to other elements. Let's consider triangles or other angles.

Another idea: Since X and Y are on the circle, and W is outside, maybe we can relate ∠XWY to other angles. Also, since Z is on the circle, and lies on line WC and line XC, perhaps there are some cyclic quadrilaterals or inscribed angles.

Wait, if Z is on the circle, then ∠XZY would be an inscribed angle. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since Z is on line WC and line XC, and X is on line WC, then Z is a point on line XC. So, line XC passes through Z. Also, Z is on line WC, so lines XC and WC intersect at Z. Therefore, C is a point such that line XC passes through Z, and line WC passes through Z. Hence, points W, Z, C are collinear, with Z between W and C, or C between W and Z, etc. Let's assume that W---Z---C, with X also on line WC. Since X is on line WC, and Z is on line WC, then X could be between W and Z, or between Z and C, or on the extension.

But since X is on line WC and line ZW, which is the same as line WC, then X is on line WC. So, points W, Z, X, C are collinear in some order.

Let me assume that the order is W---Z---X---C. So, from W to Z to X to C. Then, line XC is from X to C, passing through Z. So, Z is between X and C. 

Now, since point Z is on the circle, and X is also on the circle. So, points X and Z are both on the circle. Therefore, segment XZ is a chord of the circle. Similarly, point Y is on the circle.

Now, the question asks for the measure of arc YXZ. Assuming this is the arc from Y to Z passing through X, which would be the arc YXZ. To find this measure, we need to find the measure of arc YZ that passes through X.

Let me denote this arc as arc YZX, which would be the arc from Y to Z passing through X. The measure of this arc would be equal to the measure of arc YZ plus arc ZX, but since it passes through X, it's the arc from Y to Z that goes through X.

Alternatively, since X is on the circle, the arc YXZ is the arc from Y to Z passing through X, which is the sum of arc YX and arc XZ.

But we need to find the measure of this arc. Let's denote arc YX as a and arc XZ as b, so the measure of arc YXZ is a + b.

But how to find a and b?

We know that arc XY is 96°, which is the arc from X to Y. If we can find the position of Z, we might relate it to other arcs.

Since Z is on the circle, and on line WC, which passes through X and C. Let's consider the position of Z.

If we can find the measure of arc XZ, then we can add it to arc XY to get the arc YXZ, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the angle at W, ∠XWY = 49°, and relate it to other arcs.

Earlier, we had an inconsistency in the external angle formula, but let's try to resolve it by assuming that the given arc XY is the major arc, even though it's stated as 96°. Let's say that the arc XY is the major arc with measure 96°, then the minor arc XY would be 360 - 96 = 264°, and the angle at W would be ½ (major arc - minor arc) = ½ (96 - 264) = -84°, which is impossible. So this is invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps the arc XY is not between X and Y, but between X and Z? No, the notation is Arc(X, B, Y). 

Wait, perhaps the arc is from X to Y, and B is a point on the arc? But B is the center, so this would mean the arc passes through the center, which would make it a diameter if it's 180°, but it's 96°, so it's not. Hence, this is not possible.

This suggests that there's a fundamental misunderstanding in interpreting the arc measure. Let me try to think differently. Let's forget about the arc measure for now and focus on the angle at W.

If ∠XWY = 49°, and it's formed by two secants, then using the external angle formula, we have:

49 = ½ ( measure of arc XY - measure of arc XZYZ... ? No, it's ½ ( measure of arc XY (far) - measure of arc XY (near) ). But without knowing which arc is which, it's difficult. 

But if we assume that the arc XY is the one that is not containing W, and the other arc is the one containing W, then:

Let’s denote the measure of arc XY (not containing W) as m, and the measure of arc XY (containing W) as n. Then, m + n = 360°, and angle W = ½ (n - m) = 49°. 

But we also know from the problem that the measure of arc XY is 96°, which could be either m or n. Let's say that the given arc measure is m = 96°, then n = 360 - 96 = 264°, and angle W = ½ (264 - 96) = 84°, which doesn't match the given 49°. If the given arc measure is n = 96°, then m = 360 - 96 = 264°, and angle W = ½ (96 - 264) = -84°, which is invalid. 

This suggests that the given arc measure is not directly related to the angle at W, and thus my earlier assumption about the arc measure is incorrect. Maybe the arc measure is not arc XY but another arc? 

Let me review the problem statement again. It says: Equals(MeasureOf(Arc(X, B, Y)), 96). This could mean that the arc from X to Y, passing through B, which is the center. But since B is the center, this arc would pass through B, which is inside the circle, not on the circumference. Hence, it's not a valid arc on the circle. This suggests that there's a mislabeling or misinterpretation.

Perhaps the arc is from X to B to Y, but B is not on the arc. Wait, but the arc is from X to Y, and B is just the center of the circle. Maybe the arc is named with the center, but it's still the arc XY on the circle. In that case, the measure is 96°, and we have to work with that.

Given that, and the angle at W being 49°, we have to accept that the external angle formula gives us a contradiction, which suggests that there's a missing piece of information or a different approach.

Let me try to use other given constraints. 

Points X, Y, Z are on the circle centered at B. Let's consider triangle XYZ. Since all points are on the circle, it's a triangle inscribed in the circle. The measure of arc XY is 96°, so the inscribed angle over arc XY would be half of that, 48°. But I don't see how this helps yet.

Also, point Z is on line WC and line XC. Let me consider triangle WXC. Since Z is on line XC and line WC, it's the intersection of those lines. 

Maybe we can find some relationships using power of a point or other circle theorems.

For point W, since it lies outside the circle, and lines WX and WY are secants, the power of point W with respect to the circle is equal to WX * WC = WY * WA. But I don't know the lengths, so this might not help directly.

Alternatively, since we know ∠XWY = 49°, and we know some arcs, perhaps we can find other angles.

Wait, let's try to find the measure of arc XZ. If we can find that, then we can add it to arc XY or something to get the desired arc.

But how?

Let me consider that point Z is on the circle, and on line WC. Since X is also on line WC, and Z is on line XC, which connects X to C. So, line XC passes through Z. Let me assume that line XC passes through Z, which is on the circle. So, point C is outside the circle, and line XC passes through Z, which is on the circle.

If I can find the measure of arc XZ, that would help.

Alternatively, since Z is on the circle, and X is also on the circle, the angle at Z, ∠XZB, would be related to the arc XB. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me try to use the fact that ∠XWY = 49°. Let's consider the triangle WXY. If I can find other angles or sides, maybe I can relate it to the circle.

Alternatively, since X and Y are on the circle, and W is outside, maybe we can use the Law of Sines or Cosines in triangle WXY, but without knowing lengths, it's challenging.

Another idea: Since points X and Y are on the circle, and W is outside, the angle ∠XWY is related to the arcs. Let me try to express it in terms of arcs.

If I let the measure of arc XY be 96° (given), and let the measure of arc XZ be a, and arc ZY be b, then the total circle is 360°, so 96 + a + b = 360. But I don't know a or b.

Alternatively, if I can find the measure of arc XZ, then the arc YXZ would be arc YZ + arc ZX, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the arc YXZ is the arc from Y to Z passing through X. So, it would be the sum of arc YX and arc XZ. If arc YX is 96°, and arc XZ is, say, c, then the measure of arc YXZ is 96 + c. So, if I can find c, I can find the answer.

How to find c?

Since Z is on the circle, and on line WC, which also contains X. So, line WC passes through X and Z. Let me consider the angle at W, ∠XWY = 49°, and see if there's a way to relate it to arc XZ.

Alternatively, since Z is on the circle, and X is also on the circle, the line XZ is a chord of the circle. The angle subtended by this chord at the center is the central angle for arc XZ.

But how does this relate to the angle at W?

Maybe using the external angle formula again, but now for angle at W with respect to arc XZ.

Wait, but we don't have an angle at W involving Z. However, if we can find some relationship...

Alternatively, let me consider that since Z is on line WC, and X is on line WC, then line WC passes through X and Z. Let me consider the power of point W with respect to the circle. The power of W is equal to WX * WC = WZ * WC. Wait, no, power of a point W with respect to the circle is equal to the product of the lengths from W to the points of intersection with the circle. Since line WC intersects the circle at X and Z (assuming that W is outside and the line passes through X and Z), then power of W is WX * WZ = WY * WA.

But we don't know the lengths, so this might not help directly. However, if we assume that the lengths are proportional to the segments, but without numerical values, it's tricky.

But maybe we can relate the angles. Let me think.

If I consider the angle ∠XWY = 49°, and if I can find the measure of arc XZ, then maybe there's a relationship.

Alternatively, since Z is on the circle, and X is on the circle, the angle ∠XZB is equal to half the measure of arc XB, where B is the center. But I don't know if this helps.

Wait, let's try to use coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to simplify.

Let me place the circle centered at B at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Let's assume the radius is 5.0, as given.

Let me assign coordinates to points X, Y, Z on the circle. Let me assume that point X is at (5, 0), so it's on the circle. The arc from X to Y is 96°, so if I rotate 96° counterclockwise from X, I can find the coordinates of Y.

Let me define the coordinate system:

- Center B is at (0,0).
- Point X is at (5, 0).
- The arc from X to Y is 96°, so the angle at the center ∠XBY is 96°. So, point Y is at an angle of 96° from X. Since X is at angle 0°, Y would be at 96°. So, coordinates of Y would be (5 cos 96°, 5 sin 96°).

Now, point Z is also on the circle. Let me assume it's somewhere on the circle. But how to determine its position?

From the constraints, point Z is on line WC and line XC. Let me try to define point W.

Point W is such that X is on line ZW and Y is on line WA. Also, Z is on line WC and XC. Let me try to define W and C.

Since X is on line WC, and Z is on line WC, and X is also on line ZW, this suggests that line WC passes through X and Z. Let me assume that W is a point outside the circle, and line WC passes through X and Z. Let me define W as a point such that line WC passes through X and Z. Since Z is on the circle, and X is on the circle, line WC is a secant line passing through X and Z.

Let me assume that W is on the extension of line XC beyond X, so that line WC passes through X and Z. Let me define point C as a point such that line XC passes through Z. 

This is getting too abstract. Maybe I should use the angle at W to derive relationships.

Let me return to the external angle formula. If I can't resolve the contradiction, perhaps the given arc measure is not arc XY but another arc. Let me assume that the given arc measure is arc XZ, or arc YZ, or something else.

Alternatively, let me consider that the measure of arc YXZ is what we need to find, and it's equal to 360° minus the measure of arc YZ. Wait, no, it depends on the position.

If the arc YXZ is the major arc YZ passing through X, then its measure would be 360° - arc YZ. But I need to find arc YZ.

Alternatively, if I can find the measure of arc YZ, then I can subtract it from 360° to get the measure of the arc YXZ.

But how to find arc YZ?

Let me try to use the angle at W. If I can relate it to arc YZ.

Wait, if I consider the angle at W, ∠XWY = 49°, and if I can relate it to arc YZ or something.

Alternatively, let me consider that line WA passes through Y, and line WC passes through X and Z. If I can find the angle at W relating to arc YZ.

But I'm not seeing it. Maybe I need to give up and choose the closest answer based on the earlier calculation where the major arc XY was 194°, leading to the arc YXZ being 194°, which is option B (166) or C (194). Wait, option C is 194. If the major arc XY is 194°, then the arc YXZ, which might be the major arc YZ or something else, might be related.

Wait, earlier calculation suggested that if angle W is 49°, then major arc XY is 194°, which would mean that the minor arc XY is 166°, but this contradicts the given 96°. However, if we ignore the contradiction and take major arc XY as 194°, then the arc YXZ might be related to this.

If arc YXZ is the major arc YZ, but I don't know.

Alternatively, if the measure of arc YXZ is the major arc YZ, which would be 194°, matching option C. But this is speculative.

Given the options, and the earlier calculation where the major arc XY was 194°, which is option C, and if the arc YXZ is related to this, then maybe the answer is C.

But this is very uncertain. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll go with option C: 194°, as it was derived from the external angle calculation, even though there was a contradiction, and it matches one of the options.
