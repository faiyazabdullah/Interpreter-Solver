1. **Analyzing the Given Geometric Constraints:**
   - We have several line segments with specific lengths:
     - \( \text{Length of Line(W, B)} = 8 \)
     - \( \text{Length of Line(B, X)} = s - 7 \)
     - \( \text{Length of Line(Y, B)} = 6 \)
     - \( \text{Length of Line(Z, B)} = 2t - 6 \)
   - Points B, W, X, Y, Z lie on lines such that:
     - Point B lies on Line(Z, W)
     - Point B lies on Line(X, Y)

2. **Understanding the Question:**
   - We need to find the value of \( t \) in the context of a parallelogram. The configuration of points and lines suggests that these might form a parallelogram.
   - In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in length.

3. **Identifying Relevant Properties:**
   - Since Point B lies on Line(Z, W) and Point B also lies on Line(X, Y), we can infer that:
     - \( \text{Line(Z, W)} \) and \( \text{Line(X, Y)} \) could be two pairs of opposite sides of a parallelogram.

4. **Setting Up Equations Using Parallelogram Properties:**
   - For a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal:
     - \( \text{Length of Line(W, B)} = \text{Length of Line(Y, B)} \)
     - \( \text{Length of Line(Z, B)} = \text{Length of Line(B, X)} \)

5. **Applying the Equations:**
   - From \( \text{Length of Line(W, B)} = \text{Length of Line(Y, B)} \):
     - \( 8 = 6 \) (This is not possible, indicating these are not opposite sides)
   - From \( \text{Length of Line(Z, B)} = \text{Length of Line(B, X)} \):
     - \( 2t - 6 = s - 7 \)

6. **Exploring Further:**
   - Since \( \text{Length of Line(W, B)} = 8 \) and \( \text{Length of Line(Y, B)} = 6 \), these must be adjacent sides.
   - Therefore, the other pair of opposite sides must be \( \text{Line(Z, B)} \) and \( \text{Line(B, X)} \).

7. **Solving for \( t \):**
   - Set \( 2t - 6 = s - 7 \).
   - Since \( \text{Line(W, B)} \) and \( \text{Line(Y, B)} \) are adjacent, and \( \text{Line(Z, B)} \) and \( \text{Line(B, X)} \) are opposite, we need to find \( t \) such that \( 2t - 6 = s - 7 \).

8. **Using the Length of Line(W, B) and Line(Y, B):**
   - Since \( \text{Line(W, B)} = 8 \) and \( \text{Line(Y, B)} = 6 \), these are not equal, confirming they are adjacent sides.
   - We need to ensure \( \text{Line(Z, B)} = \text{Line(B, X)} \).

9. **Reassessing the Equation:**
   - \( 2t - 6 = s - 7 \)
   - We need to find a specific value for \( t \) without knowing \( s \), but we can use the fact that \( \text{Line(Z, B)} \) and \( \text{Line(B, X)} \) must be equal in a parallelogram.

10. **Finding \( t \):**
    - Assume \( s - 7 = 2t - 6 \).
    - Rearrange to find \( t \):
      \[
      2t - 6 = s - 7 \implies 2t = s - 1 \implies t = \frac{s - 1}{2}
      \]
    - We need \( t \) to be a specific value from the choices given.

11. **Testing Values:**
    - Since \( \text{Length of Line(Z, B)} = 2t - 6 \) must be positive, \( 2t - 6 > 0 \) implies \( t > 3 \).
    - Test the given choices:
      - A. \( t = 6 \): \( 2(6) - 6 = 12 - 6 = 6 \)
      - B. \( t = 7 \): \( 2(7) - 6 = 14 - 6 = 8 \)
      - C. \( t = 8 \): \( 2(8) - 6 = 16 - 6 = 10 \)
      - D. \( t = 13 \): \( 2(13) - 6 = 26 - 6 = 20 \)

12. **Matching with Known Lengths:**
    - We know \( \text{Length of Line(W, B)} = 8 \).
    - \( t = 7 \) makes \( \text{Length of Line(Z, B)} = 8 \), matching \( \text{Length of Line(W, B)} \).

13. **Conclusion:**
    - \( t = 7 \) satisfies the condition for opposite sides in the parallelogram, where \( \text{Length of Line(Z, B)} = \text{Length of Line(W, B)} \).

</think>

<Solution>
Given the geometric constraints and the properties of a parallelogram, we determined that the opposite sides must be equal. By setting up the equation \( 2t - 6 = s - 7 \) and testing the given values for \( t \), we found that \( t = 7 \) satisfies the condition where \( \text{Length of Line(Z, B)} = \text{Length of Line(W, B)} = 8 \). Thus, the correct value of \( t \) is 7.
