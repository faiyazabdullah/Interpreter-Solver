**Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints**
- We have a kite with points \( H, A, G, F, \) and \( J \).
- Length of line \( HA \) is 15.
- Length of line \( AG \) is 12.
- Point \( A \) lies on both lines \( HF \) and \( GJ \).

**Step 2: Understand the Properties of a Kite**
- A kite has two pairs of adjacent sides that are equal. Typically, one diagonal bisects the other.
- The diagonals are perpendicular to each other.

**Step 3: Identify What Needs to be Found**
- We need to find the length of \( GH \).

**Step 4: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**
- Since \( A \) lies on both \( HF \) and \( GJ \), \( A \) is the intersection of the diagonals of the kite.
- The diagonals of a kite are perpendicular, so \( \triangle HAG \) is a right triangle with \( \angle HAG = 90^\circ \).

**Step 5: Use the Pythagorean Theorem**
- In right triangle \( \triangle HAG \), we have:
  \[
  HG^2 = HA^2 + AG^2
  \]
- Substitute the known values:
  \[
  HG^2 = 15^2 + 12^2 = 225 + 144 = 369
  \]
- Therefore, \( HG = \sqrt{369} \).

**Step 6: Compare Calculated Result with Answer Choices**
- The calculated length \( HG = \sqrt{369} \) matches answer choice D.

**Step 7: Verify and Confirm**
- Reassess the calculations and logical steps to ensure no errors were made.
- The use of the Pythagorean theorem is appropriate given the right triangle configuration.

**Step 8: Select the Closest Answer Choice**
- The calculated result \( \sqrt{369} \) exactly matches choice D.

**Solution:**

Given the constraints and properties of the kite, we identified that \( \triangle HAG \) is a right triangle. Applying the Pythagorean theorem, we calculated \( HG = \sqrt{369} \). This matches answer choice D.
