**Thought Section**

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given that quadrilateral EFGH is a rectangle.
   - Point K lies on two lines: Line(H, F) and Line(E, G).
   - Line(H, G) is perpendicular to Line(H, E).

2. **Identify What is Given and What Needs to Be Found**:
   - EF = HG and EH = FG (since EFGH is a rectangle).
   - F K = 32 feet.
   - We need to find the length of EG.

3. **Analyzing the Geometric Constraints**:
   - Since EFGH is a rectangle, all angles are 90 degrees.
   - Line(H, G) is perpendicular to Line(H, E), confirming the rectangle's properties.

4. **Position of Point K**:
   - Since K lies on Line(H, F) and Line(E, G), K must be the intersection of these lines.
   - In a rectangle, the diagonals (EG and FH) intersect at their midpoints.

5. **Using the Rectangle Properties**:
   - Let the coordinates of E be (0, 0), F be (a, 0), G be (a, b), and H be (0, b).
   - The midpoint of diagonal EG is ((a/2), (b/2)).
   - The midpoint of diagonal FH is also ((a/2), (b/2)).

6. **Position of K**:
   - Since K is the intersection of diagonals, K is at ((a/2), (b/2)).

7. **Distance FK**:
   - F is at (a, 0) and K is at ((a/2), (b/2)).
   - Use the distance formula to find FK:
     \[
     FK = \sqrt{\left(a - \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(0 - \frac{b}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2}
     \]
   - Given FK = 32 feet:
     \[
     \sqrt{\left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2} = 32
     \]
     \[
     \frac{a^2}{4} + \frac{b^2}{4} = 1024
     \]
     \[
     a^2 + b^2 = 4096
     \]

8. **Finding EG**:
   - Diagonal EG is calculated using the distance formula:
     \[
     EG = \sqrt{(a - 0)^2 + (b - 0)^2} = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
     \]
   - From the equation \(a^2 + b^2 = 4096\), we have:
     \[
     EG = \sqrt{4096} = 64
     \]

9. **Conclusion**:
   - The length of EG is 64 feet.
   - Compare this with the answer choices: A. 13, B. 30, C. 57, D. 64.
   - The correct choice is D. 64.
