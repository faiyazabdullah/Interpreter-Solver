1. **Analyze the Geometric Constraints:**
   - We have a geometric figure involving points A, B, C, D with several lines and angles.
   - The angle ∠ADB is 45 degrees.
   - Line AB has a length y.
   - Line CD has a length x.
   - Line AC has a length of 5.
   - Point B lies on line CD.
   - Line AD is perpendicular to line AC.
   - Line BC is perpendicular to line BA.

2. **Visualize the Configuration:**
   - Since AD ⊥ AC, triangle ACD is a right triangle with AC as one leg.
   - Since BC ⊥ BA, triangle ABC is a right triangle with AB as one leg.
   - Point B lies on line CD, which suggests B is somewhere on the line extending through C and D.

3. **Apply Relevant Theorems:**
   - In right triangle ACD, since AD ⊥ AC, and ∠ADB = 45°, triangle ADB is a 45-45-90 triangle.
   - In a 45-45-90 triangle, the legs are equal, and the hypotenuse is √2 times the length of a leg.

4. **Determine Relationships:**
   - In triangle ADB, since ∠ADB = 45°, AD = DB.
   - Let AD = DB = z. Then AB (hypotenuse) = z√2.
   - Since AC = 5, and AD is perpendicular to AC, triangle ACD is a right triangle.

5. **Calculate Using Pythagorean Theorem:**
   - In triangle ACD, using Pythagorean theorem: \( AC^2 + AD^2 = CD^2 \).
   - Substitute known values: \( 5^2 + z^2 = x^2 \).

6. **Relate AB to Known Quantities:**
   - From triangle ADB, AB = z√2.
   - We need to find y, which is the length of AB.

7. **Use Trigonometric Relationships:**
   - In triangle ACD, since ∠CAD = 90°, and AD is perpendicular to AC, use trigonometry:
   - \( \tan(45°) = \frac{AD}{AC} = \frac{z}{5} \).
   - Since \(\tan(45°) = 1\), we have \( z = 5 \).

8. **Calculate y:**
   - Since AB = z√2 and z = 5, then \( y = AB = 5\sqrt{2} \).

9. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated value of y is \( 5\sqrt{2} \).
   - This matches choice C.

10. **Verify and Conclude:**
    - All calculations align with the given constraints and geometric properties.
    - The closest and correct answer choice is C.
</think>

**Solution:**
- Based on the analysis and calculations, the length of line AB (y) is \( 5\sqrt{2} \).
- Therefore, the correct answer is C.
