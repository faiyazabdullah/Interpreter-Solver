1. **Analyze the given geometric constraints:**
   - We have a rhombus \(ABCD\).
   - We know two properties of a rhombus: all sides are equal, and opposite angles are equal.
   - The given constraints are \(AB = 2x + 3\) and \(BC = 5x\).
   - Since \(AB = BC\) (all sides of a rhombus are equal), we equate these expressions:
     \[
     2x + 3 = 5x
     \]
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     3 = 5x - 2x \\
     3 = 3x \\
     x = 1
     \]
   - Substitute \(x = 1\) back into the expressions for the sides:
     \[
     AB = 2(1) + 3 = 5 \\
     BC = 5(1) = 5
     \]
   - Thus, all sides of the rhombus are 5.

2. **Identify what needs to be found:**
   - We need to find the measure of \(\angle AEB\), where point \(E\) lies on both line \(CA\) and line \(BD\).

3. **Apply relevant geometric theorems and properties:**
   - In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles (90 degrees).
   - Therefore, diagonal \(AC\) intersects diagonal \(BD\) at point \(E\) such that \(\angle AEB = 90^\circ\).

4. **Verify the accuracy of current steps:**
   - Given that the diagonals of a rhombus intersect at right angles, the conclusion that \(\angle AEB = 90^\circ\) is consistent with the properties of a rhombus.

5. **Compare your calculated result with the given answer choices:**
   - The calculated measure for \(\angle AEB\) is 90 degrees.
   - The answer choices provided are 45, 60, 90, and 180 degrees.
   - 90 degrees matches one of the provided choices.

6. **Select the correct answer:**
   - Based on the analysis, the measure of \(\angle AEB\) is 90 degrees.

</think>

<Solution>
In the rhombus \(ABCD\), since \(E\) is the intersection of the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\), and the diagonals of a rhombus intersect at right angles, \(\angle AEB\) measures \(90^\circ\). Therefore, the correct answer is:
