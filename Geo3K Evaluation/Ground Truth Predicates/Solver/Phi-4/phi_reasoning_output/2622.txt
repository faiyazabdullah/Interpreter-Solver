**Step 1: Analyze the given geometric constraints and question**

- We are given three pieces of information:
  1. \( \text{Length of line segment } AD = 8 \)
  2. \( \text{Length of line segment } EG = 4 \)
  3. \( \text{Area of quadrilateral } ABCD = 36 \)

- We need to find the area of a similar green figure, which is not explicitly described but is likely related to the quadrilateral \( ABCD \).

**Step 2: Summarize relevant findings**

- Since the figures are similar, the corresponding sides are proportional, and the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.

**Step 3: Identify the relationship between the figures**

- The side \( AD \) of quadrilateral \( ABCD \) corresponds to side \( EG \) of the green figure.
- The ratio of the corresponding sides is \( \frac{EG}{AD} = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2} \).

**Step 4: Apply the properties of similar figures**

- For similar figures, the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths.
- Therefore, the ratio of the areas is \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \).

**Step 5: Calculate the area of the green figure**

- The area of quadrilateral \( ABCD \) is 36.
- The area of the green figure is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9 \).

**Step 6: Compare with the answer choices**

- The calculated area of the green figure is 9.
- Among the answer choices, 9 is option A.

**Step 7: Verify the calculations**

- The calculations align with the properties of similar figures and the given data.
- The steps logically follow from the given constraints and the properties of similarity.

**Step 8: Select the closest answer choice**

- The calculated area of 9 matches exactly with option A.

**Step 9: Finalize the solution**

- Based on the analysis and calculations, the area of the green figure is 9.

**Solution:**

Based on the analysis of the given geometric constraints and the properties of similar figures, we determined that the area of the green figure is 9. This was calculated using the ratio of the corresponding side lengths and applying the properties of similar figures to find the ratio of their areas. The calculated area matches exactly with option A.
