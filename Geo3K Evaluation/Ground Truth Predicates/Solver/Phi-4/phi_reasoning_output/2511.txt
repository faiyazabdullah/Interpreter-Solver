### Thought Section

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

- We are given three points: A, B, and C.
- Line segment AB has a fixed length of 20.
- Line segments BC and AC both have the same length, denoted as \( x \).
- Line segments CB and CA are perpendicular to each other.

**Step 2: Geometric Interpretation**

- Given that BC and CA are perpendicular, triangle ABC is a right triangle with a right angle at C.
- In this right triangle, AB is the hypotenuse, while BC and AC are the legs.

**Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**

- For a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem states: 
  \[
  AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2
  \]
- Substituting the known values:
  \[
  20^2 = x^2 + x^2
  \]
- Simplifying gives:
  \[
  400 = 2x^2
  \]

**Step 4: Solve for \( x \)**

- Divide both sides by 2:
  \[
  200 = x^2
  \]
- Take the square root of both sides:
  \[
  x = \sqrt{200}
  \]
- Simplify \(\sqrt{200}\):
  \[
  x = \sqrt{100 \times 2} = \sqrt{100} \times \sqrt{2} = 10\sqrt{2}
  \]
- Approximate \(\sqrt{2} \approx 1.414\):
  \[
  x \approx 10 \times 1.414 = 14.14
  \]

**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated value of \( x \approx 14.14 \).
- Compare this with the given answer choices:
  - A. 1.4
  - B. 7.1
  - C. 14.1
  - D. 15.6

- The closest value to 14.14 is 14.1.

**Step 6: Verification**

- Re-evaluate the calculations to ensure no errors:
  - \( x^2 = 200 \) leads to \( x = \sqrt{200} \).
  - Approximation of \(\sqrt{200}\) is consistent with \( 10\sqrt{2} \approx 14.14 \).

**Step 7: Conclusion**

- Based on the calculations and comparison, the closest answer choice is C. 14.1.

**Solution Section**

- Using the Pythagorean theorem for the right triangle ABC, we derived:
  \[
  20^2 = x^2 + x^2 \implies 400 = 2x^2 \implies x^2 = 200 \implies x = \sqrt{200} = 10\sqrt{2}
  \]
- Approximating \(\sqrt{2} \approx 1.414\), we find:
  \[
  x \approx 10 \times 1.414 = 14.14
  \]
- The closest answer choice to 14.14 is 14.1.
