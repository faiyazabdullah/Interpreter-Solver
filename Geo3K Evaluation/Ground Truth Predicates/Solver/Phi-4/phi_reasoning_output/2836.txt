**Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints**

- Points J, G, B, and L are collinear.
- Points K, J, G, and B are collinear with L.
- Point G lies on Line JB.
- Points I, G are collinear with C.
- Points G, F, and H are collinear.
- Point G is on a circle centered at J with radius 6.
- Points F, L, B, H are on a circle centered at G with radius 1.
- Points D, J, L, and I, C are on a circle centered at K with radius 3.
- Circle G, J, and K intersect at L.

**Step 2: Identify the Required Measure**

We need to find the measure of J L, given that G H = 10.

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**

- **Circle with Center G and Radius 1:** 
  - Points F, L, B, H lie on this circle. Since G H = 10, and G is the center, H is 10 units from G.

- **Circle with Center J and Radius 6:**
  - G lies on this circle. Therefore, J G = 6.

- **Circle with Center K and Radius 3:**
  - Points D, J, L, I, C lie on this circle. Therefore, K J = K L = 3.

- **Intersection of Circles G, J, K at L:**
  - L is a common point on all three circles.

**Step 4: Use the Power of a Point Theorem**

- **Power of Point L with respect to Circle G:**
  - Since L is on the circle centered at G with radius 1, the power of L with respect to this circle is 0.

- **Power of Point L with respect to Circle J:**
  - L is on the circle centered at J with radius 6, so the power of L with respect to this circle is also 0.

- **Power of Point L with respect to Circle K:**
  - L is on the circle centered at K with radius 3, so the power of L with respect to this circle is 0.

**Step 5: Calculate J L Using Geometric Relationships**

- Since L is on the circle centered at J with radius 6, and L is also on the circle centered at K with radius 3, we can use the triangle formed by points J, K, and L.

- **Triangle JKL:**
  - JK = 3 (since KJ = 3)
  - JL = x (we need to find this)
  - KL = 3 (since KL = 3)

- **Using the Triangle Inequality:**
  - JG = 6
  - Since L is on the circle centered at J, JL must satisfy the equation:
    \[
    (JL)^2 + (LG)^2 = (JG)^2
    \]
  - Since LG = 1 (radius of circle centered at G), we have:
    \[
    (JL)^2 + 1^2 = 6^2
    \]
    \[
    (JL)^2 + 1 = 36
    \]
    \[
    (JL)^2 = 35
    \]
    \[
    JL = \sqrt{35}
    \]

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The closest answer choice to \(\sqrt{35} \approx 5.92\) is 5.

**Step 7: Select the Closest Answer Choice**

- The closest answer choice to \(\sqrt{35}\) is 5.

**Final Answer: A**

</think>

**Solution**

Given the geometric constraints and calculations, the measure of \( JL \) is approximately \( \sqrt{35} \approx 5.92 \). The closest answer choice is 5. Therefore, the final answer is:
