**Step 1: Analyze the given geometric constraints**

- \( \text{Length of } CE = 16 \)
- \( \text{Length of } AB = 20 \)
- \( \text{Length of } AD = 18 \)
- Point \( E \) lies on line \( AD \)
- Line \( CE \) is perpendicular to line \( ED \)

**Step 2: Understand the configuration**

Given these constraints, we need to identify the parallelogram's sides to calculate its perimeter. The problem involves point \( E \) on line \( AD \) and \( CE \) perpendicular to \( ED \). This suggests that \( C, E, D \) form a right triangle where \( CE \) is one leg, and \( ED \) is the other leg.

**Step 3: Identify the parallelogram**

To determine the sides of the parallelogram, we need to find the lengths of \( CD \) and \( DA \). Since \( E \) lies on \( AD \) and \( CE \) is perpendicular to \( ED \), \( CED \) forms a right triangle. We know \( CE = 16 \) and need to find \( ED \).

**Step 4: Use the Pythagorean theorem**

In right triangle \( CED \):

\[
CD^2 = CE^2 + ED^2
\]

Since \( AD = 18 \) and \( E \) lies on \( AD \), let \( AE = x \) and \( ED = 18 - x \).

**Step 5: Use the perpendicular condition**

Since \( CE \) is perpendicular to \( ED \), we can use the Pythagorean theorem:

\[
CD^2 = 16^2 + (18-x)^2
\]

**Step 6: Determine the parallelogram sides**

The parallelogram is formed by points \( A, B, C, D \). We know:

- \( AB = 20 \)
- \( AD = 18 \)

Since \( C \) and \( D \) are endpoints of the diagonal \( CD \), and \( CE \) is perpendicular to \( ED \), \( CD \) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle \( CED \).

**Step 7: Calculate \( CD \)**

Using the Pythagorean theorem:

\[
CD^2 = 16^2 + (18-x)^2
\]

To find \( x \), note that \( E \) divides \( AD \) such that \( CE \) is perpendicular to \( ED \). Since \( E \) is on \( AD \), and \( CE \) is perpendicular, \( E \) is the foot of the perpendicular from \( C \) to \( AD \).

Using similar triangles or coordinate geometry, we can find \( x \) by setting up the equation for the right triangle:

\[
16^2 + (18-x)^2 = CD^2
\]

Since \( CD \) is a side of the parallelogram, and \( AB = CD = 20 \) (opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal), we can solve:

\[
CD = 20
\]

**Step 8: Calculate the perimeter**

The perimeter \( P \) of the parallelogram is given by:

\[
P = 2(AB + AD) = 2(20 + 18) = 2 \times 38 = 76
\]

**Step 9: Compare with answer choices**

The calculated perimeter is 76, which matches choice C.

**Step 10: Finalize the answer**

The closest and correct answer choice is C.
