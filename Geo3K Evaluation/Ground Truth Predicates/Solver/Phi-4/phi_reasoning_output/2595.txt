1. **Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints:**
   - We have points \( D, S, C, B, R \) with various line and circle constraints.
   - The diameter of circle \(\odot S\) is 30 units, giving a radius of 15 units.
   - The diameter of circle \(\odot R\) is 20 units, giving a radius of 10 units.
   - \( DS = 9 \) units is given.
   - Various points lie on specific lines and circles.

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find \( RC \).

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
   - Since \( D, S, C \) lie on line \( CB \) and circle \(\odot S\), they are collinear and equidistant from \( S \) with radius 15.
   - \( D \) lies on circle \(\odot R\) with radius 10.
   - \( C \) lies on circle \(\odot S\) with radius 15.

4. **Calculate Using Given Information:**
   - Since \( D \) lies on both \(\odot R\) and \(\odot S\), and \( DS = 9 \), we can use the power of a point theorem or coordinate geometry to find relationships.
   - Assume \( S \) is at the origin \((0, 0)\) for simplicity.
   - \( D \) is 9 units from \( S \), so \( D \) could be at \((9, 0)\) or \((-9, 0)\).
   - Since \( D \) is on \(\odot R\) with radius 10, the distance from \( R \) to \( D \) is 10.

5. **Positioning \( R \) and \( C \):**
   - Assume \( R \) is at \((x, y)\).
   - Distance \( RD = 10 \) gives \(\sqrt{(x-9)^2 + y^2} = 10\).
   - Distance \( RS = 10 \) gives \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 10\).

6. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - From \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 10\), we have \( x^2 + y^2 = 100 \).
   - From \(\sqrt{(x-9)^2 + y^2} = 10\), we have \((x-9)^2 + y^2 = 100\).
   - Expanding \((x-9)^2 + y^2 = 100\) gives \( x^2 - 18x + 81 + y^2 = 100 \).
   - Substitute \( x^2 + y^2 = 100 \) into the equation: \( 100 - 18x + 81 = 100 \).
   - Simplify to find \( 18x = 81 \), so \( x = 4.5 \).

7. **Find \( y \):**
   - Substitute \( x = 4.5 \) into \( x^2 + y^2 = 100 \):
   - \( (4.5)^2 + y^2 = 100 \) gives \( 20.25 + y^2 = 100 \).
   - \( y^2 = 79.75 \), so \( y = \sqrt{79.75} \).

8. **Position \( C \) on \(\odot S\):**
   - \( C \) is on \(\odot S\) with radius 15, so \(\sqrt{c_x^2 + c_y^2} = 15\).
   - \( C \) is also on line \( CB \), which is collinear with \( D \) and \( S \).

9. **Calculate \( RC \):**
   - Assume \( C \) is at \((c_x, c_y)\) such that \(\sqrt{c_x^2 + c_y^2} = 15\).
   - Use the coordinates of \( R \) \((4.5, \sqrt{79.75})\) to find \( RC \).
   - \( RC = \sqrt{(c_x - 4.5)^2 + (c_y - \sqrt{79.75})^2} \).

10. **Simplify and Compare:**
    - Since \( C \) is on \(\odot S\) and \( R \) is on the line through \( S \) and \( D \), the symmetry and constraints suggest \( RC \) is a simple distance.
    - By symmetry and constraints, \( RC \) is likely to be the remaining distance from \( R \) to the circle \(\odot S\) after accounting for \( RD = 9 \).
    - \( RC = 15 - 9 = 6 \).

11. **Verify and Conclude:**
    - Check calculations and constraints to ensure consistency.
    - The closest answer choice to 6 is \( B \).
