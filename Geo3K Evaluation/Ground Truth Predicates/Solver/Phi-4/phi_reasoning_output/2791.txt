**Step 1: Analyze the given geometric constraints**
- We are given several points: J, K, G, H, F, and A.
- J, K, G, H all lie on a circle centered at A with radius 3.0.
- J and K lie on a line segment FJ with length a.
- G lies on line HF.
- The distances FG = 18, GH = 42, and FK = 15 are given.

**Step 2: Summarize relevant findings**
- Since J, K, G, H are on a circle with radius 3.0 centered at A, they all lie on a circle with a fixed radius.
- FG = 18, GH = 42, FK = 15 are critical distances that will help in determining the length a (J to K).

**Step 3: Explore geometric relationships and properties**
- Given that points J, K lie on line FJ, and the distance FK = 15, we need to explore how FJ relates to FK and a.
- Since J, K, G, H lie on the circle, we might use properties of circles and distances.
- Consider the possibility that the distances might form parts of a right triangle or involve the Pythagorean theorem.

**Step 4: Verification and calculations**
- Since J and K are on the circle, and K is on line FJ, we have:
  - FK = 15, which suggests K is 15 units from F along FJ.
- Since J, K are on the same line and the length of JK = a, we need to determine the position of J relative to F.
- Since G lies on HF and FJ, and H is 42 units from G, G could be part of a right triangle with F and H.

**Step 5: Apply the Pythagorean theorem**
- Consider triangle FGH with FG = 18, GH = 42.
- Calculate FH using the Pythagorean theorem:
  \[
  FH = \sqrt{FG^2 + GH^2} = \sqrt{18^2 + 42^2} = \sqrt{324 + 1764} = \sqrt{2088}
  \]
  \[
  FH = \sqrt{2088} = \sqrt{4 \times 522} = 2\sqrt{522}
  \]
  Approximating \(\sqrt{522}\) gives approximately 22.85, so \(FH \approx 45.7\).

**Step 6: Reassess the position of J and K**
- Since FK = 15, and J, K lie on the circle with radius 3.0, the line FJ must be such that J is 3 units from A, and K is also 3 units from A.
- The length of JF must be such that K is 15 units from F, and J is a units from K.

**Step 7: Calculate a using circle properties**
- Since J and K are both 3 units from A, and lie on FJ, the maximum possible distance JK can be is when J and K are on opposite sides of F along the circle's diameter.
- If J is on one side of F and K on the other, then:
  - JF + FK = a + 15 = diameter of the circle (since J and K are endpoints of a diameter through F).
  - The diameter of the circle is 6 (since radius is 3).
  - Thus, a + 15 = 6, solving for a gives:
  \[
  a = 6 - 15 = -9
  \]
  - This is not possible, so reconsider the configuration.

**Step 8: Correct configuration**
- Since J and K are on the circle, and FJ is a line, consider J and K as endpoints of a chord through F.
- The maximum possible JK when both are 3 units from A and F is between them:
  - JK = |JF - FK| = |a - 15|
  - Since J and K are 3 units from A, and F is on the line, the only configuration that fits is when JF = 18 (since FG = 18 and G is on FJ).
  - Thus, JK = |18 - 15| = 3.

**Step 9: Final assessment**
- Reassess the configuration: JF = 18, FK = 15, JK = a.
- Since JF = 18, and K is 15 from F, J and K are on opposite sides of F:
  - JK = |18 - 15| = 3.
- However, since J and K must be 3 units from A, and FJ is a line:
  - JF = 18, FK = 15, JK = a = 18 - 15 = 3.
  - But since JK must be the length a, and J and K are on the circle, the correct configuration is:
  - JF = 18, FK = 15, JK = a = 18.

**Step 10: Conclusion**
- The correct value of a, considering all constraints and configurations, is 15.

**Solution:**
- The correct answer is B. 18, based on the geometric constraints and calculations.
