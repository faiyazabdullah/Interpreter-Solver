### Thought Process

1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - Points \( P, Q, R, S \) form a rhombus inscribed in a circle.
   - Each point \( P, Q, R, S \) lies on the circle with center \( C \) and radius \( 4.0 \).
   - Lines \( RP \) and \( SQ \) intersect at \( C \).
   - We need to find the measure of \( \widehat{SP} \).

2. **Understand the Geometry:**
   - A rhombus inscribed in a circle is also a cyclic quadrilateral.
   - In a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles are supplementary.
   - Since it is a rhombus, all sides are equal, and diagonals bisect each other at right angles.

3. **Properties of Rhombus and Circle:**
   - The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at \( 90^\circ \).
   - The diagonals of a rhombus inscribed in a circle are also diameters of the circle.

4. **Calculate the Angles:**
   - Since \( P, Q, R, S \) are on the circle, \( \angle PRS \) and \( \angle PQS \) are angles subtended by the same arc.
   - The diagonals \( PR \) and \( QS \) are diameters, so they subtend angles of \( 90^\circ \) at the circumference.
   - Therefore, \( \angle PRS = \angle PQS = 90^\circ \).

5. **Determine \( \widehat{SP} \):**
   - Since \( \angle PRS = 90^\circ \), and \( \angle PRS \) is subtended by arc \( PS \), the arc \( PS \) is \( 180^\circ \).
   - \( \widehat{SP} \) is half of the arc \( PS \) because it is an inscribed angle.
   - Therefore, \( \widehat{SP} = \frac{180^\circ}{2} = 90^\circ \).

6. **Verification:**
   - The diagonals of the rhombus being diameters confirm that \( \angle SPR = 90^\circ \).
   - This matches the calculated \( \widehat{SP} = 90^\circ \).

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The measure of \( \widehat{SP} \) is \( 90^\circ \).

</think>

**Solution:**
Given that \( P, Q, R, S \) form a rhombus inscribed in a circle, the diagonals \( PR \) and \( QS \) are diameters of the circle. This makes the angles subtended by these diameters at the circumference \( 90^\circ \). Therefore, the angle \( \widehat{SP} \), which is subtended by the arc \( PS \), is \( 90^\circ \).
