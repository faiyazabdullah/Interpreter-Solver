**Step 1: Analyzing the given geometric constraints**
- We have several points lying on various lines:
  - \(D\) is on \( \overline{BC} \)
  - \(F\) is on \( \overline{BA} \)
  - \(Q\) is on \( \overline{BE} \)
  - \(E\) is on \( \overline{CA} \)
  - \(Q\) is on \( \overline{CF} \)
  - \(Q\) is on \( \overline{AD} \)

**Step 2: Understanding the centroid property**
- The centroid \(Q\) of a triangle is the point where its medians intersect.
- Each median of a triangle divides the triangle into two smaller triangles of equal area and the centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex.

**Step 3: Identifying the triangle for the centroid**
- \(Q\) is the centroid of triangle \(\triangle ACF\) because:
  - \(Q\) lies on \( \overline{AD} \) (median from \(A\) to \( \overline{CF}\))
  - \(Q\) lies on \( \overline{BE} \) (median from \(B\) to \( \overline{CA}\))
  - \(Q\) lies on \( \overline{CF} \) (median from \(C\) to \( \overline{AF}\))

**Step 4: Applying the centroid property to solve for \(BQ\)**
- Given \(BE = 9\), \(Q\) divides \( \overline{BE} \) in the ratio 2:1.
- Therefore, the length \(BQ\) (the longer segment) is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the entire median \(BE\).

**Step 5: Calculating \(BQ\)**
- Since \(BE = 9\), \(BQ = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6\).

**Step 6: Comparing with answer choices**
- The calculated value of \(BQ\) is 6, which corresponds to option B.

**Step 7: Verification**
- The calculations follow directly from the property of the centroid dividing each median in a 2:1 ratio.
- The constraints and conditions given in the problem are consistent with this calculation.

<Solution>
The point \(Q\) is the centroid of \(\triangle ACF\), and it divides the median \( \overline{BE} \) into a 2:1 ratio. Given \(BE = 9\), the segment \(BQ\), being the longer segment, is calculated as \(\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6\). Thus, the correct answer choice is \(B\).

Final Answer: B
