### Thought Section

1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have an equilateral triangle \( \triangle LMN \).
   - The length of \( \overline{MN} \) is given by \( 4x - 2 \).
   - The length of \( \overline{LM} \) is given by \( 3x + 1 \).
   - \( M \) is the midpoint of \( \overline{LN} \), implying \( \overline{LM} = \overline{MN} \).
   - \( \angle LPM = 5y \) and \( P \) lies on \( \overline{LN} \).

2. **Summarize Relevant Findings:**
   - Since \( \triangle LMN \) is equilateral, all sides are equal: \( \overline{LM} = \overline{MN} = \overline{LN} \).
   - Given \( M \) is the midpoint of \( \overline{LN} \), \( \overline{LM} = \overline{MN} \).

3. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From \( \overline{LM} = \overline{MN} \), we have:
     \[
     3x + 1 = 4x - 2
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     3x + 1 = 4x - 2 \\
     1 + 2 = 4x - 3x \\
     3 = x
     \]

4. **Calculate the Side Length:**
   - Substitute \( x = 3 \) into either expression for the side length:
     \[
     \overline{MN} = 4x - 2 = 4(3) - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10
     \]
   - Verify with \( \overline{LM} \):
     \[
     \overline{LM} = 3x + 1 = 3(3) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10
     \]
   - Both calculations confirm the side length is 10.

5. **Verify Consistency:**
   - Since \( \triangle LMN \) is equilateral, all sides are indeed equal, and the calculations are consistent with the given conditions.

6. **Reassess and Reflect:**
   - The problem is consistent with the properties of an equilateral triangle.
   - The calculations align with the given constraints and the properties of the triangle.

7. **Select the Closest Answer:**
   - The calculated side length is 10, which matches one of the answer choices directly.

### Solution Section

- The side length of \( \triangle LMN \) is calculated to be 10.
- The answer choice that matches this calculation is \( \text{B. } 10 \).
