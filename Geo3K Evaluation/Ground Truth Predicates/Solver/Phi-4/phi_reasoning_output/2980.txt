**Step 1: Analyze the given geometric constraints**

- **LengthOf(Line(Y, X)) = 6:** This tells us that the distance between points Y and X is 6 units.
- **MeasureOf(Angle(Z, X, Y)) = 75 degrees:** The angle formed at point X between lines ZX and XY is 75 degrees.
- **PointLiesOnCircle(Z, Circle(X, radius_2_0)) and PointLiesOnCircle(Y, Circle(X, radius_2_0)):** Both points Z and Y lie on a circle centered at X with a radius of 2.0 units.

**Step 2: Identify what needs to be found**

- We need to find the length of the arc \( \widehat{ZY} \) on the circle centered at X with a radius of 2.0 units.

**Step 3: Apply relevant geometric theorems and formulas**

- The arc length \( \widehat{ZY} \) can be calculated using the formula for the arc length of a circle: 
  \[
  \text{Arc Length} = r \cdot \theta
  \]
  where \( r \) is the radius of the circle, and \( \theta \) is the central angle in radians.

- Convert the angle from degrees to radians:
  \[
  \theta = 75^\circ \times \frac{\pi}{180^\circ} = \frac{75\pi}{180} = \frac{5\pi}{12} \text{ radians}
  \]

- Substitute the values into the arc length formula:
  \[
  \text{Arc Length} = 2.0 \times \frac{5\pi}{12}
  \]

- Calculate the arc length:
  \[
  \text{Arc Length} = \frac{10\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{6}
  \]

- Approximate the value of \( \pi \) as 3.14159:
  \[
  \text{Arc Length} \approx \frac{5 \times 3.14159}{6} \approx \frac{15.70795}{6} \approx 2.61799
  \]

**Step 4: Compare the calculated result with the given answer choices**

- The calculated arc length is approximately 2.62.
- The closest answer choice to 2.62 is 3.93.

**Step 5: Select the closest answer**

- Given the calculated arc length and the provided choices, the closest option is 3.93.
