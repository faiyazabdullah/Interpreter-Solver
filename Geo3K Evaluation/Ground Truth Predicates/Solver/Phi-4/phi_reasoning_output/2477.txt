**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**
- We have a circle centered at point \(D\) with radius \(1.0\).
- Points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) lie on this circle.
- The measure of \(\angle ADC\) is given as \(122^\circ\).

**Step 2: Summarize the Problem**
- We need to find the measure of \(\angle B\), which we interpret as \(\angle ABC\) because it's the only angle involving point \(B\) that can be derived from the given information.

**Step 3: Apply Geometric Theorems and Properties**
- Since \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) lie on the circle with center \(D\), they form a cyclic quadrilateral \(ABCD\).
- In a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum up to \(180^\circ\).
- We know \(\angle ADC = 122^\circ\). Therefore, \(\angle ABC + \angle ADC = 180^\circ\).

**Step 4: Calculate \(\angle ABC\)**
- Using the property of cyclic quadrilaterals:
  \[
  \angle ABC + 122^\circ = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  \angle ABC = 180^\circ - 122^\circ = 58^\circ
  \]

**Step 5: Verify and Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated measure of \(\angle ABC\) is \(58^\circ\).
- Compare this with the given answer choices: A. 29, B. 58, C. 61, D. 122.
- The closest and exact match is choice B: 58.

**Step 6: Conclusion**
- The calculations align with the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and the given constraints.
- Therefore, the correct answer is B.

**Solution:**

Given the geometric constraints and the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals, we determined that \(\angle ABC\) is \(58^\circ\). This matches choice B from the provided options.
