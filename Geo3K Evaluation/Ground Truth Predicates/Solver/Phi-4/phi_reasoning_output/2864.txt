### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints
We are provided with the lengths of three segments and the fact that two lines are perpendicular:
- \( NP = 15 \)
- \( MN = 39 \)
- \( MP = 36 \)
- \( \text{Perpendicular}(PN, PM) \)

#### Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings
The perpendicularity implies that \(\triangle MNP\) is a right triangle with \(\angle NMP = 90^\circ\). Therefore, \(MN\) is the hypotenuse.

#### Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem
In right triangle \(MNP\), by the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
MN^2 = MP^2 + NP^2
\]
Substitute the given values:
\[
39^2 = 36^2 + 15^2
\]
Calculate each term:
\[
1521 = 1296 + 225
\]
\[
1521 = 1521
\]
The equation holds true, confirming the triangle is indeed a right triangle.

#### Step 4: Determine \(\cos N\)
In \(\triangle MNP\), \(\angle N\) is opposite to \(MP\) and adjacent to \(NP\). Therefore:
\[
\cos N = \frac{\text{Adjacent side to } N}{\text{Hypotenuse}} = \frac{NP}{MN} = \frac{15}{39}
\]

#### Step 5: Calculate \(\cos N\) as a Decimal
\[
\cos N = \frac{15}{39} \approx 0.3846
\]
Round to the nearest hundredth:
\[
\cos N \approx 0.38
\]

#### Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated value of \(\cos N\) is approximately 0.38. Comparing this with the provided answer choices:
- A. 0.38
- B. 0.42
- C. 0.92
- D. 2.40

The closest value is 0.38.

### Solution
The correct answer choice, based on the calculations and rounding, is A. 0.38.
