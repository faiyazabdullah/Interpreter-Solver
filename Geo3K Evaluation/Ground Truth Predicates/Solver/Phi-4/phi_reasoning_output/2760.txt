**Step 1: Analyzing the Geometric Constraints**

- We are given that point \( A \) lies on multiple lines: \( \overline{GP} \) and \( \overline{FD} \).
- Several points lie on a circle with center \( A \) and radius \( 1.0 \): \( G, L, P, F, \) and \( D \).
- The line segments \( \overline{DG} \) and \( \overline{FP} \) are diameters of the circle centered at \( A \).
- The length of the diameter \( \overline{DF} \) is given as 10.

**Step 2: Understanding the Circle and Diameters**

- The circle has center \( A \) and several points on the circle, including \( G, P, F, \) and \( D \).
- Since \( \overline{DG} \) and \( \overline{FP} \) are diameters, both must pass through the center \( A \).
- The length of a diameter of a circle is twice the radius. Therefore, \( DF = 2r \), where \( r \) is the radius of the circle.

**Step 3: Calculating the Radius**

- Given \( DF = 10 \), we have \( 2r = 10 \).
- Solving for \( r \), we get \( r = 5 \).

**Step 4: Determining \( DA \)**

- Since \( A \) is the center of the circle and \( D \) is a point on the circle, the distance \( DA \) is the radius of the circle.
- From the calculation, \( DA = r = 5 \).

**Step 5: Comparing with Answer Choices**

- The calculated distance \( DA = 5 \) matches answer choice A.

**Step 6: Conclusion**

- The calculations align with the given constraints and the properties of circles.
- The closest and correct answer choice is A.

**Solution**

Given the geometric constraints and calculations, the radius of the circle centered at \( A \) is 5. Therefore, the distance \( DA \) is equal to the radius, which is 5. This matches answer choice A.
