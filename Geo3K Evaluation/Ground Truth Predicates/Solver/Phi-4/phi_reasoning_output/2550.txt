**Step 1: Understand the Problem and Given Information**

We are dealing with a rhombus \(ABCD\). The properties of a rhombus include all sides being equal. We need to find the length of \(AD\).

**Given:**
- \(AB = 2x + 3\)
- \(BC = 5x\)

Since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, all sides are equal, thus \(AB = BC = CD = DA\).

**Step 2: Set Up the Equation Using Rhombus Properties**

Given the property of a rhombus:
\[ AB = BC \]

Substitute the given expressions:
\[ 2x + 3 = 5x \]

**Step 3: Solve for \(x\)**

Rearrange the equation:
\[ 3 = 5x - 2x \]
\[ 3 = 3x \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 1 \]

**Step 4: Find \(AD\)**

Since \(AD = AB\) in a rhombus, substitute \(x = 1\) back into the expression for \(AB\):
\[ AB = 2x + 3 = 2(1) + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5 \]

Thus, \(AD = 5\).

**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**

The calculated length of \(AD\) is 5. Check the answer choices:
- A. 1
- B. 2
- C. 4
- D. 5

The calculated result matches option D.

**Step 6: Verify and Conclude**

Verify that all steps align with the properties of a rhombus and the given conditions. The calculations are correct, and the solution is consistent with the problem's constraints.

**Solution:**

1. From the properties of a rhombus, we know \(AB = BC\).
2. Set up the equation \(2x + 3 = 5x\).
3. Solve for \(x\) to get \(x = 1\).
4. Substitute \(x = 1\) into \(AB = 2x + 3\) to find \(AD = 5\).
5. Compare with the answer choices and select D.
