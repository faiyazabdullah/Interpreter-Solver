1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - Quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is a rhombus.
   - In a rhombus, all sides are equal. Therefore, \(AB = BC = CD = DA\).
   - We are given \(AB = 2x + 3\) and \(BC = x + 7\).

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the length of \(CD\), which, due to the properties of a rhombus, will be equal to the other sides (\(AB\) and \(BC\)).

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Properties:**
   - Since all sides of a rhombus are equal, set the expressions for \(AB\) and \(BC\) equal to each other:
     \[
     2x + 3 = x + 7
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Subtract \(x\) from both sides:
     \[
     2x - x + 3 = 7
     \]
     \[
     x + 3 = 7
     \]
   - Subtract 3 from both sides:
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

5. **Calculate the Length of \(CD\):**
   - Substitute \(x = 4\) back into either expression for the side lengths:
     - Using \(AB = 2x + 3\):
       \[
       AB = 2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
       \]
     - Using \(BC = x + 7\):
       \[
       BC = 4 + 7 = 11
       \]
   - Since \(AB = BC = CD\), \(CD = 11\).

6. **Verify the Calculations:**
   - Both methods of calculating \(AB\) and \(BC\) give the same result, confirming the correctness of the solution.

7. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated length of \(CD\) is 11.
   - Among the answer choices, 11 corresponds to option B.

8. **Final Decision:**
   - Based on the calculations and verification, the correct answer is option B.

**Solution:**

To find the length of \(CD\) in the rhombus \(ABCD\), we used the property that all sides of a rhombus are equal. We set the expressions for \(AB\) and \(BC\) equal to each other and solved for \(x\), finding \(x = 4\). Substituting back, we found that each side of the rhombus, including \(CD\), is 11 units long. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
