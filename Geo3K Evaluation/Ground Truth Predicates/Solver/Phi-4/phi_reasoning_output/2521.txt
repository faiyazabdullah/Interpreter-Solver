**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

We are given a triangle \( \triangle RST \) with the following sides:
- \( RS = x + 9 \)
- \( ST = 2x \)
- \( RT = 3x - 9 \)

We are also told that \( \triangle RST \) is an equilateral triangle. In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal.

**Step 2: Set Up Equations Based on Equilateral Triangle Property**

Since \( \triangle RST \) is equilateral, we have:
1. \( RS = ST \)
2. \( ST = RT \)
3. \( RT = RS \)

**Step 3: Formulate Equations**

From \( RS = ST \):
\[ x + 9 = 2x \]

From \( ST = RT \):
\[ 2x = 3x - 9 \]

From \( RT = RS \):
\[ 3x - 9 = x + 9 \]

**Step 4: Solve the Equations**

Let's solve each equation:

1. \( x + 9 = 2x \)
   \[
   9 = 2x - x \\
   9 = x
   \]

2. \( 2x = 3x - 9 \)
   \[
   2x - 3x = -9 \\
   -x = -9 \\
   x = 9
   \]

3. \( 3x - 9 = x + 9 \)
   \[
   3x - x = 9 + 9 \\
   2x = 18 \\
   x = 9
   \]

**Step 5: Verify Consistency**

All three equations give \( x = 9 \). This is consistent across all equations, confirming that \( x = 9 \) satisfies the condition of the triangle being equilateral.

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**

The calculated value \( x = 9 \) matches one of the answer choices, specifically choice C.

**Step 7: Finalize the Solution**

Since all calculations consistently lead to \( x = 9 \), and this matches choice C, we select this as the final answer.

</think>

**Solution:**

Given the constraints and the property of the equilateral triangle, solving the equations derived from setting the sides equal confirms that \( x = 9 \). This value satisfies all conditions for the triangle to be equilateral.

Final Answer: C
