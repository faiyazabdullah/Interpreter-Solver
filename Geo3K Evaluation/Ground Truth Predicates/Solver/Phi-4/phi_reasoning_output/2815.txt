**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**
- We have a triangle with sides \(AB = 12\) and \(AC = 7\). Let's denote the third side as \(BC = x\).
- We need to determine which of the given options cannot be the perimeter of this triangle.

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**
- The perimeter of the triangle is \(P = 12 + 7 + x = 19 + x\).
- The triangle inequality theorem states that for any triangle with sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
  - \(a + b > c\)
  - \(a + c > b\)
  - \(b + c > a\)

**Step 3: Apply the Triangle Inequality Theorem**
- Applying the triangle inequality theorem to sides \(12\), \(7\), and \(x\):
  1. \(12 + 7 > x \Rightarrow x < 19\)
  2. \(12 + x > 7 \Rightarrow x > -5\) (This is always true since \(x\) is positive)
  3. \(7 + x > 12 \Rightarrow x > 5\)

- Combining these, we get \(5 < x < 19\).

**Step 4: Calculate Possible Perimeters**
- The perimeter \(P = 19 + x\) must satisfy \(5 < x < 19\).
- Therefore, the range for \(P\) is:
  - Minimum \(P = 19 + 5 = 24\)
  - Maximum \(P = 19 + 19 = 38\)
- Thus, the possible range for the perimeter is \(24 < P < 38\).

**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**
- A. 29: This is within the range \(24 < P < 38\).
- B. 34: This is within the range \(24 < P < 38\).
- C. 37: This is within the range \(24 < P < 38\).
- D. 38: This is not within the range \(24 < P < 38\) because \(P\) must be strictly less than 38.

**Step 6: Verify and Select the Correct Answer**
- Since the perimeter cannot be 38, option D is the correct choice.

**Solution**

Based on the analysis using the triangle inequality theorem, the perimeter of the triangle must be strictly between 24 and 38. Among the given options, 38 is not possible as it is outside this range. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: D
