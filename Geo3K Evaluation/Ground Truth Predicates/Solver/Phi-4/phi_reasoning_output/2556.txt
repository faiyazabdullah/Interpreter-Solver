**Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Constraints**

- We are given several lengths:
  - \( AF = x \)
  - \( CF = 6 \)
  - \( AE = 8 \)
  - \( BE = 8 \)

- Points \( F \), \( D \), and \( E \) lie on certain lines:
  - \( F \) is on line \( CA \)
  - \( D \) is on line \( CB \)
  - \( E \) is on line \( AB \)

- Points \( D \), \( E \), and \( F \) lie on the same circle centered at \( C \) with radius \( r \).

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**

- Since \( D \), \( E \), and \( F \) are on the circle centered at \( C \), they are equidistant from \( C \). Thus, \( CD = CE = CF = r \).

- Given \( CF = 6 \), it follows that \( r = 6 \).

- Since \( E \) is on the circle centered at \( C \), \( CE = 6 \).

**Step 3: Explore Geometric Properties**

- Since \( E \) is on line \( AB \) and \( CE = 6 \), and \( AE = 8 \), we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \( CAE \) because \( C \), \( A \), and \( E \) form a right triangle (since \( E \) is on the circle and \( CE \) is a radius).

- Let \( AC = a \). Then, by the Pythagorean theorem:
  \[
  a^2 + 8^2 = 6^2
  \]
  \[
  a^2 + 64 = 36
  \]
  \[
  a^2 = 36 - 64 = -28
  \]
  This is not possible, indicating a misinterpretation. Let's reconsider the setup.

**Step 4: Reassess the Setup**

- Since \( E \) is on the circle and \( AE = 8 \), \( BE = 8 \), \( AB \) is a chord of the circle.

- \( E \) is the midpoint of \( AB \) because \( AE = BE \).

- \( C \) is the center, and \( CE = 6 \). The perpendicular from \( C \) to \( AB \) bisects \( AB \).

**Step 5: Calculate \( AB \) Using the Right Triangle**

- In the right triangle \( CEM \) (where \( M \) is the midpoint of \( AB \)):
  \[
  CM^2 + ME^2 = CE^2
  \]
  \[
  CM^2 + 4^2 = 6^2
  \]
  \[
  CM^2 + 16 = 36
  \]
  \[
  CM^2 = 20
  \]
  \[
  CM = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5}
  \]

- Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( AB \), \( AM = MB = 4 \).

**Step 6: Determine \( AC \) and \( AF \)**

- In triangle \( CAF \), \( CF = 6 \) and \( AF = x \).

- Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \( CAF \):
  \[
  CA^2 + AF^2 = CF^2
  \]
  \[
  a^2 + x^2 = 36
  \]

- We need to find \( a \) using the previous setup:
  - \( a^2 + 16 = 36 \) (since \( AM = 4 \) and \( M \) is the midpoint of \( AB \))
  - \( a^2 = 20 \)
  - \( a = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5} \)

- Substitute \( a = 2\sqrt{5} \) into the equation:
  \[
  (2\sqrt{5})^2 + x^2 = 36
  \]
  \[
  20 + x^2 = 36
  \]
  \[
  x^2 = 16
  \]
  \[
  x = 4
  \]

**Step 7: Verify and Compare**

- The calculated value of \( x \) is 4, which matches option A.

**Step 8: Final Reflection and Conclusion**

- All calculations align with the given constraints and the properties of the circle and lines.
- The closest answer choice to our calculated value is 4.

**Solution**

Based on the analysis and calculations, the value of \( x \) is determined to be 4. This matches option A.
