### Analyzing the Given Geometric Constraints
1. **Inscribed Square in a Circle**: The problem states that square \(ABDC\) is inscribed in a circle \(\odot K\). This implies that all four vertices of the square lie on the circle. For a square inscribed in a circle, the diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle.

2. **Central Angle**: We are tasked with finding the measure of a central angle. Since the square is inscribed, central angles subtended by the sides of the square are of interest.

3. **Properties of Inscribed Figures**: A square inscribed in a circle has its vertices equally spaced on the circle. This means the circle is divided into four equal arcs by the vertices of the square.

4. **Angle Calculation**:
   - The full circle measures \(360^\circ\).
   - Since the square divides the circle into four equal parts, each central angle subtended by a side of the square is \(\frac{360^\circ}{4} = 90^\circ\).

5. **Verification**:
   - The diagonals of the square intersect at the center of the circle and are perpendicular, confirming the symmetry and equal division of the circle.
   - Each central angle subtended by a side of the square is indeed \(90^\circ\).

### Summarizing Relevant Findings
- The square divides the circle into four equal arcs.
- Each arc corresponds to a central angle of \(90^\circ\).

### Exploring New Ideas
- Consider if there are any other interpretations or additional constraints that might affect the central angle.
- Reassess the problem to ensure no additional geometric properties are overlooked.

### Reassessing Accuracy
- Recheck the properties of an inscribed square and the division of the circle.
- Confirm that the central angle calculation is consistent with the geometric properties.

### Refining Errors
- Ensure no misinterpretation of the problem statement or geometric properties.
- Verify that the central angle is indeed subtended by a side of the square.

### Revisiting Previous Steps
- Confirm the initial understanding of the problem and the geometric setup.
- Reaffirm the division of the circle into four equal parts by the square.

### Iteration
- Reiterate the calculation of the central angle to ensure consistency and correctness.

<Solution>

Given that square \(ABDC\) is inscribed in circle \(\odot K\), each side of the square subtends a central angle at the center of the circle. Since the square divides the circle into four equal parts, each central angle is:

\[
\frac{360^\circ}{4} = 90^\circ
\]

Thus, the measure of a central angle subtended by a side of the square is \(90^\circ\).

Comparing this result with the given answer choices:
- A. 45
- B. 60
- C. 90
- D. 180

The correct choice is \(90^\circ\), which corresponds to option C.
