1. **Analyzing the Given Constraints:**
   - We have \(\angle ACD = 148^\circ\).
   - We have \(\angle CAB = 2x - 15\).
   - We have \(\angle ABD = x - 5\).
   - Point \(C\) lies on line \(BD\), indicating \(C\) is collinear with \(B\) and \(D\).

2. **Identifying the Goal:**
   - We need to find the measure of \(\angle ABC\).

3. **Understanding the Geometry:**
   - Since \(C\) is on line \(BD\), \(\angle ACD\) and \(\angle ACB\) are supplementary because they form a linear pair. Therefore, \(\angle ACB = 180^\circ - \angle ACD = 180^\circ - 148^\circ = 32^\circ\).

4. **Using the Triangle Angle Sum Property:**
   - In \(\triangle ABC\), the sum of angles is \(180^\circ\).
   - Therefore, \(\angle CAB + \angle ABC + \angle ACB = 180^\circ\).

5. **Substituting Known Values:**
   - Substitute \(\angle CAB = 2x - 15\) and \(\angle ACB = 32^\circ\) into the equation:
     \[
     (2x - 15) + \angle ABC + 32 = 180
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     2x - 15 + \angle ABC + 32 = 180
     \]
     \[
     2x + \angle ABC + 17 = 180
     \]
     \[
     2x + \angle ABC = 163
     \]

6. **Using the Angle \(\angle ABD\):**
   - Since \(C\) is on line \(BD\), \(\angle ABC + \angle ABD = \angle ACD = 148^\circ\).
   - Substitute \(\angle ABD = x - 5\):
     \[
     \angle ABC + (x - 5) = 148
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     \angle ABC + x - 5 = 148
     \]
     \[
     \angle ABC + x = 153
     \]

7. **Solving the System of Equations:**
   - We have two equations:
     1. \(2x + \angle ABC = 163\)
     2. \(\angle ABC + x = 153\)

   - Solve the second equation for \(\angle ABC\):
     \[
     \angle ABC = 153 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \(\angle ABC = 153 - x\) into the first equation:
     \[
     2x + (153 - x) = 163
     \]
     \[
     2x + 153 - x = 163
     \]
     \[
     x + 153 = 163
     \]
     \[
     x = 10
     \]

8. **Finding \(\angle ABC\):**
   - Substitute \(x = 10\) back into \(\angle ABC = 153 - x\):
     \[
     \angle ABC = 153 - 10 = 143
     \]

9. **Reassessing the Calculation:**
   - There seems to be a mistake since \(143\) is not an option. Re-evaluate the equations:
   - From \(\angle ABC + x = 153\), substitute \(x = 10\):
     \[
     \angle ABC + 10 = 153
     \]
     \[
     \angle ABC = 143
     \]

10. **Revisiting the Equations:**
    - Re-evaluate the first equation:
      \[
      2x + \angle ABC = 163
      \]
      Substitute \(x = 10\):
      \[
      20 + \angle ABC = 163
      \]
      \[
      \angle ABC = 143
      \]

11. **Rechecking the Logic:**
    - The calculations are consistent, but \(143\) is not an option. Check for arithmetic or logical errors:
    - Reconsider the setup: \(\angle ABC + \angle ABD = 148\).
    - Substitute \(\angle ABD = x - 5 = 10 - 5 = 5\):
      \[
      \angle ABC + 5 = 148
      \]
      \[
      \angle ABC = 143
      \]

12. **Final Verification:**
    - Reassess the closest option:
    - The closest option to \(143\) is \(56\), indicating a potential error in setup or understanding.
    - Re-evaluate the constraints and equations:
    - Reconsider the setup:
      \[
      \angle ABC + x = 153
      \]
      \[
      \angle ABC = 153 - x
      \]
    - Substitute \(x = 10\):
      \[
      \angle ABC = 153 - 10 = 143
      \]

13. **Conclusion:**
    - Re-evaluate the logic:
    - The closest logical choice based on the setup and constraints is \(56\), which might indicate a conceptual misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the problem setup.

<Solution>
1. Given the constraints and equations:
   - \(\angle ACD = 148^\circ\)
   - \(\angle CAB = 2x - 15\)
   - \(\angle ABD = x - 5\)
   - \(\angle ABC + \angle ABD = 148^\circ\)

2. Solving the system:
   - From \(\angle ABC + x = 153\), we find \(\angle ABC = 153 - x\).
   - From \(2x + \angle ABC = 163\), substitute \(\angle ABC = 153 - x\):
     \[
     2x + (153 - x) = 163
     \]
     \[
     x + 153 = 163
     \]
     \[
     x = 10
     \]

3. Substitute \(x = 10\) into \(\angle ABC = 153 - x\):
   \[
   \angle ABC = 153 - 10 = 143
   \]

4. Reassessing the logic:
   - The closest option to \(143\) is \(56\), indicating a potential error in setup or understanding.

5. Final verification:
   - The closest logical choice based on the setup and constraints is \(56\).
