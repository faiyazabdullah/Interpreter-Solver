**Analyzing the Question:**

1. **Understand the Given Information:**
   - Point \( E \) lies on line \( DA \).
   - Point \( B \) lies on line \( AC \).
   - Lines \( EB \) and \( DC \) are parallel.
   - Distances: \( AB = 12 \), \( AC = 16 \), and \( ED = 5 \).

2. **Identify the Target:**
   - We need to find the distance \( AE \).

3. **Geometric Interpretation:**
   - Given \( E \) lies on \( DA \) and \( B \) lies on \( AC \), visualize \( D, A, \) and \( C \) being collinear with \( A \) as a common point.
   - Since \( EB \parallel DC \), consider the implications of parallel lines in the context of similar triangles or transversals.

4. **Use of Similar Triangles:**
   - Since \( EB \parallel DC \), triangles \( AEB \) and \( ADC \) are similar by the Basic Proportionality Theorem (also known as Thales' theorem).

5. **Set Up Proportions:**
   - From similarity, \(\frac{AE}{AD} = \frac{AB}{AC}\).
   - Given \( AB = 12 \) and \( AC = 16 \), we have \(\frac{AE}{AD} = \frac{12}{16} = \frac{3}{4}\).

6. **Express \( AD \) in Terms of \( AE \):**
   - From the proportion, \( AE = \frac{3}{4}AD \).
   - Therefore, \( AD = \frac{4}{3}AE \).

7. **Use \( ED = 5 \):**
   - Since \( E \) lies on \( DA \), \( AD = AE + ED \).
   - Substitute \( AD = \frac{4}{3}AE \) into \( AD = AE + 5 \):
     \[
     \frac{4}{3}AE = AE + 5
     \]

8. **Solve for \( AE \):**
   - Multiply through by 3 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     4AE = 3AE + 15
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     4AE - 3AE = 15
     \]
     \[
     AE = 15
     \]

9. **Verify and Compare:**
   - The calculated \( AE = 15 \).
   - Compare with the answer choices: A. 10, B. 12, C. 15, D. 16.
   - \( AE = 15 \) matches choice C.

10. **Conclusion:**
    - The calculations align with the geometric constraints and the given conditions.
    - The closest and exact match is choice C.

**Solution:**

1. From the similarity of triangles \( AEB \) and \( ADC \), we established \(\frac{AE}{AD} = \frac{3}{4}\).
2. Express \( AD \) as \( \frac{4}{3}AE \).
3. Using \( AD = AE + 5 \), substitute to get \(\frac{4}{3}AE = AE + 5\).
4. Solve the equation to find \( AE = 15 \).
5. The calculated \( AE \) matches choice C.
