1. **Analyzing the Given Information:**
   - We are given that the length of the line segment \( FJ \) is 6 units.
   - The task is to find the area of a regular polygon, but the type of polygon and its number of sides are not specified.

2. **Summarizing Relevant Findings:**
   - We know that in regular polygons, all sides are equal and all interior angles are equal.
   - The segment \( FJ \) could potentially be the side length of the polygon, or it could be a diagonal. The type of polygon will determine this.

3. **Exploration of Possibilities:**
   - Let's consider common regular polygons and the relationships between side lengths and diagonals:
     - **Equilateral Triangle:** The side is the same as the segment length.
     - **Square:** The side is the same as the segment length.
     - **Regular Pentagon, Hexagon, etc.:** The side could be the segment length, or it could be a diagonal.

4. **Verification and Calculation:**
   - **Equilateral Triangle:**
     - Side \( s = 6 \).
     - Area \( A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 6^2 = 9\sqrt{3} \approx 15.6 \).

   - **Square:**
     - Side \( s = 6 \).
     - Area \( A = s^2 = 6^2 = 36 \).

   - **Regular Pentagon:**
     - If \( FJ \) is a side, use the formula for the area of a regular pentagon:
       \[
       A = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{5(5 + 2\sqrt{5})} s^2
       \]
     - \( s = 6 \), so:
       \[
       A = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{5(5 + 2\sqrt{5})} \times 6^2 \approx 61.9
       \]

   - **Regular Hexagon:**
     - If \( FJ \) is a side, use the formula for the area of a regular hexagon:
       \[
       A = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2
       \]
     - \( s = 6 \), so:
       \[
       A = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 6^2 = 54\sqrt{3} \approx 93.5
       \]

   - **Regular Decagon:**
     - If \( FJ \) is a side, use the formula for the area of a regular decagon:
       \[
       A = \frac{5}{2} s^2 \sqrt{5 + 2\sqrt{5}}
       \]
     - \( s = 6 \), so:
       \[
       A = \frac{5}{2} \times 6^2 \sqrt{5 + 2\sqrt{5}} \approx 277.1
       \]

5. **Reassessment and Reflection:**
   - The calculated areas for different polygons do not directly match any of the given choices.
   - The closest match to one of the choices is for the regular pentagon, where the area is approximately 61.9, which rounds to 101.8 when considering the possibility of \( FJ \) being a diagonal rather than a side.

6. **Final Verification:**
   - Re-evaluate the possibility of \( FJ \) being a diagonal in a pentagon:
     - For a regular pentagon, the diagonal \( d \) is related to the side \( s \) by \( d = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} s \).
     - Solving \( 6 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} s \) gives \( s \approx 3.708 \).
     - Recalculate the area with this side length:
       \[
       A = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{5(5 + 2\sqrt{5})} \times (3.708)^2 \approx 25.5
       \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The closest match to the calculated area when considering \( FJ \) as a diagonal of a pentagon is approximately 25.5, which corresponds to choice B.

Solution:
- Based on the analysis and calculations, the area of the regular polygon, considering \( FJ \) as a diagonal of a regular pentagon, is closest to 25.5. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
