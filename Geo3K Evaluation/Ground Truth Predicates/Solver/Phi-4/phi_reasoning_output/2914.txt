**Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints**

- \( CE = 24 \)
- \( CB = 26 \)
- \( DB = 22 \)
- \( E \) lies on line \( BD \)
- \( CE \perp EB \)

**Step 2: Understand the Geometric Setup**

The problem involves points \( C, B, D, E \). The line \( CE \) is perpendicular to line \( EB \), indicating a right triangle \( CEB \) with \( CE \) and \( EB \) as the legs. Since \( E \) lies on \( BD \), \( E \) is collinear with \( B \) and \( D \).

**Step 3: Use the Pythagorean Theorem**

In right triangle \( CEB \):

\[
CB^2 = CE^2 + EB^2
\]

Substitute the known values:

\[
26^2 = 24^2 + EB^2
\]

\[
676 = 576 + EB^2
\]

\[
EB^2 = 100
\]

\[
EB = 10
\]

**Step 4: Determine the Position of \( E \) on \( BD \)**

Since \( E \) lies on \( BD \) and \( EB = 10 \), we can express \( ED \) as:

\[
ED = DB - EB = 22 - 10 = 12
\]

**Step 5: Calculate the Area of the Parallelogram**

The parallelogram is formed by vectors \( \overrightarrow{CB} \) and \( \overrightarrow{CD} \). The area of the parallelogram can be calculated using the cross product of vectors \( \overrightarrow{CB} \) and \( \overrightarrow{CD} \).

**Step 6: Find Vector \( \overrightarrow{CD} \)**

Since \( E \) is on \( BD \), \( D \) can be expressed in terms of \( B \) and \( E \):

- \( \overrightarrow{BD} = \overrightarrow{BE} + \overrightarrow{ED} \)

Since \( E \) is on the line \( BD \), \( \overrightarrow{CD} = \overrightarrow{CE} + \overrightarrow{ED} \).

**Step 7: Use the Perpendicularity**

Since \( CE \perp EB \), the area of triangle \( CEB \) is:

\[
\text{Area of } \triangle CEB = \frac{1}{2} \times CE \times EB = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 \times 10 = 120
\]

**Step 8: Calculate the Area of the Parallelogram**

The area of parallelogram \( CBED \) is twice the area of triangle \( CEB \) because \( E \) divides \( BD \) into two segments:

\[
\text{Area of parallelogram } CBED = 2 \times \text{Area of } \triangle CEB = 2 \times 120 = 240
\]

However, this calculation only accounts for half of the parallelogram formed by \( CB \) and \( CD \). We need to consider the full parallelogram formed by \( CB \) and \( CD \).

**Step 9: Correct Calculation**

Since \( CD \) is parallel to \( BE \) and \( CE \) is perpendicular to \( BE \), the full parallelogram \( CBED \) has an area:

\[
\text{Area of parallelogram } CBED = CE \times BD = 24 \times 22 = 528
\]

**Step 10: Compare with Answer Choices**

The calculated area of the parallelogram is 528, which matches choice B.

**Reassess and Reflect**

All calculations align with the geometric constraints and properties. The perpendicularity and collinearity were correctly used to determine the area.

</think>

**Solution:**

The area of the parallelogram \( CBED \) is calculated as follows:

1. Use the perpendicularity to find \( EB = 10 \).
2. Calculate \( ED = 12 \).
3. Use the full length \( BD = 22 \) to find the area of the parallelogram.
4. The area is \( CE \times BD = 24 \times 22 = 528 \).
