1. **Understanding the Given Constraints:**
   - We have several lines and points defined with specific relationships, and a circle with center I and radius 6.0.
   - Points A, B, C, D, F, J, L, M, and H lie on this circle.
   - Point D is explicitly stated as the center of the circle, implying that D coincides with I.
   - The task is to find the measure of angle ABC.

2. **Identifying Key Geometric Relationships:**
   - Since D is the center of the circle, and D coincides with I, all given points A, B, C, F, J, L, M, and H lie on the circumference of the circle centered at D.
   - The measure of angle ABC involves points A, B, and C on the circumference of the circle.

3. **Applying Geometric Theorems:**
   - The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that an angle subtended by an arc at the circumference is half the angle subtended by the same arc at the center.
   - If we consider the arc AC, the angle subtended by this arc at the center (D) would be ∠ADC. The angle subtended at the circumference by the same arc is ∠ABC.

4. **Analyzing the Circle and Points:**
   - Since D is the center, ∠ADC is a central angle.
   - If A, B, and C are points on the circle such that B is between A and C on the circle, then ∠ABC is an inscribed angle.

5. **Considering Symmetry and Possible Configurations:**
   - If A, B, and C are equally spaced on the circle, they could form an equilateral triangle inscribed in the circle.
   - In an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle, each angle is 60 degrees.

6. **Calculating the Angle:**
   - If A, B, and C form an equilateral triangle, then ∠ABC = 60 degrees.
   - This is consistent with the inscribed angle theorem, where the central angle ∠ADC would be 120 degrees (since it spans two arcs of 60 degrees each), making the inscribed angle ∠ABC half of that, or 60 degrees.

7. **Verification and Conclusion:**
   - Given the symmetry and the fact that all points lie on the circle, the most reasonable configuration is that A, B, and C form an equilateral triangle.
   - Therefore, m∠ABC is 60 degrees.

</think>
<Solution>
Based on the analysis of the geometric constraints and the application of the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the measure of angle ABC is determined to be 60 degrees. This conclusion is drawn from the assumption that A, B, and C form an equilateral triangle inscribed in the circle, which is a reasonable configuration given the symmetry and equal spacing of points on the circle.
