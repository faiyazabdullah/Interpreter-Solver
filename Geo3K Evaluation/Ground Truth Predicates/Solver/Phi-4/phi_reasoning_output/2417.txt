**Thought Process:**

1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have a circle \(\odot P\) with a radius of 5 units (as given in the constraints) and a secondary circle with a radius of 2 inches (as mentioned in the question).
   - Points \(R\), \(S\), \(T\), and \(Q\) all lie on the circle \(\odot P\) with a radius of 5 units.
   - The measure of \(\angle RPS\) is 130 degrees, and \(\angle TPQ\) is 112 degrees.
   - \(P\) is on the line \(TR\).
   - We need to find the length of the arc \(\widehat{RS}\) on the circle with a radius of 2 inches.

2. **Identify the Required Calculation:**
   - The arc length \(\widehat{RS}\) on a circle is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Arc Length} = \left(\frac{\theta}{360}\right) \times 2\pi r
     \]
     where \(\theta\) is the central angle in degrees and \(r\) is the radius of the circle.

3. **Determine the Central Angle \(\theta\):**
   - The central angle \(\theta\) corresponding to \(\angle RPS\) is 130 degrees, as \(R\), \(P\), and \(S\) are points on the circle with \(P\) as the center.

4. **Calculate the Arc Length on the Circle with Radius 2 Inches:**
   - Use the formula for arc length with \(\theta = 130\) degrees and \(r = 2\) inches:
     \[
     \text{Arc Length} = \left(\frac{130}{360}\right) \times 2\pi \times 2
     \]
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     \text{Arc Length} = \left(\frac{130}{360}\right) \times 4\pi
     \]
     \[
     \text{Arc Length} = \left(\frac{13}{36}\right) \times 4\pi
     \]
     \[
     \text{Arc Length} = \frac{52\pi}{36}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Arc Length} = \frac{13\pi}{9}
     \]

5. **Calculate the Numerical Value:**
   - Use \(\pi \approx 3.14159\):
     \[
     \text{Arc Length} \approx \frac{13 \times 3.14159}{9}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Arc Length} \approx \frac{40.84067}{9}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Arc Length} \approx 4.53896
     \]

6. **Round to the Nearest Hundredth:**
   - The arc length rounded to the nearest hundredth is approximately 4.54.

7. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated arc length of 4.54 matches choice C.

8. **Final Verification:**
   - Ensure all steps are logical and calculations are accurate. The closest answer choice is indeed 4.54.

</think>

**Solution:**

The length of the arc \(\widehat{RS}\) on the circle with a radius of 2 inches, corresponding to a central angle of 130 degrees, is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Arc Length} = \left(\frac{130}{360}\right) \times 4\pi = \frac{13\pi}{9} \approx 4.54
\]

Thus, the closest answer choice is:
