**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**
- We are given two circles:
  1. Circle with center \( A \) and radius \( r_0 = 0 \). This implies that circle is essentially a point at \( A \).
  2. Circle with center \( C \) and radius \( r_2 = 0 \). This implies that circle is essentially a point at \( C \).

- The point \( B \) lies on both these circles. Since both circles are just points (centers \( A \) and \( C \)), it implies \( B \) is coincident with both \( A \) and \( C \). Thus, \( A = B = C \).

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**
- The problem asks for the area of the shaded region. However, given that both circles are just points, the "shaded region" typically suggests an intersection or overlap between two geometric shapes. Here, the interpretation may be incorrect due to the constraint \( r_0 = 0 \) and \( r_2 = 0 \).

**Step 3: Consider Geometric Interpretation**
- Since both circles are points, there is no traditional "shaded region" between two overlapping circles. If there were any other details, like a non-zero radius or additional geometric constraints, we might consider the intersection of two circles. However, with both radii being zero, there is no overlap or intersection area.

**Step 4: Reassess the Problem Statement**
- Given the constraints, the problem might involve an implicit or external condition not stated explicitly in the problem. The problem could involve a standard geometric scenario where these circles would have non-zero radii, but they are not provided here.

**Step 5: Explore Possible Misinterpretations**
- If the problem intended to use non-zero radii, the typical approach would involve calculating the area of intersection between two circles. However, with zero radii, no such area exists.

**Step 6: Reflect on the Answer Choices**
- The answer choices provided (104.7, 157.1, 235.6, 314.2) suggest areas of circles or segments. Given the constraints, the only logical interpretation is that the problem might have intended for a standard scenario with non-zero radii.

**Step 7: Consider Standard Circle Areas**
- If we assume standard circle radii, the closest standard area calculation would be for a circle with radius \( r \) such that:
  - Area = \( \pi r^2 \).
  - For \( \pi \approx 3.14 \), the areas corresponding to the choices are:
    - \( r^2 \approx 33.3 \) for 104.7
    - \( r^2 \approx 50 \) for 157.1
    - \( r^2 \approx 75.3 \) for 235.6
    - \( r^2 \approx 100 \) for 314.2

**Step 8: Choose the Closest Logical Answer**
- Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the most logical assumption is that the problem intended for a scenario where the radii were non-zero and equal, leading to a full overlap (complete intersection) of two circles.
- The largest area choice, 314.2, corresponds to a circle with radius 10 (since \( \pi \times 10^2 = 314 \)), which is a common scenario for full overlap.

**Step 9: Finalize the Answer**
- Given the constraints and the logical deductions, the closest and most reasonable choice is the largest area, assuming a standard scenario with equal radii.

<Solution>
Based on the analysis, the problem's constraints imply a scenario where the circles are points, leading to no traditional intersection area. However, considering standard geometric interpretations and the provided answer choices, the most reasonable assumption is that the problem intended for a scenario with equal, non-zero radii leading to a full overlap. The largest area choice, 314.2, corresponds to a circle with radius 10, which is a common scenario for full overlap.
