**Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints**

- Points \(E, D, A, B\) lie on the circle centered at \(W\) with radius 2.0. This indicates that \(WE = WD = WA = WB = 2.0\).
- Point \(F\) lies on line \(ED\) and line \(FW\) is perpendicular to line \(FD\).
- Point \(C\) lies on line \(AB\) and line \(CW\) is perpendicular to line \(CB\).
- We are given that \(CW = WF\) and \(ED = 30\).

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**

We need to find \(DF\). We are given \(ED = 30\).

**Step 3: Geometric Considerations**

- Since \(E\) and \(D\) lie on the circle, and \(ED\) is a chord of the circle, we can use the properties of circles and perpendicular bisectors.
- The perpendicular from the center of a circle to a chord bisects the chord. Therefore, \(WF\) bisects \(ED\), making \(EF = FD\).
- Given \(ED = 30\), it follows that \(EF = FD = 15\).

**Step 4: Verify the Perpendicularity and Distance Conditions**

- Since \(WF\) is perpendicular to \(FD\), and \(WF = CW\), we can use the right triangle \(\triangle WFD\).
- In \(\triangle WFD\), \(WF\) is the perpendicular from \(W\) to \(FD\), and \(WF = 2\) (radius of the circle).
- Since \(WF\) bisects \(ED\), \(FD = 15\).

**Step 5: Reassess and Confirm Calculations**

- The perpendicular bisector property and the given conditions confirm that \(FD = 15\).
- No further calculations are needed as the geometric properties directly lead to this result.

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated \(DF = 15\) matches choice A.

**Step 7: Final Verification**

- All steps and geometric properties used are consistent with the given constraints and conditions.
- The closest answer to our calculated result is indeed choice A.

**Solution:**

Given the constraints and using the properties of circles and perpendicular bisectors, we determined that \(DF = 15\). This matches choice A.
