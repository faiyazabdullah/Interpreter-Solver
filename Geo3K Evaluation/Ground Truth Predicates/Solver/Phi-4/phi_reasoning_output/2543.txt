**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**

The problem provides certain geometric constraints and relationships between points and lines. We need to find the perimeter of \(\triangle BCD\), given that \(\triangle BCD \sim \triangle FDE\). The similarity means the triangles are proportional in corresponding sides.

**Step 2: Analyze Given Information**

We have the following measurements and relationships:
- \(CD = 12\)
- \(FD = 5\)
- \(FE = 4\)
- \(DE = 8\)
- \(\triangle BCD \sim \triangle FDE\)

**Step 3: Use Triangle Similarity**

Since \(\triangle BCD \sim \triangle FDE\), the sides are proportional:
\[
\frac{BC}{FD} = \frac{CD}{DE} = \frac{BD}{FE}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the Scale Factor**

Using the known side lengths \(CD = 12\) and \(DE = 8\), the scale factor \(k\) from \(\triangle FDE\) to \(\triangle BCD\) is:
\[
k = \frac{CD}{DE} = \frac{12}{8} = \frac{3}{2}
\]

**Step 5: Find Corresponding Side Lengths**

Using the scale factor \(k = \frac{3}{2}\), calculate the corresponding sides of \(\triangle BCD\):
- \(FD = 5\), so \(BC = k \times FD = \frac{3}{2} \times 5 = 7.5\)
- \(FE = 4\), so \(BD = k \times FE = \frac{3}{2} \times 4 = 6\)

**Step 6: Calculate the Perimeter of \(\triangle BCD\)**

The perimeter \(P\) of \(\triangle BCD\) is the sum of its sides:
\[
P = BC + CD + BD = 7.5 + 12 + 6 = 25.5
\]

**Step 7: Compare with Answer Choices**

The calculated perimeter is 25.5, which matches option B.

**Step 8: Conclusion**

The closest and correct answer choice is B. 25.5.

</think>

**Solution:**

1. We established the similarity ratio between \(\triangle BCD\) and \(\triangle FDE\) as \(\frac{3}{2}\).
2. Using this ratio, we calculated the corresponding sides of \(\triangle BCD\).
3. The perimeter of \(\triangle BCD\) is calculated as 25.5.
4. This matches option B.

Final Answer: B
