1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have a trapezoid \(ABCD\) with \(AB\) and \(CD\) as the parallel sides.
   - Points \(S\) and \(T\) are midpoints of the non-parallel sides \(AD\) and \(BC\) respectively.
   - \(AB = x + 4\), \(CD = 3x + 2\), and \(ST = 9\).

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the length of \(AB\).

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems:**
   - In a trapezoid, the line segment connecting the midpoints of the non-parallel sides (legs) is called the midsegment. The length of the midsegment \(ST\) is the average of the lengths of the parallel sides \(AB\) and \(CD\).
   - Formula for the midsegment: 
     \[
     ST = \frac{AB + CD}{2}
     \]

4. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Substitute the given values into the midsegment formula:
     \[
     9 = \frac{(x + 4) + (3x + 2)}{2}
     \]

5. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     9 = \frac{x + 4 + 3x + 2}{2}
     \]
     \[
     9 = \frac{4x + 6}{2}
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     18 = 4x + 6
     \]
   - Subtract 6 from both sides:
     \[
     12 = 4x
     \]
   - Divide by 4:
     \[
     x = 3
     \]

6. **Calculate \(AB\):**
   - Substitute \(x = 3\) back into the expression for \(AB\):
     \[
     AB = x + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7
     \]

7. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - Check if \(ST = 9\) with \(x = 3\):
     - \(CD = 3x + 2 = 3(3) + 2 = 9 + 2 = 11\)
     - Calculate \(ST\) using the midsegment formula:
       \[
       ST = \frac{AB + CD}{2} = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9
       \]
   - The calculation confirms \(ST = 9\), which is consistent with the given information.

8. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated length of \(AB\) is 7, which matches choice C.

9. **Finalize the Answer:**
   - The correct choice is C.
</think>

**Solution:**

Using the midsegment theorem for trapezoids, we set up the equation \(9 = \frac{(x + 4) + (3x + 2)}{2}\). Solving this equation gives \(x = 3\). Substituting back, we find \(AB = 7\). This matches choice C.

Final Answer: C
