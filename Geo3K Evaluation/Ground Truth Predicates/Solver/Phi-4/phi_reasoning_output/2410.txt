**Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints**
- We have several geometric constraints:
  - Point \( B \) lies on line \( \overline{EA} \).
  - Point \( C \) lies on line \( \overline{AD} \).
  - Line \( \overline{BC} \) is parallel to line \( \overline{ED} \).

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**
- We need to find the length of \( \overline{CD} \) given the equations \( AC = x - 3 \), \( BE = 20 \), \( AB = 16 \), and \( CD = x + 5 \).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**
- Since \( \overline{BC} \parallel \overline{ED} \), and \( B \) is on \( \overline{EA} \), and \( C \) is on \( \overline{AD} \), triangles \( \triangle ABC \) and \( \triangle AED \) are similar by the Basic Proportionality Theorem (also known as Thales' theorem).

**Step 4: Set Up Proportions from Similar Triangles**
- From the similarity of triangles \( \triangle ABC \sim \triangle AED \), we can write the proportion:
  \[
  \frac{AB}{AE} = \frac{AC}{AD} = \frac{BC}{ED}
  \]

**Step 5: Express Known Lengths in Terms of \( x \)**
- We know:
  - \( AC = x - 3 \)
  - \( CD = x + 5 \)
  - \( AB = 16 \)
  - \( BE = 20 \)

- Since \( B \) is on \( \overline{EA} \), \( AE = AB + BE = 16 + 20 = 36 \).

**Step 6: Use Proportions to Find \( AD \)**
- From the proportion \( \frac{AB}{AE} = \frac{AC}{AD} \), we have:
  \[
  \frac{16}{36} = \frac{x - 3}{AD}
  \]

- Solving for \( AD \):
  \[
  AD = \frac{36(x - 3)}{16} = \frac{9(x - 3)}{4}
  \]

**Step 7: Express \( AD \) in Terms of \( CD \)**
- Since \( C \) is on \( \overline{AD} \), we have:
  \[
  AD = AC + CD = (x - 3) + (x + 5) = 2x + 2
  \]

- Equating the two expressions for \( AD \):
  \[
  \frac{9(x - 3)}{4} = 2x + 2
  \]

**Step 8: Solve the Equation for \( x \)**
- Clear the fraction by multiplying through by 4:
  \[
  9(x - 3) = 8x + 8
  \]

- Simplify and solve for \( x \):
  \[
  9x - 27 = 8x + 8
  \]
  \[
  9x - 8x = 8 + 27
  \]
  \[
  x = 35
  \]

**Step 9: Calculate \( CD \)**
- Substitute \( x = 35 \) into \( CD = x + 5 \):
  \[
  CD = 35 + 5 = 40
  \]

**Step 10: Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated value of \( CD \) is 40, which matches option D.

**Solution:**

By analyzing the given geometric constraints and applying the properties of similar triangles, we set up the necessary proportions and solved for \( x \). Substituting back, we found that \( CD = 40 \). This matches option D.
