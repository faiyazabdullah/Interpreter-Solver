**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- We are given a parallelogram JKLM.
- We know that \(\angle LKJ = 109^\circ\).
- The length of line segment ML is 6, but this specific length doesn't directly impact angle calculations in a parallelogram.

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**

- We need to find \(m \angle JML\).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**

- In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. Thus, \(\angle JKL = \angle LKM = 109^\circ\).
- Adjacent angles in a parallelogram are supplementary. Therefore, \(\angle KLM + \angle LKM = 180^\circ\).
- Using the supplementary angle property: \(\angle KLM = 180^\circ - 109^\circ = 71^\circ\).
- Since JKLM is a parallelogram, \(\angle JML\) is also equal to \(\angle KLM\) because opposite angles in a parallelogram are equal.

**Step 4: Verify Calculations and Logical Steps**

- We calculated \(\angle KLM = 71^\circ\).
- Since \(\angle JML\) is equal to \(\angle KLM\), \(m \angle JML = 71^\circ\).

**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated angle \(m \angle JML = 71^\circ\).
- Compare this with the answer choices: A. 50, B. 71, C. 109, D. 144.
- The closest and exact match is B. 71.

**Step 6: Finalize the Answer**

- Based on the calculations and comparisons, the correct answer is B. 71.

**Solution:**

Given the properties of a parallelogram and the supplementary nature of adjacent angles, we calculated \(m \angle JML\) to be 71 degrees. This matches one of the provided answer choices.
