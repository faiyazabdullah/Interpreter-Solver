1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a parallelogram with vertices labeled A, B, C, and D.
   - We are given the length of line segment \( AD = 12 \).
   - We are given the measure of angle \( \angle DCB = 60^\circ \).
   - We are given the length of line segment \( DC = 10 \).

2. **Identifying What Needs to Be Found:**
   - The problem asks for the perimeter of the parallelogram.

3. **Properties of a Parallelogram:**
   - Opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal in length.
   - Therefore, \( AB = DC = 10 \) and \( BC = AD = 12 \).

4. **Calculating the Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a parallelogram is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (AB + BC)
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (10 + 12) = 2 \times 22 = 44
     \]

5. **Verification:**
   - Reassess the calculations: \( 2 \times 22 = 44 \) is correct.
   - Check if any other properties or constraints were overlooked: The given angle \( \angle DCB = 60^\circ \) does not affect the side lengths directly in calculating the perimeter.

6. **Comparison with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated perimeter is 44.
   - Compare this with the provided answer choices: A. 22, B. 40, C. 44, D. 48.
   - The closest and exact match is choice C.

7. **Final Decision:**
   - Based on the calculations and verification, the correct answer is C. 44.

**Solution:**
The perimeter of the parallelogram is calculated as follows:
- Since opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal, we have \( AB = DC = 10 \) and \( BC = AD = 12 \).
- The perimeter \( P \) is given by:
  \[
  P = 2 \times (AB + BC) = 2 \times (10 + 12) = 2 \times 22 = 44
  \]
- The calculated perimeter matches choice C.

Final Answer: C
