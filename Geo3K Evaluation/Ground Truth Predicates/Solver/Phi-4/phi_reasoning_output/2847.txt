**Step 1: Analyze the given geometric constraints.**
- We know \( \angle HJK = 116^\circ \).
- \( K \) lies on line \( JE \).
- \( J \) lies on line \( HB \).
- Both \( K \) and \( J \) lie on circle \( C \) with radius \( 6.0 \).

**Step 2: Summarize relevant findings.**
- Since both \( J \) and \( K \) lie on circle \( C \), segment \( JK \) is a chord of the circle.
- \( \angle HJK \) is an angle formed by two lines, one of which passes through the center of the circle (since \( J \) and \( K \) are on the circle).

**Step 3: Identify what needs to be found.**
- We need to find \( m \widehat{JKL} \), which is the measure of the arc \( JKL \) on circle \( C \).

**Step 4: Apply relevant geometric theorems and properties.**
- The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.
- \( \angle HJK \) is an inscribed angle intercepting arc \( HJK \).
- Therefore, the measure of arc \( HJK \) is \( 2 \times 116^\circ = 232^\circ \).

**Step 5: Determine the measure of arc \( JKL \).**
- Since \( J \) and \( K \) are on the circle and \( K \) lies on line \( JE \), \( \angle JKL \) is the external angle for arc \( JKL \).
- The full circle is \( 360^\circ \).
- Arc \( JKL \) is the remaining part of the circle after arc \( HJK \).
- Therefore, \( m \widehat{JKL} = 360^\circ - 232^\circ = 128^\circ \).

**Step 6: Compare with answer choices.**
- The calculated measure \( 128^\circ \) does not match any answer choice directly.
- We need to find the closest match among the given choices: 116, 184, 232, 298.
- The closest to \( 128^\circ \) is \( 116^\circ \).

**Step 7: Verify and refine.**
- Reassess the calculation: \( m \widehat{JKL} = 360^\circ - 232^\circ = 128^\circ \).
- The closest answer choice to \( 128^\circ \) is indeed \( 116^\circ \).

**Step 8: Revisit previous steps.**
- Ensure all geometric properties and calculations are correctly applied.
- Confirm that \( \angle HJK \) is correctly interpreted as an inscribed angle.

**Step 9: Finalize the solution.**
- Based on the analysis and calculations, the closest answer choice to \( 128^\circ \) is \( 116^\circ \).

**Solution:**

Given the constraints and calculations, the measure of arc \( JKL \) is \( 128^\circ \), and the closest answer choice is \( 116^\circ \).
