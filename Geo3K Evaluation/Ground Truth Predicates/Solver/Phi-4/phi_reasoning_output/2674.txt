**Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints**

- We have several points \(A, B, C, D, E, F\) lying on a circle centered at \(F\). This means \(FA = FB = FC = FD = FE\) are all radii of the circle.
- We know \(\angle AFD = 50^\circ\).
- \(CF \perp FB\) implies \(\angle BFC = 90^\circ\).

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**

- We need to find the measure of the arc \(\widehat{ACE}\), which is the angle subtended by the arc \(ACE\) at the center \(F\).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**

- Since \(A, B, C, D, E\) lie on the circle, \(\angle AFD\) is the central angle subtending arc \(AD\).
- The measure of arc \(AD\) is equal to the measure of \(\angle AFD\), which is \(50^\circ\).

**Step 4: Determine the Measure of Arc \(CE\)**

- Since \(CF \perp FB\), \(\angle BFC = 90^\circ\).
- The circle is divided into arcs by points \(A, B, C, D, E\).
- We need to find the measure of arc \(ACE\), which is the sum of arcs \(AC\) and \(CE\).

**Step 5: Calculate the Measure of Arc \(ACE\)**

- Since \(CF \perp FB\), the points \(B\) and \(C\) are endpoints of a diameter, making arc \(BC\) a semicircle, \(180^\circ\).
- Arc \(AD = 50^\circ\), so arc \(DB = 180^\circ - 50^\circ = 130^\circ\).
- Since \(B\) and \(C\) are endpoints of a diameter, arc \(BC = 180^\circ\).
- Therefore, arc \(CD = 180^\circ - 130^\circ = 50^\circ\).
- Arc \(DE\) is the remaining part of the circle after arcs \(AD\), \(DB\), and \(CD\).
- Total circle = \(360^\circ\), so arc \(DE = 360^\circ - (50^\circ + 130^\circ + 50^\circ) = 130^\circ\).
- Arc \(CE = CD + DE = 50^\circ + 130^\circ = 180^\circ\).

**Step 6: Calculate Arc \(AC\)**

- Arc \(AB\) is the remaining part of the semicircle \(BC\) after arc \(BA\).
- Since \(FA = FB\), arc \(AB\) is symmetric with arc \(BA\).
- Arc \(BA = 90^\circ\) (since \(CF \perp FB\) and \(FB\) is a radius).
- Therefore, arc \(AB = 90^\circ\).
- Arc \(AC = AB + BC = 90^\circ + 90^\circ = 180^\circ\).

**Step 7: Calculate Arc \(ACE\)**

- Arc \(ACE = AC + CE = 180^\circ + 180^\circ = 360^\circ\).
- Since \(ACE\) is the entire circle, we need to subtract the arcs \(DA\) and \(EB\) (both are \(50^\circ\) and \(130^\circ\) respectively) to find the actual arc \(ACE\).
- Arc \(ACE = 360^\circ - 50^\circ - 130^\circ = 180^\circ\).

**Step 8: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated measure of arc \(ACE\) is \(180^\circ\).
- The closest answer choice to \(180^\circ\) is \(150^\circ\).

**Step 9: Select the Closest Answer**

- The closest answer choice to \(180^\circ\) is \(150^\circ\).

**Solution**

Based on the analysis and calculations, the measure of arc \(\widehat{ACE}\) is closest to \(150^\circ\). Therefore, the correct answer is:
