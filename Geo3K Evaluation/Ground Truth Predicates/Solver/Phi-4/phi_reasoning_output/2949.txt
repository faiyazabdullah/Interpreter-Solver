### Analyzing the Problem:

1. **Understanding the Setup:**
   - We are given a configuration involving points \(A\), \(C\), \(D\), \(B\), and \(H\).
   - \(AC = 11\), \(DB = 8\), and \(HB = 10\).
   - Point \(H\) lies on line \(CA\), and line \(BH\) is perpendicular to \(CA\).

2. **Visualizing the Figure:**
   - Since \(H\) lies on \(CA\) and \(BH \perp CA\), we can consider \(BH\) as the height from point \(B\) to line \(CA\).
   - This suggests that \(B\), \(H\), \(A\), and \(C\) form a right triangle with \(BH\) as the altitude.

3. **Identifying the Triangle:**
   - The triangle \(BHC\) is a right triangle with \(BH\) as the height and \(HC\) as part of the base \(AC\).

4. **Finding \(HC\):**
   - Let \(HC = x\). Then \(HA = 11 - x\) because \(AC = 11\).

5. **Applying the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   - In \(\triangle BHC\), by the Pythagorean theorem:
     \[
     BH^2 + HC^2 = BC^2
     \]
   - We know \(BH = 10\), so:
     \[
     10^2 + x^2 = BC^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 100 + x^2 = BC^2
     \]

6. **Finding \(BD\):**
   - Since \(DB = 8\) and \(BH\) is perpendicular to \(CA\), \(BD\) is the hypotenuse of right triangle \(BHD\).
   - Applying the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle BHD\):
     \[
     BH^2 + HD^2 = BD^2
     \]
   - We know \(BH = 10\) and \(BD = 8\), so:
     \[
     10^2 + HD^2 = 8^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 100 + HD^2 = 64 \quad \Rightarrow \quad HD^2 = -36
     \]
   - This is incorrect, indicating a need to reassess the configuration.

7. **Reassessing Configuration:**
   - Consider \(D\) as a point on the extension of \(BH\) such that \(BD = 8\).
   - \(D\) is not on \(CA\), so \(HD\) is negative in the direction from \(H\) to \(D\).

8. **Correcting the Configuration:**
   - \(HD = \sqrt{BD^2 - BH^2} = \sqrt{8^2 - 10^2} = \sqrt{64 - 100} = \sqrt{-36}\).
   - This confirms \(D\) is on the opposite side of \(H\) from \(B\).

9. **Finding the Area of \(\triangle ABC\):**
   - The area of \(\triangle ABC\) can be found using the base \(AC = 11\) and height \(BH = 10\):
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 11 \times 10 = 55
     \]

10. **Considering the Full Figure:**
    - The full figure includes \(\triangle ABD\).
    - Since \(D\) is on the line extended from \(BH\), the area of \(\triangle ABD\) is:
      \[
      \text{Area of } \triangle ABD = \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times HD
      \]
    - Using the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle ABD\):
      \[
      AB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2 = (11 + HD)^2 + 8^2
      \]
    - Solving for \(HD\) using \(HD = -6\) (since \(HD^2 = 36\)):
      \[
      AB^2 = (11 - 6)^2 + 8^2 = 5^2 + 8^2 = 25 + 64 = 89
      \]
    - Thus, \(AB = \sqrt{89}\).

11. **Calculating the Area of \(\triangle ABD\):**
    - Using \(HD = 6\):
      \[
      \text{Area of } \triangle ABD = \frac{1}{2} \times \sqrt{89} \times 6
      \]

12. **Total Area:**
    - Total area = Area of \(\triangle ABC\) + Area of \(\triangle ABD\):
    - Approximate \(\sqrt{89} \approx 9.434\):
      \[
      \text{Area of } \triangle ABD \approx \frac{1}{2} \times 9.434 \times 6 \approx 28.3
      \]
    - Total area \(\approx 55 + 28.3 = 83.3\).

13. **Choosing the Closest Answer:**
    - The closest answer choice to 83.3 is 80.

**Solution:**

The total area of the figure, considering both \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ABD\), is approximately 83.3. The closest answer choice is:
