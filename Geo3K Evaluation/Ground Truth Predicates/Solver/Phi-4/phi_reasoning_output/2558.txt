**Thought Section:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given three line segments in an equilateral triangle \( \triangle QRS \).
   - The lengths of these segments are expressed in terms of \( x \):
     - \( QR = 4x \)
     - \( RS = 2x + 1 \)
     - \( SQ = 6x - 1 \)
   - Since \( \triangle QRS \) is equilateral, all sides are equal. Therefore:
     \[
     QR = RS = SQ
     \]

2. **Setting Up Equations:**
   - From \( QR = RS \):
     \[
     4x = 2x + 1
     \]
     Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     4x - 2x = 1 \implies 2x = 1 \implies x = 0.5
     \]

   - From \( QR = SQ \):
     \[
     4x = 6x - 1
     \]
     Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     4x - 6x = -1 \implies -2x = -1 \implies x = 0.5
     \]

   - From \( RS = SQ \):
     \[
     2x + 1 = 6x - 1
     \]
     Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 1 = 6x - 1 \implies 1 + 1 = 6x - 2x \implies 2 = 4x \implies x = 0.5
     \]

3. **Verification:**
   - All equations consistently give \( x = 0.5 \).
   - Substitute \( x = 0.5 \) back into the expressions for the side lengths to verify:
     - \( QR = 4x = 4(0.5) = 2 \)
     - \( RS = 2x + 1 = 2(0.5) + 1 = 2 \)
     - \( SQ = 6x - 1 = 6(0.5) - 1 = 2 \)
   - All sides are indeed equal, confirming \( \triangle QRS \) is equilateral.

4. **Finding \( RS \):**
   - We have already calculated \( RS = 2x + 1 \).
   - Substitute \( x = 0.5 \):
     \[
     RS = 2(0.5) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The calculated length of \( RS \) is 2, which matches one of the answer choices.

</think>

**Solution Section:**

- Based on the calculations and verification, the length of \( RS \) when \( \triangle QRS \) is equilateral is 2.
- Comparing this with the answer choices, the correct answer is \( D. 2 \).
