**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- We have two lines: Line(C, B) and Line(C, A).
- Points E and D lie on these lines respectively.
- Line(D, E) is parallel to Line(B, A).

**Step 2: Understand the Segment Relationships**

- \( C E = t - 2 \)
- \( E B = t + 1 \)
- \( C D = 2 \)
- \( C A = 10 \)

**Step 3: Determine the Total Length of Line(C, B)**

Since \( E \) lies on Line(C, B), we can express the total length \( C B \) as:
\[ C B = C E + E B = (t - 2) + (t + 1) = 2t - 1 \]

**Step 4: Use the Parallel Line Property**

Line(D, E) is parallel to Line(B, A). This implies that the segments are proportional due to the intercept theorem (also known as the basic proportionality theorem or Thales' theorem).

**Step 5: Set Up Proportional Relationships**

Since Line(D, E) is parallel to Line(B, A), we have:
\[
\frac{C D}{C A} = \frac{C E}{C B}
\]

Substitute the known values:
\[
\frac{2}{10} = \frac{C E}{2t - 1}
\]

Simplify the left side:
\[
\frac{1}{5} = \frac{C E}{2t - 1}
\]

**Step 6: Solve for \( C E \)**

Cross-multiply to solve for \( C E \):
\[
C E = \frac{1}{5} \times (2t - 1)
\]

Substitute \( C E = t - 2 \) into the equation:
\[
t - 2 = \frac{1}{5} \times (2t - 1)
\]

**Step 7: Solve the Equation**

Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction:
\[
5(t - 2) = 2t - 1
\]

Expand and simplify:
\[
5t - 10 = 2t - 1
\]

Rearrange to solve for \( t \):
\[
5t - 2t = 10 - 1
\]
\[
3t = 9
\]
\[
t = 3
\]

**Step 8: Find \( C E \)**

Substitute \( t = 3 \) back into \( C E = t - 2 \):
\[
C E = 3 - 2 = 1
\]

**Step 9: Verify and Compare**

The calculated \( C E = 1 \) matches one of the answer choices.

**Step 10: Select the Closest Answer**

The closest answer choice to \( C E = 1 \) is option A.

</think>

**Solution:**

1. Analyze the given geometric constraints and relationships.
2. Use the property of parallel lines to set up a proportion.
3. Solve the proportion to find \( t \).
4. Substitute \( t \) back to find \( C E \).
5. Verify the calculation and compare with answer choices.

The calculated value of \( C E \) is 1, which matches option A.
