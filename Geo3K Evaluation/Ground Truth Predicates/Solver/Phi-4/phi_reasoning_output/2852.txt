**Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints**

- **LengthOf(Line(A, D)) = 4.1**: This directly gives the length of segment AD as 4.1 units.
- **PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(E, C))**: Point A lies on line EC.
- **PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(E, F))**: Point C lies on line EF.
- **PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(E, F))**: Point A lies on line EF.
- **PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(A, F))**: Point C lies on line AF.
- **PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(B, D))**: Point C lies on line BD.
- **LengthOf(Line(C, D)) = LengthOf(Line(C, B))**: CD equals CB.
- **Perpendicular(Line(C, A), Line(C, D))**: Line CA is perpendicular to line CD.

**Step 2: Understand the Question**

We need to find the length of segment AB.

**Step 3: Use Geometric Properties**

- Since CA is perpendicular to CD, triangle CAD is a right triangle with the right angle at C.
- We know AD = 4.1.
- CD = CB (given).

**Step 4: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**

In right triangle CAD:
\[ AD^2 = AC^2 + CD^2 \]

We need to find AB, but we don't have AC or CD directly. However, we can use the fact that C lies on BD and CD = CB to express everything in terms of known quantities.

**Step 5: Consider the Symmetry and Constraints**

Since CD = CB and C lies on BD, triangle BCD is isosceles with BC = CD. Let x be the length of CD (and CB).

**Step 6: Solve for x using the Pythagorean Theorem**

From triangle CAD:
\[ 4.1^2 = AC^2 + x^2 \]

**Step 7: Express AB in terms of x**

Since C lies on BD and CD = CB, and considering the perpendicularity:
- Triangle ABC is also a right triangle with the right angle at C.

Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ABC:
\[ AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 \]

Substitute \( BC = x \):
\[ AB^2 = AC^2 + x^2 \]

From the equation \( 4.1^2 = AC^2 + x^2 \), we have:
\[ AC^2 = 4.1^2 - x^2 \]

Substitute back:
\[ AB^2 = (4.1^2 - x^2) + x^2 \]
\[ AB^2 = 4.1^2 \]
\[ AB = 4.1 \]

**Step 8: Compare with Answer Choices**

The calculated length of AB is 4.1, which matches choice B.

</think>

**Solution:**

Given the constraints and the application of the Pythagorean theorem, we find that the length of segment AB is 4.1. This matches answer choice B.
