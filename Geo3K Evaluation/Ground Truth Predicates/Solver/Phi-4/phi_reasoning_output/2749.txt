1. **Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints:**
   - We have two lines: Line(W, Y) and Line(Z, X).
   - Point P lies on both lines.
   - Line(W, X) is perpendicular to Line(W, Z).

2. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length of segment Z X.
   - We are given expressions for Z P and P Y: \( ZP = 4x - 9 \) and \( PY = 2x + 5 \).

3. **Use Geometric Properties:**
   - Since P lies on Line(W, Y) and Line(Z, X), and Line(W, X) is perpendicular to Line(W, Z), this implies that P is the intersection point of the two lines.
   - The perpendicularity implies a right angle between Line(W, X) and Line(W, Z).

4. **Explore Relationships:**
   - Since P is on both lines, it divides them into segments: ZP and PX on Line(Z, X), and WP and PY on Line(W, Y).
   - The perpendicularity suggests that we can use the Pythagorean theorem if necessary.

5. **Set Up Equations:**
   - We need to find Z X, which is the sum of ZP and PX.
   - We know \( ZP = 4x - 9 \) and \( PY = 2x + 5 \).
   - Since P is the intersection point, and considering the perpendicularity, we can assume that the segments form right triangles.

6. **Calculate PX:**
   - Since Line(W, X) is perpendicular to Line(W, Z), and P is the intersection, PX can be related to PY through the right triangle formed by W, P, and X.
   - Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle WPX:
     \[
     WX^2 = WP^2 + PX^2
     \]
   - Similarly, in triangle WPZ:
     \[
     WZ^2 = WP^2 + ZP^2
     \]
   - Since WX is perpendicular to WZ, WX = WZ.

7. **Express PX in Terms of x:**
   - From the Pythagorean theorem:
     \[
     WP^2 + PX^2 = WP^2 + ZP^2
     \]
   - Therefore, \( PX^2 = ZP^2 \).
   - Thus, \( PX = ZP \).

8. **Find Z X:**
   - Since \( PX = ZP \), we have:
     \[
     ZX = ZP + PX = 2 \times ZP = 2(4x - 9) = 8x - 18
     \]

9. **Relate PY and ZP:**
   - Since P is on Line(W, Y), and using the right triangle properties:
     \[
     PY = 2x + 5
     \]
   - We can relate PY and ZP using the fact that they form a right triangle with WP:
     \[
     WP^2 + PY^2 = WP^2 + ZP^2
     \]
   - Therefore, \( PY^2 = ZP^2 \).
   - Thus, \( 2x + 5 = 4x - 9 \).

10. **Solve for x:**
    \[
    2x + 5 = 4x - 9
    \]
    \[
    5 + 9 = 4x - 2x
    \]
    \[
    14 = 2x
    \]
    \[
    x = 7
    \]

11. **Calculate Z X:**
    \[
    ZX = 8x - 18 = 8(7) - 18 = 56 - 18 = 38
    \]

12. **Verify and Compare:**
    - The calculated value of Z X is 38.
    - Compare with the given answer choices: A. 9, B. 10, C. 19, D. 38.
    - The closest and exact match is D. 38.

</think>
Solution:
- Based on the calculations and geometric reasoning, the length of Z X is 38.
- Comparing with the answer choices, the correct answer is D. 38.
