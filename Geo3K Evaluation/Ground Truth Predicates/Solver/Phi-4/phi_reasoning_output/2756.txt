**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- We have two similar triangles: \(\triangle WZX \sim \triangle SRT\).
- The lengths given are \(ST = 6\) and \(WX = 5\).
- The perimeter of \(\triangle SRT\) is 15.

**Step 2: Understand the Implications of Similarity**

- Since \(\triangle WZX \sim \triangle SRT\), the corresponding sides are proportional.
- Let the sides of \(\triangle SRT\) be \(SR = a\), \(RT = b\), and \(ST = 6\).
- The perimeter of \(\triangle SRT\) is \(a + b + 6 = 15\), so \(a + b = 9\).

**Step 3: Determine the Scale Factor**

- The corresponding side \(WX\) in \(\triangle WZX\) corresponds to \(ST\) in \(\triangle SRT\).
- The scale factor \(k\) from \(\triangle SRT\) to \(\triangle WZX\) is given by:
  \[
  k = \frac{WX}{ST} = \frac{5}{6}
  \]

**Step 4: Calculate the Perimeter of \(\triangle WZX\)**

- The perimeter of \(\triangle WZX\) is \(k\) times the perimeter of \(\triangle SRT\).
- Perimeter of \(\triangle SRT\) is 15.
- Therefore, the perimeter of \(\triangle WZX\) is:
  \[
  \text{Perimeter of } \triangle WZX = k \times 15 = \frac{5}{6} \times 15 = \frac{75}{6} = 12.5
  \]

**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated perimeter of \(\triangle WZX\) is 12.5.
- Among the answer choices, 12.5 is exactly option A.

**Solution:**

The perimeter of \(\triangle WZX\) is calculated using the scale factor derived from the similarity of the triangles. The scale factor is \(\frac{5}{6}\), and applying this to the perimeter of \(\triangle SRT\) gives us the perimeter of \(\triangle WZX\) as 12.5. Therefore, the correct answer is:
