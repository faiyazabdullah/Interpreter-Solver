**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**
- We have three angles at point B: \(\angle ABD = x\), \(\angle DBC = 132^\circ\), and \(\angle CBA = 65^\circ\).
- Points A, C, and D all lie on a circle centered at B with the same radius. This implies that triangle ABC and triangle ABD are inscribed in the same circle.

**Step 2: Use the Property of Angles Around a Point**
- The sum of angles around point B must be \(360^\circ\).
- Therefore, we have: 
  \[
  \angle ABD + \angle DBC + \angle CBA = 360^\circ
  \]
  Substituting the known values, we get:
  \[
  x + 132^\circ + 65^\circ = 360^\circ
  \]

**Step 3: Solve for x**
- Simplify the equation:
  \[
  x + 197^\circ = 360^\circ
  \]
- Subtract \(197^\circ\) from both sides:
  \[
  x = 360^\circ - 197^\circ = 163^\circ
  \]

**Step 4: Verify and Reflect**
- The calculated value of \(x\) is \(163^\circ\).
- Check if this value is consistent with the given geometric constraints and properties.
- Since all points lie on a circle centered at B, and the angles around B sum to \(360^\circ\), the calculation is consistent.

**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated value \(163^\circ\) matches option C.

**Step 6: Conclusion**
- The solution is consistent with the geometric constraints and the sum of angles around point B.
- Therefore, the correct answer choice is C.

**Solution:**
The value of \(x\) is calculated to be \(163^\circ\) by using the property that the sum of angles around point B is \(360^\circ\). The calculations are consistent with the given constraints and properties of the circle. Therefore, the correct answer is:
