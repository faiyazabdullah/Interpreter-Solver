1. **Analyze the Question and Constraints:**
   - We are given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with several points and lines defined with specific geometric properties.
   - \( G \) is the incenter of \( \triangle ABC \). The incenter is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect and is equidistant from all sides of the triangle.
   - We are given \( \text{LengthOf}(C, G) = 13 \) and \( \text{LengthOf}(B, C) = 12 \).
   - There are several perpendiculars involving \( G \) and other lines, indicating \( G \) is related to the angle bisectors of \( \triangle ABC \).

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find \( EG \), the distance from \( E \) to \( G \).
   - \( E \) lies on line \( BA \).

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems:**
   - Since \( G \) is the incenter, it is equidistant from the sides of the triangle. This means \( G \) is the center of the incircle of \( \triangle ABC \).
   - The perpendiculars from \( G \) to the sides of the triangle are the radii of the incircle.

4. **Consider the Given Perpendiculars:**
   - \( \text{Perpendicular}(G, D) \) to \( DC \) implies \( GD \) is the radius of the incircle.
   - \( \text{Perpendicular}(G, F) \) to \( FC \) implies \( GF \) is the radius of the incircle.
   - \( \text{Perpendicular}(G, E) \) to \( EA \) implies \( GE \) is the radius of the incircle.

5. **Use the Given Lengths:**
   - \( GC = 13 \) is given, which is a distance from \( G \) to a point \( C \) on the triangle.
   - \( BC = 12 \) is given, which is a side of the triangle.

6. **Reassess the Information:**
   - Since \( G \) is the incenter, the distances \( GD \), \( GF \), and \( GE \) are all equal to the inradius \( r \).
   - We need to find \( GE \), which is the inradius \( r \).

7. **Reflect on Possible Calculations:**
   - The inradius \( r \) can be found using the formula \( r = \frac{A}{s} \), where \( A \) is the area of the triangle and \( s \) is the semi-perimeter.
   - However, we don't have enough information to directly calculate \( A \) or \( s \) without additional side lengths or angles.

8. **Iterate on Known Values:**
   - Given \( GC = 13 \) and \( BC = 12 \), and knowing \( G \) is the incenter, we can infer that \( G \) is closer to \( C \) than to \( B \) or \( A \) due to the perpendiculars.
   - The perpendicular distances from \( G \) to the sides are equal, and \( GE \) is one of these distances.

9. **Choose the Closest Answer:**
   - Given the constraints and typical values for inradii in similar problems, we can estimate \( GE \) based on the given choices.
   - The options are \( 4, 5, 12, 13 \). Since \( GC = 13 \) and \( G \) is the incenter, \( GE \) should be less than \( GC \) and likely a smaller value.
   - The most reasonable estimate for the inradius given the constraints is \( 5 \).

</think>
**Solution:**

Given the constraints and the properties of the incenter, the distance \( EG \) is the inradius of \( \triangle ABC \). Based on the typical geometric properties and the given answer choices, the most reasonable estimate for the inradius \( GE \) is \( 5 \).
