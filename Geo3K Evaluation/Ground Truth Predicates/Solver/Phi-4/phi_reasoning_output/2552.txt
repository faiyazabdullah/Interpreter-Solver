**Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints**
- We have the following angles:
  - \(\angle EAD = 60^\circ\)
  - \(\angle DEA = 40^\circ\)
  - \(\angle BEC = 80^\circ\)
  - \(\angle EBA = 70^\circ\)
  - \(\angle ECB = 60^\circ\)
- Additionally, point \(E\) lies on the line segment \(DC\).

**Step 2: Identify the Objective**
- We need to determine which segments are parallel based on the given angles and the fact that \(E\) lies on \(DC\).

**Step 3: Apply Geometric Theorems and Properties**
- Consider the sum of angles around point \(E\):
  \[
  \angle EAD + \angle DEA + \angle EBA + \angle BEC + \angle ECB = 60^\circ + 40^\circ + 70^\circ + 80^\circ + 60^\circ = 310^\circ
  \]
  The sum is not \(360^\circ\), indicating that these angles do not form a complete circle around \(E\). This suggests that some angles are exterior to others.

- Since \(E\) lies on line \(DC\), \(\angle DEC\) and \(\angle CEB\) are supplementary:
  \[
  \angle DEC + \angle CEB = 180^\circ
  \]

**Step 4: Explore Parallelism Using Angle Relationships**
- Consider \(\angle EAD = 60^\circ\) and \(\angle ECB = 60^\circ\). If these angles are corresponding angles formed by a transversal intersecting two lines, then the lines \(AD\) and \(CB\) could be parallel.

- Check for alternate interior angles:
  - \(\angle DEA = 40^\circ\) and \(\angle BEC = 80^\circ\) do not form alternate interior angles with any transversal that could make lines parallel.

- Check for supplementary angles:
  - \(\angle EBA = 70^\circ\) and \(\angle BEC = 80^\circ\) are not supplementary with any angle on a transversal that could make lines parallel.

**Step 5: Reassess and Reflect on Findings**
- The most promising pair for parallelism is \(AD\) and \(CB\) due to the corresponding angles \(\angle EAD\) and \(\angle ECB\) both being \(60^\circ\).

**Step 6: Verify and Conclude**
- Given the analysis, the segments \(AD\) and \(CB\) are parallel based on the corresponding angles criterion.

**Solution:**
Based on the analysis of the given angles and the geometric constraints, the segments \(AD\) and \(CB\) are parallel due to the corresponding angles \(\angle EAD = 60^\circ\) and \(\angle ECB = 60^\circ\). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B. \(AD\) and \(BC\)
