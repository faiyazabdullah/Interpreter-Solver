1. **Analyzing the Given Information:**
   - We have a line segment \( BC \) with length 34.
   - We have another line segment \( AD \) with length \( x \).
   - Point \( D \) lies on line \( CB \).
   - Line \( AD \) is perpendicular to line \( DC \).

2. **Understanding the Geometric Configuration:**
   - Since \( D \) lies on line \( CB \) and \( AD \) is perpendicular to \( DC \), triangle \( ACD \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ADC = 90^\circ \).

3. **Identifying What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the length \( x \) of \( AD \).

4. **Using the Area of Triangle \( ACD \):**
   - The area of triangle \( ACD \) is given as 357 square inches.
   - The formula for the area of a right triangle is \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \).
   - Here, \( CD \) is the base, \( AD \) is the height, and the area is 357.

5. **Expressing the Area in Terms of Known Quantities:**
   - Let \( CD = y \). Then \( DB = 34 - y \) because \( D \) lies on \( CB \).
   - The area of triangle \( ACD \) is \( \frac{1}{2} \times y \times x = 357 \).

6. **Solving for \( x \):**
   - Rearrange the area equation: \( y \times x = 714 \) (since \( 357 \times 2 = 714 \)).
   - We need to express \( y \) in terms of \( x \) or vice versa to solve for \( x \).

7. **Using the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   - In right triangle \( ACD \), \( AC^2 = AD^2 + CD^2 \).
   - Let \( AC = z \). Then \( z^2 = x^2 + y^2 \).

8. **Finding \( y \) in Terms of \( x \):**
   - From \( y \times x = 714 \), we have \( y = \frac{714}{x} \).

9. **Substituting \( y \) in the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   - \( z^2 = x^2 + \left(\frac{714}{x}\right)^2 \).

10. **Simplifying and Solving:**
    - We don't need \( z \) explicitly, but we can solve for \( x \) by considering the constraints.
    - Substitute \( y = \frac{714}{x} \) back into the area equation:
      \[
      \frac{714}{x} \times x = 714
      \]
    - This confirms the relationship is consistent.

11. **Finding \( x \) by Estimation:**
    - Since \( y = \frac{714}{x} \) and \( y + (34 - y) = 34 \), we need \( y \) to be a feasible length.
    - Test values for \( x \) to find a suitable \( y \) that fits within the segment \( BC \).

12. **Testing Values:**
    - If \( x = 21 \), then \( y = \frac{714}{21} = 34 \), which is not possible since \( y \) cannot exceed 34.
    - If \( x = 22 \), then \( y = \frac{714}{22} \approx 32.45 \), which is feasible.
    - If \( x = 23 \), then \( y = \frac{714}{23} \approx 31.04 \), which is also feasible.
    - If \( x = 24 \), then \( y = \frac{714}{24} = 29.75 \), which is feasible.

13. **Choosing the Closest Valid \( x \):**
    - The value \( x = 22 \) gives a \( y \) that fits well within the segment \( BC \) and satisfies the area condition.
    - Check if \( x = 22 \) satisfies all conditions:
      - \( y = 32.45 \), \( DB = 34 - 32.45 = 1.55 \), both are positive and feasible.

14. **Conclusion:**
    - The closest and most feasible value for \( x \) that satisfies all conditions is \( x = 22 \).
</think>
Solution:
Based on the analysis and calculations, the length \( x \) of \( AD \) that satisfies all given conditions is 22. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B. 22
