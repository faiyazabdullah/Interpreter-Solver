**Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Constraints and Question**
- We have a square inscribed in a circle with a radius of 6 inches. 
- The problem requires finding the length of the side of this square.
- We know that for a square inscribed in a circle, the diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle.

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**
- The radius of the circle is given as 6 inches. Therefore, the diameter of the circle is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) inches.
- The diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle, hence the diagonal of the square is 12 inches.

**Step 3: Apply Geometric Properties**
- For a square with side length \(s\), the diagonal \(d\) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: 
  \[
  d = s\sqrt{2}
  \]
- Given that the diagonal \(d\) of the square is 12 inches, we can set up the equation:
  \[
  s\sqrt{2} = 12
  \]

**Step 4: Solve for the Side Length \(s\)**
- Rearrange the equation to solve for \(s\):
  \[
  s = \frac{12}{\sqrt{2}}
  \]
- Rationalize the denominator:
  \[
  s = \frac{12}{\sqrt{2}} \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{12\sqrt{2}}{2} = 6\sqrt{2}
  \]

**Step 5: Compare Calculated Result with Answer Choices**
- The calculated side length of the square is \(6\sqrt{2}\).
- Compare this with the answer choices:
  - A. \(\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}\)
  - B. \(3\sqrt{2}\)
  - C. \(6\sqrt{2}\)
  - D. \(12\sqrt{2}\)

**Step 6: Select the Correct Answer**
- The calculated side length \(6\sqrt{2}\) matches answer choice C.

**Step 7: Final Verification**
- Reassess the calculations and logic to ensure accuracy:
  - The diagonal of the square is correctly equated to the diameter of the circle.
  - The application of the Pythagorean theorem is correct.
  - The rationalization of the denominator was performed correctly.
- All steps align with geometric principles and calculations.
