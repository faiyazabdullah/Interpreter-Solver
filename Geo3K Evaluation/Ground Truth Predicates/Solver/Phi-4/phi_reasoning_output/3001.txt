1. **Understanding the Given Information:**
   - We have an angle \( \angle KCJ = 30^\circ \).
   - The length of line segment \( KC = 2 \).
   - Points \( K \) and \( J \) both lie on a circle centered at \( C \) with radius \( 3.0 \).

2. **Identify the Goal:**
   - We need to find the length of the arc \( \widehat{JK} \) on the circle, and round to the nearest hundredth.

3. **Determine the Circle's Properties:**
   - The circle has a radius of \( 3.0 \), so any point on the circle from \( C \) will be \( 3.0 \) units away.
   - Both \( K \) and \( J \) are on the circle, and \( \angle KCJ = 30^\circ \).

4. **Calculate the Arc Length Formula:**
   - The formula for the arc length \( s \) is given by:
     \[
     s = r \theta
     \]
     where \( r \) is the radius and \( \theta \) is the central angle in radians.

5. **Convert the Angle to Radians:**
   - Convert \( 30^\circ \) to radians:
     \[
     \theta = 30^\circ \times \frac{\pi}{180^\circ} = \frac{\pi}{6} \text{ radians}
     \]

6. **Calculate the Arc Length:**
   - Using the radius \( r = 3.0 \) and \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{6} \):
     \[
     s = 3.0 \times \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{3\pi}{6} = \frac{\pi}{2}
     \]
   - Approximate \( \pi \) as \( 3.14159 \):
     \[
     s \approx \frac{3.14159}{2} \approx 1.570795
     \]

7. **Round to the Nearest Hundredth:**
   - \( 1.570795 \) rounds to \( 1.57 \).

8. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated arc length \( 1.57 \) matches option D.

"Solution section": 
The length of the arc \( \widehat{JK} \) is calculated by converting the given angle to radians and using the formula for arc length with the circle's radius. After performing the calculations and rounding to the nearest hundredth, we find the arc length to be \( 1.57 \). Comparing this with the provided answer choices, the closest match is option D. Therefore, the final answer is:

Final Answer: D.
