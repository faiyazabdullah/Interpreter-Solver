**Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints**

- We have a trapezoid \(QRST\) with \(QS\) and \(TR\) as the legs.
- \(QS = 12\), \(TR = 20\).
- \(\angle STQ = 120^\circ\).
- \(\angle QRS = 45^\circ\).
- Points \(A\) and \(B\) are midpoints of \(TQ\) and \(SR\) respectively.
- The goal is to find \(\angle S\) of the trapezoid \(QRST\).

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**

- Trapezoid \(QRST\) has one pair of parallel sides: \(QR\) and \(ST\).
- Angles \(\angle STQ = 120^\circ\) and \(\angle QRS = 45^\circ\) are given.
- Since \(A\) and \(B\) are midpoints, by the midpoint theorem, line \(AB\) is parallel to \(QR\) and \(ST\), and \(AB\) is half the length of \(QR\) and \(ST\).

**Step 3: Apply Geometric Theorems**

- In a trapezoid, the sum of the angles on the same side of a leg is \(180^\circ\).
- Therefore, \(\angle STQ + \angle S = 180^\circ\).
- Given \(\angle STQ = 120^\circ\), we can find \(\angle S\) as follows:
  \[
  \angle S = 180^\circ - 120^\circ = 60^\circ
  \]

**Step 4: Verify the Accuracy**

- Check the consistency with the trapezoid properties and given angles.
- The calculation of \(\angle S\) using the angle sum property on the same side of the leg is correct.

**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated \(\angle S = 60^\circ\).
- Among the answer choices, \(60^\circ\) corresponds to option B.

**Step 6: Finalize the Solution**

- Based on the calculations and verification, the correct answer is option B.

<Solution>

Given the trapezoid \(QRST\) with the specified angles and lengths, we applied the angle sum property for the angles on the same side of a leg in a trapezoid. This led to the calculation of \(\angle S = 60^\circ\). Comparing this with the provided answer choices, the closest match is option B.

Final Answer: B
