**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**
- Circle \( O \) has a radius of 13 inches.
- \( OB \) is perpendicular to chord \( CD \) which is 24 inches long.
- Points \( C \) and \( D \) lie on the circle, hence \( OC = OD = 13 \) inches (radius).
- We need to find \( OX \), where \( X \) is the intersection point of lines \( OB \) and \( CD \).

**Step 2: Identify Key Geometric Properties**
- Since \( OB \) is perpendicular to chord \( CD \), \( X \) is the midpoint of \( CD \).
- The perpendicular from the center of a circle to a chord bisects the chord.

**Step 3: Calculate the Length \( CX \) and \( XD \)**
- Since \( X \) is the midpoint of \( CD \), \( CX = XD = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \) inches.

**Step 4: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**
- In right triangle \( \triangle OXC \), where \( OC = 13 \), \( CX = 12 \), and \( OX \) is the perpendicular from \( O \) to \( CD \).
- By the Pythagorean theorem: 
  \[
  OC^2 = OX^2 + CX^2
  \]
  \[
  13^2 = OX^2 + 12^2
  \]
  \[
  169 = OX^2 + 144
  \]
  \[
  OX^2 = 169 - 144 = 25
  \]
  \[
  OX = \sqrt{25} = 5
  \]

**Step 5: Verify the Calculations**
- The calculations align with the geometric properties and constraints given.
- \( OX = 5 \) inches is consistent with the Pythagorean theorem applied to \( \triangle OXC \).

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated \( OX = 5 \) inches matches choice A.

**Solution:**

1. We identified that \( X \) is the midpoint of \( CD \) because \( OB \) is perpendicular to \( CD \).
2. Calculated \( CX = XD = 12 \) inches.
3. Applied the Pythagorean theorem to \( \triangle OXC \) to find \( OX \).
4. Solved \( OX^2 = 25 \) leading to \( OX = 5 \) inches.
5. Verified the calculations are correct and consistent with the problem constraints.
6. The calculated \( OX = 5 \) inches matches answer choice A.
