### Step 1: Analyze the given information
- We have a trapezoid \(GHJK\) with the following properties:
  - \(HJ = 16.5\) feet
  - \(HI = 8.7\) feet
  - Point \(I\) lies on line \(GK\)
  - Line \(HI\) is perpendicular to line \(GK\)
  - The area of trapezoid \(GHJK\) is 188.35 square feet.

### Step 2: Identify what needs to be found
- We need to find the length of \(GK\).

### Step 3: Apply relevant geometric formulas
- The area \(A\) of a trapezoid is given by the formula:
  \[
  A = \frac{1}{2} \times (b_1 + b_2) \times h
  \]
  where \(b_1\) and \(b_2\) are the lengths of the parallel sides, and \(h\) is the height.

### Step 4: Determine the parallel sides and height
- In trapezoid \(GHJK\), \(HJ\) is one of the parallel sides.
- Since \(HI\) is perpendicular to \(GK\) and \(I\) lies on \(GK\), \(HI\) is the height of the trapezoid.
- Therefore, \(h = HI = 8.7\) feet.
- Let \(GK = b_2\) and \(GH = b_1\).

### Step 5: Use the area formula to find \(GK\)
- Substitute the known values into the area formula:
  \[
  188.35 = \frac{1}{2} \times (GH + GK) \times 8.7
  \]
- Simplify and solve for \(GH + GK\):
  \[
  188.35 = 4.35 \times (GH + GK)
  \]
  \[
  GH + GK = \frac{188.35}{4.35}
  \]
  \[
  GH + GK \approx 43.3
  \]

### Step 6: Consider the configuration of the trapezoid
- Since \(HI\) is perpendicular to \(GK\), and \(H\) and \(J\) are on the same side of \(GK\), \(GH\) is parallel to \(JK\).
- Assume \(GH = JK\) for simplicity (isosceles trapezoid assumption), then:
  \[
  GH + JK = 16.5
  \]
  \[
  2 \times GH = 16.5 \implies GH = 8.25
  \]

### Step 7: Solve for \(GK\)
- Substitute \(GH = 8.25\) into the equation for \(GH + GK\):
  \[
  8.25 + GK = 43.3
  \]
  \[
  GK = 43.3 - 8.25
  \]
  \[
  GK = 35.05
  \]

### Step 8: Compare with answer choices
- The calculated \(GK\) is 35.05 feet, which does not match any answer choice exactly.
- Choose the closest answer choice to 35.05 feet.

### Step 9: Select the closest answer
- The closest answer choice to 35.05 is 26.8 feet.
