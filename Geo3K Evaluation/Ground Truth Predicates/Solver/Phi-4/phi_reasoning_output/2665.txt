<think>
1. **Understanding the Problem**: We are given geometric constraints involving two sets of points and asked to find the value of \( x \) such that the two sets of polygons are similar. The lengths of certain line segments and the measures of certain angles are provided.

2. **Identifying Known and Unknowns**:
   - Known lengths: \( GE = y + 4 \), \( GF = 15 \), \( EF = 12 \), \( BC = 20 \), \( AB = 2x \), \( AC = 12 \).
   - Known angles: \(\angle BAC = \angle EFG\), \(\angle ABC = \angle EFG\), \(\angle ACB = \angle EGF\).

3. **Recognizing Similarity**: Since the polygons are similar, corresponding sides are proportional and corresponding angles are equal. We have the angle equality conditions, which confirms similarity.

4. **Setting Up Proportions**:
   - The triangles \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle EFG\) are similar.
   - Corresponding sides: \(\frac{AB}{EF} = \frac{AC}{FG} = \frac{BC}{EG}\).

5. **Using the Proportions**:
   - \(\frac{2x}{12} = \frac{12}{15} = \frac{20}{y + 4}\).

6. **Solving the Proportions**:
   - From \(\frac{2x}{12} = \frac{12}{15}\), solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{12} = \frac{12}{15} \implies 2x \cdot 15 = 12 \cdot 12 \implies 30x = 144 \implies x = \frac{144}{30} = \frac{24}{5} = 4.8
     \]
   - From \(\frac{12}{15} = \frac{20}{y + 4}\), solve for \( y \):
     \[
     \frac{12}{15} = \frac{20}{y + 4} \implies 12(y + 4) = 15 \times 20 \implies 12y + 48 = 300 \implies 12y = 252 \implies y = 21
     \]

7. **Verification**:
   - Check the third proportion \(\frac{20}{y + 4} = \frac{20}{25} = \frac{4}{5}\).
   - Verify \(\frac{2x}{12} = \frac{4}{5}\):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{12} = \frac{4}{5} \implies 2x \cdot 5 = 12 \cdot 4 \implies 10x = 48 \implies x = \frac{48}{10} = 4.8
     \]
   - The calculations are consistent.

8. **Choosing the Closest Answer**:
   - The calculated \( x = 4.8 \).
   - Compare with answer choices: A. 8, B. 12, C. 15, D. 20.
   - The closest value to 4.8 is 8.

9. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the calculations and the requirement to choose the closest value, the answer is A. 8.

</think>

**Solution**:
After setting up the proportions based on the similarity of triangles \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle EFG\), we calculated \( x = 4.8 \). Comparing this with the given answer choices, the closest value is 8.
