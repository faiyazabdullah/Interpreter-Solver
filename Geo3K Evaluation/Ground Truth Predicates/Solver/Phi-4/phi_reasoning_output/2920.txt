**Step 1: Analyze the given information and understand the problem.**

- We are given a trapezoid \( QRUT \) with \( QR \parallel UT \). 
- \( V \) and \( S \) are midpoints of the legs \( QU \) and \( RT \) respectively.
- We know the lengths \( QR = 4 \) and \( UT = 16 \).
- We need to find the length of the segment \( VS \), which connects the midpoints of the non-parallel sides.

**Step 2: Identify relevant geometric properties and theorems.**

- The segment connecting the midpoints of the non-parallel sides (legs) of a trapezoid is called the midsegment of the trapezoid.
- The length of the midsegment in a trapezoid is the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides (bases).

**Step 3: Apply the midsegment theorem for trapezoids.**

- According to the midsegment theorem for trapezoids, the length of the midsegment \( VS \) is given by:
  \[
  VS = \frac{QR + UT}{2}
  \]

**Step 4: Substitute the given values into the formula.**

- Substitute \( QR = 4 \) and \( UT = 16 \) into the formula:
  \[
  VS = \frac{4 + 16}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
  \]

**Step 5: Compare the calculated result with the answer choices.**

- The calculated length of \( VS \) is 10.
- The answer choices provided are: A. 5, B. 9, C. 10, D. 12.
- The calculated value of 10 matches exactly with choice C.

**Step 6: Verify the calculations and reasoning.**

- The midsegment theorem was applied correctly, and all calculations were verified to be accurate.
- There were no additional constraints or conditions that could alter the outcome.

**Step 7: Select the correct answer choice.**

- The calculated value of \( VS \) is 10, which corresponds to choice C.

**Solution:**

1. We applied the midsegment theorem for trapezoids, which states that the midsegment \( VS \) is the average of the lengths of the parallel sides \( QR \) and \( UT \).
2. Using the given lengths \( QR = 4 \) and \( UT = 16 \), we calculated:
   \[
   VS = \frac{4 + 16}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]
3. The calculated length of \( VS \) is 10, which matches choice C.
