**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
We need to find the measure of angle 3 in rectangle ABCD, given that m∠2 = 40 degrees. We have several geometric constraints and information about point E and lines related to the rectangle.

**Step 2: Analyze Given Information**
- ABCD is a rectangle, so all interior angles are 90 degrees.
- m∠2 = 40 degrees.
- Point E lies on lines DA and CB.
- Line BD is perpendicular to line BA, meaning angle ∠ABD is 90 degrees.

**Step 3: Determine Relationships**
- Since ABCD is a rectangle, ∠A, ∠B, ∠C, and ∠D are all 90 degrees.
- Given that m∠2 = 40 degrees, and ∠EAB = ∠2, point E creates a smaller angle with line AB.
- ∠EAB = 40 degrees implies that ∠EAD = 50 degrees because ∠DAB = 90 degrees (since it's a rectangle).

**Step 4: Analyze Angle 3**
- ∠DAC = ∠3, and since ∠DAB = 90 degrees, we have:
  - ∠DAB = ∠EAD + ∠DAC = 90 degrees.
  - Therefore, ∠DAC = 90 degrees - ∠EAD = 90 degrees - 50 degrees = 40 degrees.

**Step 5: Verify Calculations**
- We calculated ∠DAC = 40 degrees based on the given m∠2 and the properties of the rectangle.
- This matches the geometric constraints and the properties of a rectangle.

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated measure of ∠3 is 40 degrees.
- Compare this with the answer choices: A. 10, B. 40, C. 50, D. 90.
- The closest match is B. 40.

**Step 7: Conclusion**
- Based on the calculations and verification, the measure of angle 3 is 40 degrees.

**Solution:**
Given that ABCD is a rectangle, and using the properties of angles and the given constraints, we determined that m∠3 = 40 degrees. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B.
