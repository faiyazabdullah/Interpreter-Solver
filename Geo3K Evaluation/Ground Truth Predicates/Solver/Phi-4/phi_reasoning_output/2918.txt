**Step 1: Understand the Given Information**

- We have two lines: \( \overline{HF} \) and \( \overline{HK} \).
- Points \( G \) and \( J \) lie on \( \overline{HF} \) and \( \overline{HK} \) respectively.
- We need to find \( x \) such that \( \overline{GJ} \parallel \overline{FK} \).

**Step 2: Analyze the Conditions for Parallelism**

- For \( \overline{GJ} \parallel \overline{FK} \), the corresponding segments on the transversal must be proportional. This is derived from the Basic Proportionality Theorem (also known as Thales' theorem).

**Step 3: Set Up the Proportionality Condition**

- Given:
  - \( GH = x + 3.5 \)
  - \( HJ = x - 8.5 \)
  - \( FH = 21 \)
  - \( HK = 7 \)

- We need to find \( x \) such that:
  \[
  \frac{GH}{FH} = \frac{HJ}{HK}
  \]

**Step 4: Substitute Known Values into the Proportion**

- Substitute the given lengths:
  \[
  \frac{x + 3.5}{21} = \frac{x - 8.5}{7}
  \]

**Step 5: Solve the Proportion**

- Cross-multiply to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  7(x + 3.5) = 21(x - 8.5)
  \]

- Expand both sides:
  \[
  7x + 24.5 = 21x - 178.5
  \]

- Rearrange to isolate \( x \):
  \[
  24.5 + 178.5 = 21x - 7x
  \]

- Simplify:
  \[
  203 = 14x
  \]

- Solve for \( x \):
  \[
  x = \frac{203}{14} = 14.5
  \]

**Step 6: Verify and Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated value of \( x \) is 14.5.
- Check the answer choices: A. 12, B. 12.5, C. 14.5, D. 17.5.
- The calculated value matches choice C.

**Step 7: Conclusion**

- The correct answer is \( x = 14.5 \), which corresponds to choice C.

**Solution**

The value of \( x \) that satisfies the condition \( \overline{GJ} \parallel \overline{FK} \) is found by setting up and solving the proportion based on the given segment lengths. After cross-multiplying and solving the equation, we find \( x = 14.5 \). This matches answer choice C.

Final Answer: C
