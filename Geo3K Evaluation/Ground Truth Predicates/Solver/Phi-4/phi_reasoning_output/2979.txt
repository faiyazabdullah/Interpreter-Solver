1. **Analyzing the Given Information:**
   - We have a line segment \( AC \) with a length of 3 units.
   - Point \( D \) lies on line segment \( AC \).
   - Line \( DC \) is perpendicular to line \( DB \).

2. **Understanding the Geometry:**
   - Given \( DC \perp DB \), triangle \( DBC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle DBC = 90^\circ \).
   - We need to determine the area of a regular polygon. The regular polygon could be a triangle, square, or any other regular shape, but the context suggests a specific polygon based on the information provided.

3. **Exploring the Right Triangle \( DBC \):**
   - Since \( D \) lies on \( AC \) and \( DC \perp DB \), \( D \) is the foot of the perpendicular from \( C \) to line \( AB \).
   - The length \( AC = 3 \) suggests that \( D \) divides \( AC \) into two segments, \( AD \) and \( DC \).

4. **Considering the Regular Polygon:**
   - The perpendicularity condition and the length of \( AC \) suggest a geometric configuration that could form a regular polygon.
   - A common regular polygon involving perpendicularity and specific lengths is an equilateral triangle.

5. **Calculating the Area of an Equilateral Triangle:**
   - If \( \triangle ABC \) is equilateral with side length 3, the area \( A \) of an equilateral triangle is given by:
     \[
     A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2
     \]
     where \( s \) is the side length.
   - Substituting \( s = 3 \):
     \[
     A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 3^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 9 = \frac{9\sqrt{3}}{4}
     \]
   - Approximating \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \):
     \[
     A \approx \frac{9 \times 1.732}{4} = \frac{15.588}{4} \approx 3.897
     \]
   - Rounding to the nearest tenth gives \( 3.9 \).

6. **Verification and Conclusion:**
   - The calculated area of the equilateral triangle \( ABC \) is approximately \( 3.9 \).
   - Comparing with the answer choices, the closest match is \( 3.9 \).
