**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We are given three points \(V\), \(W\), and \(X\) with the lengths of lines \(VX = 75\), \(WV = 72\), and \(WX = 21\).
- The line segments \(WV\) and \(WX\) are perpendicular to each other.
- We need to find \(\cos X\) where \(X\) is the angle at point \(X\) in \(\triangle VWX\).

**Step 2: Analyze the Geometric Configuration**
- Since \(WV \perp WX\), \(\triangle VWX\) is a right triangle with the right angle at \(W\).
- We can apply the Pythagorean theorem to check the consistency of the given lengths:
  \[
  VW^2 + WX^2 = VX^2
  \]
  \[
  72^2 + 21^2 = 75^2
  \]
  \[
  5184 + 441 = 5625
  \]
  \[
  5625 = 5625
  \]
  The lengths satisfy the Pythagorean theorem, confirming that \(\triangle VWX\) is a right triangle.

**Step 3: Identify the Relevant Trigonometric Ratio**
- In \(\triangle VWX\), \(\cos X\) is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse at angle \(X\).
- The adjacent side to \(\angle X\) is \(WX = 21\), and the hypotenuse is \(VX = 75\).

**Step 4: Calculate \(\cos X\)**
- Using the definition of cosine in a right triangle:
  \[
  \cos X = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{WX}{VX} = \frac{21}{75}
  \]
- Simplify the fraction:
  \[
  \cos X = \frac{21}{75} = \frac{7}{25}
  \]

**Step 5: Convert to Decimal**
- Calculate \(\frac{7}{25}\) as a decimal:
  \[
  \frac{7}{25} = 0.28
  \]

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated value of \(\cos X\) is \(0.28\).
- Compare this with the given answer choices:
  - A. 0.28
  - B. 0.29
  - C. 0.96
  - D. 3.43
- The closest match is option A, which is \(0.28\).

**Step 7: Final Verification**
- Reassess all calculations and logical steps to ensure no errors.
- Confirm that the interpretation of the problem and application of the Pythagorean theorem were correct.
- Ensure that the trigonometric ratio was applied correctly.

**Solution:**

Given the calculations and analysis, the value of \(\cos X\) is \(0.28\). This matches option A.
