**Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints**

- We are given several geometric constraints involving points and lines.
- The key angles provided are:
  - \( \angle CBA = 90^\circ \)
  - \( \angle IAG = 157^\circ \)
  - \( \angle HCE = \angle 1 \)
- Additional information includes:
  - \( C \) lies on line \( BH \)
  - \( A \) lies on line \( BI \) and line \( DG \)
  - \( C \) lies on line \( EF \)
  - Line \( FE \) is parallel to line \( DG \)

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**

- We need to determine the measure of \( \angle 1 \).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**

- Since \( \angle CBA = 90^\circ \), \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle.
- \( A \) lies on line \( DG \), and line \( FE \) is parallel to line \( DG \).
- By the properties of parallel lines, alternate interior angles are equal. Therefore, \( \angle IAG \) and the angle formed by line \( DG \) and line \( BI \) are equal.
- Given \( \angle IAG = 157^\circ \), the corresponding angle on line \( DG \) is also \( 157^\circ \).

**Step 4: Calculate \( \angle 1 \)**

- Since \( \angle HCE = \angle 1 \) and \( C \) lies on line \( BH \), we need to consider the relationship between these lines and angles.
- \( \angle HCE \) is an exterior angle for \( \triangle ACH \) where \( \angle CBA = 90^\circ \) and \( \angle IAG = 157^\circ \).
- The sum of angles around point \( A \) is \( 360^\circ \).
- The angle adjacent to \( \angle IAG \) on line \( BI \) is \( 180^\circ - 157^\circ = 23^\circ \).
- Since \( \angle CBA = 90^\circ \), the remaining angle at \( A \) in \( \triangle ACH \) is \( 180^\circ - 90^\circ - 23^\circ = 67^\circ \).
- Therefore, \( \angle HCE = 180^\circ - 67^\circ = 113^\circ \).

**Step 5: Compare Calculated Result with Answer Choices**

- The calculated measure of \( \angle 1 \) is \( 113^\circ \).
- Among the answer choices, \( 113^\circ \) corresponds to option B.

**Step 6: Finalize the Answer**

- The closest and correct answer choice is B.
