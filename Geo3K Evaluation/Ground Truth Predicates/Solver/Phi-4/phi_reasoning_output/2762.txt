1. **Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints:**
   - We have two triangles, \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle FDG\), and it is given that they are similar (\(\triangle ABC \sim \triangle FDG\)).
   - Similar triangles have corresponding angles equal and corresponding sides in proportion.

2. **Identify Known Lengths and Relationships:**
   - Lengths provided:
     - \(DF = 12\)
     - \(FQ = 8\)
     - \(AB = 15\)
   - We need to find \(AP = x\).

3. **Understand the Implications of Similarity:**
   - Since \(\triangle ABC \sim \triangle FDG\), the corresponding sides are proportional. This means:
     \[
     \frac{AB}{FD} = \frac{AC}{FG} = \frac{BC}{DG}
     \]

4. **Determine Corresponding Points:**
   - \(A\) corresponds to \(F\), \(B\) corresponds to \(D\), and \(C\) corresponds to \(G\).
   - From the given angles:
     - \(\angle CAP = \angle BAP\) implies that \(P\) is on the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\).
     - \(\angle GFQ = \angle DFQ\) implies that \(Q\) is on the angle bisector of \(\angle FDG\).

5. **Use the Angle Bisector Theorem:**
   - The Angle Bisector Theorem states that the ratio of the two segments created by the angle bisector on one side of the triangle is equal to the ratio of the other two sides.
   - For \(\triangle ABC\), since \(P\) lies on the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\), we have:
     \[
     \frac{BP}{PC} = \frac{AB}{AC}
     \]
   - For \(\triangle FDG\), since \(Q\) lies on the angle bisector of \(\angle FDG\), we have:
     \[
     \frac{DQ}{QG} = \frac{DF}{FG}
     \]

6. **Calculate Proportional Relationships:**
   - From the similarity \(\triangle ABC \sim \triangle FDG\), we have:
     \[
     \frac{AB}{FD} = \frac{15}{12} = \frac{5}{4}
     \]
   - Therefore, the corresponding side \(AC\) in \(\triangle ABC\) is proportional to \(FG\) in \(\triangle FDG\) by the same ratio:
     \[
     \frac{AC}{FG} = \frac{5}{4}
     \]

7. **Find \(AP\) Using Proportions:**
   - Since \(P\) is on the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\), and using the Angle Bisector Theorem:
     \[
     \frac{AP}{PC} = \frac{AB}{BC}
     \]
   - However, we need to find \(AP\) directly using the similarity ratio:
     - Since \(AP\) corresponds to \(FQ\) in the similar triangles, we have:
     \[
     \frac{AP}{FQ} = \frac{AB}{FD} = \frac{5}{4}
     \]
   - Given \(FQ = 8\), we solve for \(AP\):
     \[
     \frac{AP}{8} = \frac{5}{4} \implies AP = 8 \times \frac{5}{4} = 10
     \]

8. **Verify and Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated value of \(x = AP = 10\).
   - Compare with the given answer choices: A. 8, B. 10, C. 12, D. 15.
   - The closest and exact match is B. 10.

</think>

Solution: Based on the analysis and calculations, the value of \(x\) is 10. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

Final Answer: B
