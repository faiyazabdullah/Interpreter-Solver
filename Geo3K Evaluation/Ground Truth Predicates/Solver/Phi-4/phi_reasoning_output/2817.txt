**Analyzing the Question:**

1. **Geometric Constraints:**
   - \( AB = 15 \)
   - \( AC = 9 \)
   - \( BC = 12 \)
   - \( AC \perp BC \)

2. **Objective:**
   - Find the area of triangle \( \triangle ABC \).

3. **Understanding the Constraints:**
   - The fact that \( AC \) is perpendicular to \( BC \) suggests that \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \).

**Summarizing Findings:**

- Since \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( AC \) and \( BC \) as the legs, we can use the formula for the area of a right triangle: 
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
  \]
  Here, \( AC \) and \( BC \) are the base and height.

**Exploring Ideas:**

- Calculate the area using the given lengths:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 9 \times 12
  \]

**Verification and Calculation:**

- Perform the calculation:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 9 \times 12 = \frac{1}{2} \times 108 = 54
  \]

**Reassessing and Reflecting:**

- The calculated area is 54, which matches one of the answer choices.

**Backtracking and Iteration:**

- Double-check the steps:
  - The right triangle property was correctly identified.
  - The correct formula for the area of a right triangle was used.
  - The calculation was performed accurately.

**Conclusion:**

- The calculated area of the triangle is 54, which corresponds to choice C.

**Solution:**

Given the right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with \( AC \) and \( BC \) as the perpendicular sides, the area is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times BC = \frac{1}{2} \times 9 \times 12 = \frac{1}{2} \times 108 = 54
\]

The calculated area is 54, which matches answer choice C.
