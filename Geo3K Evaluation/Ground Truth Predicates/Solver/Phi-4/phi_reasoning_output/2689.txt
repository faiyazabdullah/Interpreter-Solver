<think>
1. **Analyzing the given geometric constraints**:  
   - We have several lengths given:  
     - \( \text{Length of } \overline{BG} = 2 \)  
     - \( \text{Length of } \overline{DC} = 5 \)  
     - \( \text{Length of } \overline{AB} = 2 \)  
     - \( \text{Length of } \overline{HE} = 5 \)  
     - \( \text{Length of } \overline{CE} = 5 \)  
     - \( \text{Length of } \overline{GF} = 2 \)  
   - Points lying on lines:  
     - \( F \) lies on line \( \overline{AD} \)  
     - \( A \) lies on line \( \overline{DH} \)  
     - \( F \) lies on line \( \overline{DH} \)  
     - \( A \) lies on line \( \overline{HF} \)  

2. **Summarizing relevant findings**:  
   - The points \( A, B, C, D, E, F, \) and \( G, H \) seem to form a closed figure.  
   - Points \( A, D, H, F \) lie on the same line, suggesting a straight path.  
   - Points \( A, B, G, F \) and \( D, C, E \) may form segments of the figure.

3. **Exploring the structure**:  
   - Based on the constraints, we can try to visualize the figure as a polygon.  
   - \( A, B, G, F \) are connected by the lines \( \overline{AB}, \overline{BG}, \overline{GF} \).  
   - \( D, C, E \) are connected by the lines \( \overline{DC}, \overline{CE} \).  
   - \( H, E \) are connected by \( \overline{HE} \).  
   - \( F \) and \( A \) are connected by line \( \overline{AF} \) (since \( F \) lies on \( \overline{AD} \) and \( A \) lies on \( \overline{HF} \)).

4. **Reassessing and verifying**:  
   - The perimeter of the figure is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.  
   - We need to ensure all segments are accounted for and correctly identified.

5. **Calculating the perimeter**:  
   - The segments we have are:  
     - \( \overline{AB} = 2 \)  
     - \( \overline{BG} = 2 \)  
     - \( \overline{GF} = 2 \)  
     - \( \overline{DC} = 5 \)  
     - \( \overline{CE} = 5 \)  
     - \( \overline{HE} = 5 \)  
   - We need to determine if any segments are repeated or if any additional segments are needed.  
   - Since \( A \) lies on \( \overline{HF} \) and \( F \) lies on \( \overline{AD} \), \( \overline{AF} \) is part of the perimeter.  
   - \( \overline{AF} \) can be deduced as the remaining segment to close the figure, and since \( F \) lies on \( \overline{AD} \), \( \overline{AF} \) is part of the line \( \overline{AD} \).

6. **Refining calculations**:  
   - The figure seems to be a hexagon with segments \( \overline{AB}, \overline{BG}, \overline{GF}, \overline{FD}, \overline{DC}, \overline{CE}, \overline{EH}, \overline{HA} \).  
   - We already have:  
     - \( \overline{AB} = 2 \)  
     - \( \overline{BG} = 2 \)  
     - \( \overline{GF} = 2 \)  
     - \( \overline{DC} = 5 \)  
     - \( \overline{CE} = 5 \)  
     - \( \overline{HE} = 5 \)  
   - We need to find \( \overline{FD} \) and \( \overline{HA} \).  
   - Since \( F \) lies on \( \overline{AD} \) and \( A \) lies on \( \overline{HF} \), \( \overline{FD} \) and \( \overline{HA} \) are parts of the line segments \( \overline{AD} \) and \( \overline{HF} \).  
   - Given \( \overline{HE} = 5 \) and \( \overline{CE} = 5 \), \( \overline{HC} \) is not a separate segment, so \( \overline{HA} \) must be the remaining part of \( \overline{HF} \) after \( \overline{FA} \).  
   - Since \( \overline{GF} = 2 \) and \( F \) lies on \( \overline{AD} \), \( \overline{FD} \) is the remaining part of \( \overline{AD} \) after \( \overline{AF} \).

7. **Final calculation**:  
   - The perimeter is:  
     \[
     \overline{AB} + \overline{BG} + \overline{GF} + \overline{FD} + \overline{DC} + \overline{CE} + \overline{EH} + \overline{HA} = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 2 = 25
     \]

8. **Reflection and comparison**:  
   - The calculated perimeter is 25, which matches one of the given answer choices.
