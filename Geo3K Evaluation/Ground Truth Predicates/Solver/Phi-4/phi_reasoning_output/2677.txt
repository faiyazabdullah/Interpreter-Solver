1. **Analyzing the Question and Constraints:**
   - We are given a polygon with specific equal lengths between points: 
     - \( \text{Length of } \overline{DB} = \text{Length of } \overline{AC} \)
     - \( \text{Length of } \overline{AC} = \text{Length of } \overline{CE} \)
     - \( \text{Length of } \overline{CE} = \text{Length of } \overline{BE} \)
     - \( \text{Length of } \overline{BE} = \text{Length of } \overline{AD} \)

2. **Summarizing the Constraints:**
   - From the given constraints, all the segments \( \overline{DB}, \overline{AC}, \overline{CE}, \overline{BE}, \) and \( \overline{AD} \) are equal in length. Let's denote this common length as \( x \).

3. **Identifying the Shape and Sides:**
   - We have five segments that are equal, indicating a polygon with five sides (a pentagon), where each side is of length \( x \).

4. **Determining the Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter of the polygon is given as 60 centimeters. 
   - Since all five sides of the pentagon are equal, the perimeter \( P \) can be expressed as:
     \[
     P = 5x
     \]
   - We know \( P = 60 \), so:
     \[
     5x = 60
     \]

5. **Solving for \( x \):**
   - Solve the equation \( 5x = 60 \) for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{60}{5} = 12
     \]

6. **Verification:**
   - Verify that \( x = 12 \) satisfies the condition for the perimeter:
     \[
     5 \times 12 = 60
     \]
   - This confirms that our calculation is correct.

7. **Choosing the Correct Answer:**
   - The calculated side length \( x \) is 12 centimeters.
   - Compare this with the answer choices: A. 12, B. 15, C. 30, D. 60.
   - The closest and exact match is 12.

8. **Reflection and Conclusion:**
   - The solution is consistent with the problem's constraints and calculations. The logical steps confirm that the length of each side of the polygon is indeed 12 cm.

Solution:
Based on the geometric constraints and calculations, the length of each side of the polygon is 12 centimeters. Therefore, the correct answer choice is A.
