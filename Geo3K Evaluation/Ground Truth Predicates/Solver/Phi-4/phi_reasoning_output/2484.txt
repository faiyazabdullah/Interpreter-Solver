### Thought Section

1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have three points A, B, and C forming two line segments: AB and BC with lengths 42 and 38, respectively.
   - The line segment AC has an unknown length denoted by \( x \).
   - The lines CA and CB are perpendicular to each other.

2. **Identify the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length of line segment AC using the given information, particularly leveraging the fact that CA is perpendicular to CB.

3. **Apply Geometric Theorems:**
   - Since CA is perpendicular to CB, triangle ABC is a right triangle with AC as one leg, BC as the other leg, and AB as the hypotenuse.
   - We can apply the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

4. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - According to the Pythagorean theorem:
     \[
     AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2
     \]
   - Substitute the given lengths into the equation:
     \[
     42^2 = x^2 + 38^2
     \]

5. **Calculate:**
   - Compute \( 42^2 \) and \( 38^2 \):
     \[
     42^2 = 1764
     \]
     \[
     38^2 = 1444
     \]
   - Substitute these values into the equation:
     \[
     1764 = x^2 + 1444
     \]
   - Solve for \( x^2 \):
     \[
     x^2 = 1764 - 1444 = 320
     \]
   - Find \( x \) by taking the square root:
     \[
     x = \sqrt{320}
     \]

6. **Simplify the Expression:**
   - Simplify \( \sqrt{320} \):
     \[
     \sqrt{320} = \sqrt{64 \times 5} = \sqrt{64} \times \sqrt{5} = 8\sqrt{5}
     \]

7. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated value \( x = 8\sqrt{5} \) matches one of the provided answer choices.

8. **Select the Correct Answer:**
   - The closest match to \( 8\sqrt{5} \) is option C.

**Solution Section**

- Based on the Pythagorean theorem and the given geometric constraints, we found that the length of AC is \( 8\sqrt{5} \).
- Comparing this with the answer choices, we find that the correct answer is:
