1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a circle with center \( D \) and radius \( r \).
   - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) lie on this circle.
   - \( A \) and \( B \) are endpoints of a diameter, meaning \( AB = 2r \).
   - \( AC = 8 \) inches and \( BC = 15 \) inches.
   - We need to find the radius \( r \).

2. **Analyzing the Geometry:**
   - Since \( A \) and \( B \) are endpoints of a diameter, \( D \) is the midpoint of \( AB \).
   - \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) form a triangle inscribed in the circle.
   - By the properties of a circle, the angle \( \angle ACB \) is a right angle (Thales' theorem).

3. **Applying the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   - In right triangle \( \triangle ACB \), with \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \):
     \[
     AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     (2r)^2 = 8^2 + 15^2
     \]
   - Calculate:
     \[
     4r^2 = 64 + 225
     \]
     \[
     4r^2 = 289
     \]
     \[
     r^2 = \frac{289}{4}
     \]
     \[
     r = \sqrt{\frac{289}{4}}
     \]
     \[
     r = \frac{\sqrt{289}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     r = \frac{17}{2}
     \]
     \[
     r = 8.5
     \]

4. **Comparing with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated radius is \( 8.5 \).
   - The answer choices are:
     - A. 7.5
     - B. 8
     - C. 8.5
     - D. 17
   - The closest and exact match is choice C, which is 8.5.

</think>

**Solution:**

1. We identified that \( A \) and \( B \) are endpoints of a diameter, making \( AB = 2r \).
2. Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle ACB \), we found:
   \[
   (2r)^2 = 8^2 + 15^2 \Rightarrow 4r^2 = 289 \Rightarrow r^2 = \frac{289}{4} \Rightarrow r = \frac{17}{2} = 8.5
   \]
3. The calculated radius is 8.5 inches, which matches choice C.
