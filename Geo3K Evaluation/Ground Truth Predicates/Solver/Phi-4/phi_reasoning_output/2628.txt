1. **Analyzing the Given Constraints:**
   - We have several points lying on certain lines and circles.
   - Notably, points \(G, H, J, K, F\) lie on a circle with center \(M\) and radius \(2.0\).
   - The lines \(\overline{LG}\) and \(\overline{LK}\) are perpendicular, as are \(\overline{NP}\) and \(\overline{NJ}\).
   - Distances \(FL = 24\) and \(HJ = 48\) are given. 
   - We need to find \(NJ\).

2. **Understanding the Circle:**
   - All points \(G, H, J, K, F\) are on the circle \(\odot M\) with radius \(2.0\). This implies that they are equidistant from the center \(M\).

3. **Exploring the Problem's Geometry:**
   - Since \(FL = 24\) and \(HJ = 48\), and these segments are chords of the circle, we can consider their geometric properties.
   - The perpendicularity condition suggests that \(L\) and \(N\) are points where lines through these points are tangent to the circle.

4. **Using the Perpendicularity and Chord Properties:**
   - For a chord in a circle, the perpendicular from the center bisects the chord.
   - Therefore, \(FL = 24\) implies \(FM = ML = 12\).
   - Similarly, \(HJ = 48\) implies \(HM = MJ = 24\).

5. **Using the Angle Information:**
   - \(m \widehat{HP} = 65^\circ\) suggests that the arc \(HP\) subtends this angle at the circle.
   - Since \(H\) and \(P\) are on the circle, and \(M\) is the center, \(\angle HMP = 65^\circ\).

6. **Finding \(NJ\):**
   - Since \(N\) lies on the line \(NJ\) which is perpendicular to \(NP\), and both \(N\) and \(P\) lie on the circle, \(N\) must be on the circle as well.
   - Given the symmetry and the properties of the circle, \(NJ\) must be a chord parallel to \(HJ\) or another chord with similar properties.
   - Since \(HJ = 48\) and the circle's symmetry, \(NJ\) should also be \(48\) due to the parallel nature and equal arc subtending.

7. **Reassessing the Choices:**
   - The closest and most logical choice for \(NJ\) based on the given information and symmetry is \(48\).

</think>

<Solution>
Given the geometric constraints and properties of the circle, the symmetry and perpendicularity conditions suggest that \(NJ\) is equal to \(HJ\), which is \(48\). Therefore, the correct answer is:
