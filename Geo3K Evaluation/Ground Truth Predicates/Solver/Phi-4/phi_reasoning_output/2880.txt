1. **Analyze the Given Constraints:**
   - We have a circle \(\odot P\) with center \(P\) and radius 2.0.
   - Points \(M, K, J, L, N\) all lie on this circle, indicating they are all equidistant from \(P\).
   - \(P\) is a point on the line segments \(MK\) and \(JL\), suggesting \(P\) is collinear with these points.
   - \(NP \perp PL\), indicating that \(N\) and \(L\) form a right angle with \(P\).

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find \(m \widehat{NJ}K\), the measure of the arc subtended by points \(N, J, K\) on the circle.

3. **Consider the Given Angle:**
   - \(m \angle MPL = 65^\circ\). Since \(M, P, L\) are collinear and \(P\) is the center, \(\angle MPL\) is a central angle.

4. **Determine the Relationship Between Points:**
   - Since \(NP \perp PL\), \(\angle NPL = 90^\circ\).
   - \(M, K, J, L, N\) are on the circle, forming a cyclic pentagon.

5. **Calculate the Arc Measures:**
   - The central angle \(\angle MPL = 65^\circ\) subtends arc \(ML\) of \(65^\circ\).
   - Since \(NP \perp PL\), \(\angle NPL = 90^\circ\), subtending arc \(NL\) of \(90^\circ\).

6. **Find Arc \(NJ\):**
   - Since \(NPL\) is a right angle, and \(PL\) is part of the line \(JL\), the arc \(NJ\) can be found by considering the circle's symmetry and the given angles.
   - Arc \(NJ\) is part of the semicircle formed by \(NPL\), minus the arc \(ML\).

7. **Calculate Arc \(JK\):**
   - Since \(J, K\) are on the line through \(P\), and \(JL\) is a line, \(JK\) is part of the line \(JL\).
   - The arc \(JK\) is directly opposite to \(ML\) on the circle.

8. **Determine Arc \(NJL\):**
   - Arc \(NJL\) is the sum of arcs \(NJ\) and \(JK\).
   - Since \(NPL\) is \(90^\circ\), and \(ML\) is \(65^\circ\), arc \(NL\) is \(90^\circ\).
   - Arc \(NJ\) is \(90^\circ - 65^\circ = 25^\circ\).

9. **Calculate Arc \(NJK\):**
   - Arc \(NJK\) is \(360^\circ - (ML + NL) = 360^\circ - (65^\circ + 90^\circ) = 205^\circ\).
   - Since \(JK\) is opposite \(ML\), arc \(JK\) is \(180^\circ - 65^\circ = 115^\circ\).
   - Therefore, arc \(NJ\) is \(205^\circ - 115^\circ = 90^\circ\).

10. **Verify and Compare:**
    - The measure of arc \(NJ\) is \(25^\circ\) from the calculation above.
    - The measure of arc \(JK\) is \(115^\circ\).
    - Therefore, \(m \widehat{NJ}K = 25^\circ\).

11. **Select the Closest Answer:**
    - The closest answer to \(25^\circ\) is choice A.

</think>

**Solution:**
Based on the analysis and calculations, the measure of arc \(\widehat{NJ}K\) is \(25^\circ\). Therefore, the correct answer is:
