**Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints**
- We have two quadrilaterals: \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\).
- The lengths of segments \(AB\) and \(EF\) are \(x\) and 4, respectively.
- The areas of quadrilaterals \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) are 32 and 8, respectively.
- The quadrilaterals are similar figures.

**Step 2: Understand the Problem Requirements**
- We need to find the value of \(x\) using the similarity of the quadrilaterals and the given areas.

**Step 3: Recall Properties of Similar Figures**
- For similar figures, the ratio of corresponding lengths is equal to the square root of the ratio of their areas.
- Let \(k\) be the similarity ratio. Then, \(k = \frac{\text{Length of } AB}{\text{Length of } EF} = \frac{x}{4}\).

**Step 4: Relate Areas Using Similarity Ratio**
- The ratio of the areas of similar figures is the square of the ratio of their corresponding lengths.
- Therefore, \(\frac{\text{Area of } ABCD}{\text{Area of } EFGH} = k^2\).
- Substitute the given areas: \(\frac{32}{8} = k^2\).

**Step 5: Solve for \(k\)**
- Simplify the area ratio: \(\frac{32}{8} = 4\).
- Thus, \(k^2 = 4\).
- Solving for \(k\), we get \(k = \sqrt{4} = 2\).

**Step 6: Solve for \(x\)**
- Recall \(k = \frac{x}{4}\).
- Substitute \(k = 2\): \(2 = \frac{x}{4}\).
- Solve for \(x\): \(x = 2 \times 4 = 8\).

**Step 7: Verify and Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated value of \(x\) is 8.
- Check the answer choices: A. 1, B. 2, C. 8, D. 16.
- The calculated value matches choice C.

**Step 8: Conclude**
- The calculations align with the properties of similar figures and the given constraints.
- The closest and correct choice is C.

**Solution:**
Given that the quadrilaterals are similar, we used the property that the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths. We calculated the similarity ratio \(k\) as 2 and found \(x\) to be 8. Therefore, the correct answer is:
