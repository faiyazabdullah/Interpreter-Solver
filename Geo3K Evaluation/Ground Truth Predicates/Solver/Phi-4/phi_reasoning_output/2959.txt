1. **Understanding the Given Constraints:**
   - We have a point \( E \) that lies on lines \( CD \) and \( AB \).
   - The lengths \( AE = 12 \), \( DE = 11 \), \( DE = CE \), and \( AE = BE \) are provided.
   - From the constraints, we have \( DE = CE = 11 \) and \( AE = BE = 12 \).

2. **Identifying the Geometric Shape:**
   - Given the equalities \( AE = BE \) and \( DE = CE \), and the fact that \( E \) lies on both lines \( CD \) and \( AB \), we can infer that \( ABCD \) forms a rhombus.
   - In a rhombus, all sides are equal, and diagonals bisect each other at right angles.

3. **Using the Properties of a Rhombus:**
   - The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.
   - Let \( AC \) and \( BD \) be the diagonals of the rhombus.
   - \( E \) is the intersection of diagonals \( AC \) and \( BD \).

4. **Calculating the Lengths of the Diagonals:**
   - Since \( AE = BE = 12 \), the full diagonal \( AC = AE + EC = 12 + 11 = 23 \).
   - Since \( DE = CE = 11 \), the full diagonal \( BD = DE + EB = 11 + 12 = 23 \).

5. **Calculating the Area of the Rhombus:**
   - The area \( A \) of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2
     \]
     where \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \) are the lengths of the diagonals.
   - Substituting the values, we get:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 23 \times 23 = \frac{1}{2} \times 529 = 264.5
     \]

6. **Selecting the Closest Answer:**
   - The calculated area is 264.5, which is closest to 264.

7. **Verification:**
   - Reassess the calculations: \( AC = 23 \), \( BD = 23 \), and the area calculation is consistent with the formula for the area of a rhombus.
   - The closest answer choice to 264.5 is 264.

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the diagonals:**
   - \( AC = 23 \) and \( BD = 23 \).

2. **Calculate the area using the formula for the area of a rhombus:**
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 23 \times 23 = \frac{1}{2} \times 529 = 264.5
   \]

3. **Select the closest answer:**
   - The closest answer to 264.5 is 264.
