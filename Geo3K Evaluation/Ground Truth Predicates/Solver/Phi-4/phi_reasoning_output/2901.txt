### Thought Section

1. **Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints:**
   - We have two triangles, \(\triangle WXY\) and \(\triangle WXZ\), which are congruent.
   - The measure of \(\angle YXW\) is given as \(20y + 10\).
   - The length of \(ZX\) is \(3y + 7\).
   - The length of \(YX\) is 19.
   - Point \(X\) lies on line \(ZY\).
   - Line \(XW\) is perpendicular to line \(XZ\).

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the value of \(y\) such that \(\triangle WXY \cong \triangle WXZ\).

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
   - Since \(\triangle WXY \cong \triangle WXZ\), corresponding sides and angles must be equal.
   - \(WX\) is a common side in both triangles.
   - \(\angle XWZ = \angle XWY = 90^\circ\) (since \(XW \perp XZ\)).
   - \(XY = XZ\) because corresponding sides in congruent triangles are equal.

4. **Set Up Equations Based on Congruence:**
   - From \(XY = XZ\), we have:
     \[
     19 = 3y + 7
     \]
   - Solve for \(y\):
     \[
     19 = 3y + 7 \\
     19 - 7 = 3y \\
     12 = 3y \\
     y = 4
     \]

5. **Verify the Congruence Condition:**
   - Check if the angle condition is satisfied:
     - \(\angle YXW = 20y + 10\).
     - Substitute \(y = 4\):
       \[
       \angle YXW = 20(4) + 10 = 80 + 10 = 90^\circ
       \]
   - This is consistent with \(\angle XWZ = 90^\circ\), confirming the congruence condition.

6. **Reassess and Reflect:**
   - All conditions for congruence are satisfied with \(y = 4\).
   - The calculations are consistent with the given constraints.

7. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated value \(y = 4\) matches option B.

8. **Finalize the Solution:**
   - The correct answer is \(y = 4\), which corresponds to choice B.

**Solution Section**

Based on the analysis and calculations, the value of \(y\) that satisfies all the given geometric constraints and ensures the congruence of \(\triangle WXY\) and \(\triangle WXZ\) is \(y = 4\). This value satisfies both the side length and angle conditions required for congruence.
