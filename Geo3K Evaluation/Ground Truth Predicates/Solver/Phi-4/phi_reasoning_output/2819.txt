1. **Analyzing the Given Information:**
   - We have two line segments: \( BC = 17 \) and \( DE = 8 \).
   - \( DE = AE \) implies that \( A \), \( D \), and \( E \) are collinear with \( E \) being the midpoint of \( AD \) since \( AE = DE = 8 \).
   - \( E \) lies on both line \( CB \) and line \( AD \).

2. **Understanding the Geometry:**
   - The problem suggests a rhombus, which is a quadrilateral with all sides equal and diagonals that bisect each other at right angles.
   - Since \( E \) is on both \( CB \) and \( AD \), \( E \) is the intersection point of the diagonals of the rhombus.

3. **Properties of a Rhombus:**
   - The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.
   - If \( DE = 8 \) and \( DE = AE \), then \( AD = 16 \) because \( E \) is the midpoint of \( AD \).
   - \( BC = 17 \) is one of the diagonals of the rhombus.

4. **Using the Diagonal Relationship:**
   - Let the diagonals be \( d_1 = 17 \) (since \( BC = 17 \)) and \( d_2 = AD = 16 \).
   - The area \( A \) of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula involving its diagonals:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2
     \]

5. **Calculating the Area:**
   - Substitute the values of the diagonals into the formula:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 17 \times 16 = \frac{1}{2} \times 272 = 136
     \]

6. **Verification:**
   - The calculation aligns with the properties of a rhombus and the given constraints.
   - The computed area is 136, which matches one of the provided answer choices.

7. **Selecting the Closest Answer:**
   - The calculated area is exactly 136, which corresponds to option B.

**Solution:**

The area of the rhombus is calculated using the formula for the area involving its diagonals:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 17 \times 16 = 136
\]

Thus, the area of the rhombus is 136. Comparing this with the given answer choices, the correct answer is:
