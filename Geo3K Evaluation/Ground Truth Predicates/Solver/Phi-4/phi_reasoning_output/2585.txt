**Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints**

- We are given a triangle with points \( R \), \( Q \), and \( P \).
- The lengths of the sides are:
  - \( RQ = 15 \)
  - \( QP = 17 \)
  - \( RP = 8 \)
- It is also given that \( \text{Line}(R, P) \) is perpendicular to \( \text{Line}(R, Q) \). This means \( \triangle RPQ \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( R \).

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**

- We need to express the ratio \( \sin P \) as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems**

- Since \( \triangle RPQ \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( R \), we can use trigonometric ratios.
- \( \sin P \) is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite angle \( P \) to the hypotenuse.
- In \( \triangle RPQ \), angle \( P \) is opposite side \( RQ \) and the hypotenuse is \( QP \).

**Step 4: Calculate \( \sin P \)**

- Using the definition of sine in a right triangle:
  \[
  \sin P = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{RQ}{QP} = \frac{15}{17}
  \]

**Step 5: Convert the Fraction to a Decimal**

- Calculate \( \frac{15}{17} \) using a calculator:
  \[
  \frac{15}{17} \approx 0.8823529411764706
  \]

- Round this decimal to the nearest hundredth:
  \[
  0.8823529411764706 \approx 0.88
  \]

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated value of \( \sin P \) is \( 0.88 \).
- Compare this with the given answer choices:
  - A. 0.47
  - B. 0.53
  - C. 0.88
  - D. 1.88

- The closest match is option C: 0.88.

**Step 7: Select the Closest Answer**

- Since the calculated value matches exactly with option C, we select C.

**Solution:**

Based on the analysis and calculations, the value of \( \sin P \) rounded to the nearest hundredth is \( 0.88 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:
