1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have an equilateral pentagon \(PQRST\) inscribed in a circle centered at \(U\) with a radius of 5.0.
   - We need to find the measure of \(\angle PSR\).

2. **Summarize Relevant Findings:**
   - An equilateral pentagon inscribed in a circle means all sides are equal, and all central angles subtended by the sides are equal.
   - The total angle around point \(U\) is \(360^\circ\).
   - Since the pentagon is equilateral, each central angle is \(\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ\).

3. **Explore Geometric Properties:**
   - The central angle subtended by arc \(PR\) is \(2 \times 72^\circ = 144^\circ\) because \(P\) and \(R\) are separated by one vertex \(Q\).
   - \(\angle PSR\) is an inscribed angle subtended by arc \(PR\).

4. **Apply Inscribed Angle Theorem:**
   - The inscribed angle is half of the central angle subtending the same arc.
   - Therefore, \(\angle PSR = \frac{144^\circ}{2} = 72^\circ\).

5. **Verify Calculations:**
   - Check if the steps align with geometric principles: central angle and inscribed angle relationship.
   - The calculation of \(\angle PSR\) as \(72^\circ\) is consistent with the properties of inscribed angles.

6. **Reassess and Reflect:**
   - Re-evaluate the steps to ensure no errors in logic or calculation.
   - The relationship between central and inscribed angles was correctly applied.

7. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated angle \(\angle PSR = 72^\circ\) matches option B.

8. **Select the Closest Answer:**
   - Since the calculated answer matches one of the choices, select it directly.

**Solution:**
- The measure of \(\angle PSR\) is calculated using the inscribed angle theorem, which states that an inscribed angle is half of the central angle subtending the same arc.
- The central angle subtended by arc \(PR\) is \(144^\circ\).
- Therefore, \(\angle PSR = \frac{144^\circ}{2} = 72^\circ\).
- The correct answer choice is \(72^\circ\).
