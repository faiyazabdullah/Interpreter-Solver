**Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Constraints**

We are given the following equations for the lengths of the sides of triangle \(\triangle XYZ\):

1. \( \text{LengthOf(Line(Y, X))} = 2x + 3 \)
2. \( \text{LengthOf(Line(X, Z))} = 8x - 4 \)
3. \( \text{LengthOf(Line(Y, Z))} = 4x - 1 \)
4. \( \text{LengthOf(Line(Y, Z))} = \text{LengthOf(Line(Y, X))} \)

**Step 2: Identify the Isosceles Triangle Condition**

From constraint 4, we know that \( \text{LengthOf(Line(Y, Z))} = \text{LengthOf(Line(Y, X))} \). This implies that \(\triangle XYZ\) is isosceles with \( YZ = YX \).

**Step 3: Set Up the Equation**

Since \( YZ = YX \), we equate the expressions for these lengths:

\[
4x - 1 = 2x + 3
\]

**Step 4: Solve for \( x \)**

Rearrange the equation:

\[
4x - 2x = 3 + 1
\]

\[
2x = 4
\]

\[
x = 2
\]

**Step 5: Verify the Solution**

Substitute \( x = 2 \) back into the expressions for the side lengths to verify the isosceles condition:

- \( YX = 2x + 3 = 2(2) + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7 \)
- \( YZ = 4x - 1 = 4(2) - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7 \)

Since \( YX = YZ = 7 \), the isosceles condition is satisfied.

**Step 6: Check the Third Side**

Calculate \( XZ \) to ensure the triangle inequality holds:

- \( XZ = 8x - 4 = 8(2) - 4 = 16 - 4 = 12 \)

Check the triangle inequalities:

1. \( YX + YZ > XZ \) : \( 7 + 7 > 12 \) which is \( 14 > 12 \) (True)
2. \( YX + XZ > YZ \) : \( 7 + 12 > 7 \) which is \( 19 > 7 \) (True)
3. \( YZ + XZ > YX \) : \( 7 + 12 > 7 \) which is \( 19 > 7 \) (True)

All inequalities are satisfied, confirming that a valid triangle is formed.

**Step 7: Select the Closest Answer**

The calculated value of \( x \) is 2, which matches answer choice A.

**Step 8: Final Verification**

Reassess all calculations and logical steps to ensure no errors were made. The solution is consistent with the problem constraints and the properties of an isosceles triangle.

**Solution:**

The value of \( x \) that satisfies the given geometric constraints and makes \(\triangle XYZ\) isosceles is \( x = 2 \). This corresponds to answer choice A.
