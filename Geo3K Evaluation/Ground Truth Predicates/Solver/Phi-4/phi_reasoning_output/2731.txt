1. **Analyze the Given Constraints:**
   - We have four points: A, B, C, and E. Additionally, there's a point D and lines DE and CE are involved.
   - \( \text{LengthOf(Line(D, E))} = 5 \)
   - \( \text{LengthOf(Line(A, C))} = 12 \)
   - \( \text{LengthOf(Line(C, B))} = 13 \)
   - Point E lies on Line CA, meaning E is somewhere between C and A.
   - Line DE is perpendicular to Line CE, forming a right triangle CDE.

2. **Identify the Problem:**
   - We need to find the perimeter of a parallelogram. However, the points and lines described donâ€™t directly define a parallelogram, suggesting that we need to deduce it from the given constraints.

3. **Use Geometric Properties and Theorems:**
   - Since DE is perpendicular to CE, triangle CDE is a right triangle with CE as one leg and DE as another.
   - Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle CDE:
     \[
     \text{CE}^2 + \text{DE}^2 = \text{CD}^2
     \]
     \[
     \text{CE}^2 + 5^2 = \text{CD}^2
     \]
   - We need to find CE to proceed, so let's express CE in terms of CA:
     - Since E lies on CA, \( \text{CE} + \text{EA} = \text{CA} = 12 \).

4. **Explore Possibilities:**
   - Assume CE = x, then EA = 12 - x.
   - Substitute into the Pythagorean theorem:
     \[
     x^2 + 25 = \text{CD}^2
     \]
   - We need more information about CD or another relationship to solve for x.

5. **Reassess the Problem:**
   - Consider the triangle ACB:
     - \( \text{AC} = 12 \), \( \text{CB} = 13 \).
     - Use the Pythagorean theorem to check if triangle ACB is a right triangle:
       \[
       \text{AB}^2 = \text{AC}^2 + \text{CB}^2 = 12^2 + 13^2 = 144 + 169 = 313
       \]
       \[
       \text{AB} = \sqrt{313}
       \]
   - Since AB is not an integer, ACB is not a right triangle.

6. **Reflect on the Parallelogram:**
   - Given the constraints, consider AC and CB as sides of a parallelogram.
   - The parallelogram could be ACDB, where AC and BD are parallel, and CB and AD are parallel.
   - The perimeter of parallelogram ACDB is:
     \[
     2(\text{AC} + \text{CB}) = 2(12 + 13) = 2 \times 25 = 50
     \]

7. **Verify and Compare:**
   - The calculated perimeter is 50, which matches one of the answer choices.
   - No further adjustments are necessary as all calculations align with the given constraints.

8. **Finalize the Answer:**
   - The closest and correct answer choice is B. 50.

</think>

Solution:
- Given the constraints and analysis, the perimeter of the parallelogram ACDB is calculated as \( 2 \times (12 + 13) = 50 \).
- The correct answer choice is B.

Final Answer: B
