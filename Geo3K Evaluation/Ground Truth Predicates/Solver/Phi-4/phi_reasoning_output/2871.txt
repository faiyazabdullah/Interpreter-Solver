**Step 1: Understand the Given Information**
- We have two lengths given: \( DC = 21 \) and \( AB = 32 \).
- The problem refers to a "kite," which is a quadrilateral with two distinct pairs of adjacent sides that are equal.

**Step 2: Identify the Kite Properties**
- In a kite, the diagonals intersect at right angles (90 degrees).
- The diagonals of a kite split each other into two pairs of congruent triangles.
- One diagonal bisects the other.

**Step 3: Relate Given Lengths to Kite Properties**
- Assume \( AC \) and \( BD \) are the diagonals of the kite.
- Given \( DC = 21 \) and \( AB = 32 \), we can infer these are parts of the diagonals.

**Step 4: Determine the Diagonals**
- Assume \( AC \) is the diagonal that is bisected by \( BD \).
- Therefore, \( D \) and \( C \) are endpoints of one half of diagonal \( AC \), making \( AC = 2 \times DC = 42 \).
- Similarly, \( A \) and \( B \) are endpoints of the other half of diagonal \( BD \), making \( BD = 2 \times AB = 64 \).

**Step 5: Calculate the Area of the Kite**
- The area \( A \) of a kite can be calculated using the formula:
  \[
  A = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2
  \]
  where \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \) are the lengths of the diagonals.
- Substitute \( d_1 = 42 \) and \( d_2 = 64 \):
  \[
  A = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 \times 64
  \]
  \[
  A = 21 \times 64
  \]
  \[
  A = 1344
  \]

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated area is 1344, which matches option D.

**Step 7: Verify and Conclude**
- Reassess the calculations and logic: The steps align with the properties of a kite and the formula for its area.
- The closest answer choice is D.

**Solution:**

1. Recognize that \( DC = 21 \) and \( AB = 32 \) are parts of the diagonals of the kite.
2. Calculate the full diagonals: \( AC = 2 \times 21 = 42 \) and \( BD = 2 \times 32 = 64 \).
3. Use the area formula for a kite: 
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 \times 64 = 21 \times 64 = 1344
   \]
4. The calculated area is 1344, which corresponds to option D.
