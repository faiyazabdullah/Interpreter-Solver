**Step 1: Analyzing the Given Information**
- We are given that quadrilateral \(EFGH\) is a rectangle.
- In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, and all angles are right angles.
- We know \(EF = 4x - 6\) and \(HG = x + 3\).
- Since \(EFGH\) is a rectangle, \(EF = HG\).

**Step 2: Setting Up the Equation**
- Given that \(EF = HG\), we can set up the equation:
  \[
  4x - 6 = x + 3
  \]

**Step 3: Solving the Equation**
- Rearrange the equation to solve for \(x\):
  \[
  4x - x = 3 + 6
  \]
  \[
  3x = 9
  \]
  \[
  x = 3
  \]

**Step 4: Calculating \(EF\)**
- Substitute \(x = 3\) back into the expression for \(EF\):
  \[
  EF = 4x - 6 = 4(3) - 6 = 12 - 6 = 6
  \]

**Step 5: Verifying the Calculation**
- Check the calculation by substituting \(x = 3\) into \(HG\):
  \[
  HG = x + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6
  \]
- Both \(EF\) and \(HG\) are equal, confirming the calculation is consistent with the properties of a rectangle.

**Step 6: Comparing with Answer Choices**
- The calculated value of \(EF\) is 6.
- Compare this with the answer choices: A. 6, B. 12, C. 18, D. 20.
- The calculated value matches choice A.

**Step 7: Finalizing the Answer**
- Based on the calculations and verification, the correct answer is choice A.

<Solution>
To solve the problem, we used the property of rectangles that opposite sides are equal. We set up the equation \(4x - 6 = x + 3\) based on \(EF = HG\). Solving this equation gave \(x = 3\). Substituting \(x = 3\) back into the expression for \(EF\) resulted in \(EF = 6\). This matches answer choice A. Therefore, the final answer is:

Final Answer: A
