<think>
1. **Analyze the given constraints and the question**: We are given a regular hexagon U, V, W, X, Y, Z where each side is 12 cm. We need to find the distance between points W and Y.

2. **Understand the geometry of a regular hexagon**: 
   - A regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles.
   - All sides of the hexagon are equal.
   - The distance between two non-adjacent vertices (such as W and Y) can be determined by considering the hexagon as being inscribed in a circle.

3. **Identify the geometric properties**:
   - In a regular hexagon, the distance between two vertices that are two sides apart (like W and Y) is equal to the length of the diagonal that spans two sides.
   - This diagonal is twice the length of a side of the hexagon.

4. **Apply relevant geometric theorems**:
   - Since each side of the hexagon is 12 cm, the diagonal spanning two sides (WY) can be calculated using the properties of equilateral triangles and the Pythagorean theorem.
   - Consider triangle UWY, which is an equilateral triangle with each side being 12 cm. The line segment WY is the diagonal of two such equilateral triangles.

5. **Calculate the length of WY**:
   - The diagonal of a regular hexagon that spans two sides (like WY) is equal to the side length multiplied by \(\sqrt{3}\).
   - Therefore, \(WY = 12 \times \sqrt{3}\).

6. **Compare with answer choices**:
   - The calculated length \(12 \sqrt{3}\) matches option C.

7. **Verify calculations**:
   - Reassess the geometry: The diagonal spanning two sides in a regular hexagon is indeed \(12 \sqrt{3}\), confirming the calculation.
   - Ensure no other geometric interpretations or constraints alter this result.

8. **Select the closest answer**:
   - The calculated result \(12 \sqrt{3}\) directly matches one of the provided answer choices.

</think>

<Solution>
Given the geometry of a regular hexagon and the properties of its diagonals, the distance between two vertices that are two sides apart (W and Y) is \(12 \sqrt{3}\) cm. This matches option C.

Final Answer: C. \(12 \sqrt{3}\)
