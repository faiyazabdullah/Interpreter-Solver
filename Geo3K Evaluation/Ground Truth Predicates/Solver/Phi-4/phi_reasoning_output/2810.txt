**Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Constraints**

- We are given several angles with specific measures, namely angles 1 through 8.
- The key given information is that Quadrilateral ABCD is a rectangle.
- We are provided with the measure of angle 1 (\( m \angle 1 = 38^\circ \)).
- We need to find the measure of angle 2 (\( m \angle 2 \)).

**Step 2: Understand Rectangle Properties**

- In a rectangle, opposite angles are equal, and all angles are \(90^\circ\).
- We need to focus on how the given angles relate to the rectangle and the points provided.

**Step 3: Analyze Given Points and Lines**

- Point G lies on lines DA and BC.
- Line BA is perpendicular to line BD.
- This implies that angles formed by these intersections are right angles.

**Step 4: Determine Relationships Between Angles**

- Since \( \angle 1 \) is given as \(38^\circ\) and it is \( \angle CAD \), we can infer some properties about the rectangle and the other angles.
- Since \( \angle 1 = \angle CAD = 38^\circ \), we can use the property of the rectangle that \( \angle ADC = 90^\circ \).

**Step 5: Calculate \( \angle 2 \)**

- \( \angle GAB \) is \( \angle 2 \).
- Since G lies on line DA and BC, and considering the perpendicularity condition, \( \angle GAB \) is complementary to \( \angle CAD \) because \( \angle GAB + \angle CAD = 90^\circ \) (since \( \angle DAB = 90^\circ \) in rectangle ABCD).
- Therefore, \( m \angle 2 = 90^\circ - m \angle 1 = 90^\circ - 38^\circ = 52^\circ \).

**Step 6: Verify and Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated measure of \( \angle 2 \) is \( 52^\circ \).
- Check the answer choices: A. 33, B. 38, C. 52, D. 87.
- The calculated value \( 52^\circ \) matches choice C.

**Step 7: Conclusion**

- Based on the analysis and calculations, the measure of \( \angle 2 \) is \( 52^\circ \).
- The closest and exact match to our calculated value is choice C.

<Solution>

Given the properties of the rectangle and the provided angle measures, we determined that \( m \angle 2 = 52^\circ \). This conclusion follows from the complementary relationship between \( \angle CAD \) and \( \angle GAB \) within the context of the rectangle's right angles. Thus, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: C. 52
