1. **Analyze the Geometric Constraints:**
   - We have a right triangle formed by points A, B, and C.
   - Line segment AC is perpendicular to line segment AB, indicating a right angle at A.
   - Length of AC is given as 5 units.
   - Length of AB is given as 12 units.

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the length of the hypotenuse of this right triangle, which is the segment opposite the right angle.

3. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   - The Pythagorean Theorem states that for a right triangle with legs \(a\) and \(b\), and hypotenuse \(c\), the relationship is \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\).
   - Here, AC and AB are the legs of the triangle, and BC is the hypotenuse.

4. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Let \(a = 5\) (AC), \(b = 12\) (AB), and \(c\) be the hypotenuse (BC).
   - Substitute into the Pythagorean Theorem: 
     \[
     5^2 + 12^2 = c^2
     \]

5. **Calculate:**
   - Calculate \(5^2\): 
     \[
     5^2 = 25
     \]
   - Calculate \(12^2\): 
     \[
     12^2 = 144
     \]
   - Add these results:
     \[
     25 + 144 = 169
     \]
   - Therefore, \(c^2 = 169\).

6. **Solve for \(c\):**
   - Take the square root of both sides to find \(c\):
     \[
     c = \sqrt{169} = 13
     \]

7. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated length of the hypotenuse is 13.
   - Check the answer choices:
     - A. 5
     - B. \(\sqrt{119}\)
     - C. 12
     - D. 13

8. **Select the Correct Answer:**
   - The correct answer is D. 13.

</think>

**Solution:**

Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we found that the length of the hypotenuse BC is 13. Comparing this with the given answer choices, the correct choice is D. 13.
