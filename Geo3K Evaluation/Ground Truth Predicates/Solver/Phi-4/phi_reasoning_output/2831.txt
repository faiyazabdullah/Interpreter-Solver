<think>
1. **Analyze the given geometric constraints:**
   - We have several lines and points with specific lengths: \( FC = 12 \), \( DF = 8 \), \( AB = 15 \).
   - \( AD = x \) is what we need to determine.
   - \( A, B, C, F \) lie on a circle centered at \( E \) with radius 4.0.
   - \( A \) is on line \( BD \) and \( F \) is on line \( DC \).

2. **Summarize relevant findings:**
   - The circle centered at \( E \) with radius 4.0 and points \( A, B, C, F \) on it suggests \( A, B, C, F \) are equidistant from \( E \).
   - Points \( A, B, C, F \) being on the circle and segments like \( AB \) being 15 could imply a cyclic quadrilateral or another specific geometric configuration.
   - \( A \) lying on \( BD \) and \( F \) on \( DC \) indicates these lines are chords or secants related to the circle.

3. **Explore possible configurations:**
   - Since \( A, B, C, F \) are on the circle, consider the possibility of a cyclic quadrilateral \( ABCF \).
   - Use the power of a point theorem or Ptolemy’s theorem for cyclic quadrilaterals to relate the segments.

4. **Apply geometric theorems:**
   - **Ptolemy’s Theorem** for cyclic quadrilateral \( ABCF \): 
     \[
     AB \cdot CF + AF \cdot BC = AC \cdot BF
     \]
   - Given \( AB = 15 \), \( CF = 12 \), and \( DF = 8 \), we need to find \( AF \) and \( BC \).
   - Since \( F \) lies on \( DC \), \( DF + FC = DC = 20 \).

5. **Calculate using Ptolemy’s Theorem:**
   - Assume \( AF = 4 \) and \( BF = 4 \) (since \( F \) is on the circle with radius 4).
   - Use \( DF = 8 \) and \( FC = 12 \) to find \( DC = 20 \).
   - Assume \( AC = x + 8 \) (since \( A \) is on \( BD \) and \( D \) is on \( DC \)).
   - Substitute into Ptolemy’s:
     \[
     15 \cdot 12 + 4 \cdot BC = (x + 8) \cdot 4
     \]
     \[
     180 + 4 \cdot BC = 4x + 32
     \]
     \[
     4 \cdot BC = 4x + 32 - 180
     \]
     \[
     4 \cdot BC = 4x - 148
     \]
     \[
     BC = x - 37
     \]

6. **Reassess and refine:**
   - Since \( BC \) must be positive, \( x > 37 \) is not possible given the constraints.
   - Re-evaluate assumptions about \( AF \) and \( BF \) using circle properties.
   - Consider \( A, B, C, F \) forming a rectangle or square due to symmetry and equal radii.

7. **Recalculate using symmetry:**
   - If \( A, B, C, F \) form a rectangle, \( AB = CF = 15 \) and \( AF = BF = 4 \).
   - Use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \( ADF \):
     \[
     AD^2 + DF^2 = AF^2
     \]
     \[
     x^2 + 8^2 = 4^2
     \]
     \[
     x^2 + 64 = 16
     \]
     \[
     x^2 = 16 - 64
     \]
     \[
     x^2 = -48
     \]
   - Reassess: \( AD \) is not directly calculable this way.

8. **Finalize using correct geometric configuration:**
   - Consider \( A, B, C, F \) forming a kite or another symmetric shape.
   - Use \( AD = \sqrt{AB^2 - BF^2} \) since \( A, B, F \) are symmetric about \( E \).
   - \( AD = \sqrt{15^2 - 4^2} = \sqrt{225 - 16} = \sqrt{209} \approx 14.5 \).

9. **Compare with answer choices:**
   - Closest to 14.5 is 15.

10. **Select the closest answer:**
    - The closest answer choice is \( C. 12 \), but given the calculations, \( D. 15 \) is more appropriate.

</think>

<Solution>
The configuration of points \( A, B, C, F \) on the circle and the given lengths suggest a symmetric arrangement. Using the properties of the circle and symmetry, we find that the length \( AD \) is closest to 15. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: D. 15
