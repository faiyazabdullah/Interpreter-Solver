### Thought Section

1. **Analyze the Given Constraints:**
   - We have several geometric constraints involving points and lines, such as lengths and collinearities. 
   - Key lengths provided are \( UJ = 9 \), \( JV = 3 \), and \( ZT = 18 \).

2. **Understand the Relationships:**
   - \( V \) lies on line \( ZU \), which means \( Z, V, U \) are collinear.
   - \( J \) lies on line \( ZT \) and line \( UY \), indicating \( Z, J, T \) and \( U, J, Y \) are collinear.
   - \( S \) lies on line \( UT \), and \( J \) lies on line \( SV \), indicating \( S, T, U \) and \( S, J, V \) are collinear.
   - Several equal lengths are given: \( ST = UT \), \( ZV = UV \), \( SY = YZ \).

3. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the length \( SV \).

4. **Apply Geometric Properties:**
   - Since \( J \) lies on line \( ZT \) and \( ZT = 18 \), we can express \( ZJ + JT = 18 \).
   - Given \( JV = 3 \) and \( V \) lies on \( ZU \), we can express \( ZV = UV \). Let \( ZV = x \), then \( UV = x \).
   - Since \( UJ = 9 \) and \( JV = 3 \), \( UV = UJ + JV = 9 + 3 = 12 \). Thus, \( x = 12 \), so \( ZV = 12 \).

5. **Use Collinear Properties:**
   - Since \( Z, J, T \) are collinear and \( ZT = 18 \), and \( ZV = 12 \), \( JV = 3 \), we have \( ZJ = ZV - JV = 12 - 3 = 9 \).
   - Therefore, \( JT = ZT - ZJ = 18 - 9 = 9 \).

6. **Use Equal Lengths:**
   - \( ST = UT \) implies \( S \) is the midpoint of \( UT \).
   - \( SY = YZ \) implies \( Y \) is the midpoint of \( SZ \).

7. **Calculate \( SV \):**
   - Since \( S, J, V \) are collinear, \( SV = SJ + JV \).
   - \( ST = UT \) implies \( S \) is the midpoint of \( UT \), and since \( UJ = 9 \), \( UT = 18 \) (because \( ST = UT \) and \( S \) is midpoint).
   - \( SJ = SU - UJ = 9 - 9 = 0 \) (since \( S \) is midpoint of \( UT \) and \( UJ = 9 \)).
   - Therefore, \( SV = SJ + JV = 0 + 3 = 3 \).

8. **Verify and Compare:**
   - The calculated \( SV = 3 \) matches one of the answer choices.

### Solution Section

Based on the analysis and calculations, the length \( SV \) is determined to be 3. This matches answer choice A.
