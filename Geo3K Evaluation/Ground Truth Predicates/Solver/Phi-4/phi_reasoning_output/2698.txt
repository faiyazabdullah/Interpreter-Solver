1. **Analyze the Given Constraints:**
   - We are given that \( \overline{TY} \) has length \( 4x \).
   - We are given that \( \overline{BW} \) has length \( 2x + 10 \).
   - Points \( T \), \( Y \), and \( W \) lie on the circle centered at \( A \) with a radius of 3.0.
   - Triangles \( \triangle WTY \) and \( \triangle TWY \) are congruent (\( \triangle WTY \cong \triangle TWY \)).

2. **Understand the Implications of Congruency:**
   - Congruent triangles \( \triangle WTY \cong \triangle TWY \) imply that all corresponding sides and angles are equal.
   - This means \( \overline{WT} = \overline{TW} \), \( \overline{TY} = \overline{YW} \), and \( \overline{WY} = \overline{YT} \).

3. **Apply the Circle's Properties:**
   - Since \( T \), \( Y \), and \( W \) are all on the circle with radius 3.0, the maximum distance between any two points on the circle (chord length) is 6.0 (diameter).
   - Given that all sides of the triangles are chord lengths, each must be less than or equal to 6.0.

4. **Set Up Equations Using Congruence:**
   - From congruence and the given lengths: 
     - \( \overline{TY} = 4x \)
     - \( \overline{TW} = \overline{WY} = 4x \) (because \( \overline{TY} = \overline{YW} \) from congruence)
     - \( \overline{WT} = \overline{TW} = 4x \)

5. **Use the Circle Property to Formulate Inequalities:**
   - Since all sides are chords, \( 4x \leq 6.0 \).
   - This gives \( x \leq 1.5 \).

6. **Consider the Length of \( \overline{BW} \):**
   - We are given \( \overline{BW} = 2x + 10 \).
   - This length is not directly constrained by the circle's radius, but it must be consistent with the problem's setup.

7. **Reconcile All Information:**
   - We need \( 4x \) to be a valid chord length, so \( x \leq 1.5 \).
   - Check if any \( x \) from the answer choices satisfies both the triangle congruence and the circle constraints.

8. **Evaluate Answer Choices:**
   - \( A. \, x = 2 \): \( 4x = 8 \), which exceeds the maximum chord length of 6.0. Not possible.
   - \( B. \, x = 4 \): \( 4x = 16 \), which also exceeds 6.0. Not possible.
   - \( C. \, x = 5 \): \( 4x = 20 \), which also exceeds 6.0. Not possible.
   - \( D. \, x = 10 \): \( 4x = 40 \), which also exceeds 6.0. Not possible.

9. **Reassess the Problem:**
   - Since none of the choices directly satisfy \( 4x \leq 6.0 \), consider the closest possible value.
   - The closest \( x \) that does not exceed the maximum chord length is \( x = 1.5 \), but this is not an option.
   - Re-evaluate the constraints: \( \overline{BW} = 2x + 10 \) does not directly affect the triangle's side lengths but ensures consistency.

10. **Select the Closest Valid Option:**
    - Given the constraints, \( x = 2 \) is the smallest value that allows for a feasible interpretation of the problem, assuming a potential oversight in the problem's setup or intended interpretation.
    - \( \overline{BW} = 2(2) + 10 = 14 \), which does not contradict any given information directly.

11. **Final Decision:**
    - Choose the closest valid \( x \) based on the constraints and the problem's setup.

- The closest valid choice that allows for a feasible interpretation of the problem, considering the constraints and the congruence of triangles, is \( x = 2 \).
