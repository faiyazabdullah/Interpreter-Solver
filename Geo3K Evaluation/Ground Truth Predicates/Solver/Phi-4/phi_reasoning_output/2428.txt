**Thought Section**

**Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Constraints**

- We have several points (S, K, L, M, P, J, N) and lines (Line(K, L) and Line(S, R)) described in the constraints.
- Points K, L, M, P, J, N lie on the same circle with center R and radius 2.0.
- Point S lies on Line(K, L) and Line(S, R) is perpendicular to Line(S, L).

**Step 2: Identify the Problem**

- The question asks for the measure of a central angle of a regular polygon inscribed in a circle.
- Regular polygons have equal central angles, which are calculated based on the number of sides (n) of the polygon.

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems**

- For a regular polygon inscribed in a circle, the measure of each central angle is given by the formula:
  \[
  \text{Central Angle} = \frac{360^\circ}{n}
  \]
- We need to determine the number of sides (n) of the polygon.

**Step 4: Determine the Number of Sides**

- From the constraints, we have six distinct points (K, L, M, P, J, N) on the circle.
- These points could potentially be vertices of a regular polygon inscribed in the circle.

**Step 5: Calculate the Central Angle**

- If these six points form a regular hexagon, then \( n = 6 \).
- Substitute \( n = 6 \) into the formula for the central angle:
  \[
  \text{Central Angle} = \frac{360^\circ}{6} = 60^\circ
  \]

**Step 6: Verify and Compare**

- Verify that a regular hexagon fits the description of a regular polygon with six vertices on the circle.
- Compare the calculated central angle of \( 60^\circ \) with the answer choices: A. 30, B. 60, C. 90, D. 120.
- The calculated central angle matches choice B.

**Step 7: Finalize the Answer**

- Since the calculated central angle is exactly one of the answer choices, select it.
- No need to choose the closest option as the calculated angle matches exactly.

**Solution Section**

Based on the analysis and calculations, the measure of the central angle of a regular polygon (hexagon) inscribed in the circle is \( 60^\circ \). This matches answer choice B.

Final Answer: B
