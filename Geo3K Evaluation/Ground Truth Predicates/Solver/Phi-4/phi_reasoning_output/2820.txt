**Thought Section:**

1. **Analyze the Given Constraints:**
   - The length of line segment \( AB \) is 4 units.
   - Point \( B \) lies on a circle centered at \( A \) with some radius \( r \).

2. **Identify the Geometry Involved:**
   - Since point \( B \) lies on the circle with center \( A \) and radius \( r \), the distance \( AB \) is equal to the radius \( r \).
   - Given \( AB = 4 \), it follows that the radius \( r = 4 \).

3. **Determine the Figure:**
   - The constraints suggest that the figure involves a circle with center \( A \) and radius 4.
   - The problem likely asks for the area of this circle.

4. **Apply Relevant Formulas:**
   - The area \( A \) of a circle is given by the formula \( A = \pi r^2 \).
   - Substitute \( r = 4 \) into the formula: 
     \[
     A = \pi \times 4^2 = 16\pi
     \]

5. **Calculate the Area:**
   - Use the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \).
   - Calculate \( 16\pi \):
     \[
     16 \times 3.1416 \approx 50.2656
     \]

6. **Round to the Nearest Tenth:**
   - Round 50.2656 to the nearest tenth, which is 50.3.

7. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated area is 50.3.
   - Compare this with the given answer choices: 12.6, 25.1, 48.0, 50.2.
   - The closest choice to 50.3 is 50.2.

8. **Select the Closest Answer:**
   - Since 50.2 is the closest to 50.3, select option D.

**Reassess and Verify:**
- Double-check calculations: \( 16 \times 3.1416 = 50.2656 \).
- Confirm rounding: 50.2656 rounds to 50.3.
- Confirm the closest choice: 50.2 is indeed the closest to 50.3.

**Conclusion:**
- The solution process confirms that the area of the circle is approximately 50.3, and the closest answer choice is 50.2.

**Solution Section:**

The area of the circle with radius 4 is calculated as follows:
- Use the formula for the area of a circle: \( A = \pi r^2 \).
- Substitute \( r = 4 \): 
  \[
  A = \pi \times 4^2 = 16\pi
  \]
- Approximate \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \):
  \[
  A \approx 16 \times 3.1416 = 50.2656
  \]
- Round 50.2656 to the nearest tenth: 50.3.
- The closest answer choice to 50.3 is 50.2.
