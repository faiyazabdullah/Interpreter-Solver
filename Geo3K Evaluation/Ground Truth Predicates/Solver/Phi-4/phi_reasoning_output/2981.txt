1. **Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints:**
   - We are given that \( \text{LengthOf(Line(D, B))} = 12 \) and \( \text{LengthOf(Line(A, C))} = 22 \).
   - In a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles.

2. **Identify What Needs to be Found:**
   - We need to find the area of the rhombus.

3. **Recall the Formula for the Area of a Rhombus:**
   - The area \( A \) of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula involving its diagonals: 
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2
     \]
   - Where \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \) are the lengths of the diagonals.

4. **Assign the Given Diagonal Lengths:**
   - Here, \( d_1 = \text{LengthOf(Line(D, B))} = 12 \) and \( d_2 = \text{LengthOf(Line(A, C))} = 22 \).

5. **Calculate the Area Using the Formula:**
   - Substitute the given diagonal lengths into the area formula:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \times 22
     \]

6. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Compute the product of the diagonals:
     \[
     12 \times 22 = 264
     \]
   - Now calculate the area:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 264 = 132
     \]

7. **Compare with the Given Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated area of the rhombus is 132.
   - The given choices are: A. 33, B. 66, C. 132, D. 264.

8. **Select the Closest Answer:**
   - The calculated area, 132, matches choice C.

9. **Finalize the Answer:**
   - Since 132 is an exact match, select C as the answer.
</think>

<Solution>
The area of the rhombus, calculated using the given lengths of the diagonals, is 132. This matches answer choice C. Therefore, the correct choice is:

Final Answer: C
