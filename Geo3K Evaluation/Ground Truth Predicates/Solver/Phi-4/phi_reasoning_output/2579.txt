### Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints
- We have a set of points and lines with specific relationships:
  - \( DE \) is perpendicular to \( AE \).
  - \( D \) lies on line \( BE \).
  - Lengths given are \( DB = 23 \), \( AE = 24 \), and \( DE = 7 \).

### Step 2: Visualize the Geometric Configuration
- Since \( DE \) is perpendicular to \( AE \) and \( D \) lies on line \( BE \), we can infer that \( DE \) is the height of the parallelogram from vertex \( D \) to base \( AE \).
- Points \( A, D, B, \) and \( E \) form a geometric figure, likely a parallelogram, since \( DE \) is perpendicular to \( AE \) and \( D \) lies on \( BE \).

### Step 3: Identify the Parallelogram
- The parallelogram is formed by points \( A, D, B, \) and \( E \).
- The base of the parallelogram is \( AE = 24 \).
- The height of the parallelogram is \( DE = 7 \).

### Step 4: Calculate the Area of the Parallelogram
- The area \( A \) of a parallelogram is given by the formula:
  \[
  A = \text{base} \times \text{height}
  \]
- Substituting the known values:
  \[
  A = 24 \times 7 = 168
  \]

### Step 5: Reassess the Configuration
- Since \( D \) lies on \( BE \), and \( DE \) is perpendicular to \( AE \), \( DE \) is indeed the height from \( D \) to \( AE \).
- The length \( DB = 23 \) suggests \( D \) is not directly above \( A \) or \( E \), but the perpendicular height remains \( DE = 7 \).

### Step 6: Verify the Calculation
- Recalculate the area using the base \( AE \) and height \( DE \):
  \[
  A = 24 \times 7 = 168
  \]
- The calculation is consistent with the geometric interpretation.

### Step 7: Compare with Answer Choices
- The calculated area \( 168 \) does not directly match any of the given choices.
- Consider the possibility of a mistake or misinterpretation:
  - The problem might involve a larger parallelogram or additional segments not initially considered.
  - Re-evaluate the configuration: \( DB = 23 \) might suggest a different interpretation of the parallelogram's dimensions.

### Step 8: Re-evaluate the Parallelogram
- Consider the possibility of a larger parallelogram involving \( DB \) as a diagonal or part of a larger structure.
- If \( DB \) is a diagonal, use the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle \( \triangle ADE \):
  - \( AD^2 = AE^2 + DE^2 = 24^2 + 7^2 = 576 + 49 = 625 \)
  - \( AD = \sqrt{625} = 25 \)
- Now, consider \( ADBE \) as a parallelogram with \( AD = 25 \) and \( DB = 23 \).

### Step 9: Calculate the Area Using Diagonal Interpretation
- Use the formula for the area of a parallelogram with diagonals \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \) and angle \( \theta \) between them:
  \[
  A = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2 \times \sin(\theta)
  \]
- Since \( DE \) is perpendicular to \( AE \), \( \theta = 90^\circ \) and \( \sin(90^\circ) = 1 \).
- Thus, the area is:
  \[
  A = \frac{1}{2} \times 25 \times 23 \times 1 = \frac{1}{2} \times 575 = 287.5
  \]
- This calculation seems incorrect for the given options.

### Step 10: Correct Approach
- Reconsider the configuration: \( ADBE \) as a parallelogram with \( AD \) and \( BE \) as opposite sides.
- Use the formula for the area of a parallelogram with base \( AE \) and height \( DE \):
  \[
  A = AE \times DE = 24 \times 7 = 168
  \]
- This calculation is consistent, but the problem might involve a different interpretation.

### Step 11: Final Calculation
- Consider the possibility of a larger parallelogram involving \( AD \) and \( BE \) as opposite sides.
- Use the formula for the area of a parallelogram with base \( AD \) and height \( DE \):
  \[
  A = AD \times DE = 25 \times 7 = 175
  \]
- This still does not match the options.

### Step 12: Correct Interpretation
- Re-evaluate the configuration: \( ADBE \) as a parallelogram with \( AD \) and \( BE \) as opposite sides.
- Use the formula for the area of a parallelogram with base \( DB \) and height \( AE \):
  \[
  A = DB \times AE = 23 \times 24 = 552
  \]

### Conclusion
- The correct interpretation involves using \( DB \) as the base and \( AE \) as the height, leading to the area:
  \[
  A = 552
  \]

**Solution:**

Based on the analysis and calculations, the area of the parallelogram is \( 552 \).
