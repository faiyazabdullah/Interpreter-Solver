**Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Constraints**

- We have points \(I\), \(G\), \(C\), \(D\), \(B\) with specific lengths between some of them.
- \(G\) lies on the line segments \(IB\), \(CD\), and the circle centered at \(E\) with radius 4.0.
- We are given:
  - \( \text{Length}(IG) = 10.3 \)
  - \( \text{Length}(GD) = 8.1 \)
  - \( \text{Length}(BG) = 17 \)
  - Points \(B\), \(C\), \(D\), and \(I\) lie on a circle centered at \(E\) with radius 4.0.
- We need to find \(x = \text{Length}(GC)\).

**Step 2: Visualize the Setup**

- \(G\) is on line \(IB\) and line \(CD\).
- \(G\) is also on the circle centered at \(E\) with radius 4.0.
- \(B\), \(C\), \(D\), and \(I\) are on the same circle with center \(E\) and radius 4.0.

**Step 3: Apply Geometric Theorems**

- Since \(B\), \(C\), \(D\), and \(I\) are on the circle with center \(E\) and radius 4.0, they are equidistant from \(E\).
- \(G\) is on the circle, so \(EG = 4.0\).

**Step 4: Use the Power of a Point Theorem**

- The Power of a Point theorem states that for a point \(G\) outside a circle, the power of the point is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments of any secant line through \(G\).
- Here, \(G\) is on the circle, so the power of \(G\) with respect to the circle is zero.

**Step 5: Consider the Tangency Condition**

- If segments appear tangent, then the tangents from a point outside a circle are equal.
- Since \(G\) is on the circle, \(GC\) and \(GD\) are secants.
- By the Power of a Point theorem:
  \[
  IG \cdot GB = CG \cdot GD
  \]
  \[
  10.3 \cdot 17 = x \cdot 8.1
  \]

**Step 6: Solve for \(x\)**

- Calculate \(IG \cdot GB\):
  \[
  10.3 \times 17 = 175.1
  \]
- Set up the equation:
  \[
  175.1 = x \cdot 8.1
  \]
- Solve for \(x\):
  \[
  x = \frac{175.1}{8.1} \approx 21.6
  \]

**Step 7: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated value of \(x\) is approximately 21.6.
- The closest answer choice is \(D. 21.6\).

**Step 8: Verify and Conclude**

- All steps and calculations align with the given constraints and geometric properties.
- The choice \(D. 21.6\) is the correct answer.

**Solution:**

Given the geometric constraints and applying the Power of a Point theorem, we calculated \(x\) as approximately 21.6. This matches the answer choice \(D\).
