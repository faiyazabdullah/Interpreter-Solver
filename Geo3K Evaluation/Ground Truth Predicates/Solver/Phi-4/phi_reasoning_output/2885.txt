**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

We are given the lengths of certain segments in a pentagon \( A B C D E \) and another pentagon \( P Q R S T \), with the information that these pentagons are similar. The given lengths are:
- \( DE = 14 \)
- \( SD = 8 \)
- \( ST = 6 \)
- \( AE = 11 \)

We need to find the length of \( SR \) in the pentagon \( P Q R S T \).

**Step 2: Understand the Concept of Similarity**

Since the pentagons \( A B C D E \) and \( P Q R S T \) are similar, corresponding sides are proportional. Therefore, the ratio of any two corresponding sides in the pentagons is constant.

**Step 3: Identify Corresponding Sides**

To find \( SR \), we need to identify which sides in pentagon \( A B C D E \) correspond to \( SD \), \( ST \), and \( SR \) in pentagon \( P Q R S T \). Since \( S \) corresponds to \( D \) and \( T \) corresponds to \( E \), the segment \( DE \) in \( A B C D E \) corresponds to \( ST \) in \( P Q R S T \).

**Step 4: Calculate the Scale Factor**

The scale factor \( k \) between the two pentagons can be calculated using the corresponding sides \( DE \) and \( ST \):
\[
k = \frac{ST}{DE} = \frac{6}{14} = \frac{3}{7}
\]

**Step 5: Apply the Scale Factor to Find \( SR \)**

Since \( SD \) corresponds to a side in \( A B C D E \), we need to find the corresponding side in \( A B C D E \) to apply the scale factor. However, we don't have direct information about the corresponding side of \( SR \). Instead, we can use the fact that the ratio of any two corresponding sides is \( \frac{3}{7} \).

Assuming \( SR \) corresponds to a side in \( A B C D E \), we can express \( SR \) in terms of the scale factor:
\[
SR = k \times \text{(corresponding side in } A B C D E)
\]

Since we don't have the exact corresponding side, we use the given \( SD = 8 \) as a reference to find the corresponding side in \( A B C D E \) using the scale factor:
\[
SD = k \times \text{(corresponding side in } A B C D E)
\]
\[
8 = \frac{3}{7} \times \text{(corresponding side in } A B C D E)
\]
\[
\text{Corresponding side in } A B C D E = \frac{8 \times 7}{3} = \frac{56}{3}
\]

Now, apply the scale factor to find \( SR \):
\[
SR = k \times \frac{56}{3} = \frac{3}{7} \times \frac{56}{3} = \frac{56}{7} = 8
\]

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**

The calculated length of \( SR \) is 8. However, this does not match any of the given answer choices directly. We need to find the closest match.

The answer choices are:
- A. \( 1 \frac{5}{6} \)
- B. \( 4 \frac{4}{11} \)
- C. \( 3 \)
- D. \( 14 \frac{2}{3} \)

The closest value to 8 is \( 14 \frac{2}{3} \).

**Step 7: Select the Closest Answer**

Given the closest match, the answer choice is D.

</think>

**Solution:**

Based on the calculations and the similarity ratio, the closest answer choice to the calculated length of \( SR \) is \( 14 \frac{2}{3} \).

Final Answer: D
