**Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Constraints**

- We are given two line constraints: Point \( J \) lies on line \( LM \) and line \( NL \). This indicates that point \( J \) is on both these lines, implying that \( J \) lies on the intersection of these lines.
- We know \( LMNP \) is a rectangle and \( LKMJ \) is a parallelogram.

**Step 2: Summarize Given Measurements**

- \( LN = 10 \)
- \( LJ = 2x + 1 \)
- \( PJ = 3x - 1 \)

**Step 3: Geometric Properties and Relationships**

- In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. Therefore, \( LN = MP \) and \( LM = NP \).
- In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal, so \( LK = MJ \) and \( LM = KJ \).

**Step 4: Position and Relationships of Points**

- Since \( J \) lies on line \( NL \) and \( LM \), and \( LKMJ \) is a parallelogram, \( J \) must also lie on the diagonal of the rectangle \( LMNP \) and the parallelogram \( LKMJ \).
- Since \( J \) is on \( NL \), \( LJ \) and \( NJ \) must be parts of the diagonal \( LN \) of the rectangle.

**Step 5: Use Diagonal Properties**

- In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal. Therefore, \( LN = MP \) and they bisect each other.
- Since \( J \) lies on \( NL \), and given \( LJ = 2x + 1 \), the remaining segment \( NJ \) must be \( 10 - (2x + 1) = 9 - 2x \).

**Step 6: Use Parallelogram Properties**

- Since \( PJ = 3x - 1 \) and \( LKMJ \) is a parallelogram, \( PJ \) is parallel and equal to \( LK \).
- In parallelogram \( LKMJ \), \( LJ \) and \( PJ \) are not necessarily equal, but they are related through the properties of the parallelogram and the rectangle.

**Step 7: Set Up Equation**

- Since \( J \) lies on both \( NL \) and the diagonal of the rectangle, and considering the properties of the rectangle and parallelogram, we can set up the equation:
  \[
  LJ + NJ = LN
  \]
  \[
  (2x + 1) + (9 - 2x) = 10
  \]
  Simplifying gives:
  \[
  10 = 10
  \]
  This confirms the relationship is consistent.

- Now, consider the relationship involving \( PJ \):
  Since \( PJ \) is part of the parallelogram, and \( LJ \) and \( PJ \) are related through the geometry of the parallelogram and rectangle, we can equate:
  \[
  LJ = PJ
  \]
  \[
  2x + 1 = 3x - 1
  \]
  Solving for \( x \):
  \[
  2x + 1 = 3x - 1
  \]
  \[
  1 + 1 = 3x - 2x
  \]
  \[
  2 = x
  \]

**Step 8: Verification**

- Substitute \( x = 2 \) back into the expressions for \( LJ \) and \( PJ \):
  \[
  LJ = 2(2) + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5
  \]
  \[
  PJ = 3(2) - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5
  \]
- Both \( LJ \) and \( PJ \) are equal, confirming the solution is consistent with the properties of the parallelogram.

**Step 9: Conclusion**

- The value of \( x \) that satisfies all the given conditions is \( x = 2 \).

Solution section: Based on the analysis and calculations, the correct value of \( x \) is 2. Therefore, the correct answer choice is:
