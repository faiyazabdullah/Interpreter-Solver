1. **Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints:**
   - The angle \( \angle(G, K, H) \) is given as 122 degrees.
   - Point \( K \) lies on the line \( GJ \), suggesting that \( GJ \) is a line passing through \( K \).
   - Points \( L, H, J, \) and \( G \) all lie on a circle centered at \( K \) with radius \( r \).

2. **Identify Key Information:**
   - \( GJ \) is a diameter of the circle centered at \( K \). This implies that \( G \) and \( J \) are endpoints of a line passing through the circle's center, \( K \).
   - A circle's diameter subtends a right angle to any point on the circle, hence \( \angle(G, L, J) \) is the angle formed by the points \( G, L, \) and \( J \) where \( L \) lies on the circle.

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems:**
   - The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that an angle subtended by a diameter of a circle is a right angle (90 degrees).
   - Since \( GJ \) is the diameter, any angle \( \angle(GLJ)\) formed by points on the circle with endpoints \( G \) and \( J \) must be a right angle.

4. **Verification and Calculation:**
   - With \( GJ \) as the diameter, by the Inscribed Angle Theorem, \( \angle(GLJ) = 90 \) degrees.

5. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated measure of \( \angle(GLJ) \) is 90 degrees.
   - The answer choices are: A. 90, B. 120, C. 180, D. 360.

6. **Select the Closest Match:**
   - Since 90 degrees exactly matches choice A, it is the correct answer.

</think>
**Solution:**

Based on the geometric constraints and applying the Inscribed Angle Theorem, we determine that the angle \( \angle(GLJ) \) subtended by the diameter \( GJ \) is a right angle, measuring 90 degrees. Therefore, the correct answer is:
