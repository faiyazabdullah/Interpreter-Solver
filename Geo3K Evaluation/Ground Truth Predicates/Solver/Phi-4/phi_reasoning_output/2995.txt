**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

We are given the following constraints:
- Length of line \( CB = 11 \).
- Measure of angle \( \angle BCD = 20x - 4 \).
- Length of line \( XW = 2x + 5 \).
- Measure of angle \( \angle CBD = 24x + 5 \).
- Measure of angle \( \angle XWY = 77 \).

Additionally, we know that \( \triangle BCD \cong \triangle WXY \).

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**

We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the congruence condition for the triangles \( \triangle BCD \) and \( \triangle WXY \).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**

Since the triangles are congruent, corresponding sides and angles must be equal. This gives us the following correspondences:

1. \( CB \leftrightarrow XW \)
2. \( \angle BCD \leftrightarrow \angle XWY \)
3. \( \angle CBD \leftrightarrow \) another angle in \( \triangle WXY \) (not directly given).

**Step 4: Set Up Equations Based on Congruence**

From the congruence conditions, we can set up the following equations:

- \( CB = XW \) implies:
  \[
  11 = 2x + 5
  \]

- \( \angle BCD = \angle XWY \) implies:
  \[
  20x - 4 = 77
  \]

**Step 5: Solve the Equations**

**Equation 1:**
\[
11 = 2x + 5
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
6 = 2x
\]
Divide by 2:
\[
x = 3
\]

**Equation 2:**
\[
20x - 4 = 77
\]
Add 4 to both sides:
\[
20x = 81
\]
Divide by 20:
\[
x = 4.05
\]

**Step 6: Verify and Compare**

We have two potential values for \( x \): 3 and 4.05. Since \( x \) must be an integer (as per the answer choices), we choose the closest integer value, which is \( x = 3 \).

**Step 7: Check Consistency**

- For \( x = 3 \):
  - \( CB = 11 \) and \( XW = 2(3) + 5 = 11 \), which matches.
  - \( \angle BCD = 20(3) - 4 = 60 - 4 = 56 \), which does not match \( \angle XWY = 77 \). However, this discrepancy suggests that \( \angle CBD \) might correspond to another angle in \( \triangle WXY \).

- For \( x = 4 \):
  - \( CB = 11 \) and \( XW = 2(4) + 5 = 13 \), which does not match.

Thus, \( x = 3 \) is the only consistent solution for the side lengths, and any discrepancy in angle measures suggests a different angle correspondence.

**Step 8: Select the Closest Answer**

Given the calculations, the closest integer solution is \( x = 3 \).

**Solution**

Based on the analysis and calculations, the value of \( x \) that satisfies the congruence conditions for the triangles is \( x = 3 \). Therefore, the correct answer choice is:
