1. **Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints:**
   - We have several lines and points with specific conditions:
     - Length(D, F) is 14, meaning DF = 14.
     - Points E, G, I, and M lie on specific lines and circles centered at H with radius 7.
     - There are multiple perpendicular conditions among the lines.

2. **Identify the Key Geometric Configuration:**
   - The problem states that a square is circumscribed around the circle centered at H with a radius of 7. 
   - When a square is circumscribed around a circle, the circle is inscribed within the square, meaning the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square.

3. **Calculate the Diameter of the Circle:**
   - Given the radius of the circle is 7, the diameter is twice the radius.
   - Diameter = 2 * 7 = 14.

4. **Relate the Diameter to the Square:**
   - Since the square is circumscribed around the circle, the side length of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle.
   - Therefore, the side length of the square is 14.

5. **Calculate the Circumference of the Circle:**
   - The circumference \( C \) of a circle is given by the formula \( C = \pi \times \text{diameter} \).
   - Substituting the diameter we found, \( C = \pi \times 14 = 14\pi \).

6. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated circumference is \( 14\pi \).
   - The answer choices are:
     - A. \( 7\pi \)
     - B. \( 14\pi \)
     - C. \( 21\pi \)
     - D. \( 28\pi \)
   - The calculated result \( 14\pi \) matches choice B.

7. **Verify the Logical Consistency:**
   - All constraints and calculations have been checked for consistency.
   - The relationship between the square and the circle is correctly applied.

8. **Finalize the Answer:**
   - Based on the calculations and logical deductions, the correct choice is B.

<Solution>
1. The square is circumscribed around the circle, meaning the side length of the square is equal to the circle's diameter.
2. The circle's radius is given as 7, so the diameter is \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \).
3. The circumference of the circle is calculated using the formula \( C = \pi \times \text{diameter} \).
4. Substituting the diameter, we get \( C = 14\pi \).
5. The answer choice that matches this calculation is B. \( 14\pi \).

Final Answer: B
