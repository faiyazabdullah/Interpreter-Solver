**Step 1: Analyze the Problem Statement**
- We are given a trapezoid \(ABCD\) with parallel sides \(AB\) and \(CD\).
- \(S\) and \(T\) are midpoints of the non-parallel sides \(AD\) and \(BC\), respectively.
- We know \(CD = 14\), \(ST = 10\), and \(AB = 2x\). We need to find \(x\).

**Step 2: Identify Key Theorem**
- The segment connecting the midpoints of the legs of a trapezoid (line segment \(ST\)) is called the midsegment.
- The length of the midsegment in a trapezoid is the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides. Thus, the formula is:
  \[
  ST = \frac{AB + CD}{2}
  \]

**Step 3: Apply the Formula**
- Substitute the known values into the formula:
  \[
  10 = \frac{2x + 14}{2}
  \]

**Step 4: Solve for \(x\)**
- Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
  \[
  20 = 2x + 14
  \]
- Subtract 14 from both sides:
  \[
  6 = 2x
  \]
- Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \(x\):
  \[
  x = 3
  \]

**Step 5: Verification**
- Verify the calculations:
  - Using \(x = 3\), \(AB = 2x = 6\).
  - Check the midsegment formula:
    \[
    ST = \frac{6 + 14}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
    \]
  - This matches the given \(ST = 10\).

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated value of \(x\) is 3.
- Check the answer choices: A. 2, B. 3, C. 10, D. 14.
- The correct choice is B. 3.

**Step 7: Final Conclusion**
- The calculations are consistent with the given conditions and the properties of the trapezoid.
- The final answer is consistent with one of the provided choices.

**Solution:**
- Based on the calculations and verification, the value of \(x\) is determined to be 3.
- The correct answer choice is B.
