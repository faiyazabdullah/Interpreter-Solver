1. **Analyze the Given Constraints:**
   - We have two main constraints:
     - \( \text{LengthOf(Line(A, B))} = 3 \): This indicates that the distance between points A and B is 3 units.
     - \( \text{PointLiesOnCircle(B, Circle(A, radius\_0\_0))} \): This indicates that point B lies on a circle centered at A with radius \( r \).

2. **Summarize the Implications:**
   - The distance from A to B being 3 units implies that the radius \( r \) of the circle is also 3 units because B lies on the circle centered at A.

3. **Identify What Needs to be Found:**
   - We need to find the area of the figure. Given the context, it is reasonable to assume the figure is the circle centered at A with radius 3.

4. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
   - The area \( A \) of a circle is given by the formula \( A = \pi r^2 \).
   - Substitute the radius \( r = 3 \) into the formula:
     \[
     A = \pi \times 3^2 = 9\pi
     \]

5. **Calculate the Area:**
   - Using the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), calculate:
     \[
     A \approx 9 \times 3.14159 \approx 28.27431
     \]

6. **Round to the Nearest Tenth:**
   - Round 28.27431 to the nearest tenth, which is 28.3.

7. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated area is 28.3, which matches option C.

8. **Reassess and Verify:**
   - Double-check calculations and ensure that the interpretation of the problem aligns with the constraints given.
   - The interpretation that the figure is the circle centered at A with radius 3 is consistent with the constraints.

9. **Finalize the Solution:**
   - The closest answer choice to the calculated area is 28.3, which corresponds to option C.

<Solution>
Based on the analysis and calculations, the area of the circle with radius 3 is approximately 28.3 when rounded to the nearest tenth. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: C
