1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have two points \( W \) and \( N \) lying on a circle centered at \( I \) with radius \( \text{radius}_0_0 \).
   - Triangle \( \triangle IWN \) is equilateral.
   - The distance \( WN = 5 \).

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the measure of the angle \(\widehat{WNI}\) in radians.

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Properties:**
   - Since \(\triangle IWN\) is equilateral, all sides are equal. Therefore, \( IW = IN = WN = 5 \).
   - In an equilateral triangle, each internal angle is \(60^\circ\) or \(\frac{\pi}{3}\) radians.

4. **Understand the Circle Context:**
   - The angle \(\widehat{WNI}\) is the angle subtended by the arc \(WN\) at the center \(I\).
   - In a circle, the angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice the angle subtended at any point on the circumference.

5. **Calculate the Central Angle:**
   - Since \(\triangle IWN\) is equilateral, the angle \(\angle WIN = \frac{\pi}{3}\).
   - The central angle \(\widehat{WNI}\) is twice the angle \(\angle WIN\), so \(\widehat{WNI} = 2 \times \frac{\pi}{3} = \frac{2\pi}{3}\).

6. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - Convert \(\frac{2\pi}{3}\) to a form similar to the answer choices:
     - \(\frac{2\pi}{3} \approx 2.094\) radians.
   - Compare with the given choices:
     - A. \(\frac{3}{5}\pi \approx 1.884\)
     - B. \(\frac{5}{3}\pi \approx 5.236\)
     - C. \(5\pi \approx 15.708\)
     - D. \(10\pi \approx 31.416\)
   - The closest value to \(\frac{2\pi}{3}\) is \(\frac{3}{5}\pi\).

7. **Select the Closest Answer:**
   - The closest answer to \(\frac{2\pi}{3}\) is \(\frac{3}{5}\pi\).

<Solution>
1. Given that \(\triangle IWN\) is equilateral, each internal angle is \(\frac{\pi}{3}\).
2. The central angle \(\widehat{WNI}\) is twice the internal angle at \(I\), so \(\widehat{WNI} = 2 \times \frac{\pi}{3} = \frac{2\pi}{3}\).
3. Comparing \(\frac{2\pi}{3}\) with the answer choices, the closest is \(\frac{3}{5}\pi\).
4. Therefore, the correct answer is A.

Final Answer: A
