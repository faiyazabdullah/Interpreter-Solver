**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

We have several geometric constraints:
- Points \( V, R, S, T, \) and \( U \) are involved in various line and circle relationships.
- \( VR = VT = 4 \)
- \( UV = 8 \)
- \( S, U, R, \) and \( T \) all lie on a circle centered at \( A \) with radius 4.
- \( V \) lies on both line segments \( SU \) and \( RT \).

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**

- The circle constraint suggests that \( S, U, R, \) and \( T \) are equidistant from \( A \) with a radius of 4.
- Since \( V \) lies on line \( SU \) and \( RT \), it is a common point for these lines.
- \( VR = VT = 4 \) implies that \( V \) is equidistant from \( R \) and \( T \), suggesting a symmetry about \( V \).

**Step 3: Explore Geometric Relationships**

- Since \( V \) lies on both \( SU \) and \( RT \), and \( VR = VT = 4 \), \( V \) could be the midpoint of \( RT \).
- \( UV = 8 \) implies \( U \) and \( V \) are endpoints of a diameter of the circle centered at \( A \) because the radius is 4.

**Step 4: Apply Geometric Theorems**

- Since \( U \) and \( V \) are endpoints of a diameter, \( A \) is the midpoint of \( UV \).
- \( V \) being on \( SU \) and \( RT \) suggests \( V \) is a central point for these lines.
- \( S, U, R, T \) being on the circle with radius 4 and \( UV = 8 \) confirms \( U \) and \( V \) are endpoints of a diameter.

**Step 5: Calculate \( x \)**

- Since \( V \) is the midpoint of \( RT \) and \( VR = VT = 4 \), \( R \) and \( T \) are symmetric about \( V \).
- \( V \) lies on \( SU \), and \( UV = 8 \), so \( S \) and \( U \) are endpoints of another diameter.
- \( SV \) and \( VU \) are radii of the circle, so \( SV = VU = 4 \).

Thus, \( x = SV = 4 \).

**Step 6: Verify and Compare**

- The calculated \( x = 4 \) matches one of the answer choices.
- The symmetry and circle properties confirm this calculation.

**Step 7: Select the Closest Answer**

- The calculated value \( x = 4 \) is exactly one of the provided answer choices.

**Solution:**

Based on the analysis and calculations, the value of \( x \) is determined to be 4. This matches one of the given answer choices.
