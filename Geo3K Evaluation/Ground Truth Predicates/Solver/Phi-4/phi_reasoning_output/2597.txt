**Step 1: Analyze the given geometric constraints**
- We have an equilateral pentagon \(PQRST\) inscribed in a circle \(\odot U\). This means all the vertices \(P, Q, R, S, T\) lie on the circle, and each side of the pentagon is of equal length.
- The circle has a radius of 5.0, but the radius is not directly relevant to finding the angle \(\widehat{QR}\).

**Step 2: Identify what needs to be found**
- We need to find the measure of the central angle \(\widehat{QR}\) subtended by the arc \(QR\) of the circle.

**Step 3: Apply relevant geometric theorems and properties**
- Since \(PQRST\) is an equilateral pentagon, it is also a regular pentagon. In a regular pentagon, all central angles are equal.
- The sum of the central angles around a point (the center \(U\) of the circle) is \(360^\circ\).
- Since there are 5 equal central angles in a regular pentagon, each central angle is \(\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ\).

**Step 4: Verify the accuracy of the current steps**
- The calculation of dividing \(360^\circ\) by 5 is straightforward and correct for a regular pentagon.
- Each central angle corresponds to the angle subtended by one side of the pentagon at the center of the circle.

**Step 5: Compare the calculated result with the given answer choices**
- The calculated measure of \(\widehat{QR}\) is \(72^\circ\).
- This matches option B.

**Step 6: Select the closest answer choice**
- Since \(72^\circ\) is exactly one of the answer choices, we select option B.

**Solution:**

Given that \(PQRST\) is a regular pentagon inscribed in a circle, each central angle is \(\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ\). Therefore, the measure of \(\widehat{QR}\) is \(72^\circ\).
