1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have a rhombus \(FGHJ\) with diagonals intersecting at point \(K\).
   - The properties of a rhombus include:
     - All sides are equal: \(FG = GH = HJ = JF\).
     - Diagonals bisect each other at right angles and bisect the angles of the rhombus.
     - Each diagonal divides the rhombus into two congruent triangles.

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the value of \(x\) given the lengths \(GH = x + 9\) and \(JH = 5x - 2\).

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
   - Since \(FGHJ\) is a rhombus, all sides are equal. Thus, \(GH = JH\).
   - Set the expressions for \(GH\) and \(JH\) equal to each other: 
     \[
     x + 9 = 5x - 2
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Rearrange the equation to solve for \(x\):
     \[
     x + 9 = 5x - 2
     \]
     \[
     9 + 2 = 5x - x
     \]
     \[
     11 = 4x
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{11}{4} = 2.75
     \]

5. **Verify the Calculations:**
   - Check the calculation:
     - Substitute \(x = 2.75\) back into the expressions for \(GH\) and \(JH\):
     \[
     GH = 2.75 + 9 = 11.75
     \]
     \[
     JH = 5(2.75) - 2 = 13.75 - 2 = 11.75
     \]
   - Both \(GH\) and \(JH\) are equal, confirming the solution is consistent with the properties of a rhombus.

6. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated value of \(x\) is \(2.75\).
   - Among the given answer choices, \(2.75\) corresponds to option A.

7. **Reassess and Reflect:**
   - The steps followed are consistent with the properties of a rhombus and the algebraic solution.
   - The calculations are verified and consistent with the problem constraints.

8. **Finalize the Solution:**
   - The closest and correct answer choice is A.

</think>

**Solution:**

Given the properties of a rhombus and the equations derived from equal side lengths, we solved for \(x\) by setting the expressions for \(GH\) and \(JH\) equal to each other. The calculation yielded \(x = 2.75\), which matches option A.
