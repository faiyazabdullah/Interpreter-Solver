**Step 1: Analyzing the Given Information**

- We are provided with several geometric constraints:
  - \( \angle HBJ = x \)
  - \( \angle FBG = 70^\circ \)
  - Points \( J, F, G, H \) lie on a circle centered at \( B \) with radius 3.0.
  - \( \overline{JH} = \overline{FG} \)

**Step 2: Understanding the Geometry**

- Since \( J, F, G, H \) lie on a circle centered at \( B \), they form a cyclic quadrilateral.
- The key property of a cyclic quadrilateral is that opposite angles sum up to \( 180^\circ \).

**Step 3: Applying Geometric Theorems**

- Given \( \angle FBG = 70^\circ \), we need to find \( \angle HBJ = x \).
- Since \( \overline{JH} = \overline{FG} \), triangles \( \triangle JHB \) and \( \triangle FGB \) might be isosceles with respect to \( B \).

**Step 4: Exploring Possible Configurations**

- Consider the cyclic nature: \( \angle HBJ + \angle FBG = 180^\circ \) if they are opposite angles in the cyclic quadrilateral.
- Therefore, \( x + 70^\circ = 180^\circ \).

**Step 5: Calculating \( x \)**

- Solving \( x + 70^\circ = 180^\circ \) gives:
  \[
  x = 180^\circ - 70^\circ = 110^\circ
  \]

**Step 6: Reassessing the Configuration**

- Since \( \overline{JH} = \overline{FG} \), consider the possibility of symmetry or equal division of angles around \( B \).
- If \( \angle HBJ \) and \( \angle FBG \) are not directly opposite, consider the possibility of supplementary angles formed by the same arc.

**Step 7: Considering Arc Properties**

- If \( \angle FBG = 70^\circ \) subtends arc \( FG \), then the arc \( FG \) is \( 140^\circ \) (since the central angle is twice the inscribed angle).
- The remaining arc \( JH \) would be \( 360^\circ - 140^\circ = 220^\circ \).
- The angle \( \angle HBJ \) subtended by arc \( JH \) would be half of \( 220^\circ \), which is \( 110^\circ \).

**Step 8: Verifying Against Answer Choices**

- The calculated \( x = 110^\circ \) does not match any of the given choices directly.
- Re-evaluate the configuration: If \( \angle HBJ \) and \( \angle FBG \) are not directly opposite but related through symmetry or equal division:
  - Consider the possibility of \( \angle HBJ = 180^\circ - 70^\circ - 70^\circ = 40^\circ \) if symmetry or equal division applies.
  - However, this does not match any choice either.

**Step 9: Closest Match**

- Reconsider the possibility of \( \angle HBJ \) being half of the remaining arc if symmetry applies:
  - If \( \angle HBJ \) is half of \( 140^\circ \) (same arc as \( \angle FBG \)), then \( x = 70^\circ \).

**Step 10: Final Decision**

- Given the constraints and the closest logical deduction, \( x = 70^\circ \) aligns with the symmetry and arc properties.
- Therefore, the closest and most logical answer choice is \( C. 70 \).

</think>

**Solution:**

Given the cyclic nature and the symmetry of the circle, the angle \( \angle HBJ \) is deduced to be \( 70^\circ \) based on the properties of arcs and angles subtended by the same arc. Thus, the correct answer is:
