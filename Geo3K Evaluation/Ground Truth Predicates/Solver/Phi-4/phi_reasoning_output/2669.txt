**Step 1: Analyzing the given geometric constraints**

- We are given that the measure of angle AED is \( x \).
- Point E lies on the line CD.
- Line AE is perpendicular to line EC.

**Step 2: Summarizing relevant findings**

- Perpendicular lines form a right angle, which measures 90 degrees. Thus, if line AE is perpendicular to line EC, then angle AEC is 90 degrees.

**Step 3: Brainstorming new ideas**

- Since E lies on the line CD, and AE is perpendicular to EC, we know that E is the point of intersection where the perpendicular from A meets line CD.
- This means angle AEC is precisely 90 degrees.

**Step 4: Verifying the accuracy of the current steps**

- The perpendicular relationship between AE and EC directly implies that angle AEC is 90 degrees.
- Since angle AED is formed by the same lines (A, E, and D), and point E is on line CD, angle AED is equivalent to angle AEC.

**Step 5: Refining any errors**

- There are no apparent errors in the interpretation of the perpendicular relationship and the placement of point E on line CD.

**Step 6: Revisiting previous steps**

- Reconfirm that the perpendicular condition (AE ‚ä• EC) directly leads to angle AEC being 90 degrees.
- Reaffirm that angle AED is the same as angle AEC due to the collinearity of points C, E, and D.

**Step 7: Iteration and final reflection**

- All steps consistently lead to the conclusion that angle AED, denoted as \( x \), is 90 degrees.

<Solution>

Based on the analysis of the geometric constraints, we determined that angle AED is equivalent to angle AEC. Since AE is perpendicular to EC, angle AEC measures 90 degrees. Therefore, the measure of angle AED, denoted as \( x \), is 90 degrees.

Comparing this result with the given answer choices, the correct choice is:
