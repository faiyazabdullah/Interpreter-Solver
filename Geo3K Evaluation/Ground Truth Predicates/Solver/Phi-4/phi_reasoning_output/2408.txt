**Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Constraints**
- We have three lines defined by points:
  - Line(X, Z) with point N on it.
  - Line(X, Y) with point M on it.
  - Line(Z, Y) is parallel to Line(N, M).

**Step 2: Identify Given Measurements**
- \( XN = 6 \)
- \( XM = 2 \)
- \( XY = 10 \)

**Step 3: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find \( NZ \).

**Step 4: Apply Geometric Theorems and Properties**
- Since Line(Z, Y) is parallel to Line(N, M), and both lines are intersected by transversal Line(X, Y), we can use the concept of similar triangles or the intercept theorem (also known as Thales' theorem).

**Step 5: Use the Intercept Theorem**
- According to the intercept theorem, if two lines are parallel and cut by a transversal, the segments on one transversal are proportional to the segments on the other transversal.
- Therefore, the ratio \( \frac{XN}{XM} = \frac{NZ}{MY} \).

**Step 6: Calculate the Ratio**
- \( \frac{XN}{XM} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \).

**Step 7: Express MY in Terms of Known Quantities**
- Since \( XY = 10 \) and \( XM = 2 \), we have \( MY = XY - XM = 10 - 2 = 8 \).

**Step 8: Set Up the Proportion**
- Using the ratio from the intercept theorem:
  \[
  \frac{NZ}{MY} = 3 \implies NZ = 3 \times MY = 3 \times 8 = 24
  \]

**Step 9: Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated \( NZ = 24 \).

**Step 10: Select the Closest Answer**
- The answer choice that matches our calculation is C. 24.

**Solution:**
By applying the intercept theorem to the given geometric constraints, we calculated \( NZ \) using the proportionality of segments formed by parallel lines and a transversal. The calculation yielded \( NZ = 24 \), which matches answer choice C.
