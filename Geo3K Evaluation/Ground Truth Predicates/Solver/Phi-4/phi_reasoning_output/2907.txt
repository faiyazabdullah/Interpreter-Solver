1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have a geometric configuration with points A, B, C, J, K, L, M and lines formed by these points.
   - The measure of angle ∠CKB is given as 37°.
   - Point J lies on line AK, point M lies on line KB, and point L lies on line KC.
   - Line JL is perpendicular to line JK, and line MB is perpendicular to line ML.
   - The lengths of lines JL and ML are equal.

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the measure of angle ∠JKL.

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems:**
   - Since JL is perpendicular to JK, ∠JKL is a right angle (90°) initially.
   - However, we need to determine the exact measure of ∠JKL given the constraints.

4. **Examine the Perpendicularity and Length Constraints:**
   - The perpendicularity of JL to JK implies that triangle JKL is a right triangle with ∠JKL as one of its angles.
   - The equality of lengths JL = ML suggests symmetry in the configuration.

5. **Consider the Implications of Perpendicularity and Equal Lengths:**
   - Since JL is perpendicular to JK, and JL = ML, triangle JKL is isosceles with JL = ML.
   - In an isosceles right triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are equal.

6. **Use the Given Angle ∠CKB:**
   - Since ∠CKB = 37° and L lies on line KC, ∠CKL = 37°.
   - In triangle KCL, since KL is perpendicular to JC (as L lies on KC and JL is perpendicular to JK), ∠KLC = 90°.

7. **Determine the Measure of ∠JKL:**
   - In triangle KCL, the angles sum to 180°:
     - ∠CKL = 37°
     - ∠KLC = 90°
     - Therefore, ∠CLK = 180° - 37° - 90° = 53°.

8. **Relate ∠CLK to ∠JKL:**
   - Since JL is perpendicular to JK, and L is on KC, ∠JKL = ∠CLK = 53°.

9. **Verify the Calculations:**
   - The calculations are consistent with the given constraints and the properties of isosceles right triangles and perpendicular lines.

10. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
    - The calculated measure of ∠JKL is 53°, which matches choice C.

**Solution:**
- We analyzed the geometric constraints and used properties of perpendicular lines and isosceles triangles to determine that ∠JKL is 53°.
- The calculations are consistent with the given information and geometric properties.
- The closest answer choice to our calculated result is 53°.
