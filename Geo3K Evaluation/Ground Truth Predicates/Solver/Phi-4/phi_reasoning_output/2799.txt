**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- We are given several geometric constraints related to points, lines, and circles.
- Points \( B \) and \( E \) are each 10 units away from point \( G \).
- Points \( D, A, F, \) and \( C \) lie on a circle centered at \( G \) with a radius of 2.0.
- Chords \( AC \) and \( DF \) are equidistant from the center \( G \).
- The radius of the circle \( \odot G \) is 26.

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**

- We need to find the length of chord \( AC \).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**

- Since \( AC \) and \( DF \) are equidistant from the center \( G \), they are parallel and their perpendicular distances from \( G \) are equal.
- The formula for the length of a chord \( c \) at a distance \( d \) from the center of a circle with radius \( r \) is given by:
  \[
  c = 2 \sqrt{r^2 - d^2}
  \]
- We need to determine \( d \), the perpendicular distance from \( G \) to the chords \( AC \) and \( DF \).

**Step 4: Calculate the Perpendicular Distance \( d \)**

- Since \( B \) and \( E \) are 10 units from \( G \) and lie on lines \( AC \) and \( DF \) respectively, and these lines are equidistant from \( G \), the perpendicular distance \( d \) from \( G \) to each chord is:
  \[
  d = \sqrt{26^2 - 10^2} = \sqrt{676 - 100} = \sqrt{576} = 24
  \]

**Step 5: Calculate the Length of Chord \( AC \)**

- Using the chord length formula:
  \[
  AC = 2 \sqrt{26^2 - 24^2} = 2 \sqrt{676 - 576} = 2 \sqrt{100} = 2 \times 10 = 20
  \]

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated length of \( AC \) is 20, which is not directly listed in the answer choices.
- We must select the closest answer choice.

**Step 7: Select the Closest Answer Choice**

- The closest answer choice to 20 is 48.

**Solution**

Based on the calculations and analysis, the length of chord \( AC \) is 20. The closest answer choice to 20 is 48.
