**Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Constraints**
- We are given a triangle \( \triangle MNP \) with side lengths: \( MN = 39 \), \( MP = 36 \), and \( NP = 15 \).
- Additionally, \( \overline{PM} \perp \overline{PN} \). This indicates that \( \triangle MNP \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( P \).

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**
- We need to express \(\sin N\) as a decimal to the nearest hundredth. Since \( \angle N \) is an angle in the right triangle, we use the definition of sine: 
  \[
  \sin N = \frac{\text{opposite side to } N}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{MP}{MN}
  \]

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**
- Given \( \overline{PM} \perp \overline{PN} \), \( \angle N = \angle MNP \) is the angle opposite the side \( MP \).
- The hypotenuse of the triangle is \( MN \), which is the longest side. So, the sine of angle \( N \) can be calculated as:
  \[
  \sin N = \frac{MP}{MN} = \frac{36}{39}
  \]

**Step 4: Perform Calculations**
- Calculate \(\frac{36}{39}\):
  \[
  \frac{36}{39} = \frac{12}{13} \approx 0.9231
  \]
- Rounding 0.9231 to the nearest hundredth gives 0.92.

**Step 5: Compare with Given Answer Choices**
- The calculated value of \(\sin N\) is 0.92, which matches choice C.

**Step 6: Reassess and Reflect**
- Double-check calculations:
  - \(\frac{36}{39} = \frac{12}{13} \approx 0.9231\)
  - Rounding to the nearest hundredth confirms 0.92.
- No errors found in the steps; all calculations are consistent with the geometric properties.

**Step 7: Finalize the Answer**
- Based on the analysis and calculations, the closest match to 0.92 is choice C.

**Solution**

Given the constraints and calculations:
- The sine of angle \( N \) is \(\frac{36}{39} = \frac{12}{13} \approx 0.9231\).
- Rounded to the nearest hundredth, \(\sin N = 0.92\).

Therefore, the correct answer choice is C.
