1. **Analyze the given constraints**:
   - \(AB = 12\) and \(AD = 10\).
   - \(BC \perp BA\), \(AD \perp AB\), \(CD \perp CB\), and \(DC \perp DA\).
   - These perpendicularities suggest that the figure is a rectangle or square with right angles at each corner.

2. **Identify the figure**:
   - Since \(AB\) is perpendicular to \(AD\) and \(BC\) is perpendicular to \(BA\), and \(CD\) is perpendicular to \(CB\), the figure must be a rectangle.
   - In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles.

3. **Determine the dimensions of the rectangle**:
   - Given \(AB = 12\) and \(AD = 10\), the sides of the rectangle are \(AB = CD = 12\) and \(AD = BC = 10\).

4. **Calculate the area of the rectangle**:
   - The area \(A\) of a rectangle is given by the formula \(A = \text{length} \times \text{width}\).
   - Here, the length is \(12\) and the width is \(10\).
   - Therefore, \(A = 12 \times 10 = 120\).

5. **Compare with answer choices**:
   - The calculated area is \(120\), which matches option D.

6. **Verify calculations**:
   - Reassess the steps: The perpendicular constraints confirm right angles, and the given lengths are used correctly in the area formula.
   - The calculation \(12 \times 10 = 120\) is straightforward and correct.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The calculated area is \(120\), which corresponds to option D.

Solution:
Based on the analysis of the geometric constraints and the calculations performed, the area of the rectangle is \(120\). Therefore, the correct answer is:
