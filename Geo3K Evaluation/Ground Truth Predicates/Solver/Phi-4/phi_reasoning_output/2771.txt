1. **Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints:**
   - We have several expressions for line segment lengths in terms of \( x \):
     - \( \text{Length of } CD = 6x + 4 \)
     - \( \text{Length of } AE = 10x - 2 \)
     - \( \text{Length of } FB = 5x + 10 \)
   - Points lying on lines:
     - \( F \) lies on line \( AC \)
     - \( B \) lies on line \( ED \)
   - Length equalities:
     - \( \text{Length of } CF = \text{Length of } BD \)
     - \( \text{Length of } EB = \text{Length of } AF \)
   - Lines are parallel:
     - \( AE \parallel CD \)

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to solve for \( x \) using the provided constraints.

3. **Apply Relevant Theorems and Properties:**
   - Since \( AE \parallel CD \), and \( F \) lies on \( AC \), and \( B \) on \( ED \), consider the implications of parallel lines and point positions.
   - Use the given length equalities to set up equations:
     - \( CF = BD \)
     - \( EB = AF \)

4. **Express Unknown Lengths in Terms of \( x \):**
   - Since \( F \) is on \( AC \), let \( AF = y \) and \( CF = 6x + 4 - y \).
   - Since \( B \) is on \( ED \), let \( BD = z \) and \( EB = 10x - 2 - z \).
   - From \( CF = BD \), we have:
     \[
     6x + 4 - y = z
     \]
   - From \( EB = AF \), we have:
     \[
     10x - 2 - z = y
     \]

5. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - Substitute \( z = 6x + 4 - y \) into \( 10x - 2 - z = y \):
     \[
     10x - 2 - (6x + 4 - y) = y
     \]
     \[
     10x - 2 - 6x - 4 + y = y
     \]
     \[
     4x - 6 = 0
     \]
     \[
     4x = 6
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5
     \]

6. **Verify and Reassess:**
   - Check if \( x = 1.5 \) satisfies all constraints:
     - \( CD = 6(1.5) + 4 = 9 + 4 = 13 \)
     - \( AE = 10(1.5) - 2 = 15 - 2 = 13 \)
     - \( FB = 5(1.5) + 10 = 7.5 + 10 = 17.5 \)
   - Check parallel condition: \( AE \parallel CD \) is satisfied since both are equal.
   - Check length equalities:
     - \( CF = BD \) and \( EB = AF \) are consistent with the setup.

7. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - Calculated \( x = 1.5 \) does not match any provided choices directly.
   - Re-evaluate calculations or assumptions if necessary.
   - Consider if any simplification or re-evaluation of assumptions might lead to a different \( x \).

8. **Re-evaluate and Iterate:**
   - Reassess the setup:
     - Reconsider the implications of parallel lines and point positions.
     - Re-evaluate the system of equations:
       - \( 4x - 6 = 0 \) was derived correctly, but check if any assumptions were overlooked.
   - Re-calculate:
     - Reconsider \( CF = BD \) and \( EB = AF \) with different assumptions or simplifications.
     - Re-evaluate if any simplifications were missed.

     - Consider \( CF = BD \) and \( EB = AF \) with different assumptions.
