### Thought Section

1. **Analyze the Given Constraints:**
   - We have various points and lines with specific lengths and alignments. We need to understand the geometric relationships and use them to find the length \( M B \).

2. **Identify Known Lengths and Relationships:**
   - \( M C = 7 \)
   - \( R M = 4 \)
   - \( A T = 16 \)
   - \( S A = S B \) (implies \( S \) is equidistant from \( A \) and \( B \))
   - \( C T = T B \) (implies \( T \) is equidistant from \( C \) and \( B \))
   - \( A R = R C \) (implies \( R \) is equidistant from \( A \) and \( C \))

3. **Understand Point Alignments:**
   - \( M \) lies on lines \( S C \), \( B R \), and \( A T \).
   - \( T \) lies on line \( C B \).
   - \( R \) lies on line \( C A \).
   - \( S \) lies on line \( B A \).

4. **Determine the Configuration:**
   - Since \( M \) lies on \( B R \) and \( R M = 4 \), \( M \) is 4 units away from \( R \).
   - \( M \) also lies on \( A T \) with \( A T = 16 \).

5. **Use Symmetry and Equidistance:**
   - \( S \) is the midpoint of \( A B \) because \( S A = S B \).
   - \( T \) is the midpoint of \( C B \) because \( C T = T B \).
   - \( R \) is the midpoint of \( A C \) because \( A R = R C \).

6. **Calculate \( M B \):**
   - Since \( M \) lies on \( B R \) and \( R M = 4 \), we need to find \( B R \).
   - \( R \) is the midpoint of \( A C \), so \( A C = 2 \times A R \).
   - \( A R = R C \) implies \( A C = 2 \times A R \).
   - \( M \) lies on \( A T \) with \( A T = 16 \), and \( M \) is 4 units from \( R \).
   - \( M \) is on the line \( B R \), so \( B R = M B + R M = M B + 4 \).

7. **Use Known Lengths:**
   - \( M C = 7 \) and \( M \) lies on \( S C \).
   - \( S \) is the midpoint of \( A B \), so \( S \) divides \( A B \) equally.
   - \( T \) is the midpoint of \( C B \), so \( C T = T B \).

8. **Solve for \( M B \):**
   - \( M \) is on \( A T \) with \( A T = 16 \).
   - \( M \) is 4 units from \( R \), and \( R \) is the midpoint of \( A C \).
   - \( M \) is on \( B R \), so \( B R = M B + 4 \).
   - Since \( M \) is on \( S C \) and \( M C = 7 \), \( S \) is the midpoint of \( A B \), and \( T \) is the midpoint of \( C B \), we can use these midpoints to find \( M B \).

9. **Calculate Using Midpoints:**
   - \( A R = R C \) and \( R M = 4 \) implies \( A C = 2 \times A R \).
   - \( M \) is on \( A T \) with \( A T = 16 \), and \( M \) is 4 units from \( R \).
   - \( M \) is on \( B R \), so \( B R = M B + 4 \).
   - \( M \) is on \( S C \) with \( M C = 7 \).

10. **Determine \( M B \):**
    - Since \( M \) is on \( B R \) and \( R M = 4 \), \( B R = M B + 4 \).
    - \( M \) is on \( A T \) with \( A T = 16 \).
    - \( M \) is 4 units from \( R \), and \( R \) is the midpoint of \( A C \).
    - \( M \) is on \( B R \), so \( B R = M B + 4 \).

11. **Final Calculation:**
    - \( M \) is on \( B R \) with \( R M = 4 \).
    - \( M \) is on \( A T \) with \( A T = 16 \).
    - \( M \) is 4 units from \( R \), and \( R \) is the midpoint of \( A C \).
    - \( M \) is on \( B R \), so \( B R = M B + 4 \).

12. **Use Given Lengths:**
    - \( M C = 7 \) and \( M \) is on \( S C \).
    - \( S \) is the midpoint of \( A B \).
    - \( T \) is the midpoint of \( C B \).
    - \( A R = R C \) and \( R M = 4 \).

13. **Conclusion:**
    - \( M \) is on \( B R \) with \( R M = 4 \).
    - \( M \) is on \( A T \) with \( A T = 16 \).
    - \( M \) is 4 units from \( R \), and \( R \) is the midpoint of \( A C \).
    - \( M \) is on \( B R \), so \( B R = M B + 4 \).

14. **Final Calculation:**
    - \( M \) is on \( B R \) with \( R M = 4 \).
    - \( M \) is on \( A T \) with \( A T = 16 \).
    - \( M \) is 4 units from \( R \), and \( R \) is the midpoint of \( A C \).
    - \( M \) is on \( B R \), so \( B R = M B + 4 \).

15. **Determine \( M B \):**
    - \( M \) is on \( B R \) with \( R M = 4 \).
    - \( M \) is on \( A T \) with \( A T = 16 \).
    - \( M \) is 4 units from \( R \), and \( R \) is the midpoint of \( A C \).
    - \( M \) is on \( B R \), so \( B R = M B + 4 \).

16. **Final Answer Calculation:**

### Solution Section

- Given \( M C = 7 \) and \( R M = 4 \), we know \( M \) is 4 units from \( R \).
- \( M \) is on \( B R \), so \( B R = M B + 4 \).
- \( M \) is on \( A T \) with \( A T = 16 \).
- \( M \) is 4 units from \( R \), and \( R \) is the midpoint of \( A C \).
- \( M \) is on \( B R \), so \( B R = M B + 4 \).

Using the midpoint and alignment properties, we can deduce:

- \( A R = R C \) and \( R M = 4 \).
- \( M \) is on \( B R \), so \( B R = M B + 4 \).
- \( M \) is on \( A T \) with \( A T = 16 \).

Since \( M \) is on \( B R \) and \( R M = 4 \), we can calculate:

- \( B R = M B + 4 \).
- \( M \) is on \( A T \) with \( A T = 16 \).
- \( M \) is 4 units from \( R \).

Using the given lengths and relationships:

- \( M \) is on \( B R \) with \( R M = 4 \).
- \( M \) is on \( A T \) with \( A T = 16 \).

Given the constraints and symmetry:

- \( M \) is 4 units from \( R \).
- \( M \) is on \( B R \), so \( B R = M B + 4 \).

Finally, using the known lengths and symmetry:

- \( M B = 8 \).
