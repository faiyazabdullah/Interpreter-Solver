**Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints**

- We have two lines \( QC \) and \( Q'C \) with their lengths given: \( |QC| = 5 \) and \( |Q'C| = 15 \).
- Point \( Q \) lies on line \( Q'C \), meaning \( Q \), \( Q' \), and \( C \) are collinear.
- Point \( F \) lies on line \( BC \), but this information is not directly relevant to finding the scale factor between \( Q \) and \( Q' \).

**Step 2: Identify the Goal**

- We need to find the scale factor from point \( Q \) to point \( Q' \). The scale factor, in this context, is the ratio of the distances \( |Q'C| \) to \( |QC| \).

**Step 3: Apply Geometric Concepts**

- Since \( Q \), \( Q' \), and \( C \) are collinear and \( Q \) lies on line \( Q'C \), the scale factor \( k \) is determined by the ratio of the distances from \( C \):
  \[
  k = \frac{|Q'C|}{|QC|}
  \]

**Step 4: Perform Calculations**

- Substitute the given lengths into the formula:
  \[
  k = \frac{15}{5} = 3
  \]

**Step 5: Verify Calculations**

- Reassess the calculation: \( \frac{15}{5} = 3 \) is correct, confirming that the scale factor is indeed 3.

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated scale factor is 3, which corresponds to choice B.

**Step 7: Final Decision**

- Based on the calculations and the given answer choices, the correct choice is B.

**Solution:**

The scale factor from \( Q \) to \( Q' \) is calculated by taking the ratio of the lengths \( |Q'C| \) to \( |QC| \). Given \( |Q'C| = 15 \) and \( |QC| = 5 \), the scale factor is:

\[
k = \frac{15}{5} = 3
\]

Thus, the correct answer is B.

Final Answer: B
