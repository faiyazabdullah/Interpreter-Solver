**Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints**
- We have a parallelogram \(ABCD\).
- We know the following:
  - \(DC = 12\)
  - \(\angle BAD = 115^\circ\)
  - \(BC = 18\)

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**
- We need to find the length of \(AD\).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Properties**
- In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. Therefore, \(AB = CD\) and \(AD = BC\).
- This means \(AD = BC = 18\).

**Step 4: Verify the Calculations**
- Since \(AD\) and \(BC\) are opposite sides of parallelogram \(ABCD\), they must be equal.
- We have calculated \(AD = 18\) based on the property of parallelograms.

**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated length of \(AD\) is 18.
- Among the answer choices:
  - A. 6
  - B. 12
  - C. 18
  - D. 30
- The correct choice is C. 18.

**Step 6: Final Verification**
- Reassess the properties and calculations to ensure no errors.
- The property of a parallelogram was correctly applied, confirming \(AD = 18\).

**Step 7: Conclusion**
- The calculated value matches one of the provided answer choices.

**Solution:**
Based on the properties of a parallelogram, where opposite sides are equal, we determined that \(AD = BC = 18\). This matches one of the provided answer choices. Therefore, the correct answer is:
