1. **Analyze the Given Constraints**:
   - We are given four constraints about the lengths of lines and the perpendicularity between two lines.
   - The lengths of segments BC, AC, and AB are given as \(x\), 10, and 20 respectively.
   - Line CA is perpendicular to line CB.

2. **Summarize Relevant Findings**:
   - Given \( \text{Length of } BC = x = y \), we can infer that \( x = y \).
   - The coordinates or positions of points A, B, and C are not given, but we can use the perpendicular condition to set up a coordinate system.

3. **Apply Geometric Theorems**:
   - Use the Pythagorean theorem because line CA is perpendicular to line CB, forming a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).

4. **Set Up a Coordinate System**:
   - Assume point C is at the origin \((0, 0)\).
   - Assume point A is at \((a, 0)\) on the x-axis since CA is a horizontal line.
   - Assume point B is at \((0, b)\) on the y-axis since CB is a vertical line.

5. **Use the Lengths to Form Equations**:
   - Since \( AC = 10 \), we have \( a = 10 \).
   - Since \( AB = 20 \), using the distance formula: 
     \[
     \sqrt{(a - 0)^2 + (0 - b)^2} = 20
     \]
     \[
     \sqrt{10^2 + b^2} = 20
     \]
     \[
     \sqrt{100 + b^2} = 20
     \]
     \[
     100 + b^2 = 400
     \]
     \[
     b^2 = 300
     \]
     \[
     b = \sqrt{300} = 10\sqrt{3}
     \]

6. **Calculate BC**:
   - Since \( BC = x \) and B is at \((0, b)\), the length of BC is \( b = 10\sqrt{3} \).

7. **Verify and Compare with Answer Choices**:
   - We calculated \( x = 10\sqrt{3} \).
   - Compare this with the given options: A. 5, B. 10, C. \(10\sqrt{3}\), D. 20.
   - The calculated value matches option C.

8. **Reassess**:
   - Double-check all steps, especially the application of the Pythagorean theorem and calculations.
   - The setup and calculations are consistent with the constraints.

9. **Reflect and Conclude**:
   - The calculations align with the geometric constraints and the Pythagorean theorem.
   - The closest match to the calculated value is option C.

**Solution:**

Based on the analysis and calculations, the length \( x \) is determined to be \( 10\sqrt{3} \). This matches option C. Therefore, the correct answer is:
