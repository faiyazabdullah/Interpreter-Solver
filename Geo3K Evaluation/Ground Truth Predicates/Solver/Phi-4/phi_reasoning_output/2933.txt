**Thought Section**

1. **Analyze Given Constraints:**
   - Measure of Angle \( \angle CBF \) is 37 degrees.
   - Measure of \( \angle ABG \) is equal to \( \angle 2 \).
   - Measure of \( \angle GBG \) is equal to \( \angle 1 \).
   - Point \( B \) lies on lines \( AC \), \( DE \), and \( FG \).
   - Line \( BD \) is perpendicular to line \( BC \).

2. **Understand the Configuration:**
   - Given \( \angle CBF = 37^\circ \) and \( BD \perp BC \), we know \( \angle CBD = 90^\circ \).
   - Therefore, \( \angle DBF = 90^\circ - 37^\circ = 53^\circ \).

3. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find \( m \angle 1 \), which is equal to \( \angle GBG \).

4. **Apply Geometric Properties:**
   - Since \( B \) lies on line \( FG \), and \( \angle DBF = 53^\circ \), we need to consider the line \( FG \) in relation to \( BD \) and \( BC \).
   - Since \( \angle GBG = \angle 1 \) and \( \angle GBG \) is part of the triangle \( BGD \), we need to find the relationship between these angles.

5. **Use Perpendicularity:**
   - Since \( BD \perp BC \), \( \angle CBD = 90^\circ \).
   - \( \angle DBF = 53^\circ \) as calculated.

6. **Determine \( \angle GBG \):**
   - Since \( \angle DBF = 53^\circ \) and \( \angle GBG \) is supplementary to \( \angle DBF \) on line \( BD \), we have:
   \[
   \angle GBG = 180^\circ - \angle DBF = 180^\circ - 53^\circ = 127^\circ
   \]
   - However, \( \angle GBG \) is not directly supplementary; instead, it is part of the triangle \( BGD \).

7. **Reassess \( \angle GBG \):**
   - Since \( \angle GBG \) is inside the triangle \( BGD \), and \( \angle DBF = 53^\circ \), we need to consider the angles around point \( B \).
   - \( \angle GBG \) is the angle between \( BG \) and \( BD \), which is complementary to \( \angle DBF \) because \( \angle DBF + \angle GBG = 90^\circ \) (since \( \angle CBD = 90^\circ \)).

8. **Calculate \( \angle GBG \):**
   - Therefore, \( \angle GBG = 90^\circ - 53^\circ = 37^\circ \).

9. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated \( \angle GBG = 37^\circ \) matches answer choice A.

**Solution Section**

Based on the geometric constraints and calculations, the measure of \( \angle 1 \) (which is \( \angle GBG \)) is 37 degrees. This matches answer choice A.
