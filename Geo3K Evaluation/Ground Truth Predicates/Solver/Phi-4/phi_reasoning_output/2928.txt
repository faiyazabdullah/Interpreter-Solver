1. **Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints:**
   - Points C and F lie on specific lines, and line segments have been defined with given properties.
   - Parallel lines and angle measures are mentioned, indicating possible use of properties of parallel lines and angle bisectors.

2. **Identify Key Relationships:**
   - Line segments \( AC \parallel DE \) suggest that corresponding angles are equal.
   - \( BF \) bisects \( \angle ABC \), meaning \( \angle ABF = \angle FBC \).
   - We are given lengths \( BA = 6 \), \( BC = 7.5 \), \( AC = 9 \), and \( DE = 9 \).

3. **Apply Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
   - Since \( BF \) bisects \( \angle ABC \), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
     \[
     \frac{AF}{FC} = \frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{6}{7.5} = \frac{4}{5}
     \]
   - Let \( AF = 4x \) and \( FC = 5x \). Thus, \( AC = AF + FC = 9 \) gives:
     \[
     4x + 5x = 9 \implies 9x = 9 \implies x = 1
     \]
   - Therefore, \( AF = 4 \) and \( FC = 5 \).

4. **Verify and Reassess:**
   - Check if all conditions are satisfied with \( FC = 5 \).
   - \( AC \parallel DE \) and \( AC = DE = 9 \) are consistent.
   - The angle bisector condition and parallel line condition are satisfied.

5. **Reflect and Confirm:**
   - All calculations align with the given constraints.
   - The calculated \( FC = 5 \) matches one of the provided answer choices.

6. **Select the Closest Answer:**
   - The calculated value \( FC = 5 \) matches choice C.

</think>

**Solution:**
Based on the analysis and calculations, the length \( CF \) is determined to be 5. This matches option C.
