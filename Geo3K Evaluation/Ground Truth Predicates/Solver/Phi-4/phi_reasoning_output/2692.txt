**Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints**
- We have three line segments: \( AF \), \( FW \), and \( AW \) with the following lengths:
  - \( AF = 10.5 \)
  - \( FW = 14 \)
  - \( AW = x \) (this is what we need to find)

**Step 2: Identify Geometric Relationships**
- Point \( A \) lies on the line segment \( FW \), meaning \( A \) is somewhere between \( F \) and \( W \).
- We need to determine if \( AF + FW = AW \) holds true or if \( AW = |AF - FW| \) because \( A \) is on \( FW \).

**Step 3: Apply the Segment Addition Postulate**
- Since \( A \) lies on \( FW \), we have two possible scenarios:
  1. \( A \) is between \( F \) and \( W \): \( AF + AW = FW \)
  2. \( F \) is between \( A \) and \( W \): \( AW = AF + FW \)
  3. \( W \) is between \( A \) and \( F \): \( AW = FW - AF \)

**Step 4: Evaluate Each Scenario**
- **Scenario 1**: \( AF + AW = FW \)
  - \( 10.5 + AW = 14 \)
  - \( AW = 14 - 10.5 = 3.5 \)

- **Scenario 2**: \( AW = AF + FW \)
  - \( AW = 10.5 + 14 = 24.5 \)
  - This value is not among the answer choices.

- **Scenario 3**: \( AW = FW - AF \)
  - \( AW = 14 - 10.5 = 3.5 \)

**Step 5: Verify and Choose the Closest Answer**
- From the scenarios, the possible value for \( AW \) is 3.5, which matches answer choice A.
- The other calculated value (24.5) is not among the choices.

**Step 6: Conclusion**
- The only feasible value for \( AW \) that matches one of the given choices is 3.5.

**Solution**

Given the constraints and the geometric relationships, we determined that \( A \) lies on the line segment \( FW \). By evaluating the possible scenarios using the segment addition postulate, we found that the length of \( AW \) is 3.5. This matches answer choice A.
