### Thought Section

**Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Constraints**

- We have several key pieces of information:
  - \( \text{Length of } JK = 6 \)
  - \( \text{Length of } HJ = 4 \)
  - \( \text{Length of } HG = x \)
  - \( H \) lies on the line \( GJ \)
  - \( H, G, \) and \( K \) lie on a circle centered at \( A \) with radius 4.

**Step 2: Visualize the Configuration**

- Points \( H, G, \) and \( K \) are on the circle with radius 4. Therefore, \( AH = AG = AK = 4 \).
- \( H \) lies on the line \( GJ \), which suggests that \( H, G, \) and \( J \) are collinear.

**Step 3: Apply Geometric Properties**

- Since \( H, G, \) and \( J \) are collinear, \( GJ \) is a straight line passing through \( H \).
- The points \( H, G, \) and \( K \) form a triangle inscribed in the circle with \( AH = AG = AK = 4 \).

**Step 4: Use the Power of a Point Theorem**

- Since \( H \) lies on \( GJ \) and \( H, G, \) and \( K \) are on the circle, we can use the Power of a Point theorem:
  \[
  HG \cdot HJ = HK^2
  \]
- We know \( HJ = 4 \) and \( JK = 6 \), so \( KJ = JK = 6 \).

**Step 5: Calculate \( HK \)**

- Since \( H, G, \) and \( K \) are on the circle, and \( AK = 4 \), \( HK \) is a chord of the circle.
- Using the Power of a Point:
  \[
  HG \cdot 4 = HK^2
  \]
- We need to find \( HK \) using the fact that \( K \) is also on the circle:
  \[
  HK = \sqrt{HG \cdot 4}
  \]

**Step 6: Use the Pythagorean Theorem**

- Consider the triangle \( HGK \):
  - \( HG = x \)
  - \( GK = 6 - x \) (since \( GJ = x + 6 \) and \( JK = 6 \))
  - \( HK = \sqrt{HG \cdot HJ} = \sqrt{x \cdot 4} = 2\sqrt{x} \)

- Apply the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle HGK \):
  \[
  HG^2 + GK^2 = HK^2
  \]
  \[
  x^2 + (6-x)^2 = (2\sqrt{x})^2
  \]
  \[
  x^2 + 36 - 12x + x^2 = 4x
  \]
  \[
  2x^2 - 16x + 36 = 0
  \]

**Step 7: Solve the Quadratic Equation**

- Simplify and solve:
  \[
  x^2 - 8x + 18 = 0
  \]
- Use the quadratic formula:
  \[
  x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
  \]
  \[
  x = \frac{8 \pm \sqrt{64 - 72}}{2}
  \]
  \[
  x = \frac{8 \pm \sqrt{-8}}{2}
  \]
- The discriminant is negative, indicating a mistake in assumptions or calculations.

**Step 8: Reassess and Correct**

- Re-evaluate the setup:
  - \( H, G, \) and \( K \) form a right triangle with \( HK \) as the hypotenuse.
  - Use the fact \( HG \cdot HJ = HK^2 \) and \( HK = 4 \) (since \( K \) is on the circle):
  \[
  x \cdot 4 = 16
  \]
  \[
  x = 4
  \]

**Step 9: Verify**

- Check if \( x = 4 \) satisfies all conditions:
  - \( HG = 4 \), \( HJ = 4 \), \( HK = 4 \) (since \( H, G, K \) are on the circle).
  - The Power of a Point is satisfied: \( 4 \cdot 4 = 16 = 4^2 \).

**Step 10: Conclusion**

- The correct value of \( x \) is 4, matching choice B.

</think>

**Solution Section**

- The correct value of \( x \) is 4, based on the geometric constraints and the Power of a Point theorem.
- The calculations confirm that \( HG \cdot HJ = HK^2 \) holds true with \( x = 4 \).
- Therefore, the correct answer is:
