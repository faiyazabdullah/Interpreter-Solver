### Analysis of the Given Geometric Constraints

1. **Angles and Equations:**
   - Measure of \(\angle EAB = 8y + 2\).
   - Measure of \(\angle CBA = 25y - 20\).
   - Measure of \(\angle BAD = 10x\).

2. **Line and Point Relations:**
   - Point \(B\) lies on line \(AF\).
   - Point \(A\) lies on lines \(BH\), \(DE\), and \(FH\).
   - Point \(B\) lies on lines \(FH\) and \(CG\).
   - Line \(BC\) is parallel to line \(AE\).

3. **Objective:**
   - Determine the value of \(y\) given the constraints.

### Summarizing Relevant Findings

- Since lines \(BC\) and \(AE\) are parallel, and considering that points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(E\) are on the lines as described, angles \(\angle EAB\) and \(\angle CBA\) are likely to be consecutive interior angles (or possibly related through alternate interior angles) due to the parallel nature of lines \(BC\) and \(AE\).

### Explorations and Geometric Theorems

- **Consecutive Interior Angles Theorem:**
  If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, the consecutive interior angles are supplementary. Therefore:
  \[
  \angle EAB + \angle CBA = 180^\circ
  \]

- **Substituting the Given Equations:**
  \[
  (8y + 2) + (25y - 20) = 180
  \]

- **Simplifying the Equation:**
  \[
  8y + 2 + 25y - 20 = 180
  \]
  \[
  33y - 18 = 180
  \]
  \[
  33y = 198
  \]
  \[
  y = \frac{198}{33}
  \]
  \[
  y = 6
  \]

### Verification and Reflection

- The calculation of \(y = 6\) satisfies the equation derived from the consecutive interior angles theorem.
- Reassessing the steps confirms no arithmetic errors were made.
- The solution is consistent with the geometric constraints and the properties of parallel lines.

### Final Considerations

- The calculated value \(y = 6\) matches one of the provided answer choices.
- The solution process aligns with the logical deductions based on the given geometric constraints.

**Solution:**

Given the geometric constraints and the application of the consecutive interior angles theorem, the calculation for \(y\) is as follows:

\[
\angle EAB + \angle CBA = 180^\circ
\]

Substituting the given expressions:

\[
(8y + 2) + (25y - 20) = 180
\]

Simplifying:

\[
33y - 18 = 180
\]

\[
33y = 198
\]

\[
y = \frac{198}{33} = 6
\]

Thus, the value of \(y\) is 6, which corresponds to answer choice B.
