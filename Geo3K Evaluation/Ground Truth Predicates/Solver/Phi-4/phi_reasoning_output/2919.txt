1. **Analyze the Problem:**
   - We are given that one diagonal of a rhombus is twice the length of the other diagonal.
   - The area of the rhombus is provided as 169 square millimeters.
   - We need to find the lengths of the diagonals.

2. **Understand the Properties:**
   - A rhombus is a type of quadrilateral where all sides have equal length.
   - The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.
   - The area of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2
     \]
     where \(d_1\) and \(d_2\) are the lengths of the diagonals.

3. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Let the shorter diagonal be \(d_1\) and the longer diagonal be \(d_2\).
   - According to the problem, \(d_2 = 2d_1\).

4. **Apply the Area Formula:**
   - Substitute the given area and the relationship between the diagonals into the area formula:
     \[
     169 = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times 2d_1
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     169 = d_1^2
     \]

5. **Solve for \(d_1\):**
   - Take the square root of both sides:
     \[
     d_1 = \sqrt{169} = 13
     \]

6. **Find \(d_2\):**
   - Since \(d_2 = 2d_1\), calculate:
     \[
     d_2 = 2 \times 13 = 26
     \]

7. **Verify the Calculations:**
   - Check the area with these diagonal lengths:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 13 \times 26 = \frac{1}{2} \times 338 = 169
     \]
   - The calculated area matches the given area, confirming the correctness of the diagonal lengths.

8. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The lengths of the diagonals are 13 and 26.
   - The closest answer choice for the longer diagonal (26) is option C.

</think>

<Solution>
The lengths of the diagonals of the rhombus are 13 mm and 26 mm. The closest answer choice for the longer diagonal is 26 mm, which corresponds to option C.

Final Answer: C
