PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of \( x \) such that lines \( m \) and \( n \) are parallel. The given constraints involve angles and points lying on lines, which suggests the use of angle relationships to determine parallelism.

### Thought

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given two angle measures:
     - \( \text{MeasureOf}(\angle ABD) = 4x - 23 \)
     - \( \text{MeasureOf}(\angle UEC) = 2x + 17 \)
   - Several points lie on specific lines, indicating potential transversals and parallel lines.

2. **Identify Parallel Lines:**
   - To find \( x \) such that lines \( m \) and \( n \) are parallel, we need to use the concept of corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, or consecutive interior angles being equal (or supplementary) when a transversal intersects parallel lines.

3. **Analyze the Given Angles:**
   - The angles \( \angle ABD \) and \( \angle UEC \) might be corresponding or alternate interior angles if lines \( m \) and \( n \) are intersected by a transversal.

4. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - If \( \angle ABD \) and \( \angle UEC \) are corresponding angles, then:
     \[
     4x - 23 = 2x + 17
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     4x - 2x = 17 + 23
     \]
     \[
     2x = 40
     \]
     \[
     x = 20
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if \( x = 20 \) satisfies the condition for parallel lines:
     - Substitute \( x = 20 \) back into the angle expressions:
       - \( \angle ABD = 4(20) - 23 = 80 - 23 = 57 \)
       - \( \angle UEC = 2(20) + 17 = 40 + 17 = 57 \)
     - Since both angles are equal, they are corresponding angles, confirming that lines \( m \) and \( n \) are parallel.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The calculated value \( x = 20 \) makes the angles equal, satisfying the condition for parallel lines.

### Solution

Based on the analysis, the value of \( x \) that makes lines \( m \) and \( n \) parallel is \( x = 20 \).
