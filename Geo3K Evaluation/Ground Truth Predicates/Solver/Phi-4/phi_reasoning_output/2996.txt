1. **Analyze the Given Constraints:**
   - We have a parallelogram \( PQRS \).
   - \( PS = 3 \) (Length of line segment \( PS \) is 3).
   - \( \angle PQR = 128^\circ \) (Measure of angle \( PQR \) is 128 degrees).
   - \( SR = 5 \) (Length of line segment \( SR \) is 5).

2. **Identify What Needs to be Found:**
   - We need to find the length of \( QP \).

3. **Recall Properties of Parallelograms:**
   - Opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal.
   - Opposite angles of a parallelogram are equal.
   - Adjacent angles in a parallelogram are supplementary.

4. **Apply Properties to Given Parallelogram:**
   - Since \( PQRS \) is a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. Therefore, \( PQ = SR \) and \( PS = QR \).
   - From the given constraints, \( SR = 5 \), so \( PQ = 5 \).

5. **Check for Consistency:**
   - We have \( PS = 3 \) and \( QR = 3 \) (since opposite sides are equal).
   - The angle \( \angle PQR = 128^\circ \) does not affect the side lengths directly, but it confirms the internal angle relationships.

6. **Reassess and Reflect:**
   - The calculations and application of parallelogram properties are consistent.
   - No additional geometric relationships or calculations are needed beyond recognizing the equality of opposite sides.

7. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated length of \( QP \) is 5.
   - Check the answer choices: A. 3, B. 5, C. 8, D. 15.
   - The calculated length matches choice B.

8. **Finalize the Answer:**
   - The closest and exact match to our calculation is choice B.
</think>
**Solution:**
Given the properties of a parallelogram, the side \( PQ \) is equal to the opposite side \( SR \), which is 5. Therefore, the length of \( QP \) is 5.

Final Answer: B
