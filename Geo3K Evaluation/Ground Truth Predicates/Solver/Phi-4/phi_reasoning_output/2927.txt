1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**
   - We have two trapezoids: \( JKLM \) and \( QRST \).
   - \( JKLM \sim QRST \), meaning they are similar.
   - Given areas: \( \text{Area of } JKLM = 138 \, \text{sq ft} \), \( \text{Area of } QRST = 5.52 \, \text{sq ft} \).
   - We need to find the length \( x \) where \( \text{Length of } QT = x \).
   - \( KJ = 5 \).

2. **Identify Geometric Relationships:**
   - Since the trapezoids are similar, the ratio of corresponding linear dimensions (such as lengths of sides) is the same.
   - The ratio of areas of similar figures is the square of the ratio of their corresponding linear dimensions.

3. **Apply the Area Ratio:**
   - Let \( r \) be the ratio of the corresponding linear dimensions of trapezoid \( QRST \) to trapezoid \( JKLM \).
   - Then, \( r^2 = \frac{\text{Area of } QRST}{\text{Area of } JKLM} = \frac{5.52}{138} \).

4. **Calculate the Ratio \( r \):**
   \[
   r^2 = \frac{5.52}{138}
   \]
   \[
   r^2 = 0.04
   \]
   \[
   r = \sqrt{0.04} = 0.2
   \]

5. **Find the Corresponding Length \( QT = x \):**
   - Since \( KJ = 5 \) and \( KJ \) corresponds to \( QT \), we have:
   \[
   \frac{QT}{KJ} = r
   \]
   \[
   \frac{x}{5} = 0.2
   \]
   \[
   x = 5 \times 0.2 = 1
   \]

6. **Verify the Calculations:**
   - The calculations are consistent with the properties of similar figures and the given areas.
   - The computed value of \( x = 1 \) matches one of the answer choices.

7. **Select the Correct Answer:**
   - The calculated value of \( x \) is 1, which corresponds to choice B.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The systematic analysis and calculations confirm that the correct choice is B.
</think>

**Solution:**
- Given the similarity and the area ratio, we calculated the linear dimension ratio \( r = 0.2 \).
- Using this ratio, we found the corresponding length \( x = 1 \).
- Therefore, the correct answer is \( x = 1 \).

Final Answer: B
