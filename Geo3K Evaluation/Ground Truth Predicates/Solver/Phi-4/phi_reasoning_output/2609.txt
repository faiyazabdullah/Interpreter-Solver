**Step 1: Analyze the given geometric constraints**

- All points L, K, G, F, N, H, J, and P lie on circles centered at M with radius 2.0.
- Lines are specified: L lies on both Line(M, K) and Line(G, F), N lies on Line(H, J) and Line(M, P).
- Perpendicular lines are specified: Line(L, G) is perpendicular to Line(L, K), and Line(N, P) is perpendicular to Line(N, J).

**Step 2: Understand what is being asked**

- We need to find the measure of the angle \(\widehat{HJ}\) given that \(FL = 24\), \(HJ = 48\), and \(m \widehat{HP} = 65^\circ\).

**Step 3: Apply relevant geometric properties**

- Since \(FL = 24\) and \(HJ = 48\), and all points lie on a circle with center M, we know that these are chord lengths.
- The angle \(\widehat{HP}\) is given as \(65^\circ\). This is an inscribed angle subtending arc HP.
- We need to find \(\widehat{HJ}\), another inscribed angle.

**Step 4: Use properties of circles**

- The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends.
- Therefore, the arc \(HP\) subtended by \(\widehat{HP}\) is \(2 \times 65^\circ = 130^\circ\).
- Since \(H\), \(J\), \(P\), and other points lie on the circle, and given the perpendicular constraints, \(HJ\) and \(HP\) are related through the circle's symmetry.

**Step 5: Calculate the measure of \(\widehat{HJ}\)**

- Since \(HJ\) is a chord and \(\widehat{HP}\) is \(65^\circ\), we need to consider the arc \(HJ\).
- The perpendicularity of \(NP\) to \(NJ\) suggests symmetry, implying \(HJ\) and \(HP\) might subtend arcs that are symmetric around a diameter.
- The arc \(HJ\) can be calculated as the remaining part of the circle after subtracting arc \(HP\) from the semicircle (since \(NP\) is perpendicular to \(NJ\), suggesting a semicircle).
- The arc \(HJ\) is thus \(180^\circ - 130^\circ = 50^\circ\).
- The inscribed angle \(\widehat{HJ}\) is half of the arc \(HJ\), so \(\widehat{HJ} = \frac{50^\circ}{2} = 25^\circ\).

**Step 6: Reassess and refine**

- Given the perpendicularity and symmetry, and considering the circle's properties, the angle \(\widehat{HJ}\) should be complementary to \(\widehat{HP}\) in the semicircle.
- Therefore, \(\widehat{HJ}\) should be \(180^\circ - 65^\circ = 115^\circ\).
- However, considering the circle's symmetry and the perpendicularity, the correct measure should be \(180^\circ - 50^\circ = 130^\circ\).

**Step 7: Compare with answer choices**

- The calculated measure of \(\widehat{HJ}\) is \(130^\circ\).
- This matches option C.

**Solution:**

Based on the analysis of the geometric constraints and properties of the circle, the measure of the angle \(\widehat{HJ}\) is found to be \(130^\circ\). This matches the answer choice C.
