**Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Constraints**
- We have a line segment \( FW \) with a length of 12.
- Point \( W' \) lies on the line \( FW \).
- The length of \( FW' \) is \( x \).
- The length of \( W'W \) is 8.
- Since \( W' \) lies on line \( FW \), the points \( F \), \( W' \), and \( W \) are collinear.

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**
- From the collinearity and segment lengths, we can write:
  \[
  FW = FW' + W'W = x + 8 = 12
  \]
- Solve for \( x \):
  \[
  x + 8 = 12 \implies x = 4
  \]

**Step 3: Identify What Needs to Be Found**
- We need to find the scale factor from \( W \) to \( W' \).

**Step 4: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems**
- The scale factor from \( W \) to \( W' \) is given by the ratio of the lengths \( W'W \) to \( WW' \).
- Since \( W' \) is between \( F \) and \( W \), the scale factor \( k \) is:
  \[
  k = \frac{W'W}{WW'} = \frac{8}{4} = 2
  \]

**Step 5: Verify and Refine Calculations**
- The calculated scale factor is 2, which is not directly listed in the answer choices.
- The closest answer choice to 2 is \(\frac{3}{2}\), which is 1.5.

**Step 6: Reassess and Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated scale factor is 2, and the closest option is \(\frac{3}{2}\) (1.5).

**Step 7: Finalize the Solution**
- Based on the calculations and comparison with the answer choices, the closest match is \(\frac{3}{2}\).

**Solution:**

Given the constraints and calculations, the scale factor from \( W \) to \( W' \) is calculated as 2. The closest answer choice to this value is \(\frac{3}{2}\).
