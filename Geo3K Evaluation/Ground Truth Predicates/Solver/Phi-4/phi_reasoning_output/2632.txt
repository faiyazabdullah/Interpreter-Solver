1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We are given that \(\triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF\). This implies that the triangles are similar, and thus corresponding sides are proportional.
   - \(BG\) is a median of \(\triangle ABC\), and \(EH\) is a median of \(\triangle DEF\).
   - Given lengths: \(BC = 30\), \(BG = 15\), and \(EF = 15\).

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the length of \(EH\).

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
   - Since \(\triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF\), the ratio of corresponding sides is constant. Let this ratio be \(k\).
   - Therefore, \(\frac{BC}{EF} = k\).
   - Substituting the given values: \(\frac{30}{15} = k\), so \(k = 2\).

4. **Use the Property of Medians in Similar Triangles:**
   - In similar triangles, the ratio of the lengths of corresponding medians is the same as the ratio of corresponding sides.
   - Therefore, \(\frac{BG}{EH} = k\).

5. **Calculate \(EH\):**
   - We know \(BG = 15\) and \(k = 2\).
   - Thus, \(\frac{15}{EH} = 2\).
   - Solving for \(EH\), we get \(EH = \frac{15}{2} = 7.5\).

6. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated length of \(EH\) is 7.5.
   - Check the answer choices: A. 7.5, B. 15, C. 22.5, D. 30.
   - The calculated value matches option A.

7. **Verify and Confirm:**
   - All calculations align with the properties of similar triangles and medians.
   - The reasoning is consistent with the given geometric constraints.

</think>

**Solution:**

Given the similarity of the triangles and the properties of medians, we calculated the length of \(EH\) using the ratio of corresponding sides and medians. The calculation showed that \(EH = 7.5\), which matches option A.
