### Thought Process:

1. **Understand the Geometric Configuration:**
   - We have points \(P\), \(Q\), \(R\), and \(S\) with given line segments and lengths.
   - \(PQ = 9\), \(QR = 7\), and \(SR = 7\).
   - \(R\) lies on line \(SQ\), and \(P\) lies on line \(RA\).
   - \(RP\) is perpendicular to \(RQ\).

2. **Visualize the Setup:**
   - Since \(R\) lies on \(SQ\) and \(QR = SR = 7\), \(S\) and \(Q\) are symmetric with respect to \(R\) on line \(SQ\).
   - \(RP \perp RQ\) implies a right triangle \(RQP\).

3. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   - In \(\triangle RQP\), since \(RP \perp RQ\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
     \[
     PQ^2 = PR^2 + QR^2
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     9^2 = PR^2 + 7^2
     \]
     \[
     81 = PR^2 + 49
     \]
     \[
     PR^2 = 32
     \]
     \[
     PR = \sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}
     \]

4. **Determine \(PS\):**
   - Since \(S\) and \(Q\) are symmetric about \(R\) on line \(SQ\), and \(SR = QR = 7\), \(S\) is directly opposite \(Q\) with respect to \(R\).
   - The distance \(PS\) can be found using the right triangle \(\triangle RSP\).
   - Since \(RP\) is perpendicular to \(RQ\), and \(S\) is on the line \(SQ\), \(RS\) is parallel to \(PQ\).
   - Therefore, \(\triangle RSP\) is also a right triangle with \(RS = 7\) and \(RP = 4\sqrt{2}\).

5. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to \(\triangle RSP\):**
   - Use the Pythagorean theorem:
     \[
     PS^2 = PR^2 + RS^2
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     PS^2 = (4\sqrt{2})^2 + 7^2
     \]
     \[
     PS^2 = 32 + 49
     \]
     \[
     PS^2 = 81
     \]
     \[
     PS = \sqrt{81} = 9
     \]

6. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated \(PS = 9\).
   - This matches answer choice B.

</think>

**Solution:**

Given the geometric constraints and applying the Pythagorean theorem to the right triangles formed, we find that the distance \(PS\) is 9. Therefore, the correct answer is:
