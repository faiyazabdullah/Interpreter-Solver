1. **Analyze the Geometric Constraints:**
   - We are given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with the following side lengths:
     - \( BC = 20 \)
     - \( CA = 25 \)
     - \( AB = 15 \)
   - The line \( BC \) is perpendicular to \( BA \), which means \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the value of \( \cos A \) and express it as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
   - Since \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \), \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( BC \) as one leg, \( AB \) as the other leg, and \( CA \) as the hypotenuse.
   - In a right triangle, the cosine of an angle is given by the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse.
   - Here, \( \cos A = \frac{BC}{CA} \).

4. **Calculate \( \cos A \):**
   - Using the given side lengths:
     \[
     \cos A = \frac{BC}{CA} = \frac{20}{25} = \frac{4}{5} = 0.8
     \]

5. **Verify Calculations:**
   - Double-check the calculation:
     - \( \frac{20}{25} = 0.8 \)
   - The calculation is correct.

6. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated value of \( \cos A \) is 0.8.
   - Among the answer choices, 0.8 corresponds to option C.

7. **Reassess and Reflect:**
   - Ensure all steps are logical and consistent with the problem constraints.
   - Confirm that the calculation aligns with the properties of a right triangle and the definition of cosine.

8. **Select the Closest Answer:**
   - The closest answer choice to 0.8 is option C.

**Solution:**
- We calculated \( \cos A \) using the properties of a right triangle:
  \[
  \cos A = \frac{BC}{CA} = \frac{20}{25} = 0.8
  \]
- The closest answer choice to 0.8 is C.

Final Answer: C
