1. **Analyzing the Given Constraints**:
   - We have three line segments: Line(R, T), Line(S, R), and Line(S, T).
   - The lengths of these line segments are given as:
     - Length of Line(R, T) = 3x + 3
     - Length of Line(S, R) = 4x - 4
     - Length of Line(S, T) = 12 + x
   - Additionally, we are given that Length of Line(R, T) = Length of Line(S, R).

2. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - From the equality of Length of Line(R, T) and Length of Line(S, R), we can set up the equation:
     \[
     3x + 3 = 4x - 4
     \]

3. **Solving for x**:
   - Rearrange the equation to solve for x:
     \[
     3x + 3 = 4x - 4
     \]
     \[
     3 + 4 = 4x - 3x
     \]
     \[
     7 = x
     \]

4. **Finding Length of Line(S, T)**:
   - Substitute x = 7 into the expression for Length of Line(S, T):
     \[
     \text{Length of Line(S, T)} = 12 + x = 12 + 7 = 19
     \]

5. **Verification**:
   - Check if the calculated x satisfies the original conditions:
     - Length of Line(R, T) = 3x + 3 = 3(7) + 3 = 21 + 3 = 24
     - Length of Line(S, R) = 4x - 4 = 4(7) - 4 = 28 - 4 = 24
   - Both lengths are equal, confirming that x = 7 is correct.

6. **Comparing with Answer Choices**:
   - The calculated Length of Line(S, T) is 19.
   - Among the answer choices, 19 is option C.

7. **Final Decision**:
   - The calculated result matches exactly with one of the given answer choices.

**Solution**:
- We have determined that the length of Line(S, T) is 19. This matches one of the provided answer choices.
- Therefore, the correct answer is C.
