**Step 1: Analyze the given geometric constraints**

- We have a line segment \( AC \) with length 16.
- We have a line segment \( CD \) with length 23.
- The measure of angle \( \angle BDE \) is 60 degrees.
- Line \( BE \) is perpendicular to line \( DE \).
- Point \( E \) lies on line \( CD \).

**Step 2: Identify what needs to be found**

We need to find the perimeter of a parallelogram. However, the problem does not explicitly state which lines form the parallelogram. We need to determine the correct configuration based on the given information.

**Step 3: Consider possible configurations**

- Since \( E \) lies on \( CD \) and \( BE \) is perpendicular to \( DE \), \( BEDE \) forms a right triangle with \( \angle BDE = 60^\circ \).
- The parallelogram could potentially be \( BCDE \) or \( ACDE \), but since \( E \) is on \( CD \), \( ACDE \) seems more plausible.

**Step 4: Use geometric properties**

- In parallelogram \( ACDE \), opposite sides are equal: \( AC = DE \) and \( CD = AE \).
- We know \( AC = 16 \) and \( CD = 23 \).

**Step 5: Calculate the perimeter**

- The perimeter \( P \) of parallelogram \( ACDE \) is given by:
  \[
  P = 2(AC + CD) = 2(16 + 23) = 2 \times 39 = 78
  \]

**Step 6: Verify calculations and compare with answer choices**

- The calculated perimeter is 78.
- Compare with the given answer choices: A. 32, B. 39, C. 46, D. 78.
- The calculated perimeter matches choice D.

**Step 7: Conclusion**

- The calculations are consistent with the geometric properties and constraints given.
- The closest and exact match to the calculated perimeter is choice D.

**Solution:**

Based on the analysis and calculations, the perimeter of the parallelogram \( ACDE \) is 78. Therefore, the correct answer is:
