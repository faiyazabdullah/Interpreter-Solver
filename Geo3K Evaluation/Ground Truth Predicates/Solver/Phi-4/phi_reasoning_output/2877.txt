1. **Understanding the Problem**: We are given a geometric constraint that the length of line segment GH is 5. We are asked to find the area of a regular polygon, though the type of polygon is not specified. The critical task is to deduce the type of regular polygon based on the given constraint and any implicit assumptions.

2. **Identifying Key Elements**: The constraint gives us one side of the polygon (GH = 5). For a regular polygon, all sides are equal, and all interior angles are equal. The task is to calculate the area of this polygon.

3. **Assumptions and Deductions**:
   - **Possible Polygons**: Common regular polygons include triangles (equilateral), squares, pentagons, hexagons, etc. The number of sides (n) will affect the area formula.
   - **Area Formulas**:
     - Equilateral Triangle: \( A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \)
     - Square: \( A = s^2 \)
     - Regular Pentagon: \( A = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{5(5+2\sqrt{5})} s^2 \)
     - Regular Hexagon: \( A = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2 \)

4. **Calculating Areas**:
   - **Equilateral Triangle**: 
     \[
     A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 5^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 25 \approx 10.825
     \]
   - **Square**: 
     \[
     A = 5^2 = 25
     \]
   - **Regular Pentagon**: 
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{5(5+2\sqrt{5})} \times 25 \approx 43.0119
     \]
   - **Regular Hexagon**: 
     \[
     A = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 25 \approx 64.9519
     \]

5. **Comparison with Answer Choices**:
   - Calculated areas: 10.825 (Triangle), 25 (Square), 43.0119 (Pentagon), 64.9519 (Hexagon).
   - Given answer choices: A. 10.8, B. 21.7, C. 65.0, D. 129.9.
   - Closest match: 64.9519 (Hexagon) is closest to 65.0.

6. **Verification**: The calculation for the hexagon is consistent with the formula for the area of a regular hexagon, confirming that the assumption of a hexagon is reasonable given the problem constraints.

7. **Conclusion**: Based on the calculations and comparisons, the area of the regular polygon with side length 5 that matches the closest to one of the answer choices is that of a regular hexagon.

**Solution**: The closest calculated area to one of the given choices is 64.9519, which rounds to 65.0, corresponding to a regular hexagon with side length 5. Therefore, the correct answer is:
