**Step 1: Analyze the given geometric constraints**

- We have the measures of two angles given: \(\angle HCB = 33^\circ\) and \(\angle BAD = 38^\circ\).
- Points \(A\) and \(C\) lie on specific lines, and lines \(DA\) and \(CH\) are parallel.
- The question involves a figure where \(\angle ABC\) is intersected by parallel lines \(l\) and \(m\).

**Step 2: Summarize relevant findings**

- The parallel lines \(DA\) and \(CH\) indicate that alternate interior angles or corresponding angles may be involved.
- We need to determine the measure of \(\angle ABC\).

**Step 3: Explore geometric properties and relationships**

- Since \(DA \parallel CH\), and \(A\) lies on line \(DA\), \(C\) lies on line \(CH\), any transversal crossing these lines will create alternate interior angles or corresponding angles.
- \(\angle HCB = 33^\circ\) is given, and since \(DA \parallel CH\), \(\angle HCB\) and \(\angle ABC\) could be related through parallel line properties.

**Step 4: Apply relevant geometric theorems**

- Consider the transversal \(BC\) crossing the parallel lines \(DA\) and \(CH\).
- \(\angle HCB\) and \(\angle ABC\) are alternate interior angles due to the parallel lines, so they are equal.

**Step 5: Verify calculations**

- Since \(\angle HCB = 33^\circ\) and \(\angle ABC\) is its alternate interior angle, \(\angle ABC = 33^\circ\).

**Step 6: Reassess and refine**

- Double-check the parallel line properties and the relationship between \(\angle HCB\) and \(\angle ABC\).
- Confirm that no additional information contradicts this conclusion.

**Step 7: Reflect and iterate**

- The logical steps confirm that \(\angle ABC\) is indeed \(33^\circ\) due to the parallel line properties.
- No further calculations or adjustments are needed.

<Solution>

Given the geometric constraints and the properties of parallel lines, we determined that \(\angle ABC\) is equal to \(\angle HCB\) because they are alternate interior angles formed by the transversal \(BC\) crossing the parallel lines \(DA\) and \(CH\). Therefore, the measure of \(\angle ABC\) is \(33^\circ\).

Comparing this with the answer choices, the correct choice is:
