1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have two angles, \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 2\), that form a linear pair. By definition, a linear pair of angles are adjacent angles whose non-common sides form a straight line, meaning their measures add up to \(180^\circ\).
   - We are given that \(m \angle 2 = 67^\circ\).
   - The geometric constraints include that \(\angle(B, C, D)\) is equal to \(\angle 2\) and \(\angle(A, C, B)\) is equal to \(\angle 1\), with the point \(C\) lying on the line \(AD\). These constraints confirm the positions of the angles but do not affect the calculation of their measures directly.

2. **Identify the Objective:**
   - The task is to find the measure of \(\angle 1\).

3. **Apply Geometric Theorems:**
   - Since \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 2\) form a linear pair, we use the property of linear pairs:
     \[
     m \angle 1 + m \angle 2 = 180^\circ
     \]
   - Substitute the given measure of \(\angle 2\):
     \[
     m \angle 1 + 67^\circ = 180^\circ
     \]

4. **Solve for \(m \angle 1\):**
   - Rearrange the equation to solve for \(m \angle 1\):
     \[
     m \angle 1 = 180^\circ - 67^\circ
     \]
   - Calculate the result:
     \[
     m \angle 1 = 113^\circ
     \]

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - The calculation is straightforward and involves basic arithmetic. Subtracting \(67^\circ\) from \(180^\circ\) yields \(113^\circ\).

6. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated measure of \(\angle 1\) is \(113^\circ\).
   - Check the answer choices: A. 67, B. 113, C. 123, D. 133.
   - The correct choice is B. 113.

7. **Final Decision:**
   - The calculated measure matches one of the provided answer choices exactly, so no approximation is necessary.

<Solution>
Based on the given constraints and the property of linear pairs, we determined that the measure of \(\angle 1\) is \(113^\circ\). This matches answer choice B. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
