### Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints

We have the following constraints:

- \( H \) lies on the line \( IG \)
- \( K \) lies on the line \( GJ \)
- Line \( HK \) is parallel to line \( IJ \)

### Step 2: Understand the Given Information

We are given:

- \( GH = 9 \)
- \( GK = 6 \)
- \( KJ = 4 \)

We need to find \( GI \).

### Step 3: Apply Geometric Properties

Since line \( HK \) is parallel to line \( IJ \), and both \( H \) and \( K \) lie on lines that intersect at \( G \), we can infer that triangles \( GHK \) and \( GIJ \) are similar by the Basic Proportionality Theorem (also known as Thales' theorem).

### Step 4: Set Up Proportions from Similar Triangles

From the similarity of triangles \( GHK \) and \( GIJ \), we have:

\[
\frac{GH}{GI} = \frac{GK}{GJ}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate \( GJ \)

Since \( GK = 6 \) and \( KJ = 4 \), we can find \( GJ \):

\[
GJ = GK + KJ = 6 + 4 = 10
\]

### Step 6: Substitute Known Values into the Proportion

Substitute the known values into the proportion:

\[
\frac{9}{GI} = \frac{6}{10}
\]

### Step 7: Solve for \( GI \)

Cross-multiply to solve for \( GI \):

\[
9 \times 10 = 6 \times GI
\]

\[
90 = 6 \times GI
\]

\[
GI = \frac{90}{6} = 15
\]

### Step 8: Compare with Answer Choices

The calculated value of \( GI \) is 15. Comparing this with the answer choices:

- A. 6
- B. 9
- C. 12
- D. 15

The correct choice is D.

**Solution:**

Given the similarity of triangles and the application of the Basic Proportionality Theorem, we calculated \( GI \) to be 15. This matches choice D.

Final Answer: D
