**Step 1: Analyze the given geometric constraints**

- We have the measures of three angles expressed in terms of \(x\):
  - \(\angle R, S, Q = 5x + 4\)
  - \(\angle S, Q, T = 32\)
  - \(\angle R, T, Q = 6x - 2\)

- Points \(R\), \(S\), \(Q\), and \(T\) lie on a circle with center \(C\) and radius 7. This indicates that quadrilateral \(RSTQ\) is a cyclic quadrilateral.

- For a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum to \(180^\circ\).

**Step 2: Identify what needs to be found**

- We need to find \(m \angle S\), which is \(\angle S, Q, T\).

**Step 3: Apply relevant geometric theorems and properties**

- Since \(RSTQ\) is a cyclic quadrilateral, we have:
  \[
  \angle R, S, Q + \angle R, T, Q = 180^\circ
  \]
  Substituting the given expressions:
  \[
  (5x + 4) + (6x - 2) = 180
  \]
  Simplifying:
  \[
  11x + 2 = 180
  \]
  \[
  11x = 178
  \]
  \[
  x = \frac{178}{11} = 16.18
  \]

- Calculate \(\angle R, S, Q\) using \(x = 16.18\):
  \[
  \angle R, S, Q = 5x + 4 = 5(16.18) + 4 = 80.9 + 4 = 84.9
  \]

- Calculate \(\angle R, T, Q\) using \(x = 16.18\):
  \[
  \angle R, T, Q = 6x - 2 = 6(16.18) - 2 = 97.08 - 2 = 95.08
  \]

- Verify the sum of opposite angles:
  \[
  \angle R, S, Q + \angle R, T, Q = 84.9 + 95.08 = 179.98 \approx 180
  \]
  This confirms the calculation is consistent with the cyclic quadrilateral property.

**Step 4: Calculate \(\angle S, Q, T\)**

- We already know \(\angle S, Q, T = 32\) from the given constraints.

**Step 5: Compare with answer choices**

- The calculated value for \(\angle S, Q, T\) is exactly 32, which matches one of the answer choices.

**Step 6: Select the closest answer choice**

- Since the calculated value matches exactly with one of the choices, we select \(C. 32\).

**Step 7: Conclude with the final answer**

- Final Answer: C

**Solution**

Given the constraints and the properties of a cyclic quadrilateral, we calculated the value of \(x\) and verified the angles. The measure of \(\angle S, Q, T\) was directly given as 32, which matches one of the answer choices. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: C
