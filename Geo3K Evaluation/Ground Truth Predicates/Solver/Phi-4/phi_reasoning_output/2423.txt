**Step 1: Understand the Given Information**

We are given the following constraints:
- \( AC = x - 3 \)
- \( BC = 4x - 21 \)
- \( AB = 2x - 7 \)

We need to find the length of \( AB \) given that \(\triangle ABC\) is isosceles with \( AB \cong BC \).

**Step 2: Identify the Condition for Isosceles Triangle**

Since \(\triangle ABC\) is isosceles with \( AB \cong BC \), we equate the lengths of \( AB \) and \( BC \):

\[ 2x - 7 = 4x - 21 \]

**Step 3: Solve the Equation**

Rearrange the equation to solve for \( x \):

\[
2x - 7 = 4x - 21
\]

Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:

\[
-7 = 2x - 21
\]

Add 21 to both sides:

\[
14 = 2x
\]

Divide by 2:

\[
x = 7
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the Length of \( AB \)**

Substitute \( x = 7 \) into the expression for \( AB \):

\[
AB = 2x - 7 = 2(7) - 7 = 14 - 7 = 7
\]

**Step 5: Verify the Solution**

Check if \( AB = BC \) with \( x = 7 \):

- \( AB = 7 \)
- \( BC = 4x - 21 = 4(7) - 21 = 28 - 21 = 7 \)

Both \( AB \) and \( BC \) are equal, confirming the isosceles condition.

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**

The calculated length of \( AB \) is 7, which matches choice C.

**Step 7: Conclusion**

The solution is consistent with the problem's constraints and conditions. Therefore, the correct answer is C.

</think>

**Solution:**

By solving the equation \( 2x - 7 = 4x - 21 \), we found \( x = 7 \). Substituting \( x = 7 \) into the expression for \( AB \), we get \( AB = 7 \). This satisfies the condition \( AB \cong BC \) for the isosceles triangle. Thus, the length of \( AB \) is 7, which corresponds to choice C.

Final Answer: C
