1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a circle \(\odot M\) with center \(M\) and radius \(2.0\).
   - Points \(F, L, G, K, H, J, P\) lie on this circle.
   - We are given that \(FL = 24\), \(HJ = 48\), and \(\angle HPM = 65^\circ\).
   - We need to find the length of \(FG\).

2. **Analyzing Geometric Constraints:**
   - \(L\) and \(K\) lie on the same line through \(M\), and \(L\) and \(G\) lie on another line through \(M\). The lines \(LG\) and \(LK\) are perpendicular.
   - \(N\) is on lines \(HJ\) and \(MP\), and lines \(NP\) and \(NJ\) are perpendicular.
   - Points \(F, L, G, K, H, J, P\) are on the circle \(\odot M\).

3. **Using Circle Properties:**
   - Since all points lie on the circle \(\odot M\), they are equidistant from \(M\).
   - The perpendicularity conditions suggest that \(L\) and \(K\) are endpoints of a diameter, as are \(N, P\) and \(N, J\).

4. **Exploring Given Lengths:**
   - \(FL = 24\) and \(HJ = 48\) are chords of the circle.
   - The angle \(\angle HPM = 65^\circ\) is given, which might help in determining arc lengths or chord lengths.

5. **Using Perpendicularity:**
   - Since \(LG \perp LK\), \(LG\) and \(LK\) are likely to be radii or segments that form a right triangle with the diameter.
   - Similarly, \(NP \perp NJ\) suggests \(NP\) and \(NJ\) are radii or segments forming a right triangle.

6. **Finding \(FG\):**
   - Since \(L\) and \(K\) are endpoints of a diameter, \(LK\) is a diameter of the circle.
   - \(FL = 24\) implies \(L\) is on the circle, and \(F\) is another point on the circle.
   - \(LG \perp LK\) implies \(G\) is on the circle such that \(LG\) is a radius perpendicular to the diameter \(LK\).

7. **Calculating \(FG\):**
   - Since \(LG\) is perpendicular to \(LK\) and both are radii, \(LG\) is also a radius of the circle.
   - The circle's radius is \(2.0\), so \(LG = 2.0\).
   - \(FL = 24\) is a chord, and \(G\) is on the circle such that \(LG\) is perpendicular to \(LK\).
   - Using the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle FLG\), where \(LF\) is the hypotenuse:
     \[
     FL^2 = FG^2 + LG^2
     \]
     \[
     24^2 = FG^2 + 2.0^2
     \]
     \[
     576 = FG^2 + 4
     \]
     \[
     FG^2 = 572
     \]
     \[
     FG = \sqrt{572} \approx 23.91
     \]

8. **Choosing the Closest Answer:**
   - The closest answer choice to \(23.91\) is \(24\).

9. **Verification:**
   - Reassess the constraints and calculations to ensure no errors.
   - The setup and calculations align with the geometric properties and given data.

</think>

**Solution:**

Based on the analysis and calculations, the length of \(FG\) is approximately \(23.91\), which is closest to the answer choice \(24\).
