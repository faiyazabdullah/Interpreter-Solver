1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We are given two angles: \(\angle DCE = 5x - 12\) and \(\angle DEC = 3x\).
   - Point \(B\) lies on line \(EC\).
   - Points \(E\), \(C\), and \(D\) lie on a circle centered at \(B\) with radius \(2.0\).

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the value of \(x\).

3. **Apply Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
   - Since \(E\), \(C\), and \(D\) lie on the circle with center \(B\), triangle \(ECD\) is inscribed in the circle.
   - The sum of angles in triangle \(ECD\) is \(180^\circ\).

4. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The angles in triangle \(ECD\) are \(\angle DCE\), \(\angle DEC\), and \(\angle CED\).
   - Therefore, we have:
     \[
     \angle DCE + \angle DEC + \angle CED = 180^\circ
     \]
   - Substitute the given expressions:
     \[
     (5x - 12) + 3x + \angle CED = 180
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     8x - 12 + \angle CED = 180
     \]
   - Solve for \(\angle CED\):
     \[
     \angle CED = 180 - 8x + 12 = 192 - 8x
     \]

5. **Consider the Circle Properties:**
   - Since \(B\) is the center of the circle and \(E\), \(C\), and \(D\) are on the circle, \(BE = BC = BD = 2.0\).
   - \(B\) lies on line \(EC\), implying \(BE\) and \(BC\) are collinear, making \(\angle EBC = 0^\circ\) or \(180^\circ\).

6. **Use the Inscribed Angle Theorem:**
   - The angle subtended by arc \(ED\) at the center \(B\) is twice the angle subtended at any point on the circle, i.e., \(\angle EBD = 2 \times \angle ECD\).
   - Since \(B\) is the center, \(\angle EBD = 180^\circ - \angle ECD\).

7. **Calculate Using Known Angles:**
   - \(\angle ECD = \angle DCE = 5x - 12\).
   - \(\angle EBD = 180^\circ - (5x - 12)\).

8. **Reassess the Equation:**
   - From the circle properties and inscribed angles:
     \[
     \angle EBD = 2 \times \angle ECD
     \]
   - Substitute:
     \[
     180 - (5x - 12) = 2(5x - 12)
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     180 - 5x + 12 = 10x - 24
     \]
     \[
     192 - 5x = 10x - 24
     \]
     \[
     192 + 24 = 10x + 5x
     \]
     \[
     216 = 15x
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{216}{15} = 14.4
     \]

9. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated \(x = 14.4\).
   - Compare with the given choices: \(10.25\), \(12.75\), \(18.75\), \(25.5\).
   - The closest value to \(14.4\) is \(12.75\).

10. **Select the Closest Answer:**
    - Based on the calculations and comparison, the closest answer choice is \(12.75\).

</think>

**Solution:**

By analyzing the geometric constraints and applying relevant theorems, we calculated \(x = 14.4\). Comparing this with the provided answer choices, the closest value is \(12.75\).
