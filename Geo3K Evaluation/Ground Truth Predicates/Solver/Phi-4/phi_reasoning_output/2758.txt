1. **Analyzing the Given Information**: 
   - We have a trapezoid \(GHJK\) with two parallel sides \(GK\) and \(HJ\).
   - The length of \(KJ\) is given as 13 units.
   - The length of \(GH\) is given as 17 units.
   - The area of the trapezoid is given as 75 square meters.

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found**: 
   - We need to find the height of the trapezoid.

3. **Relevant Geometric Formula**: 
   - The area \(A\) of a trapezoid can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times (b_1 + b_2) \times h
     \]
     where \(b_1\) and \(b_2\) are the lengths of the parallel sides (bases), and \(h\) is the height.

4. **Applying the Formula**:
   - Here, \(b_1 = GH = 17\) and \(b_2 = KJ = 13\).
   - The area \(A = 75\).
   - Substitute these into the area formula:
     \[
     75 = \frac{1}{2} \times (17 + 13) \times h
     \]
     \[
     75 = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 \times h
     \]
     \[
     75 = 15h
     \]

5. **Solving for \(h\)**:
   - Rearrange the equation to solve for \(h\):
     \[
     h = \frac{75}{15}
     \]
     \[
     h = 5
     \]

6. **Verification**:
   - Double-check the calculations: \(15 \times 5 = 75\), which matches the given area.

7. **Selecting the Closest Answer Choice**:
   - The calculated height is 5, which matches option C.

8. **Reflection**:
   - Reassess the steps to ensure no errors were made in the application of formulas or arithmetic.
   - The logical flow from the area formula to solving for \(h\) is consistent and accurate.

**Solution:**
To find the height of trapezoid \(GHJK\), we used the trapezoid area formula:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times (b_1 + b_2) \times h
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
75 = \frac{1}{2} \times (17 + 13) \times h
\]
\[
75 = 15h
\]
Solving for \(h\):
\[
h = \frac{75}{15} = 5
\]
Thus, the height of the trapezoid is 5 meters.
