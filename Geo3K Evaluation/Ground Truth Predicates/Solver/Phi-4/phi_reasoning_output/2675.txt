**Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints**
- We have a circle centered at \( E \) with radius 4.0.
- Points \( D \) and \( F \) lie on this circle, meaning \( DE = DF = 4.0 \).
- \( \text{Arc}(D, F) \) has a measure of 102 degrees.
- \( \angle DFC \) is equal to \( \angle 1 \).
- Point \( D \) lies on line \( \overline{FB} \).
- The line \( \overline{FB} \) is tangent to the circle at \( F \).

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**
- We need to find the measure of \( \angle 1 \).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems**
- The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. Here, \( \angle DFC \) is an inscribed angle intercepting arc \( \text{Arc}(D, F) \).
- The measure of an inscribed angle is given by:
  \[
  \text{Measure of } \angle DFC = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Measure of Arc}(D, F)
  \]
- Substituting the given arc measure:
  \[
  \text{Measure of } \angle DFC = \frac{1}{2} \times 102 = 51 \text{ degrees}
  \]

**Step 4: Verify Tangency Condition**
- Since \( \overline{FB} \) is tangent at \( F \), and \( \overline{FD} \) is a radius, \( \angle DFC \) is indeed the angle between the tangent and the chord, confirming that \( \angle DFC \) is an inscribed angle.

**Step 5: Reflect on the Solution**
- We have verified that the conditions are met for using the inscribed angle theorem.
- All calculations align with the given constraints and geometric properties.

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated measure of \( \angle 1 \) is 51 degrees.
- The closest answer choice is A. 51.

**Step 7: Finalize the Answer**
- Based on the calculations and verification, the correct answer choice is A.

**Solution:**
Given the constraints and using the inscribed angle theorem, we calculated the measure of \( \angle 1 \) as 51 degrees. This matches answer choice A.
