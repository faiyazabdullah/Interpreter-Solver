1. **Analyzing the Given Constraints:**
   - We have several angle measures involving points A, B, C, and D.
   - Specifically, we are given:
     - Measure of angle ∠CDA = 38°
     - Measure of angle ∠DCB = Measure of angle 1
     - Measure of angle ∠ACB = Measure of angle 3
     - Measure of angle ∠CBA = 72°
     - Measure of angle ∠DAC = 42°
     - Measure of angle ∠BCD = Measure of angle 2
     - Point B lies on line AD.

2. **Identifying the Objective:**
   - We need to find the measure of angle ∠3, which is the same as angle ∠ACB.

3. **Understanding the Geometry:**
   - Since B lies on line AD, A, B, and D are collinear.
   - We are dealing with a quadrilateral (possibly a cyclic quadrilateral) involving points A, B, C, and D.

4. **Using Angle Sum Properties:**
   - In triangle ∆ACD, the sum of angles is 180°:
     - ∠CDA + ∠DAC + ∠ACD = 180°
     - 38° + 42° + ∠ACD = 180°
     - ∠ACD = 180° - 80° = 100°

5. **Analyzing Triangle ∆ABC:**
   - The sum of angles in triangle ∆ABC is also 180°:
     - ∠ACB + ∠CBA + ∠BAC = 180°
     - ∠3 + 72° + ∠BAC = 180°
     - ∠3 + ∠BAC = 108°

6. **Analyzing Quadrilateral ABCD:**
   - Since B is on line AD, consider quadrilateral ABCD:
   - The sum of angles in a quadrilateral is 360°:
     - ∠CDA + ∠DCB + ∠BCD + ∠CBA = 360°
     - 38° + ∠1 + ∠2 + 72° = 360°
     - ∠1 + ∠2 = 360° - 110° = 250°

7. **Using Cyclic Quadrilateral Properties:**
   - If ABCD is cyclic, opposite angles sum to 180°:
     - ∠CDA + ∠CBA = 180° (38° + 72° = 110°, not 180°, so not cyclic)
     - Check other pairs:
     - ∠DAC + ∠DCB = 180° (42° + ∠1 = 180°)
     - ∠1 = 138°

8. **Finding ∠2:**
   - From ∠1 + ∠2 = 250°:
     - 138° + ∠2 = 250°
     - ∠2 = 112°

9. **Finding ∠BAC:**
   - In triangle ∆ABD (since B is on AD):
     - ∠BAC + ∠DAC + ∠ACD = 180°
     - ∠BAC + 42° + 100° = 180°
     - ∠BAC = 180° - 142° = 38°

10. **Calculating ∠3:**
    - From ∠3 + ∠BAC = 108°:
      - ∠3 + 38° = 108°
      - ∠3 = 108° - 38° = 70°

11. **Comparing with Answer Choices:**
    - The closest answer choice to 70° is 72°.

<Solution>
Based on the calculations and analysis, the measure of angle ∠3 is closest to 72°. Therefore, the correct answer is:
