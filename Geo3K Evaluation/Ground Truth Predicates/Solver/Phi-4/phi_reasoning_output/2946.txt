**Step 1: Analyze the given geometric constraints.**

- We have a kite \(FGHJ\) with the following properties:
  - \( \angle HGF = 128^\circ \)
  - \( \angle FHJ = 72^\circ \)
  - \( GF = GH \) (since \(FGHJ\) is a kite, adjacent sides are equal)
  - \( HJ = JF \) (since \(FGHJ\) is a kite, the other pair of adjacent sides are equal)

**Step 2: Summarize relevant findings.**

- In a kite, two pairs of adjacent sides are equal.
- The angles between unequal sides are equal, i.e., \( \angle GFH = \angle GHJ \).
- The diagonals of a kite are perpendicular, and one of the diagonals bisects the other.

**Step 3: Identify what needs to be found.**

- We need to find \( m \angle GFJ \).

**Step 4: Apply relevant geometric properties.**

- Since \(GF = GH\) and \(HJ = JF\), \(FGHJ\) is symmetric along the line \(FH\).
- The angles \( \angle GFH \) and \( \angle GHJ \) are equal because they are between the unequal sides of the kite.
- The sum of angles around point \(F\) is \(360^\circ\).

**Step 5: Calculate \( \angle GFH \) and \( \angle GHJ \).**

- In \(\triangle GHF\), the sum of angles is \(180^\circ\).
- We know \( \angle HGF = 128^\circ \) and \( \angle FHJ = 72^\circ \).
- Therefore, \( \angle GFH + \angle GHF = 180^\circ - 128^\circ = 52^\circ \).
- Since \( \angle GFH = \angle GHJ \), we have \( 2 \times \angle GFH = 52^\circ \).
- Thus, \( \angle GFH = 26^\circ \).

**Step 6: Calculate \( \angle GFJ \).**

- In \(\triangle GFJ\), the sum of angles is \(180^\circ\).
- We have \( \angle GFH = 26^\circ \) and \( \angle FHJ = 72^\circ \).
- Therefore, \( \angle GFJ = 180^\circ - 26^\circ - 72^\circ = 82^\circ \).

**Step 7: Compare with answer choices.**

- The calculated \( \angle GFJ = 82^\circ \).
- The closest answer choice is \(80^\circ\).

**Step 8: Reassess and finalize.**

- Given the constraints and calculations, \( \angle GFJ \) should be as close as possible to one of the provided options.
- The closest option to \(82^\circ\) is \(80^\circ\).

**Solution:**

Given the calculations and the properties of the kite, the measure of \( \angle GFJ \) is closest to \(80^\circ\). Therefore, the correct answer is:
