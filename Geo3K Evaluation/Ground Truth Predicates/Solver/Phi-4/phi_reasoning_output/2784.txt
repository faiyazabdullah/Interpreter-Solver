<think>
1. **Analyze the Given Constraints:**
   - We have the lengths of some segments: \( AD = 9 \), \( CE = 6 \).
   - Points \( D \) and \( E \) lie on a circle centered at \( A \) with radius \( r \) (denoted as \( radius_{0,0} \)).
   - Point \( E \) lies on the line \( AC \).

2. **Identify the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length \( CD = x \).

3. **Visualize the Geometry:**
   - Since \( D \) and \( E \) lie on the circle centered at \( A \), \( AD = AE = r \).
   - Given \( AD = 9 \), we have \( r = 9 \).
   - Therefore, \( AE = 9 \).

4. **Apply Geometric Properties:**
   - Since \( E \) lies on line \( AC \) and \( AE = 9 \), \( E \) is on the line extending from \( A \) through \( C \).
   - The length \( CE = 6 \) implies that \( C \) is 6 units away from \( E \) along line \( AC \).

5. **Consider the Position of Points:**
   - Since \( E \) is on line \( AC \) and \( AE = 9 \), \( C \) must be either 6 units to the left or right of \( E \) along line \( AC \).
   - If \( C \) is to the right of \( E \), then \( AC = AE + CE = 9 + 6 = 15 \).
   - If \( C \) is to the left of \( E \), then \( AC = AE - CE = 9 - 6 = 3 \).

6. **Use the Circle Constraint:**
   - Since \( D \) is on the circle centered at \( A \) with radius 9, and \( AD = 9 \), \( D \) is on the circle.
   - We need to find \( CD = x \).

7. **Apply the Power of a Point Theorem:**
   - Since \( E \) lies on line \( AC \) and \( D \) lies on the circle, and segments appear tangent, we can use the Power of a Point theorem.
   - The power of point \( C \) with respect to the circle is \( CE \cdot CA = CD^2 \).

8. **Calculate Using Power of a Point:**
   - If \( AC = 15 \) (since \( C \) is to the right of \( E \)), then:
     \[
     CE \cdot CA = 6 \cdot 15 = 90
     \]
     \[
     CD^2 = 90 \implies CD = \sqrt{90} = 3\sqrt{10}
     \]

9. **Consider the Closest Answer:**
   - Calculate \( \sqrt{90} \approx 9.49 \).
   - The closest integer to \( 9.49 \) is 9.

10. **Reassess the Calculation:**
    - If \( AC = 3 \) (if \( C \) were to the left of \( E \)), then:
      \[
      CE \cdot CA = 6 \cdot 3 = 18
      \]
      \[
      CD^2 = 18 \implies CD = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2} \approx 4.24
      \]
    - This does not match any answer choices closely.

11. **Finalize the Solution:**
    - The calculation with \( AC = 15 \) gives \( CD \approx 9.49 \), closest to 9.
    - Therefore, the correct choice is \( x = 9 \).

</think>

<Solution>
Based on the analysis and calculations, the length \( CD \) is closest to 9. Therefore, the correct answer is:
