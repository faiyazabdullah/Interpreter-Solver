### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- We are given a trapezoid \( TRSV \) with points \( M \) and \( N \) as midpoints of the legs \( TS \) and \( RV \), respectively.
- We know \( TR = 32 \) and \( MN = 25 \).
- We need to find the length of \( VS \).

### Step 2: Identify Relevant Geometric Theorems
- The line segment connecting the midpoints of the non-parallel sides (legs) of a trapezoid is called the midsegment.
- The length of the midsegment in a trapezoid is the average of the lengths of the two bases.

### Step 3: Apply the Midsegment Theorem
- Let \( TR \) and \( VS \) be the two parallel sides (bases) of the trapezoid.
- According to the midsegment theorem for trapezoids:
  \[
  MN = \frac{TR + VS}{2}
  \]
- We know \( MN = 25 \) and \( TR = 32 \).

### Step 4: Set Up the Equation
- Substitute the known values into the midsegment formula:
  \[
  25 = \frac{32 + VS}{2}
  \]

### Step 5: Solve for \( VS \)
- Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
  \[
  50 = 32 + VS
  \]
- Subtract 32 from both sides to solve for \( VS \):
  \[
  VS = 50 - 32 = 18
  \]

### Step 6: Verify the Calculation
- Recalculate to ensure accuracy:
  \[
  25 = \frac{32 + 18}{2} \implies 25 = \frac{50}{2} \implies 25 = 25
  \]
- The calculation confirms that \( VS = 18 \).

### Step 7: Compare with Answer Choices
- The calculated value for \( VS \) is 18, which matches choice A.

### Step 8: Conclusion
- The calculations are consistent with the given conditions and theorems.
- The closest answer choice is A.

**Solution:**

Based on the midsegment theorem for trapezoids, we calculated the length of \( VS \) using the given lengths of \( TR \) and \( MN \). The calculations confirmed that \( VS = 18 \), which matches answer choice A.
