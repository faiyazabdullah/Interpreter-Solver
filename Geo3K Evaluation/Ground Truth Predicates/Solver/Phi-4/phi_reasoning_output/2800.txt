1. **Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints:**
   - We have several pieces of information:
     - Length of \( LN = 36 \)
     - Length of \( AL = 27 \)
     - Length of \( AB = 40 \)
     - Point \( L \) lies on line \( BL \)
     - Line \( NL \) is perpendicular to line \( LA \)

2. **Visualize and Summarize the Problem:**
   - From the perpendicularity \( NL \perp LA \), we infer that \( \triangle ALN \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ALN = 90^\circ \).
   - We know \( AL = 27 \) and \( LN = 36 \).
   - To find the area of the parallelogram, we need to determine the base and the height. Given the perpendicularity, \( AL \) can serve as the height if \( LN \) is the base, or vice versa.

3. **Calculate Missing Side Using Pythagorean Theorem:**
   - Since \( \triangle ALN \) is a right triangle, use the Pythagorean theorem to find \( AN \):
     \[
     AN = \sqrt{AL^2 + LN^2} = \sqrt{27^2 + 36^2} = \sqrt{729 + 1296} = \sqrt{2025} = 45
     \]

4. **Determine the Parallelogram's Dimensions:**
   - The line \( AB \) is given as 40, and since \( A \) lies on line \( BL \), it suggests \( AB \) is parallel to \( LN \) (or \( NL \) is parallel to \( AB \)), forming a parallelogram \( ALNB \).
   - In parallelogram \( ALNB \), \( AL \) and \( NB \) are heights, and \( AB \) and \( LN \) are bases.

5. **Calculate the Area of the Parallelogram:**
   - The area of a parallelogram is given by the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]
   - Using \( AB = 40 \) as the base and \( AL = 27 \) as the height:
     \[
     \text{Area} = AB \times AL = 40 \times 27 = 1080
     \]

6. **Verify and Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated area is 1080, which matches one of the provided answer choices.
   - No further adjustments or recalculations are needed as the calculation aligns perfectly with one of the options.

7. **Finalize the Answer:**
   - The closest and exact match to our calculated area is choice B.

**Solution:**
Based on the analysis and calculations, the area of the parallelogram is 1080. Therefore, the correct answer is:
