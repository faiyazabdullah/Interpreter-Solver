**Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints**

We have several geometric constraints involving points, angles, and lines. Key points include:

- Points J, C, I, N, O, K, F, G, B, H, M, and E are involved.
- Several lines and angles are defined with specific relationships, such as parallel lines and points lying on lines.

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to be Found**

We need to find the measure of \(\angle 1\), which is defined as \(\angle N, C, J\).

**Step 3: Extract Given Angle Measures**

- \(m \angle 11 = 62\)
- \(m \angle 14 = 38\)

**Step 4: Analyze Relationships and Apply Geometric Theorems**

- \(\angle 11\) is defined as \(\angle G, K, M\).
- \(\angle 14\) is defined as \(\angle H, B, F\).
- Line \(N, O\) is parallel to line \(M, H\).

**Step 5: Use Parallel Line Properties**

Since \(Line(N, O)\) is parallel to \(Line(M, H)\), and considering the transversal \(Line(B, M)\), we can use the properties of parallel lines:

- Alternate interior angles are equal.
- Corresponding angles are equal.

**Step 6: Determine Relationships Involving \(\angle 1\)**

- \(\angle 1 = \angle N, C, J\)
- \(\angle 11 = \angle G, K, M = 62\)
- \(\angle 14 = \angle H, B, F = 38\)

**Step 7: Analyze the Triangle and Angle Sum Property**

Consider the triangle formed by points \(N, C, J\):

- The sum of angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\).
- We need to find \(\angle N, C, J\) (\(\angle 1\)).

**Step 8: Use Given Angles and Parallel Line Properties**

- Since \(\angle 11 = 62\) and \(\angle 14 = 38\), and considering the parallel lines and transversals, we can infer relationships between these angles and others in the figure.

**Step 9: Calculate \(\angle 1\)**

- \(\angle 11\) and \(\angle 14\) are part of the larger geometric configuration.
- Using the parallel line property, \(\angle 11\) and \(\angle 14\) can help us find \(\angle 1\).

Given the parallel lines and transversal properties, we can deduce:

- \(\angle 1\) is related to \(\angle 11\) and \(\angle 14\) through the geometry of the figure.

**Step 10: Calculate Using Angle Relationships**

- Since \(\angle 11 = 62\) and \(\angle 14 = 38\), and considering the parallel lines, \(\angle 1\) can be calculated using the relationships and the angle sum property.

- \(\angle 1 = 180^\circ - (\angle 11 + \angle 14)\)
- \(\angle 1 = 180^\circ - (62 + 38)\)
- \(\angle 1 = 180^\circ - 100^\circ\)
- \(\angle 1 = 80^\circ\)

**Step 11: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated measure of \(\angle 1\) is \(80^\circ\).

**Final Step: Select the Closest Answer Choice**

- The closest answer choice to \(80^\circ\) is \(D. 80\).

Final Answer: D
