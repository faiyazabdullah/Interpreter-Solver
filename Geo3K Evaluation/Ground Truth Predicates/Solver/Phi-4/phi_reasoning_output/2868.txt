1. **Analyzing the Given Constraints:**
   - We have several line segments and points, with their lengths specified: \( AD = 4 \), \( BE = 12 \), and \( EC = 5 \).
   - We need to find the length \( AB = x \).
   - Points \( A \) and \( E \) lie on lines \( BD \) and \( BC \) respectively.
   - Line \( DC \) is parallel to line \( AE \).

2. **Summarizing the Geometric Setup:**
   - Since \( DC \parallel AE \), triangles \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle EBC \) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion, as they share angle \( \angle ABD = \angle EBC \) and have corresponding parallel lines \( DC \parallel AE \).

3. **Exploring Similarity Relations:**
   - From the similarity \( \triangle ABD \sim \triangle EBC \), we have the proportionality of corresponding sides:
     \[
     \frac{AB}{BE} = \frac{AD}{EC} = \frac{BD}{BC}
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     \frac{x}{12} = \frac{4}{5}
     \]

4. **Solving for \( x \):**
   - Cross-multiply to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     5x = 48
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 5:
     \[
     x = \frac{48}{5} = 9.6
     \]

5. **Verification and Reflection:**
   - The calculated value of \( x = 9.6 \) matches one of the given answer choices.
   - Reassess the setup and calculations to ensure no errors were made. The similarity and proportionality were correctly applied, and calculations were straightforward.

6. **Revisiting and Conclusion:**
   - The calculations and geometric reasoning are consistent with the problem constraints and similarity conditions.
   - No further adjustments or corrections are necessary.
