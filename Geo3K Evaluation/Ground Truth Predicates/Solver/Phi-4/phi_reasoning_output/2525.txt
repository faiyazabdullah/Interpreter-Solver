### Thought Section

1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with the following constraints:
     - \( |CA| = 7 \)
     - \( |AB| = 3x \)
     - Points \( C \) and \( A \) both lie on a circle centered at \( E \) with a radius of 3.0.
     - The perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is 25.
     - We need to find the value of \( x \).

2. **Summarize Relevant Findings:**
   - The perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is given by the sum of its sides: \( |CA| + |AB| + |BC| = 25 \).
   - Substituting the known values: \( 7 + 3x + |BC| = 25 \).

3. **Explore the Geometry:**
   - Since \( C \) and \( A \) lie on the circle centered at \( E \) with radius 3, \( |CE| = |AE| = 3 \).
   - \( |CA| = 7 \) suggests that \( C \) and \( A \) are not diametrically opposite on the circle, as the diameter would be 6.
   - The segments \( CA \) and \( AB \) are not necessarily tangents, but we need to consider the possibility of tangency for \( BC \).

4. **Apply Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
   - From the perimeter equation: \( 7 + 3x + |BC| = 25 \), we can solve for \( |BC| \):
     \[
     |BC| = 25 - 7 - 3x = 18 - 3x
     \]

5. **Verify and Refine Calculations:**
   - Check if \( |BC| \) can be a tangent to the circle at \( A \) or \( C \). However, without loss of generality, assume no specific tangency unless needed.
   - Since \( |BC| \) must be positive, \( 18 - 3x > 0 \) implies \( x < 6 \).

6. **Reassess and Reflect:**
   - We need to find \( x \) such that the perimeter condition holds and all side lengths are positive.
   - Substitute possible values for \( x \) from the answer choices and check:
     - \( x = 3 \): \( |AB| = 9 \), \( |BC| = 18 - 9 = 9 \). Perimeter: \( 7 + 9 + 9 = 25 \).
     - \( x = 6 \): \( |AB| = 18 \), \( |BC| = 18 - 18 = 0 \) (not possible).
     - \( x = 7 \): \( |AB| = 21 \), \( |BC| = 18 - 21 = -3 \) (not possible).
     - \( x = 9 \): \( |AB| = 27 \), \( |BC| = 18 - 27 = -9 \) (not possible).

7. **Backtrace and Iterate:**
   - The only value that satisfies all conditions is \( x = 3 \).

<Solution>

### Solution Section

Given the constraints and calculations:

- We found that the only value of \( x \) that satisfies the perimeter condition \( 7 + 3x + |BC| = 25 \) with all side lengths positive is \( x = 3 \).
- Substituting \( x = 3 \) gives \( |AB| = 9 \) and \( |BC| = 9 \), resulting in a valid perimeter of 25.

Thus, the correct answer is:
