**Step 1: Analyze the given constraints**
- We know \( \text{LengthOf}(Line(R, T)) = 13 \).
- We know \( \text{LengthOf}(Line(X, Y)) = 7 \).
- We know \( \text{MeasureOf}(Angle(Z, X, Y)) = 124^\circ \).
- \( Y \) lies on line \( RT \).
- \( X \) lies on line \( RS \).
- \( Z \) lies on line \( TS \).
- \( XY \) and \( XZ \) are midsegments of \( \triangle RST \).

**Step 2: Understand the implications of midsegments**
- A midsegment in a triangle is a segment that connects the midpoints of two sides of the triangle. It is parallel to the third side and half its length.
- Since \( XY \) and \( XZ \) are midsegments, \( XY \parallel ST \) and \( XZ \parallel RS \).
- Therefore, \( \text{LengthOf}(XY) = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{LengthOf}(ST) \) and \( \text{LengthOf}(XZ) = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{LengthOf}(RS) \).

**Step 3: Use the length of the midsegment**
- Given \( \text{LengthOf}(XY) = 7 \), we have:
  \[
  7 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{LengthOf}(ST)
  \]
- Solving for \( \text{LengthOf}(ST) \):
  \[
  \text{LengthOf}(ST) = 2 \times 7 = 14
  \]

**Step 4: Verify the calculations and reasoning**
- The calculation \( \text{LengthOf}(ST) = 14 \) is consistent with the property of midsegments.
- No other constraints or conditions contradict this calculation.

**Step 5: Compare with answer choices**
- The calculated length of \( ST \) is 14, which matches choice C.

**Step 6: Select the closest answer**
- Since our calculated length matches exactly with choice C, we select C.

**Solution:**

Given the properties of midsegments in a triangle, we calculated the length of \( ST \) using the fact that \( XY \) is a midsegment and thus half the length of \( ST \). The calculation showed \( ST = 14 \), which corresponds to choice C.
