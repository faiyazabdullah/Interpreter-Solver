**Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints**

- We have four points \(X\), \(W\), \(Y\), and \(Z\) on the circle centered at \(A\) with radius 4.0.
- Points \(W\), \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\) lie on lines \(TW\), \(TX\), \(TY\), and \(TZ\) respectively.
- The lengths \(WX = 12\), \(TW = 7\), and \(TY = 6\) are given.
- We need to find the length \(ZY = x\).

**Step 2: Visualize the Geometry**

- Since all points lie on the circle with center \(A\) and radius 4, the circle equation is \((x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = 16\).
- Points \(W\), \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\) are equidistant from \(A\).

**Step 3: Use the Power of a Point Theorem**

- The power of a point theorem states that for a point \(T\) outside a circle, the product of the lengths of the segments of any secant line through \(T\) is constant.
- For line \(TWX\): \(TW \cdot TX = TA^2 - r^2\).
- For line \(TZY\): \(TZ \cdot TY = TA^2 - r^2\).

**Step 4: Calculate Using Known Lengths**

- From \(TW = 7\) and \(WX = 12\), we have \(TX = TW + WX = 19\).
- Using the power of a point for \(TWX\): \(TW \cdot TX = 7 \cdot 19 = 133\).

- From \(TY = 6\), we need to find \(TZ\) such that \(TZ \cdot TY = 133\).
- Let \(TZ = t\). Then \(t \cdot 6 = 133\).
- Solving for \(t\), we get \(t = \frac{133}{6}\).

**Step 5: Find \(ZY\)**

- Since \(TZ = t = \frac{133}{6}\) and \(TY = 6\), we have:
  \[
  ZY = TZ - TY = \frac{133}{6} - 6 = \frac{133}{6} - \frac{36}{6} = \frac{97}{6}
  \]

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated value of \(ZY\) is \(\frac{97}{6}\).
- This matches answer choice D.

</think>

**Solution:**

1. We used the power of a point theorem to find the relationship between the segments.
2. Calculated \(TX\) using \(TW\) and \(WX\).
3. Applied the theorem to find \(TZ\) using \(TY\).
4. Calculated \(ZY\) as the difference between \(TZ\) and \(TY\).
5. Found the closest match among the answer choices.
