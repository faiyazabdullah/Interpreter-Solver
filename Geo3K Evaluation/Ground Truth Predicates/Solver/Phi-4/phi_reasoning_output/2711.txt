1. **Analyzing the Given Information:**
   - We have a triangle formed by points A, B, and C.
   - Line BC is perpendicular to line BA.
   - ∠CAB = 45°.
   - AC = 12.
   - We need to find the length of AB, denoted as y.

2. **Understanding the Geometric Configuration:**
   - Since ∠CAB = 45° and line BA is perpendicular to line BC, triangle ABC is a right triangle with the right angle at B.
   - Thus, ∠ABC = 90° and ∠ACB = 45°.

3. **Applying the Properties of a 45-45-90 Triangle:**
   - In a 45-45-90 triangle, the legs are equal, and the hypotenuse is √2 times the length of each leg.
   - Here, AC is the hypotenuse.

4. **Using the Hypotenuse to Find the Legs:**
   - Given AC = 12, and AC is the hypotenuse, we can set up the relation for a 45-45-90 triangle:
     \[
     \text{Leg length} = \frac{\text{Hypotenuse}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{12}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{12 \times \sqrt{2}}{2} = 6\sqrt{2}
     \]

5. **Identifying the Length of AB:**
   - Since AB and BC are the legs of the 45-45-90 triangle, both are equal.
   - Therefore, y = AB = 6√2.

6. **Comparing with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated value of y is 6√2.
   - Among the given choices, C. \(6\sqrt{2}\) matches exactly.

7. **Verification:**
   - Reassess the setup and calculations to ensure no steps were missed or miscalculated.
   - The properties of the 45-45-90 triangle were correctly applied.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The solution process confirms that the length of AB is indeed 6√2, matching choice C.
</think>

**Solution:**
- Given the properties of the 45-45-90 triangle and the calculations, we determined that the length of AB (y) is 6√2.
- Therefore, the correct answer is C. 6√2.
