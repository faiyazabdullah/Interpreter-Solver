<think>
1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a geometric setup involving several lines and points. 
   - Points A, Y, X, W, and Z are involved, with several lengths specified.
   - Point A lies on lines YX and ZW, indicating A is the intersection of these lines.
   - We are given lengths involving point A and need to find the value of \( a \).

2. **Given Lengths:**
   - \( \text{Length of Line } (Y, A) = 2 \)
   - \( \text{Length of Line } (X, A) = a - 7 \)
   - \( \text{Length of Line } (W, A) = 10 \)
   - \( \text{Length of Line } (A, Z) = 2b - 6 \)

3. **Geometric Constraints:**
   - Since point A lies on line YX, the sum of lengths \( YA + AX \) should equal the total length of line YX.
   - Similarly, since A lies on line ZW, \( WA + AZ \) should equal the total length of line ZW.

4. **Parallelogram Property:**
   - In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal.
   - Assume YX and ZW are opposite sides of the parallelogram.
   - Therefore, \( YX = ZW \).

5. **Equation Setup:**
   - From \( YX = ZW \), we have:
     \[
     YA + AX = WA + AZ
     \]
   - Substitute the given lengths:
     \[
     2 + (a - 7) = 10 + (2b - 6)
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     a - 5 = 2b + 4
     \]
   - Rearrange:
     \[
     a = 2b + 9
     \]

6. **Finding \( a \):**
   - We need more information to find \( b \) or directly find \( a \).
   - Since \( a \) is expressed in terms of \( b \), we need to consider the options provided.
   - Check each option to see if it satisfies the equation \( a = 2b + 9 \).

7. **Verification with Answer Choices:**
   - **Option A: \( a = 2 \)**
     - \( 2 = 2b + 9 \) implies \( 2b = -7 \), which is not possible for real \( b \).
   - **Option B: \( a = 8 \)**
     - \( 8 = 2b + 9 \) implies \( 2b = -1 \), which is not possible for real \( b \).
   - **Option C: \( a = 9 \)**
     - \( 9 = 2b + 9 \) implies \( 2b = 0 \), so \( b = 0 \).
     - Check: \( WA + AZ = 10 + (2 \times 0 - 6) = 4 \)
     - \( YA + AX = 2 + (9 - 7) = 4 \)
     - Both sides equal, satisfying the condition.
   - **Option D: \( a = 10 \)**
     - \( 10 = 2b + 9 \) implies \( 2b = 1 \), so \( b = 0.5 \).
     - Check: \( WA + AZ = 10 + (2 \times 0.5 - 6) = 5 \)
     - \( YA + AX = 2 + (10 - 7) = 5 \)
     - Both sides equal, but \( a = 9 \) is a more straightforward solution.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The calculations confirm that \( a = 9 \) satisfies all conditions without introducing fractional values for \( b \).
</think>

<Solution>
Based on the analysis and verification with the given conditions and constraints, the correct value for \( a \) is 9. This satisfies the equation \( a = 2b + 9 \) with \( b = 0 \), ensuring both sides of the parallelogram are equal.
