1. **Analyzing the Given Constraints:**
   - We have four points: A, B, C, and D.
   - We know the lengths: BD = y, BC = 30, CD = 28, and AD = 8.
   - Point A lies on the line CD.
   - Angle ∠CBA is equal to angle ∠ABD.

2. **Understanding the Implications:**
   - Since point A lies on line CD, we can denote the segment lengths as CA = x and AD = 8. Therefore, CD = CA + AD = x + 8 = 28. Solving this gives x = 20.
   - The condition that ∠CBA = ∠ABD implies that triangle BCD and triangle BAD are related by the Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) condition, suggesting that triangles BCD and BAD could be similar.

3. **Exploring Similar Triangles:**
   - Since ∠CBA = ∠ABD, and both triangles share angle ∠BDC, triangles BCD and BAD are indeed similar by the Angle-Angle (AA) similarity criterion.

4. **Applying Similarity Ratios:**
   - From the similarity of triangles BCD and BAD, we have the ratio of corresponding sides:
     \[
     \frac{BC}{BD} = \frac{BD}{BA}
     \]
   - Plugging in known values, we get:
     \[
     \frac{30}{y} = \frac{y}{BA}
     \]
   - Cross-multiplying gives:
     \[
     30 \cdot BA = y^2
     \]

5. **Finding BA Using Similarity:**
   - From the similarity, we also have:
     \[
     \frac{CD}{AD} = \frac{BD}{BA}
     \]
   - Substituting known values:
     \[
     \frac{28}{8} = \frac{y}{BA}
     \]
   - Simplifying gives:
     \[
     \frac{7}{2} = \frac{y}{BA}
     \]
   - Therefore, \( BA = \frac{2y}{7} \).

6. **Substituting BA Back:**
   - Substitute \( BA = \frac{2y}{7} \) into the equation \( 30 \cdot BA = y^2 \):
     \[
     30 \cdot \frac{2y}{7} = y^2
     \]
   - Simplifying gives:
     \[
     \frac{60y}{7} = y^2
     \]
   - Multiplying through by 7 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     60y = 7y^2
     \]
   - Rearranging gives:
     \[
     7y^2 - 60y = 0
     \]
   - Factoring out y:
     \[
     y(7y - 60) = 0
     \]
   - This gives solutions \( y = 0 \) or \( 7y = 60 \).

7. **Solving for y:**
   - Since \( y = 0 \) is not feasible (as it represents a length), solve \( 7y = 60 \):
     \[
     y = \frac{60}{7} \approx 8.57
     \]

8. **Choosing the Closest Answer:**
   - The closest answer choice to \( y \approx 8.57 \) is 9.

<Solution>
Based on the calculations and analysis, the value of \( y \) is approximately 8.57. The closest answer choice is 9.
