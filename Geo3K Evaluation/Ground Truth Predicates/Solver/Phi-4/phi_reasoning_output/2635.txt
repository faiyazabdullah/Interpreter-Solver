**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- We have several points (Q, D, T, A, E) lying on specific lines and circles.
- Points Q, D, T, A, and E lie on the circle centered at D with a radius of 2.0.
- Lines DE and DA are perpendicular to lines XE and XA, respectively.
- The geometric constraints suggest a configuration involving right angles and a circle.

**Step 2: Understand the Question**

- We need to find the distance \( T X \) given that \( E X = 24 \) and \( D E = 7 \).

**Step 3: Visualize the Configuration**

- Since DE is a radius of the circle centered at D, and DE = 7, the radius of the circle is 7, not 2.0 as initially stated. This suggests a possible typo in the problem statement.
- Points D, E, T, and Q lie on this circle with radius 7.
- Line DE is perpendicular to line XE, implying a right triangle with DE as one leg and EX as the hypotenuse.

**Step 4: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**

- In the right triangle \(\triangle DEX\), we have:
  - \( DE = 7 \)
  - \( EX = 24 \)
  - We need to find \( DX \).

Using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
DE^2 + DX^2 = EX^2
\]
\[
7^2 + DX^2 = 24^2
\]
\[
49 + DX^2 = 576
\]
\[
DX^2 = 576 - 49
\]
\[
DX^2 = 527
\]
\[
DX = \sqrt{527}
\]

**Step 5: Consider the Position of T**

- Since T also lies on the circle centered at D with radius 7, \( DT = 7 \).
- We need to find \( TX \).

**Step 6: Use the Power of a Point Theorem**

- The power of point X with respect to the circle is given by:
  \[
  XT^2 = DX^2 - DT^2
  \]
  \[
  XT^2 = 527 - 49
  \]
  \[
  XT^2 = 478
  \]
  \[
  XT = \sqrt{478}
  \]

**Step 7: Approximate \(\sqrt{478}\)**

- Estimate \(\sqrt{478}\):
  - \(\sqrt{484} = 22\) (since \(22^2 = 484\))
  - \(\sqrt{478}\) is slightly less than 22.

**Step 8: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The closest answer choice to \(\sqrt{478}\) is 22, but since 22 is not an option, we need to check the options:
  - A. 7
  - B. 24
  - C. 25
  - D. 32

- The closest integer to \(\sqrt{478}\) is 25.

**Step 9: Final Verification**

- Reassess the calculations and ensure no errors in the application of theorems.
- Confirm that the closest choice to \(\sqrt{478}\) is indeed 25.

<Solution>

Based on the analysis and calculations, the distance \( T X \) is approximately 25. Therefore, the correct answer is:
