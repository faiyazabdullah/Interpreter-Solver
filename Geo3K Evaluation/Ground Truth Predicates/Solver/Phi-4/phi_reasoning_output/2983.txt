**Step 1: Understand the Problem and Constraints**

We are given a set of geometric constraints that define certain lengths and relationships between points and lines. The task is to cut four congruent triangles from the corners of a rectangle to form an octagon and then determine the area of this octagon. The constraints suggest a geometric figure with perpendicular lines, hinting at a rectangle or square with specific properties.

**Step 2: Analyze the Given Constraints**

- Lengths: 
  - \( |DJ| = 6 \)
  - \( |DK| = 6 \)
  - \( |FB| = 30 \)
  - \( |BC| = 20 \)

- Points on Lines:
  - \( K \) on \( AD \)
  - \( J \) on \( DC \)
  - \( L \) on \( DC \)
  - \( A \) on \( DF \)
  - \( K \) on \( DF \)
  - \( J \) on \( DL \)
  - \( H \) on \( FB \)
  - \( I \) on \( FB \) and \( FH \)
  - \( A \) on \( FK \)
  - \( H \) on \( IB \)
  - \( G \) on \( BC \)
  - \( M \) on \( BC \) and \( BG \)
  - \( L \) on \( CJ \)
  - \( G \) on \( CM \)

- Perpendicular Lines:
  - \( CD \perp DF \)
  - \( DF \perp FB \)
  - \( FB \perp BC \)
  - \( BC \perp CD \)

**Step 3: Visualize the Rectangle and Octagon Formation**

The perpendicular constraints suggest a rectangle \( ABCD \) with:
- \( AB = 30 \) (since \( |FB| = 30 \))
- \( BC = 20 \)

The task is to cut off four congruent triangles from the corners of this rectangle to form an octagon.

**Step 4: Determine the Size of the Triangles**

Since the triangles are congruent and cut from each corner, let the side length of each triangle be \( x \). The triangles are right triangles due to the perpendicular constraints.

**Step 5: Calculate the Dimensions of the Octagon**

The octagon will have:
- Two parallel sides of length \( 30 - 2x \) (originally \( AB \) and \( CD \))
- Two parallel sides of length \( 20 - 2x \) (originally \( BC \) and \( DA \))
- Four sides of length \( x \) (the hypotenuses of the triangles)

**Step 6: Calculate the Area of the Octagon**

The area of the rectangle is \( 30 \times 20 = 600 \).

The area of each triangle is \( \frac{1}{2}x^2 \).

The total area of the four triangles is \( 2x^2 \).

The area of the octagon is:
\[ \text{Area of Octagon} = 600 - 2x^2 \]

**Step 7: Determine \( x \) Using Given Constraints**

From the constraints \( |DJ| = 6 \) and \( |DK| = 6 \), and knowing \( J \) and \( K \) are on \( DC \) and \( AD \) respectively, \( x = 6 \).

**Step 8: Calculate the Area with \( x = 6 \)**

Substitute \( x = 6 \) into the area formula:
\[ \text{Area of Octagon} = 600 - 2(6^2) = 600 - 72 = 528 \]

**Step 9: Compare with Answer Choices**

The calculated area of the octagon is 528, which matches one of the answer choices.

Final Answer: B
</think>

**Solution**

The area of the octagon formed by cutting four congruent triangles from the corners of a rectangle with dimensions 30 by 20, where each triangle has legs of length 6, is calculated as follows:

1. Calculate the area of the original rectangle: \( 30 \times 20 = 600 \).
2. Calculate the area of one triangle: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times 6 = 18 \).
3. Calculate the total area of the four triangles: \( 4 \times 18 = 72 \).
4. Subtract the area of the triangles from the rectangle: \( 600 - 72 = 528 \).

Final Answer: B
