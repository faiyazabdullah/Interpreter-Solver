**Step 1: Analyze the given geometric constraints.**
- We have three points, K, J, and L, with the following distances:
  - \( KJ = 5 \)
  - \( LJ = 13 \)
  - \( LK = 12 \)
- The line \( KL \) is perpendicular to line \( KJ \). This implies that triangle \( KJL \) is a right triangle with \( \angle KJL = 90^\circ \).

**Step 2: Identify what needs to be found.**
- We are asked to find the ratio \(\tan(\angle L)\) as a decimal to the nearest hundredth. In triangle \( KJL \), \(\angle L\) is the angle at point L.

**Step 3: Apply relevant geometric theorems and properties.**
- Since \( \angle KJL = 90^\circ \), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to verify the side lengths:
  \[
  KJ^2 + JL^2 = LK^2 \Rightarrow 5^2 + 12^2 = 13^2 \Rightarrow 25 + 144 = 169
  \]
  The equation holds true, confirming \( \triangle KJL \) is a right triangle.

**Step 4: Calculate \(\tan(\angle L)\).**
- In a right triangle, \(\tan(\theta)\) for an angle \(\theta\) is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the adjacent side.
- For \(\angle L\) in \(\triangle KJL\), the opposite side is \( KJ = 5 \) and the adjacent side is \( JL = 12 \).
- Therefore, \(\tan(\angle L) = \frac{KJ}{JL} = \frac{5}{12}\).

**Step 5: Convert the ratio to a decimal.**
- Calculate \(\frac{5}{12}\):
  \[
  \frac{5}{12} \approx 0.4167
  \]
- Round \(0.4167\) to the nearest hundredth:
  \[
  0.4167 \approx 0.42
  \]

**Step 6: Compare with the given answer choices.**
- The calculated value \(0.42\) matches choice B.

**Step 7: Select the closest answer choice.**
- Since \(0.42\) is exactly one of the provided choices, we select B.

**Reflection:**
- The calculations have been verified and are consistent with the constraints and properties of the triangle. The rounding was done correctly to the nearest hundredth.
