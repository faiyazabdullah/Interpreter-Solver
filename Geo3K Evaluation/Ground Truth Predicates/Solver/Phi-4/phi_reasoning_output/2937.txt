1. **Analyzing the Given Information:**
   - We have three points A, B, and C with the following distances:
     - \( AC = 9 \)
     - \( AB = 15 \)
     - \( BC = x \)
   - Line \( CA \) is perpendicular to line \( CB \).

2. **Understanding the Implications:**
   - Since \( CA \perp CB \), triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \).
   - Therefore, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to find \( BC \).

3. **Applying the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   - In right triangle \( \triangle ABC \), where \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \), the Pythagorean theorem states:
     \[
     AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     15^2 = 9^2 + x^2
     \]
   - Calculate \( 15^2 \) and \( 9^2 \):
     \[
     225 = 81 + x^2
     \]

4. **Solving for \( x^2 \):**
   - Rearrange the equation to solve for \( x^2 \):
     \[
     x^2 = 225 - 81
     \]
   - Calculate \( 225 - 81 \):
     \[
     x^2 = 144
     \]

5. **Finding \( x \):**
   - Take the square root of both sides to find \( x \):
     \[
     x = \sqrt{144} = 12
     \]

6. **Verification and Comparison:**
   - Verify that the calculation is correct and consistent with the Pythagorean theorem.
   - Compare the calculated value of \( x = 12 \) with the given answer choices: A. 10, B. 11, C. 12, D. 13.
   - The calculated value matches choice C.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The calculated value of \( x \) is exactly 12, which matches one of the provided answer choices.

<Solution>
By applying the Pythagorean theorem to the right triangle \( \triangle ABC \), we found that:
\[
AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 \implies 15^2 = 9^2 + x^2 \implies 225 = 81 + x^2 \implies x^2 = 144 \implies x = 12
\]
The correct answer, based on the calculations, is \( x = 12 \), which corresponds to choice C.

Final Answer: C
