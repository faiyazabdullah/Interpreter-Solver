1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have two quadrilaterals: \(ACBD\) and \(EFGH\).
   - \(ACBD\) has an area of 400.
   - \(EFGH\) has an area of 64.
   - \(C, B\) are points on one line with a length of 40.
   - \(F, G\) are points on another line with a length of \(x\).
   - The quadrilaterals are similar.

2. **Identifying What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the length \(x\) of line \(FG\).

3. **Applying Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
   - Since the quadrilaterals are similar, the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths.
   - Let the ratio of similarity be \(k\). Then:
     \[
     \frac{\text{Area of } EFGH}{\text{Area of } ACBD} = k^2
     \]
   - Substituting the given areas:
     \[
     \frac{64}{400} = k^2
     \]
   - Simplifying:
     \[
     \frac{16}{100} = k^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{4}{25} = k^2
     \]
   - Solving for \(k\):
     \[
     k = \sqrt{\frac{4}{25}} = \frac{2}{5}
     \]

4. **Relating \(k\) to the Lengths:**
   - The length \(CB = 40\) corresponds to the length \(FG = x\).
   - Using the similarity ratio:
     \[
     \frac{x}{40} = \frac{2}{5}
     \]
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 40 \times \frac{2}{5} = 16
     \]

5. **Verification and Comparison:**
   - The calculated value of \(x\) is 16.
   - Comparing with the answer choices: A. 6.4, B. 16, C. 100, D. 250.
   - The calculated value matches choice B.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The calculated value of \(x\) is consistent with the given answer choices.
   - No need for further adjustments or considerations.
</think>

<Solution>
Given the similarity of the quadrilaterals and the relationship between their areas, we found that the similarity ratio \(k\) is \(\frac{2}{5}\). Using this ratio, we calculated the length \(x\) as 16. This matches choice B.
Final Answer: B
</Solution>
