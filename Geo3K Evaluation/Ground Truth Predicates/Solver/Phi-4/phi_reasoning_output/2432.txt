### Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Constraints
- We have several perpendicularity constraints between lines, suggesting the figure is composed of right angles.
- Length constraints are given: \( EB = 16 \) and \( AE = 9 \).
- Lines \( EB \) and \( EA \) are perpendicular, indicating \( \triangle AEB \) is a right triangle.

### Step 2: Identify the Figure
- Given the perpendicularity constraints, the figure is likely a rectangle or square, as all angles are right angles.
- The perpendicularity conditions suggest a rectangle with diagonals intersecting at right angles.

### Step 3: Determine the Shape
- \( \triangle AEB \) is a right triangle with \( AE \) as one leg and \( EB \) as the other.
- \( \angle AEB = 90^\circ \), confirming \( \triangle AEB \) is a right triangle.

### Step 4: Calculate the Area of the Rectangle
- Since \( \triangle AEB \) is a right triangle, \( AB \) is the hypotenuse.
- Use the Pythagorean theorem to find \( AB \):
  \[
  AB = \sqrt{AE^2 + EB^2} = \sqrt{9^2 + 16^2} = \sqrt{81 + 256} = \sqrt{337}
  \]
- The rectangle can be divided into two congruent right triangles, \( \triangle AEB \) and \( \triangle EBD \).
- The area of \( \triangle AEB \) is:
  \[
  \text{Area of } \triangle AEB = \frac{1}{2} \times AE \times EB = \frac{1}{2} \times 9 \times 16 = 72
  \]
- Since the rectangle is composed of two such triangles, the total area of the rectangle is:
  \[
  \text{Area of rectangle} = 2 \times 72 = 144
  \]

### Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices
- The calculated area of the rectangle is 144.
- The answer choices are A. 25, B. 50, C. 72, D. 144.
- The closest and exact match is D. 144.

### Step 6: Verify and Conclude
- Reassess all steps to ensure no miscalculations.
- The perpendicularity and length constraints confirm the figure is a rectangle.
- The calculations align with the properties of a rectangle formed by the given constraints.

**Solution:**

The figure is a rectangle formed by the given perpendicular and length constraints. The area of the rectangle, calculated using the right triangle \( \triangle AEB \) and doubling it, is 144. Therefore, the correct answer is:
