1. **Analyzing the Question:**
   - We are given that the angles of a triangle are in the ratio 3:2:1. This means if the angles are \(3x\), \(2x\), and \(x\), they must satisfy the triangle angle sum property which states that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.

2. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - We can express the sum of the angles as: 
     \[
     3x + 2x + x = 180
     \]
   - Simplifying this, we get:
     \[
     6x = 180
     \]

3. **Solving for \(x\):**
   - Divide both sides by 6 to find \(x\):
     \[
     x = \frac{180}{6} = 30
     \]

4. **Calculating the Angles:**
   - Using \(x = 30\), we can determine the measures of the angles:
     - The smallest angle is \(x = 30\) degrees.
     - The second angle is \(2x = 2 \times 30 = 60\) degrees.
     - The largest angle is \(3x = 3 \times 30 = 90\) degrees.

5. **Comparison with Answer Choices:**
   - Now, we have the angles: 30 degrees, 60 degrees, and 90 degrees.
   - We need to determine which angle measure is not present in the triangle:
     - A. 30 (Present)
     - B. 45 (Not Present)
     - C. 60 (Present)
     - D. 90 (Present)

6. **Verifying and Conclusion:**
   - From the calculated angles, 45 degrees is not an angle measure of this triangle.
   - Therefore, the correct choice that is not an angle measure of the triangle is 45 degrees.

<Solution>
To solve the problem, we used the given ratio of the angles, set up an equation based on the sum of the angles in a triangle, solved for \(x\), and calculated the individual angles. The angle measures were found to be 30 degrees, 60 degrees, and 90 degrees. Comparing these calculated angles with the answer choices, the angle measure that is not part of the triangle is 45 degrees. Thus, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
