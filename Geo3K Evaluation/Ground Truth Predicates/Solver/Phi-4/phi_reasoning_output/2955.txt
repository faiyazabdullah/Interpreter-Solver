**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- We have the geometric constraints involving points A, B, C, D, E and angles \(\angle 6\), \(\angle 7\), and \(\angle 8\).
- It's given that \(\angle 6\) and \(\angle 8\) are complementary, meaning \( \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 6) + \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 8) = 90^\circ \).
- We know \( \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 8) = 47^\circ \).
- We need to find the measure of \(\angle 7\).

**Step 2: Calculate the Measure of \(\angle 6\)**

- Using the complementary relationship, calculate \(\text{MeasureOf}(\angle 6)\):
  \[
  \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 6) = 90^\circ - \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 8) = 90^\circ - 47^\circ = 43^\circ
  \]

**Step 3: Understand the Relationship Between Angles**

- The angles are positioned such that:
  - \(\angle 6 = \angle CBA\)
  - \(\angle 7 = \angle EBA\)
  - \(\angle 8 = \angle DBA\)
- Point B lies on line CD, meaning B is between C and D on line CD.

**Step 4: Consider the Angle Relationships**

- Since point B lies on line CD, \(\angle CBA + \angle DBA = \angle CBA + \angle 8\) forms a straight line, which implies:
  \[
  \text{MeasureOf}(\angle CBA) + \text{MeasureOf}(\angle DBA) = 180^\circ
  \]
- We know \(\text{MeasureOf}(\angle CBA) = \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 6) = 43^\circ\) and \(\text{MeasureOf}(\angle DBA) = \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 8) = 47^\circ\).

**Step 5: Calculate the Remaining Angle \(\angle 7\)**

- Since \(\angle 7 = \angle EBA\) and \(\angle CBA + \angle EBA + \angle DBA = 180^\circ\) (since they form a straight line around point B):
  \[
  \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 7) = 180^\circ - \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 6) - \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 8)
  \]
  \[
  \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 7) = 180^\circ - 43^\circ - 47^\circ = 90^\circ
  \]

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated measure of \(\angle 7\) is \(90^\circ\).
- Compare this with the given answer choices: A. 43, B. 47, C. 86, D. 90.
- The closest and exact match is option D.

**Step 7: Conclusion**

- Based on the calculations and comparisons, the measure of \(\angle 7\) is \(90^\circ\).
- Select the answer choice that matches this calculation.

**Solution:**

1. Calculate \(\text{MeasureOf}(\angle 6)\) using the complementary relationship:
   \[
   \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 6) = 90^\circ - 47^\circ = 43^\circ
   \]

2. Use the straight line property at point B:
   \[
   \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 7) = 180^\circ - \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 6) - \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 8) = 180^\circ - 43^\circ - 47^\circ = 90^\circ
   \]

3. Compare the calculated measure of \(\angle 7\) with the answer choices and select the closest match.

Final Answer: D
