**Step 1: Understand the Problem and Constraints**

We are given several geometric constraints involving points lying on lines and circles, as well as perpendicular lines. The points \(A, B, C, D, M, N, X, Y, Z\) all lie on the circle \(\odot X\) with radius \(r = 0_0_0\). We know:
- \(AB = 30\)
- \(CD = 30\)
- \(\angle CZ = 40^\circ\)

We need to find \(\angle CD\).

**Step 2: Analyze the Circle and Arcs**

Since \(A, B, C, D, M, N, X, Y, Z\) lie on \(\odot X\), they form arcs on the circle. The key is to understand the relationship between the arcs and the angles subtended by these arcs at the center of the circle.

**Step 3: Use the Given Information**

- \(AB = 30\) and \(CD = 30\) imply that arcs \(AB\) and \(CD\) are equal.
- \(\angle CZ = 40^\circ\) is the angle subtended by arc \(CZ\).

**Step 4: Apply Circle Theorems**

- The angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice the angle subtended at any point on the circumference.
- Therefore, if \(\angle CZ = 40^\circ\), the arc \(CZ\) subtends an angle of \(80^\circ\) at the center.

**Step 5: Determine \(\angle CD\)**

Since \(CD = 30\) and \(AB = 30\), arcs \(CD\) and \(AB\) are equal. Therefore, the angle subtended by arc \(CD\) at the center is the same as that subtended by arc \(AB\).

- Since \(AB\) and \(CD\) are equal chords, they subtend equal angles at the center.
- The angle subtended by arc \(CZ\) at the center is \(80^\circ\).

**Step 6: Calculate \(\angle CD\)**

- Since \(CD\) is an arc and \(\angle CZ = 40^\circ\), we need to find the angle subtended by arc \(CD\) at the center.
- The angle subtended by arc \(CD\) at the center is the same as that subtended by arc \(AB\) because \(AB = CD\).

**Step 7: Use the Perpendicularity Condition**

- The perpendicularity condition \(Perpendicular(Line(Y, M), Line(M, A))\) and \(Perpendicular(Line(N, D), Line(Z, N))\) might help in understanding the symmetry or specific configuration, but since \(AB = CD\), they subtend equal angles.

**Step 8: Final Calculation**

- Since \(\angle CZ = 40^\circ\) and \(CD\) is equal to \(AB\), the angle subtended by arc \(CD\) at the center is the same as that subtended by arc \(AB\).
- Therefore, \(\angle CD = 40^\circ\).

**Step 9: Compare with Answer Choices**

The calculated \(\angle CD = 40^\circ\) matches choice B.

**Step 10: Conclusion**

Based on the analysis and calculations, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
