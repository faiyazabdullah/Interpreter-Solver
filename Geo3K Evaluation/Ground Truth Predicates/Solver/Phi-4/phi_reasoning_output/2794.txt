**Step 1: Analyze the given geometric constraints.**

- We have two quadrilaterals: \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\).
- The area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is 32.
- The area of quadrilateral \(EFGH\) is 8.
- The quadrilaterals are similar figures.

**Step 2: Identify what needs to be found.**

- We need to find the scale factor from the blue figure (\(ABCD\)) to the green figure (\(EFGH\)).

**Step 3: Apply relevant geometric properties.**

- For similar figures, the ratio of their areas is the square of the scale factor.
- Let the scale factor from \(ABCD\) to \(EFGH\) be \(k\).
- Therefore, \((\text{Area of } ABCD) / (\text{Area of } EFGH) = k^2\).

**Step 4: Set up the equation using the given areas.**

- \(\frac{32}{8} = k^2\).

**Step 5: Solve for \(k\).**

- \(\frac{32}{8} = 4\).
- So, \(k^2 = 4\).
- Taking the square root of both sides, \(k = \sqrt{4} = 2\).

**Step 6: Determine the direction of the scale factor.**

- Since we are finding the scale factor from \(ABCD\) to \(EFGH\), and \(k = 2\), the scale factor is \(\frac{1}{2}\) (since \(EFGH\) is smaller).

**Step 7: Compare the calculated scale factor with the answer choices.**

- The calculated scale factor is \(\frac{1}{2}\).
- This matches answer choice B.

**Step 8: Verify and finalize the answer.**

- All steps align with the properties of similar figures and the given constraints.
- The closest match to the calculated scale factor is choice B.

**Solution:**

1. Given that the areas of the similar quadrilaterals \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\) are 32 and 8, respectively, we use the property of similar figures: the ratio of their areas is the square of the scale factor.
2. Set up the equation: \(\frac{32}{8} = k^2\).
3. Simplify to find \(k^2 = 4\).
4. Solve for \(k\) to get \(k = 2\).
5. Since \(EFGH\) is smaller, the scale factor from \(ABCD\) to \(EFGH\) is \(\frac{1}{2}\).
6. The closest match to \(\frac{1}{2}\) is answer choice B.
