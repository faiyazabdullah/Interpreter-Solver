**Step 1: Analyze the given geometric constraints and understand the problem.**

- We have two line segments: \( \overline{XW} \) and \( \overline{YX} \).
- The length of \( \overline{XW} \) is given by \( 2x + 9 \).
- The length of \( \overline{YX} \) is given by \( 3x + 6 \).
- Points \( Y \) and \( W \) lie on a circle centered at \( Z \) with a radius of 3.0.
- The segment \( \overline{XY} \) is tangent to the circle.

**Step 2: Identify what needs to be found.**

- We need to find the value of \( x \) such that \( \overline{XY} \) is tangent to the circle.

**Step 3: Apply relevant geometric theorems and properties.**

- A tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency.
- Since \( \overline{XY} \) is tangent to the circle at point \( Y \), \( \overline{ZY} \) is perpendicular to \( \overline{XY} \).
- The distance from the center \( Z \) to the tangent point \( Y \) is equal to the radius of the circle, which is 3.0.

**Step 4: Use the Pythagorean theorem.**

- Since \( \overline{ZY} \) is perpendicular to \( \overline{XY} \), we can form a right triangle \( \triangle ZXY \).
- In this triangle, \( ZY = 3 \) (radius), and \( YX = 3x + 6 \).
- We need to find \( ZX \) using the Pythagorean theorem:
  \[
  ZX^2 = ZY^2 + YX^2
  \]
  \[
  ZX^2 = 3^2 + (3x + 6)^2
  \]
  \[
  ZX^2 = 9 + (3x + 6)^2
  \]

**Step 5: Calculate \( WX \) using the given length of \( \overline{XW} \).**

- Since \( W \) also lies on the circle, \( ZW = 3 \).
- We have \( XW = 2x + 9 \).

**Step 6: Use the power of a point theorem.**

- The power of a point theorem states that for a point \( X \) outside a circle, the power is given by:
  \[
  XW \cdot XY = XZ^2 - Z^2
  \]
  \[
  (2x + 9)(3x + 6) = ZX^2 - 9
  \]

**Step 7: Substitute and solve for \( x \).**

- From the Pythagorean theorem, we have:
  \[
  ZX^2 = 9 + (3x + 6)^2
  \]
  \[
  ZX^2 = 9 + 9x^2 + 36x + 36
  \]
  \[
  ZX^2 = 9x^2 + 36x + 45
  \]

- Substitute \( ZX^2 \) in the power of a point equation:
  \[
  (2x + 9)(3x + 6) = 9x^2 + 36x + 45 - 9
  \]
  \[
  (2x + 9)(3x + 6) = 9x^2 + 36x + 36
  \]

- Expand the left side:
  \[
  6x^2 + 12x + 27x + 54 = 9x^2 + 36x + 36
  \]
  \[
  6x^2 + 39x + 54 = 9x^2 + 36x + 36
  \]

- Rearrange the equation:
  \[
  0 = 9x^2 + 36x + 36 - 6x^2 - 39x - 54
  \]
  \[
  0 = 3x^2 - 3x - 18
  \]

- Simplify:
  \[
  x^2 - x - 6 = 0
  \]

- Factor the quadratic:
  \[
  (x - 3)(x + 2) = 0
  \]

- Solve for \( x \):
  \[
  x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2
  \]

**Step 8: Verify and select the correct answer.**

- Since \( x \) represents a length, it must be positive. Therefore, \( x = 3 \).

**Step 9: Compare with answer choices.**

- The calculated value \( x = 3 \) matches choice B.
