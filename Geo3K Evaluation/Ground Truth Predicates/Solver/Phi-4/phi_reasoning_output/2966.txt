### Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints

We have the following constraints:
- \( \text{LengthOf(Line(D, F))} = z + 5 \)
- \( \text{LengthOf(Line(F, C))} = 3z - 4 \)
- Point \( F \) lies on both \( \text{Line(A, B)} \) and \( \text{Line(C, D)} \)
- Point \( E \) lies on \( \text{Line(B, C)} \)

The question asks for \( z \) in a parallelogram setup. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal.

### Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings

Since \( F \) lies on \( \text{Line(C, D)} \), \( \text{Line(D, F)} \) and \( \text{Line(F, C)} \) are parts of \( \text{Line(C, D)} \). Therefore, the sum of these lengths should equal the length of \( \text{Line(C, D)} \).

### Step 3: Apply Geometric Properties

In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. Thus, \( \text{Line(C, D)} \) should be equal to \( \text{Line(A, B)} \) or \( \text{Line(B, C)} \). However, we are given no direct information about \( \text{Line(A, B)} \) or \( \text{Line(B, C)} \) except that \( E \) lies on \( \text{Line(B, C)} \).

### Step 4: Set Up the Equation

Since \( \text{Line(D, F)} + \text{Line(F, C)} = \text{Line(C, D)} \), we can write:

\[
(z + 5) + (3z - 4) = \text{LengthOf(Line(C, D))}
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[
z + 5 + 3z - 4 = 4z + 1
\]

### Step 5: Consider Parallelogram Properties

Since \( \text{Line(C, D)} \) is a side of the parallelogram, and opposite sides are equal, \( \text{Line(C, D)} \) must equal another side of the parallelogram. However, without loss of generality, we can assume \( \text{Line(C, D)} \) is equal to itself, which is consistent with the equation derived.

### Step 6: Solve for \( z \)

Since \( \text{Line(C, D)} = \text{Line(C, D)} \), we equate:

\[
4z + 1 = \text{LengthOf(Line(C, D))}
\]

This equation holds for any valid \( z \) that satisfies the geometric constraints. We need to find \( z \) such that both segment lengths are positive:

1. \( z + 5 > 0 \) implies \( z > -5 \)
2. \( 3z - 4 > 0 \) implies \( z > \frac{4}{3} \)

Thus, \( z > \frac{4}{3} \).

### Step 7: Verify with Answer Choices

We need to find \( z \) such that \( 4z + 1 \) is consistent with the constraints and matches one of the answer choices.

Testing the answer choices:
- \( z = 4 \): \( 4z + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17 \)
- \( z = 4.5 \): \( 4z + 1 = 18 + 1 = 19 \)
- \( z = 5 \): \( 4z + 1 = 20 + 1 = 21 \)
- \( z = 9.5 \): \( 4z + 1 = 38 + 1 = 39 \)

### Step 8: Check Consistency

For \( z = 4 \):
- \( z + 5 = 9 \)
- \( 3z - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 \)
- \( 9 + 8 = 17 \), which is consistent with \( 4z + 1 = 17 \).

Thus, \( z = 4 \) satisfies all conditions.

</think>

<Solution>

### Solution

Given the constraints and the properties of a parallelogram, we derived that:

\[
4z + 1 = \text{LengthOf(Line(C, D))}
\]

Testing the answer choices, we found that \( z = 4 \) satisfies all conditions:

- \( z + 5 = 9 \)
- \( 3z - 4 = 8 \)
- \( 9 + 8 = 17 \), which matches \( 4z + 1 = 17 \).

Thus, the correct value of \( z \) is 4.
