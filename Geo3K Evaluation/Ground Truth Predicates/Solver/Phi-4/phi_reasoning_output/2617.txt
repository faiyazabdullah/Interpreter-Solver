1. **Analyze the given geometric constraints:**
   - We have a triangle \( \triangle DEF \) with sides \( DE = f = 20 \), \( DF = e \), and \( FE = d \).
   - The angles are given as \( m \angle E = 108^\circ \) and \( m \angle F = 26^\circ \).
   - To find the third angle \( m \angle D \), use the angle sum property of a triangle:
     \[
     m \angle D = 180^\circ - m \angle E - m \angle F = 180^\circ - 108^\circ - 26^\circ = 46^\circ
     \]

2. **Identify what needs to be found:**
   - We need to find the length of side \( FE = d \).

3. **Apply the Law of Sines:**
   - The Law of Sines states:
     \[
     \frac{d}{\sin D} = \frac{f}{\sin F} = \frac{e}{\sin E}
     \]
   - We need to find \( d \), so we use:
     \[
     \frac{d}{\sin 46^\circ} = \frac{20}{\sin 26^\circ}
     \]

4. **Calculate \( d \) using the Law of Sines:**
   - First, calculate the sine values:
     \[
     \sin 46^\circ \approx 0.7193
     \]
     \[
     \sin 26^\circ \approx 0.4384
     \]
   - Substitute these values into the equation:
     \[
     \frac{d}{0.7193} = \frac{20}{0.4384}
     \]
   - Solve for \( d \):
     \[
     d = \frac{20 \times 0.7193}{0.4384} \approx \frac{14.386}{0.4384} \approx 32.8
     \]

5. **Round \( d \) to the nearest whole number:**
   - \( d \approx 33 \)

6. **Compare with the answer choices:**
   - The calculated value of \( d \) is approximately 33, which matches choice B.

7. **Verification and reflection:**
   - Recheck calculations to ensure no arithmetic errors.
   - Verify that the use of the Law of Sines was appropriate given the angle and side information.
   - Confirm that rounding to the nearest whole number was correctly applied.

8. **Select the closest answer choice:**
   - The closest answer choice to 33 is B.

</think>

<Solution>
Based on the calculations using the Law of Sines and rounding to the nearest whole number, the length of side \( FE = d \) is approximately 33. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
