**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- We are given that the measure of Arc \( BE \) is 120 degrees.
- The angle \( \angle CBA \) is equal to \( \angle 9 \).
- Point \( E \) lies on line \( AB \).
- Points \( B \) and \( E \) lie on the circle centered at \( D \) with a radius of 3.0.

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**

- Since \( B \) and \( E \) lie on the circle with center \( D \), \( DB = DE = 3.0 \).
- The arc \( BE \) is 120 degrees, which means the central angle \( \angle BDE \) is also 120 degrees because the measure of an arc is equal to the measure of the central angle that subtends it.

**Step 3: Explore Geometric Relationships**

- Since \( E \) lies on line \( AB \), \( E \) is collinear with \( A \) and \( B \).
- \( \angle CBA \) is an inscribed angle that subtends the arc \( BE \).
- The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends.

**Step 4: Calculate the Measure of \( \angle 9 \)**

- Since \( \angle CBA \) subtends arc \( BE \), we use the inscribed angle theorem:
  \[
  \angle CBA = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Measure of Arc } BE = \frac{1}{2} \times 120 = 60 \text{ degrees}
  \]

**Step 5: Verify and Reassess**

- Verify that all given conditions are satisfied with this calculation.
- The calculation is consistent with the properties of circles and inscribed angles.

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated measure of \( \angle 9 \) is 60 degrees.
- Compare this with the given answer choices: A. 60, B. 120, C. 240, D. 300.
- The closest and exact match is option A.

**Step 7: Finalize the Solution**

- Based on the analysis and calculations, the correct answer is 60 degrees.

**Solution:**

The measure of \( \angle 9 \) is calculated using the inscribed angle theorem, which states that an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends. Given that the arc \( BE \) measures 120 degrees, the inscribed angle \( \angle CBA \) (which is \( \angle 9 \)) measures 60 degrees. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A
