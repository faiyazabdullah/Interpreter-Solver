**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**
- We know that quadrilateral DEFG is a rectangle. This implies that all interior angles are right angles (90 degrees).
- Angles \(\angle EFD\) and \(\angle DFG\) are angles within this rectangle.
- The perpendicularity constraint provided, Perpendicular(Line(D, G), Line(G, F)), is consistent with DEFG being a rectangle since adjacent sides of a rectangle are perpendicular.

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**
- We need to find the measure of \(\angle EFD\), given \(m \angle EFD = 2x - 3\) and \(m \angle DFG = x + 12\).

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Properties**
- Since DEFG is a rectangle, \(\angle EFD\) and \(\angle DFG\) are interior angles of the rectangle and they are supplementary (since they form a linear pair along the line DF). Thus:
  \[
  m \angle EFD + m \angle DFG = 90^\circ
  \]

**Step 4: Set Up the Equation**
- Substitute the given expressions for the angles:
  \[
  (2x - 3) + (x + 12) = 90
  \]

**Step 5: Solve the Equation**
- Combine like terms:
  \[
  3x + 9 = 90
  \]
- Subtract 9 from both sides:
  \[
  3x = 81
  \]
- Divide by 3:
  \[
  x = 27
  \]

**Step 6: Calculate \(m \angle EFD\)**
- Substitute \(x = 27\) back into the expression for \(m \angle EFD\):
  \[
  m \angle EFD = 2x - 3 = 2(27) - 3 = 54 - 3 = 51
  \]

**Step 7: Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated measure for \(\angle EFD\) is 51, which matches answer choice A.

**Step 8: Verify**
- Reassess the setup and calculations to ensure no errors:
  - The supplementary angle condition was correctly applied.
  - The algebraic manipulation was verified to be correct.
  - The calculated angle fits the context of the problem and the constraints of a rectangle.
