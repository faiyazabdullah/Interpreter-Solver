**Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints**

We are given a geometric configuration involving four points A, D, B, and C, with the following constraints:

- \(AD = 15\)
- \(DB = 10\)
- \(AC = 14\)
- \(AC \perp AD\)
- \(DB \perp DA\)

The task is to find the area of the trapezoid formed by these points.

**Step 2: Understand the Geometry**

From the given constraints, we can infer:
- \(AD\) and \(DB\) are perpendicular, forming a right angle at D.
- \(AC\) and \(AD\) are perpendicular, forming a right angle at A.

This suggests that we have two right triangles: \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ADB\).

**Step 3: Visualize the Configuration**

Since \(AC \perp AD\) and \(DB \perp DA\), point D is a common vertex where two right angles meet. This suggests a rectangular arrangement:
- \(AD\) is a vertical line.
- \(DB\) is a horizontal line.
- \(AC\) is another line perpendicular to \(AD\).

**Step 4: Calculate the Area of the Trapezoid**

The trapezoid in question is \(ABCD\), with \(AD\) and \(BC\) as the non-parallel sides (legs), and \(AB\) and \(CD\) as the parallel sides (bases).

Since \(AD\) and \(DB\) are perpendicular, \(\triangle ADB\) is a right triangle with:
- Base \(DB = 10\)
- Height \(AD = 15\)

The area of \(\triangle ADB\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ADB = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 15 = 75
\]

Similarly, since \(AC \perp AD\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with:
- Base \(AC = 14\)
- Height \(AD = 15\)

The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \times 14 \times 15 = 105
\]

**Step 5: Calculate the Total Area of Quadrilateral \(ABCD\)**

The quadrilateral \(ABCD\) consists of two right triangles \(\triangle ADB\) and \(\triangle ACD\). The total area is the sum of these two areas:
\[
\text{Total Area} = 75 + 105 = 180
\]

**Step 6: Verify and Compare with Answer Choices**

The calculated area of the trapezoid \(ABCD\) is 180. Comparing this with the given answer choices:

- A. 45
- B. 90
- C. 180
- D. 360

The closest and correct choice is 180.

**Step 7: Final Answer**

Final Answer: C

</think>

**Solution**

The area of the trapezoid \(ABCD\) is calculated by summing the areas of the two right triangles \(\triangle ADB\) and \(\triangle ACD\). The total area is 180, which matches choice C. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: C
