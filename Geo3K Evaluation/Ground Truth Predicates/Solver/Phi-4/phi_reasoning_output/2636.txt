**Thought Section:**

1. **Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints:**
   - We know that \(\angle AGE = 55^\circ\).
   - We need to find the measure of \(\angle BGA = x\).
   - Point \(G\) lies on line \(AC\), and point \(B\) lies on line \(GF\). 
   - Line \(BD\) is parallel to line \(AG\).

2. **Identify Key Geometric Relationships:**
   - Since \(BD \parallel AG\) and \(BG\) is a transversal, \(\angle BGA\) and \(\angle AGE\) are alternate interior angles.
   - Alternate interior angles are equal when two lines are parallel and cut by a transversal.

3. **Apply Geometric Theorems:**
   - From the alternate interior angle theorem, \(\angle BGA = \angle AGE = 55^\circ\).

4. **Verify the Calculations:**
   - The calculation is straightforward due to the parallel lines and transversal creating alternate interior angles.
   - There are no additional calculations needed as the relationship directly gives us the measure.

5. **Reflect and Reassess:**
   - Reassess the given conditions and calculations to ensure no details were overlooked.
   - Confirm that the relationship between the angles due to parallel lines was correctly identified and applied.

6. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated value for \(x\) is \(55^\circ\).
   - Compare this with the given answer choices: A. 55, B. 115, C. 125, D. 135.
   - The closest match is choice A.

7. **Final Decision:**
   - Based on the analysis, the correct answer is \(x = 55^\circ\).

**Solution Section:**

Given the parallel lines \(BD \parallel AG\) and the transversal \(BG\), the alternate interior angle theorem tells us that \(\angle BGA = \angle AGE = 55^\circ\). Therefore, the value of \(x\) is \(55\).

Final Answer: A
