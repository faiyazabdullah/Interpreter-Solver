**Step 1: Understand the Geometric Setup**

- We are given that \( \odot O \) is a circle with center \( O \) and several points \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) lying on it.
- \( EC \) and \( AB \) are diameters of the circle.
- The angles \( \angle BOD \), \( \angle DOE \), \( \angle EOF \), and \( \angle FOA \) are congruent.

**Step 2: Analyze the Angle Information**

- Since \( EC \) and \( AB \) are diameters, \( \angle AOB = 180^\circ \) and \( \angle COE = 180^\circ \).
- The circle is divided into equal angles by \( \angle BOD \), \( \angle DOE \), \( \angle EOF \), and \( \angle FOA \).
- Since these angles are congruent and they cover the entire circle, each angle must be \( \frac{360^\circ}{4} = 90^\circ \).

**Step 3: Determine the Position of Points**

- The points \( B, D, E, F, A \) are positioned such that:
  - \( \angle BOD = 90^\circ \)
  - \( \angle DOE = 90^\circ \)
  - \( \angle EOF = 90^\circ \)
  - \( \angle FOA = 90^\circ \)

**Step 4: Calculate \( m \widehat{AC} \)**

- Since \( AB \) and \( EC \) are diameters, \( A \) and \( C \) are endpoints of a diameter.
- The arc \( AC \) is a semicircle because \( A \) and \( C \) are endpoints of a diameter.
- Therefore, \( m \widehat{AC} = 180^\circ \).

**Step 5: Verify and Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated measure of \( m \widehat{AC} \) is \( 180^\circ \).
- Among the answer choices, \( 180^\circ \) corresponds to option C.

**Step 6: Finalize the Answer**

- Based on the analysis and calculations, the correct answer is option C.

**Solution:**

Given the geometric constraints and the equal division of the circle into four \( 90^\circ \) angles, the points \( A \) and \( C \) are endpoints of a diameter. Therefore, the measure of the arc \( AC \) is \( 180^\circ \). This matches option C.

Final Answer: C
