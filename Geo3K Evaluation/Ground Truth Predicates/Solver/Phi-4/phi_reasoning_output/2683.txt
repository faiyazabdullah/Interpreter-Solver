### Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints
We have a set of points \( P, Q, R, S, T \) with specific distances and parallel lines. The constraints are:
- \( \text{LengthOf}(P, Q) = 6 - x \)
- \( \text{LengthOf}(Q, R) = 6 + x \)
- \( \text{LengthOf}(T, Q) = 3 \)
- \( \text{LengthOf}(S, Q) = 3 + x \)
- \( Q \) lies on both lines \( \overline{TS} \) and \( \overline{PR} \)
- \( \overline{SR} \parallel \overline{TP} \)

### Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found
We need to find the distance \( PQ \).

### Step 3: Use Geometric Properties and Theorems
Given that \( \overline{SR} \parallel \overline{TP} \) and \( Q \) lies on both lines \( \overline{TS} \) and \( \overline{PR} \), we can use the properties of parallel lines and transversals.

### Step 4: Consider the Parallel Lines
Since \( \overline{SR} \parallel \overline{TP} \), and \( Q \) is a point on the transversal \( \overline{PR} \) and \( \overline{TS} \), we can use the properties of similar triangles or the intercept theorem (also known as the basic proportionality theorem).

### Step 5: Apply the Intercept Theorem
The intercept theorem states that if a line parallel to one side of a triangle intersects the other two sides, it divides those sides proportionally.

For triangles \( \triangle TQS \) and \( \triangle PQR \):
\[
\frac{TQ}{QS} = \frac{PQ}{QR}
\]

Substitute the known values:
\[
\frac{3}{3 + x} = \frac{6 - x}{6 + x}
\]

### Step 6: Solve the Proportion
Cross-multiply to solve for \( x \):
\[
3(6 + x) = (3 + x)(6 - x)
\]

Expanding both sides:
\[
18 + 3x = 18 - 3x + 6x - x^2
\]

Simplify:
\[
18 + 3x = 18 + 3x - x^2
\]

Subtract \( 18 + 3x \) from both sides:
\[
0 = -x^2
\]

This implies:
\[
x^2 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 0
\]

### Step 7: Calculate \( PQ \)
Substitute \( x = 0 \) back into the expression for \( PQ \):
\[
PQ = 6 - x = 6 - 0 = 6
\]

### Step 8: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated value for \( PQ \) is 6, which matches option C.

### Step 9: Verify and Conclude
All steps align with the given constraints and geometric properties. The calculations are consistent and correct.

**Solution:**

Based on the analysis and calculations, the distance \( PQ \) is found to be 6. Therefore, the correct answer choice is:
