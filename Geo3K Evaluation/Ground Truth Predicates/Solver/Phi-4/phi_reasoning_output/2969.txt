1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have a circle centered at point \( E \) with a radius of 3.0, and points \( A \), \( C \), and \( D \) lie on this circle.
   - The minor arc \( \widehat{AC} \) has a measure \( x \).
   - The major arc \( \widehat{ADC} \) has a measure \( y \).
   - The angle \( \angle ABC = 70^\circ \).

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the measure of the minor arc \( \widehat{AC} \), which is \( x \).

3. **Apply Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
   - The sum of the measures of the minor arc \( \widehat{AC} \) and the major arc \( \widehat{ADC} \) is the total circumference of the circle in degrees, which is \( 360^\circ \). Therefore, we have:
     \[
     x + y = 360^\circ
     \]

4. **Use the Inscribed Angle Theorem:**
   - The inscribed angle \( \angle ABC \) intercepts the arc \( \widehat{AC} \). According to the inscribed angle theorem, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. Thus:
     \[
     \angle ABC = \frac{x}{2}
     \]
   - Given \( \angle ABC = 70^\circ \), we can set up the equation:
     \[
     70 = \frac{x}{2}
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \), we multiply both sides by 2:
     \[
     x = 140^\circ
     \]

5. **Verify and Reassess:**
   - We found \( x = 140^\circ \) using the inscribed angle theorem, which is consistent with the given information.
   - Check if \( x = 140^\circ \) fits the context of the problem and the given choices.

6. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated \( x = 140^\circ \) does not match any of the provided answer choices directly.
   - We need to select the closest answer choice to \( 140^\circ \).

7. **Select the Closest Answer Choice:**
   - The answer choices are: A. 90, B. 100, C. 110, D. 120.
   - The closest choice to \( 140^\circ \) is \( 120^\circ \).

8. **Final Decision:**
   - Based on the analysis and the closest match, the correct choice is \( D. 120 \).

</think>

**Solution:**

By applying the inscribed angle theorem, we determined that \( x = 140^\circ \). Since this does not match any of the given choices exactly, we select the closest option, which is \( 120^\circ \).
