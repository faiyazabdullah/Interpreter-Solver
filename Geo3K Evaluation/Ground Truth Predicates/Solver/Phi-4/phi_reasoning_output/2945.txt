### Thought Section

1. **Analyzing the Given Information**:
   - We have several points: \( J, K, F, G, A, H, B, C \).
   - Several angles are given: \( \angle KBF = 88^\circ \) and \( \angle JBG = 26^\circ \).
   - Points \( F, G, J, \) and \( K \) lie on the circle with center \( B \) and radius 4.0.
   - Lines: \( F \) on \( \overline{AG} \), \( G \) on \( \overline{AH} \), \( F \) on \( \overline{AH} \), \( J \) on \( \overline{HK} \), \( K \) on \( \overline{HC} \), \( J \) on \( \overline{HC} \), \( G \) on \( \overline{HF} \), and \( K \) on \( \overline{JC} \).

2. **Identifying What Needs to Be Found**:
   - We need to find \( m \angle H \).

3. **Understanding the Geometry**:
   - Points \( J, K, F, G \) lie on the circle with center \( B \). This implies that \( \angle JBF, \angle KBF, \angle JBG, \) and \( \angle KBG \) are inscribed angles.
   - Since \( \angle KBF = 88^\circ \) and \( \angle JBG = 26^\circ \), we can use the inscribed angle theorem which states that an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.

4. **Exploring the Relationships**:
   - Since \( J, K, F, G \) are on the circle, \( \angle JBF + \angle KBF + \angle JBG + \angle KBG = 180^\circ \) (since they form a semicircle).
   - We know \( \angle KBF = 88^\circ \) and \( \angle JBG = 26^\circ \).
   - Let \( \angle JBF = x \) and \( \angle KBG = y \).
   - Then, \( x + 88^\circ + 26^\circ + y = 180^\circ \).
   - Simplifying, \( x + y = 66^\circ \).

5. **Using Line Constraints**:
   - \( J \) lies on \( \overline{HK} \) and \( K \) lies on \( \overline{HC} \), meaning \( H \) is a common point.
   - \( G \) lies on \( \overline{HF} \), meaning \( H \) is also a common point for \( G \) and \( F \).
   - \( G \) lies on \( \overline{AH} \) and \( F \) lies on \( \overline{AH} \), so \( \overline{AH} \) is a line through \( G \) and \( F \).

6. **Determining \( m \angle H \)**:
   - Since \( \angle JBG = 26^\circ \) and \( G \) lies on \( \overline{HF} \), \( \angle H \) could be related to \( \angle JBG \).
   - \( \angle H \) is likely the angle formed by \( \overline{HF} \) and \( \overline{HG} \).
   - Since \( G \) and \( F \) are on the circle and \( \angle JBG = 26^\circ \), \( \angle H \) could be \( 26^\circ \) because it is the angle subtended by the same arc \( \overline{JG} \).

7. **Verification and Conclusion**:
   - Given the constraints and the geometry, \( m \angle H = 26^\circ \) seems consistent with the given information and the circle's properties.

<Solution>
### Solution Section

Based on the analysis, the angle \( m \angle H \) is determined to be \( 26^\circ \) due to the inscribed angle properties and the given constraints. The angle \( \angle JBG = 26^\circ \) suggests that \( \angle H \), formed by lines through points on the circle, is also \( 26^\circ \).

Therefore, the correct answer is:
