**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- We are given that the measure of arc \( \overset{\frown}{XBY} \) is 96 degrees. This implies that \( \angle XBY \), the central angle subtended by this arc, is also 96 degrees because the measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of the arc it subtends.

- We are given that the measure of \( \angle XWY \) is 49 degrees. This angle is formed by the lines \( XW \) and \( YW \).

- Points \( X, Y, Z \) lie on a circle with center \( B \) and radius 5.0. Therefore, \( XB = YB = ZB = 5.0 \).

- We need to find the measure of \( \widehat{YXZ} \), which is the measure of the arc \( \overset{\frown}{YXZ} \).

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**

- Since \( X, Y, Z \) are on the circle centered at \( B \), \( \angle XBY \) is a central angle, and \( \overset{\frown}{XBY} = 96^\circ \).

- \( \angle XWY = 49^\circ \) is an angle formed by two chords \( XW \) and \( YW \).

**Step 3: Explore Geometric Relationships**

- The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts. However, \( \angle XWY \) is not necessarily an inscribed angle.

- To find \( \overset{\frown}{YXZ} \), we need to consider the entire circle and the known arcs.

**Step 4: Calculate the Measure of \( \overset{\frown}{YXZ} \)**

- The total measure of a circle is \( 360^\circ \).

- We know \( \overset{\frown}{XBY} = 96^\circ \).

- The arc \( \overset{\frown}{YXZ} \) is the remaining part of the circle when \( \overset{\frown}{XBY} \) is subtracted from \( 360^\circ \).

- Therefore, \( \overset{\frown}{YXZ} = 360^\circ - 96^\circ = 264^\circ \).

**Step 5: Verify and Reassess**

- We need to ensure that the calculation aligns with the given constraints and the nature of the circle.

- Since \( \angle XWY = 49^\circ \) is given, it might relate to the positioning of \( Z \) on the circle, but it does not directly affect the arc calculation.

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated measure of \( \overset{\frown}{YXZ} \) is \( 264^\circ \).

- We need to find the closest answer choice to \( 264^\circ \).

- The answer choices are:
  - A. 145
  - B. 166
  - C. 194
  - D. 215

- The closest value to \( 264^\circ \) is \( 215^\circ \).

**Step 7: Finalize the Solution**

- Based on the calculations and comparison, the closest answer choice to \( 264^\circ \) is \( 215^\circ \).

</think>

**Solution:**

To find the measure of \( \widehat{YXZ} \), we calculated the remaining arc of the circle after subtracting the given arc \( \overset{\frown}{XBY} = 96^\circ \) from the total \( 360^\circ \), resulting in \( 264^\circ \). Comparing this with the provided answer choices, the closest value is \( 215^\circ \).
