**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- We have a geometric setup involving points A, D, E, and G.
- Angle DEA is 45 degrees.
- AE is 8 units long.
- Angle ADE is 30 degrees.
- G lies on line DE.
- Line GA is perpendicular to line GD.

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**

- Since angle ADE is 30 degrees and angle DEA is 45 degrees, angle DAE is 105 degrees (since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees).
- Triangle ADE is not a right triangle, but we can use trigonometry to find side lengths.

**Step 3: Apply Trigonometric Relationships**

- In triangle ADE, we can use the Law of Sines:
  \[
  \frac{AD}{\sin(45^\circ)} = \frac{8}{\sin(30^\circ)}
  \]
  \[
  \frac{AD}{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} = \frac{8}{\frac{1}{2}}
  \]
  \[
  AD \cdot \sqrt{2} = 16
  \]
  \[
  AD = \frac{16}{\sqrt{2}} = 8\sqrt{2}
  \]

**Step 4: Use Perpendicularity and Right Triangle Properties**

- Since GA is perpendicular to GD, triangle AGD is a right triangle.
- We need to find AG (x), which is the length of line AG.

**Step 5: Use Trigonometry in Right Triangle AGD**

- In triangle AGD, angle DAG is 45 degrees (since DEA is 45 degrees and GA is perpendicular to GD).
- Therefore, triangle AGD is a 45-45-90 triangle.
- In a 45-45-90 triangle, the legs are equal, and the hypotenuse is \(\sqrt{2}\) times the length of a leg.

**Step 6: Calculate AG (x)**

- Since AD = \(8\sqrt{2}\) and triangle AGD is a 45-45-90 triangle:
  \[
  AG = \frac{AD}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{8\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = 8
  \]

**Step 7: Verify and Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated length of AG (x) is 8.
- Compare this with the given answer choices:
  - A. 4
  - B. \(4\sqrt{2}\)
  - C. \(4\sqrt{3}\)
  - D. 8

- The calculated value matches choice D.

<Solution>

Based on the analysis and calculations, the length of line AG (x) is 8. This matches answer choice D.
