1. **Analyzing the Problem:**
   - We have a geometric problem involving distances between three cities: Des Moines (A), Phoenix (B), and Atlanta (C).
   - The total distance of the round trip from Des Moines to Phoenix, then to Atlanta, and back to Des Moines is 3482 miles.
   - We are given the following expressions for the distances:
     - \( AC = 73.8x \)
     - \( AB = 150x + 91 \)
     - \( BC = 110x + 53 \)

2. **Identifying What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the distance from Phoenix (B) to Atlanta (C), which is \( BC = 110x + 53 \).

3. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   - The total distance for the trip is the sum of the distances for each leg of the journey:
     \[
     AB + BC + CA = 3482
     \]
   - Substituting the given expressions:
     \[
     (150x + 91) + (110x + 53) + 73.8x = 3482
     \]

4. **Simplifying the Equation:**
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     150x + 110x + 73.8x + 91 + 53 = 3482
     \]
     \[
     333.8x + 144 = 3482
     \]

5. **Solving for \( x \):**
   - Subtract 144 from both sides:
     \[
     333.8x = 3338
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 333.8 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{3338}{333.8} \approx 10
     \]

6. **Calculating \( BC \):**
   - Substitute \( x = 10 \) into the expression for \( BC \):
     \[
     BC = 110x + 53 = 110(10) + 53 = 1100 + 53 = 1153
     \]

7. **Comparing with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated distance \( BC = 1153 \) does not exactly match any of the given choices.
   - We need to select the closest answer from the choices: A. 53, B. 73.8, C. 110, D. 1591.
   - The closest value to 1153 is 1591.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the calculations, the closest answer choice to the calculated distance is D. 1591.
</think>

<Solution>
- We derived the equation for the total trip distance and solved for \( x \).
- Substituting \( x \) back into the expression for \( BC \), we found \( BC = 1153 \).
- Comparing this with the given answer choices, the closest value is 1591.
- Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: D
