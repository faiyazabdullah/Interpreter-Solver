**Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Constraints**

- We have four points: \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \).
- Points \( A, B, \) and \( D \) lie on the circle centered at \( C \) with radius 2.0.
- Line \( AB \) passes through point \( C \).
- We are given that \( \text{MeasureOf}(\angle BDA) = \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 2) \).

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**

- Since \( A, B, \) and \( D \) lie on the circle centered at \( C \), \( CA = CB = CD = 2.0 \).
- \( C \) lies on line \( AB \), meaning \( C \) is between \( A \) and \( B \) on the line.
- \( \angle BDA \) is an angle subtended by the arc \( BA \) at point \( D \).

**Step 3: Brainstorm New Ideas**

- Consider the properties of circles and angles:
  - The angle subtended by an arc at the center of the circle is twice the angle subtended at any point on the circumference.
  - Since \( C \) is on line \( AB \), \( \angle ACB \) is a straight angle (180 degrees).

**Step 4: Apply Geometric Theorems**

- Since \( C \) is the center of the circle, \( \angle ACB = 180^\circ \).
- \( \angle BDA \) is an inscribed angle subtended by arc \( BA \).
- The central angle \( \angle BCA \) subtended by the same arc \( BA \) is \( 180^\circ \).

**Step 5: Calculate the Inscribed Angle**

- The inscribed angle \( \angle BDA \) is half of the central angle \( \angle BCA \).
- Therefore, \( \angle BDA = \frac{1}{2} \times 180^\circ = 90^\circ \).

**Step 6: Verify and Refine**

- The calculation shows \( \angle BDA = 90^\circ \).
- Since \( \text{MeasureOf}(\angle BDA) = \text{MeasureOf}(\angle 2) \), \( \angle 2 = 90^\circ \).

**Step 7: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated measure of \( \angle 2 \) is \( 90^\circ \).
- Among the answer choices, \( 90^\circ \) corresponds to option D.

**Step 8: Finalize the Solution**

- The closest and exact match to our calculated result is option D.

**Solution:**

Given the constraints and calculations, the measure of \( \angle 2 \) is \( 90^\circ \). Therefore, the correct answer is:
