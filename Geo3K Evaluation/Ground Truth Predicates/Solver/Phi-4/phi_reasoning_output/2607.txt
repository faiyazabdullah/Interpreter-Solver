1. **Analyzing the Given Constraints**:
   - Lengths of various lines are given:
     - \( EB = 5 \)
     - \( BC = 2x - 8 \)
     - \( DB = 3 \)
     - \( AB = x + 3 \)
   - Points \( B \) lies on both lines \( ED \) and \( AC \).
   - Lines \( EA \) and \( DC \) are parallel.

2. **Identifying What Needs to Be Found**:
   - We need to find the length of line \( BC \).

3. **Applying Geometric Properties and Theorems**:
   - Given that \( B \) lies on lines \( ED \) and \( AC \), and \( EA \parallel DC \), we can consider the properties of parallel lines and transversals.
   - Since \( B \) lies on both \( ED \) and \( AC \), and \( EA \parallel DC \), the segments \( EB \) and \( DB \) can be considered in relation to the segments \( AB \) and \( BC \).

4. **Setting Up Equations**:
   - Since \( B \) lies on line \( ED \), we have:
     \[
     EB + BD = ED
     \]
     Substituting the given values:
     \[
     5 + 3 = ED \implies ED = 8
     \]
   - Since \( B \) also lies on line \( AC \), we have:
     \[
     AB + BC = AC
     \]
     Substituting the given expressions:
     \[
     (x + 3) + (2x - 8) = AC
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     3x - 5 = AC
     \]

5. **Using Parallel Line Properties**:
   - Since \( EA \parallel DC \), and \( B \) lies on both transversals \( ED \) and \( AC \), we can use the properties of similar triangles or proportional segments.
   - The segments \( EB \) and \( DB \) are proportional to \( AB \) and \( BC \) due to the parallel lines:
     \[
     \frac{EB}{DB} = \frac{AB}{BC}
     \]
     Substituting the known values:
     \[
     \frac{5}{3} = \frac{x+3}{2x-8}
     \]

6. **Solving the Proportion**:
   - Cross-multiply to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     5(2x - 8) = 3(x + 3)
     \]
     \[
     10x - 40 = 3x + 9
     \]
     \[
     10x - 3x = 9 + 40
     \]
     \[
     7x = 49
     \]
     \[
     x = 7
     \]

7. **Finding \( BC \)**:
   - Substitute \( x = 7 \) into the expression for \( BC \):
     \[
     BC = 2x - 8 = 2(7) - 8 = 14 - 8 = 6
     \]

8. **Comparing with Answer Choices**:
   - The calculated length of \( BC \) is 6, which matches choice B.

9. **Verification**:
   - Reassess the calculations and ensure all steps align with the given constraints and geometric properties. The calculations are consistent and logical.

10. **Conclusion**:
    - The closest and correct answer choice is B.

</think>

**Solution**:
- We calculated \( BC = 6 \) by solving the proportion derived from the parallel line properties and the given segment lengths.
- The answer choice that matches this calculation is B.
