### Thought Section

1. **Analyze the Given Information**:
   - We have a quadrilateral with vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
   - The measures of angles are given as algebraic expressions in terms of \(x\) and \(y\).
   - To determine \(y\) such that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram, we need to use the property that opposite angles in a parallelogram are equal.

2. **Identify the Opposite Angles**:
   - \( \angle D, B, A \) and \( \angle A, C, D \) are opposite angles.
   - \( \angle B, A, C \) and \( \angle C, D, B \) are opposite angles.

3. **Set Up Equations for Opposite Angles**:
   - Since opposite angles in a parallelogram are equal:
     \[
     \text{Measure of } \angle D, B, A = \text{Measure of } \angle A, C, D
     \]
     \[
     6y + 16 = 7y + 2
     \]
   - Simplify this equation:
     \[
     6y + 16 = 7y + 2 \implies 16 - 2 = 7y - 6y \implies 14 = y
     \]

4. **Verify the Other Pair of Opposite Angles**:
   - Check the other pair of opposite angles:
     \[
     \text{Measure of } \angle B, A, C = \text{Measure of } \angle C, D, B
     \]
     \[
     6x + 14 = 8x - 8
     \]
   - Simplify this equation:
     \[
     6x + 14 = 8x - 8 \implies 14 + 8 = 8x - 6x \implies 22 = 2x \implies x = 11
     \]

5. **Check Consistency**:
   - Substitute \(y = 14\) back into the equations for the angles to ensure consistency:
     - \(\angle D, B, A = 6(14) + 16 = 84 + 16 = 100\)
     - \(\angle A, C, D = 7(14) + 2 = 98 + 2 = 100\)
   - Both angles are equal, confirming the property for a parallelogram.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The value \(y = 14\) satisfies the condition for the quadrilateral to be a parallelogram.
   - The calculations for \(x\) are consistent and do not affect the determination of \(y\).

7. **Compare with Answer Choices**:
   - The calculated value \(y = 14\) matches one of the given answer choices.

<Solution>
### Solution Section

The correct value of \(y\) that makes the quadrilateral a parallelogram is \(y = 14\). This satisfies the condition that opposite angles are equal. The calculations confirm that with \(y = 14\), the measures of opposite angles are indeed equal, fulfilling the requirement for the quadrilateral to be a parallelogram.
