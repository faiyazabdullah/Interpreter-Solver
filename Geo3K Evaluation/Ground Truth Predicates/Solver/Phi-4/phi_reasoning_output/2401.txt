### Thought Process

**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- We have three points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) with distances:
  - \( AB = 13 \)
  - \( BC = 13 \)
  - \( AC = 10 \)

- Point \( D \) lies on line \( AC \).
- Line \( BD \) is perpendicular to line \( DC \).

**Step 2: Visualize the Geometric Configuration**

- The distances \( AB = BC = 13 \) and \( AC = 10 \) suggest that triangle \( ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = BC \).
- Point \( D \) lies on \( AC \), and \( BD \) is perpendicular to \( DC \), indicating that \( D \) is the foot of the perpendicular from \( B \) to \( AC \).

**Step 3: Determine the Type of Triangle**

- Since \( AB = BC \) and \( AC \neq AB \), triangle \( ABC \) is isosceles but not equilateral.
- The perpendicular from \( B \) to \( AC \) suggests that \( D \) is the midpoint of \( AC \) if \( BD \) is the height.

**Step 4: Use the Pythagorean Theorem**

- In right triangle \( BDC \), apply the Pythagorean theorem:
  \[
  BD^2 + DC^2 = BC^2
  \]

- Let \( AD = x \) and \( DC = 10 - x \).

- Since \( BD \) is perpendicular to \( DC \), \( BD \) is the height from \( B \) to \( AC \).

**Step 5: Calculate \( BD \) and \( DC \)**

- Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle ABD \):
  \[
  BD^2 + x^2 = 13^2
  \]

- Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle BDC \):
  \[
  BD^2 + (10-x)^2 = 13^2
  \]

- Equate the two expressions for \( BD^2 \):
  \[
  169 - x^2 = 169 - (10-x)^2
  \]

- Simplify:
  \[
  x^2 = (10-x)^2
  \]

- Expanding and solving:
  \[
  x^2 = 100 - 20x + x^2
  \]
  \[
  0 = 100 - 20x
  \]
  \[
  20x = 100
  \]
  \[
  x = 5
  \]

- Thus, \( AD = 5 \) and \( DC = 5 \).

- Substitute \( x = 5 \) back to find \( BD \):
  \[
  BD^2 + 5^2 = 169
  \]
  \[
  BD^2 + 25 = 169
  \]
  \[
  BD^2 = 144
  \]
  \[
  BD = 12
  \]

**Step 6: Calculate the Area of Triangle \( BDC \)**

- The area of triangle \( BDC \) is:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times DC \times BD = \frac{1}{2} \times 5 \times 12 = 30
  \]

**Step 7: Calculate the Area of Triangle \( ABD \)**

- The area of triangle \( ABD \) is:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times BD = \frac{1}{2} \times 5 \times 12 = 30
  \]

**Step 8: Total Area of Quadrilateral \( ABDC \)**

- The total area of quadrilateral \( ABDC \) is the sum of the areas of triangles \( ABD \) and \( BDC \):
  \[
  \text{Total Area} = 30 + 30 = 60
  \]

**Step 9: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated area is 60, which matches answer choice B.

</think>

**Solution:**

The area of the figure \( ABDC \) is calculated by summing the areas of triangles \( ABD \) and \( BDC \), both of which have an area of 30. Therefore, the total area is 60.
