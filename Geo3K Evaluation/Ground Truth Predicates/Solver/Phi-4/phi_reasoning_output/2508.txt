**Step 1: Analyzing the Given Information**
- We have two line segments \( AB \) and \( AC \) with lengths \( 2x + 11 \) and \( 6x - 9 \) respectively.
- The angles \( \angle CAB \), \( \angle CBA \), and \( \angle ACB \) are all equal.

**Step 2: Summarizing Relevant Findings**
- Since \( \angle CAB = \angle CBA = \angle ACB \), triangle \( ABC \) is an equilateral triangle because all interior angles are equal.
- In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, so \( AB = AC = BC \).

**Step 3: Setting Up Equations**
- From the condition \( AB = AC \), we have:
  \[
  2x + 11 = 6x - 9
  \]

**Step 4: Solving the Equation**
- Rearrange the equation to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  2x + 11 = 6x - 9
  \]
  \[
  11 + 9 = 6x - 2x
  \]
  \[
  20 = 4x
  \]
  \[
  x = 5
  \]

**Step 5: Verification**
- Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the expressions for \( AB \) and \( AC \) to verify:
  \[
  AB = 2(5) + 11 = 10 + 11 = 21
  \]
  \[
  AC = 6(5) - 9 = 30 - 9 = 21
  \]
- Both lengths are equal, confirming that \( AB = AC \).

**Step 6: Reflection and Finalization**
- Since \( x = 5 \) satisfies the condition \( AB = AC \) and the triangle is equilateral, the solution is consistent with the given constraints.
- The calculated value \( x = 5 \) matches one of the provided answer choices.

<Solution>

Given the analysis and calculations, the value of \( x \) that satisfies all the geometric constraints is \( x = 5 \). This value ensures that the triangle \( ABC \) is equilateral, as required by the problem's conditions.
