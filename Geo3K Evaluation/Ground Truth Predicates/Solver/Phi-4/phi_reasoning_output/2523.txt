**Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints**
- We have several geometric constraints involving the lengths of various lines.
- Points \(A\), \(B\), \(D\), \(G\), and \(E\) are involved in these constraints.
- Key length relationships are given:
  - \( \text{Length of Line}(A, B) = x - 2 \)
  - \( \text{Length of Line}(G, D) = 7.5 \)
  - \( \text{Length of Line}(A, D) = x \)
  - \( \text{Length of Line}(E, B) = 5 \)

**Step 2: Understand Geometric Relationships**
- \(D\) lies on line \(AG\).
- \(B\) lies on line \(AE\).

**Step 3: Apply Geometric Theorems**
- The polygons are similar, indicating corresponding sides are proportional.
- From the problem, we have \(A\), \(B\), \(D\), \(G\), and \(E\) forming a geometric figure with lines sharing these points.
- Since \(D\) lies on \(AG\), and \(B\) lies on \(AE\), we can assume \(AD\) and \(AB\) are parts of the same line segments.

**Step 4: Set Up Proportions**
- Since \(D\) is on \(AG\), \(AD + DG = AG\).
- Since \(B\) is on \(AE\), \(AB + BE = AE\).

**Step 5: Use Given Lengths**
- From \( \text{Length of Line}(A, D) = x \) and \( \text{Length of Line}(G, D) = 7.5 \), we have \(AG = AD + DG = x + 7.5\).
- From \( \text{Length of Line}(A, B) = x - 2 \) and \( \text{Length of Line}(E, B) = 5 \), we have \(AE = AB + BE = (x - 2) + 5 = x + 3\).

**Step 6: Establish Proportionality**
- Since the polygons are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides should be equal:
  \[
  \frac{AD}{AG} = \frac{AB}{AE}
  \]
  Substituting the known lengths:
  \[
  \frac{x}{x + 7.5} = \frac{x - 2}{x + 3}
  \]

**Step 7: Solve the Equation**
- Cross-multiply to solve for \(x\):
  \[
  x(x + 3) = (x - 2)(x + 7.5)
  \]
  \[
  x^2 + 3x = x^2 + 7.5x - 2x - 15
  \]
  \[
  x^2 + 3x = x^2 + 5.5x - 15
  \]
  \[
  3x = 5.5x - 15
  \]
  \[
  15 = 5.5x - 3x
  \]
  \[
  15 = 2.5x
  \]
  \[
  x = \frac{15}{2.5} = 6
  \]

**Step 8: Verify and Select the Closest Answer**
- The calculated value of \(x\) is 6.
- Compare with the given answer choices: A. 2, B. 3, C. 5, D. 6.
- The closest and exact match is D. 6.

**Solution:**

By solving the proportion equation derived from the similarity of the polygons and the given constraints, we find that \(x = 6\). This value matches one of the provided answer choices.
