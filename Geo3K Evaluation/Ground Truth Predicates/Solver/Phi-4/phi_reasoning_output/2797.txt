**Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Constraints**

- We have three lines: Line(T, R), Line(R, S), and Line(T, S).
- Points L and W lie on these lines, with L on Line(T, R) and W on Line(R, S).
- Line(T, S) is parallel to Line(L, W).

**Step 2: Identify Given Measurements**

- \( RL = 5 \)
- \( RT = 9 \)
- \( WS = 6 \)

**Step 3: Determine What Needs to be Found**

- We need to find \( RW \).

**Step 4: Apply Geometric Theorems and Properties**

- Since Line(T, S) is parallel to Line(L, W), and L lies on Line(T, R) while W lies on Line(R, S), we can use properties of similar triangles or parallel lines.
- Consider triangles formed by these points and lines. Since Line(T, S) is parallel to Line(L, W), triangles \( \triangle TRS \) and \( \triangle LWR \) are similar by the Basic Proportionality Theorem (also known as Thales' theorem).

**Step 5: Set Up Proportions Using Similar Triangles**

- From the similarity of triangles \( \triangle TRS \) and \( \triangle LWR \), we have:
  \[
  \frac{RL}{RT} = \frac{RW}{RS}
  \]

- We know \( RL = 5 \) and \( RT = 9 \).

- We need to express \( RS \) in terms of known quantities. Since \( WS = 6 \) and \( W \) is on Line(R, S), we have:
  \[
  RS = RW + WS = RW + 6
  \]

**Step 6: Solve the Proportion**

- Substitute the known values into the proportion:
  \[
  \frac{5}{9} = \frac{RW}{RW + 6}
  \]

- Cross-multiply to solve for \( RW \):
  \[
  5(RW + 6) = 9RW
  \]

- Distribute and simplify:
  \[
  5RW + 30 = 9RW
  \]

- Rearrange to solve for \( RW \):
  \[
  30 = 9RW - 5RW
  \]
  \[
  30 = 4RW
  \]
  \[
  RW = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5
  \]

**Step 7: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated \( RW = 7.5 \).
- Compare this with the answer choices: A. 5.4, B. 6, C. 6.6, D. 7.5.

**Step 8: Select the Closest Answer**

- The calculated value \( RW = 7.5 \) matches choice D.

**Step 9: Final Verification**

- Reassess the steps and calculations to ensure no errors were made.
- The use of similar triangles and parallel line properties was correctly applied.

**Solution**

Given the geometric constraints and the application of similar triangles, we found \( RW = 7.5 \). This matches choice D.
