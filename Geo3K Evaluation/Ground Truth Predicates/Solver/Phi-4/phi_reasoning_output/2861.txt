### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information

- We have a set of angle measures and relationships defined by points and lines.
- Key parallel lines: Line \( E, B \) is parallel to line \( A, F \).
- Key intersections and points lying on lines are provided.
- We need to find angles supplementary to \( \angle 1 \).

### Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings

- Supplementary angles sum to \( 180^\circ \).
- \( \angle 1 \) is formed by points \( N, D, E \).
- Identify lines and angles related to \( \angle 1 \) using parallel line properties.

### Step 3: Apply Geometric Theorems

- **Corresponding Angles Postulate**: If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal.
- **Alternate Interior Angles Theorem**: If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, alternate interior angles are equal.
- **Linear Pair Postulate**: If two angles form a linear pair, they are supplementary.

### Step 4: Explore Angle Relationships

- **Line \( E, B \) and Line \( A, F \)** are parallel, and line \( D, N, G \) acts as a transversal.
- **Identify Corresponding Angles**:
  - \( \angle 3 \) (formed by \( E, D, C \)) is corresponding to \( \angle 1 \).
  - **Supplementary to \( \angle 1 \)**: \( \angle 3 \) (since they form a linear pair on line \( D, N, G \)).

- **Identify Alternate Interior Angles**:
  - \( \angle 4 \) (formed by \( C, D, B \)) is alternate interior to \( \angle 1 \).
  - **Supplementary to \( \angle 1 \)**: \( \angle 4 \).

- **Identify Other Supplementary Angles**:
  - \( \angle 2 \) (formed by \( B, D, N \)) is a linear pair with \( \angle 4 \) on line \( B, D, N \).
  - \( \angle 2 \) is supplementary to \( \angle 4 \), and thus supplementary to \( \angle 1 \).

### Step 5: Verify and Refine

- **Check Remaining Angles**:
  - \( \angle 7 \) (formed by \( A, C, G \)) is corresponding to \( \angle 3 \) (since \( C, D, G \) and \( C, N, G \) are collinear).
  - \( \angle 7 \) is supplementary to \( \angle 3 \), and thus supplementary to \( \angle 1 \).

### Step 6: Reassess and Reflect

- **List of Supplementary Angles to \( \angle 1 \)**:
  - \( \angle 2 \), \( \angle 3 \), \( \angle 4 \), and \( \angle 7 \).

### Step 7: Compare with Answer Choices

- **Answer Choices**:
  - A. angles 2, 3, 6, and 7
  - B. angles 2, 3, and 4
  - C. angles 3, 4, 7, and 8
  - D. angles 4, 5, and 8

- **Closest Match**: B. angles 2, 3, and 4

### Step 8: Finalize the Solution

- Based on the analysis, the angles supplementary to \( \angle 1 \) are \( \angle 2 \), \( \angle 3 \), and \( \angle 4 \).

Solution section:
The angles supplementary to \( \angle 1 \) are \( \angle 2 \), \( \angle 3 \), and \( \angle 4 \). Therefore, the correct answer choice is B.

Final Answer: B
