**Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints**

- We are given three angle measures:
  - \( \angle(X, Y, B) = \angle(1) \)
  - \( \angle(Z, Y, X) = \angle(2) \)
  - \( \angle(A, Y, Z) = \angle(3) \)
- We are also given that point \( Y \) lies on line \( AB \).

**Step 2: Understand the Question**

- We need to determine which condition would prove that line \( d \) is parallel to line \( XZ \).

**Step 3: Identify Relevant Geometric Theorems**

- To prove lines are parallel, we can use the concept of corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, or consecutive interior angles being congruent or supplementary.

**Step 4: Analyze Each Answer Choice**

- **Choice A: \( \angle 1 \cong \angle 3 \)**
  - If \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 3 \) are congruent, and considering the configuration, this could imply that \( \angle(X, Y, B) \) and \( \angle(A, Y, Z) \) are corresponding angles or alternate interior angles with respect to line \( d \) and line \( XZ \). If these angles are congruent, it suggests that line \( d \) is parallel to line \( XZ \).

- **Choice B: \( \angle 1 \cong \angle Z \)**
  - \( \angle Z \) is not directly related to the configuration of lines \( d \) and \( XZ \) in a way that would imply parallelism through known theorems.

- **Choice C: \( \angle 2 \cong \angle X \)**
  - \( \angle X \) is not directly related to the configuration of lines \( d \) and \( XZ \) in a way that would imply parallelism through known theorems.

- **Choice D: \( \angle 3 \cong \angle Z \)**
  - Similar to Choice B, \( \angle Z \) does not directly relate to the configuration of lines \( d \) and \( XZ \) in a way that would imply parallelism.

**Step 5: Verify and Reflect**

- Reassess the geometric configuration and the implications of each angle congruence.
- Choice A is the only one that directly relates two angles that could be corresponding or alternate interior angles with respect to the lines \( d \) and \( XZ \).

**Step 6: Conclusion**

- Based on the analysis, Choice A provides a condition that directly implies parallelism through the congruence of angles that could be corresponding or alternate interior angles.

**Solution**

To prove that line \( d \) is parallel to line \( XZ \), we need to establish a relationship between angles that are either corresponding or alternate interior angles. Choice A states that \( \angle 1 \cong \angle 3 \). If these angles are corresponding or alternate interior angles with respect to lines \( d \) and \( XZ \), then line \( d \) is parallel to line \( XZ \).

Thus, the correct answer is:
