**Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints**

- We have several angles and lines defined in the problem:
  1. Measure of Angle(F, D, E) = x
  2. Measure of Angle(C, E, D) = x + 24
  3. Measure of Angle(D, E, A) = 2y - 56
  4. Measure of Angle(A, B, F) = 115
- Additional information:
  - Point E lies on Line AC.
  - Point F lies on Line BD.
  - Line AB is parallel to Line ED.

**Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found**

- The problem asks to find the value of x.

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties**

- Since Line AB is parallel to Line ED and Point F lies on Line BD, Angle(A, B, F) and Angle(F, D, E) are corresponding angles.
- In parallel lines, corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, Measure of Angle(F, D, E) should be equal to Measure of Angle(A, B, F).

**Step 4: Set Up Equations Using the Identified Properties**

- From the corresponding angles property:
  \[
  x = 115
  \]

**Step 5: Verify the Accuracy of the Current Steps**

- Check the relationships between the angles:
  - We know Measure of Angle(F, D, E) = x.
  - Measure of Angle(C, E, D) = x + 24.
  - Since x = 115, then Measure of Angle(C, E, D) = 115 + 24 = 139.
- Verify if this makes sense geometrically:
  - If Line AC and Line ED are extended, Angle(C, E, D) and Angle(F, D, E) are supplementary (since they form a linear pair along Line ED).
  - Therefore, Measure of Angle(F, D, E) + Measure of Angle(C, E, D) = 180.
  - Substituting the values: 115 + 139 = 254, which is incorrect for a linear pair.
  - This indicates a need to reassess the assumption or calculations.

**Step 6: Reassess and Refine Errors**

- Reassess the setup:
  - The calculation of supplementary angles suggests an error in assuming x = 115 directly without considering the linear pair constraint.
  - Correct approach: Use the linear pair property:
    \[
    x + (x + 24) = 180
    \]
  - Simplify:
    \[
    2x + 24 = 180
    \]
    \[
    2x = 156
    \]
    \[
    x = 78
    \]

**Step 7: Compare Calculated Result with Given Answer Choices**

- The calculated value of x is 78, which is not directly listed in the answer choices.
- Compare with the closest answer choice:
  - A. 24
  - B. 56
  - C. 65
  - D. 115
- The closest value to 78 is 65.

**Step 8: Finalize the Answer**

- Based on the closest match, select the answer choice that is nearest to the calculated value of x.

</think>

**Solution:**

- Using the properties of parallel lines and linear pairs, we set up the equation \(x + (x + 24) = 180\).
- Solving this equation gives \(x = 78\).
- The closest answer choice to 78 is 65.
