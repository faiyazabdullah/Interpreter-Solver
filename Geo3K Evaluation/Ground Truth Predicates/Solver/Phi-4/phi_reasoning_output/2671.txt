1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have two triangles: Triangle XYZ and Triangle JKL.
   - In Triangle XYZ:
     - Angle X is 51 degrees.
     - Length XY is 5.
     - Length YZ is 15.
     - Angle Y is equal to Angle KJL in Triangle JKL.
   - In Triangle JKL:
     - Angle J is 51 degrees.
     - Length JK is 4.
     - Length LK is x (what we need to find).

2. **Identify Known Relationships:**
   - Since Angle X and Angle J are both 51 degrees, and Angle Y = Angle KJL, the triangles might be similar by the Angle-Angle (AA) similarity postulate.
   - If the triangles are similar, the corresponding sides are proportional.

3. **Use the Similarity of Triangles:**
   - If triangles are similar, then:
     \[
     \frac{XY}{JK} = \frac{YZ}{KL} = \frac{XZ}{JL}
     \]
   - We know XY = 5, JK = 4, and YZ = 15. We need to find KL.

4. **Set Up Proportion Using Known Sides:**
   - Using the proportion \(\frac{XY}{JK} = \frac{YZ}{KL}\):
     \[
     \frac{5}{4} = \frac{15}{KL}
     \]

5. **Solve for KL:**
   - Cross-multiply to solve for KL:
     \[
     5 \times KL = 4 \times 15
     \]
     \[
     5 \times KL = 60
     \]
     \[
     KL = \frac{60}{5} = 12
     \]

6. **Verification:**
   - Check if the calculations align with the similarity conditions and given data.
   - The calculated KL = 12 fits the proportionality condition derived from the similarity of triangles.

7. **Select the Closest Answer Choice:**
   - The calculated length of KL is 12.
   - Among the answer choices, 12 corresponds to option C.

</think>
Solution:
By using the properties of similar triangles and the given geometric constraints, we determined that the length of KL is 12. This value fits the proportionality derived from the similarity of triangles XYZ and JKL. Therefore, the correct answer is:
