1. **Analyze the given geometric constraints:**
   - We have two equations for the length of the line segment \( UR \):
     - \( \text{LengthOf}(UR) = 3x \)
     - \( \text{LengthOf}(UR) = 7x - 44 \)
   - Points \( U \) and \( R \) both lie on the circle \( \odot P \) with a radius of 2.0.

2. **Identify what needs to be found:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies both equations for the length of \( UR \).

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - Since both expressions represent the same length, we can equate them:
     \[
     3x = 7x - 44
     \]

4. **Solve the equation for \( x \):**
   - Rearrange the equation:
     \[
     3x - 7x = -44
     \]
     \[
     -4x = -44
     \]
   - Divide both sides by \(-4\):
     \[
     x = \frac{-44}{-4} = 11
     \]

5. **Verify the solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 11 \) back into the original equations to ensure consistency:
     - For \( 3x \):
       \[
       3 \times 11 = 33
       \]
     - For \( 7x - 44 \):
       \[
       7 \times 11 - 44 = 77 - 44 = 33
       \]
   - Both expressions give the same length, confirming the solution is correct.

6. **Compare with answer choices:**
   - The calculated value of \( x \) is 11, which matches option B.

7. **Reassess and confirm:**
   - Re-evaluate the steps to ensure no calculation errors were made.
   - Confirm that the logical steps align with the problem constraints.

8. **Finalize the solution:**
   - The correct answer choice is B.
</think>

**Solution:**

Given the equations \( 3x = 7x - 44 \), solving for \( x \) yields:

\[
3x = 7x - 44 \\
3x - 7x = -44 \\
-4x = -44 \\
x = \frac{-44}{-4} = 11
\]

Substituting \( x = 11 \) into both expressions confirms they are equal, verifying the solution. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
