1. **Analyze the Given Constraints:**
   - We have a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) where \( \angle BAC \) is a right angle because \( \text{Line}(A, B) \) is perpendicular to \( \text{Line}(A, C) \).
   - The lengths of the sides are given as:
     - \( AC = 12 \)
     - \( BC = 25.5 \)
     - \( AB = x \) (to be determined)

2. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the length of \( AB \), denoted as \( x \).

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems:**
   - Since \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle BAC = 90^\circ \), we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
     \[
     AB^2 + AC^2 = BC^2
     \]

4. **Substitute Known Values into the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   - Substitute \( AC = 12 \) and \( BC = 25.5 \) into the equation:
     \[
     x^2 + 12^2 = 25.5^2
     \]

5. **Calculate the Squares:**
   - Calculate \( 12^2 \):
     \[
     12^2 = 144
     \]
   - Calculate \( 25.5^2 \):
     \[
     25.5^2 = 650.25
     \]

6. **Solve for \( x^2 \):**
   - Substitute the calculated values back into the equation:
     \[
     x^2 + 144 = 650.25
     \]
   - Solve for \( x^2 \):
     \[
     x^2 = 650.25 - 144 = 506.25
     \]

7. **Calculate \( x \):**
   - Take the square root of both sides to find \( x \):
     \[
     x = \sqrt{506.25}
     \]
   - Calculate \( \sqrt{506.25} \):
     \[
     x = 22.5
     \]

8. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated value of \( x \) is 22.5, which matches answer choice A.

9. **Verify and Conclude:**
   - Reassess the calculations to ensure no errors were made.
   - The closest answer choice to the calculated value is indeed 22.5.

</think>

**Solution:**

Using the Pythagorean theorem for the right triangle \( \triangle ABC \), we calculated:

\[
x^2 = 650.25 - 144 = 506.25
\]

Taking the square root gives:

\[
x = \sqrt{506.25} = 22.5
\]

Comparing with the answer choices, the closest value is 22.5, which corresponds to option A.
