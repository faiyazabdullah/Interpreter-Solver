### Thought Process

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the side length of a square inscribed in a circle with an area of \(18\pi\) square units.

2. **Key Geometric Insight:**
   - A square inscribed in a circle has its diagonal equal to the diameter of the circle.

3. **Calculate the Radius of the Circle:**
   - The area of the circle is given by \( \pi r^2 = 18\pi \).
   - Solving for \( r \), we have:
     \[
     r^2 = 18 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}
     \]

4. **Find the Diameter of the Circle:**
   - The diameter \( d \) is twice the radius:
     \[
     d = 2r = 2 \times 3\sqrt{2} = 6\sqrt{2}
     \]

5. **Relate the Diameter to the Square:**
   - The diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle, so:
     \[
     \text{Diagonal of the square} = 6\sqrt{2}
     \]

6. **Use the Diagonal to Find the Side Length:**
   - For a square with side length \( s \), the diagonal \( d \) is given by:
     \[
     d = s\sqrt{2}
     \]
   - Set the diagonal equal to \( 6\sqrt{2} \):
     \[
     s\sqrt{2} = 6\sqrt{2}
     \]
   - Solving for \( s \):
     \[
     s = 6
     \]

7. **Verification:**
   - Check if \( s = 6 \) matches any of the answer choices:
     - \( s = 6 \) corresponds to option C.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The calculations confirm that the side length of the square is 6, which matches option C.

### Solution
Based on the calculations and geometric relationships, the side length of the square inscribed in the circle is 6 units. Therefore, the correct answer is:
