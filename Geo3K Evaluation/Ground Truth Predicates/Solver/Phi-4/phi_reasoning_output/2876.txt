**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

We are given several geometric constraints involving points and lines:
- Points \(E\), \(D\), \(F\) lie on lines \(AC\), \(AB\), and \(DC\) respectively.
- Point \(F\) also lies on lines \(BE\) and \(DC\).

We also have the following geometric similarity and measurements:
- \(\triangle DEF \sim \triangle CBF\)
- Perimeter of \(\triangle CBF = 27\)
- \(DF = 6\)
- \(FC = 8\)

**Step 2: Understand the Problem**

We need to find the perimeter of \(\triangle DEF\). Since \(\triangle DEF \sim \triangle CBF\), their corresponding sides are proportional. We will use this similarity to find the scale factor and then determine the lengths of the sides of \(\triangle DEF\).

**Step 3: Use Similarity to Find Scale Factor**

Since \(\triangle DEF \sim \triangle CBF\), the ratio of corresponding sides is constant. Let the scale factor be \(k\).

From the similarity, we have:
\[
\frac{DF}{FC} = k \implies \frac{6}{8} = k \implies k = \frac{3}{4}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the Perimeter of \(\triangle DEF\)**

The perimeter of \(\triangle CBF\) is 27. The sides of \(\triangle CBF\) are proportional to the sides of \(\triangle DEF\) by the factor \(k = \frac{3}{4}\).

Thus, the perimeter of \(\triangle DEF\) is:
\[
\text{Perimeter of } \triangle DEF = k \times \text{Perimeter of } \triangle CBF = \frac{3}{4} \times 27 = 20.25
\]

**Step 5: Verify and Compare**

We calculated the perimeter of \(\triangle DEF\) to be 20.25. We need to compare this with the given answer choices:
- A. 20.25
- B. 21
- C. 27
- D. 36

The calculated perimeter matches option A.

**Step 6: Finalize the Answer**

The closest and exact match to our calculated perimeter is option A.

**Solution**

By using the properties of similar triangles, we determined the scale factor between \(\triangle DEF\) and \(\triangle CBF\) to be \(\frac{3}{4}\). We then calculated the perimeter of \(\triangle DEF\) as \(20.25\) using this scale factor and the given perimeter of \(\triangle CBF\). The correct answer choice that matches our calculation is:
