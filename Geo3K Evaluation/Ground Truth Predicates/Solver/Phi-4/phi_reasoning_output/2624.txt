### Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints

- We have two angles, \(\angle 10\) and \(\angle 9\), with their measures expressed in terms of \(x\).
- \(\angle BCD\) is equal to \(\angle 10\), and \(\angle BCE\) is equal to \(\angle 9\).
- Point \(C\) lies on line \(AB\) and line \(DE\).

### Step 2: Understand the Relationship Between the Angles

- Since point \(C\) lies on both lines \(AB\) and \(DE\), it suggests that lines \(AB\) and \(DE\) intersect at point \(C\).
- The angles \(\angle BCD\) and \(\angle BCE\) are likely to be a pair of adjacent angles formed by the intersection of lines \(AB\) and \(DE\).

### Step 3: Summarize the Given Information

- \(m \angle 9 = 2x - 4\)
- \(m \angle 10 = 2x + 4\)

### Step 4: Apply Geometric Theorems

- Since \(\angle BCD\) and \(\angle BCE\) are adjacent angles formed by the intersection of two lines, they are supplementary. This means:
  \[
  m \angle 9 + m \angle 10 = 180^\circ
  \]

### Step 5: Set Up the Equation

- Substitute the expressions for the angles:
  \[
  (2x - 4) + (2x + 4) = 180
  \]

### Step 6: Solve the Equation

- Simplify the equation:
  \[
  2x - 4 + 2x + 4 = 180
  \]
  \[
  4x = 180
  \]
- Solve for \(x\):
  \[
  x = \frac{180}{4} = 45
  \]

### Step 7: Find the Measure of \(\angle 10\)

- Substitute \(x = 45\) into the expression for \(m \angle 10\):
  \[
  m \angle 10 = 2x + 4 = 2(45) + 4 = 90 + 4 = 94
  \]

### Step 8: Compare with Answer Choices

- The calculated measure of \(\angle 10\) is \(94\).
- Compare this with the given answer choices: A. 86, B. 94, C. 98, D. 104.
- The closest and exact match is option B.

### Step 9: Reflect and Confirm

- Reassess the calculations and logic: The setup and solution steps are consistent with the geometric properties and given equations.
- Verify that the supplementary angle relationship was correctly applied and solved.

**Solution**

Based on the analysis and calculations, the measure of \(\angle 10\) is found to be \(94^\circ\). This matches option B.
