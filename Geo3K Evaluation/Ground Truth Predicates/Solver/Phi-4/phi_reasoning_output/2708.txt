**Step 1: Analyze the given geometric constraints**

- We have \( \text{LengthOf(Line}(A, C)) = 3.2 \).
- \( \text{LengthOf(Line}(A, B)) = \text{LengthOf(Line}(A, C)) = 3.2 \).
- \( \text{LengthOf(Line}(C, D)) = \text{LengthOf(Line}(A, B)) = 3.2 \).
- \( \text{LengthOf(Line}(B, D)) = \text{LengthOf(Line}(C, D)) = 3.2 \).
- \( \text{Line}(C, D) \) is perpendicular to \( \text{Line}(C, A) \).

**Step 2: Visualize the geometric configuration**

Given these constraints, we can deduce that points \( A, B, C, D \) form a geometric figure where:

- \( AB = AC = CD = BD = 3.2 \).
- \( CD \perp CA \).

This suggests a kite or a rhombus configuration, but since \( AB = CD \) and \( AD = BC \) (since \( BD = CD = 3.2 \)), it is likely a rhombus.

**Step 3: Confirm the figure is a rhombus**

In a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals are perpendicular. Here, \( AC \) and \( BD \) can be considered as diagonals of the rhombus since they intersect at right angles.

**Step 4: Calculate the area of the rhombus**

The area \( A \) of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula involving its diagonals:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2
\]

where \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \) are the lengths of the diagonals.

**Step 5: Determine the lengths of the diagonals**

- \( AC = 3.2 \) (given).
- Since \( CD \perp CA \) and \( CD = 3.2 \), \( BD \) must also be \( 3.2 \) because \( BD = CD \).

Thus, the diagonals \( AC \) and \( BD \) are both \( 3.2 \).

**Step 6: Calculate the area using the diagonals**

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times 3.2 \times 3.2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 10.24 = 5.12
\]

**Step 7: Reassess the configuration**

Upon reassessment, note that the diagonals \( AC \) and \( BD \) are not the full diagonals of the rhombus. Since \( CD \perp CA \) and all sides are equal, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles.

The diagonals of a rhombus split each other into two equal parts. Therefore, if \( AC = 3.2 \), then each half is \( 1.6 \). Similarly, \( BD = 3.2 \), so each half is \( 1.6 \).

The full diagonals are:

- \( d_1 = 2 \times 1.6 = 3.2 \)
- \( d_2 = 2 \times 1.6 = 3.2 \)

Recalculate the area:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times 6.4 \times 3.2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 20.48 = 10.24
\]

**Step 8: Round to the nearest tenth**

The area rounded to the nearest tenth is \( 10.2 \).

**Step 9: Compare with answer choices**

The closest answer choice is \( 10.2 \).

Final Answer: C

</think>

**Solution**

Given the constraints and analysis, the area of the parallelogram (rhombus) is calculated using the diagonals. The diagonals \( AC \) and \( BD \) are both \( 6.4 \) when considering the full length. The area is:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times 6.4 \times 3.2 = 10.24
\]

Rounded to the nearest tenth, the area is \( 10.2 \).
