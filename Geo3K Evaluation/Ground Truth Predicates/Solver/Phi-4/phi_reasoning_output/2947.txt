**Step 1: Understand the Problem Statement and Constraints**

We are given a triangle with vertices A, B, and C. The following information is provided:
- Length of line segment AB is \( x \).
- Length of line segment BC is \( 18\sqrt{3} \).
- Measure of angle BAC is 45 degrees.
- Length of line segment AC is \( 18\sqrt{3} \).
- Line CA is perpendicular to line CB.

**Step 2: Summarize the Geometry**

From the given constraints, we have:
- \( \angle BAC = 45^\circ \)
- \( AC \perp BC \) implies \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \)

This means triangle ABC is a right triangle with \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \) and \( \angle BAC = 45^\circ \). Since the angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees, \( \angle ABC \) must be \( 45^\circ \). Therefore, triangle ABC is a 45-45-90 triangle.

**Step 3: Properties of a 45-45-90 Triangle**

In a 45-45-90 triangle, the legs are equal in length, and the hypotenuse is \( \sqrt{2} \) times the length of each leg. 

Let's denote:
- \( AC = BC = 18\sqrt{3} \) (since AC and BC are legs of the 45-45-90 triangle and equal).
- \( AB \) is the hypotenuse.

Using the properties of a 45-45-90 triangle:
\[ AB = AC \times \sqrt{2} = 18\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{2} \]

**Step 4: Calculate \( AB \)**

Calculate \( AB \):
\[
AB = 18\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{2} = 18 \times \sqrt{3 \times 2} = 18 \times \sqrt{6}
\]

Thus, the length of \( AB \), which is \( x \), is \( 18\sqrt{6} \).

**Step 5: Verify and Compare with Answer Choices**

We have calculated \( x = 18\sqrt{6} \). Now, let's compare this with the given answer choices:
- A. \( 9\sqrt{6} \)
- B. \( 18\sqrt{6} \)
- C. 54
- D. \( 36\sqrt{3} \)

The calculated \( x = 18\sqrt{6} \) matches exactly with choice B.

**Step 6: Finalize the Answer**

Based on the calculations and comparison, the correct answer is B.

</think>

**Solution:**

The triangle ABC is a 45-45-90 triangle with legs \( AC = BC = 18\sqrt{3} \). The hypotenuse \( AB \) is calculated as:
\[ AB = 18\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{2} = 18\sqrt{6} \]

Comparing this result with the given answer choices, we find that the correct choice is \( 18\sqrt{6} \), which corresponds to option B.

Final Answer: B
