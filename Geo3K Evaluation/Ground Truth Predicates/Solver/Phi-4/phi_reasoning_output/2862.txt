**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

We are given the measures of four angles in a geometric figure involving points X, W, Z, and Y. The angles are:
- \( \angle(X, W, Z) = 3x \)
- \( \angle(W, Z, Y) = 4x \)
- \( \angle(Y, X, W) = x \)
- \( \angle(Z, Y, X) = 2x \)

We need to find the measure of \( \angle W \).

**Step 2: Summarize the Geometric Context**

These angles are likely part of a closed geometric figure, such as a quadrilateral, because they involve four distinct points. In a quadrilateral, the sum of the interior angles is \(360^\circ\).

**Step 3: Set Up the Equation**

Using the property of quadrilaterals, we can write the equation for the sum of the angles:
\[
3x + 4x + x + 2x = 360^\circ
\]

**Step 4: Solve for \(x\)**

Combine the terms:
\[
10x = 360^\circ
\]

Divide both sides by 10 to solve for \(x\):
\[
x = 36^\circ
\]

**Step 5: Determine \( \angle W \)**

We need to identify which angle corresponds to \( \angle W \). Since \( \angle W \) is not directly given, we need to consider the context. The angles are given in terms of their positions around the points, and \( \angle W \) is likely one of these angles.

From the given angles, \( \angle(W, Z, Y) = 4x \) involves point W. Therefore, \( \angle W \) is \( 4x \).

**Step 6: Calculate \( \angle W \)**

Substitute \( x = 36^\circ \) into \( 4x \):
\[
\angle W = 4 \times 36^\circ = 144^\circ
\]

**Step 7: Compare with Answer Choices**

The calculated measure of \( \angle W \) is \( 144^\circ \). None of the answer choices directly match \( 144^\circ \). We need to select the closest option.

**Step 8: Select the Closest Answer**

The answer choices are:
- A. 18
- B. 27
- C. 54
- D. 108

The closest value to \( 144^\circ \) is \( 108^\circ \).

**Step 9: Final Decision**

Given the instructions to select the closest answer, the best choice is D. 108.

</think>

**Solution:**

1. Recognize the sum of angles in a quadrilateral is \(360^\circ\).
2. Set up the equation: \(3x + 4x + x + 2x = 360^\circ\).
3. Solve for \(x\): \(10x = 360^\circ\) gives \(x = 36^\circ\).
4. Identify \( \angle W \) as \(4x\), which is \(4 \times 36^\circ = 144^\circ\).
5. Compare \(144^\circ\) with the answer choices.
6. Select the closest answer: D. 108.

Final Answer: D
