### Thought Section

1. **Analyzing the Given Information:**
   - We have a triangle \( \triangle PQR \) with points \( S \) and \( T \).
   - \( S \) lies on line \( PR \) and \( T \) lies on line \( PQ \).
   - The line \( ST \) is parallel to line \( QR \) (i.e., \( ST \parallel QR \)).
   - Given lengths are \( PS = 12.5 \), \( SR = 5 \), and \( PT = 15 \).
   - We need to find \( TQ \).

2. **Using the Basic Proportionality Theorem (Thales' Theorem):**
   - Since \( ST \parallel QR \), by the Basic Proportionality Theorem, the segments are proportional:
     \[
     \frac{PS}{SR} = \frac{PT}{TQ}
     \]
   - Substitute the known values into the proportion:
     \[
     \frac{12.5}{5} = \frac{15}{TQ}
     \]

3. **Solving the Proportion:**
   - Simplify the left side of the equation:
     \[
     \frac{12.5}{5} = 2.5
     \]
   - Set up the equation:
     \[
     2.5 = \frac{15}{TQ}
     \]
   - Solve for \( TQ \) by cross-multiplying:
     \[
     2.5 \times TQ = 15
     \]
     \[
     TQ = \frac{15}{2.5}
     \]

4. **Calculating \( TQ \):**
   - Perform the division:
     \[
     TQ = 6
     \]

5. **Verification and Comparison:**
   - The calculated value of \( TQ \) is 6.
   - Compare this result with the given answer choices: A. 5, B. 6, C. 6.5, D. 12.5.
   - The calculated value matches choice B.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The calculations and logic confirm that the correct answer is choice B.

### Solution Section
Based on the application of the Basic Proportionality Theorem and solving the resulting proportion, the length of \( TQ \) is calculated to be 6. This matches the answer choice B. Therefore, the final answer is:
