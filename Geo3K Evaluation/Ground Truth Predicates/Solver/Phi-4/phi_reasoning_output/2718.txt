**Step 1: Analyze the given geometric constraints.**
- We are given several angle measures and relationships:
  - Measure of \(\angle FDG\) is equal to \(\text{angle 2}\).
  - Measure of \(\angle DEF = 25^\circ\).
  - Measure of \(\angle GDE = \text{angle 1}\).
  - Measure of \(\angle EFD = 65^\circ\).
  - Point G lies on line EF.
  - Line GE is perpendicular to line GD.

**Step 2: Identify what needs to be found.**
- We need to determine the measure of \(\angle 1\), which is \(\angle GDE\).

**Step 3: Apply relevant geometric theorems and properties.**
- Since line GE is perpendicular to line GD, \(\angle GED = 90^\circ\).
- In triangle \(\triangle GDE\), the sum of the interior angles must be \(180^\circ\).

**Step 4: Calculate the unknown angle using the known angles.**
- We know:
  - \(\angle GED = 90^\circ\)
  - \(\angle DEF = 25^\circ\)
- Since point G lies on line EF, \(\angle EFD = 65^\circ\) is not directly in \(\triangle GDE\), but \(\angle EFD\) helps confirm the orientation of the points.
- In \(\triangle GDE\):
  \[
  \angle GDE + \angle GED + \angle DEG = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  \angle 1 + 90^\circ + 25^\circ = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  \angle 1 + 115^\circ = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  \angle 1 = 180^\circ - 115^\circ = 65^\circ
  \]

**Step 5: Verify calculations and compare with answer choices.**
- The calculated measure of \(\angle 1\) is \(65^\circ\).
- Compare this with the given answer choices:
  - A. 25
  - B. 55
  - C. 65
  - D. 75
- The calculated value matches option C.

**Step 6: Finalize the solution.**
- Based on the calculations and the given constraints, the measure of \(\angle 1\) is \(65^\circ\), which corresponds to option C.

</think>

**Solution:**
Using the geometric constraints and properties, we calculated the measure of \(\angle 1\) in \(\triangle GDE\) to be \(65^\circ\). This matches the answer choice C.
