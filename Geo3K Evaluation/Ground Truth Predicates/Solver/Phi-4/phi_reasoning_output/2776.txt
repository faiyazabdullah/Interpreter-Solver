**Step 1: Analyze Given Information**
- Quadrilateral ABCD is a rectangle. This means all angles are 90 degrees, and opposite sides are equal.
- Point E lies on both line BC and line AD. Therefore, E is the intersection point of these lines.
- Line BD is perpendicular to line BA. Since ABCD is a rectangle, line BD is a diagonal and perpendicular to line BA means AB is parallel to CD and AD is parallel to BC.
- Given angle measures: m∠2 = 40.

**Step 2: Summarize Relevant Findings**
- As ABCD is a rectangle, all internal angles are 90 degrees.
- Diagonal BD divides the rectangle into two congruent right triangles, ABD and CBD.
- Since line BD is perpendicular to line BA, it confirms that triangle ABD is a right triangle with ∠ABD = 90°.
- Given m∠2 = 40°, and since E lies on line AD and line BC, E is the intersection point of the diagonals.
- We need to find m∠8, which is ∠C, E, D.

**Step 3: Brainstorm New Ideas**
- Since E is the intersection of diagonals, and diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other, E is the midpoint of both diagonals.
- In right triangle CED (formed by diagonal CE and side CD), we know:
  - ∠CED = 90° (since diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other at right angles).
  - m∠2 = 40°, which is ∠EAB.
  - ∠EAB and ∠CDE are alternate interior angles, so m∠CDE = 40°.

**Step 4: Verify Accuracy of Current Steps**
- Since ∠CDE = 40° and ∠CED = 90°, we can find ∠8 (which is ∠C, E, D) using the angle sum property of a triangle:
  - In triangle CED, the sum of angles is 180°.
  - m∠C, E, D + m∠CDE + m∠CED = 180°.
  - m∠C, E, D + 40° + 90° = 180°.
  - m∠C, E, D = 180° - 130° = 50°.

**Step 5: Refine Any Errors**
- Reassess calculations and logical deductions. All steps align with geometric properties of rectangles and triangles.

**Step 6: Revisit Previous Steps**
- Confirm that all geometric properties and given constraints are consistently applied.
- Ensure no step contradicts the properties of a rectangle or the given angle measures.

**Step 7: Iteration and Reflection**
- The calculations and logical deductions have been consistent and verified through multiple checks.
- The solution aligns with the properties of a rectangle and the given geometric constraints.
