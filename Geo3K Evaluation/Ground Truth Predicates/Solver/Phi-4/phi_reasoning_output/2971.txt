**Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints**

We have four line segments with specified lengths:
- Length of Line(X, Y) = 3a + 7
- Length of Line(X, W) = b + 11
- Length of Line(W, Z) = 4a
- Length of Line(Y, Z) = 2b

**Step 2: Understand the Parallelogram Property**

In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in length. This property will be crucial for solving the problem. We need to identify which segments could form a parallelogram.

**Step 3: Identify Possible Parallelogram Sides**

Let's consider the segments:
- If Line(X, Y) and Line(W, Z) are opposite sides of a parallelogram, then:
  \[
  3a + 7 = 4a
  \]
  Solving for \(a\):
  \[
  3a + 7 = 4a \implies 7 = a
  \]

- If Line(X, W) and Line(Y, Z) are opposite sides of a parallelogram, then:
  \[
  b + 11 = 2b
  \]
  Solving for \(b\):
  \[
  b + 11 = 2b \implies 11 = b
  \]

**Step 4: Verify Consistency**

Let's verify if these values are consistent with the other segments:
- With \(a = 7\), check Line(X, Y) and Line(W, Z):
  \[
  \text{Length of Line(X, Y)} = 3(7) + 7 = 21 + 7 = 28
  \]
  \[
  \text{Length of Line(W, Z)} = 4(7) = 28
  \]
  These are equal, confirming the parallelogram property.

- With \(b = 11\), check Line(X, W) and Line(Y, Z):
  \[
  \text{Length of Line(X, W)} = 11 + 11 = 22
  \]
  \[
  \text{Length of Line(Y, Z)} = 2(11) = 22
  \]
  These are equal, confirming the parallelogram property.

**Step 5: Conclusion**

Both conditions for forming a parallelogram are satisfied with \(a = 7\) and \(b = 11\). The calculated value of \(b\) matches one of the answer choices.

</think>

**Solution:**

Given the analysis and verification, the value of \(b\) that satisfies the parallelogram condition is \(11\).
