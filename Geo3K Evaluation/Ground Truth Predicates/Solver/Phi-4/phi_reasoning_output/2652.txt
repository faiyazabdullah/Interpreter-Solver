1. **Analyzing the Geometric Constraints:**
   - We are given a right triangle with vertices A, B, and C.
   - \( C \) is the right angle because Line(C, A) is perpendicular to Line(C, B).
   - The sides are \( CB = a = 14 \), \( AC = b = 48 \), and \( AB = c = 50 \).

2. **Summarizing Relevant Findings:**
   - Since \( C \) is the right angle, by the Pythagorean theorem, \( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \).
   - We need to find \(\sin A\), which is \(\frac{\text{opposite side to } A}{\text{hypotenuse}}\).

3. **Verification of the Triangle:**
   - Verify if \( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \):
     \[
     c^2 = 50^2 = 2500
     \]
     \[
     a^2 + b^2 = 14^2 + 48^2 = 196 + 2304 = 2500
     \]
   - The equation holds true, confirming that the triangle is a right triangle.

4. **Finding \(\sin A\):**
   - In \(\triangle ABC\), \(\sin A = \frac{\text{opposite side to } A}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{BC}{AB} = \frac{a}{c}\).
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     \sin A = \frac{14}{50} = 0.28
     \]

5. **Comparison with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated \(\sin A = 0.28\).
   - Compare with the given choices: A. 0.14, B. 0.28, C. 0.48, D. 0.5.
   - The closest and exact match is B. 0.28.

6. **Reassessment and Reflection:**
   - Re-evaluate the steps to ensure no calculation errors.
   - Confirm that \(\sin A\) was correctly identified as \(\frac{a}{c}\) and calculated accurately.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The solution is consistent with the given constraints and calculations.
   - The correct answer choice is B. 0.28.

**Solution:**

1. Verify the right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \implies 50^2 = 14^2 + 48^2 \implies 2500 = 196 + 2304 = 2500
   \]
   The triangle is confirmed as a right triangle.

2. Calculate \(\sin A\):
   \[
   \sin A = \frac{\text{opposite side to } A}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{BC}{AB} = \frac{14}{50} = 0.28
   \]

3. Compare with answer choices:
   - The calculated value of \(\sin A\) is 0.28, which matches choice B.
