**Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints**

We are given the lengths of segments related to points \(P, Q, R, G, T, Z, H, F\). The crucial geometric condition is that lines \(l, m,\) and \(n\) are perpendicular bisectors of \(\triangle PQR\) and meet at \(T\). This means \(T\) is the circumcenter of \(\triangle PQR\).

**Step 2: Understand the Role of the Circumcenter**

Since \(T\) is the circumcenter, it is equidistant from all vertices of \(\triangle PQR\). Thus, \(TQ = TR = TP\).

**Step 3: Set Up Equations Based on the Circumcenter Property**

We have:
- \(TQ = 2x\)
- \(TR = 8\)
- \(TP = 3y - 1\)

Since \(T\) is equidistant from \(P, Q, R\), we equate these distances:
\[ TQ = TR = TP \]

This gives us:
1. \(2x = 8\)
2. \(3y - 1 = 8\)

**Step 4: Solve the Equations**

From equation 1:
\[ 2x = 8 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

From equation 2:
\[ 3y - 1 = 8 \]
\[ 3y = 9 \]
\[ y = 3 \]

**Step 5: Determine \(z\) Using the Length of Line \(PG\)**

We are given:
- \(PG = z + 4\)
- \(GR = 7\)

Since \(G\) lies on line \(PR\), and \(P, Q, R\) form a triangle with \(T\) as the circumcenter, \(G\) must be on the perpendicular bisector of \(PR\). However, we don't need this property to find \(z\).

**Step 6: Use the Segment Addition Postulate**

Since \(G\) lies on \(PR\), we can use the segment addition postulate:
\[ PG + GR = PR \]

We need to find \(PR\). Since \(T\) is the circumcenter and \(TP = TR = 8\), \(PR\) is the base of an isosceles triangle with \(T\) as the vertex.

Using the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle PQR\) with \(TQ = TR = 8\) and \(QR\) as the base:
- \(QR = \sqrt{(2x)^2 + (8)^2} = \sqrt{64 + 64} = \sqrt{128} = 8\sqrt{2}\)

Now, use the fact that \(PG + GR = PR\):
- \(PG + 7 = PR\)

Since \(PR\) is the base of the isosceles triangle \(\triangle PQR\) with \(TP = TR = 8\), we can find \(PR\) using the Pythagorean theorem:
- \(PR = \sqrt{(8)^2 - (4\sqrt{2})^2} = \sqrt{64 - 32} = \sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}\)

Thus:
\[ z + 4 + 7 = 4\sqrt{2} \]

However, this approach seems incorrect due to misinterpretation. Let's directly use the given:
- \(PG + GR = PR\)
- \(z + 4 + 7 = PR\)

Since \(TP = 8\), and \(TP\) is the radius of the circumcircle, \(PR\) must be twice the altitude from \(T\) to \(PR\) in \(\triangle PQR\).

Recalculate \(PR\) using the fact that \(T\) is equidistant:
- \(PR = 2 \times 8 \times \sin(45^\circ) = 16 \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 8\sqrt{2}\)

Thus:
\[ z + 4 + 7 = 8\sqrt{2} \]

This equation doesn't simplify directly, so let's use the given constraints:
- \(PG = z + 4\)
- \(GR = 7\)

Since \(G\) is on the perpendicular bisector, \(PG = GR\):
\[ z + 4 = 7 \]
\[ z = 3 \]

**Step 7: Verify and Conclude**

The calculations show \(z = 3\). This matches one of the answer choices.

</think>

**Solution:**

Given the constraints and the properties of the circumcenter, we found \(z\) by equating the segments \(PG\) and \(GR\) due to \(G\) lying on the perpendicular bisector of \(PR\). The calculations led us to \(z = 3\).
