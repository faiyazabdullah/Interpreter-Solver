**Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints**

- **LengthOf(Line(D, E)) = 12:** This is a diagonal of the rhombus.
- **LengthOf(Line(A, E)) = 7:** This is half of another diagonal, since \(E\) lies on both diagonals.
- **LengthOf(Line(A, E)) = LengthOf(Line(B, E)):** This confirms that \(E\) is the midpoint of diagonal \(AB\).
- **LengthOf(Line(C, E)) = LengthOf(Line(D, E)):** This indicates that \(E\) is the midpoint of diagonal \(CD\).
- **PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(C, D)) and PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(A, B)):** This confirms \(E\) is the intersection point of the diagonals.

**Step 2: Understand the Structure of the Rhombus**

- In a rhombus, diagonals bisect each other at right angles.
- Given \(E\) is the midpoint of both diagonals, the diagonals are perpendicular.

**Step 3: Determine the Lengths of the Diagonals**

- Diagonal \(CD = DE + EC = 12 + 12 = 24\).
- Since \(AE = 7\) and \(E\) is the midpoint of \(AB\), diagonal \(AB = 2 \times AE = 2 \times 7 = 14\).

**Step 4: Calculate the Area of the Rhombus**

- The area \(A\) of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula:
  \[
  A = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2
  \]
  where \(d_1\) and \(d_2\) are the lengths of the diagonals.

- Substituting the known values:
  \[
  A = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 \times 14 = \frac{1}{2} \times 336 = 168
  \]

**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated area is 168, which matches option C.

**Step 6: Select the Closest Answer**

- Since the calculated area exactly matches one of the answer choices, select C.

**Solution**

The area of the rhombus is calculated using the formula for the area of a rhombus with given diagonals. The diagonals are \(24\) and \(14\), leading to an area calculation of:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 \times 14 = \frac{1}{2} \times 336 = 168
\]

Thus, the correct answer is option C.
