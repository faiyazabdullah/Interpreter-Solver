1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have several geometric constraints:
     - \( CD = 15 \)
     - \( BE = 5 \)
     - \( BC = 13 \)
     - Point \( E \) lies on line \( AB \)
     - Line \( CE \) is perpendicular to line \( EB \)

2. **Identify the Goal:**
   - We need to find the area of the parallelogram formed by these points. Given the constraints, it seems like \( CDEB \) forms a parallelogram.

3. **Understand the Geometry:**
   - Since \( CE \) is perpendicular to \( EB \), \( \triangle CEB \) is a right triangle.
   - Use the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle CEB \):
     \[
     CE^2 + BE^2 = BC^2
     \]
     \[
     CE^2 + 5^2 = 13^2
     \]
     \[
     CE^2 + 25 = 169
     \]
     \[
     CE^2 = 144
     \]
     \[
     CE = 12
     \]

4. **Calculate the Area of the Parallelogram:**
   - The area of parallelogram \( CDEB \) can be calculated using the base \( BE \) and height \( CE \) (since \( CE \) is perpendicular to \( BE \)):
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Base} \times \text{Height} = BE \times CE = 5 \times 12 = 60
     \]

5. **Consider the Full Parallelogram:**
   - Since \( CD = 15 \) and \( CDEB \) is a parallelogram, \( DE \) must also be 15 (opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal).
   - The parallelogram \( CDEB \) is twice the area of \( \triangle CEB \) because \( CDEB \) is composed of two congruent right triangles \( \triangle CEB \) and \( \triangle DEB \).

6. **Recalculate the Full Area:**
   - The area of \( \triangle CEB \) is:
     \[
     \text{Area of } \triangle CEB = \frac{1}{2} \times BE \times CE = \frac{1}{2} \times 5 \times 12 = 30
     \]
   - Since \( CDEB \) is composed of two such triangles:
     \[
     \text{Area of parallelogram } CDEB = 2 \times 30 = 60
     \]

7. **Reassess the Problem:**
   - The given constraints and calculations suggest that the parallelogram \( CDEB \) is not the full parallelogram we are looking for. We need to consider the entire parallelogram formed by extending these lines.
   - The full parallelogram involves extending \( CD \) and \( BE \) to form a larger parallelogram \( ABCD \).

8. **Calculate the Full Parallelogram Area:**
   - The full parallelogram \( ABCD \) has a base \( CD = 15 \) and height \( BE = 12 \) (since \( CE = 12 \) is the height from \( C \) to line \( AB \)).
   - The area of parallelogram \( ABCD \) is:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Base} \times \text{Height} = 15 \times 12 = 180
     \]

9. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated area of the parallelogram \( ABCD \) is 180, which matches option B.

</think>

<Solution>
The area of the parallelogram \( ABCD \) is calculated using the base \( CD = 15 \) and height \( BE = 12 \). The area is:
\[
\text{Area} = 15 \times 12 = 180
\]
Thus, the correct answer is B.

Final Answer: B
</Solution>
