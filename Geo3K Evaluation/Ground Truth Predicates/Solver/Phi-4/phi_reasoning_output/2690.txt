**Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints**

- We have several line segments with given lengths expressed in terms of \(x\) and \(y\):
  1. \( \text{Length of } \overline{CE} = 4y - 7 \)
  2. \( \text{Length of } \overline{BD} = 5x - 8 \)
  3. \( \text{Length of } \overline{AD} = 3x + 11 \)
  4. \( \text{Length of } \overline{BE} = 2y - 1 \)

- Points \(D\) and \(E\) lie on lines \(\overline{AB}\) and \(\overline{BC}\), respectively.
- Lines \(\overline{AC}\) and \(\overline{DE}\) are parallel.
- The lengths of \(\overline{BD}\) and \(\overline{AD}\) are equal.

**Step 2: Identify Key Equations and Relationships**

- From the equality of lengths: 
  \[
  5x - 8 = 3x + 11
  \]

- Solve this equation for \(x\):
  \[
  5x - 3x = 11 + 8
  \]
  \[
  2x = 19
  \]
  \[
  x = \frac{19}{2} = 9.5
  \]

**Step 3: Verify with Parallel Line Condition**

- Since \(\overline{AC} \parallel \overline{DE}\), this implies that triangles \(\triangle ADE\) and \(\triangle CDE\) are similar by the Basic Proportionality Theorem (or Thales' theorem).

- However, we already have enough information from the equality of segments \(\overline{BD}\) and \(\overline{AD}\) to solve for \(x\).

**Step 4: Compare Calculated \(x\) with Answer Choices**

- The calculated value of \(x\) is 9.5, which matches one of the answer choices.

**Step 5: Conclusion**

- The calculations are consistent with the given conditions and constraints.
- The closest answer choice to the calculated \(x\) is 9.5.

</think>

**Solution:**

Given the equation \(5x - 8 = 3x + 11\), solving for \(x\) yields:

\[
5x - 3x = 11 + 8 \implies 2x = 19 \implies x = \frac{19}{2} = 9.5
\]

This value of \(x\) matches the answer choice A. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A
