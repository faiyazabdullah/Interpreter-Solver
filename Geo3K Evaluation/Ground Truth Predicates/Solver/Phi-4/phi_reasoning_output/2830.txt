1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have several line segments with lengths expressed in terms of \(x\) or constants.
   - The constraints include lengths and parallelism between various lines.
   - Specifically, the lengths are given as:
     - \( \text{Length of Line } (J, C) = 8 \)
     - \( \text{Length of Line } (O, B) = 7x - 2 \)
     - \( \text{Length of Line } (E, J) = 8 \)
     - \( \text{Length of Line } (B, H) = 4x + 3 \)
   - Lines \( (O, C) \), \( (B, J) \), and \( (E, H) \) are parallel.

2. **Identify Relationships and Constraints:**
   - Parallel lines imply certain geometric properties, like equal alternate interior angles or proportional segments if transversals are involved.
   - However, no transversals intersect these parallel lines are directly mentioned, so we focus on the lengths.

3. **Identify What Needs to Be Found:**
   - We need to find the value of \(x\).

4. **Apply Geometric Properties:**
   - Since \( (O, C) \parallel (B, J) \parallel (E, H) \), if there were a transversal, corresponding or alternate interior angles would be equal, but we lack explicit transversal information.
   - Focus on equal lengths or proportional relationships due to parallelism:
     - We can use the fact that the lengths of parallel line segments can be compared if they are between the same set of transversals. However, no explicit transversal is given, so we focus on the equality of lengths.
     - We have two segments \( (J, C) \) and \( (E, J) \), both equal to 8, but they don't directly help in finding \(x\).

5. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Use the parallel lines and given lengths to set up an equation:
     - Since \( (O, C) \parallel (B, J) \) and no additional transversal information is given, we consider the possibility of equal segments or proportional relationships.
     - Consider the segments \( (O, B) \) and \( (B, H) \):
       - \( \text{Length of Line } (O, B) = 7x - 2 \)
       - \( \text{Length of Line } (B, H) = 4x + 3 \)
     - If \( (O, B) \) and \( (B, H) \) are part of a larger segment \( (O, H) \) that could be split proportionally, we can set them equal under the assumption of equal partitioning due to parallelism:
       \[
       7x - 2 = 4x + 3
       \]

6. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Solve for \(x\):
     \[
     7x - 2 = 4x + 3
     \]
     \[
     7x - 4x = 3 + 2
     \]
     \[
     3x = 5
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{5}{3}
     \]

7. **Verify and Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated value of \(x = \frac{5}{3}\) matches one of the provided answer choices.
   - Ensure no other relationships or constraints were overlooked that could alter this conclusion.

8. **Select the Closest Answer:**
   - Since \(x = \frac{5}{3}\) is directly one of the answer choices, select it.

</think>

**Solution:**
The value of \(x\) that satisfies the given geometric constraints is \(\frac{5}{3}\). This matches option A.
