1. **Analyze the given geometric constraints:**
   - We are given that \(\triangle JLM \sim \triangle QST\). This similarity means that corresponding angles are equal, and corresponding sides are in proportion.
   - The given angle equalities are:
     - \(\angle LJM = \angle TQS\)
     - \(\angle JML = \angle STQ\)
   - The side lengths are given as:
     - \(MJ = 4\), \(ST = 3\), \(TQ = 2\), \(SQ = 5\)
     - \(ML = 6x - 3\), \(JL = 3y - 2\)

2. **Identify what needs to be found:**
   - We need to find the value of \(x\) such that the similarity condition holds true between \(\triangle JLM\) and \(\triangle QST\).

3. **Apply relevant geometric theorems and properties:**
   - Since \(\triangle JLM \sim \triangle QST\), the ratios of corresponding sides must be equal:
     \[
     \frac{MJ}{ST} = \frac{ML}{SQ} = \frac{JL}{TQ}
     \]

4. **Set up the proportion using known side lengths:**
   - From \(\frac{MJ}{ST} = \frac{ML}{SQ}\):
     \[
     \frac{4}{3} = \frac{6x - 3}{5}
     \]

5. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - Cross-multiply to solve the equation:
     \[
     4 \times 5 = 3 \times (6x - 3)
     \]
     \[
     20 = 18x - 9
     \]
     \[
     29 = 18x
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{29}{18}
     \]

6. **Verify the calculation:**
   - Calculate \(\frac{29}{18}\) to check which answer choice it is closest to:
     \[
     \frac{29}{18} \approx 1.611
     \]

7. **Compare with the given answer choices:**
   - The calculated value \(x \approx 1.611\) is closest to 1.5.

8. **Reassess and verify:**
   - Check the other proportion \(\frac{MJ}{ST} = \frac{JL}{TQ}\) to ensure consistency:
     \[
     \frac{4}{3} = \frac{3y - 2}{2}
     \]
     - Solving for \(y\) is not necessary for finding \(x\), but it can be checked for consistency if needed.

9. **Select the closest answer choice:**
   - The closest value to \(1.611\) among the choices is 1.5.

</think>

<Solution>
Based on the calculations and the analysis of the given geometric constraints, the value of \(x\) that satisfies the similarity condition is closest to 1.5. Therefore, the correct answer is:
