**Step 1: Understand the Problem and Given Information**

We are given a set of geometric constraints involving points and lines. The key point here is that \( P \) is the incenter of \(\triangle AEC\). This means \( P \) is the intersection point of the angle bisectors of \(\triangle AEC\). We need to find the measure of \(\angle DEP\).

**Step 2: Analyze the Constraints**

- \( P \) is the incenter of \(\triangle AEC\), so it lies on the angle bisectors of \(\angle EAC\), \(\angle AEC\), and \(\angle ECA\).
- \( \angle FAP = 33^\circ \)
- \( \angle PCD = 28.5^\circ \)
- \( P \) lies on lines \( FC \), \( EB \), and \( AD \).
- \( D \) lies on line \( EC \).
- \( F \) lies on line \( EA \).
- \( B \) lies on line \( AC \).
- There are several perpendicular relationships given.

**Step 3: Identify Relevant Geometric Properties**

- Since \( P \) is the incenter, it is equidistant from the sides \( AE \), \( EC \), and \( CA \).
- The angle bisector theorem and properties of perpendiculars may be useful.

**Step 4: Determine \(\angle DEP\)**

- \( D \) lies on line \( EC \), and \( P \) is on line \( AD \).
- We need to find \(\angle DEP\), which involves understanding the position of \( D \), \( E \), and \( P \).

**Step 5: Use Given Angles and Perpendiculars**

- Since \( \angle PCD = 28.5^\circ \) and \( P \) is the incenter, \( \angle EPC = \angle ECA / 2 \).
- \( P \) lies on the angle bisector of \(\angle AEC\), so \(\angle AEP = \angle CEP\).

**Step 6: Consider Perpendiculars and Constraints**

- \( \angle FPA = 90^\circ \) (since \( FP \perp EF \)).
- \( \angle PDB = 90^\circ \) (since \( PD \perp ED \)).

**Step 7: Calculate \(\angle DEP\)**

- Since \( P \) is the incenter, \(\angle AEP = \angle CEP\).
- Given \( \angle PCD = 28.5^\circ \), and knowing \( PD \perp ED \), we can infer that \(\angle DEP\) is influenced by these perpendiculars and angle bisectors.

**Step 8: Compare with Answer Choices**

- Given the constraints and the fact that \( \angle PCD = 28.5^\circ \), and considering the perpendiculars, \(\angle DEP\) is likely influenced by this angle.
- The closest logical choice, considering the constraints and the influence of the given angles, is \( 28.5^\circ \).

**Step 9: Select the Closest Answer**

- The calculated influence and given constraints suggest \(\angle DEP\) is closest to \( 28.5^\circ \).

</think>

**Solution:**

Given the constraints and the properties of the incenter, the measure of \(\angle DEP\) is influenced by the angle \(\angle PCD = 28.5^\circ\) and the perpendicular relationships. The closest match to the calculated influence is \( 28.5^\circ \).
