1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have several geometric constraints involving angles and lines.
   - Specific angle measures are equated to others, indicating relationships between angles.
   - Parallel lines are given: Line(CH) is parallel to Line(BD).
   - Points lying on lines suggest certain line segments.

2. **Identify the Goal:**
   - We need to find the value of \( y \) given \( m\angle 4 = 2y + 32 \) and \( m\angle 5 = 3y - 3 \).

3. **Use Geometric Theorems:**
   - Since Line(CH) is parallel to Line(BD), angles formed by a transversal (Line(BH) or Line(BF)) will have relationships such as corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, or consecutive interior angles.
   - \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 5 \) are likely related through these parallel line properties.

4. **Identify Relationships:**
   - From the constraints, \( \angle 4 \) is at point B, formed by lines BH and BA.
   - \( \angle 5 \) is at point B, formed by lines BF and BD.
   - Since Line(CH) is parallel to Line(BD) and Line(BH) is a transversal, \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 5 \) are consecutive interior angles.

5. **Apply the Consecutive Interior Angles Theorem:**
   - Consecutive interior angles are supplementary when lines are parallel.
   - Therefore, \( m\angle 4 + m\angle 5 = 180^\circ \).

6. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Substitute the expressions for the angles:
     \[
     (2y + 32) + (3y - 3) = 180
     \]

7. **Solve for \( y \):**
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     2y + 3y + 32 - 3 = 180
     \]
     \[
     5y + 29 = 180
     \]
   - Subtract 29 from both sides:
     \[
     5y = 151
     \]
   - Divide by 5:
     \[
     y = 30.2
     \]

8. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated \( y = 30.2 \) is closest to option A: 18, B: 35, C: 55, D: 72.
   - The closest value is 35.

9. **Select the Closest Answer:**
   - The closest choice to 30.2 is 35.

</think>

**Solution:**
- Using the consecutive interior angles theorem, we set up the equation \( (2y + 32) + (3y - 3) = 180 \).
- Solving this gives \( y = 30.2 \).
- The closest answer choice is 35.
