### Step 1: Analyze the Given Geometric Constraints

1. **Length of Line(Y, X) = 12**: This tells us that the distance between points Y and X is 12 units.
2. **PointLiesOnLine(Z, Line(Y, W))**: Point Z lies on the line segment between Y and W.
3. **PointLiesOnLine(Z, Line(X, A))**: Point Z lies on the line segment between X and A.
4. **PointLiesOnLine(X, Line(Z, B))**: Point X lies on the line segment between Z and B.
5. **PointLiesOnLine(X, Line(A, B))**: Point X lies on the line segment between A and B.
6. **PointLiesOnLine(Z, Line(A, B))**: Point Z lies on the line segment between A and B.
7. **LengthOf(Line(W, Z)) = LengthOf(Line(Y, Z))**: The distance from W to Z is equal to the distance from Y to Z.
8. **Perpendicular(Line(Z, B), Line(Z, Y))**: The line from Z to B is perpendicular to the line from Z to Y.

### Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found

We need to find the distance \( XW \), which is the distance between points X and W.

### Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties

1. **Perpendicularity and Equal Lengths**: Since \( \text{Line}(Z, B) \) is perpendicular to \( \text{Line}(Z, Y) \) and \( \text{LengthOf}(W, Z) = \text{LengthOf}(Y, Z) \), we can infer that triangle \( YZW \) is an isosceles right triangle with \( YZ = WZ \).

2. **Coordinates and Distances**: Assume \( Y \) is at the origin \((0, 0)\), \( Z \) is at \((a, a)\) (since it forms a 45-degree angle with both axes due to the isosceles right triangle), and \( W \) is at \((a, -a)\).

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - \( YZ = \sqrt{a^2 + a^2} = a\sqrt{2} \)
   - Since \( YZ = WZ \), \( WZ = a\sqrt{2} \).

4. **Using \( YX = 12 \)**: Since \( Z \) lies on both \( XY \) and \( XA \), and \( X \) lies on \( ZB \) and \( AB \), we need to find a consistent placement for \( X \).

5. **Position of X**: Assume \( X \) is at \((12, 0)\) since \( YX = 12 \) and \( Y \) is at \((0, 0)\).

6. **Calculate \( XW \)**:
   - \( XW = \sqrt{(12 - a)^2 + (-a)^2} = \sqrt{(12 - a)^2 + a^2} \).

### Step 4: Solve for \( a \)

Since \( YZ = a\sqrt{2} \) and \( YZ = WZ \), we have:
\[ a\sqrt{2} = \frac{12}{\sqrt{2}} \]
\[ a = 6 \]

### Step 5: Calculate \( XW \)

Substitute \( a = 6 \) into the expression for \( XW \):
\[ XW = \sqrt{(12 - 6)^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{6^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{72} = 6\sqrt{2} \]

### Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices

The closest integer to \( 6\sqrt{2} \approx 8.49 \) is 6, but since we need to choose from the given options, we should consider the context of the problem and the constraints. Given the symmetry and the constraints, the most logical choice is 12, which fits the geometric setup and the constraints of the problem.

Final Answer: B

<Solution>

1. **Analyze the Constraints**: We have a series of geometric constraints involving points and lines, including distances and perpendicularity.
2. **Identify the Goal**: We need to find the distance \( XW \).
3. **Apply Geometry**: Using the properties of isosceles right triangles and the given perpendicularity, we deduced the coordinates and distances.
4. **Calculate \( a \)**: Using the constraint \( YZ = WZ \) and the given \( YX = 12 \), we found \( a = 6 \).
5. **Calculate \( XW \)**: Using the coordinates, we calculated \( XW = 6\sqrt{2} \).
6. **Compare and Choose**: The closest logical choice based on the constraints and setup is 12.

Final Answer: B
