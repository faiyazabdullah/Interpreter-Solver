### Thought Section

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a set of geometric constraints involving points \( A, B, C, D, E, F \).
   - Several line segments are defined with specific lengths, and point \( F \) lies on multiple lines and circles.
   - The task is to find \( x \), where \( x \) is the length of line segment \( BF \).

2. **Analyzing the Constraints:**
   - \( \text{Length of } FD = 5 \)
   - \( \text{Length of } FE = 4 \)
   - \( \text{Length of } FC = x + 8 \)
   - \( \text{Length of } BF = x \)
   - Point \( F \) lies on lines \( BC \) and \( ED \).
   - Points \( B, C, D, E \) lie on circle \( \text{Circle}(A, \text{radius}_0_0) \).

3. **Exploring Geometric Relationships:**
   - Since \( B, C, D, E \) lie on the same circle centered at \( A \), they are equidistant from \( A \).
   - Point \( F \) lies on lines \( BC \) and \( ED \), suggesting it might be the intersection of these lines.
   - Given \( FD = 5 \) and \( FE = 4 \), \( F \) could be the point where the tangents from \( F \) to the circle are equal, suggesting \( F \) is the radical center.

4. **Applying the Power of a Point Theorem:**
   - For point \( F \) with respect to circle \( \text{Circle}(A, \text{radius}_0_0) \), the power of point \( F \) is given by:
     \[
     \text{Power of } F = BF^2 - r^2 = CF \cdot FB = DF \cdot FE
     \]
   - Substituting the known lengths:
     \[
     x^2 = (x + 8) \cdot x = 5 \cdot 4 = 20
     \]

5. **Solving the Equation:**
   - From \( x^2 = 20 \), solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x^2 = 20 \implies x = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5} \approx 4.47
     \]

6. **Comparing with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated \( x \approx 4.47 \) is closest to choice \( B \) which is \( 4 \).

7. **Verification:**
   - Reassess the setup and calculations to ensure no steps are missed or miscalculated.
   - Confirm that the geometric interpretation and application of the power of a point theorem are correct.

### Solution Section

Based on the analysis and calculations:

- The power of point \( F \) with respect to the circle gives us \( x^2 = 20 \).
- Solving \( x^2 = 20 \) yields \( x = \sqrt{20} \approx 4.47 \).
- The closest answer choice to \( 4.47 \) is \( 4 \).
