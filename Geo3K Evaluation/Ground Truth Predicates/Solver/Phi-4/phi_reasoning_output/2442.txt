**Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Constraints**

The problem provides several geometric constraints involving angles and points. Specifically:
- Four angles are given as equal to \( x \):
  - \(\angle DEA = x\)
  - \(\angle AEC = x\)
  - \(\angle BED = x\)
  - \(\angle CEB = x\)
- Point \( E \) lies on lines \( AB \) and \( CD \).

**Step 2: Summarize the Given Information**

The points \( A, B, C, D \), and \( E \) are arranged such that \( E \) is a common intersection of lines \( AB \) and \( CD \). The angles at point \( E \) are all equal to \( x \).

**Step 3: Explore Geometric Properties**

Since \( E \) is on both lines \( AB \) and \( CD \), it acts as a vertex for four angles around it. The sum of angles around a point is \( 360^\circ \).

**Step 4: Set Up the Equation**

Given that the four angles around point \( E \) are equal, we can write:
\[
\angle DEA + \angle AEC + \angle BED + \angle CEB = 360^\circ
\]
Substituting \( x \) for each angle, we have:
\[
x + x + x + x = 360^\circ
\]
\[
4x = 360^\circ
\]

**Step 5: Solve for \( x \)**

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{360^\circ}{4} = 90^\circ
\]

**Step 6: Verify and Compare with Answer Choices**

The calculated value of \( x \) is \( 90^\circ \), which matches one of the provided answer choices.

**Step 7: Finalize the Solution**

Since \( x = 90^\circ \) is an exact match with one of the answer choices, we select it as the correct answer.

**Solution:**

Based on the analysis and calculations, the value of \( x \) is \( 90^\circ \). This matches answer choice C. Therefore, the correct answer is:
