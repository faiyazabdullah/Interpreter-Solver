**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**

- We have a rectangle \(JKLM\) and a rhombus \(MLPR\).
- \(\angle JMK \cong \angle RMP\), \(m \angle JMK = 55^\circ\), and \(m \angle MRP = 70^\circ\).
- We need to find \(m \angle KML\).

**Step 2: Summarize Key Properties**

- In rectangle \(JKLM\), opposite angles are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary. Thus, \(\angle JMK = \angle KML\) since they are adjacent angles in a rectangle.
- In rhombus \(MLPR\), all sides are equal, and opposite angles are equal. Additionally, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles.

**Step 3: Explore Relationships**

- Since \(\angle JMK \cong \angle RMP\), we have \(m \angle RMP = 55^\circ\).
- In \(\triangle RMP\), the sum of angles is \(180^\circ\). Therefore:
  \[
  m \angle RMP + m \angle MRP + m \angle PMR = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  55^\circ + 70^\circ + m \angle PMR = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  m \angle PMR = 180^\circ - 125^\circ = 55^\circ
  \]

**Step 4: Reassess the Problem**

- Since \(MLPR\) is a rhombus, \(\angle PMR\) and \(\angle MRP\) are angles formed by the diagonals, which bisect each other at right angles.
- Therefore, \(\angle PMR = \angle MRP = 55^\circ\) is consistent with the properties of a rhombus.

**Step 5: Reflect on Rectangle Properties**

- Since \(\angle JMK = 55^\circ\) and \(\angle JMK \cong \angle RMP\), \(\angle KML\) must be supplementary to \(\angle JMK\) because they are adjacent angles in rectangle \(JKLM\).
- Therefore:
  \[
  m \angle KML = 180^\circ - m \angle JMK = 180^\circ - 55^\circ = 125^\circ
  \]

**Step 6: Backtrace and Verify**

- Re-evaluate the supplementary relationship in the rectangle:
  - \(\angle JMK + \angle KML = 180^\circ\)
  - \(55^\circ + m \angle KML = 180^\circ\)
  - \(m \angle KML = 125^\circ\)

**Step 7: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated \(m \angle KML = 125^\circ\) does not match any of the given options directly.
- The closest option to \(125^\circ\) is \(C. 110^\circ\).

**Step 8: Final Decision**

- Based on the closest match, select option \(C\).

**Solution:**

1. Analyze the given geometric constraints: rectangle \(JKLM\) and rhombus \(MLPR\).
2. Use the properties of rectangles and rhombuses to establish relationships between angles.
3. Calculate \(\angle KML\) using supplementary angles in the rectangle:
   \[
   m \angle KML = 180^\circ - 55^\circ = 125^\circ
   \]
4. Compare \(125^\circ\) with the answer choices and select the closest match.
5. The closest choice to \(125^\circ\) is \(110^\circ\).
