**Step 1: Analyze the given geometric constraints and problem statement.**

- We have points \(D\) and \(E\) lying on lines through \(A\), specifically:
  - \(D\) lies on line \(BA\).
  - \(E\) lies on line \(CA\).
- There is another line through \(D\) and \(E\), which is parallel to line \(BC\).
- Given distances:
  - \(DB = 24\)
  - \(AE = 3\)
  - \(EC = 18\)
- We need to find \(AD\).

**Step 2: Summarize relevant findings.**

- Since \(DE\) is parallel to \(BC\), triangles \(ADE\) and \(ABC\) are similar by the Basic Proportionality Theorem (also known as Thales' theorem).
- The similarity gives us the proportionality of corresponding sides:
  \[
  \frac{AD}{AB} = \frac{AE}{AC} = \frac{DE}{BC}
  \]

**Step 3: Calculate lengths using similarity.**

- Calculate \(AC\):
  \[
  AC = AE + EC = 3 + 18 = 21
  \]
- Use the similarity ratio:
  \[
  \frac{AE}{AC} = \frac{3}{21} = \frac{1}{7}
  \]
  Thus, \(\frac{AD}{AB} = \frac{1}{7}\).

**Step 4: Express \(AB\) in terms of known quantities.**

- Since \(D\) lies on \(BA\), we have:
  \[
  AB = AD + DB
  \]
- Substitute the ratio:
  \[
  \frac{AD}{AD + 24} = \frac{1}{7}
  \]

**Step 5: Solve for \(AD\).**

- Cross-multiply to solve the equation:
  \[
  7 \cdot AD = AD + 24
  \]
  \[
  7AD - AD = 24
  \]
  \[
  6AD = 24
  \]
  \[
  AD = \frac{24}{6} = 4
  \]

**Step 6: Verify and select the closest answer choice.**

- The calculated \(AD\) is 4, which matches choice B.

<Solution>
Based on the steps above, we have determined that the length \(AD\) is 4. This matches with the provided answer choice B. Thus, the final answer is:

Final Answer: B
