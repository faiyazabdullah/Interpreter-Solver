1. **Analyzing the Given Geometric Constraints:**
   - We have a line segment \( \overline{AH} \) with a length of 7 units.
   - There is a line segment \( \overline{BC} \) with a length of 10.2 units.
   - Point \( H \) lies on line \( \overline{BC} \).
   - Line \( \overline{AH} \) is perpendicular to line \( \overline{BC} \).

2. **Summarizing the Geometric Figure:**
   - The constraints suggest that we are dealing with a right triangle \( \triangle ABH \) (or \( \triangle BCH \)), where \( \overline{AH} \) is the height from \( A \) to the base \( \overline{BC} \).
   - \( \overline{BC} \) is the base of the triangle, and \( \overline{AH} \) is the height since it is perpendicular to \( \overline{BC} \).

3. **Identifying the Required Quantity:**
   - We need to find the area of the triangle formed by these constraints.

4. **Applying Geometric Formulas:**
   - The area \( A \) of a triangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]
   - Here, the base \( \overline{BC} \) is 10.2 units, and the height \( \overline{AH} \) is 7 units.

5. **Calculating the Area:**
   - Substitute the known values into the area formula:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10.2 \times 7
     \]
   - Calculate the product:
     \[
     10.2 \times 7 = 71.4
     \]
   - Now, calculate the area:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 71.4 = 35.7
     \]

6. **Verifying and Comparing with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated area is 35.7.
   - Compare this with the given answer choices: A. 35.7, B. 49, C. 71.4, D. 104.0.
   - The closest and exact match is option A: 35.7.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The calculated area matches exactly with option A.
   - There are no errors in the calculation, and all steps have been verified.

**Solution:**
Based on the analysis and calculations, the area of the triangle is 35.7. This matches exactly with answer choice A.
