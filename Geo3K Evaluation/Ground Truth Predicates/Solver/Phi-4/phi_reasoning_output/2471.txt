**Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**
- We are given a trapezoid with specific geometric constraints.
- We have line segments AE, CB, and AD with lengths 23, 37, and 22 respectively.
- Point E lies on line CB.
- Line AE is perpendicular to line EC, suggesting that AE and EC form a right angle.

**Step 2: Visualize the Trapezoid**
- Points A and E define one line, and points C and B define another line.
- Since E lies on CB and AE is perpendicular to EC, triangle AEC is a right triangle.
- AD is another segment, suggesting it could be parallel to CB, forming the trapezoid ACBD.

**Step 3: Identify the Trapezoid**
- The trapezoid is likely ACBD, where AB is the parallel side to CD (or AD).
- AE is the height of the trapezoid from A to line CB.

**Step 4: Calculate the Height**
- Since AE is perpendicular to EC, AE is the height of the trapezoid.
- Height = Length of AE = 23.

**Step 5: Determine the Bases of the Trapezoid**
- One base is CB = 37.
- The other base is AD = 22.

**Step 6: Calculate the Area of the Trapezoid**
- The formula for the area of a trapezoid is:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{Base}_1 + \text{Base}_2) \times \text{Height}
  \]
- Substitute the known values:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (37 + 22) \times 23
  \]
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 59 \times 23
  \]
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1357
  \]
  \[
  \text{Area} = 678.5
  \]

**Step 7: Verify and Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated area is 678.5.
- Compare with the given answer choices: A. 506, B. 667, C. 678.5, D. 851.
- The closest and exact match is option C.

**Step 8: Finalize the Answer**
- Based on the calculations and comparison, the correct answer is C.

**Solution:**

1. Identify the trapezoid ACBD with bases CB and AD.
2. Calculate the height using AE = 23.
3. Use the trapezoid area formula:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (37 + 22) \times 23 = 678.5
   \]
4. Compare the calculated area with the answer choices.
5. The closest match is option C.

Final Answer: C
