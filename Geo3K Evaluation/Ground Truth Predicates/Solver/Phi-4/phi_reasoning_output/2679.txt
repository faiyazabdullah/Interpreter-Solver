1. **Analyze the Given Information**: 
   - We have a set of geometric constraints involving points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H and the lines they lie on.
   - Key angles and lines are defined, and parallel lines are mentioned: Line(G, C) is parallel to Line(F, E).
   - We need to find the measure of Angle(E, F, G), denoted as x.

2. **Summarize the Given Constraints**:
   - Angle(A, G, C) is given as 55 degrees.
   - Point F lies on lines through A-G, A-H, and D-E.
   - Point G lies on lines through A-H, F-H, B-C, and is also on line G-C.
   - Lines G-C and F-E are parallel.

3. **Consider the Implications of Parallel Lines**:
   - Since Line(G, C) is parallel to Line(F, E), Angle(A, G, C) and Angle(E, F, G) are alternate interior angles formed by the transversal line A-G or A-H.
   - Alternate interior angles between parallel lines are equal.

4. **Apply Geometric Theorems**:
   - Use the property of parallel lines and transversals: Alternate interior angles are equal.
   - Therefore, MeasureOf(Angle(E, F, G)) = MeasureOf(Angle(A, G, C)).

5. **Calculate the Value of x**:
   - Since MeasureOf(Angle(A, G, C)) is 55 degrees, then MeasureOf(Angle(E, F, G)) is also 55 degrees.

6. **Verify and Compare**:
   - Check the calculated value against the answer choices: A. 55, B. 115, C. 125, D. 135.
   - The calculated value of 55 matches exactly with option A.

7. **Reassess**:
   - All steps have been verified, and the geometric reasoning holds true given the constraints and properties of parallel lines.

**Solution**:
Based on the geometric properties and constraints provided, the measure of Angle(E, F, G), denoted as x, is equal to the measure of Angle(A, G, C) due to the parallel lines and transversal property. Therefore, the value of x is 55 degrees.
