**Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints**

- Several points are collinear:
  - J, G, B are collinear on line L.
  - K is collinear with J, G, B on line L.
  - G, J, B are collinear, indicating J is between G and B.
  - G, B are also collinear with J on a separate line from G to B.
  - I is on line CG.
  - G is on line FH.
  - G, H, F are collinear with G between F and H.

- Several points lie on circles:
  - F, L, B, H are on Circle G with center G and radius 1.0.
  - G, L, H are on Circle J with center J and radius 6.0.
  - D, J, L, I, C are on Circle K with center K and radius 3.0.

**Step 2: Identify the Problem**

We need to find the distance FH given GH = 10 and the points F, G, H are collinear with G between F and H.

**Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Properties**

- Since F, L, B, H lie on Circle G with radius 1.0, the distance FG, GH, and FH must satisfy the circle's properties.
- G is the center of Circle G, so GF = GH = 1.0.

**Step 4: Calculate FH**

- Given GH = 10, and G is between F and H on the line FH:
  - FH = FG + GH = 1.0 + 10 = 11.0.

**Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**

- The calculated FH is 11.0.
- The closest answer choice to 11.0 is 10.

**Step 6: Conclusion**

- The closest answer choice to the calculated FH is B. 10.

Final Answer: B
