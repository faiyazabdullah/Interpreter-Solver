**Step 1: Analyze the Given Constraints**

We have the following geometric constraints:
- Length of line segment \(WX = 6\)
- Length of line segment \(PX = 4\)
- Point \(P\) lies on line \(ZX\)
- Point \(P\) lies on line \(WY\)

**Step 2: Understand the Structure of a Kite**

A kite is a quadrilateral with two pairs of adjacent sides that are equal. In kite \(WXYZ\), we have:
- \(WX = WY\) (since \(W\) is a common vertex for both pairs)
- \(XZ = YZ\) (since \(Z\) is a common vertex for both pairs)

**Step 3: Identify What Needs to Be Found**

We need to find the length \(WP\).

**Step 4: Apply Geometric Properties**

Since \(P\) lies on both \(ZX\) and \(WY\), \(P\) is the intersection of these two lines. In a kite, the diagonals intersect at right angles. Therefore, \(WP\) and \(PX\) are perpendicular.

**Step 5: Use the Pythagorean Theorem**

Since \(WP\) and \(PX\) are perpendicular, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \(WPX\):
\[
WX^2 = WP^2 + PX^2
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
6^2 = WP^2 + 4^2
\]
\[
36 = WP^2 + 16
\]
\[
WP^2 = 36 - 16
\]
\[
WP^2 = 20
\]
\[
WP = \sqrt{20}
\]

**Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**

The calculated length \(WP = \sqrt{20}\) matches answer choice A.

**Step 7: Final Verification**

Reassess the steps:
- The properties of a kite and the perpendicularity of diagonals were correctly applied.
- The Pythagorean theorem was correctly used to find \(WP\).

**Conclusion**

The calculations are consistent with the geometric properties and constraints given. The closest answer choice is \(\sqrt{20}\).

</think>

**Solution:**

The length \(WP\) is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle \(WPX\) as follows:
\[
WX^2 = WP^2 + PX^2 \implies 6^2 = WP^2 + 4^2 \implies 36 = WP^2 + 16 \implies WP^2 = 20 \implies WP = \sqrt{20}
\]

The correct answer choice is \(\sqrt{20}\), which corresponds to option A.

Final Answer: A
