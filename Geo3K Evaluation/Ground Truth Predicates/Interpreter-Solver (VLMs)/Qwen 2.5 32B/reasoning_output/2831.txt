To solve this problem, we need to use properties of tangency, cyclic quadrilaterals, and the fact that certain points lie on specific circles.

Firstly, note that points $E$, $F$, $C$, and $D$ lie on a circle centered at point $E$ with radius 4. This implies that triangles $AEC$ and $DEF$ are similar by AA similarity (angle-angle similarity).

Since $A$ and $B$ are on a circle with center $E$, and given the lengths $AB = 15$, $AD = x$, and the other side lengths, we can apply the Power of a Point theorem, which states that for a point outside a circle, the product of the segments of one secant line equals the product of the segments of another secant line. 

However, since the points lie on specific circles, and knowing the lengths and the tangency conditions, we can simplify our approach by using the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and the fact that the distances between the points and their positions relative to the circles provide enough information to find $x$.

Let's denote the lengths as follows:
- $AB = 15$
- $AD = x$
- $AF = y$ (let us calculate $y$ first)

We know $AE = 4$ and $EB = 4$ because they are radii of the circle centered at $E$. Given that $AF = 12$, and considering the triangle $AFD$, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle $AFD$:

$$ AD^2 = AF^2 + FD^2 $$

Given that $FD = AB - AF = 15 - 12 = 3$, substituting into the equation gives:

$$ x^2 = 12^2 + 3^2 = 144 + 9 = 153 $$

So,

$$ x = \sqrt{153} \approx 12.37 $$

Rounding to the nearest tenth:

$$ x \approx 12.4 $$

Therefore, the closest choice is:
