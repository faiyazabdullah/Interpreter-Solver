QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**ANALYSIS AND EXTRACT:**
- The image shows a geometric figure with points Q, Q', B, C, and D.
- The length of segment QC is 5 units.
- The length of segment QC' is 15 units.
- Point Q lies on line Q'C.
- Point F lies on line BC.
- The problem asks to find the scale factor from Q to Q'.

**DEDUCTION:**
Given that Q lies on line Q'C and the length of Q'C is 15 units while QC is 5 units, we can deduce that Q is a scaling point such that the ratio of distances from Q to Q' and from Q to Q' is constant along this line segment.

Since Q' is a scaled version of Q along the line Q'C, if Q' is twice as far from Q as Q is from itself, then the scale factor would be 2.

Thus, the scale factor from Q to Q' is 2.

**CONCLUSION:**
Final Answer: A
