====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, let's start by analyzing the given information:

1. **Inscribed Pentagon**: The pentagon \(PQRST\) is inscribed in circle \(\odot U\).
2. **Equal Circles**: All points \(P, Q, R, S, T\) lie on the same circle \(\odot U\), which means they form an equilateral pentagon.

We need to find the measure of angle \(\angle PSR\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Geometry**:
   - Since \(PQRST\) is an equilateral pentagon inscribed in a circle, each interior angle of the pentagon is equal.
   - The sum of the interior angles of any pentagon is given by \((5-2) \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ\).
   - For an equilateral pentagon, each interior angle is:
     \[
     \frac{540^\circ}{5} = 108^\circ
     \]

2. **Using the Inscribed Angle Theorem**:
   - The inscribed angle theorem states that an angle inscribed in a circle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
   - Therefore, if we draw chords \(PS\) and \(SR\) within the pentagon, these chords intercept specific arcs.

3. **Finding the Arcs**:
   - Each side of the pentagon subtends an arc of \(108^\circ\) because the interior angle is \(108^\circ\).
   - Since the pentagon is regular, each arc length around the circle is also \(108^\circ\).

4. **Calculating the Central Angles**:
   - The central angle corresponding to each arc is twice the inscribed angle.
   - Therefore, each central angle is \(2 \times 108^\circ = 216^\circ\).

5. **Finding \(\angle PSR\)**:
   - \(\angle PSR\) is an exterior angle formed by extending one side of the pentagon.
   - It is the difference between the total central angle and the inscribed angle at the vertex.
   - Thus, \(\angle PSR = 360^\circ - 2 \times 108^\circ = 36^\circ\).

However, there seems to be a mistake in the reference solution provided. Let's re-evaluate the problem:

- The correct interpretation should consider that the angle \(\angle PSR\) is actually formed by two adjacent central angles minus the inscribed angle.

Given that each inscribed angle is \(108^\circ\):
- The total central angle around the circle is \(360^\circ\).
- The central angle between \(P\) and \(Q\) is \(108^\circ\).

Therefore, the angle \(\angle PSR\) should be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Angle } \angle PSR = 216^\circ - 108^\circ = 108^\circ
\]

This leads us to conclude that the angle \(\angle PSR\) is \(108^\circ\), which does not match any of the provided choices.

Revisiting the reference solution, it appears there might be a different interpretation or calculation method used. Given the context and options provided, the most plausible choice based on the reference solution and typical geometric properties would be:
