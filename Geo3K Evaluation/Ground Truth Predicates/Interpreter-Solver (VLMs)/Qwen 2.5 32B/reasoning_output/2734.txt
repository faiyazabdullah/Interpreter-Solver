QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Let's start by analyzing the given information:

1. Point \( D \) lies on line \( AB \).
2. The measure of \( \angle CDA = x \).
3. The measure of \( \angle BDC = \angle BCA \).
4. The measure of \( \angle BDC = \angle DCB \).

Since \( D \) lies on line \( AB \), we can consider the angles around point \( D \). 

Given that \( \angle BDC = \angle BCA \) and \( \angle BDC = \angle DCB \), we can infer that these angles share a common vertex \( D \) and are equal to each other. Additionally, since \( \angle BCA \) and \( \angle DCB \) are also equal, we have:

\[ \angle BCA = \angle DCB = \angle BDC \]

Now, let's analyze the angles in triangle \( BCD \):

1. Since \( D \) lies on line \( AB \), \( \angle BDC \) is a straight angle minus \( \angle BDA \).
2. Given that \( \angle BDA = 180^\circ - 2x \) (since \( \angle BDA \) is supplementary to \( \angle BDC \) which is equal to \( x \)).

Therefore, we have:

\[ \angle BCA = \angle DCB = \angle BDC = x \]

Now, considering the total sum of angles around point \( D \) in triangle \( BCD \):

\[ \angle BDC + \angle DCB + \angle BCA = 180^\circ \]

Substituting the values:

\[ x + x + x = 180^\circ \]
\[ 3x = 180^\circ \]
\[ x = 60^\circ \]

Thus, the measure of \( \angle CDA \) is \( 60^\circ \).
