**Step 1: Analyze and Extract**

The problem involves two similar trapezoids, \(J K L M\) and \(Q R S T\). The given information includes:
- Area of trapezoid \(J K L M = 138\) square feet.
- Area of trapezoid \(Q R S T = 5.52\) square feet.
- Length of \(JK = 5\) feet.
- Similarity of the trapezoids implies equal ratios of corresponding sides and areas.

**Step 2: Deduce Systematically**

Since the trapezoids are similar, the ratio of their areas equals the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths.

Let's denote the height of trapezoid \(J K L M\) as \(h_1\) and the height of trapezoid \(Q R S T\) as \(h_2\).

Given:
\[ \frac{\text{Area of } J K L M}{\text{Area of } Q R S T} = \left(\frac{h_1}{h_2}\right)^2 \]

Substitute the known values:
\[ \frac{138}{5.52} = \left(\frac{h_1}{h_2}\right)^2 \]
\[ \frac{138}{5.52} = \frac{2700}{1100} = \frac{27}{11} \]

Therefore:
\[ \left(\frac{h_1}{h_2}\right)^2 = \frac{27}{11} \]
\[ \frac{h_1}{h_2} = \sqrt{\frac{27}{11}} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{11}} = \frac{3\sqrt{33}}{11} \]

Next, we need to find the length of \(x\), which represents the length of \(QT\) (the parallel sides of the trapezoid). Since the trapezoids are similar:

\[ \frac{x}{5} = \frac{12}{11} \]
\[ x = \frac{60}{11} \approx 5.45 \]

However, the options provided are whole numbers, so we approximate \(x\) to match one of the options:

Given the choices, the closest value to \(5.45\) is \(5.5\), which corresponds to choice B.

**Step 3: Conclude and Select**

Final Answer: B
