Given the conditions of the problem:

1. **Identify key elements**: The diagram shows points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), \( D \), \( E \), and \( F \). We know that \( A \) is connected to \( B \) and \( C \) with lengths \( AB = 6 \), \( BC = 7.5 \), \( AC = 9 \), and \( DE = 9 \). Additionally, \( B \) lies on \( AD \), and \( F \) is the intersection of lines \( BF \) and \( AC \).

2. **Deduce systematically**:
   - From the given lengths, we can calculate \( AD = AC + CD = AC + BC = 9 + 7.5 = 16.5 \).
   - Since \( F \) is the intersection of \( BF \) and \( AC \), and considering \( B \) divides \( AC \) into two segments \( AB \) and \( BC \), we can use the fact that \( F \) is the midpoint of the angle bisector of \( \angle ABC \).
   - Given \( \angle ABD = \angle FBC \), we can deduce that \( BD \) is the same distance as \( BC \) because they are corresponding sides of similar triangles formed by the angle bisector theorem.

3. **Conclude and select**:
   - Since \( F \) is the midpoint of the angle bisector, we conclude that \( BD = BC = 7.5 \).

Therefore, the final answer is:

Final Answer: B
