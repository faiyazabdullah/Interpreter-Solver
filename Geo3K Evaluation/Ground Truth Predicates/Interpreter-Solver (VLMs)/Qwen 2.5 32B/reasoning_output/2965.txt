QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the lengths of the sides of triangle \( \triangle WXY \). Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify Key Elements:**
   - We have three sides: \( WX = 9x \), \( XY = 6x + 3 \), and \( YX = 4x + 5 \).
   - We also know that the length of \( XY \) is equal to the length of \( WX \) because they are corresponding sides of two congruent triangles sharing a common vertex at \( X \).

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Since \( WX = XY \):
     \[
     9x = 6x + 3
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract \( 6x \) from both sides:
     \[
     3x = 3
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 3:
     \[
     x = 1
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 1 \) into the expressions for the side lengths:
     \[
     WX = 9 \cdot 1 = 9
     \]
     \[
     XY = 6 \cdot 1 + 3 = 9
     \]
     \[
     YX = 4 \cdot 1 + 5 = 9
     \]

Since the lengths match, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:** A
