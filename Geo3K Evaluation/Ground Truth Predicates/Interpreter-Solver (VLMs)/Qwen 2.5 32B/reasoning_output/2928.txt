**ANALYSIS:**  
Given the problem setup, we need to find the length of CF given several conditions. Let's systematically work through the information provided.

1. **Identify Key Elements:**
   - Point LIES_ON_LINE(C, Line(B, D)) indicates C lies on line BD.
   - Point LIES_ON_LINE(F, Line(B, E)) implies F lies on line BE.
   - Point LIES_ON_LINE(F, Line(A, C)) means F lies on line AC.
   - Parallel(Line(A, C), Line(E, D)) states AC is parallel to ED.
   - Equal(LengthOf(Line(B, A)), 6) means BA = 6.
   - Equal(LengthOf(Line(B, C)), 7.5) means BC = 7.5.
   - Equal(LengthOf(Line(A, C)), 9) means AC = 9.
   - Equal(LengthOf(Line(D, E)), 9) means DE = 9.
   - BisectAngle(Line(B, F), Angle(A, B, C)) indicates BF bisects âˆ ABC.
   - MeasureOf(Angle(A, B, F)) = MeasureOf(Angle(F, B, C)) suggests F is the midpoint of BC because it bisects the angle at B.

2. **Systematic Deduction:**
   - Since F is the midpoint of BC and AC is parallel to ED, and considering the equal lengths provided, we can deduce that:
     - AF = FC because F is the midpoint.
     - Since AC = 9 and AB = 6, point A is 3 units away from C along AC.
   - Because AC is parallel to ED and DE = 9, the distance between points A and D should be equivalent when projected onto AC and ED due to their parallelism.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the symmetry and parallelism, the length of CF would logically be half of AC, as F is the midpoint of BC, and since AC = 9, CF should be half of AC.
   - Therefore, CF = 4.5.
