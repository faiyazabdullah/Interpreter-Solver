Let's begin by analyzing the given information and using it to find \(m \angle ZAC\).

1. **Identify Key Elements**: We know that quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is inscribed in \(\odot Z\). This means that all four vertices of the quadrilateral lie on the circumference of the circle. The angles and arc measures are given, and we have parallel lines and specific points on the circle.

2. **Given Information**:
   - \(\angle BZA = 104^\circ\)
   - \(\widehat{CB} = 94^\circ\)
   - \(AB \parallel DC\)

3. **Step-by-Step Deduction**:

   - Since \(AB \parallel DC\) and they are chords of the circle, the angle subtended by them at any point on the circle is equal. Therefore, \(\angle ZAC = \angle ZBA\).
   
   - From the circle property, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. So, \(\angle ZBA = \frac{1}{2} \times \widehat{BC} = \frac{1}{2} \times 94^\circ = 47^\circ\).

   - Now, since \(\angle BZA = 104^\circ\) and \(\angle ZBA = 47^\circ\), the measure of \(\angle ZAC\) is the same as \(\angle ZBA\) because they are alternate interior angles formed by the transversal \(AZ\) intersecting the parallel lines \(AB\) and \(DC\).

So, \(m \angle ZAC = 47^\circ\).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The measure of \(\angle ZAC\) is \(47^\circ\).

Therefore, the correct choice is \(B\).
