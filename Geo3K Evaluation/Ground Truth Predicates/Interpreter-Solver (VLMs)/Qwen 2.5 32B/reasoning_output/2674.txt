QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Given the problem setup and the information provided, let's analyze it step-by-step:

1. **Analyze & Extract:**
   - We have a circle with center \(F\) and points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\), and \(E\) lying on this circle.
   - The measure of \(\angle DFA\) is given as \(50^\circ\).
   - \(CF\) is perpendicular to \(FB\).

2. **Deduce Systematically:**
   - Since \(CF\) is perpendicular to \(FB\), \(\angle CFB = 90^\circ\). This implies \(\angle CFA = 90^\circ\) because they form right angles at point \(F\).
   - The measure of \(\angle DFA\) is given as \(50^\circ\).
   - We need to find the measure of \(\widehat{ACD}\), which includes \(\angle CAD\) and \(\angle CDA\).

3. **Combine Multiple Predicates to Reveal New Relationships:**
   - Since \(A\) and \(B\) lie on the circle, \(\angle AFB = 180^\circ\) because they subtend a straight line on the circle.
   - Therefore, \(\angle CFA = 90^\circ\) means that \(CF\) bisects \(\angle CFB\) into two \(45^\circ\) angles since \(\angle CFB = 90^\circ\).
   - Thus, \(\angle CFD = \angle CFA - \angle DFA = 90^\circ - 50^\circ = 40^\circ\).
   - Similarly, \(\angle CDA = \angle CDF = 40^\circ\).

4. **Calculate the Final Measure:**
   - To find \(\widehat{ACD}\), we sum the measures of \(\angle CAD\) and \(\angle CDA\):
     \[
     \text{Measure of } \widehat{ACD} = \angle CAD + \angle CDA = 40^\circ + 40^\circ = 80^\circ.
     \]

However, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the options provided. Given the problem constraints and the measure found, none of the provided choices match our calculated result of \(80^\circ\). 

It seems there might be an error in the options or the problem statement. If the problem indeed requires finding \(\widehat{ACD}\) based on the given conditions, the closest answer would be:

Final Answer: B
