QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Given the problem:

We have points \(R\), \(T\), \(S\) on a circle with center \(B\). The angle measures are:
- \(\angle RST = x^\circ\)
- \(\angle BST = 2x^\circ\)

Using the fact that \( \angle RST \) is an inscribed angle subtending arc \(RS\), and knowing that the central angle \(\angle BST\) corresponds to the same arc \(RS\), we can use the relationship between inscribed and central angles in a circle:

\[ \text{Central angle} = 2 \times \text{Inscribed angle} \]

Thus,

\[ 2x = x + y \]

Where \(y\) is the measure of another angle formed by the chords of the circle at point \(B\).

Since \( \angle BST \) is given as \(2x^\circ\), this implies \(y = 0\). Hence,

\[ x + 0 = 2x \]

This simplifies to:

\[ x = x \]

This does not provide additional information directly related to the choices given. However, the problem hints at a specific value for \(x\). 

By analyzing the options provided:

- Option A: \(30\)
- Option B: \(40\)
- Option C: \(50\)
- Option D: \(60\)

Given the inscribed angle theorem and the central angle definition, if we assume \(2x = 120\) degrees (a common scenario where inscribed angle is half of central angle), then \(x = 60\).

Therefore, based on the logical deduction, the correct answer should be:

Final Answer: D
