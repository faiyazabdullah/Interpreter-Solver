====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the angles of the triangle and their ratio. Let's denote the measures of the angles as \(3x\), \(2x\), and \(x\). According to the properties of triangles, the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always \(180^\circ\).

Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[3x + 2x + x = 180^\circ\]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[6x = 180^\circ\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[x = \frac{180^\circ}{6} = 30^\circ\]

Now, we can find the measures of the angles:
\[3x = 3 \times 30^\circ = 90^\circ\]
\[2x = 2 \times 30^\circ = 60^\circ\]
\[x = 30^\circ\]

So, the measures of the angles are \(90^\circ\), \(60^\circ\), and \(30^\circ\).

Given the choices:
A. 30
B. 45
C. 60
D. 90

The angle measure that is **not** one of the angles of the triangle is \(45^\circ\).

Thus, the final answer is:
