QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Given the problem:

- Points \( A, B, C, D, \) and \( E \) form a configuration where \( AE = 3 \), \( AB = 2 \), \( BC = 6 \), \( ED = 2x - 3 \), \( E \) lies on \( AD \), and \( B \) lies on \( AC \).
- Lines \( DC \parallel EB \).

We need to find the value of \( x \) such that these conditions hold true.

Let's start by analyzing the given information:

1. **Given Conditions:**
   - \( AE = 3 \)
   - \( AB = 2 \)
   - \( BC = 6 \)
   - \( ED = 2x - 3 \)
   - \( E \) lies on \( AD \)
   - \( B \) lies on \( AC \)
   - \( DC \parallel EB \)

2. **Visual Analysis:**
   - Since \( DC \parallel EB \), triangles \( ABD \) and \( ABC \) share similar properties due to their parallel sides and equal segments.

3. **Using Similar Triangles:**
   - From the similarity of triangles, we can establish the following proportion based on segment lengths:
     \[
     \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{AD}{AE}
     \]
   
4. **Finding \( AD \):**
   - We know \( AB = 2 \) and \( BC = 6 \). Let \( AD = y \).
   - Since \( E \) is on \( AD \), \( AE = 3 \) implies \( AD = AE + ED = 3 + (2x - 3) = 2x \).

5. **Applying Similarity Condition:**
   - Using the proportion:
     \[
     \frac{2}{2x} = \frac{y}{3}
     \]

6. **Finding \( y \):**
   - Solve for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{3 \cdot 2}{2x} = \frac{6}{2x} = \frac{3}{x}
     \]

7. **Using Parallelism and Length Relationship:**
   - Since \( DC \parallel EB \), the segments created by the parallel lines have proportional segments. Hence:
     \[
     \frac{DC}{EB} = \frac{AD}{AE} = \frac{2x}{3}
     \]
   - Given \( DC = AD - AC = 2x - 6 \) and \( EB = AB + AC = 2 + 6 = 8 \), we equate the proportions:
     \[
     \frac{2x - 6}{8} = \frac{2x}{3}
     \]

8. **Solving for \( x \):**
   - Cross-multiply to solve:
     \[
     3(2x - 6) = 8(2x)
     \]
     \[
     6x - 18 = 16x
     \]
     \[
     18 = 10x
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{18}{10} = 1.8
     \]

Since the solution does not match the choices provided, there might be an error in the problem setup or interpretation. However, based on the given options, none of them fit the calculated value. Therefore, we conclude that the problem setup might need re-evaluation.

Final Answer: None of the options match the calculated value.
