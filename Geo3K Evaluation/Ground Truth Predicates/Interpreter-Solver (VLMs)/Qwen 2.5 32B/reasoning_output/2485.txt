====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's analyze the given information and use it to find the measure of angle \( \angle AEB \).

1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have a rhombus \(ABCD\) with side lengths \(AB = 2x + 3\) and \(BC = 5x\).
   - Point \(E\) lies on the lines \(AC\) and \(BD\) such that \(AE\) is equal to some segment on \(AC\) and \(BE\) is equal to some segment on \(BD\).

2. **Deduction Systematically:**
   - Since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, all sides are equal. Therefore, \(AB = BC = AD = CD\).
   - From the equality \(AB = BC\), we can set up the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3 = 5x
     \]
   - Solving this equation gives us:
     \[
     2x + 3 = 5x \implies 3 = 3x \implies x = 1
     \]
   - Substituting \(x = 1\) back into the expressions for the sides of the rhombus, we get:
     \[
     AB = BC = AD = CD = 2(1) + 3 = 5
     \]

3. **Finding \( \angle AEB \):**
   - In a rhombus, diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Therefore, \(AC\) and \(BD\) are perpendicular.
   - Since \(E\) lies on both diagonals, it forms two right angles at \(E\):
     \[
     \angle AEC = 90^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \angle BEC = 90^\circ
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since \( \angle AEB \) is formed by combining these right angles, we have:
     \[
     \angle AEB = 90^\circ
     \]

Therefore, the measure of angle \( \angle AEB \) is \(90^\circ\).
