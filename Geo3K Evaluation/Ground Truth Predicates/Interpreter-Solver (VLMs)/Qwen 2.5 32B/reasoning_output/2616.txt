**ANALYSIS AND EXTRACT**

Key elements identified:
- Tangency points at G, H, and K with circle centered at A
- Length of JK = 6
- Length of HJ = 4
- Point H lies on line segment GH
- Circle center A is common for all three points G, H, and K
- We need to find length GH (x)

**DEDUCTION**

From the given information:
- Triangle HJK is a right triangle because it is inscribed in a circle where the hypotenuse is the diameter.
- Therefore, JK^2 + HK^2 = HJ^2

Using Pythagoras theorem in triangle HJK:

\[ JK^2 + HK^2 = HJ^2 \]
\[ 6^2 + HK^2 = 4^2 \]
\[ 36 + HK^2 = 16 \]
\[ HK^2 = 16 - 36 \]
\[ HK^2 = -20 \]

This result indicates there's an error in the problem setup or interpretation since lengths cannot be negative or imaginary in real geometry. Let's re-evaluate using proper geometric relationships and logic.

Given point H lies on line segment GH and the circle's radius is constant, letâ€™s reconsider the construction:

- Since GKH is a right triangle (right angle at H due to inscribed property), apply the Pythagorean theorem again:
\[ HK^2 = GK^2 - KH^2 \]

Here, we need to find \(GH\) which is equal to \(HK\).

Since \(GK\) and \(KH\) are parts of the same circle with radius 4, their combined length equals the diameter minus the other two sides forming the triangle.

Let's solve using correct geometric properties:

We have:
\[ GK + KH = 8 \]

Given \(HJ = 4\) and \(JK = 6\):
\[ HK = \sqrt{GK^2 - KH^2} \]

Using the circle radius, \(GK + KH = 8\):

So, \(GH = HK\), and solving gives us:

\[ GH = \sqrt{16 - 12} = \sqrt{4} = 2 \]

But this doesn't align correctly as we assumed GH=HK. Reassessing the problem might require different interpretation or geometric properties rechecked.

**CONCLUSION AND SELECT**

Rechecking the problem setup and applying the correct geometric principles shows GH is actually derived differently but assuming the correct interpretation and solution process:

\[ GH = \sqrt{(8-6)^2 + (4-6)^2} \]

Thus, \( GH = \sqrt{4+4} = \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2} \approx 2.828 \)

This does not match provided choices directly, suggesting a possible misinterpretation or error in original problem data or solution approach.

Correct solution based on proper interpretation should give a value fitting into given choices. Given the discrepancy, re-evaluation or recheck needed for accurate conclusion.
