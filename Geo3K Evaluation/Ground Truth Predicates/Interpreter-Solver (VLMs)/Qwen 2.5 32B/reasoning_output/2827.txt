====================================================================================================
**1. ANALYZE & EXTRACT**
- From the given information, we have a rhombus ABCD with equal sides AB = BC = CD = DA.
- We know that m∠DAB = 2x and m∠ADC = 2x based on the predicate "Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,B)), Mul(MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,C)),2))."
- Length of AB = BC = CD = DA = 6 units, as stated in the predicate "Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,B)),6)" and "Equals(LengthOf(Line(B, C)), 6)."

**2. DEDUCE SYSTEMATICALLY**
- Since ABCD is a rhombus, all its angles are equal, so m∠DAB = m∠ABC = m∠BCD = m∠CDA = x.
- Given m∠DAB = 2x, it follows that x = 2.
- Therefore, m∠DAB = m∠ABC = m∠BCD = m∠CDA = 2x = 4.
- Since E lies on AD and BE is a diagonal, we use properties of rhombuses where diagonals bisect each other at right angles.
- Thus, BE forms two right angles with AD (as it's a rhombus).
- Let m∠ADB = y.
- As AD and BD are opposite angles in a parallelogram formed by the intersection of the diagonals, and considering the rhombus properties, m∠ADB = m∠DBC.
- So, m∠DBC = y.

**3. CONCLUDE & SELECT**
- From the properties of the rhombus and the right-angle intersections, we know that m∠ADC = m∠DBC = 4, making the angle between AD and BD half of m∠DAB which is 2, thus m∠ADB = 2.
- This means m∠BAD = 4, confirming m∠ADB = 2, but considering the problem constraints, we need to find the angle at point D relative to the whole triangle, hence m∠ADB = 2x = 8.
- However, this seems incorrect given the options provided. Rechecking confirms m∠ADB should be directly related to the properties of rhombus angles and the specific options.
- Given the constraints and choices, the angle must align with one of these options.

Therefore, re-evaluating, m∠ADB = 2 * x = 4, aligning with our understanding of rhombus properties, and considering the options provided, the correct answer aligns with the properties of angles in rhombi, specifically the relationship between internal angles and diagonals.
