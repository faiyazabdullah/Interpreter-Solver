**BEGIN ANALYSIS**

Let's denote the lengths of the diagonals as \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \), where \( d_1 = 2d_2 \).

Given that the area of the rhombus is 169 square millimeters, we know that the area \( A \) can be expressed as:
\[ A = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2 \]

Substituting \( d_1 = 2d_2 \) into the equation gives us:
\[ 169 = \frac{1}{2} \times 2d_2 \times d_2 \]
\[ 169 = d_2^2 \]
\[ d_2 = \sqrt{169} \]
\[ d_2 = 13 \]

Therefore,
\[ d_1 = 2d_2 = 2 \times 13 = 26 \]

So, the lengths of the diagonals are 26 millimeters and 13 millimeters respectively.
