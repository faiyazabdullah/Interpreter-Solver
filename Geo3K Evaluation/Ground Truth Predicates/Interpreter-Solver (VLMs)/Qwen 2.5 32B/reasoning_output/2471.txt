Let's analyze the given trapezoid ABED with vertices labeled as A, B, C, and D. 

To find the area of this trapezoid, we need to calculate the height of the trapezoid first. We know that the length of the shorter base AD is 22 feet, the longer base BC is 37 feet, and the height can be found by considering the right triangle formed by the height, part of the longer base, and the segment connecting points D and E which is equal to the height.

Since the problem states that PointE lies on LineBC, the height is equal to the length of LineAE, which is 23 feet.

Now let's use these values to find the area of the trapezoid using the formula:

Area = 0.5 * (Base1 + Base2) * Height

Where Base1 = 22 ft, Base2 = 37 ft, and Height = 23 ft.

So,

Area = 0.5 * (22 + 37) * 23
     = 0.5 * 59 * 23
     = 29 * 23
     = 667 ftÂ²

Therefore, the area of the trapezoid is 667 square feet.
