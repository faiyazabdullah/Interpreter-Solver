**ANALYSIS AND EXTRACTED DATA:**
- Length of DB = 24
- Length of AE = 3
- Length of EC = 18
- Points D and B lie on Line AB
- Point E lies on Line AC
- Parallel lines DE and BC

**QUESTION:**
Find AD given the above conditions.

**DEDUCTION SYSTEMATICALLY:**

From the given lengths and parallelism, we can use the properties of triangles and the fact that DE is parallel to BC to establish similar triangles.

Since DE is parallel to BC, triangle ADE is similar to triangle ABC by AA similarity (Angle-Angle Similarity).

This implies:
\[ \frac{AD}{AB} = \frac{AE}{AC} = \frac{DE}{BC} \]

Given that AE = 3 and EC = 18, we have:
\[ AC = AE + EC = 3 + 18 = 21 \]
Therefore,
\[ \frac{AE}{AC} = \frac{3}{21} = \frac{1}{7} \]

Using the similarity ratio, we can find AD as follows:
\[ AD = AB \cdot \frac{1}{7} \]

However, since we don't know AB directly but know DE is parallel to BC and thus proportional to BC, we need another way to relate AB to DE.

Given DE is parallel to BC and DE = 3, we need to find BC. Since AB = AD + DB = AD + 24, we need to find AD such that the similarity holds.

We can use the fact that the ratio of corresponding sides in similar triangles is equal.

Let's solve this systematically:

1. From similarity, \( \frac{AE}{AC} = \frac{1}{7} \) and \( \frac{DE}{BC} = \frac{1}{7} \).
2. Since DE is parallel to BC, DE = 3 and BC = 21 (by proportionality).

Now, let's find AB using the length of DB:
\[ AB = AD + DB = AD + 24 \]

Since \( \frac{AE}{AC} = \frac{1}{7} \):
\[ \frac{3}{21} = \frac{1}{7} \]

Now, find AD:
\[ AD = AB \cdot \frac{1}{7} \]

We know \( AB = AD + 24 \), so:
\[ AD = AB \cdot \frac{1}{7} = (AB - 24) \cdot \frac{1}{7} \]

To find AB, use the fact that AB = AD + 24:
\[ AB = AD + 24 \]
\[ AB = 24 + 3 \cdot 7 = 24 + 21 = 45 \]

So, \( AD = 45 \cdot \frac{1}{7} = 6 \).

Therefore, AD = 6.
