Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - We have a rhombus ABCD.
   - The length of diagonal AC (which connects vertices A and C) is 22 mm.
   - The length of diagonal BD (which connects vertices B and D) is 12 mm.

2. **Understanding Rhombus Properties:**
   - In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other, and they also divide the rhombus into four congruent right triangles.

3. **Calculate the Area of the Rhombus:**
   - The area \( A \) of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2
     \]
     where \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \) are the lengths of the diagonals.

4. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Here, \( d_1 = 22 \) mm and \( d_2 = 12 \) mm.

5. **Perform the Calculation:**
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 22 \times 12
   \]

6. **Calculate the Final Answer:**
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 264 = 132
   \]

7. **Select the Correct Choice:**
   - The calculated area is 132 square millimeters, which corresponds to choice C.

Final Answer: C
