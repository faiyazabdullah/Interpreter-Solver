====================================================================================================
Let's start by analyzing the given geometric figure:

- We have points A, B, C, D, E, and G.
- The angles are labeled as follows:
  - ∠ADE = 30°
  - ∠AEB = 45°
- We need to find the length of segment AC, denoted as \(x\).
- Segment AE has a length of 8 units.
- Angle ADB is 30°.
- Perpendicular lines AG and AD are constructed.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Identify Key Elements:**
   - We know ∠ADE = 30° and ∠AEB = 45°.
   - Segment AE has a length of 8 units.
   - ∠ADB = 30°.
   - Lines AG and AD are perpendicular.

2. **Use Trigonometric Identities:**
   Since ∠AEB = 45°, we can use trigonometric identities to find the height of triangle ADE if necessary.

3. **Apply Right Triangles:**
   We know that the height from point E to line AD can be calculated using the properties of right triangles. Specifically, since ∠AEB = 45°, triangle ABE is a 45°-45°-90° triangle. In such a triangle, the legs are equal, so AB = BE = AE / √2 = 8 / √2 = 4√2.

4. **Calculate the Length of AC:**
   Since ∠ADE = 30° and angle AEB = 45°, we can use the fact that in a 30°-60°-90° triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. Therefore, if AE is the hypotenuse, then DE (opposite the 30° angle) will be half of AE, i.e., DE = 4.

5. **Find the Length of AC:**
   Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ADE:
   \[
   AC^2 = AE^2 - DE^2 = 8^2 - 4^2 = 64 - 16 = 48
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   AC = \sqrt{48} = 4\sqrt{3}
   \]

6. **Select the Correct Choice:**
   The length of AC is \(4\sqrt{3}\).

Therefore, the correct answer is:
