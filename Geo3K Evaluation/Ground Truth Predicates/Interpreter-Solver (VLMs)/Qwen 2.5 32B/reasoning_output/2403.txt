**Analysis:**

Given:
- ∠B = 54°
- BD = 32
- AB = y
- AC = BC
- Perpendicular (AB, AC)

Let's use the given information and properties of right triangles and isosceles triangles.

Step 1: Use the fact that angle at D is right (since it's a right triangle).
So, ∠D = 90°.

Step 2: Use the fact that AB is perpendicular to AC which implies triangle ABC is a right triangle at A.

Step 3: Since AB = AC and the angles are equal due to being symmetric around point A, this means ΔABC is isosceles and right-angled.

Step 4: Now, consider the angles in the triangle. We know one angle is 90° and another is 54°. Thus, we need to find the third angle using the property of triangles summing to 180°:

\[ \text{Sum of angles} = 180° \]
\[ \text{Therefore, } \angle C = 180° - 90° - 54° = 36° \]

Step 5: With angle C as 36°, we have two 30°-60°-90° right triangles forming when considering sides AB and AC relative to their hypotenuses AD and BC respectively.

Step 6: Since AB is opposite 36° and AC is opposite 54°, and knowing the relationship between sides in a 30°-60°-90° triangle where the longest side (hypotenuse) is twice the shortest side (opposite 30°), we can infer the relationship between AB and AC based on their respective angles.

Step 7: From the diagram and given angles, we see that BD is actually the hypotenuse of a right triangle formed by ∠B and the adjacent side AD. Therefore, we can calculate the length of BD using trigonometric ratios:

\[ BD = \frac{AD}{cos(\angle B)} \]
\[ AD = BD * cos(\angle B) \]
\[ AD = 32 * cos(54°) \]

Step 8: Using the cosine value for 54° (≈ 0.5592), we get:
\[ AD ≈ 32 * 0.5592 ≈ 17.4568 \]

Step 9: Given the symmetry and properties of the triangle, AD should be equal to the height of the isosceles triangle formed by AB and AC.

Step 10: As AB and AC form two similar right triangles sharing the same height AD but with different bases (which we don't directly calculate here but understand the ratio of similarity).

Step 11: Finally, recognizing the problem setup and choices, we identify the base length x as twice the height AD because in an isosceles triangle split by a perpendicular to the base, the base is twice the height.

\[ x = 2 * AD = 2 * 17.4568 ≈ 34.9136 \]

Since this does not match any provided options, I'll consider rounding to the nearest tenth which would be approximately 35.0.

However, upon rechecking, there seems to be a misinterpretation regarding the actual calculation and rounding necessary for the exact match to any provided options.
