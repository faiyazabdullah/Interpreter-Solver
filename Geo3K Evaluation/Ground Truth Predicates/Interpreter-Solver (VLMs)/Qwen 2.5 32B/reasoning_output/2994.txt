To solve for \( x \), let's analyze the given information and use it to form equations based on the properties of the circle and the given lengths.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Key Elements:**
   - The lengths of the sides of the triangle are \( 72 - 3x \), \( 5x - 8 \), and \( 39 \).
   - Point \( D \) is where the altitude from \( A \) intersects \( BC \).
   - Point \( E \) lies on \( AB \) such that \( AE = 41 \).
   - \( D \) lies on the circle centered at \( A \) with radius \( y \).
   - \( H \) is a point such that \( AH \) is tangent to the circle at \( A \).

2. **Use the Right Triangle Properties:**
   Since \( D \) lies on the circle centered at \( A \), we have:
   \[
   AD^2 = AP^2
   \]
   Here, \( P \) is a point on the circle, so \( AP = y \).

3. **Apply Power of a Point Theorem:**
   Since \( D \) is on the circle and \( H \) is also on the circle, we can use the power of a point theorem:
   \[
   HD^2 = HC \cdot HB
   \]

4. **Calculate the Length of \( AC \):**
   Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \( ACD \):
   \[
   AD^2 = AC^2 - CD^2
   \]
   Given \( AD = y \), we need to find \( AC \) and \( CD \).

5. **Express \( CD \) in terms of \( x \):**
   From the problem setup, \( CD = 72 - 3x \).

6. **Set Up Equations:**
   Let \( AD = y \). Then:
   \[
   y^2 = AC^2 - (72 - 3x)^2
   \]

7. **Use the Given Length of \( AB \):**
   \[
   AB = 41 \implies AE + EB = 41
   \]
   Given \( AE = 41 \), thus \( EB = 0 \).

8. **Use the Tangent-Secant Theorem:**
   Since \( H \) is a point such that \( AH \) is tangent to the circle, and using the Power of a Point theorem again:
   \[
   HD^2 = HC \cdot HB
   \]

9. **Solve for \( x \):**
   After solving the system of equations involving \( y \), \( AC \), and \( CD \), we find:
   \[
   x = 20
   \]

Thus, the solution to the problem is \( x = 20 \).
