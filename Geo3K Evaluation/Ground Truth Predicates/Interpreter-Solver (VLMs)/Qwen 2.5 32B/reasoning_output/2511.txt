QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Let's analyze the given triangle ABC where AB = 20 and AC = BC = x. Since AC = BC, triangle ABC is isosceles with the angle at C being the vertex angle.

Since AC = BC, angle ACB is equal to angle CAB. Let's denote angle ACB as θ.

By the Law of Cosines applied to triangle ACB:

\[ AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot BC \cdot \cos(\theta) \]

Given that AC = BC = x:

\[ x^2 = 20^2 + x^2 - 2 \cdot 20 \cdot x \cdot \cos(\theta) \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 0 = 400 - 40x \cos(\theta) \]

\[ 40x \cos(\theta) = 400 \]

\[ \cos(\theta) = \frac{400}{40x} = \frac{10}{x} \]

Since the triangle is isosceles and we have an acute angle at C, the cosine value will be positive. We need to find the value of x such that the triangle remains valid and the conditions are met.

Considering the properties of the isosceles triangle and the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180°, we know that:

\[ \theta = 90^\circ \text{ (since it's an isosceles right triangle)} \]

But since we are dealing with general cases, we use the Pythagorean theorem directly for simplicity here.

Using the Pythagorean theorem:

\[ x^2 + x^2 = 20^2 \]

\[ 2x^2 = 400 \]

\[ x^2 = 200 \]

\[ x = \sqrt{200} \]

\[ x \approx 14.14 \]

Rounding to the nearest tenth gives us approximately 14.1.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
