Let's analyze this problem systematically:

1. **Analyze & Extract:**  
   - The points \(P, Q, R, S\) form a rhombus inscribed in a circle. This means that all four vertices of the rhombus lie on the circumference of the circle, and opposite sides of the rhombus are equal.
   - Given that point \(C\) lies on lines \(R \rightarrow P\) and \(S \rightarrow Q\).
   - The problem asks to find the measure of \(\widehat{SP}\).

2. **Deduce Systematically:**  
   - Since \(P, Q, R, S\) are inscribed in a circle, they form a cyclic quadrilateral, meaning that the opposite angles sum up to \(180^\circ\). Therefore, \(\angle PSQ = 180^\circ - \angle PRQ\).
   - Because \(P, Q, R, S\) form a rhombus, opposite angles are equal, so \(\angle PRQ = \angle PSQ\).
   - Since \(\angle PSQ\) is subtended by chord \(RS\) and \(\angle PRQ\) is subtended by chord \(PS\), and because the angle subtended by a chord in a circle is half the central angle, we know that \(\angle PSQ = \angle PRQ\).
   - Since \(\angle PSQ = 180^\circ - \angle PRQ\) and \(\angle PSQ = \angle PRQ\), it follows that \(\angle PRQ = 90^\circ\).
   - Therefore, \(\angle PSQ = 90^\circ\).

3. **Conclude & Select:**  
   - The measure of \(\widehat{SP}\) is \(90^\circ\).
