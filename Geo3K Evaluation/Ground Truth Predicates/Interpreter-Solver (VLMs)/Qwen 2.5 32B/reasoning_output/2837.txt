====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of a parallelogram and the given lengths.

Firstly, let's identify the points and their corresponding distances:
- \( W \) to \( A \) = 10
- \( X \) to \( A \) = \( a - 7 \)
- \( Y \) to \( A \) = 2
- \( Z \) to \( A \) = \( 2b - 6 \)

Given that \( WZ \parallel XY \) and \( WX \parallel YZ \), and knowing that \( WX \) and \( YZ \) are equal in length because they are opposite sides of the parallelogram, we can infer that \( WX = YZ = a - 7 \).

Now, let's consider the distances between the other pairs of points:
- \( WX \) is the sum of \( WY \) and \( XY \):
\[ WX = WY + XY \]
Since \( WX = a - 7 \) and \( XY = 2 \), we have:
\[ a - 7 = WY + 2 \]

Similarly, \( YZ \) is the sum of \( YZ \) and \( ZY \):
\[ YZ = YZ + ZY \]
Since \( YZ = a - 7 \) and \( ZY = 2b - 6 \), we have:
\[ a - 7 = YZ + (2b - 6) \]

Since \( YZ = a - 7 \), we can substitute \( a - 7 \) for \( YZ \) in the second equation:
\[ a - 7 = (a - 7) + (2b - 6) \]
Simplifying the right side:
\[ a - 7 = a - 7 + 2b - 6 \]
\[ a - 7 = a - 13 + 2b \]
Subtracting \( a \) from both sides:
\[ -7 = -13 + 2b \]
Adding 13 to both sides:
\[ 6 = 2b \]
Dividing by 2:
\[ b = 3 \]

Now, substituting \( b = 3 \) back into the equation for \( ZY \):
\[ ZY = 2b - 6 = 2(3) - 6 = 6 - 6 = 0 \]

This means \( ZY \) is zero, which implies \( Y = Z \). Therefore, \( WX = WY + XY = 2 + 0 = 2 \), but since \( WX = a - 7 \), we have:
\[ a - 7 = 2 \]
Adding 7 to both sides:
\[ a = 9 \]

So, the value of \( a \) is 9.
