Let's begin the analysis.

1. **ANALYZE & EXTRACT**

   - Key elements: 
     - Angles at points A, B, and C.
     - Length of segment BC = 6 mm.
     - Angle ∠ABC = 240°.
     - Circle with center at point B and radius AB/BC.

2. **DEDUCE SYSTEMATICALLY**

   - From the given information, we know that ∠ABC = 240°, which means that ∠ABD = 180° - 240° = -60°, where D is another point on the circle such that ∠ABD = 180° - ∠ABC.
   
   - Since ∠ABC is outside the circle, we can use the fact that the angle subtended by arc AB at point C is half the central angle subtended by arc AB at point B.
   
   - The length of chord BC is 6 mm, and since the angle ∠ABC is 240°, the central angle subtended by arc AC at point B is 240° / 2 = 120°.
   
   - Now, we need to find the area of the sector formed by ∠ABC = 240°.
   
   - The area of the sector can be calculated using the formula \( \text{Area} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi r^2 \), where θ is the central angle in degrees and r is the radius.
   
   - First, we need to find the radius AB/BC.
   
3. **CONCLUDE & SELECT**

   - Let's calculate the area of the sector using the formula.
   - The central angle of the sector is 240°.
   - The length of the chord BC is 6 mm, so the radius AB/BC is 6 mm.
   
   - The area of the sector is \( \frac{240}{360} \times \pi \times 6^2 = \frac{2}{3} \times \pi \times 36 = 24\pi \).

   - Given that π ≈ 3.14, the area of the sector is approximately 24 * 3.14 = 75.36 mm².
   
   - Comparing this value to the options provided, the closest value is 75.36 mm².
   
   - Therefore, the correct answer is B.
