QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Given the triangle \( \triangle LMN \) is equilateral, we know that all sides are equal, and all angles are \(60^\circ\). Let's denote the length of each side by \( s \).

From the problem, we have two equations based on the side lengths:
\[ MP = 3x + 1 \]
\[ MN = 4x - 2 \]
Since \( MN = s \), we can equate these two expressions:
\[ s = 4x - 2 \]

Next, we use the fact that \( MP \) bisects \( LN \). Since \( \triangle LMN \) is equilateral, \( LNP \) forms a right triangle with \( \angle LPM = 90^\circ \) because \( MP \) is the altitude to the base \( LN \) of the equilateral triangle. Therefore, \( \triangle LPM \) is a 30-60-90 triangle. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the length of the side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle is half the hypotenuse, and the side opposite the \( 60^\circ \) angle is \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \) times the hypotenuse. Here, \( MP \) is the altitude, so:
\[ MP = \frac{s}{2} = \frac{4x - 2}{2} = 2x - 1 \]
However, we are given that \( MP = 3x + 1 \), so we set up the equation:
\[ 2x - 1 = 3x + 1 \]
Solving for \( x \):
\[ 2x - 1 = 3x + 1 \]
\[ -1 - 1 = 3x - 2x \]
\[ -2 = x \]
Thus, \( x = -2 \).

Now, we need to find the measure of \( \angle LPM \). Since \( \angle LPM = 90^\circ \), we know that the measure of \( \angle LPM \) is \( 90^\circ \), but we also know that \( \angle LPM \) is part of the equilateral triangle where the internal angle at \( P \) is \( 60^\circ \). Since \( \angle LPM \) is bisected into two \( 30^\circ \) angles, we can use the fact that the sum of angles around point \( P \) is \( 360^\circ \). Thus:
\[ \angle LPM = 60^\circ \]
So, \( 5y = 60^\circ \), and solving for \( y \):
\[ 5y = 60^\circ \]
\[ y = 12 \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:
\boxed{B}
