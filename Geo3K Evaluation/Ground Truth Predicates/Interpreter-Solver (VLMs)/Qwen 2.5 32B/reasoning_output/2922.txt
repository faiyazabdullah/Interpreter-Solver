====================================================================================================
To find the value of \( x \), let's analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify Key Elements:**
   - We have four points labeled as \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \).
   - There are two circles, one centered at \( E \) and another centered at some point outside the circle, but it does not affect our calculation directly.
   - Lines \( AC = 3x \), \( AD = x \), and \( BF = x + 2 \).

2. **Key Relationships:**
   - Point \( F \) lies on line segment \( BD \) such that \( DF = 8 \).
   - \( AC = 3x \) implies \( AB = 3x \) because \( AB + BC = AC \) and \( BC = CD \).
   - \( AD = x \) implies \( BD = x \) because \( BD = BA + AD \).

3. **Calculate \( BC \):**
   Since \( AC = 3x \) and \( AD = x \), we can express \( BC \) as \( BC = AC - AD = 3x - x = 2x \).

4. **Summarize Segments:**
   - \( AB = 3x \)
   - \( BD = x \)
   - \( DF = 8 \)

5. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   Since \( BD \) is a chord of the circle and \( D \) is the midpoint of the chord when \( AB \) is perpendicular to \( BD \) (as \( A \) and \( B \) are endpoints of the diameter), we use the fact that the length of the chord can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.

6. **Set Up the Equation:**
   Since \( DF = 8 \) and \( D \) is the midpoint of the chord, we need to calculate \( BD \). Letâ€™s denote \( BD = x \).

   Given that \( BD \) is a chord and considering the properties of the circle, we know \( BD \) must satisfy the chord length condition based on the Pythagorean theorem applied to the right triangle formed by half of the chord and the radii.

7. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Since \( BD \) is a chord and \( D \) is the midpoint, \( BD = x \) must satisfy the equation derived from the Pythagorean theorem considering the lengths given.

   Let's solve this systematically:
   - \( BD = x \) and \( DF = 8 \)
   - By the Pythagorean theorem, \( BD = \sqrt{(\text{radius}^2 - (\frac{BD}{2})^2)} \)
   - Given \( BD = x \) and \( DF = 8 \), we equate \( BD \) to the length provided in terms of \( x \).

   Solving the equation:
   \[
   x = \sqrt{16 - \left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2}
   \]
   Squaring both sides:
   \[
   x^2 = 16 - \frac{x^2}{4}
   \]
   Multiplying through by 4:
   \[
   4x^2 = 64 - x^2
   \]
   Combining like terms:
   \[
   5x^2 = 64
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x^2 = \frac{64}{5}
   \]
   Taking the square root:
   \[
   x = \sqrt{\frac{64}{5}} = \frac{8}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{8\sqrt{5}}{5}
   \]

   Simplifying further:
   \[
   x \approx 3.6
   \]

Given the options provided, the closest value to \( x \approx 3.6 \) is \( 4 \).

Thus, the correct answer is \( B \). 

Final Answer: B
