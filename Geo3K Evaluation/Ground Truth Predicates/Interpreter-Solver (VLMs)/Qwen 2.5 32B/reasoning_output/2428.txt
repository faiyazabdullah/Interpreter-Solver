Given the problem setup and the provided information, let's break down the solution systematically:

1. **Analyze and Extract Key Elements**: 
   - We have a regular polygon inscribed in a circle, with points labeled \(P, N, M, L, K, J, S\).
   - Point \(S\) lies on line \(KL\).
   - Points \(K\) and \(M\) lie on circles with center \(R\) and radius \(2\) (not explicitly stated, but implied by the context).
   - Perpendicularity condition: \( \perp \) indicates that \(S\) lies on the line \(KL\) and forms a right angle with some line passing through \(S\).

2. **Deduce Systematically**:
   - Since \(KL\) is a chord in the circle, we can deduce that the central angle subtended by the arc \(KL\) equals twice the inscribed angle (which is half the central angle).
   - Given the properties of a regular polygon inscribed in a circle, the central angle subtended by each side of the polygon will be equal to \(360^\circ / n\), where \(n\) is the number of sides of the polygon.

3. **Conclude and Select**:
   - Since \(K\) and \(M\) are equidistant from \(R\) (circle radius), they form an equilateral triangle with \(R\). This implies that \(KM = KR = MK = 2\).
   - Considering \(KL\) as a chord of the circle, and knowing that \(KL\) divides the circle into two arcs, and considering the properties of regular polygons, the central angle corresponding to the side length (or the inscribed angle) would be \(360^\circ / 6 = 60^\circ\) (since it is divided into 6 equal parts).
   - Therefore, the central angle of the regular polygon inscribed in the circle would be \(60^\circ\).
