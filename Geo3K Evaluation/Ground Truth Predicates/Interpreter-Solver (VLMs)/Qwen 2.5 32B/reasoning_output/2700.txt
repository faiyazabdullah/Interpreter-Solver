====================================================================================================
To find the area of the given rectangle, we need to use the information provided by the figure and the predicates.

Firstly, let's identify the key points and angles:
- The length of sides AD and AB are both 15 mm.
- The angle at point C is 30°.
- Line AC is perpendicular to line AB (which implies that the rectangle has right angles).

Given that one side is 15 mm and the angle at point C is 30°, we can determine the height of the rectangle using trigonometric functions. 

Let's denote the height as h. Since the angle is 30°, we know that:

\[ \sin(30°) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{h}{15} \]

Using the value of sine for 30° which is 0.5:

\[ 0.5 = \frac{h}{15} \]

\[ h = 0.5 \times 15 \]
\[ h = 7.5 \]

So the height of the rectangle is 7.5 mm.

Now we can calculate the area of the rectangle:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{height} \]
\[ \text{Area} = 15 \times 7.5 \]
\[ \text{Area} = 112.5 \]

Therefore, the area of the figure rounded to the nearest tenth is 112.5 square millimeters.
