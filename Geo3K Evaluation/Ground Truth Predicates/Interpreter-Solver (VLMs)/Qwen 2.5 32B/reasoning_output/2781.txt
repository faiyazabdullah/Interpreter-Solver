====================================================================================================
Given:
- Rhombus ABCD
- Measure of angle ABC = 70 degrees
- Point E lies on AB such that AE = EB
- Line DE is parallel to line AC
- Line CE is perpendicular to line AD

To find:
- Measure of angle 1

Step-by-step solution:

1. **Identify Key Relationships:**
   - Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal.
   - Since point E is the midpoint of AB, AE = EB.
   - Since DE is parallel to AC and CE is perpendicular to AD, triangle ACD is right-angled at C.

2. **Calculate Angle ADE:**
   - Since DE is parallel to AC and CE is perpendicular to AD, angle ADE = angle CAE because they are corresponding angles.
   - Since triangle ACD is right-angled at C, angle CAD = 90 - angle ADC.
   - Since angle ADC = angle ABC = 70 degrees, angle CAD = 90 - 70 = 20 degrees.

3. **Determine Angle 1:**
   - Since AE = EB, angle 1 is half of angle CAD because E is the midpoint and triangles ADE and BCE are congruent by SAS (Side-Angle-Side).
   - Therefore, measure of angle 1 = 20 degrees / 2 = 10 degrees.

Since we have reached a contradiction with the given options, let's re-evaluate using properties of rhombuses and the fact that the diagonals bisect each other at right angles.

### Correct Analysis:
1. **Properties of Rhombus:**
   - Diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.
   - Therefore, angle AEC = 90 degrees because E is the midpoint and CE is perpendicular to AD.
   - Since angle AEC = 90 degrees and angle ABC = 70 degrees, angle BAE = 180 - 90 - 70 = 20 degrees.

2. **Determine Angle 1:**
   - Since angle BAE = 20 degrees and E is the midpoint of AB, angle 1 = 2 * angle BAE = 40 degrees.

However, this does not match any of the provided options. Let's reconsider the problem with a different approach based on the correct properties and relationships.

### Re-evaluation:
1. **Angle Relationships:**
   - Since angle ABC = 70 degrees and triangle ABD is isosceles (AB = AD), angle ADB = 70 degrees.
   - Since DE is parallel to AC and CE is perpendicular to AD, angle ADE = angle CAE = 70 degrees.
   - Since triangle ACD is right-angled at C, angle CAD = 90 - angle ADC = 90 - 70 = 20 degrees.

2. **Correct Angle Calculation:**
   - Since angle ADE = 70 degrees and E is the midpoint of AB, angle 1 = 2 * angle ADE = 140 degrees / 2 = 70 degrees.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
