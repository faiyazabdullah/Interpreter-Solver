====================================================================================================
To solve this problem systematically, we need to identify which angles are supplementary to angle 1 based on the given information about parallel lines, intersecting lines, and the measures of certain angles.

First, let's identify the angles that can be considered supplementary to angle 1. Two angles are supplementary if their sum equals 180 degrees.

Given:
- Angle 1 is one of the angles formed by the intersection of line \( n \) and line \( l \).
- Line \( n \) intersects line \( l \) at point \( D \).
- Angle 1 is adjacent to angles 2, 3, and 4.
- Since line \( n \) intersects both lines \( l \) and \( m \), and knowing that lines \( l \) and \( m \) are parallel, we can use properties of alternate interior angles and corresponding angles.

Let's analyze the angles:

1. **Angle 2**: This is adjacent to angle 1 and is also adjacent to angle 3.
   - Since \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 2 \) are consecutive angles formed by the transversal \( n \) intersecting \( l \), they are supplementary.
   - Therefore, \( \angle 1 + \angle 2 = 180^\circ \).

2. **Angle 3**: This is adjacent to angle 1 and is also adjacent to angle 4.
   - Similarly, since \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 3 \) are consecutive angles formed by the transversal \( n \) intersecting \( l \), they are supplementary.
   - Therefore, \( \angle 1 + \angle 3 = 180^\circ \).

3. **Angles 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9**: These angles are formed by different transversals and do not directly relate to \( \angle 1 \) without additional context or specific measures.

Since angles 2 and 3 are supplementary to \( \angle 1 \), and considering the provided options, the correct list should include these two angles.

**Final Answer: B**
