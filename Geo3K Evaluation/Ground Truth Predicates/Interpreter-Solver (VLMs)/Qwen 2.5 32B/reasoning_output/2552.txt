Given the geometric figure and the provided information:

1. **Analyze and Extract Key Elements:**
   - From the predicate: `Equal(MeasureOf(Angle(E, A, D)), 60)`
     - This implies ∠AED = 60°
   - From the predicate: `Equal(MeasureOf(Angle(D, E, A)), 40)`
     - This implies ∠ADE = 40°
   - From the predicate: `Equal(MeasureOf(Angle(B, E, C)), 80)`
     - This implies ∠BEC = 80°
   - From the predicate: `Equal(MeasureOf(Angle(E, B, A)), 70)`
     - This implies ∠BAE = 70°
   - From the predicate: `Equal(MeasureOf(Angle(E, C, B)), 60)`
     - This implies ∠BCE = 60°
   - Point LIESONLINE(E, LINE(D, C))

2. **Systematic Deduction:**
   - Since ∠BAE = 70° and ∠BAE + ∠AED = 180° (since they form a linear pair):
     - ∠AED = 180° - 70° = 110°
   - Given ∠ADE = 40°, this can be verified as ∠AED = 180° - ∠ADE = 180° - 40° = 140°, which is consistent.
   - Since ∠BEC = 80° and ∠BCE = 60°, ∠EBC = 180° - 80° - 60° = 40°.
   - Given ∠BAE = 70° and ∠EBC = 40°, these angles are not directly related to any parallel lines in the current setup.
   - We need to identify if any segments are parallel based on the given angles.

3. **Conclusion and Selection:**
   - The problem requires identifying which segments are parallel. Based on the angle measures and the provided conditions, we can see that:
     - ∠BAE and ∠BCE are not relevant to identifying parallel lines as they do not form corresponding or alternate interior angles necessary for proving parallelism.
     - ∠AED and ∠DEC are supplementary, but do not provide enough information about parallel lines.
     - ∠ADE = 40° and ∠BEC = 80°, but these angles alone do not indicate parallel lines without more context or additional angles.

   However, based on the provided information and the typical properties of angles, it seems that segment AD might be parallel to segment BC due to the supplementary angles and the fact that ∠ADE = 40° and ∠BEC = 80° suggest a right angle at point E.

**Final Answer: B**
