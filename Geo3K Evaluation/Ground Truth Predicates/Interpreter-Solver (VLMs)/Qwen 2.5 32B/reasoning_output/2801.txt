**ANALYSIS:**

From the given information, we can see that quadrilateral ABCD is a parallelogram. Therefore, opposite sides are equal, so AB = CD = 10, AD = BC = 13. We also know that the measure of angle ADF is 59° and angle ACB is 49°.

Since angle ACB is given as 49°, and it's an internal angle of triangle ACD, we can use this information to deduce the measures of other angles.

Using the property of parallelograms, we know that opposite angles are equal and adjacent angles sum up to 180 degrees.

Let's denote the measure of angle ACB as \(x\). Since angle ACB is part of triangle ACD, and we have the measure of angle ADF which is 59°, we can deduce the measure of angle ACD using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°:

\[ x + 59^\circ + \text{angle ADC} = 180^\circ \]

Therefore,
\[ x + 59^\circ + 49^\circ = 180^\circ \]
\[ x = 180^\circ - 59^\circ - 49^\circ \]
\[ x = 72^\circ \]

So, the measure of angle ACB is 72°.

Now let's analyze the choices:
- Choice A: 20 (This is incorrect as it doesn't match our calculation.)
- Choice B: 29 (This is incorrect as it's not a possible value based on our calculation.)
- Choice C: 49 (This is incorrect because it’s not the measure of angle ACB but rather angle BAC.)
- Choice D: 59 (This is incorrect as it’s not the measure of angle ACB.)

**CONCLUSION:**

The correct measure of angle ACB is 72°, but since the question asks for angle ACB, which is actually angle ACD due to properties of parallelograms, we need to subtract this angle from the total angle at point C, which is 180°.

Therefore, angle ACD = 180° - angle ACB = 180° - 72° = 108°

However, none of the given choices match this result directly. Given the constraints and choices provided, there seems to be a discrepancy with the problem setup. 

Based on the provided choices and the logic applied, if I were to select one of these options, I would choose the closest match which would be:
