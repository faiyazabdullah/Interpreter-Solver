QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Identify Key Elements**: The image shows two parallel lines AD and BC intersected by line EF at point E. Point A is marked below the intersection point of EF. The predicate states that angle A measures x degrees.

2. **Understand Relationships**:
   - Points D, E, and F lie on the same horizontal line.
   - The predicate indicates that point E lies on line CD.
   - The predicate also states that line AE is perpendicular to line EC.

3. **Deduce Systematically**:
   - Since line AE is perpendicular to line EC, the angle between these two lines is 90 degrees.
   - Given that points D, E, and F are collinear, we can deduce that angle A is vertically opposite to the right angle formed by AE and EC.

4. **Combine Multiple Predicates**:
   - From the fact that AE is perpendicular to EC, we know that angle AEC = 90 degrees.
   - Therefore, angle A equals angle AEC because they are vertical angles and supplementary to each other in this context.

5. **Conclude**:
   - Since angle A equals angle AEC, which is 90 degrees, we conclude that angle A = 90 degrees.

Thus, the measure of angle A is 90 degrees.
