QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
First, let's analyze the given information:

1. The length of line segment \( \text{AE} \) is 15 units.
2. Points \( \text{F}, \text{C}, \text{G} \) lie on the line \( \text{AE} \).
3. Circles centered at \( \text{C} \) with radii 2 and 3 are drawn around points \( \text{F}, \text{G} \) respectively.

We need to find the area of the shaded region. To do this, we will break it down into smaller parts and calculate their areas.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the area of the semicircle centered at \( \text{C} \) with radius 3:**
   - Radius = 3
   - Area of semicircle = \( \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (3)^2 = \frac{9\pi}{2} \)

2. **Calculate the area of the semicircle centered at \( \text{C} \) with radius 2:**
   - Radius = 2
   - Area of semicircle = \( \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (2)^2 = 2\pi \)

3. **Calculate the area of the rectangle formed by segments \( \text{AF}, \text{FG}, \text{GC} \):**
   - Length of \( \text{AF} \) is \( 3 \) (since \( \text{F} \) lies between \( \text{A} \) and \( \text{C} \))
   - Length of \( \text{FG} \) is \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) (since \( \text{F} \) lies between \( \text{C} \) and \( \text{G} \))
   - Length of \( \text{GC} \) is \( 3 - 2 = 1 \) (since \( \text{G} \) lies between \( \text{C} \) and \( \text{E} \))

   Area of rectangle = \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \)

4. **Calculate the area of the triangle formed by segments \( \text{AC}, \text{CG}, \text{FG} \):**
   - Base = \( \sqrt{(3)^2 + (1)^2} = \sqrt{10} \)
   - Height = \( 2 \)

   Area of triangle = \( \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times \sqrt{10} \times 2 = \sqrt{10} \approx 3.16 \)

5. **Calculate the area of the sector of circle centered at \( \text{C} \) with radius 3 and central angle \( 2\pi \):**
   - Central angle = \( 2\pi \) (full circle)
   - Area of sector = \( \pi \times 3^2 = 9\pi \)

6. **Calculate the area of the sector of circle centered at \( \text{C} \) with radius 2 and central angle \( \pi \):**
   - Central angle = \( \pi \) (half circle)
   - Area of sector = \( \frac{1}{2} \pi (2)^2 = 2\pi \)

7. **Subtract the areas of the triangles and sectors from the semicircles and the rectangle:**

   Total shaded area = Area of semicircle - Area of semicircle + Area of rectangle - Area of triangle - Area of sector of circle centered at \( \text{C} \) with radius 3 + Area of sector of circle centered at \( \text{C} \) with radius 2

   Total shaded area ≈ \( \frac{9\pi}{2} + 2\pi - 6 - \sqrt{10} - 9\pi + 2\pi \)

   Simplifying, total shaded area ≈ \( \frac{9\pi}{2} + 4\pi - 9\pi - \sqrt{10} - 6 \)

   Final calculation yields approximately \( 58.9 \)

Therefore, the final answer is:

Final Answer: B
