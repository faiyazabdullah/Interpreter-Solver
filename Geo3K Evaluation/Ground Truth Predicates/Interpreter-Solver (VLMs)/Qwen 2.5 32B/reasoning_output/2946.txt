**Solution Process:**

Given that FGHJ is a kite, we know that opposite sides are equal and adjacent sides are perpendicular. We are given several conditions related to the angles and lengths of the sides.

Let's start by noting that since FGHJ is a kite, it means FG = HG = FJ = HJ. Also, angle FGH = angle HGF = 128° (from the predicate).

Now, let's deduce the angles in the kite:

1. Since FGHJ is a kite, the sum of the interior angles around a kite is always 360°. Thus, angle FGH + angle GHJ = 360° - angle FGH - angle HGF = 360° - 128° - 128° = 96°.

2. Given that angle FHJ = 72°, this implies angle GHJ = 96° - 72° = 24° because the total internal angles of the kite must sum to 360°.

Since GH = FG and the kite is symmetrical along the axis bisecting GH and FG, angle FGJ = angle GHJ = 24°.

Finally, considering angle FGJ = 24° and angle FHJ = 72°, the measure of angle GFGJ (which includes angle GFG and angle FGJ) can be calculated as follows:

∠GFGJ = 180° - (∠FHJ + ∠GHJ)

Substituting the values,

∠GFGJ = 180° - (72° + 24°) = 180° - 96° = 84°

However, this doesn't match our options which suggest different measures. Let's re-examine our logic. Considering the symmetry and the properties of a kite where opposite angles are equal and adjacent angles are supplementary.

Therefore, angle GFG = 180° - angle FHJ = 180° - 72° = 108°.

This seems contradictory based on the provided options. Let's reassess using another angle relationship.

We know that angle GFGJ (which includes angle GFG and angle FGJ) should consider the supplementary property where the sum of adjacent angles equals 180°.

Thus, angle GFGJ = 180° - 128° = 52°.

Considering the options, the closest value fitting within the context of a kite geometry is likely 72° based on the supplementary property and symmetry considerations.
