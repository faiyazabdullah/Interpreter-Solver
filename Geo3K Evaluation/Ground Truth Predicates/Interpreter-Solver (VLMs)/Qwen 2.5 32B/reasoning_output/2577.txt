====================================================================================================
To find the value of \(x\) in the given geometric figure, we need to analyze the relationships between the points and lines provided by the predicates.

Given:
1. \( \text{Length}(PT) = 13.5 \)
2. \( \text{Length}(WR) = 3 \)
3. \( \text{Length}(PS) = x \)
4. \( \text{Length}(WQ) = 9 \)
5. \( \text{Point}(P, SR) \)
6. \( \text{Point}(Q, UV) \)
7. \( \text{Angle}(ST, RS) = \text{Angle}(UVW) \)
8. \( \text{Angle}(RS, ST) = \text{Angle}(VUW) \)
9. \( \text{Length}(QU) = \text{Length}(QC) \)
10. \( \text{Length}(SP) = \text{Length}(PR) \)

Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Analyze the Geometry
We have two triangles \( \triangle PSR \) and \( \triangle WQR \) which share the same height relative to their bases \( PR \) and \( QR \), respectively. 

Given that \( \text{Length}(WQ) = 9 \) and considering that \( \text{Length}(WQ) \) and \( \text{Length}(WR) \) form the base of the triangle \( \triangle WQR \), let's denote the height from \( Q \) to \( WQ \) as \( h_1 \). This height \( h_1 \) corresponds to the height \( h_2 \) from \( P \) to \( PR \).

Since \( \text{Length}(WR) = 3 \), we can infer that the height from \( W \) to \( WR \) is \( h_2 \).

### Step 2: Apply the Similarity Principle
Since \( \text{Length}(WQ) = 9 \) and \( \text{Length}(WR) = 3 \), the ratio of the heights will be the same because the triangles are similar by the similarity of right triangles sharing the same angle measures.

Thus,
\[ \frac{h_1}{h_2} = \frac{9}{3} = 3 \]

### Step 3: Use Given Lengths
From the problem statement, we know:
\[ \text{Length}(PT) = 13.5 \]
and
\[ \text{Length}(WQ) = 9 \]

Given that \( \text{Length}(PR) = \text{Length}(SP) \), we conclude:
\[ \text{Length}(PR) = \frac{\text{Length}(PT)}{2} = \frac{13.5}{2} = 6.75 \]

### Step 4: Calculate \( x \)
Using the similarity ratio \( \frac{h_1}{h_2} = 3 \), and knowing \( h_2 = 3 \):
\[ h_1 = 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

Therefore, \( x \) (the length of \( PS \)) is equal to \( h_1 \):
\[ x = 9 \]

### Conclusion:
The final answer is \( x = 9 \).
