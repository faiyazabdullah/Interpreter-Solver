QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Let's analyze the given triangle \( \triangle GHJ \) and the point \( D \) which lies on \( \overline{GH} \) such that \( GD = 2x - 2 \). We know the lengths of some sides:

- \( GH = 7 \)
- \( HJ = 10 \)

We also know that \( \angle GDH = \angle DHJ \).

To find \( GD \), let's denote \( GD = x \). Therefore, \( GD = 2x - 2 \) implies \( x = 2x - 2 \).

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = 2x - 2 \]
\[ x - 2x = -2 \]
\[ -x = -2 \]
\[ x = 2 \]

So, \( GD = 2x - 2 = 2(2) - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2 \times 2 = 4 \).

However, this seems incorrect based on the problem setup. Let's re-evaluate the constraints and relationships:

Since \( GD = 2x - 2 \) and we need to find \( GD \), we should check if there was a misinterpretation. Given \( GH = 7 \) and \( HJ = 10 \), it seems we need to solve for \( GD \) using the correct relationships.

Let's consider the correct interpretation:

Given \( GH = 7 \) and \( HJ = 10 \), and knowing \( GD = 2x - 2 \), we need to find the correct value of \( x \):

\[ x = 2x - 2 \]
\[ x = 2(2) - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2 \]

This interpretation is consistent with the problem setup. However, since the problem involves finding \( GD \), and given the options, we need to choose the closest value.

Given the options provided, the correct value for \( GD \) should be:

\[ GD = 6 \]

Therefore, the correct choice is:

Final Answer: B
