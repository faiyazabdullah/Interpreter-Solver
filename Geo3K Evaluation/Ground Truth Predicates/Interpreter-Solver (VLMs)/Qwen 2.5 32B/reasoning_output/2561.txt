====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to find the area of the given figure. Let's analyze the figure step by step.

1. **Identify Key Elements:**
   - The figure consists of two right triangles and a rectangle.
   - Triangles ABC and BCD are right triangles with AB = 5 m, BC = 4 m, and BD = 4 m.
   - Triangle ADE is a right triangle with AD = 5 m and DE = 6 m.
   - Perpendicular lines are shown between points D, E, A, and B, which means DE is parallel to AC and AE is parallel to BD.

2. **Calculate the Area of Triangle ABC:**
   - Using the formula for the area of a right triangle: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]
   - Here, the base is AC (which is equal to AD because they are opposite sides of the rectangle) and the height is BC.
     \[
     \text{Area}_{\triangle ABC} = \frac{1}{2} \times 5 \times 4 = 10 \text{ square meters}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Length of AC:**
   - Since AC is the hypotenuse of triangle ABC and it forms a right angle with AB and BC, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
     \[
     AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2
     \]
     \[
     AC^2 = 5^2 + 4^2 = 25 + 16 = 41
     \]
     \[
     AC = \sqrt{41}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Area of Rectangle ADE:**
   - The length of ADE is DE = 6 m and the width is AD = 5 m.
     \[
     \text{Area}_{\text{rectangle}} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ square meters}
     \]

5. **Total Area Calculation:**
   - The total area of the figure is the sum of the areas of the two right triangles and the rectangle.
     \[
     \text{Total Area} = \text{Area}_{\triangle ABC} + \text{Area}_{\triangle BCD} + \text{Area}_{\text{rectangle}}
     \]
   - We already calculated the area of \(\triangle ABC\).
   - For \(\triangle BCD\):
     \[
     \text{Area}_{\triangle BCD} = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times CD
     \]
     Since \(CD\) is the same as \(AC\):
     \[
     \text{Area}_{\triangle BCD} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \times \sqrt{41} \approx \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \times 6.403 = 12.806 \text{ square meters}
     \]
   - Adding these together:
     \[
     \text{Total Area} \approx 10 + 12.806 + 30 = 52.806 \text{ square meters}
     \]

6. **Final Answer:**
   - Rounding to the nearest tenth:
     \[
     \text{Total Area} \approx 52.8 \text{ square meters}
     \]

Given the options provided, none of them match this result exactly. However, the closest value is 52.8 square meters rounded to the nearest tenth, which corresponds to option D.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Final Answer: D
