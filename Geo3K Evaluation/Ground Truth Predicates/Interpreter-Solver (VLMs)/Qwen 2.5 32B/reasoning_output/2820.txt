**Analysis:**

Given the problem, we need to find the area of the circle where point \( A \) lies at distance 4 inches from the center \( O \), and point \( B \) lies on the circumference of the circle. Since \( O \) is the center and the length of segment \( AB \) is 4 inches, we can infer that \( A \) is 4 inches from the center along the radius.

Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \( AOB \):

\[ AB^2 = AO^2 + OB^2 \]

Since \( AB = 4 \) and \( AO = OB = r \), where \( r \) is the radius of the circle:

\[ 4^2 = r^2 + r^2 \]
\[ 16 = 2r^2 \]
\[ r^2 = 8 \]
\[ r = \sqrt{8} \approx 2.83 \text{ inches} \]

However, since the question specifies rounding to the nearest tenth, we use \( r \approx 2.9 \) inches.

To find the area of the circle:

\[ \text{Area} = \pi r^2 \]
\[ \text{Area} = \pi (2.9)^2 \]
\[ \text{Area} ≈ 3.14 \times 8.41 \]
\[ \text{Area} ≈ 26.00 \]

Rounding to the nearest tenth:

\[ \text{Area} ≈ 26.0 \]

Thus, the closest choice is:

**Final Answer: C**
