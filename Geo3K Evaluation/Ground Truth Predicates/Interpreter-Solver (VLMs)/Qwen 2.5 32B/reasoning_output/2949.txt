====================================================================================================
To find the area of the given figure, we can break it down into two simpler shapes: a rectangle and a right triangle. 

First, let's identify the dimensions of these shapes:
- The length of the rectangle (AB) is 11 km.
- The height of the rectangle (BH) is 10 km.
- The width of the rectangle (BC) is the base of the right triangle.

Since AB is the same as BC in this configuration, BC = 11 km - 8 km = 3 km (as CD = 8 km).

Now, we have a rectangle with width 3 km and height 10 km, and a right triangle with base 8 km and height 10 km.

Let's calculate the area of the rectangle:
Area_rectangle = Length * Width
= 11 km * 10 km
= 110 km²

Next, calculate the area of the right triangle:
Area_triangle = (1/2) * Base * Height
= (1/2) * 8 km * 10 km
= 40 km²

Finally, add the areas together to get the total area:
Total_area = Area_rectangle + Area_triangle
= 110 km² + 40 km²
= 150 km²

Rounding to the nearest tenth gives us 150.0 km².

Therefore, the correct answer is:
