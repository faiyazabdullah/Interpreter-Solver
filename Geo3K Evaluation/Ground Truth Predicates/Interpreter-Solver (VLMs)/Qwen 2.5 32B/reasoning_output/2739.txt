**ANALYSIS:**
To find the area of the parallelogram \(ABCD\), we need to calculate the height of the parallelogram using the given information about its sides and one of its heights.

Given:
- Length of \(AB\) = 21 cm
- Length of \(AC\) = 17 cm
- Length of \(EC\) = 8 cm
- Point \(E\) lies on \(CD\) such that \(\angle AEC\) is perpendicular.

We can use the fact that the area of a parallelogram can be calculated as base times height. Here, the base is \(AB = 21\) cm and the height is \(AE\).

Since \(AC\) is the diagonal and \(EC\) is part of \(AC\), we can find \(AE\) by considering the right triangle \(AEC\). However, we need to find the length of \(AE\) first. 

Using the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle AEC\):
\[ AE^2 = AC^2 - EC^2 \]
\[ AE^2 = 17^2 - 8^2 \]
\[ AE^2 = 289 - 64 \]
\[ AE^2 = 225 \]
\[ AE = \sqrt{225} = 15 \text{ cm} \]

Now, the area of the parallelogram is:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{base} \times \text{height} = AB \times AE = 21 \times 15 = 315 \text{ cm}^2 \]

Thus, the area of the parallelogram is 315 square centimeters.
