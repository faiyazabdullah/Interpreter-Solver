To find the area of the parallelogram, we need to calculate the base and the height first. From the given information, the length of segment AC is 3.2 meters, which means the base of the parallelogram is 3.2 meters. 

We can use the fact that AD = BC because they are opposite sides of the parallelogram and they are equal by the properties of parallelograms. Since AB = CD, it implies that the parallelogram has two pairs of equal sides, making it a rhombus. Therefore, diagonals BD and AC intersect at right angles and bisect each other. Thus, each half of diagonal AC is 1.6 meters long.

Given that the height is the same as the length of half diagonal BD, let's denote half of diagonal BD as h. We have:

1. AC = 3.2
2. AD = BC = AB = CD
3. Half of diagonal BD = h

Let's denote half of diagonal BD as h. Using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by half diagonals BD and AC:

\[ \sqrt{(AB)^2 - (h)^2} = 1.6 \]

Since AB is equal to CD and AD is equal to BC, we know that:

\[ \text{Length of AB} = \sqrt{1.6^2 + h^2} = \text{length of AC} = 3.2 \]

Now, we can solve this equation for h:

\[ \sqrt{2.56 + h^2} = 3.2 \]
\[ 2.56 + h^2 = 10.24 \]
\[ h^2 = 7.68 \]
\[ h = \sqrt{7.68} \approx 2.77 \]

So, the height of the parallelogram is approximately 2.77 meters.

Now, we can calculate the area of the parallelogram using the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{base} \times \text{height} \]
\[ \text{Area} = 3.2 \times 2.77 \approx 8.8 \]

Rounded to the nearest tenth, the area is 8.8 square meters.

Therefore, the answer is:
