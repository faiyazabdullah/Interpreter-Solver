====================================================================================================
Given the problem, we need to find the length of segment \( WP \) in the kite \( WXZY \).

First, let's summarize the given information:

1. \( WX = 6 \)
2. \( XP = 4 \)
3. \( P \) lies on \( ZX \)
4. \( P \) lies on \( WY \)

Since \( WXZY \) is a kite, it has two pairs of equal sides, and its diagonals are perpendicular to each other. We can use these properties to solve for \( WP \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the right triangle \( XWP \)**:
   Since \( WX = 6 \) and \( XP = 4 \), we have a right triangle \( XWP \) where \( WP \) is one of the legs and \( XP \) is the other leg.

2. **Use the Pythagorean theorem**:
   In right triangle \( XWP \), the hypotenuse \( WX = 6 \). Let \( WP = x \).
   \[
   WX^2 = XP^2 + WP^2
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   6^2 = 4^2 + x^2
   \]
   \[
   36 = 16 + x^2
   \]
   \[
   x^2 = 20
   \]
   \[
   x = \sqrt{20}
   \]

Therefore, \( WP = \sqrt{20} \).
