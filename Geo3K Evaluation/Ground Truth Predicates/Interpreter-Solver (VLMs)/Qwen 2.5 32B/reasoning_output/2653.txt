**BEGIN ANALYSIS AND SOLUTION**

**1. ANALYZE & EXTRACT**
- From the problem, we have a rectangle WXZY with the following properties:
  - WX = 7, XY = 6, WZ = 8, and XZ = 12.
  - Angle 1 = 30 degrees.
  - Angles labeled with letters are measures of angles at points W, X, Y, Z respectively.
  - Perpendicular lines YW and YZ.

**2. DEDUCE SYSTEMATICALLY**

**Step 1:** Since WXZY is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and adjacent sides form right angles. Therefore:
\[ WX = WZ = 7 \]
\[ XY = YZ = 6 \]

**Step 2:** We know angle 1 = 30 degrees. Since WXZY is a rectangle, it forms four right angles at each corner except one where angle 1 is located.

**Step 3:** Since WXZY is a rectangle, the sum of the interior angles equals 360 degrees. Therefore:
\[ \text{Angle W} + \text{Angle X} + \text{Angle Y} + \text{Angle Z} = 360^\circ \]

**Step 4:** Since WXZY is a rectangle, \(\text{Angle W} = 90^\circ\) and \(\text{Angle Z} = 90^\circ\).

**Step 5:** Let's calculate the other two angles:
\[ \text{Angle X} + \text{Angle Y} = 360^\circ - 90^\circ - 90^\circ = 180^\circ \]

Given that \(\text{Angle X} = \text{Angle W}\) and \(\text{Angle Y} = \text{Angle Z}\), we know:
\[ \text{Angle X} = \text{Angle W} = 90^\circ \]
\[ \text{Angle Y} = \text{Angle Z} = 90^\circ \]

Since \(\text{Angle W}\) is formed by the intersection of lines WX and YZ and it's given as 90 degrees, but here it's labeled as \(\text{Angle 6}\) which should be 60 degrees because \(\text{Angle 6}\) is formed by the intersection of lines WX and YZ forming a 60 degree angle due to the right angles at W and Z.

**Step 6:** Verify using the fact that \(\text{Angle X}\) and \(\text{Angle Y}\) are each 90 degrees and sum up to 180 degrees, making \(\text{Angle 6}\) part of the angle between WX and YZ which is 60 degrees.

**CONCLUSION:** \(\text{Angle 6}\) = 60 degrees.

**FINAL ANSWER:**
