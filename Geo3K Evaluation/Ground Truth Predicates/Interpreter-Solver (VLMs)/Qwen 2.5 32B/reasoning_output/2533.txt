====================================================================================================
To find \( JQ \), we need to analyze the given information and use geometric properties.

Given:
1. \( PQ \perp PN \)
2. \( QM \perp ML \)
3. \( QK \perp KL \)
4. \( JQ \) is the incenter of \( \triangle JLN \)

Since \( Q \) is the incenter of \( \triangle JLN \), it means \( Q \) is equidistant from the sides of \( \triangle JLN \).

Let's denote the lengths as follows:
- \( PQ = 16.5 \)
- \( QM = 9 \)

We need to find \( JQ \). Since \( Q \) is the incenter, \( Q \) is equidistant from \( LN \), \( NJ \), and \( JL \).

Using the fact that \( Q \) is the incenter, we can use the formula for the distance from the incenter to the sides of the triangle, which is the same for all three sides. Therefore, we have:

\[ JQ = \frac{a}{r} = \frac{b}{r} = \frac{c}{r} \]

where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are the sides of the triangle and \( r \) is the radius of the inscribed circle.

However, since \( Q \) is the incenter, we can use the property that the sum of the distances from the incenter to the sides of the triangle is equal to the perimeter of the triangle divided by twice the semiperimeter.

But instead, we can directly use the fact that the incenter divides the angle bisectors into segments such that the ratio of the segments is equal to the ratio of the other two sides of the triangle.

Since \( Q \) is the incenter, we can use the fact that the distance from the incenter to the sides of the triangle is the same. Therefore, we can use the fact that the distance from the incenter to the sides of the triangle is the same for all three sides.

So, we have:

\[ JQ = \sqrt{\frac{PQ^2 + QM^2}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{16.5^2 + 9^2}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{272.25 + 81}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{353.25}{2}} = \sqrt{176.625} \approx 13.29 \]

Rounding to the nearest hundredth, we get:

\[ JQ \approx 16.50 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
