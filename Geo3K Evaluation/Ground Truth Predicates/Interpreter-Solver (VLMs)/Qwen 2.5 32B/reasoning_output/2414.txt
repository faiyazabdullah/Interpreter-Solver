====================================================================================================
Let's begin our systematic deduction.

**Step 1:** Given that AB = 12, AC = 16, and ED = 5, we need to find AE. 

**Step 2:** Since AB = 12 and AC = 16, triangle ABC has sides AB and AC with lengths 12 and 16 respectively. This implies that angle ACB is less than 90 degrees because AC is longer than AB. 

**Step 3:** Since CD is parallel to BE, and given that AD is connected to C and E is connected to D, triangle ADE is similar to triangle ABE by AA similarity criterion (Angle-Angle). 

**Step 4:** From the similarity of triangles ADE and ABE, we get the ratio of their corresponding sides as:

\[ \frac{AD}{AE} = \frac{AB}{AC} \]

Given that AC = 16 and AB = 12, substituting these values gives us:

\[ \frac{AD}{AE} = \frac{12}{16} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Since AD = AC - CD = 16 - 5 = 11, substituting this value into the equation gives:

\[ \frac{11}{AE} = \frac{3}{4} \]

**Step 5:** Solving for AE, we get:

\[ AE = \frac{11 \times 4}{3} = \frac{44}{3} \approx 14.67 \]

Given the options, the closest value is 15.
