**ANALYSIS:**
Given that AB is a diameter of the circle, AC = 8 inches, and BC = 15 inches, we need to find the radius of the circle.

**DEDUCTION:**
From the given information, we have:
- AB is a diameter of the circle.
- AC = 8 inches.
- BC = 15 inches.

Using the fact that AC is one half of AB (since AC is a chord perpendicular to the diameter AB), and considering that AC is a segment from a point outside the circle to a point on the circle, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle ABC.

In triangle ABC:
AC² + BC² = AB²

We know AC = 8 and BC = 15, so:
8² + 15² = AB²
64 + 225 = AB²
289 = AB²
AB = √289
AB = 17 inches

Since AB is the diameter, its length is twice the radius, so:
Radius = AB / 2
Radius = 17 / 2
Radius = 8.5 inches

Therefore, the radius of the circle is 8.5 inches.

**CONCLUSION:**
The radius of the circle is 8.5 inches.
