To find the area of the triangle, we need to determine its height using the given information about the base and the length of the altitude from point A to the base BC.

Given:
- Length of segment AB = 10.2 ft
- Length of segment AC = 7 ft
- Perpendicular from A to BC = 7 ft

Since the problem involves a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to verify this:

Let's assume the height AD splits triangle ABC into two right triangles, ADH and AHD, where H is the foot of the perpendicular from A to BC. Since AD is the height and ADH is a right triangle, we know:

\[AD^2 + DH^2 = AH^2\]
\[7^2 + DH^2 = 7^2\]

This equation shows that the height AD is indeed the same as the length given, confirming it's a right triangle.

Now, to find the area of the triangle:

Area of a triangle is given by \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\).

Here, the base is BC (which is given as 10.2 ft) and the height is AD (which is also given as 7 ft):

So,

Area = \(\frac{1}{2} \times 10.2 \times 7 = 35.7\) square feet
