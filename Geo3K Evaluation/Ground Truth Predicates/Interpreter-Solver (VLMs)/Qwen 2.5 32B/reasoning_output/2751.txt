QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**Analysis:**

Given the geometric configuration with points \(W, X, Y, Z, G, H, I, J\) and the provided measures of angles:

1. **Angle Measures:**
   - \(m\angle WXJ = 130^\circ\)
   - \(m\angle WZG = 20^\circ\)
   - \(m\angle YIZ = 20^\circ\)

2. **Line Ratios:**
   - \(\frac{IJ}{XJ} = \frac{HJ}{YJ}\)

To find \(m\angle YIz\):

First, we need to understand the relationship between the given angles and how they relate to the triangle \(WXY\). Given \(m\angle WXJ = 130^\circ\), this implies that \(WX\) and \(XJ\) are forming a straight line, thus \(W, X, J\) being collinear with \(J\) further from \(X\).

Now considering the ratio equality:

\[
\frac{IJ}{XJ} = \frac{HJ}{YJ}
\]

Since \(H\) lies on \(GJ\) and \(I\) lies on \(GJ\), this implies \(HJ\) and \(YJ\) are corresponding sides in two similar triangles formed by \(IJ\) and \(XJ\), respectively.

Next, let's consider the angles around point \(Y\). Since \(m\angle WZG = 20^\circ\) and \(m\angle YIZ = 20^\circ\), and knowing \(m\angle WXJ = 130^\circ\), the remaining angle at \(Y\) should be calculated using the properties of supplementary angles in triangles and the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\).

Let's calculate:

Since \(W, X, J\) are collinear and \(m\angle WXJ = 130^\circ\), the supplementary angle at \(J\) would be \(50^\circ\) because \(180^\circ - 130^\circ = 50^\circ\).

Now, since \(m\angle WZG = 20^\circ\) and itâ€™s given that \(m\angle YIZ = 20^\circ\), the total angle at \(Y\) needs to be calculated considering these angles around \(Y\).

Considering the straight line and supplementary angles, the remaining angle \(m\angle YIZ\) can be derived as follows:

\[m\angle YIZ = 180^\circ - (50^\circ + 20^\circ)\]
\[= 180^\circ - 70^\circ\]
\[= 110^\circ\]

Therefore, the measure of \(m\angle YIZ\) is \(110^\circ\).
