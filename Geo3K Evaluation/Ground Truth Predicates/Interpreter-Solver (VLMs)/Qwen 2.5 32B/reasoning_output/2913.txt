QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we will use the given information and apply geometric principles. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Identify Key Elements:**
   - Points A, B, C, and D form a quadrilateral.
   - The length of AB = 14.
   - The length of BC = 10.
   - The length of BD = 14.
   - Line DC is perpendicular to line BC.

2. **Deduce Systematically:**
   Since AB = BD = 14 and BC = 10, triangle ABD is isosceles with AB = BD. This implies that angle ADB = angle DBA.
   Let's denote the length of AC as \( x \).

3. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   Since AC is the hypotenuse of right triangle BCD and CD is perpendicular to BC, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle BCD.
   The length of CD can be found using the fact that CD is the height from D to BC, which splits the rectangle formed by the intersection of the perpendiculars into two right triangles.
   
   Let's denote the length of CD as \( h \). Then, we have:
   \[
   AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot BC \cdot \cos(\angle ABC)
   \]
   However, since CD is the height and BD = 14, we can directly use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle BCD:
   \[
   AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot BC \cdot \cos(\angle ABC)
   \]
   But since AB = BD = 14 and BC = 10, and CD is the height, we can use:
   \[
   AC^2 = 14^2 - 10^2 = 196 - 100 = 96
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   AC = \sqrt{96} = 4\sqrt{6}
   \]

So, the length of x (AC) is \( 4\sqrt{6} \).
