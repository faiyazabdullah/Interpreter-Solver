QUESTION:
A plane travels from Des Moines to Phoenix, on to Atlanta, and back to Des Moines, as shown below. Find the distance in miles from Phoenix to Atlanta if the total trip was 3482 miles.

CHOICES:
A. 53
B. 73.8
C. 110
D. 1591

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**BEGIN ANALYSIS:**

From the given information and the predicates:

1. Length of Line AC = 73.8x
2. Length of Line AB = 150x + 91
3. Length of Line BC = 110x + 53

We need to find the length of Line AD, which represents the distance from Phoenix to Atlanta, in miles.

Since the perimeter of the triangle ABC is equal to 3482 miles, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Length of AC} + \text{Length of AB} + \text{Length of BC} = 3482 \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ 73.8x + (150x + 91) + (110x + 53) = 3482 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ 73.8x + 150x + 91 + 110x + 53 = 3482 \]
\[ 333.8x + 144 = 3482 \]

Subtracting 144 from both sides:

\[ 333.8x = 3338 \]

Dividing by 333.8:

\[ x = 10 \]

Now, substituting \( x = 10 \) into the expression for the length of Line AD (which represents the distance from Phoenix to Atlanta):

\[ \text{Length of AD} = 150x + 91 \]
\[ \text{Length of AD} = 150(10) + 91 \]
\[ \text{Length of AD} = 1500 + 91 \]
\[ \text{Length of AD} = 1591 \]

Therefore, the distance from Phoenix to Atlanta is 1591 miles.

**FINAL ANSWER:**
