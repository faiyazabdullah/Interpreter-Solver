QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, let's break it down into several parts:

1. **Identify Key Elements:** We need to understand the given information about the triangle \(ABC\) and the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).

2. **Analyze the Geometry:** From the image, we know:
   - \(\angle ADB = 45^\circ\)
   - \(AB = y\)
   - \(CD = x\)
   - \(AC = 5\)
   - \(BD\) is vertical (so \(BD\) is perpendicular to \(DC\))
   - \(AD\) is perpendicular to \(BC\)

3. **Determine Relationships Using Trigonometry:** Since \(\angle ADB = 45^\circ\), and knowing that \(\sin 45^\circ = \cos 45^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\), we can infer certain relationships between the sides of the triangle.

4. **Apply Theorems and Theorems:** We need to use properties related to right triangles and trigonometric identities.

5. **Calculate Specific Lengths:** Once we have the relationships, we can calculate specific lengths based on the given information.

Let's start with the relationships:

Since \(\angle ADB = 45^\circ\), and using the fact that \(\sin 45^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\):

\[
\sin 45^\circ = \frac{y}{AD} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

This gives us:

\[
y = AD \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

Using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle \(ABD\):

\[
AB^2 + BD^2 = AD^2
\]

Since \(BD\) is vertical, \(BD = CD = x\). Thus:

\[
y^2 + x^2 = AD^2
\]

Now, using the fact that \(AC = 5\) and applying the Law of Cosines in triangle \(ABC\):

\[
AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot BC \cdot \cos(45^\circ)
\]

Since \(BC = x\):

\[
5^2 = y^2 + x^2 - 2 \cdot y \cdot x \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

\[
25 = y^2 + x^2 - \sqrt{2}xy
\]

Now, we need to find \(y\) such that the above equation holds true.

By substituting \(AD = \frac{y}{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} = \sqrt{2}y\), we get:

\[
x^2 + (\sqrt{2}y)^2 = 25
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 + 2y^2 = 25
\]

Now, substitute back to find \(y\):

\[
y = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2y^2 - x^2}
\]

Given the options provided, we need to check which one fits this relationship. 

After checking the values:

The final calculation shows \(y = 5\sqrt{2}\).

Therefore, the answer is:
