QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Given Information:**
   - \( AE = m - 2 \)
   - \( EC = m + 4 \)
   - \( AD = 4 \)
   - \( AB = 20 \)
   - \( D \) lies on \( BA \)
   - \( E \) lies on \( AC \)
   - \( BC \parallel DE \)

2. **Step-by-step Deduction:**
   
   Since \( D \) lies on \( BA \), we can denote \( BD = x \) and \( DA = 4 \). Therefore, \( AB = AD + BD = 4 + x = 20 \) which implies \( x = 16 \).

   Now, since \( E \) lies on \( AC \) and \( D \) lies on \( BA \), we need to find the length of \( EC \). Given that \( BC \parallel DE \), triangles \( BDC \) and \( EDC \) are similar by AA similarity criterion.

   Let's denote \( EC = y \). From the similarity, we have:
   \[
   \frac{DE}{BC} = \frac{EC}{EC}
   \]
   However, directly calculating the length of \( EC \) using similar triangles isn't straightforward without knowing \( BC \). Instead, we use the fact that \( E \) lies on \( AC \) and \( D \) lies on \( BA \).

   Since \( E \) is on \( AC \), and we know \( AC = AE + EC = m - 2 + y \). But we don't have enough information about \( y \) yet.

3. **Finding \( m \):**
   We need to express \( m \) in terms of known quantities. Using the fact that \( AE = m - 2 \) and \( EC = m + 4 \), and considering the parallel lines and the properties of similar triangles, we can conclude that:
   \[
   m = 10
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
Final Answer: B
