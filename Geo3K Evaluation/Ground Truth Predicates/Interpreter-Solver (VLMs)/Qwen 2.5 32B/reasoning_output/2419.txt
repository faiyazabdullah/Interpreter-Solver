**ANALYSIS:**
We have a circle with a chord AB = 6 inches and a chord CF = 8 inches. We need to find the circumference of the circle.

Firstly, since the rectangle is inscribed in the circle, the diagonal of the rectangle is the diameter of the circle. Let's denote the center of the circle as E. Therefore, AE = CE = 4 inches (since they are radii).

Now, we know that:
1. Point C lies on the circle.
2. Point A lies on the circle.
3. Point F lies on the circle.

Since C is at a distance of 8 inches from A, and this distance forms a part of the chord of the circle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle AEC to find the length of AC.

Let's calculate AC:

AC = âˆš(AE^2 + CE^2)

However, we don't actually need this calculation to find the circumference directly. Instead, we can use the fact that the total perimeter of the rectangle would be equal to the circumference of the circle when considering the rectangle as a whole shape.

Since the rectangle is inscribed in the circle, the diagonal of the rectangle will be the diameter of the circle. Hence, if we consider the entire rectangle, its perimeter will be the same as the circumference of the circle.

Given the lengths of the sides of the rectangle (which form the chords of the circle):

AB = 6 inches (length of one side)
CF = 8 inches (length of the other side)

The total perimeter of the rectangle will be:

Perimeter = AB + BC + CA + AF

However, since the rectangle is inscribed in the circle, and considering it as a whole, the perimeter is equal to the circumference of the circle. 

So, the circumference of the circle = Perimeter of the rectangle

To find the circumference, we need to consider the lengths of the chords which together make up the perimeter of the rectangle.

Therefore, Circumference of the circle = Length of AB + Length of CF
