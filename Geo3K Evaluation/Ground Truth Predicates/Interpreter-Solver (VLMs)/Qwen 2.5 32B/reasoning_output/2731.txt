QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Let's begin the analysis:

### Step 1: Analyze and Extract Key Elements
From the image and given predicates:
- The lengths of sides \(DE\) = 5 cm, \(AC\) = 12 cm, \(CB\) = 13 cm.
- Point \(E\) lies on line segment \(CA\).
- Perpendicular from point \(D\) to line segment \(CE\).

### Step 2: Deduce Systematically
Given that \(DE\) is perpendicular to \(CE\) and considering \(DE = 5\) cm:
- \(DE\) forms a right angle with \(EC\), thus triangle \(DEC\) is a right triangle.

Using Pythagoras' theorem in triangle \(DEC\):
\[ DC^2 = DE^2 + EC^2 \]

Since \(EC = CA - AE\), and \(AE\) is part of \(AC\), but we don't have specific lengths for \(AE\) directly from the problem, let's denote \(AE = x\). Therefore,
\[ DC = \sqrt{(5)^2 + (12 - x)^2} \]
We need to find the perimeter of the parallelogram, which requires finding the length of one side opposite \(DC\).

Since \(DC\) is a diagonal of the parallelogram, and \(DC\) splits the parallelogram into two congruent triangles, \(DC\) is equal to the opposite side of the parallelogram which is also the base of the parallelogram when extended.

### Step 3: Conclude and Select
To find the perimeter, we need the length of one side opposite \(DC\). Since \(DC\) is the diagonal and we know the sides adjacent to it, we can use the properties of parallelograms to deduce the length of the other sides.

By the properties of parallelograms, the opposite sides are equal. Let's assume \(DC = AD = 13\) cm (as \(AD\) and \(BC\) are the other sides opposite to \(DE\) and \(EC\)).

Therefore, the perimeter \(P\) of the parallelogram is:
\[ P = 2 \times (DC + AD) \]
\[ P = 2 \times (13 + 13) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 26 \]
\[ P = 52 \]

However, the options provided do not match this result. Let's re-evaluate with the assumption that the problem might be asking for the sum of the lengths of the diagonals which would give us the perimeter of the parallelogram.

Given the options, the closest match would be:
