Given the geometric configuration:

- **Triangle IWN** is equilateral.
- The length of **line segment WN** is 5.
- Points **W** and **N** lie on the circle centered at **I** with radius \( r_0 \).

Since **△ IWN** is equilateral, each side has the same length, and the angle at vertex **W** is \( \frac{\pi}{3} \). 

We need to find the measure of angle **WNW**, which corresponds to the central angle subtended by arc **WN**.

In an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle, the central angle is twice the inscribed angle. Therefore,

\[ \angle WNW = 2 \times \angle WNW = 2 \times \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{\pi}{3} \]

However, since we are looking for the angle at the center formed by the two radii connecting points **W** and **N** to the point **W** where the circle intersects, it's actually half of the central angle subtended by the arc **WN**.

So, the central angle subtended by arc **WN** is \( \frac{\pi}{3} \), and the angle **WNW** is half of this:

\[ \angle WNW = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{\pi}{3} = \frac{\pi}{6} \]

But we need the full measure around the circle, which is \( \pi \) radians. Hence, the angle **WNW** is \( \pi - \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{5\pi}{6} \).

This does not match any provided options. Let's recheck our logic:

1. **Triangle IWN** is equilateral, so each side is equal.
2. **WN = 5** indicates one side of the triangle.
3. Since **WN** is a side of the equilateral triangle, and the circle is such that the distances from the center to **W** and **N** are consistent with the radius being \( r_0 \).

Revisiting the options, let’s consider the implications correctly:

- Each part of the circumference divided into thirds gives us arcs of length \( \frac{5}{3} \) each, which corresponds to angles of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) each when considering the total circle as \( 2\pi \).

Thus, the angle **WNW** should indeed be \( \frac{2\pi}{3} \), but this matches none of the given options.

Given the constraints and logical deductions, the closest possible interpretation aligning with the options provided seems to be:
