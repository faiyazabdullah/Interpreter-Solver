To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the regular hexagon given that the length of one of its sides is 6 cm. We will use the formula for the area of a regular polygon:

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2 n \]

where \( s \) is the side length and \( n \) is the number of sides of the polygon. For a regular hexagon, \( n = 6 \).

Given:
- \( s = 6 \) cm
- \( n = 6 \)

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 6^2 \times 6 \]

First, calculate \( 6^2 \):

\[ 6^2 = 36 \]

Next, multiply by 6:

\[ 36 \times 6 = 216 \]

Then, multiply by \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \):

\[ \text{Area} = 216 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 108\sqrt{3} \]

Now, approximate \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \):

\[ \text{Area} \approx 108 \times 1.732 = 186.936 \]

Rounding to the nearest tenth:

\[ \text{Area} \approx 186.9 \]

However, since none of the given choices match this value exactly, let's re-evaluate our approach. Notice that the problem specifies a regular polygon figure but provides the length of one line segment (which appears to be a diagonal). This suggests a different approach might be needed.

Given the complexity of directly applying the formula due to the diagonal length provided, we may need to consider a different method such as breaking down the hexagon into triangles or using trigonometric identities. However, based on the information provided, it seems we should focus on the closest match to our calculated value.

Let's compare our result to the provided options:

A. 12.7
B. 25.5
C. 101.8
D. 203.6

Since our calculated value is approximately 186.9, which is far outside the range of the provided choices, it seems there might be an error in the problem setup or the given choices do not align with the solution we derived. 

However, if we were to select the closest choice based on our calculation, it would be:
