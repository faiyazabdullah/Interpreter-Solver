Let's begin our systematic deduction.

### Step 1: Analyze and Extract Key Elements

**Key Elements:**
1. Angle \( \angle ASB = 106^\circ \)
2. Angle \( \angle ARS = 71^\circ \)
3. Point \( A \) lies on lines \( QR \), \( RC \), and \( QC \).
4. Point \( Q \) lies on lines \( RC \) and \( QC \).
5. Points \( Q \), \( A \), and \( C \) lie on the circle centered at \( B \) with radius 5 units.
6. Points \( A \), \( R \), and \( S \) lie on the circle centered at \( B \) with radius 5 units.
7. Points \( S \) and \( T \) lie on the circle centered at \( B \) with radius 5 units.

### Step 2: Deduce Systematically

#### Finding \( \widehat{QTS} \):

1. **Angle Calculation:**
   - Since \( Q \) lies on the circle centered at \( B \) with radius 5 units, \( \angle QBA = 90^\circ \) because \( QB \) is a radius of the circle.
   - Similarly, \( \angle RBC = 90^\circ \).

2. **Using Given Angles:**
   - \( \angle ASB = 106^\circ \) implies \( \angle AQS = 180^\circ - 106^\circ = 74^\circ \) because \( Q \) and \( S \) are opposite points on the circle.
   - \( \angle ARS = 71^\circ \) implies \( \angle ARB = 90^\circ - 71^\circ = 19^\circ \) because \( \angle ARB \) is the complement of \( \angle ARS \) in the right triangle \( ARB \).

3. **Finding \( \angle QST \):**
   - Since \( Q \) lies on the circle centered at \( B \) and \( T \) lies on the same circle, \( \angle QBT = 90^\circ \) (radius to the point on the circle forms a right angle).
   - Therefore, \( \angle QTS = 180^\circ - \angle QBT - \angle BQT = 180^\circ - 90^\circ - 74^\circ = 17^\circ \).

4. **Summing Up:**
   - We need to find \( \widehat{QTS} \). Since \( T \) lies on the circle centered at \( B \) with radius 5 units and \( Q \) lies on the same circle, the arc \( QT \) is part of the circle's circumference.
   - The central angle subtended by \( QT \) is \( 180^\circ - \angle QTS = 180^\circ - 17^\circ = 163^\circ \).
   - Since \( T \) and \( S \) are on the circle, the arc \( TS \) is part of this central angle.
   - The total arc \( QTS \) is therefore \( 360^\circ - 163^\circ = 197^\circ \).

### Step 3: Conclude and Select

Given the calculation above, \( \widehat{QTS} = 197^\circ \), but since we're looking for the measure of the arc \( QTS \) in terms of the provided options, we need to consider the supplementary relationship:

- The arcs \( QTS \) and \( QTS' \) are supplementary, meaning their sum is \( 360^\circ \).

Thus, \( \widehat{QTS'} = 360^\circ - 197^\circ = 163^\circ \).

Since the options do not match, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the problem setup or a need to re-evaluate the given conditions. However, based on the information provided, the most appropriate choice would be:
