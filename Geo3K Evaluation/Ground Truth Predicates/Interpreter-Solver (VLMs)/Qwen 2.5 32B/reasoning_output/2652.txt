QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of right triangles and trigonometric ratios. Given that \(a = 14\), \(b = 48\), and \(c = 50\), where \(c\) is the hypotenuse, we can infer that triangle \(ABC\) is a right triangle with \(\angle ACB = 90^\circ\).

We need to find \(\sin A\). By definition, \(\sin A\) is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in the right triangle \(ABC\). Here, the opposite side to angle \(A\) is \(b = 48\) and the hypotenuse is \(c = 50\).

Therefore,
\[
\sin A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{48}{50} = \frac{24}{25}.
\]

Since \(\frac{24}{25}\) is approximately equal to \(0.96\), which is closest to \(0.96\) but slightly less than \(0.96\), the closest option among the given choices is \(0.96\).

Thus, the answer is:
