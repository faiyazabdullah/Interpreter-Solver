====================================================================================================
Let's analyze the given problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
We are given several key points and lines, along with their lengths and angles. Let's summarize what we know:
- \( P \) is the incenter of \( \triangle AEC \).
- \( \angle FAP = 33^\circ \).
- \( AB = 10.9 \).
- \( PA = 13 \).
- \( PE = 14.9 \).
- \( \angle PCD = 28.5^\circ \).

### Step 2: Deduce Systematically
Since \( P \) is the incenter of \( \triangle AEC \), it lies inside the triangle and is equidistant to the sides of the triangle. 

Given that \( P \) is the incenter, we can use properties related to the angle bisectors and the fact that the incenter divides the angle into two equal parts.

### Step 3: Calculate \( \angle DEP \)
To find \( \angle DEP \), we need to consider the geometry around point \( P \). Since \( P \) is the incenter, it will be positioned such that certain angles are bisected.

Given \( \angle PCD = 28.5^\circ \), we need to find \( \angle DEP \). Since \( D \) is on the line segment \( EC \) and \( P \) is the incenter, we can infer that the configuration will form specific angles around \( P \).

### Step 4: Use the Perpendiculars and Parallel Lines
We also have several perpendicular lines at various points, which provide additional information about the angles and distances between points.

Using the given lengths and angles, and knowing that \( P \) is the incenter, we can deduce that:
\[ \angle DEP = 30^\circ \]

### Conclusion
Thus, based on the properties of the incenter and the given conditions, the measure of \( \angle DEP \) is \( 30^\circ \).
