To solve this problem, we need to find the length of \(x\) using the given information and geometric properties. Let's proceed step by step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Key Elements:**
   - From the problem, we have a rectangle \(ABCD\) with \(AD = 16\), \(DB = 8\), and \(CB\) as the hypotenuse of the right triangle \(BCD\).
   - \(BD\) is the diagonal of the rectangle, so \(BD\) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by \(BC\) and \(CD\).

2. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   - Since \(BD\) is the diagonal of the rectangle, it can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the rectangle:
     \[
     BD = \sqrt{AD^2 + AB^2} = \sqrt{16^2 + 8^2} = \sqrt{256 + 64} = \sqrt{320} = 8\sqrt{5}
     \]

3. **Find \(x\) Using the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   - Now, consider the right triangle \(BCD\). Here, \(BC\) is one leg, \(CD\) is another leg, and \(BD\) is the hypotenuse. We know \(BD = 8\sqrt{5}\) and \(CD = 8\).
   - Let \(x\) be the length of \(BC\). Using the Pythagorean theorem again:
     \[
     BD^2 = BC^2 + CD^2
     \]
     Substituting the known values:
     \[
     (8\sqrt{5})^2 = x^2 + 8^2
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     320 = x^2 + 64
     \]
     Solving for \(x^2\):
     \[
     x^2 = 320 - 64 = 256
     \]
     Taking the square root of both sides:
     \[
     x = \sqrt{256} = 16
     \]

However, upon reviewing the options provided, none of them match our calculated value of \(x = 16\). This suggests there might have been a misunderstanding or error in the problem statement or options. 

Given the problem constraints and options provided, the closest match would be:
