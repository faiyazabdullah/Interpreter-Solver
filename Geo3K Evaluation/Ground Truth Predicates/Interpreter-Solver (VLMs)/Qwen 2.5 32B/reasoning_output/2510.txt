To find the length of JK, let's analyze the given information and apply relevant geometric principles:

1. **Radius of Circle J**: 10 units
2. **Radius of Circle K**: 8 units
3. **Length of Line Segment BC**: 5.4 units

Given these details, we need to determine the distance between points J and K. Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

### Step 1: Analyze the Circles' Positions
- Circle J is centered at point J with a radius of 10 units.
- Circle K is centered at point K with a radius of 8 units.

### Step 2: Position of Points B, C, and Their Relations
- Point B lies on both circles J and K.
- Length of Line Segment BC = 5.4 units.

### Step 3: Use the Law of Cosines
We can use the Law of Cosines in triangle BJC to find the angle at B where it meets circle K:
\[ BC^2 = BJ^2 + BK^2 - 2 \cdot BJ \cdot BK \cdot \cos(\angle JBC) \]

However, since we don't have enough information about the specific configuration of the points relative to the circle centers, we need to consider the general geometric properties.

### Step 4: Simplify Using Geometric Properties
Since B is equidistant from the centers of both circles (due to B lying on both), and considering the distances provided:
- The distance from the center of circle J (J) to B is 10 units (radius).
- The distance from the center of circle K (K) to B is 8 units (radius).

### Step 5: Use Right Triangle Properties
Given the distances, the distance from J to K can be derived using the Pythagorean theorem applied to the right triangle formed by the segments extending from J and K through B.

### Step 6: Calculate the Distance JK
Using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by:
\[ J = (0, 0) \]
\[ K = (8, 0) \]
\[ B = (5.4, 0) \]

The distance calculation:
\[ JK = \sqrt{(8 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{64} = 8 \]

However, this doesn't align with our options. Revisiting the configurations and distances again:

Given the complexity and the need for accurate application of geometric properties, re-evaluate:
- Given B is equidistant but forms right triangles due to circle radii.

Revised approach:
- Applying the given lengths directly:
  - Distance from J to B = 10
  - Distance from K to B = 8
  - Using Pythagorean theorem in adjusted triangle configurations.

Upon reassessment, the correct configuration yields:
\[ JK = \sqrt{(8+10)^2 - 5.4^2} = \sqrt{256 - 29.16} = \sqrt{226.84} \approx 15.06 \]

Therefore, the closest option:
\[ \boxed{D} \]
