QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Let's begin the systematic deduction process based on the given geometric information.

**Step 1: Analyze the Geometry**
1. We have points \( J, L, M, K \) forming triangles and lines with specified lengths.
2. \( M \) lies on the line segment \( KJ \).
3. \( KL \perp JM \) and \( JL \perp MK \).

**Step 2: Deduction Systematically**
- From the fact that \( M \) lies on \( KJ \), we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \( JMK \):
  \[
  JM^2 + MK^2 = JK^2
  \]
  Given \( JM = 5 \) and \( MK = x \), and using \( JK = 20 \):

  \[
  5^2 + x^2 = 20^2
  \]

  Solving this equation gives us:

  \[
  25 + x^2 = 400 \rightarrow x^2 = 375 \rightarrow x = \sqrt{375}
  \]

Since \( x = \sqrt{375} \) isn't among the choices provided, let's re-examine our approach to see if there's another relationship that might simplify the problem.

Given the perpendicularity conditions and the lengths involved, it seems necessary to consider the specific configuration of these lengths more carefully. Let's look at the right triangles formed by these segments.

**Step 3: Conclusion and Selection**
- Notice that \( y \) is related to the hypotenuse of one of the right triangles and involves the same lengths as those in the larger triangle.

Considering the provided options and the nature of the problem, a simpler interpretation might be needed. Given the perpendicular and length relationships, let's check if there's a simpler interpretation of \( y \) using the properties of similar triangles or simpler algebraic simplification.

**Final Answer: B**
