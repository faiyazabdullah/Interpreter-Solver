To solve this problem, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Identify Key Elements:**
   - Point \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \) are points on a circle centered at \( C \) with radius \( r = 2 \).
   - \( A \), \( B \), and \( D \) are collinear.
   - \( \angle ADB = 30^\circ \).

2. **Deduction Systematically:**
   - Since \( A \), \( B \), and \( D \) are collinear and \( D \) lies on the circumference of the circle, the angle \( \angle ADB \) subtended by the arc \( AB \) at point \( D \) is equal to \( 30^\circ \).
   - In a circle, an angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle (90°). Therefore, \( \angle ACB \) is a right angle because \( C \) is the center of the circle and \( AB \) is a diameter.
   - Since \( \angle ACB \) is a right angle, it means \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \).

3. **Conclusion and Selection:**
   - The angle \( \angle 2 \) is part of the triangle \( ABD \), which is inscribed in the circle such that \( AB \) is the diameter.
   - Since \( AB \) is a diameter, \( \angle ACB \) being 90° confirms that \( \angle ADB = 30^\circ \) is indeed correct.
   - Therefore, the angle \( \angle 2 \) is supplementary to \( \angle ADB \), making \( \angle 2 = 180^\circ - 30^\circ = 150^\circ \).

However, based on the options provided, none of them match our conclusion directly. This indicates there might be a misinterpretation or a different approach needed.

Given the options:
A. 30
B. 45
C. 60
D. 90

The closest logical deduction based on the given conditions is:
