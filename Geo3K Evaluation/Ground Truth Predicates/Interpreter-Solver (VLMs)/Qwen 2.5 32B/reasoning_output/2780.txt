QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Let's start by analyzing the given information:

1. **Equal Arc Length**: The measure of arc \(BE\) is equal to \(120^\circ\).
2. **Equal Angle**: The measure of angle \(ABC\) is equal to the measure of angle \(9\).
3. **Line Relationship**: Point \(E\) lies on line \(AB\).
4. **Circle Relationships**: Points \(B\), \(D\), and \(E\) all lie on circle \(D\) with radius 3 units.

Given these conditions, we need to find the measure of angle \(9\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Key Elements**:
   - Arc \(BE = 120^\circ\).
   - \(\angle ABC = \angle 9\).
   - Point \(E\) on line \(AB\).
   - Circles with radius 3 units centered at \(D\) have \(B\), \(D\), and \(E\) as points.

2. **Using the Inscribed Angle Theorem**:
   - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
   - Therefore, if the arc \(BE = 120^\circ\), then \(\angle BEC = \frac{1}{2} \times 120^\circ = 60^\circ\).

3. **Angle Relationships**:
   - Since \(E\) is on line \(AB\) and considering the cyclic nature of the circle, \(\angle BCD = \angle BED\).
   - Given that \( \angle ABC = \angle 9 \) and knowing \(\angle BCD = \angle BED\), we can infer that \(\angle 9 = \angle BCD\).

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - From the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and the fact that the sum of opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral is \(180^\circ\):
     - If \(\angle BCD = \angle BED = x\), then:
     - \(x + x = 180^\circ\), thus \(2x = 180^\circ\) and \(x = 90^\circ\).

Therefore, \(\angle 9 = 90^\circ\).

### Conclusion:

Since none of the options provided match \(90^\circ\), it seems there might be an error in the problem setup or the choices given. However, based on the analysis:
