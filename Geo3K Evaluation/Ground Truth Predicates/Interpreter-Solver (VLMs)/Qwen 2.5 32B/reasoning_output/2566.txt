**1. ANALYZE & EXTRACT**
- From the image, we have a parallelogram ABCD with base AD and height BE.
- The length of BC is given as x + 10.
- The length of AB is equal to the length of AD, which is x.
- Point E lies on line BD, and BE is perpendicular to BD.

**2. DEDUCE SYSTEMATICALLY**
- Since ABCD is a parallelogram, the height of the parallelogram is the same as the length of BE.
- The area of the parallelogram is given by the formula: Area = base × height.
- Therefore, 2000 = AD × BE.
- Since AD = x and BE = x, we have 2000 = x × x.
- Solving this equation gives us x² = 2000.
- Taking the square root of both sides, we get x = √2000.

**3. CONCLUDE & SELECT**
- The height of the parallelogram is x.
- Therefore, the height is √2000.

Let's calculate √2000:

√2000 ≈ 44.72

Since √2000 is closer to 40 than 30, 50, or 60, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
