====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and properties of rhombuses and triangles. Hereâ€™s a systematic approach:

1. **Identify Key Elements and Relationships:**
   - We have a rhombus \(LMQP\) where \(M\) is such that \(MP = 10\) and \(ML\) is a line segment extending from \(M\) to some point beyond \(P\).
   - Angles: \(m \angle QLM = 2x^2 - 10\) and \(m \angle QPM = 8x\).
   - Length: \(MP = 10\).

2. **Use Triangle Properties:**
   - Since \(LMQP\) is a rhombus, all sides are equal. Thus, \(LP = LP = MQ = MQ = 10\).
   - Consider triangle \(QPM\). Given \(m \angle QPM = 8x\) and \(m \angle QLM = 2x^2 - 10\), we can find the measure of \(\angle QML\) by noting that \(\angle QML = 180^\circ - m \angle QPM - m \angle QLM\).

3. **Calculate the Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter \(PQ + QM + MP + ML\) involves finding \(ML\) which is essentially the length of a line extending from \(M\) to extend beyond \(P\) but maintaining the properties of the rhombus.

Since we don't have explicit values for \(x\), let's infer from the options provided.

Given that \(m \angle QPM = 8x\) and considering typical values often associated with such problems, let's assume \(x\) could be derived based on typical problem setups.

Let's calculate assuming typical values often seen in such problems:

For simplicity, consider \(x = 5\):
\[ m \angle QPM = 8 \times 5 = 40 \]
\[ m \angle QLM = 2 \times 5^2 - 10 = 2 \times 25 - 10 = 50 - 10 = 40 \]

This implies \(\angle QPM = \angle QLM = 40^\circ\), making \(\angle QML = 100^\circ\) because \(180^\circ - 40^\circ - 40^\circ = 100^\circ\).

Therefore, all sides are 10 units long as per the rhombus property:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = LP + LM + MP + MQ = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 \]

Thus, the perimeter is 40.
