To find the circumference of the circle, we need to first determine its radius. Given that $AB$ is a diameter and $AC$ is a chord with length 6.2 cm, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the radius.

Let's denote the radius as $r$. Since $AB$ is the diameter, its length is $2r$. We also know that $AC$ is a chord, and by the power of a point theorem, we have:

\[ AC^2 = AB \cdot BC \]

Since $BC = AB$, we substitute and solve for $r$:

\[ (6.2)^2 = (2r)(2r) \]
\[ 38.44 = 4r^2 \]
\[ r^2 = \frac{38.44}{4} \]
\[ r^2 = 9.61 \]
\[ r = \sqrt{9.61} \]
\[ r \approx 3.1 \text{ cm} \]

Now that we have the radius, we can calculate the circumference using the formula for the circumference of a circle:

\[ \text{Circumference} = 2\pi r \]
\[ \text{Circumference} \approx 2 \times \pi \times 3.1 \]
\[ \text{Circumference} \approx 19.5 \text{ cm} \]

Thus, the closest option is B.
