QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**ANALYSIS:**
- We have a circle with center \( X \).
- Points \( A \) and \( B \) are endpoints of a diameter with \( AB = 30 \).
- Points \( C \) and \( D \) are endpoints of another diameter with \( CD = 30 \).
- The measure of arc \( CZ \) is \( 40^\circ \).

Since \( A \) and \( B \) are endpoints of a diameter, they subtend a right angle at the circumference. Therefore, \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \).

Similarly, since \( C \) and \( D \) are endpoints of another diameter, they also subtend a right angle at the circumference. Thus, \( \angle ADB = 90^\circ \).

Given that \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \) and \( \angle ADB = 90^\circ \), we can infer that points \( A, C, D, \) and \( B \) form a cyclic quadrilateral where opposite angles sum up to \( 180^\circ \).

Using the inscribed angle theorem, we know that:
\[ \text{Measure of } \angle CAD = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{arc } CD = \frac{1}{2} \times 40^\circ = 20^\circ \]

Now, let's consider the arcs:
- Arc \( AZ \) is part of the full circle and its measure plus the given arc \( CZ \) equals \( 360^\circ \):
\[ \text{Measure of arc } AZ = 360^\circ - \text{Measure of arc } CZ = 360^\circ - 40^\circ = 320^\circ \]

Since \( AZ \) is a semicircle (half-circle) and \( \angle ACZ \) is formed by intersecting chords, we use the fact that the angle subtended by a chord in a semicircle is \( 90^\circ \):

Thus:
\[ \angle ACZ = 90^\circ \]

Finally, we need to find \( \angle CDZ \). Since \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \) and \( \angle ADB = 90^\circ \), and considering the properties of the circle and the inscribed angles:

Therefore, \( \angle CDZ = 180^\circ - \angle ACB = 180^\circ - 90^\circ = 90^\circ \).

Hence, the measure of arc \( CD \) is \( 90^\circ \).

**CONCLUSION:**
