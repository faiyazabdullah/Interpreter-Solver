QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Let's analyze the given information:

1. **Given Information**:
   - \(X\) and \(Y\) lie on \(RS\), and \(XY = 7\).
   - \(X\) and \(Z\) lie on \(TS\), and \(XZ = 7\).
   - \(\angle XYZ = 124^\circ\).
   - \(RT = 13\).

2. **Objective**: To find \(ST\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Understanding Midsegment Properties:
- In a triangle, a midsegment is parallel to one side and half its length.

#### Step 2: Analyzing Midsegment \(XY\):
Since \(X\) and \(Y\) lie on \(RS\), and \(XY = 7\), we infer that \(Y\) is the midpoint of \(RS\) because \(XY\) is a midsegment.

#### Step 3: Analyzing Midsegment \(XZ\):
Similarly, since \(X\) and \(Z\) lie on \(TS\), and \(XZ = 7\), we infer that \(Z\) is the midpoint of \(TS\) because \(XZ\) is also a midsegment.

#### Step 4: Considering Triangle Symmetry:
Given \(XY = XZ = 7\) and \(\angle XYZ = 124^\circ\), we can infer that \(\triangle XYZ\) is symmetric about the line \(XZ\), which means \(YZ = 7\) as well since \(Y\) and \(Z\) are equidistant from \(X\) on \(TS\).

#### Step 5: Calculating \(ST\):
Since \(Y\) and \(Z\) are midpoints:
- \(RT = RT = 13\)
- Therefore, \(XY = XY = 7\) and \(XZ = XZ = 7\)

Since \(XY = XZ = 7\) and considering the properties of midsegments and symmetry, we conclude:
- \(ST = XY + XZ = 7 + 7 = 14\)

Thus, the length of \(ST\) is 14.
