Let's analyze the problem systematically.

Given:
1. \(MC = 7\)
2. \(RM = 4\)
3. \(AT = 16\)

We need to find \(MB\).

First, let's use the given information about the lengths of the segments and the points where they lie on lines.

Since \(M\) lies on \(CM\) and \(R\) lies on \(CA\), we can deduce that \(MR\) is a part of the segment \(AM\). Therefore, we need to find the length of \(AM\) first.

From the given information:
\[ AT = 16 \]
Since \(T\) is between \(A\) and \(B\) and \(AT = 16\), we can infer that \(AB = AT + TB\). But since \(TB\) is not directly given, we need to look at the other segments.

Now, let's consider the segments \(AR\) and \(RM\):
\[ AR = AM - RM \]
Since \(RM = 4\), we need to find \(AM\).

From the diagram and the given information, we know that \(A\), \(T\), and \(B\) are collinear with \(A\) and \(B\) being endpoints of a segment passing through \(T\) such that \(AT = 16\).

Now, let's look at the triangle \(AMB\):
Since \(M\) is on \(AC\) and \(A\), \(M\), and \(B\) are collinear, we can use the fact that the sum of the lengths of the segments from \(A\) to \(B\) via \(M\) should be consistent with the total length of \(AB\).

From the diagram and the given lengths:
\[ AM = AC - MC = 7 - 4 = 3 \]

So, the length of \(AM\) is 3 units. Now, we need to find the length of \(MB\).

Since \(A\), \(M\), and \(B\) are collinear, and \(AM = 3\) and \(AT = 16\), we can infer that \(MB\) will be the remaining part of the segment \(AB\).

Therefore, \(MB = AB - AM = 16 - 3 = 13\).

However, the options provided do not match this calculation. Let's re-evaluate using the given choices:

Given the options, the correct interpretation might be that \(MB\) is actually the difference between \(AB\) and \(AM\), but since the problem does not provide \(AB\) directly, we need to consider the relationship between the segments.

The correct interpretation should be that \(MB = AB - AM = AB - 3\), and since the problem provides options, we need to find the correct one based on the given choices.

The correct answer based on the given choices and the logical deductions is:
