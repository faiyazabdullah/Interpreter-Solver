QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Let's start by analyzing the given information and drawing conclusions based on it.

1. **Identify Key Elements and Relationships:**
   - Circles \(G\), \(J\), and \(K\) all intersect at point \(L\).
   - The length of segment \(GH = 10\).
   - Point \(L\) lies on lines \(JG\) and \(LG\).
   - Points \(F\) and \(H\) lie on circle \(G\) such that \(FH\) is a chord.

2. **Deduction Systematically:**
   - Since \(L\) is the intersection of three circles, \(L\) is equidistant from the centers of these circles.
   - Given \(GH = 10\), and knowing that \(F\) and \(H\) are endpoints of a chord in circle \(G\), we need to find the length of \(FH\).

3. **Using Properties of Circles and Chords:**
   - Since \(L\) is the intersection of the circles, and \(L\) is equidistant from the centers of these circles, the configuration implies that \(FH\) is a diameter of circle \(G\).
   - The length of the diameter can be found using the Pythagorean theorem if we consider the right triangle formed by the radius and half of the chord.

4. **Calculate the Diameter:**
   - Let's denote the radius of circle \(G\) as \(r\). Since \(GH = 10\), which is a chord, and \(L\) is the center of the circle, we have two radii from \(L\) to \(G\) and \(H\), forming a right triangle with the chord \(GH\).
   - By the Pythagorean theorem in this right triangle, \(GH = 2 \times \sqrt{(2r)^2 - r^2} = 10\).
   - Simplifying, we get \(2\sqrt{3}r = 10\), so \(r = \frac{10}{2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{3}}\).

5. **Determine the Length of \(FH\):**
   - The diameter of circle \(G\) is \(2r = 10\).

Thus, the length of \(FH\) is \(10\).

**Final Answer:** B
