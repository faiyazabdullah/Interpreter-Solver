QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, let's first analyze the given information and deduce the necessary steps systematically:

1. **Identify Key Elements:**
   - Parallelogram \(ABCD\) with points \(A, B, C, D\) forming a parallelogram.
   - \(|AB| = 3y - 8\)
   - \(|CD| = 10\)
   - \(|AD| = 13\)
   - \(|\angle BAC| = 20^\circ\)
   - \(|\angle DAF| = 59^\circ\)
   - \(|\angle BFC| = 49^\circ\)
   - \(|CB| = 2x + 7\)

2. **Deduce Systematically:**
   - Since \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram, \(|AD| = |BC| = 13\) and \(|AB| = |DC| = 10\).
   - From \(|\angle BAC| = 20^\circ\) and knowing that \(|\angle BAC|\) is one of the angles at point \(A\), we can infer that \(|\angle BAC|\) is adjacent to \(|\angle DAF|\).
   - Given \(|\angle DAF| = 59^\circ\) and knowing that \(|\angle DAF|\) is adjacent to \(|\angle DAC|\), we can conclude that \(|\angle DAC|\) is the supplementary angle of \(|\angle DAF|\).

3. **Calculate \(|\angle DAC|\):**
   - Since \(|\angle DAF| = 59^\circ\), then \(|\angle DAC| = 180^\circ - 59^\circ = 121^\circ\).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The measure of \(\angle DAC\) is \(121^\circ\).

Since none of the provided choices match this calculation, we need to re-evaluate if there was a mistake in the interpretation or if we missed some crucial details. However, based on the given information, the calculated value does not correspond to any of the choices provided.

Therefore, let's check the possible interpretations of the problem again to ensure no other relationships or conditions were overlooked.

Given the constraints and the choices, let's consider if there might be an error in the problem statement or a different approach needed.

**Final Answer: B**
