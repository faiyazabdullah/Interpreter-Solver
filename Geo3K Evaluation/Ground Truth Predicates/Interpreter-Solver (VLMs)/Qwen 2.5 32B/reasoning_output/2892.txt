QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Let's begin our systematic deduction based on the given information:

1. **Identify Key Elements:**
   - \(P\) is the centroid of \(\triangle XYZ\).
   - \(KP = 3\).
   - \(XJ = 8\).
   - Points lie on lines as specified.

2. **Deduce Systematically:**
   Since \(P\) is the centroid, it divides each median into a ratio of 2:1. Therefore, if we draw the medians from \(X\) to \(YZ\), \(Y\) to \(ZX\), and \(Z\) to \(XY\), each median will be divided such that \(XP : PJ = 2:1\) and similarly for other medians.

   Given \(XJ = 8\) and knowing that \(P\) divides \(XJ\) into segments where \(XP : PJ = 2:1\), let's denote \(PJ\) as \(x\). Hence, \(XP = 2x\).

   Since \(XP + PJ = XJ\):
   \[
   2x + x = 8 \implies 3x = 8 \implies x = \frac{8}{3}
   \]

   So, \(PJ = \frac{8}{3}\) and \(XP = 2 \times \frac{8}{3} = \frac{16}{3}\).

   Now, since \(KP = 3\), we know \(K\) is the midpoint of \(PX\), thus \(KP = \frac{1}{2} PX = \frac{16}{3} / 2 = \frac{8}{3}\).

3. **Conclusion:**
   Since \(K\) lies on \(YP\) and \(KP = 3\), and knowing that \(P\) is the centroid, we can deduce the total length of \(YP\):

   Since \(P\) is the centroid and divides the median into a ratio of 2:1, the total length of \(YP\) would be twice the length of \(PJ\):
   \[
   YP = 2 \times \frac{8}{3} = \frac{16}{3}
   \]

   However, considering the geometry of the triangle and the centroid properties, the total length \(YP\) should match the given conditions without additional internal divisions. 

   Thus, \(YP = 8\).

Therefore, the final answer is:
