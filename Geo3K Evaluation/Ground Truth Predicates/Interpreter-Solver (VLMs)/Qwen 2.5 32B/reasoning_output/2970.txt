====================================================================================================
**BEGIN ANALYSIS**

Given:
- Angle at point C, Angle(C, Y, B) = 23°
- Length of Line WX = 4
- Length of Line WZ = 4
- Point L lies on line YZ
- Point X lies on line YB
- Point W lies on line YC
- Perpendicular Line(X, W) to Line(X, Y)
- Perpendicular Line(Z, Y) to Line(Z, W)

**DEDUCTION SYSTEMATICALLY**

1. From the given information, we have two right triangles, XYZ and WXY due to the perpendicular lines. 

2. Since WX = WZ = 4 and angle CWX is equal to angle CWZ because they share the same side W and angle C is common to both triangles. This implies that triangle CWX and triangle CWZ are congruent by the Side-Side-Side (SSS) Congruence Theorem.

3. Therefore, angle CZW = angle CXW which is equal to half of angle C. Since angle C = 23°, angle CZW = angle CXW = 11.5°.

4. Now, considering triangle WYX, since WX and WZ are perpendicular to Y and Z respectively, angle WXY = angle WZY = 90°.

5. Hence, angle WYZ can be found by subtracting angle CZW from angle WXY as follows:
   - angle WYZ = angle WXY - angle CZW
   - angle WYZ = 90° - 11.5°
   - angle WYZ = 78.5°

6. Finally, angle WYZ is 78.5°, which corresponds to choice D.

**CONCLUSION**
