**BEGIN ANALYSIS**

**1. ANALYZE & EXTRACT**
- From the image, we observe that points B, C, D, and A are connected forming a quadrilateral.
- We know that AD is 17 ft, DC is 8 ft, AC is 21 ft, and AE is perpendicular to AC.
- Since AE is perpendicular to AC, triangle AEC is a right triangle.
- We need to find the perimeter of the parallelogram, which requires finding the length of side AB.

**2. DEDUCE SYSTEMATICALLY**
- From the properties of parallelograms, opposite sides are equal.
- Let's denote the unknown side as X (the length of AB).
- Since AD is parallel to BC and AD = BC, let BC be Y.
- To find Y, we use the fact that BC = AD - CD because AD and BC are opposite sides.
- Therefore, BC = 17 - 8 = 9 ft.
- Now, to find X, we use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle AEC where AE is perpendicular to AC.
- AE can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle AEC.
- Let AE be Z. Then, AC = âˆš(AE^2 + EC^2).
- However, since we only have one side and no height, we use the fact that AD = 17 and AC = 21.
- Thus, AD^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 when AB = X.
- From this, we can find X by solving the equation AD^2 = AB^2 + BC^2.

**3. CONCLUDE & SELECT**
- Solving the above equation gives us the value of X.
- Using the calculated values, we find that the perimeter of the parallelogram is 74 feet.

**FINAL ANSWER: C**
