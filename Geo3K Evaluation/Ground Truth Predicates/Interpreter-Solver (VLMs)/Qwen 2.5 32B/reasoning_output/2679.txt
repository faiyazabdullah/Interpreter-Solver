QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Given the problem, let's break it down systematically:

1. **Identify Key Elements**: From the given predicates, we know that:
   - Angle EFG = 55°
   - Angle GCH = 55°
   - Point A lies on the line segment FH.
   - Points G and H lie on the lines AH and BH respectively.
   - Parallel lines GC and FE have a specific measure relationship.
   
2. **Deduction Systematically**:
   - Since GC is parallel to FE, the angle between GC and EF is equal to the angle between GC and GH, which is 55° because of the transversal GH.
   - Since FGH is a straight line, the sum of angles at point F should be 180°.
   - Therefore, angle GFE can be found as follows:
     \[
     \text{Angle } GFE = 180° - 55° - 55° = 70°
     \]
   - Since point A lies on the line segment FG, the angle between AC and AF is 70° due to the parallel lines property.

3. **Conclusion and Selection**:
   - Given that the angle between AC and AF is 70°, the measure \(x\) is directly related to the angle formed by AC and AF.
   - Therefore, the value of \(x\) is 70°.
