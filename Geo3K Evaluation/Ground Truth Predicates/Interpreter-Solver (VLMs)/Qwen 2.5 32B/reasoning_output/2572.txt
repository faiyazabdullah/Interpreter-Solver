Let's begin by analyzing the given information and breaking down the problem step-by-step.

### Step 1: Analyze Key Elements
- **Angle Relationships**: 
  - Measure of ∠NMP = 56°
  - Measure of ∠PMN = 45°

- **Line Relationships**:
  - Point Q lies on line segment PN.

### Step 2: Deduce Systematically

#### Step 2.1: Determine ∠QPN
Since ∠PMN = 45°, we can find ∠QPN by subtracting ∠PMN from the straight angle:

\[
∠QPN = 180° - ∠PMN = 180° - 45° = 135°
\]

#### Step 2.2: Calculate ∠MPQ
We know ∠NMP = 56° and ∠QPN = 135°. To find ∠MPQ, we use the fact that the sum of angles around point P should be 360° (since it is around point P).

\[
∠MPQ = 360° - (∠NMP + ∠PMN + ∠QPN)
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
∠MPQ = 360° - (56° + 45° + 135°) = 360° - 236° = 124°
\]

However, this does not match the choices provided, suggesting there might have been a misinterpretation or error in the initial setup or choices. Let’s re-evaluate using the given options directly.

### Step 3: Conclusion Based on Choices

Given the options:
A. 45
B. 56
C. 79
D. 101

And considering our calculations might have been incorrect due to misinterpretation, let's check the choices against the original problem setup:

- Option A (45): This seems too small based on our calculated value.
- Option B (56): This matches the measure of ∠NMP but does not account for other angles.
- Option C (79): This seems to fit better as it involves combining measures logically.
- Option D (101): This is larger than expected.

### Final Calculation Review:
Given the setup and choices, let's review:
- We need to consider ∠MNP = 56° and ∠PQN = 45°.
- Since Q is on PN, ∠QPN = 135°, which fits well with choices but not directly matching our direct calculation.

Therefore, based on the choices provided, the closest reasonable fit would align with a supplementary angle relationship.

**Final Answer:** C
