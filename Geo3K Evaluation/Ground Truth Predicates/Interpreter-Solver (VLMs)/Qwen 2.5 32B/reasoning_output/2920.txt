====================================================================================================
Let's begin by analyzing the given information:

1. **Trapezoid Q R T U**: This confirms our understanding of the geometric figure.
2. **V is the midpoint of Leg Of(Trapezoid Q R T U)**: This means V lies halfway along one leg of the trapezoid.
3. **S is the midpoint of Leg Of(Trapezoid Q R T U)**: Similarly, S lies halfway along another leg of the trapezoid.
4. **Q R = 4**: The length of one leg is 4 units.
5. **U T = 16**: The length of the opposite leg is 16 units.
6. **PointLiesOnLine(S, Line(T, R))**: This indicates that point S lies on the line segment TR.
7. **PointLiesOnLine(V, Line(U, Q))**: This means point V lies on the line segment UQ.

Since V and S are midpoints of the legs, we can infer that V divides QR into two equal parts and similarly, S divides UT into two equal parts. 

To find VS, note that since V and S lie on the diagonals of the trapezoid, we need to consider their positions relative to the legs. 

Given the properties of midpoints and the fact that V and S are midpoints, we have:

\[ \text{VS} = \frac{1}{2}(QR + UT) \]

This formula comes from the fact that the sum of the lengths of the bases of a trapezoid divided by two gives us the distance between the midpoints of the legs.

Now let's calculate this:

\[ \text{VS} = \frac{1}{2}(4 + 16) = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Thus, the distance VS is 10 units.
