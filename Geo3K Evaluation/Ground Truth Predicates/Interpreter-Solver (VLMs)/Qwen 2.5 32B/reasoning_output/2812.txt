QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to use the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and the sum of interior angles of a quadrilateral.

Given:
1. Quadrilateral \(WXYZ\) is inscribed in circle \(\odot V\).
2. \(\angle XYZ = 60^\circ\).
3. \(\angle WXZ = 95^\circ\).

We need to find \(\angle X\).

Since \(WXYZ\) is a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of opposite angles is \(180^\circ\). Therefore, \(\angle X + \angle YWZ = 180^\circ\).

We also know that the angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice the angle subtended at any point on the circumference. Since \(\angle YZW = 60^\circ\), the central angle subtended by the arc \(YZ\) is \(120^\circ\).

Now, consider \(\triangle WXZ\). The measure of \(\angle WXZ\) is given as \(95^\circ\). Since \(\angle WXZ + \angle X + \angle WXZ = 180^\circ\), we can find \(\angle X\) by subtracting the given angle from \(180^\circ\):

\[
\angle X = 180^\circ - 95^\circ = 85^\circ
\]

Therefore, the measure of \(\angle X\) is \(85^\circ\).
