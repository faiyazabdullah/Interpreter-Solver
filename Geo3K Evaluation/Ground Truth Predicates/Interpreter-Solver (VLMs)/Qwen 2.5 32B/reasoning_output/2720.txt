QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Let's start by analyzing the given information and the relationships between the points and lines in the geometric figure.

Given:
1. Rectangle L MN P
2. Parallelogram L KM J
3. Length of Line LN = 10
4. Length of Line LJ = 2x + 1
5. Length of Line PJ = 3x - 1
6. Point L lies on Line PM
7. Point L lies on Line NL

Since L MN P is a rectangle, it means that the opposite sides are equal, so LM = NP and ML = PN. Also, since L KM J is a parallelogram, it means that the opposite sides are equal, so LK = MJ and KL = JM.

We know that LN = 10, so we can use this as a reference point for our calculations.

Now, let's consider the lengths:
1. Length of Line LJ = 2x + 1
2. Length of Line PJ = 3x - 1

Since LK = MJ, and LKMJ is a parallelogram, the length of LK is equal to the length of MJ which is equal to the length of LJ.

Now, let's use the fact that point L lies on line NL. This means that NL = LN = 10.

Since LJ = 2x + 1 and PJ = 3x - 1, we can set up an equation based on these lengths:

\[ 2x + 1 + 3x - 1 = 10 \]

Solving this equation will give us the value of x:

\[ 5x = 10 \]
\[ x = 2 \]

So, the value of x is 2.
