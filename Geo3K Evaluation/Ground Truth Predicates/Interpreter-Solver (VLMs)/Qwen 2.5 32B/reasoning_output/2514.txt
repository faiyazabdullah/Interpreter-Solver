QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Key Elements and Relationships**:
   - \(GJ = 8\)
   - \(GH = 12\)
   - \(HI = 4\)
   - \(HJ = 1\) (from parallel lines)
   - \(HK \parallel HJ\)

2. **Draw Triangles and Use Given Lengths**:
   Since \(GH\) is a straight line, we can use the given lengths to form two right triangles, \(GKH\) and \(GHJ\).

3. **Calculate Distances Using Pythagorean Theorem**:
   - In triangle \(GKH\):
     \[
     GK^2 + KH^2 = GH^2 \implies GK^2 + KH^2 = 12^2 \implies GK^2 + KH^2 = 144
     \]
   - In triangle \(GHJ\):
     \[
     GK^2 + HK^2 = GJ^2 \implies GK^2 + (HK)^2 = 8^2 \implies GK^2 + (HK)^2 = 64
     \]

4. **Subtract Equations**:
   Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us:
   \[
   144 - 64 = 80 \implies 16KJ = 80 \implies KJ = 5
   \]

5. **Recheck Calculation**:
   We realize there was a mistake in the calculation. Let's re-evaluate:
   - Correctly calculate distances using known values and relationships.
   - Use the fact that \(HK = HJ = 1\) and the Pythagorean theorem correctly.

6. **Correct Calculation**:
   - From \(GK^2 + KH^2 = 12^2 \implies GK^2 + 1^2 = 144 \implies GK^2 = 143 \implies GK = \sqrt{143}\)
   - From \(GK^2 + HK^2 = 8^2 \implies GK^2 + 1^2 = 64 \implies GK^2 = 63 \implies GK = \sqrt{63}\)

7. **Use Similar Triangles**:
   Since \(HK = HJ = 1\) and they are similar triangles, use the similarity ratio:
   \[
   \frac{GH}{GJ} = \frac{12}{8} = \frac{3}{2}
   \]
   Therefore, \(KH = \frac{3}{2} \times 1 = \frac{3}{2}\) and \(HK = \frac{3}{2} \times 1 = \frac{3}{2}\).

8. **Final Answer**:
   - Since \(KJ = HK = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5\), we need to find the correct answer among choices provided.

Final Answer: B
