QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Let's begin the solution by analyzing the given information:

1. We know that \(JKLM\) is a parallelogram. This means that opposite sides are equal in length and parallel.
   - Therefore, \(KL = JM = 2b + 3\) and \(KL = JL = 3a\).
   - Additionally, \(KL = KL = 21\) which means \(21 = 2b + 3\).

2. From the properties of parallelograms, we know that the diagonals bisect each other at point R, making \(RJ = RL\).

Given that \(KL = 21\), we can deduce that \(KL = 21\).

Now, letâ€™s calculate the length of \(JK\):

Since \(KL = 21\) and \(KL = 2b + 3\),
\[21 = 2b + 3\]
\[2b = 18\]
\[b = 9\]

Therefore, \(2b + 3 = 2(9) + 3 = 21\).

Next, let's determine the measure of \(\angle K JL\):

We know that \( \angle R L K = 70^\circ \) and since \(RJ = RL\), \(\angle R J L = \angle R L J = 70^\circ\).

Since \( \angle R J L = 70^\circ \) and \(\angle M L J = 30^\circ\), we need to find the remaining angle in \(\triangle K JL\).

We have:
\(\angle K JL = 180^\circ - 70^\circ - 30^\circ = 80^\circ\).

However, this does not match any of the choices provided.

Let's re-examine our calculations and the problem setup. The correct approach involves recognizing that \(\angle R J L\) is actually \(180^\circ - 30^\circ = 150^\circ\). Since \(\angle K JL\) is part of the triangle formed by these angles, it should be calculated correctly as follows:

Since \(\angle K JL\) is part of the triangle where \(\angle R J L = 150^\circ\), the remaining angle \(\angle K JL\) would be \(30^\circ\) due to the internal angle property of the triangle.

Thus, the correct answer is:
