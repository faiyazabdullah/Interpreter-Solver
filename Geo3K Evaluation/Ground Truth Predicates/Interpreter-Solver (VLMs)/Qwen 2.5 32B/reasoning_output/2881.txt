====================================================================================================
To find \( EG \) given that \( G \) is the incenter of \(\triangle ABC\), we need to analyze the geometric properties and relationships provided.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Key Elements:**
   - \( \triangle ABC \) with vertices \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
   - Point \( G \) is the incenter of \( \triangle ABC \).
   - \( EG \) is a segment inside \( \triangle ABC \).

2. **Given Relationships:**
   - \( \text{Perpendicular}(DG, DC) \)
   - \( \text{Perpendicular}(FG, FC) \)
   - \( \text{Perpendicular}(EG, EA) \)

3. **Key Observations:**
   - Since \( G \) is the incenter, it is equidistant from the sides of \( \triangle ABC \).
   - The perpendiculars to \( DC \), \( FC \), and \( EA \) indicate specific right angles at points \( G \), \( F \), and \( E \), respectively.

4. **Use of Perpendicularity:**
   - \( \text{Perpendicular}(DG, DC) \) implies \( DG \perp DC \).
   - \( \text{Perpendicular}(FG, FC) \) implies \( FG \perp FC \).
   - \( \text{Perpendicular}(EG, EA) \) implies \( EG \perp EA \).

5. **Implications of Perpendicularity:**
   - Since \( G \) is the incenter, \( G \) lies on the angle bisectors of \( \angle BAC \), \( \angle ABC \), and \( \angle BCA \).
   - Given the perpendiculars, we infer that \( G \) forms right angles with the sides at \( D \), \( F \), and \( E \).

6. **Positioning of Points:**
   - \( D \) lies on \( AC \) such that \( \text{Perpendicular}(DG, DC) \) holds.
   - \( F \) lies on \( BC \) such that \( \text{Perpendicular}(FG, FC) \) holds.
   - \( E \) lies on \( AB \) such that \( \text{Perpendicular}(EG, EA) \) holds.

7. **Geometric Configuration:**
   - Consider the configuration where \( G \) is the incenter and \( D \), \( F \), and \( E \) form right angles with the respective sides.
   - \( G \) will be equidistant from the sides \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( CA \).

8. **Calculate \( EG \):**
   - Given \( AC = 13 \) and \( BC = 12 \), and considering the distances formed by the perpendiculars:
     - \( D \) is on \( AC \), \( F \) is on \( BC \), and \( E \) is on \( AB \).
     - Using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangles formed by the perpendiculars and the sides:
       - Let \( AD = x \), \( CD = 13 - x \).
       - Similarly, let \( BF = y \), \( FC = 12 - y \).
       - By the Pythagorean theorem:
         \[
         AD^2 + BD^2 = AB^2
         \]
         \[
         CF^2 + BC^2 = AC^2
         \]

9. **Using Incenter Properties:**
   - Since \( G \) is the incenter, the distances from \( G \) to the sides are equal:
     - \( AG = BG = CG \).

10. **Conclusion:**
    - Given the perpendicular conditions and the fact that \( G \) is equidistant, the segment \( EG \) must be half of the hypotenuse formed by the right triangle properties.

11. **Final Calculation:**
    - Since \( EG \) is the median of the right triangle formed by the perpendiculars, and using the properties of the incenter and the given lengths, we find:
      \[
      EG = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{AB^2 + AC^2}
      \]
      Given the lengths \( AB \) and \( AC \) are not directly provided but inferred as symmetrical configurations:
      \[
      EG = \frac{1}{2} \times 13 = 6.5
      \]

However, based on the problem's options provided, the correct value is:
