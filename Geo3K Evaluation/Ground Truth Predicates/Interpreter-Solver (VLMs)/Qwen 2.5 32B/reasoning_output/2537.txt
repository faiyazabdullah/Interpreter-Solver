QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**Step 1:** From the given information, we know that \( \angle BFC = 72^\circ \) because it is an inscribed angle subtending the same arc as the diameter AC.

**Step 2:** Since \( AB \) and \( BC \) are chords passing through the center \( F \), they form a cyclic quadrilateral \( ABCF \). Therefore, \( \angle BFC \) and \( \angle BAD \) are supplementary angles because they lie on a straight line through point \( F \). Thus,
\[ \angle BAD = 180^\circ - \angle BFC = 180^\circ - 72^\circ = 108^\circ. \]

**Step 3:** We need to find \( \angle AFB \). Note that \( \angle AFB \) is part of triangle \( AFB \), where \( F \) is the center and \( A \) and \( B \) are points on the circle. Since \( F \) is the center, \( \angle AFB \) can be found by subtracting \( \angle BAD \) from \( 180^\circ \) because \( \angle AFB \) lies on the opposite side of the diameter \( AC \) in the semicircle formed by \( \angle BAD \).

Therefore,
\[ \angle AFB = 180^\circ - \angle BAD = 180^\circ - 108^\circ = 72^\circ. \]

**Step 4:** Since \( \angle AFB = 72^\circ \), the final answer is:
