QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Let's begin the analysis:

**1. ANALYZE & EXTRACT**
- From the image, we can see that points Y, X, and V lie on the same circle, as indicated by the blue lines forming angles at X.
- Angles at Y, X, and V are given as (4x + 15)° and (2x + 65)° respectively.
- Since point X lies on line segments WX and VX, it forms two angles at X.
- We need to find the measure of angle VXY.

**2. DEDUCE SYSTEMATICALLY**
- Since point X is a common vertex for angles at Y and V, we know that the sum of angles at X should equal 180° minus the angle between WX and VX.
- Let's denote the angle between WX and VX as angle Z (since Z is another point on the circle).
- Given that Z = (2x + 65)°, and the other angle at X is (4x + 15)°, we have:
  \[
  \text{Angle at X} = 180^\circ - \text{Angle between WX and VX}
  \]
  Substituting the given values:
  \[
  180^\circ - (4x + 15) = (2x + 65)
  \]

**3. SOLVE THE EQUATION**
- Simplify the equation:
  \[
  180 - 4x - 15 = 2x + 65
  \]
  \[
  165 - 4x = 2x + 65
  \]
  \[
  165 - 65 = 2x + 4x
  \]
  \[
  100 = 6x
  \]
  \[
  x = \frac{100}{6} = \frac{50}{3}
  \]

**4. FIND THE ANGLE VXW**
- Substitute \( x = \frac{50}{3} \) into the expression for angle VXW:
  \[
  \text{Angle VXW} = (2x + 65) = (2 \times \frac{50}{3} + 65) = \frac{100}{3} + 65 = \frac{100 + 200}{3} = \frac{300}{3} = 100
  \]

**5. SELECT THE FINAL ANSWER**
- The angle VXW is 100 degrees.
