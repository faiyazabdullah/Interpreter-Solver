QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Let's start by analyzing the given information:

- Triangle ABC is right-angled at B.
- Line AB = 15
- ∠ACB = 60°
- We need to find the length of line AC, which is denoted as \(x\).

Since angle ACB is 60°, triangle ABC is a 30-60-90 triangle. In such triangles, the side opposite the 30° angle is half the hypotenuse. Therefore, line AC (the side opposite the 60° angle) is half of line BC (the hypotenuse). 

Now, we can use trigonometric ratios to find the length of line AC. Since angle ACB is 60°, the sine of 60° is equal to the opposite side (line AC) divided by the hypotenuse (line BC). 

Therefore:
\[ \sin(60^\circ) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{x}{y} \]
\[ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{x}{y} \]

However, we don't have the length of line BC yet. But since we know the length of line AB (which is 15), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of line BC. 

In a 30-60-90 triangle, the relationship between the sides is:
\[ \text{side opposite 30°} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{hypotenuse} \]
\[ \text{side opposite 60°} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times \text{hypotenuse} \]

So,
\[ \text{AB} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{BC} \]
\[ 15 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{BC} \]
\[ \text{BC} = 30 \]

Now, using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ \text{AC}^2 + \text{AB}^2 = \text{BC}^2 \]
\[ \text{AC}^2 + 15^2 = 30^2 \]
\[ \text{AC}^2 + 225 = 900 \]
\[ \text{AC}^2 = 675 \]
\[ \text{AC} = \sqrt{675} \]
\[ \text{AC} = \sqrt{225 \times 3} \]
\[ \text{AC} = 15\sqrt{3} \]

Thus, the length of line AC (\(x\)) is \(15\sqrt{3}\).
