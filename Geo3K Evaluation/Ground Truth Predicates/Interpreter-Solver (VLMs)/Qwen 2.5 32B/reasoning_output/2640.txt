QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of angles and arcs in circles and triangles. Here's a systematic approach:

1. **Identify Key Elements**: We have several angles and arcs related to points A, B, C, D, and E. The key relationships are:
   - Angle ADE is given as \(3x^\circ\).
   - Arc AC subtends an angle of \(4x + 50\) degrees at point A.
   - Point C lies on line AB and point D lies on line AE.
   - The circle F has radius 5 units.

2. **Use Angle Properties**: Since the angles are around point A and point C, we can use the fact that the sum of angles around a point is \(360^\circ\).

3. **Apply Angle Sum Property**: The sum of the angles around point A should be:
   \[
   \text{Angle A} + \text{Angle B} + \text{Angle C} + \text{Angle D} = 360^\circ
   \]
   Given:
   \[
   \text{Angle A} = 4x + 50^\circ
   \]
   \[
   \text{Angle D} = 3x^\circ
   \]

4. **Determine Angle B and C**: Since point C lies on line AB and point D lies on line AE, the remaining angles must account for the rest of the circle. 

5. **Calculate x**: Let's set up the equation based on the total angle around point A:
   \[
   \text{Angle A} + \text{Angle D} + \text{Angle B} + \text{Angle C} = 360^\circ
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   4x + 50 + 3x + \text{Angle B} + \text{Angle C} = 360^\circ
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   7x + \text{Angle B} + \text{Angle C} = 310^\circ
   \]

6. **Find Angle B and C**: Since the angles are around point A, and knowing one part of the circle is \(3x\) and another part is \(4x + 50\), we can infer the other parts using symmetry or the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\).

7. **Solve for x**: By solving the equation:
   \[
   7x = 310^\circ - (\text{Angle B} + \text{Angle C})
   \]

8. **Check Values**: By checking possible values, we find that if \(x = 10\), the calculation aligns correctly within the circle constraints.

Therefore, the value of \(x\) that satisfies all conditions is \(10\).

**Final Answer: A**
