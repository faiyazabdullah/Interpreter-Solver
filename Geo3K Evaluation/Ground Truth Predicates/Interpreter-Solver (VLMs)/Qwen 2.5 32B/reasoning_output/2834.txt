QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and apply geometric principles to find the length of line segment \( z \).

Given:
- \( \text{Length of } \text{Line}(A, Y) = 5 \)
- \( \text{Length of } \text{Line}(Y, B) = 14 \)

Since \( \angle AYB \) is a right angle (because \( \text{Perpendicular}(\text{Line}(A, Y), \text{Line}(A, B)) \) implies \( \angle AYB \) is a right angle),
and \( \text{Line}(A, N) \) is perpendicular to \( \text{Line}(A, B) \),
we can infer that \( \text{Line}(N, B) \) is vertical to \( \text{Line}(A, N) \).

Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \( AYB \):
\[ AB^2 = Ay^2 + By^2 \]

We know \( Ay = 5 \) and \( By = 14 \),
so,
\[ AB^2 = 5^2 + 14^2 \]
\[ AB^2 = 25 + 196 \]
\[ AB^2 = 221 \]
\[ AB = \sqrt{221} \]

Now, using the fact that \( z \) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by \( \text{Line}(A, N) \) and \( \text{Line}(B, N) \),
which is essentially another right triangle with legs \( x \) and \( z \),
and knowing that \( AB = \sqrt{221} \) is the hypotenuse,
we have:
\[ \text{Length of } \text{Line}(A, N) = x \]
\[ \text{Length of } \text{Line}(B, N) = z \]

By the Pythagorean theorem again in this triangle:
\[ AB^2 = x^2 + z^2 \]
\[ (\sqrt{221})^2 = x^2 + z^2 \]
\[ 221 = x^2 + z^2 \]

However, since \( x \) is not provided directly, we can only express \( z \) as:
\[ z = \sqrt{221 - x^2} \]

Since we don't have enough information to determine \( x \), we cannot determine the exact value of \( z \) without additional information about \( x \). Therefore, based on the provided data, the value of \( z \) cannot be determined precisely.

Thus, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
