To solve this problem, we need to use the given information and apply geometric principles to find the measure of angle 4.

**Step 1: Analyze the given information**

1. The measure of angle A is given as 123°.
2. Point C lies on line segment CD.
3. Line segment AB is perpendicular to line segment CD at point C.
4. We need to find the measure of angle 4.

**Step 2: Deduce systematically**

Since line segment AB is perpendicular to line segment CD at point C, angle ACB is a right angle, which means it measures 90°.

Given that angle A is 123°, we know that angle ADB is supplementary to angle ACB because they form a linear pair (sum up to 180°).

So, angle ADB = 180° - angle A = 180° - 123° = 57°.

Since angle 4 is equal to angle ADB by the given predicate:

∠4 = ∠ADB = 57°

**Step 3: Conclude and select**

Therefore, the measure of angle 4 is 57°.
