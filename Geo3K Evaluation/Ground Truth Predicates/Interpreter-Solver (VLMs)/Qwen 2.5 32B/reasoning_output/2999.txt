QUESTION:
The square is circumscribed to the circle. Find the exact circumference of the circle.

CHOICES:
A. 7 \pi
B. 14 \pi
C. 21 \pi
D. 28 \pi

====================================================================================================
To find the circumference of the circle, let's first identify some key properties and relationships based on the given information:

1. **Square Circumscribed to Circle**: This means that the circle is inscribed in the square, and its diameter is equal to the side length of the square. Since the length of the side of the square is 14 yards, the diameter of the circle is also 14 yards.

2. **Circle Diameter**: The diameter of the circle is 14 yards. Therefore, the radius \( r \) of the circle is half the diameter, which is \( r = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) yards.

3. **Circumference Calculation**: The formula for the circumference \( C \) of a circle is given by \( C = 2\pi r \). Substituting the value of the radius, we get:
   \[
   C = 2\pi \times 7 = 14\pi
   \]

So, the exact circumference of the circle is \( 14\pi \).

**Final Answer: B**
