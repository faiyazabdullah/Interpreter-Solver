QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to use the fact that parallel lines have equal corresponding angles. Given the configuration of points and angles, we can deduce the following relationships:

1. Since \(m \parallel n\), \(\angle ABE = \angle UEC\) and \(\angle ABE = \angle UEC\) because they are corresponding angles formed by transversals \(AC\) and \(BC\) intersecting lines \(m\) and \(n\) respectively.

2. The measure of \(\angle ABE\) can be expressed as either \(4x-23^\circ\) or \(2x+17^\circ\) depending on which side of the intersection it is measured from.

3. Setting these measures equal gives us the equation:
\[ 4x - 23 = 2x + 17 \]

4. Solving this equation will give us the value of \(x\):
\[ 4x - 2x = 17 + 23 \]
\[ 2x = 40 \]
\[ x = 20 \]

Thus, the correct answer is B.
