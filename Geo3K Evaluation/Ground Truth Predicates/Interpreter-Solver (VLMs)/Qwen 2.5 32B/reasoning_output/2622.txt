QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use the information provided about the area of the blue quadrilateral and the dimensions of the green parallelogram. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identify Key Elements:**
   - We have a blue quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with an area of 36 square yards (\(A = 36 \text{ yd}^2\)).
   - There is a green parallelogram inside the blue quadrilateral with a base of 4 yards (\(EFGH = 4 \text{ yd}\)).

2. **Deduce Systematically:**
   - The height of the blue quadrilateral can be determined using the formula for the area of a quadrilateral (which we assume here as a parallelogram since it shares the same base and height as the green parallelogram). However, since we don't have explicit height information, we use the area directly to infer heights.
   - Since the blue quadrilateral has an area of 36 square yards and the green parallelogram is inside it with a base of 4 yards, we can deduce the height of the green parallelogram by considering its relationship to the blue quadrilateral.

3. **Combine Predicates:**
   - Let's denote the height of the green parallelogram as \(h\).
   - The area of the green parallelogram is given by the base times the height, i.e., \(4 \times h\).

4. **Final Conclusion:**
   - Since the blue quadrilateral's area includes the green parallelogram, the area of the green parallelogram is part of the total area calculation but needs to be scaled up proportionally to fit into the blue figure.
   - Given the options and knowing that the area of the parallelogram is directly proportional to the height of the parallelogram relative to the base, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Area of Green Parallelogram} = \frac{4}{8} \times 36 = \frac{1}{2} \times 36 = 18 \text{ yd}^2
     \]
   - Therefore, the area of the green parallelogram is 18 square yards.
