To solve this problem, let's analyze the geometric configuration step by step:

1. **Identify Key Elements:**
   - We have a regular pentagon \(ABCDE\) and a square \(XYZW\) where \(X\) is a mutual vertex.
   - The sides \(XY\) and \(XZ\) are sides of a third regular polygon with a vertex at \(X\).

2. **Deduction Systematically:**
   - Since \(X\) is a vertex of both the pentagon and the square, we need to determine how these configurations relate to a third regular polygon.
   - The vertices of the pentagon are \(A, B, C, D,\) and \(E\).
   - The vertices of the square are \(X, Y, Z,\) and \(W\).
   - The side length of the pentagon is equal to the side length of the square (since they share a vertex and form a right angle there).

3. **Formulate the Logical Chain:**
   - From the regular polygon condition and the fact that \(XY\) and \(XZ\) are sides of a regular polygon, we can infer that the third polygon must be formed by connecting vertices around \(X\) such that it forms a closed loop.
   - Each side of the polygon corresponds to the side lengths of the pentagon and the square.
   - The total number of sides of the polygon is calculated by adding the sides of the pentagon and the square and then accounting for the overlapping vertex \(X\).

4. **Calculate the Total Number of Sides:**
   - The pentagon has 5 sides.
   - The square has 4 sides.
   - Since the polygon shares a vertex \(X\) with both shapes, the count needs to subtract one side from the sum to avoid double-counting.

5. **Combine Multiple Predicates:**
   - Total sides = Sides of pentagon + Sides of square - Overlapping vertex.
   - Total sides = 5 (pentagon) + 4 (square) - 1 (overlapping vertex).
   - Total sides = 8.

6. **Final Conclusion and Selection:**
   - The total number of sides of the polygon is 8, but since we are looking for the number of sides of a regular polygon that matches this configuration, we need to consider the options provided.

7. **Select the Correct Option:**
   - Given the options, the closest match is likely to be either 14 or 28 based on the structure described.

Therefore, the correct answer should be:
