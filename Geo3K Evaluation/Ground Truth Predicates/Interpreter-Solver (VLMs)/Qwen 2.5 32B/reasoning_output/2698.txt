QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the circle, the congruence of triangles, and the lengths of the sides.

Firstly, let's summarize the information provided:

1. Triangle \(WXY\) is inscribed in a circle, where \(T\) is another point on the circle.
2. The lengths of the sides are given as follows:
   - \(WT = 4x\)
   - \(TW = 2x + 10\)
3. Triangles \(WTY\) and \(TWY\) are congruent by the given condition.
4. Points \(T\), \(X\), and \(Y\) lie on the circle, making them points of intersection with the circle.

Since the triangles \(WTY\) and \(TWY\) are congruent, their corresponding sides must be equal. Therefore, we have:

\[ WT = TW \]

Given that \(WT = 4x\) and \(TW = 2x + 10\), we can set up the equation:

\[ 4x = 2x + 10 \]

Now, let's solve for \(x\):

\[ 4x - 2x = 10 \]
\[ 2x = 10 \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Therefore, the value of \(x\) is 5.
