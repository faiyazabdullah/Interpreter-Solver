To solve this problem, we need to find the scale factor between the two similar rectangles. The scale factor is the ratio of the corresponding dimensions of the two figures. In this case, we will compare the width of the blue rectangle to the width of the green rectangle.

Let's start by finding the width of the blue rectangle. We know its area is 8 square inches and its length is 4 inches. The formula for the area of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

Given:
\[ \text{Area} = 8 \text{ in}^2 \]
\[ \text{length} = 4 \text{ in} \]

We can solve for the width:
\[ 8 = 4 \times \text{width} \]
\[ \text{width} = \frac{8}{4} = 2 \text{ in} \]

Now, let's consider the green rectangle. We know its area is 32 square inches, and one of its sides (let's call it \(x\)) is unknown. Let's denote the width of the green rectangle as \(W\). Since the rectangles are similar, their corresponding side ratios are equal. Therefore, we have:

\[ \frac{\text{width of green rectangle}}{\text{width of blue rectangle}} = \frac{x}{4} \]

We already found the width of the blue rectangle to be 2 inches. So:

\[ \frac{W}{2} = \frac{x}{4} \]

Since we don't have enough information about \(x\) directly, let's use the fact that the areas of the rectangles are proportional to the squares of their corresponding sides. The area of the green rectangle is 32 square inches, and the area of the blue rectangle is 8 square inches. The ratio of the areas is:

\[ \frac{\text{area of green rectangle}}{\text{area of blue rectangle}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4 \]

Since the areas are proportional to the squares of the corresponding sides, we have:

\[ \left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2 = 4 \]

Taking the square root of both sides gives us:

\[ \frac{x}{2} = 2 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

Now, we know the scale factor is the ratio of the corresponding dimensions. Since \(x = 4\) and the width of the blue rectangle is 2, the scale factor is:

\[ \frac{x}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \]

Therefore, the scale factor from the blue figure to the green figure is 2.
