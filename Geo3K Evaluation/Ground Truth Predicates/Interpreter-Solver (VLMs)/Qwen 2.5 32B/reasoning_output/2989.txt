To solve this problem, we need to understand that the two shapes are similar. This means their corresponding sides are proportional. 

Given that the area of quadrilateral ABCD is 400 mm² and the area of the smaller shape EFGH is 64 mm², we can use the relationship between the areas of similar figures to find the length x of the side of the smaller shape.

The ratio of the areas of two similar figures is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. So, if the area of quadrilateral ABCD is 400 mm² and the area of the smaller shape EFGH is 64 mm², the ratio of their areas is:

\[ \frac{\text{Area of EFGH}}{\text{Area of ABCD}} = \left(\frac{x}{40}\right)^2 \]

Given the area ratio:

\[ \frac{64}{400} = \left(\frac{x}{40}\right)^2 \]

We can solve for \(x\):

\[ \left(\frac{x}{40}\right)^2 = \frac{64}{400} \]

\[ \left(\frac{x}{40}\right)^2 = \frac{16}{100} \]

\[ \left(\frac{x}{40}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{25} \]

Taking the square root of both sides:

\[ \frac{x}{40} = \frac{2}{5} \]

\[ x = \frac{2}{5} \times 40 \]

\[ x = 16 \]

Therefore, the length of x is 16 mm.
