====================================================================================================
Let's start by analyzing the given information and applying it systematically:

1. **Rectangle Analysis**:
   - Since JKLML is a rectangle, the opposite angles are equal, i.e., ∠JMK ≅ ∠KLM.
   - Also, since KLMP is a rhombus, all sides are equal, and opposite angles are equal, i.e., ∠KLM ≅ ∠PML.

2. **Angle Relationships**:
   - We know that ∠JMK ≅ ∠RMP and ∠JMK = 55°.
   - Therefore, ∠RMP = 55°.

3. **Finding ∠KML**:
   - From the properties of a rhombus, ∠KLM ≅ ∠PML.
   - Since ∠KLM and ∠PML are adjacent angles formed by the intersection of the diagonals of the rhombus, they add up to 180°.

4. **Using Given Angles**:
   - Let’s denote the angle between KL and ML as ∠KLM = x.
   - Then, ∠PML = 180° - x because ∠KLM and ∠PML are supplementary angles in the rhombus.
   - Since ∠RMP = 55°, we can deduce that ∠PML = 70° (because ∠RMP = 70°).

5. **Solving for x**:
   - Therefore, 180° - x = 70°.
   - Solving this, we get x = 180° - 70° = 110°.

Thus, ∠KML = 110°.
