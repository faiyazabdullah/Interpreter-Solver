QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Let's analyze the given geometric figure:

1. **Identify Key Elements**: 
   - Square \(ABCD\) is inscribed in circle \(\odot K\).
   - Points \(G\) lies on line \(CD\), and \(CG\) is perpendicular to \(CD\).
   - Point \(F\) lies on circle \(\odot F\) with radius 3 units, which is centered at point \(F\).
   - Line \(G\) is perpendicular to \(CD\).

2. **Question Analysis**:
   - We need to find the measure of a central angle.

3. **Systematic Deduction**:
   - Since \(ABCD\) is a square inscribed in \(\odot K\), the diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle.
   - Let's denote the side length of the square as \(s\). Therefore, the diagonal \(d = s\sqrt{2}\) equals the diameter of the circle, which means the radius of the circle is half of the diagonal.
   - This implies the center of the square, which we'll call \(O\), is also the center of the circle \(\odot K\).
   - Since \(O\) is the center of both squares and circles, the central angle subtended by a side of the square (which is a quarter of the circle) can be determined by considering the properties of the circle and the square.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Each central angle in a circle divided into four equal parts corresponds to a right angle (90 degrees) because the central angle is one-fourth of the circleâ€™s total 360 degrees.

Thus, the measure of each central angle is \(90\) degrees.
