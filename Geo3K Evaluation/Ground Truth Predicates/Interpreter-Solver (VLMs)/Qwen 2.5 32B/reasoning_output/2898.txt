====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given geometric figure and use the provided information to find the area of the figure. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Key Elements and Relationships:**
   - The figure consists of two circles, one inside the other, with radii \( r \) and \( R \) respectively.
   - The smaller circle is centered at point \( A \) and has radius \( r \).
   - The larger circle is centered at point \( B \) and has radius \( R \).
   - The distance between the centers \( A \) and \( B \) is \( 8 \).
   - The length of the line segment \( GH \) is \( 3 \), where \( G \) lies on the circumference of the smaller circle and \( H \) lies on the circumference of the larger circle.

2. **Use the Perpendicularity Condition:**
   - The line segment \( GH \) is perpendicular to the line segment \( CH \). This implies that \( GH \) is a vertical line segment from the center of the smaller circle to the circumference of the larger circle.

3. **Calculate the Radii:**
   - Since \( GH \) is a vertical line segment from the center of the smaller circle to the circumference of the larger circle, the distance from the center of the smaller circle to the circumference of the larger circle is the difference between the radius of the larger circle and the radius of the smaller circle. This distance is also equal to the height of the right triangle formed by the radius of the smaller circle, the radius of the larger circle, and the line segment connecting their centers.

4. **Formulate the Right Triangle:**
   - Let \( r \) be the radius of the smaller circle and \( R \) be the radius of the larger circle.
   - The distance between the centers is \( 8 \), so \( R - r = 3 \).

5. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   - The right triangle formed has legs \( R - r \) and \( r \), and hypotenuse \( R \). Using the Pythagorean theorem:
     \[
     (R - r)^2 + r^2 = R^2
     \]
   - Substitute \( R - r = 3 \):
     \[
     3^2 + r^2 = R^2 \implies 9 + r^2 = R^2
     \]

6. **Find the Area of the Figure:**
   - The area of the figure is the sum of the areas of the two circles minus the area of the rectangle formed by the difference in radii and the horizontal distance between the centers.
   - The area of the smaller circle is \( \pi r^2 \).
   - The area of the larger circle is \( \pi R^2 \).
   - The area of the rectangle is \( 8 \times (R - r) = 8 \times 3 = 24 \).

7. **Calculate the Final Answer:**
   - The total area is \( \pi R^2 + \pi r^2 - 24 \).
   - Substitute \( R^2 = 9 + r^2 \):
     \[
     \pi R^2 = \pi (9 + r^2)
     \]
   - Therefore, the total area is:
     \[
     \pi (9 + r^2) + \pi r^2 - 24 = \pi (9 + 2r^2) - 24
     \]
   - To find the numerical value, we need to determine \( r \). Given \( R - r = 3 \), we can solve for \( r \) using the Pythagorean relationship. Let \( x = r \), then \( R = 3 + x \):
     \[
     (3 + x)^2 + x^2 = R^2 \implies 9 + 6x + x^2 + x^2 = 9 + 6x + 2x^2 - 24 = 0
     \]
     Solving this quadratic equation gives \( x = 2 \), so \( r = 2 \) and \( R = 5 \).

8. **Final Calculation:**
   - The area of the smaller circle is \( \pi (2)^2 = 4\pi \).
   - The area of the larger circle is \( \pi (5)^2 = 25\pi \).
   - The area of the rectangle is \( 8 \times 3 = 24 \).
   - The total area is:
     \[
     25\pi + 4\pi - 24 = 29\pi - 24 \approx 29 \times 3.1416 - 24 \approx 81.1 - 24 = 57.1
     \]
   - The closest option is \( B \).
