QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Identify key elements:**
   - We have a parallelogram \(ABCD\) with \(AB\) parallel to \(CD\) and \(AD\) parallel to \(BC\).
   - \(AB = CD\) and \(AD = BC\).
   - \(BD\) is a diagonal of the parallelogram.
   - \(\angle ADB = 90^\circ\) and \(\angle BDA = 90^\circ\), which means \(BD\) is perpendicular to both \(AD\) and \(AB\).

2. **Use the properties of parallelograms:**
   - Since \(AB\) is parallel to \(CD\) and \(AD\) is parallel to \(BC\), we can use the fact that opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal.
   - Since \(BD\) is perpendicular to \(AD\) and \(AB\), triangle \(ABD\) is a right triangle with \(\angle ADB = 90^\circ\).

3. **Determine the lengths:**
   - Given \(AD = 10\) meters and \(\angle ADB = 90^\circ\), we know that \(BD\) is the height of the parallelogram when considering \(AD\) as the base.
   - Since \(\angle BDA = 90^\circ\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \(ABD\) to find \(AB\).

4. **Calculate the area of the parallelogram:**
   - The area of a parallelogram is given by the product of the base and the height.
   - Here, \(AD\) is the base, and \(BD\) is the height.

Since \(BD\) is the height of the parallelogram and it forms a right triangle with \(AB\) and \(AD\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find \(AB\).

5. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem:**
   - Let \(AB = x\). Then, in triangle \(ABD\):
     \[
     AB^2 + BD^2 = AD^2
     \]
     \[
     x^2 + 6^2 = 10^2
     \]
     \[
     x^2 + 36 = 100
     \]
     \[
     x^2 = 64
     \]
     \[
     x = 8
     \]

6. **Calculate the area:**
   - The base \(AD = 10\) meters.
   - The height \(BD = 6\) meters.
   - Therefore, the area of the parallelogram is:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{base} \times \text{height} = 10 \times 6 = 60 \text{ square meters}
     \]

7. **Select the closest option:**
   - The closest option to 60 square meters is option D.
