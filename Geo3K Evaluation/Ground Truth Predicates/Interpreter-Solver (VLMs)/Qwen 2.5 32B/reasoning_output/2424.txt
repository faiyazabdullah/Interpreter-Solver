QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**1. ANALYZE & EXTRACT**
- From the given information, we know that ∠AGC = 60°, and point G lies on lines AC, AD, and BC. We also have points E and D on circles centered at G with radius 0.
- Since G lies on line AC and AC is a chord of circle E, we can use the inscribed angle theorem which states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

**2. DEDUCE SYSTEMATICALLY**
- Since ∠AGC = 60°, and G is on the circumference of circle E, ∠AGE = 60° because it intercepts the same arc as ∠AGC but is formed by two tangents from G to circle E.
- Since E is on circle G, ∠EGD = 60° because it forms a tangent from G to circle G.
- Since D is on circle G and G is on the circumference of circle E, ∠DEG = 120° because the sum of the angles around point G is 360°, and ∠AGE = 60° means ∠DEG = 360° - 60° - 60° - 60° = 120°.

**3. CONCLUDE & SELECT**
- Therefore, ∠BGD = ∠DEG = 120° because they subtend the same arc in their respective circles.
