To solve this problem, let's analyze the given geometric figure and use the provided information to find the length of \(\widehat{JK}\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Key Elements:**
   - We have a circle with center \(C\).
   - Points \(J\) and \(K\) lie on the circle such that \(JK\) is an arc.
   - The measure of \(\angle KCJ = 30^\circ\).
   - The length of segment \(KC = 2\) feet.

2. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length of arc \(\widehat{JK}\), which subtends the angle \(30^\circ\) at the center \(C\).

3. **Use the Formula for Arc Length:**
   - The formula for the length of an arc \(\widehat{AB}\) subtending an angle \(\theta\) radians in a circle of radius \(r\) is:
     \[
     \text{Arc length} = r \times \theta
     \]
   - First, convert the angle from degrees to radians:
     \[
     \theta = \frac{\pi}{180} \times 30^\circ = \frac{\pi}{6}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Radius:**
   - We know \(KC = 2\) feet, but we need to find the radius \(r\). Since \(KC\) is a radius, \(r = 2\) feet.

5. **Substitute Values into the Arc Length Formula:**
   - Using \(r = 2\) feet and \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{6}\):
     \[
     \text{Arc length} = 2 \times \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{2\pi}{6} = \frac{\pi}{3}
     \]

6. **Approximate Value:**
   - The value of \(\pi\) is approximately 3.14159.
   - Therefore,
     \[
     \frac{\pi}{3} \approx \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.047
     \]

7. **Round to Nearest Hundredth:**
   - The length of \(\widehat{JK}\) rounded to the nearest hundredth is approximately 1.05 feet.

### Conclusion:

Therefore, the length of \(\widehat{JK}\) is approximately 1.05 feet.

**Final Answer:** C
