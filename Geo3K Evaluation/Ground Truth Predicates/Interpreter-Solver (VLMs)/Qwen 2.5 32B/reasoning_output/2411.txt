Let's analyze the given problem step by step.

1. **Identify key elements:**
   - There are three points labeled A, B, and C.
   - Points B lies on two circles: one with center A and radius \( r_0 \), and another with center C and radius \( r_2 \).
   - The distance between points B and C is 20 units.

2. **Question to find:**
   - The area of the shaded region.

3. **Critical measurements and special constructions:**
   - The shaded region is the area inside the larger circle but outside the smaller circle.

4. **Step-by-step solution:**
   - Let the radius of the larger circle be \( R \).
   - The radius of the smaller circle is \( r_2 = 20 \).

5. **Using the properties of circles:**
   - Since B lies on both circles, we can use the fact that the distance between the centers (A and C) and the point B forms a right triangle with the radii of the circles.

6. **Formulate the equation:**
   - The distance between A and C is \( \sqrt{(r_0)^2 + (20)^2} \).
   - This distance is equal to \( R \) because the larger circle includes both smaller circles.

7. **Calculate the radius of the larger circle:**
   - Let \( r_0 = x \).
   - Then \( R = \sqrt{(x)^2 + (20)^2} \).

8. **Area of the shaded region:**
   - The area of the shaded region is the area of the larger circle minus the area of the smaller circle.
   - Area of larger circle = \( \pi R^2 \)
   - Area of smaller circle = \( \pi r_2^2 \)

9. **Substitute \( R \) in terms of \( x \):**
   - \( R = \sqrt{x^2 + 400} \)
   - Area of shaded region = \( \pi (\sqrt{x^2 + 400})^2 - \pi (20)^2 \)
   - Simplify: \( \pi (x^2 + 400) - 400\pi \)

10. **Solve for \( x \) using the Pythagorean theorem:**
    - Since B lies on both circles, \( x = 20 \) (the distance between A and C is the same as the diameter of the smaller circle).

11. **Substitute \( x = 20 \) into the equation:**
    - \( R = \sqrt{(20)^2 + (20)^2} = \sqrt{800} = 20\sqrt{2} \)

12. **Calculate the area of the shaded region:**
    - Area of shaded region = \( \pi (20\sqrt{2})^2 - 400\pi \)
    - Simplify: \( \pi (800) - 400\pi = 400\pi \)

13. **Approximate value:**
    - \( \pi \approx 3.14 \)
    - \( 400\pi \approx 400 \times 3.14 = 1256 \)

14. **Round to the nearest tenth:**
    - \( 1256 \) rounded to the nearest tenth is approximately 1256.0

Since this value is not listed among the choices, it seems there might have been an error in the problem statement or the provided options. However, based on the closest available option:
