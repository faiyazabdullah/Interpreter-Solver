**BEGIN ANALYSIS**

1. **Analyze and Extract Key Elements**:
   - Trapezoid QRS T
   - A is midpoint of leg TS
   - B is midpoint of leg QR
   - Length of TS = 12
   - Length of QR = 20
   - Measure of angle SQT = 120°
   - Measure of angle QSR = 45°
   - Points Q, A, and T lie on a straight line
   - Points S, B, and R lie on a straight line

2. **Deduce Systematically**:
   - Since A and B are midpoints, AB is parallel to QT and SR because midsegments of triangles formed by the trapezoid's non-parallel sides are parallel to each other.
   - Using the properties of trapezoids and midpoints:
     - Since AB is parallel to QT and SR, we know that ∠QAR = ∠TQS = 180° - 120° = 60° due to the linear pair property.
     - Since B is midpoint of QR and AB is parallel to SR, ∠SBR = ∠RBS = 45° due to the alternate interior angles theorem when considering the parallel lines and the given angles.

3. **Combine Predicates to Reveal New Relationships**:
   - From the above deductions, we can conclude that ∠SBR = ∠RBS = 45° because they are equal due to the trapezoid's symmetrical properties and the given angles.

4. **Conclude and Select**:
   - Given that ∠SBR = 45° and knowing that ∠SBR is part of the trapezoid’s internal structure along with the given angles, the measure of ∠S must be calculated based on the internal structure and symmetry of the trapezoid.

Therefore, based on the symmetry and properties of trapezoids with midpoints and given angles, the measure of ∠S is 45°.
