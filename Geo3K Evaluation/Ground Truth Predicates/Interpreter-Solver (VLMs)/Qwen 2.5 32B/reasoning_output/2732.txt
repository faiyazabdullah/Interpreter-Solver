To solve the problem, we need to find the length of the side of the square inscribed in a circle with a radius of 6 inches. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify Key Elements:**
   - The square is inscribed in a circle, so the diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle.
   - The radius of the circle is given as 6 inches, so the diameter (which is also the diagonal of the square) is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) inches.

2. **Relate Diagonal to Side Length:**
   - Let the side length of the square be \(s\). The diagonal of the square can be expressed using the Pythagorean theorem: \(\sqrt{s^2 + s^2} = \sqrt{2s^2} = s\sqrt{2}\).
   - Since the diagonal is equal to the diameter of the circle, we have \(s\sqrt{2} = 12\).

3. **Solve for Side Length:**
   - To find \(s\), divide both sides by \(\sqrt{2}\): \(s = \frac{12}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{12\sqrt{2}}{2} = 6\sqrt{2}\).

So, the length of the side of the square is \(6\sqrt{2}\) inches.

**Final Answer:** C
