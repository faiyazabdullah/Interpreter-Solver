QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Let's start by analyzing the given information and the geometry of the problem.

Given:
1. \( \angle HJL = 116^\circ \)
2. \( H \) lies on line \( HK \)
3. \( J \) lies on line \( JK \)
4. \( K \) lies on circle \( C \) with radius 6
5. \( L \) lies on circle \( C \) with radius 6

We need to find the measure of \( \widehat{JKL} \).

### Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Identify Key Angles:**
   - \( \angle HJL = 116^\circ \)

2. **Understand the Circle Properties:**
   - Both \( J \) and \( K \) lie on the circle with center \( C \) and radius 6.
   - This means \( \angle CKJ = 2 \times \text{arc}(JK) = 2 \times 60^\circ = 120^\circ \) because the central angle subtending the same arc as an inscribed angle is twice the inscribed angle.

3. **Relate Central and Inscribed Angles:**
   - Since \( \angle HJL = 116^\circ \), it is an exterior angle to the inscribed triangle formed by \( J, K, \) and \( L \).
   - The angle at \( K \) in the inscribed triangle will be supplementary to \( \angle HJL \):
     \[
     \angle HKJ = 180^\circ - 116^\circ = 64^\circ
     \]

4. **Calculate \( \widehat{JKL} \):**
   - The inscribed angle \( \angle HKJ \) subtends the same arc \( HK \) as the central angle \( \angle CKJ = 120^\circ \).
   - Therefore, the inscribed angle \( \angle HKJ \) is half of the central angle \( \angle CKJ \):
     \[
     \angle HKJ = \frac{1}{2} \times 120^\circ = 60^\circ
     \]
   - Thus, \( \widehat{JKL} = 2 \times \angle HKJ = 2 \times 64^\circ = 128^\circ \).

However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the provided options. Given the correct calculation, we should select the closest option to our derived result.

Since the options provided do not match our calculated value, let's re-examine if any misinterpretation exists.

Upon reviewing the options again, none seem directly correct based on the calculation. 

Revisiting the problem setup might reveal an alternative interpretation or oversight. If this remains unresolved, let's choose the closest option among those provided.

Given the discrepancy between the problem statement and the calculated values, the closest option appears to be:
