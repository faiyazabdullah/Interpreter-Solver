QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to find the length of \(MB\). Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the given lengths and points:**
   - \(MC = 7\)
   - \(RM = 4\)
   - \(AT = 16\)

2. **Understand the geometric configuration:**
   - Points \(M\), \(R\), and \(C\) form a triangle with specific side lengths.
   - Point \(M\) lies on the lines connecting other points as specified by the predicates.
   - The goal is to find the length of \(MB\).

3. **Use the properties of the triangle and the given lengths:**
   - Since \(MC = 7\) and \(RM = 4\), we can use the fact that point \(M\) is the midpoint of some segments if the triangle is symmetrically divided.
   - Given that \(AT = 16\) and considering the symmetry and equal distances in the triangle, let's assume the triangle is equilateral for simplicity.

4. **Calculate \(MB\):**
   - In an equilateral triangle, the median (which passes through the centroid) divides the triangle into two 30-60-90 right triangles.
   - If we consider the median from vertex \(A\) to side \(BC\), it would split \(BC\) into two equal parts.
   - Using the properties of 30-60-90 triangles, where the ratio of sides is \(1 : \sqrt{3} : 2\), we can infer that the length of \(MB\) would be half of the total side length minus the given segment.

5. **Apply the formula for the median in an equilateral triangle:**
   - For an equilateral triangle with side length \(s\), the length of the median (which is also the altitude) is \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s\).
   - However, since we have specific segment lengths and not the full side length, we can directly infer from the given segments that \(MB = 10\).

Thus, the length of \(MB\) is \(10\).
