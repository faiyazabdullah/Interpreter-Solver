QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**1. ANALYZE & EXTRACT**
- The problem involves angles at a circle where the measures of angles \( \angle ABD \), \( \angle BAC \), \( \angle ACD \), and \( \angle BCD \) are given as expressions involving \( y \) and \( x \).
- The measure of \( \angle BAC = 58^\circ \).

**2. DEDUCE SYSTEMATICALLY**
- From the circle theorem, the sum of opposite angles subtended by the same arc is supplementary. Therefore, \( \angle BAC + \angle BDC = 180^\circ \). 
- Given \( \angle BAC = 58^\circ \), then \( \angle BDC = 180^\circ - 58^\circ = 122^\circ \).
- Since \( \angle BDC = 2x \), we have \( 2x = 122^\circ \). Solving for \( x \):
  \[
  x = \frac{122}{2} = 61^\circ
  \]

**CONCLUDE & SELECT**
- The value of \( \angle BCD \) is \( 2x \), which is \( 122^\circ \).
- However, the question asks for \( m \angle D \). Given the choices, it appears there might be a discrepancy since the calculated angle should be \( 122^\circ \), but the choices provided do not include this value.
- Given the options, the closest value to \( 122^\circ \) among the choices is \( 120^\circ \), which suggests a potential error in the problem setup or choices provided.

Since none of the given choices match the calculated angle of \( 122^\circ \), let's re-evaluate the possible choices:
