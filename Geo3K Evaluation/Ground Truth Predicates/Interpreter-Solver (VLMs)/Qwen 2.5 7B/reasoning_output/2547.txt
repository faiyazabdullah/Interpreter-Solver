QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To find the value of \(x\) in the given geometric figure, we need to use the properties of tangents and the fact that they are equal from a point outside a circle.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Tangent Lengths:**
   - We know that the tangent segments from a common external point to a circle are equal.
   - Therefore, the lengths \(QT = QV\), \(RT = RS\), and \(ST = SV\).

2. **Express the Given Lengths:**
   - \(QT = 2x\)
   - \(RS = 27\) inches
   - Since \(T\) divides \(QS\) into two segments, and knowing that \(QS = QT + TS = 2x + TS\), and since \(TS\) is also part of the total length \(QS\), we can infer the relationship using the tangent lengths property.

3. **Apply the Tangent Length Property:**
   - From the figure, the length \(TS = 17\) inches.
   - Since \(QT = QV = 14\) inches, we need to consider the total length involving \(Q, T,\) and \(S\).

4. **Calculate Total Length Using Tangent Property:**
   - Since \(QT = 2x\) and \(TS = 17\), we have:
     \[
     QS = QT + TS = 2x + 17
     \]
   - Given \(RS = 27\), and knowing the tangents from \(Q\) to the circle, we equate:
     \[
     2x + 17 = 27
     \]

5. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   2x + 17 = 27
   \]
   \[
   2x = 27 - 17
   \]
   \[
   2x = 10
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{10}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

Thus, the value of \(x\) is \(5\).
