To solve this problem, let's analyze the given information and derive the length of the side of the square:

1. **Identify the Key Elements:**
   - We have a square inscribed in a circle.
   - The radius of the circle is 6 inches.
   - The diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle because the diagonal of the square spans the diameter of the circle.

2. **Calculate the Diagonal of the Square:**
   - Since the circle's radius is 6 inches, its diameter is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) inches.
   - Therefore, the diagonal of the square is 12 inches.

3. **Relate the Diagonal to the Side Length:**
   - Let the side length of the square be \(s\).
   - The relationship between the side length and the diagonal of a square is given by the Pythagorean theorem for a right triangle formed by two sides and the diagonal.
   - If we consider the square's diagonal as the hypotenuse of a right triangle, then:
     \[
     \text{Diagonal}^2 = s^2 + s^2 = 2s^2
     \]
   - Given that the diagonal is 12 inches:
     \[
     12^2 = 2s^2
     \]
     \[
     144 = 2s^2
     \]
     \[
     s^2 = \frac{144}{2} = 72
     \]
     \[
     s = \sqrt{72} = \sqrt{36 \times 2} = 6\sqrt{2}
     \]

Thus, the length of the side of the square is \(6\sqrt{2}\).
