**1. ANALYZE & EXTRACT**
- We have a circle centered at point A with points G, H, K, and J lying on the circumference.
- The measure of angle A, L, H is given as 110 degrees.
- The measure of angle J, A, K is given as 97 degrees.
- We need to find the measure of angle G, A, H, which we denote as \(x\).

**2. DEDUCE SYSTEMATICALLY**
- Since A, L, H form a triangle, we know that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
- Therefore, angle A, L, H + angle A, H, L = 180 degrees. Since angle A, L, H = 110 degrees, angle A, H, L = 180 - 110 = 70 degrees.
- Similarly, angle J, A, K + angle J, K, A = 180 degrees. Since angle J, A, K = 97 degrees, angle J, K, A = 180 - 97 = 83 degrees.
- Since G, A, H forms a triangle with A, L, H and A, H, L, and G, A, H forms another triangle with J, A, K and J, K, A, we can use the fact that the sum of angles around point A in the circle is 360 degrees.
- The total angle subtended by arc GKJH at the center is 360 degrees minus the known angles. However, we can directly use the properties of the circle and the given angles to find \(x\).
- By the inscribed angle theorem, angle G, A, H is supplementary to the angle J, K, A because they subtend the same arc GH. Therefore, angle G, A, H = 180 - 83 = 97 degrees.

**3. CONCLUDE & SELECT**
- The measure of angle G, A, H is 97 degrees.
- Therefore, the correct choice is B.

Final Answer: B
