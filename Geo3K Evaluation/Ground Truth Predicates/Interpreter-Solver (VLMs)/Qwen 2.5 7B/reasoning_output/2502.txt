QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**1. ANALYZE & EXTRACT**
- The angle at point C is a right angle, meaning it measures 90 degrees.
- Angle DAB is given as 123 degrees.
- Point A lies on line segment CD, indicating that line segments AC and AB form a triangle with angle CAD being part of angle DAB.

**2. DEDUCE SYSTEMATICALLY**
- Since angle DAB = 123 degrees, and point A lies on line segment CD, angle CAD can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Angle CAD} = \text{Angle DAB} - \text{Angle ABC} \]
- To find angle ABC, we know that in triangle ABC, the sum of the interior angles is always 180 degrees:
\[ \text{Angle ABC} = 180^\circ - 90^\circ - \text{Angle BAC} \]
Since angle BAC is part of the larger angle DAB, which is split by the right angle at C, we need to find the remaining angle in triangle ABC. 

**3. CONCLUDE & SELECT**
- Given the constraints, the angle at B is effectively part of a supplementary relationship with the angle at D.
- By subtracting the right angle and the known angle at D from 180 degrees, we can deduce the measure of angle ABC:
\[ \text{Angle ABC} = 180^\circ - 90^\circ - (\text{Angle DAB} - \text{Angle CAD}) \]

Given the options, the only feasible solution based on the given angle and relationships is:
