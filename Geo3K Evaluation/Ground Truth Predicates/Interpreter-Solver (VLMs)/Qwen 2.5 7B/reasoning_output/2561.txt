To find the area of the given figure, we need to understand its structure and identify the appropriate shape and dimensions.

1. **Identify the Shape**: The figure appears to be a quadrilateral with some specific properties. We know the lengths of two sides and the diagonals, and we have information about perpendiculars. This suggests a possible decomposition into simpler shapes.

2. **Break Down the Figure**: Let's consider the figure as a combination of a rectangle and a right triangle.

   - The rectangle part has sides \(AD = 5\) m and \(DE = 6\) m.
   - There is a diagonal \(AC\) which is equal to \(4\) m, and another diagonal \(BD\) also equal to \(4\) m.

3. **Calculate the Area of Rectangle \(ADEB\)**:
   - The area of rectangle \(ADEB\) is calculated by multiplying the lengths of its sides:
     \[
     \text{Area}_{\text{rectangle}} = AD \times DE = 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ square meters}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Area of Triangle \(ABC\)**:
   - Since \(AC\) and \(BD\) are diagonals and equal in length, they intersect at point \(C\). This means \(C\) divides the diagonals into two equal parts. Therefore, \(C\) is the midpoint of both diagonals.
   - Given that \(AC = BD = 4\) m, and considering the right triangles formed, we can see that the area of triangle \(ABC\) is half the area of the rectangle since it occupies half the area due to the perpendicularity and symmetry.

5. **Calculate the Total Area**:
   - The total area of the figure is the sum of the areas of the rectangle and the triangle:
     \[
     \text{Total Area} = \text{Area}_{\text{rectangle}} + \text{Area}_{\text{triangle}}
     \]
     - The area of triangle \(ABC\) is half of the rectangle's area:
       \[
       \text{Area}_{\text{triangle}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ square meters}
       \]
     - Therefore, the total area is:
       \[
       \text{Total Area} = 30 + 15 = 45 \text{ square meters}
       \]

However, this calculation seems incorrect based on the provided choices. Let's reconsider the problem with the correct interpretation:

Given the perpendicular relationships and the lengths, the figure can be seen as a trapezoid with a height of \(4\) m and bases \(5\) m and \(6\) m.

The area of a trapezoid is given by:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{Base}_1 + \text{Base}_2) \times \text{Height}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (5 + 6) \times 4 = \frac{1}{2} \times 11 \times 4 = 22 \text{ square meters}
\]

Thus, the correct total area is \(22 \text{ square meters}\).
