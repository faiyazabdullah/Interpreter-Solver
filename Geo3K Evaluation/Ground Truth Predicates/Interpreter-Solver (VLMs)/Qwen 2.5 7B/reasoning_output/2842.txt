====================================================================================================
**1. ANALYZE & EXTRACT**
- The given parallelogram ABCD has specific angle measures and side lengths provided.
- We need to find the measure of angle DAC.
- The angles in the parallelogram sum up correctly as they are supplementary and adjacent.
- From the given, we know angle FAB = 20°, angle FDA = 59°, and angle FBC = 49°.
- Since point F lies on lines CA and DB, it forms triangles with the given angles.

**2. DEDUCE SYSTEMATICALLY**
- In triangle FAB, angle FAB = 20° and angle FDA = 59°.
- Therefore, angle FBA can be calculated using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°.
- Angle FBA = 180° - 20° - 59° = 101°.
- Since angle FBC = 49°, we can deduce that angle FCA = 180° - 101° - 49° = 30°.
- In parallelogram ABCD, opposite angles are equal and consecutive angles are supplementary. Therefore, angle DAC = angle FCA = 30°.

**3. CONCLUDE & SELECT**
- The measure of angle DAC is 30°.
- However, this value does not match any of the provided choices.
- Given the choices, the closest logical deduction based on the provided information is to check if there was a misinterpretation or error in the problem setup or choices.
- Since none of the provided choices match the calculated value, we should re-evaluate the problem constraints or the choices themselves.
- Given the constraints and the closest logical deduction, the answer is closest to:
