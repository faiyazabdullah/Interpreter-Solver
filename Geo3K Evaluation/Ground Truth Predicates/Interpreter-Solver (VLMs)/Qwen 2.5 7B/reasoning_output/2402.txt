**1. ANALYZE & EXTRACT**
- The circle O has a radius of 13 inches.
- The radius OB is perpendicular to the chord CD, which measures 24 inches.
- We need to find the length OX where point X lies on line OB.

**2. DEDUCE SYSTEMATICALLY**
- Since OB is perpendicular to CD, OX is the perpendicular distance from O to the chord CD.
- By the Pythagorean theorem applied to triangle OCD, we can find OC and OD.
- Since O is the center, OC = OD = 13.
- Triangle OCD forms a right triangle with hypotenuse CD = 24, one leg OC = 13, and the other leg being the perpendicular distance OX.

Using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ OC^2 + OX^2 = OD^2 \]
\[ 13^2 + OX^2 = 13^2 \]
\[ 169 + OX^2 = 169 \]
\[ OX^2 = 169 - 169 \]
\[ OX^2 = 169 \]
\[ OX = \sqrt{169} \]
\[ OX = 13 \]

However, this calculation seems incorrect because it assumes OX as a direct segment which isn't accurate here. Let's re-evaluate the geometry:

Since OB is perpendicular to CD, and considering the properties of the circle, the correct approach involves recognizing that the perpendicular distance from O to CD bisects CD into two equal segments. Thus, each segment of CD would be 12 inches, making OX = 5.

Thus:
\[ OX = \sqrt{13^2 - 12^2} \]
\[ OX = \sqrt{169 - 144} \]
\[ OX = \sqrt{25} \]
\[ OX = 5 \]

**3. CONCLUDE & SELECT**
