QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve for \( x \), let's use the power of a point theorem at point \( F \). According to the theorem, the product of the lengths of the segments of one secant line is equal to the product of the lengths of the other secant line.

Given:
- \( AF = x \)
- \( FD = 8 \)
- \( AB = x + 2 \)
- \( BC = 3x \)

Applying the power of a point theorem at point \( F \):
\[ AF \cdot FD = BF \cdot FC \]

Substitute the known values:
\[ x \cdot 8 = (x + 2) \cdot (3x) \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 8x = 3x^2 + 6x \]

Rearrange the equation to standard quadratic form:
\[ 3x^2 + 6x - 8x = 0 \]
\[ 3x^2 - 2x = 0 \]

Factor out \( x \):
\[ x(3x - 2) = 0 \]

This gives us two solutions:
\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{2}{3} \]

Since \( x = 0 \) does not make sense in the context of the problem (as it would imply zero length for some segments), we discard it. Therefore, we have:
\[ x = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667 \]

However, this value is not among the choices provided. Let's re-evaluate the problem setup and choices given:

Upon closer inspection, the problem might involve a different interpretation or there might be an error in the problem statement itself as none of the provided choices match the calculated value. Given the choices, the closest reasonable answer based on the problem constraints and typical problem-solving approach in geometry, we should select:
