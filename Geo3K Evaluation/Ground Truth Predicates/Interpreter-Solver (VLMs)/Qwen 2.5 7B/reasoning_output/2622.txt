QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**1. ANALYZE & EXTRACT**
- The two figures are similar by the given predicates.
- The length of AD is 8 yd.
- The length of EG is 4 yd.
- The area of quadrilateral ABCD is 36 yd².

**2. DEDUCE SYSTEMATICALLY**
- Since the figures are similar, the ratio of their corresponding sides is equal.
- The ratio of the sides can be calculated as follows:
  \[
  \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Length of side in smaller figure}}{\text{Length of side in larger figure}} = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}
  \]
- This means that the smaller figure is scaled down by a factor of 2 compared to the larger figure.
- The area of similar figures scales with the square of the scale factor.
- Therefore, the area of the smaller figure will be:
  \[
  \text{Area of smaller figure} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \times \text{Area of larger figure} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9 \text{ yd}^2
  \]

**3. CONCLUDE & SELECT**
- The area of the green figure is 9 yd².
- The closest option is A.

Final Answer: A
