QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometric properties and relationships given:

1. **Identify the incenter**: The point \( G \) is the incenter of triangle \( ABC \). The incenter is the point where the angle bisectors of a triangle intersect.

2. **Use the fact about the incenter and the perpendicular distances**: In a right triangle formed by the incenter and the sides, the distance from the incenter to the side \( AC \) (which is a leg of the triangle) can be found using the formula involving the semiperimeter and the area of the triangle.

However, a simpler approach involves recognizing that the incenter divides the angle bisector into segments proportional to the adjacent sides.

Given:
- \( BC = 12 \)
- \( AB = 13 \)

Since \( G \) is the incenter, it lies on the angle bisectors. The perpendicular distances from the incenter to the sides of the triangle form right triangles with the inradius and the segments of the sides.

By the Angle Bisector Theorem, the length of the inradius \( EG \) can be calculated using the formula involving the sides of the triangle.

Using the formula for the inradius \( r \):

\[ r = \frac{2 \times \text{Area}}{\text{Perimeter}} \]

But here, the direct calculation based on the given lengths simplifies to finding the length of \( EG \) directly as a segment in the right triangle setup.

By the properties of the incenter and the right triangles formed, the length of \( EG \) can be derived as the height of the smaller right triangle formed by the incenter and the sides of the triangle.

Given the lengths provided and the specific geometric relationships, the length of \( EG \) is found to be 5.
