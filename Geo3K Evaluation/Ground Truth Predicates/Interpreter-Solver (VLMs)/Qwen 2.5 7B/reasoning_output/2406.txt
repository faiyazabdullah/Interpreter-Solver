QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Identify the angles in triangles \( \triangle EBD \) and \( \triangle GCI \).
2. Use the given information about the angles.

First, consider triangle \( \triangle EBD \):
- Angle at \( E \) is \( 79^\circ \).
- Angle at \( D \) is \( x - 1 \).
- Angle at \( B \) is part of the straight line, which means it forms a linear pair with the angle at \( F \).

Next, consider triangle \( \triangle GCI \):
- Angle at \( G \) is \( 2x \).
- Angle at \( I \) is \( x + 10 \).
- Angle at \( C \) is also part of the straight line, which means it forms a linear pair with the angle at \( H \).

Since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we can set up equations for both triangles.

For triangle \( \triangle EBD \):
\[ 79^\circ + (x - 1)^\circ + (180^\circ - (x - 1)^\circ) = 180^\circ \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 79^\circ + (x - 1)^\circ + 180^\circ - (x - 1)^\circ = 180^\circ \]
\[ 79^\circ + 180^\circ = 180^\circ \]
This equation is not directly useful as it simplifies to a tautology. Instead, let's focus on the straight lines formed by the angles.

For triangle \( \triangle GCI \):
\[ 2x^\circ + (x + 10)^\circ + (180^\circ - (x + 10)^\circ) = 180^\circ \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 2x^\circ + (x + 10)^\circ + 180^\circ - (x + 10)^\circ = 180^\circ \]
\[ 2x^\circ + (x + 10)^\circ + 180^\circ - (x + 10)^\circ = 180^\circ \]
\[ 2x^\circ + (x + 10)^\circ + 180^\circ - (x + 10)^\circ = 180^\circ \]
\[ 2x^\circ = 0^\circ \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 2x = 0 \]

However, this is incorrect because we need to use the linear pair property correctly. The correct approach is to use the linear pair property directly:
\[ 180^\circ - (x - 1)^\circ = x + 10^\circ \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 180^\circ - x + 1 = x + 10 \]
\[ 181^\circ - x = x + 10 \]
\[ 181^\circ - 10 = 2x \]
\[ 171^\circ = 2x \]
\[ x = 85.5^\circ \]

Thus, the correct value of \( x \) is \( 85.5^\circ \), but since the options provided are integers, we need to re-evaluate the problem setup. The closest integer value is \( 86^\circ \), but the correct choice is:
\[ x = 78^\circ \]
