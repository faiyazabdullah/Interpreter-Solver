====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given kite and the lengths provided. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Identify the properties of the kite**: A kite has two pairs of adjacent sides that are equal. In this kite, \(FG = FJ\) and \(GH = HJ\). The diagonals \(HF\) and \(GJ\) intersect at right angles.

2. **Given lengths**:
   - Length of \(AH = 15\)
   - Length of \(AG = 12\)

3. **Calculate the length of the diagonal \(HF\)**:
   Since \(HF\) is the height of the kite from vertex \(H\) to side \(AG\), and \(A\) lies on \(HF\), \(HF\) can be considered as the sum of the segments \(AH\) and \(AF\).

4. **Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \(AHF\)**:
   - \(AF = AG + GF = AG + AG = 12 + 12 = 24\) (since \(FG = FJ\))
   - Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle AHF \):
     \[
     AF^2 = AH^2 + HF^2
     \]
     \[
     24^2 = 15^2 + HF^2
     \]
     \[
     576 = 225 + HF^2
     \]
     \[
     HF^2 = 351
     \]
     \[
     HF = \sqrt{351}
     \]

5. **Calculate the length of \(GH\)**:
   Since \(GJ\) is a diagonal of the kite, and using the fact that the diagonals of a kite bisect each other at right angles:
   - \(GJ = 2 \times AG = 24\)
   - Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle GHJ \):
     \[
     GJ^2 = GH^2 + HJ^2
     \]
     Since \(GH = HJ\), let \(GH = x\):
     \[
     24^2 = x^2 + x^2
     \]
     \[
     576 = 2x^2
     \]
     \[
     x^2 = 288
     \]
     \[
     x = \sqrt{288} = 12\sqrt{2}
     \]

However, it seems there might be a misunderstanding. Given the choices, it appears there might be a different approach or a simpler solution considering the choices provided.
