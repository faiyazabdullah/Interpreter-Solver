**1. ANALYZE & EXTRACT**
- We have a triangle ABC with ∠BAC = 60°.
- AB = 18.
- BC is perpendicular to AC.
- We need to find the length of BC, denoted as x.

**2. DEDUCE SYSTEMATICALLY**
- Since ∠BAC = 60° and BC is perpendicular to AC, triangle ABC is a right triangle with ∠BAC = 60°.
- In a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the sides opposite these angles are 1 : √3 : 2.
- Here, AB is the hypotenuse, which corresponds to the side opposite the 90° angle.
- Therefore, if AB is 18, then BC (which is the side opposite the 30° angle) will be half of AB divided by √3.
- BC = AB / (√3) = 18 / (√3) = 18√3 / 3 = 6√3.

However, we see that the options provided do not match our calculated value. Let's re-evaluate:

- AB = 18, and since it forms a 30-60-90 triangle, the side opposite the 60° angle should be half the hypotenuse multiplied by √3.
- BC = AB * (√3)/2 = 18 * (√3)/2 = 9√3.

Thus, the correct calculation shows that BC = 9√3.

**3. CONCLUDE & SELECT**
- The correct length of BC is 9√3.
- From the choices provided, the closest match is B: 9√3.

Final Answer: B
