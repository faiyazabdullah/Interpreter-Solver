QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**1. ANALYZE & EXTRACT**
- The square \(ABCD\) is inscribed in the circle \(\odot K\). This means that each side of the square is tangent to the circle at one point, and the center of the circle \(K\) is equidistant from all four vertices of the square.
- The diagonals of the square intersect at right angles, forming four 45-degree angles with each side.
- Since the square is inscribed in the circle, the diagonal of the square is the diameter of the circle.
- The central angle subtended by the diameter is always 180 degrees because it spans half of the circle's circumference.

**2. DEDUCE SYSTEMATICALLY**
- From the properties of a square inscribed in a circle, we know that the angle subtended by the diameter at the center of the circle is 180 degrees.

**3. CONCLUDE & SELECT**
- The measure of the central angle is 180 degrees.
