**1. ANALYZE & EXTRACT**
- We have a square ABCD with side length 12.
- Angle BAC is \(x\) degrees.
- Line segments AB and AD are equal, and perpendicular to BC and BD respectively.
- We need to find the length of AB, which is \(y\).

**2. DEDUCE SYSTEMATICALLY**
- Since ABCD is a square, all sides are equal and each internal angle is 90 degrees.
- Therefore, triangle ABC is a right triangle with a right angle at B.
- In a right triangle, if one angle is 45 degrees, the other non-right angle must also be 45 degrees because the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
- Hence, \(x = 45^\circ\).
- Triangle ABC is a 45-45-90 triangle, meaning the two legs are congruent and the hypotenuse is \(\sqrt{2}\) times the length of a leg.
- Here, the hypotenuse AC is 12, so each leg AB and BC are \(12/\sqrt{2} = 6\sqrt{2}\).

**3. CONCLUDE & SELECT**
- Therefore, the length of AB, \(y\), is \(6\sqrt{2}\).
