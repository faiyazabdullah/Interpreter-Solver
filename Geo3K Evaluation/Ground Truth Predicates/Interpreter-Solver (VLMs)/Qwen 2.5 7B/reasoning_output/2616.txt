====================================================================================================
To solve for \( x \), we need to analyze the geometric properties of the given figure. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identify the tangents and the circle:**
   - Since \( GK \) appears to be tangent to the circle at point \( G \) and \( HK \) appears to be tangent to the circle at point \( H \), we can use the fact that tangents drawn from a point to a circle are equal in length.

2. **Calculate the lengths:**
   - Given \( JK = 6 \) and \( HJ = 4 \).
   - Since \( GK \) and \( HK \) are tangents, and the tangents from a point outside a circle to the points of tangency are equal, we have \( GK = GH \).

3. **Use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \( GJK \):**
   - In triangle \( GJK \), the sides are \( GJ = x + 4 \) and \( JK = 6 \).
   - Applying the Pythagorean theorem:
     \[
     GJ^2 = GK^2 + JK^2
     \]
     \[
     (x + 4)^2 = x^2 + 6^2
     \]
     \[
     (x + 4)^2 = x^2 + 36
     \]

4. **Expand and simplify the equation:**
   \[
   x^2 + 8x + 16 = x^2 + 36
   \]
   \[
   8x + 16 = 36
   \]
   \[
   8x = 20
   \]
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

Therefore, the value of \( x \) is 5.
