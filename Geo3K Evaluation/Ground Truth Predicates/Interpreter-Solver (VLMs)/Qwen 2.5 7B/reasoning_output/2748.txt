QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To determine which fact would be sufficient to prove that line \(d\) is parallel to line \(XZ\), we need to use the properties of parallel lines and corresponding, alternate interior, and exterior angles.

Given:
- \(d \| XZ\)
- \(\angle 1 = \angle 2\)
- \(\angle 2 = \angle X\)

We need to identify the angle that, when equal to another specific angle, confirms the parallelism.

Let's analyze each option:

A. \(\angle 1 \cong \angle 3\) - This does not provide information about the parallelism directly related to the given setup.

B. \(\angle 1 \cong \angle Z\) - If \(\angle 1 \cong \angle Z\), this implies that \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle Z\) are corresponding angles. Since \(d \| XZ\), corresponding angles are congruent, but here we need to check if it directly confirms the parallelism based on the given angles.

C. \(\angle 2 \cong \angle X\) - This states that \(\angle 2\) and \(\angle X\) are congruent. Given that \(\angle 2\) corresponds to \(\angle X\) due to the parallelism \(d \| XZ\), this confirms the parallelism directly.

D. \(\angle 3 \cong \angle Z\) - Similar to option A, this does not provide direct evidence regarding the parallelism.

Since \(\angle 2\) corresponds to \(\angle X\) and they are congruent, this confirms the parallelism between \(d\) and \(XZ\).
