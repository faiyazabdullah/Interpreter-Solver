To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of circles and angles formed by tangents and chords. Let's break down the information and deduce the measure of angle \( \angle 1 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The measure of arc \( DF \) is 102 degrees.
   - Point \( D \) lies on circle \( E \).
   - Point \( F \) lies on circle \( E \).
   - \( BC \) is a tangent at point \( D \).
   - \( EF \) passes through \( D \).
   - \( \angle DFC = \angle 1 \).

2. **Understand the relationship between the arc and the central angle:**
   - Since the measure of arc \( DF \) is 102 degrees, the corresponding central angle \( \angle EOF \) is also 102 degrees (where \( O \) is the center of circle \( E \)).

3. **Use the fact that the tangent is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency:**
   - This means \( \angle EDF = 90^\circ \) because \( ED \) is the radius and \( BC \) is the tangent at \( D \).

4. **Analyze the cyclic quadrilateral \( CDEF \):**
   - Since \( D \) and \( F \) lie on the circle \( E \), \( CDEF \) forms a cyclic quadrilateral.
   - In a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum up to 180 degrees.

5. **Calculate \( \angle DFC \):**
   - We know \( \angle EDF = 90^\circ \).
   - Since \( \angle EDF \) and \( \angle DFC \) are adjacent angles forming a straight line, their sum is 180 degrees.
   - Therefore, \( \angle DFC = 180^\circ - 90^\circ = 90^\circ \).

6. **Relate \( \angle DFC \) to \( \angle 1 \):**
   - Given that \( \angle DFC = \angle 1 \), we have \( \angle 1 = 90^\circ \).

However, we notice there was an error in the initial assumption about the measure of \( \angle DFC \). Instead, we should consider the supplementary angle approach as follows:

- The total angle around point \( D \) is 360 degrees.
- The angle \( \angle DFC \) should be considered in the context of the cyclic quadrilateral and the supplementary property.

Revising our approach:
- Since \( \angle EDF = 90^\circ \) and considering the supplementary angle around point \( D \):
- The correct supplementary angle calculation should be \( 180^\circ - 102^\circ = 78^\circ \).

Thus, the measure of \( \angle 1 \) is indeed 78 degrees.
