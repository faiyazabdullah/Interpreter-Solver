QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, let's break down the given information and deduce the necessary relationships:

1. **Identify Key Elements:**
   - Circle \(O\) has a radius of 13 inches.
   - Chord \(CD\) is 24 inches long.
   - Radius \(OB\) is perpendicular to chord \(CD\).
   - The measure of arc \(\widehat{CD}\) is 134 degrees.

2. **Calculate the Measure of Arc \(\widehat{CB}\):**
   - Since \(OB\) is perpendicular to \(CD\), it bisects \(CD\). Therefore, \(CB\) and \(BD\) are equal parts of \(CD\). So, each part is \(12\) inches.
   - The total measure of the circle is \(360\) degrees.
   - Given that the measure of arc \(\widehat{CD}\) is \(134\) degrees, we can find the measure of the remaining arcs by subtracting this from \(360\) degrees.

   \[
   \text{Measure of arc } \widehat{CB} = 360^\circ - 134^\circ = 226^\circ
   \]

However, since the problem asks for the measure of arc \(\widehat{CB}\) and the choices provided do not match our calculated value directly, we need to reassess the options given.

Given the choices:
- A. 24
- B. 33
- C. 67
- D. 134

Since none of these choices directly matches our calculated value of \(226^\circ\), we should look at the closest option available.

The closest value among the provided choices to our calculated \(226^\circ\) is \(134^\circ\).

Therefore, the correct answer based on the choices given is:
