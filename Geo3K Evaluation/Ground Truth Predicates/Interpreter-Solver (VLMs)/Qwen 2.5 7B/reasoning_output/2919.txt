QUESTION:
One diagonal of a rhombus is twice as long as the other diagonal. If the area of the rhombus is 169 square millimeters, what are the lengths of the diagonals?

CHOICES:
A. 6.5
B. 13
C. 26
D. 52

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**1. ANALYZE & EXTRACT**
- The rhombus has diagonals AC and BX, where AC = 2x and BX = x.
- The area of the rhombus is given as 169 square millimeters.
- The formula for the area of a rhombus using its diagonals is \( \text{Area} = \frac{d_1 \times d_2}{2} \).

**2. DEDUCE SYSTEMATICALLY**
- Substitute the known values into the area formula: \( \frac{x \cdot 2x}{2} = 169 \).
- Simplify: \( \frac{x^2}{2} = 169 \).
- Multiply both sides by 2: \( x^2 = 338 \).
- Solve for \( x \): \( x = \sqrt{338} \approx 18.38 \).

Since we need the lengths of the diagonals directly, we use the values derived:
- Length of diagonal AC = \( 2x \approx 2 \times 18.38 = 36.76 \).
- Length of diagonal BX = \( x \approx 18.38 \).

**3. CONCLUDE & SELECT**
- The problem asks for the lengths of the diagonals rounded to the nearest whole number.
- The closest option to 36.76 is 36, which matches option B.
- The closest option to 18.38 is 18, which matches option B.

Final Answer: B
