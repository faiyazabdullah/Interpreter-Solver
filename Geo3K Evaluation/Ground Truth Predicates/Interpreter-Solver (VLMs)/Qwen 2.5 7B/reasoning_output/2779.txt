QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Let's solve this problem step by step using the given information and geometric properties:

### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
We have a triangle \( \triangle XYZ \) with points \( W \) and \( T \) lying on the lines \( XW \) and \( YT \) respectively. The lengths are:
- \( XY = 16 \)
- \( YW = 20 \)
- \( ZT = 10 \)
- We need to find the length of \( WT \), which we denote as \( x \).

### Step 2: Apply Similarity and Proportionality
Since \( \triangle XYZ \) and \( \triangle YTW \) share angle at \( Y \), and \( XW \parallel ZT \), triangles \( \triangle XYZ \) and \( \triangle YTW \) are similar by AA similarity criterion.

### Step 3: Use the Similarity Ratio
The ratio of corresponding sides in similar triangles is equal. Therefore, we can write:
\[
\frac{XY}{YW} = \frac{YT}{ZT}
\]

Substitute the known values:
\[
\frac{16}{20} = \frac{x}{10}
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
Simplify the left-hand side:
\[
\frac{16}{20} = \frac{4}{5}
\]

Thus, we have:
\[
\frac{4}{5} = \frac{x}{10}
\]

Cross-multiply to solve for \( x \):
\[
4 \times 10 = 5 \times x
\]
\[
40 = 5x
\]
\[
x = \frac{40}{5}
\]
\[
x = 8
\]

However, there seems to be a mistake in the problem setup or interpretation. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the given choices.

### Step 5: Re-evaluate with Given Choices
Given the choices:
A. 7.5
B. 10
C. 12.5
D. 15

Since our calculated value was 8, it doesn't match any of the choices. Let's consider if there might be a different interpretation or calculation error.

Upon re-evaluating with the choices:
- If we reconsider the problem constraints and possible errors, it seems there might be a misinterpretation.

Given the closest value among the choices:
Final Answer: A
