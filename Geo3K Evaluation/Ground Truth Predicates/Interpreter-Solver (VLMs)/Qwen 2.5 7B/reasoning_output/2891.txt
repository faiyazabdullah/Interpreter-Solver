To solve this problem, we need to find the length of BD given the conditions in the circle and the lengths provided.

First, let's identify the important information:
- The diameter of the circle is AB = 8.
- CE = 13.5.
- Since CE is a chord of the circle, it can be split into segments by point D where CE intersects the circle at points E and C.

Since CE is a chord and D is the midpoint of the perpendicular bisector of CE (as indicated by the right angle at D), D is the midpoint of the segment joining the endpoints of the chord CE.

Using the properties of the circle:
- The length of the chord CE can be split into two equal segments since D is the midpoint of the perpendicular bisector.
- Therefore, CD = DE = CE / 2 = 13.5 / 2 = 6.75.

Now, using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle BCD:
\[ BC^2 = BD^2 + CD^2 \]
Given BC = 8 (the diameter of the circle):
\[ 8^2 = BD^2 + 6.75^2 \]
\[ 64 = BD^2 + 45.5625 \]
\[ BD^2 = 64 - 45.5625 \]
\[ BD^2 = 18.4375 \]
\[ BD = \sqrt{18.4375} \approx 4.29 \]

Therefore, the length of BD is approximately 4.29.

Final Answer: B
