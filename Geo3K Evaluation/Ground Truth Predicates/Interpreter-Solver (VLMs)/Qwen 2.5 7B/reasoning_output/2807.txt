QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use the Power of a Point theorem. This theorem states that for a point \( P \) outside a circle, if two lines through \( P \) intersect the circle at points \( A \) and \( B \) on one line and \( C \) and \( D \) on another line, then the product of the lengths of the segments of one line is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments of the other line. That is:

\[ PA \cdot PB = PC \cdot PD \]

In our problem, point \( E \) lies on the line \( AB \) and also on the line \( CD \). Therefore, we can apply the Power of a Point theorem at point \( E \):

\[ AE \cdot EB = CE \cdot ED \]

We know the following lengths:
- \( AE = x \)
- \( EB = 6 \)
- \( CE = 3 \)
- \( ED = 4 \)

Substituting these values into the Power of a Point equation, we get:

\[ x \cdot 6 = 3 \cdot 4 \]

Simplifying the right-hand side:

\[ 6x = 12 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{12}{6} = 2 \]

Therefore, the value of \( x \) is 2.
