**1. ANALYZE & EXTRACT**

- We have a rhombus \(ABCD\) where the lengths of sides \(AB\) and \(BC\) are given as \(2x + 3\) and \(5x\) respectively.
- Since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, all its sides are equal, which implies \(2x + 3 = 5x\).
- Solving for \(x\), we get \(2x + 3 = 5x \Rightarrow 3 = 3x \Rightarrow x = 1\).
- Therefore, the length of each side is \(2(1) + 3 = 5\).

**2. DEDUCE SYSTEMATICALLY**

- With the side lengths known, we find the diagonals intersect at point \(E\). In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles.
- Let's denote the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) as \(d_1\) and \(d_2\) respectively.
- Since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, triangle \(AEB\) is a right triangle at \(E\).
- Using the properties of the rhombus, the diagonals split the rhombus into four congruent right triangles, meaning \(\angle AEB = 90^\circ\).

**3. CONCLUDE & SELECT**

- From the analysis above, it is clear that \(\angle AEB = 90^\circ\).
