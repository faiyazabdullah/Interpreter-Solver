To find the circumference of the circle, we first need to determine the radius of the circle. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step process:

1. **Identify the given information**: The length of the chord \(BC\) is 6.2 cm. This chord passes through the center of the circle, making it a diameter of the circle since the point \(A\) lies on the circle and is the midpoint of the chord \(BC\).

2. **Calculate the radius**: Since \(BC\) is the diameter, the radius \(r\) of the circle is half of the length of the chord \(BC\).
   \[
   r = \frac{BC}{2} = \frac{6.2}{2} = 3.1 \text{ cm}
   \]

3. **Use the formula for the circumference**: The circumference \(C\) of a circle is given by \(C = 2\pi r\).
   \[
   C = 2\pi \times 3.1 = 6.2\pi \approx 6.2 \times 3.14159 \approx 19.5 \text{ cm}
   \]

Rounding to the nearest tenth, the circumference is approximately 19.5 cm.

Thus, the final answer is:
