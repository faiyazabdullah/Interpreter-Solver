QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of circles and angles subtended by arcs.

Given:
- \( m\angle ABC = 70^\circ \)
- The minor arc \( AC \) is \( x \) degrees.
- The major arc \( AD \) is \( y \) degrees.
- Since the sum of the measures of the arcs around a point is \(360^\circ\), we have:
\[ x + y = 360^\circ \]

We also know that the angle \( \angle ABC \) is subtended by the arc \( AC \). According to the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts. Therefore:
\[ m\angle ABC = \frac{1}{2} m\text{(arc } AC) \]
\[ 70^\circ = \frac{1}{2} x \]
\[ x = 2 \times 70^\circ = 140^\circ \]

Thus, the measure of the minor arc \( AC \) is \( x = 140^\circ \).

Since the choices provided do not match our calculated value, we need to re-evaluate the problem setup or check the given options again.

Upon re-evaluation, we notice that the correct interpretation should be:
\[ x = 140^\circ \]

However, the choices provided do not include \( 140^\circ \). Given the options, the closest reasonable value would be:
