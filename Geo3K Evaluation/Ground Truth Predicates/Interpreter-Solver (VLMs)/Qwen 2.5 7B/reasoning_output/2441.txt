QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use the given information about the angles and the relationships between the lines and points in the figure. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. We know that \( m\angle 3 = 110^\circ \) and \( m\angle 12 = 55^\circ \).

2. From the diagram and the given relationships, we can deduce that \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 12 \) are related to other angles in the figure. Specifically, \( \angle 3 \) is part of a straight line relationship with another angle which sums up to \( 180^\circ \).

3. Since \( \angle 3 = 110^\circ \), the angle adjacent to it on the same straight line would be \( 180^\circ - 110^\circ = 70^\circ \).

4. Now, consider the angle \( \angle 12 \). Since \( \angle 12 = 55^\circ \), and knowing the sum of angles around a point or in a straight line, we can infer the relationship between these angles.

5. To find \( \angle 1 \), we need to look at the relationships involving the angles around point \( A \). Given the parallel lines and the angles formed by them, we can use the fact that the sum of angles around a point is \( 360^\circ \).

6. By examining the angles around point \( A \), we can see that \( \angle 1 \) is part of a straight line relationship with \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 12 \). Therefore, if we add the known angles and the angles around point \( A \), we can deduce that \( \angle 1 \) is supplementary to the sum of the known angles around it.

Given the options:
- \( \angle 1 \) should be \( 180^\circ - 110^\circ = 70^\circ \).
- However, considering the full circle around point \( A \) and the supplementary nature of angles, the correct supplementary angle that fits the pattern would be \( 135^\circ \).

Therefore, the measure of \( \angle 1 \) is \( 135^\circ \).
