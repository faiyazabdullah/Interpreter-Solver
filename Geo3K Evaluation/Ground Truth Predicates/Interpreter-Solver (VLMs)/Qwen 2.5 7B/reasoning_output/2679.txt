QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve for \(x\) in the given problem, we need to use the properties of parallel lines and angles.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \(\angle AGC = 55^\circ\)
   - \(\angle EFG = x^\circ\)
   - Lines \(GC\) and \(FE\) are parallel.

2. **Use the properties of parallel lines:**
   Since \(GC \parallel FE\), the alternate interior angles formed by a transversal line will be equal. Specifically, \(\angle AGF\) and \(\angle EFG\) are corresponding angles.

3. **Analyze the angles around point \(G\):**
   - \(\angle AGF = \angle EFG = x^\circ\)
   - Since \(H\) lies on line \(AG\), \(\angle AGH\) is a straight angle, meaning it is \(180^\circ\).
   - Therefore, \(\angle AGF + \angle HGF = 180^\circ\).

4. **Calculate \(\angle HGF\):**
   - \(\angle HGF = 180^\circ - \angle AGF = 180^\circ - x^\circ\).

5. **Use the fact that \(\angle AGF = 55^\circ\):**
   - Since \(\angle AGF\) is part of the straight line, the remaining angle \(\angle HGF\) can be calculated as:
     \[
     \angle HGF = 180^\circ - 55^\circ = 125^\circ.
     \]

6. **Relate this to \(\angle EFG\):**
   - Since \(\angle EFG\) is part of the triangle at point \(G\), and knowing that the sum of angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\), we have:
     \[
     x + 55^\circ + \angle EFG' = 180^\circ,
     \]
     where \(\angle EFG'\) is the supplementary angle to \(\angle EFG\) when considering the straight line.

7. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - From the above, we have:
     \[
     x + 55^\circ = 125^\circ.
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     x = 125^\circ - 55^\circ = 70^\circ.
     \]

However, there seems to be a discrepancy because the choices provided do not match our calculation. Let's re-evaluate the problem carefully:

Given the choices:
- A. 55
- B. 115
- C. 125
- D. 135

Since our calculated value of \(x\) is \(70^\circ\), and none of the provided choices match, we should recheck the problem statement or the interpretation of the figure. Given the choices, the closest value is \(115^\circ\), which might be due to a misinterpretation of the problem setup or a different context.

Thus, the correct answer based on the choices provided is:
Final Answer: B
