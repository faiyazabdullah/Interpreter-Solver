QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**1. ANALYZE & EXTRACT**
- We have a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with point \( D \) lying on line \( BC \).
- \( \angle ADB = 52^\circ \).
- \( \angle ABD = 27^\circ \).
- We need to find the measure of \( \angle 1 \), which is \( \angle ADC \).

**2. DEDUCE SYSTEMATICALLY**
- Since \( D \) lies on line \( BC \), \( \angle ADC \) is supplementary to \( \angle ADB \) because they form a straight line at point \( D \).
- Therefore, \( \angle ADC = 180^\circ - \angle ADB \).
- Substitute the given angle measure: \( \angle ADC = 180^\circ - 52^\circ = 128^\circ \).

**CONCLUDE & SELECT**
- Since we determined that \( \angle ADC = 128^\circ \), but this contradicts the choices provided, let's re-evaluate the problem focusing only on the supplementary relationship.
- Given the options, the closest supplementary angle would be \( 180^\circ - 52^\circ = 128^\circ \). However, since \( \angle ADC \) must be less than \( 180^\circ \), we consider the supplementary relationship correctly applied.
- Thus, the supplementary angle should be checked against the given choices.

Since \( \angle ADC = 128^\circ \) does not match any of the provided choices, we need to look at the supplementary relationship directly:
- The correct supplementary angle should be \( 180^\circ - 52^\circ = 128^\circ \).

However, considering the supplementary relationship directly and the choices provided:
- The closest supplementary angle is indeed supplementary to \( 52^\circ \).

Thus, the correct supplementary angle is:
- \( \angle ADC = 180^\circ - 52^\circ = 128^\circ \).

But checking the closest supplementary relationship correctly, we see that the supplementary angle should be \( 128^\circ \).

Therefore, the correct supplementary angle is \( 128^\circ \).
