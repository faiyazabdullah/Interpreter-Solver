QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve for \( x \), we need to analyze the given geometric relationships and apply relevant theorems and properties of circles and angles.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Key Relationships:**
   - We know that \( \angle FBG = 70^\circ \).
   - Points \( J \), \( H \), \( F \), and \( G \) lie on circle \( \odot B \) with radius \( 3.0 \).

2. **Central Angle and Inscribed Angle Relationship:**
   - Since \( \angle FBG \) is an inscribed angle, it intercepts arc \( FG \).
   - The measure of the arc \( FG \) can be calculated as twice the measure of the inscribed angle \( \angle FBG \):
     \[
     \text{Measure of arc } FG = 2 \times \text{Measure of } \angle FBG = 2 \times 70^\circ = 140^\circ
     \]

3. **Central Angle Relationship:**
   - The central angle \( \angle FBG \) subtends the same arc \( FG \). Therefore, the measure of the central angle \( \angle FBG \) is equal to the measure of arc \( FG \):
     \[
     \text{Measure of } \angle FBG = 140^\circ
     \]

4. **Sum of Angles in Triangle \( \triangle HBJ \):**
   - In triangle \( \triangle HBJ \), the sum of the interior angles is \( 180^\circ \):
     \[
     \angle HBJ + \angle BHJ + \angle JHB = 180^\circ
     \]
   - Since \( \angle HBJ \) is the same as \( \angle FBG \) (both are \( 140^\circ \)), we have:
     \[
     140^\circ + x + x = 180^\circ
     \]
   - Simplifying this equation:
     \[
     140^\circ + 2x = 180^\circ
     \]
     \[
     2x = 180^\circ - 140^\circ
     \]
     \[
     2x = 40^\circ
     \]
     \[
     x = 20^\circ
     \]

5. **Re-evaluate Based on Choices:**
   - The calculated value \( x = 20^\circ \) does not match any of the given choices (A, B, C, D).

Given the problem setup and the provided choices, there seems to be a discrepancy. However, based on the closest logical fit among the given options:
