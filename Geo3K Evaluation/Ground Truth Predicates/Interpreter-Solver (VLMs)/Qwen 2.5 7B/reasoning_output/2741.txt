To find \( m \angle PSR \), we need to understand the properties of an equilateral pentagon inscribed in a circle.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Central Angles**: 
   Since the pentagon is regular and inscribed in a circle, each central angle subtended by one side of the pentagon is equal. There are five sides, so the measure of each central angle is:
   \[
   \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
   \]

2. **Central Angle to Inscribed Angle Relationship**:
   Each inscribed angle \( \angle PSR \) is half the measure of the corresponding central angle because the inscribed angle intercepts the same arc as the central angle but measures half its value. Therefore:
   \[
   \angle PSR = \frac{1}{2} \times 72^\circ = 36^\circ
   \]

3. **Verify the Conclusion**:
   This calculation shows that the measure of \( \angle PSR \) is indeed 36 degrees, which matches option A.
