QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve for AD given the lengths DB = 24, AE = 3, and EC = 18, we need to analyze the geometric relationships provided.

1. **Identify the segments and their lengths:**
   - DB = 24
   - AE = 3
   - EC = 18

2. **Understand the relationship between points and lines:**
   - Point D lies on line AB.
   - Point E lies on line AC.
   - Line DE is parallel to line BC.

Given these relationships, we can use the properties of similar triangles. Since DE is parallel to BC, triangles ADE and ABC are similar by AA similarity criterion.

3. **Set up the proportion using similar triangles:**
   Since triangles ADE and ABC are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal:
   \[
   \frac{AD}{AB} = \frac{AE}{AC}
   \]

4. **Substitute the known values into the proportion:**
   \[
   \frac{AD}{AD + DB} = \frac{AE}{AE + EC}
   \]
   Here, \( AB = AD + DB \) and \( AC = AE + EC \).

   Substitute the given values:
   \[
   \frac{AD}{AD + 24} = \frac{3}{3 + 18}
   \]
   Simplify the right-hand side:
   \[
   \frac{3}{21} = \frac{1}{7}
   \]

5. **Solve for AD:**
   \[
   \frac{AD}{AD + 24} = \frac{1}{7}
   \]
   Cross-multiply to solve for AD:
   \[
   7AD = AD + 24
   \]
   Subtract AD from both sides:
   \[
   6AD = 24
   \]
   Divide both sides by 6:
   \[
   AD = 4
   \]

Thus, the length of AD is 4.

**Final Answer: B**
