To solve this problem, we need to use the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side.

Given:
- Length of Line(A, B) = 12
- Length of Line(A, C) = 7

Let's denote the length of Line(B, C) as \(x\).

### Applying the Triangle Inequality Theorem:

1. **Triangle inequality between A, B, and C:**
   \[
   7 + x > 12
   \]
   Simplifying,
   \[
   x > 5
   \]

2. **Triangle inequality between A, C, and B:**
   \[
   12 + 7 > x
   \]
   Simplifying,
   \[
   x < 19
   \]

Combining these inequalities, we get:
\[
5 < x < 19
\]

Now, let's calculate the possible perimeters:
- The perimeter of the triangle is given by:
  \[
  P = 12 + 7 + x = 19 + x
  \]

Since \(5 < x < 19\), we have:
\[
24 < 19 + x < 38
\]

Thus, the possible values for the perimeter \(P\) range from 24 to 38. Let's check the given options:
- Option A: 29
- Option B: 34
- Option C: 37
- Option D: 38

Among these, the only value that does not fall within the range of possible perimeters is 38.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
Final Answer: D
