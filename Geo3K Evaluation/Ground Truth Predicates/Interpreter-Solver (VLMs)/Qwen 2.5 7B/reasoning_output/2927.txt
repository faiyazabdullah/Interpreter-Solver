====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of similar trapezoids and their areas.

Given:
- \( \text{Area}(J K L M) = 138 \)
- \( \text{Area}(Q R S T) = 5.52 \)
- Trapezoids \( J K L M \) and \( Q R S T \) are similar.

For similar trapezoids, the ratio of their areas is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths. Since the trapezoids are similar, the ratio of their areas is the same as the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths.

Let's denote the ratio of the corresponding sides by \( k \). Therefore, the ratio of the areas is \( k^2 \).

We can set up the following equation based on the areas:
\[ \frac{\text{Area}(J K L M)}{\text{Area}(Q R S T)} = k^2 \]
\[ \frac{138}{5.52} = k^2 \]

Now, calculate the value of \( k^2 \):
\[ k^2 = \frac{138}{5.52} = \frac{138 \times 100}{5.52 \times 100} = \frac{13800}{552} = \frac{13800 \div 24}{552 \div 24} = \frac{575}{23} \approx 25 \]

Thus,
\[ k^2 = 25 \]
\[ k = \sqrt{25} = 5 \]

Since \( k \) is the ratio of the corresponding side lengths, and we know the length of \( KJ \) is 5 ft, the length of \( QT \) should be:
\[ x = k \times 5 = 5 \times 5 = 25 \]

Therefore, the value of \( x \) is 25.
