QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve for \(a\) in the given parallelogram, we need to use the properties of parallelograms and the given information about the lengths of the sides.

Given:
- \(WY = 10\)
- \(XA = a - 7\)
- \(AY = 2\)
- \(AZ = 2b - 6\)

In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. Therefore:
- \(WX = YZ\)
- \(XY = WZ\)

We also know that \(WY\) is a diagonal, and since \(A\) is the intersection point of the diagonals, it divides each diagonal into two equal parts.

From the given lengths:
- Since \(AY = 2\) and \(AZ = 2b - 6\), and considering that \(A\) divides \(YZ\) into two segments, we can infer that the total length of \(YZ\) is split such that:
\[ YZ = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]
\[ YZ = 2b - 6 \]

Since \(YZ\) is the same as \(WX\) (opposite sides of a parallelogram):
\[ WX = YZ = 4 \]

Now, using the diagonal property:
\[ WX = 10 \]

Given that \(WX = YZ\), we equate the lengths:
\[ YZ = WX = 10 \]
\[ 2b - 6 = 10 \]

Solving for \(b\):
\[ 2b - 6 = 10 \]
\[ 2b = 16 \]
\[ b = 8 \]

Next, we need to find \(a\). Using the length of \(XA\):
\[ XA = a - 7 \]
Since \(XA\) is part of the diagonal \(WX\), and knowing that \(WX = 10\), we can infer:
\[ XA + AZ = 10 \]

Substitute \(AZ\) with \(2b - 6 = 10\):
\[ XA + 10 = 10 \]
\[ XA = 0 \]

Thus, the value of \(a\) should satisfy:
\[ a - 7 = 0 \]
\[ a = 7 \]

However, this contradicts the options provided. Re-evaluating the problem, we notice that the correct interpretation should be:
\[ WX = YZ = 10 \]
\[ 2b - 6 = 10 \]
\[ 2b = 16 \]
\[ b = 8 \]

Rechecking \(a\):
\[ XA = a - 7 = 10 \]
\[ a = 17 \]

This does not match the provided choices either. Given the options:
\[ a = 8 \]

Final Answer: B
