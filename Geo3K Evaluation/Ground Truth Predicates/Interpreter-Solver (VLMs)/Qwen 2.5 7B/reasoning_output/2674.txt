QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given geometric relationships and use circle properties and angle theorems.

1. **Identify Key Elements**: We have a circle centered at \( F \) with points \( A, B, C, D, E \) lying on it. The measure of angle \( \angle D FA \) is given as 50 degrees, and \( CF \perp FB \).

2. **Analyze the Perpendicularity**: Since \( CF \perp FB \), triangle \( CFB \) is a right triangle with \( \angle CFB = 90^\circ \). This implies that point \( C \) forms a right angle with \( F \) when extended through \( B \).

3. **Central Angle and Inscribed Angle Relationship**: The measure of the arc \( AD \) subtended by angle \( \angle D FA \) is twice the measure of the angle itself because the arc length is directly proportional to the central angle. Therefore, the measure of arc \( AD \) is \( 2 \times 50^\circ = 100^\circ \).

4. **Inscribed Angle Calculation**: The inscribed angle \( \angle AEC \) intercepts the same arc \( AC \) as the central angle \( \angle AEC \). The measure of arc \( AC \) is the sum of the arcs \( AD \) and \( DC \). Since \( D \) lies on the circle, the total arc \( AD + DC = 360^\circ \). Hence, arc \( AC = 360^\circ - 100^\circ = 260^\circ \).

5. **Arc Length Calculation**: The measure of arc \( AC \) is \( 260^\circ \). To find the measure of arc \( AEC \), which is the remaining part of the circle not covered by arc \( AC \):
   \[
   \text{Measure of arc } AEC = 360^\circ - 260^\circ = 100^\circ
   \]

Thus, the measure of arc \( AEC \) is \( 100^\circ \).

Given the choices provided:
- A. 75
- B. 115
- C. 150
- D. 230

None of these options match our calculated value of \( 100^\circ \). However, considering the problem's structure and the closest matching option, we should select the closest value among the given choices.
