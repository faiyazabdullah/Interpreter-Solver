To determine which angles are supplementary to angle 1, we need to use the properties of parallel lines and transversals.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Line \( l \) is parallel to line \( m \).
   - Line \( n \) intersects both \( l \) and \( m \).

2. **Understand the relationships:**
   - Since \( l \parallel m \), the angles formed by the intersection of line \( n \) with these parallel lines will have specific relationships due to the properties of parallel lines and transversals.

3. **Analyze the angles:**
   - Angle 1 is formed at the intersection of line \( n \) with line \( l \).
   - Because of the parallelism, the corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and same-side interior angles will be important.

4. **Determine the supplementary angles:**
   - Supplementary angles add up to 180 degrees.
   - Corresponding angles: These are equal due to the parallel lines. So, angle 3 corresponds to angle 7 because they are on the same side of the transversal \( n \) and the same position relative to lines \( l \) and \( m \).
   - Alternate interior angles: These are also equal. So, angle 5 corresponds to angle 6 because they are on opposite sides of the transversal \( n \) and between lines \( l \) and \( m \).
   - Same-side interior angles: These are supplementary. So, angle 4 is supplementary to angle 2.

From the above, the angles supplementary to angle 1 are angle 2, angle 3, angle 4, and angle 7.

Thus, the correct choice is:
