QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**1. ANALYZE & EXTRACT**
- We have two angles at point \( B \): \( \angle RBT = x^\circ \) and \( \angle STB = 2x^\circ \).
- Since these angles form part of a circle, they subtend arcs \( RT \) and \( ST \) respectively.
- By the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
- Therefore, arc \( RT \) corresponds to angle \( \angle RBT \), which is \( x^\circ \), so the arc length \( RT \) is \( 2x^\circ \).
- Similarly, arc \( ST \) corresponds to angle \( \angle STB \), which is \( 2x^\circ \), so the arc length \( ST \) is \( 4x^\circ \).

**2. DEDUCE SYSTEMATICALLY**
- The sum of the measures of arcs \( RT \) and \( ST \) together with arc \( RS \) must equal the total circumference of the circle, which is \( 360^\circ \).
- Therefore, we set up the equation: \( 2x + 4x + RS = 360 \).
- Simplifying, we get: \( 6x + RS = 360 \).

**3. CONCLUDE & SELECT**
- Given that points \( R, B, T \) lie on the circle centered at \( B \) with radius \( 3 \):
- Arc \( RS \) can be found by subtracting the known arc lengths from \( 360^\circ \):
- \( RS = 360^\circ - 2x - 4x = 360^\circ - 6x \).
- To find \( x \), solve the equation:
\[ 6x + (360^\circ - 6x) = 360^\circ \]
\[ 6x + 360^\circ - 6x = 360^\circ \]
\[ 360^\circ = 360^\circ \]

Since this simplifies correctly, we need to find \( x \):
\[ 6x = 90^\circ \]
\[ x = 15^\circ \]

However, it seems there's a discrepancy with choices provided. Let's recheck:
- If \( x = 30^\circ \), then \( 6x = 180^\circ \), but the total is \( 360^\circ \). Thus, correct value fits best as \( x = 60^\circ \).
