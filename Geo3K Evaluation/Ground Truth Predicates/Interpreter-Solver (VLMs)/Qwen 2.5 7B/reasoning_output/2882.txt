QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to use the given information and properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and circle geometry.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Cyclic Quadrilateral:**
   - Points \(G, H, K, J\) form a cyclic quadrilateral because they lie on the same circle centered at \(L\).

2. **Use the Inscribed Angle Theorem:**
   - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts.
   - Therefore, \(\angle GLJ = 83^\circ\) implies that the arc \(GK\) intercepted by this angle is \(166^\circ\).

3. **Arc Length Calculation:**
   - Since \(GK\) is an arc, the length of the arc \(GK\) is proportional to its degree measure relative to the full circle \(360^\circ\).
   - The length of arc \(GK\) can be calculated as \(\frac{166}{360} \times 2\pi r\), where \(r\) is the radius of the circle.

4. **Inscribed Angle Theorem Application:**
   - For \(\angle HKJ\), which is also an inscribed angle, the intercepted arc is \(HK\).
   - Given that \(\angle HKJ = 2x - 27^\circ\), the intercepted arc \(HK\) is \(2(2x - 27)\).

5. **Sum of Arc Measures:**
   - The sum of the arcs \(GK\) and \(HK\) must equal the full circumference minus the arc \(GH\):
     \[
     \text{Arc } GK + \text{Arc } HK = 360^\circ
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     166 + 2(2x - 27) = 360
     \]

6. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     166 + 4x - 54 = 360
     \]
     \[
     112 + 4x = 360
     \]
     \[
     4x = 248
     \]
     \[
     x = 62
     \]

Since none of the provided choices match \(x = 62\), let's recheck the problem constraints or assumptions. Given the options, the closest match is:
