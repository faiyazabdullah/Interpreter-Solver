QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of a kite. Specifically, in a kite, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. This means that the point where they intersect (P) divides each diagonal into two equal parts. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the lengths and properties:**
   - We know \( WX = XY = 6 \).
   - \( PX = 4 \).

2. **Use the Pythagorean theorem to find \( WP \):**
   - Since \( P \) is the midpoint of \( WZ \), \( PW = PX = 4 \).

Therefore, the length \( WP \) is:
\[ WP = 4 \]
