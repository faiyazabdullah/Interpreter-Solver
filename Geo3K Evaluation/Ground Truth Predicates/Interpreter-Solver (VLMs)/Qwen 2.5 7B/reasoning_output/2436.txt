QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, let's break down the given information and use the properties of circles and angles:

1. We know that the measure of arc \(BC\) is \(30^\circ\).
2. We also know that the measure of arc \(AD\) is \(20^\circ\).

Since the measure of an angle subtended by an arc at the center of the circle is twice the measure of the arc itself, we can use this property to find the measures of angles involved.

Given that point \(F\) lies on the circle with radius 5.0 units, and considering the arcs and angles formed, we need to find the measure of \(\angle 2\).

Since \(E\) lies on the lines \(AB\) and \(AC\), and considering the circle properties, the angle \(\angle BEC\) is half the measure of the arc \(BC\) which is \(30^\circ\). Therefore, \(\angle BEC = 15^\circ\).

Similarly, \(\angle AEC\) is half the measure of the arc \(AD\) which is \(20^\circ\). Therefore, \(\angle AEC = 10^\circ\).

Now, since \(\angle BEC\) and \(\angle AEC\) form the angles around point \(E\), the sum of these angles plus the angle \(\angle 2\) should be \(180^\circ\).

Thus, we have:
\[ \angle BEC + \angle AEC + \angle 2 = 180^\circ \]
\[ 15^\circ + 10^\circ + \angle 2 = 180^\circ \]
\[ 25^\circ + \angle 2 = 180^\circ \]
\[ \angle 2 = 180^\circ - 25^\circ \]
\[ \angle 2 = 155^\circ \]

Therefore, the measure of \(\angle 2\) is \(155^\circ\).
