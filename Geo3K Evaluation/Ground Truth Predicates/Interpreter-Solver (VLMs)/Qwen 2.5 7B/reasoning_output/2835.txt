To solve this problem, we need to find the side length of a square inscribed in a circle with a given area.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Given Information:**
   - The area of the circle is \(18\pi\) square units.
   - Therefore, the radius \(r\) of the circle can be found using the formula for the area of a circle, \(A = \pi r^2\):
     \[
     \pi r^2 = 18\pi
     \]
     Dividing both sides by \(\pi\):
     \[
     r^2 = 18
     \]
     Taking the square root of both sides:
     \[
     r = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}
     \]

2. **Relationship Between the Square and the Circle:**
   - For a square inscribed in a circle, the diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle.
   - Let the side length of the square be \(s\).
   - The diagonal of the square can be expressed as \(s\sqrt{2}\).
   - Since the diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle, we have:
     \[
     s\sqrt{2} = 2r
     \]

3. **Substitute the Radius:**
   - Substitute \(r = 3\sqrt{2}\) into the equation:
     \[
     s\sqrt{2} = 2 \times 3\sqrt{2}
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     s\sqrt{2} = 6\sqrt{2}
     \]

4. **Solve for \(s\):**
   - Divide both sides by \(\sqrt{2}\):
     \[
     s = 6
     \]

Thus, the side length of the square is \(6\).
