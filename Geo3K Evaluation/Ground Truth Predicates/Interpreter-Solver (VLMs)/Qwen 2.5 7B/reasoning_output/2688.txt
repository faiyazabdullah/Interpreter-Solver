**1. ANALYZE & EXTRACT**
- We have a parallelogram \( WXZY \).
- \( WX = 8 \).
- \( BX = s - 7 \).
- \( BY = 6 \).
- \( BZ = 2t - 6 \).

**2. DEDUCE SYSTEMATICALLY**
- In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal.
- Therefore, \( WX = ZY \) and \( XY = WZ \).

- From the given, \( WX = 8 \), so \( ZY = 8 \).

- Since \( B \) lies on both lines \( ZW \) and \( XY \), we need to find a relationship involving \( t \).

- We know \( BX = s - 7 \) and \( BY = 6 \).

- Using the fact that \( BZ = 2t - 6 \), we can infer the properties of the parallelogram and its diagonals.

- Since \( B \) divides the diagonal \( WZ \) into two segments such that the sum of these segments equals the length of the diagonal, we use the property of the diagonals of a parallelogram intersecting at their midpoint.

- The total length of \( BZ \) should be consistent with the properties of the parallelogram.

- Given that \( BY = 6 \), we need to solve for \( t \):

\[ 2t - 6 = 6 \]

\[ 2t = 12 \]

\[ t = 6 \]
