QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use the given lengths and the fact that the lines are parallel and lie on specific segments.

Given:
- \( \text{Length}(XN) = 6 \)
- \( \text{Length}(XM) = 2 \)
- \( \text{Length}(XY) = 10 \)
- Lines \( ZY \) and \( NM \) are parallel.

Since \( ZY \parallel NM \) and they are segments of the same line extended, we can use the properties of similar triangles and proportional segments.

First, observe that since \( ZY \parallel NM \), triangles \( \triangle XZN \) and \( \triangle XYN \) are similar by AA similarity (since corresponding angles are equal due to the parallel lines).

Using the similarity of triangles:

\[
\frac{\text{Length}(XZ)}{\text{Length}(XY)} = \frac{\text{Length}(XN)}{\text{Length}(XM)}
\]

Substitute the known lengths:

\[
\frac{\text{Length}(XZ)}{10} = \frac{6}{2}
\]

Simplify the right-hand side:

\[
\frac{\text{Length}(XZ)}{10} = 3
\]

Multiply both sides by 10 to solve for \( \text{Length}(XZ) \):

\[
\text{Length}(XZ) = 3 \times 10 = 30
\]

Since \( XN = 6 \) and \( XM = 2 \), and knowing that \( XZ \) is the sum of these two segments:

\[
\text{Length}(XZ) = XN + XZ
\]

We already found \( \text{Length}(XZ) = 30 \).

Thus, the length of \( NZ \) is:

\[
\text{Length}(NZ) = XZ - XN = 30 - 6 = 24
\]

Therefore, the length of \( NZ \) is:
