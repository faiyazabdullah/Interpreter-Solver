QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**1. ANALYZE & EXTRACT**
- The segment VT is tangent to the circle at point V.
- The length of VT is given as 11.
- Point U lies on the circle centered at T with radius equal to VT.
- Point B lies on the line VT.
- The length of BV is unknown but can be deduced using the Pythagorean theorem since BV is perpendicular to TV.

**2. DEDUCE SYSTEMATICALLY**
- Since VT is tangent to the circle at V, TV is the radius and TV = 11.
- Triangle TVU is a right triangle with TV as one leg, BV as the other leg, and TU as the hypotenuse.
- By the Pythagorean theorem: \( TV^2 + BV^2 = TU^2 \).
- Given TV = 11 and TU = x, we have: \( 11^2 + BV^2 = x^2 \).
- To find BV, note that BV is the remaining part of the chord VT minus TV: \( BV = 11 - BV \).

Using these relationships:
\[ BV^2 + BV^2 = x^2 \]
\[ 11^2 + BV^2 = x^2 \]
\[ 121 + BV^2 = x^2 \]

Since BV is the same as BV, solve for BV:
\[ BV = \sqrt{x^2 - 121} \]
\[ BV = 7 \]

Thus:
\[ \sqrt{x^2 - 121} = 7 \]
\[ x^2 - 121 = 49 \]
\[ x^2 = 170 \]
\[ x = \sqrt{170} \approx 13.0 \]

**3. CONCLUDE & SELECT**
