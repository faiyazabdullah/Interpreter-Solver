To solve for \( m \angle H \), let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Key Angles:**
   - We know \( m \angle KBF = 88^\circ \).
   - We know \( m \angle JBG = 26^\circ \).

2. **Understand the Geometry:**
   - Points \( G, F, J, K \) lie on the circle centered at \( B \) with radius 4 units.
   - Since \( G, F, J, K \) are points on the circle, they form a cyclic quadrilateral with respect to the circle.

3. **Angle Properties in a Cyclic Quadrilateral:**
   - In a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of opposite angles is \( 180^\circ \).

4. **Calculate Opposite Angles:**
   - Let \( m \angle HGF = x \). Since \( G, F, J, K \) are on the circle, \( \angle HGF \) and \( \angle HJF \) are supplementary because they form a straight line when connected through the circle.

5. **Sum of Angles in Triangle HGF:**
   - The sum of angles in triangle \( HGF \) is \( 180^\circ \).
   - Therefore, \( m \angle GHF = 180^\circ - (m \angle HGF + m \angle HFG) \).

6. **Relate Known Angles:**
   - Given \( m \angle JBG = 26^\circ \) and knowing the circle properties, we can infer that the angle subtended by arc \( JK \) at point \( B \) is twice the angle \( JBG \) (i.e., \( 2 \times 26^\circ = 52^\circ \)).
   - This implies that the angle subtended by arc \( GK \) at point \( B \) is also \( 52^\circ \).

7. **Determine \( m \angle HGF \):**
   - Since \( G, F, J, K \) are on the circle, and considering the symmetry and properties of the circle, \( m \angle HGF = 180^\circ - 52^\circ = 128^\circ \).

8. **Calculate \( m \angle HFG \):**
   - Using the fact that the sum of angles in triangle \( HGF \) is \( 180^\circ \):
     \[
     m \angle HFG = 180^\circ - (m \angle HGF + m \angle HFG) = 180^\circ - 128^\circ = 52^\circ.
     \]

9. **Determine \( m \angle H \):**
   - Since \( m \angle JBG = 26^\circ \) and the angle subtended by arc \( JK \) at point \( B \) is \( 52^\circ \), the remaining angle \( m \angle H \) can be found by subtracting these known angles from \( 180^\circ \).

Thus, the measure of \( m \angle H \) is calculated as:
\[ m \angle H = 180^\circ - 52^\circ - 26^\circ = 102^\circ \]

However, this value does not match any of the provided choices. Given the problem constraints and the choices available, it seems there might be a misinterpretation or error in the provided options or angles.
