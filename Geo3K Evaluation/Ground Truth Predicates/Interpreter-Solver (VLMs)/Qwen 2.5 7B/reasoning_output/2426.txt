QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve for \( x \), we need to understand the relationship between the two similar rectangles. The area of a rectangle scales with the square of the length of its sides because the area is proportional to the square of the linear dimensions of the shape.

Given:
- Area of smaller rectangle (\( A = 8 \text{ in}^2 \))
- Area of larger rectangle (\( A = 32 \text{ in}^2 \))
- Length of one side of the smaller rectangle is 4 inches.

Since the rectangles are similar, the ratio of their areas is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths. Let the length of the longer side of the smaller rectangle be \( y \). Thus, the ratio of the areas is:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)^2 = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]

Taking the square root of both sides gives:

\[
\frac{x}{y} = 2
\]

Since \( y = 4 \) (the known length of the smaller rectangle):

\[
\frac{x}{4} = 2 \implies x = 8
\]

Thus, the value of \( x \) is 8.
