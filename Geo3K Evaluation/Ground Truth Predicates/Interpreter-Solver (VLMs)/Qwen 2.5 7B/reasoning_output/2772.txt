QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's analyze the given information and deduce the measure of angle \( \widehat{XZ} \).

1. **Identify the given angles and points:**
   - Measure of angle \( \widehat{ZYX} = 68^\circ \).
   - Measure of arc \( \widehat{EWX} = 224^\circ \).
   - Point \( Z \) lies on line \( YE \).
   - Point \( X \) lies on line \( YB \).
   - Point \( E \) lies on line \( YD \).
   - Point \( Z \) lies on line \( YD \).
   - Point \( E \) lies on line \( ZD \).
   - Points \( X \), \( E \), and \( Z \) lie on circle \( C \).

2. **Understand the relationship between the arc and the central angle:**
   - Since the measure of arc \( \widehat{EWX} \) is \( 224^\circ \), the corresponding central angle \( \angle ECW \) is also \( 224^\circ \).

3. **Determine the measure of the inscribed angle \( \angle XEZ \):**
   - The inscribed angle \( \angle XEZ \) intercepts the arc \( \widehat{WXZ} \).
   - The measure of arc \( \widehat{WXZ} \) can be found by subtracting the measure of arc \( \widehat{EWX} \) from the full circle:
     \[
     \text{Measure of arc } \widehat{WXZ} = 360^\circ - 224^\circ = 136^\circ
     \]
   - Therefore, the measure of the inscribed angle \( \angle XEZ \) is half of the measure of the arc \( \widehat{WXZ} \):
     \[
     \text{Measure of } \angle XEZ = \frac{136^\circ}{2} = 68^\circ
     \]

4. **Determine the measure of angle \( \widehat{XZ} \):**
   - Since point \( Z \) lies on the line \( YD \) and forms a straight line with \( X \) and \( E \), the sum of angles \( \angle XEZ \) and \( \angle XZY \) should equal \( 180^\circ \).
   - Given \( \angle XEZ = 68^\circ \), we can find \( \angle XZY \):
     \[
     \angle XZY = 180^\circ - 68^\circ = 112^\circ
     \]

However, this does not directly give us the measure of \( \widehat{XZ} \). Instead, we need to consider the cyclic quadrilateral properties and the fact that \( \angle XZY \) is part of the triangle formed by the intersection of the lines.

Given the options and the problem constraints, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the cyclic nature and the angle relationships more carefully.

By the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the measure of the inscribed angle \( \angle XEZ \) should be half the measure of the arc it intercepts. Here, the arc \( \widehat{WXZ} \) measures \( 136^\circ \), so the inscribed angle \( \angle XEZ \) should be \( 68^\circ \).

Therefore, considering the cyclic property and the given angles, the correct measure of \( \widehat{XZ} \) is:
