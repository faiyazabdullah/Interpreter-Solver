To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of angles subtended by arcs in a circle. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The measure of angle \( \angle DAC = 218^\circ \).
   - Point \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \) lie on the circle with center \( A \).

2. **Understand the relationship between the angles:**
   - The angle \( \angle DAC \) is an arc angle subtended by arc \( DC \). Since the measure of \( \angle DAC \) is \( 218^\circ \), it means the arc \( DC \) subtends an angle of \( 218^\circ \).

3. **Calculate the remaining arc angle:**
   - The total measure of a circle is \( 360^\circ \).
   - Therefore, the measure of arc \( DB \) (which includes point \( B \)) can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Measure of arc } DB = 360^\circ - 218^\circ = 142^\circ
     \]

4. **Determine the inscribed angle \( \angle 1 \):**
   - Angle \( \angle 1 \) is an inscribed angle subtended by arc \( DB \).
   - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends.
   - Therefore, the measure of \( \angle 1 \) is:
     \[
     \text{Measure of } \angle 1 = \frac{142^\circ}{2} = 71^\circ
     \]

Since none of the provided choices match \( 71^\circ \), it seems there might be an error in the problem setup or the choices. However, based on the given choices, the closest possible answer would be:
