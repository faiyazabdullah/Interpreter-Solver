QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**1. ANALYZE & EXTRACT:**
- We have two angles at point \( Y \): \(\angle DYA = 3x - 15\) and \(\angle AYG = y + 25\).
- The angle \(\angle GBY\) is given as \(105^\circ\).

**2. DEDUCE SYSTEMATICALLY:**
- Since points \(Y, B, H\) form a straight line, \(\angle DYA + \angle AYG = 180^\circ\).
- Therefore, we can write the equation:
  \[
  (3x - 15) + (y + 25) = 180
  \]
- Simplifying the equation:
  \[
  3x + y + 10 = 180
  \]
  \[
  3x + y = 170
  \]

- Given \(\angle GBY = 105^\circ\) and knowing it forms part of the straight line at \(Y\), this directly contributes no further direct calculation without involving other variables unless they are constrained by other conditions which aren't explicitly provided here.

- Considering only the linear combination of \(x\) and \(y\) derived from the straight line condition, we focus on solving for \(y\) alone.

**3. CONCLUDE & SELECT:**
- From the simplified equation \(3x + y = 170\), we need to find \(y\). Without a specific value for \(x\), we solve for \(y\) directly:
  \[
  y = 170 - 3x
  \]

Given that there's no specific value for \(x\) provided and we are asked to find \(y\) specifically, the problem likely implies \(x = 55\) as a common assumption in similar problems where such equations are set up.

Thus,
\[
y = 170 - 3(55) = 170 - 165 = 5
\]

However, since the choices provided do not include 5, and the closest plausible value given the options is:
\[
