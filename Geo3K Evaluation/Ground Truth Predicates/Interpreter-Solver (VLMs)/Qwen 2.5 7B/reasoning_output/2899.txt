====================================================================================================
**1. ANALYZE & EXTRACT**
- We know that CW = WF because the figure shows two equal segments.
- The length of ED is given as 30.
- Since point F lies on line segment ED, and point C lies on line segment AB, we can infer that the circle's center W is equidistant from points A, B, C, and D due to the properties of a circle.
- Perpendiculars from W to lines CD and EF indicate right angles at those intersections.
- We need to find the length of DF.

**2. DEDUCE SYSTEMATICALLY**
- From the symmetry and equal distances, triangle EWF is congruent to triangle CWF by the properties of the circle and the given perpendiculars.
- Therefore, EF = CF.
- Since CW = WF and both are radii of the circle, triangle CWF is an isosceles triangle.
- Given that ED = 30, and considering the symmetry and equal segments, we can deduce that DF is half of ED.

**3. CONCLUDE & SELECT**
- Therefore, DF = ED / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.
- Hence, the final answer is:

Final Answer: A
