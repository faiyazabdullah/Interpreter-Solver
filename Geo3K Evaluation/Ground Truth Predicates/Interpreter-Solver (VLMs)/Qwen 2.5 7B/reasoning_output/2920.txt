====================================================================================================
**1. ANALYZE & EXTRACT**
- We have a trapezoid QRUT where V and S are midpoints of the legs QR and UT, respectively.
- Given QR = 4 and UT = 16.
- Midpoints of legs imply that VS is the median connecting the non-parallel sides, which is parallel to QR and UT and half their sum.

**2. DEDUCE SYSTEMATICALLY**
- Since V and S are midpoints, VS is the midsegment of trapezoid QRUT.
- The length of the midsegment of a trapezoid is given by the average of the lengths of the two bases.
- Therefore, VS = \(\frac{QR + UT}{2}\).

**Calculation:**
\[ VS = \frac{4 + 16}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

**CONCLUDE & SELECT**
- Final Answer: C
