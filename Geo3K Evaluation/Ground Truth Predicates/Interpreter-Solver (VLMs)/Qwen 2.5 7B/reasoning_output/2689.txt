QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the shape:** The figure appears to be a combination of two rectangles overlapping at right angles.
   
2. **Measure the dimensions:**
   - The length of segment \(BC\) is given as 5 units.
   - The length of segment \(AB\) is given as 2 units.
   - Since the figure forms a right angle overlap, the total horizontal length from \(A\) to \(C\) through \(B\) and the vertical length from \(H\) to \(E\) through \(G\) is the sum of these segments.

3. **Calculate the perimeter:**
   - The horizontal length \(AD\) plus the horizontal length \(DE\) equals 5 units each.
   - The vertical length \(AH\) plus the vertical length \(HE\) equals 5 units each.
   - The horizontal overlap length \(BF\) plus the vertical overlap length \(FG\) equals 2 units each.

Thus, the perimeter can be calculated by adding up all the sides:

\[ \text{Perimeter} = AD + DE + HE + EH + BF + FG + GH + HG \]

Given the lengths:
\[ AD = 5, DE = 5, HE = 5, EH = 5, BF = 2, FG = 2, GH = 2, HG = 2 \]

Summing them up:
\[ 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 26 \]

However, since the overlapping segments are subtracted out due to the right-angle intersection, we need to correct this:
\[ \text{Corrected Perimeter} = 2 \times (AD + DE) + 2 \times (HE + EH) = 2 \times (5 + 5) + 2 \times (5 + 5) = 2 \times 10 + 2 \times 10 = 40 / 2 = 20 \]

Final Answer: A
