The image shows a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle. The vertices of the hexagon are J, K, L, M, N, and P. The center of the circle is R. A central angle is an angle formed by two radii of the circle. For example, angle KRL is a central angle. Since the hexagon is regular, the central angles are all equal. Also, the sum of the central angles is 360 degrees. There are 6 equal central angles in this figure. Therefore, the measure of each central angle is 360/6 = 60 degrees.
