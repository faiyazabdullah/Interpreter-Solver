Let the circle be tangent to AB at A and BC at C.
Since tangents from a point to a circle have equal length, BA = BC. Thus, triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle with BA = BC = 3x. Let AE = CE = r, where r is the radius of the circle. Also, the perimeter of triangle ABC is given by AB + BC + AC = 25.

Since tangents from the same point to a circle are equal in length, we have BA = BC = 3x. Since AC is a secant, we can't directly apply tangent properties.
Also, it seems we are given that AC is a diameter of the circle.
Therefore, AE = EC. Let AE = EC = y. Thus AC = 2y.
The perimeter is AB + BC + AC = 3x + 3x + 2y = 6x + 2y = 25.

Since we can't determine y from the figure, let's assume the problem meant that AB and BC are tangents from point B to the circle. Let AB = BC = 3x.
Since we are given that AC is a diameter, then AE = EC = r.
Also, perimeter = AB + BC + AC = 25.
3x + 3x + 2r = 25
6x + 2r = 25
However, this equation alone is not enough to solve for x.

However, if the circle is tangent to AB at A and BC at C, then BA = BC = 3x. Also, we need information about AC.
It is given that the perimeter of the triangle ABC is 25. So, AB + BC + AC = 25. Substituting AB = BC = 3x, we get 3x + 3x + AC = 25. Therefore, 6x + AC = 25.
However, without more information, we can't determine AC as a function of x.
Therefore, there must be a way to express AC in terms of x.

If A and C are points of tangency and AC is a diameter of the circle, then we know that angles BAC and BCA are equal. We can then say that $\angle BAC = \angle BCA$.
Since $BA = BC$, we know that triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle with $\angle BAC = \angle BCA$.
Since $AC$ is a diameter, $E$ is the center of the circle. $EA \perp BA$ and $EC \perp BC$. $\angle BAE = 90$ and $\angle BCE = 90$.

$AB + BC + AC = 25$, so $3x + 3x + AC = 25$
$6x + AC = 25$

There isn't enough information to determine x.
Since AB and BC are tangent, $\triangle ABE$ and $\triangle CBE$ are right triangles. Also since A, E, C are collinear and form the diameter of the circle, then A, E, C are on the same line.
If we examine each choice, if x=3, then AB = BC = 9, so AC = 25 - 18 = 7.
if x=6, then AB = BC = 18, so AC = 25 - 36 = -11.
if x=7, then AB = BC = 21, so AC = 25 - 42 = -17.
If x=9, then AB = BC = 27, so AC = 25 - 54 = -29.

The circle in the figure looks like it is tangent to AB at A and BC at C.
