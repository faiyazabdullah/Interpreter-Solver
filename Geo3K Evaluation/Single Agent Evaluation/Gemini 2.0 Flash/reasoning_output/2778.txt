Let's analyze the given geometric figure. We have a circle with two secants drawn from an external point T. One secant is T-W-X, and the other is T-Y-Z.
We are given TW = 7, WX = 12, and TY = 6. We need to find YZ = x.

According to the secant-secant power theorem, the product of one secant's external segment and its total length is equal to the product of the other secant's external segment and its total length.

In our case, the theorem can be expressed as:
TW * TX = TY * TZ

We know TW = 7 and WX = 12, so TX = TW + WX = 7 + 12 = 19.
We are given TY = 6. Let YZ = x, so TZ = TY + YZ = 6 + x.

Now, plug in the values into the equation:
7 * 19 = 6 * (6 + x)
133 = 36 + 6x
6x = 133 - 36
6x = 97
x = 97 / 6

Thus, x = 97 / 6.

Now, let's compare our calculated result with the given answer choices:
A. 72/7 ≈ 10.29
B. 14
C. 95/6 ≈ 15.83
D. 97/6 ≈ 16.17

Our calculated value for x is 97/6, which corresponds to option D.

Final Answer: D
