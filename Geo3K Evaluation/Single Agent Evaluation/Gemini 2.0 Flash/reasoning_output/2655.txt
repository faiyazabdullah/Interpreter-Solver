====================================================================================================
The figure is a square, and the diagonal divides the square into two right triangles. The angle y is one of the angles in the right triangle. Since the triangle is formed from a square, the two sides are equal, making it an isosceles triangle. In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are equal. Since one angle is 90 degrees, the sum of the other two angles is 90 degrees. Since the other two angles are equal, each angle is 45 degrees. Therefore, angle y is 45 degrees.
