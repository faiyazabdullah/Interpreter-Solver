Given trapezoid QRST, where A and B are midpoints of the legs, and angle T is 120 degrees and angle R is 45 degrees.
We are asked to find the measure of angle S.
Since QRST is a trapezoid, we know that sides TS and QR are parallel.
Also, A and B are midpoints of the legs TQ and SR, so AB is the midsegment of the trapezoid.
Since AB is the midsegment, AB is parallel to TS and QR.
Given that angle T is 120 degrees and angle R is 45 degrees.
The sum of the angles in a quadrilateral is 360 degrees. So, angle T + angle Q + angle R + angle S = 360.
Since TS is parallel to QR, angle T and angle Q are supplementary, so angle T + angle Q = 180.
Therefore, angle Q = 180 - angle T = 180 - 120 = 60 degrees.
Also, since TS is parallel to QR, angle S and angle R are supplementary, so angle S + angle R = 180.
Therefore, angle S = 180 - angle R = 180 - 45 = 135 degrees.
Thus, the measure of angle S is 135 degrees.
