From the image, HS || JR || KQ || LP.
Therefore, triangle HMS is similar to triangle LKM.
By similar triangles, we have the following ratios:
HS / LP = SR / PM = HR / HL
Let's consider the lengths of the segments.
We are given LK = 4, MP = 3, PQ = 6, KJ = 2, RS = 6, LP = 2.
Also, we are looking for ML.
Let ML = x.
Also, since HS || JR || KQ || LP, we have similar triangles HMS and LKM.
Therefore, we have LK / HK = PM / SM.
Since the segments are parallel, we have HJ / HL = QR / SM = JK / KL = PQ / RM.
We have JK / KL = 2/4 = 1/2.
PQ / RM = 6 / RM, so 6 / RM = 1/2. Therefore, RM = 12.
Since RS = 6 and RM = 12, SM = RS + RM = 6 + 12 = 18.
Then, we have LP / HS = MP / RS = ML / HL.
We also have triangle PKL similar to triangle SMR.
We know that HS || JR || KQ || LP. Therefore, HL / HM = LP / SM.
Consider MP / SM = 3 / 18 = 1/6. Thus, LK / HS = MP / RS.
We have LP / HS = MP / SR. So LP / SR = 2/6 = 1/3.
Since LK = 4, MP = 3, PQ = 6, L P = 2, R S = 6, and K J = 2.
The line through L is parallel.
We have LP / SM = LK / SH.
Consider triangle MHS and line LKP.
Then M L / L H = M P / P Q = 3 / 6 = 1 / 2.
So if M L = x, then L H = 2 x.
Since L K = 4, M L / K J = L P / J R
L K = 4, L P = 2, K J = 2, M P = 3
M P / P Q = 3 / 6 = 1 / 2.
M L / LK = M P / PQ => L K (M P / P Q)
M L = M P = 3.
Therefore M L / LK = MP / PQ
3 / 4 = 3/6.  Which is impossible.

Since the lines are parallel, we have the relation ML / LK = MP / PQ. We have the relation for the parallel lines.
ML / LK = MP / PQ = > ML / 4 = 3 / 6 = > ML = 4(3/6) => ML = 2.
