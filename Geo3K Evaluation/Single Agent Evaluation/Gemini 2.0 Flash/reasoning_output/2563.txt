In parallelogram JKLM, we are given that angle MLK is 30 degrees, and angle JKL is 70 degrees. We want to find angle KJL.

Since JKLM is a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, and consecutive angles are supplementary.
Thus, angle JML = angle JKL = 70 degrees. Also, angle JKL + angle KLM = 180 degrees, so 70 + angle KLM = 180, which means angle KLM = 110 degrees.
We are given that angle MLK = 30 degrees. Therefore, in triangle MKL, angle KML = 180 - (angle MLK + angle MKL) = 180 - (30 + 70) = 180 - 100 = 80 degrees.

Also, since JK is parallel to ML, angle KJL = angle JLM (alternate interior angles).
We know angle KLM = 110 degrees, and angle MLK = 30 degrees.
Since JK is parallel to ML, angle KML + angle JKM = 180 degrees, where angle JKM is not labeled.
We are looking for angle KJL. In triangle JKL, we know angle JKL = 70 degrees. Also, JK is parallel to ML, so angle MLK = 30. In parallelogram JKLM, sides JK = ML and JM = KL.
Since JK is parallel to ML, m < KJL = m < JLM, where angle JLM is made of two triangles.  In triangle MRL, m < RML = 30.
Consider the triangle formed by the intersection of the diagonals. Since the angles at point L add to m < KJL = JLM, we should consider angle JLK=30 and JML is unknown
We also have KL = ML, which can then be related to the side JM, so they are also related.

We know that consecutive angles in a parallelogram are supplementary.  Therefore, angle J + angle K = 180, and angle K + angle L = 180. Angle J = angle L and angle K = angle M.
Then m < J = 180 - 70 = 110. m < L = 110. Also m < M = 70
m < MLK = 30. Also m < JKL = 70.
So in Triangle JKL, m < JKL = 70, then m < JLK = 30
So m < KJL = 180 - 70 - 30 = 80. However, sides need to be compared to see if their values match up.
The measure of angle JML is 30. Then m<JML + m <JLM =110.
So m < JLM = 80.
In triangle JKL, the angles are m < KJL, m < JKL and m < JLK. In the question
we have JKL is a parellogram, and angles adjacent to KL are 70 degrees at K, and 30 degrees at L
Since m < MLK=30, and m < JLM = 30, then we have 180 - 30- m < JKL = m < KJL=180-30-m < JKL
so angle J + K = 180.
JK is parallel to ML, so m < KJL = JLM. m < JLM + KML are known to find m < MLK =30
Consider that in JKLM JK = 45 and 2b+3. m < KLM = 110, and since its also m < KJL =m < KLM
70+30 =100

We have the following m < MLK=30, m < KJL=?. Using m <MLK=30 at MLK, since
m < MRL=2m. So m< KJL =180-(70+30) since JK parallels ML,
m< JLM = m < KJL.
m < JKL=70, so using what we were given, the measure of angle KJL=angle KJL=180-70- 30-80
But m< KJL+mLJM needs to match so using it is more reliable. Then M
Consider angle K, which measures 70=angle K since it
So m=180 then 80 should not be true. since it is 180-(sum of
Since angle KLM = 110 and angle JKL = 70. m angle JLM is made of alternate interior anglse is 30 by parallel. JML + JLM = mL. mL+
So JLM=30
Then it is more reasonable if M < L =

Since < JKL = 70 degrees
 < L = 110
 < MLK = 30,  so < KLJ must be 110-30 = 80
