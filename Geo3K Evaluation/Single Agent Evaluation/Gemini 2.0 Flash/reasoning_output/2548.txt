Since quadrilateral DEFG is a rectangle, all its angles are right angles. Also, the diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other. Therefore, triangle DFG is a right triangle, with m \angle D G F = 90 degrees. The sum of angles in triangle DFG is 180 degrees.
Given that m \angle E D F = 5 x - 3 and m \angle D F G = 3 x + 7. Also, since DEFG is a rectangle, m \angle DFG + m \angle EDF = 90.
Since DEFG is a rectangle, m \angle G = 90 degrees.
Therefore,
m \angle D F G + m \angle D E F + m \angle E D G + m \angle F G D = 360
Since DEFG is a rectangle, m \angle EDF + m \angle DFG = 90
Therefore,
(5x - 3) + (3x + 7) = 90
8x + 4 = 90
8x = 86
x = 86/8 = 43/4 = 10.75
m \angle E D F = 5 x - 3 = 5 * (43/4) - 3 = (215/4) - (12/4) = 203/4 = 50.75
However, we know that in a rectangle the angle between the side and the diagonal is not 90 degrees.
In rectangle DEFG, m \angle D = m \angle E = m \angle F = m \angle G = 90 degrees.
We are given that m \angle EDF = 5x - 3 and m \angle DFG = 3x + 7.
Also, m \angle EDF + m \angle DFG = 90
Therefore, (5x - 3) + (3x + 7) = 90
8x + 4 = 90
8x = 86
x = 86/8 = 43/4 = 10.75
m \angle EDF = 5x - 3 = 5(10.75) - 3 = 53.75 - 3 = 50.75
Also, m \angle DFG = 3x + 7 = 3(10.75) + 7 = 32.25 + 7 = 39.25
m \angle EDF + m \angle DFG = 50.75 + 39.25 = 90
However, the above values of x and the angle do not match any of the answer choices.

Instead, we can say that angle EDG + angle EDF = 90
So angle EDG = 90 - EDF = 90 - (5x-3)
Also, angle DFG + angle GFE = 90
So angle GFE = 90 - DFG = 90 - (3x+7)
Given that DEFG is a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other.
This implies that triangles are congruent.
Therefore EDF = DFG
5x - 3 = 3x + 7
2x = 10
x = 5
m \angle EDF = 5(5) - 3 = 25 - 3 = 22
