D. 52

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

Let the length of one diagonal of the rhombus be $d_1$ and the length of the other diagonal be $d_2$. We are given that one diagonal is twice as long as the other diagonal, so we can write $d_1 = 2d_2$ or $d_2 = 2d_1$. Let's assume $d_1 = 2d_2$.
The area of a rhombus is given by the formula $A = \frac{1}{2} d_1 d_2$. We are given that the area is 169 square millimeters.
Substituting the given information into the area formula, we have:
$169 = \frac{1}{2} (2d_2) d_2$
$169 = d_2^2$
Taking the square root of both sides, we get $d_2 = \sqrt{169} = 13$.
Then, $d_1 = 2d_2 = 2(13) = 26$.
Thus, the lengths of the diagonals are 13 and 26 millimeters.
Alternatively, assume $d_2 = 2d_1$.
$169 = \frac{1}{2} d_1 (2d_1)$
$169 = d_1^2$
$d_1 = 13$
Then $d_2 = 2d_1 = 2(13) = 26$
Thus, the lengths of the diagonals are 13 and 26 millimeters.

The lengths of the diagonals are 13 and 26.
