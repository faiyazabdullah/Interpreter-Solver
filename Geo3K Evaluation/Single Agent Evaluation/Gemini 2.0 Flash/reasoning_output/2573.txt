Let's analyze the figure. We are asked to find the measure of angle 1.

Angle 1 and angle ECH are vertically opposite angles. Therefore, they are equal in measure.
The sum of angles around point C is 360 degrees. We know that the angle between CF and CB is 90 degrees because angle DBA is 90 degrees and they are corresponding angles. Therefore, m \angle FCE = 90. Angle ECH is a straight line, so m \angle ECH = m \angle FCE. Since CF is not parallel to DB, therefore those angles are not actually equal. Instead, \angle 1 + \angle FCB = 180.

Since angles FCB and DBA are corresponding angles, and lines FC and DB are not parallel, we have \angle FCB not necessarily equal to 90.
Instead, we can say that \angle FCB + \angle 1 = 180.

Since the angles around point A add up to 360, let the angle between AG and AD be x. Then x + 157 = 180.
x = 180 - 157 = 23.

Let's examine angle 1.
Assume the line CE is parallel to GA and CF is parallel to AD. Then \angle 1 would be equal to 157. But that is not possible.
We are told that \angle DBA = 90. Therefore, \angle DBG = 180 - 90 = 90.

Because angles 1 and HCE are vertical, \angle 1 = \angle HCE.
Without more information, it's not possible to determine \angle 1. However, if the lines HB and FI are parallel, then we can figure out the corresponding angles.
Without that, we can assume from the answer choices that we have to approximate it.

It looks to be approximately 123.
