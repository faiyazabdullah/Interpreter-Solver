From the figure, it appears that triangle PTQ and triangle SQR are similar triangles. We can write the ratio of corresponding sides as follows:
PT / SR = TQ / QR = PQ / SQ
Substituting the given values, we have:
3 / (3+x) = 3 / (6+x) = (6-x) / (3+x)
From the first equality, we can write:
3 / (3+x) = 3 / (6+x)
Multiplying both sides by (3+x)(6+x), we get:
3(6+x) = 3(3+x)
18 + 3x = 9 + 3x
18 = 9
This is a contradiction, which means the triangles are not similar.

However, if we consider PT / SQ = TQ / QR
3 / (3+x) = 3 / (6+x)
Again, multiplying both sides by (3+x)(6+x), we get:
3(6+x) = 3(3+x)
18 + 3x = 9 + 3x
18 = 9, which is impossible.

Let's instead focus on the information that TQ = 3. Assume that PQ = x. Then PT = 6 - x. Now, suppose we are given that TQ/QR = PT/SR. Then we have
3/(6+x) = (6-x)/(3+x)
3(3+x) = (6-x)(6+x)
9 + 3x = 36 - x^2
x^2 + 3x - 27 = 0
x = (-3 +/- sqrt(9 + 4*27)) / 2 = (-3 +/- sqrt(117)) / 2
This is not an integer.

Consider PQ = 4. Then 6-x = 2.
Then 3 / (6+x) = (6-x) / (3+x) becomes
3 / 10 = 2 / 7 which is false.

However, we are given that PQ = 6-x. Hence PQ + x = 6. We are trying to find PQ.

Let's look for a clue that we missed. The little arrows suggest that PT is parallel to SR. If that is the case, then triangles PTQ and RSQ are similar triangles. Then we can use the ratios of sides.
PQ/QR = PT/RS = TQ/QS
PQ/(6+x) = (6-x)/(3+x) = 3/(3+x)
From (6-x)/(3+x) = 3/(3+x), we have 6-x = 3 which implies x = 3.
Therefore PQ = 6-3 = 3.
