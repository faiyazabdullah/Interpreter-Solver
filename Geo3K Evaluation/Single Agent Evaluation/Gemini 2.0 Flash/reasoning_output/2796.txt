The measure of angle $W$ is given as 49 degrees. The measure of angle $YBX$ is given as 96 degrees. Angle $W$ is formed by the intersection of chords $WX$ and $WY$ outside the circle. The measure of angle $W$ is half the difference of the intercepted arcs $\widehat{YX}$ and $\widehat{XZ}$. Thus, $m\angle W = \frac{1}{2} (m\widehat{YX} - m\widehat{XZ})$. We are given that $m\angle W = 49$, so $49 = \frac{1}{2} (m\widehat{YX} - m\widehat{XZ})$, which means $98 = m\widehat{YX} - m\widehat{XZ}$.

Also, the measure of the inscribed angle $YBX$ is half the measure of the intercepted arc $\widehat{YX}$. Therefore, $m\widehat{YX} = 2 \cdot m\angle YBX = 2(96) = 192$.
Since $98 = m\widehat{YX} - m\widehat{XZ}$, we have $98 = 192 - m\widehat{XZ}$, so $m\widehat{XZ} = 192 - 98 = 94$.
We are looking for $m\widehat{YXZ}$. This is the arc formed by going from $Y$ to $X$ to $Z$. This is equal to $m\widehat{YX} + m\widehat{XZ} = 192 + 94 = 286$. However, this is not one of the answer choices.
It is possible that the intended question was to find the measure of arc $\widehat{YZX}$, the larger arc from $Y$ through $Z$ to $X$. In this case, the requested arc is $360 - \widehat{XY} = 360 - 192 = 168$. Since angle $YBX$ is given as 96 degrees, this cannot be right.
The question asks for the measure of arc $\widehat{YXZ}$. This is the measure of arc $\widehat{YX}$ plus the measure of arc $\widehat{XZ}$, or $192 + 94 = 286$.
The reflex angle $YBX = 360 - 96 = 264$. Half of this is $132$. Then $m\widehat{YXZ} = 192 + 94 = 286$.
$49 = \frac{1}{2} (m\widehat{YX} - m\widehat{XZ})$. Then $98 = m\widehat{YX} - m\widehat{XZ}$. $m\widehat{YX} = 192$, so $98 = 192 - m\widehat{XZ}$. Then $m\widehat{XZ} = 192 - 98 = 94$. We seek to find $m\widehat{YXZ} = 360 - m\widehat{YZ}$. We have $m\widehat{YX} + m\widehat{XZ} = 192 + 94 = 286$.
Then $360 - 286 = 74$. The answer is $\frac{1}{2}(192 - 94) = \frac{98}{2} = 49$. The angle $W$ is 49 degrees. We want to find $m\widehat{YXZ}$.
If we assume $m\widehat{YXZ} = 194$, then $m\widehat{YZ} = 360 - 194 = 166$. $m\widehat{YX} + m\widehat{XZ} = 192 + 94 = 286$, so we do not have an arc of 194 degrees.
We wish to find $m\widehat{YXZ}$. This is $m\widehat{YX} + m\widehat{XZ} = 192 + 94 = 286$. But none of these are right. $m\widehat{XYZ} = 360 - m\widehat{ZY} = 360 - y$. We know $m \widehat{XZ}$ = 94.
