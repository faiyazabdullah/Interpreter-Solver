The sum of the angles in triangle ABC is 180 degrees.
Therefore, angle ABC = 180 - 70 - 40 = 70 degrees.

Since angle ABC = 70 degrees and angle 2 = 45 degrees, then angle 1 = 180 - (45 + 70) = 65 degrees.

The sum of the angles on a straight line is 180 degrees. Therefore, angle ADB + angle 3 = 180 degrees.
Also, the sum of the angles in triangle ABD is 180 degrees. Therefore, angle 3 + 40 degrees + angle ABD = 180 degrees.

In triangle BCD, angle C is 70 degrees and angle 2 is 45 degrees. Thus angle 1 is 180 - 70 - 45 = 65 degrees.

In triangle ABD, angle A is 40 degrees. Angle ABD is 180 - 45 = 135 degrees. Angle 3 = 180 - (40 + 135) = 180 - 175 = 5 degrees.
This doesn't make sense.

Angle ABC = 180 - 40 - 70 = 70 degrees.
Angle 2 = 45 degrees. So Angle ABD = 70 - 45 = 25 degrees.
So Angle 3 = 180 - 40 - 25 = 115 degrees.

Consider triangle BCD. Angle C is 70 degrees, and angle 2 is 45 degrees.
Angle 1 is not an interior angle. It is supplementary to BDA.
Angle CDB is 180 - angle 3.

In triangle ABD, angle A is 40 degrees, angle ABD is 45 degrees.
Angle ADB is 180 - 40 - 45 = 95 degrees.
Therefore angle 3 = 180 - 95 = 85 degrees.
This doesn't seem right.

The sum of angles in triangle ABC is 180 degrees, so $\angle ABC = 180 - 70 - 40 = 70^{\circ}$.
Since $\angle ABC = \angle ACB = 70^{\circ}$, triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle, so $AB = AC$.
Let $\angle CBD = 45^{\circ}$. Then $\angle ABD = 70 - 45 = 25^{\circ}$.
Then, in triangle ABD, $\angle ADB = 180 - 40 - 25 = 115^{\circ}$.
Since $\angle ADB + \angle 3 = 180^{\circ}$, we have $\angle 3 = 180 - 115 = 65^{\circ}$.

Let $\angle 1$ be $\angle CDB$, then $\angle 3 = 180 - \angle 1$.
We have $\angle ABC = 180 - 70 - 40 = 70^{\circ}$. $\angle ABD = \angle ABC - 45^{\circ} = 70^{\circ} - 45^{\circ} = 25^{\circ}$.
$\angle ADB = 180^{\circ} - \angle A - \angle ABD = 180^{\circ} - 40^{\circ} - 25^{\circ} = 115^{\circ}$.
Then $\angle 3 = 180^{\circ} - 115^{\circ} = 65^{\circ}$.

Given the angles A=40, ACB=70, CBD=45, we can find angle ABC to be 180-40-70 = 70. This means ABC is isosceles and AB = AC
Angle ABD = 70-45 = 25. So now in triangle ABD, we have two angles 40, 25 so the third is 180-40-25 = 115
This means angle 3 must be 180-115 = 65. But this is not an option.

$\angle ABC = 180 - 40 - 70 = 70^{\circ}$. Therefore triangle ABC is isosceles with AB=AC
Also, $\angle ABD = 70 - 45 = 25^{\circ}$
So, $\angle ADB = 180 - 40 - 25 = 115^{\circ}$.
Therefore, $\angle 3 = 180 - 115 = 65^{\circ}$.

However, we are given only the above information, and no side lengths.
If $\angle 3 = 95^{\circ}$, then $\angle ADB = 180 - 95 = 85^{\circ}$
In triangle ABD, $\angle ABD = 180 - 40 - 85 = 55^{\circ}$
Then $\angle ABC = 45 + 55 = 100^{\circ}$
But then $\angle A + \angle B + \angle C = 40 + 100 + 70 = 210^{\circ}$ which is too big.

If we let $\angle 3 = 85$, then $\angle ADB = 180 - 85 = 95^{\circ}$.
Then $\angle ABD = 180 - 40 - 95 = 45^{\circ}$
Then $\angle ABC = 45 + 45 = 90$.
Then $40 + 70 + 90 = 200$.
