QUESTION:
Find x to the nearest tenth. Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent.

CHOICES:
A. 5
B. 8.1
C. 10.3
D. 21.6

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's analyze the circle. We are given that DG = 8.1, GE = 10.3, and EB = 17. We need to find the length of EX, which we denote as x. According to the intersecting chords theorem, the product of the segments of one chord is equal to the product of the segments of the other chord. In this case, we have (DG)(GE) = (BE)(EX), so (8.1)(10.3) = (17)(x).
Thus, x = (8.1 * 10.3) / 17
x = 83.43 / 17
x ≈ 4.9076
Rounding to the nearest tenth, x ≈ 4.9

The closest option to 4.9 is A.
