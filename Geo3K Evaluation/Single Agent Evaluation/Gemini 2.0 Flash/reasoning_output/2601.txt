The given image shows two triangles, $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle AED$. We are given that $AB = 3$, $BC = 5$, $ED = 3$, and $CD = 3.5$. We are also told that $BE \parallel CD$. Since $BE \parallel CD$, we have that $\triangle ABE \sim \triangle ACD$. Thus, the sides are proportional. We have $\frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{AE}{AD} = \frac{BE}{CD}$.
Since $AC = AB + BC = 3 + 5 = 8$, we have
$\frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{3}{8}$.
We are also given that $ED = 3$. Let $AE = y$, so $AD = AE + ED = y + 3$.
Therefore, $\frac{AE}{AD} = \frac{y}{y+3} = \frac{3}{8}$.
Cross-multiplying, we have $8y = 3(y+3)$, so $8y = 3y + 9$, which means $5y = 9$, so $y = \frac{9}{5} = 1.8$.
Then $AD = y + 3 = 1.8 + 3 = 4.8$.
However, if we let $BE = x$, then $\frac{BE}{CD} = \frac{x}{3.5} = \frac{3}{8}$. So $x = \frac{3}{8} \cdot 3.5 = \frac{10.5}{8} = \frac{21}{16}$.
Also, since $\triangle ABE \sim \triangle ACD$,
$\frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{AE}{AD}$
$\frac{3}{8} = \frac{AE}{AE + 3}$
$3(AE + 3) = 8AE$
$3AE + 9 = 8AE$
$5AE = 9$
$AE = \frac{9}{5} = 1.8$
$AD = AE + ED = 1.8 + 3 = 4.8$.

The question asks us to find $AD$, which we found to be $4.8$. However, this does not match any of the possible choices, so we must have made a mistake.

Looking closely at the diagram, we see that $\angle ABE$ and $\angle ACD$ are marked congruent. $\angle AEB$ and $\angle ADC$ are marked congruent. Thus $\triangle ABE \sim \triangle ACD$ by AA similarity. Therefore $\frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{AE}{AD} = \frac{BE}{CD}$.

$AC = AB + BC = 3 + 5 = 8$
$AD = AE + ED = AE + 3$
Thus $\frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{3}{8} = \frac{AE}{AE+3}$
$3(AE+3) = 8AE$
$3AE + 9 = 8AE$
$5AE = 9$
$AE = \frac{9}{5} = 1.8$
Then $AD = AE+ED = 1.8+3 = 4.8$

The possible answers are:
A. 5.5
B. 6
C. 7.5
D. 9

If we assume that $\frac{BC}{CD} = \frac{5}{3.5} = \frac{10}{7} = \frac{AE}{ED} = \frac{AE}{3}$.
Then $AE = \frac{30}{7} \approx 4.28$
$AD = AE + ED = \frac{30}{7} + 3 = \frac{30+21}{7} = \frac{51}{7} \approx 7.28$

However, the closest answer choice to $4.8$ is A. 5.5.

Final Answer: A
