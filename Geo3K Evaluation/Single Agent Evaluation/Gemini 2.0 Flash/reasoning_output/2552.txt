Let's analyze the figure to determine which segments are parallel.

We are given the following angles:
- Angle DAE = 60 degrees
- Angle AED = 40 degrees
- Angle BEA = 80 degrees
- Angle EBC = 60 degrees
- Angle BEC = 60 degrees
- Angle ABE = 70 degrees

First, consider the triangle BEC. Angle BEC is 60 degrees and Angle EBC is 60 degrees. Therefore, Angle BCE = 180 - 60 - 60 = 60 degrees. This means triangle BEC is equilateral.

Now, let's look for parallel lines. For AD and BE to be parallel, the alternate interior angles must be equal. However, we don't have enough information to determine this.

Let's check if AD and BC are parallel.
Angle ADE is not given, and we don't have enough information to find it.

Now let's analyze if AE and BC are parallel.
For AE and BC to be parallel, angle BEC should be equal to angle AEB, which means they should both be equal to 60 degrees. However, AEB is 80 degrees, and BEC is 60 degrees. Thus, AE and BC are not parallel.

Let's check if AB and CD are parallel. Angle BAC is 180 - (70+80) = 30. Angle CDA needs to be calculated. In triangle ADE, the third angle ADE can be calculated by 180-(60+40) = 80. AB and CD are not parallel.

Since the triangle BEC is equilateral, then BC = BE = EC. Also angle BEC = angle BCE = angle EBC = 60
The line DEC is a straight line. Hence angle BEA + angle BEC = 180. Therefore, 80 + angle CEB = 180 and angle CEB = 100. This does not correspond to the figure. Angle DEC = 180. 40 +80 + 60 = 180. This confirms E is indeed a point on the line DC.

Consider the figure. It looks like AD is not parallel to BC, so option B is wrong.
AB is not parallel to CD, so option A is wrong.

However, AD and BE look like they might be parallel.
If AD is parallel to BE, then Angle ADE and Angle DEB should be supplementary, which means their sum should be 180. We know Angle DEB= 180, so we can conclude that that AD and BC are not parallel.

Let us examine option C. We need to check if AD and BE are parallel. If AD and BE are parallel, then angle ADE+angle DEB=180. Where angle ADE = 80 and angle DEB = 120 (angle BEA+ angle ABE). Hence it's not supplementary. Therefore AD and BE are not parallel.

Based on the information given, there are no parallel lines. However, from a visual perspective, it seems AD is the closest to being parallel to BE.
