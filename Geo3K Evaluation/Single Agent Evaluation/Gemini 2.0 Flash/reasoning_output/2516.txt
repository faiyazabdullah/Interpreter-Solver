The problem states that \triangle RSV \cong \triangle TVS. This means the corresponding angles of the two triangles are equal.

In \triangle RSV, \angle RVS = 78^\circ. Since the triangles are congruent, the corresponding angle in \triangle TVS must be \angle VTS = 78^\circ. But we are given that \angle VTS = x^\circ. However, based on the diagram, it is more likely that \angle VTS = x^\circ is opposite to SV. Thus, \angle TVS corresponds to \angle RSV and \angle VTS corresponds to \angle VRS. Therefore, the diagram is incorrect.

Since \triangle RSV \cong \triangle TVS, we know that RS = TV. Thus, 2y - 1 = 24.
Also, SV = SV. And RV = TS, so RV = 24.5.
In triangle TVS, TV = 24, SV = SV, TS = 24.5.
In triangle RSV, RS = 24, SV = SV, RV = 24.5.
Since \triangle RSV \cong \triangle TVS, \angle RSV = \angle TVS, \angle SVR = \angle VST, and \angle VRS = \angle VTS.
We are given that \angle RVS = 78^\circ, and we are told to find x where x = \angle VTS.
So the sum of the angles in triangle TVS is 180^\circ.
So \angle TVS + \angle VST + \angle VTS = 180^\circ.
We know \angle VTS = x. And \angle RSV is a right angle, which means \angle TVS must also be a right angle. So \angle TVS = 90^\circ.
Also, SV is perpendicular to RT, thus, \angle RSV = \angle SVT = 90^\circ.
\angle RSV = 90^\circ, then \angle R + \angle RVS = 90^\circ.
\angle R + 78^\circ = 90^\circ.
\angle R = 12^\circ.
Since \triangle RSV \cong \triangle TVS, we have \angle R = \angle VTS = x = 12^\circ.
