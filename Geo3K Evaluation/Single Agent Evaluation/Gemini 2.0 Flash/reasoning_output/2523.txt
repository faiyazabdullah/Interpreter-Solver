B. 3
C. 5
D. 6

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

The polygons are similar, so the ratios of corresponding sides must be equal.
The side lengths of the smaller rectangle are x and x-2.
The side lengths of the larger rectangle are x+7.5 and 5.

The ratio of side lengths of the smaller rectangle is x/(x-2).
The ratio of side lengths of the larger rectangle is (x+7.5)/5.
Since the rectangles are similar, we can write the proportion x/5 = (x-2)/(x+7.5)

We can also consider the proportion:
x / (x-2) = (x+7.5) / 5
Cross-multiplying, we get:
5x = (x-2)(x+7.5)
5x = x^2 + 7.5x - 2x - 15
5x = x^2 + 5.5x - 15
0 = x^2 + 0.5x - 15

Using the quadratic formula:
x = (-b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
x = (-0.5 +/- sqrt(0.5^2 - 4(1)(-15))) / 2(1)
x = (-0.5 +/- sqrt(0.25 + 60)) / 2
x = (-0.5 +/- sqrt(60.25)) / 2
x = (-0.5 +/- 7.762) / 2
x = (-0.5 + 7.762) / 2 or x = (-0.5 - 7.762) / 2
x = 7.262 / 2 or x = -8.262 / 2
x = 3.631 or x = -4.131
Since x represents a side length, it must be positive. So, x = 3.631.

However, we also have the ratio x/5 = (x-2)/(x+7.5)
x(x+7.5) = 5(x-2)
x^2 + 7.5x = 5x - 10
x^2 + 2.5x + 10 = 0
x= (-2.5 +- sqrt(6.25-40)/2
No real solution

Let us check the ratios the other way.
(x-2)/x = 5/(x+7.5)
(x-2)(x+7.5) = 5x
x^2 +7.5x-2x-15 = 5x
x^2+0.5x-15 = 0
x=3.63
We want to round this to the closest answer from the options. The closest integer is 3

If x=3, then
AB=3, AD=x-2=1, EE=5, DG=7.5
AD= 1, AG=3+7.5=10.5
The ratios are
AD/AG = 1/10.5 = 2/21
AB/EF = 3/5
Not similar.

Let's try x = 5
Smaller rectangle is AB=5, AD=3
Larger Rectangle sides are 5+7.5=12.5 and 5
The ratios are
3/5 and 5/12.5 = 50/125=2/5
They are not similar.

Lets try x=6
Smaller is AD=4, AB=6
Larger is 5 and 6+7.5 = 13.5
4/5 and 6/13.5 = 60/135 = 12/27 = 4/9
