QUESTION:
Cut four congruent triangles off the corners of a rectangle to make an octagon. What is the area of the octagon?

CHOICES:
A. 456
B. 528
C. 552
D. 564

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The rectangle has dimensions 20 cm and 30 cm.
The area of the rectangle is $20 \times 30 = 600 \text{ cm}^2$.
The triangles cut off at the corners are congruent right-angled triangles. The legs of each triangle are both 6 cm.
The area of each triangle is $\frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times 6 = \frac{1}{2} \times 36 = 18 \text{ cm}^2$.
Since there are four such triangles, the total area of the four triangles is $4 \times 18 = 72 \text{ cm}^2$.
The area of the octagon is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the four triangles.
So, the area of the octagon is $600 - 72 = 528 \text{ cm}^2$.
