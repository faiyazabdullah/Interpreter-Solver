Since CG is a diameter, angle CBG is a straight angle, thus measuring 180 degrees. Similarly, since AD is a diameter, angle ABD is a straight angle, thus measuring 180 degrees.
We are given that angle CBF is 35 degrees. Also we are given that angle CBD is 55 degrees.
Since angle CBG is 180 degrees and angle CBF is 35 degrees, angle GBF must be 180 - 90 - 55 = 90 degrees.
Since angle CBG is 180 degrees, angle CBF = 35 degrees, thus angle GBF = CBG - CBF = 90 - 35 = 55 degrees.
However, angle FBG = 35, so m \widehat GF = 35 degrees.
Since angle CBD is 55 degrees, m \widehat CD = 55 degrees.
Also, m \widehat CG = 180 degrees, m \widehat AD = 180 degrees.
We need to find m \widehat AG. Since AD is a diameter, angle ABD = 180 degrees. Angle CBG is a straight angle measuring 180 degrees.
Angle ABG = angle CBG - angle CBA. Also, m \widehat AC = m \widehat CD + m \widehat DG + m \widehat GA.
The angle CBG = angle CBA + angle ABG. So 180 = angle CBA + angle ABG.
angle CBA + angle CBD = 180, thus angle CBA = 180 - 55 = 125 degrees.
Therefore angle ABG = 180 - (180 - 55 - 90 ) = 125 - 90 = 125 degrees.
Since angle CBA = 90 degrees and CBG is a diameter, CBG = 180 degrees. Then the angle ABG = 90 degrees.
Consider angle ABG. Angle CBG = 180 degrees.
m \widehat AG = 90 degrees
angle ABG = 180 - 90 = 90
Angle CBA = 90 degrees, so m arc AC = 90 degrees.
The angle formed by AB and BG = CBG - CBA = 180 - 90 = 90
Since AD is a diameter, angle ABD = 180 degrees. Angle CBG is a diameter and angle CBG = 180 degrees.
angle ABG = angle CBG - angle CBA.
Angle CBA = 90, angle CBF = 35
Since AC is perpendicular to CG, angle ACB = 90,
m \widehat CG = 180
The line containing the center B makes a right angle. Therefore angle CBA = 90. Then m arc AC = 90
angle CBD = 55, so angle DBG = 90 degrees. Since angle FBG is 35 degrees, arc GF is 35 degrees.
arc AC is 90. Then arc AG = arc AC + arc CG = 90 + 180 = 270.
However, this can't be the correct answer.
m∠CBF = 35°, then m arc CF = 35°.
Since CG is a diameter, m arc CG = 180°.
m arc GF = m arc CG - m arc CF = 180° - 35° = 145°.
m∠CBD = 55°, then m arc CD = 55°.
Since AD is a diameter, m arc AD = 180°.
arc AG = 90. angle ABG = 35 degrees, thus arc AG = 35 degrees.
