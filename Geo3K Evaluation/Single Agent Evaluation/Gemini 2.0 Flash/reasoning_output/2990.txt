Let's analyze the figure. We are given that $m \angle 1 = 50^\circ$ and $m \angle 3 = 60^\circ$.
We want to find $m \angle 8$.

Since lines $BT$ and $WD$ are parallel, we know that $\angle 1$ and the angle adjacent to $\angle 4$ on the same side of transversal are supplementary. Let's call the angle adjacent to $\angle 4$ as $\angle x$. Then $m \angle 1 + m \angle x = 180^\circ$. However, this does not immediately lead us to $\angle 8$.

Since lines $BT$ and $WD$ are parallel, and $FJ$ and $AK$ are transversals, we have $\angle 1$ and $\angle 3$ corresponding to the other angles, which can be deduced from them.
The angle between $FJ$ and $BT$ is $50^\circ$. Since $BT$ and $WD$ are parallel, the angle between $AK$ and $BT$ is $60^\circ$. Also, $\angle 1 = 50^\circ$ and $\angle 3 = 60^\circ$.

We can relate $\angle 8$ to $\angle 3$ by noticing that the line containing $\angle 3$ intersects parallel lines $BT$ and $WD$.
Consider the triangle formed by the intersection of the lines $FJ, AK$, and $WD$. Let's call the intersection point of $FJ$ and $AK$ as $Y$. The angles of this triangle are $m \angle 6$, the angle formed by the intersection of $AK$ and $WD$, and the angle formed by the intersection of $FJ$ and $WD$. This triangle has angles $180 - 50 = 130$, $180 - 60 = 120$, and $\angle Y$.
Let's call the point where $FJ$ intersects $WD$ as $S$ and where $AK$ intersects $WD$ as $Q$.
Then, in $\triangle SQY$, we have $m \angle YSQ = 180 - 50 = 130$ and $m \angle YQS = 180 - 60 = 120$.
However, $130 + 120 > 180$, which is not possible.

Instead, let's observe the quadrilateral $EFGR$. The sum of the interior angles in a quadrilateral is 360 degrees. Let the intersection of the transversal lines be $Y$. Then we have that angle $EFG = 180 - \angle 1 = 180 - 50 = 130$, angle $FGR = 180 - \angle 3 = 180 - 60 = 120$, lines $BF$ and $AQ$ are parallel, so we can say that $\angle 8 + \angle 6 = 180$. Now we have $EFGR$.

Let's consider the angles on line OQ:
$m \angle 4 + m \angle 6 + m \angle 5 = 180$ and on line FG:
$m \angle 1 + m \angle EFG = 180$. Since $m \angle 1 = 50$, $m \angle EFG = 130$.
We want to find $m \angle 8$, and lines $BF$ and $AQ$ are parallel.

Let's consider transversal $FC$. It intersects the parallel lines $BF$ and $AQ$. So, $\angle 1 = 50^\circ$, and consider transversal $AG$, it intersects the parallel lines $BF$ and $AQ$, and $\angle 3 = 60^\circ$. Let $\angle KGA = \angle 3 = 60$. Then $QGA = 180-60 = 120$. $\angle A = 60$. Since $\angle 8 + \angle 6 = 180$.
Since the lines $OC$ and $GA$ intersect $BF$ and $AQ$ and $\angle 8$ and $\angle 6$ are supplementary, therefore, $\angle 8$ must be something that depends on $\angle 1$ and $\angle 3$. Since $\angle 8 = x$ (let $x = \angle 8$),
$\angle 8 = 180 - 60 = 120$.
