The given triangle ABC is a right triangle with the right angle at A. We are given that the side AB has length 15, and the angle at C is 60 degrees. We need to find the length of side AC, which is denoted by x.

Since we have a right triangle, we can use trigonometric ratios. We know the length of the side opposite to angle C (AB = 15) and we want to find the length of the side adjacent to angle C (AC = x). Therefore, we can use the tangent function:
tan(C) = opposite / adjacent
tan(60°) = AB / AC
tan(60°) = 15 / x

We know that tan(60°) = sqrt(3), so we have:
sqrt(3) = 15 / x
x = 15 / sqrt(3)

To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and denominator by sqrt(3):
x = (15 * sqrt(3)) / (sqrt(3) * sqrt(3))
x = (15 * sqrt(3)) / 3
x = 5 * sqrt(3)

Now, we compare our result with the given answer choices:
A. 5 * sqrt(2)
B. 5 * sqrt(3)
C. 15 * sqrt(2)
D. 15 * sqrt(3)

Our calculated value of x is 5 * sqrt(3), which matches answer choice B.

Final Answer: B
