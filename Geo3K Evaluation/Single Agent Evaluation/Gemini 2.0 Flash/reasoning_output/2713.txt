The image shows a parallelogram ABCD. We are given m∠ADF = 34°. Since ABCD is a parallelogram, opposite sides are parallel. Thus, AD || BC. Since AD || BC, angles CDF and BCF are alternate interior angles formed by transversal CD. Therefore, m∠BCF = m∠ADF = 34°. We are asked to find m∠CDF. Looking at triangle CDF, we know that m∠DCF = 54° and m∠CFD. In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal so m∠BAD = m∠BCD and m∠ABC = m∠ADC.

Since AD || BC, we have m∠ADF = 34°. m∠CDF is what we want.
Because ABCD is a parallelogram, AD is parallel to BC. Therefore, ∠ADF and ∠BCF are alternate interior angles and must be congruent. So ∠ADF = ∠BCF = 34°. Since ABCD is a parallelogram, AB is parallel to CD. Thus, ∠BAC and ∠DCA are alternate interior angles and are congruent. Also ∠ABD and ∠CDB are alternate interior angles and are congruent.

In triangle AFD, the sum of angles is 180 degrees, thus ∠FAD + ∠ADF + ∠AFD = 180.
49 + 34 + ∠AFD = 180
∠AFD = 180 - 49 - 34
∠AFD = 180 - 83 = 97

∠CFD is supplementary to ∠AFD so ∠CFD + ∠AFD = 180.
∠CFD + 97 = 180
∠CFD = 180 - 97 = 83.
In triangle CDF, ∠DCF + ∠CDF + ∠CFD = 180
54 + ∠CDF + 83 = 180
∠CDF + 137 = 180
∠CDF = 180 - 137 = 43.
