FG is congruent to FH.
Angle FGH = 70 degrees.
Therefore, angle FHG = 70 degrees.
Angle GFH = 180 - 70 - 70 = 40 degrees.
Angle H and angle J have the same measure because BH = BJ. Thus, triangle BHJ is isosceles.
Angle HBJ is x. So angles BHJ and BJH are both equal to (180 - x) / 2.
Also, since FH = HJ, angle FHJ = 1/2 * angle FBJ, where FBJ is the central angle.
However, angle FHJ = (180 - x) / 2. So FHJ = (180 - x) / 2.
Also, angle FHJ = FHG - angle JHG.

We have that angle FHJ = (180 - x) / 2
Thus, the arc FJ creates an inscribed angle FHJ which has measure (180 - x) / 2.
The central angle of the arc FJ is x. The relation between an inscribed angle and its central angle is that the inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle. So angle FHJ = (1/2) * x.
Then we have (1/2) * x = (180 - x) / 2.
Multiply both sides by 2 to get x = 180 - x.
Then 2x = 180. Thus x = 90.
FH = HJ implies that angle FHJ = angle HJF.

However, arc FG has measure equal to its central angle which is x. Thus angle FHJ = 1/2 x.
Angle FHG is 70 degrees.
Angle FHJ = arc (FJ) / 2.
Angle HFJ + FHJ + HJF = 180

FG = FH so angles FHG = FGH = 70. This gives angle GFH = 180 - 70 - 70 = 40.
Arc GJ = 2(70) = 140.
Arcs GH and HJ are the same.
Arc JH is x.
HJB is an isosceles triangle with BH = BJ. So angle BHJ = angle HJB = (180-x)/2 = 90 - x/2
We know the inscribed angle FHJ is 1/2 the central angle FBJ.

Then Arc GH = arc HJ. Let their measures be y.
Then 40 + y + y = 360
We also know that the central angle HJ which has measure y is x. Thus x = y
Then 40 + x + x = 360
40 + 2x = 360
2x = 320
x = 160

Arc GJ = 140
Arc JH + arc HF = 360 - 140 = 220.
Since JH = HF. So each is 110. Then x = 110.

angle GFH = 40 degrees.
Arc HF = 2angle HJF. Also, HJF = 1/2 arc HF.
BH = BJ so the measure of arcs HJ are equal to x, so the angles in triangle BHJ equal 180 degrees. So the other two are equal to (180-x)/2.
x = 40
FHJ is 20.
Angle FHG is 70 so JHJ = 70 - 20 = 50.

The image gives us HJ=HF. So angle HFJ=angle HJF
Angle HBJ =x
angle HFJ= HJ.
Let y be measure. arc of GF =140
We see FG chord = HF Chord
Arc GF=arc FH
Then we 2x +2*35 = 360
2x =180
35
FH arc =2x
2(2*70)= arc

The inscribed angle FGH = 70, so the intercepted arc FH is 2(70) = 140. Since FH = HJ, we have arc HJ = arc FH = 140. The measure of central angle HBJ, x, is therefore equal to arc HJ, so x = 140.
