GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The image shows three parallel lines cut by two transversals. We can use the theorem that states if three or more parallel lines are intersected by two transversals, the intercepted segments on the transversals are proportional. In this case, we have the proportion:

(7x - 2) / (4x + 3) = 8 / 8

Since 8 / 8 = 1, we have:

7x - 2 = 4x + 3

Subtracting 4x from both sides gives:

3x - 2 = 3

Adding 2 to both sides gives:

3x = 5

Dividing both sides by 3 gives:

x = 5/3

Therefore, the value of x is 5/3.
