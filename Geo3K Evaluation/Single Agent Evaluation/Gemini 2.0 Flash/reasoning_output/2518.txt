CHOICES:
A. 0.28
B. 0.29
C. 0.96
D. 3.43

The given figure is a right triangle VWX, where angle W is the right angle.
The side lengths are as follows:
VW = 72
WX = 21
VX = 75
We are asked to find the value of cos X.

In a right triangle, the cosine of an angle is defined as the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse.
In this case, angle X is one of the acute angles in the right triangle VWX. The side adjacent to angle X is WX, and the hypotenuse is VX.

Therefore, cos X = WX / VX = 21 / 75.
To express this as a decimal, we divide 21 by 75.
21 / 75 = 0.28

We need to express the ratio as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.
0.  28 is already to the nearest hundredth.

Comparing our result with the answer choices:
A. 0.28
B. 0.29
C. 0.96
D. 3.43
Our calculated answer matches choice A.

Final Answer: A
