The triangle inequality theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. Applying this theorem to the triangle in the image, we have the following inequalities:

1.  7 + 9 > 2z - 15
2.  7 + (2z - 15) > 9
3.  9 + (2z - 15) > 7

Let's solve each inequality for z:

1.  7 + 9 > 2z - 15
    16 > 2z - 15
    31 > 2z
    z < 15.5

2.  7 + 2z - 15 > 9
    2z - 8 > 9
    2z > 17
    z > 8.5

3.  9 + 2z - 15 > 7
    2z - 6 > 7
    2z > 13
    z > 6.5

Combining these inequalities, we have 8.5 < z < 15.5.

Now, let's test the given answer choices:
A. 7: 7 is not greater than 8.5, so it's not possible.
B. 9: 8.5 < 9 < 15.5, so it's possible.
C. 12: 8.5 < 12 < 15.5, so it's possible.
D. 15: 8.5 < 15 < 15.5, so it's possible.

We don't have enough information to determine the exact value of z.  However, if we assume that the triangle is close to isosceles, then we could try to set the lengths of two sides equal to each other.

Let's try setting 2z-15 = 7:
2z = 22
z = 11

Let's try setting 2z-15 = 9:
2z = 24
z = 12

Let's try setting 7 = 9, which is not possible.

If z = 11, the sides are 7, 9, and 7. This is possible.
If z = 12, the sides are 7, 9, and 9. This is possible.

Let's assume that 2z-15 represents a missing value that makes the triangle close to equilateral. In this case, we want 2z - 15 to be near 7 and 9.
If 2z-15 = 8, 2z=23, then z=11.5. Then choice C, z=12, appears closest.
