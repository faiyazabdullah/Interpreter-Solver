C. 8
D. 16

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let the circle be tangent to AB at E, to BC at D, and to AC at F.
We are given that AF = x, AE = 8, BE = 8, BD = 6. Since tangents from a point to a circle have equal length, we have AE = AF, BE = BD, and CD = CF.
Since AE = 8 and AF = x, we have x = 6. However, we are given AE=8, not 6.

Since BE = 8, we have BD = 8, but we are given BD = 6, so CD = 6. Thus CF = 6.
Since AF = x and CF = 6, we have AC = x + 6.
Since BD = BE = 8, we have BC = BD + CD = 8 + 6 = 14.
In triangle ABC, we have AC = x + 6, BC = 14, and AB = AE + EB = 8 + 8 = 16.
However, there is no direct way to determine x. We are given CF = 6, so AF = 6. Then x=6.

The problem statement says that segments that appear tangent are tangent, but the figure may not be accurate. The question says to find x, where x is the length of AF. The segment BD has length 6 and AE has length 8. Since tangents from a point to a circle have equal length, AF = AE and BD = BE. Therefore, AF = 6.

Final Answer: B
