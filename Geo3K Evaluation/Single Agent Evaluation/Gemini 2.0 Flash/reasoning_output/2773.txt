Given that P is the incenter of \triangle AEC, it is the intersection of the angle bisectors. Thus, EP is the angle bisector of \angle AEC.
We are given that \angle EAC = 33^\circ and \angle ECA = 28.5^\circ.
In \triangle AEC, we have \angle AEC + \angle EAC + \angle ECA = 180^\circ.
Thus, \angle AEC = 180^\circ - 33^\circ - 28.5^\circ = 180^\circ - 61.5^\circ = 118.5^\circ.
Since EP is the angle bisector of \angle AEC, we have \angle AEP = \angle DEP = \frac{1}{2} \angle AEC = \frac{1}{2} (118.5^\circ) = 59.25^\circ.
We want to find the measure of \angle DEP, which is 59.25^\circ.
However, the options are A. 28.5, B. 30, C. 31, D. 33.
The problem statement says that P is the incenter of triangle AEC.
Since P is the incenter, it means that ED is perpendicular to EC. So \angle EDC = 90 degrees.
Also, since P is the incenter, EP bisects \angle AEC. We found that \angle AEC = 118.5 degrees, so \angle AEP = \angle DEP = 59.25^\circ.
Consider \triangle DEC. We have \angle EDC = 90 degrees. Also, \angle DCE = 28.5 degrees. Therefore, \angle DEC = 180 - 90 - 28.5 = 61.5 degrees.
Then \angle DEP = \angle DEC - \angle PEC. Since PC bisects \angle ECA, we have \angle PCA = \angle PCE = 28.5/2 = 14.25 degrees.
Then \angle PEC = 59.25 degrees.
So we want to find the angle DEP. The question says that P is the incenter of triangle AEC. But it looks like P is also the intersection of the altitudes.
Since PD is perpendicular to EC, \angle PDE = 90 degrees. Also \angle PCD = 28.5/2 = 14.25.
So \angle DPE = 180 - 90 - 14.25 = 75.75.
Then \angle DEP = 59.25
Then \angle DEP = 1/2 \angle AEC.
Since P is incenter, EP bisects \angle AEC, and CP bisects \angle ACE.
Then \angle AEP = \angle DEP = \angle AEC/2 = 118.5/2 = 59.25
\angle DCP = \angle PCE = \angle ACE/2 = 28.5/2 = 14.25
Since ED \perp CD, \angle EDC = 90^\circ.
\triangle EDC, \angle DEC = 180 - 90 - 28.5 = 61.5.
We are looking for \angle DEP, so \angle DEP = \angle AEP = 59.25^\circ. However, that is not one of the choices.

Let's consider \triangle PED. \angle EDP = 90^\circ. We need to find \angle PED.
\angle PED = \angle AED - \angle AEP.
