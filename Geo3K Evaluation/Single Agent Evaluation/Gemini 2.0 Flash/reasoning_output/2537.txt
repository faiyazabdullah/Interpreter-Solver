GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

From the image, we have \angle AFC = (4a - 1)^\circ, \angle AFD = (2a - 5)^\circ, and \angle AFB = 72^\circ.
Since AC is a diameter, \angle AFC is a straight angle, so \angle AFC = 180^\circ.
We also have \angle AFD + \angle DFC = \angle AFC.
Since \angle AFD and \angle AFB are adjacent, \angle AFB + \angle BFC = 180 - \angle AFB.
Also, \angle AFB + \angle AFD + \angle DFC = 180^\circ.
Since AF and FC form a straight line, angles \angle AFB and \angle BFC are supplementary, meaning \angle AFB + \angle BFC = 180^\circ.
Angles \angle AFD and \angle DFC also form the straight line AC, so \angle AFD + \angle DFC = 180^\circ.
We are given that \angle AFB = 72^\circ.
We also have \angle AFC = \angle AFB + \angle BFC = 180^\circ.
Since \angle AFB = 72^\circ, we have \angle BFC = 180^\circ - 72^\circ = 108^\circ.
We are given that \angle AFC = (4a - 1)^\circ, so 4a - 1 = 180.
Then 4a = 181, so a = 181/4 = 45.25.
We are given that \angle AFD = (2a - 5)^\circ, so \angle AFD = 2(45.25) - 5 = 90.5 - 5 = 85.5^\circ.
Then \angle DFC = 180^\circ - \angle AFD = 180^\circ - 85.5^\circ = 94.5^\circ.
The question asks for the measure of \angle AFB, which is given as 72^\circ.
