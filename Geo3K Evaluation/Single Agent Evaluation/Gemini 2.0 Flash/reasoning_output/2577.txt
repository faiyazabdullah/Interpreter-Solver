Triangles ΔPST and ΔQVW are similar because they have two congruent angles.
PS = PR and QV = QW, therefore angles ∠R = ∠P and ∠V = ∠Q. Also, ∠S = ∠V by observation
Since triangles are similar, the sides are proportional.

PS/QV = ST/VW
Given QV = 3 and ST = 13.5. We also know that QW = 3, so VW = 3 + 9 = 12
PS/3 = 13.5/12
PS = (3 * 13.5) / 12 = 40.5 / 12 = 3.375

Given that PR = PS = x
So, let's look at the ratio again between the two triangles.
RQ/ST = VQ/UW.

We have PS/QV = RS/VW
From the image, we also see that RQ/PS = VW/UQ = RW/QU = x
Given that PS = x, RS = x, and ST = 13.5, let's look at the side proportions.

Since triangles are similar:
PS/QV = ST/UW = PR/VW
where PS=x, QV = 3, ST=13.5, QW=3, QW=9, so VW= 3+9 = 12, PR = x

x/3 = 13.5/12
x = (13.5*3)/12 = 40.5/12 = 3.375

From this diagram, PQST and QVW are similar triangles.
Hence, PS/QV = PR/QW = ST/UW.

From the figure, we see that PS = PR = x, and QV = QW = 3, UW = 9

PS/3 = PR/9
But since PS = PR = x,
x/3 = 13.5 / (UW)
x/3 = x/(3+9) = x/12
UW = 9

Since triangles are similar:
x/3 = (x + x)/ (3 + 9)
x/3 = 2x/12 = x/6
12x = 6x + something.
This is wrong.

However, we see that R, P, S and Q, V, W are corresponding sides.
SP/VQ = ST/VW
x/3 = 13.5 / (3+9) = 13.5/12
12x = 3 * 13.5 = 40.5
x = 40.5/12 = 3.375.

However, looking at PR/QV, that could be 4.5.
Let's compare the given answer choices.
If x = 3, 3/3 = 1. 13.5 / 1. 13.
If x = 4.5, 4.5/3 = 1.5, so 13.5/(1.5) = 9
The closest answer here is B.
