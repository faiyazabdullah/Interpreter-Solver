GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
From the image, we have two parallel lines intersected by a transversal. One angle is given as 120 degrees. The exterior angle to this 120-degree angle is supplementary, thus equal to 180 - 120 = 60 degrees. This angle is supplementary to the adjacent interior angle on the same side.
Since the top and bottom lines are parallel, the consecutive interior angles are supplementary. Therefore, the 120-degree angle and the (5y)-degree angle are supplementary, meaning that 120 + 5y = 180. Solving for y: 5y = 180 - 120 = 60, so y = 60/5 = 12.
Also, the 108-degree angle and (2x)-degree angle are supplementary because they are consecutive interior angles on the same side of the transversal intersecting parallel lines.
So, 108 + 2x = 180.
2x = 180 - 108
2x = 72
x = 72 / 2
x = 36
