QUESTION:
Find the area of the regular polygon figure. Round to the nearest tenth.

CHOICES:
A. 10.8
B. 21.7
C. 65.0
D. 129.9

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

The figure is a regular hexagon. The distance from the center H to a vertex (like G) is 5 m. This distance is the radius of the circumscribed circle.
A regular hexagon is made up of 6 equilateral triangles. The side length of each equilateral triangle is equal to the radius of the circumscribed circle. Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is 5 m.

The area of a regular hexagon with side length s is given by the formula:
Area = (3√3 / 2) * s²

In this case, s = 5 m.
Area = (3√3 / 2) * 5²
Area = (3√3 / 2) * 25
Area = (75√3) / 2
Area ≈ (75 * 1.732) / 2
Area ≈ 129.9 / 2
Area ≈ 64.95 m²

Rounding to the nearest tenth, the area is approximately 65.0 m².
