GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The diameters of circles A, B, and C are 10, 30, and 10 respectively, so their radii are 5, 15, and 5 respectively.
It is given that $AZ \cong CW$ and $CW = 2$. Since $AZ = CW$, $AZ = 2$.
The points A, Z, X, B, Y, W, C, and D lie on a line.
Point A is the center of circle A, so $AZ$ is a segment on the radius of circle A.
Therefore $AZ = 2$.
Point A is the center of circle A, and X is a point on the circumference of circle B.
Therefore, $AX = AB - BX$.
Since AB is the sum of the radii of circle A and circle B, $AB = 5 + 15 = 20$.
Thus, $AX = AB - BX = 20$.
We are given that $AZ = 2$.
$ZX = AX - AZ$.
$ZX = 20 - 2 = 18$.

We are looking for ZX given that AZ is congruent to CW and CW = 2.
AZ = 2.
The radius of circle A is 10/2 = 5.
The radius of circle B is 30/2 = 15.
The radius of circle C is 10/2 = 5.
AB = 5 + 15 = 20
BC = 15 + 5 = 20
We want to find ZX. Since AZ = 2 and radius A is 5, then Z is inside circle A. Since CW = 2 and radius C is 5, W is inside circle C.
X is the intersection of circle A and circle B. So AX is the distance from the center A to the circle B. AB = 20.
AZ = 2, we need to find ZX.
If X is outside of circle A then we have AX = AZ + ZX. 20 = 2 + ZX
ZX = 18
However, the question asks for ZX if AZ and CW are congruent and CW = 2.
AX is the distance from A to X. X is on the circle B, where B is the center.
AX = AB + radius B.
If we have AX = AB then ZX = AB - AZ
AZ = 2
AX = 5+15 - 5 - 2 = 20
AX = AB = 20.
Then AZ + ZX = AX. So ZX = AX - AZ
Since AX = AB = radius of A + radius of B = 5 + 15 = 20
ZX = 20 - 2 = 18

I misunderstood the diagram.
We have AZ = 2
$ZX = r_A + r_B -AZ= 5+15 -2 = 20-5-2 = 18$
Since A Z is congruent to C W and C W = 2, we have A Z = 2
Let's assume A Z = C W = 2.
A X = A B - (2+18)
Looking at the figure again, we have $AZ=2$ and $ZX=?$. $AX = AB - r_B$, so we would want $AX = AB - BX$. This is where BX = 10

Since AZ=2, radius A=5, radius B=15, radius C=5. Then AB=20, BC=20.
AZ + ZX = AX
2 + ZX = AB
Then ZX = BX where BX is between X to the circle B center and outside it and ZX < r_B - r_A

So we have that AX = radius Circle A + radius Circle B
