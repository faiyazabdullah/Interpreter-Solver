The image shows a right triangle ABC, where angle A is 90 degrees, angle B is 30 degrees, and the length of the hypotenuse BC is 22. We need to find the length of side AC, which is labeled as h.

Since we have a right triangle, we can use trigonometric ratios. We are given the angle B (30 degrees) and the hypotenuse BC (22). We want to find the length of the opposite side AC (h).

The sine function relates the opposite side and the hypotenuse:
sin(angle) = opposite / hypotenuse
sin(30) = h / 22

We know that sin(30) = 1/2. Therefore:
1/2 = h / 22

To solve for h, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 22:
h = (1/2) * 22
h = 11

So, the length of side AC (h) is 11.

Comparing our result with the answer choices, we see that h = 11 matches answer choice A.

Final Answer: A
