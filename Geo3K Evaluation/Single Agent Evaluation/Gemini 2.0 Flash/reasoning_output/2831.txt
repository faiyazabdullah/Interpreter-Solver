Let $AB = 15$, $AD = x$, $DF = 8$, and $CF = 12$. Since $DF$ is tangent to the circle at $F$, we can use the tangent-secant theorem, which states that $DF^2 = AD \cdot DB$. Also, since $CF$ is tangent to the circle at $F$, we can use the tangent-secant theorem, which states that $CF^2 = CA \cdot CB$. We have $DB = AB + AD = 15+x$. Thus, $DF^2 = AD \cdot DB$, so $8^2 = x(15+x)$, which gives $64 = 15x+x^2$, so $x^2+15x-64 = 0$.
Using the quadratic formula, $x = \frac{-15 \pm \sqrt{15^2 - 4(1)(-64)}}{2} = \frac{-15 \pm \sqrt{225 + 256}}{2} = \frac{-15 \pm \sqrt{481}}{2}$.
Since $x$ must be positive, $x = \frac{-15 + \sqrt{481}}{2} \approx \frac{-15 + 21.93}{2} \approx \frac{6.93}{2} \approx 3.465$.
Since the figure in the image does not accurately portray this result, let's examine other possible relationships.
Consider the case where $AD$ is an external segment and $AB$ is a secant. Also $CF$ is tangent.
$DF^2 = AD(AD+AB)$, so $8^2 = x(x+15)$, thus $64 = x^2+15x$, so $x^2+15x-64 = 0$.
Then $x = \frac{-15 \pm \sqrt{15^2 - 4(1)(-64)}}{2} = \frac{-15 \pm \sqrt{225+256}}{2} = \frac{-15 \pm \sqrt{481}}{2}$.
Since $x$ must be positive, we have $x = \frac{-15+\sqrt{481}}{2} \approx \frac{-15+21.9317}{2} \approx \frac{6.9317}{2} \approx 3.465$.
However, this value is not in the given answer choices.
Assume that the circle intersects $AD$ at $A$, and let $AD$ extend beyond the circle. Let $BD$ be the secant and $CF$ be tangent to the circle.
Consider the power of point $D$: $DF^2 = DA \cdot DB = DA (DA+AB)$. Then $8^2 = x(x+15)$, so $64 = x^2 + 15x$, which is $x^2+15x-64=0$. We have $x = \frac{-15 \pm \sqrt{15^2-4(-64)}}{2} = \frac{-15 \pm \sqrt{225+256}}{2} = \frac{-15 \pm \sqrt{481}}{2}$.
$x = \frac{-15+\sqrt{481}}{2} \approx \frac{-15+21.93}{2} \approx 3.465$. This still doesn't match any of the answer choices.
If $AD = 7.2$, then $AD \cdot DB = 7.2(7.2+15) = 7.2(22.2) = 159.84$, which is approximately $12.64^2$.
Let's assume that the length 12 is a typo, and it should have been around 8.

However, let's carefully review what we have. We have $DF=8$, $AB=15$. We are looking for $x=AD$. We have $DF^2 = AD(AD+AB) \implies 8^2 = x(x+15) \implies 64 = x^2 + 15x \implies x^2 + 15x - 64 = 0$. The solutions are $x = \frac{-15 \pm \sqrt{15^2 - 4(1)(-64)}}{2} = \frac{-15 \pm \sqrt{225+256}}{2} = \frac{-15 \pm \sqrt{481}}{2}$. So $x = \frac{-15 + \sqrt{481}}{2} \approx \frac{-15 + 21.93}{2} \approx 3.47$. The closest answer to this value is none of the choices.
