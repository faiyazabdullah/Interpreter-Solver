B. 33
C. 67
D. 134

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

Given that radius OB is perpendicular to chord CD, then OB bisects chord CD at point X.
Since CD = 24 inches, then CX = XD = 12 inches.
Also, the radius of circle O is 13 inches, so OC = 13 inches.
We can consider right triangle OCX, where OC is the hypotenuse.
By the Pythagorean theorem, $OC^2 = CX^2 + OX^2$, so $13^2 = 12^2 + OX^2$.
Then $169 = 144 + OX^2$, so $OX^2 = 25$, and $OX = 5$.
Since OB is a radius, OB = 13 inches.
Then BX = OB - OX = 13 - 5 = 8 inches.
The measure of arc CD is 134 degrees.
Since OB is perpendicular to CD, then OB bisects arc CD.
Therefore, the measure of arc CB is half of the measure of arc CD.
Thus, m arc CB = (1/2) * m arc CD = (1/2) * 134 = 67 degrees.
