Let the given figure be quadrilateral RSTV.
Given RS = 6 and VT = 3. Also, RX = XV.
The image shows RX = SY.
Given RX is twice the length of XV is incorrect in the question, since RX = XV in the figure. We will assume that RX = XV. Since RX = XV, X is the midpoint of RV.
Also SY = YT. So Y is the midpoint of ST.
If XY is parallel to RS and VT, then XY = (RS + VT)/2 = (6 + 3)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5
However, we are given that RX = SY. Also RV = ST since RX = XV and SY = YT.
Let RV = ST. Since the quadrilateral is an isosceles trapezoid, the bases are parallel. Therefore, RS || VT and XY || RS || VT.
Since RX = XV and SY = YT, X and Y are midpoints of RV and ST respectively.
XY is the midsegment.
XY = (RS + VT)/2 = (6 + 3)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5

Since the problem statement says RX is twice the length of XV, we have RX = 2XV. Let XV = a. Then RX = 2a. Then RV = RX + XV = 2a + a = 3a.
Also SY = YT. Then SY = YT = b.
Let's assume that R S T V is an isosceles trapezoid with RX=2XV, then RX is not equal to XV in the diagram. And also we are given RS =6, VT=3. Since RX = 2XV and SY = YT, we can assume that RV = RX + XV = 2XV + XV = 3XV and ST = SY + YT = 2YT.
Let RX = 2XV, so XV = RX/2. Then RV = RX + RX/2 = (3/2)RX.
Since RV = ST, we have ST = (3/2)RX. Also SY = YT.
Since RX = SY, then ST = (3/2)SY.
ST = SY + YT = 2SY. Thus 2SY = (3/2)SY which is not true.
Thus we will assume RX=XV, then X and Y are mid points of RV and ST. Since RS||XY||VT. We have XY = (RS+VT)/2 = (6+3)/2=4.5. But this value is not in the options.
