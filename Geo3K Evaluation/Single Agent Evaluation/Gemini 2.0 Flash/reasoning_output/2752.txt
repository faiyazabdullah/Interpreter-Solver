Let's analyze the figure. We are given that $m \angle 1 = 50^{\circ}$ and $m \angle 3 = 60^{\circ}$. We want to find the measure of $\angle 6$.
Since lines WB and AD are parallel, we know that $\angle 1$ and $\angle 4$ are alternate interior angles formed by the transversal line passing through points B, F, O, and R. Thus, $m \angle 4 = m \angle 1 = 50^{\circ}$.
Similarly, since lines WB and AD are parallel, $\angle 3$ and $\angle 5$ are alternate interior angles formed by the transversal line passing through points A, G, O, and N. So, $m \angle 5 = m \angle 3 = 60^{\circ}$.
We also know that angles $\angle 4$, $\angle 6$, and $\angle 5$ form a straight angle, which means their measures add up to $180^{\circ}$. Therefore, we have:
$m \angle 4 + m \angle 6 + m \angle 5 = 180^{\circ}$
$50^{\circ} + m \angle 6 + 60^{\circ} = 180^{\circ}$
$110^{\circ} + m \angle 6 = 180^{\circ}$
$m \angle 6 = 180^{\circ} - 110^{\circ}$
$m \angle 6 = 70^{\circ}$
Therefore, the measure of $\angle 6$ is $70^{\circ}$.
