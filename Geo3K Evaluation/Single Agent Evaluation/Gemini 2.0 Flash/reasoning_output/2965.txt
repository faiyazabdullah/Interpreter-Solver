GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The figure shows a triangle WXY. The sides are marked with values 9x, 4x+5, and 6x+3. The marks on each side indicate that the sides are equal. Therefore, the triangle is equilateral. An equilateral triangle has all sides equal in length.

So, we can write the equations:
9x = 4x + 5
9x = 6x + 3
4x + 5 = 6x + 3

Let's solve the first equation:
9x = 4x + 5
9x - 4x = 5
5x = 5
x = 1

Let's solve the second equation:
9x = 6x + 3
9x - 6x = 3
3x = 3
x = 1

Let's solve the third equation:
4x + 5 = 6x + 3
5 - 3 = 6x - 4x
2 = 2x
x = 1

Therefore, x = 1.
