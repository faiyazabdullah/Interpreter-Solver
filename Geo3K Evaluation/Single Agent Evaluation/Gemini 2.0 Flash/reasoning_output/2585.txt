We are given a right triangle PQR with a right angle at R. We are given the lengths of the sides: PR = 8, QR = 15, and PQ = 17. We are asked to find the value of sin P as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.

In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, we want to find sin P.
The side opposite to angle P is QR, which has a length of 15.
The hypotenuse is PQ, which has a length of 17.
So, sin P = QR / PQ = 15 / 17.

Now, we need to express this fraction as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.
15 / 17 â‰ˆ 0.88235...
Rounding to the nearest hundredth, we get 0.88.

The answer choices are:
A. 0.47
B. 0.53
C. 0.88
D. 1.88

Our calculated value of sin P is approximately 0.88, which matches answer choice C.
