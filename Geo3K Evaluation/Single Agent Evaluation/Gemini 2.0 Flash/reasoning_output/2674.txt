Given that $m \angle DFA = 50^\circ$ and $CF \perp FB$, we want to find $m \widehat{ACE}$.
First, we find $m \angle CFB$. Since $CF \perp FB$, we have $m \angle CFB = 90^\circ$.
Since $m \angle DFA = 50^\circ$, the measure of arc $DA$ is $50^\circ$. Also, since $AB$ is a straight line, $m \angle AFB = 180^\circ$.
The measure of $\angle AFC = 180^\circ - 50^\circ = 130^\circ$. Therefore, $m \widehat{AC} = 130^\circ$.
Since $m \angle CFB = 90^\circ$, the measure of arc $CB$ is $90^\circ$.
The measure of arc $BE$ is also $90^\circ$, as $\angle BFE=90^\circ$ and $CF \perp FB$.
$m \widehat{ACE} = m \widehat{AC} + m \widehat{CE}$
To find $m \widehat{CE}$, we know that $m \widehat{AE} = 180^\circ$, because $\angle AFE$ forms a straight angle. Since $m \angle AFB = 180^\circ$ and $m \angle AFE = 180^\circ$, we can calculate that $m \angle AFE = m \angle BFC$.
$m \widehat{AC} = 130^\circ$ and $m \widehat{CE} = m \widehat{CB} + m \widehat{BE}$, but we cannot simply add. Instead, $m \angle AFE = 180$, which means $m \angle AFE = 180$. Since $m \angle AFB = 180$, the arc $AEB = 180$, so $m \angle BFE$ corresponds to the arc $BE$, which forms $90^\circ$.
The angle $\angle AFB = 180^\circ$, so the arc $AB$ is $180^\circ$.
We know that $m \widehat{DA} = 50^\circ$, which means $m \angle DFA = 50^\circ$. We have $m \widehat{AC} = 180 - 50 - 90 = \angle AFC = 130$. Since arc $BE = 90^\circ$ since $\angle BFE=90^\circ$ due to $CF \perp FB$.
Therefore $m \widehat{ACE} = 360^\circ - m \widehat{AEB} - m \widehat{CB} = 360 - m \widehat{DA} - 50 = 310$. Since arc $AC = 130^\circ$, then we are looking for $ACE = AC+CE$, we know that arc $AC = 130^\circ$. The entire circle's measure is $360^\circ$, so $m \widehat{ACE}=180+50 = 230^\circ$
We are trying to find $m \widehat{ACE} = m \widehat{AC} + m \widehat{CE}$. We know that $m \widehat{AC} = 130^\circ$. We need to find $m \widehat{CE} = 180^\circ + 50 + 90 = 320^\circ$. $m \widehat{AC} + m \widehat{CE} = 270$. The arc is ACB = A+C+B, then ACB =
We want to find $m\widehat{ACE}= m\widehat{AC}+m\widehat{CE}$. We have $m\widehat{AC}=130^\circ$. Also $m\widehat{AFB}=180^\circ$ and $m\widehat{CFB}=90^\circ$ so we have $m\widehat{BFE} = 90^\circ$. Thus $AE= 180-50=130^\circ$ and $AE=AC+CE$, which implies that $m\widehat{AC}=180$. Thus, $m\widehat{AE} = 130$. Then $EC = AE-AC$. Thus we have E =180
Then$AE =360$. $m\widehat{ACE}=m\widehat{AC}+m\widehat{CE}=130 + BE + BC$.
