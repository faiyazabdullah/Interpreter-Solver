The given figure is a right triangle ABC, where angle B is the right angle. The length of side BC is 24, the length of side AC is 74, and the length of side AB is x. We need to find the value of x using the Pythagorean theorem.
The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, AC is the hypotenuse, so we have:
AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2
74^2 = x^2 + 24^2
5476 = x^2 + 576
x^2 = 5476 - 576
x^2 = 4900
x = sqrt(4900)
x = 70
The value of x is 70.
The answer choices are:
A. 66
B. 68
C. 70
D. 72
The closest answer to our calculated result is 70, which is choice C.
