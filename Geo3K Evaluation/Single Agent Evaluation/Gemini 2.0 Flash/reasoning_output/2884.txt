From the figure, we can see that BF || CE and FD || AB. This implies that BCDF is a parallelogram. Therefore, BC = FD and BF = CD.
We are given that AB = 6, AF = 8, BC = x, CD = y, DE = 2y - 3, and FE = x + 10/3.
Since BCDF is a parallelogram, we have BC = FD = x and BF = CD = y.
Also, we are given DE = 2y - 3 and FE = x + 10/3.
Now, using similar triangles, we can write the following ratios:
Triangle AFE is similar to triangle ABC.
Therefore, AF/AB = FE/BC = AE/AC.
Substituting the given values, we get:
8/6 = (x + 10/3) / x
4/3 = (x + 10/3) / x
4x = 3x + 10
x = 10

Now, let's check triangle FDE.
Since FD || AB, triangle FDE is similar to triangle ABC is not applicable here.
Since FD || AB, we have CD = y and DE = 2y - 3. Thus, CE = CD + DE = y + 2y - 3 = 3y - 3.
From the similarity of triangles AFE and ACE, and ABC, we have
AF/AC = FE/CE = AE/AB
In our case, we have
AF/AB = FE/BC
8/6 = (x + 10/3)/x which we already used to find x=10
Triangle AFE is similar to triangle ABC. So
AF/AB = FE/BC
Substituting the values,
8/6 = (x + 10/3) / x
4/3 = (x + 10/3) / x
4x = 3x + 10
x = 10

We also have that BFDE is not necessarily a parallelogram.
We have BF || CD and FD || BE. But we are also given AB = 6, AF = 8, BC = x = 10, CD = y, DE = 2y - 3, FE = x + 10/3 = 10 + 10/3 = 40/3.
Because BF || CD and FD || AB, quadrilateral BCDF is a parallelogram.
So BF = CD and BC = FD. So CD = y and FD = x = 10. Since FD = 10, FD || AB, so CE = 3y - 3
Now AF/AB = FE/BC = (x + 10/3) / x = (10 + 10/3) / 10 = (40/3) / 10 = 4/3
Thus we have AF/AB = 8/6 = 4/3
Let AB = 6, BC = x, AC = AC.
The correct answer is 10.
