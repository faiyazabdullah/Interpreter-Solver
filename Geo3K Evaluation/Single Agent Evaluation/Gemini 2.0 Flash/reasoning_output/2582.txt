Triangle MLN is a triangle. LP is an altitude of the triangle MLN, and also NP is an altitude of the triangle MLN. MP is common to both the triangles.
Since MP bisects angle M, the MP is also an angle bisector. Therefore, the triangle MLN is an isosceles triangle.
ML = MN
3x+6 = 4x-2
x = 8
ML = 3(8) + 6 = 24 + 6 = 30
MN = 4(8) - 2 = 32 - 2 = 30
Therefore ML = MN = 30.
Triangle MPL is a right triangle, also triangle MPN is a right triangle.
Since ML = MN and angle LMP = angle NMP = 25, triangle MPL is congruent to triangle MPN.
Therefore, LP = NP.
Consider right triangle MPN.
MN = 30
NP = 4x - 2
Thus, the problem asks us to find NP, which we know to be 4x - 2 = 4(8) - 2 = 30.
