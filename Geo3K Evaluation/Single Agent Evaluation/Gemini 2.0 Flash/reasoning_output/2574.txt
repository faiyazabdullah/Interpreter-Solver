GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
GJ is a diameter of circle K.
Angle HKJ = 122 degrees.
The question asks for the measure of arc GLJ.
The arc GJ is a semi-circle and has a measure of 180 degrees.
To find the measure of arc GLJ, we need to find the measure of arc GL.
The measure of angle HKJ is 122 degrees, so the measure of arc HJ is 122 degrees.
The measure of arc HGJ is 180 degrees, since GJ is a diameter.
Therefore, the measure of arc HG is 180 - 122 = 58 degrees.
The entire circle is 360 degrees.
We are looking for the measure of arc GLJ, which is the arc from G to J passing through L. Since GJ is a diameter, the measure of arc GJ is 180 degrees. Therefore, arc GLJ is composed of arcs GL and LJ.
We need to determine the measure of arc GL.
Since the problem doesn't give us anything about the position of L, let us assume that the question is trying to determine the semicircle arc, GLJ.
Therefore, the measure of arc GLJ is 180 degrees.
