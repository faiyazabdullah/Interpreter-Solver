Let's analyze the triangle WXZ. We are given that $\angle W = 23^\circ$ and $\angle Z = 24^\circ$. We can find $\angle WXZ$ using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, in triangle WXZ, we have:
$\angle W + \angle Z + \angle WXZ = 180^\circ$
$23^\circ + 24^\circ + \angle WXZ = 180^\circ$
$47^\circ + \angle WXZ = 180^\circ$
$\angle WXZ = 180^\circ - 47^\circ = 133^\circ$

Now, we are given that $\angle 3$ is adjacent to $\angle WXZ$, and that $\angle WXZ + \angle 3 = 105 + \angle 3 = 180$, so $\angle 3$ and $\angle WXZ$ are supplementary.
The angle $\angle WXZ$ is equal to $133^\circ$. The angle $\angle WXY = 105^\circ$. Thus the angle between the lines $XW$ and $XZ$ is equal to 133 degrees.
We are given that $\angle 3 + 105^\circ = 180$, so
$\angle 3 = 133$, which can also be written as $\angle ZXY = 105^\circ$.
Now let's look at the triangle XYZ. We know that $\angle Z = 24^\circ$ and $\angle ZXY = 105^\circ$. We want to find $\angle 1$ which is $\angle Y$.
We know that $\angle Y + \angle Z + \angle ZXY = 180^\circ$
$\angle 1 + 24^\circ + 105^\circ = 180^\circ$
$\angle 1 + 129^\circ = 180^\circ$
$\angle 1 = 180^\circ - 129^\circ$
$\angle 1 = 51^\circ$
Since 51 is not one of the choices, there's an error in our approach.
In triangle XYZ, $\angle Z = 24$, and $\angle X = 105$ in the diagram.  The sum of angles in a triangle = 180, so $24 + 105 + \angle Y = 180$, so $\angle Y = 180 - 129 = 51$.
Let's reconsider the information. We are given $\angle Z = 24^\circ$, $\angle YXZ = 105^\circ$.  We are looking for $\angle 1$, which is the angle at vertex Y. We know that the sum of the angles in triangle XYZ is 180. Therefore, $\angle 1 + 24^\circ + 105^\circ = 180^\circ$, so $\angle 1 = 180 - 129 = 51^\circ$.

However, we have to consider that the given angle next to Z, namely 24 degrees, is just one part of the whole angle $\angle WZX$. The whole $\angle WZX = \angle 2 + 24$. So, we need to use the value of 24 to find $\angle Y$, labeled as angle 1.
Since $23 + 24 + \angle XWZ = 180$, $\angle XWZ = 180 - 47 = 133$.  We also know that $\angle YXZ = 105$. The whole angle at Z needs to be calculated using $180 = \angle 1 + 105 + \angle Z$.

$\angle Z = 180 - 23 - 105 = 52$. The triangle at the base is $133 + 24 + 23$, and the sum of angles in $WXZ$ must be 180, that is, $180 = 23+24+105+(51)$.  Since $\angle 1 + \angle Z + \angle ZXY = 180$, $\angle 1 + 24 + 105 = 180$, and $\angle 1 = 180 - 129 = 51$.
But this doesn't explain why 51 isn't an option. Let's assume that 24 refers to $\angle 2$, not $Z$.

Then, in triangle XYZ, $\angle YXZ = 105$, $\angle YZX = 24 = \angle 2$, and we need to find $\angle 1$. The sum is 180, so $\angle 1 = 180 - (105 + 24) = 180 - 129 = 51$. If we instead mean the sum of all the angle $WZX$, then the number 24 refers only to the $\angle Z$.
Considering that the given 24 only refers to a partial angle at Z. Then triangle $YXZ$ must follow the rule. $24+\angle 1+105=180$. $\angle 1 =51$.
