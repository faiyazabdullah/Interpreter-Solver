Let V be the point outside the circle, B be the point on the circle such that VB is tangent to the circle, T be the center of the circle, and U be the point on the circle such that VU is a secant line.
The tangent-secant theorem states that if a tangent segment and a secant segment are drawn to a circle from an external point, then the square of the length of the tangent segment is equal to the product of the length of the secant segment and the length of its external secant segment.
In this case, the tangent segment is VB, and the secant segment is VU. The length of VB is 11 and the length of VU is 7+x. The length of the external secant segment is VU, which is 7. Thus, we have the equation:
$VB^2 = VU \cdot VV$
$11^2 = (VU)(7)$ where VU = 7+x
$VB^2 = VU \cdot VB'$
$11^2 = (7+x)(7)$
$121 = 49+7x$
$121 - 49 = 7x$
$72 = 7x$
$x = \frac{72}{7} \approx 10.2857$

I made an error in setting up the equation.
According to the secant-tangent theorem, $VB^2 = VU \cdot VV'$ where $VB$ is the tangent and $VU$ is the secant, and $VV'$ is the external segment of the secant. Here $VB = 11$, $VU = 7+x$ and the external part is $VU=7$.
Therefore, $11^2 = 7(7+x)$, so $121 = 49 + 7x$, then $7x = 121 - 49 = 72$, and $x = \frac{72}{7} \approx 10.2857$.
None of the options are close to 10.2857. The question asks to find x.
It is given that VB is tangent to the circle. So, $VB^2 = VU (VU - x)$. Then $11^2 = (7+x)7$,
$121 = 49+7x$, $7x = 121-49=72$, $x = \frac{72}{7} \approx 10.3$.
If UV is the external part then $VU = 7$, $UV+x$ is the secant length.

However, VB is 11, so this must be:
VB^2 = (VU)(VU + X).
Thus $11^2 = 7(7+X)$,  $121=49+7X$, thus $X=72/7 = 10.28$.

None of the answer choices is close to 10.3. Perhaps the length VU = 7, then it should be 7xVU. So it says find x
Using power of a point 7+x
11^2 = 7(7+x), 121 = 49 + 7x, 72=7x, x = 10.3. So maybe the correct answer is not shown

Let us assume that the image might not be to scale.
