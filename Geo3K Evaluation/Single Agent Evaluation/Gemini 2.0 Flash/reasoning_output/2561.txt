GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

The figure can be seen as a rectangle with a triangle cut out. The rectangle has sides of length 6 m and 5 m. So the area of the rectangle is 6 * 5 = 30 square meters. The triangle has two sides of length 4 m, and it is a right triangle because the original figure has right angles at B and E, and thus at A and D as well. The area of the two triangles with sides of 4m are the same. We can form a square with sides of 4 m and then bisect it to create the two triangles. The legs of the triangle are of length 4. So, the area of one triangle is (1/2) * 4 * 4 = 8 square meters. Therefore the area of two triangles is 8. The figure is the rectangle minus one of the triangles at each corner so its area is 30 - 8 = 22.

The figure can also be looked at as two identical triangles and a rectangle. The area of the rectangle is 5 x 6 = 30. The area of each triangle is (1/2) x 4 x 4 = 8. The area of the two triangles combined is 8.
To determine area we subtract the two triangles (combined) from the rectangle, therefore 30 - 8 = 22.
