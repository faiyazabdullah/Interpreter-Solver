CHOICES:
A. 6.5
B. 15.6
C. 22.1
D. 37.7

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The shaded region is a sector of a circle minus a triangle.
The radius of the circle is 6 mm.
The central angle of the sector is 360 degrees - 240 degrees = 120 degrees.
The area of the sector is (120/360) * pi * r^2 = (1/3) * pi * 6^2 = (1/3) * pi * 36 = 12 * pi
The area of the sector is approximately 12 * 3.14159 = 37.699
The triangle has two sides of length 6 and an included angle of 120 degrees.
The area of the triangle is (1/2) * 6 * 6 * sin(120) = (1/2) * 36 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 9 * sqrt(3)
The area of the triangle is approximately 9 * 1.732 = 15.588
The area of the shaded region is the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle.
Area of shaded region = 37.699 - 15.588 = 22.111
