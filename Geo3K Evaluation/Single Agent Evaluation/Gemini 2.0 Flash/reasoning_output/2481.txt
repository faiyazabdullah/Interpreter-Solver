Given that circle P is congruent to circle Q, this means that their circumferences are equal.
In circle P, the measure of arc RS is given as 155 degrees. Since RS is a diameter, the remaining arc has a measure of 180 degrees. Thus, 155 + arc measure = 360.
So the central angle that intercepts arc RS is also 155 degrees. Since RS is a diameter, 3x is the diameter of the circle, but that is irrelevant.
In circle Q, the measure of one arc is given as 205 degrees. The measure of arc TU is given as 7x - 44 degrees. The chord TU cuts the circle into two arcs, such that the sum of those arcs is 360 degrees.
Therefore, 205 + 7x - 44 = 360
7x + 161 = 360
7x = 360 - 161
7x = 199

However, RS is a diameter of circle P, and its length is 3x. This information might be relevant if we knew the length of the diameter or radius of circle Q.
Given that the circles are congruent, the radii are equal. Therefore the diameters are equal as well. 
3x = diameter of circle P.
TU is a chord in circle Q. 
The arcs can be set to equal each other.
155 = 7x - 44
7x = 155 + 44
7x = 199
x = 199/7 = 28.42857...
This doesn't match any answers.
The arcs cannot be set equal. The entire circles need to be considered. 
155 + 3x = 360
205 + 7x - 44 = 360
From the first equation, 3x = 205
x = 205/3
From the second equation, 7x = 360 - 205 + 44 = 199
x = 199/7 = 28.42857

Let us try setting only the large arcs equal to each other. 
The large arc in P is 360 - 155 = 205.
The large arc in Q is 205. This does not give us any information about the relationship between x and known values. 

Assume the arcs are equal. 
7x - 44 = 155
7x = 199
x = 199/7
Approximately, x = 28.

If the other arcs are equal:
205 = 155
7x - 44 = 3(28.42857)
7x - 44 = 85.28571
7x = 129.2857
x = 18.469
Not the correct answer.
The equation 205 + 7x - 44 = 360 is correct.
The equation 155 + 3x = 360 is also correct.
But the diameters may not be equal. We know the radii are equal, however. 
Let's assume the other arcs are equal. 
360 - 155 = 205
360 - (7x-44) = 360 - 7x + 44
360 - 7x + 44 = 205
404 - 7x = 205
7x = 199
x = 199/7 = 28.428

Let us assume the given measures are central angles. In circle P, the central angle is 155 degrees. This corresponds to the arc RS. In circle Q, the central angle is 7x - 44. Since the circles are congruent, and we are only given the arc measures, let's relate the central angles to the arcs. The arc RS corresponds to a central angle of 155 degrees. The arc TU corresponds to a central angle of 7x - 44. We do not know what the arc and the central angle is from R around the circle to U. 
Let's try setting the central angles equal. 
155 = 7x - 44
7x = 199
x = 28.42
