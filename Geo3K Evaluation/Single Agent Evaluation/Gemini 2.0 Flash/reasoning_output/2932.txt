QUESTION:
For trapezoid A B C D, S and T are midpoints of the legs. If C D = 14, S T = 10, and A B = 2 x, find x.

CHOICES:
A. 2
B. 3
C. 10
D. 14

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let A, B, C, D be the vertices of the trapezoid.
Let S and T be the midpoints of the legs AC and BD, respectively.
We are given that CD = 14, ST = 10, and AB = 2x.
We know that the length of the midsegment of a trapezoid is the average of the lengths of the bases.
Thus, ST = (AB + CD) / 2.
Substituting the given values, we have
10 = (2x + 14) / 2
Multiplying both sides by 2, we get
20 = 2x + 14
Subtracting 14 from both sides, we get
6 = 2x
Dividing by 2, we get
x = 3
The value of x is 3.

Final Answer: B
