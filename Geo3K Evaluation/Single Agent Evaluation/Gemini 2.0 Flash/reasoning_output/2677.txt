The image shows a polygon ABCDE. The small tick marks on each side indicate that all the sides are equal in length. Since there are 5 sides, the polygon is a pentagon. The perimeter of the pentagon is given as 60 centimeters. Let $s$ be the length of each side. Since all sides are equal, the perimeter is $5s$. We have $5s = 60$. Dividing both sides by 5, we get $s = \frac{60}{5} = 12$ centimeters. Therefore, the length of each side of the polygon is 12 centimeters.
