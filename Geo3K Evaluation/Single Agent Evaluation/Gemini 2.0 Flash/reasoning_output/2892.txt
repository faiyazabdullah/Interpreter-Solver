Let X, Y, and Z be the vertices of the triangle. Let J, K, and L be the midpoints of the sides YZ, XZ, and XY, respectively.
Since P is the centroid of the triangle, P is the intersection of the medians XJ, YK, and ZL.
We are given that KP = 3. Since P is the centroid, we know that the centroid divides each median in a 2:1 ratio. Therefore, YP = 2 * KP = 2 * 3 = 6. So, YK = YP + KP = 6 + 3 = 9.
Since K is the midpoint of XZ, we are given that XJ = 8. We are asked to find YJ. Since J is the midpoint of YZ, XJ is a median. The median connects a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. We are not given that triangle XYZ is a special type of triangle such as an isosceles or equilateral. So, YJ cannot be determined from the information given. However, in triangle XYZ, since P is the centroid, we know that XJ is a median. The problem states XJ = 8 and asks us to find YJ. The length of a median to a side is not related to the length of that side in general.
But if the question is in \triangle XYZ, P is the centroid, XJ = 8. Find XJ. Then the answer would be 8.
If the question is in \triangle XYZ, P is the centroid, XJ = 8, find YJ = ?
Since P is the centroid, we know that XJ is a median from X to the midpoint J of YZ.
We have XJ = 8. We don't have any information about the length of the sides of the triangle. Since J is the midpoint of YZ, YJ = JZ.
Therefore, it is not possible to determine YJ without additional information.

The given information KP = 3 is useless for finding YJ.
