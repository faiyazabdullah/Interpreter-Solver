GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The given figure is a quadrilateral with diagonals intersecting each other. For a quadrilateral to be a parallelogram, its diagonals must bisect each other. This means the point where the diagonals intersect, labeled as E, divides each diagonal into two equal segments. Therefore, we can set the lengths of the two segments of each diagonal equal to each other.

The length of one segment of diagonal DB is given as $x + 4$, and the other segment is given as $3x - 6$. We can set these equal:
$x + 4 = 3x - 6$

Now, solve for $x$:
$4 + 6 = 3x - x$
$10 = 2x$
$x = 5$

We found that $x=5$. Now compare this value with the answer choices.

Final Answer: B
