QUESTION:
Find the perimeter of the figure. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.

CHOICES:
A. 20
B. 21
C. 24
D. 25

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The figure has sides of length 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2.
The perimeter is 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 28
However, the inner rectangle subtracts a length of 2 on the top and bottom sides, and 2 on the left and right sides.
The perimeter of the figure is 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 28.

The perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all the sides.
Perimeter = 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 28.

None of the answer choices are 28. Let's look at the image again to see if we missed anything.
The outer rectangle has sides of length 5 and 5. The inner rectangle has sides of length 2 and 2.
The lengths of the sides are 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 2, 2, 2.
The perimeter of the figure is 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 28.

The image looks like a rectangle with another rectangle cut out of it. The outer rectangle has sides of length 5 and 5. The inner rectangle has sides of length 2 and 2. The perimeter is the sum of the lengths of the sides.
Perimeter = 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 28.
The answer choices are A. 20, B. 21, C. 24, D. 25.
It seems there is an error in the problem or the image, as the correct answer is 28, which is not in the answer choices.
Since we have to choose from the given answers, we will choose the closest one to our calculated perimeter, which is 25.
