QUESTION:
Use rectangle L M N P, parallelogram L K M J to solve the problem. If L N = 10, L J = 2 x + 1, and P J = 3 x - 1, find x.

CHOICES:
A. 2
B. 4
C. 5
D. 10

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
In rectangle L M N P, the diagonals are equal in length and bisect each other. Therefore, L N = P M = 10.
Since L M N P is a rectangle, L N and P M bisect each other. Thus, L J = P J = 1/2 * P M.
Since P M = 10, L J = P J = 1/2 * 10 = 5.
We are given that L J = 2 x + 1 and P J = 3 x - 1.
Since L J = 5, we have 2 x + 1 = 5.
Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get 2 x = 4.
Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 2.
Since P J = 5, we have 3 x - 1 = 5.
Adding 1 to both sides, we get 3 x = 6.
Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 2.
Therefore, x = 2.
