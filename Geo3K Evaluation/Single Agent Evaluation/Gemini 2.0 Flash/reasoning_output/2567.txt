The quadrilateral EFGH is a rectangle. Therefore, \angle HGF is a right angle, meaning it measures 90 degrees. We are given that the measure of \angle HGE is 13 degrees. We want to find the measure of \angle FGE.

Since \angle HGF is formed by \angle HGE and \angle FGE, we can write the equation:
m\angle HGF = m\angle HGE + m\angle FGE

We know that m\angle HGF = 90 degrees and m\angle HGE = 13 degrees. Plugging these values into the equation, we get:
90 = 13 + m\angle FGE

To solve for m\angle FGE, we subtract 13 from both sides of the equation:
m\angle FGE = 90 - 13
m\angle FGE = 77

Therefore, the measure of \angle FGE is 77 degrees.
