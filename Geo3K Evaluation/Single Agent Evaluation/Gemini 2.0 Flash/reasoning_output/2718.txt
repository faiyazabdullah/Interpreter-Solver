The image shows a triangle DEF, with DG being a perpendicular line from D to EF. This creates a right angle DGE. We are given that angle E is 25 degrees and angle F is 65 degrees. The question asks for the measure of angle 1.

In triangle DGF, angle DGF is a right angle (90 degrees), and angle F is 65 degrees. Therefore, angle 2 can be found using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees:
angle 2 = 180 - (90 + 65) = 180 - 155 = 25 degrees.

Now, consider triangle DEG. Angle DGE is a right angle (90 degrees), and angle E is 25 degrees. Therefore, angle 1 can be found using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees:
angle 1 = 180 - (90 + 25) = 180 - 115 = 65 degrees.
