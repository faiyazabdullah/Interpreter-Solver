QUESTION:
The ratio of the measure of the angles of the triangle below is 3 : 2 : 1. Which of the following is not an angle measure of the triangle?

CHOICES:
A. 30
B. 45
C. 60
D. 90

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let the measures of the angles be $3x$, $2x$, and $x$.
The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
Therefore, $3x + 2x + x = 180$.
$6x = 180$
$x = \frac{180}{6} = 30$
The angles are $3x = 3(30) = 90$, $2x = 2(30) = 60$, and $x = 30$.
The angle measures are 30, 60, and 90.

We are looking for the angle measure that is NOT an angle measure of the triangle.
The answer choices are A. 30, B. 45, C. 60, D. 90.
The angle measures of the triangle are 30, 60, and 90.
A. 30 is an angle measure of the triangle.
B. 45 is NOT an angle measure of the triangle.
C. 60 is an angle measure of the triangle.
D. 90 is an angle measure of the triangle.
