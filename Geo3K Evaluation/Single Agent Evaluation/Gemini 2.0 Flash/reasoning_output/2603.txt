Let HS, JR, KQ, and LP be parallel lines. Then, triangle HSM is similar to triangle JKM, triangle HSR is similar to triangle JQR, triangle HSQ is similar to triangle JKR, etc.
Given that LK = 4, MP = 3, PQ = 6, KJ = 2, RS = 6, and LP = 2. We need to find JH.

Since HS || JR || KQ || LP, by the triangle proportionality theorem, we have the following proportions:

HS/RS = JH/JR = JK/KQ = JL/LP
JM/MP = MK/KQ = ML/LP

From LP = 2, PQ = 6, MP = 3, we have MQ = MP + PQ = 3 + 6 = 9.
Also, since LK = 4, KJ = 2, we have LJ = LK + KJ = 4 + 2 = 6.

Since LP || KQ || JR || HS, we can write the similar triangles:
Triangle HSM ~ JRM ~ KQM ~ LPM

We have L P = 2, L K = 4, and K J = 2.
So, L J = LK + KJ = 4 + 2 = 6. Also, JK = 2, so J L / L K = 6/4 = 3/2.

Let JH = x.
Then, we know KJ = 2. Therefore, HK = x+2. Since JH / HS = JK / KQ = JL / LP, and
Also, SR/RM = HJ/JL = JH/(LK+KJ) = JH/(4+2) = x/6.

Also, since MP = 3, and PQ = 6. The base of the triangle is SM, where MR = MP + PQ + QR + RS + SR
Then, consider triangle H M S.

Consider the parallel lines with the proportions.
Since LP = 2, PQ = 6, MQ = 9, and RS = 6.
KJ/JH = QP/PM and then QH/HS = KQ/SR.

We also have LP/PM = KQ/QM.

From the similar triangles, we have $\frac{JH}{RS} = \frac{JL}{SM}$

Let's consider the ratio JH/KJ = RS/SQ
So we also have  H J / J K = S R / R Q

The proportional sides are H J / JK = J K / L K and also  LP / L K = P Q / Q R
J H / J K = R S / S Q

Consider H J / J K = S R / R Q =>

Also we are given LK=4, MP=3, PQ=6, KJ=2, RS=6, LP=2
If H J / J K = K L / L M... and we see that we can derive the answer from this and the rest of our ratios...
So let us look into the ratio H J / J K = R S / R Q

H J / J K = K L / L M
so now using J R || KP,  J K = K L
H J / J K = R S / S Q
 H J / 2 = 6 / 6
H J / 2 = 1 -> H J = 2;
