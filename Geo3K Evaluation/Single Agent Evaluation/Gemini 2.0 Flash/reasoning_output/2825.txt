In \odot P, J K = 10 and \widehat J K L = 134. We want to find m \widehat J L.
Since \widehat J K L = 134, then m \angle J P L = 134.
Since J K = 10, the triangle formed by connecting points J, P, and K is an isosceles triangle if P is the center of the circle. Let's assume P is the center of the circle.
If J K = 10, we are given that P is the center of the circle and J K = 10 is the length of the chord. Q is the point on J K where P Q is perpendicular to J K. Therefore Q is the midpoint of J K, so J Q = Q K = 5.
Since P Q is perpendicular to J K, \angle P Q J = 90 degrees.
The information J K = 10 is not relevant to finding m \widehat J L.
Given \widehat J K L = 134. We are looking for the measure of the arc J L.
\widehat J K L = \widehat J L + \widehat L K = 134.
We don't have the information to find \widehat L K directly.
We are given that J K = 10. We also have that P Q is perpendicular to J K.
Let \widehat J K = x.
The full circle measures 360 degrees.
We are given \widehat J K L = 134.
We need to find m \widehat J L.
Let m \widehat J L = y.
\widehat J K L = m \widehat J K + m \widehat K L = 134
We cannot solve for m \widehat J L with the information provided.
However, let us consider the case where the arc JKL is a semicircle. Then the angle JKL would be inscribed in the semi-circle and be 90 degrees.
Given m \widehat J K L = 134. This is the major arc. So the minor arc J L measures 360 - 134 = 226. Then this is impossible, because we are supposed to find m \widehat J L.
However, if J K L is an arc, then the arc measure JKL is 134 degrees. The inscribed angle theorem states that the inscribed angle J K L is half the central angle J P L, where P is the center of the circle.
Then m \angle J K L = \frac{1}{2} m \widehat J L.
Also, we know that m \widehat J K L = 134. Let m \widehat J L = x.
Then m \widehat J K + m \widehat K L = 134.
Let m \angle J K L = \theta.
Then \theta = \frac{1}{2} x. So m \widehat J L = 2 \theta.
We cannot find the answer with the given information.
If the angle at P is right angle, then it equals 90 degrees. In that case the arc J L measures 90 degrees.
Since angle P Q J is a right angle, it doesn't mean arc J L is a quarter of circle.
However, if \widehat J K L = 134, let us assume that we are talking about the major arc. The minor arc would be 360 - 134 = 226 degrees. We are supposed to find m \widehat J L.
Therefore, there may be something wrong with the description.
