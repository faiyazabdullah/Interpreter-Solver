The image shows a parallelogram with a base of 13 yards and a side length of 10 yards. The angle at vertex B is 45 degrees. To find the area of the parallelogram, we need to determine its height. The height (DE) forms a right triangle with side DB and angle B.

Since angle B is 45 degrees, triangle DBE is a 45-45-90 triangle. However, we are given the side length of the parallelogram as 10 yards, which is AD. Since angle B is 45 degrees, we can use trigonometry to find the height (DE).

sin(45°) = height / side length
sin(45°) = DE / 10
DE = 10 * sin(45°)
DE = 10 * (sqrt(2)/2)
DE = 5 * sqrt(2)
DE ≈ 5 * 1.414
DE ≈ 7.07

The area of the parallelogram is base * height.
Area = 13 * 7.07
Area ≈ 91.91

Rounding to the nearest tenth, the area is approximately 91.9 square yards.
