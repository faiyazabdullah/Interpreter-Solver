Let $\angle A = 15^{\circ}$, $\angle EFA = 95^{\circ}$.
Let $\angle A = 10^{\circ}$.
We are given that $\angle A = 15^{\circ}$ and we want to find $\angle B$.

By the tangent-chord theorem, $\angle AEF = \angle EJG$.
In triangle $AEG$, $\angle A + \angle AEG + \angle AGE = 180^{\circ}$.
Since $AFEC$ is a cyclic quadrilateral, we have $\angle C = 180^{\circ} - \angle AFE = 180^{\circ} - 95^{\circ} = 85^{\circ}$.
In triangle $ABG$, $\angle A + \angle B + \angle AGB = 180^{\circ}$.
Consider quadrilateral $CDGE$. $\angle D + \angle C + \angle G + \angle E = 360^{\circ}$.
$\angle A = 15^{\circ}$, so we have $\angle AEJ = 15^{\circ}$. Then $\angle FEJ = 180^{\circ}$.
Given $m \angle A = 10^{\circ}$.
From the image, points A, E, and G are collinear, and points A, J, and G are collinear.
Therefore, triangle $AEJ$ exists.
Also points C, D, and B are collinear, and points G, D, and B are collinear.
Therefore, triangle $CDG$ exists.

If $\angle A = 10^{\circ}$, we want to find $\angle B$.
Without more information, we cannot determine the exact value of $\angle B$.
Let's assume that $\angle A$ is much smaller than $90^{\circ}$, so $\angle A < 90^{\circ}$.

If we assume $\angle A = 10^{\circ}$, the closest value of $\angle B$ would be $35^{\circ}$.
Without knowing more relationships between the angles, we cannot find the exact measure of $\angle B$.
