QUESTION:
For trapezoid Q R T U, V and S are midpoints of the legs. If Q R = 4 and U T = 16, find V S.

CHOICES:
A. 5
B. 9
C. 10
D. 12

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
V and S are the midpoints of the legs of trapezoid QRTU. This means that VS is the midsegment (or median) of the trapezoid. The midsegment of a trapezoid is parallel to the bases and its length is the average of the lengths of the bases.

Given that QR = 4 and UT = 16, we can find VS using the formula:

VS = (QR + UT) / 2

VS = (4 + 16) / 2
VS = 20 / 2
VS = 10

Therefore, the length of VS is 10.
