Given FL = 24 and HJ = 48.
Also, ML is perpendicular to FG, and MN is perpendicular to HJ.
Since ML is perpendicular to FG, FL = LG = 24, so FG = 2*24 = 48.
Since MN is perpendicular to HJ, HN = NJ = 48/2 = 24.
Since FG = HJ = 48, the arcs subtended by them are equal, i.e., arc(FHG) = arc(HPJ).
Thus, arc(FG) = arc(HJ).
We are given that m(arc HP) = 65 degrees.
We need to find m(arc PJ).
Since HJ = 48, and HN = NJ = 24, then MN is perpendicular to HJ, and MN bisects HJ. Thus, arc(HN) = arc(NJ).
Also, since arc(HPJ) = arc(HP) + arc(PJ), and arc(HN) + arc(NJ) = arc(HJ), then 2*arc(NJ) = arc(HJ).
However, since FG = HJ, m(arc FG) = m(arc HJ).
We are given m(arc HP) = 65. Let x = m(arc PJ).
Since arc(HJ) = arc(HP) + arc(PJ), then m(arc HJ) = m(arc HP) + m(arc PJ) = 65 + x.
Since HN = NJ, m(arc HN) = m(arc NJ).
Also, since m(arc HJ) = m(arc HN) + m(arc NJ) = 2*m(arc NJ), then 65 + x = 2*m(arc NJ).
We also know that since FG = HJ, then m(arc FG) = m(arc HJ) = 65 + x.
Also, since arc(HPJ) = arc(FHG), then arc(HP) + arc(PJ) = arc(FH) + arc(HG).
Since ML is perpendicular to FG, FL = LG, thus arc(FK) = arc(GK).
Since MN is perpendicular to HJ, HN = NJ, thus arc(HI) = arc(JI).
Since HJ = FG = 48, then arc HJ = arc FG. So arc HP + arc PJ = arc FG.
m(arc HP) + m(arc PJ) = m(arc FG)
65 + x = arc FG.

We are given that ML is perpendicular to FG and MN is perpendicular to HJ.
This implies that FG and HJ are equidistant from the center. Hence arc(FG) = arc(HJ).
Therefore, m arc(FG) = m arc(HJ). Also, we know arc(HJ) = arc(HP) + arc(PJ).
Thus, arc(HJ) = 65 + m arc(PJ).
However, it doesn't appear that we can deduce anything further from this information.
There is no other relationship between these arcs to directly determine the value of arc(PJ) without making additional assumptions which may not be true. We are also given FL = 24, and HJ = 48.
However, this does not help.

In \odot M, F L = 24, H J = 48, and m \widehat H P = 65. Find m \widehat P J.
Since FL = 24 and HJ = 48, and given m \widehat{HP} = 65.
Also ML perp FG and MN perp HJ, then FG = 2FL = 2 * 24 = 48 = HJ.
Since FG = HJ, then m \widehat{FG} = m \widehat{HJ}, m \widehat{HP} + m \widehat{PJ} = m \widehat{HJ}.
Then, m \widehat{PJ} = m \widehat{HJ} - m \widehat{HP} = m \widehat{HJ} - 65.
Cannot determine value without knowing more about m arc HJ.

There must be additional assumptions about relationship between the arcs, however it is not explicitly stated, we will choose the closest number out of the possible choices.
If m arc PJ = 65, then the triangles are congruent, therefore by central angle theorems the arcs are the same.
