The image shows a right triangle ABC, where angle C is 90 degrees and angle B is 30 degrees. The length of side BC is given as 14 * sqrt(3). We need to find the length of side AC, which is denoted as x.

Since we have a 30-60-90 triangle, we know the side ratios are 1:sqrt(3):2. The side opposite the 30-degree angle is half the length of the hypotenuse.  The side adjacent to the 30-degree angle is sqrt(3)/2 times the length of the hypotenuse.

In this case, BC is adjacent to the 30-degree angle, and AC is opposite the 30-degree angle. Thus,
BC = AC * sqrt(3)
14 * sqrt(3) = x * sqrt(3)

Dividing both sides by sqrt(3):
x = 14

So, the length of AC is 14.
