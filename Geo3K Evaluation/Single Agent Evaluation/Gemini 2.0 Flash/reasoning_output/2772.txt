The measure of angle Y is given as 68 degrees.
The measure of major arc WX is given as 224 degrees.
We need to find the measure of arc XZ.
The measure of angle Y is half the difference between the intercepted arcs.
m∠Y = (1/2) |m(arc WZ) - m(arc XZ)|
Since the total circle measure is 360 degrees,
m(arc WX) + m(arc XZ) + m(arc WZ) = 360
224 + m(arc XZ) + m(arc WZ) = 360
m(arc WZ) = 360 - 224 - m(arc XZ)
m(arc WZ) = 136 - m(arc XZ)
Substituting this into the angle Y equation:
68 = (1/2) |136 - m(arc XZ) - m(arc XZ)|
68 = (1/2) |136 - 2 * m(arc XZ)|
136 = |136 - 2 * m(arc XZ)|
We have two possibilities:
1) 136 = 136 - 2 * m(arc XZ)
2 * m(arc XZ) = 0
m(arc XZ) = 0
This solution is not possible since X and Z are distinct points.
2) 136 = -(136 - 2 * m(arc XZ))
136 = -136 + 2 * m(arc XZ)
272 = 2 * m(arc XZ)
m(arc XZ) = 136
However, the tangents BX and DZ create a point outside the circle, and angle Y formed by these tangents,
m∠Y = 1/2 * |m(arc XZ) - m(arc W)| where W is replaced by WZ
So,  68 = 1/2 (major arc WX - arc XZ)
68 = 1/2 |m(arc XZ) - m(arc WZ)|
Given major arc WX is 224, minor arc WX is 360-224=136
arc WZ = 360 - mXZ - 136 = 224 - mXZ
68 = 1/2 |mXZ - (224- mXZ)| = 1/2|2mXZ -224|
136= 2|mXZ - 112|
68= |mXZ-112|
mXZ = 112+68=180 or 112-68=44
Since WZ is 360 -WX - XZ
arc WZ = 360 - m(arc XZ) - 224 = 136- arcXZ
m∠Y = (1/2)(WX arc - arcXZ) => 2 m∠Y = WZ -arcXZ
360 =arc WZ + arc WX + arc ZY

Consider this problem as the measure of the intercepted arc is XZ, so use circle theorem
measure Y = 68 = 1/2( arc between X,Z which is (360-(XY+YZ))
68=1/2 (360 degrees between these points)

In a circle with tangents, the measure of the angle formed at the point outside the circle is half the difference between the intercepted arcs, therefore, mXZ = 2 m∠Y =
YZ and
