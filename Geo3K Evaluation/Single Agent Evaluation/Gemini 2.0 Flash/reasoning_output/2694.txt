In parallelogram $MNPR$, we are asked to find $m\angle MNP$.
We are given that $m\angle MRP = 38^{\circ}$. Since $MNPR$ is a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. Therefore, $m\angle MNP = m\angle MRP = 38^{\circ}$. This corresponds to answer choice B.

However, we also know that consecutive angles in a parallelogram are supplementary, meaning that they add up to $180^\circ$. So, $m\angle NMR + m\angle MRP = 180^\circ$. Also, $m\angle MNP + m\angle NPR = 180^\circ$.

From the image, we are given that $\angle QNP = 33^\circ$. Since the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other, we have that $QN$ is a transversal cutting parallel lines $MN$ and $RP$.
Also, $m\angle QRP = 3z-3 = 38^{\circ}$, so $3z = 41$, and $z = \frac{41}{3}$.
Since $MNPR$ is a parallelogram, $MN \parallel RP$ and $MR \parallel NP$. We are given that $\angle MRP = 38^{\circ}$ and $\angle QNP = 33^{\circ}$. Therefore, $\angle MNP = \angle MRP$.
However, we have that $\angle MNP = \angle PNQ + \angle MNQ$.
We also have $\angle QRP = \angle MNQ$ (alternate interior angles), so $\angle MNQ = 38^{\circ}$.
So $m\angle MNP = m\angle QNP + m\angle MNQ = 33^{\circ} + 38^{\circ} = 71^{\circ}$.

The angles $MRP$ and $MNP$ are opposite angles in a parallelogram, so they must be equal. However, in this case, they are not equal.
Given $\angle QNP = 33^\circ$, we need to find $\angle MNQ$. We know that $m\angle R = 38^{\circ}$.
Also $3z-3 = 38$, thus $3z = 41$, so $z = 41/3$.
In triangle $NQP$, $\angle NQP = 83^{\circ}$, and $\angle QNP = 33^{\circ}$, so $\angle QPN = 180 - (83+33) = 180 - 116 = 64^{\circ}$.
Since $MN || PR$, we know that $\angle MNQ = \angle R = 38$.
So $\angle MNP = \angle MNQ + \angle QNP = 38 + 33 = 71$.
