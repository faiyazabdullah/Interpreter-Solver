Let the circle be centered at O. Let the intersection of line AE and line BH be P.
The measure of the intercepted arc by the angle that measures $85^\circ$ is $85^\circ$.
The measure of the other intercepted arc is $230^\circ$. The sum of the measures of the arcs is $85^\circ + 230^\circ = 315^\circ$. This means that the other arc measures $360^\circ - 315^\circ = 45^\circ$.
Let the intersection of line AI and the circle be F, and the intersection of line BH and the circle be H.
$m \angle IPH = \frac{1}{2} (m \stackrel{\frown}{FH} - m \stackrel{\frown}{AD})$
Since the arc measures $85^\circ$ and $230^\circ$, the angle formed outside the circle is:
$m \angle IPH = \frac{1}{2}(230^\circ - 85^\circ) = \frac{1}{2}(145^\circ) = 72.5^\circ$
Also, $m \angle 1 = m \angle IPH = 72.5^\circ$
Then $m \angle 2$ is an exterior angle to the triangle formed by the intersection point P, the point A, and the center G of the circle. $m \angle 2 = m \angle 1 + m \angle GPA$.
Since we don't have any information about the exact locations of the points on the circle, we can't find the exact value of $m \angle 2$.
However, the problem statement tells us to assume that segments that appear tangent are tangent. Let's assume that AI and BH are tangent to the circle.
Let's consider the case where the angle of $85^\circ$ is formed by two tangents.
Then $m \angle IPH = \frac{1}{2} (m \stackrel{\frown}{ADH} - m \stackrel{\frown}{AF})$
$85^\circ = \frac{1}{2} (x - (360^\circ - x)) = \frac{1}{2} (2x - 360^\circ)$
$170^\circ = 2x - 360^\circ$
$530^\circ = 2x$
$x = 265^\circ$
$m \angle 2 = \frac{1}{2} (m \stackrel{\frown}{AEH}) = \frac{1}{2}(85^\circ+230^\circ)=\frac{1}{2}(2(265^\circ/2))$
$x=265^\circ$
$2x-360=170 \to 2x=530 \to x=265$.
$265-360+85 = 230 + 355 - 360 = 265$
The intercepted arcs are $85^\circ$ and $230^\circ$, and $m \angle 2$ is the angle formed by the intersection of the transversal line at point A. Therefore, the intercepted arc is $85^\circ$. Then the inscribed angle is $\frac{85^\circ}{2} = 42.5^\circ$.
Since $m \angle 2$ and $42.5^\circ$ are supplementary, then $m \angle 2 = 180^\circ - 42.5^\circ = 137.5^\circ$.
However, this doesn't match any of the answer choices.

However, let's consider the angle formed by the intersecting chords. Then the angle is the average of the intercepted arcs. So, $m \angle 2 = \frac{85^\circ + 230^\circ}{2} = \frac{315^\circ}{2} = 157.5^\circ$.
