Since BF bisects angle ABC, we have angle ABF = angle CBF. Also, since AC is parallel to ED, we have angle ACB = angle CDB.
Since AC || ED, triangle BDE is similar to triangle BAC. Therefore, BD/BC = DE/AC = BE/BA.
We are given BA = 6, BC = 7.5, AC = 9, DE = 9.
So, BD/7.5 = 9/9 = 1. Therefore, BD = 7.5.
Since BD = BC = 7.5, triangle BCD is an isosceles triangle, so angle BCD = angle BDC.
Since AC || ED, we have angle ACB = angle EDB. Also, angle BAC = angle BED.
Since BF is the angle bisector of angle ABC, by the angle bisector theorem, we have BA/BC = AF/FC.
So, 6/7.5 = AF/FC. Therefore, 6FC = 7.5AF, which means 4FC = 5AF.
Also, AF + FC = AC = 9. Substituting AF = (4/5)FC, we have (4/5)FC + FC = 9.
(9/5)FC = 9, so FC = 5.
Alternatively, since BA/BC = AF/FC, we have 6/7.5 = AF/FC. Thus, AF = (6/7.5)FC = (4/5)FC.
Since AF + FC = 9, we have (4/5)FC + FC = 9, which simplifies to (9/5)FC = 9. Thus, FC = 5.
