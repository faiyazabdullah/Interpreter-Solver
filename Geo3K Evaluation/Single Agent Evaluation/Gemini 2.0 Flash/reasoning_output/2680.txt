The problem requires us to find the measure of angle 4.
From the diagram, we can see that angle 4 is formed by the intersection of two chords inside the circle. The measure of an angle formed by two chords that intersect inside a circle is equal to one-half the sum of the intercepted arcs.
In this case, angle 4 intercepts arc ST and arc RU. The measures of arc ST and arc RU are given as 51 degrees and 92 degrees respectively.
Therefore, the measure of angle 4 is given by:
m \angle 4 = \frac{1}{2}(m \arc{RU} + m \arc{ST})
m \angle 4 = \frac{1}{2}(92 + 51)
m \angle 4 = \frac{1}{2}(143)
m \angle 4 = 71.5

Comparing this result with the answer choices, we find that it matches with choice C.
