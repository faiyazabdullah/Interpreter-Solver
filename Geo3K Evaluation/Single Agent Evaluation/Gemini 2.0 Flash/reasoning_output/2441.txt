Given that m \angle 3 = 110^{\circ} and m \angle 12 = 55^{\circ}.
We want to find the measure of \angle 1.

We can see that \angle 3 and \angle 7 are supplementary angles, which means that m \angle 3 + m \angle 7 = 180^{\circ}.
Since m \angle 3 = 110^{\circ}, we have 110^{\circ} + m \angle 7 = 180^{\circ}.
Therefore, m \angle 7 = 180^{\circ} - 110^{\circ} = 70^{\circ}.

Also, \angle 7 and \angle 11 are consecutive interior angles. If lines DB and JL are parallel, then m \angle 7 + m \angle 11 = 180^{\circ}.
However, we have m \angle 12 = 55^{\circ}, and \angle 11 and \angle 12 are supplementary angles. So, m \angle 11 + m \angle 12 = 180^{\circ}.
Therefore, m \angle 11 = 180^{\circ} - m \angle 12 = 180^{\circ} - 55^{\circ} = 125^{\circ}.
Since m \angle 7 = 70^{\circ} and m \angle 11 = 125^{\circ}, m \angle 7 + m \angle 11 = 70^{\circ} + 125^{\circ} = 195^{\circ} \ne 180^{\circ}.
Thus, lines DB and JL are not parallel.

\angle 1 and \angle 5 are supplementary angles, so m \angle 1 + m \angle 5 = 180^{\circ}.
\angle 5 and \angle 7 are corresponding angles. If lines DB and JL are parallel, then m \angle 5 = m \angle 7.
However, we know that lines DB and JL are not parallel, so m \angle 5 \ne m \angle 7.
Also, \angle 3 and \angle 11 are interior angles on the same side.
If line CF is parallel to line EG, then m \angle 3 + m \angle 12 = 180.
However, 110 + 55 = 165. So the lines are not parallel.

We can see that \angle 1 and \angle 5 are supplementary, so m \angle 1 + m \angle 5 = 180^\circ. Also, \angle 5 and \angle 7 are corresponding angles, so if DB || JL then \angle 5 = \angle 7. But \angle 7 = 180^\circ - 110^\circ = 70^\circ. Therefore, if DB || JL then \angle 5 = 70^\circ and \angle 1 = 180^\circ - 70^\circ = 110^\circ.
\angle 12 and \angle 4 are corresponding angles. Since DB || JL, then \angle 4 = \angle 12 = 55^\circ. But since \angle 3 = 110^\circ and \angle 3 and \angle 4 are supplementary, \angle 4 = 180 - 110 = 70^\circ.
Therefore, DB is not parallel to JL.

The problem asks to find m\angle 1. We are given that m\angle 3 = 110 degrees and m\angle 12 = 55 degrees.
We know that \angle 1 and \angle 2 are supplementary, as are \angle 3 and \angle 4. Also \angle 11 and \angle 12 are supplementary.
From the given information, we can't find a direct relationship between \angle 1 and the other angles.
However, let's assume DB || JL, then corresponding angles \angle 4 = \angle 12, so \angle 4 = 55. Also \angle 3 + \angle 4 = 180, so \angle 3 = 125, a contradiction.

If m\angle 1 = 55, then \angle 5 = 125. If m\angle 1 = 110, then \angle 5 = 70.
