The figure shows a semicircle with three smaller semicircles cut out. The diameter of the large semicircle is 15. So, the radius of the large semicircle is 15/2 = 7.5. The area of the large semicircle is (1/2) * pi * (7.5)^2 = (1/2) * pi * 56.25 = 28.125 * pi.
Since the three smaller semicircles are congruent, they have the same diameter. The three diameters add up to the diameter of the large semicircle, which is 15. Thus, the diameter of each small semicircle is 15/3 = 5.
The radius of each small semicircle is 5/2 = 2.5. The area of each small semicircle is (1/2) * pi * (2.5)^2 = (1/2) * pi * 6.25 = 3.125 * pi.
Since there are three small semicircles, their combined area is 3 * 3.125 * pi = 9.375 * pi.
The area of the shaded region is the area of the large semicircle minus the area of the three small semicircles. This is (28.125 * pi) - (9.375 * pi) = 18.75 * pi.
Now, we use the approximation pi = 3.14159 to find the area: 18.75 * 3.14159 = 58.9048125.
Rounding to the nearest tenth, we get 58.9.
