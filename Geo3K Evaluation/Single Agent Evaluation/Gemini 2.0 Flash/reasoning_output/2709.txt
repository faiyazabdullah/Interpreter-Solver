The problem provides that circle J has a radius of 10 units and circle K has a radius of 8 units. Also, BC = 5.4 units. We need to find CK. Since K is the center of the circle and D is a point on the circle, KD is a radius of circle K. Therefore, KD = 8. Similarly, KC is also a radius of circle K, and KC = 8.

From the figure, we can see that C, K, and D are collinear and K is between C and D. Therefore, CK + KD = CD. Since KD is a radius of circle K, KD = 8. Thus, CD = KC = 8.
We are looking for CK, and from the diagram, C, K and D are collinear. Since K is the center of the circle with radius 8, we have KD = KC = 8.
Since KC = 8, we are looking for CK. Since C, K and D are collinear, CK + KD = CD. But KC = KD = 8, we know that C is not the center. Therefore, KD = 8. KC = 8, so CK is also a radius and is therefore equal to 8.

Since KC = 8, then CK = 8. However, BC = 5.4. We need to find CK. K is the center of the circle, thus KC = 8, since KC is the radius. KC = CK = 8. We are given that BC = 5.4.
Then BK = BC + CK, so BK = 5.4 + CK. If CK = 2.6, then BK = 5.4 + 2.6 = 8.

Let's consider the case where K is the center of the circle on the right. The length of the radius is 8. Thus, KC = 8. Let CK = x.
Since KC = 8, CK = 8 - KC. CK = KD = radius = 8. KC is not radius. Therefore, CK + KC = radius. We are given the radius is 8. We need to find CK. KC = 8 is incorrect.
Consider the options:
A. 2.4: If CK = 2.4, KC = 8. So, C is not center.
B. 2.6: If CK = 2.6, then KC = radius = 8. C is not the center.
C. 2.8: If CK = 2.8, then KC = radius = 8. C is not the center.
D. 4: If CK = 4, then KC = radius = 8. C is not the center.

If CK = x. KC = 8.
We have BC = 5.4. BK = BC + CK = 5.4 + x. Thus, 5.4 + x + 8 = radius = 8.
If C is between K and D, then KC + CD = KD = radius. KC is not radius. Therefore, if CK is a radius, CK = 8. However, KC is not radius. The radius of the right circle is 8, and KC is a radius. Let CK = x. We are given BC = 5.4. So BK = BC + CK = 5.4 + x. K is the center so BK would need to be the radius. So 5.4 + x = 8. So x = 8 - 5.4 = 2.6
