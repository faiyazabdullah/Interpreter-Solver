The image shows a decagon circumscribed about a circle with radius 21. The shaded region is the area between the decagon and the circle. The area of the shaded region is the area of the decagon minus the area of the circle.

The decagon consists of 10 congruent triangles, each with base equal to the side length of the decagon and height equal to the radius of the circle. Let $s$ be the side length of the decagon. Let $r$ be the radius of the inscribed circle. Then $r = 21$.
The area of the circle is $A_{circle} = \pi r^2 = \pi (21^2) = 441\pi \approx 1385.4$.

Since the decagon is circumscribed about the circle, the radius of the inscribed circle is the apothem of the decagon. The apothem is $a = 21$.
Let $n$ be the number of sides of the polygon, $n=10$. The area of a regular polygon is given by
$A = \frac{1}{2} a P$ where $a$ is the apothem and $P$ is the perimeter.
We need to find the perimeter of the decagon.
The central angle of the decagon is $\frac{2\pi}{10} = \frac{\pi}{5}$. Half of the central angle is $\frac{\pi}{10}$.
$\tan(\frac{\pi}{10}) = \frac{s/2}{a} = \frac{s}{2a}$. Thus $s = 2a \tan(\frac{\pi}{10}) = 2(21)\tan(\frac{\pi}{10}) = 42 \tan(\frac{\pi}{10})$.
The perimeter is $P = 10s = 10(42 \tan(\frac{\pi}{10})) = 420 \tan(\frac{\pi}{10}) \approx 420(0.3249) = 136.458$.
The area of the decagon is $A_{decagon} = \frac{1}{2} a P = \frac{1}{2}(21)(420 \tan(\frac{\pi}{10})) = (21)(210) \tan(\frac{\pi}{10}) = 4410 \tan(\frac{\pi}{10}) \approx 4410(0.3249) \approx 1433$.
$A_{shaded} = A_{decagon} - A_{circle} = 1433 - 1385.4 = 47.6$

If we assume the given number 21 is the side length of the decagon, then we can find the area using the formula $A = \frac{5}{2} a s = \frac{5}{2} a (21)$, and we need to find $a$. In this case, $\tan(\frac{\pi}{10}) = \frac{s/2}{a}$, so $a = \frac{s}{2\tan(\pi/10)} = \frac{21}{2\tan(\pi/10)} \approx \frac{21}{2(0.3249)} = \frac{21}{0.6498} = 32.318$.
Then $A_{decagon} = \frac{1}{2} a P = \frac{1}{2} (32.318) (10 \cdot 21) = \frac{1}{2}(32.318)(210) = (32.318)(105) = 3393.39$.
Then $A_{shaded} = 3393.39 - 1385.44 = 2007.95$.

The image indicates that the radius of the inscribed circle is 21.
Area of the shaded region = Area of Decagon - Area of circle.
Area of Circle = $\pi r^2 = \pi (21)^2 = 441\pi \approx 1385.4$.
Area of Decagon = $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{perimeter} \times \text{apothem} = \frac{1}{2} (10s) (21) = 105s$.
where $s$ is the side length.
Also, $\tan(\frac{\pi}{10}) = \frac{s/2}{21} = \frac{s}{42}$, so $s = 42 \tan(\frac{\pi}{10}) \approx 42(0.3249) = 13.6458$.
Area of the decagon = $105s = 105(13.6458) \approx 1432.81$.
Area of Shaded region = $1432.81 - 1385.44 = 47.37$.

We can find the area of the decagon as $A = \frac{5}{2} a s = \frac{5}{2}(21) s$
We can approximate the area of the shaded region as $(10)(\text{area of one sail})$. Area of each sail is $\frac{1}{2}(s/2)(\text{length of perpendicular to the segment})= \frac{1}{2}(s/2)[21 \sec (\pi/10) - 21] = \frac{1}{4}s \times 21(\sec(\pi/10) - 1)$.
The perimeter of the polygon is $10s$.
Perimeter of the circumscribed decagon is $P = 10 \cdot 2 \cdot 21 \cdot \tan(18) = 420 \tan(18) = 136.46$, $s = 13.65$.
Area of one sail is close to the area of one square side of the circumscribed rectangle where the inscribed circle touches.
From the center, draw a line perpendicular to the tangent, length 21.
From one end of that tangent, draw a perpendicular line so we have a small square of length x. Then $tan(18) = x/21$ so $x = 21tan(18)$. So the area of this approximation of the surface area is $x^2 * 10$ and we have $Area_{Approximate} = 441 * 10 (tan(18))^2$. tan18 = 0.3249 so tan18^2 = 0.1056. Areaapprox is then close to 465.

A better calculation:
area of a regular polygon is n*R^2 sin(pi/n) cos(pi/n)
the regular polygon's area is 10*r^2*tan(pi/10). The radius here is 21
Then we get A = 10*(21)^2 *tan(pi/10)=1432.8. Circle area is 1385.4
So the area is about 1432.8-1385.4 = 47.3.
None of these match.

Area_decagon = 2.5*s*a = 2.5* 13.65* 21 ~ 716 Area of the decagon then is A=716 (NOT CORRECT)
