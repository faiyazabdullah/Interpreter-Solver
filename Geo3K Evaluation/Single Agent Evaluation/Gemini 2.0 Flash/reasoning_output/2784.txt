Let x be the length of segment CD. We are given that CE = 6 and AD = 9.
Since we are assuming that the segments that appear to be tangent are tangent, we can use the tangent-secant theorem.
The tangent-secant theorem states that if a tangent segment and a secant segment are drawn to a circle from an external point, then the square of the length of the tangent segment is equal to the product of the length of the secant segment and the length of the external segment of the secant segment.
In this case, CE is a tangent segment, and AD is a secant segment.
We are given that CE = 6, so the square of the length of the tangent segment is CE^2 = 6^2 = 36.
The secant segment is CD + AD = x + 9. The external segment of the secant segment is AD = 9.
By the tangent-secant theorem, we have CE^2 = AD(CD + AD), so
6^2 = x(x + AD).
The tangent-secant theorem does not apply to this situation because CE is not a secant.
Instead, consider the power of a point with respect to the circle. The power of point A is AE * AC = AD * AB, where B is the intersection of line AD with the circle.
If segment CE is tangent to the circle at E, then CE^2 = CD * CA. So 6^2 = x(x + 9).
36 = x(AD), where AD is the external segment of the secant from A to the circle.
Let's use the power of a point theorem. If CE is tangent to the circle at E, then CE^2 = CD * CA. However, we need to find CD = x.
From the problem, it looks like the secant is CD + DA = x + 9.
Using the tangent-secant power theorem, we have
CE^2 = CD * (CD + DA) is incorrect
CE^2 = CD(CD + CA) is incorrect
Instead, let DA * DC = CE^2
So, (9) * x = 6^2
9x = 36
x = 36/9
x = 4

However, there is no answer choice 4. We need to clarify what is tangent and what is not. Assuming AE and CE are tangent, then by the tangent secant theorem,
CD * CA = CE^2
We have CE = 6, and AC = AD + DC = 9+x.
So 6^2 = CE^2 = x(x+9)
We must have DA * DC = CE^2. Given CE = 6, so we have
(x) * 9 = (6)^2 = 36.
DC * (DC + AD) = CA*CD is incorrect. We need to use the tangent/secant theorem: DA * (DA + AC)

However, this contradicts the statement that DA = 9.
Applying secant-tangent theorem to exterior point C gives:
CD * CA = CE^2
x*(x + 9) = 6^2
x^2+ 9x = 36
x^2+9x - 36 = 0
(x+12)(x-3) = 0
So x = -12 or x = 3.
Since length can't be negative, x =3.
None of the answer choices are equal to 3. So there must be a tangent segment we are not considering.

Given CE = 6. Let the segment AD be labeled as 9. Assume segments are tangent, then DC * DA = AC * AE
I think the correct theorem to use is: CD * (CA + AD) = 6^2 = 36
x * (x + DA) = CE^2
AD could equal DE
If CD * CA = CE^2 where CE is tangent to the circle
We are given CE = 6, so 6^2 = 36 = CD * AC. Let CE be tangent to the circle, and CA intersect the circle at a single point. Then assume CA is some unknown constant.
However, we don't know CE.

We have CE^2 = x * (9)
6^2 = 9*x
36 = 9*x
x = 4. The answer is incorrect
Let C, D, E be distinct locations on the circumference of a circle. Then draw tangents from the point x.
