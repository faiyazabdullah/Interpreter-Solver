QUESTION:
In the figure, m \angle 9 = 75. Find the measure of \angle 6.

CHOICES:
A. 75
B. 85
C. 95
D. 105

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
We are given that m \angle 9 = 75.
We want to find the measure of \angle 6.
From the figure, lines l, m, and n are parallel. Line t is a transversal.
Angles 6 and 9 are consecutive interior angles.
Since lines m and n are parallel, angles 6 and 9 are supplementary.
Thus, m \angle 6 + m \angle 9 = 180.
Substituting m \angle 9 = 75, we have m \angle 6 + 75 = 180.
Subtracting 75 from both sides, we get m \angle 6 = 180 - 75 = 105.
Therefore, the measure of \angle 6 is 105.
