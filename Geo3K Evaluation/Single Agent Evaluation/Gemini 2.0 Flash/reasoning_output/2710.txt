Since WXYZ is a rectangle, we know that angle WXY is a right angle, so m∠WXY = 90°.
We are given that m∠1 = 30°.
∠1 and ∠2 are complementary angles because their sum is 90°.
Therefore, m∠2 = 90° - m∠1 = 90° - 30° = 60°.
In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal in length and bisect each other. Therefore, the triangle AXW is an isosceles triangle with AW = AX.
This means that the angles opposite these sides are equal, so ∠AWX = ∠AXW.
The measure of ∠AXW is equal to the measure of ∠1, which is 30°.
Therefore, m∠AWX = 30°.
The sum of the angles in triangle AXW is 180°, so m∠WAX + m∠AWX + m∠AXW = 180°.
m∠WAX + 30° + 30° = 180°
m∠WAX + 60° = 180°
m∠WAX = 120°
Since WXYZ is a rectangle, angle YWX is 90°.
The sum of angle ∠7 and angle ∠8 is 90°.
Since the diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other, the intersection point A is equidistant from W, X, Y, and Z. This means that triangle AYX is an isosceles triangle, so AY = AX. Also, triangle AZY is an isosceles triangle with AZ = AY. And triangle AZX is isosceles with AX = AZ.
In rectangle WXYZ, sides WY and ZX are equal. Since the diagonals bisect each other, WA = AX = AY = AZ.
In triangle AYW, AY = AW. So angle ∠6 = ∠8.
Since angle Y = 90, then angle ∠5 + ∠6 = 90.
Angle ∠2 is 60 degrees, then angle ∠4 is 60 degrees.
Since the diagonal WY bisects the rectangle, then triangles WXY and ZYX are congruent.
Also, triangles WXA and ZYA are congruent.
Triangle AYX is isosceles and AY = AX. Therefore, angle ∠5 is equal to angle ∠1.
m∠5 = 30°
