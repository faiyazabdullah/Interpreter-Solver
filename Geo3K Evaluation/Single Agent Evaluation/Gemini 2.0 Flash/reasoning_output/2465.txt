Since lines l, m, and n are perpendicular bisectors of triangle PQR, T is the circumcenter of triangle PQR. Therefore, T is equidistant from the vertices P, Q, and R. Thus, TP = TQ = TR.
We are given TQ = 2x, PT = 3y - 1, and TR = 8.
So, 2x = 8 and 3y - 1 = 8.

From 3y - 1 = 8, we have 3y = 9, which gives y = 3.
From 2x = 8, we have x = 4.
We are also given that PR = z + 4, and that the segment from D to R has length 7. Since GD is the perpendicular bisector of PR, then D is the midpoint of PR. Therefore, PD = DR = 7. Thus, PR = PD + DR = 7 + 7 = 14.
We are given PR = z + 4. So, z + 4 = 14.
Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get z = 14 - 4 = 10.
However, this does not match any of the options.

From the diagram, it can be seen that the segment of length 7 goes from D to R. Since D is the foot of the perpendicular bisector, D is the midpoint of PR, and thus DR = PD. Therefore PR = 2*7 = 14.
Then we have PR = z+4 = 14, so z = 10.
The diagram has lengths PR = z+4 and DR = 7. Since D is the foot of the perpendicular bisector from T to PR, DR = PD and D is the midpoint of PR. Thus, PR = PD + DR = 7 + 7 = 14. Then z+4 = 14, so z = 14-4 = 10. This is not in the answer choices, let's re-evaluate.
There must be an error.
We have TQ = 2x, TP = 3y-1, TR = 8.
Thus TP = TQ = TR. Thus TQ = TR = 8, so 2x = 8, so x=4.
Also, TP = TR = 8, so 3y-1 = 8, 3y = 9, y=3.

We are given PR = z+4, and DR = 7. As before, since D is the foot of the perpendicular bisector TD from T to PR, DR = PD. Thus PR = 2*DR = 2*7 = 14.
Thus PR = z+4 = 14, so z = 10.
Still no matching answer. Let's look at answer choices, maybe there is a typo.

If z=3, PR = 3+4 = 7. Then DR = 7, but PR = 2DR, so 7 = 14, contradiction.
If z=4, PR = 4+4 = 8. Then DR = 7, but PR = 2DR, so 8 = 14, contradiction.
If z=5, PR = 5+4 = 9. Then DR = 7, but PR = 2DR, so 9 = 14, contradiction.
If z=6, PR = 6+4 = 10. Then DR = 7, but PR = 2DR, so 10 = 14, contradiction.
DR must be 7, and PR = z+4. But we found PR = 14, so z+4 = 14.
Still no match. Let's see where the number 7 refers to in the diagram. It starts at point D and goes to point R, and we are given that D is the midpoint of PR, hence DR = 7. Since DR = 7, it follows that PR = 14. Since PR = z+4, it follows that z+4=14, and hence z=10.

If we make an error, then we have DR = 7 and DR = z+4, hence z+4=7, so z=3. Then PR = z+4 = 7. So 2*7=7, contradiction. I think we must have something messed up.
Still, since we require an answer, we pick the "closest" value. In this case, z = 10, and closest choice would be D.

Final Answer: D
