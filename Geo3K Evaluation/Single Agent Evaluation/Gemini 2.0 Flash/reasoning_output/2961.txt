QUESTION:
Find J L.

CHOICES:
A. 7
B. 11
C. 12
D. 14

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The given figure is a triangle JKL. The sides JK and KL are congruent, since they have the same marking. Thus, triangle JKL is an isosceles triangle.
Given:
JK = 7x
KL = 11x - 8
JL = x + 12

Since JK = KL, we can write the equation:
7x = 11x - 8
Subtract 7x from both sides:
0 = 4x - 8
Add 8 to both sides:
8 = 4x
Divide both sides by 4:
x = 2

Now we need to find the length of JL:
JL = x + 12
Substitute x = 2 into the equation:
JL = 2 + 12
JL = 14

The length of JL is 14.
Comparing the result with the given answer choices:
A. 7
B. 11
C. 12
D. 14

The correct answer is 14, which is choice D.

Final Answer: D
