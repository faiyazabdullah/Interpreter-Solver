Since WXYZ is a rectangle, angle WXY is a right angle. Therefore, m∠2 = 90 degrees.
Also, the diagonals of a rectangle are equal and bisect each other.
Thus, WX = ZY, WY = XZ, WA = AZ = AX = AY, where A is the intersection point of the diagonals.
This means that triangle WAX is an isosceles triangle with WA = AX.
Therefore, m∠1 = m∠7 = 30 degrees.
Since ∠WXY is a right angle, we have m∠1 + m∠2 = 90.
So, 30 + m∠2 = 90. This means that m∠2 = 90 - 30 = 60.
Since WXYZ is a rectangle, ∠XYZ is a right angle. Thus m∠XYZ = 90.
Also, m∠3 = m∠1 = 30 because triangle AZX is isosceles.
Therefore, m∠4 = m∠8.
In rectangle WXYZ, m∠WZY = 90 degrees. Thus m∠3 + m∠4 = 90.
So, 30 + m∠4 = 90, which gives m∠4 = 60.
m∠5 + m∠6 = 90 since ∠WYZ is a right angle.
In triangle AYZ, m∠AYZ = m∠AZY = m∠4 = 60. Therefore, triangle AYZ is an equilateral triangle. But this isn't necessarily true.
The diagonals of a rectangle are equal and bisect each other.
Therefore, triangle YXA is isosceles since YA = XA. So, m∠5 = m∠1 = 30.
Since m∠XYZ = 90, m∠5 + m∠6 = 90.
So 30 + m∠6 = 90. This means m∠6 = 90 - 30 = 60.
