GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
In the given trapezoid, the midsegment is the segment connecting the midpoints of the non-parallel sides. The length of the midsegment is equal to the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides.
In this case, the parallel sides have lengths 6x + 4 and 10x - 2, and the midsegment has length 5x + 10.
Therefore, we have the equation:
5x + 10 = (6x + 4 + 10x - 2) / 2
Multiply both sides by 2:
2(5x + 10) = 6x + 4 + 10x - 2
10x + 20 = 16x + 2
Subtract 10x from both sides:
20 = 6x + 2
Subtract 2 from both sides:
18 = 6x
Divide both sides by 6:
x = 3
