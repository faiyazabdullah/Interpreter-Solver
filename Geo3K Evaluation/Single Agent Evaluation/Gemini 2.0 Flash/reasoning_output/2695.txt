Let the circle be denoted by $\omega$. Let $O$ be the center of $\omega$.
Since $ML$ is tangent to $\omega$ at $L$, $\angle MLN = 36^\circ$, and $\angle LNP = 78^\circ$.
In triangle $MNL$, we have $\angle MLN = 36^\circ$ and $\angle LNM = 78^\circ$.
The sum of angles in triangle $MNL$ is $180^\circ$.
Thus, $\angle NLM = 180^\circ - (\angle MLN + \angle LNM) = 180^\circ - (36^\circ + 78^\circ) = 180^\circ - 114^\circ = 66^\circ$.
The angle between the tangent $ML$ and chord $NL$ is $\angle MLN = 36^\circ$. By the tangent-chord theorem, $\angle NLP = \angle MLN = 36^\circ$. This means that $\angle NLP$ is the inscribed angle that intercepts $\widehat{LP}$. The measure of $\widehat{LP}$ is twice the measure of the inscribed angle $\angle NLP$. Therefore, the measure of arc $LP$ is $2\times 36^\circ = 72^\circ$.

Also, $\angle N = 78^\circ$. Then $\angle NLP$ intercepts arc $LP$. By the inscribed angle theorem, $\angle NLP = \frac{1}{2} m\widehat{LP}$. Since $\angle MLN = 36^{\circ}$ and $\angle LNP = 78^{\circ}$, $\angle MLN + \angle NLP = \angle MNP$. We know that $\angle NLP = \frac{1}{2} m\widehat{LP}$, then $78^{\circ} = \frac{1}{2} m\widehat{LP}$. We also have that $\angle MNP + \angle NML + \angle NLP = 180^\circ$, therefore $78 + 36 = 114$.

Then we have $\angle NLM = 180 - (36+78) = 180 - 114 = 66^\circ$.
Let us look at the exterior angle $\angle LNM = 78^{\circ}$, which is the exterior angle of triangle $MNL$.
The exterior angle theorem states that $\angle LNM = \angle NML + \angle NL M$. Thus, $78^\circ = 36^\circ + \angle NLM$. Hence, $\angle NLM = 78^\circ - 36^\circ = 42^\circ$.
However, since $ML$ is tangent to the circle at $L$, $NL$ is a secant. Then by the tangent-chord theorem, $\angle MLN = 36^{\circ}$ and $\angle NLP = \frac{1}{2} m \widehat{LP}$.
Then, $\frac{1}{2} m \widehat{LP} = 36^{\circ}$, so $m \widehat{LP} = 2 \times 36^{\circ} = 72^{\circ}$.
Since the angle $\angle MNP$ intercept arc $\widehat{LP}$, we have $\frac{m \widehat{LP}}{2} = \angle MNP$.

By considering $\angle LNP = 78^{\circ}$ and that it is an exterior angle of a triangle, we cannot deduce anything about $m \widehat{LP}$ directly.
We are given that $\angle MLN = 36^\circ$, which means $\angle NLP$ formed by chord $NL$ and the tangent $ML$ is $36^\circ$. This means that the intercepted arc $LP$ has a measure $2 \times 36 = 72^\circ$.
We have to find $m \widehat{LP}$. We know $\angle NLP$ intercepts $\widehat{LP}$, and by the inscribed angle theorem, $m \widehat{LP} = 2 \angle NLP$. We also know that $\angle NLP$ and $\angle MLN$ are supplementary because $ML$ is a tangent at $L$. Then $m\widehat{LP}=72$

In the triangle $MNL$, $\angle NLM = 180 - (36+78) = 66^\circ$.
Since $NL$ is a secant and $ML$ is tangent to the circle at $L$, $\angle MLN = 36^{\circ}$ implies that $\frac{\text{arc LP}}{2} = 36^{\circ}$. Then arc LP = $72^{\circ}$.
The inscribed angle $\angle NLP$ intercepts $\widehat{LP}$. So, $m\widehat{LP}=2\angle MLN = 2 \cdot 36 = 72$.

Since the exterior angle is 78 degrees and the exterior angle is an inscribed angle, the intercepted arc is 2 times the measure of the exterior angle. $2 * 78=156$, but since tangent, $\widehat{LP} = 2 * 36= 72$

The sum of the angles of triangle $MLN$ = $180$. Then $\angle NLM = 180 - (78+36) = 180 - 114 = 66$.

However, we know that the angle between tangent and chord is equal to half the arc measure it bounds. Thus $m\widehat{NL}$ arc equals to $(2*66) = 132$. Also for the the angle between chord and tangent, it is given that $= 36 = \frac {LP}{2}$. $m\widehat{LP} = 72$. But we know the the arc measure should equal $(2 *78) = 156$. Thus the answer is D
