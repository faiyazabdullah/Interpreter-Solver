From the diagram, we have TD is perpendicular to AC and TB is perpendicular to AN. Also, TM = BM. Therefore, triangle TMB is an isosceles triangle. So angle TBM = angle BTM = 28 degrees.
Since TB is perpendicular to AB, we have angle TBA = 90 degrees.
Then angle MBA = angle TBA - angle TBM = 90 - 28 = 62 degrees.
In triangle MBA, TM = BM, so triangle TBM is an isosceles triangle, so angle BTM = angle TBM = 28.
Consider quadrilateral ATBN, angle BTA = 28 degrees, angle BNA = 90 degrees.
Since AC is a chord, and TD is perpendicular to AC, D is the midpoint of AC, so AD = CD.
Also, BM = TM. The question asks for angle CAM. Angle CAM is the same as angle CAD. Since AD = CD, and TD is perpendicular to AC, AT = CT.
Also, angle ATC = 2 * angle ABC.
Let's consider right triangle TDB. TB is given as perpendicular to AB. Therefore AB is a tangent to the circle at B.
We are given angle ATB = 28 degrees. In triangle TBM, TM = BM, so angle TBM = angle BTM = 28 degrees.
Since TB is perpendicular to AB, we have angle ABT = 90.
So angle MBA = angle TBA - angle TBM = 90 - 28 = 62 degrees. Since TM = BM, M is the midpoint of BT.
Since TD is perpendicular to AC, and AD = CD, angle TAD = angle TCD.
Angle ATB = 28 degrees.
Angle CAM = angle CTM = angle BTM = 28 degrees.
Therefore, angle CAM = 28 degrees.
