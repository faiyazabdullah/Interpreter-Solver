The figure is a regular octagon with the distance from the center to a vertex being 6 cm. This distance is the radius of the circumscribed circle.
To find the area of the octagon, we can divide it into 8 congruent isosceles triangles, each with a vertex at the center of the octagon. The angle at the center of the octagon for each triangle is 360/8 = 45 degrees.
The two sides of each isosceles triangle are equal to the radius of the circumscribed circle, which is 6 cm. The area of each triangle can be calculated using the formula: (1/2) * a * b * sin(C), where a and b are the sides and C is the angle between them.
In this case, the area of each triangle is (1/2) * 6 * 6 * sin(45) = 18 * sin(45) = 18 * (sqrt(2)/2) = 9 * sqrt(2) square centimeters.
Since there are 8 triangles, the area of the octagon is 8 * 9 * sqrt(2) = 72 * sqrt(2) square centimeters.
sqrt(2) is approximately 1.414, so the area is approximately 72 * 1.414 = 101.808 square centimeters.
Rounding to the nearest tenth, the area is 101.8 square centimeters.
