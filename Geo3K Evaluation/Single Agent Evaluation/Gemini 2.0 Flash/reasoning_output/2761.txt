From the given information, we can observe that the two triangles are similar by the Angle-Angle (AA) similarity postulate. This is because the angles at vertices A and C in the first triangle are congruent to the corresponding angles in the second triangle. Also, the ratio of the corresponding sides must be equal.
Therefore, we have the similarity between the triangles. Let's write out the similarity statement, noting that the angles at A and C are corresponding:
Triangle ABX ~ Triangle X (right) 6 where "right" corresponds to angle A
Triangle CBX ~ Triangle X (left) 6 where "left" corresponds to angle C
Based on the similarity of the two triangles, the corresponding sides are proportional. Thus,
3x / 6 = 8 / x
Multiplying both sides by 6x, we get:
3x^2 = 48
x^2 = 16
x = 4 (since side lengths must be positive)
