The sum of angles in a quadrilateral is 360 degrees. Therefore, in quadrilateral ABDE, we have:

∠B + ∠D + ∠A + ∠E = 360°

(3x - 15)° + 68° + 2x° + ∠E = 360°

Since AE is a straight line, angles around A sum to 180°. The angles next to 2x° is (180 - 2x)°. Angle A is equal to 2x°

Since angles about a point sum up to 360, we know that the angles inside the quadrilateral add to 360.
We are given two angles, namely 68 and 3x-15 and 2x
We want to relate the angle outside AE and use it to find the angle near point E

We can use the property that the exterior angle of a triangle equals the sum of the two non-adjacent angles.
Let's say that 2x° is an exterior angle to the triangle BEC. Therefore 2x = (3x - 15) + y^2 where y^2 =∠C

Since the angles in triangle ADC add up to 180, 68 + 2x + y^2 = 180
2x + y^2 = 180 - 68
2x + y^2 = 112
y^2 = 112 - 2x

Also, since angles on line AE add to 180,  2x + ∠BEA = 180 where ∠BEA = 180 - 2x

We can then plug the angles in quadrilateral ABDE into the formula for the sum of the angles of the quadrilateral equals 360

Angles in ABDE are 68, 3x-15, 2x, 180 - 2x
Adding these angles = 360
68 + 3x - 15 + 2x + 180 - 2x = 360
3x + 233 = 360
3x = 127
x = 127/3
x = 42.33 which is not in the options

Looking at the figure again, if we consider angle BAC = 2x, then angle EAC = 180 - 2x
Angles in triangle EBC add up to 180.
So (3x - 15) + (180 - 2x) + y^2 = 180
x - 15 + y^2 = 0
x + y^2 = 15
From above, 2x + y^2 = 112
Subtract x+y^2=15 from 2x+y^2=112
x = 97

I believe the problem should state that AE is parallel to BD

If AE is parallel to BD, then ∠DAE + ∠ADB = 180, so 68 + 2x = 180
Then 2x = 112, x = 56.
But we need to show the choices
I am not sure.

Let's solve assuming line AE is parallel to DB.
∠DAE and ∠ADB add up to 180 because they are consecutive interior angles.  Therefore 68 + 2x = 180 and then 2x = 112 so x = 56. But this is not an option either.

The sum of the angles in triangle ABC is 180.
Therefore (3x-15) + 2x + y^2 = 180
So 5x - 15 + y^2 = 180

In triangle ADC, the sum of the angles equals 180
Therefore 68 + 2x + y^2 = 180
2x + y^2 = 112
so y^2 = 112 - 2x

Then 5x - 15 + 112 - 2x = 180
3x + 97 = 180
3x = 83
x = 83/3 = 27.66

Perhaps there is an error in copying the problem, but based on this problem and figure, if we assume there is no typing errors, I would choose A since it is nearest to x = 27.66
