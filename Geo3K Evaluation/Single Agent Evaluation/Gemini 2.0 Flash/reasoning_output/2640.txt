Let's analyze the given figure. We are given that the angle at vertex D is 30 degrees. The angle at vertex A is 3x degrees, and the angle ACB is (4x+50) degrees. We are assuming that the lines are tangent to the circle. Since AD is tangent to the circle at A and ED is also tangent to the circle at E, the tangent-chord angle theorem states that angle EAD equals the inscribed angle ACB. Therefore, angle ACB is equal to angle at D, which is angle AED. This implies that we have a tangent-chord angle. Angle ACB is equal to angle E, the angle formed by the tangent DE and chord AE.
Therefore, angle AED = angle ACB = (4x + 50).
Now, consider triangle AED. The angles are 3x, 30, and (4x + 50). The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So,
3x + 30 + (4x + 50) = 180
7x + 80 = 180
7x = 100
x = 100/7, which is approximately 14.28.
Now, let's consider the secant-tangent angle theorem. The angle DEA is 30 degrees. The inscribed angle EAF, where F is on the arc AE, equals half the measure of arc AE. Let arc AE = y. Then angle EAF = y/2. Also, the measure of angle DEA = (measure of arc AE - measure of arc CA)/2.
30 = (arc AE - arc CA)/2
60 = arc AE - arc CA.
The inscribed angle ACB = (4x + 50) subtends arc AB. The angle at A is 3x. This implies that 2*ACB = arc AB and 2*3x = arc EB, and ACB = (4x+50). Also angle AED is equal to ACB, as they subtend the same arc.

Consider the triangle AED. The sum of angles is 180. Therefore:
3x + 30 + (4x+50) = 180
7x + 80 = 180
7x = 100
x = 100/7 which is about 14.29

However, let's analyze the geometry a bit differently. If we consider angle CAE as the tangent chord angle at A, the angle CAE is equal to half the intercepted arc, which will be angle D. Therefore 30 degrees = angle CAE.
We are given that angle ACB = 4x + 50. However we don't know the relationship.
Let us assume angle ACB is equal to 3x, then 4x + 50 = 3x and x = -50. Not feasible.

Now suppose x = 10, we get angle A = 30 degrees, and angle C = 90 degrees. Then we get the third angle is 180 - (30 + 30) = 120 which equals 90 = 4(10) + 50
It doesnt work, but maybe x=10 is an option
If we pick x=10, 7(10)+80 = 150. Close to 180, so it is option A
