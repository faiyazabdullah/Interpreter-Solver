The image shows a quadrilateral $ABCD$. The diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at point $E$. We are given that $AD = AB$ and $CD = BC$, so the quadrilateral $ABCD$ is a kite. Also, we are given that $AE \perp BD$. We are given that $DE = 5$ and $BE = 12$. We need to find the length of $BC$.
Since $ABCD$ is a kite and $AD = AB$ and $CD = BC$, the diagonal $AC$ is the perpendicular bisector of $BD$. Thus, $\triangle ADE$ is a right triangle with $DE = 5$, and $\triangle ABE$ is a right triangle with $BE = 12$. Also, $AE \perp BD$. Since $AD = AB$, we have $AD^2 = AE^2 + DE^2$ and $AB^2 = AE^2 + BE^2$. Thus, $AE^2 + DE^2 = AE^2 + BE^2$, which implies $DE^2 = BE^2$, but this is not true since $DE=5$ and $BE=12$. However, it is given that $AD=AB$ and $CD=BC$. Also, $AE \perp BD$.
Since $ABCD$ is a kite, $AC$ is the perpendicular bisector of $BD$. Therefore, $\triangle CDE$ is a right triangle with $DE=5$. $\triangle CBE$ is a right triangle with $BE=12$. Since $CD = BC$, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find $CD$ and $BC$. In $\triangle CDE$, we have $CD^2 = DE^2 + CE^2$, so $CD^2 = 5^2 + CE^2 = 25 + CE^2$. In $\triangle CBE$, we have $BC^2 = BE^2 + CE^2$, so $BC^2 = 12^2 + CE^2 = 144 + CE^2$. Since $BC = CD$, we have $BC^2 = CD^2$, so $144 + CE^2 = 25 + CE^2$.
But this implies $144 = 25$, which is not true.
However, in the figure, we are given $BC = CD$, so $ABCD$ is a kite. $BD \perp AC$, so $\triangle BCE$ is a right triangle. Using the Pythagorean Theorem, we have $BC^2 = BE^2 + CE^2$. We are given that $BE = 12$. We need to find $CE$.
Since $CD = BC$, we have $CD^2 = CE^2 + DE^2$, where $DE = 5$. So, $BC^2 = CE^2 + 5^2$.
Thus, $BE^2 + CE^2 = CE^2 + DE^2$, but $BE=12$ and $DE=5$, which means that $12^2+CE^2=CD^2$ and $CD^2=5^2+CE^2$.
Since $BE=12$, $CE^2 = BC^2-BE^2$, so $CE^2 = BC^2 - 12^2$. Since $CD=BC$, $CD^2=CE^2+DE^2$, so $BC^2 = CE^2+5^2$. Then $BC^2 - 144 = BC^2 - 25$. So $BC=13$ is incorrect.

Since $CD = BC$ and $BE = 12$ and $DE = 5$, $\triangle BCE$ and $\triangle CDE$ are right triangles. Let $CE = x$.
Then $BC^2 = 12^2 + x^2 = 144 + x^2$ and $CD^2 = 5^2 + x^2 = 25 + x^2$.
Since $BC = CD$, $BC^2 = CD^2$, so $144 + x^2 = 25 + x^2$, which is not possible unless the length 12 and 5 are switched or they are both incorrect.

Assuming BC is $13$, $13^2 = 169 = 144 + x^2$. $x^2 = 25$, so $x=5$.
Now consider $CD = 13$, then $13^2 = 169 = 25 + x^2$, then $x^2 = 144$ so $x=12$.
The problem statement must be flawed. The only possible way to solve is if we assume they are similar triangles and ratios can be used.

But given that BE=12, the question asks for BC. If we don't know the value for CD, and AD=AB and CD=BC, then C is most likely the closest match from the given values in the diagram.
