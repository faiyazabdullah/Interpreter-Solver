The pentagon PQRST is equilateral and inscribed in circle U. Since the pentagon is equilateral and inscribed in a circle, it is also regular. The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is (5-2)*180 = 3*180 = 540 degrees. Since the pentagon is regular, each interior angle is 540/5 = 108 degrees. We want to find the measure of angle PSR. Since the pentagon is regular, angle PSR is an interior angle, so angle PSR = 108 degrees. However, angle PSR is not explicitly shown. We want to find the measure of angle PSR. Since PQRST is a regular pentagon, all its sides are equal, and all its interior angles are equal. Each interior angle of a regular pentagon measures (5-2)*180/5 = 3*180/5 = 540/5 = 108 degrees. Therefore, angle P = angle Q = angle R = angle S = angle T = 108 degrees. Now consider triangle PST. Since PS = ST, triangle PST is an isosceles triangle. Angle PST is an interior angle of the pentagon, so angle PST = 108 degrees. Therefore, angle TPS = angle TSP = (180 - 108)/2 = 72/2 = 36 degrees. Also, consider triangle QRS. Since QR = RS, triangle QRS is an isosceles triangle. Angle QRS is an interior angle of the pentagon, so angle QRS = 108 degrees. Therefore, angle RQS = angle RSQ = (180 - 108)/2 = 72/2 = 36 degrees. Angle PSR = angle PST + angle TSR.
We know m \angle PST + m \angle QRS = 108 degrees.
Since PQRST is a regular pentagon, each interior angle is 108 degrees. Also, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. The arc PR subtends angle PSR.
Arc PR consists of 3 sides of the pentagon, so the measure of arc PR is 3/5 of the total circumference, which is 3/5 * 360 = 3*72 = 216 degrees.
Then m \angle PSR = 1/2 * m arc PQR = 1/2 (3 * 72) = 1/2 * (216) = 108.  Each side covers 360/5 = 72 degrees.  P to R would be 3 * 72 = 144 degrees. Central angle PUR is 144, so arc PR is 144*2 = 288.
The remaining arc goes into mPSR: PQR covers three sides. So the intercepted arc PR consists of three arcs. So PR spans 3 sides. Each side has a central angle of 360/5 = 72.  Then, 3x72 = 216.
So the inscribed angle PSR is half this or 216/2 = 108.
m \angle PSR would measure 3 sides of length 72 degrees *1/2=108 or 3x72/2 = 216/2 = 108.

Since PSR is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc PQR, the measure of arc PQR is 3*(360/5) = 3*72 = 216 degrees. Therefore, the measure of angle PSR is 216/2 = 108 degrees.

However, none of the options is 108.
m angle PSR = (360-72)/2 = 144.  However, the given answer is 108.
The central angle subtended by each side is 360/5 = 72. The inscribed angle facing three sides will be equal to three sides or 3x72=216. One half if that angle gives us 108.

m \angle PSR = (3/5)*180*(5-2)/5 / 2 = 108 so nothing works.
