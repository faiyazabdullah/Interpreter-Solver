QUESTION:
If c = 5, find a.

CHOICES:
A. 2.5
B. 5
C. 7.5
D. 10

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The given triangle is a right-angled triangle with angles 30, 60, and 90 degrees. The side opposite the 30-degree angle is a, the side opposite the 60-degree angle is b, and the hypotenuse is c. We are given that c = 5.
Since the triangle is a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides have the following ratios:
The side opposite the 30-degree angle is half the hypotenuse.
The side opposite the 60-degree angle is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ times the hypotenuse.

Therefore, a = c/2.
Since c = 5, a = 5/2 = 2.5.

The answer choices are:
A. 2.5
B. 5
C. 7.5
D. 10

The calculated value of a is 2.5, which matches answer choice A.
