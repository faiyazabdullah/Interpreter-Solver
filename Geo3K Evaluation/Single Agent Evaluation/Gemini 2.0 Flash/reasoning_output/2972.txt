From the image, we can see that Y, V, and T are midpoints of the sides S Z, U Z, and S U, respectively. Therefore, S Y = Y Z, U V = V Z, and S T = T U. We are also given that U J = 9 and V J = 3.
Since the medians of a triangle intersect at a point that divides each median in a 2:1 ratio, we have U J / V J = 9 / 3 = 3. However, the ratio should be 2:1, so we have to be careful.
Let S J = x. We also know Z T = 18. Since T is the midpoint of S U and V is the midpoint of Z U, T V is parallel to S Z and T V = (1/2) S Z. Also, since Y is the midpoint of S Z, we have S Z = 2 S Y.
Since the medians intersect at J, we have S J / Y J = 2 / 1, so Y J = x / 2.
Also, U J / V J = 2 / 1 = 9 / 3 = 3, so this relationship holds true.
Let Z J = y. Then Z J / T J = 2 / 1, so T J = y / 2.
Since Z T = Z J + T J = y + y / 2 = 18, we have (3 / 2) y = 18, so y = 12.
Therefore, Z J = 12.
We are also given V J = 3. Since U J / V J = 2 / 1, we can verify that U J = 2 * 3 = 6. However, it is given that U J = 9. This indicates that the length UJ/VJ is not 2.
The medians of the triangle are S V, Z T, and U Y. Since medians are lines from the vertex to the midpoints of the opposite sides, the intersection point J divides each median into a 2:1 ratio. Hence, S J/ J V = 2/1, Z J/ J T = 2/1, and U J/ J Y = 2/1.
We are given U J = 9 and V J = 3. So, it should be S J/ J V = 2. Hence S J is twice the length of JV. Thus SJ = 2JV, ZJ=2JT, UJ=2JY
Using ZT = 18, we also have Z J + T J = 18. Z J / T J = 2 / 1, so Z J = 2 T J.
2 T J + T J = 18, which gives 3 T J = 18. Therefore, T J = 6, and Z J = 12.
Now consider S V. We know that V J = 3. Let S J = x. Then S J / V J = 2 / 1, so x / 3 = 2, which implies x = 6.
So, S J = 6.
