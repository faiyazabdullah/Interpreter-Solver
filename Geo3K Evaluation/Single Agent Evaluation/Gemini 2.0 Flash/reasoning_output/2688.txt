QUESTION:
Find the value of t in the parallelogram.

CHOICES:
A. 6
B. 7
C. 8
D. 13

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
In a parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other. Therefore, the segments created by the intersection of the diagonals are equal. In the given figure, we have:
WB = BZ
XB = BY

From the image, we know that WB = 8 and BY = 6. Therefore, BZ = 8 and XB = 6. We are also given that BZ = 2t - 6 and XB = s - 7. Thus, we can set up the equations:
2t - 6 = 8
s - 7 = 6

We need to find the value of t. Let's solve the equation 2t - 6 = 8:
2t - 6 = 8
2t = 8 + 6
2t = 14
t = 14 / 2
t = 7

Now let's find the value of s:
s - 7 = 6
s = 6 + 7
s = 13

The question asks us to find the value of t. We have calculated that t = 7.

Comparing this value with the answer choices, we find that it matches answer choice B.
