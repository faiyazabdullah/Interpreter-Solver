In \triangle CDF, K is the centroid.
We are given that DK = 16.
We need to find the length of CD.
Since K is the centroid, the medians of the triangle intersect at K. Let G be the midpoint of CD.
Then FG is a median of \triangle CDF and K lies on FG.
We know that the centroid divides the median in a 2:1 ratio.
So, FK : KG = 2 : 1 and CK : KG = 2:1.
Similarly, if J is the midpoint of DF, then CJ is a median, and CK : KJ = 2 : 1.
Also, if H is the midpoint of CF, then DH is a median, and DK : KH = 2 : 1.
Since DK = 16, we have DK = (2/3) DH.  Also DH = DK + KH, so DH = 16 + KH.
Then 16 = (2/3) DH, so DH = (3/2)*16 = 24.
Since DK : KH = 2 : 1, we have 16 : KH = 2 : 1. Thus KH = 16/2 = 8.
Also, since K is the centroid, we have DK = (2/3) * DM, where M is the midpoint of CF. In our diagram, we have DK = (2/3)*DH. So DH = (3/2)*DK = (3/2)*16 = 24. Then KH = DH - DK = 24-16=8.
We also know that CG is a median. Therefore, DK = 2KG and CK = 2KG.  Also CG is a median so CG and DG are equal. 
Since DG=GC, G is the midpoint of CD.
If G is the midpoint of CD, then DG = GC, and CD = 2DG = 2GC.
We are given that DK = 16.
Since K is the centroid, DK = (2/3) * median to CF.
Since CD = 9 in the diagram, CG = 9/2 = 4.5, DG = 4.5.
However, the median that passes through K to CF is DH, so DK = (2/3) DH, so 16 = (2/3)DH, so DH = 24.

But we are given DK = 16. Also K is the centroid of \triangle CDF.
Let G be the midpoint of CD. Then FG is a median of \triangle CDF.
Then FK/GK = 2, so FK = 2GK.
Similarly, DK : KG = 2 : 1. So 16/KG = 2, which implies KG = 8.
Also, CK : KG = 2 : 1, so CK = 2KG = 2(8) = 16.
Since K is the centroid, DK = (2/3)*median from D to CF.
Also CK = (2/3)*median from C to DF.
Since DK = 16, DK : KG = 2 : 1. Then KG = DK/2 = 16/2 = 8.
Then DG = DK + KG = 16+8 = 24.
Since G is the midpoint of CD, CD = 2DG = 2(24) = 48. However, that is not one of the choices.

It is given that the median from C goes to DF and the median from D goes to CF.  So CD = 9 is not consistent.
Let G be the midpoint of CD.
Then CG = DG. Then CD = 2CG = 2DG.
We have DK : KG = 2 : 1, where KG is the segment from K to G.
Then DK = 16, so KG = 8.
We know that length DG is a segment of length equal to 9 in the picture.
However, DK is 16, which is > 9. 

If DG is a median and G is the midpoint of CF and CD = 9, then G must lie on CD. 
Also the length of the median from D to CF is greater than CD, so K must lie near the intersection and on the segment DG such that DK = 16. Since the length CD = 9, something is not right.  The ratio of DG = DK+KG means 9 = 16 + KG. But KG cannot be negative.
If CG = 9, then CD is twice that value. Then CD=18.
