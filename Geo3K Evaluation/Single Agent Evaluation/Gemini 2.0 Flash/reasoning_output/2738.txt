GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
In the right triangle shown, we are asked to find the ratio of $\tan L$.
We are given the lengths of the sides of the right triangle $JKL$.
The side opposite angle $L$ is $JK$, which has a length of 5.
The side adjacent to angle $L$ is $LK$, which has a length of 12.
Therefore, $\tan L = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{JK}{LK} = \frac{5}{12}$.

To express this as a decimal to the nearest hundredth, we divide 5 by 12:
$\frac{5}{12} \approx 0.41666...$
Rounding to the nearest hundredth, we get 0.42.
