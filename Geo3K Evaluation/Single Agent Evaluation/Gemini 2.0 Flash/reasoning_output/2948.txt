We are given a figure with AD perpendicular to BC, and AB perpendicular to AC. We are given that AB = 10 and BD = 5. We need to find BC.
Since AD is perpendicular to BC, triangle ABD is a right triangle.
By the Pythagorean theorem, we have $AB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2$.
Substituting the given values, we have $10^2 = AD^2 + 5^2$, so $100 = AD^2 + 25$.
Therefore, $AD^2 = 100 - 25 = 75$, and $AD = \sqrt{75} = 5\sqrt{3}$.
Since AB is perpendicular to AC, triangle ABC is a right triangle with the right angle at A. Also, triangle ABD is a right triangle with the right angle at D.
We have two right triangles ABD and ABC.
The triangles ABD and CBA are similar because angle B is common, and angle ADB = angle BAC = 90 degrees.
Since triangle ABD is similar to triangle CBA, we have the proportion $\frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{BD}{AB}$.
Substituting the known values, we have $\frac{10}{BC} = \frac{5}{10}$.
Therefore, $BC = \frac{10 \times 10}{5} = \frac{100}{5} = 20$.
