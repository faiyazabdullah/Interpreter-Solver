The question states that chords AC and DF are equidistant from the center. This means the chords are congruent.

Let's analyze the diagram. We have radius = 26. However, there's insufficient information to determine the exact length of AC. We don't know the distance from the center to the chords. Furthermore, we don't have enough information to determine AC using any other geometry property since we do not know angle measures. However, chords AC and DF are equidistant from G. Thus, the chords are the same length: AC = DF

In geometry, if two chords are equidistant from the center of the circle, then they are equal. So if AE=BG, then chord DF = Chord AC. In the image it appears that E is halfway from the chord DF to G, meaning it is half its length, similarly with point B on Chord AC.
However, given the limited information, it appears that there may be an error, and the solution might use information not depicted in the image.

Consider that if the chord goes through the center, then it is the diameter. However, AC would be smaller than the diameter.
If AC goes through the center G, then AC = 2*radius = 52.
Given that AC = DF, we would need to have enough information to discern what DF is.

The information given doesn't uniquely define the length of AC. If we assume the distance from the center to each chord is close to the radius, then AC will be close to zero. However, it doesn't seem the problem gives any assumption. We don't have enough information to calculate AC.

However, notice that Answer choice D is 48, which would be close to 52, but answer choices A, B, C are too small. So let us go through the steps and see if we can deduct using the image and apply the concepts. However, without the actual distance from G to either chord, we can't figure out it. Therefore it is incorrect to make assumptions.
Since this is multiple choice, the answer must be one of the above.
Since the question doesn't have any info about lengths or properties of it, we can't arrive to a conclusion.

Final Answer: D
