The sum of the angles in triangle LMN is 180 degrees. Therefore, angle N = 180 - 65 - 51 = 64 degrees.
The sum of the angles in triangle XYZ is 180 degrees. In the triangle XYZ, angle X = angle Y. Therefore, triangle XYZ is an isosceles triangle, so angle Z = angle X = 4x.
Then 4x + 4x + 4x = 180. 12x = 180, so x = 180/12 = 15
We are given two triangles. Angle M in triangle LMN is 51 degrees, and this corresponds to an angle in the triangle XYZ. Also, angle L in triangle LMN is 65 degrees, and this corresponds to an angle in the triangle XYZ, so angle L = 65 and angle X = 4x. Since these triangles have two matching angles, they must be congruent triangles. Angle LMN corresponds to XYZ. Angle LNM corresponds to XZY. And angle MLN corresponds to YXZ. Since the triangles are congruent, the measure of angle LNM is equal to the measure of angle XZY.
Therefore the measure of angle LNM = 180 - 51 - 65 = 64. Since angle Z = 4x and angle N = 64, 4x = 64, so x = 16.
