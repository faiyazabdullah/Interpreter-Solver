The image shows a regular pentagon inscribed in a circle. The radius of the circle is 10 cm.
We are asked to find the area of the shaded region formed by the circle and the regular pentagon.
This area is the difference between the area of the circle and the area of the pentagon.

The area of the circle is $\pi r^2 = \pi (10^2) = 100\pi \approx 314.159$.

To find the area of the regular pentagon, we divide it into 5 congruent isosceles triangles with the vertices at the center of the circle. The angle at the center is $360/5 = 72$ degrees.
The area of one triangle is $\frac{1}{2}ab\sin C$, where $a$ and $b$ are the two sides of length 10 cm (radius) and $C$ is the angle between them, which is 72 degrees.
Area of one triangle = $\frac{1}{2}(10)(10) \sin 72^\circ = 50 \sin 72^\circ \approx 50(0.951) = 47.55$.
Area of the pentagon = $5 \times 47.55 = 237.75$.
Area of the shaded region = Area of circle - Area of pentagon
$= 314.159 - 237.75 = 76.409$.
Rounding to the nearest tenth, the area of the shaded region is 76.4.
