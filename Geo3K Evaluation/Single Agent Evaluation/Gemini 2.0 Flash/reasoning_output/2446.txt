GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let $A, B, C$ be the vertices of the triangle.
Let $R$ be the midpoint of $AC$, $S$ be the midpoint of $AB$, and $T$ be the midpoint of $BC$.
The lines $BR, CT, AS$ are medians of the triangle $ABC$, and they intersect at the centroid $M$.
Given $MC = 7$, $RM = 4$, and $AT = 16$. We want to find $MB$.
The centroid divides each median in a 2:1 ratio, with the longer segment being between the centroid and the vertex.
Since $M$ is the centroid, we have $CM = 2 \cdot MR$ and $AM = 2 \cdot MS$ and $BM = 2 \cdot MT$.
$CM = 7$, $MR = 4$. We have $CM = 2 \cdot MR$. In this case, $CM = 2 \cdot MR \iff 7 = 2(4) = 8$, which is not true.
This means that $R, S, T$ are not necessarily the midpoints of $AC, AB, BC$ respectively.
The problem states that $MC=7$, $RM=4$, and $AT=16$. Since $M$ is the centroid, we have $CM=2MR$. In this case $CM = 7$, but $2MR = 2(4) = 8$, which is not equal to 7.
Given $AT=16$, we want to find $MB$. Since $M$ is the centroid, $AM = 2MT$. Therefore, $AT = AM + MT = 2MT + MT = 3MT$. Since $AT = 16$, we have $3MT = 16$, so $MT = \frac{16}{3}$.
$BM = 2MT = 2 \cdot \frac{16}{3} = \frac{32}{3} = 10.666...$
The closest answer is 10.
