Given that AB = 30 and CD = 30 in circle X. Since the lengths of the chords are equal, the arcs they subtend are also equal. Therefore, arc AB = arc CD.
We are given that m(arc CZ) = 40.
We need to find m(arc CD).
Since AB = CD, m(arc AB) = m(arc CD). However, we are not given the measure of arc AB.
We are given that m(arc CZ) = 40. The diagram shows that NZ is perpendicular to CD. Therefore, arc CN = arc ZD.
We are not given enough information to directly calculate m(arc CD).
Since AB = CD = 30, the arcs AB and CD are congruent, so m(arc AB) = m(arc CD).
Since m(arc CZ) = 40, and we don't have any further information about the position of Z, we can't determine the measure of arc CD.
However, if we assume that CZ is a chord and Z is a point on arc CD, then m(arc CD) might be 80 degrees. But we are not given that.
Without further information, we cannot determine m(arc CD).
Let's assume that we are supposed to find the value of m(arc ZD). Since CN = ZD, and m(arc CZ) = 40, we can't find anything further.

The problem states AB = 30 and CD = 30. This implies arc AB = arc CD. However, we don't know the degree measure of these arcs. We are given m(arc CZ) = 40.
The information is not sufficient to determine m(arc CD). Let's consider an extreme case. If Z=D, then m(arc CD) = 40. But it can be different.

It seems like there is a missing piece of information.
The answer cannot be determined from the information given.

If we assume that CZ is a chord and CZ is perpendicular to XD, then CZ is a short segment of arc CD.
If we assume Z is a point on CD such that m(CZ) = 40.

We cannot determine the measure of arc CD.
