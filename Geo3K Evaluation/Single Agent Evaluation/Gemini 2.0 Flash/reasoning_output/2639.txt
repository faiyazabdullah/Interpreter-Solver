Since QM and QP are angle bisectors of angles A and B respectively, and NM is perpendicular to MB and NP is perpendicular to NA, therefore NM = NP. Additionally, NQ is the same line for both triangle NMQ and triangle NPQ. Also, angles NMQ and NPQ are congruent since both are right angles. Based on the Hypotenuse-Leg Congruence Theorem for right triangles, if NM=NP and NQ is the same segment for both triangles, then triangle NMQ and triangle NPQ are congruent. This means that QM = QP.
Given that QM = 2x+2 and QP = 4x-8, we can solve for x as follows:
2x + 2 = 4x - 8
10 = 2x
x = 5
Substituting x = 5 into QM = 2x + 2:
QM = 2(5) + 2
QM = 10 + 2
QM = 12
