Let the radii of the circles with centers A, B, and C be $r_A$, $r_B$, and $r_C$ respectively.
Given diameters are 10, 30, and 10, so the radii are $r_A = 5$, $r_B = 15$, and $r_C = 5$.
We are given that $AZ \cong CW$ and $CW = 2$. Therefore, $AZ = 2$.
The distance from A to B is $r_A + r_B = 5 + 15 = 20$.
The distance from B to C is $r_B + r_C = 15 + 5 = 20$.
Therefore, $AB = 20$ and $BC = 20$.
We are given that $AZ = 2$ and $CW = 2$.
Since $Z$ lies on $AB$, we have $AZ = 2$.
Since $W$ lies on $BC$, we have $CW = 2$.
The distance $AC = AB + BC = 20 + 20 = 40$.
We need to find $AC$. $AC = AB + BC$. Since $Z$ is between $A$ and $X$, $A$ is at the center of circle with radius 5. Then $AX = 5$, so $AZ = 2$. $X$ is the point of intersection of circle A and circle B. Since $W$ is between $Y$ and $C$, $C$ is at the center of circle with radius 5. Then $CY = 5$, so $CW = 2$. $Y$ is the point of intersection of circle B and circle C.
$A, X, B, Y, C$ are collinear. Therefore $AC = AB + BC$.
$AB = AX + XB = 5 + 15 = 20$.
$BC = BY + YC = 15 + 5 = 20$.
$AC = 20 + 20 = 40$.
However, we are looking for $AC$.
$AC = AB + BC = 20 + 20 = 40$. $AZ = 2$ and $CW = 2$.
Since $AC = AB+BC$, $AB = 20$, $BC = 20$, $AC = 40$.
If we assume $A$, $B$, and $C$ are collinear, then $AC = AB + BC = 20+20 = 40$. However, we are given that $AZ \cong CW = 2$. This does not affect the distance $AC$. But we can say that the distance between the origin $A$ and the center $C$ is $AC=AB+BC = r_A + r_B + r_B + r_C = 5+15+15+5 = 40$.
