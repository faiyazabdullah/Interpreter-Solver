The parallel lines l and m are intersected by the transversal line segment AB and BC.
Since the lines are parallel, alternate interior angles are equal.
The angle between line l and AB is 38 degrees. The alternate interior angle is angle ABC.
Also the angle between the line m and BC is 33 degrees. The alternate interior angle is angle BCA.
Angle ABC is equal to 38 degrees and angle BCA is equal to 33 degrees.
The question asks for the measure of angle ABC.
The angle ABC is the sum of the angles at point B.
The interior angles are alternate angles.
Therefore, angle ABC = 38 degrees + 33 degrees = 71 degrees.

Final Answer: D
