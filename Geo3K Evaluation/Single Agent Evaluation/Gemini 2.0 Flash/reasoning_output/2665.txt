The two triangles are similar. We can set up a proportion to find the value of x.
12 / (y+4) = 15 / 12
12 / 2x = 15 / 12
12 * 12 = 15 * 2x
144 = 30x
x = 144 / 30
x = 4.8

Now we have to set up another proportion:
12 / 15 = 20 / 12
12/12 = 2x/(y+4)
12 / 15 = 12 / (y+4)
15 = 20

Since the triangles are similar, we can set up the proportion:
12/(y+4) = 20/15
Cross-multiply:
12 * 15 = 20 * (y+4)
180 = 20y + 80
100 = 20y
y = 5

12/12 = 2x/(y+4)
12 / 15 = (2x) / 12
Cross-multiply:
12*12 = 15*2x
144 = 30x
x = 144/30
x = 4.8
2x = 2*4.8 = 9.6
However, we should have set up the correct proportion.

We are given that the two triangles are similar. The sides with lengths 12 and 12 are corresponding sides. Likewise, the sides with lengths 20 and 15 are corresponding sides. So the side with length 2x corresponds to the side with length y+4.
So we have the following proportion:
12/12 = 20/15 = (2x)/(y+4)
Since 12/12=1, we have that 20/15 is incorrect!
12 / 15 = 2x / 12
12 / 15 = (y+4) / 12
12/15 = 12/15
12/15 = 2x/12 implies 2x = 12*12/15 = 144/15 = 48/5 = 9.6, so x = 4.8
12/15 = (y+4)/12 implies y+4 = 12*12/15 = 144/15 = 48/5 = 9.6, so y = 5.6

We are given the sides 12 and 2x in the left triangle correspond to y+4 and 12 in the right triangle. The side 20 on the left corresponds to side 15 on the right.
Therefore, 12/12 = (2x)/(y+4) = 20/15.
Since 20/15 = 4/3, we can deduce 12/12 =1 implies 4/3 is incorrect
From 12/y+4 = 20/15 => 12*15 = 20(y+4) => 180 = 20y + 80 => 100 = 20y => y=5
From 2x/12 = 20/15 => 2x = 12*20/15 = 12*4/3 = 4*4 = 16 => x=8.
