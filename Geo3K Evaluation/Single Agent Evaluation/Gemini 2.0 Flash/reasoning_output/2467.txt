The angles around point $C$ must add up to $360^\circ$.
We have the angles $(x-1)^\circ$, $60^\circ$, $(3x+5)^\circ$, and $m\angle NCL$.
Therefore, $(x-1) + 60 + (3x+5) + m\angle NCL = 360$.
Also, the angles around point $C$ are $\angle RCM = (x-1)^\circ$, $\angle MCN = 60^\circ$, $\angle NCL = (3x+5)^\circ$, $\angle RCL$.
From the figure, we can deduce that $\angle RCM = x-1$ and $\angle NCL = 3x+5$.
So we must find the value of $3x+5$.
Since the arc measures must add up to $360^\circ$, we have $x-1 + 60 + 3x+5 = 360$.
Combining terms, we have $4x + 64 = 360$, so $4x = 296$, and $x = \frac{296}{4} = 74$.
Then $m\angle NCL = 3x+5 = 3(74)+5 = 222+5 = 227$.
Since the arc around the circle measures 360 degrees, we have $(x-1) + 60 + m\angle NCL = 360$. Then $m\angle NCL = 360 - 60 - (x-1) = 301-x$.
If $x=74$, $301-74 = 227$. However, this doesn't appear to be the correct approach, so we have the angles around $C$ equal $360^\circ$. Therefore, $m \angle MCL = 60$. $\angle MCN = 60$, so $\angle NCL = x$. We have $360-(60)=300$.
The given information states that $x-1$ and $3x+5$ are angles in the circle. The question asks for $\angle NCL$, which is $3x+5$.
From the figure $x-1 + 60 + 3x+5 + \angle NCL = 360$. Since we have three angles $x-1, 60, 3x+5$, we can say that $4x+64=143$, therefore $4x=143-64$, $4x = 79$, $x=19.75$.
Since $\angle RCM = x-1$, and $\angle NCL = 3x+5$, we have $\angle NCL = 3x+5 = 3(74)+5 = 227$. However, we know that we have a total of $360$, therefore $360-227-60 = 73$

$x-1+60 = 360- (3x+5) - (60) = 300 - 3x - 5 = 295-3x$. $x-1 + 60 = 59 + x$.

The question asks to find the value of $3x+5$. However, from this information, we cannot find it directly since the only equation we derive is $x+60+3x+5 + a=360$, where a is angle $NCL$.
If we assume the central angles have to sum up to 180 instead of 360 for some reason, we have $(x-1) + 60 + (3x+5) = 180 \Rightarrow 4x+64=180 \Rightarrow 4x = 116 \Rightarrow x = 29$. Then $3x+5 = 3(29)+5 = 87+5=92$. This doesn't correspond to any of the options.
Without knowing the relations between those three angles, we can assume x to be a value.
However, $m \angle NCL = 3x+5$.
$4x + 64 + \angle NCL = 360$.
We are trying to calculate $\angle NCL$, so $m \angle NCL = 360 - 4x - 64$.
$ = 296 - 4x$
