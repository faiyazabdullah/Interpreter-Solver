The figure shows a square circumscribed around a circle. The side length of the square is 14 yd. Since the square is circumscribed around the circle, the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square, which is 14 yd. The radius of the circle is half of the diameter, so the radius is 14/2 = 7 yd.
The circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = 2 * pi * r, where r is the radius of the circle. In this case, the radius is 7 yd, so the circumference is C = 2 * pi * 7 = 14 * pi yd.

Final Answer: B
