The image shows a right triangle ABC, where angle C is a right angle. The length of the hypotenuse AB is 27, and the length of side BC is 18. We are asked to find the measure of angle A.
We can use trigonometric ratios to find the measure of angle A. In particular, we can use the cosine function, which relates the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. In this case, the side adjacent to angle A is AC, and the hypotenuse is AB. However, we are given the length of BC which is opposite to angle A.
Using sine, we have:
sin(A) = opposite / hypotenuse = BC / AB = 18 / 27 = 2 / 3
To find the measure of angle A, we take the inverse sine (arcsin) of 2/3.
A = arcsin(2/3) ≈ 41.81 degrees
Rounding to the nearest tenth, we get A ≈ 41.8 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of angle A is approximately 41.8 degrees.
