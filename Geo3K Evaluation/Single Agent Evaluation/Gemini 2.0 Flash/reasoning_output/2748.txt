QUESTION:
Which of the following facts would be sufficient to prove that line d is parallel to X Z?

CHOICES:
A. \angle 1 \cong \angle 3
B. \angle 1 \cong \angle Z
C. \angle 2 \cong \angle X
D. \angle 3 \cong \angle Z

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let line d be the line containing points A and B. We want to prove that line d is parallel to line XZ.

A. If \angle 1 \cong \angle 3, this means that triangle XYZ is an isosceles triangle with XY = YZ. This doesn't help to prove that line d is parallel to line XZ.

B. If \angle 1 \cong \angle Z, then since \angle 1 and \angle Z are alternate interior angles, it would follow that line d is parallel to line XZ.

C. If \angle 2 \cong \angle X, this also doesn't help to prove that line d is parallel to line XZ.

D. If \angle 3 \cong \angle Z, this doesn't help to prove that line d is parallel to line XZ.

Therefore, the only option that would be sufficient to prove that line d is parallel to XZ is B.

Final Answer: B
