GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Quadrilateral ABCD is a rectangle.
The diagonals of a rectangle are equal and bisect each other.
Therefore, AE = BE = CE = DE.
Triangle ABE is an isosceles triangle with AE = BE.
So, angle 2 = angle 6 = 40 degrees.
Since ABCD is a rectangle, angle ABC = 90 degrees.
Therefore, angle 6 + angle 5 = 90 degrees.
So, angle 5 = 90 - 40 = 50 degrees.
Triangle CDE is an isosceles triangle with CE = DE.
Therefore, angle 7 = angle 3.
Also, angle 7 = angle 6 = 40 degrees since they are alternate interior angles with parallel lines AB and CD and transversal AC.
Since AE = DE, triangle ADE is an isosceles triangle. Therefore, angle 2 = angle 4 = 40 degrees.
Also, angle 1 = angle 3 since they are alternate interior angles with parallel lines AB and CD and transversal AD.
Since ABCD is a rectangle, angle ADC = 90 degrees.
Therefore, angle 3 + angle 4 = 90 degrees.
So, angle 3 = 90 - 40 = 50 degrees.
Therefore, angle 3 = 50 degrees.
