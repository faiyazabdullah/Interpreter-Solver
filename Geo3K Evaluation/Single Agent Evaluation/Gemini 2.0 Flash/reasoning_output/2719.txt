Given that lines p and q are parallel.
The angle at A is (3x - 60) degrees.
The angle at F is (2x + 15) degrees.
Since p and q are parallel, the angles (3x - 60) and (2x + 15) are supplementary, which means they add up to 180 degrees.
So, (3x - 60) + (2x + 15) = 180
5x - 45 = 180
5x = 225
x = 45
Now we can find the angle at F:
Angle F = 2x + 15 = 2(45) + 15 = 90 + 15 = 105 degrees
Since angle FCE and angle CFA are supplementary, they add up to 180 degrees.
However, we are looking for angle FCE.
Since lines p and q are parallel, the angle DAE and angle FEC are alternate interior angles, and therefore equal.
Angle DAE = 3x - 60 = 3(45) - 60 = 135 - 60 = 75 degrees
Since angle DAE and angle FCE are corresponding angles, they are supplementary.
Angle ACE = 180 - Angle F = 180 - 105 = 75
However, angle FCE and angle DAE are supplementary. Angle DAE is 3x-60, and angle FCE is what we are trying to find. Angles DAE and CFE are corresponding. CFE= 2x+15.
3x-60 and 2x+15 are same side interior angles.
Thus, 3x-60+2x+15= 180.
5x-45=180
5x=225
x=45
Then m\angle FCE= m\angle CFE=2x+15= 2(45)+15=90+15=105
m\angle FCE =180-75 = 105
m \angle F C E + (3x - 60) = 180
Then m \angle F C E + 3(45) - 60 = 180
m \angle F C E + 135 - 60 = 180
m \angle F C E + 75 = 180
Thus, m \angle F C E = 180 - 75
m \angle F C E = 105
