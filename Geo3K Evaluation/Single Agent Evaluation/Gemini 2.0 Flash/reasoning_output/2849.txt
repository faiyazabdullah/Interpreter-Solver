From the image, it is observed that angle 4 and angle 5 are interior angles on the same side of the transversal. Since the lines are parallel, these angles are supplementary, so their sum is 180 degrees.
Therefore, m∠4 + m∠5 = 180.
Substituting the given expressions for the angles:
(2y + 32) + (3y - 3) = 180
Combining like terms:
5y + 29 = 180
Subtracting 29 from both sides:
5y = 180 - 29
5y = 151
Dividing by 5:
y = 151 / 5
y = 30.2

Since 30.2 is not an available choice, we need to find if there is a mistake in the question.

The diagram shows that the lines are parallel, thus angle 4 + angle 5 = 180 degrees.

2y + 32 + 3y - 3 = 180
5y + 29 = 180
5y = 151
y = 30.2

Let's consider m∠5 + m∠7 = 180 degrees (linear pair)
m∠7 = m∠4 (vertical angles)
Therefore m∠5 + m∠4 = 180

Let's assume lines AE and DE are not parallel, then angle 4 and angle 5 are not supplementary angles. It could be that angle 4 and angle 6 are supplementary angles.
m∠6 = 180 - 3y + 3.  Also m∠2 = m∠6 and m∠2 + m∠4 = 180

Consider the case where the angles are alternate interior angles. Then
2y + 32 = 3y - 3
y = 35

Check the given angle measures for this y:
m∠4 = 2(35) + 32 = 70 + 32 = 102
m∠5 = 3(35) - 3 = 105 - 3 = 102

If m∠4 and m∠5 are equal, then the lines are parallel only if m∠4 + m∠8 = 180
