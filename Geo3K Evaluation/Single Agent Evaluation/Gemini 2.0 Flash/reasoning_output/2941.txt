The question asks for the measure of a central angle.
A square is inscribed in the circle. The central angles that correspond to the sides of the square are congruent. Since there are four sides in a square, the circle is divided into four equal arcs, each subtended by a side of the square. The central angle subtended by each side is therefore 360/4 = 90 degrees.
FG is perpendicular to CD, so angle FGC is 90 degrees. However, angle CFG is NOT a central angle that subtends a side of the square, so that is incorrect.
The central angles subtending a side of the square are angles like angle AKB, angle BKD, angle DKC, and angle CKA. Each of these angles is 90 degrees.

Final Answer: C
