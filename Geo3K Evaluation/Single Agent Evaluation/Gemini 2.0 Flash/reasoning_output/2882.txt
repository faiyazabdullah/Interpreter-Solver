QUESTION:
G H \cong K J. Find x.

CHOICES:
A. 27
B. 54
C. 55
D. 83

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Based on the geometric figure, we are given that arc GH is congruent to arc KJ.
The measure of arc GH is given as 83 degrees.
The measure of arc KJ is given as (2x - 27) degrees.
Since the arcs are congruent, their measures must be equal. Therefore, we have the equation:
2x - 27 = 83
Adding 27 to both sides, we get:
2x = 83 + 27
2x = 110
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
x = 110 / 2
x = 55
Now we compare the calculated value of x with the given answer choices:
A. 27
B. 54
C. 55
D. 83
The calculated value of x is 55, which matches answer choice C.
