B. 4
C. 5
D. 10

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

The problem states that W T Y \cong T W Y. This seems to imply that arcs WY and TY are congruent. Therefore, the measures of the arcs must be equal.
Arc TY is given as 4x. Arc WY is given as 2x + 10.

Thus, we have the equation:
4x = 2x + 10
Subtract 2x from both sides:
4x - 2x = 2x + 10 - 2x
2x = 10
Divide by 2:
x = 10 / 2
x = 5

Now, let's check if this makes sense in the diagram.
Arc TY = 4x = 4(5) = 20
Arc WY = 2x + 10 = 2(5) + 10 = 10 + 10 = 20

Since the arc measures are equal, our value of x=5 is correct.

Comparing our answer to the answer choices, we see that x=5 corresponds to answer choice C.
