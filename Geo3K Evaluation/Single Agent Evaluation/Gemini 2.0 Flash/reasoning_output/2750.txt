C. 126
D. 252

The figure can be divided into a rectangle and four triangles.
The rectangle has dimensions 14 ft and 9 ft. The area of the rectangle is 14 * 9 = 126 sq ft.

The four triangles are congruent. Let's determine the area of one triangle.
The base of the triangle is half the length of the rectangle which is 14 / 2 = 7 ft. The height of the triangle is half the height of the rectangle, which is 9 / 2 = 4.5 ft.

Area of one triangle = 0.5 * base * height = 0.5 * 7 * 4.5 = 0.5 * 31.5 = 15.75 sq ft.
The area of the four triangles combined is 4 * 15.75 = 63 sq ft.

The total area of the figure is the sum of the rectangle and the four triangles.
Total area = 126 + 63 = 189 sq ft.

However, we need to find the area of the shaded portion.
The area of the rectangle is 14 * 9 = 126
The area of one parallelogram is base * height.
The base is 14, height is 4.5, and area = 14*4.5 = 63
The area of the other parallelogram is base * height.
The base is 9, height is 7, and area = 9*7 = 63.

The total area is the sum of these = 63+63 = 126/2 = 63

Area of one triangle = 1/2 * 7 * 4.5 = 15.75
Total area is 4 * 15.75 = 63

The total shaded area can be calculated as the sum of the two parallelograms.
Area = 63+63 = 126
