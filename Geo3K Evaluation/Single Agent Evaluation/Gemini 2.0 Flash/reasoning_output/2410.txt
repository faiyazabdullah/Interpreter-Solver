GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

The figure suggests that ABC is a triangle and EDB is another triangle. Also, it looks like CBED is a parallelogram. If CBED is indeed a parallelogram, then CB = DE and CD = BE.
We are given AC = x - 3, BE = 20, AB = 16, and CD = x + 5.
Since CD = BE, we can write:
x + 5 = 20
x = 20 - 5
x = 15
Now we can find AC:
AC = x - 3 = 15 - 3 = 12
And CD:
CD = x + 5 = 15 + 5 = 20

Therefore, CD = 20. However, none of the provided options are 20. It is possible there is an error in the problem statement or the diagram is misleading. The most likely case is that CD = BE = 20, and there is no other relationship to find. Still, none of the answer choices are 20. Since the problem doesn't mention similar triangles or parallelograms, we can only use the given information.

We have x + 5 = 20, so x = 15.
If we consider that there may be some relationship with the side lengths:
AC = 12, AB = 16, and CD = 20. BE = 20.
It's possible there's an assumption we need to make about the relationship between AB and AC or some other sides. The problem is missing key details.
Without additional information or assumptions, the given information only allows us to find x = 15, and CD = 20.

Let's reassess the question and the given information.
AC = x - 3
BE = 20
AB = 16
CD = x + 5

Since CD = BE, then x + 5 = 20, so x = 15. Thus, CD = 20.

Since none of the answers are 20, it's possible that CD is not equal to BE. We cannot solve this problem without more information or the ability to make assumptions about the diagram. Let's review the information given, and assume there's a typo in the problem and that one of the sides is related to CD. If we try some of the answer choices, say, if CD = 32 (Choice A), then
x + 5 = 32, so x = 27.
AC = x - 3 = 27 - 3 = 24.

There's still not enough information to go forward. If we assume that the figure CBED is a parallelogram, then CD = BE = 20, and there are no further relationships. The problem is flawed. Let's assume that there's a different interpretation.
