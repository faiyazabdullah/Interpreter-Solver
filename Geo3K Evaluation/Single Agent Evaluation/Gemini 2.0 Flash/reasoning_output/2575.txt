GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

The angles subtended by the same arc are equal. Therefore, m \angle R = m \angle Q = 32^\circ.
Since RS || QT, m \angle S = m \angle T.
Also, the arc RT corresponds to the inscribed angle RQT = 32^\circ.
Thus m \angle RQT = 32^\circ = \frac{1}{2} m \text{arc } RT, and so m \text{arc } RT = 2(32^\circ) = 64^\circ.
Also, m \text{arc } RS = 5x+4 and m \text{arc } QT = 6x-2.
If RS || QT, then arc RQ = arc ST, and therefore the angles RST = QTS.
Therefore, 5x+4 = 6x-2.
Then 6 = x.
m \text{arc } RS = 5x+4 = 5(6)+4 = 34^\circ.
m \text{arc } QT = 6x-2 = 6(6)-2 = 34^\circ.
The inscribed angle theorem says that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
m \angle T = \frac{1}{2} m \text{arc } RS = \frac{1}{2}(5x+4) = \frac{1}{2}(5(6)+4) = \frac{1}{2}(34) = 17^\circ
m \angle S = \frac{1}{2} m \text{arc } QT = \frac{1}{2}(6x-2) = \frac{1}{2}(6(6)-2) = \frac{1}{2}(34) = 17^\circ
However, we also have the inscribed angles \angle R and \angle Q, which are given as 32^\circ.
If we instead assume that the arcs themselves are equal, then 5x+4 = 6x-2 => x = 6.
Therefore, 5(6)+4 = 34, and 6(6)-2 = 34.
m \angle RQT = 32^\circ, m \angle TSR = ?
m \angle TSR = \frac{1}{2} mQT = \frac{1}{2} (6x-2)
However, since RS || QT, mRQ = mTS
Then since the inscribed angles RQ = m(arcRQ) and TS = m(arcTS)
m \angle RTS = \frac{1}{2} (5x+4) = \frac{1}{2} (34) = 17^\circ
If the arcs are the same size, then their inscribed angles are the same size, which we found to be 17.
Since m \angle R = m \angle Q = 32, m arc QT = 64 and m arc RS = 64
Also we found x=6, and so m RS = 34
Therefore we need a relationship of the circle, arcs, and angles
We are given arc RS = 5x+4 = 34,
QT = 6x-2 = 34, QT = 64? RS=64?
There must be an error.

Let $\angle S = y$. Then $\angle T = y$.
$\angle RQT = 32$. Then m arc RT = 64.
Arc RS = 5x+4 and QT = 6x-2.
Arc RT + Arc RS + arc ST + arc TQ + arc QR = 360.
