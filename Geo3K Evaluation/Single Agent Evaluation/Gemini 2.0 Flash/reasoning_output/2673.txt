In circle R, we are given US = 5 and SR = 6. We need to find TV.
Since US is perpendicular to TV, US bisects TV (a theorem: if a radius or diameter is perpendicular to a chord, then it bisects the chord). So, TS = SV. Thus, TV = 2*TS.

Also, R is the center of the circle. Therefore, RT = RU = RS + SR = radius of circle R.
Since SR = 6, RT = RU = 6.
Using the Pythagorean theorem on triangle UST, we have:
$US^2 + TS^2 = UT^2$
$US^2 + TS^2 = (2 * RT)^2$
$5^2 + TS^2 = RT^2 = 6^2$
Also, RT = radius of the circle. So RT = 6.
Then RT = 6.
We know US = 5. Triangle TSU is a right triangle with hypotenuse UT, where UT is a chord of the circle.
TS^2 + US^2 = RU^2
However, RU is not known to be 6 (radius)

Since SR=6 is the radius and US=5. Let's calculate RT.
$TS^2+US^2=RT^2$
Since SR = radius = 6, then RT = 6.
TS^2 + 5^2 = 6^2
TS^2 + 25 = 36
TS^2 = 11
TS = $\sqrt{11}$

Since TV = 2 * TS, we have
TV = $2\sqrt{11}$
TV = 2 * 3.3166
TV = 6.6332

Since US is not a diameter, we can say RU = RT = 6. However the center is R and not S
Also, TV is the diameter of the circle. Since TS = SV. TV= TS + SV. Since US = 5 is perpendicular to TV, it doesn't necessarily bisect TV. So T and V are not the same distance from S
Let's try to understand the given values and what we are trying to find

Let RU = RT = Radius
RS = 6. Since TS is perpendicular to US.
Using the Pythagorean Theorem. RT^2 = RS^2 + TS^2
radius^2 =  SR^2
Let X = TS
6^2+TS^2=RU^2

We cannot make assumption that RU is 6
TV = TS + SV

We are given that the radius is SR = 6. Thus RT = RV = 6
Let TS be x.
Thus x^2+5^2= (6+x)^2

We know that SR = 6
So from R, RT = 6. So TS * SV = US^2
TV = TS + SV
Let TS be x. TV= x + SV
We also know that TS perpendicular to UV

Then TR = VR = 6
x(12-x) = 5^2=25
TV=x where 

Using intersecting chords theorem, UT is a chord, and TV is chord intersecting at S.
TS * VS = US^2 + (RT+RS)(RT-RS)
(TR=6=radius SR=6)(radius^2-length^2)$TS*SV$ =US$^2$
