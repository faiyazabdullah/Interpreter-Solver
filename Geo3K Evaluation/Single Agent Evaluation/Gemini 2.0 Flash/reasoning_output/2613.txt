Let's denote the angle at B as $\angle B$, the angle at D as $\angle D$, and the angle at E as $\angle E$.
We are given that $\angle B = (x + 2.5)^\circ$, $\angle D = 50^\circ$, and $\angle E = (4x + 5)^\circ$.
Since the tangent chord angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc, we have $\angle B = \frac{1}{2} \text{arc }CD$, so $\text{arc }CD = 2(x+2.5) = (2x+5)^\circ$.
Also, the inscribed angle $\angle E = \frac{1}{2} \text{arc }CD$, so $\text{arc }CD = 2(4x+5) = (8x+10)^\circ$.
Thus, we have $2x+5 = 8x+10$, which gives $-5 = 6x$, or $x = -\frac{5}{6}$. This is not possible since the angles would be negative.
Instead, let's consider the exterior angle theorem. The measure of the exterior angle at B is equal to the sum of the two remote interior angles.
So, we have $\angle D = \angle B + \angle E$. Substituting the given values, we get
$50 = (x + 2.5) + (4x + 5)$
$50 = 5x + 7.5$
$50 - 7.5 = 5x$
$42.5 = 5x$
$x = \frac{42.5}{5} = 8.5$

Now we check the angles:
$\angle B = x + 2.5 = 8.5 + 2.5 = 11^\circ$
$\angle E = 4x + 5 = 4(8.5) + 5 = 34 + 5 = 39^\circ$
The sum of the angles is $11 + 39 = 50$, so $\angle D = 50^\circ$.

The problem states that the figure shows BDE is a triangle and BD is tangent to the circle at D.
Also, BC is secant. $\angle B=(x+2.5)^\circ$, the arc CD $=50^\circ$ and $\angle E = (4x+5)^\circ$.
By Tangent-Chord Angle Theorem, the measure of an angle formed by a chord and a tangent that has its vertex on the circle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.
$m\angle BDE=\frac{\text{arc CE}}{2}$, so we have $m\angle BDE = \frac{50^\circ}{2} = 25^\circ$ (incorrect)

Using the exterior angle theorem, we have: $\angle EDC=\angle B +\angle E$
So $180-\angle BDC = (x+2.5)+(4x+5)=5x+7.5$
Also $\angle BDC=50$ is given, so $180-50=130$
$130=(x+2.5)+(4x+5)$
Since angle D is $50^\circ$. We know the angle CDB must be $180^\circ - 50^\circ= 130^\circ$
The sum of interior angles in the triangle is $180$
$(x+2.5)+(4x+5)+m\angle BDC=180$

In $\triangle BDE$: $\angle B + \angle E + \angle BDE = 180^{\circ}$
We have $\angle B = x + 2.5$ and $\angle E = 4x + 5$
We know that $\angle BDE = 180 - 50 - m \angle EDC = 180 - \angle BDC = 130$
$130=m \angle BDC = 180-x-2.5 - 4x -5= 130$
$m\angle BCE=\angle BDC + \angle E $
From $D=50^{\circ}$, $x=\frac{D-7.5}{5} = \frac{50-7.5}{5}=\frac{42.5}{5}=8.5$
Since $x = 8.5$ then we get $x+2.5= 11 $ , so
Consider that 27.5 +4(x) is correct or A is not possible since C is not 50

Consider: The angle that is 50 degree is an exterior angle of the inscribed angle ($x+2.5$ + 5)
so exterior angle = 2 angle

The question requires me to find x. There must be a solution.
We can estimate that A and B cannot be correct because the arcs will have less than 90 degrees. So $C$ or $D$ is correct since the tangent chords will pass 90 degrees.
