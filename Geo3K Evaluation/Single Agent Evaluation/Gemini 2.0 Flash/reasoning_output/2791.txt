Let's analyze the given information. We have a circle and a point F outside the circle. From F, two secants are drawn to the circle, namely FH and FJ. We are given that FG = 18, GH = 42, and FK = 15. We need to find the length of KJ, which is denoted by 'a'.

By the Power of a Point theorem, the product of the lengths of the segments from F to the circle along one secant is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments from F to the circle along the other secant.
In this case, we have:
FG * FH = FK * FJ
We are given FG = 18 and GH = 42. Therefore, FH = FG + GH = 18 + 42 = 60.
We are also given FK = 15. Let KJ = a. Then FJ = FK + KJ = 15 + a.
Now we can write the equation as:
18 * 60 = 15 * (15 + a)
1080 = 225 + 15a
15a = 1080 - 225
15a = 855
a = 855 / 15
a = 57

So, KJ = a = 57.
