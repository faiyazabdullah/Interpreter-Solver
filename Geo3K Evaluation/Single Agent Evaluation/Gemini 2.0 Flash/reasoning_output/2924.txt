The given triangle ABC is a right triangle with angle A being the right angle. The side AB has a length of 3 and the side BC has a length of 5. We need to find cos C.

First, we need to find the length of side AC. Since triangle ABC is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
$AB^2 + AC^2 = BC^2$
$3^2 + AC^2 = 5^2$
$9 + AC^2 = 25$
$AC^2 = 25 - 9$
$AC^2 = 16$
$AC = \sqrt{16} = 4$

Now we have all the sides of the triangle: AB = 3, AC = 4, and BC = 5.

We need to find cos C. In a right triangle, cosine of an angle is defined as the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse.
In this case, for angle C, the adjacent side is AC and the hypotenuse is BC.
So, $\cos C = \frac{AC}{BC} = \frac{4}{5}$

Comparing this result with the answer choices, we find that choice C is $\frac{4}{5}$.

Final Answer: C
