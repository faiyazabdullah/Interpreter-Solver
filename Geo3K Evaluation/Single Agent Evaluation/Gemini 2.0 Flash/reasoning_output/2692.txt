The problem gives that the total length from W to F is 14 and the length from W' to F is 10.5. We want to find x, which is the length from W to W'.
Since the length from W to F is the sum of the length from W to W' and the length from W' to F, we can write the equation:
WF = WW' + W'F
14 = x + 10.5
Subtract 10.5 from both sides:
14 - 10.5 = x
x = 3.5

Final Answer: A
