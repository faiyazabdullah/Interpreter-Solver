The image shows a circle with a shaded region that is a semicircle. The diameter of the circle is given as x cm, which is also the height of the shaded region. The area of the shaded semicircle is given as 66 cm^2.

The area of a circle is given by the formula A = pi * r^2, where r is the radius of the circle. Since the shaded region is a semicircle, its area is half the area of the full circle. So, the area of the semicircle is (1/2) * pi * r^2.

Given that the area of the semicircle is 66 cm^2, we have:
(1/2) * pi * r^2 = 66
pi * r^2 = 132
r^2 = 132 / pi
r = sqrt(132 / pi)

Since x is the diameter of the circle, x = 2r.
x = 2 * sqrt(132 / pi)

Using the value of pi as approximately 3.14159:
r^2 = 132 / 3.14159 ≈ 42.0167
r ≈ sqrt(42.0167) ≈ 6.482
x = 2 * r ≈ 2 * 6.482 ≈ 12.964

The value of x is approximately 12.964, which is closest to 13.0.
