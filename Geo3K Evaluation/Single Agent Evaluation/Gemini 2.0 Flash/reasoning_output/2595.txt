A. 4
B. 6
C. 9
D. 12

The diameter of circle S is 30, so the radius of circle S is 15. The diameter of circle R is 20, so the radius of circle R is 10.
Let's denote the center of circle S as S and the center of circle R as R.
DS = 9
Then CS = CD + DS = 15 (radius of circle S).
Therefore, CD = CS - DS = 15 - 9 = 6
RC is the radius of circle R, so RC = 10.
Let's analyze the line segment between the center of the two circles. RS = RC + CD + DS
RS = radius of circle R + CD + DS
RS = RC + CD + DS
RS = 10 + CD + 9
RS = 10 + 6 + 9 = 25
RS is the distance between the centers of the circles.

The centers R and S are on the same line as points C, D, and B.
The length of RB is the radius of circle R which is 10.
The length of SB is the radius of circle S which is 15.
RS = RB + BS = 10 + 15 = 25.
Now we know RS = 25 and DS = 9.
CD = 6.
Then RC = radius of circle R = 10.
We are asked to find RC.

Since RC is the radius of circle R, then RC = 10.

The problem might be that the value of DS=9 is inconsistent. In that case, DS = 15.
Then CD = CS - DS = 15 - 15 = 0
RC + CD + DS = RS
RC + 0 + 15 = 25
RC = 10
Therefore, we conclude that the radius of circle R is 10.

It appears there is an error in the figure, since RC is marked on the figure as the radius of circle R.
