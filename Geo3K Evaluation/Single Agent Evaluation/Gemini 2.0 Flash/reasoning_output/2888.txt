Let's analyze the two triangles. We can observe that the two triangles are similar.

In the left triangle, let's denote the triangle as $\triangle EFG$, and in the right triangle, let's denote it as $\triangle ADC$.
We are given that $FG = 12$ and $AD = 10$, and $CD = 15$.
Also, we have two pairs of congruent angles, $\angle F \cong \angle C$ and $\angle G \cong \angle B$, so $\angle EFG \cong \angle ADC$ and $\angle EFG \cong \angle ABC$. In addition, $FG = GH = HB = BD = DC$, so the ratio is $FG / CD = 12/15 = 4/5$. The angles at F and C are congruent. If the other angles at G and B are congruent, then the triangles EFG and ADB are similar.

However, angles $G$ and $B$ are congruent, so the triangles are similar by the angle-angle criterion. Then the ratio of corresponding sides are the same:

$EG/AD = FG/CD$
$x/10 = 12/15$
$x = 10*(12/15)$
$x = 10*(4/5)$
$x = 2*4 = 8$
Therefore, $x = 8$.
