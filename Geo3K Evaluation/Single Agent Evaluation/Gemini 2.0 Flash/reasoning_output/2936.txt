The image shows a right triangle NPM, where angle P is a right angle.
The side lengths are:
NP = 15
PM = 36
NM = 39

We are asked to find tan M.
In a right triangle, the tangent of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side.
Therefore, tan M = opposite / adjacent = NP / PM = 15 / 36

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 3:
15 / 36 = 5 / 12

Now, we need to convert the fraction 5/12 to a decimal to the nearest hundredth.
5/12 = 0.416666...
Rounding to the nearest hundredth, we get 0.42.

Final Answer: B
