The perimeter of parallelogram ABCD is 22. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in length. Therefore, AB = CD and AD = BC.
From the diagram, AB = 2y + 1, CD = 3 - 4w, AD = 3x - 2, and BC = x - w + 1.
Since AB = CD, we have 2y + 1 = 3 - 4w, which simplifies to 2y + 4w = 2, or y + 2w = 1.
Since AD = BC, we have 3x - 2 = x - w + 1, which simplifies to 2x + w = 3.
The perimeter of the parallelogram is AB + BC + CD + DA = 22.
Since AB = CD and AD = BC, we can write the perimeter as 2(AB) + 2(BC) = 22, which simplifies to AB + BC = 11.
Substituting the expressions for AB and BC, we have (2y + 1) + (x - w + 1) = 11, which simplifies to 2y + x - w + 2 = 11, or 2y + x - w = 9.
We have the following equations:
1. y + 2w = 1
2. 2x + w = 3
3. 2y + x - w = 9
From equation (1), y = 1 - 2w.
From equation (2), x = (3 - w)/2.
Substitute these into equation (3):
2(1 - 2w) + (3 - w)/2 - w = 9
2 - 4w + (3 - w)/2 - w = 9
Multiply by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
4 - 8w + 3 - w - 2w = 18
7 - 11w = 18
-11w = 11
w = -1
Now, substitute w = -1 into the equations for x and y:
x = (3 - (-1))/2 = (3 + 1)/2 = 4/2 = 2
y = 1 - 2(-1) = 1 + 2 = 3
Now we can find the length of AB:
AB = 2y + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7
BC = x - w + 1 = 2 - (-1) + 1 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4
So AB = 7 and BC = 4.
Perimeter = 2(AB) + 2(BC) = 2(7) + 2(4) = 14 + 8 = 22.
Thus, AB = 7.
