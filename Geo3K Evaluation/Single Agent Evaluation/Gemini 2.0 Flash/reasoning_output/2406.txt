QUESTION:
Find the value of x in the diagram.

CHOICES:
A. 68
B. 78
C. 79
D. 136

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The angles (x-1)째 and 79째 are supplementary, so (x-1) + 79 = 180.
x - 1 + 79 = 180
x + 78 = 180
x = 180 - 78
x = 102

The angles (x+10)째 and 2x째 are supplementary, so (x+10) + 2x = 180.
x + 10 + 2x = 180
3x + 10 = 180
3x = 170
x = 170/3 = 56.67

However, since lines BF and CI are parallel, the angles at B and I sum up to 180.
Thus, the angle at B is 180-79 = 101 degrees. Then x-1 = 101, which means x=102.
Since lines DC and IG are parallel, the angles at C and I sum up to 180.
Thus, (x+10) + 2x = 180.
3x + 10 = 180.
3x = 170.
x = 170/3 = 56.667

If we instead assume lines ED and IG are parallel, then (x-1) + (x+10) = 180.
2x + 9 = 180
2x = 171
x = 85.5
This gives angles of 84.5, 79 and 95.5. 84.5 + 79+95.5 = 259 which is not a straight line so this isn't true.

The angles at B and I are supplementary so:
x - 1 + 2x = 180
3x - 1 = 180
3x = 181
x = 181/3 which is about 60.33

So if x is 60 then x-1 = 59, 2x = 120. x+10 = 70.
Then the exterior angle is 180-59 = 121, exterior angle is 180-70 = 110.

The angle D is 79. The angle C is (x+10) = 70. The angle I = 2x = 120. The angle at B = x-1 = 59.
We have x-1 + 2x = 180, then 3x = 181 and x=60.33.

Suppose we assume lines ED and IG are parallel. Then we can use the angles inside the transversal shape EDCIB.
We have the values of 79, x+10, and 2x and x-1. So the shape has interior angle sums equal to 180*(n-2). We know the shape has 5 vertices so its 180*3 = 540.
The other two angles must also have known values. So we have x-1, 79, x+10, 2x, the sum of the remaining angles must be equal to 540 - (79 + x-1 + x+10 + 2x).

It appears as if the lines BF and CI are parallel. Thus, angle DBI + angle BIC = 180. (x-1) + 2x = 180. 3x = 181 and x = 60.3. This value is not listed.

However, notice that ED and BF are on a line. This means that angles EDB and DBF sum to 180, giving (x-1)+79 = 180. So x = 102.
Next consider the angles C and I. CI and GI are also on a line, so they are supplementary so we get x+10+2x = 180 or 3x+10 = 180 so x = 170/3 = 56.

From the lines being drawn BF and CI can be taken as being parallel. This gives the following:
(x-1)+2x = 180
3x = 181
x=181/3. From the given choices, A, B, and C are integers but D is not. This gives (60.3 -1)+2(60.3) = 180. (x+10)+(180-79) = 180
The diagram is poorly drawn.
