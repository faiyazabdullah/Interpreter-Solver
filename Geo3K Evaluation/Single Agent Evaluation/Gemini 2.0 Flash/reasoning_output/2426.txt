Let the width of the rectangle with area 8 be $w_1$ and the length be 4.
Let the width of the rectangle with area 32 be $w_2$ and the length be x.
We are given that the area of the first rectangle is 8, so $4w_1 = 8$, which means $w_1 = 2$.
The area of the second rectangle is 32, so $xw_2 = 32$.
Since the rectangles are similar, the ratio of their lengths must be equal to the ratio of their widths. Therefore, $\frac{x}{4} = \frac{w_2}{w_1}$.
Also, the ratio of the areas of similar figures is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.
Thus, $\frac{32}{8} = \left(\frac{x}{4}\right)^2$.
Simplifying, we get $4 = \left(\frac{x}{4}\right)^2$.
Taking the square root of both sides, we have $\sqrt{4} = \frac{x}{4}$, so $2 = \frac{x}{4}$.
Multiplying both sides by 4, we get $x = 8$.
