Given:
\frac{IJ}{XJ} = \frac{HJ}{YJ}
m∠WXJ = 130°
m∠YIZ = 20°

We want to find m∠YIZ.
Since \frac{IJ}{XJ} = \frac{HJ}{YJ}, we can rewrite it as \frac{IJ}{HJ} = \frac{XJ}{YJ}.
∠IJH = ∠XJY (Vertical angles are congruent).
Therefore, by the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) Similarity Theorem, triangle IJH is similar to triangle XJY.
So, △IJH ~ △XJY.
Since △IJH ~ △XJY, ∠JIH = ∠JXY.

Now, m∠WXJ = 130°, so m∠JXY = 180° - 130° = 50°.
Since ∠JIH = ∠JXY, m∠JIH = 50°.
In triangle IYZ, the exterior angle at Z is m∠IZC = 20°.
However, m∠IZC is not useful. The problem states m∠WZC = 20, but there's no Z.

From the picture, it looks like m∠YZI = 20°. I believe there is a typo in the original prompt, and m∠ZYI = 20°
Let's suppose m∠YIZ = θ, then m∠YIZ = 180° - 20° = 160°.

In triangle JHI, we have that m∠JIH = m∠JXY.
Then, m∠JXY = 180° - m∠WXJ = 180° - 130° = 50°.
Also, m∠IZC = 20°. Since ∠XZI is a straight angle, m∠XZI = 180°. Therefore m∠IZJ = 180°- m∠WZC -m∠WXY = 180-150
Let us define ∠ZYI as an exterior angle = 20. Let's call ∠YIZ as α.
Then α = 180-20 = 160
Since the problem asks for m∠YIZ.
m∠JXY = 180 - m∠WXJ = 180 - 130 = 50
Then m∠JIH = 50. Also, since the sum of angles in a triangle = 180, then in triangle JIH, we have that ∠JIH + ∠IJH + ∠HJI = 180
We need information to continue this problem. I realize that WZC is 20
If instead we're meant to derive m∠YIZ from ∠JIH and m∠XZY,

Here X Y Z are on a same line
m∠JXY = 180-130 = 50. Then JIH and JXY must be similar
Then we use the other external angle = 20 = Y Z external which is the external = 20

The angle Z is external to JYX then the angle Z =  20 degrees. then the external of angle at HXY is 130.
The angle XZY=130 or JYX= 180-30
Angle (JIH and JXY)
and HIJ and JXY need some formula where these must equal and also the  side
But we still missing one angle.  Since IJ is opposite YIZ we can know this from the law of sines

Then  since angle GZY= 20. that means HIY = 20

Consider the triangle IYZ m∠YZI =  20, so m∠YIZ needs to be found . since its a straight line m∠XZI needs to add = 180, then the equation is 20+ m∠H =180 -50, and the answer should be 40
