The area of a parallelogram can be calculated using the formula: Area = base × height.

In the given parallelogram, we can consider DC as the base, which is equal to AB, so DC = 21 cm. The corresponding height is AF which is perpendicular to DC. AF can be found by considering the triangle AFC.

Also, we can use the side AC = 17 cm as a base and the corresponding height = 8 cm.

Thus, the area of the parallelogram is base × height = 21 x h = 17 × 8
area = 17 * 8 = 136

Area = base x height
Area = 21 x h = 17 x 8
Area = 136 cm^2

However, we are also given that AB = 21 cm and AC = 17 cm, and the perpendicular distance from A to the line DC is given as 8 cm. We can then find the area using the formula:
Area = base × height
Area = 21 × h

Since AF is perpendicular to DC, it forms the height of the parallelogram when considering the base as DC (which is equal to 21 cm) or AB (which is equal to 21 cm). The perpendicular distance from A to DC (the height) is unknown (denoted as h).

Instead, consider the side AC as a base, AC = 17 cm. The corresponding height is equal to 8 cm.

Then, the area of the parallelogram = 17 × 8 = 136 cm².

Using base AB, Area = 21 * height
Using base AC, Area = 17 * 8 = 136

The area is 136. We calculate height from A perpendicular to CD.
Let this height be H.
So 21 * H = 17 * 8
21 * H = 136
H = 136/21 = 6.47

It looks like I made an error in interpreting the diagram. The 8cm is the height to the base AC=17cm. The area = 17cm * 8cm = 136 sq cm.
However, no such answer choice is given.

Rethinking. Let AB be the base, so AB = 21 cm. The corresponding height is unknown.  Let the height be 'h'.
Also, AD = 17. Then the area of the parallelogram is 21h.  Also the height is 8, using the base AC.  So, 17 * 8 = 136.  Area is 136. None of the answers match.

Let us approximate the answer. I see 21 and 17 and 8.  If we multiply 21 times 17, we get 357.
