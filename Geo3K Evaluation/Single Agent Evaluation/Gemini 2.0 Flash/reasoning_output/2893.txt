We are given a right triangle PQR, where angle R is the right angle. The sides are PR = 8, QR = 15, and PQ = 17.
We are asked to find the value of cos P to the nearest hundredth.

In a right triangle, the cosine of an angle is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. In this case, we want to find cos P, so we need to find the length of the side adjacent to angle P and the length of the hypotenuse.
The side adjacent to angle P is PR, which has a length of 8.
The hypotenuse is PQ, which has a length of 17.
Therefore, cos P = adjacent / hypotenuse = PR / PQ = 8 / 17.

Now, we need to convert the fraction 8/17 to a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.
8 ÷ 17 ≈ 0.470588...
Rounding to the nearest hundredth, we get 0.47.
