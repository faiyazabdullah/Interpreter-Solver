Let's analyze the given geometric figure. We are given that AY = 5, YB = 14 - 5 = 9, and YN = y. Also, we are given that AN = x and AB = z. Since the line from A to N is perpendicular to YB, triangle AYB is similar to triangle ANB. Therefore, the ratios of their corresponding sides are equal.

So we have:
YN/AY = AB/YB.
That gives us: y/5 = z/9, which implies z = (9y)/5

Next, since triangles AYB and ANB are similar, we also have:
AN/AY = AB/YB
x/5 = z/9, so x = (5z)/9.

Now consider triangle AYB. We have AY = 5, YB = 14-5 = 9, and we know that y + 5 = 14, so y = 14 - 5 = 9. Then the length of YB is incorrect since it is given by 14 -5 = 9. It is given on the image as y, such that AY+YN = 14 which implies that YN=14-5=9, giving y=14-5=9.

From the similarity relation we had, y/5 = z/9 implies that 9/5 = z/9 so z = (9*9)/5 = 81/5 which is not any of the choices.

Let us consider triangles AYB and ANB.
We have angle A in triangle AYB is same as the angle A in the triangle ANB.
Also AY = 5 and the distance from point Y to line NB is 14. YN is unknown and given as y.
In triangle AYB, let's suppose that the two small triangles, AYN and ANB, are similar. This means that angle YAB = angle BAN, and angle AYB = angle ANB. Then angle YBA = angle ABN. However, AN is perpendicular to the line from Y to B, so the angle ANB is a right angle, and also angle A is a right angle (according to the square shown between the lines AY and AB).

Let's assume AYB is a right angle triangle, with YA = 5, and YB= 14. Using Pythagoras' theorem we have
YB^2 = YA^2 + AB^2, so
14^2 = 5^2 + AB^2
196 = 25 + AB^2
AB^2 = 196 - 25 = 171
AB = sqrt(171) = sqrt(9 * 19) = 3 sqrt(19)
Therefore, z = AB = 3 sqrt(19).
