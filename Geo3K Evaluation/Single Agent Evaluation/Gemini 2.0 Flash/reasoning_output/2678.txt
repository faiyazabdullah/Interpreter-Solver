FH is a diameter because it passes through the center A.
Angle FHJ is inscribed in a semicircle, therefore angle FHJ = 90 degrees.
Thus, triangle FHJ is a right triangle with the right angle at H.
Angles 1 and 3 are complementary angles, meaning m∠1 + m∠3 = 90 degrees.
It is given that m∠2 = 2x and m∠3 = x.
Angle GHJ is a right angle because it is inscribed in the semicircle.
Thus, m∠1 + m∠3 = 90.
Also, angle GHJ is the sum of angles 1 and 3.
We are also given that the angle at H is a right angle. Thus, m∠1 = 90.
This implies that quadrilateral GBJH is cyclic.
In triangle GHJ, we have m∠GHJ = 90, m∠2 = 2x, m∠3 = x.
Since m∠1 + m∠3 = 90, m∠1 = 90 - m∠3 = 90 - x.
Since m∠1 + m∠2 = m∠GHJ = 90, then (90-x) + 2x = 90.
90 + x = 90, thus x = 0.
This is not possible.
The inscribed angle FHJ subtends a diameter. So m∠FHJ = 90.
Then in right triangle FHJ, m∠FJH + m∠HFJ = 90.
Thus m∠3 + m∠1 = 90, or x + m∠1 = 90.
Similarly, angle GHJ is a right angle so m∠2 + m∠1 = 90.
We are given m∠2 = 2x and m∠3 = x.
So x + m∠1 = 90 and 2x + m∠1 = 90.
Then x = 2x implies x = 0, which cannot be true.
Since H is at right angle it suggests that m∠GHJ=90
It is given that m∠2 = 2x and m∠3 = x.
Since FH is a diameter, then m∠FHJ = 90.
Since GHJ is inscribed in the semi-circle it follows that m∠GHJ = 90.
We know that m∠2 + m∠1 = m∠GHJ = 90.
And m∠3 + m∠1 = m∠FHJ = 90.
From this, we have
2x + m∠1 = 90
x + m∠1 = 90
Subtracting, we get x = 0, which isn't possible.
However, m∠GHJ = 90, and m∠GJH = x, and m∠2 = 2x
Since FH is diameter m∠FHJ = 90. This gives that m∠1+m∠3=90.
Also m∠1+m∠2=90. This means m∠2=m∠3. In this case x=2x so x=0.
GHJ is a right triangle because it is inscribed in a semicircle. Therefore, m∠GHJ = 90.
So m∠2 + m∠1 = 90. Also m∠3 + m∠1 = 90
Since m∠2 = 2x and m∠3 = x, then 2x + m∠1 = 90 and x + m∠1 = 90.
Subtracting the two equations, we get x = 0. Not possible.
If we assume that GJ is a diameter:
Angle GJH should be 90 then 2x+x+angle JGH =180 or 3x + angle JGH =180
Since angle GHJ is 90 then 2x+angle 1=90. 3x=90 so x=30.

If m∠3=x then x+m∠1=90. Also 2x+m∠1=90. So 3x+2m∠1=180
This contradicts the triangle condition.
If the whole angle at H =90 then 2x+x=45, 3x=45 , but 45 is not one the options.

Since the angle at H is a right angle, and the two angles on the right are equal, the right angle must be divided into two 45 degree angles. Then x = 45
Since x+2x=90. This gives that x=30. So then 2x=60. So then m∠2 = 60
