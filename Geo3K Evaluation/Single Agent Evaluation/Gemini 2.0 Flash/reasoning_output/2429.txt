The image shows a parallelogram.
The length of side CD is 14 mm.
The length of side DE is 7 mm.
The angle at D is 60 degrees.
We need to find the area of the parallelogram.
The area of a parallelogram is base times height.
The base is AD = BC = 14 mm.
To find the height BE, we can use the triangle BDE.
In triangle BDE, angle BDE = 60 degrees.
DE = 7 mm.
sin(60) = BE/BD is not useful since BD is unknown.
Instead, consider the base as AD. The height is BE.
In triangle BDE, sin(60) = BE/BD, so BE = BD * sin(60).
However, we know AE = 7 mm, so AD = AE + ED
Consider the right triangle formed by the altitude from B to AD, which is BE.
sin(60) = BE / BD
So, BE = BD * sin(60)
However, we don't know the length of BD.
Alternatively, we can say the area of the parallelogram is base * height.
Base = AD = 14 mm
We drop a perpendicular from B to AD, and call the foot of the perpendicular E.
Then triangle BDE is a right triangle. Angle BDE is 60 degrees. DE = 7 mm.
So, in triangle BDE,
cos(60) = DE / BD
cos(60) = 7 / BD
1/2 = 7 / BD
BD = 14 mm
Then sin(60) = BE / BD
sin(60) = BE / 14
BE = 14 * sin(60)
BE = 14 * (sqrt(3)/2)
BE = 7 * sqrt(3) mm
Area of parallelogram = AD * BE
Area = 14 * 7 * sqrt(3)
Area = 98 * sqrt(3)
Area ≈ 98 * 1.732
Area ≈ 169.736
Area ≈ 169.7 mm^2
