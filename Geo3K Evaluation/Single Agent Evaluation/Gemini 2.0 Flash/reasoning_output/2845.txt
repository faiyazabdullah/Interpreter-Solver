Given that m \angle 1 = 58 and m \angle 2 = 47. Since AB is parallel to CE, then \angle 5 = \angle 2 = 47 (alternate interior angles are equal). Also, \angle 6 = \angle 1 = 58 (corresponding angles are equal).

The angles in triangle BCE add up to 180 degrees.
So, \angle 3 + \angle 5 + \angle 6 + \angle 7 = 180
26 + 47 + \angle 7 = 180, where \angle 7 and \angle 6 is a linear pair so \angle 6 + \angle 7 = 180.
Thus, \angle 7 = 180 - (\angle 5 + \angle 3)= 180 - (47 + 26) = 180 - 73 = 107.
Also \angle 5 + \angle 6 + \angle 3 = 47 + 58 + 26 is not equal to 180. This means that \angle 6 is not 58 degrees.

Since AB is parallel to CE, we have that \angle 1 = \angle 6. However, \angle 1 and \angle 6 are not alternate interior or corresponding angles. Let's reconsider the given information.

We know m\angle 1 = 58 and m\angle 2 = 47. Also, AB || CE, so \angle 5 = \angle 2 = 47^\circ (alternate interior angles).

In triangle BCE, m\angle 2 + m\angle 3 + m\angle BCE = 180^\circ, where m\angle BCE = m\angle 4 + m\angle 8.
Therefore, 47 + 26 + m\angle BCE = 180^\circ, so m\angle BCE = 180 - 47 - 26 = 107^\circ.

Since \angle 8 and \angle 4 form \angle BCE, let's consider triangle CDE.
m\angle 7 + m\angle 5 = 180 - m\angle ACE = 180 - 107 = 73, so \angle ACE is actually the supplementary angle.
Since AB is parallel to CE, \angle 1 and \angle 6 are corresponding angles, but they are not.
\angle 5 = \angle 2 = 47. \angle 3 = 26.  Then \angle 7 = 180 - (47 +26) = 107, since exterior angle to \angle 7 equals the sum of \angle 2 and \angle 3.
In triangle CDE, we have angles \angle 7, \angle 8, and \angle 9. m\angle 7 = 107.
So we know that m\angle BCE = 107. Let us assume that m\angle 4 is 60.
Then \angle 8 = \angle 1 is also likely.
So 7+8+9 = 180. \angle 8 = \angle 1 = 58.
m\angle 9 = 180 - (107) - 58
\angle 4 = 107 - something.
In \triangle CDE, the angles sum to 180 degrees. \angle E = 180 - \angle 3 - \angle 2 = 180 - 26 - 47 = 107 degrees.
\angle CED = \angle 5
\angle DCE + \angle DEC + \angle EDC = 180 degrees.
\angle EDC = 180 - 107 -58 =

Since AB || CE, \angle BAC = \angle AEC. Thus 58 = \angle AEC. In triangle BCE, \angle BCE = 180 - (47 + 26) = 107 degrees. \angle 5 + \angle 7 is 180 because AB || CE.

Also, we have $\angle ACE = \angle 4+ \angle 8 = 180^\circ - 47^\circ -26^\circ = 107^\circ$.
In $\triangle CDE$, \angle 7 + \angle 8 + \angle 9 = 180
\angle 7 = 180 - (\angle 2+\angle 3) = 180-(47+26) = 107
\angle A = \angle 8.
$\angle AEC = \angle E = m \angle ACE$, Thus \angle ACE = A

\angle 8  = (58)
\angle 9 =
