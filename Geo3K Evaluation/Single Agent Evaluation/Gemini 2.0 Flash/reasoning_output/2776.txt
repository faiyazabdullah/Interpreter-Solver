GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Since ABCD is a rectangle, we know that all its angles are 90 degrees. In particular, angle DAB is 90 degrees. We are given that m∠2 = 40 degrees. Since ∠2 and ∠1 make up the 90-degree angle DAB, we have m∠1 = 90 - 40 = 50 degrees.
The diagonals of a rectangle are congruent and bisect each other. Thus, AE = CE = BE = DE. Therefore, triangle ABE is an isosceles triangle with AE = BE.
In an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal. Thus, m∠2 = m∠6 = 40 degrees.
Also, triangle AEB has angles ∠2, ∠6, and ∠5. Thus m∠5 = 180 - m∠2 - m∠6 = 180 - 40 - 40 = 100 degrees.
Angles ∠5 and ∠8 are vertical angles, so they are congruent. Therefore, m∠8 = m∠5 = 100 degrees.

Final Answer: D
