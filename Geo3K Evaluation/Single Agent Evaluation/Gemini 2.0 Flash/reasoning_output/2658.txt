Let $EF = 12$ and $ED = 16$.
Since $ED$ and $EF$ are secants to the circle from the same point $E$, we can use the secant-secant theorem:
$ED \cdot EB = EF \cdot EA$, where $EB$ and $EA$ are the external segments of the secants.
Let the radius of the circle be $r$.
$EB = ED - BD$ and $EA = EF + FA$.
Also, $BD$ and $FA$ are chords. Since $BD$ and $FA$ are tangent to the circle at points $B$ and $F$ respectively, we have that $GB = GF = r$.
Let $x = FG$. Thus, the radius of the circle is $x$, so $BG = x$.
$ED = 16$.
Let $BD = d$ and $AF = a$.
We are given that $EF = 12$ and $FG = x$.
$ED \cdot EB = EF \cdot EA$.
$16(16 - BD) = 12(12 + FG)$
$16(16 - 2x) = 12(12 + 2x)$
$256 - 32x = 144 + 24x$
$256 - 144 = 24x + 32x$
$112 = 56x$
$x = \frac{112}{56} = 2$

However, this reasoning is not correct. Let $E$ be a point outside a circle. Let $EF$ and $ED$ be secant segments from $E$ to the circle, intersecting the circle at $F$ and $D$ respectively. Then $EF \cdot EA = ED \cdot EB$, where $EA$ and $EB$ are the entire lengths of the secants from $E$. We are given $EF = 12$ and $ED = 16$. Also, we have $FG = x$. Therefore, $EA = EF + FA = 12 + x$ (since $FG$ is a radius and $FA$ looks like radius so assume that F is where the secant segment passes). We want to find $x$.
Since $G$ is the center of the circle, $GD = x$. Thus, $BD = 2x$ (approx.). Then $EB = ED - DB = 16 - 2x$

By the secant theorem:
$EA \cdot EF = EB \cdot ED$
$(12 + x) \cdot 12 = (16 - x) \cdot 16$
$144 + 12x = 256 - 16x$
$28x = 112$
$x = 4$
I do not see $4$ as an option.

Since segments that appear tangent, are tangent, $ED$ and $EF$ are tangent.
Let the circle intersect the segment ED at D and intersect the segment EF at F.
From external point E, the segments ED and EF are drawn tangent to the circle.
$ED = 16$ and $EF = 12$. This is impossible.

Let the center of the circle be G, where radius is x.
$EF = 12$, $ED = 16$
Then $EA = EF + r = EF + FG = 12 + x$.
And $EB = ED - r = ED - DB = 16- x$ (DB is also r).

If $EF$ and $ED$ are both tangents to the circle, it would mean that the lengths are equal, but $EF=12$ and $ED=16$.

In general, it is difficult to ascertain any further relation. I am unsure as to the precise geometry.
