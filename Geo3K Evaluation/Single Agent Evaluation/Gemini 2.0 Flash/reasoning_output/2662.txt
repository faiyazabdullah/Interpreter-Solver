The measure of arc IH is 59 degrees. Since IJ is a radius perpendicular to LJ, angle ILJ is 90 degrees.
Therefore, the measure of arc IJ is 90 degrees.
The measure of arc IHJ is the sum of the measures of arc IH and arc IJ.
m(arc IHJ) = m(arc IH) + m(arc IJ) = 59 + 90 = 149 degrees.

Since 149 is not an answer choice, let's find the central angle corresponding to the requested arc.
The problem asks for the measure of arc IHJ.
We are given that m(angle ILH) = 59 degrees.
Since IG is a diameter, m(angle ILG) = 180 degrees.
Since LJ is perpendicular to IG, m(angle ILJ) = 90 degrees.
m(arc IH) = m(angle ILH) = 59 degrees.
m(arc IJ) = m(angle ILJ) = 90 degrees.
m(arc IHJ) = m(arc IH) + m(arc IJ) = 59 + 90 = 149 degrees.
This result doesn't match any of the provided answer choices.
Let's recalculate.
m(arc IH) = 59 degrees
m(arc GJ) = 90 degrees
m(arc IG) = 180 degrees
m(arc IHJ) = 360 - m(arc HG) - m(arc GJ)
Since IG is a diameter, angle ILG is a straight angle.
Since m(angle ILH) = 59, m(angle HLG) = 180 - 59 = 121.
Therefore m(arc HG) = 121.
Then m(arc IHJ) = 360 - 121 - 90 = 360 - 211 = 149.

Since I G is a diameter, m \widehat I G = 180.
Since H K is a diameter, m \widehat H K = 180.
Given m \widehat I H = 59 degrees.
We want to find m \widehat I H J.
Since L J is perpendicular to I G, m \angle I L J = 90 degrees. Thus m \widehat I J = 90 degrees.
Then m \widehat I H J = m \widehat I H + m \widehat H J = m \widehat I H + m \widehat I J - m \widehat I H = 90 + 59 = 149
This still doesn't match any answer choice.

Let's check arc HJ = arc IJ - arc IH.
Since angle ILJ is 90, then the arc IJ is 90 degrees.
m arc IHJ = m arc IH + m arc IJ. arc IH is 59, and arc IJ is 90. Thus m arc IHJ is 149.
However, we can also calculate m arc IHJ = 360 - m arc JGI - m arc HI

Another possible meaning:
Arc IHJ could also refer to the arc from I counterclockwise to H, then counterclockwise to J.
Then m \widehat I H J = 360 - m \widehat I J = 360 - 90 = 270.
