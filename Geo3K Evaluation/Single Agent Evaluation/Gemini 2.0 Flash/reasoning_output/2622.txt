GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The large figure has a height of 8 yards and an area of 36 square yards. The small figure has a height of 4 yards. The two figures are similar.
The ratio of the heights is 8/4 = 2.
Since the figures are similar, the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding lengths. So the ratio of the areas is 2^2 = 4.
The area of the large figure is 36 square yards. The area of the small figure is A.
The ratio of the areas is 36/A = 4.
So A = 36/4 = 9.
Therefore, the area of the green figure is 9 square yards.

Final Answer: A
