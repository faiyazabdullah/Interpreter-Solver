From the given information, we have UJ = 9 and VJ = 3. Since the segments SJ, UJ, ZJ, and the points Y, V, and T are midpoints of the sides SZ, ZU, and SU respectively, we know that the triangles are similar.

The triangle SUV is similar to triangle ZJU. We have the ratio of the sides as UJ/UJ = 9/3 = 3. So, ZU = 2*UJ = 2*9 = 18. Also, ZV = 2*VJ = 2*3 = 6.

We are given ZT = 18. Since ST = UT, the figure is an isosceles triangle. We also know that SY = YZ, ST = TU, and ZV = VU.
Also, SJ = (1/2)ZU. So, SJ = (1/2)* ZU.
ZJ = (1/2)SU. So, ZJ = (1/2)SU.
UJ = (1/2)SZ. So, UJ = (1/2)SZ.
Since UJ = 9, SZ = 2*9 = 18.
Since VJ = 3, SU = 2*ZJ.
The ratio of similarity between the large and small triangles is 2:1.

Consider the triangle STU. Since T is the midpoint of SU, ST = TU. Similarly, in triangle SZU, Y is the midpoint of SZ and V is the midpoint of ZU.
Then, YV = (1/2)*SU = JT + JU. Also, UT = US. SV is the median of the triangle.

Since Y, V, and T are the midpoints of SZ, ZU, and SU, YV = (1/2)SU, YT = (1/2)ZU and VT = (1/2)SZ.

Given that UJ = 9, VJ = 3, and ZT = 18.
Since V is the midpoint of ZU, then ZV = VU. Since J is on ZU, ZV = VJ + ZJ. Also, UJ = UJ + ZJ. Thus, VU = VJ = 3. And ZU = 2*ZV = 2*3 = 6.

Since ZT = 18, we are given ZT = 18. We know that VJ = 3 and UJ = 9. The points Y, V and T are midpoints. Therefore, SV = YV+YJ. Since YV = (1/2)SU.

We want to find SV. We know that VT = (1/2)SZ = UJ = 9. ZV = 3.
SV is a median.

ZV=3, JU=9. ZJ=3
Since SV = 6. Then SZ=2*UJ = 2*9 =18
SV = ZT. So SV =6.
