The polygon is a regular hexagon.
The distance from the center to a vertex is the same as the side length.
The perpendicular bisector of the side is shown as 3m.
The hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles.
The equilateral triangle can be divided into two 30-60-90 triangles.
The short leg of the 30-60-90 triangle is 3m.
The long leg is $3\sqrt{3}$m.
Therefore, the side length of the equilateral triangle (and the hexagon) is $2*3\sqrt{3}/3 = 2\sqrt{3}$.
The side length of the hexagon is equal to $\frac{3}{\cos 30} = \frac{3}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \frac{6}{\sqrt{3}} = 2\sqrt{3}$.
Area of equilateral triangle is $\frac{1}{2}* 2\sqrt{3}*3 = 3\sqrt{3}$.
Area of hexagon is $6 * 3\sqrt{3} = 18\sqrt{3} \approx 31.1769$.
Area of a regular hexagon is $A = \frac{3\sqrt{3}s^2}{2} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}(2\sqrt{3})^2}{2} = \frac{3\sqrt{3} * 12}{2} = 18\sqrt{3} \approx 31.1769$.

The problem shows that the distance from the center to the midpoint of the side is 3m.
The side length can be found with tan(30) = x/3, so x = 3*tan(30) = 3 * sqrt(3)/3 = sqrt(3).
So, the side length is 2*sqrt(3).
Area is (3*sqrt(3)/2) * (2*sqrt(3))^2 = (3*sqrt(3)/2) * 12 = 18*sqrt(3) which is approximately 31.2.
This does not match any of the answer choices.

The area of a regular polygon is given by the formula A = (1/2) * apothem * perimeter
In this case the apothem is 3.
We have the hexagon is made up of 6 equilateral triangles. The height of each of these triangles is 3. The side length is s. We have a right triangle such that s/2 and 3 are the sides.
$\tan 30 = \frac{s/2}{3}$. Therefore, $s/2 = 3 * \tan 30 = 3 * \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$.
So $s = \frac{6}{\sqrt{3}} = 2\sqrt{3}$.
Perimeter = $6 * 2\sqrt{3} = 12\sqrt{3}$
Area = 0.5 * 3 * $12\sqrt{3} = 18\sqrt{3} \approx 31.1769$.

However, if the distance from the center to a vertex were 3, then the area would be $6 * \frac{3^2 \sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{54\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{27\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 23.38$
