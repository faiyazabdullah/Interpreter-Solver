Since XY and XZ are midsegments of triangle RST, Y and Z are midpoints of RT and ST respectively. Also, XY = 1/2 * ST and XZ = 1/2 * RT.

Given that RY + YT = RT and RY = 7 and RT = 13. Since Y is the midpoint of RT, then RY = YT = 7 and RT = RY + YT = 7+7 = 14. Thus, RY is not 7 and RT is 13.
Since XY is a midsegment, XY = 1/2 * ST. Also XZ is a midsegment, XZ = 1/2 * RT.
RY + YT = RT. RY = 7 and RT = 13. So, 7 + YT = 13 or YT = 13-7 = 6.
Since Y is the midpoint of RT, RY = YT. However, RY = 7 and YT = 6, which contradicts the definition of a midsegment.
If Y is a midpoint of RT, then RY = YT = 1/2 * RT. Given RT = 13, RY = YT = 13/2 = 6.5. RY = 7, which is given. So there is a mistake in the assumptions.

XY and XZ are midsegments of triangle RST, so Y and Z are midpoints of RT and ST, respectively.
Since XY is a midsegment, XY = 1/2 ST. Also since XZ is a midsegment, XZ = 1/2 RT.
We are given RT = 13.
The length of RT is 13, and Y is the midpoint of RT, so RY = YT = 13/2 = 6.5.
Since XZ is a midsegment, XZ = 1/2 RT = 1/2 (13) = 6.5.
Since Y is the midpoint of RT, then RT = 2RY = 2YT = 13.
Since XZ is parallel to RT, the angle SXZ is supplementary to angle SRY. Also, XYZT is a parallelogram, so the angle SXZ is supplementary to the angle RXY.
Since XY is a midsegment, ST = 2 * XY
Since XZ is a midsegment, RT = 2 * XZ
We are given that RT = 13, so 2 * XZ = 13 and XZ = 6.5.
ST = 2 * XY
Since XY || ST and XZ || RT, and we know that XY = ST/2.
Since XZ || RT, angles SZX and SRT are corresponding angles, so SZX = SRT.
Since RT = 13, and Z is the midpoint of ST, ST = 2ZT.
Since XY and XZ are midsegments of triangle RST, XY || ST and XZ || RT.
Thus, RXYZ is a parallelogram, so XY = RZ and XZ = RY.
Since RY = 7, then XZ = 7. But we also know that XZ = 1/2 RT = 1/2 (13) = 6.5.
Thus the statement that XY and XZ are midsegments is incorrect.
Since XZ is a midsegment, XZ = 1/2 RT. So RT = 2 XZ.
Since XY is a midsegment, XY = 1/2 ST. So ST = 2 XY.
We are given RT = 13, so ST = 2 XY
But since XZ is a midsegment, RY = 1/2 RT = 7/13.

The question indicates XY and XZ are midsegments, so Y and Z are the midpoints of RT and ST, respectively. Therefore, XY = 1/2 * ST. Also, RT = 13, so if Z is the midpoint of ST, then ST = 2 * ZT. Since XY is a midsegment, it should be half the length of ST. RT = 13, so XY = 1/2 * ST, so ST = 2 * XY. We are given that RT = 13, and we need to find ST.
