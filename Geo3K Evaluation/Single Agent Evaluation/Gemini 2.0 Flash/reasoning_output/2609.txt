Since $ML \perp FG$, then $FL = LG = 24$, so $FG = FL + LG = 24 + 24 = 48$. Also, since $MN \perp HJ$, then $HN = NJ$. Given $HJ = 48$, then $HN = NJ = \frac{48}{2} = 24$. Thus, $FG = HJ = 48$.
Since the lengths of the chords are equal, the measures of their corresponding arcs are equal. Thus, $\widehat{FG} = \widehat{HJ}$.
We are given $m\widehat{HP} = 65$. Since we don't know $m\widehat{PJ}$, we cannot use it directly.
However, we know that $\widehat{HJ} = \widehat{FG}$, so we must determine what other relationship is available.
Since $HJ = 48$, it suggests there is some relationship. Also, given $\widehat{HP} = 65$, we are looking for $\widehat{HJ}$, where $\widehat{HJ} = \widehat{HN} + \widehat{NJ}$.
Let $\widehat{HJ} = x$. Then $\widehat{FG} = x$. We are given $m\widehat{HP} = 65$.
However, there is no apparent relation between these. We need to relate the chords to the arcs.
If we are looking for the arc measure of $\widehat{HJ}$, since $MN \perp HJ$, then $HN = NJ$. Thus $\widehat{HN} = \widehat{NJ}$, and $\widehat{HJ} = 2\widehat{HN}$.
Also since $FL=LG$ and $HN=NJ$, $ML$ and $MN$ bisect $FG$ and $HJ$ respectively.
It looks like we are intended to say that since the lengths of the chords are equal, the corresponding arcs are equal. But, we don't have any further information.
There is no immediately apparent way to relate $\widehat{HP} = 65$ to $\widehat{HJ}$ with the information given.
It seems we can assume that the information that $FL = 24$ and $HJ = 48$ are somehow not useful, and so there must be a simple answer.
Given $m\widehat{HP} = 65$, we might consider if $m\widehat{HJ} = 2m\widehat{HP} = 130$.
