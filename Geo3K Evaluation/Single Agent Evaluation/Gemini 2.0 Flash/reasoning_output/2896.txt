The figure is a parallelogram JKLM. In a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. This means that the sum of two consecutive angles is 180 degrees. Angle K is 109 degrees. Angle L is consecutive to angle K. So, angle L + angle K = 180.
m \angle L + 109 = 180
m \angle L = 180 - 109
m \angle L = 71 degrees.
In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. m \angle JML is opposite to m \angle JKL. So, m \angle JML = m \angle JKL. However, since the adjacent angles are supplementary, m \angle M = m \angle K = 109 means the angles are not congruent.
m \angle L = 71 degrees. Also, in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, so m \angle J = m \angle L = 71 degrees. In the parallelogram JKLM, adjacent angles are supplementary, so m \angle K + m \angle L = 180, and m \angle M + m \angle L = 180. m \angle JML is the same as m \angle M.
Since m \angle K = 109, m \angle M = 109, therefore m \angle M = 71. Since consecutive angles are supplementary and angles K and L are consecutive, we can write: m \angle K + m \angle L = 180, m \angle L = 180 - m \angle K = 180 - 109 = 71. So the measure of angle JML is 71.
