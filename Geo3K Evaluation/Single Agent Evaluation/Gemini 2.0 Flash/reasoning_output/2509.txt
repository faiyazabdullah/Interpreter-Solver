GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
From the figure, we can see that \angle 1 and \angle 7 are vertical angles. Therefore, m \angle 7 = m \angle 1 = 123^\circ.
Also, \angle 7 and \angle 10 are corresponding angles, meaning the two lines intersected by a transversal are parallel. Similarly, the line through U and K is parallel to the line through O and A.
Also, \angle 10 and \angle 15 are vertical angles. Therefore, m \angle 15 = m \angle 10.
Because the lines are parallel, \angle 10 and \angle 13 are consecutive interior angles, and hence supplementary. Therefore, m \angle 10 + m \angle 13 = 180^\circ.
Also, \angle 13 and \angle 14 are vertical angles. Therefore, m \angle 14 = m \angle 13.
Since m \angle 1 = 123^\circ = m \angle 7, we can say that m \angle 2 = 180^\circ - 123^\circ = 57^\circ.
Also, m \angle 8 = 57^\circ because \angle 8 and \angle 2 are vertical angles.
Since m \angle 7 = 123^\circ, we know that \angle 10 is supplementary to \angle 7, so m \angle 10 = 180^\circ - 123^\circ = 57^\circ.
Thus, m \angle 15 = m \angle 10 = 57^\circ.
Since \angle 13 and \angle 10 are supplementary angles, we have m \angle 13 = 180^\circ - 57^\circ = 123^\circ.
Thus, m \angle 14 = m \angle 13 = 57^\circ.
