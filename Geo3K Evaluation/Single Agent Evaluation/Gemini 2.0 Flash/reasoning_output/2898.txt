QUESTION:
Find the area of the figure to the nearest tenth.

CHOICES:
A. 24
B. 31.1
C. 38.1
D. 52.3

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The figure is a rectangle with two semicircles attached to each of the shorter sides. The height of the rectangle is 3, and the length is 8.
The radius of each semicircle is half the height of the rectangle, so the radius is 3/2 = 1.5.
The area of the rectangle is length times height, which is 8 * 3 = 24.
The two semicircles together make a full circle. The area of a circle is πr^2.
Area of the circle = π * (1.5)^2 = π * 2.25 ≈ 7.06858
The area of the whole figure is the area of the rectangle plus the area of the circle, which is approximately 24 + 7.06858 = 31.06858.
Rounding to the nearest tenth, the area is 31.1.
