QUESTION:
A square is inscribed in a circle of area 18 \pi square units. Find the length of a side of the square.

CHOICES:
A. 3
B. 3 \sqrt 2
C. 6
D. 6 \sqrt 2

The area of the circle is given as $18\pi$ square units. The formula for the area of a circle is $A = \pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle.
So, $\pi r^2 = 18\pi$. Dividing both sides by $\pi$, we get $r^2 = 18$, which means $r = \sqrt{18} = \sqrt{9 \cdot 2} = 3\sqrt{2}$.

Let the side length of the inscribed square be $s$. The diagonal of the square is $s\sqrt{2}$. The diagonal of the square is also the diameter of the circle, which is $2r = 2(3\sqrt{2}) = 6\sqrt{2}$.
Therefore, $s\sqrt{2} = 6\sqrt{2}$. Dividing both sides by $\sqrt{2}$, we get $s = 6$.

The length of a side of the square is 6.
