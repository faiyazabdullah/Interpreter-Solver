QUESTION:
Find the area of the shaded region. Round to the nearest tenth.

CHOICES:
A. 104.7
B. 157.1
C. 235.6
D. 314.2

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The figure shows a large circle with diameter 20. Thus, the radius of the large circle is 10.
There are two smaller circles inside the large circle. The diameter of each of the smaller circles is half the diameter of the larger circle, so their diameter is 10. This means their radius is 5.
The area of the large circle is πr^2 = π(10^2) = 100π.
The area of each of the smaller circles is πr^2 = π(5^2) = 25π.
Since there are two smaller circles, their combined area is 2 * 25π = 50π.
The area of the shaded region is the area of the large circle minus the area of the two smaller circles.
Area of shaded region = 100π - 50π = 50π.
Now we need to approximate this value. Using π ≈ 3.14159, we have 50π ≈ 50 * 3.14159 = 157.0795 ≈ 157.1.

The area of the shaded region is approximately 157.1.
Comparing this result with the answer choices, we see that choice B is the closest.
