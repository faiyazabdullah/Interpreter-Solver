Let the measure of the arc KH be y.
The angle ∠GLH is an exterior angle to the triangle GLK, and its measure is 110°.
Arc KJ has measure 97°, so ∠KGJ = 97°/2 = 48.5°
Arc GJ has measure x°. The inscribed angle ∠GKJ subtends arc GJ, so ∠GKJ = x/2.
We are given that the angle ∠KLG is 110 degrees. Angle ∠KLG and ∠KLJ are supplementary, so ∠KLJ = 180° - 110° = 70°.
The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
∠KHJ = x/2.
∠HKJ = 97/2 = 48.5.
Since ∠KLJ is an angle formed by intersecting chords, its measure is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. Thus,
∠KLJ = (arc KJ + arc GH)/2
70 = (97 + y)/2
140 = 97 + y
y = 140 - 97 = 43

Since ∠GLH is an exterior angle to triangle GLK, we have ∠GLH = ∠LKG + ∠LGK.
Thus, 110 = x/2 + 48.5
x/2 = 110 - 48.5 = 61.5
x = 2 * 61.5 = 123.
