QUESTION:
Find x for the equilateral triangle R S T if R S = x + 9, S T = 2 x, and R T = 3 x - 9.

CHOICES:
A. 3
B. 6
C. 9
D. 12

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

Since triangle RST is an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal in length. Therefore, we can set up equations using the given side lengths.

We have RS = x + 9, ST = 2x, and RT = 3x - 9.

We can set RS = ST, which gives us x + 9 = 2x.
Subtracting x from both sides, we get 9 = x.

We can also set ST = RT, which gives us 2x = 3x - 9.
Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get 0 = x - 9.
Adding 9 to both sides, we get x = 9.

We can also set RS = RT, which gives us x + 9 = 3x - 9.
Subtracting x from both sides, we get 9 = 2x - 9.
Adding 9 to both sides, we get 18 = 2x.
Dividing by 2, we get x = 9.

In all three cases, we find that x = 9.

Now, we can check the side lengths:
RS = x + 9 = 9 + 9 = 18
ST = 2x = 2 * 9 = 18
RT = 3x - 9 = 3 * 9 - 9 = 27 - 9 = 18

Since all side lengths are equal, the triangle is indeed equilateral, and our value for x is correct.
