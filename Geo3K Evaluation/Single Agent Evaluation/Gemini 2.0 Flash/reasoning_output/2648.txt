From the diagram, we know that angle DAC is 67 degrees, and angle DAF is a right angle, which means it is 90 degrees. Also, line segment BAE is a straight line. Therefore, the angle BAF is x degrees.
We can find the measure of angle BAF (x) by using the fact that angle DAF is 90 degrees.
Angle DAF + angle BAF + angle DAC = 180 degrees. However, angle DAC is adjacent to angle DAF.
Angles DAF and FAC add up to the angle DAC
Also, the angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees
So angle BAF + angle FAD = 180 - 90
x + 90 + 67 is not 180

Angle DAF is 90 degrees. Angle DAC is 67 degrees. Angle CAF is the difference between the two angles, and FAC = 90 - 67= 23.

Since BAE is a straight line, angles BAF and FAE are supplementary.
So angle BAF + angle FAE + angle EAC
Angle DAF is 90 degrees. Since BAE is a straight line, angle BAF + angle FAD = 180 degrees

From the diagram, we know that angles FAB + angle FAD = 180 degrees. Also, angle DAC is 67 degrees. Also, angle DAF is 90 degrees. Also angles FAB and x are the same angle. Therefore angles x+ FAD = 180
angle FAD is 90
So, x+90= 180
x = 180 - 90 = 90 degrees.

However, from the diagram, angle DAF is 90 degrees and angle DAC is 67 degrees. Therefore the remaining angle FAC = 90-67 = 23 degrees
If BAE is a straight line, the angle BAF + FAC should be =180.
Therefore, it appears angle BAC is not a line.
angle BAF = x = angle x.
BAF = 180 -90-67 =

However, if AD is perpendicular to BE, then angle DAE = 90 degrees. Then angle DAC = 67. Therefore angle CAE = 90-67 = 23 degrees.
Since BAE is a straight line then angle BAE = 180 degrees.
If angles FAD =90. Angle x + 90=180 then x=90

Another interpretation. If x is on the same side as DAC, and the two combine to 90 degrees:
x+ 67= 90 Then x = 90 -67= 23.
