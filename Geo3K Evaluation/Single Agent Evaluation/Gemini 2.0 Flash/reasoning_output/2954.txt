The figure shows a circle with points A, B, and D on the circumference. Line segment BD is perpendicular to line segment AD. C is the center of the circle, and line segment AB passes through the center of the circle. This means that AB is the diameter of the circle. Since angle ADB is inscribed in a semicircle, angle ADB is a right angle. Therefore, triangle ADB is a right triangle, with the right angle at vertex D. Since AB is the diameter, triangle ADB is inscribed in the circle with AB as the hypotenuse.
The question asks for the measure of angle 2, which is angle ADB. Because BD is perpendicular to AD, the angle ADB is a right angle. Therefore, the measure of angle 2 is 90 degrees.

Final Answer: D
