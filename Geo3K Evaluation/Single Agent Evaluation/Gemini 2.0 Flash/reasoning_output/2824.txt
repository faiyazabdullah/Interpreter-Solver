GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
From the given figure, we observe that CR, BT and AS are the medians of triangle ABC. Since the medians of a triangle intersect at a point that divides each median in a 2:1 ratio, we have the following relations:

CM : MR = 2 : 1
BM : MT = 2 : 1
AM : MS = 2 : 1

We are given that MC = 7 and RM = 4, but since CR, BT and AS are the medians, these are incorrect according to the properties of medians. Also AT = 16, where T is the midpoint of BC. 

We have MC = 7, RM = 4. This information is inconsistent with the property of medians that the medians intersect at a point that divides each median in a 2:1 ratio.
However, assuming that CR, BT, and AS are medians, and M is the centroid, we can use the given information to deduce the ratio of the segments.
We are given CM = 7, RM = 4.
Since M is the centroid, CM/MR = 2/1. But here CM/MR = 7/4 which is not 2/1. There might be an error in the figure.

We have AM : MS = 2 : 1
Let MS = x, then AM = 2x
AS = AM + MS = 2x + x = 3x

Also AT = 16 is given.
Since AT is median, we can use Apollonius' theorem.
AB^2 + AC^2 = 2(AT^2 + BT^2). But this is not needed to solve the problem.

However, since the medians of a triangle intersect at a point that divides each median in a 2:1 ratio, we have:
Given CM = 7, and RM = 4. Let us assume that the point M divides median CR in the ratio of 7/4.
Given AM = 16. And AM/MS = 2/1.
So, 16/MS = 2/1.
Then, 2 MS = 16
MS = 16/2 = 8.
The answers are: A. 2, B. 3.5, C. 4, D. 7
Based on the above calculation the answer is 8, which doesn't match any of the options.

Assuming that M is the centroid, AM/MS = 2/1
If MS = x, then AM = 2x.
So AM + MS = AS
2x + x = AS
AS = 3x

We are given that the intersection of the three medians divides each median in a 2:1 ratio.
If RM = 4, and CM/RM = 2/1, then CM = 2*RM = 2*4 = 8.
If AT = 16, then AM/MS = 2/1. So AM = (2/3)AT, and MS = (1/3) AT
If AT = 16, then AM = (2/3)*16 = 32/3, and MS = (1/3)*16 = 16/3 = 5.33.
No answers match.

Assume the ratio given CM/MR = 7/4 to be correct and not the medians property,
Let AM/MS = 1/2. MS = x. Given AM = 16.
16/MS = 1/2. MS = 2*16 = 32. No answers match.

If AM/MS = 2/1, and AT is not a median
Then AM/MS = 2/1
If AM = 14 then MS = 7.

The diagram appears to suggest that AS is not equal to AT
