Let A be the center of the circle. Let the radius of the circle be r.
Since JH and JK are tangent to the circle from point J, we have JH = 4 and JK = 6.

Let GH = x.
Since GH and JK are tangent to the circle, let's use the property that tangents from a point to a circle have equal length.
Let JG be the length of the tangent from J to the circle at G. Then JG = x + 4.
Let JK be the length of the tangent from J to the circle at K. Then JK = 6.
Therefore, x + 4 > 6, which means x > 2.

The tangent segments from J to the circle are JH and JK. The lengths are JH=4 and JK=6.
The tangent segments from G to the circle are GH and GK. Let the length GH be x. Then the length GK is also x.
The tangent segments from K to the circle are KJ and KG. The lengths are KJ=6 and KG=x.
The tangent segments from H to the circle are HG and HJ. The lengths are HG=x and HJ=4.

Let GJ = x+4. Let JK = 6. Since the tangents from J have lengths JH and JK, we can relate them somehow to get x. However, we are not given the radius of the circle.

Consider the triangle GJK. The sides are GJ = x+4, JK = 6, GK = x.
Consider the triangle HJK. The sides are HJ = 4, JK = 6, HK.

Since we are assuming segments that appear to be tangent are tangent, then we have the length of JK = 6 and the length of JH = 4. Let the radius be r.
Since GH is x, then GJ = x+4. We want to find x.

Let's consider the case where x = 5. Then GJ = 9. The sides of triangle GJK are 9, 6, 5.

If GH = x, then JH = 4, JK = 6. This seems like a trick question.
We have x+4 and 6 as the lengths from point J.
Let x be GH, HJ be 4, and JK be 6.
From external point J, tangents to the circle are JH and JK, thus the length is 4 and 6 respectively.
