The image shows two right triangles, triangle ADB and triangle ABC. Triangle ADB has sides of length x, 4, and y where the right angle is at B. Triangle ABC has sides of length y, z, and 6, where the right angle is at A. Also, the right angle is at B. Since angle DAB is complementary to angle BAC, angle DAB + angle BAC = 90 degrees.

In right triangle ADB, x^2 + 4^2 = y^2. Thus x^2 + 16 = y^2.
In right triangle ABC, z^2 + y^2 = 6^2. Thus z^2 + y^2 = 36.

However, angles ADB and ABC do not have to be similar, so we cannot set up proportional side ratios.
Also, since angle ABD is 90 degrees and angle BAC is 90 degrees, this means that CDB and BAC are right triangles. Angle BCA and angle BAD are complementary, and angles DAC and BCA are complementary.

Consider right triangle ABD. AD = 4, AB = y. Triangle ABC is a right triangle. AC = 6.
Let us try another approach. The triangle ADC has a length of 4+6 = 10.
However, this does not help in solving for the value of y.

Since angles ABD and BAC are right angles, and angles at A and B sum to 90 degrees. We can't use similar triangles since we don't know more angle measurements. The triangles ADB and ABC have a perpendicular from vertex A to side DB, and B to side AC. We have two right triangles. Also, AB is the side length shared by both triangles. AB = y. AD = 4, AC = 6, DB = x, BC = z.

The Pythagorean Theorem gives us:
$4^2 + x^2 = y^2$
$y^2 + z^2 = 6^2$

Since angle ABC is a right angle, then AB is perpendicular to BC. Since angle DAB is 90 degrees, AD is perpendicular to AB.

The triangles ABD and ABC share no similar sides. Thus, the problem is impossible to solve with the given constraints.

However, the angle at A looks like it's a right angle. If ADB and ABC are similar, and we are looking at AD = 4, AC = 6, and AB = y. Then AD/AB = AB/AC.
So 4/y = y/6.
Thus $y^2 = 24$. So $y = \sqrt{24} = \sqrt{4*6} = 2 \sqrt{6}$.
