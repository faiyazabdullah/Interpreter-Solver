$\angle 1$ and $\angle 2$ are a linear pair, so they are supplementary.
$\angle 1$ and $\angle 3$ are also a linear pair, so they are supplementary.
$\angle 1$ and $\angle 4$ are vertical angles. Therefore, $\angle 1 = \angle 4$.

Since $l \parallel m$, we can use the properties of parallel lines cut by a transversal.
$\angle 1$ and $\angle 5$ are corresponding angles, so $\angle 1 = \angle 5$.
$\angle 1$ and $\angle 6$ are alternate exterior angles, so $\angle 1 = \angle 6$.
$\angle 1$ and $\angle 7$ are consecutive interior angles, so $\angle 1 + \angle 7 = 180^\circ$. Thus, $\angle 1$ and $\angle 7$ are supplementary.
$\angle 1$ and $\angle 8$ are corresponding angles with $\angle 4$. Since $\angle 4 + \angle 8 = 180^\circ$, $\angle 1 + \angle 8$ may or may not be supplementary.
We want to find all angles supplementary to $\angle 1$.

$\angle 2$ and $\angle 1$ form a linear pair, so they are supplementary.
$\angle 3$ and $\angle 1$ form a linear pair, so they are supplementary.
Since $\angle 7$ and $\angle 1$ are consecutive interior angles, $\angle 7$ is supplementary to $\angle 1$.
Since $\angle 8$ and $\angle 4$ form a linear pair, we have $\angle 4 + \angle 8 = 180^{\circ}$. Because $\angle 1 = \angle 4$, we have $\angle 1 + \angle 8 = 180^{\circ}$, so $\angle 8$ is supplementary to $\angle 1$.

Therefore, angles 2, 3, 7, and 8 are supplementary to $\angle 1$.
