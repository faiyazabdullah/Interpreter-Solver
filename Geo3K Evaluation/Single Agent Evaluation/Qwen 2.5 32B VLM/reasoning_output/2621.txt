### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
The image shows a triangle \( \triangle RST \) with the following details:
- Side \( RS \) is labeled as \( 4x - 4 \).
- Side \( RT \) is labeled as \( 3x + 3 \).
- Side \( ST \) is labeled as \( 12 + x \).

The pink marks on sides \( RS \) and \( RT \) indicate that these two sides are congruent. This means:
\[ RS = RT \]

#### Step 2: Set Up the Equation Based on Congruent Sides
Since \( RS = RT \), we can write:
\[ 4x - 4 = 3x + 3 \]

#### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 4x - 4 = 3x + 3 \]
Subtract \( 3x \) from both sides:
\[ 4x - 3x - 4 = 3 \]
\[ x - 4 = 3 \]
Add 4 to both sides:
\[ x = 7 \]

#### Step 4: Calculate the Length of \( ST \)
Now that we have \( x = 7 \), we substitute this value into the expression for \( ST \):
\[ ST = 12 + x \]
\[ ST = 12 + 7 \]
\[ ST = 19 \]

#### Step 5: Verify the Solution
We need to verify that the values are consistent with the given conditions:
- \( RS = 4x - 4 = 4(7) - 4 = 28 - 4 = 24 \)
- \( RT = 3x + 3 = 3(7) + 3 = 21 + 3 = 24 \)
- Since \( RS = RT = 24 \), the congruence condition is satisfied.

#### Step 6: Match the Result with the Answer Choices
The length of \( ST \) is \( 19 \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 7
- B. 12
- C. 19
- D. 24

The correct answer is \( 19 \).

### Solution Section

The length of \( ST \) is calculated as follows:
1. From the congruence of \( RS \) and \( RT \), we solve \( 4x - 4 = 3x + 3 \) to find \( x = 7 \).
2. Substituting \( x = 7 \) into \( ST = 12 + x \), we get \( ST = 19 \).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]

Final Answer: C
