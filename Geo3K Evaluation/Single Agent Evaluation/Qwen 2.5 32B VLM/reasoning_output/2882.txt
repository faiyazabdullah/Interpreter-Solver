### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a geometric figure with a circle and several labeled points. The key elements are:
1. **Given Angles**: One angle is explicitly given as \(83^\circ\) at point \(J\).
2. **Unknown Angle**: Another angle is expressed as \((2x - 27)^\circ\) at point \(K\).
3. **Congruent Segments**: The segments \(GH\) and \(KJ\) are congruent (\(GH \cong KJ\)).

The task is to find the value of \(x\) using the given information.

### Thought Section:
#### Step 1: Understand the Congruence Condition
The statement \(GH \cong KJ\) implies that the arcs subtended by these segments are equal. In a circle, equal chords subtend equal arcs, and equal arcs subtend equal central angles. Therefore, the central angles corresponding to these arcs must also be equal.

#### Step 2: Identify the Central Angles
The central angle corresponding to the arc subtended by \(GH\) is the angle at the center of the circle that intercepts the arc \(GH\). Similarly, the central angle for the arc subtended by \(KJ\) is the angle at the center that intercepts the arc \(KJ\).

#### Step 3: Relate the Given Angles
The angle at point \(J\) (which is \(83^\circ\)) is an inscribed angle. An inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc. Therefore, the central angle subtending the arc \(GH\) is twice the inscribed angle:
\[
\text{Central angle for } GH = 2 \times 83^\circ = 166^\circ.
\]

Similarly, the angle at point \(K\) (which is \((2x - 27)^\circ\)) is also an inscribed angle. The central angle subtending the arc \(KJ\) is:
\[
\text{Central angle for } KJ = 2 \times (2x - 27)^\circ.
\]

#### Step 4: Equate the Central Angles
Since \(GH \cong KJ\), the central angles subtended by these arcs must be equal:
\[
2 \times 83^\circ = 2 \times (2x - 27)^\circ.
\]

#### Step 5: Solve for \(x\)
Simplify the equation:
\[
166 = 2(2x - 27).
\]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[
83 = 2x - 27.
\]
Add 27 to both sides:
\[
110 = 2x.
\]
Divide by 2:
\[
x = 55.
\]

### Solution Section:
The value of \(x\) is \(55\). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 27
- B. 54
- C. 55
- D. 83

The correct answer is \(C\).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
