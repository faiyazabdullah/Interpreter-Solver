### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the measure of angle \( \angle FCE \) in the given geometric figure, where \( p \parallel q \). Here's a breakdown of the given information and relationships:

1. **Parallel Lines**: \( p \parallel q \).
2. **Angles Given**:
   - \( \angle JAP = (3x - 60)^\circ \)
   - \( \angle NCF = (2x + 15)^\circ \)
   - \( \angle ABC = y^\circ \)

3. **Key Relationships**:
   - Since \( p \parallel q \), corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and consecutive interior angles will help us solve for the unknowns.
   - We need to find \( \angle FCE \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Use the Parallel Line Properties
Since \( p \parallel q \), we can use the properties of parallel lines to relate the angles.

- **Corresponding Angles**: Angles in the same relative position when a transversal intersects two parallel lines are equal.
- **Alternate Interior Angles**: Angles on opposite sides of the transversal and inside the parallel lines are equal.
- **Consecutive Interior Angles**: Angles on the same side of the transversal and inside the parallel lines sum to \( 180^\circ \).

#### Step 2: Identify Key Angles
From the figure:
- \( \angle JAP \) and \( \angle NCF \) are related through the parallel lines \( p \) and \( q \).
- \( \angle JAP \) and \( \angle NCF \) are supplementary because they form a linear pair with their respective adjacent angles on the transversals.

#### Step 3: Set Up Equations
Given:
- \( \angle JAP = (3x - 60)^\circ \)
- \( \angle NCF = (2x + 15)^\circ \)

Since \( p \parallel q \), the angles \( \angle JAP \) and \( \angle NCF \) are supplementary because they form a linear pair with their respective adjacent angles on the transversals. Therefore:
\[
(3x - 60) + (2x + 15) = 180
\]

#### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
Combine like terms:
\[
3x + 2x - 60 + 15 = 180
\]
\[
5x - 45 = 180
\]
Add 45 to both sides:
\[
5x = 225
\]
Divide by 5:
\[
x = 45
\]

#### Step 5: Find \( \angle NCF \)
Substitute \( x = 45 \) into the expression for \( \angle NCF \):
\[
\angle NCF = 2x + 15 = 2(45) + 15 = 90 + 15 = 105
\]

#### Step 6: Determine \( \angle FCE \)
Since \( \angle NCF \) and \( \angle FCE \) are vertical angles (formed by the intersection of lines \( CF \) and \( CE \)), they are equal:
\[
\angle FCE = \angle NCF = 105^\circ
\]

### Final Answer:
The value of \( \angle FCE \) is \( 105^\circ \).

\[
\boxed{A}
\]
