### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with identifying all angles that are **supplementary** to ∠1 in the given geometric figure. The key points to consider are:
1. **Line \( l \) is parallel to line \( m \)**.
2. **Line \( n \) is a transversal intersecting both \( l \) and \( m \)**.
3. **Supplementary angles**: Two angles are supplementary if their measures add up to \( 180^\circ \).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### **Step 1: Understand the given information**
- Line \( l \parallel m \).
- Line \( n \) is a transversal.
- We need to find all angles supplementary to ∠1.

#### **Step 2: Recall properties of parallel lines and transversals**
When a transversal intersects two parallel lines:
1. **Corresponding angles** are equal.
2. **Alternate interior angles** are equal.
3. **Consecutive interior (same-side interior) angles** are supplementary.
4. **Vertical angles** are equal.

#### **Step 3: Identify ∠1 and its relationships**
- ∠1 is located at the intersection of line \( n \) and line \( l \).
- Since line \( n \) is a transversal, we can use the properties of angles formed by a transversal intersecting parallel lines.

#### **Step 4: Determine angles supplementary to ∠1**
Two angles are supplementary if their measures add up to \( 180^\circ \). Let's analyze the angles around ∠1:
1. **∠2**: This angle is adjacent to ∠1 and forms a linear pair with it. Therefore, ∠1 + ∠2 = \( 180^\circ \). So, ∠2 is supplementary to ∠1.
2. **∠3**: This angle is vertically opposite to ∠2. Since vertical angles are equal, ∠3 = ∠2. However, ∠3 is not supplementary to ∠1 because it does not form a linear pair with ∠1.
3. **∠4**: This angle is also vertically opposite to ∠1. Since vertical angles are equal, ∠4 = ∠1. However, ∠4 is not supplementary to ∠1 because it does not form a linear pair with ∠1.
4. **∠6**: This angle is on the same side of the transversal \( n \) as ∠1 and between the parallel lines \( l \) and \( m \). By the property of consecutive interior angles, ∠1 + ∠6 = \( 180^\circ \). So, ∠6 is supplementary to ∠1.
5. **∠7**: This angle is corresponding to ∠1. Corresponding angles are equal when the lines are parallel, so ∠7 = ∠1. However, ∠7 is not supplementary to ∠1 because it does not form a linear pair with ∠1.
6. **∠8**: This angle is vertically opposite to ∠7. Since vertical angles are equal, ∠8 = ∠7. However, ∠8 is not supplementary to ∠1 because it does not form a linear pair with ∠1.

#### **Step 5: List all angles supplementary to ∠1**
From the analysis above, the angles supplementary to ∠1 are:
- ∠2 (linear pair)
- ∠6 (consecutive interior angles)

#### **Step 6: Compare with the answer choices**
- **Choice A**: angles 2, 3, 6, and 7
  - ∠3 and ∠7 are not supplementary to ∠1.
- **Choice B**: angles 2, 3, and 4
  - ∠3 and ∠4 are not supplementary to ∠1.
- **Choice C**: angles 3, 4, 7, and 8
  - None of these angles are supplementary to ∠1.
- **Choice D**: angles 4, 5, and 8
  - None of these angles are supplementary to ∠1.

The correct choice is **angles 2 and 6**, which corresponds to **Choice A** after removing the incorrect angles.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
