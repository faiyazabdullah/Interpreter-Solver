### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the length of \( GF \) in the second polygon, given that each pair of polygons is similar. The first polygon has known side lengths and angles, while the second polygon has some known side lengths but not \( GF \). We will use the property of similarity, which states that corresponding sides of similar polygons are proportional.

#### Step 1: Identify Given Information
- **First Polygon (Left):**
  - \( RT = 15 \)
  - \( RS = 20.7 \)
  - \( ST = 10 \)
  - Angles: \( \angle R = 27^\circ \), \( \angle S = 43^\circ \), \( \angle T = 110^\circ \)

- **Second Polygon (Right):**
  - \( EF = 11.25 \)
  - \( EG = 27^\circ \) (corresponding to \( \angle R \))
  - \( \angle F = 110^\circ \) (corresponding to \( \angle T \))
  - We need to find \( GF \).

#### Step 2: Use Similarity Property
Since the polygons are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal. We can set up a proportion using the known sides.

#### Step 3: Identify Corresponding Sides
- In the first polygon, \( RT \) corresponds to \( EF \) in the second polygon.
- In the first polygon, \( RS \) corresponds to \( EG \) in the second polygon.
- In the first polygon, \( ST \) corresponds to \( GF \) in the second polygon.

#### Step 4: Set Up Proportions
Using the similarity ratio:
\[
\frac{\text{Side in First Polygon}}{\text{Corresponding Side in Second Polygon}} = \text{Constant Ratio}
\]

From the given information:
\[
\frac{RT}{EF} = \frac{RS}{EG} = \frac{ST}{GF}
\]

We know:
- \( RT = 15 \)
- \( EF = 11.25 \)
- \( RS = 20.7 \)
- \( ST = 10 \)

First, calculate the similarity ratio using \( RT \) and \( EF \):
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{RT}{EF} = \frac{15}{11.25}
\]

#### Step 5: Calculate the Ratio
\[
\frac{15}{11.25} = \frac{15 \times 100}{11.25 \times 100} = \frac{1500}{1125} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

So, the similarity ratio is \( \frac{4}{3} \).

#### Step 6: Use the Ratio to Find \( GF \)
Using the similarity ratio \( \frac{4}{3} \):
\[
\frac{ST}{GF} = \frac{4}{3}
\]
Substitute \( ST = 10 \):
\[
\frac{10}{GF} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Cross-multiply to solve for \( GF \):
\[
10 \cdot 3 = 4 \cdot GF \implies 30 = 4 \cdot GF \implies GF = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5
\]

#### Step 7: Verify the Answer
The calculated value of \( GF \) is \( 7.5 \), which matches one of the given answer choices.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
