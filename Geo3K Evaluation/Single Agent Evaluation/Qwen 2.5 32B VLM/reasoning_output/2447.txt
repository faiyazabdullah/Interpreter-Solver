### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Image
The image shows a quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with the following details:
- Angle \( \angle D = 120^\circ \)
- Angle \( \angle A = (3y + 40)^\circ \)
- Angle \( \angle C = (3x - 70)^\circ \)
- Angle \( \angle B = x^\circ \)

The quadrilateral has two marked congruent triangles (indicated by the pink triangles), suggesting that the sides \(AD\) and \(BC\) are parallel. This implies that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\).

#### Step 2: Use Properties of Trapezoids
In a trapezoid, the sum of the interior angles is always \(360^\circ\). Therefore, we can write the equation for the sum of the angles in quadrilateral \(ABCD\):
\[
\angle A + \angle B + \angle C + \angle D = 360^\circ
\]

Substitute the given expressions for the angles:
\[
(3y + 40) + x + (3x - 70) + 120 = 360
\]

#### Step 3: Simplify the Equation
Combine like terms:
\[
3y + 40 + x + 3x - 70 + 120 = 360
\]
\[
3y + 4x + 90 = 360
\]

Subtract 90 from both sides:
\[
3y + 4x = 270
\]

#### Step 4: Solve for One Variable in Terms of Another
We need to find the value of \(y\). However, we currently have two variables (\(x\) and \(y\)) in the equation. To proceed, we need additional information about \(x\). Since the problem does not provide a direct relationship between \(x\) and \(y\), we will assume that the problem intends for us to solve for \(y\) directly using the given information.

#### Step 5: Revisit the Image for Additional Clues
The image shows that \(AD \parallel BC\), which means that the angles formed by the transversal \(AB\) and \(CD\) are supplementary to the angles at \(A\) and \(B\). However, without loss of generality, we can use the equation \(3y + 4x = 270\) to express \(x\) in terms of \(y\) or vice versa.

#### Step 6: Solve for \(y\)
Since the problem asks for the value of \(y\), we need to isolate \(y\). However, we notice that the equation \(3y + 4x = 270\) alone does not directly give us \(y\) without additional information about \(x\). Given the answer choices, we can test the values of \(y\) to see which one satisfies the equation.

#### Step 7: Test the Answer Choices
Let's test each answer choice for \(y\):

- **Choice A: \(y = 10\)**  
  Substitute \(y = 10\) into the equation:
  \[
  3(10) + 4x = 270
  \]
  \[
  30 + 4x = 270
  \]
  \[
  4x = 240
  \]
  \[
  x = 60
  \]
  This is a valid solution.

- **Choice B: \(y = 20\)**  
  Substitute \(y = 20\) into the equation:
  \[
  3(20) + 4x = 270
  \]
  \[
  60 + 4x = 270
  \]
  \[
  4x = 210
  \]
  \[
  x = 52.5
  \]
  This is a valid solution but does not match the integer nature of the problem.

- **Choice C: \(y = 30\)**  
  Substitute \(y = 30\) into the equation:
  \[
  3(30) + 4x = 270
  \]
  \[
  90 + 4x = 270
  \]
  \[
  4x = 180
  \]
  \[
  x = 45
  \]
  This is a valid solution.

- **Choice D: \(y = 70\)**  
  Substitute \(y = 70\) into the equation:
  \[
  3(70) + 4x = 270
  \]
  \[
  210 + 4x = 270
  \]
  \[
  4x = 60
  \]
  \[
  x = 15
  \]
  This is a valid solution but does not match the integer nature of the problem.

#### Step 8: Verify the Correct Choice
Among the valid solutions, \(y = 10\) is the simplest and most consistent with the problem's constraints. Therefore, the correct choice is \(y = 10\).

### Solution Section

The value of \(y\) that satisfies the equation \(3y + 4x = 270\) and fits the given answer choices is:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
