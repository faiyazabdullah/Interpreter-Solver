### Problem Analysis:
The given image depicts a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with the following details:
- \( AB = 15 \) (vertical side),
- \( BC = 20 \) (horizontal side),
- \( AC = 25 \) (hypotenuse).

We are asked to find the value of \( \cos A \) as a decimal to the nearest hundredth. The cosine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. **Identify the sides relative to angle \( A \):**
   - The hypotenuse \( AC = 25 \).
   - The side adjacent to angle \( A \) is \( AB = 15 \) (since \( AB \) is next to angle \( A \) and not the opposite side).
   - The side opposite to angle \( A \) is \( BC = 20 \).

#### 2. **Use the definition of cosine:**
   The cosine of an angle in a right triangle is given by:
   \[
   \cos A = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
   \]
   Here, the adjacent side to angle \( A \) is \( AB = 15 \), and the hypotenuse is \( AC = 25 \). Therefore:
   \[
   \cos A = \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{15}{25}
   \]

#### 3. **Simplify the fraction:**
   Simplify \( \frac{15}{25} \):
   \[
   \frac{15}{25} = \frac{3}{5} = 0.60
   \]

#### 4. **Round to the nearest hundredth:**
   The value \( 0.60 \) is already expressed to the nearest hundredth.

#### 5. **Compare with the answer choices:**
   The calculated value \( \cos A = 0.60 \) matches option A.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
