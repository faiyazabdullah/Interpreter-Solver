### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Analyze the given image and identify key information
The image shows a parallelogram \(WXYZ\) with the following details:
- Diagonals \(WY\) and \(XZ\) intersect at point \(A\).
- The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other, meaning \(WA = AY\) and \(XA = AZ\).
- The lengths of segments along the diagonals are labeled:
  - \(WA = 2\)
  - \(AY = 2b - 6\)
  - \(XA = 10\)
  - \(AZ = a - 7\)

#### Step 2: Recall the property of diagonals in a parallelogram
In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. This means:
- \(WA = AY\)
- \(XA = AZ\)

Using this property, we can set up equations for the segments of the diagonals.

#### Step 3: Set up equations based on the bisector property
From the property \(WA = AY\):
\[ WA = 2 \]
\[ AY = 2b - 6 \]
Since \(WA = AY\), we have:
\[ 2 = 2b - 6 \]

From the property \(XA = AZ\):
\[ XA = 10 \]
\[ AZ = a - 7 \]
Since \(XA = AZ\), we have:
\[ 10 = a - 7 \]

#### Step 4: Solve the equations
##### Equation 1: Solve for \(b\)
\[ 2 = 2b - 6 \]
Add 6 to both sides:
\[ 2 + 6 = 2b \]
\[ 8 = 2b \]
Divide by 2:
\[ b = 4 \]

##### Equation 2: Solve for \(a\)
\[ 10 = a - 7 \]
Add 7 to both sides:
\[ 10 + 7 = a \]
\[ a = 17 \]

#### Step 5: Reassess the problem
Upon re-examining the problem, it appears there might be a misunderstanding. The question asks for \(a\), but the value \(a = 17\) does not match any of the provided answer choices (A. 2, B. 8, C. 9, D. 10). However, the setup and solution are consistent with the properties of a parallelogram.

#### Step 6: Verify the consistency of the solution
The value \(a = 17\) is derived correctly from the equation \(10 = a - 7\). Since the problem does not provide additional constraints or alternative interpretations, the solution is logically sound.

#### Step 7: Select the closest answer choice
Given that \(a = 17\) does not match any of the provided options, and there is no indication of an error in the setup, the closest answer choice is not applicable. However, since the problem explicitly asks to select one of the provided options, we must choose the closest value.

### Solution Section:

The value of \(a\) derived from the equation \(10 = a - 7\) is \(a = 17\). However, since this value does not match any of the provided answer choices, and there is no indication of an error in the setup, the closest value among the provided options is not applicable. Nonetheless, following the instructions to select exactly one choice, the closest value is not listed.
