### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a rhombus \(ABCD\) with diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\). The diagonals are marked with specific lengths:
- One diagonal (\(BD\)) is split into two equal segments, each labeled as \(12 \, \text{ft}\), so the total length of \(BD\) is \(12 \times 2 = 24 \, \text{ft}\).
- The other diagonal (\(AC\)) is split into two equal segments, each labeled as \(7 \, \text{ft}\), so the total length of \(AC\) is \(7 \times 2 = 14 \, \text{ft}\).

The task is to find the area of the rhombus. The formula for the area of a rhombus when the lengths of its diagonals are known is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2
\]
where \(d_1\) and \(d_2\) are the lengths of the diagonals.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the lengths of the diagonals:**
   - Diagonal \(BD = 24 \, \text{ft}\)
   - Diagonal \(AC = 14 \, \text{ft}\)

2. **Apply the formula for the area of a rhombus:**
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2
   \]
   Here, \(d_1 = 24 \, \text{ft}\) and \(d_2 = 14 \, \text{ft}\).

3. **Substitute the values into the formula:**
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 \times 14
   \]

4. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   24 \times 14 = 336
   \]
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 336 = 168
   \]

5. **Compare the calculated area with the given answer choices:**
   - A. 38
   - B. 84
   - C. 168
   - D. 336

   The calculated area is \(168\), which matches option C.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
