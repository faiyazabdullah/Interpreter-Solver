### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
- The image shows a triangle labeled \( \triangle ABC \).
- The side \( BC \) is given as \( 3.5 \) feet.
- The angle at vertex \( A \) is \( 48^\circ \).
- There are marks indicating that sides \( AB \) and \( AC \) are congruent (isosceles triangle).

#### Step 2: Identify the Type of Triangle
- Since \( AB \) and \( AC \) are marked as congruent, \( \triangle ABC \) is an **isosceles triangle**.
- In an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal. Therefore, the angles at vertices \( B \) and \( C \) are equal.

#### Step 3: Determine the Base Angles
- The sum of the interior angles in any triangle is \( 180^\circ \).
- Let the base angles at \( B \) and \( C \) be \( x \). Then:
  \[
  x + x + 48^\circ = 180^\circ
  \]
  Simplifying:
  \[
  2x + 48^\circ = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  2x = 132^\circ
  \]
  \[
  x = 66^\circ
  \]
- Therefore, the base angles are \( 66^\circ \) each.

#### Step 4: Use Trigonometry to Find the Lengths of \( AB \) and \( AC \)
- In an isosceles triangle, the altitude from the vertex angle (angle \( A \)) to the base \( BC \) bisects the base and creates two right triangles.
- Let the altitude from \( A \) to \( BC \) intersect \( BC \) at point \( D \). Then \( BD = DC = \frac{BC}{2} = \frac{3.5}{2} = 1.75 \) feet.
- In the right triangle \( ABD \):
  - \( \angle BAD = 48^\circ / 2 = 24^\circ \) (since the altitude bisects the vertex angle).
  - \( BD = 1.75 \) feet.
  - We need to find \( AB \).

#### Step 5: Apply Trigonometric Ratios
- Using the cosine function in \( \triangle ABD \):
  \[
  \cos(24^\circ) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{BD}{AB}
  \]
  \[
  \cos(24^\circ) = \frac{1.75}{AB}
  \]
  Solving for \( AB \):
  \[
  AB = \frac{1.75}{\cos(24^\circ)}
  \]
  Using a calculator:
  \[
  \cos(24^\circ) \approx 0.9135
  \]
  \[
  AB \approx \frac{1.75}{0.9135} \approx 1.915
  \]

#### Step 6: Calculate the Perimeter
- The perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is the sum of its sides:
  \[
  \text{Perimeter} = AB + AC + BC
  \]
  Since \( AB = AC \):
  \[
  \text{Perimeter} = AB + AB + BC = 2 \cdot AB + BC
  \]
  Substituting the values:
  \[
  \text{Perimeter} = 2 \cdot 1.915 + 3.5 \approx 3.83 + 3.5 = 7.33
  \]

#### Step 7: Verify and Round the Result
- The calculated perimeter is approximately \( 7.33 \) feet.
- Comparing with the given answer choices, the closest value is \( 7.33 \), but none of the choices match exactly. However, the closest option is \( 7.33 \approx 7.33 \).

### Solution Section:

Based on the calculations:
- The length of each congruent side \( AB \) and \( AC \) is approximately \( 1.915 \) feet.
- The perimeter of the triangle is approximately \( 7.33 \) feet.

However, since the closest matching choice is not available, we select the closest option from the given choices.

Final Answer: **D**

\boxed{D}
