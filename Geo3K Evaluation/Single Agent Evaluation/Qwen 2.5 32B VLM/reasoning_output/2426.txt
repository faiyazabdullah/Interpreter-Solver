### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves two similar rectangles. The key information provided is:
1. The area of the smaller rectangle is \(8 \, \text{in}^2\).
2. The area of the larger rectangle is \(32 \, \text{in}^2\).
3. The width of the smaller rectangle is \(4 \, \text{in}\).
4. The width of the larger rectangle is \(x \, \text{in}\).

We need to find the value of \(x\) using the properties of similar figures.

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Understanding Similar Figures
For two similar rectangles, the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths. If the sides of the smaller rectangle are scaled by a factor \(k\) to form the larger rectangle, then:
\[
\text{Area ratio} = k^2
\]
where \(k\) is the scaling factor for the sides.

#### Step 2: Determine the Scaling Factor
Let the dimensions of the smaller rectangle be \(4 \, \text{in}\) (width) and \(h_1 \, \text{in}\) (height). The area of the smaller rectangle is given by:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{small}} = 4 \cdot h_1 = 8 \, \text{in}^2
\]
Solving for \(h_1\):
\[
h_1 = \frac{8}{4} = 2 \, \text{in}
\]
So, the dimensions of the smaller rectangle are \(4 \, \text{in} \times 2 \, \text{in}\).

Now, let the dimensions of the larger rectangle be \(x \, \text{in}\) (width) and \(h_2 \, \text{in}\) (height). The area of the larger rectangle is given by:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{large}} = x \cdot h_2 = 32 \, \text{in}^2
\]

Since the rectangles are similar, the ratio of their corresponding side lengths is the same. Let the scaling factor be \(k\). Then:
\[
k = \frac{x}{4} = \frac{h_2}{2}
\]

#### Step 3: Use the Area Ratio
The ratio of the areas of the two rectangles is:
\[
\frac{\text{Area}_{\text{large}}}{\text{Area}_{\text{small}}} = \frac{32}{8} = 4
\]
Since the area ratio is the square of the side length ratio:
\[
k^2 = 4 \implies k = \sqrt{4} = 2
\]

#### Step 4: Find \(x\)
Using the scaling factor \(k = 2\):
\[
k = \frac{x}{4} \implies 2 = \frac{x}{4} \implies x = 2 \cdot 4 = 8
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the Solution
If \(x = 8\), the dimensions of the larger rectangle are \(8 \, \text{in} \times 4 \, \text{in}\). The area is:
\[
8 \cdot 4 = 32 \, \text{in}^2
\]
This matches the given area of the larger rectangle, confirming the solution is correct.

The value of \(x\) is:
\[
x = 8
