### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a quadrilateral \(WXYZ\) with labeled angles at each vertex. The goal is to find the measure of \(\angle Z\). Here are the key pieces of information:

1. \(\angle W = a^\circ\)
2. \(\angle X = a^\circ\)
3. \(\angle Y = (a - 28)^\circ\)
4. \(\angle Z = (a + 2)^\circ\)

The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is always \(360^\circ\). Therefore, we can use this property to set up an equation and solve for \(a\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Write the equation for the sum of the interior angles**
The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is:
\[
\angle W + \angle X + \angle Y + \angle Z = 360^\circ
\]
Substitute the given expressions for each angle:
\[
a + a + (a - 28) + (a + 2) = 360
\]

#### **Step 2: Simplify the equation**
Combine like terms:
\[
a + a + a - 28 + a + 2 = 360
\]
\[
4a - 26 = 360
\]

#### **Step 3: Solve for \(a\)** 
Add 26 to both sides:
\[
4a = 386
\]
Divide by 4:
\[
a = 96.5
\]

#### **Step 4: Find \(\angle Z\)** 
The measure of \(\angle Z\) is given by:
\[
\angle Z = (a + 2)^\circ
\]
Substitute \(a = 96.5\):
\[
\angle Z = 96.5 + 2 = 98.5
\]

#### **Step 5: Compare with the answer choices**
The calculated value of \(\angle Z\) is \(98.5^\circ\). However, none of the provided answer choices (A. 80, B. 108, C. 110, D. 112) exactly match \(98.5^\circ\). Since the problem instructs us to select the closest choice, we compare:
- \(80\) is too low.
- \(108\), \(110\), and \(112\) are higher than \(98.5\), but \(108\) is the closest.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
