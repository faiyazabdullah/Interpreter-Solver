### Problem Analysis:
The image depicts a geometric configuration involving a square \(ABCD\) and some additional lines. The key elements are:
1. Square \(ABCD\) with side length \(s\).
2. A diagonal \(AC\) of the square.
3. A point \(W\) on the bottom edge of the square, and another point \(W'\) on the same edge.
4. The distance between \(W\) and \(W'\) is labeled as 12 units.
5. The total length of the bottom edge of the square is given as 8 units beyond \(W\).

We need to determine the **scale factor** from \(W\) to \(W'\). The scale factor refers to the ratio of the distances involved.

---

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the problem**
The scale factor is defined as the ratio of the distances between corresponding points in similar figures. Here, we are looking for the scale factor from \(W\) to \(W'\), which means we need to find the ratio of the distances involved.

#### **Step 2: Identify the distances**
From the image:
- The total length of the bottom edge of the square beyond \(W\) is 8 units.
- The distance between \(W\) and \(W'\) is 12 units.
- Let the distance from \(F\) (the far-left point) to \(W'\) be \(x\).

#### **Step 3: Set up the relationship**
The total length of the bottom edge of the square can be expressed as:
\[
x + 12 = s
\]
where \(s\) is the side length of the square.

#### **Step 4: Use the given information**
The problem states that the total length of the bottom edge beyond \(W\) is 8 units. This implies:
\[
s - 8 = 12
\]
Solving for \(s\):
\[
s = 12 + 8 = 20
\]

#### **Step 5: Determine the position of \(W'\)**
Since \(s = 20\), the total length of the bottom edge is 20 units. The distance from \(F\) to \(W'\) is \(x\), and the distance from \(W'\) to \(W\) is 12 units. Therefore:
\[
x + 12 = 20
\]
Solving for \(x\):
\[
x = 20 - 12 = 8
\]

#### **Step 6: Calculate the scale factor**
The scale factor is the ratio of the distance from \(W\) to \(W'\) to the total length of the segment \(FW\). Since \(FW = x = 8\) and \(WW' = 12\), the scale factor is:
\[
\text{Scale factor} = \frac{WW'}{FW} = \frac{12}{8} = \frac{3}{2}
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The scale factor from \(W\) to \(W'\) is \(\frac{3}{2}\).

\[
\boxed{D}
\]
