====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are given two triangles, \( \triangle RST \) and \( \triangle ABC \), which are congruent (\( \triangle RST \cong \triangle ABC \)). The goal is to find the value of \( x \). The image provides the following information:
1. The angle at vertex \( R \) in \( \triangle RST \) is \( (5x + 20)^\circ \).
2. The angle at vertex \( B \) in \( \triangle ABC \) is \( (3x + 40)^\circ \).
3. The side lengths \( ST = 2y - 8 \) and \( BC = y + 13 \) are also given, but they are not directly needed to solve for \( x \).

Since the triangles are congruent, corresponding angles and sides are equal. Therefore, the angle at vertex \( R \) in \( \triangle RST \) corresponds to the angle at vertex \( B \) in \( \triangle ABC \). This means:
\[ 5x + 20 = 3x + 40 \]

### Thought Section:
1. **Identify Corresponding Angles**: Since \( \triangle RST \cong \triangle ABC \), the angle at vertex \( R \) in \( \triangle RST \) is equal to the angle at vertex \( B \) in \( \triangle ABC \). This gives us the equation:
   \[
   5x + 20 = 3x + 40
   \]

2. **Solve for \( x \)**: To find \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting \( 3x \) from both sides:
   \[
   5x + 20 - 3x = 3x + 40 - 3x
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   2x + 20 = 40
   \]
   Next, subtract 20 from both sides:
   \[
   2x + 20 - 20 = 40 - 20
   \]
   Simplifying further:
   \[
   2x = 20
   \]
   Finally, divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 10
   \]

3. **Verify the Solution**: Substitute \( x = 10 \) back into the expressions for the angles to ensure consistency:
   - For \( \triangle RST \): \( 5x + 20 = 5(10) + 20 = 50 + 20 = 70 \)
   - For \( \triangle ABC \): \( 3x + 40 = 3(10) + 40 = 30 + 40 = 70 \)
   Both angles are equal, confirming that our solution is correct.

4. **Compare with Answer Choices**: The calculated value of \( x \) is 10, which matches one of the given answer choices.

### Solution Section:
The value of \( x \) is \( 10 \). Comparing this with the answer choices:
- A. 8
- B. 10
- C. 13
- D. 21

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
