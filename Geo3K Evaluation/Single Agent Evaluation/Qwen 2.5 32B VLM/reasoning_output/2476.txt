### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the measure of angle \( \angle RMN \) in the parallelogram \( MNPQ \). Let's analyze the given information and apply geometric principles step by step.

#### **Given Information:**
1. The figure includes a parallelogram \( MNPQ \).
2. Angles and side lengths are marked:
   - \( \angle Q = 83^\circ \)
   - \( \angle P = 11.1^\circ \)
   - \( \angle R = 38^\circ \)
   - \( \angle N = 33^\circ \)

#### **Key Properties of Parallelograms:**
1. Opposite sides are parallel and equal.
2. Opposite angles are equal.
3. Adjacent angles are supplementary (sum to \( 180^\circ \)).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Identify the Type of Quadrilateral**
The figure is explicitly labeled as a parallelogram \( MNPQ \). This means:
- Opposite sides \( MN \parallel PQ \) and \( MP \parallel NQ \).
- Opposite angles are equal.
- Adjacent angles are supplementary.

#### **Step 2: Use the Given Angles**
The problem provides the following angles:
- \( \angle Q = 83^\circ \)
- \( \angle P = 11.1^\circ \)
- \( \angle R = 38^\circ \)
- \( \angle N = 33^\circ \)

Since \( MNPQ \) is a parallelogram, we know:
- \( \angle M = \angle Q \) (opposite angles are equal).
- \( \angle R = \angle N \) (opposite angles are equal).

However, the given angles \( \angle P \) and \( \angle R \) do not directly relate to the parallelogram's interior angles. Instead, they seem to be external markings or additional information.

#### **Step 3: Determine \( \angle RMN \)**
To find \( \angle RMN \), we need to use the properties of the parallelogram. Specifically, we focus on the angles at vertex \( M \):
- Since \( MN \parallel PQ \), the angle \( \angle RMN \) is part of the parallelogram's internal structure.
- The adjacent angle to \( \angle RMN \) at vertex \( M \) is \( \angle PMN \).

From the parallelogram properties:
- \( \angle PMN = \angle Q = 83^\circ \) (opposite angles are equal).

#### **Step 4: Use Supplementary Angles**
In a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. Therefore:
\[
\angle RMN + \angle PMN = 180^\circ
\]
Substitute \( \angle PMN = 83^\circ \):
\[
\angle RMN + 83^\circ = 180^\circ
\]
Solve for \( \angle RMN \):
\[
\angle RMN = 180^\circ - 83^\circ = 97^\circ
\]

#### **Step 5: Revisit the Question**
The question asks for \( m \angle RMN \). However, the calculated value \( 97^\circ \) does not match any of the provided answer choices. This suggests a potential misinterpretation or error in the problem setup. Upon re-examining the image and the given angles, it appears that the angle \( \angle R = 38^\circ \) might be relevant to the calculation.

#### **Step 6: Consider the Correct Approach**
Given the angle \( \angle R = 38^\circ \) and the properties of the parallelogram:
- The angle \( \angle RMN \) can be determined by considering the adjacent angle at vertex \( M \):
\[
\angle RMN = 180^\circ - \angle R = 180^\circ - 38^\circ = 142^\circ
\]

However, this still does not match the provided choices. Revisiting the problem, it seems the angle \( \angle R \) might be a mislabel or an external angle. The correct approach is to use the supplementary property with the given \( \angle Q = 83^\circ \).

#### **Final Calculation**
Using the supplementary property:
\[
\angle RMN = 180^\circ - 83^\circ = 97^\circ
\]

Given the provided choices, the closest match is:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]

### Final Answer:
\boxed{D}
