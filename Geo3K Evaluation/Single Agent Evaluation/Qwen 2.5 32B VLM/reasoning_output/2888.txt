### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
The image contains two similar triangles:
1. **Triangle EFG** with side lengths labeled as follows:
   - Base \( FG = 12 \)
   - Height (or one of the legs) labeled as \( x \)
2. **Triangle ABC** with side lengths labeled as follows:
   - Base \( BC = 15 \)
   - One of the legs (height) labeled as \( 10 \)

Both triangles share the same shape but are scaled differently, indicating they are **similar triangles**. The key property of similar triangles is that corresponding sides are proportional.

#### Step 2: Identify Corresponding Sides
From the image, we can see that:
- Side \( FG \) in Triangle EFG corresponds to side \( BC \) in Triangle ABC.
- Side \( x \) in Triangle EFG corresponds to the height \( 10 \) in Triangle ABC.

#### Step 3: Set Up the Proportion
Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal. Therefore, we can write:
\[
\frac{\text{Height of Triangle EFG}}{\text{Height of Triangle ABC}} = \frac{\text{Base of Triangle EFG}}{\text{Base of Triangle ABC}}
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
\frac{x}{10} = \frac{12}{15}
\]

#### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
First, simplify the right-hand side of the proportion:
\[
\frac{12}{15} = \frac{4}{5}
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{x}{10} = \frac{4}{5}
\]
To solve for \( x \), cross-multiply:
\[
x \cdot 5 = 10 \cdot 4
\]
\[
5x = 40
\]
Divide both sides by 5:
\[
x = 8
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the Solution
The proportionality relationship holds true:
\[
\frac{8}{10} = \frac{4}{5}
\]
This confirms that our solution is correct.

#### Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated value of \( x \) is \( 8 \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 6
- B. 8
- C. 12
- D. 15

The correct answer is \( 8 \).

### Solution Section

The value of \( x \) is \( 8 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{B}
\]
