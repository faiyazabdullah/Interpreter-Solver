### Problem Analysis:
We are given a triangle \( \triangle XYZ \) with the following information:
- \( P \) is the centroid of the triangle.
- \( KP = 3 \).
- \( XJ = 8 \).
- We need to find the length of \( YJ \).

From the image, we observe:
- \( J \), \( K \), and \( L \) are points on the sides \( XY \), \( YZ \), and \( ZX \) respectively.
- \( P \) is the centroid, which divides each median into a ratio of \( 2:1 \) (with the longer segment being closer to the vertex).

### Thought Section:
1. **Understanding the Centroid**:
   - The centroid \( P \) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of \( 2:1 \). Specifically, the segment from the vertex to the centroid is twice the segment from the centroid to the midpoint of the opposite side.
   - For example, if \( M \) is the midpoint of \( YZ \), then \( XM \) is a median, and \( XP : PM = 2:1 \).

2. **Given Information**:
   - \( KP = 3 \). Since \( P \) is the centroid, \( KP \) is one-third of the median from \( X \) to \( YZ \). Therefore, the full length of the median \( XK \) is \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \).

3. **Analyzing \( XJ = 8 \)**:
   - \( J \) is a point on \( XY \). Since \( P \) is the centroid, it lies on the median from \( X \) to \( YZ \). The centroid divides the median into a \( 2:1 \) ratio.
   - However, \( XJ = 8 \) does not directly give us the length of \( YJ \). Instead, we need to use the properties of similar triangles and the centroid.

4. **Using Similar Triangles**:
   - Since \( P \) is the centroid, the medians divide the triangle into smaller triangles that are similar to the original triangle.
   - The key is to recognize that the segments involving \( J \) and \( K \) are related through the centroid's properties.

5. **Calculating \( YJ \)**:
   - The centroid divides each median in a \( 2:1 \) ratio. Since \( KP = 3 \), the full length of the median \( XK \) is \( 9 \).
   - The point \( J \) is on \( XY \), and since \( P \) is the centroid, the segment \( YJ \) can be determined using the fact that \( J \) is a point dividing \( XY \) in a specific ratio.
   - Given \( XJ = 8 \), and knowing the properties of the centroid, we can infer that \( YJ \) is twice the length of \( XJ \) because the centroid divides the triangle into segments that are proportional.

6. **Verification**:
   - The centroid's property ensures that the segments are divided in a \( 2:1 \) ratio. Since \( XJ = 8 \), and \( J \) is a point on \( XY \), the length \( YJ \) must be twice \( XJ \) due to the symmetry and properties of the centroid.

### Solution Section:
- From the analysis, we know that the centroid divides the triangle into segments in a \( 2:1 \) ratio. Given \( XJ = 8 \), and using the properties of the centroid, we can conclude that \( YJ = 2 \times XJ = 2 \times 8 = 16 / 2 = 9 \).

Thus, the length of \( YJ \) is \( 9 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
