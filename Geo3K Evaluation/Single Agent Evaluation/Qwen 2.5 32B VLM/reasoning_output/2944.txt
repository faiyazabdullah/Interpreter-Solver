### Problem Analysis:
We are given a quadrilateral \(WXYZ\) that is a rectangle. The key information provided includes:
- \(WXYZ\) is a rectangle, meaning all its interior angles are right angles (\(90^\circ\)).
- The angle labeled \(\angle 1\) measures \(30^\circ\).
- We need to find the measure of \(\angle 2\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Properties of a Rectangle**
A rectangle has the following properties:
1. All four interior angles are right angles (\(90^\circ\)).
2. Opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.
3. The diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other and are equal in length.

From the image, we can see that:
- \(WX\) and \(YZ\) are opposite sides.
- \(WY\) and \(XZ\) are diagonals.
- The diagonals intersect at point \(A\), which is the midpoint of both diagonals.

#### **Step 2: Analyze the Given Information**
- \(\angle 1\) is given as \(30^\circ\).
- \(\angle 1\) is formed by the diagonal \(XZ\) and one side of the rectangle (likely \(WX\) or \(XZ\)).

#### **Step 3: Identify the Relationship Between \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 2\)**
- Since \(WXYZ\) is a rectangle, the diagonals \(WY\) and \(XZ\) bisect each other at point \(A\).
- The diagonals of a rectangle divide it into four right triangles.
- \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 2\) are part of these right triangles.

#### **Step 4: Use Geometric Relationships**
In the right triangle formed by the diagonal \(XZ\) and the sides of the rectangle:
- The sum of the angles in any triangle is \(180^\circ\).
- One of the angles in this triangle is a right angle (\(90^\circ\)).
- Therefore, the sum of the other two angles must be \(90^\circ\).

Given:
- \(\angle 1 = 30^\circ\)
- \(\angle 2\) is the angle adjacent to \(\angle 1\) in the same right triangle.

Thus:
\[
\angle 1 + \angle 2 = 90^\circ
\]
\[
30^\circ + \angle 2 = 90^\circ
\]
\[
\angle 2 = 90^\circ - 30^\circ = 60^\circ
\]

#### **Step 5: Verify the Solution**
- The calculation confirms that \(\angle 2 = 60^\circ\).
- This satisfies the property that the sum of the angles in a right triangle is \(180^\circ\), with one angle being \(90^\circ\).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
