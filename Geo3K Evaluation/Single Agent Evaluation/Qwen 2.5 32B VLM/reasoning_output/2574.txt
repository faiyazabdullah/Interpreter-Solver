### Problem Analysis:
We are given a circle with center \( K \) and diameter \( GJ \). The arc \( \widehat{GH} \) is marked as \( 122^\circ \). We need to find the measure of the arc \( \widehat{GLJ} \).

#### Key Observations:
1. **Diameter Property**: Since \( GJ \) is the diameter, it divides the circle into two semicircles, each measuring \( 180^\circ \).
2. **Arc Relationships**: The total circumference of the circle is \( 360^\circ \). The arc \( \widehat{GLJ} \) spans from \( G \) to \( L \) to \( J \), which includes the entire semicircle minus the arc \( \widehat{GH} \) and its corresponding arc on the opposite side.

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Understanding the Circle's Total Arc Measure
- The total measure of the circle is \( 360^\circ \).
- Since \( GJ \) is a diameter, the arcs \( \widehat{GKJ} \) and \( \widehat{GLJ} \) each measure \( 180^\circ \).

#### Step 2: Analyzing the Given Arc \( \widehat{GH} \)
- The arc \( \widehat{GH} \) is given as \( 122^\circ \).
- Since \( H \) lies on the circle, the arc \( \widehat{HJ} \) (the remaining part of the semicircle containing \( H \)) can be calculated as:
  \[
  \widehat{HJ} = 180^\circ - 122^\circ = 58^\circ
  \]

#### Step 3: Determining the Arc \( \widehat{GLJ} \)
- The arc \( \widehat{GLJ} \) spans from \( G \) to \( L \) to \( J \). This arc includes the semicircle from \( G \) to \( J \) minus the arc \( \widehat{GH} \).
- However, since \( \widehat{GLJ} \) is a semicircle, its measure is always \( 180^\circ \), regardless of the specific position of \( L \) or the measure of \( \widehat{GH} \).

#### Step 4: Verifying the Solution
- The arc \( \widehat{GLJ} \) is a semicircle because \( GJ \) is the diameter. Therefore, its measure is \( 180^\circ \).
- The given arc \( \widehat{GH} = 122^\circ \) does not affect the measure of the semicircle \( \widehat{GLJ} \).

### Solution Section:

Based on the analysis:
- The arc \( \widehat{GLJ} \) is a semicircle, and the measure of a semicircle is always \( 180^\circ \).

Thus, the measure of \( \widehat{GLJ} \) is \( 180^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
