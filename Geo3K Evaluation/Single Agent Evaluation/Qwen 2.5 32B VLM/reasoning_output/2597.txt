### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves an **equilateral pentagon \(PQRST\)** inscribed in a circle \(\odot U\). We are tasked with finding the measure of the arc \(\widehat{QR}\).

#### Step 1: Understand the given information
- The pentagon \(PQRST\) is equilateral, meaning all its sides are equal.
- The pentagon is inscribed in a circle \(\odot U\), which means all its vertices lie on the circumference of the circle.
- The center of the circle is labeled as \(U\).

#### Step 2: Key geometric properties
1. **Properties of an equilateral pentagon**:
   - All sides are equal: \(PQ = QR = RS = ST = TP\).
   - Since it is inscribed in a circle, it is also a **regular pentagon** (all interior angles are equal).

2. **Properties of a regular pentagon**:
   - The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is \(540^\circ\).
   - Each interior angle of a regular pentagon is:
     \[
     \text{Interior angle} = \frac{540^\circ}{5} = 108^\circ
     \]

3. **Central angles and arcs**:
   - The circle is divided into 5 equal central angles because the pentagon is regular and inscribed.
   - Each central angle corresponding to a side of the pentagon is:
     \[
     \text{Central angle} = \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
     \]
   - The measure of an arc is equal to the measure of the central angle that subtends it.

#### Step 3: Identify what needs to be found
We need to find the measure of the arc \(\widehat{QR}\). Since \(\widehat{QR}\) is subtended by the central angle at \(U\) corresponding to the side \(QR\), the measure of \(\widehat{QR}\) is equal to the central angle subtending it.

#### Step 4: Calculate the measure of \(\widehat{QR}\)
From the properties of a regular pentagon inscribed in a circle:
- The central angle subtending each side of the pentagon is \(72^\circ\).
- Therefore, the measure of the arc \(\widehat{QR}\) is also \(72^\circ\).

#### Step 5: Compare with the answer choices
The calculated measure of \(\widehat{QR}\) is \(72^\circ\). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 36
- B. 72
- C. 120
- D. 144

The correct choice is \(B\).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
