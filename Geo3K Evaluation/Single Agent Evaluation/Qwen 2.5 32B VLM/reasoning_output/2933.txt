### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a geometric figure with several lines intersecting at a common point \( B \). The key elements are:
1. Angle \( \angle CBF = 37^\circ \).
2. Line segments \( BD \), \( BE \), \( BG \), and \( BA \) are drawn from point \( B \).
3. We need to find the measure of \( \angle 1 \).

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \( \angle CBF = 37^\circ \).
   - \( \angle 1 \) is formed by the intersection of lines \( BD \) and \( BF \).

2. **Understand the relationship between angles:**
   - Since \( \angle CBF \) and \( \angle 1 \) share the vertex \( B \) and are adjacent angles along the straight line \( BF \), they are supplementary to each other.
   - Supplementary angles add up to \( 180^\circ \).

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - Let \( \angle 1 = x \).
   - Since \( \angle CBF \) and \( \angle 1 \) are supplementary:
     \[
     \angle CBF + \angle 1 = 180^\circ
     \]
   - Substituting the given value of \( \angle CBF \):
     \[
     37^\circ + x = 180^\circ
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = 180^\circ - 37^\circ = 143^\circ
   \]

5. **Re-evaluate the problem:**
   - Upon re-examining the image, it appears that \( \angle 1 \) might be part of a different configuration. Specifically, \( \angle 1 \) could be the vertical angle opposite to \( \angle CBF \).
   - Vertical angles are congruent, meaning \( \angle 1 = \angle CBF \).

6. **Correct interpretation:**
   - If \( \angle 1 \) is the vertical angle opposite to \( \angle CBF \):
     \[
     \angle 1 = 37^\circ
     \]

### Final Calculation:
Given the correct interpretation, \( \angle 1 = 37^\circ \).

### Solution:
The measure of \( \angle 1 \) is \( 37^\circ \).

Final Answer: **A**
