### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a circle with a chord labeled \( BC \) that passes through the center of the circle (point \( A \)). The length of the chord \( BC \) is given as \( 6.2 \, \text{cm} \). Since the chord passes through the center, it is also the diameter of the circle. The task is to find the circumference of the circle, rounded to the nearest tenth.

---

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Identify Key Information
- The chord \( BC \) passes through the center \( A \), making it the diameter of the circle.
- The length of the diameter \( BC \) is \( 6.2 \, \text{cm} \).

#### Step 2: Recall Relevant Formulas
- The circumference \( C \) of a circle is given by the formula:
  \[
  C = \pi \times d
  \]
  where \( d \) is the diameter of the circle.
- Here, \( d = 6.2 \, \text{cm} \).

#### Step 3: Substitute Known Values
- Using the value of \( d = 6.2 \, \text{cm} \) and approximating \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
  \[
  C = \pi \times 6.2
  \]

#### Step 4: Perform the Calculation
- Calculate the circumference:
  \[
  C \approx 3.14159 \times 6.2 \approx 19.477558 \, \text{cm}
  \]

#### Step 5: Round to the Nearest Tenth
- Rounding \( 19.477558 \) to the nearest tenth gives:
  \[
  C \approx 19.5 \, \text{cm}
  \]

#### Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices
- The calculated circumference is \( 19.5 \, \text{cm} \).
- The closest answer choice is \( B. 19.5 \).

#### Step 7: Verify Consistency
- The diameter is correctly identified as \( 6.2 \, \text{cm} \).
- The formula for circumference is correctly applied.
- The rounding is performed accurately.

---

### Solution Section:

The circumference of the circle is calculated as follows:
\[
C = \pi \times 6.2 \approx 3.14159 \times 6.2 \approx 19.477558 \, \text{cm}
\]
Rounding to the nearest tenth:
\[
C \approx 19.5 \, \text{cm}
\]

Thus, the correct answer choice is:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]

Final Answer: B
