### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a circle centered at \( S \) with points \( P, Q, R \), and \( T \) on its circumference. The arc \( \widehat{PQR} \) is given to have a measure of \( 98^\circ \). We are tasked with finding the measure of the arc \( \widehat{PQ} \).

#### Key Observations from the Image:
1. **Circle Center and Points**: The circle is centered at \( S \), and points \( P, Q, R \) lie on the circumference.
2. **Given Arc Measure**: The measure of the arc \( \widehat{PQR} \) is \( 98^\circ \).
3. **Line Segment \( PR \)**: The line segment \( PR \) passes through the center \( S \), making it a diameter of the circle.
4. **Perpendicular Line**: The line segment \( QT \) is perpendicular to \( PR \) and intersects it at point \( T \). This implies that \( QT \) is a radius of the circle and is perpendicular to the diameter \( PR \).

#### Goal:
We need to find the measure of the arc \( \widehat{PQ} \).

---

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry
- Since \( PR \) is a diameter, it divides the circle into two semicircles, each measuring \( 180^\circ \).
- The arc \( \widehat{PQR} \) spans from \( P \) to \( R \) via \( Q \). Its measure is given as \( 98^\circ \).
- The arc \( \widehat{PQR} \) can be divided into two parts: \( \widehat{PQ} \) and \( \widehat{QR} \).

#### Step 2: Symmetry and Perpendicularity
- The line \( QT \) is perpendicular to the diameter \( PR \) and passes through the center \( S \). This symmetry implies that \( \widehat{PQ} \) and \( \widehat{QR} \) are congruent arcs because they are symmetric about the diameter \( PR \).
- Therefore, the measure of \( \widehat{PQ} \) is equal to the measure of \( \widehat{QR} \).

#### Step 3: Calculating the Measure of \( \widehat{PQ} \)
- Let the measure of \( \widehat{PQ} \) be \( x \). Since \( \widehat{PQR} = \widehat{PQ} + \widehat{QR} \), we have:
  \[
  \widehat{PQR} = x + x = 2x
  \]
- Given that \( \widehat{PQR} = 98^\circ \), we can set up the equation:
  \[
  2x = 98^\circ
  \]
- Solving for \( x \):
  \[
  x = \frac{98^\circ}{2} = 49^\circ
  \]

#### Step 4: Verifying the Solution
- The measure of \( \widehat{PQ} \) is \( 49^\circ \), and since \( \widehat{QR} \) is congruent to \( \widehat{PQ} \), the total measure of \( \widehat{PQR} \) is:
  \[
  \widehat{PQR} = \widehat{PQ} + \widehat{QR} = 49^\circ + 49^\circ = 98^\circ
  \]
- This matches the given information, confirming our calculation is correct.

#### Step 5: Selecting the Answer
- The measure of \( \widehat{PQ} \) is \( 49^\circ \).
- Comparing with the answer choices, the correct answer is \( B \).

---

### Solution Section:

The measure of \( \widehat{PQ} \) is \( 49^\circ \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{B}
\]
