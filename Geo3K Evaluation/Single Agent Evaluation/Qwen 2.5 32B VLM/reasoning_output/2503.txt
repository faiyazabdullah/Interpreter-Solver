### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a circle with a central angle of \(30^\circ\) and a radius of 5 units. The shaded region is a sector of the circle. To find the area of the shaded region, we need to calculate the area of the sector using the formula for the area of a sector of a circle.

#### Key Information:
1. **Radius (\(r\))**: 5 units
2. **Central Angle (\(\theta\))**: \(30^\circ\)
3. **Shaded Region**: Sector of the circle

#### Goal:
Calculate the area of the shaded sector and compare it with the given answer choices.

---

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Formula for the Area of a Sector
The area \(A\) of a sector of a circle with radius \(r\) and central angle \(\theta\) (in degrees) is given by:
\[
A = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi r^2
\]

#### Step 2: Substitute Known Values
- Radius \(r = 5\)
- Central angle \(\theta = 30^\circ\)
- \(\pi \approx 3.14159\)

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[
A = \frac{30^\circ}{360^\circ} \times \pi \times 5^2
\]

#### Step 3: Simplify the Expression
First, simplify the fraction \(\frac{30^\circ}{360^\circ}\):
\[
\frac{30^\circ}{360^\circ} = \frac{1}{12}
\]

Next, calculate \(5^2\):
\[
5^2 = 25
\]

Now, substitute back into the formula:
\[
A = \frac{1}{12} \times \pi \times 25
\]

#### Step 4: Calculate the Area
\[
A = \frac{25\pi}{12}
\]

Using \(\pi \approx 3.14159\):
\[
A \approx \frac{25 \times 3.14159}{12}
\]
\[
A \approx \frac{78.53975}{12}
\]
\[
A \approx 6.54498
\]

#### Step 5: Interpret the Result
The calculated area of the sector is approximately \(6.545\). However, this does not match any of the given answer choices. Upon re-examining the problem, it appears there might be a misunderstanding. The shaded region could also include the triangle formed by the radii and the chord, which would require additional calculations.

#### Step 6: Re-evaluate the Shaded Region
If the shaded region includes both the sector and the triangle formed by the radii and the chord, we need to calculate the area of the triangle and add it to the sector's area.

##### Area of the Triangle:
The triangle formed by the radii and the chord is an isosceles triangle with a central angle of \(30^\circ\). The area of such a triangle can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Area of Triangle} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \sin(\theta)
\]
where \(\theta\) is the central angle in radians.

Convert \(30^\circ\) to radians:
\[
30^\circ = \frac{\pi}{6} \text{ radians}
\]

Substitute \(r = 5\) and \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{6}\):
\[
\text{Area of Triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 5^2 \times \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right)
\]
\[
\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{6}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\text{Area of Triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 25 \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{25}{4} = 6.25
\]

##### Total Shaded Area:
Add the area of the sector and the area of the triangle:
\[
\text{Total Shaded Area} = \text{Area of Sector} + \text{Area of Triangle}
\]
\[
\text{Total Shaded Area} \approx 6.545 + 6.25 = 12.795
\]

This still does not match any of the given answer choices. Upon further inspection, it seems the problem might involve a larger shaded region, possibly a segment or a combination of multiple regions. However, based on the standard interpretation of the problem, the closest reasonable calculation is the sector alone.

#### Final Calculation:
Given the discrepancy, the closest reasonable answer based on the sector alone is:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]

### Final Answer:
\boxed{D}
