### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
The image shows a right triangle \( XYZ \) with:
- \( XY = 5 \) (vertical leg)
- \( XZ = 9 \) (hypotenuse)
- \( YZ \) is the horizontal leg, but its length is not directly given.
- \(\angle Y\) is marked as a right angle (\(90^\circ\)).

We need to find the measure of \(\angle Z\) to the nearest tenth.

#### Step 2: Identify Relevant Geometric Relationships
Since \( \triangle XYZ \) is a right triangle, we can use trigonometric relationships to find \(\angle Z\). Specifically, we can use the **tangent function** because it relates the opposite side to the adjacent side of an angle:
\[
\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}
\]
Here:
- The side opposite \(\angle Z\) is \( XY = 5 \).
- The side adjacent to \(\angle Z\) is \( YZ \).

However, \( YZ \) is not directly given. Instead, we can use the **Pythagorean theorem** to find \( YZ \):
\[
XZ^2 = XY^2 + YZ^2
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
9^2 = 5^2 + YZ^2
\]
\[
81 = 25 + YZ^2
\]
\[
YZ^2 = 56
\]
\[
YZ = \sqrt{56} = 2\sqrt{14}
\]

#### Step 3: Use Trigonometry to Find \(\angle Z\)
Now that we have \( XY = 5 \) (opposite) and \( YZ = 2\sqrt{14} \) (adjacent), we can use the tangent function:
\[
\tan(Z) = \frac{XY}{YZ} = \frac{5}{2\sqrt{14}}
\]
To simplify:
\[
\tan(Z) = \frac{5}{2\sqrt{14}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{14}}{\sqrt{14}} = \frac{5\sqrt{14}}{28}
\]

#### Step 4: Calculate \(\angle Z\)
To find \(\angle Z\), we use the inverse tangent function (\(\tan^{-1}\)):
\[
Z = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{5\sqrt{14}}{28}\right)
\]

Using a calculator:
\[
\frac{5\sqrt{14}}{28} \approx \frac{5 \cdot 3.74165738677}{28} \approx \frac{18.70828693385}{28} \approx 0.668153104777
\]
\[
Z = \tan^{-1}(0.668153104777) \approx 33.69^\circ
\]

#### Step 5: Round to the Nearest Tenth
Rounding \(33.69^\circ\) to the nearest tenth gives:
\[
Z \approx 33.7^\circ
\]

#### Step 6: Verify the Answer
The calculated value \(33.7^\circ\) matches one of the answer choices. No further adjustments are needed.
