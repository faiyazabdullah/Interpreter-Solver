### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Image and Identify Key Information
- The image shows a **regular hexagon** (denoted by \( GHEFCD \)).
- Inside the hexagon, there is an equilateral triangle \( ABC \) inscribed.
- The side length of the equilateral triangle \( ABC \) is given as \( 3 \) meters.
- The goal is to find the area of the regular hexagon \( GHEFCD \).

#### Step 2: Understand the Geometric Relationships
- A regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles of equal size.
- The side length of the hexagon is equal to the side length of the equilateral triangles formed by dividing the hexagon.
- The side length of the hexagon is also the same as the side length of the inscribed equilateral triangle \( ABC \), which is \( 3 \) meters.

#### Step 3: Recall Relevant Formulas
- The area of an equilateral triangle with side length \( s \) is given by:
  \[
  \text{Area of equilateral triangle} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2
  \]
- Since the hexagon is composed of 6 such equilateral triangles, the area of the hexagon is:
  \[
  \text{Area of hexagon} = 6 \times \text{Area of one equilateral triangle}
  \]

#### Step 4: Calculate the Area of One Equilateral Triangle
- The side length \( s \) of the equilateral triangle is \( 3 \) meters.
- Using the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle:
  \[
  \text{Area of one equilateral triangle} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 3^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 9 = \frac{9\sqrt{3}}{4}
  \]

#### Step 5: Calculate the Area of the Hexagon
- The hexagon is composed of 6 such equilateral triangles.
- Therefore, the area of the hexagon is:
  \[
  \text{Area of hexagon} = 6 \times \frac{9\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{54\sqrt{3}}{4} = 13.5\sqrt{3}
  \]

#### Step 6: Approximate the Value
- Use the approximation \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \):
  \[
  \text{Area of hexagon} \approx 13.5 \times 1.732 = 23.382
  \]

#### Step 7: Round to the Nearest Tenth
- Rounding \( 23.382 \) to the nearest tenth gives \( 23.4 \).

#### Step 8: Compare with Answer Choices
- The calculated area is \( 23.4 \).
- The closest answer choice is \( C. 23.4 \).

### Solution Section

The area of the regular hexagon is calculated as follows:
1. The side length of the hexagon is \( 3 \) meters.
2. The area of one equilateral triangle with side length \( 3 \) meters is:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 3^2 = \frac{9\sqrt{3}}{4}
   \]
3. The area of the hexagon, composed of 6 such triangles, is:
   \[
   6 \times \frac{9\sqrt{3}}{4} = 13.5\sqrt{3}
   \]
4. Approximating \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \):
   \[
   13.5 \times 1.732 \approx 23.382
   \]
5. Rounding to the nearest tenth:
   \[
   23.382 \approx 23.4
   \]

Thus, the area of the regular hexagon is \( 23.4 \).
