### Problem Analysis:
The given image shows a geometric figure with several labeled points and segments. The task is to determine the length of segment \( PQ \). Let's break down the problem step by step.

#### **Given Information:**
1. The figure includes points \( P, Q, R, S, T \).
2. Segments are labeled with expressions involving \( x \):
   - \( PS = 3 + x \)
   - \( PR = 6 + x \)
   - \( PT = 3 \)
   - \( PQ = 6 - x \)
3. There are congruent triangles indicated by the pink triangles at vertices \( T, Q, \) and \( R \), suggesting some symmetry or similarity in the figure.
4. The goal is to find the length of \( PQ \).

#### **Objective:**
Determine the value of \( PQ \) and select the correct answer from the choices: A. 3, B. 4, C. 6, D. 9.

---

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Analyze the Congruent Triangles
The pink triangles at \( T, Q, \) and \( R \) suggest that the triangles \( \triangle PTQ, \triangle PQR, \) and \( \triangle PSR \) may be similar or have some proportional relationship. However, without explicit angle measures or additional information, we cannot directly use similarity here. Instead, we focus on the segment lengths and their relationships.

#### Step 2: Use Segment Relationships
From the diagram:
- \( PR = 6 + x \)
- \( PS = 3 + x \)
- \( PT = 3 \)
- \( PQ = 6 - x \)

We need to find a relationship between these segments. Notice that \( PR \) is the sum of \( PQ \) and \( QR \):
\[
PR = PQ + QR
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
6 + x = (6 - x) + QR
\]
Solve for \( QR \):
\[
QR = (6 + x) - (6 - x) = 6 + x - 6 + x = 2x
\]

#### Step 3: Use the Congruent Triangles
The congruent triangles suggest that the segments \( QT \) and \( QR \) might be equal. Since \( QT = PT = 3 \) (as \( PT \) is given and \( QT \) is part of the same triangle), we have:
\[
QT = 3
\]
Thus, \( QR = 2x \) must also equal 3:
\[
2x = 3 \implies x = \frac{3}{2}
\]

#### Step 4: Calculate \( PQ \)
Now substitute \( x = \frac{3}{2} \) into the expression for \( PQ \):
\[
PQ = 6 - x = 6 - \frac{3}{2} = \frac{12}{2} - \frac{3}{2} = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5
\]

#### Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated value of \( PQ \) is \( 4.5 \). Since the answer choices are discrete integers, we select the closest option:
- A. 3
- B. 4
- C. 6
- D. 9

The closest value to \( 4.5 \) is \( 4 \).

---

### Solution Section:

After analyzing the geometric relationships and solving for \( x \), we find that the length of \( PQ \) is approximately \( 4.5 \). The closest integer answer choice is \( 4 \).
