### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a circle with several labeled points and angles. We need to find the measure of angle \( \angle 4 \), which is formed by the intersection of two chords within the circle. The given information includes:
- \( \angle RUS = 92^\circ \)
- \( \angle STU = 51^\circ \)
- The point \( V \) is the intersection of the chords \( RS \) and \( UT \).

### Thought Section:
#### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry
The problem involves a circle and intersecting chords. The key property we will use is the **Intersecting Chords Angle Theorem**, which states that the measure of an angle formed by two intersecting chords inside a circle is half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the angle and its vertical angle.

#### Step 2: Identifying Relevant Angles and Arcs
- \( \angle RUS = 92^\circ \) is an angle formed by the intersection of the chords \( RU \) and \( US \).
- \( \angle STU = 51^\circ \) is another angle formed by the intersection of the chords \( ST \) and \( TU \).
- \( \angle 4 \) is the angle formed by the intersection of the chords \( RS \) and \( UT \) at point \( V \).

#### Step 3: Applying the Intersecting Chords Angle Theorem
The theorem states:
\[
\text{Measure of } \angle 4 = \frac{1}{2} \left( \text{Measure of arc } RS + \text{Measure of arc } UT \right)
\]

To find the measure of \( \angle 4 \), we need to determine the measures of the arcs \( RS \) and \( UT \). However, the problem does not directly provide these arc measures. Instead, we can use the given angles \( \angle RUS \) and \( \angle STU \) to infer the relationship between the arcs.

#### Step 4: Relating Given Angles to Arcs
- The angle \( \angle RUS = 92^\circ \) is related to the arcs \( RU \) and \( US \).
- The angle \( \angle STU = 51^\circ \) is related to the arcs \( ST \) and \( TU \).

Since the problem does not provide direct arc measures, we need to use the fact that the sum of the angles around point \( V \) (where the chords intersect) must be consistent with the given angles.

#### Step 5: Using the Inscribed Angle Theorem
The inscribed angle theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts. However, since we are dealing with intersecting chords, we focus on the intersecting chords angle theorem.

#### Step 6: Calculating \( \angle 4 \)
Given the symmetry and the relationships between the angles, we can infer:
\[
\angle 4 = \frac{1}{2} \left( \text{Measure of arc } RS + \text{Measure of arc } UT \right)
\]
Using the given angles:
\[
\text{Measure of arc } RS = 2 \times \angle RUS = 2 \times 92^\circ = 184^\circ
\]
\[
\text{Measure of arc } UT = 2 \times \angle STU = 2 \times 51^\circ = 102^\circ
\]
However, these arc measures are not directly used in the intersecting chords theorem. Instead, we use the fact that:
\[
\angle 4 = \frac{1}{2} \left( \text{Measure of arc } RS + \text{Measure of arc } UT \right)
\]
Since the problem does not provide direct arc measures, we use the relationship between the given angles:
\[
\angle 4 = \frac{1}{2} \left( 92^\circ + 51^\circ \right) = \frac{1}{2} \times 143^\circ = 71.5^\circ
\]

### Solution Section:
Based on the calculations and the intersecting chords angle theorem, the measure of \( \angle 4 \) is:
\[
\boxed{71.5}
\]
