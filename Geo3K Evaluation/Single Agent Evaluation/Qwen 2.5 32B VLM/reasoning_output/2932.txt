### Problem Analysis:
We are given a trapezoid \(ABCD\) with \(AB\) and \(CD\) as the parallel sides (bases). Points \(S\) and \(T\) are the midpoints of the non-parallel sides (legs) \(AC\) and \(BD\), respectively. The lengths of the bases are given as follows:
- \(CD = 14\)
- \(ST = 10\) (the length of the line segment joining the midpoints of the legs, which is known as the **midsegment** of the trapezoid)
- \(AB = 2x\) (where \(x\) is the unknown we need to find)

The goal is to determine the value of \(x\).

---

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understanding the Midsegment Theorem for Trapezoids**
The midsegment (\(ST\)) of a trapezoid is the line segment connecting the midpoints of the non-parallel sides. According to the **Midsegment Theorem for Trapezoids**, the length of the midsegment is equal to the average of the lengths of the two bases. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
\[
ST = \frac{AB + CD}{2}
\]

#### **Step 2: Substituting Known Values**
From the problem, we know:
- \(ST = 10\)
- \(CD = 14\)
- \(AB = 2x\)

Substitute these values into the midsegment formula:
\[
10 = \frac{2x + 14}{2}
\]

#### **Step 3: Solving for \(x\)**

1. Eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:
\[
2 \cdot 10 = 2x + 14
\]
\[
20 = 2x + 14
\]

2. Isolate \(2x\) by subtracting 14 from both sides:
\[
20 - 14 = 2x
\]
\[
6 = 2x
\]

3. Solve for \(x\) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[
x = \frac{6}{2}
\]
\[
x = 3
\]

#### **Step 4: Verifying the Solution**
To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \(x = 3\) back into the expression for \(AB\):
\[
AB = 2x = 2 \cdot 3 = 6
\]

Now, verify the midsegment formula:
\[
ST = \frac{AB + CD}{2} = \frac{6 + 14}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
\]
This matches the given value of \(ST\), confirming that our solution is correct.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
