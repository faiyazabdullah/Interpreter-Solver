### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Image
The image shows a circle with several labeled points and angles. Key observations:
- Points \( G, B, A, J \) lie on the circle.
- Lines \( GB \), \( BH \), \( HJ \), and \( JG \) form a quadrilateral inscribed in the circle.
- Angles \( \angle 2 \) and \( \angle 3 \) are labeled, and their measures are related to \( x \):
  - \( m\angle 2 = 2x \)
  - \( m\angle 3 = x \)

#### Step 2: Understand the Question
We need to find the measure of \( \angle 3 \). The relationship between \( \angle 2 \) and \( \angle 3 \) is given:
- \( m\angle 2 = 2x \)
- \( m\angle 3 = x \)

#### Step 3: Identify Geometric Relationships
Since \( G, B, A, J \) are points on a circle, the quadrilateral \( GBHJ \) is cyclic. In a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of opposite angles is \( 180^\circ \). Therefore:
\[ \angle 2 + \angle 3 = 180^\circ \]

#### Step 4: Substitute the Given Relationships
From the problem, we know:
\[ m\angle 2 = 2x \]
\[ m\angle 3 = x \]

Substitute these into the cyclic quadrilateral property:
\[ 2x + x = 180^\circ \]

#### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)
Combine like terms:
\[ 3x = 180^\circ \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ x = 60^\circ \]

#### Step 6: Determine \( m\angle 3 \)
Since \( m\angle 3 = x \), we have:
\[ m\angle 3 = 60^\circ \]

#### Step 7: Verify the Solution
- \( m\angle 2 = 2x = 2(60^\circ) = 120^\circ \)
- \( m\angle 3 = x = 60^\circ \)
- Check the cyclic quadrilateral property:
  \[ m\angle 2 + m\angle 3 = 120^\circ + 60^\circ = 180^\circ \]
This confirms our solution is correct.

### Solution Section

Based on the calculations:
\[ m\angle 3 = 60^\circ \]

Comparing this with the answer choices:
- A. 30
- B. 45
- C. 60
- D. 90

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{C} \]

Final Answer: C
