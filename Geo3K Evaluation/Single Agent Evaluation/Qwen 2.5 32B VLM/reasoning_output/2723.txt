### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a triangle \( \triangle RST \) with the following information:
- Side \( RS = 2z - 15 \)
- Side \( RT = 9 \)
- Side \( ST = 7 \)

The task is to find the value of \( z \). To do this, we need to use the properties of triangles, specifically the **Triangle Inequality Theorem**. This theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Understand the Triangle Inequality Theorem
The Triangle Inequality Theorem gives us three conditions for the sides of a triangle:
1. \( RS + RT > ST \)
2. \( RS + ST > RT \)
3. \( RT + ST > RS \)

#### Step 2: Substitute the given values into the inequalities
Let's substitute \( RS = 2z - 15 \), \( RT = 9 \), and \( ST = 7 \) into these inequalities.

1. **First inequality: \( RS + RT > ST \)**
   \[
   (2z - 15) + 9 > 7
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   2z - 6 > 7
   \]
   \[
   2z > 13
   \]
   \[
   z > \frac{13}{2}
   \]
   \[
   z > 6.5
   \]

2. **Second inequality: \( RS + ST > RT \)**
   \[
   (2z - 15) + 7 > 9
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   2z - 8 > 9
   \]
   \[
   2z > 17
   \]
   \[
   z > \frac{17}{2}
   \]
   \[
   z > 8.5
   \]

3. **Third inequality: \( RT + ST > RS \)**
   \[
   9 + 7 > 2z - 15
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   16 > 2z - 15
   \]
   \[
   31 > 2z
   \]
   \[
   z < \frac{31}{2}
   \]
   \[
   z < 15.5
   \]

#### Step 3: Combine the inequalities
From the three inequalities, we have:
1. \( z > 6.5 \)
2. \( z > 8.5 \)
3. \( z < 15.5 \)

The most restrictive lower bound is \( z > 8.5 \), and the upper bound is \( z < 15.5 \). Therefore, the range for \( z \) is:
\[
8.5 < z < 15.5
\]

#### Step 4: Check the answer choices
The answer choices are:
A. 7
B. 9
C. 12
D. 15

From the range \( 8.5 < z < 15.5 \), the valid choices are:
- B. 9
- C. 12
- D. 15

#### Step 5: Verify the solution
We need to ensure that each valid choice satisfies all three inequalities. Let's check:

- For \( z = 9 \):
  \[
  RS = 2(9) - 15 = 18 - 15 = 3
  \]
  - First inequality: \( RS + RT > ST \): \( 3 + 9 > 7 \) (True)
  - Second inequality: \( RS + ST > RT \): \( 3 + 7 > 9 \) (True)
  - Third inequality: \( RT + ST > RS \): \( 9 + 7 > 3 \) (True)

- For \( z = 12 \):
  \[
  RS = 2(12) - 15 = 24 - 15 = 9
  \]
  - First inequality: \( RS + RT > ST \): \( 9 + 9 > 7 \) (True)
  - Second inequality: \( RS + ST > RT \): \( 9 + 7 > 9 \) (True)
  - Third inequality: \( RT + ST > RS \): \( 9 + 7 > 9 \) (True)

- For \( z = 15 \):
  \[
  RS = 2(15) - 15 = 30 - 15 = 15
  \]
  - First inequality: \( RS + RT > ST \): \( 15 + 9 > 7 \) (True)
  - Second inequality: \( RS + ST > RT \): \( 15 + 7 > 9 \) (True)
  - Third inequality: \( RT + ST > RS \): \( 9 + 7 > 15 \) (False)

Since \( z = 15 \) does not satisfy the third inequality, it is not a valid solution. The valid choices are \( z = 9 \) and \( z = 12 \).

### Solution Section:
The valid choices that satisfy all the inequalities are \( z = 9 \) and \( z = 12 \). Among the given answer choices, both are valid, but we must select one. Since the problem does not specify further constraints, we choose the smallest valid integer, which is \( z = 9 \).
