### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information and Geometric Relationships
- **Figure Description**: The image shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with points \( D \), \( E \), and \( F \) marked on the sides. There are arrows indicating parallelism between segments \( DE \) and \( BC \).
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( DB = 24 \)
  - \( AE = 3 \)
  - \( EC = 18 \)
- **Objective**: Find the length \( AD \).

#### Step 2: Identify Key Geometric Properties
- The presence of parallel lines \( DE \parallel BC \) suggests that \( \triangle ADE \) is similar to \( \triangle ABC \) by the Basic Proportionality Theorem (also known as Thales' theorem). This theorem states that if a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle intersecting the other two sides, then it divides those sides proportionally.
- Therefore, we have the proportionality relationship:
  \[
  \frac{AD}{AB} = \frac{AE}{AC}
  \]

#### Step 3: Express Known Lengths in Terms of Variables
- Let \( AD = x \). Then \( AB = AD + DB = x + 24 \).
- Since \( AE = 3 \) and \( EC = 18 \), we have \( AC = AE + EC = 3 + 18 = 21 \).

#### Step 4: Apply the Proportionality Relationship
Using the similarity ratio \( \frac{AD}{AB} = \frac{AE}{AC} \):
\[
\frac{x}{x + 24} = \frac{3}{21}
\]
Simplify the right-hand side:
\[
\frac{x}{x + 24} = \frac{1}{7}
\]

#### Step 5: Solve the Proportion for \( x \)
Cross-multiply to solve for \( x \):
\[
7x = x + 24
\]
Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
\[
6x = 24
\]
Divide by 6:
\[
x = 4
\]

#### Step 6: Verify the Solution
- If \( AD = 4 \), then \( AB = AD + DB = 4 + 24 = 28 \).
- Check the proportion:
  \[
  \frac{AD}{AB} = \frac{4}{28} = \frac{1}{7}
  \]
  \[
  \frac{AE}{AC} = \frac{3}{21} = \frac{1}{7}
  \]
The proportions are consistent, confirming the solution is correct.

### Solution Section:

Based on the steps above, the length of \( AD \) is \( 4 \).
