### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a geometric figure with the following key elements:
- A triangle \( \triangle MPN \) with vertices \( M \), \( P \), and \( N \).
- Angles \( \angle M = 56^\circ \) and \( \angle N = 45^\circ \).
- Points \( Q \) and \( P \) lie on a straight line, indicating that \( \angle MPQ \) is an exterior angle to \( \triangle MPN \).

The task is to find the measure of \( \angle MPQ \).

---

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Understand the problem
We need to find the measure of \( \angle MPQ \). Since \( Q \) and \( P \) lie on a straight line, \( \angle MPQ \) is an exterior angle to \( \triangle MPN \). The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.

#### Step 2: Identify the relevant angles in \( \triangle MPN \)
The given angles in \( \triangle MPN \) are:
- \( \angle M = 56^\circ \)
- \( \angle N = 45^\circ \)

#### Step 3: Use the property of exterior angles
The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles. Therefore:
\[
\angle MPQ = \angle M + \angle N
\]

#### Step 4: Calculate \( \angle MPQ \)
Substitute the given values:
\[
\angle MPQ = 56^\circ + 45^\circ = 101^\circ
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the calculation
The calculation is straightforward and aligns with the property of exterior angles. No further adjustments are needed.

#### Step 6: Compare with the answer choices
The calculated value of \( \angle MPQ \) is \( 101^\circ \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 45
- B. 56
- C. 79
- D. 101

The correct answer is \( D \).

---

### Solution Section:

The measure of \( \angle MPQ \) is calculated as follows:
\[
\angle MPQ = \angle M + \angle N = 56^\circ + 45^\circ = 101^\circ
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]

Final Answer: D
