### Problem Analysis:
The problem describes a triangle with angles in the ratio \(3 : 2 : 1\). We need to determine which of the given angle measures (30째, 45째, 60째, 90째) **is not** an angle measure of the triangle. Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- The angles of the triangle are in the ratio \(3 : 2 : 1\).
- The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always \(180^\circ\).

### Step 2: Represent the angles using the ratio
Let the angles be \(3x\), \(2x\), and \(x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier. According to the angle sum property of a triangle:
\[
3x + 2x + x = 180^\circ
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \(x\)
Combine the terms:
\[
6x = 180^\circ
\]
Divide both sides by 6:
\[
x = 30^\circ
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the individual angles
Using \(x = 30^\circ\):
- The first angle is \(3x = 3 \times 30^\circ = 90^\circ\).
- The second angle is \(2x = 2 \times 30^\circ = 60^\circ\).
- The third angle is \(x = 30^\circ\).

Thus, the angles of the triangle are \(90^\circ\), \(60^\circ\), and \(30^\circ\).

### Step 5: Compare with the given answer choices
The answer choices are:
- A. \(30^\circ\)
- B. \(45^\circ\)
- C. \(60^\circ\)
- D. \(90^\circ\)

From our calculations, the angles of the triangle are \(30^\circ\), \(60^\circ\), and \(90^\circ\). Therefore, the angle that is **not** part of the triangle is \(45^\circ\).

### Step 6: Verify the solution
- The angles \(30^\circ\), \(60^\circ\), and \(90^\circ\) satisfy the ratio \(3 : 2 : 1\) and the sum \(180^\circ\).
- The angle \(45^\circ\) does not appear in the set of calculated angles.

### Final Answer:
The angle that is not an angle measure of the triangle is \(45^\circ\).

\[
\boxed{B}
\]
