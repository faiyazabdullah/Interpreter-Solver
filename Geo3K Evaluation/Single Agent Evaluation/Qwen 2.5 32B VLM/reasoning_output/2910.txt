### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with the following features:
- \( AD \perp BC \), meaning \( AD \) is the altitude from vertex \( A \) to side \( BC \).
- \( AD = 36 \).
- \( BD = 6x \).
- \( DC = x \).
- We need to find the value of \( x \).

The key geometric principle here is the **Geometric Mean Theorem** (also known as the Altitude-on-Hypotenuse Theorem), which states:
- If an altitude is drawn to the hypotenuse of a right triangle, then the altitude is the geometric mean of the two segments of the hypotenuse it creates, and each leg of the triangle is the geometric mean of the hypotenuse and the segment of the hypotenuse adjacent to that leg.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Apply the Geometric Mean Theorem
According to the Geometric Mean Theorem:
\[ AD^2 = BD \cdot DC \]

From the image:
- \( AD = 36 \)
- \( BD = 6x \)
- \( DC = x \)

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[ 36^2 = (6x) \cdot x \]

#### Step 2: Simplify the Equation
\[ 36^2 = 6x \cdot x \]
\[ 1296 = 6x^2 \]

#### Step 3: Solve for \( x^2 \)
Divide both sides by 6:
\[ x^2 = \frac{1296}{6} \]
\[ x^2 = 216 \]

#### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
Take the square root of both sides:
\[ x = \sqrt{216} \]

Simplify \( \sqrt{216} \):
\[ \sqrt{216} = \sqrt{36 \cdot 6} = \sqrt{36} \cdot \sqrt{6} = 6\sqrt{6} \]

#### Step 5: Verify the Answer
We have determined that \( x = 6\sqrt{6} \). Now, compare this with the given answer choices:
- A. 6
- B. \( 3\sqrt{6} \)
- C. 12
- D. \( 6\sqrt{6} \)

The correct answer matches option D.

### Final Answer:
\[ \boxed{D} \]
