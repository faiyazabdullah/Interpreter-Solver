### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Image
The image shows a square \(ABCD\) with side lengths labeled \(x\). The diagonal \(AC\) is given as 13 units. We need to find the angle \(y^\circ\) at vertex \(B\), which is formed by the diagonal \(AC\) and side \(BC\).

#### Step 2: Identify Key Geometric Properties
1. **Square Properties**:
   - All sides of a square are equal: \(AB = BC = CD = DA = x\).
   - All internal angles are \(90^\circ\).
   - The diagonals of a square are equal in length and bisect each other at right angles (\(90^\circ\)).

2. **Diagonal of a Square**:
   - The length of the diagonal of a square can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:
     \[
     \text{Diagonal} = \sqrt{x^2 + x^2} = \sqrt{2x^2} = x\sqrt{2}
     \]
   - Here, the diagonal \(AC = 13\). Therefore:
     \[
     x\sqrt{2} = 13 \implies x = \frac{13}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{13\sqrt{2}}{2}
     \]

#### Step 3: Determine the Angle \(y\)
- The angle \(y\) is the angle between the diagonal \(AC\) and the side \(BC\) of the square.
- In a square, the diagonal divides each right angle into two equal parts. Since the internal angle at \(B\) is \(90^\circ\), the diagonal \(AC\) bisects this angle into two \(45^\circ\) angles.
- Therefore, the angle \(y\) is \(45^\circ\).

#### Step 4: Verify the Calculation
- The diagonal of the square bisects the right angles at each vertex, so the angle between the diagonal and any side of the square is always \(45^\circ\).
- This confirms that \(y = 45^\circ\).

#### Step 5: Match the Answer with Choices
- The calculated value of \(y\) is \(45^\circ\).
- The answer choices are:
  A. 30
  B. 45
  C. 60
  D. 90
- The correct choice is \(B\).

### Solution Section

Based on the analysis and calculations:

1. The diagonal of the square is \(13\) units, and the side length \(x\) is \(\frac{13\sqrt{2}}{2}\).
2. The diagonal of a square bisects the right angles at each vertex, so the angle \(y\) is \(45^\circ\).
3. Comparing with the answer choices, the correct answer is \(B\).

Final Answer: **B**
