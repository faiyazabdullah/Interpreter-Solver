### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
The image shows a triangle \( \triangle QRS \) labeled with side lengths:
- Side \( QR = 4x \)
- Side \( RS = 2x + 1 \)
- Side \( QS = 6x - 1 \)

We are told that \( \triangle QRS \) is an **equilateral triangle**. This means all three sides of the triangle are equal in length.

#### Step 2: Set Up Equations Based on the Equilateral Property
Since \( \triangle QRS \) is equilateral, we have:
\[ QR = RS = QS \]

This gives us the following equations:
1. \( QR = RS \)
2. \( QR = QS \)
3. \( RS = QS \)

Substituting the given expressions for the sides:
1. \( 4x = 2x + 1 \)
2. \( 4x = 6x - 1 \)
3. \( 2x + 1 = 6x - 1 \)

#### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
We will solve one of these equations to find the value of \( x \). Let's start with the first equation:
\[ 4x = 2x + 1 \]

Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:
\[ 4x - 2x = 1 \]
\[ 2x = 1 \]
\[ x = \frac{1}{2} \]

#### Step 4: Verify the Value of \( x \)
Now that we have \( x = \frac{1}{2} \), we will verify it by checking the other equations:
1. \( 4x = 6x - 1 \):
   \[ 4\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 6\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) - 1 \]
   \[ 2 = 3 - 1 \]
   \[ 2 = 2 \] (True)

2. \( 2x + 1 = 6x - 1 \):
   \[ 2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 1 = 6\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) - 1 \]
   \[ 1 + 1 = 3 - 1 \]
   \[ 2 = 2 \] (True)

Since all equations are satisfied, \( x = \frac{1}{2} \) is correct.

#### Step 5: Find the Length of \( RS \)
Now that we know \( x = \frac{1}{2} \), we can substitute it into the expression for \( RS \):
\[ RS = 2x + 1 \]
\[ RS = 2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 1 \]
\[ RS = 1 + 1 \]
\[ RS = 2 \]

#### Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated length of \( RS \) is \( 2 \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 0.5
- B. 1
- C. 1.5
- D. 2

The correct answer is \( 2 \).

### Solution Section

Based on the detailed analysis and calculations:
1. We determined that \( x = \frac{1}{2} \) satisfies all conditions for the equilateral triangle.
2. Substituting \( x = \frac{1}{2} \) into the expression for \( RS \) gave us \( RS = 2 \).
3. The answer matches one of the provided choices.

Final Answer: **D**
