### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves two similar triangles. Similar triangles have proportional corresponding sides. The goal is to find the value of \( x \) using the given side lengths and the property of similarity.

#### Step 1: Identify the Similar Triangles
From the image:
- The left triangle has sides \( 12 \), \( 2x \), and \( 20 \).
- The right triangle has sides \( y + 4 \), \( 12 \), and \( 15 \).

The markings on the triangles indicate that they are similar, meaning their corresponding sides are proportional.

#### Step 2: Set Up Proportions
Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides must be equal. We can use any pair of corresponding sides to set up the proportion. Let's use the sides \( 12 \) and \( 12 \) (which are corresponding sides) and the sides \( 20 \) and \( 15 \) (which are also corresponding sides).

The proportion can be written as:
\[
\frac{20}{15} = \frac{12}{12}
\]

However, this proportion does not involve \( x \). Instead, we need to use the side \( 2x \) from the left triangle and its corresponding side \( y + 4 \) from the right triangle. The corresponding side to \( 2x \) in the right triangle is \( y + 4 \).

#### Step 3: Use the Proportion Involving \( x \)
The proportion involving \( x \) is:
\[
\frac{2x}{y + 4} = \frac{20}{15}
\]

Simplify the right-hand side:
\[
\frac{20}{15} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

So the proportion becomes:
\[
\frac{2x}{y + 4} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

#### Step 4: Solve for \( y \) Using Another Proportion
We need to find \( y \) first. Use the proportion involving the sides \( 12 \) and \( 12 \):
\[
\frac{12}{12} = \frac{12}{y + 4}
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
1 = \frac{12}{y + 4}
\]

Solving for \( y \):
\[
y + 4 = 12 \implies y = 8
\]

#### Step 5: Substitute \( y \) Back into the Proportion
Now substitute \( y = 8 \) into the proportion:
\[
\frac{2x}{y + 4} = \frac{4}{3} \implies \frac{2x}{8 + 4} = \frac{4}{3} \implies \frac{2x}{12} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Simplify:
\[
\frac{2x}{12} = \frac{4}{3} \implies \frac{x}{6} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Solve for \( x \):
\[
x = 6 \cdot \frac{4}{3} = 8
\]

### Solution:
The value of \( x \) is \( 8 \).

Final Answer: \boxed{A}
