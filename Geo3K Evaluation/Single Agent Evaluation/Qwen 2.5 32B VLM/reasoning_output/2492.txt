### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Analyze the Image
The image shows a circle with several labeled points and segments:
- Points \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) are on the circumference of the circle.
- Segments \( AB \) and \( DF \) are chords of the circle.
- The lengths of these chords are given as:
  - \( AB = 9x \)
  - \( DF = 2x + 14 \)
- It is stated that \( AB \cong DF \), meaning the lengths of \( AB \) and \( DF \) are equal.

#### Step 2: Understand the Problem
We need to find the value of \( x \) such that the lengths of \( AB \) and \( DF \) are equal. This is based on the given condition \( AB \cong DF \).

#### Step 3: Set Up the Equation
Since \( AB \cong DF \), we can write the equation:
\[
AB = DF
\]
Substituting the given expressions for \( AB \) and \( DF \):
\[
9x = 2x + 14
\]

#### Step 4: Solve the Equation
To solve for \( x \), follow these steps:
1. Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides of the equation:
\[
9x - 2x = 14
\]
\[
7x = 14
\]
2. Divide both sides by 7:
\[
x = \frac{14}{7}
\]
\[
x = 2
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the Solution
Substitute \( x = 2 \) back into the expressions for \( AB \) and \( DF \):
- \( AB = 9x = 9(2) = 18 \)
- \( DF = 2x + 14 = 2(2) + 14 = 4 + 14 = 18 \)
Since \( AB = DF = 18 \), the solution is consistent with the given condition \( AB \cong DF \).

#### Step 6: Select the Correct Answer
The calculated value of \( x \) is 2. Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 1
- B. 2
- C. 3
- D. 4

The correct answer is \( B \).

### Solution Section:

The value of \( x \) is determined by solving the equation \( 9x = 2x + 14 \). Following the steps:
1. \( 9x - 2x = 14 \)
2. \( 7x = 14 \)
3. \( x = 2 \)

Thus, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]

Final Answer: B
