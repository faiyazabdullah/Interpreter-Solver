### Problem Analysis:
The image depicts a geometric figure involving two intersecting lines \( p \) and \( m \), creating several angles labeled from 1 to 8. The key information provided in the problem is:
- \( m\angle 5 = 7x - 5 \)
- \( m\angle 4 = 2x + 23 \)

We need to find the value of \( x \). To do this, we must use the geometric relationships between the angles formed by the intersection of the lines.

#### Step 1: Identify the relationship between \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 5 \)
From the image, \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 5 \) are **vertical angles**. Vertical angles are always congruent, meaning:
\[
m\angle 4 = m\angle 5
\]

#### Step 2: Set up the equation using the given expressions
Using the congruence property of vertical angles:
\[
m\angle 4 = m\angle 5
\]
Substitute the given expressions for \( m\angle 4 \) and \( m\angle 5 \):
\[
2x + 23 = 7x - 5
\]

#### Step 3: Solve the equation for \( x \)
Rearrange the equation to isolate \( x \):
\[
2x + 23 = 7x - 5
\]
Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:
\[
23 = 5x - 5
\]
Add 5 to both sides:
\[
28 = 5x
\]
Divide both sides by 5:
\[
x = \frac{28}{5} = 5.6
\]

#### Step 4: Verify the solution
Substitute \( x = 5.6 \) back into the expressions for \( m\angle 4 \) and \( m\angle 5 \):
\[
m\angle 4 = 2x + 23 = 2(5.6) + 23 = 11.2 + 23 = 34.2
\]
\[
m\angle 5 = 7x - 5 = 7(5.6) - 5 = 39.2 - 5 = 34.2
\]
Since \( m\angle 4 = m\angle 5 = 34.2 \), the solution is verified.

### Final Answer:
The value of \( x \) is \( 5.6 \). Comparing this with the given answer choices, the closest match is:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]

Final Answer: A
