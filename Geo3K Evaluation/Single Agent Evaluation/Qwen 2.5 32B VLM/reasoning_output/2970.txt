====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given image depicts a geometric figure involving triangles and right angles. Here's a breakdown of the information provided:

1. **Right Triangles**:
   - Triangle \( \triangle BXW \) has a right angle at \( X \).
   - Triangle \( \triangle AZW \) has a right angle at \( Z \).

2. **Given Measurements**:
   - Both legs of \( \triangle BXW \) and \( \triangle AZW \) are equal (each leg is 4 units long).
   - The hypotenuse \( BW \) and \( AW \) are not explicitly measured but can be inferred as equal due to symmetry.

3. **Angle Information**:
   - \( \angle WYZ = 23^\circ \).

4. **Objective**:
   - Find the measure of \( \angle WYZ \).

### Thought Section:
#### Step 1: Analyze the Structure
The figure shows two congruent right triangles \( \triangle BXW \) and \( \triangle AZW \) because:
- Both have right angles at \( X \) and \( Z \).
- Both have equal legs (4 units each).
- By the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) congruence criterion, \( \triangle BXW \cong \triangle AZW \).

#### Step 2: Use Congruence Properties
Since \( \triangle BXW \cong \triangle AZW \):
- Corresponding sides and angles are equal.
- Therefore, \( \angle WBX = \angle WAZ \).

#### Step 3: Identify Relevant Angles
The problem asks for \( \angle WYZ \), which is explicitly given as \( 23^\circ \) in the figure. This angle is part of triangle \( \triangle WYZ \), and no additional calculations are needed to determine its value.

#### Step 4: Verify Consistency
The given angle \( \angle WYZ = 23^\circ \) is consistent with the information provided in the image. There are no conflicting details or additional constraints that would alter this measurement.

### Solution Section:
Based on the analysis:
- The angle \( \angle WYZ \) is directly provided as \( 23^\circ \) in the image.
- No further calculations are required since the problem does not involve finding missing angles or sides beyond what is already given.

Thus, the measure of \( \angle WYZ \) is \( 23^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
