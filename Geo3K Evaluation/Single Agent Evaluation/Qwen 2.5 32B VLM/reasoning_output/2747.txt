### Problem Analysis:
The given image shows a rectangle with dimensions labeled, and an additional diagonal line creating a right triangle within the rectangle. Here's a breakdown of the information:

1. **Rectangle Dimensions**:
   - Length (AB) = 3 inches.
   - Width (AD) = Not directly given but can be inferred using the right triangle and angle information.

2. **Right Triangle**:
   - The diagonal AN forms a right triangle with sides AD and DN.
   - One angle of the triangle is given as \(62^\circ\).

3. **Objective**:
   - Find the area of the entire figure (rectangle).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the Known Information
- The rectangle has one side (length) of 3 inches.
- The diagonal AN forms a right triangle with the sides AD and DN.
- The angle between the diagonal AN and the base DN is \(62^\circ\).

#### Step 2: Use Trigonometry to Find the Width (AD)
In the right triangle ADN:
- The length of the hypotenuse (AN) is not directly given, but we can use trigonometric relationships involving the angle \(62^\circ\) and the adjacent side (DN).
- Let the width of the rectangle (AD) be denoted as \(h\).
- The relationship between the angle, the adjacent side (DN), and the opposite side (AD) can be expressed using the tangent function:
  \[
  \tan(62^\circ) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{AD}{DN}
  \]
- Since DN is the same as the length of the rectangle (3 inches), we have:
  \[
  \tan(62^\circ) = \frac{h}{3}
  \]
- Solving for \(h\):
  \[
  h = 3 \cdot \tan(62^\circ)
  \]

#### Step 3: Calculate the Value of \(h\)
Using a calculator to find \(\tan(62^\circ)\):
\[
\tan(62^\circ) \approx 1.8807
\]
Thus:
\[
h = 3 \cdot 1.8807 \approx 5.6421
\]

#### Step 4: Calculate the Area of the Rectangle
The area \(A\) of the rectangle is given by:
\[
A = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 3 \times 5.6421 \approx 16.9263
\]

#### Step 5: Round to the Nearest Hundredth
Rounding \(16.9263\) to the nearest hundredth gives:
\[
A \approx 16.93
\]

### Final Answer:
The closest answer choice to \(16.93\) is \(16.9\).

\[
\boxed{D}
\]

Final Answer: D
