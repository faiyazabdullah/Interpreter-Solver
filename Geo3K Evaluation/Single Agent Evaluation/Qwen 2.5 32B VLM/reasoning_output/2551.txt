### Problem Analysis:
The image depicts a triangle \( \triangle XYZ \) with points \( M \) and \( N \) lying on sides \( XY \) and \( XZ \), respectively. The problem provides the following measurements:
- \( XM = 4 \)
- \( XN = 6 \)
- \( NZ = 9 \)

We are tasked with finding the length of \( XY \). Let us analyze the geometric relationships and constraints in the image.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Points \( M \) and \( N \)**: These points lie on the sides \( XY \) and \( XZ \), respectively.
2. **Right Angles**: There are right angles at \( M \) and \( N \), indicating that \( MN \) is perpendicular to both \( XY \) and \( XZ \).
3. **Similar Triangles**: Since \( MN \) is perpendicular to both \( XY \) and \( XZ \), triangles \( \triangle XMY \) and \( \triangle XNZ \) are similar by AA similarity (both have right angles and share the angle at \( X \)).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify Similar Triangles
From the image, we can see that:
- \( \angle XMY = \angle XNZ = 90^\circ \) (right angles)
- \( \angle MXY = \angle NXZ \) (common angle at \( X \))

Thus, \( \triangle XMY \sim \triangle XNZ \) by AA similarity.

#### Step 2: Use Proportionality of Similar Triangles
For similar triangles, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal. Therefore:
\[
\frac{XM}{XN} = \frac{XY}{XZ}
\]

#### Step 3: Express \( XZ \) in Terms of Given Values
From the problem, we know:
- \( XM = 4 \)
- \( XN = 6 \)
- \( NZ = 9 \)

Since \( XZ = XN + NZ \):
\[
XZ = 6 + 9 = 15
\]

#### Step 4: Set Up the Proportion
Using the similarity ratio:
\[
\frac{XM}{XN} = \frac{XY}{XZ}
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
\frac{4}{6} = \frac{XY}{15}
\]

#### Step 5: Solve for \( XY \)
Cross-multiply to solve for \( XY \):
\[
4 \cdot 15 = 6 \cdot XY
\]
\[
60 = 6 \cdot XY
\]
\[
XY = \frac{60}{6} = 10
\]

### Final Answer:
The length of \( XY \) is \( 10 \).

\[
\boxed{D}
\]

### Verification:
- The similarity ratio \( \frac{XM}{XN} = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \) is consistent with the proportion \( \frac{XY}{XZ} = \frac{10}{15} = \frac{2}{3} \).
- All calculations are consistent with the given information and geometric properties.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
