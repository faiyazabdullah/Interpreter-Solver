### Problem Analysis:
The given problem involves a geometric figure with multiple lines, angles, and points labeled. The goal is to determine the measure of \( \angle 11 \) given that \( m\angle 3 = 43^\circ \). Let us analyze the figure step by step to understand the relationships between the angles.

#### Key Observations from the Image:
1. **Parallel Lines**: The lines \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), and \( d \) appear to be parallel, as indicated by the arrowheads.
2. **Transversals**: There are multiple transversals intersecting these parallel lines, creating corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and supplementary angles.
3. **Angle Relationships**:
   - \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 11 \) are related through the properties of parallel lines and transversals.
   - \( \angle 3 \) is given as \( 43^\circ \).

#### Goal:
We need to find \( m\angle 11 \) using the given information and geometric properties.

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Identify the Relationship Between \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 11 \)
- \( \angle 3 \) is formed by the intersection of the transversal \( KO \) with the parallel lines \( b \) and \( c \).
- \( \angle 11 \) is formed by the intersection of the transversal \( HN \) with the parallel lines \( c \) and \( d \).

Since \( a \parallel b \parallel c \parallel d \), we can use the properties of parallel lines and transversals to relate \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 11 \).

#### Step 2: Use Corresponding Angles
- When a transversal intersects two parallel lines, corresponding angles are congruent.
- \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 11 \) are corresponding angles because they are on the same side of their respective transversals and between the same pair of parallel lines \( c \) and \( d \).

Thus, \( \angle 3 \cong \angle 11 \).

#### Step 3: Apply the Given Information
- We are given \( m\angle 3 = 43^\circ \).
- Since \( \angle 3 \cong \angle 11 \), it follows that \( m\angle 11 = 43^\circ \).

#### Step 4: Verify the Solution
- The relationship between corresponding angles is a fundamental property of parallel lines.
- No additional calculations or corrections are needed since the relationship is direct and straightforward.

---

### Solution Section:

From the analysis, we have established that \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 11 \) are corresponding angles. Therefore:
\[
m\angle 11 = m\angle 3 = 43^\circ
\]

Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 43
- B. 53
- C. 63
- D. 137

The correct answer is \( \boxed{A} \).
