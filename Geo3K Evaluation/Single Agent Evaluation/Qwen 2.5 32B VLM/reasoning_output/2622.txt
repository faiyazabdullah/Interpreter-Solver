====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the area of the green figure, which is similar to the larger blue diamond (rhombus). The key information provided includes:
1. The area of the larger blue rhombus: \( A = 36 \, \text{yd}^2 \).
2. The height of the larger blue rhombus: \( 8 \, \text{yd} \).
3. The height of the smaller green rhombus: \( 4 \, \text{yd} \).

Since the two figures are similar, their corresponding dimensions are proportional. We will use the relationship between the areas of similar figures, which is the square of the ratio of their corresponding linear dimensions.

---

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the relationship between similar figures**
For similar figures, the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding linear dimensions. If the height of the larger rhombus is \( h_1 \) and the height of the smaller rhombus is \( h_2 \), then:
\[
\text{Ratio of heights} = \frac{h_1}{h_2}
\]
The ratio of the areas is:
\[
\left( \frac{h_1}{h_2} \right)^2
\]

#### **Step 2: Calculate the ratio of the heights**
From the image:
- Height of the larger rhombus (\( h_1 \)): \( 8 \, \text{yd} \)
- Height of the smaller rhombus (\( h_2 \)): \( 4 \, \text{yd} \)

The ratio of the heights is:
\[
\frac{h_1}{h_2} = \frac{8}{4} = 2
\]

#### **Step 3: Use the area ratio formula**
The ratio of the areas of the two rhombuses is the square of the ratio of their heights:
\[
\text{Area ratio} = \left( \frac{h_1}{h_2} \right)^2 = 2^2 = 4
\]

This means the area of the larger rhombus is 4 times the area of the smaller rhombus. Let \( A_{\text{small}} \) be the area of the smaller rhombus. Then:
\[
\frac{A_{\text{large}}}{A_{\text{small}}} = 4
\]

#### **Step 4: Solve for the area of the smaller rhombus**
We know the area of the larger rhombus (\( A_{\text{large}} \)) is \( 36 \, \text{yd}^2 \). Therefore:
\[
\frac{36}{A_{\text{small}}} = 4
\]
Solving for \( A_{\text{small}} \):
\[
A_{\text{small}} = \frac{36}{4} = 9 \, \text{yd}^2
\]

#### **Step 5: Verify the result**
The area of the smaller rhombus is \( 9 \, \text{yd}^2 \). This is consistent with the similarity ratio and the given data.

---

### Final Answer:
The area of the green figure is \( 9 \, \text{yd}^2 \).

\[
\boxed{A}
\]
