### Problem Analysis:
The given image depicts a quadrilateral with specific dimensions and angles. Here's a breakdown of the information provided:
- The quadrilateral has sides of lengths 12 inches and 8 inches.
- One angle is given as \(30^\circ\).
- The figure appears to be a trapezoid, with the side of length 12 inches being parallel to the side of length 8 inches (the bases).
- The height of the trapezoid can be determined using the \(30^\circ\) angle and the perpendicular distance between the bases.

#### Key Observations:
1. The quadrilateral is a trapezoid with bases of lengths 12 inches and 8 inches.
2. The \(30^\circ\) angle is formed by one of the non-parallel sides and the base of length 8 inches.
3. The height of the trapezoid can be calculated using trigonometry, specifically the sine function, since the height is opposite the \(30^\circ\) angle in a right triangle formed by dropping a perpendicular from the top base to the bottom base.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the Height of the Trapezoid
To find the height \( h \) of the trapezoid, consider the right triangle formed by:
- The height \( h \) as the opposite side,
- The hypotenuse as the slant height of the trapezoid (which is not directly given but can be inferred),
- The angle \(30^\circ\).

Using the sine function:
\[
\sin(30^\circ) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{h}{\text{slant height}}
\]
However, we don't need the slant height directly. Instead, we can use the difference in the lengths of the bases to find the horizontal projection of the slant height.

The difference in the lengths of the bases is:
\[
12 - 8 = 4 \text{ inches}
\]
This difference is split equally on both sides of the trapezoid because the height is perpendicular to the bases. Therefore, each segment of the base is:
\[
\frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ inches}
\]

Now, using the right triangle with the \(30^\circ\) angle and the adjacent side of 2 inches:
\[
\sin(30^\circ) = \frac{h}{\text{hypotenuse}}, \quad \cos(30^\circ) = \frac{2}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
Since \(\sin(30^\circ) = \frac{1}{2}\):
\[
h = 2 \cdot \tan(30^\circ)
\]
Using \(\tan(30^\circ) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\):
\[
h = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3} \approx 1.1547 \text{ inches}
\]

#### Step 2: Calculate the Area of the Trapezoid
The formula for the area \( A \) of a trapezoid is:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (b_1 + b_2) \cdot h
\]
where \( b_1 \) and \( b_2 \) are the lengths of the bases, and \( h \) is the height.

Substitute the known values:
\[
b_1 = 12 \text{ inches}, \quad b_2 = 8 \text{ inches}, \quad h = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3} \approx 1.1547 \text{ inches}
\]
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (12 + 8) \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 20 \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{20 \cdot 2\sqrt{3}}{6} = \frac{40\sqrt{3}}{6} = \frac{20\sqrt{3}}{3} \approx 11.547 \text{ square inches}
\]

#### Step 3: Convert the Area to Square Feet
Since 1 foot = 12 inches, 1 square foot = \(12 \times 12 = 144\) square inches. Convert the area from square inches to square feet:
\[
A_{\text{feet}} = \frac{11.547}{144} \approx 0.0802 \text{ square feet}
\]

#### Step 4: Re-evaluate the Height Calculation
Upon re-evaluating, the height calculation seems incorrect due to a misunderstanding. The correct approach is to use the full length of the base difference (4 inches) and the correct trigonometric relationship:
\[
h = 4 \cdot \tan(30^\circ) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{4}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3} \approx 2.3094 \text{ inches}
\]

Re-calculate the area:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (12 + 8) \cdot \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 20 \cdot \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{20 \cdot 4\sqrt{3}}{6} = \frac{80\sqrt{3}}{6} = \frac{40\sqrt{3}}{3} \approx 23.094 \text{ square inches}
\]
Convert to square feet:
\[
A_{\text{feet}} = \frac{23.094}{144} \approx 0.1603 \text{ square feet}
\]

#### Step 5: Correct Approach
The correct height should be recalculated using the full base difference:
\[
h = 4 \cdot \tan(30^\circ) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3} \approx 2.3094 \text{ inches}
\]
Re-calculate the area:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (12 + 8) \cdot 2.3094 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 20 \cdot 2.3094 = 23.094 \text{ square inches}
\]
Convert to square feet:
\[
A_{\text{feet}} = \frac{23.094}{144} \approx 0.1603 \text{ square feet}
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
