### Problem Analysis:
We are given a geometric figure with the following key elements:
- \( XY \) and \( XZ \) are midsegments of \( \triangle RST \).
- The length of \( RT \) is given as 13 units.
- We need to find the length of \( ST \).

#### Step 1: Understanding Midsegments
A **midsegment** of a triangle is a line segment connecting the midpoints of two sides of the triangle. According to the **Midsegment Theorem**:
- A midsegment is parallel to the third side of the triangle.
- A midsegment is half the length of the third side of the triangle.

In this problem:
- \( XY \) is a midsegment of \( \triangle RST \), so it is parallel to \( ST \) and \( XY = \frac{1}{2} ST \).
- \( XZ \) is a midsegment of \( \triangle RST \), so it is parallel to \( RT \) and \( XZ = \frac{1}{2} RT \).

#### Step 2: Applying the Midsegment Theorem
From the figure:
- \( XZ \) is parallel to \( RT \) and \( XZ = \frac{1}{2} RT \).
- Given \( RT = 13 \), we have:
  \[
  XZ = \frac{1}{2} \times 13 = 6.5
  \]

#### Step 3: Using the Length of \( XY \)
The problem states that \( XY = 7 \). Since \( XY \) is a midsegment of \( \triangle RST \):
\[
XY = \frac{1}{2} ST
\]
Thus:
\[
7 = \frac{1}{2} ST
\]
Solving for \( ST \):
\[
ST = 7 \times 2 = 14
\]

#### Step 4: Verifying the Solution
- \( XY \) is indeed a midsegment, so \( XY = \frac{1}{2} ST \).
- Substituting \( ST = 14 \) confirms:
  \[
  XY = \frac{1}{2} \times 14 = 7
  \]
This matches the given value of \( XY \).

### Solution:
Based on the calculations and the Midsegment Theorem, the length of \( ST \) is:
\[
\boxed{14}
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
