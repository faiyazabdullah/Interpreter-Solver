### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
The image shows a geometric figure with the following details:
- Points \( R \), \( S \), and \( T \) form a horizontal line segment \( RT \).
- \( RS = ST = 7 \). This indicates that \( S \) is the midpoint of \( RT \).
- There is a perpendicular line segment \( QS \) drawn from point \( Q \) to the line \( RT \).
- The lengths of the segments \( RQ \) and \( TQ \) are given as expressions involving \( x \):
  - \( RQ = x + 3 \)
  - \( TQ = 2x - 6 \)

#### Step 2: Understand What Needs to Be Found
We need to find the length \( TQ \). To do this, we first need to determine the value of \( x \) using the given information.

#### Step 3: Use Geometric Properties
Since \( S \) is the midpoint of \( RT \), the triangle \( RQT \) is symmetric about the perpendicular \( QS \). This means that \( RQ = TQ \) because \( QS \) is the perpendicular bisector of \( RT \).

#### Step 4: Set Up the Equation
From the symmetry, we have:
\[ RQ = TQ \]
Substitute the given expressions for \( RQ \) and \( TQ \):
\[ x + 3 = 2x - 6 \]

#### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)
Rearrange the equation to solve for \( x \):
\[ x + 3 = 2x - 6 \]
\[ 3 + 6 = 2x - x \]
\[ 9 = x \]

#### Step 6: Calculate \( TQ \)
Now that we have \( x = 9 \), substitute \( x \) into the expression for \( TQ \):
\[ TQ = 2x - 6 \]
\[ TQ = 2(9) - 6 \]
\[ TQ = 18 - 6 \]
\[ TQ = 12 \]

#### Step 7: Verify the Solution
We have \( RQ = x + 3 = 9 + 3 = 12 \) and \( TQ = 2x - 6 = 12 \). Since \( RQ = TQ \), the symmetry is consistent, and our solution is correct.

### Solution Section

Based on the calculations, the length of \( TQ \) is:
\[ TQ = 12 \]

Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 6
- B. 7
- C. 12
- D. 18

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{C} \]
