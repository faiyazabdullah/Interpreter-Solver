### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a geometric figure with several labeled points and line segments. The key elements are:
- Line segment \( MN \) is perpendicular to line segment \( NP \).
- Line segment \( MQ \) is perpendicular to line segment \( QA \).
- The lengths of the segments \( MQ \) and \( QA \) are given as algebraic expressions:
  - \( MQ = 2x + 2 \)
  - \( QA = 4x - 8 \)

The task is to find the length of \( QM \), which is the same as \( MQ \).

### Thought Section:
1. **Identify Given Information:**
   - \( MQ = 2x + 2 \)
   - \( QA = 4x - 8 \)
   - Both \( MQ \) and \( QA \) are perpendicular segments, forming right angles at \( Q \).

2. **Understand the Relationship:**
   - Since \( MQ \) and \( QA \) are part of the same figure and share the point \( Q \), we need to determine the value of \( x \) to find the exact lengths of these segments.

3. **Set Up an Equation:**
   - The problem does not provide a direct relationship between \( MQ \) and \( QA \). However, since both are expressed in terms of \( x \), we can assume that the values of \( MQ \) and \( QA \) must be consistent with the geometric constraints of the figure.
   - A common approach is to use the fact that the lengths must be positive and satisfy the given algebraic expressions.

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - To find \( x \), we need additional information or constraints. Since the problem does not provide explicit constraints, we will assume that the expressions \( MQ \) and \( QA \) are valid for some positive \( x \).

5. **Calculate \( QM \):**
   - Once \( x \) is determined, substitute it back into the expression for \( MQ \) to find the length of \( QM \).

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Ensure that the calculated value of \( QM \) matches one of the given answer choices.

### Solution Section:
#### Step 1: Solve for \( x \)
- Since the problem does not provide additional constraints, we assume that the expressions \( MQ = 2x + 2 \) and \( QA = 4x - 8 \) are valid for some positive \( x \).
- To find \( x \), we need to ensure that both expressions are positive:
  - \( 2x + 2 > 0 \)
  - \( 4x - 8 > 0 \)

1. Solve \( 2x + 2 > 0 \):
   \[
   2x + 2 > 0 \implies 2x > -2 \implies x > -1
   \]

2. Solve \( 4x - 8 > 0 \):
   \[
   4x - 8 > 0 \implies 4x > 8 \implies x > 2
   \]

From these inequalities, the valid range for \( x \) is \( x > 2 \).

#### Step 2: Choose a Valid Value for \( x \)
- Since \( x > 2 \), let's choose \( x = 3 \) (a simple integer greater than 2) to find \( QM \).

#### Step 3: Calculate \( QM \)
- Substitute \( x = 3 \) into the expression for \( MQ \):
  \[
  MQ = 2x + 2 = 2(3) + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8
  \]

#### Step 4: Verify the Calculation
- Substitute \( x = 3 \) into the expression for \( QA \) to ensure consistency:
  \[
  QA = 4x - 8 = 4(3) - 8 = 12 - 8 = 4
  \]
- Both \( MQ = 8 \) and \( QA = 4 \) are positive and consistent with the given expressions.

#### Final Answer:
The length of \( QM \) is \( 8 \).

\[
\boxed{B}
\]
