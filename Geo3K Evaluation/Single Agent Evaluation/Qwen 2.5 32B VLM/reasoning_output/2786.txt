### Problem Analysis:
The given image shows a geometric figure with several key elements:
1. **Triangle \( \triangle WXY \)**: A large triangle with vertices \( W \), \( X \), and \( Y \).
2. **Point \( Z \)**: A point on the base \( WY \) such that \( Z \) is the midpoint of \( WY \).
3. **Point \( A \)**: A point below \( Z \) such that \( AZ \perp WY \).
4. **Point \( X \)**: The vertex of the triangle, with \( XZ \perp WY \).
5. **Segment \( XY = 12 \)**: The length of one side of the triangle is given.
6. **Perpendicular segments**: \( XZ \perp WY \) and \( AZ \perp WY \).

The goal is to find the length of segment \( XW \).

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry
- Since \( XZ \perp WY \) and \( Z \) is the midpoint of \( WY \), \( XZ \) is the altitude of \( \triangle WXY \) from vertex \( X \) to the base \( WY \).
- The perpendicularity of \( XZ \) and \( AZ \) implies that \( XZ \) and \( AZ \) are both vertical lines relative to the horizontal base \( WY \).

#### Step 2: Identifying Key Properties
- \( Z \) being the midpoint of \( WY \) means \( WZ =ZY \). Let \( WZ = ZY = d \). Therefore, \( WY = 2d \).
- Since \( XZ \perp WY \), \( \triangle WXZ \) and \( \triangle XYZ \) are right triangles.
- The given length \( XY = 12 \) is the hypotenuse of \( \triangle XYZ \).

#### Step 3: Using Symmetry and Right Triangles
- Because \( Z \) is the midpoint, \( \triangle WXZ \) and \( \triangle XYZ \) are congruent by symmetry. This implies:
  - \( XW = XY \) (since \( WZ = ZY \) and the triangles are symmetric).
  - Therefore, \( XW = 12 \).

#### Step 4: Verifying the Solution
- The problem does not provide additional measurements for \( WZ \) or \( ZY \), but the symmetry and congruence of the triangles allow us to conclude that \( XW = XY \).
- Given \( XY = 12 \), it follows directly that \( XW = 12 \).

#### Step 5: Comparing with Answer Choices
- The calculated value of \( XW \) is \( 12 \).
- The answer choices are:
  - A. 6
  - B. 12
  - C. 18
  - D. 24
- The closest match is \( 12 \).

---

### Solution Section:

Based on the analysis and symmetry of the triangle, the length of \( XW \) is equal to the length of \( XY \), which is given as 12. Therefore, the correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{B}
\]
