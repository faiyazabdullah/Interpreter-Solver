### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
- The image shows a rectangle with dimensions:
  - Length = 30 cm
  - Width = 20 cm
- Four congruent right triangles are cut off from each corner of the rectangle to form an octagon.
- Each triangle has legs of length 6 cm (as indicated in the image).

#### Step 2: Understand the Geometry of the Triangles
- Each triangle is a right triangle with legs of 6 cm each.
- The area of one such triangle can be calculated using the formula for the area of a right triangle:
  \[
  \text{Area of one triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times 6 = 18 \text{ cm}^2
  \]

#### Step 3: Calculate the Total Area of the Four Triangles
- Since there are four congruent triangles, the total area of the four triangles is:
  \[
  \text{Total area of four triangles} = 4 \times 18 = 72 \text{ cm}^2
  \]

#### Step 4: Calculate the Area of the Original Rectangle
- The area of the original rectangle is:
  \[
  \text{Area of rectangle} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 30 \times 20 = 600 \text{ cm}^2
  \]

#### Step 5: Calculate the Area of the Octagon
- The area of the octagon is the area of the original rectangle minus the total area of the four triangles:
  \[
  \text{Area of octagon} = \text{Area of rectangle} - \text{Total area of four triangles} = 600 - 72 = 528 \text{ cm}^2
  \]

#### Step 6: Verify the Calculation
- The dimensions and the process are consistent with the given information.
- The subtraction of the areas is straightforward and logical.

#### Step 7: Compare with Answer Choices
- The calculated area of the octagon is 528 cmÂ².
- The answer choices are:
  - A. 456
  - B. 528
  - C. 552
  - D. 564
- The calculated value matches option B.
