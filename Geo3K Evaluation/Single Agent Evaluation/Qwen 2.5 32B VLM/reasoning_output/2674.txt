### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the given information
- We are working with a circle centered at \( F \) (denoted as \(\odot F\)).
- The measure of \(\angle DFA\) is given as \(50^\circ\).
- Line segment \( CF \) is perpendicular to line segment \( FB \), i.e., \( CF \perp FB \).

#### Step 2: Identify what needs to be found
- We need to find the measure of the arc \(\widehat{ACE}\).

#### Step 3: Use geometric properties and theorems
1. **Central Angle and Arc Relationship**: The measure of an arc is equal to the measure of its central angle.
2. **Perpendicular Lines**: Since \( CF \perp FB \), \(\angle CFB = 90^\circ\).
3. **Sum of Angles in a Circle**: The total measure of the circumference of a circle is \(360^\circ\).

#### Step 4: Break down the problem
- The arc \(\widehat{ACE}\) can be thought of as the sum of arcs \(\widehat{AC}\) and \(\widehat{CE}\).
- To find \(\widehat{ACE}\), we need to determine the measures of \(\widehat{AC}\) and \(\widehat{CE}\) separately or directly.

#### Step 5: Use the given angle \(\angle DFA\)
- \(\angle DFA\) is an inscribed angle that subtends arc \(\widehat{DA}\).
- The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Therefore:
  \[
  \text{Measure of } \widehat{DA} = 2 \times \text{Measure of } \angle DFA = 2 \times 50^\circ = 100^\circ.
  \]

#### Step 6: Use the perpendicular relationship \( CF \perp FB \)
- Since \( CF \perp FB \), \(\angle CFB = 90^\circ\). This means that arc \(\widehat{CB}\) is a semicircle, and its measure is \(180^\circ\).

#### Step 7: Determine the measure of arc \(\widehat{ACE}\)
- The arc \(\widehat{ACE}\) is the remaining part of the circle after removing arc \(\widehat{DA}\) and arc \(\widehat{CB}\).
- The total measure of the circle is \(360^\circ\). Therefore:
  \[
  \text{Measure of } \widehat{ACE} = 360^\circ - \text{Measure of } \widehat{DA} - \text{Measure of } \widehat{CB}.
  \]
- Substituting the known values:
  \[
  \text{Measure of } \widehat{ACE} = 360^\circ - 100^\circ - 180^\circ = 80^\circ + 180^\circ = 230^\circ.
  \]

### Solution Section

Based on the above reasoning, the measure of arc \(\widehat{ACE}\) is \(230^\circ\).
