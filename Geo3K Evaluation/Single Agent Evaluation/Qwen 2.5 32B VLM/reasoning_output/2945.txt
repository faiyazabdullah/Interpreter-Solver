### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the given information
- The image shows a circle with several points labeled: \( H, J, G, K, F, A, B, C \).
- Angles are marked at specific locations:
  - \( \angle HKJ = 26^\circ \)
  - \( \angle KJC = 88^\circ \)
- We need to find \( m\angle H \), which appears to be the angle at point \( H \) formed by the tangents to the circle at points \( H \) and \( J \).

#### Step 2: Identify relevant geometric properties
- **Tangent-Secant Angle Theorem**: If a tangent and a secant (or chord) intersect outside a circle, the measure of the angle formed is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs.
- **Central Angle and Inscribed Angle Theorem**: An inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.

#### Step 3: Determine the relationship between the angles
- The angle \( \angle HKJ = 26^\circ \) is an angle formed by a tangent at \( H \) and a chord \( JK \).
- The angle \( \angle KJC = 88^\circ \) is an angle formed by a tangent at \( K \) and a chord \( JC \).

#### Step 4: Use the Tangent-Secant Angle Theorem
- The angle \( \angle H \) is formed by the tangents at points \( H \) and \( J \). According to the Tangent-Tangent Angle Theorem, the measure of the angle formed by two tangents drawn to a circle from an external point is equal to half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs.
- Let the intercepted arcs be \( \overset{\frown}{HF} \) and \( \overset{\frown}{JK} \).

#### Step 5: Calculate the measure of \( \angle H \)
- The measure of \( \angle H \) can be found using the formula:
  \[
  m\angle H = \frac{1}{2} \left( \text{Measure of arc } \overset{\frown}{HKJ} - \text{Measure of arc } \overset{\frown}{KJC} \right)
  \]
- From the given angles:
  - \( \angle HKJ = 26^\circ \)
  - \( \angle KJC = 88^\circ \)
- The measure of the arc \( \overset{\frown}{HKJ} \) is twice the measure of \( \angle HKJ \):
  \[
  \text{Measure of arc } \overset{\frown}{HKJ} = 2 \times 26^\circ = 52^\circ
  \]
- The measure of the arc \( \overset{\frown}{KJC} \) is twice the measure of \( \angle KJC \):
  \[
  \text{Measure of arc } \overset{\frown}{KJC} = 2 \times 88^\circ = 176^\circ
  \]
- Therefore, the measure of \( \angle H \) is:
  \[
  m\angle H = \frac{1}{2} \left( 176^\circ - 52^\circ \right) = \frac{1}{2} \times 124^\circ = 62^\circ
  \]

### Solution Section

Based on the calculations:
- The measure of \( \angle H \) is \( 62^\circ \).

Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 26
- B. 31
- C. 62
- D. 88

The correct answer is \( 62 \).
