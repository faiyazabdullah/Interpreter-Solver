### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the measure of \( \angle ADB \) in a rhombus \( ABCD \). The problem provides the following information:
1. \( m\angle DAB = 2 \cdot m\angle ADC \).
2. \( CB = 6 \) (which is the side length of the rhombus since all sides are equal).
3. The geometric figure shows diagonals intersecting at point \( E \), which is the midpoint of both diagonals due to the properties of a rhombus.

#### Key Properties of a Rhombus:
- All sides are equal.
- Diagonals bisect each other at right angles.
- Diagonals bisect the angles of the rhombus.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Understand the Angle Relationship
We are given that \( m\angle DAB = 2 \cdot m\angle ADC \). Let \( m\angle ADC = x \). Then:
\[ m\angle DAB = 2x. \]

#### Step 2: Use the Sum of Interior Angles in a Rhombus
In a rhombus, opposite angles are equal, and the sum of the interior angles is \( 360^\circ \). Therefore:
\[ m\angle DAB + m\angle ABC + m\angle BCD + m\angle CDA = 360^\circ. \]
Since \( m\angle DAB = 2x \) and \( m\angle ADC = x \), and opposite angles are equal:
\[ m\angle DAB = m\angle BCD = 2x, \]
\[ m\angle ADC = m\angle ABC = x. \]
Thus:
\[ 2x + x + 2x + x = 360^\circ. \]
Simplify:
\[ 6x = 360^\circ. \]
\[ x = 60^\circ. \]
So:
\[ m\angle DAB = 2x = 120^\circ, \]
\[ m\angle ADC = x = 60^\circ. \]

#### Step 3: Use the Diagonal Properties
The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles (\( 90^\circ \)) and bisect the angles of the rhombus. Therefore:
- \( \angle DAB \) is bisected by diagonal \( DB \), so:
\[ m\angle DAB = 120^\circ \implies m\angle DAE = m\angle EAB = \frac{120^\circ}{2} = 60^\circ. \]
- Similarly, \( \angle ADC \) is bisected by diagonal \( AC \), so:
\[ m\angle ADC = 60^\circ \implies m\angle DAE = m\angle EDC = \frac{60^\circ}{2} = 30^\circ. \]

#### Step 4: Find \( m\angle ADB \)
Since the diagonals intersect at right angles (\( 90^\circ \)), we can use the fact that \( \angle ADB \) is part of the right triangle formed by the diagonals. Specifically, \( \angle ADB \) is one of the angles in the right triangle \( \triangle ADE \) where:
\[ m\angle AED = 90^\circ, \]
\[ m\angle DAE = 60^\circ. \]
Thus:
\[ m\angle ADB = 90^\circ - m\angle DAE = 90^\circ - 60^\circ = 30^\circ. \]

### Final Answer:
The measure of \( \angle ADB \) is \( 30^\circ \).

\[ \boxed{A} \]
