### Problem Analysis:
We are given a geometric figure with several line segments and points labeled. The problem provides specific lengths and expressions for some segments:
- \( AC = x - 3 \)
- \( BE = 20 \)
- \( AB = 16 \)
- \( CD = x + 5 \)

We need to find the value of \( CD \). To do this, we will analyze the relationships between the given segments and use algebra to solve for \( x \).

---

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Relationships**
From the image:
- \( AC \) and \( AB \) are segments on the same line.
- \( BE \) is a segment extending from point \( B \).
- \( CD \) is a segment extending from point \( D \).

The key observation is that \( AC \), \( AB \), and \( BE \) form a straight line, suggesting that \( AC + AB = BE \). This relationship will help us solve for \( x \).

#### **Step 2: Set Up the Equation**
Given:
- \( AC = x - 3 \)
- \( AB = 16 \)
- \( BE = 20 \)

Since \( AC \) and \( AB \) are consecutive segments on the same line, their sum equals \( BE \):
\[
AC + AB = BE
\]

Substitute the given values:
\[
(x - 3) + 16 = 20
\]

#### **Step 3: Solve for \( x \)**
Simplify the equation:
\[
x - 3 + 16 = 20
\]
\[
x + 13 = 20
\]
\[
x = 20 - 13
\]
\[
x = 7
\]

#### **Step 4: Find \( CD \)**
The expression for \( CD \) is given as:
\[
CD = x + 5
\]

Substitute \( x = 7 \) into the expression:
\[
CD = 7 + 5
\]
\[
CD = 12
\]

#### **Step 5: Verify the Solution**
Recheck the calculations:
- \( AC = x - 3 = 7 - 3 = 4 \)
- \( AB = 16 \)
- \( BE = 20 \)
- \( AC + AB = 4 + 16 = 20 \), which matches \( BE \).

The calculations are consistent with the given information.

#### **Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**
The calculated value of \( CD \) is \( 12 \). However, none of the answer choices (A. 32, B. 35, C. 36, D. 40) match this value. This suggests there may be an error in interpreting the problem or the image. Upon re-examining the image and problem statement, it appears the relationships might involve additional geometric properties not initially considered. However, based on the given information and standard geometric principles, the derived value of \( CD \) is correct.

Since the problem explicitly states to select one of the provided options, and none match the calculated value, we must conclude there is a discrepancy. However, following the instruction to select the closest option, none of the provided answers are valid under the current interpretation.

---

### Final Answer:
Given the constraints and the provided answer choices, the problem seems to contain an inconsistency. However, strictly adhering to the instructions to select one of the provided options, we must conclude there is no valid match. If forced to choose, the problem setup may need reevaluation.
