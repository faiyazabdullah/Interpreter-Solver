### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a geometric configuration involving a square (ABCD) and several line segments. The key elements are:
- A square ABCD.
- Points \( Q \) and \( Q' \) on the base \( DC \).
- Line segments connecting points in the square, forming smaller geometric shapes.
- The distance between \( Q \) and \( C \) is given as 5 units.
- The total length of \( DQ' \) is given as 15 units.

We are tasked with finding the **scale factor** from \( Q \) to \( Q' \). This implies determining how the position of \( Q \) relates to the position of \( Q' \) along the base \( DC \).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### 1. Understanding the Geometry:
- The base \( DC \) of the square is divided into segments by points \( Q \) and \( Q' \).
- The distance \( QC = 5 \) units.
- The total length \( DQ' = 15 \) units.

#### 2. Relating \( Q \) and \( Q' \):
- Since \( Q \) and \( Q' \) are both on the base \( DC \), we can express their positions relative to \( D \):
  - Let \( DQ = x \).
  - Then \( QC = DC - DQ = 5 \).

#### 3. Calculating \( DC \):
- The total length of the base \( DC \) is the sum of \( DQ \) and \( QC \):
  \[
  DC = DQ + QC = x + 5
  \]

#### 4. Using the Given Information for \( Q' \):
- The total length \( DQ' = 15 \) units.
- Since \( Q' \) is also on the base \( DC \), it must satisfy the same linear relationship as \( Q \).

#### 5. Determining the Scale Factor:
- The scale factor from \( Q \) to \( Q' \) is the ratio of the distances \( DQ' \) to \( DQ \):
  \[
  \text{Scale factor} = \frac{DQ'}{DQ}
  \]
- From the given information:
  \[
  DQ' = 15 \quad \text{and} \quad DQ = x
  \]
- However, we need to relate \( x \) to the known segment lengths. Notice that the configuration suggests a proportional relationship between the segments \( DQ \) and \( DQ' \).

#### 6. Observing Proportional Relationships:
- The image suggests that the configuration is symmetric and involves similar triangles or proportional segments.
- Since \( Q' \) is 15 units from \( D \) and \( Q \) is \( x \) units from \( D \), the scale factor can be directly calculated as:
  \[
  \text{Scale factor} = \frac{15}{x}
  \]

#### 7. Solving for \( x \):
- From the image, the relationship between \( Q \) and \( Q' \) suggests that \( Q' \) is three times further from \( D \) than \( Q \). This is because the configuration implies a consistent scaling of distances along the base \( DC \).

#### 8. Verifying the Scale Factor:
- If \( Q' \) is three times further from \( D \) than \( Q \), then:
  \[
  DQ' = 3 \times DQ
  \]
- Given \( DQ' = 15 \):
  \[
  15 = 3 \times DQ \implies DQ = 5
  \]
- This confirms that the scale factor is indeed 3.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
