### Problem Analysis:
The image shows an isosceles triangle \( \triangle XYZ \) with the following details:
- \( XY = 2x + 3 \)
- \( YZ = 4x - 1 \)
- \( XZ = 8x - 4 \)

Since \( \triangle XYZ \) is isosceles, two sides must be equal. We need to determine which two sides are equal and solve for \( x \). Once we find \( x \), we can calculate the length of \( XY \).

---

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Identify the isosceles property
An isosceles triangle has two equal sides. Therefore, we have three possible cases:
1. \( XY = YZ \)
2. \( XY = XZ \)
3. \( YZ = XZ \)

We will test each case to determine which one is valid.

#### Step 2: Case 1: \( XY = YZ \)
If \( XY = YZ \), then:
\[
2x + 3 = 4x - 1
\]
Solving for \( x \):
\[
2x + 3 = 4x - 1 \implies 3 + 1 = 4x - 2x \implies 4 = 2x \implies x = 2
\]

Now, we check if this value of \( x \) makes sense for all sides:
- \( XY = 2x + 3 = 2(2) + 3 = 7 \)
- \( YZ = 4x - 1 = 4(2) - 1 = 7 \)
- \( XZ = 8x - 4 = 8(2) - 4 = 12 \)

Here, \( XY = YZ = 7 \), so this case is valid.

#### Step 3: Case 2: \( XY = XZ \)
If \( XY = XZ \), then:
\[
2x + 3 = 8x - 4
\]
Solving for \( x \):
\[
2x + 3 = 8x - 4 \implies 3 + 4 = 8x - 2x \implies 7 = 6x \implies x = \frac{7}{6}
\]

Now, we check if this value of \( x \) makes sense for all sides:
- \( XY = 2x + 3 = 2\left(\frac{7}{6}\right) + 3 = \frac{14}{6} + 3 = \frac{14}{6} + \frac{18}{6} = \frac{32}{6} = \frac{16}{3} \)
- \( YZ = 4x - 1 = 4\left(\frac{7}{6}\right) - 1 = \frac{28}{6} - 1 = \frac{28}{6} - \frac{6}{6} = \frac{22}{6} = \frac{11}{3} \)
- \( XZ = 8x - 4 = 8\left(\frac{7}{6}\right) - 4 = \frac{56}{6} - 4 = \frac{56}{6} - \frac{24}{6} = \frac{32}{6} = \frac{16}{3} \)

Here, \( XY = XZ = \frac{16}{3} \), but \( YZ = \frac{11}{3} \), which does not satisfy the isosceles condition with \( YZ \) being different. So, this case is invalid.

#### Step 4: Case 3: \( YZ = XZ \)
If \( YZ = XZ \), then:
\[
4x - 1 = 8x - 4
\]
Solving for \( x \):
\[
4x - 1 = 8x - 4 \implies -1 + 4 = 8x - 4x \implies 3 = 4x \implies x = \frac{3}{4}
\]

Now, we check if this value of \( x \) makes sense for all sides:
- \( XY = 2x + 3 = 2\left(\frac{3}{4}\right) + 3 = \frac{6}{4} + 3 = \frac{6}{4} + \frac{12}{4} = \frac{18}{4} = \frac{9}{2} \)
- \( YZ = 4x - 1 = 4\left(\frac{3}{4}\right) - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2 \)
- \( XZ = 8x - 4 = 8\left(\frac{3}{4}\right) - 4 = 6 - 4 = 2 \)

Here, \( YZ = XZ = 2 \), but \( XY = \frac{9}{2} \), which does not satisfy the isosceles condition with \( XY \) being different. So, this case is invalid.

#### Step 5: Conclusion from valid cases
From the valid case (Case 1), we have \( x = 2 \) and \( XY = 7 \).

---

### Solution Section:

The only valid case is when \( XY = YZ \), which gives \( x = 2 \) and \( XY = 7 \).

Thus, the length of \( XY \) is \( 7 \).
