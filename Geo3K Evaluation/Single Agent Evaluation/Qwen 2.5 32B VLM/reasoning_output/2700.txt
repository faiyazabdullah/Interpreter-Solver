### Problem Analysis:
The image depicts a quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with specific measurements and angles. Here's a breakdown of the given information:
- \(AB = 15 \, \text{mm}\)
- \(BC = 15 \, \text{mm}\)
- \(\angle ABC = 30^\circ\)
- \(AD \perp AB\) (indicated by the right angle symbol at \(A\))
- The shape appears to be a trapezoid with \(AB\) and \(DC\) as parallel sides.

The goal is to find the area of the quadrilateral \(ABCD\).

---

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Identify the Shape and Key Measurements
The quadrilateral \(ABCD\) has the following characteristics:
- \(AB\) and \(DC\) are parallel (as indicated by the trapezoid structure).
- \(AB = DC = 15 \, \text{mm}\) (since opposite sides of the trapezoid are equal in length).
- \(\angle ABC = 30^\circ\), which helps determine the height of the trapezoid.
- \(AD\) is perpendicular to \(AB\), meaning \(AD\) is one of the legs of the right triangle formed by extending \(AD\) to meet \(BC\).

#### Step 2: Determine the Height of the Trapezoid
To find the height of the trapezoid, we need to analyze the right triangle formed by extending \(AD\) to meet \(BC\). Letâ€™s denote the height of the trapezoid as \(h\).

From the right triangle involving \(\angle ABC = 30^\circ\):
- The side opposite \(\angle ABC\) (which is part of the base \(BC\)) is \(15 \, \text{mm}\).
- The height \(h\) can be found using trigonometry in the right triangle formed by dropping a perpendicular from \(D\) to \(BC\).

In the right triangle:
\[
\sin(30^\circ) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{h}{15}
\]
Since \(\sin(30^\circ) = \frac{1}{2}\):
\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{h}{15} \implies h = 15 \times \frac{1}{2} = 7.5 \, \text{mm}
\]

#### Step 3: Calculate the Area of the Trapezoid
The area \(A\) of a trapezoid is given by the formula:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times (b_1 + b_2) \times h
\]
where \(b_1\) and \(b_2\) are the lengths of the parallel sides, and \(h\) is the height.

Here:
- \(b_1 = AB = 15 \, \text{mm}\)
- \(b_2 = DC = 15 \, \text{mm}\)
- \(h = 7.5 \, \text{mm}\)

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times (15 + 15) \times 7.5 = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 \times 7.5 = 15 \times 7.5 = 112.5 \, \text{mm}^2
\]

#### Step 4: Verify the Calculation
The calculation is consistent with the given dimensions and the properties of the trapezoid. The height \(h = 7.5 \, \text{mm}\) is derived correctly from the \(30^\circ\) angle, and the area formula for the trapezoid is applied accurately.

#### Step 5: Match the Result with Answer Choices
The calculated area is \(112.5 \, \text{mm}^2\), which matches option B.

The area of the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is:
\[
\boxed{112.5}
\]
