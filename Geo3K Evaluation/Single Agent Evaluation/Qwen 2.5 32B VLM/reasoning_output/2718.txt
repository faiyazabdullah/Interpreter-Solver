### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a geometric figure with several key elements:
1. **Angle Measures**:
   - $\angle E = 25^\circ$
   - $\angle G = 90^\circ$ (right angle)
   - $\angle F = 65^\circ$

2. **Lines and Segments**:
   - Line $EG$ is horizontal.
   - Line $ED$ intersects $EF$ at point $D$.
   - Line $DF$ forms a triangle $DEF$ with $\angle F = 65^\circ$.

3. **Objective**:
   - Find the measure of $\angle 1$, which is the angle between line $ED$ and the vertical line through point $D$.

### Thought Section:
#### Step 1: Identify Key Relationships
- Since $\angle G = 90^\circ$, triangle $DEF$ is a right triangle with $\angle G$ as the right angle.
- The sum of the angles in any triangle is $180^\circ$. Therefore, we can use this property to find missing angles in triangle $DEF$.

#### Step 2: Calculate $\angle D$ in Triangle $DEF$
- In triangle $DEF$, the angles are:
  - $\angle E = 25^\circ$
  - $\angle F = 65^\circ$
  - Let $\angle D$ be the unknown angle at vertex $D$.
- Using the angle sum property of a triangle:
  $$
  \angle D + \angle E + \angle F = 180^\circ
  $$
  Substituting the known values:
  $$
  \angle D + 25^\circ + 65^\circ = 180^\circ
  $$
  Simplify:
  $$
  \angle D + 90^\circ = 180^\circ
  $$
  $$
  \angle D = 90^\circ
  $$

#### Step 3: Relate $\angle 1$ to $\angle D$
- $\angle 1$ is the angle formed by line $ED$ and the vertical line through point $D$.
- Since $\angle D$ is the interior angle at $D$ in triangle $DEF$, and the vertical line through $D$ is perpendicular to the horizontal line $EG$, $\angle 1$ is the complement of the angle between $ED$ and the horizontal line $EG$.
- The angle between $ED$ and the horizontal line $EG$ is $25^\circ$ (given as $\angle E$).
- Therefore, $\angle 1$ is the difference between $90^\circ$ (the vertical line) and $25^\circ$:
  $$
  \angle 1 = 90^\circ - 25^\circ = 65^\circ
  $$

### Solution Section:
From the analysis above, we have determined that:
- $\angle 1 = 65^\circ$.

Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 25
- B. 55
- C. 65
- D. 75

The correct answer is $65^\circ$.

### Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{C}
$$
