### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the length of \( VS \) in the trapezoid \( TRSV \), where:
- \( TR \) is one base of the trapezoid with length \( TR = 32 \).
- \( MN \) is the midsegment (median) of the trapezoid, connecting the midpoints of the non-parallel sides (legs) \( TV \) and \( SR \), with length \( MN = 25 \).
- We need to determine the length of the other base \( VS \).

#### Key Concepts:
1. **Midsegment of a Trapezoid**: The midsegment (or median) of a trapezoid is parallel to the bases and its length is the average of the lengths of the two bases. Mathematically:
   \[
   MN = \frac{TR + VS}{2}
   \]
2. **Given Information**:
   - \( TR = 32 \)
   - \( MN = 25 \)
   - We need to find \( VS \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Use the Midsegment Formula
The formula for the midsegment \( MN \) of a trapezoid is:
\[
MN = \frac{TR + VS}{2}
\]
Substitute the given values \( TR = 32 \) and \( MN = 25 \):
\[
25 = \frac{32 + VS}{2}
\]

#### Step 2: Solve for \( VS \)
To isolate \( VS \), first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:
\[
2 \cdot 25 = 32 + VS
\]
\[
50 = 32 + VS
\]
Next, subtract 32 from both sides:
\[
VS = 50 - 32
\]
\[
VS = 18
\]

#### Step 3: Verify the Solution
We have calculated \( VS = 18 \). Let's verify by substituting back into the midsegment formula:
\[
MN = \frac{TR + VS}{2} = \frac{32 + 18}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25
\]
The calculation is consistent with the given value of \( MN = 25 \).

### Final Answer:
The length of \( VS \) is \( 18 \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 18
- B. 36
- C. 50
- D. 64

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]

Final Answer: A
