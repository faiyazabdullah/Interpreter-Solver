### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the distance \( JK \), the distance between the centers of two circles, given the following information:
- Circle \( J \) has a radius of 10 units.
- Circle \( K \) has a radius of 8 units.
- The length of the segment \( BC \) is 5.4 units.
- The circles intersect at points \( B \) and \( C \).

From the image, we can observe:
1. Circle \( J \) is centered at \( J \) with radius 10.
2. Circle \( K \) is centered at \( K \) with radius 8.
3. The segment \( BC \) is common to both circles and lies within the overlapping region.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**
The distance between the centers of two intersecting circles (\( J \) and \( K \)) can be found using the formula for the distance between the centers of two circles when they intersect:
\[
JK = \sqrt{r_1^2 + r_2^2 - 2r_1r_2 \cos \theta}
\]
where:
- \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \) are the radii of the circles.
- \( \theta \) is the angle subtended by the chord \( BC \) at the center of each circle.

However, since we do not have the angle \( \theta \), we can use an alternative approach involving the perpendicular distance from the centers to the chord \( BC \).

#### **Step 2: Use the Perpendicular Distance Formula**
When two circles intersect, the line segment joining their centers (\( JK \)) is perpendicular to the common chord (\( BC \)) at its midpoint. Let \( M \) be the midpoint of \( BC \). Then:
- \( BM = MC = \frac{BC}{2} = \frac{5.4}{2} = 2.7 \) units.

#### **Step 3: Calculate the Perpendicular Distances**
Let \( d_1 \) be the perpendicular distance from \( J \) to the chord \( BC \), and \( d_2 \) be the perpendicular distance from \( K \) to the chord \( BC \). Using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangles formed:
1. For circle \( J \):
\[
d_1 = \sqrt{r_1^2 - BM^2} = \sqrt{10^2 - 2.7^2} = \sqrt{100 - 7.29} = \sqrt{92.71}
\]

2. For circle \( K \):
\[
d_2 = \sqrt{r_2^2 - BM^2} = \sqrt{8^2 - 2.7^2} = \sqrt{64 - 7.29} = \sqrt{56.71}
\]

#### **Step 4: Calculate the Distance \( JK \)**
The distance \( JK \) is the sum of the perpendicular distances \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \):
\[
JK = d_1 + d_2 = \sqrt{92.71} + \sqrt{56.71}
\]

Calculate the numerical values:
\[
\sqrt{92.71} \approx 9.63
\]
\[
\sqrt{56.71} \approx 7.53
\]
\[
JK \approx 9.63 + 7.53 = 17.16
\]

#### **Step 5: Compare with the Answer Choices**
The calculated value \( JK \approx 17.16 \) is closest to the answer choice \( 14.6 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
