### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the measure of \( \angle 5 \) in the quadrilateral \( WXYZ \), which is given to be a rectangle. The problem provides the measure of \( \angle 1 \) as \( 30^\circ \). We need to use geometric properties and relationships to determine \( \angle 5 \).

#### Key Observations from the Image:
1. **Quadrilateral \( WXYZ \)** is a rectangle. This means:
   - All interior angles are \( 90^\circ \).
   - Opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.
2. The diagonals \( WX \) and \( YZ \) intersect at point \( A \), which is the midpoint of both diagonals (a property of rectangles).
3. The angles labeled \( \angle 1, \angle 5, \angle 9, \angle 10, \angle 11, \angle 12 \) are formed by the intersection of the diagonals and the sides of the rectangle.

#### Given:
- \( m\angle 1 = 30^\circ \).

#### Objective:
Find \( m\angle 5 \).

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Understand the Properties of a Rectangle
- In a rectangle, the diagonals are congruent and bisect each other.
- The diagonals divide the rectangle into four triangles, and the angles formed at the intersection of the diagonals have specific relationships due to the symmetry and right angles of the rectangle.

#### Step 2: Analyze the Angles at the Intersection of Diagonals
- At the intersection point \( A \) of the diagonals \( WX \) and \( YZ \):
  - The diagonals bisect each other, so the triangles formed are isosceles.
  - The angles around point \( A \) sum up to \( 360^\circ \).
  - Since \( WXYZ \) is a rectangle, the diagonals create pairs of congruent angles.

#### Step 3: Identify Relationships Between Angles
- \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 5 \) are alternate interior angles formed by the transversal \( WA \) crossing the parallel sides \( WZ \) and \( XY \).
- In a rectangle, the diagonals create angles that are supplementary to the angles they form with the sides of the rectangle.

#### Step 4: Use the Given Information
- \( m\angle 1 = 30^\circ \).
- Since \( WXYZ \) is a rectangle, \( \angle WXY = 90^\circ \).
- The angle \( \angle 5 \) is part of the triangle \( WAZ \) and is related to \( \angle 1 \) through the properties of the rectangle and the diagonals.

#### Step 5: Determine \( \angle 5 \)
- \( \angle 5 \) is the angle adjacent to \( \angle 1 \) in the triangle formed by the diagonal \( WZ \) and the side \( WY \).
- Since \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 5 \) are part of the same linear pair with the right angle at \( W \), we can use the fact that the diagonals of a rectangle bisect the angles they form with the sides.
- Therefore, \( \angle 5 = \angle 1 = 30^\circ \).

---

### Solution Section:

From the analysis, we conclude that:
- \( \angle 5 \) is equal to \( \angle 1 \) because they are corresponding angles formed by the properties of the rectangle and the diagonals.
- Given \( m\angle 1 = 30^\circ \), it follows that \( m\angle 5 = 30^\circ \).

Thus, the measure of \( \angle 5 \) is \( 30^\circ \).

Final Answer: \( \boxed{B} \)
