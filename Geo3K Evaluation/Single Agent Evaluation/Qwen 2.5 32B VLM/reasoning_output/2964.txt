### Problem Analysis:
The given image contains a geometric figure with several right triangles and parallel lines. Here's a breakdown of the information:

1. **Triangle \( \triangle ADZ \)**:
   - \( \angle DAZ = 30^\circ \)
   - Hypotenuse \( AD = 8 \)

2. **Triangle \( \triangle CBZ \)**:
   - \( \angle CBZ = 45^\circ \)
   - Base \( BC = 4 \) (since \( AB = y + 6 \) and \( AB = 8\sqrt{3} + 4 \), but we'll use the direct relationship later).

3. **Parallel Lines**:
   - \( DZ \parallel FC \)
   - \( ZC \parallel DF \)

4. **Given Lengths**:
   - \( AF = y \)
   - \( FB = 6 \)
   - \( AB = y + 6 \)

We need to find the length \( z \), which is the horizontal distance between points \( D \) and \( Z \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Analyze \( \triangle ADZ \)**
In \( \triangle ADZ \):
- \( \angle DAZ = 30^\circ \)
- \( AD = 8 \)

Using trigonometry in \( \triangle ADZ \):
- The adjacent side \( AZ \) can be found using the cosine function:
  \[
  \cos(30^\circ) = \frac{AZ}{AD} \implies \cos(30^\circ) = \frac{AZ}{8} \implies \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{AZ}{8}
  \]
  \[
  AZ = 8 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 4\sqrt{3}
  \]

- The opposite side \( DZ \) can be found using the sine function:
  \[
  \sin(30^\circ) = \frac{DZ}{AD} \implies \sin(30^\circ) = \frac{DZ}{8} \implies \frac{1}{2} = \frac{DZ}{8}
  \]
  \[
  DZ = 8 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 4
  \]

So, \( DZ = 4 \).

#### **Step 2: Analyze \( \triangle CBZ \)**
In \( \triangle CBZ \):
- \( \angle CBZ = 45^\circ \)
- \( BC = 4 \) (since \( \triangle CBZ \) is a 45-45-90 triangle)

In a 45-45-90 triangle, the legs are equal, and the hypotenuse is \( \sqrt{2} \) times the length of each leg. Therefore:
\[
BZ = BC = 4
\]

#### **Step 3: Determine the Horizontal Distance \( z \)**
From the diagram, \( z \) is the horizontal distance between points \( D \) and \( Z \). Since \( DZ \parallel FC \) and \( ZC \parallel DF \), the horizontal distance \( z \) is simply the sum of the horizontal components from \( D \) to \( Z \).

From the analysis:
- The horizontal component from \( A \) to \( Z \) is \( 4\sqrt{3} \).
- The horizontal distance \( z \) is the same as the length \( DZ \), which is 4.

Thus, \( z = 4 \).

However, upon re-evaluating the problem, it appears there might be a misunderstanding. The correct interpretation should focus on the total horizontal distance from \( D \) to \( Z \), which is consistent with the parallel lines and the given dimensions. The correct value for \( z \) should be re-evaluated based on the overall structure.

#### **Re-evaluation**:
Given the symmetry and the fact that \( DZ \parallel FC \) and \( ZC \parallel DF \), the horizontal distance \( z \) is directly given by the structure of the parallelogram formed. The correct interpretation leads to:
\[
z = 6
\]

\boxed{A}
