### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the length of chord \( AC \) in a circle with center \( G \) and radius 26. The key information provided includes:
1. Chords \( AC \) and \( DF \) are equidistant from the center \( G \).
2. The radius of the circle is 26.
3. The distance from the center \( G \) to the chord \( EF \) is 10 (as indicated by the dashed lines in the diagram).

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Geometry**:
   - The circle has center \( G \) and radius \( r = 26 \).
   - Chords \( AC \) and \( DF \) are equidistant from the center \( G \). This means the perpendicular distances from \( G \) to these chords are equal.
   - The distance from \( G \) to the chord \( EF \) is given as 10. Since \( EF \) is parallel to \( AC \) and \( DF \), the same distance applies to \( AC \) and \( DF \).

2. **Perpendicular Distance from Center to Chord**:
   - Let \( d \) be the perpendicular distance from the center \( G \) to the chord \( AC \). From the problem, \( d = 10 \).
   - The perpendicular from the center to a chord bisects the chord. Therefore, if \( M \) is the midpoint of \( AC \), then \( GM = 10 \) and \( AM = MC \).

3. **Using the Pythagorean Theorem**:
   - Consider the right triangle \( \triangle AGM \):
     - \( AG \) is the radius of the circle, so \( AG = 26 \).
     - \( GM \) is the perpendicular distance from the center to the chord, so \( GM = 10 \).
     - \( AM \) is half the length of the chord \( AC \), so \( AM = \frac{AC}{2} \).
   - By the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle AGM \):
     \[
     AG^2 = AM^2 + GM^2
     \]
     Substituting the known values:
     \[
     26^2 = \left( \frac{AC}{2} \right)^2 + 10^2
     \]
     \[
     676 = \left( \frac{AC}{2} \right)^2 + 100
     \]
     \[
     \left( \frac{AC}{2} \right)^2 = 676 - 100
     \]
     \[
     \left( \frac{AC}{2} \right)^2 = 576
     \]
     \[
     \frac{AC}{2} = \sqrt{576}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{AC}{2} = 24
     \]
     \[
     AC = 2 \times 24 = 48
     \]

4. **Verification**:
   - The calculation is consistent with the Pythagorean theorem and the properties of circles.
   - The distance from the center to the chord is correctly used, and the result matches the geometric constraints.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The length of chord \( AC \) is \( 48 \).

\boxed{D}
