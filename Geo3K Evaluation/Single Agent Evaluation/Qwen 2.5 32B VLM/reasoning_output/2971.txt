### Problem Analysis:
The given image depicts a quadrilateral \(XYZW\) with labeled side lengths. The sides are expressed in terms of variables \(a\) and \(b\):
- \(XY = 3a + 7\)
- \(YZ = 2b\)
- \(ZW = 4a\)
- \(WX = b + 11\)

The task is to determine the value of \(b\) using the properties of a parallelogram. A key property of a parallelogram is that opposite sides are equal in length. Therefore, we can set up equations based on this property.

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Identify the type of quadrilateral
The problem specifies that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram. In a parallelogram:
- Opposite sides are equal: \(XY = ZW\) and \(YZ = WX\).

#### Step 2: Set up equations based on the properties of a parallelogram
From the given side lengths:
1. \(XY = ZW\):
   \[
   3a + 7 = 4a
   \]
2. \(YZ = WX\):
   \[
   2b = b + 11
   \]

#### Step 3: Solve the first equation for \(a\)
From \(3a + 7 = 4a\):
\[
3a + 7 = 4a \implies 7 = 4a - 3a \implies 7 = a
\]
So, \(a = 7\).

#### Step 4: Solve the second equation for \(b\)
From \(2b = b + 11\):
\[
2b = b + 11 \implies 2b - b = 11 \implies b = 11
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the solution
- Substitute \(a = 7\) into the expressions for \(XY\) and \(ZW\):
  \[
  XY = 3a + 7 = 3(7) + 7 = 21 + 7 = 28
  \]
  \[
  ZW = 4a = 4(7) = 28
  \]
  Since \(XY = ZW\), the first condition is satisfied.
- Substitute \(b = 11\) into the expressions for \(YZ\) and \(WX\):
  \[
  YZ = 2b = 2(11) = 22
  \]
  \[
  WX = b + 11 = 11 + 11 = 22
  \]
  Since \(YZ = WX\), the second condition is satisfied.

### Solution Section:

The value of \(b\) is determined to be \(11\). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 7
- B. 11
- C. 21
- D. 33

The correct answer is \(B\).

### Final Answer: B
