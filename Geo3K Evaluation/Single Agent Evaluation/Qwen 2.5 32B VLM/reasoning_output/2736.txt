### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a circle with center \( Z \) and a line segment \( WX \) that is tangent to the circle at point \( Y \). The lengths of segments \( WY \) and \( XY \) are given as expressions involving \( x \):
- \( WY = 2x + 9 \)
- \( XY = 3x + 6 \)

Since \( WX \) is tangent to the circle at \( Y \), the key geometric property to use here is that the tangent segment from a point outside the circle to the point of tangency is equal in length to another tangent segment drawn from the same external point to the circle. However, in this case, we are dealing with a single tangent segment split into two parts, \( WY \) and \( XY \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Tangent Segment Property**
The tangent segment theorem states that if a line is tangent to a circle at a point, the segment of the tangent from the external point to the point of tangency is unique and does not directly relate to other tangents unless they share the same external point. Here, we are given the total length of the tangent segment \( WX \), which is split into two parts:
\[ WX = WY + XY \]

#### **Step 2: Express the Total Length of \( WX \)**
From the image, the total length of the tangent segment \( WX \) is the sum of \( WY \) and \( XY \):
\[ WX = WY + XY \]
Substitute the given expressions for \( WY \) and \( XY \):
\[ WX = (2x + 9) + (3x + 6) \]
Simplify:
\[ WX = 5x + 15 \]

#### **Step 3: Use the Tangent-Secant Theorem (Indirectly)**
Although the problem does not explicitly involve a secant, the key is to recognize that the tangent segment \( WX \) is split into two parts, and the total length must be consistent with the given expressions. Since \( WX \) is a single tangent segment, the expressions for \( WY \) and \( XY \) must satisfy the condition that their sum is a valid length.

#### **Step 4: Solve for \( x \)**
We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation derived from the total length of \( WX \). However, the problem does not provide an explicit total length for \( WX \). Instead, we use the fact that the expressions for \( WY \) and \( XY \) must be consistent with the properties of tangents. Since no additional constraints are given, we assume the expressions are directly solvable by equating the parts.

Given the problem's context and the answer choices, we test the values of \( x \) to ensure consistency.

#### **Step 5: Test the Answer Choices**
We test each value of \( x \) from the answer choices to see which one satisfies the given expressions.

- **Choice A: \( x = 2 \)**
  \[
  WY = 2(2) + 9 = 4 + 9 = 13
  \]
  \[
  XY = 3(2) + 6 = 6 + 6 = 12
  \]
  \[
  WX = WY + XY = 13 + 12 = 25
  \]
  This is a valid solution.

- **Choice B: \( x = 3 \)**
  \[
  WY = 2(3) + 9 = 6 + 9 = 15
  \]
  \[
  XY = 3(3) + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15
  \]
  \[
  WX = WY + XY = 15 + 15 = 30
  \]
  This is also a valid solution, but we need to check if it fits the context better.

- **Choice C: \( x = 6 \)**
  \[
  WY = 2(6) + 9 = 12 + 9 = 21
  \]
  \[
  XY = 3(6) + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24
  \]
  \[
  WX = WY + XY = 21 + 24 = 45
  \]
  This is a valid solution but larger than necessary.

- **Choice D: \( x = 9 \)**
  \[
  WY = 2(9) + 9 = 18 + 9 = 27
  \]
  \[
  XY = 3(9) + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33
  \]
  \[
  WX = WY + XY = 27 + 33 = 60
  \]
  This is a valid solution but much larger.

#### **Step 6: Select the Most Reasonable Answer**
Given the answer choices, the smallest and most reasonable value for \( x \) that fits the context of the problem is \( x = 3 \), as it provides a balanced and simple solution without overly large values.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
