### Problem Analysis:
We are given a quadrilateral \(WXYZ\) which is a rectangle. The problem asks us to find the measure of \(\angle 3\) given that \(m\angle 1 = 30^\circ\). Let's break down the problem step by step.

#### **Step 1: Understanding the Geometry**
- **Rectangle Properties**: 
  - All interior angles of a rectangle are right angles (\(90^\circ\)).
  - Opposite sides are equal and parallel.
  - Diagonals are equal in length and bisect each other.

- **Given Information**:
  - \(m\angle 1 = 30^\circ\).
  - \(\angle 1\) is part of the triangle formed by the diagonal \(WX\) and the sides of the rectangle.

- **Goal**: Find \(m\angle 3\).

#### **Step 2: Identifying Relationships**
- The diagonal \(WX\) divides the rectangle into two congruent right triangles: \(\triangle WXY\) and \(\triangle WXZ\).
- In \(\triangle WXY\), \(\angle WXY = 90^\circ\) (since \(WXYZ\) is a rectangle).
- The angle \(\angle 1\) is an acute angle in \(\triangle WXY\), and it is adjacent to \(\angle 9\) (which is part of the same triangle).

#### **Step 3: Using Triangle Properties**
- In \(\triangle WXY\):
  - The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is \(180^\circ\).
  - \(\angle WXY = 90^\circ\).
  - \(\angle 1 = 30^\circ\).
  - Let \(\angle 9\) be the third angle in \(\triangle WXY\). Then:
    \[
    \angle 9 = 180^\circ - \angle WXY - \angle 1 = 180^\circ - 90^\circ - 30^\circ = 60^\circ.
    \]

#### **Step 4: Relating \(\angle 9\) to \(\angle 3\)** 
- The diagonal \(XZ\) intersects the diagonal \(WX\) at point \(A\), forming another triangle \(\triangle XAZ\).
- \(\angle 9\) and \(\angle 3\) are vertically opposite angles because they are formed by the intersection of the diagonals \(WX\) and \(XZ\).
- Vertically opposite angles are always equal. Therefore:
  \[
  \angle 3 = \angle 9 = 60^\circ.
  \]

#### **Step 5: Verifying the Solution**
- We have used the property that vertically opposite angles are equal.
- Since \(\angle 9 = 60^\circ\) and \(\angle 3\) is vertically opposite to \(\angle 9\), it follows that:
  \[
  m\angle 3 = 60^\circ.
  \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
