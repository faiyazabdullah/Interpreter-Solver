### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a circle with several points labeled on its circumference: \( R, S, T, U \). Chords and segments are drawn within the circle, and specific lengths are provided:
- \( RV = 4 \)
- \( VT = 4 \)
- \( RU = 8 \)

Point \( X \) lies on the chord \( ST \), and we are tasked with finding the value of \( x \), which appears to represent the length of segment \( SX \).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### **1. Identify Key Geometric Relationships:**
The problem involves a circle and its chords. One important property to consider is the **Intersecting Chords Theorem**, which states:
\[ RV \cdot VU = SV \cdot VT \]

However, in this case, we do not have enough information about \( VU \) or \( SV \) directly. Instead, we need to focus on the symmetry and proportional relationships suggested by the diagram.

#### **2. Analyze the Given Lengths:**
- \( RV = 4 \)
- \( VT = 4 \)
- \( RU = 8 \)

The segment \( RU \) spans from \( R \) to \( U \) and is divided into two parts by point \( V \):
- \( RV = 4 \)
- \( VU = RU - RV = 8 - 4 = 4 \)

Thus, \( VU = 4 \).

#### **3. Examine the Symmetry and Proportions:**
The diagram suggests symmetry in the circle. The segment \( ST \) is divided into two parts by point \( X \):
- \( SX = x \)
- \( XT = 4 \) (since \( VT = 4 \) and \( V \) is the midpoint of \( ST \))

Given the symmetry and equal segment lengths (\( RV = VU = 4 \)), it is reasonable to assume that \( SX = XT \). Therefore:
\[ x = XT = 4 \]

#### **4. Verify the Solution:**
The symmetry and equal division of segments suggest that \( SX = XT = 4 \). This aligns with the consistent pattern observed in the given lengths.

### Final Answer:
Based on the symmetry and proportional relationships in the circle, the value of \( x \) is:
\[ x = 4 \]

Final Answer: **C**
