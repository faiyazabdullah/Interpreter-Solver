### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a circle with several tangent segments and points labeled. Here's the breakdown of the given information:
- **Tangent segments**: Segments \( XD \) and \( XE \) are tangent to the circle at points \( D \) and \( E \), respectively.
- **Lengths**: 
  - \( XD = 9 \)
  - \( XC = 6 \)
- The problem asks us to find the length of segment \( XA \).

### Key Geometric Property:
The key property we will use here is the **Tangent-Segment Theorem**, which states that if two tangent segments are drawn to a circle from the same external point, then those segments are congruent. Mathematically:
\[ XD = XE \]

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the Tangent Segments
From the image, we observe:
- \( XD \) and \( XE \) are tangent segments from the external point \( X \) to the circle.
- By the Tangent-Segment Theorem, \( XD = XE \). Given \( XD = 9 \), it follows that:
\[ XE = 9 \]

#### Step 2: Use the Tangent-Segment Theorem for \( XA \)
The segment \( XA \) can be broken down into two parts:
- \( XC \) (a tangent segment from \( X \) to the circle at point \( C \))
- \( CA \) (another tangent segment from \( X \) to the circle at point \( A \))

By the Tangent-Segment Theorem:
\[ XC = CE \]
Given \( XC = 6 \), it follows that:
\[ CE = 6 \]

#### Step 3: Calculate \( XA \)
Since \( XA \) is composed of \( XC \) and \( CA \), and \( CA = CE \):
\[ XA = XC + CA = XC + CE \]
Substitute the known values:
\[ XA = 6 + 6 = 12 \]

### Final Answer:
The length of \( XA \) is \( 12 \).

\[
\boxed{C}
\]
