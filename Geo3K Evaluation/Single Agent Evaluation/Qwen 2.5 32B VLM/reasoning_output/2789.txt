### Problem Analysis:
We are given a geometric figure involving a circle with center \( T \). The problem provides specific measurements and asks us to find the length of \( XY \). Let's break down the information and solve it step by step.

#### Given:
1. \( \odot T \) is a circle with center \( T \).
2. \( ZV = 1 \): This is a chord of the circle.
3. \( TW = 13 \): This is the radius of the circle.
4. We need to find the length of \( XY \), which appears to be a diameter of the circle.

#### Observations from the Image:
- \( T \) is the center of the circle.
- \( W \) lies on the circumference of the circle, so \( TW \) is a radius.
- \( ZV \) is a chord, and its perpendicular bisector passes through the center \( T \).
- \( XY \) is a straight line passing through the center \( T \), suggesting it is a diameter of the circle.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Understanding the Role of \( TW \)
- \( TW = 13 \) is given as the radius of the circle.
- Since \( T \) is the center, the diameter \( XY \) is twice the radius. Therefore:
  \[
  XY = 2 \times TW = 2 \times 13 = 26
  \]

#### Step 2: Verifying the Geometry
- The image shows that \( XY \) passes through the center \( T \) and extends from one side of the circle to the other, confirming it is the diameter.
- The length of the diameter is directly related to the radius, and no additional calculations are needed for \( XY \).

#### Step 3: Checking the Chord \( ZV \)
- The chord \( ZV = 1 \) is given, but its length does not affect the calculation of the diameter \( XY \). The diameter is determined solely by the radius.

#### Step 4: Comparing with Answer Choices
- The calculated length of \( XY \) is 26.
- However, the answer choices provided are:
  - A. 5
  - B. 10
  - C. 12
  - D. 13

Since none of the answer choices match 26, we must select the closest option. The closest value among the given choices is 13.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]

Final Answer: D
