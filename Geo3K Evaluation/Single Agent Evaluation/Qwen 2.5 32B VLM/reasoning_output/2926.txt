### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a trapezoid \(ABCD\) with the following dimensions:
- \(AD = 15 \, \text{cm}\) (one base of the trapezoid)
- \(BC = 14 \, \text{cm}\) (the other base of the trapezoid)
- \(AB = 10 \, \text{cm}\) (a side of the trapezoid)
- \(CD\) is the height of the trapezoid, which is perpendicular to both bases \(AD\) and \(BC\).

The goal is to find the area of the trapezoid. The formula for the area of a trapezoid is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{Base}_1 + \text{Base}_2) \times \text{Height}
\]
where:
- \(\text{Base}_1\) and \(\text{Base}_2\) are the lengths of the two parallel sides.
- \(\text{Height}\) is the perpendicular distance between the two bases.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Identify the bases and height:
- The two bases of the trapezoid are \(AD\) and \(BC\):
  \[
  \text{Base}_1 = AD = 15 \, \text{cm}, \quad \text{Base}_2 = BC = 14 \, \text{cm}
  \]
- The height of the trapezoid is the perpendicular distance between the bases \(AD\) and \(BC\). From the image, it is clear that \(CD\) is the height. Since \(AB\) is given as 10 cm and forms a right angle with the bases, \(CD = AB = 10 \, \text{cm}\).

#### 2. Apply the trapezoid area formula:
The formula for the area of a trapezoid is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{Base}_1 + \text{Base}_2) \times \text{Height}
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (15 + 14) \times 10
\]

#### 3. Perform the calculations:
First, calculate the sum of the bases:
\[
15 + 14 = 29
\]
Next, multiply by the height:
\[
29 \times 10 = 290
\]
Finally, divide by 2:
\[
\frac{290}{2} = 145
\]

#### 4. Compare with the answer choices:
The calculated area is \(145 \, \text{cm}^2\). However, this value does not match any of the provided answer choices (A. 45, B. 90, C. 180, D. 360). Upon re-examining the problem, it appears there might be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation. Let's revisit the image and the given dimensions to ensure accuracy.

Upon closer inspection, the height \(CD\) is indeed 10 cm, and the bases are correctly identified as 15 cm and 14 cm. The calculation is correct based on the given information. However, since the result does not match any of the provided choices, we must select the closest option.

### Final Answer:
The closest answer choice to \(145 \, \text{cm}^2\) is \(180 \, \text{cm}^2\).

\[
\boxed{C}
\]

Final Answer: C
