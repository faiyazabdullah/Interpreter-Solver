### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
- The figure shows a circle centered at \( O \) (denoted as \(\odot O\)).
- \( EC \) and \( AB \) are diameters of the circle. This means they pass through the center \( O \) and divide the circle into two equal halves.
- The angles \(\angle BOE\), \(\angle DOE\), \(\angle EOF\), and \(\angle FOA\) are congruent. This implies that each of these angles is equal in measure.
- We need to find the measure of the arc \( \widehat{AE} \).

#### Step 2: Understand the Geometry
- Since \( EC \) and \( AB \) are diameters, they divide the circle into four equal quadrants.
- The total measure of the circle is \( 360^\circ \).
- The circle is divided into four central angles: \(\angle BOE\), \(\angle DOE\), \(\angle EOF\), and \(\angle FOA\). Since these angles are congruent, each angle measures:
  \[
  \frac{360^\circ}{4} = 90^\circ
  \]

#### Step 3: Relate Angles to Arcs
- The measure of an arc is equal to the measure of the central angle that subtends it.
- The arc \( \widehat{AE} \) is subtended by the central angle \(\angle FOA\).
- From the analysis above, \(\angle FOA = 90^\circ\).

#### Step 4: Verify the Arc Measure
- Since \(\angle FOA = 90^\circ\), the arc \( \widehat{AE} \) also measures \( 90^\circ \).

#### Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices
- The measure of arc \( \widehat{AE} \) is \( 90^\circ \).
- The answer choices are:
  - A. 45
  - B. 90
  - C. 180
  - D. 360
- The correct choice is \( B \).

### Solution Section

Based on the analysis:

1. The circle is divided into four equal central angles, each measuring \( 90^\circ \).
2. The arc \( \widehat{AE} \) is subtended by the central angle \(\angle FOA\), which measures \( 90^\circ \).
3. Therefore, the measure of arc \( \widehat{AE} \) is \( 90^\circ \).

Final Answer: **B**
