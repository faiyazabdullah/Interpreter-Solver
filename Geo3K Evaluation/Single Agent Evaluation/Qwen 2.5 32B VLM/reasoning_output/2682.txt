### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the given information
- The figure is a parallelogram \(ABCD\).
- One side of the parallelogram, \(BC\), is given as \(12 \, \text{cm}\).
- The height of the parallelogram, which is the perpendicular distance from \(D\) to \(BC\), is labeled but not directly given.
- The angle between side \(AB\) (or \(DC\)) and base \(BC\) is given as \(60^\circ\).
- The length of side \(AB\) (or \(DC\)) is given as \(20 \, \text{cm}\).

#### Step 2: Identify what needs to be found
We need to find the area of the parallelogram. The formula for the area of a parallelogram is:
\[
\text{Area} = \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
Here, the base is \(BC = 12 \, \text{cm}\), and we need to determine the height.

#### Step 3: Determine the height
The height of the parallelogram can be found using the given angle \(60^\circ\) and the side length \(AB = 20 \, \text{cm}\). The height is the perpendicular distance from \(D\) to \(BC\), which forms a right triangle with side \(AB\) and the base \(BC\).

In the right triangle formed:
- The hypotenuse is \(AB = 20 \, \text{cm}\).
- The angle between \(AB\) and \(BC\) is \(60^\circ\).
- The height \(DE\) is the opposite side to the \(60^\circ\) angle in this right triangle.

Using trigonometry, specifically the sine function:
\[
\sin(60^\circ) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{DE}{AB}
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
\sin(60^\circ) = \frac{DE}{20}
\]
We know that \(\sin(60^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\):
\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{DE}{20}
\]
Solve for \(DE\):
\[
DE = 20 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 10\sqrt{3}
\]
Calculate the numerical value:
\[
10\sqrt{3} \approx 10 \times 1.732 = 17.32 \, \text{cm}
\]

#### Step 4: Calculate the area of the parallelogram
Now that we have the height \(DE = 17.32 \, \text{cm}\) and the base \(BC = 12 \, \text{cm}\), we can find the area:
\[
\text{Area} = \text{base} \times \text{height} = 12 \times 17.32 = 207.84 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### Step 5: Round to the nearest tenth
Rounding \(207.84\) to the nearest tenth gives:
\[
207.8
\]

#### Step 6: Compare with the answer choices
The calculated area is \(207.8 \, \text{cm}^2\). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 120
- B. 124.7
- C. 207.8
- D. 240

The closest match is \(207.8\).

The area of the parallelogram is:
\[
\boxed{207.8}
\]
