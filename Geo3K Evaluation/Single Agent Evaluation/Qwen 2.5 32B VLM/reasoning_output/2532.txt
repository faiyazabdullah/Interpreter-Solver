### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Analyze the given information
- The image shows a circle with several labeled points (A, B, C, D, E).
- There are two central angles:
  - Angle subtended by arc \( \overarc{AB} \): \( 150^\circ \)
  - Angle subtended by arc \( \overarc{AD} \): \( 85^\circ \)
- Point A is connected to points B, C, and D, forming angles at A.
- The goal is to find the value of \( x \), which represents the measure of angle \( \angle CAD \).

#### Step 2: Identify relevant geometric properties
- **Central Angles and Arcs**: The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of the arc it subtends.
- **Inscribed Angles**: An inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts.
- **Sum of Angles in a Triangle**: The sum of the interior angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \).

#### Step 3: Break down the problem
- The angle \( \angle CAD \) is part of the larger triangle \( \triangle ACD \).
- To find \( x \), we need to determine the measures of the other angles in \( \triangle ACD \).

#### Step 4: Calculate the measure of arc \( \overarc{CD} \)
- The total measure of the circle is \( 360^\circ \).
- The measure of arc \( \overarc{AB} \) is \( 150^\circ \).
- The measure of arc \( \overarc{AD} \) is \( 85^\circ \).
- The remaining arc \( \overarc{BC} \) can be calculated as:
  \[
  \overarc{BC} = 360^\circ - (\overarc{AB} + \overarc{AD}) = 360^\circ - (150^\circ + 85^\circ) = 125^\circ
  \]

#### Step 5: Determine the measure of \( \angle CAD \)
- The angle \( \angle CAD \) is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc \( \overarc{CD} \).
- The measure of arc \( \overarc{CD} \) is the remaining part of the circle after subtracting the arcs \( \overarc{AB} \) and \( \overarc{AD} \):
  \[
  \overarc{CD} = 360^\circ - (\overarc{AB} + \overarc{AD} + \overarc{BC}) = 360^\circ - (150^\circ + 85^\circ + 125^\circ) = 0^\circ
  \]
  However, this calculation seems incorrect because we need to re-evaluate the relationship between the arcs and the angles.

#### Step 6: Re-evaluate the problem
- The angle \( \angle CAD \) is part of the triangle \( \triangle ACD \).
- The angle \( \angle CAD \) is formed by the intersection of the radii at point A.
- The measure of \( \angle CAD \) can be found using the difference between the central angles:
  \[
  \angle CAD = \frac{1}{2} (\text{Difference of central angles})
  \]
  Here, the central angles are \( 150^\circ \) and \( 85^\circ \):
  \[
  \angle CAD = \frac{1}{2} (150^\circ - 85^\circ) = \frac{1}{2} (65^\circ) = 32.5^\circ
  \]

#### Step 7: Compare with the answer choices
- The calculated value of \( x \) is \( 32.5^\circ \).
- The closest answer choice to \( 32.5^\circ \) is \( 35^\circ \).

### Solution Section:

Based on the detailed analysis and calculations, the value of \( x \) is closest to \( 35^\circ \).
