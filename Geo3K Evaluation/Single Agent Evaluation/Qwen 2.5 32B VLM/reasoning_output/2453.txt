### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a rhombus $ FGHJ $ with diagonals intersecting at point $ K $. The key properties of a rhombus that are relevant here are:
1. All sides of a rhombus are equal.
2. The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.

From the problem statement:
- $ GH = x + 9 $
- $ JH = 5x - 2 $

Since $ FGHJ $ is a rhombus, all its sides are equal. Therefore:
$$
GH = JH
$$

This gives us the equation:
$$
x + 9 = 5x - 2
$$

We need to solve this equation for $ x $.

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Understanding the Rhombus Properties
- A rhombus has four equal sides. Therefore, $ GH = JH $.
- The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, but this property is not directly needed to solve for $ x $ in this problem.

#### Step 2: Setting Up the Equation
Given:
$$
GH = x + 9
$$
$$
JH = 5x - 2
$$
Since $ GH = JH $ in a rhombus:
$$
x + 9 = 5x - 2
$$

#### Step 3: Solving the Equation
Rearrange the equation to isolate $ x $:
1. Subtract $ x $ from both sides:
   $$
   9 = 4x - 2
   $$
2. Add 2 to both sides:
   $$
   11 = 4x
   $$
3. Divide both sides by 4:
   $$
   x = \frac{11}{4} = 2.75
   $$

#### Step 4: Verifying the Solution
Substitute $ x = 2.75 $ back into the expressions for $ GH $ and $ JH $:
- $ GH = x + 9 = 2.75 + 9 = 11.75 $
- $ JH = 5x - 2 = 5(2.75) - 2 = 13.75 - 2 = 11.75 $

Since $ GH = JH = 11.75 $, the solution satisfies the condition that all sides of the rhombus are equal.

#### Step 5: Comparing with Answer Choices
The calculated value of $ x $ is $ 2.75 $. Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 2.75
- B. 3
- C. 5.5
- D. 9

The closest and exact match is $ 2.75 $.

### Solution Section:

The value of $ x $ is:
$$
x = 2.75
$$

Final Answer: $\boxed{A}$
