### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
The problem involves a parallelogram \( JKLM \). Here's what we know from the image:
- \( JKLM \) is a parallelogram.
- \( \angle MLK = 70^\circ \).
- \( \angle MKL = 30^\circ \).
- The sides are labeled with expressions involving variables \( a \) and \( b \), but these are not directly relevant to finding the angle \( \angle JKL \).

#### Step 2: Identify Key Properties of a Parallelogram
Parallelograms have several key properties:
1. Opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.
2. Opposite angles are equal.
3. Consecutive angles are supplementary (sum to \( 180^\circ \)).

#### Step 3: Determine the Angle Relationships
In parallelogram \( JKLM \):
- \( \angle MLK \) and \( \angle MKL \) are given as \( 70^\circ \) and \( 30^\circ \), respectively.
- Since \( \angle MLK \) and \( \angle MKL \) are adjacent angles at vertex \( L \), we can find \( \angle KLM \) using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \):
  \[
  \angle KLM = 180^\circ - \angle MLK - \angle MKL = 180^\circ - 70^\circ - 30^\circ = 80^\circ.
  \]

#### Step 4: Use the Property of Opposite Angles in a Parallelogram
In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. Therefore:
- \( \angle JKL = \angle KLM \).

Since we have already determined that \( \angle KLM = 80^\circ \), it follows that:
\[
\angle JKL = 80^\circ.
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the Solution
- The angle \( \angle JKL \) is indeed the opposite angle to \( \angle KLM \) in the parallelogram.
- The calculation of \( \angle KLM \) is consistent with the given angles at vertex \( L \).

### Solution Section

Based on the properties of a parallelogram and the calculations:
\[
\angle JKL = 80^\circ.
\]

Final Answer: \boxed{C}
