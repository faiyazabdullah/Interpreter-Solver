### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a geometric figure involving similar triangles. The key elements are:
- Triangle \( \triangle ABQ \) and its scaled version \( \triangle AB'B' \).
- The line segment \( BQ = 8 \) and the line segment \( QB' = 6 \).
- We need to find the scale factor from \( B \) to \( B' \).

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify Similar Triangles:**
   - The triangles \( \triangle ABQ \) and \( \triangle AB'B' \) appear to be similar because they share the same orientation and angles (as indicated by the parallel lines and the proportional scaling).
   - When two triangles are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional.

2. **Determine the Scale Factor:**
   - The scale factor between two similar figures is the ratio of the lengths of corresponding sides.
   - Here, the side \( BQ \) in \( \triangle ABQ \) corresponds to the side \( BB' \) in \( \triangle AB'B' \).

3. **Calculate the Length \( BB' \):**
   - From the image, \( BQ = 8 \) and \( QB' = 6 \).
   - The total length \( BB' \) is the sum of \( BQ \) and \( QB' \):
     \[
     BB' = BQ + QB' = 8 + 6 = 14
     \]

4. **Find the Scale Factor:**
   - The scale factor from \( B \) to \( B' \) is the ratio of the length \( BB' \) to the original length \( BQ \):
     \[
     \text{Scale Factor} = \frac{BB'}{BQ} = \frac{14}{8} = \frac{7}{4}
     \]

5. **Reassess the Problem:**
   - Upon re-examining the problem, it appears there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the scale factor. The question asks for the scale factor from \( B \) to \( B' \), which should be the ratio of the distance \( QB' \) to \( BQ \) since \( B' \) is the scaled point.
   - Therefore, the correct scale factor should be:
     \[
     \text{Scale Factor} = \frac{QB'}{BQ} = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4}
     \]

### Final Answer:
The correct scale factor from \( B \) to \( B' \) is \( \frac{3}{4} \).

\[
\boxed{A}
\]
