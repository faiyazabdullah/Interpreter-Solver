### Thought Section

1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - The figure is a parallelogram labeled \(ABCD\).
   - The side lengths provided are:
     - \(AD = 23\) ft (one side of the parallelogram).
     - \(AB = 16\) ft (the adjacent side of the parallelogram).
   - There is a right triangle formed by dropping a perpendicular from \(B\) to \(AD\), meeting \(AD\) at point \(E\). This creates \(\triangle BEC\).
   - The angle \(\angle ADE = 60^\circ\).

2. **Understand the Relationships:**
   - In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. Therefore:
     - \(AB = CD = 16\) ft.
     - \(AD = BC = 23\) ft.
   - The goal is to find the perimeter of the parallelogram, which is the sum of all its sides.

3. **Calculate the Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter \(P\) of a parallelogram is given by:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - Here, the "length" is \(AD = 23\) ft and the "width" is \(AB = 16\) ft.
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (23 + 16) = 2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ ft}
     \]

4. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - The perimeter is simply the sum of all four sides of the parallelogram. Since opposite sides are equal, the calculation is straightforward.
   - No additional geometric properties or relationships are needed beyond the basic definition of a parallelogram.

5. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated perimeter is \(78\) ft.
   - The answer choices are:
     - A. 32
     - B. 39
     - C. 46
     - D. 78
   - The closest match is \(78\).

### Solution Section

The perimeter of the parallelogram is calculated as follows:
\[
P = 2 \times (23 + 16) = 2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ ft}
\]

Final Answer: **D**
