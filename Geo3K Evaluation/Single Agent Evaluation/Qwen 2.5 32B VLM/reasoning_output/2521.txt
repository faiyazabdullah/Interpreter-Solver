### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the value of \( x \) for an **equilateral triangle** \( RST \). The key properties of an equilateral triangle are:
1. All three sides are equal in length.
2. All interior angles are \( 60^\circ \).

From the problem, the side lengths are given as:
- \( RS = x + 9 \)
- \( ST = 2x \)
- \( RT = 3x - 9 \)

Since \( RST \) is an equilateral triangle, we have:
\[ RS = ST = RT \]

This gives us the following equations:
1. \( x + 9 = 2x \)
2. \( x + 9 = 3x - 9 \)
3. \( 2x = 3x - 9 \)

We will solve these equations step by step to find the value of \( x \).

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Solve \( x + 9 = 2x \)
Rearrange the equation to isolate \( x \):
\[
x + 9 = 2x \\
9 = 2x - x \\
9 = x
\]
So, \( x = 9 \).

#### Step 2: Verify \( x + 9 = 3x - 9 \)
Substitute \( x = 9 \) into the equation:
\[
x + 9 = 3x - 9 \\
9 + 9 = 3(9) - 9 \\
18 = 27 - 9 \\
18 = 18
\]
The equation holds true for \( x = 9 \).

#### Step 3: Verify \( 2x = 3x - 9 \)
Substitute \( x = 9 \) into the equation:
\[
2x = 3x - 9 \\
2(9) = 3(9) - 9 \\
18 = 27 - 9 \\
18 = 18
\]
The equation also holds true for \( x = 9 \).

#### Step 4: Check consistency
All three conditions \( RS = ST = RT \) are satisfied when \( x = 9 \). Therefore, \( x = 9 \) is the correct solution.

---

### Solution Section:

The value of \( x \) that satisfies the conditions of the equilateral triangle is \( x = 9 \).

Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 3
- B. 6
- C. 9
- D. 12

The correct answer is \( C. 9 \).

Final Answer: **C**
