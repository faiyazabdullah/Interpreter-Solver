### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves finding the measure of angle \( \angle 2 \) in a circle given the measures of arcs \( \widehat{BC} \) and \( \widehat{AD} \). The image shows a circle with points \( A, B, C, D, E \), and several angles labeled. Here's the breakdown of the given information:

- \( m\widehat{BC} = 30^\circ \)
- \( m\widehat{AD} = 20^\circ \)
- \( \angle 2 \) is an inscribed angle subtended by arc \( \widehat{BD} \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understanding Inscribed Angles**
An inscribed angle in a circle is half the measure of the arc it subtends. Mathematically, if an inscribed angle \( \theta \) subtends an arc \( \widehat{XY} \), then:
\[
\theta = \frac{1}{2} \cdot m\widehat{XY}
\]

#### **Step 2: Identifying Arc \( \widehat{BD} \)**
To find \( \angle 2 \), we need the measure of arc \( \widehat{BD} \). The arc \( \widehat{BD} \) is composed of two parts: \( \widehat{BC} \) and \( \widehat{CD} \). However, since \( \widehat{CD} \) is not directly given, we need to use the total circumference of the circle and the given arcs.

The total circumference of the circle is \( 360^\circ \). The arc \( \widehat{BD} \) can be found by subtracting the arcs \( \widehat{AD} \) and \( \widehat{BC} \) from the remaining parts of the circle.

#### **Step 3: Calculating Arc \( \widehat{BD} \)**
The arc \( \widehat{BD} \) is the sum of \( \widehat{BC} \) and \( \widehat{CD} \). Since \( \widehat{CD} \) is not explicitly given, we need to use the fact that the total circle is \( 360^\circ \). However, the key is to recognize that \( \angle 2 \) is directly related to the arc \( \widehat{BD} \), which is the sum of \( \widehat{BC} \) and \( \widehat{CD} \).

Given:
- \( m\widehat{BC} = 30^\circ \)
- \( m\widehat{AD} = 20^\circ \)

Since \( \angle 2 \) is an inscribed angle subtending \( \widehat{BD} \), we need to find the measure of \( \widehat{BD} \). However, the problem simplifies because \( \angle 2 \) is directly related to the given arcs.

#### **Step 4: Applying the Inscribed Angle Theorem**
The measure of \( \angle 2 \) is half the measure of the arc \( \widehat{BD} \). Since \( \angle 2 \) is subtended by \( \widehat{BD} \), and \( \widehat{BD} \) is the sum of \( \widehat{BC} \) and \( \widehat{CD} \), we can use the given information directly.

The measure of \( \angle 2 \) is:
\[
m\angle 2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (m\widehat{BC} + m\widehat{CD})
\]

However, since \( \widehat{CD} \) is not directly given, we can infer that the problem is simplified by the given arcs. The measure of \( \angle 2 \) is directly related to the arc \( \widehat{BD} \), which is the sum of the given arcs.

#### **Step 5: Final Calculation**
Given the problem's setup and the inscribed angle theorem, the measure of \( \angle 2 \) is:
\[
m\angle 2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (m\widehat{BC} + m\widehat{AD}) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (30^\circ + 20^\circ) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 50^\circ = 25^\circ
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
