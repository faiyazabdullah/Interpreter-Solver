### Problem Analysis:
The given image depicts a geometric figure with several right triangles and labeled segments. Here's a summary of the information:

1. **Triangle \( YXA \)**:
   - \( YA = 5 \)
   - \( XA \) is part of the triangle and perpendicular to \( AB \).

2. **Triangle \( XZB \)**:
   - \( XB = 14 \)
   - \( ZB \) is perpendicular to \( AB \).
   - \( ZB = z \) (the value we need to find).

3. **Key Observations**:
   - Both \( XA \) and \( ZB \) are perpendicular to \( AB \), meaning they form right triangles with \( AB \).
   - \( X \) is the point where the two triangles meet, and it divides \( AB \) into two segments: \( AX \) and \( XB \).

The goal is to determine the length of \( ZB = z \).

---

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to find the length \( z \) of segment \( ZB \). Since both triangles involve right angles, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the sides.

#### Step 2: Analyze Triangle \( YXA \)
- \( YA = 5 \) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle \( YXA \).
- Let \( XA = h_1 \) (height from \( X \) to \( A \)).
- Since \( XA \) is perpendicular to \( AB \), we can write:
  \[
  YA^2 = YX^2 + XA^2
  \]
  However, we do not have \( YX \) explicitly, so we will focus on the next triangle.

#### Step 3: Analyze Triangle \( XZB \)
- \( XB = 14 \) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle \( XZB \).
- Let \( ZB = z \) (height from \( Z \) to \( B \)).
- Using the Pythagorean theorem for triangle \( XZB \):
  \[
  XB^2 = XZ^2 + ZB^2
  \]
  Here, \( XB = 14 \) and \( ZB = z \). We need to find \( XZ \).

#### Step 4: Relate the Two Triangles
- Notice that \( X \) is a common point between the two triangles.
- Since \( XA \) and \( ZB \) are both perpendicular to \( AB \), the horizontal distance \( AX + XB \) is the total base of the larger triangle formed by combining the two right triangles.

However, we do not have enough information about \( XZ \) directly. Instead, we can use the fact that the vertical distances (heights) in the problem are related through the Pythagorean theorem.

#### Step 5: Solve for \( z \)
From the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \( XZB \):
\[
XB^2 = XZ^2 + ZB^2
\]
Substitute \( XB = 14 \) and \( ZB = z \):
\[
14^2 = XZ^2 + z^2
\]
\[
196 = XZ^2 + z^2
\]

To find \( XZ \), we need additional information. However, since the problem does not provide \( XZ \) explicitly, we assume \( XZ \) is part of the configuration that allows us to solve for \( z \) directly.

Given the problem's structure and the answer choices, we test the possible values of \( z \) to see which fits the equation.

#### Step 6: Test the Answer Choices
- **Choice A**: \( z = \sqrt{19} \)
  \[
  196 = XZ^2 + (\sqrt{19})^2
  \]
  \[
  196 = XZ^2 + 19
  \]
  \[
  XZ^2 = 177 \quad \text{(not matching any simple form)}
  \]

- **Choice B**: \( z = 5 \)
  \[
  196 = XZ^2 + 5^2
  \]
  \[
  196 = XZ^2 + 25
  \]
  \[
  XZ^2 = 171 \quad \text{(not matching any simple form)}
  \]

- **Choice C**: \( z = 3\sqrt{19} \)
  \[
  196 = XZ^2 + (3\sqrt{19})^2
  \]
  \[
  196 = XZ^2 + 9 \cdot 19
  \]
  \[
  196 = XZ^2 + 171
  \]
  \[
  XZ^2 = 25 \quad \text{(valid, since } XZ = 5\text{)}
  \]

- **Choice D**: \( z = 14 \)
  \[
  196 = XZ^2 + 14^2
  \]
  \[
  196 = XZ^2 + 196
  \]
  \[
  XZ^2 = 0 \quad \text{(invalid, as } XZ \neq 0\text{)}
  \]

#### Step 7: Verify the Correct Choice
The only valid choice that satisfies the Pythagorean theorem is \( z = 3\sqrt{19} \).

---

### Solution Section:

After testing the answer choices, the correct value for \( z \) is:
\[
z = 3\sqrt{19}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]

Final Answer: C
