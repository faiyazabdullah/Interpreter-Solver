### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a triangle \( \triangle JKL \) with the following details:
- Side \( JK = 7x \)
- Side \( KL = 11x - 8 \)
- Side \( JL = x + 12 \)

The markings indicate that \( JK \) and \( KL \) are congruent sides, meaning \( JK = KL \). This makes \( \triangle JKL \) an isosceles triangle with \( JK = KL \).

The task is to find the length of \( JL \), denoted as \( x + 12 \).

### Thought Section:
1. **Identify Congruent Sides:**
   - The markings on \( JK \) and \( KL \) indicate that these sides are congruent. Therefore, we have:
     \[
     JK = KL
     \]
   - Substituting the given expressions for \( JK \) and \( KL \):
     \[
     7x = 11x - 8
     \]

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Rearrange the equation to isolate \( x \):
     \[
     7x = 11x - 8
     \]
     \[
     7x - 11x = -8
     \]
     \[
     -4x = -8
     \]
     \[
     x = 2
     \]

3. **Calculate the Length of \( JL \):**
   - The length of \( JL \) is given by \( x + 12 \). Substitute \( x = 2 \) into this expression:
     \[
     JL = x + 12 = 2 + 12 = 14
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the lengths of the sides:
     - \( JK = 7x = 7(2) = 14 \)
     - \( KL = 11x - 8 = 11(2) - 8 = 22 - 8 = 14 \)
     - \( JL = x + 12 = 2 + 12 = 14 \)
   - The calculations confirm that \( JK = KL = 14 \), and \( JL = 14 \), which is consistent with the problem's constraints.

5. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated length of \( JL \) is 14. Comparing this with the given answer choices:
     - A. 7
     - B. 11
     - C. 12
     - D. 14

### Solution Section:
The length of \( JL \) is \( 14 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{D}
\]
