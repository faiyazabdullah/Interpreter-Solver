### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves finding the measure of angle \( \angle 14 \) given that \( m\angle 1 = 123^\circ \). We need to analyze the geometric relationships in the figure, particularly focusing on how angles are related through parallel lines, transversals, and other geometric properties.

#### Step 1: Identify Given Information
- \( m\angle 1 = 123^\circ \)
- The figure contains multiple lines and angles labeled with numbers (e.g., \( \angle 1, \angle 2, \ldots, \angle 14 \)).

#### Step 2: Understand the Relationships
The figure appears to involve:
- Parallel lines (indicated by the consistent spacing and markings).
- Transversals intersecting these parallel lines.
- Angles formed by these intersections, which can be analyzed using properties such as corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and supplementary angles.

#### Step 3: Locate Relevant Angles
From the figure:
- \( \angle 1 \) is located at the intersection of two lines.
- \( \angle 14 \) is located at a different intersection but may be related to \( \angle 1 \) through parallel lines and transversals.

#### Step 4: Apply Geometric Properties
1. **Identify Parallel Lines and Transversals:**
   - The lines \( \overline{GH} \parallel \overline{IJ} \parallel \overline{KL} \parallel \overline{MN} \).
   - The lines \( \overline{CD} \), \( \overline{EF} \), \( \overline{PQ} \), etc., act as transversals.

2. **Use Corresponding Angles:**
   - When a transversal intersects parallel lines, corresponding angles are equal.
   - For example, if \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 14 \) are corresponding angles, then \( m\angle 14 = m\angle 1 \).

3. **Use Supplementary Angles:**
   - If \( \angle 1 \) and another angle form a linear pair (i.e., they are adjacent and add up to \( 180^\circ \)), then the other angle is \( 180^\circ - m\angle 1 \).

#### Step 5: Analyze the Position of \( \angle 14 \)
From the figure:
- \( \angle 14 \) is located in the same relative position as \( \angle 1 \) when considering the parallel lines and transversals.
- This suggests that \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 14 \) are corresponding angles.

#### Step 6: Calculate \( m\angle 14 \)
Since \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 14 \) are corresponding angles:
\[ m\angle 14 = m\angle 1 = 123^\circ \]

### Solution
Based on the analysis, the measure of \( \angle 14 \) is \( 123^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
