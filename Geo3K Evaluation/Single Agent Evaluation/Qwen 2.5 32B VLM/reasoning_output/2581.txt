### Problem Analysis:
The given image depicts a quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with labeled sides and expressions involving variables \(x\) and \(y\). For the quadrilateral to be a parallelogram, opposite sides must be equal in length. Therefore, we need to use this property to find the value of \(x\).

#### Given Information:
- Side \(AB = y + 11\)
- Side \(BC = x + 7\)
- Side \(CD = 3y - 5\)
- Side \(DA = 2x + 3\)

#### Goal:
Find the value of \(x\) such that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.

---

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Understand the Properties of a Parallelogram
For \(ABCD\) to be a parallelogram:
1. Opposite sides must be equal in length:
   - \(AB = CD\)
   - \(BC = DA\)

#### Step 2: Set Up Equations Based on Opposite Sides
Using the property \(AB = CD\):
\[
AB = y + 11 \quad \text{and} \quad CD = 3y - 5
\]
\[
y + 11 = 3y - 5
\]

Using the property \(BC = DA\):
\[
BC = x + 7 \quad \text{and} \quad DA = 2x + 3
\]
\[
x + 7 = 2x + 3
\]

#### Step 3: Solve for \(y\) Using \(AB = CD\)
\[
y + 11 = 3y - 5
\]
Subtract \(y\) from both sides:
\[
11 = 2y - 5
\]
Add 5 to both sides:
\[
16 = 2y
\]
Divide by 2:
\[
y = 8
\]

#### Step 4: Solve for \(x\) Using \(BC = DA\)
\[
x + 7 = 2x + 3
\]
Subtract \(x\) from both sides:
\[
7 = x + 3
\]
Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[
x = 4
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the Solution
- Substitute \(y = 8\) into \(AB\) and \(CD\):
  \[
  AB = y + 11 = 8 + 11 = 19
  \]
  \[
  CD = 3y - 5 = 3(8) - 5 = 24 - 5 = 19
  \]
  Since \(AB = CD\), the condition is satisfied.

- Substitute \(x = 4\) into \(BC\) and \(DA\):
  \[
  BC = x + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11
  \]
  \[
  DA = 2x + 3 = 2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
  Since \(BC = DA\), the condition is satisfied.

#### Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices
The value of \(x\) we found is \(4\), which matches one of the given answer choices.

### Solution Section:

After solving the equations and verifying the conditions for a parallelogram, we find:
\[
x = 4
\]

Final Answer: \(\boxed{A}\)
