### Problem Analysis:
We are given a circle \(\odot X\) with several points and line segments. The problem provides the following information:
1. \(AB = 30\)
2. \(CD = 30\)
3. \(m\widehat{CZ} = 40^\circ\)

We need to find \(m\widehat{CD}\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understanding the Given Information**
- \(AB = 30\) and \(CD = 30\) indicate that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) are equal in length.
- \(m\widehat{CZ} = 40^\circ\) is the measure of the arc \(\widehat{CZ}\).
- We need to find \(m\widehat{CD}\), the measure of the arc \(\widehat{CD}\).

#### **Step 2: Geometric Properties Relevant to the Problem**
1. **Equal Chords and Arcs**: In a circle, if two chords are equal in length, then the arcs subtended by these chords are also equal. This means:
   \[
   AB = CD \implies m\widehat{AB} = m\widehat{CD}
   \]

2. **Arc Addition**: The measure of an arc can be broken down into smaller arcs. For example, if \(\widehat{CD}\) is composed of \(\widehat{CZ}\) and \(\widehat{ZD}\), then:
   \[
   m\widehat{CD} = m\widehat{CZ} + m\widehat{ZD}
   \]

#### **Step 3: Analyzing the Image**
- The image shows that \(CZ\) is a part of the arc \(\widehat{CD}\). Since \(m\widehat{CZ} = 40^\circ\), we need to determine the remaining part of \(\widehat{CD}\), which is \(\widehat{ZD}\).

#### **Step 4: Using the Equal Chords Property**
Since \(AB = CD\), the arcs \(\widehat{AB}\) and \(\widehat{CD}\) are equal in measure. However, we do not have direct information about \(m\widehat{AB}\). Instead, we focus on the arc \(\widehat{CD}\) and its components.

#### **Step 5: Determining \(m\widehat{CD}\)**
- From the image, it appears that \(\widehat{CD}\) is composed of \(\widehat{CZ}\) and \(\widehat{ZD}\). Since \(m\widehat{CZ} = 40^\circ\), and there is no indication that \(\widehat{ZD}\) has a different measure, we assume symmetry or equal division unless stated otherwise.
- Given the symmetry and equal chord lengths, it is reasonable to infer that \(\widehat{CD}\) is twice the measure of \(\widehat{CZ}\) because \(CZ\) is half of \(CD\).

Thus:
\[
m\widehat{CD} = 2 \times m\widehat{CZ} = 2 \times 40^\circ = 80^\circ
\]

#### **Step 6: Verifying the Answer**
- The calculation is consistent with the property that equal chords subtend equal arcs. Since \(AB = CD\), the arc \(\widehat{CD}\) must be symmetric and equal in measure to the arc subtended by \(AB\).
- The measure of \(\widehat{CD}\) is indeed \(80^\circ\), as it is twice the measure of \(\widehat{CZ}\).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
