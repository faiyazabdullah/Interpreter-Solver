### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
The image shows two triangles:
1. **Triangle \( \triangle ABC \)**:
   - It is an isosceles triangle with \( AB = AC \).
   - The base \( BC \) is given as 5 units.
   - The side \( AB \) is labeled as \( x \).

2. **Triangle \( \triangle DEF \)**:
   - It is also an isosceles triangle with \( DE = DF \).
   - The base \( EF \) is given as 3 units.
   - The side \( DE \) is labeled as \( x - 4 \).

#### Step 2: Understand the Problem
We need to find the length of \( AB \), which is denoted as \( x \). Since both triangles are isosceles, we can use the property that the sides opposite equal angles are equal.

#### Step 3: Relate the Triangles
Both triangles are isosceles, and the problem suggests a relationship between them. Specifically, the side lengths of the triangles are related by the variables \( x \) and \( x - 4 \).

#### Step 4: Set Up the Equations
From the image, we observe that the triangles are similar in structure but scaled differently. However, the key relationship comes from the fact that the side lengths are directly given in terms of \( x \):
- In \( \triangle ABC \), \( AB = AC = x \).
- In \( \triangle DEF \), \( DE = DF = x - 4 \).

Since the triangles are isosceles and share a similar structure, we can use the given side lengths to set up an equation. The problem does not explicitly state similarity, but the consistent use of \( x \) suggests a direct relationship.

#### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)
The problem does not provide additional constraints like angles or specific similarity ratios, so we focus on the given side lengths:
- For \( \triangle ABC \), \( AB = x \).
- For \( \triangle DEF \), \( DE = x - 4 \).

Since the problem asks for \( AB \) and provides a direct relationship through \( x \), we need to ensure consistency with the given answer choices. Let's assume the problem intends for us to solve for \( x \) directly based on the structure of the triangles.

#### Step 6: Verify Consistency
The problem does not provide additional geometric constraints (like angle measures or specific similarity ratios), so we rely on the direct relationship \( AB = x \). The value of \( x \) must be consistent with the given answer choices.

#### Step 7: Test the Answer Choices
We need to test the answer choices to see which one fits the given conditions:
- **Choice A: \( x = 5.5 \)**
  - If \( x = 5.5 \), then \( DE = x - 4 = 5.5 - 4 = 1.5 \). This does not match the given base \( EF = 3 \).
- **Choice B: \( x = 7 \)**
  - If \( x = 7 \), then \( DE = x - 4 = 7 - 4 = 3 \). This matches the given base \( EF = 3 \).
- **Choice C: \( x = 8 \)**
  - If \( x = 8 \), then \( DE = x - 4 = 8 - 4 = 4 \). This does not match the given base \( EF = 3 \).
- **Choice D: \( x = 10 \)**
  - If \( x = 10 \), then \( DE = x - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6 \). This does not match the given base \( EF = 3 \).

#### Step 8: Select the Correct Answer
The only choice that satisfies the condition \( DE = x - 4 = 3 \) is \( x = 7 \).

### Solution Section

Based on the analysis and verification, the correct value of \( AB \) is \( x = 7 \).

Final Answer: **B**
