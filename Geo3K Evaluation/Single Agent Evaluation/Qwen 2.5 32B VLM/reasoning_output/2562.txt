### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a circle with a radius labeled as 3 inches. The points \( A \) and \( B \) are on the circumference of the circle, and the line segment \( AB \) is a chord of the circle. However, since no additional details about the chord (such as its length or position) are provided, we can infer that the question is asking for the area of the entire circle.

### Thought Section:
1. **Identify the Given Information:**
   - The radius of the circle is explicitly given as 3 inches.
   - The image does not provide any additional information about the chord \( AB \), so it is irrelevant to the calculation of the area of the circle.

2. **Understand What Needs to Be Found:**
   - The question asks for the area of the figure. Since the figure is a circle, we need to calculate the area of the circle using the formula for the area of a circle: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \pi r^2
     \]
   - Here, \( r = 3 \) inches.

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Formulas:**
   - The formula for the area of a circle is:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \pi r^2
     \]
   - Substituting \( r = 3 \):
     \[
     \text{Area} = \pi (3)^2 = 9\pi
     \]

4. **Calculate the Area:**
   - Using the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
     \[
     \text{Area} = 9 \times 3.14159 = 28.27431
     \]
   - Rounding to the nearest tenth:
     \[
     \text{Area} \approx 28.3
     \]

5. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated area is 28.3, which matches option C.

6. **Reassess and Reflect:**
   - The problem does not involve any additional complexities such as segments or sectors of the circle. The entire circle's area is being asked for, and the given radius is sufficient to compute it.
   - The calculation is straightforward and aligns with the provided answer choices.

### Solution Section:
The area of the circle is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Area} = \pi r^2 = \pi (3)^2 = 9\pi
\]
Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
\[
\text{Area} \approx 9 \times 3.14159 = 28.27431
\]
Rounding to the nearest tenth:
\[
\text{Area} \approx 28.3
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
