### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a square circumscribed around a circle. This means the circle is inscribed within the square, touching the square at the midpoints of its sides. The side length of the square is given as 14 yards. We need to find the circumference of the circle.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Square and Circle Relationship**: The diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square because the circle is inscribed in the square.
2. **Given Information**: The side length of the square is 14 yards.
3. **Required Calculation**: The circumference of the circle, which can be calculated using the formula \( C = \pi d \), where \( d \) is the diameter of the circle.

---

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the Diameter of the Circle
Since the circle is inscribed in the square, the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square. Therefore:
\[
d = 14 \text{ yards}
\]

#### Step 2: Use the Circumference Formula
The formula for the circumference of a circle is:
\[
C = \pi d
\]
Substituting the value of the diameter:
\[
C = \pi \times 14
\]

#### Step 3: Simplify the Expression
\[
C = 14\pi
\]

#### Step 4: Match the Result with the Answer Choices
The calculated circumference is \( 14\pi \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. \( 7\pi \)
- B. \( 14\pi \)
- C. \( 21\pi \)
- D. \( 28\pi \)

The correct answer is \( 14\pi \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
