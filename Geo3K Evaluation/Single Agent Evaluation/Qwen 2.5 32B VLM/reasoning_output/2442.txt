### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a geometric figure with several lines and angles. Here's what we can observe:
1. There is a vertical line intersecting a horizontal line at point \( F \), creating four right angles at the intersection.
2. Four angles are labeled as \( x^\circ \) around point \( F \).
3. These angles appear to be formed by lines extending from point \( F \) in different directions.

The goal is to determine the value of \( x \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**
- The vertical and horizontal lines form a cross at point \( F \), creating four right angles (each measuring \( 90^\circ \)).
- The four angles labeled \( x^\circ \) are formed by the intersections of additional lines with the vertical and horizontal lines.

#### **Step 2: Analyze the Angles**
- Since the vertical and horizontal lines are perpendicular, they divide the plane into four quadrants.
- The angles labeled \( x^\circ \) are likely the angles formed between these lines and the extensions from \( F \).

#### **Step 3: Use Geometric Properties**
- The sum of the angles around a point is always \( 360^\circ \).
- If there are four equal angles \( x^\circ \) around point \( F \), then:
  \[
  x + x + x + x = 360^\circ
  \]
  Simplifying this equation:
  \[
  4x = 360^\circ
  \]

#### **Step 4: Solve for \( x \)**
- Divide both sides of the equation by 4:
  \[
  x = \frac{360^\circ}{4} = 90^\circ
  \]

#### **Step 5: Verify the Solution**
- If each angle \( x \) is \( 90^\circ \), then the total sum of the angles around point \( F \) is:
  \[
  90^\circ + 90^\circ + 90^\circ + 90^\circ = 360^\circ
  \]
- This confirms that the solution is consistent with the geometric properties.

### Final Answer:
The value of \( x \) is \( 90^\circ \).

\[
\boxed{C}
\]
