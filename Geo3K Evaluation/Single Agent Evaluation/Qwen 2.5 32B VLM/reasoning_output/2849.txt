### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a geometric figure with several lines and angles labeled. The key elements to note are:
- Angles **∠4** and **∠5** are adjacent angles formed by the intersection of two lines.
- The measures of these angles are given as algebraic expressions:
  - \( m\angle 4 = 2y + 32 \)
  - \( m\angle 5 = 3y - 3 \)

Since **∠4** and **∠5** are adjacent angles formed by intersecting lines, they are supplementary angles. This means their measures add up to 180°:
\[ m\angle 4 + m\angle 5 = 180^\circ \]

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. **Identify the Relationship Between the Angles:**
   From the image, we observe that **∠4** and **∠5** are supplementary angles. Therefore, their sum is:
   \[
   m\angle 4 + m\angle 5 = 180^\circ
   \]

#### 2. **Substitute the Given Expressions:**
   Substitute the expressions for \( m\angle 4 \) and \( m\angle 5 \):
   \[
   (2y + 32) + (3y - 3) = 180
   \]

#### 3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   2y + 3y + 32 - 3 = 180
   \]
   \[
   5y + 29 = 180
   \]

#### 4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   Isolate \( y \) by first subtracting 29 from both sides:
   \[
   5y = 180 - 29
   \]
   \[
   5y = 151
   \]
   Divide both sides by 5:
   \[
   y = \frac{151}{5}
   \]
   \[
   y = 30.2
   \]

#### 5. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   The calculated value of \( y \) is 30.2. However, the answer choices provided are:
   - A. 18
   - B. 35
   - C. 55
   - D. 72

   Since 30.2 does not exactly match any of the choices, we select the closest value. The closest value to 30.2 among the given choices is **35**.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
