### Problem Analysis:
The image shows two parallel lines \(a\) and \(b\) intersected by a transversal. The angles formed by the intersection are labeled as \((4x + 11)^\circ\) and \((8x + 1)^\circ\). These angles are corresponding angles because they are on the same side of the transversal and in the same relative position with respect to the lines \(a\) and \(b\).

For the lines \(a\) and \(b\) to be parallel, the corresponding angles must be equal. Therefore, we need to set up the equation:
\[
4x + 11 = 8x + 1
\]

### Thought Section:
1. **Identify the Geometric Relationship:**
   - The lines \(a\) and \(b\) are parallel.
   - The angles \((4x + 11)^\circ\) and \((8x + 1)^\circ\) are corresponding angles.
   - Corresponding angles are equal when the lines are parallel.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Since the angles are corresponding and the lines are parallel, we equate the expressions for the angles:
     \[
     4x + 11 = 8x + 1
     \]

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - Rearrange the equation to isolate \(x\):
     \[
     4x + 11 = 8x + 1
     \]
     Subtract \(4x\) from both sides:
     \[
     11 = 4x + 1
     \]
     Subtract 1 from both sides:
     \[
     10 = 4x
     \]
     Divide by 4:
     \[
     x = \frac{10}{4} = 2.5
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \(x = 2.5\) back into the expressions for the angles:
     \[
     4x + 11 = 4(2.5) + 11 = 10 + 11 = 21
     \]
     \[
     8x + 1 = 8(2.5) + 1 = 20 + 1 = 21
     \]
   - Both angles are equal, confirming that the lines are parallel when \(x = 2.5\).

5. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated value of \(x\) is \(2.5\).
   - The answer choices are:
     - A. 2.5
     - B. 14
     - C. 15
     - D. 16
   - The correct choice is A.

### Solution Section:
The value of \(x\) that ensures \(a \parallel b\) is:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
