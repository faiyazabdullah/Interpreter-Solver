### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a straight line \( DC \) with a point \( E \) on it. From point \( E \), a perpendicular line \( EB \) is drawn downward, meeting another line at point \( A \). The angle formed at \( E \) between the horizontal line \( DE \) and the vertical line \( EA \) is labeled as \( x^\circ \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Identify Given Information**
- The line \( DE \) is horizontal.
- The line \( EB \) is perpendicular to \( DE \).
- The angle \( \angle DEB \) is a right angle (90Â°).
- The angle \( x \) is formed between the horizontal line \( DE \) and the vertical line \( EA \).

#### **Step 2: Understand the Geometric Relationships**
- Since \( EB \) is perpendicular to \( DE \), \( \angle DEB = 90^\circ \).
- The line \( EA \) is vertical, meaning it is perpendicular to the horizontal line \( DE \).
- Therefore, the angle \( x \) is also a right angle because it is formed between a horizontal line and a vertical line.

#### **Step 3: Apply Geometric Properties**
- The angle between a horizontal line and a vertical line is always \( 90^\circ \).
- Hence, \( x = 90^\circ \).

#### **Step 4: Verify the Calculation**
- The angle \( x \) is explicitly defined by the perpendicular relationship between the horizontal and vertical lines.
- No additional calculations are needed since the problem directly involves the definition of perpendicular lines.

#### **Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated value of \( x \) is \( 90^\circ \).
- The answer choices are:
  - A. 45
  - B. 90
  - C. 180
  - D. 360

### Final Answer:
The correct answer is \( B \).

**Final Answer: B**
