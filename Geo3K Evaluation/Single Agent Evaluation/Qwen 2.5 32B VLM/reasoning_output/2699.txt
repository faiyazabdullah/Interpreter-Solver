### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the length of \( ND \) in the circle \(\odot X\). The given information includes:
- \( AB = 30 \)
- \( CD = 30 \)
- \( m\widehat{CZ} = 40^\circ \)

From the image, we observe:
- \( AB \) and \( CD \) are chords of the circle.
- \( M \) and \( N \) are midpoints of \( AB \) and \( CD \), respectively.
- \( \angle AMX = 90^\circ \) and \( \angle CNX = 90^\circ \), indicating that \( XM \perp AB \) and \( XN \perp CD \).
- \( \widehat{CZ} \) is an arc subtended by the chord \( CD \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understanding the Geometry**
- Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( AB \) and \( XM \perp AB \), \( XM \) is the perpendicular bisector of \( AB \). This means \( AM = MB = \frac{AB}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).
- Similarly, since \( N \) is the midpoint of \( CD \) and \( XN \perp CD \), \( XN \) is the perpendicular bisector of \( CD \). This means \( CN = ND = \frac{CD}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).

#### **Step 2: Using the Arc Information**
- The measure of the arc \( \widehat{CZ} \) is given as \( 40^\circ \). Since \( N \) is the midpoint of \( CD \), the arc \( \widehat{CN} \) is half of \( \widehat{CZ} \). Therefore, \( \widehat{CN} = \frac{40^\circ}{2} = 20^\circ \).

#### **Step 3: Relating Arcs to Chords**
- The length of \( ND \) is half the length of \( CD \) because \( N \) is the midpoint of \( CD \). Thus, \( ND = \frac{CD}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).

#### **Step 4: Verifying the Calculation**
- The length of \( ND \) is directly determined by the fact that \( N \) is the midpoint of \( CD \). The arc information \( m\widehat{CZ} = 40^\circ \) is used to confirm the symmetry and positioning but does not affect the direct calculation of \( ND \).

### Final Answer:
Based on the above reasoning, the length of \( ND \) is \( 15 \).

\[
\boxed{B}
