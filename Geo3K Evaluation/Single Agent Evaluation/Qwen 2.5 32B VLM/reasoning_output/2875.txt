### Problem Analysis:
The given geometric figure is a triangle \( \triangle SPQ \) with the following key features:
1. \( SR = RQ = 7 \), making \( SQ = SR + RQ = 14 \).
2. \( AP = PB \), indicating that \( P \) is the midpoint of \( AB \).
3. \( PQ = 9 \).
4. \( PR \perp SQ \), meaning \( PR \) is the altitude from \( P \) to \( SQ \).

We are tasked with finding the length of \( PS \).

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry
- The triangle \( \triangle SPQ \) is isosceles because \( SR = RQ \). This implies that \( \triangle SPQ \) has symmetry about the altitude \( PR \).
- Since \( PR \perp SQ \), \( PR \) bisects \( SQ \) into two equal segments, \( SR = RQ = 7 \). Therefore, \( R \) is the midpoint of \( SQ \).

#### Step 2: Using the Pythagorean Theorem
To find \( PS \), we can use the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle \( \triangle SPR \):
\[ PS^2 = PR^2 + SR^2 \]

#### Step 3: Finding \( PR \)
Since \( P \) is the midpoint of \( AB \) and \( PR \) is the altitude, we need to determine the height \( PR \). However, the problem does not directly provide the height. Instead, we can use the fact that \( \triangle SPQ \) is isosceles and the symmetry of the triangle.

#### Step 4: Applying the Isosceles Triangle Property
In an isosceles triangle, the altitude from the vertex to the base also acts as the median and the angle bisector. Therefore, \( PR \) splits \( \triangle SPQ \) into two congruent right triangles, \( \triangle SPR \) and \( \triangle QPR \).

#### Step 5: Calculating \( PS \)
Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle SPR \):
\[ PS^2 = PR^2 + SR^2 \]
We know:
- \( SR = 7 \)
- \( PQ = 9 \)

Since \( P \) is the midpoint of \( AB \) and \( PR \) is the altitude, we can use the relationship in the isosceles triangle to find \( PS \). However, the direct calculation of \( PR \) is not necessary because the symmetry and the given lengths allow us to infer the length of \( PS \).

#### Step 6: Using the Symmetry and Given Lengths
Given the symmetry and the fact that \( SR = RQ = 7 \), the length \( PS \) can be directly inferred from the properties of the isosceles triangle. The length \( PS \) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle \( \triangle SPR \), and since \( SR = 7 \) and the triangle is symmetric, \( PS = 7 \).

### Solution Section:

From the analysis, we can conclude that the length \( PS \) is equal to \( SR \), which is 7. Therefore, the length of \( PS \) is:
\[ PS = 7 \]

### Final Answer:
\[ \boxed{A} \]
