### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Analyze the given information
- The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with:
  - \( \angle C = 90^\circ \) (right angle).
  - \( \angle BAC = 70^\circ \).
  - The side opposite \( \angle BAC \) (hypotenuse) is labeled as \( x \).
  - The side adjacent to \( \angle BAC \) (one leg) is labeled as 15.

#### Step 2: Identify what needs to be found
- We need to find the length of the hypotenuse \( x \).

#### Step 3: Determine the relevant trigonometric relationship
- Since we know the angle \( \angle BAC = 70^\circ \) and the adjacent side (15), we can use the cosine function:
  \[
  \cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
  \]
  Here, \( \theta = 70^\circ \), the adjacent side is 15, and the hypotenuse is \( x \).

#### Step 4: Set up the equation
- Using the cosine formula:
  \[
  \cos(70^\circ) = \frac{15}{x}
  \]

#### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)
- Rearrange the equation to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  x = \frac{15}{\cos(70^\circ)}
  \]

#### Step 6: Calculate \( \cos(70^\circ) \)
- Using a calculator:
  \[
  \cos(70^\circ) \approx 0.3420
  \]

#### Step 7: Substitute and compute \( x \)
- Substitute \( \cos(70^\circ) \approx 0.3420 \) into the equation:
  \[
  x = \frac{15}{0.3420} \approx 43.86
  \]

#### Step 8: Compare with the answer choices
- The calculated value of \( x \) is approximately 43.86.
- The closest answer choice to 43.86 is D.

### Solution Section:

Based on the trigonometric relationship and calculations:

\[
x = \frac{15}{\cos(70^\circ)} \approx \frac{15}{0.3420} \approx 43.86
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{D}
\]

Final Answer: D
