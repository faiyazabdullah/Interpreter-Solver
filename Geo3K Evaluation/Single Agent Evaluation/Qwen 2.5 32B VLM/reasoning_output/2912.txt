### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Image and Identify Given Information
- The image shows a complex geometric figure with multiple lines, angles, and marked points.
- Key observations:
  - There are parallel lines labeled \( z \) and \( w \).
  - Several angles are labeled (e.g., \( \angle 1, \angle 2, \ldots, \angle 16 \)).
  - The problem states \( m\angle 12 = 64^\circ \).

#### Step 2: Understand What Needs to Be Found
- We need to find the measure of \( \angle 7 \).

#### Step 3: Identify Relevant Geometric Relationships
- Since \( z \) and \( w \) are parallel lines, we can use properties of parallel lines cut by a transversal:
  - Corresponding angles are equal.
  - Alternate interior angles are equal.
  - Consecutive interior angles are supplementary (sum to \( 180^\circ \)).
- Additionally, we need to analyze the relationships between the angles formed by the intersection of lines and the given angle measures.

#### Step 4: Focus on \( \angle 12 \) and Its Relationship to Other Angles
- \( \angle 12 \) is given as \( 64^\circ \).
- From the image, \( \angle 12 \) is part of a pair of consecutive interior angles with \( \angle 8 \) because they are on the same side of the transversal and between the parallel lines \( z \) and \( w \).
- Therefore, \( \angle 8 \) is also \( 64^\circ \) because corresponding angles are equal when the lines are parallel.

#### Step 5: Relate \( \angle 8 \) to \( \angle 7 \)
- \( \angle 7 \) and \( \angle 8 \) are vertical angles. Vertical angles are always equal.
- Therefore, \( m\angle 7 = m\angle 8 \).

#### Step 6: Verify the Calculation
- Since \( m\angle 8 = 64^\circ \) and \( \angle 7 \) is vertically opposite to \( \angle 8 \), it follows that \( m\angle 7 = 64^\circ \).

#### Step 7: Compare with Answer Choices
- The calculated measure of \( \angle 7 \) is \( 64^\circ \).
- The answer choices are:
  - A. 54
  - B. 64
  - C. 74
  - D. 84
- The closest and correct answer is \( 64 \).

### Solution Section

Based on the analysis and application of geometric properties:
1. \( \angle 12 = 64^\circ \).
2. \( \angle 8 = 64^\circ \) (corresponding angles).
3. \( \angle 7 = \angle 8 \) (vertical angles).

Thus, the measure of \( \angle 7 \) is \( 64^\circ \).
