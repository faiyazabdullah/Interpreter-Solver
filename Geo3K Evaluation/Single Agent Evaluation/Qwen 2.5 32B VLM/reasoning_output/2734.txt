### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with points \( B \), \( C \), and \( A \). Point \( D \) lies on the extension of side \( AB \), and arcs are drawn around points \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \). The arcs suggest that these points are equidistant from a common point (likely the center of a circle). The problem asks us to find the value of \( x \), which likely represents an angle or a related geometric quantity.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### **Step 1: Identify Given Information**
- \( \triangle ABC \) is a triangle.
- Point \( D \) lies on the extension of \( AB \).
- Arcs are drawn around points \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \), indicating that these points may lie on a circle or are related by some angular property.
- The goal is to find \( x \).

#### **Step 2: Interpret the Arcs**
The arcs around points \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \) suggest that these points are part of a cyclic configuration. Specifically:
- The arc around \( C \) suggests it is the vertex of an angle subtended by the chord \( BD \).
- The arcs around \( B \) and \( D \) imply that \( B \) and \( D \) are endpoints of the chord \( BD \).

#### **Step 3: Apply Geometric Properties**
The key property here is the **External Angle Theorem** for cyclic quadrilaterals. If points \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \) lie on a circle, then the external angle at \( D \) (formed by extending \( AB \)) is equal to the internal opposite angle at \( C \).

- Let \( \angle BCD = x \).
- Since \( D \) is on the extension of \( AB \), \( \angle BCD \) is an external angle to \( \triangle BCD \).
- The external angle \( \angle BCD \) is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent internal angles of \( \triangle BCD \).

However, without additional angle measures, we need to consider the symmetry and properties of the arcs. The arcs suggest that \( \angle BCD \) is likely a standard angle in a symmetric configuration, such as 60째 or 90째.

#### **Step 4: Use Symmetry and Standard Angles**
Given the symmetry and the presence of arcs, it is reasonable to assume that \( \angle BCD \) is a standard angle. Typically, in such problems, \( x \) is often 60째 or 90째 based on common geometric configurations.

- If \( \angle BCD = 60^\circ \), it fits the symmetry and the arc patterns.
- If \( \angle BCD = 90^\circ \), it would imply a right angle, which is less likely given the arcs.

#### **Step 5: Verify the Choice**
The most plausible value for \( x \) based on the given information and standard geometric configurations is \( 60^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
