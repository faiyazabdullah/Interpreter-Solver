### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves finding the value of \( x \) in the given geometric diagram. The diagram shows intersecting lines and streets labeled as Elm, Plum, and Oak, along with angles formed at their intersections. Here's a breakdown of the given information:

1. **Intersection Details**:
   - Streets Elm, Plum, and Oak intersect at points.
   - There is a marked angle of \( 55^\circ \) at the intersection involving Elm and Plum streets.
   - Another angle, \( x^\circ \), is shown at the intersection involving Plum and Oak streets.

2. **Geometric Relationships**:
   - The angles around a point sum up to \( 360^\circ \).
   - Vertically opposite angles are equal.
   - Adjacent angles forming a straight line sum up to \( 180^\circ \).

3. **Objective**:
   - Determine the value of \( x \) based on the given angle of \( 55^\circ \) and the properties of intersecting lines.

---

### Thought Section:
#### Step 1: Identify Key Angles and Relationships
- The angle marked as \( 55^\circ \) is part of the intersection of Elm and Plum streets.
- At the same intersection, there are vertically opposite angles, which are equal. Therefore, the angle vertically opposite to \( 55^\circ \) is also \( 55^\circ \).

#### Step 2: Use Adjacent Angles on a Straight Line
- At the intersection involving Plum and Oak streets, the angle \( x^\circ \) is adjacent to the \( 55^\circ \) angle (vertically opposite to the original \( 55^\circ \)).
- Since these angles form a straight line, their sum must be \( 180^\circ \):
  \[
  x + 55 = 180
  \]

#### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
- Rearrange the equation to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  x = 180 - 55 = 125
  \]

#### Step 4: Verify the Solution
- The angle \( x \) is indeed adjacent to the \( 55^\circ \) angle, and their sum is \( 180^\circ \), which satisfies the property of angles on a straight line.
- No other geometric relationships or additional angles affect the calculation of \( x \).

---

### Solution Section:
Based on the analysis and calculations:

1. The angle \( x \) is adjacent to the \( 55^\circ \) angle.
2. The sum of adjacent angles on a straight line is \( 180^\circ \).
3. Solving \( x + 55 = 180 \) gives \( x = 125 \).

Thus, the value of \( x \) is \( 125 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
