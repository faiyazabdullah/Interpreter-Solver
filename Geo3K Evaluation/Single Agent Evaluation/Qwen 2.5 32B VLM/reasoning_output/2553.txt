### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
- The image shows a geometric figure with intersecting lines and labeled angles.
- We are given:
  - \( m\angle 11 = 62^\circ \)
  - \( m\angle 14 = 38^\circ \)
- We need to find \( m\angle 1 \).

#### Step 2: Identify Key Geometric Relationships
1. **Vertical Angles**: When two lines intersect, vertical angles are congruent. For example:
   - \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 11 \) are vertical angles.
   - \( \angle 14 \) and another angle (to be identified) are also vertical angles.

2. **Supplementary Angles**: Adjacent angles formed by intersecting lines are supplementary if they form a straight line. For example:
   - \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 2 \) are supplementary because they lie on a straight line.

3. **Linear Pairs**: Angles that form a linear pair (adjacent and supplementary) add up to \( 180^\circ \).

#### Step 3: Use Vertical Angles
- Since \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 11 \) are vertical angles, they are congruent:
  \[
  m\angle 1 = m\angle 11
  \]
- Given \( m\angle 11 = 62^\circ \), it follows that:
  \[
  m\angle 1 = 62^\circ
  \]

#### Step 4: Verify Consistency with Other Angles
- \( \angle 14 \) is given as \( 38^\circ \). Since \( \angle 14 \) and \( \angle 13 \) are vertical angles, \( m\angle 13 = 38^\circ \).
- This does not affect the calculation of \( m\angle 1 \) directly, but it confirms the consistency of the diagram.

#### Step 5: Final Check
- The value of \( m\angle 1 \) is determined solely by the vertical angle relationship with \( \angle 11 \).
- No additional calculations are needed since the problem does not involve supplementary or other complex relationships for \( \angle 1 \).

### Solution Section

Based on the analysis:
- \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 11 \) are vertical angles.
- Therefore, \( m\angle 1 = m\angle 11 = 62^\circ \).

Comparing this with the answer choices:
- A. 38
- B. 42
- C. 62
- D. 80

The correct answer is \( \boxed{C} \).
