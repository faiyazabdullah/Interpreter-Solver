### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Image and Given Information
- The image shows a circle with a radius of \(2 \, \text{cm}\).
- There is a central angle marked as \(52^\circ\).
- The shaded region is a sector of the circle, defined by the central angle and the radius.

#### Step 2: Understand What Needs to Be Found
- We need to find the area of the shaded sector.
- The formula for the area of a sector of a circle is:
  \[
  \text{Area of sector} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi r^2
  \]
  where:
  - \(\theta\) is the central angle in degrees.
  - \(r\) is the radius of the circle.

#### Step 3: Identify Relevant Measurements
- The radius \(r\) is given as \(2 \, \text{cm}\).
- The central angle \(\theta\) is given as \(52^\circ\).

#### Step 4: Apply the Sector Area Formula
- Substitute the given values into the formula:
  \[
  \text{Area of sector} = \frac{52^\circ}{360^\circ} \times \pi \times (2)^2
  \]

#### Step 5: Simplify the Expression
1. Calculate the fraction \(\frac{52}{360}\):
   \[
   \frac{52}{360} = \frac{13}{90}
   \]

2. Square the radius:
   \[
   (2)^2 = 4
   \]

3. Multiply the fraction by \(\pi\) and the squared radius:
   \[
   \text{Area of sector} = \frac{13}{90} \times \pi \times 4
   \]

4. Simplify further:
   \[
   \text{Area of sector} = \frac{52\pi}{90} = \frac{26\pi}{45}
   \]

#### Step 6: Approximate the Result
- Use the approximation \(\pi \approx 3.14159\):
  \[
  \text{Area of sector} \approx \frac{26 \times 3.14159}{45}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Area of sector} \approx \frac{81.68134}{45} \approx 1.81514
  \]

#### Step 7: Round to the Nearest Tenth
- Rounding \(1.81514\) to the nearest tenth gives:
  \[
  1.8
  \]

#### Step 8: Compare with Answer Choices
- The calculated area is \(1.8\), which matches option B.

### Solution Section

Using the formula for the area of a sector:
\[
\text{Area of sector} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi r^2
\]
Substitute \(\theta = 52^\circ\) and \(r = 2 \, \text{cm}\):
\[
\text{Area of sector} = \frac{52}{360} \times \pi \times 4 = \frac{26\pi}{45}
\]
Approximating \(\pi \approx 3.14159\):
\[
\text{Area of sector} \approx \frac{26 \times 3.14159}{45} \approx 1.8
\]
Rounding to the nearest tenth:
\[
\text{Area of sector} \approx 1.8
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
