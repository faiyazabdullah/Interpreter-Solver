### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
- The problem provides the measures of two angles: \( m\angle 1 = 50^\circ \) and \( m\angle 3 = 60^\circ \).
- We need to find the measure of \( \angle 8 \).

#### Step 2: Identify Key Geometric Relationships
- The figure includes parallel lines and transversals. Specifically:
  - Lines \( j \) and \( q \) are parallel (indicated by the arrow symbols).
  - Lines \( p \) and \( k \) are also parallel.
- Angles formed by transversals intersecting parallel lines have specific relationships:
  - Corresponding angles are equal.
  - Alternate interior angles are equal.
  - Consecutive interior angles (same-side interior angles) are supplementary (sum to \( 180^\circ \)).

#### Step 3: Label and Relate Angles
- From the figure:
  - \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 2 \) are vertical angles, so \( m\angle 2 = m\angle 1 = 50^\circ \).
  - \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 4 \) are vertical angles, so \( m\angle 4 = m\angle 3 = 60^\circ \).
  - \( \angle 2 \) and \( \angle 5 \) are corresponding angles (since \( j \parallel q \)), so \( m\angle 5 = m\angle 2 = 50^\circ \).
  - \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 6 \) are corresponding angles (since \( j \parallel q \)), so \( m\angle 6 = m\angle 4 = 60^\circ \).
  - \( \angle 5 \) and \( \angle 8 \) are consecutive interior angles (same-side interior angles) along the transversal intersecting \( p \parallel k \).

#### Step 4: Use Supplementary Angle Property
- Consecutive interior angles are supplementary. Therefore:
  \[
  m\angle 5 + m\angle 8 = 180^\circ
  \]
- Substitute \( m\angle 5 = 50^\circ \):
  \[
  50^\circ + m\angle 8 = 180^\circ
  \]
- Solve for \( m\angle 8 \):
  \[
  m\angle 8 = 180^\circ - 50^\circ = 130^\circ
  \]

#### Step 5: Verify the Solution
- Double-check the relationships:
  - \( \angle 5 \) and \( \angle 8 \) are indeed consecutive interior angles.
  - The calculation \( 180^\circ - 50^\circ = 130^\circ \) is correct.

### Solution Section

Based on the analysis and calculations:

\[
m\angle 8 = 130^\circ
\]
