### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the length of \( NJ \) in the circle \(\odot M\). The given information includes:
- \( FL = 24 \)
- \( HJ = 48 \)
- \( m\widehat{HP} = 65^\circ \)

The image shows a circle with several chords, arcs, and perpendiculars. We need to use geometric properties and relationships to find \( NJ \).

---

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**
- The circle is centered at \( M \).
- \( FL \) and \( HJ \) are chords of the circle.
- \( FL \) is perpendicular to the radius \( ML \), and \( HJ \) is perpendicular to the radius \( MJ \).
- \( \widehat{HP} \) is an arc with measure \( 65^\circ \).

#### **Step 2: Use Perpendicular Chord Properties**
When a chord is perpendicular to a radius at its midpoint, the radius bisects the chord. Therefore:
- \( ML \) bisects \( FL \), so \( FL/2 = 24/2 = 12 \).
- \( MJ \) bisects \( HJ \), so \( HJ/2 = 48/2 = 24 \).

#### **Step 3: Analyze Arcs and Central Angles**
The measure of an arc is equal to the measure of its corresponding central angle. Since \( m\widehat{HP} = 65^\circ \), the central angle \( \angle HMP = 65^\circ \).

#### **Step 4: Relate Chords and Arcs**
The length of a chord in a circle can be related to the radius and the central angle subtended by the chord. However, we do not have the radius explicitly. Instead, we observe the symmetry and proportional relationships in the circle.

#### **Step 5: Use Proportional Relationships**
From the image, we see that \( FL \) and \( HJ \) are parallel chords (since both are perpendicular to radii). Parallel chords in a circle are equidistant from the center if they are equal in length. However, here \( HJ \) is twice the length of \( FL \).

Since \( HJ \) is twice the length of \( FL \), and both are symmetrically placed relative to the center \( M \), the chord \( NJ \) (which is part of the same configuration) will also follow this proportional relationship.

#### **Step 6: Determine \( NJ \)**
Given that \( HJ = 48 \) and \( FL = 24 \), and observing the symmetry and proportional relationships in the circle, we infer that \( NJ \) is equal to \( HJ \) because it is part of the same configuration and follows the same proportional rules.

Thus, \( NJ = HJ = 48 \).
