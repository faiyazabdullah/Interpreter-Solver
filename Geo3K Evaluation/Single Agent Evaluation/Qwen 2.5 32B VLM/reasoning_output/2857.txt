### Problem Analysis:
The image depicts a kite-shaped quadrilateral \( GJHF \) with the following key features:
- \( GA = AJ = 12 \)
- \( AH = HF = 15 \)
- The diagonals \( GH \) and \( FJ \) intersect at point \( A \), which is the midpoint of both diagonals (a property of kites).
- We need to find the length of diagonal \( GH \).

### Thought Section:
1. **Understanding the Kite Properties**:
   - In a kite, the diagonals are perpendicular to each other.
   - One diagonal (the shorter one) bisects the other diagonal.
   - Here, \( FJ \) is the longer diagonal, and \( GH \) is the shorter diagonal. Since \( A \) is the midpoint of both diagonals, \( GA = AJ = 12 \) and \( HA = AF = 15/2 = 7.5 \).

2. **Using the Perpendicular Diagonals Property**:
   - The diagonals \( GH \) and \( FJ \) are perpendicular at point \( A \). Therefore, \( \triangle GAH \) is a right triangle with:
     - \( GA = 12 \)
     - \( AH = 15 \)
     - \( GH \) is the hypotenuse of \( \triangle GAH \).

3. **Applying the Pythagorean Theorem**:
   - In \( \triangle GAH \):
     \[
     GH^2 = GA^2 + AH^2
     \]
     Substituting the known values:
     \[
     GH^2 = 12^2 + 15^2
     \]
     \[
     GH^2 = 144 + 225
     \]
     \[
     GH^2 = 369
     \]
     \[
     GH = \sqrt{369}
     \]

4. **Verification**:
   - The calculation is straightforward and uses basic properties of kites and right triangles.
   - The result \( \sqrt{369} \) matches one of the given answer choices.

5. **Comparison with Answer Choices**:
   - The calculated value \( \sqrt{369} \) directly corresponds to option D.

### Solution Section:
Based on the geometric properties of the kite and the application of the Pythagorean theorem, the length of \( GH \) is \( \sqrt{369} \).
