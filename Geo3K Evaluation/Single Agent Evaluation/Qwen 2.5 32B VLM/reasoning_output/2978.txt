### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
- The image shows a circle with center \( P \).
- The angle \( \angle MPL = 65^\circ \) is given.
- Line \( NP \) is perpendicular to line \( PL \), i.e., \( NP \perp PL \).
- We need to find the measure of the arc \( \widehat{NM} \).

#### Step 2: Understand Geometric Relationships
1. **Central Angles and Arcs**: 
   - The measure of an arc in a circle is equal to the measure of its corresponding central angle.
   - For example, if \( \angle MPL \) is a central angle, then the arc \( \widehat{ML} \) would have the same measure as \( \angle MPL \).

2. **Perpendicularity**:
   - Since \( NP \perp PL \), \( \angle NPL = 90^\circ \).
   - This implies that \( \angle NPM \) and \( \angle MPL \) together form a right angle at point \( P \).

3. **Sum of Angles at Point \( P \)**:
   - The total angle around point \( P \) is \( 360^\circ \).
   - However, we only need to focus on the angles involving \( N \), \( M \), and \( L \).

#### Step 3: Determine Key Angles
- Since \( \angle MPL = 65^\circ \), the arc \( \widehat{ML} \) also measures \( 65^\circ \).
- Because \( NP \perp PL \), \( \angle NPL = 90^\circ \).
- The angle \( \angle NPM \) can be determined as follows:
  \[
  \angle NPM = \angle NPL - \angle MPL = 90^\circ - 65^\circ = 25^\circ.
  \]

#### Step 4: Relate Angles to Arcs
- The arc \( \widehat{NM} \) corresponds to the central angle \( \angle NPM \).
- Therefore, the measure of arc \( \widehat{NM} \) is equal to the measure of \( \angle NPM \):
  \[
  m \widehat{NM} = \angle NPM = 25^\circ.
  \]

#### Step 5: Verify Consistency
- The arc \( \widehat{NM} \) is part of the circle, and its measure is consistent with the central angle \( \angle NPM \).
- The perpendicularity condition ensures that the angles are correctly distributed, and the calculation is valid.

### Solution Section

Based on the above reasoning:
- The measure of \( \angle NPM \) is \( 25^\circ \).
- Therefore, the measure of the arc \( \widehat{NM} \) is also \( 25^\circ \).

Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 25
- B. 45
- C. 65
- D. 90

The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{A}
\]
