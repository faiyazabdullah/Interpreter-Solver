### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a geometric figure with several lines and angles. Key observations from the image:
1. **Horizontal Line DY**: Contains points \( D \), \( Y \), and \( A \).
   - Angle at \( D \): \( (3x - 15)^\circ \)
   - Angle at \( Y \): \( (y + 25)^\circ \)
2. **Vertical Line HYG**: Intersects the horizontal line at point \( Y \).
3. **Point B** is the intersection of the horizontal line and another horizontal line containing points \( E \), \( B \), and \( J \).
   - Angle at \( B \): \( 105^\circ \).
4. **Point G** is connected to \( B \) and forms another angle with the horizontal line.

The goal is to find the value of \( y \).

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Identify Relationships Between Angles
- Since \( DY \) is a straight line, the sum of the angles along it must be \( 180^\circ \):
  \[
  (3x - 15)^\circ + (y + 25)^\circ = 180^\circ
  \]

#### Step 2: Solve for One Variable in Terms of Another
From the equation above:
\[
(3x - 15) + (y + 25) = 180
\]
Simplify:
\[
3x - 15 + y + 25 = 180
\]
\[
3x + y + 10 = 180
\]
\[
3x + y = 170 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

#### Step 3: Use Additional Information
The angle at \( B \) is given as \( 105^\circ \). Since \( B \) is on a horizontal line, the vertical line \( HYG \) creates a right angle with the horizontal line. This means the angle between the vertical line and the horizontal line is \( 90^\circ \).

#### Step 4: Relate Angles at Point \( Y \)
At point \( Y \), the vertical line \( HYG \) intersects the horizontal line \( DY \). The angle \( (y + 25)^\circ \) is part of the supplementary angle relationship with the \( 105^\circ \) angle at \( B \). However, we need more specific relationships to isolate \( y \).

#### Step 5: Revisit Equation 1
From Equation 1:
\[
3x + y = 170
\]
We need additional information to solve for \( x \) or directly find \( y \). However, the problem does not provide enough information about \( x \). Instead, we focus on the angle relationships directly involving \( y \).

#### Step 6: Use the Given Angle at \( B \)
The angle at \( B \) is \( 105^\circ \). Since \( B \) is on the horizontal line, the angle \( (y + 25)^\circ \) must be related to the supplementary angle formed by the vertical line. However, the direct relationship is through the straight line \( DY \).

#### Step 7: Solve for \( y \)
From the straight line \( DY \):
\[
(3x - 15) + (y + 25) = 180
\]
We do not have enough information to solve for \( x \) explicitly, but we can use the fact that the problem asks for \( y \) directly. Let's assume the problem intends for us to use the supplementary angle relationship more directly.

#### Step 8: Use Supplementary Angles
The angle \( (y + 25)^\circ \) is part of the supplementary angle with \( 105^\circ \). Therefore:
\[
(y + 25) + 105 = 180
\]
Simplify:
\[
y + 25 + 105 = 180
\]
\[
y + 130 = 180
\]
\[
y = 50
\]

---

### Solution Section:

From the analysis, the value of \( y \) is:
\[
y = 50
\]

Comparing this with the answer choices:
A. 30
B. 50
C. 60
D. 80

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
