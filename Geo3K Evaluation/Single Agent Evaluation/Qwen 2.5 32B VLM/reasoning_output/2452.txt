### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the measure of \( \angle 5 \) in the given geometric figure. The image shows a quadrilateral \( ABCD \) with diagonals intersecting at point \( E \). The angles around point \( E \) are labeled, and we are given specific angle measures:
- \( m\angle 1 = 58^\circ \)
- \( m\angle 2 = 47^\circ \)
- \( m\angle 3 = 26^\circ \)

The goal is to determine \( m\angle 5 \).

---

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Understand the Geometric Relationships
The figure shows a quadrilateral \( ABCD \) with diagonals \( AC \) and \( BD \) intersecting at point \( E \). At point \( E \), the diagonals form several pairs of vertical angles and supplementary angles.

- **Vertical Angles**: Vertical angles are congruent. For example, \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 7 \) are vertical angles, so \( m\angle 1 = m\angle 7 \).
- **Supplementary Angles**: Angles forming a linear pair are supplementary, meaning their measures sum to \( 180^\circ \).

#### Step 2: Identify Key Angle Relationships
From the image:
- \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 7 \) are vertical angles.
- \( \angle 2 \) and \( \angle 8 \) are vertical angles.
- \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 6 \) are vertical angles.
- \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 5 \) are part of a linear pair with \( \angle 6 \).

#### Step 3: Use Given Information
We are given:
- \( m\angle 1 = 58^\circ \)
- \( m\angle 2 = 47^\circ \)
- \( m\angle 3 = 26^\circ \)

Using the properties of vertical angles:
- \( m\angle 7 = m\angle 1 = 58^\circ \)
- \( m\angle 8 = m\angle 2 = 47^\circ \)
- \( m\angle 6 = m\angle 3 = 26^\circ \)

#### Step 4: Determine \( m\angle 5 \)
The angles around point \( E \) form a complete circle, so the sum of the angles around point \( E \) is \( 360^\circ \). However, we can focus on the linear pair involving \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 5 \):
- \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 5 \) are supplementary because they form a linear pair.
- \( \angle 4 \) is part of the triangle \( \triangle BEC \), and we know \( m\angle 3 = 26^\circ \) (which is \( m\angle 6 \)).

Since \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 5 \) are supplementary:
\[
m\angle 4 + m\angle 5 = 180^\circ
\]

To find \( m\angle 4 \), we use the fact that the sum of the angles in \( \triangle BEC \) is \( 180^\circ \):
\[
m\angle 2 + m\angle 3 + m\angle 4 = 180^\circ
\]
Substitute the given values:
\[
47^\circ + 26^\circ + m\angle 4 = 180^\circ
\]
\[
73^\circ + m\angle 4 = 180^\circ
\]
\[
m\angle 4 = 180^\circ - 73^\circ = 107^\circ
\]

Now, since \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 5 \) are supplementary:
\[
m\angle 4 + m\angle 5 = 180^\circ
\]
\[
107^\circ + m\angle 5 = 180^\circ
\]
\[
m\angle 5 = 180^\circ - 107^\circ = 73^\circ
\]

---

### Solution Section:

After calculating, we find:
\[
m\angle 5 = 73^\circ
\]

Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 43
- B. 47
- C. 58
- D. 73

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
