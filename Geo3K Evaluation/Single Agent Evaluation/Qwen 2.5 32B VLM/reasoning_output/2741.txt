### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the given information
- The problem states that pentagon $PQRST$ is **equilateral**, meaning all its sides are equal: $PQ = QR = RS = ST = TP$.
- The pentagon is **inscribed** in a circle $\odot U$, meaning all its vertices lie on the circumference of the circle.
- We need to find the measure of $\angle PSR$.

#### Step 2: Understand the properties of an equilateral pentagon inscribed in a circle
- Since the pentagon is both equilateral and cyclic (inscribed in a circle), it is also **regular**. This means all its internal angles are equal, and all its vertices divide the circle into equal arcs.
- For a regular pentagon, each central angle subtended by a side is:
  $$
  \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ.
  $$
- Each internal angle of a regular pentagon can be calculated using the formula for the interior angle of a regular polygon:
  $$
  \text{Interior angle} = \frac{(n-2) \cdot 180^\circ}{n},
  $$
  where $n$ is the number of sides. For a pentagon ($n = 5$):
  $$
  \text{Interior angle} = \frac{(5-2) \cdot 180^\circ}{5} = \frac{3 \cdot 180^\circ}{5} = 108^\circ.
  $$

#### Step 3: Identify the relationship between $\angle PSR$ and the pentagon
- $\angle PSR$ is an **external angle** formed by extending side $SR$ of the pentagon. In a regular pentagon, the external angle at any vertex is supplementary to the internal angle at that vertex.
- The internal angle at vertex $S$ is $108^\circ$. Therefore, the external angle $\angle PSR$ is:
  $$
  \angle PSR = 180^\circ - 108^\circ = 72^\circ.
  $$

#### Step 4: Verify the calculation
- The calculation is consistent with the properties of a regular pentagon. The external angle at any vertex of a regular pentagon is always $72^\circ$.
- This matches one of the given answer choices.

#### Step 5: Compare with the answer choices
- The calculated value of $\angle PSR$ is $72^\circ$.
- The answer choices are:
  - A. 36
  - B. 72
  - C. 120
  - D. 144
