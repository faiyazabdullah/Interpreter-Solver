### Problem Analysis:
The image depicts a semicircle with a shaded region. The diameter of the semicircle is labeled as \( x \) cm, and the area of the shaded region is given as \( A = 66 \, \text{cm}^2 \). We need to find the value of \( x \).

#### Key Observations:
1. The shaded region is a semicircle.
2. The diameter of the semicircle is \( x \), so the radius \( r \) is \( \frac{x}{2} \).
3. The area of a semicircle is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Area of semicircle} = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2
   \]
4. The given area of the shaded region is \( 66 \, \text{cm}^2 \).

### Thought Section:
#### Step 1: Express the area of the semicircle in terms of \( x \).
The radius \( r \) of the semicircle is \( \frac{x}{2} \). Substituting this into the area formula for a semicircle:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \pi \left( \frac{x}{2} \right)^2
\]
Simplify the expression:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \pi \left( \frac{x^2}{4} \right) = \frac{\pi x^2}{8}
\]

#### Step 2: Set up the equation using the given area.
We know the area of the shaded region is \( 66 \, \text{cm}^2 \). Therefore:
\[
\frac{\pi x^2}{8} = 66
\]

#### Step 3: Solve for \( x^2 \).
Multiply both sides of the equation by 8 to isolate \( \pi x^2 \):
\[
\pi x^2 = 528
\]
Divide both sides by \( \pi \):
\[
x^2 = \frac{528}{\pi}
\]

#### Step 4: Approximate \( \pi \) and solve for \( x \).
Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
\[
x^2 = \frac{528}{3.14159} \approx 168.07
\]
Take the square root of both sides to solve for \( x \):
\[
x \approx \sqrt{168.07} \approx 12.96
\]

#### Step 5: Compare with the given answer choices.
The calculated value of \( x \approx 12.96 \) is closest to the option \( 13.0 \).

### Solution Section:
The area of the shaded semicircle is given by:
\[
\frac{\pi x^2}{8} = 66
\]
Solving for \( x^2 \):
\[
x^2 = \frac{528}{\pi} \approx 168.07
\]
Taking the square root:
\[
x \approx \sqrt{168.07} \approx 12.96
\]
The closest answer choice to \( 12.96 \) is \( 13.0 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
