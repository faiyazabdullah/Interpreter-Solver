### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
- The problem states that \( P, Q, R, S \) form a rhombus inscribed in a circle.
- A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides of equal length.
- A key property of a rhombus inscribed in a circle is that it is also a square. This is because for a rhombus to be cyclic (inscribed in a circle), its opposite angles must sum to \( 180^\circ \). Since a rhombus has equal sides, the only way this can happen is if all its internal angles are \( 90^\circ \), making it a square.

#### Step 2: Understand the Question
- We need to find the measure of the arc \( \widehat{SP} \).
- In a circle, the measure of an arc is determined by the central angle subtending that arc.
- For a square inscribed in a circle, each side of the square subtends a central angle of \( 90^\circ \).

#### Step 3: Use Geometric Properties
- Since \( P, Q, R, S \) form a square, the circle is divided into four equal arcs, each corresponding to a side of the square.
- Each arc subtends a central angle of \( 90^\circ \).
- Therefore, the measure of arc \( \widehat{SP} \) is \( 90^\circ \).

#### Step 4: Verify the Calculation
- The square divides the circle into four equal parts, each part being a quarter of the circle.
- The measure of each arc is thus \( \frac{360^\circ}{4} = 90^\circ \).

#### Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices
- The calculated measure of \( \widehat{SP} \) is \( 90^\circ \).
- The answer choices are:
  - A. 30
  - B. 45
  - C. 60
  - D. 90
- The closest and correct answer is \( 90^\circ \).

### Solution Section

Based on the analysis and application of geometric properties:

1. The rhombus inscribed in a circle is actually a square.
2. Each side of the square subtends a central angle of \( 90^\circ \).
3. Therefore, the measure of arc \( \widehat{SP} \) is \( 90^\circ \).

Final Answer: **D**
