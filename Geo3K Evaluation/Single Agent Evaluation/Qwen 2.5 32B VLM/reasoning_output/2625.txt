### Problem Analysis:
We are given a rectangle \( DEFG \) with the following information:
- \( m\angle EFD = 2x - 3 \)
- \( m\angle DFG = x + 12 \)

We need to find the measure of \( \angle EFD \). Since \( DEFG \) is a rectangle, we know the following properties:
1. All interior angles of a rectangle are right angles (90°).
2. Adjacent angles in a rectangle sum to 90° because they form a right angle.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Identify the relationship between \( \angle EFD \) and \( \angle DFG \)**
In the rectangle \( DEFG \), \( \angle EFD \) and \( \angle DFG \) are adjacent angles forming the right angle at vertex \( F \). Therefore:
\[
m\angle EFD + m\angle DFG = 90^\circ
\]

#### **Step 2: Substitute the given expressions for the angles**
We are given:
\[
m\angle EFD = 2x - 3
\]
\[
m\angle DFG = x + 12
\]
Substitute these into the equation \( m\angle EFD + m\angle DFG = 90^\circ \):
\[
(2x - 3) + (x + 12) = 90
\]

#### **Step 3: Simplify the equation**
Combine like terms:
\[
2x - 3 + x + 12 = 90
\]
\[
3x + 9 = 90
\]

#### **Step 4: Solve for \( x \)**
Subtract 9 from both sides:
\[
3x = 81
\]
Divide by 3:
\[
x = 27
\]

#### **Step 5: Find \( m\angle EFD \)**
Now that we have \( x = 27 \), substitute it back into the expression for \( m\angle EFD \):
\[
m\angle EFD = 2x - 3
\]
\[
m\angle EFD = 2(27) - 3
\]
\[
m\angle EFD = 54 - 3
\]
\[
m\angle EFD = 51
\]

### Verification:
- Check the value of \( m\angle DFG \):
  \[
  m\angle DFG = x + 12 = 27 + 12 = 39
  \]
- Verify the sum:
  \[
  m\angle EFD + m\angle DFG = 51 + 39 = 90
  \]
The calculation is consistent with the property of adjacent angles in a rectangle.

### Final Answer:
The measure of \( \angle EFD \) is \( 51 \). Comparing this with the given answer choices, we select:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]

Final Answer: **A**
