### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the measure of \( \angle ADC \) in the parallelogram \( ABCD \). The image provides several angles and side lengths, but we need to focus on the properties of parallelograms and the given angles to solve the problem.

#### Key Properties of a Parallelogram:
1. Opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.
2. Opposite angles are equal.
3. Consecutive angles are supplementary (sum to \( 180^\circ \)).
4. Diagonals bisect each other.

From the image:
- \( \angle DAB = 20^\circ \)
- \( \angle ABC = 40.1^\circ \)
- \( \angle BCD = 32^\circ \)

We need to use these properties and the given angles to find \( \angle ADC \).

---

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the relationship between angles in a parallelogram.
In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, and consecutive angles are supplementary. Therefore:
- \( \angle DAB = \angle BCD \) (opposite angles)
- \( \angle ABC = \angle CDA \) (opposite angles)
- \( \angle DAB + \angle ABC = 180^\circ \) (consecutive angles)
- \( \angle BCD + \angle CDA = 180^\circ \) (consecutive angles)

#### Step 2: Use the given angles.
From the image:
- \( \angle DAB = 20^\circ \)
- \( \angle ABC = 40.1^\circ \)
- \( \angle BCD = 32^\circ \)

Since \( \angle DAB \) and \( \angle BCD \) are opposite angles in the parallelogram, they should be equal. However, the image shows different values, which suggests that the labels might be for specific parts of the figure rather than direct opposite angles. We will use the supplementary property for consecutive angles.

#### Step 3: Calculate \( \angle ADC \).
Using the supplementary property for consecutive angles:
\[ \angle DAB + \angle ABC = 180^\circ \]
\[ 20^\circ + 40.1^\circ = 60.1^\circ \]

This does not directly help us find \( \angle ADC \). Instead, we use the fact that \( \angle BCD \) and \( \angle CDA \) are consecutive angles:
\[ \angle BCD + \angle CDA = 180^\circ \]
\[ 32^\circ + \angle CDA = 180^\circ \]
\[ \angle CDA = 180^\circ - 32^\circ \]
\[ \angle CDA = 148^\circ \]

However, this does not match any of the answer choices. Let's re-evaluate the problem using the given angles and the properties of the parallelogram.

#### Step 4: Re-evaluate the problem.
The image shows a complex figure with multiple intersecting lines and angles. However, the key is to focus on the parallelogram \( ABCD \) and its properties. The angle \( \angle ADC \) can be found by considering the supplementary property of consecutive angles in the parallelogram.

Given:
- \( \angle DAB = 20^\circ \)
- \( \angle ABC = 40.1^\circ \)
- \( \angle BCD = 32^\circ \)

Using the supplementary property for consecutive angles:
\[ \angle DAB + \angle ADC = 180^\circ \]
\[ 20^\circ + \angle ADC = 180^\circ \]
\[ \angle ADC = 180^\circ - 20^\circ \]
\[ \angle ADC = 160^\circ \]

This still does not match any of the answer choices. Let's consider the possibility of a misinterpretation or a different approach.

#### Step 5: Consider the given answer choices.
The answer choices are:
A. 42
B. 52
C. 72
D. 128

Given the complexity of the figure and the properties of the parallelogram, the most reasonable approach is to use the supplementary property of consecutive angles. The closest match to our calculations is:
\[ \angle ADC = 180^\circ - 20^\circ = 160^\circ \]

However, this does not match any of the answer choices. Upon re-evaluation, the closest reasonable answer based on the given choices is:
\[ \angle ADC = 128^\circ \]

\[
\boxed{D}
\]
