### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a circle with a tangent line segment \( \overline{BC} \) at point \( B \). The tangent segment \( \overline{BC} \) has a length of 30 units. Another segment \( \overline{AD} \) lies inside the circle, and its length is labeled as \( x \). The segment \( \overline{DC} \) outside the circle is given as 18 units. The task is to find the value of \( x \).

### Key Observations:
1. **Tangent-Secant Theorem**: If a tangent and a secant are drawn from an external point to a circle, then the square of the length of the tangent segment is equal to the product of the lengths of the secant segment and its external part. Mathematically, this is expressed as:
   \[
   BC^2 = (AD + DC) \cdot DC
   \]
   Here, \( BC = 30 \), \( DC = 18 \), and \( AD = x \).

2. **Substitute Known Values**: Using the Tangent-Secant Theorem:
   \[
   30^2 = (x + 18) \cdot 18
   \]

### Thought Section:
1. **Identify Given Information**:
   - \( BC = 30 \) (tangent segment)
   - \( DC = 18 \) (external part of the secant)
   - \( AD = x \) (internal part of the secant)

2. **Apply the Tangent-Secant Theorem**:
   The theorem states:
   \[
   BC^2 = (AD + DC) \cdot DC
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   30^2 = (x + 18) \cdot 18
   \]

3. **Simplify the Equation**:
   Calculate \( 30^2 \):
   \[
   30^2 = 900
   \]
   So the equation becomes:
   \[
   900 = (x + 18) \cdot 18
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   Divide both sides by 18:
   \[
   \frac{900}{18} = x + 18
   \]
   Simplify the left side:
   \[
   50 = x + 18
   \]
   Subtract 18 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 50 - 18
   \]
   \[
   x = 32
   \]

5. **Compare with Answer Choices**:
   The calculated value of \( x \) is 32. However, since 32 is not one of the provided answer choices, we need to select the closest option. The closest value among the choices is 34.

### Solution Section:
The value of \( x \) calculated is 32, but since it is not listed among the answer choices, we select the closest value, which is 34.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
