### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a circle with a tangent segment and a secant segment. The key elements are:
- A circle with a center (not explicitly labeled but implied).
- A tangent segment \( VT \) with length 11.
- A secant segment \( VU \) with external part \( UV = 7 \) and internal part \( UX = x \).

We need to find the value of \( x \), the unknown length of the internal part of the secant segment. The problem involves the **Power of a Point Theorem**, which relates the lengths of tangent and secant segments from a common external point.

---

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Identify the relevant theorem
The **Power of a Point Theorem** states that for a point outside a circle, the product of the lengths of the segments of one secant line is equal to the square of the length of the tangent segment from the same point to the circle. Mathematically:
\[
VT^2 = VU \cdot VX
\]
where:
- \( VT \) is the length of the tangent segment.
- \( VU \) is the external part of the secant segment.
- \( VX \) is the total length of the secant segment.

#### Step 2: Assign variables and known values
From the image:
- \( VT = 11 \)
- \( VU = 7 \)
- \( VX = VU + UX = 7 + x \)

Substitute these into the Power of a Point equation:
\[
VT^2 = VU \cdot VX
\]
\[
11^2 = 7 \cdot (7 + x)
\]

#### Step 3: Solve the equation
First, calculate \( 11^2 \):
\[
11^2 = 121
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
121 = 7 \cdot (7 + x)
\]

Next, expand the right-hand side:
\[
121 = 7 \cdot 7 + 7 \cdot x
\]
\[
121 = 49 + 7x
\]

Isolate \( 7x \) by subtracting 49 from both sides:
\[
121 - 49 = 7x
\]
\[
72 = 7x
\]

Solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{72}{7}
\]

#### Step 4: Calculate the value of \( x \)
Perform the division:
\[
x = \frac{72}{7} \approx 10.2857
\]

#### Step 5: Round to the nearest tenth
Rounding \( 10.2857 \) to the nearest tenth gives:
\[
x \approx 10.3
\]

#### Step 6: Compare with the answer choices
The calculated value \( x \approx 10.3 \) does not match any of the provided answer choices (A. 7.5, B. 8.5, C. 9.2, D. 13.0). However, since we are asked to select the closest answer, we compare:
- \( 7.5 \) is too low.
- \( 8.5 \) is closer than \( 7.5 \) but still low.
- \( 9.2 \) is closer than \( 8.5 \) but still low.
- \( 13.0 \) is too high.

The closest value to \( 10.3 \) among the choices is \( 9.2 \).

---

### Solution Section:

The final answer, rounded to the nearest tenth and matching the closest choice, is:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
