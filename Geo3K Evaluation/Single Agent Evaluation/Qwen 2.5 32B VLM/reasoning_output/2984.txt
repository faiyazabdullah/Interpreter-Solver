### Problem Analysis:
The given image shows a quadrilateral \(WXYZ\) with labeled angles at vertices \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\). The problem asks us to find the measure of \(\angle Y\). Let's break down the given information and approach the problem step by step.

#### **Given Information:**
1. The angle at vertex \(X\) is labeled as \(a^\circ\).
2. The angle at vertex \(Y\) is labeled as \((a - 28)^\circ\).
3. The angle at vertex \(Z\) is labeled as \((a + 2)^\circ\).
4. The angle at vertex \(W\) is labeled as \(\left(\frac{1}{2}a + 8\right)^\circ\).

#### **Objective:**
We need to find the measure of \(\angle Y\), which is \((a - 28)^\circ\).

---

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Sum of Interior Angles of a Quadrilateral**
The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is always \(360^\circ\). Therefore, we can write the equation for the sum of the angles in quadrilateral \(WXYZ\):

\[
\angle X + \angle Y + \angle Z + \angle W = 360^\circ
\]

Substitute the given expressions for each angle:
\[
a + (a - 28) + (a + 2) + \left(\frac{1}{2}a + 8\right) = 360
\]

#### **Step 2: Simplify the Equation**
Combine like terms:
\[
a + a - 28 + a + 2 + \frac{1}{2}a + 8 = 360
\]

Group the \(a\) terms and the constant terms:
\[
\left(a + a + a + \frac{1}{2}a\right) + (-28 + 2 + 8) = 360
\]

Simplify the coefficients of \(a\):
\[
\left(3a + \frac{1}{2}a\right) + (-28 + 2 + 8) = 360
\]

Convert \(3a\) to a fraction to combine with \(\frac{1}{2}a\):
\[
\left(\frac{6}{2}a + \frac{1}{2}a\right) + (-28 + 2 + 8) = 360
\]

\[
\frac{7}{2}a + (-28 + 2 + 8) = 360
\]

Simplify the constants:
\[
-28 + 2 + 8 = -18
\]

So the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{7}{2}a - 18 = 360
\]

#### **Step 3: Solve for \(a\)**

Add 18 to both sides:
\[
\frac{7}{2}a = 378
\]

Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[
7a = 756
\]

Divide by 7:
\[
a = 108
\]

#### **Step 4: Find \(\angle Y\)**

The measure of \(\angle Y\) is given as \((a - 28)^\circ\). Substitute \(a = 108\):
\[
\angle Y = 108 - 28 = 80
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The measure of \(\angle Y\) is \(80^\circ\).

\[
\boxed{A}
\]
