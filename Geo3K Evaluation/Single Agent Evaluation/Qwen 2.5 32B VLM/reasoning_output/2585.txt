### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle PRQ \) with the following details:
- \( PQ = 17 \) (one leg of the triangle)
- \( RQ = 15 \) (hypotenuse of the triangle)
- \( RP = 8 \) (the other leg of the triangle)

The goal is to find the value of \( \sin P \) as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth. Recall that:
\[
\sin P = \frac{\text{opposite side}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In this triangle, \( \angle P \) is the angle opposite the side \( RQ \), and the hypotenuse is \( RQ \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the sides of the triangle
- The hypotenuse \( RQ = 15 \).
- The side opposite \( \angle P \) is \( PQ = 17 \).
- The side adjacent to \( \angle P \) is \( RP = 8 \).

#### Step 2: Use the definition of sine
The sine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Here:
\[
\sin P = \frac{\text{opposite side}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{PQ}{RQ}
\]

#### Step 3: Substitute the known values
From the image:
\[
\sin P = \frac{PQ}{RQ} = \frac{17}{15}
\]

#### Step 4: Calculate the decimal value
Perform the division:
\[
\frac{17}{15} \approx 1.1333
\]

#### Step 5: Round to the nearest hundredth
Rounding \( 1.1333 \) to the nearest hundredth gives:
\[
1.13
\]

#### Step 6: Compare with the answer choices
The calculated value \( 1.13 \) does not match any of the provided answer choices. However, upon re-examining the problem, it appears there might have been a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the sides. Let's revisit the triangle and ensure the correct trigonometric function is applied.

#### Re-evaluation:
Upon closer inspection, the side \( PQ \) is actually the leg of the triangle, not the hypotenuse. The correct interpretation is:
- Hypotenuse \( RQ = 15 \)
- Opposite side to \( \angle P \) is \( RP = 8 \)
- Adjacent side to \( \angle P \) is \( PQ = 17 \)

Thus, the correct calculation for \( \sin P \) should be:
\[
\sin P = \frac{\text{opposite side}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{RP}{RQ} = \frac{8}{15}
\]

#### Recalculate:
\[
\frac{8}{15} \approx 0.5333
\]

#### Round to the nearest hundredth:
\[
0.53
\]

### Final Answer:
The correct value of \( \sin P \) is \( 0.53 \).

\[
\boxed{B}
\]
