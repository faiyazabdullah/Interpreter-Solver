### Problem Analysis:
The given image shows a geometric figure involving a right triangle and an isosceles right triangle. Here are the key observations:

1. **Triangle \( \triangle ABC \)**:
   - \( AB \) is the height (denoted as \( y \)).
   - \( AC = 5 \) is the hypotenuse.
   - \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).

2. **Triangle \( \triangle ABD \)**:
   - \( \angle DBA = 45^\circ \).
   - This indicates that \( \triangle ABD \) is an isosceles right triangle because one angle is \( 45^\circ \) and another is \( 90^\circ \), making the third angle \( 45^\circ \).

3. **Objective**:
   - We need to find the value of \( y \), which is the height \( AB \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze \( \triangle ABD \)
- Since \( \triangle ABD \) is an isosceles right triangle, the legs \( AD \) and \( BD \) are equal.
- Let \( AD = BD = x_1 \). Using the properties of a 45-45-90 triangle:
  \[
  AB = x_1 \sqrt{2}
  \]
  Therefore, \( y = x_1 \sqrt{2} \).

#### Step 2: Relate \( \triangle ABC \) to the given hypotenuse
- In \( \triangle ABC \), \( AC = 5 \) is the hypotenuse.
- Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle ABC \):
  \[
  AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2
  \]
  Substituting \( AC = 5 \) and \( AB = y \):
  \[
  5^2 = y^2 + BC^2
  \]
  \[
  25 = y^2 + BC^2
  \]

#### Step 3: Use the relationship between \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle ABC \)
- From the isosceles right triangle \( \triangle ABD \), we know \( BD = x_1 \).
- Since \( D \) lies on the same horizontal line as \( B \) and \( C \), the total length \( DC = x \) can be split into \( BD \) and \( BC \):
  \[
  DC = BD + BC
  \]
  However, we do not need the exact value of \( x \) to solve for \( y \).

#### Step 4: Solve for \( y \) using the 45-45-90 triangle properties
- From the isosceles right triangle \( \triangle ABD \):
  \[
  AB = x_1 \sqrt{2}
  \]
  Since \( AD = BD = x_1 \), and \( AB \) is the height, we can directly use the relationship:
  \[
  y = x_1 \sqrt{2}
  \]

#### Step 5: Verify using the hypotenuse \( AC = 5 \)
- Substitute \( y = x_1 \sqrt{2} \) into the Pythagorean theorem:
  \[
  25 = (x_1 \sqrt{2})^2 + BC^2
  \]
  \[
  25 = 2x_1^2 + BC^2
  \]
  Since \( BC = x_1 \) (from the isosceles right triangle properties):
  \[
  25 = 2x_1^2 + x_1^2
  \]
  \[
  25 = 3x_1^2
  \]
  \[
  x_1^2 = \frac{25}{3}
  \]
  \[
  x_1 = \frac{5}{\sqrt{3}}
  \]
  However, this approach seems unnecessary since we can directly use the relationship from the 45-45-90 triangle.

#### Step 6: Direct Calculation of \( y \)
- From the 45-45-90 triangle properties:
  \[
  y = \frac{AC}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{5\sqrt{2}}{2}
  \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
