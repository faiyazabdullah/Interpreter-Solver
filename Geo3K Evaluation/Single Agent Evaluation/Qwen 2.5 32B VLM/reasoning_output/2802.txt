### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with a point \( D \) on line segment \( AB \). The angle \( \angle CAD \) is labeled as \( 92^\circ \), and there are tick marks indicating congruent segments. Specifically:
- \( AD = DC \)
- \( BC = CB \) (self-evident, but confirms symmetry)

We are tasked with finding the measure of \( \angle CAD \).

---

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Identify Given Information
- \( \angle CAD = 92^\circ \) is explicitly given.
- The tick marks indicate that \( AD = DC \), which means \( \triangle ADC \) is isosceles with \( AD = DC \).
- The tick marks also suggest symmetry in the construction, but they do not directly affect the calculation of \( \angle CAD \).

#### Step 2: Understanding the Question
The problem asks for the measure of \( \angle CAD \). Since \( \angle CAD \) is already given as \( 92^\circ \) in the image, there is no need for further calculation. The value is directly provided.

#### Step 3: Verify Consistency
- The isosceles property \( AD = DC \) implies that \( \triangle ADC \) has two equal base angles. However, this does not affect the measure of \( \angle CAD \), which is already given.
- The presence of tick marks confirms the symmetry but does not introduce new information about \( \angle CAD \).

#### Step 4: Match the Answer Choices
The given measure of \( \angle CAD \) is \( 92^\circ \). Comparing this with the answer choices:
- A. 22
- B. 44
- C. 66
- D. 92

The correct choice is \( D \).

---

### Solution Section:

The measure of \( \angle CAD \) is directly given as \( 92^\circ \) in the image. No additional calculations are needed because the angle is explicitly stated.

Final Answer: **D**
