### Problem Analysis:
We are given a geometric figure with several segments and parallel lines. The key information is:
- \( E B \parallel D C \)
- Several segment lengths are provided:
  - \( DE = 4 \)
  - \( DC = 5 \)
  - \( AB = x - 2 \)
  - \( AC = 5 \)
  - \( AG = 10 \)

We need to find the length of \( AB \).

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Understanding the Parallel Lines
The condition \( E B \parallel D C \) implies that \( \triangle AEB \sim \triangle ADC \) by the **Basic Proportionality Theorem (Thales' Theorem)**. This theorem states that if a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle intersecting the other two sides, it divides those sides proportionally.

#### Step 2: Identifying Similar Triangles
Since \( E B \parallel D C \), the triangles \( \triangle AEB \) and \( \triangle ADC \) are similar. Therefore, the corresponding sides are proportional:
\[
\frac{AE}{AD} = \frac{AB}{AC}
\]

#### Step 3: Finding Segment Lengths
From the figure:
- \( AD = DE + AE = 4 + AE \)
- \( AC = 5 \)
- \( AB = x - 2 \)

We need to express \( AE \) in terms of known quantities. Since \( E B \parallel D C \), the ratio of the segments on \( AD \) and \( AB \) must be equal:
\[
\frac{AE}{AD} = \frac{AB}{AC}
\]

#### Step 4: Setting Up the Proportion
Let \( AE = y \). Then:
\[
AD = DE + AE = 4 + y
\]
Using the similarity proportion:
\[
\frac{y}{4 + y} = \frac{x - 2}{5}
\]

#### Step 5: Solving for \( x \)
Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
5y = (x - 2)(4 + y)
\]
Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
5y = 4(x - 2) + y(x - 2)
\]
\[
5y = 4x - 8 + xy - 2y
\]
Rearranging terms:
\[
5y + 2y - xy = 4x - 8
\]
\[
7y - xy = 4x - 8
\]
Factoring out \( y \) on the left-hand side:
\[
y(7 - x) = 4x - 8
\]
Solving for \( y \):
\[
y = \frac{4x - 8}{7 - x}
\]

#### Step 6: Using Additional Information
We know \( AG = 10 \), but this does not directly affect the proportionality between \( \triangle AEB \) and \( \triangle ADC \). However, it confirms that \( G \) is a point on \( AC \), and the segments are consistent with the similarity.

#### Step 7: Testing Consistency
To find \( AB \), we need to ensure the proportionality holds. Since \( E B \parallel D C \), the ratio of the segments must be consistent. Given the problem's setup, we can test the provided answer choices to find the correct value of \( AB \).

### Solution Section:

#### Step 1: Test the Answer Choices
We are given the answer choices:
- A. 5
- B. 7.5
- C. 9.5
- D. 10

We need to find \( AB = x - 2 \). Let's test each choice:

- **Choice A: \( AB = 5 \)**
  \[
  x - 2 = 5 \implies x = 7
  \]
  Substitute \( x = 7 \) into the proportion:
  \[
  \frac{AE}{AD} = \frac{5}{5} = 1
  \]
  This implies \( AE = AD \), which is not possible since \( DE = 4 \).

- **Choice B: \( AB = 7.5 \)**
  \[
  x - 2 = 7.5 \implies x = 9.5
  \]
  Substitute \( x = 9.5 \) into the proportion:
  \[
  \frac{AE}{AD} = \frac{7.5}{5} = 1.5
  \]
  This implies \( AE = 1.5 \times DE \), which is consistent with the given segments.

- **Choice C: \( AB = 9.5 \)**
  \[
  x - 2 = 9.5 \implies x = 11.5
  \]
  Substitute \( x = 11.5 \) into the proportion:
  \[
  \frac{AE}{AD} = \frac{9.5}{5} = 1.9
  \]
  This implies \( AE = 1.9 \times DE \), which is not consistent with the given segments.

- **Choice D: \( AB = 10 \)**
  \[
  x - 2 = 10 \implies x = 12
  \]
  Substitute \( x = 12 \) into the proportion:
  \[
  \frac{AE}{AD} = \frac{10}{5} = 2
  \]
  This implies \( AE = 2 \times DE \), which is not consistent with the given segments.

#### Step 2: Select the Correct Answer
The only consistent choice is \( AB = 7.5 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
