### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with determining which condition would be sufficient to prove that line \( d \) is parallel to line \( XZ \). The image shows a transversal line passing through points \( B \), \( Y \), and \( A \), intersecting line \( XZ \) at points \( X \) and \( Z \). The angles formed are labeled as \( \angle 1 \), \( \angle 2 \), and \( \angle 3 \).

#### Key Concepts:
1. **Parallel Lines and Transversals**: When a transversal intersects two parallel lines, specific angle relationships are established:
   - Corresponding Angles are congruent.
   - Alternate Interior Angles are congruent.
   - Consecutive Interior Angles are supplementary.

2. **Identifying Angle Relationships**:
   - \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 3 \) are **corresponding angles** if \( d \parallel XZ \).
   - \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle Z \) could be related if they are corresponding or alternate interior angles.
   - \( \angle 2 \) and \( \angle X \) could be related if they are alternate interior angles.
   - \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle Z \) could be related if they are corresponding or alternate interior angles.

#### Given Information:
- The image shows a transversal intersecting two lines: \( d \) and \( XZ \).
- The angles \( \angle 1 \), \( \angle 2 \), and \( \angle 3 \) are formed by the transversal and the lines.

#### Goal:
Determine which condition guarantees that \( d \parallel XZ \).

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Analyze the Angle Relationships
To prove that \( d \parallel XZ \), we need to use one of the standard angle conditions for parallel lines:
1. **Corresponding Angles**: If corresponding angles are congruent, the lines are parallel.
2. **Alternate Interior Angles**: If alternate interior angles are congruent, the lines are parallel.
3. **Consecutive Interior Angles**: If consecutive interior angles are supplementary, the lines are parallel.

#### Step 2: Examine Each Option
Let us evaluate each answer choice based on the angle relationships:

##### Option A: \( \angle 1 \cong \angle 3 \)
- \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 3 \) are corresponding angles formed by the transversal and the lines \( d \) and \( XZ \).
- According to the Corresponding Angles Postulate, if corresponding angles are congruent, then the lines are parallel.
- Therefore, \( \angle 1 \cong \angle 3 \) is sufficient to prove \( d \parallel XZ \).

##### Option B: \( \angle 1 \cong \angle Z \)
- \( \angle 1 \) is an angle formed by the transversal and line \( d \), while \( \angle Z \) is an angle at point \( Z \) on line \( XZ \).
- There is no direct geometric relationship (such as corresponding, alternate interior, or consecutive interior angles) between \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle Z \) that guarantees parallelism.
- Therefore, \( \angle 1 \cong \angle Z \) is not sufficient to prove \( d \parallel XZ \).

##### Option C: \( \angle 2 \cong \angle X \)
- \( \angle 2 \) is an angle inside the triangle formed by the transversal and line \( d \), while \( \angle X \) is an angle at point \( X \) on line \( XZ \).
- There is no direct geometric relationship between \( \angle 2 \) and \( \angle X \) that guarantees parallelism.
- Therefore, \( \angle 2 \cong \angle X \) is not sufficient to prove \( d \parallel XZ \).

##### Option D: \( \angle 3 \cong \angle Z \)
- \( \angle 3 \) is an angle formed by the transversal and line \( d \), while \( \angle Z \) is an angle at point \( Z \) on line \( XZ \).
- There is no direct geometric relationship between \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle Z \) that guarantees parallelism.
- Therefore, \( \angle 3 \cong \angle Z \) is not sufficient to prove \( d \parallel XZ \).

#### Step 3: Conclusion
From the analysis, only Option A (\( \angle 1 \cong \angle 3 \)) directly uses a valid geometric property (corresponding angles) to prove that \( d \parallel XZ \).

---

### Solution Section:

Based on the analysis:
- Option A (\( \angle 1 \cong \angle 3 \)) is the only condition that guarantees \( d \parallel XZ \) using the Corresponding Angles Postulate.

Final Answer: **\boxed{A}**
