### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Problem and Given Information
We are tasked with finding the value of \( x \) such that \( GJ \parallel FK \). The given information includes:
- \( GH = x + 3.5 \)
- \( HJ = x - 8.5 \)
- \( FH = 21 \)
- \( HK = 7 \)

From the image, we observe:
- \( \triangle FGK \) is a larger triangle containing \( \triangle HGJ \).
- \( GJ \) and \( FK \) are line segments within these triangles.
- For \( GJ \parallel FK \), the triangles \( \triangle HGJ \) and \( \triangle HKF \) must be similar by the Basic Proportionality Theorem (also known as Thales' theorem).

#### Step 2: Apply the Basic Proportionality Theorem
The Basic Proportionality Theorem states that if a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle intersecting the other two sides, then it divides those sides proportionally. Mathematically, for \( GJ \parallel FK \):
\[
\frac{GH}{HF} = \frac{HJ}{JK}
\]

#### Step 3: Express \( JK \) in Terms of Known Quantities
From the given information:
- \( FH = 21 \)
- \( HK = 7 \)
Thus, \( FK = FH + HK = 21 + 7 = 28 \).

Since \( GJ \parallel FK \), \( J \) lies on \( FK \), and \( JK = FK - HJ \). However, we need to use the proportionality directly without explicitly calculating \( JK \).

#### Step 4: Set Up the Proportion
Using the proportionality condition:
\[
\frac{GH}{HF} = \frac{HJ}{HK}
\]
Substitute the given values:
- \( GH = x + 3.5 \)
- \( HF = 21 \)
- \( HJ = x - 8.5 \)
- \( HK = 7 \)

The proportion becomes:
\[
\frac{x + 3.5}{21} = \frac{x - 8.5}{7}
\]

#### Step 5: Solve the Proportion
Cross-multiply to solve for \( x \):
\[
(x + 3.5) \cdot 7 = (x - 8.5) \cdot 21
\]
\[
7x + 24.5 = 21x - 178.5
\]

Rearrange the equation to isolate \( x \):
\[
24.5 + 178.5 = 21x - 7x
\]
\[
203 = 14x
\]
\[
x = \frac{203}{14}
\]
\[
x = 14.5
\]

#### Step 6: Verify the Solution
Substitute \( x = 14.5 \) back into the expressions for \( GH \) and \( HJ \):
- \( GH = x + 3.5 = 14.5 + 3.5 = 18 \)
- \( HJ = x - 8.5 = 14.5 - 8.5 = 6 \)

Check the proportion:
\[
\frac{GH}{HF} = \frac{18}{21} = \frac{6}{7}
\]
\[
\frac{HJ}{HK} = \frac{6}{7}
\]

The proportions are equal, confirming that \( GJ \parallel FK \).

### Solution Section

The value of \( x \) that satisfies the condition \( GJ \parallel FK \) is \( 14.5 \).
