====================================================================================================
### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Analyze the given information
- The triangle \( \triangle EFG \) is equilateral. This means all sides are equal, and all internal angles are \( 60^\circ \).
- \( EH \) is given to bisect \( \angle E \). This means \( EH \) divides \( \angle E \) into two equal parts.
- We need to find the measure of \( \angle 2 \).

#### Step 2: Identify key properties of an equilateral triangle
- In an equilateral triangle, each internal angle is \( 60^\circ \). Therefore, \( \angle E = 60^\circ \).
- Since \( EH \) bisects \( \angle E \), it divides \( \angle E \) into two equal angles:
  \[
  \angle 1 = \angle 2 = \frac{\angle E}{2} = \frac{60^\circ}{2} = 30^\circ.
  \]

#### Step 3: Verify the relationship between \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 2 \)
- The problem states that \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 2 \) are labeled, and since \( EH \) is the angle bisector, \( \angle 1 = \angle 2 \).
- From the properties of angle bisectors, we know that \( \angle 1 = \angle 2 = 30^\circ \).

#### Step 4: Check for any additional constraints or relationships
- The angle \( 15x^\circ \) at \( \angle FHG \) is given, but it does not affect the calculation of \( \angle 2 \) because it is not directly related to the bisected angle \( \angle E \).
- The focus remains on the fact that \( EH \) bisects \( \angle E \), and the measure of \( \angle 2 \) is determined solely by this property.

#### Step 5: Confirm the value of \( \angle 2 \)
- Based on the properties of angle bisectors and the equilateral triangle, we have:
  \[
  \angle 2 = 30^\circ.
  \]

### Solution Section:

From the analysis, we have determined that \( \angle 2 = 30^\circ \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:

- A. 15
- B. 30
- C. 45
- D. 60

The correct answer is \( 30 \).

Final Answer: **B**
