### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the given image and extract information
- The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with:
  - A right angle at \( B \) (indicated by the square symbol).
  - One leg \( BC = 24 \).
  - The hypotenuse \( AC = 74 \).
  - The other leg \( AB = x \), which we need to find.

#### Step 2: Understand the problem
We are asked to use a **Pythagorean Triple** to find \( x \). A Pythagorean Triple consists of three positive integers \( (a, b, c) \) that satisfy the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\]
Here, \( c \) is the hypotenuse, and \( a \) and \( b \) are the legs of the right triangle. Our goal is to identify a Pythagorean Triple that fits the given values and solve for \( x \).

#### Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean theorem
The Pythagorean theorem for \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[
AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
x^2 + 24^2 = 74^2
\]

#### Step 4: Calculate the squares
- \( 24^2 = 576 \)
- \( 74^2 = 5476 \)

Substitute these into the equation:
\[
x^2 + 576 = 5476
\]

#### Step 5: Solve for \( x^2 \)
Rearrange the equation to isolate \( x^2 \):
\[
x^2 = 5476 - 576
\]
\[
x^2 = 4900
\]

#### Step 6: Solve for \( x \)
Take the square root of both sides:
\[
x = \sqrt{4900}
\]
\[
x = 70
\]

#### Step 7: Verify the solution
Check if \( (24, 70, 74) \) forms a Pythagorean Triple:
\[
24^2 + 70^2 = 576 + 4900 = 5476 = 74^2
\]
The equation holds true, confirming that \( (24, 70, 74) \) is indeed a Pythagorean Triple.

#### Step 8: Compare with the answer choices
The calculated value of \( x \) is 70. Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 66
- B. 68
- C. 70
- D. 72

The closest and exact match is \( 70 \).

### Solution Section

Based on the detailed analysis and calculations:
\[
x = 70
\]

Final Answer: **C**
