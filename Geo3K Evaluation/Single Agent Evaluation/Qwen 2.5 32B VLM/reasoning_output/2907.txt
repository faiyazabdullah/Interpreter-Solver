### Problem Analysis:
The problem asks us to find the measure of angle \( \angle JKL \). Let's break down the given information and analyze the geometric relationships step by step.

#### Key Observations from the Image:
1. **Angle \( \angle KLM \)**: It is marked as a right angle (\( 90^\circ \)).
2. **Angle \( \angle MKL \)**: It is given as \( 37^\circ \).
3. **Perpendicular Lines**: 
   - Line \( JK \) is perpendicular to line \( KL \), indicated by the right-angle symbol at point \( J \).
   - Line \( LM \) is perpendicular to line \( KB \), indicated by the right-angle symbol at point \( M \).

#### Goal:
We need to determine the measure of \( \angle JKL \).

---

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Analyze the Right Angles
- Since \( JK \perp KL \), we know that \( \angle JKL = 90^\circ \).
- However, the problem asks for the specific measure of \( \angle JKL \), which might involve considering the relationship between \( \angle JKL \) and other angles in the figure.

#### Step 2: Use the Right Triangle \( \triangle KLM \)
- In \( \triangle KLM \):
  - \( \angle KLM = 90^\circ \) (right angle).
  - \( \angle MKL = 37^\circ \) (given).
  - The third angle, \( \angle KML \), can be calculated using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \):
    \[
    \angle KML = 180^\circ - \angle KLM - \angle MKL = 180^\circ - 90^\circ - 37^\circ = 53^\circ.
    \]

#### Step 3: Relate \( \angle JKL \) to Other Angles
- Since \( JK \perp KL \), \( \angle JKL = 90^\circ \). However, we need to consider the orientation of \( \angle JKL \) relative to the other angles.
- Notice that \( \angle JKL \) is part of the larger configuration involving \( \angle MKL \) and \( \angle KML \).

#### Step 4: Use the Linear Pair Property
- The angle \( \angle JKL \) is adjacent to \( \angle MKL \) along the straight line \( KL \).
- Therefore, \( \angle JKL \) is complementary to \( \angle MKL \) in the context of the right angle formed by \( JK \perp KL \).

#### Step 5: Calculate \( \angle JKL \)
- Since \( JK \perp KL \), the total angle at \( K \) is split into \( \angle JKL \) and \( \angle MKL \).
- Given \( \angle MKL = 37^\circ \), the remaining angle \( \angle JKL \) must be:
  \[
  \angle JKL = 90^\circ - \angle MKL = 90^\circ - 37^\circ = 53^\circ.
  \]

---

### Solution Section:

Based on the analysis:
- \( \angle JKL \) is complementary to \( \angle MKL \) because \( JK \perp KL \).
- Therefore, \( \angle JKL = 90^\circ - 37^\circ = 53^\circ \).

Comparing this result with the given answer choices:
- A. 35
- B. 37
- C. 53
- D. 73

The correct answer is \( 53^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
