### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the measure of \( \angle 6 \) in the given geometric figure. The problem provides the following information:
- \( m\angle 1 = 50^\circ \)
- \( m\angle 3 = 60^\circ \)

The figure includes parallel lines, transversals, and triangles, which suggests we will use properties of parallel lines, corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and triangle angle sum properties to solve the problem.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Identify Key Elements and Relationships**
1. **Parallel Lines and Transversals:**
   - The lines labeled \( j \), \( k \), and \( l \) appear to be parallel (indicated by the arrow markings).
   - The lines \( p \) and \( q \) are also parallel.
   - The transversals intersect these parallel lines, creating corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and other angle relationships.

2. **Given Angles:**
   - \( \angle 1 = 50^\circ \)
   - \( \angle 3 = 60^\circ \)

3. **Objective:**
   - Find \( m\angle 6 \).

#### **Step 2: Use Angle Properties of Parallel Lines**
- Since \( j \parallel k \parallel l \) and \( p \parallel q \), we can use the properties of angles formed by transversals intersecting parallel lines:
  - Corresponding angles are equal.
  - Alternate interior angles are equal.
  - Consecutive interior angles are supplementary (sum to \( 180^\circ \)).

#### **Step 3: Analyze \( \angle 1 \) and Its Relationships**
- \( \angle 1 \) is located at the intersection of the transversal with line \( j \).
- Since \( j \parallel k \), the corresponding angle to \( \angle 1 \) on line \( k \) is also \( 50^\circ \). Let's call this angle \( \angle 2 \):
  \[
  m\angle 2 = 50^\circ
  \]

#### **Step 4: Analyze \( \angle 3 \) and Its Relationships**
- \( \angle 3 \) is located at the intersection of the transversal with line \( k \).
- Since \( k \parallel l \), the corresponding angle to \( \angle 3 \) on line \( l \) is also \( 60^\circ \). Let's call this angle \( \angle 4 \):
  \[
  m\angle 4 = 60^\circ
  \]

#### **Step 5: Determine \( \angle 5 \) Using Triangle Sum Property**
- Consider the triangle formed by the points where the transversal intersects lines \( k \) and \( l \). The angles in this triangle are \( \angle 2 \), \( \angle 4 \), and \( \angle 5 \).
- The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is \( 180^\circ \):
  \[
  m\angle 2 + m\angle 4 + m\angle 5 = 180^\circ
  \]
- Substitute the known values:
  \[
  50^\circ + 60^\circ + m\angle 5 = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  110^\circ + m\angle 5 = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  m\angle 5 = 70^\circ
  \]

#### **Step 6: Relate \( \angle 5 \) to \( \angle 6 \)**
- \( \angle 5 \) and \( \angle 6 \) are vertical angles (formed by the intersection of two lines).
- Vertical angles are congruent:
  \[
  m\angle 6 = m\angle 5 = 70^\circ
  \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
