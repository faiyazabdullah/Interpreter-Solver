### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a geometric figure with multiple parallel lines and transversals. The goal is to find the value of \( y \). Here's a breakdown of the given information:

1. **Parallel Lines**: The horizontal lines are parallel to each other.
2. **Transversals**: Several vertical and diagonal lines act as transversals.
3. **Given Measurements**:
   - Top line segment: \( 20 - 5x \)
   - Middle line segment: \( 2x + 6 \)
   - Bottom line segment: \( \frac{3}{5}y + 2 \)
   - Rightmost vertical segment: \( y \)

The key observation is that the segments on the same transversal are equal because the lines are parallel. This implies that corresponding segments on parallel lines are proportional.

### Thought Section:
#### Step 1: Identify Corresponding Segments
From the image, we can see that the segments on the top, middle, and bottom lines are corresponding due to the parallel nature of the lines. Therefore, the lengths of these segments must be equal.

#### Step 2: Set Up Equations
- **Top Line**: The total length of the top line is split into two segments: \( 20 - 5x \) and \( y \).
- **Middle Line**: The total length of the middle line is split into two segments: \( 2x + 6 \) and \( y \).
- **Bottom Line**: The total length of the bottom line is split into two segments: \( \frac{3}{5}y + 2 \) and \( y \).

Since the lines are parallel, the segments on the same transversal must be equal. However, the problem does not provide direct equality between segments but rather proportional relationships. We need to use the fact that the segments are consistent across the transversals.

#### Step 3: Use Proportional Relationships
The segments on the same transversal must be consistent. Let's focus on the rightmost vertical segment \( y \). Since the lines are parallel, the segments on the same transversal are proportional. We can set up the following relationship based on the segments:

- The total length of the top line is \( 20 - 5x + y \).
- The total length of the middle line is \( 2x + 6 + y \).
- The total length of the bottom line is \( \frac{3}{5}y + 2 + y \).

However, the problem simplifies to finding \( y \) directly by focusing on the relationship between the segments on the same transversal. Specifically, the segments \( 2x + 6 \) and \( \frac{3}{5}y + 2 \) are part of the same transversal and must be consistent with the overall structure.

#### Step 4: Solve for \( y \)
We need to find a consistent value for \( y \). Let's use the relationship between the segments on the same transversal. The simplest approach is to use the fact that the segments are consistent and solve for \( y \) directly.

From the image, we can infer that the segments on the same transversal are proportional. Specifically, the segment \( y \) is consistent across the lines. We can set up the following equation based on the proportional relationship:

\[ y = \frac{3}{5}y + 2 \]

#### Step 5: Solve the Equation
Solve the equation \( y = \frac{3}{5}y + 2 \):

1. Subtract \( \frac{3}{5}y \) from both sides:
   \[
   y - \frac{3}{5}y = 2
   \]
2. Combine like terms:
   \[
   \frac{5}{5}y - \frac{3}{5}y = 2 \implies \frac{2}{5}y = 2
   \]
3. Solve for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 2 \cdot \frac{5}{2} = 5
   \]

### Solution Section:
The value of \( y \) is \( 5 \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:

- A. 3
- B. 4.5
- C. 5
- D. 6

The correct answer is \( C \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
