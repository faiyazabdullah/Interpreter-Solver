### Problem Analysis:
The image depicts a pentagon (a five-sided polygon) labeled as \(ABCDE\). The problem states that the **perimeter** of this polygon is 60 centimeters. We are tasked with finding the length of one side of the polygon. 

#### Key Observations from the Image:
1. The polygon has five sides: \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), \(DE\), and \(EA\).
2. All sides appear to be of equal length, as indicated by the small tick marks on each side. This suggests the polygon is a **regular pentagon** (all sides and angles are equal).

#### Known Information:
- Perimeter of the pentagon = 60 cm.
- A regular pentagon has all sides of equal length.

#### Goal:
To find the length of one side of the pentagon.

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Understanding the Perimeter Formula for a Regular Polygon
The perimeter \(P\) of a regular polygon with \(n\) sides, each of length \(s\), is given by:
\[
P = n \cdot s
\]
Here:
- \(P = 60\) cm (given),
- \(n = 5\) (since it is a pentagon),
- \(s\) is the length of one side (to be determined).

#### Step 2: Substitute Known Values into the Formula
Using the formula \(P = n \cdot s\):
\[
60 = 5 \cdot s
\]

#### Step 3: Solve for \(s\)
Rearrange the equation to solve for \(s\):
\[
s = \frac{60}{5} = 12
\]

#### Step 4: Verify the Solution
- If each side of the pentagon is 12 cm, then the total perimeter would be:
\[
5 \cdot 12 = 60 \text{ cm}
\]
This matches the given perimeter, confirming the calculation is correct.

#### Step 5: Match the Solution to the Answer Choices
The calculated length of one side is 12 cm. Comparing this with the provided answer choices:
- A. 12
- B. 15
- C. 30
- D. 60

The correct answer is **A. 12**.

### Solution Section:

The length of one side of the pentagon is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]

Final Answer: **A**
