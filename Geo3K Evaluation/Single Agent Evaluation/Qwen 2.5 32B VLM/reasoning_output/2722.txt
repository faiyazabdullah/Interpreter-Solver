### Problem Analysis:
The image shows two triangles that are similar. The key information provided includes:
1. The sides of the left triangle: 12, 20, and \(2x\).
2. The sides of the right triangle: 12, 15, and \(y + 4\).

Since the triangles are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional. We need to use this property to find the value of \(y\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Identify Corresponding Sides**
From the image, we can see that:
- The side of length 12 in both triangles corresponds to each other.
- The side of length 20 in the left triangle corresponds to the side of length 15 in the right triangle.
- The side of length \(2x\) in the left triangle corresponds to the side of length \(y + 4\) in the right triangle.

#### **Step 2: Set Up Proportions**
Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal. We can write the proportion based on the sides we identified:
\[
\frac{\text{Side in left triangle}}{\text{Corresponding side in right triangle}} = \text{Constant ratio}
\]

Using the sides 20 and 15:
\[
\frac{20}{15} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

This ratio must hold for all corresponding sides. Therefore, we can set up the proportion for the other pair of corresponding sides (\(2x\) and \(y + 4\)):
\[
\frac{2x}{y + 4} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

#### **Step 3: Solve for \(x\)**
We also have another pair of corresponding sides (12 and 12), which confirms the similarity but does not provide new information. Instead, we use the proportion involving \(2x\) and \(y + 4\).

From the proportion:
\[
\frac{2x}{y + 4} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
3 \cdot 2x = 4 \cdot (y + 4)
\]
\[
6x = 4(y + 4)
\]
\[
6x = 4y + 16
\]

#### **Step 4: Use the Given Information to Solve for \(y\)**
We need to find the value of \(y\). However, we do not have enough information to solve for \(x\) directly. Instead, we use the fact that the triangles are similar and the ratio of the sides must be consistent.

From the earlier ratio \(\frac{20}{15} = \frac{4}{3}\), we know the scale factor between the triangles is \(\frac{4}{3}\). This means every side in the left triangle is \(\frac{4}{3}\) times the corresponding side in the right triangle.

Using the side \(y + 4\) in the right triangle and its corresponding side \(2x\) in the left triangle:
\[
2x = \frac{4}{3}(y + 4)
\]

We already derived this equation:
\[
6x = 4y + 16
\]

#### **Step 5: Solve for \(y\) Using the Scale Factor**
Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of the sides must be consistent. We can use the known sides to find \(y\). From the proportion:
\[
\frac{20}{15} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

This confirms the scale factor. Now, using the side \(y + 4\) in the right triangle and its corresponding side \(2x\) in the left triangle:
\[
2x = \frac{4}{3}(y + 4)
\]

We can solve for \(y\) by substituting the known values. Since the scale factor is \(\frac{4}{3}\), we can directly use the relationship:
\[
y + 4 = \frac{3}{4} \cdot 2x
\]

However, we need to find a consistent value for \(y\). Using the proportion:
\[
\frac{2x}{y + 4} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Substitute \(2x = \frac{4}{3}(y + 4)\):
\[
\frac{\frac{4}{3}(y + 4)}{y + 4} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

This confirms the proportion. Solving for \(y\):
\[
6x = 4y + 16
\]

Since \(x\) is not explicitly needed, we can directly solve for \(y\) using the given choices. Testing the options:

#### **Step 6: Test the Answer Choices**
- For \(y = 5\):
  \[
  y + 4 = 9
  \]
  \[
  \frac{2x}{9} = \frac{4}{3} \implies 2x = 12 \implies x = 6
  \]
  This is consistent with the scale factor.

- For \(y = 12\):
  \[
  y + 4 = 16
  \]
  \[
  \frac{2x}{16} = \frac{4}{3} \implies 2x = \frac{64}{3}
  \]
  This is not consistent.

- For \(y = 15\):
  \[
  y + 4 = 19
  \]
  \[
  \frac{2x}{19} = \frac{4}{3} \implies 2x = \frac{76}{3}
  \]
  This is not consistent.

- For \(y = 20\):
  \[
  y + 4 = 24
  \]
  \[
  \frac{2x}{24} = \frac{4}{3} \implies 2x = 32 \implies x = 16
  \]
  This is not consistent with the scale factor.

#### **Step 7: Final Answer**
The correct value of \(y\) that satisfies the proportion and the scale factor is \(y = 5\).

\[
\boxed{A}
\]
