### Problem Analysis:
The given image shows a parallelogram \( FGHJ \) with diagonals intersecting at point \( A \). The lengths of the segments of the diagonals are expressed in terms of variables \( w \) and \( b \). The key property of a parallelogram is that its diagonals bisect each other. This means that the segments created by the intersection of the diagonals are equal in length.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Identify the given information**
- The diagonals of the parallelogram are \( FG \) and \( JH \).
- The diagonals intersect at point \( A \), which is the midpoint of both diagonals.
- The segments of diagonal \( FG \) are:
  - \( FA = 4w - 7 \)
  - \( AG = 2b + 5 \)
- The segments of diagonal \( JH \) are:
  - \( JA = 3b + 1 \)
  - \( AH = 2w + 3 \)

#### **Step 2: Apply the property of diagonals in a parallelogram**
Since the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other, the following relationships hold:
1. \( FA = AG \)
2. \( JA = AH \)

#### **Step 3: Set up equations based on the bisecting property**
From the first relationship \( FA = AG \):
\[
4w - 7 = 2b + 5
\]

From the second relationship \( JA = AH \):
\[
3b + 1 = 2w + 3
\]

#### **Step 4: Solve the system of equations**
We now have two equations:
1. \( 4w - 7 = 2b + 5 \)
2. \( 3b + 1 = 2w + 3 \)

##### Solve the first equation for \( b \):
\[
4w - 7 = 2b + 5
\]
\[
4w - 12 = 2b
\]
\[
2w - 6 = b
\]
\[
b = 2w - 6
\]

##### Substitute \( b = 2w - 6 \) into the second equation:
\[
3b + 1 = 2w + 3
\]
\[
3(2w - 6) + 1 = 2w + 3
\]
\[
6w - 18 + 1 = 2w + 3
\]
\[
6w - 17 = 2w + 3
\]
\[
6w - 2w = 3 + 17
\]
\[
4w = 20
\]
\[
w = 5
\]

#### **Step 5: Verify the solution**
Substitute \( w = 5 \) back into the expressions for the segments to ensure consistency:
- \( FA = 4w - 7 = 4(5) - 7 = 20 - 7 = 13 \)
- \( AG = 2b + 5 = 2(2w - 6) + 5 = 2(2(5) - 6) + 5 = 2(10 - 6) + 5 = 2(4) + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13 \)
- \( JA = 3b + 1 = 3(2w - 6) + 1 = 3(2(5) - 6) + 1 = 3(10 - 6) + 1 = 3(4) + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13 \)
- \( AH = 2w + 3 = 2(5) + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13 \)

All segments are equal, confirming that the solution is consistent.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
