### Thought Section

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given a square \(ABDC\) inscribed in a circle \(\odot K\).
   - The task is to find the measure of a central angle of the circle.

2. **Analyzing the Image**:
   - The square \(ABDC\) is inscribed in the circle, meaning all four vertices of the square lie on the circumference of the circle.
   - The center of the circle is also the center of the square.
   - A central angle is an angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle, and its sides pass through two points on the circumference.

3. **Key Geometric Properties**:
   - In a square inscribed in a circle, the diagonals of the square are diameters of the circle.
   - The diagonals of a square bisect each other at right angles (90°).
   - The circle is symmetric, and the central angles subtended by the sides of the square are equal.

4. **Identifying Central Angles**:
   - Since the square is inscribed, each side of the square subtends a central angle at the center of the circle.
   - A full circle is \(360^\circ\), and since the square has 4 equal sides, the central angle subtended by each side is:
     \[
     \frac{360^\circ}{4} = 90^\circ
     \]

5. **Verification**:
   - The diagonals of the square are diameters of the circle, and they intersect at the center of the circle, forming right angles (90°).
   - Each side of the square subtends a central angle of \(90^\circ\), which aligns with the symmetry and properties of the inscribed square.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The measure of a central angle subtended by one side of the square is \(90^\circ\).

### Solution Section

Based on the analysis:

- The square \(ABDC\) is inscribed in the circle, and each side of the square subtends a central angle.
- Since the circle is divided into 4 equal parts by the square, the central angle for each side is:
  \[
  \frac{360^\circ}{4} = 90^\circ
  \]

Thus, the measure of a central angle is \(90^\circ\).
