### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the length of segment \( EG \), where \( G \) is the incenter of \( \triangle ABC \). The incenter is the point of intersection of the angle bisectors of a triangle and is equidistant from all three sides of the triangle. The problem provides the following key information:
- \( G \) is the incenter.
- \( \triangle ABC \) has a right angle at \( B \).
- \( BF = 12 \) and \( BG = 13 \).
- \( \angle BFG = 90^\circ \).

We need to use these details to determine the length of \( EG \).

---

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Understand the Geometry of the Problem
- Since \( G \) is the incenter, it lies on the angle bisectors of \( \triangle ABC \).
- The right triangle \( \triangle BFG \) provides a key relationship due to the Pythagorean theorem. We can use this to find the length of \( FG \).

#### Step 2: Use the Pythagorean Theorem in \( \triangle BFG \)
Given:
- \( BF = 12 \)
- \( BG = 13 \)
- \( \angle BFG = 90^\circ \)

Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle BFG \):
\[
BG^2 = BF^2 + FG^2
\]
\[
13^2 = 12^2 + FG^2
\]
\[
169 = 144 + FG^2
\]
\[
FG^2 = 25
\]
\[
FG = 5
\]

So, \( FG = 5 \).

#### Step 3: Analyze the Position of \( E \)
- Point \( E \) is the point where the angle bisector of \( \angle ABG \) intersects \( AB \).
- Since \( G \) is the incenter, \( EG \) is part of the angle bisector of \( \angle ABG \).

#### Step 4: Use the Angle Bisector Theorem
The Angle Bisector Theorem states that the angle bisector of an angle in a triangle divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. However, in this case, we do not have enough information about the sides \( AB \) and \( BC \) to directly apply this theorem.

#### Step 5: Use the Properties of the Incenter
The incenter \( G \) is equidistant from all three sides of the triangle. However, to find \( EG \), we need to consider the specific configuration of the triangle and the given lengths.

#### Step 6: Use the Given Lengths and Relationships
From the right triangle \( \triangle BFG \), we know:
- \( BF = 12 \)
- \( FG = 5 \)
- \( BG = 13 \)

Since \( G \) is the incenter, \( EG \) is a segment within the triangle, and its length can be determined by considering the geometry of the triangle and the given measurements.

#### Step 7: Determine \( EG \)
Given the symmetry and the fact that \( G \) is the incenter, the length \( EG \) is simply the remaining segment of \( FG \) after accounting for the right triangle configuration. Since \( FG = 5 \) and there are no additional segments to subtract, \( EG = 5 \).

---

### Solution Section:

From the analysis above, we have determined that:
- \( FG = 5 \)
- \( EG \) is part of the segment \( FG \) and, given the configuration, \( EG = 5 \).

Thus, the length of \( EG \) is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]

Comparing this with the given answer choices:
A. 4
B. 5
C. 12
D. 13

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]

Final Answer: B
