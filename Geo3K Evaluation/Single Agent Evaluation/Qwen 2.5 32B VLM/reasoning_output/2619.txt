### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the length of diagonal \( EG \) in the rectangle \( EFGH \). The given information is:
- \( FK = 32 \) feet.
- Quadrilateral \( EFGH \) is a rectangle.
- Diagonal \( EG \) intersects diagonal \( FH \) at point \( K \).

Key properties of rectangles:
1. Opposite sides are equal.
2. All interior angles are right angles.
3. Diagonals are equal in length and bisect each other.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**
- Since \( EFGH \) is a rectangle, its diagonals \( EG \) and \( FH \) are equal in length: \( EG = FH \).
- The diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other, meaning they intersect at their midpoints. Therefore, point \( K \) is the midpoint of both \( EG \) and \( FH \).

#### **Step 2: Use the Given Information**
- We are given \( FK = 32 \) feet.
- Since \( K \) is the midpoint of \( FH \), \( FK \) is half the length of \( FH \). Therefore:
  \[
  FH = 2 \times FK = 2 \times 32 = 64 \text{ feet}.
  \]

#### **Step 3: Relate \( FH \) to \( EG \)**
- In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal in length. Thus:
  \[
  EG = FH.
  \]
- From the previous step, we know \( FH = 64 \) feet. Therefore:
  \[
  EG = 64 \text{ feet}.
  \]

#### **Step 4: Verify the Answer**
- The length of \( EG \) is directly determined by the equality of the diagonals in a rectangle.
- The calculation is consistent with the properties of rectangles and the given information.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
