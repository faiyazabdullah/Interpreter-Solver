### Problem Analysis:
The problem provides the measures of two angles, \( \angle 9 \) and \( \angle 10 \), in terms of a variable \( x \):
- \( m\angle 9 = 2x - 4 \)
- \( m\angle 10 = 2x + 4 \)

The goal is to find the measure of \( \angle 10 \). To do this, we need to determine the value of \( x \) first. However, the problem does not explicitly provide a direct relationship between \( \angle 9 \) and \( \angle 10 \). We must rely on the information given and any implicit geometric relationships in the figure.

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify Key Information:**
   - The measures of \( \angle 9 \) and \( \angle 10 \) are expressed in terms of \( x \).
   - No additional relationships (such as supplementary, complementary, or congruent angles) are explicitly stated in the problem text.

2. **Assess the Geometric Figure:**
   - The figure shows two intersecting lines: one horizontal (through points \( B, C, A \)) and one vertical (through points \( E, C, D \)).
   - The angles \( \angle 9 \) and \( \angle 10 \) are adjacent angles formed by these intersecting lines.
   - Adjacent angles on a straight line are supplementary, meaning their measures add up to \( 180^\circ \).

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Since \( \angle 9 \) and \( \angle 10 \) are supplementary:
     \[
     m\angle 9 + m\angle 10 = 180^\circ
     \]
   - Substitute the given expressions for \( m\angle 9 \) and \( m\angle 10 \):
     \[
     (2x - 4) + (2x + 4) = 180
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     2x - 4 + 2x + 4 = 180
     \]
     \[
     4x = 180
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{180}{4} = 45
     \]

5. **Find \( m\angle 10 \):**
   - Substitute \( x = 45 \) into the expression for \( m\angle 10 \):
     \[
     m\angle 10 = 2x + 4
     \]
     \[
     m\angle 10 = 2(45) + 4
     \]
     \[
     m\angle 10 = 90 + 4 = 94
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the measure of \( \angle 9 \):
     \[
     m\angle 9 = 2x - 4 = 2(45) - 4 = 90 - 4 = 86
     \]
   - Verify the supplementary condition:
     \[
     m\angle 9 + m\angle 10 = 86 + 94 = 180
     \]
   - The solution satisfies the supplementary condition.

### Final Answer:
The measure of \( \angle 10 \) is \( 94 \).
