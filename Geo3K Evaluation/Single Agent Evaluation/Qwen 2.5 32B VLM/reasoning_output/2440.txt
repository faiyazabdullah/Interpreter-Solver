### Problem Analysis:
We are given two polygons, $ABCD$ and $AEFG$, which are similar ($ABCD \sim AEFG$). We need to find the measure of $\angle ADC$. Here's the breakdown of the given information:

- $m\angle AGF = 108^\circ$
- $GF = 14$
- $AD = 12$
- $DG = 4.5$
- $EF = 8$
- $AB = 26$

Since the polygons are similar, corresponding angles are equal, and corresponding sides are proportional. We will use these properties to solve the problem.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Similarity**
Since $ABCD \sim AEFG$, the corresponding angles are equal:
- $\angle A = \angle A$ (common angle)
- $\angle B = \angle E$
- $\angle C = \angle F$
- $\angle D = \angle G$

Also, the corresponding sides are proportional:
\[
\frac{AB}{AE} = \frac{BC}{EF} = \frac{CD}{FG} = \frac{DA}{GA}
\]

#### **Step 2: Use the Given Angles**
We are given $m\angle AGF = 108^\circ$. Since $\angle D$ corresponds to $\angle G$ in the similar polygons, we have:
\[
m\angle ADC = m\angle AGF = 108^\circ
\]

#### **Step 3: Verify Proportional Sides**
Although the problem does not explicitly ask us to verify the side proportions, we can use them to ensure consistency. However, the key to solving this problem is the angle relationship due to similarity.

#### **Step 4: Conclusion**
From the similarity of the polygons, we directly conclude that:
\[
m\angle ADC = m\angle AGF = 108^\circ
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
