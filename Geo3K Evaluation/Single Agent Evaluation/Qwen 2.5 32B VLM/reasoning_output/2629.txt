### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the measure of \( \angle 6 \) given that \( \angle 9 = 75^\circ \). The figure shows several intersecting lines and triangles, which suggests we need to use properties of angles formed by parallel lines and transversals, as well as the sum of angles in a triangle.

#### Key Observations from the Image:
1. **Parallel Lines**: The lines \( \ell \), \( m \), and \( n \) appear to be parallel (indicated by the pink arrowheads).
2. **Transversal Lines**: The lines \( t \) and the vertical lines through points \( B \), \( P \), and \( J \) act as transversals.
3. **Given Angle**: \( \angle 9 = 75^\circ \).
4. **Relationships**: We need to use angle relationships such as corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and the sum of angles in a triangle.

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Identify Relationships Between Angles
- Since \( \ell \parallel m \parallel n \) and \( t \) is a transversal, the angles formed have specific relationships:
  - Corresponding angles are equal.
  - Alternate interior angles are equal.
  - Consecutive interior angles are supplementary (sum to \( 180^\circ \)).

#### Step 2: Use Given Information
- \( \angle 9 = 75^\circ \). This angle is part of the triangle containing \( \angle 6 \).

#### Step 3: Analyze the Triangle Containing \( \angle 6 \)
- The triangle containing \( \angle 6 \) has vertices at points \( B \), \( P \), and the intersection of line \( t \) with line \( m \).
- The angles in this triangle are \( \angle 6 \), \( \angle 5 \), and \( \angle 10 \).

#### Step 4: Use Parallel Line Properties
- Since \( m \parallel n \) and \( t \) is a transversal, \( \angle 9 \) and \( \angle 10 \) are corresponding angles. Therefore:
  \[
  \angle 10 = \angle 9 = 75^\circ
  \]

#### Step 5: Sum of Angles in a Triangle
- The sum of the interior angles in any triangle is \( 180^\circ \). For the triangle containing \( \angle 6 \), \( \angle 5 \), and \( \angle 10 \):
  \[
  \angle 6 + \angle 5 + \angle 10 = 180^\circ
  \]
- From the figure, \( \angle 5 \) is a right angle (90Â°) because it is marked with a square symbol. Thus:
  \[
  \angle 6 + 90^\circ + 75^\circ = 180^\circ
  \]

#### Step 6: Solve for \( \angle 6 \)
- Simplify the equation:
  \[
  \angle 6 + 165^\circ = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  \angle 6 = 180^\circ - 165^\circ
  \]
  \[
  \angle 6 = 15^\circ
  \]

#### Step 7: Reassess and Verify
- Upon re-examining the problem, it appears there was a misinterpretation. The correct approach should consider the relationship between \( \angle 9 \) and \( \angle 6 \) through the parallel lines and transversals.
- Correctly, \( \angle 6 \) and \( \angle 9 \) are supplementary because they are consecutive interior angles between the parallel lines \( \ell \) and \( m \) with transversal \( t \):
  \[
  \angle 6 + \angle 9 = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  \angle 6 + 75^\circ = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  \angle 6 = 180^\circ - 75^\circ
  \]
  \[
  \angle 6 = 105^\circ
  \]

### Solution Section:

After correctly applying the properties of parallel lines and transversals, we find:
\[
\angle 6 = 105^\circ
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
