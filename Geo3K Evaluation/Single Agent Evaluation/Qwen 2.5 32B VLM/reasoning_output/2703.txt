### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
The image shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with the following details:
- \( AB = 14 \)
- \( AC = 10 \)
- \( BC = 18 \)
- Point \( D \) lies on \( BC \), dividing it into segments \( BD \) and \( DC \).
- The goal is to find the length of \( BD \), denoted as \( x \).

#### Step 2: Identify Geometric Relationships
The key observation here is that \( AD \) appears to be an **altitude** (perpendicular line from vertex \( A \) to side \( BC \)). However, the problem does not explicitly state this, so we need to consider whether this is a valid assumption or if there is another relationship at play.

Given the context, we can use the **Angle Bisector Theorem** if \( AD \) is an angle bisector, or the **Similarity of Triangles** if \( \triangle ABD \sim \triangle ACD \). Since no specific angle bisector or similarity is mentioned, we will explore the possibility of using the **Stewart's Theorem** for solving this problem.

#### Step 3: Apply Stewart's Theorem
Stewart's Theorem states that in a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with a cevian \( AD \) dividing \( BC \) into segments \( BD = m \) and \( DC = n \):
\[
AB^2 \cdot n + AC^2 \cdot m = AD^2 \cdot BC + m \cdot n \cdot BC
\]
Here:
- \( AB = 14 \)
- \( AC = 10 \)
- \( BC = 18 \)
- \( BD = x \)
- \( DC = 18 - x \)

Substituting these values into Stewart's Theorem:
\[
14^2 \cdot (18 - x) + 10^2 \cdot x = AD^2 \cdot 18 + x \cdot (18 - x) \cdot 18
\]

#### Step 4: Simplify the Equation
First, calculate the squared terms:
\[
14^2 = 196, \quad 10^2 = 100
\]
Substitute these into the equation:
\[
196 \cdot (18 - x) + 100 \cdot x = AD^2 \cdot 18 + x \cdot (18 - x) \cdot 18
\]

Expand and simplify:
\[
196 \cdot 18 - 196x + 100x = AD^2 \cdot 18 + 18x(18 - x)
\]
\[
3528 - 96x = AD^2 \cdot 18 + 18x(18 - x)
\]
\[
3528 - 96x = AD^2 \cdot 18 + 324x - 18x^2
\]

#### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)
To proceed, we need additional information about \( AD \). However, since the problem does not provide \( AD \), we can assume that the problem is designed to be solvable without it. Let's re-evaluate the problem using a simpler approach.

#### Step 6: Re-evaluate Using Proportionality
If \( AD \) is an altitude, then \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle ACD \) are similar by AA similarity (both share \( \angle A \) and have right angles at \( D \)). However, without explicit confirmation, we can use the **Segment Division Property** or **Mass Points** to find \( x \).

Using the segment division property:
\[
\frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{14}{10} = \frac{7}{5}
\]
Let \( BD = 7k \) and \( DC = 5k \). Since \( BD + DC = BC \):
\[
7k + 5k = 18 \implies 12k = 18 \implies k = \frac{18}{12} = 1.5
\]
Thus:
\[
BD = 7k = 7 \cdot 1.5 = 10.5
\]

### Solution Section

Based on the segment division property:
\[
x = BD = 10.5
\]

Final Answer: \boxed{A}
