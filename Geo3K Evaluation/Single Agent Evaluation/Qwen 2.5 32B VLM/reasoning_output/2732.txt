### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
- The problem states that a square is inscribed in a circle.
- The radius of the circle is given as 6 inches.
- We need to find the length of the side of the square.

#### Step 2: Understand the Geometric Relationships
- When a square is inscribed in a circle, the diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle.
- The diameter of the circle is twice the radius, so:
  \[
  \text{Diameter} = 2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ inches}
  \]
- Let the side length of the square be \( s \). The relationship between the side length \( s \) and the diagonal \( d \) of the square is given by the Pythagorean theorem:
  \[
  d = s\sqrt{2}
  \]
- Since the diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle, we have:
  \[
  d = 12 \text{ inches}
  \]

#### Step 3: Set Up the Equation
- Using the relationship \( d = s\sqrt{2} \) and substituting \( d = 12 \):
  \[
  s\sqrt{2} = 12
  \]

#### Step 4: Solve for \( s \)
- To isolate \( s \), divide both sides of the equation by \( \sqrt{2} \):
  \[
  s = \frac{12}{\sqrt{2}}
  \]
- Rationalize the denominator:
  \[
  s = \frac{12}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{12\sqrt{2}}{2} = 6\sqrt{2}
  \]

#### Step 5: Verify the Calculation
- The side length \( s = 6\sqrt{2} \) satisfies the relationship \( d = s\sqrt{2} \):
  \[
  d = (6\sqrt{2})\sqrt{2} = 6 \cdot 2 = 12 \text{ inches}
  \]
- This matches the diameter of the circle, confirming the correctness of the calculation.

#### Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices
- The calculated side length is \( 6\sqrt{2} \).
- The answer choices are:
  A. \( \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \)
  B. \( 3\sqrt{2} \)
  C. \( 6\sqrt{2} \)
  D. \( 12\sqrt{2} \)
- The correct answer matches option C.

### Solution Section:

The side length of the square is \( 6\sqrt{2} \).

Final Answer: **C**
