### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the side length of a square inscribed in a circle, given that the area of the circle is \( 18\pi \) square units. Let's break this problem down step by step.

#### Step 1: Understand the given information
- The area of the circle is \( 18\pi \).
- A square is inscribed in the circle, meaning the diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle.

#### Step 2: Recall relevant formulas
1. **Area of a circle**: \( A = \pi r^2 \), where \( r \) is the radius of the circle.
2. **Diameter of a circle**: \( d = 2r \).
3. **Diagonal of a square**: If the side length of the square is \( s \), then the diagonal \( d \) is given by \( d = s\sqrt{2} \).

#### Step 3: Calculate the radius of the circle
The area of the circle is given as \( 18\pi \). Using the formula for the area of a circle:
\[
\pi r^2 = 18\pi
\]
Divide both sides by \( \pi \):
\[
r^2 = 18
\]
Take the square root of both sides:
\[
r = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}
\]

#### Step 4: Calculate the diameter of the circle
The diameter \( d \) is twice the radius:
\[
d = 2r = 2 \times 3\sqrt{2} = 6\sqrt{2}
\]

#### Step 5: Relate the diameter of the circle to the diagonal of the square
Since the square is inscribed in the circle, the diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle:
\[
\text{Diagonal of the square} = 6\sqrt{2}
\]

#### Step 6: Use the relationship between the side length and the diagonal of the square
The diagonal of a square with side length \( s \) is given by:
\[
d = s\sqrt{2}
\]
Set the diagonal equal to the diameter of the circle:
\[
s\sqrt{2} = 6\sqrt{2}
\]
Divide both sides by \( \sqrt{2} \):
\[
s = 6
\]

#### Step 7: Verify the solution
- The side length of the square is \( s = 6 \).
- The diagonal of the square is \( s\sqrt{2} = 6\sqrt{2} \), which matches the diameter of the circle.
- The radius of the circle is \( 3\sqrt{2} \), and the area of the circle is \( \pi (3\sqrt{2})^2 = 18\pi \), which is consistent with the given information.

### Final Answer:
The length of a side of the square is \( 6 \).

\[
\boxed{C}
\]
