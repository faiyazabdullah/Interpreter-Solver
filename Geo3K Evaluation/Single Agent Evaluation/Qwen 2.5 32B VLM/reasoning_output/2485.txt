### Problem Analysis:
We are given a rhombus \(ABCD\) with the following information:
- \(AB = 2x + 3\)
- \(BC = 5x\)

We need to find the measure of \(\angle AEB\), where \(E\) is the intersection point of the diagonals of the rhombus.

#### Key Properties of a Rhombus:
1. All sides are equal in length.
2. Diagonals bisect each other at right angles (i.e., they are perpendicular).
3. Diagonals bisect the angles of the rhombus.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Use the property of equal side lengths in a rhombus.
Since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, all sides are equal. Therefore:
\[
AB = BC
\]
Substitute the given expressions for \(AB\) and \(BC\):
\[
2x + 3 = 5x
\]

#### Step 2: Solve for \(x\).
Rearrange the equation:
\[
2x + 3 = 5x
\]
\[
3 = 5x - 2x
\]
\[
3 = 3x
\]
\[
x = 1
\]

#### Step 3: Verify the side lengths.
Substitute \(x = 1\) back into the expressions for \(AB\) and \(BC\):
\[
AB = 2(1) + 3 = 5
\]
\[
BC = 5(1) = 5
\]
Since \(AB = BC = 5\), the side lengths are consistent with the properties of a rhombus.

#### Step 4: Use the property of diagonals in a rhombus.
The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. This means that the angle formed by the diagonals at their intersection is \(90^\circ\).

#### Step 5: Identify \(\angle AEB\).
Since \(E\) is the intersection point of the diagonals, \(\angle AEB\) is one of the angles formed by the diagonals. By the property of rhombuses, the diagonals are perpendicular to each other. Therefore:
\[
\angle AEB = 90^\circ
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
