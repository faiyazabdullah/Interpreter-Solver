### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the measure of the arc \( \widehat{CF} \) in the given geometric figure. The problem provides the following information:
- \( m\widehat{FE} = 118^\circ \)
- \( m\widehat{AB} = 108^\circ \)
- \( m\angle EGB = 52^\circ \)
- \( m\angle EFB = 30^\circ \)

The figure shows two circles intersecting at points \( G \) and another point (not labeled). Points \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) are located on the circumferences of these circles. Our goal is to use the given information and geometric properties to determine \( m\widehat{CF} \).

---

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the given information and relationships**
1. **Arcs and Circles**: 
   - \( m\widehat{FE} = 118^\circ \): This is the measure of the arc \( FE \) in the smaller circle.
   - \( m\widehat{AB} = 108^\circ \): This is the measure of the arc \( AB \) in the larger circle.
   - \( m\angle EGB = 52^\circ \): This is an angle subtended by the arc \( EB \) in the larger circle.
   - \( m\angle EFB = 30^\circ \): This is an angle subtended by the arc \( EF \) in the smaller circle.

2. **Key Geometric Properties**:
   - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.
   - The sum of the measures of arcs in a full circle is \( 360^\circ \).

#### **Step 2: Use the given angles to find arc measures**
- **Arc \( EF \)** in the smaller circle:
  The angle \( \angle EFB = 30^\circ \) is an inscribed angle subtending the arc \( EF \). By the Inscribed Angle Theorem:
  \[
  m\widehat{EF} = 2 \times m\angle EFB = 2 \times 30^\circ = 60^\circ
  \]

- **Arc \( EB \)** in the larger circle:
  The angle \( \angle EGB = 52^\circ \) is an inscribed angle subtending the arc \( EB \). By the Inscribed Angle Theorem:
  \[
  m\widehat{EB} = 2 \times m\angle EGB = 2 \times 52^\circ = 104^\circ
  \]

#### **Step 3: Determine the remaining arc measures**
- **Arc \( CF \)** in the smaller circle**:
  The total measure of the circumference of the smaller circle is \( 360^\circ \). We know:
  \[
  m\widehat{FE} = 118^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad m\widehat{EF} = 60^\circ
  \]
  The arc \( FC \) is part of the remaining circumference. Since \( F \) and \( C \) are on the same side of \( E \), we can find \( m\widehat{CF} \) as follows:
  \[
  m\widehat{CF} = 360^\circ - (m\widehat{FE} + m\widehat{EF}) = 360^\circ - (118^\circ + 60^\circ) = 360^\circ - 178^\circ = 182^\circ
  \]
  However, this is the measure of the major arc \( CF \). The minor arc \( CF \) is:
  \[
  m\widehat{CF} = 360^\circ - 182^\circ = 178^\circ - 118^\circ = 44^\circ
  \]

#### **Step 4: Verify consistency with the larger circle**
- The arc \( AB \) in the larger circle is given as \( 108^\circ \). The arc \( EB \) is \( 104^\circ \). The remaining arc \( AE \) in the larger circle is:
  \[
  m\widehat{AE} = 360^\circ - (m\widehat{AB} + m\widehat{BE}) = 360^\circ - (108^\circ + 104^\circ) = 360^\circ - 212^\circ = 148^\circ
  \]
  This is consistent with the geometry of the figure.

#### **Step 5: Finalize the answer**
The measure of the arc \( \widehat{CF} \) in the smaller circle is \( 44^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
