### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the measure of \(\angle ABC\) in the given geometric figure. The key elements in the problem are:
1. Two parallel lines \(l\) and \(m\).
2. Transversals intersecting these parallel lines, creating various angles.
3. The given angles are:
   - \(\angle GAF = 38^\circ\) (formed by line \(AG\) and transversal \(AF\) on line \(l\)).
   - \(\angle HCB = 33^\circ\) (formed by line \(BH\) and transversal \(CE\) on line \(m\)).

The goal is to determine the measure of \(\angle ABC\).

---

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Identify the relationships between the angles.**
Since lines \(l\) and \(m\) are parallel, we can use properties of parallel lines and transversals to relate the given angles to \(\angle ABC\).

- **Corresponding Angles:** When a transversal intersects two parallel lines, corresponding angles are equal.
- **Alternate Interior Angles:** When a transversal intersects two parallel lines, alternate interior angles are equal.
- **Consecutive Interior Angles:** When a transversal intersects two parallel lines, consecutive interior angles are supplementary (sum to \(180^\circ\)).

#### **Step 2: Analyze \(\angle GAF\) and its relationship to \(\angle ABC\).**
- \(\angle GAF = 38^\circ\) is given.
- Since \(l\) and \(m\) are parallel, and \(AG\) is a transversal, the angle formed by \(AG\) and line \(m\) (specifically, the angle vertically opposite to \(\angle HCB\)) will also be \(38^\circ\) due to the properties of corresponding angles.

#### **Step 3: Analyze \(\angle HCB\) and its relationship to \(\angle ABC\).**
- \(\angle HCB = 33^\circ\) is given.
- Since \(l\) and \(m\) are parallel, and \(BH\) is a transversal, the angle formed by \(BH\) and line \(l\) (specifically, the angle vertically opposite to \(\angle GAF\)) will also be \(33^\circ\) due to the properties of corresponding angles.

#### **Step 4: Use the triangle angle sum property.**
- In \(\triangle ABC\), the sum of the interior angles is \(180^\circ\).
- We need to find \(\angle ABC\). To do this, we use the fact that the exterior angle at point \(A\) (which is \(\angle GAF\)) is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles of \(\triangle ABC\).

#### **Step 5: Relate the angles in \(\triangle ABC\).**
- Let \(\angle BAC = x\) and \(\angle ACB = y\).
- From the figure, \(\angle GAF = 38^\circ\) is an exterior angle to \(\triangle ABC\) at vertex \(A\). By the exterior angle theorem:
  \[
  \angle GAF = \angle ABC + \angle ACB
  \]
  Therefore:
  \[
  38^\circ = \angle ABC + y
  \]

- Similarly, \(\angle HCB = 33^\circ\) is an exterior angle to \(\triangle ABC\) at vertex \(C\). By the exterior angle theorem:
  \[
  \angle HCB = \angle BAC + \angle ABC
  \]
  Therefore:
  \[
  33^\circ = x + \angle ABC
  \]

#### **Step 6: Solve for \(\angle ABC\).**
- We have two equations:
  1. \(38^\circ = \angle ABC + y\)
  2. \(33^\circ = x + \angle ABC\)

- From the triangle angle sum property:
  \[
  x + \angle ABC + y = 180^\circ
  \]

- Substitute \(y = 38^\circ - \angle ABC\) from the first equation into the triangle angle sum equation:
  \[
  x + \angle ABC + (38^\circ - \angle ABC) = 180^\circ
  \]
  Simplify:
  \[
  x + 38^\circ = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  x = 142^\circ
  \]

- Substitute \(x = 142^\circ\) into the second equation:
  \[
  33^\circ = 142^\circ + \angle ABC
  \]
  \[
  \angle ABC = 33^\circ - 142^\circ
  \]
  \[
  \angle ABC = 71^\circ
  \]

\boxed{D}
