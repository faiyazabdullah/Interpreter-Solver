### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the measure of angle \( \angle ACD \) in the parallelogram \( ABCD \). The given information includes:
- \( \angle DAB = 59^\circ \)
- \( \angle ABC = 20^\circ \)
- \( \angle AFB = 49^\circ \)

Key properties of a parallelogram that will be useful:
1. Opposite angles are equal.
2. Consecutive angles are supplementary (sum to \( 180^\circ \)).
3. Diagonals bisect each other.

### Thought Section:
#### Step 1: Identify Known Angles and Relationships
- Since \( ABCD \) is a parallelogram, we know:
  - \( \angle DAB = \angle BCD = 59^\circ \) (opposite angles are equal).
  - \( \angle ABC = \angle CDA = 20^\circ \) (opposite angles are equal).

#### Step 2: Use Supplementary Angles
- In a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. Therefore:
  - \( \angle DAB + \angle ABC = 180^\circ \)
  - \( \angle ABC + \angle BCD = 180^\circ \)
  - \( \angle BCD + \angle CDA = 180^\circ \)
  - \( \angle CDA + \angle DAB = 180^\circ \)

#### Step 3: Analyze Triangle \( ABF \)
- In triangle \( ABF \), we know:
  - \( \angle DAB = 59^\circ \)
  - \( \angle AFB = 49^\circ \)
- Using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \):
  \[
  \angle ABF = 180^\circ - \angle DAB - \angle AFB = 180^\circ - 59^\circ - 49^\circ = 72^\circ
  \]

#### Step 4: Use Parallelogram Properties to Find \( \angle ACD \)
- Since \( \angle BCD = 59^\circ \) (opposite angle to \( \angle DAB \)), and \( \angle ACD \) is part of the same side as \( \angle BCD \), we need to consider the internal angle relationships.
- Notice that \( \angle ACD \) is part of the larger angle \( \angle BCD \), and since \( \angle AFB = 49^\circ \) is an external angle formed by the intersection of diagonals, it does not directly affect the measure of \( \angle ACD \).

#### Step 5: Confirm \( \angle ACD \)
- Since \( \angle BCD = 59^\circ \) and there are no additional angles subtracted or added within \( \angle ACD \) based on the given information, \( \angle ACD = 59^\circ \).

### Solution Section:
Based on the properties of the parallelogram and the given angles:
- \( \angle BCD = 59^\circ \)
- Therefore, \( \angle ACD = 59^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
