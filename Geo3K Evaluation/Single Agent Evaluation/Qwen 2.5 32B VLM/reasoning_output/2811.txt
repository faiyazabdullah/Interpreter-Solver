### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with the following details:
- \( \angle C \) is a right angle (indicated by the pink square).
- The hypotenuse \( AB \) has a length of \( x \).
- One leg \( AC \) has a length of 16.
- The other leg \( BC \) has a length of 10.

#### Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found
We need to find the value of \( x \), which is the length of the hypotenuse \( AB \).

#### Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems
The most relevant theorem here is the **Pythagorean Theorem**, which states:
\[
AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2
\]
where \( AB \) is the hypotenuse, and \( AC \) and \( BC \) are the legs of the right triangle.

#### Step 4: Substitute the Given Values
From the image:
- \( AC = 16 \)
- \( BC = 10 \)
- \( AB = x \)

Substitute these values into the Pythagorean Theorem:
\[
x^2 = 16^2 + 10^2
\]

#### Step 5: Perform the Calculations
Calculate each term:
\[
16^2 = 256
\]
\[
10^2 = 100
\]
\[
x^2 = 256 + 100 = 356
\]

To find \( x \), take the square root of both sides:
\[
x = \sqrt{356}
\]

#### Step 6: Simplify the Square Root
Simplify \( \sqrt{356} \):
\[
356 = 4 \times 89
\]
\[
\sqrt{356} = \sqrt{4 \times 89} = \sqrt{4} \cdot \sqrt{89} = 2\sqrt{89}
\]

Since \( \sqrt{89} \approx 9.43 \):
\[
x \approx 2 \times 9.43 = 18.86
\]

However, this approach seems to have led to an incorrect interpretation. Let's recheck the direct calculation:
\[
x = \sqrt{356} \approx 18.86
\]

#### Step 7: Reassess and Verify
Upon rechecking, it appears there might be a misunderstanding. Let's directly compute \( \sqrt{356} \) more precisely:
\[
\sqrt{356} \approx 18.86
\]

This does not match any of the provided options. Let's re-evaluate the problem setup and ensure no misinterpretation occurred.

#### Step 8: Reflect on the Problem
Given the options (A: 21, B: 34, C: 58, D: 67), it seems there might be a different interpretation or a typo in the problem. However, based on the Pythagorean Theorem, the correct value of \( x \) is approximately 18.86, which does not match any of the provided choices.

#### Step 9: Select the Closest Option
Since none of the options match the calculated value, we must select the closest option. The closest value to 18.86 among the choices is 21.

### Solution Section:

Based on the detailed analysis and calculations, the closest value to the calculated hypotenuse \( x \approx 18.86 \) is 21.
