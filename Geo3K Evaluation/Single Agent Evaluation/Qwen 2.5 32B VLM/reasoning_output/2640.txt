### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Analyze the given information
- The image shows a circle with several points and lines.
- There are tangent segments labeled at points $ A $ and $ D $, indicating that $ AB $ and $ CD $ are tangents to the circle.
- The angle subtended by the arc $ \widehat{CD} $ at the circumference is given as $ 30^\circ $.
- The angle $ \angle CAD $ is labeled as $ 3x^\circ $.
- The angle subtended by the arc $ \widehat{AB} $ at the circumference is labeled as $ (4x + 50)^\circ $.

#### Step 2: Use geometric properties
1. **Tangent-Secant Theorem**: If a tangent and a secant are drawn from an external point to a circle, the angle between the tangent and the secant is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs.
2. **Inscribed Angle Theorem**: An inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.

#### Step 3: Relate the angles
- The angle $ \angle CAD = 3x^\circ $ is an inscribed angle subtending the arc $ \widehat{CD} $.
- By the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the measure of the arc $ \widehat{CD} $ is twice the measure of the inscribed angle:
  $$
  \text{Measure of } \widehat{CD} = 2 \times 30^\circ = 60^\circ.
  $$

#### Step 4: Use the Tangent-Secant Theorem
- The angle $ \angle BAD $ (formed by the tangent $ AB $ and the secant $ AD $) is given as $ (4x + 50)^\circ $.
- By the Tangent-Secant Theorem, the angle $ \angle BAD $ is half the difference of the intercepted arcs:
  $$
  \angle BAD = \frac{1}{2} (\text{Measure of } \widehat{AD} - \text{Measure of } \widehat{AB}).
  $$
- Since $ \widehat{AD} $ is the entire arc from $ A $ to $ D $ passing through $ C $, we can express it as:
  $$
  \widehat{AD} = \widehat{AC} + \widehat{CD}.
  $$
- The measure of $ \widehat{AC} $ is not directly given, but we know the total measure of the circle is $ 360^\circ $. Therefore, we can use the relationship between the arcs and the given angles.

#### Step 5: Set up equations
- The angle $ \angle CAD = 3x^\circ $ is part of the inscribed angle subtending $ \widehat{CD} $, which is $ 60^\circ $.
- The angle $ \angle BAD = (4x + 50)^\circ $ is related to the difference of the arcs $ \widehat{AD} $ and $ \widehat{AB} $.

#### Step 6: Solve for \( x \)
- From the Inscribed Angle Theorem, we have:
  $$
  3x = 30 \implies x = 10.
  $$
- Verify the consistency with the Tangent-Secant Theorem:
  $$
  \angle BAD = 4x + 50 = 4(10) + 50 = 90^\circ.
  $$
- This is consistent with the geometric relationships in the circle.

### Solution Section:

From the analysis, we find that \( x = 10 \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:

- A. 10
- B. 30
- C. 90
- D. 120

The correct answer is:

$$
\boxed{A}
$$
