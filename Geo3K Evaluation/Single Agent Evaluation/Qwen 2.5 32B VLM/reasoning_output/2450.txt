### Problem Analysis:
The problem describes a triangular path involving three cities: Des Moines (C), Phoenix (B), and Atlanta (A). The distances between these cities are given as algebraic expressions in terms of \( x \):
- Distance from Des Moines (C) to Phoenix (B): \( 110x + 53 \)
- Distance from Des Moines (C) to Atlanta (A): \( 73.8x \)
- Distance from Phoenix (B) to Atlanta (A): \( 150x + 91 \)

The total trip distance, which is the perimeter of the triangle, is given as 3482 miles. We need to find the distance from Phoenix to Atlanta, which is \( 150x + 91 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Write the equation for the total trip distance**
The total trip distance is the sum of the distances along the three sides of the triangle:
\[
(110x + 53) + (73.8x) + (150x + 91) = 3482
\]

#### **Step 2: Simplify the equation**
Combine like terms:
\[
110x + 73.8x + 150x + 53 + 91 = 3482
\]
\[
(110x + 73.8x + 150x) + (53 + 91) = 3482
\]
\[
333.8x + 144 = 3482
\]

#### **Step 3: Solve for \( x \)**
Isolate \( x \) by subtracting 144 from both sides:
\[
333.8x = 3482 - 144
\]
\[
333.8x = 3338
\]
Divide both sides by 333.8:
\[
x = \frac{3338}{333.8}
\]
\[
x = 10
\]

#### **Step 4: Calculate the distance from Phoenix to Atlanta**
The distance from Phoenix to Atlanta is given by the expression \( 150x + 91 \). Substitute \( x = 10 \) into this expression:
\[
150x + 91 = 150(10) + 91
\]
\[
150x + 91 = 1500 + 91
\]
\[
150x + 91 = 1591
\]

#### **Step 5: Verify the total trip distance**
To ensure correctness, substitute \( x = 10 \) into the expressions for the other two sides and calculate the total perimeter:
- Distance from Des Moines to Phoenix: \( 110x + 53 = 110(10) + 53 = 1100 + 53 = 1153 \)
- Distance from Des Moines to Atlanta: \( 73.8x = 73.8(10) = 738 \)
- Distance from Phoenix to Atlanta: \( 150x + 91 = 1591 \) (as calculated)

Total perimeter:
\[
1153 + 738 + 1591 = 3482
\]
The total matches the given perimeter, confirming the solution is correct.

### Final Answer:
The distance from Phoenix to Atlanta is \( 1591 \) miles. Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
