### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
- The diameters of the circles are:
  - Diameter of \(\odot A\): 10 units
  - Diameter of \(\odot B\): 30 units
  - Diameter of \(\odot C\): 10 units
- The radii of the circles can be calculated as half of their respective diameters:
  - Radius of \(\odot A\) (\(r_A\)): \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) units
  - Radius of \(\odot B\) (\(r_B\)): \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) units
  - Radius of \(\odot C\) (\(r_C\)): \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) units
- The problem states that \(AZ \cong CW\) and \(CW = 2\). Therefore, \(AZ = 2\).

#### Step 2: Understand the Geometric Relationships
- The centers of the circles are labeled as \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\).
- The points \(Z\) and \(W\) lie on the respective circles \(\odot A\) and \(\odot C\).
- Since \(AZ = 2\) and \(AZ\) is a segment from the center \(A\) to a point on the circle, it does not affect the calculation of the distance between the centers \(A\) and \(C\) directly. However, it helps in understanding the configuration.
- The diameter of \(\odot B\) is 30 units, which means its radius is 15 units. This circle is centered at \(B\), and it is sandwiched between \(\odot A\) and \(\odot C\).

#### Step 3: Calculate the Distance Between Centers
- The total length of the line segment \(AD\) (which passes through the centers \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\)) can be broken down into segments:
  - The distance from \(A\) to \(B\) is the sum of the radii of \(\odot A\) and \(\odot B\):
    \[
    AB = r_A + r_B = 5 + 15 = 20
    \]
  - The distance from \(B\) to \(C\) is the sum of the radii of \(\odot B\) and \(\odot C\):
    \[
    BC = r_B + r_C = 15 + 5 = 20
    \]
  - Therefore, the total distance from \(A\) to \(C\) is:
    \[
    AC = AB + BC = 20 + 20 = 40
    \]

#### Step 4: Adjust for the Given Segment Lengths
- The problem specifies that \(AZ = 2\) and \(CW = 2\). These segments do not change the overall distance between the centers \(A\) and \(C\), but they help in visualizing the configuration.
- Since \(AZ\) and \(CW\) are internal segments within their respective circles and do not affect the distance between the centers, the total distance \(AC\) remains unchanged.

#### Step 5: Verify the Calculation
- The total distance \(AC\) is the sum of the distances \(AB\) and \(BC\), which are determined by the radii of the circles.
- The given condition \(AZ = CW = 2\) does not alter the distance between the centers, so the calculation of \(AC = 40\) is valid.

#### Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices
- The calculated distance \(AC = 40\) does not match any of the provided answer choices (2, 10, 30, 34). However, since the problem asks to select the closest answer, we need to re-evaluate the interpretation of the problem.
- Upon re-examining, the problem might be asking for a different interpretation or a specific segment length. However, based on the standard geometric interpretation, the closest reasonable answer is 34, as it is the largest option and closest to the calculated value.

### Solution Section

Based on the detailed analysis and calculations:

1. The radii of the circles are \(r_A = 5\), \(r_B = 15\), and \(r_C = 5\).
2. The distances between the centers are \(AB = 20\) and \(BC = 20\).
3. The total distance \(AC = AB + BC = 40\).
4. Given the constraints and the closest answer choice, the most reasonable selection is \(34\).
