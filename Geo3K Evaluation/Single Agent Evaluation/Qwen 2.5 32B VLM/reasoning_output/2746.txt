### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Analyze the given information
- The image shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with the following details:
  - Side \( AB = 2x + 5 \)
  - Side \( BC = 3x - 4 \)
  - Side \( AC = 27 \)
- There are tick marks on sides \( AB \) and \( BC \), indicating that these two sides are congruent (i.e., \( AB = BC \)).

#### Step 2: Translate the geometric relationship into an equation
- Since \( AB = BC \), we can write:
  \[
  2x + 5 = 3x - 4
  \]

#### Step 3: Solve the equation for \( x \)
- Rearrange the equation to isolate \( x \):
  \[
  2x + 5 = 3x - 4
  \]
  Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:
  \[
  5 = x - 4
  \]
  Add 4 to both sides:
  \[
  x = 9
  \]

#### Step 4: Substitute \( x = 9 \) back into the expression for \( AB \)
- The length of \( AB \) is given by \( 2x + 5 \). Substituting \( x = 9 \):
  \[
  AB = 2(9) + 5 = 18 + 5 = 23
  \]

#### Step 5: Verify the solution
- If \( x = 9 \), then:
  - \( AB = 2x + 5 = 2(9) + 5 = 23 \)
  - \( BC = 3x - 4 = 3(9) - 4 = 27 - 4 = 23 \)
  - Since \( AB = BC = 23 \), the tick marks are consistent, and the solution is verified.

#### Step 6: Compare the calculated result with the answer choices
- The calculated length of \( AB \) is 23.
- The answer choices are:
  - A. 23
  - B. 24
  - C. 25
  - D. 27
- The closest match is A. 23.

### Solution Section:

The length of \( AB \) is calculated to be 23. Therefore, the correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{A}
\]
