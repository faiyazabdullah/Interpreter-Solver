### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the measure of $\angle 2$ given that $AB \perp BC$. The image contains several labeled angles and points, and we need to use geometric properties to determine $\angle 2$.

#### Given Information:
1. $AB \perp BC$: This means $\angle ABC = 90^\circ$.
2. Various angles are labeled in the diagram:
   - $\angle 1 = 104^\circ$
   - $\angle DAB = 36^\circ$
   - $\angle FEC = 40^\circ$
   - Other angles are labeled but not directly given (e.g., $\angle 2$, $\angle 3$, etc.).

#### Objective:
Find the measure of $\angle 2$.

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Understand the Perpendicular Condition
Since $AB \perp BC$, we know:
\[
\angle ABC = 90^\circ
\]

#### Step 2: Analyze $\angle 1$ and $\angle DAB$
- $\angle 1 = 104^\circ$ is an exterior angle to $\triangle ABD$ at point $A$.
- $\angle DAB = 36^\circ$ is one of the interior angles of $\triangle ABD$.
- The third angle in $\triangle ABD$ at vertex $B$ can be found using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is $180^\circ$.

#### Step 3: Calculate $\angle 2$
- $\angle 2$ is part of $\triangle ABD$.
- The sum of the interior angles in $\triangle ABD$ is:
  \[
  \angle DAB + \angle 2 + \angle ABD = 180^\circ
  \]
- We know $\angle DAB = 36^\circ$ and $\angle ABD = 90^\circ$ (since $AB \perp BC$).
- Substitute these values:
  \[
  36^\circ + \angle 2 + 90^\circ = 180^\circ
  \]
- Simplify:
  \[
  \angle 2 + 126^\circ = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  \angle 2 = 180^\circ - 126^\circ
  \]
  \[
  \angle 2 = 54^\circ
  \]

#### Step 4: Reassess and Verify
- The calculation seems consistent with the given conditions.
- However, we must ensure that $\angle 1 = 104^\circ$ is correctly interpreted. Since $\angle 1$ is an exterior angle, it equals the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles of $\triangle ABD$:
  \[
  \angle 1 = \angle DAB + \angle 2
  \]
  \[
  104^\circ = 36^\circ + \angle 2
  \]
  \[
  \angle 2 = 104^\circ - 36^\circ
  \]
  \[
  \angle 2 = 68^\circ
  \]

This confirms that $\angle 2 = 68^\circ$.

---

### Solution Section:

After re-evaluating the problem, we find:
\[
\angle 2 = 68^\circ
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
