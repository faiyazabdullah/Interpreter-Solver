### Problem Analysis:
The given image depicts a quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with specific angle measures and right angles. The task is to find the measure of \(\angle C\).

#### **Step 1: Identify Given Information**
1. The quadrilateral \(ABCD\) has four vertices: \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
2. \(\angle B = 90^\circ\) and \(\angle C = 90^\circ\) (indicated by the right-angle symbols).
3. \(\angle A = 3x^\circ\) (labeled in the diagram).
4. \(\angle D = x^\circ\) (labeled in the diagram).

#### **Step 2: Understand the Goal**
We need to find the measure of \(\angle C\). However, since \(\angle C\) is already marked as a right angle (\(90^\circ\)), we need to verify this using the sum of interior angles of a quadrilateral.

#### **Step 3: Apply Geometric Properties**
- The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is always \(360^\circ\).
- Therefore, we can write the equation for the sum of the angles in quadrilateral \(ABCD\):
  \[
  \angle A + \angle B + \angle C + \angle D = 360^\circ
  \]

#### **Step 4: Substitute Known Values**
From the diagram:
- \(\angle A = 3x^\circ\)
- \(\angle B = 90^\circ\)
- \(\angle C = 90^\circ\) (right angle)
- \(\angle D = x^\circ\)

Substitute these values into the equation:
\[
3x + 90 + 90 + x = 360
\]

#### **Step 5: Simplify the Equation**
Combine like terms:
\[
3x + x + 90 + 90 = 360
\]
\[
4x + 180 = 360
\]

Subtract 180 from both sides:
\[
4x = 180
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
x = 45
\]

#### **Step 6: Verify \(\angle C\)** 
From the problem, \(\angle C\) is explicitly marked as a right angle (\(90^\circ\)). The value of \(x\) does not affect \(\angle C\) directly, as it is already given as \(90^\circ\).

### Solution:
The measure of \(\angle C\) is \(90^\circ\).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
