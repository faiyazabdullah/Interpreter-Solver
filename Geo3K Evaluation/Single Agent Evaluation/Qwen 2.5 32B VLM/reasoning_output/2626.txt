### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Analyze the Image
The image shows a parallelogram \(ABCD\) with the following features:
- \(AD = 10 \, \text{m}\) (one side of the parallelogram).
- A perpendicular segment \(BD\) is drawn from vertex \(B\) to side \(AD\), forming a right triangle \(\triangle ABD\).
- The length of the perpendicular segment \(BD = 6 \, \text{m}\).

#### Step 2: Identify Known Information
- The base of the parallelogram is \(AD = 10 \, \text{m}\).
- The height of the parallelogram is the perpendicular distance from \(B\) to \(AD\), which is given as \(BD = 6 \, \text{m}\).

#### Step 3: Recall the Formula for the Area of a Parallelogram
The area \(A\) of a parallelogram is given by:
\[
A = \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
Here, the base is \(AD = 10 \, \text{m}\) and the height is \(BD = 6 \, \text{m}\).

#### Step 4: Calculate the Area
Substitute the known values into the formula:
\[
A = AD \times BD = 10 \, \text{m} \times 6 \, \text{m} = 60 \, \text{m}^2
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the Calculation
- The base \(AD\) is clearly labeled as \(10 \, \text{m}\).
- The height \(BD\) is given as \(6 \, \text{m}\).
- The calculation \(10 \times 6 = 60\) is straightforward and correct.

#### Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated area is \(60 \, \text{m}^2\). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 24
- B. 30
- C. 48
- D. 60

The correct answer matches choice D.

### Solution Section:

The area of the parallelogram \(ABCD\) is calculated as follows:
\[
A = AD \times BD = 10 \, \text{m} \times 6 \, \text{m} = 60 \, \text{m}^2
\]

Final Answer: **D**
