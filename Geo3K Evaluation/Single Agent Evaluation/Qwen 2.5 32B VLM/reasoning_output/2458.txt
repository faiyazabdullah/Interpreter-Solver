### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the measure of \(\angle CFD\) in a circle \(\odot F\) with diameter \(AC\). The given information includes:
- \(\angle BFD = 72^\circ\).
- \(\angle AFD = (2a - 5)^\circ\).
- \(\angle CFD = (4a - 1)^\circ\).

The key geometric property to use here is that the sum of the central angles around point \(F\) (the center of the circle) is \(360^\circ\). Additionally, since \(AC\) is the diameter, \(\angle AFC = 180^\circ\), which will help us verify our solution.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Sum of Central Angles**
The central angles around point \(F\) (the center of the circle) must sum to \(360^\circ\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\angle BFD + \angle AFD + \angle CFD = 360^\circ
\]
Substitute the given expressions for the angles:
\[
72^\circ + (2a - 5)^\circ + (4a - 1)^\circ = 360^\circ
\]

#### **Step 2: Simplify the Equation**
Combine like terms:
\[
72 + 2a - 5 + 4a - 1 = 360
\]
\[
72 - 5 - 1 + 2a + 4a = 360
\]
\[
66 + 6a = 360
\]

#### **Step 3: Solve for \(a\)**
Isolate \(a\):
\[
6a = 360 - 66
\]
\[
6a = 294
\]
\[
a = \frac{294}{6}
\]
\[
a = 49
\]

#### **Step 4: Find \(\angle CFD\)** 
Now that we have \(a = 49\), substitute it back into the expression for \(\angle CFD\):
\[
\angle CFD = (4a - 1)^\circ
\]
\[
\angle CFD = 4(49) - 1
\]
\[
\angle CFD = 196 - 1
\]
\[
\angle CFD = 195^\circ
\]

However, this result does not match any of the given answer choices. Let's re-evaluate the problem to ensure there are no mistakes.

#### **Step 5: Re-evaluate the Problem**
Given that \(AC\) is the diameter, \(\angle AFC = 180^\circ\). This implies that the sum of \(\angle AFD\) and \(\angle CFD\) should be \(180^\circ\):
\[
\angle AFD + \angle CFD = 180^\circ
\]
Substitute the expressions for \(\angle AFD\) and \(\angle CFD\):
\[
(2a - 5) + (4a - 1) = 180
\]
Simplify:
\[
2a + 4a - 5 - 1 = 180
\]
\[
6a - 6 = 180
\]
\[
6a = 186
\]
\[
a = 31
\]

#### **Step 6: Recalculate \(\angle CFD\)**
Using \(a = 31\):
\[
\angle CFD = (4a - 1)^\circ
\]
\[
\angle CFD = 4(31) - 1
\]
\[
\angle CFD = 124 - 1
\]
\[
\angle CFD = 123^\circ
\]

### Final Answer:
The measure of \(\angle CFD\) is \(123^\circ\).

\[
\boxed{D}
\]
