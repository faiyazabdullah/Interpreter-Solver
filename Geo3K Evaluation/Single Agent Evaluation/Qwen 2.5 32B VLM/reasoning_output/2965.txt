### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Image
The image shows a triangle \( \triangle WXY \) with the following features:
- The sides of the triangle are labeled with expressions involving \( x \):
  - Side \( WX \): \( 9x \)
  - Side \( XY \): \( 4x + 5 \)
  - Side \( WY \): \( 6x + 3 \)
- There are tick marks on the sides \( WX \) and \( XY \), indicating that these two sides are congruent (i.e., they have the same length).

#### Step 2: Understand the Geometric Relationships
From the tick marks, we can deduce that:
\[ WX = XY \]
This means:
\[ 9x = 4x + 5 \]

#### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
We need to solve the equation \( 9x = 4x + 5 \):
1. Subtract \( 4x \) from both sides:
   \[
   9x - 4x = 5
   \]
2. Simplify:
   \[
   5x = 5
   \]
3. Divide both sides by 5:
   \[
   x = 1
   \]

#### Step 4: Verify the Solution
Substitute \( x = 1 \) back into the expressions for the sides to ensure consistency:
- \( WX = 9x = 9(1) = 9 \)
- \( XY = 4x + 5 = 4(1) + 5 = 9 \)
- \( WY = 6x + 3 = 6(1) + 3 = 9 \)

The sides \( WX \) and \( XY \) are indeed equal, confirming that our solution is correct.

#### Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated value of \( x \) is \( 1 \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 1
- B. 3
- C. 5
- D. 6

The correct answer matches option A.

### Solution Section

The value of \( x \) is \( 1 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: **A**
