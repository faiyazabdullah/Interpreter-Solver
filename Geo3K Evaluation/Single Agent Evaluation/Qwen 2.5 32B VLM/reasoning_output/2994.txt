### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a geometric figure involving tangents, secants, and a circle. Here are the key observations and given information:

1. **Tangent-Secant Configuration**:
   - Line \( AB \) is a secant to the circle, intersecting the circle at points \( A \) and \( F \).
   - Line \( CH \) appears to be tangent to the circle at point \( H \).
   - Line \( CD \) is a tangent to the circle at point \( D \).

2. **Given Measurements**:
   - \( CB = 39 \)
   - \( BD = y \)
   - \( CA = 5x - 8 \)
   - \( AD = 72 - 3x \)

3. **Geometric Relationships**:
   - Tangent-Secant Theorem: If a tangent and a secant are drawn from an external point to a circle, the square of the length of the tangent segment is equal to the product of the lengths of the secant segment and its external part.
     \[
     CT^2 = CB \cdot CF
     \]
   - Since \( CD \) is tangent and \( CA \) is part of the secant \( AB \), we can use the Tangent-Secant Theorem to relate these segments.

4. **Objective**:
   - Find the value of \( x \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify Tangent and Secant Segments
- \( CD \) is tangent to the circle at \( D \).
- \( CA \) and \( AB \) form the secant line \( AB \).
- According to the Tangent-Secant Theorem:
  \[
  CD^2 = CA \cdot CB
  \]

#### Step 2: Express Lengths in Terms of \( x \)
- \( CA = 5x - 8 \)
- \( CB = 39 \)
- \( AB = CA + AD = (5x - 8) + (72 - 3x) = 2x + 64 \)
- Since \( CD \) is tangent, let \( CD = z \). By the Tangent-Secant Theorem:
  \[
  z^2 = CA \cdot CB
  \]
  Substituting the known values:
  \[
  z^2 = (5x - 8) \cdot 39
  \]

#### Step 3: Use Additional Geometric Relationships
- The total length of the secant \( AB \) is split into \( CA \) and \( AD \):
  \[
  AB = CA + AD = (5x - 8) + (72 - 3x) = 2x + 64
  \]
- However, we need to focus on the relationship between the tangent and the secant. The Tangent-Secant Theorem directly gives us:
  \[
  z^2 = (5x - 8) \cdot 39
  \]

#### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
- We are given that \( z = 41 \) (the length of the tangent segment \( CD \)).
- Substitute \( z = 41 \) into the equation:
  \[
  41^2 = (5x - 8) \cdot 39
  \]
  Simplify:
  \[
  1681 = (5x - 8) \cdot 39
  \]
  Divide both sides by 39:
  \[
  5x - 8 = \frac{1681}{39}
  \]
  Calculate the right-hand side:
  \[
  \frac{1681}{39} \approx 43.1
  \]
  So:
  \[
  5x - 8 = 43.1
  \]
  Add 8 to both sides:
  \[
  5x = 51.1
  \]
  Divide by 5:
  \[
  x = \frac{51.1}{5} = 10.22
  \]

#### Step 5: Round to the Nearest Tenth
- Rounding \( x = 10.22 \) to the nearest tenth gives \( x = 10.2 \).

#### Step 6: Match with Answer Choices
- The closest answer choice to \( x = 10.2 \) is \( 10 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
