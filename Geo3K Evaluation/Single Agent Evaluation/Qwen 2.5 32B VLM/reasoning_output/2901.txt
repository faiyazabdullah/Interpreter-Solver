### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a triangle \( \triangle WXY \) with a perpendicular line segment \( WX \) dividing it into two smaller triangles, \( \triangle WXY \) and \( \triangle WXZ \). The problem states that \( \triangle WXY \cong \triangle WXZ \), meaning these two triangles are congruent. This implies that corresponding sides and angles of the two triangles are equal.

From the image:
- \( WX \) is perpendicular to \( YZ \), making \( \angle WXY = \angle WXZ = 90^\circ \).
- The angle at \( W \) is given as \( (20y + 10)^\circ \).
- The base \( YZ \) is divided into two segments: \( XY = 19 \) and \( XZ = 3y + 7 \).

We need to find the value of \( y \).

### Thought Section:
1. **Congruence Implication**:
   Since \( \triangle WXY \cong \triangle WXZ \), the corresponding sides and angles of these triangles are equal. This means:
   - \( WX \) is common to both triangles.
   - \( XY = XZ \) because the triangles are congruent.
   - Therefore, \( XY = XZ \Rightarrow 19 = 3y + 7 \).

2. **Solve for \( y \)**:
   From the equation \( 19 = 3y + 7 \):
   - Subtract 7 from both sides: \( 19 - 7 = 3y \).
   - Simplify: \( 12 = 3y \).
   - Divide by 3: \( y = 4 \).

3. **Verify the Angle**:
   The angle at \( W \) is given as \( (20y + 10)^\circ \). Substituting \( y = 4 \):
   - \( 20y + 10 = 20(4) + 10 = 80 + 10 = 90^\circ \).
   - This is consistent with the fact that \( WX \) is perpendicular to \( YZ \), so \( \angle WXY = \angle WXZ = 90^\circ \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   The value of \( y \) satisfies both the congruence condition and the geometric properties of the triangle. Therefore, \( y = 4 \).

### Solution Section:
From the analysis:
1. The congruence of \( \triangle WXY \) and \( \triangle WXZ \) implies \( XY = XZ \).
2. Setting up the equation \( 19 = 3y + 7 \) and solving for \( y \) gives \( y = 4 \).
3. Verifying the angle at \( W \) confirms the solution is consistent with the geometric properties.

Thus, the value of \( y \) is \( 4 \).
