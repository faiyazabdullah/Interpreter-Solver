### Problem Analysis:
We are given an equilateral triangle \( \triangle LMN \) with the following information:
- \( MP \) bisects the side \( LN \).
- The sides of the triangle are expressed in terms of variables:
  - \( LM = 3x + 1 \)
  - \( MN = 4x - 2 \)
- The angle at \( M \) is labeled as \( 5y^\circ \).

Since \( \triangle LMN \) is equilateral, all its sides are equal, and each internal angle is \( 60^\circ \). Therefore:
1. \( LM = MN = LN \).
2. The angle at \( M \) is \( 60^\circ \), so \( 5y = 60 \).

Our goal is to find the measure of the side of \( \triangle LMN \).

---

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Use the property of equilateral triangles**
Since \( \triangle LMN \) is equilateral, all sides are equal:
\[ LM = MN = LN. \]

From the given expressions for the sides:
\[ LM = 3x + 1 \]
\[ MN = 4x - 2 \]

Equating \( LM \) and \( MN \):
\[ 3x + 1 = 4x - 2 \]

#### **Step 2: Solve for \( x \)**
Rearrange the equation:
\[ 3x + 1 = 4x - 2 \]
\[ 1 + 2 = 4x - 3x \]
\[ 3 = x \]

So, \( x = 3 \).

#### **Step 3: Find the length of the side**
Substitute \( x = 3 \) into the expression for \( LM \):
\[ LM = 3x + 1 = 3(3) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10. \]

Thus, the side length of \( \triangle LMN \) is \( 10 \).

#### **Step 4: Verify the angle condition**
The angle at \( M \) is given as \( 5y^\circ \). Since \( \triangle LMN \) is equilateral, each internal angle is \( 60^\circ \):
\[ 5y = 60 \]
\[ y = \frac{60}{5} = 12. \]

This confirms that the angle condition is satisfied.

#### **Step 5: Compare with the answer choices**
The calculated side length of \( \triangle LMN \) is \( 10 \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 9
- B. 10
- C. 11
- D. 12

The correct answer is \( 10 \).
