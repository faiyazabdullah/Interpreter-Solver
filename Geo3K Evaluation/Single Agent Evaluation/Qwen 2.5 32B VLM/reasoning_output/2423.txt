====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with the following side lengths:
- \( AB = 2x - 7 \)
- \( BC = 4x - 21 \)
- \( AC = x - 3 \)

The problem states that \( \triangle ABC \) is an isosceles triangle with \( AB \cong BC \). This means that the lengths of \( AB \) and \( BC \) are equal. Our task is to find the length of \( AB \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Set up the equation for the isosceles condition**
Since \( AB \cong BC \), we have:
\[
AB = BC
\]
Substitute the given expressions for \( AB \) and \( BC \):
\[
2x - 7 = 4x - 21
\]

#### **Step 2: Solve for \( x \)**
Rearrange the equation to isolate \( x \):
\[
2x - 7 = 4x - 21
\]
Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:
\[
-7 = 2x - 21
\]
Add 21 to both sides:
\[
14 = 2x
\]
Divide by 2:
\[
x = 7
\]

#### **Step 3: Verify the value of \( x \)**
We need to ensure that the value of \( x = 7 \) satisfies all conditions of the triangle, including the positive length of each side.

1. Calculate \( AB \):
\[
AB = 2x - 7 = 2(7) - 7 = 14 - 7 = 7
\]

2. Calculate \( BC \):
\[
BC = 4x - 21 = 4(7) - 21 = 28 - 21 = 7
\]

3. Calculate \( AC \):
\[
AC = x - 3 = 7 - 3 = 4
\]

All side lengths are positive, and \( AB = BC = 7 \), confirming that \( \triangle ABC \) is indeed isosceles with \( AB \cong BC \).

#### **Step 4: Determine the length of \( AB \)**
From the calculations, we have:
\[
AB = 7
\]

### Final Answer:
The length of \( AB \) is \( 7 \). Comparing this with the given answer choices, we select:

\[
\boxed{C}
\]

Final Answer: C
