### Problem Analysis:
The given image depicts a parallelogram \(ABCD\). The problem asks us to find the length of \(AD\). Here's the information provided:
- \(AB = 18\)
- \(DC = 12\)
- \(\angle DAB = 115^\circ\)

Key properties of a parallelogram:
1. Opposite sides are equal in length.
2. Opposite angles are equal.
3. Adjacent angles are supplementary (sum to \(180^\circ\)).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Identify the properties of the parallelogram**
In a parallelogram:
- \(AB = CD\) and \(AD = BC\).
- Since \(AB = 18\) and \(DC = 12\), there seems to be a discrepancy. However, the problem likely intends for us to use the property that opposite sides are equal. Thus:
  - \(AB = CD = 18\)
  - \(AD = BC = x\) (where \(x\) is the length we need to find).

#### **Step 2: Use the given angle**
The angle \(\angle DAB = 115^\circ\) is given. In a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. Therefore:
\[
\angle ABC = 180^\circ - \angle DAB = 180^\circ - 115^\circ = 65^\circ
\]

#### **Step 3: Determine the length of \(AD\)** 
Since \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram, the length of \(AD\) is equal to the length of \(BC\). However, the problem does not provide a direct way to calculate \(AD\) using the given angle alone. Instead, we rely on the property that opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal.

Given:
- \(AB = 18\)
- \(DC = 12\) (but this is likely a mislabeling; in a valid parallelogram, \(AB = DC\)).

Since the problem asks for \(AD\), and we know \(AD = BC\), we must assume the correct interpretation is that \(AB = DC = 18\). Thus:
\[
AD = BC = 12
\]

#### **Step 4: Verify the answer**
The only consistent interpretation is that \(AD = 12\), as \(AD\) and \(BC\) are opposite sides of the parallelogram and must be equal. The given \(DC = 12\) is likely a labeling error, and the correct side length is \(AB = 18\).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
