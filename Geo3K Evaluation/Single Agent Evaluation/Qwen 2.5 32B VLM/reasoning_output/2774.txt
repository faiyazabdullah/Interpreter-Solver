### Problem Analysis:
The image depicts a geometric figure involving a triangle $ \triangle NOP $ with specific measurements and angles. Here's the breakdown of the given information:

1. **Triangle $ \triangle NOP $:**
   - Vertex $ O $ is connected to vertices $ N $ and $ P $.
   - $ ON = x $ (the unknown we need to find).
   - $ OP = 20\sqrt{2} $.
   - $ \angle NOP = 38^\circ $.
   - There is a right angle at $ O $, indicating $ \angle NOA = 90^\circ $.

2. **Objective:**
   - Find the length $ x $ (denoted as $ ON $) and round it to the nearest tenth.

### Thought Section:
#### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry
- The presence of a right angle at $ O $ suggests that $ \triangle NOA $ is a right triangle.
- However, the primary focus is on $ \triangle NOP $, which is an oblique triangle with one known side ($ OP = 20\sqrt{2} $), one known angle ($ \angle NOP = 38^\circ $), and the unknown side $ ON = x $.

#### Step 2: Applying Trigonometry
- Since we have a side ($ OP $) and an angle ($ \angle NOP $), we can use trigonometric relationships to find $ ON $.
- Specifically, we can use the cosine rule or trigonometric ratios. Here, the cosine function is appropriate because we know the hypotenuse ($ OP $) and the adjacent side ($ ON $).

#### Step 3: Setting Up the Equation
- In $ \triangle NOP $, the cosine of an angle is defined as:
  $$
  \cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
  $$
  Here, $ \theta = 38^\circ $, the adjacent side is $ ON = x $, and the hypotenuse is $ OP = 20\sqrt{2} $.
  $$
  \cos(38^\circ) = \frac{x}{20\sqrt{2}}
  $$

#### Step 4: Solving for $ x $
- Rearrange the equation to solve for $ x $:
  $$
  x = 20\sqrt{2} \cdot \cos(38^\circ)
  $$

#### Step 5: Calculating the Value
- Use a calculator to find $ \cos(38^\circ) $:
  $$
  \cos(38^\circ) \approx 0.788
  $$
- Substitute this value into the equation:
  $$
  x = 20\sqrt{2} \cdot 0.788
  $$
- Calculate $ 20\sqrt{2} $:
  $$
  20\sqrt{2} = 20 \cdot 1.414 \approx 28.28
  $$
- Now multiply:
  $$
  x \approx 28.28 \cdot 0.788 \approx 22.3
  $$

#### Step 6: Rounding to the Nearest Tenth
- The calculated value of $ x $ is approximately 22.3.

#### Step 7: Comparing with Answer Choices
- The closest answer choice to 22.3 is:
  - A. 17.4
  - B. 22.1
  - C. 22.3
  - D. 45.9

### Solution Section:
Based on the calculations:
$$
x \approx 22.3
$$
