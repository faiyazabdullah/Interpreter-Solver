### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves finding the length of the median \( GH \) in the quadrilateral \( RSBA \). Let's break down the given information and analyze the geometric relationships step by step.

#### **Given Information:**
1. The quadrilateral \( RSBA \) is shown in the image.
2. \( RS = 54 \) (the top horizontal line segment).
3. \( QT = 86 \) (the bottom horizontal line segment).
4. \( G \) and \( H \) are points such that \( GH \) is the median of the quadrilateral \( RSBA \).

#### **Key Observations:**
- A median in a quadrilateral typically refers to a line segment joining the midpoints of opposite sides. However, since the exact nature of \( G \) and \( H \) is not explicitly defined in the problem, we need to infer their positions based on common geometric interpretations.
- In many geometric problems involving medians, the median often connects the midpoints of two opposite sides. Here, it is reasonable to assume \( G \) is the midpoint of \( RS \) and \( H \) is the midpoint of \( AB \).

#### **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
1. **Identify Midpoints:**
   - Since \( G \) is the midpoint of \( RS \), the length \( RG = GS = \frac{RS}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \).
   - Similarly, \( H \) is the midpoint of \( AB \). However, the length of \( AB \) is not directly given. We need to infer it from the context.

2. **Assume Symmetry and Parallelism:**
   - The quadrilateral \( RSBA \) appears to have parallel sides \( RS \parallel AB \) and \( RA \parallel SB \). This suggests that \( AB \) is congruent to \( RS \) because the figure looks like a parallelogram or a rectangle.
   - Therefore, \( AB = RS = 54 \).

3. **Calculate the Median \( GH \):**
   - Since \( G \) and \( H \) are midpoints of \( RS \) and \( AB \) respectively, and \( RS \parallel AB \), the line segment \( GH \) is the average of the lengths of the parallel sides \( RS \) and \( AB \).
   - Mathematically, the length of the median \( GH \) in a trapezoid (or parallelogram) is given by:
     \[
     GH = \frac{RS + AB}{2}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     GH = \frac{54 + 54}{2} = \frac{108}{2} = 54
     \]

#### **Verification:**
- The calculation aligns with the properties of medians in quadrilaterals, especially when the quadrilateral is symmetric or has parallel sides.
- The result \( GH = 54 \) is consistent with the given answer choices.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
