### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with points \( D \), \( E \), and \( F \) on sides \( BC \), \( CA \), and \( AB \) respectively. Point \( Q \) is labeled as the **centroid** of the triangle. The problem states that \( BE = 9 \) and asks us to find the length of \( BQ \).

#### Key Observations:
1. **Centroid Definition**: The centroid \( Q \) of a triangle is the point where the medians intersect. It divides each median into a ratio of \( 2:1 \), with the longer segment being closer to the vertex.
2. **Median**: A median of a triangle is a line segment joining a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.
3. **Given Information**: \( BE = 9 \). Since \( E \) is the midpoint of \( AC \), \( BE \) is part of the median from \( B \) to \( AC \).
4. **Goal**: Find the length of \( BQ \), where \( Q \) is the centroid.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Understanding the Centroid's Property
The centroid \( Q \) divides each median into a ratio of \( 2:1 \). This means:
- If \( BE \) is the median from \( B \) to \( AC \), then \( BQ : QE = 2:1 \).
- Let \( BQ = x \) and \( QE = y \). According to the centroid property:
  \[
  \frac{BQ}{QE} = \frac{2}{1} \implies BQ = 2y \quad \text{and} \quad QE = y.
  \]
- Therefore, the total length of the median \( BE \) is:
  \[
  BE = BQ + QE = 2y + y = 3y.
  \]

#### Step 2: Using the Given Information
We are given that \( BE = 9 \). From the above relationship:
\[
BE = 3y = 9.
\]
Solving for \( y \):
\[
y = \frac{9}{3} = 3.
\]

#### Step 3: Finding \( BQ \)
Since \( BQ = 2y \):
\[
BQ = 2 \times 3 = 6.
\]

### Final Answer:
The length of \( BQ \) is \( 6 \).

\[
\boxed{B}
\]
