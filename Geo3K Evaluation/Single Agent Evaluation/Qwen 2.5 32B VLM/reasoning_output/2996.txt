### Problem Analysis:
The given figure is a parallelogram \(PQRS\). We are tasked with finding the length of side \(QP\). Let's analyze the image and extract all relevant information:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \(PQRS\) is a parallelogram.
   - The length of side \(RS\) is given as 5 units.
   - The length of side \(PS\) is given as 3 units.
   - The angle \(\angle Q = 128^\circ\) is marked, but it is not directly relevant to finding the length of \(QP\) since we are dealing with side lengths.

2. **Key properties of a parallelogram:**
   - Opposite sides are equal in length.
     - Therefore, \(PQ = RS\) and \(PS = QR\).
   - Adjacent sides are not necessarily equal unless additional information is provided (e.g., rectangle or rhombus).

3. **Objective:**
   - Find the length of \(QP\).

---

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Use the property of opposite sides in a parallelogram.
In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. Therefore:
\[
PQ = RS
\]
From the given information, \(RS = 5\). Thus:
\[
PQ = 5
\]

#### Step 2: Verify the consistency of the problem.
- The length of \(PS\) is given as 3 units, which corresponds to the side \(QR\) (since opposite sides are equal).
- The angle \(\angle Q = 128^\circ\) is provided but does not affect the side lengths directly in this context.

#### Step 3: Match the calculated result with the answer choices.
The length of \(QP\) is determined to be 5 units. Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 3
- B. 5
- C. 8
- D. 15

The correct choice is \(B\).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
