### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Image and Identify Given Information
The image shows a triangle \( \triangle RQS \) with the following details:
- Side \( RQ \) is labeled as \( 5x \).
- Side \( RS \) is labeled as \( 6x - 5 \).
- Side \( QS \) is labeled as \( 3x + 10 \).

The pink markings on \( RQ \) and \( RS \) indicate that these two sides are congruent (equal in length). Therefore, we can write:
\[ RQ = RS \]

#### Step 2: Use the Congruence Property
From the congruence of \( RQ \) and \( RS \):
\[ 5x = 6x - 5 \]

#### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
To find \( x \), solve the equation:
\[ 5x = 6x - 5 \]
Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[ 0 = x - 5 \]
Add 5 to both sides:
\[ x = 5 \]

#### Step 4: Calculate the Length of \( QS \)
Now that we have \( x = 5 \), substitute \( x \) into the expression for \( QS \):
\[ QS = 3x + 10 \]
\[ QS = 3(5) + 10 \]
\[ QS = 15 + 10 \]
\[ QS = 25 \]

#### Step 5: Verify the Solution
- Substitute \( x = 5 \) into \( RQ \):
  \[ RQ = 5x = 5(5) = 25 \]
- Substitute \( x = 5 \) into \( RS \):
  \[ RS = 6x - 5 = 6(5) - 5 = 30 - 5 = 25 \]
Both \( RQ \) and \( RS \) are equal to 25, confirming the congruence.

#### Step 6: Match the Result with the Answer Choices
The calculated length of \( QS \) is 25. Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 5
- B. 15
- C. 20
- D. 25

The correct answer is \( D \).

### Solution Section

The length of \( QS \) is calculated as follows:
1. From the congruence \( RQ = RS \), we solve \( 5x = 6x - 5 \) to find \( x = 5 \).
2. Substitute \( x = 5 \) into the expression for \( QS \):
   \[ QS = 3x + 10 = 3(5) + 10 = 25 \]

Thus, the length of \( QS \) is \( 25 \).
