### Problem Analysis:
The image depicts a kite, which is a quadrilateral with two pairs of adjacent sides that are equal. The diagonals of a kite are perpendicular to each other, and one diagonal (the shorter one) bisects the other. The given dimensions are:
- The longer diagonal (vertical) is **32 cm**.
- The shorter diagonal (horizontal) is **21 cm**.

The task is to find the area of the kite. The formula for the area of a kite is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2
\]
where \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \) are the lengths of the diagonals.

### Thought Section:
1. **Identify the diagonals:**
   - The vertical diagonal (from \( D \) to \( C \)) is given as **32 cm**.
   - The horizontal diagonal (from \( A \) to \( B \)) is given as **21 cm**.

2. **Verify the properties of the kite:**
   - The diagonals of a kite are perpendicular to each other.
   - The shorter diagonal bisects the longer diagonal.

3. **Apply the area formula:**
   - The formula for the area of a kite is:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2
     \]
   - Here, \( d_1 = 32 \) cm and \( d_2 = 21 \) cm.

4. **Calculate the area:**
   - Substitute the values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 32 \times 21
     \]
   - Perform the multiplication:
     \[
     32 \times 21 = 672
     \]
   - Then, divide by 2:
     \[
     \frac{672}{2} = 336
     \]

5. **Compare with the answer choices:**
   - The calculated area is **336**.
   - The answer choices are:
     - A. 168
     - B. 336
     - C. 672
     - D. 1344

6. **Select the correct answer:**
   - The calculated area matches option **B**.

### Solution Section:
The area of the kite is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 32 \times 21 = \frac{1}{2} \times 672 = 336
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]

### Final Answer: B
