### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
The image shows a geometric figure involving a circle and several line segments. Here's what we can extract from the image:
- A circle with points \( A \), \( P \), \( B \), and \( C \) on its circumference.
- A tangent line segment \( MA \) that touches the circle at point \( A \).
- Another tangent line segment \( MC \) that touches the circle at point \( C \).
- The length of \( MA \) is given as 10 units.
- The length of \( BC \) is given as 6 units.
- We need to find the length of \( MB \), denoted as \( y \).

#### Step 2: Identify Relevant Geometric Properties
The key property here is the **Tangent-Segment Theorem**, which states:
- If two tangent segments are drawn to a circle from the same external point, then those tangent segments are congruent.
- In this case, since \( MA \) and \( MC \) are both tangent segments from the same external point \( M \), we have:
  \[
  MA = MC = 10
  \]

#### Step 3: Use the Tangent-Segment Theorem
From the theorem, we know:
\[
MA = MC = 10
\]
This means the total length of \( MC \) is 10 units. Since \( MC \) is composed of two segments, \( MB \) and \( BC \):
\[
MC = MB + BC
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
10 = y + 6
\]

#### Step 4: Solve for \( y \)
Rearrange the equation to solve for \( y \):
\[
y = 10 - 6
\]
\[
y = 4
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the Calculation
The calculation is straightforward and aligns with the properties of tangents from a common external point. No further geometric relationships or additional theorems are needed here.

#### Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated value of \( y \) is 4. However, this value does not match any of the provided answer choices (A. 5, B. 6, C. 7.4, D. 10). Upon re-examining the problem, it appears there might be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the image or question. Let's re-evaluate:

- The image shows \( MA = 10 \) and \( BC = 6 \).
- The tangent-segment theorem confirms \( MA = MC = 10 \).
- The length \( MB \) is indeed \( 10 - 6 = 4 \).

Given the discrepancy, let's consider possible rounding or interpretation issues. However, the problem explicitly asks for \( y \) based on the given information, and the calculation is correct under standard geometric principles.

#### Step 7: Select the Closest Answer
Since the calculated value \( y = 4 \) is not among the choices, and there is no indication of rounding or approximation error in the problem statement, the closest value among the provided choices is **A. 5**.

### Solution Section

Based on the analysis and calculations:
\[
y = 10 - 6 = 4
\]
However, since 4 is not among the answer choices, the closest value is **A. 5**.

Final Answer: \boxed{A}
