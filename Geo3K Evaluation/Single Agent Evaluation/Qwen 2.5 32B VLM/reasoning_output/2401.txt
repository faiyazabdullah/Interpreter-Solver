### Problem Analysis:
The image shows an isosceles triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with:
- Two equal sides \( AB = AC = 13 \).
- The base \( BC = 10 \).
- A perpendicular line segment from vertex \( B \) to the midpoint of \( AC \), which appears to be the height of the triangle.

The task is to find the area of the triangle. The formula for the area of a triangle is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
We are given the base \( BC = 10 \). To find the area, we need to determine the height of the triangle.

---

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Identify the height of the triangle**
The height of the triangle is the perpendicular distance from vertex \( B \) to the base \( AC \). Let's denote the height as \( h \).

Since \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles, the height \( h \) will bisect the base \( AC \) into two equal segments. Therefore, the length of each segment is:
\[
\frac{BC}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5
\]

This means the height \( h \) forms a right triangle with one leg of length 5 (half of the base) and the hypotenuse equal to one of the equal sides of the isosceles triangle, which is 13.

#### **Step 2: Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height**
In the right triangle formed by the height \( h \), half of the base \( 5 \), and the side \( AB = 13 \):
\[
AB^2 = h^2 + \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
13^2 = h^2 + 5^2
\]
\[
169 = h^2 + 25
\]
Solve for \( h^2 \):
\[
h^2 = 169 - 25
\]
\[
h^2 = 144
\]
Take the square root of both sides:
\[
h = \sqrt{144} = 12
\]

#### **Step 3: Calculate the area of the triangle**
Now that we have the height \( h = 12 \) and the base \( BC = 10 \), we can use the area formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 12
\]
\[
\text{Area} = 60
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The area of the triangle is \( 60 \). Comparing this with the given answer choices, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
