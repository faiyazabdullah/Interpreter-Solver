### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Image
The image shows a geometric figure that appears to be a combination of a rectangle and a right triangle. Here's the breakdown of the given information:
- **Rectangle \( DCBA \)**:
  - \( DC = 48 \) ft (vertical side)
  - \( DA = 41 \) ft (horizontal side)
- **Right Triangle \( \triangle ABC \)**:
  - One leg is the horizontal side of the rectangle, \( AB = 41 \) ft.
  - The other leg is the difference in vertical height between points \( C \) and \( B \), which is \( CB = 53 - 41 = 12 \) ft.
  - The hypotenuse is the slanted side of the figure, but we don't need it for the area calculation.

#### Step 2: Understand What Needs to Be Found
We need to find the total area of the combined figure. This can be done by calculating the area of the rectangle and the area of the right triangle separately, then summing them.

#### Step 3: Apply Relevant Formulas
- **Area of a Rectangle**: 
  \[
  \text{Area}_{\text{rectangle}} = \text{length} \times \text{width}
  \]
- **Area of a Right Triangle**:
  \[
  \text{Area}_{\text{triangle}} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
  \]

#### Step 4: Calculate the Area of the Rectangle
The rectangle \( DCBA \) has:
- Length \( DC = 48 \) ft
- Width \( DA = 41 \) ft
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{rectangle}} = 48 \times 41 = 1968 \, \text{ft}^2
\]

#### Step 5: Calculate the Area of the Right Triangle
The right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) has:
- Base \( AB = 41 \) ft
- Height \( CB = 53 - 41 = 12 \) ft
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{triangle}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 41 \times 12 = \frac{1}{2} \times 492 = 246 \, \text{ft}^2
\]

#### Step 6: Calculate the Total Area
The total area of the figure is the sum of the areas of the rectangle and the triangle:
\[
\text{Total Area} = \text{Area}_{\text{rectangle}} + \text{Area}_{\text{triangle}} = 1968 + 246 = 2214 \, \text{ft}^2
\]

#### Step 7: Round to the Nearest Tenth
The total area is already a whole number, so no rounding is necessary.

#### Step 8: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated total area is \( 2214 \, \text{ft}^2 \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 191.5
- B. 1128
- C. 2256
- D. 4512

The closest answer choice is \( C. 2256 \).

### Solution Section

The total area of the figure is calculated as follows:
1. Area of the rectangle: \( 48 \times 41 = 1968 \, \text{ft}^2 \)
2. Area of the triangle: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 41 \times 12 = 246 \, \text{ft}^2 \)
3. Total area: \( 1968 + 246 = 2214 \, \text{ft}^2 \)

Rounding to the nearest tenth is not necessary since the result is already a whole number. The closest answer choice to \( 2214 \) is \( 2256 \).

Final Answer: **C**
