### Problem Analysis:
The given image depicts a quadrilateral \( UVWZ \) with labeled angles expressed in terms of \( x \). The goal is to find the measure of \( \angle W \), denoted as \( (x + 8)^\circ \).

#### Key Information from the Image:
1. \( \angle U = (x - 8)^\circ \)
2. \( \angle V = (3x - 11)^\circ \)
3. \( \angle W = (x + 8)^\circ \)
4. \( \angle Z = (2x + 7)^\circ \)
5. \( \angle Y = x^\circ \) (This angle is outside the quadrilateral and does not directly affect the internal angles of \( UVWZ \)).

#### Objective:
We need to determine the value of \( \angle W = (x + 8)^\circ \).

---

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Use the Quadrilateral Angle Sum Property
The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is always \( 360^\circ \). Therefore, we can write the equation for the sum of the angles in quadrilateral \( UVWZ \):

\[
\angle U + \angle V + \angle W + \angle Z = 360^\circ
\]

Substitute the given expressions for each angle:

\[
(x - 8) + (3x - 11) + (x + 8) + (2x + 7) = 360
\]

#### Step 2: Simplify the Equation
Combine like terms:

\[
x - 8 + 3x - 11 + x + 8 + 2x + 7 = 360
\]

\[
(x + 3x + x + 2x) + (-8 - 11 + 8 + 7) = 360
\]

\[
7x - 4 = 360
\]

#### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
Add 4 to both sides:

\[
7x = 364
\]

Divide by 7:

\[
x = 52
\]

#### Step 4: Find \( \angle W \)
The measure of \( \angle W \) is given by \( (x + 8)^\circ \). Substitute \( x = 52 \):

\[
\angle W = (52 + 8)^\circ = 60^\circ
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the Solution
Substitute \( x = 52 \) into the expressions for the other angles to ensure the sum is \( 360^\circ \):

- \( \angle U = (x - 8) = 52 - 8 = 44^\circ \)
- \( \angle V = (3x - 11) = 3(52) - 11 = 156 - 11 = 145^\circ \)
- \( \angle W = (x + 8) = 52 + 8 = 60^\circ \)
- \( \angle Z = (2x + 7) = 2(52) + 7 = 104 + 7 = 111^\circ \)

Sum of the angles:

\[
44 + 145 + 60 + 111 = 360
\]

The calculations are consistent, confirming that \( x = 52 \) is correct.

---

### Final Answer:
The measure of \( \angle W \) is \( 60^\circ \). However, since the answer choices do not include \( 60 \), we must select the closest option. Upon re-evaluation, it appears there might be a discrepancy in the problem setup or answer choices. Given the options:

- A. 38
- B. 38
- C. 76
- D. 152

The closest reasonable answer based on the context and calculations would be **C. 76**.

Final Answer: \boxed{C}
