### Problem Analysis:
The image depicts a triangle \( \triangle JKL \) with the following characteristics:
- Side \( JK \) is labeled as \( 3x + 6 \).
- Side \( KL \) is labeled as \( 4x \).
- Side \( JL \) is labeled as \( 5x - 6 \).
- The marks on \( JK \) and \( KL \) indicate that these sides are congruent (equal in length).

From the problem statement and the image, we need to find the value of \( x \). The key geometric property to use here is that congruent sides have equal lengths.

### Thought Section:
1. **Identify Congruent Sides:**
   - The marks on \( JK \) and \( KL \) indicate that \( JK = KL \). Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     3x + 6 = 4x
     \]

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract \( 3x \) from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     3x + 6 - 3x = 4x - 3x
     \]
     \[
     6 = x
     \]

3. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the expressions for the sides:
     - \( JK = 3x + 6 = 3(6) + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24 \)
     - \( KL = 4x = 4(6) = 24 \)
     - \( JL = 5x - 6 = 5(6) - 6 = 30 - 6 = 24 \)
   - Since \( JK = KL = 24 \), the congruence condition is satisfied.

4. **Check Against Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated value of \( x \) is 6, which matches one of the given answer choices.

### Solution Section:
The value of \( x \) is determined by solving the equation derived from the congruence of sides \( JK \) and \( KL \):
\[
3x + 6 = 4x
\]
Subtracting \( 3x \) from both sides:
\[
6 = x
\]

Thus, the value of \( x \) is \( 6 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
