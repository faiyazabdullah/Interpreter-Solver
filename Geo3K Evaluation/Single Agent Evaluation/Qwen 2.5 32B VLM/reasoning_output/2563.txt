### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the measure of angle \( \angle KJL \) in the parallelogram \( JKLM \). Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Identify the shape and properties**:
   - The figure shows a parallelogram \( JKLM \).
   - Opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal and parallel.
   - Opposite angles of a parallelogram are equal.
   - Consecutive angles are supplementary (sum to 180Â°).

2. **Given information**:
   - Side lengths: \( JM = 3a \), \( KL = 21 \), \( JL = 45 \), \( MK = 2b + 3 \).
   - Angles: \( \angle MLK = 70^\circ \) and \( \angle KML = 30^\circ \).

3. **Key observations**:
   - Since \( JKLM \) is a parallelogram, \( \angle KJL \) is related to the angles at vertices \( M \) and \( L \).
   - We need to use the properties of parallelograms and the given angles to determine \( \angle KJL \).

---

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine the angle at vertex \( M \)
In triangle \( \triangle MKL \):
- The sum of the interior angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \).
- Given \( \angle MLK = 70^\circ \) and \( \angle KML = 30^\circ \):
  \[
  \angle MKL = 180^\circ - \angle MLK - \angle KML = 180^\circ - 70^\circ - 30^\circ = 80^\circ.
  \]

#### Step 2: Use the properties of the parallelogram
In parallelogram \( JKLM \):
- Opposite angles are equal.
- Adjacent angles are supplementary.

Since \( \angle MKL = 80^\circ \) and \( \angle MKL \) is opposite to \( \angle KJM \) in the parallelogram:
\[
\angle KJM = 80^\circ.
\]

#### Step 3: Determine \( \angle KJL \)
In the parallelogram, \( \angle KJL \) is part of the triangle \( \triangle KJL \). However, we can use the fact that \( \angle KJL \) is supplementary to \( \angle KJM \) because they are consecutive angles in the parallelogram:
\[
\angle KJL = 180^\circ - \angle KJM = 180^\circ - 80^\circ = 100^\circ.
\]

However, the question asks for \( \angle KJL \), which is the angle inside the parallelogram at vertex \( J \). Since \( \angle KJL \) is part of the parallelogram and we have already determined the angles around it, we need to re-evaluate the specific angle asked for.

#### Step 4: Re-evaluate the specific angle
The angle \( \angle KJL \) is the angle formed by the diagonals or the internal angle of the parallelogram. Since \( \angle KJL \) is part of the triangle \( \triangle KJL \) and we have the adjacent angles, we can use the fact that the angle \( \angle KJL \) is the same as the angle opposite to \( \angle MKL \) in the parallelogram:
\[
\angle KJL = 80^\circ.
\]

However, the question seems to ask for a different angle, specifically \( \angle KJL \) as part of the parallelogram's internal angles. Given the options, we need to consider the supplementary angle:
\[
\angle KJL = 180^\circ - 80^\circ = 100^\circ.
\]

But the correct angle based on the options and the properties of the parallelogram is:
\[
\angle KJL = 80^\circ - 30^\circ = 50^\circ.
\]

#### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]

Final Answer: C
