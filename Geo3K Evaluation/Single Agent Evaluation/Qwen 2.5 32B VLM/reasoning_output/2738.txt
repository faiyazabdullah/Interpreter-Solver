### Problem Analysis:
The given image depicts a right triangle \( \triangle LJK \) with the following information:
- \( LK = 12 \)
- \( JK = 5 \)
- The hypotenuse \( LJ = 13 \)

We are tasked with finding the ratio of \( \tan L \) as a decimal to the nearest hundredth. The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side.

### Thought Section:
1. **Identify the Relevant Triangle and Angles**:
   - The angle \( L \) is at vertex \( L \).
   - The side opposite to \( \angle L \) is \( JK \).
   - The side adjacent to \( \angle L \) is \( LK \).

2. **Recall the Definition of Tangent**:
   \[
   \tan L = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{JK}{LK}
   \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values**:
   - Opposite side \( JK = 5 \)
   - Adjacent side \( LK = 12 \)
   \[
   \tan L = \frac{5}{12}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Decimal Value**:
   - Perform the division \( \frac{5}{12} \):
     \[
     \frac{5}{12} \approx 0.41666\ldots
     \]

5. **Round to the Nearest Hundredth**:
   - The value \( 0.41666\ldots \) rounded to the nearest hundredth is \( 0.42 \).

6. **Compare with Answer Choices**:
   - The calculated value \( 0.42 \) matches one of the provided answer choices.

### Solution Section:
Based on the steps above, we have:
\[
\tan L = \frac{5}{12} \approx 0.42
\]

Thus, the correct answer choice is:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]

### Final Answer: B
