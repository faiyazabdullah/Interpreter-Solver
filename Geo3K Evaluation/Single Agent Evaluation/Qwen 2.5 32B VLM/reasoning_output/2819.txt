### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a rhombus \(ABCD\) with the following key features:
- The diagonals of the rhombus are labeled \(AC\) and \(BD\).
- The length of diagonal \(BD\) is given as \(8\) inches.
- The length of diagonal \(AC\) is given as \(17\) inches.
- The diagonals intersect at point \(E\), which is the midpoint of both diagonals (a property of rhombuses).

The task is to find the area of the rhombus.

---

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Understand the Properties of a Rhombus
- A rhombus is a type of quadrilateral where all sides are equal in length.
- The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles (90Â°).
- The area of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2
  \]
  where \(d_1\) and \(d_2\) are the lengths of the diagonals.

#### Step 2: Identify Given Information
- Diagonal \(BD = 8\) inches.
- Diagonal \(AC = 17\) inches.

#### Step 3: Apply the Area Formula
The formula for the area of a rhombus is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2
\]
Substitute the given values:
\[
d_1 = BD = 8 \quad \text{and} \quad d_2 = AC = 17
\]
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 17
\]

#### Step 4: Perform the Calculation
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 17 = \frac{1}{2} \times 136 = 68
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the Result
- The calculation is straightforward and uses the basic property of rhombuses that the area is half the product of the diagonals.
- The result \(68\) matches one of the given answer choices.

#### Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated area is \(68\). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 68
- B. 136
- C. 272
- D. 544

The correct answer is \(68\).

### Solution Section:

The area of the rhombus is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 17 = 68
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]

Final Answer: A
