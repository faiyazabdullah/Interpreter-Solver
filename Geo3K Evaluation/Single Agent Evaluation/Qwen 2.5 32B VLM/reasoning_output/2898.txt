### Problem Analysis:
The given image depicts a composite geometric figure consisting of:
1. A rectangle in the middle.
2. Two semicircles at the top and bottom of the rectangle.

#### Key Information from the Image:
- The **length** of the rectangle is **8 units**.
- The **height** of the rectangle is **3 units**.
- The diameter of each semicircle is equal to the height of the rectangle, which is **3 units**. Therefore, the radius of each semicircle is:
  $$
  r = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ units}.
  $$

#### Objective:
We need to find the total area of the figure, which includes:
1. The area of the rectangle.
2. The combined area of the two semicircles.

---

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Calculate the Area of the Rectangle
The formula for the area of a rectangle is:
$$
\text{Area}_{\text{rectangle}} = \text{length} \times \text{width}
$$
Here, the length is **8 units** and the width (or height) is **3 units**. Thus:
$$
\text{Area}_{\text{rectangle}} = 8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ square units}.
$$

#### Step 2: Calculate the Area of One Semicircle
The formula for the area of a full circle is:
$$
\text{Area}_{\text{circle}} = \pi r^2
$$
Since we have a semicircle, its area is half of the area of a full circle:
$$
\text{Area}_{\text{semicircle}} = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2
$$
The radius of each semicircle is **1.5 units**. Substituting \( r = 1.5 \):
$$
\text{Area}_{\text{semicircle}} = \frac{1}{2} \pi (1.5)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (2.25) = \frac{2.25 \pi}{2} = 1.125 \pi
$$
Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
$$
\text{Area}_{\text{semicircle}} \approx 1.125 \times 3.14159 \approx 3.534 \text{ square units}.
$$

#### Step 3: Calculate the Total Area of the Two Semicircles
Since there are two semicircles, their combined area is:
$$
\text{Area}_{\text{two semicircles}} = 2 \times \text{Area}_{\text{semicircle}} = 2 \times 1.125 \pi = 2.25 \pi
$$
Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
$$
\text{Area}_{\text{two semicircles}} \approx 2.25 \times 3.14159 \approx 7.069 \text{ square units}.
$$

#### Step 4: Calculate the Total Area of the Figure
The total area of the figure is the sum of the area of the rectangle and the area of the two semicircles:
$$
\text{Total Area} = \text{Area}_{\text{rectangle}} + \text{Area}_{\text{two semicircles}}
$$
Substituting the values:
$$
\text{Total Area} = 24 + 7.069 \approx 31.069 \text{ square units}.
$$

#### Step 5: Round to the Nearest Tenth
Rounding **31.069** to the nearest tenth gives:
$$
\text{Total Area} \approx 31.1 \text{ square units}.
$$

---

### Final Answer:
The total area of the figure is approximately **31.1 square units**. Comparing this with the given answer choices, the closest option is:

$$
\boxed{B}
$$
