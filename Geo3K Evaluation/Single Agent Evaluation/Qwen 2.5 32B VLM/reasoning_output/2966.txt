### Problem Analysis:
The given image shows a parallelogram \(ABCD\) with diagonals intersecting at point \(F\). The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other, meaning they divide each other into equal segments. The problem provides expressions for the lengths of segments along the diagonals:
- \(CE = 3z - 4\)
- \(EB = z + 5\)

Since the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other, we know:
\[ CE = EB \]

This relationship will allow us to set up an equation and solve for \(z\).

---

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Understand the Geometric Property
The key property of a parallelogram is that its diagonals bisect each other. This means that the point of intersection \(F\) divides each diagonal into two equal parts. Therefore:
\[ CE = EB \]

#### Step 2: Express the Relationship
From the image, the segments along the diagonal \(CB\) are:
- \(CE = 3z - 4\)
- \(EB = z + 5\)

Since \(CE = EB\), we can write the equation:
\[ 3z - 4 = z + 5 \]

#### Step 3: Solve the Equation
To find \(z\), we solve the equation \(3z - 4 = z + 5\):
1. Subtract \(z\) from both sides:
   \[
   3z - z - 4 = 5
   \]
   \[
   2z - 4 = 5
   \]
2. Add 4 to both sides:
   \[
   2z = 9
   \]
3. Divide by 2:
   \[
   z = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5
   \]

#### Step 4: Verify the Solution
Substitute \(z = 4.5\) back into the expressions for \(CE\) and \(EB\):
- \(CE = 3z - 4 = 3(4.5) - 4 = 13.5 - 4 = 9.5\)
- \(EB = z + 5 = 4.5 + 5 = 9.5\)

Since \(CE = EB = 9.5\), the solution is consistent with the property that the diagonals bisect each other.

#### Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated value of \(z\) is \(4.5\). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 4
- B. 4.5
- C. 5
- D. 9.5

The correct choice is \(B\).

---

### Solution Section:

The value of \(z\) is determined by solving the equation \(3z - 4 = z + 5\), which gives \(z = 4.5\). This matches one of the provided answer choices.

Final Answer: **B**
