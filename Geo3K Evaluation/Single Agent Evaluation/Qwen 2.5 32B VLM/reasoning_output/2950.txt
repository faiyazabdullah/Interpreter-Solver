### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the measure of angle \( \angle ABC \) in the given geometric figure. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:

#### **Step 1: Identify Key Elements**
- **Point \( D \)** is the center of the circle.
- The figure contains multiple points and segments, including \( A, B, C, \) and others.
- \( AB \) and \( AC \) appear to be chords of the circle.
- The angle \( \angle ABC \) is an inscribed angle subtended by the arc \( AC \).

#### **Step 2: Understand Geometric Properties**
- **Inscribed Angle Theorem**: An inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc. Mathematically, if \( \angle ABC \) is an inscribed angle subtending arc \( AC \), and \( \angle ADC \) is the central angle subtending the same arc \( AC \), then:
  \[
  \angle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \angle ADC
  \]

#### **Step 3: Determine Central Angle \( \angle ADC \)**
- From the figure, it appears that \( \angle ADC \) is a right angle (90°). This can be inferred because the diagram suggests that \( AB \) and \( AC \) are perpendicular diameters of the circle, making \( \angle ADC = 90^\circ \).

#### **Step 4: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem**
- Using the Inscribed Angle Theorem:
  \[
  \angle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \angle ADC
  \]
- Substituting \( \angle ADC = 90^\circ \):
  \[
  \angle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times 90^\circ = 45^\circ
  \]

#### **Step 5: Verify the Calculation**
- The calculation is consistent with the Inscribed Angle Theorem. Since \( \angle ADC \) is a central angle of 90°, the inscribed angle \( \angle ABC \) must be half of that, which is 45°.

### Solution:
Based on the geometric properties and the Inscribed Angle Theorem, we have determined that:
\[
\angle ABC = 45^\circ
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
