### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a circle with several points and angles labeled. We are given:
- \( m\widehat{AC} = 160^\circ \)
- \( m\angle BEC = 38^\circ \)
We need to find \( m\angle AEB \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Given Information**
- \( m\widehat{AC} = 160^\circ \): This is the measure of the arc \( AC \) on the circle.
- \( m\angle BEC = 38^\circ \): This is the measure of the angle formed by the secants \( EB \) and \( EC \) at point \( E \) outside the circle.

#### **Step 2: Identify Relevant Geometric Relationships**
To solve for \( m\angle AEB \), we use the **External Angle Theorem for Secants**. This theorem states:
\[
m\angle BEC = \frac{1}{2} \left( m\widehat{AB} - m\widehat{CD} \right)
\]
where \( m\widehat{AB} \) and \( m\widehat{CD} \) are the measures of the intercepted arcs by the secants.

However, in this problem, we are not directly given \( m\widehat{AB} \) and \( m\widehat{CD} \). Instead, we can use the fact that the total measure of a circle is \( 360^\circ \).

#### **Step 3: Calculate \( m\widehat{AB} \) and \( m\widehat{CD} \)**
Since \( m\widehat{AC} = 160^\circ \), the remaining arc \( m\widehat{CB} \) (which is the rest of the circle not covered by \( \widehat{AC} \)) is:
\[
m\widehat{CB} = 360^\circ - m\widehat{AC} = 360^\circ - 160^\circ = 200^\circ
\]

Now, consider the angle \( \angle BEC \):
\[
m\angle BEC = 38^\circ
\]
This angle is formed by the secants \( EB \) and \( EC \), and it is related to the difference between the intercepted arcs \( \widehat{AB} \) and \( \widehat{CD} \). However, since \( \widehat{AB} \) and \( \widehat{CD} \) are not directly given, we need to use the fact that \( \angle AEB \) is an inscribed angle subtended by the arc \( \widehat{AC} \).

#### **Step 4: Use the Inscribed Angle Theorem**
The inscribed angle \( \angle AEB \) subtends the arc \( \widehat{AC} \). According to the Inscribed Angle Theorem:
\[
m\angle AEB = \frac{1}{2} \cdot m\widehat{AC}
\]
Substituting the given value of \( m\widehat{AC} \):
\[
m\angle AEB = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 160^\circ = 80^\circ
\]

#### **Step 5: Verify the Solution**
The calculation is consistent with the Inscribed Angle Theorem, which states that an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends. Therefore, \( m\angle AEB = 80^\circ \) is correct.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
