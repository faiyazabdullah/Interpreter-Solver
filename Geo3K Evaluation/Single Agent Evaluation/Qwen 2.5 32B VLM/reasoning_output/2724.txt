### Problem Analysis:
We are given two triangles, \( \triangle LMN \) and \( \triangle QRS \), and we know they are congruent (\( \triangle LMN \cong \triangle QRS \)). This means corresponding sides and angles of the two triangles are equal. We need to find the value of \( x \).

#### Step 1: Identify Corresponding Sides
From the image:
- In \( \triangle LMN \), the side opposite the right angle \( \angle L \) is \( MN \).
- In \( \triangle QRS \), the side opposite the right angle \( \angle Q \) is \( RS \).

Since the triangles are congruent, the corresponding sides are:
- \( MN = RS \)

From the image:
- \( MN = 2x + 11 \)
- \( RS = 3x - 9 \)

Thus, we can set up the equation:
\[
2x + 11 = 3x - 9
\]

#### Step 2: Solve for \( x \)
Solve the equation \( 2x + 11 = 3x - 9 \):
1. Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:
   \[
   11 = x - 9
   \]
2. Add 9 to both sides:
   \[
   20 = x
   \]

#### Step 3: Verify the Solution
We have found \( x = 20 \). Let's verify by substituting \( x = 20 \) back into the expressions for \( MN \) and \( RS \):
- \( MN = 2x + 11 = 2(20) + 11 = 40 + 11 = 51 \)
- \( RS = 3x - 9 = 3(20) - 9 = 60 - 9 = 51 \)

Since \( MN = RS = 51 \), the solution is consistent with the congruence of the triangles.

#### Step 4: Check for Consistency with Angles
The problem also mentions angles, but since the triangles are congruent, the corresponding angles are equal. The angle \( (y + 10)^\circ \) in \( \triangle LMN \) corresponds to the angle \( (2y - 40)^\circ \) in \( \triangle QRS \). However, the problem does not ask us to solve for \( y \), so we focus on the side lengths.

### Final Answer:
The value of \( x \) is \( 20 \).

\[
\boxed{B}
\]
