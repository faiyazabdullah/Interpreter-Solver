### Problem Analysis:
The given image shows a geometric figure with several labeled angles and points. We are tasked with finding the measure of \( \angle 3 \). Here's a summary of the information provided in the image:

1. \( \angle DBC = 50^\circ \)
2. \( \angle CBG = 120^\circ \)
3. \( \angle EGA = 56^\circ \)
4. \( \angle 3 \) is part of a triangle involving points \( F \), \( B \), and \( G \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Relationships**
- The point \( B \) is a common vertex for several angles. Specifically, \( \angle DBC \) and \( \angle CBG \) are adjacent angles forming a straight line at point \( B \).
- The point \( G \) is also a common vertex for several angles, including \( \angle CBG \) and \( \angle EGA \).

#### **Step 2: Calculate \( \angle ABG \)**
Since \( \angle CBG = 120^\circ \) and \( \angle EGA = 56^\circ \), we need to determine the relationship between these angles and the triangle containing \( \angle 3 \).

- The angle \( \angle ABG \) can be found by noting that \( \angle CBG \) and \( \angle EGA \) are part of the same straight line at point \( G \). However, we need to focus on the triangle \( FBG \) to find \( \angle 3 \).

#### **Step 3: Use the Triangle Sum Property**
The sum of the interior angles in any triangle is always \( 180^\circ \). In triangle \( FBG \):
- One angle is \( \angle FBG \), which is part of the straight line at point \( B \).
- Another angle is \( \angle BGF \), which is part of the straight line at point \( G \).
- The third angle is \( \angle 3 \).

To find \( \angle 3 \), we need to determine the measures of the other two angles in triangle \( FBG \).

#### **Step 4: Determine \( \angle FBG \)**
- Since \( \angle DBC = 50^\circ \) and \( \angle CBG = 120^\circ \), the angle \( \angle FBG \) is part of the triangle \( FBG \). However, we need to use the fact that the sum of angles around point \( B \) is \( 360^\circ \).

#### **Step 5: Use the Adjacent Angles**
- The angle \( \angle FBG \) can be determined by noting that \( \angle FBG = 180^\circ - \angle CBG \) because \( \angle FBG \) and \( \angle CBG \) are supplementary angles (they form a straight line).

\[ \angle FBG = 180^\circ - 120^\circ = 60^\circ \]

#### **Step 6: Determine \( \angle BGF \)**
- The angle \( \angle BGF \) is part of the triangle \( FBG \) and can be determined by noting that it is supplementary to \( \angle EGA \).

\[ \angle BGF = 180^\circ - \angle EGA = 180^\circ - 56^\circ = 124^\circ \]

#### **Step 7: Calculate \( \angle 3 \)**
Using the triangle sum property in triangle \( FBG \):

\[ \angle 3 + \angle FBG + \angle BGF = 180^\circ \]

Substitute the known values:

\[ \angle 3 + 60^\circ + 124^\circ = 180^\circ \]

Solve for \( \angle 3 \):

\[ \angle 3 = 180^\circ - 60^\circ - 124^\circ = 56^\circ \]

### Final Answer:
The measure of \( \angle 3 \) is \( 56^\circ \).
