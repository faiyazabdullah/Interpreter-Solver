### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the given information
- The image shows a geometric figure with several intersecting lines and labeled angles.
- The angle at point \( G \) is labeled as \( x^\circ \).
- Another angle at point \( E \) is given as \( 55^\circ \).
- The lines appear to form straight lines and intersect at points, creating supplementary angles.

#### Step 2: Identify key relationships
- The angle at point \( E \) is \( 55^\circ \). Since \( E \) is part of a straight line, the angle adjacent to it (forming a linear pair) will be supplementary to \( 55^\circ \). Therefore, the angle adjacent to \( 55^\circ \) is:
  \[
  180^\circ - 55^\circ = 125^\circ
  \]
- This \( 125^\circ \) angle is part of the angle at point \( G \), which is labeled as \( x^\circ \).

#### Step 3: Verify the configuration
- The angle at point \( G \) is formed by the intersection of two lines. One of these lines forms a straight line with the \( 55^\circ \) angle, making the adjacent angle \( 125^\circ \).
- The other part of the angle at \( G \) is not explicitly given but is part of the same angle \( x \). Since no additional angles are provided for \( x \), we conclude that \( x \) is simply the supplementary angle to \( 55^\circ \).

#### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
- From the above reasoning, \( x \) is the supplementary angle to \( 55^\circ \):
  \[
  x = 180^\circ - 55^\circ = 125^\circ
  \]

#### Step 5: Compare with answer choices
- The calculated value of \( x \) is \( 125^\circ \).
- The answer choices are:
  A. 55
  B. 115
  C. 125
  D. 135
- The correct answer matches option C.

### Solution Section

Based on the geometric relationships and calculations:

1. The angle at point \( E \) is \( 55^\circ \).
2. The angle adjacent to \( 55^\circ \) on a straight line is \( 180^\circ - 55^\circ = 125^\circ \).
3. This \( 125^\circ \) angle is part of the angle \( x \) at point \( G \).
4. Therefore, \( x = 125^\circ \).

Final Answer: **C**
