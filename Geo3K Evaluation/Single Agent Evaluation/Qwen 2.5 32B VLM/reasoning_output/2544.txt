QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are given a parallelogram \( JKLM \) with the following information:
- One angle, \( \angle JKL \), is marked as \( 109^\circ \).
- The side \( ML \) has a length of 6 units (though this is not directly relevant to finding the angle).

We need to determine the measure of \( \angle KLM \).

---

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Understand the Properties of a Parallelogram
A parallelogram has several key properties:
1. Opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.
2. Opposite angles are equal.
3. Consecutive angles are supplementary (i.e., they add up to \( 180^\circ \)).

#### Step 2: Identify the Relationship Between Angles
In the parallelogram \( JKLM \):
- \( \angle JKL \) and \( \angle KLM \) are consecutive angles.
- Since consecutive angles in a parallelogram are supplementary, we have:
  \[
  \angle JKL + \angle KLM = 180^\circ
  \]

#### Step 3: Substitute the Given Angle
We are given that \( \angle JKL = 109^\circ \). Substituting this into the equation:
\[
109^\circ + \angle KLM = 180^\circ
\]

#### Step 4: Solve for \( \angle KLM \)
Rearrange the equation to isolate \( \angle KLM \):
\[
\angle KLM = 180^\circ - 109^\circ
\]
\[
\angle KLM = 71^\circ
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the Solution
- The calculation is straightforward and consistent with the property that consecutive angles in a parallelogram are supplementary.
- No additional information or constraints contradict this result.

#### Step 6: Match the Solution to the Answer Choices
The calculated value of \( \angle KLM \) is \( 71^\circ \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 71
- B. 79
- C. 81
- D. 89

The correct choice is \( 71 \).

---

### Solution Section:

Based on the properties of a parallelogram and the given information:
\[
\angle KLM = 180^\circ - 109^\circ = 71^\circ
\]

Thus, the measure of \( \angle KLM \) is \( 71^\circ \).

Final Answer: \boxed{A}
