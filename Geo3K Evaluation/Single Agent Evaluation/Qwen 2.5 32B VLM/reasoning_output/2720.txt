### Problem Analysis:
We are given a geometric figure involving a rectangle $LMNP$ and a parallelogram $LKJM$. The key information provided is:
- $LN = 10$
- $LJ = 2x + 1$
- $PJ = 3x - 1$

We need to find the value of $x$.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Relationships**
1. **Rectangle $LMNP$:**
   - Opposite sides of a rectangle are equal.
   - Therefore, $LN = PM = 10$.

2. **Parallelogram $LKJM$:**
   - Opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal.
   - Therefore, $LJ = KM$ and $LK = JM$.

#### **Step 2: Identify Key Measurements**
- From the figure, $PJ$ is part of the diagonal $LP$ of the rectangle $LMNP$.
- Since $LN = 10$, the length of the diagonal $LP$ can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem in $\triangle LPN$:
  \[
  LP = \sqrt{LN^2 + NP^2}
  \]
  However, we do not have the value of $NP$ directly. Instead, we use the fact that $PJ$ is part of $LP$.

#### **Step 3: Express $LP$ in Terms of $x$**
- From the problem, $PJ = 3x - 1$.
- Since $PJ$ is part of the diagonal $LP$, and $LP$ is the full length of the diagonal, we can write:
  \[
  LP = LJ + PJ
  \]
  Substituting the given expressions for $LJ$ and $PJ$:
  \[
  LP = (2x + 1) + (3x - 1)
  \]
  Simplify:
  \[
  LP = 5x
  \]

#### **Step 4: Use the Rectangle's Diagonal Property**
- In rectangle $LMNP$, the diagonal $LP$ can also be expressed using the Pythagorean theorem:
  \[
  LP = \sqrt{LN^2 + NP^2}
  \]
  However, since we do not have the value of $NP$, we use the fact that $LP = 5x$ directly.

#### **Step 5: Solve for $x$**
- We know $LN = 10$. Since $LN$ is one side of the rectangle, and $LP = 5x$, we can set up the equation:
  \[
  5x = LP
  \]
  From the figure, $LP$ is the full diagonal, and we have already expressed it as $5x$. To find $x$, we need to ensure consistency with the given lengths.

#### **Step 6: Verify Consistency**
- The problem does not provide additional constraints on $NP$, so we focus on the relationship between $LJ$ and $PJ$.
- Given $LJ = 2x + 1$ and $PJ = 3x - 1$, we use the fact that $LP = 5x$ and solve for $x$:
  \[
  5x = LP
  \]
  Since $LP$ is consistent with the diagonal of the rectangle, we solve:
  \[
  5x = 10
  \]
  \[
  x = 2
  \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
