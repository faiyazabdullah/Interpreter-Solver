### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
- The image shows a quadrilateral with vertices labeled \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \).
- The sides \( AB \) and \( DC \) are marked as parallel (\( AB \parallel DC \)).
- An angle at vertex \( D \) is given as \( 65^\circ \).
- We need to find the value of \( x \), which is the angle at vertex \( A \).

#### Step 2: Understand Geometric Relationships
- Since \( AB \parallel DC \), the quadrilateral \( ABCD \) is a trapezoid (or parallelogram if additional properties are satisfied, but we only use the parallel property here).
- When a transversal intersects two parallel lines, corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and consecutive interior angles have specific relationships:
  - **Corresponding angles** are equal.
  - **Alternate interior angles** are equal.
  - **Consecutive interior angles** (also called same-side interior angles) are supplementary (sum to \( 180^\circ \)).

#### Step 3: Identify Relevant Angles
- The angle at \( D \) (\( 65^\circ \)) is given.
- Since \( AB \parallel DC \), the angle at \( A \) (\( x \)) and the angle at \( D \) are **consecutive interior angles** because they are on the same side of the transversal \( AD \).

#### Step 4: Apply Geometric Properties
- Consecutive interior angles formed by a transversal intersecting two parallel lines are supplementary. Therefore:
  \[
  x + 65^\circ = 180^\circ
  \]

#### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)
- Rearrange the equation to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  x = 180^\circ - 65^\circ
  \]
  \[
  x = 115^\circ
  \]

#### Step 6: Verify the Solution
- The calculation is straightforward and uses the property of consecutive interior angles being supplementary. There are no contradictions or additional constraints in the problem that would affect this result.

#### Step 7: Compare with Answer Choices
- The calculated value of \( x \) is \( 115^\circ \).
- The answer choices are:
  - A. 32.5
  - B. 65
  - C. 105
  - D. 115
- The correct choice is \( D \).

### Solution Section

The value of \( x \) is determined by the property of consecutive interior angles being supplementary when two parallel lines are cut by a transversal. Solving the equation \( x + 65^\circ = 180^\circ \) gives \( x = 115^\circ \).

Final Answer: **D**
