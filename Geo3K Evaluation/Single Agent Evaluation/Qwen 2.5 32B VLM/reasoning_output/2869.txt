### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a parallelogram \(ABCD\) with the following details:
- One side of the parallelogram (\(AD\) or \(BC\)) is labeled as \(8 \, \text{m}\).
- The height of the parallelogram, perpendicular to the base \(AD\), is labeled as \(x \, \text{m}\).
- The area of the parallelogram is given as \(148 \, \text{m}^2\).

The goal is to find the value of \(x\).

---

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Recall the formula for the area of a parallelogram.
The area \(A\) of a parallelogram is given by:
\[
A = \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
Here, the base is \(AD = 8 \, \text{m}\) and the height is \(x \, \text{m}\).

#### Step 2: Substitute the given values into the formula.
We are given:
\[
A = 148 \, \text{m}^2
\]
\[
\text{base} = 8 \, \text{m}
\]
\[
\text{height} = x \, \text{m}
\]
Substituting these into the formula:
\[
148 = 8 \times x
\]

#### Step 3: Solve for \(x\).
To isolate \(x\), divide both sides of the equation by 8:
\[
x = \frac{148}{8}
\]
Perform the division:
\[
x = 18.5
\]

#### Step 4: Verify the result.
The calculation is straightforward, and there are no additional geometric constraints or ambiguities in the problem. The value of \(x\) satisfies the area formula for the parallelogram.

#### Step 5: Match the calculated value with the answer choices.
The calculated value of \(x\) is \(18.5\). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. \(17.5\)
- B. \(18.5\)
- C. \(19.5\)
- D. \(20.5\)

The correct choice is \(B\).

---

### Solution Section:

The area of the parallelogram is given by:
\[
A = \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
148 = 8 \times x
\]
Solving for \(x\):
\[
x = \frac{148}{8} = 18.5
\]

Thus, the value of \(x\) is \(18.5\).

Final Answer: **B**
