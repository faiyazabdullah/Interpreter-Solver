### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves an **equilateral triangle** \( \triangle LMN \) with the following key details:
1. \( MP \) is the **angle bisector** of \( \angle LMN \).
2. \( MP \) also **bisects** the side \( LN \), meaning \( LP = PN \).
3. The lengths of sides \( LM \) and \( MN \) are given as expressions in terms of \( x \):
   - \( LM = 3x + 1 \)
   - \( MN = 4x - 2 \)
4. The measure of \( \angle LMP \) is given as \( 5y^\circ \).

We need to find the value of \( y \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Use the property of an equilateral triangle**
An equilateral triangle has all sides equal and all internal angles equal to \( 60^\circ \). Therefore:
\[ LM = MN = LN \]

From the given side lengths:
\[ LM = 3x + 1 \]
\[ MN = 4x - 2 \]

Since \( LM = MN \):
\[ 3x + 1 = 4x - 2 \]

#### **Step 2: Solve for \( x \)**
\[ 3x + 1 = 4x - 2 \]
\[ 1 + 2 = 4x - 3x \]
\[ 3 = x \]

#### **Step 3: Verify the side lengths**
Substitute \( x = 3 \) into the expressions for \( LM \) and \( MN \):
\[ LM = 3(3) + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10 \]
\[ MN = 4(3) - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10 \]

Thus, \( LM = MN = 10 \). Since \( \triangle LMN \) is equilateral, \( LN = 10 \) as well.

#### **Step 4: Use the angle bisector property**
In an equilateral triangle, the angle bisector of any angle also acts as the median and altitude. Therefore, \( MP \) bisects \( \angle LMN \) and \( LN \) into two equal parts:
\[ LP = PN = \frac{LN}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

#### **Step 5: Determine \( \angle LMP \)**
In an equilateral triangle, each internal angle is \( 60^\circ \). Since \( MP \) is the angle bisector of \( \angle LMN \):
\[ \angle LMP = \frac{1}{2} \times 60^\circ = 30^\circ \]

From the problem, \( \angle LMP = 5y^\circ \). Therefore:
\[ 5y = 30 \]

#### **Step 6: Solve for \( y \)**
\[ y = \frac{30}{5} = 6 \]

### Final Answer:
The value of \( y \) is \( 6 \). However, this does not match any of the provided answer choices (A: 15, B: 16, C: 17, D: 18). Upon rechecking, it appears there might be a discrepancy in the problem setup or answer choices. Given the instructions to select the closest choice, none of the provided options are correct based on the calculations.

However, since the problem explicitly asks to select one of the given choices, and no recalibration or reevaluation yields a different result, the closest possible selection would be:

\boxed{A}
