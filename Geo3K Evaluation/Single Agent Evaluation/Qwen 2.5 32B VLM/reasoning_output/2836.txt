### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Analyze the given information and the image
- The image shows three circles labeled \( G \), \( J \), and \( K \).
- Circle \( G \) intersects circle \( J \) and circle \( K \) at point \( L \).
- Circle \( J \) intersects circle \( K \) at point \( L \).
- Circle \( G \) has a radius \( GH = 10 \).
- We need to find the length \( JL \).

#### Step 2: Identify the key geometric relationships
- Since \( G \), \( J \), and \( K \) are circles, and they all intersect at point \( L \), point \( L \) is a common intersection point for all three circles.
- The radius of circle \( G \) is given as \( GH = 10 \). This means the distance from the center of circle \( G \) (point \( G \)) to any point on its circumference (including \( H \)) is 10 units.
- We need to determine the radius of circle \( J \), which is the distance from the center of circle \( J \) (point \( J \)) to the point \( L \) on its circumference.

#### Step 3: Consider the nature of the problem
- The problem does not provide explicit information about the radii of circles \( J \) or \( K \). However, since the circles intersect at a single point \( L \), we can infer that the radius of circle \( J \) is also the distance from its center \( J \) to the point \( L \).
- There is no additional information suggesting that the radius of circle \( J \) is different from the radius of circle \( G \). Therefore, we assume that the radius of circle \( J \) is the same as the radius of circle \( G \) unless stated otherwise.

#### Step 4: Apply geometric principles
- Since the problem does not provide any contradictory information or additional constraints regarding the radius of circle \( J \), we can reasonably conclude that the radius of circle \( J \) is the same as the radius of circle \( G \).
- Therefore, \( JL = GH = 10 \).

#### Step 5: Verify the answer
- The radius of circle \( G \) is given as 10.
- Since \( L \) is a point on the circumference of circle \( J \), the distance \( JL \) is the radius of circle \( J \).
- Without additional information, we assume the radius of circle \( J \) is the same as the radius of circle \( G \), which is 10.

### Solution Section:

Based on the analysis above, the radius of circle \( J \) is the same as the radius of circle \( G \), which is 10. Therefore, the length \( JL \) is also 10.

Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 5
- B. 10
- C. 10
- D. 25

The correct answer is \( 10 \).
