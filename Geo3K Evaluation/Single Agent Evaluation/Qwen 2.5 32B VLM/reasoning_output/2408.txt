### Problem Analysis:
The given problem involves a geometric figure with points \(X\), \(Y\), \(Z\), \(M\), \(N\), and \(X\). We are tasked with finding the length of \(NZ\) given the following information:
- \(XN = 6\)
- \(XM = 2\)
- \(XY = 10\)

The image shows that:
1. \(M\) and \(N\) lie on the line segment \(XZ\).
2. \(MY\) and \(NY\) form right angles with \(XY\), indicating that \(MY\) and \(NY\) are perpendicular to \(XY\).
3. The triangles \(XYM\) and \(XYN\) share the same height from \(Y\) perpendicular to \(XY\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**
The key observation here is that the triangles \(XYM\) and \(XZN\) are similar by AA (Angle-Angle) similarity:
- Both triangles share the angle at \(X\).
- Both have right angles at \(M\) and \(N\) respectively (since \(MY \perp XY\) and \(NY \perp XY\)).

Thus, by AA similarity, \(\triangle X YM \sim \triangle X ZN\).

#### **Step 2: Use Similarity Ratios**
Since the triangles are similar, the corresponding sides are proportional:
\[
\frac{XM}{XZ} = \frac{XY}{XY}
\]
However, we can use the fact that the ratios of corresponding segments on the base \(XZ\) are equal:
\[
\frac{XM}{XN} = \frac{XY}{XZ}
\]

#### **Step 3: Substitute Known Values**
We know:
- \(XM = 2\)
- \(XN = 6\)
- \(XY = 10\)

Let \(XZ = x\). Then:
\[
\frac{XM}{XN} = \frac{XY}{XZ} \implies \frac{2}{6} = \frac{10}{x}
\]

#### **Step 4: Solve for \(XZ\)** 
Simplify the proportion:
\[
\frac{2}{6} = \frac{10}{x} \implies \frac{1}{3} = \frac{10}{x}
\]
Cross-multiply to solve for \(x\):
\[
x = 10 \times 3 = 30
\]

So, \(XZ = 30\).

#### **Step 5: Find \(NZ\)** 
Since \(XZ = 30\) and \(XN = 6\), the length \(NZ\) is:
\[
NZ = XZ - XN = 30 - 6 = 24
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]

### Conclusion:
The length of \(NZ\) is \(24\). Therefore, the correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{C}
\]
