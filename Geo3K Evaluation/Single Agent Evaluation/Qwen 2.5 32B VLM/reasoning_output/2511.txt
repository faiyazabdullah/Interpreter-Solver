### Problem Analysis:
The given image depicts a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with the following features:
1. \( AB = 20 \).
2. \( AC = BC = x \), indicating that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AC = BC \).
3. There is a right angle at vertex \( C \), denoted by the pink square symbol.

We need to find the value of \( x \) (the length of the equal sides \( AC \) and \( BC \)) and round it to the nearest tenth.

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Identify the Geometric Properties
- The triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AC = BC = x \).
- The right angle at \( C \) implies that \( \triangle ABC \) is also a right triangle with the hypotenuse \( AB \).

#### Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem
In a right triangle, the relationship between the sides is given by the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
20^2 = x^2 + x^2
\]
\[
400 = 2x^2
\]

#### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
Divide both sides by 2:
\[
200 = x^2
\]
Take the square root of both sides:
\[
x = \sqrt{200}
\]

#### Step 4: Simplify the Square Root
\[
\sqrt{200} = \sqrt{100 \cdot 2} = 10\sqrt{2}
\]

#### Step 5: Approximate the Value
Using the approximation \( \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414 \):
\[
x = 10 \cdot 1.414 = 14.14
\]

#### Step 6: Round to the Nearest Tenth
Rounding \( 14.14 \) to the nearest tenth gives:
\[
x \approx 14.1
\]

#### Step 7: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated value \( x \approx 14.1 \) matches the answer choice \( C \).

### Solution Section:

Following the steps above, we have determined that:
\[
x = 10\sqrt{2} \approx 14.1
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
