### Problem Analysis:
The given image shows a geometric figure consisting of a square and a diagonal line segment labeled \( y \). The side length of the square is given as 12 units. The goal is to find the length of the diagonal \( y \).

#### Key Observations:
1. **Shape**: The figure is a square.
2. **Side Length**: Each side of the square is 12 units.
3. **Diagonal**: The line segment \( y \) is the diagonal of the square.
4. **Objective**: Find the length of the diagonal \( y \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Recall the formula for the diagonal of a square
For a square with side length \( s \), the length of the diagonal \( d \) is given by:
\[
d = s\sqrt{2}
\]
This formula comes from the Pythagorean theorem applied to the right triangle formed by two sides of the square and its diagonal.

#### Step 2: Substitute the given side length
Here, the side length \( s \) is 12. Substituting \( s = 12 \) into the formula:
\[
y = 12\sqrt{2}
\]

#### Step 3: Verify the calculation
The diagonal \( y \) forms a right triangle with two sides of the square. Using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
y^2 = 12^2 + 12^2
\]
\[
y^2 = 144 + 144
\]
\[
y^2 = 288
\]
\[
y = \sqrt{288} = \sqrt{144 \cdot 2} = 12\sqrt{2}
\]

#### Step 4: Compare with the answer choices
The calculated value of \( y \) is \( 12\sqrt{2} \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. \( 6\sqrt{2} \)
- B. \( 12\sqrt{2} \)
- C. \( 12\sqrt{3} \)
- D. 24

The correct answer matches option B.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
