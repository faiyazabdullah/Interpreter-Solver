### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a circle with several points labeled \( F, G, H, J \), and an angle marked as \( 70^\circ \) at point \( G \). The angle \( x^\circ \) is formed at point \( H \) within the triangle \( HJF \). We need to determine the value of \( x \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Identify Given Information**
- The angle \( \angle FGH = 70^\circ \).
- The points \( F, G, H, J \) lie on the circumference of a circle.
- The angle \( x \) is an interior angle of the triangle \( HJF \).

#### **Step 2: Understand the Geometric Relationships**
- Since \( F, G, H, J \) are points on the circumference of a circle, the quadrilateral \( FGJH \) is a cyclic quadrilateral.
- In a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles are supplementary. That is, the sum of the measures of opposite angles is \( 180^\circ \).

#### **Step 3: Apply the Cyclic Quadrilateral Property**
- The angle \( \angle FGH \) is given as \( 70^\circ \). This angle is subtended by the arc \( FH \).
- The angle \( \angle HJF \) (which is \( x \)) is also subtended by the same arc \( FH \) but from the opposite side of the circle.
- According to the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle subtending the same arc. However, in this context, we use the fact that the angle \( x \) is part of the cyclic quadrilateral and can be related to the given angle \( 70^\circ \).

#### **Step 4: Use the Inscribed Angle Theorem**
- The angle \( \angle FGH = 70^\circ \) is an inscribed angle subtending the arc \( FH \).
- The angle \( x \) is also an inscribed angle subtending the same arc \( FH \) but from the opposite side of the circle.
- Therefore, the angle \( x \) is equal to the given angle \( 70^\circ \) because they both subtend the same arc \( FH \).

#### **Step 5: Verify the Calculation**
- The angle \( x \) is directly determined by the Inscribed Angle Theorem, which states that inscribed angles subtending the same arc are equal.
- Hence, \( x = 70^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
The value of \( x \) is \( 70^\circ \).

Final Answer: **C**
