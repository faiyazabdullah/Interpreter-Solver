### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the measure of angle \( \angle 1 \) in the given geometric figure. The figure includes a triangle \( XYZ \) with some angles labeled, and additional angles around point \( X \). Hereâ€™s the breakdown of the given information:

1. **Triangle \( XYZ \)**:
   - \( \angle YXZ = 105^\circ \)
   - \( \angle XYZ = 24^\circ \)
   - \( \angle XZY = 23^\circ \)

2. **Point \( W \)**:
   - An external angle at \( W \) is given as \( 23^\circ \).

3. **Goal**:
   - Find \( m\angle 1 \), which is the measure of the angle at \( Y \) in the triangle \( XYZ \).

### Thought Section:
#### Step 1: Summarize the given information
- The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always \( 180^\circ \).
- We need to find \( \angle 1 \), which is part of triangle \( XYZ \).

#### Step 2: Use the triangle angle sum property
In triangle \( XYZ \):
\[
\angle YXZ + \angle XYZ + \angle XZY = 180^\circ
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
105^\circ + 24^\circ + 23^\circ = 152^\circ
\]
This confirms the sum of the interior angles of triangle \( XYZ \) is consistent with the given values.

#### Step 3: Identify \( \angle 1 \)
The angle \( \angle 1 \) is the exterior angle at vertex \( Y \) of triangle \( XYZ \). The exterior angle theorem states that an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles.

In this case, \( \angle 1 \) is the exterior angle formed by extending side \( XY \). Therefore:
\[
\angle 1 = \angle XZY + \angle XYZ
\]

#### Step 4: Calculate \( \angle 1 \)
Using the given angles:
\[
\angle 1 = \angle XZY + \angle XYZ = 23^\circ + 24^\circ = 47^\circ
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the result
The calculation is straightforward and aligns with the exterior angle theorem. No further adjustments are needed.

### Solution Section:
Based on the calculations:
\[
\angle 1 = 47^\circ
\]

Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 37.5
- B. 47
- C. 52.5
- D. 133

The correct answer is \( 47 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
