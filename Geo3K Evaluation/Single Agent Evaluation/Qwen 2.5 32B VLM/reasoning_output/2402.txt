### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a circle with center \( O \) and radius \( 13 \) inches. Chord \( CD \) is perpendicular to radius \( OB \), and the length of chord \( CD \) is given as \( 24 \) inches. We need to find the length of segment \( OX \), where \( X \) is the point of intersection of the radius \( OB \) and the chord \( CD \).

#### Step 1: Understand the Geometry
- **Circle Properties**: The radius \( OB \) is perpendicular to the chord \( CD \). When a radius is perpendicular to a chord, it bisects the chord. Therefore, \( X \) is the midpoint of \( CD \).
- **Chord Length**: Since \( CD = 24 \) inches, the length of each half of the chord is:
  \[
  CX = XD = \frac{CD}{2} = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \text{ inches}
  \]

#### Step 2: Use the Right Triangle
- The perpendicular from the center \( O \) to the chord \( CD \) creates a right triangle \( OXC \).
- In this right triangle:
  - \( OC \) is the radius of the circle, so \( OC = 13 \) inches.
  - \( CX = 12 \) inches (half the length of the chord).
  - \( OX \) is the unknown we need to find.

#### Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem
In the right triangle \( OXC \):
\[
OC^2 = OX^2 + CX^2
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
13^2 = OX^2 + 12^2
\]
\[
169 = OX^2 + 144
\]
Solve for \( OX^2 \):
\[
OX^2 = 169 - 144
\]
\[
OX^2 = 25
\]
Take the square root of both sides:
\[
OX = \sqrt{25} = 5
\]

#### Step 4: Verify the Result
- The calculation is consistent with the Pythagorean theorem.
- The length \( OX = 5 \) inches is reasonable given the dimensions of the circle and the chord.

#### Step 5: Match with Answer Choices
The calculated value of \( OX \) is \( 5 \) inches. Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 5
- B. 12
- C. 13
- D. 26

The correct answer is \( A \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
