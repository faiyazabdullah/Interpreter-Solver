### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
- The image shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
- The sides \( AB \) and \( AC \) are both labeled as 9 units.
- The angle at vertex \( A \) is given as \( 60^\circ \).

#### Step 2: Identify the Type of Triangle
- Since \( AB = AC = 9 \), the triangle is **isosceles** with \( AB \) and \( AC \) as the equal sides.
- Additionally, one of the angles (\( \angle BAC \)) is \( 60^\circ \). In an isosceles triangle with a \( 60^\circ \) angle between the equal sides, the triangle is also **equilateral**.
- Therefore, all three sides of the triangle are equal: \( AB = AC = BC = 9 \).

#### Step 3: Verify the Equilateral Property
- In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, and all angles are \( 60^\circ \).
- Since \( AB = AC = 9 \) and \( \angle BAC = 60^\circ \), it confirms that \( \triangle ABC \) is equilateral.
- Hence, the side \( BC \) must also be 9 units.

#### Step 4: Compare with Answer Choices
- The possible answer choices are:
  - A. 6
  - B. 9
  - C. 15
  - D. 60
- From the analysis, we conclude that \( BC = 9 \).

### Solution Section

Based on the geometric properties and the given information:
1. The triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is equilateral because it has two equal sides (\( AB = AC = 9 \)) and an included angle of \( 60^\circ \).
2. In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal.
3. Therefore, \( BC = 9 \).

Comparing this with the answer choices, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: **B**
