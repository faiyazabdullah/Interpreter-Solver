### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a **regular polygon** inscribed in a circle, and we are tasked with finding the measure of a **central angle**. Let's break this down step by step.

#### Step 1: Understand the Geometry
- A **regular polygon** has all sides and angles equal.
- When a regular polygon is inscribed in a circle, the center of the circle is also the center of the polygon.
- The central angle is the angle subtended at the center of the circle by two adjacent vertices of the polygon.

#### Step 2: Identify Key Information from the Image
- The image shows a circle with a regular polygon inscribed in it.
- The polygon appears to have **6 vertices** (J, K, L, M, N, P), suggesting it is a **regular hexagon**.
- The central angles are formed by connecting the center of the circle to consecutive vertices of the polygon.

#### Step 3: Use Geometric Properties
- For a regular polygon with \( n \) sides inscribed in a circle, the measure of each central angle is given by:
  \[
  \text{Central Angle} = \frac{360^\circ}{n}
  \]
- Here, the polygon has 6 vertices, so \( n = 6 \).

#### Step 4: Calculate the Central Angle
Using the formula:
\[
\text{Central Angle} = \frac{360^\circ}{6} = 60^\circ
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the Calculation
- The sum of all central angles around the center of the circle is \( 360^\circ \).
- Since there are 6 equal central angles in a regular hexagon, each central angle must be:
  \[
  \frac{360^\circ}{6} = 60^\circ
  \]
- This confirms our calculation is correct.

#### Step 6: Match the Answer with the Choices
The calculated central angle is \( 60^\circ \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 30
- B. 60
- C. 90
- D. 120

The correct choice is **B. 60**.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
