### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the given information and the geometric figure
- **Rectangle \( JKLM \)**: 
  - Opposite sides are equal and parallel.
  - All internal angles are right angles (\( 90^\circ \)).
  - \( JM \parallel KL \) and \( JK \parallel ML \).

- **Rhombus \( MLPR \)**:
  - All sides are equal.
  - Opposite angles are equal.
  - Diagonals bisect each other at right angles.

- Given angles:
  - \( \angle JMK \cong \angle RMP \)
  - \( m\angle JMK = 55^\circ \)
  - \( m\angle MRP = 70^\circ \)

- We need to find \( m\angle KLP \).

#### Step 2: Use properties of the rectangle
In rectangle \( JKLM \):
- Since \( JM \parallel KL \), \( \angle JMK \) and \( \angle KLM \) are alternate interior angles with respect to the transversal \( MK \).
- Therefore, \( \angle KLM = \angle JMK = 55^\circ \).

#### Step 3: Use properties of the rhombus
In rhombus \( MLPR \):
- The diagonals \( MP \) and \( LR \) bisect each other at right angles.
- Since \( \angle MRP = 70^\circ \), the other angle at vertex \( R \) (opposite to \( \angle MRP \)) is also \( 70^\circ \) because opposite angles in a rhombus are equal.
- The diagonal \( MP \) bisects \( \angle MRP \) and \( \angle RML \). Therefore, \( \angle RMK = \frac{1}{2} \times 70^\circ = 35^\circ \).

#### Step 4: Determine \( \angle KLP \)
- Since \( ML \parallel KP \) (as \( ML \) is a side of the rhombus and \( KP \) is parallel to it in the context of the figure), \( \angle KLP \) is the exterior angle to \( \angle KLM \) and \( \angle RMK \).
- The sum of the angles on a straight line is \( 180^\circ \). Therefore, \( \angle KLP \) can be calculated as:
  \[
  \angle KLP = 180^\circ - (\angle KLM + \angle RMK)
  \]
  Substituting the known values:
  \[
  \angle KLP = 180^\circ - (55^\circ + 35^\circ) = 180^\circ - 90^\circ = 90^\circ
  \]

#### Step 5: Reassess and verify
Upon re-examining the problem, it appears there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the angles. Let's recheck the relationships:
- \( \angle JMK = 55^\circ \) and \( \angle MRP = 70^\circ \).
- The correct approach should consider the relationship between \( \angle KLP \) and the angles formed by the diagonals and sides of the rhombus.
- Since \( \angle KLP \) is an exterior angle to the rhombus and rectangle, it should be:
  \[
  \angle KLP = 180^\circ - (\angle KLM + \angle RMK) = 180^\circ - (55^\circ + 35^\circ) = 90^\circ
  \]

However, upon further review, the correct interpretation should consider the supplementary angle relationship:
\[
\angle KLP = 180^\circ - 70^\circ = 110^\circ
\]

#### Step 6: Final verification
The correct calculation for \( \angle KLP \) is:
\[
\angle KLP = 180^\circ - 70^\circ = 110^\circ
\]

### Solution Section

Based on the detailed analysis and calculations:
\[
m\angle KLP = 110^\circ
\]
