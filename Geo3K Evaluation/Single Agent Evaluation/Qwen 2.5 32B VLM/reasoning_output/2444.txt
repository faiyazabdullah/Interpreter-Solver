### Problem Analysis:
The given image shows a right triangle \( \triangle BCD \) with a right angle at \( D \). The hypotenuse \( BC \) is labeled as 40, and one leg \( BD \) is labeled as 22. We are tasked with finding the measure of angle \( x \) (denoted as \( \angle CBD \)).

#### Key Information:
1. \( BC = 40 \) (hypotenuse).
2. \( BD = 22 \) (one leg of the right triangle).
3. \( \angle BDC = 90^\circ \) (right angle).

#### Objective:
We need to find the measure of angle \( x \) using trigonometric relationships in the right triangle \( \triangle BCD \).

---

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Identify the Relevant Trigonometric Function
In a right triangle, the tangent function relates the opposite side to the adjacent side for a given angle. Here, we can use the **tangent function** because:
- The angle \( x \) is formed between the hypotenuse \( BC \) and the adjacent side \( BD \).
- The opposite side to \( x \) is \( CD \), but we do not have its length directly.

However, since we know the lengths of the hypotenuse \( BC \) and the adjacent side \( BD \), we can use the **cosine function** instead:
\[
\cos(x) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{BD}{BC} = \frac{22}{40}
\]

#### Step 2: Calculate \( \cos(x) \)
\[
\cos(x) = \frac{22}{40} = 0.55
\]

#### Step 3: Find the Angle \( x \)
To find the angle \( x \), we use the inverse cosine function (\( \cos^{-1} \)):
\[
x = \cos^{-1}(0.55)
\]

#### Step 4: Use a Calculator
Using a calculator to find \( \cos^{-1}(0.55) \):
\[
x \approx 56.63^\circ
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the Calculation
The value \( x \approx 56.63^\circ \) seems reasonable because it is less than \( 90^\circ \) (as expected for an acute angle in a right triangle).

#### Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated value \( x \approx 56.63^\circ \) does not match any of the provided answer choices. However, we need to select the closest option. Upon reviewing the choices:
- A. 37.2
- B. 40.6
- C. 49.4
- D. 52.8

The closest value to \( 56.63^\circ \) is **52.8**.

---

### Solution Section:

After performing the calculations and comparing with the given answer choices, the closest value to the calculated angle \( x \approx 56.63^\circ \) is **52.8**.
