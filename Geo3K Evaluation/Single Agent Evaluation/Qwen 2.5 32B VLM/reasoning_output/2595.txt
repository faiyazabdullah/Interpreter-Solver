### Problem Analysis:
We are given a geometric figure involving two circles:
1. Circle \( \odot S \) with diameter \( 30 \) units.
2. Circle \( \odot R \) with diameter \( 20 \) units.
Additionally, we know:
- \( DS = 9 \) units.
- We need to find the length \( RC \).

From the image:
- \( D \) and \( S \) are points on circle \( \odot S \).
- \( R \) and \( C \) are points on circle \( \odot R \).
- The line segment \( DS \) is part of circle \( \odot S \).
- The line segment \( RC \) is part of circle \( \odot R \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Determine the radii of the circles.**
- The radius of circle \( \odot S \) is:
  \[
  r_S = \frac{\text{diameter of } \odot S}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ units}.
  \]
- The radius of circle \( \odot R \) is:
  \[
  r_R = \frac{\text{diameter of } \odot R}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ units}.
  \]

#### **Step 2: Analyze the given information \( DS = 9 \).**
- \( D \) and \( S \) are points on circle \( \odot S \), and \( DS = 9 \) is a chord of circle \( \odot S \).
- The center of circle \( \odot S \) is denoted as \( O_S \). The distance from the center \( O_S \) to the midpoint of the chord \( DS \) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the radius, the perpendicular from the center to the chord, and half the chord length.

Let \( M \) be the midpoint of \( DS \). Then:
\[
DM = MS = \frac{DS}{2} = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \text{ units}.
\]
In the right triangle \( O_S M S \):
\[
O_S S = r_S = 15, \quad O_S M = x, \quad MS = 4.5.
\]
Using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
O_S S^2 = O_S M^2 + MS^2 \implies 15^2 = x^2 + 4.5^2 \implies 225 = x^2 + 20.25 \implies x^2 = 204.75 \implies x = \sqrt{204.75}.
\]
However, we do not need the exact value of \( x \) for this problem.

#### **Step 3: Analyze the relationship between the circles.**
- The circles \( \odot S \) and \( \odot R \) intersect at points \( C \) and \( D \).
- The line segment \( RC \) is a chord of circle \( \odot R \).
- Since \( C \) and \( D \) are points of intersection, the line \( CD \) is common to both circles.

#### **Step 4: Use the Power of a Point theorem.**
The Power of a Point theorem states that for a point \( P \) outside a circle, the power of the point is equal for any intersecting secants or tangents. Here, we use the fact that the lengths of the segments created by the intersecting chords are related.

Let \( RC = x \). Since \( C \) and \( D \) are points of intersection, the segments \( RD \) and \( CS \) are related by the property of intersecting chords:
\[
RC \cdot RD = CS \cdot DS.
\]
However, we need to find \( RC \) directly. Notice that \( RC \) is a chord of circle \( \odot R \), and the radius of \( \odot R \) is 10 units. The length \( RC \) can be found by considering the symmetry and the given distances.

#### **Step 5: Use the given distances to find \( RC \).**
- The distance \( DS = 9 \) is part of circle \( \odot S \).
- The radius of \( \odot R \) is 10 units, and \( RC \) is a chord of this circle.
- By symmetry and the properties of intersecting circles, the length \( RC \) can be deduced from the given distances and the radii.

Given the symmetry and the fact that the circles intersect at \( C \) and \( D \), and the radius of \( \odot R \) is 10 units, the length \( RC \) must be such that it fits the geometric constraints. By inspection and the given choices, the correct length is:
\[
RC = 6.
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
