### Problem Analysis:
The given problem involves a geometric figure with labeled angles and expressions for their measures. We are tasked with finding the value of \( p \) based on the given angle measures:
- \( m\angle 1 = 4p + 15 \)
- \( m\angle 3 = 3p - 10 \)
- \( m\angle 4 = 6r + 5 \)

From the image, we observe that:
1. \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 3 \) are vertical angles.
2. Vertical angles are congruent, meaning \( m\angle 1 = m\angle 3 \).

This relationship will allow us to set up an equation involving \( p \). Once we solve for \( p \), we can compare our result with the given answer choices.

---

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Use the property of vertical angles**
Vertical angles are always equal. Therefore:
\[
m\angle 1 = m\angle 3
\]

Substitute the given expressions for \( m\angle 1 \) and \( m\angle 3 \):
\[
4p + 15 = 3p - 10
\]

#### **Step 2: Solve the equation for \( p \)**
Rearrange the equation to isolate \( p \):
\[
4p + 15 = 3p - 10
\]
\[
4p - 3p = -10 - 15
\]
\[
p = -25
\]

#### **Step 3: Verify the result**
The value \( p = -25 \) does not match any of the given answer choices (A: 15, B: 20, C: 25, D: 30). This suggests there might be an error in the interpretation or setup. Let us re-examine the problem and the image.

Upon re-examining the image, we notice that the angles \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 3 \) are indeed vertical angles, and the given expressions for their measures are consistent with the vertical angle property. Therefore, the equation \( 4p + 15 = 3p - 10 \) is correct.

However, the negative value for \( p \) indicates a potential issue with the problem statement or answer choices. Since the problem explicitly asks for a positive value of \( p \) and provides only positive answer choices, we must conclude that the problem setup or answer choices may contain an inconsistency.

#### **Step 4: Re-evaluate the answer choices**
Given the constraints of the problem and the answer choices, it is clear that the value of \( p \) must be one of the provided options. Since our calculation yields \( p = -25 \), which is not among the choices, we must conclude that the problem setup or answer choices are inconsistent.

#### **Step 5: Select the closest valid answer**
Since the problem explicitly asks us to select one of the provided options, and our calculation does not match any of them, we must choose the closest valid option based on the context of the problem. However, without additional clarification, we cannot determine a valid \( p \) from the given choices.

---

### Final Answer:
Given the constraints and the provided answer choices, the problem appears to have an inconsistency. However, since we are required to select one of the provided options, and none of them match our calculated result, we must conclude that the problem setup or answer choices are incorrect.

Final Answer: None of the provided options are correct based on the given information. However, if forced to select one, we would need further clarification. 

For the purpose of this exercise, I will select the closest positive value, which is:
