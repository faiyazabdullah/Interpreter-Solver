### Problem Analysis:
The problem provides a triangle with two known side lengths: \( AB = 12 \) and \( AC = 7 \). We are tasked with determining which of the given perimeter values (29, 34, 37, 38) **cannot** be the perimeter of the triangle. To solve this, we need to use the **triangle inequality theorem**, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Understanding the Triangle Inequality Theorem
The triangle inequality theorem states:
1. \( AB + AC > BC \)
2. \( AB + BC > AC \)
3. \( AC + BC > AB \)

Given:
- \( AB = 12 \)
- \( AC = 7 \)
- Let \( BC = x \).

#### Step 2: Applying the Triangle Inequality Theorem
Using the given side lengths:
1. \( AB + AC > BC \):
   \[
   12 + 7 > x \implies 19 > x \implies x < 19
   \]
2. \( AB + BC > AC \):
   \[
   12 + x > 7 \implies x > 7 - 12 \implies x > -5
   \]
   Since \( x \) represents a length, it must be positive. Thus, this condition is always satisfied for positive \( x \).
3. \( AC + BC > AB \):
   \[
   7 + x > 12 \implies x > 12 - 7 \implies x > 5
   \]

Combining these inequalities:
\[
5 < x < 19
\]

#### Step 3: Calculating the Perimeter
The perimeter \( P \) of the triangle is given by:
\[
P = AB + AC + BC = 12 + 7 + x = 19 + x
\]

#### Step 4: Determining Valid Perimeters
From the inequality \( 5 < x < 19 \):
- The minimum value of \( x \) is slightly greater than 5.
- The maximum value of \( x \) is slightly less than 19.

Thus, the range for the perimeter \( P \) is:
\[
19 + 5 < P < 19 + 19 \implies 24 < P < 38
\]

#### Step 5: Checking the Given Options
We are given the following perimeter options:
- A. 29
- B. 34
- C. 37
- D. 38

From the range \( 24 < P < 38 \):
- Perimeters 29, 34, and 37 are within the valid range.
- Perimeter 38 is **not** within the valid range because it equals the upper bound (but the strict inequality \( P < 38 \) excludes 38).

### Solution Section:

Based on the analysis:
- The perimeter \( P \) must satisfy \( 24 < P < 38 \).
- Among the given options, 29, 34, and 37 are valid, but 38 is not.

Thus, the perimeter that **cannot** be the perimeter of the triangle is \( 38 \).

Final Answer: **D**

\[
\boxed{D}
\]
