### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the value of \( x \) using the properties of the parallelogram \( MNPQ \). Let's break down the problem step by step.

#### **Step 1: Identify the given information**
- The figure shows a parallelogram \( MNPQ \).
- Opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal in length.
- The lengths of the sides are given as algebraic expressions:
  - Side \( MN = 3x - 4 \)
  - Side \( PQ = 2y + 5 \)
  - Side \( MP = 11.1 \)
  - Side \( QR = 15.4 \)
  - Side \( RP = 20 \)
  - Side \( MR = 17.9 \)

#### **Step 2: Use the property of parallelograms**
In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. Therefore:
- \( MN = PQ \)
- \( MP = QR \)
- \( MR = NP \)

From the given information:
- \( MN = 3x - 4 \)
- \( PQ = 2y + 5 \)

Since \( MN = PQ \):
\[
3x - 4 = 2y + 5
\]

#### **Step 3: Solve for \( x \)**
We need to find the value of \( x \). However, we notice that the problem does not provide enough information to solve for \( y \) directly. Instead, we focus on the relationship between \( MN \) and \( PQ \).

Given:
\[
3x - 4 = 2y + 5
\]

Rearrange to solve for \( x \):
\[
3x = 2y + 9
\]
\[
x = \frac{2y + 9}{3}
\]

#### **Step 4: Check for additional constraints**
The problem does not provide a specific value for \( y \), but it asks us to find \( x \). Since the question focuses on \( x \) and the answer choices are numerical, we infer that the expression \( 3x - 4 \) must match one of the given side lengths in the parallelogram.

#### **Step 5: Match the side lengths**
From the figure, the side \( MN \) is given as \( 3x - 4 \). We know that \( MN = PQ \), and \( PQ = 15.4 \) (since \( PQ \) is given as 15.4 in the figure).

Set \( 3x - 4 \) equal to 15.4:
\[
3x - 4 = 15.4
\]

Solve for \( x \):
\[
3x = 15.4 + 4
\]
\[
3x = 19.4
\]
\[
x = \frac{19.4}{3}
\]
\[
x = 6.4667
\]

#### **Step 6: Compare with the answer choices**
The calculated value of \( x \) is approximately 6.47, which does not match any of the given answer choices (A. 8, B. 20, C. 24, D. 32). However, since the problem asks us to select the closest answer, we need to re-evaluate the context.

Upon re-examining the problem, it appears there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation. The correct approach is to directly use the equality \( 3x - 4 = 15.4 \) and solve for \( x \) as shown. The closest answer choice to 6.47 is not listed, so we must select the closest reasonable option based on the problem's context.

#### **Step 7: Final Answer**
Given the constraints and the closest reasonable option, the correct choice is:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]

### Final Answer: A
