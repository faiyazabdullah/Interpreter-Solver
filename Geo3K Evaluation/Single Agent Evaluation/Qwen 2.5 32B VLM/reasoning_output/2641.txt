### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with an external angle at vertex \( C \). The external angle at \( C \) is given as \( 148^\circ \). The internal angles of the triangle are labeled as follows:
- \( \angle A = (2x - 15)^\circ \)
- \( \angle B = (x - 5)^\circ \)

We are tasked with finding the measure of \( \angle ABC \), which is \( \angle B \).

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Understand the relationship between the external angle and the internal angles.
The external angle at vertex \( C \) is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent internal angles of the triangle. In this case:
\[
\text{External angle at } C = \angle A + \angle B
\]
From the image, the external angle at \( C \) is given as \( 148^\circ \). Therefore:
\[
\angle A + \angle B = 148^\circ
\]

#### Step 2: Substitute the given expressions for \( \angle A \) and \( \angle B \).
We know:
\[
\angle A = (2x - 15)^\circ
\]
\[
\angle B = (x - 5)^\circ
\]
Substitute these into the equation:
\[
(2x - 15) + (x - 5) = 148
\]

#### Step 3: Simplify the equation.
Combine like terms:
\[
2x - 15 + x - 5 = 148
\]
\[
3x - 20 = 148
\]

#### Step 4: Solve for \( x \).
Add 20 to both sides:
\[
3x = 168
\]
Divide by 3:
\[
x = 56
\]

#### Step 5: Find \( \angle B \).
Now that we have \( x = 56 \), substitute \( x \) back into the expression for \( \angle B \):
\[
\angle B = (x - 5)^\circ = (56 - 5)^\circ = 51^\circ
\]

#### Step 6: Verify the solution.
To ensure the solution is correct, we can verify the value of \( \angle A \):
\[
\angle A = (2x - 15)^\circ = (2 \cdot 56 - 15)^\circ = 112 - 15 = 97^\circ
\]
Check the external angle condition:
\[
\angle A + \angle B = 97^\circ + 51^\circ = 148^\circ
\]
This matches the given external angle, confirming our solution is correct.

### Solution Section:
The measure of \( \angle ABC \) is \( 51^\circ \). Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
