### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the length of segment \( AE \) in the given geometric figure. The problem provides the following information:
- \( AB = 12 \)
- \( AC = 16 \)
- \( ED = 5 \)

The figure shows several triangles and segments, and we need to use geometric properties and relationships to determine \( AE \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Given Information**
- \( AB = 12 \): The length of segment \( AB \).
- \( AC = 16 \): The length of segment \( AC \).
- \( ED = 5 \): The length of segment \( ED \).

From the figure, we observe:
- Points \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \) lie on line segments extending from \( A \).
- Point \( E \) lies on segment \( CD \).
- Segments \( AB \), \( AC \), and \( AD \) form a triangle \( ACD \) with \( B \) and \( E \) as points on the sides.

#### **Step 2: Identify Relationships and Properties**
The figure suggests that triangles \( ABE \) and \( ACD \) may be similar due to the presence of parallel lines or proportional segments. However, the exact nature of the similarity or proportionality is not explicitly stated. We need to infer this from the given data.

#### **Step 3: Use Similarity or Proportionality**
Given the markings on the figure (arrows indicating parallelism or equal segments), it appears that \( BE \parallel CD \). This implies that triangles \( ABE \) and \( ACD \) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion.

From the similarity of triangles \( ABE \) and \( ACD \):
\[
\frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{AE}{AD}
\]

#### **Step 4: Determine Segment Lengths**
We know:
- \( AB = 12 \)
- \( AC = 16 \)
- \( ED = 5 \)

Since \( E \) lies on \( CD \), we can express \( AD \) as:
\[
AD = AC + CD
\]
However, the length of \( CD \) is not directly given. Instead, we use the fact that \( E \) divides \( CD \) in a specific ratio, which can be determined from the similarity ratio.

From the similarity ratio:
\[
\frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{AE}{AD}
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
\frac{12}{16} = \frac{AE}{AD}
\]
Simplify the ratio:
\[
\frac{3}{4} = \frac{AE}{AD}
\]

This means that \( AE \) is \( \frac{3}{4} \) of \( AD \).

#### **Step 5: Express \( AD \) in Terms of Known Segments**
Since \( E \) divides \( CD \) such that \( ED = 5 \), we can use the similarity ratio to find \( AE \). However, we need to relate \( AD \) to the given segments.

From the similarity:
\[
\frac{AE}{AD} = \frac{3}{4}
\]
Let \( AE = x \). Then:
\[
AD = \frac{4x}{3}
\]

#### **Step 6: Use the Given Segment \( ED = 5 \)**
Since \( E \) is on \( CD \), and \( ED = 5 \), we can use the total length relationship:
\[
AD = AE + ED
\]
Substitute \( AD = \frac{4x}{3} \) and \( ED = 5 \):
\[
\frac{4x}{3} = x + 5
\]

#### **Step 7: Solve for \( x \)**
Rearrange the equation:
\[
\frac{4x}{3} - x = 5
\]
Combine terms:
\[
\frac{4x - 3x}{3} = 5
\]
\[
\frac{x}{3} = 5
\]
Multiply both sides by 3:
\[
x = 15
\]

Thus, \( AE = 15 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
