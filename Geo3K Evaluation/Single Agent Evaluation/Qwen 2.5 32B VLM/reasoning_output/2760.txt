### Problem Analysis:
The problem provides a circle with center \( A \) and two diameters: \( DF \) and \( PG \). The length of diameter \( DF \) is given as 10. We are asked to find the length of segment \( DA \), which is a radius of the circle.

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Understand the Given Information
- Circle \( A \) has center \( A \).
- Two diameters are given: \( DF \) and \( PG \).
- The length of diameter \( DF \) is 10.
- Diameter \( DF \) passes through the center \( A \), so \( A \) is the midpoint of \( DF \).

#### Step 2: Recall Relevant Geometric Properties
- **Definition of Diameter**: A diameter is a line segment passing through the center of a circle with endpoints on the circumference.
- **Radius**: The radius is half the length of the diameter. If \( DF \) is the diameter, then the radius \( r \) is given by:
  \[
  r = \frac{\text{diameter}}{2}
  \]
- Since \( DA \) is a radius of the circle, its length is equal to half the length of the diameter \( DF \).

#### Step 3: Calculate the Radius
Given:
\[
DF = 10
\]
The radius \( DA \) is:
\[
DA = \frac{DF}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5
\]

#### Step 4: Verify the Calculation
- The diameter \( DF \) is explicitly given as 10.
- The radius \( DA \) is half of the diameter, which is 5.
- This calculation aligns with the definition of the radius in a circle.

#### Step 5: Match the Answer with the Choices
The calculated value of \( DA \) is 5. Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 5
- B. 10
- C. 20
- D. 25

The correct choice is **A. 5**.

### Solution Section:

Based on the geometric properties and calculations:
1. The diameter \( DF \) is 10.
2. The radius \( DA \) is half of the diameter:
   \[
   DA = \frac{DF}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5
   \]

Thus, the length of \( DA \) is 5.

Final Answer: **A**
