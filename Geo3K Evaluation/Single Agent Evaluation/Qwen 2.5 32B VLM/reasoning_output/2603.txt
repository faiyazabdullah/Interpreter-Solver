### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a geometric figure with several line segments and right angles marked. The goal is to determine the length of segment \( JH \) given specific lengths for other segments. Let's break down the problem step by step.

#### Given Information:
1. \( LK = 4 \)
2. \( MP = 3 \)
3. \( PQ = 6 \)
4. \( KJ = 2 \)
5. \( RS = 6 \)
6. \( LP = 2 \)

We need to find the length of \( JH \).

#### Observations from the Image:
- The figure appears to involve multiple right triangles and parallel lines.
- Right angles are marked at points \( L, K, J, R, Q, P \), and \( S \).
- The segments form a series of connected right triangles and rectangles.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze the Structure
The figure can be broken down into smaller parts:
- \( \triangle LKP \) is a right triangle with \( LP = 2 \) and \( MP = 3 \).
- \( \triangle KJP \) is a right triangle with \( KJ = 2 \).
- \( \triangle JHQ \) is a right triangle with \( JH \) as one of its legs.
- \( \triangle RQS \) is a right triangle with \( RS = 6 \).

#### Step 2: Use Given Lengths to Find Relationships
1. **Segment \( LP \)**:
   - \( LP = 2 \) (given).

2. **Segment \( MP \)**:
   - \( MP = 3 \) (given).

3. **Segment \( PQ \)**:
   - \( PQ = 6 \) (given).

4. **Segment \( KJ \)**:
   - \( KJ = 2 \) (given).

5. **Segment \( RS \)**:
   - \( RS = 6 \) (given).

#### Step 3: Focus on Right Triangles
- **Right Triangle \( LKP \)**:
  - \( LP = 2 \)
  - \( MP = 3 \)
  - Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle LKP \):
    \[
    LK = \sqrt{LP^2 + KP^2} = \sqrt{2^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{4 + 9} = \sqrt{13}
    \]
  - However, we are given \( LK = 4 \), so this part of the figure might not directly use the Pythagorean theorem in the same way.

- **Right Triangle \( KJP \)**:
  - \( KJ = 2 \)
  - \( JP \) is part of the next segment to be analyzed.

- **Right Triangle \( JHQ \)**:
  - We need to find \( JH \).

#### Step 4: Use Parallelism and Proportions
From the image, it appears that the segments form a pattern of similar triangles or parallel lines. Specifically:
- \( JK \parallel RS \)
- \( JH \parallel PQ \)

Given the parallel lines and the right angles, the segments are likely proportional. Let's use the given lengths to find the relationship:
- \( PQ = 6 \)
- \( RS = 6 \)
- Since \( JH \parallel PQ \) and the structure is symmetric, \( JH \) should be equal to \( RS \).

#### Step 5: Conclusion
From the symmetry and parallelism in the figure, it is clear that \( JH = RS \). Given \( RS = 6 \):
\[
JH = 6
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
