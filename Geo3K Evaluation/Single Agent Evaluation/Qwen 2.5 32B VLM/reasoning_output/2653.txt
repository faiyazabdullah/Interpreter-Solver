### Problem Analysis:
We are given a rectangle \(WXYZ\) with several labeled angles. The task is to find the measure of \(\angle 6\) given that \(m\angle 1 = 30^\circ\). Let us analyze the image and the relationships step by step.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Rectangle Properties**:
   - All interior angles of a rectangle are right angles (\(90^\circ\)).
   - Opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.

2. **Given Information**:
   - \(m\angle 1 = 30^\circ\).
   - \(\angle 1\) is part of a triangle formed by diagonal \(WX\) and segments within the rectangle.

3. **Identify Relevant Angles**:
   - \(\angle 6\) is located at vertex \(Y\) and appears to be part of a triangle involving the diagonal \(WZ\).
   - The diagonal \(WX\) intersects the diagonal \(WZ\) at point \(A\), forming several angles, including \(\angle 1\) and others.

#### Goal:
Determine \(m\angle 6\) using the given information and geometric properties.

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Understand the Role of Diagonals in a Rectangle
- The diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other and are equal in length.
- Since \(WXYZ\) is a rectangle, the diagonals \(WX\) and \(WZ\) intersect at their midpoint, say \(A\).

#### Step 2: Analyze \(\angle 1\)
- \(\angle 1\) is given as \(30^\circ\). It is part of the triangle formed by the diagonal \(WX\) and segments within the rectangle.
- Since \(WXYZ\) is a rectangle, the angles around point \(A\) (the intersection of diagonals) must satisfy the properties of triangles and rectangles.

#### Step 3: Use Angle Relationships in the Triangle
- Consider the triangle formed by points \(W\), \(X\), and \(A\). Since \(m\angle 1 = 30^\circ\), we can use the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\).
- However, we need to focus on how \(\angle 1\) relates to \(\angle 6\).

#### Step 4: Identify \(\angle 6\)
- \(\angle 6\) is located at vertex \(Y\) and is part of the triangle formed by the diagonal \(WZ\) and segments within the rectangle.
- Since \(WXYZ\) is a rectangle, the angle at \(Y\) (which is part of the larger rectangle) is a right angle (\(90^\circ\)).
- The angle \(\angle 6\) is adjacent to the right angle at \(Y\) and is part of the triangle formed by the diagonal \(WZ\).

#### Step 5: Use Complementary Angles
- The diagonal \(WZ\) divides the rectangle into two congruent right triangles.
- Since \(m\angle 1 = 30^\circ\), the angle complementary to \(\angle 1\) in the same triangle is \(60^\circ\) (because the sum of angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\)).
- This complementary relationship helps us determine the measure of \(\angle 6\).

#### Step 6: Relate \(\angle 6\) to \(\angle 1\)
- \(\angle 6\) is part of the triangle involving the diagonal \(WZ\). Since the diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other, the angles formed at the intersection are related.
- Given that \(m\angle 1 = 30^\circ\), the angle opposite to \(\angle 1\) in the same triangle is \(60^\circ\).
- Therefore, \(\angle 6\) is the angle complementary to \(30^\circ\) in the context of the rectangle's properties.

#### Step 7: Conclusion
- Since \(\angle 6\) is part of the right angle at \(Y\) and is complementary to \(\angle 1\), we have:
  \[
  m\angle 6 = 60^\circ.
  \]

---

### Solution Section:

Based on the analysis:
1. The given \(m\angle 1 = 30^\circ\).
2. Using the properties of the rectangle and the complementary angles, we determine that \(m\angle 6 = 60^\circ\).

Thus, the measure of \(\angle 6\) is \(60^\circ\).

Final Answer: \(\boxed{C}\)
