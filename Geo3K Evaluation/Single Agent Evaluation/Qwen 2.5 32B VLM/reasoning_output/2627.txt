### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a circle with points \( R \), \( S \), \( T \), and \( B \) marked on or around it. Angles \( x^\circ \) and \( 2x^\circ \) are labeled at points \( R \) and \( T \) respectively, both subtended by the same arc \( RT \). The task is to find the value of \( x \).

#### Key Observations:
1. **Points and Arcs**: Points \( R \), \( S \), and \( T \) lie on the circumference of the circle. The angle \( x \) at point \( R \) and the angle \( 2x \) at point \( T \) are both subtended by the same arc \( RT \).
2. **Central Angle vs. Inscribed Angle**: The angle subtended by an arc at the center of the circle is twice the angle subtended by the same arc at any point on the circumference. However, since we are dealing with inscribed angles here, we use the property that inscribed angles subtended by the same arc are equal.
3. **Inscribed Angles**: Both \( x \) and \( 2x \) are inscribed angles subtended by the same arc \( RT \). This implies a relationship between these angles.

### Thought Section:
1. **Identify the Relationship Between Angles**:
   - Since both \( x \) and \( 2x \) are inscribed angles subtended by the same arc \( RT \), they must satisfy a specific geometric relationship. However, the problem setup suggests a direct relationship between these angles rather than involving a central angle.

2. **Sum of Angles in a Triangle**:
   - Consider the triangle \( RST \). The angles at \( R \) and \( T \) are \( x \) and \( 2x \) respectively. The third angle at \( S \) can be denoted as \( \theta \). The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always \( 180^\circ \):
     \[
     x + 2x + \theta = 180^\circ
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     3x + \theta = 180^\circ
     \]

3. **Revisit the Geometry**:
   - The problem does not provide additional information about \( \theta \), but the relationship \( 2x = 2x \) suggests a direct proportionality or a specific configuration. Given the symmetry and the fact that \( 2x \) is twice \( x \), we infer that the configuration might involve a specific geometric property or a direct calculation.

4. **Direct Calculation**:
   - Since \( 2x \) is explicitly given as twice \( x \), and both are inscribed angles subtended by the same arc, we can directly solve for \( x \) by setting up the equation based on the given relationship:
     \[
     2x = 2x
     \]
     This confirms the relationship but does not directly solve for \( x \). Instead, we use the fact that the angles must satisfy the triangle angle sum property:
     \[
     x + 2x = 180^\circ - \theta
     \]
     Since \( \theta \) is not provided, we assume the simplest case where the angles are directly related without additional constraints. This leads us to:
     \[
     x + 2x = 180^\circ - \theta
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     3x = 180^\circ
     \]
     Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 60^\circ
     \]

5. **Verification**:
   - If \( x = 60^\circ \), then \( 2x = 120^\circ \). The angles \( x \) and \( 2x \) are consistent with the given setup, and the sum of the angles in the triangle \( RST \) is:
     \[
     x + 2x + \theta = 60^\circ + 120^\circ + \theta = 180^\circ
     \]
     This verifies our solution.

### Solution Section:
Based on the analysis and calculations, the value of \( x \) is:
\[
x = 60^\circ
\]
