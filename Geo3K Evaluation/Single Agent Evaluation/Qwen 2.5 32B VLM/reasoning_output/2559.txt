### Thought Section

1. **Identify Given Information:**
   - The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
   - Angle \( \angle ACB = 60^\circ \).
   - Side \( AB \) (opposite the right angle) is vertical and has a length of \( 8\sqrt{3} \).
   - We need to find the length of side \( AC \), which is labeled as \( x \).

2. **Analyze the Triangle:**
   - Since \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ACB = 60^\circ \), it is a 30-60-90 triangle.
   - In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio \( 1 : \sqrt{3} : 2 \):
     - The side opposite the 30° angle is the shortest side.
     - The side opposite the 60° angle is \( \sqrt{3} \) times the shortest side.
     - The hypotenuse is twice the shortest side.

3. **Determine the Role of Each Side:**
   - The side opposite the 60° angle (\( AB \)) is given as \( 8\sqrt{3} \).
   - In a 30-60-90 triangle, the side opposite the 60° angle is \( \sqrt{3} \) times the shortest side (\( BC \)).
   - Therefore, \( AB = BC \cdot \sqrt{3} \).

4. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Let \( BC = y \). Then, \( AB = y \cdot \sqrt{3} \).
   - Given \( AB = 8\sqrt{3} \):
     \[
     y \cdot \sqrt{3} = 8\sqrt{3}
     \]
   - Solve for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{8\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} = 8
     \]

5. **Find the Hypotenuse \( AC \):**
   - In a 30-60-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is twice the shortest side.
   - The shortest side \( BC = 8 \).
   - Therefore, the hypotenuse \( AC = 2 \cdot BC = 2 \cdot 8 = 16 \).

6. **Re-evaluate the Problem:**
   - The question asks for \( x \), which is the length of \( AC \).
   - From the 30-60-90 triangle properties, \( AC = 2 \cdot BC = 16 \).

7. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated value of \( x \) is \( 16 \).
   - However, none of the answer choices directly match \( 16 \). Let's recheck the problem setup and ensure no misinterpretation occurred.

8. **Recheck the Image and Ratios:**
   - The side \( AB = 8\sqrt{3} \) is correctly identified as the side opposite the 60° angle.
   - The hypotenuse \( AC \) should be \( 2 \times BC \), and \( BC = 8 \).
   - Thus, \( AC = 16 \).

9. **Conclusion:**
   - The correct value of \( x \) is \( 16 \), but since it is not listed, we need to select the closest option.

### Solution Section

Given the calculations, the correct value of \( x \) is \( 16 \). However, since \( 16 \) is not among the answer choices, we must select the closest option. The closest option to \( 16 \) is \( 16\sqrt{3} \).

**Final Answer: D**
