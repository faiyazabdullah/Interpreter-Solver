### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a geometric figure involving a circle, tangents, and angles. The key elements are:
1. Two angles labeled on the diagram: $85^\circ$ (exterior to the circle) and $230^\circ$ (interior to the circle).
2. Tangent lines at points $A$, $B$, $D$, and possibly others.
3. The goal is to find the measure of $\angle 2$.

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### 1. **Identify Given Information:**
   - The angle $85^\circ$ is marked outside the circle, likely formed by a tangent and a secant or another tangent.
   - The angle $230^\circ$ is marked inside the circle, which appears to be the measure of an arc.
   - Segments that appear tangent are indeed tangent, meaning they touch the circle at exactly one point.

#### 2. **Understand the Relationships:**
   - The angle $85^\circ$ is likely related to the tangent-secant or tangent-tangent theorem.
   - The angle $230^\circ$ represents an arc measure, which is part of the circle's circumference.
   - Since the total circumference of a circle is $360^\circ$, the remaining arc measure is:
     \[
     360^\circ - 230^\circ = 130^\circ
     \]
     This $130^\circ$ arc is the minor arc corresponding to the $230^\circ$ major arc.

#### 3. **Determine the Nature of $\angle 2$:**
   - $\angle 2$ is likely an inscribed angle or an angle formed by tangents and secants.
   - Inscribed angles are half the measure of their intercepted arcs. However, since the problem involves tangents, we need to consider the tangent-secant or tangent-tangent angle theorem.

#### 4. **Apply Relevant Theorems:**
   - **Tangent-Tangent Angle Theorem:** The angle formed by two tangents drawn from an external point to a circle is equal to half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs.
   - Let's denote the intercepted arcs as follows:
     - The larger arc is $230^\circ$.
     - The smaller arc is $130^\circ$.
   - The angle $\angle 2$ is formed by two tangents, so:
     \[
     \angle 2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( 230^\circ - 130^\circ \right)
     \]

#### 5. **Calculate $\angle 2$:**
   - Substitute the values into the formula:
     \[
     \angle 2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( 230^\circ - 130^\circ \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( 100^\circ \right) = 50^\circ
     \]
   - However, this does not match any of the given choices. Re-evaluate the context of $\angle 2$.

#### 6. **Re-evaluate the Context:**
   - The angle $85^\circ$ might be related to $\angle 2$. If $\angle 2$ is an external angle formed by tangents, it could be:
     \[
     \angle 2 = 180^\circ - 85^\circ = 95^\circ
     \]
   - But this also does not match the choices. Let's consider the possibility that $\angle 2$ is an inscribed angle related to the $130^\circ$ arc:
     \[
     \angle 2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 130^\circ = 65^\circ
     \]
   - This still does not match. Re-evaluate the problem setup.

#### 7. **Consider the Full Circle and External Angles:**
   - The angle $230^\circ$ suggests a major arc, and the angle $85^\circ$ might be an external angle related to the tangents.
   - The angle $\angle 2$ could be the supplement of the internal angle formed by the tangents:
     \[
     \angle 2 = 180^\circ - \left( \frac{1}{2} \times 130^\circ \right) = 180^\circ - 65^\circ = 115^\circ
     \]
   - This still does not match. Re-evaluate the problem setup again.

#### 8. **Final Interpretation:**
   - The angle $230^\circ$ is a major arc, and the angle $85^\circ$ is an external angle. The angle $\angle 2$ is likely the angle formed by the tangents, which is:
     \[
     \angle 2 = 180^\circ - 85^\circ = 95^\circ
     \]
   - However, considering the tangent-tangent theorem:
     \[
     \angle 2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( 230^\circ - 130^\circ \right) = 50^\circ
     \]
   - This does not match. The correct interpretation is:
     \[
     \angle 2 = 180^\circ - 85^\circ = 95^\circ
     \]

#### 9. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The closest match to our calculations is not directly available. Re-evaluate the problem setup and consider the context of the tangents and secants.

### Final Answer:
After re-evaluating the problem and considering all possible interpretations, the closest match to the given choices is:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]

Final Answer: B
