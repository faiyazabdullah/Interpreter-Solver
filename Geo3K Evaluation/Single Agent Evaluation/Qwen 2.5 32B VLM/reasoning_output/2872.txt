### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a circle with points \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \) on its circumference. An arc \( DC \) is marked with a measure of \( 218^\circ \). The angle \( \angle 1 \) is subtended by the arc \( DC \) at the center of the circle. The task is to find the measure of \( \angle 1 \).

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Identify the Given Information
- The arc \( DC \) measures \( 218^\circ \).
- \( \angle 1 \) is the central angle subtended by the arc \( DC \).

#### Step 2: Understand the Relationship Between Arcs and Central Angles
- In a circle, the measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of the arc it subtends.
- Therefore, if the arc \( DC \) measures \( 218^\circ \), the central angle \( \angle 1 \) must also measure \( 218^\circ \).

#### Step 3: Verify the Context
- The problem does not introduce any additional complexities such as inscribed angles or other geometric relationships. The focus is solely on the relationship between the arc and the central angle.

#### Step 4: Consider the Answer Choices
- The answer choices are:
  - A. \( 54.5 \)
  - B. \( 90 \)
  - C. \( 109 \)
  - D. \( 218 \)

#### Step 5: Match the Calculation with the Answer Choices
- Since the measure of the central angle \( \angle 1 \) is equal to the measure of the arc \( DC \), which is \( 218^\circ \), the correct answer must be \( 218 \).

### Solution Section:

1. **Identify the Relationship**: The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of the arc it subtends.
2. **Apply the Property**: The arc \( DC \) measures \( 218^\circ \), so the central angle \( \angle 1 \) also measures \( 218^\circ \).
3. **Compare with Answer Choices**: The correct value \( 218 \) matches option D.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
