### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the value of \( x \) such that the line segments \( BE \) and \( AD \) are perpendicular. The image provides several angles labeled in terms of \( x \) and \( y \), and we need to use these relationships to solve for \( x \).

#### Key Observations from the Image:
1. **Angles involving \( x \)**:
   - Angle \( \angle CBG = 6x^\circ \)
   - Angle \( \angle GBD = 3x^\circ \)

2. **Perpendicularity Condition**:
   - For \( BE \) and \( AD \) to be perpendicular, the angle between them must be \( 90^\circ \).

3. **Linear Pair Relationship**:
   - The angles \( \angle CBG \) and \( \angle GBD \) form a linear pair with \( \angle CBD \). Therefore:
     \[
     \angle CBG + \angle GBD = \angle CBD
     \]
     Substituting the given expressions:
     \[
     6x + 3x = \angle CBD \implies 9x = \angle CBD
     \]

4. **Vertical Angles**:
   - Since \( BE \) and \( AD \) are perpendicular, the vertical angles formed at the intersection of \( BE \) and \( AD \) will also be \( 90^\circ \).

#### Goal:
We need to determine the value of \( x \) such that the angle \( \angle CBD \) (or its related angles) ensures that \( BE \) and \( AD \) are perpendicular.

---

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Analyze the Perpendicularity Condition
For \( BE \) and \( AD \) to be perpendicular, the angle between them must be \( 90^\circ \). This implies that the sum of the angles around point \( B \) must be consistent with this condition.

#### Step 2: Use Linear Pair Relationships
The angles \( \angle CBG \) and \( \angle GBD \) form a linear pair with \( \angle CBD \):
\[
\angle CBG + \angle GBD = \angle CBD
\]
Substituting the given expressions:
\[
6x + 3x = 9x
\]
Thus, \( \angle CBD = 9x \).

#### Step 3: Relate \( \angle CBD \) to Perpendicularity
Since \( BE \) and \( AD \) are perpendicular, the angle \( \angle CBD \) must be part of a configuration that ensures the perpendicularity. Specifically, the angle \( \angle CBD \) must be such that the total angle around point \( B \) is consistent with the perpendicularity condition.

#### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
To ensure \( BE \) and \( AD \) are perpendicular, the angle \( \angle CBD \) must be \( 90^\circ \). Therefore:
\[
9x = 90^\circ
\]
Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{90^\circ}{9} = 10
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the Solution
If \( x = 10 \):
- \( \angle CBG = 6x = 6 \times 10 = 60^\circ \)
- \( \angle GBD = 3x = 3 \times 10 = 30^\circ \)
- \( \angle CBD = 9x = 9 \times 10 = 90^\circ \)

This confirms that \( \angle CBD = 90^\circ \), ensuring that \( BE \) and \( AD \) are perpendicular.

---

### Solution Section:

Based on the calculations and verification, the value of \( x \) that ensures \( BE \) and \( AD \) are perpendicular is:
\[
x = 10
\]

Thus, the correct answer choice is:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
