### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a geometric figure with specific lengths and proportional relationships. We need to determine the length of segment \( XY \) based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step.

#### **Given Information:**
1. \( RS = 6 \)
2. \( VT = 3 \)
3. \( RX \) is twice the length of \( XV \).
4. The figure appears to involve parallel lines and similar triangles (indicated by the parallel line symbols and right-angle markings).

#### **Objective:**
Find the length of \( XY \).

---

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Analyze the Proportional Relationship**
The problem states that \( RX \) is twice the length of \( XV \). Let:
\[ RX = 2x \quad \text{and} \quad XV = x \]

Since \( RX + XV = RV \), we have:
\[ RV = RX + XV = 2x + x = 3x \]

From the diagram, \( RV \) is parallel to \( ST \), and \( XY \) is parallel to \( RS \). This suggests that \( \triangle RVX \) is similar to \( \triangle RST \) by AA similarity (both have corresponding angles equal due to parallel lines).

#### **Step 2: Use Similar Triangles**
Since \( \triangle RVX \sim \triangle RST \), the corresponding sides are proportional. The ratio of similarity is determined by the ratio of the segments along the base:
\[ \frac{RV}{RS} = \frac{RX}{RT} = \frac{XV}{VT} \]

We know:
- \( RS = 6 \)
- \( VT = 3 \)
- \( RV = 3x \)

From the similarity ratio:
\[ \frac{RV}{RS} = \frac{3x}{6} = \frac{x}{2} \]

This ratio also applies to the heights of the triangles. Since \( XY \) corresponds to \( RS \) in the smaller triangle \( \triangle RVX \):
\[ \frac{XY}{RS} = \frac{XV}{VT} \]

Substitute the known values:
\[ \frac{XY}{6} = \frac{x}{3} \]

#### **Step 3: Solve for \( XY \)**
From the proportion:
\[ XY = 6 \cdot \frac{x}{3} = 2x \]

#### **Step 4: Determine the Value of \( x \)**
We know \( RV = 3x \) and \( RV \) is part of the larger triangle. However, the exact value of \( x \) is not needed to find \( XY \) because the relationship \( XY = 2x \) is sufficient. Instead, we use the fact that the ratio of the sides is consistent.

#### **Step 5: Verify the Proportionality**
The key insight is that the ratio of the sides \( \frac{XY}{RS} = \frac{XV}{VT} \) holds. Since \( RS = 6 \) and \( VT = 3 \), and \( XY \) is directly proportional to \( RS \) with the same ratio as \( XV \) to \( VT \), we can conclude:
\[ XY = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

---

### Final Answer:
The length of \( XY \) is \( 6 \).

\[
\boxed{C}
\]
