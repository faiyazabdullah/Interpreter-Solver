### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
The problem states that \( \triangle LMN \cong \triangle QRS \). This means the triangles are congruent, which implies:
- Corresponding sides are equal.
- Corresponding angles are equal.

From the image:
- The side lengths of \( \triangle LMN \) are \( 3x + 5 \) and \( 2x + 10 \).
- The side lengths of \( \triangle QRS \) are also \( 3x + 5 \) and \( 2x + 10 \).
- The angles at vertices \( N \) and \( S \) are given as \( (y + 6)^\circ \) and \( (2y - 12)^\circ \), respectively.

Since the triangles are congruent, the corresponding sides and angles must be equal. Therefore:
- \( LM = QR \)
- \( MN = RS \)
- \( LN = QS \)
- \( \angle N = \angle S \)

#### Step 2: Use the Congruence of Angles
The angles at \( N \) and \( S \) are corresponding angles in the congruent triangles. Therefore:
\[ y + 6 = 2y - 12 \]

#### Step 3: Solve for \( y \)
Solve the equation \( y + 6 = 2y - 12 \):
\[
y + 6 = 2y - 12
\]
Subtract \( y \) from both sides:
\[
6 = y - 12
\]
Add 12 to both sides:
\[
y = 18
\]

#### Step 4: Verify the Side Lengths
The side lengths of the triangles are given as \( 3x + 5 \) and \( 2x + 10 \). Since the triangles are congruent, the corresponding sides must be equal. However, the problem does not provide additional information about the specific correspondence between the sides. We need to find \( x \) using the given expressions.

#### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)
We need to find \( x \) using the given side lengths. Since the triangles are congruent, the expressions for the sides must be consistent. Let's assume the sides are corresponding as follows:
- \( LM = QR \)
- \( MN = RS \)

Given:
\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 10 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[
3x + 5 = 2x + 10
\]
Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:
\[
x + 5 = 10
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
x = 5
\]

#### Step 6: Verify the Solution
- If \( x = 5 \):
  - \( 3x + 5 = 3(5) + 5 = 15 + 5 = 20 \)
  - \( 2x + 10 = 2(5) + 10 = 10 + 10 = 20 \)
  - Both sides are equal, confirming the solution.

### Solution Section

The value of \( x \) is \( 5 \).
