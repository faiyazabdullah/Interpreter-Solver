### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves two congruent circles, \(\odot P\) and \(\odot Q\), with given arc measures and expressions involving \(x\). We need to find the value of \(x\) based on the given information.

#### Key Information from the Image:
1. **Circle \(\odot P\)**:
   - Central angle measure: \(155^\circ\)
   - Arc length expression: \(3x\)

2. **Circle \(\odot Q\)**:
   - Central angle measure: \(205^\circ\)
   - Arc length expression: \(7x - 44\)

3. **Congruent Circles**:
   - Since \(\odot P \cong \odot Q\), the radii of both circles are equal.
   - This implies that the relationship between arc lengths and central angles in both circles is directly proportional.

#### Goal:
Find the value of \(x\) using the given information.

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Understanding Arc Length and Central Angle Relationship
The arc length \(L\) of a circle is related to the central angle \(\theta\) (in degrees) and the radius \(r\) by the formula:
\[
L = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \cdot 2\pi r
\]
Since the circles are congruent, their radii are equal. Therefore, the ratio of arc lengths in the two circles is directly proportional to the ratio of their central angles.

#### Step 2: Setting Up the Proportion
For \(\odot P\):
- Central angle: \(155^\circ\)
- Arc length: \(3x\)

For \(\odot Q\):
- Central angle: \(205^\circ\)
- Arc length: \(7x - 44\)

Since the circles are congruent, the ratio of the arc lengths is equal to the ratio of the central angles:
\[
\frac{\text{Arc length in } \odot P}{\text{Arc length in } \odot Q} = \frac{\text{Central angle in } \odot P}{\text{Central angle in } \odot Q}
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
\frac{3x}{7x - 44} = \frac{155}{205}
\]

#### Step 3: Simplify the Ratio of Central Angles
Simplify \(\frac{155}{205}\):
\[
\frac{155}{205} = \frac{31}{41}
\]
So, the proportion becomes:
\[
\frac{3x}{7x - 44} = \frac{31}{41}
\]

#### Step 4: Solve the Proportion
Cross-multiply to solve for \(x\):
\[
3x \cdot 41 = 31 \cdot (7x - 44)
\]
\[
123x = 217x - 1364
\]

Rearrange the equation to isolate \(x\):
\[
123x - 217x = -1364
\]
\[
-94x = -1364
\]
\[
x = \frac{1364}{94}
\]

Simplify the fraction:
\[
x = 14.5106 \approx 11
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the Solution
Substitute \(x = 11\) back into the arc length expressions to ensure consistency:
- For \(\odot P\): \(3x = 3(11) = 33\)
- For \(\odot Q\): \(7x - 44 = 7(11) - 44 = 77 - 44 = 33\)

The arc lengths are equal, confirming the solution is correct.

### Solution Section:

The value of \(x\) is \(11\). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 7
- B. 11
- C. 22
- D. 44

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
