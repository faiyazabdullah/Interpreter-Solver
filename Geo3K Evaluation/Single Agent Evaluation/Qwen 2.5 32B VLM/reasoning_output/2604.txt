### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Image
The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with the following details:
- \( \angle C = 90^\circ \) (indicated by the right angle symbol).
- Side \( AB \) is labeled as \( x \), which is the hypotenuse.
- Side \( BC \) is labeled as \( 9 \).
- Side \( AC \) is labeled as \( x - 3 \).

#### Step 2: Identify the Geometric Relationships
Since \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle, we can apply the **Pythagorean theorem**:
\[
AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2
\]
Substituting the given labels:
\[
x^2 = (x - 3)^2 + 9^2
\]

#### Step 3: Expand and Simplify the Equation
First, expand \( (x - 3)^2 \):
\[
(x - 3)^2 = x^2 - 6x + 9
\]
Substitute this into the Pythagorean theorem equation:
\[
x^2 = (x^2 - 6x + 9) + 81
\]
Simplify the right-hand side:
\[
x^2 = x^2 - 6x + 90
\]

#### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
Subtract \( x^2 \) from both sides to eliminate \( x^2 \):
\[
0 = -6x + 90
\]
Rearrange to solve for \( x \):
\[
6x = 90
\]
\[
x = \frac{90}{6}
\]
\[
x = 15
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the Solution
Substitute \( x = 15 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the Pythagorean theorem:
- Hypotenuse \( AB = x = 15 \)
- Side \( AC = x - 3 = 15 - 3 = 12 \)
- Side \( BC = 9 \)

Check:
\[
AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2
\]
\[
15^2 = 12^2 + 9^2
\]
\[
225 = 144 + 81
\]
\[
225 = 225
\]
The equation holds true, confirming that \( x = 15 \) is correct.

#### Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated value of \( x \) is \( 15 \). This matches option B.
