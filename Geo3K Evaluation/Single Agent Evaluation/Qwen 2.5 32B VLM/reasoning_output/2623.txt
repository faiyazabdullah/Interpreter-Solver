### Problem Analysis:
We are given a trapezoid \(ABCD\) with the following details:
- \(AB\) and \(CD\) are the parallel sides (bases) of the trapezoid.
- \(S\) and \(T\) are the midpoints of the non-parallel sides (legs) \(AD\) and \(BC\), respectively.
- The lengths of the bases are given as:
  - \(AB = x + 4\)
  - \(CD = 3x + 2\)
- The length of the segment \(ST\) (the midsegment of the trapezoid) is given as \(ST = 9\).

We need to find the value of \(AB\).

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Understanding the Midsegment Theorem for Trapezoids
The midsegment \(ST\) of a trapezoid is the line segment connecting the midpoints of the non-parallel sides. According to the **Midsegment Theorem for Trapezoids**, the length of the midsegment is the average of the lengths of the two bases. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
\[
ST = \frac{AB + CD}{2}
\]

#### Step 2: Substituting the Given Values
We are given:
- \(AB = x + 4\)
- \(CD = 3x + 2\)
- \(ST = 9\)

Substitute these values into the midsegment formula:
\[
9 = \frac{(x + 4) + (3x + 2)}{2}
\]

#### Step 3: Simplifying the Equation
First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
\[
(x + 4) + (3x + 2) = x + 3x + 4 + 2 = 4x + 6
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
9 = \frac{4x + 6}{2}
\]

#### Step 4: Solving for \(x\)
To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[
9 \times 2 = 4x + 6
\]
\[
18 = 4x + 6
\]
Next, isolate \(4x\) by subtracting 6 from both sides:
\[
18 - 6 = 4x
\]
\[
12 = 4x
\]
Finally, solve for \(x\) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[
x = \frac{12}{4} = 3
\]

#### Step 5: Finding \(AB\)
Now that we have \(x = 3\), substitute this value back into the expression for \(AB\):
\[
AB = x + 4
\]
\[
AB = 3 + 4 = 7
\]

### Solution Section:

After solving the equation step by step, we find that \(AB = 7\). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 3
- B. 5
- C. 7
- D. 9

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]

### Final Answer: C
