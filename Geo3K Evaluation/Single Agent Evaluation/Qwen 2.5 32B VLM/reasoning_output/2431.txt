### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the length of segment \( WY \) in a regular hexagon \( UVWXYZ \), where each side of the hexagon is 12 cm. Let us break down the problem step by step.

---

#### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry of a Regular Hexagon**
- A regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal interior angles.
- Each interior angle of a regular hexagon is \( 120^\circ \).
- A regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles by drawing lines from the center to each vertex.

#### **Step 2: Properties of the Hexagon**
- The side length of the hexagon is given as 12 cm.
- The distance between any two opposite vertices (the diameter of the circumscribed circle) is twice the side length of the hexagon. This is because the hexagon can be inscribed in a circle, and the distance between opposite vertices is the diameter of that circle.

#### **Step 3: Identify \( WY \)**
- \( WY \) is the line segment connecting two opposite vertices of the hexagon.
- In a regular hexagon, the distance between any two opposite vertices is equal to the diameter of the circumscribed circle.
- Since the side length of the hexagon is 12 cm, the distance between opposite vertices is \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) cm.

#### **Step 4: Verify Using Geometric Relationships**
- Consider the hexagon as composed of 6 equilateral triangles. Each triangle has a side length of 12 cm.
- The line \( WY \) spans across the hexagon, passing through the center and connecting two opposite vertices.
- By symmetry and the properties of equilateral triangles, the length of \( WY \) is indeed the diameter of the circumscribed circle, which is \( 2 \times 12 = 24 \) cm.

#### **Step 5: Compare with Given Answer Choices**
- The calculated length of \( WY \) is 24 cm.
- However, none of the given answer choices directly match 24 cm. Let us re-evaluate the possible interpretations:
  - The problem might involve a different interpretation or a misunderstanding in the question's phrasing.
  - Upon re-examining the image and the question, it appears there might be a misalignment between the expected answer format and the actual calculation.

#### **Step 6: Re-evaluate the Answer Choices**
- The closest match to our calculated value (24 cm) among the given choices is not explicitly listed. However, let us consider the geometric relationships again:
  - The problem might involve a different approach, such as using the diagonal of the hexagon.
  - The diagonal of a regular hexagon (connecting non-adjacent but not opposite vertices) is \( \sqrt{3} \) times the side length. For a side length of 12 cm, the diagonal would be \( 12\sqrt{3} \).

#### **Step 7: Final Decision**
- Upon re-evaluating, the correct interpretation aligns with the diagonal of the hexagon, which is \( 12\sqrt{3} \).
- Therefore, the correct answer choice is \( C. 12\sqrt{3} \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
