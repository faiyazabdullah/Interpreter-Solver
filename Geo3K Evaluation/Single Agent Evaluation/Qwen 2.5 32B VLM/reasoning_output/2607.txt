### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Analyze the given image and identify key information
- The image shows a geometric figure with several labeled segments and angles.
- Key observations:
  - There are right angles at points \( A \), \( E \), and \( D \).
  - Segments are labeled with expressions involving \( x \):
    - \( AE = 5 \)
    - \( BC = 3 \)
    - \( CD = 2x - 8 \)
    - \( AD = x + 3 \)

#### Step 2: Understand the problem
We need to find the length of segment \( BC \). From the image, \( BC \) is already labeled as 3. However, we should verify if there are any constraints or relationships involving \( x \) that might affect this value.

#### Step 3: Identify relationships and constraints
- Since \( AE \) is perpendicular to \( EC \) and \( AD \) is perpendicular to \( DC \), triangles \( ABE \) and \( BCD \) share some geometric properties.
- The segments \( AE \) and \( CD \) are parallel (both perpendicular to \( EC \)), and \( AB \parallel DE \).

#### Step 4: Use geometric properties
- Since \( AE \parallel CD \) and \( AB \parallel DE \), quadrilateral \( AEDC \) is a trapezoid.
- The segment \( BC \) is part of the trapezoid and is explicitly labeled as 3 in the image.

#### Step 5: Verify the value of \( BC \)
- The label \( BC = 3 \) is directly given in the image.
- No additional calculations or substitutions involving \( x \) are necessary for \( BC \), as it is explicitly stated.

#### Step 6: Compare with answer choices
The value of \( BC \) is 3, but since 3 is not one of the answer choices, we need to recheck the problem constraints and ensure no误解 (misunderstanding) occurred. Upon re-evaluation, the problem seems to ask for verification or confirmation of the given value, which is already provided as 3.

### Solution Section:

Given the direct labeling in the image, \( BC = 3 \). However, since 3 is not one of the answer choices, and there is no additional context suggesting a different interpretation, we must conclude that the problem intends for us to use the given labels directly.

Since the problem asks for \( BC \) and the label is 3, but 3 is not an option, we must select the closest available answer. The closest option to 3 among the provided choices is:

Final Answer: **B. 6**
