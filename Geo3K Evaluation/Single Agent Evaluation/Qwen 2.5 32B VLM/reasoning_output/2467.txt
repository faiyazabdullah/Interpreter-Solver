### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the given information
- The image shows a circle with center \( C \).
- Points \( R, M, N, L \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
- Angles are labeled as follows:
  - \( \angle RCM = (x - 1)^\circ \)
  - \( \angle MCN = 60^\circ \)
  - \( \angle NCL = (3x + 5)^\circ \)

#### Step 2: Understand the goal
We need to find the measure of \( \angle NCL \), which is given as \( (3x + 5)^\circ \). To do this, we need to determine the value of \( x \).

#### Step 3: Use geometric properties
- Since \( C \) is the center of the circle, the angles \( \angle RCM \), \( \angle MCN \), and \( \angle NCL \) form a complete circle around point \( C \).
- The sum of these angles must equal \( 360^\circ \):
  \[
  \angle RCM + \angle MCN + \angle NCL = 360^\circ
  \]

#### Step 4: Substitute the given expressions
Substitute the given expressions for the angles:
\[
(x - 1)^\circ + 60^\circ + (3x + 5)^\circ = 360^\circ
\]

#### Step 5: Simplify the equation
Combine like terms:
\[
(x - 1) + 60 + (3x + 5) = 360
\]
\[
x - 1 + 60 + 3x + 5 = 360
\]
\[
4x + 64 = 360
\]

#### Step 6: Solve for \( x \)
Isolate \( x \):
\[
4x = 360 - 64
\]
\[
4x = 296
\]
\[
x = \frac{296}{4}
\]
\[
x = 74
\]

#### Step 7: Calculate \( \angle NCL \)
Now that we have \( x = 74 \), substitute it back into the expression for \( \angle NCL \):
\[
\angle NCL = (3x + 5)^\circ
\]
\[
\angle NCL = 3(74) + 5
\]
\[
\angle NCL = 222 + 5
\]
\[
\angle NCL = 227^\circ
\]

#### Step 8: Compare with the answer choices
The calculated value of \( \angle NCL \) is \( 227^\circ \). However, none of the answer choices (A: 60, B: 120, C: 240, D: 360) exactly match this value. The closest choice is \( C: 240 \).

### Solution Section

Based on the calculations and the given answer choices, the closest value to \( 227^\circ \) is \( 240^\circ \).
