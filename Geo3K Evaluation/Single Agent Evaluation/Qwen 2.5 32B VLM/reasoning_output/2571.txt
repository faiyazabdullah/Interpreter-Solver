### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a circle with chords \( EF \) and \( FG \). The lengths of these chords are given in terms of \( x \):
- Chord \( EF \): \( 8x + 6 \)
- Chord \( FG \): \( 10x - 4 \)

The goal is to find the value of \( x \). To solve this, we need to use geometric properties and relationships. Since the problem does not specify any additional constraints (such as the circle's radius or other relationships between the chords), we assume the lengths of the chords are directly related through an equation derived from the problem setup.

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Understanding the Given Information
The problem provides two expressions for the lengths of the chords:
- Chord \( EF = 8x + 6 \)
- Chord \( FG = 10x - 4 \)

There is no additional geometric relationship (such as equal chords, perpendicular bisectors, or specific angle measures) explicitly stated in the image. Therefore, we assume the problem intends for us to equate the two expressions, as there is no other information to suggest a different approach.

#### Step 2: Setting Up the Equation
Since the problem does not provide any additional geometric constraints, the most straightforward approach is to assume the lengths of the chords are equal. This is a common assumption when no further information is given about their relationship.

Thus, we set up the equation:
\[
8x + 6 = 10x - 4
\]

#### Step 3: Solving the Equation
We solve the equation step by step:
1. Subtract \( 8x \) from both sides:
   \[
   6 = 2x - 4
   \]
2. Add 4 to both sides:
   \[
   10 = 2x
   \]
3. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

#### Step 4: Verifying the Solution
Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the expressions for the chord lengths to ensure they are consistent:
- Length of \( EF \):
  \[
  8x + 6 = 8(5) + 6 = 40 + 6 = 46
  \]
- Length of \( FG \):
  \[
  10x - 4 = 10(5) - 4 = 50 - 4 = 46
  \]

Both expressions yield the same length, confirming that our solution is correct.

#### Step 5: Comparing with Answer Choices
The calculated value of \( x \) is \( 5 \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 1.8
- B. 5
- C. 46
- D. 90

The correct answer is \( 5 \).

### Solution Section:

The value of \( x \) is determined by solving the equation \( 8x + 6 = 10x - 4 \), which yields \( x = 5 \). This value satisfies the condition that the lengths of the chords are equal.

Final Answer: **B**

\[
\boxed{B}
\]
