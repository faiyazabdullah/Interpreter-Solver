### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a triangle \( \triangle WXY \) with points \( Z \), \( T \), and additional labeled segments. The problem asks us to find the value of \( x \), which represents the length of segment \( WT \).

#### Key Observations:
1. **Triangle \( \triangle WXY \)**:
   - \( WX = 16 \)
   - \( XY = 16 \)
   - \( WY = 20 \)

2. **Points \( Z \) and \( T \)**:
   - \( Z \) lies on \( WX \).
   - \( T \) lies on \( WY \).
   - Segment \( ZT \) is parallel to \( XY \) (indicated by the arrowheads).

3. **Given Lengths**:
   - \( ZT = 10 \)
   - \( WZ = x \)
   - \( WT = ? \) (to be determined)

#### Goal:
We need to find the length \( x \) using the geometric relationships in the figure.

---

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the Similarity
Since \( ZT \parallel XY \), triangles \( \triangle WZT \) and \( \triangle WXY \) are similar by the Basic Proportionality Theorem (also known as Thales' Theorem). This theorem states that if a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle intersecting the other two sides, then it divides those sides proportionally.

Thus, we have:
\[
\frac{WZ}{WX} = \frac{WT}{WY} = \frac{ZT}{XY}
\]

#### Step 2: Use the Given Lengths
From the figure:
- \( WX = 16 \)
- \( WY = 20 \)
- \( ZT = 10 \)
- \( XY = 16 \)

Substitute these values into the similarity ratio:
\[
\frac{WZ}{16} = \frac{ZT}{XY} = \frac{10}{16} = \frac{5}{8}
\]

#### Step 3: Solve for \( WZ \)
Using the ratio \( \frac{WZ}{16} = \frac{5}{8} \):
\[
WZ = 16 \times \frac{5}{8} = 10
\]
Thus, \( x = WZ = 10 \).

#### Step 4: Verify the Proportion for \( WT \)
Using the same similarity ratio \( \frac{WT}{WY} = \frac{5}{8} \):
\[
\frac{WT}{20} = \frac{5}{8}
\]
\[
WT = 20 \times \frac{5}{8} = 12.5
\]

This confirms that the segments are proportional, and our value for \( WZ \) is consistent.

---

### Final Answer:
The value of \( x \) is \( 10 \).

\[
\boxed{B}
\]
