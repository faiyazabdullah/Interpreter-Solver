### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the given information
- The quadrilateral \(EFGH\) is a **rectangle**.
- In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. Therefore:
  \[
  EF = HG \quad \text{and} \quad EH = FG
  \]
- The lengths of the sides are given as:
  \[
  EF = 4x - 6 \quad \text{and} \quad HG = x + 3
  \]

#### Step 2: Use the property of rectangles
Since \(EF\) and \(HG\) are opposite sides of the rectangle, they must be equal:
\[
EF = HG
\]
Substitute the given expressions for \(EF\) and \(HG\):
\[
4x - 6 = x + 3
\]

#### Step 3: Solve the equation
To find \(x\), solve the equation \(4x - 6 = x + 3\):
1. Subtract \(x\) from both sides:
   \[
   4x - x - 6 = 3 \implies 3x - 6 = 3
   \]
2. Add 6 to both sides:
   \[
   3x - 6 + 6 = 3 + 6 \implies 3x = 9
   \]
3. Divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   x = 3
   \]

#### Step 4: Find the value of \(EF\)
Now that we have \(x = 3\), substitute \(x\) back into the expression for \(EF\):
\[
EF = 4x - 6
\]
\[
EF = 4(3) - 6 = 12 - 6 = 6
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the solution
- Substitute \(x = 3\) into the expression for \(HG\):
  \[
  HG = x + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6
  \]
- Since \(EF = HG = 6\), the solution satisfies the condition that opposite sides of a rectangle are equal.

#### Step 6: Compare with the answer choices
The calculated value of \(EF\) is 6. The answer choices are:
A. 6
B. 12
C. 18
D. 20

The correct answer matches choice A.

### Solution Section

The value of \(EF\) is:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]
