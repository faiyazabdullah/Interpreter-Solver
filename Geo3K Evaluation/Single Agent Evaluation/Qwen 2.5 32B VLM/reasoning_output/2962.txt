### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a circle with a central angle of \(93^\circ\) and a radius of \(15 \, \text{mm}\). The shaded region is a sector of the circle. We are tasked with finding the area of this shaded sector.

#### Key Information from the Image:
1. **Radius (\(r\))**: \(15 \, \text{mm}\)
2. **Central Angle (\(\theta\))**: \(93^\circ\)

#### Goal:
Find the area of the shaded sector, rounded to the nearest tenth.

---

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Recall the Formula for the Area of a Sector
The area of a sector of a circle is given by:
\[
\text{Area of Sector} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi r^2
\]
where:
- \(\theta\) is the central angle in degrees,
- \(r\) is the radius of the circle,
- \(\pi\) is approximately \(3.14159\).

#### Step 2: Substitute the Given Values
From the image:
- \(\theta = 93^\circ\),
- \(r = 15 \, \text{mm}\).

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[
\text{Area of Sector} = \frac{93}{360} \times \pi \times (15)^2
\]

#### Step 3: Simplify the Expression
First, calculate \(r^2\):
\[
r^2 = 15^2 = 225
\]

Next, substitute \(r^2\) into the formula:
\[
\text{Area of Sector} = \frac{93}{360} \times \pi \times 225
\]

Simplify the fraction \(\frac{93}{360}\):
\[
\frac{93}{360} = \frac{31}{120}
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
\text{Area of Sector} = \frac{31}{120} \times \pi \times 225
\]

#### Step 4: Perform the Multiplication
Calculate \(\frac{31}{120} \times 225\):
\[
\frac{31}{120} \times 225 = \frac{31 \times 225}{120} = \frac{7012.5}{120} = 58.4375
\]

Now multiply by \(\pi\):
\[
\text{Area of Sector} = 58.4375 \times \pi
\]

Using \(\pi \approx 3.14159\):
\[
\text{Area of Sector} \approx 58.4375 \times 3.14159 \approx 183.57
\]

#### Step 5: Round to the Nearest Tenth
Rounding \(183.57\) to the nearest tenth gives:
\[
183.6
\]

#### Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated area is \(183.6\), which is closest to the answer choice \(182.6\).

---

### Solution Section:

After performing the calculations step by step, the area of the shaded sector is approximately \(183.6\). However, since we need to select the closest answer choice, the correct choice is:

\[
\boxed{C}
\]
