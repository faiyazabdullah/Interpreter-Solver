### Problem Analysis:
The image depicts a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with several segments and points labeled. Here's the breakdown of the given information:
- \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \).
- \( BC = 8 \).
- There is a smaller right triangle \( \triangle DBC \) within \( \triangle ABC \), where \( D \) is a point on \( AB \) and \( DC \perp AB \).
- \( DC = 6 \).
- We need to find the length of \( AB \), denoted as \( z \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**
The key to solving this problem is recognizing that \( \triangle DBC \) is similar to \( \triangle ABC \) because both are right triangles sharing the same angle at \( C \). This similarity will allow us to use proportional relationships between the sides.

#### **Step 2: Use Similarity of Triangles**
Since \( \triangle DBC \sim \triangle ABC \):
- The ratio of corresponding sides in similar triangles is equal. Specifically:
  \[
  \frac{DC}{BC} = \frac{BC}{AB}
  \]
  Substituting the known values:
  \[
  \frac{6}{8} = \frac{8}{z}
  \]

#### **Step 3: Solve for \( z \)**
From the proportion:
\[
\frac{6}{8} = \frac{8}{z}
\]
Cross-multiply to solve for \( z \):
\[
6z = 8 \times 8
\]
\[
6z = 64
\]
\[
z = \frac{64}{6} = \frac{32}{3}
\]

#### **Step 4: Verify the Result**
The value \( z = \frac{32}{3} \) satisfies the similarity condition and the given dimensions. No further adjustments are needed.

### Final Answer:
The length of \( AB \) is \( \frac{32}{3} \).

\[
\boxed{B}
\]
