### Problem Analysis:
The given image shows a geometric figure with several labeled angles. The key elements are:
- Angle at point \( A \) formed by line segments \( AE \) and \( AB \), labeled as \( (8y + 2)^\circ \).
- Angle at point \( B \) formed by line segments \( BC \) and \( BF \), labeled as \( (25y - 20)^\circ \).

The problem asks us to find the value of \( y \). To solve this, we need to use the properties of angles and the relationships between them.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Identify the relationship between the angles**
From the image, it appears that the angles \( (8y + 2)^\circ \) and \( (25y - 20)^\circ \) are related. However, the exact relationship is not explicitly stated in the problem. Typically, such problems involve:
1. Supplementary angles (summing to \( 180^\circ \)).
2. Complementary angles (summing to \( 90^\circ \)).
3. Angles forming a straight line (summing to \( 180^\circ \)).

Given the context and the typical nature of such problems, let's assume that these angles are supplementary (summing to \( 180^\circ \)). This is a reasonable assumption unless otherwise specified.

#### **Step 2: Set up the equation**
If the angles are supplementary, their sum is \( 180^\circ \):
\[
(8y + 2) + (25y - 20) = 180
\]

#### **Step 3: Simplify the equation**
Combine like terms:
\[
8y + 25y + 2 - 20 = 180
\]
\[
33y - 18 = 180
\]

#### **Step 4: Solve for \( y \)**
Add 18 to both sides:
\[
33y = 198
\]

Divide both sides by 33:
\[
y = \frac{198}{33} = 6
\]

#### **Step 5: Verify the solution**
Substitute \( y = 6 \) back into the expressions for the angles:
- Angle at \( A \): \( 8y + 2 = 8(6) + 2 = 48 + 2 = 50^\circ \)
- Angle at \( B \): \( 25y - 20 = 25(6) - 20 = 150 - 20 = 130^\circ \)

Check if they are supplementary:
\[
50^\circ + 130^\circ = 180^\circ
\]
The angles are indeed supplementary, confirming that our solution is correct.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
