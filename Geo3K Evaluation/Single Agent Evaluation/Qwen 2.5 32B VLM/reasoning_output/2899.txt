### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Image and Identify Given Information
- The image shows a circle with center \( W \).
- There are several line segments and right angles marked:
  - \( CW \perp AB \)
  - \( WF \perp ED \)
- It is given that \( CW = WF \).
- It is also given that \( ED = 30 \).

#### Step 2: Understand the Problem
We need to find the length of \( DF \). The key relationships to consider are:
- \( CW = WF \): This implies that \( W \) is equidistant from \( C \) and \( F \).
- \( ED = 30 \): This is the total length of the chord \( ED \).
- The perpendiculars \( CW \) and \( WF \) suggest that \( W \) is the midpoint of the chords \( AB \) and \( ED \), respectively, due to the properties of perpendicular bisectors in circles.

#### Step 3: Use Geometric Properties
1. **Perpendicular Bisector Property**: Since \( WF \perp ED \), \( W \) is the midpoint of the chord \( ED \). This means that \( EF = FD \).
2. **Given Length**: \( ED = 30 \). Since \( W \) is the midpoint, we can split \( ED \) into two equal parts:
   \[
   EF = FD = \frac{ED}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
   \]

#### Step 4: Verify the Relationships
- The condition \( CW = WF \) does not affect the calculation of \( DF \) directly, but it confirms that \( W \) is symmetrically placed relative to the chords.
- The key relationship here is the symmetry and midpoint property of the perpendicular from the center to a chord.

#### Step 5: Conclusion from Analysis
From the above steps, we conclude that \( DF = 15 \).

### Solution Section

Based on the analysis:
1. \( W \) is the midpoint of \( ED \) because \( WF \perp ED \).
2. \( ED = 30 \), so \( DF = \frac{ED}{2} = 15 \).

Thus, the length of \( DF \) is \( 15 \).

Final Answer: **A**
