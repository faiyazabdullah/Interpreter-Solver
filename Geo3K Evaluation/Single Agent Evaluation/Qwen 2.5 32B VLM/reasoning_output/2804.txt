====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given image depicts a parallelogram with the following information:
- One side (base) labeled as \( CD = 21 \) ft.
- Another side (slant height) labeled as \( DA = 17 \) ft.
- The perpendicular height from \( B \) to \( AD \) is given as 8 ft.

We need to find the perimeter of the parallelogram. The perimeter of a parallelogram is given by:
\[
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Base} + \text{Slant Height})
\]
where the base and slant height are the lengths of the sides of the parallelogram.

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Identify the given information
- Base \( CD = 21 \) ft.
- Slant height \( DA = 17 \) ft.
- Perpendicular height from \( B \) to \( AD \) is 8 ft (this is not directly used for perimeter but helps confirm the shape).

#### Step 2: Understand the properties of a parallelogram
In a parallelogram:
- Opposite sides are equal in length.
- Therefore, \( AB = CD = 21 \) ft and \( BC = DA = 17 \) ft.

#### Step 3: Calculate the perimeter
The perimeter of the parallelogram is:
\[
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Base} + \text{Slant Height}) = 2 \times (CD + DA)
\]
Substitute the given values:
\[
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (21 + 17) = 2 \times 38 = 76 \text{ ft}
\]

#### Step 4: Verify the calculation
- The base \( CD = 21 \) ft and the slant height \( DA = 17 \) ft are correctly identified.
- The formula for the perimeter of a parallelogram is correctly applied.
- The result is straightforward and does not require rounding.

#### Step 5: Compare with the answer choices
The calculated perimeter is 76 ft, which matches one of the given answer choices.

### Solution Section:

The perimeter of the parallelogram is:
\[
\boxed{76}
\]
