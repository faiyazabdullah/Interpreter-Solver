### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a parallelogram \(ABCD\) with the following information:
- One side length \(AB = 20 \, \text{cm}\).
- Another side length \(BC = 12 \, \text{cm}\).
- An angle \(\angle ABC = 60^\circ\).
- The height from \(D\) to \(BC\) is labeled but not directly used in finding the perimeter.

The task is to find the **perimeter** of the parallelogram, which is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. Since opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal, the perimeter can be calculated as:
\[
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (AB + BC)
\]

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the given information
- \(AB = 20 \, \text{cm}\) (one side of the parallelogram).
- \(BC = 12 \, \text{cm}\) (adjacent side of the parallelogram).
- \(\angle ABC = 60^\circ\) (angle between the two sides).

#### Step 2: Use the properties of a parallelogram
In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. Therefore:
- \(AB = CD = 20 \, \text{cm}\).
- \(BC = AD = 12 \, \text{cm}\).

#### Step 3: Calculate the perimeter
The perimeter \(P\) of a parallelogram is given by:
\[
P = 2 \times (\text{length of one pair of opposite sides} + \text{length of the other pair of opposite sides})
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
P = 2 \times (AB + BC) = 2 \times (20 + 12) = 2 \times 32 = 64 \, \text{cm}
\]

#### Step 4: Verify the calculation
The formula for the perimeter of a parallelogram is straightforward and does not depend on the angle or height. The given measurements are sufficient to calculate the perimeter accurately.

#### Step 5: Compare with the answer choices
The calculated perimeter is \(64 \, \text{cm}\). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 60
- B. 62
- C. 64
- D. 66

The closest match is **C. 64**.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
