### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a parallelogram \(ABCD\) with the following information:
- One side (base) \(AB = 23 \text{ ft}\).
- The height from vertex \(A\) to the line containing \(AB\) is \(24 \text{ ft}\).
- A dashed vertical line represents the height, and its foot is labeled \(D\), which lies on \(AB\).
- The segment \(AD\) is given as \(7 \text{ ft}\).

We need to find the area of the parallelogram. The formula for the area of a parallelogram is:
\[
\text{Area} = \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
Here, the base is \(AB = 23 \text{ ft}\), and the height is given as \(24 \text{ ft}\).

### Thought Section:
1. **Identify the Base and Height**:
   - The base of the parallelogram is \(AB = 23 \text{ ft}\).
   - The height is the perpendicular distance from vertex \(A\) to the line \(AB\), which is given as \(24 \text{ ft}\).

2. **Verify the Height**:
   - The height is explicitly given as \(24 \text{ ft}\), and it is perpendicular to the base \(AB\). This is consistent with the definition of the height in a parallelogram.

3. **Apply the Area Formula**:
   - The area of a parallelogram is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]
   - Substituting the given values:
     \[
     \text{Area} = 23 \times 24
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - Calculate \(23 \times 24\):
     \[
     23 \times 24 = 23 \times (20 + 4) = (23 \times 20) + (23 \times 4) = 460 + 92 = 552
     \]

5. **Compare with Answer Choices**:
   - The calculated area is \(552 \text{ ft}^2\).
   - The answer choices are:
     - A. 552
     - B. 575
     - C. 598
     - D. 720
   - The calculated area matches option A.

### Solution Section:
The area of the parallelogram is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Area} = \text{base} \times \text{height} = 23 \times 24 = 552 \text{ ft}^2
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
