### Problem Analysis:
The image depicts a parallelogram \(ABCD\) with the following details:
- \(AB = 28\) ft (base of the parallelogram).
- \(BC = 9\) ft (one of the sides of the parallelogram).
- \(\angle ABC = 45^\circ\).
- A perpendicular line is drawn from point \(C\) to side \(AB\), creating a right triangle within the parallelogram.

We need to find the area of the parallelogram. The formula for the area of a parallelogram is:
\[
\text{Area} = \text{Base} \times \text{Height}
\]
Here, the base \(AB = 28\) ft. We need to determine the height of the parallelogram, which is the perpendicular distance from \(C\) to \(AB\).

### Thought Section:
1. **Identify the Given Information:**
   - Base \(AB = 28\) ft.
   - Side \(BC = 9\) ft.
   - Angle \(\angle ABC = 45^\circ\).

2. **Determine the Height:**
   - The height of the parallelogram is the length of the perpendicular dropped from \(C\) to \(AB\). This forms a right triangle with \(BC\) as the hypotenuse and the height as one of the legs.
   - In the right triangle, the height can be found using trigonometry. Specifically, the height is the opposite side to the \(45^\circ\) angle in the right triangle formed by \(BC\), the height, and the adjacent side along \(AB\).
   - Using the sine function:
     \[
     \sin(45^\circ) = \frac{\text{Height}}{BC}
     \]
     Since \(\sin(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\), we have:
     \[
     \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{\text{Height}}{9}
     \]
     Solving for the height:
     \[
     \text{Height} = 9 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{9\sqrt{2}}{2}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Area:**
   - The area of the parallelogram is given by:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Base} \times \text{Height} = 28 \times \frac{9\sqrt{2}}{2}
     \]
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     \text{Area} = 28 \times \frac{9\sqrt{2}}{2} = 14 \times 9\sqrt{2} = 126\sqrt{2}
     \]
   - Approximate \(\sqrt{2}\) as \(1.414\):
     \[
     \text{Area} \approx 126 \times 1.414 = 178.164
     \]
   - Round to the nearest tenth:
     \[
     \text{Area} \approx 178.2
     \]

4. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated area is approximately \(178.2\), which matches choice B.

### Solution Section:
The area of the parallelogram is:
\[
\boxed{178.2}
\]
