### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a parallelogram with the following information:
- One side (base) labeled as \( AC = 12 \) cm.
- Another side (slant height) labeled as \( AB = 13 \) cm.
- The height of the parallelogram (perpendicular distance from \( D \) to \( AC \)) is given as \( 5 \) cm.

We are tasked with finding the **perimeter** of the parallelogram. The perimeter of a parallelogram is the sum of the lengths of its four sides. Since opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal, the perimeter \( P \) can be expressed as:
\[
P = 2 \times (\text{length of one pair of opposite sides}) + 2 \times (\text{length of the other pair of opposite sides})
\]

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Identify the given information**
- Base \( AC = 12 \) cm.
- Slant height \( AB = 13 \) cm.
- Height (perpendicular distance from \( D \) to \( AC \)) = 5 cm.

#### **Step 2: Use the properties of a parallelogram**
In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. Therefore:
- \( AC = BD = 12 \) cm.
- \( AB = CD = 13 \) cm.

#### **Step 3: Calculate the perimeter**
The perimeter \( P \) of the parallelogram is given by:
\[
P = 2 \times (AC + AB)
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
P = 2 \times (12 + 13) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ cm}
\]

#### **Step 4: Verify the calculations**
- The base \( AC \) is 12 cm, and the slant height \( AB \) is 13 cm.
- Opposite sides are equal, so the total perimeter is correctly calculated as \( 50 \) cm.

#### **Step 5: Compare with the answer choices**
The calculated perimeter is \( 50 \) cm. Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 25
- B. 50
- C. 60
- D. 100

The correct answer is \( 50 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
