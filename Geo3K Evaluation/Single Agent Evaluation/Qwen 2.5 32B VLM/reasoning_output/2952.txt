### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the given information
- The figure shows a trapezoid \(QRST\) with \(QR \parallel ST\).
- \(A\) and \(B\) are midpoints of the non-parallel sides (legs) \(QT\) and \(SR\), respectively.
- The length of \(ST = 12\).
- The length of \(QR = 20\).
- The angle at vertex \(A\) (\(\angle TQA\)) is \(120^\circ\).
- The angle at vertex \(B\) (\(\angle SBR\)) is \(45^\circ\).

#### Step 2: Understand the problem
We need to find the measure of \(\angle S\). Since \(A\) and \(B\) are midpoints of the legs, the segment \(AB\) is the **midsegment** (or **median**) of the trapezoid. The midsegment of a trapezoid is parallel to the bases and its length is the average of the lengths of the two bases:
\[
AB = \frac{ST + QR}{2} = \frac{12 + 20}{2} = 16.
\]

#### Step 3: Use geometric properties
Since \(AB\) is parallel to both \(ST\) and \(QR\), we can use the properties of parallel lines and transversals to relate the angles. Specifically:
- \(\angle TQA = 120^\circ\) implies that \(\angle TQA\) is an exterior angle to \(\triangle TQA\).
- \(\angle SBR = 45^\circ\) implies that \(\angle SBR\) is an exterior angle to \(\triangle SBR\).

#### Step 4: Relate angles in the trapezoid
In trapezoid \(QRST\):
- Since \(AB\) is parallel to \(ST\) and \(QR\), the angles formed by the transversals \(QT\) and \(SR\) with \(AB\) are corresponding or alternate interior angles.
- The angle \(\angle S\) is part of the trapezoid and can be determined by considering the internal angles and the given external angles.

#### Step 5: Use the sum of interior angles in a trapezoid
The sum of the interior angles of a trapezoid is \(360^\circ\). However, we can focus on the specific angles around vertices \(T\) and \(S\):
- At vertex \(T\), the angle \(\angle T\) is related to \(\angle TQA = 120^\circ\).
- At vertex \(S\), the angle \(\angle S\) is related to \(\angle SBR = 45^\circ\).

#### Step 6: Determine \(\angle S\)
Since \(A\) and \(B\) are midpoints, the segment \(AB\) divides the trapezoid into two smaller trapezoids with similar angle properties. The angle \(\angle S\) is directly related to the given external angle \(\angle SBR = 45^\circ\). By the properties of trapezoids and parallel lines:
\[
\angle S = 180^\circ - \angle SBR = 180^\circ - 45^\circ = 135^\circ.
\]

### Solution Section

Based on the analysis:
- The angle \(\angle S\) is determined by the relationship between the external angle \(\angle SBR\) and the internal angle at vertex \(S\).
- Using the property that the internal angle is supplementary to the external angle, we find:
\[
\angle S = 180^\circ - 45^\circ = 135^\circ.
\]

Thus, the measure of \(\angle S\) is \(135^\circ\).

Final Answer: \boxed{D}
