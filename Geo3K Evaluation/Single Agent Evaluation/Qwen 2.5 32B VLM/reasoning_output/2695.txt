### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a circle with several labeled points and angles. We need to find the measure of the arc \( \widehat{LP} \). Here's a breakdown of the given information:
- \( \angle MNL = 36^\circ \)
- \( \angle LNP = 78^\circ \)
- The lines \( MN \) and \( LP \) are tangents to the circle at points \( N \) and \( P \), respectively.
- The red dots indicate right angles, meaning \( MN \perp NL \) and \( LP \perp NP \).

### Objective:
We need to determine the measure of the arc \( \widehat{LP} \).

---

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Understand the Geometry
1. **Tangents and Right Angles**: Since \( MN \) and \( LP \) are tangents to the circle at points \( N \) and \( P \), respectively, the radii drawn to these points (e.g., \( ON \) and \( OP \)) will be perpendicular to the tangents. This confirms the right angles at \( N \) and \( P \).
2. **Central Angles and Arcs**: The measure of an arc is twice the measure of the inscribed angle that subtends it. However, since we are dealing with tangents and the given angles are exterior to the circle, we need to use properties of tangents and the circle.

#### Step 2: Use the Given Angles
- The angle \( \angle MNL = 36^\circ \) is formed by the tangent \( MN \) and the line segment \( NL \).
- The angle \( \angle LNP = 78^\circ \) is formed by the tangent \( LP \) and the line segment \( NP \).

#### Step 3: Relate Angles to the Circle
The key to solving this problem lies in understanding how these angles relate to the circle. Specifically:
- The angle between a tangent and a chord through the point of contact is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. However, here we are dealing with the exterior angles formed by tangents.
- The sum of the angles around point \( N \) (where the tangents meet) is important. Since \( MN \) and \( LP \) are tangents, the angles they form with the radius at the point of tangency are right angles.

#### Step 4: Calculate the Central Angle
To find the measure of the arc \( \widehat{LP} \), we need to determine the central angle subtended by \( LP \). The central angle can be found using the fact that the sum of the angles around point \( N \) is \( 360^\circ \).

1. The angle \( \angle MNL = 36^\circ \) is part of the exterior angle at \( N \).
2. The angle \( \angle LNP = 78^\circ \) is another part of the exterior angle at \( N \).
3. Since \( MN \) and \( LP \) are tangents, the angles they form with the radii at \( N \) and \( P \) are right angles. Therefore, the remaining angles around the circle can be used to find the central angle.

#### Step 5: Use the Inscribed Angle Theorem
The measure of the arc \( \widehat{LP} \) is twice the measure of the inscribed angle that subtends it. However, since we are dealing with tangents, we need to use the fact that the angle between a tangent and a chord is equal to the angle in the alternate segment.

#### Step 6: Calculate the Arc Measure
The measure of the arc \( \widehat{LP} \) can be found by considering the total angle around the circle and subtracting the given angles. Specifically:
- The total angle around the circle is \( 360^\circ \).
- The angles \( \angle MNL \) and \( \angle LNP \) are exterior angles that help us determine the central angle subtended by \( \widehat{LP} \).

Using the property that the angle between a tangent and a chord is equal to the angle in the alternate segment, we can deduce:
\[ \text{Measure of } \widehat{LP} = 360^\circ - 2 \times (\text{Sum of the given angles}) \]

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the measure of the arc \( \widehat{LP} \) is directly related to the angle \( \angle LNP \):
\[ \text{Measure of } \widehat{LP} = 2 \times \angle LNP = 2 \times 78^\circ = 156^\circ \]

---

### Solution Section:

Based on the analysis:
- The measure of the arc \( \widehat{LP} \) is \( 156^\circ \).

Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 114
- B. 144
- C. 150
- D. 156

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{D} \]
