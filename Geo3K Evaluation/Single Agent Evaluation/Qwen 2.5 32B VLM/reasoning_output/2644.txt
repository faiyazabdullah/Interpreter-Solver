### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a geometric figure with several key features:
1. **Triangle \(ABCD\)**: It appears to be a quadrilateral divided into triangles.
2. **Right Angles**: There are right angles marked at points \(A\) and \(D\), indicating that \(\angle BAD = 90^\circ\) and \(\angle ADC = 90^\circ\).
3. **Parallel Lines**: The parallel line markings indicate that \(AB \parallel CD\) and \(AD \parallel BC\), suggesting that \(ABCD\) is a rectangle.
4. **Lengths**: The lengths \(DE = 5\) and \(BE = 12\) are given, where \(E\) is the intersection point of the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\).

The goal is to find the length of \(BC\).

---

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Identify the Shape
- The presence of right angles at \(A\) and \(D\) and the parallel lines suggest that \(ABCD\) is a rectangle.
- In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other.

#### Step 2: Use the Properties of a Rectangle
- In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal in length and bisect each other.
- Let the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at point \(E\). Since \(E\) is the midpoint of both diagonals, \(AE = EC\) and \(BE = ED\).

#### Step 3: Analyze the Given Information
- We are given \(DE = 5\) and \(BE = 12\).
- Since \(E\) is the midpoint of the diagonals, \(BE = ED\). However, the problem states \(DE = 5\) and \(BE = 12\), which suggests that \(E\) is not necessarily the midpoint but rather a division point along the diagonals.

#### Step 4: Use the Pythagorean Theorem
- Consider triangle \(BDE\). Since \(\angle BAD = 90^\circ\) and \(\angle ADC = 90^\circ\), the diagonals of the rectangle form right triangles when split.
- In triangle \(BDE\), \(BD\) is the hypotenuse, and we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
  \[
  BD^2 = BE^2 + DE^2
  \]
  Substituting the given values:
  \[
  BD^2 = 12^2 + 5^2 = 144 + 25 = 169
  \]
  Therefore:
  \[
  BD = \sqrt{169} = 13
  \]

#### Step 5: Relate \(BD\) to \(BC\)
- In a rectangle, the diagonal \(BD\) is related to the sides \(AB\) and \(BC\) by the Pythagorean theorem:
  \[
  BD^2 = AB^2 + BC^2
  \]
- However, since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, the length of \(BC\) is equal to the length of \(AD\), and the length of \(AB\) is equal to the length of \(DC\).
- Given that \(BD = 13\) and the properties of the rectangle, we can conclude that \(BC\) is one of the sides of the rectangle.

#### Step 6: Determine \(BC\)
- The length of \(BC\) can be directly inferred from the properties of the rectangle and the given information. Since \(BD = 13\) and the diagonals of a rectangle are equal, the side lengths must satisfy the Pythagorean relationship.
- Given the options, the length of \(BC\) must be a value that fits the context of the problem. Since \(BD = 13\) is the hypotenuse, and the sides of the rectangle are integers, the most logical choice is \(BC = 12\).

---

### Solution Section:

Based on the analysis:
- The length of \(BD\) is 13, which is the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the sides of the rectangle.
- The side lengths of the rectangle must satisfy the Pythagorean theorem, and the most logical choice for \(BC\) is 12.

Thus, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
