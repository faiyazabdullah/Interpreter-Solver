### Problem Analysis:
We are given a quadrilateral \(ABDC\) which is a rectangle. The key points and information provided in the image and problem are:
1. Quadrilateral \(ABDC\) is a rectangle.
2. \( \angle 1 = 38^\circ \).
3. We need to find \( \angle 2 \).

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the properties of a rectangle**:
   - All interior angles of a rectangle are right angles (\(90^\circ\)).
   - Opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.

2. **Analyze the given angle \( \angle 1 \)**:
   - \( \angle 1 \) is labeled at point \(A\) and appears to be formed by the diagonal \(AC\) and side \(AB\).
   - Since \(ABDC\) is a rectangle, \(AB \perp AD\). Therefore, \( \angle BAD = 90^\circ \).

3. **Determine the relationship between \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 2 \)**:
   - \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 2 \) are adjacent angles formed by the intersection of the diagonal \(AC\) with side \(AB\).
   - In a rectangle, the diagonals bisect each other and are equal in length. However, this property is not directly needed here.
   - Since \(AB \perp AD\), the sum of \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 2 \) must equal \(90^\circ\):
     \[
     \angle 1 + \angle 2 = 90^\circ
     \]

4. **Substitute the given value of \( \angle 1 \)**:
   - Given \( \angle 1 = 38^\circ \):
     \[
     38^\circ + \angle 2 = 90^\circ
     \]

5. **Solve for \( \angle 2 \)**:
   \[
   \angle 2 = 90^\circ - 38^\circ = 52^\circ
   \]

### Final Answer:
The measure of \( \angle 2 \) is \(52^\circ\).

\[
\boxed{C}
\]
