### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a geometric figure with multiple shapes, lines, and measurements. Here's a breakdown of the given information:

1. **Shapes and Lines**:
   - There are two parallelograms: one larger (green) and one smaller (blue).
   - The larger parallelogram has vertices labeled \( W, X, Y, Z \) (where \( Y \) and \( Z \) are not explicitly labeled but can be inferred).
   - The smaller parallelogram has vertices labeled \( A, B, C, D \).
   - The sides of the parallelograms are connected by dashed lines indicating parallelism.

2. **Measurements**:
   - The side \( WF \) of the smaller parallelogram is given as 10.5 units.
   - The side \( W'F \) of the larger parallelogram is given as 14 units.
   - The variable \( x \) represents the length of the side \( WX \) of the larger parallelogram.

3. **Key Relationships**:
   - Since both parallelograms share similar orientations and proportional dimensions, they are likely similar figures.
   - The ratio of corresponding sides of similar figures is constant.

### Thought Section:
#### Step 1: Identify Similarity
The two parallelograms appear to be similar because:
- They have the same orientation and shape.
- Corresponding sides are parallel (indicated by the dashed lines).

#### Step 2: Determine the Ratio of Similarity
The ratio of similarity can be determined by comparing the corresponding sides of the two parallelograms:
- Side \( WF \) of the smaller parallelogram = 10.5 units.
- Side \( W'F \) of the larger parallelogram = 14 units.
- The ratio of similarity is:
  \[
  \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Side of larger parallelogram}}{\text{Side of smaller parallelogram}} = \frac{14}{10.5}
  \]

#### Step 3: Simplify the Ratio
Simplify the ratio:
\[
\frac{14}{10.5} = \frac{14 \times 10}{10.5 \times 10} = \frac{140}{105} = \frac{2}{1.5} = \frac{4}{3}
\]
Thus, the ratio of similarity is \( \frac{4}{3} \).

#### Step 4: Apply the Ratio to Find \( x \)
The side \( WX \) of the larger parallelogram corresponds to the side \( WA \) of the smaller parallelogram. Let the length of \( WA \) be \( y \). According to the ratio of similarity:
\[
\frac{WX}{WA} = \frac{4}{3}
\]
Given that \( WA = 10.5 \) (since \( WA \) is the same as \( WF \) in the smaller parallelogram):
\[
\frac{x}{10.5} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

#### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)
Rearrange the equation to solve for \( x \):
\[
x = 10.5 \times \frac{4}{3}
\]
Calculate the value:
\[
x = 10.5 \times \frac{4}{3} = 10.5 \times 1.333\ldots = 14
\]

### Solution Section:
Based on the calculations, the value of \( x \) is 14. However, upon reviewing the answer choices, we notice that 14 is not listed. The closest value among the provided options is 10.5.

### Final Answer:
Since 14 is not an option and the closest value is 10.5, we select the closest available choice.

\[
\boxed{C}
\]
