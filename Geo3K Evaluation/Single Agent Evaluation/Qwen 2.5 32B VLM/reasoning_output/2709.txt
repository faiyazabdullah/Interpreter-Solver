### Problem Analysis:
We are given the following information:
- Circle \( J \) has a radius of 10 units.
- Circle \( K \) has a radius of 8 units.
- The length of segment \( BC \) is 5.4 units.
- We need to find the length of segment \( CK \).

From the diagram, we observe:
- Circle \( J \) is centered at point \( J \), and circle \( K \) is centered at point \( K \).
- Point \( B \) lies on both circles, so it is the intersection of the two circles.
- Segment \( BC \) is part of the larger circle (circle \( J \)).
- Segment \( CK \) is a radius of circle \( K \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**
- Circle \( J \) has a radius of 10 units, so \( JB = 10 \).
- Circle \( K \) has a radius of 8 units, so \( KB = 8 \).
- The length of \( BC \) is given as 5.4 units.
- We need to find the length of \( CK \), which is a radius of circle \( K \). Since \( K \) is the center of circle \( K \), \( CK = 8 \) units.

#### **Step 2: Verify the Length of \( CK \)**
- The problem asks for the length of \( CK \), but it is directly given by the radius of circle \( K \).
- The radius of circle \( K \) is 8 units, so \( CK = 8 \).

#### **Step 3: Check for Any Misinterpretations**
- The problem does not require us to calculate anything beyond the radius of circle \( K \).
- The length of \( BC \) is irrelevant to finding \( CK \) since \( CK \) is simply the radius of circle \( K \).

#### **Step 4: Match the Answer with the Choices**
- The length of \( CK \) is 8 units.
- However, the answer choices provided are:
  - A. 2.4
  - B. 2.6
  - C. 2.8
  - D. 4

Since 8 is not among the choices, we need to re-evaluate the problem statement and the diagram. Upon closer inspection, it appears there might be a misunderstanding in the problem setup or the interpretation of the question. However, based on the given information and standard geometric principles, \( CK \) should indeed be 8 units.

#### **Step 5: Select the Closest Choice**
- Since 8 is not an option, we choose the closest value among the given choices. The closest value to 8 is 4 (option D).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
