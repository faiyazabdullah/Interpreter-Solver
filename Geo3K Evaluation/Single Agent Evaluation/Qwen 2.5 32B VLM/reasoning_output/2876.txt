### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the perimeter of \( \triangle DEF \), given that \( \triangle DEF \sim \triangle CBF \). The key pieces of information provided are:
1. The perimeter of \( \triangle CBF \) is 27.
2. \( DF = 6 \).
3. \( FC = 8 \).

Since \( \triangle DEF \sim \triangle CBF \), the triangles are similar, meaning their corresponding sides are proportional, and their perimeters are also proportional by the same ratio.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Similarity Ratio**
From the similarity of \( \triangle DEF \) and \( \triangle CBF \), the ratio of the corresponding sides is the same. Specifically, the ratio of the sides \( DF \) and \( FC \) gives us the similarity ratio:
\[
\text{Similarity Ratio} = \frac{DF}{FC} = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4}.
\]

This means that every side of \( \triangle DEF \) is \( \frac{3}{4} \) the length of the corresponding side in \( \triangle CBF \).

#### **Step 2: Perimeter Proportionality**
Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of their perimeters is equal to the similarity ratio. Let \( P_{DEF} \) be the perimeter of \( \triangle DEF \) and \( P_{CBF} \) be the perimeter of \( \triangle CBF \). We know:
\[
P_{CBF} = 27.
\]
The similarity ratio tells us:
\[
\frac{P_{DEF}}{P_{CBF}} = \frac{3}{4}.
\]
Substituting the known value of \( P_{CBF} \):
\[
\frac{P_{DEF}}{27} = \frac{3}{4}.
\]

#### **Step 3: Solve for \( P_{DEF} \)**
To find \( P_{DEF} \), we solve the equation:
\[
P_{DEF} = 27 \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{81}{4} = 20.25.
\]

#### **Step 4: Verify the Calculation**
The calculation is straightforward and consistent with the properties of similar triangles. The perimeter of \( \triangle DEF \) is indeed \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the perimeter of \( \triangle CBF \).

### Final Answer:
The perimeter of \( \triangle DEF \) is \( 20.25 \).

\[
\boxed{A}
\]
