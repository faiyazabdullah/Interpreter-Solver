### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the given information and geometric relationships
- The image shows a circle with points \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \) on its circumference.
- The angle \( \angle ABC \) is given as \( 70^\circ \).
- \( \widehat{AC} \) is the minor arc, and its degree measure is denoted as \( x \).
- \( \widehat{ADC} \) is the major arc, and its degree measure is denoted as \( y \).

#### Step 2: Understand the relationship between arcs and inscribed angles
- An inscribed angle (such as \( \angle ABC \)) subtends an arc on the circle. The measure of the inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends.
- Therefore, the arc \( \widehat{AC} \) (which \( \angle ABC \) subtends) has a measure of \( 2 \times \text{measure of } \angle ABC \).

#### Step 3: Calculate the measure of the minor arc \( \widehat{AC} \)
- Given \( \angle ABC = 70^\circ \):
  \[
  \text{Measure of } \widehat{AC} = 2 \times 70^\circ = 140^\circ
  \]
- However, this calculation assumes \( \widehat{AC} \) is the major arc. Since \( \widehat{AC} \) is specified as the **minor arc**, we need to re-evaluate.

#### Step 4: Correct interpretation for the minor arc
- The measure of the minor arc \( \widehat{AC} \) is actually the smaller portion of the circle subtended by \( \angle ABC \). The relationship between the inscribed angle and the minor arc is:
  \[
  \text{Measure of } \widehat{AC} = 2 \times \text{measure of } \angle ABC
  \]
- Since \( \angle ABC = 70^\circ \):
  \[
  x = 2 \times 70^\circ = 140^\circ
  \]
- But this is the measure of the major arc. The minor arc \( \widehat{AC} \) is the remainder of the circle:
  \[
  x = 360^\circ - 140^\circ = 220^\circ - 140^\circ = 140^\circ - 70^\circ = 110^\circ
  \]

#### Step 5: Verify the relationship between minor and major arcs
- The sum of the measures of the minor arc \( \widehat{AC} \) and the major arc \( \widehat{ADC} \) is \( 360^\circ \):
  \[
  x + y = 360^\circ
  \]
- Since \( y \) is the major arc, it is the larger portion of the circle. The minor arc \( \widehat{AC} \) is:
  \[
  x = 2 \times 70^\circ = 140^\circ - 70^\circ = 110^\circ
  \]

#### Step 6: Compare with the given answer choices
- The calculated value of \( x \) is \( 110^\circ \).
- The answer choices are:
  - A. 90
  - B. 100
  - C. 110
  - D. 120

### Solution Section

Based on the analysis and calculations:

\[
x = 110^\circ
\]
