### Problem Analysis:
The given problem involves finding the measure of angle \( \angle 6 \) in a geometric figure. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

#### Step 1: Identify Given Information
- \( m\angle 4 = 101^\circ \)
- The figure shows intersecting lines forming several angles labeled \( \angle 1, \angle 2, \angle 3, \angle 4, \angle 5, \angle 6, \angle 7, \angle 8 \).

#### Step 2: Understand Relationships Between Angles
From the image, we observe the following relationships:
1. **Vertical Angles**: Vertical angles are equal. For example:
   - \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 6 \) are vertical angles.
   - \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 5 \) are vertical angles.
   - \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 7 \) are vertical angles.
   - \( \angle 2 \) and \( \angle 8 \) are vertical angles.

2. **Supplementary Angles**: Adjacent angles formed by intersecting lines are supplementary (sum to \( 180^\circ \)). For example:
   - \( \angle 4 + \angle 5 = 180^\circ \)
   - \( \angle 3 + \angle 4 = 180^\circ \)
   - \( \angle 1 + \angle 2 = 180^\circ \)
   - \( \angle 7 + \angle 8 = 180^\circ \)

#### Step 3: Use the Property of Vertical Angles
Since \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 6 \) are vertical angles, they are equal:
\[ m\angle 6 = m\angle 4 \]

Given \( m\angle 4 = 101^\circ \), it follows that:
\[ m\angle 6 = 101^\circ \]

#### Step 4: Verify the Calculation
- The property of vertical angles states that vertical angles are always equal.
- No additional information or calculations are needed since the relationship between \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 6 \) is directly given by their vertical angle property.

#### Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated measure of \( \angle 6 \) is \( 101^\circ \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 69
- B. 79
- C. 89
- D. 101

The correct answer is \( D \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
