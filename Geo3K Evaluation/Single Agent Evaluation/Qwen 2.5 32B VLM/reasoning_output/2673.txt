### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the length of \( TV \) in the circle \(\odot R\). The image provides the following information:
1. \( RS = 6 \) (radius of the circle).
2. \( US = 5 \) (length of a segment within the circle).
3. \( TS \perp UV \) (indicating that \( TS \) is perpendicular to \( UV \)).
4. \( T \) and \( V \) are points on the circumference of the circle, and \( S \) is the center of the circle.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understanding the Geometry**
- Since \( S \) is the center of the circle, \( RS \) is the radius, and its length is 6.
- \( TS \perp UV \) implies that \( TS \) is the perpendicular bisector of \( UV \). Therefore, \( U \) and \( V \) are symmetric with respect to \( TS \), and \( UV \) is a chord of the circle.
- The length \( US \) is given as 5, which is part of the radius.

#### **Step 2: Using the Pythagorean Theorem**
- Consider the right triangle \( TUS \):
  - \( TS \) is one leg of the right triangle.
  - \( US \) is another leg of the right triangle, with length 5.
  - \( TU \) is the hypotenuse, which is equal to the radius of the circle, 6.

Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle TUS \):
\[
TU^2 = TS^2 + US^2
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
6^2 = TS^2 + 5^2
\]
\[
36 = TS^2 + 25
\]
\[
TS^2 = 11
\]
\[
TS = \sqrt{11}
\]

#### **Step 3: Finding the Length of \( TV \)**
- Since \( TS \perp UV \), \( TS \) is the perpendicular bisector of \( UV \). This means \( UV \) is twice the length of the segment from \( S \) to the midpoint of \( UV \).
- The length \( TV \) is the diameter of the circle minus the segment \( US \) and the segment \( SV \).

However, a simpler approach is to recognize that \( TV \) is the diameter of the circle because \( T \) and \( V \) are endpoints of the diameter passing through \( S \). The diameter is twice the radius:
\[
TV = 2 \times RS = 2 \times 6 = 12
\]

#### **Step 4: Verifying the Calculation**
- The diameter of the circle is indeed 12, as it is twice the radius.
- No further adjustments are needed since the problem asks for \( TV \), which is directly the diameter.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
