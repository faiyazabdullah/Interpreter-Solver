### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a circle with a radius marked as 4 inches. The center of the circle is labeled as point \( A \), and a point on the circumference is labeled as \( B \). The line segment \( AB \) is a radius of the circle, and its length is given as 4 inches. The task is to find the area of the circle.

### Thought Section:
1. **Identify the Shape and Given Information**:
   - The figure is a circle.
   - The radius \( r \) of the circle is given as 4 inches.

2. **Understand What Needs to Be Found**:
   - We need to calculate the area of the circle.

3. **Relevant Geometric Formula**:
   - The formula for the area of a circle is:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \pi r^2
     \]
   - Here, \( r \) is the radius of the circle.

4. **Substitute the Given Value**:
   - The radius \( r = 4 \) inches.
   - Substitute \( r = 4 \) into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \pi (4)^2 = \pi \cdot 16
     \]

5. **Calculate the Area**:
   - Use the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
     \[
     \text{Area} = 3.14159 \cdot 16 \approx 50.26544
     \]

6. **Round to the Nearest Tenth**:
   - Round 50.26544 to the nearest tenth:
     \[
     50.26544 \approx 50.3
     \]

7. **Compare with Answer Choices**:
   - The calculated area is approximately 50.3.
   - The closest answer choice to 50.3 is \( D. 50.2 \).

### Solution Section:
1. **Formula for the Area of a Circle**:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \pi r^2
   \]

2. **Substitute the Radius**:
   \[
   r = 4 \implies \text{Area} = \pi (4)^2 = \pi \cdot 16
   \]

3. **Calculate Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \)**:
   \[
   \text{Area} = 3.14159 \cdot 16 \approx 50.26544
   \]

4. **Round to the Nearest Tenth**:
   \[
   50.26544 \approx 50.3
   \]

5. **Select the Closest Answer Choice**:
   - The closest choice to 50.3 is \( D. 50.2 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
