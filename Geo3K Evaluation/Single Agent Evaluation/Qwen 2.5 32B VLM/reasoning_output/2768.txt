### Problem Analysis:
The problem provides a geometric figure with labeled angles and lines. We are tasked with finding the measure of angle 4, given that \( m\angle 1 = 50^\circ \) and \( m\angle 3 = 60^\circ \). The figure contains parallel lines and transversals, which suggests we will use properties of parallel lines and the relationships between angles formed by transversals.

#### Key Observations from the Image:
1. **Parallel Lines**: The lines labeled \( j \), \( k \), and \( l \) appear to be parallel.
2. **Transversals**: Several lines intersect these parallel lines, creating corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and supplementary angles.
3. **Given Angles**:
   - \( m\angle 1 = 50^\circ \)
   - \( m\angle 3 = 60^\circ \)
4. **Angle Relationships**: We need to use properties such as corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and the fact that angles on a straight line sum to \( 180^\circ \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify Relationships Between Angles
- **Angle 1**: \( m\angle 1 = 50^\circ \). This angle is formed by the transversal \( q \) intersecting the parallel lines \( j \) and \( k \).
- **Angle 3**: \( m\angle 3 = 60^\circ \). This angle is formed by the transversal \( q \) intersecting the parallel lines \( k \) and \( l \).

#### Step 2: Use Parallel Line Properties
Since \( j \parallel k \parallel l \), we can use the following properties:
- **Corresponding Angles**: Angles in the same relative position at each intersection are equal.
- **Alternate Interior Angles**: Angles on opposite sides of the transversal but inside the parallel lines are equal.
- **Supplementary Angles**: Angles on a straight line sum to \( 180^\circ \).

#### Step 3: Determine \( m\angle 4 \)
- **Focus on Angle 4**: Angle 4 is located at the intersection of the transversal \( q \) with the parallel line \( k \). It is directly related to angle 3 because they are consecutive interior angles (also known as same-side interior angles) on the same side of the transversal.

- **Consecutive Interior Angles Theorem**: When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, the consecutive interior angles are supplementary. That is, their measures add up to \( 180^\circ \).
  \[
  m\angle 3 + m\angle 4 = 180^\circ
  \]

- **Substitute the Given Value**:
  \[
  m\angle 3 = 60^\circ
  \]
  \[
  60^\circ + m\angle 4 = 180^\circ
  \]

- **Solve for \( m\angle 4 \)**:
  \[
  m\angle 4 = 180^\circ - 60^\circ = 120^\circ
  \]

However, upon re-examining the figure, it appears that angle 4 is actually an alternate interior angle to another angle formed by the transversal and the parallel lines. Let's re-evaluate the relationship:

- **Re-evaluate Angle 4**: Angle 4 is actually an alternate interior angle to another angle formed by the transversal and the parallel lines. Since angle 4 is part of a triangle formed by the transversal and the parallel lines, we need to consider the triangle's angle sum property.

#### Step 4: Correct Approach Using Triangle Properties
- **Triangle Formation**: Angles 1, 4, and another angle form a triangle. The sum of the angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \).
- **Angle 1**: \( m\angle 1 = 50^\circ \)
- **Angle 3**: \( m\angle 3 = 60^\circ \) (This is not directly part of the triangle but helps in understanding the overall configuration.)

- **Sum of Angles in a Triangle**:
  \[
  m\angle 1 + m\angle 4 + \text{another angle} = 180^\circ
  \]

- **Another Angle**: The third angle in the triangle is supplementary to angle 3 because it is on a straight line with angle 3.
  \[
  180^\circ - 60^\circ = 120^\circ
  \]

- **Sum of Angles in the Triangle**:
  \[
  50^\circ + m\angle 4 + 120^\circ = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  m\angle 4 = 180^\circ - 50^\circ - 120^\circ = 10^\circ
  \]

Upon re-evaluation, the correct approach is to use the supplementary angle property directly:

\[
m\angle 4 = 180^\circ - 60^\circ = 120^\circ
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
