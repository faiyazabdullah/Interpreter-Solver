### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the perimeter of triangle \( \triangle WZX \), given that it is similar to triangle \( \triangle SRT \). The key information provided includes:
- \( \triangle WZX \sim \triangle SRT \)
- \( ST = 6 \) (a side of \( \triangle SRT \))
- \( WX = 5 \) (the corresponding side in \( \triangle WZX \))
- The perimeter of \( \triangle SRT = 15 \)

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand Similarity**
Since \( \triangle WZX \sim \triangle SRT \), the triangles are similar by definition. This means:
1. Corresponding angles are equal.
2. Corresponding sides are proportional.

#### **Step 2: Determine the Scale Factor**
The scale factor between the two triangles can be determined by the ratio of the corresponding sides. Here, the side \( WX \) in \( \triangle WZX \) corresponds to the side \( ST \) in \( \triangle SRT \):
\[
\text{Scale Factor} = \frac{\text{Side in } \triangle WZX}{\text{Corresponding Side in } \triangle SRT} = \frac{WX}{ST} = \frac{5}{6}
\]

#### **Step 3: Relate Perimeters Using the Scale Factor**
For similar triangles, the ratio of their perimeters is equal to the scale factor. Let \( P_{WZX} \) be the perimeter of \( \triangle WZX \) and \( P_{SRT} \) be the perimeter of \( \triangle SRT \). We know:
\[
\frac{P_{WZX}}{P_{SRT}} = \text{Scale Factor} = \frac{5}{6}
\]
Given \( P_{SRT} = 15 \), we can substitute this value into the equation:
\[
\frac{P_{WZX}}{15} = \frac{5}{6}
\]

#### **Step 4: Solve for \( P_{WZX} \)**
To find \( P_{WZX} \), multiply both sides of the equation by 15:
\[
P_{WZX} = 15 \times \frac{5}{6} = \frac{75}{6} = 12.5
\]

#### **Step 5: Verify the Result**
The perimeter of \( \triangle WZX \) is directly proportional to the perimeter of \( \triangle SRT \) by the scale factor \( \frac{5}{6} \). Our calculation confirms that the perimeter of \( \triangle WZX \) is \( 12.5 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
