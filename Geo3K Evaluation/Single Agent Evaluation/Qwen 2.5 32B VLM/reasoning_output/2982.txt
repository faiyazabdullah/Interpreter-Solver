### Problem Analysis:
We are given a geometric figure with two intersecting lines, \( \overrightarrow{a} \) and \( \overrightarrow{b} \), and several labeled angles. The problem states that \( m\angle 4 = 42^\circ \) and asks us to find \( m\angle 7 \).

#### Step 1: Identify Key Information
- \( m\angle 4 = 42^\circ \)
- Angles are labeled as \( \angle 1, \angle 2, \angle 3, \angle 4, \angle 5, \angle 6, \angle 7, \angle 8 \).
- The lines \( \overrightarrow{a} \) and \( \overrightarrow{b} \) intersect at point \( D \), creating vertical angles and linear pairs.

#### Step 2: Understand Angle Relationships
1. **Vertical Angles**: Vertical angles are congruent. For example:
   - \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 3 \) are vertical angles.
   - \( \angle 2 \) and \( \angle 4 \) are vertical angles.
   - \( \angle 5 \) and \( \angle 7 \) are vertical angles.
   - \( \angle 6 \) and \( \angle 8 \) are vertical angles.

2. **Linear Pairs**: Adjacent angles forming a straight line sum to \( 180^\circ \). For example:
   - \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 2 \) form a linear pair.
   - \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 4 \) form a linear pair.
   - \( \angle 5 \) and \( \angle 6 \) form a linear pair.
   - \( \angle 7 \) and \( \angle 8 \) form a linear pair.

#### Step 3: Use Given Information
We know:
- \( m\angle 4 = 42^\circ \).

Since \( \angle 2 \) and \( \angle 4 \) are vertical angles, they are congruent:
\[ m\angle 2 = m\angle 4 = 42^\circ. \]

#### Step 4: Find \( m\angle 7 \)
To find \( m\angle 7 \), we need to use the relationship between \( \angle 7 \) and its adjacent angles. Notice that \( \angle 7 \) is part of a linear pair with \( \angle 6 \):
\[ m\angle 7 + m\angle 6 = 180^\circ. \]

However, we do not have \( m\angle 6 \) directly. Instead, we can use the fact that \( \angle 6 \) is vertically opposite to \( \angle 4 \). Since \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 6 \) are supplementary to their adjacent angles in the linear pair:
\[ m\angle 6 = 180^\circ - m\angle 5. \]

But more directly, since \( \angle 7 \) is vertically opposite to \( \angle 5 \), and \( \angle 5 \) is supplementary to \( \angle 4 \):
\[ m\angle 5 = 180^\circ - m\angle 4 = 180^\circ - 42^\circ = 138^\circ. \]

Thus, \( m\angle 7 = m\angle 5 = 138^\circ \).

### Solution:
By the properties of vertical angles and linear pairs, we have:
\[ m\angle 7 = 138^\circ. \]

### Final Answer:
\[ \boxed{D} \]
