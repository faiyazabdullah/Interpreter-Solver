### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a circle with a central angle of \(240^\circ\) and a radius of \(6 \, \text{mm}\). The shaded region is a sector of the circle. To find the area of the shaded region, we need to calculate the area of the sector formed by the central angle \(240^\circ\).

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Identify Given Information
- Central angle: \(240^\circ\)
- Radius of the circle: \(6 \, \text{mm}\)
- The shaded region is a sector of the circle.

#### Step 2: Recall the Formula for the Area of a Sector
The area \(A\) of a sector of a circle with radius \(r\) and central angle \(\theta\) (in degrees) is given by:
\[
A = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi r^2
\]
Here:
- \(\theta = 240^\circ\)
- \(r = 6 \, \text{mm}\)

#### Step 3: Substitute the Given Values into the Formula
First, calculate the fraction of the circle covered by the sector:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} = \frac{240^\circ}{360^\circ} = \frac{2}{3}
\]
Next, substitute \(r = 6 \, \text{mm}\) and \(\pi \approx 3.14159\) into the formula:
\[
A = \frac{2}{3} \times \pi \times (6)^2
\]

#### Step 4: Simplify the Expression
Calculate the square of the radius:
\[
6^2 = 36
\]
Now multiply by \(\pi\):
\[
\pi \times 36 \approx 3.14159 \times 36 = 113.097
\]
Then multiply by \(\frac{2}{3}\):
\[
A = \frac{2}{3} \times 113.097 \approx \frac{226.194}{3} \approx 75.398
\]

#### Step 5: Reassess and Verify
The calculation appears correct, but we need to ensure the units are consistent. The radius is given in millimeters, so the area will be in square millimeters. However, the answer choices are not in square millimeters, suggesting a possible unit conversion or rounding issue. Let's recheck the problem statement and answer choices.

#### Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated area is approximately \(75.398 \, \text{mm}^2\). However, the answer choices are:
- A. 6.5
- B. 15.6
- C. 22.1
- D. 37.7

None of these match our calculated value. Upon re-examining the problem, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the question or the answer choices. Let's re-evaluate the problem statement and ensure no details were missed.

#### Step 7: Reread and Reflect
The problem asks for the area of the shaded region, which is indeed the sector area. The calculations are correct, but the answer choices seem inconsistent with the problem's scale. Given the instructions to select the closest answer, we must choose the closest value among the provided options.

### Solution Section:

The calculated area of the shaded sector is approximately \(75.398 \, \text{mm}^2\). However, since the answer choices do not match this value, we must select the closest option based on the provided choices. Among the options:
- A. 6.5
- B. 15.6
- C. 22.1
- D. 37.7

The closest value to our calculated area is **D. 37.7**.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
