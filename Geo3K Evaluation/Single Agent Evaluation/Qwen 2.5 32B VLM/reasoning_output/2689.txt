QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:

### Thought Section

1. **Analyze the Image**:
   - The image shows a larger square with side length 5 units.
   - Inside this larger square, there are smaller segments labeled with lengths:
     - Segment \( AB \) has a length of 2 units.
     - Segment \( FG \) has a length of 2 units.
     - Segment \( AH \) has a length of 2 units.
   - The remaining parts of the sides of the square are also labeled, indicating their lengths.

2. **Identify Perimeter Components**:
   - The perimeter of the figure includes all the outer edges of the shape, including the segments formed by the internal divisions.
   - To find the perimeter, we need to sum up all the external and internal segments that form the boundary of the figure.

3. **Break Down the Perimeter**:
   - **Top Side (DC)**: The top side of the larger square is 5 units long.
   - **Right Side (CE)**: The right side of the larger square is also 5 units long.
   - **Bottom Side (HE)**: The bottom side consists of two segments:
     - \( HE = 5 \) (the full bottom side of the larger square).
   - **Left Side (AD)**: The left side consists of two segments:
     - \( AD = 5 \) (the full left side of the larger square).

4. **Internal Segments**:
   - There are additional internal segments that contribute to the perimeter:
     - **Segment \( AB \)**: Length = 2 units.
     - **Segment \( FG \)**: Length = 2 units.
     - **Segment \( AH \)**: Length = 2 units.
   - These internal segments effectively add to the perimeter because they are part of the boundary of the figure.

5. **Calculate the Total Perimeter**:
   - Sum all the external and internal segments:
     - Top side \( DC = 5 \)
     - Right side \( CE = 5 \)
     - Bottom side \( HE = 5 \)
     - Left side \( AD = 5 \)
     - Internal segments: \( AB = 2 \), \( FG = 2 \), \( AH = 2 \)

   - Total perimeter:
     \[
     \text{Perimeter} = DC + CE + HE + AD + AB + FG + AH
     \]
     \[
     \text{Perimeter} = 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 26
     \]

6. **Compare with Answer Choices**:
   - The calculated perimeter is 26, but the answer choices do not include 26. This suggests a possible misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the internal segments and ensure they are correctly accounted for.

7. **Re-evaluation**:
   - Upon re-examining the figure, the internal segments \( AB \), \( FG \), and \( AH \) are indeed part of the boundary and should be included in the perimeter calculation.
   - The total perimeter remains:
     \[
     \text{Perimeter} = 26
     \]

8. **Rounding and Selection**:
   - Since the calculated perimeter is 26 and the closest answer choice is not available, we must select the closest option provided.

### Solution Section

Based on the detailed analysis and calculations:

- The total perimeter of the figure is 26.
- The closest answer choice to 26 is not listed among the provided options (A, B, C, D).

However, since the problem explicitly states to select one of the provided options, and the closest value to 26 is not available, we must re-evaluate the interpretation or consider potential misalignment between the problem and the answer choices.

Given the constraints and the provided answer choices, the closest feasible option is:

\[
\boxed{D}
\]

Final Answer: D
