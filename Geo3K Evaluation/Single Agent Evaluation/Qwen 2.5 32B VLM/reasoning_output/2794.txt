### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the **scale factor** between two similar figures (a blue rectangle and a green rectangle) using their given areas. The key points from the problem are:

1. **Blue Rectangle:**
   - One side length is given as \(4\) inches.
   - The area is \(8\) square inches.

2. **Green Rectangle:**
   - One side length is labeled as \(x\) inches.
   - The area is \(32\) square inches.

3. **Similarity:** Since the rectangles are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional, and the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths.

---

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Determine the dimensions of the blue rectangle.**
The area of a rectangle is given by:
\[
\text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width}
\]
For the blue rectangle:
\[
\text{Area} = 8 \quad \text{and} \quad \text{one side} = 4 \text{ inches}
\]
Let the other side be \(w\). Then:
\[
4 \times w = 8
\]
Solving for \(w\):
\[
w = \frac{8}{4} = 2 \text{ inches}
\]
So, the dimensions of the blue rectangle are \(4\) inches by \(2\) inches.

#### **Step 2: Determine the dimensions of the green rectangle.**
For the green rectangle:
\[
\text{Area} = 32 \quad \text{and} \quad \text{one side} = x \text{ inches}
\]
Let the other side be \(y\). Then:
\[
x \times y = 32
\]

Since the rectangles are similar, the ratio of their corresponding side lengths is constant. Let the scale factor from the blue rectangle to the green rectangle be \(k\). This means:
\[
\frac{x}{4} = k \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{y}{2} = k
\]

#### **Step 3: Use the relationship between the areas of similar figures.**
The ratio of the areas of two similar figures is the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths. Therefore:
\[
\frac{\text{Area of green rectangle}}{\text{Area of blue rectangle}} = k^2
\]
Substitute the given areas:
\[
\frac{32}{8} = k^2
\]
Simplify:
\[
4 = k^2
\]
Taking the square root of both sides:
\[
k = \sqrt{4} = 2
\]

#### **Step 4: Interpret the scale factor.**
The scale factor \(k\) is the ratio of the corresponding side lengths of the green rectangle to the blue rectangle. Since we are asked for the scale factor from the blue rectangle to the green rectangle, the scale factor is:
\[
k = 2
\]
This means the green rectangle is \(2\) times larger than the blue rectangle in each dimension.

#### **Step 5: Match the scale factor to the answer choices.**
The scale factor from the blue rectangle to the green rectangle is \(2\), which corresponds to the fraction \(\frac{2}{1}\).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
