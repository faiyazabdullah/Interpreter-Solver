### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Image
The image shows a circle with several labeled points (A, B, C, D) and angles. Here's what we can observe:
- Point A is connected to point B with a line segment.
- There is a right angle at point B, indicated by the square symbol.
- The measure of the angle at point A is given as \(120^\circ\).
- The label "9" indicates the angle we need to find, which is at point C.

#### Step 2: Identify Geometric Relationships
1. **Right Angle at B**: Since there is a right angle at B, \(\angle ABC = 90^\circ\).
2. **Central Angle and Inscribed Angle**: The angle at A (\(120^\circ\)) appears to be a central angle because it is subtended by the arc BD. The angle at C (\(\angle 9\)) is an inscribed angle subtending the same arc BD.
3. **Inscribed Angle Theorem**: According to the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc. Therefore, \(\angle 9 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{central angle}\).

#### Step 3: Calculate the Central Angle
The central angle subtending arc BD is given as \(120^\circ\). Using the Inscribed Angle Theorem:
\[
\angle 9 = \frac{1}{2} \times 120^\circ = 60^\circ
\]

#### Step 4: Verify the Context
- The right angle at B does not affect the calculation of \(\angle 9\) directly because \(\angle 9\) is determined solely by the relationship between the central angle and the inscribed angle.
- The label "9" confirms that we are looking for the measure of the inscribed angle at point C.

#### Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated value of \(\angle 9\) is \(60^\circ\). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 60
- B. 120
- C. 240
- D. 300

The correct choice is \(60^\circ\).

### Solution Section

Based on the analysis and application of the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the measure of \(\angle 9\) is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]
