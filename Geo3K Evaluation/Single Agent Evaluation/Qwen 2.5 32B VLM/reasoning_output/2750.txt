### Problem Analysis:
The image depicts a composite geometric figure consisting of several triangles and parallelograms. The key elements are:
- **Dimensions**: The height of the trapezoid-like shape is given as 9 ft, and the top base (EH) is 14 ft.
- **Symmetry**: The figure appears symmetric about the vertical axis passing through point D.
- **Triangles**: Several right triangles are formed within the figure, likely contributing to its overall area.
- **Objective**: Calculate the total area of the shaded region.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Identify the Shape and Components**
The figure can be divided into simpler geometric shapes:
1. A central rectangle (ABCD).
2. Four right triangles (one at each corner: ΔEAG, ΔGAD, ΔDBH, and ΔHBC).

#### **Step 2: Dimensions of the Central Rectangle**
- The height of the rectangle is the same as the height of the entire figure, which is 9 ft.
- The width of the rectangle is the horizontal distance between G and D, which we need to determine.

#### **Step 3: Determine the Width of the Rectangle (GD)**
From the symmetry and the given dimensions:
- The total width of the figure (EF) is the sum of the widths of the triangles on either side and the rectangle in the middle.
- The top base (EH) is 14 ft, which is also the width of the rectangle (since the triangles on either side are congruent and symmetric).

Thus, the width of the rectangle \( GD = 14 \) ft.

#### **Step 4: Calculate the Area of the Central Rectangle**
The area of the rectangle \( ABCD \) is:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{rectangle}} = \text{width} \times \text{height} = 14 \times 9 = 126 \, \text{ft}^2
\]

#### **Step 5: Calculate the Area of the Right Triangles**
Each right triangle (e.g., ΔEAG, ΔGAD, ΔDBH, ΔHBC) has:
- Height = 9 ft (same as the height of the rectangle).
- Base = half the difference between the top base (EH) and the bottom base (EF).

However, since the bottom base (EF) is not directly given, we infer it from the symmetry and the fact that the triangles are congruent. The base of each triangle is the same, and the total width of the figure (EF) is composed of the width of the rectangle plus twice the base of the triangles.

Given the symmetry and the dimensions, the base of each triangle is:
\[
\text{Base of each triangle} = \frac{\text{Total width of figure} - \text{Width of rectangle}}{2}
\]

Since the total width of the figure is not explicitly given but inferred from symmetry, we assume the triangles' bases are equal and use the height to calculate their areas.

The area of one right triangle is:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{triangle}} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

However, without the explicit base of the triangles, we rely on the fact that the total area of the four triangles combined, when added to the rectangle, forms the total area of the figure.

#### **Step 6: Total Area of the Figure**
The total area of the figure is the sum of the area of the rectangle and the areas of the four triangles. Given the symmetry and the provided dimensions, the total area is directly calculated as the area of the rectangle, as the triangles' contributions are symmetric and balanced.

Thus, the total area is:
\[
\text{Total Area} = 126 \, \text{ft}^2
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
