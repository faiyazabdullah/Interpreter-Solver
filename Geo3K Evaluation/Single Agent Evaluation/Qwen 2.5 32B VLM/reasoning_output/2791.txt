### Problem Analysis:
The image depicts a circle with several points labeled on its circumference and inside it. The key elements are:
- Points \( F, G, H, J \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
- Points \( K \) and \( L \) are inside the circle.
- Line segments \( FG, GH, FK, \) and \( a \) (which appears to be \( KJ \)) are given or need to be determined.
- The problem states:
  - \( FG = 18 \)
  - \( GH = 42 \)
  - \( FK = 15 \)
- We need to find the value of \( a \), which is the length of segment \( KJ \).

#### Step 1: Understanding the Geometric Configuration
From the image, we observe:
- \( FG \) and \( GH \) are chords of the circle.
- \( F, G, H, \) and \( J \) are points on the circle.
- \( K \) is a point inside the circle, and \( FK \) is a line segment from the circumference to this internal point.
- \( a \) (labeled as \( KJ \)) is another internal segment connecting \( K \) to another point \( J \) on the circle.

#### Step 2: Identifying Relevant Geometric Relationships
The problem does not explicitly mention any specific geometric theorem (e.g., Power of a Point, Similar Triangles, etc.). However, the configuration suggests that we might use the **Power of a Point theorem** or some form of proportional relationship involving the segments.

#### Step 3: Applying the Power of a Point Theorem
The **Power of a Point theorem** states that for a point \( P \) inside a circle, if two secant lines intersect the circle at points \( A, B \) and \( C, D \), then:
\[
PA \cdot PB = PC \cdot PD
\]
In our case, \( K \) is a point inside the circle, and the segments \( FK \) and \( KJ \) are involved. However, the direct application of Power of a Point is not immediately clear without additional information about other intersecting lines.

#### Step 4: Exploring Proportional Relationships
Given the lengths \( FG = 18 \), \( GH = 42 \), and \( FK = 15 \), we need to determine \( a = KJ \). Since no explicit geometric relationship (like similarity or parallelism) is mentioned, we consider the possibility of a simple proportional relationship or a direct calculation based on the given segments.

#### Step 5: Summarizing the Given Information
- \( FG = 18 \)
- \( GH = 42 \)
- \( FK = 15 \)
- We need to find \( a = KJ \).

#### Step 6: Hypothesizing a Relationship
Since the problem does not provide enough information for a complex geometric theorem, we hypothesize that the relationship might be straightforward. One possible approach is to assume that the internal segment \( KJ \) is related to the external segments in a simple additive or proportional manner.

#### Step 7: Calculating \( a \)
Given the lack of additional geometric constraints, we consider the simplest possibility:
- If \( K \) is a point dividing the internal segments proportionally or additively, we might assume:
\[
a = KJ = FK + GH
\]
This is a reasonable assumption based on the given lengths and the lack of complex geometric constraints.

Calculating:
\[
a = FK + GH = 15 + 42 = 57
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
