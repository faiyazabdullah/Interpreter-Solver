### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a geometric figure with several segments labeled with algebraic expressions. The goal is to find the value of \( x \). Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the thought process:

#### Step 1: Identify Given Information
- The figure contains multiple parallel lines and segments.
- The segments are labeled with algebraic expressions:
  - Top row: \( 2x + 3 \) and \( \frac{4}{3}y + 1 \)
  - Middle row: \( 6 - x \) and \( 2y \)
  - Bottom row: Unlabeled segments (not directly relevant to solving for \( x \)).

#### Step 2: Understand Relationships
The key observation is that the segments in the middle row are parallel and appear to be equal in length due to the consistent spacing and alignment of the arrows. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on the equality of these segments:
\[ 6 - x = 2y \]

#### Step 3: Solve for One Variable in Terms of Another
From the equation \( 6 - x = 2y \), solve for \( y \):
\[ 2y = 6 - x \]
\[ y = \frac{6 - x}{2} \]

#### Step 4: Use Additional Constraints
The top row also provides another relationship involving \( x \) and \( y \). The segments \( 2x + 3 \) and \( \frac{4}{3}y + 1 \) are likely equal due to the parallel nature and consistent spacing:
\[ 2x + 3 = \frac{4}{3}y + 1 \]

#### Step 5: Substitute \( y \) from Step 3 into the Equation
Substitute \( y = \frac{6 - x}{2} \) into \( 2x + 3 = \frac{4}{3}y + 1 \):
\[ 2x + 3 = \frac{4}{3} \left( \frac{6 - x}{2} \right) + 1 \]

Simplify the right-hand side:
\[ 2x + 3 = \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{6 - x}{2} + 1 \]
\[ 2x + 3 = \frac{2(6 - x)}{3} + 1 \]
\[ 2x + 3 = \frac{12 - 2x}{3} + 1 \]

#### Step 6: Eliminate the Fraction
To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 3:
\[ 3(2x + 3) = 12 - 2x + 3 \]
\[ 6x + 9 = 15 - 2x \]

#### Step 7: Solve for \( x \)
Combine like terms:
\[ 6x + 2x = 15 - 9 \]
\[ 8x = 6 \]
\[ x = \frac{6}{8} \]
\[ x = \frac{3}{4} \]

#### Step 8: Verify the Solution
Substitute \( x = \frac{3}{4} \) back into the original equations to ensure consistency:
- For \( y \):
  \[ y = \frac{6 - x}{2} = \frac{6 - \frac{3}{4}}{2} = \frac{\frac{24}{4} - \frac{3}{4}}{2} = \frac{\frac{21}{4}}{2} = \frac{21}{8} \]

- Check the top row:
  \[ 2x + 3 = 2\left(\frac{3}{4}\right) + 3 = \frac{6}{4} + 3 = \frac{3}{2} + 3 = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{6}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]
  \[ \frac{4}{3}y + 1 = \frac{4}{3}\left(\frac{21}{8}\right) + 1 = \frac{84}{24} + 1 = \frac{7}{2} + 1 = \frac{7}{2} + \frac{2}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]

Both sides are equal, confirming the solution.

### Final Answer:
The value of \( x \) is \( \frac{3}{4} \), which corresponds to option C.

Final Answer: **C**
