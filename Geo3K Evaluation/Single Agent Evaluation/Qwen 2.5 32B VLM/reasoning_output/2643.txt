### Problem Analysis:
The image depicts a geometric figure with several intersecting lines and labeled angles. The goal is to find the value of \( x \) based on the given angle expressions. Here's a breakdown of the information:

1. **Angles at Point \( O \)**:
   - There are three angles around point \( O \):
     - \( (7x + 9)^\circ \)
     - \( (7y - 4)^\circ \)
     - \( (11x - 1)^\circ \)

2. **Sum of Angles Around a Point**:
   - The sum of the angles around a point is always \( 360^\circ \).

3. **Objective**:
   - Use the angle sum property to set up an equation involving \( x \) and \( y \).
   - Solve for \( x \).

---

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Sum of Angles Around Point \( O \)
The sum of the angles around point \( O \) is:
\[
(7x + 9) + (7y - 4) + (11x - 1) = 360
\]

#### Step 2: Simplify the Equation
Combine like terms:
\[
7x + 11x + 7y - 4 + 9 - 1 = 360
\]
\[
18x + 7y + 4 = 360
\]
Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[
18x + 7y = 356
\]

#### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
To isolate \( x \), we need another equation involving \( y \). However, the problem does not provide a direct relationship between \( x \) and \( y \). We must assume that the problem intends for us to solve for \( x \) in terms of the given choices.

#### Step 4: Test the Given Choices for \( x \)
We will test each choice for \( x \) to see which one satisfies the equation \( 18x + 7y = 356 \).

##### Choice A: \( x = 11 \)
Substitute \( x = 11 \) into the equation:
\[
18(11) + 7y = 356
\]
\[
198 + 7y = 356
\]
Subtract 198 from both sides:
\[
7y = 158
\]
\[
y = \frac{158}{7}
\]
Since \( y \) is not an integer, \( x = 11 \) is not a valid solution.

##### Choice B: \( x = 12 \)
Substitute \( x = 12 \) into the equation:
\[
18(12) + 7y = 356
\]
\[
216 + 7y = 356
\]
Subtract 216 from both sides:
\[
7y = 140
\]
\[
y = 20
\]
Since \( y \) is an integer, \( x = 12 \) is a valid solution.

##### Choice C: \( x = 13 \)
Substitute \( x = 13 \) into the equation:
\[
18(13) + 7y = 356
\]
\[
234 + 7y = 356
\]
Subtract 234 from both sides:
\[
7y = 122
\]
\[
y = \frac{122}{7}
\]
Since \( y \) is not an integer, \( x = 13 \) is not a valid solution.

##### Choice D: \( x = 14 \)
Substitute \( x = 14 \) into the equation:
\[
18(14) + 7y = 356
\]
\[
252 + 7y = 356
\]
Subtract 252 from both sides:
\[
7y = 104
\]
\[
y = \frac{104}{7}
\]
Since \( y \) is not an integer, \( x = 14 \) is not a valid solution.

#### Step 5: Conclusion
The only valid solution is \( x = 12 \), as it results in an integer value for \( y \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
