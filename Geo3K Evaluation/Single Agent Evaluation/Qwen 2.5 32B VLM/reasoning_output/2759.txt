### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a parallelogram \( JKLM \) with the following details:
- The base \( ML \) is given as \( 4 \) cm.
- The height (perpendicular distance from \( J \) to \( ML \)) is given as \( 6 \) cm.
- The side \( KL \) is given as \( 7.2 \) cm, but it is not directly relevant to calculating the area since the area of a parallelogram depends only on its base and height.

The task is to find the area of the parallelogram \( JKLM \).

---

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Recall the formula for the area of a parallelogram
The area \( A \) of a parallelogram is given by:
\[
A = \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
Here, the base is the length of one of the sides, and the height is the perpendicular distance from the opposite side to the base.

#### Step 2: Identify the base and height
From the image:
- The base \( ML \) is \( 4 \) cm.
- The height (perpendicular distance from \( J \) to \( ML \)) is \( 6 \) cm.

#### Step 3: Apply the formula
Substitute the values of the base and height into the formula:
\[
A = 4 \, \text{cm} \times 6 \, \text{cm} = 24 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### Step 4: Verify the calculation
The base and height are perpendicular to each other, so the formula \( A = \text{base} \times \text{height} \) is correctly applied. There are no additional constraints or ambiguities in the problem that would affect this calculation.

#### Step 5: Compare with the answer choices
The calculated area is \( 24 \, \text{cm}^2 \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 12
- B. 22.4
- C. 24
- D. 48

The closest match is \( 24 \).

### Solution Section:

The area of the parallelogram \( JKLM \) is:
\[
A = 4 \, \text{cm} \times 6 \, \text{cm} = 24 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
