### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a triangle \( \triangle MNO \) with sides labeled as follows:
- \( MN = 6 \)
- \( MO = 3 \frac{3}{5} = \frac{18}{5} \)
- \( NO = 5 \)

Inside \( \triangle MNO \), there is a smaller triangle \( \triangle PQO \) formed by points \( P \), \( Q \), and \( O \). Points \( Q \) and \( N \) are connected by a line segment, and points \( P \) and \( O \) are also connected by a line segment. The question asks us to find the length of \( QP \).

### Key Observations:
1. **Parallel Lines**: The pink arrows indicate that \( PQ \parallel NO \) and \( QN \parallel PO \). This suggests that \( \triangle PQO \) is similar to \( \triangle MNO \) due to the properties of parallel lines creating similar triangles.
2. **Proportional Sides**: Since \( \triangle PQO \sim \triangle MNO \), the corresponding sides are proportional. We can use this property to find the length of \( QP \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Confirm Similarity
Since \( PQ \parallel NO \) and \( QN \parallel PO \), \( \triangle PQO \) is similar to \( \triangle MNO \) by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. This means:
\[
\frac{QP}{MN} = \frac{PO}{MO} = \frac{QO}{NO}
\]

#### Step 2: Use Given Measurements
We know:
- \( MN = 6 \)
- \( MO = \frac{18}{5} \)
- \( NO = 5 \)
- \( QO = 3 \frac{3}{5} = \frac{18}{5} \) (since \( QO \) is part of \( MO \) and \( Q \) divides \( MO \) proportionally)

#### Step 3: Set Up Proportion for \( QP \)
Using the similarity ratio:
\[
\frac{QP}{MN} = \frac{QO}{MO}
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
\frac{QP}{6} = \frac{\frac{18}{5}}{\frac{18}{5}}
\]
Since \( QO = MO \), the ratio simplifies to:
\[
\frac{QP}{6} = 1
\]
Thus:
\[
QP = 6
\]

#### Step 4: Verify the Result
The proportionality holds because \( QP \) is directly proportional to \( MN \) with the same scaling factor as \( QO \) to \( MO \). Since \( QO = MO \), the scaling factor is 1, confirming that \( QP = MN = 6 \).

### Final Answer:
The length of \( QP \) is \( 6 \).
