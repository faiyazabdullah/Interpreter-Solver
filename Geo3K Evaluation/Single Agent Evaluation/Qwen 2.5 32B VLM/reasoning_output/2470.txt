### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the given information
- The figure shows a **rhombus** \( LMPQ \).
- The side length \( MP = 10 \). Since all sides of a rhombus are equal, each side of the rhombus is also 10.
- Angles are given as:
  - \( m\angle QLM = 2x^2 - 10 \)
  - \( m\angle QPM = 8x \)

#### Step 2: Properties of a rhombus
- All sides of a rhombus are equal.
- Opposite angles are equal.
- Adjacent angles are supplementary (sum to 180Â°).

#### Step 3: Use the angle properties
Since \( LMPQ \) is a rhombus:
- \( \angle QLM \) and \( \angle QPM \) are adjacent angles at vertex \( Q \). Therefore, they are supplementary:
  \[
  m\angle QLM + m\angle QPM = 180^\circ
  \]
- Substitute the given expressions for the angles:
  \[
  (2x^2 - 10) + 8x = 180
  \]

#### Step 4: Solve the equation
Simplify the equation:
\[
2x^2 + 8x - 10 = 180
\]
\[
2x^2 + 8x - 190 = 0
\]
Divide the entire equation by 2 to simplify:
\[
x^2 + 4x - 95 = 0
\]

#### Step 5: Solve the quadratic equation
Use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 4 \), and \( c = -95 \):
\[
x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4(1)(-95)}}{2(1)}
\]
\[
x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 380}}{2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{396}}{2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{-4 \pm 6\sqrt{11}}{2}
\]
\[
x = -2 \pm 3\sqrt{11}
\]

Since \( x \) represents a measure of an angle, it must be positive. Therefore, we take the positive root:
\[
x = -2 + 3\sqrt{11}
\]

#### Step 6: Verify the solution
While solving for \( x \) is important, the primary goal is to find the perimeter of the rhombus. Since all sides of the rhombus are equal and \( MP = 10 \), the perimeter is:
\[
\text{Perimeter} = 4 \times \text{side length} = 4 \times 10 = 40
\]

#### Step 7: Check consistency with the angle conditions
The exact value of \( x \) is not necessary to determine the perimeter, as the side length is already given. However, the angles must satisfy the supplementary condition, which they do based on the setup.

### Solution Section

The perimeter of the rhombus \( LMPQ \) is:
\[
\boxed{40}
\]
