### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a circle with several points labeled: \( H, J, K, L \). The arc \( \widehat{HL} \) is marked with a central angle of \( 116^\circ \). The task is to find the measure of the arc \( \widehat{JKL} \).

#### Key Observations:
1. **Central Angle and Arc Relationship**: The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of the arc it intercepts.
   - Here, the central angle corresponding to \( \widehat{HL} \) is \( 116^\circ \), so \( \widehat{HL} = 116^\circ \).

2. **Circle's Total Measure**: The total measure of a circle is \( 360^\circ \).

3. **Arc \( \widehat{JKL} \)**: This arc is the remaining part of the circle after removing the arc \( \widehat{HL} \). Therefore, the measure of \( \widehat{JKL} \) can be found by subtracting the measure of \( \widehat{HL} \) from the total measure of the circle.

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to find the measure of the arc \( \widehat{JKL} \). This arc is the portion of the circle that is not part of \( \widehat{HL} \).

#### Step 2: Use the Total Circle Measure
The total measure of a circle is \( 360^\circ \). Since \( \widehat{HL} \) is given as \( 116^\circ \), the remaining arc \( \widehat{JKL} \) can be calculated as:
\[
\text{Measure of } \widehat{JKL} = 360^\circ - \text{Measure of } \widehat{HL}
\]

#### Step 3: Substitute the Given Value
Substitute the measure of \( \widehat{HL} \):
\[
\text{Measure of } \widehat{JKL} = 360^\circ - 116^\circ
\]

#### Step 4: Perform the Calculation
\[
\text{Measure of } \widehat{JKL} = 244^\circ
\]

#### Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated measure of \( \widehat{JKL} \) is \( 244^\circ \). However, this value does not match any of the given answer choices (A. 116, B. 184, C. 232, D. 298). Upon re-examining the problem, it appears there might be a misinterpretation or a typo in the problem setup. Nonetheless, we proceed with the closest match.

#### Step 6: Select the Closest Answer
The closest value to \( 244^\circ \) among the given choices is \( 232^\circ \).

### Solution Section:

After carefully analyzing the problem and performing the necessary calculations, the measure of \( \widehat{JKL} \) is \( 244^\circ \). However, since this value is not listed among the answer choices, we select the closest option.

\[
\boxed{C}
\]
