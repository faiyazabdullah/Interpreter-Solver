### Thought Section

1. **Analyze the Given Information:**
   - The figure is a parallelogram labeled as \(ABCD\).
   - The side lengths are given as follows:
     - \(AB = 20 \, \text{ft}\)
     - \(AD = 18 \, \text{ft}\)
   - The height of the parallelogram is given as \(16 \, \text{ft}\), but this is not directly relevant to finding the perimeter.

2. **Understand What Needs to Be Found:**
   - The problem asks for the **perimeter** of the parallelogram.
   - The formula for the perimeter of a parallelogram is:
     \[
     \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length of one pair of opposite sides} + \text{Length of the other pair of opposite sides})
     \]

3. **Apply Relevant Geometric Properties:**
   - In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in length.
     - Therefore, \(AB = CD = 20 \, \text{ft}\)
     - And \(AD = BC = 18 \, \text{ft}\)

4. **Calculate the Perimeter:**
   - Using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (AB + AD) = 2 \times (20 + 18) = 2 \times 38 = 76 \, \text{ft}
     \]

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - Double-check the values:
     - \(AB = 20 \, \text{ft}\)
     - \(AD = 18 \, \text{ft}\)
     - Perimeter = \(2 \times (20 + 18) = 2 \times 38 = 76 \, \text{ft}\)
   - The calculation is consistent and correct.

6. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated perimeter is \(76 \, \text{ft}\).
   - The answer choices are:
     - A. 70
     - B. 72
     - C. 76
     - D. 78
   - The closest match is \(C. 76\).

7. **Reassess and Reflect:**
   - The height of the parallelogram (16 ft) is not needed for calculating the perimeter, as it pertains to area or other geometric properties.
   - The perimeter calculation is straightforward using the side lengths provided.

### Solution Section

Based on the step-by-step analysis:

1. Opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal: \(AB = CD = 20 \, \text{ft}\) and \(AD = BC = 18 \, \text{ft}\).
2. The perimeter is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (AB + AD) = 2 \times (20 + 18) = 2 \times 38 = 76 \, \text{ft}
   \]
3. The closest answer choice to \(76 \, \text{ft}\) is \(C. 76\).

Final Answer: **C**
