### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with marked angles and some algebraic expressions for the angles. The goal is to find the value of \(x\). Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the given information:

1. **Angle at vertex \(A\)**: \((2y - 56)^\circ\)
2. **Angle at vertex \(B\)**: \(115^\circ\)
3. **Angle at vertex \(C\)**: \((x + 24)^\circ\)
4. **Angle at vertex \(D\)**: \(x^\circ\)

The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is always \(360^\circ\). Therefore, we can use this property to set up an equation involving \(x\) and \(y\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Write the equation for the sum of the interior angles.
The sum of the interior angles of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is:
\[
(2y - 56) + 115 + (x + 24) + x = 360
\]

#### Step 2: Simplify the equation.
Combine like terms:
\[
(2y - 56) + 115 + (x + 24) + x = 360
\]
\[
2y - 56 + 115 + x + 24 + x = 360
\]
\[
2y + 2x + 83 = 360
\]

#### Step 3: Solve for \(2y + 2x\).
Subtract 83 from both sides:
\[
2y + 2x = 277
\]

#### Step 4: Express \(y\) in terms of \(x\) (if possible).
From the equation \(2y + 2x = 277\), we can solve for \(y\):
\[
2y = 277 - 2x
\]
\[
y = \frac{277 - 2x}{2}
\]

However, we do not need the exact value of \(y\) to find \(x\). We can focus on the relationship between the angles.

#### Step 5: Use the given angle relationships to find \(x\).
Notice that the problem does not provide additional constraints on \(y\), so we can directly solve for \(x\) using the simplified equation:
\[
2y + 2x = 277
\]

Since the problem asks for \(x\) and does not require solving for \(y\), we can assume that the value of \(y\) is consistent with the given angles. Let's check the consistency with the answer choices.

#### Step 6: Test the answer choices for \(x\).
We will substitute the given choices for \(x\) into the equation \(2y + 2x = 277\) and see which one fits.

- **Choice A: \(x = 24\)**:
  \[
  2y + 2(24) = 277
  \]
  \[
  2y + 48 = 277
  \]
  \[
  2y = 229
  \]
  \[
  y = 114.5
  \]
  This is a valid solution, but let's check the other choices to ensure accuracy.

- **Choice B: \(x = 56\)**:
  \[
  2y + 2(56) = 277
  \]
  \[
  2y + 112 = 277
  \]
  \[
  2y = 165
  \]
  \[
  y = 82.5
  \]
  This is also a valid solution, but let's continue checking.

- **Choice C: \(x = 65\)**:
  \[
  2y + 2(65) = 277
  \]
  \[
  2y + 130 = 277
  \]
  \[
  2y = 147
  \]
  \[
  y = 73.5
  \]
  This is a valid solution, but let's check the last choice.

- **Choice D: \(x = 115\)**:
  \[
  2y + 2(115) = 277
  \]
  \[
  2y + 230 = 277
  \]
  \[
  2y = 47
  \]
  \[
  y = 23.5
  \]
  This is a valid solution, but we need to determine which one is correct based on the context.

#### Step 7: Verify the consistency of the angles.
Given that the problem does not provide additional constraints on \(y\), we need to check which value of \(x\) makes the most sense geometrically. Since the angles must be positive and reasonable, let's recheck the simplest and most likely value.

From the choices, \(x = 65\) seems to be the most reasonable and consistent with the given angles. Substituting \(x = 65\) into the equation:
\[
2y + 2(65) = 277
\]
\[
2y + 130 = 277
\]
\[
2y = 147
\]
\[
y = 73.5
\]
This is a valid solution, and it fits the context of the problem.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
