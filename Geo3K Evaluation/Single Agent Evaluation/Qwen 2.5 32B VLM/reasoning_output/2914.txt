### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
The image shows a parallelogram labeled \(ABCD\). Key observations:
- The base \(BD\) is given as 22 cm.
- The height (perpendicular distance from \(C\) to \(BD\)) is given as 24 cm.
- The side \(BC\) is given as 26 cm, but it is not directly relevant to calculating the area since we already have the base and height.

#### Step 2: Recall the Formula for the Area of a Parallelogram
The area \(A\) of a parallelogram is given by:
\[
A = \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
Here, the base is \(BD = 22\) cm, and the height is the perpendicular distance from \(C\) to \(BD\), which is 24 cm.

#### Step 3: Substitute the Known Values into the Formula
Using the formula:
\[
A = 22 \times 24
\]

#### Step 4: Perform the Calculation
\[
A = 22 \times 24 = 528
\]

#### Step 5: Check for Rounding Requirements
The problem asks to round to the nearest tenth if necessary. Since the result is an integer (528), no rounding is needed.

#### Step 6: Compare with the Answer Choices
The calculated area is 528. Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 428
- B. 528
- C. 572
- D. 624

The closest match is **B. 528**.

### Solution Section

The area of the parallelogram is calculated as follows:
\[
A = \text{base} \times \text{height} = 22 \times 24 = 528
\]

Final Answer: B
