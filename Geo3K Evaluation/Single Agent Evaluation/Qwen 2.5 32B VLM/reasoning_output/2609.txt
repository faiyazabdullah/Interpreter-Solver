### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the measure of the arc \( \widehat{HJ} \) in the circle centered at \( M \). The given information includes:
- \( FL = 24 \)
- \( HJ = 48 \)
- \( m\widehat{HP} = 65^\circ \)

The image shows a circle with several chords and arcs, and we need to use geometric properties to determine the measure of \( \widehat{HJ} \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the given information**
- \( FL = 24 \): This is the length of the chord \( FL \).
- \( HJ = 48 \): This is the length of the chord \( HJ \).
- \( m\widehat{HP} = 65^\circ \): This is the measure of the arc \( \widehat{HP} \).

#### **Step 2: Identify relevant geometric properties**
1. **Arc and Chord Relationship**: The measure of an arc is directly related to the central angle that subtends it. If \( \theta \) is the central angle, then the measure of the arc is \( \theta \) degrees.
2. **Symmetry and Circle Properties**: The circle is symmetric, and the central angles subtended by equal chords are equal. However, the lengths of the chords \( FL \) and \( HJ \) suggest that \( HJ \) is twice the length of \( FL \), which might indicate a specific relationship between their corresponding arcs.

#### **Step 3: Use the given arc measure**
The measure of \( \widehat{HP} \) is given as \( 65^\circ \). Since \( HJ \) is a chord and \( H \) is one of its endpoints, we need to determine how \( \widehat{HJ} \) relates to \( \widehat{HP} \).

#### **Step 4: Analyze the relationship between \( HJ \) and \( FL \)**
- The length of \( HJ \) is twice the length of \( FL \). This suggests that the arc \( \widehat{HJ} \) might be twice the arc subtended by \( FL \). However, the problem does not provide the arc measure for \( FL \) directly, so we need to infer it from the given information.

#### **Step 5: Use the fact that \( HJ \) spans a larger arc**
Since \( HJ \) is twice as long as \( FL \), and assuming the circle is symmetric, the arc \( \widehat{HJ} \) will span a larger portion of the circle. The key is to use the given \( m\widehat{HP} = 65^\circ \) to infer the measure of \( \widehat{HJ} \).

#### **Step 6: Calculate the measure of \( \widehat{HJ} \)**
- The arc \( \widehat{HJ} \) is a major arc because it spans a significant portion of the circle. The total circumference of the circle is \( 360^\circ \).
- The arc \( \widehat{HP} \) is given as \( 65^\circ \). Since \( HJ \) is a longer chord, the arc \( \widehat{HJ} \) will be a major arc.
- The measure of the major arc \( \widehat{HJ} \) can be found by considering the symmetry and the fact that \( HJ \) is twice the length of \( FL \). This implies that \( \widehat{HJ} \) spans a significant portion of the circle, specifically \( 130^\circ \).

#### **Step 7: Verify the calculation**
- The measure of \( \widehat{HJ} \) is \( 130^\circ \), which is consistent with the given information and the properties of the circle.

### Final Answer:
The measure of \( \widehat{HJ} \) is \( 130^\circ \).
