### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
- The figure shows a circle with center \( O \).
- \( EC \) and \( AB \) are diameters of the circle.
- The circle is divided into four equal central angles: \( \angle BOE \), \( \angle DOE \), \( \angle EOF \), and \( \angle FOA \).
- These angles are congruent, meaning each central angle measures the same.
- We need to find the measure of the arc \( \widehat{AD} \).

#### Step 2: Key Geometric Relationships
1. **Diameters and Circle Properties**:
   - Since \( EC \) and \( AB \) are diameters, they pass through the center \( O \) and divide the circle into two equal halves.
   - Each diameter subtends a semicircle, so the arcs \( \widehat{AE} \), \( \widehat{EB} \), \( \widehat{BC} \), \( \widehat{CD} \), \( \widehat{DA} \), and \( \widehat{AF} \) are part of the circle's circumference.

2. **Central Angles and Arcs**:
   - The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of the arc it subtends.
   - Since the circle is divided into four congruent central angles, each central angle measures:
     \[
     \frac{360^\circ}{4} = 90^\circ.
     \]

3. **Arc Measures**:
   - Each central angle corresponds to an arc of the same measure. Therefore, the arcs \( \widehat{BOE} \), \( \widehat{DOE} \), \( \widehat{EOF} \), and \( \widehat{FOA} \) each measure \( 90^\circ \).

#### Step 3: Identify the Arc \( \widehat{AD} \)
- The arc \( \widehat{AD} \) is composed of two adjacent arcs: \( \widehat{AO} \) and \( \widehat{OD} \).
- From the figure, we can see that \( \widehat{AO} \) corresponds to \( \angle FOA \) and \( \widehat{OD} \) corresponds to \( \angle DOE \).
- Since \( \angle FOA \) and \( \angle DOE \) are both \( 90^\circ \), the total measure of \( \widehat{AD} \) is:
  \[
  m \widehat{AD} = m \widehat{AO} + m \widehat{OD} = 90^\circ + 90^\circ = 180^\circ.
  \]

#### Step 4: Verify the Calculation
- The circle is divided into four equal parts, and each part corresponds to a \( 90^\circ \) central angle.
- The arc \( \widehat{AD} \) spans two of these parts, so its measure is \( 180^\circ \).
- This matches the properties of a circle where the sum of the measures of arcs formed by diameters and their corresponding central angles is consistent.

### Solution Section

Based on the analysis and calculations:
- Each central angle is \( 90^\circ \).
- The arc \( \widehat{AD} \) spans two of these central angles, so its measure is \( 180^\circ \).

Thus, the measure of \( \widehat{AD} \) is \( 180^\circ \).

Final Answer: \boxed{C}
