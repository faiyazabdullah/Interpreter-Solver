### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a triangle with labeled sides and expressions involving \( x \). The sides are:
- \( AB = 2x + 11 \)
- \( AC = 6x - 9 \)

Additionally, the triangle has markings indicating that \( \angle ABC \) and \( \angle ACB \) are congruent. This implies that the triangle is **isosceles**, with \( AB = AC \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Identify the key geometric property**
Since \( \angle ABC \cong \angle ACB \), the triangle is isosceles, and the sides opposite these angles must be equal. Therefore:
\[
AB = AC
\]

#### **Step 2: Set up the equation based on the side lengths**
From the given expressions for the sides:
\[
AB = 2x + 11
\]
\[
AC = 6x - 9
\]
Setting \( AB = AC \):
\[
2x + 11 = 6x - 9
\]

#### **Step 3: Solve the equation for \( x \)**
Rearrange the equation to isolate \( x \):
\[
2x + 11 = 6x - 9
\]
Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:
\[
11 = 4x - 9
\]
Add 9 to both sides:
\[
20 = 4x
\]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[
x = 5
\]

#### **Step 4: Verify the solution**
Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the expressions for \( AB \) and \( AC \):
\[
AB = 2(5) + 11 = 10 + 11 = 21
\]
\[
AC = 6(5) - 9 = 30 - 9 = 21
\]
Since \( AB = AC = 21 \), the solution is consistent with the isosceles property of the triangle.

#### **Step 5: Compare with the answer choices**
The calculated value of \( x \) is 5. Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 2
- B. 5
- C. 6
- D. 9

The correct choice is \( B \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
