### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the measure of the arc \( \widehat{IHJ} \) in the given circle. Let's break down the problem step by step:

#### Given Information:
1. \( H, K, I, G \) are points on the circle.
2. \( HK \) and \( IG \) are diameters of the circle.
3. \( L \) is the center of the circle.
4. The angle \( \angle HLJ = 59^\circ \).

#### Objective:
Find the measure of the arc \( \widehat{IHJ} \).

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Understand the Geometry
- Since \( HK \) and \( IG \) are diameters, they pass through the center \( L \) of the circle.
- The angle \( \angle HLJ = 59^\circ \) is a central angle subtended by the arc \( \widehat{HJ} \).
- The measure of an arc is equal to the measure of its corresponding central angle.

#### Step 2: Calculate the Measure of Arc \( \widehat{HJ} \)
- The arc \( \widehat{HJ} \) is directly subtended by the central angle \( \angle HLJ \).
- Therefore, the measure of \( \widehat{HJ} \) is \( 59^\circ \).

#### Step 3: Determine the Measure of Arc \( \widehat{IHJ} \)
- The arc \( \widehat{IHJ} \) is the major arc formed by the points \( I, H, \) and \( J \).
- To find the measure of the major arc \( \widehat{IHJ} \), we need to consider the full circle and subtract the minor arc \( \widehat{HJ} \) from it.
- The total measure of a circle is \( 360^\circ \).
- The minor arc \( \widehat{HJ} \) measures \( 59^\circ \).
- Therefore, the major arc \( \widehat{IHJ} \) is:
  \[
  \text{Measure of } \widehat{IHJ} = 360^\circ - 59^\circ = 301^\circ
  \]

#### Step 4: Verify the Calculation
- The arc \( \widehat{IHJ} \) is indeed the major arc because it spans more than half of the circle.
- The calculation \( 360^\circ - 59^\circ = 301^\circ \) is correct.

### Solution Section:

Based on the above reasoning, the measure of the arc \( \widehat{IHJ} \) is \( 301^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
