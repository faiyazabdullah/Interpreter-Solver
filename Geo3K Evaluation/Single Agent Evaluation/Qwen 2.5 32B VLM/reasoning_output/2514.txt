### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a geometric figure with several labeled points and segments. We are tasked with finding the length of segment \( KJ \) given the following information:
- \( GJ = 8 \)
- \( GH = 12 \)
- \( HI = 4 \)

The figure includes parallel lines (indicated by the pink arrows) and perpendicular lines (indicated by the blue right-angle symbols). These geometric properties will guide our analysis.

### Thought Section:
1. **Identify Key Properties:**
   - The pink arrows indicate that segments \( KH \) and \( JI \) are parallel. This suggests that \( \triangle GKH \) and \( \triangle GJI \) may be similar triangles due to the parallel lines.
   - The blue right-angle symbols indicate that \( \triangle GKH \) and \( \triangle GJI \) are right triangles.

2. **Analyze Similar Triangles:**
   - Since \( KH \parallel JI \), \( \triangle GKH \sim \triangle GJI \) by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. This means corresponding sides are proportional.
   - Let \( KJ = x \) and \( KH = y \). From the similarity, we have:
     \[
     \frac{GK}{GJ} = \frac{KH}{JI}
     \]

3. **Determine Lengths Using Given Information:**
   - \( GJ = 8 \)
   - \( GH = 12 \)
   - \( HI = 4 \)
   - Since \( H \) and \( I \) are collinear with \( G \), \( GI = GH + HI = 12 + 4 = 16 \).

4. **Use Proportional Relationships:**
   - From the similarity \( \triangle GKH \sim \triangle GJI \):
     \[
     \frac{GK}{GJ} = \frac{KH}{JI}
     \]
   - We need to express \( GK \) and \( KH \) in terms of known lengths. Notice that \( K \) and \( J \) are points on \( GJ \) and \( GI \) respectively, and the parallelism ensures the proportionality.

5. **Set Up Proportion Based on Known Lengths:**
   - Since \( GJ = 8 \) and \( GI = 16 \), the ratio of the bases \( GJ \) to \( GI \) is:
     \[
     \frac{GJ}{GI} = \frac{8}{16} = \frac{1}{2}
     \]
   - This ratio applies to the corresponding heights as well. Therefore:
     \[
     \frac{KJ}{JI} = \frac{1}{2}
     \]
   - Since \( JI = HI = 4 \):
     \[
     \frac{KJ}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \implies KJ = 4 \times \frac{1}{2} = 2
     \]

### Solution Section:
From the above analysis, we have determined that the length of \( KJ \) is:
\[
KJ = 2
\]

Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 2
- B. 4
- C. 6
- D. 8

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
