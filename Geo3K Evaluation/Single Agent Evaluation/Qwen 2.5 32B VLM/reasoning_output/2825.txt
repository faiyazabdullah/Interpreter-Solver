### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a circle with center \( P \) and several labeled points and segments. The key information provided is:
- \( JK = 10 \)
- The measure of the arc \( \widehat{JKL} = 134^\circ \)
- We need to find the measure of the arc \( \widehat{JL} \).

#### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry
1. **Circle Properties**: The circle has center \( P \), and \( J, K, L, M \) are points on the circumference.
2. **Arc Measure**: The measure of an arc is the angle subtended by the arc at the center of the circle.
3. **Given Arc**: \( \widehat{JKL} = 134^\circ \). This arc includes points \( J, K, \) and \( L \).
4. **Objective**: Find the measure of \( \widehat{JL} \).

#### Step 2: Analyzing the Arcs
- The arc \( \widehat{JKL} \) is part of the circle, and its measure is given as \( 134^\circ \).
- The total measure of a circle is \( 360^\circ \).
- To find \( \widehat{JL} \), we need to determine the relationship between \( \widehat{JKL} \) and \( \widehat{JL} \).

#### Step 3: Breaking Down the Arcs
- The arc \( \widehat{JKL} \) can be split into two parts:
  1. \( \widehat{JK} \)
  2. \( \widehat{KL} \)
- However, the problem does not provide the measures of these individual arcs directly. Instead, we focus on the fact that \( \widehat{JL} \) is part of the larger arc \( \widehat{JKL} \).

#### Step 4: Using the Total Circle Measure
- The total measure of the circle is \( 360^\circ \).
- The arc \( \widehat{JKL} \) is \( 134^\circ \).
- The remaining arc, which is the rest of the circle excluding \( \widehat{JKL} \), is:
  \[
  360^\circ - 134^\circ = 226^\circ
  \]
- This remaining arc is composed of \( \widehat{LMJ} \).

#### Step 5: Identifying \( \widehat{JL} \)
- The arc \( \widehat{JL} \) is part of the larger arc \( \widehat{JKL} \).
- Since \( \widehat{JKL} = 134^\circ \), and \( \widehat{JL} \) is a segment of this arc, we need to determine how \( \widehat{JL} \) relates to \( \widehat{JKL} \).

#### Step 6: Considering Symmetry and Given Information
- The problem does not provide additional information about the specific measures of \( \widehat{JK} \) or \( \widehat{KL} \). However, since \( \widehat{JKL} = 134^\circ \) and \( \widehat{JL} \) is a segment of this arc, we infer that \( \widehat{JL} \) is less than \( 134^\circ \).
- The most straightforward interpretation is that \( \widehat{JL} \) is the smaller arc connecting \( J \) and \( L \) within \( \widehat{JKL} \).

#### Step 7: Calculating \( \widehat{JL} \)
- Since \( \widehat{JKL} = 134^\circ \) and \( \widehat{JL} \) is a segment of this arc, we assume \( \widehat{JL} \) is the smaller arc directly connecting \( J \) and \( L \).
- Without additional information about the division of \( \widehat{JKL} \), we assume \( \widehat{JL} \) is the smallest possible arc, which is \( \boxed{A} \).

### Solution:
Based on the analysis, the measure of \( \widehat{JL} \) is \( 46^\circ \).

Final Answer: \boxed{A}
