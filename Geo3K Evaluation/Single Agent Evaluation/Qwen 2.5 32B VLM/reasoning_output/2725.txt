### Problem Analysis:
We are given a geometric figure involving three circles \(\odot A\), \(\odot B\), and \(\odot C\) with diameters 10, 30, and 10 units, respectively. The problem states that \(AZ \cong CW\) and \(CW = 2\). We need to find the length of \(YW\).

#### Step 1: Understanding the Given Information
1. **Diameters of the Circles**:
   - \(\odot A\): Diameter = 10 units.
   - \(\odot B\): Diameter = 30 units.
   - \(\odot C\): Diameter = 10 units.

2. **Relationships**:
   - \(AZ \cong CW\): This means the segments \(AZ\) and \(CW\) are congruent.
   - \(CW = 2\): The length of segment \(CW\) is given as 2 units.

3. **Key Points**:
   - \(Z\) and \(W\) are points on the circles \(\odot A\) and \(\odot C\), respectively.
   - \(Y\) is a point on the circle \(\odot B\).
   - The diameters of \(\odot A\) and \(\odot C\) are equal, so their radii are also equal.

#### Step 2: Identifying Key Relationships
- Since \(AZ \cong CW\) and \(CW = 2\), it follows that \(AZ = 2\).
- The diameter of \(\odot B\) is 30 units, so its radius is \(15\) units.

#### Step 3: Analyzing the Configuration
- The circles \(\odot A\) and \(\odot C\) are congruent because they have the same diameter (10 units).
- The centers of the circles \(\odot A\) and \(\odot C\) are aligned along the same line as the center of \(\odot B\).
- The segment \(YW\) is part of the larger circle \(\odot B\), and we need to determine its length.

#### Step 4: Using the Congruence Condition
- Since \(AZ = 2\) and \(CW = 2\), the segments \(AZ\) and \(CW\) are equal.
- The configuration suggests that the points \(Z\) and \(W\) are symmetrically placed relative to the centers of their respective circles.

#### Step 5: Calculating \(YW\)
- The diameter of \(\odot B\) is 30 units, so the total length from one side of the circle to the other is 30 units.
- The segment \(YW\) is part of this diameter, and since \(AZ = CW = 2\), the remaining segment \(YW\) must account for the rest of the diameter minus the segments \(AZ\) and \(CW\).

#### Step 6: Final Calculation
- The total diameter of \(\odot B\) is 30 units.
- The segments \(AZ\) and \(CW\) each contribute 2 units, but these do not directly affect the calculation of \(YW\) within \(\odot B\).
- Therefore, the length of \(YW\) is simply the diameter of \(\odot B\), which is 30 units.

### Solution:
The length of \(YW\) is the diameter of \(\odot B\), which is 30 units.

Final Answer: \boxed{D}
