### Problem Analysis:
We are given a rectangle \( D E F G \) with the following information:
- \( m \angle E D F = 5x - 3 \)
- \( m \angle D F G = 3x + 7 \)

We need to find the measure of \( \angle E D F \).

#### Step 1: Understanding the Properties of a Rectangle
In a rectangle:
1. All interior angles are right angles (90°).
2. Opposite sides are equal and parallel.
3. Adjacent sides are perpendicular.

Since \( D E F G \) is a rectangle, we know:
- \( \angle E D F \) and \( \angle D F G \) are adjacent angles formed by the diagonal \( D F \).
- The sum of the measures of adjacent angles in a rectangle is 90° because they are part of the right angles at vertices \( D \) and \( F \).

#### Step 2: Setting Up the Equation
From the properties of a rectangle, we have:
\[
m \angle E D F + m \angle D F G = 90^\circ
\]
Substitute the given expressions for the angles:
\[
(5x - 3) + (3x + 7) = 90
\]

#### Step 3: Solving the Equation
Combine like terms:
\[
5x - 3 + 3x + 7 = 90
\]
\[
8x + 4 = 90
\]
Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[
8x = 86
\]
Divide by 8:
\[
x = \frac{86}{8} = 10.75
\]

#### Step 4: Finding \( m \angle E D F \)
Now, substitute \( x = 10.75 \) back into the expression for \( m \angle E D F \):
\[
m \angle E D F = 5x - 3
\]
\[
m \angle E D F = 5(10.75) - 3
\]
\[
m \angle E D F = 53.75 - 3
\]
\[
m \angle E D F = 50.75
\]

#### Step 5: Comparing with Answer Choices
The calculated value of \( m \angle E D F \) is 50.75. However, this value does not match any of the given answer choices (A. 22, B. 45, C. 68, D. 90). Upon re-evaluating the problem, it appears there might be a misunderstanding or error in the setup. Let us recheck the problem constraints and calculations.

### Reevaluation:
Upon rechecking, the setup and calculations are correct based on the given information. However, the answer choices suggest a potential misalignment with the problem's context. Since the problem specifies a rectangle and the angles must sum to 90°, the derived value of \( x = 10.75 \) and \( m \angle E D F = 50.75 \) are mathematically consistent but do not align with the provided options.

Given the instructions to select the closest answer choice, we must choose the option that is closest to 50.75. However, none of the options are close enough to justify selecting one. This indicates a possible issue with the problem's formulation or answer choices.

### Final Answer:
Since the problem's constraints and calculations are consistent, and the answer choices do not align with the derived result, we must conclude that the problem may have an error. However, based on the instructions to select the closest answer, the closest option is:

\boxed{C}
