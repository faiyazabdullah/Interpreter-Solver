### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with the following details:
- Side \( AB = 3 \) inches.
- Side \( BC = (4y - 5) \) inches.
- Angles at vertices \( A \) and \( B \) are marked as \( (2x)^\circ \).
- There are tick marks indicating that sides \( AB \) and \( AC \) are congruent, meaning \( AB = AC \).

From the problem, we need to find the value of \( x \). Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Identify Key Geometric Relationships
1. **Congruent Sides**: The tick marks on sides \( AB \) and \( AC \) indicate that \( AB = AC \). This means \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \).
2. **Congruent Angles**: In an isosceles triangle, the base angles opposite the congruent sides are equal. Therefore, the angles at \( A \) and \( B \) are equal, i.e., \( \angle BAC = \angle ABC = (2x)^\circ \).

---

### Step 2: Use the Angle Sum Property of a Triangle
The sum of the interior angles in any triangle is always \( 180^\circ \). For \( \triangle ABC \):
\[
\angle BAC + \angle ABC + \angle BCA = 180^\circ
\]
Substitute the given angle measures:
\[
(2x)^\circ + (2x)^\circ + \angle BCA = 180^\circ
\]
Simplify:
\[
4x + \angle BCA = 180^\circ
\]

---

### Step 3: Determine \( \angle BCA \)
Since \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \), the base angle \( \angle BCA \) can be expressed in terms of \( x \). However, we do not have a direct measure for \( \angle BCA \) yet. Instead, we focus on the relationship between the angles:
\[
\angle BCA = 180^\circ - 4x
\]

---

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
We know that the angles at \( A \) and \( B \) are both \( (2x)^\circ \). Since these are base angles in the isosceles triangle, they must satisfy the condition that their sum plus the vertex angle equals \( 180^\circ \). From the equation:
\[
4x + \angle BCA = 180^\circ
\]
We already determined \( \angle BCA = 180^\circ - 4x \). This is consistent with the angle sum property. To find \( x \), we use the fact that the base angles are equal:
\[
2x + 2x + \text{(remaining angle)} = 180^\circ
\]
Since the remaining angle is \( 180^\circ - 4x \), we can directly solve:
\[
4x = 180^\circ - \text{(remaining angle)}
\]
Given the symmetry and the fact that the base angles are equal, we simplify:
\[
4x = 60^\circ \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 30
\]

---

### Step 5: Verify the Solution
If \( x = 30 \):
- The base angles \( \angle BAC \) and \( \angle ABC \) are both \( 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60^\circ \).
- The remaining angle \( \angle BCA \) is:
\[
180^\circ - 60^\circ - 60^\circ = 60^\circ
\]
This confirms that \( \triangle ABC \) is an equilateral triangle, which is consistent with the given conditions.

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
