### Problem Analysis:
We are given two triangles, \( \triangle ABC \) and \( \triangle DEF \), which are similar (\( \triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF \)). We are also given specific measurements:
- \( BC = 30 \)
- \( BG \) (a median of \( \triangle ABC \)) = 15
- \( EF = 15 \)
- \( EH \) (a median of \( \triangle DEF \)) is unknown and needs to be determined.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Similar Triangles**: If two triangles are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional, and their corresponding medians are also proportional.
2. **Median of a Triangle**: A median divides a triangle into two smaller triangles of equal area and connects a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.
3. **Proportionality of Medians**: If \( \triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF \), then the ratio of the lengths of corresponding medians is the same as the ratio of the lengths of corresponding sides.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Understand the Similarity Ratio
Since \( \triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF \), the ratio of the corresponding sides of the triangles is:
\[
\frac{BC}{EF} = \frac{30}{15} = 2
\]
This means that every side of \( \triangle DEF \) is half the length of the corresponding side in \( \triangle ABC \).

#### Step 2: Proportionality of Medians
The medians of similar triangles are proportional to the sides of the triangles. Therefore, the ratio of the medians \( BG \) and \( EH \) is the same as the ratio of the corresponding sides:
\[
\frac{BG}{EH} = \frac{BC}{EF} = 2
\]

#### Step 3: Solve for \( EH \)
We know:
\[
BG = 15
\]
Using the proportionality:
\[
\frac{BG}{EH} = 2 \implies \frac{15}{EH} = 2
\]
Solving for \( EH \):
\[
EH = \frac{15}{2} = 7.5
\]

### Final Answer:
The length of \( EH \) is \( 7.5 \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 7.5
- B. 15
- C. 22.5
- D. 30

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]

### Final Answer: A
