### Problem Analysis:
We are given a geometric figure where \( F G H J \) is a kite. The goal is to find the measure of \( \angle G F J \). Let's analyze the image and the given information step by step.

#### **Given Information:**
1. \( F G H J \) is a kite.
2. \( \angle G = 128^\circ \).
3. \( \angle J = 72^\circ \).
4. The kite has symmetry, meaning the diagonals intersect at right angles, and one diagonal (the axis of symmetry) bisects the other.

#### **Key Properties of a Kite:**
- A kite has two pairs of adjacent sides that are equal.
- The diagonals of a kite intersect at right angles.
- One diagonal (the axis of symmetry) bisects the other diagonal.
- The angles between unequal sides are equal.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understanding the Kite Structure**
In a kite:
- The diagonals intersect at right angles.
- The longer diagonal (axis of symmetry) bisects the shorter diagonal.
- The angles between the unequal sides are equal.

From the image:
- \( \angle G = 128^\circ \) is one of the angles at the vertex where the unequal sides meet.
- \( \angle J = 72^\circ \) is the angle at the vertex where the equal sides meet.

#### **Step 2: Identifying Relevant Angles**
In a kite, the diagonals intersect at right angles. Therefore:
- The diagonal \( F J \) (longer diagonal) is the axis of symmetry and bisects the diagonal \( G H \).
- The diagonal \( G H \) is perpendicular to \( F J \).

#### **Step 3: Calculating \( \angle G F J \)**
To find \( \angle G F J \), we need to use the properties of the kite and the given angles.

1. **Sum of Angles in Quadrilateral \( F G H J \):**
   The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is \( 360^\circ \):
   \[
   \angle F + \angle G + \angle H + \angle J = 360^\circ
   \]
   Given:
   \[
   \angle G = 128^\circ, \quad \angle J = 72^\circ
   \]

2. **Symmetry and Equal Angles:**
   Since \( F G H J \) is a kite, the angles between the unequal sides are equal. Therefore:
   \[
   \angle F = \angle H
   \]

3. **Using the Sum of Angles:**
   Let \( \angle F = \angle H = x \). Then:
   \[
   x + 128^\circ + x + 72^\circ = 360^\circ
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   2x + 200^\circ = 360^\circ
   \]
   \[
   2x = 160^\circ
   \]
   \[
   x = 80^\circ
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   \angle F = 80^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \angle H = 80^\circ
   \]

4. **Finding \( \angle G F J \):**
   Since \( F J \) is the diagonal of the kite and it bisects \( \angle G \) and \( \angle H \) at right angles, we can use the fact that the diagonals intersect at right angles. The angle \( \angle G F J \) is part of the larger angle \( \angle G \).

   However, the problem asks for \( \angle G F J \), which is the angle formed by the intersection of the diagonals. Since the diagonals intersect at right angles, we need to consider the symmetry and the fact that \( \angle G F J \) is part of the larger angle \( \angle G \).

   Given the symmetry and the fact that the diagonals intersect at right angles, the angle \( \angle G F J \) is:
   \[
   \angle G F J = 80^\circ
   \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
