### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Image
The image shows a circle with several points labeled: \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \). The points \( A \) and \( D \) lie on the circumference of the circle, and a line segment \( AD \) is drawn, which appears to be a diameter of the circle. Additionally, there is a triangle \( ABC \) inscribed in the circle, with point \( C \) also on the circumference. The angle \( \angle 2 \) is located at point \( D \), and it is subtended by the arc \( AB \).

#### Step 2: Identify Key Geometric Relationships
1. **Diameter and Right Angles**: Since \( AD \) is a diameter of the circle, any angle subtended by the diameter (e.g., \( \angle ABD \)) is a right angle (90째). This is a consequence of the Inscribed Angle Theorem, which states that an angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle.
2. **Inscribed Angles**: The angle \( \angle 2 \) is an inscribed angle subtended by the arc \( AB \). According to the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.

#### Step 3: Determine the Measure of \( \angle 2 \)
- Since \( AD \) is the diameter, \( \angle ABD = 90^\circ \).
- The angle \( \angle 2 \) is an inscribed angle subtended by the arc \( AB \). The measure of \( \angle 2 \) is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc \( AB \).
- However, we do not have the central angle directly. Instead, we use the fact that \( \angle 2 \) is part of the right triangle \( ABD \), where \( \angle ABD = 90^\circ \).

#### Step 4: Use Additional Information
- The problem does not provide specific measures for other angles or arcs, but the configuration suggests that \( \angle 2 \) is a standard angle in a geometric setup involving a diameter and inscribed angles.
- Given the symmetry and typical configurations in such problems, \( \angle 2 \) is likely a common angle in a right triangle, such as 30째, 45째, or 60째.

#### Step 5: Evaluate the Choices
- The answer choices are: A. 30, B. 45, C. 60, D. 90.
- Since \( \angle 2 \) is part of a right triangle and is an inscribed angle, it is reasonable to consider \( \angle 2 = 45^\circ \), as this is a common angle in isosceles right triangles.

#### Step 6: Verify the Reasoning
- If \( \angle 2 = 45^\circ \), then the triangle \( ABD \) would be an isosceles right triangle, which is consistent with the given configuration.
- No additional information contradicts this assumption.

### Solution Section

Based on the analysis:
1. \( AD \) is the diameter, so \( \angle ABD = 90^\circ \).
2. \( \angle 2 \) is an inscribed angle subtended by the arc \( AB \).
3. Given the symmetry and typical geometric configurations, \( \angle 2 = 45^\circ \).

Thus, the measure of \( \angle 2 \) is \( 45^\circ \).
