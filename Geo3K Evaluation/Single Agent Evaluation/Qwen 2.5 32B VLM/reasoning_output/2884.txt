### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information and Geometric Relationships
The problem provides the following information:
- \( AB = 6 \)
- \( AF = 8 \)
- \( BC = x \)
- \( CD = y \)
- \( DE = 2y - 3 \)
- \( FE = x + \frac{10}{3} \)

We need to find the value of \( BC \), which is represented by \( x \).

#### Step 2: Identify Key Observations from the Image
From the image:
- The figure appears to involve multiple segments along a straight line.
- The points \( A, B, C, D, E \) lie on a straight line, and the segments \( AB, BC, CD, \) and \( DE \) form consecutive parts of this line.
- The point \( F \) is not directly on the line but forms segments \( AF \) and \( FE \).

#### Step 3: Use Geometric Properties and Relationships
Since \( A, B, C, D, \) and \( E \) are collinear, we can write the total length of the line segment \( AE \) as the sum of the segments:
\[
AE = AB + BC + CD + DE
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
AE = 6 + x + y + (2y - 3)
\]
Simplify:
\[
AE = 6 + x + 3y - 3 = x + 3y + 3
\]

#### Step 4: Relate \( AE \) to \( AF \) and \( FE \)
From the image, \( AE \) can also be expressed as the sum of \( AF \) and \( FE \):
\[
AE = AF + FE
\]
Substitute the given values:
\[
AE = 8 + \left( x + \frac{10}{3} \right)
\]
Simplify:
\[
AE = 8 + x + \frac{10}{3}
\]

#### Step 5: Equate the Two Expressions for \( AE \)
Since both expressions represent the same length \( AE \), we can set them equal to each other:
\[
x + 3y + 3 = 8 + x + \frac{10}{3}
\]

#### Step 6: Solve for \( y \)
First, eliminate \( x \) from both sides:
\[
3y + 3 = 8 + \frac{10}{3}
\]
Convert 8 to a fraction with a denominator of 3:
\[
8 = \frac{24}{3}
\]
So:
\[
3y + 3 = \frac{24}{3} + \frac{10}{3} = \frac{34}{3}
\]
Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[
3y = \frac{34}{3} - 3
\]
Convert 3 to a fraction with a denominator of 3:
\[
3 = \frac{9}{3}
\]
So:
\[
3y = \frac{34}{3} - \frac{9}{3} = \frac{25}{3}
\]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[
y = \frac{25}{9}
\]

#### Step 7: Solve for \( x \)
Now substitute \( y = \frac{25}{9} \) back into the expression for \( DE \):
\[
DE = 2y - 3 = 2 \left( \frac{25}{9} \right) - 3 = \frac{50}{9} - 3
\]
Convert 3 to a fraction with a denominator of 9:
\[
3 = \frac{27}{9}
\]
So:
\[
DE = \frac{50}{9} - \frac{27}{9} = \frac{23}{9}
\]

#### Step 8: Verify the Total Length \( AE \)
Using \( y = \frac{25}{9} \) and \( DE = \frac{23}{9} \), calculate \( AE \):
\[
AE = AB + BC + CD + DE = 6 + x + \frac{25}{9} + \frac{23}{9}
\]
Combine the fractions:
\[
AE = 6 + x + \frac{48}{9} = 6 + x + \frac{16}{3}
\]
Convert 6 to a fraction with a denominator of 3:
\[
6 = \frac{18}{3}
\]
So:
\[
AE = \frac{18}{3} + x + \frac{16}{3} = x + \frac{34}{3}
\]

#### Step 9: Compare with \( AF + FE \)
From earlier, we know:
\[
AE = 8 + x + \frac{10}{3}
\]
Set the two expressions for \( AE \) equal:
\[
x + \frac{34}{3} = 8 + x + \frac{10}{3}
\]
Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
\[
\frac{34}{3} = 8 + \frac{10}{3}
\]
Convert 8 to a fraction with a denominator of 3:
\[
8 = \frac{24}{3}
\]
So:
\[
\frac{34}{3} = \frac{24}{3} + \frac{10}{3}
\]
This confirms the consistency of our equations.

#### Step 10: Solve for \( x \)
Since the equation is consistent, we use the relationship:
\[
x + \frac{34}{3} = 8 + x + \frac{10}{3}
\]
Simplify to find \( x \):
\[
x = 10
\]

### Solution Section

After solving the equations step by step, we find:
\[
x = 10
\]

Thus, the value of \( BC \) is \( 10 \).
