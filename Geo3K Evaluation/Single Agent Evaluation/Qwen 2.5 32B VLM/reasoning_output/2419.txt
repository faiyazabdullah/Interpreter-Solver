### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a circle with a rectangle inscribed inside it. The rectangle has sides labeled as 8 inches and 6 inches. The goal is to find the exact circumference of the circle.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Inscribed Rectangle**: The rectangle is inscribed in the circle, meaning all four vertices of the rectangle touch the circumference of the circle.
2. **Diagonal of the Rectangle**: The diagonal of the rectangle will be the diameter of the circle because the diagonal of an inscribed rectangle spans the diameter of the circle.
3. **Given Dimensions**: The sides of the rectangle are 8 inches and 6 inches.
4. **Circle's Circumference Formula**: The circumference \( C \) of a circle is given by \( C = \pi d \), where \( d \) is the diameter of the circle.

### Thought Section:
#### Step 1: Identify the Relationship Between the Rectangle and the Circle
- Since the rectangle is inscribed in the circle, the diagonal of the rectangle is equal to the diameter of the circle.
- We need to calculate the length of the diagonal of the rectangle using the Pythagorean theorem.

#### Step 2: Calculate the Diagonal of the Rectangle
- The diagonal \( d \) of a rectangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:
  \[
  d = \sqrt{\text{(length)}^2 + \text{(width)}^2}
  \]
- Here, the length is 8 inches and the width is 6 inches:
  \[
  d = \sqrt{8^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{64 + 36} = \sqrt{100} = 10 \text{ inches}
  \]
- Therefore, the diameter of the circle is 10 inches.

#### Step 3: Calculate the Circumference of the Circle
- The circumference \( C \) of a circle is given by:
  \[
  C = \pi d
  \]
- Substituting the diameter \( d = 10 \) inches:
  \[
  C = \pi \times 10 = 10\pi
  \]

#### Step 4: Compare with Answer Choices
- The calculated circumference is \( 10\pi \).
- The answer choices are:
  - A. \( 8\pi \)
  - B. \( 10\pi \)
  - C. \( 16\pi \)
  - D. \( 20\pi \)

#### Step 5: Select the Correct Answer
- The calculated value \( 10\pi \) matches exactly with answer choice B.

### Solution Section:
The circumference of the circle is \( 10\pi \).
