### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the value of \( x \) in trapezoid \( QRST \), given that trapezoid \( JKLM \) is similar to trapezoid \( QRST \). The areas of the two trapezoids are provided, along with a side length in trapezoid \( JKLM \).

#### Given Information:
1. **Area of trapezoid \( JKLM \)**: \( 138 \) square feet.
2. **Area of trapezoid \( QRST \)**: \( 5.52 \) square feet.
3. **Side \( JK \) in trapezoid \( JKLM \)**: \( 5 \) feet.
4. **Trapezoid \( JKLM \sim QRST \)**: This implies that the trapezoids are similar, and their corresponding sides are proportional.

#### Objective:
Find the value of \( x \), which represents the corresponding side in trapezoid \( QRST \) that is proportional to side \( JK \) in trapezoid \( JKLM \).

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Understand Similarity and Area Ratio
When two figures are similar, the ratio of their areas is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths. Mathematically:
\[
\text{Ratio of Areas} = \left( \frac{\text{Corresponding Side of } QRST}{\text{Corresponding Side of } JKLM} \right)^2
\]

Let the corresponding side in trapezoid \( QRST \) (i.e., \( x \)) be related to side \( JK \) in trapezoid \( JKLM \). Then:
\[
\frac{\text{Area of } QRST}{\text{Area of } JKLM} = \left( \frac{x}{JK} \right)^2
\]

#### Step 2: Substitute Known Values
From the problem:
- Area of \( QRST \) = \( 5.52 \) square feet.
- Area of \( JKLM \) = \( 138 \) square feet.
- Side \( JK \) = \( 5 \) feet.

Substitute these values into the area ratio formula:
\[
\frac{5.52}{138} = \left( \frac{x}{5} \right)^2
\]

#### Step 3: Simplify the Area Ratio
Calculate the left-hand side:
\[
\frac{5.52}{138} = 0.04
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
0.04 = \left( \frac{x}{5} \right)^2
\]

#### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
Take the square root of both sides:
\[
\sqrt{0.04} = \frac{x}{5}
\]
\[
0.2 = \frac{x}{5}
\]

Multiply both sides by 5:
\[
x = 0.2 \times 5 = 1
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the Solution
Check the consistency of the solution:
- If \( x = 1 \), then the ratio of the corresponding sides is \( \frac{x}{JK} = \frac{1}{5} \).
- The square of this ratio is \( \left( \frac{1}{5} \right)^2 = 0.04 \), which matches the area ratio \( \frac{5.52}{138} \).

The solution is consistent with the given information.
