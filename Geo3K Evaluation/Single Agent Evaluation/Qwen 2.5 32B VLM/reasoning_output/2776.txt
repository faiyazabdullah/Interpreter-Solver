### Problem Analysis:
The given problem involves a rectangle \(ABCD\) with additional lines and marked angles. We are tasked with finding the measure of \(\angle 8\) given that \(\angle 2 = 40^\circ\).

#### Step 1: Identify the given information
- Quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is a rectangle.
- \(\angle 2 = 40^\circ\).
- The figure includes additional lines and angles, specifically focusing on \(\angle 8\).

#### Step 2: Understand the properties of a rectangle
- All interior angles of a rectangle are right angles (\(90^\circ\)).
- Opposite sides are parallel.
- Diagonals bisect each other.

#### Step 3: Analyze the relationship between \(\angle 2\) and \(\angle 8\)
- \(\angle 2\) is located at vertex \(A\) and is part of the triangle formed by the diagonal \(AC\) and the side \(AB\).
- \(\angle 8\) is located at the intersection of the diagonal \(AC\) and the line segment \(BD\), forming part of the triangle involving these segments.

#### Step 4: Use geometric properties to find relationships
1. **Identify \(\angle 2\):**
   - Since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, \(\angle BAC = \angle 2 = 40^\circ\).
   - The diagonal \(AC\) divides the rectangle into two congruent right triangles, \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ADC\).

2. **Use the property of diagonals in a rectangle:**
   - The diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other. Therefore, point \(E\) (where the diagonals intersect) is the midpoint of both diagonals.
   - This implies that \(\angle 8\) is related to the angles formed by the diagonals.

3. **Analyze \(\angle 8\):**
   - \(\angle 8\) is part of the triangle formed by the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\).
   - Since the diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other, the angles around point \(E\) are related by symmetry.
   - Specifically, \(\angle 8\) is the angle supplementary to \(\angle 2\) because they form a linear pair along the diagonal \(AC\).

4. **Calculate \(\angle 8\):**
   - In the triangle involving the diagonals, \(\angle 8\) is the angle adjacent to \(\angle 2\) on the straight line formed by the diagonal \(AC\).
   - Therefore, \(\angle 8 = 180^\circ - \angle 2\).
   - Substituting \(\angle 2 = 40^\circ\):
     \[
     \angle 8 = 180^\circ - 40^\circ = 140^\circ
     \]

#### Step 5: Reassess the interpretation
- Upon re-examining the problem, it appears there might be a misunderstanding in the initial interpretation. The correct approach involves recognizing that \(\angle 8\) is not directly supplementary to \(\angle 2\) but rather part of a different geometric relationship.
- Instead, \(\angle 8\) is the angle formed by the diagonals, which are perpendicular in a rectangle. However, the specific angle relationship here is more directly related to the symmetry and the fact that \(\angle 8\) is an alternate interior angle to \(\angle 2\) due to the parallel sides of the rectangle.

#### Correct Approach:
- \(\angle 8\) is actually the angle that is vertically opposite to \(\angle 2\) in the context of the diagonals' intersection.
- Therefore, \(\angle 8 = \angle 2 = 40^\circ\).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
