### Problem Analysis:
The image depicts a geometric figure involving a circle and several tangent segments. Here's a breakdown of the given information:

1. **Circle and Tangents**:
   - There is a circle with center \( O \).
   - Segments \( AC \), \( CD \), \( DB \), and \( AE \) are tangent to the circle at points \( C \), \( D \), \( E \), and \( F \), respectively.
   - The lengths of some tangents are given:
     - \( AE = 8 \)
     - \( DB = 8 \)
     - \( CD = 6 \)

2. **Objective**:
   - We need to find the length of segment \( x \), which represents \( AB \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand Tangent Properties**
One of the key properties of tangents to a circle is that **tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length**. This means:
- If \( P \) is an external point and \( PA \) and \( PB \) are tangents to the circle, then \( PA = PB \).

#### **Step 2: Apply Tangent Properties**
From the diagram:
- \( AE \) and \( AF \) are tangents from point \( A \). Therefore, \( AE = AF = 8 \).
- \( DB \) and \( DE \) are tangents from point \( B \). Therefore, \( DB = DE = 8 \).
- \( CD \) is a segment connecting points of tangency, and its length is given as 6.

#### **Step 3: Express \( AB \) in Terms of Known Lengths**
To find \( AB \), we need to consider the entire path from \( A \) to \( B \) along the tangents:
- \( AB = AF + FE + ED + DB \).

However, since \( F \) and \( E \) are points of tangency, the segments \( AF \) and \( DE \) are part of the tangents from \( A \) and \( B \), respectively. Thus:
- \( AF = AE = 8 \)
- \( DE = DB = 8 \)

The segment \( FE \) is part of the circle's circumference and is not directly measurable from the given information. Instead, we focus on the total length of the tangents.

#### **Step 4: Calculate \( AB \)**
Since \( AF = 8 \) and \( DE = 8 \), and \( CD = 6 \) is the internal segment between the points of tangency:
- The total length \( AB \) is the sum of the external tangents and the internal segment:
  \[
  AB = AF + FE + ED + DB = AE + CD + DB
  \]
  Substituting the known values:
  \[
  AB = 8 + 6 + 8 = 22
  \]

However, upon re-evaluating the problem, it appears there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of \( x \). The question asks for \( x \), which is likely the length of \( AB \) directly, not the sum of all segments. Given the symmetry and the properties of tangents, the correct interpretation is that \( AB \) is simply the sum of the external tangents from \( A \) and \( B \) minus the internal segment \( CD \).

#### **Step 5: Revisit the Diagram**
Given the symmetry and the fact that \( AE = AF = 8 \) and \( DB = DE = 8 \), the correct interpretation is:
\[
AB = AE + DB = 8 + 8 = 16
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
