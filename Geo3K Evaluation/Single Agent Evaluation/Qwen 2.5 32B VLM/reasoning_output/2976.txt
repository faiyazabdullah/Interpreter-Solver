### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the measure of $\angle 2$ in the given geometric figure. Let's analyze the image step by step:

1. **Identify Given Information:**
   - $\angle D = 32^\circ$
   - $\angle GCB = 23^\circ$
   - $\angle EAB = 22^\circ$
   - Points $A$, $B$, and $C$ lie on a straight line (implying $\angle GCB + \angle ABC = 180^\circ$).
   - Points $D$, $E$, and $F$ form a triangle with $\angle D$ and $\angle EAB$ as exterior angles to some internal angles.

2. **Understand the Relationships:**
   - Since $A$, $B$, and $C$ are collinear, $\angle GCB$ and $\angle ABC$ are supplementary.
   - $\angle 2$ is part of the triangle formed by points $D$, $E$, and $F$, and it is related to $\angle D$ and $\angle EAB$ through the properties of exterior angles and parallel lines.

3. **Key Geometric Principles:**
   - **Exterior Angle Theorem:** The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.
   - **Supplementary Angles:** Angles on a straight line add up to $180^\circ$.
   - **Parallel Lines and Transversals:** If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and consecutive interior angles have specific relationships.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze the Straight Line at Point $B$
- Since $A$, $B$, and $C$ are collinear, $\angle GCB$ and $\angle ABC$ are supplementary:
  $$
  \angle GCB + \angle ABC = 180^\circ
  $$
  Substituting the given value:
  $$
  23^\circ + \angle ABC = 180^\circ \implies \angle ABC = 157^\circ
  $$

#### Step 2: Focus on Triangle $DEF$
- $\angle D = 32^\circ$ is an interior angle of $\triangle DEF$.
- $\angle EAB = 22^\circ$ is an exterior angle to $\triangle DEF$ at vertex $E$. By the Exterior Angle Theorem, $\angle EAB$ is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles of $\triangle DEF$:
  $$
  \angle EAB = \angle D + \angle 2
  $$
  Substituting the known values:
  $$
  22^\circ = 32^\circ + \angle 2
  $$
  Solving for $\angle 2$:
  $$
  \angle 2 = 22^\circ - 32^\circ = -10^\circ
  $$

#### Step 3: Reassess and Correct Approach
- Upon re-examining the problem, we realize that $\angle 2$ is actually part of the triangle formed by extending lines and considering the angles around point $B$.
- The correct approach involves using the fact that $\angle 2$ is part of the linear pair with $\angle ABC$ and the relationship between the angles in the triangle.

#### Step 4: Use Supplementary Angles and Linear Pairs
- Since $\angle ABC = 157^\circ$, the angle adjacent to $\angle 2$ (denoted as $\angle 1$) is:
  $$
  \angle 1 = 180^\circ - \angle ABC = 180^\circ - 157^\circ = 23^\circ
  $$
- In $\triangle DEF$, $\angle 2$ is part of the triangle and can be found using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is $180^\circ$. However, the key is to use the relationship with $\angle D$ and $\angle EAB$:
  $$
  \angle 2 = 180^\circ - (\angle D + \angle EAB)
  $$
  Substituting the known values:
  $$
  \angle 2 = 180^\circ - (32^\circ + 22^\circ) = 180^\circ - 54^\circ = 126^\circ
  $$

#### Step 5: Correct Interpretation
- Upon further review, the correct interpretation is that $\angle 2$ is directly related to the angles around point $B$ and the linear pair relationship. The correct calculation should be:
  $$
  \angle 2 = 180^\circ - (\angle D + \angle EAB) = 180^\circ - (32^\circ + 22^\circ) = 126^\circ
  $$

### Final Answer:
After re-evaluating the problem, the correct measure of $\angle 2$ is:
$$
\boxed{D}
$$
