### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a geometric figure involving a circle and several labeled points and segments. Here's a breakdown of the given information:

1. **Circle**: The figure includes a circle with several points marked on its circumference.
2. **Segments**:
   - Segment \( DA \) is labeled as \( x \).
   - Segment \( DC \) is labeled as 9.
   - Segment \( CE \) is labeled as 12.25.
   - Segment \( AG \) is labeled as 24.
3. **Points**:
   - Points \( D, A, B, C, E, G \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
   - Point \( E \) appears to be the intersection of chords within the circle.
   - The problem likely involves properties of intersecting chords or similar triangles.

### Key Geometric Concepts:
To solve for \( x \), we need to leverage the **Power of a Point Theorem** or **Intersecting Chords Theorem**, which states:
\[
AD \cdot DB = CD \cdot DE
\]
where \( D \) is the point of intersection of two chords \( AB \) and \( CE \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify Relevant Segments
From the image:
- \( AD = x \)
- \( DB = AG = 24 \) (since \( D, B, G \) are collinear and \( B \) lies between \( D \) and \( G \)).
- \( CD = 9 \)
- \( DE = CE + EC' \), but since \( E \) is the intersection point, we use the total segment \( CE = 12.25 \).

Thus, the intersecting chords theorem becomes:
\[
AD \cdot DB = CD \cdot DE
\]

#### Step 2: Apply the Power of a Point Theorem
Substitute the known values into the equation:
\[
x \cdot 24 = 9 \cdot 12.25
\]

#### Step 3: Calculate the Right-Hand Side
Calculate \( 9 \cdot 12.25 \):
\[
9 \cdot 12.25 = 110.25
\]

So the equation becomes:
\[
x \cdot 24 = 110.25
\]

#### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
Divide both sides by 24:
\[
x = \frac{110.25}{24}
\]

Perform the division:
\[
x = 4.59375
\]

#### Step 5: Round to the Nearest Tenth
Rounding \( 4.59375 \) to the nearest tenth gives:
\[
x \approx 4.6
\]

#### Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated value \( x \approx 4.6 \) does not match any of the provided answer choices (A: 3, B: 9, C: 12.25, D: 24). However, based on the instructions, we must select the closest option.

### Final Answer:
The closest value to \( 4.6 \) among the given choices is **9** (Option B).

\[
\boxed{B}
\]

### Final Answer: B
