### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Image
The image shows a circle with a regular hexagon inscribed in it. The hexagon is divided into six equilateral triangles, and each side of the hexagon is tangent to the circle at its midpoint. The shaded region appears to be the area of the circle minus the area of the hexagon.

- **Key Observations:**
  - The circle has a radius \( r \).
  - The hexagon is regular, meaning all sides and angles are equal.
  - The central angle subtended by each side of the hexagon is \( 60^\circ \) (since \( 360^\circ / 6 = 60^\circ \)).
  - The distance from the center of the circle to the midpoint of any side of the hexagon is the radius \( r \).

#### Step 2: Identify Given Information
- The problem states that the shaded region's area is to be found.
- The number "21" is marked near the center of the circle, which likely represents the radius \( r = 21 \) of the circle.

#### Step 3: Determine What Needs to Be Found
We need to find the area of the shaded region, which is the area of the circle minus the area of the hexagon.

#### Step 4: Apply Relevant Geometric Formulas
1. **Area of the Circle:**
   \[
   \text{Area of the Circle} = \pi r^2
   \]
   Here, \( r = 21 \).

2. **Area of the Hexagon:**
   - A regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles.
   - The side length of each equilateral triangle is equal to the radius \( r \) of the circle.
   - The area of one equilateral triangle with side length \( s \) is given by:
     \[
     \text{Area of one equilateral triangle} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2
     \]
   - Since \( s = r = 21 \), the area of one equilateral triangle is:
     \[
     \text{Area of one equilateral triangle} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 21^2
     \]
   - The total area of the hexagon is 6 times the area of one equilateral triangle:
     \[
     \text{Area of the Hexagon} = 6 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 21^2
     \]

3. **Area of the Shaded Region:**
   \[
   \text{Area of the Shaded Region} = \text{Area of the Circle} - \text{Area of the Hexagon}
   \]

#### Step 5: Perform Calculations
1. **Area of the Circle:**
   \[
   \text{Area of the Circle} = \pi \times 21^2 = \pi \times 441 \approx 3.14159 \times 441 \approx 1385.44
   \]

2. **Area of One Equilateral Triangle:**
   \[
   \text{Area of one equilateral triangle} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 21^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 441 \approx \frac{1.732}{4} \times 441 \approx 0.433 \times 441 \approx 190.37
   \]

3. **Area of the Hexagon:**
   \[
   \text{Area of the Hexagon} = 6 \times 190.37 \approx 1142.22
   \]

4. **Area of the Shaded Region:**
   \[
   \text{Area of the Shaded Region} = 1385.44 - 1142.22 \approx 243.22
   \]

#### Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated area of the shaded region is approximately \( 243.22 \). However, this does not match any of the provided answer choices. Let us recheck the calculations and assumptions.

#### Step 7: Reassess and Refine
Upon rechecking, the calculations appear correct. The discrepancy might arise from the interpretation of the problem or the provided answer choices. Given the constraints, we must select the closest answer choice to our calculated value.

### Solution Section

Based on the calculations:
- Area of the Circle: \( 1385.44 \)
- Area of the Hexagon: \( 1142.22 \)
- Area of the Shaded Region: \( 243.22 \)

However, none of the provided answer choices (A. 216.6, B. 282.9, C. 464.8, D. 819.6) closely match \( 243.22 \). The closest choice is **B. 282.9**.
