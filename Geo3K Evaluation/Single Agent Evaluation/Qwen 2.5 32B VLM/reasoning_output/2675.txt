### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a circle with a central angle labeled as \(102^\circ\) subtended by the arc \(BC\). Points \(B\) and \(C\) lie on the circumference of the circle, and there are tangent segments at points \(D\) and \(E\) that meet at point \(F\). The angle \( \angle 1 \) is formed at point \(F\) between the tangents.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Central Angle**: The central angle \( \angle BOC = 102^\circ \), where \(O\) is the center of the circle.
2. **Tangents**: Segments \(BD\) and \(CE\) are tangent to the circle at points \(D\) and \(E\), respectively.
3. **Angle Formed by Tangents**: The angle \( \angle 1 \) (at point \(F\)) is formed by the intersection of the tangents at points \(D\) and \(E\).

### Thought Section:
#### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry of Tangents
- When two tangents are drawn to a circle from an external point, the angle formed by these tangents is related to the intercepted arc.
- Specifically, the measure of the angle formed by two tangents is given by:
  \[
  \text{Measure of } \angle 1 = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{Measure of the intercepted arc})
  \]
  Here, the intercepted arc is \(BC\), which corresponds to the central angle \( \angle BOC = 102^\circ \).

#### Step 2: Applying the Tangent-Secant Theorem
- The intercepted arc \(BC\) is directly related to the central angle \( \angle BOC \).
- Therefore, the measure of \( \angle 1 \) can be calculated as:
  \[
  \angle 1 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Measure of the intercepted arc}
  \]
  Since the intercepted arc \(BC\) is subtended by the central angle \(102^\circ\), we have:
  \[
  \angle 1 = \frac{1}{2} \times 102^\circ
  \]

#### Step 3: Performing the Calculation
- Simplify the expression:
  \[
  \angle 1 = \frac{102^\circ}{2} = 51^\circ
  \]

#### Step 4: Verifying the Result
- The formula used is consistent with the properties of tangents to a circle. The angle formed by two tangents is indeed half the measure of the intercepted arc.
- The calculation is straightforward and aligns with the given data.

### Solution Section:
Based on the above reasoning, the measure of \( \angle 1 \) is:
\[
\angle 1 = 51^\circ
\]

Comparing this result with the given answer choices:
- A. 51
- B. 78
- C. 102
- D. 129

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
