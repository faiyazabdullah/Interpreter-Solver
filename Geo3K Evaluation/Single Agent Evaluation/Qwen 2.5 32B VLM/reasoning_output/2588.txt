### Problem Analysis:
We are given a geometric figure with labeled angles and some relationships between them. The specific information provided is:
- \( m\angle 3 = x - 12 \)
- \( m\angle 6 = 72 \)

We need to find the value of \( x \). To do this, we must analyze the relationships between the angles in the figure, particularly focusing on how \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 6 \) are related.

#### Step 1: Identify Relationships Between Angles
From the image:
- \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 6 \) are **corresponding angles** because they are formed by the intersection of the transversal line \( AB \) with the parallel lines \( EF \) and \( GD \).
- Corresponding angles are congruent when the lines are parallel. Therefore, \( m\angle 3 = m\angle 6 \).

#### Step 2: Use the Given Information
We are given:
- \( m\angle 6 = 72 \)
- \( m\angle 3 = x - 12 \)

Since \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 6 \) are corresponding angles, we can set up the equation:
\[
m\angle 3 = m\angle 6
\]
Substitute the given values:
\[
x - 12 = 72
\]

#### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
Solve the equation \( x - 12 = 72 \):
\[
x = 72 + 12
\]
\[
x = 84
\]

#### Step 4: Verify the Solution
- If \( x = 84 \), then \( m\angle 3 = x - 12 = 84 - 12 = 72 \).
- This matches the given \( m\angle 6 = 72 \), confirming that our solution is consistent with the properties of corresponding angles.

### Final Answer:
The value of \( x \) is \( 84 \).
