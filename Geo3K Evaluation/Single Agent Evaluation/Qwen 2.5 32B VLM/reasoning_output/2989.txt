### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Image and Identify Given Information
- **Left Figure**: A quadrilateral (specifically a rhombus) with side length \(40 \, \text{mm}\) and area \(400 \, \text{mm}^2\).
- **Right Figure**: A smaller, similar quadrilateral (rhombus) with side length \(x \, \text{mm}\) and area \(64 \, \text{mm}^2\).

#### Step 2: Understand the Problem
We need to find the value of \(x\) for the smaller rhombus. Since the two figures are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional, and the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths.

#### Step 3: Recall Relevant Geometric Properties
- For similar figures, the ratio of their areas is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths.
  \[
  \frac{\text{Area of smaller figure}}{\text{Area of larger figure}} = \left( \frac{\text{Side of smaller figure}}{\text{Side of larger figure}} \right)^2
  \]

#### Step 4: Set Up the Proportion
Let the side length of the smaller rhombus be \(x \, \text{mm}\). The side length of the larger rhombus is \(40 \, \text{mm}\). The areas are given as \(64 \, \text{mm}^2\) and \(400 \, \text{mm}^2\), respectively. Using the property of similar figures:
\[
\frac{64}{400} = \left( \frac{x}{40} \right)^2
\]

#### Step 5: Solve for \(x\)
1. Simplify the left-hand side:
   \[
   \frac{64}{400} = \frac{4}{25}
   \]
   So the equation becomes:
   \[
   \frac{4}{25} = \left( \frac{x}{40} \right)^2
   \]

2. Take the square root of both sides:
   \[
   \sqrt{\frac{4}{25}} = \frac{x}{40}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2}{5} = \frac{x}{40}
   \]

3. Solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x = \frac{2}{5} \times 40 = \frac{80}{5} = 16
   \]

#### Step 6: Verify the Solution
- The side length of the smaller rhombus is \(x = 16 \, \text{mm}\).
- Check the area ratio:
  \[
  \left( \frac{16}{40} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{2}{5} \right)^2 = \frac{4}{25}
  \]
  \[
  \frac{64}{400} = \frac{4}{25}
  \]
  The calculations are consistent.

#### Step 7: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated value of \(x\) is \(16\). This matches option B.

### Solution Section

The value of \(x\) is \(16\). Therefore, the correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{B}
\]
