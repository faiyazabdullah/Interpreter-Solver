### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the measure of the arc \( \widehat{AC} \) in the circle \(\odot O\). The given information includes:
1. \( EC \) and \( AB \) are diameters of the circle.
2. \( \angle BOD \cong \angle DOE \cong \angle EOF \cong \angle FOA \).
3. The circle is divided into equal angular segments by these angles.

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Circle and Angles:**
   - Since \( EC \) and \( AB \) are diameters, they pass through the center \( O \) and divide the circle into two equal halves.
   - The circle is a complete \(360^\circ\) shape, and the center \( O \) is the origin of all angles.

2. **Equal Angular Segments:**
   - The problem states that \( \angle BOD \cong \angle DOE \cong \angle EOF \cong \angle FOA \). This means the circle is divided into four equal central angles.
   - Each central angle is therefore:
     \[
     \frac{360^\circ}{4} = 90^\circ.
     \]

3. **Identifying Arcs:**
   - Each central angle corresponds to an arc on the circumference of the circle. Since the central angles are equal, the arcs subtended by these angles are also equal.
   - Specifically, \( \angle BOD \), \( \angle DOE \), \( \angle EOF \), and \( \angle FOA \) each correspond to arcs \( \widehat{BD} \), \( \widehat{DE} \), \( \widehat{EF} \), and \( \widehat{FA} \), respectively.

4. **Finding \( \widehat{AC} \):**
   - The arc \( \widehat{AC} \) is composed of two adjacent arcs: \( \widehat{AF} \) and \( \widehat{FC} \).
   - From the diagram, we observe that \( \widehat{AF} \) and \( \widehat{FC} \) are each subtended by a central angle of \( 90^\circ \).
   - Therefore, the total measure of \( \widehat{AC} \) is:
     \[
     m\widehat{AC} = m\widehat{AF} + m\widehat{FC} = 90^\circ + 90^\circ = 180^\circ.
     \]

5. **Verification:**
   - The diameters \( EC \) and \( AB \) divide the circle into two semicircles, each measuring \( 180^\circ \).
   - Since \( \widehat{AC} \) spans from \( A \) to \( C \) along the semicircle defined by diameter \( AB \), its measure is indeed \( 180^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
