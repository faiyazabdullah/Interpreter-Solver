### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
- The image shows a complex geometric figure involving multiple triangles and intersecting lines.
- Key angles are labeled:
  - \( \angle D = 75^\circ \)
  - \( \angle B = 35^\circ \)
  - \( \angle C = 28^\circ \)
- We need to find \( m\angle 1 \), which is the angle at point \( E \) formed by the intersection of the lines \( BD \) and \( CA \).

#### Step 2: Identify Relevant Geometric Relationships
- The figure involves multiple triangles, specifically \( \triangle BCD \) and \( \triangle ABC \).
- Since \( E \) is the intersection point of \( BD \) and \( CA \), we can use the properties of angles formed by intersecting lines and the sum of angles in a triangle.

#### Step 3: Calculate \( \angle BDC \) in \( \triangle BCD \)
- In \( \triangle BCD \):
  - The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is \( 180^\circ \).
  - Therefore, \( \angle BDC + \angle DBC + \angle BCD = 180^\circ \).
  - Substituting the known values:
    \[
    \angle BDC + 35^\circ + 28^\circ = 180^\circ
    \]
    \[
    \angle BDC = 180^\circ - 63^\circ = 117^\circ
    \]

#### Step 4: Use the Exterior Angle Theorem
- \( \angle 1 \) is an exterior angle for \( \triangle BDE \) at vertex \( E \).
- According to the Exterior Angle Theorem, the measure of an exterior angle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.
- In \( \triangle BDE \):
  - The two non-adjacent interior angles are \( \angle DBE \) and \( \angle BDE \).
  - From the previous step, \( \angle BDE = 117^\circ \).
  - \( \angle DBE \) is part of \( \triangle BCD \) and is given as \( 35^\circ \).

#### Step 5: Calculate \( m\angle 1 \)
- Using the Exterior Angle Theorem:
  \[
  m\angle 1 = \angle DBE + \angle BDE
  \]
  \[
  m\angle 1 = 35^\circ + 28^\circ = 63^\circ
  \]

#### Step 6: Verify and Compare with Answer Choices
- The calculated value of \( m\angle 1 \) is \( 63^\circ \).
- However, upon re-evaluating the problem, it appears there might be a misinterpretation. Let's revisit the problem and consider the possibility of \( \angle 1 \) being related to the angles in \( \triangle ABC \).

#### Step 7: Re-evaluate the Problem
- Upon closer inspection, \( \angle 1 \) is actually the angle formed by the intersection of \( BD \) and \( CA \). This angle is the supplement of the angle formed by the extension of \( BD \) and \( CA \).
- The correct approach is to use the fact that \( \angle 1 \) is the supplement of the angle formed by the extension of \( BD \) and \( CA \):
  \[
  m\angle 1 = 180^\circ - (\angle BDE + \angle BCA)
  \]
  \[
  m\angle 1 = 180^\circ - (117^\circ + 28^\circ) = 180^\circ - 145^\circ = 35^\circ
  \]

#### Step 8: Final Verification
- The correct interpretation and calculation show that \( m\angle 1 = 35^\circ \).
