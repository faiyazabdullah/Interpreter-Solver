### Problem Analysis:
The given image depicts a triangle \( \triangle QRS \) with a circle inscribed within it. The points \( U, V, T \) are the points of tangency of the incircle with the sides \( QR, RS, \) and \( QS \), respectively. The center of the incircle is labeled \( W \). The lengths of the segments are provided as follows:
- \( QT = 2x \)
- \( TS = 17 \) inches
- \( QU = 14 \) inches
- \( RV = 27 \) inches

We are tasked with finding the value of \( x \).

### Thought Section:
1. **Understanding the Geometry**:
   - The incircle touches the sides of the triangle at points \( U, V, \) and \( T \).
   - The segments from a vertex to the points of tangency on the opposite side are equal. For example:
     - \( QU = QV \)
     - \( RU = RT \)
     - \( VS = VT \)

2. **Applying Tangent-Segment Theorem**:
   - Since \( QU = QV \), we have \( QV = 14 \) inches.
   - Since \( RV = 27 \) inches, and \( RU = RT \), we can express \( RT \) as \( RT = RV - QU = 27 - 14 = 13 \) inches.
   - Therefore, \( RT = 13 \) inches.

3. **Expressing Side Lengths**:
   - The total length of side \( QS \) is the sum of \( QT \) and \( TS \):
     \[
     QS = QT + TS = 2x + 17
     \]
   - The total length of side \( QR \) is the sum of \( QU \) and \( UR \):
     \[
     QR = QU + UR = 14 + 13 = 27
     \]
   - The total length of side \( RS \) is the sum of \( RV \) and \( VS \):
     \[
     RS = RV + VS = 27 + 17 = 44
     \]

4. **Using the Tangent-Segment Theorem for \( VS \)**:
   - Since \( VS = VT \), and \( VT = TS = 17 \) inches, we have:
     \[
     VS = 17
     \]

5. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - From the expression for \( QS \):
     \[
     QS = 2x + 17
     \]
   - We know that \( QS = QU + UT + TS \). Since \( UT = QV = 14 \) inches, we have:
     \[
     QS = 14 + 13 + 17 = 44
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     2x + 17 = 44
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     2x = 44 - 17
     \]
     \[
     2x = 27
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{27}{2} = 13.5
     \]

6. **Revisiting the Problem**:
   - The value \( x = 13.5 \) does not match any of the provided answer choices. However, the closest value among the choices is \( x = 13 \).

### Solution Section:
Based on the calculations, the value of \( x \) is approximately 13.5. Among the given answer choices, the closest value is \( x = 13 \).
