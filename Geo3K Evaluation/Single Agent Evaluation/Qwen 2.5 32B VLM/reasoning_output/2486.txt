### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the measure of the arc \( \widehat{CB} \) in a circle with center \( O \). Here's the information provided:
- Circle \( O \) has a radius of 13 inches.
- Radius \( OB \) is perpendicular to chord \( CD \), and \( CD = 24 \) inches.
- The measure of the arc \( \widehat{CD} \) is given as \( m\widehat{CD} = 134^\circ \).
- We need to find \( m\widehat{CB} \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**
- Since \( OB \perp CD \), \( OB \) bisects \( CD \) into two equal segments. Therefore, the length of each half of \( CD \) is:
  \[
  \frac{CD}{2} = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \text{ inches}
  \]
- This means that the distance from \( O \) to \( CD \) (the perpendicular distance) forms a right triangle with one leg being the radius \( OB = 13 \) inches and the other leg being half the chord \( 12 \) inches.

#### **Step 2: Use the Pythagorean Theorem**
- Let \( X \) be the midpoint of \( CD \). Then \( OX \) is the perpendicular distance from \( O \) to \( CD \). In the right triangle \( OXC \):
  \[
  OC^2 = OX^2 + XC^2
  \]
  where \( OC = 13 \) (radius), \( XC = 12 \), and \( OX \) is the unknown.
  \[
  13^2 = OX^2 + 12^2
  \]
  \[
  169 = OX^2 + 144
  \]
  \[
  OX^2 = 25
  \]
  \[
  OX = 5 \text{ inches}
  \]

#### **Step 3: Determine the Central Angles**
- The measure of the arc \( \widehat{CD} \) is given as \( 134^\circ \). The central angle corresponding to \( \widehat{CD} \) is also \( 134^\circ \) because the measure of an arc is equal to the measure of its central angle.
- Since \( OB \perp CD \), the central angle \( \angle COB \) is split into two equal parts by \( OB \). Therefore, the central angle \( \angle COB \) is:
  \[
  \angle COB = 134^\circ
  \]
- The central angle \( \angle COX \) is half of \( \angle COB \):
  \[
  \angle COX = \frac{134^\circ}{2} = 67^\circ
  \]

#### **Step 4: Find the Measure of Arc \( \widehat{CB} \)**
- The arc \( \widehat{CB} \) corresponds to the central angle \( \angle COB \), which is \( 67^\circ \). Therefore:
  \[
  m\widehat{CB} = 67^\circ
  \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
