### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a geometric figure with several segments labeled with algebraic expressions. The key features are:
1. **Segments**:
   - \( AD = 3x + 11 \)
   - \( DB = 5x - 8 \)
   - \( AB = 2y - 1 \)
   - \( CE = 4y - 7 \)

2. **Triangles**:
   - \( \triangle ADB \) is formed by points \( A \), \( D \), and \( B \).
   - \( \triangle BCE \) is formed by points \( B \), \( C \), and \( E \).

3. **Symbols**:
   - The pink triangles indicate that \( \triangle ADB \sim \triangle BCE \) (similar triangles).
   - The red dots indicate corresponding vertices between the similar triangles.

### Objective:
We need to find the value of \( x \). To do this, we will use the property of similar triangles, which states that the ratios of corresponding sides are equal.

---

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Identify Corresponding Sides**
Since \( \triangle ADB \sim \triangle BCE \), the corresponding sides are:
- \( AD \) corresponds to \( BC \)
- \( DB \) corresponds to \( CE \)
- \( AB \) corresponds to \( BE \)

From the image, we can see:
- \( AD = 3x + 11 \)
- \( DB = 5x - 8 \)
- \( CE = 4y - 7 \)

#### **Step 2: Use the Property of Similar Triangles**
For similar triangles, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal. Therefore:
\[
\frac{AD}{CE} = \frac{DB}{BE}
\]

However, we do not have enough information about \( BE \) directly. Instead, we can use the fact that the ratio of \( AD \) to \( DB \) should be consistent with the ratio of \( CE \) to another segment. Let's focus on the segments we know:
\[
\frac{AD}{DB} = \frac{3x + 11}{5x - 8}
\]

#### **Step 3: Use the Given Information**
The problem does not provide direct information about \( y \) or \( BE \), but it does give us the relationship between \( AD \) and \( DB \). Since \( \triangle ADB \sim \triangle BCE \), the ratio of \( AD \) to \( DB \) must be consistent. We can set up the equation using the given expressions:
\[
\frac{AD}{DB} = \frac{3x + 11}{5x - 8}
\]

#### **Step 4: Solve for \( x \)**
To find \( x \), we need additional information or constraints. However, the problem does not provide explicit values for \( y \) or other segments. Instead, we can assume that the problem is designed such that the given expressions are consistent with the similarity condition. Let's solve the equation:
\[
\frac{3x + 11}{5x - 8} = k
\]
where \( k \) is a constant. Since the problem does not provide \( k \), we need to test the given answer choices to find a consistent value for \( x \).

#### **Step 5: Test the Answer Choices**
We will substitute each value of \( x \) from the answer choices into the expressions for \( AD \) and \( DB \) and check for consistency.

- **Choice A: \( x = 9.5 \)**
  \[
  AD = 3(9.5) + 11 = 28.5 + 11 = 39.5
  \]
  \[
  DB = 5(9.5) - 8 = 47.5 - 8 = 39.5
  \]
  \[
  \frac{AD}{DB} = \frac{39.5}{39.5} = 1
  \]

- **Choice B: \( x = 10.5 \)**
  \[
  AD = 3(10.5) + 11 = 31.5 + 11 = 42.5
  \]
  \[
  DB = 5(10.5) - 8 = 52.5 - 8 = 44.5
  \]
  \[
  \frac{AD}{DB} = \frac{42.5}{44.5} \neq 1
  \]

- **Choice C: \( x = 12.5 \)**
  \[
  AD = 3(12.5) + 11 = 37.5 + 11 = 48.5
  \]
  \[
  DB = 5(12.5) - 8 = 62.5 - 8 = 54.5
  \]
  \[
  \frac{AD}{DB} = \frac{48.5}{54.5} \neq 1
  \]

- **Choice D: \( x = 13.5 \)**
  \[
  AD = 3(13.5) + 11 = 40.5 + 11 = 51.5
  \]
  \[
  DB = 5(13.5) - 8 = 67.5 - 8 = 59.5
  \]
  \[
  \frac{AD}{DB} = \frac{51.5}{59.5} \neq 1
  \]

#### **Step 6: Conclusion**
The only value of \( x \) that satisfies the condition \( \frac{AD}{DB} = 1 \) is \( x = 9.5 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
