### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a circle with several intersecting chords and labeled segments. The goal is to find the value of \( x \), which represents the length of a segment on one of the chords. To solve this, we need to use the **Power of a Point Theorem** (also known as the Intersecting Chords Theorem).

#### Key Observations:
1. **Chord Intersection**: The chords \( AB \) and \( CD \) intersect at point \( E \).
2. **Segment Lengths**:
   - For chord \( AB \): The segments are \( AE = x \) and \( EB = 6 \).
   - For chord \( CD \): The segments are \( CE = 3 \) and \( ED = 4 \).

#### Known Information:
- The Power of a Point Theorem states that for two intersecting chords \( AB \) and \( CD \) at point \( E \):
  \[
  AE \cdot EB = CE \cdot ED
  \]

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Apply the Power of a Point Theorem
According to the theorem:
\[
AE \cdot EB = CE \cdot ED
\]
Substitute the given values:
\[
x \cdot 6 = 3 \cdot 4
\]

#### Step 2: Simplify the Equation
Calculate the right-hand side:
\[
3 \cdot 4 = 12
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
x \cdot 6 = 12
\]

#### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
Divide both sides by 6:
\[
x = \frac{12}{6} = 2
\]

### Verification:
- Check the consistency of the solution by substituting \( x = 2 \) back into the original equation:
  \[
  2 \cdot 6 = 3 \cdot 4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 12 = 12
  \]
  The equation holds true, confirming that \( x = 2 \) is correct.

### Final Answer:
The value of \( x \) is \( 2 \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 2
- B. 3
- C. 4
- D. 6

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]

Final Answer: A
