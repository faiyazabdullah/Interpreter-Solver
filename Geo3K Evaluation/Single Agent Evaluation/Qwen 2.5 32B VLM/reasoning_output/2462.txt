### Problem Analysis:
The given problem involves a circle with a diameter \( AB \). The points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) lie on the circumference of the circle, forming a triangle \( \triangle ABC \). The key information provided is:
- \( AB \) is the diameter of the circle.
- \( AC = 8 \) inches.
- \( BC = 15 \) inches.

We need to find the radius of the circle. Let us proceed step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry
1. **Diameter and Radius Relationship**:
   - Since \( AB \) is the diameter, the radius \( r \) of the circle is half of the diameter: \( r = \frac{AB}{2} \).

2. **Right Triangle Property**:
   - A key property of a circle is that any triangle inscribed in a semicircle (with one side being the diameter) is a right triangle. Here, \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \) because \( AB \) is the diameter.

3. **Pythagorean Theorem**:
   - In the right triangle \( \triangle ABC \), the hypotenuse is \( AB \), and the other two sides are \( AC \) and \( BC \). Using the Pythagorean theorem:
     \[
     AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2
     \]

---

### Step 2: Applying the Pythagorean Theorem
Given:
- \( AC = 8 \) inches
- \( BC = 15 \) inches

Substitute these values into the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
AB^2 = 8^2 + 15^2
\]
\[
AB^2 = 64 + 225
\]
\[
AB^2 = 289
\]
\[
AB = \sqrt{289} = 17 \text{ inches}
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculating the Radius
Since \( AB \) is the diameter, the radius \( r \) is half of the diameter:
\[
r = \frac{AB}{2} = \frac{17}{2} = 8.5 \text{ inches}
\]

---

### Step 4: Verifying the Solution
- The diameter \( AB = 17 \) inches is consistent with the Pythagorean theorem applied to \( \triangle ABC \).
- The radius \( r = 8.5 \) inches is half of the diameter, which is correct.

---

### Final Answer:
The radius of the circle is \( 8.5 \) inches. Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 7.5
- B. 8
- C. 8.5
- D. 17

The correct answer is \( C \).

\[
\boxed{C}
\]
