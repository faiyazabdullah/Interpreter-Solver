### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Image
The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with:
- One leg labeled as \( AC = 5 \) ft.
- Another leg labeled as \( AB = 12 \) ft.
- The hypotenuse \( BC \) is the side we need to find.

The right angle is marked at vertex \( A \), indicating that \( \angle CAB = 90^\circ \).

#### Step 2: Identify the Goal
We are asked to find the length of the hypotenuse \( BC \) using the Pythagorean Theorem. The Pythagorean Theorem states:
\[
c^2 = a^2 + b^2
\]
where \( c \) is the hypotenuse, and \( a \) and \( b \) are the lengths of the other two sides (legs) of the right triangle.

#### Step 3: Assign Variables
From the image:
- \( a = AC = 5 \) ft
- \( b = AB = 12 \) ft
- \( c = BC \) (the hypotenuse, which we need to find)

#### Step 4: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem
Substitute the known values into the Pythagorean Theorem:
\[
c^2 = 5^2 + 12^2
\]

#### Step 5: Perform the Calculations
Calculate the squares of the legs:
\[
5^2 = 25
\]
\[
12^2 = 144
\]

Add these values together:
\[
c^2 = 25 + 144 = 169
\]

Take the square root of both sides to solve for \( c \):
\[
c = \sqrt{169} = 13
\]

#### Step 6: Verify the Result
The calculation is straightforward and aligns with the Pythagorean Theorem. The hypotenuse \( BC \) is indeed 13 ft.

#### Step 7: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated value of the hypotenuse is \( 13 \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 5
- B. \( \sqrt{119} \)
- C. 12
- D. 13

The correct answer is \( D \).

### Solution Section

Using the Pythagorean Theorem:
\[
c^2 = 5^2 + 12^2 = 25 + 144 = 169
\]
\[
c = \sqrt{169} = 13
\]

Thus, the length of the hypotenuse \( BC \) is \( 13 \).

Final Answer: **D**
