### Problem Analysis:
We are given a geometric figure involving multiple circles (G, J, K) that intersect at a common point \( L \). The key information provided is:
- Circles G, J, and K all intersect at point \( L \).
- The length \( GH = 10 \) is given.
- We need to find the length \( FH \).

#### Step 1: Identify Key Elements and Relationships
1. **Circles and Intersections**:
   - Circle G has center \( G \) and passes through points \( H \) and \( F \).
   - Circle J has center \( J \) and passes through point \( L \).
   - Circle K has center \( K \) and passes through point \( L \).
   - All three circles intersect at point \( L \).

2. **Given Information**:
   - \( GH = 10 \): This is the distance from the center \( G \) of circle G to the point \( H \) on its circumference.

3. **Unknown**:
   - We need to find \( FH \), the distance from point \( F \) to point \( H \).

#### Step 2: Analyze the Geometry
- Since \( G \) is the center of circle G, and \( H \) lies on the circumference, \( GH \) is the radius of circle G.
- Point \( F \) also lies on the circumference of circle G. Therefore, \( GF \) is also a radius of circle G.
- By the definition of a circle, all radii are equal. Hence, \( GF = GH = 10 \).

#### Step 3: Use the Property of Circles
- Since \( F \) and \( H \) are both points on the circumference of circle G, the segment \( FH \) is a chord of circle G.
- However, the problem does not provide any specific information about the position of \( F \) relative to \( H \) or any angles. Without loss of generality, we can assume that \( F \) and \( H \) are endpoints of a diameter if no additional constraints are given.

#### Step 4: Consider the Diameter
- If \( F \) and \( H \) lie on a diameter of circle G, then \( FH \) would be twice the radius.
- Since \( GH = 10 \) is the radius, the diameter \( FH \) would be:
  \[
  FH = 2 \times GH = 2 \times 10 = 20
  \]

#### Step 5: Verify the Assumption
- The problem does not specify any other geometric constraints that would alter the relationship between \( F \) and \( H \). Therefore, assuming \( F \) and \( H \) lie on a diameter is a reasonable approach based on the given information.

### Solution
Based on the analysis:
- The radius \( GH = 10 \).
- Assuming \( F \) and \( H \) lie on a diameter, the length \( FH \) is twice the radius:
  \[
  FH = 2 \times 10 = 20
  \]

Thus, the length \( FH \) is \( 20 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
