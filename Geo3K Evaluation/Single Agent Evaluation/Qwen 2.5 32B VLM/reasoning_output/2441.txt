### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves finding the measure of angle 1 (\(\angle 1\)) in a geometric figure. We are given:
- \(m\angle 3 = 110^\circ\)
- \(m\angle 12 = 55^\circ\)

The figure includes multiple lines, angles, and shapes, indicating that we need to use geometric properties such as parallel lines, transversals, and angle relationships (e.g., corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, supplementary angles).

#### Step 1: Identify Key Elements in the Figure
- **Lines and Angles**: The figure contains several intersecting lines and marked angles.
- **Parallel Lines**: The presence of red arrowheads on lines \(AB\) and \(KL\) indicates that these lines are parallel (\(AB \parallel KL\)).
- **Transversals**: Line \(DF\) acts as a transversal for the parallel lines \(AB\) and \(KL\).
- **Given Angles**: \(\angle 3\) and \(\angle 12\) are explicitly given.

#### Step 2: Use Geometric Properties
1. **Parallel Lines and Transversals**:
   - When a transversal intersects two parallel lines, it creates pairs of corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and supplementary angles.
   - Since \(AB \parallel KL\) and \(DF\) is a transversal, we can use these relationships to find unknown angles.

2. **Identify Relationships**:
   - \(\angle 3\) and \(\angle 7\) are corresponding angles because they are on the same side of the transversal \(DF\) and above the parallel lines \(AB\) and \(KL\). Therefore, \(\angle 7 = \angle 3 = 110^\circ\).
   - \(\angle 12\) and \(\angle 15\) are vertical angles, so \(\angle 15 = \angle 12 = 55^\circ\).

3. **Supplementary Angles**:
   - Angles on a straight line sum to \(180^\circ\). For example, \(\angle 7\) and \(\angle 8\) are supplementary because they form a linear pair on line \(DF\). Thus, \(\angle 8 = 180^\circ - \angle 7 = 180^\circ - 110^\circ = 70^\circ\).

4. **Corresponding Angles**:
   - \(\angle 8\) and \(\angle 10\) are corresponding angles because they are on the same side of the transversal \(AL\) and above the parallel lines \(AB\) and \(KL\). Therefore, \(\angle 10 = \angle 8 = 70^\circ\).

5. **Finding \(\angle 1\)**:
   - \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 10\) are adjacent angles on a straight line. Therefore, \(\angle 1 + \angle 10 = 180^\circ\).
   - Substituting \(\angle 10 = 70^\circ\), we get \(\angle 1 = 180^\circ - 70^\circ = 110^\circ\).

### Solution:
By applying the properties of parallel lines and transversals, we have determined that:
- \(\angle 7 = 110^\circ\)
- \(\angle 8 = 70^\circ\)
- \(\angle 10 = 70^\circ\)
- \(\angle 1 = 180^\circ - \angle 10 = 180^\circ - 70^\circ = 110^\circ\)

Thus, the measure of \(\angle 1\) is \(110^\circ\).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
