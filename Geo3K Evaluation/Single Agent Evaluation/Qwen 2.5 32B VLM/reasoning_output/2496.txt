### Problem Analysis:
The image depicts a circle with several chords intersecting inside it. The points of intersection and the lengths of segments are labeled. Specifically:
- Chord \( AC \) intersects chord \( BD \) at point \( E \).
- The segments are divided as follows:
  - \( AE = x \)
  - \( EC = 9 \)
  - \( BE = x \)
  - \( ED = 4 \)

The goal is to find the value of \( x \).

### Thought Section:
#### Step 1: Identify the Relevant Geometric Theorem
The key theorem applicable here is the **Intersecting Chords Theorem**, which states that for two chords \( AB \) and \( CD \) intersecting at a point \( P \) inside a circle, the products of the segments of each chord are equal:
\[
AP \cdot PB = CP \cdot PD
\]
In our case, the chords are \( AC \) and \( BD \), intersecting at point \( E \). Thus, we have:
\[
AE \cdot EC = BE \cdot ED
\]

#### Step 2: Assign Known Values
From the image:
- \( AE = x \)
- \( EC = 9 \)
- \( BE = x \)
- \( ED = 4 \)

#### Step 3: Apply the Intersecting Chords Theorem
Substitute the known values into the equation:
\[
AE \cdot EC = BE \cdot ED
\]
\[
x \cdot 9 = x \cdot 4
\]

#### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
Rearrange the equation:
\[
9x = 4x
\]
Subtract \( 4x \) from both sides:
\[
5x = 36
\]
Divide both sides by 5:
\[
x = \frac{36}{5} = 7.2
\]

#### Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated value of \( x \) is \( 7.2 \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 6
- B. 6.5
- C. 7
- D. 7.5

The closest value to \( 7.2 \) is \( 7.5 \).

### Solution Section:
Based on the calculations and the closest match to the answer choices, the value of \( x \) is \( 7.5 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
