### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the given information
- The figure contains several intersecting lines and angles.
- Key observations:
  - There is a right angle (90°) marked at point \( B \).
  - Another angle is explicitly labeled as 157° at point \( J \).
  - Angle \( \angle 1 \) is formed at the intersection of lines \( HC \) and \( CF \).

#### Step 2: Identify the geometric relationships
- The angle \( \angle 1 \) is part of a larger angular relationship involving the straight line passing through points \( H, C, \) and \( F \).
- The straight line through \( H, C, \) and \( F \) implies that the sum of angles around point \( C \) must equal 180°.

#### Step 3: Use the given angles to find \( \angle 1 \)
- The angle at point \( J \) is 157°. Since \( J \) is on the extension of the line through \( C \), the angle adjacent to 157° on the straight line is:
  \[
  180^\circ - 157^\circ = 23^\circ
  \]
- This 23° angle is part of the larger angle configuration around point \( C \).

#### Step 4: Consider the right angle at \( B \)
- The right angle (90°) at \( B \) does not directly affect the calculation of \( \angle 1 \) but confirms that the figure includes perpendicular lines, which may help in understanding the overall structure.

#### Step 5: Calculate \( \angle 1 \)
- The angle \( \angle 1 \) is the remaining part of the 180° straight line after accounting for the 23° angle and the right angle (90°):
  \[
  \angle 1 = 180^\circ - 23^\circ - 90^\circ = 67^\circ
  \]
- However, upon re-evaluating, it appears there might be a misinterpretation. The angle \( \angle 1 \) is actually the supplement of the 23° angle because it is part of the larger configuration around point \( C \):
  \[
  \angle 1 = 180^\circ - 23^\circ = 157^\circ
  \]

#### Step 6: Reassess and verify
- The angle \( \angle 1 \) is indeed the supplement of the 23° angle, as it forms a linear pair with the 23° angle on the straight line through \( H, C, \) and \( F \).

### Solution Section

Based on the analysis:
- The angle \( \angle 1 \) is the supplement of the 23° angle, which is:
  \[
  \angle 1 = 180^\circ - 23^\circ = 157^\circ
  \]

Thus, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
