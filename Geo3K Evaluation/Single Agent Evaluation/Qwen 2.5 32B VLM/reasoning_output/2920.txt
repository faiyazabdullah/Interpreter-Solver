### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the length of segment \( VS \) in trapezoid \( QRUT \), where \( V \) and \( S \) are the midpoints of the non-parallel sides (legs) \( QU \) and \( RT \), respectively. The given lengths are:
- \( QR = 4 \)
- \( UT = 16 \)

The key geometric principle to apply here is the **Midsegment Theorem for Trapezoids**, which states that the line segment connecting the midpoints of the non-parallel sides (legs) of a trapezoid is parallel to the bases and its length is the average of the lengths of the bases.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Identify the Given Information:
- \( QR \) and \( UT \) are the two parallel bases of the trapezoid.
- \( QR = 4 \)
- \( UT = 16 \)
- \( V \) is the midpoint of \( QU \).
- \( S \) is the midpoint of \( RT \).
- We need to find the length of \( VS \).

#### 2. Apply the Midsegment Theorem for Trapezoids:
The Midsegment Theorem states that the length of the midsegment (the line segment connecting the midpoints of the non-parallel sides) is the average of the lengths of the two bases. Mathematically, this is expressed as:
\[
VS = \frac{QR + UT}{2}
\]

#### 3. Substitute the Given Values:
Substitute \( QR = 4 \) and \( UT = 16 \) into the formula:
\[
VS = \frac{4 + 16}{2}
\]

#### 4. Perform the Calculation:
\[
VS = \frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

#### 5. Verify the Result:
The calculation is straightforward and aligns with the Midsegment Theorem. The length of \( VS \) is indeed the average of the lengths of the bases \( QR \) and \( UT \).

#### 6. Compare with Answer Choices:
The calculated length of \( VS \) is \( 10 \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 5
- B. 9
- C. 10
- D. 12

The correct answer is \( C. 10 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
