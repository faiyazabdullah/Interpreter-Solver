### Problem Analysis:
The image depicts a circle with several key elements:
- Points \( E \), \( F \), \( G \), and \( D \) are involved.
- Segments \( EF \) and \( FG \) are tangent to the circle at points \( F \) and \( G \), respectively.
- The length of segment \( EF \) is given as 12.
- The length of segment \( ED \) (from point \( E \) to point \( D \)) is given as 16.
- We need to find the length of segment \( FG \), denoted as \( x \).

### Thought Section:
1. **Identify Key Geometric Relationships**:
   - Since \( EF \) and \( FG \) are tangents drawn from the same external point \( E \) to the circle, they are equal in length. This is a fundamental property of tangents from a common external point to a circle.

2. **Apply Tangent-Segment Theorem**:
   - The Tangent-Segment Theorem states that if two tangent segments are drawn from the same external point to a circle, their lengths are equal.
   - Therefore, \( EF = FG \).

3. **Substitute Given Values**:
   - From the problem, \( EF = 12 \).
   - By the Tangent-Segment Theorem, \( FG = EF \).
   - Thus, \( FG = 12 \).

4. **Verify Consistency**:
   - The length \( ED = 16 \) does not directly affect the calculation of \( FG \) because it is not related to the tangents \( EF \) and \( FG \). It is likely included for context or to test understanding of irrelevant information.

5. **Compare with Answer Choices**:
   - The calculated value of \( x \) is 12.
   - The answer choices are:
     - A. \( \frac{3}{14} \)
     - B. \( \frac{14}{3} \)
     - C. 12
     - D. 16
   - The correct choice is \( C \).

### Solution Section:
Based on the Tangent-Segment Theorem, we have:
\[ EF = FG \]
Given \( EF = 12 \), it follows that:
\[ FG = 12 \]

Thus, the value of \( x \) is \( 12 \).
