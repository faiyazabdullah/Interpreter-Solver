### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a circle with points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \). The arc \( AC \) is labeled as \( 122^\circ \). We need to find the measure of \( \angle B \), which is an inscribed angle subtending the same arc \( AC \).

#### Key Observations:
1. **Arc \( AC \)**: The measure of the arc \( AC \) is given as \( 122^\circ \).
2. **Inscribed Angle Theorem**: An inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends. Mathematically, if \( \theta \) is the measure of the arc, then the measure of the inscribed angle is \( \frac{\theta}{2} \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the relationship between the arc and the inscribed angle.
The inscribed angle \( \angle B \) subtends the arc \( AC \). According to the Inscribed Angle Theorem:
\[
\text{Measure of } \angle B = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Measure of arc } AC
\]

#### Step 2: Substitute the given measure of the arc.
The measure of arc \( AC \) is \( 122^\circ \). Therefore:
\[
\text{Measure of } \angle B = \frac{1}{2} \times 122^\circ
\]

#### Step 3: Perform the calculation.
\[
\text{Measure of } \angle B = \frac{122}{2} = 61^\circ
\]

### Final Answer:
The measure of \( \angle B \) is \( 61^\circ \). Comparing this with the given answer choices, we find that the correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{C}
\]

### Final Answer: C
