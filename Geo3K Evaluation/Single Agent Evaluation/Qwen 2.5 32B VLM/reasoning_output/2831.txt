### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Image
The image shows a circle with several tangent segments and labeled lengths. Here's what we can observe:
- There is a circle with center \( O \) (not explicitly marked but implied).
- Tangent segments are drawn from points outside the circle to points on the circle.
- The tangent segments are labeled with their respective lengths:
  - Segment \( BE = 15 \)
  - Segment \( CE = 12 \)
  - Segment \( DF = 8 \)
  - Segment \( AF = x \)

#### Step 2: Understand the Problem
We need to find the value of \( x \), which represents the length of segment \( AF \). The key geometric principle here is the **Tangent-Segment Theorem**, which states that tangent segments drawn from the same external point to a circle are equal in length.

#### Step 3: Apply the Tangent-Segment Theorem
- From point \( B \), the tangent segments are \( BE \) and \( BD \). Therefore, \( BD = BE = 15 \).
- From point \( C \), the tangent segments are \( CE \) and \( CD \). Therefore, \( CD = CE = 12 \).
- From point \( D \), the tangent segments are \( DF \) and \( DA \). Therefore, \( DA = DF = 8 \).

#### Step 4: Express \( x \) in Terms of Known Quantities
- Let \( AF = x \).
- Since \( DA = 8 \) and \( DA = DF + FA \), we have:
  \[
  DA = DF + FA \implies 8 = 8 + x
  \]
  This equation is consistent, but it does not directly help us find \( x \).

#### Step 5: Use the Tangent-Segment Theorem for Point \( A \)
- From point \( A \), the tangent segments are \( AF \) and \( AE \). Therefore, \( AE = AF = x \).

#### Step 6: Use the Tangent-Segment Theorem for Point \( D \)
- From point \( D \), the tangent segments are \( DF \) and \( DA \). Therefore, \( DA = DF + AF \):
  \[
  DA = DF + AF \implies 8 = 8 + x
  \]
  This confirms that \( AF = x \).

#### Step 7: Verify the Consistency of the Tangent-Segment Theorem
- From point \( B \): \( BE = BD = 15 \)
- From point \( C \): \( CE = CD = 12 \)
- From point \( D \): \( DF = DA = 8 \)
- From point \( A \): \( AE = AF = x \)

#### Step 8: Solve for \( x \)
Since the problem does not provide additional constraints or relationships, we rely on the given answer choices. The value of \( x \) must be consistent with the tangent-segment theorem. Given the symmetry and the fact that \( AF = x \) is a tangent segment, we can infer that \( x \) should be a value that fits the context of the problem.

#### Step 9: Compare with Answer Choices
The answer choices are:
A. 7.2
B. 8
C. 12
D. 15

Given that \( AF = x \) and the tangent-segment theorem implies \( AF = DF = 8 \), the most reasonable choice is \( x = 8 \).

### Solution Section

Based on the analysis and application of the Tangent-Segment Theorem, the value of \( x \) is:

\[
\boxed{B}
\]
