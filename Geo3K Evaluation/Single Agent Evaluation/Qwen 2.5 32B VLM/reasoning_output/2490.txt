====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with determining the value of \( x \) such that the quadrilateral \( ABCD \) becomes a parallelogram. To solve this, we need to use the properties of parallelograms, specifically:
1. Opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal.
2. Opposite angles of a parallelogram are equal.

From the image:
- The lengths of two sides are given as \( x + 4 \) and \( 3x - 6 \).
- The angles at vertices \( C \) and \( D \) are \( 60^\circ \) and \( 55^\circ \), respectively.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Use the property of opposite sides being equal**
For \( ABCD \) to be a parallelogram, the opposite sides must be equal. Therefore:
\[ AB = CD \]
\[ BC = DA \]

From the image:
- \( AB = 3x - 6 \)
- \( CD = x + 4 \)

Setting these equal gives:
\[ 3x - 6 = x + 4 \]

#### **Step 2: Solve for \( x \)**
\[ 3x - 6 = x + 4 \]
Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
\[ 2x - 6 = 4 \]
Add 6 to both sides:
\[ 2x = 10 \]
Divide by 2:
\[ x = 5 \]

#### **Step 3: Verify the solution**
If \( x = 5 \):
- \( AB = 3x - 6 = 3(5) - 6 = 15 - 6 = 9 \)
- \( CD = x + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9 \)

Since \( AB = CD \), the condition for opposite sides being equal is satisfied.

#### **Step 4: Check the angles**
The angles at vertices \( C \) and \( D \) are given as \( 60^\circ \) and \( 55^\circ \), respectively. For a parallelogram, opposite angles must be equal. However, the problem does not provide enough information about the other angles, so we cannot directly verify this condition without additional data. Nonetheless, the side condition is sufficient to determine \( x \).

### Final Answer:
The value of \( x \) that makes the quadrilateral a parallelogram is \( 5 \).

\[
\boxed{B}
\]
