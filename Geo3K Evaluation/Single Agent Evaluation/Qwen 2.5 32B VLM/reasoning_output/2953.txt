### Problem Analysis:
The given image shows a triangle with several labeled angles and points. The goal is to find the measure of **∠3**. Let's break down the information provided:

1. **Given Angles:**
   - ∠C = 70° (at vertex C)
   - ∠A = 40° (at vertex A)
   - ∠2 = 45° (an interior angle at vertex B)

2. **Unknowns:**
   - We need to find the measure of **∠3**.

3. **Geometric Relationships:**
   - The sum of the interior angles in a triangle is always 180°.
   - The angles around a point sum up to 360°.

### Thought Section:
#### Step 1: Identify the Triangle's Interior Angles
The triangle has vertices \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \). The interior angles are:
- ∠C = 70°
- ∠A = 40°
- ∠B (the angle at vertex B) can be calculated using the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180°.

\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = 180°
\]
\[
\text{∠B} = 180° - ∠C - ∠A = 180° - 70° - 40° = 70°
\]

So, the interior angle at vertex \( B \) is 70°.

#### Step 2: Analyze the Angle at Vertex B
The angle at vertex \( B \) is split into two parts:
- One part is labeled as ∠2 = 45°.
- The other part is the remaining portion of the 70° angle at vertex \( B \).

Thus, the remaining angle at vertex \( B \) is:
\[
70° - 45° = 25°
\]

#### Step 3: Determine ∠3
∠3 is an exterior angle formed by extending the side of the triangle at vertex \( B \). According to the Exterior Angle Theorem, the measure of an exterior angle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.

The two non-adjacent interior angles to ∠3 are:
- ∠C = 70°
- ∠A = 40°

Therefore:
\[
\text{∠3} = ∠C + ∠A = 70° + 40° = 110°
\]

However, we notice that ∠3 is not directly the exterior angle but part of the straight line formed by extending the side of the triangle. Since ∠3 is adjacent to the 25° angle (calculated earlier), we use the fact that angles on a straight line sum to 180°:
\[
\text{∠3} = 180° - 25° = 155°
\]

Revisiting the problem, it seems there might be a misinterpretation. Let’s recheck the context of ∠3. If ∠3 is part of the triangle's internal configuration, it should be related to the 70° and 40° angles directly. Thus, the correct interpretation is:
\[
\text{∠3} = 70° + 40° = 110° - 25° = 95°
\]

#### Final Verification:
The correct measure of ∠3, considering the internal configuration and the given angles, is:
\[
\text{∠3} = 95°
\]

### Solution Section:
Based on the detailed analysis and calculations, the measure of ∠3 is **95°**.

Final Answer: **C**
