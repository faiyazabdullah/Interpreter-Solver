### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Image and Given Information
The image shows a quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with the following observations:
- The shape appears to be a rhombus, as indicated by the equal side lengths and symmetry.
- The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at point \(E\), which is the midpoint of both diagonals (a property of rhombuses).
- The problem provides two expressions for the side lengths:
  - \(AB = 2x + 3\)
  - \(BC = 5x\)

#### Step 2: Understand the Geometric Properties of a Rhombus
A rhombus has the following key properties:
1. All four sides are equal in length.
2. Opposite sides are parallel.
3. Diagonals bisect each other at right angles.
4. The diagonals divide the rhombus into four congruent right triangles.

Given these properties, we know:
\[ AB = BC = CD = DA \]

#### Step 3: Set Up the Equation Based on Side Lengths
Since all sides of the rhombus are equal, we can equate the expressions for \(AB\) and \(BC\):
\[ AB = BC \]
\[ 2x + 3 = 5x \]

#### Step 4: Solve for \(x\)
Rearrange the equation to isolate \(x\):
\[ 2x + 3 = 5x \]
\[ 3 = 5x - 2x \]
\[ 3 = 3x \]
\[ x = 1 \]

#### Step 5: Calculate the Side Length of the Rhombus
Substitute \(x = 1\) back into the expression for \(AB\):
\[ AB = 2x + 3 = 2(1) + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5 \]

Since all sides of the rhombus are equal, \(AD = AB = 5\).

#### Step 6: Verify the Consistency
- The value \(x = 1\) satisfies the equation \(2x + 3 = 5x\).
- The side length \(AD = 5\) is consistent with the properties of a rhombus.

#### Step 7: Match the Solution to the Answer Choices
The calculated side length \(AD = 5\) matches one of the given answer choices.

### Solution Section

Based on the step-by-step analysis and calculations:
1. Equated the side lengths \(AB\) and \(BC\) to find \(x\).
2. Substituted \(x = 1\) into the expression for \(AB\) to determine the side length.
3. Confirmed that all sides of the rhombus are equal, including \(AD\).

The final answer is:
\[ AD = 5 \]

Final Answer: D
