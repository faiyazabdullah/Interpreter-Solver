### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a regular hexagon (a six-sided polygon) with a side length of \(6 \, \text{cm}\). The goal is to find the area of this regular hexagon. Here's how we will approach the problem step by step:

#### Step 1: Identify the given information
- The figure is a **regular hexagon**.
- Each side of the hexagon has a length of \(6 \, \text{cm}\).

#### Step 2: Recall the formula for the area of a regular hexagon
The area \(A\) of a regular hexagon with side length \(s\) is given by:
\[
A = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2
\]
where \(s\) is the side length of the hexagon.

#### Step 3: Substitute the given side length into the formula
Here, \(s = 6 \, \text{cm}\). Plugging this into the formula:
\[
A = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 6^2
\]

#### Step 4: Simplify the expression
First, calculate \(6^2\):
\[
6^2 = 36
\]
Now substitute this back into the formula:
\[
A = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 36
\]
Simplify the multiplication:
\[
A = \frac{3 \times 36 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{108\sqrt{3}}{2} = 54\sqrt{3}
\]

#### Step 5: Approximate the value of \(\sqrt{3}\)
The value of \(\sqrt{3}\) is approximately \(1.732\). Substitute this approximation:
\[
A \approx 54 \times 1.732 = 93.528
\]

#### Step 6: Round to the nearest tenth
Rounding \(93.528\) to the nearest tenth gives:
\[
A \approx 93.5
\]

#### Step 7: Compare with the given answer choices
The calculated area is \(93.5 \, \text{cm}^2\), which is closest to the answer choice **C. 101.8**.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
