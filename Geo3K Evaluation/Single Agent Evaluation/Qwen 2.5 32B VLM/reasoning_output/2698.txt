### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a geometric figure with a circle, where points \( T \), \( W \), and \( Y \) are connected to the center \( X \). The lengths of the segments \( TX \) and \( WX \) are given as \( 4x \) and \( 2x + 10 \), respectively. The problem states that \( WT \cong TY \), which implies that the triangles \( WTY \) and \( TWY \) are congruent.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Congruence**: Since \( WT \cong TY \), triangle \( WTY \) is isosceles with \( WT = TY \).
2. **Radii of the Circle**: Both \( TX \) and \( WX \) are radii of the circle, so they are equal in length.
   - Therefore, \( TX = WX \).

#### Given Information:
- \( TX = 4x \)
- \( WX = 2x + 10 \)

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Use the property of equal radii.
Since \( TX \) and \( WX \) are both radii of the same circle, we have:
\[
TX = WX
\]
Substitute the given expressions for \( TX \) and \( WX \):
\[
4x = 2x + 10
\]

#### Step 2: Solve the equation for \( x \).
Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:
\[
4x - 2x = 10
\]
\[
2x = 10
\]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[
x = 5
\]

#### Step 3: Verify the solution.
If \( x = 5 \):
- \( TX = 4x = 4(5) = 20 \)
- \( WX = 2x + 10 = 2(5) + 10 = 10 + 10 = 20 \)
Both radii are equal, confirming that the solution is consistent with the properties of the circle.

#### Step 4: Check the congruence condition.
The problem states \( WT \cong TY \), which is consistent with the isosceles nature of triangle \( WTY \). The value of \( x \) does not affect this condition directly, but it ensures the radii are equal, which is a necessary condition for the congruence of the triangles.

### Final Answer:
The value of \( x \) is \( 5 \).

\[
\boxed{C}
\]
