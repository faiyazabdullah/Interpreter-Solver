====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with points \( M \) and \( N \) on sides \( AB \) and \( AC \), respectively. It is given that \( MN \parallel BC \). This implies that \( \triangle AMN \) is similar to \( \triangle ABC \) by the **Basic Proportionality Theorem** (also known as Thales' theorem).

#### Key Information:
1. \( MN \parallel BC \)
2. Lengths of segments:
   - \( AB = 24 \)
   - \( AC = 20 \)
   - \( AM = 4x - 6 \)
   - \( AN = 3x - 2 \)

#### Goal:
We need to solve for \( x \) using the similarity of triangles \( \triangle AMN \) and \( \triangle ABC \).

---

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Understanding Similarity
Since \( MN \parallel BC \), the triangles \( \triangle AMN \) and \( \triangle ABC \) are similar by the Basic Proportionality Theorem. This means the ratios of corresponding sides are equal:
\[
\frac{AM}{AB} = \frac{AN}{AC}
\]

#### Step 2: Substitute Known Values
From the problem, we know:
- \( AB = 24 \)
- \( AC = 20 \)
- \( AM = 4x - 6 \)
- \( AN = 3x - 2 \)

Substitute these into the proportion:
\[
\frac{AM}{AB} = \frac{AN}{AC} \implies \frac{4x - 6}{24} = \frac{3x - 2}{20}
\]

#### Step 3: Solve the Proportion
Cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:
\[
(4x - 6) \cdot 20 = (3x - 2) \cdot 24
\]

Expand both sides:
\[
80x - 120 = 72x - 48
\]

Rearrange the equation to isolate \( x \):
\[
80x - 72x = 120 - 48
\]
\[
8x = 72
\]
\[
x = 9
\]

#### Step 4: Verify the Solution
Substitute \( x = 9 \) back into the expressions for \( AM \) and \( AN \):
\[
AM = 4x - 6 = 4(9) - 6 = 36 - 6 = 30
\]
\[
AN = 3x - 2 = 3(9) - 2 = 27 - 2 = 25
\]

Check the proportion:
\[
\frac{AM}{AB} = \frac{30}{24} = \frac{5}{4}, \quad \frac{AN}{AC} = \frac{25}{20} = \frac{5}{4}
\]
The proportion holds true, confirming that \( x = 9 \) is correct.

#### Step 5: Match with Answer Choices
The calculated value of \( x \) is \( 9 \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 6
- B. 9
- C. 12
- D. 15

The correct choice is \( B \).

---

### Solution Section:

The value of \( x \) is \( 9 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
