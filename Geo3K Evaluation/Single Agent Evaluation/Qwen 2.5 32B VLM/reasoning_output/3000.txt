### Problem Analysis:
We are given a rhombus \(ABCD\) with the following information:
- \(P\) is a point inside the rhombus.
- \(PB = 12\).
- \(AB = 15\).
- \(\angle ABD = 24^\circ\).

We need to find \(\angle BDA\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Properties of a Rhombus**
A rhombus has the following key properties:
1. All sides are equal: \(AB = BC = CD = DA = 15\).
2. Opposite angles are equal.
3. Diagonals bisect each other at right angles.
4. Each diagonal bisects the angles of the rhombus.

#### **Step 2: Understanding the Given Information**
- \(PB = 12\): This is a segment from point \(P\) to vertex \(B\). However, since \(P\) is not specified further (e.g., as the intersection of diagonals), we focus on the rhombus properties and the given angle.
- \(\angle ABD = 24^\circ\): This is one of the angles formed by the diagonal \(BD\) and side \(AB\).

#### **Step 3: Using the Rhombus Diagonal Property**
In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles (\(90^\circ\)). Additionally, each diagonal bisects the angles of the rhombus. Therefore:
- \(\angle ABD = 24^\circ\) implies that \(\angle DBC = 24^\circ\) (since \(BD\) bisects \(\angle ABC\)).
- Similarly, \(\angle ADB = \angle BDC\) because \(BD\) bisects \(\angle ADC\).

#### **Step 4: Sum of Angles in Triangle \(ABD\)** 
Consider \(\triangle ABD\):
- \(AB = AD = 15\) (sides of the rhombus).
- \(\angle ABD = 24^\circ\).
- Since \(AB = AD\), \(\triangle ABD\) is isosceles with \(AB = AD\).

In an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal. Therefore:
\[ \angle ADB = \angle ABD = 24^\circ. \]

#### **Step 5: Verify the Calculation**
To confirm, we use the fact that the sum of angles in any triangle is \(180^\circ\):
\[ \angle ABD + \angle ADB + \angle BAD = 180^\circ. \]
Substitute the known values:
\[ 24^\circ + 24^\circ + \angle BAD = 180^\circ. \]
\[ 48^\circ + \angle BAD = 180^\circ. \]
\[ \angle BAD = 132^\circ. \]

This confirms that \(\angle ADB = 24^\circ\) is consistent with the properties of the rhombus and the given information.

### Final Answer:
The measure of \(\angle BDA\) is \(24^\circ\).

\[
\boxed{A}
\]
