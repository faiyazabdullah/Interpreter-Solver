### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the measure of angle \( \angle 3 \) in the given geometric figure. Here's the breakdown of the information provided:

1. **Quadrilateral \( ABCD \)**: It is explicitly stated that \( ABCD \) is a rectangle. This implies:
   - All interior angles of the rectangle are right angles (\( 90^\circ \)).
   - Opposite sides are equal and parallel.
   - Diagonals \( AC \) and \( BD \) are congruent and bisect each other.

2. **Given Information**:
   - \( m\angle 2 = 40^\circ \).
   - Angles and segments are labeled in the figure, but their specific measurements (e.g., lengths) are not directly relevant to solving for \( \angle 3 \).

3. **Objective**: Determine \( m\angle 3 \).

### Thought Section:
#### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry of the Rectangle
- Since \( ABCD \) is a rectangle, we know:
  - \( \angle A \), \( \angle B \), \( \angle C \), and \( \angle D \) are all \( 90^\circ \).
  - The diagonals \( AC \) and \( BD \) intersect at point \( E \), which is the midpoint of both diagonals. This means \( E \) divides each diagonal into two equal parts.

#### Step 2: Analyzing \( \angle 2 \)
- \( \angle 2 \) is given as \( 40^\circ \). From the figure, \( \angle 2 \) is an angle formed by the diagonal \( AC \) and one side of the rectangle (specifically, \( AB \)).
- Since \( AB \) is perpendicular to \( AD \) (as \( ABCD \) is a rectangle), the angle between \( AB \) and \( AC \) is part of a right triangle involving \( \angle 2 \).

#### Step 3: Relating \( \angle 2 \) to \( \angle 3 \)
- \( \angle 3 \) is the angle formed by the diagonal \( BD \) and the side \( CD \) of the rectangle.
- Because \( ABCD \) is a rectangle, the diagonals \( AC \) and \( BD \) are congruent and bisect each other. This symmetry implies that the angles formed by the diagonals with the sides of the rectangle are related.

#### Step 4: Using Symmetry and Right Angles
- The key property here is that the diagonals of a rectangle divide it into four right triangles, and the angles formed by the diagonals with the sides are complementary to the angles formed by the diagonals with the adjacent sides.
- Specifically, since \( \angle 2 \) is \( 40^\circ \), the angle between \( AC \) and \( AB \) is \( 40^\circ \). By symmetry, the angle between \( BD \) and \( CD \) (which is \( \angle 3 \)) must also be \( 40^\circ \).

#### Step 5: Verifying the Calculation
- The angle \( \angle 3 \) is directly opposite to \( \angle 2 \) in the context of the rectangle's symmetry. Therefore, \( m\angle 3 = 40^\circ \).

---

### Solution Section:
Based on the analysis:
- The measure of \( \angle 2 \) is \( 40^\circ \).
- Due to the symmetry and properties of the rectangle, \( \angle 3 \) must also be \( 40^\circ \).

Thus, the measure of \( \angle 3 \) is \( 40^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
