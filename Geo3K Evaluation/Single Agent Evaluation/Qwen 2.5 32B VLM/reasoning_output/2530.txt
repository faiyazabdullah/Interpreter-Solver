### Problem Analysis:
The given image shows a quadrilateral \( JKLM \) with the following details:
- \( JM = 6 \)
- \( KL = 6 \)
- \( \angle M = 80^\circ \)
- The sides \( JM \) and \( KL \) are marked as equal, suggesting symmetry or specific properties.
- We are asked to find the measure of \( \angle K \).

#### Key Observations:
1. The quadrilateral \( JKLM \) appears to be symmetrical due to the equal side lengths \( JM = KL = 6 \).
2. The angle \( \angle M = 80^\circ \) is given, which provides a starting point for analysis.
3. The problem does not specify whether the quadrilateral is a parallelogram, rectangle, or another type of quadrilateral, but the symmetry suggests it might be a kite or an isosceles trapezoid.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### Step 1: Analyze the Symmetry
The equal side lengths \( JM = KL = 6 \) suggest that the quadrilateral might have some form of symmetry. However, without additional information about parallel sides or specific angle measures, we cannot definitively classify the shape.

#### Step 2: Use Geometric Properties
To find \( \angle K \), we need more information about the relationships between the angles. Since the problem does not provide explicit details about the other angles, we must rely on the symmetry and the sum of interior angles in a quadrilateral.

The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is:
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = 360^\circ
\]

Let the angles be:
- \( \angle J = x \)
- \( \angle K = y \)
- \( \angle L = z \)
- \( \angle M = 80^\circ \)

Thus:
\[
x + y + z + 80^\circ = 360^\circ
\]
\[
x + y + z = 280^\circ
\]

#### Step 3: Consider Possible Shapes
Given the symmetry and equal side lengths, let us consider the possibility that \( JKLM \) is an isosceles trapezoid or a kite. In both cases, the non-parallel sides (legs) are equal, and the base angles are equal.

- **Isosceles Trapezoid**: If \( JKLM \) is an isosceles trapezoid, then \( \angle J = \angle L \) and \( \angle K = \angle M \). However, the problem does not indicate parallel sides, so this is not certain.
- **Kite**: If \( JKLM \) is a kite, then \( \angle J = \angle L \) and the diagonals intersect at right angles. Again, we lack explicit information to confirm this.

#### Step 4: Use the Given Angle
Since \( \angle M = 80^\circ \) and the quadrilateral is symmetric, it is reasonable to assume that \( \angle K \) is related to \( \angle M \) through symmetry. However, without more specific information, we cannot determine \( \angle K \) precisely.

#### Step 5: Revisit the Question and Answer Choices
The answer choices are:
- A. 6
- B. 60
- C. 100
- D. 180

Given the symmetry and the fact that \( \angle M = 80^\circ \), it is plausible that \( \angle K \) is also related to \( 80^\circ \). However, none of the answer choices directly correspond to \( 80^\circ \). The closest logical choice, considering the symmetry and the sum of angles, is \( 100^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
