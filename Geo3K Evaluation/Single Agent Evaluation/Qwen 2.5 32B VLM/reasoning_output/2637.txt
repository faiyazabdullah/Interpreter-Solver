### Problem Analysis:
The image depicts a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with the following details:
- \( AB \) is the vertical side (unknown length \( x \)).
- \( AC \) is the horizontal side with length 12.
- \( BC \) is the hypotenuse with length 25.5.
- The angle at \( A \) is a right angle (\( \angle CAB = 90^\circ \)).

We are tasked with finding the value of \( x \) (the length of \( AB \)) to the nearest tenth.

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Identify the geometric relationship
The triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle, so we can use the **Pythagorean theorem**:
\[
AB^2 + AC^2 = BC^2
\]
Here:
- \( AB = x \) (the unknown we need to find).
- \( AC = 12 \).
- \( BC = 25.5 \).

#### Step 2: Substitute the known values into the Pythagorean theorem
Substitute \( AC = 12 \) and \( BC = 25.5 \) into the equation:
\[
x^2 + 12^2 = 25.5^2
\]

#### Step 3: Simplify the equation
First, calculate \( 12^2 \) and \( 25.5^2 \):
\[
12^2 = 144
\]
\[
25.5^2 = 25.5 \times 25.5 = 650.25
\]
Now substitute these values into the equation:
\[
x^2 + 144 = 650.25
\]

#### Step 4: Solve for \( x^2 \)
Isolate \( x^2 \) by subtracting 144 from both sides:
\[
x^2 = 650.25 - 144
\]
\[
x^2 = 506.25
\]

#### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)
Take the square root of both sides to solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \sqrt{506.25}
\]
Using a calculator:
\[
x \approx 22.5
\]

#### Step 6: Round to the nearest tenth
The value of \( x \) is already to the nearest tenth, which is 22.5.

#### Step 7: Verify the result
To ensure accuracy, we can check if the values satisfy the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
x^2 + 12^2 = 22.5^2 + 144 = 506.25 + 144 = 650.25
\]
This matches the hypotenuse squared (\( 25.5^2 = 650.25 \)), confirming our solution is correct.

### Solution Section:

The value of \( x \) is approximately 22.5. Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 22.5
- B. 23
- C. 23.5
- D. 24

The closest answer choice is **A. 22.5**.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
