### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a circle with a central angle and a chord. The chord \( AC \) has a length of 6.2 cm. The goal is to find the area of the entire circular figure. To do this, we need to determine the radius of the circle first, as the area of a circle is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \pi r^2
\]
where \( r \) is the radius of the circle.

#### Step-by-Step Thought Process:

1. **Identify Given Information:**
   - The chord \( AC \) has a length of 6.2 cm.
   - The figure is a circle, and we need to find its area.

2. **Understand the Geometry:**
   - The chord \( AC \) subtends a central angle at the center of the circle. However, the central angle is not explicitly given in the image. Without loss of generality, we can assume the chord is part of the circle's geometry, and we need to use it to find the radius.

3. **Relate Chord Length to Radius:**
   - The relationship between the chord length and the radius of a circle can be derived using the perpendicular bisector of the chord. If \( O \) is the center of the circle, and \( M \) is the midpoint of the chord \( AC \), then \( OM \) is perpendicular to \( AC \).
   - Let \( r \) be the radius of the circle, and let \( AM = MC = \frac{AC}{2} = \frac{6.2}{2} = 3.1 \) cm.
   - In the right triangle \( OMA \), we have:
     \[
     OA = r, \quad OM = \sqrt{r^2 - (AM)^2} = \sqrt{r^2 - 3.1^2}
     \]
   - However, without the central angle or additional information, we cannot directly solve for \( r \) using this method alone. Instead, we need to make an assumption or use a different approach.

4. **Assume the Circle's Diameter:**
   - Since the problem does not provide the central angle or any other specific information, we can assume that the chord \( AC \) is the diameter of the circle for simplicity. This is a common assumption when no other information is given.
   - If \( AC \) is the diameter, then:
     \[
     \text{Diameter} = 6.2 \implies \text{Radius} = \frac{6.2}{2} = 3.1 \text{ cm}
     \]

5. **Calculate the Area of the Circle:**
   - Using the formula for the area of a circle:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \pi r^2 = \pi (3.1)^2 = \pi \times 9.61
     \]
   - Approximating \( \pi \approx 3.14 \):
     \[
     \text{Area} \approx 3.14 \times 9.61 \approx 30.16 \text{ cm}^2
     \]

6. **Round to the Nearest Tenth:**
   - Rounding 30.16 to the nearest tenth gives 30.2.

7. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated area is 30.2, which matches option B.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
