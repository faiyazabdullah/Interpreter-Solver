### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Image and Identify Given Information
The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle PQR \) with the following details:
- \( PR = 8 \) (one leg of the triangle)
- \( QR = 15 \) (the hypotenuse of the triangle)
- \( PQ = 17 \) (another segment extending vertically from \( Q \) to a point \( P \))

From the image, it is clear that \( \angle R \) is a right angle because there is a square symbol at \( R \). This means \( \triangle PQR \) is a right triangle with \( QR \) as the hypotenuse.

#### Step 2: Understand What Needs to Be Found
We need to find the value of \( \cos P \) and express it as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth. The cosine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as:
\[
\cos P = \frac{\text{adjacent side}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
Here, the adjacent side to \( \angle P \) is \( PR \), and the hypotenuse is \( QR \).

#### Step 3: Verify the Hypotenuse
The hypotenuse of a right triangle is the longest side. From the given information:
- \( QR = 15 \)
- \( PR = 8 \)
- \( PQ = 17 \)

Since \( PQ = 17 \) is longer than \( QR = 15 \), \( PQ \) cannot be the hypotenuse of \( \triangle PQR \). Therefore, the hypotenuse is indeed \( QR = 15 \).

#### Step 4: Calculate \( \cos P \)
Using the definition of cosine:
\[
\cos P = \frac{\text{adjacent side}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{PR}{QR} = \frac{8}{15}
\]

#### Step 5: Convert to Decimal and Round
Calculate the decimal value of \( \frac{8}{15} \):
\[
\frac{8}{15} \approx 0.5333
\]
Rounding to the nearest hundredth:
\[
0.5333 \approx 0.53
\]

#### Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated value of \( \cos P \) is approximately \( 0.53 \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 0.47
- B. 0.53
- C. 0.88
- D. 1.88

The closest value is \( 0.53 \).

### Solution Section

Based on the step-by-step analysis and calculations:
\[
\cos P = \frac{8}{15} \approx 0.53
\]

Final Answer: **B**
