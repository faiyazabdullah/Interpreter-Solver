### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the given information
- The image shows a rhombus with diagonals labeled as \( AC \) and \( BX \).
- One diagonal is twice as long as the other.
- The area of the rhombus is given as 169 square millimeters.
- We need to find the lengths of the diagonals.

#### Step 2: Recall the formula for the area of a rhombus
The area \( A \) of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2
\]
where \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \) are the lengths of the diagonals.

#### Step 3: Define the diagonals
Let the length of the shorter diagonal be \( d \). Then, the length of the longer diagonal is \( 2d \).

#### Step 4: Substitute the known values into the area formula
Given that the area \( A = 169 \) square millimeters, we substitute \( d_1 = d \) and \( d_2 = 2d \) into the area formula:
\[
169 = \frac{1}{2} \times d \times 2d
\]

#### Step 5: Simplify the equation
Simplify the right-hand side of the equation:
\[
169 = \frac{1}{2} \times 2d^2
\]
\[
169 = d^2
\]

#### Step 6: Solve for \( d \)
Take the square root of both sides:
\[
d = \sqrt{169}
\]
\[
d = 13
\]

#### Step 7: Determine the lengths of the diagonals
- The shorter diagonal \( d_1 = d = 13 \) millimeters.
- The longer diagonal \( d_2 = 2d = 2 \times 13 = 26 \) millimeters.

#### Step 8: Verify the solution
Substitute \( d_1 = 13 \) and \( d_2 = 26 \) back into the area formula to ensure consistency:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times 13 \times 26 = \frac{1}{2} \times 338 = 169
\]
The calculation is correct.

#### Step 9: Match the solution to the answer choices
The lengths of the diagonals are 13 mm and 26 mm. The answer choices provided are:
A. 6.5
B. 13
C. 26
D. 52

The correct choice is \( 26 \), which corresponds to answer choice C.

### Solution Section

The lengths of the diagonals are 13 mm and 26 mm. The correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{C}
\]
