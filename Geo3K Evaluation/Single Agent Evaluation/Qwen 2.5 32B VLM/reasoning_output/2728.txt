### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a circle with a regular polygon inscribed in it. The shaded region is the part of the circle that lies outside the polygon. To find the area of the shaded region, we need to:
1. Calculate the area of the circle.
2. Calculate the area of the inscribed regular polygon.
3. Subtract the area of the polygon from the area of the circle.

#### Given Information:
- The radius of the circle is \( r = 10 \) cm.
- The polygon appears to be a regular hexagon (since it has 6 vertices).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Calculate the Area of the Circle
The formula for the area of a circle is:
\[
\text{Area of circle} = \pi r^2
\]
Substituting \( r = 10 \):
\[
\text{Area of circle} = \pi (10)^2 = 100\pi
\]
Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
\[
\text{Area of circle} \approx 100 \times 3.14159 = 314.159 \text{ cm}^2
\]

#### Step 2: Calculate the Area of the Regular Hexagon
A regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles. The side length of each equilateral triangle is equal to the radius of the circle, which is 10 cm.

The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle with side length \( s \) is:
\[
\text{Area of equilateral triangle} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2
\]
For \( s = 10 \):
\[
\text{Area of one equilateral triangle} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} (10)^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 100 = 25\sqrt{3}
\]
Since the hexagon is composed of 6 such triangles:
\[
\text{Area of hexagon} = 6 \times 25\sqrt{3} = 150\sqrt{3}
\]
Using \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \):
\[
\text{Area of hexagon} \approx 150 \times 1.732 = 259.8 \text{ cm}^2
\]

#### Step 3: Calculate the Area of the Shaded Region
The shaded region is the area of the circle minus the area of the hexagon:
\[
\text{Area of shaded region} = \text{Area of circle} - \text{Area of hexagon}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Area of shaded region} \approx 314.159 - 259.8 = 54.359 \text{ cm}^2
\]

### Reassessment and Verification:
Upon re-examining the problem, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding. The shaded region in the image appears to be the segments of the circle outside the hexagon, not the entire remaining area. The segments are the portions of the circle between the sides of the hexagon and the circumference.

#### Correct Approach for Segments:
Each segment of the circle corresponds to a central angle of \( 60^\circ \) (since the hexagon divides the circle into 6 equal parts). The area of one segment can be calculated as:
\[
\text{Area of one segment} = \text{Area of sector} - \text{Area of triangle}
\]
- **Area of one sector**:
\[
\text{Area of sector} = \frac{60^\circ}{360^\circ} \times \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{6} \times 100\pi = \frac{100\pi}{6} = \frac{50\pi}{3}
\]
- **Area of one triangle** (already calculated as part of the hexagon):
\[
\text{Area of one triangle} = 25\sqrt{3}
\]
Thus, the area of one segment is:
\[
\text{Area of one segment} = \frac{50\pi}{3} - 25\sqrt{3}
\]
For 6 segments:
\[
\text{Total area of segments} = 6 \left( \frac{50\pi}{3} - 25\sqrt{3} \right) = 100\pi - 150\sqrt{3}
\]
Substituting \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \) and \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \):
\[
100\pi \approx 100 \times 3.14159 = 314.159
\]
\[
150\sqrt{3} \approx 150 \times 1.732 = 259.8
\]
\[
\text{Total area of segments} \approx 314.159 - 259.8 = 54.359 \text{ cm}^2
\]

### Final Calculation:
The correct interpretation should consider the total area of the segments, which is consistent with the initial calculation. However, upon re-evaluating the problem, it seems the question might have intended the total area outside the hexagon, which includes the segments.

### Final Answer:
Given the options, the closest value to the calculated area of the segments is not directly listed. However, considering the total shaded area (including the segments), the correct choice aligns with the area of the circle minus the hexagon.

\[
\boxed{C}
\]
