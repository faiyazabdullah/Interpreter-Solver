### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
- The image shows a circle with center \( M \).
- \( FL = 24 \) is a chord of the circle.
- \( HJ = 48 \) is another chord of the circle.
- \( m\widehat{HP} = 65^\circ \), which means the measure of the arc \( HP \) is \( 65^\circ \).
- We need to find \( m\widehat{PJ} \).

#### Step 2: Understand the Geometry of the Problem
- The circle is symmetric, and the chords \( FL \) and \( HJ \) intersect at point \( M \), the center of the circle.
- Since \( M \) is the center, \( FL \) and \( HJ \) are diameters of the circle because they pass through the center.
- The arc \( \widehat{HP} \) is given as \( 65^\circ \). We need to determine the measure of the arc \( \widehat{PJ} \).

#### Step 3: Use Properties of Circles
- The total measure of a circle is \( 360^\circ \).
- Since \( HJ \) is a diameter, it divides the circle into two semicircles, each measuring \( 180^\circ \).
- The arc \( \widehat{HP} \) is part of the semicircle containing \( H \) and \( P \). Therefore, the remaining arc in this semicircle is \( \widehat{PJ} \).

#### Step 4: Calculate the Measure of \( \widehat{PJ} \)
- The semicircle containing \( H \) and \( P \) has a total measure of \( 180^\circ \).
- The measure of \( \widehat{HP} \) is given as \( 65^\circ \).
- Therefore, the measure of \( \widehat{PJ} \) is the remainder of the semicircle after subtracting \( \widehat{HP} \):
  \[
  m\widehat{PJ} = 180^\circ - 65^\circ = 115^\circ
  \]

#### Step 5: Reassess and Verify
- The calculation is straightforward and uses basic properties of circles.
- The measure of \( \widehat{PJ} \) is indeed \( 115^\circ \), but we need to check the answer choices to see if there is a mistake or if the problem involves additional constraints.

#### Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices
- The answer choices are:
  - A. 37.5
  - B. 65
  - C. 85
  - D. 130
- None of these choices match \( 115^\circ \). However, upon re-examining the problem, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or a different interpretation required.

#### Step 7: Reinterpret the Problem
- Upon closer inspection, the problem might involve the relationship between the arcs and the given chords. However, the direct calculation using the semicircle property seems correct.
- The closest choice to \( 115^\circ \) is \( 130^\circ \), which might be an approximation or a different interpretation.

### Solution Section

Based on the analysis and calculations:

1. The measure of \( \widehat{HP} \) is \( 65^\circ \).
2. The semicircle containing \( H \) and \( P \) has a total measure of \( 180^\circ \).
3. Therefore, the measure of \( \widehat{PJ} \) is:
   \[
   m\widehat{PJ} = 180^\circ - 65^\circ = 115^\circ
   \]
4. Since \( 115^\circ \) is not among the answer choices, the closest choice is \( 130^\circ \).
