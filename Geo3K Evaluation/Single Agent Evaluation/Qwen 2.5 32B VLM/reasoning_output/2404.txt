### Problem Analysis:
The given image shows a circle with several points and lines, including:
- Points \( A, B, C, D, M, N, T \) on or around the circle.
- \( M \) is the center of the circle.
- \( \angle MTN = 28^\circ \).
- Lines \( AB, AC, AD \), and others are drawn, with some perpendicular markings indicating right angles (e.g., \( \perp \) at \( M \)).

We need to find the measure of \( \angle CAM \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Identify Key Geometric Relationships**
1. **Circle Center and Perpendiculars**: Since \( M \) is the center of the circle, any line segment from \( M \) to a point on the circle is a radius. For example, \( MA \), \( MB \), \( MC \), etc., are radii.
2. **Right Angles**: The perpendicular markings indicate that certain lines are perpendicular to radii. Specifically:
   - \( MB \perp AN \) implies \( \angle MBN = 90^\circ \).
   - \( MD \perp AC \) implies \( \angle MAD = 90^\circ \).

#### **Step 2: Analyze \( \angle MTN \)**
- \( \angle MTN = 28^\circ \) is given. This angle is subtended by the arc \( TN \) at the center \( M \). Therefore, the arc \( TN \) has a measure of \( 28^\circ \).

#### **Step 3: Use Inscribed Angle Theorem**
- The inscribed angle theorem states that an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle subtending the same arc. However, we need to focus on the specific angle \( \angle CAM \).

#### **Step 4: Focus on \( \angle CAM \)**
- \( \angle CAM \) is part of the larger triangle \( \triangle CAM \). Since \( M \) is the center, \( MA \) and \( MC \) are radii, making \( \triangle CAM \) isosceles with \( MA = MC \).
- The key is to relate \( \angle CAM \) to the given \( \angle MTN \).

#### **Step 5: Use Symmetry and Perpendicularity**
- The perpendicularity at \( M \) indicates that \( MD \perp AC \). This means \( D \) is the midpoint of the chord \( AC \), and \( \angle MAD = 90^\circ \).
- Since \( \angle MTN = 28^\circ \), the arc \( TN \) is \( 28^\circ \). The inscribed angle subtending this arc (e.g., \( \angle TAN \)) would be half of this, i.e., \( 14^\circ \).

#### **Step 6: Relate \( \angle CAM \) to the Given Information**
- The angle \( \angle CAM \) is part of the isosceles triangle \( \triangle CAM \). Since \( MD \perp AC \), \( \angle CAM \) is half of the angle subtended by the arc \( AC \) at the center.
- However, the direct relationship here is simpler: \( \angle CAM \) is directly related to the given \( \angle MTN \) because \( \angle CAM \) is effectively half of the central angle subtending the same arc (due to symmetry and the properties of the circle).

#### **Step 7: Calculate \( \angle CAM \)**
- Given \( \angle MTN = 28^\circ \), the angle \( \angle CAM \) is half of this value because it is an inscribed angle subtending the same arc.
- Therefore, \( \angle CAM = \frac{28^\circ}{2} = 14^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{A}
