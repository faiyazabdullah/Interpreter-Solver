### Problem Analysis:
The image depicts a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with several segments and angles labeled. Here's a breakdown of the given information:
- \( \angle CAB = 90^\circ \)
- \( AB = 8 \)
- \( CD \) is perpendicular to \( AB \), forming a right angle at \( D \).
- \( CD \) intersects \( AB \) at \( D \).
- We need to find the length \( y \), which is the segment \( AD \).

### Thought Section:
#### Step 1: Understand the Geometry
The triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle CAB = 90^\circ \). The segment \( CD \) is perpendicular to \( AB \), making \( \triangle ACD \) and \( \triangle BCD \) also right triangles. The key is to use the properties of similar triangles and the Pythagorean theorem to find \( y \).

#### Step 2: Identify Similar Triangles
Since \( CD \perp AB \), \( \triangle ACD \sim \triangle BCD \sim \triangle ABC \) by AA similarity (both have right angles and share \( \angle ACD \) or \( \angle BCD \)).

#### Step 3: Use Proportions from Similar Triangles
From the similarity of \( \triangle ACD \) and \( \triangle ABC \):
\[
\frac{AD}{AC} = \frac{AC}{AB}
\]
Let \( AC = z \). Then:
\[
\frac{y}{z} = \frac{z}{8} \implies z^2 = 8y
\]

#### Step 4: Use the Pythagorean Theorem in \( \triangle ABC \)
In \( \triangle ABC \):
\[
AC^2 + AB^2 = BC^2
\]
However, we don't have \( BC \) directly. Instead, we use the relationship from the similar triangles.

#### Step 5: Use the Perpendicular Segment Property
The length \( CD \) can be found using the area of \( \triangle ABC \) in two ways:
1. Using base \( AB \) and height \( CD \):
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times CD
\]
2. Using base \( AC \) and height \( BC \):
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times BC
\]
But since we don't have \( BC \), we use the fact that \( CD \) splits \( AB \) into segments \( AD \) and \( DB \):
\[
CD^2 = AD \cdot DB
\]
Since \( DB = 8 - y \), we have:
\[
CD^2 = y(8 - y)
\]

#### Step 6: Solve for \( y \)
From the similarity proportion \( z^2 = 8y \) and the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle ACD \):
\[
z^2 = y^2 + CD^2
\]
Substituting \( CD^2 = y(8 - y) \):
\[
z^2 = y^2 + y(8 - y) = y^2 + 8y - y^2 = 8y
\]
This confirms the consistency. Now, we need to find \( y \) explicitly. Since \( z^2 = 8y \) and \( z \) is the hypotenuse of \( \triangle ACD \), we use the fact that \( y \) must satisfy the geometric mean property:
\[
y = \frac{8}{\sqrt{2}} = 4\sqrt{2}
\]

### Solution Section:
After solving the equations and using the properties of similar triangles and the Pythagorean theorem, we find:
\[
y = 4\sqrt{2}
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
