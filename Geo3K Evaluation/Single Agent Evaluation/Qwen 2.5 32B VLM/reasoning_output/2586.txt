### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a triangle \( \triangle MPL \) with the following key features:
1. Angles at vertices \( M \) and \( P \) are both \( 60^\circ \).
2. Side lengths are given as:
   - \( MP = 4 \)
   - \( ML = 2y + 6 \)
   - \( PL = 5x - 3 \)

The task is to find the value of \( x \).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### **Step 1: Identify the type of triangle**
- The triangle has two angles of \( 60^\circ \). Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \), the third angle at vertex \( L \) must also be \( 60^\circ \).
- Therefore, \( \triangle MPL \) is an **equilateral triangle**. In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal.

#### **Step 2: Use the property of equilateral triangles**
- All sides of an equilateral triangle are equal. Thus:
  \[
  MP = ML = PL
  \]
- From the given side lengths:
  \[
  MP = 4
  \]
  \[
  ML = 2y + 6
  \]
  \[
  PL = 5x - 3
  \]

#### **Step 3: Set up equations for the side lengths**
- Since \( MP = ML \):
  \[
  4 = 2y + 6
  \]
- Solve for \( y \):
  \[
  4 = 2y + 6 \implies 2y = 4 - 6 \implies 2y = -2 \implies y = -1
  \]

- Since \( MP = PL \):
  \[
  4 = 5x - 3
  \]
- Solve for \( x \):
  \[
  4 = 5x - 3 \implies 5x = 4 + 3 \implies 5x = 7 \implies x = \frac{7}{5} = 1.4
  \]

#### **Step 4: Verify the solution**
- We have determined \( x = 1.4 \). Let's verify by checking all side lengths:
  - \( MP = 4 \)
  - \( ML = 2y + 6 = 2(-1) + 6 = -2 + 6 = 4 \)
  - \( PL = 5x - 3 = 5(1.4) - 3 = 7 - 3 = 4 \)
- All sides are equal, confirming that \( \triangle MPL \) is indeed equilateral.

### Final Answer:
The value of \( x \) is \( 1.4 \).

\[
\boxed{C}
\]
