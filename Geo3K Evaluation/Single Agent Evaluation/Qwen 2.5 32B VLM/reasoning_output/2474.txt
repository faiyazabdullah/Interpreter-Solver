### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Figure
The image shows a quadrilateral labeled as \( MNPQ \). The figure is identified as a parallelogram, which has the following key properties:
- Opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.
- Opposite angles are equal.
- Consecutive angles are supplementary (sum to \( 180^\circ \)).

#### Step 2: Identify Given Information
From the problem statement:
- \( m\angle M = 10x \)
- \( m\angle N = 20x \)

We need to find the measure of \( \angle M \).

#### Step 3: Use Properties of Parallelograms
In a parallelogram:
1. Opposite angles are equal.
   - Therefore, \( \angle M = \angle Q \) and \( \angle N = \angle P \).
2. Consecutive angles are supplementary.
   - Therefore, \( \angle M + \angle N = 180^\circ \).

#### Step 4: Set Up Equations
Using the property of consecutive angles being supplementary:
\[ m\angle M + m\angle N = 180^\circ \]

Substitute the given expressions for \( m\angle M \) and \( m\angle N \):
\[ 10x + 20x = 180^\circ \]

#### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)
Combine like terms:
\[ 30x = 180^\circ \]

Divide both sides by 30:
\[ x = 6 \]

#### Step 6: Find \( m\angle M \)
Now that we have \( x = 6 \), substitute \( x \) back into the expression for \( m\angle M \):
\[ m\angle M = 10x = 10(6) = 60^\circ \]

#### Step 7: Verify the Solution
- Check if \( m\angle N = 20x \):
  \[ m\angle N = 20(6) = 120^\circ \]
- Verify the supplementary condition:
  \[ m\angle M + m\angle N = 60^\circ + 120^\circ = 180^\circ \]
  This confirms the solution is correct.

#### Step 8: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated value of \( m\angle M \) is \( 60^\circ \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 30
- B. 45
- C. 60
- D. 120

The correct choice is \( C \).

### Solution Section

The measure of \( \angle M \) is \( 60^\circ \).
