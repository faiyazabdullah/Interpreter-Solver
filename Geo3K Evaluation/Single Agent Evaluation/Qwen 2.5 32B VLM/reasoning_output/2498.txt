### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \). Inside the triangle, there is a point \( D \) on the side \( BC \). The given angles are:
- \( \angle BAC = 52^\circ \)
- \( \angle ABC = 27^\circ \)

We need to find the measure of \( \angle 1 \), which is the angle at point \( D \) formed by the line segment \( AD \) and the side \( BC \).

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Understand the problem
We are tasked with finding \( m\angle 1 \). The angle \( \angle 1 \) is part of the triangle \( \triangle ABD \) and is adjacent to \( \angle ABC \). Since \( D \) lies on \( BC \), we can use the fact that the sum of the interior angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \).

#### Step 2: Identify key geometric relationships
- The angle \( \angle BAC \) is given as \( 52^\circ \).
- The angle \( \angle ABC \) is given as \( 27^\circ \).
- The angle \( \angle 1 \) is part of the triangle \( \triangle ABD \), and it is the exterior angle to \( \triangle ABD \) when considering \( \angle BAD \) and \( \angle ABD \).

#### Step 3: Use the Exterior Angle Theorem
The Exterior Angle Theorem states that the measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles. In this case:
- \( \angle 1 \) is the exterior angle at vertex \( D \) for \( \triangle ABD \).
- The two non-adjacent interior angles are \( \angle BAC \) and \( \angle ABC \).

Thus:
\[
m\angle 1 = m\angle BAC + m\angle ABC
\]

#### Step 4: Substitute the given values
From the problem, we know:
\[
m\angle BAC = 52^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad m\angle ABC = 27^\circ
\]
Substitute these values into the equation:
\[
m\angle 1 = 52^\circ + 27^\circ
\]

#### Step 5: Perform the calculation
\[
m\angle 1 = 79^\circ
\]

#### Step 6: Verify the result
The calculation is straightforward and uses the basic properties of triangles and the Exterior Angle Theorem. There are no additional constraints or hidden information that would affect this result.

### Solution Section:

Based on the calculations and the application of the Exterior Angle Theorem, the measure of \( \angle 1 \) is:
\[
m\angle 1 = 79^\circ
\]

Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 21
- B. 27
- C. 52
- D. 79

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
