### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Analyze the Image and Identify Key Information
The image shows a circle with several tangent segments. Here are the key observations:
- **Tangent Segments**: The segments labeled \(8.1\), \(10.3\), and \(17\) appear to be tangent to the circle at points \(D\), \(E\), and \(C\) respectively.
- **Given Measurements**:
  - Tangent segment \(JD = 8.1\)
  - Tangent segment \(XE = 10.3\)
  - Tangent segment \(BC = 17\)
- **Unknown**: The length of the tangent segment \(XB\) (denoted as \(x\)).

#### Step 2: Understand the Geometric Relationships
The problem states that segments that appear to be tangent are indeed tangent. A key property of tangents drawn from an external point to a circle is that they are equal in length. This means:
- If \(J\) and \(D\) are points of tangency from an external point, then \(JD\) and \(XD\) (if they exist) would be equal.
- Similarly, \(XE\) and \(BE\) would be equal, and \(XC\) and \(BC\) would be equal.

However, in this image, we only have one tangent segment per external point, so we need to focus on the relationship between the given tangent segments and the unknown \(x\).

#### Step 3: Apply Relevant Geometric Properties
From the image, we can see that the tangent segments \(XD\) and \(XB\) share the same external point \(X\). According to the tangent-tangent theorem:
- The lengths of the tangent segments drawn from an external point to a circle are equal.

Thus:
- \(XD = XE = 10.3\)
- \(XB = BC = 17\)

However, the problem asks us to find \(x\), which represents the length of \(XB\). From the image, it is clear that \(XB\) is directly given as \(17\).

#### Step 4: Verify and Reassess
The image shows that \(XB\) is explicitly labeled as \(17\). There is no ambiguity in this measurement, and it directly corresponds to the value of \(x\).

#### Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices
The value of \(x\) is \(17\). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 5
- B. 8.1
- C. 10.3
- D. 21.6

The closest value to \(17\) is not listed among the options. However, since the problem explicitly states to choose the closest option, we must select the closest available choice.

### Solution Section:

Based on the analysis, the value of \(x\) is \(17\). The closest option to \(17\) from the given choices is \(21.6\).

Final Answer: D
