### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
- The image shows a circle with several points labeled: \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), \( D \), \( E \), and \( G \).
- There is a marked angle \( \angle CAB = 60^\circ \).
- Point \( G \) is the intersection of the perpendicular bisector of chord \( AB \) with the circle.
- Line segments \( CG \) and \( GE \) are drawn, and we need to find \( m\angle BGE \).

#### Step 2: Understand Geometric Relationships
1. **Perpendicular Bisector Property**: The perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the center of the circle. Therefore, point \( G \) lies on the perpendicular bisector of \( AB \) and is equidistant from \( A \) and \( B \). This implies that \( G \) is the midpoint of the arc \( AB \) that does not contain \( C \).
2. **Central Angle and Inscribed Angle**: The angle \( \angle CAB = 60^\circ \) is an inscribed angle. The central angle subtended by the same arc \( AB \) is twice the inscribed angle. Therefore, the central angle \( \angle COB = 2 \times 60^\circ = 120^\circ \).
3. **Arcs and Angles**: Since \( G \) is the midpoint of the arc \( AB \) not containing \( C \), the arc \( AG \) and arc \( GB \) are each half of the arc \( AB \). Thus, each of these arcs measures \( \frac{120^\circ}{2} = 60^\circ \).

#### Step 3: Use Circle Geometry Properties
- **Inscribed Angle Theorem**: An inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts. Therefore, \( \angle BGE \) is an inscribed angle that intercepts the arc \( BE \).
- **Arc \( BE \)**: Since \( G \) is the midpoint of the arc \( AB \), the arc \( BE \) is the remaining part of the circle after removing the arc \( AB \). The total circle is \( 360^\circ \), so the arc \( BE \) measures \( 360^\circ - 120^\circ = 240^\circ \).
- **Measure of \( \angle BGE \)**: The inscribed angle \( \angle BGE \) is half the measure of the arc \( BE \). Therefore, \( m\angle BGE = \frac{1}{2} \times 240^\circ = 120^\circ \).

#### Step 4: Verify the Calculation
- The calculation is consistent with the properties of inscribed angles and arcs in a circle.
- The arc \( BE \) is correctly identified as \( 240^\circ \), and the inscribed angle \( \angle BGE \) is half of this arc, which is \( 120^\circ \).

#### Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated value of \( m\angle BGE \) is \( 120^\circ \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 60
- B. 120
- C. 240
- D. 360

The correct answer is \( 120^\circ \).

### Solution Section

Based on the analysis and calculations:
1. The arc \( BE \) measures \( 240^\circ \).
2. The inscribed angle \( \angle BGE \) is half of the arc \( BE \), so \( m\angle BGE = 120^\circ \).

Final Answer: **B**
