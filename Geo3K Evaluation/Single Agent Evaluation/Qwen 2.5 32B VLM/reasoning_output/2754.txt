### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a quadrilateral with labeled angles at vertices \( B \), \( D \), \( C \), and \( E \). The angles at these vertices are given as follows:
- \( \angle B = 5y^\circ \)
- \( \angle D = 2x^\circ \)
- \( \angle C = 120^\circ \)
- \( \angle E = 108^\circ \)

We need to find the value of \( x \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Recall the property of the sum of interior angles in a quadrilateral**
The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is always \( 360^\circ \). This can be expressed as:
\[
\angle B + \angle D + \angle C + \angle E = 360^\circ
\]

#### **Step 2: Substitute the given angle measures into the equation**
From the image, we have:
\[
\angle B = 5y^\circ, \quad \angle D = 2x^\circ, \quad \angle C = 120^\circ, \quad \angle E = 108^\circ
\]
Substituting these into the equation:
\[
5y + 2x + 120 + 108 = 360
\]

#### **Step 3: Simplify the equation**
Combine the constant terms:
\[
5y + 2x + 228 = 360
\]
Subtract 228 from both sides:
\[
5y + 2x = 132
\]

#### **Step 4: Solve for \( x \) in terms of \( y \)**
Rearrange the equation to isolate \( 2x \):
\[
2x = 132 - 5y
\]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[
x = \frac{132 - 5y}{2}
\]

#### **Step 5: Use additional geometric properties to find \( y \)**
The problem does not provide a direct relationship between \( x \) and \( y \) other than the equation derived. However, since the question asks for the value of \( x \), we need to assume that the problem is solvable with the given information. Let's re-evaluate the equation:
\[
5y + 2x = 132
\]

#### **Step 6: Check for possible values of \( y \)**
Since \( y \) and \( x \) are variables representing angles, they must be positive integers. We need to test integer values for \( y \) to find a valid \( x \).

- If \( y = 12 \):
  \[
  5(12) + 2x = 132 \implies 60 + 2x = 132 \implies 2x = 72 \implies x = 36
  \]

#### **Step 7: Verify the solution**
If \( y = 12 \) and \( x = 36 \), substitute back into the original equation:
\[
5(12) + 2(36) + 120 + 108 = 60 + 72 + 120 + 108 = 360
\]
The equation holds true.

### Final Answer:
The value of \( x \) is \( 36 \).

\[
\boxed{A}
\]
