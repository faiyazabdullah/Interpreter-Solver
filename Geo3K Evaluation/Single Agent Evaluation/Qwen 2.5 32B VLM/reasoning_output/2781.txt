### Problem Analysis:
We are given a rhombus \(ABCD\) with the following information:
- \(ABCD\) is a rhombus.
- \(\angle ABC = 70^\circ\).
- We need to find the measure of \(\angle 1\), which is the angle formed by the diagonals of the rhombus at their intersection point \(E\).

#### Key Properties of a Rhombus:
1. All sides are equal in length.
2. Opposite angles are equal.
3. Diagonals bisect each other at right angles (90Â°).
4. Diagonals bisect the angles of the rhombus.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Understand the Given Information
- Since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, its diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at point \(E\) and bisect each other at right angles.
- The diagonals also bisect the angles of the rhombus. Therefore, \(\angle ABC\) is bisected by diagonal \(BD\).

#### Step 2: Calculate the Measure of \(\angle ABE\) and \(\angle EBC\)
- Given \(\angle ABC = 70^\circ\).
- Since the diagonals bisect the angles of the rhombus, \(\angle ABE = \angle EBC = \frac{1}{2} \times \angle ABC\).
- \(\angle ABE = \angle EBC = \frac{1}{2} \times 70^\circ = 35^\circ\).

#### Step 3: Use the Property of Diagonals Bisecting at Right Angles
- The diagonals of a rhombus intersect at right angles, meaning \(\angle AEB = 90^\circ\).
- In \(\triangle ABE\), we know:
  - \(\angle ABE = 35^\circ\)
  - \(\angle AEB = 90^\circ\)
  - The sum of the angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\).

#### Step 4: Calculate \(\angle 1\)
- Let \(\angle 1\) be the angle formed by the diagonals at point \(E\). Since the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, \(\angle 1\) is the angle opposite to \(\angle AEB\) in \(\triangle ABE\).
- In \(\triangle ABE\):
  \[
  \angle 1 = 180^\circ - \angle ABE - \angle AEB
  \]
  \[
  \angle 1 = 180^\circ - 35^\circ - 90^\circ = 55^\circ
  \]

### Final Answer:
The measure of \(\angle 1\) is \(55^\circ\).

\[
\boxed{B}
\]
