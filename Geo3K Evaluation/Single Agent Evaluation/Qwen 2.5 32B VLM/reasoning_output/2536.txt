### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the length of \( ZX \) given the following information:
1. The diameters of circles \(\odot A\), \(\odot B\), and \(\odot C\) are 10, 30, and 10 units, respectively.
2. \( AZ \cong CW \) and \( CW = 2 \).
3. The figure shows a configuration where the circles are aligned along a straight line, and points \( E, X, Y, D \) lie on this line.

#### Step 1: Understand the given information
- The diameter of \(\odot A\) is 10, so its radius \( r_A = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \).
- The diameter of \(\odot B\) is 30, so its radius \( r_B = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).
- The diameter of \(\odot C\) is 10, so its radius \( r_C = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \).
- \( AZ \cong CW \) implies \( AZ = CW \). Given \( CW = 2 \), we have \( AZ = 2 \).

#### Step 2: Determine the positions of key points
- Since \( AZ = 2 \), point \( Z \) is 2 units to the right of point \( A \).
- Since \( CW = 2 \), point \( W \) is 2 units to the left of point \( C \).

#### Step 3: Calculate the total length of the line segment \( ED \)
- The centers of the circles are aligned along the line \( ED \).
- The distance between the centers of \(\odot A\) and \(\odot B\) is the sum of their radii: \( r_A + r_B = 5 + 15 = 20 \).
- The distance between the centers of \(\odot B\) and \(\odot C\) is the sum of their radii: \( r_B + r_C = 15 + 5 = 20 \).
- Therefore, the total distance from \( E \) to \( D \) is the sum of the radii of \(\odot A\), \(\odot B\), and \(\odot C\), plus the distances \( AZ \) and \( CW \):
  \[
  ED = r_A + r_B + r_C + AZ + CW = 5 + 15 + 5 + 2 + 2 = 39.
  \]

#### Step 4: Determine the position of point \( X \)
- Point \( X \) is the point where the circle \(\odot A\) touches the circle \(\odot B\). Since the circles are tangent, the distance from \( A \) to \( X \) is equal to the radius of \(\odot A\), which is 5.
- Therefore, \( AX = 5 \).

#### Step 5: Calculate \( ZX \)
- Point \( Z \) is 2 units to the right of \( A \). Therefore, the distance from \( Z \) to \( X \) is:
  \[
  ZX = AX - AZ = 5 - 2 = 3.
  \]

### Solution:
The length of \( ZX \) is \( 3 \).

Final Answer: \boxed{A}
