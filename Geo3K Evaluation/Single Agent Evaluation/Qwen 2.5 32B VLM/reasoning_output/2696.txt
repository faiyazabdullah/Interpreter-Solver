### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Image and Given Information
- The image depicts a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
- The triangle is labeled as **isosceles**, which means at least two sides are equal in length.
- The sides are labeled with algebraic expressions:
  - \( AC = 4x + 1 \)
  - \( BC = 5x - 0.5 \)
  - \( AB = 9x - 1 \)

#### Step 2: Identify Key Properties of Isosceles Triangles
- In an isosceles triangle, two sides are equal. Based on the markings in the image:
  - The tick marks on \( AC \) and \( BC \) indicate that \( AC = BC \).

#### Step 3: Set Up the Equation for Equal Sides
- Since \( AC = BC \):
  \[
  4x + 1 = 5x - 0.5
  \]

#### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
- Rearrange the equation to isolate \( x \):
  \[
  4x + 1 = 5x - 0.5
  \]
  Subtract \( 4x \) from both sides:
  \[
  1 = x - 0.5
  \]
  Add \( 0.5 \) to both sides:
  \[
  x = 1.5
  \]

#### Step 5: Calculate the Length of \( AC \)
- Substitute \( x = 1.5 \) into the expression for \( AC \):
  \[
  AC = 4x + 1
  \]
  \[
  AC = 4(1.5) + 1
  \]
  \[
  AC = 6 + 1
  \]
  \[
  AC = 7
  \]

#### Step 6: Verify Consistency
- Check if \( BC \) is also equal to \( AC \):
  \[
  BC = 5x - 0.5
  \]
  \[
  BC = 5(1.5) - 0.5
  \]
  \[
  BC = 7.5 - 0.5
  \]
  \[
  BC = 7
  \]
- Both \( AC \) and \( BC \) are equal to 7, confirming the isosceles property.

#### Step 7: Compare with Answer Choices
- The calculated length of \( AC \) is 7.
- The answer choices are:
  - A. 1.5
  - B. 7
  - C. 11
  - D. 12.5

### Solution Section

The length of \( AC \) is \( 7 \). This matches answer choice B.
