### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the value of \( x \) given specific segment lengths in a geometric figure. The key information provided is:
- \( AE = 3 \)
- \( AB = 2 \)
- \( BC = 6 \)
- \( ED = 2x - 3 \)

The goal is to determine the value of \( x \) based on these relationships. Let us proceed step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Geometric Relationships
From the image, we observe the following:
1. Points \( A, B, C, D, E \) form a connected path.
2. Segments \( AE \), \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( ED \) are explicitly mentioned.
3. The relationship between these segments needs to be analyzed to find \( x \).

#### Key Observations:
- \( AE = 3 \) is the total length from \( A \) to \( E \).
- \( AB = 2 \) is part of \( AE \), so \( BE = AE - AB = 3 - 2 = 1 \).
- \( BC = 6 \) is a separate segment extending from \( B \) to \( C \).
- \( ED = 2x - 3 \) is the length of the segment from \( E \) to \( D \).

Since \( E \) lies on the path from \( A \) to \( D \), the total length from \( A \) to \( D \) can be expressed as:
\[ AD = AE + ED \]

---

### Step 2: Express \( AD \) in Terms of Known Quantities
We know:
- \( AE = 3 \)
- \( ED = 2x - 3 \)

Thus, the total length \( AD \) is:
\[ AD = AE + ED = 3 + (2x - 3) = 2x \]

---

### Step 3: Use Additional Information
From the image, we see that \( B \) is a point on the path from \( A \) to \( D \). Therefore, the total length \( AD \) can also be expressed as the sum of segments along the path:
\[ AD = AB + BC + CD \]

However, we do not have the direct length of \( CD \). Instead, we focus on the fact that \( AD \) is entirely determined by the segments \( AE \) and \( ED \):
\[ AD = 2x \]

---

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
We need to ensure consistency in the geometric relationships. Since \( AD = 2x \) and no additional constraints contradict this, we solve for \( x \) using the given expression for \( ED \):
\[ ED = 2x - 3 \]

Given that \( ED \) is a valid segment length, it must be positive:
\[ 2x - 3 > 0 \]
\[ 2x > 3 \]
\[ x > 1.5 \]

Now, we compare the possible values of \( x \) with the answer choices.

---

### Step 5: Check Answer Choices
The answer choices are:
A. 5
B. 6
C. 8
D. 9

Substitute each value of \( x \) into \( ED = 2x - 3 \) to ensure it is consistent:
- For \( x = 5 \):
  \[ ED = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \]
  This is valid.

- For \( x = 6 \):
  \[ ED = 2(6) - 3 = 12 - 3 = 9 \]
  This is valid.

- For \( x = 8 \):
  \[ ED = 2(8) - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]
  This is valid.

- For \( x = 9 \):
  \[ ED = 2(9) - 3 = 18 - 3 = 15 \]
  This is valid.

Since all values are mathematically valid, we must rely on the problem's context or additional clues. However, without further constraints, the smallest value that fits all conditions is \( x = 5 \).

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
