### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a circle with several points labeled (A, B, C, D, E, F) and some geometric elements:
1. **Line segments**: AD, AC, AB, AF, BE, etc.
2. **Angles**: An angle at point A is marked as \(67^\circ\) (angle CAD).
3. **Right angle**: There is a right angle at point A (indicated by the square symbol between lines AE and AD).
4. **Unknown angle**: The angle \(x\) is formed at point A by the line segments AB and AF.

We need to determine the value of \(x\).

---

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Identify Key Geometric Relationships
- **Right Angle at A**: Since there is a right angle at point A, \(\angle DAE = 90^\circ\).
- **Given Angle**: \(\angle CAD = 67^\circ\).
- **Unknown Angle**: We need to find \(\angle BAF = x\).

#### Step 2: Use the Right Angle Property
Since \(\angle DAE = 90^\circ\), the angles around point A must sum up to \(90^\circ\) because they form part of the right angle.

#### Step 3: Break Down the Angles
The angle \(\angle DAE\) can be split into two parts:
1. \(\angle CAD = 67^\circ\)
2. The remaining angle between lines AD and AF, which we will call \(\angle FAD\).

Thus, the relationship is:
\[
\angle FAD + \angle CAD = 90^\circ
\]
Substituting the given value:
\[
\angle FAD + 67^\circ = 90^\circ
\]
Solving for \(\angle FAD\):
\[
\angle FAD = 90^\circ - 67^\circ = 23^\circ
\]

#### Step 4: Determine \(\angle BAF\)
The angle \(x\) is the same as \(\angle FAD\) because both are formed by the same lines (AF and AB) at point A. Therefore:
\[
x = \angle FAD = 23^\circ
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the Calculation
- The total angle around point A in the right angle is \(90^\circ\).
- Subtracting the given angle \(\angle CAD = 67^\circ\) leaves \(23^\circ\) for \(\angle FAD\).
- This confirms that \(x = 23^\circ\).

---

### Solution Section:

Based on the geometric relationships and calculations:
\[
x = 23^\circ
\]

Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 23
- B. 30
- C. 67
- D. 90

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
