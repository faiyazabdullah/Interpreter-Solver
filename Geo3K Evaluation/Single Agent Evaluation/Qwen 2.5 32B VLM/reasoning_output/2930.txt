### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the given information
The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle JKL \) with the following details:
- \( \angle L = 90^\circ \) (indicated by the right angle symbol).
- Side \( JK = 14 \) (the hypotenuse).
- Side \( KL = 9 \) (one of the legs).

We are tasked with finding the measure of \( \angle J \) to the nearest degree.

#### Step 2: Identify the relationship between the sides and angles
In a right triangle, the trigonometric ratios (sine, cosine, tangent) relate the angles to the sides. Specifically:
- \( \sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} \)
- \( \cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} \)
- \( \tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} \)

Here, \( \angle J \) is opposite side \( KL \) and adjacent to side \( JL \). However, we do not know the length of \( JL \) directly. Instead, we can use the sine or cosine ratio since we have the hypotenuse \( JK \) and one leg \( KL \).

#### Step 3: Choose the appropriate trigonometric function
Since we know the hypotenuse \( JK \) and the side opposite \( \angle J \) (which is \( KL \)), we can use the sine function:
\[
\sin(\angle J) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{KL}{JK} = \frac{9}{14}
\]

#### Step 4: Solve for \( \angle J \)
To find \( \angle J \), we need to take the inverse sine ( arcsin ) of \( \frac{9}{14} \):
\[
\angle J = \arcsin\left(\frac{9}{14}\right)
\]

#### Step 5: Use a calculator
Using a calculator:
\[
\arcsin\left(\frac{9}{14}\right) \approx 40.54^\circ
\]

#### Step 6: Round to the nearest degree
Rounding \( 40.54^\circ \) to the nearest degree gives:
\[
\angle J \approx 41^\circ
\]

#### Step 7: Compare with the answer choices
The answer choices are:
A. 33
B. 40
C. 50
D. 57

The closest value to \( 41^\circ \) is \( 40^\circ \).

### Solution Section

Based on the calculations and rounding, the measure of \( \angle J \) to the nearest degree is \( 40^\circ \).
