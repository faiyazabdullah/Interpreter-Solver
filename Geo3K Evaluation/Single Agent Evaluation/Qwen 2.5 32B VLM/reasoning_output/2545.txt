### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Image and Identify Given Information
- The image shows a large semicircle with a diameter of 15 units.
- Inside the large semicircle, there are three smaller semicircles, each touching the larger semicircle and the line segment \( AE \).
- The centers of the smaller semicircles are labeled \( F \), \( C \), and \( G \).
- The total length of the line segment \( AE \) is 15 units.

#### Step 2: Determine the Radius of the Large Semicircle
- The diameter of the large semicircle is given as 15 units.
- Therefore, the radius \( R \) of the large semicircle is:
  \[
  R = \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \text{ units}
  \]

#### Step 3: Determine the Radii of the Smaller Semicircles
- Since the three smaller semicircles are identical and their diameters add up to the total length of \( AE \), each smaller semicircle has a diameter of:
  \[
  \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ units}
  \]
- Therefore, the radius \( r \) of each smaller semicircle is:
  \[
  r = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \text{ units}
  \]

#### Step 4: Calculate the Area of the Large Semicircle
- The area \( A_{\text{large}} \) of a full circle with radius \( R = 7.5 \) is:
  \[
  A_{\text{full circle}} = \pi R^2 = \pi (7.5)^2 = \pi \cdot 56.25
  \]
- The area of the large semicircle is half of this:
  \[
  A_{\text{large semicircle}} = \frac{1}{2} \pi (7.5)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi \cdot 56.25 = 28.125\pi
  \]

#### Step 5: Calculate the Area of One Smaller Semicircle
- The area \( A_{\text{small}} \) of a full circle with radius \( r = 2.5 \) is:
  \[
  A_{\text{full small circle}} = \pi r^2 = \pi (2.5)^2 = \pi \cdot 6.25
  \]
- The area of one smaller semicircle is half of this:
  \[
  A_{\text{small semicircle}} = \frac{1}{2} \pi (2.5)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi \cdot 6.25 = 3.125\pi
  \]

#### Step 6: Calculate the Total Area of the Three Smaller Semicircles
- Since there are three smaller semicircles, the total area \( A_{\text{small total}} \) is:
  \[
  A_{\text{small total}} = 3 \cdot 3.125\pi = 9.375\pi
  \]

#### Step 7: Calculate the Area of the Shaded Region
- The shaded region is the area of the large semicircle minus the combined area of the three smaller semicircles:
  \[
  A_{\text{shaded}} = A_{\text{large semicircle}} - A_{\text{small total}}
  \]
  \[
  A_{\text{shaded}} = 28.125\pi - 9.375\pi = 18.75\pi
  \]

#### Step 8: Approximate the Area Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \)
- Substitute \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \) into the expression for \( A_{\text{shaded}} \):
  \[
  A_{\text{shaded}} \approx 18.75 \cdot 3.14159 \approx 58.875
  \]
- Round to the nearest tenth:
  \[
  A_{\text{shaded}} \approx 58.9
  \]

### Solution Section

Based on the calculations above, the area of the shaded region is approximately \( 58.9 \).
