### Problem Analysis:
The problem states that \( \triangle BCD \cong \triangle WXY \). This means the triangles are congruent, which implies that corresponding sides and angles are equal. We are tasked with finding the value of \( x \) based on the given information.

#### Step 1: Identify Given Information
From the image:
- In \( \triangle BCD \):
  - \( \angle C = (20x - 4)^\circ \)
  - \( \angle B = (24x + 5)^\circ \)
  - Side \( BD = 11 \)

- In \( \triangle WXY \):
  - \( \angle W = 77^\circ \)
  - \( WX = 2x + 5 \)
  - \( XY = 77 \) (Note: This side length is not directly relevant to the angle calculations but is included for completeness.)

#### Step 2: Use Congruence Properties
Since \( \triangle BCD \cong \triangle WXY \), the corresponding angles and sides are equal. Specifically:
- \( \angle C \) in \( \triangle BCD \) corresponds to \( \angle W \) in \( \triangle WXY \).
- \( \angle B \) in \( \triangle BCD \) corresponds to another angle in \( \triangle WXY \) (which we will determine).

Thus, we have:
\[ \angle C = \angle W \]
\[ (20x - 4)^\circ = 77^\circ \]

#### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
From the equation \( (20x - 4)^\circ = 77^\circ \):
1. Add 4 to both sides:
   \[
   20x - 4 + 4 = 77 + 4
   \]
   \[
   20x = 81
   \]
2. Divide both sides by 20:
   \[
   x = \frac{81}{20}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4.05
   \]

#### Step 4: Verify the Solution
We need to ensure that the value of \( x = 4.05 \) is consistent with the given conditions. Since the answer choices are integers, we compare \( x = 4.05 \) with the closest integer values in the options.

- Option A: \( x = 2 \)
- Option B: \( x = 3 \)
- Option C: \( x = 4 \)
- Option D: \( x = 5 \)

The closest integer to \( x = 4.05 \) is \( x = 4 \).

#### Step 5: Final Answer
Based on the calculations and the closest integer value, the correct answer is:

\[
\boxed{C}
\]

### Final Answer: C
