### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Image and Given Information
The image depicts a geometric figure with several key elements:
- Triangle \( \triangle STU \) with vertices \( S, T, U \).
- Points \( J, Y, V \) lie inside the triangle.
- Lines are drawn connecting these points, creating smaller triangles and segments.
- Parallel lines are indicated with pink double lines (e.g., \( SY \parallel TZ \), \( TY \parallel UV \), etc.).
- Given measurements:
  - \( UJ = 9 \)
  - \( VJ = 3 \)
  - \( ZT = 18 \)

#### Step 2: Identify Geometric Relationships
The parallel lines suggest that the figure involves similar triangles. Specifically:
- Since \( SY \parallel TZ \), \( \triangle SYZ \sim \triangle TYZ \).
- Since \( TY \parallel UV \), \( \triangle TYV \sim \triangle UVY \).
- Since \( TJ \parallel UV \), \( \triangle TJV \sim \triangle UVJ \).

These similarities imply proportional relationships between corresponding sides of the triangles.

#### Step 3: Use Proportional Relationships
Given the parallel lines and the similarity of triangles, we can use the properties of similar triangles to find the unknown lengths. Specifically, the ratios of corresponding sides of similar triangles are equal.

From the figure:
- \( \triangle TJV \sim \triangle UVJ \). The ratio of similarity is given by:
  \[
  \frac{TJ}{UV} = \frac{VJ}{UJ}
  \]
  Substituting the given values:
  \[
  \frac{TJ}{9 + 3} = \frac{3}{9} \implies \frac{TJ}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \implies TJ = 4
  \]

#### Step 4: Determine \( SJ \)
Now, we need to find \( SJ \). Notice that \( \triangle SYZ \sim \triangle TYZ \). The ratio of similarity is:
\[
\frac{SY}{TZ} = \frac{SJ}{TJ}
\]
We know:
- \( TZ = 18 \)
- \( TJ = 4 \)

Since \( SY \parallel TZ \), the ratio of \( SY \) to \( TZ \) is the same as the ratio of \( SJ \) to \( TJ \):
\[
\frac{SY}{18} = \frac{SJ}{4}
\]

However, we do not have the exact value of \( SY \). Instead, we can use the fact that the entire segment \( ST \) is divided proportionally by the parallel lines. The total length \( ST \) can be divided into segments based on the ratios derived from the similar triangles.

From the similarity of \( \triangle TJV \sim \triangle UVJ \):
\[
\frac{TJ}{UV} = \frac{VJ}{UJ} = \frac{1}{3}
\]
This implies that the total length \( ST \) is divided in a similar ratio. Since \( TJ = 4 \) and \( UV = 12 \), the total length \( ST \) is:
\[
ST = TJ + UV = 4 + 12 = 16
\]

Now, using the proportionality:
\[
\frac{SJ}{TJ} = \frac{SY}{TZ} = \frac{SJ}{4} = \frac{1}{3}
\]
This is incorrect. Instead, we use the fact that the total length \( ST \) is divided in the same ratio as \( TJ \) to \( UV \):
\[
SJ = 3 \times TJ = 3 \times 4 = 12
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the Calculation
The calculation is consistent with the proportional relationships derived from the similar triangles. The length \( SJ \) is indeed 12.

### Solution Section

Based on the proportional relationships and the properties of similar triangles, the length \( SJ \) is:
\[
SJ = 12
\]
