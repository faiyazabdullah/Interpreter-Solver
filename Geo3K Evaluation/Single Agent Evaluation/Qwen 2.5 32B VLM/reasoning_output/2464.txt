### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a geometric figure with the following key elements:
1. **Line Segment \( XZ \)**: The line segment \( XZ \) is the primary focus.
2. **Point \( Y \)**: Point \( Y \) lies on the line \( m \), which is indicated as the perpendicular bisector of \( XZ \).
3. **Perpendicular Bisector \( m \)**: The line \( m \) is perpendicular to \( XZ \) and bisects it, meaning \( XY = YZ \).
4. **Point \( W \)**: Point \( W \) lies on the same horizontal line as \( Y \), and the distance \( WZ = 14.9 \) is given.
5. **Goal**: Find the length of \( WX \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Perpendicular Bisector Property**
- Since \( m \) is the perpendicular bisector of \( XZ \), it divides \( XZ \) into two equal parts: \( XY = YZ \).
- This implies that \( Y \) is the midpoint of \( XZ \).

#### **Step 2: Analyze the Coordinates and Distances**
- Let the coordinates of points be as follows (for simplicity):
  - \( Y \) is the midpoint of \( XZ \).
  - \( W \) lies horizontally on the same line as \( Y \).
  - \( WZ = 14.9 \).

#### **Step 3: Use the Perpendicular Bisector Property**
- Since \( Y \) is the midpoint of \( XZ \), the distances from \( Y \) to \( X \) and \( Z \) are equal: \( XY = YZ \).
- The total length \( XZ \) is twice the length \( YZ \): \( XZ = 2 \cdot YZ \).

#### **Step 4: Relate \( WZ \) to \( WX \)**
- The point \( W \) is horizontally aligned with \( Y \), and the distance \( WZ = 14.9 \).
- Since \( Y \) is the midpoint of \( XZ \), the distance \( WY \) is part of \( WX \).
- By symmetry and the properties of the perpendicular bisector, \( WX = WZ \).

#### **Step 5: Calculate \( WX \)**
- From the given information, \( WZ = 14.9 \).
- Since \( WX = WZ \) due to the symmetry and properties of the perpendicular bisector, we have:
  \[
  WX = WZ = 14.9
  \]

### Final Answer:
The length of \( WX \) is \( 14.9 \).

\[
\boxed{B}
\]
