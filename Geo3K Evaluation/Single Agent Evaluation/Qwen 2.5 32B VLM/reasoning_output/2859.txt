### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
The image shows a parallelogram with the following details:
- One side length is labeled as \(12 \, \text{m}\).
- Another side length is labeled as \(10 \, \text{m}\).
- An angle between these sides is given as \(60^\circ\).
- The height (altitude) corresponding to the base of \(12 \, \text{m}\) is shown but not directly labeled.

#### Step 2: Identify the Task
We need to find the **perimeter** of the parallelogram. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a parallelogram is:
\[
P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
\]
Here, the "length" and "width" are the two different side lengths of the parallelogram.

#### Step 3: Use Geometric Properties
- In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. Therefore, the side lengths are \(12 \, \text{m}\) and \(10 \, \text{m}\).
- The perimeter can be directly calculated using the formula since both pairs of opposite sides are equal.

#### Step 4: Calculate the Perimeter
Using the formula for the perimeter:
\[
P = 2 \times (12 + 10) = 2 \times 22 = 44 \, \text{m}
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the Calculation
- The given side lengths are \(12 \, \text{m}\) and \(10 \, \text{m}\).
- Since opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal, the sides are \(12 \, \text{m}, 10 \, \text{m}, 12 \, \text{m}, 10 \, \text{m}\).
- Summing these gives \(12 + 10 + 12 + 10 = 44 \, \text{m}\).

#### Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated perimeter is \(44 \, \text{m}\). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 22
- B. 40
- C. 44
- D. 48

The closest match is **C. 44**.

### Solution Section

The perimeter of the parallelogram is calculated as follows:
\[
P = 2 \times (12 + 10) = 2 \times 22 = 44 \, \text{m}
\]

Final Answer: **C**
