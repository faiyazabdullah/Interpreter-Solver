### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the given information
- The problem states that \( \triangle ABC \sim \triangle FDG \). This means the triangles are similar, and their corresponding sides are proportional.
- From the image:
  - In \( \triangle ABC \):
    - One side is labeled as \( AB = 15 \).
    - Another side is labeled as \( x \).
  - In \( \triangle FDG \):
    - One side is labeled as \( DF = 12 \).
    - Another side is labeled as \( FG = 8 \).

#### Step 2: Identify the corresponding sides
- Since the triangles are similar, the sides must be proportional. We need to determine which sides correspond to each other.
- From the image, the sides marked with the same number of tick marks are likely corresponding sides. Therefore:
  - \( AB \) corresponds to \( DF \) (both have no tick marks).
  - \( AC \) corresponds to \( FD \) (both have one tick mark).
  - \( BC \) corresponds to \( DG \) (both have two tick marks).

#### Step 3: Set up the proportionality relationship
- The similarity of triangles implies:
  \[
  \frac{AB}{DF} = \frac{AC}{FD} = \frac{BC}{DG}
  \]
- We are given:
  - \( AB = 15 \)
  - \( DF = 12 \)
  - \( AC = x \)
  - \( FD = 12 \) (redundant, but confirms the correspondence)
  - \( FG = 8 \) (not directly used here, but helps visualize the triangle)

#### Step 4: Use the proportion involving \( x \)
- The proportion involving \( x \) is:
  \[
  \frac{AB}{DF} = \frac{AC}{FD}
  \]
- Substituting the known values:
  \[
  \frac{15}{12} = \frac{x}{8}
  \]

#### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)
- Cross-multiply to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  15 \cdot 8 = 12 \cdot x
  \]
  \[
  120 = 12x
  \]
  \[
  x = \frac{120}{12} = 10
  \]

#### Step 6: Verify the solution
- The proportion \( \frac{15}{12} = \frac{10}{8} \) simplifies to \( \frac{5}{4} = \frac{5}{4} \), which is true. Thus, the solution is consistent.

### Solution Section

Based on the above steps, the value of \( x \) is \( 10 \).
