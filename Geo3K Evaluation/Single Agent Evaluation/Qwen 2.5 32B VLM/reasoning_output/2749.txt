### Problem Analysis:
The given problem involves a geometric figure where we need to determine the length of \( ZX \) based on the expressions for segments \( ZP \) and \( PY \). Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

#### **Step 1: Analyze the Image**
- The image shows a quadrilateral \( ZWXY \) with diagonal \( ZY \).
- Point \( P \) lies on the diagonal \( ZY \).
- The lengths of segments \( ZP \) and \( PY \) are given as functions of \( x \):
  - \( ZP = 4x - 9 \)
  - \( PY = 2x + 5 \)

#### **Step 2: Understand the Relationships**
- Since \( P \) lies on the diagonal \( ZY \), the total length of \( ZY \) can be expressed as the sum of \( ZP \) and \( PY \):
  \[
  ZY = ZP + PY
  \]

#### **Step 3: Express \( ZY \) in Terms of \( x \)**
Using the given expressions for \( ZP \) and \( PY \):
\[
ZY = (4x - 9) + (2x + 5)
\]
Simplify:
\[
ZY = 4x - 9 + 2x + 5 = 6x - 4
\]

#### **Step 4: Determine \( ZX \)**
- The problem asks for the length \( ZX \). From the image, \( ZX \) is one side of the rectangle \( ZWXY \).
- In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. Therefore, \( ZX = WY \).

#### **Step 5: Use Symmetry and Proportional Relationships**
- The diagonal \( ZY \) splits the rectangle into two congruent right triangles.
- The coordinates or proportions of the segments \( ZP \) and \( PY \) do not directly affect the length of \( ZX \) because \( ZX \) is a side of the rectangle, not part of the diagonal.
- However, the problem does not provide direct measurements for the sides of the rectangle. Instead, it relies on the relationship between \( ZP \) and \( PY \).

#### **Step 6: Solve for \( x \) Using Given Information**
- The problem does not provide additional constraints or measurements for \( ZX \) directly. Instead, it asks us to find \( ZX \) based on the expressions for \( ZP \) and \( PY \).
- Since \( ZX \) is a side of the rectangle and not directly related to the diagonal segments, we need to infer its value based on the context of the problem.

#### **Step 7: Revisit the Problem**
- The expressions for \( ZP \) and \( PY \) suggest that \( x \) is a variable that determines the lengths of these segments.
- However, the problem does not provide enough information to solve for \( x \) explicitly. Instead, it seems to test the understanding of the relationship between the segments and the overall structure of the rectangle.

#### **Step 8: Consider the Answer Choices**
- The answer choices are numerical values: \( 9, 10, 19, 38 \).
- Since the problem does not provide direct measurements for \( ZX \), we must infer that the value of \( ZX \) is consistent with the given expressions for \( ZP \) and \( PY \).

#### **Step 9: Logical Inference**
- The expressions \( ZP = 4x - 9 \) and \( PY = 2x + 5 \) suggest that \( ZY = 6x - 4 \).
- Without additional constraints, we cannot solve for \( x \) explicitly. However, the problem likely intends for us to use the symmetry and proportional relationships in the rectangle.
- Given the answer choices, the most reasonable inference is that \( ZX \) is a fixed value consistent with the structure of the rectangle.

### Solution:
After analyzing the problem and the given expressions, the most reasonable inference is that \( ZX \) is a fixed value consistent with the symmetry of the rectangle. The correct answer choice is:

\[
\boxed{D}
\]
