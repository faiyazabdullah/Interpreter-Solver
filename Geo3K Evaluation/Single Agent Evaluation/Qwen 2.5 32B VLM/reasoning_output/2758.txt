### Problem Analysis:
The given image shows a trapezoid \( G H J K \) with the following details:
- The lengths of the parallel sides (bases) are:
  - Top base \( GH = 17 \) meters
  - Bottom base \( KJ = 13 \) meters
- The area of the trapezoid is given as \( 75 \) square meters.
- We need to find the height of the trapezoid.

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Understanding the Formula for the Area of a Trapezoid
The formula for the area of a trapezoid is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{Base}_1 + \text{Base}_2) \times \text{Height}
\]
Here:
- \(\text{Base}_1 = GH = 17\) meters
- \(\text{Base}_2 = KJ = 13\) meters
- \(\text{Area} = 75\) square meters
- \(\text{Height} = h\) (to be determined)

#### Step 2: Substituting Known Values into the Formula
Substitute the known values into the area formula:
\[
75 = \frac{1}{2} \times (17 + 13) \times h
\]

#### Step 3: Simplifying the Expression
First, calculate the sum of the bases:
\[
17 + 13 = 30
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
75 = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 \times h
\]

#### Step 4: Solving for the Height
Simplify further:
\[
75 = 15 \times h
\]
Divide both sides by 15 to isolate \( h \):
\[
h = \frac{75}{15} = 5
\]

#### Step 5: Verifying the Calculation
The height \( h = 5 \) meters satisfies the area formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (17 + 13) \times 5 = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 \times 5 = 75 \text{ square meters}
\]
This matches the given area, confirming the correctness of the calculation.

#### Step 6: Comparing with Answer Choices
The calculated height is \( 5 \) meters. The answer choices are:
A. 2.5
B. 3
C. 5
D. 7.5

The correct answer is \( 5 \), which corresponds to choice C.

### Solution Section:
The height of the trapezoid is \( 5 \) meters. Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
