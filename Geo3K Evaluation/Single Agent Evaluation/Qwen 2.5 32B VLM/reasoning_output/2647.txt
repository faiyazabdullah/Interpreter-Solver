### Thought Section

#### Step 1: Analyze the Image
The image shows two parallel lines \( m \) and \( n \), intersected by a transversal line. The angles formed at the intersection points are labeled with expressions involving \( x \):
- At point \( B \), the angle on line \( m \) is labeled as \( (4x - 23)^\circ \).
- At point \( E \), the corresponding angle on line \( n \) is labeled as \( (2x + 17)^\circ \).

Since \( m \parallel n \), the corresponding angles formed by the transversal are equal. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
(4x - 23) = (2x + 17)
\]

#### Step 2: Solve for \( x \)
We need to solve the equation:
\[
4x - 23 = 2x + 17
\]

1. Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:
\[
4x - 2x - 23 = 17
\]
\[
2x - 23 = 17
\]

2. Add 23 to both sides:
\[
2x = 40
\]

3. Divide both sides by 2:
\[
x = 20
\]

#### Step 3: Verify the Solution
To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 20 \) back into the expressions for the angles:
- For the angle on line \( m \):
\[
4x - 23 = 4(20) - 23 = 80 - 23 = 57^\circ
\]
- For the angle on line \( n \):
\[
2x + 17 = 2(20) + 17 = 40 + 17 = 57^\circ
\]

Both angles are equal, confirming that \( m \parallel n \) when \( x = 20 \).

#### Step 4: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated value of \( x \) is 20. Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 10
- B. 20
- C. 31
- D. 40

The correct answer is \( x = 20 \), which corresponds to choice B.

### Solution Section

The value of \( x \) that ensures \( m \parallel n \) is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]
