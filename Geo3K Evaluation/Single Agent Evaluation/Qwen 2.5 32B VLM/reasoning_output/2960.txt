### Problem Analysis:
The given image depicts a triangle \( \triangle STR \) with the following details:
- Side lengths: \( ST = 4 \), \( TR = 3 \), and \( SR = 5 \).
- A right angle at vertex \( T \), indicated by the red square symbol.

We are tasked with finding \( \sin S \).

### Thought Section:

#### Step 1: Identify the type of triangle
The presence of a right angle at \( T \) indicates that \( \triangle STR \) is a right triangle with \( \angle T = 90^\circ \). In a right triangle, the trigonometric ratios (sine, cosine, tangent) can be directly computed using the side lengths.

#### Step 2: Label the sides
In a right triangle:
- The side opposite the right angle is the hypotenuse.
- The other two sides are the legs.

From the image:
- \( SR = 5 \) is the hypotenuse.
- \( ST = 4 \) is one leg.
- \( TR = 3 \) is the other leg.

#### Step 3: Recall the definition of sine
The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as:
\[
\sin(\text{angle}) = \frac{\text{opposite side}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]

For \( \sin S \):
- The angle \( S \) is at vertex \( S \).
- The side opposite \( S \) is \( TR \) (the leg adjacent to \( S \)).
- The hypotenuse is \( SR \).

Thus:
\[
\sin S = \frac{\text{opposite side to } S}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{TR}{SR}
\]

#### Step 4: Substitute the known values
From the image:
- \( TR = 3 \)
- \( SR = 5 \)

Therefore:
\[
\sin S = \frac{3}{5}
\]

#### Step 5: Compare with the answer choices
The value of \( \sin S \) is \( \frac{3}{5} = 0.6 \).

The answer choices are:
A. 0.2
B. 0.4
C. 0.6
D. 0.8

#### Step 6: Select the correct answer
The calculated value \( 0.6 \) matches option C.

### Solution Section:

Based on the analysis and calculations:
\[
\sin S = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6
\]

Final Answer: **C**
