Let's analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the given information**: The image shows a triangle ABC with point D on side AB extended beyond B. There are arcs and points marked, but no specific lengths or angle measures are provided directly.

2. **Understand the relationships**: 
   - Point D is on the extension of AB.
   - Arcs suggest some angles might be involved, but without specific measures, we need to look for other geometric properties.

3. **Identify what needs to be found**: The question asks us to find \(x\). Given the options, it seems \(x\) could be an angle measure.

4. **Apply geometric theorems**:
   - The straight line through D extends AB, so angle BDC appears to be a straight angle (180 degrees).
   - Since point D lies on the extension of AB, angle BDC = 180 degrees.
   - However, the problem does not explicitly give enough information about angles B and C. Without additional angle measures, we cannot directly calculate \(x\).

5. **Revisit the problem**: Since there is no direct angle measurement provided and the options suggest a specific numerical value for \(x\), let's consider the closest possible value among the choices given.

Given the lack of specific angle measures or further constraints, the closest reasonable answer from the provided choices would be:
