<think>
First, let's analyze the given geometric figure. We have a triangle \( \triangle WRS \) and a line segment \( RT \). The lengths of certain sides are given: \( WS = 8 \), \( RV = 10 \), and \( WT = 2x + 6 \). We need to find the length of \( WR \).

Given the options, we can infer that \( WR \) might be directly related to the given side lengths. Since the problem does not specify any specific type of triangle (like right, isosceles, etc.), we assume the simplest case for finding the length of \( WR \).

We can use the fact that the total length of \( WT \) can be split into segments \( WR \) and \( RT \). Since \( RT \) is expressed as \( 2x + 6 \), we need to find \( x \) first. However, without additional information about the relationship between \( x \) and the other segments, we can only make assumptions based on the given options.

Let's check each option:

- If \( WR = 6 \), then \( RT = 2(6) + 6 = 18 \).
- If \( WR = 8 \), then \( RT = 2(8) + 6 = 22 \).
- If \( WR = 10 \), then \( RT = 2(10) + 6 = 26 \).
- If \( WR = 12 \), then \( RT = 2(12) + 6 = 30 \).

Since the total length of \( WT \) must be consistent with these values, we need to find which value fits best within the constraints of the problem. Given the options and the typical lengths in such problems, \( WR = 8 \) seems to fit the pattern and constraints of the problem.

Therefore, the most plausible value for \( WR \) is 8.

Solution Section:
Based on the analysis, the length of \( WR \) is 8. Therefore, the correct answer is:
