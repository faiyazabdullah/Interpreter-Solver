To solve for \(x\) in the given rectangle \(ABCD\), we need to use the fact that the sum of the interior angles at point \(E\) (where the diagonals intersect) is \(180^\circ\). Since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, the diagonals bisect each other and form right angles at \(E\).

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the given angles**:
   - \(\angle AED = (2x + 1)^\circ\)
   - \(\angle BEC = (5x + 5)^\circ\)
   - \(\angle DEC = (y^2)^\circ\)
   - \(\angle AEB = (3y + 10)^\circ\)

2. **Sum of angles around point \(E\)**:
   Since these angles form a straight line, their sum must be \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   (2x + 1) + (5x + 5) + y^2 + (3y + 10) = 180
   \]

3. **Combine like terms**:
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2x + 5x + y^2 + 3y + 1 + 5 + 10 = 180
   \]
   \[
   7x + y^2 + 3y + 16 = 180
   \]

4. **Isolate \(x\)**:
   Rearrange the equation to solve for \(x\):
   \[
   7x + y^2 + 3y + 16 = 180
   \]
   \[
   7x = 180 - y^2 - 3y - 16
   \]
   \[
   7x = 164 - y^2 - 3y
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{164 - y^2 - 3y}{7}
   \]

Since the problem does not provide a value for \(y\), let's assume \(y\) is a constant that fits within the given choices. Given the options, we can test the values of \(x\):

- If \(x = 5\):
  \[
  7(5) = 164 - y^2 - 3y
  \]
  \[
  35 = 164 - y^2 - 3y
  \]
  \[
  y^2 + 3y - 129 = 0
  \]
  Solving this quadratic equation will give us \(y\), but it's not necessary since we are asked to find \(x\).

- If \(x = 12\):
  \[
  7(12) = 164 - y^2 - 3y
  \]
  \[
  84 = 164 - y^2 - 3y
  \]
  \[
  y^2 + 3y - 80 = 0
  \]
  Solving this quadratic equation will give us \(y\).

- If \(x = 24\):
  \[
  7(24) = 164 - y^2 - 3y
  \]
  \[
  168 = 164 - y^2 - 3y
  \]
  \[
  y^2 + 3y - 4 = 0
  \]
  Solving this quadratic equation will give us \(y\).

- If \(x = 25\):
  \[
  7(25) = 164 - y^2 - 3y
  \]
  \[
  175 = 164 - y^2 - 3y
  \]
  \[
  y^2 + 3y - 11 = 0
  \]
  Solving this quadratic equation will give us \(y\).

Given the problem constraints and the choices, the closest value for \(x\) that fits without needing additional \(y\) calculation is \(x = 5\).
