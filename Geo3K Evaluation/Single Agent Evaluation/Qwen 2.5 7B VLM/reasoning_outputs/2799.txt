To solve this problem, we need to analyze the geometric relationships and use the given information about the chords and the circle's radius.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Chords \(AC\) and \(DF\) are equidistant from the center \(G\).
   - The radius of \(\odot G\) is 26.

2. **Understand the implications:**
   - Since \(AC\) and \(DF\) are equidistant from the center, they are both perpendicular to the line segment joining their midpoints and pass through the center \(G\).

3. **Visualize the setup:**
   - The chords \(AC\) and \(DF\) are diameters because they are perpendicular to each other and pass through the center.
   - The distance between the midpoints of these chords (which is the same as the length of the chord connecting the endpoints of the radii perpendicular to \(AC\) and \(DF\)) is given as 10.

4. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem:**
   - Let the midpoint of \(AC\) be \(M\) and the midpoint of \(DF\) be \(N\). Since \(AC\) and \(DF\) are perpendicular and equidistant, the distance \(MN = 10\).
   - The radius \(r = 26\), so half the radius for each chord is \(13\).

5. **Form a right triangle:**
   - Consider the right triangle formed by the radius, the distance from the center to the midpoint of the chord, and half the length of the chord.
   - The hypotenuse of this triangle is the radius \(26\), and the legs are \(13\) (half the radius) and \(10\) (the distance between the midpoints).

6. **Calculate the length of \(AC\):**
   - The length of \(AC\) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the radius, the distance from the center to the midpoint, and half the length of the chord.
   - The full length of the chord \(AC\) will be twice the distance from the center to the midpoint of \(AC\).

Let's calculate the length of \(AC\):

\[
AC = 2 \times \sqrt{26^2 - 10^2}
\]

\[
AC = 2 \times \sqrt{676 - 100}
\]

\[
AC = 2 \times \sqrt{576}
\]

\[
AC = 2 \times 24
\]

\[
AC = 48
\]

</think>

**Solution:**

The length of \(AC\) is \(48\).
