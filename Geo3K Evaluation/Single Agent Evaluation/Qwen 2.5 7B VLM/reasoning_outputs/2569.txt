Let's analyze the given geometric figure:

1. **Identify the given angles**: The image shows two angles labeled as 110° and 150°.
2. **Understand the relationship**: These angles appear to be inscribed angles subtended by arcs in a circle. We need to find angle 5.
3. **Sum of angles around a point**: The sum of angles around a point is always 360°.
4. **Inscribed angle theorem**: An inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts.

Given these points, we need to determine how these angles relate to each other and the intercepted arcs.

**Step-by-step solution:**

1. The total measure of the circle is 360°.
2. The sum of the given angles (110° + 150°) is 260°.
3. The remaining angle in the circle would be \(360° - 260° = 100°\).

However, angle 5 appears to be related to these angles but isn't directly given. It seems to be an inscribed angle subtending a specific arc. Let's assume the intercepted arc corresponding to angle 5 is half of the remaining arc measure.

If we consider the remaining arc as 100°, then the inscribed angle subtending this arc would be half of 100°, which is 50°.

Thus, angle 5 is likely 50°.

**Solution:**

Based on the analysis, angle 5 is approximately 50°.
