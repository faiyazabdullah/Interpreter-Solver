To solve this problem, let's break down the given information and apply the relevant geometric principles:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \( ZP = 4x - 9 \)
   - \( PY = 2x + 5 \)

2. **Understand the relationship between these segments:**
   - Since \( ZP \) and \( PY \) are segments forming part of the diagonal of a rectangle (as indicated by the right angle at point W), they together form the diagonal \( ZY \).

3. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem:**
   - In a rectangle, the diagonal forms a right triangle with the sides \( ZX \) and \( XY \).
   - Therefore, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the lengths of the segments:
     \[
     ZY^2 = ZX^2 + XY^2
     \]

4. **Express the lengths in terms of \( x \):**
   - Let \( ZX = y \) and \( XY = z \).
   - Given \( ZY = ZP + PY \):
     \[
     ZY = (4x - 9) + (2x + 5) = 6x - 4
     \]

5. **Set up the equation using the Pythagorean theorem:**
   \[
   (6x - 4)^2 = y^2 + z^2
   \]

6. **Solve for \( y \) and \( z \):**
   - We need to find the value of \( y \) which is \( ZX \).

Let's calculate \( y \):

\[
(6x - 4)^2 = y^2 + z^2
\]

Since the problem does not provide additional information about \( y \) and \( z \), we assume \( y = z \) (a common simplification in such problems unless otherwise stated). Thus:

\[
(6x - 4)^2 = 2y^2
\]

Simplify:

\[
36x^2 - 48x + 16 = 2y^2
\]

Since we need \( y \):

\[
y^2 = \frac{36x^2 - 48x + 16}{2}
\]

Given the complexity, let's test the closest integer values from the choices to find a fit.

Testing \( x = 3 \):

\[
ZP = 4(3) - 9 = 3
\]
\[
PY = 2(3) + 5 = 11
\]
\[
ZY = 3 + 11 = 14
\]

Using \( x = 3 \):

\[
y^2 = \frac{36(3)^2 - 48(3) + 16}{2} = \frac{36 \cdot 9 - 144 + 16}{2} = \frac{324 - 144 + 16}{2} = \frac{196}{2} = 98
\]

Thus, \( y = \sqrt{98} \approx 10 \).

Therefore, the closest value to our calculated result is:
