To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the midsegment and the sides of the triangle it forms.

1. **Identify the Midsegment**: X Y and X Z are midsegments of triangle RST. According to the Midsegment Theorem, a midsegment of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.

2. **Given Information**:
   - XY = 7
   - RT = 13

3. **Midsegment Theorem Application**:
   - Since X Y and X Z are midsegments, they are parallel to RT and ST respectively.
   - Therefore, XY || RT and XZ || ST.
   - According to the Midsegment Theorem, XY = 1/2 * RT and XZ = 1/2 * ST.

4. **Calculate ST**:
   - From the Midsegment Theorem, XY = 1/2 * RT.
   - Substituting the given values: 7 = 1/2 * 13.
   - Solving for RT: RT = 13.
   - Since XZ = 1/2 * ST, we need to find ST.
   - Let's assume XZ = ST (since XZ and ST are part of the same triangle and both are midsegments).
   - Therefore, ST = 2 * XY = 2 * 7 = 14.

So, the length of ST is 14.
