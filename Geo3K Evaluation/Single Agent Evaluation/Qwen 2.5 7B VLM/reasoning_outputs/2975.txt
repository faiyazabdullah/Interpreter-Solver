To solve this problem, we need to use the geometric property related to the tangent and radius of a circle. Specifically, the length of the tangent from a point outside the circle to the point of tangency is equal to the length of the tangent from the same point to another point on the circle.

Given:
- \( MO = 20 \)
- \( MP = 16 \)
- \( PB = 5 \)

We need to find the length of \( x \), which is the radius of the circle.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify the Tangent Properties:**
   - Since \( MP \) is a tangent to the circle at point \( P \) and \( PB \) is also a tangent to the circle at point \( B \), we can use the tangent-tangent theorem which states that the lengths of the tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal.

2. **Apply the Tangent-Tangent Theorem:**
   - According to the theorem, \( MP = PB \).
   - Therefore, \( MP = 16 \) and \( PB = 5 \).

3. **Calculate \( x \):**
   - The length of the tangent from \( M \) to the point of tangency \( P \) is \( MP = 16 \).
   - The length of the tangent from \( M \) to the center \( O \) is \( MO = 20 \).

4. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   - Since \( OP \) is the radius of the circle, we can consider triangle \( MOP \) as a right triangle with \( MP \) as one leg, \( MO \) as the hypotenuse, and \( OP \) as the other leg.
   - Using the Pythagorean theorem: \( MO^2 = MP^2 + OP^2 \).
   - Substitute the known values: \( 20^2 = 16^2 + x^2 \).
   - Simplify: \( 400 = 256 + x^2 \).
   - Solve for \( x^2 \): \( x^2 = 400 - 256 \).
   - \( x^2 = 144 \).
   - Take the square root: \( x = \sqrt{144} \).
   - \( x = 12 \).

### Conclusion:
The value of \( x \) is 12.
