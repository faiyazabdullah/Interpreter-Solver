First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric figure:

1. The figure appears to be a circle with a diameter labeled as 6.2 cm.
2. The endpoints of the diameter are marked as points B and C, and the center of the circle is marked as point A.
3. We need to find the area of the circle.

Given that the diameter of the circle is 6.2 cm, we can calculate the radius (r) as half of the diameter:
\[ r = \frac{d}{2} = \frac{6.2}{2} = 3.1 \text{ cm} \]

The formula for the area (A) of a circle is:
\[ A = \pi r^2 \]

Substituting the radius into the formula:
\[ A = \pi (3.1)^2 \]
\[ A = \pi \times 9.61 \]
\[ A \approx 3.14 \times 9.61 \]
\[ A \approx 30.2 \]

Now, comparing our calculated area with the given answer choices:
A. 19.5
B. 30.2
C. 60.4
D. 120.8

The closest value to our calculated area of approximately 30.2 cmÂ² is option B.
