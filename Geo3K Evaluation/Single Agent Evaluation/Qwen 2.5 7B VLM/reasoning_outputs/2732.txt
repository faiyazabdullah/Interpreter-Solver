To solve this problem, let's analyze the given information and apply geometric principles:

1. **Identify the given information**: We have a square inscribed in a circle with a radius of 6 inches.
2. **Understand the relationship between the square and the circle**: When a square is inscribed in a circle, the diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle.
3. **Calculate the diagonal of the square**: The diameter of the circle is twice the radius, so the diameter is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) inches.
4. **Relate the diagonal to the side length of the square**: The diagonal of the square forms a right triangle with two sides of the square. If we denote the side length of the square as \(s\), then the diagonal \(d\) can be expressed using the Pythagorean theorem: \(d = s\sqrt{2}\).
5. **Set up the equation**: Since the diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle, we have \(s\sqrt{2} = 12\).
6. **Solve for \(s\)**: Divide both sides of the equation by \(\sqrt{2}\) to find \(s\): \(s = \frac{12}{\sqrt{2}} = 6\sqrt{2}\).

Thus, the side length of the square is \(6\sqrt{2}\) inches.

Now, let's compare our calculated result with the given answer choices:
- A. \(\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}\)
- B. \(3\sqrt{2}\)
- C. \(6\sqrt{2}\)
- D. \(12\sqrt{2}\)

The calculated result matches option C.
