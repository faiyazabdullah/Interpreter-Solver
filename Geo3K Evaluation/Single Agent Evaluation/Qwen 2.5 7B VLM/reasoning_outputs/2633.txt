Let's analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \( m \angle 2 = 2x \)
   - \( m \angle 3 = x \)

2. **Understand the relationships:**
   - The figure appears to be a circle with various intersecting chords and diameters.
   - Angles \( \angle 2 \) and \( \angle 3 \) are related to the circle's properties.

3. **Apply relevant geometric theorems:**
   - The angle subtended by a chord at the circumference is half the angle subtended by the same chord at the center (Inscribed Angle Theorem).
   - Since \( \angle 2 \) and \( \angle 3 \) are part of the same circle, they might be related through the circle's symmetry or specific angle properties.

4. **Calculate \( x \):**
   - From the given information, we have \( m \angle 2 = 2x \) and \( m \angle 3 = x \).
   - Since these angles are related through the circle, let's assume they are supplementary or complementary in some way.
   - If we consider the circle's properties, the sum of angles around a point or on a straight line would help us find \( x \).

5. **Sum of angles:**
   - If we assume these angles are supplementary (summing up to 180 degrees):
     \[
     2x + x = 180^\circ
     \]
     \[
     3x = 180^\circ
     \]
     \[
     x = 60^\circ
     \]

6. **Verify the answer:**
   - If \( x = 60^\circ \), then \( m \angle 3 = 60^\circ \), which matches the answer choice C.
