To solve this problem, let's break down the information given and apply relevant geometric principles:

1. **Identify Given Information**:
   - Triangle XYZ has a centroid P.
   - KP = 3 (segment from centroid to one of the vertices).
   - XJ = 8 (length of a segment).

2. **Understand the Centroid Property**:
   - The centroid divides each median of a triangle into a ratio of 2:1. This means the segment from the centroid to the vertex is twice the length of the segment from the centroid to the midpoint of the opposite side.

3. **Apply the Median Property**:
   - Since XJ = 8 and XJ is a median, it means XJ is twice the length of PK.
   - Therefore, if PK = 3, then XJ = 2 * PK.

4. **Calculate YJ**:
   - Since XJ = 8 and it is a median, the length of YJ will be equal to XJ because YJ is also a median.
   - Hence, YJ = XJ = 8.

Given these calculations, we can conclude that YJ = 8.

<Solution>
Based on the analysis, the length of YJ is 8. Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 3
- B. 6
- C. 8
- D. 9

The closest and correct answer is C.
