Let's analyze the geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify Given Information:**
   - Angle at point D is \(45^\circ\).
   - Length of side \(DC\) is 5 units.
   - Point B is the intersection of the perpendicular from A to DC.

2. **Understand the Relationships:**
   - Since angle \(D = 45^\circ\) and AB is perpendicular to DC, triangle \(ABD\) is a right triangle with a \(45^\circ\) angle. This means it is a 45-45-90 triangle.
   - In a 45-45-90 triangle, the sides opposite the \(45^\circ\) angles are equal, and the hypotenuse is \( \sqrt{2} \) times the length of each leg.

3. **Calculate the Length of Leg \(x\):**
   - Let \(x\) be the length of \(AB\). Since \(AB\) is a leg of the 45-45-90 triangle and the hypotenuse \(DC\) is 5,
     \[
     x = \frac{5}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{5\sqrt{2}}{2}
     \]

4. **Identify \(y\):**
   - \(y\) represents the height of the triangle from \(A\) to \(DC\), which is the same as the length of \(AB\) because they form a right triangle with \(DC\) as the hypotenuse.

Therefore, the value of \(y\) is \( \frac{5\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

Solution Section:
Based on the analysis, the value of \(y\) is \( \frac{5\sqrt{2}}{2} \).
