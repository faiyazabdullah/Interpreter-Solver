First, let's analyze the geometric figure:

1. The figure shows a triangle XYZ with a point X directly above the midpoint Z of side WY.
2. The segment XZ is perpendicular to WY, meaning XZ is the altitude from X to WY.
3. The length XW is half the length of WY because X lies on the perpendicular bisector of WY.

Given:
- The length of XY = 12 units (hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by X, Y, and Z).

Since XZ is perpendicular to WY and X is the midpoint of WY, XW = XY / 2.

Thus:
- XW = 12 / 2 = 6 units.

Now, we can compare this with the answer choices:
- A. 6
- B. 12
- C. 18
- D. 24

The closest answer to our calculated value is A.

Final Answer: A
