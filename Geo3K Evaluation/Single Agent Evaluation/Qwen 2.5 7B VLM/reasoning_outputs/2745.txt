To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of side AB of parallelogram ABCD. We know the perimeter of the parallelogram and the expressions for the lengths of its sides.

Step 1: Identify the given information.
- The perimeter of parallelogram ABCD is 22.
- Side lengths: AB = 2y + 1, BC = x - w + 1, CD = 3x - 2, DA = 3 - 4w.

Step 2: Recall the property of a parallelogram.
In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. Therefore:
- AB = CD
- BC = DA

Step 3: Set up equations based on the perimeter.
The perimeter P of a parallelogram is the sum of all its sides:
\[ P = AB + BC + CD + DA \]

Substitute the given values:
\[ 22 = (2y + 1) + (x - w + 1) + (3x - 2) + (3 - 4w) \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 22 = (2y + 1 + x - w + 1 + 3x - 2 + 3 - 4w) \]
\[ 22 = 2y + x + 3x - w - 4w + 1 + 1 + 3 - 2 \]
\[ 22 = 2y + 4x - 5w + 3 \]

Step 4: Simplify the equation.
\[ 22 = 2y + 4x - 5w + 3 \]
\[ 22 - 3 = 2y + 4x - 5w \]
\[ 19 = 2y + 4x - 5w \]

Step 5: Solve for y, x, and w.
Since we don't have specific values for y, x, and w, let's assume they are integers that satisfy the equation. However, the problem asks for the length of AB, which is \(2y + 1\).

Given the perimeter and the relationship between the sides, we can test the provided answer choices to find the correct value of AB.

Test each option:
- If AB = 7:
\[ 2y + 1 = 7 \]
\[ 2y = 6 \]
\[ y = 3 \]

- If AB = 12:
\[ 2y + 1 = 12 \]
\[ 2y = 11 \]
\[ y = 5.5 \] (not an integer)

- If AB = 19:
\[ 2y + 1 = 19 \]
\[ 2y = 18 \]
\[ y = 9 \]

- If AB = 22:
\[ 2y + 1 = 22 \]
\[ 2y = 21 \]
\[ y = 10.5 \] (not an integer)

The only integer value that fits is y = 9, so AB = 19.
