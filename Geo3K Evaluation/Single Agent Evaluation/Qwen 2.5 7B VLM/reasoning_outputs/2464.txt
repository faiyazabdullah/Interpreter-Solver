Let's analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify Given Information:**
   - \( m \) is the perpendicular bisector of \( XZ \).
   - \( WZ = 14.9 \).

2. **Understand the Geometric Relationships:**
   - Since \( m \) is the perpendicular bisector of \( XZ \), it means that point \( Y \) (the midpoint of \( XZ \)) lies on line \( m \).
   - By the properties of a perpendicular bisector, any point on the bisector is equidistant from the endpoints of the segment it bisects.
   - Therefore, \( WY \) and \( ZY \) are equal, meaning \( WY = ZY \).

3. **Calculate \( WY \):**
   - Given \( WZ = 14.9 \), since \( Y \) is the midpoint of \( XZ \), \( WY = ZY \).
   - Therefore, \( WY = \frac{WZ}{2} = \frac{14.9}{2} = 7.45 \).

4. **Determine \( WX \):**
   - Since \( WY = ZY \) and both are part of triangle \( WYZ \), which forms a right triangle at \( Y \) due to the perpendicularity of \( m \) to \( XZ \).
   - Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \( WYZ \):
     \[
     WX^2 = WY^2 + ZY^2
     \]
     \[
     WX^2 = 7.45^2 + 7.45^2
     \]
     \[
     WX^2 = 55.5025 + 55.5025
     \]
     \[
     WX^2 = 111.005
     \]
     \[
     WX = \sqrt{111.005} \approx 10.54
     \]

5. **Compare with Given Choices:**
   - The calculated value of \( WX \) is approximately 10.54.
   - Comparing with the given choices: A. 7.45, B. 14.9, C. 22.4, D. 25.3.
   - The closest value is A. 7.45.
