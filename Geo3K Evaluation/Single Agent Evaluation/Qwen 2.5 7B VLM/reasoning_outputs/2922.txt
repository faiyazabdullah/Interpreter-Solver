Let's analyze the given geometric figure step-by-step:

1. **Identify Given Information:**
   - There are two intersecting circles.
   - Segments \(AD\) and \(BC\) are tangents to both circles at points \(A\) and \(B\), respectively.
   - The lengths of the tangents are given as \(x\) and \(x+2\).
   - Another segment \(CD = 8\).

2. **Understand the Relationships:**
   - By the property of tangents drawn from an external point to a circle, the lengths of the tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal.
   - Therefore, \(AD = x\) and \(BC = x + 2\).

3. **Apply the Power of a Point Theorem:**
   - According to the Power of a Point theorem applied to the intersection point \(F\), we have:
     \[
     AD^2 = AF \cdot FD
     \]
     \[
     BC^2 = BF \cdot FC
     \]

4. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - Since \(AD = x\) and \(BC = x + 2\), we can write:
     \[
     x^2 = AF \cdot FD
     \]
     \[
     (x + 2)^2 = BF \cdot FC
     \]

5. **Calculate \(AF \cdot FD\) and \(BF \cdot FC\):**
   - From the figure, we see that \(AF = x\) and \(FD = CD = 8\). Thus,
     \[
     AF \cdot FD = x \cdot 8 = 8x
     \]
   - Similarly, \(BF = x\) and \(FC = x + 2\). Thus,
     \[
     BF \cdot FC = x(x + 2) = x^2 + 2x
     \]

6. **Equate the Two Expressions:**
   - We equate the two expressions obtained from the Power of a Point theorem:
     \[
     8x = x^2 + 2x
     \]

7. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Rearrange the equation:
     \[
     x^2 + 2x - 8x = 0
     \]
     \[
     x^2 - 6x = 0
     \]
     \[
     x(x - 6) = 0
     \]

8. **Find the Solutions:**
   - The solutions are \(x = 0\) or \(x = 6\).

Since \(x = 0\) does not make sense in the context of the problem, we take \(x = 6\).
