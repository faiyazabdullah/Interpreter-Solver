<think>
First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric figure:

1. We have a triangle ABC where angle BAC = 60°.
2. Side BC is horizontal and labeled as x.
3. Side AB is the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by BC and AC, which measures \(16\sqrt{3}\).
4. Angle BAC is 60°, which means it is an angle in a 30-60-90 triangle relationship because the hypotenuse is \(16\sqrt{3}\).

In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. Here, the hypotenuse (AB) is \(16\sqrt{3}\), so the shorter leg (BC) would be half of this length divided by √3:
\[ BC = \frac{16\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} = 16 \]

Since BC is horizontal and forms the base of the triangle, we need to find the height (y) of the triangle from point A perpendicular to line BC.

In a 30-60-90 triangle, the height corresponding to the shorter leg is half the hypotenuse multiplied by √3. Thus,
\[ y = \frac{16}{2} \cdot \sqrt{3} = 8\sqrt{3} \]

Now, let's compare our calculated result with the given answer choices:
A. \(8\sqrt{2}\)
B. \(8\sqrt{3}\)
C. \(16\)
D. \(24\)

Our calculated value matches option B.
