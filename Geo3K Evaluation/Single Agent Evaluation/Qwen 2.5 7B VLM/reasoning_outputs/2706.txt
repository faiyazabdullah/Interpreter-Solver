To solve for \( x \), we need to analyze the given geometric figure and use the relationships between the segments and angles provided.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \( QH = 2x + 3 \)
   - \( HE = 6 - x \)
   - \( EI = 4y + 1 \)
   - \( IN = 2y \)

2. **Understand the relationships:**
   Since the figure appears to be a parallelogram (or a combination of parallel lines), we can use the properties of parallel lines and transversals. However, there is no direct indication of a parallelogram in the figure. Instead, we focus on the segments \( QH \) and \( HE \).

3. **Analyze the segments:**
   The segments \( QH \) and \( HE \) are part of a larger line segment \( QI \). Given the structure, it seems like these segments are part of a straight line, which means they sum up to a certain value along the line.

4. **Set up the equation:**
   Since \( QH \) and \( HE \) are consecutive parts of the same line segment \( QI \):
   \[
   QH + HE = QI
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   2x + 3 + 6 - x = QI
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   2x + 3 + 6 - x = QI
   \]
   \[
   x + 9 = QI
   \]

5. **Determine the length of \( QI \):**
   Since \( QI \) is the total length of the line segment \( QI \), and there is no further information about the exact length of \( QI \) other than the sum of the segments, we need to find a consistent value for \( x \) that fits the given options.

6. **Check the given answer choices:**
   - If \( x = 1 \):
     \[
     QI = 1 + 9 = 10
     \]
   - If \( x = 2 \):
     \[
     QI = 2 + 9 = 11
     \]
   - If \( x = 3 \):
     \[
     QI = 3 + 9 = 12
     \]
   - If \( x = 4 \):
     \[
     QI = 4 + 9 = 13
     \]

Since none of these values directly correspond to a specific option, we need to choose the closest one. The closest value to these sums is \( 11 \).
