QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the area of the given geometric figure, we need to break it down into simpler shapes whose areas we can calculate easily. The figure appears to be a combination of a rectangle and a triangle.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Shape Components:**
   - There is a rectangle with dimensions 5 m (length) and 6 m (width).
   - There is a right triangle with legs measuring 4 m and 4 m.

2. **Calculate the Area of the Rectangle:**
   \[
   \text{Area of the rectangle} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 5 \, \text{m} \times 6 \, \text{m} = 30 \, \text{m}^2
   \]

3. **Calculate the Area of the Triangle:**
   - The triangle has a base of 4 m and a height of 4 m.
   \[
   \text{Area of the triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \, \text{m} \times 4 \, \text{m} = 8 \, \text{m}^2
   \]

4. **Combine the Areas:**
   - The total area of the figure is the sum of the area of the rectangle and the area of the triangle.
   \[
   \text{Total area} = 30 \, \text{m}^2 + 8 \, \text{m}^2 = 38 \, \text{m}^2
   \]

5. **Compare with Given Choices:**
   - The calculated total area is 38 m².
   - The closest option to 38 m² among the given choices is D (30.0).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
