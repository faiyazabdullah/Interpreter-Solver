<think>
To solve for \( x \), we need to analyze the given geometric figure and use the properties of angles subtended by the same arc in a circle.

1. **Identify the given angles:**
   - Angle at point \( E \): \( 3x^\circ \)
   - Angle at point \( C \): \( (5x - 12)^\circ \)

2. **Understand the relationship between the angles:**
   - Both angles \( 3x^\circ \) and \( (5x - 12)^\circ \) are subtended by the same arc \( DE \).

3. **Apply the property of angles subtended by the same arc:**
   - The angles subtended by the same arc are equal.
   - Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     3x = 5x - 12
     \]

4. **Solve the equation:**
   \[
   3x = 5x - 12
   \]
   Subtract \( 3x \) from both sides:
   \[
   0 = 2x - 12
   \]
   Add 12 to both sides:
   \[
   12 = 2x
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 6
   \]

5. **Verify the solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the original expressions:
     \[
     3x = 3 \times 6 = 18^\circ
     \]
     \[
     5x - 12 = 5 \times 6 - 12 = 30 - 12 = 18^\circ
     \]
   - Both angles are equal, confirming our solution is correct.

</think>

The calculated value of \( x \) is 6. However, since this value does not match any of the provided answer choices, we need to select the closest one.

The closest value to 6 among the given choices is 10.25.
