To solve for the measure of \( m \angle 1 \), we need to use the properties of circles and tangents. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the given information and relationships:**
   - There is a circle with center \( E \).
   - Segments \( BC \) and \( BD \) appear to be tangent to the circle at points \( D \) and \( F \) respectively.
   - The angle \( \angle BDE \) is given as \( 102^\circ \).

2. **Understand the properties:**
   - Since \( BC \) and \( BD \) are tangent to the circle, the point of tangency creates right angles with the radii at those points. Therefore, \( \angle BDF = 90^\circ \) and \( \angle BDC = 90^\circ \).

3. **Analyze the triangle \( \triangle BDE \):**
   - The sum of angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \).
   - Therefore, \( \angle BED + \angle BDE + \angle BFE = 180^\circ \).

4. **Calculate \( \angle BED \):**
   - We know \( \angle BDE = 102^\circ \).
   - Since \( \angle BDF = 90^\circ \), \( \angle BFE = 90^\circ \).
   - Thus, \( \angle BED = 180^\circ - 102^\circ - 90^\circ = 88^\circ \).

5. **Determine \( \angle 1 \):**
   - \( \angle 1 \) is the exterior angle of \( \triangle BDE \) formed by extending \( BD \) to \( C \).
   - The exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles.
   - Therefore, \( \angle 1 = \angle BDE + \angle BFE = 102^\circ + 90^\circ = 192^\circ - 180^\circ = 102^\circ \).

However, upon re-evaluating the problem, it seems there might be a misinterpretation or a simpler approach:
- The angle \( \angle 1 \) could be the supplementary angle of the given \( 102^\circ \) angle, which would be \( 180^\circ - 102^\circ = 78^\circ \).

Given the options, the closest and most logical answer is:
