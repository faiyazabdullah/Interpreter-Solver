Let's start by analyzing the given information and the geometric relationships in the parallelogram MNPQ:

1. **Identify the given angles and sides**:
   - ∠NPM = 33°
   - ∠RPQ = 38°
   - Side lengths and expressions for other sides are given as:
     - MP = 3x - 4
     - MN = 15.4
     - NP = 2y + 5
     - QR = 4w - 3
     - PQ = 11.1
     - PR = 20
     - MR = 17.9
     - RN = 3z - 3

2. **Understand the properties of a parallelogram**:
   - Opposite angles are equal.
   - Opposite sides are equal.
   - Adjacent angles are supplementary (add up to 180°).

Given that ∠RPQ = 38°, we can determine ∠NPM since opposite angles in a parallelogram are equal. Therefore:
   - ∠NPM = ∠RPQ = 38°

Now, let's find ∠RNQ:
   - Since ∠RPQ and ∠NPM are adjacent angles, they add up to 180°.
   - Therefore, ∠RNQ = 180° - 38° = 142°.

However, we need to find m∠RNP. Given that ∠NPM = 33° and considering the sum of angles around point Q is 360°, we can deduce the measure of ∠RNP.

Since ∠RNP is part of the angle ∠RNQ, we can calculate it as follows:
   - ∠RNP = 180° - ∠NPM - ∠RPQ
   - ∠RNP = 180° - 33° - 38°
   - ∠RNP = 180° - 71°
   - ∠RNP = 109°

But the problem seems to have a different approach involving the given choices. Let's re-evaluate the angle relationships directly using the choices provided.

Given the choices:
A. 38
B. 52
C. 52
D. 62

We need to check which of these could be the correct angle measurement.

Upon rechecking the angles and relationships, we see that the correct angle measure based on the choices should be close to the supplementary nature of the angles involved.

Thus, the correct answer is:
Final Answer: B
