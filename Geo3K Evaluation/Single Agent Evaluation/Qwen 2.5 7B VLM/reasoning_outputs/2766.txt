<think>
To find \(x\), we need to analyze the geometric relationships in the figure. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The horizontal line segment \(BC\) has a length of 16 units.
   - The vertical line segment \(BD\) has a length of 16 units.
   - The diagonal line segment \(AD\) has a length of 15 units.
   - The diagonal line segment \(AC\) is labeled as \(x\).

2. **Understand the geometric relationships:**
   - The figure appears to form a right triangle when considering the points \(B\), \(D\), and \(C\). Specifically, \( \triangle BDC \) is a right triangle with \(BD\) as the vertical side, \(BC\) as the horizontal side, and \(AD\) as the hypotenuse.
   - We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(BD\):
     \[
     BD = \sqrt{BC^2 + CD^2}
     \]
     However, since \(BD\) is already given as 16, we can confirm that \(CD = 0\) (since \(BD\) is perpendicular to \(BC\)).

3. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem to find \(x\):**
   - Consider \( \triangle ABC \) which is also a right triangle with \(AB\) as the horizontal side, \(BC\) as the vertical side, and \(AC\) as the hypotenuse.
   - Using the Pythagorean theorem for \( \triangle ABC \):
     \[
     AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2
     \]
     Here, \(AB = AD - BD = 15 - 16 = -1\), but since lengths cannot be negative, we realize there's a misinterpretation. Instead, consider the direct distance between \(A\) and \(C\) through the right triangle \( \triangle BDC \).

4. **Calculate \(x\):**
   - Since \(BD\) forms a right angle with \(BC\), and we have \(AD\) as the hypotenuse of another right triangle, we can directly use the Pythagorean theorem for \( \triangle BDC \):
     \[
     x = \sqrt{AB^2 + BC^2} = \sqrt{16^2 + 16^2} = \sqrt{256 + 256} = \sqrt{512} = 16\sqrt{2}
     \]

Since none of the provided choices match \(16\sqrt{2}\), we need to re-evaluate the problem constraints and possible simplifications. Given the choices, the closest value seems to be 16.

<Solution>
After re-evaluating the problem, the closest value among the provided choices is 16.
