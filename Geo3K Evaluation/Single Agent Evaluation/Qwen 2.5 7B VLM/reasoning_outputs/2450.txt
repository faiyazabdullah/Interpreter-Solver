<thought>
First, let's summarize the given information:
- The total trip distance is 3482 miles.
- The distances between the cities are expressed as algebraic expressions:
  - From Des Moines (C) to Phoenix (B): \(110x + 53\) miles.
  - From Phoenix (B) to Atlanta (A): \(150x + 91\) miles.
  - From Atlanta (A) back to Des Moines (C): \(73.8x\) miles.

We need to find the distance between Phoenix and Atlanta, which corresponds to the expression \(150x + 91\).

Since the total trip distance is the sum of these three segments:
\[ (110x + 53) + (150x + 91) + (73.8x) = 3482 \]

Let's combine the like terms:
\[ 110x + 150x + 73.8x + 53 + 91 = 3482 \]
\[ (110 + 150 + 73.8)x + 144 = 3482 \]
\[ 333.8x + 144 = 3482 \]

Next, isolate the variable \(x\):
\[ 333.8x = 3482 - 144 \]
\[ 333.8x = 3338 \]
\[ x = \frac{3338}{333.8} \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Now, substitute \(x = 10\) into the expression for the distance from Phoenix to Atlanta:
\[ 150x + 91 = 150(10) + 91 = 1500 + 91 = 1591 \]

The distance from Phoenix to Atlanta is 1591 miles.

The distance from Phoenix to Atlanta is 1591 miles.
