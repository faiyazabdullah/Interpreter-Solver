First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric relationships in the figure:

1. We are given that \( m \angle 2 = 2x \) and \( m \angle 3 = x \).
2. We need to find \( m \angle 2 \).

From the diagram, we can see that angles \( \angle 2 \) and \( \angle 3 \) are supplementary angles because they form a straight line at point \( B \). Therefore, their sum is 180 degrees:
\[ m \angle 2 + m \angle 3 = 180^\circ \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ 2x + x = 180^\circ \]
\[ 3x = 180^\circ \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{180^\circ}{3} = 60^\circ \]

Since \( m \angle 2 = 2x \):
\[ m \angle 2 = 2 \times 60^\circ = 120^\circ \]

However, none of the provided answer choices match 120 degrees. Let's re-evaluate the problem statement and the given choices:
- The choices provided are A (30), B (45), C (60), and D (90).

Given our calculation, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or error in the problem setup or choices provided. But based on the closest match, the closest option to 120 degrees is C (60).
