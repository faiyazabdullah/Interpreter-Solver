<think>
First, let's analyze the given kite FGHIJ:

1. We know that FGHIJ is a kite.
2. The angles at F and H are given as 72° and 128° respectively.
3. In a kite, the non-vertex angles (the angles opposite each other) are equal.
4. Therefore, the angle at J must be the same as the angle at I.
5. The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is always 360°.

Now, let's calculate the unknown angle:

- Sum of known angles at F and H = 72° + 128° = 200°.
- Remaining angles at G and J (or I) = 360° - 200° = 160°.
- Since G and J (or I) are supplementary angles in the kite, they are equal.

Thus, the measure of angle GJ (or IG) is 160°/2 = 80°.

<solution>
Given the angles and the properties of a kite, we can conclude that the measure of angle GJ (or IG) is 80°.
