Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the given lengths:**
   - RS = 6
   - VT = 3

2. **Analyze the relationship between RX and VX:**
   - RX is twice the length of VX. Therefore, if VX = x, then RX = 2x.

3. **Understand the configuration:**
   - The figure appears to be a quadrilateral (RSVT) with some segments intersecting at point X.
   - We need to find XY.

4. **Calculate VX:**
   - Since RX = 2x and RS = 6, we can infer that VX + RX = RS.
   - Let VX = x, then RX = 2x.
   - So, x + 2x = 6, which simplifies to 3x = 6.
   - Solving for x gives x = 2.

5. **Determine VX:**
   - VX = 2.

6. **Find XY:**
   - XY = VX + YX.
   - Since VX = 2 and YX is unknown, we need to use the given lengths and relationships to find YX.
   - Given the lengths and relationships, it seems that XY = VX + YX, and since VX = 2 and YX is part of the overall length, we can assume XY = 3.

Based on the analysis, XY = 3.
