To solve for \(\sin A\), we need to use the definition of sine in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case:

- The length of the opposite side to angle \(A\) is \(b = 48\).
- The length of the hypotenuse is \(c = 50\).

So, we can calculate \(\sin A\) as follows:
\[
\sin A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{48}{50}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction:
\[
\sin A = \frac{48}{50} = 0.96
\]

However, since none of the provided answer choices match 0.96, we need to check the closest value among the given choices. The closest value to 0.96 is 0.9, which is not listed. But we should still choose the closest option from the given choices.

Let's review the provided choices:
A. 0.14
B. 0.28
C. 0.48
D. 0.5

The closest value to 0.96 among these choices is 0.5.
