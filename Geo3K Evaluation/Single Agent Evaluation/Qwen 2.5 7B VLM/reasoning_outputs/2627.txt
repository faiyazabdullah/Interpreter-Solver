<think>
Let's analyze the image step by step:

1. **Identify the given information**: The image shows a circle with points R, B, S, and T marked on it. There are two angles labeled as \(x^\circ\) at point B and \(2x^\circ\) at point T. The center of the circle is point B.

2. **Understand the relationship between the angles**:
   - Since B is the center of the circle, the angle subtended by arc RS at the center (angle RBST) is twice the angle subtended by the same arc at any point on the circumference. Therefore, angle RBST = \(2x^\circ\).

3. **Sum of angles in triangle RBST**:
   - Triangle RBST is an isosceles triangle because BR = BS and BT = BS (radii of the circle).
   - The sum of angles in any triangle is \(180^\circ\).

4. **Calculate the third angle**:
   - Let the third angle be \(y^\circ\). Then we have:
     \[
     x + 2x + y = 180^\circ
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     3x + y = 180^\circ
     \]

5. **Determine the value of y**:
   - Since y is the remaining angle in the triangle, we can express y as:
     \[
     y = 180^\circ - 3x
     \]

6. **Analyze the given choices**:
   - We need to find a value for x such that when substituted into the equation \(3x + y = 180^\circ\), we get a valid angle measure.

7. **Check the answer choices**:
   - If \(x = 30^\circ\):
     \[
     y = 180^\circ - 3(30^\circ) = 180^\circ - 90^\circ = 90^\circ
     \]
     This does not make sense as y should be less than 180^\circ.

   - If \(x = 40^\circ\):
     \[
     y = 180^\circ - 3(40^\circ) = 180^\circ - 120^\circ = 60^\circ
     \]
     This fits well as both x and y are valid angles.

   - If \(x = 50^\circ\):
     \[
     y = 180^\circ - 3(50^\circ) = 180^\circ - 150^\circ = 30^\circ
     \]
     This also fits but is less likely due to the symmetry.

   - If \(x = 60^\circ\):
     \[
     y = 180^\circ - 3(60^\circ) = 180^\circ - 180^\circ = 0^\circ
     \]
     This is not possible as y cannot be zero.

Based on the analysis, the most logical and symmetric choice is \(x = 40^\circ\).

</think>

Solution:
After evaluating the options, the correct value for \(x\) that satisfies the conditions of the problem is \(40^\circ\).
