Let's analyze the geometric figure:

1. The figure shows a circle with a shaded region.
2. The angle at point K is marked as 180°.
3. There are perpendicular lines drawn from points J and L to the horizontal line passing through K.
4. The vertical distance between these lines is labeled as \(x\) cm.
5. The area of the shaded region is given as 66 cm².

Given that the angle at K is 180°, it indicates that JK and KL form a straight line segment. This means the shaded region is half of the circle's area.

The formula for the area of a circle is \(A = \pi r^2\), where \(r\) is the radius. Since the shaded region is half of the circle, we can write:
\[ \text{Area of the shaded region} = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 \]

We know the area of the shaded region is 66 cm², so:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 = 66 \]

Solving for \(r^2\):
\[ \pi r^2 = 132 \]
\[ r^2 = \frac{132}{\pi} \approx \frac{132}{3.14} \approx 42.04 \]
\[ r \approx \sqrt{42.04} \approx 6.48 \]

Since \(x\) represents the diameter (twice the radius) of the circle:
\[ x = 2r \approx 2 \times 6.48 \approx 12.96 \]

Comparing this with the given answer choices:
A. 4.6
B. 6.5
C. 13.0
D. 26.0

The closest value is 13.0.
