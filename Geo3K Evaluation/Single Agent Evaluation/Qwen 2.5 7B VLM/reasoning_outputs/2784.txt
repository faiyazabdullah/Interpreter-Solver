To solve for \(x\), we need to use the properties of tangents and circles. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Identify the Tangents**: The segments that appear to be tangent to the circle are labeled as \(CE\) and \(DE\). By the property of tangents drawn from an external point to a circle, they are equal in length.

2. **Given Information**:
   - \(CE = 6\)
   - \(DE = 9\)

3. **Apply the Tangent-Secant Theorem**: According to the tangent-tangent theorem, the lengths of the two tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal. Therefore, since \(CE\) and \(DE\) are tangents from the same external point \(D\), they must be equal in length. However, the problem states that \(DE = 9\) and \(CE = 6\), which means there might be a misunderstanding or mislabeling. For the purpose of this problem, let's assume the correct interpretation is that these segments are indeed tangents and the lengths are as given.

4. **Calculate \(x\)**: Since the problem asks to find \(x\), and there's no direct connection between \(x\) and the tangents \(CE\) and \(DE\), it suggests that \(x\) could be a variable related to the circle's properties or another part of the figure. Given the choices and the fact that the tangents' lengths are 6 and 9, the most logical value for \(x\) would be the sum or difference of these lengths, but typically in such problems, the tangents' lengths are used directly if no further context is provided.

Given the choices, the closest value to the lengths of the tangents is 9, which matches choice B.

Solution:
Since the lengths of the tangents are 6 and 9, and considering the choices provided, the closest value to these lengths is 9. Therefore, the correct answer is:
