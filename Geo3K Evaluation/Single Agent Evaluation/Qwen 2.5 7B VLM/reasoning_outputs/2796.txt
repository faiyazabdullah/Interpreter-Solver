First, let's analyze the given geometric figure:

1. We have a circle with center \( B \).
2. Points \( X \) and \( Y \) lie on the circle.
3. There is an angle \( \angle BYX \) marked as \( 49^\circ \).
4. The arc \( \widehat{YX} \) spans from point \( Y \) to point \( X \).
5. We need to find the measure of the inscribed angle \( \angle YZX \), which subtends the same arc \( \widehat{YX} \).

According to the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts. Therefore, the measure of the arc \( \widehat{YX} \) can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Measure of arc } \widehat{YX} = 2 \times \text{Measure of } \angle BYX = 2 \times 49^\circ = 98^\circ \]

Now, we need to find the measure of the inscribed angle \( \angle YZX \). Since \( \angle YZX \) subtends the arc \( \widehat{YX} \):

\[ \text{Measure of } \angle YZX = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Measure of arc } \widehat{YX} = \frac{1}{2} \times 98^\circ = 49^\circ \]

However, the problem asks for the measure of the central angle \( \angle YZX \), which is the supplement of the inscribed angle \( \angle YZX \):

\[ \text{Measure of } \angle YZX = 180^\circ - 49^\circ = 131^\circ \]

But since we need the measure of the arc \( \widehat{YX} \) subtended by \( \angle YZX \), we need to consider the full circle minus the given angle at the center:

\[ \text{Measure of } \angle YZX = 360^\circ - (96^\circ + 131^\circ) = 133^\circ \]

Thus, the measure of the arc \( \widehat{YX} \) is \( 98^\circ \), but the supplementary angle to find the arc \( \widehat{YX} \) is:

\[ 180^\circ - 49^\circ = 131^\circ \]

Finally, considering the supplementary angle for the arc:

\[ 180^\circ - 49^\circ = 131^\circ \]

This value does not directly match any of the answer choices, so we need to re-evaluate the problem. Given the options, the closest value would be:
