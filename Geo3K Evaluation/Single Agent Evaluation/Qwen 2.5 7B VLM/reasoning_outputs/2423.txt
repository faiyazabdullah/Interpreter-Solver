<think>
To solve this problem, we need to use the fact that triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is an isosceles triangle with \( AB \cong BC \). This means the lengths of \( AB \) and \( BC \) are equal.

Given:
- \( AB = 2x - 7 \)
- \( BC = 4x - 21 \)

Since \( AB = BC \), we can set up the equation:
\[ 2x - 7 = 4x - 21 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):
1. Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:
\[ -7 = 2x - 21 \]
2. Add 21 to both sides:
\[ 14 = 2x \]
3. Divide by 2:
\[ x = 7 \]

Now that we have \( x = 7 \), we can find the length of \( AB \) (or \( BC \)) by substituting \( x \) back into either expression for the side lengths:

For \( AB \):
\[ AB = 2x - 7 = 2(7) - 7 = 14 - 7 = 7 \]

Thus, the length of \( AB \) is 7.

Finally, comparing our calculated result with the given answer choices, we see that:
- A. 3
- B. 4
- C. 7
- D. 11

The closest answer to our calculation is C.

Final Answer: C</think>
