To find XY in the isosceles triangle XYZ, we need to use the fact that the sides opposite the equal angles in an isosceles triangle are equal. From the diagram, we see that angle X = angle Z because they are marked with the same small arc. Therefore, the lengths of sides opposite these equal angles should be equal. 

Given:
- Side XY = 2x + 3
- Side YZ = 4x - 1

Since XY = YZ (because ∠X = ∠Z), we can set up the equation:
\[2x + 3 = 4x - 1\]

Now, let's solve for x:
\[2x + 3 = 4x - 1\]
Subtract 2x from both sides:
\[3 = 2x - 1\]
Add 1 to both sides:
\[4 = 2x\]
Divide by 2:
\[x = 2\]

Now, substitute x = 2 back into the expression for XY:
\[XY = 2x + 3 = 2(2) + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7\]

Thus, the length of XY is 7.
