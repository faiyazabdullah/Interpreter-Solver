Let's analyze the given geometric figure and the information provided:

1. The circle \(\odot M\) has points \(F\), \(L\), \(H\), \(J\), \(P\), and \(N\) marked.
2. \(FL = 24\) and \(HJ = 48\) are given lengths of chords in the circle.
3. The measure of arc \(\widehat{HP} = 65^\circ\) is also provided.

We need to find the length of segment \(NJ\).

Given the information, it seems we are dealing with a circle and some chords. However, there is no direct relationship between the lengths of the chords and the arc \(\widehat{HP}\) given in the problem statement. Typically, chord lengths are not directly related to arc measures without additional information like the radius or the central angle subtended by the arc.

Since the problem does not provide enough information to calculate \(NJ\) directly from the given data, we can only consider the provided options. 

Let's evaluate the options:

A. 24
B. 32
C. 48
D. 65

Since the problem does not provide sufficient data to determine the exact length of \(NJ\), and considering the options available, the closest value to the given lengths might be a reasonable assumption. However, none of these values can be derived directly from the given information.

Given the lack of sufficient information to compute \(NJ\) precisely, and the need to select one of the provided options, the closest value would be:
