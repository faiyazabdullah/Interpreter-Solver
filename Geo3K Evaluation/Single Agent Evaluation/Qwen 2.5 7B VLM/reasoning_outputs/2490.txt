To determine the value of \(x\) that makes the quadrilateral a parallelogram, we need to use the properties of parallelograms. Specifically, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel, and opposite angles are equal.

From the image:
- The lengths of the sides are labeled as \(x+4\), \(3x-6\).
- The angles are labeled as \(55^\circ\), \(60^\circ\), and \(5y^\circ\).

Since it's a parallelogram, the opposite sides must be equal:
\[ x + 4 = 3x - 6 \]

Let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Start with the equation:
   \[ x + 4 = 3x - 6 \]

2. Subtract \(x\) from both sides to isolate the variable terms on one side:
   \[ 4 = 2x - 6 \]

3. Add 6 to both sides to further isolate the term involving \(x\):
   \[ 10 = 2x \]

4. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \(x\):
   \[ x = 5 \]

Thus, the value of \(x\) that makes the quadrilateral a parallelogram is \(5\).

Now, let's compare this result with the given answer choices:
A. 3
B. 5
C. 12
D. 18

The closest match to our calculated value is B. 5.

Final Answer: B</think>

<Solution>
To determine the value of \(x\) that makes the quadrilateral a parallelogram, we use the property that opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal. From the image, we have:
\[ x + 4 = 3x - 6 \]

Solving this equation:
\[ x + 4 = 3x - 6 \]
\[ 4 + 6 = 3x - x \]
\[ 10 = 2x \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Comparing this with the answer choices, the closest match is B. 5.
