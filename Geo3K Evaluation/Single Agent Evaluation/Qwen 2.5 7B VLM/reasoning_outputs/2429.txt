To find the area of the parallelogram, we need to use the formula for the area of a parallelogram, which is base times height.

1. **Identify the base and height**:
   - The base of the parallelogram is given as \( AD = 7 \) mm.
   - To find the height, we can use the right triangle formed by dropping a perpendicular from point \( C \) to line \( AD \). The angle between the perpendicular and line \( AD \) is \( 60^\circ \).

2. **Calculate the height**:
   - The height \( h \) can be found using trigonometry. Since the angle between the perpendicular and \( AD \) is \( 60^\circ \), the height \( h \) is the adjacent side of the \( 30^\circ-60^\circ-90^\circ \) triangle.
   - In a \( 30^\circ-60^\circ-90^\circ \) triangle, the ratio of the sides opposite to these angles is \( 1 : \sqrt{3} : 2 \).
   - Therefore, if the hypotenuse (which is the length \( BC \)) is \( 14 \) mm, the height \( h \) (opposite to the \( 60^\circ \) angle) will be:
     \[
     h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times BC = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 14 = 7\sqrt{3}
     \]

3. **Calculate the area**:
   - The area \( A \) of the parallelogram is:
     \[
     A = \text{base} \times \text{height} = 7 \times 7\sqrt{3} = 49\sqrt{3}
     \]
   - Approximating \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \):
     \[
     A \approx 49 \times 1.732 = 84.968
     \]

4. **Compare with answer choices**:
   - The closest value to 84.968 is 85.0, which corresponds to option B.

<solution>
The area of the parallelogram is approximately \( 85.0 \) mmÂ². Rounding to the nearest tenth, the closest answer choice is:
