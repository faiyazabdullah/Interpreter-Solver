Let's analyze the geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the given information**: We have a circle with center \( G \) and a line segment \( JK \) that appears to be tangent to the circle at point \( K \). The length of \( JK \) is given as 4, and the distance between the points \( K \) and \( J \) along the circle is 6.

2. **Understand the relationship**: Since \( JK \) is tangent to the circle at \( K \), the radius \( GK \) is perpendicular to \( JK \). This means \( \angle GKB = 90^\circ \).

3. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem**: In right triangle \( GKB \), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \( GB \).
   \[
   GB^2 = GK^2 + KB^2
   \]
   Here, \( KB = JK = 4 \) because \( JK \) is tangent at \( K \), making \( KB \) the vertical leg of the right triangle.

4. **Calculate \( GK \)**: The length \( GK \) is the radius of the circle. We know the length of \( KB \) is 4. Using the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   GB^2 = 4^2 + x^2
   \]

5. **Use the given distance**: The distance \( GK \) can also be found using the length of the chord \( JK \) and the perpendicular distance from the center to the chord. However, since the problem states that \( JK \) is tangent at \( K \), we directly use the tangent property.

6. **Revisit the calculation**: The length of the tangent \( JK \) is given as 4, and the segment \( JK \) forms a right triangle with the radius. Therefore, the correct length for the radius \( GK \) is derived from the tangent property and the given length of \( JK \).

Given the options, the closest value to our calculated radius \( GK \) is 4.

Solution:
Since the length of \( JK \) is 4, which matches the given answer choice \( B \), the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
