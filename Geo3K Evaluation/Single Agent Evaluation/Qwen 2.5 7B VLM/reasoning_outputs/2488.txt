<think>
First, let's analyze the given geometric figure. We have a rectangle labeled ABWFW', where W' is the point we need to determine the distance from W to.

We know the following:
- The distance between W and W' is 8 units.
- The total length from F to W is 12 units.

To find the scale factor from W to W', we need to compare the distances directly:

1. Distance from W to W': 8 units
2. Total distance from F to W: 12 units

The scale factor can be determined by dividing the distance from W to W' by the total distance from F to W:
\[ \text{Scale Factor} = \frac{\text{Distance from W to W'}}{\text{Total Distance from F to W}} = \frac{8}{12} = \frac{2}{3} \]

Thus, the scale factor from W to W' is \(\frac{2}{3}\).

Now, comparing our calculated scale factor with the given answer choices:
A. \(\frac{1}{3}\)
B. \(\frac{2}{3}\)
C. \(\frac{3}{4}\)
D. \(\frac{3}{2}\)

The closest match to our calculated scale factor is \(\frac{2}{3}\).

Final Answer: B</think>

<solution>
\[
\boxed{B}
