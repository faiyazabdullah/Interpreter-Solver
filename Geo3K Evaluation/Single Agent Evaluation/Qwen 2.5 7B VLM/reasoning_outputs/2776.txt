Let's analyze the given information and the geometric relationships in the rectangle ABCD:

1. We know that quadrilateral ABCD is a rectangle.
2. Angle 2 measures 40 degrees.
3. We need to find the measure of angle 8.

In a rectangle, opposite angles are equal and adjacent angles add up to 180 degrees. 

Since ABCD is a rectangle:
- Angles A and C are right angles (90 degrees).
- Angles B and D are also right angles (90 degrees).

Given that angle 2 measures 40 degrees, we can determine the measure of angle 8 because they are opposite angles in the rectangle. Therefore, angle 8 will have the same measure as angle 2.

Thus, angle 8 also measures 40 degrees.

<solution>
Based on the analysis, the measure of angle 8 is 40 degrees.

Final Answer: A
