Let's analyze the given information and the geometric relationships in the image:

1. Quadrilateral \(EFGH\) is a rectangle.
2. The angle \(\angle HGE\) is given as \(13^\circ\).
3. We need to find the measure of \(\angle FGE\).

Since \(EFGH\) is a rectangle, the following properties hold:
- All angles in a rectangle are right angles (\(90^\circ\)).
- Opposite sides are equal and parallel.
- Diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other.

Given \(\angle HGE = 13^\circ\), we can determine \(\angle HEG\) because \(\angle HEG\) and \(\angle HGE\) are adjacent angles forming a straight line at point \(E\). Therefore:
\[ \angle HEG + \angle HGE = 180^\circ \]
\[ \angle HEG = 180^\circ - 13^\circ = 167^\circ \]

However, since \(EFGH\) is a rectangle, \(\angle HEG\) cannot be \(167^\circ\) because it would not fit within the properties of a rectangle. Instead, we need to consider the complementary relationship in the triangle formed by points \(E\), \(G\), and the intersection of the diagonals at point \(K\).

In triangle \(EGF\):
- \(\angle EGF = 90^\circ\) (since \(EFGH\) is a rectangle).
- \(\angle FGE = 90^\circ - \angle HGE\).

Thus:
\[ \angle FGE = 90^\circ - 13^\circ = 77^\circ \]

So, the measure of \(\angle FGE\) is \(77^\circ\).

<solution>
Based on the analysis, the measure of \(\angle FGE\) is \(77^\circ\).
