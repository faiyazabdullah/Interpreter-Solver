Let's analyze the given geometric figure:

1. The figure appears to be a quadrilateral with points A, B, C, and D.
2. There is a right angle at point A (angle A is marked with a square).
3. There is another right angle at point D (angle D is also marked with a square).
4. The length of side AB is 12 units.
5. The length of side BC is \(t + 1\) units.
6. The length of side AC is 24 units.

We need to find the value of the variable \(t\).

To solve this problem, we can use the Pythagorean theorem for the right triangle ABD:
- In triangle ABD, AB = 12 and AD = unknown.
- Since angle A is a right angle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem: \(AB^2 + AD^2 = AC^2\).

However, we notice that there is no direct way to apply the Pythagorean theorem here without knowing AD. Instead, let's consider the relationship between sides AB and BC, which are perpendicular to each other. Since AD is vertical and BD is horizontal, we can infer that triangle ABD forms a right triangle.

Given that AD is part of the right triangle ABD, and considering the lengths of the sides, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the legs of a right triangle equals the square of the hypotenuse. Here, AB and BD are the legs, and AC is the hypotenuse. We can set up the equation:
\[ AB^2 + BD^2 = AC^2 \]
\[ 12^2 + BD^2 = 24^2 \]
\[ 144 + BD^2 = 576 \]
\[ BD^2 = 576 - 144 \]
\[ BD^2 = 432 \]
\[ BD = \sqrt{432} \]

Now, we need to find the value of \(t\) using the length of BD and the fact that BD + AD = BC. Since BD = \(\sqrt{432}\), and AD is the remaining part of the triangle, we can solve for \(t\):
\[ t + 1 = BD \]
\[ t + 1 = \sqrt{432} \]

Since \(\sqrt{432} \approx 20.78\), we can approximate \(t\) as:
\[ t \approx 20.78 - 1 = 19.78 \]

However, we need to check the closest integer value from the given choices. The closest integer to 19.78 is 20, but since the choices are limited to integers, we need to re-evaluate the problem constraints.

Upon re-evaluation, it seems the correct approach is to recognize that the problem might have a simpler geometric relationship involving the Pythagorean theorem directly applied to the given lengths.

Given the lengths:
\[ AB = 12 \]
\[ AC = 24 \]
\[ BC = t + 1 \]

Using the Pythagorean theorem again:
\[ AB^2 + AD^2 = AC^2 \]
\[ 12^2 + AD^2 = 24^2 \]
\[ 144 + AD^2 = 576 \]
\[ AD^2 = 576 - 144 \]
\[ AD^2 = 432 \]
\[ AD = \sqrt{432} \]

Since \(AD\) is part of the right triangle and the total length is given as \(t + 1\), we can infer:
\[ t + 1 = \sqrt{432} \approx 20.78 \]

Thus, the closest integer value is 20, but the closest choice from the given options is:
\[ t = 5 \]
