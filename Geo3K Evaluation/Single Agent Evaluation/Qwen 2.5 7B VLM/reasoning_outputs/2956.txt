<think>
Let's analyze the given geometric figure:

1. We have a quadrilateral ABCD with diagonals AC and BD intersecting at point E.
2. Triangle ABE is a right triangle because angle ABE is marked as a right angle (90 degrees).
3. Triangle CDE is also a right triangle because angle CDE is marked as a right angle (90 degrees).
4. The lengths of sides AB and CD are given as 5 and 10 respectively.
5. The length of diagonal BD is given as 8.
6. We need to find the length of side AB.

Since triangle ABE is a right triangle and triangle CDE is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of AB.

In triangle ABE:
\[ AB^2 + BE^2 = AE^2 \]

In triangle CDE:
\[ CD^2 + DE^2 = CE^2 \]

However, we do not have enough information about the segments BE and DE directly. Instead, we can use the fact that triangles ABE and CDE share some properties due to their right angles and the fact that they are part of the same quadrilateral.

Since AB = 5 and CD = 10, and considering the properties of the quadrilateral, it appears that AB might be half the length of CD. Therefore, let's calculate:

\[ AB = \frac{CD}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Thus, AB = 5.

<Solution>
Based on the analysis, the length of AB is 5.
