To solve this problem, let's break down the information and analyze the geometric properties:

1. **Identify the Given Information:**
   - We have a rhombus \(ABCD\).
   - Side length \(AB = 2x + 3\).
   - Side length \(BC = 5x\).

2. **Understand the Properties of a Rhombus:**
   - All sides of a rhombus are equal.
   - The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles (90 degrees).

3. **Analyze the Angles:**
   - Since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, all four sides are equal.
   - Therefore, we can set the side lengths equal to each other:
     \[
     2x + 3 = 5x
     \]
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     2x + 3 = 5x
     \]
     \[
     3 = 3x
     \]
     \[
     x = 1
     \]

4. **Calculate the Side Lengths:**
   - Substitute \(x = 1\) into the expressions for the side lengths:
     \[
     AB = 2(1) + 3 = 5
     \]
     \[
     BC = 5(1) = 5
     \]

5. **Determine the Angle:**
   - Since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, all angles are either 60 degrees or 120 degrees. The diagonals bisect these angles.
   - If we draw the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\), they will intersect at point \(E\), and these diagonals will bisect the angles of the rhombus.
   - The angle bisected by the diagonals will be half of 60 degrees (since the diagonals of a rhombus split the angles into two 30-degree angles).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The angle \(\angle AEB\) is formed by the intersection of the diagonals and bisects the angle of 60 degrees.
   - Therefore, \(\angle AEB = 60^\circ\).

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:
