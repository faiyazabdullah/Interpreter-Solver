Let's analyze the image step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Shape**: The figure appears to be a triangle with one side labeled as \(x\) and another side labeled as 24. There is a right angle indicated between the sides labeled 24 and the hypotenuse labeled 74.

2. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**: Since the triangle has a right angle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find \(x\). The theorem states:
   \[
   a^2 + b^2 = c^2
   \]
   Here, \(a = x\), \(b = 24\), and \(c = 74\).

3. **Set Up the Equation**: Substitute the known values into the equation:
   \[
   x^2 + 24^2 = 74^2
   \]

4. **Calculate Squares**: Compute the squares of the known values:
   \[
   24^2 = 576
   \]
   \[
   74^2 = 5476
   \]

5. **Substitute Back into the Equation**:
   \[
   x^2 + 576 = 5476
   \]

6. **Isolate \(x^2\)**: Subtract 576 from both sides:
   \[
   x^2 = 5476 - 576
   \]
   \[
   x^2 = 4900
   \]

7. **Solve for \(x\)**: Take the square root of both sides:
   \[
   x = \sqrt{4900}
   \]
   \[
   x = 70
   \]

8. **Verify the Solution**: Check if \(70\) is one of the answer choices. It is.

9. **Conclusion**: The calculated value of \(x\) is 70, which matches answer choice C.
