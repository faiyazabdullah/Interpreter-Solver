To solve for \(x\), we need to use the property of parallel lines cut by a transversal. Specifically, the corresponding angles formed by these lines are equal. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify Corresponding Angles**: 
   - Angle \(G\) corresponds to angle \(K\) because they are on the same line and in the same position relative to the transversal.
   - Angle \(I\) corresponds to angle \(L\) because they are on the same line and in the same position relative to the transversal.
   - Angle \(D\) corresponds to angle \(A\) because they are on the same line and in the same position relative to the transversal.
   - Angle \(N\) corresponds to angle \(M\) because they are on the same line and in the same position relative to the transversal.

2. **Set Up Equations**:
   - Since the measures of corresponding angles are equal, we can set up the following equations based on the given expressions:
     \[
     7x - 2 = 4x + 3
     \]

3. **Solve for \(x\)**:
   - Subtract \(4x\) from both sides:
     \[
     7x - 4x - 2 = 3
     \]
     \[
     3x - 2 = 3
     \]
   - Add 2 to both sides:
     \[
     3x = 5
     \]
   - Divide by 3:
     \[
     x = \frac{5}{3}
     \]

</think>

Solution section:
Based on the calculation, the value of \(x\) is \(\frac{5}{3}\).
