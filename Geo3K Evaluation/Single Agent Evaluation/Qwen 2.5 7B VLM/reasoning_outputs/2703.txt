To solve for \( x \), we need to analyze the geometric figure and use the given information effectively. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Given Information:**
   - Triangle \( \triangle ABC \) has sides \( AB = 14 \), \( AC = 10 \), and \( BC = 18 \).
   - Point \( D \) lies on \( BC \) such that \( BD = x \) and \( DC = 18 - x \).

2. **Understand the Relationship:**
   - Since point \( D \) divides \( BC \) into two segments, we can apply the Angle Bisector Theorem or other geometric properties to find the relationship between the segments.

3. **Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem:**
   - The Angle Bisector Theorem states that if a point \( D \) bisects \( \angle BAC \), then the ratio of the lengths of the two segments created on \( BC \) will be equal to the ratio of the other two sides of the triangle.
   - However, in this case, it seems that \( AD \) does not necessarily bisect \( \angle BAC \). Therefore, we need another approach.

4. **Use the Law of Cosines:**
   - To find \( x \), we can use the Law of Cosines in \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle ADC \).

Let's calculate:

For \( \triangle ABD \):
\[ AB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2 - 2 \cdot AD \cdot BD \cdot \cos(\angle ADB) \]

For \( \triangle ADC \):
\[ AC^2 = AD^2 + DC^2 - 2 \cdot AD \cdot DC \cdot \cos(\angle ADC) \]

Since \( \angle ADB + \angle ADC = 180^\circ \), we have \( \cos(\angle ADB) = -\cos(\angle ADC) \).

Given the symmetry and the fact that the problem simplifies to finding the length \( x \) directly, we can use the fact that the total length \( BC = 18 \) and the segments sum up correctly.

By inspection and solving the equations, we can deduce:
\[ x = \frac{10 \times 14}{10 + 14} = \frac{140}{24} = 5.83 \approx 12 \]

Therefore, the closest value to our calculated result is:
