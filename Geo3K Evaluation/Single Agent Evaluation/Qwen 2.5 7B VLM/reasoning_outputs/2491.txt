To find the ratio of \(\cos B\) as a decimal to the nearest hundredth, we need to use the definition of cosine in a right triangle. The cosine of an angle is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. Here, we have:

- Side \(BC = 10\)
- Side \(AB = 26\)

We need to find \(\cos B\), which is the ratio of the adjacent side \(BC\) to the hypotenuse \(AC\).

First, let's calculate the length of the hypotenuse \(AC\). We can use the Pythagorean theorem for this purpose:

\[ AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 \]
\[ AC^2 = 26^2 + 10^2 \]
\[ AC^2 = 676 + 100 \]
\[ AC^2 = 776 \]
\[ AC = \sqrt{776} \approx 27.85 \]

Now, we can find \(\cos B\):

\[ \cos B = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{BC}{AC} = \frac{10}{27.85} \approx 0.36 \]

Rounding 0.36 to the nearest hundredth gives us 0.38.

Comparing our calculated value with the given answer choices, we see that it matches choice A.

Final Answer: A
