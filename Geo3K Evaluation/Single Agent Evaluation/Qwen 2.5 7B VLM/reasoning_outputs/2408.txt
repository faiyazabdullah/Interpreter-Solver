To solve this problem, let's analyze the given information and the geometric relationships in the figure:

1. **Identify Given Information**:
   - \( XN = 6 \)
   - \( XM = 2 \)
   - \( XY = 10 \)

2. **Understand the Geometric Relationships**:
   - The figure appears to be a triangle \( XYZ \) with point \( M \) on side \( XY \).
   - The triangles \( XNM \) and \( XMY \) seem to be congruent because they share angle \( X \), and sides \( XM \) and \( XN \) are equal (2 and 6 respectively).

3. **Calculate \( NY \)**:
   Since \( XN = 6 \) and \( XM = 2 \), we can infer that \( NY = XN - NM \). However, since \( M \) divides \( XY \) proportionally, we need to check the total length \( XY \).

4. **Total Length Calculation**:
   - Total length \( XY = XN + NY = 6 + NY \).
   - We know \( XY = 10 \).

5. **Find \( NY \)**:
   - Therefore, \( NY = 10 - 6 = 4 \).

6. **Calculate \( NZ \)**:
   - Since \( M \) divides \( XY \) proportionally and \( N \) lies on the extension of \( XY \) beyond \( Y \), we need to consider the total length \( NZ \).
   - \( NZ = NY + YZ \).

7. **Length \( YZ \)**:
   - Since \( YZ \) is part of the triangle and the total length \( XY = 10 \), and considering the proportional division, we can infer \( YZ = 6 \).

8. **Final Calculation**:
   - \( NZ = NY + YZ = 4 + 6 = 10 \).

However, it seems there might be a misinterpretation. Let's re-evaluate the problem:
- If \( NY = 4 \) and \( YZ = 6 \), then \( NZ = NY + YZ = 4 + 6 = 10 \).

Given the choices, it seems there might be a mistake in the interpretation. Revisiting the problem:

- If we assume \( NY = 4 \) and \( YZ = 6 \), then \( NZ = 4 + 6 = 10 \).

But the choices do not match. Let's recheck the problem again:

- If \( NY = 4 \) and \( YZ = 6 \), then \( NZ = 4 + 6 = 10 \).

Given the choices, the closest match is:
