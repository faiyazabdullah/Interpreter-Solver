<think>
First, let's analyze the given geometric figure. We have a quadrilateral \(PQRST\) where the sides \(PQ\), \(QR\), \(RS\), and \(SP\) are labeled with expressions involving \(x\). Specifically, we know:
- \(PQ = 6 - x\)
- \(QR = 6 + x\)
- \(RS = 3 + x\)

The problem asks us to find the length of \(PQ\).

Since no specific geometric theorem or property directly relates these side lengths without additional context (like congruence or similarity), we need to consider if there might be a simple arithmetic relationship or a pattern.

Given the symmetry and the fact that the problem seems straightforward, we can assume that the expression for \(PQ\) simplifies directly to one of the answer choices. Let's check the values of \(x\) that make sense:

If we set \(x = 0\):
- \(PQ = 6 - 0 = 6\)
- \(QR = 6 + 0 = 6\)
- \(RS = 3 + 0 = 3\)

This would form a triangle with sides \(6, 6, 3\), which is possible but not necessarily the only way to interpret the problem.

However, the simplest interpretation, considering the problem's directness, suggests that \(PQ = 6\) when \(x = 0\).

Let's verify if this fits the other choices:
- If \(x = 3\):
  - \(PQ = 6 - 3 = 3\)
  - This would mean \(QR = 9\) and \(RS = 6\), forming a triangle with sides \(3, 9, 6\), which is also possible but different from our initial assumption.

Given the simplicity and directness of the problem, the most reasonable assumption is that \(x = 0\) makes the most sense.

Thus, the length of \(PQ\) is \(6\).

Solution:
Based on the analysis, the length of \(PQ\) is \(6\).
