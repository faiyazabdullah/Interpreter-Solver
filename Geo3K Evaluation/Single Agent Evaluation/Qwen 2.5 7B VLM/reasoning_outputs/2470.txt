Let's start by analyzing the given information:

1. We have a rhombus LMPQ.
2. The measure of angle QLM is given as \(2x^2 - 10\).
3. The measure of angle QPM is given as \(8x\).
4. The side MP is given as 10.

Since LMPQ is a rhombus, all sides are equal, so LM = MP = PQ = LQ = 10.

Next, let's use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is always 360 degrees. For a rhombus, opposite angles are equal and adjacent angles are supplementary (add up to 180 degrees).

Thus, we can set up the equation for the sum of the angles:
\[ \text{m}\angle QLM + \text{m}\angle QPM + \text{m}\angle PMQ + \text{m}\angle QML = 360^\circ \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ (2x^2 - 10) + 8x + (2x^2 - 10) + (8x) = 360 \]
\[ 4x^2 + 16x - 20 = 360 \]
\[ 4x^2 + 16x - 380 = 0 \]
\[ x^2 + 4x - 95 = 0 \]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -95\):
\[ x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-95)}}{2 \cdot 1} \]
\[ x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 380}}{2} \]
\[ x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{396}}{2} \]
\[ x = \frac{-4 \pm 19.9}{2} \]

This gives us two potential values for x:
\[ x = \frac{-4 + 19.9}{2} = 7.95 \]
\[ x = \frac{-4 - 19.9}{2} = -11.95 \]

Since x represents an angle measure and must be positive, we take \(x = 7.95\).

Now, substituting \(x = 7.95\) back into the expressions for the angles:
\[ \text{m}\angle QLM = 2(7.95)^2 - 10 = 2(63.2025) - 10 = 126.405 - 10 = 116.405 \]
\[ \text{m}\angle QPM = 8(7.95) = 63.6 \]

Since these angles do not add up correctly to the sum of the angles in a quadrilateral, it seems there might be an error. However, the perimeter of the rhombus is simply the sum of its sides:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = LM + MP + PQ + LQ = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40 \]

Thus, the perimeter is 40.

Solution:
The perimeter of the rhombus LMPQ is 40.
