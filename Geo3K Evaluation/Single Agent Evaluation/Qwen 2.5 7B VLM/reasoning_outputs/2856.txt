Let's analyze the geometric figure:

1. The segment \( AB \) is tangent to the circle at point \( D \).
2. Point \( D \) lies on the circle.
3. Points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \) form a quadrilateral.
4. Segment \( AC \) is a straight line with length 18.
5. Segment \( BC \) is a straight line with length 30.
6. We need to find the length \( x \) of segment \( AB \).

Since \( AB \) is tangent to the circle at \( D \), we can use the Power of a Point theorem. According to the theorem, the power of point \( A \) with respect to the circle is equal to the square of the tangent segment from \( A \) to the point of tangency \( D \):

\[ AD^2 = AB \cdot AC \]

We know:
- \( AD = x \)
- \( AC = 18 \)

Substituting these values into the equation:

\[ x^2 = AB \cdot 18 \]

However, we also know that \( AB + BD = BC \). Since \( BD = AD \) (because \( AB \) is tangent at \( D \)), we have:

\[ AB + AD = BC \]
\[ AB + x = 30 \]

From this, we get:
\[ AB = 30 - x \]

Substitute \( AB = 30 - x \) into the power of a point equation:

\[ x^2 = (30 - x) \cdot 18 \]
\[ x^2 = 540 - 18x \]
\[ x^2 + 18x - 540 = 0 \]

This is a quadratic equation. Solving it using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \):

Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 18 \), and \( c = -540 \):

\[ x = \frac{-18 \pm \sqrt{18^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-540)}}{2 \cdot 1} \]
\[ x = \frac{-18 \pm \sqrt{324 + 2160}}{2} \]
\[ x = \frac{-18 \pm \sqrt{2484}}{2} \]
\[ x = \frac{-18 \pm 49.84}{2} \]

This gives us two potential solutions:
\[ x = \frac{31.84}{2} = 15.92 \]
\[ x = \frac{-67.84}{2} = -33.92 \]

Since \( x \) represents a length, it must be positive. Therefore, the correct value is:

\[ x \approx 16 \]

Comparing this with the answer choices:
A. 16
B. 18
C. 30
D. 34
