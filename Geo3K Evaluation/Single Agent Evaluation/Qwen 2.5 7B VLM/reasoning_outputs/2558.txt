To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of RS given that triangle QRST is an equilateral triangle. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the given lengths:**
   - QR = 4x
   - RS = 2x + 1
   - QS = 6x - 1

2. **Understand the properties of an equilateral triangle:**
   - All sides of an equilateral triangle are equal.

3. **Set up the equation for the side lengths:**
   Since QR, RS, and QS are all equal in an equilateral triangle, we can set up the following equations:
   - QR = RS
   - QR = QS
   - RS = QS

   Therefore:
   - 4x = 2x + 1
   - 4x = 6x - 1

4. **Solve the first equation (4x = 2x + 1):**
   \[
   4x - 2x = 1
   \]
   \[
   2x = 1
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

5. **Substitute \( x = \frac{1}{2} \) into the expression for RS:**
   \[
   RS = 2x + 1 = 2 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
   \]

6. **Verify the second equation (4x = 6x - 1):**
   \[
   4x - 6x = -1
   \]
   \[
   -2x = -1
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

Since both equations confirm \( x = \frac{1}{2} \), the length of RS is indeed 2.
