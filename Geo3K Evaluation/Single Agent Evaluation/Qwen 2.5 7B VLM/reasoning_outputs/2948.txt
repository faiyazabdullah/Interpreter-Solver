First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric relationships:

1. AD is perpendicular to BC, which means ∠ADB = ∠ADC = 90°.
2. AB is perpendicular to AC, which means ∠BAC = 90°.
3. BD = 5 (given).

Since ∠BAC = 90°, triangle ABC forms a right triangle with right angle at A. 

Because AD is perpendicular to BC, triangles ABD and ADC are also right triangles.

We need to find the length of BC. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find BC.

For triangle ABD:
\[ AB^2 + BD^2 = AD^2 \]
Given \( AB = 10 \) and \( BD = 5 \):
\[ 10^2 + 5^2 = AD^2 \]
\[ 100 + 25 = AD^2 \]
\[ 125 = AD^2 \]
\[ AD = \sqrt{125} = 5\sqrt{5} \]

For triangle ADC:
Since AD is common and both triangles share the same height from A to BC, we can use the fact that the area of the triangle can be calculated in two ways:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times AD \]
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times BD \]

Equating the areas:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5\sqrt{5} = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times 5 \]
\[ 50\sqrt{5} = AC \times 5 \]
\[ AC = 10\sqrt{5} \]

Now, using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ABC:
\[ AB^2 + AC^2 = BC^2 \]
\[ 10^2 + (10\sqrt{5})^2 = BC^2 \]
\[ 100 + 500 = BC^2 \]
\[ 600 = BC^2 \]
\[ BC = \sqrt{600} = 10\sqrt{6} \]

However, it seems there might be a simpler approach considering the choices provided. Let's re-evaluate with simpler trigonometric relations:

Since ∠BAC = 90° and ∠ADB = 90°, and knowing BD = 5, we can infer that triangle ABD is a 3-4-5 right triangle scaled up. Thus, AB = 10 implies that BD = 5 and AD = 5√3. This simplifies our problem significantly.

Revisiting the simpler approach:
If AD = 5√3 and BD = 5, then in triangle ABD, AB = 10, so using the Pythagorean theorem again for BC:
\[ AB^2 + AC^2 = BC^2 \]
\[ 10^2 + (10\sqrt{3})^2 = BC^2 \]
\[ 100 + 300 = BC^2 \]
\[ 400 = BC^2 \]
\[ BC = \sqrt{400} = 20 \]

Thus, the correct value of BC is 20.
