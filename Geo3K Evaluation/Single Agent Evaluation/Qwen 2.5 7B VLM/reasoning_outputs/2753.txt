Let's analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the given information**:
   - The figure shows a circle with a radius of 17 units.
   - There is a line segment that appears to be tangent to the circle at point X.
   - The length of the tangent segment DX is given as 8.1 units.
   - The length of the chord AB is given as 17 units.

2. **Understand the problem**:
   - We need to find the length of segment XE, which is the tangent segment from point E outside the circle to the point of tangency X.

3. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem**:
   - Since DX is tangent to the circle at X, the right triangle DXE can be formed.
   - The hypotenuse DE = DX + EX = 8.1 + X.
   - The legs of the right triangle are DX and EX.
   - The hypotenuse DE forms a right angle with the radius EX at point X.

4. **Set up the equation**:
   - According to the Pythagorean theorem: \(DX^2 + EX^2 = DE^2\).
   - Substituting the known values: \(8.1^2 + X^2 = (8.1 + X)^2\).

5. **Simplify the equation**:
   - Expand and simplify: \(65.61 + X^2 = 65.61 + 16.2X + X^2\).
   - Subtract \(X^2\) from both sides: \(65.61 = 16.2X\).
   - Solve for X: \(X = \frac{65.61}{16.2} \approx 4.03\).

6. **Check the closest answer choice**:
   - The calculated value of X is approximately 4.03.
   - The closest answer choice to 4.03 is 4.0.

Since none of the provided choices match our calculated value, we need to select the closest answer choice from the given options.
