Let's start by analyzing the given information and the geometric relationships in the diagram:

1. **Identify the given angles:**
   - \(\angle AFB = 72^\circ\)
   - \(\angle AFD = (4a - 1)^\circ\)
   - \(\angle ADB = (2a - 5)^\circ\)

2. **Understand the relationship between the angles:**
   - Since \(F\) is the center of the circle, \(\angle ADB\) is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc \(AB\).
   - According to the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

3. **Calculate the measure of arc \(AB\):**
   - Let the measure of arc \(AB\) be \(x\).
   - Therefore, \(\angle ADB = \frac{1}{2} x\).

4. **Set up the equation using the given angle:**
   - We know \(\angle ADB = 2a - 5\).
   - So, we have \(\frac{1}{2} x = 2a - 5\).

5. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - Multiply both sides by 2: \(x = 4a - 10\).

6. **Determine the measure of arc \(AC\):**
   - Arc \(AC\) is a semicircle because \(AC\) is the diameter.
   - The measure of a semicircle is \(180^\circ\).

7. **Relate the arcs:**
   - Since the sum of the measures of arcs \(AB\) and \(BC\) is equal to the measure of arc \(AC\), we have:
     \[
     x + \text{(measure of arc } BC) = 180^\circ
     \]
   - The measure of arc \(BC\) can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{(measure of arc } BC) = 180^\circ - x = 180^\circ - (4a - 10) = 190^\circ - 4a
     \]

8. **Use the given angle \(\angle AFB = 72^\circ\):**
   - \(\angle AFB\) is an external angle to the triangle formed by points \(A\), \(F\), and \(B\).
   - The measure of \(\angle AFB\) is related to the angles at \(A\) and \(B\) in the triangle \(AFB\).

9. **Calculate \(\angle AFB\):**
   - Since \(\angle AFB = 72^\circ\), and considering the triangle properties, we need to find the relationship with the given angles.

By comparing the given angle \(\angle AFB = 72^\circ\) with the options provided, we see that it matches directly with option B.
