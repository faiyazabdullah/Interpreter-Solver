To find the area of the figure, let's analyze the given information:

1. The figure is a rectangle.
2. The length of the rectangle is 15 mm.
3. The width of the rectangle is also 15 mm (since opposite sides of a rectangle are equal).
4. There is a diagonal connecting the vertices A and C, forming a right angle at point D.

Since the diagonal divides the rectangle into two congruent right triangles, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to confirm the diagonal's length.

However, the problem only asks for the area of the rectangle, which is simply the product of its length and width.

Let's calculate the area:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 15 \, \text{mm} \times 15 \, \text{mm} = 225 \, \text{mm}^2 \]

Now, let's compare this with the given answer choices:
A. 75
B. 112.5
C. 129.9
D. 225

The calculated area matches exactly with option D.
