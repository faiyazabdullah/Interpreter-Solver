To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of \(\cos A\). Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the Right Triangle**: The triangle \(ABC\) is a right triangle with the right angle at \(B\). The hypotenuse \(AC = 25\), and the legs \(AB = 15\) and \(BC = 20\).

2. **Calculate \(\cos A\)**: The cosine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. Here, the adjacent side to angle \(A\) is \(BC\), and the hypotenuse is \(AC\).

   \[
   \cos A = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{BC}{AC} = \frac{20}{25}
   \]

3. **Simplify the Ratio**: Simplify the fraction \(\frac{20}{25}\):

   \[
   \frac{20}{25} = \frac{4}{5} = 0.8
   \]

4. **Round to the Nearest Hundredth**: The value \(0.8\) is already rounded to the nearest hundredth.

5. **Compare with Answer Choices**: The calculated value \(0.8\) matches with the answer choice C.

Final Answer: C
