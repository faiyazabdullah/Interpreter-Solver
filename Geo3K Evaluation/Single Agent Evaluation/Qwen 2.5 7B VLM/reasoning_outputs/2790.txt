To solve for SV, let's analyze the given information and the geometric relationships in the figure:

1. We know UJ = 9 and VJ = 3.
2. ZT = 18, which seems to be a diagonal line connecting points Z and T.

We need to find SV.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
- Since UJ = 9 and VJ = 3, we can infer that UV = UJ + VJ = 9 + 3 = 12.
- ZT = 18 suggests that ZT is the sum of some segments, but it does not directly help us find SV without additional information about the triangles or quadrilaterals formed.

Given the provided options and the lack of direct geometric relationships between SV and the known lengths, we need to consider the simplest possible relationship:

- If SV were to be equal to the length of another segment that is part of the figure and can be derived from the given lengths, then SV could potentially be the sum or difference of the known lengths.

However, the most straightforward interpretation here is to assume SV is a segment that can be derived from the known lengths. Given the options and the simplicity of the problem, we can infer that SV might be one of the provided lengths.

Considering the lengths and the options provided:
- If SV = 3 (option A), it would make sense if SV were directly proportional or a simple subtraction from another segment.
- If SV = 6 (option B), it could be half of UV.
- If SV = 9 (option C), it could be the same as UJ.
- If SV = 12 (option D), it matches UV.

Since UV = 12 and SV cannot be greater than UV unless there is a specific geometric configuration not depicted, the most plausible and simplest solution is SV = 6.

Thus, based on the given options and the simplest geometric interpretation, the answer should be:
