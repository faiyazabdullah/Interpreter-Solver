Let's analyze the given geometric figure:

1. We have a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
2. Angle \( \angle B = 30^\circ \).
3. Side \( BC = 14\sqrt{3} \).
4. We need to find the length of side \( AC = x \).

We can use the Law of Sines to find \( x \). The Law of Sines states:

\[
\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}
\]

Here, we have:
- Side \( BC = a = 14\sqrt{3} \)
- Angle \( B = 30^\circ \)

We need to find angle \( C \) first. Since the sum of angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \):

\[
\angle A + \angle B + \angle C = 180^\circ
\]

Given \( \angle B = 30^\circ \), let's denote \( \angle A = \alpha \) and \( \angle C = \beta \).

Since we do not have enough information to directly calculate \( \alpha \) or \( \beta \), we will use the fact that the triangle is split into a right triangle at point \( C \) because of the perpendicular line drawn from \( C \).

Using the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle, we know:
- The side opposite the 30° angle is half the hypotenuse.
- The side opposite the 60° angle is \( \sqrt{3}/2 \) times the hypotenuse.

Thus:
- If \( BC = 14\sqrt{3} \), then the side opposite the 30° angle (which is \( AC \)) is:
\[
AC = \frac{BC}{2} = \frac{14\sqrt{3}}{2} = 7\sqrt{3}
\]

Therefore, the value of \( x \) is \( 7\sqrt{3} \).

Comparing our calculated value with the given answer choices, we see that none of them match exactly. However, the closest value to \( 7\sqrt{3} \) among the choices is approximately \( 12 \) (since \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \Rightarrow 7 \times 1.732 \approx 12.124 \)).

Given the choices provided, the closest value is \( 14 \sqrt{3} \).
