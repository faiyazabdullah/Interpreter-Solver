To solve for \( x \) in the given geometric figure, let's analyze the information provided:

1. The figure includes a pentagon labeled \( W, X, Y, Z, W' \).
2. There are several parallel lines and segments indicated.
3. The lengths \( WY = 14 \) and \( YZ = 10.5 \) are given.
4. We need to find the value of \( x \), which seems to be the length of segment \( WX \).

Given that \( WY = 14 \) and \( YZ = 10.5 \), we can infer that these lengths are part of the same side of the pentagon. If \( x \) represents the length of \( WX \), and considering the symmetry and the properties of the pentagon, it appears that \( x \) would be half of the total length of the side \( WY \) and \( YZ \) combined.

Let's calculate:
\[ x = \frac{WY + YZ}{2} = \frac{14 + 10.5}{2} = \frac{24.5}{2} = 12.25 \]

Since none of the answer choices match 12.25 exactly, we need to check the closest option. The closest value among the provided choices is 14, but since it's not available, the next closest is 10.5, which is the actual calculated value divided by 2.

Therefore, the closest answer choice is:
