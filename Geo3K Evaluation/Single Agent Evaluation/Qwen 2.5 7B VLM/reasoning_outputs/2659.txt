<think>
First, let's analyze the given information:

1. \(\triangle IWN\) is an equilateral triangle.
2. \(W N = 5\).

Since \(\triangle IWN\) is equilateral, all its sides are equal. Therefore, \(IW = WN = IN = 5\).

Next, we need to find \(\widehat{WN}\), which represents the central angle subtended by the arc \(WN\) at the center of the circle. 

In an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle, each side of the triangle is a chord of the circle, and each angle subtended by these chords at the center is \(120^\circ\) (or \(\frac{2\pi}{3}\) radians).

Thus, \(\widehat{WN} = 120^\circ = \frac{2\pi}{3}\) radians.

Now, we compare our result with the given answer choices:

A. \(\frac{3}{5}\pi\)
B. \(\frac{5}{3}\pi\)
C. \(5\pi\)
D. \(10\pi\)

Clearly, \(\frac{2\pi}{3}\) does not match any of the given options directly. However, we need to find the closest option.

Since \(\frac{2\pi}{3} \approx 2.094\), it is closest to \(\frac{5}{3}\pi \approx 1.667\pi\).

Therefore, the closest option is B.

Final Answer: B</think>
<thought>
We have determined that \(\widehat{WN} = \frac{2\pi}{3}\). Comparing this with the given options, the closest value is \(\frac{5}{3}\pi\).

Final Answer: B</thought>
