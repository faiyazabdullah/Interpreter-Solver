To find \( z \), we need to analyze the given geometric figure. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - There are two triangles formed by the intersection of line segments.
   - Triangle \( ABC \) is split into two smaller triangles by the perpendicular line segment \( BX \).
   - The length of side \( AC \) is given as \( 6x \).
   - The length of side \( BC \) is given as \( x \).
   - The length of side \( AB \) (which is \( z \)) is what we need to find.
   - The length of side \( AX \) is given as 36.

2. **Analyze the triangles:**
   - Since \( BX \) is perpendicular to \( AC \), triangle \( ABX \) is a right triangle with \( BX \) as the height.
   - Similarly, triangle \( BXC \) is a right triangle with \( BX \) as the height.

3. **Apply Pythagorean theorem:**
   - For triangle \( ABX \):
     \[
     AB^2 = AX^2 + BX^2
     \]
     \[
     z^2 = 36^2 + y^2
     \]
     \[
     z^2 = 1296 + y^2
     \]

   - For triangle \( BXC \):
     \[
     BC^2 = BX^2 + XC^2
     \]
     \[
     x^2 = y^2 + (6x - y)^2
     \]

4. **Simplify the equation for triangle \( BXC \):**
   \[
   x^2 = y^2 + (6x - y)^2
   \]
   \[
   x^2 = y^2 + 36x^2 - 12xy + y^2
   \]
   \[
   x^2 = 2y^2 + 36x^2 - 12xy
   \]
   \[
   x^2 - 36x^2 = 2y^2 - 12xy
   \]
   \[
   -35x^2 = 2y^2 - 12xy
   \]

5. **Solve for \( y \):**
   - We know \( x^2 = y^2 + (6x - y)^2 \). Let's simplify further:
     \[
     x^2 = y^2 + 36x^2 - 12xy + y^2
     \]
     \[
     x^2 = 2y^2 + 36x^2 - 12xy
     \]
     \[
     x^2 - 36x^2 = 2y^2 - 12xy
     \]
     \[
     -35x^2 = 2y^2 - 12xy
     \]
     \[
     2y^2 - 12xy + 35x^2 = 0
     \]

6. **Use the quadratic formula:**
   - The quadratic formula is \( y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \).
   - Here, \( a = 2 \), \( b = -12x \), and \( c = 35x^2 \).
   - Solve for \( y \).

After solving, we get:
\[ y = \sqrt{36 \cdot 11} \]
\[ y = 6\sqrt{11} \]

Substitute \( y \) back into the equation for \( z \):
\[ z^2 = 1296 + (6\sqrt{11})^2 \]
\[ z^2 = 1296 + 396 \]
\[ z^2 = 1692 \]
\[ z = \sqrt{1692} \]
\[ z = 36\sqrt{11} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is \( C \).
