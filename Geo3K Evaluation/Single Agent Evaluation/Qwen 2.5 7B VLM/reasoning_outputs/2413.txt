<think>
Let's analyze the given information and the geometric relationships step by step:

1. **Identify the Rhombus Properties**: 
   - All sides of a rhombus are equal in length.
   - Opposite angles are equal.
   - Diagonals bisect each other at right angles and also bisect the angles of the rhombus.

2. **Given Information**:
   - \( m\angle DAB = 2^\circ \).
   - \( CB = 6 \).
   - Since it's a rhombus, \( DA = AB = BC = CD \).

3. **Angle Relationships**:
   - Since \( m\angle DAB = 2^\circ \), we know that \( m\angle ABC = 2^\circ \) (opposite angles are equal in a rhombus).
   - Because diagonals of a rhombus bisect the angles, \( m\angle DAE = m\angle EAB = 1^\circ \).

4. **Finding \( m\angle ACD \)**:
   - To find \( m\angle ACD \), we need to consider the total angle around point \( A \). Since \( m\angle DAB = 2^\circ \) and the sum of angles around point \( A \) is \( 360^\circ \), we can use the fact that diagonals bisect these angles.
   - Since \( m\angle DAE = m\angle EAB = 1^\circ \), and considering the symmetry of the rhombus, the remaining angle \( m\angle ACD \) would be half of the remaining part after subtracting the given angle.

Since the total angle around \( A \) is \( 360^\circ \) and considering the symmetry and given angles, the angle \( m\angle ACD \) should logically be \( 90^\circ \).

<solution>
Based on the analysis, the correct measure for \( m\angle ACD \) is \( 90^\circ \).
