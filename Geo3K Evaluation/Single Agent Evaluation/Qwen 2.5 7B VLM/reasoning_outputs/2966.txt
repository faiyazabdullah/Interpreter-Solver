<think>
To find the value of \( z \) in the given parallelogram, we need to use the properties of a parallelogram. Specifically, the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other, meaning they split each other into two equal segments.

Given:
- One diagonal segment is labeled as \( 3z - 4 \).
- The other diagonal segment is labeled as \( z + 5 \).

Since the diagonals bisect each other, these segments must be equal because they are opposite sides of the parallelogram formed by the intersection of the diagonals.

So, we set up the equation:
\[ 3z - 4 = z + 5 \]

Now, let's solve for \( z \):

1. Subtract \( z \) from both sides:
   \[ 3z - z - 4 = 5 \]
   \[ 2z - 4 = 5 \]

2. Add 4 to both sides:
   \[ 2z - 4 + 4 = 5 + 4 \]
   \[ 2z = 9 \]

3. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[ z = \frac{9}{2} \]
   \[ z = 4.5 \]

</think>

The calculated value of \( z \) is 4.5.
