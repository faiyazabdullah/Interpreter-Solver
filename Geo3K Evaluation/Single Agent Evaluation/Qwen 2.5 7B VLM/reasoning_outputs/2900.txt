First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric figure:

1. The figure is a right triangle (indicated by the right angle at vertex A).
2. One of the sides is labeled as 5 inches.
3. The angle at vertex C is 59 degrees.
4. We need to find the area of the triangle.

To find the area of a right triangle, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

In this case, the side of 5 inches can be either the base or the height, depending on which side forms the right angle. Since the angle at C is 59 degrees, it suggests that the side of 5 inches could be the hypotenuse or one of the legs. However, without additional information about the other side, we can infer that the side of 5 inches is likely one of the legs (since it fits the right angle scenario).

Let's assume the side of 5 inches is the height. Then the base would be the adjacent side to the right angle, which can be found using trigonometry:
\[ \text{Base} = \frac{\text{Adjacent}}{\cos(59^\circ)} \]

However, for simplicity and to directly find the area, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the other leg. But since the problem asks for the area and the height is known, we can directly use the formula with the height as 5 inches and the base as the adjacent side calculated from the cosine function.

Since the height is 5 inches and the angle at C is 59 degrees, the base can be found using:
\[ \text{Base} = \frac{5}{\sin(59^\circ)} \]

But for simplicity, we can use the fact that the area is:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 5 \times \text{Base} \]

Given the angle and the height, we can calculate:
\[ \text{Base} = \frac{5}{\sin(59^\circ)} \approx 4.1 \]

Now, substituting these values into the area formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 5 \times 4.1 \approx 10.25 \]

Rounding to the nearest hundredth:
\[ \text{Area} \approx 10.25 \]

Comparing with the given answer choices:
A. 3.76
B. 7.51
C. 13.84
D. 15.02

The closest value is 13.84.
