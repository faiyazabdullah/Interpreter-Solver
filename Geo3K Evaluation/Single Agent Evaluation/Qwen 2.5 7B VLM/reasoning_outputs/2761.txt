To solve for \( x \) in the given geometric figure, we need to analyze the relationships between the sides and the angles. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identify Similar Triangles**: The figure appears to show two similar triangles, \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle XYZ\). This is indicated by the equal markings (\(|||\)) which suggest corresponding sides are proportional.

2. **Set Up Proportions**: Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of their corresponding sides are equal. We can write the proportion using the given side lengths:
   \[
   \frac{BC}{XZ} = \frac{AB}{XY}
   \]
   Given:
   \[
   BC = 3x, \quad XZ = 6, \quad AB = 8, \quad XY = x
   \]

3. **Substitute Known Values**: Substitute the known values into the proportion:
   \[
   \frac{3x}{6} = \frac{8}{x}
   \]

4. **Simplify the Proportion**: Simplify the left side:
   \[
   \frac{3x}{6} = \frac{x}{2}
   \]

5. **Cross-Multiply**: To eliminate the fractions, cross-multiply:
   \[
   3x \cdot x = 6 \cdot 8
   \]
   \[
   3x^2 = 48
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \)**: Divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   x^2 = 16
   \]
   Take the square root of both sides:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

7. **Verify the Solution**: Check if \( x = 4 \) satisfies the original proportion:
   \[
   \frac{3 \cdot 4}{6} = \frac{8}{4}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{12}{6} = 2 \neq 2
   \]

Since there was a miscalculation, let's re-evaluate the setup:
   \[
   \frac{3x}{6} = \frac{8}{x}
   \]
   Cross-multiplying again:
   \[
   3x^2 = 48
   \]
   Correctly solving:
   \[
   x^2 = 16 \implies x = 4
   \]

Thus, the correct value of \( x \) is 4.
