Let's analyze the image step by step:

1. **Identify the Right Triangle**: The image shows a right triangle with vertices labeled A, B, and C. The right angle is at vertex C.

2. **Given Information**:
   - The side AC (one leg of the triangle) is 5 feet long.
   - The side BC (the other leg of the triangle) is 12 feet long.
   - The hypotenuse AB is the side we need to find.

3. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**: The Pythagorean Theorem states that for a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a and b). Mathematically, it is expressed as:
   \[
   c^2 = a^2 + b^2
   \]
   Here, \( c = AB \), \( a = AC = 5 \) ft, and \( b = BC = 12 \) ft.

4. **Substitute the Values**:
   \[
   AB^2 = 5^2 + 12^2
   \]

5. **Calculate Squares**:
   \[
   AB^2 = 25 + 144
   \]

6. **Sum the Squares**:
   \[
   AB^2 = 169
   \]

7. **Find the Square Root**:
   \[
   AB = \sqrt{169} = 13
   \]

Thus, the length of the hypotenuse AB is 13 feet.

Now, let's compare our calculated result with the given answer choices:

- A. 5
- B. \sqrt{119}
- C. 12
- D. 13

The closest match to our calculated result (13) is option D.

Final Answer: D
