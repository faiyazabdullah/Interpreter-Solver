<think>
Let's analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the Shape**: The figure appears to be a parallelogram, as indicated by the equal lengths of sides \(JL\) and \(MK\) (both 6 units), and the parallel lines marked between the pairs of opposite sides.

2. **Analyze Angles**:
   - We are given that \(\angle NML = 80^\circ\).
   - In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary (sum up to 180 degrees).

3. **Find Adjacent Angle**:
   - Since \(\angle NML = 80^\circ\), its adjacent angle \(\angle NLM\) will be:
     \[
     \angle NLM = 180^\circ - 80^\circ = 100^\circ
     \]

4. **Relate to Other Angles**:
   - Since \(JLK\) is part of the same parallelogram, the angle \(\angle JKL\) will be equal to \(\angle NLM\) because they are corresponding angles in the parallelogram.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, \(\angle JKL = 100^\circ\).

</think>

<solution>
Given the analysis, we conclude that \(\angle JKL = 100^\circ\).
