To solve this problem, we need to use the fact that the sum of angles around a point is always 360 degrees. Let's analyze the given angles:

1. **Identify the angles**: The angles given are \( \angle 1 \), \( \angle 3 \), and \( \angle 4 \).
2. **Set up the equation**: Since these angles form a straight line (or part of a circle) at point O, their sum should equal 180 degrees because they are linearly related. However, since they are part of a larger circle, the total angle around point O is 360 degrees.

Given:
- \( \angle 1 = 4p + 15 \)
- \( \angle 3 = 3p - 10 \)
- \( \angle 4 = 6r + 5 \)

Since the sum of these angles around point O is 360 degrees, we can set up the equation:
\[ \angle 1 + \angle 3 + \angle 4 = 360 \]

Substitute the given expressions for the angles:
\[ (4p + 15) + (3p - 10) + (6r + 5) = 360 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 4p + 3p + 6r + 15 - 10 + 5 = 360 \]
\[ 7p + 6r + 10 = 360 \]

Since the problem only asks for the value of \( p \) and does not give a specific value for \( r \), we can simplify further by isolating \( p \):
\[ 7p + 6r + 10 = 360 \]
\[ 7p + 6r = 350 \]

However, we notice that the problem does not provide a value for \( r \). Given the options, it seems we might need to solve for \( p \) directly without involving \( r \).

Let's assume the simplest case where \( r = 0 \) for simplicity (since the problem does not specify \( r \)):
\[ 7p + 6(0) + 10 = 360 \]
\[ 7p + 10 = 360 \]
\[ 7p = 350 \]
\[ p = 50 \]

This value does not match any of the provided answer choices. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the given choices.

Given choices are:
A. 15
B. 20
C. 25
D. 30

Let's check each option:
If \( p = 15 \):
\[ 7(15) + 6r + 10 = 360 \]
\[ 105 + 6r + 10 = 360 \]
\[ 115 + 6r = 360 \]
\[ 6r = 245 \]
\[ r = \frac{245}{6} \approx 40.83 \]

If \( p = 20 \):
\[ 7(20) + 6r + 10 = 360 \]
\[ 140 + 6r + 10 = 360 \]
\[ 150 + 6r = 360 \]
\[ 6r = 210 \]
\[ r = \frac{210}{6} = 35 \]

If \( p = 25 \):
\[ 7(25) + 6r + 10 = 360 \]
\[ 175 + 6r + 10 = 360 \]
\[ 185 + 6r = 360 \]
\[ 6r = 175 \]
\[ r = \frac{175}{6} \approx 29.17 \]

If \( p = 30 \):
\[ 7(30) + 6r + 10 = 360 \]
\[ 210 + 6r + 10 = 360 \]
\[ 220 + 6r = 360 \]
\[ 6r = 140 \]
\[ r = \frac{140}{6} \approx 23.33 \]

The closest value that matches the options is \( p = 20 \).
