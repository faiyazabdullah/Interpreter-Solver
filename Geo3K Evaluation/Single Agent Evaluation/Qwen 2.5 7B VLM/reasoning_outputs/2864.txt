To solve this problem, we need to determine the cosine of angle \(N\). The cosine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. 

Given:
- The length of the adjacent side \(PN\) is 15.
- The length of the hypotenuse \(NM\) is 39.

We can use the formula for cosine:
\[
\cos N = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{15}{39}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the value of \(\frac{15}{39}\) and round it to the nearest hundredth.

Let's perform the calculation:
\[
\frac{15}{39} \approx 0.3846
\]

Rounding 0.3846 to the nearest hundredth gives us 0.38.

Now, let's compare this result with the given answer choices:
- A. 0.38
- B. 0.42
- C. 0.92
- D. 2.40

The closest value to 0.38 is 0.38 itself.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
Final Answer: A
