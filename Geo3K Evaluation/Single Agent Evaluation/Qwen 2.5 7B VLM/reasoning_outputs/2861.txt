To solve this problem, we need to determine which angles are supplementary to \(\angle 1\). Supplementary angles are pairs of angles whose measures add up to 180 degrees.

1. **Identify the relationship between lines and angles:**
   - Since line \(l\) is parallel to line \(m\), the corresponding angles and alternate interior angles will have specific relationships.

2. **Analyze the angles around \(\angle 1\):**
   - \(\angle 1\) is located at point \(D\) on line \(n\).
   - The angle directly adjacent to \(\angle 1\) on the same side of line \(n\) is \(\angle 2\). These two angles form a linear pair, so they are supplementary.
   - \(\angle 3\) is the alternate interior angle to \(\angle 1\) with respect to lines \(l\) and \(m\). According to the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem, these angles are equal.

3. **Check for supplementary angles to \(\angle 1\):**
   - \(\angle 2\) and \(\angle 1\) are supplementary because they form a linear pair.
   - \(\angle 3\) and \(\angle 1\) are supplementary because they are alternate interior angles formed by the intersection of line \(n\) with lines \(l\) and \(m\).

4. **Consider additional angles:**
   - \(\angle 4\) is the next angle in the sequence but it forms another linear pair with \(\angle 3\) and thus is supplementary to \(\angle 2\), not \(\angle 1\).
   - \(\angle 5\), \(\angle 6\), and \(\angle 7\) are not directly related to \(\angle 1\) as they do not form linear pairs with it or alternate interior angles.

Based on the analysis, the angles supplementary to \(\angle 1\) are \(\angle 2\) and \(\angle 3\).

The angles supplementary to \(\angle 1\) are \(\angle 2\) and \(\angle 3\).
