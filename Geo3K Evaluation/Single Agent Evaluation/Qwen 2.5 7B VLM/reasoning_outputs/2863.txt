Let's analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify Given Information and Relationships**:
   - We know \(m\angle 4 = m\angle 5\).
   - \(\angle 4\) and \(\angle 5\) are adjacent angles on the straight line \(CD\), which means they form a linear pair.
   - Since \(\angle 4 + \angle 5 = 180^\circ\), we can write: \(\angle 4 + \angle 5 = 180^\circ\).

2. **Given Angles**:
   - \(\angle 4 = x\) (unknown)
   - \(\angle 5 = x\) (since \(m\angle 4 = m\angle 5\))

3. **Set Up the Equation**:
   \[
   x + x = 180^\circ
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   2x = 180^\circ
   \]

4. **Solve for \(x\)**:
   \[
   x = \frac{180^\circ}{2} = 90^\circ
   \]

Since \(m\angle 4 = m\angle 5 = 90^\circ\), we need to find the measure of \(\angle 7\). However, there seems to be a misunderstanding because \(\angle 7\) is not directly related to \(\angle 4\) or \(\angle 5\) in the given information. Let's re-evaluate the problem:

- \(\angle 7\) is part of triangle \(EFG\) and is given as \(7\) units long.
- We need to consider the angles around point \(B\), but since \(\angle 4\) and \(\angle 5\) are not connected to \(\angle 7\) directly, we must focus on the given angles and their relationships.

Given the options and the provided angles:
- \(\angle 4 = 90^\circ\)
- \(\angle 5 = 90^\circ\)

The only angle we can directly use from the given options is \(\angle 7\), which seems to be a direct measurement or a derived value from the given angles. Given the options:
- The closest angle to our derived angle of \(90^\circ\) is \(69^\circ\).

Thus, the most reasonable answer is:
