Let's analyze the geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - There is a right triangle with sides labeled \(x\), \(z\), and hypotenuse \(y = 14\).
   - One of the legs of the right triangle is \(z\).
   - The hypotenuse \(y\) is given as 14.
   - The other leg of the triangle is part of a larger shape involving another side length \(5\).

2. **Understand the relationship:**
   - The triangle is a right triangle, so we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find \(z\):
     \[
     y^2 = x^2 + z^2
     \]
   - Given \(y = 14\), substitute into the equation:
     \[
     14^2 = x^2 + z^2
     \]
     \[
     196 = x^2 + z^2
     \]

3. **Analyze the additional information:**
   - The side length \(5\) seems to be part of a separate segment within the larger triangle, but it does not directly help in solving for \(z\) without further context or additional relationships.

4. **Solve for \(z\):**
   - We need to isolate \(z\). Since the problem does not provide \(x\), we cannot solve for \(z\) directly using only the given information about the right triangle.
   - However, we can check the answer choices to see which one fits the form derived from the Pythagorean theorem.

5. **Check the answer choices:**
   - Choice A: \(\sqrt{19}\)
   - Choice B: \(5\)
   - Choice C: \(3\sqrt{19}\)
   - Choice D: \(14\)

Given the form \(z = \sqrt{196 - x^2}\), none of the choices exactly match unless \(x\) is zero, which is not the case here. The closest plausible value is when \(z\) is a simplified form that fits the derived expression.

Since the problem does not provide enough information to determine \(x\) precisely, we must consider the closest possible value that fits the derived expression.
