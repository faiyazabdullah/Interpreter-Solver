<think>
Let's start by analyzing the given information in the image:

1. We have a circle with a central angle ∠BAD = 85°.
2. Another central angle ∠CAD = 150°.
3. We need to find the measure of angle ∠x at point E.

To solve for ∠x, we can use the fact that the sum of angles around a point is 360°.

First, let's calculate the measure of arc CD:
- The total measure of arc AB (which includes arc CD) can be found by subtracting the measures of arcs AD and BC from 360°.
- Arc AD corresponds to the central angle ∠BAD = 85°.
- Arc BC corresponds to the central angle ∠CAD = 150°.

So, the measure of arc CD is:
\[ 360° - 85° - 150° = 125° \]

Since ∠x is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc CD, the measure of ∠x is half the measure of arc CD:
\[ ∠x = \frac{125°}{2} = 62.5° \]

However, none of the given answer choices matches 62.5°. Let's re-evaluate the problem considering possible misinterpretation or error in the problem setup. Given the choices, it seems there might be a simpler relationship or a different interpretation.

Upon closer inspection, the problem might be asking for the supplementary angle to the given angles, which would be:
\[ 180° - 85° = 95° \]
and
\[ 180° - 150° = 30° \]

But these do not align with the given choices either. It appears there might be a misunderstanding or a simpler interpretation needed. Given the closest match to the provided choices, let's consider the supplementary angles again.

Considering the supplementary angles more closely:
If we take the supplementary angle to the 85° angle, it would be:
\[ 180° - 85° = 95° \]

And if we consider the supplementary angle to the 150° angle, it would be:
\[ 180° - 150° = 30° \]

Given the choices, the closest supplementary angle to these calculations is:
\[ 35° \]

Thus, the closest answer choice is:
Final Answer: B
