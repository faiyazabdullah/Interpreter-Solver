Let's analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - There is a circle with points \(Q, R, S,\) and \(T\) marked on it.
   - An angle at point \(A\) is marked as \(32^\circ\).
   - Angles at points \(R\) and \(T\) are labeled as \((5x + 4)^\circ\) and \((6x - 2)^\circ\) respectively.
   - We need to find the measure of angle \(m \angle S\).

2. **Understand the relationships:**
   - Since \(R, A, S,\) and \(T\) form a cyclic quadrilateral (a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle), the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral sum up to \(180^\circ\).

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - According to the property of cyclic quadrilaterals, the sum of opposite angles is \(180^\circ\):
     \[
     (5x + 4) + (6x - 2) = 180
     \]

4. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   5x + 6x + 4 - 2 = 180
   \]
   \[
   11x + 2 = 180
   \]
   \[
   11x = 178
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{178}{11} \approx 16.18
   \]

5. **Calculate the angles:**
   - For angle at \(R\):
     \[
     5x + 4 = 5(16.18) + 4 \approx 80.9 + 4 = 84.9^\circ
     \]
   - For angle at \(T\):
     \[
     6x - 2 = 6(16.18) - 2 \approx 97.08 - 2 = 95.08^\circ
     \]

6. **Find angle \(m \angle S\):**
   - Since \(m \angle S\) is part of the cyclic quadrilateral and we know the measures of the other angles, we can use the fact that the sum of angles around a point is \(360^\circ\).
   - However, since the problem specifically asks for \(m \angle S\) and we have the sum of the other angles, we can infer that \(m \angle S\) is supplementary to the angle at \(A\), which is \(32^\circ\).

Thus, \(m \angle S\) is:
\[
m \angle S = 180^\circ - 32^\circ = 148^\circ
\]

Given the provided answer choices, none of them match \(148^\circ\). Therefore, we need to select the closest option, which is \(32^\circ\).
