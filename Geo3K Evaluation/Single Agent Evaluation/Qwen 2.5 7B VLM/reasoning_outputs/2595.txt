To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify Given Information:**
   - Diameter of \(\odot S\) is 30 units.
   - Diameter of \(\odot R\) is 20 units.
   - \(DS = 9\) units.
   - We need to find \(RC\).

2. **Understand the Geometry:**
   - \(\odot S\) has a radius of \(15\) units (since diameter is \(30\)).
   - \(\odot R\) has a radius of \(10\) units (since diameter is \(20\)).
   - \(D\) is a point on the circumference of \(\odot S\).
   - \(S\) is the center of \(\odot S\).
   - \(R\) is the center of \(\odot R\).

3. **Analyze the Right Triangle:**
   - Consider triangle \(SRC\) where \(S\) is the center of \(\odot S\), \(R\) is the center of \(\odot R\), and \(C\) is a point on \(\odot R\).
   - Since \(RS\) is the distance between the centers of the two circles, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \(SRC\).

4. **Calculate \(RS\):**
   - \(RS = RS = DS + SR = 9 + 10 = 19\) units.

5. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   - In triangle \(SRC\), \(RS^2 = RC^2 + SC^2\).
   - Here, \(SC = 15\) units (radius of \(\odot S\)).
   - Therefore, \(19^2 = RC^2 + 15^2\).
   - Simplifying, \(361 = RC^2 + 225\).
   - Solving for \(RC^2\), \(RC^2 = 361 - 225 = 136\).
   - Thus, \(RC = \sqrt{136} \approx 11.66\).

Since the calculated value does not match any of the given answer choices exactly, we need to determine the closest option. The closest value to \(11.66\) is \(12\).
