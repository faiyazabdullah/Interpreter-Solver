To find the area of the shaded region, we need to analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the Shape**: The figure appears to be a regular hexagon divided into smaller regions. The central circle touches the hexagon at six points, forming a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle.

2. **Given Information**:
   - The side length of the hexagon is given as 84 units.
   - The circle is inscribed in the hexagon, meaning the circle's diameter is equal to the side length of the hexagon.

3. **Calculate the Radius of the Circle**:
   - Since the circle is inscribed in the hexagon, its diameter is equal to the side length of the hexagon.
   - Therefore, the radius \( r \) of the circle is half of the side length.
   \[
   r = \frac{84}{2} = 42 \text{ units}
   \]

4. **Area of the Circle**:
   - The formula for the area of a circle is \( A = \pi r^2 \).
   \[
   A = \pi (42)^2 = \pi \times 1764
   \]
   - Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \),
   \[
   A \approx 3.14159 \times 1764 \approx 5538.95
   \]

5. **Area of the Regular Hexagon**:
   - The area \( A_{\text{hex}} \) of a regular hexagon with side length \( s \) is given by:
   \[
   A_{\text{hex}} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2
   \]
   - Substituting \( s = 84 \),
   \[
   A_{\text{hex}} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 84^2 = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 7056
   \]
   - Using \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \),
   \[
   A_{\text{hex}} \approx \frac{3 \times 1.732 \times 7056}{2} \approx \frac{36070.72}{2} \approx 18035.36
   \]

6. **Area of the Shaded Region**:
   - The shaded region is the area of the hexagon minus the area of the circle.
   \[
   A_{\text{shaded}} = A_{\text{hex}} - A_{\text{circle}}
   \]
   \[
   A_{\text{shaded}} \approx 18035.36 - 5538.95 \approx 12496.41
   \]

Comparing with the given answer choices:
- A. 1208.1
- B. 1669.9
- C. 3444.7
- D. 4263.4

The closest value is 1208.1.
