First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric relationships in the image:

1. We have a right triangle (triangle ABC) with a smaller triangle (ADE) inscribed within it.
2. The larger triangle has vertices at A, B, and C.
3. The smaller triangle has vertices at A, D, and E.
4. The height of the larger triangle is 18 units.
5. The height of the smaller triangle is 8 units.
6. The hypotenuse of the larger triangle is 10 units.
7. We need to find the length of side AC, which we'll call x.

To solve for x, we can use the concept of similar triangles. Since triangle ADE is similar to triangle ABC, their corresponding sides are proportional. Therefore, the ratio of the heights will be equal to the ratio of the lengths of the bases.

Let's set up the proportion:

\[
\frac{\text{height of smaller triangle}}{\text{height of larger triangle}} = \frac{\text{base of smaller triangle}}{\text{base of larger triangle}}
\]

Substitute the known values:

\[
\frac{8}{18} = \frac{x}{x + 10}
\]

Simplify the fraction on the left side:

\[
\frac{4}{9} = \frac{x}{x + 10}
\]

Cross-multiply to solve for x:

\[
4(x + 10) = 9x
\]

Expand and simplify:

\[
4x + 40 = 9x
\]

Subtract 4x from both sides:

\[
40 = 5x
\]

Divide both sides by 5:

\[
x = 8
\]

However, this value does not match any of the provided answer choices. Let's re-evaluate the problem using another approach.

We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the base of the larger triangle, which is BC. Since the height of the larger triangle is 18 and the hypotenuse is 10, we can find the base (BC) using the Pythagorean theorem:

\[
BC^2 + 18^2 = 10^2
\]

\[
BC^2 + 324 = 100
\]

\[
BC^2 = 100 - 324
\]

This calculation seems incorrect because the base cannot be negative. Let's re-evaluate the problem using the similarity ratio again.

Since the ratio of the heights is 8/18, the base of the smaller triangle will be scaled accordingly. However, we need to find the length of AC directly.

Given the options, let's check the closest value:
