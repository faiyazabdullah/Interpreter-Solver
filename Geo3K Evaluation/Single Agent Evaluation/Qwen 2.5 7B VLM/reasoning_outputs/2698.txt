<think>
First, let's analyze the given geometric figure:

1. We have a circle with points T, W, and Y marked on it.
2. The line segments TW and TY are given as \(4x\) and \(2x + 10\), respectively.
3. The problem states that \(WTY \cong TWY\).

Since \(WTY \cong TWY\), the lengths of the corresponding sides must be equal. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[4x = 2x + 10\]

Now, let's solve for \(x\):
\[4x - 2x = 10\]
\[2x = 10\]
\[x = 5\]

Finally, let's compare our calculated result with the given answer choices:
A. 2
B. 4
C. 5
D. 10

The calculated value of \(x\) is 5, which matches option C.
