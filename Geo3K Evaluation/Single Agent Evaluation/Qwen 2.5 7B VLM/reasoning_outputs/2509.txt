QUESTION:
In the figure, m \angle 1 = 123. Find the measure of \angle 14.

CHOICES:
A. 47
B. 57
C. 67
D. 123

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
<think> Let's analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify Given Information**: We know that \( m\angle 1 = 123^\circ \).

2. **Understand the Relationships**: 
   - Angles 1 and 14 appear to be vertically opposite angles because they are formed by the intersection of two lines at point A.
   - Vertically opposite angles are always equal.

3. **Apply Geometric Properties**:
   - Since angles 1 and 14 are vertically opposite angles, their measures are equal.

4. **Calculate the Measure of Angle 14**:
   - Since \( m\angle 1 = 123^\circ \), it follows that \( m\angle 14 = 123^\circ \).

5. **Compare with Answer Choices**:
   - The calculated measure of angle 14 matches exactly with the given answer choice D.

Based on the geometric property of vertically opposite angles, we can conclude that the measure of angle 14 is 123 degrees.

Final Answer: D
