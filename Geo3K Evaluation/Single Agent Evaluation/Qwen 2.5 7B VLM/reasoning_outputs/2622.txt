<think> Let's start by analyzing the given information and the geometric relationships in the image:

1. **Identify Similar Figures**: The problem states that we have a pair of similar figures. This means their corresponding sides are proportional, and their areas are proportional to the squares of their corresponding sides.

2. **Given Information**:
   - The large figure (blue) has an area \( A = 36 \text{ yd}^2 \).
   - The side length of the small figure (green) is given as 4 yd.

3. **Calculate the Side Length Ratio**: Since the figures are similar, the ratio of their corresponding sides is the same. We need to find the ratio between the side lengths of the blue figure and the green figure.

4. **Determine the Ratio of Areas**: The ratio of the areas of two similar figures is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. 

5. **Calculate the Area of the Green Figure**:
   - Let the side length of the blue figure be \( s_b \).
   - Let the side length of the green figure be \( s_g = 4 \text{ yd} \).
   - The ratio of the side lengths is \( \frac{s_b}{s_g} \).

Since the blue figure is not explicitly given a side length, but its area is known, we can use the relationship between the areas directly:
\[ \left( \frac{s_b}{s_g} \right)^2 = \frac{\text{Area of Blue}}{\text{Area of Green}} \]

6. **Substitute Known Values**:
\[ \left( \frac{s_b}{4} \right)^2 = \frac{36}{\text{Area of Green}} \]

7. **Solve for the Area of the Green Figure**:
\[ \left( \frac{s_b}{4} \right)^2 = \frac{36}{\text{Area of Green}} \]
\[ \left( \frac{s_b}{4} \right)^2 = \frac{36}{x} \]
Where \( x \) is the area of the green figure.

From the problem, we know:
\[ \left( \frac{s_b}{4} \right)^2 = \frac{36}{x} \]
Since the ratio of the areas is squared, we can solve for \( x \):
\[ \frac{s_b}{4} = \sqrt{\frac{36}{x}} \]
\[ \left( \frac{s_b}{4} \right)^2 = \frac{36}{x} \]
\[ \frac{36}{x} = \frac{36}{x} \]
Thus, solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \left( \frac{s_b}{4} \right)^2 \cdot 36 \]
\[ x = 9 \]

Therefore, the area of the green figure is \( 9 \text{ yd}^2 \).
