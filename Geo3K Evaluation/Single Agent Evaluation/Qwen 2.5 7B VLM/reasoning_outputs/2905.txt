To find \( y \), we need to analyze the given geometric figure. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Identify the given information**:
   - There is a circle with points \( M, B, C \) lying on it.
   - Point \( A \) is outside the circle, connected to point \( M \).
   - The length of segment \( MA = 10 \).
   - The length of segment \( BC = 6 \).
   - We need to find the length of segment \( MB \).

2. **Understand the relationships**:
   - Since \( M, B, C \) are on the circle, they form a triangle with the center of the circle. However, we don't have enough information about the circle's radius or the center to directly use the properties of the circle here.
   - Instead, we can use the fact that \( MA \) intersects the circle at point \( B \). This suggests that we might use the power of a point theorem.

3. **Apply the Power of a Point Theorem**:
   - The Power of a Point theorem states that for a point \( P \) outside a circle, if a secant line from \( P \) intersects the circle at points \( A \) and \( B \), then \( PA \cdot PB = PC^2 \).

However, there seems to be a misunderstanding because the problem does not involve a point outside the circle intersecting it. Instead, we need to recognize that \( MB \) is part of the same line segment \( MA \).

Since \( MB \) is the remaining part of \( MA \) after subtracting \( AB \), and since \( AB \) is the length of the chord \( BC \) which is given as 6, we can infer that \( MB = MA - AB \).

Given \( MA = 10 \) and \( AB = BC = 6 \), we can calculate:
\[ MB = MA - AB = 10 - 6 = 4 \]

But this contradicts the given choices. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Upon closer inspection, the problem might be referring to the length of the segment \( MB \) being part of the diameter or some other specific relationship. Given the choices, the most plausible value that fits the context of the problem is:
