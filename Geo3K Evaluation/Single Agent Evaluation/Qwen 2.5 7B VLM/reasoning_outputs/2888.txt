Let's analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the shapes and their properties:**
   - The figure contains triangles and parallel lines.
   - Triangle EFG and triangle ABC have specific side lengths given: EF = 12, FG = 12, and BC = 15.

2. **Understand the relationship between the triangles:**
   - Triangles EFG and ABC are similar because they share corresponding angles and the sides are proportional.

3. **Use the properties of similar triangles:**
   - If two triangles are similar, the ratios of their corresponding sides are equal.
   - Therefore, the ratio of the sides of triangle EFG to triangle ABC can be used to find x.

4. **Set up the proportion:**
   - The ratio of the sides of triangle EFG to triangle ABC is \(\frac{EF}{BC} = \frac{FG}{x}\).

5. **Substitute the known values:**
   - \(\frac{12}{15} = \frac{12}{x}\).

6. **Solve for x:**
   - Cross-multiply to solve for x: \(12x = 12 \times 15\).
   - Simplify: \(12x = 180\).
   - Divide both sides by 12: \(x = 15\).

7. **Verify the solution:**
   - The value of x is indeed 15, which matches the given answer choice D.
