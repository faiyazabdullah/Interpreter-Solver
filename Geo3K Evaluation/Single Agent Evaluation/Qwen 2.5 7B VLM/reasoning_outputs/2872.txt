<thought>
1. The image shows a circle with points A, B, C, and D marked on it. The angle at the center of the circle, formed by the radii to points B and C, is labeled as 218°.
2. We need to find the measure of m ∠1, which is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc BC.
3. According to the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
4. Therefore, m ∠1 = 1/2 * m arc BC.
5. Since the total measure of the circle is 360°, the measure of arc BC can be found by subtracting the central angle from 360°: m arc BC = 360° - 218° = 142°.
6. Now, applying the Inscribed Angle Theorem: m ∠1 = 1/2 * 142° = 71°.
7. Comparing our calculated result (71°) with the given answer choices, none of them match exactly. However, we must select the closest option available.
8. The closest option to 71° among the given choices is 70°, which is not listed. The next closest is 90°.

<solution>
Based on the analysis, the closest option to 71° is 90°. Therefore, the best answer choice is:

Final Answer: B
