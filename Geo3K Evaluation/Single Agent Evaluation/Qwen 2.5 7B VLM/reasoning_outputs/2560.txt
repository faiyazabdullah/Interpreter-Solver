<think>
Let's analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the given information**: The image shows a circle with points R, S, T, U, and V marked on it. The distances RV, RT, and TU are labeled as 4 units each.
   
2. **Understand the relationships**: Since RV = RT = TU = 4, triangle RVT is an isosceles triangle with base VT and equal sides RV and RT.
   
3. **Determine the midpoint**: Point V is the midpoint of chord RT because RV = RT. Therefore, V divides RT into two equal segments of 4 units each.

4. **Find the length of VT**: Since V is the midpoint of RT, VT = RT/2 = 4/2 = 2.

5. **Identify point X**: Point X is also on the circle, but its specific relationship to the circle isn't clear without additional information. However, since we need to find x, which seems to be a variable related to the circle, let's assume X is a point on the circle such that VX = x.

6. **Calculate x**: If VX = x and V is the midpoint of RT, then VX would typically be half of RT, which is 2. But since we need to find x, and considering the symmetry and the fact that VX is a segment of the circle, we can infer that x should be the same as the distance from V to X along the circle.

Given the symmetry and the distances involved, x appears to be 2.

<solution>
Based on the analysis, the value of x is 2.
