To determine the value of \(x\) such that \(a \parallel b\), we need to use the property that corresponding angles formed by a transversal intersecting two parallel lines are equal. In this case, the angles at points B and A are corresponding angles.

Given:
- Angle at B = \(4x + 11^\circ\)
- Angle at A = \(8x + 1^\circ\)

Since \(a \parallel b\), the corresponding angles must be equal:
\[4x + 11 = 8x + 1\]

Now, let's solve for \(x\):

1. Subtract \(4x\) from both sides:
\[11 = 4x + 1\]

2. Subtract 1 from both sides:
\[10 = 4x\]

3. Divide both sides by 4:
\[x = \frac{10}{4} = 2.5\]

After calculating, we find that \(x = 2.5\).

Let's check the answer choices:
A. 2.5
B. 14
C. 15
D. 16

The closest match to our calculated value is 2.5.

Final Answer: A
