To solve for \( M S \), we need to analyze the geometric relationships and given measurements in the triangle. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \( M C = 7 \)
   - \( R M = 4 \)
   - \( A T = 16 \)

2. **Understand the geometric figure:**
   - The figure appears to be a triangle with point \( M \) as a common vertex for multiple segments.
   - The segments seem to be related to the triangle's medians, altitudes, or some specific line segments within the triangle.

3. **Analyze the relationships:**
   - Since \( M \) is a point within the triangle, it could be the centroid (intersection of medians) or another significant point.
   - The distances \( R M = 4 \) and \( A T = 16 \) suggest these might be segment lengths within the triangle, possibly involving medians or other specific line segments.

4. **Apply the appropriate theorem:**
   - If \( M \) is the centroid, then the median divides the opposite side into a ratio of 2:1.
   - However, the given distances do not directly correspond to typical median lengths without further context.

5. **Assess the closest reasonable value:**
   - Given the distances, let's consider the simplest case where \( M \) could be a midpoint or a specific point within the triangle.
   - If we assume \( M \) is a midpoint or a specific point creating a simple proportional relationship, we can test the values.

6. **Calculate \( M S \):**
   - Since \( R M = 4 \) and \( M C = 7 \), and considering the triangle's properties, if \( M \) is a midpoint, then \( M S \) would likely be a proportionate value.
   - By simple arithmetic and proportional reasoning, the closest value to fit the given distances is 3.5.

Based on the analysis, the closest reasonable value for \( M S \) is 3.5.
