Let's analyze the image step by step:

1. **Identify the shapes and angles**:
   - The figure contains triangles and a straight line.
   - The triangle at the left has angles labeled as 78° and 50°.
   - The angle at the top of the figure (angle 1) is 120°.
   - Angle 2 is part of the same straight line as angle 1.
   - Angle 3 is part of the triangle at the right.

2. **Calculate the third angle in the triangle on the left**:
   - The sum of angles in a triangle is 180°.
   - The third angle in the triangle on the left can be calculated as:
     \[
     180° - 78° - 50° = 52°
     \]
   - Therefore, angle 2 is 52°.

3. **Identify angle 3**:
   - Angle 3 is part of the triangle on the right.
   - We need to find the third angle in this triangle.
   - The sum of angles in a triangle is 180°.
   - The known angles are 56° and 52°.
   - Calculate angle 3:
     \[
     180° - 56° - 52° = 72°
     \]

Since 72° does not match any of the given choices, we need to re-evaluate the problem.

Upon re-evaluating, it seems there might be a misunderstanding. Let's consider the straight line and the angles formed.

4. **Re-evaluate the straight line**:
   - Angle 1 is 120°.
   - Angle 2 is supplementary to angle 1.
   - Therefore, angle 2 is:
     \[
     180° - 120° = 60°
     \]

5. **Identify angle 3 again**:
   - Angle 3 is part of the triangle on the right.
   - The known angles are 56° and 60°.
   - Calculate angle 3:
     \[
     180° - 56° - 60° = 64°
     \]

Since 64° still does not match any of the given choices, let's consider the closest match.

Given the choices:
A. 52
B. 56
C. 60
D. 68

The closest match is 60°.
