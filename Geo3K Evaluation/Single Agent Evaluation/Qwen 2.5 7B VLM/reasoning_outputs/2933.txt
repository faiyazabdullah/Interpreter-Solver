First, let's analyze the given geometric figure:

1. We have a point \( B \) at the center of the figure.
2. There are several rays emanating from point \( B \): \( BA, BC, BD, BE, BF, BG \).
3. We know the measure of angle \( \angle CBF = 37^\circ \).
4. We need to find the measure of angle \( \angle 1 \).

Next, we'll consider the properties of angles formed by intersecting lines:

5. Since point \( B \) is the center, the angles subtended by the same arc are equal.
6. The angles around point \( B \) form a full circle, which is \( 360^\circ \).

Now, let's focus on angle \( \angle 1 \):

7. Angle \( \angle 1 \) is part of the straight line \( BD \), which means it forms a straight angle with another angle on the same ray.
8. The straight angle measures \( 180^\circ \).

Given that angle \( \angle CBF = 37^\circ \) is adjacent to angle \( \angle 1 \), we can deduce:

9. If we consider the straight angle \( 180^\circ \), then angle \( \angle 1 \) plus angle \( \angle CBF \) together make up the straight angle.

Therefore, we can calculate angle \( \angle 1 \):

\[ \angle 1 = 180^\circ - \angle CBF \]

Substitute the known value:

\[ \angle 1 = 180^\circ - 37^\circ \]
\[ \angle 1 = 143^\circ \]

However, the closest option provided does not match our calculated result directly. Given the constraints and possible rounding or simplification in the problem setup, we need to re-evaluate the closest matching angle among the given choices.

Given the closest match in the provided options, we should select the closest value.

The closest match to \( 143^\circ \) among the provided choices is:
