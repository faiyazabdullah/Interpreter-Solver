<think>
Let's analyze the geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \( DB = 24 \)
   - \( AE = 3 \)
   - \( EC = 18 \)

2. **Understand the relationship between points:**
   - \( A, D, E, \) and \( C \) form part of the triangle \( ABC \).
   - \( D \) and \( E \) appear to lie on segments \( AB \) and \( AC \), respectively.

3. **Determine the total length of \( AC \):**
   - Since \( AE = 3 \) and \( EC = 18 \), the total length of \( AC \) is:
     \[
     AC = AE + EC = 3 + 18 = 21
     \]

4. **Use the given lengths to find \( AD \):**
   - We need to find the length of \( AD \). Given that \( D \) lies on \( AB \), we can use the fact that \( AD \) is a segment of \( AB \).

5. **Calculate \( AD \):**
   - Since \( DB = 24 \) and \( AB \) is the sum of \( AD \) and \( DB \):
     \[
     AB = AD + DB
     \]
   - Let \( AD = x \). Then:
     \[
     AB = x + 24
     \]
   - Also, since \( AD \) and \( AE \) are parts of \( AB \), we can express \( AD \) in terms of the total length of \( AC \) and the known lengths:
     \[
     AD = AC - AE = 21 - 3 = 18
     \]

Thus, the length of \( AD \) is 18.
