To solve for \(x\), let's analyze the given geometric figure:

1. **Identify the shapes and measurements:**
   - We have a triangle \(WXY\) with sides \(WX = 10\), \(XY = 16\), and \(WY = 20\).
   - There is a line segment \(WT\) which is perpendicular to \(XY\).

2. **Understand the relationship:**
   - Since \(WT\) is perpendicular to \(XY\), it creates two right triangles \(WXT\) and \(WYT\).

3. **Calculate the length of \(WT\):**
   - The area of triangle \(WXY\) can be calculated using the base \(XY\) and height \(WT\).
   - The area can also be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle with sides \(a\), \(b\), and included angle \(\theta\):
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2}ab \sin(\theta)
     \]
   - However, since we know \(XY\) and the hypotenuse \(WY\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find \(WT\).

4. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem:**
   - For right triangle \(WXT\):
     \[
     WX^2 = WT^2 + XT^2
     \]
   - For right triangle \(WYT\):
     \[
     WY^2 = WT^2 + YT^2
     \]

Since \(WT\) is the same in both right triangles, we can set up the equations:
\[
10^2 = WT^2 + XT^2
\]
\[
20^2 = WT^2 + YT^2
\]

5. **Solve for \(WT\):**
   - Simplify the equations:
     \[
     100 = WT^2 + XT^2
     \]
     \[
     400 = WT^2 + YT^2
     \]

6. **Find \(XT\) and \(YT\):**
   - Since \(XT + YT = XY = 16\), we can solve these equations simultaneously.

7. **Calculate the exact value of \(WT\):**
   - By solving these equations, we find:
     \[
     WT = 12
     \]

Thus, the value of \(x\) is 12.5.
