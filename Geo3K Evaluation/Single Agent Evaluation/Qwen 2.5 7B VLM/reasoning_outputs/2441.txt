<think>
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the geometric relationships in the given figure. Here are the steps:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \( m\angle 3 = 110^\circ \)
   - \( m\angle 12 = 55^\circ \)

2. **Understand the relationships:**
   - Angles 3 and 12 appear to be part of a larger configuration involving parallel lines and transversals. However, the specific relationship between these angles isn't immediately clear without more context.

3. **Analyze the angle measures:**
   - Since \( m\angle 3 = 110^\circ \) and \( m\angle 12 = 55^\circ \), we need to determine how these angles relate to each other and to angle 1.

4. **Consider possible relationships:**
   - If angle 3 and angle 12 are on the same side of the transversal but on opposite sides of the intersecting line, they might be supplementary angles (sum up to 180 degrees).
   - However, since they are not directly adjacent, we need to look at the overall configuration to find a consistent relationship.

5. **Check for supplementary angles:**
   - Supplementary angles add up to 180 degrees. But \( 110^\circ + 55^\circ = 165^\circ \), which is not supplementary.
   - We need to consider if there is another angle involved that would make them supplementary.

6. **Re-evaluate the configuration:**
   - Given the lack of direct supplementary relationship, we should check the surrounding angles for any indirect relationships.
   - Angle 1 could be related to angle 3 and/or angle 12 through a transversal or other geometric property.

7. **Determine angle 1:**
   - If angle 1 is part of the same configuration as angle 3 and angle 12, we need to find a way to combine these angles.
   - One possible approach is to use the fact that the sum of angles around a point is always 360 degrees, but this isn't straightforward here.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - After re-evaluating the relationships and the given angles, it appears that angle 1 is likely related to the sum of 110 degrees and 55 degrees, but considering the geometric properties, the most reasonable answer is the closest option.
