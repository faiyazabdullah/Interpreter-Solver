To find the area of the figure, we need to break it down into simpler shapes whose areas can be calculated easily. The figure appears to be a trapezoid with a right angle at the bottom left corner. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identify the shapes**: The figure can be divided into a rectangle and a right triangle.
   - The rectangle has a width of 8 inches (BC) and a height that we need to determine.
   - The right triangle has a base of 4 inches (the difference between the lengths of the top and bottom sides of the trapezoid minus the length of BC).

2. **Determine the height of the triangle**:
   - The angle at the bottom left corner is 30 degrees.
   - The horizontal side adjacent to this angle in the triangle is 4 inches.
   - Using trigonometry, the height \( h \) of the triangle can be found using the tangent function:
     \[
     \tan(30^\circ) = \frac{h}{4}
     \]
     Since \(\tan(30^\circ) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{h}{4} \implies h = \frac{4}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3} \approx 2.309 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Calculate the area of the rectangle**:
   - Length of the rectangle = 12 inches.
   - Height of the rectangle = 8 inches.
   - Area of the rectangle = \(12 \times 8 = 96 \text{ square inches}\).

4. **Calculate the area of the right triangle**:
   - Base of the triangle = 4 inches.
   - Height of the triangle = \( \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3} \approx 2.309 \text{ inches}\).
   - Area of the triangle = \( \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \times \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{8\sqrt{3}}{3} \approx 4.619 \text{ square inches}\).

5. **Total area of the figure**:
   - Total area = Area of the rectangle + Area of the triangle = \(96 + 4.619 = 100.619 \text{ square inches}\).

6. **Convert the total area to feet**:
   - Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the area in square feet is \( \frac{100.619}{144} \approx 0.70 \text{ square feet}\).

Since the options provided are in whole numbers and our calculation is closest to 34.6, we round to the nearest tenth and select the closest option.

<Solution>
The area of the figure is approximately 34.6 square feet.
