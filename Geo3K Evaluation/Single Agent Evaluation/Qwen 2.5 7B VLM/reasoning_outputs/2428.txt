To solve this problem, let's analyze the given image step by step:

1. **Identify the type of polygon**: The image shows a regular polygon inscribed in a circle. Regular polygons have all sides and angles equal.

2. **Understand the properties of a regular polygon inscribed in a circle**: For a regular polygon inscribed in a circle, the central angle subtended by each side of the polygon is the same.

3. **Calculate the measure of the central angle**:
   - A full circle is \(360^\circ\).
   - If there are \(n\) sides in the polygon, then the measure of each central angle is \(\frac{360^\circ}{n}\).

4. **Determine the number of sides \(n\)**: From the image, we can see that the polygon has 6 sides (a hexagon).

5. **Calculate the central angle**:
   \[
   \text{Central angle} = \frac{360^\circ}{6} = 60^\circ
   \]

Now, let's compare our calculated result with the given answer choices:

- A. 30
- B. 60
- C. 90
- D. 120

The calculated central angle is \(60^\circ\), which matches choice B.

Final Answer: B
