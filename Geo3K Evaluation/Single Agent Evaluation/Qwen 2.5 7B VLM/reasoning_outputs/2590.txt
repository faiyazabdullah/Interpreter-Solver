<think>
Let's analyze the geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify Given Information**:
   - \( GH = 9 \)
   - \( GK = 6 \)
   - \( KJ = 4 \)

2. **Understand the Relationships**:
   - The figure appears to show a triangle \( GKH \) with segments \( GH \), \( GK \), and \( KH \).
   - Segment \( KJ \) is perpendicular to segment \( GH \).

3. **Apply Geometric Properties**:
   - Since \( KJ \) is perpendicular to \( GH \), we can use the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle \( GKH \).

4. **Calculate \( GH \)**:
   - We need to find the length of \( GI \). However, the problem does not specify that \( I \) lies on \( GH \). Instead, it seems that \( I \) is another point related to \( G \), but we don't have enough information to directly calculate \( GI \) without more context or additional information about the position of \( I \).

5. **Check the Given Choices**:
   - The choices provided are A (6), B (9), C (12), and D (15).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the given information, there is not enough data to determine the exact length of \( GI \). However, the closest value to the lengths provided is 12.

Given the choices, the closest value is 12.

Based on the closest value provided in the choices, the answer is:
