First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric relationships in the figure:

1. We have a rhombus ABCD. A rhombus has all sides of equal length and opposite angles are equal.
2. AC is a diagonal of the rhombus.
3. Angle CDE is given as 116 degrees.
4. We need to find the measure of angle ACD.

Given that AB = BC = CD = DA (all sides of a rhombus are equal), triangle ABC is isosceles with base AD. Since AC is a diagonal, it bisects the angles at A and C. Therefore, angle ACD will be half of angle BCD.

Since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we can use the fact that the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. Hence, angle ACD will be related to the given angle CDE.

Considering the properties of the rhombus and the given angle CDE:
- Angle CDE is the exterior angle to the interior angle BCD.
- The interior angle BCD is supplementary to angle CDE, meaning angle BCD = 180 - 116 = 64 degrees.
- Since AC bisects angle BCD, angle ACD = 64 / 2 = 32 degrees.

However, we need to re-evaluate since angle ACD should be part of the rhombus properties:
- Given the properties of the rhombus and the bisected angles, angle ACD should actually be the complement of the supplementary angle divided by 2.

Thus, the correct calculation for angle ACD is indeed:
- Angle ACD = 180 - 116 / 2 = 82 degrees, but considering the bisector property, it should be 32 degrees, which does not match the answer choices.

Revisiting the problem, the correct interpretation should be:
- Angle ACD = 180 - 116 / 2 = 82 degrees, but considering the bisector property, it should be 32 degrees, which does not match the answer choices.

Thus, the correct angle ACD should be:
- Angle ACD = 116 / 2 = 58 degrees.
