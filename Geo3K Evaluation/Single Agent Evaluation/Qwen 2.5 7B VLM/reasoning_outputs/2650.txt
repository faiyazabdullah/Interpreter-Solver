<think>
Let's analyze the given geometric figure:

1. The figure appears to be a combination of a triangle and a rectangle.
2. Triangle ABD and rectangle ABCD share the side AB.
3. The length of AB is given as 8.8 units.
4. The lengths of AC and BC are given as 8.5 units each.
5. We need to find the length of CD, which is labeled as \( x \).
6. Since ABCD forms a rectangle, the opposite sides are equal in length.
7. Therefore, the length of CD should be the same as the length of AB.
8. Given that AB = 8.8 units, we can infer that \( x = 8.8 \) units.

However, since \( x = 8.8 \) does not match any of the provided answer choices, we need to re-evaluate the problem considering the options given.

Given the options:
A. 4.61
B. 5.17
C. 6.52
D. 8.46

Since \( x = 8.8 \) is not among the choices, let's consider the possibility that there might be a misinterpretation or error in the problem setup or the options provided.

Upon re-evaluation, it seems the problem might be asking for the length of another segment, possibly CD, which could be derived differently.

Let's assume the problem intends to find the length of a different segment, say \( y \), which would be the height of the rectangle when considering the right triangle ABD.

Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ABD:
\[ AB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2 \]
\[ 8.8^2 = AD^2 + BD^2 \]
\[ 77.44 = AD^2 + BD^2 \]

Since BD is the height of the rectangle and also the hypotenuse of the right triangle, we can solve for BD:
\[ BD = \sqrt{AD^2 + BD^2} \]

However, without additional information about the length of AD, we cannot directly solve for BD.

Given the options provided and the lack of a direct solution, the closest value to the calculated length (8.8) among the choices is 8.46.
