First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric shape:

1. The shape is a parallelogram.
2. The lengths of the sides are given as 12 cm and 13 cm.
3. The height (perpendicular distance between the base and the opposite side) is given as 5 cm.

Since it is a parallelogram, the opposite sides are equal in length. Therefore, we have two pairs of sides:
- Side AD = Side BC = 12 cm
- Side AB = Side CD = 13 cm

Next, we need to find the perimeter of the parallelogram. The perimeter \( P \) of a parallelogram is calculated by adding up the lengths of all its sides:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length of one pair of opposite sides}) + 2 \times (\text{length of the other pair of opposite sides}) \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ P = 2 \times 12 + 2 \times 13 \]
\[ P = 24 + 26 \]
\[ P = 50 \]

Therefore, the perimeter of the parallelogram is 50 cm.

Comparing our calculated result with the given answer choices:
- A. 25
- B. 50
- C. 60
- D. 100

The closest match to our calculated perimeter is 50.

Final Answer: B
