To find \( x \), we need to analyze the given geometric figure. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Identify the given lengths**: 
   - AB = 24
   - BC = 9
   - CE = 12.25

2. **Understand the relationship**: 
   - The figure appears to be a cyclic quadrilateral (a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle).
   - The length \( x \) is the length of side AD.

3. **Apply Ptolemy's theorem**:
   - Ptolemy's theorem states that for a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of the products of the lengths of opposite sides is equal to the product of the lengths of the diagonals.
   - For quadrilateral ABCD, Ptolemy's theorem gives:
     \[
     AC \cdot BD = AB \cdot CD + AD \cdot BC
     \]
   - However, we do not have the length of diagonal \( AC \) or \( BD \). Instead, we can use the fact that the lengths given are part of the same circle and apply the concept of similar triangles or the power of a point theorem indirectly.

4. **Calculate \( x \)**:
   - Since the figure is symmetric and the lengths are given in a way that suggests a specific geometric relationship, we can infer that \( x \) should be the same as the length of the opposite side that is directly proportional to the given lengths.
   - By examining the lengths, it appears that \( x \) should be equal to the length of BC, which is 9.

Given these observations, we conclude that \( x = 9 \).

Solution section:

Since the length of side AD (\( x \)) is the same as the length of side BC, we have:
\[
x = 9
\]
