For the pair of similar figures, use the given areas to find the scale factor from the blue to the green figure.

CHOICES:
A. \frac { 1 } { 4 }
B. \frac { 1 } { 2 }
C. \frac { 2 } { 1 }
D. \frac { 4 } { 1 }

<think> Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The smaller rectangle (blue) has an area of \(8 \text{ in}^2\).
   - The larger rectangle (green) has an area of \(32 \text{ in}^2\).

2. **Understand the relationship between the rectangles:**
   - The rectangles are similar, meaning their corresponding sides are proportional.

3. **Calculate the scale factor:**
   - For similar figures, the ratio of the areas is the square of the ratio of the corresponding side lengths.
   - Let the scale factor be \(k\). Then, the ratio of the areas is \(k^2\).

4. **Set up the equation for the areas:**
   \[
   k^2 = \frac{\text{Area of larger rectangle}}{\text{Area of smaller rectangle}}
   \]
   \[
   k^2 = \frac{32}{8}
   \]

5. **Simplify the fraction:**
   \[
   k^2 = 4
   \]

6. **Solve for \(k\):**
   \[
   k = \sqrt{4} = 2
   \]

7. **Interpret the scale factor:**
   - Since the scale factor is 2, it means each side of the larger rectangle is twice the length of the corresponding side of the smaller rectangle.

8. **Verify the options:**
   - The scale factor is \(2\), which matches option \(C\).
