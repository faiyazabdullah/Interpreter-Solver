First, let's analyze the geometric figure:

1. The figure appears to be a right triangle XYZ with a right angle at Y.
2. We know the lengths of the sides:
   - XY = 5 (the vertical side)
   - XZ = 9 (the horizontal side)
   - YZ is the hypotenuse, which we need to find.
3. To find the measure of âˆ Z, we can use trigonometric functions. Since we have a right triangle and we know the lengths of two sides, we can use the tangent function:
   \[
   \tan(\angle Z) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{XY}{XZ} = \frac{5}{9}
   \]
4. We need to find the angle whose tangent is \(\frac{5}{9}\). Using a calculator:
   \[
   \angle Z = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{5}{9}\right)
   \]
5. Calculate the value:
   \[
   \angle Z \approx \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{5}{9}\right) \approx 33.7^\circ
   \]

Now, let's compare our calculated result with the given answer choices:
- A. 29.1
- B. 33.7
- C. 56.3
- D. 60.9

Our calculated value matches option B.
