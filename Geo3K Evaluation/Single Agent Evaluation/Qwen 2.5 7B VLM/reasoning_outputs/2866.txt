To solve for the measure of ∠13, we need to analyze the geometric relationships within the figure. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify Known Angles**:
   - We know that m∠3 = 110°.
   - We also know that m∠12 = 55°.

2. **Analyze the Geometry**:
   - The figure appears to involve parallel lines cut by a transversal.
   - ∠12 and ∠13 are likely corresponding angles since they appear to be on the same side of the transversal but on different parallel lines.

3. **Use Corresponding Angles**:
   - Corresponding angles are equal when lines are parallel. Therefore, ∠12 = ∠13.

4. **Calculate ∠13**:
   - Since m∠12 = 55°, it follows that m∠13 = 55°.

Given these steps, we conclude that the measure of ∠13 is 55°.

Solution:

Since ∠12 and ∠13 are corresponding angles and they are equal (m∠12 = 55°), the measure of ∠13 is 55°.
