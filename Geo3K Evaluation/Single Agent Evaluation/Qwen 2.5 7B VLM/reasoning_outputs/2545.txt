To find the area of the shaded region, we need to analyze the given geometric figure. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identify the shapes**: The figure consists of a large semicircle and three smaller semicircles inside it. The diameter of the large semicircle is equal to the sum of the diameters of the three smaller semicircles, which is 15 units.

2. **Calculate the radius of the large semicircle**: Since the diameter of the large semicircle is 15, the radius \( R \) is half of that:
   \[
   R = \frac{15}{2} = 7.5
   \]

3. **Calculate the area of the large semicircle**:
   \[
   \text{Area of large semicircle} = \frac{1}{2} \pi R^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (7.5)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (56.25) = 28.125 \pi
   \]

4. **Calculate the radius of each smaller semicircle**: Since the total diameter of the three smaller semicircles is 15, the radius \( r \) of each smaller semicircle is:
   \[
   r = \frac{15}{3} = 5
   \]

5. **Calculate the area of one smaller semicircle**:
   \[
   \text{Area of one smaller semicircle} = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (5)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (25) = 12.5 \pi
   \]

6. **Calculate the total area of the three smaller semicircles**:
   \[
   \text{Total area of three smaller semicircles} = 3 \times 12.5 \pi = 37.5 \pi
   \]

7. **Calculate the area of the shaded region**: Subtract the total area of the three smaller semicircles from the area of the large semicircle:
   \[
   \text{Area of shaded region} = 28.125 \pi - 37.5 \pi = 10.625 \pi
   \]

8. **Convert the area to a numerical value**:
   \[
   10.625 \pi \approx 10.625 \times 3.14159 = 33.306
   \]

9. **Round to the nearest tenth**:
   \[
   33.306 \approx 33.3
   \]

Since the problem asks for the closest answer among the provided choices, the closest value to 33.3 is 29.5.
