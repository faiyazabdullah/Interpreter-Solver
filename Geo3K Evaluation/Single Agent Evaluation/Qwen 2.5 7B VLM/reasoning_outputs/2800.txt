To find the area of the parallelogram, we need to use the formula for the area of a parallelogram, which is base times height. From the image, we can see:

- The base of the parallelogram is the sum of the two segments forming the bottom side: \(27 \text{ in.} + 40 \text{ in.} = 67 \text{ in.}\).
- The height of the parallelogram is given as \(36 \text{ in.}\).

Now, we can calculate the area:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{base} \times \text{height} = 67 \text{ in.} \times 36 \text{ in.} \]

Let's perform the multiplication:
\[ 67 \times 36 = 2412 \]

Since the problem asks us to round to the nearest tenth, but our calculation is already a whole number, we don't need to round it.

Comparing our result with the answer choices:
- A. 972
- B. 1080
- C. 1440
- D. 2412

Our calculated area matches option D.
