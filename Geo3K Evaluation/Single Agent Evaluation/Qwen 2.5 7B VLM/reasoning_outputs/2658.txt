To solve for \( x \) in the given geometric figure, we need to analyze the relationships between the segments and the circle. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Segment \( EF = 12 \)
   - Segment \( EG = 16 \)
   - \( F \) and \( G \) are points on the circle.
   - \( E \) is outside the circle.
   - \( FG \) is a tangent segment from point \( E \).

2. **Understand the geometric properties:**
   - Since \( FG \) is a tangent segment from point \( E \), it forms a right angle with the radius at the point of tangency, say \( G \). Therefore, \( \angle EGF = 90^\circ \).
   - The length of the tangent segment from a point outside a circle to the point of tangency is equal. Thus, \( EG = 16 \).

3. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem:**
   - We have a right triangle \( \triangle EFG \) with \( EF \) as one leg, \( EG \) as the hypotenuse, and \( FG \) as the other leg.
   - Using the Pythagorean theorem:
     \[
     EG^2 = EF^2 + FG^2
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     16^2 = 12^2 + FG^2
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     256 = 144 + FG^2
     \]
   - Solve for \( FG^2 \):
     \[
     FG^2 = 256 - 144 = 112
     \]
   - Take the square root to find \( FG \):
     \[
     FG = \sqrt{112} = \sqrt{16 \times 7} = 4\sqrt{7}
     \]

4. **Revisit the problem to find \( x \):**
   - Since the problem asks for \( x \) and the figure does not explicitly define \( x \) as a specific segment, we need to consider the context. Given the options provided, it seems \( x \) might be a different segment or part of the figure.
   - However, the calculation \( FG = 4\sqrt{7} \) does not match any of the provided choices directly.

Given the options and the calculated value, none of them match the exact calculated result. Therefore, we should choose the closest option which is \( \frac{14}{3} \).
