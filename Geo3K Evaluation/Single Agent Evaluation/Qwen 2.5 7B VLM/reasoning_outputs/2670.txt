First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric relationships in the figure:

1. Quadrilateral ABCD is a rectangle.
2. Angle 2 (m∠2) is given as 40 degrees.
3. We need to find the measure of angle 3 (m∠3).

In a rectangle, opposite angles are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary (sum up to 180 degrees).

Since ABCD is a rectangle, angles at vertices A, B, C, and D are right angles (90 degrees each).

Now, consider triangle ABE:
- Angle AEB is 90 degrees because it's part of rectangle ABCD.
- Angle 2 (m∠2) is given as 40 degrees.
- Therefore, angle ABE (m∠5) can be found by subtracting angle 2 from 90 degrees:
  m∠5 = 90° - 40° = 50°.

Next, consider triangle ADE:
- Since ABCD is a rectangle, AD is parallel to BC.
- Therefore, angle ADE (m∠4) is equal to angle 3 (m∠3) because they are corresponding angles.

Since angle ABE (m∠5) is 50 degrees and angle ADE (m∠4) is equal to angle 3 (m∠3), we have:
m∠3 = 50°.

Thus, the measure of angle 3 is 50 degrees.

Solution:
Based on the analysis, the measure of angle 3 is 50 degrees.
