To solve for \(KL\), we need to analyze the given geometric figure and determine the relationship between the triangles shown.

1. **Identify Given Information:**
   - Triangle \(XYZ\) has sides \(XY = 5\), \(XZ = 15\), and \(YZ = 15\).
   - Angle \(\angle YXZ = 51^\circ\).
   - Triangle \(JKL\) has side \(JL = 4\) and angle \(\angle JKL = 51^\circ\).

2. **Analyze Triangles:**
   - Both triangles share the same angle measure (\(51^\circ\)).
   - The sides \(XZ\) and \(JL\) are given as 15 and 4 respectively.

3. **Determine Similarity:**
   - Since both triangles have a common angle (\(51^\circ\)) and the sides adjacent to this angle are proportional (as they are similar triangles by AA similarity criterion).

4. **Set Up Proportion:**
   \[
   \frac{XY}{JL} = \frac{XZ}{KL}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   \frac{5}{4} = \frac{15}{KL}
   \]

5. **Solve for \(KL\):**
   Cross-multiply to solve for \(KL\):
   \[
   5 \cdot KL = 4 \cdot 15
   \]
   \[
   5 \cdot KL = 60
   \]
   \[
   KL = \frac{60}{5}
   \]
   \[
   KL = 12
   \]

</think>

<Solution>
Based on the analysis, the length of \(KL\) is 12. Therefore, the correct answer is:
