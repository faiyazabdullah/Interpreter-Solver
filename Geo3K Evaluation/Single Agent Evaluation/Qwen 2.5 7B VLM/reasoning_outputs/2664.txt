Let's analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The angle \( \angle A \) is given as 10 degrees.
   - There is a circle with points \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I \) marked on it.
   - There is an arc labeled as 95 degrees.
   - There is a line segment \( AB \).
   - There is an angle \( \angle B \) that we need to find.

2. **Understand the geometric relationships:**
   - Since the problem involves a circle, we can use circle theorems and properties.
   - The arc of 95 degrees suggests that the central angle subtended by this arc is also 95 degrees.
   - The angle \( \angle B \) is part of triangle \( \triangle ABD \).

3. **Apply circle theorems:**
   - The angle \( \angle B \) is part of the triangle \( \triangle ABD \).
   - We know \( \angle A = 10^\circ \).

To find \( \angle B \), we need more specific information about the triangle \( \triangle ABD \). However, the problem does not provide enough information about the lengths or positions of the points. Given the constraints and the provided choices, we need to infer the most likely angle.

4. **Assess the choices:**
   - The choices are A (30°), B (35°), C (47.5°), and D (90°).
   - Given the small angle \( \angle A = 10^\circ \), the angle \( \angle B \) would be relatively small as well.
   - The closest reasonable value among the choices is 35°, which fits the small angle constraint.

Based on the given information and the choices provided, the most plausible answer is 35°.
