Let's analyze the given information and the geometric relationships step by step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The diameter of \(\odot A\) is 10 units.
   - The diameter of \(\odot B\) is 30 units.
   - The diameter of \(\odot C\) is 10 units.
   - \(AZ \cong CW\).
   - \(CW = 2\).

2. **Understand the relationships:**
   - Since \(AZ \cong CW\), it means \(AZ = CW\).
   - Given \(CW = 2\), we have \(AZ = 2\).

3. **Determine the lengths involved:**
   - Since \(A\) and \(C\) are the centers of their respective circles, and the radii of \(\odot A\) and \(\odot C\) are half of their diameters:
     - Radius of \(\odot A\) = \( \frac{10}{2} = 5\).
     - Radius of \(\odot C\) = \( \frac{10}{2} = 5\).
   - Therefore, \(A\) and \(C\) are both 5 units away from points \(Z\) and \(W\), respectively.

4. **Calculate \(YW\):**
   - Since \(CW = 2\) and both \(A\) and \(C\) are 5 units away from \(Z\) and \(W\) respectively, the distance between \(Y\) and \(W\) can be determined by the fact that \(Y\) and \(W\) lie along the line segment extended from the centers of the circles.

Given the symmetry and the distances involved, the length \(YW\) would be the same as the distance between the points directly across from each other due to the congruent radii and the equal diameters of the circles \(\odot A\) and \(\odot C\).

Since the problem does not specify any additional constraints or specific lengths for the segments beyond the direct measurement of \(CW\), and considering the symmetry and the equal diameters, the length \(YW\) is effectively the same as \(CW\).

Thus, \(YW = CW = 2\).
