To solve for \( m \widehat{XZ} \), we need to analyze the given information and use geometric properties.

1. **Identify Given Information**:
   - \( \angle YZX = 68^\circ \)
   - \( \angle WXB = 224^\circ \)

2. **Understand the Relationships**:
   - The angle \( \angle YZX \) is an inscribed angle subtended by arc \( XY \).
   - The angle \( \angle WXB \) is an angle formed outside the circle, which can be related to the inscribed angle.

3. **Apply Geometric Properties**:
   - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts.
   - Therefore, \( m \widehat{XY} = 2 \times 68^\circ = 136^\circ \).

4. **Calculate \( m \widehat{XZ} \)**:
   - Since \( \widehat{XZ} \) is part of the circle and the sum of the arcs around point \( X \) must be \( 360^\circ \),
   - \( m \widehat{XZ} = 360^\circ - m \widehat{XY} = 360^\circ - 136^\circ = 224^\circ \).

However, the angle \( \angle WXB = 224^\circ \) seems to be misleading because it's an external angle and does not directly affect the calculation of the arc \( \widehat{XZ} \).

Given the options and the provided angle \( 68^\circ \), the correct approach is to recognize that the inscribed angle \( \angle YZX \) is the key to finding the arc \( \widehat{XY} \).

Since the problem asks for \( m \widehat{XZ} \) and we have already determined that the inscribed angle \( 68^\circ \) corresponds to the arc \( \widehat{XY} \), the correct interpretation should focus on the supplementary angle.

Thus, the correct measure for \( m \widehat{XZ} \) should be derived from the supplementary relationship:
\[ m \widehat{XZ} = 360^\circ - 136^\circ = 224^\circ \]

But since the angle \( 68^\circ \) is given, the supplementary angle approach should be applied correctly.

Finally, considering the supplementary relationship and the given angle \( 68^\circ \), the correct measure for \( m \widehat{XZ} \) is:
\[ m \widehat{XZ} = 180^\circ - 68^\circ = 112^\circ \]

However, the closest option among the choices provided is:
