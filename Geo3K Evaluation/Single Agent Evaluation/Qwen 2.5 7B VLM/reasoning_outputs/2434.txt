First, let's analyze the geometric figure and the given information:

1. We have a line segment RSTQ.
2. There is a point A on line segment RSTQ.
3. There is a median GH connecting point A to the midpoint of RS (let's call it M).
4. The length of RS is given as 54.
5. The length of QT is given as 86.

Since GH is the median of triangle RSA, it means GH divides the triangle into two equal areas. However, we need to find the length of GH directly.

Given that A is a point on line RSTQ, and considering the properties of medians in triangles, the median divides the triangle into two smaller triangles of equal area. Here, since GH is the median of triangle RSA, we can use the midpoint theorem or the properties of medians in a triangle.

The length of the median in a triangle can be calculated using the formula for the median of a triangle. However, in this case, we can see that GH is half the length of the base RS because it is the median connecting A to the midpoint of RS.

Therefore, the length of GH is half the length of RS.

Length of GH = (1/2) * Length of RS
Length of GH = (1/2) * 54
Length of GH = 27

So, the length of GH is 27.

Now, let's compare our calculated result with the given answer choices:
A. 27
B. 54
C. 62
D. 86

Final Answer: A
