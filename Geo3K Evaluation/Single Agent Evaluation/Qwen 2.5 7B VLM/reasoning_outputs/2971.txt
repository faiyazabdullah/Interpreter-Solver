QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:

<think>
To solve for \( b \) in the given parallelogram, we need to use the property that opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal. Let's analyze the given lengths:

- Side \( XY \) is labeled as \( 3a + 7 \).
- Side \( WZ \) is labeled as \( 4a \).

Since \( XY \) and \( WZ \) are opposite sides of the parallelogram, they must be equal:
\[ 3a + 7 = 4a \]

Now, solve for \( a \):
\[ 3a + 7 = 4a \]
\[ 7 = 4a - 3a \]
\[ 7 = a \]

Next, we need to find \( b \). Side \( WY \) is labeled as \( 2b \), and side \( WX \) is labeled as \( b + 11 \).

Since \( WY \) and \( WX \) are also opposite sides of the parallelogram, they must be equal:
\[ 2b = b + 11 \]

Now, solve for \( b \):
\[ 2b = b + 11 \]
\[ 2b - b = 11 \]
\[ b = 11 \]

Thus, the value of \( b \) is 11.
