Let's analyze the geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the shapes and given measurements:**
   - We have a triangle \( \triangle MON \) with sides \( MO = 5 \), \( ON = 6 \), and \( NM = 3\frac{3}{5} \).
   - There is a parallelogram \( PQNO \) within the triangle, where \( PQ \parallel ON \) and \( PN \parallel OM \).

2. **Understand the relationship between the parallelogram and the triangle:**
   - Since \( PQNO \) is a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. Therefore, \( PQ = NO \) and \( PN = QO \).
   - Given \( ON = 6 \), we know \( PQ = 6 \).

3. **Determine the length \( PQ \):**
   - The length \( PQ \) is directly given as part of the parallelogram properties since it matches the side \( NO \) of the triangle.

Now, let's compare our findings with the given answer choices:
- The length \( PQ \) is explicitly stated as 6 in the parallelogram configuration.

Given these observations, we can conclude that the correct answer is:
