Let's analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify Given Information**:
   - The line segment \( AB \) is parallel to the line segment \( DC \).
   - Angle \( D \) is marked as \( 65^\circ \).

2. **Understand the Relationships**:
   - Since \( AB \parallel DC \), we can use the properties of parallel lines and transversals.
   - When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal, alternate interior angles are equal, and same-side interior angles are supplementary.

3. **Determine the Angle \( x \)**:
   - Angle \( x \) and angle \( D \) are adjacent angles formed by the intersection of the transversal \( AC \) with the parallel lines \( AB \) and \( DC \).
   - These angles are supplementary because they form a linear pair (they add up to \( 180^\circ \)).

4. **Calculate Angle \( x \)**:
   - Since \( AB \parallel DC \), angle \( x \) and angle \( D \) together form a straight line.
   - Therefore, \( x + 65^\circ = 180^\circ \).
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 180^\circ - 65^\circ = 115^\circ
     \]

5. **Compare with Answer Choices**:
   - The calculated value \( x = 115^\circ \) matches the answer choice \( D \).

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: D
