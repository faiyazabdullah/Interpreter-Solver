To find the area of the triangle, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle, which is (base * height) / 2. From the image, we have the base length BC = 10.2 ft and the height AD = 7 ft.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Identify the base and height of the triangle.
2. Substitute the values into the area formula.
3. Calculate the area.
4. Round the result to the nearest tenth if necessary.

Let's proceed with the calculation:

Area = (base * height) / 2
Area = (10.2 ft * 7 ft) / 2
Area = (71.4 ft²) / 2
Area = 35.7 ft²

Rounding to the nearest tenth gives us 35.7 ft².

Comparing our calculated result with the given answer choices, we see that it matches option A.
