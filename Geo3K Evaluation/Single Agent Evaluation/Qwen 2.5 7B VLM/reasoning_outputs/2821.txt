Let's analyze the given geometric figure:

1. **Identify the Shape**: The figure is a quadrilateral labeled as ABCD, which is stated to be a rhombus.
2. **Given Information**:
   - AB = 2x + 3
   - BC = x + 7
   - Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal.
3. **Objective**: Find CD.

Since ABCD is a rhombus, all its sides are equal. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ AB = BC = CD \]

From the given information:
\[ AB = 2x + 3 \]
\[ BC = x + 7 \]

Since these are equal, we can set them equal to each other:
\[ 2x + 3 = x + 7 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 2x + 3 = x + 7 \]
\[ 2x - x = 7 - 3 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

Now substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the expression for AB:
\[ AB = 2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11 \]

Since AB = BC = CD, we have:
\[ CD = AB = BC = 11 \]

Thus, the length of CD is 11.
