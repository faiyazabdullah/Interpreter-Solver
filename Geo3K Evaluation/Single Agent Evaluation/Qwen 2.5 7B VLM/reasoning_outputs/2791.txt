Let's analyze the geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify Given Information:**
   - \( FG = 18 \)
   - \( GH = 42 \)
   - \( FK = 15 \)

2. **Understand the Relationships:**
   - The points \( F, G, H, J, K \) appear to form a circle.
   - The segments \( FG, GH, \) and \( FK \) are chords of the circle.
   - We need to find the length of \( a \), which could represent the diameter or another chord related to these given lengths.

3. **Apply Relevant Theorems:**
   - Since \( FG \) and \( GH \) are connected at point \( G \), we can consider the sum of their lengths.
   - Similarly, \( FK \) appears to connect point \( K \) to the circle's circumference.

4. **Summarize Known Values:**
   - Total length involving \( FG \) and \( GH \): \( FG + GH = 18 + 42 = 60 \).

5. **Revisit the Length \( FK \):**
   - Given \( FK = 15 \).

6. **Consider Possible Relationships:**
   - If \( FK \) were part of the same segment or chord involving the circle, it would add up linearly with \( FG \) and \( GH \).
   - However, without further information about how \( FK \) relates to \( FG \) and \( GH \), we can only sum the given lengths directly.

7. **Calculate \( a \):**
   - Since no additional relationships or specific theorem directly applies here (like the intersecting chords theorem), we assume \( a \) is simply the sum of the given lengths.

Thus, combining all known lengths:
\[ a = FG + GH + FK = 18 + 42 + 15 = 75 \]

8. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The closest value among the given choices is 42.
