Let's analyze the given parallelogram:

1. **Identify the given dimensions:**
   - Base (BC) = 21 ft
   - Height (AD) = 17 ft
   - Side length opposite BC (AD) = 8 ft

2. **Understand the properties of a parallelogram:**
   - Opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal in length.
   - The perimeter is the sum of all its sides.

3. **Calculate the perimeter:**
   - Since BC = AD and CD = AB, we have:
     - BC = 21 ft
     - AD = 8 ft
     - AB = CD = 8 ft (opposite sides of a parallelogram)

4. **Sum the lengths of all four sides:**
   \[
   \text{Perimeter} = BC + AB + AD + CD = 21 + 8 + 8 + 8
   \]

5. **Perform the addition:**
   \[
   21 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 45
   \]

Since the calculated perimeter is 45 ft, none of the provided answer choices match this value. However, the question asks to round to the nearest tenth if necessary. Given that there's no need for rounding here, we should consider the closest answer choice.

6. **Compare with the given choices:**
   - A. 66
   - B. 68
   - C. 74
   - D. 76

Since our calculated perimeter is 45 ft, which does not match any of the choices, we must select the closest reasonable answer. The closest choice to 45 ft among the provided options is B.

Final Answer: B
