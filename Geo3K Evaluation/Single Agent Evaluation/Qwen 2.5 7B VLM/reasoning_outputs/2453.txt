QUESTION:
The diagonals of rhombus F G H J intersect at K. If G H = x + 9 and J H = 5 x - 2, find x.

CHOICES:
A. 2.75
B. 3
C. 5.5
D. 9

<thought>
To solve for \( x \) in the given problem, we need to use the fact that the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. This means that the diagonals divide the rhombus into four right triangles. Additionally, the lengths of the diagonals in a rhombus are related to the side length of the rhombus.

Given:
- \( GH = x + 9 \)
- \( JH = 5x - 2 \)

Since \( GH \) and \( JH \) are equal (as they are opposite sides of the rhombus), we can set up the equation:

\[ x + 9 = 5x - 2 \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
   \[ 9 = 4x - 2 \]

2. Add 2 to both sides:
   \[ 11 = 4x \]

3. Divide both sides by 4:
   \[ x = \frac{11}{4} = 2.75 \]

Thus, the value of \( x \) is 2.75.

<solution>
The value of \( x \) is 2.75. Comparing this with the given answer choices, we see that it matches choice A.

Final Answer: A
