Let's analyze the given trapezoid QRUT with midpoints V and S of legs QU and RT respectively. We know the lengths QR = 4 and UT = 16. We need to find the length VS.

### Step 1: Understanding the Midsegment Theorem
The midsegment theorem for a trapezoid states that the segment joining the midpoints of the non-parallel sides (legs) is parallel to the bases and its length is the average of the lengths of the bases.

### Step 2: Applying the Midsegment Theorem
According to the midsegment theorem:
\[ VS = \frac{QR + UT}{2} \]

### Step 3: Substituting the Given Values
Substitute the known values:
\[ VS = \frac{4 + 16}{2} \]

### Step 4: Calculating the Length
\[ VS = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \]

### Step 5: Comparing with the Answer Choices
The calculated length VS is 10. The closest answer choice to 10 is C.
