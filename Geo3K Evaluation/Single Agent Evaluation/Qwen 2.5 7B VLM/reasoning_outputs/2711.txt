Let's analyze the given geometric figure:

1. The triangle ABC is shown with angle CBA = 90 degrees, indicating it is a right triangle.
2. The hypotenuse AB is labeled as x.
3. One leg AC is given as 12 units long.
4. Another leg BC is labeled as y.
5. Angle CAB is given as 45 degrees.

Since triangle ABC is a right triangle with a 45-degree angle at CAB, it is a 45-45-90 triangle. In such triangles, the legs are equal, and the hypotenuse is \(\sqrt{2}\) times longer than each leg.

Given that AC = 12, we can determine the length of the other leg (BC) since they are equal in a 45-45-90 triangle:

\[ AC = BC = 12 \]

Therefore, \( y = 12 \).

Now, let's compare our calculated result with the given answer choices:
- A. \(\sqrt{2}\)
- B. \(3\sqrt{2}\)
- C. \(6\sqrt{2}\)
- D. \(9\sqrt{2}\)

None of these match our calculated value of 12. Since none of the choices exactly match our calculation, we need to select the closest option which is C (\(6\sqrt{2}\)).

However, considering the problem constraints and the closest match, the closest answer would be:
Final Answer: C
