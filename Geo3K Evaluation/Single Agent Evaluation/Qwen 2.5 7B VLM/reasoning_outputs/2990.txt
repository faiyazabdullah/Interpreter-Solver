To solve for the measure of angle 8, we need to analyze the geometric relationships in the given figure. Here’s the step-by-step thought process:

1. **Identify Given Information**:
   - \( m\angle 1 = 50^\circ \)
   - \( m\angle 3 = 60^\circ \)

2. **Understand the Relationships**:
   - Angle 1 and angle 3 appear to be part of a straight line or related to a transversal intersecting parallel lines (based on the visual layout).
   - Angles on a straight line sum up to 180 degrees.

3. **Calculate the Sum of Angles on the Straight Line**:
   - Since angles on a straight line sum up to 180 degrees, we can find the measure of the remaining angle adjacent to angle 1 and angle 3.

4. **Determine the Measure of Angle 8**:
   - Angle 8 appears to be supplementary to the angle formed by the intersection of the transversal and the parallel lines. Given the layout and the properties of parallel lines cut by a transversal, angle 8 would be the sum of the remaining angle after subtracting 50 and 60 degrees from 180 degrees.

Let's calculate it step-by-step:
- Total degrees on a straight line: 180°
- Subtract angle 1: 180° - 50° = 130°
- Subtract angle 3: 130° - 60° = 70°

However, since angle 8 is supplementary to the remaining angle, we need to consider the full straight-line property:
- Angle 8 = 180° - 70° = 110°

Thus, the measure of angle 8 is 110 degrees.

Solution:
Based on the analysis, the measure of angle 8 is 110 degrees.
