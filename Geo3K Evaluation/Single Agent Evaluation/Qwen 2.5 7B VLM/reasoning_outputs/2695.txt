First, let's analyze the given information in the image:

1. We have a circle with center B.
2. There are two straight lines intersecting the circle at points M, N, L, and P.
3. The angle ∠MLN is given as 78°.
4. The angle ∠MNL is given as 36°.
5. We need to find the measure of arc LP (m ∠LAP).

To solve for m ∠LAP, we can use the property that the angle subtended by an arc at the center of the circle is twice the angle subtended by the same arc at any point on the circumference of the circle. However, since we are dealing with a straight line intersecting the circle, we will use the fact that the sum of opposite angles formed by two intersecting lines is 180°.

From the given information:
- ∠MLN = 78°
- ∠MNL = 36°

Since these angles form part of a straight line, the remaining angle ∠NLMP can be calculated as:
∠NLMP = 180° - (∠MLN + ∠MNL)
∠NLMP = 180° - (78° + 36°)
∠NLMP = 180° - 114°
∠NLMP = 66°

Now, consider triangle NLMP. Since ∠NLMP = 66° and ∠MNL = 36°, the third angle ∠NMP can be found as follows:
∠NMP = 180° - (∠NLMP + ∠MNL)
∠NMP = 180° - (66° + 36°)
∠NMP = 180° - 102°
∠NMP = 78°

Since ∠NMP = 78°, it means that the arc corresponding to this angle is also 78°. Therefore, the measure of arc LP is:
m ∠LAP = 2 × 78° = 156°

Comparing our calculated result with the given answer choices, we see that 156° matches option D.
