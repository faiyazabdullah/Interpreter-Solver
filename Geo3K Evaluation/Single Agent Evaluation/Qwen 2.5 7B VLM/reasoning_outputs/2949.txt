Let's analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the Shape**: The figure appears to be a trapezoid because it has one pair of parallel sides (AB and CD). The lengths of the parallel sides are given as AB = 11 km and CD = 8 km.
   
2. **Height of the Trapezoid**: The height of the trapezoid is given as 10 km. This is the perpendicular distance between the parallel sides AB and CD.

3. **Area Formula for a Trapezoid**: The area \( A \) of a trapezoid can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times (b_1 + b_2) \times h
   \]
   where \( b_1 \) and \( b_2 \) are the lengths of the parallel sides, and \( h \) is the height.

4. **Substitute the Given Values**:
   - \( b_1 = 11 \) km
   - \( b_2 = 8 \) km
   - \( h = 10 \) km

   Plugging these values into the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times (11 + 8) \times 10
   \]
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 19 \times 10
   \]
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 190
   \]
   \[
   A = 95 \text{ km}^2
   \]

5. **Rounding**: The calculated area is 95 kmÂ². Since this value matches one of the given choices, no rounding is necessary.

Given the choices:
- A. 80
- B. 90
- C. 95
- D. 110

The closest and most accurate answer is C.
