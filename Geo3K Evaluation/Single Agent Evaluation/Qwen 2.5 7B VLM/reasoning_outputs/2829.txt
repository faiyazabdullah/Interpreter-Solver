Let's analyze the image step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Shape**: The figure appears to be a regular polygon inscribed in a circle. The polygon has vertices labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J.

2. **Given Information**: The radius of the circle is given as 21 units.

3. **Regular Polygon Properties**:
   - All sides are equal.
   - All interior angles are equal.
   - The polygon can be divided into congruent isosceles triangles by drawing radii to each vertex.

4. **Number of Sides**: Since there are 10 vertices (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J), the polygon is a decagon (10-sided polygon).

5. **Area Calculation**:
   - The area of a regular polygon can be calculated using the formula: \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times n \times s^2 \times \sin(\frac{360^\circ}{n}) \), where \( n \) is the number of sides and \( s \) is the side length.
   - However, since we have the radius and need the area of the shaded region, we can use the fact that the polygon can be divided into 10 congruent isosceles triangles, each with a central angle of \(36^\circ\).

6. **Using the Formula for Sector Area**:
   - The area of one sector of the circle (which corresponds to one of these isosceles triangles) is \( \text{Area} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi r^2 \), where \( \theta = 36^\circ \).
   - Therefore, the area of one sector is \( \frac{36^\circ}{360^\circ} \times \pi \times 21^2 = \frac{1}{10} \times \pi \times 441 = 44.1\pi \).

7. **Total Area of the Decagon**:
   - Since the decagon consists of 10 such sectors, the total area is \( 10 \times 44.1\pi \approx 1323 \).

8. **Shaded Region**:
   - The shaded region is the area of the decagon minus the area of the smaller central circle formed by the inscribed polygon.
   - The central circle's diameter is equal to the side length of the decagon, which can be derived using trigonometric relationships, but for simplicity, let's assume it's approximately half the diagonal of a square formed by the radius.

9. **Approximate Side Length**:
   - Using the properties of a regular decagon, the side length \( s \) can be approximated as \( s \approx 2r \sin(18^\circ) \approx 2 \times 21 \times 0.309 = 13.08 \).

10. **Central Circle Area**:
    - The radius of the central circle is approximately \( s/\sqrt{2} \approx 13.08/\sqrt{2} \approx 9.24 \).
    - The area of the central circle is \( \pi \times 9.24^2 \approx 85.5 \).

11. **Shaded Region Area**:
    - Subtract the area of the central circle from the total area of the decagon: \( 1323 - 85.5 \approx 1237.5 \).

Comparing with the choices:
- The closest value to 1237.5 is 1283.6.

Since none of the choices match exactly, the closest value to our calculated result is:
