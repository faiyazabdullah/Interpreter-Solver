QUESTION:
Find the perimeter of the figure. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.

CHOICES:
A. 20
B. 21
C. 24
D. 25

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
<think> Let's start by analyzing the geometric figure:

1. The figure consists of two rectangles placed side by side.
2. The first rectangle has dimensions 5 units (length) and 2 units (width).
3. The second rectangle also has dimensions 5 units (length) and 2 units (width).
4. The total length of the figure is the sum of the lengths of both rectangles.
5. The total width of the figure is the sum of the widths of both rectangles.
6. To find the perimeter of the figure, we need to add up the lengths of all its sides.

Calculating the perimeter:
- The total length is \(5 + 5 = 10\) units.
- The total width is \(2 + 2 = 4\) units.
- Since the figure is composed of two rectangles placed side by side, there are no overlapping sides, so the perimeter can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (10 + 4) \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 14 \]
\[ \text{Perimeter} = 28 \]

Since 28 is not among the answer choices, we need to round it to the nearest tenth:
\[ 28 \approx 28 \]

Comparing with the given answer choices:
- A. 20
- B. 21
- C. 24
- D. 25

The closest value to 28 is 28 itself, which is not listed. However, since the instructions state to select the closest option, we will choose the next closest value.

Final Answer: B</think>

<solution>
To find the perimeter of the figure:
1. Calculate the total length: \(5 + 5 = 10\).
2. Calculate the total width: \(2 + 2 = 4\).
3. Calculate the perimeter: \(2 \times (10 + 4) = 28\).

Rounding to the nearest tenth: 28.

Comparing with the answer choices:
- A. 20
- B. 21
- C. 24
- D. 25

The closest value is 28, but since it's not listed, we select the next closest value, which is 28.

Final Answer: B</solution>
