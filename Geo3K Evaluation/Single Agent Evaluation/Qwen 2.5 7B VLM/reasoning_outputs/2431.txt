To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the Given Information:**
   - We have a regular hexagon \( U V W X Y Z \).
   - The side length of the hexagon is given as 12 cm.
   - We need to find the length \( WY \).

2. **Understand the Geometry:**
   - A regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles.
   - Each internal angle of a regular hexagon is 120 degrees.
   - The diagonals of the hexagon connect opposite vertices and divide the hexagon into 2 equilateral triangles.

3. **Analyze the Diagonal \( WY \):**
   - Diagonal \( WY \) spans across two sides of the hexagon.
   - In a regular hexagon, the diagonal connecting two non-adjacent vertices (like \( WY \)) is equal to twice the side length.
   - Therefore, \( WY = 2 \times \text{side length} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \) cm.

However, the options provided do not include 24. Let's consider the next possible interpretation:
- The diagonal \( WY \) can also be seen as the longer diagonal of the hexagon, which forms an equilateral triangle with the side and the diagonal of another smaller hexagon.
- The formula for the longer diagonal \( d \) in a regular hexagon is \( d = \sqrt{3} \times s \), where \( s \) is the side length.
- Here, \( d = \sqrt{3} \times 12 = 12\sqrt{3} \).

Given the options, the closest match is \( 12\sqrt{3} \).
