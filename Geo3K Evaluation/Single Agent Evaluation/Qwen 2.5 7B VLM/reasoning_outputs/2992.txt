First, let's analyze the given geometric figure:

1. There is a circle with points A, B, C, D, E, and H marked on it.
2. Segments AI, CI, and DI appear to be tangent to the circle at points I, C, and D respectively.
3. Angle ACI is given as 85°.
4. Angle BCI is given as 230°.
5. We need to find the measure of angle 2, which is ∠BCI.

Given that segments AI, CI, and DI are tangent to the circle at points I, C, and D respectively, we can use the property of tangents drawn from a point to a circle, which states that the lengths of the tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal.

However, for finding the measure of ∠BCI, we need to consider the straight line formed by extending CI and BI. The straight line formed by extending these tangents would make a full circle, which means the sum of the angles around point C is 360°.

Since ∠ACI = 85° and ∠BCI = 230°, we can deduce that ∠BCI is the external angle to the circle at point C. The measure of the angle formed by the two tangents at point C is supplementary to the angle subtended by the arc AB at the center of the circle. 

Given that the total angle around point C is 360°, and considering the angles ∠ACI and ∠BCI, we can calculate the measure of ∠BCI directly.

Let's calculate:
- ∠BCI = 360° - ∠ACI - ∠BCI = 360° - 85° - 230° = 45°.

Therefore, the measure of ∠BCI (which is ∠2) is 45°.

Comparing our calculation with the given answer choices, none of them match exactly. However, since we have to choose the closest option, we select the closest one.
