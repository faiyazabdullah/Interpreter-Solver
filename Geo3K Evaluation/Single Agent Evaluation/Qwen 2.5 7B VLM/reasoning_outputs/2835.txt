First, let's analyze the given information:
- We have a circle with an area of \(18\pi\) square units.
- Inside this circle, there is a square inscribed in it.

We need to find the length of a side of the square.

Step 1: Calculate the radius of the circle.
The formula for the area of a circle is \(A = \pi r^2\). Given \(A = 18\pi\), we can set up the equation:
\[
\pi r^2 = 18\pi
\]
Dividing both sides by \(\pi\):
\[
r^2 = 18
\]
Taking the square root of both sides:
\[
r = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}
\]

Step 2: Relate the circle's radius to the square.
When a square is inscribed in a circle, the diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle. Therefore, the diameter \(d\) of the circle is:
\[
d = 2r = 2 \times 3\sqrt{2} = 6\sqrt{2}
\]

Step 3: Use the relationship between the side length and the diagonal of the square.
If the side length of the square is \(s\), then the diagonal of the square is \(s\sqrt{2}\). Since the diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle, we have:
\[
s\sqrt{2} = 6\sqrt{2}
\]

Step 4: Solve for \(s\).
Dividing both sides by \(\sqrt{2}\):
\[
s = 6
\]

Thus, the length of a side of the square is \(6\).
