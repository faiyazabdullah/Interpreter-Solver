First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric relationships in the rectangle D E F G:

1. **Identify the given angles:**
   - \( m\angle EDF = 5x - 3 \)
   - \( m\angle DFG = 3x + 7 \)

2. **Understand the properties of a rectangle:**
   - All angles in a rectangle are right angles (90 degrees).
   - Opposite angles are equal.
   - Adjacent angles sum up to 180 degrees.

3. **Calculate the sum of adjacent angles:**
   Since \( \angle EDF \) and \( \angle DFG \) are adjacent angles, their sum should be 180 degrees:
   \[
   (5x - 3) + (3x + 7) = 180
   \]

4. **Combine like terms:**
   \[
   5x + 3x - 3 + 7 = 180
   \]
   \[
   8x + 4 = 180
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   8x + 4 = 180
   \]
   \[
   8x = 176
   \]
   \[
   x = 22
   \]

6. **Substitute \( x \) back into the expression for \( \angle EDF \):**
   \[
   m\angle EDF = 5x - 3
   \]
   \[
   m\angle EDF = 5(22) - 3
   \]
   \[
   m\angle EDF = 110 - 3
   \]
   \[
   m\angle EDF = 107
   \]

Since we need to find the value of \( m\angle EDF \), and it seems there was a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem. The correct approach should be to directly use the given expressions without solving for \( x \). Given the problem setup, the correct calculation should be:

\[ m\angle EDF = 5x - 3 \]
\[ m\angle EDF = 5(22) - 3 \]
\[ m\angle EDF = 110 - 3 \]
\[ m\angle EDF = 107 \]

However, the correct answer choice among the provided options is not matching. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the given choices:

Given the closest option that matches our calculation, the correct answer should be:
