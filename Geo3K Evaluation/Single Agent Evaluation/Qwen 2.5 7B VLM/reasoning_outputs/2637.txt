To solve for \( x \), we need to use the Pythagorean theorem since we have a right triangle (indicated by the perpendicular line). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (\( c \)) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (\( a \) and \( b \)). The formula is:

\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \]

In this problem:
- The hypotenuse \( c = 25.5 \)
- One leg \( a = 12 \)
- We need to find the other leg \( b = x \)

Let's plug in the known values into the Pythagorean theorem:

\[ 25.5^2 = 12^2 + x^2 \]

Calculate \( 25.5^2 \):

\[ 25.5^2 = 650.25 \]

Calculate \( 12^2 \):

\[ 12^2 = 144 \]

Now substitute these values into the equation:

\[ 650.25 = 144 + x^2 \]

Subtract 144 from both sides to isolate \( x^2 \):

\[ x^2 = 650.25 - 144 \]
\[ x^2 = 506.25 \]

Take the square root of both sides to solve for \( x \):

\[ x = \sqrt{506.25} \]
\[ x \approx 22.5 \]

Since the question asks for the value of \( x \) to the nearest tenth, the value is \( 22.5 \).
