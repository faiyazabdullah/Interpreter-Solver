Let's analyze the given problem step by step:

1. We have a cyclic quadrilateral \( WXYZ \) inscribed in circle \(\odot V\).
2. We need to find the measure of angle \( \angle X \).
3. The problem provides us with two exterior angles: \( \angle WZV = 60^\circ \) and \( \angle VWX = 95^\circ \).

In a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum up to \(180^\circ\). However, we will use the property that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

Since \( \angle WZV \) and \( \angle VWX \) are exterior angles, we can relate them to the interior angles of the quadrilateral.

Key point:
- The exterior angle \( \angle WZV \) forms an angle with the chord \( WZ \) and the radius \( VZ \).
- The exterior angle \( \angle VWX \) forms an angle with the chord \( VW \) and the radius \( VX \).

Given the exterior angles, we can infer the following:
- \( \angle WZV = 60^\circ \)
- \( \angle VWX = 95^\circ \)

To find \( \angle X \):
- Since \( \angle WZV \) is part of the cyclic quadrilateral, it forms an angle with the chord \( WZ \) and the radius \( VZ \).
- Similarly, \( \angle VWX \) forms an angle with the chord \( VW \) and the radius \( VX \).

Using the property of cyclic quadrilaterals:
\[ \angle X = 180^\circ - \angle WZV = 180^\circ - 60^\circ = 120^\circ \]

However, since \( \angle VWX = 95^\circ \) is an exterior angle, we need to consider the supplementary angle:
\[ \angle X = 180^\circ - 95^\circ = 85^\circ \]

Thus, the correct value for \( \angle X \) is:
\[ \boxed{85} \]
