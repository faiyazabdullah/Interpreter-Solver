Let's analyze the geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the given angles**: We know \( m\angle 1 = 50^\circ \) and \( m\angle 3 = 60^\circ \).
2. **Understand the relationships**: The figure appears to be a triangle divided into smaller triangles and parallelograms. We need to find the measure of \( \angle 6 \).
3. **Use the properties of parallel lines and transversals**: Since there are parallel lines and transversals, we can use the fact that corresponding angles are equal and alternate interior angles are equal.
4. **Identify the relevant triangles**: Triangle \( \triangle ABC \) seems to be central in our analysis, as it contains both \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 3 \).
5. **Calculate the missing angle**: The sum of angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \). If we consider the angles around point \( C \), we can deduce the measure of \( \angle 6 \).

Let's calculate:
- \( m\angle 1 + m\angle 3 + m\angle 6 = 180^\circ \)
- Substituting the known values: \( 50^\circ + 60^\circ + m\angle 6 = 180^\circ \)
- Simplifying: \( 110^\circ + m\angle 6 = 180^\circ \)
- Solving for \( m\angle 6 \): \( m\angle 6 = 180^\circ - 110^\circ = 70^\circ \)

Thus, the measure of \( \angle 6 \) is \( 70^\circ \).

<solution>
The measure of \( \angle 6 \) is \( 70^\circ \).
