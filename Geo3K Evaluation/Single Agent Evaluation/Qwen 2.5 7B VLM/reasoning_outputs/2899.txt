Let's analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - C W = W F
   - E D = 30
   - D F is the segment we need to find.

2. **Understand the geometric relationships:**
   - The figure shows a circle with center W.
   - Line segments C W and W F are equal, indicating symmetry around point W.
   - Line segment E D is given as 30.
   - Line segment D F is perpendicular to line segment E D at point F.

3. **Apply relevant geometric theorems:**
   - Since C W = W F, triangle C W F is isosceles with W being the vertex angle.
   - Given that D F is perpendicular to E D, triangle D F E is a right triangle with a 90-degree angle at F.

4. **Calculate D F:**
   - Since E D = 30 and D F is the leg of the right triangle, and knowing the properties of the isosceles triangle, D F must be half of E D because W is the midpoint of the arc AB and DE.
   - Therefore, D F = E D / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15.

Thus, the length of D F is 15.
