<thought>
Let's start by analyzing the given geometric figure:

1. **Identify the shapes and lines**: The figure includes a right triangle (ABC) with a smaller right triangle (BCD) inside it. The hypotenuse of the larger triangle (AB) is labeled as \(z\).

2. **Given Information**:
   - The length of segment BC (the base of the smaller triangle) is 8.
   - The length of segment CD (the height of the smaller triangle) is 6.
   - The length of segment AB (the hypotenuse of the larger triangle) is \(z\).
   - The length of segment AD is the hypotenuse of the larger triangle, which we need to find.

3. **Relationships**:
   - The triangles ABC and BCD are similar because they both have a right angle and share the angle at C.

4. **Similar Triangles**:
   - Since the triangles are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional. Therefore, the ratio of the corresponding sides of the larger triangle to the smaller triangle is the same.

5. **Calculate the hypotenuse**:
   - Using the Pythagorean theorem for triangle BCD:
     \[
     BC^2 + CD^2 = BD^2
     \]
     Substituting the given values:
     \[
     8^2 + 6^2 = BD^2
     \]
     \[
     64 + 36 = BD^2
     \]
     \[
     100 = BD^2
     \]
     \[
     BD = 10
     \]

6. **Calculate the hypotenuse of the larger triangle**:
   - Since triangles ABC and BCD are similar, the ratio of the hypotenuses is the same as the ratio of the bases:
     \[
     \frac{AB}{BD} = \frac{z}{10}
     \]
     We know AB = \(z\) and BD = 10, so:
     \[
     \frac{z}{10} = \frac{z}{z} = 1
     \]
     Simplifying this gives:
     \[
     z = 10
     \]

<solution>
Based on the calculations, the value of \(z\) is 10.
