Let's analyze the geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - There is a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
   - Angle \( \angle ACB = 60^\circ \).
   - Side \( AB = 20 \).

2. **Determine the type of triangle:**
   - Since angle \( \angle ACB = 60^\circ \) and \( AB \) is the hypotenuse, \( \triangle ABC \) could be a right triangle with \( \angle BAC = 90^\circ \) and \( \angle ABC = 30^\circ \). However, we need to check if this is possible.

3. **Use trigonometric relationships:**
   - If \( \angle ABC = 30^\circ \), then side \( BC \) (opposite to \( 30^\circ \)) would be half of the hypotenuse \( AB \).
   - Therefore, \( BC = \frac{AB}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).

4. **Calculate side \( y \):**
   - In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio \( 1 : \sqrt{3} : 2 \).
   - Here, the hypotenuse is 20, so the shorter leg \( BC = 10 \).
   - The longer leg \( AC \) would be \( 10\sqrt{3} \).

5. **Identify the correct answer choice:**
   - The value of \( y \) is the length of the longer leg \( AC \), which is \( 10\sqrt{3} \).
   - Comparing with the answer choices, none of them match \( 10\sqrt{3} \).

Since the calculated value does not match any of the provided choices, we need to select the closest one. The closest value to \( 10\sqrt{3} \approx 17.32 \) is not available among the choices.

Given the problem constraints and the closest option:
