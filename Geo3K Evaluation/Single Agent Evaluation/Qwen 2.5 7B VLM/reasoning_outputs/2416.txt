Let's analyze the given geometric figure:

1. We have two intersecting lines at point B, creating four angles.
2. The angles at the intersection are labeled as follows:
   - Angle ABE = (8y + 2)째
   - Angle ABC = (25y - 20)째
   - Angle ABD = 10x째
3. Since these are adjacent angles formed by a straight line, they sum up to 180째.

We need to find the value of y.

First, we set up the equation for the sum of angles around point B:
\[ (8y + 2) + (25y - 20) + 10x = 180 \]

However, since we only need to find y, let's isolate it first:
\[ 8y + 2 + 25y - 20 = 180 \]
\[ 33y - 18 = 180 \]
\[ 33y = 198 \]
\[ y = \frac{198}{33} \]
\[ y = 6 \]

So, y = 6.

Now, let's compare our result with the given answer choices:
A. 5
B. 6
C. 7
D. 8
