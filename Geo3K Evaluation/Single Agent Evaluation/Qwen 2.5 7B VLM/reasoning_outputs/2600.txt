Let's analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the Shape**: The figure shows a rectangle \(ABCD\) with diagonals intersecting at point \(C\).
2. **Given Information**:
   - Length of diagonal \(AD = 16\)
   - Length of side \(CD = 8\)
   - We need to find the length of side \(BC\), which is labeled as \(x\).

3. **Properties of Rectangle**:
   - Opposite sides of a rectangle are equal.
   - Diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other and are equal in length.

4. **Using Pythagorean Theorem**:
   Since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find \(BC\):
   \[
   AD^2 = AB^2 + BC^2
   \]
   Here, \(AD = 16\) and \(CD = 8\). However, since \(AB = CD\) (opposite sides of a rectangle), let's denote \(AB = y\).

5. **Applying the Pythagorean Theorem**:
   \[
   16^2 = y^2 + x^2
   \]
   Since \(y = 8\),
   \[
   16^2 = 8^2 + x^2
   \]
   Simplifying,
   \[
   256 = 64 + x^2
   \]
   \[
   x^2 = 192
   \]
   \[
   x = \sqrt{192} = \sqrt{64 \times 3} = 8\sqrt{3}
   \]

6. **Comparison with Given Options**:
   - The calculated value of \(x\) is \(8\sqrt{3}\).
   - Comparing with the answer choices:
     - A. \(2\sqrt{3}\)
     - B. \(4\sqrt{3}\)
     - C. \(6\sqrt{3}\)
     - D. \(8\sqrt{3}\)

The closest match is D.
