To solve for \( m \angle ACD \), we need to analyze the given parallelogram \( ABCD \) and use the properties of parallelograms. Here are the key points to consider:

1. **Identify Given Information**: 
   - \( AB = BC = AD = CD = 13 \)
   - \( AC = 2x + 7 \)
   - \( BD = 10 \)
   - \( \angle ABD = 20^\circ \)
   - \( \angle BCD = 49^\circ \)

2. **Understand Relationships**:
   - In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel.
   - The diagonals bisect each other.
   - Consecutive angles are supplementary (add up to \(180^\circ\)).
   - Opposite angles are equal.

3. **Determine Angle Relationships**:
   - Since \( \angle ABD = 20^\circ \) and \( \angle BCD = 49^\circ \), we can infer that \( \angle ACD \) is related to these angles because they form part of the same cyclic quadrilateral or triangle properties within the parallelogram.

4. **Calculate \( m \angle ACD \)**:
   - Since \( \angle ACD \) is part of the parallelogram's interior, and considering the angles around point \( F \) where the diagonals intersect, we need to look at the angles formed by the diagonals and the sides of the parallelogram.

Given the angles and the properties of the parallelogram, the angle \( m \angle ACD \) is directly related to the given angles. Specifically, since \( \angle ABD = 20^\circ \) and \( \angle BCD = 49^\circ \), we can deduce that the angle \( m \angle ACD \) is the supplement of the given angles minus any overlapping angles at point \( F \).

By analyzing the angles, it becomes clear that the angle \( m \angle ACD \) is supplementary to the sum of the given angles, which simplifies to \( 180^\circ - 20^\circ - 49^\circ = 111^\circ \). However, the specific angle we need is the one formed at the intersection, which is \( 49^\circ \) due to the properties of the parallelogram.

Thus, the correct angle is \( 49^\circ \).

Solution:

Since the angle \( m \angle ACD \) is directly related to the given angles and properties of the parallelogram, the correct angle is \( 49^\circ \).
