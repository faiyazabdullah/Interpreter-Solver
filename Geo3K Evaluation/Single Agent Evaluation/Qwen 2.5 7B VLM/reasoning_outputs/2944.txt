First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric relationships in the figure:

1. Quadrilateral WXYZ is a rectangle.
2. We know the measure of angle 1 (m∠1) is 30°.
3. Angles in a rectangle have specific properties:
   - All interior angles are right angles (90°).
   - Opposite sides are equal and parallel.
   - Diagonals bisect each other.

Given that WXYZ is a rectangle, we can deduce the following:
- Since opposite angles are equal and supplementary, if m∠1 = 30°, then the adjacent angle (m∠2) must be supplementary to it.
- Supplementary angles add up to 180°.

Now, calculate m∠2:
\[ m∠2 = 180° - m∠1 = 180° - 30° = 150° \]

However, there seems to be a misunderstanding because the problem states that m∠2 is part of a triangle formed within the rectangle, specifically ΔWZX. In ΔWZX, m∠1 and m∠2 are not supplementary but rather part of the same triangle's internal angles.

Let's re-evaluate the angles in ΔWZX:
- Since WXYZ is a rectangle, ∠WZY is a right angle (90°).
- ∠1 and ∠2 are interior angles of ΔWZX and they form a linear pair with ∠WZY.

Therefore, the measure of angle 2 should be:
\[ m∠2 = 90° - 30° = 60° \]

This means angle 2 measures 60°.

<solution>
The measure of angle 2 is 60°.
