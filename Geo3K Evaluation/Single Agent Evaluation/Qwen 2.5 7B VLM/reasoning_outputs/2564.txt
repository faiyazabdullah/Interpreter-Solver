To find the area of the shaded region, we need to analyze the given geometric figure. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Identify the shapes and their dimensions:**
   - There are two circles with radius \(5 \text{ cm}\).
   - The distance between the centers of the two circles (which forms a line segment connecting points H and A) is \(10 \text{ cm}\).

2. **Calculate the area of the two circles:**
   - The area of one circle is given by the formula \(A = \pi r^2\).
   - For one circle, \(r = 5 \text{ cm}\), so the area is \(A = \pi (5)^2 = 25\pi \text{ cm}^2\).
   - Since there are two circles, the total area of the two circles is \(2 \times 25\pi = 50\pi \text{ cm}^2\).

3. **Calculate the area of the rectangle:**
   - The length of the rectangle is the same as the distance between the centers of the two circles plus twice the diameter of one circle (\(10 + 2 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cm}\)).
   - The width of the rectangle is the diameter of one circle (\(10 \text{ cm}\)).
   - Therefore, the area of the rectangle is \(20 \times 10 = 200 \text{ cm}^2\).

4. **Calculate the area of the shaded region:**
   - The shaded region is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the two circles.
   - So, the shaded area is \(200 - 50\pi\).

5. **Substitute the value of \(\pi\):**
   - Using \(\pi \approx 3.14\), the area of the two circles is approximately \(50 \times 3.14 = 157\).
   - Therefore, the shaded area is approximately \(200 - 157 = 43\).

Since the exact answer is not among the choices, we round it to the nearest tenth.

Comparing with the given choices:
- A. 10.7
- B. 19.6
- C. 30.4
- D. 50.0

The closest answer is C. 30.4.
