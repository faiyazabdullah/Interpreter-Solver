To find \( x \), we need to analyze the given geometric figure and use relevant properties of circles and angles.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - There is a circle with center \( B \).
   - Angle \( \angle GBH = 70^\circ \) is given.
   - We need to find the measure of angle \( \angle JHJ \).

2. **Understand the relationship between the angles:**
   - Since \( H \) and \( J \) are points on the circle and \( G \) is another point on the circle, we can use the fact that the angle subtended by an arc at the circumference is half the angle subtended at the center.
   - However, in this case, we need to consider the cyclic quadrilateral formed by points \( F, G, H, J \) on the circle.

3. **Analyze the cyclic quadrilateral:**
   - In a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of opposite angles is \( 180^\circ \).
   - Therefore, \( \angle GBH + \angle JHJ = 180^\circ \).

4. **Calculate the angle \( \angle JHJ \):**
   - Given \( \angle GBH = 70^\circ \).
   - So, \( \angle JHJ = 180^\circ - 70^\circ = 110^\circ \).

However, this calculation does not match any of the provided answer choices. Let's re-evaluate the problem considering the correct properties and relationships.

Upon re-evaluation, we notice that the correct angle \( x \) should be half of the central angle subtended by the arc \( GJ \). But since the given angle \( \angle GBH = 70^\circ \) is not directly related to \( x \) in the way described, we should reconsider the properties of the circle and the angles involved.

Given the options, the closest reasonable answer based on the properties of the circle and the cyclic quadrilateral is:
