First, let's analyze the given information:

1. Parallelogram A B C D means that opposite sides are equal and parallel.
   - AB = CD = 29 units
   - BC = AD = 3y - 4 units
   - AC = BD = 25 units (diagonals of a parallelogram)

2. The angles given are:
   - ∠BAD = 49°
   - ∠ADC = 34°

3. We need to find m∠CDF.

To solve for m∠CDF, we can use the fact that the sum of angles around point F is 360°. However, since F is the intersection of diagonals in a parallelogram, it creates supplementary angles. 

4. Since ∠ADC = 34°, the supplementary angle at point F will be:
   - 180° - 34° = 146°

Since F is also part of the parallelogram's diagonal intersection, the angle ∠CDF will be half of this supplementary angle because the diagonals bisect each other in a parallelogram.

5. Therefore:
   - m∠CDF = 146° / 2 = 73°

Comparing our calculated result with the answer choices:
- A. 34
- B. 43
- C. 47
- D. 77

The closest answer choice to 73° is D.
