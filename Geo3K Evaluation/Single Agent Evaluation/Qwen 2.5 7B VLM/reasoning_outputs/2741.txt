<think>
First, let's analyze the given geometric figure:
- We have an equilateral pentagon \(PQRST\) inscribed in circle \(\odot U\).
- Since the pentagon is equilateral, all its sides are equal, and all its internal angles are equal.
- The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\), where \(n\) is the number of sides. For a pentagon, \(n=5\), so the sum of the interior angles is \((5-2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ\).
- Since the pentagon is equilateral, each interior angle is \(\frac{540^\circ}{5} = 108^\circ\).

Now, we need to find the measure of \(\angle PSR\). Since \(PQRST\) is a cyclic pentagon (inscribed in a circle), the opposite angles subtended by the same arc are supplementary. Specifically, \(\angle PSR\) is an external angle to the cyclic pentagon at point \(S\).

Given that \(\angle PSR\) is an external angle to the cyclic pentagon at point \(S\), it can be calculated by considering the internal angles of the pentagon. However, since the problem does not provide additional details about the specific arrangement of points or additional angles, we can use the fact that the sum of angles around a point is \(360^\circ\).

Since the pentagon is symmetric and all angles are equal, \(\angle PSR\) can be derived from the internal angle at \(S\) which is \(108^\circ\). The angle \(\angle PSR\) will be the supplement of the internal angle at \(S\) that forms part of the straight line through \(P\) and \(R\).

Thus, \(\angle PSR = 180^\circ - 72^\circ = 144^\circ\).

<solution>
To find \(\angle PSR\):

1. Calculate the sum of the interior angles of the pentagon: \((5-2) \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ\).
2. Each interior angle of the pentagon is \(\frac{540^\circ}{5} = 108^\circ\).
3. The angle \(\angle PSR\) is an external angle to the cyclic pentagon at point \(S\).
4. Since the pentagon is symmetric and all angles are equal, the external angle \(\angle PSR\) is \(144^\circ\).
