Let's analyze the given problem step by step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \(ABCD\) is a rhombus.
   - \(m\angle ABC = 70^\circ\).

2. **Understand the properties of a rhombus:**
   - All sides of a rhombus are equal.
   - The opposite angles of a rhombus are equal.
   - The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.
   - The sum of adjacent angles in a rhombus is \(180^\circ\).

3. **Determine the measure of angle \(ADC\):**
   - Since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, \(\angle ADC = 180^\circ - \angle ABC = 180^\circ - 70^\circ = 110^\circ\).

4. **Analyze triangle \(ADE\):**
   - Triangle \(ADE\) shares the diagonal \(AE\) which is the same as the diagonal \(BD\) of the rhombus.
   - Since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, \(AE\) bisects \(\angle BAD\) and \(\angle BCD\).
   - Therefore, \(\angle ADE = \frac{1}{2} \times 110^\circ = 55^\circ\).

5. **Determine the measure of angle \(1\):**
   - Angle \(1\) is part of triangle \(ADE\).
   - Since the sum of angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\), we can find \(\angle 1\) as follows:
     \[
     \angle 1 = 180^\circ - \angle ADE - \angle AED
     \]
   - We know \(\angle ADE = 55^\circ\). To find \(\angle AED\):
     \[
     \angle AED = \frac{1}{2} \times 70^\circ = 35^\circ
     \]
   - Thus,
     \[
     \angle 1 = 180^\circ - 55^\circ - 35^\circ = 90^\circ
     \]

However, it seems there might be a misunderstanding. Let's re-evaluate the problem focusing on the correct interpretation of the angles formed within the rhombus.

Given the properties of the rhombus and the angle bisector, let's consider the correct angle bisector property again:
- \(\angle 1\) should be half of the supplementary angle of \(\angle ABC\) since \(AE\) bisects \(\angle BAD\) and forms a straight line with \(\angle BCD\).

Thus, the correct calculation should be:
\[
\angle 1 = 180^\circ - \left(90^\circ + 35^\circ\right) = 55^\circ
\]

Therefore, the correct answer is:
