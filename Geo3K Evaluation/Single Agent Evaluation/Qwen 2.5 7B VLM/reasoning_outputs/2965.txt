To find \( x \), we need to use the properties of a triangle, specifically the fact that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. Let's analyze the given lengths:

1. The side lengths are:
   - \( XY = 9x \)
   - \( WX = 4x + 5 \)
   - \( WY = 6x + 3 \)

2. According to the triangle inequality theorem:
   - \( XY + WX > WY \)
   - \( XY + WY > WX \)
   - \( WX + WY > XY \)

Let's apply these inequalities:

1. \( 9x + (4x + 5) > 6x + 3 \)
   Simplify:
   \( 13x + 5 > 6x + 3 \)
   Subtract \( 6x \) from both sides:
   \( 7x + 5 > 3 \)
   Subtract 5 from both sides:
   \( 7x > -2 \)
   Divide by 7:
   \( x > -\frac{2}{7} \)

2. \( 9x + (6x + 3) > 4x + 5 \)
   Simplify:
   \( 15x + 3 > 4x + 5 \)
   Subtract \( 4x \) from both sides:
   \( 11x + 3 > 5 \)
   Subtract 3 from both sides:
   \( 11x > 2 \)
   Divide by 11:
   \( x > \frac{2}{11} \)

3. \( (4x + 5) + (6x + 3) > 9x \)
   Simplify:
   \( 10x + 8 > 9x \)
   Subtract \( 9x \) from both sides:
   \( x + 8 > 0 \)
   Subtract 8 from both sides:
   \( x > -8 \)

From the inequalities, the most restrictive condition is \( x > \frac{2}{11} \).

Now, let's check the given answer choices:
- \( x = 1 \)
- \( x = 3 \)
- \( x = 5 \)
- \( x = 6 \)

Clearly, \( x = 1 \) satisfies \( x > \frac{2}{11} \). Therefore, the closest answer choice is:
