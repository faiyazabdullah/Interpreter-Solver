<think>
First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric relationships in the diagram:

1. We have a triangle labeled as GEF.
2. The angle at G is given as 55 degrees.
3. The problem asks for the value of x, which is the angle at F.

Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees, we can set up the equation for the angles in triangle GEF:

\[ \angle G + \angle E + \angle F = 180^\circ \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 55^\circ + \angle E + \angle F = 180^\circ \]

To find \(\angle F\), we need to determine \(\angle E\). Notice that \(\angle E\) is part of a vertical line that forms a straight line with another line (vertical line passing through G). Since the vertical line passing through G is perpendicular to the horizontal line passing through H, the angle \(\angle E\) must be supplementary to the angle formed by the horizontal line passing through H and the vertical line passing through G.

However, the angle \(\angle E\) is also the same as the angle \(x\) because they are vertically opposite angles formed by the intersection of the horizontal and vertical lines. Therefore, \(\angle E = x\).

So, the equation simplifies to:

\[ 55^\circ + x + x = 180^\circ \]
\[ 55^\circ + 2x = 180^\circ \]
\[ 2x = 180^\circ - 55^\circ \]
\[ 2x = 125^\circ \]
\[ x = 62.5^\circ \]

Since the options provided are whole numbers, we need to reconsider the interpretation. It appears there might be a misinterpretation in the problem setup or the angle \(x\) could be the exterior angle of the triangle, making it supplementary to the interior angle at F. Let's recheck the angles:

If the angle at F is the exterior angle, then:

\[ x = 180^\circ - 55^\circ = 125^\circ \]

This matches one of the provided options.

<solution>
Based on the analysis, the correct value for x is 125 degrees.
