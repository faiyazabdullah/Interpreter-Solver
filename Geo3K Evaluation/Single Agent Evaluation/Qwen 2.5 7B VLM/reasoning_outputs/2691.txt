<think>
To solve for QS, we need to use the fact that the triangle QRST is isosceles because the sides QR and RS are marked as equal (both labeled as \(5x\)). In an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal, but here we only need the lengths of the sides to find QS.

Given:
- QR = 5x
- RS = 6x - 5
- QS = 3x + 10

Since QR = RS, we can set up the equation:
\[5x = 6x - 5\]

Solving for x:
\[5x - 6x = -5\]
\[-x = -5\]
\[x = 5\]

Now substitute \(x = 5\) into the expression for QS:
\[QS = 3x + 10\]
\[QS = 3(5) + 10\]
\[QS = 15 + 10\]
\[QS = 25\]

Thus, the length of QS is 25.
