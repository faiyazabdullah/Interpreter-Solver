To find the measure of angle 3, we need to use the properties of triangles and the given angles. Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify Given Angles and Sides:**
   - Angle at vertex C (angle at point C) is 70°.
   - Angle at vertex A (angle at point A) is 40°.
   - Angle at vertex B (angle at point B) is 45°.

2. **Sum of Angles in a Triangle:**
   The sum of the interior angles in any triangle is always 180°. We can verify this for the triangle ABC:
   \[
   \text{Angle at C} + \text{Angle at A} + \text{Angle at B} = 70° + 40° + 45° = 155°
   \]
   This calculation seems incorrect because the sum should be 180°. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

3. **Re-evaluate Triangle ABC:**
   Since the sum of the angles should be 180°, there might be a misinterpretation of the given angles. However, the key here is to focus on the relationship involving angle 3.

4. **Identify Angle 3:**
   Angle 3 is the angle formed by the intersection of the line segments extending from points B and C, intersecting at point D. This forms a straight line with angle 1 and angle 2.

5. **Calculate Angle 3:**
   Since angle 1 is part of the straight line formed by the extension of BC, it is supplementary to angle 3. Therefore, angle 3 can be found using the following relationship:
   \[
   \text{Angle 3} = 180° - (\text{Angle 1} + \text{Angle 2})
   \]
   Given that angle 1 + angle 2 = 180° - (70° + 40° + 45°) = 180° - 155° = 25°, then:
   \[
   \text{Angle 3} = 180° - 25° = 155°
   \]

6. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   The calculated value of angle 3 is 155°, which does not match any of the given choices A, B, C, or D.

Since none of the provided answers match our calculated result, we need to choose the closest value among the options.
