First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric relationship in the image:

1. We have a triangle ABC and a line segment DE extending beyond BC.
2. The lengths of segments AE, AB, BC, and ED are provided:
   - AE = 3
   - AB = 2
   - BC = 6
   - ED = 2x - 3

We need to find the value of x that satisfies the given lengths.

Since there isn't a direct geometric theorem or property that directly links these segments without additional context (like parallel lines, similar triangles, etc.), we can infer that the lengths are related through some linear relationship or simply through the given equation for ED.

Given that AE + EB = AB, we can use the lengths provided to find a potential value for x.

Let's calculate:
\[ AE + EB = AB \]
\[ 3 + EB = 2 \]

This implies:
\[ EB = 2 - 3 = -1 \]

However, since lengths cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the relationship differently. Instead, we use the given length of ED:
\[ ED = 2x - 3 \]

We know the total length from E to D includes AB and the part EB which we've already considered:
\[ ED = AE + EB = 3 + EB \]

Since we already determined EB = -1 (which is incorrect), let's consider the total length from E to D directly:
\[ ED = AB + BC \]
\[ ED = 2 + 6 \]
\[ ED = 8 \]

Now, equate this to the given expression for ED:
\[ 2x - 3 = 8 \]

Solving for x:
\[ 2x - 3 = 8 \]
\[ 2x = 11 \]
\[ x = \frac{11}{2} \]

Since none of the answer choices match \(\frac{11}{2}\), we need to reconsider the problem constraints and possible misinterpretation of lengths or relationships. Given the choices, let's assume there might be a simpler linear relationship without complex geometric constraints.

Revisiting the choices, we notice:
If \(x = 5\):
\[ ED = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

If \(x = 6\):
\[ ED = 2(6) - 3 = 12 - 3 = 9 \]

If \(x = 8\):
\[ ED = 2(8) - 3 = 16 - 3 = 13 \]

If \(x = 9\):
\[ ED = 2(9) - 3 = 18 - 3 = 15 \]

Given the closest match is 9, we select:
