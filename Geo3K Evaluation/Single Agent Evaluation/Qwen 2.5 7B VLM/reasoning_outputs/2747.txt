To find the area of the figure, we need to determine whether it's a rectangle or a parallelogram and then use the appropriate formula for its area. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Identify the Shape**: The figure appears to be a rectangle because opposite sides are equal, and there are right angles at the corners.

2. **Given Information**:
   - One side length (AB) is 3 inches.
   - The angle between diagonal DN and side AB is 62 degrees.
   
3. **Area Calculation**:
   - For a rectangle, the area \( A \) is given by the formula \( A = l \times w \), where \( l \) is the length and \( w \) is the width.
   - However, we only have the length (3 inches) but not the width directly. We need to infer the width using trigonometry since the diagonal forms a right triangle with the sides of the rectangle.

4. **Using Trigonometry**:
   - The diagonal (DN) forms a right triangle with AB and the unknown width. Using the sine function:
     \[
     \sin(62^\circ) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{3}{\text{width}}
     \]
   - Solving for the width:
     \[
     \text{width} = \frac{3}{\sin(62^\circ)}
     \]

5. **Calculate Width**:
   - Using a calculator:
     \[
     \sin(62^\circ) \approx 0.8829
     \]
     \[
     \text{width} \approx \frac{3}{0.8829} \approx 3.42 \text{ inches}
     \]

6. **Calculate Area**:
   - Now, calculate the area:
     \[
     A = 3 \times 3.42 \approx 10.26 \text{ square inches}
     \]

7. **Rounding to the Nearest Hundredth**:
   - Rounding 10.26 to the nearest hundredth gives us approximately 10.26.

8. **Comparison with Given Choices**:
   - The closest option to 10.26 is not listed among the choices A, B, C, or D.

Since none of the given options match our calculated result, we should select the closest option. Based on the closest match, we select the next lower value, which is 4.8.

Final Answer: B
