Let's analyze the given information and the geometric relationships in the figure:

1. We know that \( m \angle MPL = 65^\circ \).
2. \( NP \perp PL \), meaning \( \angle NPL = 90^\circ \).

Since \(NP\) is perpendicular to \(PL\), we can deduce that triangle \(NPL\) is a right triangle with the right angle at \(P\). Therefore, the sum of the angles in triangle \(NPL\) is \(180^\circ\).

Given:
\[ \angle NPL = 90^\circ \]
\[ \angle MPL = 65^\circ \]

We need to find \(m\widehat{NM}\), which is the measure of the arc \(NM\). For this, we use the fact that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

To find the measure of the arc \(NM\):
\[ m\widehat{NM} = 2 \times m\angle NPL \]

However, since \(NP \perp PL\), the angle \(NPL\) is not directly related to the arc \(NM\). Instead, we need to consider the central angle subtended by the arc \(NM\). Since \(NP\) is perpendicular to \(PL\), the central angle \(NPM\) will be supplementary to the right angle \(NPL\):

\[ \angle NPM = 180^\circ - 90^\circ = 90^\circ \]

Thus, the measure of the arc \(NM\) will be twice the measure of the inscribed angle \(NPL\):
\[ m\widehat{NM} = 2 \times 90^\circ = 180^\circ \]

But this value does not match any of the given answer choices. Given the problem constraints and the closest possible matching option, let's reconsider the simpler relationship involving the inscribed angle and the arc it intercepts.

Since \(NP \perp PL\), the angle \(NPL\) being 90 degrees suggests a simpler geometric relationship. The closest possible matching arc measure would be:
\[ m\widehat{NM} = 90^\circ \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:
