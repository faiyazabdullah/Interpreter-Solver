<think>
First, let's analyze the given geometric figure:

1. The figure shows a straight line segment DE extending infinitely in both directions.
2. There is a point F where a perpendicular line BF intersects the line segment DE at right angles.
3. The angle marked as \( \chi^\circ \) is the angle between the perpendicular line BF and the line segment DE.
4. Since BF is perpendicular to DE, it means that the angle formed between them is 90 degrees.

Given these observations, we can conclude that \( \chi = 90^\circ \).

Now, let's compare this result with the provided answer choices:
A. 45
B. 90
C. 180
D. 360

The closest answer choice to our calculated value is B.

Final Answer: B</think>
<solution>
Since the angle \( \chi \) is 90 degrees and the closest answer choice to 90 degrees is B, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B</solution>
