QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:

<think>
First, let's analyze the geometric figure provided:

1. **Identify Shapes**: The figure appears to be composed of multiple triangles and rectangles.
2. **Given Information**: We have the lengths of certain sides:
   - Side \(EC = 14 \text{ ft}\)
   - Side \(EA = 9 \text{ ft}\)

Since \(EC\) and \(EA\) form a right angle (as indicated by the perpendicular lines), we can recognize that triangle \(EAC\) is a right triangle with legs \(EA\) and \(EC\).

3. **Calculate Area of Triangle EAC**:
   - The area of a right triangle is given by the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]
   - Here, the base \(EA = 9 \text{ ft}\) and height \(EC = 14 \text{ ft}\).
   \[
   \text{Area of } \triangle EAC = \frac{1}{2} \times 9 \times 14 = \frac{1}{2} \times 126 = 63 \text{ square feet}
   \]

4. **Examine Remaining Parts**:
   - The rest of the figure includes more triangles and possibly other geometric shapes, but the problem seems to focus on the area of the entire figure.
   - Given the complexity of the figure, it suggests the total area might be the sum of the areas of the individual parts, but the provided data only gives us the area of triangle \(EAC\).

Based on the given information and the analysis, the area of the figure is primarily the area of triangle \(EAC\), which is 63 square feet.

<solution>
The area of the figure is approximately 63 square feet. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
