To solve this problem, let's analyze the given information and the geometric relationships in the figure:

1. We are given the lengths:
   - \( S T = 8 \)
   - \( T R = 4 \)
   - \( P T = 6 \)

2. The task is to find the length \( Q R \).

3. Observing the figure, it appears that points \( P, Q, R, S, T \) form a pentagon. However, there are no direct relationships between these points that immediately suggest a specific geometric theorem or property to apply.

4. Since the problem does not provide any additional information about the angles or the nature of the connections (whether they are sides of polygons, segments of circles, etc.), we must rely on the given side lengths directly.

5. Given that we have three distinct lengths (\( S T, T R, P T \)) and none of them directly lead to determining \( Q R \) without more context or additional information, we need to consider the possibility of a misinterpretation or missing information in the problem setup.

6. If we assume the figure forms a specific geometric shape where these lengths are connected in a way that allows us to infer \( Q R \), but since no such relationship is explicitly stated, we must conclude that the problem might be incomplete or incorrectly structured for a straightforward solution using only the given lengths.

Given the lack of additional information or a clear geometric relationship that would allow us to calculate \( Q R \), we must rely on the provided answer choices.

Since none of the given lengths (\( S T, T R, P T \)) can directly help us determine \( Q R \) without additional context, we must select the closest possible answer among the provided choices.

Considering the lengths given:
- \( S T = 8 \)
- \( T R = 4 \)
- \( P T = 6 \)

The closest plausible length for \( Q R \) that fits within the range of these values is 8.

Thus, the most reasonable answer choice is:
