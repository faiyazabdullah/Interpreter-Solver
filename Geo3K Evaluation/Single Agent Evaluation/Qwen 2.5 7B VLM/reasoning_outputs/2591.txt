To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the shapes and their properties:**
   - We have a regular pentagon with vertices labeled A, B, C, D, and E.
   - We also have a square with vertices labeled Y and Z.
   - The side XY and XZ are part of a third polygon, which we need to determine.

2. **Analyze the pentagon and square:**
   - A regular pentagon has interior angles of 108 degrees each.
   - A square has interior angles of 90 degrees each.

3. **Determine the angle at point X:**
   - Since XY and XZ are sides of different polygons, the angle at point X is the sum of the angles formed by the square and the pentagon.
   - The angle between adjacent sides of a regular pentagon is 108 degrees.
   - The angle between adjacent sides of a square is 90 degrees.
   - Therefore, the angle at X is \(180^\circ - (108^\circ + 90^\circ) = 180^\circ - 198^\circ\), but since it's a reflex angle, it is actually \(360^\circ - 198^\circ = 162^\circ\).

4. **Determine the polygon type:**
   - The angle at X is 162 degrees, which means the polygon formed by XY and XZ is a polygon whose internal angles sum up to \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\) where n is the number of sides.
   - Since the angle at X is part of the polygon, we can use the formula for the interior angle of a regular polygon: \(\frac{(n-2) \times 180^\circ}{n}\).
   - Setting this equal to 162 degrees, we get: \(\frac{(n-2) \times 180^\circ}{n} = 162^\circ\).
   - Solving for n: \((n-2) \times 180 = 162n \Rightarrow 180n - 360 = 162n \Rightarrow 18n = 360 \Rightarrow n = 20\).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The polygon has 20 sides.
