To find the length of \(\widehat{JK}\), we need to use the properties of the circle and the given angle.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The radius of the circle is \(2\) ft.
   - The angle \(\angle JCK = 30^\circ\).

2. **Understand the geometric relationships:**
   - Since \(J\) and \(K\) lie on the circumference of the circle, \(JC\) and \(KC\) are radii of the circle, making them equal in length.
   - The line segment \(JK\) is a chord of the circle.

3. **Use the Inscribed Angle Theorem:**
   - The inscribed angle theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts.
   - Here, \(\angle JCK\) is an inscribed angle, and it intercepts the arc \(\widehat{JK}\).

4. **Calculate the length of the chord \(JK\):**
   - The formula for the length of a chord in a circle is given by:
     \[
     JK = 2R \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
     \]
   - Where \(R\) is the radius of the circle and \(\theta\) is the central angle subtended by the arc.
   - Here, \(\theta = 2 \times 30^\circ = 60^\circ\).

5. **Substitute the values:**
   - \(R = 2\) ft
   - \(\theta = 60^\circ\)
   - \[
     JK = 2 \times 2 \times \sin\left(\frac{60^\circ}{2}\right) = 4 \times \sin(30^\circ)
   \]

6. **Calculate \(\sin(30^\circ)\):**
   - \(\sin(30^\circ) = 0.5\)

7. **Final calculation:**
   - \[
     JK = 4 \times 0.5 = 2 \times 0.5 = 1.00
   \]

Since the calculated length \(JK\) is \(1.00\) ft, we round it to the nearest hundredth, which is \(1.00\). However, the closest option among the choices is \(1.05\).
