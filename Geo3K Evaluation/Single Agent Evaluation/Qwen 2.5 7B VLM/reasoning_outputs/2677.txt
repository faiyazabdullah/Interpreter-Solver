To solve this problem, let's follow these steps:

1. **Examine the Geometric Figure**:
   - The figure is a pentagon (a five-sided polygon).
   - All sides appear to be equal in length, suggesting it might be a regular pentagon.
   - The perimeter of the pentagon is given as 60 centimeters.

2. **Identify Given Information**:
   - Perimeter of the pentagon = 60 cm.
   - A regular pentagon has five equal sides.

3. **Understand What Needs to Be Found**:
   - We need to find the length of one side of the pentagon.

4. **Apply Relevant Geometric Theorem**:
   - For a regular polygon, the perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.
   - If we denote the length of each side as \( s \), then for a regular pentagon, the perimeter is \( 5s \).

5. **Set Up the Equation**:
   - Given the perimeter \( P = 60 \) cm, we have:
     \[
     5s = 60
     \]

6. **Solve for \( s \)**:
   - Divide both sides by 5:
     \[
     s = \frac{60}{5} = 12
     \]

7. **Compare with Given Answer Choices**:
   - The calculated side length \( s = 12 \) cm matches choice A.

Final Answer: A
