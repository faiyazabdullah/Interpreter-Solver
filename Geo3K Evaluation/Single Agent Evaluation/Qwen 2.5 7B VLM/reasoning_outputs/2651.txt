Let's analyze the given information and the geometric relationships in the diagram:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is inscribed in circle \(\odot Z\).
   - \(m \angle BZA = 104^\circ\).
   - \(m \widehat{CB} = 94^\circ\).
   - \(AB \parallel DC\).

2. **Understand the relationships:**
   - Since \(AB \parallel DC\), quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is an isosceles trapezoid (or a cyclic quadrilateral with parallel sides).
   - The angle at the center corresponding to arc \(CB\) is \(94^\circ\). Therefore, the arc \(AB\) can be calculated as \(360^\circ - 94^\circ = 266^\circ\).

3. **Find the measure of \(\angle ZAC\):**
   - Since \(ABCD\) is cyclic, the opposite angles sum up to \(180^\circ\).
   - The angle subtended by arc \(AB\) at point \(Z\) is \(133^\circ\) (since the angle at the circumference is half the angle at the center for the same arc).
   - The angle \(\angle BZA\) is given as \(104^\circ\). This means the angle \(\angle ZAB\) can be found using the fact that the sum of angles around point \(Z\) is \(360^\circ\).

4. **Calculate \(\angle ZAC\):**
   - Since \(\angle BZA = 104^\circ\) and considering the cyclic nature, we need to find the internal angles of the triangle formed by points \(A\), \(C\), and \(Z\).
   - The angle \(\angle ZAC\) can be derived from the properties of the cyclic quadrilateral and the parallel lines.

5. **Revisit the angle relationships:**
   - Given the symmetry and properties of the cyclic quadrilateral, the angle \(\angle ZAC\) should be derived from the given data and properties of cyclic quadrilaterals.

Based on these steps, the calculated value for \(\angle ZAC\) aligns with the closest option provided.

<solution>
To find \(\angle ZAC\):

Given:
- \(AB \parallel DC\)
- \(m \angle BZA = 104^\circ\)
- \(m \widehat{CB} = 94^\circ\)

Since \(ABCD\) is cyclic and \(AB \parallel DC\), the angles subtended by the arcs will help us determine \(\angle ZAC\).

From the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals:
- \(\angle BZA = 104^\circ\)
- The angle subtended by arc \(CB\) at point \(Z\) is \(94^\circ\).

Using the fact that the sum of angles around point \(Z\) is \(360^\circ\):
\[ \angle ZAC = 360^\circ - \angle BZA - \text{angle subtended by arc } AB \]

Since \(\angle BZA = 104^\circ\) and the angle subtended by arc \(AB\) is \(133^\circ\):
\[ \angle ZAC = 180^\circ - \frac{\text{arc } AB}{2} = 180^\circ - 133^\circ = 47^\circ \]

However, the closest match among the given options is:
\[ \boxed{B} \]
