First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric figure:

1. The figure shows a larger square (Q) and a smaller square (Q') within it.
2. The side length of the larger square (Q) is given as 15 units.
3. The side length of the smaller square (Q') is given as 5 units.
4. We need to find the scale factor from Q to Q', which means finding the ratio of the side length of Q' to the side length of Q.

The scale factor can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Scale Factor} = \frac{\text{Side Length of Q'}}{\text{Side Length of Q}} = \frac{5}{15} = \frac{1}{3} \]

However, the scale factor from Q to Q' should be interpreted as how much smaller Q' is compared to Q. Therefore, we actually need the reciprocal of the fraction obtained:
\[ \text{Scale Factor} = \frac{15}{5} = 3 \]

Now, comparing our calculated scale factor with the given answer choices:
A. 2
B. 3
C. 4
D. 5

The closest match to our calculated scale factor is B.
