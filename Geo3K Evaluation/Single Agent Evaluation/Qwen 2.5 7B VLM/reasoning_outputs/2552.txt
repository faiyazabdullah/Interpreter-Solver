To determine which segments are parallel, we need to analyze the given angles and the geometric relationships within the figure.

1. **Identify Angles and Relationships:**
   - Angle at point \(D\) is \(40^\circ\).
   - Angle at point \(E\) is \(80^\circ\).
   - Angle at point \(B\) is \(70^\circ\).

2. **Sum of Angles in a Triangle:**
   - The sum of angles in a triangle is always \(180^\circ\).

3. **Calculate Missing Angles:**
   - For triangle \(ABE\):
     - Angle at \(A\) is \(60^\circ\).
     - Angle at \(E\) is \(80^\circ\).
     - Angle at \(B\) is \(70^\circ\).
     - Therefore, angle at \(A\) (which is \(60^\circ\)) plus angle at \(E\) (which is \(80^\circ\)) plus angle at \(B\) (which is \(70^\circ\)) equals \(210^\circ\), which is incorrect because it exceeds \(180^\circ\). Thus, there might be a misinterpretation here.

4. **Parallel Segments:**
   - We need to check for parallel segments by comparing the angles formed between the lines.
   - Since the angles do not form a straight line or supplementary pairs directly, we need to consider the external angles and the transversals.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the angles and the configuration, we can see that segment \(AD\) forms a right angle with segment \(DC\), suggesting that \(AD\) is perpendicular to \(DC\).
   - However, we need to identify parallel segments.

After re-evaluating the angles and relationships, the correct identification of parallel segments is:
