First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric figure:

1. Circle A has diameters DF and PG.
2. The length of diameter DF is given as 10 units.
3. We need to find the length DA.

Since DF is a diameter of the circle, it passes through the center of the circle. Therefore, DF is twice the radius of the circle. Given that DF = 10, we can determine the radius of the circle.

\[ \text{Radius} = \frac{\text{Diameter}}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Next, we need to find the length DA. Since A is the center of the circle, and DA is a radius of the circle, the length DA is equal to the radius.

Thus, DA = 5.

Now, let's compare this result with the given answer choices:
A. 5
B. 10
C. 20
D. 25

The closest answer to our calculated result of 5 is option A.
