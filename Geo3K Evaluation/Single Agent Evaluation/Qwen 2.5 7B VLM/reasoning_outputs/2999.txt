First, let's analyze the given geometric figure:

1. The square ABCD is circumscribed around the circle.
2. The side length of the square is given as 14 yards.
3. We need to find the circumference of the circle.

To solve this, we need to use the relationship between the side length of the square and the diameter of the circle. Since the square is circumscribed around the circle, the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square.

Step 1: Calculate the diameter of the circle.
The diameter \(d\) of the circle is equal to the side length of the square.
\[ d = 14 \text{ yd} \]

Step 2: Calculate the radius of the circle.
The radius \(r\) of the circle is half of the diameter.
\[ r = \frac{d}{2} = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ yd} \]

Step 3: Calculate the circumference of the circle.
The formula for the circumference \(C\) of a circle is \(C = 2\pi r\).
\[ C = 2\pi \times 7 = 14\pi \]

Now, let's compare our calculated circumference with the given answer choices:
A. \(7\pi\)
B. \(14\pi\)
C. \(21\pi\)
D. \(28\pi\)

Our calculated circumference is \(14\pi\), which matches option B.

Final Answer: B
