First, let's analyze the geometric figure:

1. The figure is a regular polygon, which means all sides and angles are equal.
2. The given side length is 6 cm.
3. The central angle formed by two consecutive vertices of the polygon is divided into smaller angles around the center.

Since it's a regular polygon, we can divide it into multiple equilateral triangles by drawing lines from the center to each vertex.

Next, let's calculate the area of one of these equilateral triangles:
- The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle with side length \( s \) is \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times s^2 \).
- Here, \( s = 6 \) cm.

Now, let's calculate the area of one equilateral triangle:
\[ \text{Area of one triangle} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 6^2 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 36 = 9\sqrt{3} \]

Since the polygon is made up of 6 such triangles (as a hexagon has 6 sides), the total area of the polygon is:
\[ \text{Total Area} = 6 \times 9\sqrt{3} = 54\sqrt{3} \]

Finally, let's approximate the value:
\[ 54\sqrt{3} \approx 54 \times 1.732 = 93.132 \]

Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 12.7
- B. 25.5
- C. 101.8
- D. 203.6

The closest value is C. 101.8.
