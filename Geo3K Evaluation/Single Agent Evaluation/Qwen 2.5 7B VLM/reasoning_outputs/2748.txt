To determine which fact is sufficient to prove that line \(d\) is parallel to \(XZ\), we need to use the properties of corresponding angles and alternate interior angles. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Identify the given angles**:
   - \(\angle 1\)
   - \(\angle 2\)
   - \(\angle 3\)

2. **Understand the goal**:
   We need to find which angle, when equal to another specific angle, will prove that \(d\) is parallel to \(XZ\).

3. **Analyze each option**:
   - **Option A**: \(\angle 1 \cong \angle 3\)
     - If \(\angle 1 \cong \angle 3\), it suggests that these angles are corresponding angles. For line \(d\) to be parallel to \(XZ\), \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 3\) must be corresponding angles formed by a transversal intersecting two parallel lines.
   - **Option B**: \(\angle 1 \cong \angle Z\)
     - If \(\angle 1 \cong \angle Z\), these angles are alternate interior angles. For line \(d\) to be parallel to \(XZ\), \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle Z\) must be alternate interior angles.
   - **Option C**: \(\angle 2 \cong \angle X\)
     - If \(\angle 2 \cong \angle X\), these angles are alternate interior angles. For line \(d\) to be parallel to \(XZ\), \(\angle 2\) and \(\angle X\) must be alternate interior angles.
   - **Option D**: \(\angle 3 \cong \angle Z\)
     - If \(\angle 3 \cong \angle Z\), these angles are corresponding angles. For line \(d\) to be parallel to \(XZ\), \(\angle 3\) and \(\angle Z\) must be corresponding angles.

4. **Determine the correct choice**:
   - From the properties of corresponding angles and alternate interior angles, \(\angle 1 \cong \angle Z\) or \(\angle 3 \cong \angle Z\) would be sufficient to prove that \(d\) is parallel to \(XZ\). However, since \(\angle Z\) is an angle at point \(Z\) and not directly related to \(\angle 1\) or \(\angle 3\) without additional context, the most direct and straightforward proof would be using \(\angle 1 \cong \angle Z\).
