To find the measure of JK, we need to use the information provided in the diagram and apply relevant geometric principles.

1. **Identify Given Information:**
   - The lengths of sides JL and JK are expressed in terms of \( x \): \( JL = 9x - 5 \) and \( JK = 6x + 7 \).
   - The problem asks for the measure of JK.

2. **Understand the Relationship:**
   - Since the lengths of JL and JK are given as functions of \( x \), we can set up an equation to find \( x \).
   - We need to determine if there's any geometric relationship (like a triangle property or a straight line condition) that can help us solve for \( x \).

3. **Analyze the Figure:**
   - The diagram appears to show a triangle with vertices J, K, and L.
   - The lengths of the sides suggest that these could be part of a specific type of triangle, but without additional angles or relationships, we need to focus on solving for \( x \) first.

4. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - If the lengths are equal when considering a specific geometric configuration (like a parallelogram or a special triangle), we can equate the expressions for the sides:
     \[
     9x - 5 = 6x + 7
     \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   9x - 5 = 6x + 7 \\
   9x - 6x = 7 + 5 \\
   3x = 12 \\
   x = 4
   \]

6. **Substitute \( x \) Back to Find JK:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) into the expression for JK:
     \[
     JK = 6x + 7 = 6(4) + 7 = 24 + 7 = 31
     \]

Based on the calculation, the measure of JK is 31.

**Solution:**
The measure of JK is 31.
