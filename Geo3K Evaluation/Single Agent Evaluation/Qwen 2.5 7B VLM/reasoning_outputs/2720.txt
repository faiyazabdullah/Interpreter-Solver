Let's analyze the given geometric figures:

1. Rectangle L M N P
2. Parallelogram L K M J

From the rectangle L M N P:
- L N is the length of the rectangle.
- L J and P J are segments within the rectangle and parallelogram.

Given:
- L N = 10
- L J = 2x + 1
- P J = 3x - 1

We need to find the value of x.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Relationships**:
   Since L J and P J are segments within the same rectangle and parallelogram, we can use the property of parallelograms that opposite sides are equal.

2. **Set Up Equations**:
   Since L J and P J are segments within the rectangle and parallelogram, and they are part of the same geometric structure, we can equate their expressions:
   \[
   L J = P J
   \]
   Substituting the given expressions:
   \[
   2x + 1 = 3x - 1
   \]

3. **Solve for x**:
   \[
   2x + 1 = 3x - 1
   \]
   Subtract 2x from both sides:
   \[
   1 = x - 1
   \]
   Add 1 to both sides:
   \[
   x = 2
   \]

### Verification:
- Check the values:
  - If \( x = 2 \):
    \[
    L J = 2(2) + 1 = 5
    \]
    \[
    P J = 3(2) - 1 = 5
    \]
  Both expressions equal 5, which satisfies the condition.

### Conclusion:
The value of x is 2.
