<think>
First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric figure:

1. We have a triangle labeled ABC.
2. Angle BAC is 60 degrees.
3. The length BC (opposite to angle BAC) is given as 4 units.
4. We need to find the length AB (which we will call h).

Since angle BAC is 60 degrees, and triangle ABC is a right triangle (as indicated by the right angle at C), we can use trigonometric relationships to solve for AB.

In a right triangle, the sine function relates the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Here, the opposite side to angle BAC is BC, and the hypotenuse is AB (h). Therefore, we can write:
\[ \sin(60^\circ) = \frac{BC}{AB} \]

We know that:
\[ \sin(60^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{4}{h} \]

To find h, we solve for h:
\[ h = \frac{4 \times 2}{\sqrt{3}} \]
\[ h = \frac{8}{\sqrt{3}} \]
\[ h = \frac{8\sqrt{3}}{3} \]

Now, let's approximate the value:
\[ h \approx \frac{8 \times 1.732}{3} \]
\[ h \approx \frac{13.856}{3} \]
\[ h \approx 4.62 \]

Comparing with the given answer choices:
A. 4.62
B. 5.66
C. 6.93
D. 8

The closest value to our calculated result is 4.62.

Final Answer: A</think>

<Solution>
The length AB (h) is approximately 4.62. Comparing this with the given answer choices, the closest value is:

Final Answer: A
