<think>
Let's analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the given angles:**
   - Angle RST = 51°
   - Angle RUS = 92°

2. **Understand the relationship between these angles:**
   - These angles appear to be inscribed angles in a circle. Inscribed angles are half of their intercepted arcs.

3. **Determine the intercepted arcs:**
   - Since angle RST intercepts arc RS, and angle RUS intercepts arc RU.
   - We need to find the measure of angle 4, which is related to the intercepted arc RTU.

4. **Calculate the arc measures:**
   - Arc RS = Intercepted by angle RST = 2 * 51° = 102°
   - Arc RU = Intercepted by angle RUS = 2 * 92° = 184°

5. **Find the measure of arc RTU:**
   - Total arc measure around the circle = 360°
   - Arc RTU = Total arc measure - Arc RS - Arc RU
   - Arc RTU = 360° - 102° - 184° = 74°

6. **Relate arc RTU to angle 4:**
   - Angle 4 intercepts arc RTU, so it is half of arc RTU.
   - Therefore, angle 4 = 74° / 2 = 37°

7. **Compare with the given choices:**
   - None of the choices match 37° exactly, but we need to choose the closest option.
   - The closest option to 37° among the given choices is 35.5° (which is not listed, but considering the closest value).

Since none of the choices match the exact calculation, we select the closest one.

</think>

<solution>
The closest choice to our calculated value is B. 67.5°.
