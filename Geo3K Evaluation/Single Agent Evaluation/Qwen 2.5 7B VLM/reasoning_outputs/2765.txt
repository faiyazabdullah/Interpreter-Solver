To solve this problem, let's analyze the given geometric figure:

1. The figure shows a parallelogram \(ABCD\) and a line segment \(BB'\) that seems to represent a dilation or enlargement of \(AB\).
2. The length of \(AB\) is given as 6 units.
3. The length of \(BB'\) is given as 8 units.
4. We need to find the scale factor from \(B\) to \(B'\).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Scale Factor**:
   - The scale factor is the ratio of the lengths of corresponding sides after dilation.
   - Here, we need to compare the lengths of \(BB'\) and \(AB\).

2. **Calculate the Scale Factor**:
   - The length of \(AB\) is 6 units.
   - The length of \(BB'\) is 8 units.
   - The scale factor \(x\) can be calculated as:
     \[
     x = \frac{\text{length of } BB'}{\text{length of } AB} = \frac{8}{6}
     \]

3. **Simplify the Scale Factor**:
   - Simplify the fraction \(\frac{8}{6}\):
     \[
     \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3}
     \]

### Conclusion:
The scale factor from \(B\) to \(B'\) is \(\frac{4}{3}\).

### Solution Section:

The scale factor from \(B\) to \(B'\) is \(\frac{4}{3}\). Comparing this with the given answer choices, we see that it matches option D.
