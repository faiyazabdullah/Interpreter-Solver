Let's analyze the geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the shapes and measurements:**
   - The figure includes a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with vertices at \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
   - There is a right angle at \( D \), which lies on line segment \( AB \).
   - The length of \( CD \) is given as 8 units.
   - The length of \( AD \) is given as 16 units.

2. **Understand the relationship:**
   - Since \( \angle CDA = 90^\circ \), \( \triangle CDA \) is a right triangle.
   - We need to find the hypotenuse \( AC \).

3. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem:**
   - The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (\( c \)) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (\( a \) and \( b \)).
   - Here, \( a = CD = 8 \) and \( b = AD = 16 \).
   - Therefore, we have:
     \[
     AC^2 = CD^2 + AD^2
     \]
     \[
     AC^2 = 8^2 + 16^2
     \]
     \[
     AC^2 = 64 + 256
     \]
     \[
     AC^2 = 320
     \]
     \[
     AC = \sqrt{320}
     \]
     \[
     AC = \sqrt{64 \times 5}
     \]
     \[
     AC = 8\sqrt{5}
     \]

4. **Determine \( y \):**
   - The problem asks for the value of \( y \), which appears to be the length of the hypotenuse \( AC \).
   - From our calculation, \( AC = 8\sqrt{5} \).

5. **Compare with answer choices:**
   - The closest match to \( 8\sqrt{5} \) among the given options is \( 16\sqrt{5} \).

Based on the analysis, the closest match to our calculated result is \( 16\sqrt{5} \).
