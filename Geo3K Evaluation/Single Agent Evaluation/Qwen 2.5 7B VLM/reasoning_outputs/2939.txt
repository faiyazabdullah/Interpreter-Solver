QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:

<think>
Let's analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - There is a triangle with one angle labeled as 60°.
   - The hypotenuse of the triangle is 18 units long.
   - One of the legs (let's call it 'x') is the side we need to find.
   - The other leg is labeled 'y'.

2. **Understand the geometric relationship:**
   - Since one angle is 60°, the triangle is a right triangle because the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°.
   - Therefore, the third angle must be 90° - 60° = 30°.

3. **Apply trigonometric properties:**
   - In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides have specific ratios:
     - The side opposite the 30° angle is half the hypotenuse.
     - The side opposite the 60° angle is √3 times the side opposite the 30° angle.
   - Here, the hypotenuse is 18, so the side opposite the 30° angle (which is 'x') would be half of 18 divided by √3.

4. **Calculate 'x':**
   - The side opposite the 30° angle is \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \).
   - However, since the side opposite the 60° angle is √3 times the side opposite the 30° angle, we can confirm:
     - \( x = \frac{18}{\sqrt{3}} = 6\sqrt{3} \).

5. **Revisit the problem:**
   - The calculation seems incorrect as the problem states the side opposite the 30° angle should be directly half of the hypotenuse.

6. **Correct interpretation:**
   - The side opposite the 30° angle should be directly half of the hypotenuse.
   - Thus, \( x = 9 \).

</think>

<solution>
Based on the correct interpretation, the value of \( x \) is 9.
