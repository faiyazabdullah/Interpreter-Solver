First, let's analyze the given image:

1. The figure consists of a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle.
2. The radius of the circle is given as 10 cm.
3. We need to find the area of the shaded region formed by the circle and the regular hexagon.

To find the area of the shaded region, we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the Area of the Circle
The formula for the area of a circle is:
\[ \text{Area of the circle} = \pi r^2 \]
Given \( r = 10 \) cm:
\[ \text{Area of the circle} = \pi \times 10^2 = 100\pi \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Area of the Regular Hexagon
A regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles. The side length of each triangle is equal to the radius of the circle (10 cm).

The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle is:
\[ \text{Area of one equilateral triangle} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \]
Given \( s = 10 \) cm:
\[ \text{Area of one equilateral triangle} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times 10^2 = 25\sqrt{3} \]

Since there are 6 such triangles in the hexagon:
\[ \text{Area of the hexagon} = 6 \times 25\sqrt{3} = 150\sqrt{3} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Shaded Region Area
The shaded region is the area of the circle minus the area of the hexagon:
\[ \text{Area of the shaded region} = \text{Area of the circle} - \text{Area of the hexagon} \]
\[ \text{Area of the shaded region} = 100\pi - 150\sqrt{3} \]

### Step 4: Approximate Values
Using the approximate values:
\[ \pi \approx 3.14 \]
\[ \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \]

Now, calculate:
\[ 100\pi \approx 100 \times 3.14 = 314.0 \]
\[ 150\sqrt{3} \approx 150 \times 1.732 = 259.8 \]

So:
\[ \text{Area of the shaded region} \approx 314.0 - 259.8 = 54.2 \]

### Step 5: Compare with Given Choices
The calculated value is approximately 54.2, which is closest to 54.2 among the given choices.

Given the closest option:
