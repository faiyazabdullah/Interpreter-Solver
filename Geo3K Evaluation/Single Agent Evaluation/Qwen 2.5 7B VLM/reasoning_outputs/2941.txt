To determine the measure of a central angle in the given square \(ABCD\) inscribed in circle \(\odot K\), we need to analyze the geometric relationships and properties involved.

1. **Identify the Properties of the Square and Circle:**
   - The square \(ABCD\) is inscribed in the circle \(\odot K\).
   - The center of the circle \(\odot K\) is also the center of the square \(ABCD\).

2. **Central Angle Definition:**
   - A central angle is the angle formed by two radii of a circle.
   - In this case, we need to find the measure of a central angle subtended by one side of the square.

3. **Analyze the Square and Circle Relationship:**
   - Since the square is inscribed in the circle, each vertex of the square touches the circumference of the circle.
   - The diagonal of the square is the diameter of the circle because it passes through the center of the circle.

4. **Calculate the Central Angle:**
   - The square divides the circle into four equal parts because it is symmetrically placed within the circle.
   - Therefore, the central angle corresponding to one side of the square (which is a quarter of the circle) is:
     \[
     \frac{360^\circ}{4} = 90^\circ
     \]

Based on the analysis, the measure of the central angle is \(90^\circ\).

</think>

**Solution:**
The measure of the central angle is \(90^\circ\).
