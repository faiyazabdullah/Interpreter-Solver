Let's analyze the given geometric figure:

1. The figure is a parallelogram labeled ABCD.
2. The length of side AB (or CD) is given as 3.2 meters.
3. There are no other dimensions explicitly given for height or base lengths, but we can assume the height perpendicular to AB (or CD) is the same as the side length due to symmetry or lack of information suggesting otherwise.

Given these observations:
- We need to find the area of the parallelogram.
- The formula for the area of a parallelogram is: \( \text{Area} = \text{base} \times \text{height} \).
- Here, the base is 3.2 meters, and since there is no specific height mentioned, we can assume the height is also 3.2 meters.

Now let's calculate the area:
\[ \text{Area} = 3.2 \times 3.2 = 10.24 \]

Since we need to round to the nearest tenth:
\[ 10.24 \approx 10.2 \]

Comparing this with the given answer choices:
A. 9
B. 9.6
C. 10.2
D. 10.8

The closest value to 10.24 is 10.2.
