<think>
First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric relationships:

1. We have a triangle ABC where angle A is 60 degrees.
2. The side AB is given as 10 units long.
3. The side BC is labeled as y, but we need to find the length of AC, which is labeled as x.
4. Since angle A is 60 degrees, triangle ABC is a special type of triangle known as a 30-60-90 triangle. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : âˆš3 : 2, where the side opposite the 30-degree angle is the shortest, the side opposite the 60-degree angle is the middle-length side, and the hypotenuse is the longest side.

Given that AB is the hypotenuse and measures 10 units, we can use the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle to find the length of AC (which is the side opposite the 30-degree angle).

In a 30-60-90 triangle:
- Hypotenuse = 2 * Length of the side opposite the 30-degree angle.

Let's denote the side opposite the 30-degree angle as 'a'. Then:
\[ \text{Hypotenuse} = 2a \]
\[ 10 = 2a \]
\[ a = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

So, AC (x) is the side opposite the 30-degree angle, which is 5 units long.

Now, let's verify if this matches any of the given answer choices:
- A. 5
- B. \( 5\sqrt{2} \)
- C. \( 5\sqrt{3} \)
- D. 10

Clearly, the calculated value of x is 5, which matches option A.

Final Answer: A</think>

<sol>
To find x, we recognize that triangle ABC is a 30-60-90 triangle with AB as the hypotenuse equal to 10 units. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the side opposite the 30-degree angle is half the hypotenuse. Therefore, the length of AC (x) is:

\[ x = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Thus, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: A</sol>
