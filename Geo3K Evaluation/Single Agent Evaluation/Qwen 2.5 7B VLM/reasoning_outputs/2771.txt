To solve for \( x \) in the given trapezoid, we need to use the property that the sum of the lengths of the bases (the parallel sides) of a trapezoid is equal to the sum of the lengths of the non-parallel sides. This property can be stated as:

\[ \text{Length of base}_1 + \text{Length of base}_2 = \text{Length of side}_1 + \text{Length of side}_2 \]

From the image, we have:
- Length of base 1 (AD): \( 10x - 2 \)
- Length of base 2 (BC): \( 5x + 10 \)
- Length of side 1 (CD): \( 6x + 4 \)
- Length of side 2 (BE): \( 5x + 10 \)

According to the trapezoid property:
\[ (10x - 2) + (5x + 10) = (6x + 4) + (5x + 10) \]

Let's simplify and solve for \( x \):

1. Combine like terms on both sides:
   \[ 10x - 2 + 5x + 10 = 6x + 4 + 5x + 10 \]
   \[ 15x + 8 = 11x + 14 \]

2. Subtract \( 11x \) from both sides:
   \[ 15x - 11x + 8 = 14 \]
   \[ 4x + 8 = 14 \]

3. Subtract 8 from both sides:
   \[ 4x = 6 \]

4. Divide both sides by 4:
   \[ x = \frac{6}{4} \]
   \[ x = 1.5 \]

Since none of the answer choices match 1.5, we need to round to the nearest tenth. Therefore, the closest answer choice is:

Final Answer: A
