Let's analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \( GJ \) is a diameter of \( \odot K \).
   - The measure of arc \( GH \) is given as \( 122^\circ \).

2. **Understand the relationship between the arc and the central angle:**
   - Since \( GJ \) is the diameter, it divides the circle into two semicircles.
   - The total measure of the circle is \( 360^\circ \).

3. **Calculate the measure of arc \( GH \):**
   - The measure of arc \( GH \) is given as \( 122^\circ \).

4. **Find the measure of the remaining arc \( HJ \):**
   - The sum of the measures of arcs \( GH \) and \( HJ \) must be equal to the measure of the circle.
   - Therefore, the measure of arc \( HJ \) is:
     \[
     360^\circ - 122^\circ = 238^\circ
     \]

5. **Determine the measure of arc \( GLJ \):**
   - Arc \( GLJ \) includes arcs \( GH \), \( HJ \), and \( GKJ \).
   - Since \( GKJ \) is a semicircle (as \( GJ \) is the diameter), its measure is \( 180^\circ \).
   - Therefore, the measure of arc \( GLJ \) is:
     \[
     122^\circ + 238^\circ + 180^\circ = 540^\circ - 360^\circ = 180^\circ
     \]

Based on the above analysis, the measure of arc \( GLJ \) is \( 180^\circ \).

<solution>
The measure of arc \( GLJ \) is \( 180^\circ \).
