To solve for \(x\) in the given problem, we need to analyze the geometric relationships and use the properties of circles and angles.

1. **Identify the given information and relationships:**
   - \(GH \cong KJ\): This means the lengths of segments \(GH\) and \(KJ\) are equal.
   - \(\angle G = 83^\circ\).
   - \(\angle K = (2x - 27)^\circ\).

2. **Understand the angle relationship:**
   - Since \(GH \cong KJ\), the arcs \(GH\) and \(KJ\) are equal, which implies the central angles subtending these arcs are also equal.
   - Therefore, the measure of \(\angle G\) should be equal to the measure of \(\angle K\).

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - Given \(\angle G = 83^\circ\), we set \(\angle K = 83^\circ\).
   - So, we have:
     \[
     2x - 27 = 83
     \]

4. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - Add 27 to both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x - 27 + 27 = 83 + 27
     \]
     \[
     2x = 110
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     x = \frac{110}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 55
     \]

</think>

The calculated value of \(x\) is 55. Comparing this with the given answer choices:

- A. 27
- B. 54
- C. 55
- D. 83

The closest answer choice to our calculated value is C. 55.
