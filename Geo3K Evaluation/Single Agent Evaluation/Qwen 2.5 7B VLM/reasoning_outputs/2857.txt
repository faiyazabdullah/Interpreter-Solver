To find GH in the kite, let's analyze the given information and use geometric properties.

1. The kite FGJH has a diagonal FG = 12 and another diagonal FJ = 15.
2. The diagonals of a kite are perpendicular bisectors of each other. This means they intersect at right angles (90 degrees) and divide each other into two equal parts.
3. Let's denote the intersection point as A. Therefore, FA = AG = 6 and JA = AJ = 7.5.
4. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, triangle FAJ forms a right triangle with right angle at A.
5. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of FH:
   \[
   FH^2 = FA^2 + AJ^2
   \]
   \[
   FH^2 = 6^2 + 7.5^2
   \]
   \[
   FH^2 = 36 + 56.25
   \]
   \[
   FH^2 = 92.25
   \]
   \[
   FH = \sqrt{92.25} = 9.61 \approx 10
   \]

6. Since GH is parallel to FH and the triangles formed by the diagonals are congruent, GH = FH â‰ˆ 10.

Given the answer choices:
A. 12
B. 15
C. \( 11\sqrt{3} \)
D. \( \sqrt{369} \)

The closest value to our calculated approximation is approximately 10, which matches the length of GH.

Final Answer: B</think>
