<think>
Let's analyze the given geometric figure:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - There is a triangle ABC.
   - Angle C is a right angle (90 degrees).
   - Side AC = 24 units.
   - Side AB = y units.
   - Side BC = x units.
   - Angle B is 30 degrees.

2. **Understand the relationships:**
   - Since angle C is 90 degrees, triangle ABC is a right triangle with AC as one leg and BC as the other leg.
   - The angle at B is 30 degrees, making it part of a special right triangle known as a 30-60-90 triangle.

3. **Properties of a 30-60-90 triangle:**
   - In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio \(1 : \sqrt{3} : 2\).
   - The hypotenuse (the side opposite the 90-degree angle) is twice the length of the shorter leg.
   - The longer leg (opposite the 60-degree angle) is \(\sqrt{3}\) times the length of the shorter leg.

4. **Apply the properties to find x:**
   - Here, AC is the shorter leg (24 units).
   - Therefore, BC (the longer leg) will be \(24 \times \sqrt{3} = 24\sqrt{3}\).

Thus, x = \(24\sqrt{3}\).

</think>

Solution:
Based on the analysis, the value of x is \(24\sqrt{3}\).
