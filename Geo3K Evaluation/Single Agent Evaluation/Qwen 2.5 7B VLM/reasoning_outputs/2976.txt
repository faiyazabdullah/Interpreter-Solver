To find the measure of \(\angle 2\), we need to analyze the given information and use geometric properties and theorems. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the given angles and lines**:
   - \(\angle 1 = 32^\circ\) (given).
   - \(\angle 2\) is the angle we need to find.
   - \(\angle 3\) is the angle formed at point \(B\) between the horizontal line \(CE\) and the line segment \(BD\).

2. **Understand the relationship between the angles**:
   - Since \(CE\) is a straight line, the sum of the angles around point \(B\) must be \(180^\circ\). Therefore, \(\angle 1 + \angle 2 + \angle 3 = 180^\circ\).

3. **Use the given angle \(\angle 1\)**:
   - We know \(\angle 1 = 32^\circ\).

4. **Determine \(\angle 3\)**:
   - \(\angle 3\) is part of a triangle with \(\angle 2\) and another angle which we can calculate using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\).

5. **Calculate \(\angle 2\)**:
   - Let's assume the triangle formed by points \(B\), \(D\), and the intersection point of the lines is a right triangle for simplicity (since no specific type of triangle is indicated).
   - If we assume \(\angle 3\) is supplementary to \(\angle 1\) in the context of a straight line, then \(\angle 3 = 180^\circ - 32^\circ = 148^\circ\).

6. **Summarize the calculation**:
   - From the equation \(\angle 1 + \angle 2 + \angle 3 = 180^\circ\):
     \[
     32^\circ + \angle 2 + 148^\circ = 180^\circ
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     \angle 2 = 180^\circ - 32^\circ - 148^\circ = 4^\circ
     \]

Since none of the given answer choices match our calculated value of \(4^\circ\), we need to re-evaluate the problem. Given the choices provided, we should check if there's a simpler approach or a misinterpretation of the problem.

Upon re-evaluating the problem, it seems that the angle \(\angle 2\) might be part of a simpler linear relationship without involving complex triangles. Given the choices, the closest angle that fits the problem's constraints is \(33^\circ\).

Therefore, the closest match among the given options is:
