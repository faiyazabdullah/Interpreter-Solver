To solve for \( m \widehat{QR} \) in the given equilateral pentagon \( PQRSU \) inscribed in circle \( \odot U \), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify Key Properties**:
   - Since \( PQRSU \) is an equilateral pentagon, each side is equal in length.
   - All interior angles of a regular pentagon are equal. However, since it's equilateral, the central angles subtended by the sides are also equal.

2. **Calculate Central Angles**:
   - An equilateral pentagon can be divided into five congruent isosceles triangles by connecting the center of the circle to each vertex.
   - The total angle around the center of the circle is \(360^\circ\).
   - Therefore, the measure of the central angle subtended by each side of the pentagon is:
     \[
     \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
     \]

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Since \( QR \) is one of the sides of the pentagon, the arc \( \widehat{QR} \) subtends an angle of \(72^\circ\) at the center.

Based on the above reasoning, the measure of the arc \( \widehat{QR} \) is \(72^\circ\).
