To find the circumference of the circle in the given image, we need to use the formula for the circumference of a circle, which is \( C = \pi d \), where \( d \) is the diameter of the circle.

From the image, we can see that the diameter of the circle is given as 6.2 cm.

Let's proceed with the calculation:

1. Identify the given diameter: \( d = 6.2 \) cm.
2. Substitute the value of the diameter into the formula: \( C = \pi \times 6.2 \).
3. Calculate the circumference: \( C = \pi \times 6.2 \approx 19.5 \) (since \(\pi \approx 3.14\)).

Now, let's compare our calculated result with the given answer choices:
- A. 18.6
- B. 19.5
- C. 37.7
- D. 39.0

Our calculated circumference is approximately 19.5 cm, which matches option B.
