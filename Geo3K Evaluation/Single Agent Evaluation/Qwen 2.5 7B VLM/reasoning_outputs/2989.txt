QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to determine the side length \( x \) of the smaller diamond given the area of the larger diamond and the side length of the smaller diamond.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Given Information:**
   - The area of the larger diamond (\(A_1\)) is 400 mm².
   - The side length of the larger diamond (\(d_1\)) is 40 mm.
   - The area of the smaller diamond (\(A_2\)) is 64 mm².
   - We need to find the side length (\(x\)) of the smaller diamond.

2. **Understand Similarity:**
   Since the two diamonds are similar, the ratio of their corresponding side lengths is equal to the square root of the ratio of their areas.

3. **Set Up the Proportion:**
   Let's denote the side length of the smaller diamond as \(x\).
   The ratio of the side lengths is the same as the ratio of the square roots of the areas.
   \[
   \frac{x}{40} = \sqrt{\frac{64}{400}}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Ratio of Areas:**
   \[
   \frac{64}{400} = \left(\frac{8}{20}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{4}{10}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^2
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   \sqrt{\frac{64}{400}} = \frac{2}{5}
   \]

5. **Set Up the Equation:**
   \[
   \frac{x}{40} = \frac{2}{5}
   \]

6. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   x = 40 \times \frac{2}{5} = 40 \times 0.4 = 16
   \]

### Final Answer:
After calculating, the side length \( x \) of the smaller diamond is 16 mm.

Final Answer: B
