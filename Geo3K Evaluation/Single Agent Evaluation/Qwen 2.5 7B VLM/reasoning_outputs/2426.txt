To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of similar figures. Specifically, the ratio of the areas of two similar figures is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths.

Given:
- The area of the smaller rectangle (left) is 8 square inches.
- The area of the larger rectangle (right) is 32 square inches.
- The side length of the smaller rectangle is 4 inches.

Let's denote the unknown side length of the larger rectangle as \(x\) inches.

Step 1: Set up the proportion for the areas.
\[
\frac{\text{Area of larger rectangle}}{\text{Area of smaller rectangle}} = \left(\frac{x}{4}\right)^2
\]

Step 2: Substitute the given areas into the equation.
\[
\frac{32}{8} = \left(\frac{x}{4}\right)^2
\]

Step 3: Simplify the left side of the equation.
\[
4 = \left(\frac{x}{4}\right)^2
\]

Step 4: Solve for \(x\).
\[
4 = \frac{x^2}{16}
\]

Multiply both sides by 16 to isolate \(x^2\).
\[
64 = x^2
\]

Take the square root of both sides.
\[
x = 8
\]

Thus, the value of \(x\) is 8 inches.
