Let's analyze the given problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - We have a circle \(\odot S\).
   - The measure of the arc \(PQR\) is given as \(98^\circ\).
   - We need to find the measure of the arc \(PQ\).

2. **Understand the relationship between the arcs:**
   - The total measure of the circle is \(360^\circ\).
   - Arc \(PQR\) includes both arc \(PQ\) and arc \(QR\), which together form a semicircle.

3. **Determine the measure of arc \(QR\):**
   - Since arc \(PQR\) is \(98^\circ\) and it forms a semicircle, we can calculate the measure of arc \(QR\) as follows:
     \[
     \text{Measure of arc } QR = \frac{360^\circ - 98^\circ}{2} = \frac{262^\circ}{2} = 131^\circ
     \]

4. **Calculate the measure of arc \(PQ\):**
   - The measure of arc \(PQ\) is simply the difference between the measure of arc \(PQR\) and arc \(QR\):
     \[
     \text{Measure of arc } PQ = 98^\circ - 131^\circ + \text{measure of arc } QR
     \]
   - However, since arc \(PQ\) is part of the semicircle, its measure must be less than \(180^\circ\). Thus, we directly use the given arc \(PQR\) minus the arc \(QR\) which forms part of the semicircle:
     \[
     \text{Measure of arc } PQ = 98^\circ - (98^\circ - 131^\circ) = 98^\circ - 49^\circ = 49^\circ
     \]

</think>

<solution>
Based on the analysis, the measure of arc \(PQ\) is \(49^\circ\).
