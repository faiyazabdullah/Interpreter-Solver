To find the area of the shaded region, let's analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the Geometric Figure**: The figure appears to be a circle with a sector and a triangle inscribed within it. The triangle is a right triangle because it includes a 30-degree angle, which is a characteristic of a 30-60-90 triangle when inscribed in a circle.

2. **Given Information**:
   - The radius of the circle (OB) is 5 units.
   - The central angle of the sector is 30 degrees.
   - The triangle OAB is a right triangle with ∠AOB = 30°.

3. **Properties of a 30-60-90 Triangle**:
   - In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio \(1 : \sqrt{3} : 2\).
   - The hypotenuse (AB) is the longest side, which is twice the length of the shortest side.
   - The middle side is \(\sqrt{3}\) times the shortest side.

4. **Calculate the Lengths of the Sides**:
   - Let the shortest side (opposite the 30° angle) be \(x\).
   - Then the middle side (opposite the 60° angle) is \(x\sqrt{3}\).
   - The hypotenuse (AB) is \(2x\).

5. **Using the Given Radius**:
   - Since OB is the radius and is also one of the sides of the triangle, we have \(OB = AB = 5\).
   - Therefore, \(2x = 5 \Rightarrow x = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5\).

6. **Calculate the Area of the Sector**:
   - The area of a sector is given by \(\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi r^2\), where \(\theta\) is the central angle in degrees and \(r\) is the radius.
   - Here, \(\theta = 30^\circ\) and \(r = 5\).
   - Area of the sector = \(\frac{30^\circ}{360^\circ} \times \pi \times 5^2 = \frac{1}{12} \times \pi \times 25 = \frac{25\pi}{12}\).

7. **Calculate the Area of the Triangle OAB**:
   - The area of a right triangle is \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\).
   - Here, the base and height are both 2.5 (since AB = 5, and the legs of the triangle are equal).
   - Area of the triangle = \(\frac{1}{2} \times 2.5 \times 2.5 = \frac{1}{2} \times 6.25 = 3.125\).

8. **Calculate the Shaded Area**:
   - The shaded area is the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle.
   - Shaded area = \(\frac{25\pi}{12} - 3.125\).

9. **Evaluate the Shaded Area**:
   - Using \(\pi \approx 3.14\):
     \[
     \frac{25 \times 3.14}{12} \approx \frac{78.5}{12} \approx 6.5417
     \]
     \[
     6.5417 - 3.125 \approx 3.4167
     \]

10. **Comparison with Answer Choices**:
    - The closest value among the given choices is approximately 3.4167, which does not match any of the choices directly.
    - However, we need to select the closest answer choice.

Given the closest match, the answer is:
