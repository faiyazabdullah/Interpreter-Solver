QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
<think> First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric relationships in the circle:

1. We know that \( F L = 24 \) and \( H J = 48 \).
2. The measure of arc \(\widehat{H P}\) is given as 65 degrees.
3. We need to find the measure of arc \(\widehat{H J}\).

Since the total measure of the circle is 360 degrees, we can use the fact that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts. However, here we are dealing with arcs directly, so we will use the relationship between the arcs and the central angles they intercept.

Let's denote the measure of arc \(\widehat{H J}\) as \(x\).

Given:
- Arc \(\widehat{H J} = x\)
- Arc \(\widehat{H P} = 65^\circ\)

Since the total measure of the circle is 360 degrees, we have:
\[ \text{Arc } \widehat{H J} + \text{Arc } \widehat{P J} = 360^\circ - \text{Arc } \widehat{H P} \]
\[ x + (360^\circ - 65^\circ) = 360^\circ \]
\[ x + 295^\circ = 360^\circ \]
\[ x = 360^\circ - 295^\circ \]
\[ x = 65^\circ \]

However, this calculation seems incorrect because the problem suggests that the measure of arc \(\widehat{H J}\) should be larger than the given arc \(\widehat{H P}\). Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct approach:

Given the correct interpretation, the measure of arc \(\widehat{H J}\) should be the sum of the arc \(\widehat{H P}\) and the arc \(\widehat{P J}\), which is:
\[ \text{Arc } \widehat{H J} = 360^\circ - 65^\circ = 360^\circ - 65^\circ = 295^\circ \]

But since the problem asks for the measure of arc \(\widehat{H J}\) directly, and considering the options, the correct interpretation should be:
\[ \text{Arc } \widehat{H J} = 130^\circ \]

Thus, the correct answer is:
