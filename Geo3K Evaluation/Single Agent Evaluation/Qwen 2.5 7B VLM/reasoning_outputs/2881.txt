Let's analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is shown.
   - \( G \) is the incenter of \( \triangle ABC \).
   - \( AD = 12 \) and \( DC = 13 \).

2. **Understand the properties of the incenter:**
   - The incenter is the point where the angle bisectors of a triangle intersect.
   - It is equidistant from all sides of the triangle.

3. **Determine the length \( EG \):**
   - Since \( G \) is the incenter, it lies on the angle bisector of \( \angle BAC \).
   - We need to find the length of segment \( EG \), which is the distance from the incenter to the side \( AB \).

4. **Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem:**
   - The Angle Bisector Theorem states that the incenter divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides.
   - Here, \( AD = 12 \) and \( DC = 13 \). Therefore, the ratio of \( AD \) to \( DC \) is \( \frac{12}{13} \).

5. **Calculate the length \( EG \):**
   - Since \( G \) is the incenter, \( EG \) is the perpendicular distance from \( G \) to \( AB \).
   - Using the properties of the incenter and the given lengths, we can infer that \( EG \) is the harmonic mean between the segments created by the incenter on the opposite side.

Given the options:
- \( AD = 12 \)
- \( DC = 13 \)

We need to find the value of \( EG \). By the properties of the incenter and the given lengths, we can infer that \( EG \) is the average of these lengths, which is approximately \( 5 \).

Thus, the length \( EG \) is closest to \( 5 \).

<solution>
Based on the analysis and the properties of the incenter, the length \( EG \) is approximately \( 5 \).
