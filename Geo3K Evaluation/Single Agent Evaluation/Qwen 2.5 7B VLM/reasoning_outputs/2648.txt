<think> "Thought section"

Let's analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - There is a circle with center \( O \).
   - Points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), \( D \), and \( E \) are marked on the circle.
   - An angle at point \( A \) measures \( 67^\circ \).
   - Another angle, denoted as \( x \), is formed at point \( O \).

2. **Understand the relationships:**
   - Since \( A \) is a point on the circle, \( OA \) is a radius.
   - The line segment \( AB \) is a chord of the circle.
   - The angle \( x \) is subtended by the chord \( AB \) at the center \( O \).

3. **Apply geometric theorems:**
   - The angle subtended by a chord at the center of a circle is twice the angle subtended by the same chord at any point on the remaining part of the circle.
   - Therefore, \( x = 2 \times 67^\circ \).

4. **Calculate the value of \( x \):**
   - \( x = 2 \times 67^\circ = 134^\circ \).

5. **Compare with the answer choices:**
   - The calculated value \( 134^\circ \) does not match any of the given choices.
   - However, we need to select the closest option from the choices provided.

6. **Select the closest answer:**
   - The closest answer to \( 134^\circ \) among the choices is \( 130^\circ \), which is not available.
   - The next closest value is \( 135^\circ \), which is not available either.
   - The closest value among the choices is \( 130^\circ \), but it is not available.
   - Therefore, we must select the closest available value, which is \( 130^\circ \).

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The closest available value among the choices is \( 130^\circ \), which is not available.
   - However, the closest answer choice that matches our calculated value is \( 90^\circ \), which is not available either.
   - The closest answer choice that matches our calculated value is \( 67^\circ \).
