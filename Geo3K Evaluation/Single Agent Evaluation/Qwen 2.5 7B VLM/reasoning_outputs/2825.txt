To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and use geometric properties related to circles and inscribed angles.

1. **Given Information:**
   - \( JK = 10 \)
   - \(\widehat{JKL} = 134^\circ\)

2. **What to Find:**
   - We need to find \( m\widehat{JL} \).

3. **Geometric Properties:**
   - In a circle, the measure of an arc is equal to twice the measure of the inscribed angle that subtends it.
   - The sum of the measures of arcs \( JK \) and \( JL \) is \( 360^\circ \).
   - Since \( JK \) is a straight line segment, the arc \( JK \) can be considered as \( 180^\circ \).

4. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - Let's denote the measure of arc \( JL \) as \( x \).
   - Given that \( \widehat{JKL} = 134^\circ \), the inscribed angle that subtends arc \( JL \) is half of \( \widehat{JKL} \).
     \[
     \text{Measure of arc } JL = 2 \times \left( \frac{134^\circ}{2} \right) = 134^\circ
     \]
   - However, this value exceeds the possible range for an arc (which cannot be greater than 180 degrees). Therefore, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the given data.

5. **Re-evaluation:**
   - The correct interpretation should be that the inscribed angle \( \widehat{JKL} \) subtends arc \( JK \) which is 180 degrees minus the arc \( JL \).
   - Therefore, the correct calculation should be:
     \[
     x = 360^\circ - 134^\circ = 226^\circ
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The correct measure of arc \( JL \) should be:
     \[
     m\widehat{JL} = 360^\circ - 134^\circ = 226^\circ
     \]

Since the provided answer choices do not include 226 degrees, we need to select the closest value among the given options.
