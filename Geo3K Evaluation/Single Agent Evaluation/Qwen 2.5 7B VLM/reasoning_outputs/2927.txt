To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of similar figures. Since trapezoid J K L M is similar to trapezoid Q R S T, the ratio of their areas is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths.

Given:
- Area of trapezoid J K L M = 138 square feet
- Area of trapezoid Q R S T = 5.52 square feet
- Trapezoid J K L M âˆ¼ Trapezoid Q R S T

Let's denote the length of segment JK (base of trapezoid J K L M) as \( b_1 = 5 \) ft. We need to find the length of segment RS (base of trapezoid Q R S T), which we will denote as \( b_2 = x \).

Since the areas are proportional to the squares of the corresponding side lengths, we can set up the following proportion:

\[
\frac{\text{Area of trapezoid J K L M}}{\text{Area of trapezoid Q R S T}} = \left( \frac{b_1}{b_2} \right)^2
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\frac{138}{5.52} = \left( \frac{5}{x} \right)^2
\]

First, calculate the left-hand side:

\[
\frac{138}{5.52} \approx 25
\]

So we have:

\[
25 = \left( \frac{5}{x} \right)^2
\]

Taking the square root of both sides:

\[
5 = \frac{5}{x}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
5x = 5 \implies x = 1
\]

Therefore, the value of \( x \) is 1.
