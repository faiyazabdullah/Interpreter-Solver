Let's start by analyzing the given geometric figure:

1. We have a circle inscribed in a triangle, touching it at points \(D\), \(E\), and \(F\).
2. The lengths of the sides of the triangle are given as follows:
   - Side \(AB = 41\)
   - Side \(AC = 72 - 3x\)
   - Side \(BC = 39\)

Since the circle is inscribed, the tangents from a point outside the circle are equal. Therefore, we can set up the following relationships for the tangents from the vertices to the points of tangency:
- \(CD = CE\)
- \(AD = AF\)
- \(BD = BE\)

Given these relationships, we can express the side lengths in terms of the variables and known values:
- \(CD + DB = CB = 39\)
- \(CE + EA = AC = 72 - 3x\)
- \(AF + FB = AB = 41\)

From these, we know:
\[ CD + DB = 39 \]
\[ CD = CE \]
\[ CE + EA = 72 - 3x \]
\[ AF + FB = 41 \]
\[ AF = AD \]

Now, let's use the fact that the tangents from a point outside a circle are equal. Thus, we can write:
\[ CD = CE \]
\[ AD = AF \]
\[ BD = BE \]

Since \(CD\) and \(CE\) are tangents from the same point \(C\) to the circle, we have:
\[ CD = CE \]
Similarly,
\[ AD = AF \]
and
\[ BD = BE \]

We need to find the value of \(x\) that satisfies the given conditions. Let's consider the perimeter of the triangle:
\[ AB + BC + CA = 41 + 39 + (72 - 3x) \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 41 + 39 + 72 - 3x = 152 - 3x \]

We also know that the total length of the tangents from each vertex to the points of tangency must sum up to the perimeter minus the radius of the inscribed circle:
\[ CD + DB = 39 \]
\[ CE + EA = 72 - 3x \]
\[ AF + FB = 41 \]

By solving the equation step-by-step and considering the symmetry and the given values, we can determine the value of \(x\).

Let's assume \(x = 20\):
\[ 72 - 3(20) = 72 - 60 = 12 \]

Thus, substituting \(x = 20\):
\[ AB + BC + CA = 41 + 39 + 12 = 92 \]

This value does not match the perimeter directly, so let's verify with \(x = 30\):
\[ 72 - 3(30) = 72 - 90 = -18 \]

Clearly, this does not make sense, so let's try \(x = 10\):
\[ 72 - 3(10) = 72 - 30 = 42 \]

Thus, substituting \(x = 10\):
\[ AB + BC + CA = 41 + 39 + 42 = 122 \]

Finally, verifying the correct value of \(x\):

Final Answer: B
