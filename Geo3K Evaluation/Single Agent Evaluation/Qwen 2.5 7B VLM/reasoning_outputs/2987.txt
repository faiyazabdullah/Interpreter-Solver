Let's analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify Key Elements**: The figure shows a circle with a chord \( AB \) and a perpendicular from the center \( K \) to the chord \( AB \). The length of the perpendicular \( KC \) is given as 5 units, and the distance from the center \( K \) to the point \( A \) on the chord \( AB \) is labeled as \( x \).

2. **Understand the Geometry**: The perpendicular from the center of the circle to the chord bisects the chord. Therefore, \( AC = CB \) (since \( AB \) is bisected at \( C \)).

3. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**: Since \( KC \) is perpendicular to \( AB \), triangle \( KCA \) forms a right triangle with \( KC \) as one leg, \( CA \) as the other leg, and \( KA \) as the hypotenuse. We can write the Pythagorean theorem for this right triangle:
   \[
   KA^2 = KC^2 + CA^2
   \]
   Given \( KC = 5 \) and \( CA = CB \), we need to find \( AB \).

4. **Calculate \( CA \)**: Since \( KA = x \), we have:
   \[
   x^2 = 5^2 + CA^2
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   x^2 = 25 + CA^2
   \]

5. **Determine \( AB \)**: Since \( AB = 2 \times CA \):
   \[
   AB = 2 \times CA
   \]

6. **Solve for \( CA \)**: From the equation \( x^2 = 25 + CA^2 \), we solve for \( CA \):
   \[
   CA = \sqrt{x^2 - 25}
   \]

7. **Substitute \( CA \) into \( AB \)**:
   \[
   AB = 2 \times \sqrt{x^2 - 25}
   \]

Since the exact value of \( x \) is not provided, we cannot calculate a numerical value for \( AB \). However, we know that the length of \( AB \) is dependent on \( x \). Given the choices provided, we need to determine which option matches the calculated length of \( AB \).

Since the problem does not specify the value of \( x \), let's assume the simplest scenario where \( x \) is chosen such that the calculated \( AB \) matches one of the given choices. 

Given the choices:
A. 4
B. 8
C. 12
D. 16

Assuming \( x = 5 \) (which simplifies our calculation):
\[
AB = 2 \times \sqrt{5^2 - 5^2} = 2 \times \sqrt{0} = 0 \quad (\text{This is incorrect})
\]

Let's assume \( x = 6 \):
\[
AB = 2 \times \sqrt{6^2 - 5^2} = 2 \times \sqrt{36 - 25} = 2 \times \sqrt{11} \approx 7.21 \quad (\text{This is incorrect})
\]

Given the choices, the closest possible value seems to be 12 when \( x = 8 \):
\[
AB = 2 \times \sqrt{8^2 - 5^2} = 2 \times \sqrt{64 - 25} = 2 \times \sqrt{39} \approx 12
\]

Thus, the closest match to the calculated length is 12.
