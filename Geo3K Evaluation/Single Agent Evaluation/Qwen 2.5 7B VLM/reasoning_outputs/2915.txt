Let's analyze the given problem step by step:

1. **Identify the key elements**: The figure shows a circle \(\odot O\) with diameters \(EC\) and \(AB\). The angles \(\angle BOD\), \(\angle DOE\), \(\angle EOF\), and \(\angle FOA\) are equal.
   
2. **Understand the relationship between the angles**: Since \(E\), \(O\), and \(F\) are points on the circle, and these angles are given to be congruent, we can infer that each angle is part of the circle's total measure around point \(O\).

3. **Calculate the measure of each angle**: Since there are four congruent angles around point \(O\) (which is the center of the circle), each angle measures \(\frac{360^\circ}{4} = 90^\circ\).

4. **Determine the measure of arc \(\widehat{AD}\)**: The measure of arc \(\widehat{AD}\) is related to the central angle \(\angle AOD\). Since \(\angle AOD\) is composed of two parts (\(\angle AOE\) and \(\angle EOD\)), and each of these parts is \(90^\circ\), the total angle \(\angle AOD\) is \(90^\circ + 90^\circ = 180^\circ\).

5. **Conclusion**: The measure of arc \(\widehat{AD}\) is \(180^\circ\).

<solution>
Based on the analysis, the measure of arc \(\widehat{AD}\) is \(180^\circ\).
