QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of \(x\) such that \(BE\) and \(AD\) are perpendicular. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
- We are given that \(BE \perp AD\).
- This means that the angle between \(BE\) and \(AD\) is \(90^\circ\).
- We are also given two angles in terms of \(x\): \(6x^\circ\) and \(3x^\circ\).

### Step 2: Setting Up the Equation
Since \(BE\) and \(AD\) are perpendicular, the sum of the angles formed by the intersection of these lines at point \(F\) must be \(90^\circ\). Therefore, we can write:
\[6x + 3x = 90\]

### Step 3: Solving for \(x\)
Combine like terms:
\[9x = 90\]
Divide both sides by 9:
\[x = 10\]

### Step 4: Verifying the Solution
We have determined that \(x = 10\). Let's verify this by checking the angles:
- If \(x = 10\), then \(6x = 60^\circ\) and \(3x = 30^\circ\).
- These angles sum up to \(90^\circ\), confirming that \(BE \perp AD\).

### Step 5: Comparing with Answer Choices
The calculated value of \(x\) is 10. Comparing this with the given answer choices:
A. 5
B. 10
C. 20
D. 30

The closest value to 10 is B.

### Final Answer: B
