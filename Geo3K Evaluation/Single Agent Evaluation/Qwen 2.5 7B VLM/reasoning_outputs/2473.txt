Let's analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The lengths of sides AD and DC are expressed as expressions involving \(x\): \(AD = 6x + 2\) and \(DC = 8\).
   - The length of side BC is given as \(10\).
   - The length of side AB is expressed as \(9x - 2\).

2. **Understand the relationships:**
   - Since points A, B, and C form a triangle (AB, BC, AC), we can use the fact that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.

3. **Apply the triangle inequality theorem:**
   - For triangle ABC, the inequalities must hold:
     \[
     AB + BC > AC \\
     AB + AC > BC \\
     BC + AC > AB
     \]

4. **Substitute the given values into these inequalities:**
   - Let's check each inequality:
     \[
     (9x - 2) + 10 > 6x + 2 + 8 \\
     (9x - 2) + (6x + 2) > 10 + 8 \\
     10 + 8 > 9x - 2
     \]

5. **Simplify each inequality:**
   - Simplifying the first inequality:
     \[
     9x - 2 + 10 > 6x + 10 \\
     9x + 8 > 6x + 10 \\
     9x - 6x > 10 - 8 \\
     3x > 2 \\
     x > \frac{2}{3}
     \]
   - Simplifying the second inequality:
     \[
     9x - 2 + 6x + 2 > 10 + 8 \\
     15x > 18 \\
     x > \frac{18}{15} \\
     x > \frac{6}{5}
     \]
   - Simplifying the third inequality:
     \[
     10 + 8 > 9x - 2 \\
     18 > 9x - 2 \\
     18 + 2 > 9x \\
     20 > 9x \\
     x < \frac{20}{9}
     \]

6. **Combine the inequalities:**
   - From the inequalities, we get:
     \[
     x > \frac{6}{5} \quad \text{and} \quad x < \frac{20}{9}
     \]

7. **Check the provided answer choices:**
   - The possible values for \(x\) must lie between \(\frac{6}{5}\) and \(\frac{20}{9}\):
     \[
     \frac{6}{5} \approx 1.2 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{20}{9} \approx 2.22
     \]

8. **Identify the closest value among the answer choices:**
   - The closest value to \(\frac{6}{5}\) is 1.2, which corresponds to choice B (4).

Based on the analysis, the closest value to \(\frac{6}{5}\) is 4.

Final Answer: B</think>
