To find the value of \(x\), we need to analyze the given geometric figure and use the provided equations involving \(x\).

1. **Identify the given equations:**
   - The first equation is \(2x + 3\).
   - The second equation is \(6 - x\).
   - The third equation is \(\frac{4}{3}y + 1\).
   - The fourth equation is \(2y\).

2. **Understand the relationships:**
   - The problem likely involves solving these equations for \(x\) and \(y\).

3. **Set up the system of equations:**
   - We have two variables \(x\) and \(y\), but only one equation directly involving \(x\). The other equations involve \(y\).

4. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - From the first equation \(2x + 3\), we can set it equal to the second equation \(6 - x\):
     \[
     2x + 3 = 6 - x
     \]
   - Rearrange the equation to isolate \(x\):
     \[
     2x + x = 6 - 3
     \]
     \[
     3x = 3
     \]
     \[
     x = 1
     \]

5. **Verify the solution:**
   - Substitute \(x = 1\) into the original equations:
     - First equation: \(2(1) + 3 = 5\)
     - Second equation: \(6 - 1 = 5\)
     Both sides match, confirming the solution is correct.

Based on the analysis, the value of \(x\) is 1.
