QUESTION:
In the figure, m \angle 9 = 75. Find the measure of \angle 6.

CHOICES:
A. 75
B. 85
C. 95
D. 105

<think>
To solve this problem, let's analyze the given information and the geometric relationships in the figure:

1. We know that \( m\angle 9 = 75^\circ \).
2. Angle 9 appears to be part of a straight line with angle 10, which means they form a supplementary pair.
3. Since supplementary angles add up to \(180^\circ\), we can find the measure of angle 10:
   \[
   m\angle 10 = 180^\circ - m\angle 9 = 180^\circ - 75^\circ = 105^\circ
   \]
4. Angle 10 and angle 6 appear to be vertically opposite angles because they are formed by the intersection of two lines. Vertically opposite angles are equal in measure.
5. Therefore, \( m\angle 6 = m\angle 10 \).

Based on the above reasoning, the measure of angle 6 is \(105^\circ\).

Now, let's compare this result with the given answer choices:
A. 75
B. 85
C. 95
D. 105

The closest match to our calculated result is \(105^\circ\).

Final Answer: D</think>

<solution>
1. Identify that angle 9 and angle 10 form a supplementary pair.
2. Calculate the measure of angle 10:
   \[
   m\angle 10 = 180^\circ - 75^\circ = 105^\circ
   \]
3. Since angle 10 and angle 6 are vertically opposite angles, they are equal in measure.
4. Therefore, \( m\angle 6 = 105^\circ \).

Final Answer: D</solution>
