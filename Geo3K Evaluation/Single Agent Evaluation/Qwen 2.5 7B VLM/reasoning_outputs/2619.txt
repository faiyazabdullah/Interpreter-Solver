Let's analyze the given geometric figure:

1. Quadrilateral EFGH is a rectangle.
2. The diagonal FK is given as 32 feet.
3. We need to find the length of EG.

Since EFGH is a rectangle, it has the following properties:
- Opposite sides are equal.
- All interior angles are right angles (90 degrees).
- The diagonals bisect each other.

Given that FK is the diagonal, it splits the rectangle into two congruent right triangles (EKF and GHK).

In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal in length. Therefore, EF = HG and FG = EH.

Since FK is the diagonal, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle EKF:

\[ FK^2 = EF^2 + EG^2 \]

We know that \( FK = 32 \) feet, so:

\[ 32^2 = EF^2 + EG^2 \]
\[ 1024 = EF^2 + EG^2 \]

However, since we don't have the exact lengths of EF or EG, we need to consider the properties of the rectangle. Given that the diagonals bisect each other, and assuming symmetry, we can infer that EF and EG are equal in length because they are opposite sides of the rectangle.

Thus, let's assume \( EF = x \) and \( EG = x \). Then:

\[ 32^2 = x^2 + x^2 \]
\[ 1024 = 2x^2 \]
\[ x^2 = \frac{1024}{2} \]
\[ x^2 = 512 \]
\[ x = \sqrt{512} \]
\[ x = 16\sqrt{2} \]

This value does not match any of the provided answer choices directly. However, we should check the closest value among the choices.

Revisiting the problem, since we assumed symmetry and the properties of the rectangle, let's test the closest value:

If we consider the closest integer value, 32 feet for the diagonal, which seems incorrect but closest to our derived value, we can conclude:
