To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of similar triangles and the concept of medians in triangles.

1. **Identify Similar Triangles**: The triangles \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle DEF\) are similar (\(\triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF\)). This means their corresponding sides are proportional.

2. **Median Properties**: The median in a triangle divides it into two triangles of equal area. For similar triangles, the ratio of the lengths of the medians is the same as the ratio of the lengths of the corresponding sides.

3. **Given Information**:
   - \(BC = 30\)
   - \(BG = 15\) (median of \(\triangle ABC\))
   - \(EF = 15\)

4. **Find the Ratio of Corresponding Sides**:
   Since \(\triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF\), the ratio of the sides is the same as the ratio of the medians.

   \[
   \frac{BG}{EG} = \frac{BC}{EF}
   \]

   Here, \(EG\) is the median of \(\triangle DEF\). We know \(BC = 30\) and \(EF = 15\).

   \[
   \frac{15}{EG} = \frac{30}{15}
   \]

   Simplify the right-hand side:

   \[
   \frac{15}{EG} = 2
   \]

   Solve for \(EG\):

   \[
   EG = \frac{15}{2} = 7.5
   \]

5. **Find \(EH\)**:
   Since \(E\) is the midpoint of \(DF\), \(EH\) is half of \(EG\):

   \[
   EH = \frac{EG}{2} = \frac{7.5}{2} = 3.75
   \]

However, we notice that the problem asks for \(EH\) directly. Given the similarity and the fact that \(EG\) is twice the length of \(EH\):

\[EH = \frac{EG}{2} = \frac{15}{2} = 7.5\]

Thus, the correct answer is:
