Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. We have a trapezoid \(ABCD\) with midpoints \(S\) and \(T\) of the legs \(AC\) and \(BD\) respectively.
2. The lengths of the bases \(AB\) and \(CD\) are given as:
   \[
   AB = x + 4
   \]
   \[
   CD = 3x + 2
   \]
3. The length of the segment \(ST\) connecting these midpoints is given as:
   \[
   ST = 9
   \]

We need to find the value of \(AB\). According to the Midsegment Theorem for trapezoids, the length of the segment connecting the midpoints of the non-parallel sides (the midsegment) is equal to half the sum of the lengths of the two parallel sides (the bases).

So, we can write:
\[
ST = \frac{AB + CD}{2}
\]

Substituting the given values:
\[
9 = \frac{(x + 4) + (3x + 2)}{2}
\]

Now, let's solve for \(x\):
\[
9 = \frac{x + 4 + 3x + 2}{2}
\]
\[
9 = \frac{4x + 6}{2}
\]
\[
9 = 2x + 3
\]
\[
9 - 3 = 2x
\]
\[
6 = 2x
\]
\[
x = 3
\]

Now substitute \(x = 3\) back into the expression for \(AB\):
\[
AB = x + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7
\]

Therefore, the length of \(AB\) is \(7\).

The length of \(AB\) is \(7\).
