To find JL, we need to analyze the given triangle JKL. We know the lengths of sides JK and KL, and the base JL is expressed as x + 12. We can use the property of the median in a triangle, which states that the median divides the opposite side into two equal parts.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Median**: Since JKL is a triangle and JL is a base, we can assume that KJ is a median to the base JL. This means that KJ = KL because medians divide the opposite side into two equal parts.

2. **Set Up the Equation**: Given that KJ = 7x and KL = 11x - 8, since they are equal (as medians), we have:
   \[
   7x = 11x - 8
   \]

3. **Solve for x**:
   \[
   7x = 11x - 8
   \]
   \[
   7x - 11x = -8
   \]
   \[
   -4x = -8
   \]
   \[
   x = 2
   \]

4. **Calculate JL**:
   Substitute x = 2 into the expression for JL:
   \[
   JL = x + 12 = 2 + 12 = 14
   \]

Now, let's compare our calculated result with the given answer choices: A. 7, B. 11, C. 12, D. 14.

Our calculated result matches option D.
