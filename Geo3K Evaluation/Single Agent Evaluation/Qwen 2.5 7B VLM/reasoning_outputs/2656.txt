Let's analyze the image step by step:

1. **Identify the shape**: The figure is a parallelogram, which means opposite sides are equal and parallel.
2. **Given Information**:
   - Side AD = 13 yd
   - Side CD = 10 yd (base)
   - Angle ABC = 45°
   - We need to find the area of the parallelogram.

3. **Finding the height**:
   - Since angle ABC is 45°, triangle ABE forms a right triangle where AE is the height and BE is the base of the parallelogram.
   - In a 45°-45°-90° triangle, the legs are equal. Therefore, AE = BE.
   - Let AE = BE = x.
   - Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ABE:
     \[
     AB^2 = AE^2 + BE^2
     \]
     \[
     AB^2 = x^2 + x^2
     \]
     \[
     AB^2 = 2x^2
     \]
     \[
     AB = x\sqrt{2}
     \]

4. **Finding the length of AB**:
   - Since AB is part of the parallelogram and forms a right triangle with the height and the base:
     \[
     AB = AD = 13 \text{ yd}
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     x\sqrt{2} = 13
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{13}{\sqrt{2}}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{13\sqrt{2}}{2}
     \]

5. **Calculating the area**:
   - The area \(A\) of a parallelogram is given by:
     \[
     A = \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]
   - Here, the base is CD = 10 yd and the height is AE:
     \[
     A = 10 \times \frac{13\sqrt{2}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     A = 5 \times 13\sqrt{2}
     \]
     \[
     A = 65\sqrt{2}
     \]

6. **Approximating the area**:
   - Approximate \(\sqrt{2} \approx 1.414\):
     \[
     A \approx 65 \times 1.414
     \]
     \[
     A \approx 91.91
     \]

Based on the calculations, the area of the parallelogram is approximately 91.91 square yards.

<solution>
The area of the parallelogram is approximately 91.91 square yards.
