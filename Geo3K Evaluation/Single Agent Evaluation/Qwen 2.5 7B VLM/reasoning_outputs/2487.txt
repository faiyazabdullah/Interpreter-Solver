Let's analyze the given information and the geometric relationships in the image:

1. We have three circles labeled G, J, and K which all intersect at point L.
2. Point H lies on circle G.
3. We know the distance GH = 10.
4. We need to find the distance FH.

Since there is no direct connection between points F and H through the intersection points or additional information linking F to H directly, we must consider the possible relationships within the circles.

Given that the circles intersect at L, it implies some symmetry or equal distances due to the properties of circles and their intersections. However, without more specific information about the positions or radii of the circles, we cannot determine the exact length of FH directly from the given information alone.

The problem does not provide enough geometric constraints or relationships involving point F and point H to calculate the distance FH accurately. Therefore, the best approach would be to consider the given answer choices and choose the most reasonable guess based on the information available.

Given the choices:
A. 5
B. 10
C. 20
D. 25

If we assume a proportional relationship or a typical geometric configuration where distances might be scaled versions of each other (e.g., similar triangles or symmetrical arrangements), we can infer that the distance FH might be double the distance GH since L is the common intersection point and there isn't any information suggesting otherwise.

Thus, the most plausible answer among the choices is:
