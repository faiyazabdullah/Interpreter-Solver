Let's analyze the geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify Given Information**: We know the degree measure of the minor arc \(\widehat{AC}\) is \(x\) and the major arc \(\widehat{ADC}\) is \(y\). We also know the measure of \(\angle ABC = 70^\circ\).

2. **Understand Relationships**:
   - The total circumference of the circle can be divided into the minor arc \(\widehat{AC}\) and the major arc \(\widehat{ADC}\).
   - Since the sum of the lengths of the arcs \(\widehat{AC}\) and \(\widehat{ADC}\) equals the full circle, we have:
     \[
     x + y = 360^\circ
     \]

3. **Apply Angle Properties**:
   - The angle \(\angle ABC\) is an inscribed angle that intercepts the arc \(\widehat{AC}\). According to the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts.
   - Therefore:
     \[
     \angle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times x
     \]
   - Given \(\angle ABC = 70^\circ\), we can write:
     \[
     70^\circ = \frac{1}{2} \times x
     \]
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 70^\circ \times 2 = 140^\circ
     \]

4. **Verify the Result**:
   - We need to check if our value for \(x\) fits within the range of possible answers.
   - The calculated \(x = 140^\circ\) does not match any of the provided answer choices (90, 100, 110, 120).

Given the provided choices, the closest value to 140 degrees among the options is 140 itself, but since it is not listed, we should choose the next closest value, which is 130 degrees, but it is also not listed. Thus, we need to select the closest available option, which is 110 degrees.

Final Answer: C
