Let's analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the given information**: We have two tangent segments from a point outside the circle to the points \(D\) and \(E\). The lengths of these tangent segments are given as 5 and 4 respectively.

2. **Understand the geometric property**: According to the Tangent-Secant Theorem, the lengths of the two tangent segments drawn from the same external point to a circle are equal. However, here we have two different tangent segments, which suggests they are tangents to the circle from the same external point.

3. **Set up the equation**: Since the segments \(AD\) and \(AE\) are tangents from the same external point \(A\), we can equate their lengths:
   \[
   AD = AE
   \]
   Given \(AD = 5\) and \(AE = x + 8\).

4. **Solve for \(x\)**:
   \[
   5 = x + 8
   \]
   Subtract 8 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 5 - 8
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   x = -3
   \]

However, since \(x\) represents a length, it cannot be negative. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation that the segments are tangents from a common external point.

Given the lengths directly, we see that:
\[
x = 4
\]

Thus, the value of \(x\) is 4.

**Solution**:
The correct value of \(x\) is 4.
