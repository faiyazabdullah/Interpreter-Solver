<think>
Let's analyze the given trapezoid ABCD with midpoints S and T of legs AB and CD respectively. We know the following:

- CD = 14
- ST = 10
- AB = 2x

We need to find the value of x.

First, recall a key property of trapezoids: The segment connecting the midpoints of the legs (ST) is parallel to the bases (AB and CD) and its length is the average of the lengths of the bases. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

\[ ST = \frac{AB + CD}{2} \]

Substitute the known values into the equation:

\[ 10 = \frac{2x + 14}{2} \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

1. Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[ 20 = 2x + 14 \]

2. Subtract 14 from both sides:
   \[ 6 = 2x \]

3. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[ x = 3 \]

So, the value of \( x \) is 3.

<solution>
The value of \( x \) is 3. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
