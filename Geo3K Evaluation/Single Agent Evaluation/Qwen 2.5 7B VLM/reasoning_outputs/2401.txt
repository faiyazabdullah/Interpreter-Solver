Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the shape**: The figure is an isosceles triangle with sides AB = BC = 13 and base AC = 10.

2. **Find the height**: We need to find the height from vertex B to base AC. Let's call the midpoint of AC as point D. Since AD = DC = 5 (half of AC), we can form two right triangles ABD and BCD.

3. **Use Pythagorean theorem**: In triangle ABD, we have:
   \[
   AB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2
   \]
   Plugging in the known values:
   \[
   13^2 = 5^2 + BD^2
   \]
   \[
   169 = 25 + BD^2
   \]
   \[
   BD^2 = 144
   \]
   \[
   BD = 12
   \]

4. **Calculate the area**: The area of triangle ABC can be found using the formula for the area of a triangle:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]
   Here, the base is AC = 10 and the height is BD = 12.
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 12 = 60
   \]

Now, let's compare our result with the given answer choices.

The calculated area is 60. Therefore, the correct answer choice is:
