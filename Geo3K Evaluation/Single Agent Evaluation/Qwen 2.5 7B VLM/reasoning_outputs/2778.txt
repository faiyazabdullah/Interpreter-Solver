First, let's analyze the given geometric figure. We have a circle with a chord XY and a tangent YT at point T. The length of the tangent YT is given as 6 units. We also know that the segment WX has a length of 7 units. The chord XY intersects the circle at points X and Y, and the point W lies on the extension of XY.

We need to find the length of the chord XY (denoted as \(x\)).

According to the Power of a Point theorem, for a point outside a circle, the power of the point with respect to the circle is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments of any secant line through the point. Here, point T is outside the circle, and the tangent YT is perpendicular to the radius AT.

The Power of a Point theorem states:
\[ YT^2 = WX \cdot XY \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 6^2 = 7 \cdot x \]
\[ 36 = 7x \]
\[ x = \frac{36}{7} \]

Now, let's compare our calculated result with the given answer choices:
A. \(\frac{72}{7}\)
B. 14
C. \(\frac{95}{6}\)
D. \(\frac{97}{6}\)

Our calculated result is \(\frac{36}{7}\), which is closest to option A (\(\frac{72}{7}\)).

Final Answer: A
