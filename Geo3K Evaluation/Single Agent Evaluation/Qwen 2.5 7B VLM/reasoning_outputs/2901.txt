<think>
First, let's analyze the given geometric figure. We have two triangles, \(\triangle WXY\) and \(\triangle WXZ\), which are congruent (\(\triangle WXY \cong \triangle WXZ\)). This implies that corresponding sides and angles are equal.

From the diagram:
- The length of segment \(XY\) is given as 19.
- The length of segment \(XZ\) is given as \(3y + 7\).
- The angle at vertex \(W\) is marked as \((20y + 10)^\circ\).

Since \(\triangle WXY \cong \triangle WXZ\), the lengths of the corresponding sides must be equal:
\[ XY = XZ \]
So,
\[ 19 = 3y + 7 \]

Now, let's solve for \(y\):
\[ 19 = 3y + 7 \]
Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[ 19 - 7 = 3y \]
\[ 12 = 3y \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ y = \frac{12}{3} \]
\[ y = 4 \]

Thus, the value of \(y\) is 4.

Solution Section:

The value of \(y\) is 4. Comparing this with the given answer choices, we select the closest option.
