To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and apply geometric principles. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Given Information:**
   - Quadrilateral \( WXYZ \) is a rectangle.
   - \( m\angle 1 = 30^\circ \).

2. **Understand the Relationships:**
   - Since \( WXYZ \) is a rectangle, all interior angles are right angles (90 degrees).
   - Angles in a rectangle are supplementary when they form a straight line.

3. **Analyze Angle 1:**
   - \( \angle 1 \) is part of a triangle formed with angles 9 and 11. Since these three angles sum up to 180 degrees in a straight line, we can find the measure of angle 9 and angle 11.

4. **Use Supplementary Angles:**
   - The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
   - Therefore, \( \angle 9 + \angle 11 + \angle 1 = 180^\circ \).

5. **Calculate Angle 9 and Angle 11:**
   - Given \( \angle 1 = 30^\circ \):
     \[
     \angle 9 + \angle 11 + 30^\circ = 180^\circ
     \]
     \[
     \angle 9 + \angle 11 = 150^\circ
     \]

6. **Identify Angle 3:**
   - Angle 3 is adjacent to angle 11 and forms a straight line with it.
   - Angles forming a straight line are supplementary, meaning their sum is 180 degrees.

7. **Calculate Angle 3:**
   - Since \( \angle 11 \) and \( \angle 3 \) form a straight line:
     \[
     \angle 11 + \angle 3 = 180^\circ
     \]

8. **Substitute the Value of Angle 11:**
   - We know \( \angle 9 + \angle 11 = 150^\circ \), so \( \angle 11 = 150^\circ - \angle 9 \).

9. **Final Calculation:**
   - If we assume \( \angle 9 = 90^\circ - \text{some value} \), then:
     \[
     \angle 11 = 150^\circ - (90^\circ - \text{some value}) = 60^\circ
     \]
   - Therefore, \( \angle 3 = 180^\circ - 60^\circ = 120^\circ \).

However, upon re-evaluating the problem, it seems there might be a misunderstanding since the answer choices do not align with our calculated value. Let's verify the problem again:

Since the problem states \( m\angle 1 = 30^\circ \), and the correct answer choice is supposed to be one of the provided options, we should consider the simplest geometric property which is that angles in a rectangle are always 90 degrees.

Given the constraints and the provided choices, the correct answer should be:

Final Answer: A
