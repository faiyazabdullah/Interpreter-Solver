To solve for the value of \( y \), we need to use the given information about the angles in the figure.

1. **Identify the given angles and their relationships:**
   - Angle \( Y \) is labeled as \( (y + 25)^\circ \).
   - Angle \( D \) is labeled as \( (3x - 15)^\circ \).
   - The angle between line segments \( DA \) and \( EB \) is \( 105^\circ \).

2. **Understand the relationship between these angles:**
   - Since \( DA \) and \( EB \) form a straight line, the sum of the angles on the same side of the line must be \( 180^\circ \).

3. **Set up the equation for the straight line:**
   \[
   (3x - 15)^\circ + (y + 25)^\circ = 180^\circ
   \]

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   3x - 15 + y + 25 = 180
   \]
   \[
   3x + y + 10 = 180
   \]
   \[
   3x + y = 170
   \]

5. **Isolate \( y \):**
   \[
   y = 170 - 3x
   \]

Since the problem does not provide the value of \( x \), we need to consider the possible values for \( y \) that fit within the given choices (A, B, C, D).

6. **Evaluate the possible values:**
   - If \( y = 30^\circ \):
     \[
     3x + 30 = 170 \implies 3x = 140 \implies x = \frac{140}{3} \approx 46.67
     \]
     This value of \( x \) does not seem to fit the context of the problem.

   - If \( y = 50^\circ \):
     \[
     3x + 50 = 170 \implies 3x = 120 \implies x = 40
     \]
     This value of \( x \) seems reasonable.

   - If \( y = 60^\circ \):
     \[
     3x + 60 = 170 \implies 3x = 110 \implies x = \frac{110}{3} \approx 36.67
     \]
     This value of \( x \) also does not seem to fit the context of the problem.

   - If \( y = 80^\circ \):
     \[
     3x + 80 = 170 \implies 3x = 90 \implies x = 30
     \]
     This value of \( x \) seems reasonable but not as strong as \( x = 40 \).

Given the context and the closest reasonable fit, the most plausible value for \( y \) is \( 50^\circ \).
