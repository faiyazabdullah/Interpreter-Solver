Let's analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify Key Elements**: 
   - There is a circle with points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\), and \(E\) marked on it.
   - Segments \(AC\), \(AD\), \(BC\), and \(BD\) are chords of the circle.
   - Segments \(AE\) and \(BE\) are radii of the circle, meeting at point \(E\).
   - Segments \(CE\) and \(DE\) are also radii of the circle, meeting at point \(E\).
   - Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\), and \(E\) form a cyclic quadrilateral.

2. **Understand the Relationships**:
   - Since \(AE\) and \(BE\) are radii of the circle, they are equal in length.
   - Similarly, \(CE\) and \(DE\) are equal in length because they are radii of the same circle.
   - The problem states that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent. However, there are no tangent segments visible in the figure.

3. **Analyze the Angles and Segments**:
   - Since \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) lie on the circumference of the circle, we can use the property that the opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral sum up to 180 degrees.
   - Given the symmetry and the lengths provided, let's consider the triangle formed by the center \(O\) and points \(A\) and \(B\).

4. **Calculate the Lengths**:
   - Since \(A\) and \(B\) are endpoints of the diameter, the distance \(AB\) is twice the radius of the circle.
   - The radius \(OA = OB = OC = OD = OE = 8\).

5. **Use the Inscribed Angle Theorem**:
   - The inscribed angle theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
   - If \(\angle AOB\) is a right angle (90 degrees) because \(AB\) is a diameter, then \(\angle ACB\) and \(\angle ADB\) each subtend arcs \(ACB\) and \(ADB\), respectively.

6. **Determine \(x\)**:
   - Since \(AB\) is the diameter, \(\angle ACB\) and \(\angle ADB\) are both right angles (90 degrees).
   - Therefore, the length of \(AB\) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle \(ACB\) and \(ADB\).
   - Given the symmetry and the fact that \(AB = 16\), the length of \(x\) (which is half of \(AB\)) is 8.

<solution>
Based on the analysis, the length of \(x\) is 8.
