First, let's analyze the given triangles \(\triangle JLM\) and \(\triangle QST\). Both triangles are similar because they share corresponding angles marked with arcs, which means their corresponding sides are proportional.

Given:
- \(JL = 3y - 2\)
- \(LM = 6x - 3\)
- \(SJ = 3\)
- \(QT = 2\)
- \(TQ = 5\)

Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of their corresponding sides must be equal. Therefore, we can set up the following proportion:

\[
\frac{JL}{SJ} = \frac{LM}{TQ}
\]

Substituting the known values into the proportion:

\[
\frac{3y - 2}{3} = \frac{6x - 3}{2}
\]

To solve for \(x\), we first clear the fractions by cross-multiplying:

\[
2(3y - 2) = 3(6x - 3)
\]

Expanding both sides:

\[
6y - 4 = 18x - 9
\]

Rearrange the equation to isolate \(x\):

\[
6y - 4 + 9 = 18x
\]

\[
6y + 5 = 18x
\]

Divide both sides by 18:

\[
x = \frac{6y + 5}{18}
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(y\) using the other given side lengths. Since \(TQ = 5\) and \(QT = 2\), we have:

\[
\frac{JL}{SJ} = \frac{LM}{TQ}
\]

\[
\frac{3y - 2}{3} = \frac{6x - 3}{2}
\]

We already have:

\[
6y + 5 = 18x
\]

Let's test the possible values of \(x\) from the answer choices:

If \(x = 1.5\):

\[
6y + 5 = 18 \times 1.5
\]

\[
6y + 5 = 27
\]

\[
6y = 22
\]

\[
y = \frac{22}{6} = 3.6667
\]

This value does not match the given form \(3y - 2\).

If \(x = 2\):

\[
6y + 5 = 18 \times 2
\]

\[
6y + 5 = 36
\]

\[
6y = 31
\]

\[
y = \frac{31}{6} \approx 5.1667
\]

This value also does not match the given form \(3y - 2\).

If \(x = 3\):

\[
6y + 5 = 18 \times 3
\]

\[
6y + 5 = 54
\]

\[
6y = 49
\]

\[
y = \frac{49}{6} \approx 8.1667
\]

This value does not match the given form \(3y - 2\).

If \(x = 4\):

\[
6y + 5 = 18 \times 4
\]

\[
6y + 5 = 72
\]

\[
6y = 67
\]

\[
y = \frac{67}{6} \approx 11.1667
\]

This value does not match the given form \(3y - 2\).

Since none of these exact values fit the form \(3y - 2\), we need to re-evaluate our approach. However, the closest value that fits the proportional relationship is \(x = 2\).
