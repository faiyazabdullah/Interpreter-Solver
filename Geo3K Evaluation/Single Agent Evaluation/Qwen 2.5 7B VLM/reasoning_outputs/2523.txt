To solve for \( x \) in the given geometric figure, let's follow these steps:

### Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Figure
The figure consists of two rectangles \(ABCD\) and \(EFGH\). Rectangle \(ABCD\) is inside rectangle \(EFGH\) and appears to be a smaller rectangle that fits perfectly within the larger one.

### Step 2: Identify Given Information
- The dimensions of rectangle \(EFGH\):
  - Length \(EF = 7.5\)
  - Width \(EH = 5\)

- The dimensions of rectangle \(ABCD\):
  - Length \(AD = x\)
  - Width \(AB = x - 2\)

### Step 3: Understand Similarity
Since the rectangles are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional. Therefore, we can set up a proportion between the lengths and widths of the rectangles.

### Step 4: Set Up Proportion
The ratio of the lengths of the rectangles is the same as the ratio of their widths:
\[
\frac{AD}{EF} = \frac{AB}{EH}
\]

Substituting the known values:
\[
\frac{x}{7.5} = \frac{x - 2}{5}
\]

### Step 5: Solve the Equation
Cross-multiply to solve for \(x\):
\[
5x = 7.5(x - 2)
\]
\[
5x = 7.5x - 15
\]

Rearrange the equation to isolate \(x\):
\[
5x - 7.5x = -15
\]
\[
-2.5x = -15
\]

Divide both sides by \(-2.5\):
\[
x = \frac{-15}{-2.5} = 6
\]

### Step 6: Verify the Solution
The calculated value of \(x\) is 6. We should check if it matches any of the given answer choices.

### Step 7: Select the Correct Answer
The closest answer choice to \(x = 6\) is:
Final Answer: D
