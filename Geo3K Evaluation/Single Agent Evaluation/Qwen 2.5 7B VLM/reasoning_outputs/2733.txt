First, let's analyze the given geometric figure:

1. The figure consists of a square ABCD.
2. The side length of the square is given as 12 units.
3. There is a diagonal AC drawn inside the square.
4. The diagonal AC divides the square into two congruent right triangles.
5. We need to find the length of the diagonal AC, which is labeled as 'y'.

Since the diagonal of a square divides it into two congruent right triangles, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal. The diagonal of a square forms a right triangle with two sides of the square as its legs.

Let's apply the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ y^2 = 12^2 + 12^2 \]
\[ y^2 = 144 + 144 \]
\[ y^2 = 288 \]
\[ y = \sqrt{288} \]
\[ y = \sqrt{144 \times 2} \]
\[ y = 12\sqrt{2} \]

Now, let's compare our calculated result with the given answer choices:
A. \( 6\sqrt{2} \)
B. \( 12\sqrt{2} \)
C. \( 12\sqrt{3} \)
D. \( 24 \)

The calculated value of \( y \) is \( 12\sqrt{2} \), which matches option B.
