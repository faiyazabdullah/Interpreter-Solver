Let's start by understanding the geometric relationships and constraints given in the problem:

1. **Identify the Perpendicular Bisectors**: Lines \(l\), \(m\), and \(n\) are the perpendicular bisectors of \(\triangle PQR\). This means they each cut their respective sides of the triangle perpendicularly at midpoints and intersect at the circumcenter \(T\).

2. **Given Measurements**:
   - \(TQ = 2x\)
   - \(PT = 3y - 1\)
   - \(TR = 8\)

3. **Objective**: Find the value of \(z\), which appears to be related to the length \(PR\).

Given that \(PQ\), \(QR\), and \(PR\) are segments of the triangle and \(T\) is the circumcenter, we can use the fact that the circumradius \(R\) (distance from the circumcenter to any vertex) is constant for a triangle. Since \(TR = 8\), it suggests that the circumradius \(R = 8\).

4. **Using the Properties of the Perpendicular Bisectors**:
   - Since \(T\) is the circumcenter, the distances \(TP\), \(TQ\), and \(TR\) are radii of the circumcircle. Therefore, \(TP = TR = 8\).
   - Given \(PT = 3y - 1\), we equate it to the known radius \(8\):
     \[
     3y - 1 = 8
     \]
     Solving for \(y\):
     \[
     3y = 9 \implies y = 3
     \]

5. **Finding \(z\)**:
   - We need to find \(z + 4\). From the diagram, \(z\) corresponds to the length of \(PR\) minus the known segment lengths involving \(T\).
   - Since \(TR = 8\) and considering the entire length \(PR\), we can infer that \(z + 4\) is part of the total length \(PR\).

Given the options:
- If \(z + 4 = 5\), then \(z = 1\), which doesn't fit the pattern.
- If \(z + 4 = 6\), then \(z = 2\), which also doesn't fit.
- If \(z + 4 = 7\), then \(z = 3\), which fits the pattern and aligns with the derived value of \(y\).

Thus, the closest fitting value for \(z\) is 3.

<solution>
Based on the analysis, the correct value for \(z\) is 3.
