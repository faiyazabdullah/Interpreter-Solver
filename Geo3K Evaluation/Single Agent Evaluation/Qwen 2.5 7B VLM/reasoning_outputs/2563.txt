Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - We have a parallelogram \(JKLM\).
   - One angle in the parallelogram is given as \(70^\circ\).
   - Another angle is given as \(30^\circ\).
   - We need to find the measure of \(\angle KJL\).

2. **Understand the properties of a parallelogram:**
   - Opposite angles in a parallelogram are equal.
   - Adjacent angles in a parallelogram are supplementary (add up to \(180^\circ\)).

3. **Determine the angles:**
   - Since \(JKLM\) is a parallelogram, \(\angle JKL = 70^\circ\) and \(\angle KLM = 70^\circ\).
   - The adjacent angle \(\angle JMK = 180^\circ - 70^\circ = 110^\circ\).

4. **Find \(\angle KJL\):**
   - \(\angle KJL\) is adjacent to \(\angle JKM\), which means they add up to \(180^\circ\).
   - Therefore, \(\angle KJL = 180^\circ - 110^\circ = 70^\circ\).

However, we notice that there is another angle given as \(30^\circ\). This might be part of another triangle within the parallelogram, but it does not directly affect the calculation of \(\angle KJL\).

Given the choices:
- A. \(30^\circ\)
- B. \(40^\circ\)
- C. \(50^\circ\)
- D. \(60^\circ\)

Since our calculation shows \(\angle KJL = 70^\circ\), and none of the choices match, we must choose the closest value among the given options.

The closest value to \(70^\circ\) among the choices is \(60^\circ\).
