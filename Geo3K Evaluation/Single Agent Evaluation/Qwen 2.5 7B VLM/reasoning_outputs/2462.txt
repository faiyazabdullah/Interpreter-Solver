To solve this problem, we need to find the radius of the circle given the lengths of the sides of the triangle formed within the circle.

1. **Identify Given Information:**
   - AB is a diameter of the circle.
   - AC = 8 inches.
   - BC = 15 inches.
   
2. **Understand the Geometric Relationships:**
   - Since AB is a diameter, angle ACB is a right angle (90 degrees) because it subtends a semicircle.
   - This means triangle ABC is a right triangle with the right angle at C.

3. **Apply Pythagorean Theorem:**
   - Let's denote the radius of the circle as \( r \).
   - AB being the diameter, its length is \( 2r \).

4. **Calculate the Length of AB:**
   - Using the Pythagorean theorem for triangle ABC:
     \[
     AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2
     \]
     \[
     (2r)^2 = 8^2 + 15^2
     \]
     \[
     4r^2 = 64 + 225
     \]
     \[
     4r^2 = 289
     \]
     \[
     r^2 = \frac{289}{4}
     \]
     \[
     r = \sqrt{\frac{289}{4}}
     \]
     \[
     r = \frac{\sqrt{289}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     r = \frac{17}{2}
     \]
     \[
     r = 8.5
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The radius of the circle is 8.5 inches.
