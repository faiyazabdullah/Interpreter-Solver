<think>
Let's analyze the given geometric figure:

1. The figure is a parallelogram with vertices labeled A, B, C, and D.
2. The base of the parallelogram is given as 28 feet.
3. There is a height drawn from vertex C perpendicular to side AB, which is 9 feet.
4. An angle at vertex B is given as 45Â°.

To find the area of the parallelogram, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

Here, the base \( b \) is 28 feet and the height \( h \) is 9 feet. Plugging these values into the formula gives:
\[ \text{Area} = 28 \times 9 = 252 \text{ square feet} \]

Now, let's compare this result with the given answer choices:
A. 89.1
B. 178.2
C. 252.0
D. 356.4

The calculated area of 252 square feet matches exactly with option C.

Final Answer: C</think>

Upon reviewing the calculations and the provided choices, the correct answer is indeed C. Therefore, the final answer is:
