To solve this problem, let's analyze the given information and the geometric relationships in the figure:

1. We are given the lengths GJ = 8, GH = 12, and HI = 4.
2. We need to find the length KJ.
3. Observing the figure, it appears that GJ, GH, and HI form a straight line, and KJ is a segment perpendicular to HI at point K.
4. Since GJ, GH, and HI form a straight line, the total length from G to I is the sum of GJ + GH + HI.
5. Therefore, GI = GJ + GH + HI = 8 + 12 + 4 = 24.
6. KJ is a vertical segment perpendicular to HI, so we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle GKI to find KJ.
7. In triangle GKI, GK is the hypotenuse, and GK² = GJ² + GK².
8. However, since KJ is perpendicular to HI, we can directly use the given lengths to find KJ without needing to calculate GK.

Since KJ is the height of the right triangle formed by GJ, GH, and HI, and considering the lengths given, we can infer that KJ is the difference between the segments involving GJ and HI, which is 4.

Now, let's verify the calculation:
- The total length GI is 24.
- Since KJ is perpendicular to HI and forms a right angle with it, and considering the given lengths, KJ is simply the difference between GJ and HI, which is 4.

Thus, the length KJ is 4.

KJ = 4
