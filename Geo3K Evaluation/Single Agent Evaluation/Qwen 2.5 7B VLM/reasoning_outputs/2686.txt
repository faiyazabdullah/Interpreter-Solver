Let's analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify Given Information:**
   - There is a straight line \(DB\).
   - Point \(C\) lies on \(DB\).
   - Point \(A\) is connected to points \(B\) and \(C\).
   - An angle \(ACD\) is marked as \(92^\circ\).

2. **Understand Relationships:**
   - Since \(ACD\) is a straight line segment, the angle \(ACD\) forms a linear pair with another angle \(ACB\). Linear pairs are supplementary, meaning they add up to \(180^\circ\).
   - Therefore, \(m\angle ACB = 180^\circ - 92^\circ = 88^\circ\).

3. **Identify Triangle \(ABC\):**
   - We have a triangle \(ABC\) with known angle at \(C\).
   - To find \(m\angle ABC\), we need more information about the triangle. However, since no additional angles are given, we assume itâ€™s a simple triangle without specific angle sum rules applied (like right angles or isosceles properties).

4. **Assess Angle Relationships:**
   - The problem does not specify any specific relationship between the angles in triangle \(ABC\) beyond the straight line property.
   - Thus, the remaining angle \(m\angle ABC\) can be derived directly from the supplementary nature of the linear pair.

Given the supplementary property of the angles around point \(C\):

- \(m\angle ABC = 180^\circ - 88^\circ = 92^\circ\).

However, considering the standard geometric properties and the supplementary nature of linear pairs, the angle \(m\angle ABC\) should logically be \(88^\circ\).

Since none of the given choices match \(88^\circ\), we must select the closest value which is not explicitly derived but can be inferred as the closest possible answer.
