Let's start by analyzing the given information and the geometric relationships in the figure:

1. We know that \( PR \parallel KL \).
2. The lengths \( KN = 9 \) and \( LN = 16 \).
3. We need to find \( KM \).

Since \( PR \parallel KL \), we can use the properties of similar triangles or the Midsegment theorem to solve for \( KM \). However, in this case, we will use the fact that \( PM = 2KP \).

First, let's denote \( KP = x \). Then \( PM = 2x \).

Since \( KN = 9 \) and \( LN = 16 \), we have \( KL = KN + NL = 9 + 16 = 25 \).

Because \( PR \parallel KL \), triangle \( QPM \) is similar to triangle \( QKL \). Therefore, the ratio of corresponding sides is the same. Specifically, the ratio of the segments on the parallel line \( PR \) is the same as the ratio of the segments on \( KL \).

Thus, we can set up the proportion:
\[ \frac{KP}{KL} = \frac{PM}{KL} \]
\[ \frac{x}{25} = \frac{2x}{25} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ x = 10 \]

Therefore, \( KP = 10 \) and \( PM = 20 \).

Now, since \( QM \) is the height of the trapezoid and it splits the trapezoid into two smaller triangles, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find \( KM \).

In triangle \( QKM \):
\[ QM^2 = KM^2 - KP^2 \]
\[ QM^2 = KM^2 - 10^2 \]
\[ QM^2 = KM^2 - 100 \]

Since \( QM \) is the height of the trapezoid and we know that \( QM = 12 \) (from the properties of the trapezoid and the given lengths), we can substitute:
\[ 12^2 = KM^2 - 100 \]
\[ 144 = KM^2 - 100 \]
\[ KM^2 = 244 \]
\[ KM = \sqrt{244} \approx 15.62 \]

However, the closest option among the provided choices is \( 15 \).
