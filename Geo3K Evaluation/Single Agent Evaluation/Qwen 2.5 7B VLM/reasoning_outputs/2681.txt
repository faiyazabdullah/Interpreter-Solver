First, let's analyze the given geometric figure:

1. We have a quadrilateral labeled ABCD.
2. Points B, A, and D form right angles with AB, AD, and BD respectively.
3. AB = x, AD = 4, BD = 6, BC = z.
4. We need to find the length y, which represents the diagonal AC.

Given these points, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ABD and triangle ABC.

Step 1: Apply the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ABD.
\[ AB^2 + AD^2 = BD^2 \]
\[ x^2 + 4^2 = 6^2 \]
\[ x^2 + 16 = 36 \]
\[ x^2 = 20 \]
\[ x = 2\sqrt{5} \]

Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ABC.
\[ AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2 \]
Since BC = z, we know:
\[ (2\sqrt{5})^2 + z^2 = y^2 \]
\[ 20 + z^2 = y^2 \]

Step 3: Since point C lies on BD extended, BD = 6, and BD forms a right angle with AB and AD, it implies that z = 6. Therefore,
\[ 20 + 6^2 = y^2 \]
\[ 20 + 36 = y^2 \]
\[ 56 = y^2 \]
\[ y = \sqrt{56} \]
\[ y = 2\sqrt{14} \]

Upon re-evaluating, we realize there seems to be a discrepancy because y should be a simpler value. Let's recheck the problem statement and figure out the correct approach:

It appears y should be directly related to the given dimensions without involving square roots of higher values. Given the choices, let's simplify:
Since y is a diagonal and considering the simplest geometric configuration, we should look at the given choices for the closest match. The closest value among the choices is:
