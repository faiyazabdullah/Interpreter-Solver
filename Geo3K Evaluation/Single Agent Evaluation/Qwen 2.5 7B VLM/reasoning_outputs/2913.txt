To solve for \( x \) in the given geometric figure, let's analyze the information step by step:

1. **Identify Given Information:**
   - Triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \).
   - \( AB = 14 \)
   - \( BC = 10 \)

2. **Calculate the hypotenuse \( AC \):**
   Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle ABC \):
   \[
   AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2
   \]
   \[
   AC^2 = 14^2 + 10^2
   \]
   \[
   AC^2 = 196 + 100
   \]
   \[
   AC^2 = 296
   \]
   \[
   AC = \sqrt{296} = 2\sqrt{74}
   \]

3. **Analyze the Relationship with Point \( D \):**
   Since \( D \) forms a quadrilateral with points \( A, B, \) and \( C \), we need to consider the possible configurations. Given the lengths provided, it suggests that \( D \) could be positioned such that \( AD = 14 \) and \( BD = 10 \).

4. **Determine the Length \( x \):**
   If \( D \) is positioned such that \( AD = 14 \) and \( BD = 10 \), then \( x \) would be the length \( DC \). Given the right angle at \( C \), \( DC \) can be determined using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle BCD \).

   However, the direct application of the Pythagorean theorem here isn't straightforward because \( D \) is not necessarily aligned along a straight line extending from \( C \) perpendicularly. Instead, we need to consider the geometric configuration more closely.

5. **Re-evaluate the Configuration:**
   Given the right angle at \( C \) and the lengths provided, the most likely interpretation is that \( D \) forms another right triangle with \( AC \) as the hypotenuse. Therefore, we should re-examine the configuration as a combination of right triangles.

   Given the lengths:
   - \( AD = 14 \)
   - \( BD = 10 \)
   - \( AC = 2\sqrt{74} \)

   We can infer that \( D \) is positioned such that the total length \( x \) aligns with the geometric constraints.

6. **Final Calculation:**
   Given the right angle and the lengths, the most plausible calculation for \( x \) aligns with the Pythagorean relationship directly:
   \[
   x = \sqrt{AD^2 - AC^2}
   \]
   \[
   x = \sqrt{14^2 - (2\sqrt{74})^2}
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   x = \sqrt{196 - 296}
   \]
   \[
   x = \sqrt{100}
   \]
   \[
   x = 10
   \]

Given the choices provided, the closest match is:
