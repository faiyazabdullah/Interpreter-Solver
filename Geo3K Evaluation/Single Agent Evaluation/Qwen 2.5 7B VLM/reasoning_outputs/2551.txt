Let's analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the given lengths:**
   - XN = 6
   - NM = 4
   - NZ = 9

2. **Summarize the known lengths:**
   - The total length of XZ can be found by adding XN and NZ:
     \[
     XZ = XN + NZ = 6 + 9 = 15
     \]

3. **Identify the shape and relationships:**
   - The figure appears to be a triangle XYZ with segment MN inside it.
   - Segment MN is given as 4 units long.

4. **Determine the position of point M:**
   - Point M is located within the triangle XYZ such that XM = 4.
   - Point N divides XZ into two segments: XN = 6 and NZ = 9.

5. **Calculate XY:**
   - Since the figure is not explicitly stated to be a specific type of triangle (like a right triangle or equilateral triangle), we assume the simplest case where the lengths are directly added.
   - XY is the hypotenuse of a right triangle formed by the segments XM and MN when considered perpendicularly. However, without additional information about the angles or the type of triangle, we can only use the direct addition of lengths for simplicity.

Given the lengths:
- XN = 6
- NZ = 9
- XM = 4

The total length of XZ is 15. If XY forms a right angle with XN and NZ, then XY would be the sum of these segments directly.

Since there is no indication of a right angle or any other specific relationship, we assume the simplest linear addition:
\[
XY = XN + NZ = 6 + 9 = 15
\]

However, considering the given choices, the closest value to our calculated length of 15 is not listed among the choices.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The closest value to our calculated length of 15 is 10, which is the largest value in the given choices.

Therefore, based on the closest match to our calculated length, the correct answer is:
