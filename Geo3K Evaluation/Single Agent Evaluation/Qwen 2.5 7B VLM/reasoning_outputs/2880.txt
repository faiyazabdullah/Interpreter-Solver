Let's analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the given information**:
   - \( m \angle MPL = 65^\circ \)
   - \( NP \perp PL \)

2. **Understand the relationships**:
   - Since \( NP \perp PL \), \( \angle NPL = 90^\circ \).
   - This implies that \( \triangle NPL \) is a right triangle with \( \angle NPL = 90^\circ \).

3. **Determine the measure of arc \( NJK \)**:
   - The angle subtended by an arc at the center of the circle is twice the angle subtended at any point on the circumference.
   - Therefore, \( m \widehat{NJK} = 2 \times m \angle MPL = 2 \times 65^\circ = 130^\circ \).

However, we need to find the measure of arc \( NJK \) which is the remaining part of the semicircle not covered by \( \angle MPL \).

4. **Calculate the measure of arc \( NJK \)**:
   - The total measure of the semicircle is \( 180^\circ \).
   - Subtract the measure of \( \angle MPL \) from \( 180^\circ \): \( 180^\circ - 65^\circ = 115^\circ \).

Since the question asks for \( m \widehat{NJK} \), the correct measure is \( 115^\circ \).

Given the answer choices, none of them match \( 115^\circ \). However, the closest option to \( 115^\circ \) is \( 110^\circ \).

Since the closest option is not available, we should choose the next best option which is closest to our calculated value.
