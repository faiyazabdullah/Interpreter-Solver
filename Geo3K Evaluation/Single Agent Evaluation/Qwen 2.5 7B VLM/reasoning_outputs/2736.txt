<think>
First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric figure:

1. The segment WX is tangent to the circle at point X.
2. The length of WX is given as \(2x + 9\).
3. The length of XY is given as \(3x + 6\).

Since WX is tangent to the circle at X, the radius ZX is perpendicular to the tangent WX. Therefore, triangle ZXW forms a right triangle with ZX as the hypotenuse.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can set up the equation:
\[ZX^2 = WX^2 + XY^2\]

We know the lengths of WX and XY:
\[WX = 2x + 9\]
\[XY = 3x + 6\]

Let's denote the radius of the circle as \(r\). Since ZY is the diameter of the circle, it is equal to \(2r\), but for our purposes, we only need the lengths WX and XY.

Now, let's substitute the given lengths into the Pythagorean theorem:
\[r^2 = (2x + 9)^2 + (3x + 6)^2\]

Expanding the squares:
\[r^2 = (2x + 9)^2 + (3x + 6)^2\]
\[r^2 = (4x^2 + 36x + 81) + (9x^2 + 36x + 36)\]
\[r^2 = 4x^2 + 36x + 81 + 9x^2 + 36x + 36\]
\[r^2 = 13x^2 + 72x + 117\]

However, since we are only solving for x, we do not need the radius directly. We can equate the lengths WX and XY to find x:
\[2x + 9 = 3x + 6\]

Solving for x:
\[2x + 9 = 3x + 6\]
\[9 - 6 = 3x - 2x\]
\[3 = x\]

So, the value of x is 3.

Solution:
The value of x is 3.
