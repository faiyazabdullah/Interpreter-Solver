To find KL, we need to determine the length of the side opposite angle JKL. Given the triangle KJL, we have two sides with known expressions: one side is \(x + 7\) and the other is \(4x - 8\). Since the problem does not specify any particular type of triangle (e.g., equilateral, isosceles, right), we assume it is a general triangle. However, the equality of these two sides suggests a specific relationship that could help us find the value of \(x\).

Let's start by setting up the equation based on the given side lengths:
\[ x + 7 = 4x - 8 \]

Now, solve for \(x\):
\[ x + 7 = 4x - 8 \]
\[ 7 + 8 = 4x - x \]
\[ 15 = 3x \]
\[ x = 5 \]

With \(x = 5\), we can substitute back to find the lengths of the sides:
\[ x + 7 = 5 + 7 = 12 \]
\[ 4x - 8 = 4(5) - 8 = 20 - 8 = 12 \]

So, both sides of the triangle are equal to 12. This means the triangle is isosceles with KL being one of the equal sides.

Since the problem asks for the length of KL, and we have determined that KL is 12, the answer is:
