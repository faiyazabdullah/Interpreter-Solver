To find the measure of angle 9, we need to analyze the geometric relationships and angles given in the figure.

1. **Identify Given Angles**: We know the measures of angles 1, 2, and 3.
   - \( m\angle 1 = 58^\circ \)
   - \( m\angle 2 = 47^\circ \)
   - \( m\angle 3 = 26^\circ \)

2. **Understand the Relationships**: The figure appears to involve triangles and straight lines. Let's focus on the triangle \( \triangle ABC \) formed by the intersection of line segments.

3. **Sum of Angles in a Triangle**: The sum of the interior angles in any triangle is always \( 180^\circ \).

4. **Calculate \( m\angle 9 \)**:
   - Angle 9 is part of the larger triangle involving points \( A, B, \) and \( E \).
   - Since \( m\angle 1 + m\angle 2 + m\angle 3 = 58^\circ + 47^\circ + 26^\circ = 131^\circ \), we can find the remaining angle at point \( E \).

5. **Remaining Angle Calculation**:
   - The sum of angles around point \( E \) is \( 360^\circ \).
   - Therefore, the remaining angle at point \( E \) (which includes angle 9) is:
     \[
     360^\circ - 131^\circ = 229^\circ
     \]

6. **Refining the Angle Measure**:
   - Angle 9 is part of the smaller triangle \( \triangle ECD \).
   - Sum of angles in \( \triangle ECD \):
     \[
     m\angle 4 + m\angle 5 + m\angle 9 = 180^\circ
     \]
   - From the given information, we have:
     \[
     m\angle 4 = 47^\circ, \quad m\angle 5 = 26^\circ
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     m\angle 9 = 180^\circ - 47^\circ - 26^\circ = 107^\circ
     \]

7. **Verification**:
   - The calculation seems consistent with the given angles and triangle properties.

Given the closest answer among the choices, the calculated value \( 107^\circ \) does not match any of the provided options directly. However, considering the closest option, we can select:
