To solve this problem, let's analyze the geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the Shape**: We have a rhombus (PQRS) inscribed in a circle. This means all vertices of the rhombus lie on the circumference of the circle.

2. **Properties of a Rhombus Inscribed in a Circle**: When a rhombus is inscribed in a circle, it becomes a square. This is because the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, and for a rhombus to be inscribed in a circle, these diagonals must be equal in length. Therefore, PQRS forms a square.

3. **Central Angle Calculation**: Since PQRS is a square, its four sides are equal, and each interior angle is 90 degrees. The central angles corresponding to the sides of the square are 90 degrees each.

4. **Angle at Vertex S**: We need to find \( m\widehat{SP} \). Since SP is a side of the square, the central angle corresponding to SP is 90 degrees.

Given the above analysis, the measure of the arc \( \widehat{SP} \) is directly related to the central angle at the center of the circle subtended by the side SP. Since SP is one of the four equal sides of the square, the central angle is 90 degrees.

Thus, \( m\widehat{SP} = 90 \).

**Solution Section**

Based on the analysis, the measure of the arc \( \widehat{SP} \) is 90 degrees.
