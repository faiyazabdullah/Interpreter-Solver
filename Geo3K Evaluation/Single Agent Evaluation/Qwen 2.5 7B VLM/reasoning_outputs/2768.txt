To solve for the measure of ∠4, let's analyze the geometric relationships and constraints in the image:

1. **Identify Given Information**: 
   - m∠1 = 50°
   - m∠3 = 60°
   
2. **Understand the Relationships**:
   - The figure appears to involve triangles and possibly parallel lines with transversals.
   - ∠1 and ∠3 seem to be part of a triangle or related to a straight line through vertex points.

3. **Analyze the Triangle**:
   - Consider the triangle formed by vertices B, F, and G (assuming ∠BFG is the triangle).
   - The sum of angles in a triangle is 180°.

4. **Calculate ∠4**:
   - If we consider the triangle at the bottom left, the sum of angles around point G should be checked.
   - ∠4 is part of the larger triangle involving vertices G, H, and I.
   - Using the given angles and properties of triangles, we can infer that ∠4 is supplementary to ∠1 and ∠3 within the context of the triangle.

Given these steps, ∠4 appears to be supplementary to the sum of ∠1 and ∠3 minus their internal angle contributions within the triangle.

Since the problem does not specify a direct linear relationship between ∠4 and the given angles without further assumptions about specific angles within the triangle, we need to use the supplementary property directly.

Let's assume ∠4 is supplementary to the sum of ∠1 and ∠3:
\[ \text{m∠4} = 180° - (\text{m∠1} + \text{m∠3}) \]
\[ \text{m∠4} = 180° - (50° + 60°) \]
\[ \text{m∠4} = 180° - 110° \]
\[ \text{m∠4} = 70° \]

Thus, ∠4 measures 70°.

Solution:
Based on the analysis, the measure of ∠4 is 70°.
