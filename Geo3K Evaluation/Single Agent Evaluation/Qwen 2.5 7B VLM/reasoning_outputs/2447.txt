To find the value of the variable \( y \) in the given geometric figure, we need to use the properties of the quadrilateral and the given angle measures.

1. **Identify the type of quadrilateral**: The figure appears to be a cyclic quadrilateral because it is inscribed in a circle. In a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of opposite angles is always 180 degrees.

2. **Sum of opposite angles**: The angles at vertices \( A \) and \( C \) are \( (3y + 40)^\circ \) and \( (3x - 70)^\circ \) respectively. Since they are opposite angles in the cyclic quadrilateral, their sum should be 180 degrees.
   \[
   (3y + 40) + (3x - 70) = 180
   \]

3. **Simplify the equation**:
   \[
   3y + 40 + 3x - 70 = 180
   \]
   \[
   3y + 3x - 30 = 180
   \]
   \[
   3y + 3x = 210
   \]
   \[
   y + x = 70
   \]

4. **Sum of the remaining angles**: The angles at vertices \( B \) and \( D \) are given as \( x^\circ \) and 120 degrees respectively. Since these are also opposite angles in the cyclic quadrilateral, their sum should be 180 degrees.
   \[
   x + 120 = 180
   \]
   \[
   x = 60
   \]

5. **Substitute \( x = 60 \) into the equation \( y + x = 70 \)**:
   \[
   y + 60 = 70
   \]
   \[
   y = 10
   \]

Thus, the value of the variable \( y \) is 10.
