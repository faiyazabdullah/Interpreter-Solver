To solve this problem, we need to analyze the geometric figure and use the given information to find the measure of ∠7.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - m∠12 = 64°

2. **Understand the geometric relationships:**
   - The figure appears to be a combination of triangles and lines. We need to look for any parallel lines or angles that can help us determine the measure of ∠7.

3. **Analyze the angles:**
   - ∠12 and ∠7 appear to be part of a straight line with another angle (possibly ∠11) forming a linear pair. Linear pairs always add up to 180°.

4. **Calculate the measure of ∠7:**
   - Since ∠12 and ∠7 form a linear pair, their sum is 180°.
   - Therefore, ∠7 = 180° - 64° = 116°.

However, the closest option among A, B, C, and D that matches 116° is not listed. Given the options, the closest match is:
