To solve for \( JK \), let's analyze the given information and the geometric relationships in the diagram:

1. Circle \( J \) has a radius of 10 units.
2. Circle \( K \) has a radius of 8 units.
3. The distance between points \( B \) and \( C \) (denoted as \( BC \)) is 5.4 units.
4. Points \( B \) and \( C \) are points of intersection between the two circles.

We need to find the length of \( JK \).

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. Since \( B \) and \( C \) are points of intersection, the line segment \( BC \) is a chord common to both circles.
2. The line segment \( JK \) connects the centers of the two circles.
3. We can use the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the radii and the chord. Specifically, we can form a right triangle with \( JK \) as the hypotenuse, \( JB \) as one leg (radius of circle \( J \)), and \( KC \) as the other leg (radius of circle \( K \)).

Given:
- Radius of circle \( J \): \( R_J = 10 \)
- Radius of circle \( K \): \( R_K = 8 \)
- Distance between the points of intersection \( BC \): \( BC = 5.4 \)

Using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ JK^2 = R_J^2 + R_K^2 - 2 \cdot R_J \cdot R_K \cdot \cos(\theta) \]

However, since \( BC \) is the chord, we can also consider the perpendicular distance from the center \( J \) to the chord \( BC \). Let's denote this distance as \( h \). Then:
\[ h = \sqrt{R_J^2 - \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{10^2 - \left(\frac{5.4}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{100 - 2.7^2} = \sqrt{100 - 7.29} = \sqrt{92.71} \approx 9.63 \]

Now, the length \( JK \) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem again:
\[ JK = \sqrt{h^2 + \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{9.63^2 + 2.7^2} = \sqrt{92.71 + 7.29} = \sqrt{100} = 10 \]

But this is incorrect because we need to account for the full distance between the centers. Instead, we should directly use:
\[ JK = \sqrt{(R_J + R_K)^2 - BC^2/4} = \sqrt{(10 + 8)^2 - 5.4^2} = \sqrt{18^2 - 5.4^2} = \sqrt{324 - 29.16} = \sqrt{294.84} \approx 17.16 \]

Thus, the correct calculation should be:
\[ JK = \sqrt{18^2 - 5.4^2} = \sqrt{324 - 29.16} = \sqrt{294.84} \approx 17.16 \]

Since the closest option is:
