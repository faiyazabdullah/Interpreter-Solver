Let's analyze the given information and the geometric relationships in the image:

1. **Given Information**: 
   - \( m \angle BAC = 38^\circ \)
   - \( BC = 5 \)
   - \( DC = 5 \)

2. **Identify Key Relationships**:
   - The lengths \( BC \) and \( DC \) being equal suggest that \( \triangle BCD \) might be isosceles with \( BC = DC \).
   - Since \( BC = DC = 5 \), \( \triangle BCD \) could potentially have \( \angle BCD \) being the vertex angle of the isosceles triangle.
   - However, the exact measure of \( \angle BCD \) is not directly given, but we need to find \( m \angle DAC \).

3. **Angle Relationships**:
   - The angle \( \angle BAC \) is given as \( 38^\circ \).
   - Since \( \angle BAC \) and \( \angle DAC \) are adjacent angles forming a straight line at point \( A \), they sum up to \( 180^\circ \).
   - Therefore, \( m \angle DAC = 180^\circ - 38^\circ = 142^\circ \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The calculated value of \( m \angle DAC \) is \( 142^\circ \), which does not match any of the given answer choices (A, B, C, or D).

Since the calculated answer does not match any of the provided choices, we need to select the closest option. The closest option to \( 142^\circ \) among the given choices is \( 140^\circ \), which corresponds to option B.

Final Answer: B
