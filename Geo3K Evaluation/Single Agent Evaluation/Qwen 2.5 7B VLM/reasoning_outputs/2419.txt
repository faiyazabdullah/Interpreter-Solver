To find the circumference of the circle, we need to determine its radius first. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the given information**: The image shows a rectangle inscribed in a circle. The lengths of the sides of the rectangle are given as 6 inches and 8 inches.

2. **Understand the relationship**: Since the rectangle is inscribed in the circle, the diagonal of the rectangle is the diameter of the circle. The diagonal can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.

   Let's denote the length of the diagonal (which is also the diameter) as \(d\).

   \[
   d = \sqrt{6^2 + 8^2} = \sqrt{36 + 64} = \sqrt{100} = 10 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Find the radius**: The radius \(r\) of the circle is half of the diameter.

   \[
   r = \frac{d}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Calculate the circumference**: The formula for the circumference \(C\) of a circle is \(C = 2\pi r\).

   \[
   C = 2\pi \times 5 = 10\pi \text{ inches}
   \]

5. **Compare with the answer choices**: The calculated circumference is \(10\pi\). Comparing this with the given choices, we see that it matches option B.
