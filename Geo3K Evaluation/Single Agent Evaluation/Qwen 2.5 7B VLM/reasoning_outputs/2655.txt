To find the value of \( y \), let's analyze the given geometric figure:

1. **Identify the shape**: The figure appears to be a square since all sides are equal and all angles are right angles (90 degrees).

2. **Given information**:
   - One side length is marked as \( x \).
   - The diagonal of the square is given as 13 units.
   - We need to find the angle \( y \) which is the angle between the diagonal and one of the sides of the square.

3. **Properties of a square**:
   - In a square, the diagonals are equal in length and bisect each other at right angles.
   - The diagonal splits the square into two congruent right triangles.
   - The angle between the diagonal and a side of the square is half of 90 degrees because the diagonal bisects the right angle.

4. **Calculate the side length \( x \)**:
   - Using the Pythagorean theorem for one of the right triangles formed by the diagonal:
     \[
     x^2 + x^2 = 13^2
     \]
     \[
     2x^2 = 169
     \]
     \[
     x^2 = 84.5
     \]
     \[
     x = \sqrt{84.5} \approx 9.19
     \]

5. **Find the angle \( y \)**:
   - Since the diagonal bisects the right angle, the angle \( y \) between the diagonal and a side is half of 90 degrees.
   - Therefore, \( y = 45^\circ \).

Based on these calculations, the correct answer is \( y = 45^\circ \).

Solution Section:
The angle \( y \) is 45 degrees.
