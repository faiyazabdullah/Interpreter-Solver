Let's analyze the geometric figure step by step:

1. We are given that \( A B = 30 \) and \( C D = 30 \).
2. We also know that the measure of arc \( \widehat{CZ} \) is 40 degrees.
3. We need to find the measure of arc \( \widehat{CD} \).

From the properties of circles:
- The measure of an arc is directly proportional to the measure of the central angle that intercepts it.
- Since \( AB \) and \( CD \) are equal chords, they subtend equal arcs. Therefore, the arc \( \widehat{AB} \) is also 30 degrees.
- Given that arc \( \widehat{CZ} \) is 40 degrees, we need to determine the remaining part of the circle.

Since the total circumference of the circle is \( 360^\circ \), the remaining arc \( \widehat{CD} \) can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Remaining arc } \widehat{CD} = 360^\circ - (\text{arc } \widehat{CZ} + \text{arc } \widehat{AB}) \]
\[ \text{Remaining arc } \widehat{CD} = 360^\circ - (40^\circ + 30^\circ) \]
\[ \text{Remaining arc } \widehat{CD} = 360^\circ - 70^\circ \]
\[ \text{Remaining arc } \widehat{CD} = 290^\circ \]

However, since the problem states that the measure of arc \( \widehat{CD} \) is required and the options provided are simpler, let's re-evaluate the simpler approach considering the symmetry and equal chord lengths:
- If \( AB \) and \( CD \) are equal chords, and the circle is symmetric, then the remaining arc \( \widehat{CD} \) would be the same as the arc intercepted by the chord \( AB \).

Thus, the measure of arc \( \widehat{CD} \) should be the same as the measure of arc \( \widehat{AB} \), which is 30 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of arc \( \widehat{CD} \) is 30 degrees.

Solution:
Based on the analysis, the measure of arc \( \widehat{CD} \) is 30 degrees.
