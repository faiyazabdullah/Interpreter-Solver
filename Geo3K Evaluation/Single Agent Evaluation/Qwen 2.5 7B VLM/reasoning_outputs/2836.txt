To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometric relationships between the circles and the lengths involved.

1. **Identify the given information**: We know that circles G, J, and K intersect at point L, and GH = 10.
2. **Analyze the figure**: The points L, G, H, and J appear to be significant since they are intersection points. Given the symmetry and the fact that these points lie on different circles, it suggests a relationship involving chords or radii of the circles.
3. **Understand the problem**: We need to find JL. Since there's no direct measurement for JL given or derived from the information provided, we need to consider the geometric properties of the circles.

Given the symmetry and the fact that the circles are intersecting at point L, we can infer that the length JL would be half the length of GH because L is the intersection point and the circles are symmetrically placed around L. Therefore, JL would be equal to GH / 2.

4. **Calculate JL**:
   \[
   JL = \frac{GH}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5
   \]

5. **Compare with the answer choices**: The calculated value of JL is 5, which matches option A.

Final Answer: A
