Let's analyze the image step by step:

1. **Identify the Figure**: The image shows a circle with a point inside it labeled as \( A \). There is a line segment from \( A \) to another point outside the circle labeled as \( B \), which is perpendicular to the radius at point \( A \).

2. **Given Information**: The length of the line segment \( AB \) is given as 3 inches. Since \( AB \) is perpendicular to the radius at \( A \), it forms a right triangle where \( AB \) is the hypotenuse, and the radius \( OA \) is one of the legs of the triangle.

3. **Right Triangle Properties**: In the right triangle \( OAB \), \( OA \) is the radius of the circle, and \( AB \) is the distance from the center \( O \) to point \( B \). The radius is the perpendicular distance from the center to the chord, making \( OA \) the radius and the distance \( AB \) is the height of the triangle.

4. **Finding the Radius**: The radius of the circle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle \( OAB \). Let \( r \) be the radius of the circle. Then,
   \[
   AB^2 = OA^2 + OB^2
   \]
   Given \( AB = 3 \) inches, we need to find \( OA \). Since \( OA \) is the radius and \( OB \) is the hypotenuse, we have:
   \[
   3^2 = r^2 + r^2
   \]
   Simplifying this equation:
   \[
   9 = 2r^2
   \]
   Solving for \( r \):
   \[
   r^2 = \frac{9}{2}
   \]
   \[
   r = \sqrt{\frac{9}{2}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]

5. **Area of the Circle**: The area \( A \) of the circle is given by the formula:
   \[
   A = \pi r^2
   \]
   Substituting the value of \( r \):
   \[
   A = \pi \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2
   \]
   \[
   A = \pi \left( \frac{9 \cdot 2}{4} \right)
   \]
   \[
   A = \pi \left( \frac{18}{4} \right)
   \]
   \[
   A = \pi \left( \frac{9}{2} \right)
   \]
   \[
   A = \frac{9\pi}{2}
   \]

6. **Approximating the Area**: Using \( \pi \approx 3.14 \):
   \[
   A \approx \frac{9 \cdot 3.14}{2} = \frac{28.26}{2} = 14.13
   \]

7. **Comparing with Answer Choices**: The calculated area is approximately 14.13 square inches. The closest option to this value is 18.8.

Solution:
The area of the circle is approximately 14.13 square inches, which matches the closest option B.
