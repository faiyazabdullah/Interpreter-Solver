To solve for BC in the given triangle ABC, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Identify the given information**:
   - Triangle ABC is equilateral because AB = AC = BC.
   - All sides are equal in length, which means each side measures 9 units.

2. **Understand the question**:
   - We need to find the length of BC.

3. **Apply the properties of an equilateral triangle**:
   - By definition, an equilateral triangle has all sides of equal length and all internal angles equal to 60 degrees.

Since we know that AB = AC = BC = 9 units, it follows directly that BC = 9 units.

Now, let's compare our calculated result with the given answer choices:
- A. 6
- B. 9
- C. 15
- D. 60

The closest and correct answer choice is B.

Final Answer: B
