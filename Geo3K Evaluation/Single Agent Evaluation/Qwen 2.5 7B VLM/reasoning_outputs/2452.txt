To solve for the measure of angle 5, let's analyze the given information and the geometric relationships in the figure:

1. **Identify Given Angles**: We know that \( m \angle 1 = 58^\circ \), \( m \angle 2 = 47^\circ \), and \( m \angle 3 = 26^\circ \).

2. **Understand the Figure**: The figure appears to be a combination of triangles and possibly other geometric shapes. However, the key observation here is that angles 1, 2, and 3 form a linear pair with another angle which we need to find.

3. **Linear Pair Property**: The sum of angles forming a linear pair is always \( 180^\circ \). Therefore, we can find the measure of the angle adjacent to angle 3:
   \[
   m \angle 4 = 180^\circ - m \angle 3 = 180^\circ - 26^\circ = 154^\circ
   \]

4. **Sum of Angles in Triangle**: Since angle 5 is part of a triangle, we can use the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \). The triangle involving angles 4 and 5 has angle 4 already calculated as \( 154^\circ \).

5. **Find Angle 5**: To find angle 5, we use the sum of angles in the triangle:
   \[
   m \angle 5 + m \angle 6 + m \angle 4 = 180^\circ
   \]
   Since angle 4 is \( 154^\circ \):
   \[
   m \angle 5 + m \angle 6 + 154^\circ = 180^\circ
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   m \angle 5 + m \angle 6 = 180^\circ - 154^\circ = 26^\circ
   \]

6. **Conclusion**: Given the provided options, the only feasible angle value that fits within the constraints of the problem is \( 43^\circ \) (since \( 43^\circ \) is the closest value to the derived result of \( 26^\circ \)).
