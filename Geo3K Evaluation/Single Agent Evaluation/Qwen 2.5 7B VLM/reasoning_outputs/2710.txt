Let's analyze the given information and the geometric figure:

1. Quadrilateral WXYZ is a rectangle.
2. m∠1 = 30°.
3. We need to find the measure of ∠5.

In a rectangle:
- Opposite angles are equal.
- Adjacent angles add up to 180°.

Since ∠1 and ∠5 are adjacent angles in the rectangle:
- They form a straight line at point X, so they add up to 180°.

Given m∠1 = 30°:
- Therefore, m∠5 = 180° - 30° = 150°.

However, the problem asks for the measure of ∠5, but ∠5 appears to be part of a smaller triangle formed within the rectangle. Let's re-evaluate the triangle formed by ∠5 and its adjacent angle.

Since ∠5 is part of a smaller right triangle (as indicated by the perpendicular marks):
- The sum of angles in a right triangle is 180°.
- One angle is 90° (right angle).
- Another angle is 60° (as ∠5 forms a 60° angle with another side).

Thus, m∠5 = 30°.

Finally, compare the calculated result with the given answer choices:
A. 15
B. 30
C. 45
D. 60

The closest match is B. 30.
