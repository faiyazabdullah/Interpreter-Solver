Let's analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \( ZV = 1 \)
   - \( TW = 13 \)

2. **Understand the relationships:**
   - \( ZV \) and \( TW \) appear to be radii of the circle \(\odot T\).
   - Since both \( ZV \) and \( TW \) are radii of the same circle, they are equal in length.

3. **Calculate \( ZT \):**
   - Given \( ZV = 1 \), it follows that \( ZT = 1 \).

4. **Determine the diameter \( XY \):**
   - The line segment \( XY \) passes through the center \( T \) of the circle and is thus a diameter.
   - Since \( ZV \) is perpendicular to \( TW \) at point \( V \), we can infer that \( ZV \) and \( TW \) form a right triangle \( \triangle ZVT \).

5. **Use the Pythagorean theorem:**
   - In \( \triangle ZVT \):
     \[
     ZV^2 + VT^2 = ZT^2
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     1^2 + VT^2 = 1^2
     \]
     \[
     1 + VT^2 = 1
     \]
     \[
     VT^2 = 0
     \]
     \[
     VT = 0
     \]

6. **Calculate \( XY \):**
   - Since \( XY \) is a diameter and \( VT = 0 \), the length of \( XY \) is twice the radius \( ZT \):
     \[
     XY = 2 \times ZT = 2 \times 1 = 2
     \]

However, we notice that the problem setup seems to involve a different interpretation or a different geometric configuration than initially thought. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the given choices.

Given the choices:
- A. 5
- B. 10
- C. 12
- D. 13

Since our calculation shows \( XY = 2 \), which does not match any of the given choices, we need to reconsider the problem context. 

Upon re-evaluating, the problem might be misinterpreted or the choices might have been misaligned with the geometric figure. Given the choices, the closest value to our calculated result of 2 is not among them. 

Considering the problem constraints and the closest possible match, we select the closest option which is:
