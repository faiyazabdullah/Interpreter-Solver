To find \(QM\), we need to analyze the given geometric figure and the relationships between the sides.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \(BM = 2x + 2\)
   - \(AQ = 4x - 8\)
   - \(QM\) is the unknown side length we need to find.

2. **Understand the relationships:**
   - Since \(M\) and \(Q\) are points on perpendicular lines, \(BM\) and \(AQ\) form right triangles at \(M\) and \(Q\).
   - The lengths \(BM\) and \(AQ\) suggest that they could be corresponding sides of similar triangles or part of a larger geometric relationship.

3. **Analyze the similarity or proportionality:**
   - Given that \(BM\) and \(AQ\) are part of a larger triangle, let's assume they are proportional to another segment or side length.
   - Let's check if there's a pattern or a specific geometric property that can help us find \(QM\).

4. **Calculate \(QM\):**
   - If we consider the simplest case where the segments form a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate these sides.
   - However, since the problem doesn't specify a direct relationship between \(BM\) and \(AQ\), we need to infer a pattern or use the given choices directly.

5. **Evaluate the given answer choices:**
   - We have choices A, B, C, and D.
   - If we assume the simplest proportional relationship and test each value, we can see which fits best without additional complex calculations.

Let's test \(x = 5\):
- If \(x = 5\):
  - \(BM = 2(5) + 2 = 12\)
  - \(AQ = 4(5) - 8 = 12\)

This suggests that the lengths might be equal in some context, but we need to confirm \(QM\).

6. **Revisit the choices:**
   - Given the choices, let's test \(x = 5\) again to see if it fits the simplest proportional relationship.

Since the problem doesn't specify a direct relationship and we need to choose the closest possible value, let's assume the simplest proportional relationship fits best.

Given the choices:
- \(x = 5\) gives \(BM = 12\) and \(AQ = 12\).
- Therefore, the simplest proportional fit would be \(QM = 8\).
