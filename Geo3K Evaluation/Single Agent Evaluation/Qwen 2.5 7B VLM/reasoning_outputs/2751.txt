To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given geometric relationships and use the information provided to find the measure of angle \( \angle YIZ \).

### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
- We know that \( \frac{IJ}{XJ} = \frac{HJ}{YJ} \). This suggests that triangles \( \triangle IJX \) and \( \triangle HJY \) are similar by the Side-Splitter Theorem or some form of similarity criterion.
- \( m\angle WXJ = 130^\circ \).
- \( m\angle WZG = 20^\circ \).

### Step 2: Determine the Relationship Between Angles
Since \( WX \parallel YZ \), angles \( WXJ \) and \( YJZ \) are corresponding angles and thus equal. Therefore, \( m\angle YJZ = 130^\circ \).

### Step 3: Use the Given Angle \( m\angle WZG = 20^\circ \)
This angle appears to be part of the triangle formed by points \( W, Z, \) and \( G \). However, it does not directly help us find \( \angle YIZ \). Instead, it might be used to find another angle in the diagram.

### Step 4: Calculate \( \angle YIZ \)
Given the similarity of triangles, we can infer that the angles around point \( J \) sum up correctly. Specifically, since \( WX \parallel YZ \), the angles at \( J \) must complement each other properly.

### Step 5: Find the Measure of \( \angle YIZ \)
Since \( m\angle WXJ = 130^\circ \), the supplementary angle at \( YJZ \) would be:
\[ 180^\circ - 130^\circ = 50^\circ. \]

Thus, \( m\angle YIZ = 50^\circ \).

Solution:

Based on the analysis, the measure of \( \angle YIZ \) is \( 50^\circ \).
