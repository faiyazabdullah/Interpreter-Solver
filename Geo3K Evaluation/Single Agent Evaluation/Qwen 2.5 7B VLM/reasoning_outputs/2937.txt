Let's analyze the given geometric figure:

1. We have a triangle labeled ABC.
2. Side AC is given as 9 units.
3. Side BC is labeled as \( x \).
4. Side AB is given as 15 units.
5. There is a right angle at vertex C, which means triangle ABC is a right triangle with ∠ACB = 90°.

Since triangle ABC is a right triangle with the hypotenuse AB being 15 units, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of side BC (\( x \)).

The Pythagorean theorem states:
\[ AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ 15^2 = 9^2 + x^2 \]
\[ 225 = 81 + x^2 \]
\[ x^2 = 225 - 81 \]
\[ x^2 = 144 \]
\[ x = \sqrt{144} \]
\[ x = 12 \]

So, the length of side BC is 12 units.

Now let's compare our calculated result with the given answer choices:
A. 10
B. 11
C. 12
D. 13

The closest value to our calculated answer (12) is option C.
