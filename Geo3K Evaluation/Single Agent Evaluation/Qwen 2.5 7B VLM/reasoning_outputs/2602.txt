QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
<think>
First, let's analyze the given geometric figure:

1. The figure is a triangle with vertices A, B, and C.
2. Angle at vertex B is labeled as \(x^\circ\).
3. Angle at vertex C is labeled as \((2x)^\circ\).
4. Angle at vertex A is a right angle, which means it measures \(90^\circ\).

Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is always \(180^\circ\), we can set up the following equation:

\[ x + (2x) + 90 = 180 \]

Now, let's solve for \(x\):

\[ x + 2x + 90 = 180 \]
\[ 3x + 90 = 180 \]
\[ 3x = 180 - 90 \]
\[ 3x = 90 \]
\[ x = \frac{90}{3} \]
\[ x = 30 \]

So, the value of \(x\) is \(30^\circ\).

Comparing this with the given answer choices:
A. 10
B. 20
C. 30
D. 40

The closest and most accurate answer is C.
