To find \( m \angle 2 \), let's analyze the geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify Key Elements**: 
   - There is a circle with points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \) on its circumference.
   - Line segments connect these points forming various angles.

2. **Analyze Angles**:
   - Since \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \) are points on the circle, they form a cyclic quadrilateral.
   - In a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles sum up to 180 degrees.

3. **Summarize Given Information**:
   - We need to find \( m \angle 2 \).
   - From the diagram, we can see that \( \angle 2 \) is part of the angle subtended by arc \( BD \).

4. **Geometric Theorem Application**:
   - According to the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts.
   - Here, \( \angle 2 \) intercepts arc \( BD \).

5. **Measure Arc \( BD \)**:
   - By examining the diagram, arc \( BD \) appears to be a right angle (90 degrees).
   - Therefore, the measure of \( \angle 2 \), which intercepts arc \( BD \), would be half of 90 degrees.

6. **Calculate \( m \angle 2 \)**:
   - \( m \angle 2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 90^\circ = 45^\circ \).

Based on the analysis, the measure of \( \angle 2 \) is 45 degrees.
