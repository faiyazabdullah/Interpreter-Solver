To find the area of the figure, we need to recognize the shape it forms. The figure appears to be a trapezoid because it has one pair of parallel sides (DC and AB). The lengths of these parallel sides are given as DC = 48 ft and AB = 53 ft. The height of the trapezoid is also given as 48 ft.

The formula for the area of a trapezoid is:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{Base}_1 + \text{Base}_2) \times \text{Height} \]

Here, Base\_1 = DC = 48 ft, Base\_2 = AB = 53 ft, and Height = 48 ft. Plugging these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (48 + 53) \times 48 \]
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 101 \times 48 \]
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4848 \]
\[ \text{Area} = 2424 \]

Now, let's compare our calculated area with the given answer choices:
A. 191.5
B. 1128
C. 2256
D. 4512

Our calculated area is 2424, which is closest to option C (2256).
