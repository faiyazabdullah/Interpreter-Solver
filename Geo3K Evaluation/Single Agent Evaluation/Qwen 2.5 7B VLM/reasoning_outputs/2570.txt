First, let's analyze the given geometric figure. We have a circle centered at point \(M\) with radius \(x\). Point \(K\) lies on the circumference of the circle and is the point of tangency between the circle and line \(KL\). Line \(KL\) is tangent to the circle at point \(K\).

Given:
- \(KL = 17\)
- \(ML = 10\)

Since \(KL\) is tangent to the circle at point \(K\), the radius \(MK\) is perpendicular to \(KL\) at point \(K\). Therefore, triangle \(MKL\) forms a right triangle with the right angle at \(K\).

We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(MK\):

\[ MK^2 + KL^2 = ML^2 \]

Substitute the known values:

\[ x^2 + 17^2 = 10^2 \]
\[ x^2 + 289 = 100 \]
\[ x^2 = 100 - 289 \]
\[ x^2 = 100 - 289 \]
\[ x^2 = 9 \]
\[ x = \sqrt{9} \]
\[ x = 3 \]

Now, we need to compare our calculated value with the given answer choices:
- A. 6.00
- B. 9.45
- C. 18.9
- D. 37.8

The closest value to our calculated \(x\) is 3.00, which matches none of the exact choices. However, since we are instructed to select the closest option, we choose the closest available answer.

Final Answer: B
