To solve for \(CE\), we need to use the given lengths and the relationships between the segments in the triangle. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. **Identify Given Information:**
   - \(CE = t - 2\)
   - \(EB = t + 1\)
   - \(CD = 2\)
   - \(CA = 10\)

2. **Understand the Relationships:**
   Since the problem does not provide direct relationships between these segments (like parallelism or similar triangles), we need to consider the simplest geometric configuration which could be a triangle. 

3. **Assume a Triangle Configuration:**
   Let's assume \( \triangle ABC \) with \(D\) and \(E\) being points inside the triangle such that \(D\) and \(E\) are on \(CA\) and \(CB\) respectively.

4. **Calculate \(CE\):**
   We know \(CE = t - 2\) and \(EB = t + 1\). To find \(t\), we can use the fact that \(CA = 10\) and the total length of \(CE\) plus \(EB\) must fit within the constraints of the triangle.

5. **Summation of Segments:**
   Since \(CA = CE + EB\):
   \[
   t - 2 + (t + 1) = 10
   \]
   Simplifying the equation:
   \[
   2t - 1 = 10
   \]
   Solving for \(t\):
   \[
   2t = 11 \implies t = \frac{11}{2} = 5.5
   \]

6. **Find \(CE\):**
   Using \(t = 5.5\):
   \[
   CE = t - 2 = 5.5 - 2 = 3.5
   \]

Since the closest answer choice to 3.5 is 3, we select:
