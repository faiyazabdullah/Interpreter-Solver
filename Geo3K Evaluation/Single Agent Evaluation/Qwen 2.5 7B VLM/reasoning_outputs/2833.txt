Let's analyze the given geometric figure and the problem statement step-by-step:

1. **Identify the given information**:
   - K is the centroid of triangle \( \triangle CDF \).
   - \( DK = 16 \).

2. **Understand the centroid property**:
   - The centroid (K) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex.
   - Therefore, \( DK \) is a median of the triangle \( \triangle CDF \).

3. **Apply the centroid property**:
   - Since K divides the median \( DK \) in the ratio 2:1, we can write:
     \[
     CK = 2 \cdot DK
     \]
   - Given \( DK = 16 \), we have:
     \[
     CK = 2 \cdot 16 = 32
     \]

4. **Find the length of \( CD \)**:
   - The length \( CD \) is twice the length of \( CK \) because \( K \) is the midpoint of \( CD \) due to the centroid property.
   - Therefore:
     \[
     CD = 2 \cdot CK = 2 \cdot 32 = 64
     \]

5. **Check the answer choices**:
   - The given answer choices are A. 9, B. 12, C. 18, D. 18.
   - Our calculated value \( CD = 64 \) does not match any of these choices.

6. **Select the closest option**:
   - Since none of the choices match our calculated value, we need to choose the closest one.
   - The closest value to 64 among the given choices is 9.

Final Answer: A
