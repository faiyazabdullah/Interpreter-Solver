To determine the area of parallelogram \(ABCD\), we need to use the formula for the area of a parallelogram, which is given by the base times the height. Here are the steps:

1. **Identify the base and height of the parallelogram:**
   - The base \(AD\) is given as 10 meters.
   - The height corresponding to the base \(AD\) is the perpendicular distance from point \(B\) to line \(AD\), which is given as 6 meters.

2. **Apply the formula for the area of a parallelogram:**
   \[
   \text{Area} = \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Area} = 10 \, \text{meters} \times 6 \, \text{meters} = 60 \, \text{square meters}
   \]

3. **Compare the calculated area with the given answer choices:**
   - The calculated area is 60 square meters.
   - The answer choices are A (24), B (30), C (48), and D (60).

Since the calculated area matches the value in choice D, the correct answer is:
