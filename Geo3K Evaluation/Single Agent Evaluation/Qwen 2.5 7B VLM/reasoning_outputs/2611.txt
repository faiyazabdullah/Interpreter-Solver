CHOICES:
A. 18
B. 32
C. 36
D. 58

Let's start by analyzing the given information:

1. \(\overrightarrow{QP}\) and \(\overrightarrow{QR}\) are opposite rays, meaning they form a straight line at point \(Q\).
2. \(\overrightarrow{QT}\) bisects \(\angle SQR\).
3. The measure of \(\angle SQR\) is given as \(6x + 8\).
4. The measure of \(\angle TQR\) is given as \(4x - 14\).

Since \(\overrightarrow{QT}\) bisects \(\angle SQR\), we know that:
\[
m\angle SQR = m\angle TQR
\]

Substitute the given expressions for these angles:
\[
6x + 8 = 4x - 14
\]

Now, solve for \(x\):
\[
6x + 8 = 4x - 14
\]
\[
6x - 4x = -14 - 8
\]
\[
2x = -22
\]
\[
x = -11
\]

Next, calculate the measures of \(\angle SQR\) and \(\angle TQR\):
\[
m\angle SQR = 6(-11) + 8 = -66 + 8 = -58
\]
\[
m\angle TQR = 4(-11) - 14 = -44 - 14 = -58
\]

Since both angles are equal, we can use either angle to find \(\angle SQT\). However, we need to find the sum of \(\angle SQR\) and \(\angle TQR\) because:
\[
m\angle SQT = m\angle SQR + m\angle TQR
\]
\[
m\angle SQT = -58 + (-58) = -116
\]

Since the problem involves finding the positive measure of the angles formed within the straight line, we take the absolute value:
\[
m\angle SQT = 116
\]

Given the choices provided:
A. 18
B. 32
C. 36
D. 58

The closest value to 116 among the choices is 112, but since none of the choices match, we select the closest option provided.

Final Answer: D</think>

<solution>
Since the calculated angle measure of 116 does not match any of the provided choices, we select the closest value among the given choices.

Final Answer: D</solution>
