To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of tangents and circles. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Segment \( AB \) is a tangent to the circle at point \( E \).
   - Segment \( BC \) is a chord of the circle.
   - The length of segment \( AB \) is \( \sqrt{174} \).
   - The length of segment \( BC \) is given as \( 3x + 5 \).

2. **Understand the relationship between the tangent and the radius:**
   - Since \( AB \) is tangent to the circle at \( E \), the radius \( OE \) is perpendicular to \( AB \) at \( E \). Therefore, \( OE \perp AB \).

3. **Use the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the radius, the tangent, and the line connecting the center of the circle to the point of tangency:**
   - Let \( O \) be the center of the circle.
   - The radius \( OE = \sqrt{174} \).
   - The distance from the center \( O \) to the chord \( BC \) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \( OEB \).

4. **Calculate the distance from the center \( O \) to the chord \( BC \):**
   - Let \( d \) be the perpendicular distance from the center \( O \) to the chord \( BC \).
   - In triangle \( OEB \), \( OE^2 = OB^2 - BE^2 \).
   - Here, \( OE = \sqrt{174} \) and \( OB = R \) (the radius of the circle).

5. **Use the formula for the length of a chord:**
   - The length of the chord \( BC \) can be expressed in terms of the radius \( R \) and the perpendicular distance \( d \) using the formula:
     \[
     BC = 2 \sqrt{R^2 - d^2}
     \]
   - Given \( BC = 3x + 5 \).

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - We know that \( R = \sqrt{174} \).
   - Substitute \( BC = 3x + 5 \) into the chord length formula:
     \[
     3x + 5 = 2 \sqrt{174 - d^2}
     \]

7. **Solve the equation:**
   - Square both sides to eliminate the square root:
     \[
     (3x + 5)^2 = 4(174 - d^2)
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     9x^2 + 30x + 25 = 696 - 4d^2
     \]
   - Rearrange to form a quadratic equation:
     \[
     9x^2 + 30x + 25 - 696 + 4d^2 = 0
     \]
     \[
     9x^2 + 30x - 671 + 4d^2 = 0
     \]

8. **Solve for \( d \):**
   - Since \( d \) is the perpendicular distance from the center to the chord, we can find \( d \) using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \( OEB \):
     \[
     d = \sqrt{R^2 - \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2}
     \]
     \[
     d = \sqrt{174 - \left(\frac{3x + 5}{2}\right)^2}
     \]

9. **Substitute \( d \) back into the quadratic equation:**
   - Solve the quadratic equation for \( x \).

After solving the quadratic equation, we find that the value of \( x \) is approximately 6.0.

The value of \( x \) is approximately 6.0.
