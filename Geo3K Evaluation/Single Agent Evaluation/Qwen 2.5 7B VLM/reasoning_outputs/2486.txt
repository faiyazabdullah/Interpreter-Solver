Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify Given Information:**
   - Circle O has a radius of 13 inches.
   - Radius OB is perpendicular to chord CD which is 24 inches long.
   - The measure of arc CD (m \widehat{CD}) is 134 degrees.

2. **Understand the Geometry:**
   - Since OB is perpendicular to CD, it bisects CD at point X. Therefore, CX = XD = 12 inches (half of 24 inches).
   - Because OB is perpendicular to CD, triangle OXB forms a right triangle with OB as the hypotenuse.

3. **Calculate the Measure of Arc CB:**
   - We know that the total circumference of the circle is \(2\pi r = 2\pi \times 13 = 26\pi\) inches.
   - The measure of arc CD is given as 134 degrees.
   - Since OB bisects CD, the remaining arc CB will be the rest of the circle minus arc CD.
   - The measure of arc CB can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Measure of arc CB} = \text{Total measure of the circle} - \text{Measure of arc CD}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Measure of arc CB} = 360^\circ - 134^\circ = 226^\circ
     \]

4. **Compare with Given Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated measure of arc CB is 226 degrees.
   - The closest answer choice to 226 degrees among the given options is not directly available. However, we need to select the closest option from A, B, C, or D.

Given the options:
- A. 24
- B. 33
- C. 67
- D. 134

Since none of these options match our calculation precisely, we should choose the closest reasonable answer.

Final Answer: C
