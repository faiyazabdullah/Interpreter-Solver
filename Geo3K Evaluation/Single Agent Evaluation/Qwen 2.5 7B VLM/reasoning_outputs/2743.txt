To solve for \(x\) in the given triangle, we need to use the Law of Sines and some basic trigonometric properties. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identify Known Values**:
   - Angle at vertex A: \(60^\circ\)
   - Side opposite to angle A: \(11\)
   - Side opposite to angle B (which we need to find): \(12\)

2. **Apply the Law of Sines**:
   \[
   \frac{\sin A}{a} = \frac{\sin B}{b}
   \]
   Where:
   - \(A = 60^\circ\)
   - \(a = 11\)
   - \(b = 12\)
   - We need to find angle B (\(B\)).

3. **Substitute the Known Values**:
   \[
   \frac{\sin 60^\circ}{11} = \frac{\sin B}{12}
   \]

4. **Calculate \(\sin 60^\circ\)**:
   \[
   \sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
   \]

5. **Set up the equation**:
   \[
   \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{11} = \frac{\sin B}{12}
   \]

6. **Solve for \(\sin B\)**:
   \[
   \sin B = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times 12}{11} = \frac{6\sqrt{3}}{11}
   \]

7. **Calculate \(\sin B\)**:
   \[
   \sin B \approx \frac{6 \times 1.732}{11} \approx \frac{10.392}{11} \approx 0.945
   \]

8. **Find the angle B**:
   \[
   B = \sin^{-1}(0.945) \approx 70.3^\circ
   \]

Since the sum of angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\), we can find angle C:
\[
C = 180^\circ - A - B = 180^\circ - 60^\circ - 70.3^\circ = 49.7^\circ
\]

However, the problem asks for angle B, which we have already calculated as approximately \(70.3^\circ\).

Given the answer choices:
A. 49.5
B. 52.5
C. 55.5
D. 58.5

The closest value to \(70.3^\circ\) is 70.3 degrees, which does not match any of the provided choices directly. Therefore, we must round to the nearest tenth, which would be 70.3 degrees, but since it is not listed, we choose the closest option which is B.
