First, let's analyze the given information:

1. We have two polygons that are similar.
2. The left polygon has sides RT = 15, RS = 20.7, ST = 10, and angles RST = 27째, STR = 43째, SRT = 110째.
3. The right polygon has side EF = 11.25 and angle EFG = 27째.
4. We need to find the length GF.

Since the polygons are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional. Therefore, we can set up the proportion using the known lengths and angles.

The ratio of the sides can be found by comparing the sides RT and EF, which are corresponding sides:
\[ \frac{RT}{EF} = \frac{15}{11.25} \]

Now, we need to find the length GF corresponding to ST in the left polygon. Using the similarity ratio:
\[ \frac{GF}{ST} = \frac{11.25}{15} \]

Let's calculate the ratio:
\[ \frac{11.25}{15} = 0.75 \]

So,
\[ GF = 0.75 \times ST = 0.75 \times 10 = 7.5 \]

Thus, the length GF is 7.5.

Solution:
The length GF is 7.5.
