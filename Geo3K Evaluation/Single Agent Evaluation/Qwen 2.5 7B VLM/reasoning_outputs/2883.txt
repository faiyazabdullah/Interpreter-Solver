First, let's analyze the given information and the geometric relationships in the figure:

1. The figure appears to be a rectangle (since opposite sides are equal and parallel).
2. There are right angles at vertices Y, X, T, and W.
3. Angles at vertices Y and X are given as 52° and 38° respectively.
4. Angle ZYX is the angle we need to find, labeled as m∠3.

Since the sum of angles around point Z (which lies inside the rectangle) forms a straight line, we can use the property that the sum of angles on a straight line is 180°.

Now, let's calculate m∠3:
- Angle YZT is the supplementary angle to angle YZX because they form a straight line. Therefore, angle YZT = 180° - 52° = 128°.
- Since Z is the intersection of the diagonals of the rectangle, it divides the rectangle into four triangles of equal area, implying symmetry.

Given that the sum of angles at point Z is 180°, we can deduce:
- m∠3 = 180° - 128° = 52°.

Finally, compare our calculated result with the given answer choices:
- A. 28
- B. 38
- C. 52
- D. 62

The closest match to our calculation is C.
