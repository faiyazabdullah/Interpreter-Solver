<think>
First, let's analyze the given geometric figure. We have a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with the following information:

- Side \( AB = 33 \)
- Side \( BC = 66 \)
- Side \( AC = x \)

We need to find the length of side \( AC \), which is marked as \( x \).

Since there are no right angles or specific angles given, we cannot immediately apply trigonometric ratios like sine, cosine, or tangent. However, we can check if the triangle might be special cases like a 30-60-90 triangle, a 45-45-90 triangle, or another type of triangle where the lengths might fit a known pattern.

Given the sides \( AB = 33 \) and \( BC = 66 \), it appears that \( BC \) is twice the length of \( AB \). This suggests a possible 30-60-90 triangle relationship because in a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio \( 1 : \sqrt{3} : 2 \).

In a 30-60-90 triangle:
- The side opposite the 30-degree angle is half the hypotenuse.
- The side opposite the 60-degree angle is \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \) times the hypotenuse.
- The hypotenuse is twice the side opposite the 30-degree angle.

Here, if we consider \( AB \) as the side opposite the 30-degree angle, then the hypotenuse \( BC = 66 \) would be twice \( AB = 33 \). Therefore, \( AC \) (the side opposite the 60-degree angle) would be \( 33\sqrt{3} \).

Let's calculate:
\[ AC = 33\sqrt{3} \]

Now, let's compare this with the given answer choices:
A. \( 33 \)
B. \( 33\sqrt{2} \)
C. \( 33\sqrt{3} \)
D. \( 33\sqrt{5} \)

The correct answer is \( 33\sqrt{3} \).

Final Answer: C</think>

<solution>
To find \( x \), we recognize that the triangle \( \triangle ABC \) forms a 30-60-90 triangle with \( AB \) as the side opposite the 30-degree angle. Therefore, the length of \( AC \) (opposite the 60-degree angle) is:

\[ AC = 33\sqrt{3} \]

Comparing with the given answer choices:
A. \( 33 \)
B. \( 33\sqrt{2} \)
C. \( 33\sqrt{3} \)
D. \( 33\sqrt{5} \)

The correct answer is \( 33\sqrt{3} \).

Final Answer: C</solution>
