Let's analyze the given information and the geometric relationships step by step:

1. **Rectangle J K L M**: All angles in a rectangle are right angles (90 degrees). Therefore, ∠JMK = 90 degrees.
2. **Rhombus M L P R**: All sides of a rhombus are equal, and opposite angles are equal. Given ∠JMK = 55 degrees, we can infer that ∠JML = 55 degrees because ∠JMK and ∠JML are adjacent angles forming a straight line.
3. **Given Angles**:
   - ∠JMK = 55 degrees
   - ∠MRP = 70 degrees
4. **Finding ∠KLP**:
   - Since JMK and MLP are supplementary angles (they form a straight line), ∠KMP = 180 - 55 = 125 degrees.
   - In triangle KML, the sum of the angles is 180 degrees. We know ∠KLM = 55 degrees and ∠KML = 90 degrees (from the rectangle).
   - Therefore, ∠KLM = 180 - 90 - 55 = 35 degrees.
   - Since ∠KLP and ∠KLM are adjacent angles forming a straight line, ∠KLP = 180 - 35 = 145 degrees.

Now, let's compare our calculated angle with the given answer choices.

Solution:
Based on the analysis, the measure of ∠KLP is 145 degrees. Comparing this with the given answer choices:

A. 20
B. 110
C. 140
D. 160

The closest match is option C, which is 140 degrees.

Final Answer: C
