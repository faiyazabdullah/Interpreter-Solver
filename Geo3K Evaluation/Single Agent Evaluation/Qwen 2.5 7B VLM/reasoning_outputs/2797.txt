Let's analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \( RL = 5 \)
   - \( RT = 9 \)
   - \( WS = 6 \)

2. **Understand the relationships:**
   - The figure appears to be a triangle \( RLT \) with a segment \( RW \) connecting vertex \( R \) to point \( W \).
   - \( RW \) seems to be part of the triangle, but there is no direct relationship provided between \( RW \), \( RL \), \( RT \), and \( WS \).

3. **Determine the type of triangle or segment:**
   - Since we do not have any specific angle or side length information linking \( RW \) directly to the sides \( RL \) and \( RT \), we need to consider if there might be a specific geometric property or theorem that could help us.

4. **Check for a possible application of the Pythagorean theorem:**
   - The Pythagorean theorem applies to right triangles. Here, we don't have a clear indication of a right angle at \( W \), so it's unlikely this theorem can be directly applied.

5. **Consider the given choices:**
   - We need to find the value of \( RW \) among the choices: A. 5.4, B. 6, C. 6.6, D. 7.5.

6. **Calculate \( RW \):**
   - Given the lengths \( RL = 5 \) and \( RT = 9 \), and knowing these form a triangle with some unknown side \( RW \), we can use the formula for the length of the median of a triangle (which could be applicable here since \( RW \) seems to be a median):
     \[
     RW = \frac{RT + RL}{2} = \frac{9 + 5}{2} = \frac{14}{2} = 7
     \]
   - However, this calculation does not match any of the given choices.

7. **Re-evaluate the problem:**
   - Since none of the given lengths or the calculated median length matches the choices, we need to consider if there's another geometric relationship or property that might be applicable.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the lack of direct geometric properties linking the segments, and considering the closest reasonable value to the calculated 7, the most plausible choice is likely to be the closest option to our calculated value.

<solution>
After careful analysis, the closest value to the calculated median length of 7 is:
