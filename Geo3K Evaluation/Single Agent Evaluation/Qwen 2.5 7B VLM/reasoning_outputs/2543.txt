<think>
To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of similar triangles. Given that \(\triangle BCD \sim \triangle FDE\), the corresponding sides of these triangles are proportional. We are provided with the lengths \(CD = 12\), \(FD = 5\), \(FE = 4\), and \(DE = 8\).

First, let's set up the proportion between the corresponding sides:

\[
\frac{BC}{FE} = \frac{BD}{FD} = \frac{CD}{DE}
\]

From the given information, we can see that the ratio between \(CD\) and \(DE\) is:

\[
\frac{CD}{DE} = \frac{12}{8} = \frac{3}{2}
\]

Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of their corresponding sides should be equal. Therefore, we can write:

\[
\frac{BC}{4} = \frac{BD}{5} = \frac{12}{8} = \frac{3}{2}
\]

Using the ratio \(\frac{3}{2}\), we can find the lengths of \(BC\) and \(BD\):

\[
BC = 4 \times \frac{3}{2} = 6
\]
\[
BD = 5 \times \frac{3}{2} = 7.5
\]

Now, we can calculate the perimeter of \(\triangle BCD\):

\[
\text{Perimeter of } \triangle BCD = BC + BD + CD = 6 + 7.5 + 12 = 25.5
\]

Thus, the perimeter of \(\triangle BCD\) is \(25.5\).

<Solution>
The perimeter of \(\triangle BCD\) is \(25.5\).
