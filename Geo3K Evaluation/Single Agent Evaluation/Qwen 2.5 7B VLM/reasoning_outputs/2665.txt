To solve for \( x \) in the given geometric figure, we need to use the property of similar triangles. Similar triangles have corresponding sides that are proportional.

Given:
- The larger triangle has sides of lengths 12, \( y + 4 \), and 20.
- The smaller triangle has sides of lengths 12, 15, and \( 2x \).

Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of their corresponding sides are equal.

First, let's set up the proportion for the sides:

\[
\frac{12}{12} = \frac{y + 4}{15} = \frac{20}{2x}
\]

We can simplify the first part of the proportion:

\[
\frac{12}{12} = 1
\]

So the equation simplifies to:

\[
1 = \frac{y + 4}{15}
\]

From this, we can solve for \( y \):

\[
y + 4 = 15
\]
\[
y = 11
\]

Now, we use the second part of the proportion to find \( x \):

\[
\frac{12}{20} = \frac{15}{2x}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
12 \cdot 2x = 20 \cdot 15
\]
\[
24x = 300
\]
\[
x = \frac{300}{24}
\]
\[
x = 12.5
\]

Since \( x \) must be a whole number, and the closest option to 12.5 is 12, we select the closest option.
