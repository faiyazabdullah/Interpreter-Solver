First, let's analyze the given information:

1. \(\triangle WZX \sim \triangle SRT\)
2. \(ST = 6\)
3. \(WX = 5\)
4. The perimeter of \(\triangle SRT\) is 15.

Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of their corresponding sides are equal. Therefore, we can set up the ratio of the sides:

\[
\frac{WX}{ST} = \frac{WZ}{SR} = \frac{ZX}{RT}
\]

Given \(WX = 5\) and \(ST = 6\), the ratio of the sides is:

\[
\frac{5}{6}
\]

Next, we need to find the perimeter of \(\triangle WZX\). The perimeter of \(\triangle WZX\) is \(WZ + ZX + WX\).

We know:
- \(WX = 5\)
- Let \(WZ = 5k\) and \(ZX = 6k\) for some constant \(k\).

The perimeter of \(\triangle WZX\) is:
\[
WZ + ZX + WX = 5k + 6k + 5 = 11k + 5
\]

Since the ratio of the sides is \(\frac{5}{6}\), we can find \(k\) by comparing the perimeters. The perimeter of \(\triangle SRT\) is given as 15, so:
\[
SR + RT + ST = 15
\]
Let \(SR = 5m\) and \(RT = 6m\), then:
\[
5m + 6m + 6 = 15 \implies 11m + 6 = 15 \implies 11m = 9 \implies m = \frac{9}{11}
\]

Now, substituting back to find \(k\):
\[
WZ = 5k = 5 \times \frac{9}{11} = \frac{45}{11}
\]
\[
ZX = 6k = 6 \times \frac{9}{11} = \frac{54}{11}
\]

Thus, the perimeter of \(\triangle WZX\) is:
\[
11k + 5 = 11 \times \frac{9}{11} + 5 = 9 + 5 = 14
\]

However, we need to check the closest answer choice. The closest value among the given options is 13.
