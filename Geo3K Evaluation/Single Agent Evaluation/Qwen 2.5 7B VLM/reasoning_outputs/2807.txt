Let's analyze the geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the given information**: We have a circle with points \(A\), \(C\), \(E\), \(D\), and \(B\) marked on it. There is a line segment \(CE\) which intersects the circle at point \(E\). The lengths \(CE = 3\) and \(EB = 6\) are given.

2. **Understand the relationship**: Since \(E\) is a point on the circle, and \(CE\) and \(EB\) are segments forming a straight line passing through the circle, we can use the property of intersecting chords theorem. According to this theorem, if two chords intersect inside a circle, then the product of the lengths of the two parts of one chord equals the product of the lengths of the two parts of the other chord.

3. **Apply the intersecting chords theorem**: Let the length of \(AE\) be denoted as \(x\). According to the theorem:
   \[
   CE \cdot EB = AE \cdot ED
   \]
   Given values are \(CE = 3\), \(EB = 6\), and \(ED = 4\). Plugging these values into the equation:
   \[
   3 \cdot 6 = x \cdot 4
   \]

4. **Solve for \(x\)**:
   \[
   18 = 4x
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{18}{4} = 4.5
   \]

However, since the answer choices provided are integers (2, 3, 4, 6), and our calculated value is 4.5, we need to select the closest integer value from the choices.

5. **Select the closest answer choice**: The closest integer to 4.5 among the given choices is 4.

Final Answer: C
