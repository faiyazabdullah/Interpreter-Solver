Let's analyze the given geometric figure and the provided information:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \( F H \cong F L \)
   - \( FK = 17 \)

2. **Understand the geometric relationships:**
   - Since \( F H \cong F L \), point \( F \) is equidistant from points \( H \) and \( L \).
   - Given that \( FK = 17 \), we need to find the length of \( JG \).

3. **Analyze the circle and its properties:**
   - \( J \) and \( K \) lie on the circle centered at \( F \).
   - Since \( F \) is the center of the circle, \( FK \) is the radius.
   - Therefore, \( FK = JF = 17 \).

4. **Determine the relationship between \( JG \) and the circle:**
   - \( JG \) appears to be a chord of the circle.
   - To find \( JG \), we need to consider the perpendicular distances and right triangles formed within the circle.

5. **Use the Pythagorean theorem:**
   - Consider the right triangle \( JFG \).
   - Here, \( JF = 17 \) (radius).
   - \( FG \) is the hypotenuse, which we need to find.

Since the problem does not provide any direct measurement for \( FG \), we can infer that \( FG \) would be the diameter of the circle because \( JG \) spans across the circle.

6. **Calculate the diameter:**
   - If \( FG \) is the diameter, then \( FG = 2 \times 17 = 34 \).

However, the problem asks for \( JG \), which seems to be a chord length. Given the symmetry and the equal distances, it is likely that \( JG \) is the same as the length of the chord \( FK \), which is 17.

Final calculation suggests that \( JG = 17 \).

<solution> "Solution section"

Given the symmetry and the properties of the circle, the length of \( JG \) should be the same as the radius of the circle, which is 17.

Therefore, the length of \( JG \) is:
