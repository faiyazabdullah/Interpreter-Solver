Let's analyze the given geometric figure:

1. The segment \( TU \) is tangent to the circle at point \( U \).
2. The radius \( UT \) is perpendicular to the tangent line \( TU \).
3. We know the lengths \( TU = 7 \) and \( TV = 11 \).

We need to find the length of the segment \( TU \), which is labeled as \( x \).

Since \( TU \) is tangent to the circle at \( U \), the right triangle \( TUV \) is formed where \( TU \) is the tangent segment, \( TV \) is the hypotenuse, and \( UT \) is the radius.

Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \( TUV \):
\[ TV^2 = TU^2 + UT^2 \]

Substitute the known values:
\[ 11^2 = x^2 + 7^2 \]
\[ 121 = x^2 + 49 \]
\[ x^2 = 121 - 49 \]
\[ x^2 = 72 \]
\[ x = \sqrt{72} \]
\[ x \approx 8.485 \]

Rounding to the nearest tenth:
\[ x \approx 8.5 \]

Now, let's compare our calculated value with the given answer choices:
A. 7.5
B. 8.5
C. 9.2
D. 13.0

The closest value is B.
