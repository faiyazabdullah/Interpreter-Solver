To find \( m \angle 4 \), let's analyze the given information and geometric properties:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - There is a triangle with vertices labeled as \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
   - An angle at vertex \( A \) is marked as \( 123^\circ \).
   - Side \( AB \) is given as 4 units long.
   - There is a right angle at vertex \( C \).

2. **Understand the relationships:**
   - Since \( \angle C \) is a right angle, it measures \( 90^\circ \).
   - The sum of the angles in a triangle is always \( 180^\circ \).

3. **Calculate the remaining angle:**
   - Let's denote the third angle as \( \angle 4 \).
   - We know that the sum of the angles in the triangle is:
     \[
     \angle A + \angle B + \angle C = 180^\circ
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     123^\circ + \angle 4 + 90^\circ = 180^\circ
     \]

4. **Solve for \( \angle 4 \):**
   - Combine the known angles:
     \[
     213^\circ + \angle 4 = 180^\circ
     \]
   - Subtract \( 213^\circ \) from both sides:
     \[
     \angle 4 = 180^\circ - 213^\circ = -33^\circ
     \]

Since the angle cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation should be that the angle at \( A \) is part of a larger exterior angle. Therefore, the correct approach is to consider the supplementary angle:

5. **Correct approach:**
   - The angle at \( A \) forms a linear pair with its exterior angle, which is supplementary to \( 123^\circ \).
   - Thus, the exterior angle is:
     \[
     180^\circ - 123^\circ = 57^\circ
     \]
   - The interior angle \( \angle 4 \) is then:
     \[
     90^\circ + 57^\circ = 147^\circ
     \]

Given the options, the closest value is \( 57^\circ \).
