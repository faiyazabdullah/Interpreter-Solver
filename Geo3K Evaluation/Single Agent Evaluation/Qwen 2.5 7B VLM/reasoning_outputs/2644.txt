To find BC, let's analyze the given geometric figure:

1. **Identify the shapes and measurements**:
   - There is a quadrilateral ABCD.
   - The diagonals AC and BD intersect at point E.
   - The length of segment BE is given as 5 units.
   - The length of segment EC is given as 12 units.

2. **Understand the relationship**:
   - Since the diagonals AC and BD intersect at point E, they divide each other proportionally. However, the problem does not provide enough information about the lengths of AE and ED directly.
   
3. **Check the answer choices**:
   - The answer choices are A (5), B (9), C (12), and D (13).

Since the lengths of AE and ED are not provided, we need to infer or assume the correct length for BC based on the given lengths BE and EC.

Given that the sum of BE and EC is 17 units (BE + EC = 5 + 12 = 17), we can infer that BC is likely the hypotenuse of a right triangle formed by these segments if we assume the simplest geometric configuration. 

However, without more specific geometric constraints or additional information, we cannot definitively determine BC. But considering the closest logical fit among the given choices, we can make an educated guess.

Let's check the closest value:
- The closest value to 17 that fits the choices is 13.

Thus, based on the given information and the closest logical fit, BC is most likely 13.
