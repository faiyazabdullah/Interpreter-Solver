To solve this problem, let's analyze the given information and apply the Midsegment Theorem for Trapezoids.

1. **Identify Given Information:**
   - Trapezoid \( TRSV \)
   - \( TR = 32 \)
   - \( MN = 25 \)
   - \( M \) and \( N \) are midpoints of legs \( TV \) and \( SV \) respectively.

2. **Understand the Midsegment Theorem:**
   - The Midsegment theorem states that the segment connecting the midpoints of the non-parallel sides of a trapezoid is parallel to the bases and its length is the average of the lengths of the bases.

3. **Apply the Midsegment Theorem:**
   - According to the theorem, \( MN \) (the midsegment) is equal to the average of the lengths of the bases \( TR \) and \( VS \).
   - Therefore, we have:
     \[
     MN = \frac{TR + VS}{2}
     \]

4. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Substitute \( MN = 25 \), \( TR = 32 \), and solve for \( VS \):
     \[
     25 = \frac{32 + VS}{2}
     \]

5. **Solve for \( VS \):**
   - Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     50 = 32 + VS
     \]
   - Subtract 32 from both sides:
     \[
     VS = 50 - 32
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     VS = 18
     \]

6. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - Check if the calculated value matches one of the given answer choices.
   - The calculated value \( VS = 18 \) matches option A.

Final Answer: A
