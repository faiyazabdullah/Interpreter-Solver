First, let's analyze the given geometric figure:

1. **Identify the circle and its properties**: The figure shows a circle with points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\), \(E\), and \(G\) marked on it.
2. **Angles and arcs**: We know that angle \(ACB\) is \(60^\circ\). Since \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) lie on the circle, triangle \(ACB\) is inscribed in the circle.
3. **Central angle and inscribed angle relationship**: The central angle subtended by arc \(AB\) is twice the inscribed angle subtended by the same arc. Thus, the central angle \(AOB\) is \(120^\circ\).
4. **Point \(G\) and perpendicularity**: Point \(G\) lies on the line segment \(BC\) and is perpendicular to \(BC\). This means \(G\) is the midpoint of the arc \(BC\) not containing \(A\) and \(D\).

Now, we need to find the measure of angle \(BGE\):

5. **Identify the straight angle**: Since \(G\) is the midpoint of arc \(BC\) and \(BC\) is a chord, \(BG\) and \(CG\) are equal radii of the circle, making \(BGC\) an isosceles triangle with base \(BC\).
6. **Calculate angle \(BGC\)**: Since \(G\) is the midpoint of arc \(BC\) and the circle's center would bisect the arc, angle \(BGC\) is half of the central angle subtended by arc \(BC\). Therefore, angle \(BGC = 60^\circ\).
7. **Triangle \(BGE\)**: Since \(G\) is the midpoint of arc \(BC\), triangle \(BGE\) forms a right triangle at \(G\) because \(BC\) is a chord and \(G\) is the midpoint, making \(BG\) and \(CG\) perpendicular to \(BC\). Hence, angle \(BGE\) is the complement of angle \(BGC\) in the right triangle \(BGE\).

Therefore, angle \(BGE\) is \(90^\circ\).

</thought>

<solution>
Since angle \(BGC\) is \(60^\circ\) and triangle \(BGE\) is a right triangle at \(G\), angle \(BGE\) must be \(90^\circ\).

However, none of the provided answer choices match \(90^\circ\). Given the problem constraints and the choices provided, the closest option to \(90^\circ\) is:

Final Answer: B
