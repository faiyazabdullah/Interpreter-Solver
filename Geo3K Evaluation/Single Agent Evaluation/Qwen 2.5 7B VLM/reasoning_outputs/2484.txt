First, let's analyze the given geometric figure:

1. The figure consists of a right triangle ABC.
2. Angle ACB is a right angle (indicated by the small square at point C).
3. The length of side AB is given as 42.
4. The length of side BC is given as 38.
5. We need to find the length of side AC, which we will denote as \(x\).

To find \(x\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Here, AB is the hypotenuse.

According to the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ 42^2 = x^2 + 38^2 \]
\[ 1764 = x^2 + 1444 \]
\[ x^2 = 1764 - 1444 \]
\[ x^2 = 320 \]
\[ x = \sqrt{320} \]

Now, let's simplify \(\sqrt{320}\):
\[ \sqrt{320} = \sqrt{64 \times 5} = \sqrt{64} \times \sqrt{5} = 8\sqrt{5} \]

Comparing our result with the given answer choices:
A. \(8\sqrt{2}\)
B. \(8\sqrt{3}\)
C. \(8\sqrt{5}\)
D. \(8\sqrt{7}\)

The closest match is option C.
