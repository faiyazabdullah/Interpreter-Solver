Let's analyze the given geometric figure:

1. The figure is a triangle (ABC).
2. The base of the triangle is labeled as BC, which is 34 inches.
3. There is a perpendicular line segment AD, which represents the height of the triangle from vertex A to side BC.
4. The area of the triangle is given as 357 square inches.
5. We need to find the length of AD, which is represented as 'x' inches.

To find x, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

Given:
\[ \text{Area} = 357 \]
\[ \text{base} = 34 \]

Substitute the values into the formula:
\[ 357 = \frac{1}{2} \times 34 \times x \]

Simplify and solve for x:
\[ 357 = 17 \times x \]
\[ x = \frac{357}{17} \]
\[ x = 21 \]

Now let's compare our calculated value with the given answer choices:
A. 21
B. 22
C. 23
D. 24

The closest value to our calculated result of 21 is option A.
