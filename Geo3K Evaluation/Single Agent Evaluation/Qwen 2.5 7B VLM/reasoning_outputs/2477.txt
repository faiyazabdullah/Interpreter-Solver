Let's analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the given information**:
   - There is a circle with points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) marked on it.
   - An arc \(AC\) is labeled with a measure of \(122^\circ\).
   - We need to find the measure of angle \(B\).

2. **Understand the relationship**:
   - Angle \(B\) is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc \(AC\).
   - According to the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.

3. **Calculate the measure of angle \(B\)**:
   - Given that arc \(AC\) measures \(122^\circ\).
   - Therefore, angle \(B\) (the inscribed angle) will be half of \(122^\circ\):
     \[
     \text{Measure of } \angle B = \frac{122^\circ}{2} = 61^\circ
     \]

4. **Compare with the answer choices**:
   - The calculated measure of angle \(B\) is \(61^\circ\).
   - This value matches option C.

Based on these steps, the correct answer choice is C.
