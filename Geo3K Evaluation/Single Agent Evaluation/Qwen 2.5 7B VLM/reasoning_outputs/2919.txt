Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Given Information:**
   - The rhombus has one diagonal that is twice as long as the other diagonal.
   - The area of the rhombus is 169 square millimeters.

2. **Understand the Geometry:**
   - In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles.
   - Therefore, if we let the shorter diagonal be \( d \), then the longer diagonal will be \( 2d \).

3. **Area Formula for Rhombus:**
   - The area of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{product of diagonals}
     \]
   - Substituting the given values:
     \[
     169 = \frac{1}{2} \times d \times 2d
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   \[
   169 = \frac{1}{2} \times 2d^2
   \]
   \[
   169 = d^2
   \]

5. **Solve for \( d \):**
   \[
   d = \sqrt{169}
   \]
   \[
   d = 13
   \]

6. **Find the Lengths of the Diagonals:**
   - Since the longer diagonal is \( 2d \):
     \[
     \text{Longer diagonal} = 2 \times 13 = 26
     \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The lengths of the diagonals are 13 mm (shorter) and 26 mm (longer).

<solution>
Based on the calculations, the lengths of the diagonals are 13 mm and 26 mm. Comparing these with the given answer choices:

- A: 6.5
- B: 13
- C: 26
- D: 52

The correct answer is B.

Final Answer: B
