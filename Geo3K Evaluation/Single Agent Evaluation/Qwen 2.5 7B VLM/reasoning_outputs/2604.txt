To find the value of \( x \), we need to analyze the given geometric figure. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Identify the shapes and relationships**: The figure shows a triangle with one side labeled as \( x \) and another side labeled as \( x - 3 \). There's also a segment labeled as 9 that seems to connect the vertices of the triangle in a specific manner.

2. **Understand the given information**:
   - One side of the triangle is \( x \).
   - Another side of the triangle is \( x - 3 \).
   - A segment inside the triangle is labeled as 9.

3. **Analyze the triangle**:
   - Since the sides of the triangle are given as \( x \) and \( x - 3 \), it suggests a possible right triangle configuration involving these lengths.
   - The segment 9 appears to form part of a right angle configuration with the sides \( x \) and \( x - 3 \).

4. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem**:
   - For a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem states \( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \), where \( c \) is the hypotenuse and \( a \) and \( b \) are the other two sides.
   - Here, let's assume \( x \) and \( x - 3 \) are the legs of the right triangle, and the hypotenuse is 9.

5. **Set up the equation**:
   \[
   9^2 = x^2 + (x - 3)^2
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   81 = x^2 + (x - 3)^2
   \]
   Expanding:
   \[
   81 = x^2 + x^2 - 6x + 9
   \]
   Combining like terms:
   \[
   81 = 2x^2 - 6x + 9
   \]
   Rearrange to form a quadratic equation:
   \[
   2x^2 - 6x + 9 - 81 = 0
   \]
   \[
   2x^2 - 6x - 72 = 0
   \]

6. **Solve the quadratic equation**:
   - Use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 2 \), \( b = -6 \), and \( c = -72 \).
   - Calculate the discriminant:
     \[
     b^2 - 4ac = (-6)^2 - 4(2)(-72) = 36 + 576 = 612
     \]
   - The square root of 612 is approximately 24.74.
   - Substitute back into the quadratic formula:
     \[
     x = \frac{-(-6) \pm \sqrt{612}}{2(2)} = \frac{6 \pm 24.74}{4}
     \]
   - Calculate the two solutions:
     \[
     x = \frac{6 + 24.74}{4} = \frac{30.74}{4} = 7.685
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{6 - 24.74}{4} = \frac{-18.74}{4} = -4.685
     \]

7. **Select the appropriate value**:
   - Since \( x \) represents a length, it must be positive.
   - The value \( x = 7.685 \) is closest to the answer choices given.

Given the answer choices:
A. 12
B. 15
C. 18
D. 21

The closest value is 15.
