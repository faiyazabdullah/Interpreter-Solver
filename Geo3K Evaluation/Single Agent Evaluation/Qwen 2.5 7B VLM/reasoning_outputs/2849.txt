To solve for \( y \), we need to use the fact that the sum of angles around point \( E \) is \( 360^\circ \). Angles \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 5 \) are adjacent and together form a straight line with the angle at point \( E \).

First, let's find the measure of angle \( \angle 4 \) and angle \( \angle 5 \):

Given:
\[ m \angle 4 = 2y + 32 \]
\[ m \angle 5 = 3y - 3 \]

Since angles \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 5 \) are adjacent and form a straight line with the angle at point \( E \), their sum should be \( 180^\circ \):
\[ m \angle 4 + m \angle 5 = 180^\circ \]

Substitute the given expressions for \( m \angle 4 \) and \( m \angle 5 \):
\[ (2y + 32) + (3y - 3) = 180 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 2y + 3y + 32 - 3 = 180 \]
\[ 5y + 29 = 180 \]

Isolate \( y \):
\[ 5y = 180 - 29 \]
\[ 5y = 151 \]
\[ y = \frac{151}{5} \]
\[ y = 30.2 \]

Now, compare the calculated value of \( y \) with the given answer choices:
A. 18
B. 35
C. 55
D. 72

The closest value to 30.2 among the choices is 35.

Final Answer: B</think>

<Solution>
To solve for \( y \), we use the fact that the sum of angles around point \( E \) is \( 360^\circ \). However, since angles \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 5 \) form a straight line with the angle at point \( E \), their sum should be \( 180^\circ \).

Given:
\[ m \angle 4 = 2y + 32 \]
\[ m \angle 5 = 3y - 3 \]

Sum of angles:
\[ (2y + 32) + (3y - 3) = 180 \]
\[ 5y + 29 = 180 \]
\[ 5y = 151 \]
\[ y = \frac{151}{5} \]
\[ y = 30.2 \]

The closest value to 30.2 among the choices is 35.
