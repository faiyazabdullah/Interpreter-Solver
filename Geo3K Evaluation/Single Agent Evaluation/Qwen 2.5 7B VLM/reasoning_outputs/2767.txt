Let's analyze the geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the given information**:
   - There is a circle with points A, B, C, D, and E.
   - Angle ABC is marked as 65°.
   - Angle ADE is marked as 132°.

2. **Understand the relationships**:
   - Since ABC and ADE are inscribed angles, they intercept arcs AC and AD respectively.
   - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts.

3. **Calculate the arc lengths**:
   - For angle ABC (65°), the intercepted arc is AC.
   - For angle ADE (132°), the intercepted arc is AD.
   - The sum of these arcs plus the arc CD should cover the full circle.

4. **Sum the arcs**:
   - Arc AC + Arc AD + Arc CD = 360° (full circle).
   - Given Arc AC = 2 * 65° = 130°.
   - Given Arc AD = 2 * 132° = 264°.
   - Therefore, Arc CD = 360° - 130° - 264° = 6°.

5. **Find the measure of angle BEC**:
   - Angle BEC is the central angle subtended by arc BC.
   - The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc.
   - Arc BC = Arc AC - Arc CD = 130° - 6° = 124°.
   - Therefore, angle BEC = 124°.

6. **Identify the remaining angle**:
   - We need to find the measure of angle BEC which is marked as x.
   - From the given options, we can see that x = 124° fits perfectly within the range of possible answers.

Given the analysis, the correct value for x is 124°, which matches option C.
