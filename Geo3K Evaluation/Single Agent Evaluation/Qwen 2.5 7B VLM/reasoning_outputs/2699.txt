To solve this problem, let's analyze the given information and the geometric relationships in the figure:

1. **Given Information:**
   - \( AB = 30 \)
   - \( CD = 30 \)
   - \( m\widehat{CZ} = 40^\circ \)

2. **Identifying Key Elements:**
   - \( \odot X \) is a circle with center \( X \).
   - \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \) are points on the circumference of the circle.
   - \( N \) is the midpoint of arc \( CD \).

3. **Analyzing the Arcs and Angles:**
   - Since \( CD = 30 \) and \( AB = 30 \), both arcs \( CD \) and \( AB \) have the same length.
   - The angle subtended by arc \( CD \) at the center \( X \) is given as \( m\widehat{CZ} = 40^\circ \).

4. **Finding the Relationship Between Arcs:**
   - The total measure of the circle is \( 360^\circ \).
   - If \( m\widehat{CZ} = 40^\circ \), then the remaining arc \( CZ \) also measures \( 40^\circ \) because the circle is symmetric.

5. **Calculating the Remaining Arc \( CD \):**
   - Since the total arc around the circle is \( 360^\circ \), the remaining arc \( CD \) would be \( 360^\circ - 40^\circ = 320^\circ \).

6. **Finding the Length of \( ND \):**
   - Since \( N \) is the midpoint of arc \( CD \), it divides the arc into two equal parts.
   - Therefore, each part of arc \( CD \) would be \( \frac{320^\circ}{2} = 160^\circ \).

However, we need to find the length of \( ND \). Given that \( N \) is the midpoint of arc \( CD \), and considering the symmetry and equal lengths of arcs, the length of chord \( ND \) would be half of the diameter of the circle. But since the exact length of the chord cannot be derived directly from the given data without additional information about the radius, we need to consider the proportional relationship of the arcs and chords.

Since the problem simplifies the scenario and the only given lengths are equal (30 for both arcs), the length of \( ND \) can be inferred as a proportional segment of the circle's radius-based properties.

Given the symmetry and the equal lengths, the length of \( ND \) should be half of the given arc lengths' proportionally equivalent length.

Thus, the closest value among the given options that fits the proportional symmetry is:
