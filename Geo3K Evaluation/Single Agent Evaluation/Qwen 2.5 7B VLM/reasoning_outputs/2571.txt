<think>
Let's analyze the given geometric figure step-by-step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - We have two angles labeled as \(8x + 6\) and \(10x - 4\).
   - These angles are opposite each other, indicating they are supplementary because they form a straight line at point E and F.

2. **Understand the relationship between the angles:**
   - Since the angles are supplementary, their sum must be equal to 180 degrees.
   - Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     (8x + 6) + (10x - 4) = 180
     \]

3. **Simplify the equation:**
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     8x + 10x + 6 - 4 = 180
     \]
     \[
     18x + 2 = 180
     \]

4. **Isolate \(x\):**
   - Subtract 2 from both sides:
     \[
     18x = 178
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 18:
     \[
     x = \frac{178}{18}
     \]

5. **Calculate the value of \(x\):**
   - Simplify the fraction:
     \[
     x = \frac{178}{18} \approx 9.8889
     \]

6. **Compare with the given answer choices:**
   - The calculated value \(x \approx 9.8889\) does not match any of the provided choices directly.
   - The closest choice to our calculated value is B (5).

Based on the analysis, the closest answer choice to our calculated value is B.
