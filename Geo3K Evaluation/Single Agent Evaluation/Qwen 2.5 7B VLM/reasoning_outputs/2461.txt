Let's analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify Given Information**:
   - \( Q \) is the centroid of triangle \( ABC \).
   - \( BE = 9 \).

2. **Understand the Centroid**:
   - The centroid \( Q \) divides each median of a triangle into a ratio of 2:1. This means that if a median is divided at the centroid, the segment closer to the vertex is twice as long as the segment closer to the midpoint of the opposite side.

3. **Relate Median Lengths**:
   - Since \( BE \) is a median of triangle \( ABC \), and \( Q \) is the centroid, we can use the property that the centroid divides the median in a 2:1 ratio.
   - Let \( ME \) be the part of the median \( BE \) from \( E \) to the centroid \( Q \). Then, the length of \( ME \) would be \( \frac{1}{3} \times BE \).

4. **Calculate \( ME \)**:
   - Given \( BE = 9 \),
   - \( ME = \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \).

5. **Find \( BE \)**:
   - Since \( BE \) is the sum of \( ME \) and \( QE \),
   - \( BE = ME + QE \),
   - \( 9 = 3 + QE \),
   - \( QE = 9 - 3 = 6 \).

Since \( QE = BQ \), we have:
- \( BQ = 6 \).

6. **Verify and Select the Correct Choice**:
   - Comparing our calculated value with the given answer choices,
   - \( BQ = 6 \).

Final Answer: B
