Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the given information**: The problem states that the ratio of the measures of the angles of the triangle is 3 : 2 : 1.

2. **Summarize the relevant geometric property**: The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees.

3. **Set up the equation based on the ratio**:
   Let the measures of the angles be \(3x\), \(2x\), and \(1x\).
   Therefore, the sum of these angles is \(3x + 2x + 1x = 6x\).

4. **Apply the sum of angles property**:
   \[
   6x = 180^\circ
   \]

5. **Solve for \(x\)**:
   \[
   x = \frac{180^\circ}{6} = 30^\circ
   \]

6. **Calculate the actual angle measures**:
   - Angle 1: \(3x = 3 \times 30^\circ = 90^\circ\)
   - Angle 2: \(2x = 2 \times 30^\circ = 60^\circ\)
   - Angle 3: \(1x = 1 \times 30^\circ = 30^\circ\)

7. **Identify which angle measure is not included in the calculated angles**:
   The calculated angles are 90°, 60°, and 30°. None of the provided answer choices (30, 45, 60, 90) are missing from our calculated set.

Since the problem asks which angle measure is *not* an angle measure of the triangle, we need to check each option against our calculated results.

- Option A: 30° (This matches our calculated 30°)
- Option B: 45° (Not in our calculated set)
- Option C: 60° (This matches our calculated 60°)
- Option D: 90° (This matches our calculated 90°)

Therefore, the correct answer is B.

Final Answer: B
