To solve this problem, we need to find the measure of angle 10, given that its measure is expressed as \(2x + 4\) and another angle, angle 9, is expressed as \(2x - 4\).

First, let's analyze the geometric figure:

1. Angles 9 and 10 appear to be adjacent angles forming a straight line with another angle (angle BCD) that seems to be a right angle (90 degrees).
2. Since angles 9 and 10 form a straight line with a right angle, they should sum up to 180 degrees minus the right angle.

Therefore, we can set up the equation for the sum of these angles:
\[ m\angle 9 + m\angle 10 = 180^\circ \]

Substituting the given expressions for the angles:
\[ (2x - 4) + (2x + 4) = 180^\circ \]

Now, let's solve for \(x\):
\[ 2x - 4 + 2x + 4 = 180 \]
\[ 4x = 180 \]
\[ x = 45 \]

Next, substitute \(x = 45\) back into the expression for \(m\angle 10\):
\[ m\angle 10 = 2x + 4 \]
\[ m\angle 10 = 2(45) + 4 \]
\[ m\angle 10 = 90 + 4 \]
\[ m\angle 10 = 94 \]

Finally, compare our calculated result with the given answer choices:
A. 86
B. 94
C. 98
D. 104

The closest match to our calculated value of 94 is option B.
