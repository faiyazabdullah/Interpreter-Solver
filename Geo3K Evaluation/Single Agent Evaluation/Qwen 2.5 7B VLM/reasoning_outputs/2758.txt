<thought>
To find the height of trapezoid G H J K, we need to use the formula for the area of a trapezoid:

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{(b_1 + b_2) \times h}{2} \]

Where:
- \( b_1 \) is the length of the first base (GH).
- \( b_2 \) is the length of the second base (JK).
- \( h \) is the height of the trapezoid.

Given:
- Area = 75 square meters
- Length of GH = 17 meters
- Length of JK = 13 meters

Substitute the known values into the formula:

\[ 75 = \frac{(17 + 13) \times h}{2} \]

Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[ 75 = \frac{30 \times h}{2} \]

Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:

\[ 150 = 30h \]

Divide both sides by 30 to solve for \( h \):

\[ h = \frac{150}{30} \]
\[ h = 5 \]

Thus, the height of the trapezoid is 5 meters.

The height of the trapezoid is 5 meters.
