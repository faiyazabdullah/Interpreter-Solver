Let's analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

1. **Identify the given information**:
   - Angle LPM = 25°.
   - Angle MPN = 25°.
   - The line segment PM is bisected by the perpendiculars drawn from points L and N to PA and PB respectively.
   - The lengths of segments are labeled as \(3x + 6\) for PL and \(4x - 2\) for PN.

2. **Understand the relationships**:
   - Since the perpendiculars from L and N to PA and PB respectively bisect the angles at P, triangle PLM and triangle PNM are congruent by the Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) criterion.
   - Therefore, the lengths of PL and PN must be equal because they are corresponding sides of congruent triangles.

3. **Set up the equation**:
   \[
   PL = PN
   \]
   Given the lengths:
   \[
   PL = 3x + 6
   \]
   \[
   PN = 4x - 2
   \]
   Since PL = PN, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   3x + 6 = 4x - 2
   \]

4. **Solve for x**:
   \[
   3x + 6 = 4x - 2
   \]
   Subtract 3x from both sides:
   \[
   6 = x - 2
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   8 = x
   \]

5. **Find the value of PN**:
   Substitute \(x = 8\) into the expression for PN:
   \[
   PN = 4x - 2 = 4(8) - 2 = 32 - 2 = 30
   \]

6. **Verify the answer**:
   The calculated length of PN is 30, which matches option B.

Final Answer: B
