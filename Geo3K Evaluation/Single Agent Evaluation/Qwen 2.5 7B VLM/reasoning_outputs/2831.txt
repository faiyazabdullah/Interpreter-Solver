To solve for \( x \), we need to use the properties of tangents and the fact that they are equal in length when drawn from a point outside a circle. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Identify the Tangent Segments**: The segments \( BE \) and \( CE \) are tangent to the circle at points \( E \) and \( F \), respectively. According to the tangent-tangent theorem, these segments are equal in length.

2. **Calculate the Length of the Tangents**:
   - Given \( BE = 15 \)
   - Given \( CE = 12 \)

3. **Use the Power of a Point Theorem**: The Power of a Point theorem states that for a point outside a circle, the product of the lengths of the two segments of one secant line equals the product of the lengths of the two tangent segments from the same point. However, in this case, since both segments are tangents, we can directly compare the lengths.

4. **Set Up the Equation**: Since \( BE = 15 \) and \( CE = 12 \), and considering the tangents from the same external point, the ratio of the segments should be consistent with the given lengths.

5. **Solve for \( x \)**: We need to find the length of \( AD \), which is the segment formed by extending \( BE \) and \( CE \). Since the problem does not involve a direct calculation of \( x \) but rather the relationship between the segments, we can infer that \( x \) is the length of the segment \( AD \).

Given the lengths of the tangents:
\[ BE = 15 \]
\[ CE = 12 \]

Since the segments are tangent to the circle from the same external point, the length of \( AD \) is simply the sum of the lengths of the tangents minus the overlapping part (which is not given but assumed to be zero in this context):
\[ AD = BE + CE = 15 + 12 = 27 \]

However, the problem seems to be asking for a different interpretation or a different application of the tangents' properties. Let's assume the correct interpretation is to find the length of the segment \( AD \) which is the sum of the tangents minus the overlap, which in this case is not applicable as the tangents do not overlap.

Given the choices:
A. 7.2
B. 8
C. 12
D. 15

Since the calculated length \( AD = 27 \) does not match any of the given choices, we need to consider the closest value.
