<think>
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - There is a triangle \( \triangle DEF \).
   - \(\angle E = 25^\circ\).
   - \(\angle F = 65^\circ\).

2. **Sum of angles in a triangle:**
   The sum of the interior angles in any triangle is always \(180^\circ\). Therefore, we can find the measure of \(\angle D\) as follows:
   \[
   \angle D = 180^\circ - \angle E - \angle F
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   \angle D = 180^\circ - 25^\circ - 65^\circ = 90^\circ
   \]

3. **Identify the relationship between \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle D\):**
   Since \(\angle D\) is \(90^\circ\) and it is the vertex angle of the triangle \( \triangle DEF \), and considering that \(D\) is the vertex opposite the right angle in the triangle \( \triangle DGF \) (which is implied by the right angle at \(G\)), we need to determine \(\angle 1\).

4. **Sum of angles around point \(D\):**
   The angles around point \(D\) form a straight line. Therefore:
   \[
   \angle 1 + \angle 2 + \angle D = 180^\circ
   \]
   Since \(\angle D = 90^\circ\):
   \[
   \angle 1 + \angle 2 + 90^\circ = 180^\circ
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \angle 1 + \angle 2 = 90^\circ
   \]

5. **Determine \(\angle 1\):**
   Given that \(\angle 2\) is the angle adjacent to \(\angle 1\) and forms part of the right angle at \(D\), \(\angle 2\) must be \(90^\circ - \angle 1\).

Since \(\angle 2\) is part of the right angle and \(\angle 1\) is the remaining angle, and knowing that \(\angle 1\) must be less than \(90^\circ\), we conclude:
\[
\angle 1 = 65^\circ
\]

</think>

**Solution:**

Based on the analysis, the measure of \(\angle 1\) is \(65^\circ\).
