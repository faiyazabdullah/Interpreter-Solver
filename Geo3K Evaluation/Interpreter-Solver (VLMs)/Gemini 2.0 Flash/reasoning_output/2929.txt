From PointLiesOnLine(X,Line(D,C)) + PointLiesOnLine(Z,Line(D,C)) → X, Z lie on Line DC, so angles ∠WXZ and ∠IZC are supplementary to ∠YXJ and ∠YZI, respectively.
From MeasureOf(Angle(W,X,J)) = 130 → m∠YXJ = 180 - 130 = 50 degrees.
From MeasureOf(Angle(I,Z,C)) = 20 → m∠YZI = 180 - 20 = 160 degrees.
In Triangle(I,J,H) we are given that IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. It is also given that the segments XJ and YJ intersect the segment IJ at I and the segment HJ at H respectively. The length ratio given does not provide any useful information.
Consider the angles in triangle JXY: m∠JXY + m∠XYJ + m∠YJX = 180. We know m∠JXY = 50.

Consider the angles in triangle JYZ: m∠JZY + m∠YZJ + m∠ZJY = 180. We know m∠YZJ = 160. Therefore m∠JZY + m∠ZJY = 180 - 160 = 20.
The question seems to be asking for angle J in triangle HIJ. We are given that Line GI intersects Line DC, and Line XJ intersects Line GI. We also have angles m∠WXJ = 130 and m∠IZC = 20. Therefore, the angle supplementary to 130 is 50, and the angle supplementary to 20 is 160. Therefore ∠JXI is 50 and ∠JZI is 160.
∠HXI + ∠HXW = 180 and ∠YZI + ∠JZC = 180
∠WXJ + ∠HXJ = 180 so ∠HXJ = 180 - 130 = 50
∠IZC = 20 so ∠IZY + ∠IZC = 180 and ∠IZY = 160

Let ∠J be the angle in triangle JIH. We have no additional information. Let's consider some special cases to see if we get a unique solution. If the lines GI and DC are parallel, then we cannot form a triangle JIH.
It appears that there isn't enough information to solve the problem.

Given: IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ, m∠WXJ = 130, m∠IZC = 20. Find m∠J.
From m∠WXJ = 130, we have m∠YXJ = 180 - 130 = 50.
From m∠IZC = 20, we have m∠YZI = 180 - 20 = 160.
In triangle JIY, m∠JIY + m∠IJY + m∠YJI = 180.
m∠IJY = 50
m∠IYJ + m∠YZI = 180. so m∠IYJ = 180-160=20
50+20 + angle J = 180
angle J = 110.
I have found where the error is:  The question gives that  \frac { I J } { X J } = \frac { H J } { Y J }  but this means that triangles HIJ and YXJ are similar if angle JHI is the same as JYX.  Since triangles are not similar the equation given is not useful.
However, triangle XYZ can be said to have: m∠YXZ = 50
From these values, the angle XYZ doesn't make a lot of sense.
Because triangle HJI and XYJ are not necessarily similar, and there are no additional predicates, there's not enough information to determine J.
But because the ratio is related it is similar to YXZ?

I am unable to find angle J.
