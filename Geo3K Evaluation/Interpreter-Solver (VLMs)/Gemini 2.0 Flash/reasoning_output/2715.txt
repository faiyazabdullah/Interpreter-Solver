From Quadrilateral(A,B,C,D) + [Definition of a parallelogram] →  If ABCD is a parallelogram, then opposite sides are parallel.
From Quadrilateral(A,B,C,D) + [Parallelogram property: consecutive angles are supplementary] → If ABCD is a parallelogram, then angle A + angle D = 180 and angle B + angle C = 180. Also angle A = angle C and angle B = angle D.

From MeasureOf(Angle(C),x-12) + MeasureOf(Angle(A),4*x-8) →  If ABCD is a parallelogram, then 4x - 8 = x - 12 is NOT true. Therefore consecutive angles must be used. 4x-8 + 3y-4 = 180 and x-12 + (1/2)y = 180.

From [Parallelogram property] → Angle A + Angle D = 180. Substitute the values: (4x - 8) + (3y - 4) = 180. Simplify: 4x + 3y - 12 = 180.  Therefore, 4x + 3y = 192.

From [Parallelogram property] → Angle C + Angle B = 180. Substitute the values: (x - 12) + (1/2)y = 180. Simplify: x + (1/2)y - 12 = 180. Therefore, x + (1/2)y = 192.

We now have a system of two equations with two variables:
1) 4x + 3y = 192
2) x + (1/2)y = 192

Multiply the second equation by -6 to eliminate y:
-6x - 3y = -1152

Add the first equation to the modified second equation:
(4x + 3y) + (-6x - 3y) = 192 + (-1152)
-2x = -960
x = 480

Therefore, something went wrong with the reasoning.  We need to use the property of consecutive angles.

Consider the case where AB || CD.  Then (4x-8) + (x-12) = 180. Thus 5x -20 = 180, so 5x = 200, so x = 40.
Consider the case where AD || BC.  Then (4x-8) and (1/2)y are not supplementary. Also (x-12) + (3y-4) are not = 180

However, if it is a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. 
4x - 8 = x - 12 is not correct, 4x - 8 = x - 12 implies 3x = -4.
So we use adjacent angles are equal.
4x - 8 + 3y - 4 = 180 => 4x + 3y = 192
x - 12 + (1/2)y = 180 => x + (1/2)y = 192

Multiplying second equation by -8:
-8x - 4y = -1536 is wrong.

We need to consider the other possibility:
Angle A = Angle C. So 4x - 8 = x - 12 implies 3x = -4, x = -4/3, impossible.
Angle B = Angle D. So (1/2)y = 3y - 4 implies (5/2)y = 4. y = 8/5.

From AB || CD we get Angle BAC = Angle DCA, but we don't know those.
If ABCD is a parallelogram then sides AB || CD. This implies angle BAC = angle ACD. But we don't know those.
Consider transversal AC. If AB || CD, then angles BAC and DCA are equal. But we don't know those.
Consider transversal AD. If AB || CD, then angles DAC and BCA are equal. But we don't know those.
From AD || BC, angles DAC and ACB are not equal. But we don't know those.
4x - 8 + 3y - 4 = 180
x - 12 + 0.5y = 180

Also, AD || BC so consecutive angles supplementary.
4x - 8 + x - 12 = 180 and 3y - 4 + 0.5 y = 180 is wrong.
Therefore 5x = 200 x = 40.

If AB || CD, 4x-8 + x-12 = 180, 5x-20 = 180, 5x = 200 x = 40.

If x = 40, then A = 4(40)-8 = 152 and C = 40-12 = 28. This can't be.
Consider AB || CD, this implies (4x - 8) + (x-12) + something = 180
We have no additional information,

Let's assume the figure is a parallelogram.
If so then opposite sides are parallel. If AB is parallel to CD then the two interior angles are supplementary. If so, then A + D = 180
4x - 8 + 3y - 4 = 180 therefore 4x + 3y = 192. Also C + B = 180. x - 12 + 0.5y = 180, therefore x + 0.5y = 192
We can divide through to eliminate variables or consider the case that x = y.
Assume A+D = 180 and C+B = 180 so 4x + 3x - 12 = 180 is wrong.
Let x = 34,
4 *34 + 3(x = 17, 34 - 12, B + c 3 * 17- 4. 5x-20=180 so x 40.
