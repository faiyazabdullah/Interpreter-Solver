From Equals(LengthOf(B,C),LengthOf(C,D)) + LengthOf(B,C,?) + LengthOf(C,D,?) → BC = CD
From Right(Triangle(D,E,C)) + LengthOf(D,E,5) + MeasureOf(Angle(D,E,C),90) → Triangle DEC is a right triangle
From Right(Triangle(B,E,C)) + LengthOf(B,E,12) + MeasureOf(Angle(B,E,C),90) → Triangle BEC is a right triangle
From Equals(LengthOf(B,C),LengthOf(C,D)) → BC = CD
From Right(Triangle(B,E,C)) + LengthOf(B,E,12) → BC^2 = BE^2 + EC^2
From Right(Triangle(D,E,C)) + LengthOf(D,E,5) → CD^2 = DE^2 + EC^2
From BC = CD → BC^2 = CD^2
From BC^2 = BE^2 + EC^2 + CD^2 = DE^2 + EC^2 → BE^2 + EC^2 = DE^2 + EC^2
From BE^2 + EC^2 = DE^2 + EC^2 → BE^2 = DE^2
From BE^2 = DE^2 → BE = DE
The problem states LengthOf(D,E,5) and LengthOf(B,E,12). Thus, BE = 12 and DE = 5.
However, in the question the answer choices are A. 5 B. 9 C. 12 D. 13
Something is wrong here. BC^2 = 12^2 + 5^2 = 144 + 25 = 169, BC = sqrt(169) = 13.
The problem says length of BC is equal to length of CD. Also, we are given DE is 5, BE is 12. We are asked to find BC. Since triangle BEC is a right triangle we have BC^2 = BE^2 + EC^2. And since triangle DEC is a right triangle, we have CD^2 = DE^2 + EC^2. Since BC=CD, BE^2 + EC^2 = DE^2 + EC^2 which implies BE^2 = DE^2, BE = DE. But we are given BE=12 and DE=5 which is a contradiction. We must have messed up.
It is more likely that this is a kite and not necessarily that BC=CD. If BC and CD are not equal, then we must use BC^2 = BE^2 + EC^2. With BE=12, we have BC^2 = 144 + EC^2 and CD^2 = 25 + EC^2. We are stuck.

I made an error in the previous step of assuming EC and CD are equal.
BC^2 = BE^2 + EC^2
BC^2 = 12^2 + EC^2
CD^2 = DE^2 + EC^2
CD^2 = 5^2 + EC^2
Since BC = CD, then
144 + EC^2 = 25 + EC^2.
144 = 25 which is impossible.
The figure is likely wrong since triangles BEC and DEC must be congruent.
So BC = CD gives us right triangle BEC is a right triangle with legs BE=12 and EC and hypotenuse BC.
Right triangle DEC is a right triangle with legs DE=5 and EC and hypotenuse CD. Since BC = CD,
then BC^2 = BE^2 + EC^2 = CD^2 = DE^2 + EC^2. This means BC=CD. So we have 12^2 + EC^2 = 5^2 + EC^2.
144 + EC^2 = 25 + EC^2 is impossible.

Assume BE is 12 and EC = 5. Then BC = sqrt(144+25) = sqrt(169) = 13.
Since BC=CD, then CD=13, which implies
13^2 = 25 + EC^2. So we have 169 = 25 + EC^2. Then EC = sqrt(144) = 12.
Since BC=CD, then BC = 13.
