From BisectsAngle(Line(B,F),Angle(A,B,C)) + Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,F)),MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,F))) → MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,F)) = MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,F)) = 45 degrees
From RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)) → MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)) = 90 degrees
From MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,F)) = MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,F)) = 45 degrees → MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)) = MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,F)) + MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,F))
From MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)) = 90 degrees + MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,F)) = MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,F)) → MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)) = 45 + 45 = 90 degrees
From Parallel(Line(A,C),Line(E,D)) → Angle(A,C,B) = Angle(E,D,C)
From Similar(Triangle(A,B,C),Triangle(E,B,D)) → Angle(B,A,C) = Angle(B,E,D)
Triangle ABC is similar to Triangle EBD, given AC || ED.
Because BF bisects angle ABC, angle ABF = angle CBF = 45 degrees.
Consider triangle ABF. We want to find CF.
Since AC || ED, triangles ABC and EDC are similar.
We are given BA=6, BC=7.5, AC=9, DE=9.
In triangle ABC, since angle ABC is 90 degrees, triangle ABC is a right triangle.
Let CF = x. Then BF = 7.5 - x.
In triangle ABF, angle ABF = 45 degrees.
Since triangle ABF is not necessarily a right triangle, we cannot directly apply trigonometric ratios.
However, we can observe that since Angle CBF = 45 degrees, and line AB intersects line BC forming a right angle, the other angle would be 45 degrees as well. This means that Angle BFA is not 45 degrees.
We can use the angle bisector theorem which states that in triangle ABF, BF/AB = CF/AC.
Applying the angle bisector theorem, we can use the ratio between the sides.
Let's consider triangle ABC.
Then AB/BE = BC/BD = AC/DE = 6/BE = 7.5/BD = 9/9 = 1.
Then BE = 6 and BD = 7.5.
In triangle BDE, Angle DBE = 90 degrees.
DE = 9. Therefore, triangle BDE is congruent to triangle ABC.
Then CD = BD - BC = 7.5 - 7.5 = 0, which is incorrect.
Since AC || ED, triangle ABC ~ triangle EDC. Then BC/CD = AC/ED.
BC = 7.5, AC = 9, ED = 9.
7.  5/CD = 9/9 = 1
CD = 7.5.
Then BD = BC + CD = 7.5 + 7.5 = 15.
But BD = 7.5, which means that triangles ABC and EBD are not similar with vertex B.
Since angle CBF = 45.
Using the law of sines on triangle ABF, AB/sin(BFA) = BF/sin(BAC) = AF/sin(ABF).
From angle BAC + angle ACB = 90 degrees.
Let's look at Triangle BCF.
Applying the sine rule: CF/sin(CBF) = BF/sin(BCF)
CF = x, BF = 7.5 - x. sin(CBF) = sin(45) = sqrt(2)/2
AC || ED. Also BF bisects ABC.
The only case where this makes sense is when angle ABC = 90, therefore we must have triangle ABC similar to triangle EDB.
In triangle ABC, AB=6, BC=7.5. AC=9
Let BC = a, AB=b, AC=c. a = 7.5. b=6. c = 9
AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2
6^2 + 7.5^2 = 36 + 56.25 = 92.25, 9^2 = 81. This is not a right triangle!

We use the length of the angle bisector formula. But we are looking for CF.
From angle bisector theorem, CF/AF = BC/AB = 7.5/6 = 1.25
AF = CF/1.25 = 0.8 CF. CF = x, AF = 0.8x.
The only logical way to proceed is to determine that triangle ABF and BCF are not useful.
However, triangles ABC and EBD must be similar if AC || ED.
