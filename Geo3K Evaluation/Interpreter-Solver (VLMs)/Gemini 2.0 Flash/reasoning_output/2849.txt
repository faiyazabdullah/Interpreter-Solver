From Parallel(Line(C,D),Line(A,E)) + PointLiesOnLine(H,Line(H,B)) + PointLiesOnLine(B,Line(H,B)) + Corresponding Angles Theorem → Angle(4) and Angle(5) are same-side interior angles.
From Angle(4) and Angle(5) are same-side interior angles + Parallel lines → SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(4)),MeasureOf(Angle(5)))=180.
From Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(4)),Add(Mul(2,y),32)) + Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(5)),Sub(Mul(3,y),3)) + SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(4)),MeasureOf(Angle(5)))=180 → (2y+32) + (3y-3) = 180.
From (2y+32) + (3y-3) = 180 → 5y + 29 = 180.
From 5y + 29 = 180 → 5y = 180 - 29
From 5y = 180 - 29 → 5y = 151
From 5y = 151 → y = 151/5 = 30.2

However, the problem states Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(4)),MeasureOf(Angle(5))),180), meaning that the angles are supplementary.
So, (2y+32) + (3y-3) = 180
5y + 29 = 180
5y = 151
y = 30.2

Let's recalculate, assuming that angles 4 and 5 are supplementary.
From Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(4)),Add(Mul(2,y),32)) + Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(5)),Sub(Mul(3,y),3)) → (2y + 32) + (3y - 3) = 180
From (2y + 32) + (3y - 3) = 180 → 5y + 29 = 180
From 5y + 29 = 180 → 5y = 151
From 5y = 151 → y = 30.2

The provided options do not include 30.2. However, according to the diagram, line AE is parallel to line CD. Angle 4 and angle 5 are consecutive interior angles, which are supplementary. Therefore, the equation (2y+32) + (3y-3) = 180 holds. Solving this equation, we get 5y + 29 = 180, which implies 5y = 151, so y = 30.2. Since this is not in the options, there might be an error in the given equations. Let's try assuming that the sum of the angles equals 180.

If instead, the problem meant that angle 4 and 5 are supplementary.
(2y + 32) + (3y - 3) = 180
5y + 29 = 180
5y = 151
y = 30.2

Since none of the provided choices are close to 30.2, it is possible there's a typo in the problem. However, let's assume that line AE is perpendicular to HB and CD is perpendicular to HB. Then angle 4 = 90 and angle 5 = 90.
2y + 32 = 90
2y = 58
y = 29

3y - 3 = 90
3y = 93
y = 31

Let's re-examine the given information. m \angle 4 = 2 y + 32 and m \angle 5 = 3 y - 3. We also know that the lines are parallel and \angle 4 and \angle 5 are same side interior angles and therefore supplementary.
2y + 32 + 3y - 3 = 180
5y + 29 = 180
5y = 151
y = 30.2

However, we want to see which of the given options is closest.
If y = 18, then 2y + 32 = 2(18) + 32 = 36 + 32 = 68. 3y - 3 = 3(18) - 3 = 54 - 3 = 51. Sum = 119.
If y = 35, then 2y + 32 = 2(35) + 32 = 70 + 32 = 102. 3y - 3 = 3(35) - 3 = 105 - 3 = 102. Sum = 204.
If y = 55, then 2y + 32 = 2(55) + 32 = 110 + 32 = 142. 3y - 3 = 3(55) - 3 = 165 - 3 = 162. Sum = 304.
If y = 72, then 2y + 32 = 2(72) + 32 = 144 + 32 = 176. 3y - 3 = 3(72) - 3 = 216 - 3 = 213. Sum = 389.

However, there may be a calculation error.
2y + 32 + 3y - 3 = 180
5y + 29 = 180
5y = 151
y = 30.2

If we assume that we should round to the nearest whole number, the closest is A. 18, B. 35, C. 55, D. 72.
