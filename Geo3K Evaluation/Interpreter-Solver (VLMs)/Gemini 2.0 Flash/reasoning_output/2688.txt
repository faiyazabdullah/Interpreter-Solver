From IsMidpointOf(B,Line(W,Y)) + LengthOf(Line(W,B),8) + LengthOf(Line(B,Y),6) → LengthOf(Line(W,B)) = 8 and LengthOf(Line(B,Y)) = 6, so 8 = 6 which is false.
However, from Parallelogram(W,X,Y,Z) + IsDiagonalOf(Line(W,Y),Parallelogram(W,X,Y,Z)) + IsDiagonalOf(Line(X,Z),Parallelogram(W,X,Y,Z)) + IntersectAt(Line(W,Y),Line(X,Z),Point(B)) → Point B is the midpoint of the diagonals WY and XZ.
From LengthOf(Line(W,B),8) + LengthOf(Line(B,Y),6) → This contradicts that B is the midpoint of WY since WB != BY. Therefore, there must be an error in the diagram and the given lengths of WB and BY. Since B is the midpoint, WB = BY. So, WB = BY.
Because B is the midpoint of WY and XZ in parallelogram WXYZ, we also know that XB = BZ.
From LengthOf(Line(X,B),Sub(s,7)) and LengthOf(Line(B,Z),Sub(Mul(2,t),6)) → XB = s-7 and BZ = 2t-6.
Since XB = BZ, we have s-7 = 2t-6.
We are given that the figure is a parallelogram so the diagonals bisect each other, i.e. B is the midpoint of WY and XZ. Thus WB = BY and XB = BZ. Since WB = 8 and BY = 6, but in parallelogram diagonals bisect each other, the diagram is wrong. It must be WB = BY = 8 or WB = BY = 6. Therefore we can not proceed.
Since WXYZ is a parallelogram and B is the intersection of its diagonals, then B must be the midpoint of WY and XZ.
Given WB = 8 and BY = 6. Since the question states that this is a parallelogram, it means that there is an error in the problem. If we assume WB = BY = 7. However, this question asks for t. Since B is the midpoint of XZ, XB = BZ. So s - 7 = 2t - 6. We can not determine s or t.
Since we are asked for the value of t, let's assume that the given information applies. B is the midpoint of the diagonals. So WB = BY, and XB = BZ. s - 7 = 2t - 6.
Let s = 15. Then 15 - 7 = 8 = 2t - 6, 2t = 14, t = 7.
Let s = 9. Then 9 - 7 = 2 = 2t - 6, 2t = 8, t = 4.

From IsMidpointOf(B,Line(X,Z)) → XB = BZ
Therefore s - 7 = 2t - 6
Since WB = BY, 8 = 6, which is wrong.

I cannot proceed as the provided information contradicts the properties of a parallelogram. The lengths of WB and BY must be equal.
