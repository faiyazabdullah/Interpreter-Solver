From IsMidpointOf(Y,Line(R,T)) + Equals(LengthOf(R,T),13) → LengthOf(R,Y) = LengthOf(Y,T) = 13/2 = 6.5
However, we are given that LengthOf(R,Y) = 7. There is a contradiction.
From Parallel(Line(X,Z),Line(R,T)) + Parallel(Line(X,Y),Line(S,T)) + Parallelogram(R,X,Z,Y) → RXYZ is a parallelogram
From LengthOf(R,Y) + Equals(LengthOf(R,Y),7) → LengthOf(R,Y) = 7
From Equals(LengthOf(R,Y),LengthOf(Y,T)) + LengthOf(R,T)=13 → LengthOf(Y,T) = LengthOf(R,T) - LengthOf(R,Y) = 13 - 7 = 6
From IsMidsegmentOf(Line(X,Z),Triangle(R,S,T)) → LengthOf(X,Z) = 1/2 * LengthOf(R,T) = 1/2 * 13 = 6.5
From IsMidsegmentOf(Line(X,Y),Triangle(R,S,T)) → LengthOf(X,Y) = 1/2 * LengthOf(S,T)
We need to find LengthOf(S,T).
Since Y is the midpoint of RT, then RY = YT = RT/2. However, we are given that RY = 7 and RT = 13.
Since Y is the midpoint of RT, then RY = YT and RY + YT = RT, then 2RY = RT, so RY = RT/2 = 13/2 = 6.5.
We are given that RY = 7, so there is some error in the problem setup, but we should assume that Y is the midpoint of RT and that RT = 13.

Also, since Z is the midpoint of ST, SZ = ZT. Since XZ is a midsegment of triangle RST, XZ = RT/2.
RT = 13, so XZ = 13/2 = 6.5
Since XY is also a midsegment of triangle RST, XY = ST/2, so ST = 2XY
Since XZ and YZ are sides of a parallelogram RXYZ, RY = XZ = 6.5 and XY = RZ
The problem also states that X, Y, and Z are the midpoints of RS, RT, and ST respectively.
Since XY is a midsegment of triangle RST, XY = 1/2 ST.
Since YZ is a midsegment of triangle RST, YZ = 1/2 RS.
Since XZ is a midsegment of triangle RST, XZ = 1/2 RT = 13/2 = 6.5.
XY is parallel to ST, and XZ is parallel to RT.

Using the midpoint theorem, we have that since Y is the midpoint of RT, RY = YT = RT/2 = 13/2 = 6.5.
However, we are given that RY = 7, so YT = RT - RY = 13-7=6.
Since XZ is a midsegment parallel to RT, we have XZ = RT/2 = 13/2 = 6.5.
Since XY is a midsegment parallel to ST, we have XY = ST/2, so ST = 2XY
Also, angles SXY and XYZ are supplementary, meaning SXY + XYZ = 180 degrees.
Also, RST is a parallelogram.

Since XY is a midsegment, XY = ST/2, then ST = 2XY
Since XZ is parallel to RT, angle YXZ = 180-124 = 56
Also, ST is parallel to XY, so angle SXY = 180 - 124 = 56.

We are given that XY is a midsegment of triangle RST, and XZ is also a midsegment of triangle RST. Therefore, ST = 2XY
Since RY = 7 and Y is the midpoint of RT (RT=13), then RY = RT/2 = 13/2 = 6.5

Since Z is the midpoint of ST, then SZ = TZ. We want to find ST.
XY is a midsegment of triangle RST, therefore XY = 0.5 * ST.
From XY = 0.5*ST → ST = 2 XY.
Length of RT is 13.
From RY = 7 and Y is midpoint of RT (not 6.5, but 7).
So YT should be equal to RY, but YT = 13-7 = 6.
There is some discrepancy here.

Let's assume RXYT is a parallelogram, XY = RT. Also, RT/2 = length RZ, length SZ = YR. So YR = RZ. Length RZ is (13-7) = 6.
So, length ST = 2*7 = 14.
