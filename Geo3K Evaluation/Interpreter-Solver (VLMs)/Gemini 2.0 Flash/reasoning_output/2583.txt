From Parallel(L,P,K,Q) and Parallel(K,Q,J,R) and Parallel(J,R,H,S), we have that lines HS, JR, KQ, and LP are parallel.

Let M L = x.
From Parallel(L,P,K,Q), using triangle HSM and similar triangles, we have H K / H J = H L / H M = K Q / R J = L P / S R
From PointLiesOnLine(J,H,M), PointLiesOnLine(K,H,M), PointLiesOnLine(L,H,M), PointLiesOnLine(R,S,M), PointLiesOnLine(Q,S,M), PointLiesOnLine(P,S,M), we have that J, K, L lie on line HM, and R, Q, P lie on line SM.
Given that L K = 4, K J = 2, M P = 3, P Q = 6, R S = 6, and L P = 2.
Then we have L K / K J = 4 / 2 = 2, and P Q / L P = 6 / 2 = 3.
Also, let M L = x. Then M P = 3, so M P / L P = 3 / 2 = 1.5

By similar triangles, consider triangle HP'L' inside triangle HK'Q' inside triangle HJ'R'. Since LP, KQ, JR, HS are parallel, we have the following ratios:
M L / L P = L K / K Q = K J / J R

Then we have that L K / K J = 4 / 2 = 2. Also, M P = 3 and P Q = 6, so Q P / P M = 6 / 3 = 2.
Let M L = x.

Consider triangle H S M. We have segments JR, KQ, and LP that are parallel to HS. Therefore, by similar triangles we can write the following proportions:
S R / R Q = H J / J K
R Q / Q P = J K / K L
Q P / P M = K L / L H
From the given values, we have R S = 6, P Q = 6, M P = 3, K J = 2, L K = 4, and L P = 2.
Then we have S R = 6, R Q = ?, Q P = 6, P M = 3.
Let R Q = y.

Since LP is parallel to HS, then ML / MS = LP / HS
Also since LP is parallel to KQ, then ML / MQ = LP / KQ
Since KQ is parallel to JR, then MQ / MR = KQ / JR
Since JR is parallel to HS, then MR / MS = JR / HS

Also S R / R Q = H J / J K implies 6 / y = H J / 2, so H J = 12 / y.
Also R Q / Q P = J K / K L implies y / 6 = 2 / 4 = 1 / 2, so y = 3.
Then S R = 6, R Q = 3, Q P = 6, and P M = 3.
Since Q P / P M = K L / L H implies 6 / 3 = 4 / L H, so L H = 2.
M L = x.
Since the lines are parallel, we have the following ratio:
M L / L K / K J = M P / P Q / Q R = x / 4 / 2 = 3 / 6 / 3 = 1/2 / 1/2 = 1.
If we take M P / P Q, then we get 3 / 6 = 1/2.
If we take P Q / Q R, then we get 6 / 3 = 2.
If we take M P / Q R, then we get 3 / 3 = 1.

Thus M L / L K = M P / P Q. This gives x / 4 = 3 / 6. Thus, x = 4 * (3/6) = 4 * 1/2 = 2.
Then M L = 2.
