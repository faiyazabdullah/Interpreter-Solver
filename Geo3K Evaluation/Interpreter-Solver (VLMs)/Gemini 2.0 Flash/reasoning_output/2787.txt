1. ANALYZE & EXTRACT
- We are given a circle with center B.
- Points Q, A, and S lie on the circle.
- Line ST is tangent to the circle at S.
- Line QC and AR are secants to the circle.
- Angle ARS = 71 degrees.
- Arc QS = 106 degrees.
- We want to find the measure of arc QTS.

2. DEDUCE SYSTEMATICALLY
- From Tangent(Line(S,T),Circle(B)) → Angle between tangent ST and chord AS is half the intercepted arc AS.
- Angle RSA = 71 degrees.
- Angle QAS = 1/2 * Arc QS = 1/2 * 106 = 53 degrees.
- From IntersectAt(Line(A,R),Line(R,S),Line(R,S),Point(R)) + IntersectAt(Line(S,T),Line(R,S),Line(R,S),Point(S)) → Triangle ARS is formed.
- In triangle ARS, angle RAS = 180 - (71 + Angle ASR).
- Angle ASR is the supplementary angle to the angle between the tangent ST and the chord AS. The angle between the tangent ST and the chord AS is half the intercepted arc AS. So the Angle ASR + (1/2 * Arc AS) = 180 degrees.
- In triangle ARS, we know angle ARS = 71. We want to find Angle ASR.
- Angle RAS = 180 - (Angle ARS + Angle ASR) = 180 - (71 + Angle ASR).
- We know that Angle QAS = 53. Therefore, Angle QAR + Angle RAS = Angle QAS, where Angle QAR = 53.
- In triangle ARS, angle ARS is 71. Let the point of intersection of ST and RA be R. Since ST is a tangent to circle B at point S, then the inscribed angle theorem states the angle between the tangent and chord is 1/2 the measure of the arc. Thus, angle ASR is 180 - angle RST.
- Angle ASR is supplementary to Angle TSA, which is the angle formed by the tangent ST and the chord SA. The inscribed angle theorem states that Angle TSA is half the measure of arc SA.
- Angle RSA is 71 degrees. We know angle QAS = 53 degrees. The measure of Arc QS = 106.
- Since the total arc around the circle is 360 degrees, then Arc QS + Arc SA + Arc AQ = 360.
- Angle ARS is 71 degrees.
- 1/2(Arc AS) = 180-Angle ASR is the relation between inscribed angles.
- Consider the triangle ARS. Angle ARS is 71 degrees. We have no information about Angle RAS or Angle ASR.

- Since Arc QS = 106 degrees, the rest of the circle is 360-106 = 254 degrees.
Arc QTS = 360 - Arc QS = 360 - 106 = 254 degrees.

3. CONCLUDE & SELECT
The measure of arc QTS is 254 degrees.
