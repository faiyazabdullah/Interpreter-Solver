From PointLiesOnLine(A,Line(A,D)) + PointLiesOnLine(B,Line(A,D)) + PointLiesOnLine(C,Line(A,D)) + PointLiesOnLine(D,Line(A,D)) → A, B, C, and D are collinear.
From PointLiesOnLine(J,Line(A,D)) + PointLiesOnLine(K,Line(A,D)) → J and K are collinear with A, B, C, and D.
From IsRadiusOf(K,C,Circle(K)) → LengthOf(K,C) is the radius of circle K.
From IsRadiusOf(K,D,Circle(K)) → LengthOf(K,D) is the radius of circle K.
From Equals(RadiusOf(Circle(K)),8) → LengthOf(K,C) = 8.
From Equals(RadiusOf(Circle(K)),8) → LengthOf(K,D) = 8.
From the problem statement, LengthOf(B,C) = 5.4
The question asks for the length of CK.
From the diagram, C K is K C.
From Equals(LengthOf(K,C),8) → C K = 8.
The problem statement says, "Find C K."
Because Equals(LengthOf(K,C),8) and Equals(LengthOf(K,D),8), the radius of Circle(K) = 8, and C and D are on circle K.
There seems to be an error in the answer choices. However, C K = 8.
I am going to re-read the question.
The question states: Circle J has a radius of 10 units, \odot K has a radius of 8 units, and B C = 5.4 units. Find C K.
From the predicates, Equals(LengthOf(B,C),5.4). Therefore, the distance between B and C is 5.4.
From Equals(LengthOf(K,C),8) → K C = 8. C K = K C.

The question is specifically asking us to find the length of CK.
The question is not asking for the radius. It is asking for C K.
We already determined that length of C K is 8.
The given choices are A. 2.4 B. 2.6 C. 2.8 D. 4.
Since C K = 8, none of the options are correct.
There may be missing information. The problem may be asking us to find a length other than the radius.
