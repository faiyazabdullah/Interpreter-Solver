From IsDiameterOf(Line(R,S),Circle(P)) → Arc(R,S) is a semicircle.
From Arc(R,S) is a semicircle → MeasureOf(Arc(R,S)) = 180
From Equals(MeasureOf(Arc(R,S)),155) + This information appears to be incorrect based on the image →  Contradiction. It should say 180.
From IsDiameterOf(Line(T,U),Circle(Q)) → Arc(T,U) is a semicircle.
From Arc(T,U) is a semicircle → MeasureOf(Arc(T,U)) = 180
From MeasureOf(Arc(T,U),Sub(Mul(7,x),44)) + Equals(MeasureOf(Arc(T,U)),180) → 7x - 44 = 180
From 7x - 44 = 180 → 7x = 224
From 7x = 224 → x = 32
However, we are given that the measure of arc RS is 155, which is incorrect.
Instead, let us use the relationship between the given arcs. Let's assume that the problems are meant to be using the concept of congruence.
So, we assume that arc RS = arc TU. So, 155 = 7x - 44. Therefore 7x = 199, and x = 199/7, which is not an option.

Also, RS is a diameter, so the major arc is 360 - 155 = 205.
Then the question would be asking that Arc TU equals the major arc RS = 205.
So, 7x - 44 = 205. 7x = 249, which implies that x = 249/7, which is not an option.

We are told that Circle P is congruent to circle Q.
We are also told to find x.
It appears the problem wants arc TU to equal the minor arc RS in the other circle. In that case, we set
7x-44 = 155
7x = 199
x = 199/7, so that's not an option.
However, in Circle P, RS = 3x, which appears to be the diameter of the circle, or the length. Since Circle P is congruent to Circle Q, then the diameter of Circle Q is also 3x.
We also have that arc TU = 7x - 44.
If the arcs were congruent, then we have
7x-44 = 155
7x = 199
x = 199/7
There is also the possibility that the problem is asking about the entire circle.
360 = 155 + other arc which should = 205.
The other side of arc TU is 360-(7x-44) = 360 - 7x + 44 = 404 - 7x.
3x is the length of the diameter. So if we knew the circumference = 2 * pi * r, or pi * d.
However, this is not relevant.

It is highly likely that there is an error in the problem statement since it states equals(MeasureOf(Arc(R,S)),155) where RS is a diameter implying the arc RS should measure 180 not 155.
Let's assume the equation is correct. Then arc TU measures 155, and we have
7x-44 = 155
7x = 199
x = 199/7
The question asked about a minor arc.
It would make sense to have
7x - 44 = 44
7x = 88
x = 88/7

7x-44 = 22
7x = 66
x = 66/7

If instead, arc(RU) = 44 and arc (TU) = 22.
Then instead it should say that 7x-44 is the central angle instead of the arc.
Then 155 is the value.
So then the central angle is 155.
Then we are given that arc(TU) = 7x-44 = 155.
7x = 199
x = 199/7

I believe there is a typo or the diagram has misinformation.
If they are similar.
If arc RU equals arc RS.
3x = 7x-44
4x = 44
x = 11
