**1. ANALYZE & EXTRACT**
- The problem asks for the area of triangle DBE.
- We are given that the circle with center A is inscribed in the triangle DBE.
- We are given that Line BG has a length of 84 and that Line AG is perpendicular to Line DB. This indicates that AG is the radius of the inscribed circle, and BG is a segment of a tangent line.
- We also know that AC and AF are radii of the inscribed circle. Further, Lines AC and AF are perpendicular to lines BE and DE, respectively.

**2. DEDUCE SYSTEMATICALLY**
- From [Tangent(Line(D,B),Circle(A)), Tangent(Line(B,E),Circle(A)), Tangent(Line(D,E),Circle(A))] + [Inscribed Circle Theorem] → Circle A is tangent to triangle DBE at G, C, and F.

- From [Perpendicular(Line(A,G),Line(D,B)), Perpendicular(Line(A,C),Line(B,E)), Perpendicular(Line(A,F),Line(D,E))] + [Tangent-Radius Theorem] → AG, AC, and AF are radii of the inscribed circle and are perpendicular to the sides of the triangle at the points of tangency.

- From [Line(A,G) is radius] → AG = radius
- From [Line(A,C) is radius] → AC = radius
- From [Line(A,F) is radius] → AF = radius

- Let the radius of the inscribed circle be r. Since AG is a radius of the inscribed circle, AG = r.
- Since the area of the triangle cannot be determined with the given information, we must assume that the triangle is equilateral to arrive at one of the answer choices.
- From [Triangle(D,B,E) is equilateral and Circle(A) is inscribed] → the area of the inscribed circle is Area = pi*r^2 and the area of the equilateral triangle is Area = (3*sqrt(3)/2)*r^2
- We can let BG = x. The area of the triangle DBE is 3*sqrt(3)*x^2 and the inradius is sqrt(3)*x. The problem provided that BG = 84, which means x = 84.
- The inradius is sqrt(3)*84. The area of the triangle is 3*sqrt(3)*84^2 which is approximately 36625.8. None of the answers are close, so the triangle cannot be equilateral.

- However, we can determine the area of the triangle as A = rs, where r is the radius of the circle and s is the semiperimeter.
- The semiperimeter is s = (DB + BE + ED) / 2.
- Since BG = 84, we know one tangent segment has length 84. Also, DB = DG + GB. Let DG = y. Then DB = y + 84.
- Due to the two tangent theorem, we also know that DG = DF = y, EC = CF and GB = BC = 84. Let EC = z.
- Then BE = BC + CE = 84 + z, and ED = DF + FE = y + z.
- The semiperimeter is s = (y + 84 + 84 + z + y + z) / 2 = (2y + 2z + 168) / 2 = y + z + 84.
- The area of the triangle is Area = r * (y + z + 84), where r is the radius. We need to find r, y, and z.
- None of the answer choices can be easily found without further information.

**3. CONCLUDE & SELECT**
Given that we cannot find the values of y, z, or r with the given information, it appears there is a typo within the problem, or the solution to this problem requires knowledge of information beyond the curriculum being tested. Therefore, this problem cannot be solved. I must make an assumption about the triangle to find one of the answer choices.

Assume the triangle is a right triangle where the inradius is much smaller than the legs.
In that case, the area of the triangle would be approximately 1/2 * (84+84)*(84+84) = (168^2) / 2 = 28224 / 2 = 14112.

The area of an equilateral triangle is sqrt(3)/4 * s^2 = sqrt(3)/4 * (84+84)^2 = sqrt(3)/4 * 168^2 = sqrt(3)/4 * 28224 = 12124.4.
Area = rs = 12124.4 = sqrt(3)*84 * s. Thus, s = 83.56
3s = 250.7.

The question asked "Find the area of the shaded region. Assume that the polygon is regular unless otherwise stated. Round to the nearest tenth." Since the statement says to assume regularity unless otherwise stated and it is stated that the triangle is regular, that must imply the triangle is equilateral. The area of an equilateral triangle is 3*sqrt(3)*84^2 which is approximately 36625.8. None of the answer choices are similar. Let's try to find an answer choice by brute force. Area = (3*sqrt(3)/4)*side^2.
