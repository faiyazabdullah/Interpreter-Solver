**1. ANALYZE & EXTRACT**
- We are given a geometric figure with several lines and points.
- Length of EC is 14 ft.
- Length of EL is 9 ft.
- Rectangle ELIC is present.
- Several parallel and perpendicular relationships are indicated.
- Question: Find the area of the entire figure, i.e., AreaOf(Shape(Shaded)).

**2. DEDUCE SYSTEMATICALLY**
- From Rectangle(E,L,I,C), LengthOf(E,C,14), LengthOf(E,L,9) â†’  LengthOf(I,C) = 9 and LengthOf(L,I) = 14.
- AreaOf(E,L,C,H) represents the area of the entire shape. It consists of parallelogram ECHB, plus triangles AEH, GFB. Since ABCD is inscribed inside, ECHB = 2*area(ABCD). area(Shaded) = area(parallelogram)+ area(ABCD).
- Area(rectangle ELIC) = EL * EC = 9 * 14 = 126.
- The area of the parallelogram ECHB is twice the area of parallelogram ABCD because the height and base of ECHB are twice that of ABCD.
- Area of the shaded region can be calculated by subtracting area of parallelogram ABCD from the area of entire shape.
- The height of parallelogram ABCD is IC/2 = 9/2 = 4.5. The length of its base AB is LI/2 = 14/2 = 7.
- Area of parallelogram ABCD = base * height = 7 * 4.5 = 31.5.
- Area(E,C,H,B) is a parallelogram. The height of this parallelogram = EL = 9 and base = EC = 14. Area of parallelogram ECHB = 14*9 = 126.
- Consider the shape ECHB with vertices E,C,H,B. Area of the shaded region is the area of the parallelogram ECHB plus the 2 additional triangles. Area of parallelogram ECHB = 126. The two triangles' areas add up to equal area ABCD = 31.5. Shaded Area = 126 + 31.5 =157.5. This is not one of the given choices.
- Area of shaded region = Area parallelogram ECHB + Area of triangle AEG + Area of triangle BFH
- Since AB || EC and AD || BC, ABCD is a parallelogram.
- Area(ECHB) = EC * h, where h is height. h= EL = 9.  So area = 14 * 9 = 126.
Since points A,B,C,D are midpoints, the unshaded region ABCD is 1/2 area of parallelogram ECHB = 63. Therefore shaded region = 126 - 63.
Therefore, area of unshaded region A,B,C,D = AB * IC = 7 * 4.5 = 31.5. This is wrong.
I must consider the height is equal to EL which is 9. So, the perpendicular distance is 9. Base is EC = 14. Therefore, area of total parallelogram ECHB is 9*14= 126. The area of ABCD will be half of that since its length and width are halved.
Therefore the shaded area = total area - the area of the unshaded region = 126-63.

The area of ABCD is half the area of parallelogram ECHB = 1/2 * (9 * 14) = 63. So, total shaded area = 126 + (126-63) = 126+63 = Area parallelogram(ECHB) + area parallelogram(ABCD) = 126 + 31.5

The area of ECHB parallelogram can be assumed with height = length EL = 9, and base = EC=14. The remaining area = Area ECHB.
Shaded area equals area parallelogram plus area of parallelogram. Thus area = 126. Half of area = =63.
126

**3. CONCLUDE & SELECT**
The area of the shape is 126.
