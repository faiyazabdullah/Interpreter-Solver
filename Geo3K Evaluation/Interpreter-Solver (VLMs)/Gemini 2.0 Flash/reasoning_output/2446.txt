From Point(A), Point(B), Point(C), Point(R), Point(S), Point(T), Point(M) and IntersectAt(A,T,B,S,C,R,M) + Equals(LengthOf(A,R),LengthOf(R,C)), Equals(LengthOf(A,S),LengthOf(S,B)), Equals(LengthOf(B,T),LengthOf(T,C)) → R, S, T are midpoints of A-C, A-B, B-C respectively.
From IsMidpointOf(R,A,C), IsMidpointOf(S,A,B), IsMidpointOf(T,B,C) → AT, BS, CR are medians of triangle ABC.
From IntersectAt(A,T,B,S,C,R,M) → M is the intersection of the medians of triangle ABC.
From M is the intersection of the medians of triangle ABC → M is the centroid of triangle ABC.
From IsCentroidOf(M,Triangle(A,B,C)) → RatioOf(LengthOf(B,M),LengthOf(M,S),2,1), RatioOf(LengthOf(A,M),LengthOf(M,T),2,1), RatioOf(LengthOf(C,M),LengthOf(M,R),2,1).
From LengthOf(M,C,7) and RatioOf(LengthOf(C,M),LengthOf(M,R),2,1) → LengthOf(C,M) = 7, LengthOf(M,R) = 7/2. This contradicts LengthOf(R,M,4), therefore this is an image of a different type of problem. There is no logical way to determine the answer from what is given. However, since M is the centroid of triangle ABC → RatioOf(LengthOf(B,M),LengthOf(M,S),2,1). This relation can be written as BM = 2*MS.
From LengthOf(A,T,16) and RatioOf(LengthOf(A,M),LengthOf(M,T),2,1) → LengthOf(A,M) = (2/3)*16, LengthOf(M,T) = (1/3)*16 = 16/3
From LengthOf(C,M,7) and RatioOf(LengthOf(C,M),LengthOf(M,R),2,1) → LengthOf(M,R) = 7/2 = 3.5. This contradicts LengthOf(R,M,4). It appears to be an image generated by an AI from constraints given.

Based on the assumption that LengthOf(C,M,7) and LengthOf(R,M,4) are correct, then LengthOf(C,M) = 2*LengthOf(M,R) → 7 = 2*4 → 7=8, which is not true.

Based on the assumption that LengthOf(A,T,16) is correct, then LengthOf(M,T) = AT/3 = 16/3 and LengthOf(A,M) = 2*AT/3 = 32/3.

Regardless, since BM = 2*MS, and there is no length known, then there is no possible way to determine the length of BM. The only way to determine this would be to assume some other constraint, such as BM = AT. If BM = AT = 16, then MS = 8. Therefore it is not possible to determine from the information known.

There must be some error or missing information within the problem.
RatioOf(LengthOf(C,M),LengthOf(M,R),2,1) → LengthOf(C,M) = 2*LengthOf(M,R) = 2*4 = 8. However LengthOf(C,M,7). This is therefore a contradictory result. We can determine if M B = 2*MS, and AT = 16, then AM = (2/3)AT = 32/3 and MT = AT/3 = 16/3. If BM = x, then MS = x/2.

There is an error within the question. It is not possible to determine from what is given. However, if the value of RM was supposed to be 3.5 instead of 4, then the centroid theorem would be consistent. It is impossible to solve without that consistency.
