====================================================================================================
From Quadrilateral(Q,R,S,P) + IsDiagonalOf(Line(Q,S),Quadrilateral(Q,R,S,P)) + IsDiagonalOf(Line(R,P),Quadrilateral(Q,R,S,P)) + IntersectAt(Line(Q,S),Line(R,P),Line(Q,S),Point(T)) + IsMidpointOf(Point(T),Line(Q,S)) + IsMidpointOf(Point(T),Line(R,P)) → Quadrilateral Q,R,S,P is a parallelogram because its diagonals bisect each other.

From IsMidpointOf(Point(T),Line(Q,S)) → LengthOf(Line(Q,T)) = LengthOf(Line(T,S)).
From LengthOf(Line(Q,T),Mul(5,y)) and LengthOf(Line(R,S),Add(Mul(2,y),12)) and LengthOf(Line(T,S)) = LengthOf(Line(Q,T)) → 5y + 5y = 2y + 12 since opposite sides of parallelogram are equal and diagonals bisect each other. However, we can solve for y by using the fact that T is the midpoint of RP, so RT = TP.

From IsMidpointOf(Point(T),Line(R,P)) → LengthOf(Line(R,T)) = LengthOf(Line(T,P))
From LengthOf(Line(R,T),x) and LengthOf(Line(T,P),Sub(Mul(5,x),28)) and LengthOf(Line(R,T)) = LengthOf(Line(T,P)) → x = 5x - 28
From x = 5x - 28 → 4x = 28 → x = 7

From Quadrilateral(Q,R,S,P) is a parallelogram → LengthOf(Line(Q,R)) = LengthOf(Line(S,P)) and LengthOf(Line(R,S)) = LengthOf(Line(Q,P))
From LengthOf(Line(Q,R),x) and LengthOf(Line(R,S),Add(Mul(2,y),12)) and LengthOf(Line(Q,P),Sub(Mul(5,x),28)) → x = SP and RS = QP
Since opposite sides of parallelogram are equal: QR = SP and RS = QP
So, x = SP and 2y + 12 = QP.

From IsMidpointOf(Point(T),Line(R,P)) → RT = TP
Therefore x = 5x - 28. 4x = 28, so x = 7
Also LengthOf(Line(Q,P)) = LengthOf(Line(R,S)).
Thus 5x - 28 = 2y + 12. Substituting x=7:
5(7) - 28 = 2y + 12
35 - 28 = 2y + 12
7 = 2y + 12
2y = -5
y = -2.5

Now considering adjacent sides, RS and SP are not equal.
LengthOf(Line(Q,P)) = LengthOf(Line(R,S)). So 5x - 28 = 2y + 12
Since QRSP is a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal.
QR = SP and RS = QP.
So x = SP and 2y + 12 = 5x - 28
2y + 12 = 5x - 28. And the diagonals RT = TP so x = 5x - 28 and QT = TS, thus 5y = TS. So QS = 10y.
Since T is the midpoint of RP, then x = 5x - 28 which gives x=7.
So 2y + 12 = 5(7) - 28 = 35 - 28 = 7
2y = -5
y = -2.5

However, since diagonals bisect each other, then RT = TP and QT = TS
So x = 5x - 28 implies x = 7
Also QT = TS implies 5y = TS and TS = 1/2 * QS
RP and QS bisect each other. R,T,P and Q,T,S are collinear respectively.
Then RT = TP, so x = 5x - 28.
Also QT = TS, so 5y = TS

The given information is that T is the midpoint of both diagonals. For a quadrilateral to be a parallelogram, it is sufficient for the diagonals to bisect each other. Since that condition is already met, we can determine the lengths of the sides.

Since T is the midpoint of QS, then QT = TS or 5y = TS. We also know that RS = 2y+12, but RS and QP are opposite sides of the parallelogram. So 2y+12 = QP. Also, QTSP is a parallelogram. x = QR = PS and (5y-28) = TP = RT = x. So x = RT.
Also RP = 2x.
So in quadrilateral QRSP the only given value is that each diagonal has been bisected. The only thing we need to figure out is whether QR = PS and QP = RS or x = PS and 2y+12 = QP.
If quadrilateral is a parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other. Also QP = 5x-28 and RS = 2y+12.
If the figure is a parallelogram, 5x-28 = 2y+12.
Since x=7, 5(7) - 28 = 35-28 = 7. Therefore 2y+12 = 7 and 2y = -5, giving y = -2.5
Let's try with RT = TP and QT = TS. The parallelogram has opposite sides are equal. So then SP = QR and RS = QP. Therefore x = PS. so PS = RT+PT = 2x. And QP = RS. So PS =QR = x =7.

From the problem, since T is the midpoint of RP, RT = TP, therefore x = 5x -28 and then 4x = 28 and x = 7.
Since QTSP is a parallelogram, we have QP = RS. therefore, 5x - 28 = 2y + 12 and QP =RS = 7
5(7) - 28 = 35 - 28 = 7, therefore 2y + 12 = 7, 2y = -5, y=-5/2
