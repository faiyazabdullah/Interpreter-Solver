From Parallelogram(A,B,C,D) + IsDiagonalOf(Line(B,D),Parallelogram(A,B,C,D)) + IsDiagonalOf(Line(A,C),Parallelogram(A,B,C,D)) + IntersectAt(Line(A,C),Line(B,D),Line(A,C),Point(F)) → F is the intersection of the diagonals of parallelogram ABCD.
From Parallelogram(A,B,C,D) + Intersection of diagonals at F → IsMidpointOf(F,Line(B,D)) and IsMidpointOf(F,Line(A,C)).
From IsMidpointOf(F,Line(B,D)) → Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,F)),LengthOf(Line(F,D))).
From Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,F)),Add(z,5)) → LengthOf(Line(B,F)) = z + 5.
Since opposite sides of a parallelogram are congruent, Line(C,B) is parallel to Line(A,D).
We are given LengthOf(Line(C,E)) = 3z - 4.
Since the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other, BF = FD. We are given BF = z + 5.

However, no additional information allows direct calculation of z, other than the fact that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.

Because F is the midpoint of BD, we have BF = z + 5.
We are given the length of CE is 3z - 4. However, we do not know any relationships between CE and BF.

Let us assume the problem meant to ask about the case where the point E is such that CB = 3z-4. Then, we would have 3z-4 = CB, and since CB is parallel to AD, they are not related to the diagonals.

Let's see if we can form any triangles to solve for z.
Since the diagonals bisect each other, AF = FC and BF = FD. BF = z + 5. CE = 3z - 4.
There is not enough information to directly calculate z from the given information.

However, we know that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. Therefore, the given information that BF = z+5 is correct.
Then consider the case where the location of point E matters. The line CE has length 3z - 4.
If point E coincided with point B, then 3z-4 = 0, or z = 4/3. This means that E cannot equal B.
If point E coincided with point C, then CE = 0. Then 3z-4 = 0, and so z = 4/3.
There are no relationships between CE and BF that can be directly related.
However, given that the problem likely intended the diagonals to be equal, it is possible that we need to consider when CE = BE.
There is no easy solution.

However, the most reasonable assumption is that the length of BF, which is z+5, is related somehow to the length CE, 3z-4. It may have been the intention to create the equation z+5 = 3z-4. Then 2z = 9, z = 4.5
