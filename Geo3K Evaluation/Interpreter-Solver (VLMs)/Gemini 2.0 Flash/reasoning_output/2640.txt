From PointLiesOnCircle(A,Circle(B)) + PointLiesOnCircle(B,Circle(B)) + PointLiesOnCircle(C,Circle(B)) → Points A, B, and C lie on circle B.
From MeasureOf(Angle(CAB)) = Mul(3,x) + MeasureOf(Angle(ACB)) = Add(Mul(4,x),50) → ∠CAB = 3x and ∠ACB = 4x + 50
From Secant(Line(C,E),Circle(B)) + Secant(Line(D,E),Circle(B)) → Angle CED is formed by two secants intersecting outside the circle.
From MeasureOf(Angle(CED)) = 30 + Secant-Secant Angle Theorem → ∠CED = 1/2 * (Measure of arc CB - Measure of arc AB)
From inscribed angle theorem → Measure of arc AB = 2 * ∠ACB = 2 * (4x + 50) = 8x + 100
From inscribed angle theorem → Measure of arc CB = 2 * ∠CAB = 2 * (3x) = 6x
From ∠CED = 1/2 * (Measure of arc CB - Measure of arc AB) → 30 = 1/2 * (6x - (8x + 100))
From 30 = 1/2 * (6x - (8x + 100)) → 60 = 6x - 8x - 100
From 60 = 6x - 8x - 100 → 60 = -2x - 100
From 60 = -2x - 100 → 160 = -2x
From 160 = -2x → x = -80

There must be an error since x cannot be negative. Angle CED = 1/2 * (arc CB - arc AB)
30 = 1/2 (2(3x) - 2(4x+50))
30 = 1/2 (6x - 8x - 100)
60 = -2x - 100
160 = -2x
x = -80

There is an alternative theorem - the angle formed by two secants is half the difference of the intercepted arcs.
∠CED = (1/2) | arc CB - arc AB |
arc CB = 2 * 3x = 6x
arc AB = 2 * (4x+50) = 8x + 100
30 = (1/2) | 6x - (8x+100) |
60 = | -2x - 100 |
-2x - 100 = 60 or -2x - 100 = -60
-2x = 160 or -2x = 40
x = -80 or x = -20
Since x must be positive, there must be an error.

Let us reconsider the relationships between the angles. If we consider triangle ACE, we have that
∠CAE = 3x
∠ACE = 4x + 50
∠AEC = 180 - ∠CED = 180 - 30 = 150
The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180, so 3x + 4x + 50 + 150 = 180
7x + 200 = 180
7x = -20
x = -20/7.
Again, a contradiction.

Let's review what's given. Central Angle Theorem: An inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
30 = 1/2 (arc AC - arc AB)
Angle CAB = 3x, Angle ACB = 4x + 50
Arc CB = 2(3x) = 6x
Arc AB = 2(4x + 50) = 8x + 100
Then, 30 = 1/2 | 6x - (8x + 100) |
60 = | -2x - 100 |
Then, -2x - 100 = 60 OR -2x - 100 = -60
-160 = 2x OR -40 = 2x
x = -80 or x = -20
This doesn't work.
The formula m<CED = (1/2)(m arc BC - m arc BA)
