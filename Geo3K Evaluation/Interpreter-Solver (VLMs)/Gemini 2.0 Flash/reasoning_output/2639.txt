GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):

From Perpendicular(N,M,M,B) + Perpendicular(N,P,P,A) → Angle NMQ and Angle NPQ are right angles.
From RightAngle(Angle(N,M,Q)) + RightAngle(Angle(N,P,Q)) + Quadrilateral(N,M,Q,P) → Quadrilateral NMQP is cyclic.
From Quadrilateral NMQP is cyclic → Angle QNM + Angle QPM = 180 degrees, and Angle QMN + Angle QPN = 180 degrees.
Since Angle NMQ and Angle NPQ are right angles, NMQP is a cyclic quadrilateral and therefore it can be inscribed in a circle. The sides QM and QP are chords of this circle.
If QM = QP, then angles subtended by chords QM and QP at the center are equal. Also angles QNM and QPN are equal.
If the quadrilateral is a kite with sides NM=NP, then the angles QNM and QPN will be equal and therefore the lengths QM and QP will be equal.

From the information provided, we are given that QM = 2x+2 and QP = 4x-8.
Since the points M and P are the feet of perpendiculars from Q to the lines NB and NA, and also since NMQP is cyclic, the quadrilateral NMQP is a kite if NM = NP and QN is the angle bisector of angle MNP. However, we do not know whether NM = NP and therefore we cannot conclude that it is a kite.

Since M and P are right angles, NMQP is a quadrilateral with two right angles at M and P. Also the figure looks symmetric, with QN being the axis of symmetry.
Let us assume QM = QP. Then 2x+2 = 4x-8
Subtract 2x from both sides: 2 = 2x-8
Add 8 to both sides: 10 = 2x
Divide both sides by 2: x = 5
Then QM = 2x+2 = 2(5) + 2 = 10+2 = 12
QP = 4x-8 = 4(5)-8 = 20-8 = 12
So, QM = QP = 12.
