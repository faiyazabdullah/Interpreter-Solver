1. ANALYZE & EXTRACT
- Polygon EFGHJ is a pentagon.
- The measures of angles F, G, H, and J are given as expressions in x.
- We are asked to find the measure of angle H.
- The formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon is (n-2)*180, where n is the number of sides.  For a pentagon, this is (5-2)*180 = 3*180 = 540 degrees.
- We know that the sum of the interior angles of the pentagon EFGHJ is 540 degrees.

2. DEDUCE SYSTEMATICALLY
From SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(E)),MeasureOf(Angle(F)),MeasureOf(Angle(G)),MeasureOf(Angle(H)),MeasureOf(Angle(J)),540) → measure(E) + measure(F) + measure(G) + measure(H) + measure(J) = 540
From Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(F)),Add(x,20)) → measure(F) = x + 20
From Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(G)),Add(x,5)) → measure(G) = x + 5
From Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(H)),Sub(x,5)) → measure(H) = x - 5
From Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(J)),Add(x,10)) → measure(J) = x + 10

Since the measure of angle E is not given, let's denote it as E.  Then E + (x + 20) + (x + 5) + (x - 5) + (x + 10) = 540
E + 4x + 30 = 540
E = 510 - 4x

The above equation provides an expression of the measure of angle E in terms of x.  However, the problem did not define the measure of angle E.  There appears to be a typo in the diagram in that angle E is labelled as angle F also, indicating that m<E = m<F = x+20.

Then x + 20 + x + 20 + x + 5 + x - 5 + x + 10 = 540
5x + 50 = 540
5x = 490
x = 98

Measure of angle H = x - 5 = 98 - 5 = 93.

If angle E = F, then x+20+x+20+x+5+x-5+x+10 = 540
5x + 50 = 540
5x = 490
x = 98
Then m<H = x - 5 = 98 - 5 = 93

However, there appears to be a mistake in the problem as 93 is not a choice. Let's try assuming that instead, m<E is NOT the same as m<F. Instead we can assume that m<E + x+20+x+5+x-5+x+10 = 540. Thus m<E + 4x + 30 = 540, m<E = 510-4x.
If we assume m<E is not given, we still have the equation.
Let us double check the given choices by substituting x+5 for m<H: then x-5=m<H, so if m<H=97 then x = 102. Then m<F=122, m<G=107, m<H = 97, m<J = 112. Sum m<F + m<G + m<H + m<J = 122+107+97+112 = 438. m<E would then need to be 540-438=102.
If we assume m<H=102, then x=107. m<F=127, m<G = 112, m<J=117. 127+112+102+117 = 458. Then m<E=540-458=82.
If we assume m<H=107, then x=112. m<F=132, m<G=117, m<J=122. 132+117+107+122 = 478. Then m<E=540-478=62.
If we assume m<H=122, then x=127. m<F=147, m<G=132, m<J=137. 147+132+122+137=538. Then m<E=2.

Going back to x = 98, and if m<E = 102, which is choice B for the closest angle, then the initial sum becomes x+20+x+5+x-5+x+10+E= 540, then
98+20+98+5+98-5+98+10+102=526 != 540
It appears the closest is with m<H=107, x=112, m<E=62

If the given measure of angle E=x+20, so 112+20 = 132, we can calculate sum. m<F=132 m<G=117 m<H=107 m<J=122, and E=132, then
132+132+117+107+122=610>540 which is wrong.
