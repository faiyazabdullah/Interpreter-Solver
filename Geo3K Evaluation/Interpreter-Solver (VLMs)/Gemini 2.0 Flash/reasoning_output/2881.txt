From IsIncenterOf(G,Triangle(A,B,C)), Perpendicular(Line(G,D),Line(A,C)), Perpendicular(Line(G,E),Line(A,B)), Perpendicular(Line(G,F),Line(B,C)), Equals(LengthOf(Line(G,D)),LengthOf(Line(G,E))), Equals(LengthOf(Line(G,D)),LengthOf(Line(G,F))), Equals(LengthOf(Line(G,E)),LengthOf(Line(G,F))) → GD = GE = GF = r (inradius of triangle ABC)
From RightAngle(Angle(G,F,C)) → Triangle GFC is a right triangle.
From LengthOf(Line(G,C)) and Equals(LengthOf(Line(G,C)),13), LengthOf(Line(B,C)) and Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)),12), GF = r → In right triangle GFC, GC = 13 and FC = r.  BC = 12
From Pythagoras theorem → GC^2 = GF^2 + FC^2 → 13^2 = r^2 + FC^2
Since G is the incenter, GF is perpendicular to BC, hence, GF is the inradius, call it r. Also, G is equidistant from the sides of the triangle ABC. Therefore, GD=GE=GF = r.
Since G is the incenter of triangle ABC, and GD is perpendicular to AC, GE is perpendicular to AB, and GF is perpendicular to BC, GD, GE, and GF are radii of the incircle of triangle ABC. Therefore, GD = GE = GF = r.

From RightAngle(Angle(G,F,C)) → Triangle(G,F,C) is a right triangle.
From Pythagoras Theorem → GC^2 = GF^2 + FC^2 → 13^2 = GF^2 + FC^2, but GF = r, thus 169 = r^2 + FC^2.
We are trying to find EG, which is the inradius, r.
Let BC = a, AC = b, and AB = c. Let s be the semiperimeter of triangle ABC. The area of triangle ABC, denoted by K, is given by K = rs.

We know BC = 12.
Let's assume that the problem meant to ask to find GF, which equals r.
In right triangle GFC, we have GC = 13, and GF = r. So, FC^2 + r^2 = 13^2. We can't determine r without more information.

From the given information, we can't directly find r. However, looking at the multiple choices, we look for a reasonable value.

However, if we assumed that \triangle ABC is a right triangle, with \angle B = 90 degrees, then we have AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2. We are given BC=12, and GC = 13. That does not directly help. Let r = inradius = GE. Also GD = GE = GF. Also, from visual inspection, the inradius is smaller than 12 and 13, so choices C and D are not reasonable.

Since GE = r, and we can't calculate r directly from given information, there must be a trick.
We are given GC = 13 and BC = 12. Suppose we can find FC.
Since G is the incenter, it is equidistant from all three sides. We know that the perpendicular distance from G to side AC is equal to the perpendicular distance from G to side BC.
We know that triangle GFC is a right triangle, and GC=13. If we assume r = 5, then FC = sqrt(13^2 - 5^2) = sqrt(169 - 25) = sqrt(144) = 12. That would mean that BC = FC = 12.
Given BC = 12, if we assume r = 5, then in \triangle GFC, GF=5, GC=13, thus FC = \sqrt{13^2 - 5^2} = 12. Thus FC = BC. This means that point F = point B, which does not seem likely given the diagram.
If we assume EG=5, then GE=5, then r=5.
