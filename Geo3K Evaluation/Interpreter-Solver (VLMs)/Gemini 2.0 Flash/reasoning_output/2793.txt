GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
From Quadrilateral(A,B,C,D) + The angles of a quadrilateral sum to 360 degrees → MeasureOf(Angle(A)) + MeasureOf(Angle(B)) + MeasureOf(Angle(C)) + MeasureOf(Angle(D)) = 360
From MeasureOf(Angle(A)) = (6x+14) + MeasureOf(Angle(B)) = (6y+16) + MeasureOf(Angle(C)) = (7y+2) + MeasureOf(Angle(D)) = (8x-8) → (6x+14) + (6y+16) + (7y+2) + (8x-8) = 360
From (6x+14) + (6y+16) + (7y+2) + (8x-8) = 360 → 14x + 13y + 24 = 360
From 14x + 13y + 24 = 360 → 14x + 13y = 336

From Quadrilateral(A,B,C,D) + To be a parallelogram, opposite angles must be equal → MeasureOf(Angle(A)) = MeasureOf(Angle(C)) AND MeasureOf(Angle(B)) = MeasureOf(Angle(D))
From MeasureOf(Angle(A)) = (6x+14) AND MeasureOf(Angle(C)) = (7y+2) → (6x+14) = (7y+2)
From (6x+14) = (7y+2) → 6x = 7y - 12
From MeasureOf(Angle(B)) = (6y+16) AND MeasureOf(Angle(D)) = (8x-8) → (6y+16) = (8x-8)
From (6y+16) = (8x-8) → 8x = 6y + 24
From 6x = 7y - 12 → x = (7y - 12) / 6
From 8x = 6y + 24 → x = (6y + 24) / 8
From x = (7y - 12) / 6 AND x = (6y + 24) / 8 → (7y - 12) / 6 = (6y + 24) / 8
From (7y - 12) / 6 = (6y + 24) / 8 → 8(7y - 12) = 6(6y + 24)
From 8(7y - 12) = 6(6y + 24) → 56y - 96 = 36y + 144
From 56y - 96 = 36y + 144 → 20y = 240
From 20y = 240 → y = 12

The question asks to find the value of y for the quadrilateral to be a parallelogram.  So opposite angles must be equal.

MeasureOf(Angle(A)) = MeasureOf(Angle(C))
6x + 14 = 7y + 2
MeasureOf(Angle(B)) = MeasureOf(Angle(D))
6y + 16 = 8x - 8

Solving for x in the first equation
6x = 7y - 12
x = (7y - 12) / 6

Plug into second equation
6y + 16 = 8((7y - 12) / 6)
6y + 16 = (56y - 96) / 6
6(6y + 16) = 56y - 96
36y + 96 = 56y - 96
192 = 20y
y = 9.6

MeasureOf(Angle(A)) + MeasureOf(Angle(B)) = 180 for the quadrialteral to be a parallelogram.
6x + 14 + 6y + 16 = 180
6x + 6y + 30 = 180
6x + 6y = 150
6x = 150 - 6y
x = (150 - 6y) / 6
x = 25 - y

MeasureOf(Angle(A)) = MeasureOf(Angle(C))
6x + 14 = 7y + 2
6x - 7y = -12

Substitute x = 25 - y
6(25 - y) - 7y = -12
150 - 6y - 7y = -12
150 - 13y = -12
162 = 13y
y = 162/13 which is not an answer.

If Angle D + Angle A = 180, then 8x - 8 + 6x + 14 = 180
14x + 6 = 180
14x = 174
x = 174/14 = 87/7

If Angle B + Angle C = 180, then 6y + 16 + 7y + 2 = 180
13y + 18 = 180
13y = 162
y = 162/13 = 12.46 which is not an answer
