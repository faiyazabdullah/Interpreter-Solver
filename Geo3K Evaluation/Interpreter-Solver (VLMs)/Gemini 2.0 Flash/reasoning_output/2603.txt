From Parallel(Line(H,J),Line(J,K)), Parallel(Line(J,K),Line(K,L)), Parallel(Line(K,L),Line(H,S)) â†’ Line(H,J) || Line(J,K) || Line(K,L) || Line(H,S). Since these lines are parallel, and since the points R, Q, P, and M lie on Line(S,M) and the points H, J, K, L, and M lie on Line(H,M), then by the side-splitter theorem, we have the ratios of corresponding side lengths are equal.

(1) We are given LP = 2, PQ = 6, MP = 3, RS = 6. Therefore, SQ = RS + RQ = RS + RP + PQ - PQ = RS + RP + PQ = 6 + 6 + 3 - 3. Also, we have SR = 6, QP = 6, PM = 3. Thus, SR/RQ is not defined. Instead, we can look at the ratios formed by the transversal line segment from H to M.
(2) We have HJ/JK = SR/RQ and JK/KL = RQ/QP and KL/LM = QP/PM. Since Line(H,S) || Line(J,R) || Line(K,Q) || Line(L,P) then HJ/JH = SR/RS, JK/KQ = RQ/QP and KL/LP = QP/PM. But SR/RQ, etc. are of no use.

We are given that LK = 4, KJ = 2, LP = 2, PQ = 6, PM = 3, SR = 6.
Let JH = x. We have SR = 6, RQ = RS+SQ, PQ= 6, MP = 3
Then JH/HJ = SR/RQ, where JH = x, so HJ/KJ = SR/RQ means x/2 = 6/RQ. RQ is not defined.
Instead HJ/LK = SR/PM. Then x/2 = 6/6 = 6/6+3 = RQ+QP+PM = RP = RQ= RP = SQ = RS.
Using similar triangles, we know that JH/SR = JK/RQ = KL/QP = LM/MP.
We are given RS=6, PQ=6, MP=3, LK=4, KJ=2. So SR,PQ,MP are on one side. And JH, JK, KL, LM are on the other side.
We have
JH/RS = JK/RQ = KL/PQ = LM/MP.
Therefore, JH/6 = 2/RQ = 4/6 = LM/3.
JH/6 = 4/6 implies JH = 4.
Since JH/RS = JK/RQ = KL/PQ = LM/MP, JH/6 = 2/RQ = 4/6 = LM/3
Then JK/RQ = KL/PQ = 4/6 = 2/3.
So 2/RQ = 2/3 which means RQ = 3.
JH/6 = 4/6 implies JH=4.
LM/MP = 4/6 implies LM/3 = 2/3, so LM = 2.

Consider JH/JK = SR/RQ. SR = 6, KJ = 2. And L P = 2, P Q = 6, M P = 3.
So J H = x and H J / J K = x / 2. SR/RQ = 6/RQ.
JH/JK = SR/RQ = LK/PQ = LM/MP, or JH/2 = 4/6 or JH/2 = LM/3 and  H J / 2 = x / 2.
KJ/KL = RQ/PQ which means RQ = PQ * JK/KL which implies RQ = 6 * 2/4 which means RQ=3. So JH /2 = 6/3 which means JH= 4
