GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
From the image, angles 1 and 3 are vertical angles.
From definition of vertical angles, vertical angles are equal.
From Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(1)),Add(Mul(4,p),15)) and Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(3)),Sub(Mul(3,p),10)), MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = 4p + 15 and MeasureOf(Angle(3)) = 3p - 10.
From vertical angles are equal, MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = MeasureOf(Angle(3)), then 4p + 15 = 3p - 10.
From 4p + 15 = 3p - 10, 4p - 3p = -10 - 15, so p = -25.
However, the measure of an angle cannot be negative, so we made an error.
Angles 3 and 4 appear supplementary.
From visual analysis, points C, D and B form a straight line. Therefore angle 2 and angle 4 are supplementary.
Also, angles 1 and 2 are supplementary. Therefore, angles 1 and 4 are equal.
Therefore, 4p + 15 = 6r + 5.
Also, angles 3 and 4 are supplementary if C, D and B are co-linear.
Then, 3p - 10 + 6r + 5 = 180
Then, 3p + 6r = 185
We are looking for the value of p.
Angles 1 and 3 are not vertical angles. Angles A1CD and B1CD are straight lines. Angles 1 and 2 are supplementary and angles 3 and 4 are supplementary.
Angle 1 = 4p + 15
Angle 3 = 3p - 10
Angle 4 = 6r + 5

However, A, 1, B, D form a quadrilateral. Angles around the quadrilateral are supplementary.
The sum of angles 1 and 3 is not 180. The points are not co-linear.
We cannot determine the relationship between p and r. However, 1 and 3 are on opposite sides of lines CD and AB.
Let's reconsider the vertical angles. 1 and angle CDB are not vertical angles.
Let's go back to 4p + 15 = 3p - 10. This is incorrect. It is not a straight line.

Instead, let's consider angles 1 and 3.
Angles 1 and 3 are supplementary to some angle, and therefore must be related in some way.
The angles formed by the intersection of two lines have relations to each other, and must be considered for solving this.

The problem might have a typo, making it impossible to solve for 'p'. Without further geometric relationships or constraints derived from the figure, the provided information is insufficient to uniquely determine the value of 'p'.

If, by chance, angles 1 and 3 were supplementary, meaning they add up to 180, then
4p + 15 + 3p - 10 = 180
7p + 5 = 180
7p = 175
p = 25
