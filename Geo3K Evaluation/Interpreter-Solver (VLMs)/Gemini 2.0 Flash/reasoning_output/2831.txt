From Secant(Line(B,D),Circle(E)) and Secant(Line(C,D),Circle(E)) + Secant-Secant Power Theorem →  $DA * DB = DC * DF$
From LengthOf(Line(B,A),15) and LengthOf(Line(A,D),x) → $DB = DA + AB = x + 15$
From LengthOf(Line(C,D),8) and LengthOf(Line(C,F),12) →  We are given that $CD = 8$. We need to find $DF$. However, the length of CF is given as 12, which is a chord. We seem to have an error here, CD = 8 and we need DF, but the problem states CE = 12 and implies CE is a radius, so the whole circle is radius = 12, so CF is a chord in that circle and we also know that point F is on line CD, so let's denote the distance from D to F as $y$. So $DF = DC + CF = 8 + 12$, which is incorrect. We must use the secant-secant theorem.

From Secant-Secant Power Theorem → $DA * DB = DC * DE$
We should be looking for DE, we know radius = CE = 12. I think there's an error in how the diagram is labelled, the length of CF is a chord and we need DF. Since point F lies on the circle, we need to identify the point where CF meets the line CD. We can write the secant length formula as $DA*DB = DC*DF$.

So, we have $x * (x + 15) = 8 * (8 + CF)$.
I believe the diagram and question is mislabeled. The length next to CD is not 8 but a combination length.

Instead of CF being the length of the whole chord, let's say DF has the length 12 which means D is outside the circle and F is another point where the line CD intersects the circle.
From Secant-Secant Power Theorem → $DA * DB = DC * DF$, where $DA = x$, $DB = x + 15$, $DC = 8$, $DF = ?$
We can consider that F is a point where the circle intersects the line segment, so if the problem intended to mean that $CF$ is an external part, $DF$, and $CD = 8$. So instead, let's assume DF = 8.
So, with this misunderstanding let us assume that CD = 8 is the line outside, if CF is the intersection, then the distance we need would be $8 * (8+?) = x * (15+x)$. If the radius of the circle is 12, we can assume CF is a part of the line through D, so let DF = $y$, thus the $DA * DB = DC * DE$. Instead $CD=8$, so we need the length of the entire length $DE$. We may be able to drop perpendicular, but need a new understanding.
Let's consider instead that $CD =8 $ and $CF = 12$. Assuming CD is just an intersection. So $x(x+15) = 8(8+12)$, $x(x+15) = 8(20)$

$x^2 + 15x = 160$
$x^2 + 15x - 160 = 0$
$x = \frac{-15 \pm \sqrt{15^2 - 4(1)(-160)}}{2}$
$x = \frac{-15 \pm \sqrt{225 + 640}}{2}$
$x = \frac{-15 \pm \sqrt{865}}{2}$
$x = \frac{-15 \pm 29.41}{2}$
$x = \frac{-15 + 29.41}{2}$ (x cannot be negative, length)
$x = \frac{14.41}{2} = 7.205 \approx 7.2$
