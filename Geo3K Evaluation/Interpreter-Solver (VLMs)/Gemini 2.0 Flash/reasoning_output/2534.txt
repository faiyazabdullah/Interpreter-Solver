From Parallel(Line(D,C),Line(E,B)) + [Corresponding Angles Theorem] → Angle(ADE) = Angle(ABE) and Angle(AED) = Angle(ABC).
From Angle(ADE) = Angle(ABE) and Angle(AED) = Angle(ABC) and Angle(DAE) = Angle(BAC) + [AA Similarity] → Triangle(A,D,E) is similar to Triangle(A,B,C).
From Similar(Triangle(A,D,E),Triangle(A,B,C)) → RatioOf(LengthOf(A,D),LengthOf(A,C)) = RatioOf(LengthOf(A,E),LengthOf(A,B)).
From Equals(LengthOf(A,D),4) and Equals(LengthOf(B,C),5) and Equals(LengthOf(A,B),Sub(x,2)) and LengthOf(A,G) = 10, we need to find the length of AC and AE.
From LengthOf(A,G) = 10 and LengthOf(A,D) = 4 → LengthOf(D,G) = 10 - 4 = 6. However, this is not needed.
From RatioOf(LengthOf(A,D),LengthOf(A,C)) = RatioOf(LengthOf(A,E),LengthOf(A,B)), we know that AD/AC = AE/AB.
From Equals(LengthOf(A,D),4) and LengthOf(B,C)=5, we can't find the length of AC.
From the image, assume E lies on AB and D lies on AC. Thus,  RatioOf(LengthOf(A,D),LengthOf(A,C)) = RatioOf(LengthOf(A,E),LengthOf(A,B)). However, we do not have the LengthOf(A,E).
Since Line(E,B) is parallel to Line(D,C), triangle ADE is similar to triangle ABC. Therefore, AD/AC = AE/AB = DE/BC.
Since AD = 4 and BC = 5, we have 4/AC = AE/(x-2) = DE/5.
From similar triangles, we also have AD/AC = AB-EB/AB. Then 4/AC = (x-2)/AC.
Since we cannot find the relation between AE and AB.
From the image, it looks like AG and AD are on the same line and equal to 10. This cannot be right.
Let's assume that AE/AB = AD/AC. Also let AE = y and AC = z. Then y/(x-2) = 4/z. We have z = 4(x-2)/y. We know that AC = AD + DC.
From similar triangles ADE and ABC, AD/AC = AB/AE = DE/BC. Thus AD/AC = 4/(4+5) = 4/9.
Then AD/AC = 4/AC = AB/AC. Then AB/(AB+5).  So 4/(4+5) = (x-2)/(x-2+5) = (x-2)/(x+3).  4/9 = (x-2)/(x+3). 4(x+3) = 9(x-2). 4x+12 = 9x-18. 5x = 30. x = 6.
Another assumption: if AE/AB = AD/AC, then AE/(x-2) = 4/(4+5) = 4/9. 9AE = 4x-8. AE = (4x-8)/9. Then AE/AB = (4x-8)/9/(x-2) = 4/9.
If AD/AC = AE/AB = DE/BC. AD=4, BC=5, AB=x-2.
So 4/AC = AE/(x-2) = DE/5. Since DE is unknown, we will not get any values. Since E B \parallel D C.
We know AB/AC = AE/AD. AB/(AB+5) = AD/AE. Let AB/(BC+AB) = 4/(4+BC), so (x-2)/((x-2)+5) = AE/4. Thus we need to find AC.

AD/AC = AB/AE. So 4/AC = (x-2)/(unknown). AB = x-2. We need another approach.
DE/BC = AD/AC.  so we have 4/9 = AE/(x-2), but this equation doesn't help much.

Considering AD/AC = AE/AB. and AC = AD+DC = 4+DC. We need find x from x-2 = AB.  Since DC is unknown, we assume AE = 4 and AB = x-2.
4/AC = AE/(x-2). But still AC is unknown. However, AE = 4 is not a correct since AE < AB. 4/AC = AE/(x-2).
If AB/AC = AD/AE, and AB=x-2, BC=5, AD=4. 4/(4+5) = (4/(x-2))
So AD/AC = AB/AE. If AE is not given, we cannot solve the problem. Let AC = x.
