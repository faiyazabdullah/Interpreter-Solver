From PointLiesOnLine(K,Line(D,J)) + IsMedianOf(Line(D,J),Triangle(C,D,F)) + IsCentroidOf(K,Triangle(C,D,F)) → DK is part of a median of \triangle C D F, and K is the centroid.
From IsCentroidOf(K,Triangle(C,D,F)) → Centroids divide each median in a 2:1 ratio, with the longer segment being from the vertex to the centroid.
From DK = 16 → DK is the longer segment.
From DK = 16 + 2:1 ratio → KJ = DK / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8.
From DK = 16 + KJ = 8 → DJ = DK + KJ = 16 + 8 = 24.
From IsMedianOf(Line(D,J),Triangle(C,D,F)) → J is the midpoint of CF.
From G is the midpoint of CD + J is the midpoint of DF → GJ is a midsegment of \triangle C D F.
From GJ is a midsegment → GJ = CF / 2
From H is midpoint of CF → FH = HC = CF / 2 = 12.  Therefore, CF = 2 * 12 = 24.
From G is midpoint of CD + J is midpoint of DF → GJ = CD / 2
From DK = 16 and centroid divides median in 2:1 ratio → The centroid K divides DJ into two segments such that DK:KJ = 2:1. Therefore DK = (2/3)DJ.
From PointLiesOnLine(K,Line(C,G)) + IsCentroidOf(K,Triangle(C,D,F)) + IsMedianOf(Line(C,G),Triangle(C,D,F)) → CK is part of a median of \triangle C D F, and K is the centroid.
Let's call the median from D to J: DJ. DK = (2/3) * DJ. 16 = (2/3) * DJ. DJ = 16 * (3/2) = 24
We also know that J is the midpoint of DF. Let's call the median from C to G: CG. CK = (2/3) * CG
From G is midpoint of CD, J is midpoint of DF, H is midpoint of CF → GJ is parallel to CF, JH is parallel to CD, and GH is parallel to DF. GJ = CF / 2; JH = CD / 2; GH = DF / 2
In \triangle C D F, G is the midpoint of CD, J is the midpoint of DF → GJ is a midsegment of \triangle CDF. GJ is parallel to CF, and GJ = (1/2) * CF
Since GJ || CF, \triangle DGJ ~ \triangle DCF. Therefore, DG / DC = DJ / DF = GJ / CF = 1/2
From G is the midpoint of CD → DG = CG = CD / 2.

The problem asks for CD.
Since G is the midpoint of CD, then CG = GD. Also, DG = 9 is incorrect.  Since we know that DK = 16, then DJ = 24.

Given the median from C to the midpoint of DF, which is J. Also the median from D to the midpoint of CF which is H. Let G be the midpoint of CD. CD = 2 * CG. CD = 2 * 9 = 18
