From Right(Triangle(A,B,C)) + LengthOf(A,C) = 5 → Triangle ABC is a right triangle with hypotenuse 5.
From RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)) → Angle ABC is 90 degrees.
From RightAngle(Angle(A,B,D)) → Angle ABD is 90 degrees.
From Isosceles(Triangle(A,B,D)) + Equals(LengthOf(A,B),LengthOf(B,D)) → Triangle ABD is an isosceles right triangle, so LengthOf(A,B) = LengthOf(B,D) = y.
From MeasureOf(Angle(D)) = 45 → Angle D = 45 degrees.
In triangle ABD, since angle ABD = 90 and angle D = 45, then angle DAB = 180 - 90 - 45 = 45.
Since angle D = angle DAB, triangle ABD is isosceles, so AB = BD = y.
In right triangle ABC, by the Pythagorean theorem, we have AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2.
So y^2 + BC^2 = 5^2 = 25.
We need to find y. We can use trig functions in triangle ABC:
sin(C) = AB/AC = y/5
cos(C) = BC/AC = BC/5
Also in triangle ABC, we don't know angle C.
However, we have isosceles right triangle ABD, so AB = BD = y.
Since BD = y, and BC + BD = x, then BC = x - y.
Substituting into the Pythagorean theorem, we have y^2 + (x-y)^2 = 25.
y^2 + x^2 - 2xy + y^2 = 25.
2y^2 + x^2 - 2xy = 25. This doesn't help.

Let's look at just the right triangle ABC:
sin(C) = y/5
cos(C) = BC/5
Also, we can relate y and BC if we can find the angle C.
We can't assume that ABC is a 45-45-90 triangle.

Consider using trigonometry on triangle ABC. We know AC = 5 and AB = y.
sin(C) = opposite/hypotenuse = y/5
cos(C) = adjacent/hypotenuse = BC/5
We also know that x = BD + BC = y + BC
So BC = x - y
Then cos(C) = (x-y)/5

Since Triangle ABD is an isosceles right triangle, BD = AB = y.
Using trig on triangle ABC,
AB = AC * sin(C) = 5 * sin(C) = y
BC = AC * cos(C) = 5 * cos(C)
x = BD + BC = y + BC
x = 5 * sin(C) + 5 * cos(C)

We want to solve for y = 5 * sin(C)

Let's see if we can make use of any special angle properties. No.

y^2 + BC^2 = 25.  Also BD = y. And x = BD + BC = y + BC.
BC = x-y, so y^2 + (x-y)^2 = 25.
y^2 + x^2 - 2xy + y^2 = 25
2y^2 - 2xy + x^2 = 25

Since we don't know x, this is unlikely to help.

The answer is going to be of the form $\frac{5\sqrt{k}}{2}$ since we have a square root in the options.

If y = $\frac{5\sqrt{2}}{2}$, then $y^2 = \frac{50}{4} = \frac{25}{2} = 12.5$
BC^2 = 25 - 12.5 = 12.5, so BC = $\frac{5\sqrt{2}}{2}$, thus AB = BC. Then angle C = 45 degrees.
