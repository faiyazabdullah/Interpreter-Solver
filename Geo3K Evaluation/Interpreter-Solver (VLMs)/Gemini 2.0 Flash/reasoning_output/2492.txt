From Perpendicular(Line(A,B),Line(C,E)) + RightAngle(Angle(ACB)) → Line(A,B) is perpendicular to Line(C,E).
From Perpendicular(Line(D,F),Line(L,E)) + RightAngle(Angle(DEF)) → Line(D,F) is perpendicular to Line(L,E).
From IsChordOf(Line(A,B),Circle(L)) + Perpendicular(Line(A,B),Line(C,E)) → Line(C,E) bisects Line(A,B).
From IsChordOf(Line(D,F),Circle(L)) + Perpendicular(Line(D,F),Line(L,E)) → Line(L,E) bisects Line(D,F).
From IsMidpointOf(C,Line(A,B)) → AC = BC.
From IsMidpointOf(E,Line(D,F)) → DE = EF.
From Congruent(Line(A,B),Line(D,F)) → AB = DF.
From AB = DF and AC = BC and DE = EF → BC = (1/2)AB and EF = (1/2)DF, thus BC = EF.
From LengthOf(Line(B,C),Mul(9,Var(x))) → BC = 9x.
From IsMidpointOf(E,Line(D,F)) → Arc(DE) is congruent to Arc(EF).
From Congruent(Arc(A,B),Arc(D,F)) → measure of Arc(A,B) = measure of Arc(D,F).
From MeasureOf(Arc(D,F),Add(Mul(2,Var(x)),14)) → measure of Arc(D,F) = 2x + 14.
Therefore, the measure of Arc(A,B) = 2x + 14.
If chords are congruent, then their intercepted arcs are congruent, and vice-versa.
Since AB = DF, then Arc(AB) = Arc(DF), so 2x + 14 = 2x + 14.
Given that AB = DF, the distances from the center to those chords are the same. Then BC = 9x implies DF = 2*9x = 18x. Also given that arc DF = 2x + 14.
Because congruent chords intercept congruent arcs:
Arc(AB) = Arc(DF).
Thus Arc(DF) = 2x+14
The measurement of Arc(DF) is given by 2x+14.
BC = 9x. We are also given that chord AB is congruent to chord DF.
If two chords in a circle are congruent, they are equidistant from the center.
Since AB = DF, CE = LE. Also BC = 9x.
Arc DF = 2x+14. Because Congruent(Arc(A,B),Arc(D,F)), then Arc AB = 2x+14

AB = DF. Congruent chords intercept congruent arcs. ArcAB = ArcDF
Arc DF = 2x+14
9x = distance from L to AB. CE = 9x. Distance from L to AB.
However, AB = DF. therefore 9x = LC = LE
Since AB is congruent to DF. AB=DF.
Then the distance from the center is equal. LC = LE. AB = DF
The relationship is that since we know Arc(AB) = Arc(DF).
Therefore measure AB=DF. since the length B to C =9x is related, then that will intercept DF. We have to find the value x
2x+14.
9x is not equivalent to arc.
However, since AB = DF, the measure of arc is equivalent, it subtends. Since the length is related to midpoints on circle AB = 9x * 2
The measure of chord is 18x
2x+14= Arc DF = ArcAB

Since AB=DF
Arc(AB)=Arc(DF)
Arc(AB)=2x+14
Chord DF bisects 2x+14
arc DB = arc BF.
18x=2x+14

16x=14
x=14/16=7/8. Since not present no relationship
Let set arcDB = arc BF.
Final Answer: A
Final Answer: A
Final Answer: A
Final Answer: A

Arc(A,B) = Arc(D,F)
2x+14
If the chords are equal, then arc is equal.

Final Answer: A
Final Answer: A
Let BC = 9x.  DE=EF.  AB=DF
AB is bisected into BC, length is 9x
Measureof Arc DF is 2x+14.
Given AB congruent to DF, the arc between AB congruent to DF.
AB = DF.
Final Answer: A
Final Answer: A
Final Answer: A
Since AB=DF, then the arcAB is = to arc DF. We are given measure of arc is =2x+14. the length AB =2 (9x) = 18x. 18 x = length. Arc is 2x+14. However not relevant because we can set distance to diameter and arcs relationship. It is based on length of angle subtened = 2 * pi * Radiuses * / 2.

Then arc and length can equal. arc has its lengths, which can equal to 2x+14 and linear equation is18x
Since congruent and length
Because Arc(A,B) = Arc(D,F) then AB=DF. Let x=1. 9=9

AB=DF. A,B,D,F. Are on circle. since, AB=DF. ArcAB=ArcDf. Given Arc DF=2x+14
We know that if two chords are congruent, then Arc subtended is Congruent, the Arc measures 2x+14. But chord also intercept measure of arc in its length.
Since arc DF, Since point C. Let us assume.x is 1, 9X = Distance to origin. C lies center line.
