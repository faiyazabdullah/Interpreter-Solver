From PointLiesOnLine(E,l) + PointLiesOnLine(B,l) → Line l passes through points E and B.
From PointLiesOnLine(A,m) + PointLiesOnLine(F,m) → Line m passes through points A and F.
From PointLiesOnLine(N,n) + PointLiesOnLine(G,n) → Line n passes through points N and G.
From IntersectAt(l,n,Line(E,B),Point(C)) → lines l and n intersect at point C.
From IntersectAt(m,n,Line(A,F),Point(C)) → lines m and n intersect at point C.
Angle 1 and angle 2 are a linear pair. From linear pair theorem, angles 1 and 2 are supplementary.
Angle 1 and angle 4 are vertical angles. From vertical angles theorem, angles 1 and 4 are congruent.
Angle 2 and angle 3 are vertical angles. From vertical angles theorem, angles 2 and 3 are congruent.
From Parallel(l,m) → angles 1 and 5 are corresponding angles. Since corresponding angles are congruent when lines are parallel, angles 1 and 5 are congruent.
From Parallel(l,m) → angles 4 and 8 are corresponding angles. Since corresponding angles are congruent when lines are parallel, angles 4 and 8 are congruent.
Since angle 1 and angle 5 are congruent, and angle 4 and angle 8 are congruent, and angles 1 and 4 are congruent, then angles 1, 4, 5 and 8 are congruent.
Angle 5 and angle 6 are a linear pair. From linear pair theorem, angles 5 and 6 are supplementary.
Since angles 1 and 5 are congruent, and angles 5 and 6 are supplementary, then angles 1 and 6 are supplementary.
Angle 7 and angle 5 are vertical angles. From vertical angles theorem, angles 5 and 7 are congruent.
Since angles 5 and 7 are congruent, and angles 1 and 5 are congruent, then angles 1 and 7 are congruent.
Angle 6 and angle 8 are vertical angles. From vertical angles theorem, angles 6 and 8 are congruent.
Angle 5 and angle 8 are same-side interior angles. From same-side interior angles theorem, angles 5 and 8 are supplementary.
Angle 1 and angle 8 are corresponding angles. From corresponding angles theorem, angles 1 and 8 are congruent.
Since angles 1 and 6 are supplementary, and angles 6 and 8 are congruent, then angles 1 and 8 are supplementary.
Angles that are supplementary to angle 1 are angles 2 and 6.
Since angles 2 and 3 are vertical angles, and angles 1 and 2 are supplementary, angles 1 and 3 are supplementary.
Since angles 6 and 7 are vertical angles, and angles 1 and 6 are supplementary, angles 1 and 7 are supplementary.
Thus, angles 2, 3, 6, and 7 are supplementary to angle 1.
