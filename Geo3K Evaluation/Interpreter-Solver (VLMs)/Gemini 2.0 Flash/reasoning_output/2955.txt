QUESTION:
\angle 6 and \angle 8 are complementary, m \angle 8 = 47. Find the measure of \angle 7.

A. 43
B. 47
C. 86
D. 90

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):

From Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(6)),MeasureOf(Angle(8))),90) and Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(8)),47) → MeasureOf(Angle(6)) + 47 = 90
From MeasureOf(Angle(6)) + 47 = 90 → MeasureOf(Angle(6)) = 90 - 47 = 43
The problem asks to find the measure of angle 7. The information provided is the measure of angle 8 and that angle 6 and angle 8 are complementary. There is no relationship given between angle 7 and either angle 6 or angle 8. The measure of angle 7 can not be determined from the provided information. However, we are told that angle 6 and angle 8 are complementary and we are asked to find the measure of angle 7. The sum of angles 6 and 8 is 90. The measure of angle 8 is 47. Therefore, the measure of angle 6 is 90-47=43. Since the only numbers given in the diagram are 6, 7, and 8, it must be assumed that the measures of the angles are indicated by those numbers. Then \angle 6 = 43 and this is not equal to \angle 7. There is no relationship to find m \angle 7. There must be a mistake in the problem statement. The question asks to find the measure of angle 7. The numbers on the diagram indicate that lengths of the sides are shown. Angles are conventionally labeled with arcs. The answer is 43, which would be the measure of \angle 6.
