From IntersectAt(Line(R,U),Line(S,T),Line(R,F),Point(F)) + IntersectAt(Line(R,U),Line(S,T),Line(S,F),Point(F)) → Line(R,U) and Line(S,T) intersect at point F.
From Angle(R,F,T) + Vertical Angle Theorem → Angle(R,F,U) is vertical to angle(S,F,T) and congruent to it.
From Angle(R,F,U) + Congruent(Angle(4),Angle(R,F,U)) → Angle(4) is congruent to angle(R,F,U).
From PointLiesOnCircle(R,1) + PointLiesOnCircle(U,1) + PointLiesOnCircle(S,1) + PointLiesOnCircle(T,1) + Circle(1) → R, U, S, and T lie on circle 1.
From MeasureOf(Angle(R,U,S))=92 and MeasureOf(Angle(R,T,S))=51 + intersecting secants theorem → MeasureOf(Angle(R,F,S)) = abs(MeasureOf(Arc(RS)) - MeasureOf(Arc(UT)))/2
From MeasureOf(Angle(R,U,S)) = 92 + Inscribed Angle Theorem → MeasureOf(Arc(RS)) = 2 * 92 = 184
From MeasureOf(Angle(R,T,S)) = 51 + Inscribed Angle Theorem → MeasureOf(Arc(RS)) is subtended by angle RTS, and MeasureOf(Arc(SR)) = 2*51 = 102
Since RS is 184 and SR is 102, we have conflicting information. The Inscribed Angle Theorem applies to angles formed by points on the circumference of a circle. However, angles RUS and RTS are formed by intersecting secants, so it doesn't apply here.

We can use the theorem that the measure of an angle formed by two intersecting lines is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. Therefore, the measure of angle 4 (or angle RFS) equals 1/2 (arc(RU) + arc(ST)).
The measure of angle RUS is 92 degrees, which means the measure of arc RTS = 2 * 92 = 184 degrees.
The measure of angle RTS is 51 degrees, which means the measure of arc RUS = 2 * 51 = 102 degrees.
The measure of angle RFS = 1/2 (arc(RU) + arc(ST)). arc(RU) = 102. To find arc(ST) we use the fact that arc(RTS) = arc(RS) + arc(ST) = 184. Therefore, arc(ST) = 184 - arc(RS)
We also have RUS = arc(RU) = arc(RS) + arc(SU). 102 = arc(RS) + arc(SU).
We need an alternative approach. Consider the angles formed at F. Angle RFS + SFT = 180 and Angle RFT + UFS = 180. Angle RFU = Angle SFT.
m<RFS = (m<RUS + m<RTS)/2 = (92+51)/2 = 143/2 = 71.5 degrees.
