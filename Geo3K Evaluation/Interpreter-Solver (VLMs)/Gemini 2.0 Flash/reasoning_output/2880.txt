From MeasureOf(Angle(M,P,L)) = 65 + Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(M,P,L)),65) → m \angle MPL = 65
From Perpendicular(Line(N,P),Line(P,L)) + RightAngle(Angle(N,P,L)) + Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(N,P,L)),90) → m \angle NPL = 90
From Circle(P) → P is the center of the circle
From PointLiesOnCircle(N,Circle(P)) + PointLiesOnCircle(J,Circle(P)) + PointLiesOnCircle(K,Circle(P)) → NJ, JK are arcs on circle P
The measure of an arc is equal to the measure of its central angle. So we need to find m \angle NPK.
m \angle NPK = 360 - m \angle NPL - m \angle MPL - m \angle MPK
m \angle MPK = 360 - m \angle NPL - m \angle MPL - m \angle JPK = 360 - 90 - 65 - m\angle NPK - m \angle JPK
We need to find m \angle NPK = m \angle NPJ + m \angle JPK

We are given m \angle MPL = 65 and m \angle NPL = 90.
Since the total degrees in a circle is 360, m \angle NPK + m \angle KPL + m \angle JPK + m \angle JPL + m \angle NPM + m \angle MPL = 360
We seek the measure of arc NJK, which is equal to m \angle NPK = m \angle NPJ + m \angle JPK.

Since we don't have enough information to determine m \angle NPK = m \angle NPJ + m \angle JPK precisely, we must consider any possible interpretations. It is possible there is typo, and NJK refers to major arc rather than minor arc. If that is the case, then NJK refers to major arc. If not, we seek minor arc. It is also possible that N, J, K are collinear.

The prompt is flawed and does not provide enough information. However, it is likely looking for m \angle NPK. m \angle NPL = 90. Thus we seek m \angle LPK = 360 - 90 = 270. Since m \angle MPL = 65. m \angle KPM = x. then m \angle NPK = m \angle NPJ + m \angle JPK = ?

We have m \angle MPL = 65 and m \angle NPL = 90.  We want m \widehat{NJK} which equals m \angle NPK.
m \angle NPK = 360 - (m \angle NPL + m \angle LPK)
Given m \angle MPL = 65. We can not solve for m \angle NPK = m \angle NPJ + m \angle JPK
However, the options are simple so we can guess.

m \angle NPL = 90
m \angle MPL = 65
so arc NM has 65 degrees. arc NL is 90 degree
Since N P \perp P L. m \angle NPL = 90. Therefore m \widehat {NL} = 90
If we are finding arc NJK, or m \angle NJK.
If m \widehat {NJK} is the difference between \widehat {NL} and arc \widehat{KL} then is could be that m \widehat {NL} - m \widehat{KL}.

We are looking for the arc NJK. Let's consider the case when arc NK passes through J.
arc NK passes through J when the points NJK are on the same arc.

Assume m \angle LPK = 25.  m \angle NPK = m \angle NPL + m \angle LPK = 90 + 25 = 115.

Since the options are 25, 75, 90, 155, let us check how we can get 155. m \angle NPJ + m \angle JPK = 155. Since angle NPL is 90, and MPL is 65, then m \angle JPK could be 155 by a mistake. Then the question mark for the points could be replaced by JL. If this is correct, then let's calculate. This is unlikely.

Let us look at 25. If that is case, m NPK = m NJ + m JK = 25.

I am unable to calculate it without additional information. However, let's assume N, L, K are 3 of the vertices of a square centered on P. Also J is on the other quarter. If so, NPK might just equal 90, which means that K overlaps L?  Also if LPK is equal to say..75. Then NPK could be 155.
Thus the only viable options are B and C. If NPK = 90 is not enough, let's try m \angle KPL = 90.
