From IsMidpointOf(A,Line(W,Y)) + LengthOf(Line(W,A),10) → LengthOf(Line(A,Y)) = LengthOf(Line(W,A)) = 10
But LengthOf(Line(Y,A),2) is given in the image, so there is an inconsistency in the problem setup. Let us assume LengthOf(Line(Y,A),2) is wrong and LengthOf(Line(A,Y)) = LengthOf(Line(W,A)) = 10 is correct.
From IsMidpointOf(A,Line(X,Z)) → LengthOf(Line(X,A)) = LengthOf(Line(A,Z))
From LengthOf(Line(X,A),Sub(a,7)) and LengthOf(Line(Z,A),Sub(Mul(2,b),6)) → a - 7 = 2b - 6
However, since the value of 'b' is not given, and we need to find 'a', let's assume the problem intended for WY and XZ to be congruent diagonals of the parallelogram.
Since A is the midpoint of WY, WA = AY.
Since A is the midpoint of XZ, XA = AZ.
Also, WA = 10. So, AY should also be 10.
Given XA = a - 7 and AZ = 2b - 6. Also XA = AZ.
So a - 7 = 2b - 6
This doesn't help us to find a.
Now, we are given that WY = WA + AY = 10 + 10 = 20 and YA is given as 2. Therefore, we must take WA = AY which would make it incorrect.
Since A is the midpoint of WY, WA = AY. But WA = 10 and AY = 2.
The question should say the value of AY = 10.
From Equals(LengthOf(Line(X,A)),LengthOf(Line(A,Z))) → LengthOf(Line(X,A)) = LengthOf(Line(A,Z))
From LengthOf(Line(X,A),Sub(a,7)) and LengthOf(Line(Z,A),Sub(Mul(2,b),6)) → a - 7 = 2b - 6.
Since opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal, assume that the problem has a typo and WY = XZ. In that case, WA + AY = XA + AZ and since WA = AY and XA = AZ, 2WA = 2XA or WA = XA.
WA = 10 and XA = a - 7, so 10 = a - 7 or a = 17. But 17 is not a choice.
Since WY and XZ are diagonals of a parallelogram, and the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.
WA = AY = 10 and XA = AZ
XA = a - 7
AZ = 2b - 6
a - 7 = 2b - 6
a - 7 = AZ
Let AY = 2 = WA = 10 which is incorrect in the drawing.
Consider WA = AY or 10 = 2 which is incorrect in the drawing.
Consider XA = AZ or a - 7 = AZ

The question says to find the value of 'a' in the given parallelogram.

If the question means WA = 10 and AY = 10, and XA = AZ then XA = a - 7 and AZ = a - 7. Therefore the value of a can take any value depending on b.
In parallelogram WXYZ, the midpoint A divides WY such that WA = AY.
Given WA = 10. Therefore AY = 10.
XA = AZ. XA = a - 7.
The question does not provide sufficient information.
Let's assume that WA = XA. Then, 10 = a - 7 and therefore a = 17.
However, the choices given for 'a' are 2, 8, 9, 10.
If XA = 8, then a - 7 = 8. Then a = 15.
If XA = 9, then a - 7 = 9. Then a = 16.
If XA = 10, then a - 7 = 10. Then a = 17.

Since A is the midpoint of XZ, XA = AZ. Then a - 7 = AZ. The choices are 2, 8, 9, 10.
If a = 2, 2 - 7 = AZ which is not possible.
If a = 8, 8 - 7 = 1 = AZ.
If a = 9, 9 - 7 = 2 = AZ.
If a = 10, 10 - 7 = 3 = AZ.
Since we have WA = 10 and AY = 2 (a mistake).
Then we have that WA = AY, if the original image is incorrect. So 10 = XA then, a-7 = something.
Let XA = AY then a - 7 = 2. Then a = 9.
Since A is the midpoint of line XZ, this means XA = AZ. Therefore, a - 7 = AZ. The only length values provided are 10 and 2.
From WA = AY = 10, if we consider XA = AY, then a - 7 = 10 and therefore, a = 17.
If we assume there is a mistake, and the distance AY = 8, then XA = 8, and a - 7 = 8, which means a = 15.

Let XA = 2, so a - 7 = 2. a = 9.
If it is a parallelogram and diagonals bisect each other, then we need to determine what is XA or AZ. However, what the diagram seems to suggest is that diagonals bisect each other so A is midpoint. We also need that the intersection bisects the diagonal segments, and WA = AY.
We can consider that AY = XA, therefore 2 = a - 7, so a = 9
