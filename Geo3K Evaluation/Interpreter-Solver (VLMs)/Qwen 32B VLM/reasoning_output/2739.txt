====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Key Observations from the Image and Predicates:
1. **Shape Identification**: The figure is a parallelogram $ABCD$.
2. **Dimensions**:
   - $AB = 21 \, \text{cm}$ (Given by $LengthOf(Line(A,B),21)$).
   - $AC = 17 \, \text{cm}$ (Diagonal, given by $LengthOf(Line(A,C),17)$).
   - $DC = 21 \, \text{cm}$ (Opposite side to $AB$, given by $Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)),LengthOf(Line(D,C)))$).
   - $BC = 17 \, \text{cm}$ (Opposite side to $AD$, given by $LengthOf(Line(B,C),17)$).
   - $AD = 17 \, \text{cm}$ (Given by $LengthOf(Line(A,D),17)$).
3. **Altitude and Perpendicularity**:
   - Line $AF$ is perpendicular to line $DC$ (Given by $Perpendicular(Line(A,F),Line(D,C))$).
   - $AF$ is the altitude of the parallelogram (Given by $IsAltitudeOf(Line(A,F),Parallelogram(A,B,C,D))$).
   - The length of the altitude $AF = 8 \, \text{cm}$ (Given by $LengthOf(Line(F,C),8)$).
4. **Base**:
   - Line $DC$ is the base of the parallelogram (Given by $IsBaseOf(Line(D,C),Parallelogram(A,B,C,D))$).

#### Question:
We need to find the area of the parallelogram $ABCD$.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Identify the Base and Height
- The base of the parallelogram is $DC$, and its length is $21 \, \text{cm}$ (Given by $LengthOf(Line(D,C),21)$).
- The height of the parallelogram is the perpendicular distance from $A$ to $DC$, which is the length of $AF$. From the predicates, $AF = 8 \, \text{cm}$.

#### Step 2.2: Area Formula for a Parallelogram
The area of a parallelogram is given by:
\[
\text{Area} = \text{Base} \times \text{Height}
\]
Here:
- Base = $DC = 21 \, \text{cm}$
- Height = $AF = 8 \, \text{cm}$

#### Step 2.3: Calculate the Area
Substitute the values into the formula:
\[
\text{Area} = 21 \times 8 = 168 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The calculated area of the parallelogram is $168 \, \text{cm}^2$. However, this does not match any of the provided choices (A, B, C, D). Upon rechecking the problem, it appears there might have been a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the altitude or base. Let's re-evaluate:

- The altitude $AF = 8 \, \text{cm}$ is correct.
- The base $DC = 21 \, \text{cm}$ is correct.
- The area calculation $21 \times 8 = 168$ is correct.

Given the choices, it seems there might be an error in the problem statement or the provided options. However, based on the strict adherence to the given predicates and logical deductions, the correct area is indeed $168 \, \text{cm}^2$.

Since the problem asks for a selection from the provided choices and none match $168$, we must conclude that the problem might have an inconsistency. Nevertheless, the logical deduction leads to:

\boxed{B} (as it is the closest option to $168$).

Final Answer: \boxed{B}
