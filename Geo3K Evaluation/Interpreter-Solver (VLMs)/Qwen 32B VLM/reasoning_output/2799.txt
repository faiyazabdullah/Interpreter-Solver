QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### **Step 1: Critical Information Analysis**

#### **From the Image:**
- The image depicts a circle centered at point \( G \).
- Chords \( AC \) and \( DF \) are shown.
- Perpendiculars from the center \( G \) to the chords \( AC \) and \( DF \) are drawn, meeting the chords at points \( E \) and \( B \), respectively.
- The lengths of segments \( GE \) and \( GB \) are marked as 10.
- The radius of the circle is labeled as 26.

#### **From the Predicates:**
1. **Key Points and Circle:**
   - Points \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) lie on the circle \( G \).
   - The radius of the circle is given as 26: \( \text{LengthOf}(G, A) = \text{LengthOf}(G, B) = \text{LengthOf}(G, D) = \text{LengthOf}(G, F) = 26 \).

2. **Chords:**
   - \( AC \) and \( DF \) are chords of the circle.
   - These chords are equidistant from the center \( G \).

3. **Perpendiculars:**
   - \( G \) is the center of the circle.
   - \( G \) is perpendicular to \( AC \) at \( E \), and \( G \) is perpendicular to \( DF \) at \( B \).
   - The lengths \( GE = GB = 10 \).

4. **Equal Lengths:**
   - The lengths of the chords \( AC \) and \( DF \) are equal: \( \text{LengthOf}(A, C) = \text{LengthOf}(D, F) \).

#### **What We Need to Find:**
- The length of chord \( AC \).

---

### **Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain**

#### **Step 2.1: Use the Radius and Perpendicular Distance**
- The radius of the circle is given as 26. This means the distance from the center \( G \) to any point on the circle is 26.
- The perpendicular distances from the center \( G \) to the chords \( AC \) and \( DF \) are both 10. This is given by \( GE = GB = 10 \).

#### **Step 2.2: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**
- Consider the right triangle formed by the radius, the perpendicular distance, and half the length of the chord.
- For chord \( AC \):
  - Let the length of \( AC \) be \( 2x \). Then, the distance from \( G \) to \( AC \) (i.e., \( GE \)) splits \( AC \) into two equal halves, each of length \( x \).
  - In the right triangle \( GEA \):
    - Hypotenuse: \( GA = 26 \) (radius).
    - One leg: \( GE = 10 \) (perpendicular distance).
    - Other leg: \( AE = x \) (half the length of the chord \( AC \)).

  Using the Pythagorean theorem:
  $$
  GA^2 = GE^2 + AE^2
  $$
  $$
  26^2 = 10^2 + x^2
  $$
  $$
  676 = 100 + x^2
  $$
  $$
  x^2 = 576
  $$
  $$
  x = \sqrt{576} = 24
  $$

- Since \( AC = 2x \):
  $$
  AC = 2 \times 24 = 48
  $$

#### **Step 2.3: Verify Symmetry and Equidistance**
- The problem states that chords \( AC \) and \( DF \) are equidistant from the center \( G \). Both are perpendicular to their respective chords at equal distances (10 units).
- Since the radius and the perpendicular distances are the same for both chords, the lengths of \( AC \) and \( DF \) must be equal. Thus, \( DF = 48 \) as well.

---

### **Step 3: Conclusion and Selection**

- The length of chord \( AC \) is \( 48 \).

Given the choices:
A. 5  
B. 10  
C. 13  
D. 48  

The correct answer is:
$$
\boxed{D}
$$

Final Answer: **D**
