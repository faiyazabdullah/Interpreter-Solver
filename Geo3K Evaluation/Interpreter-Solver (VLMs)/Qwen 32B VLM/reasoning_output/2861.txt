QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### **Step 1: Critical Information Analysis**

#### **Key Observations from the Image and Predicates:**
1. **Lines and Their Relationships:**
   - Line \( l \) is parallel to line \( m \): \( l \parallel m \).
   - Line \( n \) intersects both lines \( l \) and \( m \).

2. **Points of Intersection:**
   - Line \( l \) and line \( n \) intersect at point \( C \).
   - Line \( m \) and line \( n \) intersect at point \( C \).

3. **Angles Formed:**
   - Angles are labeled as \( \angle 1, \angle 2, \angle 3, \angle 4, \angle 5, \angle 6, \angle 7, \angle 8 \).
   - These angles are formed by the intersection of lines \( l \), \( m \), and \( n \).

4. **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
   - When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal, alternate interior angles are equal, and consecutive interior angles are supplementary.
   - Supplementary angles add up to \( 180^\circ \).

#### **Specific Goal:**
We need to determine which angles are supplementary to \( \angle 1 \). This requires identifying angles that sum to \( 180^\circ \) with \( \angle 1 \).

---

### **Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain**

#### **Step 2.1: Identify \( \angle 1 \)'s Position**
From the image:
- \( \angle 1 \) is formed between line \( l \) and line \( n \) on the upper left side of point \( C \).

#### **Step 2.2: Use Parallel Line Properties**
Since \( l \parallel m \) and \( n \) is a transversal:
1. **Corresponding Angles:** Angles in the same relative position on the transversal are equal.
   - \( \angle 1 \) corresponds to \( \angle 5 \). Therefore, \( \angle 1 = \angle 5 \).

2. **Alternate Interior Angles:** Angles on opposite sides of the transversal but inside the parallel lines are equal.
   - \( \angle 3 \) is an alternate interior angle to \( \angle 5 \). Therefore, \( \angle 3 = \angle 5 \).

3. **Consecutive Interior Angles:** Angles on the same side of the transversal and inside the parallel lines are supplementary.
   - \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 2 \) are consecutive interior angles. Therefore, \( \angle 1 + \angle 2 = 180^\circ \).
   - Similarly, \( \angle 5 \) and \( \angle 6 \) are consecutive interior angles. Since \( \angle 1 = \angle 5 \), it follows that \( \angle 1 + \angle 6 = 180^\circ \).

#### **Step 2.3: Identify All Angles Supplementary to \( \angle 1 \)**
From the above properties:
- \( \angle 1 + \angle 2 = 180^\circ \) (consecutive interior angles).
- \( \angle 1 + \angle 6 = 180^\circ \) (consecutive interior angles).

Additionally, since \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 3 \) are vertically opposite angles (formed by the intersection of lines \( l \) and \( n \)):
- \( \angle 1 = \angle 3 \). However, vertical angles are not supplementary; they are equal.

Finally, consider the angles around point \( C \):
- \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 7 \) are supplementary because they form a linear pair on line \( n \).
- Similarly, \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 8 \) are not directly related by parallel line properties but are part of the overall geometry.

#### **Step 2.4: Compile the List of Supplementary Angles**
The angles supplementary to \( \angle 1 \) are:
- \( \angle 2 \) (consecutive interior angle).
- \( \angle 6 \) (consecutive interior angle).
- \( \angle 7 \) (linear pair).

However, \( \angle 3 \) is not supplementary to \( \angle 1 \) because they are vertically opposite angles, and \( \angle 4 \) is not relevant to the parallel line properties involving \( \angle 1 \).
