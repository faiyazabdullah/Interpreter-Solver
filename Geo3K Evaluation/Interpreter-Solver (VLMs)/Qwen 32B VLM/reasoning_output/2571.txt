QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Deductive Solution:

#### **Step 1: Critical Information Analysis**
From the image and given predicates, we observe the following:
1. **Points on the Circle**: Points \( E \), \( H \), \( F \), and \( G \) lie on Circle(1).
2. **Lines and Intersection**: Lines \( EH \) and \( FG \) intersect at point \( J \).
3. **Arcs**: Arcs \( EF \) and \( HG \) are shown.
4. **Measurements of Arcs**:
   - Measure of Arc \( EF \): \( 8x + 6 \)
   - Measure of Arc \( HG \): \( 10x - 4 \)

The problem asks us to find the value of \( x \).

#### **Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain**

##### **Inference 1: Total Circumference of the Circle**
- Since \( E \), \( H \), \( F \), and \( G \) are points on the same circle, the total circumference of the circle is divided into arcs by these points.
- The sum of the measures of all arcs in a circle is \( 360^\circ \). Therefore:
  \[
  \text{Measure of Arc } EF + \text{Measure of Arc } FG + \text{Measure of Arc } GH + \text{Measure of Arc } HE = 360^\circ
  \]

However, the image does not explicitly show Arcs \( FG \) and \( HE \). Instead, it focuses on Arcs \( EF \) and \( HG \). We assume that the problem intends for us to use only the given arcs \( EF \) and \( HG \) because no additional arc measurements are provided.

##### **Inference 2: Relationship Between Arcs**
- The problem states that the measure of Arc \( EF \) is \( 8x + 6 \) and the measure of Arc \( HG \) is \( 10x - 4 \).
- Since the problem does not provide any additional constraints or relationships between the arcs beyond their measures, we assume the problem intends for us to equate the measures of the arcs or solve for \( x \) using the given expressions directly.

##### **Inference 3: Solving for \( x \)**
- The problem does not specify any direct relationship (e.g., equality) between the arcs. However, since the problem asks to find \( x \), we infer that the measures of the arcs are equal or related in some way. Given the problem's structure, the most likely interpretation is that the measures of the arcs are equal:
  \[
  \text{Measure of Arc } EF = \text{Measure of Arc } HG
  \]
  Substituting the given expressions:
  \[
  8x + 6 = 10x - 4
  \]

##### **Inference 4: Solve the Equation**
- Solve the equation \( 8x + 6 = 10x - 4 \):
  \[
  8x + 6 = 10x - 4
  \]
  Subtract \( 8x \) from both sides:
  \[
  6 = 2x - 4
  \]
  Add 4 to both sides:
  \[
  10 = 2x
  \]
  Divide by 2:
  \[
  x = 5
  \]

#### **Step 3: Conclusion and Selection**
- The value of \( x \) is \( 5 \).
- Matching this with the given choices:
  - A. 1.8
  - B. 5
  - C. 46
  - D. 90

The correct choice is \( B \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
