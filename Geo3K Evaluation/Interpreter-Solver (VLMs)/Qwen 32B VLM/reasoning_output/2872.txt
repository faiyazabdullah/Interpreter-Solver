### Problem Analysis
We are tasked with finding the measure of \( m\angle 1 \) in the given geometric configuration. Let us break down the problem step by step using the provided predicates and visual information.

#### Key Information from Predicates and Image:
1. **Points and Circle:**
   - Points \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \) lie on a circle centered at \( A \).
   - \( \text{Circle}(A) \) is the circle with center \( A \).

2. **Arc Measurement:**
   - The measure of arc \( \overparen{CD} \) is given as \( 218^\circ \).

3. **Chords:**
   - \( \text{Line}(B, C) \) and \( \text{Line}(B, D) \) are chords of the circle.
   - These chords form the angle \( \angle 1 \) at point \( B \).

4. **Goal:**
   - Determine the measure of \( m\angle 1 \).

---

### Step 1: Understanding the Relationship Between Arcs and Angles
From the given predicates, we know that \( \overparen{CD} \) is an arc of the circle, and its measure is \( 218^\circ \). The angle \( \angle 1 \) is an **inscribed angle** subtended by the arc \( \overparen{CD} \).

#### Inscribed Angle Theorem:
The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends. Mathematically:
\[
m\angle 1 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \text{Measure of } \overparen{CD}
\]

---

### Step 2: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem
The measure of \( \overparen{CD} \) is given as \( 218^\circ \). Using the Inscribed Angle Theorem:
\[
m\angle 1 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 218^\circ
\]

Perform the calculation:
\[
m\angle 1 = \frac{218}{2} = 109^\circ
\]

---

### Step 3: Verify Consistency with the Geometry
- The arc \( \overparen{CD} \) spans \( 218^\circ \) of the circle.
- The inscribed angle \( \angle 1 \) subtends this arc, so its measure is half of \( 218^\circ \).
- This aligns with the Inscribed Angle Theorem and the given information.

---

### Step 4: Match the Result with the Choices
The calculated measure of \( m\angle 1 \) is \( 109^\circ \). Comparing this with the provided choices:
- A. \( 54.5 \)
- B. \( 90 \)
- C. \( 109 \)
- D. \( 218 \)

The correct choice is \( C \).

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
