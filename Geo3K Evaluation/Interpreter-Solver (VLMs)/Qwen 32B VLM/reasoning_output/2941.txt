====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Key Observations from the Image and Predicates:
1. **Square Inscribed in a Circle**:
   - Square $ABDC$ is inscribed in $\odot F$, meaning all vertices $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ lie on the circumference of the circle.
   - The center of the circle is $F$.

2. **Properties of the Square**:
   - All sides of the square are equal: 
     \[
     AB = BD = DC = CA.
     \]
   - Each internal angle of the square is $90^\circ$:
     \[
     \text{MeasureOf}(\angle ABD) = \text{MeasureOf}(\angle BDC) = \text{MeasureOf}(\angle DCA) = \text{MeasureOf}(\angle CAB) = 90^\circ.
     \]

3. **Circle Properties**:
   - The radius of the circle is the same for all points on the circumference:
     \[
     FA = FB = FC = FD.
     \]
   - Since $ABDC$ is inscribed, the diagonals of the square ($AC$ and $BD$) are diameters of the circle.

4. **Central Angles**:
   - A central angle is an angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle, and its sides pass through two points on the circumference.
   - For a square inscribed in a circle, the circle is divided into four equal arcs, each subtended by a side of the square.

#### Specific Question:
We need to find the measure of a central angle subtended by one side of the square.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Understanding Central Angles in a Circle
- A central angle is formed by two radii of the circle, with its vertex at the center of the circle.
- For a regular polygon inscribed in a circle, each central angle subtended by a side of the polygon is given by:
  \[
  \text{Central Angle} = \frac{360^\circ}{n},
  \]
  where $n$ is the number of sides of the polygon.

#### Step 2.2: Applying to the Square
- The square has $4$ sides, so $n = 4$.
- The central angle subtended by one side of the square is:
  \[
  \text{Central Angle} = \frac{360^\circ}{4} = 90^\circ.
  \]

#### Step 2.3: Verification Using Predicates
- The square $ABDC$ is inscribed in $\odot F$, and the center $F$ is equidistant from all vertices $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.
- Each side of the square subtends a $90^\circ$ central angle because the circle is divided into four equal arcs by the vertices of the square.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

From the above deductions, the measure of a central angle subtended by one side of the square is $90^\circ$. This matches choice C.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
