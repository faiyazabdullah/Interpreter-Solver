QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

From the image and predicates, we have the following information:

1. **Figure Identification**:
   - Both figures are kites.
   - The larger kite is labeled as $ \text{Quadrilateral}(A, B, C, D) $.
   - The smaller kite is labeled as $ \text{Kite}(1) $.

2. **Areas**:
   - Area of $ \text{Quadrilateral}(A, B, C, D) = 400 \, \text{mm}^2 $.
   - Area of $ \text{Kite}(1) = 64 \, \text{mm}^2 $.

3. **Lengths**:
   - Length of side $ BC $ in the larger kite is $ 40 \, \text{mm} $.
   - Length of a corresponding side in the smaller kite is $ x \, \text{mm} $.

4. **Similarity**:
   - The two kites are similar: $ \text{Similar}(\text{Quadrilateral}(A, B, C, D), \text{Kite}(1)) $.

5. **Key Question**:
   - We need to find the value of $ x $, the length of the corresponding side in the smaller kite.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Use the Property of Similar Figures
Since the two kites are similar, the ratio of their areas is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths. Mathematically, if the ratio of the side lengths is $ r $, then the ratio of the areas is $ r^2 $.

Let the ratio of the side lengths be:
$$
r = \frac{\text{Length of a side in the larger kite}}{\text{Length of the corresponding side in the smaller kite}} = \frac{40}{x}.
$$

The ratio of the areas is given by:
$$
\frac{\text{Area of the larger kite}}{\text{Area of the smaller kite}} = \frac{400}{64}.
$$

#### Step 2.2: Calculate the Ratio of Areas
Compute the ratio of the areas:
$$
\frac{400}{64} = \frac{25}{4}.
$$

Thus, the ratio of the areas is $ \frac{25}{4} $.

#### Step 2.3: Relate the Ratio of Areas to the Ratio of Side Lengths
Since the ratio of the areas is equal to the square of the ratio of the side lengths, we have:
$$
\left( \frac{40}{x} \right)^2 = \frac{25}{4}.
$$

#### Step 2.4: Solve for $ x $
Take the square root of both sides:
$$
\frac{40}{x} = \sqrt{\frac{25}{4}} = \frac{5}{2}.
$$

Now solve for $ x $:
$$
\frac{40}{x} = \frac{5}{2} \implies 40 \cdot 2 = 5 \cdot x \implies 80 = 5x \implies x = \frac{80}{5} = 16.
$$

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

We have determined that $ x = 16 $. Therefore, the correct choice is:

$$
\boxed{B}
$$
