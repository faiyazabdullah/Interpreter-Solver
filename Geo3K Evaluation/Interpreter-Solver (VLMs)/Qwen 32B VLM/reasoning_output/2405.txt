====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image and Predicates:
1. **Lines and Points**:
   - Line \( l \) is defined as \( \overline{DF} \).
   - Line \( m \) is defined as \( \overline{HE} \).
   - Point \( A \) lies on line \( l \) (\( \overline{DF} \)).
   - Point \( C \) lies on line \( m \) (\( \overline{HE} \)).

2. **Parallel Lines**:
   - Lines \( l \) and \( m \) are parallel: \( \parallel(\overline{DF}, \overline{HE}) \).

3. **Angles**:
   - \( \angle DAB = 38^\circ \) (given).
   - \( \angle BCH = 33^\circ \) (given).
   - We need to find the measure of \( \angle ABC \).

4. **Key Relationships**:
   - Since \( l \parallel m \), the transversal \( \overline{BC} \) creates corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and consecutive interior angles.
   - The given angles \( \angle DAB \) and \( \angle BCH \) are exterior to the intersection of the transversal \( \overline{BC} \) with the parallel lines \( l \) and \( m \).

#### Goal:
We need to determine the measure of \( \angle ABC \).

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Identify Key Angles and Relationships
- Since \( l \parallel m \), the transversal \( \overline{BC} \) intersects these lines, creating several angle relationships:
  - \( \angle DAB \) is an exterior angle relative to line \( l \).
  - \( \angle BCH \) is an exterior angle relative to line \( m \).

#### Step 2.2: Use Corresponding Angles and Alternate Interior Angles
- By the properties of parallel lines:
  - The corresponding angle to \( \angle DAB \) on line \( m \) would be equal to \( \angle DAB \) because \( l \parallel m \). However, we are interested in the interior angles formed by the transversal \( \overline{BC} \).

#### Step 2.3: Apply the Exterior Angle Theorem
- The exterior angle \( \angle DAB \) is related to the interior angles of \( \triangle ABC \). Specifically:
  - \( \angle DAB \) is an exterior angle to \( \triangle ABC \) at vertex \( A \).
  - By the Exterior Angle Theorem, the measure of an exterior angle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles:
    \[
    \text{Measure of } \angle DAB = \text{Measure of } \angle ABC + \text{Measure of } \angle BCA.
    \]
  - Therefore:
    \[
    38^\circ = \text{Measure of } \angle ABC + \text{Measure of } \angle BCA.
    \]

#### Step 2.4: Use the Given Angle \( \angle BCH \)
- The angle \( \angle BCH \) is an exterior angle to \( \triangle ABC \) at vertex \( C \):
  - By the Exterior Angle Theorem:
    \[
    \text{Measure of } \angle BCH = \text{Measure of } \angle ABC + \text{Measure of } \angle BAC.
    \]
  - Therefore:
    \[
    33^\circ = \text{Measure of } \angle ABC + \text{Measure of } \angle BAC.
    \]

#### Step 2.5: Solve for \( \angle ABC \)
- From the two equations derived:
  1. \( 38^\circ = \text{Measure of } \angle ABC + \text{Measure of } \angle BCA \)
  2. \( 33^\circ = \text{Measure of } \angle ABC + \text{Measure of } \angle BAC \)

- Notice that \( \angle BCA \) and \( \angle BAC \) are the two non-adjacent interior angles of \( \triangle ABC \) when considering the transversal \( \overline{BC} \). Since the problem does not provide additional information about \( \angle BCA \) or \( \angle BAC \), we focus on the direct relationship between \( \angle DAB \) and \( \angle ABC \).

- The key insight is that \( \angle DAB \) and \( \angle BCH \) are related through the transversal and parallel lines. The measure of \( \angle ABC \) can be directly deduced as the difference between \( \angle DAB \) and \( \angle BCH \):
  \[
  \text{Measure of } \angle ABC = 38^\circ - 33^\circ = 5^\circ.
  \]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

Upon re-evaluating the relationships and ensuring consistency, the correct approach involves recognizing that the measure of \( \angle ABC \) is the difference between the given exterior angles due to the parallel lines and transversal properties. Thus, the measure of \( \angle ABC \) is:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]

Final Answer: \boxed{D}
