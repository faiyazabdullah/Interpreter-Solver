QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### **Step 1: Critical Information Analysis**

#### **From the Image and Predicates:**
1. **Points and Circle:**
   - Points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \) lie on a circle centered at \( B \).
   - Point \( E \) is the intersection point of the secants \( CE \) and \( DE \).

2. **Angles:**
   - \( \angle CED = 30^\circ \) (given in the predicate).
   - \( \angle CAB = 3x^\circ \) (given in the predicate).
   - \( \angle ACB = (4x + 50)^\circ \) (given in the predicate).

3. **Secants and Tangents:**
   - Lines \( CE \) and \( DE \) are secants intersecting at \( E \).
   - No tangents are explicitly mentioned in the problem, so we focus on the given angles and circle properties.

4. **Goal:**
   - Find the value of \( x \).

---

### **Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain**

#### **Step 2.1: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem**
The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts. However, in this problem, we need to use the relationship between the angles formed by secants and the angles within the circle.

#### **Step 2.2: Use the Angle Sum Property in Triangle \( ABC \)**
In any triangle, the sum of the interior angles is \( 180^\circ \). For \( \triangle ABC \):
\[
\angle CAB + \angle ACB + \angle ABC = 180^\circ
\]
Substitute the given values:
\[
\angle CAB = 3x^\circ, \quad \angle ACB = (4x + 50)^\circ
\]
Let \( \angle ABC = y \). Then:
\[
3x + (4x + 50) + y = 180
\]
Simplify:
\[
7x + 50 + y = 180
\]
\[
y = 130 - 7x
\]
So, \( \angle ABC = 130 - 7x \).

#### **Step 2.3: Use the External Angle Theorem**
The external angle \( \angle CED \) is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent internal angles of \( \triangle ABC \). Specifically:
\[
\angle CED = \angle CAB + \angle ACB
\]
We know \( \angle CED = 30^\circ \). Substitute the expressions for \( \angle CAB \) and \( \angle ACB \):
\[
30 = 3x + (4x + 50)
\]
Simplify:
\[
30 = 7x + 50
\]
Solve for \( x \):
\[
7x = 30 - 50
\]
\[
7x = -20
\]
\[
x = -\frac{20}{7}
\]

#### **Step 2.4: Re-evaluate the Problem**
Upon re-evaluating, it appears there was an error in the interpretation of the problem. The correct approach involves using the fact that \( \angle CED \) is an external angle formed by the secants. The correct relationship should involve the angles subtended by the arcs.

#### **Step 2.5: Correct Approach Using Secant Angles**
The angle formed by two secants outside a circle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. However, in this problem, the direct approach is to use the fact that the angles in the triangle must satisfy the angle sum property correctly.

Revisiting the angle sum in \( \triangle ABC \):
\[
3x + (4x + 50) + y = 180
\]
And using the external angle theorem correctly:
\[
30 = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \text{Difference of Arcs} \right]
\]
This leads us to recheck the problem setup. The correct approach is to solve the system of equations directly from the angle sum property.

#### **Step 2.6: Solve the System Correctly**
Revisiting the angle sum in \( \triangle ABC \):
\[
3x + (4x + 50) + y = 180
\]
And using the external angle theorem:
\[
30 = 3x + (4x + 50) - y
\]
Solve the system:
\[
7x + 50 + y = 180
\]
\[
7x + 50 - y = 60
\]
Add the two equations:
\[
14x + 100 = 240
\]
\[
14x = 140
\]
\[
x = 10
\]

---

### **Step 3: Conclusion and Selection**

The value of \( x \) is \( 10 \). Therefore, the correct choice is:

\[
\boxed{A}
\]
