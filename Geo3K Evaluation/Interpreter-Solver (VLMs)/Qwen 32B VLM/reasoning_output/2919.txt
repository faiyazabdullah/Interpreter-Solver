### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image and Predicates:
1. **Points and Rhombus Structure**:
   - The vertices of the rhombus are labeled as \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( X \).
   - The diagonals of the rhombus are \( AX \) and \( BC \).

2. **Key Relationships**:
   - The diagonals \( AX \) and \( BC \) are perpendicular to each other (Predicate: Perpendicular(Line(A,X), Line(B,C))).
   - One diagonal (\( AX \)) is twice as long as the other diagonal (\( BC \)):
     - \( \text{LengthOf}(AX) = 2x \)
     - \( \text{LengthOf}(BC) = x \)
   - The area of the rhombus is given as 169 square millimeters:
     - \( \text{AreaOf(Rhombus(A,B,C,X))} = 169 \).

3. **Objective**:
   - Find the lengths of the diagonals \( AX \) and \( BC \).

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Formula for the Area of a Rhombus
The area of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2
\]
where \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \) are the lengths of the diagonals.

From the problem:
- Let \( d_1 = AX = 2x \)
- Let \( d_2 = BC = x \)

Substitute these into the area formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (2x) \times x = x^2
\]

#### Step 2.2: Solve for \( x \) Using the Given Area
The area of the rhombus is given as 169 square millimeters:
\[
x^2 = 169
\]

Take the square root of both sides:
\[
x = \sqrt{169} = 13
\]

#### Step 2.3: Calculate the Lengths of the Diagonals
- The length of the shorter diagonal \( BC \) is:
  \[
  BC = x = 13
  \]
- The length of the longer diagonal \( AX \) is:
  \[
  AX = 2x = 2 \times 13 = 26
  \]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The lengths of the diagonals are:
- Shorter diagonal \( BC = 13 \)
- Longer diagonal \( AX = 26 \)

The question asks for the lengths of the diagonals. The correct choice is:
- **Shorter diagonal**: 13
- **Longer diagonal**: 26

Thus, the correct answer corresponds to the longer diagonal, which is \( 26 \).

Final Answer: **C**. 26

\[
\boxed{C}
\]
