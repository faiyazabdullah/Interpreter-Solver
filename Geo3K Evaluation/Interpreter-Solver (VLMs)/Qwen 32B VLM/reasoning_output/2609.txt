QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Key Information from Predicates and Image:
1. **Circle \( M \)**:
   - Points \( F, G, H, J, K, P \) lie on the circle.
   - \( M \) is the center of the circle.

2. **Lines and Perpendiculars**:
   - \( FG \) is a chord, and \( KL \) is its perpendicular bisector.
   - \( HP \) is a chord, and \( MN \) is its perpendicular bisector.
   - \( FL = 24 \), so \( LG = 24 \) because \( L \) is the midpoint of \( FG \).
   - \( HJ = 48 \).

3. **Angles and Arcs**:
   - \( m\widehat{HP} = 65^\circ \).
   - \( KL \perp FG \) and \( MN \perp HP \).

4. **Key Question**:
   - Find \( m\widehat{HJ} \).

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Analyze the Geometry of the Circle
- Since \( M \) is the center of the circle, \( MF = MG = MH = MJ = MK = MP \) (radii of the circle).
- \( KL \) is the perpendicular bisector of \( FG \), so \( L \) is the midpoint of \( FG \). This implies \( FL = LG = 24 \).
- \( MN \) is the perpendicular bisector of \( HP \), so \( N \) is the midpoint of \( HP \).

#### Step 2.2: Use the Given Arc Measurement
- We are given \( m\widehat{HP} = 65^\circ \). This means the central angle \( \angle HMP = 65^\circ \).

#### Step 2.3: Determine the Length of Chord \( HP \)
- Since \( N \) is the midpoint of \( HP \), and \( MN \) is the perpendicular bisector, \( HN = NP \).
- However, the length of \( HP \) is not directly needed to solve for \( m\widehat{HJ} \).

#### Step 2.4: Use the Perpendicular Bisectors and Symmetry
- The perpendicular bisector \( KL \) divides \( FG \) into two equal parts, and similarly, \( MN \) divides \( HP \) into two equal parts.
- The perpendicular bisectors also indicate symmetry in the circle, which helps in understanding the arc relationships.

#### Step 2.5: Relate \( m\widehat{HP} \) to \( m\widehat{HJ} \)
- The problem does not provide a direct relationship between \( \widehat{HP} \) and \( \widehat{HJ} \) through arc measures. Instead, we need to use the fact that \( HJ \) is a chord and its length is given.
- Since \( HJ = 48 \), and \( HJ \) is a chord, we need to determine the arc \( \widehat{HJ} \) that subtends this chord.

#### Step 2.6: Use the Inscribed Angle Theorem and Central Angles
- The central angle subtended by a chord is twice the inscribed angle subtending the same arc.
- However, we are not given any inscribed angles directly. Instead, we use the fact that the total circumference of the circle is \( 360^\circ \).

#### Step 2.7: Calculate \( m\widehat{HJ} \)
- The problem provides \( m\widehat{HP} = 65^\circ \). Since \( HJ \) is a longer chord and spans a larger arc, we need to consider the symmetry and the fact that \( HJ \) is twice the length of \( HP \).
- By symmetry and the properties of circles, if \( m\widehat{HP} = 65^\circ \), then the arc \( \widehat{HJ} \) must be twice the measure of \( \widehat{HP} \) because \( HJ \) is twice the length of \( HP \).

#### Step 2.8: Final Calculation
- Since \( HJ \) is a longer chord and spans a larger arc, the arc \( \widehat{HJ} \) is twice the measure of \( \widehat{HP} \):
  \[
  m\widehat{HJ} = 2 \times 65^\circ = 130^\circ.
  \]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The measure of \( \widehat{HJ} \) is \( 130^\circ \).

Final Answer: \boxed{C}
