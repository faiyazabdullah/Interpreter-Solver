QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- The image shows a circle with center \( C \).
- Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( D \) lie on the circle.
- Line segment \( AB \) is the diameter of the circle.
- Point \( C \) lies on line segment \( AB \) and is the midpoint of \( AB \).
- Triangle \( ABD \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ADB = 90^\circ \).
- Line segment \( AD \) is perpendicular to line segment \( BD \).
- The length of \( AD \) is given as 2 units.
- Angle \( \angle 2 \) is subtended by arc \( BD \) at point \( A \).

#### From the Predicates:
1. **Points and Circle Relationships:**
   - \( A \), \( B \), and \( D \) lie on the circle with center \( C \).
   - \( AB \) is the diameter of the circle.
   - \( C \) is the midpoint of \( AB \), so \( AC = BC \).

2. **Triangle Properties:**
   - \( \triangle ABD \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ADB = 90^\circ \).
   - \( AD \) and \( BD \) are the legs of the right triangle, and \( AB \) is the hypotenuse.
   - \( C \) is the midpoint of \( AB \), making \( C \) the circumcenter of \( \triangle ABD \).

3. **Key Measurements:**
   - \( \text{Length}(AD) = 2 \).
   - \( \text{Measure}(\angle ADB) = 90^\circ \).

4. **Angle Subtended by Arc:**
   - \( \angle 2 \) is the angle subtended by arc \( BD \) at point \( A \).

#### What We Need to Find:
- The measure of \( \angle 2 \).

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Analyze the Right Triangle \( \triangle ABD \)
- Since \( \angle ADB = 90^\circ \), \( \triangle ABD \) is a right triangle.
- \( AB \) is the hypotenuse of \( \triangle ABD \).
- \( C \) is the midpoint of \( AB \), so \( C \) is also the circumcenter of \( \triangle ABD \). This means \( AC = BC \), and both are radii of the circle.

#### Step 2.2: Use the Inscribed Angle Theorem
- The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that an angle inscribed in a circle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.
- Here, \( \angle 2 \) is an inscribed angle subtending arc \( BD \).
- The central angle subtending arc \( BD \) is \( \angle BCD \).

#### Step 2.3: Determine \( \angle BCD \)
- Since \( C \) is the center of the circle, \( \angle BCD \) is a central angle.
- In \( \triangle BCD \), \( C \) is the midpoint of \( AB \), and \( \triangle BCD \) is isosceles with \( BC = CD \) (both are radii).
- Since \( \angle ADB = 90^\circ \), the arc \( BD \) is a semicircle minus the arc \( AD \).
- The full circle is \( 360^\circ \), and since \( AB \) is the diameter, arc \( AB \) is \( 180^\circ \).
- Therefore, arc \( BD \) is half of the semicircle, which is \( 90^\circ \).

#### Step 2.4: Relate \( \angle 2 \) to \( \angle BCD \)
- By the Inscribed Angle Theorem:
  \[
  \text{Measure of } \angle 2 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Measure of } \angle BCD
  \]
- Since \( \angle BCD = 90^\circ \):
  \[
  \text{Measure of } \angle 2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 90^\circ = 45^\circ
  \]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The measure of \( \angle 2 \) is \( 45^\circ \).

Thus, the correct choice is:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
