====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual and Predicate Analysis:
1. **Square $ABCD$:**
   - The square is labeled $ABCD$, with vertices $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.
   - All sides of the square are equal in length.
   - The side length of the square is given as $AD = DC = CF = FA = 14 \, \text{yd}$.

2. **Circle:**
   - The circle is centered at point $H$, which lies inside the square.
   - The circle is **circumscribed to the square**, meaning it touches the square at the midpoints of its sides.
   - Key points of tangency are $E$, $G$, $I$, and $M$, where the circle touches the sides $AD$, $DC$, $CF$, and $FA$, respectively.

3. **Key Relationships:**
   - The radius of the circle is the perpendicular distance from the center $H$ to any side of the square.
   - Since the circle is tangent to the square at the midpoints of its sides, the radius of the circle is half the side length of the square.

4. **Given Measurements:**
   - The side length of the square is $14 \, \text{yd}$.
   - The circle's radius is the perpendicular distance from $H$ to any side of the square.

#### Question:
We need to find the exact circumference of the circle.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Determine the Radius of the Circle
- The circle is circumscribed to the square, meaning it touches the square at the midpoints of its sides.
- The radius of the circle is the perpendicular distance from the center $H$ to any side of the square.
- Since the square is symmetric and the circle is tangent at the midpoints, the radius is half the side length of the square.
- From the given information, the side length of the square is $14 \, \text{yd}$. Therefore, the radius $r$ of the circle is:
  $$
  r = \frac{\text{side length of the square}}{2} = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \, \text{yd}.
  $$

#### Step 2.2: Calculate the Circumference of the Circle
- The formula for the circumference $C$ of a circle is:
  $$
  C = 2\pi r.
  $$
- Substituting the radius $r = 7 \, \text{yd}$ into the formula:
  $$
  C = 2\pi \times 7 = 14\pi.
  $$

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The exact circumference of the circle is $14\pi$. Therefore, the correct choice is:

$$
\boxed{B}
$$

Final Answer: $\boxed{B}$
