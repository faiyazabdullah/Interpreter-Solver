====================================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Deductive Solution:

#### **Step 1: Critical Information Analysis**
From the given predicates and the image:
1. **Quadrilateral \(WXYZ\) is a rectangle**:
   - Opposite sides are congruent: \(WX \cong YZ\) and \(XY \cong ZW\).
   - All angles are right angles: \(\angle WXY = \angle XYZ = \angle YZW = \angle ZWX = 90^\circ\).

2. **Key Angles and Measurements**:
   - \(\angle 1 = 30^\circ\) (given).
   - \(\angle 1\) is part of the diagonal intersection at point \(A\).

3. **Diagonals \(WY\) and \(XZ\)**:
   - The diagonals intersect at point \(A\), which is the midpoint of both diagonals.
   - The diagonals bisect each other, meaning \(WA = AY\) and \(XA = AZ\).

4. **Vertical Angles**:
   - \(\angle 9\) and \(\angle 10\) are vertical angles.
   - \(\angle 11\) and \(\angle 12\) are vertical angles.
   - Vertical angles are congruent: \(\angle 9 \cong \angle 10\) and \(\angle 11 \cong \angle 12\).

5. **Right Angles**:
   - The rectangle has four right angles at its vertices.

#### **Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain**

##### **Part 1: Analyze \(\angle 1\) and its relationship to other angles**
- \(\angle 1\) is formed by the intersection of diagonals \(WY\) and \(XZ\) at point \(A\).
- Since \(WXYZ\) is a rectangle, the diagonals \(WY\) and \(XZ\) bisect each other and are equal in length.
- The diagonals also create several pairs of congruent triangles by symmetry.

##### **Part 2: Use properties of the rectangle and diagonal intersection**
- The diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other, so point \(A\) is the midpoint of both \(WY\) and \(XZ\).
- This means \(\triangle AWX \cong \triangle AYZ\) and \(\triangle AXY \cong \triangle AZW\) by SSS (side-side-side) congruence.

##### **Part 3: Determine \(\angle 3\)**
- \(\angle 3\) is one of the angles formed by the diagonal \(XZ\) and the side \(YZ\) of the rectangle.
- Since \(XYZ\) is a right angle (\(\angle XYZ = 90^\circ\)), and \(\angle 3\) is part of this configuration, we need to analyze the relationships between the angles formed by the diagonal \(XZ\).

- From the image and predicates, \(\angle 3\) is complementary to \(\angle 1\) because they form a linear pair with the right angle at \(Y\):
  \[
  \angle 3 + \angle 1 = 90^\circ
  \]
  - This is because \(\angle XYZ = 90^\circ\) and \(\angle 3\) is part of the right angle split by the diagonal \(XZ\).

- Given \(\angle 1 = 30^\circ\):
  \[
  \angle 3 = 90^\circ - 30^\circ = 60^\circ
  \]

#### **Step 3: Conclusion and Selection**
The measure of \(\angle 3\) is \(60^\circ\). Therefore, the correct choice is:

\[
\boxed{C}
\]

Final Answer: \(\boxed{C}\)
