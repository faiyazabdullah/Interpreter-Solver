### Step-by-Step Deductive Solution:

#### **Step 1: Critical Information Analysis**

From the given predicates and the image:

1. **Points and Circle**:
   - Points \( B, D, E, F, C \) are labeled.
   - \( D \) and \( F \) lie on the circle with center \( E \).
   - \( E \) is the center of the circle.

2. **Tangents**:
   - \( \overline{BD} \) is tangent to the circle at point \( D \).
   - \( \overline{FC} \) is tangent to the circle at point \( F \).

3. **Radii**:
   - \( \overline{ED} \) and \( \overline{EF} \) are radii of the circle.
   - Radii are equal: \( \text{LengthOf}(\overline{ED}) = \text{LengthOf}(\overline{EF}) \).

4. **Perpendicularity**:
   - \( \overline{ED} \perp \overline{BD} \) (radius is perpendicular to the tangent at the point of tangency).
   - \( \overline{EF} \perp \overline{FC} \) (radius is perpendicular to the tangent at the point of tangency).

5. **Given Angle**:
   - \( \text{MeasureOf}(\angle BDC) = 102^\circ \).

6. **Objective**:
   - Find the measure of \( \angle 1 \), which is formed by \( \overline{FC} \) and the radius \( \overline{EF} \).

---

#### **Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain**

##### **Step 2.1: Analyze the Tangent-Radius Relationship**
- By definition, a radius drawn to a point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent line.
  - Therefore, \( \overline{ED} \perp \overline{BD} \implies \angle EDB = 90^\circ \).
  - Similarly, \( \overline{EF} \perp \overline{FC} \implies \angle EFC = 90^\circ \).

##### **Step 2.2: Use the Inscribed Angle Theorem**
- The angle \( \angle BDC \) is an external angle formed by two tangents \( \overline{BD} \) and \( \overline{FC} \) intersecting outside the circle.
- According to the **External Tangent Angle Theorem**, the measure of the angle between two tangents drawn from an external point is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs.
  - However, since we are working with the direct angle measurement given, we use the relationship between the external angle and the internal angles formed by the radii.

##### **Step 2.3: Calculate \( \angle DEF \)**
- Since \( \overline{ED} \) and \( \overline{EF} \) are radii, they are equal in length, and \( \triangle EDF \) is isosceles with \( ED = EF \).
- The angle \( \angle BDC \) is an external angle to \( \triangle EDF \). The measure of \( \angle BDC \) is given as \( 102^\circ \).

##### **Step 2.4: Relate \( \angle BDC \) to Internal Angles**
- In \( \triangle EDF \), the sum of the internal angles is \( 180^\circ \).
- Let \( \angle DEF = x \). Since \( \overline{ED} \perp \overline{BD} \) and \( \overline{EF} \perp \overline{FC} \):
  - The angle \( \angle BDC \) is the external angle formed by extending \( \overline{BD} \) and \( \overline{FC} \).
  - The internal angle \( \angle DEF \) is related to \( \angle BDC \) by the property of tangents and radii.

##### **Step 2.5: Solve for \( \angle 1 \)**
- The angle \( \angle 1 \) is the angle between the tangent \( \overline{FC} \) and the radius \( \overline{EF} \).
- Since \( \overline{EF} \perp \overline{FC} \), \( \angle EFC = 90^\circ \).
- The angle \( \angle 1 \) is part of the larger angle \( \angle BDC \), and by symmetry and the properties of tangents, it is half the supplement of \( \angle BDC \):
  \[
  \angle 1 = 180^\circ - \angle BDC = 180^\circ - 102^\circ = 78^\circ.
  \]

---

#### **Step 3: Conclusion and Selection**

The measure of \( \angle 1 \) is \( 78^\circ \).

Thus, the correct choice is:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
