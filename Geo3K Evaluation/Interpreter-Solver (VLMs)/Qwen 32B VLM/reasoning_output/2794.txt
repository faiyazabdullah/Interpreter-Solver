### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the scale factor between two similar rectangles, given their areas. The blue rectangle has an area of $8 \, \text{in}^2$, and the green rectangle has an area of $32 \, \text{in}^2$. The side length of the blue rectangle is given as $4 \, \text{in}$, and we need to determine the corresponding side length $x$ of the green rectangle. Finally, we will use the relationship between the areas of similar figures to find the scale factor.

### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
1. **Blue Rectangle:**
   - Area: $8 \, \text{in}^2$
   - One side length: $4 \, \text{in}$

2. **Green Rectangle:**
   - Area: $32 \, \text{in}^2$
   - One side length: $x \, \text{in}$

3. **Similarity:**
   - The rectangles are similar, meaning their corresponding sides are proportional, and the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### **Step 2.1: Calculate the Missing Side of the Blue Rectangle**
The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its length and width. For the blue rectangle:
\[
\text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
\]
Let the unknown side of the blue rectangle be $y$. Then:
\[
8 = 4 \times y
\]
Solving for $y$:
\[
y = \frac{8}{4} = 2 \, \text{in}
\]
So, the dimensions of the blue rectangle are $4 \, \text{in} \times 2 \, \text{in}$.

#### **Step 2.2: Use the Similarity Property**
Since the rectangles are similar, the ratio of their corresponding side lengths is constant. Let the scale factor from the blue rectangle to the green rectangle be $k$. Then:
\[
\text{Side length of green rectangle} = k \times \text{Side length of blue rectangle}
\]
This means:
\[
x = k \times 4
\]
and the other side of the green rectangle is:
\[
k \times 2
\]

#### **Step 2.3: Relate the Areas of Similar Figures**
The ratio of the areas of two similar figures is the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths. Therefore:
\[
\frac{\text{Area of green rectangle}}{\text{Area of blue rectangle}} = k^2
\]
Substituting the given areas:
\[
\frac{32}{8} = k^2
\]
Simplify:
\[
4 = k^2
\]
Taking the square root of both sides:
\[
k = 2
\]

#### **Step 2.4: Verify the Scale Factor**
The scale factor $k = 2$ means that each side of the green rectangle is twice the corresponding side of the blue rectangle. This is consistent with the areas:
- Blue rectangle: $4 \, \text{in} \times 2 \, \text{in} = 8 \, \text{in}^2$
- Green rectangle: $(2 \times 4) \, \text{in} \times (2 \times 2) \, \text{in} = 8 \, \text{in} \times 4 \, \text{in} = 32 \, \text{in}^2$

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The scale factor from the blue rectangle to the green rectangle is $2$. In fractional form, this is $\frac{2}{1}$.

Thus, the correct choice is:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
