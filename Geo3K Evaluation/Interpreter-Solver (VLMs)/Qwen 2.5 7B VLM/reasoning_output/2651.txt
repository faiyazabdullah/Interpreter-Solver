QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's break down the given information and use geometric properties and theorems to find the measure of ∠ZAC.

### Step 1: Identify Key Angles and Properties
- Quadrilateral ABCD is inscribed in circle ⊙Z.
- ∠BZA = 104°.
- Arc CB measures 94°.
- AB || DC.
- We need to find ∠ZAC.

### Step 2: Analyze the Inscribed Angle
Since ∠BZA is an inscribed angle subtending arc BC, the measure of arc BC is twice the measure of ∠BZA. However, it is given that arc BC measures 94°, which is consistent with the inscribed angle theorem because:
\[ m\text{arc } BC = 2m\text{∠BZA} \]
Given \( m\text{∠BZA} = 104^\circ \):
\[ m\text{arc } BC = 2 \times 104^\circ = 208^\circ \]

### Step 3: Identify Relationships Between Arcs
The total measure of the circle is 360°. Therefore, the remaining arcs in the circle sum up to:
\[ 360^\circ - 208^\circ = 152^\circ \]

### Step 4: Use Parallel Lines and Inscribed Angles
Since AB || DC, the corresponding angles formed by these lines and the circle are supplementary. This means that if ∠BZA is 104°, then the corresponding inscribed angle ∠ZAD should also be 104°.

### Step 5: Calculate ∠ZAC
Given that ∠ZAC is part of the cyclic quadrilateral ABCD and considering the symmetry and the fact that AB || DC, we can deduce that ∠ZAC is half the measure of arc AD.

Since arc AD is the remaining arc after subtracting arc BC from the circle:
\[ m\text{arc } AD = 152^\circ \]

Thus, the measure of ∠ZAC is half of arc AD:
\[ m\text{∠ZAC} = \frac{1}{2} \times 152^\circ = 76^\circ \]

However, upon re-evaluating the problem and the choices provided, it seems there might be a misinterpretation in the angle calculation due to the symmetrical properties of the inscribed angles and parallel lines. Let's reassess the angle ∠ZAC directly from the inscribed angle property relative to the given arc lengths.

Since ∠BZA is 104°, and considering the symmetrical properties in a cyclic quadrilateral, the correct measure of ∠ZAC would be:
\[ m\text{∠ZAC} = 94^\circ \]

### Conclusion
Given the provided choices and the geometric properties, the correct measure of ∠ZAC is 94°.
