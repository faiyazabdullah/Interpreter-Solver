To solve the problem, we need to determine which angles are supplementary to \(\angle 1\). Let's analyze the given information and use geometric properties to find the correct angles.

### Step 1: Identify the Relationships
- Line \(l\) is parallel to line \(m\).
- Line \(n\) intersects both lines \(l\) and \(m\) at point \(C\).

### Step 2: Apply the Corresponding Angles Property
Since \(l\) is parallel to \(m\) and \(n\) intersects both, we can use the corresponding angles property:
- \(\angle 1\) corresponds to \(\angle 2\) (same side interior angles).
- \(\angle 1\) corresponds to \(\angle 7\) (same side interior angles).

### Step 3: Determine Supplementary Angles
Supplementary angles add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, the angles that are supplementary to \(\angle 1\) are those that form a straight line with it when extended.

- \(\angle 2\) and \(\angle 1\) are on the same side of the transversal \(n\) and are supplementary.
- \(\angle 7\) and \(\angle 1\) are also on the same side of the transversal \(n\) and are supplementary.

### Step 4: Verify Other Angles
- \(\angle 3\) and \(\angle 4\) are not on the same side of the transversal \(n\) and do not form a straight line with \(\angle 1\).
- \(\angle 6\) and \(\angle 8\) are not directly related to \(\angle 1\) in terms of being supplementary because they are on different sides of the transversal \(n\).

### Conclusion
The angles that are supplementary to \(\angle 1\) are \(\angle 2\) and \(\angle 7\).

Thus, the correct choice is:
