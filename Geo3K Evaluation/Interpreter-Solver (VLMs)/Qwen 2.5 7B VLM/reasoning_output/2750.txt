====================================================================================================
Let's break down the problem step-by-step using the given geometric figure and predicates.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
- We have a rectangle \( ELCI \) with a length of 14 feet and a width of 9 feet.
- There are right angles at points \( A \), \( C \), and \( I \).
- Points \( A \) and \( B \) are connected such that they form a right angle with point \( I \).
- The shaded area needs to be calculated.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. **Calculate the area of the rectangle \( ELCI \)**:
   - The area of a rectangle is given by length \(\times\) width.
   - Length \( EL = 14 \) ft and Width \( LI = 9 \) ft.
   - Therefore, the area of rectangle \( ELCI \):
     \[
     \text{Area of } ELCI = 14 \times 9 = 126 \text{ square feet}
     \]

2. **Analyze the shaded region**:
   - The shaded region appears to be a right triangle \( ABC \) with the right angle at \( I \).
   - Since \( A \) and \( B \) are connected forming a right angle with \( I \), the base \( AB \) and height \( AI \) are perpendicular to each other.
   - To find the area of \( \triangle ABC \), we need the lengths of \( AB \) and \( AI \).

3. **Determine the lengths \( AB \) and \( AI \)**:
   - Since \( A \) and \( B \) form a right angle with \( I \), and considering the geometry, we can infer that \( AB \) and \( AI \) are perpendicular bisectors of the rectangle.
   - From the given figure, it seems \( AI \) is the height from \( A \) to \( BC \). This height is equal to the width of the rectangle, which is 9 feet.
   - The length \( AB \) can be derived from the geometry of the rectangle and the placement of \( A \) and \( B \). However, without additional information, we can assume \( AB \) is the same as the length of the rectangle, which is 14 feet.

4. **Calculate the area of \( \triangle ABC \)**:
   - Using the formula for the area of a triangle:
     \[
     \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 14 \times 9 = \frac{1}{2} \times 126 = 63 \text{ square feet}
     \]

5. **Calculate the shaded area**:
   - The shaded area is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the triangle \( ABC \):
     \[
     \text{Shaded Area} = \text{Area of } ELCI - \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = 126 - 63 = 63 \text{ square feet}
     \]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The calculated shaded area is 63 square feet. Therefore, the correct answer is:
