QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Let's analyze the given geometric figure and predicates systematically to determine the length of GH, where G and H are the midpoints of RS and BA respectively.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
- We have a trapezoid QRST.
- RS = 54
- QT = 86
- A and B are midpoints of QR and ST respectively.
- AB is parallel to QT.
- RS is parallel to QT.
- AB is parallel to RS.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. Since AB is parallel to QT and A and B are midpoints, AB acts as the median of trapezoid QRST.
2. According to the properties of a trapezoid, the sum of the lengths of the non-parallel sides (RS and QT) is twice the length of the median AB.
   \[
   RS + QT = 2 \times AB
   \]
3. Substitute the given values:
   \[
   54 + 86 = 2 \times AB
   \]
   \[
   140 = 2 \times AB
   \]
   \[
   AB = \frac{140}{2} = 70
   \]

4. Since G is the midpoint of RS and H is the midpoint of BA, GH is the median of triangle RBA.

5. In triangle RBA, since AB is parallel to RT and A is the midpoint of QR, AB acts as the median of triangle RBA.

6. The length of the median in a triangle that connects a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side is half the length of the side it bisects.
   Therefore,
   \[
   GH = \frac{AB}{2}
   \]
   Substituting the value of AB:
   \[
   GH = \frac{70}{2} = 35
   \]

However, there seems to be an error in the interpretation of the problem. The correct interpretation should be that GH is the median connecting the midpoints of the non-parallel sides RS and BA. Thus, the correct formula would be:
\[
GH = \frac{RS}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27
\]

### Conclusion and Selection
The correct length of GH is 27.
