QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Let's solve the problem step-by-step using the given predicates and geometric properties.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
- We are given that quadrilateral \(WXYZ\) is a rectangle.
- Angle \(1\) is measured at \(30^\circ\).
- We need to find the measure of angle \(5\).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. Since \(WXYZ\) is a rectangle, all its interior angles are right angles (\(90^\circ\)).
2. Therefore, angles \(1\), \(2\), \(3\), \(4\), \(5\), \(6\), \(7\), and \(8\) are all \(90^\circ\) because they are part of the rectangle's structure.
3. Given that \(m\angle 1 = 30^\circ\), this means the remaining angles involving point \(A\) must sum up appropriately within the rectangle's structure.

### Step 3: Combining Predicates
- From the diagram, angles \(1\) and \(4\) are adjacent angles forming a straight line. Thus, their measures add up to \(180^\circ\).
- Since \(m\angle 1 = 30^\circ\), it follows that \(m\angle 4 = 180^\circ - 30^\circ = 150^\circ\).
- However, we know that in a rectangle, angles on the same side of the diagonals formed by point \(A\) should be supplementary when combined with the right angles of the rectangle.

### Step 4: Finding Angle \(5\)
- Angle \(5\) is located at vertex \(Y\) and forms a right angle with the diagonal \(AX\).
- Since \(XYZ\) forms a right angle (\(90^\circ\)), and considering the symmetry in the rectangle, the angle directly opposite \(1\) and \(4\) (which is \(5\)) should balance out the \(30^\circ\) to fit within the right angles provided by the rectangle.

### Step 5: Conclusion and Selection
- Given the symmetry and properties of the rectangle, the angle \(5\) must be supplementary to the given \(30^\circ\) angle but fitting into the right angles constraints.
- Therefore, \(m\angle 5\) must be \(90^\circ - 30^\circ = 60^\circ\).
