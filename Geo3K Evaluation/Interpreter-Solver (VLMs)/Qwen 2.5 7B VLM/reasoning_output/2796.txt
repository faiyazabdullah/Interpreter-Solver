QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**
- We have a circle centered at point \( B \) with points \( X \) and \( Y \) lying on it.
- There is a tangent line at point \( Y \) passing through point \( A \).
- Point \( W \) lies on the line segment \( XY \).
- Arc \( YX \) is given as 96°.
- Angle \( \angle YBX = 96^\circ \).

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**

1. **Identify the Inscribed Angles and Central Angles:**
   - The measure of arc \( YX \) is given as 96°. By the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the inscribed angle subtended by arc \( YX \) is half the measure of the central angle subtended by arc \( YX \).
   - Therefore, the inscribed angle \( \angle YBX \) is half of the central angle subtended by arc \( YX \).

2. **Calculate the Measure of \( \angle YBX \):**
   - Since the inscribed angle \( \angle YBX \) is equal to half of the central angle subtended by arc \( YX \):
     \[
     \text{Measure of } \angle YBX = \frac{1}{2} \times 96^\circ = 48^\circ
     \]

3. **Determine the Measure of Arc \( YXZ \):**
   - The total measure of arc \( YXZ \) can be found by adding the measures of arcs \( YX \) and \( XZ \).
   - Since arc \( XZ \) spans the remaining part of the circle after arc \( YX \), the measure of arc \( XZ \) is:
     \[
     \text{Measure of } \angle YBX + \text{Measure of } \angle YXZ = 180^\circ
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     \text{Measure of } \angle YXZ = 180^\circ - 96^\circ = 84^\circ
     \]

4. **Combine the Measures to Find \( m\widehat{YXZ} \):**
   - The measure of arc \( YXZ \) is the sum of arcs \( YX \) and \( XZ \):
     \[
     m\widehat{YXZ} = 96^\circ + 84^\circ = 180^\circ
     \]

5. **Consider the Tangent Line:**
   - The tangent line at \( Y \) implies that the angle between the tangent line and the radius \( BY \) is 90°.

6. **Calculate the Total Measure:**
   - The total measure around the circle is 360°. Subtracting the known measures:
     \[
     360^\circ - 180^\circ = 180^\circ
     \]

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**
- The measure of arc \( YXZ \) is 180°.
- Since the total circumference is 360°, the remaining arc \( YXZ \) forms a complete semicircle.

Therefore, the measure of \( m\widehat{YXZ} \) is:
\[
\boxed{180}
\]

**Final Answer: None of the provided choices match 180°. Therefore, there seems to be a discrepancy. The correct answer should be re-evaluated.**
