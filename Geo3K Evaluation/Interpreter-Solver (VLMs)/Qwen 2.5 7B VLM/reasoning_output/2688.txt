QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve for the value of \( t \) in the parallelogram, let's analyze the given information step-by-step.

### Step 1: Identify Key Relationships
- We have a parallelogram \( WXYZ \).
- The diagonals \( WX \) and \( YZ \) intersect at point \( B \).
- Point \( B \) is the midpoint of both diagonals.
- The lengths are given as \( WB = 8 \) and \( BY = 6 \).

### Step 2: Apply Midpoint Property
Since \( B \) is the midpoint of both diagonals:
\[ WB = BY \]
\[ BX = BZ \]

Given:
\[ WB = 8 \]
\[ BY = 6 \]

From the midpoint property:
\[ XB = BY = 6 \]

### Step 3: Use the Parallelogram Property
In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. Therefore:
\[ XB = BZ \]
Since \( XB = 6 \):
\[ BZ = 6 \]

### Step 4: Determine Lengths Using Given Expressions
We know that:
\[ XB = s - 7 \]
\[ BZ = 2t - 6 \]

Since \( XB = BZ \):
\[ s - 7 = 2t - 6 \]

### Step 5: Solve for \( t \)
Rearrange the equation to isolate \( t \):
\[ s - 7 = 2t - 6 \]
\[ s - 7 + 6 = 2t \]
\[ s - 1 = 2t \]

From the problem statement, we do not have a direct value for \( s \). However, we can see that the only value among the choices that fits the form \( s - 1 \) is when \( s = 7 \):
\[ 7 - 1 = 6 \]
Thus:
\[ t = 3 \]

### Step 6: Verify the Value
Since none of the provided choices match 3, we need to check if there was a mistake or if the problem might have a different interpretation. However, based on the given choices:
- The closest match is \( s = 7 \), which would make \( t = 3 \).

Given the choices, the closest reasonable answer is:
\[ t = 7 \]

Final Answer: B
