To solve the problem, let's break down the given information and derive the necessary relationships step-by-step.

### Step 1: Understanding the Geometric Setup
We have a square \(ABCD\) with side length \(s\). Point \(Q\) lies on line segment \(QC\), and the length of \(QC = 15\) and \(CQ' = x\).

### Step 2: Analyzing the Length Relationships
From the given information:
- \(QC = 15\)
- \(QC' = x\)

Since \(Q'\) is the reflection of \(Q\) across the center of the square, and considering the symmetry of the square, \(Q'\) will lie on the opposite side of \(C\) at a distance equal to \(x\) but in the opposite direction. Hence, if \(Q\) is at position \(15\) units away from \(C\), then \(Q'\) will be at position \(-x\) units away from \(C\).

### Step 3: Calculating the Scale Factor
The scale factor from \(Q\) to \(Q'\) is determined by the ratio of the lengths of these segments. Since \(Q'\) is directly opposite \(Q\) over the diagonal of the square, the total distance \(QQ'\) is twice the distance from \(Q\) to the center of the square plus the distance from the center to \(Q'\).

Given that \(QC = 15\) and \(CQ' = x\), the total distance \(QQ'\) can be calculated as follows:
\[ QQ' = QC + CQ' = 15 + x \]

However, since \(Q\) and \(Q'\) are symmetrically placed across the center of the square, the actual distance \(QQ'\) is effectively doubled the distance from \(Q\) to the center minus the distance from \(Q\) to \(C\):
\[ QQ' = 2 \times 15 = 30 \]
Thus, the scale factor from \(Q\) to \(Q'\) is:
\[ \text{Scale Factor} = \frac{QQ'}{QC} = \frac{30}{15} = 2 \]

### Conclusion
The scale factor from \(Q\) to \(Q'\) is \(2\).
