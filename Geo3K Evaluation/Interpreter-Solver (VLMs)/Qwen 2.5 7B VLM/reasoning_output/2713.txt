QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**

From the given information, we know that ABCD is a parallelogram. The lengths and angles at some vertices are provided:
- Length of AD = 29
- Length of CD = 25
- Length of BC = 3y - 4
- Length of AB = 5x
- Angle FAD = 49°
- Angle FDA = 34°
- Angle FCD = 54°

We need to find the measure of angle CDF.

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**

1. Since ABCD is a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel.
   - Therefore, AB = CD and AD = BC.
   - From the given lengths, AB = 5x and CD = 25. Hence, 5x = 25 → x = 5.

2. Similarly, AD = BC, so BC = 29.

3. In parallelogram ABCD, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at point F, which is the intersection of the diagonals of the parallelogram.

4. Since F is the intersection of the diagonals, it divides each diagonal into two equal parts. This implies that the diagonals bisect each other.

5. We know the measures of angles FAD and FDA, which are 49° and 34° respectively. By the properties of a parallelogram, angle FCD is supplementary to angle FDA because they form linear pairs.

6. Therefore, angle FCD = 180° - angle FDA = 180° - 34° = 146°.

7. Now, consider triangle FCD. The sum of angles in a triangle is 180°. So,
   - Angle CFD + Angle FDC + Angle FCD = 180°.
   - Angle CFD + 54° + 146° = 180°.
   - Angle CFD = 180° - 54° - 146° = 8°.

However, there seems to be an inconsistency here since angle CFD should be calculated directly from the properties of the parallelogram. Let's correct our approach.

8. Since F is the intersection of the diagonals, and considering the symmetry and properties of parallelograms, we should use the fact that the angles around point F sum up to 360°.

9. Given the angles at FAD and FDA, and knowing that the total angles around point F sum up to 360°, we need to find the correct angle CDF.

10. Correctly calculating:
    - Angle CDF = 180° - angle FCD - angle FDC = 180° - 54° - 34° = 92°.

11. Therefore, angle CDF = 92° / 2 = 47°.

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**

Given the correct angle calculations, the measure of angle CDF is 47°.
