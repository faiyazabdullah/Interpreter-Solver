QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, let's break it down step-by-step using the given information and geometric properties.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
- We know that \( FL = 24 \) and \( HJ = 48 \).
- The arc \( \widehat{HP} \) measures 65 degrees.
- We need to find the measure of arc \( \widehat{HJ} \).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. **Identify Chords and Arcs**: Since \( H \) and \( P \) lie on the circle \( \odot M \), they form chord \( HP \). Similarly, \( H \) and \( J \) form chord \( HJ \).
2. **Central Angle and Inscribed Angle Relationship**: The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Therefore, the inscribed angle \( \angle HJP \) intercepting arc \( \widehat{HJ} \) will have a measure related to the arc \( \widehat{HJ} \).
3. **Given Arc Measure**: The measure of arc \( \widehat{HP} \) is 65 degrees. Since \( \angle HJP \) is an inscribed angle intercepting arc \( \widehat{HJ} \), the measure of arc \( \widehat{HJ} \) should be twice the measure of \( \angle HJP \).

### Step 3: Calculations
- Let the measure of arc \( \widehat{HJ} \) be \( x \).
- Since \( \angle HJP \) is an inscribed angle, its measure is half the measure of the arc it intercepts. Therefore, if \( \angle HJP = y \), then \( x = 2y \).
- Given that the measure of arc \( \widehat{HP} \) is 65 degrees, and considering the symmetry and properties of the circle, the angle \( \angle HJP \) is also influenced by the arc \( \widehat{HP} \).

### Combining Information
- The total arc around the circle is 360 degrees.
- Arc \( \widehat{HJ} \) plus arc \( \widehat{HP} \) should sum up to the remaining arcs on the circle, but since these are adjacent arcs, their sum should reflect the total circumference minus the central arc.

Given the symmetry and the properties of the circle, we can infer that the measure of arc \( \widehat{HJ} \) should be such that it forms a consistent relationship with the given arc \( \widehat{HP} \).

### Conclusion
After careful analysis, we find that the measure of arc \( \widehat{HJ} \) should be calculated as follows:
\[ x = 360 - 65 = 295 \]
However, this does not fit the typical geometric relationships expected in this problem. Instead, we consider the correct interpretation which should be:
\[ x = 130 \]

Thus, the measure of arc \( \widehat{HJ} \) is 130 degrees.

**Final Answer: C**
