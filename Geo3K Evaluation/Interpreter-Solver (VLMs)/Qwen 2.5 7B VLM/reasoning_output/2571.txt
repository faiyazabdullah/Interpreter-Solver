QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Let's solve the problem step-by-step using the given geometric relationships and the predicates provided.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the image, we have two arcs:
- Arc(EF) with measure \(8x + 6\).
- Arc(HG) with measure \(10x - 4\).

According to the given predicates, these arcs are subtended by chords \(EH\) and \(FG\) respectively. Since they lie on the same circle, their measures should be equal because they intercept the same arc.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. **Given Equations:**
   - Measure of Arc(EF) = \(8x + 6\)
   - Measure of Arc(HG) = \(10x - 4\)

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   Since the arcs are equal:
   \[
   8x + 6 = 10x - 4
   \]

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   8x + 6 = 10x - 4
   \]
   Subtract \(8x\) from both sides:
   \[
   6 = 2x - 4
   \]
   Add 4 to both sides:
   \[
   10 = 2x
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
We have solved the equation correctly and found that \(x = 5\). Therefore, the correct choice is:
