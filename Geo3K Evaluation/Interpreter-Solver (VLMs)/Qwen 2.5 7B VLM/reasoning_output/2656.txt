QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Let's start by analyzing the given information and applying geometric principles step-by-step.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

- We have a parallelogram \(ABCD\).
- The length of \(AD\) is 13 yards.
- The length of \(AB\) is 10 yards.
- The measure of \(\angle EBC = 45^\circ\).
- Line \(DE\) is perpendicular to line \(BC\).
- Line \(AB\) is parallel to line \(CD\).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

1. Since \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. Therefore, \(AB = CD\) and \(AD = BC\).
   - Hence, \(CD = 13\) yards and \(BC = 10\) yards.

2. Since \(\angle EBC = 45^\circ\) and \(DE\) is perpendicular to \(BC\), \(\triangle DEB\) is a right triangle with \(\angle DEB = 90^\circ\). This implies that \(\angle EDB = 45^\circ\) because the sum of angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\).

3. In a right triangle where two angles are equal, they must both be \(45^\circ\), making it a 45-45-90 triangle. Thus, \(DE = EB\).

4. Using the properties of a 45-45-90 triangle, the length of the hypotenuse \(EB\) can be found using the relationship \(h = s\sqrt{2}\), where \(s\) is the length of a leg.
   - Here, \(s = 10\) yards.
   - Therefore, \(EB = 10\sqrt{2}\) yards.

5. The height \(DE\) of the parallelogram can be calculated as half of \(EB\) since it forms a 45-45-90 triangle with the base \(BC\).
   - So, \(DE = \frac{10\sqrt{2}}{2} = 5\sqrt{2}\) yards.

6. Now, calculate the area of the parallelogram using the formula \( \text{Area} = \text{base} \times \text{height} \).
   - Base \(BC = 10\) yards.
   - Height \(DE = 5\sqrt{2}\) yards.
   - Area \(= 10 \times 5\sqrt{2} = 50\sqrt{2}\) square yards.

7. Simplify \(50\sqrt{2}\) to approximate the numerical value.
   - \(\sqrt{2} \approx 1.414\).
   - Therefore, \(50\sqrt{2} \approx 50 \times 1.414 = 70.7\).

8. Round \(70.7\) to the nearest tenth.
   - Final area approximation is \(70.7\), which is closest to \(71\).

### Conclusion and Selection

The calculated area of the parallelogram is approximately \(71\) square yards. However, since none of the provided choices match exactly \(71\), we need to choose the closest option from the given choices.
