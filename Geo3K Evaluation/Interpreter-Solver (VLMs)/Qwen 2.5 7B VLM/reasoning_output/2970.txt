QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Let's begin by analyzing the given information and using the predicates to deduce the measure of angle WYZ.

**Step 1: Critical Information Analysis**

- We know that WXY and WZY are congruent triangles.
- Angle BYA is given as 23 degrees.
- WXYZ is a quadrilateral with right angles at X and Z.
- WXY and WZY are right triangles because they have right angles at X and Z respectively.

**Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain**

1. Since WXYZ is a quadrilateral and has right angles at X and Z, it implies that WXY and WZY are right triangles.
2. The measure of angle WYZ can be found by considering the properties of the right triangles WXY and WZY.
3. The angle WYZ is half of angle BYA because angle BYA is bisected into two equal parts by WYZ in the context of the right triangles formed.

Given:
- Measure of angle BYA = 23°
- Angle BYA is bisected by WYZ into two equal angles.

Thus:
- Measure of angle WYZ = Half of Measure of angle BYA
- Measure of angle WYZ = Half of 23° = 11.5°

However, since the choices provided are whole numbers, and there seems to be a mistake in the interpretation or calculation, let's re-evaluate the problem using the provided choices.

**Re-evaluation with Choices:**

- Since the measure of angle BYA is 23° and angle WYZ is half of that, we need to check the closest possible choice among the given options.

The closest value to 11.5° among the provided choices is 16°.

Therefore, the correct answer should be:
