QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Let's start by analyzing the given geometric figure and predicates step-by-step.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

From the image and predicates:
- Point \(B\) lies on the circle with center \(E\).
- Point \(D\) lies on the circle with center \(E\).
- Point \(F\) lies on the circle with center \(E\).
- Line \(BD\) is tangent to the circle at point \(D\).
- Line \(FC\) is tangent to the circle at point \(F\).
- The measure of \(\angle BDC\) is given as \(102^\circ\).
- \(ED\) and \(EF\) are radii of the circle.
- Line \(ED\) is perpendicular to line \(BD\).
- Line \(EF\) is perpendicular to line \(FC\).
- \(ED = EF\).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Properties of Tangent Lines
Since \(BD\) and \(FC\) are tangents to the circle at points \(D\) and \(F\) respectively, we know the following:
- The angle between a tangent and a radius drawn to the point of tangency is \(90^\circ\). Therefore:
  - \(\angle EDB = 90^\circ\).
  - \(\angle EFC = 90^\circ\).

#### Step 2.2: Inscribed Angle Theorem
The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts. However, since the problem involves tangents and perpendicularity rather than intercepted arcs directly, we need to focus on the relationships involving the tangents and the right angles they form with the radii.

#### Step 2.3: Right Triangles
Given that \(\angle EDB = 90^\circ\) and \(\angle EFC = 90^\circ\), triangles \(EBD\) and \(EFC\) are right triangles.

#### Step 2.4: Equal Radii
Since \(ED = EF\) and both are radii of the same circle, \(\triangle EBD \cong \triangle EFC\) by the Hypotenuse-Leg Congruence (HL) theorem because they share a common hypotenuse \(EB\) and have equal legs \(ED = EF\).

#### Step 2.5: Perpendicular Bisectors and Symmetry
Because \(ED = EF\) and \(E\) is the center, \(ED\) and \(EF\) are equal lengths, indicating symmetry around the center \(E\). This symmetry implies that the angles subtended by these chords are related symmetrically.

#### Step 2.6: Calculation of \(\angle 1\)
Since \(\angle EDB = 90^\circ\) and \(\angle EFC = 90^\circ\), and considering the symmetry and the fact that the total angle around point \(E\) sums up to \(360^\circ\), we can use the given \(\angle BDC = 102^\circ\).

By examining the angles around the circle, the measure of \(\angle 1\) can be deduced to be supplementary to the given angle \(\angle BDC\). 

#### Step 2.7: Supplementary Angles
Since the angles around a point sum to \(360^\circ\) and \(\angle BDC = 102^\circ\), the angle \(\angle 1\) must be such that together with \(\angle BDC\), they form a full circle minus the supplementary angle.

Thus, \(\angle 1 = 360^\circ - 102^\circ = 258^\circ\).

However, the supplementary relationship within the circle and the given angles suggest the correct calculation should be:
\[
\angle 1 = 180^\circ - 102^\circ = 78^\circ.
\]

### Conclusion

The measure of \(\angle 1\) is \(78^\circ\).
