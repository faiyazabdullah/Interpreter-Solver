====================================================================================================
To determine which fact would be sufficient to prove that line \( d \) is parallel to \( XZ \), we need to analyze the given angles and their relationships within the geometric figure.

First, let's summarize the relevant points:
- Line \( d \) passes through point \( Y \).
- Line \( XY \) intersects line \( AZ \) at point \( Y \).
- Angles \( \angle 1 \), \( \angle 2 \), and \( \angle 3 \) are formed at point \( Y \).

Given that line \( d \) is supposed to be parallel to \( XZ \), we should look for corresponding angles or alternate interior angles that would satisfy the parallel lines theorem.

Let's examine the choices:

A. \(\angle 1 \cong \angle 3\)
   - This pair of angles is not in a position to determine parallelism directly. They do not appear to be corresponding angles or alternate interior angles relative to \( d \) and \( XZ \).

B. \(\angle 1 \cong \angle Z\)
   - This suggests that \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle Z\) are corresponding angles if line \( d \) were parallel to \( XZ \). However, this does not provide a clear relationship between the lines without additional context or verification.

C. \(\angle 2 \cong \angle X\)
   - Similarly, this angle pair does not form a direct relationship that can be used to prove parallelism based on the given configuration.

D. \(\angle 3 \cong \angle Z\)
   - This suggests that \(\angle 3\) and \(\angle Z\) are corresponding angles if line \( d \) were parallel to \( XZ \). This is a strong candidate because if these angles are equal, it would indicate that line \( d \) is indeed parallel to \( XZ \).

Given the analysis, the only angle pair that logically fits the condition for determining parallelism is \(\angle 3\) and \(\angle Z\).
