QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's analyze the given information and deduce the length of \( CK \).

**Step 1: Critical Information Analysis**

- We know that \( \odot J \) has a radius of 10 units.
- \( \odot K \) has a radius of 8 units.
- \( BC = 5.4 \).
- Points \( A, B, C, D, J, K \) lie on their respective circles.
- \( AB = BJ = 10 \) because \( J \) is the center of \( \odot J \) and \( B \) lies on it.
- \( KC = KD = 8 \) because \( K \) is the center of \( \odot K \) and \( C \) lies on it.
- Line \( AD \) passes through points \( A, B, C, D \).

**Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain**

1. Since \( AB = 10 \) and \( BC = 5.4 \), we need to find \( CK \).
2. We know \( BC = 5.4 \), so we need to find the remaining segment \( CK \) such that \( BK = BC + CK \).
3. Since \( BK \) forms a straight line with \( B \) and \( K \) being on the same circle \( \odot K \), we can use the Pythagorean theorem in the context of the circle's geometry.

Given that \( BK = BC + CK \):

\[ BK = BC + CK = 5.4 + CK \]

Since \( BK \) is a chord in \( \odot K \) with radius 8, and using the fact that the total distance \( BK \) can be broken down into segments related to the circle's radius, we can calculate:

\[ BK^2 = BC^2 + CK^2 \]

Substituting known values:

\[ (BK)^2 = (5.4 + CK)^2 = BC^2 + CK^2 \]
\[ (5.4 + CK)^2 = 5.4^2 + CK^2 \]

Let's solve for \( CK \):

\[ (5.4 + CK)^2 = 5.4^2 + CK^2 \]
\[ 5.4^2 + 2 \cdot 5.4 \cdot CK + CK^2 = 5.4^2 + CK^2 \]

Simplify:

\[ 5.4 \cdot CK = 0 \]

Thus, \( CK = 3.6 \). However, this doesn't match our options, so we need to re-evaluate the geometry considering the correct configuration.

Given the symmetry and the lengths involved, the correct approach would involve recognizing that the total length \( BK \) can be directly subtracted from the circle's radius considerations.

Using the correct geometric interpretation:

\[ CK = 8 - 5.4 = 2.6 \]

**Step 3: Conclusion and Selection**

The correct length of \( CK \) is \( 2.6 \).
