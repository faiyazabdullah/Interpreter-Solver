QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**
- We are given that the measure of arc \( JK \) is \( 26^\circ \).
- The measure of arc \( GF \) is \( 88^\circ \).
- Point \( G \) lies on circle \( B \), point \( J \) lies on circle \( B \), point \( K \) lies on circle \( B \), and point \( F \) lies on circle \( B \).
- Line \( HJ \) is a secant line intersecting circle \( B \) at points \( J \) and \( K \).
- Line \( HF \) is a secant line intersecting circle \( B \) at points \( H \) and \( F \).
- We need to find the measure of angle \( \angle GHK \).

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**

1. **Inscribed Angle Theorem**: The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
   - For arc \( JK \): \( \angle GHK = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Measure of arc } JK \)
     \[
     \angle GHK = \frac{1}{2} \times 26^\circ = 13^\circ
     \]
   
2. **Sum of Angles in a Triangle**: In triangle \( GHK \), the sum of the interior angles is \( 180^\circ \).
   - Since \( \angle GHK = 13^\circ \), we need to find the remaining angle.
   - Let's denote the angle \( \angle GHK \) as \( x \). Then:
     \[
     \angle GHK + \angle GHF + \angle HFK = 180^\circ
     \]
     - We know that \( \angle GHF \) and \( \angle HFK \) are also inscribed angles intercepting arcs \( GF \) and \( JK \) respectively.
     - Therefore:
       \[
       \angle GHF = \frac{1}{2} \times 88^\circ = 44^\circ
       \]
       \[
       \angle HFK = \frac{1}{2} \times 26^\circ = 13^\circ
       \]

3. **Calculate \( \angle GHK \)**:
   \[
   13^\circ + 44^\circ + 13^\circ = 70^\circ
   \]

4. **Conclusion**: The measure of angle \( \angle GHK \) is \( 70^\circ \).

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**
- Based on the calculated value, the correct answer should be checked against the choices provided.
- The closest value among the given choices is \( 62^\circ \), but since it doesn't match exactly, we need to re-evaluate the problem carefully.

Upon re-evaluation, the correct answer should be \( 31^\circ \).
