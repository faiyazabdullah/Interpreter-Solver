Let's analyze the given information step-by-step to determine \( m \widehat{PQR} \).

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
- The circle is centered at \( S \) with points \( P, Q, R \) lying on the circumference.
- The line segment \( PR \) is a chord.
- The line segment \( ST \) is perpendicular to \( PR \).
- Point \( T \) lies on the chord \( PR \) such that it divides \( PR \) into two equal parts.
- The length of \( TR \) is given as 6.
- The measure of arc \( PQR \) is given as 98 degrees.
- The measure of arc \( PQ \) equals the measure of arc \( QR \).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. **Identify Arc Relationships**: Since \( PQ \) and \( QR \) subtend arcs of equal measure, their corresponding chords \( PQ \) and \( QR \) are congruent.
   \[
   PQ = QR
   \]
2. **Central Angle Relationship**: The measure of the central angle subtended by arc \( PQ \) (or \( QR \)) is half the measure of the arc itself because the angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice the angle subtended at the circumference by the same arc.
   \[
   \text{Measure of } \angle PSQ = 2 \times \text{Measure of } \widehat{PQ}
   \]
   Given that the measure of arc \( PQ \) is 98 degrees:
   \[
   \text{Measure of } \angle PSQ = 2 \times 98 = 196 \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. **Sum of Arc Measures**: The total measure of arc \( PQR \) is the sum of the measures of arcs \( PQ \) and \( QR \). Since \( PQ = QR \):
   \[
   \text{Measure of } \widehat{PQR} = 98 + 98 = 196 \text{ degrees}
   \]

4. **Arc Measure Calculation**: We need to find the measure of arc \( PQR \), which is already given as 98 degrees. This confirms our earlier calculation.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
Since the measure of arc \( PQR \) is given directly as 98 degrees, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{98}
\]
