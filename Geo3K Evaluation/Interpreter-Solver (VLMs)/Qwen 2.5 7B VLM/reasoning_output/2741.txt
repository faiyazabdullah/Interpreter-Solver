QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Let's start by analyzing the given information:

1. **Pentagon PQRS T**: The pentagon \(PQRST\) is equilateral and inscribed in the circle \(\odot U\).

2. **Inscribed in Circle**: Since the pentagon is inscribed in the circle, all its vertices lie on the circle. This means that each side of the pentagon subtends a chord on the circle.

3. **Equal Lengths**: All sides of the pentagon are equal because it is equilateral. Therefore, \(PQ = QR = RS = ST = TP\).

4. **Central Angles**: The central angle subtended by each side of the pentagon at the center of the circle \(U\) is the same. Since there are five sides, the total measure of the central angles is \(360^\circ\). Thus, each central angle is:
   \[
   \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
   \]

5. **Angle PSR Calculation**: We need to find the measure of \(\angle PSR\). Notice that \(\angle PSR\) is an interior angle of the pentagon formed by two radii of the circle and a chord connecting points \(P\) and \(S\).

6. **Sum of Interior Angles of a Pentagon**: The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is:
   \[
   (5-2) \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
   \]

7. **Sum of Central Angles**: The sum of the central angles of the pentagon is also \(360^\circ\). However, these central angles do not directly help us find \(\angle PSR\) unless we use the fact that the pentagon is symmetric and regular.

Given that the pentagon is regular and inscribed in a circle, each angle formed by two radii and a chord (such as \(\angle PSR\)) is actually half the sum of the adjacent central angles minus the central angle itself. However, a simpler approach is to recognize that since the pentagon is symmetric and equilateral, the angle \(\angle PSR\) can be found by considering the symmetry of the shape.

By symmetry and the properties of the inscribed equilateral pentagon, the angle \(\angle PSR\) is simply the exterior angle of a regular pentagon, which is:
   \[
   360^\circ / 5 = 72^\circ
   \]

Thus, the measure of \(\angle PSR\) is \(108^\circ\) but considering the internal angle formed by the intersection of chords, it simplifies to:
   \[
   180^\circ - 72^\circ = 108^\circ
   \]

However, the correct measure of the angle formed by the intersection of two chords subtending the same arc is indeed:
   \[
   108^\circ
   \]

Thus, the measure of \(\angle PSR\) is indeed:
   \[
   108^\circ
   \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
