QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Let's analyze the given geometric figure and predicates step-by-step.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
- We have a triangle \(ABC\) with point \(G\) as its incenter.
- \(G\) lies on the angle bisectors of \(\angle BAC\), \(\angle ABC\), and \(\angle ACB\).
- Points \(E\) and \(F\) lie on lines \(AB\) and \(BC\) respectively, such that \(GE \perp AB\) and \(GF \perp BC\).
- Perpendiculars from \(G\) intersect \(AC\) at \(D\) forming right angles \(\angle GDC\), \(\angle GEA\), and \(\angle GFC\).
- Lengths are given as \(GC = 13\), \(BC = 12\).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. Since \(G\) is the incenter, it is equidistant from all sides of the triangle. Thus, \(GE = GF\).
2. Given \(GC = 13\) and \(BC = 12\), letâ€™s consider the right triangles formed by the perpendiculars from \(G\).
3. Because \(G\) is the incenter, \(G\) is equidistant from the sides, implying the perpendicular distances from \(G\) to these sides are equal.

Using the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle GDC\):
\[ GC^2 = GD^2 + DC^2 \]
Given \(GC = 13\):
\[ 13^2 = GD^2 + DC^2 \]
\[ 169 = GD^2 + DC^2 \]

Since \(D\) divides \(AC\), we need to determine the length of \(EG\) using the fact that the incenter divides the angle bisectors proportionally.

4. Using the fact that \(G\) is the incenter, the lengths \(GE\) and \(GF\) are equal, and they form right triangles with the sides of the triangle. Since \(GC\) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle \(\triangle GDC\), and knowing the lengths:
\[ EG = GF = \sqrt{13^2 - DC^2} \]

However, since \(E\) and \(F\) are symmetrically placed, the length \(EG\) is simply the distance from \(G\) to \(AB\) which is equal to the altitude from \(G\) to \(AB\). 

By symmetry and the properties of the incenter, \(EG\) can be deduced directly from the given length \(GC = 13\). Given the right triangles and the symmetry of the incenter, \(EG = 5\).

### Conclusion and Selection
Based on the analysis, \(EG = 5\).
