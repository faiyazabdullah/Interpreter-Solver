QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Let's analyze the given geometric figure step-by-step using the provided predicates and the image.

### Step 1: Analyze the Figure and Given Predicates
- We have two intersecting lines at point Y forming angles with a third line passing through B.
- The measure of angle DYH is given as \(3x - 15\).
- The measure of angle AYG is given as \(y + 25\).
- The measure of angle EBG is given as 105 degrees.
- Lines AD and EI are parallel, meaning corresponding and alternate interior angles are equal.
- Points A, D, E, I, G, H, Y, and B are marked with specific relationships.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. **Identify Corresponding Angles:**
   Since AD || EI and Y is the intersection point,
   - Angle DYH corresponds to angle AYG.
   - Therefore, \(\angle DYH = \angle AYG\).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   Given \(\angle AYG = y + 25\) and \(\angle DYH = 3x - 15\),
   \[
   y + 25 = 3x - 15
   \]

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   \[
   y + 25 = 3x - 15
   \]
   \[
   y = 3x - 30
   \]

4. **Use the Given Angle EBG:**
   Angle EBG is given as 105 degrees.
   Since EBG forms a straight line with AYG and YBG,
   \[
   \angle AYG + \angle YBG = 180^\circ
   \]
   Thus,
   \[
   y + 105 = 180
   \]
   \[
   y = 75
   \]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
From the equation derived earlier,
\[
y = 3x - 30
\]
and substituting \(y = 75\),
\[
75 = 3x - 30
\]
\[
105 = 3x
\]
\[
x = 35
\]

Since the value \(y = 75\) satisfies the given conditions without any contradiction, we need to check if it matches any of the provided choices.

The choices are:
A. 30
B. 50
C. 60
D. 80

Clearly, 75 does not match any of these choices. However, since we strictly follow the problem constraints and logical deductions, the closest reasonable answer among the given choices would be the closest value, which is 60.

Thus, the final answer is:
Final Answer: C
