QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
Let's start by analyzing the given information and the relationships between the points and lines in the figure.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
- We have a circle \(C\) centered at \(C\).
- Points \(X\) and \(Z\) lie on the circle.
- Line \(YX\) and line \(YZ\) are tangents to the circle at points \(X\) and \(Z\) respectively.
- The measure of \(\angle XYZ = 68^\circ\).
- The arc \(WXZ\) measures \(224^\circ\).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. **Identify the relationship between the arc and the inscribed angle**: According to the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts.
   - Since \(\angle XYZ\) intercepts arc \(WXZ\), we have:
     \[
     \text{Measure of } \angle XYZ = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Measure of } WXZ
     \]
     Substituting the given values:
     \[
     68^\circ = \frac{1}{2} \times 224^\circ
     \]
     This confirms the given arc measure.

2. **Identify the measure of the remaining arc \(XZ\)**:
   - The total measure of the circle is \(360^\circ\).
   - Arc \(WXZ\) measures \(224^\circ\).
   - Therefore, arc \(XZ\) measures:
     \[
     360^\circ - 224^\circ = 136^\circ
     \]

3. **Determine the measure of \(\angle X CZ\)**:
   - Given that \(\angle X CZ\) is a central angle intercepting arc \(XZ\), its measure is equal to the measure of arc \(XZ\):
     \[
     \text{Measure of } \angle X CZ = 136^\circ
     \]

4. **Calculate \(\angle X C Z\)**:
   - We know \(\angle X CZ\) is supplementary to \(\angle X CZ\) in the triangle \(XCZ\).
   - The sum of angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\).
   - Since \(\angle X CZ\) and \(\angle X CZ\) are supplementary:
     \[
     \text{Measure of } \angle X CZ = 180^\circ - \text{Measure of } \angle X CZ
     \]
     Therefore,
     \[
     \text{Measure of } \angle X CZ = 180^\circ - 136^\circ = 44^\circ
     \]

5. **Determine \(\angle X Y Z\)**:
   - Given \(\angle XYZ = 68^\circ\) and the perpendicularity conditions, we need to find \(\angle X Y Z\).
   - Using the fact that the sum of angles around point \(Y\) is \(360^\circ\):
     \[
     \text{Measure of } \angle X Y Z = 360^\circ - \angle XYZ - \angle X CZ
     \]
     Substituting the known values:
     \[
     \text{Measure of } \angle X Y Z = 360^\circ - 68^\circ - 44^\circ = 248^\circ
     \]
