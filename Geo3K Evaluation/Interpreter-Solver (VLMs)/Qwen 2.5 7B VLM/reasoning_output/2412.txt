QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
**STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**
- We know that JKLM is a rectangle.
- MLPR is a rhombus.
- Angles ∠JMK and ∠RMP are congruent, and their measure is given as 55°.
- ∠KML is a right angle in rectangle JKLM.
- We need to find the measure of ∠KML.

**STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**

1. Since JKLM is a rectangle, all its interior angles are right angles.
   - Therefore, ∠KML = 90°.

2. Since MLPR is a rhombus, all its sides are equal.
   - This means ∠MRL = ∠MPL = ∠LPR = ∠LRP = 70°.

3. Since ∠JMK and ∠RMP are congruent and both measure 55°, we can use these to find related angles within the rhombus.

4. In the rhombus MLPR:
   - The sum of the angles around point M is 360°.
   - Thus, ∠MLP + ∠MPL + ∠MPR + ∠PML = 360°.
   - Given ∠MPL = 70° and ∠MPR = 70°, the remaining two angles must sum up to:
     - 360° - 70° - 70° = 220°.
   - Since ∠MLP and ∠PML are congruent in the rhombus:
     - Let ∠MLP = x. Then ∠PML = x.
     - So, 2x + 70° = 220°.
     - Solving for x: 2x = 150° → x = 75°.
   - Hence, ∠MLP = 75° and ∠PML = 75°.

5. Now consider the angles around point K in the rectangle:
   - Since ∠KML is a right angle (90°) and ∠KML is adjacent to ∠KML, the sum of ∠KML and ∠KLM must be 90°.
   - ∠KML = 90°.

**STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**

Given the analysis above, it's clear that the measure of ∠KML is 90°, which corresponds to choice A.
