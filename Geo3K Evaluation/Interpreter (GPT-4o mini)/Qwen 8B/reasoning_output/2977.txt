<think>
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we need to find GD, which I assume is the length of the segment between points G and D. Let me start by parsing all the given predicates carefully.

First, there's a Triangle(G, H, J). That means points G, H, and J form a triangle. Then there are several equality statements involving lengths and angles. 

Looking at the LengthOf(Line(G,D)) equals 2x - 2. Wait, but GD is part of this? Because Line(G,D) would be the segment connecting G and D. But the problem mentions finding GD, so maybe that's the same as the length here. But wait, the other lengths given are Line(D,H) = 7 and Line(H,J) = 10. Also, there's an Angle(G,D,H) measure equal to 2x + 4 degrees. Hmm.

So, points involved are G, H, J, D. The triangle is G-H-J. But where is point D? It's mentioned in the line segments GD, DH, and also in the angle at D. So, D is connected to G and H. Maybe D is a point somewhere such that GD and DH are sides forming an angle at D. Wait, the angle is MeasureOf(Angle(G,D,H)), which is the angle at D between points G, D, H. So that angle is formed by DG and DH. Therefore, triangle GDH has angle at D, with sides DG and DH. We know DH is 7 units long (from Line(D,H) = 7), and DG is 2x - 2. Also, the angle at D is 2x + 4 degrees.

But how does this relate to the rest? There's also the triangle GHJ with side HJ being 10. But how do these connect? Is there a relationship between triangles GDH and GHJ? Or perhaps some other triangle?

Wait, maybe triangle GDH is part of triangle GHJ? Let me try to visualize. Points G, H, J form a triangle. Point D is another point connected to G and H. So, maybe D lies somewhere in relation to triangle GHJ. For example, if we consider triangle GHJ, and D is a point connected to G and H, creating a smaller triangle or something else.

Alternatively, could there be more than one triangle here? Since Triangle(G,H,J) is given, and other lines involve D. So, perhaps D is a point outside or inside triangle GHJ. Let me think about the Law of Cosines here. In triangle GDH, if we have two sides and the included angle, maybe we can relate them to something else.

But wait, we don't have the third side of triangle GDH. The sides are GD (which is 2x - 2), DH (7), and the angle between them is 2x + 4. However, without knowing the third side or another angle, maybe we need more information. Alternatively, maybe triangle GHJ gives us something else. For instance, if we can find some relations between the triangles GDH and GHJ.

Wait, but we know HJ is 10. If we can express HJ in terms of x, maybe via triangle GDH or other triangles. But how?

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to use the Law of Cosines in triangle GDH. Let me write down what I have:

In triangle GDH:
- GD = 2x - 2
- DH = 7
- Angle at D: 2x + 4 degrees
Let’s denote angle at D as θ = 2x + 4. Then, applying the Law of Cosines, the third side GH can be found. Wait, GH is a side of triangle GHJ. Let me check: in triangle GHJ, sides are GH, HJ=10, and GJ. But unless we know more about triangle GHJ, like angles or other sides, it's unclear. However, if we can express GH from triangle GDH, maybe there's a connection.

Wait, GH is a common side between triangles GDH and GHJ. So, if we compute GH from triangle GDH, then perhaps we can use that in triangle GHJ. But triangle GHJ has sides GH, HJ=10, and GJ. Without more info, like angles or other sides, we can’t directly relate them. Unless there's another relationship. Wait, but maybe triangle GDH relates to triangle GHJ in some way?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a missing piece here. Let me re-examine the given data. Are there any other equalities or relationships? The only other thing is the presence of point D and the angle at D. Maybe we need to consider triangle GDH and triangle GHJ together.

Wait, but if we can express GH from triangle GDH using Law of Cosines, and then maybe apply Law of Cosines again in triangle GHJ? But for that, we'd need more information about triangle GHJ. Alternatively, maybe there's an assumption that triangle GHJ is a right triangle or something else? Not stated.

Wait, but maybe there's another angle or side we can find. Let me think again. The problem asks for GD, which is 2x - 2. So, if we can find the value of x, then we can compute GD. How?

We need to find x. To do that, maybe we can set up equations based on the given information. Let's see. From triangle GDH, using Law of Cosines:

GH² = GD² + DH² - 2 * GD * DH * cos(angle at D)

Which is:

GH² = (2x - 2)² + 7² - 2*(2x - 2)*7*cos(2x + 4)

But GH is also a side of triangle GHJ. However, without knowing more about triangle GHJ, like its angles or other sides, we can't proceed further. Unless there's another relationship involving GH.

Wait, but maybe there's another triangle involving GH. For example, if we consider triangle GHJ. Suppose that triangle GHJ has sides GH, HJ=10, and GJ. But unless we have more info about angles or other sides, we can't relate GH here. So, maybe there's something missing here. Perhaps another equation involving x?

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me check if there's another angle or side that can be used. The angle at D is 2x + 4, and GD is 2x - 2. Could there be a relationship between angles in triangle GHJ and the angle at D?

Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines in triangle GDH. Let me try that. In triangle GDH:

sin(angle at G)/DH = sin(angle at D)/GH

But again, without knowing angles at G or H, this might not help. Wait, unless we can find those angles somehow. Alternatively, maybe considering that angle at D is related to other angles in triangle GHJ?

This seems too vague. Let me think again. What if there's a mistake in my initial assumption? Maybe GD isn't part of triangle GDH. Wait, no, because D is connected to G and H, forming angle at D. So yes, triangle GDH exists.

Alternatively, perhaps there's an error in assuming that GH is a side that connects to triangle GHJ. Wait, GH is a side of triangle GHJ, so GH is connected to G and H. So, in triangle GDH, we have sides GD, DH, and GH. And in triangle GHJ, sides GH, HJ, and GJ. 

But without more information about triangle GHJ, like angles or other sides, I'm stuck. Unless there's another relationship. Wait, but maybe there's an implied right triangle? For example, if angle at D is a right angle, but that's not stated. The angle is 2x + 4, which may or may not be 90 degrees. But since we don't know x, we can't assume that.

Hmm. This seems like a dead end. Maybe there's a different approach. Let me check the answer choices. They are numerical options: 10, 12, 14, 20. So GD is one of these. Since GD is expressed as 2x - 2, maybe plugging in the answer choices to find x?

For example, if GD is 10, then 2x - 2 = 10 → x = 6. Then angle at D would be 2*6 +4 = 16 degrees. Then, using Law of Cosines in triangle GDH, GH² = 10² +7² - 2*10*7*cos(16°). Let me calculate that:

GH² ≈ 100 + 49 - 140*cos(16°). Cos(16°) is approximately 0.9613, so:

GH² ≈ 149 - 140*0.9613 ≈ 149 - 134.58 ≈ 14.42 → GH ≈ sqrt(14.42) ≈ 3.8. But then, in triangle GHJ, we have HJ=10 and GH≈3.8. But without knowing anything else about triangle GHJ, like angles or other sides, this doesn't help. So maybe this approach is wrong.

Alternatively, if GD is 12 (option B), then 2x -2 = 12 → x=7. Then angle at D is 2*7 +4 = 18 degrees. Then GH² = 12² +7² - 2*12*7*cos(18°). Calculating:

GH² = 144 + 49 - 168*cos(18°). Cos(18°) ≈ 0.9511. So:

GH² ≈ 193 - 168*0.9511 ≈ 193 - 159.8 ≈ 33.2 → GH ≈ 5.76. Again, not sure how this helps.

Option C: GD=14. Then 2x -2=14 → x=8. Angle at D is 2*8 +4=20 degrees. Then GH² = 14² +7² - 2*14*7*cos(20°). Let's compute:

GH² = 196 +49 - 196*cos(20°). Cos(20°) ≈ 0.9397. So:

GH² ≈ 245 - 196*0.9397 ≈ 245 - 184.1 ≈ 60.9 → GH ≈ 7.8. Still not helpful.

Option D: GD=20 → 2x-2=20 → x=11. Angle at D: 2*11 +4=26 degrees. Then GH² = 20² +7² - 2*20*7*cos(26°). Compute:

GH² = 400 +49 - 280*cos(26°). Cos(26°) ≈ 0.8988. So:

GH² ≈ 449 - 280*0.8988 ≈ 449 - 251.66 ≈ 197.34 → GH ≈ 14.05. Still no clue.

So none of these seem to give us a way forward. Maybe there's a different approach. Wait, maybe the problem involves the Law of Cosines in triangle GHJ? Let me think. Suppose that in triangle GHJ, we can find some relationship with triangle GDH. But without knowing any angles or other sides, it's tricky.

Wait, but maybe there's a typo in the problem? Or did I misread something? Let me double-check the given predicates.

Original given:

Triangle(G,H,J)

Equals(LengthOf(Line(G,D)), 2x-2)

Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,H)), 7)

Equals(LengthOf(Line(H,J)), 10)

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(G,D,H)), 2x+4)

Point(D)

Point(G)

Point(H)

Point(J)

Ah! Wait, the angle is MeasureOf(Angle(G,D,H)), which is angle at D between G and H. So that's angle G-D-H. Which is the same as angle at D in triangle GDH. So, if we can find x such that in triangle GDH, some condition holds, possibly relating to triangle GHJ.

But how? Maybe triangle GHJ has some property that can be linked to triangle GDH. For example, if GHJ is a right triangle, but that's not given. Or maybe triangle GDH is similar to triangle GHJ? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe there's an external angle or something. Wait, if we consider that in triangle GHJ, angle at H? Let me think. If we can find angle at H in triangle GHJ, but we don't have enough info.

Alternatively, maybe the sum of angles around point D? No, because D is connected to G and H, but unless there's more points.

Wait, perhaps the key is that triangle GDH and triangle GHJ share the side GH. If we can find GH from triangle GDH, and then apply the Law of Cosines or Law of Sines in triangle GHJ. But without more information about triangle GHJ, this is impossible. Unless... there's another angle or side related to GHJ.

Wait, the problem says Triangle(G,H,J). So, triangle GHJ has sides GH, HJ=10, and GJ. But we don't know GJ or angles. So unless there's another relationship. Wait, maybe triangle GDH is part of triangle GHJ, making GH a common side. But without more information, like whether D is on a certain side or not, it's hard to say.

Wait, maybe we're supposed to assume that D lies on HJ? Or some other position? But the problem doesn't state that. Without knowing where D is located relative to triangle GHJ, it's impossible to make assumptions.

Wait, but maybe the angle at D (angle G-D-H) is supplementary to an angle in triangle GHJ? Like, if D lies on HJ extended, then angle at D could be related to angle at H. But again, without knowing where D is, it's speculative.

Hmm. This seems challenging. Let me think again. The problem gives us expressions involving x for both the length GD and the angle at D. So, perhaps there's an equation that links them. Maybe using the Law of Cosines in triangle GDH and combining it with something else.

But without knowing GH or other sides, how? Wait, unless GH is equal to something else. For example, if GH is a side of triangle GHJ, and maybe we can relate it to the other sides? Like, suppose that in triangle GHJ, HJ=10, and GH is computed from triangle GDH. But still, without knowing any other angles or sides in GHJ, we can't proceed. Unless...

Wait, maybe triangle GDH and triangle GHJ are similar? If they are similar, then ratios of sides would hold. But for similarity, we need corresponding angles. But we don't know any angles in triangle GHJ. 

Alternatively, perhaps using the Law of Cosines in both triangles? Let me try that. Let's say in triangle GDH, we have GH² = (2x-2)^2 + 7^2 - 2*(2x-2)*7*cos(2x+4). In triangle GHJ, we have HJ=10, so maybe using Law of Cosines again, but we need more information. 

Wait, unless there's another angle given. Wait, no. The only angle given is the one at D. So, maybe there's a way to link this angle with another angle in triangle GHJ? For example, if angle at H in triangle GHJ is related to the angle at D? But without knowing how D is placed, it's hard to say.

Wait, maybe there's an assumption that triangle GDH is a right triangle? Let me check. If the angle at D were 90 degrees, then cos(90) is zero, and GH² = (GD)^2 + (DH)^2. So GH = sqrt((2x-2)^2 + 7^2). But the angle is given as 2x +4. So setting 2x +4 = 90 → x=43. But substituting back, GD would be 2*43-2=84, which is not among the answer choices. So that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, maybe angle at D is complementary to another angle? Not sure.

Wait, maybe the problem expects us to realize that the angle and the length expressions are related in such a way that when combined, they allow solving for x. For example, using trigonometric identities or equations. Let me attempt to set up an equation.

From triangle GDH, GH² = (2x-2)^2 + 7^2 - 2*(2x-2)*7*cos(2x+4). Now, if we could express GH from another source, we could equate. But since GH is also a side of triangle GHJ, and we don't have information about that triangle, unless there's another equation involving GH.

Wait, but maybe triangle GHJ has a right angle? For example, if angle at G or H is right, but that's not stated. Let me assume that angle at G is right. Then, using Pythagoras: GH² + GJ² = HJ²? No, that wouldn't fit. Wait, if angle at G is right, then HJ² = GH² + GJ². But we don't know GJ. 

Alternatively, if angle at H is right, then GJ² = GH² + HJ². Again, without knowing GJ, this is not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the triangle GHJ is isoceles? For example, GH = HJ =10? If that's the case, then GH=10. So, substituting GH=10 into the earlier equation:

10² = (2x-2)^2 + 7² - 2*(2x-2)*7*cos(2x+4).

But this introduces an equation with x and cos(2x+4), which is complicated. Solving this analytically would require numerical methods or guessing x from the answer choices.

Let me try this approach. Assume GH=10 (since HJ=10, maybe GH is also 10). Then plug into the equation:

100 = (2x-2)^2 + 49 - 14*(2x-2)*cos(2x+4)

Rearranging:

(2x-2)^2 - 14*(2x-2)*cos(2x+4) = 51

Now, we can test each answer choice to see if this equation holds.

Let's try option B: GD=12 → 2x-2=12 → x=7. Then angle is 2x+4=18 degrees. Plugging into the left side:

(12)^2 -14*12*cos(18°) = 144 - 168*cos(18°). As before, cos(18°) ≈ 0.9511, so 168*0.9511 ≈ 159.8. Thus 144 - 159.8 ≈ -15.8. But the right side is 51. Not matching.

Option C: GD=14 → x=8. Angle=2*8+4=20 degrees. Left side: 14² -14*14*cos(20°)= 196 - 196*cos(20°). Cos(20°) ≈ 0.9397. 196*0.9397 ≈ 184.1. So 196 - 184.1 ≈ 11.9. Right side is 51. Not matching.

Option D: GD=20 → x=11. Angle=2*11+4=26. Left side: 20² -14*20*cos(26) = 400 - 280*cos(26). Cos(26) ≈ 0.8988 → 280*0.8988 ≈ 251.66. 400 - 251.66 ≈ 148.34. Not 51.

Option A: GD=10 → x=6. Angle=2*6+4=16 degrees. Left side: 10² -14*10*cos(16) = 100 - 140*cos(16). Cos(16) ≈ 0.9613 → 140*0.9613 ≈ 134.58. 100 - 134.58 ≈ -34.58. Not matching.

None of these work. So assuming GH=10 is incorrect.

Maybe GH is another value? Let's think differently. Since we have no other info, perhaps the problem assumes that triangle GDH is a right triangle, even though it's not stated? Let me try that.

Assume angle at D is 90 degrees. Then, 2x+4=90 → x=43. Then GD=2*43-2=84. Not in answer choices. So no.

Alternatively, maybe angle at D is 60 degrees? Then 2x+4=60 → x=28. GD=2*28-2=54. Not in choices.

Alternatively, maybe angle at D is 30 degrees? 2x+4=30 → x=13. GD=2*13-2=24. Not in choices.

This isn't working. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup? Or perhaps I missed a key insight.

Wait, looking back at the given predicates, there's a Triangle(G,H,J). So, points G, H, J form a triangle. But where is D? Maybe D is on HJ? Let me consider that possibility.

If D is on HJ, then HD is part of HJ. Given that HJ=10 and HD=7, then DJ=HJ - HD = 10 -7=3. So, D divides HJ into HD=7 and DJ=3. But how does this help?

Then, triangle GDH would have GD as one side, DH=7, and angle at D. But also, since D is on HJ, then G is connected to D and H. So, maybe triangle GDH and triangle GHD are the same. But how does this relate to triangle GHJ?

If D is on HJ, then GD is a cevian of triangle GHJ. But without knowing where G is, it's still unclear. But perhaps we can use Stewart's theorem?

Stewart's theorem relates the length of a cevian to the sides of the triangle. For triangle GHJ with cevian GD, where D divides HJ into HD=7 and DJ=3. So, applying Stewart's theorem:

GH² * DJ + GJ² * HD = HJ * (GD² + HD * DJ)

Wait, Stewart's formula is: b²m + c²n = a(d² + mn), where a is the side divided into m and n by the cevian of length d.

In this case, the triangle is GHJ, with side HJ=10, divided by D into HD=7 and DJ=3. The cevian is GD, with length GD=2x-2. So applying Stewart's theorem:

GH² * DJ + GJ² * HD = HJ * (GD² + HD * DJ)

Plugging in:

GH² * 3 + GJ² * 7 = 10 * [(2x-2)^2 + 7*3]

But we don't know GH or GJ. However, in triangle GHJ, we can use the Law of Cosines to relate GH, GJ, and HJ=10. But without knowing any angles or other sides, this still leaves us with too many variables.

Wait, but maybe we can combine this with the Law of Cosines in triangle GDH? Earlier, we had GH² = (2x-2)^2 + 7^2 - 2*(2x-2)*7*cos(2x+4). Let me call this Equation (1).

And from Stewart's theorem, we have:

3*GH² + 7*GJ² = 10[(2x-2)^2 + 21] → Equation (2).

But we still have two variables, GH and GJ. So, unless we can find another equation involving GH and GJ.

In triangle GHJ, by Law of Cosines:

GJ² = GH² + HJ² - 2*GH*HJ*cos(angle at H)

But angle at H is unknown. So, again, stuck.

Alternatively, if we assume that triangle GHJ is a right triangle, but again, no info.

This seems too convoluted. Maybe there's a simpler approach. Let me revisit the original problem.

Wait, the question is to find GD, which is 2x-2. The answer choices are numerical values. So, perhaps there's a way to find x from the given angle and length expressions, even without knowing the exact triangle configuration.

Let me consider that in triangle GDH, the angle at D is 2x+4 degrees, and the sides adjacent to it are GD=2x-2 and DH=7. Maybe there's a special relationship here, like the angle being complementary or supplementary to another angle, or using the fact that the product of slopes or something else. But without coordinates, it's difficult.

Wait, perhaps using the Law of Sines in triangle GDH. Let's try that.

Law of Sines states that in any triangle, (a/sin A) = (b/sin B) = (c/sin C).

In triangle GDH:

GD / sin(angle at H) = DH / sin(angle at G) = GH / sin(angle at D)

But we don't know angles at G or H. However, if we assume that angle at D is related to other angles in triangle GHJ, but again, no info.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the expression for the angle and the length can be solved by setting up an equation where the angle is related to the sides in a particular way. For example, if the angle is 90 degrees, but that didn't work earlier. Or maybe using some identity.

Wait, let me think numerically. Suppose that in triangle GDH, the angle at D is 2x+4, and sides GD=2x-2, DH=7. If we treat this as a system where x is a variable, maybe there's a unique x that satisfies some condition. But what condition?

Since the problem includes all these elements, maybe there's a hidden condition that allows solving for x. For example, maybe the triangle GHJ has some property that forces a specific relationship. But without knowing more about GHJ, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the key is to recognize that angle at D is supplementary to an angle in triangle GHJ. For example, if D is on HJ extended, then angle at D could be supplementary to angle at H. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves two triangles sharing a common side or angle, allowing the use of the Law of Cosines or Sines in both.

Wait, let's take a different route. Let me try to assign variables and see if I can find a relationship.

Let me denote GD = 2x - 2.

Angle at D = 2x + 4.

From triangle GDH, using Law of Cosines:

GH² = GD² + DH² - 2*GD*DH*cos(angle D)

Substituting:

GH² = (2x-2)^2 + 7^2 - 2*(2x-2)*7*cos(2x+4)

Now, in triangle GHJ, we have HJ=10. Let me assume that triangle GHJ is such that GH is related to other sides. If I could find GH from somewhere, I could substitute. But how?

Wait, if I could find GH from triangle GDH and then use it in triangle GHJ. But without more information about triangle GHJ, this is not possible. However, maybe there's an assumption that GH is equal to some value derived from other parts?

Wait, maybe the problem is missing some information, or I'm missing a key insight. Let me look at the answer choices again: 10, 12, 14, 20. These are multiples of 2, which aligns with the expression 2x-2. Let me try to see if there's a scenario where the expression for GH from triangle GDH leads to a value that fits with triangle GHJ.

Suppose that in triangle GHJ, HJ=10, and GH is computed from above. Let me try each option for GD:

Option B: GD=12 → x=7. Then angle at D=2*7+4=18 degrees.

GH² = 12² + 7² - 2*12*7*cos(18°) ≈ 144 + 49 - 168*0.9511 ≈ 193 - 159.8 ≈ 33.2 → GH ≈ 5.76.

Now, in triangle GHJ, sides GH≈5.76, HJ=10. Let's assume that GJ is another side. Using Law of Cosines again, but without knowing angles, it's hard to say. But maybe the triangle is such that GH and HJ are related in a specific way? For example, if angle at G is 90 degrees, then GJ² = GH² + HJ². But GJ would be sqrt(5.76² + 10²) ≈ sqrt(33.18 + 100) ≈ sqrt(133.18) ≈ 11.54. But this is just speculation.

Alternatively, if GH=5.76, HJ=10, and GJ is some value. But without more info, this doesn't help.

Option C: GD=14 → x=8. Angle=20 degrees. GH² = 14² + 7² - 2*14*7*cos(20°) ≈ 196 + 49 - 196*0.9397 ≈ 245 - 184.1 ≈ 60.9 → GH ≈ 7.8. Then, in triangle GHJ, HJ=10. If angle at H is such that GJ is determined, but again, no info.

Option D: GD=20 → x=11. Angle=26 degrees. GH² = 20² +7² - 2*20*7*cos(26) ≈ 400 + 49 - 280*0.8988 ≈ 449 - 251.66 ≈ 197.34 → GH ≈ 14.05. Now, in triangle GHJ, HJ=10. If GH=14.05, then using Law of Cosines, if we assume some angle, but again, no info.

Option A: GD=10 → x=6. Angle=16 degrees. GH² = 10² +7² - 2*10*7*cos(16) ≈ 100 +49 - 140*0.9613 ≈ 149 - 134.58 ≈ 14.42 → GH ≈ 3.8. 

Now, if GH=3.8, HJ=10, and assuming some relationship. For example, if triangle GHJ is such that it's a right triangle with legs GH and HJ, then GJ would be sqrt(3.8² +10²) ≈ sqrt(14.44 + 100) ≈ 10.6. But again, no way to confirm.

This suggests that without additional information, it's impossible to determine x. But since the problem provides answer choices, there must be a way. Maybe there's an implicit assumption that the triangle GHJ is a right triangle? Let's try that.

Assume triangle GHJ is right-angled at G. Then, HJ² = GH² + GJ². But we don't know GJ. Alternatively, if it's right-angled at H, then GJ² = GH² + HJ². Let's try this.

Assume right angle at H. So, GJ² = GH² + HJ².

From earlier calculations, for each option:

Option B: GH≈5.76, HJ=10 → GJ² = 5.76² + 10² ≈ 33.18 + 100 = 133.18 → GJ ≈ 11.54.

No particular significance here.

Option C: GH≈7.8, HJ=10 → GJ² = 7.8² + 10² ≈ 60.84 + 100 = 160.84 → GJ ≈ 12.68.

Still no clue.

Option D: GH≈14.05, HJ=10 → GJ² = 14.05² + 10² ≈ 197.4 + 100 = 297.4 → GJ ≈ 17.25.

No pattern.

Option A: GH≈3.8, HJ=10 → GJ² = 3.8² + 10² ≈ 14.44 + 100 = 114.44 → GJ ≈ 10.69.

Still nothing.

Perhaps the problem assumes that triangle GDH is similar to triangle GHJ? Let's explore this.

For similarity, corresponding angles must be equal. Suppose angle at D in triangle GDH corresponds to angle at H in triangle GHJ. Then, the ratio of sides would be equal.

Let me denote:

In triangle GDH: angle at D = 2x+4, sides GD=2x-2, DH=7, and GH as calculated.

In triangle GHJ: angle at H, sides GH, HJ=10, and GJ.

If they are similar, then the ratio of sides would be consistent. For example, if angle at D corresponds to angle at H, then:

GD/GH = DH/HJ = GH/GJ.

But without knowing angles or other sides, this is too vague.

Alternatively, maybe the angle at D is equal to angle at H in triangle GHJ. Let's say angle at D = angle at H. Then, in triangle GHJ, angle at H is 2x+4. Using Law of Sines in triangle GHJ:

GH / sin(angle at J) = HJ / sin(angle at G) = GJ / sin(angle at H).

But again, too many unknowns.

At this point, I'm stuck. Since the problem provides answer choices, maybe there's a trick. Let me try to think of possible values of x that make the angle and length expressions plausible.

Given that angle at D is 2x + 4. Let's assume that this angle is acute, so less than 90 degrees. So, 2x + 4 < 90 → x < 43. Also, since GD is positive, 2x - 2 > 0 → x > 1.

Possible x values from 2 to 43. But answer choices suggest x is likely small, since GD is one of 10, 12, 14, 20. Let's try x=7 (option B: GD=12). Then angle at D is 18 degrees, which is plausible. Let me see if there's a way to link this with triangle GHJ.

If x=7, then GD=12, DH=7, angle at D=18 degrees. Let's compute GH using Law of Cosines:

GH² = 12² + 7² - 2*12*7*cos(18) ≈ 144 + 49 - 168*0.9511 ≈ 193 - 159.8 ≈ 33.2 → GH ≈ 5.76.

Now, in triangle GHJ, with HJ=10, and GH≈5.76. If we assume that this triangle is such that GH is a leg and HJ is hypotenuse, then it would be a right triangle. Let's check if 5.76² + GJ² = 10². But GJ is unknown. Alternatively, if GH is the hypotenuse, then GJ² + 5.76² = 10² → GJ² = 100 - 33.18 = 66.82 → GJ ≈ 8.17. But this is arbitrary.

Alternatively, maybe the triangle GHJ has sides GH=5.76, HJ=10, and GJ=something. But without additional info, this doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting us to use the fact that in triangle GDH, the angle and sides satisfy some condition that allows solving for x, even without knowing the full triangle. For example, if the triangle is such that the angle is related to the sides in a specific way, like the angle being 30, 45, 60, etc., but this requires guessing.

Let me try x=7 (option B), angle=18 degrees. Is there a special triangle with sides 12, 7, and angle 18 degrees? Not particularly. 

Try x=8 (option C): angle=20 degrees, GD=14. Let's compute GH:

GH² = 14² + 7² - 2*14*7*cos(20) ≈ 196 + 49 - 196*0.9397 ≈ 245 - 184.1 ≈ 60.9 → GH ≈ 7.8. Now, if GH=7.8, and HJ=10, maybe this forms a triangle with some special property? Like, if GH=7.8, HJ=10, and GJ= something. Again, no.

Wait, what if the problem is designed so that the angle and the length expressions lead to a quadratic equation that can be solved? Let me try to derive such an equation.

From the Law of Cosines in triangle GDH:

GH² = (2x-2)^2 + 7^2 - 2*(2x-2)*7*cos(2x+4).

But we need another equation involving GH. Let's assume that in triangle GHJ, using the Law of Cosines, we can relate GH to other sides. But without knowing any angles or other sides, this is not possible. Hence, this approach is blocked.

Wait, but perhaps the problem assumes that triangle GHJ is such that GH is equal to HJ? If GH=10, then we can set up the equation:

10² = (2x-2)^2 + 7^2 - 2*(2x-2)*7*cos(2x+4).

As before, this gives:

100 = (2x-2)^2 + 49 - 14*(2x-2)*cos(2x+4)

Rearrange:

(2x-2)^2 - 14*(2x-2)*cos(2x+4) = 51.

Now, let's try each answer choice for x:

Option B: x=7 → 2x-2=12. Plug in:

12^2 - 14*12*cos(18) = 144 - 168*cos(18) ≈ 144 - 168*0.9511 ≈ 144 - 159.8 ≈ -15.8 ≠ 51. No.

Option C: x=8 → 2x-2=14. So:

14^2 - 14*14*cos(20) = 196 - 196*cos(20) ≈ 196 - 196*0.9397 ≈ 196 - 184.1 ≈ 11.9 ≠ 51. No.

Option D: x=11 → 2x-2=20. So:

20^2 - 14*20*cos(26) = 400 - 280*cos(26) ≈ 400 - 280*0.8988 ≈ 400 - 251.66 ≈ 148.34 ≠ 51. No.

Option A: x=6 → 2x-2=10. So:

10^2 - 14*10*cos(16) = 100 - 140*cos(16) ≈ 100 - 140*0.9613 ≈ 100 - 134.58 ≈ -34.58 ≠ 51. No.

None of these work. So this assumption is invalid.

At this point, I've exhausted all approaches I can think of, and none seem to yield a valid solution. Since the problem provides answer choices, and the only way to proceed is to assume that there's an error in my reasoning, I'll have to reconsider.

Wait, maybe the problem is not about triangle GDH, but about triangle GHD, and there's a typo? Or perhaps the angle is at G instead of D? Let me recheck the given predicates.

The angle is MeasureOf(Angle(G,D,H)), which is the angle at D between G and H. So it's angle G-D-H, which is at D. Correct.

Another thought: maybe the problem uses the Law of Cosines in a way that combines with the Law of Cosines in another triangle, leading to an equation solvable for x. For example, if there's another triangle involving GHJ and GDH.

Wait, suppose that in triangle GHJ, angle at H is equal to angle at D in triangle GDH. Let's say angle at H = 2x+4. Then, using Law of Sines in triangle GHJ:

GH / sin(angle at J) = HJ / sin(angle at G) = GJ / sin(angle at H).

But without knowing angles at G or J, this is still too many variables.

Alternatively, if angle at H is equal to angle at D, and using Law of Sines in both triangles.

In triangle GDH: GD / sin(angle at H) = DH / sin(angle at G) = GH / sin(angle at D)

In triangle GHJ: GH / sin(angle at J) = HJ / sin(angle at G) = GJ / sin(angle at H)

But this seems too abstract.

At this point, I'm forced to conclude that either there's missing information in the problem, or I'm missing a key insight. Given the time I've spent without success, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the answer choices and possible patterns.

Looking at the answer choices, and the expression for GD as 2x-2, if I assume that x is an integer, then GD is even. The options are 10, 12, 14, 20. All even numbers. Let me try x=7 (GD=12), x=8 (GD=14), x=11 (GD=20), or x=6 (GD=10).

If I assume that the angle at D is 30 degrees, then 2x+4=30 → x=13, which would make GD=24, not in choices. 

If angle is 45 degrees, 2x+4=45 → x=20.5, GD=2*20.5-2=39, not in choices.

If angle is 60 degrees, x=28, GD=54.

Not helpful.

Wait, what if the angle at D is 60 degrees, and using the Law of Cosines in triangle GDH with x=28, but this gives GD=54, which is not an option.

Alternatively, maybe the angle at D is such that cos(2x+4) is rational, like 0.5, 0, 1, etc.

For example, if cos(2x+4) = 0.5, then 2x+4=60 or 300 degrees. Let's try 60 degrees: 2x+4=60 → x=28
