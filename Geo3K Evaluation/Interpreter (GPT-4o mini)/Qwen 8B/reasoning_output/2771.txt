<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse the given predicates and see how they relate to each other. 

So, we have four equations involving the lengths of different line segments. Let me list them out again:

1. Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,D)), 6x + 4)
2. Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), 10x - 2)
3. Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,E)), 5x + 10)
4. Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,A)), LengthOf(Line(C,E)))
5. Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,E)), LengthOf(Line(C,A)))

The question asks us to solve for x. The answer choices are A. 3, B. 22, C. 25, D. 28.

Hmm, okay. So these are all expressions in terms of x. But since there are multiple variables here, maybe some of these lengths are connected through geometric relationships? Like triangles or something?

Wait, the problem mentions a figure, but since it's not provided, I have to infer the relationships based on the given equalities. Let me think about how these lines could be connected. For example, Line(D,A) equals Line(C,E), and Line(D,E) equals Line(C,A). That suggests that maybe points form some kind of triangle or quadrilateral where sides are equal?

Let me try to visualize. Suppose there's a triangle or quadrilateral involving points A, C, D, E. Maybe triangle CDE and another triangle? Or perhaps two triangles sharing a common side?

Alternatively, maybe there are triangles where certain sides are equal. Let me consider the equalities one by one.

First, the fourth predicate says Length(DA) = Length(CE). The fifth says Length(DE) = Length(CA). So DA = CE and DE = CA. If I can find relationships between these segments, maybe triangles involved?

Suppose there's a triangle where DA and CE are corresponding sides, and DE and CA are others. Wait, maybe triangles CEA and DEA? Not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe considering triangles that share sides. Let me try to assign variables to the lengths.

Let me denote:

Let’s define variables for each length:

CD = 6x + 4  
AB = 10x - 2  
FE = 5x + 10  
DA = CE  
DE = CA  

But AB isn't directly connected to the others unless there's more info. Hmm.

Wait, maybe points A, B, C, D, E, F form some figure. Since FE is mentioned, maybe there's a triangle involving F? But without seeing the figure, it's tricky. However, the key equalities involve DA, CE, DE, CA. Let me focus on those.

From the fourth equality: DA = CE. From the fifth: DE = CA. So if I look at triangle CDA and triangle... wait, suppose we consider triangle CDA and triangle ECA? Let me check:

In triangle CDA, sides CD, DA, and CA. In triangle ECA, sides EC, CA, and EA. But DA = EC (from the fourth equality), and DE = CA (fifth equality). Wait, DE is part of triangle CDE? Maybe.

Alternatively, maybe triangles CDE and CDA? Let me think:

In triangle CDE, sides CD, DE, CE. We know CD = 6x +4, DE = CA, and CE = DA. Also, in triangle CDA, sides CD, DA, CA. So if we can relate these triangles somehow.

But how? Unless there's some congruence or similarity. If two triangles have two sides equal and included angles equal, they would be congruent. But I don't know the angles.

Alternatively, maybe the triangles are congruent. If triangle CDE ≅ triangle CDA? Let's see:

For congruence, we need corresponding sides equal. Suppose CD corresponds to CD? Not sure. Alternatively, if CD = CE (but CD is 6x+4 and CE is DA, which is same as CE = DA. So CD = DA? Wait, not necessarily. Because CD is 6x +4, and DA is equal to CE. But CE is a different segment. So unless DA equals CD, which would mean 6x +4 = DA. But DA is equal to CE, so CE = 6x +4. But CE is also a length in another equation? Not sure.

Wait, maybe I should write down all equations:

Let me note:

Let’s denote:

CD = 6x +4  
AB = 10x -2  
FE = 5x +10  
DA = CE → DA = CE  
DE = CA → DE = CA  

Now, if I can express DA, DE, CA in terms of x, maybe I can set up equations.

But how do I relate DA, DE, and CA to other variables?

Well, CA is the length of Line(C,A). Is CA related to any other segment? For instance, if CA is part of another line, like CA could be the same as AB or something else? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle where CA is a side. For example, triangle ABC? If points A, B, C are connected. Then AB is given as 10x -2, BC and AC would be other sides. But without knowing the structure, it's hard to tell.

Wait, but maybe we can use the fact that DE = CA. So DE is a segment whose length is equal to CA. If DE is part of another line, say, D-E, then DE = CA. Similarly, DA = CE.

This seems to suggest that triangles CDE and CEA may have some relationship. Let me explore that.

Consider triangle CDE and triangle CEA. If we can find relations between their sides.

In triangle CDE:

Side CD = 6x +4  
Side DE = CA (unknown, but let's call it y for now)  
Side CE = DA (which is equal to CE, so CE is DA)

In triangle CEA:

Side CE = DA (same as above)  
Side CA = DE (from the fifth equality)  
Side EA = ?

Wait, if triangle CDE and triangle CEA have two sides equal: CD = CE (if CD equals CE?), but CD is 6x +4, and CE is DA. So if CD = CE, then 6x +4 = DA. But DA is equal to CE, which is the same as DA. So that would imply CD = DA. Which would make CD = DA. So CD = DA implies 6x +4 = DA. But DA is CE, which is another segment. But unless there's more info, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, maybe triangle CDE is congruent to triangle CEA via SSS or SAS.

If CD = CE (so 6x +4 = CE), and DE = CA (so DE = CA), and maybe another side?

Wait, in triangle CDE, the third side is CE, which is DA. And in triangle CEA, the third side is EA. So unless EA equals something else...

This seems too vague. Maybe I need to consider another approach.

Let me think: since there are multiple expressions with x, perhaps combining the equations. But how?

We have five expressions, but only three variables: x, and the lengths of DA, DE, CA. But maybe we can express everything in terms of x.

Wait, DA = CE. So CE = DA. But CE is a length; if I can express CE in terms of x, but I don't have a direct expression for CE. Unless CE is part of another segment.

Similarly, DE = CA. So DE is equal to CA. Again, CA is another length. So maybe CA can be expressed in terms of other segments?

Wait, if I assume that CA is part of triangle ABC. Then AB is given as 10x -2, and CA could be another side. But without knowing if ABC is a right triangle or anything, I can't relate AB and CA directly.

Alternatively, maybe CA is the same as CD or something else? Not sure.

Wait, but maybe the key lies in the first three expressions. Let me check:

CD = 6x +4  
AB = 10x -2  
FE = 5x +10  

These are separate, but maybe they are parts of larger structures. However, since the problem involves multiple lines, perhaps there's a way to link them.

Wait, but the main equalities are between DA, CE, DE, CA. Let me focus on those.

So DA = CE  
DE = CA  

So if I can express DA and DE in terms of x, maybe I can relate them.

But DA is Length(DA), which is equal to CE. How can I get CE?

Unless CE is part of another line. For example, if there's a line CE, and maybe it's connected to another point. But without knowing the figure, it's challenging.

Wait, but maybe there's a triangle where CE is a side. For example, triangle CEF? If F is connected to E, then FE is given as 5x +10. So FE is part of that triangle.

Alternatively, if CE is connected to E, then FE is adjacent to CE. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, think of points C, E, F forming a triangle with FE = 5x +10, but CE is another side. But unless there's more info, I can't connect that.

Maybe I'm missing something. Let me try to think differently. Since the problem gives us several equalities, maybe there's a system of equations we can set up.

Let me consider that DA = CE and DE = CA. Let me denote:

Let’s call DA = CE = m  
And DE = CA = n  

So we have:

CD = 6x +4  
DA = m  
DE = n  
CA = n  

Also, FE = 5x +10. 

But how does FE come into play? Unless FE is connected to other segments. For example, if F is connected to E and to another point, making a triangle or something. But without more info, it's unclear.

Wait, maybe there's a triangle involving points C, E, and F? If FE is a side, then CE is another side, and CF could be another. But again, not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe triangle DEF? If DE = n, EF = 5x +10, DF could be another side. But again, no connection to other variables.

Hmm. This seems stuck. Let me go back to the original equalities. Are there any other equalities that can be used?

Wait, maybe there's a triangle where CA is a side, and DE is equal to CA. So DE = CA. If I can find expressions for DE and CA in terms of x.

But how? Let me think: CA is the length from C to A. If I can express CA in terms of other segments. For example, if CA is part of triangle ABC, then AB is 10x -2, and CA could be found if we had more info. But without knowing angles or other sides, it's impossible.

Alternatively, maybe CA is equal to CD? No, unless there's a reason.

Wait, maybe there's a parallelogram or something where opposite sides are equal. For example, if CD is equal to AE or something. But again, not enough info.

Wait, but earlier, we had DA = CE and DE = CA. So if I imagine quadrilateral CEDA, where CD and CE are sides, and DA and DE are other sides. Wait, if CEDA is a quadrilateral, then CD and CE would be adjacent sides, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe a triangle with points C, D, E, and A?

Alternatively, think of triangle CDE and triangle DAE? Not sure.

Wait, in triangle CDE, sides are CD, DE, CE. From earlier, CD = 6x +4, DE = CA, CE = DA. So if we can find another relation between these sides, maybe using triangle inequality or something else. But without angles, it's hard to use that.

Alternatively, maybe triangle CDE has sides CD, DE, CE, and triangle DAE has sides DA, AE, DE. But DA = CE, DE is common, so maybe those triangles are congruent? If DA = CE and DE is common, and if angle between CD and DE equals angle between CE and DA? Not sure.

This feels too vague. Let me try another approach. Perhaps the key is that DA = CE and DE = CA, which might imply some sort of congruency or similarity between triangles.

Suppose triangles CDA and CED are congruent? Let me check:

Triangle CDA has sides CD, DA, CA. Triangle CED has sides CE, ED, CD. Wait, CE = DA, ED = CA, and CD is common. So if CD is common, and CE = DA, ED = CA, then triangles CDA and CED are congruent by SSS. Therefore, corresponding angles would be equal.

Therefore, angle CDA equals angle CED, and angle DCA equals angle ECD, etc. But how does this help us?

Well, if the triangles are congruent, then maybe other relationships hold. But I still don't see how to relate this to the x variable.

Wait, but if triangles CDA and CED are congruent, then their perimeters are equal. Let me calculate perimeter of triangle CDA and CED.

Perimeter of CDA: CD + DA + CA = (6x +4) + DA + CA  
Perimeter of CED: CE + ED + CD = DA + CA + CD (since CE=DA, ED=CA, CD is same as before).

So perimeters are equal, which is obvious because they are congruent. Doesn't give new info.

Hmm. What else? Let me think about the other given lengths. There's AB = 10x -2 and FE = 5x +10. These aren't directly connected to the other equalities unless there's more structure.

Wait, maybe AB and FE are parts of the same figure. For example, if AB is a side of a triangle connected to FE? But again, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe AB is connected to CA or something else. For example, if A is connected to B and C, forming triangle ABC. Then AB is 10x -2, and CA is n (from earlier). But without more info, I can't relate AB to CA.

Wait, but maybe using triangle inequalities? For example, in triangle ABC, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But again, without knowing which sides, it's hard to apply.

Alternatively, maybe AB is part of a larger structure. For example, if AB is parallel to FE or something? But no info on angles or slopes.

At this point, I feel like I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the given predicates carefully.

Given:

1. CD = 6x +4  
2. AB = 10x -2  
3. FE = 5x +10  
4. DA = CE  
5. DE = CA  

Is there a possibility that these segments form a polygon or have overlapping points? For example, maybe points C, D, A, E are arranged in a way that creates a closed shape?

If I consider quadrilateral CDAE, with sides CD, DA, AE, and EC. But then DA = CE and DE = CA. Wait, DE is a diagonal? Or is DE a side?

If DE is a side, then in quadrilateral CDAE, sides CD, DA, AE, EC. But DE would be a diagonal connecting D and E. However, DE is equal to CA. So CA is the length of another side. Maybe?

Alternatively, maybe triangle CDE and triangle CEA have some relations. As previously thought.

Wait, if DE = CA and DA = CE, then in triangle CDE, sides CD, DE, CE. And in triangle CEA, sides CE, CA, EA. If DE = CA and DA = CE, then maybe triangle CDE is congruent to triangle EAC? Let me check:

In triangle CDE: CD, DE, CE  
In triangle EAC: EC, CA, EA  

If CD = EA, DE = CA, and CE = EC, then by SSS, the triangles would be congruent. But we know DE = CA and DA = CE. So if CD = EA, then yes. But how do we know CD equals EA?

Unless there's some other relationship. For example, if EA is equal to CD, which is 6x +4. But I don't have info on EA.

This seems to be going in circles. Maybe I need to find another way.

Wait, let me think: All the given equalities are in terms of x. The question is to solve for x. So maybe there's a way to combine these equations to eliminate variables.

Let me try to set up equations based on the relationships.

From DA = CE and DE = CA, let's denote:

Let’s say DA = CE = m  
DE = CA = n  

Then, we have:

CD = 6x +4  
DA = m  
DE = n  
CA = n  

But how to relate m and n to x? Maybe using triangle relations?

For example, in triangle CDA, sides are CD, DA, CA. So CD = 6x +4, DA = m, CA = n. By triangle inequality, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. So:

CD + DA > CA → 6x +4 + m > n  
CD + CA > DA → 6x +4 + n > m  
DA + CA > CD → m + n > 6x +4  

But without knowing m and n, this might not help directly.

Alternatively, if there's another triangle where these sides are involved. For example, if triangle CDE has sides CD = 6x +4, DE = n, and CE = m. Then applying triangle inequality again:

CD + DE > CE → 6x +4 + n > m  
CD + CE > DE → 6x +4 + m > n  
DE + CE > CD → n + m > 6x +4  

Same as before. Still not helpful.

Wait, but maybe there's a relation between m and n? For instance, if we assume that triangles CDA and CDE are congruent, then m = DE, n = DA? Not sure.

Alternatively, if there's a right triangle somewhere. For example, if triangle CDA is a right triangle, then Pythagorean theorem applies. But again, no info on angles.

Wait, but maybe the key is that the expressions for CD, DA, DE, CA, and FE are all linear in x, and there's a way to set up equations by assuming some geometric condition. For example, if FE is the hypotenuse of a right triangle involving other segments.

But how? Let me think. If FE is part of a right triangle, say, with legs FE and something else. But without knowing the structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, but maybe FE is connected to other segments. For example, if F is connected to E and to another point, forming a triangle with FE as one side. If that triangle is right-angled, then maybe we can use Pythagoras.

But again, without knowing which sides are perpendicular, this is speculative.

Alternatively, maybe FE is part of a triangle where other sides are expressed in terms of x. For example, if FE is the base of a triangle with height something, but again, no info.

I'm stuck. Maybe I need to consider that all the given expressions are part of a single equation or system. For example, if there's a scenario where multiple expressions are equal due to geometric constraints.

Wait, what if all the lengths are parts of the same triangle or figure? For example, if AB, CD, FE are sides of a triangle, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the entire figure is made up of multiple triangles where the lengths are interconnected.

Wait, here's an idea: Suppose that points A, B, C, D, E, F form a hexagon, and the given line segments are its sides. But without knowing the order, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, think of a star-shaped figure with intersecting lines. But again, too vague.

Another thought: Since DA = CE and DE = CA, maybe there's a translation or rotation symmetry. For example, if translating point C to D and point A to E, but that requires more assumptions.

Alternatively, maybe the figure is symmetric. For example, if reflecting over a line swaps points C and D, A and E. But again, speculation.

Alternatively, think of vectors. If vector DA equals vector CE, and vector DE equals vector CA. But this requires knowledge of coordinates, which we don't have.

Wait, maybe assigning coordinates to points to model the relationships. Let me try that.

Let me place point C at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, let's assign coordinates to other points based on the given lengths.

Let’s say:

Point C is at (0,0).  
Line CD has length 6x +4, so let's put point D at (6x +4, 0).  
Now, DA = CE. Let me assume that point A is somewhere such that DA is equal to CE. But CE is the distance from C(0,0) to E. So if I can define E such that CE = DA.  
Also, DE = CA. Let's denote CA as the distance from C(0,0) to A. Let's say point A has coordinates (a,b), then CA = sqrt(a² + b²).  
Then, DE is the distance from D(6x +4, 0) to E. But E is a point such that CE = DA. Let me think: DA is the distance from D(6x +4, 0) to A(a,b), which is sqrt[(a - (6x +4))² + (b - 0)²]. So DA = sqrt[(a - 6x -4)^2 + b^2].  
And CE = distance from C(0,0) to E, which is sqrt(e_x² + e_y²), where E is (e_x, e_y).  
So from DA = CE: sqrt[(a - 6x -4)^2 + b^2] = sqrt(e_x² + e_y²). Squaring both sides: (a - 6x -4)^2 + b^2 = e_x² + e_y².  
Also, DE = CA: DE is the distance from D(6x +4, 0) to E(e_x, e_y): sqrt[(e_x - (6x +4))² + (e_y - 0)^2] = sqrt[(e_x - 6x -4)^2 + e_y^2].  
CA is sqrt(a² + b²). So setting DE = CA: sqrt[(e_x - 6x -4)^2 + e_y^2] = sqrt(a² + b²). Squaring: (e_x - 6x -4)^2 + e_y^2 = a² + b^2.  

So now we have two equations:

1. (a - 6x -4)^2 + b^2 = e_x² + e_y²  
2. (e_x - 6x -4)^2 + e_y^2 = a² + b^2  

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2:

[(e_x - 6x -4)^2 + e_y^2] - [(a - 6x -4)^2 + b^2] = (a² + b^2) - (e_x² + e_y²)

Expanding left side:

[e_x² - 2*e_x*(6x +4) + (6x +4)^2 + e_y^2] - [a² - 2*a*(6x +4) + (6x +4)^2 + b^2]

Wait, expanding (e_x - 6x -4)^2 = e_x² - 2e_x(6x +4) + (6x +4)^2  
Similarly, (a - 6x -4)^2 = a² - 2a(6x +4) + (6x +4)^2  

So substituting back:

Left side becomes:

[e_x² - 2e_x(6x +4) + (6x +4)^2 + e_y^2] - [a² - 2a(6x +4) + (6x +4)^2 + b^2]  
= e_x² - 2e_x(6x +4) + (6x +4)^2 + e_y^2 - a² + 2a(6x +4) - (6x +4)^2 - b^2  
Simplify: e_x² + e_y^2 - 2e_x(6x +4) - a² - b^2 + 2a(6x +4)  

Right side: a² + b^2 - e_x² - e_y^2  

So equating left and right:

e_x² + e_y^2 - 2e_x(6x +4) - a² - b^2 + 2a(6x +4) = a² + b^2 - e_x² - e_y^2  

Bring all terms to left:

e_x² + e_y^2 - 2e_x(6x +4) - a² - b^2 + 2a(6x +4) - a² - b^2 + e_x² + e_y^2 = 0  
Wait, no. Let me re-express:

Original equation after subtraction:

Left side = Right side  
So:

e_x² + e_y^2 - 2e_x(6x +4) - a² - b^2 + 2a(6x +4) = a² + b^2 - e_x² - e_y^2  

Move all terms to left:

e_x² + e_y^2 - 2e_x(6x +4) - a² - b^2 + 2a(6x +4) - a² - b^2 + e_x² + e_y^2 = 0  

Wait, this seems messy. Let me simplify step by step.

Starting from:

Left side: e_x² + e_y^2 - 2e_x(6x +4) - a² - b^2 + 2a(6x +4)  
equals Right side: a² + b^2 - e_x² - e_y^2  

Bringing all terms to left:

Left side - Right side = 0  
=> [e_x² + e_y^2 - 2e_x(6x +4) - a² - b^2 + 2a(6x +4)] - [a² + b^2 - e_x² - e_y^2] = 0  
Expand:  
e_x² + e_y^2 - 2e_x(6x +4) - a² - b^2 + 2a(6x +4) - a² - b^2 + e_x² + e_y^2 = 0  
Combine like terms:  
2e_x² + 2e_y^2 - 2e_x(6x +4) - 2a² - 2b^2 + 2a(6x +4) = 0  
Divide both sides by 2:  
e_x² + e_y^2 - e_x(6x +4) - a² - b^2 + a(6x +4) = 0  

Now, recall from equation 1: e_x² + e_y^2 = (a - 6x -4)^2 + b^2  
Substitute that into the equation:  
[(a - 6x -4)^2 + b^2] - e_x(6x +4) - a² - b^2 + a(6x +4) = 0  
Simplify:  
(a - 6x -4)^2 + b^2 - e_x(6x +4) - a² - b^2 + a(6x +4) = 0  
Cancel b^2:  
(a - 6x -4)^2 - e_x(6x +4) - a² + a(6x +4) = 0  

Expand (a - 6x -4)^2:  
= a² - 2a(6x +4) + (6x +4)^2 - e_x(6x +4) - a² + a(6x +4)  
Simplify:  
The a² cancels with -a².  
Remaining: -2a(6x +4) + (6x +4)^2 - e_x(6x +4) + a(6x +4)  
Combine terms:  
[-2a(6x +4) + a(6x +4)] + (6x +4)^2 - e_x(6x +4)  
= -a(6x +4) + (6x +4)^2 - e_x(6x +4)  
Factor out (6x +4):  
(6x +4)(-a + 6x +4 - e_x) = 0  

So either 6x +4 = 0 or -a + 6x +4 - e_x = 0.

Since x is a positive real number (as it's multiplied by positive coefficients in the length expressions), 6x +4 ≠ 0. So we have:

-a + 6x +4 - e_x = 0 => e_x = -a + 6x +4.

So we've found a relationship between e_x and a.

Now, recall that from equation 1: e_x² + e_y^2 = (a - 6x -4)^2 + b^2  
But we also have DE = CA. Earlier, DE = CA means that the distance from D to E equals CA. CA is sqrt(a² + b²). So DE = sqrt(a² + b²). Squared: DE² = a² + b². But DE is also the distance from D(6x +4, 0) to E(e_x, e_y):

DE² = (e_x - (6x +4))^2 + e_y^2 = a² + b^2.

So:

(e_x - 6x -4)^2 + e_y^2 = a² + b^2.  

But from equation 1: e_x² + e_y^2 = (a - 6x -4)^2 + b^2.  

So let me subtract equation 1 from DE² equation:

[(e_x - 6x -4)^2 + e_y^2] - [e_x² + e_y^2] = (a² + b^2) - [(a - 6x -4)^2 + b^2]  
Left side: expand (e_x - 6x -4)^2 - e_x²  
= e_x² - 2e_x(6x +4) + (6x +4)^2 - e_x²  
= -2e_x(6x +4) + (6x +4)^2  
Right side: a² + b^2 - (a² - 2a(6x +4) + (6x +4)^2) - b^2  
= a² + b^2 - a² + 2a(6x +4) - (6x +4)^2 - b^2  
= 2a(6x +4) - (6x +4)^2  

Thus:

-2e_x(6x +4) + (6x +4)^2 = 2a(6x +4) - (6x +4)^2  

Bring all terms to left:

-2e_x(6x +4) + (6x +4)^2 - 2a(6x +4) + (6x +4)^2 = 0  
Combine like terms:  
-2e_x(6x +4) - 2a(6x +4) + 2(6x +4)^2 = 0  
Factor out -2(6x +4):  
-2(6x +4)(e_x + a) + 2(6x +4)^2 = 0  
Divide both sides by 2(6x +4) (assuming 6x +4 ≠ 0, which it isn't):  
-(e_x + a) + (6x +4) = 0  
→ -(e_x + a) + 6x +4 = 0  
→ e_x + a = 6x +4  
→ e_x = 6x +4 - a  

Which matches our previous result from earlier: e_x = -a + 6x +4. So this confirms consistency.

Now, this tells us that e_x = 6x +4 - a. So we have a relationship between e_x and a. But how does this help us find x?

We need more information. Let me recall that we also have FE = 5x +10. FE is the length from F to E. But we haven't defined point F yet. So unless there's more info about F, it's difficult.

Wait, but maybe FE is related to other segments? For example, if F is connected to other points. Let me think: If FE is a side of a triangle or part of a figure, but without knowing, it's hard to say. However, since FE is given as 5x +10, and we have expressions involving x from other segments, maybe we can find a relationship.

But how? Let me think: If there's a triangle involving F, E, and another point. For example, if F is connected to E and to C, making triangle FEC. Then FE = 5x +10, EC = DA = m, and FC could be another length. But again, without knowing FC, it's hard to relate.

Alternatively, if FE is part of a right triangle with legs FE and something else. For example, if FE is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs FE and something else. But without knowing, it's hard.

Wait, but maybe FE is connected to other segments through the same x. For example, if FE is part of a triangle with sides involving AB or CD. But I need to find a way to relate FE to other expressions.

Alternatively, maybe all the given expressions are parts of the same equation. For example, if FE = CD + DE or something. Let me check:

If FE = 5x +10, and CD = 6x +4, DE = CA = n. If FE = CD + DE, then 5x +10 = 6x +4 + n → n = -x +6. But n is CA, which is a length, so it must be positive. So -x +6 > 0 → x <6. But looking at answer choices, x is likely larger than 6, so this might not hold.

Alternatively, FE = AB + something. AB is 10x -2. If FE = AB + CD, then 5x +10 = 10x -2 + 6x +4 → 5x +10 = 16x +2 → -11x = -8 → x = 8/11, which is around 0.7, not matching answer choices. So probably wrong assumption.

Alternatively, FE is the difference between CD and DE. 5x +10 = CD - DE → 5x +10 = 6x +4 - n → n = x -6. But again, n must be positive, so x >6. Possible, but how to find x?

But without knowing n, this is still not helpful.

Wait, but we have from earlier that e_x = 6x +4 - a. And from equation 1, e_x² + e_y^2 = (a - 6x -4)^2 + b^2. Let me substitute e_x = 6x +4 - a into this equation.

So, e_x = 6x +4 - a → e_x = -a + 6x +4.

Plug into e_x² + e_y^2 = (a - 6x -4)^2 + b^2:

(-a + 6x +4)^2 + e_y^2 = (a - 6x -4)^2 + b^2  

Note that (-a + 6x +4)^2 = (a - 6x -4)^2. So this simplifies to:

(a - 6x -4)^2 + e_y^2 = (a - 6x -4)^2 + b^2 → e_y^2 = b^2 → e_y = ±b.

So, this implies that the y-coordinate of E is equal to ±b. So point E has coordinates (e_x, ±b), where e_x = 6x +4 - a.

Now, what else can we do with this? Well, if we can find another equation relating a and b, or relate to other parts of the figure.

But we also have the length AB = 10x -2. AB is the distance between A(a, b) and B. But we don't know where B is. Without knowing B's coordinates, it's hard to proceed.

However, maybe B is connected to other points. For example, if B is connected to A and C, forming triangle ABC. But without more info, it's still uncertain.

Alternatively, since we're dealing with multiple variables (a, b, e_x, e_y), and we have FE = 5x +10, which involves point F. But we don't know where F is.

This seems to be leading me nowhere. Maybe I need to consider that all the given expressions are parts of the same equation, and the only way to solve for x is to find a relationship that allows substitution.

Wait, let me revisit the earlier conclusion: e_x = 6x +4 - a. And from DE = CA, which gave us this relationship. Now, if I can find another equation involving a and x, maybe from other parts of the figure.

But I don't have information about point B or F. However, AB is given as 10x -2. If I assume that point B is related to other points, maybe through a coordinate system.

Assume that point B is somewhere on the plane. For example, if AB is a horizontal or vertical line, but without knowing, it's hard. Alternatively, if AB is connected to other segments.

Alternatively, maybe AB is part of a triangle with CA or something else. For example, if AB and CA are sides of a triangle, then using the law of cosines or something. But again, without angles, it's hard.

Wait, but maybe AB is part of a right triangle with legs AB and CA, giving hypotenuse BC. But again, no info.

Alternatively, if AB is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs AB and something else. But without knowing, it's impossible.

At this point, I think I'm missing crucial information about the figure. Without knowing how the points are connected, it's very difficult to establish relationships between the lengths. Given that, maybe there's a standard configuration or a common geometric setup that I'm not considering.

Wait, the problem mentions "the figure," which suggests that it's a standard diagram, possibly involving triangles or other polygons. Given the equalities, maybe it's a trapezoid or a kite?

Alternatively, think of a triangle where certain sides are equal. For example, if triangle CDE is isosceles with CD = DE or something. But CD is 6x +4, DE is CA, which is n. So if CD = DE, then 6x +4 = CA. But CA is equal to DE, which is n. So this would mean CA = 6x +4. But how does this help?

If CA = 6x +4, then DE = 6x +4. Also, DA = CE. But I don't know CE.

Alternatively, if DA = CE and DE = CA, then if I assume that DA = DE, then CE = DE, implying CA = DE = DA. So CA = DA. So CA = DA. But DA is the distance from D to A, and CA is the distance from C to A. So if CA = DA, then point A is equidistant from C and D, implying it lies on the perpendicular bisector of CD.

But CD is from C(0,0) to D(6x +4, 0), so midpoint is at (3x +2, 0). So point A lies on the perpendicular bisector, which is the line x = 3x +2? No, wait, the perpendicular bisector of CD (which is horizontal) would be the vertical line passing through the midpoint. So x-coordinate is 3x +2? No, the midpoint of CD is at ((6x +4)/2, 0) = (3x +2, 0). So the perpendicular bisector is the line x = 3x +2? No, that would be a constant x-coordinate. Wait, no: the perpendicular bisector of a horizontal line segment is a vertical line through its midpoint. So the equation is x = 3x +2? No, that can't be. Wait, x-coordinate of midpoint is (6x +4)/2 = 3x + 2. So the perpendicular bisector is x = 3x +2? No, that would mean x = 3x +2, which would imply -2x = 2 → x = -1, which is a fixed value. But x is a variable here, representing a scalar. This suggests confusion in notation.

Wait, I think I confused variables here. Let me clarify: In my coordinate system, point C is at (0,0), point D is at (6x +4, 0). The midpoint of CD is at ((6x +4)/2, 0). The perpendicular bisector is the line x = (6x +4)/2, which is a vertical line. So any point A on this line satisfies x-coordinate (6x +4)/2. So if point A is on this line, then its coordinates are ((6x +4)/2, y), and CA = DA.

But CA is the distance from C(0,0) to A((6x +4)/2, y): sqrt[ ((6x +4)/2)^2 + y^2 ]  
DA is the distance from D(6x +4, 0) to A((6x +4)/2, y): sqrt[ ((6x +4)/2)^2 + y^2 ]  
So indeed, CA = DA. So this would satisfy CA = DA. But how does this help with the rest?

If CA = DA, then DE = CA = DA. So DE = DA. So DE = DA. But DE is the distance from D to E, and DA is the distance from D to A. So if DE = DA, then point E lies on the circle centered at D with radius DA. But we also have DA = CE. So CE = DA = DE. So CE = DE.

So in this case, point E is such that CE = DE. So E lies on the perpendicular bisector of CD, just like A. Wait, no: CE = DE implies E is on the perpendicular bisector of CD. So E lies on the perpendicular bisector of CD, which is the line x = (6x +4)/2. But this is getting complicated.

But if both A and E lie on the perpendicular bisector of CD, then their x-coordinates are (6x +4)/2. Let's say point A is at ((6x +4)/2, y_A) and point E is at ((6x +4)/2, y_E). 

Now, FE = 5x +10. If F is another point, perhaps on this perpendicular bisector or elsewhere. But without knowing where F is, it's hard to say.

But if I assume that F is at some position related to E, maybe on the same line. For example, if FE is a vertical segment, then F would be along the perpendicular bisector. But again, no info.

Alternatively, if FE is part of a right triangle with legs FE and something else, but I don't know.

This approach is too speculative. Given the time I've spent without progress, perhaps I should consider that the key is to set up an equation using the relationships between DA, CE, DE, CA, and the other given lengths.

Earlier, I had from the congruence of triangles CDA and CED, but I couldn't proceed. Let me try to assume that CA = DE and DA = CE, and see if I can find a relationship between CD and other segments.

In triangle CDA, by the Law of Cosines: CA² = CD² + DA² - 2*CD*DA*cos(theta), where theta is the angle between CD and DA. Similarly, in triangle CED, CE² = CD² + DE² - 2*CD*DE*cos(phi), where phi is the angle between CD and DE.

But since DA = CE and DE = CA, let's substitute:

CA² = CD² + DA² - 2*CD*DA*cos(theta)  
DA² = CD² + CA² - 2*CD*CA*cos(phi)  

Subtracting the second equation from the first:  
CA² - DA² = CD² + DA² - 2*CD*DA*cos(theta) - CD² - CA² + 2*CD*CA*cos(phi)  
Simplify:  
CA² - DA² - DA² + CA² = -2*CD*DA*cos(theta) + 2*CD*CA*cos(phi)  
2CA² - 2DA² = 2CD( -DA*cos(theta) + CA*cos(phi) )  
Divide both sides by 2:  
CA² - DA² = CD( -DA*cos(theta) + CA
