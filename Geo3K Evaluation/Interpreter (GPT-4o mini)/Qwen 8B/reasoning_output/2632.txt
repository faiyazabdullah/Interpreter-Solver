MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So, we have two triangles, ABC and DEF, which are similar. BG is a median of triangle ABC, and EH is a median of triangle DEF. We need to find the length of EH given that BC is 30, BG is 15, and EF is 15. The answer choices are A. 7.5, B. 15, C. 22.5, D. 30.

First, I remember that similar triangles have corresponding sides in proportion and their medians are also in the same ratio as their corresponding sides. Since ABC ~ DEF, the ratio of their corresponding sides should be constant. Let me note down the given information:

- Triangle ABC ~ Triangle DEF.
- BC = 30, which corresponds to EF = 15. Wait, hold on. In similar triangles, the order of the letters matters. So ABC ~ DEF means AB corresponds to DE, BC corresponds to EF, and AC corresponds to DF. Therefore, BC (from ABC) corresponds to EF (from DEF). 

So the ratio of similarity would be BC / EF = 30 / 15 = 2. That means each side of triangle ABC is twice as long as the corresponding side in triangle DEF. But wait, but BG is a median of ABC, and EH is a median of DEF. Medians correspond in the same ratio as the sides. So since BG is a median in ABC, its corresponding median in DEF would be EH. 

Wait, but how do we relate BG and EH? Let me think. In triangle ABC, BG is a median. So it connects vertex B to the midpoint of AC. Similarly, in triangle DEF, EH is a median connecting vertex E to the midpoint of DF. Because the triangles are similar, the medians should also be in the same ratio as the sides. 

But first, let me confirm the ratio. Since BC corresponds to EF, and BC is 30 while EF is 15, so the scale factor from ABC to DEF is 1/2. That means every length in DEF is half of the corresponding length in ABC. Therefore, the median EH in DEF should be half of the corresponding median in ABC. However, we know BG is 15 in ABC. So if EH corresponds to BG, then EH would be 15*(1/2)=7.5? But wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, actually, the ratio of similarity is ABC : DEF = 2:1 because BC is twice EF. So the ratio of similarity is 2:1. That means that any corresponding linear measure in ABC is twice that in DEF. Therefore, the median BG in ABC corresponds to the median EH in DEF. So BG / EH = 2 / 1. Therefore, EH = BG / 2 = 15 / 2 = 7.5. Which would make the answer A. But let me check again.

Alternatively, perhaps BG is a median in ABC, so BG is the median from B to AC. Then, since ABC ~ DEF, the corresponding median in DEF would be from E to DF. So EH is that median. Therefore, the ratio between BG and EH should be the same as the ratio of the sides. Since BC corresponds to EF, which is 30 vs 15, so ratio is 2:1. Hence, BG (which is a median in ABC) corresponds to EH (median in DEF), so BG / EH = 2 / 1 => EH = BG / 2 = 15 / 2 = 7.5. So answer A.

Wait, but another thought: in some cases, medians may not directly correspond unless they are corresponding medians. For example, in triangle ABC, the median from B would correspond to the median from E in triangle DEF. So yes, because the correspondence is ABC ~ DEF, so vertex B corresponds to vertex E. Therefore, the median from B in ABC corresponds to the median from E in DEF. Thus, the ratio of BG to EH is the same as the ratio of AB to DE, which is the same as BC to EF, which is 2:1. Therefore, BG is twice EH. Given BG=15, then EH=7.5. Therefore, answer A.

But let me verify once more. Suppose the ratio of ABC to DEF is 2:1. Then, all corresponding medians would be in the same ratio. So if BG is a median of ABC, then the corresponding median in DEF is EH, so BG/EH = 2/1. Therefore, EH = BG / 2 = 15 / 2 = 7.5. So answer A.

Alternatively, could there be a mistake here? Maybe I need to consider that BG is a median, so its length depends on the sides of the triangle. Let me recall that in a triangle, the length of a median can be calculated using the formula involving the sides. But since the triangles are similar, perhaps the ratio still holds regardless of the actual lengths?

For instance, suppose in triangle ABC, the median BG divides AC into two equal parts. The length of BG can be found via the formula:

BG² = (2AB² + 2BC² - AC²)/4

But since ABC ~ DEF with ratio 2:1, then DEF has sides half as long. So if we were to compute the corresponding median in DEF, say EH, then the formula would give:

EH² = (2DE² + 2EF² - DF²)/4

But since DE = AB/2, EF = BC/2 = 15, DF = AC/2.

But since ABC ~ DEF, AB corresponds to DE, BC corresponds to EF, AC corresponds to DF. So AB = 2DE, BC = 2EF, AC = 2DF.

Therefore, substituting into BG²:

BG² = (2(2DE)^2 + 2(2EF)^2 - (2DF)^2)/4 = (8DE² + 8EF² - 4DF²)/4 = 2DE² + 2EF² - DF²

Similarly, for EH²:

EH² = (2DE² + 2EF² - DF²)/4

Wait, that seems inconsistent. Wait, no. Let me redo.

Original formula for BG in ABC:

BG² = [2AB² + 2BC² - AC²]/4

Since ABC ~ DEF with ratio 2:1, then AB = 2DE, BC = 2EF, AC = 2DF.

Substituting:

BG² = [2(2DE)^2 + 2(2EF)^2 - (2DF)^2]/4 = [8DE² + 8EF² - 4DF²]/4 = 2DE² + 2EF² - DF²

Now, for the median EH in DEF:

EH² = [2DE² + 2EF² - DF²]/4

So comparing BG² and EH²:

BG² = 2DE² + 2EF² - DF²

EH² = [2DE² + 2EF² - DF²]/4

Thus, BG² = 4 * EH² → BG = 2*EH → EH = BG / 2

Which confirms that EH = 15 / 2 = 7.5. Therefore, answer A.

So regardless of the specific sides, the ratio of the medians is the same as the ratio of the corresponding sides. Therefore, the answer is A. 7.5.
