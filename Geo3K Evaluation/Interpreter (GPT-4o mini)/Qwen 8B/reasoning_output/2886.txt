MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, C, D, and O, with O being the center of a circle. All these points lie on the circle. The question asks for the measure of angle D, which I assume refers to angle at point D, so maybe angle ADC or something? Wait, looking back, the given angles are Angle(A,B,C), Angle(B,C,D), Angle(C,D,A), and Angle(D,A,B). Let me parse that.

First, the setup: Points A, B, C, D are all on a circle centered at O. That means they're concyclic points. So, ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral? Because all four points lie on a circle. Wait, but cyclic quadrilaterals have opposite angles summing to 180 degrees. But here, we have angles at each vertex. However, the angles given are consecutive. Let me note down the given angle measures:

Measure of angle ABC = 3y + 4
Measure of angle BCD = 2x
Measure of angle CDA = 2y + 16
Measure of angle DAB = 58 degrees

Wait, the problem says "Find m∠D". Hmm. In a quadrilateral, angle D would typically be angle ADC if it's labeled in order. But depending on how the points are arranged, maybe angle at D is one of those. Wait, the angles given are:

Angle(A,B,C) is angle at B, since it's ABC. Similarly, angle(B,C,D) is angle at C, angle(C,D,A) is angle at D, and angle(D,A,B) is angle at A. So the four angles of quadrilateral ABCD are:

At A: angle DAB = 58°
At B: angle ABC = 3y + 4
At C: angle BCD = 2x
At D: angle CDA = 2y + 16

So the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360 degrees. Therefore, adding up all these angles should equal 360. Let me write that equation:

(58) + (3y + 4) + (2x) + (2y + 16) = 360

Combine like terms:

58 + 4 + 16 = 78
Then, 3y + 2y = 5y
So total equation becomes:

78 + 5y + 2x = 360

Which simplifies to:

5y + 2x = 360 - 78 = 282 → 5y + 2x = 282. Equation (1)

But there's another thing here. Since ABCD is cyclic, the sum of opposite angles should be 180 degrees. Wait, in cyclic quadrilaterals, opposite angles are supplementary. So angle A + angle C = 180, and angle B + angle D = 180.

Let me check. So angle A is 58°, angle C is angle BCD = 2x. Then angle A + angle C = 58 + 2x = 180 → 2x = 122 → x = 61. Alternatively, angle B + angle D = (3y + 4) + (2y + 16) = 5y + 20 = 180 → 5y = 160 → y = 32. 

Wait, so if we use the cyclic quadrilateral property, we can get two equations. Let me try that.

From angle A + angle C = 180:

58 + 2x = 180 → 2x = 122 → x = 61.

From angle B + angle D = 180:

(3y + 4) + (2y + 16) = 5y + 20 = 180 → 5y = 160 → y = 32.

So substituting back, x=61, y=32.

Therefore, angle D is angle CDA = 2y +16 = 2*32 +16 = 64 +16 = 80 degrees. Which would be answer C. 

Alternatively, let's verify with the other equation. From earlier, we had equation (1): 5y + 2x = 282. If x=61 and y=32, then 5*32=160, 2*61=122; 160+122=282, which checks out. So that works. 

Thus, angle D is 80 degrees. Hence, the answer is C.
