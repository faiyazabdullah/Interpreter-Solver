Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a circle with center P, and several points J, K, L, M, N on it. There's also some lines connecting these points to P. Also, there's a right angle at angle JPN, meaning that NP is perpendicular to PL. And they told us that the measure of angle MPL is 65 degrees. We need to find the measure of arc NJK.

First, I should recall some circle theorems. Since all the points are on the circle centered at P, each of those points is equidistant from P. That means that segments PJ, PK, PL, PM, PN are all radii of the circle. So, all those segments are equal in length. 

Now, angle MPL is given as 65 degrees. Let me visualize that. Points M, P, and L. Since P is the center, PM and PL are radii. Wait, but angle MPL would be an angle at point P? No, wait. The notation angle MPL means the vertex is at point P? Wait, no. In standard notation, angle ABC is the angle at point B. So angle MPL would be the angle at point P between points M and L. Wait, but if P is the center, then MP and LP are both radii. So angle at P between M and L. So that would be the central angle corresponding to arc ML. Therefore, the measure of angle MPL is equal to the measure of arc ML. Because in a circle, the central angle equals the measure of its intercepted arc. So, arc ML measures 65 degrees.

But then there's another part: NP is perpendicular to PL. So NP ⊥ PL. Since PL is a radius, and NP is another segment from P to N. Wait, but NP is a radius too because N is on the circle. Wait, if NP is perpendicular to PL, then the angle between NP and PL is 90 degrees. But since both NP and PL are radii, that would mean that angle NPL is 90 degrees. So that angle at P between N and L is 90 degrees, so the arc NL would be 90 degrees. Because again, central angle equals arc measure. So arc NL is 90 degrees.

So now, we know arc ML is 65 degrees and arc NL is 90 degrees. Now, how does this relate to arc NJK?

Wait, the question asks for the measure of arc NJK. Let me think about the order of the points. The arc NJK would start at N, go through J, then to K. But I need to figure out how these points are arranged around the circle.

Since all points J, K, L, M, N are on the circle with center P, they're all points on the circumference. Let me try to sketch mentally. Let me assume the circle with center P. Let me note that NP is perpendicular to PL. So, if I imagine PL as a radius going to point L, then NP is a radius perpendicular to PL. So, starting from point L, moving 90 degrees along the circle to get to N. Wait, but direction matters. Depending on the orientation, but maybe we can assume clockwise or counterclockwise. Alternatively, since angles are involved, perhaps the arcs can be added accordingly.

Also, angle at P between M and L is 65 degrees, so arc ML is 65 degrees. Then, arc NL is 90 degrees. So, maybe we can find other arcs?

Let me consider the entire circle is 360 degrees. So, if we can find the sum of certain arcs, maybe we can find arc NJK.

But first, let's try to arrange the points. Let me think about where J, K, L, M, N are located.

We have NP ⊥ PL. So, if PL is a radius pointing in one direction, NP is a radius pointing perpendicularly. For example, suppose PL is pointing to the right, then NP could be pointing up or down. Let's say PL is horizontal to the right, then NP is vertical upwards. So, point N is at the top of the circle, and L is to the right. Then, the arc from N to L is 90 degrees, which would make sense.

Then, angle MPL is 65 degrees. So, angle at P between M and L. So, if L is to the right, then point M would be somewhere such that the angle from PL to PM is 65 degrees. So, depending on the direction, maybe M is above or below. Wait, but if N is at the top, then maybe M is somewhere else. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe we can use coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to simplify. Let’s place point P at the origin (0,0). Suppose PL is along the positive x-axis. So, point L is at (r, 0), where r is the radius. Then, NP is perpendicular to PL, so NP is vertical. Since NP is a radius, point N would be either at (0, r) or (0, -r). Assuming standard position, let's take (0, r). So, point N is straight up from P.

Now, angle MPL is 65 degrees. So, point M is such that angle at P between M and L is 65 degrees. Since L is at (r, 0), and P is at (0,0), then PM is making a 65-degree angle with PL. Since PL is along the positive x-axis, then PM would be at an angle of 65 degrees from PL. So, if we consider the angle between PL (x-axis) and PM is 65 degrees, then point M would be at an angle of 65 degrees from the x-axis. So, coordinates of M would be (r cos θ, r sin θ), where θ is 65 degrees. Wait, but direction depends on whether it's clockwise or counterclockwise. Let me assume counterclockwise. So, if we go counterclockwise from PL (positive x-axis) by 65 degrees, point M would be located at 65 degrees from the x-axis. So, in that case, the arc from L to M is 65 degrees, so arc LM is 65 degrees.

Now, we need to find arc NJK. Let's see. Arc NJK goes from N to J to K. So, we need to figure out the positions of J and K.

But we don't have explicit info about J and K except that they lie on the circle. However, there's a right angle mentioned: Angle JPN is a right angle. So, angle at P between J and N is 90 degrees. Wait, the given predicate says RightAngle(Angle(J, P, N)), which means angle at P between J and N is a right angle. So, angle JPN is 90 degrees. Therefore, the angle between JP and NP is 90 degrees. Since NP is along the positive y-axis (from earlier assumption), then JP would be along the negative x-axis or positive x-axis? Wait, angle between JP and NP is 90 degrees. Since NP is along positive y-axis, then JP would be along positive x-axis or negative x-axis. Wait, if NP is upward (y-axis), then for angle JPN to be 90 degrees, JP must be along the positive or negative x-axis. But point L is already on the positive x-axis (since PL is along x-axis). So, unless J is at the same position as L, but that's probably not the case. Wait, but J is another point on the circle. Let me think.

If angle JPN is 90 degrees, then vectors PJ and PN are perpendicular. Since PN is along the positive y-axis, vector PN is (0, r). Vector PJ would be perpendicular to that, so it has to be along the x-axis. Therefore, point J must be on the x-axis. But point L is also on the x-axis. Wait, but L is already defined as being on the circle. Unless J is the same as L, but that's unlikely since they are different points. Wait, but maybe J is on the opposite side? If PN is up, then PJ would be along negative x-axis. So, point J would be at (-r, 0). So, that's the leftmost point of the circle. So, J is at (-r, 0).

Therefore, points:

- P is at (0,0)

- L is at (r, 0)

- N is at (0, r)

- J is at (-r, 0)

So, arc from J to N would be from (-r,0) to (0,r). What's the measure of that arc? The angle at center P between J and N is 90 degrees, since angle JPN is 90 degrees. Therefore, arc JN is 90 degrees.

Now, we need to find arc NJK. So, starting at N, going through J, then to K. Wait, arc NJK implies that the arc starts at N, passes through J, and ends at K. So, the arc from N to K passing through J. Wait, but J is between N and K? Or maybe the arc is from N to K, with J lying on it. So, we need to find the measure of arc NK that includes J.

But we need more information about K. How do we find where K is?

Wait, the problem mentions points J, K, L, M, N on the circle. So, all five points are on the circle. We've placed J, L, M, N. Where is K?

But we haven't used the fact that K is on the circle. Maybe we can find relations involving K. Wait, the problem doesn't give any specific info about K except that it's on the circle. Hmm. But maybe we can find the position of K via other relations?

Alternatively, maybe the arc NJK relates to other arcs we've found.

We know arc JN is 90 degrees (as discussed). Then, if we can find arc JK, then adding them would give arc NJK. Wait, but arc NJK is from N to K through J. So, that would be arc from N to J plus arc from J to K. Which would be 90 degrees + arc JK.

But we need to find arc JK. How?

Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Let me recap what we know:

Arc ML is 65 degrees (from angle MPL).

Arc NL is 90 degrees (from NP ⊥ PL).

Arc JN is 90 degrees.

What about arc JM? Not sure yet.

Wait, maybe considering the total circle. Let me try to compute the positions of all points.

Points on the circle:

- N is at (0, r)

- J is at (-r, 0)

- L is at (r, 0)

- M is at (r cos 65°, r sin 65°). Wait, earlier we said angle between PL (x-axis) and PM is 65 degrees, so point M is at 65 degrees from x-axis. So, coordinates would be (r cos 65°, r sin 65°). So, that places M in the upper half of the circle.

Now, where is point K? It's another point on the circle. But we don't have direct info about it. However, perhaps there's something missing here. Wait, maybe the points are ordered in a particular way around the circle. For instance, maybe they are labeled in order around the circle, but without more info, it's hard to tell. However, since we need to find arc NJK, which involves points N, J, and K, perhaps K is positioned in relation to other points.

Alternatively, maybe there's another relationship. Wait, we have all points on the circle, and we have some arcs. Let me check the total degrees.

Total circle is 360 degrees. Let me try to calculate known arcs:

Arc NL is 90 degrees (from N to L).

Arc ML is 65 degrees (from M to L).

Arc JN is 90 degrees (from J to N).

Let me try to map these arcs.

Starting from point N at (0, r), going to J at (-r, 0): that's 90 degrees.

From J at (-r, 0) to ... Well, if we go clockwise, from J to N is 90 degrees. From N to L is 90 degrees (arc NL). Then from L to M is 65 degrees (arc ML). Then, what's left?

But the total circle is 360 degrees. So, if we add up the arcs we know:

Arc JN: 90°

Arc NL: 90°

Arc ML: 65°

But that's only parts. Let me think of the entire arrangement.

Assuming points are ordered as follows (clockwise):

Starting at N (top), going clockwise to J (left), then to L (right), then to M (somewhere in upper right), then back to N. Wait, but that may not account for all points.

Alternatively, maybe the points are arranged in the order N, J, K, L, M, and back? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe we need to find the measure of arc NJK, which is from N to K passing through J. So, that arc would consist of arc NJ (which is 90°) plus arc JK. So, if we can find arc JK, then adding to 90° gives the total.

But how to find arc JK?

Wait, we might need to find the position of K. Are there any other clues?

Wait, the problem didn't mention anything else about K directly. But all points are on the circle, including K. Is there any other information that can help us locate K?

Wait, perhaps there's an implied ordering of the points. For example, since there are multiple points on the circle, maybe they are arranged in a certain order. But without more information, it's challenging. However, maybe we can infer based on existing arcs.

Wait, let's think about the arcs we have:

Arc NL is 90°, arc ML is 65°, arc JN is 90°. Let me try to add these up and see what remains.

Imagine starting at N, going to J (90°), then from J to K (unknown), then from K to L (unknown?), then from L to M (65°), then from M back to N (unknown)? This seems too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps we can look for symmetry or other relationships. For example, if we consider that point K is connected to other points, but there's no info given. Wait, but the original problem statement lists all points J, K, L, M, N as lying on the circle, but doesn't specify their order. So, perhaps the arc NJK refers to the arc that starts at N, goes through J, and ends at K, implying that K is in a specific location relative to J and N.

Wait, but without knowing where K is, how can we determine the measure of arc NJK? There must be something missing here. Wait, maybe there's a property I'm missing.

Wait, the problem mentions that angle MPL is 65°, which we've associated with arc ML being 65°, and NP ⊥ PL leading to arc NL being 90°. Also, angle JPN is 90°, giving arc JN as 90°. Now, if we can find the remaining arcs, maybe we can deduce arc NJK.

Let me think about the entire circle. The sum of all arcs should be 360°. Let me try to calculate the arcs we know:

Arc JN: 90°

Arc NL: 90°

Arc ML: 65°

But that's three arcs. What about arc MJ and arc K...?

Wait, maybe I need to consider overlapping arcs. For example, if we consider the arc from N to L is 90°, and arc from L to M is 65°, then arc from N to M would be 90° + 65° = 155°. But that's just one possibility.

But how does this help with arc NJK?

Alternatively, since we have arc JN as 90°, and we need arc NJK, which would be arc from N to K passing through J. So, if K is positioned such that arc from J to K is something, then arc NJK is 90° + arc JK.

But how to find arc JK?

Wait, maybe there's another arc that connects to K. For example, if we consider the arc from M to K, but we don't have info about that. Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between K and other points.

Wait, but all points are arbitrary on the circle except for the ones we've already considered. Perhaps the problem assumes that the points are in order around the circle, like N, J, K, L, M, and back? Not sure. Without more info, it's tricky.

Wait, perhaps the key lies in realizing that arc NJK is composed of arc NJ plus arc JK, and we can find arc JK somehow.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that the total circle is 360°, and subtract known arcs.

Let me try to think differently. Let's consider the circle divided into arcs:

- Arc JN: 90°

- Arc NL: 90°

- Arc LM: 65°

What about the rest?

From point M, going back to N? Let me think. If we go from M to N, what's the arc measure? Well, arc MN would be the remaining portion. But we don't know that yet.

But maybe we can find arc MK or something else.

Wait, but how does point K fit in here? Since the problem asks for arc NJK, which is from N to K through J. So, if I imagine the circle, starting at N, going through J to K. So, arc NJK is the major arc or minor arc? It depends on where K is.

Alternatively, maybe arc NJK is the arc from N to K that passes through J, which would be the larger arc if K is on the opposite side.

But without knowing where K is, how can we proceed?

Wait, perhaps there's another clue. The problem includes point K, but no direct info about it. However, all points are on the circle, so maybe we need to use other properties. Wait, maybe there's an inscribed angle or something related to K.

Alternatively, perhaps the arc NJK corresponds to some other angle that we can derive.

Wait, let's think about the entire circle. Total degrees: 360°.

Known arcs:

Arc JN: 90°

Arc NL: 90°

Arc LM: 65°

Let me add those: 90 + 90 + 65 = 245°. So, the remaining arc would be 360 - 245 = 115°, which would be the arc from M back to J, passing through K? Or something like that.

But how does that help?

Alternatively, if we consider that the arc from M to J would be 115°, then arc MJ is 115°. But how does that help with arc NJK?

Wait, arc NJK is from N to K through J. So, if we can express arc NK as arc NJ + arc JK, and if we can find arc NK, then subtract arc JK... but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to find arc JK using other relationships.

Wait, earlier we had arc from N to L is 90°, and arc from L to M is 65°, so arc from N to M is 90 + 65 = 155°. So, arc NM is 155°. Then, if we can find arc KM or something else.

Wait, but where is point K? It's another point on the circle. Suppose that the arc from M to K is some value, and arc from K to N is another value. But without more info, it's still unclear.

Wait, perhaps there's another relationship involving point K. Let me check the initial predicates again. The problem lists points J, K, L, M, N as lying on the circle. There's no direct info about K, but since all are on the circle, maybe K is positioned such that arc NK is related to other arcs.

Wait, but I'm stuck here. Let me think again. The question is asking for the measure of arc NJK. Let me think of arc NJK as the arc that starts at N, goes through J, and ends at K. So, the measure of this arc would be equal to the measure of arc NJ plus arc JK. We already know arc NJ is 90°, so if we can find arc JK, we can add them.

But how to find arc JK? Maybe there's an inscribed angle that involves point K?

Wait, but there's no given angle involving K. Unless there's something I missed.

Wait, the problem states that angle MPL is 65°, which we've used. Also, NP is perpendicular to PL, giving arc NL as 90°. And angle JPN is 90°, giving arc JN as 90°.

Is there any other information? All points are on the circle, and we have these arcs. Maybe the arc NJK is formed by combining arc NJ (90°) and arc JK, which we can find by looking at other arcs.

Wait, what if we consider the total circle. If arc from N to M is 155°, as previously determined (90° from N to L plus 65° from L to M), then arc from M to N is 155°, so the arc from N to M is 155°. If we can find arc from M to K, then maybe...

But without knowing where K is, this isn't helpful.

Wait, maybe the key is that the arc NJK is supplementary to some other arc. For example, if arc NJK is 180° minus some other arc. But this is too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a property I'm missing. Let me recall that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. But do we have any inscribed angles here?

Wait, the problem mentions a right angle at angle JPN, which is a central angle, not an inscribed angle. But maybe other angles?

Wait, but we don't have any other angles given. The only angle given is angle MPL (central angle, 65°) and the right angle at JPN (also central angle, 90°). So, no inscribed angles mentioned.

Hmm. Maybe I need to reconsider the diagram. Let me try to reorient.

Let me draw the circle with center P. Place point L at (r, 0), point N at (0, r), point J at (-r, 0). Now, point M is somewhere such that angle MPL is 65°, so it's 65° from PL (the x-axis). So, point M is at 65° from x-axis, so its coordinates are (r cos 65°, r sin 65°). 

Now, where is point K? Since all points are on the circle, but we don't have info. However, the question is about arc NJK. Let's assume that K is another point on the circle. If we can find the measure of arc NJK, it might depend on the placement of K. But since there's no more info, perhaps the arc NJK is determined by other constraints.

Wait, perhaps arc NJK is formed by combining arc NJ (90°) and arc JK. If I can find arc JK, then I can add it to 90° to get the total. To find arc JK, maybe there's a relationship with other arcs.

Wait, what's the total of all arcs? Let's think: the circle is 360°. We have arc JN = 90°, arc NL = 90°, arc LM = 65°. So, that's 90+90+65=245°. The remaining arc would be from M back to J, which is 360-245=115°. So, arc MJ is 115°. Now, arc MJ is from M to J. If we can break this arc into arc MK + arc KJ, then arc KJ would be part of it. But again, without knowing where K is, it's difficult.

But if arc NJK is from N to K through J, then it would cover arc NJ (90°) plus arc JK. But arc JK is part of arc MJ (115°). Wait, if arc MJ is 115°, and arc JK is a part of it, then arc JK = arc MJ - arc MK. But without knowing where K is, we can't determine this.

Wait, maybe there's a property that arc NJK corresponds to twice some angle? Or perhaps the arc NJK is equal to the supplement of some other arc?

Alternatively, since we have arc NL = 90°, and arc LM = 65°, maybe point K is located such that arc NK is something. Let me think.

Wait, if I consider arc from N to K, passing through J, which would be arc NJK. So, arc NJK is the same as arc NK, but taking the longer path through J. So, the measure of arc NJK would be 360° minus the measure of arc NK that doesn't pass through J.

But how to find arc NK?

Well, arc NK could be calculated if we know the positions of N and K. But without knowing K, this is tricky.

Wait, but maybe there's another way. Let me think: the arc NJK is the arc from N to K through J. If I can find the measure of arc NK, then the arc NJK would be 360° minus arc NK if it's the major arc, or arc NK if it's the minor arc. But without knowing where K is, this is not helpful.

I feel like I'm missing a piece of information here. Let me revisit the problem statement to ensure I didn't miss anything.

Problem says: In ⊙P, m∠MPL = 65 and NP ⊥ PL. Find m∠NJK.

Wait, wait! Did I misread the question? Let me check again.

Original question: Find m∠NJK. Wait, no, the user wrote: "Find m ∠ NJK." Wait, no, the question says: "Find m ∠ NJK" — wait, no, looking back:

Wait, the original question says: "Find m ∠ NJK." Wait, no, the user wrote:

"Find m ∠ NJK."

Wait, no, actually, the user wrote:

"Find m widehat NJK." Oh, right! It's the measure of arc NJK, not angle NJK. I thought it was angle, but it's arc. So, arc NJK.

Ah, okay, that changes things. So, the measure of arc NJK.

So, arc NJK is the arc from N to K passing through J. So, as before.

But how to find that?

Let me think again. Since arc JN is 90°, and if I can find arc JK, then adding them gives arc NJK.

But how to find arc JK?

Wait, let me consider the entire circle. If I can find the measure of arc NK, then arc NJK would be arc NJ + arc JK = 90° + arc JK. But arc NK could be found if I know the positions of N and K. But I don't know where K is.

Wait, but maybe there's another arc we can calculate. For example, arc from M to K?

Wait, but we don't have any info about K. Unless there's something about the other points. For example, if K is positioned such that arc MK is related to other arcs.

Alternatively, maybe the arc NJK is equal to arc NJ plus arc JK, and since arc NJ is 90°, and arc JK is the same as arc from J to K, which is part of the remaining arcs.

Earlier, we found that the arc from M to J is 115°. So, arc MJ is 115°. If K is somewhere on the circle, then arc JK would be a part of that 115° arc. But unless K is specifically placed at a certain point, we can't determine it.

Wait, but maybe there's an implicit assumption that the points are placed in order around the circle. For example, if the points are ordered as N, J, K, L, M around the circle. Let me try that.

Assume the points are ordered clockwise as N → J → K → L → M → N. Let's see:

Starting at N, going to J (90°), then to K (let's say x degrees), then to L (which is 90° from N, so arc NL is 90°, which would mean arc from N to L is 90°, which would imply that from N to J to K to L adds up to 90° + x + arc KL = 90°. Wait, this seems confusing.

Alternatively, if the points are ordered N, J, K, L, M, then arc NJK would be from N to K through J, which would be arc NJ + arc JK = 90° + arc JK. But arc JK would be the arc from J to K, which would depend on where K is.

But without knowing where K is, this is still ambiguous. 

Wait, but perhaps there's a property I'm missing. Let me think about the arc NJK. Since it's an arc that goes through J, and we know arc NJ is 90°, maybe there's a relationship between arc NJK and other arcs.

Wait, another idea: since NP is perpendicular to PL, and NP is a radius, and PL is a radius, forming a right angle at P. So, the arc from N to L is 90°, as before. Also, arc ML is 65°, as given. So, if we consider the arc from M to L is 65°, and arc from N to L is 90°, then arc from M to N would be 90° + 65° = 155°, assuming they are on the same side. 

Now, if we consider the full circle, the total degrees are 360°. So, the remaining arc would be from M back to N through the other side, which would be 360° - 155° = 205°. But this arc would go from M through K to N, but we don't know where K is.

However, if arc NJK is the arc from N to K through J, then maybe it's related to this 205° arc. But again, without knowing K's position, this is not helpful.

Wait, let's think about the total degrees again. We have arc JN = 90°, arc NL = 90°, arc LM = 65°, totaling 245°. The remaining arc is 360 - 245 = 115°, which would be from M back to J. So, arc MJ is 115°. If arc MJ is 115°, then arc from M to J is 115°. Now, if point K is somewhere on this arc MJ, then arc JK would be part of this 115° arc. But without knowing where K is, we can't determine arc JK.

Wait, but maybe there's a standard position for K? Like, perhaps K is the midpoint of arc MJ? Or is there another constraint?

Wait, the problem includes all points J, K, L, M, N on the circle, but no further info. So, maybe there's an implied order or positioning. For example, if we assume that the points are placed in the order N, J, K, L, M around the circle, then arc NJK would be from N to K through J, which would be arc NJ + arc JK = 90° + arc JK. But arc JK would be part of the arc from J to K, which is part of the 115° arc from J to M. 

But without knowing where K is, this is still impossible to determine. 

Wait, but maybe the arc NJK is meant to be the arc that is opposite to arc ML? Or something like that. 

Alternatively, maybe the measure of arc NJK is equal to the measure of arc ML, which is 65°, but that seems random.

Wait, let me try another approach. Since we know arc JN is 90°, and arc NL is 90°, and arc LM is 65°, then if we consider the arc from N to M, it's 90° + 65° = 155°, as before. Now, if we can find the measure of arc NK, then arc NJK would be 360° minus arc NK, or something like that. 

But how to find arc NK?

Wait, arc NK would be from N to K. If K is somewhere on the circle, then depending on where it is, arc NK varies. But since there's no info about K, this suggests that there's a missing piece of information, which makes me think I might have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, going back to the beginning. The problem states that NP is perpendicular to PL. So, NP ⊥ PL. Since both are radii, this creates a right angle at P between NP and PL. Thus, arc NL is 90°, as before. Also, angle MPL is 65°, so arc ML is 65°. 

Now, what about the right angle at JPN? It says RightAngle(Angle(J, P, N)), so angle at P between J and N is 90°, so arc JN is 90°, as before.

Now, if we consider the entire circle, we have arc JN = 90°, arc NL = 90°, arc LM = 65°. Let me add these: 90 + 90 + 65 = 245°. So, the remaining arc is 360 - 245 = 115°, which is arc from M back to J. 

Now, if we can find the measure of arc from J to K, then arc NJK is 90° + arc JK. But arc JK is part of the 115° arc from J to M. If we assume that K is at point M, then arc JK would be arc JM = 115°, making arc NJK = 90 + 115 = 205°, which is likely not one of the options. 

Alternatively, if K is at point L, then arc JK would be arc JL. Let's calculate arc JL. From J to L, which is from (-r, 0) to (r, 0), so it's 180°, since it's a diameter. But arc JL would be 180°, making arc NJK = 90 + 180 = 270°, which is also not an option. 

This suggests that my assumptions are wrong. Maybe I need to rethink the setup.

Wait, maybe the arc NJK is not the major arc but the minor arc. Let me think: if K is somewhere such that arc NJK is the minor arc. But without knowing where K is, this is still uncertain.

Wait, perhaps there's an error in assuming that arc JN is 90°. Let me double-check. Angle JPN is a right angle, which is at point P, between J and N. Since P is the center, this is a central angle, so yes, its measure is equal to the arc it intercepts. So, arc JN is 90°, correct.

Similarly, arc NL is 90°, arc ML is 65°.

So, total of these arcs: 90 + 90 + 65 = 245°. Remaining arc is 115°, which is from M back to J. So, arc MJ is 115°.

Now, if we consider arc NJK, which is from N to K through J, then this would be arc NJ (90°) plus arc JK. But arc JK is part of arc MJ (115°). So, if we can find arc JK, we need to know where K is on arc MJ. 

But since the problem includes point K, and all points are on the circle, maybe K is the midpoint of arc MJ? If so, then arc JK would be half of 115°, which is 57.5°, making arc NJK = 90 + 57.5 = 147.5°, which is not among the options. 

Alternatively, maybe K is at point M, making arc JK = 115°, giving arc NJK = 205°, which is not an option. 

Alternatively, maybe K is at point L? But arc JL is 180°, so arc NJK would be 90 + 180 = 270°, also not an option.

This suggests that there's a flaw in my reasoning. Let me go back.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the arc ML. Let me re-examine that. The problem states that m∠MPL = 65°. Since P is the center, this is a central angle, so it equals the measure of arc ML. So, arc ML is 65°, correct. 

But what about the position of point M? If arc ML is 65°, then point M is 65° away from L along the circle. But if L is at (r, 0), then point M is at 65° from L. Depending on the direction, it could be clockwise or counterclockwise. Let's say it's counterclockwise from L. So, from L at (r, 0), moving counterclockwise 65°, placing M at 65° from L, which would be at angle 0° + 65° = 65° from the positive x-axis. So, coordinates (r cos 65°, r sin 65°). 

Now, arc from M to J: from M at 65° to J at 180° (since J is at (-r, 0), which is 180° from positive x-axis). So, the arc from M to J is 180° - 65° = 115°, which matches our previous calculation. 

Now, if we assume that point K is somewhere on this arc MJ, then arc JK would be part of this 115° arc. But without knowing where K is, we cannot determine arc JK. 

But the problem must have enough information to solve it. So, perhaps there's a property I'm missing. Let me think: since NP is perpendicular to PL, and NP is a radius, and PL is a radius, creating a right angle at P. Also, angle JPN is 90°, creating another right angle. 

Maybe there's a relationship between these right angles and the position of K. For example, if K is such that some other angle is formed. 

Wait, the problem doesn't mention any other angles, so perhaps I need to consider that the arc NJK is formed by combining arc NJ (90°) and arc JK, and that arc JK is complementary to some other arc. 

Wait, let me think about the total of the arcs. If arc NJK is x, then x = 90° + arc JK. Also, the remaining arc from K to M is 115° - arc JK. But without more info, this is not helpful.

Wait, maybe the arc NJK is supplementary to arc ML? 65°, so 180 - 65 = 115°? Not sure.

Alternatively, since arc ML is 65°, and arc NL is 90°, maybe there's a way to combine these. 

Wait, if I consider the arc from N to M, which is 90° (NL) + 65° (LM) = 155°, as before. Now, if arc NJK is part of the circle, and if it's the arc from N to K through J, then it might be related to this 155° arc. 

For example, if arc NJK is the complement of arc KM. But I don't see how.

Alternatively, if arc NJK is equal to arc ML, which is 65°, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe the measure of arc NJK is equal to the supplement of arc ML. 180 - 65 = 115°. But 115° is not one of the options. 

Wait, the answer choices are A. 25, B. 75, C. 90, D. 155. 

Hmm. Let me think again. What if arc NJK is 180° - 65° = 115°? But 115 is not an option. Or 90° + 65° = 155°, which is option D. 

Wait, let me think: if arc NJK is the arc from N to K through J, and if K is positioned such that arc NK is 155°, then arc NJK would be 155°. But why would arc NK be 155°?

Wait, arc from N to K through J would be arc NJ + arc JK. If arc NJ is 90°, and arc JK is 65°, then total is 155°. But why would arc JK be 65°?

Wait, if arc ML is 65°, and if arc JK is equal to arc ML, then it would be 65°, making arc NJK = 90 + 65 = 155°, which is option D. 

But why would arc JK be equal to arc ML? There's no direct reason, unless there's some symmetry or property I'm missing.

Wait, but if we consider that arc ML is 65°, and if there's a reflection or rotation that maps ML to JK, but without knowing the exact configuration, this is speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the measure of arc NJK is equal to the measure of arc ML, which is 65°, but that doesn't match with the options. Or, if it's the supplement, 180 - 65 = 115°, not an option.

Wait, but option D is 155°, which is 180 - 25. Where does 25 come from?

Wait, let me think about the arc NJK. If arc NJ is 90°, and arc JK is 65°, then total is 155°. Why would arc JK be 65°? Because arc ML is 65°, and if there's some relationship between arc ML and arc JK.

Wait, if we consider that arc ML is 65°, and arc JK is also 65°, then arc NJK would be 90 + 65 = 155°, which is option D. But why would arc JK be 65°?

Unless there's a property that arc JK is equal to arc ML. But why? Maybe because of some isosceles or symmetric property? 

Alternatively, maybe there's a cyclic quadrilateral or something. But I don't see it.

Alternatively, let me consider the total of the arcs. If arc NJK is 155°, then the remaining arc would be 360 - 155 = 205°, which would be the arc from K to N through M and L. But this is speculative.

Given that option D is 155°, and the calculation of arc from N to M is 155°, maybe the arc NJK is the same as arc NM, which is 155°. But why would arc NJK be the same as arc NM?

Because if K is at point M, then arc NJK would be arc NJ + arc JK = 90° + arc JM = 90° + 115° = 205°, which is not 155°. 

Wait, but if K is at point L, then arc NJK would be arc NJ + arc JK = 90° + arc JL. Arc JL is 180°, so 90 + 180 = 270°, not matching.

Alternatively, if K is at point M, then arc NJK would be from N to M through J, which is arc NJ + arc JM = 90° + 115° = 205°, which is not an option.

Wait, but if arc NJK is the arc from N to K through J, and if K is such that arc NK is 155°, then arc NJK would be 155°. But how to justify that?

If arc from N to K is 155°, then it would be the same as arc from N to M, which is 155°. So, if K is at M, then arc NJK is 205°, but if K is at a different point, it could vary.

This is very confusing. Given the answer choices, and the presence of 15
