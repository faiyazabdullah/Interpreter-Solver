Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. So, we have a parallelogram JKL M. Wait, the name is J K L M? Let me make sure I parse that correctly. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are parallel and equal. Also, opposite angles are equal, and consecutive angles are supplementary. 

First, the given predicates: Parallelogram(J,K,L,M). That means the points J, K, L, M form a parallelogram. Then, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(J,K,L)), 109). So Angle at point K, formed by points J, K, L. So angle JKL is 109 degrees. And Equals(LengthOf(Line(M,L)), 6). So the length of segment ML is 6 units. 

The question is to find the measure of angle JML. Let me visualize this. Let me try to sketch mentally. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. So if it's J-K-L-M, then sides JK and LM are opposite, so they should be equal. Similarly, KL and MJ are opposite. 

Wait, but the order of the letters matters here. In a parallelogram, the vertices are listed in order, so the sides are JK, KL, LM, and MJ. So connecting J to K to L to M back to J. So that would make the sides JK and LM being opposite, and KL and JM being opposite. 

So, given that, angle JKL is at vertex K, between points J, K, L. Since it's a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. So angle at K (JKL) and angle at L (KLM) should add up to 180 degrees. But wait, maybe I need to think about the properties more carefully.

In a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So angle JKL and angle KLM are consecutive? Wait, no. Let me clarify. Each pair of adjacent angles in a parallelogram are supplementary. For example, angle at K (JKL) and angle at L (KLM) are consecutive? Or perhaps angle at K and angle at J?

Wait, maybe I should recall that in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So angle JKL equals angle JML? Wait, not sure yet. Let me think again.

Let me label the parallelogram properly. Let me imagine points J, K, L, M arranged such that JK is one side, KL is the next, LM is the third, and MJ is the fourth. So the vertices are in order J-K-L-M-J. Therefore, sides JK and LM are opposite, and sides KL and MJ are opposite.

Now, angle JKL is the angle at vertex K, between points J, K, L. So that's one of the angles of the parallelogram. Given that this angle measures 109 degrees. Now, since opposite angles in a parallelogram are equal, the angle opposite to angle JKL would be angle at M. Wait, angle at M would be angle JML? Wait, no. Let me see.

Angle JKL is at vertex K. The opposite angle would be at vertex M. Because in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So angle JKL = angle JML? Wait, maybe not. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that angle JKL is at K, and the opposite angle would be at M. So angle at M, which would be angle JMK? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused with the labels.

Alternatively, maybe I should use coordinates to model this. Suppose I place the parallelogram in coordinate system. Let me assign coordinates to the points. Let me assume point K is at origin (0,0), point J is along x-axis, say at (a,0). Point L would be somewhere, since KL is another side. Wait, but without knowing angles or sides, it's tricky. Alternatively, maybe focus on the properties.

Given that angle JKL is 109 degrees. Since in a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. So angle at K (JKL) and angle at J (AJK?) Wait, no. Adjacent angles are those that share a common side. So angle at K (between J, K, L) and angle at J (between K, J, M). These two angles are adjacent and supplementary. So angle JKL + angle KJM = 180 degrees. Wait, but I don't know angle at J yet.

But the problem asks for angle JML. Let me figure out where angle JML is located. Angle JML is the angle at point M, between points J, M, L. So vertex at M, with segments MJ and ML. 

Since it's a parallelogram, sides MJ and KL are opposite and equal. Also, sides ML and JK are opposite and equal. Wait, ML is given as length 6. So ML is one of the sides. Wait, ML is the side from M to L. Since in the parallelogram, ML is opposite to JK. So length of ML equals length of JK. But we aren't told anything about JK's length except that ML is 6. But maybe that's not directly helpful.

But focusing on angles. Since angle JKL is 109 degrees. In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So angle JKL is opposite to angle JML? Wait, angle JKL is at K, and angle JML is at M. Are these opposite angles?

Yes! Because in the parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So angle at K and angle at M are opposite. So angle JKL (at K) equals angle JML (at M). Therefore, if angle JKL is 109 degrees, then angle JML is also 109 degrees. So the answer would be C, 109. 

Wait, but let me confirm. Let me think again. In a parallelogram, the opposite angles are equal. So angle at K and angle at M are opposite. So yes, angle JKL is angle at K, which is equal to angle at M. What is angle at M? It's the angle between points J, M, L. Which is angle JML. So that's exactly the angle we're asked to find. Therefore, angle JML equals angle JKL, which is 109 degrees. Hence, the answer is C.

Wait, but why isn't there any other consideration? Like, could there be some other relationship because of the given side length? But the side length is ML=6. However, since we are dealing with angles, the side length may not affect the angle measure unless there's some other condition. Since in a parallelogram, the angles are determined by the shape, regardless of the side lengths. Unless it's a rhombus or something, but we don't know that. But even in general parallelograms, opposite angles are equal. So regardless of the side lengths, the angles remain as per the properties.

Therefore, the measure of angle JML is equal to angle JKL, which is 109 degrees. So the answer is C.
