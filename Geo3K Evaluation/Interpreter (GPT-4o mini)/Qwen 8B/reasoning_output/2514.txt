<think>
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, first, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out what's going on here. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have points G, I, J, K, H. The predicates mention several lines and a triangle. Let me note them down:

1. Triangle(G, I, J): So, there's a triangle connecting points G, I, and J.
2. Line(G, K): There's a line segment from G to K.
3. Line(K, H): Another line from K to H.
4. Line(H, I): From H to I.
5. Line(K, J): From K to J.
6. Line(J, I): From J to I.
7. Parallel(Line(K, H), Line(J, I)): The line segments KH and JI are parallel.

Additionally, we're given some lengths: GJ = 8, GH = 12, HI = 4. And we need to find KJ.

First, I should probably sketch a rough diagram to visualize the setup. Since there's a triangle G-I-J, so those three points form a triangle. Then there are other points connected via lines. Let me try to imagine or draw this mentally.

So, starting with triangle GIJ. Points G, I, J forming a triangle. Now, there's a point K such that there's a line from G to K (Line(G,K)), then another line from K to H (Line(K,H)). Also, Line(H,I) connects H to I. Then Line(K,J) connects K to J, and Line(J,I) is part of the original triangle. Also, the lines KH and JI are parallel.

Given that KH || JI. Also, we know the lengths: GJ is 8 units, GH is 12 units, and HI is 4 units. Need to find KJ.

Hmm. Let me think about how these lines connect. Let me try to map out the connections:

- Triangle GIJ: Points G, I, J. So sides are GI, IJ, JG.

But then there are other lines:

- Line GK connects G to K.

- Line KH connects K to H.

- Line HI connects H to I. So H is connected to I, which is part of the triangle.

- Line KJ connects K to J.

- Line JI is part of the triangle, since JI is one side of triangle GIJ.

Also, KH is parallel to JI.

Wait, maybe there's a trapezoid involved? Because KH is parallel to JI. So perhaps KHIJ forms a trapezoid? Or maybe some other shape?

Alternatively, considering that KH is parallel to JI, which is a side of the triangle. Maybe there's a transversal or something.

Let me try to consider coordinates. Sometimes assigning coordinates helps. Let me assign coordinates to the points to make it easier.

Let me place point I at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, since HI is 4 units, and H is connected to I. Suppose I put I at (0,0). Then H could be somewhere along the x-axis. Let me say H is at (a, 0), but since HI is length 4, then distance from H to I is 4. Wait, if I is at (0,0), then H would be at (x, 0), and HI is 4 units. Let me fix coordinates.

Let me assume I is at (0,0). Then, since Line(H, I) exists, H is connected to I. Let me set I at (0,0) and H at (4, 0) because HI = 4. Wait, but the length HI is given as 4. So yes, if I is at (0,0), then H is at (h_x, h_y) such that the distance between H and I is 4. But maybe choosing coordinates smartly can simplify things.

Alternatively, since KH is parallel to JI, which is a side of the triangle. Let me think about vectors. If KH is parallel to JI, then vector KH is scalar multiple of vector JI.

But perhaps using coordinate geometry would help. Let me proceed.

Let me assign coordinates:

Let’s take I at (0, 0).

Since HI = 4, and H is connected to I. Let me suppose H is at (4, 0). So I is at (0,0), H is at (4,0). Then, Line(H, I) is the horizontal line from (4,0) to (0,0).

Now, Line(K, H) connects K to H. Also, Line(K, J) connects K to J, and Line(J, I) connects J to I. Also, Line(K, H) is parallel to Line(J, I). Since Line(J, I) is from J to I, which is from J to (0,0). Let me denote J as some point (x, y). Then, Line(J, I) has direction vector (-x, -y). Similarly, Line(K, H) goes from K to H (which is (4,0)) so its direction vector is (H_x - K_x, H_y - K_y). Since they are parallel, their direction vectors must be scalar multiples.

Moreover, there's a line from G to K, and G is connected to J. Given that GJ = 8. Also, GH = 12. So the distance from G to H is 12. Let me try to define coordinates for G and K.

This seems complicated, but maybe manageable. Let me proceed step by step.

Let me first fix points I(0,0), H(4,0). Now, Line(J, I) is from J to I(0,0). Let me assume J is some point (p, q). Then, vector JI is from J(p,q) to I(0,0), so direction vector (-p, -q).

Line(K, H) is parallel to JI, so direction vector of KH must be same as JI. So direction vector of KH is proportional to (-p, -q). Therefore, if K is some point (k_x, k_y), then vector KH is (4 - k_x, 0 - k_y) which should be proportional to (-p, -q). So,

(4 - k_x)/(-p) = (0 - k_y)/(-q) => (4 - k_x)/p = (k_y)/q.

But without knowing p and q, this might not be helpful yet.

Also, there's a line from G to K, and from K to J. Also, GJ = 8, GH = 12. Let me see.

Point G is connected to J and to K. Also, GH = 12. So distance from G to H is 12. Let me denote G as (g_x, g_y). Then distance from G to H(4,0) is sqrt[(g_x -4)^2 + (g_y)^2] = 12. Also, distance from G to J(p, q) is 8: sqrt[(g_x - p)^2 + (g_y - q)^2] = 8.

But this seems too many variables. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, since KH || JI, maybe we can use similar triangles or ratios.

Because if two lines are parallel, then certain triangles may be similar.

Looking at the configuration: Lines KH and JI are parallel. So if we can find a transversal cutting these lines, maybe creating similar triangles.

For example, if we look at lines connecting K to J and G to K, and also G to J.

Wait, there's a triangle GJK? Not sure. Alternatively, since KH is parallel to JI, and H is connected to I, maybe there's a parallelogram or something.

Alternatively, think of triangle GJI and some relation with K.

Wait, since KH || JI, and H is connected to I. Let me think of the line KH being parallel to JI. So if I extend lines, maybe there's a translation or something.

Alternatively, since KH || JI, then the ratio of distances could be considered.

Another thought: If KH || JI, then the triangles formed by these lines might be similar.

Let me consider triangle KHI and triangle J... Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me think again. Let's consider the lines KH and JI are parallel. Let me imagine that line KH is part of a trapezoid with base JI.

Suppose we have two parallel lines: JI and KH. Then, if we can find the relationship between the lengths of these lines, and other parts.

But we don't know the length of JI. However, we do know that GJ = 8, which is the length from G to J. Also, GH = 12, which is from G to H.

Alternatively, maybe using vectors or coordinate geometry with more assumptions.

Let me try to assign coordinates again, making some assumptions to reduce variables.

Assume I is at (0,0), H is at (4,0). Let me assume J is at (0, b), making JI vertical. Wait, if I is at (0,0), and J is at (0,b), then JI is vertical line from (0,b) to (0,0). Then, line KH must be parallel to JI, so also vertical. Therefore, KH is vertical. So if KH is vertical, then K must lie somewhere along a vertical line passing through H(4,0). Wait, because KH is vertical, then H is at (4,0), and K is somewhere on the vertical line through H. Wait, but if KH is vertical, then K is directly above or below H. Let me suppose K is at (4, c). Then, line KH is from (4,c) to (4,0), vertical.

Then, since K is connected to J, which is at (0,b). So line KJ connects (4,c) to (0,b). Also, G is connected to K and to J. We know GJ=8 and GH=12.

Let me find coordinates for G. Since GH=12, and H is at (4,0), then G lies somewhere such that distance from G to (4,0) is 12. Also, G is connected to J(0,b), with distance GJ=8.

So, if I can write equations for G.

Let me denote G as (x,y). Then:

Distance from G to H(4,0): √[(x-4)^2 + (y-0)^2] = 12 → (x-4)^2 + y^2 = 144 ...(1)

Distance from G to J(0,b): √[(x-0)^2 + (y - b)^2] = 8 → x² + (y - b)^2 = 64 ...(2)

Subtract equation (2) from equation (1):

(x-4)^2 + y² - [x² + (y - b)^2] = 144 - 64 = 80

Expand:

(x² -8x + 16) + y² - x² - (y² - 2b y + b²) = 80

Simplify term by term:

x² -8x +16 + y² -x² - y² + 2b y - b² = 80

Combine like terms:

-8x +16 + 2b y - b² = 80

Rearranged:

-8x + 2b y = 80 -16 + b² → -8x + 2b y = 64 + b² ... (Equation A)

Hmm, but this introduces variable b, which is the y-coordinate of J. But I don't know the value of b yet. However, maybe there's another condition from the fact that K is connected to J and line KJ.

K is at (4, c), J is at (0, b). So line KJ connects (4,c) to (0,b). What else do we know about this line? Well, we might need another condition. Perhaps the slope of KJ relates to other elements?

Alternatively, maybe there's another constraint from the triangle GIJ. Since Triangle(G, I, J) exists, so points G, I, J are non-collinear. But I'm not sure yet.

Alternatively, since we have point K connected to G, and we need to find KJ. Wait, KJ is the distance from K(4,c) to J(0,b), which is √[(4-0)^2 + (c - b)^2] = √[16 + (c - b)^2]. So our target is to find this value. But we need to relate c and b somehow.

But how? Let me think.

We also have that line KJ is connected, but I don't see immediate relations unless there's another condition. Wait, but earlier, we had Equation A involving x, b, and c. But we still have too many variables.

Perhaps we need to find relations between c and b? Let me check if there's anything else.

Wait, the original triangle is GIJ. So points G, I, J. We already placed I at (0,0), J at (0,b), and G is at (x,y). So the triangle GIJ has vertices at G(x,y), I(0,0), J(0,b). 

Is there any other condition? For instance, does the line KJ intersect with other lines? Or is there a property I missed?

Wait, the problem mentions Line(K, J) and Line(J, I). So Line(J, I) is from J(0,b) to I(0,0), which is the vertical line we assumed earlier. And Line(K, J) is from K(4,c) to J(0,b). 

Also, since KH is parallel to JI. JI is vertical, so KH must also be vertical, which we've already used to place K at (4,c).

So, all conditions seem satisfied with this setup. But how do we find the value of KJ?

Let me recap. We need to find √[16 + (c - b)^2], which depends on b and c. How can we find these variables?

From Equation A: -8x + 2b y = 64 + b². But we also have other equations involving x and y.

But we have two equations (equations 1 and 2) involving x and y, but they depend on b. This seems underdetermined. Maybe there's another condition?

Wait, maybe there's something about the position of point K? Since there's a line from G to K. Is there any condition on that line? Like, maybe it's part of a triangle or something else?

Alternatively, maybe the line GK intersects with other lines? Or perhaps there's a relation between G, K, and other points?

Wait, the problem says "Line(G, K)" exists, but no other constraints. Unless there's something missing here. Maybe I need to use the fact that the lines KH and JI are parallel, which we already used by setting KH vertical.

Wait, but in this coordinate system, JI is vertical, KH is vertical. So that's handled. Are there any other constraints?

Wait, the problem states that there's a triangle GIJ, so points G, I, J are not colinear. Which is true as long as G isn't on the line IJ. Since IJ is vertical from (0,0) to (0,b), G(x,y) cannot be on that line. So that's okay.

But I still need to find the value of KJ. It seems stuck. Maybe I need to find relations between b and c?

Wait, maybe there's a relation from the line KJ and the rest of the figure. For example, if there's a parallelogram or something?

Alternatively, maybe the slopes of lines KG and others?

Wait, let me think differently. Since KH is parallel to JI, and JI is vertical, so KH is vertical. Hence, K is vertically aligned with H. So K is (4, c) as before.

Now, let's think about triangle GKI or something. Wait, but I don't know where K is relative to G. However, we know GH = 12, and GJ = 8. Let me try to express G in terms of b and c.

But I'm stuck here. Maybe I need to find relations between b and c.

Wait, perhaps there's a similarity between triangles? Since KH is parallel to JI, which is part of the triangle GIJ. So if we consider triangles involving KH and JI.

For example, if we consider triangle GKH and something else. Wait, but I don't see immediately.

Alternatively, since KH || JI, then the ratio of distances from G to these lines might be related.

Alternatively, using vectors. Let me consider the vector from G to K and from G to J.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Maybe there's another approach.

Let me recall that in problems involving parallel lines and triangles, similar triangles often come into play. Let me try to see if there are similar triangles here.

Since KH || JI, and assuming that lines GK and GI intersect at some point... Wait, but I don't know where GK is.

Wait, if KH is parallel to JI, then the distance between these two lines might be related to the heights of the triangle. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think of translating the line JI to KH. Since they are parallel, the translation vector would be from JI to KH. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think of the line KJ. Since K is on the vertical line through H, and J is on the vertical line through I. Wait, in my coordinate system, J is on the vertical line through I (since I is at (0,0) and J is at (0,b)), and K is on the vertical line through H (at (4,0)). So KJ connects (4,c) to (0,b). 

Maybe the slope of KJ is (b - c)/(0 - 4) = (b - c)/(-4). But I don't know if that helps.

Wait, but what about the line from G to K? G is connected to K, and we know GH = 12. Let me assume that G lies somewhere such that the distance from G to H(4,0) is 12, and to J(0,b) is 8.

But without knowing b, I can't compute exact values. Maybe I need to express variables in terms of each other.

Let me go back to Equations 1 and 2:

Equation 1: (x-4)^2 + y^2 = 144

Equation 2: x² + (y - b)^2 = 64

Expanding Equation 2:

x² + y² - 2b y + b² = 64

From Equation 1: (x² -8x +16) + y² = 144 → x² + y² = 144 +8x -16 = 128 +8x

Plugging x² + y² from Equation 1 into Equation 2:

(128 +8x) - 2b y + b² = 64

Which simplifies to:

128 +8x - 2b y + b² = 64 → 8x - 2b y = 64 -128 -b² → 8x -2b y = -64 -b² → rearranged as:

8x = 2b y -64 -b² → x = (2b y -64 -b²)/8

But I don't know the value of b or y. So this doesn't help directly.

Wait, but what about the line from G to K? Point G(x,y), K(4,c). So the line GK connects G to K. Is there any condition on this line? The problem statement doesn't give any other direct info about it, except that it exists. So unless there's an implicit assumption, like maybe it's part of a triangle or something, but I don't see it.

Alternatively, maybe there's a relation between c and b from the line KJ? For example, if there's a condition that makes certain angles or slopes equal? But I don't see it.

Wait, but maybe we can use the fact that K is connected to J and the line KJ. Since we need to find KJ, which is √[16 + (c - b)^2], and we need to find this value. But how?

Alternatively, maybe there's a relation between b and c from the triangle GIJ? Let me think. In triangle GIJ, points G(x,y), I(0,0), J(0,b). The sides are GI, IJ, and GJ. We know GJ = 8, IJ is length b (from (0,0) to (0,b)), and GI is distance from G(x,y) to I(0,0): √(x² + y²).

But we also have from Equation 1: x² + y² = 128 +8x (from earlier). Wait, no, earlier we said x² + y² = 128 +8x from expanding Equation 1. Wait, Equation 1 was (x-4)^2 + y^2 = 144, which expands to x² -8x +16 + y² = 144 → x² + y² = 144 +8x -16 = 128 +8x.

Yes. So GI is √(x² + y²) = √(128 +8x).

But in triangle GIJ, the sides are GI, IJ, and GJ. So by triangle inequality, but I don't know if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinates to find relations. But I still don't see how to get to KJ.

Wait, maybe there's another condition from the line KJ. Since KJ is connected, and we have point J at (0,b) and K at (4,c), maybe there's a relation between c and b from the fact that KH || JI. Wait, we already used that to set KH vertical. So maybe there's no new info there.

At this point, I feel like I'm missing something. Let me think again about the given data. We have GH = 12, GJ = 8, HI = 4. Need to find KJ.

Wait, HI is 4, which we've already used by placing H at (4,0) with I at (0,0). So HI is 4 units.

Let me think about triangle GHI? Wait, G is connected to H and I? No, G is connected to H and to K. Wait, but there's no direct connection between G and I mentioned. Unless there's a line GI, but the problem doesn't specify that. Wait, the initial triangle is GIJ, so GI is a side of the triangle. So yes, GI is present.

In triangle GIJ, we have sides GI, IJ, and GJ. We know GJ = 8, IJ is length b (from earlier), and GI is √(128 +8x). But without more info, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, but maybe there's a relation between x and b from the line GK? Since G is connected to K, but no other conditions. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made wrong assumptions by placing J at (0,b). Maybe I should choose different coordinates.

Alternative approach: Let's consider the triangle GIJ, with IJ being a base. Let me assume IJ is horizontal for simplicity. Wait, but earlier I assumed JI was vertical. Maybe that complicates things. Let me try a different coordinate system.

Let me place point I at (0,0), point J at (a, 0), so that IJ is horizontal. Then, since Line(K, H) is parallel to Line(J, I), which is horizontal. So KH is also horizontal. Thus, K and H must be on the same horizontal line.

Also, given that HI = 4, so distance from H to I is 4. If I is at (0,0), then H could be at (c, d) such that distance from H to I is 4. But since KH is horizontal, and K is connected to H, then K is horizontally aligned with H.

Let me try this:

Set I at (0,0), J at (a, 0). Then IJ is horizontal. Line(J, I) is from J(a,0) to I(0,0), which is the horizontal line. So KH is parallel to this, hence horizontal. So line KH is horizontal. Let me denote H as (h_x, h_y), and since KH is horizontal, K must be at (k_x, h_y), since it's on the same horizontal line as H.

Also, GH = 12, and GJ = 8.

Let me denote G as (g_x, g_y). Then, distance from G to H(h_x, h_y) is 12: sqrt[(g_x - h_x)^2 + (g_y - h_y)^2] = 12.

Distance from G to J(a,0) is 8: sqrt[(g_x - a)^2 + (g_y - 0)^2] = 8.

Also, Line(K, J) connects K(k_x, h_y) to J(a, 0). Need to find KJ, which is sqrt[(a - k_x)^2 + (0 - h_y)^2].

But how to find this value?

But we also have Line(K, H) is horizontal, so K is (k_x, h_y). Also, there's a line from G to K. But again, not enough info.

However, we also have the triangle GIJ, so G, I, J are connected. So GI is from G(g_x, g_y) to I(0,0), and GJ is from G to J(a,0). 

But without knowing a, h_x, h_y, k_x, g_x, g_y, this seems too many variables.

But perhaps there's a relation due to the parallelism. Let me think about the slopes. Since KH is parallel to IJ, which is horizontal, so KH is horizontal. So the y-coordinate of K and H are the same. So H is (h_x, h_y), K is (k_x, h_y).

Now, since there's a line from K to J(a, 0), and from G to K. Also, GJ is 8, GH is 12.

Let me assume that the line from G to K passes through some point, but I don't see it.

Alternatively, maybe using mass point or ratios?

Wait, since KH || IJ, which is horizontal, and IJ is part of the triangle GIJ. Maybe there's a trapezoid KHIJ, with KH || IJ. So it's a trapezoid with bases KH and IJ, and legs HK and IJ? Wait, no, IJ is a base, and KH is another base. The other sides are HI and KJ? Or something else.

Wait, in trapezoid KHIJ, the sides are KH, HI, IJ, and JK. But HI is given as 4, and IJ is length a. KH is some length, and JK is what we need to find.

But in a trapezoid, the lengths of the bases and the legs are related, but without knowing angles or heights, it's hard to proceed. But maybe using the formula for area or something?

Alternatively, since KH || IJ, the distance between these two lines is constant. Let me call this height h. Then, the area of the trapezoid would be (KH + IJ) * h / 2. But I don't know the area.

But maybe we can relate it to the triangles. For example, if we consider the triangles formed by extending lines.

Alternatively, since we know GH = 12 and GJ = 8, maybe using similar triangles.

Let me think: If KH || IJ, then triangles GKH and GIJ might be similar? Let me check.

If lines KH and IJ are parallel, and if G is a common vertex, then triangles GKH and GIJ could be similar if the corresponding angles are equal. Let me verify.

For similarity, we need corresponding angles to be equal. Since KH || IJ, then angle at G is common to both triangles. Also, angle at K and angle at I would be equal because of the parallel lines. So triangles GKH ~ GIJ by AA similarity.

If that's the case, then the ratio of sides would be equal.

Let me confirm this. If KH || IJ, then angle GKH is equal to angle GIJ (corresponding angles), and angle G is common. So yes, triangles GKH and GIJ are similar.

Therefore, the ratio of similarity would be GK/GI = KH/IJ = GK/GI.

Wait, but we need to find KJ, which is the side opposite to the angle at G in triangle GKH. Wait, no. Let me clarify.

In triangle GKH, the sides are GK, KH, and HG. In triangle GIJ, the sides are GI, IJ, and GJ.

If they are similar, then the correspondence would be:

Triangle GKH ~ Triangle GIJ.

So:

GK corresponds to GI,

KH corresponds to IJ,

and HG corresponds to GJ.

Wait, but HG is not directly given. Wait, HG is the distance from H to G, which is given as 12. And GJ is 8.

So if the similarity ratio is r, then:

GH / GJ = KH / IJ = GK / GI.

So GH / GJ = 12 / 8 = 3/2.

Thus, KH / IJ = 3/2, and GK / GI = 3/2.

But we need to find KJ. Wait, KJ is not directly a side of the similar triangles. However, maybe we can find KJ using other relations.

Wait, in triangle GKH, the side KH corresponds to IJ. So KH = (3/2)*IJ.

But IJ is the length of IJ in triangle GIJ. What is IJ?

In triangle GIJ, IJ is the length from I to J. But we don't know its length yet. But we know GJ = 8, and GH = 12. Let me think.

Wait, in triangle GIJ, using the Law of Cosines or something? But without knowing angles or other sides, it's tricky. However, if we can express IJ in terms of other quantities.

Alternatively, since we have the similarity ratio, let me denote IJ as x. Then KH = (3/2)x.

But we also know that in the trapezoid KHIJ, the side HI is 4. How is HI related to the trapezoid?

Wait, HI is the side from H to I, which is given as 4. In the trapezoid KHIJ, HI is one of the legs, and KJ is the other leg. Wait, but in a trapezoid, the legs are the non-parallel sides. So if KH and IJ are the bases, then the legs are HI and KJ.

But in this case, HI is given as 4. If the trapezoid has bases KH and IJ, and legs HI and KJ, then the lengths of the legs are HI = 4 and KJ (what we need to find). But how does that help us?

But if we can relate the legs to the bases via some formula. However, without knowing the height or angles, it's difficult.

But if we use the similarity ratio, we have GH / GJ = 3/2, so GH = 3/2 * GJ = 3/2 * 8 = 12, which matches the given GH = 12. So that checks out.

So the similarity ratio is 3/2. So, KH = (3/2) * IJ.

But what is IJ? IJ is the length from I to J in triangle GIJ. Let me denote IJ as x. So KH = (3/2)x.

But how to find x?

Well, in triangle GIJ, we know GJ = 8, and we need to relate it to IJ. But we need more information. However, if we can use the fact that GH = 12, and GH is related to the trapezoid.

Wait, in the trapezoid KHIJ, the side HI is 4, and the side KJ is what we need to find. Also, the height of the trapezoid would be the perpendicular distance between the bases KH and IJ. Let me denote this height as h.

But how to relate this to other quantities?

Alternatively, using the Pythagorean theorem in some way. Let me consider the legs of the trapezoid. If the trapezoid has bases KH and IJ, and legs HI and KJ, then if it's a right trapezoid, we could use right triangles. But we don't know if it's right.

Alternatively, using the law of cosines in triangle GHI or something.

Wait, let me think about triangle GHI. We know GH = 12, HI = 4, and we need to find GI. But wait, GI is a side of triangle GIJ, which we might relate to IJ.

But how?

Wait, in triangle GIJ, we have sides GI, IJ, and GJ = 8. If we can find GI and IJ, we could use the Law of Cosines or something.

But how to find GI?

GI is the distance from G to I. Let me recall from earlier in the coordinate system approach, we had GI = √(x² + y²), but without knowing x and y, it's hard. But maybe using the similarity.

From the similar triangles, we have GK / GI = 3/2. So GK = (3/2) GI.

But what is GK? It's the distance from G to K. Let me think.

But we also know that GH = 12. Is there a relationship between GK and GH?

In the trapezoid KHIJ, point K is connected to H, and G is connected to K. So GH is the distance from G to H, and GK is from G to K. But unless there's a relation between these, I don't know.

Wait, but if we consider triangle GKH, where GH = 12, KH = (3/2) IJ, and GK = (3/2) GI. But without knowing GI or IJ, this seems stuck.

But maybe using the Law of Cosines in triangle GKH?

In triangle GKH, we have sides GH = 12, GK = (3/2) GI, KH = (3/2) IJ. But we don't know the angles.

Alternatively, let me consider the entire figure. Since triangles GKH ~ GIJ with ratio 3/2, then all corresponding sides are in ratio 3/2. So, for example, the side KJ in triangle GKH corresponds to what in triangle GIJ?

Wait, in triangle GKH, the sides are GK, KH, and GH. In triangle GIJ, the corresponding sides would be GI, IJ, and GJ. So:

GK corresponds to GI,

KH corresponds to IJ,

GH corresponds to GJ.

So the ratio is GH / GJ = 12 / 8 = 3/2, as before.

So, in triangle GKH, the side KH corresponds to IJ in triangle GIJ. So KH = (3/2) IJ.

But what about KJ? In triangle GKH, KJ is not a side. Wait, KJ is the side from K to J, which is not part of triangle GKH. But KJ is part of the trapezoid KHIJ, and it's one of the legs.

But maybe there's a way to relate KJ to other sides. Let me think about triangle KJH? Or something else.

Wait, since KH is parallel to IJ, and HI is 4, and KJ is what we need to find, perhaps using the properties of trapezoids. In a trapezoid, the midsegment (the segment connecting the midpoints of the legs) is equal to the average of the two bases. But I don't know if that helps here.

Alternatively, if we drop a perpendicular from K to IJ, forming a right triangle. But without knowing the height, it's unclear.

Wait, let me think again about the similar triangles. If triangles GKH ~ GIJ with ratio 3/2, then the corresponding angles are equal. So angle at K in triangle GKH corresponds to angle at I in triangle GIJ. 

But how to use this? Let me consider the coordinates again, but this time with the similarity.

Let me assume that triangle GKH ~ triangle GIJ with ratio 3/2. So, if I can express the coordinates accordingly.

Let me denote the similarity transformation. Let me say that triangle GKH is a scaled-up version of triangle GIJ by factor 3/2.

But I need to define the scaling center. Since both triangles share the vertex G, the similarity would be centered at G.

So, if we scale triangle GIJ by factor 3/2 from point G, we would get triangle GKH.

Thus, point K is the image of point I under this scaling, and point H is the image of point J under this scaling.

Wait, let me explain. If the similarity maps GIJ to GKH, then:

- G maps to G (same point),
- I maps to K,
- J maps to H.

Wait, but that would mean the scaling factor is determined by the ratio of distances from G. So, the distance from G to I scales to the distance from G to K, and similarly for J to H.

So, if the ratio is 3/2, then GK = (3/2) GI and GH = (3/2) GJ.

But we know GH = 12 and GJ = 8. So, GH = (3/2) GJ → 12 = (3/2)*8 → 12 = 12. Which checks out. So this confirms the similarity ratio.

Thus, this suggests that point K is the image of point I under a homothety (scaling) centered at G with ratio 3/2. Similarly, point H is the image of point J under the same homothety.

So, this gives us a way to find the position of K and H in terms of G, I, and J.

Now, since H is the image of J under this scaling, we can find the coordinates of H in terms of G and J.

Let me formalize this. A homothety (scaling) centered at G with ratio r transforms any point X to a point X' such that GX' = r * GX.

Here, r = 3/2. So, for point J, its image H satisfies GH = (3/2) GJ.

But we know GJ = 8, so GH = 12, which matches the given GH = 12. So this confirms it.

Similarly, point K is the image of I under this homothety, so GK = (3/2) GI.

Now, we need to find KJ, which is the distance between K and J.

To find KJ, let's express K in terms of G and I, and J in terms of G and J.

Let me denote vectors. Let me represent points as vectors from G.

Let me set G as the origin for simplicity. Let me assume G is at (0,0). Then, the position vectors of I and J are vectors i and j respectively.

Under the homothety centered at G (origin) with ratio 3/2, the image of I is K = (3/2)i, and the image of J is H = (3/2)j.

Now, the distance from K to J is |K - J| = |(3/2)i - j|.

But we need to find this magnitude.

But we know the distance from G to J is |j| = 8, and the distance from G to I is |i|. Let me denote |i| = GI.

But we need to relate |i| and |j| using the given information.

Wait, but we also know that HI = 4. Let's compute HI in terms of i and j.

Point H is (3/2)j, and point I is i. So the distance between H and I is |H - I| = |(3/2)j - i| = 4.

So, we have:

|(3/2)j - i| = 4.

Also, we know |j| = 8 (since GJ = 8).

Let me square both sides of the equation:

|3/2 j - i|^2 = 16.

Expanding this:

(3/2 j - i) · (3/2 j - i) = 16.

Which is:

(9/4)|j|^2 - 3 j · i + |i|^2 = 16.

We know |j| = 8, so |j|^2 = 64.

Let me denote |i|^2 as GI², and j · i as the dot product between vectors i and j.

So:

(9/4)(64) - 3(j · i) + GI² = 16.

Calculate 9/4 * 64 = 144.

So:

144 - 3(j · i) + GI² = 16 → GI² - 3(j · i) = 16 - 144 = -128.

But we need another equation to relate GI² and j · i. Let me think.

In triangle GIJ, we have sides GI, IJ, and GJ = 8. By the Law of Cosines:

IJ² = GI² + GJ² - 2 * GI * GJ * cos(theta), where theta is the angle at G between GI and GJ.

But IJ is the distance between I and J, which is |i - j|.

So, |i - j|² = GI² + GJ² - 2 GI * GJ cos(theta).

But also, |i - j|² = (i - j) · (i - j) = |i|² + |j|² - 2i · j = GI² + 64 - 2i · j.

So, combining with the previous expression:

GI² + 64 - 2i · j = GI² + 64 - 2 GI * 8 cos(theta) → which implies that i · j = GI * 8 cos(theta).

But this might not help directly. Let me think if there's another relation.

Wait, from earlier, we had GI² - 3(i · j) = -128.

Let me denote i · j as x. Then:

GI² - 3x = -128 → GI² = 3x - 128.

But also, from the Law of Cosines:

|i - j|² = GI² + 64 - 2x.

But |i - j| is IJ, which is a side of the triangle. However, we don't know its length. But maybe we can relate it to something else.

Alternatively, since we have the expression for |3/2 j - i|² = 16, and we have expressed it in terms of GI² and x.

Wait, let me revisit that equation:

GI² - 3x = -128 → GI² = 3x - 128.

And from the Law of Cosines, |i - j|² = GI² + 64 - 2x.

But |i - j| is IJ, which is a side of the triangle. However, we don't know its length. But maybe we can find it using other means?

Wait, but we also know that in the trapezoid KHIJ, HI = 4, which we've already used. But I don't see a direct link.

Alternatively, let me think about the value of |3/2 j - i|² = 16, which expanded to 144 - 3x + GI² = 16 → GI² - 3x = -128.

But from the Law of Cosines, |i - j|² = GI² + 64 - 2x.

Let me call |i - j|² as Y, so Y = GI² + 64 - 2x.

But we also have GI² = 3x - 128. Substituting into Y:

Y = (3x - 128) + 64 - 2x = x - 64.

So Y = x - 64.

But Y is |i - j|² = IJ², which is positive. So x - 64 > 0 → x > 64.

But x is i · j, which is the dot product between vectors i and j. Also, from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, i · j ≤ |i||j| = GI * 8.

But I don't know GI.

But maybe we can find another relation. Let me think.

We also have that KJ is the distance between K and J, which in this coordinate system is |K - J| = |(3/2)i - j|.

Let me calculate this squared: |3/2 i - j|² = (3/2)^2 |i|² - 2*(3/2)*i · j + |j
