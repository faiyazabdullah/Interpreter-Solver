MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a quadrilateral ABCD, and some given predicates about angles. Let me start by writing down all the given information so I don't miss anything.

First, the problem says there's a RightAngle at Angle(A,B,C). That means angle ABC is a right angle, 90 degrees. Then another RightAngle at Angle(B,C,D), so angle BCD is also a right angle. Wait, but hold on—quadrilaterals can sometimes have more than two right angles, depending on their type. But maybe these right angles are part of a larger structure?

Next, there's an equality involving angles. The measure of angle DAB (which is angle at A, between points D, A, B) equals 3 times x. And the measure of angle ADC (at point D, between A, D, C) equals x. So angle DAB = 3x and angle ADC = x. 

Our goal is to find the measure of angle A of quadrilateral ABCD, which is angle DAB, right? Because angle A would be the angle at vertex A, which is formed by points D, A, B. So that's angle DAB, which is given as 3x. But wait, maybe I need to check if there are other angles involved here.

Wait, quadrilaterals have four angles. Let me recall that the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is always 360 degrees. So, if I can express all the angles in terms of x and set up an equation, maybe I can solve for x and then find angle A.

But first, let me make sure about the angles mentioned. We have two right angles: angle ABC and angle BCD. Then angles at A and D are given as 3x and x respectively. Wait, but angle ADC is at D, so that's one of the angles. Let me visualize the quadrilateral ABCD.

Let me sketch mentally: Points A, B, C, D connected in order. So sides AB, BC, CD, DA. Now, angle at B is ABC, which is a right angle. Angle at C is BCD, another right angle. So, if I imagine quadrilateral ABCD with two adjacent right angles at B and C. Hmm, but how does that shape look?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a rectangle or something else, but since there are only two right angles, maybe it's not a rectangle. Wait, but rectangles have four right angles. So this must be a different quadrilateral.

Now, angles at A and D: angle DAB (at A) is 3x, and angle ADC (at D) is x. Let me note that. So total angles: angle A = 3x, angle B = 90°, angle C = 90°, angle D = x. Sum of angles should be 360°, so adding them up:

3x + 90 + 90 + x = 360  
Combine like terms: 4x + 180 = 360  
Subtract 180: 4x = 180  
Divide by 4: x = 45°  

So then angle A is 3x = 3*45 = 135°. Therefore, the measure of angle A is 135 degrees. Looking at the answer choices, that's option C. 

Wait, but before I conclude, let me double-check. Are there any missing angles or misinterpretations?

Wait, angle ADC is at D, so that's angle ADC. In quadrilateral ABCD, the angles are at each vertex. So angle at A is DAB, angle at B is ABC, angle at C is BCD, and angle at D is ADC. So yes, those are the four angles. So adding them gives 3x + 90 + 90 + x = 4x + 180 = 360. Solving gives x=45, hence angle A is 135°, which is option C. 

But wait, could there be another way to interpret the angles? For example, maybe angle ADC isn't one of the internal angles? No, because in a quadrilateral, each angle is at a vertex. So angle ADC is indeed at D, between points A, D, C. So that's correct.

Another thing to consider: Is there any possibility that the quadrilateral is self-intersecting or something else? But unless specified, we assume it's a convex quadrilateral. Also, the presence of two right angles doesn't necessarily conflict with that.

Therefore, my conclusion is that angle A is 135°, so the answer is C.
