MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. 

So, the problem says there's a triangle ABC. Then it mentions a right angle at Angle(B,C,A). Wait, that notation might mean the angle at point C between points B and A? Because in angle notation, the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(B,C,A) would be the angle at point C formed by points B, C, A. So that means triangle ABC has a right angle at C. Therefore, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at C. 

Next, the measure of Angle(A,B,C) is 30 degrees. Let me confirm: Angle(A,B,C) is the angle at point B, between points A, B, C. Wait, but if the triangle is right-angled at C, then the angles at A and B must add up to 90 degrees. But here, they say the measure of angle at B is 30 degrees. Wait, hold on. Let me make sure.

Wait, the angle notation: Angle(A,B,C) is the angle at point B. So that's angle ABC. So in triangle ABC, angle at B is 30 degrees. Since the triangle is right-angled at C, the other two angles (at A and B) should sum to 90 degrees. Given that angle at B is 30 degrees, then angle at A would be 60 degrees. That makes sense because in a right-angled triangle, if one angle is 30°, the other non-right angle is 60°.

Now, the sides: LengthOf(Line(A,C)) = x. Line AC is one side. LengthOf(Line(B,C)) = 14√3. That's BC. And LengthOf(Line(A,B)) = y. So AB is y. We need to find x, which is AC.

Since we have a right-angled triangle at C, we can use trigonometric ratios or the Pythagorean theorem. Let me think about the angles. Let's label the triangle properly.

In triangle ABC, right-angled at C. So sides:

- Opposite angle B (which is 30°): AC. Because angle at B is 30°, so the opposite side is AC.

- Adjacent to angle B: BC. Which is adjacent to angle B.

- Hypotenuse is AB.

Alternatively, maybe I should assign labels correctly. Let me draw it mentally. Point C is the right angle. So sides:

- BC and AC are the legs.

- AB is the hypotenuse.

Given that angle at B is 30°, so angle ABC = 30°. In such a triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. Specifically, in a 30-60-90 triangle, the side opposite 30° is half the hypotenuse. Wait, let's recall:

In a right-angled triangle where one angle is 30°, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. The side opposite 30° is the shortest leg, then the other leg is √3 times that, and the hypotenuse is twice the shortest leg.

But here, angle at B is 30°, so the side opposite angle B is AC. So AC is opposite 30°, making it the shorter leg. Then BC is adjacent to angle B, which would be longer leg. And AB is hypotenuse.

So if BC is 14√3, which is the longer leg. Let me check the ratio. In a standard 30-60-90 triangle, the longer leg is √3 times the shorter leg. So if BC is longer leg, then BC = AC * √3. Therefore:

BC = AC * √3 → 14√3 = x * √3 → Solving for x gives x = 14. So that would make x = 14, which is answer A. But wait, let me verify again.

Alternatively, maybe I got the sides mixed up. Let me re-express.

Let me denote:

- Right angle at C, so sides AC and BC are legs, AB is hypotenuse.

- Angle at B is 30°, so angle ABC = 30°, so the side opposite angle B is AC. Therefore, AC is opposite 30°, so AC is the shorter leg. The longer leg is BC, adjacent to angle B. So yes, BC is longer leg.

Therefore, the ratio between longer leg (BC) and shorter leg (AC) is √3. Hence:

BC / AC = √3 → 14√3 / x = √3 → Multiply both sides by x: 14√3 = √3 x → Divide both sides by √3: x = 14. Therefore, x is 14, which corresponds to answer A.

Alternatively, another way: Using trigonometry. For angle at B, which is 30°, tan(angle B) = opposite / adjacent = AC / BC. So tan(30°) = AC / BC. Tan(30°) is 1/√3. Therefore:

1/√3 = x / (14√3)

Multiply both sides by 14√3:

x = (14√3) * (1/√3) ) = 14. Same result. So x=14. So answer A.

Wait, but let me check if there's another possibility. Suppose instead that angle at B was 60°, but the problem states that angle at B is 30°, so that's fixed. Also, the hypotenuse AB would be twice the shorter leg. So AB = 2x. But since we aren't asked about AB, which is y, perhaps that's not needed.

Thus, the answer is A, 14.
