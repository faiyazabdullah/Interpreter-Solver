MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rhombus ABCD, and we're given that AB equals 2x plus 3, and BC equals 5x. We need to find the measure of angle AEB. Wait, hold on—the problem mentions point E, but there's no diagram provided. Hmm, maybe I missed something? Let me check again.

Wait, the original problem says "Find m∠AEB." But without knowing where point E is located, how can we determine this angle? In a rhombus, diagonals bisect each other at right angles, but unless E is defined as one of the intersection points of the diagonals or some other specific point, we can't proceed. Maybe there's a standard assumption here? Or perhaps E is the intersection of the diagonals?

Let me think. In a rhombus, the diagonals intersect at 90 degrees and bisect each other. If E is the intersection point of the diagonals AC and BD, then angle AEB would be formed at that intersection. Since diagonals in a rhombus are perpendicular, angle AEB would be 90 degrees. But wait, the answer choices include 90 as option C. However, maybe there's more to it. Let me verify.

But first, let's make sure about the side lengths. Given that AB = 2x + 3 and BC = 5x. In a rhombus, all sides are equal. Therefore, AB must equal BC. So setting them equal: 2x + 3 = 5x. Solving for x, subtract 2x from both sides: 3 = 3x → x = 1. Then substituting back, AB = 2(1) + 3 = 5, and BC = 5(1) = 5. That checks out. So the sides are all length 5. 

Now, since all sides are equal, the rhombus has opposite angles equal and adjacent angles supplementary. But how does that relate to angle AEB? If E is the intersection of the diagonals, then the diagonals split the rhombus into four right triangles. Each diagonal divides the rhombus into two congruent triangles. The diagonals also bisect the angles. So if E is the intersection point, then AE and BE are halves of the diagonals. But since the diagonals are perpendicular, angle AEB is 90 degrees. So regardless of the side lengths, as long as it's a rhombus, angle AEB would be 90 degrees. Therefore, the answer should be C. 

Wait, but why was the information about the sides given? Because maybe E isn't the intersection of the diagonals? But without knowing where E is, how could we determine the angle? The problem must assume that E is the intersection of the diagonals. Otherwise, there's insufficient data. Since the problem gives us side lengths, maybe they were meant to confirm that it's a rhombus? But even so, the angle depends on the structure of the rhombus. 

Alternatively, maybe E is another point? For example, sometimes problems refer to midpoints or other points. But in the absence of a diagram, the most common case is that E is the intersection of the diagonals. Hence, leading to angle AEB being 90 degrees. Therefore, the answer is C.
