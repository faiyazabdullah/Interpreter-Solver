<think>
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have several points and lines with some given lengths and right angles. The goal is to find the area of the figure. Let me start by breaking down the given information.

First, the points mentioned are A, B, C, D, E. Then there are lines connecting them: Line(A,B), Line(B,E), Line(E,D), Line(D,A), Line(B,C), and Line(A,C). Also, there are several RightAngle predicates and LengthOf equals specified.

Let me try to visualize the figure. Maybe I should sketch it out mentally. Starting with point A connected to B and D. Point B is connected to A, E, and C. Point E is connected to B and D. Point D connects back to A and E. Then there's Line(B,C) and Line(A,C). 

Wait, so maybe there are two triangles here? Let me think. Points A, B, C form a triangle since there's Line(A,B), Line(B,C), and Line(A,C). Also, points B, E, D form another structure because of Line(B,E), Line(E,D), and Line(D,A). But also, there's Line(D,A) which connects D to A. Hmm. Also, there are right angles at various places: Angle(A,B,C), Angle(B,E,D), Angle(A,D,C), and Angle(B,A,C). Wait, Angle(B,A,C) is the same as Angle(A,B,C)? Or is that different?

Wait, Angle(B,A,C) would be the angle at point A between points B and C. Wait, but the first one says RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)) which is the angle at point B between points A and C. Because in standard notation, Angle(X,Y,Z) is the angle at Y. So Angle(A,B,C) is the angle at B between A and C. Similarly, Angle(B,A,C) would be the angle at A between B and C. Oh, wait, but the given RightAngle(Angle(B,A,C)) is another right angle at point A. So there are two right angles at point B and point A?

Also, there are other right angles: Angle(B,E,D) is the angle at E between B and D, and Angle(A,D,C) is the angle at D between A and C. So these right angles suggest that certain sides are perpendicular. Let me note all the right angles:

1. At point B: Angle(A,B,C) is right. So AB ⊥ BC?
Wait, AB is from A to B, BC is from B to C. So the angle at B between AB and BC is right. Therefore, AB is perpendicular to BC. Since AB has length 5, and BC has length 4 (from Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)),4)). Also, there's another right angle at point A: Angle(B,A,C) is right. That means BA is perpendicular to AC. Wait, BA is from B to A, and AC is from A to C. So BA and AC meet at A, forming a right angle. Therefore, BA ⊥ AC. So BA is perpendicular to AC, making triangle ABC a right triangle with legs BA=5 and AC=4? Wait, but hold on, the length of AC is given as 4. Wait, the given LengthOf(Line(A,C)) is 4. So AC is 4. But BA is 5. So triangle ABC has AB=5, AC=4, and right angle at A. Wait, but in that case, BC would be the hypotenuse. Wait, but according to the given, the length of BC is 4. Wait, that seems conflicting. Because if AB=5, AC=4, and right angle at A, then BC would be sqrt(AB² + AC²) = sqrt(25+16)=sqrt(41) ≈6.4. But the given says LengthOf(Line(B,C)) is 4. That contradicts unless my understanding is wrong.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the given data. The problem states:

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)),5): AB = 5
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)),4): BC = 4
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C)),4): AC = 4
- RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)): This is the angle at B between A and C. So AB ⊥ BC.
- RightAngle(Angle(B,A,C)): This is the angle at A between B and C. So BA ⊥ AC.

So in triangle ABC, we have two right angles? Wait, how can a triangle have two right angles? That's impossible. Unless the triangle isn't a regular triangle. Wait, but if both angles at B and A are right angles, then that would make the sum of angles exceed 180 degrees. Which is impossible. Therefore, there must be something wrong with my interpretation.

Wait, maybe I misread the angle notations. Let me check again. 

Angle(A,B,C) is the angle at B between A and C. So that's angle ABC. And Angle(B,A,C) is the angle at A between B and C, which is angle BAC. So if both angles ABC and BAC are right angles, then triangle ABC has two right angles, which is impossible. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. So either I'm misunderstanding the notation, or there's a typo in the problem. Alternatively, maybe the figure isn't a single triangle but a combination of figures.

Alternatively, perhaps the figure is not a triangle but includes other elements. Let me consider all the lines again. There are more than just triangle ABC. For example, there's Line(D,A), Line(E,D), Line(B,E), Line(B,C), Line(A,C), etc. So the entire figure may consist of multiple polygons. Let me try to map out all connections:

Points:

- A connected to B, D, C.
- B connected to A, E, C.
- C connected to B, A.
- D connected to E, A.
- E connected to B, D.

Additionally, there's Line(A,C) which connects A and C, and Line(B,E), Line(E,D), Line(D,A).

So the figure might be a pentagon or composite shape. Let me try to imagine:

Starting from point A, connected to B and D. From B, connected to A, E, and C. From E, connected to B and D. From D, connected to E and A. From C, connected to B and A. Additionally, there's Line(A,C), which is already part of the connections. Also, Line(B,C) is present. 

Now, considering the right angles:

At point B: Angle(A,B,C) is right. So AB is perpendicular to BC. Also, Angle(B,A,C) is right, which would mean BA is perpendicular to AC. Wait, but if AB is perpendicular to BC and BA is perpendicular to AC, then BC and AC would be parallel? Because AB is perpendicular to both. Wait, but then AC and BC would be parallel? But then in triangle ABC, if AB is perpendicular to BC and BA is perpendicular to AC, that suggests that AC is parallel to BC. But if that's the case, then points A, B, C would lie such that AC || BC, which would imply that angle at B is 90 degrees, and angle at A is also 90 degrees, making triangle ABC impossible. So there's definitely something wrong here. Perhaps the problem has overlapping lines or the figure isn't a simple polygon?

Wait, maybe the figure isn't a triangle but includes other parts. Let me think about each right angle:

RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)): At point B, between A and C. So AB ⊥ BC.

RightAngle(Angle(B,A,C)): At point A, between B and C. So BA ⊥ AC.

So at point A, BA is perpendicular to AC. So BA and AC are perpendicular. So triangle ABC has a right angle at A. Therefore, AB and AC are perpendicular. However, earlier, there was a right angle at B between A and C, implying AB and BC are perpendicular. So combining these, AB is perpendicular to both AC and BC. That would mean that AC and BC are both perpendicular to AB, hence AC || BC. But that would require that AC and BC are colinear, which they aren't. Hence, contradiction again. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the right angles are not within triangle ABC but in other parts of the figure. Let me check again the list of right angles:

RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)) → angle at B between A and C (so AB ⊥ BC)

RightAngle(Angle(B,E,D)) → angle at E between B and D (BE ⊥ ED)

RightAngle(Angle(A,D,C)) → angle at D between A and C (AD ⊥ DC)

RightAngle(Angle(B,A,C)) → angle at A between B and C (BA ⊥ AC)

So, in addition to the previous contradictions in triangle ABC, there's also right angles at E, D, and A. 

This suggests that the figure consists of multiple right-angled components. Let me try to model this step by step.

Starting with point B connected to A and E. Since angle at B between A and C is right (angle ABC), and angle at B between A and E is... Well, there's no mention of angle at B involving E. Wait, there's Line(B,E), so BE is a line. Also, there's Line(B,C), so BC is a line. So at point B, there are three lines: BA, BE, and BC. Wait, but BA is connected to A, BE to E, and BC to C. So the angles at point B would involve these lines.

But the given right angles at B are Angle(A,B,C) (which is angle between BA and BC) being right, and also Angle(B,A,C) (which is angle at A between B and C). Wait, no—Angle(B,A,C) is angle at A. So that's separate.

Let me focus on the right angles first. 

At point B: angle between BA and BC is right (since Angle(A,B,C) is right). So BA ⊥ BC. Also, at point A, angle between BA and AC is right (Angle(B,A,C) is right), so BA ⊥ AC. Thus, BA is perpendicular to both BC and AC. That implies that AC and BC are both perpendicular to BA, hence AC || BC. But then AC and BC would be parallel, but they share point C. Therefore, AC and BC would need to be the same line, but that's impossible unless C is on AC and BC, which would collapse the triangle. So this seems contradictory. 

Therefore, there must be a miscalculation or misinterpretation. Let me check the original problem again.

Original Predicates:

- RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)): This is angle at B between A and C → AB ⊥ BC.

- RightAngle(Angle(B,A,C)): This is angle at A between B and C → BA ⊥ AC.

So BA is perpendicular to both BC and AC. Thus, AC and BC are both perpendicular to BA, hence they are parallel. But since they meet at point C, this implies that AC and BC are the same line, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that either the problem contains an inconsistency, or I'm misinterpreting the angle notations.

Wait, could it be that Angle(B,A,C) refers to a different configuration? Like, maybe it's not in triangle ABC? Or perhaps the points are arranged differently. For instance, maybe the figure isn't a triangle ABC but includes other points?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the problem. Let me assume that the problem is correctly formulated and proceed. Maybe the figure isn't a triangle but involves other elements. Let me try to consider coordinates.

Let me assign coordinates to the points to resolve the conflicts. Let's place point B at origin (0,0) for simplicity.

Since BA is perpendicular to BC and BA is also perpendicular to AC, let me try to define coordinates accordingly.

Let me assume BA is along the x-axis. So point B is at (0,0). Let’s say point A is at (a, 0) since BA is horizontal. Now, BA is perpendicular to BC, so BC must be vertical. Let’s suppose point C is at (0, c) since BC is vertical upwards from B. But also, BA is perpendicular to AC. AC goes from A(a,0) to C(0,c). The slope of AC is (c - 0)/(0 - a) = -c/a. For BA (which is along x-axis from B(0,0) to A(a,0)) to be perpendicular to AC, their slopes must multiply to -1. The slope of BA is 0 (horizontal), so AC must be vertical. Wait, but if BA is horizontal, then AC needs to be vertical to be perpendicular. But AC goes from A(a,0) to C(0,c). To be vertical, AC must be a vertical line, which requires that x-coordinate of A and C are the same. But A is at (a,0) and C is at (0,c), so unless a=0, which would make A coincide with B, which isn't allowed. Hence, contradiction again.

This suggests that there's an error in the problem setup, but assuming the problem is valid, perhaps the figure isn't planar? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the right angles are not in the same plane? Unlikely. 

Alternatively, perhaps the given lengths are inconsistent with the right angles? Let me check the lengths. Given that AB = 5, BC = 4, and AC = 4. If AB is 5, BC is 4, and AC is 4, and angle at B is right, then by Pythagoras, AB² + BC² should equal AC² if angle at B is right. But AB² + BC² = 25 + 16 = 41, while AC² is 16. Not equal. So that's impossible. Hence, this suggests that the given data is inconsistent. But since this is a problem to solve, maybe there's a misunderstanding in interpreting the right angles.

Wait, maybe the right angles are not in triangle ABC but elsewhere. Let me recheck the right angles:

- RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)) → angle at B between A and C (so AB ⊥ BC)
- RightAngle(Angle(B,E,D)) → angle at E between B and D (BE ⊥ ED)
- RightAngle(Angle(A,D,C)) → angle at D between A and C (AD ⊥ DC)
- RightAngle(Angle(B,A,C)) → angle at A between B and C (BA ⊥ AC)

Ah! So the last right angle is at A between B and C, meaning BA ⊥ AC. So BA is perpendicular to AC, and AB is perpendicular to BC. So BA is perpendicular to both AC and BC. Therefore, AC and BC are both perpendicular to BA, so they must be parallel. But since they meet at C, this implies that AC and BC are the same line, which is impossible. Hence, there's a fundamental inconsistency. 

But since this is a problem given to solve, perhaps the figure isn't a triangle but has other elements. Let me try to consider all the points and lines again. Maybe the figure is composed of multiple right-angled figures.

Let me attempt to build the figure step by step:

Start with point B. Connect to A (length AB=5), connect to E (line BE), connect to C (BC=4). Then from E, connect to D (ED), and from D, connect to A (DA). Also, connect A to C (AC=4). Also, there's a right angle at D between A and C (AD ⊥ DC). So AD is perpendicular to DC. Also, right angle at E between B and D (BE ⊥ ED). 

So, let me try assigning coordinates again, carefully.

Let me set up coordinate system with point B at (0,0). 

Since there's a right angle at B between A and C (AB ⊥ BC), and a right angle at A between B and C (BA ⊥ AC). Let me try to define points such that these conditions are met.

Assume BA is along x-axis, so point B is (0,0), point A is (5,0) since AB=5.

Now, BA is from B(0,0) to A(5,0). The right angle at A between B and C implies that AC is perpendicular to BA. Since BA is horizontal, AC must be vertical. So from A(5,0), moving vertically upward or downward. Let's assume upward for simplicity. Let's say point C is at (5, y). But we also know that AC has length 4. So distance from A(5,0) to C(5,y) is |y| = 4. So y=4 or -4. Let's take y=4, so C is at (5,4).

Now, BC is supposed to have length 4. Point B is at (0,0), point C is at (5,4). Distance BC is sqrt((5-0)^2 + (4-0)^2) = sqrt(25 + 16) = sqrt(41) ≈6.4, but the given length of BC is 4. Contradiction again. Hence, this setup is invalid. 

But the problem gives BC=4, so our assumption must be wrong. Therefore, there's inconsistency. But since the problem exists, perhaps the right angles are not in triangle ABC but elsewhere? Or maybe my initial assumptions are incorrect.

Alternative approach: Let's forget the triangle ABC and look for other structures. 

We have points A, B, C, D, E with multiple lines. Let me try to see if the figure is a combination of rectangles or other shapes. 

Given that there are right angles at E, D, and A. Let's consider the right angles:

- At E: Angle(B,E,D) is right → BE ⊥ ED.
- At D: Angle(A,D,C) is right → AD ⊥ DC.
- At B: Angle(A,B,C) is right → AB ⊥ BC.
- At A: Angle(B,A,C) is right → BA ⊥ AC.

So, starting from point B, connected to A and E. BE is perpendicular to ED, so from E, ED is perpendicular to BE. From D, DA is perpendicular to DC. Also, from A, AC is perpendicular to BA. 

Maybe we can construct this step by step with coordinates.

Let me try setting up coordinates again. Let me choose coordinates where possible.

Let me place point B at (0,0). 

Since there's a right angle at B between A and C (AB ⊥ BC), and a right angle at A between B and C (BA ⊥ AC), this suggests that BA is perpendicular to both BC and AC, leading to AC || BC, which is impossible unless they are the same line. Hence, this suggests that the figure has other elements beyond triangle ABC. 

Perhaps the figure is not a single polygon but a combination of shapes. For example, maybe there's a rectangle or square involved. 

Looking at the lines: Line(B,E), Line(E,D), Line(D,A), which forms a quadrilateral BEDA? Or maybe a polygon with points B-E-D-A. Also, Line(A,C) connects A to C. 

Let me try to model this. Assume that from point B(0,0), draw BE and BC. Since BE is connected to E, and ED is connected to D, and DA is connected to A. Also, AD is connected to D and A, and DC is connected to D and C. 

Let me try assigning coordinates step by step.

Start with point B at (0,0). Let's assume BE is along the positive x-axis. So point E is at (e, 0), but we don't know e yet. 

Since there's a right angle at E between B and D (Angle(B,E,D)), so BE ⊥ ED. Since BE is along x-axis from B(0,0) to E(e,0), then ED must be vertical. So from E(e,0), moving up or down. Let's assume upwards for simplicity. So point D is at (e, d), where d > 0.

Then, Line(D,A) connects D(e,d) to A. Also, there's a right angle at D between A and C (Angle(A,D,C) is right), so AD ⊥ DC. So from D(e,d), AD is connected to A, and DC is connected to C. So DC must be perpendicular to AD. 

Also, Line(A,C) connects A to C, and we know AC has length 4. 

Also, there's Line(A,B) with length 5, so distance from A to B is 5. Let's denote point A as (x,y). 

From point B(0,0) to A(x,y): distance AB = 5 → √[(x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2] = 5 → x² + y² = 25.

Also, from point A(x,y) to C(p,q): distance AC = 4 → √[(p-x)^2 + (q-y)^2] = 4.

Also, there's a right angle at A between B and C (Angle(B,A,C) is right), so BA ⊥ AC. Vector BA is from A to B: (0 - x, 0 - y) = (-x, -y). Vector AC is from A to C: (p - x, q - y). Their dot product should be zero: (-x)(p - x) + (-y)(q - y) = 0 → -xp + x² - yq + y² = 0 → x² + y² = xp + yq. But x² + y² = 25, so 25 = xp + yq. 

Additionally, there's a right angle at B between A and C (Angle(A,B,C) is right), so AB ⊥ BC. Vector AB is from B to A: (x, y). Vector BC is from B to C: (p, q). Dot product should be zero: x*p + y*q = 0. 

But from above, we had x² + y² = xp + yq. And from the right angle at B, xp + yq = 0. So substituting, x² + y² = 0 → x² + y² = 0, which implies x=0 and y=0, but point A cannot be at B. Contradiction again. 

This suggests that there's an inconsistency in the problem's given data. But since this is a problem posed to be solved, perhaps I'm missing something. 

Wait, maybe the right angles are not all in the same plane? Or perhaps some of the lines are not straight? No, the problem specifies lines, so they are straight. 

Alternatively, perhaps the figure includes overlapping lines or self-intersections? 

Alternatively, perhaps the right angles are not in the way I'm thinking. For example, maybe Angle(A,B,C) is not the internal angle at B but something else? 

Alternatively, maybe the figure is three-dimensional, but the problem mentions geometric predicates without specifying, so likely it's planar.

Alternatively, maybe there's a typo in the given lengths. For example, if BC were sqrt(41) instead of 4, it would fit. But given that the problem provides BC=4, I must work with that. 

Let me try to ignore the contradiction in triangle ABC and focus on the rest of the figure. Perhaps the area can be computed by combining other regions.

We have lines BE, ED, DA, forming a quadrilateral BEDA? Or maybe a rectangle? Let me consider the right angles at E and D. 

At E: BE ⊥ ED. At D: AD ⊥ DC. Also, DA is connected to A and D. Let me try to find relations between these.

Assume that from point D, AD is perpendicular to DC. So DC is perpendicular to AD. Let me consider coordinates again. Suppose D is at (e,d), and A is at (x,y). Then vector AD is (x - e, y - d). Vector DC is (c_x - e, c_y - d). Their dot product should be zero: (x-e)(c_x - e) + (y-d)(c_y - d) = 0.

Also, from earlier, we have AB=5, AC=4, BC=4, and the right angles at B and A causing inconsistencies. Perhaps I should focus on the other parts of the figure.

Let me consider the right angles at E and D. Since BE ⊥ ED and AD ⊥ DC, perhaps these form rectangles or squares. 

For example, if BE is horizontal and ED is vertical, then BEDA could be a rectangle if DA is parallel to BE and DC is parallel to ED. But without knowing more, it's hard to tell. 

Alternatively, since BE ⊥ ED, and AD ⊥ DC, perhaps there are rectangles or right triangles involved. 

Let me try to calculate coordinates step by step, even though there's a contradiction in triangle ABC. Maybe the area comes from other parts.

Let me assume that despite the contradiction in triangle ABC, the rest of the figure can be determined.

From earlier, I placed B at (0,0), A at (5,0) (assuming AB=5). Then, due to the right angle at A between B and C (BA ⊥ AC), AC must be vertical. So from A(5,0), move up to C(5,4) since AC=4. Now, BC is from B(0,0) to C(5,4), which has length sqrt(5² +4²)=√41, but the problem says BC=4. So this doesn't align. But if I force BC=4, then where is C?

Let me suppose that BC=4. So from B(0,0) to C(x,y), distance is 4: x² + y² = 16. Also, since AB is from (0,0) to (5,0), and BA is perpendicular to AC, so AC must be vertical. So C must be directly above A(5,0), so C is (5, k), and AC has length 4 → distance from A(5,0) to C(5,k) is |k| = 4 → k=±4. Let's take k=4, so C is (5,4). Then BC is from (0,0) to (5,4), which has length sqrt(25 + 16) = sqrt(41), which conflicts with BC=4. So this suggests that the given BC=4 is impossible under these constraints. 

This indicates that there's an inconsistency in the problem statement. But since this is a problem to solve, perhaps I should reinterpret the right angles. Maybe the right angles are not all in the same triangle? Let me check the other right angles.

There's a right angle at E: BE ⊥ ED. Let's assume BE is a horizontal line from B(0,0) to E(e,0), and ED is vertical from E(e,0) to D(e, d). So D is at (e, d). Then, Line(D,A) connects D(e,d) to A. Also, there's a right angle at D between A and C: AD ⊥ DC. So from D(e,d), vector DA is (A_x - e, A_y - d), and vector DC is (C_x - e, C_y - d). These vectors must be perpendicular: (A_x - e)(C_x - e) + (A_y - d)(C_y - d) = 0.

Also, Line(A,C) has length 4, so distance from A to C is 4.

Additionally, Line(A,B) has length 5, so distance from A to B is 5.

But without knowing coordinates of A and C, it's challenging. Let me try to define variables.

Let me assume point A is at (x, y), point B is at (0,0), point E is at (e,0), point D is at (e, d), and point C is at (p, q).

Given:

1. AB = 5 → √(x² + y²) = 5 → x² + y² = 25.

2. BC = 4 → √(p² + q²) = 4 → p² + q² = 16.

3. AC = 4 → √((p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2) = 4 → (p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = 16.

4. Right angle at A between B and C: BA ⊥ AC. Vector BA is (x, y), vector AC is (p - x, q - y). Their dot product is x(p - x) + y(q - y) = xp - x² + yq - y² = 0 → xp + yq = x² + y² = 25.

5. Right angle at B between A and C: AB ⊥ BC. Vector AB is (x, y), vector BC is (p, q). Their dot product is xp + yq = 0. But from above, xp + yq = 25. So 25 = 0, which is impossible. 

Again, the same contradiction arises. This suggests that the problem as stated contains conflicting conditions, making it unsolvable. However, since this is a problem presented to solve, I must have misunderstood something. Let me revisit the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says: RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)) and RightAngle(Angle(B,A,C)). Are these two different angles? Let me confirm:

Angle(A,B,C) is at point B, between A and C.

Angle(B,A,C) is at point A, between B and C.

So these are two different angles, not necessarily in the same triangle. But in this scenario, they are in the same triangle ABC, leading to the contradiction. 

Maybe the figure isn't a triangle but has other elements. Let me consider that point C is not part of triangle ABC but is connected via other lines. Wait, but Line(B,C) is given, so it must be connected.

Another possibility: Maybe the figure includes multiple triangles, and the right angles are in different parts. For example, the right angle at B is in triangle ABC, and the right angle at A is in another triangle. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the figure is not a single connected shape, but the problem asks for the area of the entire figure, which could be the sum of areas of individual parts.

Let me try to focus on the parts that don't conflict. 

We have:

- Right angle at E (BE ⊥ ED).
- Right angle at D (AD ⊥ DC).
- Right angle at B (AB ⊥ BC).
- Right angle at A (BA ⊥ AC).

Let me try to calculate areas of parts where possible.

First, consider the right angle at E: BE ⊥ ED. Let's assume BE is horizontal, ED is vertical. Let's say BE has length 6 (given LengthOf(Line(B,E)) is 6). So from B(0,0) to E(6,0). Then ED is vertical, so from E(6,0) to D(6, d). Let's assume d is some value. 

Then, Line(D,A) connects D(6, d) to A. Also, there's a right angle at D between A and C: AD ⊥ DC. So from D(6, d), vector DA is (A_x - 6, A_y - d), and vector DC is (C_x - 6, C_y - d). Their dot product is zero: (A_x - 6)(C_x - 6) + (A_y - d)(C_y - d) = 0.

Also, Line(A,C) has length 4, so (A_x - C_x)^2 + (A_y - C_y)^2 = 16.

Also, Line(A,B) has length 5, so (A_x)^2 + (A_y)^2 = 25.

Also, Line(B,C) has length 4, so (C_x)^2 + (C_y)^2 = 16.

And there's a right angle at A between B and C: BA ⊥ AC. Vector BA is (A_x, A_y), vector AC is (C_x - A_x, C_y - A_y). Their dot product is A_x(C_x - A_x) + A_y(C_y - A_y) = A_x C_x - A_x^2 + A_y C_y - A_y^2 = 0. Which implies A_x C_x + A_y C_y = A_x^2 + A_y^2 = 25.

But from the right angle at B between A and C, vector AB (A_x, A_y) and vector BC (C_x, C_y) are perpendicular: A_x C_x + A_y C_y = 0. So combining this with the previous equation: 0 = 25, which is impossible. Again, the contradiction.

This suggests that the problem as given contains inconsistent conditions, making it unsolvable. However, since this is a problem meant to be solved, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the predicates. Let me re-read the problem.

Wait, the problem says: RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)), RightAngle(Angle(B,E,D)), RightAngle(Angle(A,D,C)), RightAngle(Angle(B,A,C)). So four right angles. Maybe the figure is a combination of multiple right-angled triangles and rectangles.

Let me try to consider each right angle separately and see if I can compute areas from them.

First, RightAngle(Angle(B,E,D)): at E between B and D. So triangle BED is right-angled at E. Given that BE=6 (from Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,E)),6)), and ED is some length. If I can find ED, then area of triangle BED is (BE * ED)/2.

Similarly, RightAngle(Angle(A,D,C)): at D between A and C. So triangle ADC is right-angled at D. If I can find AD and DC, then area is (AD * DC)/2.

Also, RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)): at B between A and C. So triangle ABC is right-angled at B. With AB=5, BC=4, so area would be (5*4)/2 = 10.

RightAngle(Angle(B,A,C)): at A between B and C. So triangle ABC is also right-angled at A. But this would require AB and AC to be perpendicular, and BC to be hypotenuse. But if AB=5, AC=4, then BC should be sqrt(5² +4²)=sqrt(41), but the given BC=4, which is inconsistent. 

However, if we ignore this contradiction and use the given BC=4, then in triangle ABC, if it's right-angled at B, then AB=5, BC=4, and AC=sqrt(5² +4²)=sqrt(41). But the problem says AC=4. So this is conflicting. 

But perhaps the area is the sum of areas of the right triangles and other parts. Let me try to calculate areas of the right triangles where possible.

Assuming that the figure includes the right triangles at B, E, and D.

For example:

- Triangle BED: right-angled at E, with BE=6. If ED is x, then area is (6*x)/2 = 3x.

- Triangle ADC: right-angled at D, with AD and DC. Let's say AD=y, DC=z, area is (y*z)/2.

- Triangle ABC: if it's right-angled at B, area is (AB*BC)/2 = (5*4)/2 = 10.

- Another right angle at A: triangle ABC right-angled at A, area would be (AB*AC)/2 = (5*4)/2 = 10. But this would double-count if it's the same triangle.

But since there's a contradiction in triangle ABC, perhaps the actual area is the sum of these parts, ignoring the contradiction. 

But how to find x, y, z?

Let me try to relate the parts. 

From point D, connected to A and C. AD is connected to A, and DC is connected to C. Also, Line(D,A) is part of the figure. Let me assume that AD is part of the right angle at D, so AD ⊥ DC. So if I can find AD and DC, I can get area of ADC.

But to find AD and DC, I need more info. Let me try to use the fact that Line(A,C) has length 4. If I can express AC in terms of AD and DC.

But since ADC is right-angled at D, AC is the hypotenuse of triangle ADC. So AC = sqrt(AD² + DC²). Given AC=4, so AD² + DC² = 16.

If I can find AD and DC, but I don't have their lengths. However, maybe AD is related to other parts.

From point D, connected to E and A. ED is part of the right triangle BED. If I can find ED, then maybe AD is related to ED.

But how? Without more information, it's difficult. 

Let me try to use the fact that Line(D,A) connects D to A. Let me assume that AD is some length, say m. Then DC is sqrt(16 - m²).

But without knowing m, I can't proceed. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between AD and BE. For example, if the figure is a rectangle or something.

Alternatively, since there's a right angle at D between A and C, and Line(D,A) is part of the figure, perhaps AD is connected to other parts.

Let me try to consider all the lines and see if there's a closed figure. 

The lines are:

- A-B
- B-E
- E-D
- D-A
- B-C
- A-C

So, the figure includes quadrilateral A-B-E-D-A (forming a quadrilateral), and also connects B-C and A-C. 

If I can find the area of the entire figure, it might be the sum of areas of the quadrilateral A-B-E-D-A and triangle B-C-A, but I need to ensure there's no overlap.

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to tell. Let me try to estimate.

Assuming that the area is composed of the right triangles at B, E, D, and possibly others. 

If I take the area of triangle BED (right-angled at E, BE=6, ED=x) as 3x.

Area of triangle ADC (right-angled at D, AD=m, DC=n, with m² + n² = 16) as (m*n)/2.

Area of triangle ABC (if it's right-angled at B, with AB=5, BC=4, area=10).

But this assumes that ABC is a right triangle, which conflicts with the other condition about the right angle at A. But if I proceed with this, the total area would be 10 + 3x + (m*n)/2.

But how to find x, m, and n?

Let me think about the connection between the points. Line(D,A) is part of the figure, and Line(A,C) is given. Also, Line(B,C) is given. 

Maybe there's a relation between ED and AD. For example, if D is connected to A and C, and ED is connected to D and B.

Let me assume that point D is such that AD is connected to A and D, and DC is connected to D and C. Since ADC is right-angled at D, and AC=4, then as before, AD² + DC² = 16.

If I can relate AD to ED. For example, if ED is part of a right triangle with BE=6, and if AD is part of another triangle.

But without more information, this is too vague. 

Alternatively, perhaps the entire figure is a combination of right triangles and the area can be calculated using given lengths.

Let me try to calculate the area of the right triangles where possible:

- Triangle BED: right-angled at E, with BE=6. If ED is x, area is 3x.

- Triangle ABC: if it's right-angled at B, area is (5*4)/2 = 10.

- Triangle ADC: right-angled at D, with AC=4, so area is (AD * DC)/2. But AD and DC are unknown.

But if I can find AD and DC, perhaps from other parts.

From point D, connected to A and C. Also, Line(D,A) is part of the figure. Let me assume that AD is connected to A, and from A, there's Line(A,C) with length 4. If ADC is right-angled at D, then AC is the hypotenuse, so AC = 4 = sqrt(AD² + DC²). So AD² + DC² = 16.

If I can find AD, perhaps from the connection to E. For example, if D is connected to E, and ED is part of the right triangle BED.

But how? If I assume that ED is part of a line from E to D, and D is connected to A. If I can find ED in terms of other lengths.

Alternatively, since Line(D,A) is connected, and Line(A,B) is 5, maybe there's a relation between AD and AB.

But without knowing the position of D, it's hard to say.

At this point, I realize that without resolving the contradiction in the given data, it's impossible to calculate the area. However, since this is a problem to solve, I'll proceed under the assumption that the given data is consistent and that there's a way to calculate the area.

Let me try to use the right angles and given lengths to find the area.

First, consider the right angle at B between A and C (triangle ABC, right-angled at B). Even though it conflicts with the other condition, let's proceed. Area is (AB * BC)/2 = (5*4)/2 = 10.

Next, consider the right angle at E between B and D (triangle BED, right-angled at E). BE=6, but ED is unknown. Let's call ED = x. Area is (6*x)/2 = 3x.

Next, consider the right angle at D between A and C (triangle ADC, right-angled at D). AC=4, so area is (AD * DC)/2. Let's call AD = y, DC = z, so y² + z² = 16.

Now, what about the right angle at A between B and C (triangle ABC, right-angled at A)? If this is true, then AC and AB are perpendicular, so area is (AB * AC)/2 = (5*4)/2 = 10. But this is the same as before, so it doesn't add new information.

Now, the total area might be the sum of these parts: 10 (from ABC) + 3x (from BED) + (y*z)/2 (from ADC). But how to find x, y, z?

Let me try to find relations between these variables. 

From point D, connected to A and C. Line(D,A) is part of the figure. Let me assume that AD is connected to A, and from A, there's Line(A,C) with length 4. Also, Line(D,C) is connected, and since ADC is right-angled at D, DC is perpendicular to AD. 

If I can find AD and DC in terms of other parts. Let me assume that AD is part of the line from D to A, and DC is from D to C. Also, from point B, there's Line(B,C) with length 4. 

But without more information, it's still unclear. 

Perhaps the figure is a composite of these right triangles. For example, the total area might be the sum of the areas of ABC, BED, and ADC. Assuming that these parts do not overlap.

If I assume that the area is 10 + 3x + (y*z)/2, but without knowing x and y*z, I can't proceed. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to find x using other information. For example, if Line(D,A) is connected to A, and Line(A,B) is 5, perhaps AD is part of a right triangle with AB.

But I need more relations. 

Alternatively, let's consider that Line(D,A) is connected to A, and Line(A,C) is connected to C. If ADC is right-angled at D, then AC is the hypotenuse, so AC=4. Also, from point B, Line(B,C) is 4, and Line(B,A) is 5. If I can find coordinates where these conditions are satisfied, even if there's a contradiction, perhaps I can calculate the area.

Let me try once more to assign coordinates, ignoring the contradiction.

Let me place B at (0,0). Let me assume that triangle ABC is right-angled at B, with AB=5, BC=4. So A is at (5,0), B at (0,0), C at (0,4). Then AC is from (5,0) to (0,4), length sqrt(5² +4²)=sqrt(41). But the problem says AC=4, which is not matching. So this is invalid.

But if I force AC=4, then where is C? Let me say A is at (5,0), and C is somewhere such that AC=4 and BA ⊥ AC. 

Vector BA is from A to B: (-5, 0). Vector AC is from A to C: (cx - 5, cy - 0). For BA ⊥ AC, their dot product is (-5)(cx - 5) + 0*(cy) = -5(cx - 5) = 0 → cx = 5. So C is at (5, cy), and AC length is |cy| = 4 → cy = ±4. Let's take cy=4, so C is at (5,4). Then BC is from B(0,0) to C(5
