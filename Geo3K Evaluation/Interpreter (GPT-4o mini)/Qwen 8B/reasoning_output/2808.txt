<think>
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, the question is asking us to find the value of x such that BE and AD are perpendicular. The given predicates involve several angles and points lying on certain lines. Let me start by breaking down the information step by step.

First, I need to parse all the given predicates. Let me list them out again:

1. Angle at B, between points F and C: Measure is 6x.
2. Angle at C, between points F and D: Measure is 3x.
3. Angle at A, between points F and D: Measure is 12y - 10.
4. Point B lies on line FN.
5. Point E lies on line FL.
6. Point F lies on line AD.
7. Point C lies on line FH.
8. Point D lies on line FM.

Wait, but how do these points relate? Maybe drawing a diagram would help, but since I can't draw, I'll have to visualize it. Let me note the key points and lines.

Points involved: A, B, C, D, E, F, H, L, M, N. Lines mentioned: FN, FL, AD, FH, FM. Also, there's point E on FL and point B on FN. Point F is on AD. Points C and D are on FH and FM respectively.

Now, the main goal is to make BE perpendicular to AD. Since F is on AD, maybe AD is a straight line passing through F. So AD is a line with F somewhere along it. Then BE needs to be perpendicular to AD. 

Let me think about the angles given. The first two angles are at points B and C involving point F. So angle at B (FBC?) is 6x, and angle at C (CFD) is 3x. Wait, the measure of angle BFC is 6x? Or is it angle at B, so maybe angle ABF? Wait, the way it's written is MeasureOf(Angle(B,F,C)) which means the angle at point F between points B and C. So angle BFC is 6x. Similarly, angle CFD is 3x. Because Angle(C,F,D) would be angle at F between C and D. So those are two angles at point F: one between B and C (angle BFC = 6x), another between C and D (angle CFD = 3x). Therefore, if we consider point F connected to B, C, D, then maybe those angles are adjacent?

Also, point F is on line AD. So line AD passes through F. So points A and D are on opposite sides of F? Or maybe F is between A and D? Not sure yet. But since point F is on line AD, then AD is a straight line with F somewhere on it. 

Then, there's the third angle: MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D)) is 12y - 10. That's the angle at F between A and D. But since F is on AD, the angle between A and D at F should be a straight line, meaning 180 degrees. Wait, but that contradicts unless... Wait, maybe the angle is not a straight line. Wait, if F is on line AD, then the angle between A-F-D would be a straight angle, i.e., 180 degrees. But according to the predicate, it's 12y - 10. Therefore, 12y - 10 = 180? Wait, but that would mean y = (190)/12 ≈ 15.83. But perhaps I'm misunderstanding the angle here. Maybe the angle isn't between A-F-D directly. Wait, the notation Angle(A,F,D) refers to the angle at point F formed by points A, F, D. So yes, that's the angle between FA and FD. But if F is on AD, then FA and FD are colinear, so they form a straight line. Hence, the angle should be 180 degrees. But according to the predicate, it's 12y - 10. Therefore, equating that to 180 gives 12y - 10 = 180 → 12y = 190 → y = 190 / 12 ≈ 15.83. However, this seems odd because the other angles are given in terms of x. But maybe there's more to it. Perhaps the angle isn't a straight line? How could that be?

Wait, maybe point F is not between A and D? Suppose F is not on segment AD but extended beyond? For example, if A---F---D, then angle AFD is a straight line. But if F is outside the segment AD, then FA and FD would form some angle. Wait, but the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(F, Line(A,D)). So F is on line AD, which includes both directions. So depending on where F is, the angle AFD could be reflex or something else. But typically, angles are considered as less than 180 degrees unless specified otherwise. However, in standard problems, unless stated otherwise, angles are taken as non-reflex. Hmm. This suggests that perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Alternatively, maybe there's a typo in understanding the angle.

Alternatively, maybe the angle AFD is referring to a different configuration. Wait, let's re-examine the given predicates again. The third angle is MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D)) equals 12y - 10. So that's angle at F between A and D. But since F is on line AD, then points A, F, D are colinear, making the angle between FA and FD a straight angle. Unless there's a misinterpretation here. Wait, maybe the points aren't in order A-F-D. Suppose F is a point on line AD, but not necessarily between A and D. For instance, if A and D are on opposite sides of F. In that case, angle AFD would still be 180 degrees. So regardless of position, if F is on line AD, the angle between FA and FD is 180 degrees. So why does the predicate say 12y - 10? There must be something wrong here. Unless the angle is not between A-F-D but between A-F and something else? No, the notation is Angle(A,F,D), which is definitely the angle at F between A and D. 

This inconsistency suggests that maybe there's a misunderstanding. Let me check again. Are there other points involved? Like, maybe the angle is not just between A-F-D, but part of a larger structure? For example, if there are other lines connecting to F, creating multiple angles. 

Looking back, there are other points connected to F: B, C, E, H, L, M. So, for example, F is connected to B (since B lies on line FN), to C (since C lies on FH), to D (since D lies on FM), and also to E (E is on FL). So, F is connected to multiple lines: FN, FH, FM, FL. And also, F is on AD. 

So, considering all that, the angles around point F may add up to 360 degrees. Let me consider the angles at point F. We know two angles: angle BFC is 6x, angle CFD is 3x, and angle AFD is 12y - 10. But if F is on line AD, then angle AFD is 180 degrees. But if there are other angles at F, like angle between FA and FB, or others, then the sum of all angles around F would be 360 degrees. Wait, but how many angles are there?

Let me think. At point F, there are several lines: line AD (which contains F), line FN (with B on it), line FH (with C on it), line FL (with E on it), and line FM (with D on it). So, each of these lines passes through F. So the angles between these lines at point F would depend on how they're arranged. 

For instance, suppose line FN goes through B, line FL goes through E, line FH goes through C, line FM goes through D, and line AD goes through F. So, the arrangement of these lines around F determines the angles between them. 

Given that, we have angle BFC = 6x (between lines FB and FC), angle CFD = 3x (between lines FC and FD), and angle AFD = 12y - 10 (between lines FA and FD). Additionally, since F is on AD, lines FA and FD are parts of line AD. So, angle AFD is actually a straight line, hence 180 degrees. Therefore, combining this with the other angles, perhaps the angles around F sum up to 360 degrees. 

But wait, if angle AFD is 180 degrees, and angle CFD is 3x, then angle AFC would be angle AFD minus angle CFD? Wait, no. Let me clarify. 

Assuming that line AD passes through F, and line FM passes through D. So, line FM is the same as line FD? Because D is on line FM. So line FM is line FD extended? Similarly, line FH passes through C, so line FH is connected to point C. 

Therefore, the lines from F are: 

- Line FN (containing B)
- Line FL (containing E)
- Line FH (containing C)
- Line FM (containing D)
- Line AD (which is the same as line AF and FD?)

Wait, maybe the lines are overlapping. For example, line FM is the same as line FD, since D is on line FM. Similarly, line FH is the same as line FC? Or not necessarily. Wait, point C lies on line FH, so line FH contains point C. So line FH is separate from line FM unless C and D are aligned in some way. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, this is challenging. However, focusing on the angles at point F. 

We have angle BFC = 6x, angle CFD = 3x, and angle AFD = 12y - 10. But since F is on AD, angle AFD is a straight angle, so 180 degrees. Thus, 12y - 10 = 180 ⇒ 12y = 190 ⇒ y = 190/12 ≈ 15.83. But this seems messy. However, maybe the angle AFD is not 180 degrees because of the presence of other lines? Wait, no. If F is on line AD, then angle between FA and FD is a straight line. So unless there's another line intersecting at F, but even then, the angle between FA and FD remains 180 degrees. 

Wait, but perhaps the angle AFD is not referring to the straight line. Wait, could there be another angle at F involving A and D? For example, if there are other lines from F to A and D, but since F is on AD, those lines are the same as AD itself. 

Hmm. This seems contradictory. So maybe there's a mistake in interpreting the angle. Let me double-check. 

Angle(A,F,D): the vertex is F, with segments FA and FD. So if F is on line AD, then FA and FD are in opposite directions along line AD, forming a straight angle. Therefore, the measure should be 180 degrees. But the predicate says it's 12y - 10. Therefore, unless there's a miscalculation here, this implies that 12y - 10 = 180, leading to y = 190/12. 

But then, how does that fit with the other angles? For example, angle BFC is 6x, angle CFD is 3x. If we assume that angle BFC + angle CFD + ... equals some total. 

But if we consider that around point F, the sum of angles should be 360 degrees. Let me think. 

Suppose the lines from F are: 

- Line FB (through B on FN)
- Line FC (through C on FH)
- Line FD (through D on FM)
- Line FE (through E on FL)
- Line FA (part of AD)

But since F is on AD, line FA and FD are the same line extended in opposite directions. So, the angles between these lines would be determined by other lines intersecting at F. 

For example, between line FB and FC: angle BFC = 6x.

Between line FC and FD: angle CFD = 3x.

Between line FD and FE: ?

Between line FE and FA: ?

And between line FA and FB: ?

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to tell. However, if we consider that the total around point F is 360 degrees, then adding up all the angles around F should give 360. 

But we have angle BFC = 6x, angle CFD = 3x, and angle AFD = 12y - 10. Wait, but angle AFD is already 180 degrees. So if we take the angles around F, including angle AFD, which is 180 degrees, plus other angles. 

Wait, maybe the angles are arranged such that angle BFC (6x) and angle CFD (3x) are adjacent, forming a larger angle. For example, if lines FB, FC, FD are arranged in order around F. So from FB to FC is 6x, from FC to FD is 3x. Then the total from FB to FD is 6x + 3x = 9x. But since F is on AD, the angle between FB and FD would be part of the larger angles. 

Alternatively, perhaps angle AFD (the straight angle) is split into smaller angles. For example, angle AFE, angle EFC, angle CFD, etc. But without knowing the exact configuration, this is tricky. 

However, maybe we can use the fact that BE is perpendicular to AD. Since AD is a straight line, and BE is perpendicular to it. So BE forms a right angle with AD at their intersection point. 

Where do BE and AD intersect? Well, BE connects points B and E. B is on line FN, and E is on line FL. So BE is a line connecting B (on FN) to E (on FL). For BE to be perpendicular to AD, their intersection point must be such that the product of their slopes is -1 (if we were working in coordinate geometry). But since we don't have coordinates, we need to use angle relations. 

Alternatively, since AD is a straight line, and BE is perpendicular to it, then the angle between BE and AD is 90 degrees. 

Perhaps we can find expressions for angles involving BE and AD. 

But how? Let me think. 

Since F is on AD, and we have various lines through F. Maybe BE intersects AD at F? Or at some other point? 

Wait, BE connects B (on FN) and E (on FL). Unless F is the intersection point of BE and AD. But how do we know that? 

Alternatively, maybe BE passes through F? Because if BE is perpendicular to AD, and F is on AD, then BE might pass through F. But that's an assumption. 

Alternatively, maybe BE intersects AD at some point, say G, such that BG ⊥ AD. But without knowing where G is, it's difficult. 

But maybe we can find relations using the angles given. Let me think again about the angles at F. 

Earlier, we had a contradiction regarding angle AFD being 180 degrees. But perhaps the angle AFD is not the straight angle because there's another line involved. Wait, no. If F is on line AD, then AFD is a straight line. So the measure should be 180 degrees. Therefore, 12y - 10 = 180, so y = (180 + 10)/12 = 190/12 ≈ 15.83. 

But then, how does this help us? Maybe there are other angles at F. For example, angle between FB and FE, or between FE and FD, etc. 

Let me try to imagine the arrangement. Suppose at point F, there are several lines: 

- Line FN containing B
- Line FL containing E
- Line FH containing C
- Line FM containing D
- Line AD containing F

So, lines from F go to B, E, C, D, and along AD. 

Assume that the lines are arranged around F in some order. For example, starting from line FN (with B), then line FH (with C), then line FM (with D), and line FL (with E). But without knowing the exact order, it's hard to proceed. 

But we know two angles: angle BFC (at F between B and C) is 6x, and angle CFD (at F between C and D) is 3x. So, from point F, going from B to C to D, those angles are 6x and 3x. 

Additionally, angle AFD is 12y - 10. But since F is on AD, angle AFD is a straight line, so 180 degrees. Therefore, 12y - 10 = 180 ⇒ y = (190)/12 ≈ 15.83. 

But maybe there's another relationship. For example, if we consider the entire angle around F. Let's say that from line FB to line FD, the total angle is 6x (from B to C) + 3x (from C to D) = 9x. But since FD is part of AD, and FA is the extension of FD in the other direction. So, the full angle from FB to FA would be 9x + angle from D to A. Wait, but FA is along AD. 

Alternatively, if we consider that the angle from FB to FD is 9x, and then from FD to FA is 180 - 9x? Not sure. 

Alternatively, if the total around point F is 360 degrees, then the sum of all angles around F should be 360. 

So, assuming that the angles at F include:

- angle BFC = 6x
- angle CFD = 3x
- angle AFD = 180 degrees
- and possibly other angles between other lines (like between FE and something else).

But without knowing all the angles, this is challenging. However, since the question involves BE being perpendicular to AD, maybe we can relate angle between BE and AD. 

Let me consider that BE is perpendicular to AD. Since AD passes through F, if BE intersects AD at F, then the angle between BE and AD at F would be 90 degrees. So, if BE passes through F, then angle between BE and AD at F is 90 degrees. 

But how can we ensure that BE passes through F? Well, since B is on line FN and E is on line FL, unless lines FN and FL meet at F, which they do since both contain F. Wait, no. Wait, point B is on line FN, and point E is on line FL. But line FN and FL are two different lines passing through F. So, line FN contains B and F; line FL contains E and F. Therefore, lines FN and FL both pass through F. So, points B and E are on different lines through F. Therefore, BE is a line connecting B and E, which are on different lines through F. So, unless BE passes through F, but since F is not necessarily on BE. 

Wait, but if BE is perpendicular to AD, and AD passes through F, then the intersection point of BE and AD must be such that the angle between them is 90 degrees. Let's denote the intersection point as G. But without knowing where G is, it's hard to proceed. 

However, maybe there's a relation between the angles at F. For example, if BE is perpendicular to AD, then the angle between BE and AD at their intersection is 90 degrees. If that intersection point is F, then the angle between BE and AD at F is 90 degrees. 

So, if we can express the angle between BE and AD at F in terms of x and y, and set it to 90 degrees. 

To find that angle, we need to consider the angles around F. Let's assume that BE passes through F. If that's the case, then the angle between BE and AD at F is 90 degrees. 

How can we relate this? Let's think about the lines involved. 

Point B is on line FN, and E is on line FL. So, line BE connects B (on FN) and E (on FL). If BE passes through F, then F lies on BE. So, F is the intersection of BE and AD. 

In that case, the angle between BE and AD at F is 90 degrees. To find this angle, we can look at the angles formed by BE and AD. Since AD is a straight line, and BE is a line passing through F, the angle between BE and AD depends on the other angles at F. 

For example, if we consider line BE passing through F, then the angle between BE and AD would be determined by the angles between BE and other lines through F. 

But how to calculate this? Let me think. 

At point F, we have several lines: FN (with B), FL (with E), FH (with C), FM (with D), and AD. 

If BE passes through F, then line BE is the same as line joining B and E, which are on lines FN and FL respectively. So, BE is the line connecting B and E, which is the same as the line through F if F is on BE. 

But how can we confirm that? Well, if we assume that BE passes through F, then the angle between BE and AD at F is 90 degrees. So, the angle between BE and AD is 90 degrees. 

To find this angle, we can consider the angles between BE and other lines. For instance, if we can find the angle between BE and, say, line FH or FM, then relate it to the known angles. 

Alternatively, since we have angles involving lines through F, maybe we can express the angle between BE and AD in terms of the other angles. 

Let me try to consider that. Assume BE passes through F. Then, the angle between BE and AD at F is 90 degrees. This angle is formed by BE and AD. Since AD is a straight line, and BE passes through F, we can think of this angle as the angle between BE and one of the lines forming AD (either FA or FD). 

For example, if we consider line BE and line FD (part of AD), the angle between them is 90 degrees. 

But how to relate this to the known angles? 

Let me think about the angles around F. Suppose that line BE passes through F, then line BE is another line through F. So, we have line BE, which splits the plane around F into two halves. The angle between BE and AD is 90 degrees. 

If I can find the angle between BE and another known line, like line FH or FL, then maybe combine it with the known angles. 

But this is getting too vague. Let me try to find another approach. 

We have two angles at F: angle BFC = 6x and angle CFD = 3x. These are adjacent angles at F, forming a larger angle. So, the total angle from BF to DF is 6x + 3x = 9x. 

If we consider that line BE passes through F, then the angle between BE and line FD (which is part of AD) would be related to this 9x angle. 

But since BE is perpendicular to AD, which includes FD, the angle between BE and FD is 90 degrees. So, if we can express this angle in terms of x, we can set up an equation. 

But how? Let me think. Suppose that line BE creates an angle with FD. If BE is perpendicular to FD, then that angle is 90 degrees. 

But how to relate this to the existing angles. 

Alternatively, since BE connects B and E, which are on lines FN and FL respectively, and F is on AD, maybe we can find the angle between BE and AD by looking at the angles around F. 

For example, if we consider that line BE divides the plane around F into two parts. One part includes the angles involving B and E, while the other is the rest. 

But without knowing the exact positions of lines FN, FL, FH, FM relative to each other, it's challenging. 

Wait, perhaps there's another way. Since angle BFC is 6x and angle CFD is 3x, their sum is 9x. If these angles are adjacent, then the total angle from BF to DF is 9x. Now, if line BE is such that it forms a right angle with AD (which is the line containing DF), then the angle between BE and DF is 90 degrees. 

So, if we can relate the angle between BE and DF to the known angles. 

Assume that BE makes a 90-degree angle with DF. Let's consider that line BE passes through F, so at point F, the angle between BE and DF is 90 degrees. 

But how does this relate to the other angles? 

Suppose that at point F, the lines are arranged such that from line BF, we have angle BFC = 6x to FC, then angle CFD = 3x to FD. So, the total angle from BF to FD is 6x + 3x = 9x. Now, if BE is a line that makes a 90-degree angle with FD, then the angle between BE and FD is 90 degrees. 

But if BE passes through F, then the angle between BE and FD would depend on its position relative to other lines. 

For example, if BE is in the direction of line FL (which contains E), then the angle between BE (line FL) and FD is some value. But we don't know the relation between FL and the other lines. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle between BE and FD is supplementary to the sum of other angles. 

Wait, this seems too vague. Let me think differently. 

Since we have angle BFC = 6x and angle CFD = 3x, and angle AFD = 180 degrees. 

If we consider that from point F, the lines are arranged such that angle between BF and CF is 6x, between CF and DF is 3x, and between DF and AF is 180 degrees. Wait, but AF is part of AD. 

So, the total angle from BF to AF would be 6x + 3x + ... ? 

Wait, if we consider the full rotation around F, the sum of all angles should be 360 degrees. 

So, if we have angles:

- Between BF and CF: 6x
- Between CF and DF: 3x
- Between DF and AF: let's say α
- Between AF and BF: β

But since AF and DF are in a straight line, the angle between DF and AF is 180 degrees. Wait, but that's conflicting. 

Wait, this is confusing. Let me try to think of it as follows: 

At point F, the lines are:

- Line FN (contains B)
- Line FL (contains E)
- Line FH (contains C)
- Line FM (contains D)
- Line AD (contains F)

Assuming that lines FN, FL, FH, FM are all distinct and radiate from F. 

The angles between these lines are:

- Between FN (B) and FH (C): angle BFC = 6x
- Between FH (C) and FM (D): angle CFD = 3x
- Between FM (D) and something else: ?
- Between other lines: ?

But without knowing the full arrangement, it's hard to proceed. 

But since the problem asks about BE being perpendicular to AD, and BE connects B (on FN) and E (on FL), maybe we can focus on the angles involving lines FN and FL. 

Let me consider that line BE is the line connecting B (on FN) and E (on FL). So, line BE is the line through points B and E. If BE is perpendicular to AD, then the angle between BE and AD is 90 degrees. 

To find this angle, we can consider the angles at F. For example, if we can find the angle between BE and AD at F, which would be 90 degrees. 

But how to relate this to the given angles. 

Let me think that since BE is a line connecting B and E, which are on lines FN and FL respectively. So, the direction of BE is determined by the lines FN and FL. 

If we can find the angle between BE and AD, which is the line containing F. 

But since AD is a straight line, and BE is another line, the angle between them depends on their orientation. 

Maybe we can express this angle in terms of the angles around F. 

For example, if we consider the angle between BE and AD, it could be related to the angles between BE and other lines through F. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, this is challenging. 

Wait, perhaps we can use the fact that the sum of angles around F is 360 degrees. Let's assume that the angles around F include:

- angle BFC = 6x
- angle CFD = 3x
- angle between FD and some other line (say, FE)
- angle between FE and FA
- and other angles.

But since we don't know about other angles, maybe we need to find a relationship involving x. 

Wait, earlier, we found that 12y - 10 = 180, giving y = 190/12. But this seems messy. Maybe there's a mistake in assuming angle AFD is 180 degrees. What if instead, the angle AFD is not the straight angle because there's another line involved? 

Wait, no. If F is on line AD, then angle AFD is indeed a straight angle. So this suggests that 12y - 10 = 180. 

But then, how can we use this? Maybe there's another equation involving x and y. 

Let me think. If we assume that the sum of angles around F is 360 degrees, then:

Let's say the angles around F are:

- angle BFC = 6x
- angle CFD = 3x
- angle between FD and FE: let's call it z
- angle between FE and FA: w
- and other angles?

But since there are multiple lines through F, there might be more angles. However, without knowing all of them, it's hard to proceed. 

Alternatively, maybe the angles involving BE can be expressed in terms of x. 

For example, if BE is perpendicular to AD, then the angle between BE and AD is 90 degrees. Let's assume that this angle is formed at F, so the angle between BE and AD at F is 90 degrees. 

To find this angle, we need to consider the angles between BE and other lines. 

For instance, if BE is a line passing through F, then the angle between BE and AD is the angle between BE and either AF or DF. 

Suppose we consider the angle between BE and DF. Since AD contains DF, this angle is 90 degrees. 

But how to relate this to the given angles. 

Let me consider that line BE makes a 90-degree angle with DF. So, if we can express this angle in terms of the known angles. 

At point F, line BE creates some angle with DF. Let's say the angle between BE and DF is θ. We want θ = 90 degrees. 

But how to find θ? 

If we can express θ in terms of the other angles. 

For example, if BE is a line that passes through F, then the angle between BE and DF is determined by the other angles at F. 

Suppose that line BE is such that it forms a certain angle with other lines. 

For example, if line BE is in the same plane as lines FN and FL, and we know the angles at F involving those lines. 

But this is too abstract. Maybe I need to make assumptions about the configuration. 

Let me try to imagine that lines FN and FL are positioned such that the angle between them is something, and BE is part of that. 

But without more information, this is guesswork. 

Wait, perhaps there's another approach. Since BE is perpendicular to AD, and F is on AD, then the slope of BE times the slope of AD should be -1. But without coordinates, this is not helpful. 

Alternatively, using vectors or trigonometry. 

Alternatively, since BE is perpendicular to AD, the angle between BE and AD is 90 degrees. This angle can be related to the angles at F. 

Let me think: if I can find the angle between BE and AD at F, it should be 90 degrees. 

To find this angle, I need to find the angle between BE and AD. Since AD is a straight line, and BE is a line passing through F, this angle is determined by the direction of BE relative to AD. 

If I can express this angle in terms of the known angles at F, like 6x and 3x. 

For example, if line BE makes an angle with line BF, and we know the angle between BF and AD, then we can find the desired angle. 

But I'm stuck here. Let me try to recap. 

We have two angles at F: angle BFC = 6x and angle CFD = 3x. Their sum is 9x. If these angles are adjacent, then the total angle from BF to DF is 9x. 

If BE is perpendicular to AD, and AD contains DF, then the angle between BE and DF is 90 degrees. 

So, if we can relate the angle between BE and DF to the 9x angle. 

For example, if BE is such that it creates a 90-degree angle with DF, then the angle between BE and DF is 90 degrees. 

But how to express this angle in terms of the known angles. 

Let me assume that BE is a line that starts at B and goes through E, and since E is on line FL, which passes through F. So, line BE passes through F if and only if E is on line BE and F is on line BE. 

Wait, since E is on FL, and B is on FN, and F is on both FN and FL? No, F is on line FN (because PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(F,N)) means B is on line FN, and F is on line FN. Similarly, E is on line FL, and F is on line FL. So, lines FN and FL both pass through F. 

Thus, line BE connects B (on FN) and E (on FL). So, line BE passes through F if and only if F is on BE. 

But how do we know if F is on BE? It depends on the configuration. 

But since the question states that BE is perpendicular to AD, and F is on AD, it's likely that BE passes through F, because otherwise, the perpendicularity condition would require a specific position. 

So, assuming that F is on BE, then the angle between BE and AD at F is 90 degrees. 

Now, since F is on BE and AD, we can analyze the angles around F. 

At point F, we have lines:

- Line BE (passing through B and E)
- Line AD (passing through F)
- Line FH (containing C)
- Line FM (containing D)
- Line FN (containing B)
- Line FL (containing E)

Now, since F is on BE, and BE is perpendicular to AD, the angle between BE and AD is 90 degrees. 

Let me consider the angle between BE and AD. Since AD is a straight line, and BE is perpendicular to it, this angle is 90 degrees. 

Now, at point F, the angle between BE and AD is 90 degrees. This angle is formed by the intersection of BE and AD. 

Now, let's see if we can relate this to the other angles. 

Since BE passes through F, and AD passes through F, we can consider the angles formed at F by BE and other lines. 

For example, the angle between BE and line FH (which contains C) is some value, and the angle between BE and line FM (which contains D) is another value. 

But we know angle CFD = 3x, which is the angle between lines FC and FD. 

If I can relate the angle between BE and FD to this 3x angle. 

Let me try to visualize: 

At point F, line BE passes through F, and line FD is part of AD. The angle between BE and FD is 90 degrees. 

But FD is part of line AD, so this angle is between BE and AD. 

Now, if I can express this 90-degree angle in terms of other angles at F. 

For example, if I can find the angle between BE and some other line, and relate it to the known angles. 

Let me assume that line BE creates some angle with line BF (which is part of FN). Let's call this angle φ. 

Then, since angle BFC is 6x, which is the angle between BF and FC. 

If I can relate φ to 6x and 3x, then maybe I can find a relationship. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's still unclear. 

Alternatively, since BE passes through F, and we have angles involving BF and FC, maybe we can use the fact that the sum of angles around F is 360 degrees. 

Let me attempt this. 

At point F, the lines are:

- Line BF (part of FN)
- Line FC (part of FH)
- Line FD (part of FM)
- Line FE (part of FL)
- Line FA (part of AD)

Assuming that these lines are arranged around F in some order. 

We know:

- Angle BFC = 6x (between BF and FC)
- Angle CFD = 3x (between FC and FD)
- Angle AFD = 180 degrees (between FA and FD)
- Angle between FE and some other line?
- Angle between BE and other lines?

But since BE passes through F, it adds another line through F. Let's say line BE divides the plane into two parts. 

If we consider the total angles around F:

Sum of all angles around F = 360 degrees. 

Let me try to write equations. 

Let's assume that the angles at F are:

1. Angle between BF and FC: 6x
2. Angle between FC and FD: 3x
3. Angle between FD and some line (let's say FE): let's call it α
4. Angle between FE and some other line (maybe FA): let's call it β
5. Angle between FA and BF: γ

But since FA and FD are in a straight line, the angle between FA and FD is 180 degrees. So, the angle between FD and FA is 180 degrees. 

Wait, but if we have angle between FD and FA as 180 degrees, then the angle between FD and FA is 180 degrees. 

But how does this fit with the other angles? 

Let me think: if we have line FD and line FA, which are in a straight line, then the angle between them is 180 degrees. 

Now, the other angles at F are:

- From BF to FC: 6x
- From FC to FD: 3x
- From FD to FA: 180 degrees
- From FA to BF: ?

Wait, but this would imply that the total around F is 6x + 3x + 180 + ...? 

Wait, no. The total around F should be 360 degrees. Let's try to sum up the angles:

From BF to FC: 6x

From FC to FD: 3x

From FD to FA: 180 degrees

From FA to BF: let's say this is some angle δ

Total: 6x + 3x + 180 + δ = 360

So, 9x + 180 + δ = 360 → 9x + δ = 180 → δ = 180 - 9x

But δ is the angle between FA and BF. 

Now, if BE is a line passing through F, it would create another angle at F. Let's assume that line BE passes through F and creates an angle with one of the existing lines. 

For example, if line BE is between FA and BF, then it would create an angle with one of them. 

But since we want BE to be perpendicular to AD (which is along FD and FA), the angle between BE and AD is 90 degrees. 

Let me assume that line BE is such that it creates a 90-degree angle with AD. This angle would be between BE and either FA or FD. 

Let me consider that the angle between BE and FD is 90 degrees. Since FD is part of AD, this satisfies the condition. 

Now, if the angle between BE and FD is 90 degrees, then this angle is part of the angles around F. 

Let me think: the angle between BE and FD is 90 degrees. This angle is formed by line BE and FD. 

Now, if I can express this angle in terms of δ or other angles. 

For example, if BE is in the region between FA and FD, then the angle between BE and FD would be part of δ or something else. 

But this is too vague. Let me try to think of δ as the angle between FA and BF, which is 180 - 9x. 

If line BE is inside this angle δ, then the angle between BE and FA or BE and BF would be part of δ. 

But without knowing where BE is located, it's still unclear. 

However, since we need the angle between BE and FD to be 90 degrees, and FD is part of AD, maybe this angle is related to δ. 

For example, if the angle between BE and FD is 90 degrees, and δ is 180 - 9x, then maybe there's a relationship. 

Let me imagine that line BE is such that it splits δ into two parts, one of which is 90 degrees. 

For example, if δ is the angle between FA and BF, and BE is a line that creates a 90-degree angle with FD, then perhaps δ is composed of 90 degrees plus some other angle. 

But this is speculative. 

Alternatively, since the angle between BE and FD is 90 degrees, and FD is part of AD, then this angle is 90 degrees. This angle could be part of the total angles around F. 

But how to relate this to the other angles. 

Let me try to think of it this way: the total angle around F is 360 degrees. We have already accounted for 6x + 3x + 180 + δ = 360, where δ = 180 - 9x. 

Now, if line BE creates an additional angle, say, θ, which is 90 degrees. But this might not fit. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle between BE and FD is 90 degrees, which would mean that this angle is part of the existing angles. 

For example, if the angle between BE and FD is 90 degrees, and this angle is part of the angle δ (between FA and BF), then δ = 90 degrees + something. 

But without knowing where BE is, this is still unclear. 

I think I'm missing a key insight here. Let me revisit the given predicates and see if I missed anything. 

The third predicate is MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D)) = 12y - 10. Earlier, I assumed this was 180 degrees, leading to y = 190/12. But maybe this angle is not the straight angle. Why? Because perhaps the angle AFD is not between FA and FD, but between other lines? 

No, the notation Angle(A,F,D) is unambiguous: it's the angle at F between A and D, which means between FA and FD. So, if F is on line AD, then this angle should be 180 degrees. 

But this leads to y = 190/12, which is approximately 15.83. However, this doesn't seem to connect with the other angles. 

But maybe there's a mistake in assuming that angle AFD is 180 degrees. What if the angle is not between FA and FD but between other lines? No, the notation is clear. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle AFD is not the straight angle because F is not on AD? But the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(F, Line(A,D)), so F is on line AD. 

This contradiction suggests that there's a mistake in my interpretation. Let me reconsider. 

Wait, maybe the angle AFD is not the straight angle because it's not the angle between FA and FD, but between other lines? No, the notation is explicit. 

Wait, maybe the angle is measured in a different way, like reflex angle? For example, if the angle is greater than 180 degrees. But usually, in geometry problems, angles are considered as the smallest possible unless specified otherwise. 

However, if we allow reflex angles, then angle AFD could be 360 - 180 = 180, which is the same as before. 

This suggests that there's no way around it: angle AFD is 180 degrees, leading to y = 190/12. 

But this value of y is not an integer, and the answer
