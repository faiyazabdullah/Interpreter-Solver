MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given information and figure out how the different predicates relate to each other. 

So, the problem states that ABCD is a parallelogram. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are parallel and equal in length, and opposite angles are equal. Also, consecutive angles are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. That seems important here.

Next, it says that the measure of angle ADC is 65 degrees. Let me note that down. Then, there's an angle at DAB labeled as x. Wait, the question asks for x, so we need to find its value. But there's also another predicate saying that the sum of angle ADC (which is 65) and angle DAB (x) equals 180 degrees. So, adding those two gives 180. Therefore, if angle ADC is 65, then x should be 180 minus 65, which would be 115. But wait, that directly gives x = 115. However, the answer choices include 115 as option D. But maybe there's more to it?

Wait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the angles correctly. In a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So, angle ADC and angle DAB are consecutive angles? Let me visualize the parallelogram ABCD. Let me recall that in a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. For example, angle A and angle D are consecutive. Wait, but the way the angles are named here—angle ADC is at vertex D, between points A, D, C. And angle DAB is at vertex A, between points D, A, B. So, these two angles are actually adjacent angles in the parallelogram. Because in a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. So, angle ADC and angle DAB are adjacent, hence their measures should add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, since angle ADC is 65°, then angle DAB (which is x) would indeed be 180° - 65° = 115°, making x = 115. 

But why does the problem mention AB || DC? Well, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are parallel by definition. Since AB is one side and DC is the opposite side, they are already parallel. So that condition is redundant because it's implied by the fact that ABCD is a parallelogram. But maybe the problem is testing understanding that even if we're told AB is parallel to DC, which is part of the parallelogram's properties, we can use that to confirm the angle relations. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's confusion about which angles are being referred to. Let me double-check. Angle ADC is at point D, formed by points A-D-C. So that's angle at D between AD and DC. Angle DAB is at point A, between D-A-B. So, those are adjacent angles. In a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. Therefore, yes, angle ADC + angle DAB = 180°, which gives x = 115°. 

Therefore, according to the given predicates, the answer should be D. However, looking back, the problem says "find x" given that AB is parallel to DC. But since AB || DC is already part of the parallelogram definition, maybe the problem is just reinforcing that property. 

Another thought: could there be an error in assuming that angle ADC and angle DAB are consecutive? Let me sketch mentally. In a parallelogram ABCD, the vertices are ordered such that AB is adjacent to BC, CD, and DA. So, the order is A connected to B and D; B connected to C; C connected to D; D connected to A. So, angle at D (ADC) is between AD and DC. The angle at A (DAB) is between DA and AB. These two angles are adjacent, sharing the side AD. Hence, they are consecutive angles, thus supplementary. 

So, the calculation holds. Given angle ADC is 65°, then x = 180° - 65° = 115°, which is option D. Therefore, the answer should be D. 

But wait, the problem includes the predicate that Equals(Add(MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,C)), MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,B))), 180). Which directly tells us that angle ADC plus angle DAB equals 180°, so again confirming that x is 115. So regardless of the other information, this equation gives x = 115. 

Thus, the correct answer is D.
