MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have a rhombus ABCD, and the measure of angle ABC is 70 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle 1. Hmm, first, I should recall the properties of a rhombus. 

A rhombus is a type of parallelogram where all sides are equal in length. That means opposite sides are parallel, and opposite angles are equal. Also, the consecutive angles in a parallelogram are supplementary, right? So, if one angle is 70 degrees, the adjacent angle should be 180 - 70 = 110 degrees. Wait, but angle ABC is given as 70. Let me visualize the rhombus. Let me label the vertices in order: A, B, C, D. So, ABCD is a rhombus, so AB is parallel to CD, BC is parallel to AD. 

In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. But wait, do they also bisect each other at right angles? Yes, the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other. But how does that relate to the angles here?

But the question mentions angle 1. Wait, the original problem didn't provide a diagram, so angle 1 is probably referring to some specific angle formed by the intersection of diagonals or maybe another angle in the figure. Since the user mentioned "m∠1", it's likely that angle 1 is one of the angles formed by the diagonals intersecting. 

Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the vertex angles. So, if angle ABC is 70 degrees, then diagonal BD would split angle ABC into two equal parts. Let me think. Let me draw this mentally. Suppose ABCD is a rhombus with AB parallel to CD and BC parallel to AD. Angle at B is 70 degrees. Then, diagonal AC and BD intersect at point O. 

If angle ABC is 70 degrees, then the diagonal BD splits angle B into two equal angles. So, each of those angles would be half of 70, which is 35 degrees. Similarly, the other diagonal AC would split the adjacent angle at A. But wait, angle at A would be supplementary to angle B since consecutive angles in a parallelogram are supplementary. So, angle at A would be 180 - 70 = 110 degrees. Therefore, the diagonal AC would split angle A into two angles of 55 degrees each. 

Now, angle 1—assuming it refers to one of these angles formed by the diagonals. For example, if angle 1 is one of the angles created by the intersection of the diagonals. Let me consider the intersection point of diagonals. In a rhombus, diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, they bisect each other and are perpendicular. So, the diagonals intersect at 90 degrees. 

So, if angle 1 is one of the angles formed at the intersection of the diagonals. Wait, but the diagonals divide the rhombus into four right triangles. Each of those triangles has angles that depend on the original angles of the rhombus. Alternatively, perhaps angle 1 is referring to an angle formed by a side and a diagonal. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is one of the angles formed when a diagonal splits angle B. For instance, if diagonal BD splits angle B into two angles of 35 degrees each. So, if angle 1 is one of those angles, then it would be 35 degrees. But 35 isn't among the answer choices. The options are 45, 55, 70, 125. So that can't be. 

Wait, maybe angle 1 is referring to an angle outside the rhombus? Or perhaps it's referring to an angle formed by the diagonals. Let me think again. When diagonals intersect, they form vertical angles. Let me calculate the measures of those angles. 

Since the diagonals are perpendicular, each of the angles at the intersection is 90 degrees. But that doesn't fit either. Wait, no, the diagonals are perpendicular, so the angles between them are 90 degrees, but maybe angle 1 is referring to something else. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is referring to an angle formed by one of the diagonals and a side. For example, in triangle ABC, if we draw diagonal AC, splitting angle B. Wait, but earlier calculation shows that angle ABC is 70 degrees, split into two angles of 35 degrees by diagonal BD. Maybe angle 1 is part of triangle ABD or something like that. 

Alternatively, perhaps angle 1 is referring to the angle between a diagonal and a side. For example, if we take diagonal AC, which connects A to C. Then, in triangle ABC, angle at B is 70 degrees, and the diagonal AC divides it into two angles. Wait, no, because in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. So, diagonal BD splits angle B into two equal parts. 

Let me try to think differently. Let's consider the sum of angles in a rhombus. All sides are equal, opposite angles are equal, consecutive angles are supplementary. So, angles at A and C are equal, angles at B and D are equal. Given angle ABC is 70 degrees, so angle ADC is also 70 degrees, and angles at A and C are 110 degrees each. 

Now, if we look at triangle ABC. Wait, in a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, AB=BC=CD=DA. So, triangle ABC is actually an isoceles triangle? No, because in a rhombus, adjacent angles are supplementary. Wait, but triangle ABC is not necessarily isoceles unless specific conditions are met. Wait, but AB equals BC? Because all sides are equal. Wait, AB and BC are adjacent sides of the rhombus. Since all sides are equal, AB=BC=CD=DA. So, triangle ABC is an equilateral triangle? No, because the angles aren't necessarily 60 degrees. Wait, angle at B is 70 degrees. So, triangle ABC has sides AB, BC, and AC. Since AB=BC, triangle ABC is isoceles with AB=BC. Therefore, the base angles at A and C are equal. Wait, but angle at B is 70 degrees. So, the sum of angles in triangle ABC is 180 degrees. Therefore, angles at A and C are (180 - 70)/2 = 55 degrees each. 

Therefore, angle BAC is 55 degrees. Wait, angle BAC is part of angle BAD, which is 110 degrees. So, if angle BAC is 55 degrees, then angle CAD would be 110 - 55 = 55 degrees? Wait, no. Wait, angle BAD is 110 degrees, and diagonal AC splits it into two angles. Wait, but earlier, we said that the diagonals bisect the angles. So, angle BAD is 110 degrees, so diagonal AC splits it into two angles of 55 degrees each. So, angle BAC and angle CAD are both 55 degrees. 

Similarly, diagonal BD splits angle ABC (which is 70 degrees) into two angles of 35 degrees each. So, angle ABD and angle CBD are 35 degrees each. 

Now, if angle 1 refers to one of these angles. For example, angle ABD is 35 degrees, but that's not in the options. Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is referring to an angle formed by the diagonals. For example, at the intersection point of diagonals, say O. The diagonals intersect at O, forming four right angles? Wait, no. Diagonals in a rhombus are perpendicular, so the angles between them are 90 degrees. But then, each of the four angles at the center is 90 degrees. 

Wait, but maybe angle 1 is referring to an angle formed by the diagonals and a side. For instance, in triangle AOB, where O is the intersection of diagonals. In that case, triangle AOB is a right triangle, since diagonals are perpendicular. So, angle AOB is 90 degrees. But angle 1 could be one of the acute angles in that triangle. 

For example, angle OAB. Let me compute that. In triangle AOB, we have OA and OB as halves of the diagonals. The length of the diagonals depends on the angles of the rhombus. Let me recall that in a rhombus, the diagonals satisfy the relationship: d1 = 2a*sin(theta), d2 = 2a*cos(theta), where theta is one of the angles. Wait, maybe not exactly, but the ratio between the diagonals relates to the angles. 

Alternatively, using trigonometry. Let me consider the diagonals. Let me denote the rhombus ABCD with side length 's'. The diagonals are AC and BD. The diagonals intersect at O. Then, AO = AC/2, BO = BD/2. In triangle ABO, angle at B is 35 degrees (since BD splits angle ABC into two 35-degree angles). So, in triangle ABO, angle at B is 35 degrees, angle at O is 90 degrees. Therefore, the third angle at A (angle OAB) is 180 - 35 - 90 = 55 degrees. So, angle OAB is 55 degrees. 

If angle 1 refers to angle OAB, then the measure is 55 degrees. Which is option B. 

Alternatively, if angle 1 refers to angle AOB, which is 90 degrees, but that's not in the options. Or maybe angle AOD, same thing. 

Another possibility: angle 1 could be referring to an angle formed by a diagonal and a side. For example, angle between AB and BD. Wait, angle ABD is 35 degrees, which is not in the options. 

Wait, but in the previous step, we found that angle OAB is 55 degrees. And 55 is one of the answer choices (option B). So, if angle 1 is angle OAB, then the answer is B. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 refers to angle BAC, which we determined earlier was 55 degrees. That would make sense. Because angle BAC is part of triangle ABC, which is 55 degrees. So, angle BAC is 55 degrees, which would be angle 1. Hence, answer B. 

So putting it all together, the measure of angle 1 is 55 degrees, so the correct answer is B.
