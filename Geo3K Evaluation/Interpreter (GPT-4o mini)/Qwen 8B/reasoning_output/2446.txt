Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the points and segments mentioned.

We have points A, B, C, R, S, T, M. There's a triangle ABC. Then there are several segments: AR, BS, CT, RM, MS, MT, RT. Also, some length equalities and congruences. 

Let me note down the given information:

1. Triangle ABC exists with points A, B, C.
2. Segments: 
   - AR connects A to R.
   - BS connects B to S.
   - CT connects C to T.
   - RM connects R to M.
   - MS connects M to S.
   - MT connects M to T.
   - RT connects R to T.
3. Lengths:
   - Length of RM is 4 units.
   - Length of CT is 7 units.
4. Congruences:
   - Segment AR ≅ SM (since Congruent(Segment(A,R), Segment(S,M))).
   - Segment SB ≅ AM (Congruent(Segment(S,B), Segment(A,M))).
   - Segment CR ≅ RM (Congruent(Segment(C,R), Segment(R,M))).
   - Segment CT ≅ TM (Congruent(Segment(C,T), Segment(T,M))).
   - Segment TM ≅ TB (Congruent(Segment(T,M), Segment(T,B))).

The question asks for MB, given that MC = 7, RM = 4, and AT = 16. Wait, but wait—MC is part of segment CT? Since CT is connected to point C and T, so CT has length 7. And since CT ≅ TM (from the congruence), then TM is also 7. But then TM ≅ TB, so TB is also 7. Hmm, maybe?

Wait, let me re-express all these congruences:

From the congruences:

- CR ≅ RM → So CR = RM = 4 (since RM is given as 4). Therefore, CR = 4.

Then, CT ≅ TM → CT is 7, so TM is also 7. Then TM ≅ TB, so TB = TM = 7. Therefore, TB = 7. So TB is 7. But the question mentions MC = 7. Wait, MC would be part of CT? Because CT connects C to T. So if CT is 7, then MC could be... Wait, maybe I'm mixing up points here.

Wait, the points involved in CT are C and T. So CT is a segment from C to T. The length of CT is given as 7. Also, CT ≅ TM, so TM is 7. Then TM ≅ TB, so TB is 7. So TB = 7. But the question says MC = 7. Wait, where does MC come into play? Maybe MC is another segment. Let me check.

Looking at the segments: We have points M connected to R, S, T. So M is connected to R (RM), M to S (MS), M to T (MT). Also, there's a segment CT connecting C to T, and a segment AR connecting A to R.

So, perhaps MC is another segment? Wait, point M is connected to T, so MT is 7. But MC isn't directly mentioned yet. However, maybe we can find relations involving MC through triangles or other congruences.

Also, given that AT = 16. So AT is a segment from A to T. How is T connected? T is connected to C via CT, and to M via MT. Also, RT connects R to T. So maybe triangle ART or something else involves AT.

Now, the goal is to find MB. So MB is the segment from M to B. Let's think about how to connect this.

First, let's note all the congruences again:

1. AR ≅ SM → So length of AR equals length of SM.
2. SB ≅ AM → Length of SB equals length of AM.
3. CR ≅ RM → So CR = RM = 4.
4. CT ≅ TM → CT = TM = 7.
5. TM ≅ TB → So TB = TM = 7.

Therefore, from CT=7, TM=7, TB=7. So TB=7. Now, the question states that MC=7. Wait, but earlier, CT is 7, which connects C to T. Is MC another segment? Let me see. Points M and C are connected? Not directly stated. Unless there's a segment CM? Or maybe MC is part of another structure.

Alternatively, maybe MC refers to the length from M to C. But how can we find that? Let me think. If we can find coordinates for the points, maybe?

Alternatively, considering triangles and congruencies. Let's consider the congruences and see if we can form triangles.

Starting with the congruences:

Since CR ≅ RM (both 4 units), then triangle CRM is isoceles with CR=RM. So triangle CRM has sides CR=RM=4, and base CM. Wait, but we don't know CM yet. However, the question says MC = 7. Wait, but if MC is the same as CM, then CM = 7. So that gives us the length of CM as 7. So in triangle CRM, sides CR=RM=4, and CM=7. Wait, but in a triangle, the sum of two sides must be greater than the third side. Here, 4 + 4 = 8 > 7, so it's okay. So triangle CRM has sides 4,4,7. So maybe we can use the Law of Cosines here?

But maybe there's another way. Let's hold onto that thought.

Next, looking at the congruence CT ≅ TM. Since CT=7, then TM=7. Also, TM ≅ TB, so TB=7. So TB=7. That tells us that TB is 7. So from point T to B is 7 units.

Now, looking at the congruence SB ≅ AM. So SB equals AM. Also, AR ≅ SM. So SM equals AR. Let me note that.

Let me try to visualize the diagram. It's a bit complex, but perhaps breaking it down:

- Point A connected to R (AR).
- Point B connected to S (BS).
- Point C connected to T (CT).
- Point R connected to M (RM).
- Point M connected to S (MS) and to T (MT).
- Point R connected to T (RT).

Additionally, the triangle ABC. So points A, B, C forming a triangle.

Now, since there are several congruent segments, perhaps certain triangles are congruent or similar.

For example, since AR ≅ SM and SB ≅ AM, maybe triangle ARM is congruent to triangle SMM? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe triangle ARS and others?

Alternatively, since AR ≅ SM and SB ≅ AM, perhaps there's some relationship between triangles ASM and something else.

Alternatively, let's look at triangle ARM and triangle SMM? Not sure. Maybe better to assign variables and set equations.

Let me denote some variables:

Let’s assume that:

- Let x be the length of AR and SM (since they are congruent).
- Let y be the length of SB and AM (since they are congruent).
- From CR ≅ RM, since RM is 4, then CR is 4. So CR = 4.
- CT = 7, so TM = 7, hence TB = 7.

Given that, let's try to find relations.

First, looking at segment CT, which is 7, and TM is 7. So point T is such that CT=7 and TM=7. So T lies somewhere such that moving from C to T is 7 units, and from T to M is also 7 units. So T is a midpoint? No, because unless CM is 14, but the question says MC = 7. Wait, the question says M C = 7, which is CM = 7. Wait, but earlier we had CT = 7 and TM = 7, so CT + TM would be CT + TM = 7 + 7 = 14, which would make CM = CT + TM = 14? But the question says MC = 7. That seems conflicting. Wait, this suggests that my assumption may be wrong.

Wait, hold on! If CT is 7, and TM is 7, then depending on the position of T relative to C and M, CM could be CT ± TM. For instance, if T is between C and M, then CM = CT + TM = 7+7=14. But the question says MC = 7. Which implies that either my understanding is wrong, or there's a different configuration.

Wait, this contradiction suggests that my previous conclusion that TM = CT is incorrect. Wait, no—the congruence says Segment CT ≅ Segment TM. So CT and TM are congruent, so their lengths are equal. Hence CT = TM = 7. Therefore, if T is between C and M, then CM = CT + TM = 14. But the question says MC = 7. So this contradicts. Therefore, my assumption that T is between C and M must be wrong. Instead, perhaps T is not on CM, but elsewhere.

Wait, but how can CT and TM be congruent without being colinear? For example, if T is such that CT and TM are sides of a triangle. So triangle CTT? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, T is connected to C and to M. So points C, T, M form a triangle, with CT = TM = 7. So triangle CMT has CT = TM = 7. Therefore, triangle CMT is isoceles with CT = TM. Thus, the base is CM, and legs CT and TM. But the question says MC = 7, which would be the base. So CM = 7. Therefore, in triangle CMT, sides CT = TM = 7, and base CM = 7. Therefore, triangle CMT is equilateral? Wait, no—if all three sides are equal, then yes. But CT and TM are 7, and CM is 7. Therefore, triangle CMT is equilateral with all sides 7. So each angle is 60 degrees. Interesting.

But then, how does that fit with the rest of the diagram? Let me note that.

So, if triangle CMT is equilateral, then angle at T is 60 degrees. Also, since CT = TM = 7, and CM = 7, that's consistent with the given MC = 7. So that resolves that conflict.

So now, knowing that, let's proceed.

Now, looking at other parts. Let's consider the other congruences.

We have CR ≅ RM, so CR = RM = 4. So CR is 4, RM is 4. So triangle CRM has sides CR = RM = 4, and CM = 7. As before, which forms an isoceles triangle with sides 4,4,7.

So, in triangle CRM, we can compute angles using the Law of Cosines.

Law of Cosines: For triangle CRM,

CM² = CR² + RM² - 2 * CR * RM * cos(angle at R)

So 7² = 4² + 4² - 2*4*4*cos(theta), where theta is angle at R.

Calculating:

49 = 16 + 16 - 32 cos(theta)

49 = 32 - 32 cos(theta)

Subtract 32 from both sides:

17 = -32 cos(theta)

cos(theta) = -17/32 ≈ -0.53125

Thus, angle at R is arccos(-17/32) ≈ 122.3 degrees. Not sure if needed yet, but just noting.

Now, moving on. Let's think about other congruences.

We have AR ≅ SM. So length of AR equals length of SM. Let's call this length x. Similarly, SB ≅ AM, so length of SB equals length of AM; let's call this length y.

So AR = SM = x, SB = AM = y.

Now, let's see if we can relate these to other parts.

Looking at the points:

Point M is connected to R, S, and T. So M is connected to R (RM), to S (MS), and to T (MT). Also, R is connected to A and T. S is connected to B and M. T is connected to C and M.

So, perhaps there are triangles involving M and other points.

For example, triangle RMS: points R, M, S. Since RM = 4, MS = x, and RS? Not sure.

Alternatively, triangle ARM: points A, R, M. Since AR = x, RM = 4, and AM = y. Wait, because AM is congruent to SB (which is y). So in triangle ARM, sides AR = x, RM = 4, and AM = y. But we don't know x or y yet.

Similarly, triangle SMB: points S, M, B. SM = x, MB is what we're trying to find, and SB = y. So in triangle SMB, sides SM = x, SB = y, and MB (unknown). But we don't know the relation between them yet.

Hmm. Also, since SB = AM = y, and AM is a segment from A to M. Perhaps there's a way to express AM in terms of other segments?

Alternatively, perhaps using coordinates. Assign coordinates to points and calculate.

Let me try coordinate geometry. Let's place some points to simplify calculations.

Let me choose coordinate system:

Let me place point M at origin (0, 0) for simplicity.

Since RM = 4, and point R is connected to M. Let me assume that point R is along the x-axis for simplicity. So let’s say R is at (-a, 0), so that distance from M (0,0) to R is a, which should be 4. So a = 4. Therefore, R is at (-4, 0).

Now, since SM is congruent to AR (AR = SM = x). Let me first find coordinates for S and A.

But I need more info. Let's think about other points.

Point T is connected to M and C. Earlier, we determined that CT = TM = 7, and CM = 7. So triangle CMT is equilateral. Given that, if I can find coordinates for C and T, that might help.

But since M is at (0,0), and T is connected to M (distance 7). Let me place T somewhere. Let me suppose that T is located at (7, 0), making MT = 7. Wait, but then if T is at (7,0), and M is at (0,0), then CT = 7. So point C would be located such that the distance from C to T is 7. Since triangle CMT is equilateral, then point C would be at (3.5, (7√3)/2) or something like that. But this might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe aligning points differently.

Alternatively, since triangle CMT is equilateral with sides 7, then coordinates can be chosen accordingly. Let me try to fix coordinates for C and T.

Assume M is at (0,0). Let me place T at (7, 0), so MT = 7. Then, since triangle CMT is equilateral, point C would be located at (3.5, (7√3)/2) or (3.5, -(7√3)/2). Let me pick the upper half-plane for simplicity: C is at (3.5, (7√3)/2). Then CT is from C to T (7,0), which has length 7, and CM is from C to M (0,0), which should be 7. Let me verify the distance between C (3.5, (7√3)/2) and M (0,0):

Distance squared is (3.5)^2 + [(7√3)/2]^2 = (12.25) + (49 * 3)/4 = 12.25 + 36.75 = 49. Yes, sqrt(49)=7. Correct. So that works.

So coordinates:

M: (0, 0)

T: (7, 0)

C: (3.5, (7√3)/2 )

Now, we need to find coordinates for other points: A, B, R, S.

We already placed R at (-4, 0), assuming RM = 4. Wait, earlier I considered R at (-4, 0), but that depends on the coordinate system. Let me confirm.

Yes, if M is at (0,0), and RM = 4, then R is at (-4, 0), assuming straight line along x-axis.

Now, we need to handle the congruences:

AR ≅ SM. So AR = SM. Let's find coordinates for A and S.

Also, SB ≅ AM. So SB = AM.

Let me think about point A. Since there's a segment AR connecting A to R (-4, 0). Also, there's a triangle ABC. So A, B, C are vertices of triangle ABC.

Let me attempt to find coordinates for A and S.

First, let's work on SM. SM is the segment from S to M (0,0). Its length is equal to AR.

So if I can find coordinates for S and A such that SM = AR.

But I need more constraints. Let me think.

Also, there's a segment BS connecting B to S. And SB ≅ AM. So SB = AM. So if I can find AM, which is the distance from A to M (0,0).

Let me denote coordinates:

Let me assume that point S has coordinates (x_s, y_s). Then SM is the distance from S to M (0,0): sqrt(x_s^2 + y_s^2) = |SM| = AR.

Point A is connected to R (-4, 0), so AR is the distance from A to R: sqrt[(Ax +4)^2 + (Ay - 0)^2] = AR.

Therefore, sqrt[(Ax +4)^2 + Ay^2] = sqrt(x_s^2 + y_s^2). Squaring both sides: (Ax +4)^2 + Ay^2 = x_s^2 + y_s^2.

But I don't know Ax and Ay yet. This seems too many variables. Maybe there's another way.

Alternatively, since there are congruences between segments, perhaps we can find relations between triangles.

Another idea: Since AR ≅ SM and SB ≅ AM, maybe triangles ARM and SMM? Not sure. Wait, if we consider triangle ARM and triangle SMM? Not sure. Let me think.

Alternatively, since SB = AM, and AM is the distance from A to M, while SB is the distance from S to B. If we can express AM and SB in terms of other variables.

Alternatively, maybe considering vectors or coordinate geometry.

Alternatively, since we have coordinates for M, T, C, R, maybe we can find coordinates for A and B.

Let me think about point A. Since AR is connected to R (-4,0), and there's a triangle ABC. Also, there's a segment CT which we've already placed.

Alternatively, perhaps focusing on point A and its connections.

But maybe it's getting too complicated. Let me think if there are other congruences or properties.

Earlier, we found that TB = 7. Since TB is the segment from T (7,0) to B. So TB = 7. So point B lies somewhere at distance 7 from T (7,0). So coordinates of B satisfy (xB - 7)^2 + (yB)^2 = 7^2.

Also, since there's a segment BS connecting B to S. And SB = AM. So AM is the distance from A to M (0,0). So if we can find AM, that equals SB.

But I still need relations for A and S.

Alternatively, since there's a triangle ABC, which includes point A, B, C. We have coordinates for C (3.5, (7√3)/2 ). So if I can find coordinates for A and B such that ABC is a triangle.

This seems complex, but maybe manageable.

Let me think of another approach. Since the question gives AT = 16. So the segment from A to T (7,0) has length 16. So if I can write the distance between A and T as 16.

Let me denote coordinates for A as (Ax, Ay). Then distance from A to T (7,0) is sqrt[(Ax - 7)^2 + (Ay - 0)^2] = 16. Squared: (Ax - 7)^2 + Ay^2 = 256.

Also, distance from A to R (-4,0) is AR. Which equals SM. And SM is the distance from S to M (0,0), which is sqrt(x_S^2 + y_S^2).

But I don't know S's coordinates yet.

But perhaps there's a relation between A and S through the congruence AR ≅ SM. So if I can find expressions for AR and SM.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to link AM and SB.

Since SB = AM. Let me write that.

AM is the distance from A to M (0,0): sqrt(Ax^2 + Ay^2).

SB is the distance from S to B: sqrt((xB - xS)^2 + (yB - yS)^2).

So sqrt(Ax^2 + Ay^2) = sqrt((xB - xS)^2 + (yB - yS)^2). Squaring both sides: Ax^2 + Ay^2 = (xB - xS)^2 + (yB - yS)^2.

But again, too many variables.

Alternatively, since we have coordinates for C, T, M, and R, maybe we can find relations involving other points.

Wait, what about the segment RT? R is at (-4, 0), T is at (7, 0). So RT is the segment from (-4,0) to (7,0), which is horizontal line. Length RT is 7 - (-4) = 11 units. Wait, but is there any information about RT? No, except that it's a segment. Not sure if helpful.

But the question gives AT = 16. So A is a point such that distance from A to T (7,0) is 16. So A lies on a circle centered at T with radius 16.

Also, AR is the distance from A to R (-4,0), which is equal to SM.

Moreover, there's a segment BS connecting B to S, and SB = AM.

This seems very interconnected, but perhaps with enough equations, we can solve.

But this might take time. Let me see if I can find another relation.

Recall that we have CR ≅ RM, which is 4. Point C is at (3.5, (7√3)/2 ), and point R is at (-4, 0). So CR is the distance between C and R. Let me calculate that to confirm it's 4.

Coordinates of C: (3.5, (7√3)/2 ) ≈ (3.5, 6.062)

Coordinates of R: (-4, 0)

Distance CR: sqrt[(3.5 - (-4))^2 + ((7√3)/2 - 0)^2]

Calculate x difference: 3.5 + 4 = 7.5

y difference: (7√3)/2

So squared distance: (7.5)^2 + [(7√3)/2]^2 = 56.25 + (49 * 3)/4 = 56.25 + 36.75 = 93. So sqrt(93) ≈ 9.643, which is not 4. Wait, this contradicts the earlier statement that CR ≅ RM (which is 4). What did I do wrong here?

Oh no! This indicates an error in my assumption. Earlier, I assumed that CR ≅ RM, so CR = RM = 4. But according to this calculation, CR is sqrt(93) ≈ 9.643, which conflicts with the given CR = 4. So there's a mistake in my setup.

Where did I go wrong? Ah, I think I made a wrong assumption about the placement of points. Specifically, I assumed that T is at (7,0) and M at (0,0), leading to CT = 7, TM = 7, and CM = 7. But this led to CR not being 4. Therefore, my coordinate assignment was flawed.

Let me backtrack. The problem arises because I fixed T at (7,0) and M at (0,0), but this caused CR to not be 4. So my initial assumption about placing T and M might be incorrect. Perhaps I need to adjust the coordinates.

Alternative approach: Let me reconsider the placement of points to satisfy CR = 4 and RM = 4.

Given that RM = 4, and CR = 4. So points R and C are both at distance 4 from M.

Let me place M at (0,0). Let me choose coordinates for R and C such that both are at distance 4 from M. For example, let me place R at (4,0) and C at (0,4). Wait, but then CR would be the distance between (4,0) and (0,4), which is sqrt( (4)^2 + (4)^2 ) = sqrt(32) ≈ 5.656, not 4. So that doesn't work.

Alternatively, to have CR = 4 and RM = 4, points R and C must be at distance 4 from M, and also distance 4 apart from each other.

So, if M is at (0,0), then R and C are points on a circle of radius 4 around M, and the distance between R and C is also 4.

So, for example, placing R at (4,0) and C at (2, 2√3). Let's check:

Distance from M (0,0) to R (4,0) is 4.

Distance from M (0,0) to C (2, 2√3) is sqrt(2² + (2√3)^2) = sqrt(4 + 12) = sqrt(16) = 4. Good.

Distance between R (4,0) and C (2, 2√3) is sqrt( (4-2)^2 + (0 - 2√3)^2 ) = sqrt(4 + 12) = sqrt(16) = 4. Perfect!

So now, points R (4,0), C (2, 2√3), M (0,0). This satisfies CR = RM = 4.

Great! Now, let's fix these coordinates:

M: (0,0)

R: (4,0)

C: (2, 2√3)

Now, CT = 7. So point T is such that distance from C to T is 7. Also, TM = 7 (from congruence CT ≅ TM), so distance from T to M is 7. So T is a point such that it is 7 units away from both C and M. Let's find coordinates for T.

Points M (0,0) and C (2, 2√3). We need to find T such that distance from T to M is 7 and from T to C is 7. So T lies at the intersection of two circles: one centered at M with radius 7, and one centered at C with radius 7.

Equation of circle around M: x² + y² = 49.

Equation of circle around C: (x - 2)^2 + (y - 2√3)^2 = 49.

Subtracting the first equation from the second:

(x - 2)^2 + (y - 2√3)^2 - (x² + y²) = 0

Expand:

x² -4x +4 + y² - 4√3 y + 12 - x² - y² = 0

Simplify:

-4x +4 -4√3 y +12 = 0 → -4x -4√3 y + 16 = 0 → Divide by -4: x + √3 y - 4 = 0 → x = 4 - √3 y.

So the line of intersection is x = 4 - √3 y.

Substitute back into x² + y² = 49:

(4 - √3 y)^2 + y² = 49

Expand: 16 - 8√3 y + 3y² + y² = 49 → 16 - 8√3 y + 4y² = 49 → 4y² - 8√3 y + 16 - 49 = 0 → 4y² - 8√3 y - 33 = 0.

Divide by 4: y² - 2√3 y - 33/4 = 0.

Using quadratic formula: y = [2√3 ± sqrt( (2√3)^2 + 4*(33/4) )]/2

Calculate discriminant: (12) + 33 = 45.

So y = [2√3 ± sqrt(45)] / 2 = [2√3 ± 3√5]/2.

So two solutions for y. Correspondingly, x = 4 - √3 y.

Let me compute approximate values to get an idea:

sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732, sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236.

So for the positive root:

y = [2*1.732 + 3*2.236]/2 ≈ [3.464 + 6.708]/2 ≈ 10.172/2 ≈ 5.086

x = 4 - 1.732 * 5.086 ≈ 4 - 8.805 ≈ -4.805

Other root:

y = [2*1.732 - 3*2.236]/2 ≈ [3.464 - 6.708]/2 ≈ (-3.244)/2 ≈ -1.622

x = 4 - 1.732*(-1.622) ≈ 4 + 2.806 ≈ 6.806

So two possible points for T: approximately (-4.805, 5.086) and (6.806, -1.622). 

But since the problem didn't specify orientation, we can choose one. Let's pick the second one for simplicity: T ≈ (6.806, -1.622). Let's keep it symbolic.

Let me denote T's coordinates as (x_T, y_T), satisfying x_T = 4 - √3 y_T, and lying on x² + y² = 49.

Now, we also have that TB = 7, since TM ≅ TB. So distance from T to B is 7. So point B lies on a circle centered at T with radius 7.

But we also have the segment BS, which connects B to S, and SB ≅ AM. So SB = AM. 

Additionally, there's the segment AR, which connects A to R (4,0), and AR ≅ SM. So SM = AR.

This is getting complex, but let's try to proceed.

Let me focus on finding coordinates for A and S.

We also know that AT = 16. So distance from A to T is 16. So A lies on a circle centered at T with radius 16.

Let me denote A as (x_A, y_A). So:

(x_A - x_T)^2 + (y_A - y_T)^2 = 16^2 = 256.

Also, AR is the distance from A to R (4,0):

sqrt( (x_A - 4)^2 + (y_A - 0)^2 ) = AR.

Which equals SM, the distance from S to M (0,0):

sqrt( x_S^2 + y_S^2 ) = AR.

So (x_A - 4)^2 + y_A^2 = x_S^2 + y_S^2.

Also, SB = AM. AM is the distance from A to M (0,0):

sqrt(x_A^2 + y_A^2) = SB = distance from S to B.

So sqrt(x_A^2 + y_A^2) = sqrt( (x_B - x_S)^2 + (y_B - y_S)^2 ).

Squaring both sides:

x_A^2 + y_A^2 = (x_B - x_S)^2 + (y_B - y_S)^2.

But this introduces more variables: x_B, y_B, x_S, y_S.

However, there might be other relations.

Also, since there's a triangle ABC, with points A, B, C (2, 2√3). So coordinates of A and B must satisfy the triangle condition, but without more info, it's hard to use.

This seems too many variables. Maybe there's a smarter approach.

Let me recall that the question asks for MB, which is the distance from M (0,0) to B. So if I can find coordinates for B, then MB is simply sqrt(x_B^2 + y_B^2).

But how?

We know that TB = 7, so B lies on a circle around T with radius 7. Let me denote T as (x_T, y_T). So B lies on x_T^2 + y_T^2 = 49 (wait, no: T is at distance 7 from M, so x_T^2 + y_T^2 = 49. And B is at distance 7 from T, so (x_B - x_T)^2 + (y_B - y_T)^2 = 49.

So combining these, B lies on the intersection of two circles: one centered at T with radius 7, and another... Well, not sure. But if I can find coordinates for B, then MB is the distance from (0,0) to B.

Alternatively, since we need to find MB, and we know TB = 7, and we might relate MB with other distances.

But without knowing where B is, this is challenging.

Wait, but there's also the segment BS, which is congruent to AM. So SB = AM.

Let me think about AM. AM is the distance from A to M (0,0), which is sqrt(x_A^2 + y_A^2). And SB is the distance from S to B, which is sqrt( (x_B - x_S)^2 + (y_B - y_S)^2 ). So if I can relate these.

But I still don't know S's coordinates.

Alternatively, since AR = SM, and AR is the distance from A to R (4,0), and SM is the distance from S to M (0,0). So if I can express SM in terms of AR, and relate it to other parts.

Let me denote AR = SM = k. So:

k = sqrt( (x_A - 4)^2 + y_A^2 ) = sqrt(x_S^2 + y_S^2 )

So, (x_A - 4)^2 + y_A^2 = x_S^2 + y_S^2.

But I don't know x_S and y_S.

However, there's also the segment BS, which is congruent to AM. AM is sqrt(x_A^2 + y_A^2). So SB = sqrt(x_A^2 + y_A^2).

So, if I can find x_S and y_S in terms of other variables...

But this seems stuck. Maybe I need to make assumptions or find relations between A and S.

Alternatively, let me consider that there's a segment MS, which connects M (0,0) to S. And since SM = AR, which is k. So S lies on a circle centered at M with radius k.

But also, there's a segment BS connecting B to S. And SB = AM = sqrt(x_A^2 + y_A^2). So if I can relate AM and k.

But I'm going in circles.

Perhaps I need to find another approach, using the given AT = 16.

Since AT = 16, and T is a point we've defined earlier, let's use that.

Let me recall that T is a point such that distance from T to M is 7, and from T to C is 7. So T is one of the intersection points of the two circles around M and C with radius 7. Let me choose one of the solutions for T.

Earlier, I approximated T as (6.806, -1.622). Let me try to find exact coordinates.

From earlier, we had:

x_T = 4 - √3 y_T

And x_T^2 + y_T^2 = 49.

Substituting x_T = 4 - √3 y_T into x_T^2 + y_T^2 = 49:

(4 - √3 y_T)^2 + y_T^2 = 49

Expanding:

16 - 8√3 y_T + 3y_T^2 + y_T^2 = 49

Combine like terms:

4y_T^2 - 8√3 y_T + 16 - 49 = 0

4y_T^2 - 8√3 y_T - 33 = 0

Dividing by 4:

y_T^2 - 2√3 y_T - 33/4 = 0

Using quadratic formula:

y_T = [2√3 ± sqrt( (2√3)^2 + 4*(33/4) ) ] / 2

Compute discriminant:

(2√3)^2 + 33 = 12 + 33 = 45

So y_T = [2√3 ± √45]/2 = [2√3 ± 3√5]/2

So y_T = √3 + (3√5)/2 or y_T = √3 - (3√5)/2.

Wait, actually, it's [2√3 ± 3√5]/2 = √3 ± (3√5)/2.

Let me take the negative root for simplicity, assuming T is below the x-axis. Let's choose y_T = √3 - (3√5)/2. Let's calculate this numerically:

√3 ≈ 1.732, √5 ≈ 2.236.

So y_T ≈ 1.732 - (3*2.236)/2 ≈ 1.732 - 3.354 ≈ -1.622, which matches the earlier approximation. So x_T = 4 - √3*y_T.

Plugging in y_T ≈ -1.622:

x_T ≈ 4 - √3*(-1.622) ≈ 4 + 1.732*1.622 ≈ 4 + 2.806 ≈ 6.806, as before.

So T is at approximately (6.806, -1.622).

Now, let's use this to find the coordinates of A.

AT = 16, so A is on a circle centered at T with radius 16. Let me write the equation:

(x_A - x_T)^2 + (y_A - y_T)^2 = 16^2 = 256.

Also, AR = SM. Let me denote SM = AR = k.

So k^2 = (x_A - 4)^2 + y_A^2 = x_S^2 + y_S^2.

Also, SB = AM = sqrt(x_A^2 + y_A^2).

But I still don't know S's coordinates. Let me think if there's another constraint.

Since there's a segment BS, and S is connected to M (since SM is a segment). So S is a point such that SM = k, and SB = AM.

Let me assume that S is somewhere on the circle centered at M with radius k. So S lies on x_S^2 + y_S^2 = k^2.

Also, BS = AM = sqrt(x_A^2 + y_A^2). So the distance from B to S is sqrt(x_A^2 + y_A^2).

But B is on the circle around T with radius 7: (x_B - x_T)^2 + (y_B - y_T)^2 = 49.

This is getting too abstract. Maybe I need to assume specific values for k or find relations between k and other quantities.

Let me recall that in the beginning, we have CR = 4, RM = 4, and CM = 7. In our current setup, CM is the distance from C (2, 2√3) to M (0,0), which is sqrt(2^2 + (2√3)^2) = sqrt(4 + 12) = sqrt(16) = 4. Wait, this contradicts the given MC = 7. Oh no! Another contradiction!

Wait, this is critical. Earlier, the problem states that MC = 7, but in this setup, CM is 4. So this indicates another error.

Wait, where did this come from? The problem says MC = 7, but in our setup, with M at (0,0), C at (2, 2√3), CM is 4. This is inconsistent. So my assumption about the placement of C is wrong.

Ah! The problem states that MC = 7. So in our setup, CM must be 7, not 4. This means that my earlier assumption about placing C at (2, 2√3) is incorrect.

Let me revisit the placement of points. We need to ensure that CM = 7, and also CR = 4, RM = 4.

Let me start over.

Let me place M at (0,0).

Let me define R and C such that MR = 4 and MC = 7, and CR = 4.

So, points R and C are at distance 4 from M, and the distance between R and C is 4.

Wait, this is the same as before, but now CM = 7, not 4. Wait, no: CM is the distance from C to M, which is 7. So C is at distance 7 from M, and R is at distance 4 from M, and CR = 4.

So, we have points M, R, C such that:

- Distance from M to R: 4.

- Distance from M to C: 7.

- Distance from R to C: 4.

So, this forms a triangle MRC with sides MR = 4, MC = 7, RC = 4.

Wait, but in a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. Here, MR + RC = 4 + 4 = 8 > 7 (OK), MR + MC = 4 + 7 = 11 > 4 (OK), RC + MC = 4 + 7 = 11 > 4 (OK). So possible.

Let me find coordinates for R and C.

Let me place M at (0,0). Let me place R at (4, 0), so that MR = 4.

Now, point C is at distance 7 from M and at distance 4 from R. So it's the intersection of two circles: one centered at M (0,0) with radius 7, and one centered at R (4,0) with radius 4.

Equations:

Circle around M: x² + y² = 49.

Circle around R: (x - 4)^2 + y^2 = 16.

Subtracting the second equation from the first:

x² + y² - [(x - 4)^2 + y^2] = 49 - 16 → x² - (x^2 - 8x + 16) = 33 → 8x - 16 = 33 → 8x = 49 → x = 49/8 = 6.125.

So x-coordinate of C is 49/8. Now, substitute back into x² + y² = 49 to find y.

x = 49/8, so x² = (49^2)/(8^2) = 2401/64.

So y² = 49 - 2401/64 = (49*64 - 2401)/64.

Calculate 49*64: 3136.

So y² = (3136 - 2401)/64 = 735/64.

Thus, y = ±√(735)/8 = ±(√735)/8. Simplify √735: 735 = 49*15, so √735 = 7√15. So y = ±7√15/8.

So coordinates of C are (49/8, 7√15
