Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points M, L, N, P, and maybe others. Let me start by listing out all the given predicates to make sure I don't miss anything.

First, there are two right angles mentioned: Angle(M,L,P) and Angle(M,N,P). Both measure 90 degrees. That means lines LP and MP are perpendicular, and similarly NP and MP are perpendicular. Wait, so if both LP and NP are perpendicular to MP, then LP and NP must be parallel to each other because they're both perpendicular to the same line MP. But wait, unless they are on different sides of MP. Hmm, but since both angles at M are right angles, that suggests that points L and N are both on the same line? Or maybe forming some sort of shape?

Then there are angles at point M: MeasureOf(Angle(L,M,P)) is 25 degrees and MeasureOf(Angle(N,M,P)) is also 25 degrees. Wait, so those angles are at point M, between points L and P, and between N and P. Since both angles are 25 degrees, maybe points L and N are arranged symmetrically around MP? Because if you have two lines ML and MN making 25-degree angles with MP, but both angles are measured from M to P. Wait, maybe points L and N are on opposite sides of MP? But since both angles are 25 degrees, perhaps forming a sort of 'X' shape with MP as one arm, and L and N on either side?

But then there are these expressions for angles at P: MeasureOf(Angle(L,P,M)) is 3x + 6 and MeasureOf(Angle(N,P,M)) is 4x - 2. Wait, Angle(L,P,M) would be the angle at point P between points L and M. Similarly for Angle(N,P,M). So, those are angles at P involving lines PL and PM, and PN and PM respectively.

Let me try to visualize this. Let me sketch mentally. Point M is connected to L and N such that angles at M between ML and MP, and MN and MP are both 25 degrees. Also, angles at M between ML and MP and MN and MP being 25 degrees implies that ML and MN form angles of 25 degrees with MP. So, if MP is a common side, then ML and MN are two lines from M making 25-degree angles with MP. Therefore, points L and N are on different sides of MP, creating two 25-degree angles. Then, since both angles at M are 25 degrees, and the lines LP and NP are perpendicular to MP (since angles at M-L-P and M-N-P are right angles), that would mean that lines LP and NP are perpendicular to MP, hence LP and NP are both perpendicular to MP, implying that LP and NP are parallel to each other. 

Wait, but if LP and NP are both perpendicular to MP, then lines LP and NP are parallel. However, since points L and N are on different sides of MP, the lines LP and NP would be going in opposite directions. But maybe they form a rectangle or something? Wait, but with points L and N connected to P. Maybe quadrilateral LMPN has some properties?

Alternatively, considering triangle LMP and triangle NMP. Let me think about triangle LMP. In triangle LMP, angle at M is 25 degrees, angle at P is given by 3x+6. Wait, but earlier it was stated that angle at M-L-P is 90 degrees. Wait, hold on. There's confusion here. Let me recheck.

Original given predicates:

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,P)), 90) → So angle at point L? No, angle M-L-P is the angle at point L between points M, L, P? Wait, no. Wait, angle notation: Angle(A,B,C) refers to the angle at point B between points A, B, C. So Angle(M,L,P) is the angle at point L between points M, L, P. Wait, that contradicts previous statements. Wait, no. Wait, the first given is Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,P)), 90). So that's angle at L between M, L, P. Which would be angle ML P. So that's a right angle at L. Similarly, angle at N between M, N, P is 90 degrees. So angle at N between MNP is right. Wait, so points L and N are such that ML is perpendicular to LP, and MN is perpendicular to NP. So that would imply that lines LP and NP are both perpendicular to ML and MN respectively. But how does that fit with the rest?

Wait, maybe I need to consider coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to the points to model this. Let me assume point M is at the origin (0,0). Since angle at L between M, L, P is 90 degrees, that would mean ML is perpendicular to LP. Similarly, MN is perpendicular to NP. Let me try to place point P somewhere. Suppose line MP is along the x-axis. Let me say point M is at (0,0), and point P is at (p,0) for some p. Now, angle at L between M, L, P is 90 degrees. So ML is perpendicular to LP. Let me find coordinates for point L. Let me suppose that point L is somewhere such that ML is perpendicular to LP. Similarly for point N.

But since angle at M between L and P is 25 degrees. Wait, original given: MeasureOf(Angle(L,M,P)) is 25 degrees. Wait, Angle(L,M,P) is the angle at M between points L, M, P. So that's the angle at M between ML and MP. So angle at M between ML and MP is 25 degrees. Similarly, angle at M between MN and MP is also 25 degrees. So that suggests that ML and MN are both making 25-degree angles with MP. So if MP is along the x-axis from M(0,0) to P(p,0), then ML and MN are lines from M(0,0) making 25 degrees above and below the x-axis? Wait, but if both angles at M are 25 degrees, then ML and MN could be on the same side? But then the angles would add up. Wait, but if both angles at M are 25 degrees, then the total angle between ML and MN would be 50 degrees. But since both angles are measured from ML and MN to MP, which is along the x-axis. So if ML is making 25 degrees above MP (the x-axis), and MN is making 25 degrees below MP, then ML and MN would be symmetric with respect to MP. Alternatively, both could be on the same side, but then the angle between them would be zero, which doesn't make sense. So more likely, ML and MN are on opposite sides of MP, each making 25 degrees with MP.

So if MP is along the positive x-axis from M(0,0) to P(p,0), then ML would be a line from M(0,0) at 25 degrees above the x-axis, and MN would be a line from M(0,0) at 25 degrees below the x-axis. Then, point L lies along the line ML, and point N lies along the line MN.

Now, since angle at L between M, L, P is 90 degrees. So angle ML P is 90 degrees. Let me check that. For point L on ML, line LP should be perpendicular to ML. Since ML is at 25 degrees above the x-axis, then line LP should be perpendicular to ML. So the slope of ML is tan(25°), so the slope of LP, being perpendicular, would be -cot(25°). Let me compute that. But maybe instead of slopes, think geometrically. If ML is at 25 degrees, then LP is perpendicular to ML, which would make angle between ML and LP 90 degrees. So point P lies somewhere along the line that is perpendicular to ML at point L. Similarly for point N.

But maybe this coordinate system approach is getting too complicated. Let me think about triangles. Since angle at L is 90 degrees (from Angle(M,L,P)=90), and angle at M is 25 degrees, then in triangle MLP, we have angle at M = 25°, angle at L = 90°, so the remaining angle at P would be 180 - 25 - 90 = 65 degrees. Similarly, in triangle NMP, angle at M is 25°, angle at N is 90°, so angle at P would be 65° as well.

Wait, but according to the given predicates, MeasureOf(Angle(L,P,M)) is 3x + 6. That angle is at P between points L, P, M. So that's the angle at P in triangle MLP, which we just said is 65 degrees. So 3x + 6 = 65. Solving for x: 3x = 65 - 6 = 59 → x = 59 / 3 ≈ 19.666... But then the other angle at P in triangle NMP, MeasureOf(Angle(N,P,M)) is 4x - 2. Similarly, that angle would be 65 degrees as well. So setting 4x - 2 = 65 → 4x = 67 → x = 67/4 = 16.75. But that gives conflicting values for x. Contradiction! So my assumption must be wrong.

Hmm, where did I go wrong? Let me re-examine. The angle at P in triangle MLP is supposed to be 65 degrees. But according to the given, it's 3x + 6. And angle at P in triangle NMP is 4x - 2. If both are 65 degrees, then equating them would give 3x +6 = 4x -2 → x=8. But then substituting back, 3*8 +6 = 30, and 4*8 -2=30. Oh! Wait, so maybe I made a mistake in assuming that both angles at P are 65 degrees. Let me check again.

In triangle MLP, angles are at M: 25°, at L: 90°, so angle at P is 180 -25 -90 = 65°. Similarly, in triangle NMP, angle at M: 25°, angle at N: 90°, so angle at P is also 65°. Therefore, both angles at P (in triangles MLP and NMP) are 65°, which equals both 3x +6 and 4x -2. So setting them equal:

3x +6 = 4x -2  
Subtract 3x from both sides: 6 = x -2  
Add 2: x = 8  

Therefore, x is 8. But the question asks for "Find P N." Wait, the question says "Find P N." Wait, that's unclear. Wait, looking back at the problem statement: the question is "Find P N." But the answer choices are numerical. Wait, maybe it's a typo and meant to ask for x? Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem. Wait, the user wrote:

"QUESTION: Find P N."

But the answer choices are A. 25, B. 30, C. 50, D. 60. So maybe "PN" refers to the measure of angle at P between N and M? Wait, but the measures of angles at P are already given as 3x +6 and 4x -2, which we found x=8, leading to 3*8+6=30 and 4*8-2=30. So both angles at P are 30 degrees. Wait, but earlier calculation said angle at P in triangle MLP was 65 degrees. What's happening here?

Ah, here's the mistake. Earlier, I thought angle at P in triangle MLP is 65 degrees, but that's incorrect. Because the angle at P in triangle MLP is actually the angle at P between points L, P, M, which is Angle(L,P,M). But earlier, I assumed that triangle MLP has angles at M (25°), at L (90°), and at P. But that's only true if the triangle is formed by points M, L, P. However, the fact that angle at L is 90 degrees (angle M-L-P) is part of the triangle MLP. So yes, in triangle MLP, angle at L is 90°, angle at M is 25°, so angle at P is 65°, which is Angle(L,P,M). But according to the given, MeasureOf(Angle(L,P,M)) is 3x +6. So that would mean 3x +6 = 65, giving x=(65-6)/3=59/3≈19.666..., but then the other angle at P (MeasureOf(Angle(N,P,M))) is 4x-2. If that angle were also part of triangle NMP, then similarly it would be 65°, leading to equation 4x-2=65→x=67/4=16.75. These two equations contradict each other. Hence, there's a contradiction. This indicates that my initial assumption about the angles in the triangles is wrong.

Where is the error? Let me re-examine the setup. The given states that angle at M-L-P is 90°, which is angle at L between M, L, P. So that's not the angle inside triangle MLP; rather, it's a right angle at L, which would make triangle MLP a right triangle with right angle at L. So in triangle MLP, angle at L is 90°, angle at M is 25°, so angle at P is 65°, as before. Therefore, MeasureOf(Angle(L,P,M)) is 65°, which is set equal to 3x +6. Similarly, for triangle NMP, angle at N is 90°, angle at M is 25°, so angle at P is 65°, which is MeasureOf(Angle(N,P,M)) = 4x - 2. Setting both equal to 65° gives 3x +6=65 and 4x-2=65, which leads to x=59/3 and x=67/4, which are inconsistent. Therefore, there's an inconsistency here, suggesting that my interpretation is wrong.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the angles at P are not the third angles of the triangles, but something else. Let me think again. The angle at P in triangle MLP is Angle(L,P,M), which is the angle between PL and PM. But if triangle MLP has a right angle at L, then the sum of angles is 180. So angle at M (25°) + angle at L (90°) + angle at P = 180. So angle at P is 65°, which is indeed the case. Therefore, that angle is 65°, which equals 3x+6. So 3x+6=65 ⇒ x= (65-6)/3=59/3≈19.666...

Similarly, for the other angle at P in triangle NMP, angle at N is 90°, angle at M is 25°, so angle at P is 65°, which is 4x-2. Thus 4x-2=65 ⇒ x= (65+2)/4=67/4=16.75. Contradiction again. So why is there a contradiction? It must mean that my understanding of the configuration is incorrect.

Perhaps the triangles are not both right-angled at L and N, but the right angles are elsewhere. Wait, the first predicate is Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,P)), 90), which is angle at L between M, L, P. So that's angle at L, making triangle MLP a right triangle with right angle at L. Similarly, angle at N between M, N, P is 90°, making triangle NMP a right triangle with right angle at N. So both triangles are right-angled at L and N respectively. Then, in triangle MLP, angle at M is 25°, angle at L is 90°, so angle at P is 65°, which is MeasureOf(Angle(L,P,M)). Similarly, in triangle NMP, angle at M is 25°, angle at N is 90°, so angle at P is 65°, which is MeasureOf(Angle(N,P,M)). But this leads to two different equations for x, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be another interpretation.

Wait, maybe the angles at M are not both 25°, but the angles at M between L-M-P and N-M-P are 25°, but the actual angles in the triangles are different. Wait, let's clarify:

Angle(L,M,P) is the angle at M between L, M, P. So that's the angle at M between ML and MP, which is 25°, as given. Similarly, Angle(N,M,P) is the angle at M between N, M, P, which is also 25°. So that means that both ML and MN make 25° angles with MP. So if MP is a straight line, then ML and MN are two lines from M making 25° angles with MP, possibly on opposite sides. But then, the right angles at L and N imply that LP is perpendicular to ML and NP is perpendicular to MN.

Let me try to draw this. Let me imagine point M, with MP as a horizontal line. From M, two lines ML and MN make 25° angles with MP, one upwards and one downwards. Then, LP is perpendicular to ML, and NP is perpendicular to MN. So point L is somewhere along ML extended, and point P is such that LP is perpendicular to ML. Similarly for point N.

This creates two right triangles: MLP and NMP, both right-angled at L and N respectively. In triangle MLP, angle at M is 25°, right angle at L. Therefore, angle at P is 65°, as before. Similarly for triangle NMP, angle at M is 25°, right angle at N, so angle at P is 65°. Therefore, both angles at P (Angle(L,P,M) and Angle(N,P,M)) are 65°, which means 3x +6 = 65 and 4x -2 = 65. Solving both gives x=59/3 ≈19.666 and x=67/4=16.75. Contradiction. So this suggests that either the problem is ill-posed, or my interpretation is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles at P are not both 65°. Let me re-examine the triangles. In triangle MLP, angle at P is not necessarily 65°. Wait, if the right angle is at L, then the sum of angles at M and P is 90°. Given angle at M is 25°, then angle at P is 65°, which is correct. So that seems unavoidable. Same for triangle NMP. So the only way for both equations to hold is if 3x +6 = 4x -2, leading to x=8. But then substituting x=8 into both expressions gives 3*8 +6 = 30 and 4*8 -2=30. So both angles at P are 30°, which contradicts the earlier conclusion that they are 65°. This suggests that there's an error in assuming that the angles at P are 65°, but why?

Wait, perhaps the triangles aren't right-angled at L and N, but at P? No, the given states that Angle(M,L,P) is 90°, which is the angle at L. So the right angle is at L. Therefore, the earlier conclusion holds. So there must be another factor. Maybe the diagram isn't a simple triangle? Or perhaps there's overlapping or intersection points?

Wait, maybe points L and N are not distinct? Or maybe there's a miscalculation in the angle sums. Let me double-check the angle sum in triangle MLP. If angle at L is 90°, angle at M is 25°, then angle at P is 180 - 90 - 25 = 65°, correct. Similarly for triangle NMP. So that suggests that both angles at P are 65°, but the given expressions are 3x +6 and 4x -2. So equating them gives x=8, but then 3x+6=30 and 4x-2=30, which would mean that both angles at P are 30°, not 65°. This contradiction suggests that my entire approach is wrong.

Alternative idea: Perhaps the angles at P are not the third angles of the triangles, but something else. Let me think about the full structure. Points M, L, N, P. We have two right angles at L and N. Angles at M between ML and MP, and between MN and MP are 25° each. So if I imagine point P such that it forms two right angles at L and N, and ML and MN are at 25° to MP. Maybe P is located such that both LP and NP are perpendicular to ML and MN, respectively. This could form a quadrilateral MLNP with right angles at L and N, and angles at M of 25° each.

But how do the angles at P relate? Let me think about the full quadrilateral. If I connect points L and N, maybe forming a quadrilateral MLNP. With angles at L and N being right angles, and angles at M being 25° each. But without knowing more about the sides or other angles, it's hard to determine the angles at P.

Alternatively, since LP is perpendicular to ML, and NP is perpendicular to MN, then LP and NP are parallel to each other? Because ML and MN are both at 25° to MP, so their perpendiculars (LP and NP) would be at angles of 90° - 25° = 65° relative to MP? Wait, no. If ML makes 25° with MP, then its perpendicular would make 25° + 90° = 115° with MP? Not sure.

Alternatively, since LP is perpendicular to ML, and ML is at 25° to MP, then LP is perpendicular to ML, so the direction of LP is 25° + 90° = 115° from MP? Or depending on the orientation. This seems too vague without a diagram.

Maybe I should use coordinate geometry. Let's try that.

Let me place point M at (0,0). Let me assume MP is along the positive x-axis, so point P is at (a,0) for some a > 0.

Now, ML makes a 25° angle with MP (which is the x-axis). So the line ML is at 25° above the x-axis. Let me parametrize point L as lying along this line. Let's say point L is at some distance from M. Let me choose coordinates for simplicity. Let me assume ML has length 1 for simplicity. So point L would be at (cos(25°), sin(25°)).

Since LP is perpendicular to ML. The slope of ML is tan(25°), so the slope of LP, being perpendicular, is -cot(25°). The line LP passes through L and is perpendicular to ML. Let me find where this line intersects MP (the x-axis).

The equation of line LP: passing through L(cos(25°), sin(25°)) with slope -cot(25°). The equation is y - sin(25°) = -cot(25°)(x - cos(25°)).

To find where this line meets the x-axis (y=0):

0 - sin(25°) = -cot(25°)(x - cos(25°))  
=> -sin(25°) = -cot(25°)(x - cos(25°))  
Multiply both sides by -1:  
sin(25°) = cot(25°)(x - cos(25°))  
Divide both sides by cot(25°):  
tan(25°) = x - cos(25°)  
Thus, x = cos(25°) + tan(25°)

Compute this numerically:

cos(25°) ≈ 0.9063  
tan(25°) ≈ 0.4663  
So x ≈ 0.9063 + 0.4663 ≈ 1.3726  
So point P has x-coordinate approximately 1.3726, and since it's on the x-axis, y=0. So point P is at (1.3726, 0). 

But earlier, I assumed point P is at (a,0). So this suggests that the position of P depends on the length of ML. But since we are dealing with angles, maybe the actual distances don't matter. Now, similarly for point N.

Point N is such that MN makes 25° with MP (the x-axis), but on the other side. So the line MN is at -25° from the x-axis. Assuming the same length as ML, point N would be at (cos(-25°), sin(-25°)) = (cos(25°), -sin(25°)). Then, line NP is perpendicular to MN. The slope of MN is tan(-25°) = -tan(25°), so the slope of NP is the negative reciprocal, which is cot(25°). The equation of line NP passing through N(cos(25°), -sin(25°)) with slope cot(25°) is:

y + sin(25°) = cot(25°)(x - cos(25°))

Find where this line intersects the x-axis (y=0):

0 + sin(25°) = cot(25°)(x - cos(25°))  
=> sin(25°) = cot(25°)(x - cos(25°))  
Divide both sides by cot(25°):  
tan(25°) = x - cos(25°)  
So x = cos(25°) + tan(25°), same as for point P. So both lines LP and NP intersect the x-axis at the same point P, which is at x ≈ 1.3726. So this confirms that point P is uniquely determined by the conditions.

Now, with this setup, we can calculate the angles at P. Specifically, Angle(L,P,M) is the angle at P between points L, P, M. To find this angle, we need to find the angle between PL and PM.

Vector PL goes from P to L: L is at (cos(25°), sin(25°)), P is at (x_p, 0) = (cos(25°)+tan(25°), 0). So vector PL is (cos(25°) - x_p, sin(25°) - 0) = (cos(25°) - [cos(25°) + tan(25°)], sin(25°)) = (-tan(25°), sin(25°)).

Vector PM goes from P to M: M is at (0,0), so vector PM is (0 - x_p, 0 - 0) = (-x_p, 0).

The angle between vectors PL and PM at point P is Angle(L,P,M). To find this angle, we can use the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (PL · PM) / (|PL| |PM|)

Compute PL · PM = (-tan(25°))*(-x_p) + sin(25°)*0 = x_p * tan(25°)

|PL| = sqrt[ (-tan(25°))^2 + (sin(25°))^2 ] = sqrt(tan²(25°) + sin²(25°))  
= sqrt[(sin²(25°)/cos²(25°)) + sin²(25°)]  
= sqrt[sin²(25°)(1/cos²(25°) + 1)]  
= sin(25°) * sqrt(1/cos²(25°) + 1)  
= sin(25°) * sqrt[(1 + cos²(25°))/cos²(25°)]  
Hmm, this seems messy. Let me compute numerically.

tan(25°) ≈ 0.4663  
x_p = cos(25°) + tan(25°) ≈ 0.9063 + 0.4663 ≈ 1.3726  
So PL · PM = x_p * tan(25°) ≈ 1.3726 * 0.4663 ≈ 0.6396

|PL| = sqrt( (tan(25°))^2 + (sin(25°))^2 ) ≈ sqrt(0.4663^2 + 0.4226^2) ≈ sqrt(0.2174 + 0.1786) ≈ sqrt(0.396) ≈ 0.6296

|PM| = x_p ≈ 1.3726

Thus, cos(theta) ≈ 0.6396 / (0.6296 * 1.3726) ≈ 0.6396 / 0.865 ≈ 0.739

So theta ≈ arccos(0.739) ≈ 42.5 degrees. Wait, but earlier we thought it should be 65°, but this calculation shows it's around 42.5°. So there's a discrepancy. Why?

Because in this coordinate system, the angle at P is not 65°, but around 42.5°. This suggests that my earlier assumption about the angle being 65° was wrong. Where is the mistake?

Earlier, I assumed that in triangle MLP, angle at P is 65°, but this coordinate calculation shows otherwise. Let me re-examine triangle MLP. In this coordinate setup, points M(0,0), L(cos(25°), sin(25°)), P(x_p, 0). Let me compute the angles of triangle MLP.

First, compute lengths of sides:

ML: distance from M to L = sqrt( (cos(25°))^2 + (sin(25°))^2 ) = 1 (as chosen).

MP: distance from M to P is x_p ≈ 1.3726.

LP: distance from L to P: computed earlier as |PL| ≈ 0.6296.

Now, using the Law of Sines for triangle MLP:

sin(angle at M) / LP = sin(angle at L) / MP  
Angle at M is 25°, angle at L is 90°, so:

sin(25°) / 0.6296 = sin(90°) / 1.3726  
Left side: sin(25°)/0.6296 ≈ 0.4226 / 0.6296 ≈ 0.669  
Right side: 1 / 1.3726 ≈ 0.728  
These are not equal, indicating an inconsistency. This suggests that my assumption that angle at L is 90° is incorrect, which conflicts with the given condition that Angle(M,L,P) is 90°. What's the issue here?

Wait, Angle(M,L,P) is the angle at L between M, L, P. In our coordinate system, this is the angle at L between points M, L, P. Let me verify if this angle is indeed 90°.

Vectors LM and LP: LM is from L to M: (0 - cos(25°), 0 - sin(25°)) = (-cos(25°), -sin(25°)). LP is from L to P: (x_p - cos(25°), 0 - sin(25°)) = (tan(25°), -sin(25°)).

Dot product of LM and LP: (-cos(25°))(tan(25°)) + (-sin(25°))(-sin(25°)) = -cos(25°) * tan(25°) + sin²(25°)

tan(25°) = sin(25°)/cos(25°), so:

-cos(25°)*(sin(25°)/cos(25°)) + sin²(25°) = -sin(25°) + sin²(25°) ≈ -0.4226 + 0.1786 ≈ -0.244

For the angle at L to be 90°, the dot product should be zero. But it's -0.244 ≠ 0. This means that my construction is wrong. Why? Because I assumed that LP is perpendicular to ML, but in reality, in this setup, LP is not perpendicular to ML. So where is the mistake?

Earlier, I thought that since Angle(M,L,P) is 90°, then LP is perpendicular to ML. But in reality, the angle at L between ML and LP is 90°, which means that vectors LM and LP are perpendicular. But in my calculation, they are not. So my earlier assumption that LP is perpendicular to ML is incorrect. Instead, the angle at L is 90°, which means that vectors LM and LP are perpendicular. So I need to ensure that.

Let me correct this. Let me redefine point P such that vectors LM and LP are perpendicular. Given that, let's redo the calculation.

Given point M at (0,0), point L at (cos(25°), sin(25°)), and point P somewhere on the x-axis (since MP is along x-axis). Vector LM is from L to M: (-cos(25°), -sin(25°)). Vector LP is from L to P: (x_p - cos(25°), -sin(25°)). Their dot product should be zero:

[-cos(25°)]*(x_p - cos(25°)) + [-sin(25°)]*(-sin(25°)) = 0  
Expand:  
-cos(25°)*x_p + cos²(25°) + sin²(25°) = 0  
Note that cos²θ + sin²θ = 1, so:  
-cos(25°)*x_p + 1 = 0  
=> x_p = 1 / cos(25°) ≈ 1 / 0.9063 ≈ 1.103

So point P is at (1.103, 0). Now, let's recalculate the vectors and angles.

Vector LM is (-cos(25°), -sin(25°))  
Vector LP is (1.103 - cos(25°), -sin(25°)) ≈ (1.103 - 0.9063, -0.4226) ≈ (0.1967, -0.4226)

Check dot product: (-cos(25°))*(0.1967) + (-sin(25°))*(-0.4226)  
= -0.9063*0.1967 + 0.4226*0.4226  
≈ -0.178 + 0.1786 ≈ 0.0006, which is approximately zero, confirming perpendicularity.

Now, let's compute the angle at P in triangle MLP. Let's find the angle at P between points L, P, M. To find this angle, we can use vectors PL and PM.

Vector PL is from P to L: (cos(25°) - x_p, sin(25°) - 0) ≈ (0.9063 - 1.103, 0.4226) ≈ (-0.1967, 0.4226)  
Vector PM is from P to M: (0 - x_p, 0 - 0) = (-1.103, 0)

Compute the angle between vectors PL and PM. Using the dot product:

cos(theta) = (PL · PM) / (|PL| |PM|)

PL · PM = (-0.1967)(-1.103) + (0.4226)(0) ≈ 0.2168 + 0 = 0.2168

|PL| = sqrt((-0.1967)^2 + (0.4226)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.0387 + 0.1786) ≈ sqrt(0.2173) ≈ 0.466

|PM| = 1.103

So cos(theta) ≈ 0.2168 / (0.466 * 1.103) ≈ 0.2168 / 0.514 ≈ 0.422

Thus, theta ≈ arccos(0.422) ≈ 65 degrees. Ah, there we go! So the angle at P is indeed 65°, matching our earlier calculation. This resolves the contradiction. So in this corrected setup, the angle at P in triangle MLP is 65°, which is equal to 3x +6. So 3x +6 = 65 → x = (65-6)/3 = 59/3 ≈19.666... Similarly, for the other angle at P in triangle NMP, which is also 65°, so 4x -2 = 65 → x = (65+2)/4 = 67/4 = 16.75. Still a contradiction. But wait, why is this happening? How can both angles at P be 65°, but the equations give different x?

This suggests that the problem as stated has conflicting conditions, which is unlikely. Therefore, there must be a misinterpretation of the given predicates. Let me revisit the original problem statement.

Original predicates:

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,P)), 90) → Angle at L is 90°  
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(M,N,P)), 90) → Angle at N is 90°  
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(L,M,P)), 25) → Angle at M is 25°  
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(N,M,P)), 25) → Angle at M is 25°  
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(L,P,M)), 3x + 6) → Angle at P in triangle MLP is 3x +6  
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(N,P,M)), 4x - 2) → Angle at P in triangle NMP is 4x -2  

Wait, but if both angles at P are 65°, then both expressions must equal 65°, leading to 3x +6 = 4x -2 → x=8. But in this case, both angles at P would be 3x +6 = 3*8 +6=30 and 4x-2=30, so both are 30°, which contradicts the earlier calculation of 65°. This suggests that my previous calculation was wrong. What's the issue?

Let me recalculate the angle at P with x=8. If x=8, then Angle(L,P,M)=3*8+6=30°, and Angle(N,P,M)=4*8-2=30°. So both angles at P are 30°, which would mean that in both triangles MLP and NMP, the angle at P is 30°, and the right angles at L and N. Let's see if this is possible.

In triangle MLP, angle at L is 90°, angle at P is 30°, so angle at M is 60°. But the given says that MeasureOf(Angle(L,M,P)) is 25°, which is the angle at M between L and P, which would be 25°. But according to this, it should be 60°. Contradiction. So this suggests that there's a fundamental flaw in the setup.

Wait, the given says MeasureOf(Angle(L,M,P)) is 25°, which is the angle at M between L, M, P. In the triangle MLP, this is the angle at M, which we previously thought was 25°, but if the angle at P is 30°, then the angle at M would be 60°, not 25°. So this is a contradiction.

This indicates that the problem as stated contains inconsistencies, which is unlikely. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the predicates. Let me re-express all the given predicates carefully.

The predicates are:

1. Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,P)), 90) → Angle at L is 90°, between M-L-P.
2. Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(M,N,P)), 90) → Angle at N is 90°, between M-N-P.
3. Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(L,M,P)), 25) → Angle at M is 25°, between L-M-P.
4. Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(N,M,P)), 25) → Angle at M is 25°, between N-M-P.
5. Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(L,P,M)), 3x + 6) → Angle at P is 3x +6, between L-P-M.
6. Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(N,P,M)), 4x - 2) → Angle at P is 4x -2, between N-P-M.

So, the angle at M between L and P is 25°, and similarly between N and P is 25°. This means that in both triangles MLP and NMP, the angle at M is 25°, and the angle at L and N are 90°, respectively. Thus, in triangle MLP, angles are: at M: 25°, at L: 90°, so at P: 65°. Similarly for triangle NMP: at M: 25°, at N: 90°, so at P: 65°. Therefore, both angles at P are 65°, which must equal 3x+6 and 4x-2. Hence, 3x+6=4x-2 → x=8, and both angles at P are 3*8+6=30 and 4*8-2=30. But this contradicts the earlier calculation that they should be 65°. So where is the error?

Ah! Here's the key realization: The angle at P in the predicate MeasureOf(Angle(L,P,M)) is not the angle in triangle MLP, but the external angle at P. Wait, no. Angle(L,P,M) is the angle at P between points L, P, M. So it is the angle at P in triangle MLP, which we've determined should be 65°, but according to the given, it's 3x +6. So 3x +6 = 65 → x=59/3. Similarly, for the other angle, 4x-2=65 → x=67/4. This is a contradiction, indicating that the problem is flawed or there's a misinterpretation.

However, since the problem provides answer choices, it's likely that I'm missing something. Let me reconsider the possibility that the angles at P are supplementary to the ones in the triangles. For example, if the angle at P is outside the triangle, but that would require more information.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles at P are not the internal angles of the triangles, but something else. For example, if the lines LP and NP extend beyond P, forming reflex angles. But that seems unlikely.

Another possibility: Maybe the angle at P in MeasureOf(Angle(L,P,M)) is not the internal angle of triangle MLP, but the angle between PL and PM, which could be supplementary to the internal angle. For instance, if the triangle is drawn differently, but this requires more precise analysis.

Let me take the coordinate example where x=8. If x=8, then Angle(L,P,M)=30° and Angle(N,P,M)=30°. Let's see if this is consistent with the other given angles.

In this scenario, in triangle MLP, angle at M is 25°, angle at P is 30
