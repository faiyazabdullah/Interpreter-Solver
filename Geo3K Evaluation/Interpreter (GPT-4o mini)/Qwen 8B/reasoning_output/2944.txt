MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we need to find the measure of angle 2 given that angle 1 is 30 degrees. The quadrilateral WXYZ is a rectangle. Let me start by recalling some properties of rectangles. 

First, in a rectangle, all angles are right angles, so each angle should be 90 degrees. But wait, the problem mentions angles 1 and 2. Maybe these aren't the usual angles of the rectangle? Wait, maybe they're referring to some other angles formed by diagonals or something?

Looking at the given predicates, there are several lines mentioned. For example, Line(W,Z) and Line(X,Y) are diagonals because they mention IsDiagonalOf for those lines in the quadrilateral. Also, Point A is the midpoint of both diagonals. That suggests that the diagonals bisect each other, which is a property of parallelograms, and since it's a rectangle, which is a type of parallelogram, that holds true.

Now, the problem says that angle 1 is 30 degrees. Let me try to visualize the diagram. Since WXYZ is a rectangle, sides WX, XY, YZ, and ZW are all connected. Diagonals WZ and XY intersect at point A, which is their midpoint. 

Wait, but in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal in length and bisect each other. However, they don't necessarily form any specific angles unless certain conditions are met. But here, there are some angles mentioned. Let me check the given angles. 

The predicates list several angles: Angle(W,Y,Z), Angle(Y,W,X), Angle(Y,X,Z), Angle(W,Z,Y), Angle(W,A,Z), Angle(Y,A,X). Hmm, so angle 1 and angle 2 might refer to two of these. The question states that m∠1 = 30°, and asks for ∠2. 

Let me think about how these angles relate. For instance, Angle(W,Y,Z) would be at point Y, between points W, Y, Z. Similarly, Angle(Y,W,X) is at point W between Y, W, X. Wait, but in a rectangle, adjacent angles are supplementary. Wait, but if we consider the diagonals splitting the angles... 

Alternatively, perhaps angle 1 and angle 2 are angles formed by the intersection of the diagonals. Since the diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other but aren't perpendicular unless it's a square. However, the problem doesn't state it's a square, just a rectangle. So the diagonals would split each other into two equal parts, but the angles between them could vary. 

But given that there are some equalities in the predicates. For example, Equals(Angle(W,Y,Z), Angle(Y,W,X)) and Equals(Angle(Y,X,Z), Angle(W,Z,Y)). So angle(W,Y,Z) equals angle(Y,W,X), and angle(Y,X,Z) equals angle(W,Z,Y). 

Let me try to label the diagram mentally. Let's say W is one corner of the rectangle, X next, Y opposite, Z the fourth. So connecting W-X-Y-Z-W. Then diagonals are WZ and XY. Their intersection is point A, the midpoint. 

So, considering diagonal WZ and diagonal XY intersect at A. Now, looking at the angles around point A. The angles formed by the intersection of the diagonals. In a rectangle, the diagonals are congruent and bisect each other, but they are not necessarily perpendicular. Unless the rectangle is a square. 

But the problem gives us some angle measures. For example, angle(W,Y,Z) equals angle(Y,W,X). Let me parse that. Angle(W,Y,Z) is at point Y, between W-Y-Z. Since WXYZ is a rectangle, angle at Y is 90 degrees. Wait, but that contradicts unless... Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation. Wait, in standard notation, angle ABC is the angle at point B. So angle(W,Y,Z) is the angle at Y between points W, Y, Z. Similarly, angle(Y,W,X) is the angle at W between Y, W, X. 

Wait, but in a rectangle, each angle is 90 degrees. So angle at Y (which is angle XYZ?) No, in the rectangle WXYZ, the vertices are ordered such that each consecutive pair forms a side. So, the rectangle has four right angles. Therefore, angle at Y is 90 degrees. So angle(W,Y,Z) is part of that angle. Wait, maybe those angles are not the internal angles of the rectangle but angles formed by the diagonals?

Wait, perhaps angle(W,Y,Z) refers to the angle at Y between WY and YZ. Wait, but WY isn't a side; WY is a diagonal? Wait, the diagonals are WZ and XY. So WY isn't a diagonal. Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let me re-examine the given predicates. 

Looking back, Line(W,Y) and Line(X,Z) are present. Also, Line(W,Z) and Line(X,Y) are diagonals. So WZ and XY are diagonals. So, in the rectangle, the diagonals are WZ and XY. Therefore, point A is the midpoint of both diagonals. 

Now, considering the angles mentioned. Let's take Angle(W,Y,Z): that's the angle at Y between points W, Y, Z. Since Y is a vertex of the rectangle, and W and Z are points connected via the diagonal? Wait, no. W is connected to X, Y is connected to X and Z. Wait, perhaps I need to sketch this mentally again. 

Assume rectangle WXYZ with vertices in order W, X, Y, Z. So sides are WX, XY, YZ, ZW. Then diagonals are WY and XZ? Wait, but according to the predicates, the diagonals are WZ and XY. Wait, that seems conflicting. Because normally, the diagonals connect opposite corners. If the quadrilateral is WXYZ, then the diagonals would be WY and XZ. But according to the given predicates, IsDiagonalOf(Line(W,Z), Quadrilateral(W,X,Y,Z)) and IsDiagonalOf(Line(X,Y), Quadrilateral(W,X,Y,Z)). So Line(W,Z) and Line(X,Y) are diagonals. 

Therefore, the diagonals are WZ and XY. That implies that the rectangle is arranged such that connecting W to Z and X to Y are the diagonals. So in a rectangle, the diagonals are usually the same, so WZ and XY must be congruent. 

So, if we have diagonals WZ and XY intersecting at point A, which is their midpoint. Now, the angles mentioned involve points like W,Y,Z and others. 

For example, Angle(W,Y,Z) is at point Y between W, Y, Z. So that's the angle at Y between segments WY and YZ. Wait, but WY is not a diagonal. Wait, WY would be a segment from W to Y. But in the rectangle, if the diagonals are WZ and XY, then WY isn't a diagonal. Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. 

Wait, the diagonals are WZ and XY. So, in the rectangle, the diagonals are from W to Z and from X to Y. Therefore, the other diagonals (like WY and XZ) are not considered here. So, in this case, the diagonals are WZ and XY. 

So, point A is the midpoint of both diagonals. Therefore, WA = AZ and XA = AY. Now, considering the angles. Let's look at Angle(W,Y,Z). This is the angle at Y between points W, Y, Z. So, since Y is a vertex of the rectangle, connected to X and Z. So, segment YX and YZ are sides of the rectangle. Wait, but W is connected to X, and Z is connected to Y. So, WY is a diagonal from W to Y. Wait, but WY is not one of the diagonals listed. The diagonals are WZ and XY. So, WY is another diagonal? Or is it not? 

This is getting confusing. Maybe I need to clarify the structure of the rectangle. Let me try to assign coordinates to make it clearer. Suppose we place the rectangle on a coordinate system. Let me assume W is at (0,0), X at (a,0), Y at (a,b), and Z at (0,b). Then the diagonals would be WZ from (0,0) to (0,b)? No, that's vertical. Wait, no, in this case, the diagonals would be from W(0,0) to Y(a,b), and from X(a,0) to Z(0,b). These are the standard diagonals. However, according to the given predicates, the diagonals are Line(W,Z) and Line(X,Y). 

In my coordinate system, Line(W,Z) would be from (0,0) to (0,b), which is vertical. Line(X,Y) is from (a,0) to (a,b), also vertical. That can't be, because in a rectangle, the diagonals are supposed to cross each other. If both diagonals are vertical, they wouldn't intersect except if they are the same line. Which they aren't. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, my assumption about the labeling of the rectangle must be wrong. 

Perhaps the rectangle is labeled differently. Let me try another arrangement. Suppose the rectangle is labeled W, X, Y, Z in order such that the diagonals are WZ and XY. So, for example, if W is at (0,0), X at (a,0), Y at (a,c), and Z at (d,e). Wait, but that complicates things. Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is a diamond shape where the sides are not aligned with axes. 

Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is such that the diagonals are WZ and XY, which means that the sides are WX, XY, YZ, and ZW. So, connecting W to X to Y to Z to W. Then, the diagonals are from W to Z and from X to Y. In this case, if it's a rectangle, then the diagonals must be congruent and bisect each other. 

Let me try assigning coordinates again. Let’s suppose that W is at (0,0), X at (a,0), Y at (a,b), Z at (0,b). Then the diagonals would be WZ (from (0,0) to (0,b)) and XY (from (a,0) to (a,b)), which are both vertical lines. They are parallel and do not intersect, which contradicts the fact that diagonals of a rectangle intersect. Hence, this labeling is incorrect. 

Ah! There's the problem. The diagonals in a rectangle are supposed to intersect each other. Therefore, the given diagonals Line(W,Z) and Line(X,Y) must cross each other. Hence, the rectangle cannot be axis-aligned in the way I first thought. Instead, it must be rotated or labeled differently. 

Maybe the rectangle is labeled such that the diagonals are crossing. For example, suppose W is at (0,0), X at (a,b), Y at (c,d), Z at (e,f), but this is too vague. Alternatively, think of a rectangle where the diagonals are WZ and XY, which cross each other. So, WZ connects W to Z, and XY connects X to Y. For them to cross, the points must be arranged such that these diagonals intersect. 

Another approach: since A is the midpoint of both diagonals, then WA = AZ and XA = AY. Therefore, the diagonals bisect each other, which is a property of parallelograms. And since it's a rectangle, which is a parallelogram, this holds. 

Now, considering the angles given. For example, Angle(W,Y,Z) and Angle(Y,W,X) are equal. Let's focus on Angle(W,Y,Z). This is the angle at Y between W, Y, Z. So, in terms of the rectangle, Y is connected to X and Z. So, segment YX and YZ are sides of the rectangle. Therefore, angle at Y is between YX and YZ, which should be 90 degrees. But if that's the case, then why is Angle(W,Y,Z) being compared to another angle? 

Wait, maybe Angle(W,Y,Z) is not the internal angle of the rectangle but an angle formed by a diagonal. For example, if we draw diagonal WZ, then at point Y, there might be an angle between WY and YZ. But earlier confusion arises about whether WY is a diagonal. 

Wait, the diagonals are WZ and XY. So, WY is not a diagonal. Therefore, the segment WY is not one of the diagonals. So, Angle(W,Y,Z) would be the angle at Y between WY and YZ. But since WY is not a diagonal, but a segment from W to Y. 

This is getting complicated. Perhaps I need to use the given equalities. It says Equals(Angle(W,Y,Z), Angle(Y,W,X)). Let's denote these angles as ∠1 and ∠2. The problem states that m∠1 = 30°, and asks for m∠2. 

Assuming that ∠1 is Angle(W,Y,Z) and ∠2 is Angle(Y,W,X), or vice versa. Given that they are equal, and if ∠1 is 30°, then ∠2 is also 30°, making answer A. But that seems too straightforward. However, the options include 30 as choice A. But I need to verify. 

Wait, but maybe these angles are not the ones directly given. Let me think again. The problem says "Find the measure of ∠2 if m∠1 = 30." So, likely, ∠1 and ∠2 are different angles, possibly formed by the diagonals. 

Since the diagonals intersect at A, creating various angles. Let's imagine the intersection of diagonals WZ and XY at point A. The diagonals divide each other into two equal parts. In a rectangle, the diagonals are congruent and bisect each other, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. 

At the intersection point A, the angles formed depend on the rectangle's proportions. For example, if the rectangle is a square, all angles formed by the diagonals are 90°, but in a non-square rectangle, the angles would be acute and obtuse. 

Suppose the diagonals intersect at A, forming vertical angles. Let's call one of the angles formed by the intersection as θ. Then, the vertical angles would be θ and its supplement (180° - θ). 

Now, if we can relate these angles to the given angles in the problem. 

Given that Angle(W,Y,Z) equals Angle(Y,W,X). Let's analyze these angles. 

Angle(W,Y,Z) is at point Y, between points W, Y, Z. Since Y is connected to X and Z in the rectangle. So, if we consider the diagonal WZ, then at point Y, the segment YZ is one side of the rectangle, and the other part of the angle would be from Y to somewhere. Wait, WY is not a diagonal, but if we consider the diagonal WZ, then W is connected to Z. So, from Y, drawing a line to W? Not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe Angle(W,Y,Z) refers to the angle between WY and YZ. If WY is a diagonal, but earlier we said that the diagonals are WZ and XY. So, WY would be a different line. 

This confusion suggests I need to better understand the structure. Let me try to use the given predicates. 

The given predicates include Line(W,Y), Line(X,Z), Line(W,Z), Line(X,Y), etc. Wait, Line(W,Y) is a side? Or is it a diagonal? Wait, the diagonals are WZ and XY. So, Line(W,Y) is not a diagonal. So, WY is a side? No, in the rectangle, the sides are WX, XY, YZ, ZW. So, WY would be a diagonal. Wait, but the diagonals are specified as WZ and XY. So, this suggests that WY is not a diagonal, hence, WY must be a side? That can't be. 

Wait, this is very confusing. Maybe the key lies in the angles given. Let's take Angle(W,Y,Z) and Angle(Y,W,X). 

Angle(W,Y,Z) is at Y, between W-Y-Z. If Y is a vertex of the rectangle, then W and Z are connected via a diagonal? Or not. Let me think of the rectangle as having vertices W, X, Y, Z in order. Then, the sides are WX, XY, YZ, ZW. The diagonals are WY and XZ. But the given diagonals are WZ and XY. So, this implies that the labeling of the rectangle is different. 

Perhaps the rectangle is labeled W, X, Y, Z in such a way that the diagonals are WZ and XY. So, for example, W connected to Z, and X connected to Y. Thus, the rectangle would have sides WX, XY, YZ, and ZW. But then, the diagonals would be WZ and XY. 

So, in this case, the diagonals are WZ and XY, which intersect at point A, the midpoint. Now, considering the angles. At point Y, between W, Y, Z. So, if I imagine point Y, connected to X and Z. The segment YZ is a side of the rectangle, and the segment YX is another side. But where does W come into play? 

If the diagonal is XY (connecting X to Y), then at point Y, the diagonal XY ends. But the segment WY would be another line. So, Angle(W,Y,Z) is the angle at Y between WY and YZ. Similarly, Angle(Y,W,X) is the angle at W between Y, W, X. 

Wait, maybe these angles are formed by the diagonals and the sides. For example, if we have diagonal WZ (from W to Z) and diagonal XY (from X to Y), intersecting at A. Then, at point Y, the diagonal XY starts, and the side YZ goes from Y to Z. Also, the diagonal WZ passes through Y? No, because diagonal WZ goes from W to Z, so it passes through point A, the midpoint. But point Y is another vertex. 

I think I need to accept that without a diagram, this is challenging, but relying on the given predicates and the properties of rectangles. 

Given that the diagonals are WZ and XY, intersecting at A. Since it's a rectangle, the diagonals are congruent and bisect each other. So, WA = AZ and XA = AY. 

Now, consider the angles involving these diagonals. When two diagonals intersect, they form vertical angles. Let's say the intersection creates angles α and β, where α + β = 180°. 

Now, the problem mentions that Angle(W,Y,Z) equals Angle(Y,W,X). Let's assume these are angles formed by the diagonals and the sides. 

Take Angle(W,Y,Z): at point Y, between WY and YZ. If WY is a diagonal, but earlier we said the diagonals are WZ and XY. So, WY is not a diagonal. Hence, WY is a line from W to Y, which may not be a diagonal. 

Alternatively, maybe WY is a side? No, because in the rectangle, the sides are WX, XY, YZ, ZW. So, WY would be a diagonal. But the given diagonals are WZ and XY. So, this suggests that WY is not a diagonal. 

This is very confusing. Maybe the key lies in the equality of angles. The problem says Equals(Angle(W,Y,Z), Angle(Y,W,X)). Let's assume that these are two angles that are equal. If m∠1 is 30°, then m∠2 is also 30°, leading to answer A. But I need to confirm. 

Alternatively, these angles could be complementary or supplementary. For example, if ∠1 and ∠2 are adjacent angles formed by the intersection of diagonals, their sum might be 90° or 180°. 

But without knowing which angles are which, it's hard to tell. Another approach: since the diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other and are congruent, the triangles formed by the diagonals are congruent. For example, triangle WAX ≅ triangle ZAY, etc. 

But again, without knowing which angles are which, it's difficult. 

Wait, the problem mentions that Angle(W,Y,Z) equals Angle(Y,W,X). Let's consider these two angles. 

Angle(W,Y,Z) is at Y, between W-Y-Z. 
Angle(Y,W,X) is at W, between Y-W-X. 

These angles could be alternate interior angles or something. 

In a rectangle, since all angles are 90°, but if we consider the diagonals, maybe these angles are formed by the diagonals and the sides. 

For example, if we draw diagonal WZ, then at point Y, the angle between WY and YZ. But if WY is not a diagonal, this is unclear. 

Alternatively, maybe these angles are related to the properties of the diagonals. For instance, if the diagonals are not perpendicular, then the angles formed at their intersection would be unequal. 

However, the given equalities suggest that certain angles are equal. 

Given that, and the fact that the problem provides m∠1 = 30°, and asks for ∠2, which is equal to ∠1 due to the given equality. Hence, ∠2 would also be 30°, making answer A. 

But I need to ensure this is correct. Let me think again. 

If the given predicates state that Angle(W,Y,Z) equals Angle(Y,W,X), and assuming that ∠1 is Angle(W,Y,Z) and ∠2 is Angle(Y,W,X), then they are equal. So, if m∠1 is 30°, then m∠2 is also 30°, which would be answer A. 

But why would these angles be equal? Maybe due to symmetry or properties of the rectangle. For example, if the diagonals are congruent and bisect each other, certain triangles formed are congruent, leading to equal angles. 

Yes, this seems plausible. Therefore, the answer would be A. 

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me check again. 

Alternatively, maybe ∠1 and ∠2 are angles formed by the diagonals. For example, if the diagonals intersect at A, forming vertical angles. If one of those angles is 30°, then its vertical angle is also 30°, and the adjacent angles would be 150°. But the problem says m∠1 = 30°, and asks for ∠2. If ∠2 is the adjacent angle, then it would be 150°, but none of the options include that. So this scenario doesn't fit. 

Alternatively, if ∠1 and ∠2 are angles formed by the diagonals and sides, and due to the rectangle's properties, they are equal. 

Given the time I've spent and the lack of clarity, I'll go with the initial conclusion that the angles are equal, hence answer A.
