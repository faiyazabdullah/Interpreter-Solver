MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out everything provided.

We have points labeled A through H and J. There are several lines mentioned: Line(A,B), Line(A,E), Line(A,F), Line(B,C), Line(B,D), Line(E,F), Line(C,D), Line(F,G). Also, there are angles specified: Angle(A,E,F) measures 15 degrees, and Angle(F,C,D) measures 95 degrees. Additionally, some points lie on certain lines, like E on Line(A,F), C on Line(B,D), D on Line(B,C), and F on Line(I,C). Wait, but there's also a Circle(I) mentioned. Hmm, maybe point I is the center of the circle? Not sure yet.

The question asks for the measure of angle B, given that m∠A is 10 degrees. Wait, ∠A—probably referring to angle at point A? But which angle? Since there are multiple lines connected to A: A is connected to B, E, and F. So maybe ∠EAF or another angle involving A?

Let me try to sketch mentally. Points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J. Lines connecting them. Let me note down the connections:

Lines:
- AB connects A to B
- AE connects A to E
- AF connects A to F
- BC connects B to C
- BD connects B to D
- EF connects E to F
- CD connects C to D
- FG connects F to G

Angles given:
- ∠AEF is 15°, so at point E between A-E-F?
Wait, Angle(A,E,F) would mean vertex at E, with segments EA and EF. So yes, angle at E between A and F is 15°. Similarly, Angle(F,C,D) is angle at C between F-C-D? Wait, no. Angle(F,C,D) would be vertex at C, with segments FC and CD. So angle at C between F and D is 95°.

Also, PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(A,F)) means E is on the line AF. So E is somewhere along the line from A to F. Similarly, C lies on BD, D lies on BC, and F lies on IC. Wait, Line(I,C)—so point I is connected to C via a line. But I is part of the Circle(I)? Maybe I is the center of the circle, since it's mentioned as Circle(I). So perhaps I is the center, and F lies on line IC, meaning that line IC passes through F. 

Now, the question is about the measure of ∠B. Which angle at point B? Since B is connected to A, C, and D. So angles at B could be ∠ABC or ∠ABD or something else. But without more info, need to deduce.

Given that m∠A is 10°, but which angle? The problem says "m∠A = 10". In geometry, typically, ∠A refers to the angle at vertex A formed by two adjacent sides. Given that A is connected to B, E, F, so possible angles at A are ∠BAE, ∠BAF, or ∠EAF. Wait, but ∠EAF was given as 15°, so that's fixed. However, the question says m∠A = 10°, which might refer to another angle at A. Maybe ∠BAE or ∠BAF? Or perhaps another angle?

Wait, the problem states "What is the measure of ∠B if m∠A = 10?" So maybe ∠A here refers to one of the angles at A, which we need to figure out. But since ∠AEF is already given as 15°, and the question gives m∠A as 10°, maybe that's another angle at A. For example, if ∠BAE is 10°, then combining with ∠AEF=15°, maybe forming a larger angle at A?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a triangle involved where angle A is part of. Let me think.

First, let me try to map out the diagram step by step.

Start with point A connected to B, E, F. Then, E is on line AF, so line AF includes points A, E, F. So AF is a straight line with E between A and F. Then, line EF exists, which is part of that same line. Then, line BC connects B to C; line BD connects B to D. Also, line CD connects C to D. So points B, C, D form a triangle? Because B connected to C and D, and C connected to D. Also, point C lies on BD (since PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(B,D))), so C is on BD. Therefore, BD is a line segment from B to D, with C lying somewhere on it. Similarly, D lies on BC (PointLiesOnLine(D, Line(B,C))). Wait, that seems conflicting unless B, C, D are colinear. Wait, if D lies on Line(B,C), then B, C, D are colinear. But earlier, C lies on Line(B,D), which suggests that B, C, D are colinear. So that implies that points B, C, D are colinear. So BD is a straight line passing through C. Hence, line BD has points B, C, D in order? Or depending on position. So line BD is extended beyond B and D, with C between them? Or C could be between B and D? Let me assume that C is between B and D, making BD a straight line with C in between.

Then, line CD connects C to D, but since C and D are on the same line BD, that line CD is just part of BD. So that might imply that CD is overlapping with BD? Wait, but line CD is given as a separate entity. Maybe there's confusion here. Alternatively, maybe point D is connected to C, forming another line. Wait, the line CD connects C to D. But if C is on BD, then line CD is part of BD. So that might not add much new information. Maybe there's a triangle or another structure.

Additionally, point F lies on line IC. Since there's a circle centered at I, and F is on line IC. So line IC passes through F. So F is a point on the circle? If I is the center, then line IC is a radius. So F is on the circumference if IC is a radius. Wait, but the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(F, Line(I,C)), which means F is on the line from I to C. So F is somewhere on that line, possibly inside or outside the circle. But since I is the center, and C is a point, then line IC is a radius. So F being on that line could be anywhere along that line. Maybe F is the intersection of line IC with some other line? Like line EF?

Also, line EF connects E and F. Since E is on AF, and F is on IC, which connects to C. So line EF connects E (on AF) to F (on IC). Also, angle at E, ∠AEF is 15°, which is between EA and EF.

So putting this together, perhaps there's a triangle involving points A, E, F, with angle at E being 15°, and line EF connected to other parts.

But the main goal is to find the measure of ∠B. Let's consider what ∠B refers to. Since B is connected to A, C, and D. If B is connected to C and D, and C is on BD, then angle at B could be ∠ABC or ∠ABD. Depending on where the other points are.

But how do these elements connect? Let's see:

Since we have angles at E and C given, maybe we can use triangle properties or cyclic quadrilaterals, or something else.

Let me try to look for triangles where angles are known. We know ∠AEF = 15°, and ∠FCD = 95°. Also, the angle at A is given as 10°, which probably relates to another angle in the diagram.

Assuming that ∠A refers to angle at A between BA and EA or FA. Since E is on AF, then angle between BA and AF would be split into ∠BAE and ∠EAF. Wait, if E is on AF, then line AE is part of AF. So ∠BAE is part of ∠BAF. If ∠EAF is 15°, and if ∠BAF is composed of ∠BAE + ∠EAF, then if ∠BAF is given as 10°, then ∠BAE would be negative, which doesn't make sense. So that can't be. Therefore, maybe ∠A refers to a different angle.

Alternatively, maybe ∠A refers to ∠BAE, which is 10°, and ∠EAF is 15°, making ∠BAF = 10° + 15° = 25°? But that depends on whether those angles are adjacent. Since E is on AF, then ∠BAE and ∠EAF share the side AE and AF, respectively. Wait, if E is on AF, then ∠BAE is the angle between BA and AE, while ∠EAF is between EA and AF. Since E is on AF, AF is a straight line, so EA is a segment from E to A, but since E is on AF, then AE is part of AF. Wait, that's confusing. Let me clarify:

Points A, E, F are colinear because E lies on line AF. So the line AF goes from A through E to F. Therefore, ∠EAF is the angle at point A between EA and AF. Wait, but EA and AF are colinear? No, wait: E is on AF, so AF is a straight line. So EA is part of AF. So the angle between EA and AF would be zero, since they're the same line. That contradicts the given ∠EAF = 15°. Therefore, my understanding must be wrong.

Ah! Wait, Angle(A,E,F) is the angle at point E between A-E-F. So the vertex is E, with segments EA and EF. So the angle at E between A and F. So that's correct. So E is a point such that A-E-F forms a straight line? No, because if that were true, then angle at E would be 180°, but it's given as 15°, so that's not the case. Therefore, E is not on the line AF, but rather, the line AF contains point E? Wait, no—the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(A,F)). So E is on the line AF. Wait, that would mean that E is a point on line AF, so A---E---F or A---F---E, depending on direction. So in that case, the angle at E between A-E-F would be a straight angle if A, E, F are colinear. But the given angle is 15°, so that can't be. This contradiction suggests a misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe I misread the predicate. Let me check again: "PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(A,F))" means that point E lies on the line AF. So E is on line AF, which makes A-E-F collinear. Therefore, the angle at E between A-E-F should be 180°, but the given angle is 15°. That's impossible. Therefore, there must be an error in my interpretation.

Wait, maybe the Angle(A,E,F) is not the angle at E, but the angle at A? Wait, no. In standard notation, Angle(X,Y,Z) means the angle at Y between X-Y-Z. So Angle(A,E,F) is the angle at E between A-E and E-F. So that would require that E is not on the line AF. But according to the predicate, E is on line AF. Therefore, this seems contradictory. Unless the angle is not between A-E and E-F but something else. Wait, but the line AF contains E, so points A, E, F are colinear. Therefore, the angle at E between A-E and E-F would be a straight angle (180°), but the problem states it's 15°. This is a contradiction. How is this resolved?

This suggests that either there's a mistake in the problem setup, or my interpretation of the predicates is incorrect. Let me re-examine the predicates carefully.

Wait, the predicate says "PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(A,F))"—does that mean that E is on the line AF? Yes. So that would place E on AF, making A-E-F collinear. But then the angle at E between A-E-F would be 180°, conflicting with the given 15°. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Unless there's another line or something else. Wait, maybe the angle isn't between A-E and E-F, but between A-E and another line? No, the angle is defined as Angle(A,E,F), which is specifically at E between A-E and E-F. So this seems inconsistent.

Wait, maybe the angle is not formed by those three points, but there's a typo? Or perhaps the angle is at A? No, the first letter is the vertex. Alternatively, maybe the angle is between E-A and E-F, but if E is on AF, then that would still be a straight angle. This suggests that there's a fundamental inconsistency in the given predicates. But since this is a problem posed to solve, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the angle is not between A-E and E-F, but between A-E and another line involving F? Wait, but the angle is explicitly given as Angle(A,E,F), so it's at E. This is very confusing. Alternatively, maybe the line AF is not straight? But lines are straight by definition. Therefore, this seems like a paradox. How can E be on AF and have angle at E between A-E-F be 15°? It can't. So there must be a misunderstanding in interpreting the predicates.

Wait, perhaps the predicate is written incorrectly? Maybe it's supposed to say that E lies on line CF instead of AF? Or another line? Alternatively, maybe the angle is at A, not at E? If the angle is at A between E and F, then it would make sense. For example, if the angle is ∠EAF, which would be at A between E and F. But the given angle is Angle(A,E,F), which by standard notation is at E. So that's conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe there's a misinterpretation of the angle's notation. Maybe it's not Angle(A,E,F) but something else. Or perhaps the angle is formed by other lines. Let me think differently. Suppose that even though E is on AF, the angle at E is formed by other lines. For instance, maybe there's a line from E to another point, creating the angle. But the given angle is Angle(A,E,F), which should involve lines EA and EF. But if E is on AF, then EA and EF are parts of the same line, making the angle 180°. Therefore, this seems impossible. 

This suggests that there's a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the predicates. Let me check again the original problem statement.

Original predicates include:

PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(A,F)) — E is on line AF.

Angle(A,E,F) — which would be the angle at E between A-E-F.

But with E on AF, that angle cannot exist unless the lines EA and EF are not colinear, which they are. This is a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps there's a misread in the problem. Maybe the angle is actually at A? If it were Angle(A,E,F) at A, then it would be the angle between EA and FA, which would make sense. But according to standard notation, the middle letter is the vertex. So that would require the angle to be at E. 

This is a critical issue. Without resolving this, the rest of the problem can't proceed. Perhaps the problem assumes that despite E being on AF, the angle is considered somehow otherwise? Or maybe it's a typo, and the angle is at A? Assuming that, let me proceed hypothetically.

Suppose that the angle is at A, between E and F, i.e., ∠EAF = 15°. Then, since E is on AF, that would mean that ∠EAF is a straight angle, which conflicts again. Wait, no—if E is on AF, then A-E-F is a straight line, so ∠EAF would be 180°, but the problem says it's 15°, which is still impossible. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is not at E or A, but at F? If the angle is at F, then Angle(A,E,F) would be at F between A-F-E. But that would require F to be the vertex. But the middle letter is E, so that's not the case. 

At this point, I'm stuck due to the contradiction in the given predicates. However, since this is a problem meant to be solved, I must have made a wrong assumption. Let me try to reinterpret the predicates.

Perhaps "PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(A,F))" means that E is on line AF, but the angle is not directly related. Maybe there's another construction. For example, even though E is on AF, there's another line involving E that creates the angle. For instance, if there's a line from E to another point, say, creating angle at E between EA and EC, but the problem states the angle is between A-E-F. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is not in the plane of the diagram? Unlikely. 

Another possibility: the angle is formed by extending lines. For example, if AF is extended beyond F to some point, creating an angle at E. But the problem states the angle is between A-E-F, implying that the angle is formed by EA and EF. 

I think I need to move forward assuming that there's a mistake in the problem, but since I have to solve it, perhaps I should proceed with the given data, ignoring the contradiction, or assume that the angle is at A. Let me try that.

Assume that ∠EAF = 15°, which would be at A between E and F. Since E is on AF, this would suggest that E is between A and F, making AE a part of AF. Then, ∠EAF is the angle between EA and AF, but since E is on AF, this would be zero. Still impossible. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is formed by lines from A to E and from A to F, but E and F are not on the same line. Wait, but the predicate says E is on AF, so that's not possible. 

This is very confusing. Maybe the problem involves non-collinear points? Wait, but E is on AF, so they are collinear. 

Perhaps the angle is not between EA and EF, but between EA and another line. For example, maybe there's a line from E to another point, forming the angle. But the given angle is Angle(A,E,F), which specifies the three points. 

At this point, I'm unable to resolve the contradiction, so I'll have to make an assumption to proceed. Let me assume that there's a typo and that the angle is at A, not at E. So ∠EAF = 15°, which would mean that at point A, between E and F. Since E is on AF, this implies that E is between A and F, making AE a part of AF. Thus, ∠EAF would be zero, which still doesn't fit. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is at F. So ∠EFA = 15°, which would make sense if F is the vertex. But the given angle is Angle(A,E,F), so that would be at E. 

I think I've exhausted all possibilities and am stuck. To move forward, perhaps I should focus on the other given information. For example, the angle at C is 95°, and there's a relationship between points C, D, F, etc. 

Given that, maybe I can work on the other parts and see if I can derive relations that don't rely on the problematic angle. 

For example, considering the angle at C, ∠FCD = 95°, which is at point C between F and D. Since C lies on BD (from PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(B,D))), and D lies on BC (PointLiesOnLine(D, Line(B,C))), which implies that B, C, D are colinear. So line BD passes through C, and D is on BC. Wait, that would mean that D is between B and C? Or C is between B and D? Let me clarify:

If PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(B,D)), then C is on line BD. And PointLiesOnLine(D, Line(B,C)), which means D is on line BC. So line BC and line BD are the same line, since D is on BC and C is on BD. Therefore, points B, C, D are colinear. So line BD is the same as line BC. Thus, D is a point on line BC. 

So, considering that, angle at C between F and D is 95°. So ∠FCD = 95°. So at point C, between F and D. Since C is on BD, and D is on BC, then line CD is part of BD. Therefore, ∠FCD is the angle between FC and CD. Since CD is part of BD, this angle is between FC and BD at point C. 

Maybe there's a triangle involving F, C, and D. If we can find some relationships there, perhaps we can use the given angle of 95°. 

Also, there's a circle centered at I, and F lies on line IC. So line IC passes through F. Maybe there's a way to use circle properties here, like inscribed angles or something. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to tell. 

The question asks for the measure of ∠B, which likely refers to an angle at point B. Since B is connected to A, C, and D. If B, C, D are colinear, then angle at B could be ∠ABC or ∠ABD. 

Let me assume that ∠B refers to ∠ABC. To find its measure, we might need to use triangle properties or other angles. 

But how does the given angle at A (10°) come into play? If we can relate the angles around point A to other parts of the diagram. 

Given that I'm stuck with the initial contradiction, perhaps I should focus on the other given angle of 95° at C and see if I can build relationships from there. 

Let me consider triangle FCD. At point C, ∠FCD = 95°. If I can find other angles in this triangle, maybe I can find some relations. But I need more information about the sides or other angles. 

Also, point F is on line IC, which connects to point C. So line IC passes through F. If I can relate this to other parts of the diagram. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involving point A and others where the given angle of 10° plays a role. 

But without resolving the initial contradiction regarding the angle at E, it's challenging to proceed. 

Perhaps the problem intended the angle at A to be 10°, and the angle at E to be 15°, with E not on AF. But that would contradict the given predicate. 

In conclusion, despite the contradictions in the given predicates, I'll proceed under the assumption that there's a misstatement, and the angle at E is 15°, and try to find relationships. 

Assuming that, let's try to proceed:

With ∠AEF = 15° (at E), and ∠FCD = 95° (at C). Also, ∠A = 10°, which might refer to another angle at A. 

If I can find triangles where these angles are part of, and use the sum of angles or other theorems. 

For example, suppose there's a triangle involving A, E, F. If ∠AEF = 15°, and if we know other angles in that triangle, we can find missing ones. 

But without knowing the other angles, it's difficult. 

Alternatively, focusing on point B, since we need to find ∠B. If points B, C, D are colinear, and there's a triangle involving B, C, F, or B, C, D. 

At this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on typical problems. Often, such problems involve supplementary angles or using the fact that angles in a triangle sum to 180°. 

Given that ∠FCD = 95°, which is quite large, and the other angle at A is 10°, perhaps there's a way to combine these. 

If I imagine triangle ABC, where ∠A is 10°, and we need to find ∠B. But without knowing other angles or sides, it's unclear. 

Alternatively, maybe the angles at E and C are part of larger structures, and using the fact that the sum of angles around a point is 360°, or something similar. 

Another idea: since points B, C, D are colinear, and there's an angle at C of 95°, maybe that forms part of a triangle with point F. If we can find the other angles in that triangle. 

For example, in triangle FCD, we know one angle is 95° at C. If we can find other angles, we can find the third. But without more info, it's tricky. 

Alternatively, if there's a straight line at B, and the angle at B is supplementary to some other angle. 

Given that I'm running out of ideas, and considering the answer choices are numerical, perhaps there's a calculation involving adding or subtracting the given angles. 

For instance, if the total of angles around a point is 360°, or if the angles in a triangle sum to 180°. 

Suppose that the angle at B is related to the given angles of 15° and 95°. Adding 15 + 95 = 110, which is not among the options. Subtracting 95 - 15 = 80, also not matching. 

Alternatively, 180 - 15 - 95 = 70, which isn't an option. 

Wait, the given answer choices are 30, 35, 47.5, 90. 

If I consider that the angle at B is half of 75° (which is 37.5), but that's not in the options. 

Alternatively, maybe it's related to the supplement of 95°, which is 85°, and then subtracting 15°, giving 70°, still not matching. 

Alternatively, if there's a triangle where angles are 10°, 15°, and something, leading to the remaining angle. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's too speculative. 

Considering that the answer choices include 35, which is half of 70, or 47.5, which is 95 - 47.5 = 47.5, or maybe a combination. 

Alternatively, if the angle at B is 180 - 95 - 15 = 70°, but that's not an option. 

Wait, the question says "if m∠A = 10", so maybe ∠A is part of a triangle with angles 10° and 15°, and the third angle is 155°, but again, not helpful. 

Given that I'm stuck, and the options are limited, perhaps the correct answer is B (35). But this is a shot in the dark. Alternatively, since 95 - 15 = 80, and 80 divided by something... 

Alternatively, if there's a triangle with angles 10°, 95°, and x, then x = 75°, which is not an option. 

But since I can't proceed further due to the unresolved contradiction in the problem setup, I'll have to choose an option based on common problems. In many cases, angles in such configurations often lead to 35° as a common answer. So I'll go with B.
