MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have a rectangle WXYZ, and we need to find the measure of angle 6, given that angle 1 is 30 degrees. Hmm, first things first, since it's a rectangle, I know all the angles in a rectangle are right angles, so each corner is 90 degrees. But wait, the problem mentions angle 1 and angle 6. Maybe these angles are formed by some diagonals or something?

Wait, rectangles have two diagonals that bisect each other and are equal in length. If there are diagonals, they might form triangles inside the rectangle. Let me visualize this. Suppose the rectangle has vertices W, X, Y, Z in order. Then the diagonals would connect opposite corners, like W to Y and X to Z. These diagonals intersect at the center point. When diagonals intersect, they form vertical angles. So maybe angles 1 and 6 are those vertical angles? Or perhaps they're adjacent angles?

But the problem says m∠1 = 30°, so angle 1 is 30 degrees. Wait, but in a rectangle, the diagonals should split each other into two equal parts. If the diagonals are equal and bisect each other, then the triangles formed by the diagonals should be congruent. However, in a rectangle, the diagonals aren't perpendicular unless it's a square. So maybe the angles formed by the intersection of the diagonals depend on the sides' lengths?

Let me think. Suppose the rectangle isn't a square. Let’s say the sides WX and XY are different lengths. Then the diagonals would create triangles where the angles depend on the ratio of the sides. For example, if one side is longer than the other, the angles made by the diagonals would be acute or obtuse. Since angle 1 is given as 30°, maybe angle 6 is related through vertical angles or supplementary angles.

Wait, if the diagonals intersect, they form two pairs of vertical angles. So if angle 1 is 30°, then its vertical angle would also be 30°, and the adjacent angles would be supplementary, so 180 - 30 = 150°. But the problem refers to angle 6. Depending on how the angles are labeled, angle 6 could be either the vertical angle to angle 1 or another angle. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is not formed by the diagonals but by some other construction. For instance, sometimes problems involve drawing a diagonal and then considering angles with other lines. Wait, but without seeing the diagram, I need to make assumptions based on standard labeling.

Another possibility: In a rectangle, if you draw a diagonal, say from W to Y, then that divides the rectangle into two congruent right triangles. Each triangle has angles of 90°, and the other two angles depend on the sides. If angle 1 is one of those angles in the triangle, then maybe angle 6 is related. But if angle 1 is 30°, then the other non-right angle would be 60°, because angles in a triangle add up to 180. So if angle 1 is 30°, then the other angle would be 60°. But how does that relate to angle 6?

Wait, maybe angle 6 is the angle formed by the diagonal and a side. For example, if angle 1 is part of triangle WXY, then angle at X would be 90°, and if the diagonal splits it, creating angles. But again, without the diagram, it's challenging. But the problem gives answer choices including 30, 45, 60, 90. 

Since angle 1 is 30°, and assuming angle 6 is vertically opposite or adjacent. If angle 1 is 30°, then vertical angles would also be 30°, making angle 6 possibly 30°, which is option A. But maybe angle 6 is supplementary? Like if angle 1 is 30°, then angle next to it is 150°, but that's not in the options except D=90. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, if angle 6 is part of a different triangle. 

Wait, another thought: In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other, forming two congruent triangles. If angle 1 is formed at the intersection of the diagonals, then it's part of a triangle. For instance, if the diagonals intersect at O, then triangle WOZ would have angles. But in that case, if angle 1 is at O, then depending on the rectangle's proportions, the angles could vary. However, in general, unless it's a square, the angles formed by the diagonals aren't necessarily 45°. 

Wait, but if angle 1 is 30°, then angle 6, being vertical, would also be 30°, so answer A. But maybe angle 6 is another angle. Wait, maybe angle 6 is an exterior angle? For example, if there's a transversal or something. But without knowing the diagram, this is tricky. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is an angle outside the rectangle. For example, if there's a triangle attached to the rectangle. But again, without the diagram, it's hard. However, given that answer options include 30, which is the same as angle 1, maybe angle 6 is equal to angle 1 due to vertical angles. Therefore, the answer would be A. But I need to confirm.

Wait, but in a rectangle, if you draw diagonals, the angles formed at the intersection depend on the rectangle's aspect ratio. For example, if the rectangle is very long and skinny, the angles near the longer sides would be small. So if angle 1 is 30°, then angle 6 could be 30°, or maybe 60°, depending on which angle it is. But if angle 1 is one of the acute angles formed by the diagonals, then angle 6 might be the corresponding vertical angle, hence same measure. So answer A. However, if angle 6 is the other angle in the triangle, then it could be 60°, which is option C. 

Hmm, conflicting possibilities. How to decide? Well, the problem states that WXYZ is a rectangle. Let me consider that the diagonals divide the rectangle into four triangles. Each pair of vertical angles. So if angle 1 is one of them, then angle 6 is either vertical (same) or supplementary. If angle 1 is 30°, then the adjacent angle would be 150°, but none of the options are 150. However, if angle 6 is part of a different triangle, perhaps. 

Wait, but if angle 1 is at the intersection of the diagonals, then the sum of angles around that point is 360°. So if angle 1 is 30°, then the opposite angle is 30°, and the other two angles would be 180° - 30° = 150° each. But again, unless angle 6 is one of those 150°, which isn't in the options. So maybe angle 6 is referring to another angle. 

Alternative approach: Since it's a rectangle, all angles are 90°. But if angle 1 is formed by a diagonal, then maybe angle 1 is part of a triangle. For example, suppose we have triangle formed by diagonal WY and side WX. Then angle at W would be 90°, angle at X is... Wait, no. Let me clarify. 

If you take diagonal WY, connecting W to Y. Then in triangle WXY, which is a right triangle. The angles at W and X are original angles of the rectangle, which are 90°, but wait, no. Wait, triangle WXY would have angles at W, X, and Y. Wait, no. Let me get this straight. Points W, X, Y, Z. So sides WX, XY, YZ, ZW. Diagonals WY and XZ. 

In triangle WXY, points W, X, Y. Angle at X is 90°, since it's a rectangle. So triangle WXY is a right triangle with right angle at X. The other two angles are at W and Y. The sum of angles is 180°, so angles at W and Y add up to 90°. If angle 1 is one of those angles, say at W, then angle at W would be 30°, making angle at Y 60°. Then angle 6 could be angle at Y, which would be 60°, so answer C. 

So if angle 1 is one of the acute angles in the right triangle formed by the diagonal, then angle 6 could be the other acute angle, which would be 60°, making answer C. 

But how do we know which angle is referred to as angle 1 and angle 6? Without the diagram, it's ambiguous, but given the answer choices, both A and C are possible. However, common problems often use such setups where angle 1 is one acute angle, leading to angle 6 being the complementary angle. 

Alternatively, if angle 1 is formed by the intersection of diagonals, then angle 1 is 30°, and angle 6 could be vertical, so same measure, answer A. But which scenario is more likely?

Given that the problem is presented with answer choices including 30 and 60, and the fact that in a rectangle with diagonals, the angles formed can be acute or obtuse, depending on the rectangle's shape. Since angle 1 is given as 30°, which is acute, angle 6 could be its vertical counterpart, hence 30°, or it could be the complement in the triangle, giving 60°. 

But how to choose between A and C? Let's think about typical textbook problems. Often, when a diagonal is drawn in a rectangle, and an angle is mentioned, it's referring to the angles within the triangle. For example, if angle 1 is one of the acute angles in the right triangle, then the other angle would be 60°, so answer C. But if angle 1 is formed by the intersection of the diagonals, then vertical angles would be equal, so answer A. 

However, the problem states "Quadrilateral WXYZ is a rectangle." The mention of angle 6 suggests that the angles are labeled in the diagram. Commonly, in such diagrams, angles formed by the diagonals are labeled sequentially. For example, if diagonals intersect at point O, then angles around O are labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. If angle 1 is 30°, then vertical angles would be equal, so angle 3 would be 30°, and adjacent angles would be supplementary. But if angle 6 refers to another angle, like the supplement, but that's not in options. 

Alternatively, if angle 1 is one of the angles formed by the diagonal and a side, like in triangle WXY, then angle at W is 30°, making angle at Y 60°, so angle 6 might refer to that. Hence, answer C. 

Considering that in many problems, especially with rectangles, the angles formed by diagonals are often considered in the context of the triangles, I think the intended answer is C. But I'm not entirely sure. 

Wait, but if angle 1 is 30°, and the rectangle's diagonals intersect, forming angles. The sum of angles around the intersection point is 360°. If one angle is 30°, then the opposite angle is also 30°, and the other two angles are 180° - 30° = 150° each. So if angle 6 is one of those 150°, but that's not among the options. Unless angle 6 is referring to another angle. 

Alternatively, if angle 6 is part of a different triangle. For example, if there's another diagonal or something. But without more info, it's guesswork. Given that the answer choices include 30 and 60, and considering that angle 1 is 30°, which is an acute angle, and angle 6 could be its complement in a right triangle, making 60°, which is answer C. 

Therefore, I'll go with answer C.
