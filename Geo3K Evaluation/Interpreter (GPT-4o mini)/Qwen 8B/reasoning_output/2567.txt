MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we need to find the measure of angle FGE given that quadrilateral EFGH is a rectangle and that the measure of angle HGE is 13 degrees. Let me start by recalling the properties of a rectangle.

First, a rectangle has four right angles, so each angle inside it should be 90 degrees. Also, opposite sides are equal and parallel. Now, looking at the given predicates, there are several things mentioned. For instance, they mention diagonals EG and FH intersecting at point K. Also, there are right angles at HEF and HEK. Wait, the right angles are given as Angle(H,E,F) and Angle(E,H,K). Hmm, maybe I need to visualize this.

Let me try to sketch the figure mentally. Points E, F, G, H form a rectangle. So, connecting them in order would make EF, FG, GH, HE as the sides. The diagonals are EG and FH, which intersect at K. In a rectangle, diagonals bisect each other, so K is the midpoint of both diagonals. Also, since diagonals in a rectangle are equal in length and bisect each other, but do they have any other properties? Well, they also create some triangles that might be congruent or have certain angles.

Now, the problem states that angle HGE is 13 degrees. Wait, angle at G between HG and GE. Since EFGH is a rectangle, HG is one side, and GE is a diagonal. So, angle HGE is part of triangle HGE. Let me think about triangle HGE. In this triangle, HG is a side of the rectangle, GE is a diagonal, and HE is another side. But wait, in a rectangle, adjacent angles are supplementary. However, since it's a rectangle, all angles are 90 degrees. 

Wait, but if we consider triangle HGE, then angle at G is 13 degrees. Let me recall that in a rectangle, the diagonals divide the angles into two parts. Wait, but in a rectangle, the diagonals aren't necessarily angle bisectors unless it's a square. Oh, right! Because in a general rectangle, the diagonals are equal but not perpendicular unless it's a square. Therefore, the angles formed by the diagonals with the sides may not be equal. 

So, angle HGE is given as 13 degrees. That means that in triangle HGE, angle at G is 13 degrees. Let me see. Let's denote the rectangle as EFGH with points in order. So, sides are EF, FG, GH, HE. Diagonals EG and FH intersect at K. So, point K is where the diagonals cross. 

Given that angle HGE is 13°, which is angle at G between HG and GE. Let me note that HG is a vertical side (assuming standard position) and GE is the diagonal from G to E. So, in triangle HGE, angle at G is 13°, and we know that HE is a side of the rectangle. Wait, HE is a side of the rectangle, so HE is equal to FG. But how does that help?

Alternatively, perhaps considering triangle HGE. Since EFGH is a rectangle, HE is congruent to FG, and HG is congruent to EF. But maybe more importantly, the triangle HGE has sides HG, GE, and HE. Let me think about the angles here. Since angle at G is 13°, and angle at H? Wait, in the rectangle, angle at H is 90°, but angle HGE is part of that. Wait, no. At point H, the angle of the rectangle is 90°, but angle HGE is part of triangle HGE. Let me clarify.

In the rectangle, the corner at H is 90°, so angle EHG is 90°, because HE and HG meet at H. But angle HGE is different; that's the angle between HG and GE. So, in triangle HGE, we have angle at G is 13°, angle at H is 90°, and angle at E would be... Let me check. The sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, so angle at E would be 180 - 90 -13 = 77°. So angle at E in triangle HGE is 77°. 

But how does this relate to the rest of the problem? The question asks for angle FGE, which is the angle at G between FG and GE. So, angle FGE. Let me visualize that. Point F is connected to G, and GE is the diagonal from G to E. So, angle FGE is at point G, between FG and GE. 

Since EFGH is a rectangle, FG is a horizontal side (if we imagine the rectangle standing upright), and GE is the diagonal going from G to E. So, angle FGE is adjacent to angle HGE. Wait, because at point G, there are two sides: FG and GH. The diagonal GE splits the angle at G. Wait, but in a rectangle, each angle is 90°, so the diagonal divides the 90° angle into two angles. However, in this case, angle HGE is given as 13°, which suggests that the diagonal GE creates an angle of 13° with side HG. Then, the other angle at G (between FG and GE) would be 90° minus 13°, which is 77°. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. 

Wait, hold on. Let me re-examine. In the rectangle, at vertex G, the two adjacent sides are FG and GH. The diagonal GE connects G to E. So, the diagonal GE splits the 90° angle at G into two angles: one between FG and GE (which is angle FGE), and one between GE and GH (which is angle HGE, given as 13°). Therefore, those two angles should add up to 90°, because they are adjacent and form the right angle at G. So, angle FGE + angle HGE = 90°. Given that angle HGE is 13°, then angle FGE is 90° -13°=77°. 

Therefore, the measure of angle FGE is 77 degrees. Looking at the answer choices, option D is 77. So, the answer should be D. 

But let me double-check if there's anything I missed. The problem mentions that the diagonals intersect at K, and there are right angles at HEF and HEK. Wait, the given predicates say RightAngle(Angle(H,E,F)) which is angle HEF, which is the right angle at E of the rectangle. And RightAngle(Angle(E,H,K)), which is angle HEK. Since K is the intersection of diagonals, in a rectangle, the diagonals bisect each other, so EK equals KG. Also, since diagonals are equal, but not sure if that affects the angles here. 

However, my previous reasoning was based on the fact that at point G, the angle between FG and GH is 90°, split by the diagonal GE into two angles. Since angle HGE is 13°, then angle FGE is 90 -13=77. This seems correct. But why is the problem providing all those other predicates? Maybe to confirm that it's indeed a rectangle, ensuring that the angles are right angles. For example, the presence of right angles at HEF and HEK confirms that the diagonals intersect at K such that the segments like EK and HK are perpendicular? Wait, no. The RightAngle(Angle(E,H,K)) implies that at point H, angle between EH and HK is 90 degrees. Wait, but that might not directly affect our current problem. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way that triangle EKG or something else is involved. But regardless, the key idea is that at point G, the two angles created by the diagonal GE are complementary, adding up to 90 degrees. Hence, angle FGE is 90-13=77. Therefore, the answer is D.
