MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, we have points E, F, H, G all lying on a circle C. There are two angles mentioned: Angle(E,H,F) which measures 8x + 6 degrees, and Angle(F,G,E) which is 10x - 4 degrees. The question is to find x. 

First, I need to recall some geometry concepts here. Since all these points are on a circle, maybe there's something about inscribed angles or central angles? Wait, but the angles mentioned aren't necessarily inscribed angles unless they're subtended by certain arcs. Let me think.

Looking at Angle(E,H,F). That means vertex at H, with sides HE and HF. Similarly, Angle(F,G,E) has vertex at G, with sides GF and GE. But since all points are on the same circle, perhaps these angles relate to arcs on the circle?

Wait, if H is on the circle, then maybe those angles are inscribed angles. Inscribed angles are half the measure of their intercepted arcs. However, depending on where the points are placed, the intercepted arcs could vary. Also, without knowing the exact configuration, it's tricky. But maybe there's another relationship here.

Alternatively, maybe these two angles are part of a cyclic quadrilateral? Or maybe there's a way to relate them via some property of the circle. Another thought: if points E, F, G, H are on the circle, then maybe the angles formed by connecting them have some relation. For example, opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral sum to 180 degrees. But wait, do these angles form a quadrilateral? Let me visualize.

Let me sketch mentally: Points E, F, G, H on a circle. Suppose we connect them in order. But the angles given are Angle(E,H,F) and Angle(F,G,E). Hmm. So Angle(E,H,F) would be at point H, so that's angle EHF. And Angle(F,G,E) is at point G, so angle FGE. Are these angles related? Maybe they are vertical angles or supplementary? Not sure yet.

Wait, if these angles are inscribed angles intercepting arcs, then their measures depend on the arcs they intercept. Let me denote the measure of angle EHF as 8x + 6, which is an inscribed angle. Then the arc EF that it intercepts would be twice that measure. Similarly, angle FGE is 10x - 4, which is also an inscribed angle intercepting arc FE? Wait, maybe not. Because angle at G, so angle FGE intercepts arc FE? Wait, inscribed angle at G intercepting arc FE would be half the measure of arc FE. But angle EHF intercepts arc EF. Wait, but if points E, F, H, G are arranged on the circle, then the arcs between them would matter.

Alternatively, maybe these angles are adjacent or something. Let me think again. Suppose points E, F, G, H are on the circumference. Let me consider the arcs between them. For instance, angle EHF intercepts arc EF, so its measure is half the arc EF. Similarly, angle FGE intercepts arc FE. Wait, but angle FGE is at point G, so the intercepted arc would be arc FE. Wait, but that would mean angle FGE is half of arc FE, just like angle EHF is half of arc EF. Therefore, they would be equal? But according to the equations, they are different expressions. Unless there's something wrong with my assumption.

Wait, maybe the angles intercept different arcs. Let me check again. Angle EHF is at H, so the angle is formed by chords HE and HF. Therefore, it intercepts arc EF that doesn't contain H. Similarly, angle FGE is at G, formed by chords FG and GE, so it intercepts arc FE that doesn't contain G. Now, if the points are arranged such that H and G are positioned so that these arcs are related. For example, if the entire circle is divided into arcs by points E, F, G, H, then the arcs EF and FE are the same, but maybe the other arcs involve more points. Alternatively, perhaps there's a relationship between these two angles because they are part of intersecting chords or something.

Alternatively, maybe these two angles are vertical angles or something else. Wait, but how? Let me think of another approach. Suppose that angles EHF and FGE are angles in the same circle. Is there a theorem that relates them? Maybe not directly. Wait, but if these angles are part of a cyclic quadrilateral, then opposite angles would sum to 180 degrees. However, I don't know if EFGH forms a cyclic quadrilateral. Wait, but all points are on the circle, so yes, EFGH is a cyclic quadrilateral. But then, if that's the case, then maybe the sum of opposite angles equals 180 degrees. But angle EHF and angle FGE are not necessarily opposite angles. Let me see:

In cyclic quadrilateral EFGH, the opposite angles would be angle E and angle G, angle F and angle H. But the angles given here are angle EHF (which is angle at H) and angle FGE (angle at G). So if we consider quadrilateral EFGH, then angle at H and angle at G are consecutive angles. Their sum would not necessarily be 180 degrees. So that may not help directly.

Another idea: Maybe the two angles given are related via the fact that they intercept arcs that add up to something. For example, if angle EHF intercepts arc EF, and angle FGE intercepts arc FE, then they are actually the same arc, so their measures should be equal. But according to the equations, they are 8x +6 and 10x -4. Setting them equal gives 8x +6 = 10x -4 → 6 +4 = 10x -8x → 10=2x → x=5. Which is one of the options, answer B. But why would they be equal?

Wait, but if angle EHF and angle FGE both intercept the same arc EF, then they would be equal. But that requires that both angles are inscribed angles intercepting the same arc. However, angle EHF is at point H, so it intercepts arc EF. Angle FGE is at point G, so it intercepts arc FE. Wait, but arc FE is the same as arc EF, just traversed in the opposite direction. So their measures are the same. Hence, the measures of angle EHF and angle FGE should be equal. Therefore, setting 8x +6 = 10x -4 leads to x=5. Which is option B.

But wait, why do these angles intercept the same arc? Let me confirm. For angle EHF, the vertex is H, so the intercepted arc is the arc that does not contain H. Similarly, for angle FGE, vertex is G, so intercepted arc is the arc that does not contain G. Depending on the position of H and G relative to arc EF, maybe these arcs are the same. For example, if points E, F, G, H are arranged around the circle such that moving from E to F to G to H and back to E, then arc EF not containing H would be the same as arc FE not containing G? Not sure. Maybe if the points are arranged in order E, F, G, H around the circle, then angle EHF intercepts arc EF, and angle FGE intercepts arc FE. But since arc EF and FE are the same arc, their measures are equal. Therefore, the angles should be equal. Thus, equating their measures gives x=5, which is answer B.

So the key insight here is recognizing that both angles intercept the same arc, making them equal. Therefore, solving 8x +6 = 10x -4 gives x=5. Checking the answer choices, B is 5. That seems correct.
