Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have points A, B, C, D. There are several line segments mentioned: Line(A,C), Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(B,D). Also, there are some right angles indicated: RightAngle(Angle(D,B,C)) and RightAngle(Angle(D,C,B)). Wait, those angles seem similar but maybe different? Let me check. Angle(D,B,C) would be at point B, with sides BD and BC. Similarly, Angle(D,C,B) is at point C, with sides CD and CB. Hmm, so if both these angles are right angles, that suggests that BD is perpendicular to BC and CD is perpendicular to CB? Wait, but BC is a common side here. So if angle at B (between BD and BC) is a right angle, then BD is perpendicular to BC. Similarly, angle at C between CD and CB being a right angle means CD is perpendicular to CB. Therefore, BD and CD are both perpendicular to BC. That implies that points D lies somewhere such that BD and CD are both perpendicular to BC. But wait, if two lines are both perpendicular to the same line BC, they must be parallel to each other. However, since both BD and CD are connected to D, that suggests that D is a single point where both BD and CD are perpendicular to BC. Wait, that can't happen unless BD and CD are parts of the same line. Wait, but BD and CD are separate lines. Maybe D is a point such that BD and CD are both perpendicular to BC, making them colinear? Or perhaps D is positioned such that BD and CD form a right angle with BC?

Wait, let me visualize this. Suppose we have segment BC. Then, if BD is perpendicular to BC, D lies somewhere along the line perpendicular to BC at B. Similarly, CD is perpendicular to BC, so D lies on the line perpendicular to BC at C. But unless B and C are the same point, which they aren't because there's a segment BC. So if BD is perpendicular to BC at B, then D is on one line; CD is perpendicular to BC at C, so D is on another line. Unless D is the intersection point of those two perpendiculars. But if BD is perpendicular to BC at B, and CD is perpendicular to BC at C, then those two lines (BD and CD) would be two different lines perpendicular to BC at different points. Their intersection would be a point D that's not on BC. Wait, but how does that work? Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in interpreting the angles. Let me re-examine the RightAngle predicates. 

RightAngle(Angle(D,B,C)): This is angle at B, formed by points D-B-C. So vertex at B, with sides BD and BC. So BD is one leg, BC is the other leg, forming a right angle at B. Therefore, BD is perpendicular to BC.

Similarly, RightAngle(Angle(D,C,B)): This is angle at C, formed by points D-C-B. Vertex at C, with sides DC and CB. So DC is one leg, CB is the other leg, forming a right angle at C. Hence, DC is perpendicular to CB.

So both BD ⊥ BC and DC ⊥ BC. Therefore, BD and DC are both perpendicular to BC. Which would imply that BD and DC are parallel to each other since they're both perpendicular to the same line BC. But BD and DC are two different segments starting from B and C respectively. However, if both are perpendicular to BC, then BD is vertical (assuming BC is horizontal), and DC is also vertical. Thus, D must lie somewhere along the line perpendicular to BC at B and also along the line perpendicular to BC at C. But unless BC has zero length, which it isn't, those two lines are distinct. Therefore, the only way for D to satisfy both conditions is if D is at infinity, which doesn't make sense. Wait, that can't be right. There must be something wrong here.

Wait, maybe I misread the angle notations. Let me confirm the angle notation. In Angle(D,B,C), the middle letter is the vertex. So yes, angle at B between D and C. Similarly, Angle(D,C,B) is angle at C between D and B. So BD ⊥ BC and CD ⊥ CB. Therefore, BD is perpendicular to BC, and CD is perpendicular to CB. Since CB is the same as BC, just reversed. So CD is perpendicular to BC as well. Therefore, BD and CD are both perpendicular to BC. Therefore, BD || CD. Because they are both perpendicular to the same line. So BD and CD are parallel. But BD connects to B, CD connects to C. So if BD and CD are both perpendicular to BC, then D is located such that it's on both the line perpendicular to BC at B and the line perpendicular to BC at C. Which would mean that D is the intersection point of those two perpendiculars. But unless BC is a straight line, and those two perpendiculars intersect at some point. Wait, but if BC is a straight line, then the perpendiculars at B and C would be two different lines. For example, imagine BC lying horizontally. The perpendicular at B would be vertical upwards from B, and the perpendicular at C would be vertical upwards from C. These two vertical lines are parallel and never meet, unless extended infinitely. Wait, but then D cannot exist unless the two lines are the same, which they aren't unless B=C, which they are not. Therefore, this seems like a contradiction. How can D exist if both BD and CD are perpendicular to BC?

Ah! Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Perhaps the second angle is not at C, but maybe I misread the order. Let me double-check. The first angle is Angle(D,B,C): vertex at B. Second angle is Angle(D,C,B): vertex at C. So yes, both BD and CD are perpendicular to BC. Therefore, BD and CD are both perpendicular to BC, implying that they are parallel. But then D would have to be a point that is on both the line perpendicular to BC at B and the line perpendicular to BC at C. Which is impossible unless BC is a degenerate line. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Unless... unless the two perpendiculars are not both going in the same direction. Like, BD is upward from B, and CD is downward from C, so they could intersect at some point D. Wait, that's possible. If BD is perpendicular to BC at B going up, and CD is perpendicular to BC at C going down, then they could intersect at a point D above BC. Let me draw this mentally. Let's say BC is horizontal. At B, we go up vertically to D. At C, we go down vertically to D. So D would be somewhere above BC, connected to B via BD (upward) and connected to C via CD (downward). Wait, but if CD is perpendicular to BC, then CD would be vertical downwards from C. But then D would be below C, but BD is upwards from B. So unless BC is very long, but even then, D would have to be both above B and below C, which would require that B and C are aligned such that this is possible. Alternatively, maybe the directions of the perpendiculars are both the same. For example, both BD and CD are pointing in the same direction relative to BC. But then, if BC is horizontal, BD and CD would both be vertical upwards. Then, D would be a point that's vertically above both B and C. But unless B and C are the same point, which they are not, that's impossible. So this seems contradictory.

Hmm, maybe there's an error in my interpretation. Let me think again. Perhaps the angles are not both right angles, but the problem states that both are right angles. Wait, the given predicates are:

RightAngle(Angle(D,B,C)) and RightAngle(Angle(D,C,B)). So both angles are right angles. Therefore, BD is perpendicular to BC, and CD is perpendicular to CB (which is the same as BC). Therefore, BD and CD are both perpendicular to BC. So BD and CD are parallel. But how can D be connected to both B and C such that BD and CD are both perpendicular to BC? It's only possible if D is a point where BD is perpendicular to BC and CD is also perpendicular to BC. This requires that D lies on the line perpendicular to BC at B and also on the line perpendicular to BC at C. Which would only be possible if B and C are the same point, but they are distinct since there's a segment BC. Therefore, this seems impossible. There's a contradiction here. But since the problem gives these predicates, there must be a configuration where this is possible. Therefore, I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the angles are not both right angles, but the problem says both are right angles. Let me check again. The user wrote:

- RightAngle(Angle(D,B,C))
- RightAngle(Angle(D,C,B))

Yes, both are right angles. Therefore, angle at B between D and C is a right angle, and angle at C between D and B is a right angle. Therefore, triangle DBC has two right angles at B and C. But a triangle can't have two right angles unless it's degenerate. Wait, but a triangle can't have two right angles. Therefore, this suggests that the figure is not a triangle, but perhaps a quadrilateral or another shape. Wait, but points D, B, C form a triangle? If D is connected to B and C, then triangle DBC would have vertices D, B, C. But with two right angles at B and C, that would make it a degenerate triangle. Therefore, this implies that points D, B, C are colinear? No, because if there are two right angles, that would require that BD and CD are both perpendicular to BC, leading to D being a point where BD and CD are both perpendicular to BC. Which, as discussed earlier, is only possible if D is at infinity. Therefore, this seems impossible. There must be a miscalculation here.

Wait, perhaps the problem involves three-dimensional geometry? But the question didn't specify that. All the given lines are in a plane, I assume. Alternatively, maybe the figure includes more than just the triangle DBC. Let me look at the other predicates. We have Line(A,C), Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(B,D). Also, there are Lengths given for CB, AC, CD, AB, BD. So, the points are A, B, C, D. Let me try to sketch this mentally.

Assume points B and C are fixed. Let me consider BC as a horizontal line. Let me assign coordinates to make it easier. Let me place point B at (0,0) and point C at (c,0) for some c > 0. Now, since BD is perpendicular to BC (from the first right angle), BD is vertical upwards or downwards from B. Let's say upwards. So point D would be at (0, y) for some y. Now, the second right angle is at C, between D and B. So angle at C between D and B is a right angle. So the lines CD and CB form a right angle. Since CB is from C to B, which is leftwards along the x-axis. CD should be perpendicular to CB. CB is horizontal, so CD should be vertical. Therefore, CD must be vertical. Since point C is at (c,0), and CD is vertical, then D must be either directly above or below C. But earlier, D was at (0,y) from the first condition. Therefore, for D to be both at (0,y) and vertically above/below C, which is at (c,0), this requires that (0,y) is vertically aligned with C. That would mean that D is at (c, y) if CD is vertical. Wait, no. Wait, CD is vertical. If C is at (c,0), then CD is vertical, so D has the same x-coordinate as C, i.e., x = c. So D would be at (c, k) for some k. But from the first condition, D must be at (0, y). Therefore, the only way for D to satisfy both is if c=0, which would collapse points B and C, which they aren't. Therefore, this seems impossible. 

This suggests that there's a contradiction in the given predicates. However, since the problem is presented, there must be a resolution. Perhaps my assumption about the direction of the perpendiculars is incorrect. Let me reconsider. Suppose instead that BD is perpendicular to BC, but in the opposite direction. For example, if BC is horizontal from B(0,0) to C(c,0), then BD could be downward from B, so D would be at (0,-y). Meanwhile, CD needs to be perpendicular to CB. CB is from C to B, which is leftward. So CD should be perpendicular to CB. CB is horizontal, so CD must be vertical. Therefore, CD is vertical. Since C is at (c,0), CD is vertical, so D must be at (c, k). But D is already at (0,-y) from the first condition. Therefore, unless c=0, which it isn't, this is impossible. 

Wait, unless the perpendiculars are in different directions. For instance, BD is perpendicular to BC upwards, and CD is perpendicular to BC downwards. Let me see. If BD is upwards from B(0,0), then D is at (0, y). CD is perpendicular to CB. CB is from C to B, which is towards the left. To be perpendicular to CB, CD must be vertical. So CD is vertical, meaning D has the same x-coordinate as C. So D is at (c, k). But D is also at (0, y). Therefore, unless c=0, which it isn't, there's no solution. Therefore, this scenario is impossible. 

This suggests that the given predicates are inconsistent, but since the problem exists, I must be missing something. Maybe the angles are not both in the same orientation. Wait, let me think differently. What if the right angles are not at B and C, but the problem says they are. Let me check again:

First RightAngle: Angle(D,B,C) → vertex at B, sides BD and BC. So angle at B between D and C. Second RightAngle: Angle(D,C,B) → vertex at C, sides CD and CB. So angle at C between D and B. Therefore, both BD ⊥ BC and CD ⊥ CB. So BD and CD are both perpendicular to BC. So BD and CD are both perpendicular to BC, hence parallel to each other. But how can D be connected to both B and C such that BD and CD are both perpendicular to BC? Only if D is at infinity, which is not practical. Therefore, this must mean that the configuration is not in Euclidean plane, or there's an error in the problem setup. But assuming the problem is valid, there must be a way. 

Let me consider that maybe the two right angles are part of a larger structure involving point A. Let me recall that there are Lines A-B, A-C, and others. Given that, maybe the key is to use triangle ABC and some relations with point D. Let me note that there's a triangle ABC, because Line(A,B), Line(A,C), and Line(B,C) are given. So triangle ABC exists. Additionally, there's a point D connected to B and C via lines BD and CD, with the two right angles. 

Perhaps I should assign coordinates to all points to resolve this. Let me try that. Let me set coordinate system with B at (0,0), C at (8.5, 0) since the length of CB is 8.5 units (given by Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,B)),8.5)). Wait, the length of CB is 8.5, which is the distance between C and B. So if I set B at (0,0), then C is at (8.5, 0). 

Now, BD is perpendicular to BC. Since BC is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (8.5,0), the slope of BC is 0 (horizontal). Therefore, BD must be vertical. So BD is vertical, so D has the same x-coordinate as B, which is 0. So D is at (0, d_y) for some d_y. 

Now, CD is perpendicular to CB. CB is horizontal, so CD must be vertical. Therefore, CD is vertical. Point C is at (8.5, 0), so CD is vertical. Therefore, D must have the same x-coordinate as C, which is 8.5. So D is at (8.5, d_y). 

But from the first condition, D is at (0, d_y) and from the second condition, D is at (8.5, d_y). This implies that 0 = 8.5, which is impossible. Therefore, there's a contradiction. 

Wait, unless the second perpendicular is not in the same direction. Let me think: If BD is vertical upwards from B, then D is at (0, d). CD needs to be perpendicular to CB. CB is horizontal, so CD must be vertical. But if CD is vertical, then D must be at (8.5, e) for some e. But D is already at (0, d), so this requires that 0 = 8.5, which is impossible. 

Alternatively, perhaps CD is not vertical but in the opposite direction. Wait, if CB is from C to B, which is leftward. To be perpendicular to CB, CD could be either upward or downward from C. So, suppose CD is vertical upward from C. Then D would be at (8.5, e). But BD is vertical from B, so D is at (0, f). So for D to be both (0,f) and (8.5,e), it's impossible. 

Therefore, this suggests that under standard Euclidean geometry, the given predicates are contradictory. But since the problem exists, perhaps there's a miscalculation or misinterpretation. Let me re-examine the problem statement. 

Wait, maybe the second right angle is not at C but at B? No, the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(D,C,B)), which is at C. 

Wait, could it be that the angle at C is between D, C, B, but the sides are CD and CB? Yes. So angle at C between D and B, meaning that CD and CB are the two legs. Therefore, CD is perpendicular to CB. So CD is perpendicular to CB, which is the same as BC. So CD is perpendicular to BC. 

Given that, and BD is perpendicular to BC, then BD and CD are both perpendicular to BC, hence parallel. But how can D be connected to both B and C such that BD and CD are both perpendicular to BC? It's only possible if D is at infinity. Therefore, this suggests that the problem may involve non-Euclidean geometry or there's an error. However, since the problem asks to find x, which is the length of CD, I need to proceed despite this contradiction. 

Perhaps the key is that the triangle ABD or ADC is involved. Let me recall that there are lines connecting A to B, A to C, and others. Also, the lengths given are:

Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,B)),8.5) → CB = 8.5

Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C)),8.8) → AC = 8.8

Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,D)),x) → CD = x

Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)),z) → AB = z

Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,D)),y) → BD = y

So, perhaps there's a relationship between AB, AC, BC, and other lengths through triangle ABC or other triangles involving D. 

But without knowing the exact configuration of D, it's hard to proceed. However, since the problem includes a right angle at B between D and C, and another right angle at C between D and B, perhaps there's a way to express the coordinates of D in terms of B and C, even though it seems conflicting. 

Let me try assigning coordinates again. Let me take B at (0,0), C at (8.5, 0). Then, BD is perpendicular to BC, so D is at (0, y) for some y. CD is perpendicular to CB, so CD must be vertical, so D must be at (8.5, z) for some z. But this requires that (0,y) = (8.5,z), which implies 0=8.5, which is impossible. Therefore, the only possibility is that the two perpendiculars are in the same direction. For example, both BD and CD are upward. So, BD is vertical upward from B(0,0) to D(0, y), and CD is vertical upward from C(8.5, 0) to D(8.5, y). But then D is two different points: one at (0,y) and another at (8.5,y), which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that D cannot exist in this configuration. 

However, since the problem provides these predicates, there must be a way. Perhaps the error is in assuming that both BD and CD are perpendicular to BC, but actually, one is perpendicular to BC and the other is perpendicular to CB? Wait, CB and BC are the same line, so that doesn't change anything. 

Wait, perhaps the angles are not in the same plane? But that's unlikely. 

Alternatively, maybe the right angles are not both in the same triangle. Let me think: if there's a right angle at B between D and C, and another right angle at C between D and B, then D is forming two right angles with BC. This implies that D is such that it forms a rectangle with BC? No, because a rectangle has four right angles. But here, only two. 

Wait, if I consider quadrilateral BDCC? No, that's not a standard shape. 

Alternatively, perhaps D is a point such that BD is perpendicular to BC and CD is perpendicular to BC, but in different orientations. For example, BD is upward from B, and CD is downward from C. Then, D would be at (0, y) and (8.5, -k). But these are different points. So unless y and -k are such that D is the same point, which would require that (0,y) = (8.5, -k), which implies 0=8.5 and y=-k, which is impossible. 

At this point, I'm stuck. There must be a different approach. Let me focus on the other given data: AC = 8.8, CB = 8.5, and we need to find CD = x. Perhaps there's a relation between these lengths using the right angles. 

Since there are right angles at B and C, maybe triangles ABD and ACD are right triangles? Or maybe triangle ABD or something else. Let me think. 

Wait, if there's a right angle at B between D and C, then triangle DBC has a right angle at B. So triangle DBC is a right triangle with right angle at B. Similarly, triangle DBC has a right angle at C? No, because the second right angle is at C. So triangle DBC has two right angles, which is impossible unless it's degenerate. 

But perhaps the problem is referring to two different triangles? For example, one right angle at B (triangle DBC) and another right angle at C (triangle DBC)? No, that still leads to the same contradiction. 

Wait, maybe the right angles are part of different triangles. For example, the first right angle is in triangle DBC, and the second right angle is in another triangle, like triangle DBC? No, that doesn't help. 

Alternatively, maybe the right angles are in triangles ABD and ACD? Let me think. If there's a right angle at B, maybe involving point A. But the given right angles are at B and C. 

I'm really stuck here. Let me try to think outside the box. Perhaps the diagram includes point A such that AD is involved. Let me recall that there's Line(A,B), Line(A,C), and Line(A,C) has length 8.8. So, point A is connected to B and C. Maybe triangle ABC is involved, and D is a point related to it. 

Given that, maybe there's a way to use the Pythagorean theorem. Let me assume that triangle DBC is a right triangle, even though it has two right angles. But that's impossible. Alternatively, maybe there's a typo in the problem, and one of the right angles is meant to be elsewhere. 

Alternatively, perhaps one of the right angles is at D? No, the given predicates state the right angles are at B and C. 

Wait, let me try to use coordinates again, ignoring the contradiction for a moment. Assume that D has coordinates (0, y) due to the right angle at B, and also (8.5, y) due to the right angle at C. Even though this is mathematically impossible, perhaps there's a way to proceed. Let me calculate the length CD. If D is at (8.5, y), then CD is the distance from C(8.5,0) to D(8.5,y), which is |y - 0| = |y|. Similarly, BD is the distance from B(0,0) to D(0,y), which is |y|. So BD = CD = |y|. Therefore, x = CD = y. Also, the length of BD is y, which is given as equals to y. But how does this relate to other lengths?

Additionally, we know that AC = 8.8, and CB = 8.5. Let me consider triangle ABC. If I can find AB or other lengths, maybe I can relate them to x. 

But without knowing where D is, it's difficult. However, if I assume that D is at (0, y) and (8.5, y), then maybe there's a connection to point A. For example, if A is somewhere such that AD is connected. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem. Maybe the right angles are not both in triangle DBC, but in different triangles. For example, the first right angle is in triangle ABD and the second in triangle ACD? Let me try that. 

If RightAngle(Angle(D,B,C)) means that in triangle DBC, angle at B is right. And RightAngle(Angle(D,C,B)) means that in triangle DBC, angle at C is right. But this is impossible, as before. 

Alternatively, maybe the first right angle is in triangle ABD and the second in triangle ACD. Let me explore this. 

Suppose Angle at B in triangle ABD is right. So, if ABD is a right triangle at B, then AB is perpendicular to BD. Similarly, if Angle at C in triangle ACD is right, then AC is perpendicular to CD. 

In this case, BD is perpendicular to AB, and CD is perpendicular to AC. 

But how does this relate to the previous information? Let me try. 

If BD is perpendicular to AB, and CD is perpendicular to AC, then we have two perpendiculars from B and C. Let me attempt to model this. 

Let me assume point B at (0,0), point C at (8.5,0). Let me denote AB = z and AC = 8.8. 

If BD is perpendicular to AB, then BD is a line from B(0,0) perpendicular to AB. Similarly, CD is perpendicular to AC. 

But without knowing the coordinates of A, this is challenging. However, we can use the fact that AC = 8.8. Let me try to assign coordinates to A. 

Let me assume A has coordinates (a_x, a_y). Then, AB is the distance from A to B(0,0): sqrt((a_x)^2 + (a_y)^2) = z. AC is the distance from A to C(8.5,0): sqrt((a_x - 8.5)^2 + (a_y)^2) = 8.8. 

Also, BD is perpendicular to AB. The slope of AB is (a_y - 0)/(a_x - 0) = a_y/a_x. Therefore, the slope of BD, being perpendicular, is -a_x/a_y. Since BD starts at B(0,0), its equation is y = (-a_x/a_y)x. 

Similarly, CD is perpendicular to AC. The slope of AC is (a_y - 0)/(a_x - 8.5) = a_y/(a_x - 8.5). Therefore, the slope of CD, being perpendicular, is -(a_x - 8.5)/a_y. Since CD starts at C(8.5, 0), its equation is y - 0 = [-(a_x - 8.5)/a_y](x - 8.5). 

Point D lies on both BD and CD. So, solving the equations of BD and CD will give us coordinates of D. 

But this seems complicated, but let's proceed. 

Equation of BD: y = (-a_x/a_y)x. 

Equation of CD: y = [-(a_x - 8.5)/a_y](x - 8.5). 

Setting them equal:

(-a_x/a_y)x = [-(a_x - 8.5)/a_y](x - 8.5)

Multiply both sides by a_y to eliminate denominators:

-a_x x = -(a_x - 8.5)(x - 8.5)

Multiply both sides by -1:

a_x x = (a_x - 8.5)(x - 8.5)

Expand the right-hand side:

a_x x = a_x(x - 8.5) - 8.5(x - 8.5)

a_x x = a_x x - 8.5 a_x - 8.5x + 8.5^2

Subtract a_x x from both sides:

0 = -8.5 a_x - 8.5x + 8.5^2

Rearrange:

8.5 a_x + 8.5x = 8.5^2

Divide both sides by 8.5:

a_x + x = 8.5

So, x = 8.5 - a_x. 

But what is x? In this context, x is the length of CD. Wait, no. In this derivation, x is the variable used in the equation, but in the problem, x represents the length of CD. So this x is the x-coordinate of point D? No, in this case, x is a variable in the equation. Wait, I used x as the x-coordinate in the equation, but in the problem, x is the length CD. This might cause confusion. Let me clarify. 

Actually, in the equation above, x is the x-coordinate of point D. Let me rename it to t to avoid confusion. Let me redefine: 

Let me call the x-coordinate of D as t. Then, the equation becomes:

a_x t = (a_x - 8.5)(t - 8.5)

Expanding:

a_x t = a_x t - 8.5 a_x - 8.5 t + 8.5^2

Cancel a_x t:

0 = -8.5 a_x - 8.5 t + 8.5^2

Which simplifies to:

8.5(a_x + t) = 8.5^2 ⇒ a_x + t = 8.5 ⇒ t = 8.5 - a_x. 

So, the x-coordinate of D is t = 8.5 - a_x. 

Now, to find the coordinates of D, we can substitute back into the equation for BD: y = (-a_x/a_y)t. 

Thus, D has coordinates (t, y_D) = (8.5 - a_x, (-a_x/a_y)(8.5 - a_x)). 

Now, we need to find CD's length. Point C is at (8.5, 0), and D is at (8.5 - a_x, (-a_x/a_y)(8.5 - a_x)). 

The distance CD is sqrt[(8.5 - (8.5 - a_x))^2 + (0 - (-a_x/a_y)(8.5 - a_x))^2] 

Simplify:

sqrt[(a_x)^2 + [(a_x/a_y)(8.5 - a_x)]^2]

Factor out (a_x)^2:

sqrt[ a_x² + (a_x² / a_y²)(8.5 - a_x)^2 ] 

= a_x * sqrt[1 + ((8.5 - a_x)^2)/(a_y²)]

But this expression depends on a_x and a_y, which are coordinates of point A. 

However, we know that AC = 8.8. From earlier, AC is the distance between A(a_x, a_y) and C(8.5, 0):

√[(a_x - 8.5)^2 + (a_y)^2] = 8.8

Square both sides:

(a_x - 8.5)^2 + a_y^2 = 8.8² = 77.44 

Also, AB = z, which is √(a_x² + a_y²) = z. 

So, we have two equations:

1. (a_x - 8.5)^2 + a_y^2 = 77.44 
2. a_x² + a_y^2 = z² 

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

(a_x - 8.5)^2 + a_y^2 - a_x² - a_y^2 = 77.44 - z² 

Expand (a_x - 8.5)^2: a_x² - 17a_x + 72.25 

So:

a_x² -17a_x + 72.25 - a_x² = 77.44 - z² 

Simplify:

-17a_x + 72.25 = 77.44 - z² 

Rearranged:

z² = 77.44 + 17a_x - 72.25 = 5.19 + 17a_x 

But this introduces z, which is AB, but we don't have its value. However, the problem doesn't provide AB's length, so this might not help directly. 

However, our goal is to find x, which is the length CD. Earlier, we had:

CD = a_x * sqrt[1 + ((8.5 - a_x)^2)/(a_y²)] 

But this expression is complex. Let me see if I can express it in terms of known quantities. 

From equation 1: (a_x - 8.5)^2 + a_y^2 = 77.44 

Let me denote Δx = a_x - 8.5, so Δx = a_x - 8.5. Then, equation 1 becomes Δx² + a_y² = 77.44. 

Also, from equation 2: a_x² + a_y² = z². 

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2: 

a_x² + a_y² - (Δx² + a_y²) = z² - 77.44 

=> a_x² - Δx² = z² - 77.44 

But Δx = a_x - 8.5, so Δx² = (a_x - 8.5)^2 = a_x² - 17a_x + 72.25 

Thus:

a_x² - (a_x² - 17a_x + 72.25) = z² - 77.44 

Simplify:

17a_x - 72.25 = z² - 77.44 

Rearranged:

z² = 17a_x - 72.25 + 77.44 = 17a_x + 5.19 

Which matches what we had earlier. 

Now, returning to CD expression:

CD = a_x * sqrt[1 + ((8.5 - a_x)^2)/(a_y²)] 

Note that (8.5 - a_x) = -Δx, so (8.5 - a_x)^2 = Δx². 

So CD = a_x * sqrt[1 + Δx² / a_y²] 

But from equation 1, Δx² + a_y² = 77.44 => Δx² = 77.44 - a_y² 

So CD = a_x * sqrt[1 + (77.44 - a_y²)/a_y²] = a_x * sqrt[1 + 77.44/a_y² - 1] = a_x * sqrt[77.44/a_y²] = a_x * (√77.44)/|a_y|

Assuming a_y ≠ 0. 

So CD = (a_x / |a_y|) * √77.44 

But from equation 2, a_x² + a_y² = z². Let me denote this as equation 2. 

Also, from the expression for CD, we have CD = (a_x / |a_y|) * √77.44. 

Let me square both sides:

CD² = (a_x² / a_y²) * 77.44 

But from equation 2, a_x² = z² - a_y². Substituting:

CD² = (z² - a_y²)/a_y² * 77.44 = (z²/a_y² - 1) * 77.44 

But I'm not sure if this helps. 

Alternatively, let me consider that CD = (a_x / |a_y|) * √77.44. 

Let me denote k = a_x / a_y. Then CD = k * √77.44. 

But k is a_x / a_y. Also, from equation 2: a_x² + a_y² = z². 

Let me write k = a_x / a_y ⇒ a_x = k a_y. Substitute into equation 2:

(k a_y)^2 + a_y^2 = z² ⇒ a_y² (k² + 1) = z² ⇒ a_y² = z² / (k² + 1) 

Then, CD = k * √77.44. 

But I don't know k or z. 

However, we also have from the earlier equation z² = 17a_x + 5.19. Since a_x = k a_y, and a_y² = z²/(k² + 1), then a_y = ± z / sqrt(k² + 1). 

Thus, a_x = k * (± z / sqrt(k² + 1)) 

Substitute into z² = 17a_x + 5.19:

z² = 17 * [k * (± z / sqrt(k² + 1))] + 5.19 

This seems too abstract. Maybe there's another approach. 

Wait, perhaps I can find a relationship between CD and AC. Since AC = 8.8, and CD is expressed in terms of a_x and a_y. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to relate CD to other lengths using the right angles. 

Wait, earlier I found that CD = (a_x / |a_y|) * √77.44. But also, from the right angles, BD is perpendicular to AB. Let me recall that BD is perpendicular to AB. 

The length of BD is y, which is given as Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,D)),y). 

From earlier, the coordinates of D are (8.5 - a_x, (-a_x/a_y)(8.5 - a_x)). 

So the length BD is the distance from B(0,0) to D(t, y_D) where t = 8.5 - a_x and y_D = (-a_x/a_y)(8.5 - a_x). 

So BD² = t² + y_D² = (8.5 - a_x)^2 + [(-a_x/a_y)(8.5 - a_x)]^2 

= (8.5 - a_x)^2 [1 + (a_x^2 / a_y^2)] 

= (8.5 - a_x)^2 [ (a_y^2 + a_x^2) / a_y^2 ]

But from equation 2, a_x² + a_y² = z². 

So BD² = (8.5 - a_x)^2 * (z² / a_y²) 

Thus, BD = (8.5 - a_x) * (z / |a_y|) 

But from earlier, CD = (a_x / |a_y|) * √77.44 

So, if I can relate BD and CD, perhaps through some ratio. 

But I don't know BD or CD. However, the problem asks for CD, which is x. 

But I have two expressions involving a_x, a_y, z. Without additional information, it's difficult to solve. 

Maybe there's a relation between BD and CD. Let me think. 

From earlier, we have:

BD = (8.5 - a_x) * (z / |a_y|)

CD = (a_x / |a_y|) * √77.44 

Let me divide BD by CD:

BD/CD = [(8.5 - a_x) * z / |a_y|] / [a_x * √77.44 / |a_y|] = (8.5 - a_x) z / (a_x √77.44) 

But I don't know the value of z or a_x. 

Alternatively, let me consider that from the earlier equation, z² = 17a_x + 5.19. 

And from equation 1: (a_x - 8.5)^2 + a_y^2 = 77.44. 

Let me expand (a_x - 8.5)^2 = a_x² - 17a_x + 72.25 

So:

a_x² - 17a_x + 72.25 + a_y^2 = 77.44 

But from equation 2, a_x² + a_y^2 = z². 

Substitute into the above:

z² - 17a_x + 72.25 = 77.44 

Rearrange:

z² = 17a_x + 77.44 - 72.25 = 17a_x + 5.19 

Which is consistent with earlier. 

So, z² = 17a_x + 5.19 

But I still have too many variables. 

Is there any other information? The problem gives AC = 8.8, which is fixed. 

Let me think: since AC = 8.8, and from equation 1, (a_x - 8.5)^2 + a_y^2 = 77.44, and AC is 8.8, which is the same as the left-hand side of equation 1. So, that's consistent. 

But how to find a_x and a_y? Without additional constraints, it's not possible. 

Wait, but perhaps there's a way to relate CD to AC. 

Earlier, CD = (a_x / |a_y|) * √77.44. 

But from equation 1, (a_x - 8.5)^2 + a_y^2 = 77.44. Let me expand this:

a_x² - 17a_x + 72.25 + a_y^2 = 77.44 

But a_x² + a_y^2 = z², so:

z² - 17a_x + 72.25 = 77.44 

Which gives z² = 17a_x + 5.19 as before. 

But I still can't find a_x. 

Maybe I need to assume that triangle ABC is a right triangle? But there's no information suggesting that. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to express CD in terms of AC and CB. 

Wait, let me recall that in this scenario, CD is expressed as (a_x / |a_y|) * √77.44. And AC is 8.8, which is √[(a_x - 8.5)^2 + a_y^2] = 8.8. 

Let me denote (a_x - 8.5) = p, and a_y = q. Then, p² + q² = 77.44. 

Also, a_x = p + 8.5. 

So, CD = (a_x / |q|) * √77.44 = (p + 8.5)/|q| * √77.44. 

But from p² + q² = 77.44, we have q² = 77.44 - p². 

Thus, CD = (p + 8.5)/sqrt(77.44 - p²) * √77.44. 

Simplify:

CD = (p + 8.5) * √77.44 / sqrt(77.44 - p²) 

This expression depends on p, which is (a_x - 8.5). But I don't know p. 

However, from earlier, z² = 17a_x + 5.19. Since a_x = p + 8
