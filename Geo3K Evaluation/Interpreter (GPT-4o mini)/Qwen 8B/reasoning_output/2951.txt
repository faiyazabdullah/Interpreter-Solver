Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, we need to find the perimeter of quadrilateral ABCD. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

First, there are some right angles mentioned. The first predicate says RightAngle(Angle(C, A, D)). That means angle at point A between points C and D is a right angle. Then another one: RightAngle(Angle(D, B, C)), so angle at point B between points D and C is also a right angle. 

Next, there are length equalities. Length of AC is 8 units, AD is 4 units, BC is 10 units. Also, it's stated that AC and AD are diagonals of quadrilateral ABCD. Wait, so AC connects A to C, and AD connects A to D? But if AC and AD are diagonals, that suggests that ABCD is a quadrilateral where these two diagonals intersect each other. Hmm, but usually diagonals connect opposite vertices. Wait, in a quadrilateral, there are two diagonals. For example, in a convex quadrilateral ABCD, the diagonals would be AC and BD. But here, they say Line(A,C) and Line(A,D) are diagonals. That seems odd because AD would be a side if D is connected to A. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something here. Let me think again.

Wait, the quadrilateral is A, B, C, D. So the sides would be AB, BC, CD, DA. But the diagonals would be AC and BD. However, according to the given, Line(A,C) and Line(A,D) are diagonals. Wait, Line(A,D) is connecting A to D, which would normally be a side if D is adjacent to A. Unless the quadrilateral is ordered such that the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA, making AD a side. But then how can AD be a diagonal? Maybe the order of the quadrilateral isn't sequential? Or perhaps the quadrilateral is self-intersecting? Or maybe there's a mistake in my understanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the diagonals are AC and BD, but the given states that Line(A,C) and Line(A,D) are diagonals. Wait, that can't be unless D is connected to A via a diagonal. Wait, maybe the quadrilateral is actually a kite or some other shape where two diagonals are present. Alternatively, maybe the labeling of the quadrilateral is different. Let me try to sketch mentally.

Let me consider that the quadrilateral has vertices A, B, C, D. Suppose the diagonals are AC and AD. Wait, but AD is a side if the order is A-B-C-D-A. But if AD is a diagonal, then maybe the quadrilateral is arranged differently. Perhaps it's a three-dimensional figure? No, since we're talking about planar geometry here. Maybe the quadrilateral is not convex?

Alternatively, maybe there's a typo in the problem statement? Or perhaps I misread the predicates. Let me check again.

The given includes IsDiagonalOf(Line(A,C), Quadrilateral(A,B,C,D)) and IsDiagonalOf(Line(A,D), Quadrilateral(A,B,C,D)). So both AC and AD are considered diagonals of the quadrilateral. That implies that in the quadrilateral ABCD, the diagonals are AC and AD. But in a standard quadrilateral, there are two diagonals connecting opposite vertices. So if AC is a diagonal, then the other diagonal should be BD. But here, AD is also a diagonal. Therefore, this suggests that the quadrilateral is such that AD is a diagonal. Which would mean that the vertices are connected in a way that A is connected to D as a diagonal. So perhaps the quadrilateral is labeled in a non-consecutive order? Like A connected to B, B to C, C to D, and D back to A? But then AD would be a side, not a diagonal. 

This is confusing. Let me try to think differently. Since AC and AD are both diagonals, that implies that in the quadrilateral ABCD, the diagonals are AC and AD. So, for a quadrilateral, each vertex is connected to two others via edges and one via a diagonal. Wait, but each diagonal connects two non-consecutive vertices. So if AC is a diagonal, then A and C are not consecutive. Similarly, AD being a diagonal would imply that A and D are not consecutive. So the order of the quadrilateral must be such that A is connected to B and D (as sides?), but then AC is a diagonal. Wait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe I need to assign coordinates to the points to visualize.

Let me try coordinate geometry. Let's assume point A is at the origin (0,0). Given that Angle(C,A,D) is a right angle. So at point A, the angle between CA and DA is 90 degrees. That suggests that vectors AC and AD are perpendicular. Also, LengthOf AC is 8, LengthOf AD is 4. So if A is at (0,0), then C could be along the x-axis at (8,0), and D could be along the y-axis at (0,4), since AC and AD are perpendicular. Wait, but then angle at A would be between CA and DA, which would be 90 degrees. That fits.

Now, we have another right angle at D, specifically Angle(D,B,C) is a right angle. So at point D, the angle between DB and DC is 90 degrees. So, considering that D is at (0,4), and assuming previous coordinates, we need to find coordinates for B such that when connected to D and C, forms a right angle at D.

Also, we know that BC is 10 units. Let me try to assign coordinates step by step.

So far:

Point A: (0,0)

Point C: (8,0) since AC = 8

Point D: (0,4) since AD = 4, and perpendicular to AC.

Now, need to find coordinates of B such that:

- Angle at D (between DB and DC) is 90 degrees.

- Length BC = 10.

Additionally, since ABCD is a quadrilateral, and diagonals AC and AD are given. Wait, but in our setup, AD is a side? Because from A(0,0) to D(0,4) is a vertical line, which would be a side if the quadrilateral is A-B-C-D-A. Wait, but then AD is a side, not a diagonal. But the predicate says that AD is a diagonal. This contradiction suggests that my initial assumption about the position of D may be wrong. 

Wait, the problem says that Line(A,C) and Line(A,D) are diagonals of the quadrilateral. So if AC is a diagonal, then A and C are not adjacent. Similarly, AD is a diagonal, so A and D are not adjacent. Therefore, in the quadrilateral ABCD, the order of the vertices must be such that A is connected to B and D (so A is adjacent to B and D), but then the diagonals would be AC and BD. But the problem states that diagonals are AC and AD. So this suggests that AD is a diagonal, implying that A and D are not adjacent. Hence, the order of the quadrilateral must be A-B-C-D-A, but then AD would be a side. So this is conflicting. 

Alternative possibility: The quadrilateral is not convex, or the vertices are ordered differently. For instance, suppose the quadrilateral is A-B-D-C-A. In this case, the sides would be AB, BD, DC, and CA. Then diagonals would be AD and BC. Wait, but the problem states that AC and AD are diagonals. If the quadrilateral is A-B-D-C-A, then the diagonals would be BD and AC. So AC is a diagonal (connecting A to C), and AD would be a side (from A to D). So that doesn't fit. 

Hmm. Maybe the quadr is a self-intersecting quadrilateral, like a bowtie shape. But even then, diagonals are still defined as connecting non-consecutive vertices. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different definition of diagonals. Maybe in this context, diagonals refer to lines connecting non-adjacent vertices regardless of the quadrilateral type. So in a quadrilateral ABCD, the diagonals are AC and BD. However, the problem states that Line(A,C) and Line(A,D) are diagonals. So that would require that A is connected to C (a diagonal) and A is connected to D (another diagonal). Which would mean that D is not adjacent to A, which would require that the order of the quadrilateral is such that A is connected to B and C, and D is connected to B and C? Not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the quadrilateral is degenerate? But that's unlikely. 

Maybe I need to proceed despite the confusion. Let me try to use the given information regardless.

We have right angles at A and B. Let me try to model the coordinates again, ignoring the diagonal issue for now.

Assume A is at (0,0), C is at (8,0), D is at (0,4). Now, we need to find point B such that angle at D (between B and C) is 90 degrees, and BC is 10 units long.

At point D(0,4), the angle between DB and DC is 90 degrees. So vector DC is from D to C: (8-0, 0-4) = (8,-4). Vector DB is from D to B: (x-0, y-4) = (xB, yB - 4). These vectors should be perpendicular, so their dot product is zero.

Dot product: (8)(xB) + (-4)(yB - 4) = 0 → 8xB -4(yB -4) = 0 → 8xB -4yB +16=0 → divide by 4: 2xB - yB +4 = 0 → yB = 2xB +4.

Also, the length BC is 10. Point C is at (8,0), point B is at (xB, yB). So distance BC squared is (xB - 8)^2 + (yB - 0)^2 = 10^2 = 100.

Substituting yB = 2xB +4 into this equation:

(xB - 8)^2 + (2xB +4)^2 = 100

Expand:

(xB² -16xB +64) + (4xB² +16xB +16) = 100

Combine terms:

xB² -16xB +64 +4xB² +16xB +16 = 100

Total xB² terms: 5xB²

Linear terms: -16xB +16xB = 0

Constants: 64+16=80

So 5xB² +80 = 100 → 5xB² = 20 → xB² =4 → xB= ±2.

Therefore, xB can be 2 or -2.

Then yB = 2*(±2)+4 → for xB=2: yB=4+4=8; for xB=-2: yB=-4+4=0.

So possible coordinates for B are (2,8) or (-2,0).

Now, let's check if these make sense with the rest of the problem.

First, check if AD is a diagonal. Earlier, I assumed that AD was a side, but according to the problem, AD is a diagonal. So if AD is a diagonal, then in the quadrilateral, A and D are not adjacent. Which would mean that the quadrilateral's vertices are ordered such that A is connected to B and C, and D is connected to B and C? Or something else. 

But with current coordinates, if we take B as (2,8):

Points are A(0,0), B(2,8), C(8,0), D(0,4). Let's see the connections. If the quadrilateral is A-B-C-D-A, then the sides would be AB, BC, CD, DA. But DA would be from D(0,4) to A(0,0), which is a vertical line segment. But in this case, AD is a side, not a diagonal. However, the problem says AD is a diagonal. So this contradicts. Similarly, if B is (-2,0), then coordinates are A(0,0), B(-2,0), C(8,0), D(0,4). Then DA is still a side. 

Wait, but in this scenario, if AD is supposed to be a diagonal, then perhaps the quadrilateral is not A-B-C-D-A, but a different order. Let's consider that the quadrilateral is A-B-D-C-A. Then the sides would be AB, BD, DC, CA. Diagonals would be AD and BC. But in this case, AD would be a diagonal. So yes! If the quadrilateral is A-B-D-C-A, then the sides are AB, BD, DC, CA. The diagonals would be AD and BC. Which matches the given that AC and AD are diagonals. Wait, but AC is a diagonal here. So AC connects A to C, which are not adjacent in this ordering. Yes. And AD connects A to D, which are not adjacent either. So that works.

So the order of the quadrilateral is A-B-D-C-A. Thus, the sides are AB, BD, DC, and CA. So the perimeter would be AB + BD + DC + CA.

But wait, we need to calculate all sides. We already know AC is 8, AD is 4 (but AD is a diagonal here, not a side). Wait, in this configuration, AD is a diagonal. So the sides are AB, BD, DC, and CA. Wait, CA is a side? Because in the quadrilateral A-B-D-C-A, the last side is CA, connecting C back to A. So CA is a side. But earlier, the problem states that AC is a diagonal. Contradiction again. 

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me re-examine the given predicates. It says that Line(A,C) and Line(A,D) are diagonals of the quadrilateral. So both AC and AD are diagonals. In a quadrilateral, there are two diagonals. So if AC and AD are both diagonals, then that implies that the diagonals are AC and AD. Which would mean that in the quadrilateral, the diagonals are AC and AD, hence the other diagonal would be BD. Wait, but in a quadrilateral, there are only two diagonals. So if AC and AD are both diagonals, that would suggest that the quadrilateral has three diagonals? Which is impossible. So there must be an error in my interpretation.

Alternatively, maybe the problem considers that in a quadrilateral, each pair of non-adjacent vertices defines a diagonal. So in a four-sided figure, there are two diagonals. So if the diagonals are AC and AD, that would mean that A is connected to two non-adjacent vertices, C and D. Which would require that A is connected to C and D, but then those would be diagonals. But in a normal quadrilateral, each vertex is connected to two adjacent vertices. So if A is connected to C and D, then those would be diagonals. But that would mean that the quadrilateral has vertices A, B, C, D, with A connected to C and D. So the sides would be AB, BC, CD, DA? No, because DA would be a side, but AD is a diagonal. 

I think I need to move past this confusion and focus on the given data. Let me list what I know:

- AC = 8, AD = 4, BC = 10.

- Angles at A and B are right angles.

- AC and AD are diagonals of the quadrilateral.

Let me try to think of this as two right triangles joined together. Since angle at A is right, and angle at B is right.

Suppose we have triangle ADC, right-angled at A, with legs AC=8 and AD=4. So triangle ADC has right angle at A, so DC can be found using Pythagoras: DC² = AC² + AD² = 8² +4² = 64 +16=80 → DC=√80=4√5.

Then, angle at B is right angle. So angle DBC is right? Wait, the second right angle is Angle(D,B,C), which means at point B, between D and C. So triangle DBC has a right angle at B. Given that BC=10, and we just found DC=4√5. So in triangle DBC, right-angled at B, with hypotenuse DC=4√5, and leg BC=10. Wait, but this would imply that BD² + BC² = DC² → BD² + 10² = (4√5)^2 → BD² + 100 = 16*5 =80 → BD² = -20, which is impossible. So there's a contradiction here. 

This suggests an error in my assumptions. Where did I go wrong?

Ah! The angle at B is between D and C, i.e., angle DBC is a right angle. So triangle DBC has right angle at B. So BC is one leg, BD is another leg, and DC is hypotenuse. But earlier calculation gives DC=4√5 ≈ 8.94, while BC=10. But 4√5 is approximately 8.94 <10, which would make BD² = DC² - BC² = (80) - 100 = negative. Impossible. So this indicates inconsistency.

Which means my earlier assumption about DC being 4√5 is wrong. How? Because if angle at A is right, and AC=8, AD=4, then DC would be sqrt(AC² + AD²) only if angle at A is between AC and AD. But wait, in reality, if angle at A is between CA and DA, then yes, DC would be the hypotenuse of triangle ADC. But then why does this lead to contradiction with triangle DBC?

Wait, perhaps the figure isn't made up of triangles ADC and DBC sharing DC? Maybe the quadrilateral is not composed of these two triangles? Or maybe the right angle at B is part of a different triangle?

Let me reconsider. Let me think of the entire quadrilateral ABCD. With right angles at A and B. Let me try to find coordinates again, but more carefully.

Let me place point A at (0,0). Since angle at A is right between CA and DA, let me set C along x-axis and D along y-axis. So C=(8,0), D=(0,4). Now, point B needs to satisfy the right angle at B between D and C, i.e., angle DBC is right. So B lies somewhere such that when connected to D and C, forms a right angle at B.

So, point B lies on the circle with diameter DC? Wait, no. For angle DBC to be right, point B lies on the circle with diameter DC. Because in a circle, an angle subtended by a diameter is a right angle. So DC is the diameter of the circle, and B lies on it. 

Coordinates of D are (0,4), C are (8,0). Midpoint of DC is ((0+8)/2, (4+0)/2) = (4,2). The radius is half of DC: DC length is sqrt((8-0)^2 + (0-4)^2) = sqrt(64+16)=sqrt(80)=4√5. So radius is 2√5. Equation of the circle: (x-4)^2 + (y-2)^2 = (2√5)^2 = 20.

Point B lies on this circle. Additionally, BC=10. Let's compute BC distance. Coordinates of C=(8,0), B=(x,y). Distance BC is sqrt((x-8)^2 + (y-0)^2) = 10. Squared: (x-8)^2 + y² = 100.

But also, (x-4)^2 + (y-2)^2 = 20.

Expanding the circle equation:

(x² -8x +16) + (y² -4y +4) =20 → x² + y² -8x -4y +20 =20 → x² + y² -8x -4y =0.

From the BC distance equation: (x-8)^2 + y² = 100 → x² -16x +64 + y² =100 → x² + y² -16x = 36.

Now, subtract the circle equation from this:

(x² + y² -16x) - (x² + y² -8x -4y) = 36 -0 → -16x - (-8x -4y) =36 → -16x +8x +4y =36 → -8x +4y =36 → Divide by 4: -2x + y =9 → y=2x +9.

Now substitute y=2x+9 into the circle equation:

(x-4)^2 + (y-2)^2 =20 → (x-4)^2 + (2x+9 -2)^2 =20 → (x-4)^2 + (2x+7)^2 =20.

Expand:

(x² -8x +16) + (4x² +28x +49) =20 → x² -8x +16 +4x² +28x +49 = 20 → 5x² +20x +65 =20 → 5x² +20x +45 =0 → Divide by 5: x² +4x +9 =0.

Discriminant: 16 - 36 = -20 <0. No real solutions. What? That means there is no such point B on the circle satisfying BC=10. Which is a contradiction. 

This suggests that there is no such point B, which can't be true. So where is the mistake here?

Earlier, I assumed that angle DBC being right implies that B lies on the circle with diameter DC. But maybe that's not the case? Or perhaps my coordinate system is wrong. Let me double-check.

For angle DBC to be a right angle, the locus of point B is indeed the circle with diameter DC. So if there's no solution, it suggests inconsistency in given lengths. But the problem states that all these conditions hold, so I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the equations. Let me recheck.

Starting over: 

Circle equation: (x-4)^2 + (y-2)^2 =20.

BC distance squared: (x-8)^2 + y² =100.

Expand both:

Circle: x² -8x +16 + y² -4y +4 =20 → x² + y² -8x -4y +20 =20 → x² + y² -8x -4y =0.

BC: x² -16x +64 + y² =100 → x² + y² -16x =36.

Subtract circle equation from BC equation:

(x² + y² -16x) - (x² + y² -8x -4y) =36 -0 → -16x +8x +4y =36 → -8x +4y =36 → simplify: -2x + y =9 → y=2x +9. Correct.

Substitute into circle equation:

(x-4)^2 + (2x+9 -2)^2 =20 → (x-4)^2 + (2x+7)^2 =20.

Calculate:

(x² -8x +16) + (4x² +28x +49) = x² +4x² =5x²; -8x +28x=20x; 16+49=65. So total: 5x² +20x +65 =20 → 5x² +20x +45=0 → x² +4x +9=0. Discriminant: 16 -36 = -20. No solution. 

This suggests that with the given lengths, it's impossible. But the problem states that all these conditions are true, so I must have made an incorrect assumption in setting up the coordinates.

Perhaps the right angle at A is not between CA and DA, but between other segments? Wait, the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(C, A, D)), which means the angle at A between points C and D. So it's ∠CAD, which is the angle at A between CA and DA. So my original setup is correct.

Another possibility: The angle at B is not between D and C, but between other points? Wait, the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(D, B, C)), which means the angle at B between D and C, i.e., ∠DBC. So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the diagram is three-dimensional? Unlikely, as we're dealing with plane geometry.

Wait, perhaps the length BC is not directly from B to C, but something else? No, BC is a line segment between B and C.

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in the length of DC? Let me check. If AC=8, AD=4, and angle at A is right, then DC should be sqrt(8² +4²) = sqrt(80). But if DC is sqrt(80), and BC=10, then in triangle DBC, right-angled at B, we have DC² = BC² + BD² → 80 = 100 + BD² → BD² = -20. Still impossible.

This suggests that the given data is inconsistent, but the problem states that it is solvable. So where is the error?

Wait, maybe the right angles are not in the way I thought. Let me re-examine the predicates.

RightAngle(Angle(C, A, D)): This is the angle at A, between C and D, so ∠DAC is a right angle.

RightAngle(Angle(D, B, C)): This is the angle at B, between D and C, so ∠DBC is a right angle.

So, if I have triangle DAC with right angle at A, and triangle DBC with right angle at B. But how do these triangles relate?

Maybe the quadrilateral is made up of triangles DAC and ABC? Or some combination?

Alternatively, perhaps ABCD is formed by having right angles at A and B, with AC and AD as diagonals. Let me think of ABCD as follows: Points A and C are connected by diagonal AC, and points A and D are connected by diagonal AD. So, the quadrilateral has diagonals AC and AD, and sides AB, BC, CD, DA. Wait, but then DA would be a side, not a diagonal. So this is contradictory.

Alternatively, perhaps the diagonals are AC and BD, and the problem mistakenly refers to AD as a diagonal? But the problem says both AC and AD are diagonals.

At this point, I'm stuck. Let me try to look for alternative approaches.

Since the problem asks for the perimeter, maybe we don't need to find all sides explicitly. Let's think: perimeter of quadrilateral ABCD is AB + BC + CD + DA.

We know BC=10, DA=4 (given), AC=8. But we need AB, CD.

If we can find AB and CD, we can add them all.

From earlier, in triangle ADC, right-angled at A, AC=8, AD=4, so DC= sqrt(8² +4²)=sqrt(80)=4√5.

So CD=4√5.

Now, we need AB. To find AB, perhaps we can find coordinates of B.

But earlier attempts led to contradictions. Let me try again.

Assume A(0,0), C(8,0), D(0,4). Need to find B such that angle at B (∠DBC) is right, and BC=10.

Let me parameterize point B. Let me denote B as (x,y). Then, since ∠DBC is right, the vectors BD and BC are perpendicular.

Vector BD = D - B = (0-x, 4-y) = (-x, 4-y).

Vector BC = C - B = (8-x, 0-y) = (8-x, -y).

Their dot product should be zero:

(-x)(8-x) + (4-y)(-y) = 0.

Expand:

-8x + x² -4y + y² = 0 → x² -8x + y² -4y = 0.

Also, BC has length 10, so (8-x)^2 + (0 - y)^2 = 100 → (8-x)^2 + y² = 100.

Expand: x² -16x +64 + y² = 100 → x² + y² -16x = 36.

Now, from the dot product equation: x² + y² -8x -4y = 0.

Let me call the first equation (dot product): E1: x² + y² -8x -4y = 0.

Second equation (BC length): E2: x² + y² -16x = 36.

Subtract E1 from E2:

(E2) - (E1): (x² + y² -16x) - (x² + y² -8x -4y) = 36 - 0 → -16x +8x +4y =36 → -8x +4y =36 → Simplify: -2x + y =9 → y=2x +9.

Substitute y=2x+9 into E1: x² + (2x+9)^2 -8x -4*(2x+9) =0.

Compute:

x² +4x² +36x +81 -8x -8x -36 =0 → 5x² + (36x -8x -8x) + (81-36) =0 → 5x² +20x +45 =0 → x² +4x +9=0, same as before. Discriminant is 16-36=-20. No real solution. 

This suggests that under the given conditions, there is no such point B. But the problem exists, so there must be an error in my assumptions. 

Wait, perhaps the angle at B is not ∠DBC, but ∠ABD or something else? Let me recheck the predicate: RightAngle(Angle(D, B, C)) means the angle at B between D and C, so it's ∠DBC. So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the right angle at B is between other segments? For example, if the angle is between B, D, and C, but in a different order? Like ∠CBD? No, the notation Angle(D, B, C) means the angle at B between D and C.

At this point, I'm forced to conclude that there's a mistake in the problem, or I've missed something. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the quadrilateral is not simple, or the diagonals overlap?

Alternatively, perhaps the length BC is not from B to C, but from B to another point? No, the predicate says LengthOf(Line(B, C)) is 10.

Wait, perhaps the figure is not a convex quadrilateral, and the right angle at B is inside the quadrilateral? Even so, the calculation should still hold.

Alternatively, maybe the length BC is not straight? No, it's a line segment.

Wait, what if the right angle at B is not in the triangle DBC, but in another triangle? For example, if AB is perpendicular to BC? Let me consider that.

If angle at B is between A and C, i.e., ∠ABC is right. But the predicate says Angle(D, B, C), which is ∠DBC. So that's different.

Wait, maybe I mixed up the angle at B. Let me confirm: Angle(D, B, C) is the angle at B between D and C, so it's ∠DBC. So the angle between BD and BC at point B.

Given that, and the earlier calculations leading to no solution, perhaps the given lengths are incorrect? Or maybe I need to revisit the assumption that AC and AD are diagonals.

Wait, if AC and AD are diagonals, then in the quadrilateral, AC and AD are both diagonals. This would imply that the quadrilateral has three diagonals, which is impossible. Hence, the only way this can happen is if one of the diagonals is counted twice, or if the quadrilateral is degenerate.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that AC and BD are diagonals, and there was a typo? Let me assume that for a moment. If AC and BD are diagonals, then with the given data, let's see.

Assuming AC and BD are diagonals. Then, with AC=8, AD=4, BC=10.

In this case, if AC is a diagonal, and AD is a side, then let's proceed.

With A(0,0), C(8,0), D(0,4). Now, need to find B such that BD is a diagonal, and BC=10, with right angle at B.

But this is getting too speculative. Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Let me recall that the perimeter is AB + BC + CD + DA. We know BC=10, DA=4, CD=4√5. Need AB.

If I can find AB, then perimeter is AB +10 +4√5 +4. But without knowing AB, this is difficult.

Alternatively, maybe AB can be found using the right angle at A and B.

Wait, if there's a right angle at A, and another at B, perhaps there are two right triangles: one at A and one at B.

Let me imagine that. At point A, right angle between AC and AD, forming triangle ADC. At point B, right angle between some segments.

But without knowing the relationship between B and the other points, it's hard to say.

Wait, if I consider the quadrilateral ABCD with diagonals AC and AD, and right angles at A and B. Maybe it's a rectangle or something, but with diagonals?

No, because in a rectangle, diagonals are equal, but here AC=8 and AD=4, which are different.

Alternatively, it's a kite? In a kite, one diagonal is the axis of symmetry. But with diagonals AC and AD, it's unclear.

Alternatively, think of it as two right triangles sharing a common side.

If AC and AD are diagonals, and there's a right angle at A, then triangle ADC is right-angled at A. If there's a right angle at B, perhaps triangle ABD or something else.

But without more info, it's challenging.

Wait, let's try to assume that AB is perpendicular to AD. Since there's a right angle at A, but that's already covered by the right angle between AC and AD. So AB could be along AD or something else.

Wait, if AB is perpendicular to AD, then AB would be horizontal if AD is vertical. But AD is from A(0,0) to D(0,4), which is vertical. So AB would be horizontal, along x-axis. But then point B would be somewhere on the x-axis. Let's say B is at (x,0). Then, BC would be from B(x,0) to C(8,0), which would make BC length |8 - x|. Given BC=10, this would give |8 -x|=10 → x= -2 or 18. 

If x=-2, then B is at (-2,0). Now, check if angle at B is right. The angle at B is ∠DBC, which is the angle at B between D(0,4) and C(8,0). Let's compute this angle.

Vectors BD and BC. 

Point B(-2,0), D(0,4), C(8,0).

Vector BD = D - B = (0 - (-2), 4 - 0) = (2,4).

Vector BC = C - B = (8 - (-2), 0 - 0) = (10,0).

Dot product of BD and BC: 2*10 +4*0 =20 ≠ 0. So not perpendicular. Hence, angle at B is not right. 

If x=18, then B is at (18,0). Vector BD = (0-18, 4-0)=(-18,4). Vector BC = (8-18, 0-0)=(-10,0). Dot product: (-18)*(-10) +4*0 =180 ≠0. Not perpendicular. So this doesn't work.

Thus, assuming AB is along x-axis doesn't help.

Another idea: Maybe AB is perpendicular to BC? Since there's a right angle at B. If ∠ABC is right, then AB ⊥ BC. Let's explore this.

Assume ∠ABC is right. So AB ⊥ BC. Let me try to find coordinates.

Let me take point B(x,y). Since ∠ABC is right, then AB · BC =0.

Vector AB = (x-0, y-0) = (x, y).

Vector BC = (8 - x, 0 - y) = (8-x, -y).

Their dot product: x(8-x) + y*(-y) =8x -x² -y² =0 → x² + y² =8x.

Also, BC length is 10: (8-x)^2 + (0-y)^2 =100 → x² -16x +64 + y² =100 → x² + y² -16x =36.

From above, x² + y² =8x. Substitute into the BC equation:

8x -16x =36 → -8x=36 → x=-4.5.

Then x=-4.5. From x² + y² =8x: (-4.5)^2 + y² =8*(-4.5) → 20.25 + y² = -36 → y² = -56.25. Impossible. So no solution.

This suggests that assuming ∠ABC is right leads to contradiction. 

At this point, I'm really stuck. Perhaps the problem has a typo, or I'm missing a key insight. Let me try to think outside the box.

What if the quadrilateral is a trapezoid? With right angles at A and B. For example, a right trapezoid with bases AD and BC, and legs AB and CD. But in that case, AD and BC would be parallel. But given AD=4, BC=10, which are different lengths. Let me try.

In a right trapezoid, two adjacent right angles. Assume AD and BC are the two bases, and AB and CD are the legs. With right angles at A and B.

So, AD is vertical, BC is horizontal? Or vice versa? Let me set A(0,0), D(0,4) (since AD=4). Since it's a trapezoid, BC is parallel to AD. So BC is vertical. But BC has length 10, so if B is at (x, y), then C would be at (x, y+10) or something? Wait, this is getting too vague.

Alternatively, if AD and BC are the two bases, and AB and CD are the legs. With right angles at A and B, so AB is perpendicular to AD and BC.

Let me try coordinates: A(0,0), D(0,4) (AD=4). Since it's a trapezoid with AD || BC, and right angles at A and B.

So AB is perpendicular to AD, so AB is horizontal. Let me say AB is from A(0,0) to B(a,0), so AB length is a. Then BC is parallel to AD, which is vertical. So BC is vertical. Since B is at (a,0), and BC is vertical, then C is at (a, b), and since BC length is 10, then the vertical distance from B to C is 10, so b -0 =10 → b=10. So C is at (a,10). 

Now, since AD is from A(0,0) to D(0,4), and DC is from D(0,4) to C(a,10). The length AC is given as 8. Let's compute AC: from A(0,0) to C(a,10). Length AC = sqrt(a² + 10²) = sqrt(a² +100) =8 → a² +100 =64 → a² = -36. Impossible. 

Again, contradiction. 

This suggests that the trapezoid assumption is invalid.

At this point, I'm running out of ideas. Let me try to think about the perimeter. The options are 22, 32, 40, 42. Let me see if I can guess based on possible values.

We know BC=10, DA=4, CD=4√5 ≈8.94. If I assume that AB is 6, then perimeter would be 6+10+8.94+4≈28.94, which is not among the options. If AB is 8, perimeter ≈8+10+8.94+4=30.94. Still not matching. If AB is 10, perimeter ≈10+10+8.94+4=32.94, close to option B (32). Maybe the exact value is 32.

But how? Let me think: if CD is 4√5, which is approximately 8.94, and DA=4, BC=10, then if AB is 10, perimeter is 10+10+8.94+4=32.94. Close to 32. But how to get exact value?

Wait, maybe CD is not 4√5? What if I made a mistake in calculating CD?

Wait, if angle at A is right, and AC=8, AD=4, then DC is hypotenuse of right triangle ADC, so DC=√(8² +4²)=√80=4√5. Correct. So CD=4√5.

If I assume that AB is 10, then perimeter is 10 +10 +4√5 +4 =24 +4√5. But 4√5 is about 8.94, so total is about 32.94. The closest option is B (32). But this is an approximation. However, the problem might expect us to use integer values, suggesting that perhaps my assumption about CD is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the right angle at A is not between AC and AD, but between other segments? For example, if the angle at A is between AB and AD, making AB perpendicular to AD. Then, AC is a diagonal, and AD is a side. Let me try this.

Let me assume that at point A, the right angle is between AB and AD, so AB ⊥ AD. Let me set A at (0,0), AD along y-axis to D(0,4), and AB along x-axis to B(b,0). Then, AC is a diagonal from A(0,0) to C. Since AC=8, C is somewhere such that its distance from A is 8. Let me say C is at (8,0), but then AC would be along x-axis. But then D is at (0,4), and B is at (b,0). Now, need to satisfy the right angle at B between D and C.

So angle at B between D and C is right. So vectors BD and BC are perpendicular.

Point B(b,0), D(0,4), C(8,0). Vector BD = (0-b, 4-0) = (-b,4). Vector BC = (8-b, 0-0) = (8-b, 0). Their dot product: (-b)(8-b) + 4*0 = -8b +b² =0 → b² -8b =0 → b(b-8)=0 → b=0 or b=8. 

b=0 would put B at A, which is invalid. b=8 puts B at (8,0), which is same as C. Also invalid. So no solution. 

Thus, this approach fails.

Finally, perhaps the problem involves a square or other regular figure, but with given lengths. For example, if AC=8, AD=4, and BC=10, it's hard to see.

Wait, let me try to calculate the perimeter using the given data, even if there's inconsistency. 

Perimeter = AB + BC + CD + DA = AB +10 +4√5 +4 = AB +14 +4√5.

If I assume that AB is 6, then perimeter is 6 +14 +8.94 =38.94, which is not in options. If AB is 8, perimeter is 8+14+8.94=30.94. If AB is 10, 10+14+8.94=32.94, close to 32. If AB is
