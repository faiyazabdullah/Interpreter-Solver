Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have some arc measures and angles given, and we need to find the measure of arc CF. Let me start by recalling the given information:

- Measure of arc FE is 118 degrees.
- Measure of arc AB is 108 degrees.
- Measure of angle EGB is 52 degrees.
- Measure of angle EFB is 30 degrees.

We need to find the measure of arc CF. Hmm, first, I should probably sketch a diagram based on these arcs and angles. Since there are points like F, E, A, B, G, and C mentioned, it's likely involving circles and intersecting chords or secants. 

Let me think about the circle theorems that relate angles and arcs. For instance, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Also, if two chords intersect inside a circle, the measure of the angle formed is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. Similarly, if two secants intersect outside the circle, the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs.

Wait, but here we have angles like EGB and EFB. Let me consider where these points are located. Maybe point G is outside the circle? Or maybe inside? Let me try to visualize.

Assuming that all points lie on a single circle, since they mention arcs. Let me note that arc FE is 118°, so points F and E are on the circumference. Arc AB is 108°, so points A and B are also on the circumference. Points G and B might be connected via some chords or secants. Angle EGB is 52°, which could be an inscribed angle or an angle formed by two chords. Similarly, angle EFB is 30°, which might be an inscribed angle intercepting arc EB or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps there are two intersecting chords creating those angles. For example, angle EGB being formed by chords EG and BG, and angle EFB formed by chords EF and BF.

But without seeing the diagram, I need to make assumptions. Let me try to proceed step by step.

First, considering angle EFB = 30°. If this is an inscribed angle, then it would intercept an arc. Let's assume that angle at F intercepts arc EB. Wait, but the vertex is at F, so the angle would intercept arc EB. Therefore, measure of arc EB would be twice the angle, so 60°. But wait, the given arc FE is 118°, so if arc EB is 60°, then arc BE would be part of the circle. However, arc FE is 118°, so maybe arc FB is something else?

Alternatively, if angle EFB is formed by two chords, like FE and FB. Then, the measure of angle EFB would be half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Wait, that applies when the angle is formed by two secants, tangents, or a secant and a tangent. If point F is on the circle, then the angle at F would be an inscribed angle intercepting arc EB. Wait, but if F is on the circle, then angle EFB would intercept arc EB. Therefore, measure of arc EB would be 2*30=60°. So arc EB is 60°.

But arc FE is given as 118°, so if arc FE is adjacent to arc EB, then total arc from E to B through F would be arc FE + arc EB? Wait, depending on the position of points. Suppose points E and B are such that moving from E to F to B along the circumference. Then arc EF is 118°, arc FB would be... Well, if angle EFB intercepts arc EB, which we said is 60°, then maybe arc EB is 60°, which would mean that arc EF plus arc FB equals arc EB? No, that doesn't make sense unless the points are arranged differently. Alternatively, maybe arc EB is opposite to angle EFB.

Wait, perhaps I need to recall that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So if angle EFB is an inscribed angle, then it intercepts arc EB. Therefore, arc EB = 2*angle EFB = 60°. That seems straightforward.

Now, arc FE is given as 118°, so if we can relate arc FE with other arcs. Let me think about the entire circle. The total circumference is 360°, so sum of all arcs should add up to 360°. But we don't know all arcs yet.

Also, given arc AB is 108°, so points A and B are separated by 108°. Now, we need to find arc CF. So point C must be somewhere on the circle. But how does point C come into play?

Perhaps there are more points involved. Let me try to map out the points. We have points F, E, A, B, G, and C. Assuming they are all on the same circle. Let me try to imagine the circle with points E, F, A, B, and others. 

Given that arc FE is 118°, and arc AB is 108°, and angle EGB is 52°, and angle EFB is 30°. Maybe points G and C are related to other parts of the circle.

Another thing to consider: angle EGB is 52°, which might be an angle formed by two chords intersecting at G. If G is inside the circle, then the measure of angle EGB would be half the sum of the intercepted arcs. For example, if angle EGB intercepts arcs EB and another arc. Wait, suppose G is the intersection of two chords, say EG and BG. Then angle EGB would be half the sum of the arcs intercepted by those chords. The formula is: measure of angle = ½ (arc EB + arc FA), assuming that the angle is formed by two chords intersecting at G. Wait, but without knowing where G is, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, if G is outside the circle, then angle EGB would be half the difference of the intercepted arcs. For example, if two secants from G intercept arcs, then angle EGB = ½ (arc EB - arc FA). But again, without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging.

But maybe we can use the given angles and arcs to set up equations. Let me try to work with what I have.

Earlier, I found that arc EB is 60° because angle EFB is 30°, which is an inscribed angle. So arc EB = 60°. Given arc FE is 118°, so if we can find arc FB, maybe? Because arc FE + arc EB would be arc from F to B passing through E? Not sure. Wait, if points F, E, and B are on the circle, then arc FE is 118°, arc EB is 60°, then arc FB would depend on whether E is between F and B or not. If the points are ordered as F-E-B, then arc FB would be arc FE + arc EB = 118 + 60 = 178°, but that's just one possibility. Alternatively, if the points are arranged differently.

But maybe we can find other arcs. For instance, arc AB is 108°, so points A and B are separated by that arc. Let me try to see if there's a way to connect arc AB with other arcs.

Also, angle EGB is 52°, which might involve arcs that include AB or other arcs. Let me think. If G is inside the circle, then angle EGB is formed by two chords, so the measure is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. Suppose angle EGB intercepts arcs EA and FB. Then, measure of angle EGB would be ½(arc EA + arc FB) = 52°, so arc EA + arc FB = 104°. But I don't know arc EA or arc FB yet.

Alternatively, if angle EGB intercepts arcs EB and something else. Wait, maybe I need to consider where point G is. If G is the intersection of chords EB and something else? Or maybe GB is a chord connecting to point B, and GE connects to point E. So if G is inside the circle, then angle EGB would be half the sum of arcs intercepted by EB and the other arc. Wait, when two chords intersect inside a circle, the measure of the angle is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. So if chords EB and FG intersect at G, then angle EGB would be ½(arc EB + arc FG). But without knowing which arcs are intercepted, it's tricky.

Alternatively, maybe point G lies on another chord, like GA or GC. This is getting complicated without the diagram. Perhaps I need to look for other relations.

We also have arc AB = 108°, so if we can find other arcs that relate to AB, that might help. Let me consider that arc AB is 108°, and maybe arc CF is connected to it somehow. The goal is to find arc CF, so perhaps there's a relationship between arc CF and other arcs through angles or other theorems.

Let me recap what I have so far:

Arc FE = 118°, arc EB = 60° (from angle EFB = 30°). Arc AB = 108°. Need to find arc CF.

Maybe I need to find other arcs. Let me check if there are overlapping arcs or if I can express arc CF in terms of other arcs.

Suppose that the entire circle is divided into several arcs. Let's denote the arcs as follows:

Arc FE = 118°, arc EB = 60°, arc BA = 108°, and then arcs BC, CD, DE, etc., but since I don't have info on all points, maybe there's a different approach.

Alternatively, since angle EGB is 52°, and if that angle relates to arcs that include AB or other arcs. Let's suppose that angle EGB is formed by two chords, say, GE and GB. If G is inside the circle, then angle EGB = ½(arc EB + arc FA). Wait, arc FA would be the arc opposite to the angle. Wait, the formula is that the measure of the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. So if two chords intersect at G, then the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. For example, if chords EB and FA intersect at G, then angle EGB = ½(arc EA + arc FB).

So, angle EGB = 52° = ½(arc EA + arc FB). Therefore, arc EA + arc FB = 104°.

But I don't know arc EA or arc FB individually. However, maybe I can find expressions for them.

Earlier, arc FE is 118°, which is from F to E. If we can find arc EA, then maybe we can combine with other arcs.

Alternatively, let's think about the entire circle. The total circumference is 360°, so the sum of all arcs should be 360°. Let me try to list arcs that we know or can express.

Known arcs:

Arc FE = 118°, arc EB = 60°, arc AB = 108°.

So, starting from point F, going through E to B, then to A, then... ?

If we go from F to E (118°), then from E to B (60°), making arc FB = arc FE + arc EB = 118 + 60 = 178°, assuming that E is between F and B. Then from B to A is 108°, so arc BA = 108°. So, if we can continue around the circle, but we don't know the rest.

But where is point C? It's supposed to be part of arc CF, which we need to find. So maybe point C is somewhere on the circle, possibly connected to other arcs.

Alternatively, maybe arc CF is part of the remaining arcs. Let me think. Suppose that the entire circle is made up of arcs FE (118°), EB (60°), BA (108°), and then arc AC, arc CF, and maybe other arcs. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's still unclear.

Alternatively, maybe there's a relation between arc CF and angle EGB. Since angle EGB is 52°, which we earlier thought was ½(arc EA + arc FB) = 52°, leading to arc EA + arc FB = 104°. If I can find arc FB, then I can find arc EA.

From before, arc FB is arc FE + arc EB = 118 + 60 = 178°, assuming points F, E, B are in order. Then arc EA + 178° = 104° → arc EA = 104 - 178 = negative number, which is impossible. So my assumption must be wrong.

Therefore, maybe arc FB isn't the sum of arc FE and arc EB. That suggests that points F, E, B are not in the order I assumed. Maybe the arc from F to B is not passing through E. Instead, perhaps E is on a different side. Let me reconsider.

If arc FE is 118°, and arc EB is 60°, then depending on the direction of traversal, the arcs could overlap or be separate. Wait, but arc FE and arc EB would share point E. So if we're talking about arcs FE and EB, they meet at E. So the arc from F to B passing through E would be arc FE + arc EB = 118 + 60 = 178°, as before. But then arc FB would be 178°, which led us to an inconsistency.

So perhaps arc FB is not 178°, but instead, arc FB is something else. Maybe arc FB is the minor arc, while arc FE and arc EB are major arcs? Wait, but arc FE is given as 118°, which is less than 180°, so it's a minor arc. Similarly, arc EB is 60°, also minor. So combining them gives a larger arc. But if arc FB is the major arc, then it would be 360 - minor arc FB. But I'm confused.

Alternatively, maybe arc FB is the other arc, i.e., the arc that doesn't pass through E. In that case, arc FB would be the rest of the circle minus arc FE and arc EB. Wait, but without knowing the total, it's hard to calculate.

Wait, let me think again. If angle EFB = 30°, then as an inscribed angle, it intercepts arc EB. So arc EB = 60°, which is fixed. Then, if arc FE is 118°, and arc EB is 60°, then the arc from F to B passing through E is 178°, and the arc from F to B not passing through E is 360 - 178 = 182°, but that's a major arc. But I don't know if that helps directly.

Back to the equation from angle EGB = 52°, which was ½(arc EA + arc FB) = 52°, leading to arc EA + arc FB = 104°. If I can find arc FB, then I can find arc EA. How?

Well, arc FB could be either the minor or major arc. But if we assume that arc FB is the minor arc, then it's something we need to find. However, we don't have direct information about arc FB. Unless there's another way to find it.

Alternatively, maybe arc FB can be expressed in terms of other arcs. For example, if we consider that arc FE is 118°, and arc EB is 60°, then if the points are arranged as F-E-B, arc FB is 118+60=178°, which would be a major arc. But if we take the minor arc FB, then it would be 360 - 178 = 182°, which is even larger. That doesn't seem helpful.

This suggests that my initial assumption about the intercepted arcs for angle EGB might be incorrect. Maybe angle EGB intercepts different arcs. Let me revisit that.

Angle EGB is formed at point G. If G is outside the circle, then the measure of angle EGB would be half the difference of the intercepted arcs. For example, if two secants from G intercept arcs EB and AF, then angle EGB = ½(arc EB - arc AF). So, 52° = ½(arc EB - arc AF), leading to arc EB - arc AF = 104°. Since arc EB is 60°, then arc AF = 60° - 104° = -44°, which is impossible. Hence, that's not possible. So maybe angle EGB intercepts arcs EB and something else.

Alternatively, if angle EGB is formed by two secants that intercept arcs EA and FB. So angle EGB = ½(arc EA - arc FB). Then, 52 = ½(arc EA - arc FB), so arc EA - arc FB = 104. But again, without knowing arc FB or arc EA, it's difficult.

Alternatively, maybe angle EGB is formed by a secant and a tangent, but we don't have info about tangents. Without more information, it's hard to tell.

Hmm, this seems stuck. Maybe I need to consider another angle. Let's think about angle EFB = 30° again. Earlier, I considered it as an inscribed angle intercepting arc EB. But what if point F is not on the circle? Wait, no, because arc FE and arc AB are given, implying that points F, E, A, B are on the circle. So point F is on the circle.

Thus, angle EFB is an inscribed angle, intercepting arc EB. So arc EB = 60°, as before.

Now, if I consider the entire circle, let's try to sum up the arcs we know. Let's assume the circle has arcs FE (118°), EB (60°), BA (108°). What about the rest of the circle? The remaining arcs would be from A back to F, passing through C and other points. But we need to find arc CF.

Wait, maybe there's a way to relate arc CF with other arcs through the angles given. Let me think about the other angle, angle EGB = 52°. If I can express arc EA or arc FB in terms of known arcs.

Let me consider that arc EA + arc FB = 104° from earlier (assuming angle EGB intercepts arcs EA and FB). If I can find arc FB, then I can find arc EA.

But how to find arc FB?

Arc FB can be determined if we know the arcs between F and B. If arc FE is 118°, and arc EB is 60°, then if points F, E, B are in order, arc FB is 118 + 60 = 178°, but that's a major arc. The minor arc FB would be 360 - 178 = 182°, which is still a major arc. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Minor arcs are less than 180°, so maybe arc FB is actually 180 - 178 = 2°? No, that can't be. I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the arc from F to B is not passing through E. If arc FE is 118°, then from F to E is 118°, and arc EB is 60°, so if we go from F to B through E, that's 178°, but if we go the other way around the circle, it would be 360 - 178 = 182°, which is still a major arc. So arc FB is ambiguous unless specified.

But maybe there's another approach. Let me consider that arc AB is 108°, so from A to B is 108°. If I can find arc AF, then I can relate it to arc FB.

Alternatively, if there's a relationship between arc CF and other arcs. Let me think about the fact that we need to find arc CF. Perhaps there's an inscribed angle that intercepts arc CF, which we can relate to known angles.

For example, if there's an angle that intercepts arc CF, and we can find its measure from other given angles.

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle or quadrilateral involving point C that we can analyze.

Wait, I'm not making progress here. Let me try to summarize what I know:

1. arc FE = 118°
2. arc EB = 60° (from angle EFB = 30°)
3. arc AB = 108°
4. angle EGB = 52°
5. angle EFB = 30°

Need to find arc CF.

Let me try to assume that points are arranged in the order F, E, B, A, C, and back to F. Let me attempt to compute the arcs step by step.

Starting from F, moving clockwise:

- arc FE = 118°
- From E to B: arc EB = 60°
- From B to A: arc BA = 108°
- From A to C: let's call this arc AC = x
- From C to F: arc CF = y

Total circle: 118 + 60 + 108 + x + y = 360

So, 118 + 60 = 178; 178 + 108 = 286. Thus, x + y = 360 - 286 = 74°.

So, arc AC + arc CF = 74°. But we need to find arc CF, which is y. So if I can find x, then y = 74 - x.

How can I find x or y?

Looking back at angle EGB = 52°. If this angle is formed by intersecting chords, then maybe it relates to arcs that include AC or other arcs.

Assume that angle EGB is formed by chords GE and GB, which intersect at G. If G is inside the circle, then angle EGB = ½(sum of intercepted arcs). Which arcs are intercepted? If the angle is at G, formed by GE and GB, then the intercepted arcs would be arc EB and arc FA (the arcs opposite to the angle). So, angle EGB = ½(arc EB + arc FA).

We have arc EB = 60°, and arc FA is the arc from F to A. Let's see, arc FA would be arc FE + arc EB + arc BA? No, that depends on the order of points. If points are F, E, B, A, then arc FA would be arc FE + arc EB + arc BA = 118 + 60 + 108 = 286°, which is more than 180°, so it's the major arc. But angle EGB is 52°, so:

52 = ½(arc EB + arc FA)

So, arc EB + arc FA = 104°.

We already have arc EB = 60°, so arc FA = 104 - 60 = 44°.

But arc FA is the arc from F to A. Depending on the direction, arc FA could be the minor arc or major arc. But since arc FA = 44°, which is less than 180°, it must be the minor arc. So, arc FA = 44°.

But how does this relate to our previous variables?

Arc FA is from F to A. If the points are arranged as F, E, B, A, then arc FA would be the arc going from F to A through E and B, which we previously calculated as 118 + 60 + 108 = 286°, which contradicts arc FA being 44°. So there's a contradiction here, suggesting my assumption about the arrangement of points is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe arc FA is the minor arc, which is 44°, meaning that the points are arranged such that from F to A is 44°, not going through E and B. So, perhaps the circle is divided into arcs FE (118°), arc EA (which would be part of the 44°?), arc AB (108°), and others.

Wait, if arc FA is 44°, then from F to A is 44°, which could mean that arc FE + arc EA = 44°, but arc FE is 118°, which would imply arc EA = 44 - 118 = -74°, which is impossible. So this can't be.

This suggests that my assumption about which arcs are intercepted by angle EGB is incorrect. Maybe angle EGB intercepts different arcs. Let me think again.

If G is outside the circle, then angle EGB = ½(difference of intercepted arcs). So, if two secants from G intercept arcs EB and AF, then angle EGB = ½(arc EB - arc AF). So, 52 = ½(60 - arc AF), which gives 60 - arc AF = 104 => arc AF = 60 - 104 = -44°, which is invalid. So that can't be.

Alternatively, if the angle is formed by a secant and a tangent, but we don't have info about tangents. Or maybe the intercepted arcs are EB and CF? Let me try that. If angle EGB intercepts arc EB and arc CF, then angle EGB = ½(arc EB - arc CF). So 52 = ½(60 - arc CF), leading to 60 - arc CF = 104 => arc CF = 60 - 104 = -44°, still impossible.

Hmm, this isn't working. Maybe angle EGB intercepts arc EB and arc something else. Let me try another approach.

Since I'm stuck, maybe I should focus on finding arc CF using other means. Let me recall that arc CF is what we need to find, and we have arc FA = 44° (from earlier, though that led to contradictions). If arc FA is 44°, then perhaps arc CF is part of that.

Wait, if arc FA is 44°, and arc FE is 118°, then if points are arranged as F, C, A, then arc FC + arc CA = arc FA = 44°. So, arc CF + arc CA = 44°. But without knowing arc CA, I can't find arc CF.

Alternatively, if arc FA is 44°, and arc FE is 118°, then maybe arc FC is part of arc FA. For example, if point C is between F and A, then arc FC + arc CA = arc FA = 44°. But again, without knowing arc CA, I can't find arc CF.

But earlier, we had from the total circle: arc AC + arc CF = 74°, if the points were arranged as F, E, B, A, C. But if arc FA is 44°, then arc AC = arc FA - arc FC = 44 - CF. Substituting into the total:

arc AC + arc CF = 74° => (44 - CF) + CF = 44 = 74°, which is impossible. So this suggests inconsistency.

At this point, I think I need to re-examine the initial assumptions. Maybe angle EFB is not an inscribed angle. Wait, but if point F is on the circle, and angle EFB is formed by chords FE and FB, then it should be an inscribed angle intercepting arc EB. So that part seems correct.

Maybe the issue is that arc EB is not 60°, but something else. Wait, let me double-check that. If angle EFB is an inscribed angle intercepting arc EB, then yes, arc EB = 2*angle EFB = 60°. So that part is correct.

But then why is there a contradiction in the other calculations? Perhaps the error is in assuming that angle EGB relates to arc FA. Maybe angle EGB relates to other arcs.

Let me try to consider that angle EGB is formed by two secants intersecting outside the circle. So, if G is outside the circle, and two secants from G pass through points E and B, and points F and something else. Wait, but we have angle EGB, so secants GE and GB. If G is outside, then the angle is ½(diff of intercepted arcs). Let's say the intercepted arcs are EB and another arc. For example, if the secants are GE and GB, then the intercepted arcs would be arc EB and arc FA (if there's another arc). But without knowing the other arc, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe the intercepted arcs are arc EB and arc CF. So angle EGB = ½(arc EB - arc CF). Then, 52 = ½(60 - arc CF) => 60 - arc CF = 104 => arc CF = 60 - 104 = -44°, which is impossible. So that's not working.

Wait, maybe it's the other way: angle EGB = ½(arc CF - arc EB). So 52 = ½(arc CF - 60) => arc CF - 60 = 104 => arc CF = 164°. But 164° is possible, but let's see if this fits with other information.

If arc CF is 164°, then let's check the total circle. Previously, we had arc FE = 118°, arc EB = 60°, arc AB = 108°, and arc CF = 164°. Let's see if these add up with other arcs.

But we also have arc FA, which we previously tried to calculate. If arc CF is 164°, then arc FA would depend on the arrangement. If point F is connected to A through C, then arc FA = arc FC + arc CA = 164 + arc CA. But without knowing arc CA, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, if arc CF is 164°, and arc FE is 118°, then the arc from F to E is 118°, and from C to F is 164°, but this depends on the placement of point C.

This is getting too speculative. Maybe I need to consider that arc CF is one of the answer choices. The options are A. 30, B. 44, C. 108, D. 118.

Option B is 44°, which appeared earlier in the calculation when trying to find arc FA. Maybe that's the answer. Let me check if there's a way to get 44° for arc CF.

If arc CF is 44°, then let's see. Let's assume arc CF = 44°. Then, from the total circle, if we have arc FE = 118°, arc EB = 60°, arc AB = 108°, arc CF = 44°, and what remains is arc from A to F, which would be arc AC + arc CF? No, if arc CF is from C to F, then from A to F would depend on the arrangement.

But earlier, we had from the total circle: arc AC + arc CF = 74°. If arc CF is 44°, then arc AC = 74 - 44 = 30°. So arc AC = 30°. Is there a way to verify this?

If arc AC is 30°, and arc AB is 108°, then arc CB would be arc CA + arc AB? No, if points are arranged as A, C, B, then arc AB = arc AC + arc CB. So arc CB = arc AB - arc AC = 108 - 30 = 78°. But I don't know if that helps.

Alternatively, if angle EGB = 52°, and if this angle is related to arc AC or arc CB. For example, if angle EGB is formed by intersecting arcs AC and EB, then 52 = ½(arc AC + arc EB). So 52 = ½(30 + 60) = ½(90) = 45, which is not 52. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if angle EGB is related to arc CF and arc EB: 52 = ½(arc CF - arc EB) => 52 = ½(44 - 60) = ½(-16) = -8, which is not valid.

Hmm. Another idea: if arc CF is 44°, then arc FA would be arc FE + arc EC + arc CF? Not sure. This is getting too tangled.

Wait, going back to the equation from angle EGB: if angle EGB = 52°, and assuming it's formed by two secants from G intercepting arcs EB and CF, then 52 = ½(arc EB - arc CF). Solving for arc CF: arc CF = arc EB - 104 = 60 - 104 = -44°, which is invalid. But if it's the other way: 52 = ½(arc CF - arc EB), then arc CF = 104 + arc EB = 104 + 60 = 164°, which is possible, but not among the options except D. 118 is an option, but 164 is not. So this doesn't match.

Wait, but maybe there's a mistake in assuming which arcs are intercepted. Maybe the angle EGB intercepts arc FB and arc something else. Let me try again.

If angle EGB is formed by two secants from G, and it intercepts arc FB and arc EA, then 52 = ½(arc FB + arc EA). Earlier, we had arc FB + arc EA = 104. If I can find arc FB, then I can find arc EA.

But how to find arc FB? If arc FE is 118° and arc EB is 60°, then arc FB is arc FE + arc EB = 178°, as before. Then, arc FB = 178°, so arc EA = 104 - 178 = -74°, which is invalid. So this suggests that my assumption about intercepted arcs is wrong.

At this point, I think I've exhausted the possibilities and keep hitting inconsistencies, which suggests I might have misinterpreted the configuration. Since I don't have the diagram, I need to make an educated guess based on standard problems.

Another common scenario is that angle EFB is an inscribed angle, giving arc EB = 60°, and angle EGB is an external angle, giving a relation between arcs. Let's assume that angle EGB is formed by two secants, so 52 = ½(arc EB - arc CF). Then, 52 = ½(60 - arc CF), so arc CF = 60 - 104 = -44°, which is impossible. But if it's ½(arc CF - arc EB), then 52 = ½(arc CF - 60) => arc CF = 164°, which is not an option. 

Wait, the answer choices are A. 30, B. 44, C. 108, D. 118. Let me check if 44° is possible. If arc CF is 44°, then from the earlier equation where arc EA + arc FB = 104°, and if arc FB is 178°, then arc EA = 104 - 178 = -74°, which is invalid. But if arc FB is the minor arc, then maybe arc FB is 360 - 178 = 182°, which is still greater than 180°, so it's a major arc. Then, arc EA = 104 - 182 = -78°, still invalid. 

This suggests that my initial assumption about angle EGB intercepting arcs is wrong. Maybe angle EGB is an inscribed angle itself? If G is on the circle, then angle EGB would be an inscribed angle, but that would require G to be on the circle, which may or may not be the case. 

Alternatively, maybe angle EGB is a right angle, but it's given as 52°. 

I think I'm stuck here. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll try to make an educated guess based on the available options. Since arc CF is requested, and one of the answer choices is 44°, which came up in earlier calculations, and given that arc EA + arc FB = 104°, and if I assume that arc FB is 118° (arc FE) + something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if arc CF is 44°, which is option B, and it's a plausible value based on some of the intermediate steps, I might choose B.
