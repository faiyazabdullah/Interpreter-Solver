MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. Hmm, so we have several lines and points mentioned. Let me start by listing out all the given predicates to visualize the setup.

First, the lines: Line(D,B), Line(J,L), Line(I,G), Line(C,F), Line(K,G), Line(A,E). Then there are points lying on these lines. For example, PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(I,G)) and also on Line(J,L). Similarly, E is on Line(J,L) and Line(C,F). H is on Line(D,B) and Line(C,F). Also, some parallel lines: Line(D,B) is parallel to Line(J,L), and Line(I,G) is parallel to Line(C,F).

The question gives us m∠3 = 110° and m∠12 = 55°, and asks for m∠13. The answer choices are A.55, B.65, C.70, D.110.

Wait, but I need to figure out where these angles ∠3, ∠12, and ∠13 are located. Since the problem mentions angles labeled 3, 12, and 13, they must be formed by the intersection of these lines. But without a diagram, I need to infer based on the given lines and points.

Let me try to sketch mentally. Let's note that Line(D,B) is parallel to Line(J,L). So maybe those two lines are cut by a transversal? Similarly, Line(I,G) is parallel to Line(C,F). 

Looking at the points: A lies on both Line(I,G) and Line(J,L). Wait, since A is on Line(I,G) and Line(J,L), that suggests that Lines(I,G) and (J,L) intersect at point A. But wait, earlier it was stated that Line(D,B) is parallel to Line(J,L). So if Line(J,L) intersects Line(I,G) at A, then Line(I,G) is not parallel to Line(J,L)? But according to the given, Line(I,G) is parallel to Line(C,F). Wait, maybe there's more structure here.

Also, E is on Line(J,L) and Line(C,F). So Line(J,L) and Line(C,F) intersect at E. And since Line(C,F) is parallel to Line(I,G), then Line(J,L) intersects Line(C,F) at E, which would mean that Line(J,L) is not parallel to Line(C,F). But Line(I,G) is parallel to Line(C,F), so Line(J,L) must intersect Line(I,G) at some point. But earlier, A is on both Line(I,G) and Line(J,L), so that's the intersection point A.

So, considering that, perhaps there's a transversal cutting through the parallel lines. Let me think about the angles. Since Line(D,B) || Line(J,L), and if there's a transversal, say Line(A,E) or another line, creating corresponding angles.

But maybe I should focus on the angles given. ∠3 and ∠12 are given. Let me assume that these angles are part of the intersections created by the parallel lines and transversals.

Since Line(D,B) is parallel to Line(J,L), and Line(I,G) is parallel to Line(C,F). Let me see if there are transversals crossing these pairs.

For instance, Line(A,E): A is on Line(I,G) and Line(J,L), so Line(A,E) could be a transversal. Let me check: E is on Line(J,L) and Line(C,F). So Line(A,E) connects A (on Line(J,L)) to E (also on Line(J,L))? Wait, no. Because E is on Line(J,L) and Line(C,F). So if A is on Line(J,L), then Line(A,E) would be along Line(J,L), making it a straight line. That doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, maybe Line(A,E) is a transversal cutting through other lines. Let me consider the points again. Points on Line(C,F) are E and H. So Line(C,F) has points E and H, and since Line(I,G) is parallel to Line(C,F), then Line(I,G) and Line(C,F) are two parallel lines. Maybe there's a transversal connecting them?

Similarly, Line(D,B) is parallel to Line(J,L). Let me think about the configuration. Suppose Line(D,B) and Line(J,L) are two parallel lines. Then, Line(A,E) might be a transversal intersecting them. But A is on Line(J,L) and Line(I,G). So if Line(I,G) is parallel to Line(C,F), then Line(I,G) and Line(C,F) are parallel. So maybe Line(A,E) crosses Line(C,F) at E, and Line(I,G) at A. Therefore, Line(A,E) is a transversal cutting through the parallel lines Line(I,G) and Line(C,F). Therefore, the angles formed at A and E would be corresponding or alternate interior angles.

But how does this relate to the given angles? Let's try to label the angles. Let me imagine that ∠3 and ∠12 are angles formed by these intersections. For example, if Line(D,B) is parallel to Line(J,L), then a transversal like Line(A,E) would create corresponding angles. However, without knowing exactly where the angles are, it's tricky. Alternatively, maybe ∠3 and ∠12 are vertical angles, supplementary angles, or something else.

Given that ∠3 is 110°, and ∠12 is 55°, which are likely adjacent or supplementary. Since 110 + 55 = 165, which isn't directly helpful. But if ∠3 and ∠12 are consecutive interior angles, their sum would be 180°, but 110+55=165, which doesn't fit. Wait, unless one is a supplement of the other. For example, if ∠3 is 110°, then its adjacent angle could be 70°, and ∠12 is 55°, which might be part of another relationship.

Alternatively, considering the parallel lines. If Line(D,B) || Line(J,L), and Line(A,E) is a transversal, then corresponding angles would be equal. Suppose ∠3 is a corresponding angle to ∠12, but that would require them to be equal. However, 110 ≠ 55, so that's not the case. Or maybe ∠3 is supplementary to ∠12, but again, 110 + 55 = 165, not 180. 

Wait, maybe ∠3 and ∠12 are same-side interior angles. If that were the case, their sum would be 180°. But 110 + 55 = 165, which is less than 180. Not matching. Unless there's another angle involved. 

Alternatively, maybe ∠3 and ∠12 are parts of different sets of parallel lines. For instance, Line(I,G) || Line(C,F), so if a transversal cuts them, then corresponding angles would be equal. Suppose ∠12 is a corresponding angle to ∠3, but again, numbers don't add up. 

Wait, maybe ∠3 is an exterior angle, and ∠12 is an interior angle. For example, in a triangle, the exterior angle equals the sum of the remote interior angles. But without knowing the triangle structure, this is speculative. 

Alternatively, think about the fact that Line(I,G) || Line(C,F), and Line(A,E) is a transversal. So, angles formed at A and E would be corresponding or alternate. Let's suppose that ∠3 is at point A, and ∠12 is at point E. If they are corresponding angles, then they should be equal, but 110 vs 55 contradicts that. If they're alternate interior angles, then they'd be equal too. So that's not matching. 

Alternatively, maybe ∠3 and ∠12 are vertical angles? No, because vertical angles are equal, and 110≠55. 

Wait, perhaps ∠3 and ∠12 are part of a linear pair. For example, if they are adjacent and form a straight line, their sum would be 180. But 110 + 55 = 165, which is not 180. So that's not it. 

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me look back at the given predicates. There's also Point H on Line(D,B) and Line(C,F). So Line(D,B) and Line(C,F) intersect at H? But Line(D,B) is parallel to Line(J,L), and Line(C,F) is parallel to Line(I,G). Wait, but Line(D,B) and Line(C,F) may not necessarily be parallel. Wait, the given says Parallel(Line(D,B), Line(J,L)), and Parallel(Line(I,G), Line(C,F)). So Line(D,B) || Line(J,L), and Line(I,G) || Line(C,F). But there's no direct statement about Line(D,B) and Line(C,F) being parallel. 

So H is a point common to both Line(D,B) and Line(C,F), implying that they intersect at H. Therefore, Line(D,B) and Line(C,F) are not parallel, hence they meet at H. This creates a transversal situation. Now, since Line(D,B) is parallel to Line(J,L), and Line(C,F) is parallel to Line(I,G), which might form some parallelogram or other structures.

Now, focusing on angles. Let me consider that Line(D,B) and Line(J,L) are parallel. Suppose Line(A,E) is a transversal. At point A, where Line(J,L) meets Line(I,G), and Line(A,E) passes through A. Also, E is on Line(J,L) and Line(C,F). So Line(A,E) goes from A (intersection of Line(J,L) and Line(I,G)) to E (on Line(J,L) and Line(C,F)). So Line(A,E) is along Line(J,L)? Wait, no. Because if E is on Line(J,L), then Line(A,E) is part of Line(J,L), since both A and E are on Line(J,L). Therefore, Line(A,E) is just a segment of Line(J,L). That seems trivial, so maybe my assumption is wrong. 

Wait, but E is on Line(C,F) as well. So Line(C,F) and Line(J,L) intersect at E. So Line(C,F) is not parallel to Line(J,L), since they meet at E. But Line(C,F) is parallel to Line(I,G), as per the given. So Line(I,G) is parallel to Line(C,F), and Line(J,L) intersects Line(C,F) at E. Therefore, Line(J,L) is not parallel to Line(I,G). 

At this point, I'm getting confused about the exact configuration. Perhaps I need to draw a rough sketch mentally. Let me outline the lines:

- Line(D,B) || Line(J,L)
- Line(I,G) || Line(C,F)
- A is on both Line(I,G) and Line(J,L)
- E is on both Line(J,L) and Line(C,F)
- H is on both Line(D,B) and Line(C,F)

Therefore, Line(J,L) intersects Line(I,G) at A and Line(C,F) at E. Line(D,B) intersects Line(C,F) at H. Since Line(D,B) || Line(J,L), and Line(C,F) is not parallel to Line(J,L) (as they meet at E), then Line(D,B) and Line(C,F) meet at H. 

Now, considering angles. Let's suppose that ∠3 and ∠12 are angles formed by the intersections. For example, at point A, where Line(I,G) and Line(J,L) meet, and Line(A,E) (which is part of Line(J,L))... Hmm, not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe ∠3 is at point A, formed by Line(I,G) and Line(A,E) (which is Line(J,L)). So ∠3 would be between Line(I,G) and Line(J,L) at A. Given that Line(I,G) || Line(C,F), and Line(J,L) intersects Line(C,F) at E. So if we draw Line(J,L) intersecting Line(C,F) at E, then ∠12 could be an angle at E involving Line(C,F) and another line. 

Alternatively, since Line(D,B) || Line(J,L), and Line(D,B) intersects Line(C,F) at H. So Line(D,B) and Line(C,F) form some angles at H. 

Maybe the key is to use the properties of parallel lines and transversals. For instance, if Line(D,B) || Line(J,L), then angles formed by a transversal would be equal. Let's say there's a transversal that creates angles with measures 110 and 55. 

Suppose ∠3 is an angle formed by Line(D,B) and a transversal, and ∠12 is another angle formed by the same transversal. For example, if ∠3 is a corresponding angle to ∠12, but they don't match. Or if they are consecutive interior angles, their sum would be 180. 110 + 55 = 165, which is not 180. So that's not it. 

Wait, but maybe ∠3 and ∠12 are part of different pairs. For example, ∠3 could be an exterior angle, and ∠12 an interior angle, leading to some relationship. 

Alternatively, since Line(I,G) || Line(C,F), and Line(A,E) is a transversal (if it's not colinear), then angles at A and E would be corresponding or alternate. Suppose ∠3 is at A, and ∠12 is at E. If they are corresponding angles, then they should be equal, but 110≠55. If they are alternate interior angles, same thing. 

Wait, maybe ∠12 is a vertical angle or supplementary to ∠3. For example, if ∠3 and ∠12 are supplementary, then 110 + x = 180 => x=70. But the question asks for ∠13. So maybe ∠13 is supplementary to ∠12, giving 180-55=125, which isn't among the options. Or if ∠13 is equal to ∠3, which is 110, but that's option D. But why?

Alternatively, let's think about triangle angles. Suppose there's a triangle with angles ∠3, ∠12, and ∠13. But without knowing the type of triangle, this is unclear. 

Another approach: since Line(D,B) || Line(J,L), and Line(C,F) intersects both. At point H on Line(D,B) and Line(C,F), forming angles. Similarly, at point E on Line(J,L) and Line(C,F). Maybe there are vertical angles or alternate angles here. 

Let me consider the angles around point H. Since Line(D,B) and Line(C,F) meet at H, creating vertical angles. Suppose ∠12 is one of those angles, 55 degrees. Then its vertical angle would also be 55, and the adjacent angles would be 180-55=125. But how does this connect to ∠3?

Alternatively, looking at Line(D,B) || Line(J,L). If there's a transversal cutting through them, such as Line(C,F), which intersects Line(D,B) at H and Line(J,L) at E. Then, the angles formed at H and E would be corresponding or alternate. 

For instance, the angle at H (between Line(D,B) and Line(C,F)) would correspond to the angle at E (between Line(J,L) and Line(C,F)). If ∠3 is that corresponding angle, then it would equal the angle at E. But ∠3 is 110, and ∠12 is 55. So maybe ∠12 is an angle at E, which is 55, and ∠3 is an angle at H, which is 110. Since Line(D,B) || Line(J,L), then those angles would be equal if they are corresponding. But 110 vs 55 don't match. 

Wait, unless ∠3 is an exterior angle. For example, if Line(C,F) is a transversal cutting through Line(D,B) and Line(J,L). Then, the exterior angle at H would be equal to the remote interior angle. Suppose ∠3 is an exterior angle, and ∠12 is one of the remote interior angles. Then, ∠3 = ∠12 + another angle. But 110 = 55 + x → x=55. So maybe ∠13 is that other angle, which would be 55. But that's option A. 

Alternatively, if ∠3 is an exterior angle and ∠12 is a non-adjacent interior angle, then ∠3 = ∠12 + ∠13. So 110 = 55 + ∠13 → ∠13 = 55. Which would make answer A. But I'm not sure if this applies here. 

Alternatively, maybe ∠13 is a vertical angle to ∠12, making it 55. But then answer A. 

But the problem states that ∠3 is 110, ∠12 is 55, find ∠13. If ∠3 and ∠12 are supplementary, then ∠3 + ∠12 = 165, which leaves 15 degrees for another angle, but that's not helpful. 

Wait, perhaps ∠13 is vertically opposite to ∠3. If ∠3 is 110, then ∠13 would also be 110. But that would be option D. But why would they be vertical angles? 

Alternatively, think about the parallel lines and transversals. Let's take Line(D,B) || Line(J,L). Suppose Line(C,F) is a transversal, cutting through them at H and E. Then, the angles at H and E would be either corresponding or alternate. 

Assume that at point H, the angle between Line(D,B) and Line(C,F) is ∠12 = 55°, then the corresponding angle at E would also be 55°. But if Line(C,F) is also intersecting Line(I,G) at A, which is parallel to Line(C,F), then the angles at A would be equal to those at E. 

Wait, Line(I,G) is parallel to Line(C,F). So if Line(C,F) intersects Line(I,G) at A, then the angles formed at A would be equal to those at E due to the parallel lines. So if ∠12 is at E, which is 55°, then the corresponding angle at A would also be 55°. But ∠3 is given as 110°, so maybe ∠3 is supplementary to that 55°, making it 180-55=125. But that doesn't align with given info. 

Alternatively, if ∠3 is an angle formed by Line(I,G) and another line, say Line(A,E). Since Line(I,G) is parallel to Line(C,F), and Line(A,E) is a transversal. If ∠3 is an alternate interior angle with respect to Line(C,F), then it would be equal. But again, 110 vs 55. 

This is confusing without seeing the diagram. Let me try to think differently. Since there are multiple parallel lines, maybe there are multiple transversals creating various angles. 

Let me list the angles again: ∠3=110, ∠12=55, find ∠13. Assuming that ∠3 and ∠12 are part of a set of angles formed by the intersections. 

Suppose ∠3 is an exterior angle formed by a transversal across parallel lines, and ∠12 is an interior angle. In that case, ∠3 = ∠12 + ∠13 (exterior angle theorem). So 110 = 55 + ∠13 → ∠13 = 55. Hence, answer A. 

Alternatively, if ∠3 and ∠12 are supplementary, then ∠13 could be ∠3 - ∠12, but that gives 55, again option A. 

Wait, but why would they be supplementary? Maybe ∠3 is supplementary to ∠12, making ∠13 equal to ∠12. But that depends on the configuration. 

Alternatively, if ∠13 is vertically opposite to ∠3, then it would be 110, option D. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging. However, given that ∠3 is 110, which is obtuse, and ∠12 is 55, acute, the answer likely involves supplementary or complementary angles. 

If ∠3 is an exterior angle, and ∠12 is one of the remote interior angles, then ∠13 would be the other remote interior angle. So ∠3 = ∠12 + ∠13 → 110 = 55 + ∠13 → ∠13 = 55. So answer A. 

Alternatively, if ∠13 is a vertical angle to ∠12, then answer A. 

But why would that be the case? It's possible that ∠13 is vertically opposite to ∠12, so same measure. 

But why would the problem give ∠3 as 110? Maybe ∠3 is an external angle to a triangle where ∠12 and ∠13 are the remote interior angles. 

Assuming that, then ∠3 = ∠12 + ∠13 → 110 = 55 + ∠13 → ∠13 = 55. 

Thus, the answer would be A. 

However, another possibility is that ∠13 is supplementary to ∠3. For example, if ∠3 and ∠13 are on a straight line, then ∠13 = 180 - 110 = 70. Which would be option C. 

But which is it? 

If the angles are on a straight line, then yes. But how do we know? 

Without the diagram, it's ambiguous. But given that the answer choices include both A and C, and the given angles are 110 and 55, which add to 165, suggesting that ∠13 could be 180-110=70, or 110-55=55. 

But which scenario fits the parallel lines? 

If Line(D,B) || Line(J,L), and a transversal forms ∠3=110 and ∠12=55, then depending on the position, ∠13 could be 55 or 70. 

Wait, if ∠3 is a corresponding angle to ∠12, then they should be equal, but they aren't. So that's not. 

But if ∠3 is supplementary to ∠12, then 110 + 55 = 165, which is not 180. So that's not. 

Alternatively, if ∠13 is a vertical angle to ∠12, then it's 55. 

Or, if ∠13 is an alternate interior angle to ∠3, then it's 110. 

But how to decide? 

Perhaps looking at the parallel lines. Let me consider Line(I,G) || Line(C,F). If Line(A,E) is a transversal, then the angles at A and E would be equal. Suppose ∠3 is at A, and ∠12 is at E. If they are alternate interior angles, then they should be equal. But since they are not, that suggests they are not alternate. 

Alternatively, if ∠3 is at E, and ∠12 is at A. Suppose ∠3 is an angle at E between Line(C,F) and Line(J,L), which is 110°, and ∠12 is an angle at A between Line(I,G) and Line(J,L), which is 55°. Since Line(I,G) || Line(C,F), the angle at A (∠12) would be equal to the angle at E (∠3) if they are corresponding angles. But since they are not equal, that suggests they are not corresponding. 

Wait, but maybe ∠3 is a consecutive interior angle with ∠12. If Line(I,G) || Line(C,F), and Line(J,L) is a transversal, then consecutive interior angles would be supplementary. So ∠3 + ∠12 = 180. But 110 + 55 = 165, which is not 180. So that doesn't hold. 

This is really confusing without the diagram. However, since the given answer choices include 55, 65, 70, 110, and the angles given are 110 and 55, I'll have to make an educated guess. 

If ∠3 is an exterior angle, and ∠12 and ∠13 are the remote interior angles, then ∠3 = ∠12 + ∠13 → 110 = 55 + ∠13 → ∠13 = 55. So answer A. 

Alternatively, if ∠13 is supplementary to ∠3, then 180 - 110 = 70, answer C. 

Which is more plausible? 

In many standard problems, when an exterior angle is given, it's often the sum of two remote interior angles. So if ∠3 is the exterior angle, and ∠12 is one of the remote, then ∠13 would be the other. Thus, ∠13 = 110 - 55 = 55. So answer A. 

But sometimes, the angles could be arranged differently. However, given that 55 is one of the answer choices, and 55 is already given as ∠12, it's possible that ∠13 is the same as ∠12, hence A. 

Alternatively, if ∠13 is vertical to ∠12, then same measure. 

But why would ∠3 be 110? It could be an exterior angle to a triangle with ∠12 and ∠13. 

Given that, I think the intended answer is A.55. 

But wait, let me check another way. If Line(D,B) || Line(J,L), and Line(C,F) is a transversal, then the angles formed at H and E would be corresponding. If ∠12 is 55 at E, then the corresponding angle at H would also be 55. But ∠3 is 110. If ∠3 is an angle at H, supplementary to that 55, then ∠3 = 180 - 55 = 125, which doesn't match. So that's not. 

Alternatively, if ∠3 is an angle formed by Line(D,B) and Line(C,F) at H, which is 110°, and ∠12 is an angle formed by Line(J,L) and Line(C,F) at E, which is 55°, then since Line(D,B) || Line(J,L), the angles at H and E would be supplementary. So 110 + 55 = 165, which isn't 180. So that's inconsistent. 

Wait, but if Line(C,F) is a transversal cutting through two parallel lines, the consecutive interior angles should be supplementary. So if ∠3 is one of them and ∠12 the other, then ∠3 + ∠12 = 180. But 110 + 55 = 165, which isn't 180. So this suggests that they are not consecutive interior angles. 

Unless there's another angle involved. Maybe ∠3 is an exterior angle, and ∠12 is an interior angle. Then, ∠3 = ∠12 + ∠13. So 110 = 55 + ∠13 → ∠13 = 55. 

This seems plausible. Hence, answer A. 

But another thought: if ∠13 is vertically opposite to ∠12, then it's 55. 

Either way, A seems likely. 

But I've seen similar problems where the answer is 70, which is 180-110. But why? 

Wait, if ∠3 is 110, and it's supplementary to ∠13, then ∠13 = 70. 

But why would they be supplementary? If they are adjacent angles forming a straight line. 

But how to know? Without the diagram, it's hard. 

But given that ∠3 is 110, which is an obtuse angle, and ∠12 is 55, which is acute, it's possible that ∠13 is 70. 

For example, if ∠13 is an angle formed by a transversal and a parallel line, where ∠3 is supplementary to ∠13. 

But I'm not certain. 

Given the ambiguity, but leaning towards the exterior angle theorem, I think the answer is A.55. 

But I'm not fully confident. Another angle: since Line(I,G) || Line(C,F), and Line(A,E) is a transversal, if ∠3 is an angle at A (on Line(I,G)) and ∠12 is an angle at E (on Line(C,F)), then they are corresponding angles and should be equal. But they are not, so that suggests they are not corresponding. But if ∠3 is an alternate interior angle with another angle at E, which is 55, then ∠3 should be 55, but it's given as 110. Contradiction. 

Wait, but if ∠3 is on the other side, maybe it's a supplementary angle. Like, if Line(A,E) is a transversal, and ∠3 is an exterior angle, while ∠12 is an interior angle. Then, ∠3 = ∠12 + ∠13. So 110 = 55 + ∠13 → ∠13 = 55. 

Yes, that makes sense. So answer A. 

I think that's the intended path. So Final Answer: A.
