Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So the question is about finding the measure of angle JKL in a parallelogram JKLM. Wait, but first, I need to make sure I understand all the given information correctly.

First, the problem states that Quadrilateral J, K, M, L is a parallelogram. So that means opposite sides are equal and parallel. But wait, there's also some other points mentioned like point R, and various angles and lengths. Let me list out all the given predicates again to organize my thoughts.

Given:
- Quadrilateral J, K, M, L (so it's a parallelogram? Or just a general quadrilateral? Wait, the term "parallelogram" is specified here. Wait, the user says "Use parallelogram J K L M", so maybe the quadrilateral is a parallelogram. So that would mean JM is parallel to KL, and JK is parallel to ML. Also, opposite sides are equal in length. 

But then there are several angles given:
- Angle at J, M, L: So angle JML? Wait, the notation Angle(J, M, L) usually represents the angle at point M between points J and L. So ∠JML. Similarly, Angle(M, L, K) is ∠MLK. Then Angle(J, R, L) is ∠JRL, and Angle(K, R, M) is ∠KRM. 

Also, some measures:
MeasureOf(Angle(J, M, L)) = 30 degrees. So ∠JML = 30°.
MeasureOf(Angle(M, L, K)) = 70°, so ∠MLK = 70°.
Then lengths:
LengthOf(Line(J, M)) = 3a
LengthOf(Line(J, K)) = 2b + 3
LengthOf(Line(L, K)) = 21
LengthOf(Line(M, L)) = 45

Wait, but since it's a parallelogram, opposite sides should be equal. So if JM and KL are opposite sides, then JM = KL. But given that LengthOf Line(J,M) is 3a and LengthOf Line(L,K) is 21. Therefore, 3a = 21 → a = 7. So that gives us JM = 21 units. Also, since JM is one side, and KL is opposite, so KL is also 21. But then the length of Line(M,L) is 45. Since in a parallelogram, adjacent sides are... Wait, in a parallelogram, consecutive sides are adjacent. So JM and ML are adjacent sides? Wait, no. Let me think about the structure of the parallelogram.

In a parallelogram JKLM, the order of the letters matters. Typically, the vertices are listed in order such that each consecutive pair forms a side. So J connected to K, K connected to L, L connected to M, and M connected back to J. So sides are JK, KL, LM, MJ. Therefore, opposite sides are JK and LM, KL and MJ. Wait, but the problem mentions quadrilateral J, K, L, M. So perhaps the order is J-K-L-M-J. So sides are JK, KL, LM, MJ. Therefore, opposite sides are JK and LM, KL and MJ. 

So given that, if JM is a diagonal? Wait, no. JM would be a diagonal if the points are ordered J-K-L-M. Wait, no. In a parallelogram, the diagonals connect opposite vertices. For example, in J-K-L-M, the diagonals would be JL and KM. Wait, but the problem mentions Line(J, M). So that's the segment connecting J to M. Which in the parallelogram would be a diagonal. Because in the order J-K-L-M, J is connected to K, K to L, L to M, and M back to J. So the segment JM connects J to M, which is a diagonal. Similarly, the segment KL is a side. 

But according to the given lengths, Line(J,M) has length 3a, and Line(L,K) is 21. Since in a parallelogram, the opposite sides are equal. Wait, but JM is a diagonal, not a side. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Alternatively, maybe the problem refers to the sides. Wait, the problem says "Quadrilateral J, K, M, L". Maybe the order is different? Like J-K-M-L-J? That would make JM and KL as opposite sides? Not sure. This could be confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to a parallelogram where the sides are JK, KL, LM, MJ. Therefore, opposite sides are JK and LM, KL and MJ. Therefore, if JM is a diagonal. Wait, but in that case, JM would be a diagonal. However, the given length for JM is 3a, and for KL is 21. If KL is a side, then KL equals MJ. So MJ is another side. Wait, but MJ is the same as JM. So if KL is 21, then JM is also 21. Therefore, 3a = 21 → a=7. So that's consistent. 

Now, looking at the angles. The given angles are ∠JML = 30°, ∠MLK = 70°. Let me visualize this. So point M is connected to L and J. So ∠JML is the angle at point M between points J and L. So that would be part of the parallelogram. Also, ∠MLK is the angle at point L between points M and K. 

Since it's a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. Wait, in a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. So if we can find some relations here. But maybe we can use triangle properties here because the angles given are parts of triangles formed by the diagonals?

Wait, let's consider triangle JML. Since JM is a diagonal, and ML is a side. Wait, ML is a side of the parallelogram. Wait, if the parallelogram is J-K-L-M, then ML is the side from M to L, which is adjacent to KL. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe considering triangle formed by points J, M, L. Given that ∠JML is 30°, and ∠MLK is 70°, which is at point L. 

Let me try to sketch mentally. Parallelogram JKLM. Points J, K, L, M. Sides JK, KL, LM, MJ. Diagonals JL and KM. Now, the angles mentioned: ∠JML is at M between J and L. So that's angle between JM and ML. And ∠MLK is at L between M and K. So that's angle between ML and LK. 

In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. But these angles may not necessarily be opposite angles. Wait, but if we can relate them via triangle properties. Let me think about triangle JML. In triangle JML, we know ∠JML = 30°, and we have sides JM = 3a = 21, ML = 45. Wait, ML is a side of the parallelogram. Since in the parallelogram, LM is equal to JK. Wait, but ML is the same as LM. So LM is a side. So if ML is 45, then LM = 45. So in triangle JML, we have two sides: JM = 21, ML = 45, and angle between them is 30°. Wait, but that seems like a triangle with sides 21, 45, and included angle 30°. But how does that relate to the rest of the parallelogram?

Additionally, there's ∠MLK = 70°, which is at point L, between M and K. So that angle is part of triangle MLK. Let me check that. Point L is connected to K and M. So ∠MLK is at L between points M and K. So that's angle between LM and LK. In the parallelogram, LM is equal to JK, and LK is equal to JM. Wait, no. Wait, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. So LM equals JK, and KL equals MJ. Wait, KL is a side. So KL is equal to MJ. Since MJ is 21, then KL is 21. But earlier, we had that KL is given as 21. So that checks out. 

So in triangle MLK, we have ML = 45, KL = 21, and angle at L (∠MLK) is 70°. Wait, but in triangle MLK, sides ML = 45, KL = 21, and angle between them is 70°. So maybe using the Law of Cosines here? Or Law of Sines? 

But how do these relate to the problem? The question asks for m∠JKL, which is the angle at point K between points J and L. So ∠JKL. Let me think about that. In the parallelogram, ∠JKL is one of the interior angles. 

In a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. So if we can find one angle, we can find its supplement. But how do we find that?

Alternatively, maybe using triangle properties. Let's see. Let me consider the entire parallelogram. Let's denote the angles. In a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So if one angle is x, the next is 180-x, and so on. But the given angles are parts of triangles. 

Wait, but the angles given are ∠JML = 30°, which is inside the parallelogram. How does that relate to the angles of the parallelogram? Let me think. 

In the parallelogram, the angles at each vertex are determined by the sides. But the angles given here are not the internal angles of the parallelogram, but rather angles formed by the diagonals. 

For example, ∠JML is formed by the diagonal JM and the side ML. Similarly, ∠MLK is formed by the diagonal MK and the side KL. Wait, but maybe I should draw the diagram to better understand.

Imagine parallelogram JKLM with points in order J, K, L, M. So sides JK, KL, LM, MJ. The diagonals are JL and KM. 

At point M, the angle between JM (diagonal) and ML (side) is 30°. At point L, the angle between ML (side) and LK (side) is 70°. 

Wait, but ∠MLK is at point L between points M and K. So that's the angle between LM and LK. In the parallelogram, LM is congruent to JK, and LK is congruent to MJ. 

But since ∠MLK is 70°, that is part of the angle at point L of the parallelogram. Wait, in the parallelogram, the internal angle at point L is made up of angles formed by the sides LM and LK. So ∠MLK is part of that internal angle? Wait, no. Wait, in the parallelogram, the internal angle at point L is between sides KL and LM. So that angle is exactly ∠KLM, which is the same as ∠MLK. Wait, ∠KLM is the angle at L between K and M, which is the same as ∠MLK. So ∠KLM = 70°. 

Therefore, in the parallelogram, one of the internal angles is 70°, so the adjacent angle would be 180 - 70 = 110°. But how does that help us with ∠JKL?

Wait, the question is asking for ∠JKL, which is the internal angle at point K between points J and L. So that's the angle at point K between sides JK and KL. In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So if ∠KLM = 70°, then the opposite angle would be ∠JMK? Or wait, in a parallelogram, the opposite angles are equal. So ∠KLM is at point L, so the opposite angle is at point J. Wait, maybe I need to clarify.

In parallelogram JKLM, the internal angles are at points J, K, L, M. Opposite angles are equal. So ∠J and ∠L are equal; ∠K and ∠M are equal. But ∠KLM is the angle at point L between K and M, which is the same as ∠L. Wait, no. Wait, ∠KLM is the angle at point L between K and M. So that's the internal angle at point L. So in the parallelogram, ∠L is 70°, so then ∠J is also 70°, and the other two angles (∠K and ∠M) are 180 - 70 = 110° each. 

But the question is asking for ∠JKL, which is the angle at point K between points J and L. That is, ∠JKL is the internal angle at point K. So if ∠L is 70°, then ∠K is 110°, making ∠JKL = 110°, but none of the options is 110. Wait, the options are A.60, B.70, C.80, D.90. So that suggests that my assumption is wrong. 

Hmm, maybe I misinterpreted the angles. Let me re-examine. 

The given angles are ∠JML = 30°, which is at point M between J and L. So that's not the internal angle at M. Instead, it's the angle formed by the diagonal JM and the side ML. Similarly, ∠MLK = 70° is at point L between M and K, which is part of the internal angle at L. 

So perhaps I need to use triangle properties involving those angles. 

Let me focus on triangle JML. In triangle JML, we have sides JM = 21, ML = 45, and angle at M is 30°. Using the Law of Cosines, we can find the third side JL. 

Law of Cosines: c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(C). Here, in triangle JML, angle at M is 30°, sides JM = 21, ML = 45. So the side opposite angle M is JL. 

So JL² = JM² + ML² - 2*JM*ML*cos(30°)
JL² = 21² + 45² - 2*21*45*(√3/2)
Calculate that:

21² = 441
45² = 2025
Sum: 441 + 2025 = 2466
Subtract 2*21*45*(√3/2) → which simplifies to 21*45*√3
So JL² = 2466 - 21*45√3 ≈ ?

But maybe I don't need to compute it numerically yet. 

Now, in the parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. But perhaps we can find more relations. Alternatively, look at triangle MLK, which includes ∠MLK = 70°, with sides ML = 45, KL = 21. 

Using Law of Cosines again on triangle MLK. 

Wait, in triangle MLK, sides ML = 45, KL = 21, and angle at L is 70°. So we can find the third side, which is MK. 

Law of Cosines again: MK² = ML² + KL² - 2*ML*KL*cos(angle at L)
So MK² = 45² + 21² - 2*45*21*cos(70°)
Compute that:

Same as before, 45² +21² = 2025 + 441 = 2466
Minus 2*45*21*cos(70°)
Which is 1890 * cos(70°)

So MK² = 2466 - 1890*cos(70°)

But I wonder if there's a relationship between the diagonals in a parallelogram. In a parallelogram, the sum of the squares of the diagonals equals twice the sum of the squares of the sides. 

But maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, since we have two triangles JML and MLK, maybe they share some relation. 

Alternatively, since the problem involves point R, with angles ∠JRL and ∠KRM. Wait, the problem also includes point R with angles ∠JRL and ∠KRM. Are there any properties related to point R? 

Wait, the problem says "Point(R)" and then gives Angle(J, R, L) and Angle(K, R, M). So point R is somewhere in the plane, forming angles with J, L and K, M respectively. Perhaps R lies on a particular line or has some relation to the parallelogram? 

But without more information about R, maybe these angles are related to something else. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention anything about R being on a specific line or having any other constraints except those angles. 

This seems like it might complicate things, but perhaps there's a way to use those angles. Let me think. 

If I consider the angles at point R: ∠JRL and ∠KRM. These might form a straight line or something. Alternatively, maybe point R is the intersection of the diagonals? In a parallelogram, diagonals intersect at the midpoint. Let me assume that R is the intersection point of the diagonals. 

In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. So if R is the intersection of diagonals JL and KM, then R would divide each diagonal into two equal parts. 

If that's the case, then ∠JRL and ∠KRM might be vertical angles or something. Let me explore this possibility. 

Assume R is the intersection of diagonals JL and KM. Then, in that case, ∠JRL would be the angle at R between JR and RL. Similarly, ∠KRM would be the angle at R between KR and RM. 

In a parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other, so R is the midpoint of both diagonals. Also, the diagonals in a parallelogram bisect each other but aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a rhombus. 

If that's the case, then maybe we can use the fact that the sum of certain angles around point R would be 180°, or use triangle properties. 

But given that ∠JML = 30°, which is at point M, and ∠MLK = 70°, which is at point L. If R is the intersection of diagonals, then maybe we can find angles in triangles formed by the diagonals. 

Alternatively, since we have angles at M and L, maybe using triangle properties with those angles. 

Wait, going back to triangle JML. We found that JL² = 2466 - 21*45*√3. Similarly, in triangle MLK, MK² = 2466 - 1890*cos(70°). But how does this help us? 

Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines in triangle JML and MLK to find other angles. 

In triangle JML: 
∠JML = 30°, sides JM = 21, ML = 45, JL = ?
Let’s denote angle at J as α and angle at L as β. Then α + β + 30° = 180° → α + β = 150°.

By Law of Sines:
sin(α)/ML = sin(30°)/JL
Similarly,
sin(β)/JM = sin(30°)/JL

But without knowing JL, this might not help directly. 

However, in the parallelogram, diagonals split it into triangles. Maybe there's a relation between these triangles. 

Alternatively, focusing on triangle MLK. It has angle at L = 70°, sides ML = 45, KL = 21. Again, applying Law of Sines:

sin(angle at M)/KL = sin(70°)/MK

But again, without knowing MK, this is tricky. 

Wait, maybe there's another approach. Since it's a parallelogram, vectors could be helpful. But since I'm not sure, maybe using coordinate geometry. 

Let me assign coordinates to the points. Let me place point M at the origin (0,0). Since JM is a diagonal with length 21, and ML is a side with length 45. Let me define coordinates based on that. 

Let me suppose that point M is at (0,0). Let me take ML along the x-axis for simplicity. So point L is at (45, 0). 

Now, point J is such that JM has length 21. Also, angle at M (∠JML) is 30°, so the direction from M to J makes a 30° angle with ML. Since ML is along the positive x-axis from M(0,0) to L(45,0), then the angle between JM and ML is 30°, so JM is at 30° above the x-axis. 

So point J can be located by moving 21 units from M at 30°. Coordinates of J would be (21*cos(30°), 21*sin(30°)). 

cos(30°) = √3/2 ≈ 0.866, sin(30°)= 0.5. 

Thus, J has coordinates (21*(√3/2), 21*(1/2)) = ( (21√3)/2 , 21/2 )

Now, point K needs to be determined. Since it's a parallelogram, vector JM equals vector LK. Wait, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. So vector JK equals vector LM. Vector LM is from L to M: M - L = (0-45, 0-0) = (-45, 0). Therefore, vector JK should be equal to vector LM. So vector JK = (-45, 0). 

Vector JK is from J to K: K - J = (-45, 0). So K = J + (-45, 0). 

Coordinates of J are ((21√3)/2, 21/2 ). Adding (-45, 0) to get K: 

x-coordinate: (21√3)/2 - 45 

y-coordinate: 21/2 + 0 = 21/2 

So K is at ( (21√3)/2 - 45 , 21/2 )

Now, we can find coordinates of K and L, then calculate ∠JKL. 

Point L is at (45, 0). Point K is at ((21√3)/2 - 45 , 21/2 ). Point J is at ((21√3)/2, 21/2 ). 

We need to find ∠JKL, which is the angle at point K between points J, K, and L. 

To find this angle, we can use vectors. Compute vectors KJ and KL, then find the angle between them. 

Vector KJ is J - K = [(21√3)/2 - ( (21√3)/2 - 45 ), 21/2 - 21/2 ] = (45, 0). 

Vector KL is L - K = (45 - [ (21√3)/2 - 45 ], 0 - 21/2 ) = (45 - (21√3)/2 + 45, -21/2 ) = (90 - (21√3)/2, -21/2 )

Now, the angle between vectors KJ and KL is ∠JKL. 

The formula for the angle θ between vectors u and v is:

cosθ = (u · v) / (|u| |v|)

First, compute the dot product of KJ and KL. 

Vector KJ = (45, 0)
Vector KL = (90 - (21√3)/2, -21/2 )

Dot product = 45*(90 - (21√3)/2) + 0*(-21/2) = 45*(90 - (21√3)/2)

Magnitude of KJ is sqrt(45² + 0²) = 45

Magnitude of KL is sqrt[ (90 - (21√3)/2)^2 + (-21/2)^2 ]

This looks complicated, but maybe we can simplify. 

Alternatively, notice that in this coordinate system, we have the vectors and can compute the angle. Let's proceed step by step.

First, compute the numerator: 45*(90 - (21√3)/2 )

Let me factor out 45:

Numerator = 45*[90 - (21√3)/2 ]

Denominator is |KJ| * |KL| = 45 * |KL|

So cosθ = [45*(90 - (21√3)/2 )] / [45 * |KL| ] = [90 - (21√3)/2 ] / |KL|

So we need to compute |KL|. 

Let me compute the components of KL:

x-component: 90 - (21√3)/2 

y-component: -21/2 

So |KL|² = [90 - (21√3)/2]^2 + ( -21/2 )^2 

Expand [90 - (21√3)/2]^2:

= 90² - 2*90*(21√3)/2 + [ (21√3)/2 ]² 

= 8100 - 90*21√3 + (441 * 3)/4 

= 8100 - 1890√3 + 1323/4 

Now add ( -21/2 )² = 441/4 

Total |KL|² = 8100 - 1890√3 + 1323/4 + 441/4 

Combine fractions: (1323 + 441)/4 = 1764/4 = 441 

So |KL|² = 8100 - 1890√3 + 441 = 8541 - 1890√3 

Thus, |KL| = sqrt(8541 - 1890√3 )

Now, the numerator was 90 - (21√3)/2 

Let me express 90 as 180/2, so:

Numerator = 180/2 - (21√3)/2 = [180 - 21√3]/2 

So cosθ = [180 - 21√3]/2 divided by sqrt(8541 - 1890√3 )

This expression seems very complex. Maybe there's a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler way. 

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in assigning coordinates. Let me double-check. 

I assumed point M at (0,0), point L at (45,0), then computed point J based on angle at M being 30°, with JM = 21. Then used vector LM to find point K. 

Wait, vector LM is from L to M: M - L = (0-45, 0-0) = (-45, 0). So vector JK should be equal to vector LM, hence vector JK = (-45, 0). So yes, K = J + vector JK. 

But maybe there's an error in assuming the direction of the vectors. Alternatively, perhaps I should use another method. 

Alternatively, since we have the coordinates of points J, K, L, we can compute the slopes of KJ and KL to find the angle. 

But this seems messy. Let me see if there's another approach. 

Earlier, I thought that the internal angle at L is 70°, but that might not be the case. Wait, ∠MLK is 70°, which is the angle at L between M and K. In the parallelogram, this is indeed the internal angle at L. So ∠KLM = 70°, which implies that the internal angle at L is 70°, making the adjacent angle at K equal to 110°, since consecutive angles in a parallelogram are supplementary. 

But the question is asking for ∠JKL, which is the internal angle at K. If that's true, then ∠JKL would be 110°, but that's not among the options. Hence, my assumption must be wrong. 

Wait, why did I think that ∠MLK is the internal angle at L? Let me confirm. 

In a parallelogram, the internal angle at L is between sides KL and LM. So ∠KLM is the angle at L between K and M. Yes, that is exactly ∠MLK. So ∠KLM = 70°, which is the internal angle at L. Thus, the internal angle at K would be supplementary to that, so 180 - 70 = 110°. But this isn't an option. 

Hmm. So either I made a wrong assumption, or there's more to it. Let me check the given data again. 

Wait, the problem mentions that JKLM is a parallelogram, but also provides angles involving point R. Maybe point R is not the intersection of the diagonals? 

The problem states Angle(J, R, L) and Angle(K, R, M). If R is a point such that these angles are defined, maybe R is somewhere else. 

Alternatively, perhaps R is the intersection of the diagonals? Let me assume that and see if that helps. 

If R is the intersection of diagonals JL and KM, then in that case, the diagonals bisect each other. So the angles at R would be formed by the diagonals. 

But how does that relate to the given angles? 

For instance, ∠JRL is the angle at R between J and L. Similarly, ∠KRM is the angle at R between K and M. 

If diagonals intersect at R, then ∠JRL and ∠KRM would be vertically opposite angles or supplementary. 

Wait, in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, so they split each other into two equal parts. The angles formed at R would depend on the type of parallelogram. 

But without knowing if it's a rectangle or a rhombus, we can't say much. 

Alternatively, maybe the given angles at R are related to the triangles we discussed earlier. 

For example, ∠JRL is part of triangle JRL, and ∠KRM is part of triangle KRM. 

But this seems too vague. 

Alternatively, since we have angles at M and L, and the lengths, perhaps we can use the Law of Sines in triangles involving R. 

But without knowing where R is, it's hard to proceed. 

Maybe there's a property I'm missing. Let me think differently. 

The problem gives us several angles and lengths. Let me recap:

- ∠JML = 30°
- ∠MLK = 70°
- JM = 3a = 21 => a=7
- KL = 21 (since it's a parallelogram, KL equals MJ)
- ML = 45
- JK = 2b + 3 (but we don't know b)
- Also, other lengths like Line(J, K) is 2b+3, but we might not need it if we can find relations through angles.

Wait, but maybe using the Law of Sines in triangle JML and MLK to find other angles, then combining them. 

In triangle JML: sides JM=21, ML=45, angle at M=30°. Let's find the other angles. 

Using Law of Sines:

sin(∠J)/ML = sin(∠M)/JL 

Wait, but we don't know JL. Alternatively, let's use Law of Cosines to find JL, then use Law of Sines to find other angles. 

Earlier, I calculated JL² = 2466 - 21*45*√3. Let me compute this numerically. 

First, 21*45 = 945. So 21*45*√3 ≈ 945 * 1.732 ≈ 945 * 1.732 ≈ let's calculate:

945 * 1.732 ≈ 945 * 1.7 = 1596.5 + 945 * 0.032 ≈ 1596.5 + 30.24 = 1626.74

So JL² ≈ 2466 - 1626.74 = 839.26 → JL ≈ sqrt(839.26) ≈ 28.97 units. 

Now, in triangle JML, with sides JM=21, ML=45, JL≈28.97. Let's find ∠J and ∠L. 

Using Law of Cosines for ∠J: 

cos(∠J) = (JM² + JL² - ML²)/(2*JM*JL)

Plugging in:

cos(∠J) = (21² + 28.97² - 45²)/(2*21*28.97)

Calculate numerator:

21² = 441

28.97² ≈ 840 (since 29²=841)

45² = 2025

So numerator ≈ 441 + 840 - 2025 = 1281 - 2025 = -744

Thus, cos(∠J) ≈ -744/(2*21*28.97) ≈ -744/(1217.0) ≈ -0.611

Thus, ∠J ≈ arccos(-0.611) ≈ 127.5 degrees

Similarly, ∠L would be 180 - 30 - 127.5 = 22.5 degrees. 

Wait, but this seems arbitrary. Let me verify. 

Wait, in triangle JML, angles sum to 180. So if ∠M=30°, and ∠J≈127.5°, then ∠L = 180 - 30 - 127.5 = 22.5°. 

Now, in triangle MLK, which has sides ML=45, KL=21, angle at L=70°. Let's apply Law of Cosines to find MK. 

As before, MK² = 45² + 21² - 2*45*21*cos(70°)

Calculate this:

45² + 21² = 2025 + 441 = 2466

2*45*21 = 1890

cos(70°) ≈ 0.3420

So 1890 * 0.3420 ≈ 1890 * 0.34 = 642.6 + 1890 * 0.002 = 642.6 + 3.78 = 646.38

So MK² ≈ 2466 - 646.38 = 1819.62 → MK ≈ sqrt(1819.62) ≈ 42.66 units.

Now, using Law of Sines in triangle MLK:

sin(∠M)/KL = sin(70°)/MK

Wait, ∠M is the angle at M in triangle MLK. Let me clarify. 

In triangle MLK, the angles are at M, L, K. We know angle at L is 70°, sides ML=45, KL=21, and MK≈42.66. 

Using Law of Sines:

sin(∠M)/KL = sin(∠L)/MK

So sin(∠M)/21 = sin(70°)/42.66

Calculate sin(70°) ≈ 0.9397

So sin(∠M) ≈ (21 * 0.9397) / 42.66 ≈ 19.7337 / 42.66 ≈ 0.462

Thus, ∠M ≈ arcsin(0.462) ≈ 27.5 degrees

So angles in triangle MLK: ∠L=70°, ∠M≈27.5°, and ∠K = 180 - 70 - 27.5 = 82.5°

Now, what does this tell us? 

In triangle JML, we found ∠L ≈ 22.5°, and in triangle MLK, ∠M ≈ 27.5°. 

Wait, but these angles might relate to the angles in the parallelogram. 

For example, ∠L in triangle JML is at point L, between J and M. Wait, but in the parallelogram, the angle at L is between K and M. 

Wait, but in triangle JML, ∠L is between J and M, which is part of the parallelogram. So this angle is part of the internal angle at L. 

But earlier, we had ∠MLK = 70°, which is the angle at L between M and K. So if in triangle MLK, the angle at L is 70°, and in triangle JML, the angle at L is 22.5°, then the total internal angle at L would be 70° + 22.5° = 92.5°. 

Wait, that doesn't align with previous assumptions. This suggests that the internal angle at L is 92.5°, which would make the adjacent angle at K equal to 180 - 92.5 = 87.5°, which is close to 88°, but still not matching the answer choices. 

But the options are 60, 70, 80, 90. 

Hmm. This suggests that my calculations might be off due to approximations, or perhaps my initial assumption about the configuration is incorrect. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a property I missed. Let me think again about the angles. 

Wait, in triangle JML, ∠L is 22.5°, and in triangle MLK, ∠M is 27.5°. These angles might be related to the angles of the parallelogram. 

But how? Let me recall that in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, and the angles created by the diagonals are related to the angles of the parallelogram. 

For example, in a parallelogram, the diagonals divide it into four triangles. The angles formed at the intersection of the diagonals are related to the original angles. 

But without knowing if the parallelogram is a rhombus or rectangle, it's difficult to say. 

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the sum of the angles at M and L in the triangles relates to the internal angles of the parallelogram. 

Wait, at point M, we have ∠JML = 30°, which is part of the angle at M in the parallelogram. Similarly, at point L, we have ∠MLK = 70°, which is part of the angle at L. 

If the internal angle at M is composed of ∠JML and another angle, and similarly for L. 

But in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So if I can find the internal angles at M and L, I can derive the others. 

Let me assume that at point M, the internal angle of the parallelogram is composed of ∠JML (30°) and another angle. Let's call the other angle at M as x. Similarly, at point L, the internal angle is composed of ∠MLK (70°) and another angle y. 

But how to find x and y? 

In a parallelogram, the sum of the internal angles at M and L should satisfy certain conditions. 

Wait, the internal angle at M plus the internal angle at L equals 180°, because in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. 

So, if the internal angle at M is 30° + x, and at L is 70° + y, then (30+x) + (70+y) = 180 → x + y = 80. 

But without more information, this doesn't directly help. 

Alternatively, if the diagonals bisect the angles, but only in a rhombus. Since we don't know if it's a rhombus, this might not apply. 

But if we assume that the diagonals bisect the angles, then x = 30° and y = 70°, making the internal angles at M and L as 30 + 30 = 60° and 70 + 70 = 140°, respectively. But this would imply that the internal angles at M and L are 60° and 140°, which are supplementary (60 + 140 = 200, which is not 180). So this is invalid. 

Wait, maybe the diagonals bisect each other but not necessarily the angles. 

Alternatively, maybe using the triangles' angles. 

From earlier calculations, in triangle JML, the angle at L was approximately 22.5°, and in triangle MLK, the angle at M was approximately 27.5°. If these are parts of the internal angles at L and M, respectively, then:

Internal angle at L = 70° + 22.5° = 92.5°
Internal angle at M = 30° + 27.5° = 57.5°

These would be supplementary? 92.5 + 57.5 = 150°, which is not 180°. So this contradicts the parallelogram property. 

This suggests that there's an inconsistency, likely due to my approximation errors. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a precise calculation. Let me try to calculate the exact values using trigonometry. 

Let me go back to triangle JML. 

We have sides JM = 21, ML = 45, angle at M = 30°. Let me use Law of Cosines to find JL precisely. 

JL² = 21² + 45² - 2*21*45*cos(30°)
= 441 + 2025 - 1890*(√3/2)
= 2466 - 945√3

Now, let's compute this value numerically:

√3 ≈ 1.732, so 945*1.732 ≈ 945 * 1.732 = let's calculate 900*1.732 + 45*1.732 = 1558.8 + 77.94 = 1636.74

So JL² ≈ 2466 - 1636.74 = 829.26

JL ≈ sqrt(829.26) ≈ 28.8

Now, using Law of Sines in triangle JML:

sin(∠J)/ML = sin(∠M)/JL

So sin(∠J)/45 = sin(30°)/28.8

sin(∠J) = 45 * sin(30°) / 28.8 = 45 * 0.5 / 28.8 = 22.5 / 28.8 ≈ 0.78125

Thus, ∠J ≈ arcsin(0.78125) ≈ 51.3 degrees

Wait, arcsin(0.78125) is approximately 51.3°, because sin(51°) ≈ 0.7771, sin(52°) ≈ 0
