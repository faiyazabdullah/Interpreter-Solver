Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out what they mean. 

So, we have points A, B, and C. The first thing mentioned is that Angle(B, C, A) is a right angle. Wait, angle at point C? Because the order is B-C-A, so the vertex is C. So angle at C is a right angle. Then it says MeasureOf(Angle(C, B, A)) equals 61 degrees. Wait, that seems conflicting because if angle at C is a right angle, then that angle should be 90 degrees. But here it's saying MeasureOf(Angle(C, B, A)) is 61. Hmm, maybe there's confusion here. Let me check again.

Wait, the measure of angle CBA? Wait, the notation Angle(C, B, A) would be the angle at point B between points C and A. Wait, no—angle notation is typically written as Angle(ABC), which is the angle at point B. So Angle(B, C, A) would be the angle at point C between points B and A. So that's angle ACB, which is at point C. But then the next predicate says MeasureOf(Angle(C, B, A)) = 61. Wait, that's Angle(C, B, A)—so vertex at B, with sides BC and BA. So that's angle ABC. Wait, but earlier we had that angle at C (ACB) is a right angle. So that means triangle ABC has a right angle at C, making it a right-angled triangle. But then the measure of angle ABC is 61 degrees?

But wait, if the triangle is right-angled at C, then angles at A and B must add up to 90 degrees. So angle ABC (at B) is 61 degrees, then angle at A would be 90 - 61 = 29 degrees. Let me confirm that.

Also, given that LengthOf(Line(A,C)) = 24. That's side AC. And LengthOf(Line(B,A)) = x. Which is side AB. Since it's a right-angled triangle at C, we can use trigonometry or Pythagoras. Wait, but which sides correspond to which?

In triangle ABC, right-angled at C. So sides:

- AC is one leg, length 24.

- BC is another leg.

- AB is the hypotenuse, which is opposite the right angle. Wait, no. In a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. Since the right angle is at C, then AB is the hypotenuse. Therefore, AB² = AC² + BC². But we don't know BC. However, we also know angle at B is 61 degrees. So perhaps we can use trigonometric ratios here.

Let me visualize the triangle. Right-angled at C. So angle at B is 61°, angle at A is 29°, since angles sum to 180. Now, in such a triangle, we can relate the sides using sine or cosine.

For example, considering angle at B (61°). The adjacent side to angle B is BC, and the hypotenuse is AB. So cos(angle B) = adjacent / hypotenuse = BC / AB. Alternatively, sin(angle B) = opposite / hypotenuse = AC / AB. Wait, AC is opposite angle B. Because in triangle ABC, angle B is at point B, so the side opposite is AC. Yes. So:

sin(61°) = AC / AB → AB = AC / sin(61°)

Given that AC is 24, so AB = 24 / sin(61°). Let me compute that.

First, calculate sin(61°). Using calculator, sin(60°) is √3/2 ≈ 0.8660, sin(61°) is slightly higher. Let me get precise value. Let me recall that sin(61°) ≈ 0.8746 (exact value may vary depending on calculation).

So AB ≈ 24 / 0.8746 ≈ ?

Let me do division: 24 divided by 0.8746. Let me compute 24 ÷ 0.8746.

Well, 0.8746 × 27 = approx 23.6142. Close to 24. So 27 gives 23.61, difference is 24 - 23.61 = 0.39. So how much more than 27?

Each 0.1 increase in multiplier adds 0.08746 to the product. So to get 0.39, need approximately 0.39 / 0.08746 ≈ 4.46. So total multiplier is 27 + 0.446 ≈ 27.446. So approximately 27.45. Looking at answer choices, option C is 27.44. So likely answer is C.

Alternatively, let me compute more accurately. Let me find sin(61°):

Using calculator input: 61 degrees. Sin(61) ≈ 0.874619707...

Then 24 divided by 0.874619707 ≈ 24 / 0.874619707 ≈ 27.44. Exactly matching option C.

Therefore, the answer is C. 27.44.

Wait, but let me check if there's another way. For instance, using tangent. At angle B, tan(angle B) = opposite / adjacent = AC / BC. But since we don't know BC, but AB is hypotenuse. Alternatively, using Pythagoras once we find BC.

But since we can directly use the sine ratio here, as angle B is known, and AC is opposite to angle B, so yes, AB = AC / sin(angle B). Thus, the calculation holds.

Hence, the correct answer is C.
