Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we need to find the measure of angle ABC, given some predicates. Let me start by breaking down the information provided.

First, the given predicates:

1. Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A)), 2x - 15)
2. Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B)), x - 5)
3. Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,C,A)), 148)
4. PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(B, C))
5. Collinear(D, C, A)

Wait, so Angle(A) here probably refers to angle at point A? But I need to clarify the notation. In geometry, Angle(X) usually denotes the angle at vertex X. However, sometimes it could be ambiguous. Also, the third predicate mentions Angle(D,C,A), which would be the angle at point C between points D and A. So, that's angle DC A, meaning vertex at C, with sides CD and CA.

Also, Collinear(D, C, A) means that points D, C, and A are on the same straight line. So, D-C-A are collinear, implying that line DA passes through C. Therefore, angle DCA is a straight line? Wait, but the measure of angle DCA is given as 148 degrees. Wait, if D, C, A are collinear, then angle DCA should be a straight angle, which is 180 degrees. But here it's given as 148. That seems contradictory. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation.

Wait, maybe Angle(D,C,A) is not referring to the angle at C, but perhaps something else? Wait, standard notation for angles: Angle(ABC) is the angle at point B between points A and C. So Angle(D,C,A) would be the angle at point C between points D and A. So, that's angle DCA. Since D, C, A are collinear, then angle DCA should be 180 degrees. But the given measure is 148. That doesn't make sense unless there's a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the points aren't in order? Maybe D, C, A are collinear, but the angle isn't a straight line. Wait, if three points are collinear, then they lie on a straight line, so angle at C between D and A would be a straight angle. Unless there's another point involved. Wait, but the problem says Collinear(D, C, A). So, D, C, A are on a straight line. Then angle DCA is formed by points D, C, A. Wait, but if C is between D and A, then the angle at C between D and A would be a straight angle. But according to the given, it's 148 degrees. There's a contradiction here. So maybe there's a misinterpretation.

Alternatively, maybe the angle is not at point C. Let me check again. The notation Angle(D,C,A) typically represents the angle at point C between points D and A. So yes, angle DCA. Which would be a straight angle if D, C, A are collinear. Hence, the given measure being 148 suggests that maybe the points are not in the order D-C-A? Or perhaps the angle is not a straight angle?

Wait, but the predicate also states that PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(B, C)). So point A lies on line BC. Wait, because Line(B, C) is the line passing through B and C. So point A is on line BC. And Collinear(D, C, A) implies that D, C, A are on the same line. Therefore, since A is on line BC, and D is also on line BC (since D, C, A are collinear), so line BC contains points B, C, A, D. So the entire line BC has points D, C, A, and B? Or maybe arranged differently.

Let me try to visualize. Suppose line BC has points D, C, A, and possibly B. Since A lies on line BC, and D is collinear with C and A, then D is somewhere along the line BC. So, the arrangement could be D---C---A---B or some other order. But the angle DCA is given as 148 degrees. If D, C, A are collinear, then angle DCA would be 180 degrees. But it's given as 148. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, I must have made a wrong assumption.

Wait, maybe the points are not in the order D-C-A. For example, maybe the collinearity is D, A, C? Wait, the predicate says Collinear(D, C, A), so the order is D, C, A. So D, C, A are on a straight line. Therefore, angle DCA is at point C between D and A, which would be a straight angle. So why is it given as 148? This suggests that either the problem has a typo, or I'm misinterpreting the angle notation.

Wait, maybe the angle is not at point C. Maybe the notation is different. Perhaps Angle(D,C,A) is meant to represent the angle at point A? No, that wouldn't make sense. Normally, the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(D,C,A) is the angle at C. 

Alternatively, could there be a diagram where even though D, C, A are collinear, the angle DCA is formed in a different way? For instance, if there's another point involved? Or maybe the angle is not between DC and CA, but between CD and CA? Wait, that's the same thing. 

This inconsistency suggests that perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The user provided:

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,C,A)), 148)

So, angle DCA measures 148 degrees. But if D, C, A are collinear, then angle DCA should be 180 degrees. Therefore, there's a conflict here. How can this be resolved?

Wait, maybe the points are not in the order D-C-A. Suppose instead that the collinearity is D, A, C. Then, the angle at C between D and A would require that D is connected to C and A is connected to C, forming an angle. But if D, A, C are collinear, then the angle at C would still be straight. Alternatively, maybe the angle is not at C but at another point? No, the notation indicates the vertex is the middle letter. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is not between DC and CA, but between DC and another segment? Wait, the problem states Angle(D,C,A), which would imply the two segments are CD and CA, meeting at C. Therefore, forming a straight line if D, C, A are collinear. Hence, angle DCA should be 180 degrees. But it's given as 148. Therefore, there's an inconsistency here. 

But since the problem gives this as a predicate, I have to work with it. Maybe there's a different interpretation. Let me think. Could it be that the angle is not formed by the straight line? Like, if D, C, A are collinear, but there's another point or construction making an angle at C? For example, if there's a triangle or another figure involving these points?

Wait, the other predicates mention angles at A and B. Let me note them again:

- MeasureOf(Angle(A)) = 2x - 15
- MeasureOf(Angle(B)) = x - 5

Assuming Angle(A) is the angle at point A, and similarly for Angle(B). Now, considering that point A lies on line BC (from PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(B, C))), so line BC contains point A. So, triangle ABC is formed with vertices A, B, C. But point A is on line BC, so triangle ABC would degenerate into a straight line? Wait, that can't be. Wait, if A is on line BC, then points A, B, C are colinear, making angle ABC undefined because it would be a straight line. But that contradicts the presence of Angle(B) and Angle(A) as given. So there must be more to the configuration.

Ah! Wait, perhaps the triangle is not ABC but another triangle. Let me consider that. Given that point A is on line BC, but there's also point D collinear with C and A. So maybe there's a triangle involving D? For example, triangle DBC or something else. But without more info, it's hard to tell. 

Alternatively, perhaps the diagram includes multiple triangles. Let me try to reconstruct the scenario.

We have line BC, with point A lying on it (PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(B, C))). Also, points D, C, A are collinear, so D is on line BC as well. So line BC has points B, C, A, D in some order. Now, angle DCA is mentioned, which is at point C between D and A. But since D, C, A are collinear, this angle should be 180°, but it's given as 148°. Therefore, there must be a different interpretation.

Wait, maybe angle DCA is not between DC and CA, but between DC and another line? Or perhaps the angle is part of a triangle where C is connected to another point? Wait, but the angle is specified as D,C,A, so the sides are CD and CA. If those are collinear, then the angle is straight. Therefore, this suggests that my initial assumption about the collinearity is incorrect. 

Wait, the predicate says Collinear(D, C, A). So D, C, A are on the same line. So, if I imagine line l containing points D, C, A. Then, angle DCA is formed at point C, with one side going to D and the other to A. But since they're collinear, that angle is 180°, conflicting with the given 148°. 

Therefore, there must be a misinterpretation. Let me check if the angle is actually at point A. If the angle were at point A, then it would be angle DAC, but the notation is Angle(D,C,A), which should be at C. 

Wait, unless there's a typo in the notation. Maybe it's supposed to be Angle(C,D,A), which would be at D? No, that doesn't fit. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is not between DC and CA, but between CD and another segment. Wait, but the notation specifies three points: D, C, A, so it's definitely angle at C. 

This seems like a dead end. Maybe I need to proceed despite the contradiction, assuming that there's a typo or misunderstanding. Let's assume that angle DCA is indeed 148°, and proceed with that. 

Given that, let's consider the rest of the problem. We have angles at A and B given in terms of x. Also, the collinearity of D, C, A. 

Since point A is on line BC, and D is also on line BC (because D, C, A are collinear), then line BC is the same as line DA. So, points B, C, A, D are all on the same line. 

Now, looking at angle DCA = 148°, which is at point C between D and A. But since D, C, A are collinear, this angle should be 180°, so maybe the actual angle is supplementary to some other angle? Wait, maybe there's another line forming an angle at C? For example, if there's a line from C to another point, say, B? 

Wait, if we consider triangle ABC, but point A is on line BC. So, if we have point B, C, A on a straight line, then angle ABC would be a straight angle, but that conflicts with the given measure of angle B as x-5. 

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem involves a triangle where point A is not on the line BC, but the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(B, C)), which would mean A is on line BC. Therefore, angle ABC would be a straight angle, but the problem gives a measure for angle B as x-5. So this suggests that angle B is not part of triangle ABC, but another triangle? 

Alternatively, maybe the triangle is not ABC, but another triangle. For example, triangle DBC or something else. 

Wait, given that angle DCA is 148°, and points D, C, A are collinear, maybe there's a transversal or another line creating an angle at C. For instance, if there's a line from C to B, forming angle BCD or something. 

Wait, suppose line CB is drawn, connecting point C to point B. Then, at point C, we have line CB and line CD (since D is on line BC). Wait, if D is on line BC, then CD is part of line BC. So, if we have line CB, and line CD (which is the same as CB extended?), then angle DCA is formed by CD and CA. But since D, C, A are collinear, CD and CA are in opposite directions. So, angle DCA would be a straight angle. 

Unless there's another line from C to some other point, forming an angle. For example, if there's a line from C to another point E, forming angle DCE, but that's not mentioned in the problem. 

Wait, maybe the angle DCA is not part of the straight line. Maybe the points are not in the order D-C-A, but in a different order. For example, if the collinearity is such that C is between D and A, but then angle DCA is still a straight angle. 

I'm stuck here. Let me try to set aside the contradiction and see if I can find relations between the angles given. 

We have two expressions involving x: MeasureOf(Angle(A)) = 2x - 15 and MeasureOf(Angle(B)) = x - 5. These likely refer to angles at points A and B, respectively. 

If I can relate these angles to the given angle DCA = 148°, perhaps through some geometric relationship. 

Since points D, C, A are collinear, and point A is on line BC, then line BC contains points B, C, A, D. So, line BC extends through C to D and A. 

Now, if we consider triangle ABC, but since A is on BC, it's degenerate. So, perhaps there's another triangle involved. 

Wait, maybe the angle at A (Angle(A)) refers to angle BAC? But if A is on line BC, then angle BAC would be zero. Not helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe Angle(A) refers to an angle at A formed by other lines. For example, if there's a line from A to D, forming angle BAD or something. 

But without knowing the full diagram, it's challenging. Let me consider that angle DCA is 148°, which is given. If I assume that angle DCA is formed by line CD and line CA, but since they're collinear, that's a straight line. But maybe the angle is actually referring to an external angle or something else. 

Wait, maybe the angle is not between DC and CA, but between DC and another line. For instance, if there's a line from C to B, making angle BCD. But then angle BCD would be part of the straight line. 

Wait, if I consider that line BC goes through C and extends to D and A. So, if I draw line CB, then angle at C between DC and CB would be... Well, if D is on line BC, then DC is part of line BC. So, angle between DC and CB at point C would be 180° minus the angle between CB and CA. Wait, this is getting too vague. 

Maybe I need to focus on the equations. 

We have two expressions involving x: 

MeasureOf(Angle(A)) = 2x - 15  
MeasureOf(Angle(B)) = x - 5  

And we know that angle DCA is 148°. 

If I can express angle DCA in terms of other angles involving x, maybe I can solve for x. 

Assuming that angle DCA relates to angles at A and B somehow. For example, if there's a triangle where angle at C is supplementary to angle DCA. 

Alternatively, since points D, C, A are collinear, and A is on line BC, then line BC passes through A and C. So, if I consider triangle ABC, but since A is on BC, it's degenerate. 

Wait, but if there's a triangle involving point D? For example, triangle DBC? 

In triangle DBC, angle at C is angle DCB, which might be related to angle DCA. Since D, C, A are collinear, and A is on BC, then angle DCB would be a straight angle. But that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, if there's a triangle with point D and another point. 

This is really confusing. Maybe the key is to realize that angle DCA is an exterior angle for some triangle, allowing us to use the exterior angle theorem. 

For example, if there's a triangle where angle DCA is an exterior angle. Let's assume that. If angle DCA is an exterior angle, then it equals the sum of the remote interior angles. 

Suppose angle DCA is an exterior angle for triangle ABC. Then, angle DCA = angle A + angle B. 

If that's the case, then:

148 = (2x - 15) + (x - 5)  
148 = 3x - 20  
3x = 168  
x = 56  

Then, measure of angle B is x - 5 = 56 - 5 = 51 degrees. 

But wait, angle B is asked for? The question is to find m∠ABC. So if angle B is angle ABC, then the answer would be 51, which is option B. 

But how do we know that angle DCA is an exterior angle for triangle ABC? Let's verify. 

If point D is on line BC extended beyond C, then angle DCA would be an exterior angle. For example, if D is on the extension of BC beyond C, then angle DCA is outside the triangle ABC. 

But earlier, we had that points D, C, A are collinear, and point A is on line BC. So if D is on the same line BC as A and C, then depending on the position of D relative to C and A, angle DCA could be an exterior angle. 

For instance, if D is on the extension of BC beyond C, then line CD is extending from C away from B, and CA is towards A. So, angle between CD and CA would be the exterior angle at C. 

In that case, angle DCA is indeed an exterior angle, equal to the sum of the remote interior angles, which would be angles at A and B of triangle ABC. 

Thus, setting up the equation:

angle DCA = angle A + angle B  
148 = (2x - 15) + (x - 5)  
148 = 3x - 20  
3x = 168  
x = 56  

Then, measure of angle B is x - 5 = 51 degrees. So the measure of ∠ABC is 51°, which corresponds to option B. 

But I need to confirm whether angle DCA is indeed the exterior angle. Let me think again. 

If D is on the line BC extended beyond C, then angle DCA is formed by DC and CA. Since DC is extending from C away from B, and CA is going towards A, which is on BC. So, the angle between DC and CA would be the exterior angle at C. Thus, it would equal the sum of the remote interior angles, which are angles at A and B of triangle ABC. 

Yes, that makes sense. So even though D, C, A are collinear, the position of D determines that angle DCA is an exterior angle. 

Therefore, solving for x gives x=56, leading to angle B being 51°, which is option B. 

So the answer should be B.
