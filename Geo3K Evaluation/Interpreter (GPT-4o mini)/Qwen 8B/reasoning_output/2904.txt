MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse the given predicates. The problem states that there's a triangle with points A, B, and C. So Triangle(A, B, C) means we have a triangle connecting these three points. Then there's a RightAngle predicate: RightAngle(Angle(C, A, B)). That tells me that the angle at point A between points C and B is a right angle. Wait, no—wait, the Angle(C, A, B) would mean the angle at point A formed by points C, A, B. So vertex at A, with sides AC and AB. Therefore, the right angle is at point A. 

Next, the LengthOf(Line(C, A)) is 5. So the length between points C and A is 5 units. Then LengthOf(Line(A, B)) is 12. So the distance between A and B is 12 units. The question asks to use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the hypotenuse of the right triangle. 

Since it's a right triangle with the right angle at A, the legs are AC and AB. Their lengths are 5 and 12 respectively. The hypotenuse would be the side opposite the right angle, which is BC. So applying the Pythagorean Theorem: hypotenuse squared equals sum of squares of the legs. So BC² = AC² + AB². Plugging in the numbers: BC² = 5² + 12² = 25 + 144 = 169. Taking the square root gives BC = √169 = 13. 

Looking at the answer choices, D is 13. So the correct answer should be D. Let me double-check. The right angle is at A, so sides AC and AB are the legs. Yes, those are 5 and 12. Hypotenuse is BC. Calculation seems correct. Yep, 5-12-13 is a classic Pythagorean triple. So the answer is D.
