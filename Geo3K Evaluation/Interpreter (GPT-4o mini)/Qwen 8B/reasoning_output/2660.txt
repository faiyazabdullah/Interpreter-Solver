MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have points A, B, and C. The given predicates are that angle at B is a right angle, the length of AC is 22 units, AB is 13 units, and BC is x units. We need to find x.

First, I should visualize the triangle. Since there's a right angle at B, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at B. That means sides AB and BC are the legs, and AC is the hypotenuse. Wait, but wait—AC is given as 22. Let me confirm: in a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. Since the right angle is at B, the hypotenuse would be AC. So yes, AC is the hypotenuse. Therefore, AB and BC are the two legs.

Given that AB is 13 units, BC is x units, and AC is 22 units. Using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So, AB² + BC² = AC². Plugging in the numbers: 13² + x² = 22². 

Calculating 13 squared: 13*13 is 169. 22 squared is 484. So, substituting, 169 + x² = 484. Then subtract 169 from both sides: x² = 484 - 169. Let me compute that. 484 minus 160 is 324, then minus 9 more is 315. So x² = 315. Taking the square root of both sides gives x = sqrt(315). Now, simplifying sqrt(315). Let's factor 315. Dividing by 5 first: 315 ÷ 5 = 63. Then 63 factors into 9*7. So sqrt(315) = sqrt(9*7*5) = 3*sqrt(35). Therefore, x = 3√35. Looking at the answer choices, option C is 3√35. So the correct answer should be C.
