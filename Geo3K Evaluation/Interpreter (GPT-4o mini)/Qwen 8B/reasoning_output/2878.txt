MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question says that angle 1 and angle 2 form a linear pair, and the measure of angle 2 is 67 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle 1. 

First, I remember that a linear pair consists of two adjacent angles whose non-common sides form a straight line. That means the two angles are supplementary, right? Because they add up to 180 degrees. Wait, yes, because a straight line is 180 degrees, so if two angles make a straight line together, their measures should sum to 180.

So, if angle 1 and angle 2 are a linear pair, then m∠1 + m∠2 = 180°. They gave us that m∠2 is 67°, so we can plug that in. Let me write that out: m∠1 + 67° = 180°. To find m∠1, subtract 67° from both sides. That would be 180° - 67°, which equals... let me calculate that. 180 minus 60 is 120, and then minus 7 more is 113. So, m∠1 should be 113 degrees.

Looking at the answer choices, B is 113. So the answer should be B. But wait, let me double-check. Are there any other factors here? The problem mentions some predicates like Line(A,B), Line(C,D), and points A, B, C, D. But the question is about angles forming a linear pair. Maybe those predicates are just setting up the diagram but the core concept is still the same. Since they form a linear pair, regardless of the specific points, the relationship holds. So yeah, the calculation seems straightforward. No need to overcomplicate with the given points unless there's something missing. But since the problem directly states it's a linear pair, the answer should be 180 - 67 = 113. Therefore, choice B.
