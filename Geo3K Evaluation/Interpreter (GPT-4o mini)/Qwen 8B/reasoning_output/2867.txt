Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given information and figure out how the different elements relate to each other. 

So, the problem says that points A, C, D, F, G lie on circle B. Also, lines BC, BD, BF, BG are radii of the circle. That means points C, D, F, G are all on the circumference since they're endpoints of radii. Wait, but the circle is named after point B, so maybe B is the center? Because radii go from the center to the circumference. So if Line(B,C) is a radius, then B is the center of the circle. Therefore, points C, D, F, G are all on the circle, and B is the center. 

Then, there are two angle measures given: measure of angle FBD is 55 degrees, and measure of angle FBG is 35 degrees. The question asks for the measure of arc AG. Since we're dealing with a circle, arcs correspond to central angles. So, the measure of an arc is equal to the measure of its central angle. 

Wait, the problem states that AD and CG are diameters. Oh, wait, the original statement says "A D and C G are diameters of ⊙B". Hmm, maybe it's supposed to be "AD and CG are diameters"? Let me check again. The user wrote: "A D and C G are diameters of ⊙ B." Maybe that's a typo, perhaps it should be "AD and CG are diameters"? Because otherwise, if A and D are diameters, that doesn't make sense because diameters are lines, not points. So probably, AD and CG are diameters. So AD is a diameter, meaning points A and D are at opposite ends of the circle. Similarly, CG is a diameter, so points C and G are also endpoints of a diameter. 

Since B is the center, then the diameter AD would mean that B is the midpoint of AD. Similarly, CG being a diameter implies that B is the midpoint of CG. 

Now, since AD is a diameter, then angle ABD would be a right angle? No, wait, if AD is a diameter, then any angle subtended by AD would be a right angle if it's an inscribed angle. But here, we have points on the circle. Let me think again. 

First, let me note down all the given information:

- Points A, C, D, F, G are on circle B (so they are on the circumference).
- Lines BC, BD, BF, BG are radii. Hence, B is the center of the circle. 
- Angles: ∠FBD = 55°, ∠FBG = 35°. 
- AD and CG are diameters. 

So, since AD is a diameter, then points A and D are endpoints of a diameter. Similarly, CG is a diameter, so points C and G are endpoints of another diameter. 

Given that, since B is the center, the coordinates of these points would be such that BA = BD = BF = BG, since they are radii. 

Let me try to visualize this. Let me sketch mentally:

- Center at B.
- Point C is one end of a radius, so connected to B. Similarly for D, F, G. 
- AD is a diameter, so A and D are on opposite sides of B. So vector from B to A is opposite to vector from B to D. Similarly, CG is a diameter, so C and G are opposite each other. 

Now, looking at angles given: ∠FBD = 55°, ∠FBG = 35°. These angles are at point B, so they are central angles. Because B is the center. So, the measure of angle FBD corresponds to the arc FD, and angle FBG corresponds to arc FG. 

But since ∠FBD is 55°, the arc FD would be 55°, and ∠FBG is 35°, so arc FG is 35°. 

Wait, but since CG is a diameter, point G is directly opposite to point C. So the arc from C to G would be 180°, as it's a diameter. 

Also, AD is a diameter, so arc from A to D is 180°. 

We need to find the measure of arc AG. 

Let me try to find where points A, G are located. 

Since AD is a diameter, moving from A to D through the circle. Let me consider the positions of other points. 

Points C and G are endpoints of a diameter, so G is opposite to C. So, starting from point C, going halfway around the circle to G. 

Similarly, point F is somewhere on the circle, connected to B via radius BF. 

Given that angle FBD is 55°, which is the central angle between points F and D. So, the arc from F to D is 55°, so arc FD = 55°. Similarly, angle FBG is 35°, so arc FG = 35°. 

Now, since CG is a diameter, arc CG is 180°, so from C to G is half the circle. 

Let me try to see how these arcs connect. 

Starting from point F, moving to D (arc FD = 55°). Then, from D to A is part of the diameter AD. Since AD is a diameter, arc DA is 180°, so from D to A is 180°. 

But we need to find arc AG. Let me think about the position of point G. Since CG is a diameter, point G is directly opposite to C. So, if I can express the position of G relative to other points. 

Alternatively, maybe we can find the total arc from A to G by adding up some arcs. 

Let me think step by step. 

First, since angle FBD is 55°, that is, the arc from F to D is 55°. So, arc FD = 55°. 

Angle FBG is 35°, which is the central angle between F and G, so arc FG = 35°. 

Therefore, the arc from F to G is 35°, and from F to D is 55°. So, the difference between these arcs could give us something. 

But how does this relate to point G and point A?

Since AD is a diameter, moving from A to D is 180°, so arc AD = 180°. 

Suppose we can find the arc from A to G. Let me consider the entire circle as 360°, so summing up arcs. 

But I need to find arc AG. Let me see. 

Let me first consider the positions of points. Let's assume the circle is labeled with points in order. Let me try to imagine the circle with center B. Let me place point F somewhere, then points D and G are positioned such that angles FBD and FBG are given. 

Alternatively, since B is the center, let me think in terms of coordinates. Suppose we assign coordinates to simplify. Let me set B at the origin (0,0). Let me assume the circle has radius r. 

But maybe coordinates complicate things. Alternatively, use angles. 

Since arc FD is 55°, and arc FG is 35°, then the angle between D and G from point F is... Well, the arc from D to G would be arc DG = arc DF + arc FG? Or depends on direction. 

Wait, if arc FD is 55°, then from F to D is 55°, and from F to G is 35°, so depending on whether G is on one side or the other. 

Assuming that all points are arranged in a certain way. For example, suppose we start at point F, then move 55° towards D, and 35° towards G. Depending on the direction, but since angles at B are measured, we can think in terms of directions. 

Alternatively, since points C and G form a diameter, then point G is opposite to C. So, if I can find the position of C relative to other points. 

Wait, but I don't know where point C is. However, since BD is a radius, and AD is a diameter, so D is the endpoint of the diameter AD. So, if I can relate points D and G. 

Alternatively, since AD is a diameter, then the arc from A to D is 180°, so if I can find the relationship between arc AG and other arcs. 

Let me think about the total circle. Let me consider the arcs involving points A, G, and others. 

Since arc FG is 35°, and arc FD is 55°, then if I can find the arc from D to G, which would be arc DG. Since arc FD is 55°, and arc FG is 35°, then arc DG would be arc DF + arc FG if they are adjacent. Wait, but that depends on the direction. 

For instance, if we have points F, D, and G arranged such that moving from F to D is 55°, and from F to G is 35°, then the arc from D to G would be arc DG = arc DF + arc FG if G is in the same direction from F as D. But that may not necessarily be the case. 

Alternatively, since the angles at B are given, the arcs are determined by those angles. So, for example, angle FBD is the central angle between points F and D, which is 55°, so arc FD is 55°. Similarly, angle FBG is the central angle between F and G, so arc FG is 35°. 

Thus, the arc from D to G would be arc DG = arc DF + arc FG if points F, D, G are placed in order. But that depends on the arrangement. 

Alternatively, since arc FG is 35°, and arc FD is 55°, the difference between them is 55° - 35° = 20°, which could be arc DG if they are overlapping. But without knowing the exact positions, this is tricky. 

Wait, but since AD is a diameter, and CG is a diameter, perhaps we can find some relations. 

Let me think about point G. Since CG is a diameter, then G is directly opposite to C. So, if I can find where C is. 

But point C is connected to B via radius BC, so point C is on the circle. 

Hmm, maybe I need to find the arc from A to G by considering other arcs. 

Let me try to find the measure of arc AG. To do that, perhaps I can find the total arc from A to G by breaking it into parts. 

Since AD is a diameter, arc AD is 180°, so from A to D is 180°. 

If I can find the arc from D to G, then add it to arc DA (but that might not be helpful). Alternatively, find arc from A to G by going through other points. 

Alternatively, since arc FG is 35°, and arc FD is 55°, then maybe there's a relation between arc DG and other arcs. 

Wait, if arc FD is 55°, and arc FG is 35°, then the arc from D to G would be arc DG = arc DF + arc FG if points F, D, G are in order. But if that's the case, then arc DG = 55° + 35° = 90°. 

But then, since AD is a diameter, arc AD is 180°, so from A to D is 180°. So, if I can find the arc from D to G (which is 90°), then the arc from A to G would be arc AD (180°) minus arc DG (90°)? Wait, no. Because if you go from A to D (180°), then from D to G (another 90°), that would make arc AG = arc AD + arc DG? Wait, no, that would depend on the direction. 

Wait, arc AG could be either the shorter arc or longer arc, but usually in such problems, it refers to the minor arc unless specified. 

Alternatively, maybe I can find the position of G relative to A. 

Another approach: since CG is a diameter, then point G is directly opposite to C. Let me consider the arc from C to G is 180°, so arc CG = 180°. 

But how does point C relate to other points? 

We know that BD is a radius, so point D is on the circle. 

Also, since AD is a diameter, point A is directly opposite to D. So, the arc from A to D is 180°, so if I can find where point G is in relation to A. 

Alternatively, maybe we can find the measure of arc AG by considering the angles given. 

Let me try to look at the entire circle. The total circumference is 360°. 

If I can find the measure of arc AG, maybe by subtracting other arcs. 

Let me consider the arcs we know:

Arc FG = 35°, arc FD = 55°, arc CG = 180°, arc AD = 180°. 

But how do these relate to arc AG?

Perhaps I need to find the position of point G with respect to other points. 

Let me try to imagine starting at point F. From F, moving 55° to D, and 35° to G. So, if we take the angle between FD and FG, which is the angle between D and G from point F. Wait, but since both are from point B, which is the center. 

Wait, angle between FD and FG would be angle DFG? No, at point B, the angles are between the radii. 

Wait, angle FBD is 55°, which is the angle between BF and BD. Angle FBG is 35°, which is the angle between BF and BG. So, the angle between BD and BG is angle DBG = angle FBD + angle FBG = 55° + 35° = 90°. 

So, the angle between BD and BG is 90°, which means that arc DG is 90°, since it's a central angle. 

Ah! So, the arc DG is 90°, because the central angle between D and G is 90°. 

So, arc DG = 90°. 

Now, since AD is a diameter, arc AD is 180°, so from A to D is 180°. Now, if I can find the arc from A to G, which would be arc AG. 

To find arc AG, perhaps we can consider the arc from A to D (180°) plus arc from D to G (90°), but that would be arc AG if they are in the same direction. However, since arc AD is from A to D, and arc DG is from D to G, then combining them gives arc AG. But that would be 180° + 90° = 270°, which is more than half the circle, so the minor arc AG would be the smaller one, which would be 360° - 270° = 90°, but that seems conflicting. 

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. 

If arc DG is 90°, and arc AD is 180°, then depending on the position of G relative to A, the arc AG could be computed. 

Alternatively, since arc AD is 180°, and arc DG is 90°, then from A to D to G is 180° + 90° = 270°, which would imply that the arc from A to G passing through D is 270°, making the minor arc AG the remaining 90°. 

Wait, but that would mean arc AG is 90°, which isn't among the options. Wait, the answer choices are 35, 40, 45, 55. Hmm. So maybe my assumption is wrong. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Since arc DG is 90°, and arc CG is 180°, which is the diameter. 

Point G is on the circle, and since CG is a diameter, point C is opposite to G. So, if I can find the position of C relative to other points. 

But we also have that BD is a radius, so point D is on the circle. 

Wait, but how does point C relate to other points? 

Alternatively, since arc DG is 90°, and arc CG is 180°, then arc CD is arc CG - arc DG = 180° - 90° = 90°. So arc CD is 90°. 

Now, if I can find arc AD (which is 180°), and arc CD is 90°, then arc AC would be arc AD - arc CD = 180° - 90° = 90°. 

But how does that help with arc AG? 

Alternatively, since arc CD is 90°, and arc CG is 180°, then point C is 90° away from D along the arc. 

But I still need to connect this to point A. 

Let me think differently. Since AD is a diameter, then point A is directly opposite to D. So, if I can find the arc from A to G, which is equivalent to arc AG. 

Let me try to find the total arc from A to G by considering the positions. 

From point A, going through the circle to G. 

If I can find the arc from A to D (which is 180°), then from D to G is 90°, so total arc from A to G would be 180° + 90° = 270°, but since we want the minor arc AG, that would be 360° - 270° = 90°, but again, that's not matching the answer choices. 

Wait, but maybe there's another way. Since arc FG is 35°, and arc FD is 55°, then arc DG is 90°, as before. Also, since CG is a diameter, arc CG is 180°. 

If I can find the position of point G relative to point A. 

Alternatively, consider the arc from A to G. Let me think about the entire circle. 

Total circle is 360°. 

If I can find the arcs that compose the rest of the circle except for arc AG. 

But without knowing other arcs, this might not help. 

Wait, but since we have arc FG = 35°, arc FD = 55°, arc DG = 90°, arc CG = 180°, and arc AD = 180°, maybe there's a way to link them. 

Alternatively, since arc DG is 90°, and arc CG is 180°, then arc DC is 90°, as mentioned earlier. 

Then, since arc AD is 180°, and arc DC is 90°, then arc AC is arc AD - arc DC = 180° - 90° = 90°. So arc AC is 90°. 

Now, if I can find arc AG, perhaps by relating it to arc AC. 

But how? 

Wait, point G is on the circle, and point C is on the circle. Since CG is a diameter, point G is opposite to C. So, if I can find the arc from A to C (which is 90°), and then from C to G is 180°, then arc AG would be arc AC + arc CG? But that would be 90° + 180° = 270°, which again suggests the minor arc AG is 90°, but that's not an option. 

Hmm, this suggests I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the problem. 

Wait, the question is asking for the measure of arc AG. But maybe I made a mistake in assuming that arc DG is 90°. Let me verify that. 

Earlier, I said that angle between BD and BG is 55° + 35° = 90°, hence arc DG is 90°. Is that correct? 

Yes, because angle FBD is 55°, which is the angle between BF and BD, and angle FBG is 35°, which is the angle between BF and BG. So, the angle between BD and BG is angle DBG = angle FBD + angle FBG = 55° + 35° = 90°, which is the central angle between D and G. Thus, arc DG is indeed 90°. 

So arc DG is 90°, arc AD is 180°, arc CG is 180°, arc CD is 90°, arc AC is 90°, etc. 

But how to get arc AG? 

Maybe I need to consider the position of point A relative to point G. 

Since AD is a diameter, and CG is a diameter, then points A and D are opposites, points C and G are opposites. 

Let me imagine the circle with center B. Let me draw this mentally. 

Start with center B. Let me place point D somewhere on the circle. Then, since AD is a diameter, point A is directly opposite to D. 

Point C is somewhere on the circle, and G is the opposite of C. 

Now, from point F, we have angles of 55° and 35° leading to points D and G. 

So, if I can find the position of point G relative to point A. 

Let me consider the arc from A to G. 

If I can find the arc from A to G by going through other points. 

For example, arc AG could be arc AC + arc CG. Arc AC is 90°, arc CG is 180°, totaling 270°, which is not helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe arc AG is arc AF + arc FG. But I don't know arc AF. 

Wait, arc FG is 35°, so if I can find arc AF. 

But how? 

Alternatively, since arc FD is 55°, and arc AD is 180°, then arc AF would be arc AD - arc FD = 180° - 55° = 125°. 

So arc AF is 125°, arc FG is 35°, so arc AG would be arc AF + arc FG = 125° + 35° = 160°. But that's not an option either. 

Wait, but that assumes that points A, F, G are in order, which may not be the case. 

Alternatively, if arc AG is the difference between arc AF and arc FG. 

This is getting too confusing. Perhaps I need to use another approach. 

Let me consider that arc DG is 90°, and arc AD is 180°. So, from point D to G is 90°, and from A to D is 180°. So, if I go from A to D to G, that's 180° + 90° = 270°, which is three-quarters of the circle. So, the arc AG going the long way is 270°, so the minor arc AG is 360° - 270° = 90°. 

But 90° isn't an option. The options are 35, 40, 45, 55. So this suggests I'm missing something. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the arc AG is the complement of 270°. Let me double-check. 

If the major arc AG is 270°, then the minor arc AG is 90°, but none of the options is 90°. This is conflicting. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that arc AG is composed of other arcs. 

Let me think about the positions of points A, G, and others. 

Since AD is a diameter, and CG is a diameter. So, if I can find the angle between A and G with respect to the center. 

Alternatively, since arc DG is 90°, and arc CG is 180°, then arc DC is 90°, as before. And arc AD is 180°, so arc AC is 90°. 

Now, arc AC is 90°, and arc CG is 180°, so arc AG is arc AC + arc CG? No, because point C is on the arc from A to G? 

Wait, if arc AC is 90°, and arc CG is 180°, then from A to C to G would be 90° + 180° = 270°, which again leads to the conclusion that arc AG is 270°, implying the minor arc is 90°, which is not an option. 

But the answer choices don't include 90°, so there must be an error in my reasoning. 

Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. 

The problem says: "A D and C G are diameters of ⊙ B." Maybe it's supposed to say "AD and CG are diameters", which would make more sense. Assuming that, then AD is a diameter, so points A and D are endpoints. CG is a diameter, so points C and G are endpoints. 

Let me try to think of the circle with center B. Let me assume that point A is at some position, D is directly opposite. Point C is at another position, and G is directly opposite to C. 

Now, given that, and the angles at B: ∠FBD = 55°, ∠FBG = 35°. 

Let me consider the positions of F. Since BF is a radius, point F is somewhere on the circle. 

Now, the angle between BF and BD is 55°, so from point B, the angle between BF and BD is 55°, which means that arc FD is 55°. Similarly, the angle between BF and BG is 35°, so arc FG is 35°. 

Now, since arc DG is the difference between arc DF and arc FG, but depending on the direction. If we consider that from point F, moving toward D is 55°, and toward G is 35°, then the angle between D and G is 55° - 35° = 20°? Or is it 55° + 35° = 90°? 

Wait, if both angles are measured from the same ray BF, then the angle between BD and BG is the sum of the two angles. So, if angle FBD is 55°, and angle FBG is 35°, then the angle between BD and BG is 55° + 35° = 90°, which makes arc DG = 90°, as previously thought. 

So, arc DG is 90°, arc CG is 180°, so arc DC is 180° - 90° = 90°. 

Now, since AD is a diameter, arc AD is 180°, and arc DC is 90°, then arc AC is arc AD - arc DC = 180° - 90° = 90°. 

So, arc AC is 90°, and arc CG is 180°, so arc AG is arc AC + arc CG? Wait, no, because if you go from A to C to G, that's arc AC (90°) plus arc CG (180°), which totals 270°, but that's the major arc. The minor arc AG would be 360° - 270° = 90°. 

Again, this leads to arc AG being 90°, which is not an option. 

Hmm, this suggests there's a mistake in the logic. Let me think of another approach. 

Maybe I need to consider the positions of points A and G relative to other points. 

Since AD is a diameter, point A is opposite to D. Point G is opposite to C. 

If I can find the position of point C relative to D, then I can find the position of G. 

Earlier, we found arc DC is 90°, so arc from D to C is 90°. 

So, if arc DC is 90°, and arc AD is 180°, then arc AC is 180° - 90° = 90°. 

Now, since arc AC is 90°, and arc CG is 180°, then arc AG is arc AC + arc CG = 90° + 180° = 270°, but again, this is the major arc. 

Wait, but maybe the arc AG is just arc AC plus arc CG, but since C and G are on opposite sides, it's not additive. 

Alternatively, maybe arc AG is arc AC plus arc CG minus something? 

Wait, this seems stuck. Let me think about the angles given. 

We know ∠FBD = 55°, ∠FBG = 35°, and arc DG = 90°. 

If I can find the position of point A relative to these points. 

Since AD is a diameter, point A is opposite to D. So, if I can find the arc from A to G, it would be the arc from A to D (180°) plus arc from D to G (90°), but that would be 270°, which is the major arc. So the minor arc AG is 360° - 270° = 90°. 

Still not matching. 

Wait, but the answer choices don't have 90°. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read the question again. 

"Find m∠AG." Wait, the question says "m∠AG", but in the initial prompt, it was written as "m \widehat A G", which is the measure of arc AG. 

Wait, maybe I've been thinking of arc AG instead of the angle AG. But no, the question says "m \widehat A G", which is arc AG. 

But the answer choices are 35, 40, 45, 55. None of which are 90. So this suggests that my previous reasoning is incorrect. 

Let me try to think differently. Perhaps I made a mistake in calculating arc DG. 

Let me reconsider the angle at B. 

We have angle FBD = 55°, which is the central angle between points F and D, so arc FD = 55°. 

Angle FBG = 35°, which is the central angle between points F and G, so arc FG = 35°. 

So, the angle between points D and G is the difference between arc FD and arc FG? Or is it the sum? 

If points F, D, G are arranged such that from F, moving to D is 55°, and from F, moving to G is 35°, then the angle between D and G would depend on the direction. 

For example, if both arcs are in the same direction, then the arc from D to G would be 55° - 35° = 20°, or if they are in opposite directions, it would be 55° + 35° = 90°. 

But how do we know which direction? 

Since angle FBD and angle FBG are both measured from the same ray BF, the angle between BD and BG is the sum of the two angles, which is 55° + 35° = 90°, so arc DG is 90°. 

That part seems correct. 

So, arc DG = 90°, arc AD = 180°, so if I can find arc AG, which is from A to G. 

Since AD is a diameter, point A is opposite to D. So, if I can find the arc from A to G, it would be arc AD (180°) plus arc DG (90°), but that's the major arc. 

Wait, but maybe there's another way. Let's consider that arc AG is equal to arc AF + arc FG. 

But I don't know arc AF. 

But arc AF can be calculated as arc AD - arc DF. Since arc AD is 180°, and arc DF is 55°, then arc AF = 180° - 55° = 125°. 

So arc AF = 125°, arc FG = 35°, so arc AG = arc AF + arc FG = 125° + 35° = 160°, but this is not an option. 

Alternatively, if arc AG is arc AF - arc FG = 125° - 35° = 90°, which again is not an option. 

This suggests that there's a fundamental flaw in my understanding. 

Wait, let me try to think of the circle divided into sections. 

We have arc FG = 35°, arc FD = 55°, arc DG = 90°. 

Let me add these up: 35 + 55 + 90 = 180°. So these three arcs together make 180°. 

What does this represent? It represents the arcs from F to G (35°), from F to D (55°), and from D to G (90°). This seems like it covers the area around point F. 

But how does this help with arc AG? 

Maybe I need to consider the remaining arcs. 

Total circle is 360°. We have 180° accounted for, so remaining is 180°. 

These remaining arcs would be the ones not covered by FG, FD, DG. 

But this is vague. 

Alternatively, since arc DG is 90°, and arc CG is 180°, then arc DC is 90°. 

And arc AD is 180°, so arc AC is 90°, as before. 

Now, if arc AC is 90°, and arc CG is 180°, then arc AG is arc AC + arc CG? No, because point C is between A and G? 

Wait, if arc AC is 90°, and arc CG is 180°, then from A to C to G is 90° + 180° = 270°, so the arc AG would be 270°, but the minor arc is 90°. 

But again, no option for 90°. 

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the measure of angle AG, not arc AG? But the question says "m \widehat A G", which is arc AG. 

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the diagram. Let me try to imagine the circle with center B, and points A, C, D, F, G on the circumference. 

Since AD is a diameter, and CG is a diameter. Let me assume the circle is divided into several arcs. 

Let me consider that arc FG = 35°, arc FD = 55°, and arc DG = 90°. 

If I can find the position of point A. Since AD is a diameter, and arc AD is 180°, then if I can find where A is relative to other points. 

Let me assume that point F is somewhere on the circle, and from there, arc FD is 55°, and arc FG is 35°. 

Let me try to construct the circle step by step. 

Start with center B. Let me place point F at some position. From F, moving 55° along the circle to point D, and 35° along the circle to point G. 

So, the angle between FD and FG is 55° - 35° = 20°, or 55° + 35° = 90°, depending on the direction. 

Since the angle at B between BD and BG is 90°, as calculated earlier, the arc DG is 90°. 

Now, since AD is a diameter, point A is directly opposite to D. So, if I can find the position of A relative to other points. 

Let me imagine that from point D, moving 180° to reach point A. 

Now, I need to find the arc from A to G. 

If I can find the arc from A to G, it would depend on where G is. 

Since arc DG is 90°, and arc AD is 180°, then the arc from A to G would be arc AD + arc DG = 180° + 90° = 270°, which is the major arc. So the minor arc AG is 360° - 270° = 90°. 

But this still doesn't match any options. 

Wait, but maybe there's a different interpretation. Maybe the question is asking for the measure of angle AG, not the arc? But the symbol used is \widehat, which denotes an arc. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to an inscribed angle. 

Wait, if there's an inscribed angle subtended by arc AG, then its measure would be half the arc. 

But the question specifically says "m \widehat A G", which is the measure of the arc. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to revisit the problem and check for any errors in assumptions. 

Let me recheck the given predicates. 

The predicates mention PointLiesOnCircle(A, Circle(B)), so A is on the circle. Same for C, D, F, G. 

IsRadiusOf(Line(B,C), Circle(B)) → BC is a radius, so B is the center. 

Same for BD, BF, BG. 

Angles: MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,D)) = 55°, MeasureOf(Angle(F,B,G)) = 35°. 

So, angle at B between F and D is 55°, and between F and G is 35°. 

So, the angle between D and G is 90°, as before. 

Now, since AD is a diameter, and CG is a diameter, and B is the center. 

Let me try to calculate the measure of arc AG using the fact that it is equal to the central angle. 

But how? 

Let me consider the position of G. Since CG is a diameter, G is opposite to C. 

If I can find the position of C relative to other points. 

But I don't have direct information about C. 

Wait, but since BD is a radius, and AD is a diameter, then point D is on the circle, and point A is the opposite of D. 

If I can find the arc from A to G, perhaps by finding the arc from A to C and then from C to G. 

But how? 

Wait, let me think about the arc from A to C. Since arc AC is 90°, as calculated earlier. And arc CG is 180°, so from C to G is 180°. 

But if I go from A to C to G, that's 90° + 180° = 270°, which is the major arc AG. 

But the minor arc AG is 360° - 270° = 90°, which is not an option. 

Alternatively, maybe the arc AG is 55° + 35° = 90°, but that's the same as before. 

Wait, but the answer choices don't have 90°. This suggests that there's a mistake in the problem or in my reasoning. 

Wait, let me check the answer choices again: 35, 40, 45, 55. 

Maybe the correct answer is 40°, which is not directly obvious. How can I get 40°? 

Wait, let me think about the angle at B between A and G. If I can find that, it would be the central angle for arc AG. 

How to find the angle at B between A and G? 

Since AD is a diameter, and CG is a diameter. 

Let me try to find the angle between BA and BG. 

Point A is on the circle, and G is on the circle. 

BA is a radius, BG is a radius. So, the angle between BA and BG is the central angle between A and G, which is the measure of arc AG. 

So, if I can find the angle between BA and BG, that would give me the measure of arc AG. 

To find this angle, let's see. 

We know the angle between BF and BD is 55°, and between BF and BG is 35°. 

If I can find the angle between BA and BF, and then combine it with the angle between BF and BG. 

But how? 

Since AD is a diameter, and BD is a radius. So, BA is the opposite direction of BD. 

Because AD is a diameter, so BA is in the opposite direction of BD. 

So, if BD is a radius pointing from B to D, then BA is pointing from B to A, which is the opposite direction. 

So, the angle between BA and BD is 180°, since they are opposite directions. 

But we know the angle between BF and BD is 55°, so the angle between BF and BA would be 180° - 55° = 125°. 

Now, the angle between BA and BG is the angle between BA and BF plus the angle between BF and BG, which is 125° + 35° = 160°. 

Wait, but that would mean the central angle between BA and BG is 160°, so arc AG is 160°, which is not an option. 

Alternatively, if the angle between BA and BG is 35° + 55° = 90°, but that would require that the angle between BA and BF is 55°, but I don't know that. 

Wait, let me clarify. 

Since BA is opposite to BD, the angle between BA and BD is 180°. 

If the angle between BF and BD is 55°, then the angle between BF and BA is 180° - 55° = 125°. 

Then, the angle between BF and BG is 35°, so the total angle between BA and BG is 125° + 35° = 160°. 

So, the central angle between A and G is 160°, which is the measure of arc AG. But this is not an option. 

This is very confusing. 

Wait, maybe the angle between BA and BG is 180° - 55° - 35° = 90°? 

No, that would be if the angles were on the same side. 

Alternatively, if the angle between BA and BG is the difference between the angle between BF and BD and the angle between BF and BG. 

But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, since the angle between BA and BD is 180°, and the angle between BF and BD is 55°, then the angle between BA and BF is 180° - 55° = 125°. 

The angle between BF and BG is 35°, so the angle between BA and BG is 125° - 35° = 90°, if they are on the same side. 

Wait, this makes sense. 

Imagine that from point B, the angle between BA and BF is 125°, and between BF and BG is 35°, so the angle between BA and BG is 125° - 35° = 90°. 

Thus, the central angle between A and G is 90°, so arc AG is 90°. 

But again, this is not an option. 

Wait, but the answer choices are 35, 40, 45, 55. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the angle between BA and BG. 

Let me think again: 

Since BA is opposite to BD, the angle between BA and BD is 180°. 

The angle between BF and BD is 55°, so the angle between BF and BA is 180° - 55° = 125°. 

Then, the angle between BF and BG is 35°, so if BG is on the same side as BF relative to BA, then the angle between BA and BG would be 125° - 35° = 90°. 

Alternatively, if BG is on the other side, it would be
