MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand what each one means. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have points J, K, and C. There's also a circle named C. Wait, hold on—the point C is mentioned? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:

Wait, the user wrote:

"Point(J)
Point(K)
Point(C)
PointLiesOnCircle(Point(J),Circle(C))
PointLiesOnCircle(Point(K),Circle(C))
Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,K)),2)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(J,C,K)),30)"

Oh, so there's a circle called C, and points J, K, and another point C? Wait, that seems confusing because the same symbol C is used for both the circle and a point. Maybe it's a typo? Or perhaps the circle is named C, and there's a point also named C? That could be possible. Let me check again.

In the first part, they list:

Point(J)
Point(K)
Point(C) — so there's a point labeled C.

Then, PointLiesOnCircle(Point(J),Circle(C)) — so the circle is named C, and point J lies on that circle. Similarly, point K lies on the same circle. Then, the length of Line(C,K) is 2 units. So, the segment connecting point C and point K has length 2. Also, the measure of angle JCK (since the angle is written as Angle(J,C,K), which would be angle at point C between points J and K) is 30 degrees.

So, putting this together:

- There is a circle with center C? Wait, no—wait, if the circle is named C, but the point is also named C, maybe the circle is centered at point C? Because usually, a circle is defined by its center and radius. But the problem doesn't explicitly say that. However, since points J and K lie on the circle, and the segment CK has length 2, which could be the radius if C is the center.

Wait, let's think carefully. The circle is called Circle(C). In standard notation, a circle is often denoted by its center. For example, Circle(O) would mean a circle with center O. So here, Circle(C) implies the circle has center at point C. Therefore, point C is the center of the circle. Points J and K lie on this circle, so CJ and CK are radii of the circle. 

But wait, the length of Line(C,K) is 2. Since C is the center and K is a point on the circle, then CK is a radius. Therefore, the radius r = 2. So the radius of the circle is 2 units. 

Now, we have angle JCK being 30 degrees. This is the central angle subtended by arc JK. Because angle at the center of the circle between two points on the circumference. 

The question asks for the length of arc JK, which is denoted as $\widehat{JK}$. To find the length of an arc, the formula is:

Arc length = θ × r

where θ is the central angle in radians, and r is the radius.

First, convert the given angle from degrees to radians. The angle is 30 degrees. 

To convert degrees to radians, multiply by π/180. So:

θ_rad = 30° × π/180 = π/6 radians.

Then, the arc length is:

Arc length = π/6 × 2 = π/3 ≈ 1.04719755...

Rounding to the nearest hundredth gives approximately 1.05. 

Looking at the answer choices, option C is 1.05, so that should be the answer.

Let me verify once more. The central angle is 30 degrees, radius is 2. Arc length calculation is correct. Yes, π/3 is about 1.047, rounds to 1.05. So answer C.
