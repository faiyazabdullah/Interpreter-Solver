MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given information and figure out how the different elements relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the given points and lines.

We have points X, Y, Z forming triangle XYZ. Then there's another triangle JKL with points J, K, L. Also, there are several lines connecting these points. Additionally, we know that XP is a line segment from X to J, but wait, actually looking back, the Line(X, J) is mentioned. Wait, the Line(X, J) is part of the given predicates. Also, there's a Line(X, L), so maybe point P is connected to some other points?

Wait, the problem says that in triangle XYZ, P is the centroid. So first, I need to recall that the centroid of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer part being closer to the vertex. 

Given that KP = 3 and XJ = 8. Wait, XJ is a length? The predicate Equals(LengthOf(Line(X,J)), 8) tells us that the length of the line segment from X to J is 8 units. But also, since P is the centroid, perhaps there's a relation between KP and other segments?

Let me try to visualize this. Triangle XYZ has centroid P. Now, there's another triangle JKL. The line segments given include Line(J,K), Line(K,L), Line(J,P), Line(P,L). So J is connected to K, K to L, J to P, and P to L. That forms triangle JKP and JPL? Or maybe triangle JKL with P connected to it somehow? Hmm.

But since P is the centroid of triangle XYZ, perhaps there's a connection between P and other points. For example, if there's a line from X to J, and XJ is 8, and P is the centroid, maybe there's a relationship between the medians of triangle XYZ and the position of P relative to other points.

Wait, the problem mentions that KP = 3. So K is a point connected to J and L, forming triangle JKL. Maybe there's a way to connect triangle JKL with triangle XYZ through point P?

Alternatively, since P is the centroid of XYZ, and there's a line from X to J, which is length 8. Also, there's a line from X to L. Wait, the Line(X, L) exists. So point L is connected to X. And also, Line(Z, K) is present. So maybe points J, K, L form a triangle connected to the main triangle XYZ?

This seems a bit complex. Let me break it down again.

First, the main triangle XYZ with centroid P. Centroid divides each median into 2:1. So if we consider the medians of XYZ, each median connects a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. Since P is the centroid, it lies along each median.

Now, the given that XJ = 8. So point J is connected to X via a line segment of length 8. Also, there's a line from X to L, implying that L is another point connected to X. Also, there's a line from Z to K. 

Additionally, triangle JKL is formed by points J, K, L. There are lines J-K, K-L, J-P, P-L. So P is connected to J and L. Therefore, triangle JKL has a point P inside it connected to J and L. 

But how does P relate to triangle XYZ? Well, since P is the centroid of XYZ, perhaps there's a relationship between P and the other points. Maybe P is also a point in triangle JKL? 

Wait, the line from J to P and from P to L suggests that P is a point connected to both J and L. In triangle JKL, if P is connected to J and L, maybe P is the centroid of triangle JKL as well? But the problem states that P is the centroid of XYZ. Unless there's some overlap here.

Alternatively, perhaps P is the intersection point of certain lines. Let me think. Since P is the centroid of XYZ, it lies on the medians of XYZ. Suppose that line XJ is a median of XYZ. Wait, but XJ is a line from X to J. Is J the midpoint of YZ? Not necessarily unless specified. However, the problem doesn't state that J is the midpoint. Instead, there's a line from X to J, which is given as length 8.

Wait, perhaps J is a mid-point? But without more info, I can't assume that. Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between the centroids of two triangles. But I'm not sure yet.

Another thought: Since P is the centroid of XYZ, and there's a line from X to J, which is length 8. Also, KP = 3. Since K is connected to J and L, and P is connected to J and L, perhaps triangle JKL has some relation to the centroid P of XYZ.

Alternatively, considering coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to the points could help. Let me try coordinate geometry.

Let me place point X at (0, 0) for simplicity. Let me suppose that triangle XYZ has coordinates such that I can compute the centroid. Let me assign coordinates to make calculations easier.

But before jumping into coordinates, let's recall that in a triangle, the centroid is located at the average of the vertices' coordinates. So if I can express coordinates for X, Y, Z, then find the centroid P, and see how it relates to other points like J and K.

However, without knowing specific coordinates, maybe I need to use vector methods or ratios.

Alternatively, since XJ = 8, and P is the centroid, perhaps there's a relation between XJ and KP. Let me think about the properties of centroids and medians.

Suppose that in triangle XYZ, the centroid P divides each median into a 2:1 ratio. So if there is a median from X to the midpoint of YZ, then P would divide that median into 2:1. But if J is not the midpoint of YZ, then XJ may not be a median. However, the problem mentions that there's a line from X to J, which is part of the given predicates. 

Wait, but there's also a line from X to L. So maybe points J and L are connected to X, and possibly other points. Also, there's a line from Z to K. 

Perhaps there's a parallelogram involved? For instance, if lines XY, YZ, ZX form a triangle, and lines JK, KL, LJ form another triangle. Maybe there's some relationship between them.

Alternatively, since there are lines connecting J to P and P to L, forming triangle JPL. If P is the centroid of XYZ, then maybe PL is part of a median of XYZ?

Wait, but I need to find YJ. The question asks for the length of YJ. Given that XJ is 8, and KP is 3. How do these relate?

Let me think again about the centroid. The centroid divides each median into a 2:1 ratio. So if I can find a median that includes point P, and relate it to XJ or KP.

Alternatively, since there's a line from X to J, perhaps J is a point such that XJ is a median? If J were the midpoint of YZ, then XJ would be a median, and P would lie on that median. But the problem states that P is the centroid, so if XJ is a median, then P would divide XJ into a 2:1 ratio. But the problem gives XJ = 8, and KP = 3. If XJ is a median, then the length from X to P would be 2/3 of XJ, which would be 16/3 ≈ 5.33, but KP is given as 3. Not sure how that connects yet.

Alternatively, maybe KP is part of a median in triangle JKL, and there's a relation between the centroid of XYZ and the centroid of JKL? But the problem only states that P is the centroid of XYZ, not of JKL.

Wait, let's look back at the given lines. There's a line from J to K, K to L, J to P, and P to L. So triangle JKL has points J, K, L, and P is connected to J and L. So P is connected to J and L, which are two vertices of triangle JKL. This suggests that P lies on the line JL of triangle JKL. Because in triangle JKL, the line from J to L is one of its sides. If P is connected to J and L, then P lies somewhere on the line JL. 

But if P is the centroid of triangle XYZ, then maybe there's a relationship between the centroid of XYZ and the line JL in triangle JKL. Perhaps there's a way to connect these two triangles through the position of P?

Alternatively, since P lies on JL (as per the connections J-P and P-L), and P is the centroid of XYZ, maybe there's a way to express the coordinates of P in terms of the other points, leading to equations involving XJ and KP.

Let me try coordinate geometry. Let me assign coordinates to points to model this scenario.

Assume coordinate system where point X is at (0, 0). Let me denote other points accordingly. But since there are multiple points, maybe I need to define variables.

Let me suppose that triangle XYZ has coordinates: X(0, 0), Y(a, b), Z(c, d). Then the centroid P of triangle XYZ would be at ((a + c)/3, (b + d)/3).

Now, there's a line from X to J, with length XJ = 8. Let me denote J as some point (x, y), such that the distance from X(0,0) to J(x,y) is √(x² + y²) = 8. So x² + y² = 64.

Also, there's a line from X to L. Let me denote L as another point, say (p, q). Also, there's a line from Z to K. So K is connected to Z and to L, forming triangle JKL with points J, K, L. Also, there are lines J-K, K-L, J-P, P-L.

Since P is connected to J and L, and lies on line JL. So P lies on the line segment JL. Also, since P is the centroid of XYZ, which has coordinates ((a + c)/3, (b + d)/3).

But how does this relate to the coordinates of J and L?

Alternatively, since P lies on JL, we can parametrize the line JL. Let me assume that J is (x1, y1) and L is (x2, y2). Then any point on line JL can be expressed as (x1 + t(x2 - x1), y1 + t(y2 - y1)) for some parameter t.

Since P is the centroid of XYZ, it must satisfy this parametric equation. But without knowing the coordinates of XYZ, this might not be helpful directly.

Alternatively, consider vectors. Let me think about vectors from X to J and X to L. Since XJ is 8, and maybe there's a relation between vectors XJ and XL?

But I need to connect this with KP = 3. Point K is connected to J and L. So K is part of triangle JKL, and since P is connected to J and L, perhaps K is related to the centroid of JKL? If P were the centroid of JKL, then KP would be a certain fraction of the median. But the problem says P is the centroid of XYZ, not of JKL. However, maybe there's a relationship between the two centroids?

Alternatively, perhaps triangle JKL is constructed in such a way that P is its centroid. If that were true, then KP would be a third of the median. But the problem states that P is the centroid of XYZ, not of JKL. But maybe they're the same point?

Wait, the problem says that P is the centroid of XYZ, and there are lines from J to P and P to L. So P is connected to J and L, which are vertices of triangle JKL. If P is the centroid of XYZ, and also lies on the line JL of triangle JKL, then perhaps there's a relationship between the medians of XYZ and JKL?

Alternatively, since KP = 3, and assuming that P lies on the median from J to L in triangle JKL, then KP would be a portion of that median. If P were the centroid of JKL, then KP would be 1/3 of the median from J to L. But since P is the centroid of XYZ, maybe there's a proportional relationship here.

But how to connect this with XJ = 8?

Let me think again. Suppose that in triangle JKL, P lies on the median from J to L. Then if P were the centroid of JKL, KP would be 1/3 of the median. But since P is the centroid of XYZ, perhaps the median from J to L in triangle JKL is related to the median from X to some point in XYZ?

Alternatively, maybe the line JL in triangle JKL corresponds to a median in triangle XYZ. For example, if JL is the median from X to some point, making P lie on that median. But without more info, this is speculative.

Another approach: Since P is the centroid of XYZ, and there's a line from X to J, which is length 8. If XJ is a median of XYZ, then P would divide it into a 2:1 ratio. So if XJ is a median, then the length from X to P would be (2/3)*XJ = (2/3)*8 = 16/3 ≈ 5.33. But the problem gives KP = 3. How does that tie in?

Alternatively, if KP is part of another median. For instance, if K is the midpoint of some side, then KP could be related to the centroid.

Wait, let's think about triangle XYZ. The centroid P divides each median into 2:1. Suppose that line XJ is a median. Then J would be the midpoint of YZ. But the problem doesn't explicitly state that. However, the existence of line XJ implies that J is connected to X. If J were the midpoint of YZ, then XJ would be a median. 

Assuming that, then since P is the centroid, the length from X to P would be 2/3 of XJ, which is 16/3. But how does KP come into play?

If K is another midpoint or something? Wait, there's a line from Z to K. If K is the midpoint of XJ, then ZK would be a line from Z to the midpoint of XJ. But I don't know if that's the case.

Alternatively, since there's a triangle JKL, and P is connected to J and L, perhaps K is a midpoint of some segment. For example, if K is the midpoint of JL in triangle JKL, then KP would be half of the median. But again, without knowing if K is a midpoint, this is uncertain.

Wait, the problem states that KP = 3. If K is the midpoint of JL in triangle JKL, then since P lies on JL, the distance from K to P would depend on where P is along JL. If P were the midpoint of JL, then KP would be zero. But since KP is 3, P isn't the midpoint. 

But if P is the centroid of XYZ and lies on JL, then maybe there's a proportionality between the segments on JL. For example, if we consider the entire length of JL, and P divides it into parts. But without knowing where P is on JL, this is hard to quantify.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to relate the length KP to the length XJ through the properties of centroids and medians.

Let me try to think of mass point geometry or coordinate geometry.

Let me attempt coordinate geometry again. Assume coordinates for simplicity.

Let me set up coordinate system with X at (0, 0). Let me assume that J is at (8, 0) because XJ = 8. So X is at (0, 0), J is at (8, 0). Now, since P is the centroid of triangle XYZ, and there's a line from X to J, but how does that relate?

Wait, but I don't know the coordinates of Y and Z yet. Let me assume that Y is at (a, b), Z is at (c, d). Then the centroid P of XYZ is at ((a + c)/3, (b + d)/3).

Now, there's a line from X(0,0) to J(8,0), which is the x-axis. Also, there's a line from X(0,0) to L. Let me assume L is at some point (e, f). Also, there's a line from Z(c,d) to K. So K is connected to Z and to L. Also, there's a line from J(8,0) to P, and P to L(e,f).

Since P lies on the line JL. Wait, because there's a line from J to P and from P to L, so P is on the line JL. Therefore, P lies on the line joining J(8,0) and L(e,f). 

So the coordinates of P must satisfy the parametric equation of line JL. Let me write that.

Parametric equations for line JL: starting at J(8,0) and going to L(e,f). So any point on this line can be written as (8 + t(e - 8), 0 + t(f - 0)) = (8 + t(e - 8), tf), where t ranges from 0 to 1 for the segment JL.

Since P is on this line, its coordinates are (8 + t(e - 8), tf) for some t. Also, since P is the centroid of XYZ, its coordinates are ((a + c)/3, (b + d)/3). Therefore:

8 + t(e - 8) = (a + c)/3  
tf = (b + d)/3  

But this introduces too many variables. I need more constraints.

Additionally, there's a line from Z(c,d) to K. So K is a point connected to Z and L. Also, there's a line from J(8,0) to K. So K is connected to J and to Z. Thus, K is the intersection point of lines JK and ZK? Wait, no, since there's a line from J to K and from Z to K, so K is connected to both J and Z. Hence, K is the intersection point of lines J-something and Z-something. Wait, but the line from J to K and the line from Z to K imply that K is a common point. So K is determined by the intersection of lines JK and ZK? No, that's redundant. Actually, K is connected to J and Z, so it's a single point connected to both. So the line from J to K and from Z to K would mean that K is a point such that line JK and line ZK exist. So K is just a point connected to J and Z. 

But how does this help? Maybe there's more information about triangle JKL? It's defined by points J, K, L. We have lines J-K, K-L, J-P, P-L. So P is connected to J and L. So in triangle JKL, P is a point connected to J and L, which means it lies on the line JL. Which we already considered.

Now, since KP = 3, and K is connected to J and L, and P is on JL, then KP is the distance from K to P along line JL? Or is it the straight-line distance from K to P? Wait, the problem says KP = 3. Assuming that K is a point not on line JL, then KP is the straight-line distance. But if K is on line JL, then KP would be a segment along the line. But earlier, we said that P is on line JL, and K is connected to J and L. So depending on where K is, KP could vary.

Wait, but if K is connected to J and to Z, then K is a point such that line JK and line ZK exist. So K is the intersection of lines J-something and Z-something. Wait, but without knowing more about the location of K, this is unclear.

Maybe there's a way to express the coordinates of K in terms of other points. For example, since K is connected to Z and to J, perhaps K is the midpoint of ZJ? Or some other relation. But the problem doesn't specify that.

Alternatively, since P is on line JL, and KP = 3, and XJ = 8, maybe there's a way to relate these using vectors or ratios.

Let me think about the fact that P is the centroid of XYZ, and lies on line JL. So the coordinates of P are ((a + c)/3, (b + d)/3), and it's also on line JL. 

Let me consider that line JL goes from J(8,0) to L(e,f). So the parametric equation for JL is (8 + t(e - 8), 0 + t(f - 0)) = (8 + t(e - 8), tf), as before.

Therefore, the coordinates of P are (8 + t(e - 8), tf) = ((a + c)/3, (b + d)/3).

But I still have too many variables. Let me try to find relations between these variables.

Also, there's a line from Z to K. Let me assume that K is a point on line ZL? Or somewhere else? Without more info, it's difficult.

Wait, the problem also mentions that there's a line from Z to K, and a line from K to L. So triangle JKL has points J, K, L, with K connected to Z. So maybe K is the midpoint of ZL? Or some other point?

Alternatively, since there's a line from Z to K and from K to L, forming triangle JKL, perhaps K is the midpoint of ZL? If that were true, then ZK would be a median of triangle ZL... something? Not sure.

Alternatively, since there's a line from Z to K and from K to L, maybe K is the midpoint of ZL? If yes, then ZK would be half of ZL, but again, without knowing L's coordinates, this is speculative.

This seems too vague. Maybe I should focus on the given data: XJ = 8, KP = 3, and P is the centroid of XYZ. Need to find YJ.

Let me think about the centroid. In triangle XYZ, the centroid P divides each median into 2:1. So if I can express YJ in terms of other segments.

Wait, if I consider that XJ is a median, then YJ would be related to other sides. But I don't know if XJ is a median. However, if XJ is a median, then J is the midpoint of YZ, and thus YJ would be equal to ZJ. But since XJ is a median, then the length from X to J is 8. But then the centroid divides this median into 2:1, so XP = 2/3 * XJ = 16/3, and PJ = 1/3 * XJ = 8/3. But how does this relate to KP = 3?

If KP is related to this, perhaps there's a way to connect KP with other segments. But I'm stuck.

Wait, maybe there's a relationship between the centroid of XYZ and the point P lying on JL. Suppose that in triangle JKL, P is the centroid, but the problem says P is the centroid of XYZ. So if P is the centroid of both XYZ and JKL, then KP would be a median of JKL, giving KP = 1/3 of the median. But since P is the centroid of XYZ, maybe there's a way to link the medians.

But the problem doesn't say P is the centroid of JKL, only of XYZ. So this might not hold. However, if I assume that P is the centroid of both, then KP = 1/3 of the median from J to L in triangle JKL. But since XJ = 8, and if JL is related to XJ...

Alternatively, if JL is the same as XJ, but that would mean L is the same as J, which is not possible.

Hmm. Maybe I need to consider that the line from X to J is a median of XYZ, making J the midpoint of YZ. Then, since P is the centroid, it divides XJ into 2:1. So XP = 2/3 * XJ = 16/3, and PJ = 1/3 * XJ = 8/3. But how does KP = 3 fit in?

If KP is part of another median, say from K to the midpoint of some segment. But I don't know where K is.

Wait, there's a line from Z to K. If K is the midpoint of YZ, then ZK would be a median of triangle XYZ. But since J is already the midpoint of YZ (if XJ is a median), then K would coincide with J? But that would make KP = 0, which contradicts KP = 3. So that can't be.

Alternatively, if K is a different midpoint. For example, if K is the midpoint of XJ. Since XJ = 8, then XK = KJ = 4. But then, there's a line from Z to K. If K is the midpoint of XJ, then ZK would be a line from Z to the midpoint of XJ. But how does this relate to KP = 3?

In this case, P is the centroid of XYZ. If K is the midpoint of XJ, then ZK is a median of XYZ? No, because the medians go from vertices to midpoints of opposite sides. If XJ is a median (with J as midpoint of YZ), then K being the midpoint of XJ would be a different point.

But even then, I'm not seeing the connection to KP = 3.

Alternatively, since P is the centroid of XYZ, and there's a line from X to J (which is a median if J is the midpoint of YZ), then the length from X to P is 2/3 of XJ = 16/3. If KP is 3, and if K is somewhere on the line from Z to some point, perhaps relating to the centroid?

I feel like I'm missing a key insight here. Let me try to recall properties of centroids and medians.

The centroid divides each median into 2:1. If I can find a median that involves KP = 3, then maybe I can relate it to XJ = 8.

Wait, if KP is a segment related to a median in another triangle. For example, if there's a median in triangle JKL, and P is on that median, then KP = 3 would be a portion of it. But since P is the centroid of XYZ, maybe there's a way to express this in terms of the medians of XYZ.

Alternatively, think about vectors. Let me denote vectors with bold letters. Let O be the origin. Let me assume X is at vector x, Y at y, Z at z. The centroid P of XYZ is (x + y + z)/3.

Now, there's a point J such that |XJ| = 8. So |j - x| = 8, where j is the position vector of J.

Also, there's a point P connected to J and L. So P lies on line JL. So P can be expressed as a weighted average between J and L. Let me say P = λJ + (1 - λ)L for some λ.

But P is also the centroid of XYZ: P = (x + y + z)/3.

So combining these:

λJ + (1 - λ)L = (x + y + z)/3.

But without knowing more about J and L, this is still abstract.

Additionally, KP = 3. K is connected to J and Z. So K is a point such that there's a line from Z to K and from K to L. So K is a point connected to Z and L, hence lying on the line ZL? Or is it the intersection of lines ZK and JL? Not sure.

This seems too vague. Maybe I need to consider specific cases or make assumptions to simplify.

Let me assume that J is the midpoint of YZ, making XJ a median. So J is midpoint of YZ. Then, since P is the centroid, it divides XJ into 2:3 and 1:3. So XP = 2/3 * XJ = 16/3, PJ = 8/3.

Now, there's a point K connected to Z and to L. If I assume that K is the midpoint of XJ, then ZK would be a line from Z to midpoint of XJ. But then, how does KP relate?

If K is the midpoint of XJ, then K is at (X + J)/2. Since X is at (0,0) and J is at (8,0), then K would be at (4, 0). Then, ZK would be a line from Z to (4, 0). But I don't know where Z is.

But if P is at (XP, 0) = (16/3, 0), since X is at (0,0) and J is at (8,0), then the centroid P is at (16/3, 0). Wait, but that would mean P is on the x-axis. Now, if K is at (4, 0), then KP is the distance between (4, 0) and (16/3, 0), which is |16/3 - 4| = |16/3 - 12/3| = 4/3 ≈ 1.33, which is not 3. So this doesn't match the given KP = 3. So this assumption is invalid.

Hmm. Maybe K is not the midpoint of XJ. Let me think differently.

Since KP = 3, and P is the centroid of XYZ, perhaps there's a relation between KP and other segments through the properties of centroids.

Wait, if I consider triangle XYZ and the centroid P, and there's a line from X to J, and another line from P to K, with KP = 3, maybe using mass point geometry or area ratios?

Alternatively, think about vectors. Let me assume that vector JP = something related to other vectors.

But I'm not making progress. Let me try to search for standard problems or properties.

Wait, the problem gives XJ = 8 and KP = 3, asks for YJ. Maybe there's a relation where YJ is twice KP? Or something similar.

If I assume that YJ = 2*KP = 6, then the answer would be B. But why?

Let me think: If P is the centroid of XYZ, and if there's a median from X to J (assuming J is the midpoint of YZ), then XP = 2/3 XJ = 16/3. But KP is 3, which might be related to the length of another median.

Alternatively, if KP is part of a median in another triangle, and using the property that the centroid divides it into 2:1, then KP = 1/3 of the median, so the full median would be 9, making YJ = 9? But that would give answer D.

But why would KP be 1/3 of a median?

Alternatively, if KP is 1/3 of the median from K to some point, and if that median is related to YJ.

But this is too vague. Let me try to think of specific examples.

Suppose that in triangle XYZ, P is the centroid. Let me choose coordinates for simplicity.

Let me set X at (0, 0), Y at (0, 6), Z at (6, 0). Then the centroid P is at ((0+0+6)/3, (0+6+0)/3) = (2, 2).

Now, let me choose J such that XJ = 8. Let me pick J at (8, 0). Then the distance from X(0,0) to J(8,0) is 8, which fits.

Now, P is at (2,2). Now, we need to find KP = 3. Where is K?

There's a line from Z(6,0) to K, and from K to L. Also, there's a line from J(8,0) to P(2,2) and from P(2,2) to L.

Let me assume that L is some point such that P lies on line JL. Since J is (8,0) and P is (2,2), the line JL passes through (8,0) and (2,2). Let me find parametric equations for this line.

Parametric equations: Starting at J(8,0), direction vector (-6, 2). So any point on JL is (8 - 6t, 0 + 2t).

Since P(2,2) is on this line, let's verify: When t=1, we get (8-6*1, 0+2*1)=(2,2). Yes, so t=1 gives P. So L is another point on this line. Let's say L is at t=2: (8 - 6*2, 0 + 2*2) = (8-12, 4) = (-4, 4). So L is at (-4,4).

Now, there's a line from Z(6,0) to K, and from K to L(-4,4). Let me find K such that there's a line from Z(6,0) to K and from K to L(-4,4). This means K is a point on the line connecting Z(6,0) and L(-4,4)? Or is it a different line?

Wait, the line from Z to K and from K to L implies that K is a point such that it is connected to both Z and L. So K can be anywhere, but in this case, since there's a line from Z to K and from K to L, it suggests that K is a point such that ZK and KL are edges of triangle JKL. So K is the intersection point of lines ZK and KL? No, that's not helpful.

Actually, in this setup, K is a point connected to Z and to L. So K is somewhere such that ZK and KL are lines. To find K, we need more information. But in our current setup, we don't have enough.

However, we know that KP = 3. Since P is at (2,2), and K is a point such that the distance from K to P is 3. Let me assume that K is on line ZL, since there's a line from Z to K and from K to L. Wait, if K is on line ZL, then we can parameterize it.

Line ZL connects Z(6,0) to L(-4,4). Let me find the parametric equation for this line. Direction vector is (-10, 4). Parametric equations: (6 - 10s, 0 + 4s), s ∈ [0,1].

So any point K on this line can be expressed as (6 - 10s, 4s).

Now, the distance from K to P(2,2) is 3. So:

√[(6 - 10s - 2)^2 + (4s - 2)^2] = 3

Square both sides:

(4 - 10s)^2 + (4s - 2)^2 = 9

Expand:

(16 - 80s + 100s²) + (16s² - 16s + 4) = 9

Combine like terms:

16 - 80s + 100s² + 16s² -16s +4 = 9

Total: 100s² + 16s² = 116s²; -80s -16s = -96s; 16 +4 = 20.

So: 116s² -96s +20 = 9 → 116s² -96s +11 = 0

Solve quadratic equation: 116s² -96s +11 = 0

Discriminant D = 96² - 4*116*11 = 9216 - 5264 = 3952

Wait, sqrt(3952) is approximately 62.87.

s = [96 ± 62.87]/232

Calculate s₁ = (96 + 62.87)/232 ≈ 158.87/232 ≈ 0.684

s₂ = (96 - 62.87)/232 ≈ 33.13/232 ≈ 0.1428

So two possible positions for K on line ZL. Let's take s = 0.1428 for simplicity.

Then K is at (6 - 10s, 4s) ≈ (6 - 10*0.1428, 4*0.1428) ≈ (6 - 1.428, 0.571) ≈ (4.572, 0.571)

Now, we need to find YJ. In this coordinate system, Y is at (0,6), J is at (8,0). So the distance YJ is sqrt((8-0)^2 + (0-6)^2) = sqrt(64 + 36) = sqrt(100) = 10. But this contradicts the answer choices, which are 3, 6, 8, 9. So this suggests my assumption is wrong.

Wait, but in this example, YJ is 10, but the answer options don't include 10. So either my assumptions are incorrect, or there's a mistake in the approach.

But in this case, the given KP was 3, which matched the condition. However, YJ came out as 10, which isn't among the choices. This indicates that my arbitrary choice of coordinates might not align with the problem's conditions. Perhaps I made wrong assumptions in setting up the coordinates.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different configuration where YJ equals one of the options. Let me try adjusting.

Let me instead assume that YJ is 6, which is option B. Let me see if that works.

But how? Let me think. If YJ is 6, and XJ is 8, then maybe using the properties of medians and centroids.

Wait, in triangle XYZ, if J is the midpoint of YZ, then YJ = ZJ. But XJ is a median, so XJ = 8. Then, the centroid P divides this median into 2:1, so XP = 16/3, and PJ = 8/3. But KP = 3, so if KP is related to PJ, then 8/3 ≈ 2.666, which is close to 3, but not exactly. Maybe there's a scaling factor?

If I assume that KP = 3 is related to PJ, then maybe there's a proportion. Like, if KP = 3 and PJ = 8/3, then the ratio is 3 : 8/3 = 9:8. But I don't know how this helps.

Alternatively, if there's a similar triangle or something. 

Wait, another idea: Since P is the centroid of XYZ, and there's a line from P to K with length 3, and XJ = 8, maybe applying the formula for the distance from centroid to a point.

But I don't recall a direct formula. Alternatively, using vectors.

Let me assume that vector PK = 3, and vector XJ = 8. If I can relate these vectors through the centroid.

But without knowing the exact positions, it's challenging.

Alternatively, using mass point geometry: If P is the centroid, it has masses 1 at each vertex. But I'm not sure how this applies here.

Another approach: Since P is the centroid, and there's a line from X to J (length 8), and KP = 3, perhaps using the concept of medians and ratios.

If I consider that in triangle XYZ, the centroid P, and there's a point J such that XJ is a median, then the length from X to P is 2/3 of XJ = 16/3. If KP is 3, and if K is a point such that PK is part of another median, then perhaps using similar triangles.

But I'm still stuck. Let me think about the answer choices. The options are 3, 6, 8, 9. Since XJ is 8, and KP is 3, and YJ is asked, perhaps YJ is 6, as 8 - 2 = 6, or 8 + 3 = 11 (not in choices), or 8 * 3/4 = 6. Maybe there's a 2:1 ratio involved.

If YJ is 6, then in a scenario where XJ is 8, and P is the centroid, maybe the ratio between YJ and KP is 2:1. For example, if YJ is twice KP, then 2*3=6. This might be plausible.

But why would YJ be twice KP? Let me think: If YJ is a median, and KP is a segment related to another median. For example, if YJ is a median, and KP is part of another median, and due to centroid properties, the ratio is 2:1.

Alternatively, if there's a triangle where YJ is a median, and KP is a segment that is 1/2 of another median, leading to YJ = 2*KP = 6.

This seems plausible. Given that the answer choices include 6, and the logic fits, I'll go with option B.
