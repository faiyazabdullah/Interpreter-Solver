Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have points A, B, and C, and some length equations involving x. The goal is to find AB, which is given as 2x + 5. Let me parse the given info again.

First, the predicates say that the length of AB equals 2x + 5, BC equals 3x - 4, AC equals 27, and also AB equals BC. Wait, so AB and BC are equal? That means 2x + 5 = 3x - 4. Solving that equation should give me the value of x. Once I have x, I can plug it back into the expression for AB to find its length.

Let me check if there's anything else. Also, AC is given as 27. But since AB and BC are equal, maybe triangle ABC is isoceles? But wait, does that matter here? The problem doesn't mention angles, just lengths. So perhaps the main thing is that AB equals BC, leading to the equation 2x +5 = 3x -4. Let me solve that.

Subtract 2x from both sides: 5 = x -4. Then add 4 to both sides: x = 9. So substituting x=9 into AB's expression: 2*9 +5 = 18 +5 = 23. Therefore, AB would be 23. Looking at the options, A is 23. 

Wait, but let me make sure there isn't something missing. The problem mentions Line(A,C) has length 27. Since AB and BC are equal, and AC is the third side. Maybe we need to verify if the triangle inequality holds? For example, AB + BC > AC. Since AB = BC = 2x+5, then AB + BC = 2*(2x+5). Let me compute with x=9: 2*(2*9 +5)=2*(23)=46, which is greater than 27. Also, AB + AC > BC? Well, AB is 23, AC is 27, so 23 +27=50>23. Similarly for other inequalities. So that checks out. 

But another thought: could there be another way where AC is involved? Like maybe using Pythagoras if it's a right triangle? But the problem doesn't state that ABC is a right triangle. The only given equality is AB=BC, so it's an isoceles triangle with AB=BC. So AC is the base. However, unless there's more info, maybe we don't need to consider that. Because the problem gives us directly that AB equals BC, so the equation comes from that. 

Therefore, solving 2x+5=3x-4 leads to x=9, making AB=23. Which is option A. So the answer should be A.
