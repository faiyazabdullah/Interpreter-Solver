MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given information and figure out how the different predicates relate to each other. 

So, the problem mentions a rhombus Q, R, S, T. Wait, a rhombus is a type of quadrilateral where all sides are equal, and opposite angles are congruent. Also, the sum of the interior angles in any quadrilateral is 360 degrees. That's one of the given predicates. 

Now, looking at the angle measures: 
- Measure of angle Q is 2x + 5.
- Measure of angle R is x.
- Measure of angle S is 2x + 7.
- Measure of angle T is x.

Additionally, there are two equality predicates: Angle Q equals Angle S, and Angle R equals Angle T. Since it's a rhombus, opposite angles should already be equal. So that checks out because Q and S are opposite angles, and R and T are opposite angles. Therefore, these equalities are consistent with the properties of a rhombus.

Since it's a quadrilateral, the sum of all four angles must be 360 degrees. Let me write that down:

Angle Q + Angle R + Angle S + Angle T = 360°

Substituting the expressions given:

(2x + 5) + x + (2x + 7) + x = 360

Let me simplify this equation. Combine like terms:

First, expand the terms: 2x + 5 + x + 2x + 7 + x. Adding up the x terms: 2x + x + 2x + x = 6x. Then the constants: 5 + 7 = 12. So total equation becomes:

6x + 12 = 360

Subtract 12 from both sides:

6x = 360 - 12 → 6x = 348

Divide both sides by 6:

x = 348 / 6 → x = 58

Wait, but hold on. Let me check if I did that correctly. 6 times 58 is 348? Let me verify. 6*50=300, 6*8=48, so yes, 300+48=348. Correct.

But wait, the question asks for m∠R, which is x. So according to this calculation, x is 58. But looking at the answer choices, A is 58. However, sometimes there could be mistakes in setting up the equations. Let me double-check.

Given that in a rhombus, opposite angles are congruent. So Angle Q equals Angle S, which are given as 2x + 5 and 2x + 7. Wait, hold on! The problem states that Equals(Angle(Q), Angle(S)). But according to the initial expressions, Angle Q is 2x + 5 and Angle S is 2x + 7. If they are supposed to be equal, then 2x + 5 = 2x + 7. Wait, that would imply 5 = 7, which is impossible. There's a contradiction here. Did I misread something?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the given predicates. The user wrote:

- Equals(Angle(Q), Angle(S))
- Equals(Angle(R), Angle(T))

So according to the problem statement, Angle Q equals Angle S, and Angle R equals Angle T. However, according to the measure expressions given:

MeasureOf(Angle(Q)) = 2x +5

MeasureOf(Angle(S)) = 2x +7

Therefore, if Angle Q equals Angle S, then 2x +5 = 2x +7 ⇒ 5 = 7, which is impossible. This suggests that perhaps there's a typo in my understanding, or maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, but the problem says "Rhombus(Q,R,S,T)". In a rhombus, opposite angles are congruent. Therefore, Angle Q should equal Angle S, and Angle R should equal Angle T. But according to the given expressions, Angle Q is 2x+5 and Angle S is 2x+7. So unless those expressions are incorrect, or there's another relationship.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a mistake? Or perhaps I misread the expressions. Let me check again.

Original problem:

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(Q)), 2x + 5)

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(R)), x)

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(S)), 2x + 7)

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(T)), x)

Then, Equals(Angle(Q), Angle(S)) and Equals(Angle(R), Angle(T)).

This seems contradictory. Because if Angle Q equals Angle S, then their measures should be equal. But according to the expressions, they are 2x+5 and 2x+7. Which implies that 2x+5 = 2x+7 ⇒ 5=7, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be an error in either the setup or my interpretation.

Wait, maybe the problem isn't stating that Angle(Q) equals Angle(S) directly, but that the measure of Angle(Q) equals the measure of Angle(S). Wait, the predicate is written as Equals(Angle(Q), Angle(S)), which means their measures are equal. So the measures must be equal. Hence, the expressions must be equal. But they aren't unless there's some other variable involved.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in how the variables are assigned. Maybe the problem uses different variables for the angles? For example, maybe the angles are labeled differently. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem defines a rhombus Q, R, S, T. So the vertices are Q, R, S, T. In a rhombus, consecutive angles are supplementary. Wait, no—opposite angles are congruent, adjacent angles are supplementary. So if Angle Q and Angle S are opposite, they must be equal. Similarly, Angle R and Angle T are opposite and equal.

But according to the given measures, Angle Q is 2x+5, Angle S is 2x+7. So they should be equal. So unless there's a miscalculation here, this is conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, but assuming that the problem is correct, perhaps there's a different way to interpret it.

Wait, maybe the problem is not about a rhombus but about a general quadrilateral? Wait, no—the first predicate is Rhombus(Q,R,S,T), so it's definitely a rhombus. Therefore, the opposite angles must be congruent. Thus, the measures of Angle Q and Angle S must be equal. But according to the given expressions, they differ by 2. So this seems contradictory. Unless there's an error in the problem setup, but since we have to work with it, perhaps there's a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe the expressions are not for the angles themselves, but for their measures. Wait, but the problem says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(Q)), 2x + 5), so that's the measure. Therefore, the measure of Angle Q is 2x +5, measure of Angle S is 2x+7. Therefore, they should be equal, leading to 2x+5=2x+7 ⇒ 5=7, which is impossible. So this suggests that there's a mistake in the problem or perhaps a misinterpretation.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are not labeled in order? Like, maybe the quadrilateral is not labeled sequentially? For example, in a rhombus, the order of the vertices matters. Suppose the quadrilateral is Q-R-S-T connected in order, making a rhombus. Then the opposite angles would be Q and S, R and T. But if the labels are different, like maybe the order is Q-R-T-S or something else, then the opposite angles might be different. But the standard labeling of a quadrilateral assumes that the vertices are in order, so Q connected to R, R to S, S to T, T to Q. So opposite angles would be Q and S, R and T.

Assuming that, then the measures of Q and S must be equal, but according to the problem's given expressions, they are not. Therefore, this seems inconsistent. However, since this is a problem presented to solve, perhaps there's a different way to interpret the angle measures. Maybe the expressions are not for the actual angles but for something else? No, the problem says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(Q)), 2x +5), so that's explicit.

Wait, maybe the problem intended that Angle(Q) and Angle(S) are equal, so their measures are equal. Therefore, even though the expressions look different, maybe there's a substitution. Wait, but the expressions are given as 2x+5 and 2x+7. So unless there's another relation between them, such as involving the same variable. But that leads to inconsistency. 

Wait, unless there's a miscalculation in the problem. Let me try to proceed despite this contradiction, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore that and just use the sum of angles. Let me see.

Earlier, I set up the equation:

(2x +5) + x + (2x +7) + x = 360 ⇒ 6x + 12 = 360 ⇒ x=58. 

But then, if x=58, then measure of Angle Q is 2*58 +5 = 121°, and measure of Angle S is 2*58 +7 = 123°, which are not equal. But the problem says they should be equal. So this creates a contradiction. Therefore, this suggests that my initial approach is wrong. 

Hmm. What's the issue here? Maybe the problem didn't state that the shape is a rhombus, but rather that it's a quadrilateral with certain properties. Wait, the first predicate is Rhombus(Q,R,S,T), so it is a rhombus. Therefore, the opposite angles must be equal. Hence, the measures of Angle Q and Angle S must be equal. Therefore, there must be an error in the given expressions, or perhaps I misread the expressions.

Wait, let me check again the original problem's angle measures:

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(Q)), 2x + 5)

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(R)), x)

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(S)), 2x + 7)

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(T)), x)

Ah! Wait, maybe there's a typo, and the measure of Angle(S) is meant to be 2x +5 instead of 2x +7? Or perhaps Angle(Q) is 2x +7 and Angle(S) is 2x +5? That would make them equal. But without knowing, I have to work with what's given.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not a rhombus, but a general quadrilateral, and the first predicate is misleading? But the problem says "Rhombus(Q,R,S,T)", so it's a rhombus. Therefore, there's a contradiction in the given data. 

But since this is a problem to solve, perhaps I should assume that despite the contradiction, the sum of the angles gives us x=58, and the answer is A. However, this would mean that the problem has conflicting information, which is unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the angle measures were intended to be different. Let me consider that maybe the measure of Angle(S) is x instead of 2x+7. Let me test that possibility.

Suppose there was a typo, and Angle(S) is x. Then the measures would be:

Q: 2x+5, R:x, S:x, T:x. Sum: 2x+5 +x +x +x = 5x +5 = 360 ⇒ 5x = 355 ⇒ x=71. Not matching answer choices. 

Alternatively, if Angle(S) is also x, but then Q is 2x+5, which would require 2x+5 = x ⇒ x=-5, which is invalid. 

Alternatively, maybe Angle(S) is 2x +5, same as Q. Then the measures would be:

Q: 2x+5, R:x, S:2x+5, T:x. Sum: (2x+5)+(x)+(2x+5)+x = 6x +10 = 360 ⇒ 6x=350 ⇒ x≈58.333... Not an integer, and none of the answer choices match. 

Alternatively, if Angle(S) is 2x +5, and Angle(Q) is also 2x+5, then same as above. 

Alternatively, maybe the measure of Angle(S) is 2x +5, and Angle(Q) is also 2x +5, so that they are equal. Then the other angles are R=x and T=x. So sum would be 2*(2x+5) + x +x = 4x +10 + 2x = 6x +10 = 360 ⇒ 6x=350 ⇒ x=350/6 ≈58.333. Still not matching answer choices. 

But the answer options include 58, which is close to this. However, this suggests that there might be a mistake in the problem's expression for Angle(S). 

Alternatively, perhaps the measure of Angle(S) is x, and Angle(Q) is 2x+5. Then since Q=S, 2x+5 = x ⇒ x=-5, which is invalid. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in my earlier step. Let me go back. 

Original setup: 

Sum of angles = 360. 

Angles: Q: 2x+5, R:x, S:2x+7, T:x. 

Sum: 2x+5 +x +2x+7 +x = (2x+x+2x+x) + (5+7) = 6x +12 = 360 ⇒ 6x=348 ⇒ x=58. 

Even though this causes Q≠S, but maybe the problem has an error, and we're supposed to ignore that? Or perhaps the problem meant that the measures of Q and S are equal, so that 2x+5 = 2x+7, which is impossible, implying that there's no solution. But since the answer choices exist, likely there's a different approach. 

Wait, maybe the problem refers to a different kind of quadrilateral, not a rhombus? If it's not a rhombus, then opposite angles don't have to be equal. So perhaps the first predicate is incorrect. Let me consider that possibility. 

If the shape is just a general quadrilateral, then the sum of angles is still 360°, and we can use the given expressions. Even though the first predicate says it's a rhombus, maybe that's a mistake. Assuming that, then proceeding with the equation gives x=58, which is option A. But why does the problem mention it's a rhombus? If it's a rhombus, then the opposite angles must be equal, which conflicts with the given expressions. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and there's a different relationship. Perhaps the angles are not the ones I think. For example, maybe in a rhombus, adjacent angles are supplementary. So if Angle Q and Angle R are adjacent, then Q + R = 180°. Similarly, R + S = 180°, etc. Let me explore this possibility. 

In a rhombus, consecutive angles are supplementary. So, for example, Angle Q + Angle R = 180°, Angle R + Angle S = 180°, etc. Let me check this. 

If that's the case, then we can set up equations. Let's say:

Angle Q + Angle R = 180°

Angle R + Angle S = 180°

But from the given expressions:

Angle Q = 2x +5

Angle R = x

Angle S = 2x +7

So substituting into the first equation:

(2x +5) + x = 180 ⇒ 3x +5 = 180 ⇒ 3x = 175 ⇒ x = 175/3 ≈58.333...

Second equation: Angle R + Angle S = x + (2x +7) = 3x +7 = 180 ⇒ 3x = 173 ⇒ x=173/3 ≈57.666...

These give different values for x, which is inconsistent. Hence, this suggests that the given angle measures do not satisfy the supplementary condition of a rhombus, which is a contradiction. 

Thus, there's a fundamental inconsistency in the problem's data. However, since the answer choices include 58, which is very close to the x value obtained from the sum of angles (58), maybe the problem expects us to overlook the contradiction and choose x=58. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem had a different intention. Let me think again. 

Maybe the problem meant that the shape is a parallelogram, not necessarily a rhombus? In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, and consecutive angles are supplementary. If that's the case, then we can proceed. 

Assuming it's a parallelogram, then Angle Q = Angle S, and Angle R = Angle T. Let's use that. 

From the expressions:

Angle Q = 2x +5, Angle S = 2x +7. Setting them equal: 2x +5 = 2x +7 ⇒ 5=7, which is still impossible. 

Wait, this is the same contradiction as before. Therefore, regardless of whether it's a parallelogram or rhombus, the given expressions lead to a contradiction. 

But since the problem includes the answer choices, and the only possible way to get an answer is by ignoring the contradiction and using the sum of angles, giving x=58. Hence, the answer would be A. 

Perhaps the problem intended for Angle(S) to be 2x +5 instead of 2x +7. If that were the case, then Angle Q and S would both be 2x+5, and the sum would be:

(2x+5) + x + (2x+5) +x = 6x +10 = 360 ⇒ 6x=350 ⇒ x=350/6 ≈58.333... which is approximately 58.33, but still not matching any answer choice. 

Alternatively, if Angle(S) is x, then:

Angle Q = 2x+5, Angle R =x, Angle S =x, Angle T=x. Sum: 2x+5 +x +x +x =5x +5 =360 ⇒ 5x=355 ⇒x=71, which is not among the choices. 

Alternatively, if Angle(S) is 2x +5 and Angle(Q) is x. Then, since Q and S are equal: x = 2x +5 ⇒ x = -5, invalid. 

It seems that the only feasible way to proceed is to assume that the given expressions are correct, and the problem has a typo, and proceed with the sum of angles, getting x=58. Despite the contradiction in the rhombus property, this is the only way to arrive at an answer. 

Hence, the measure of ∠R is x=58°, corresponding to option A.
