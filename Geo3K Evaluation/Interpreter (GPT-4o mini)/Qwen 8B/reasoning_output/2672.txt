<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points C, A, D, and B. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

First, the lengths: CA is 28 units, AD is 8 units, CB is 30 units, and BD is y, which we need to find. Then there's some angle info: Angle at A, specifically Angle CAD is a right angle. Also, Point A lies on line CD, and lines CA and AD are perpendicular. Wait, since they mention Perpendicular(Line(C,A), Line(A,D)), so those two lines are perpendicular. That makes sense because the angle at A is a right angle.

So, visualizing this, maybe I should draw a diagram. Let me imagine point A. Since CA and AD are perpendicular, they form a right angle at A. So, if I consider line CD passing through A, with CA being one segment and AD another. So, points C, A, D are colinear? Wait, no. Wait, the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(C,D)). Oh, right! So point A is on the line CD. Therefore, line CD passes through point A. But also, CA and AD are perpendicular. Hmm. Wait, if A is on line CD, then CA and AD would be parts of line CD. But how can they be perpendicular unless... Wait, that seems contradictory. Because if A is on line CD, then CA and AD are segments along the same line, making them collinear. But they're supposed to be perpendicular. That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I misread something.

Wait, the Perpendicular(Line(C,A), Line(A,D)) predicate. So line CA is perpendicular to line AD. But if A is on line CD, then line CA and AD are parts of line CD. Wait, but if two lines are perpendicular, they can't be colinear. So there's a contradiction here unless my understanding is wrong.

Hold on, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check again. The PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(C,D)) means that point A is somewhere on the line connecting C and D. Then, line CA and line AD are perpendicular. So line CA is from C to A, and line AD is from A to D. But since A is on line CD, then line CA and line AD are segments of line CD. However, they can't be perpendicular unless they form a right angle. Wait, but if they are parts of the same line, they are colinear. How can they be perpendicular?

This suggests that there's an error in my interpretation. Maybe the line CD isn't straight? No, lines are straight by definition. Alternatively, maybe the lines CA and AD are not parts of line CD. Wait, but if A is on line CD, then line CD contains points C, A, D. Therefore, line CA is part of line CD, and line AD is also part of line CD. Thus, they are colinear, hence cannot be perpendicular. This seems like a contradiction. 

But the problem states that Perpendicular(Line(C,A), Line(A,D)). There must be something wrong here. Wait, could it be that line CA is not the same as line CD? Wait, no. Because line CD is defined by points C and D, and point A is on that line. So line CA is part of line CD, and line AD is also part of line CD. Hence, they are colinear. Therefore, they can't be perpendicular. Unless the problem has a typo, or I'm misunderstanding something.

Alternatively, maybe the lines CA and AD are not the same line. Wait, but if A is on line CD, then line CA connects C to A, and line AD connects A to D. Both are parts of line CD. So they are colinear. Hence, they can't be perpendicular. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. But the problem gives us these premises, so perhaps I need to re-examine the setup.

Wait, maybe the lines CA and AD are not colinear? But if point A is on line CD, then line CD must pass through A. So line CA is from C to A, line AD is from A to D. These are two segments of the same line. Therefore, they are colinear. So they can't be perpendicular. Therefore, this seems impossible. But since the problem gives us these conditions, perhaps there's a different configuration. Maybe the line CD is not straight? Or maybe the lines CA and AD are not parts of CD? Wait, but the point A is on line CD. So line CD must contain A. 

Hmm. This seems confusing. Let me think again. Perhaps the lines CA and AD are not colinear. Wait, but if A is on line CD, then line CD includes points C, A, D. So line CA is from C to A, line AD is from A to D. So they are parts of line CD. Therefore, they are colinear. Hence, they can't be perpendicular. 

Wait, maybe the lines CA and AD are not the same line. Wait, but line CA and line AD share point A. If they are perpendicular, then they form a right angle at A. But if A is on line CD, then lines CA and AD are parts of line CD. Therefore, they can't be perpendicular. Therefore, there must be a miscalculation here. 

Alternatively, perhaps the line CD is not a straight line? No, lines are straight. So this seems impossible. Therefore, maybe the problem is not about line CD but about other lines? Wait, the predicate says Perpendicular(Line(C,A), Line(A,D)). So line CA and line AD are perpendicular. But if A is on line CD, then line CA and line AD are colinear. Which contradicts the perpendicularity. 

Wait, unless line CD is not straight. But lines are always straight. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. But the problem is given, so there must be a way to resolve this. Let me try to visualize differently. Maybe point A is not between C and D? Suppose line CD extends beyond A, such that A is outside the segment CD. For example, suppose C---A---D, but that would make line CA and AD colinear. Still, they are on the same line. 

Alternatively, maybe the lines CA and AD are not colinear. But if A is on line CD, then line CA is part of line CD. So line CA and line AD are parts of line CD. Therefore, they are colinear. Therefore, they can't be perpendicular. 

Therefore, there must be an error in my understanding. Let me check the original problem again. 

Wait, the problem says: PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(C,D)). So point A is on line CD. And Perpendicular(Line(C,A), Line(A,D)). So line CA and line AD are perpendicular. Therefore, the only possibility is that line CA and line AD are not colinear. But how? If point A is on line CD, then line CD contains A. So line CA is from C to A, which is part of line CD. Line AD is from A to D, which is also part of line CD. Therefore, lines CA and AD are colinear. Therefore, they can't be perpendicular. 

Unless the line CD is not a straight line? But that's impossible. Therefore, the only conclusion is that there's a mistake in the problem, or I'm missing something. 

Wait, perhaps the line CD is not straight? But that's not possible. Lines are straight by definition. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses vectors or coordinate geometry? Let me try assigning coordinates. Let's place point A at the origin (0,0). Since Angle CAD is a right angle, and lines CA and AD are perpendicular. So if we take line CA as horizontal and line AD as vertical. 

Let me assume coordinates. Let’s set up coordinate system where point A is at (0,0). Since CA and AD are perpendicular, let me define line CA as the x-axis and line AD as the y-axis. So point C is somewhere along the x-axis, say at (-a, 0), and point D is along the y-axis, say at (0, b). Wait, but the problem says that point A lies on line CD. So line CD connects points C and D. If point A is on line CD, then in this coordinate system, line CD goes from C(-a,0) to D(0,b). Let me find the equation of line CD. 

Parametric equations for line CD: starting at C(-a,0) going towards D(0,b). The parametric equations can be written as x = -a + t(a), y = 0 + t(b), where t ranges from 0 to 1. When t=0, we are at C; t=1 at D. Now, point A is on this line. So there exists some parameter t where x=0, y=0. So substituting x=0: -a + t*a = 0 → t = 1. But at t=1, y-coordinate is b. So y=0 implies that b=0, which would mean D is at (0,0), same as A. But that's not possible since AD has length 8. Therefore, this leads to inconsistency. 

Alternatively, maybe point A is not between C and D. Suppose point A is extended beyond D. Let me think. Let's say line CD is extended beyond D to point A. Wait, but then line CA would go from C to A, passing through D. In that case, line CA and line AD would be colinear. Again, leading to the same problem. 

Alternatively, maybe line CD is not straight? Not possible. 

Wait, perhaps the line CD is not the same as line CA and AD? No, because point A is on line CD. 

I must be missing something here. Let me try again. Let me forget about coordinates and think geometrically. We have four points: C, A, D, B. Given that CA = 28, AD = 8, CB = 30, BD = y. Right angle at A between CA and AD. Also, point A is on line CD, and lines CA and AD are perpendicular. 

Wait, perhaps the lines CA and AD are not parts of line CD, but instead, line CA and line AD are two different lines intersecting at A, forming a right angle, while point A lies on line CD. So line CD is separate from lines CA and AD. But how? If point A is on line CD, then line CD must pass through A. So line CD is a line that passes through A, and lines CA and AD are two lines starting at A, perpendicular to each other. But then line CD would have to be a combination of lines CA and AD? No, that doesn't make sense. 

Wait, perhaps line CD is not connected to CA and AD. Wait, but point A is on line CD. So line CD must pass through A. Therefore, line CD intersects lines CA and AD at point A. But lines CA and AD are perpendicular. So line CD passes through A, and at point A, it forms a right angle with itself? No, that's not possible. 

Wait, this seems like a paradox. How can a single line CD pass through A, and have two directions (CA and AD) that are perpendicular? It's impossible unless CD is a line that is split into two perpendicular directions at point A, which is not possible for a straight line. 

Therefore, the only way this works is if line CD is not straight, which is not allowed. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding. Let me read the problem again carefully. 

Ah! Wait, the Perpendicular(Line(C,A), Line(A,D)) — does that mean that line CA is perpendicular to line AD? Yes. But if point A is on line CD, then line CD contains A. So line CA is a subset of line CD, and line AD is another subset of line CD. Therefore, they are colinear, hence cannot be perpendicular. 

This seems impossible. But the problem gives these conditions, so there must be a resolution. Let me try to think of another possibility. What if line CD is not a straight line? But lines are straight. 

Wait, maybe the problem is referring to line segments rather than infinite lines. So, line CA is a segment from C to A, and line AD is a segment from A to D. Even if A is on line CD, the segments CA and AD could be perpendicular. But if A is on line CD, then the segments CA and AD lie on the same line CD, so they are colinear, hence can't be perpendicular. 

Unless... wait, maybe line CD is not straight. But lines are straight. 

I'm stuck. Let me try looking at the answer choices. The options are 8, 9, 12, 15. Maybe I can use Pythagoras even though I don't know the configuration. 

Given that there's a right angle at A between CA and AD, so triangle CAD is a right triangle with legs CA=28 and AD=8. Wait, if that were the case, then CD would be hypotenuse sqrt(28² + 8²) = sqrt(784 + 64) = sqrt(848) ≈ 29.12. But point B is involved too. CB is 30, BD is y. Maybe triangle CBD? But I don't see the connection yet. 

Wait, if I assume that triangle CAD is right-angled at A, then CD^2 = CA^2 + AD^2. So CD = sqrt(28² + 8²) = sqrt(784 + 64) = sqrt(848). Simplify sqrt(848): 848 = 16*53, so sqrt(16*53)=4√53. 

Now, point B is somewhere. Given that CB=30 and BD=y. But how is point B related to the rest? The problem mentions point B, but I haven't used that yet. Wait, the problem didn't specify where B is located. So maybe there's more to the diagram. 

Wait, the problem mentions PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(C,D)), which is already covered. Are there any other relations involving B? The given predicates include Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,B)),30), and we need to find BD=y. So, perhaps point B is somewhere such that CB=30 and BD=y, and maybe B is related to triangle CAD? 

Maybe triangle CBD? If we can find relations between CB, BD, and CD. Let me think. If we can express CD in terms of CB and BD, but we don't know where B is. 

Wait, but if B is on line CD? Or is it somewhere else? The problem doesn't specify. Hmm. Without knowing the position of B, it's hard to proceed. 

Wait, perhaps there's a right triangle involving B? Like, if B is connected to other points? The problem doesn't give any information about angles involving B, except for the initial ones. 

Wait, the only given predicates are about lengths and angles at A. Maybe there's a right triangle involving B? 

Alternatively, maybe triangle ABC or ABD? But without more information, it's unclear. 

Wait, perhaps there's a way to relate CB and BD via the right triangle. If I assume that point B lies on line CD, then CB + BD = CD, or |CB - BD| = CD depending on the position. But we know CD is sqrt(848) ≈ 29.12. But CB is 30, which is longer than CD. So if B is on line CD, then CB would be either CD + DB or something else. Wait, but if B is on line CD extended beyond D, then CB = CD + DB. So 30 = CD + y. But CD is approx 29.12, so y would be about 0.88, which is not among the options. 

Alternatively, if B is on the extension of CD beyond C, then CB = CD + DC? No, that wouldn't make sense. 

Alternatively, maybe B is not on line CD. Then, how can we relate CB and BD? 

Wait, but without more information about angles or other sides, it's impossible to determine. 

But the problem must have enough information. Let me reconsider the earlier assumption that triangle CAD is right-angled. Even though there's a conflict with the positioning of A on line CD, maybe the problem assumes that despite the apparent contradiction, we can still apply the Pythagorean theorem. 

Assuming that CAD is a right triangle with legs 28 and 8, then CD = sqrt(28² + 8²) = sqrt(784 + 64) = sqrt(848). Now, if point B is such that CB=30 and BD=y, and assuming that B lies on line CD, then CD = |CB - BD| or CD = CB + BD depending on the location of B. 

But CD is approximately 29.12. CB is 30, which is slightly larger. So if B is on the line CD extended beyond D, then CB = CD + DB => 30 = sqrt(848) + y => y = 30 - sqrt(848). Calculate sqrt(848): 29.12, so y ≈ 0.88, which is not an option. 

Alternatively, if B is on the extension of CD beyond C, then CB = DB - CD => 30 = y - sqrt(848) => y = 30 + sqrt(848) ≈ 59.12, which is not an option. 

So this approach doesn't fit the answer choices. Therefore, my assumption that triangle CAD is right-angled must be incorrect. 

Wait, but the problem says that Angle(C,A,D) is a right angle. So that's the angle at A between CA and AD. So triangle CAD is right-angled at A. So CA=28, AD=8, and CD is hypotenuse. So CD=sqrt(28²+8²)=sqrt(848). 

Now, if point B is somewhere such that CB=30, and BD=y, but how? Maybe triangle CBD? If we can find some relation between CB, BD, and CD. 

Wait, if B is not on line CD, then we need more information. But the problem doesn't provide any. 

Wait, maybe there's a right triangle involving B? For instance, if AB is perpendicular to something? The problem doesn't state anything about B's position. 

Wait, the problem only provides certain predicates, and I've used all of them except for the fact that CB=30. So maybe there's a way to connect B with the existing points. 

Wait, maybe B is connected to A or D? The problem doesn't say. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a right triangle involving B and the right angle at A. For example, if AB is a leg or hypotenuse. But without information about AB, it's hard to say. 

Wait, but the problem gives LengthOf(Line(C,B)) = 30. So CB=30. If we can relate CB to other sides. 

Let me try to think of coordinates again. Let's assign coordinates to make it work. Assume A is at (0,0). Since Angle CAD is right, let's put C at (-28, 0) and D at (0, 8), making CA=28 and AD=8. Then line CD goes from C(-28,0) to D(0,8). The equation of line CD is y = (8/28)x + 0, simplifying to y = (2/7)x. 

Now, point A(0,0) lies on this line, which it does. Now, we need to find point B such that CB=30 and BD=y. 

So point B is somewhere such that its distance from C(-28,0) is 30, and its distance from D(0,8) is y. 

We need to find y. But there are infinitely many points B satisfying CB=30. However, perhaps there's more constraints? The problem doesn't mention any other conditions on B, so this seems underdetermined. 

Wait, but the problem must have sufficient information. Maybe there's a property I missed. Let me check the given predicates again. 

The given predicates are: 
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,A)),28)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,D)),8)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,B)),30)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,D)),y)
- RightAngle(Angle(C,A,D))
- PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(C,D))
- Perpendicular(Line(C,A), Line(A,D))

Wait, I think I missed that Perpendicular(Line(C,A), Line(A,D)) implies that lines CA and AD are perpendicular, which we already used to form the right triangle. 

But in this coordinate setup, line CA is from C(-28,0) to A(0,0), which is horizontal, and line AD is from A(0,0) to D(0,8), which is vertical. They are perpendicular, as required. 

Now, point B is somewhere such that CB=30. Let's find coordinates of B. 

Coordinates of C are (-28,0). Let B=(x,y). Then distance from C to B is sqrt[(x+28)^2 + (y-0)^2] = 30. So (x+28)^2 + y^2 = 900. 

Also, distance from B to D(0,8) is sqrt[(x-0)^2 + (y-8)^2] = y. So x^2 + (y-8)^2 = y^2. Expanding this: x^2 + y^2 - 16y + 64 = y^2 ⇒ x^2 -16y +64 = 0 ⇒ x^2 = 16y -64. 

Now, substitute x^2 into the first equation: 

(x+28)^2 + y^2 = 900  
Expand (x+28)^2 = x^2 + 56x + 784  
So x^2 + 56x + 784 + y^2 = 900  
From above, x^2 = 16y -64. Substitute:  
(16y -64) + 56x + 784 + y^2 = 900  
Combine terms: 16y -64 + 56x + 784 + y^2 = 900  
Simplify constants: -64 + 784 = 720  
So 16y + 56x + 720 + y^2 = 900  
Rearrange: y^2 + 16y + 56x + 720 - 900 = 0  
Which becomes y^2 + 16y + 56x - 180 = 0  

But we have x^2 = 16y -64, so x = ±√(16y -64). This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way. 

Wait, we have x^2 = 16y -64. Let's plug this into the expanded equation. 

Original equation after substitution was:  
y^2 + 16y + 56x + 720 - 900 = 0  
Wait, no, earlier steps had:  
After expanding, we had:  
16y + 56x + 720 + y^2 = 900  
So rearranged: y^2 + 16y + 56x + 720 = 900  
=> y^2 + 16y + 56x = 180  

But we also know x^2 = 16y -64. Let's try to express x in terms of y. From x^2 = 16y -64, so x = sqrt(16y -64) or x = -sqrt(16y -64). 

But this introduces square roots, which may complicate things. Let me think if there's another approach. 

Alternatively, since we have x^2 = 16y -64, let's substitute this into the equation y^2 + 16y + 56x = 180. 

But we still have x in there. Maybe express x from x^2 = 16y -64 as x = (something)? Not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that B lies somewhere, and we need to find y. But since there are infinitely many solutions, perhaps there's an additional constraint I missed. 

Wait, but the problem doesn't mention any other conditions. Maybe there's an implicit condition that B lies on line CD? If so, then we can find B on line CD. Let me check that. 

If B lies on line CD, then its coordinates satisfy the line equation y = (2/7)x. 

Substitute y = (2/7)x into x^2 = 16y -64. 

So x^2 = 16*(2/7)x -64  
Multiply both sides by 7: 7x^2 = 32x - 448  
Bring all terms to left: 7x^2 -32x +448 = 0  

Solve quadratic equation: discriminant D = 32² - 4*7*448  
Calculate D: 1024 - 4*7*448 = 1024 - 28*448. Let's compute 28*448: 28*400=11200, 28*48=1344 → total 11200+1344=12544. So D = 1024 - 12544 = -11520 < 0. No real solutions. 

So no real solutions for B on line CD. Hence, B is not on line CD. 

Thus, this approach isn't working. Maybe there's another way. 

Alternatively, since we have CB=30, and we know coordinates of C and D, perhaps there's a relationship between B and other points. 

But without more info, it's tricky. Wait, but maybe triangle CBD is a right triangle? Or some other relation? 

Alternatively, perhaps using the Law of Cosines in triangle CBD. But we need an angle. 

Wait, but we don't know any angles involving B. 

Wait, but maybe there's a right triangle involving B. For example, if AB is perpendicular to something? 

Wait, the problem doesn't mention any other right angles. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming coordinates. Let me try again. 

Let me consider the right triangle CAD with CA=28, AD=8, right angle at A. So CD=sqrt(28²+8²)=sqrt(848). Now, point B is such that CB=30. Let me consider triangle CBA or something. 

But without knowing AB or other sides, it's difficult. 

Wait, maybe the key is that point A lies on line CD, and lines CA and AD are perpendicular. So even though line CD is straight, the segments CA and AD are perpendicular. This is possible only if line CD is not straight, but that's impossible. 

Wait, but perhaps the lines CA and AD are not parts of line CD, but instead, line CA and line AD are perpendicular, and point A is on line CD. So line CD is not the same as lines CA and AD. For example, line CD is a different line passing through A, while lines CA and AD are two perpendicular lines at A. 

In this case, point A is on line CD, and lines CA and AD are perpendicular. So line CD is a line passing through A, and lines CA and AD are two perpendicular lines through A, not necessarily aligned with CD. 

Wait, this makes sense! Line CD is a line passing through A, but lines CA and AD are two different lines through A, perpendicular to each other. So line CD is not the same as lines CA or AD. 

Wait, but how can point A be on line CD, and lines CA and AD be perpendicular? Let me clarify. 

If line CD is a line passing through A, and lines CA and AD are two different lines starting at A, perpendicular to each other. So line CD is just a line that passes through A, and CA and AD are two perpendicular lines from A, not necessarily aligned with CD. 

Ah! This resolves the contradiction. So line CD is a line passing through A, but lines CA and AD are two different lines starting at A, forming a right angle. So point C is on line CA, point D is on line AD, and line CD passes through A. 

So, for example, imagine point A at the origin. Line CA is along the x-axis, line AD is along the y-axis. Line CD is a line passing through A, but not necessarily aligned with the axes. Wait, but if line CD passes through A, then it can be any line through A. However, points C and D are on lines CA and AD respectively. 

Wait, this is getting clearer. So, line CD is a line that passes through A, but points C and D are on lines CA and AD, which are perpendicular. So, for example, line CD could be any line through A, but points C and D are chosen such that C is on line CA (which is one direction from A), and D is on line AD (another direction from A). 

With this understanding, we can model this scenario. Let's assign coordinates again. Let me place point A at (0,0). Let line CA be the x-axis, so point C is at (-28,0) since CA=28. Line AD is perpendicular to CA, so it's the y-axis. Point D is at (0,8) since AD=8. Now, line CD connects points C(-28,0) and D(0,8). The equation of line CD is y = (2/7)x. 

Now, point B is such that CB=30 and BD=y. We need to find y. 

So, point B is somewhere in the plane such that its distance from C(-28,0) is 30, and its distance from D(0,8) is y. To find y, we need to determine the location of B. 

But without additional constraints, there are infinitely many points B satisfying CB=30. However, the problem must have a unique answer, so there must be an implied constraint. 

Wait, perhaps point B lies on line CD? Let me check. If B is on line CD, then its coordinates satisfy y = (2/7)x. Let's find such points B that are at distance 30 from C(-28,0).

Let me parameterize line CD. Points on line CD can be expressed as (t, (2/7)t), where t is a parameter. 

Distance from C(-28,0) to B(t, (2/7)t) is sqrt[(t + 28)^2 + ((2/7)t - 0)^2] = sqrt[(t + 28)^2 + (4t²)/49] = 30. Squaring both sides: (t + 28)^2 + (4t²)/49 = 900. Multiply through by 49 to eliminate denominator: 49(t + 28)^2 + 4t² = 49*900. Expand:

49(t² + 56t + 784) + 4t² = 44100  
49t² + 2744t + 38416 + 4t² = 44100  
Combine like terms: 53t² + 2744t + 38416 - 44100 = 0  
Calculate constant term: 38416 - 44100 = -5684  
So equation: 53t² + 2744t - 5684 = 0  

Solving this quadratic for t: 

Discriminant D = (2744)^2 - 4*53*(-5684)  
Calculate D: 2744^2 is large. Let me approximate or see if there's a factor. But this seems complex. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler approach. Let me calculate the distance from C to D. CD is sqrt((28)^2 + (8)^2) = sqrt(848). As before. 

If B is on line CD, then CB + BD = CD or |CB - BD| = CD depending on the side. But CB=30, and CD≈29.12, so CB > CD. Hence, B is on the extension of CD beyond D. So CB = CD + DB => 30 = CD + y => y = 30 - CD. 

CD = sqrt(28² + 8²) = sqrt(784 + 64) = sqrt(848). 

So y = 30 - sqrt(848). Let me compute sqrt(848):

sqrt(848) = sqrt(16*53) = 4*sqrt(53) ≈ 4*7.28 = 29.12. 

So y ≈ 30 - 29.12 = 0.88. But none of the answer choices are close to this. The options are 8, 9, 12, 15. None match. 

This suggests that B is not on line CD. 

Alternative idea: Maybe triangle CBD is a right triangle? Let's assume that. If angle at B is right, or at C or D. 

But without knowing, it's guesswork. 

Wait, but the problem gives CB=30, BD=y, and we need to find y. If we can relate CB and BD via some geometric property. 

Wait, perhaps using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle CBD? If it's a right triangle. 

But how? We need to know which angle is right. 

Alternatively, since we have a right triangle CAD, and CB=30, which is longer than CD≈29.12, maybe B is positioned such that triangle CDB is a right triangle. 

For example, if angle at D is right, then CB² = CD² + DB². But CB=30, CD≈29.12, so 30² = CD² + y² => 900 = 848 + y² => y² = 52 => y≈7.21, not matching answers. 

Or if angle at C is right: DB² = CD² + CB² => y² = 848 + 900 = 1748 → y≈41.8, nope. 

If angle at B is right: CD² = CB² + DB² → 848 = 900 + y² → y² = -52, impossible. 

No luck. 

Another approach: Using coordinates, with B anywhere, and finding y. 

We have from earlier: x^2 = 16y -64 and the equation from CB=30: (x+28)^2 + y^2 = 900. 

Let me expand (x+28)^2 + y^2 = 900:  
x² + 56x + 784 + y² = 900  
Replace x² with 16y -64:  
16y -64 + 56x + 784 + y² = 900  
Simplify: 16y + 56x + 720 + y² = 900  
So y² + 16y + 56x = 180. 

But x² = 16y -64. Let me try to eliminate x. From x² = 16y -64, we get x = ±√(16y -64). 

Substituting into the previous equation: y² + 16y + 56*(±√(16y -64)) = 180. 

This looks complex, but perhaps we can find integer solutions. Let's assume y is one of the answer choices: 8, 9, 12, 15. Let's test each. 

Test y=15: 

Check if 16y -64 >=0 → 16*15 -64 = 240-64=176 ≥0. Okay. 

Then x² = 176 → x=±√176=±4√11. 

Now, substitute into y² + 16y + 56x = 180: 

y=15: 15² + 16*15 + 56x = 225 + 240 + 56x = 465 + 56x = 180 → 56x = -285 → x = -285/56 ≈ -5.09. 

But x² = 176 → x = ±~13.26. So -285/56 ≈ -5.09 ≠ ±13.26. Not valid. 

Next, y=12: 

16*12 -64 = 192-64=128 ≥0. x²=128 → x=±8√2 ≈ ±11.31. 

Substitute into equation: y² +16y +56x = 144 + 192 +56x = 336 +56x = 180 → 56x = -156 → x = -156/56 = -39/14 ≈ -2.79. But x should be ±11.31. Not matching. 

Next, y=9: 

16*9 -64 = 144-64=80 ≥0. x²=80 → x=±4√5 ≈ ±8.94. 

Substitute into equation: 81 + 144 +56x = 225 +56x = 180 → 56x = -45 → x = -45/56 ≈ -0.80. But x should be ±8.94. No match. 

Finally, y=8: 

16*8 -64 = 128-64=64 ≥0. x²=64 → x=±8. 

Substitute into equation: y² +16y +56x = 64 + 128 +56x = 192 +56x = 180 → 56x = -12 → x = -12/56 = -3/14 ≈ -0.214. But x should be ±8. Not matching. 

None of these work. So no solution with y being one of the options. 

This suggests that there's a mistake in my assumptions. Maybe the right angle is not at A? Wait, no, the problem says RightAngle(Angle(C,A,D)), so it's at A. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the coordinates. Let me double-check. 

If line CA is horizontal, AD is vertical, then line CD goes from C(-28,0) to D(0,8). Correct. Distance CD is sqrt(28² +8²). Correct. 

Point B is such that CB=30. 

But if I choose B such that it forms a right triangle with C and D? For example, if B is such that triangle CBD is right-angled at B. Then, by Pythagoras: CB² + BD² = CD². But CB=30, CD= sqrt(848), so 30² + y² = 848 → 900 + y² = 848 → y² = -52, which is impossible. 

Alternatively, if right-angled at C: BD² = CB² + CD² → y² = 30² + (sqrt(848))^2 = 900 + 848 = 1748 → y = sqrt(1748) ≈ 41.8, not in options. 

If right-angled at D: CB² = CD² + BD² → 900 = 848 + y² → y = sqrt(52) ≈ 7.21, not in options. 

No luck. 

Perhaps there's a different approach. Let's recall that in the beginning, we thought there was a contradiction, but now with the corrected understanding that line CD is a separate line through A, and lines CA and AD are perpendicular, we can proceed. 

Let me try using vector approaches. Let me define vectors. Let me set A at origin (0,0). Vector AC is along x-axis, so C is at (-28,0). Vector AD is along y-axis, so D is at (0,8). Line CD passes through A, so it's the line joining C(-28,0) and D(0,8). 

Now, point B is such that CB=30 and BD=y. Let me represent B as (x,y). 

Distance from C(-28,0) to B(x,y) is sqrt((x+28)^2 + (y-0)^2) = 30. 

Distance from D(0,8) to B(x,y) is sqrt((x-0)^2 + (y-8)^2) = y. 

So, squaring both equations: 

(x + 28)^2 + y^2 = 900 ...(1)

x^2 + (y - 8)^2 = y^2 ...(2)

From equation (2): x^2 + y^2 - 16y + 64 = y^2 → x^2 -16y +64 = 0 → x^2 = 16y -64 ...(3)

Substitute x^2 from (3) into (1):

(x + 28)^2 + y^2 = 900  
Expand (x + 28)^2 = x^2 + 56x + 784  
So, x^2 + 56x + 784 + y^2 = 900  
Using x^2 = 16y -64:  
16y -64 + 56x + 784 + y^2 = 900  
Combine constants: -64 + 784 = 720  
So: 16y + 56x + y^2 + 720 = 900  
→ y^2 + 16y + 56x = 180 ...(4)

Now, from (3): x^2 = 16y -64 → x = ±sqrt(16y -64). Let's substitute this into (4). 

But this results in an equation with square root, which is complex. Let me try to find y such that this holds. 

Let me assume that x is positive or negative. Let me try to express x from (3) as x = sqrt(16y -64) or x = -sqrt(...). Let's take x = sqrt(16y -64). 

Substitute into (4): y^2 + 16y + 56*sqrt(16y -64) = 180. 

This is a complex equation, but perhaps we can guess y from the answer choices. Let's try y=15: 

Left side: 15^2 + 16*15 + 56*sqrt(16*15 -64) = 225 + 240 + 56*sqrt(240-64) = 465 + 56*sqrt(176) ≈ 465 + 56*13.26 ≈ 465 + 743 = 1208 ≠ 180. Too big. 

Try y=12: 144 + 192 + 56*sqrt(192-64) = 336 + 56*sqrt(128) ≈ 336 + 56*11.31 ≈ 336 + 633 = 969 ≠ 180. 

y=9: 81 + 144 + 56*sqrt(144-64) = 225 + 56*sqrt(80) ≈ 225 + 56*8.94 ≈ 225 + 499 = 724 ≠ 180. 

y=8: 64 + 128 + 56*sqrt(128-
