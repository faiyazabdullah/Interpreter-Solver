====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the side length of a square inscribed in a circle with an area of 18π square units. The answer choices are A through D. Let me think through how to approach this.

First, I remember that when a square is inscribed in a circle, the diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle. That seems crucial here. Because if I can find the radius of the circle, then double it to get the diameter, which would be the diagonal of the square. Then, using the relationship between the diagonal and the side of the square, I can find the side length.

Let me start by recalling the formula for the area of a circle. The area is πr², where r is the radius. The problem states the area is 18π. So, setting up the equation πr² = 18π. Dividing both sides by π gives r² = 18, so r = √18. Simplifying √18, that's √(9*2) which is 3√2. Therefore, the radius is 3√2 units. 

Wait, but the diameter would then be twice that, so 2*(3√2) = 6√2. But wait, the diameter is the diagonal of the square. Now, for a square, the diagonal d relates to the side length s by the formula d = s√2. So if the diagonal is 6√2, then we can set up the equation s√2 = 6√2. Dividing both sides by √2 gives s = 6. So the side length should be 6 units. Let me check that again.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me verify each step. Starting with the area of the circle: Area = πr² = 18π ⇒ r²=18 ⇒ r=√18=3√2. Correct. Diameter is 2r, so 2*3√2=6√2. Then, for the square, diagonal equals diameter. For a square, diagonal is s√2. So solving for s: s = diagonal / √2 = (6√2)/√2 = 6. Yes, that simplifies correctly. So the side length is 6. Looking at the answer choices, choice C is 6. So the answer should be C.

But let me make sure there isn't another way this could be approached. Maybe using coordinates? Suppose the square is centered at the origin of the circle. The vertices of the square would lie on the circle. For example, if the square has side length s, then the distance from the center to each vertex (the radius) would be half the diagonal. Which again leads us to the same conclusion. So yes, regardless of method, the side length comes out to 6. Therefore, the correct answer is C.
