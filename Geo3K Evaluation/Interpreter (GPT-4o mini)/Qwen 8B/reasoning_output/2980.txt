Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out what they mean. Let me start by listing them out again to make sure I don't miss anything.

So, the given predicates are:

1. Circle(X) – So X is a circle.
2. PointLiesOnCircle(Point(Y), Circle(X)) – Point Y lies on circle X.
3. PointLiesOnCircle(Point(Z), Circle(X)) – Similarly, point Z also lies on circle X.
4. IsRadiusOf(Line(X,Y), Circle(X)) – The line segment XY is a radius of circle X.
5. Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(Y,X,Z)),75) – The measure of angle YXZ is 75 degrees.
6. LengthOf(Line(X,Y)) = 6 – The length of line segment XY is 6 units.

The question asks for the length of arc ZY, rounded to the nearest hundredth. The options are A. 3.93, B. 6.00, C. 7.85, D. 15.71.

Alright, so first, since points Y and Z are both on circle X, and XY is a radius, that means that XY is a radius of the circle. Therefore, the radius of the circle is 6 units because the length of XY is 6. Since it's a radius, the diameter would be 12. But we need the length of arc ZY. 

Now, angle at X (angle YXZ) is 75 degrees. Wait, but angle YXZ is formed by points Y, X, Z. Since X is the center of the circle (because XY is a radius, and the other radius would be XZ if Z were another radius. Wait, but Z is just a point on the circle. Hmm. Wait, maybe not necessarily. Wait, if X is the center, then both Y and Z lie on the circumference, so XY and XZ are radii. So angle YXZ is the central angle between points Y and Z. Because if X is the center, then angle at X between Y and Z is a central angle. That makes sense. So the measure of the central angle is 75 degrees. Then, the arc length between Y and Z would be the central angle multiplied by the radius, divided by 180? Or wait, the formula for arc length is θ times r, where θ is in radians. Right, arc length s = rθ, where θ is in radians. So first, convert 75 degrees to radians. 

But let me confirm. Central angle in radians is θ = π/180 * degrees. So 75 degrees is 75π/180 radians, which simplifies to 5π/12 radians. Then, arc length would be r * θ. Since radius r is 6, so 6 * 5π/12. Let me compute that. 

First, simplify 6*(5π)/12. The 6 and 12 can be reduced: 6/12 is 1/2, so 1/2*5π = 5π/2 ≈ 5 * 3.1416 / 2. Let me calculate that. 5 * 3.1416 is about 15.708, divided by 2 gives approximately 7.854. Rounded to the nearest hundredth, that's 7.85. Which is option C. 

Wait, but let me check if there's any mistake here. For example, is angle YXZ indeed the central angle? Because X is the center of the circle, since XY is a radius. So yes, if X is the center, then the angle at X between Y and Z is the central angle. Therefore, the arc length should correspond to that angle. 

Alternatively, could there be a misunderstanding in the setup? Let me recheck the predicates. The Line(X,Y) is a radius, so X is the center. Points Y and Z are on the circle. Therefore, XY and XZ are radii. Thus, angle YXZ is the central angle between Y and Z. Therefore, the arc length from Y to Z is indeed 75 degrees, converted to radians, multiplied by radius. 

Calculating that again: 75 degrees in radians is 75 × π/180 = 5π/12. Multiply by radius 6: 6 × 5π/12 = (6/12)*5π = 0.5 × 5π = 2.5π. Numerically, 2.5 × 3.14159... equals approximately 7.85398..., which rounds to 7.85. So option C is correct. 

Looking at the answer choices, option C is 7.85. Therefore, the answer should be C.
