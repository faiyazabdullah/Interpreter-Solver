Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a rectangle LMNP and a parallelogram LKJM. The given information includes LN = 10, LJ = 2x + 1, and PJ = 3x - 1. We need to find the value of x. The answer choices are A. 2, B. 4, C. 5, D. 10.

First, I should recall the properties of rectangles and parallelograms. A rectangle has opposite sides equal and all angles are right angles. Also, the diagonals of a rectangle are equal in length and bisect each other. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel, and the diagonals bisect each other but aren't necessarily equal unless it's a rectangle.

Looking at the given points and lines: Points P, N, M, L form a rectangle, so LMNP is a rectangle. That means LM is parallel and equal to NP, and LP is parallel and equal to MN. Also, the diagonals of the rectangle would be LN and PM. Wait, since it's a rectangle, the diagonals should be equal. But the problem mentions LN = 10, so the diagonal LN is 10 units long.

Then there's a parallelogram LKJM. So points L, K, J, M form a parallelogram. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. So LK equals MJ, and LJ equals KM. Also, the diagonals of the parallelogram (like LK and JM?) Wait, maybe I should clarify the structure here. Let me sketch mentally.

Wait, the lines mentioned include Line(N,I), Line(I,K), Line(K,M). So point I is connected to N and K, and K is connected to M. Also, there's a line from N to I, then I to K, then K to M. Since LKJM is a parallelogram, then sides LK and JM are one pair of opposite sides, and LJ and KM are another pair. Wait, but how does this fit with the rectangle?

Let me think again. The rectangle is LMNP. So points L, M, N, P are vertices of the rectangle. Then the parallelogram is LKJM. So L, K, J, M are the vertices of the parallelogram. Therefore, sides LK and JM are opposite, and sides LJ and KM are opposite. Also, since it's a parallelogram, LK is parallel and equal to JM, and LJ is parallel and equal to KM.

Now, the problem gives LN = 10. Since LMNP is a rectangle, LN is one of its diagonals. In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal, so the other diagonal PM should also be 10. Now, considering the coordinates or perhaps using the properties of the diagonals.

But how do LN and the other segments relate to the parallelogram? Let's see. The parallelogram is LKJM. So point J is part of this parallelogram. Maybe we need to find some relations between the diagonals or sides of the parallelogram and the rectangle.

Given that LJ = 2x + 1 and PJ = 3x - 1. Wait, PJ is a segment connecting P to J. Hmm. Let me try to visualize where point J is located. Since the parallelogram is LKJM, and we have lines like N-I-K-M, so point I is connected to N and K. Also, line I-K is part of the parallelogram? Or maybe not directly. Let me think about the connections.

From the given lines: Line(N,I), Line(I,K), Line(K,M). So starting from N, going to I, then to K, then to M. Also, there's Line(P,M) and Line(N,L). Wait, the original quadrilaterals are Quadrilateral(P,N,M,L) which is the rectangle, and Quadrilateral(N,I,K,M) which is the parallelogram. So the parallelogram NIKM? Wait, the problem says "parallelogram LKJM". Wait, maybe there's confusion here. Let me check again.

Original problem says: "Use rectangle LMNP, parallelogram LKJM to solve the problem." So the rectangle is LMNP, and the parallelogram is LKJM. So points L, K, J, M form the parallelogram. Therefore, sides LK, KJ, JM, ML. Wait, but ML is part of the rectangle LMNP. Since LMNP is a rectangle, ML is one of its sides. So ML is perpendicular to LM. 

In the parallelogram LKJM, since ML is one side, and LK is adjacent to L. So if ML is a side of the rectangle, then LK would be another side of the parallelogram. Since it's a parallelogram, LK is parallel and equal to JM. Also, in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. But maybe more importantly, the diagonals of the parallelogram split each other in half.

But how does this connect to the given lengths? Let me consider the diagonals of the parallelogram LKJM. The diagonals would be LJ and KM. Because in a parallelogram, the diagonals are the lines connecting opposite vertices. So in LKJM, the diagonals are L to J and K to M. Wait, if the parallelogram is LKJM, then the vertices are L, K, J, M connected in order. So the diagonals would be from L to J and from K to M. So these diagonals intersect each other at their midpoints.

But the problem states that LJ = 2x + 1. So LJ is one of the diagonals of the parallelogram. Also, the other diagonal is KM. However, in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other but aren't necessarily equal unless it's a rectangle. But since LKJM is a parallelogram, unless it's a rectangle, the diagonals are not equal. However, we don't know if it's a rectangle yet.

But wait, in the rectangle LMNP, the diagonals are LN and MP, which are equal. Given that LN is 10, so MP is also 10. Now, how does this relate to the parallelogram? Let me think about the position of point J. Since J is part of the parallelogram LKJM, and the line from N to I to K to M is present. Also, there's a line from K to M, which is part of the parallelogram.

Perhaps we need to use coordinates to model this. Let me assign coordinates to make it easier. Let's place the rectangle LMNP on a coordinate system. Let me assume that point L is at the origin (0,0). Since it's a rectangle, suppose LM is along the x-axis and LP is along the y-axis. Let me denote coordinates accordingly.

Let’s define:

- Point L: (0, 0)
- Since LMNP is a rectangle, let’s say point M is (a, 0) because LM is horizontal.
- Point P would be (0, b) since LP is vertical.
- Then point N would be (a, b) because completing the rectangle.

So the rectangle LMNP has coordinates:

L(0,0), M(a,0), N(a,b), P(0,b).

Now, the diagonals of the rectangle are LN and MP. The length of LN can be found using distance formula. From L(0,0) to N(a,b): sqrt[(a)^2 + (b)^2] = 10. So a² + b² = 100.

Now, the parallelogram LKJM. Let me think about where points K and J are. Since LKJM is a parallelogram, the vector from L to K should be equal to the vector from J to M. Also, the vector from K to J should be equal to the vector from L to M.

Alternatively, since in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. So LK is parallel and equal to MJ, and LJ is parallel and equal to KM.

But without knowing the exact positions, maybe we can use the fact that in the parallelogram LKJM, the diagonals bisect each other. So the midpoint of diagonal LJ should be the same as the midpoint of diagonal KM.

Also, the problem mentions line segments LJ and PJ. Let me note that PJ is given as 3x - 1. So point J is somewhere such that connecting P(0,b) to J gives a segment of length 3x - 1.

Additionally, LJ is given as 2x + 1. So the distance from L(0,0) to J is 2x + 1.

But to find coordinates of J, maybe we can express it in terms of variables. Let me attempt to parameterize point J.

Since LKJM is a parallelogram, vectors can help. Let me consider vectors. For example, in a parallelogram, the vector from L to K plus the vector from L to J equals the vector from L to M? Not sure. Alternatively, since in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, so the midpoint of LJ is the same as the midpoint of KM.

But we need to relate this to the existing rectangle.

Alternatively, since K is connected to M via line KM, and from the given lines, there's a line from N to I to K to M. So point I is connected to N and K. Maybe I is the intersection point of some lines? Or perhaps part of the construction of the parallelogram?

This seems complicated. Maybe instead of coordinates, think about properties.

Since LMNP is a rectangle, then LM is congruent to PN, and LP is congruent to MN. Also, the diagonals LN and MP are congruent and bisect each other. So their midpoints are the center of the rectangle.

Now, considering parallelogram LKJM. In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. So the midpoint of diagonal LJ is the same as the midpoint of diagonal KM. Let me denote that midpoint as O. Then O is the midpoint of both LJ and KM.

But how does this help us? Well, maybe we can find expressions for these midpoints.

But we also have the segment PJ, which connects point P to J. So if we can find coordinates of J, then compute PJ.

Alternatively, since we have two equations involving x: LJ = 2x + 1 and PJ = 3x - 1. If we can relate LJ and PJ somehow, maybe through coordinates or using properties of the parallelogram and rectangle.

Let me try coordinates again. Let me proceed with the earlier setup where:

L(0,0), M(a,0), N(a,b), P(0,b).

We need to find coordinates of J such that LKJM is a parallelogram. Let me assume that point K is somewhere. Since there's a line from N to I to K to M. Assuming that I is a point connected to N and K, but without more info, maybe I is the midpoint or something else. Alternatively, since line NKI is connected, perhaps I lies on NM or something. Wait, the line from N to I, then I to K, then K to M. So points N, I, K, M are colinear? No, because they're connected by lines NI, IK, KM. So N to I, I to K, K to M. So these three points N, I, K, M are connected in sequence, forming a broken line from N to M through I and K. But since K is part of the parallelogram LKJM, which connects to M.

Maybe I is the midpoint of NM? Or perhaps not. Without more info, it's hard to tell. Maybe we need another approach.

Alternatively, since LKJM is a parallelogram, then vector LK equals vector MJ. So if I can find coordinates for K and J, then...

But perhaps focusing on the diagonals of the parallelogram. In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. So midpoint of LJ is same as midpoint of KM. Let me write that down.

Let me denote coordinates:

Let’s suppose J has coordinates (p, q). Then the midpoint of LJ is ((p+0)/2, (q+0)/2) = (p/2, q/2).

Similarly, the midpoint of KM. Let me find coordinates of K and M. Point M is (a,0). Let me denote point K as (k_x, k_y). Then midpoint of KM is ((k_x + a)/2, (k_y + 0)/2) = ((k_x + a)/2, k_y / 2).

Setting these equal since they are midpoints of diagonals in the parallelogram:

p/2 = (k_x + a)/2 => p = k_x + a  
and  
q/2 = k_y / 2 => q = k_y  

Therefore, point K has coordinates (p - a, q). So once we know J(p,q), K is determined as (p - a, q). 

But how does this help? Also, since LKJM is a parallelogram, the vector from L to K should equal the vector from J to M. Vector LK is (k_x - 0, k_y - 0) = (k_x, k_y). Vector JM is (a - p, 0 - q). So setting them equal:

k_x = a - p  
k_y = -q  

But from earlier, we had k_x = p - a (from midpoint condition). Wait, substituting k_x from above:

From the midpoint equation: p = k_x + a → k_x = p - a. But from the vector equality: k_x = a - p. So combining:

p - a = a - p → 2p = 2a → p = a. 

So p = a. Which implies that the x-coordinate of J is a. Similarly, from the vector equality, k_y = -q. And from the midpoint condition, q = k_y. So q = -q → q = 0. Therefore, point J has coordinates (a, 0). Wait, but point M is at (a, 0). So J coincides with M? That can’t be right. There must be a mistake here.

Wait, let me re-examine. The vector LK equals vector JM. Vector LK is from L(0,0) to K(k_x, k_y): (k_x, k_y). Vector JM is from J(p,q) to M(a, 0): (a - p, 0 - q). So setting these equal:

k_x = a - p  
k_y = -q  

But earlier from the midpoint condition, we had p = k_x + a and q = k_y. Substituting k_x = a - p into p = k_x + a gives:

p = (a - p) + a → p = 2a - p → 2p = 2a → p = a. Then q = k_y. But from vector equality, k_y = -q. So q = -q ⇒ q=0. Hence, J is (a, 0), which is point M. But that would mean that the parallelogram LKJM collapses, which isn't possible. So there must be an error in my assumptions.

Ah! Perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the vector equality. In a parallelogram LKJM, the sides LK and MJ are equal and parallel, but the vectors might be different depending on the order of the vertices. Let me confirm the order of the parallelogram. It's LKJM, so the vertices are connected as L to K, K to J, J to M, M to L. So the sides are LK, KJ, JM, and ML. Therefore, the vector from L to K should equal the vector from J to M. Yes, because opposite sides are equal and parallel. So vector LK = vector JM. So yes, previous calculation holds. But this leads to J being at (a, 0), which conflicts with M. This suggests an inconsistency, implying that maybe my initial coordinate setup is missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the parallelogram is ordered differently. Maybe it's L, J, K, M? Wait, the problem states parallelogram LKJM. So the order is L-K-J-M-L? Or L-K-M-J? Wait, the name of the parallelogram is LKJM, so the vertices are L, K, J, M connected in order. So edges are LK, KJ, JM, and ML. Thus, sides LK and JM are opposite, and sides KJ and ML are opposite. Therefore, vector LK equals vector JM, and vector KJ equals vector ML.

Vector ML goes from M to L, which is (-a, 0) since M is (a,0) and L is (0,0). So vector ML is (-a, 0). Therefore, vector KJ should equal vector ML. Vector KJ is from K to J: (J_x - K_x, J_y - K_y) = (-a, 0). So if we can find coordinates for K and J such that this holds.

But previously, trying to find vector LK equals vector JM led to J being at M. This suggests that there may be an issue with the way I'm modeling the parallelogram. Let me try again.

Let me define vectors properly. In parallelogram LKJM, sides LK and JM are equal and parallel. So vector LK = vector JM. Vector LK is from L to K: K - L = (K_x, K_y). Vector JM is from J to M: M - J = (a - J_x, 0 - J_y). Setting these equal:

K_x = a - J_x  
K_y = -J_y  

So K_x + J_x = a  
K_y + J_y = 0  

Additionally, since sides KJ and ML are equal and parallel. Vector KJ is from K to J: J - K = (J_x - K_x, J_y - K_y). Vector ML is from M to L: L - M = (-a, 0). So:

J_x - K_x = -a  
J_y - K_y = 0  

From these equations:

From first equation: J_x - K_x = -a → J_x = K_x - a  
From second equation: J_y = K_y  

But from earlier, K_x = a - J_x → substitute J_x = K_x - a into this:

K_x = a - (K_x - a)  
K_x = a - K_x + a  
K_x + K_x = 2a  
2K_x = 2a → K_x = a  
Thus, J_x = a - a = 0. So J_x = 0. And from J_y = K_y. 

Now, from the earlier equation K_y + J_y = 0 → K_y = -J_y. But J_y = K_y → K_y = -K_y → 2K_y = 0 → K_y = 0. So J_y = 0. 

So point J has coordinates (0, 0)? But that's point L. That can't be right either. Clearly, there's a contradiction here, suggesting that my approach has a flaw. Maybe the order of the parallelogram is different? Like L, J, K, M? Let me try assuming the parallelogram is L, J, K, M. So the sides are LJ, JK, KM, ML. Then opposite sides are LJ and KM, and JK and ML. 

In that case, vector LJ equals vector KM. Vector LJ is J - L = (J_x, J_y). Vector KM is M - K = (a - K_x, 0 - K_y). So:

J_x = a - K_x  
J_y = -K_y  

Also, vector JK equals vector ML. Vector JK is K - J = (K_x - J_x, K_y - J_y). Vector ML is L - M = (-a, 0). So:

K_x - J_x = -a  
K_y - J_y = 0  

From first equation: K_x = J_x - a  
From second equation: K_y = J_y  

Substitute K_x into the first equation from vector LJ:

J_x = a - K_x = a - (J_x - a) → J_x = a - J_x + a → 2J_x = 2a → J_x = a. 

So J_x = a. Then K_x = a - a = 0. 

And from K_y = J_y. Also, from the vector LJ: J_y = -K_y → J_y = -K_y = -J_y → 2J_y = 0 → J_y = 0. So point J is (a, 0), which is point M again. Again, this results in J coinciding with M, which is impossible. 

Hmm, this suggests that my assumption about the order of the parallelogram might be incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the parallelogram is named differently. Let me check the original problem statement: "parallelogram LKJM". The order of the letters defines the sequence of vertices. So L-K-J-M-L. So the sides are LK, KJ, JM, ML. 

But according to this, when I tried to calculate, it resulted in J being at point M, which doesn't make sense. This indicates that perhaps there's an error in my coordinate setup or understanding of the diagram. 

Let me take a different approach. Let's forget coordinates for a moment. Since LMNP is a rectangle, LN is a diagonal of length 10. In the parallelogram LKJM, LJ is one of its diagonals, which is given as 2x + 1. Also, PJ is given as 3x - 1. 

If I can find a relationship between LJ, PJ, and the rectangle's diagonal LN, maybe through triangle properties or using the fact that certain points are connected. 

Note that point J is part of the parallelogram LKJM. If I can express PJ in terms of other segments, perhaps using the rectangle's properties. 

Alternatively, since PJ connects P to J, and P is a vertex of the rectangle, maybe triangle PLJ or something similar involves these segments. 

But without knowing where J is, it's challenging. However, since LKJM is a parallelogram, and L is a corner of the rectangle, maybe there's a relation between the diagonals of the parallelogram and the rectangle. 

Wait, in a parallelogram, the sum of the squares of the diagonals equals twice the sum of the squares of the sides. But I don't know the sides of the parallelogram. 

Alternatively, since LJ is a diagonal of the parallelogram, and if we could relate it to the rectangle's diagonal. But how?

Wait, if I consider that in the rectangle, LN is a diagonal of length 10. If J is some point such that PJ is given, and LJ is given, maybe triangle PLJ has sides LJ, PJ, and PL? Let me see. 

PL is a side of the rectangle. Since LMNP is a rectangle, PL is equal to MN. But without knowing the actual lengths of the sides of the rectangle, this might not help directly. 

But maybe using the Pythagorean theorem. If I can find that triangle PLJ is right-angled or something similar. 

Alternatively, since LN is a diagonal of the rectangle, and if J lies somewhere such that PJ and LJ are connected to it, maybe there's a way to use coordinates again. Let me try once more with coordinates, carefully.

Assume rectangle LMNP with L(0,0), M(a,0), N(a,b), P(0,b). Diagonal LN has length sqrt(a² + b²) = 10, so a² + b² = 100.

Now, parallelogram LKJM. Let's assume that J is a point such that LKJM is a parallelogram. Let me define J as (c,d). Then, since LKJM is a parallelogram, the vector from L to K must equal the vector from J to M. Vector LK = K - L = (k_x, k_y). Vector JM = M - J = (a - c, 0 - d). So:

k_x = a - c  
k_y = -d  

So point K is (a - c, -d). 

Now, since LKJM is a parallelogram, the vector from K to J must equal the vector from L to M. Vector KJ = J - K = (c - (a - c), d - (-d)) = (2c - a, 2d). Vector LM is M - L = (a, 0). These vectors should be equal for the parallelogram, so:

2c - a = a → 2c = 2a → c = a  
and  
2d = 0 → d = 0  

So c = a, d = 0. Therefore, point J is (a, 0), which is point M. Again, this suggests that J coincides with M, which is impossible. This implies that there's a fundamental issue with this setup, possibly due to misinterpretation of the parallelogram's configuration.

Wait, perhaps the parallelogram is not LKJM but LKMJ? Or maybe the order of the vertices is different. Let me try changing the order. Suppose the parallelogram is LKMJ, meaning vertices L, K, M, J. Then sides are LK, KM, MJ, JL. In this case, opposite sides would be LK and MJ, and KM and JL. 

Vector LK = K - L = (k_x, k_y). Vector MJ = J - M = (j_x - a, j_y - 0) = (j_x - a, j_y). Setting them equal: k_x = j_x - a, k_y = j_y. 

Vector KM = M - K = (a - k_x, 0 - k_y). Vector JL = L - J = (0 - j_x, 0 - j_y) = (-j_x, -j_y). Setting them equal: a - k_x = -j_x, 0 - k_y = -j_y → a - k_x = -j_x → j_x = k_x - a, and k_y = j_y.

From earlier, k_x = j_x - a. Substituting j_x = k_x - a into this gives k_x = (k_x - a) - a → k_x = k_x - 2a → 0 = -2a → a = 0. But a is the length of LM in the rectangle, which can't be zero. Contradiction again. 

This suggests that my approach is flawed. Perhaps the problem involves non-coplanar points or a different configuration. Alternatively, maybe the parallelogram shares a side with the rectangle. 

Wait, the parallelogram is LKJM. Since L and M are vertices of the rectangle, and J is another point. Maybe J is inside the rectangle? Or outside? Let me consider that.

Suppose J is a point such that LKJM is a parallelogram. Let me think of LKJM as having LM as one of its sides. Wait, if LM is a side of the rectangle and also a side of the parallelogram, then maybe LM is one side of the parallelogram. But the parallelogram is LKJM, so LM would be a diagonal or a side?

If LM is a side of the parallelogram, then LK and JM would be the other sides. But since LM is already a side of the rectangle, this might be possible. Let me try.

Assume LM is a side of the parallelogram LKJM. So sides LK and LM are adjacent sides of the parallelogram. Then, the other sides would be KJ and MJ. But this requires that LK and LM are both sides of the parallelogram. However, without knowing the exact configuration, it's still unclear. 

Alternatively, since the problem mentions line(N,I), line(I,K), line(K,M), maybe point I is the intersection of diagonals or something. Let me consider that. 

If I is a point on line NK, then perhaps I is the midpoint of NK? Or maybe it's related to the parallelogram's properties. But without more info, it's hard to tell. 

Alternatively, since we're given LJ and PJ, and LN is given, maybe there's a relationship between these segments. For instance, if we can express PJ in terms of LN and LJ. 

Let me consider triangle PLJ. If I can find the lengths of PL, LJ, and PJ, and use the Law of Cosines or something. But I need to know angles or other relations. 

Wait, PL is a side of the rectangle. Since LMNP is a rectangle, PL is equal to MN, which is equal to the length of LM. Wait, no. In rectangle LMNP, LM and PN are opposite sides, and LP and MN are opposite sides. So LM = PN and LP = MN. 

But without knowing the specific dimensions, I can't get numerical values. But maybe using the diagonal LN = 10. Since LN is the diagonal, and in the rectangle, LN^2 = LM^2 + LP^2 = a² + b² = 100. 

Now, if I can relate PJ and LJ to this. Let's think about point J. If J is somewhere such that LJ = 2x + 1 and PJ = 3x - 1, then perhaps there's a way to relate these distances using the rectangle's properties. 

For example, if J lies on a particular line or has a specific relationship with the rectangle. 

Wait, since LKJM is a parallelogram, and L and M are vertices of the rectangle, perhaps J is positioned such that PJ is a segment from P to J, and LJ is from L to J. Let me imagine that. 

If I consider triangle PLJ, with sides PL, LJ, and PJ. If I can express PL in terms of a and b, and relate it to LJ and PJ. 

But PL is the length from P(0,b) to L(0,0), which is b. So PL = b. 

If I can find expressions for LJ and PJ in terms of a, b, and x, and set up equations. 

But I need to find a relationship between LJ, PJ, and PL. Let me assume that in triangle PLJ, using the Law of Cosines:

PJ² = PL² + LJ² - 2 * PL * LJ * cos(theta), where theta is the angle between PL and LJ. 

But without knowing theta, this might not help. Unless there's a right angle involved. 

Wait, if angle at L is 90 degrees? Since LMNP is a rectangle, angle at L is 90 degrees. But is angle at L in triangle PLJ also 90 degrees? Not necessarily, unless J lies on a specific location. 

Alternatively, if J lies on the extension of some line. 

Another idea: Since LKJM is a parallelogram, and L and M are fixed points, then J is determined relative to K. But without knowing K's position, it's tricky. 

Wait, maybe there's a property I'm missing. In the rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other. If J is related to the midpoint of the diagonal or something. 

Alternatively, since LJ is a diagonal of the parallelogram, and in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. So the midpoint of LJ is the same as the midpoint of KM. 

Let me assume that. Let me call the midpoint O. So O is the midpoint of LJ and also the midpoint of KM. 

Point O has coordinates ((J_x + L_x)/2, (J_y + L_y)/2) = (J_x/2, J_y/2). 

Since O is also the midpoint of KM, and M is (a, 0), let's say K has coordinates (k_x, k_y). Then midpoint of KM is ((k_x + a)/2, (k_y + 0)/2) = ((k_x + a)/2, k_y/2). 

Setting equal to O: 

J_x/2 = (k_x + a)/2 → J_x = k_x + a  
J_y/2 = k_y/2 → J_y = k_y  

So J_x = k_x + a, J_y = k_y. 

Now, since LKJM is a parallelogram, vector LK = vector MJ. Vector LK is (k_x - 0, k_y - 0) = (k_x, k_y). Vector MJ is (J_x - a, J_y - 0) = (J_x - a, J_y). 

Setting equal: 

k_x = J_x - a  
k_y = J_y  

But from earlier, J_x = k_x + a → substitute k_x = J_x - a into this: 

J_x = (J_x - a) + a → J_x = J_x, which is always true. So no new info. 

But we also know that in the parallelogram, vector KJ = vector LM. Vector KJ is (J_x - k_x, J_y - k_y). Vector LM is (a - 0, 0 - 0) = (a, 0). So:

J_x - k_x = a  
J_y - k_y = 0  

From J_x = k_x + a, we have J_x - k_x = a, which matches. And J_y - k_y = 0 → J_y = k_y. 

So this gives no new constraints. 

Thus, we have J_x = k_x + a, J_y = k_y, and k_x = J_x - a, k_y = J_y. 

But without additional constraints, we cannot determine J's coordinates. This suggests that J can be anywhere such that these conditions are met, but we need to relate it to the given lengths LJ and PJ. 

Given that LJ = 2x + 1, and PJ = 3x - 1. Let's express these in terms of J's coordinates. 

LJ is the distance from L(0,0) to J(J_x, J_y): √(J_x² + J_y²) = 2x + 1. 

PJ is the distance from P(0,b) to J(J_x, J_y): √((J_x - 0)^2 + (J_y - b)^2) = √(J_x² + (J_y - b)^2) = 3x - 1. 

So we have two equations:

1. √(J_x² + J_y²) = 2x + 1  
2. √(J_x² + (J_y - b)^2) = 3x - 1  

Square both equations:

1. J_x² + J_y² = (2x + 1)^2 = 4x² + 4x + 1  
2. J_x² + (J_y - b)^2 = (3x - 1)^2 = 9x² - 6x + 1  

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

[J_x² + (J_y - b)^2] - [J_x² + J_y²] = (9x² - 6x + 1) - (4x² + 4x + 1)  
Expand left side: J_x² + J_y² - 2bJ_y + b² - J_x² - J_y² = -2bJ_y + b²  
Right side: 9x² -6x +1 -4x² -4x -1 = 5x² -10x  

So: -2bJ_y + b² = 5x² -10x  
Rearranged: -2bJ_y = 5x² -10x - b²  
→ J_y = [b² + 10x -5x²]/(2b)  

Now, from equation 1: J_x² + J_y² = 4x² +4x +1  
But we also know from the rectangle that a² + b² = 100. But we don't know a or b individually. 

However, we need another equation to relate these variables. But we don't have enough information unless we find a relationship between J_x and J_y through the parallelogram's properties. 

Recall that in the parallelogram LKJM, we have K_x = J_x - a and K_y = J_y. Also, since LKJM is a parallelogram, the vector from L to K must equal the vector from J to M. Wait, we've already used that to derive the relations. 

But perhaps there's another constraint from the parallelogram. For instance, the sides LK and JM must be equal in length. Wait, LK is from L(0,0) to K(J_x - a, J_y), so its length is √[(J_x - a)^2 + J_y^2]. JM is from J(J_x, J_y) to M(a,0), which is √[(a - J_x)^2 + (0 - J_y)^2], which is the same as LK. So this checks out. 

No new info. 

But we need to find x, and we have an expression for J_y in terms of x and b. But we don't know b. However, we might relate b to the rectangle's diagonal. 

From the rectangle, a² + b² = 100. But we don't know a or b. So unless we can find another equation involving a and b, we can't proceed. 

Wait, but maybe there's a way to eliminate a and b. Let me think. 

From the expression for J_y: J_y = [b² + 10x -5x²]/(2b)  

Let me denote this as J_y = (b²)/(2b) + (10x -5x²)/(2b) = b/2 + (10x -5x²)/(2b). 

But this seems too abstract. Perhaps there's another relation. 

Let me go back to the equations. From equation 1: J_x² + J_y² = 4x² +4x +1  
From equation 2: J_x² + (J_y - b)^2 = 9x² -6x +1  
Subtracting gave us the expression for J_y. 

But if I can express J_x² from equation 1: J_x² = 4x² +4x +1 - J_y². Substitute into equation 2: 

[4x² +4x +1 - J_y²] + (J_y - b)^2 = 9x² -6x +1  
Expand (J_y - b)^2: J_y² - 2bJ_y + b²  
So total: 4x² +4x +1 - J_y² + J_y² - 2bJ_y + b² = 9x² -6x +1  
Simplify: 4x² +4x +1 - 2bJ_y + b² = 9x² -6x +1  
Cancel 1 from both sides: 4x² +4x - 2bJ_y + b² = 9x² -6x  
Rearrange: -2bJ_y + b² = 5x² -10x  
Which is the same as before. 

So no progress here. 

But we need another equation. Perhaps from the parallelogram's properties. Let me recall that in the parallelogram, the sides LK and JM are equal, and the sides KJ and ML are equal. 

Length of LK: √[(J_x - a)^2 + J_y^2]  
Length of JM: √[(a - J_x)^2 + (0 - J_y)^2] = same as LK. So no new info. 

Length of KJ: √[(J_x - (J_x - a))^2 + (J_y - J_y)^2] = √[a² + 0] = a  
Length of ML: √[(a - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2] = a. So this checks out. 

So KJ = ML = a. 

But how does this help? If I can find a in terms of x or b? 

Not directly. 

Wait, but in the rectangle, a² + b² = 100. If I can find a relationship between a and b using the expressions for J_y. 

From earlier, J_y = [b² + 10x -5x²]/(2b) = b/2 + (10x -5x²)/(2b). 

But I don't see how to proceed without more info. 

Maybe assume that J lies on a specific line or has specific coordinates. For example, if J is vertically aligned with P or something. 

Alternatively, consider that in the parallelogram LKJM, the diagonals are LJ and KM. The length of the diagonals in a parallelogram satisfy the relation: 

diagonal1² + diagonal2² = 2*(side1² + side2²)  

But we only know one diagonal, LJ = 2x + 1. If we could find the other diagonal KM, then we could relate it. 

But KM is from K to M. Earlier, we had K_x = J_x - a and K_y = J_y. So coordinates of K are (J_x - a, J_y). Coordinates of M are (a, 0). So vector KM is (a - (J_x - a), 0 - J_y) = (2a - J_x, -J_y). Length of KM is √[(2a - J_x)^2 + J_y²]. 

But in a parallelogram, the sum of squares of diagonals is 2*(sum of squares of sides). Let me denote the sides as LK and KJ. 

Side LK: length is √[(J_x - a)^2 + J_y^2]  
Side KJ: length is a (as shown earlier)  

So diagonal1² + diagonal2² = 2*(LK² + KJ²)  
Where diagonal1 is LJ = 2x + 1, diagonal2 is KM = √[(2a - J_x)^2 + J_y²]  

So: (2x + 1)^2 + [(2a - J_x)^2 + J_y²] = 2*[( (J_x - a)^2 + J_y^2 ) + a²]  

Expand left side: 4x² +4x +1 + (4a² -4aJ_x + J_x² + J_y²)  
Right side: 2*(J_x² - 2aJ_x + a² + J_y² + a²) = 2*(J_x² - 2aJ_x + 2a² + J_y²) = 2J_x² -4aJ_x + 4a² + 2J_y²  

Left side: 4x² +4x +1 +4a² -4aJ_x + J_x² + J_y²  
Right side: 2J_x² -4aJ_x + 4a² + 2J_y²  

Set equal: 4x² +4x +1 +4a² -4aJ_x + J_x² + J_y² = 2J_x² -4aJ_x + 4a² + 2J_y²  

Cancel terms: 4a² -4aJ_x appears on both sides, so cancel. 

Remaining: 4x² +4x +1 + J_x² + J_y² = 2J_x² + 2J_y²  
Rearrange: 4x² +4x +1 = J_x² + J_y²  

But from equation 1, J_x² + J_y² = 4x² +4x +1. So this is an identity, providing no new information. 

This means our previous equations are consistent but don't give new info. 

At this point, it seems we're stuck without additional constraints. Maybe there's a property I'm missing, or perhaps the problem assumes that J lies on a specific line, like the diagonal LN or something. 

Wait, the diagonal LN is from L(0,0) to N(a,b). If J lies on this diagonal, then its coordinates would be a parameter along LN. Let me assume that J is on LN. 

Parametrize LN: any point on LN can be written as t*a, t*b, where t ∈ [0,1]. So J_x = ta, J_y = tb. 

Then LJ is the distance from L to J: √[(ta)^2 + (tb)^2] = t√(a² + b²) = t*10, since a² + b² = 100. 

Given that LJ = 2x + 1, so t*10 = 2x + 1 → t = (2x + 1)/10. 

Also, PJ is the distance from P(0,b) to J(ta, tb): √[(ta - 0)^2 + (tb - b)^2] = √[t²a² + (b(t - 1))^2] = √[t²a² + b²(t - 1)^2]. 

Given that PJ = 3x - 1, so:

√[t²a² + b²(t - 1)^2] = 3x - 1. Squaring both sides:

t²a² + b²(t - 1)^2 = (3x - 1)^2. 

But we also know that a²
