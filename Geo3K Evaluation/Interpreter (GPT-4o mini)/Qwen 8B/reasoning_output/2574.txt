Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, the question is about finding the measure of arc GLJ, given some points and angles. Let me start by going through the given predicates carefully.

First, the problem mentions a circle K, so I know that K is the center of the circle. Points G, J, H are mentioned as points on the circle since they're listed with PointLiesOnCircle. Also, there's a line GJ and another line JH. Then there are two angles at point K: Angle(G,K,J) and Angle(H,K,J). The measure of Angle(G,K,J) is given as 122 degrees. 

Wait, the question asks for the measure of arc GLJ. Hmm, but wait, the original problem mentions points G, J, H, K. Wait, where does point L come into play? Oh, maybe there's a typo here? Because the problem says "Find m∠GLJ" but the given points don't mention L. Wait, looking back at the problem statement again. Wait, the user wrote "Find m ∠GLJ." But in the given predicates, there's no mention of point L. That seems confusing. Maybe it's a mistake? Or perhaps L refers to point K? Because K is the center. Wait, maybe there's a typo and the intended point was K instead of L? Let me check again.

Looking at the initial setup: the points given are G, J, H, K. Wait, the problem says "Point(K)" twice? Wait, the first line says "Point(G), Point(J), Point(H), Point(K)". So K is a point, which is also the center of the circle. Then the lines are Line(G,J), Line(J,H), and the angles at K. Then there's PointLiesOnLine(K, Line(G,J)) and PointLiesOnLine(K, Line(J,H)). So K lies on both lines GJ and JH. Wait, but if K is the center of the circle, and G, J, H are on the circle, then lines GJ and JH would pass through the center K. So that implies that GK and JK are radii? Wait, because K is the center, so KG and KJ are radii. But if K is on line GJ, then that means that line GJ passes through the center K. Therefore, GJ is a diameter? Because if a line passes through the center and connects two points on the circle, those two points are endpoints of a diameter. Wait, but the question says "G J is a diameter of ⊙K". So yes, GJ is a diameter. So that makes sense.

Now, the question is to find the measure of arc GLJ. But there's no point L mentioned in the given predicates. Wait, maybe there's a typo and it should be arc GKH or something else? Alternatively, maybe L is a typo for K? Let me think. If the original problem had a typo, and it's supposed to be arc GJK, then that would make sense. Alternatively, maybe L is another point on the circle? But the given predicates don't mention L. This is confusing. Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to a different point? Let me recheck the original problem.

Original question: "Find m ∠GLJ." So the angle is GLJ. So the vertex is L, with segments GL and JL. But there's no information about point L in the given predicates. Unless there's a missing point? Wait, the user might have made a typo. Alternatively, perhaps L is meant to be K? For example, maybe the angle is GKL or something. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the measure of arc GJ, but that's already a diameter. Wait, but the answer choices include 90, 120, 180, 360. Since GJ is a diameter, the arc GJ would be 180 degrees. But that's one of the options. However, the question specifically says arc GLJ, which suggests three points. Wait, unless it's a typo and it's supposed to be arc GHJ or something else. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the measure of angle GLJ, which could be an inscribed angle. But without knowing where L is, it's impossible to tell.

Wait, maybe there's confusion between angle and arc. Let me re-examine the problem. The given angle measures are at point K. The angle at K between G and J is 122 degrees. Then there's another angle at K between H and J. Wait, the problem states:

Angle(G,K,J) and Angle(H,K,J) are given. So, these are angles at point K, with sides KG-KJ and KH-KJ respectively. Wait, so the measure of angle GKH is 122 degrees? Wait, no. Let me parse that. The angle G,K,J means the angle at point K between points G and J. Similarly, angle H,K,J is the angle at K between H and J. So, if we consider point K as the vertex, then the angle between KG and KJ is 122 degrees. And the angle between KH and KJ is... Well, since points G, J, H are all on the circle, and K is the center, then lines KG, KJ, KH are radii. Therefore, each of these angles at K are central angles corresponding to arcs between the respective points.

So, for example, angle G,K,J is the central angle between points G and J, which corresponds to arc GJ. Similarly, angle H,K,J is the central angle between points H and J, corresponding to arc HJ.

But since GJ is a diameter, the arc GJ would be 180 degrees. But the given measure of angle G,K,J is 122 degrees. Wait, that contradicts. Wait, if GJ is a diameter, then the central angle between G and J should be 180 degrees. But according to the given, angle G,K,J is 122 degrees. That doesn't align. There's a contradiction here. Therefore, my earlier assumption that GJ is a diameter must be wrong?

Wait, the problem says "G J is a diameter of ⊙K". So the user explicitly states that GJ is a diameter. But according to the given angle measure, angle at K between G and J is 122 degrees. Which would imply that the central angle is 122 degrees, hence the arc GJ would be 122 degrees. But if GJ is a diameter, the arc should be 180 degrees. So there's inconsistency here. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe the problem isn't stating that GJ is a diameter, but rather that GJ is a diameter? Wait, the user wrote: "G J is a diameter of ⊙K". So that's part of the problem statement. But according to the given predicates, there's a point K, which is the center. So if GJ is a diameter, then K should lie on GJ. Which is confirmed by the predicate "PointLiesOnLine(K, Line(G,J))".

Therefore, K is the midpoint of GJ. Hence, the length of GK equals KJ. But the angle at K between G and J is given as 122 degrees. Wait, but if GJ is a straight line passing through K, then the angle between KG and KJ would be 180 degrees, not 122. So this is conflicting. Therefore, there's a contradiction in the given data. How can GJ be a diameter (so that the central angle between G and J is 180°), yet the angle at K between them is 122°? That's impossible. Therefore, there must be a misinterpretation.

Wait, perhaps the angle is not between G and J directly, but maybe involving other points? Let me look again. The given angle is Angle(G,K,J), which is the angle at K between points G and J. So, if K is on the line GJ, then that angle would be a straight angle (180°). But the given measure is 122°, which is less than 180. Therefore, this suggests that K is not on the line GJ. But the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(K, Line(G,J)), so K is on line GJ. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. This indicates that either there's a mistake in the problem, or I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Alternatively, maybe the points G, J, and H are arranged such that K is not colinear with G and J? But the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(K, Line(G,J)), so K is on line GJ. Therefore, the angle at K between G and J would be a straight angle. Therefore, the given measure of 122° cannot be correct. Therefore, there's an error in the problem setup. But since the problem is presented as solvable, perhaps there's a different interpretation.

Wait, maybe the angle is not between G and J, but between other points? No, the angle is specified as Angle(G,K,J), which is the angle at K formed by points G, K, J. So that's the angle between KG and KJ. But if K is on line GJ, then the angle between KG and KJ would be 180°, making the measure 180°, not 122°. Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding in how the points are positioned.

Wait, perhaps the line GJ is not passing through K? But the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(K, Line(G,J)), so K is on line GJ. Therefore, the angle at K between G and J is a straight angle. Therefore, the given measure of 122° is conflicting. Therefore, the problem has inconsistent information. But since this is a problem to solve, perhaps I need to proceed despite the contradiction. Alternatively, maybe there's a different configuration.

Let me try to visualize. Suppose K is the center of the circle, and G, J, H are points on the circle. Lines GJ and JH are drawn, and K is on both lines. Therefore, K is the intersection point of lines GJ and JH. But if K is the center, then lines GJ and JH must pass through the center. Therefore, GJ is a diameter, and JH is another chord passing through the center. Therefore, H is another point on the circle such that line JH passes through the center K. So, JH is a diameter as well? Because if line JH passes through the center, then JH is a diameter. Therefore, H is diametrically opposite to J. Wait, but then angle at K between H and J would be 180°, but there's another angle given: Angle(H,K,J) is also present. But the problem doesn't specify its measure.

Wait, but the problem gives MeasureOf(Angle(G,K,J)) = 122°, which conflicts with the idea that K is on line GJ. Unless the angle is not between G and J, but involving other points. Wait, perhaps there's a misread in the angle notation. In standard notation, Angle(G,K,J) is the angle at point K between points G and J. So that's the angle between lines KG and KJ. But if K is on line GJ, then that angle is 180°, not 122°. So this is contradictory. Therefore, the only way this makes sense is if K is not on line GJ. But the predicate says it is. So this is a paradox.

Perhaps the problem is mistyped, and the angle is not at K but somewhere else? Or maybe the angle is not between G and J but involves other points? Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses non-standard notation. Let me try to assume that there's a mistake and that the angle is at point J instead. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the given angle is not a central angle but an inscribed angle. Wait, but the angle is at point K, which is the center. Central angles are measured at the center, so that's consistent. But again, the conflict remains.

Given this contradiction, perhaps the problem assumes that K is not on line GJ, even though the predicate says it is. That would mean the given data is incorrect, but proceeding under the assumption that the angle at K between G and J is 122°, even though it should be 180°, leading us to proceed.

Assuming that despite the contradiction, the angle at K between G and J is 122°, then the arc GJ would correspond to this central angle, so the measure of arc GJ is 122°. Now, the question asks for the measure of arc GLJ. Assuming that L is a typo and should be K, then arc GKL would be... Wait, but K is the center, not on the circumference. Arcs are parts of the circumference, so they can't involve the center. Therefore, this is confusing.

Alternatively, if L is another point on the circle, but it's not mentioned in the given predicates. Without knowing where L is, we can't compute the arc measure. Therefore, this suggests that there's a typo or missing information in the problem. Given that, but since the answer choices are given, perhaps the intended question was to find the measure of arc GHJ or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to angle GLJ being an inscribed angle. If L is a point on the circle, and assuming that the angle is formed by points G, L, J. If we can find the measure of that angle, which would relate to the arc it subtends. But without knowing where L is, it's hard to say. However, considering the given angles at K, perhaps there's a relationship between the angles at K and the inscribed angles.

Alternatively, since angle at K between G and J is 122°, which would be the central angle for arc GJ, so arc GJ is 122°. Then, if we consider point H on the circle, with line JH passing through K, implying that H is diametrically opposite to J. Therefore, arc JH would be 180°, since it's a diameter. Then, maybe the arc from G to H via J would be arc GJ + arc JH? But arc GJ is 122°, arc JH is 180°, so total arc GH would be 122+180=302°, which doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, if we consider the angle at K between H and J is some measure. Let me see. Since K is on line JH, then line JH passes through K, so H is on the circle, and line JH passes through K. So, since K is the center, JH is a diameter, so H is diametrically opposite to J. Therefore, the arc from J to H is 180°, and the arc from G to J is 122°, so the arc from G to H would be 122° + 180° = 302°, but that's more than 360°, which is impossible. So that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the arc GLJ refers to the arc from G to J passing through L, but without knowing where L is, it's unclear. Perhaps the problem had a typo, and L is actually K? If so, then the arc from G to K to J would be... but K is the center, not on the circle. So that doesn't make sense.

This is very confusing. Given the ambiguity, but trying to proceed with the given information, perhaps the intended question is to find the measure of angle GLJ, which is an inscribed angle. If we assume that L is a point on the circle such that KL is a radius, but without knowing where, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the angle at L is formed by points G, L, J, where L is another point on the circle. For instance, if L is the intersection of certain lines.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the measure of angle GHL or something else. But without more info, it's challenging. Given the time I've spent and the lack of clarity, perhaps I should make assumptions based on the given angle measures.

Since angle at K between G and J is 122°, which is a central angle, so arc GJ is 122°. If the question is asking for the measure of arc GJ, then the answer would be 122°, but that's not among the answer choices except for option B (120) or C (180). But since 122 is not an option, this suggests that the actual question is different.

Wait, the original question says "Find m ∠GLJ." Assuming that it's an inscribed angle. If angle GLJ is an inscribed angle subtended by arc GJ, then its measure would be half of the central angle. But the central angle is 122°, so the inscribed angle would be 61°, which is not an option. Alternatively, if the angle is subtended by another arc.

Alternatively, if there's another angle involved. For example, if angle GLJ is formed by points G, L, J, where L is on the circle. Suppose L is the point H. Then angle GLJ would be the angle at L between G and J. But without knowing where L is, it's hard to tell. If L is H, then angle GLH would be an inscribed angle. But given that H is on the circle, and line JH passes through K (the center), then H is diametrically opposite to J. So, arc from J to H is 180°, so the inscribed angle over that arc would be 90°, but again, not sure.

Alternatively, since angle at K between G and J is 122°, and angle at K between H and J is... Well, if JH is a diameter, then the angle at K between H and J is 180°, but that's not given. However, maybe there's another relationship. If we consider triangle GKH, where K is the center, and G, H are on the circle. The angle at K between G and H would be the sum of angles between G and J plus between J and H. But since JH is a diameter, the angle between J and H at K is 180°, so total angle at K between G and H would be 122° + 180° = 302°, which is more than 180°, which is not possible for a central angle. Therefore, this is invalid.

Given all this confusion, perhaps the correct answer is B (120), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the given angle is 122°, and if there's an inscribed angle subtending the same arc, it would be half, but that's 61°, not an option. Alternatively, if there's a supplementary angle. If the central angle is 122°, then the arc is 122°, and the remaining arc is 360 - 122 = 238°, but that doesn't help.

Alternatively, if the question is asking for the measure of the arc that is opposite to the given angle. But I'm stuck.

Wait, the answer choices are A. 90, B. 120, C. 180, D. 360. If the arc is 122°, none of these match. But if there's a calculation error, like the central angle is 122°, and the inscribed angle is 61°, but that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe the angle at K is not the central angle, but somehow related to other arcs.

Wait, maybe the given angle is not the central angle. If K is not the center, but the problem says it is. This is getting too convoluted. Given that, perhaps the correct answer is B (120), as a common angle, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, since the angle at K is 122°, and if there's an inscribed angle subtending the same arc, it would be half, but since that's not an option, maybe the answer is 180°, which is option C. But why?

Alternatively, since GJ is a diameter, then any angle subtended by GJ would be a right angle, but that applies to inscribed angles. If the angle at L is on the circle, then angle GLJ would be 90°, which is option A. But how do we know L is on the circle? It's not stated.

Given the confusion and the need to choose from the options, and considering that GJ is a diameter, and if the question is asking for an inscribed angle subtended by GJ, then it would be 90°, making option A. But the given angle at K is 122°, which conflicts with that. But perhaps the correct answer is A, 90°, assuming that the angle at L is inscribed.

However, without knowing the position of L, it's uncertain. But given the options, and the presence of 90°, which is a common right angle, I'll go with A.
