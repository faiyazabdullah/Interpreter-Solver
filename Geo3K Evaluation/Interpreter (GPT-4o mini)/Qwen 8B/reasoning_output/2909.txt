MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, first, I need to parse all the given predicates and see how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have several triangles mentioned: Triangle(W,X,Y), Triangle(X,Y,Z), and Triangle(W,X,Z). That means points W, X, Y, Z form these triangles. Also, there are some angle measures given. Specifically, Angle(W,X,Z) is 105 degrees, Angle(X,W,Z) is 23 degrees, and Angle(X,Z,W) is 24 degrees. Then there are three right angles: Angle(Y,X,Z), Angle(X,Y,W), and Angle(Z,Y,W). The question is asking for m∠1, but since ∠1 isn't labeled yet, maybe it refers to one of these angles? Wait, perhaps ∠1 is referring to one of the angles we need to find based on the given info?

Wait, maybe I should draw a diagram mentally. Let me note down the triangles. 

First, Triangle(W,X,Y): so points W, X, Y form a triangle. Then Triangle(X,Y,Z): X, Y, Z. And Triangle(W,X,Z): W, X, Z. So points W, X, Z are connected through different triangles. Also, there are three right angles: at Y,X,Z; X,Y,W; and Z,Y,W. Hmm. Let me think about the right angles. 

RightAngle(Angle(Y,X,Z)) means that angle at point X between Y and Z is a right angle. Similarly, RightAngle(Angle(X,Y,W)) implies that angle at Y between X and W is a right angle. And RightAngle(Angle(Z,Y,W)) means angle at Y between Z and W is a right angle? Wait, no. Wait, Angle(Z,Y,W) would be the angle at Y between Z and W. So those three right angles are at different points. Let me clarify:

- RightAngle(Angle(Y,X,Z)): This is the angle at X between Y and Z. So angle YXZ is 90 degrees.
- RightAngle(Angle(X,Y,W)): This is the angle at Y between X and W. So angle XYW is 90 degrees.
- RightAngle(Angle(Z,Y,W)): This is the angle at Y between Z and W. So angle ZYW is 90 degrees. Wait, but if both angle XYW and ZYW are right angles at Y, does that mean that points X, Y, Z, W are arranged such that Y has two right angles? But that seems impossible unless... Maybe there's something wrong here. Because if angle at Y between X and W is 90°, and angle at Y between Z and W is also 90°, then points X and Z would be aligned with respect to Y? Or perhaps Y is part of multiple right angles. 

Alternatively, maybe these right angles are parts of different triangles. For example, in triangle XYZ, angle at X is right angle (from Angle(Y,X,Z)). In triangle XYW, angle at Y is right angle (from Angle(X,Y,W)). In triangle ZYW, angle at Y is right angle (from Angle(Z,Y,W))? Wait, but angle ZYW would be part of triangle ZYW, which may not necessarily be a right triangle. Wait, the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(Z,Y,W)), so angle at Y between Z and W is 90°, making triangle ZYW a right triangle at Y. 

But then, considering that there are multiple right angles at different points. Let me try to sketch this mentally. Points W, X, Y, Z. 

Starting with triangle WXY: right angle at X (since Angle(Y,X,Z) is right, but wait, that's angle YXZ. Wait, angle YXZ is part of triangle YXZ. Wait, the first triangle is Triangle(W,X,Y), so that's triangle with vertices W, X, Y. Then another triangle is Triangle(X,Y,Z), so X, Y, Z. Another triangle is Triangle(W,X,Z), so W, X, Z. 

So, the three triangles share edges. Let me consider the angles given. 

First, measure of Angle(W,X,Z) is 105°. So that's angle at X between W and Z. Wait, because the middle letter is X, so vertex at X, sides going to W and Z. So angle WXZ is 105°. 

Then, MeasureOf(Angle(X,W,Z)) is 23°, so angle at W between X and Z. So angle XWZ is 23°. 

MeasureOf(Angle(X,Z,W)) is 24°, so angle at Z between X and W. So angle XZW is 24°. 

So looking at triangle WXZ. Let me check the sum of angles. In triangle WXZ, angles at W, X, Z. Given that angle at X is 105°, angle at W is 23°, angle at Z is 24°. Summing them up: 105 + 23 + 24 = 152°, which is way less than 180°, which is impossible. Wait, that can't be right. There must be an error here. Wait, hold on. Wait, angle measures in a triangle must add up to 180°, so if those three angles sum to 152°, that suggests inconsistency. Therefore, I must have misinterpreted the angles. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying which angle corresponds to which. Let me re-examine the angle notations. 

In the given, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(W,X,Z)), 105). The notation Angle(W,X,Z) represents the angle at point X between points W and Z. So yes, angle at X, formed by segments XW and XZ. So that is angle W-X-Z, which is indeed angle at X. 

Then Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(X,W,Z)), 23). So Angle(X,W,Z) is the angle at point W between X and Z. So that's angle at W, formed by segments WX and WZ. So that's angle X-W-Z, which is angle at W. 

Similarly, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(X,Z,W)), 24). So Angle(X,Z,W) is angle at Z between X and W. So angle at Z, formed by segments ZX and ZW. So angle X-Z-W, which is angle at Z. 

Therefore, in triangle WXZ, angles are: at X: 105°, at W: 23°, at Z: 24°, totaling 152°, which is impossible. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Which suggests that my understanding is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the given angles are not all within triangle WXZ. Wait, but if those angles are parts of different triangles? 

Wait, but triangle WXZ exists, so its internal angles should add to 180°. However, according to the given measures, they don't. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding. Perhaps the angles are not all internal angles of triangle WXZ. Wait, but Angle(W,X,Z) is definitely an internal angle of triangle WXZ. Same with Angle(X,W,Z) and Angle(X,Z,W). Therefore, adding up to 152°, which contradicts triangle angle sum. Hence, something is wrong. 

Wait, maybe the given angles are not all angles of triangle WXZ? Let me check again. 

Let me list all the angles given:

- Angle(W,X,Z) = 105° → angle at X between W and Z (internal angle of triangle WXZ)
- Angle(X,W,Z) = 23° → angle at W between X and Z (internal angle of triangle WXZ)
- Angle(X,Z,W) = 24° → angle at Z between X and W (internal angle of triangle WXZ)

Thus, they are all internal angles of triangle WXZ, which would make their sum 105+23+24=152, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be an error in interpreting the angle notations. 

Wait, perhaps the notation is different. Sometimes, angle ABC is the angle at B, but sometimes people use different notations. Wait, but the standard notation is that Angle(A,B,C) is the angle at B between points A and C. So that should be correct. Unless the problem uses a different convention. 

Alternatively, could there be overlapping triangles where these angles are not all in the same triangle? Wait, but the triangle WXZ is explicitly stated as existing, so those angles must belong to it. 

This suggests that either there's a typo in the problem, or I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps some of the given angles are exterior angles? Or maybe some of the given angles are not internal angles. Wait, but the problem states "MeasureOf(Angle(...))", so they are angles as per the notation. 

Hmm, this seems contradictory. Let me check again. Suppose that in triangle WXZ, the angles are at W, X, Z. So:

At X: 105°, at W: 23°, at Z: 24°. Sum is 152. Not possible. Therefore, this indicates that there's an error in the problem statement, or perhaps I misread the angles. Let me check the original problem again.

Original problem's given:

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(W,X,Z)), 105)
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(X,W,Z)), 23)
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(X,Z,W)), 24)

Ah! Wait, Angle(X,Z,W) is written as Angle(X,Z,W), which would be angle at Z between X and W. But in the previous case, if we're talking about triangle WXZ, the angles are:

At W: angle between X and Z → Angle(X,W,Z) = 23°
At X: angle between W and Z → Angle(W,X,Z) = 105°
At Z: angle between W and X → Angle(W,Z,X)? Wait, no. Wait, angle at Z between W and X would be Angle(W,Z,X), which is different from Angle(X,Z,W). Wait, Angle(X,Z,W) is the angle at Z between X and W, which is the same as angle at Z between W and X. So that's the third angle. 

Wait, so in triangle WXZ, the three angles are:

At W: 23°
At X: 105°
At Z: ?

Wait, but the third angle is supposed to be Angle(X,Z,W), which is at Z. So if the sum is 23 + 105 + ? = 180 → ? = 52°. But according to the given, it's 24°. So that's inconsistent. Therefore, there's a contradiction. 

But the problem gives that Angle(X,Z,W) is 24°, so that would imply that the third angle at Z is 24°, leading to total 23 + 105 + 24 = 152, which is invalid. Therefore, this suggests that there's an error in the problem setup. However, since this is a problem given to solve, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. 

Wait, maybe the angles given are not all in the same triangle? Let me check. For instance, Angle(W,X,Z) is part of triangle WXZ. Angle(X,W,Z) is also part of triangle WXZ. Angle(X,Z,W) is also part of triangle WXZ. So all three angles are in triangle WXZ. Thus, their sum must be 180°, but according to the given measures, they sum to 152°, which is impossible. 

This suggests that there's an error in the problem, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the angles. Let me double-check the notation once more. 

Another possibility: perhaps Angle(X,Z,W) refers to an external angle? Or maybe it's a different triangle. Wait, but the triangle WXZ is given as existing. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle measures are not all in the same triangle. For example, Angle(W,X,Z) is in triangle WXZ, Angle(X,W,Z) is in triangle WXZ, and Angle(X,Z,W) is in another triangle. But how? 

Wait, Angle(X,Z,W) is the angle at Z between X and W. So that's part of triangle XZW (same as triangle WXZ). So all three angles are in the same triangle. 

This leads me to believe that there's a mistake in the problem, but since I have to work with it, perhaps I need to proceed differently. Maybe the angles given are not all internal angles of triangle WXZ. Maybe some are external? For example, if Angle(X,W,Z) is an external angle? But that's unclear without seeing the diagram. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angles given are parts of different triangles. Let me consider the other triangles. 

Triangle(W,X,Y): which includes points W, X, Y. Since there's a right angle at Angle(Y,X,Z), which is angle at X between Y and Z. Wait, that's part of triangle YXZ, not WXZ. Wait, but if Y is involved, then maybe triangle YXZ is separate. 

Wait, let's try to reconstruct the entire figure. 

We have four points: W, X, Y, Z. 

Triangles:

- W, X, Y: Triangle(W,X,Y)
- X, Y, Z: Triangle(X,Y,Z)
- W, X, Z: Triangle(W,X,Z)

Also, right angles:

- At angle Y,X,Z (which is angle at X between Y and Z): RightAngle(Angle(Y,X,Z))
- At angle X,Y,W (angle at Y between X and W): RightAngle(Angle(X,Y,W))
- At angle Z,Y,W (angle at Y between Z and W): RightAngle(Angle(Z,Y,W))

So, angle at X between Y and Z is right. So, in triangle YXZ, angle at X is 90°. 

Angle at Y between X and W is right. So, in triangle XYW, angle at Y is 90°. 

Angle at Y between Z and W is right. So, in triangle ZYW, angle at Y is 90°. 

Wait, so point Y has two right angles? One between X and Z, and another between Z and W? No, that can't be. Because if both Angle(X,Y,W) and Angle(Z,Y,W) are right angles, then at point Y, there are two right angles, implying that lines YX and YZ are perpendicular to YW. But that would mean that lines YX and YZ are both perpendicular to YW, which would make YX and YZ parallel to each other. 

But let's try to imagine this. 

Point Y has two right angles: one between X and W, and another between Z and W. So, if we consider point Y, and line YW, then both YX and YZ are perpendicular to YW. That would mean that YX and YZ are both perpendicular to YW, hence they are parallel to each other. 

So, YX || YZ. But since YX and YZ meet at Y, they can't be parallel unless they are the same line, which is not possible. Therefore, this suggests that there's a contradiction unless YX and YZ are the same line, which they aren't. Therefore, this scenario is impossible. 

This indicates that there's an inconsistency in the given premises. However, since this is a problem presented to solve, I must assume that there's no error and that I've misunderstood the configuration. 

Perhaps the right angles are not at the same point? Wait, no. The first right angle is at X between Y and Z: Angle(Y,X,Z) is right. Second is at Y between X and W: Angle(X,Y,W) is right. Third is at Y between Z and W: Angle(Z,Y,W) is right. So, the first right angle is at X, while the others are at Y. 

Wait, earlier I thought that Angle(Y,X,Z) is at X, but maybe I got that wrong. Let me clarify angle notation again. 

The notation Angle(A,B,C) means the angle at point B between points A and C. So:

- Angle(Y,X,Z) is the angle at X between Y and Z. So that's angle Y-X-Z, which is at X.
- Angle(X,Y,W) is the angle at Y between X and W. So that's angle X-Y-W, at Y.
- Angle(Z,Y,W) is the angle at Y between Z and W. So that's angle Z-Y-W, at Y.

So, the first right angle is at X, the other two are at Y. 

So, at point Y, there are two right angles: one between X and W, and one between Z and W. This would mean that at point Y, lines YX and YZ are both perpendicular to YW. So, YX ⊥ YW and YZ ⊥ YW. Hence, YX and YZ are parallel. 

Now, let's consider triangle WXY: it has a right angle at Y (from Angle(X,Y,W)). Wait, no. Angle(X,Y,W) is at Y between X and W, which would be part of triangle XYW. So triangle XYW has a right angle at Y. Similarly, triangle ZYW has a right angle at Y. 

Now, considering triangle WXY: right-angled at Y. So, sides XY and YW are perpendicular. Similarly, triangle ZYW is right-angled at Y, so sides YZ and YW are perpendicular. Hence, XY ⊥ YW and YZ ⊥ YW, so XY || YZ. 

So, lines XY and YZ are both perpendicular to YW, hence they are parallel. 

Now, returning to triangle WXZ, which has angles at X: 105°, at W: 23°, and at Z: 24°, which sums to 152°, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be an error. 

Wait, but maybe the angles given are not all in triangle WXZ. Let me check again. 

Angle(W,X,Z) = 105°: this is angle at X between W and Z. So, in triangle WXZ, this is the angle at X. 

Angle(X,W,Z) = 23°: angle at W between X and Z. So, in triangle WXZ, this is the angle at W. 

Angle(X,Z,W) = 24°: angle at Z between X and W. So, in triangle WXZ, this is the angle at Z. 

So, they are all angles of triangle WXZ, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that there's an error in the problem, or I'm missing something. 

Alternatively, perhaps some of these angles are not part of triangle WXZ. Wait, but the notation implies they are. 

Wait, maybe the angle measures are not all in the same triangle. Let me think. 

Suppose that Angle(W,X,Z) = 105° is part of triangle WXZ. Angle(X,W,Z) = 23° is part of another triangle, say, triangle XWZ? No, that's the same triangle. 

Alternatively, maybe Angle(X,Z,W) refers to an angle outside of triangle WXZ. For example, if there's a different triangle involving X, Z, W. But since triangle WXZ exists, that angle must be part of it. 

This is perplexing. Perhaps the problem involves multiple triangles with shared sides, and some angles are external? 

Alternatively, maybe the given angles are not all in the same triangle. Let me consider the other triangles. 

For example, triangle WXY is right-angled at Y. So, in that triangle, the angles are 90° at Y, and the other two angles at W and X. Similarly, triangle XYZ has a right angle at X. 

Maybe I should focus on the right angles first. 

Since there are right angles at X (in triangle YXZ) and at Y (in triangles XYW and ZYW), maybe I can find relations between the triangles. 

Let me attempt to reconstruct coordinates. Assign coordinates to points to satisfy the given conditions. 

Let me place point Y at origin (0,0). Since there are right angles at Y between X and W, and between Z and W, let's assume YW is along the x-axis, and YX and YZ are along y-axis. 

But since there are two right angles at Y: between X and W, and between Z and W. So, if Y is at (0,0), and YW is along x-axis, then point W is somewhere on x-axis, say at (a,0). Point X is perpendicular to YW, so along y-axis, say at (0,b). Similarly, point Z is also perpendicular to YW, so also along y-axis, but in the same direction as X? Or opposite? 

Wait, if YW is along x-axis from Y(0,0) to W(a,0), then the right angle at Y between X and W implies that YX is vertical. So, point X is at (0,b). Similarly, the right angle at Y between Z and W implies that YZ is also vertical. But if both YX and YZ are vertical, then points X and Z are along the same line (y-axis). So, X could be at (0,b) and Z at (0,c), with b ≠ c. 

But then, in triangle YXZ, which is right-angled at X. Wait, Angle(Y,X,Z) is a right angle, which is at X. So, in triangle YXZ, angle at X is right. 

So, triangle YXZ has right angle at X. Let's verify. 

Points:

Y(0,0), X(0,b), Z(0,c). Then, segment YX is vertical, XZ is horizontal from X(0,b) to Z(0,c)? No, wait, Z is at (0,c), so XZ would be from (0,b) to (0,c), which is vertical. So triangle YXZ would have points Y(0,0), X(0,b), Z(0,c). All on y-axis, forming a degenerate triangle. That's impossible. 

Therefore, this suggests that my assumption is wrong. 

Alternatively, perhaps Z is not on the same line as X. Let me think again. 

If YW is along x-axis, and YX and YZ are both perpendicular to YW, then they are both vertical. So, points X and Z must lie along the same line (the y-axis). But then, in triangle YXZ, with X and Z on y-axis and Y at (0,0), the triangle would be degenerate if X and Z are on the same line. Hence, this is not possible. Therefore, my assumption that both YX and YZ are along the same line is incorrect. 

Wait, but if YX and YZ are both perpendicular to YW, which is along x-axis, then both YX and YZ must be vertical lines. Hence, points X and Z are on the same vertical line (y-axis). Hence, points X and Z are colinear with Y on the same vertical line. So, triangle YXZ would collapse into a straight line, which is invalid. 

This suggests that there's an inconsistency in the given right angles. 

Alternatively, perhaps one of the right angles is not at Y. Wait, no. According to the given predicates, RightAngle(Angle(Y,X,Z)) is at X, RightAngle(Angle(X,Y,W)) at Y, and RightAngle(Angle(Z,Y,W)) at Y. 

So, there is a right angle at X (between Y and Z), and two right angles at Y. 

Let me try to assign coordinates differently. Let's suppose that the right angle at X is between Y and Z. So, at point X, Y and Z are perpendicular. 

Let me set point X at (0,0). Let me assume that the right angle at X is between Y and Z. So, if X is at (0,0), then Y and Z are along axes. Let's say Y is along positive x-axis and Z along positive y-axis. So, Y is (a,0), Z is (0,b). 

Now, the other right angles: Angle(X,Y,W) is at Y between X and W. So, at point Y(a,0), between X(0,0) and W. This implies that the segment YW is perpendicular to segment YX. Since YX is from Y(a,0) to X(0,0), which is along negative x-axis. So, for YW to be perpendicular to YX, it must be along positive y-axis. Hence, point W is somewhere along the line extending from Y(a,0) upwards along y-axis. So, W would be at (a, c), for some c. 

Similarly, Angle(Z,Y,W) is at Y between Z and W. So, at point Y(a,0), between Z and W. Z is at (0,b), and W is at (a,c). So, the segment YZ goes from Y(a,0) to Z(0,b), and segment YW goes from Y(a,0) to W(a,c). These two segments at Y should form a right angle. 

Wait, vector from Y to Z is (-a, b), and vector from Y to W is (0, c). Their dot product is (-a)(0) + (b)(c) = bc. For them to be perpendicular, this dot product must be zero. Hence, bc = 0. So either b=0 or c=0. But b is the y-coordinate of Z, which cannot be zero since Z is distinct from Y. Similarly, c cannot be zero since W is distinct from Y. Hence, this is impossible. 

This suggests that with this coordinate assignment, the condition of having Angle(Z,Y,W) as a right angle is violated. Therefore, there's a contradiction. 

This indicates that the given predicates are conflicting, making it impossible to construct such a figure. But since this is a problem given to solve, perhaps there's a different interpretation. 

Let me try to think differently. Maybe the right angles are not at the same points. Wait, the given right angles are:

- Angle(Y,X,Z) is right: at X between Y and Z.
- Angle(X,Y,W) is right: at Y between X and W.
- Angle(Z,Y,W) is right: at Y between Z and W.

So, at point Y, there are two right angles: one between X and W, and one between Z and W. As before, this requires that vectors YX and YZ are both perpendicular to YW, making YX and YZ parallel. 

But if YX and YZ are parallel, then in triangle YXZ, which has a right angle at X, and YX is parallel to YZ, this would require certain conditions. 

Let me try assigning coordinates again, assuming YX and YZ are parallel. 

Let me set Y at (0,0). Let me assume that YW is along x-axis, so W is at (w,0). 

Since YX and YZ are both perpendicular to YW, they are vertical. So, YX is vertical, so X is at (0,x), and YZ is vertical, so Z is at (0,z). 

Now, triangle YXZ has points Y(0,0), X(0,x), Z(0,z). This forms a degenerate triangle if x and z are on the same line (y-axis), making it a straight line. Hence, not a valid triangle. 

Unless x and z are on opposite sides of Y. For example, X at (0,a) and Z at (0,-b), making YX and YZ in opposite directions. Then, triangle YXZ would have points Y(0,0), X(0,a), Z(0,-b), forming a degenerate triangle if they are collinear. Still, it's a straight line. 

Hence, this suggests that the given conditions are impossible. 

Given this contradiction, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I'm missing a key insight. 

Alternatively, maybe the angles given are not all in the same triangle. Let me revisit the angles. 

The given angles are:

- Angle(W,X,Z) = 105°: at X, between W and Z.
- Angle(X,W,Z) = 23°: at W, between X and Z.
- Angle(X,Z,W) = 24°: at Z, between X and W. 

These are the three angles of triangle WXZ, which must sum to 180°, but they sum to 105 + 23 + 24 = 152°, which is impossible. 

But the problem states these as given, so perhaps there's a different interpretation. Maybe these are not all internal angles of triangle WXZ? 

Wait, if Angle(W,X,Z) is 105°, which is at X, between W and Z. Angle(X,W,Z) is at W, between X and Z. Angle(X,Z,W) is at Z, between X and W. These are the three angles of triangle WXZ. Hence, their sum must be 180°. 

But they don't. Hence, this suggests that there's an error in the problem, or perhaps the angles are not all in the same triangle. 

Alternatively, perhaps one of the angles is an external angle? For example, Angle(X,Z,W) could be an external angle to triangle WXZ. But in that case, it would be equal to the sum of the other two angles. 

Wait, if Angle(X,Z,W) is an external angle at Z, then it would be equal to the sum of the remote interior angles. But in that case, if Angle(X,Z,W) = 24°, then it should equal the sum of angles at W and X. But angle at W is 23°, angle at X is 105°, sum is 128°, which doesn't equal 24°. So that doesn't fit. 

Alternatively, maybe one of the angles is a reflex angle? But reflex angles are greater than 180°, and the given angles are all less than 180°. 

This is very confusing. Given the time I've spent without resolving this contradiction, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that there's a typo and one of the angle measures is different. For example, if Angle(X,Z,W) was 52° instead of 24°, then the sum would be 105 + 23 + 52 = 180°. But since the problem states 24°, this is not helpful. 

Alternatively, perhaps the given angles are not all in triangle WXZ. Let me consider that Angle(W,X,Z) is part of triangle WXZ, Angle(X,W,Z) is part of another triangle, and Angle(X,Z,W) is part of a different triangle. 

But how? For example, Angle(X,W,Z) could be part of triangle XWY, and Angle(X,Z,W) could be part of triangle XZY. 

Let me try to think about the right angles again. 

There's a right angle at X (between Y and Z), so in triangle YXZ, which is right-angled at X. Let's assume that triangle YXZ is right-angled at X, with legs XY and XZ, and hypotenuse YZ. 

Also, there are right angles at Y: between X and W, and between Z and W. So, at Y, lines YX and YW are perpendicular, and lines YZ and YW are perpendicular. Hence, YX and YZ are both perpendicular to YW, making them parallel. 

So, YX || YZ. 

Now, let's consider triangle WXY, which is right-angled at Y. So, it has legs YW and YX, and hypotenuse WX. Similarly, triangle ZYW is right-angled at Y, with legs YW and YZ, and hypotenuse ZW. 

Now, since YX || YZ, and both are perpendicular to YW, then the length of YX and YZ can be arbitrary, but let's assign variables. Let me denote YW as length 'a', YX as 'b', YZ as 'c'. 

Now, in triangle WXZ, which has points W, X, Z. Let's find its angles. 

To find the angles of triangle WXZ, we need to know the lengths of its sides. 

But without knowing the actual lengths, it's hard to compute. However, the given angles are 105°, 23°, and 24°, which don't add up. 

Alternatively, perhaps the given angles are not all in triangle WXZ, but some are external. For example, Angle(W,X,Z) = 105° could be an external angle. 

Wait, if Angle(W,X,Z) is an external angle at X, then it would be equal to the sum of the remote interior angles. Let's say it's an external angle, then it equals the sum of the angles at W and Z. If the external angle is 105°, then the sum of the remote interior angles (at W and Z) would be 105°. But the given angle at W is 23°, and at Z is 24°, which sum to 47°, not 105°. So that doesn't fit. 

Alternatively, maybe one of the angles is an external angle. 

This is getting too convoluted. Given the time I've invested without progress, perhaps I should look for another approach. 

Let me focus on the right angles and see if I can derive some relations. 

From the right angles at Y, we have YX ⊥ YW and YZ ⊥ YW, so YX || YZ. 

Let me consider triangles involving these lines. 

In triangle YXZ, right-angled at X, with legs YX and XZ, and hypotenuse YZ. 

In triangle WXY, right-angled at Y, with legs YX and YW, hypotenuse WX. 

In triangle ZYW, right-angled at Y, with legs YZ and YW, hypotenuse ZW. 

Now, since YX || YZ, and both are perpendicular to YW, then the lengths of YX and YZ can be considered as variables. Let me assign YX = a, YZ = b, YW = c. 

Now, in triangle YXZ, by Pythagoras: YZ² = YX² + XZ². Wait, no. Since it's right-angled at X, then YZ² = YX² + XZ². 

But XZ is the segment from X to Z. Since X is on YX and Z is on YZ, and YX || YZ, then XZ is a diagonal line connecting X to Z. 

But without knowing the exact positions, it's difficult to calculate. 

However, perhaps I can relate the angles in triangle WXZ. Let's try to find the angles of triangle WXZ. 

In triangle WXZ, the sides are WX, XZ, and ZW. 

Using the right triangles:

- In triangle WXY, WX = sqrt(YX² + YW²) = sqrt(a² + c²).
- In triangle ZYW, ZW = sqrt(YZ² + YW²) = sqrt(b² + c²).
- In triangle YXZ, XZ = sqrt(YZ² - YX²) if YX is one leg and YZ is hypotenuse. Wait, no. In triangle YXZ, right-angled at X, so YZ is hypotenuse. So YZ² = YX² + XZ². Hence, XZ = sqrt(YZ² - YX²) = sqrt(b² - a²).

Assuming b > a. 

Now, in triangle WXZ, the sides are:

- WX = sqrt(a² + c²)
- XZ = sqrt(b² - a²)
- ZW = sqrt(b² + c²)

Now, let's try to find the angles of triangle WXZ. 

Let me denote the angles at W, X, Z as α, β, γ respectively. 

Given that in the problem, Angle(W,X,Z) is 105°, which is angle at X, so β = 105°. 

Angle(X,W,Z) is at W, so α = 23°. 

Angle(X,Z,W) is at Z, so γ = 24°. 

But these sum to 105 + 23 + 24 = 152°, which is impossible. Hence, this confirms the contradiction. 

Given this, I must conclude that there's an error in the problem statement. However, since this is a hypothetical problem, perhaps I should proceed by ignoring the inconsistency and focusing on the other parts. 

Wait, maybe the given angles are not all in triangle WXZ. Let me reconsider. 

Angle(W,X,Z) = 105° is at X, between W and Z. This is part of triangle WXZ. 

Angle(X,W,Z) = 23° is at W, between X and Z. This is part of triangle WXZ. 

Angle(X,Z,W) = 24° is at Z, between X and W. This is part of triangle WXZ. 

So, they must all be in triangle WXZ. Hence, the sum must be 180°, but it's not. 

This suggests that the problem is flawed, but since it's being asked, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that one of the angles is mistyped. For example, if Angle(X,Z,W) is 52° instead of 24°, then the sum would be 105 + 23 + 52 = 180°. 

Assuming that, let's proceed. 

If Angle(X,Z,W) is 52°, then in triangle WXZ, angles are 105° at X, 23° at W, and 52° at Z. 

Now, let's try to find m∠1, which is presumably one of these angles or another angle in the figure. 

But without knowing which angle ∠1 refers to, it's challenging. However, the answer choices are numerical, suggesting that ∠1 is one of the angles we need to calculate. 

Alternatively, perhaps ∠1 is one of the right angles? But they are already given as 90°, which isn't among the options. 

Alternatively, ∠1 could be an angle formed by the intersection of lines, like in the right triangles. 

Wait, the right angles are at X, Y, and Y. Let me think about the other angles. 

In triangle WXZ, if the angles are 105°, 23°, and 52° (assuming correction), then the angles at W and Z are 23° and 52°, and at X is 105°. 

Now, let's consider the other triangles. 

In triangle WXY, right-angled at Y, with angles at Y = 90°, at W = ?, at X = ?. 

Similarly, in triangle ZYW, right-angled at Y, with angles at Y = 90°, at Z = ?, at W = ?. 

But without knowing side lengths, it's hard to calculate. 

Alternatively, perhaps using trigonometry in triangle WXZ. 

If we assume that in triangle WXZ, angle at X is 105°, at W is 23°, and at Z is 52° (assuming correction), then using the Law of Sines:

WX / sin(52°) = XZ / sin(23°) = WZ / sin(105°)

But without knowing any sides, this might not help. 

Alternatively, if we consider the right triangles at Y. 

In triangle WXY, right-angled at Y, with legs YX and YW. Let's call YX = a, YW = b, so WX = sqrt(a² + b²). 

In triangle ZYW, right-angled at Y, with legs YZ and YW. Let's call YZ = c, YW = b, so ZW = sqrt(c² + b²). 

In triangle YXZ, right-angled at X, with legs YX and XZ, hypotenuse YZ. So, YZ² = YX² + XZ² → c² = a² + XZ² → XZ = sqrt(c² - a²). 

Now, in triangle WXZ, sides are:

- WX = sqrt(a² + b²)
- XZ = sqrt(c² - a²)
- ZW = sqrt(b² + c²)

Now, using the Law of Cosines in triangle WXZ for angle at X (105°):

ZW² = WX² + XZ² - 2 * WX * XZ * cos(angle at X)

Substituting:

(b² + c²) = (a² + b²) + (c² - a²) - 2 * sqrt(a² + b²) * sqrt(c² - a²) * cos(105°)

Simplifying left side: b² + c²

Right side: a² + b² + c² - a² - 2 * ... = b² + c² - 2 * ... 

Thus:

b² + c² = b² + c² - 2 * sqrt(a² + b²) * sqrt(c² - a²) * cos(105°)

Which simplifies to:

0 = -2 * sqrt(...) * cos(105°)

This implies that cos(105°) = 0, which is false, since cos(105°) ≈ -0.2588. Hence, this equation is not satisfied, indicating inconsistency. 

This further confirms the contradiction in the problem. 

Given that I'm unable to resolve the contradictions in the given premises, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the available information. 

Assuming that there was a typo and one of the angles is different, let's say that Angle(X,Z,W) is 52° instead of 24°, making the sum 180°. Then, in triangle WXZ, angles are 105°, 23°, and 52°. Now, let's look for ∠1. 

If ∠1 is one of these angles, it could be 52°, which is option C. Or, if ∠1 is another angle, like in one of the right triangles. 

Alternatively, let's consider the right angles and other angles. 

In triangle WXY, right-angled at Y, with angle at W being 23° (if Angle(X,W,Z) is 23°). Wait, no, Angle(X,W,Z) is at W, which is part of triangle WXZ. 

Alternatively, in triangle WXY, the angles are 90° at Y, and the other two angles at W and X. Let's say angle at W is α and at X is β. 

If we can find α and β, perhaps ∠1 is one of them. 

But how? Without knowing side lengths, it's hard. 

Alternatively, if we assume that in triangle WXY, angle at W is 23°, then angle at X would be 67° (since 90 + 23 + 67 = 180). But this is speculative. 

If ∠1 is 67°, but that's not an option. 

Alternatively, if ∠1 is the remaining angle in some triangle. 

Given the confusion, and assuming that the intended answer is C (52.5), which is half of 105°, maybe it relates to some bisected angle. 

Alternatively, since the given angles include 105°, 23°, 24°, and right angles, perhaps ∠1 is the difference between 90° and 23°, giving 67°, but that's not an option. 

Alternatively, using supplementary angles. 

Given the lack of clarity, and the presence of 105°, 23°, 24°, and right angles, perhaps ∠1 is 180° - 105° - 23° = 52°, which is close to option C (52.5). 

Assuming that there was a rounding error, and the intended answer is 52.5°, which is option C. 

Hence, I'll choose option C.
