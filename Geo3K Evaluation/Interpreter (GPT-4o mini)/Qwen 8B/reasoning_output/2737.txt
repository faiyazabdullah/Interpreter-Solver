Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we need to find the length of AB, denoted as x, given some conditions about a triangle ABC. Let me go through the given predicates step by step.

First, the RightAngle predicate says that angle at B is a right angle because it's Angle(A,B,C). Wait, actually, the syntax here might mean that the angle at point B between points A and C is a right angle. So, Triangle ABC has a right angle at B. That means triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at B.

Then, there's another predicate: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,B)), 52). Hmm, so the measure of angle at C, between points A, C, B? Wait, angle ACB would be at point C. Wait, the notation Angle(A,C,B) refers to the angle at point C, formed by points A, C, B. So that angle is 52 degrees. So, in triangle ABC, angle at C is 52 degrees. Since it's a right-angled triangle at B, the angles at A and C must add up to 90 degrees. Because the sum of angles in a triangle is 180, and one angle is already 90 degrees.

So, angle at B is 90°, angle at C is 52°, so angle at A would be 180 - 90 - 52 = 38 degrees. So, angle at A is 38°, angle at C is 52°, right angle at B.

Next, Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C)), 13). So, the length of side AC is 13 units. In triangle ABC, AC is opposite the right angle at B. Wait, in a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle. But here, since the right angle is at B, the hypotenuse would be AC. Wait, no. Wait, if the right angle is at B, then sides AB and BC are the legs, and AC is the hypotenuse. So, AC is the hypotenuse, which has length 13.

We need to find the length of AB, which is one of the legs. Let me recall the trigonometric ratios here. In a right-angled triangle, the sine of an angle is opposite over hypotenuse, cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse, tangent is opposite over adjacent.

Let me consider angle at C, which is 52°. The side opposite to angle C is AB. The hypotenuse is AC = 13. So, sin(angle C) = AB / AC. Therefore, AB = AC * sin(angle C).

Alternatively, angle at A is 38°, and the side opposite to angle A is BC. But maybe using angle C is better here.

So, AB = AC * sin(52°). Let me compute that. First, convert 52 degrees to radians if needed, but I think calculators can handle degrees directly. Let me calculate sin(52°). 

Using calculator input: sin(52°) ≈ 0.7880. Then AB ≈ 13 * 0.7880 ≈ 10.244. Rounding to the nearest hundredth gives approximately 10.24. Looking at the options, that's option C.

Wait, but wait—let me verify again. Another way: Using the Law of Sines. In triangle ABC, with right angle at B. So, angles: angle B = 90°, angle C = 52°, angle A = 38°. The sides opposite these angles are: side opposite B is AC = 13 (hypotenuse), side opposite A is BC, and side opposite C is AB.

Law of Sines: AB / sin(C) = AC / sin(B). Since angle B is 90°, sin(B) = 1. Therefore, AB = AC * sin(C) = 13 * sin(52°). Which is the same as before. So yes, AB ≈ 13 * 0.7880 ≈ 10.244, which rounds to 10.24. So answer C.

But let me check if there's another approach. Maybe using Pythagoras? For example, if we know angle C and hypotenuse, we could also use cos(angle A) or something else. Alternatively, maybe using tan(angle C) = opposite/adjacent. Wait, angle C is 52°, adjacent side would be BC, opposite is AB. So tan(52°) = AB / BC. But without knowing BC, perhaps not helpful. However, since we have the hypotenuse, maybe combining with Pythagoras. But since we have two angles and the hypotenuse, using sine is straightforward.

Another check: Let's compute 13*sin(52). Let me do more precise calculation. Let me get the exact value of sin(52°). Using a calculator, sin(52°):

Calculating 52 degrees. Let me confirm with a calculator. Assuming I don't have a calculator, but in reality, I can approximate. However, in an exam setting, one would use calculator functions. So assuming that sin(52°) is approximately 0.7880. Multiply by 13:

13 × 0.7880 = ?

Well, 10 × 0.7880 = 7.88, 3 × 0.7880 = 2.364. Total is 7.88 + 2.364 = 10.244. Rounded to the nearest hundredth is 10.24. So answer C.

Looking at the options, C is 10.24. Hence, the correct answer should be C.
