<think>
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. Hmm, the question is asking for the measure of angle FCE, given that lines p and q are parallel. Let me start by recalling the given predicates and how they relate to each other.

First, the problem mentions several angles and parallel lines. The given predicates include angles at points A, B, C, D, E, F, and relationships between lines being parallel. Specifically, Line AC is parallel to Line BF, and Line BD is parallel to Line CE. Also, there are measures given for angles ABC, ABD, and CFE in terms of variables x and y. Wait, but the actual question is about angle FCE, which I need to find based on these relationships.

Let me try to visualize the figure. Since there are parallel lines involved, maybe we can use properties of parallel lines and transversals. For example, corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, or same-side interior angles. But first, I need to map out the diagram based on the given information.

So, Points A, B, C, D, E, F are mentioned. Lines AC || BF and BD || CE. That suggests some sort of parallelogram or trapezoid? Maybe a more complex figure with intersecting lines. Let me think about how these lines interact.

Since AC is parallel to BF, and BD is parallel to CE, perhaps there are two pairs of parallel lines forming some kind of grid. Maybe point B is connected to D and F? Or maybe there are transversals cutting through these parallels. 

Looking at the angles given: Measure of Angle ABC (which would be angle at B between A and C) is y. Then angle ABD is 3x - 60. And angle CFE is 2x +15. The question asks for angle FCE, which is at point C between F and E. So angle FCE is part of triangle CFE or something?

Wait, the problem says p || q. Wait, in the original problem statement, it says "if p || q", so maybe p and q are the lines mentioned earlier, like AC || BF and BD || CE? Or maybe p and q refer to lines AC and BF, since those are parallel? Or BD and CE?

Alternatively, maybe the figure has lines labeled p and q, which are the parallel ones. But without seeing the figure, I have to rely on the given predicates. Let me parse the given predicates again.

Given:

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)), y): So angle ABC is y degrees.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,D)), 3x-60): So angle ABD is 3x -60 degrees.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,F,E)), 2x+15): So angle CFE is 2x +15 degrees.

- Parallel(Line(A,C), Line(B,F)): So line AC is parallel to line BF.

- Parallel(Line(B,D), Line(C,E)): So line BD is parallel to line CE.

Then, the question is to find measure of angle FCE, given that p || q. Wait, maybe p and q here refer to the parallel lines mentioned in the predicates. Like, p could be AC and BF, and q could be BD and CE? Or maybe another pair?

But regardless, since the problem gives us equations involving x and y, and wants us to find angle FCE, which is likely related to the variables x or y. However, the answer choices are numerical, so we need to solve for x or y first.

Let me consider the relationships between the angles. Since lines AC || BF and BD || CE, there might be some corresponding angles or alternate interior angles formed by the transversals.

For instance, considering line BD intersects lines AC and CE. Wait, BD is parallel to CE. So if BD is a transversal cutting through lines... Wait, BD is parallel to CE, so if there's a transversal crossing them, like line BC? Or another line?

Alternatively, maybe looking at triangle ABC and some other triangle. Wait, angle ABC is y, angle ABD is 3x -60. Since points A, B, D are connected, maybe BD is a segment extending from B. Similarly, AC is parallel to BF, so maybe BF is another line starting at B?

This is getting a bit confusing without the diagram. Let me try to sketch mentally. Suppose we have point B connected to A and D. Line AC is parallel to BF. So if AC is parallel to BF, then line BF starts at B and goes in the direction of AC. Similarly, BD is parallel to CE, so line CE starts at C and goes in the direction of BD.

Perhaps there are two sets of parallel lines creating a parallelogram-like structure. Let me consider that lines AC || BF and BD || CE. Therefore, the figure might involve a parallelogram or a combination of parallelograms.

Now, focusing on angles. Since AC || BF, and BD is a transversal, then angle ABC and angle BFD may be related. Wait, angle ABC is at point B between AB and BC. But BD is another line from B. So maybe angle ABD is adjacent to angle ABC?

Wait, angle ABC is y, and angle ABD is 3x -60. Are these adjacent angles? If BD is a line from B, then depending on where D is located, angles ABC and ABD could form a linear pair or something else.

Assuming that points A, B, D are arranged such that BD splits angle ABC into parts. Wait, but angle ABC is y, and angle ABD is 3x -60. If BD is inside angle ABC, then angle ABD plus angle DBC equals angle ABC. So, y = (3x -60) + angle DBC. But I don't know angle DBC yet.

Alternatively, since BD is parallel to CE, maybe there are some corresponding angles. For instance, if BD || CE, then a transversal cutting through them would create equal angles. For example, if line BC is a transversal intersecting BD and CE, then angle DBC would correspond to angle BCE. Because BD || CE, and BC is a transversal. So angle DBC equals angle BCE.

Similarly, since AC || BF, and BD is a transversal, then maybe angle ABC corresponds to some angle on BF. Let me think.

Let me try to write down equations based on the given info.

From the parallel lines:

1. AC || BF: So, if we consider line BD as a transversal, then angle ABC and angle BFD would be corresponding angles? Or alternate interior angles?

Wait, line AC is parallel to BF. So if BD is a transversal intersecting both AC and BF, then yes. At point B, BD intersects BF. Wait, BD is a line starting at B, and BF is another line starting at B. So BD and BF are two different lines from point B. Therefore, BD is not necessarily a transversal unless it crosses AC and BF. Wait, BD is parallel to CE, not sure yet.

Alternatively, since BD is parallel to CE, and assuming that line BC is a transversal, then angle between BD and BC would be equal to angle between CE and BC. So angle DBC equals angle ECB.

Let me denote angle DBC as θ. Then angle ECB is also θ because BD || CE.

Also, since AC || BF, if there's a transversal that creates some angles. For example, if line BC is a transversal cutting through AC and BF, then angle ABC (at B) would correspond to angle BFC (at F). So angle ABC = angle BFC.

But angle BFC is part of triangle BFC. Not sure yet.

But let's go back to angle relations. From the given, angle ABC is y. Angle ABD is 3x -60. Assuming that BD splits angle ABC into two parts, angle ABD and angle DBC. So:

y = (3x -60) + angle DBC.

Earlier, I said that angle DBC equals angle ECB (because BD || CE and BC is a transversal). So angle ECB = angle DBC = θ. Thus, angle ECB = θ.

Now, angle CFE is given as 2x +15. Let's see where angle CFE is. Point F, C, E. So angle at point C between F and E. Wait, angle CFE is at point F, between C and E? Wait, the notation MeasureOf(Angle(C,F,E)) means angle at F, between C and E. Wait, no, standard notation is Angle(C,F,E) is the angle at F between points C, F, E. So angle at F, with segments FC and FE.

But the question is asking for angle FCE, which is angle at C between F and E. So angle at C between F and E. So angle FCE is at point C, between F and E. Which would be part of triangle CFE.

Now, angle CFE is given as 2x +15, which is the angle at F in triangle CFE. Also, angle FCE is what we need to find. If we can find other angles in triangle CFE, we can find angle FCE.

In triangle CFE, sum of angles is 180 degrees. So angle at C (FCE) + angle at F (CFE) + angle at E = 180. So angle FCE = 180 - angle CFE - angle at E.

But we need to find angle at E. How?

Looking back at the parallel lines. Since BD || CE, and line BE is a transversal? Or line EC? Wait, BD || CE. Let me think about line CE. Since BD || CE, and if there is a transversal that connects them, say line BC, then angle at E would relate to angle DBC.

Earlier, we had angle DBC = angle ECB = θ. So angle at E, which is angle CEB, maybe? Wait, if we look at triangle CFE, angle at E is angle FEC. But how does that relate to other angles?

Alternatively, since BD || CE, and line CF is a transversal? Not sure. Alternatively, line BF is parallel to AC, so maybe there's a way to relate angles there.

Let me try to connect the dots. We have:

From angle ABC (y) = angle ABD (3x -60) + angle DBC (θ).

And angle DBC = θ = angle ECB.

So, angle ECB = θ.

In triangle CFE, angle at C is FCE, angle at F is CFE = 2x +15, angle at E is FEC.

So, FCE + CFE + FEC = 180 => FCE = 180 - CFE - FEC.

We need to find FEC. Let's see if we can express FEC in terms of other angles.

Since BD || CE, and line BE is a transversal. Wait, BD is parallel to CE. If line BE intersects BD and CE, then angle at B (angle DBC) is equal to angle at E (angle BEC), because they're alternate interior angles. Wait, if BD || CE and BE is a transversal, then angle DBC (at B) is equal to angle BEC (at E). So angle BEC = θ.

But angle BEC is the same as angle FEC if points are aligned correctly. Wait, depends on how the points are arranged. Assuming that E is on line CE, so angle FEC is part of angle BEC. Wait, maybe angle FEC is the same as angle BEC? Not sure. Need to clarify.

Alternatively, since line CE is parallel to BD, and line BC is a transversal, then angle between BD and BC (which is angle DBC = θ) is equal to angle between CE and BC (which is angle ECB = θ). So angle ECB is θ, which is part of triangle CFE.

Wait, angle ECB is at point C, between E and B. So angle ECB is adjacent to angle FCE? If point F is somewhere such that line CF forms angle FCE with CE. Wait, if we have point F connected to C and E, forming angle FCE.

Hmm, perhaps angle FCE and angle ECB are supplementary? If lines CF and CB form a straight line? No, not necessarily.

Alternatively, maybe triangle CFE and other triangles share angles.

Wait, going back to the previous equation:

In triangle CFE, angle FCE + angle CFE + angle FEC = 180.

Angle CFE is 2x +15.

Angle FEC is equal to angle BEC, which is θ (from BD || CE and transversal BE). Earlier, angle DBC = θ, which is part of angle ABC.

So angle FEC = θ.

Thus, substituting:

FCE + (2x +15) + θ = 180 => FCE = 180 - (2x +15) - θ.

But we also have from earlier:

y = (3x -60) + θ => θ = y - (3x -60) = y -3x +60.

Substituting θ into the equation for FCE:

FCE = 180 - (2x +15) - (y -3x +60)

= 180 -2x -15 -y +3x -60

Combine like terms:

(180 -15 -60) + (-2x +3x) - y

= 105 + x - y.

Therefore, FCE = x - y + 105.

But we need to find FCE, but we don't know x or y. So we need another equation relating x and y.

Looking back at the given predicates, angle ABC is y, which is angle at B between A and C. Also, angle ABD is 3x -60. If BD is a line from B, then angle ABD is adjacent to angle DBC, which we called theta. So y = angle ABD + angle DBC = (3x -60) + theta.

But we also have that angle ABC is y, and angle ABD is 3x -60. So unless there's another relationship, we need to find another equation involving x and y.

Wait, but we also have that line AC is parallel to BF. So maybe there's a way to relate angles here.

Considering line AC || BF, and line AB is a transversal. So angle BAC would correspond to angle ABF? Wait, but we don't have information about those angles directly.

Alternatively, since AC || BF, and BD is a transversal. Wait, BD is parallel to CE, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle ABD and some other triangle.

Alternatively, since AC || BF, and BD is a transveral, then angle ABC (at B) and angle BFD (at F) are corresponding angles. So angle ABC = angle BFD.

But angle BFD is part of triangle BFD or something else. Let me think.

If angle ABC = angle BFD, then angle BFD = y. Now, angle BFD is at point F, between B and D. But how does that help us?

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to link angle BFD with angle CFE, since angle CFE is given as 2x +15. Not sure yet.

Alternatively, since BD || CE, and line BF is parallel to AC. Maybe there are similar triangles or some proportionality.

Wait, this seems too vague. Let me think of another approach.

We have two expressions involving x and y. One was from the triangle CFE: FCE = x - y + 105. Another equation comes from the fact that angle ABC = y = (3x -60) + theta, and theta = angle ECB. Also, angle ECB relates to other angles.

But how to get another equation?

Wait, maybe there's another relationship involving angle FCE. Since line BF is parallel to AC, and line CE is parallel to BD. Perhaps some vertical angles or something.

Alternatively, since BD || CE, and AC || BF, maybe the entire figure is made up of parallelograms or something. If AC || BF and BD || CE, then maybe quadrilateral AECF is a parallelogram? Or some other shape.

Alternatively, if AC || BF and BD || CE, then the intersection of these lines creates certain angles. For example, if lines AC and BF are parallel, and lines BD and CE are parallel, then the figure could be a parallelogram or a rectangle, but without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to tell.

Wait, maybe considering that lines AC and BF are parallel, and lines BD and CE are parallel. So if we imagine lines AC and BF as one set of parallels, and BD and CE as another set. This might form a three-dimensional figure, but since we are dealing with planar geometry, it's probably a plane with intersecting lines.

Another thought: Since BD || CE, and AC || BF, maybe there are some transversals that create congruent angles. For example, if line CF is a transversal cutting through AC || BF, then angles would be equal.

But I'm stuck here. Let me try to recap what I have:

Equation 1: y = 3x -60 + theta.

Equation 2: FCE = x - y + 105.

But I need another equation to relate x and y. Where else can I find such an equation?

Maybe from the fact that angle CFE is 2x +15, and angle CFE is part of triangle CFE. Also, angle CFE is at point F, which might be related to other angles via the parallel lines.

Wait, if AC || BF, then angle at F (like angle BFC) might be equal to angle at A (like angle BAC), due to corresponding angles. But without knowing more about other angles, it's tricky.

Alternatively, since BD || CE, and line BF is parallel to AC, maybe there's a way to relate angles at different points.

Alternatively, let's consider that angle FCE is what we need to find, and we expressed it in terms of x and y: FCE = x - y + 105. But we need to find x and y.

Wait, but we have another relation from angle ABC. Let me think. Is there another angle that involves y?

Alternatively, since angle ABC is y, and angle ABD is 3x -60. If BD is a line from B, then maybe there's a triangle involving those angles. For example, in triangle ABD, we might have angles summing to 180. But without more info, it's unclear.

Wait, unless there's a way to relate angle ABD with other angles. For example, if line BD is parallel to CE, then maybe angle ABD is related to angle BCE or something.

Wait, earlier, we had that angle DBC = theta = angle ECB. Also, angle ABC = y = (3x -60) + theta. So theta = y - 3x +60.

Additionally, in triangle CFE, we have angle FCE = x - y + 105. But we need to find FCE, which is the answer. But we still have two variables x and y.

Is there another equation involving x and y?

Wait, maybe angle CFE (given as 2x +15) is related to other angles. For example, if line CF is a transversal to the parallel lines AC || BF, then angle CFE could be equal to some other angle.

Let me try that. Since AC || BF, and line CF is a transversal. Then, angle between AC and CF (which would be angle ACF) is equal to angle between BF and CF (which would be angle BFC). So angle ACF = angle BFC.

But angle ACF is part of angle ACB (assuming points are arranged such that F is on the extension of some line). Not sure.

Alternatively, angle BFC is equal to angle ACF. If we can express angle BFC in terms of other angles, maybe.

But angle BFC is at point F, between B and C. Wait, earlier I considered that angle BFC equals angle ABC because of parallel lines. Wait, if AC || BF, and line BC is a transversal, then angle ABC (at B) would be equal to angle BFC (at F), because they are corresponding angles.

Yes! That seems right. So angle ABC = angle BFC. Therefore, angle BFC = y.

But angle BFC is part of triangle BFC. In triangle BFC, angles are at B, F, C. So angle at B is angle FBC, angle at F is angle BFC = y, and angle at C is angle BCF.

Sum of angles in triangle BFC is 180: angle FBC + y + angle BCF = 180.

But angle FBC is angle at B between F and C. Which might be related to other angles. For example, angle FBC is part of angle ABD or something else.

Wait, angle FBC could be angle ABD if points are arranged properly. Wait, if line BF is parallel to AC, and line BD is connected to B, then angle ABD and angle FBC might be related. Wait, if BD is parallel to CE, and BF is parallel to AC, maybe there's a way to relate these.

Alternatively, since line BD is parallel to CE, and line BF is parallel to AC, then maybe there's a rotational symmetry or something.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to proceed step by step.

We have angle BFC = y. And in triangle BFC, angle FBC + y + angle BCF = 180.

But angle BCF is the same as angle BCD if D is on line CD? Not sure. Alternatively, angle BCF is part of angle ACB.

Wait, angle ACB is at point C between A and B. But angle BCF is at point C between B and F. So if points A, C, F are colinear? Not necessarily. It depends on the diagram.

Alternatively, since line AC is parallel to BF, and line CF is a transversal, angle between AC and CF (angle ACF) equals angle between BF and CF (angle BFC = y). So angle ACF = y.

But angle ACF is at point C between A and F. So angle ACF = y.

Now, angle ACF is part of angle ACE if F is on the same side. Not sure.

But in triangle CFE, angle at C is FCE. If angle ACF is y, and angle FCE is part of that, then maybe angle ACF = angle FCE + angle ECA? Or something like that. Depending on where E is located.

Alternatively, since line CE is parallel to BD, and angle DBC = theta = angle ECB. Earlier, angle ECB = theta = y -3x +60.

So angle ECB = theta = y -3x +60.

But angle ECB is at point C between E and B. So if we consider line CE, then angle ECB is adjacent to angle FCE if F is on the same line as A. Not sure.

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Let me try to summarize what I have:

From before:

1. y = 3x -60 + theta

2. theta = y -3x +60

3. FCE = x - y + 105

But I need another equation. Let me see if I can relate angle ACF (which is y) to other angles.

From the parallel lines AC || BF, angle ACF = angle BFC = y.

Also, angle ACF is part of angle ACB (if F is on the extension of CB). Wait, not sure. Alternatively, if line CF is a transversal, then angle ACF = y.

But angle ACF is at point C between A and F. So if I can express angle ACF in terms of other angles.

Suppose that angle ACF = y. Also, angle ACF is adjacent to angle FCE if points A, C, E are arranged in a way that FCE is part of angle ACF. For example, if line CE extends from C through E, then angle FCE would be part of angle ACF.

But unless there's a specific arrangement, this is speculative.

Alternatively, since line CE is parallel to BD, and line CF is a transversal, then angle between CE and CF (which is angle ECF) is equal to angle between BD and CF.

But angle between BD and CF would depend on where D is.

This is really challenging without the diagram. Let me try to think differently.

Let me assume that the equations I have are sufficient. From equation 1 and 2, they seem redundant. Wait, equation 1 is y = 3x -60 + theta, and equation 2 is theta = y -3x +60. These are essentially the same equation, just rearranged. So no new information.

Thus, I need another equation involving x and y. Let me think about the angle CFE, which is given as 2x +15. How is this related to other angles?

In triangle CFE, we had FCE = x - y +105. Also, angle CFE = 2x +15. And angle FEC = theta = y -3x +60.

So, in triangle CFE:

FCE + CFE + FEC = 180

=> (x - y +105) + (2x +15) + (y -3x +60) = 180

Let me compute this:

Expand terms:

x - y +105 + 2x +15 + y -3x +60

Combine like terms:

(x + 2x -3x) + (-y + y) + (105 +15 +60)

Which simplifies to:

0x + 0y + 180 = 180

Which gives 180 = 180. So this doesn't provide new information. Hence, my previous equations are consistent but do not allow me to solve for x and y.

Hmm. So I need another approach.

Let me revisit the assumption that angle BFC = y. This came from AC || BF and BC being a transversal. So angle ABC = angle BFC = y. If that's true, then in triangle BFC, we have angles summing to 180:

angle FBC + y + angle BCF = 180.

But angle FBC is angle at B between F and C. What is this angle?

If line BD is parallel to CE, and line BF is parallel to AC, then maybe angle FBC is related to angle ABD or something.

Wait, angle ABD is 3x -60. If line BF is parallel to AC, and line BD is a transversal, then angle ABD and angle FBC might be supplementary or equal?

Wait, since AC || BF, and BD is a transversal. So, angle between AC and BD (which is angle ABD) is equal to the angle between BF and BD (which is angle FBD). Because of alternate interior angles.

Wait, if AC || BF, and BD is a transversal, then angle ABD (on AC side) is equal to angle FBD (on BF side). So angle ABD = angle FBD.

But angle FBD is part of angle FBC if points are arranged such that D is on line BC. Wait, if D is on line BC, then angle FBD is part of angle FBC. So angle FBC = angle FBD + angle DBC.

But angle FBD = angle ABD = 3x -60, and angle DBC = theta = y -3x +60.

So angle FBC = (3x -60) + (y -3x +60) = y.

Which is consistent with our previous finding that angle FBC + y + angle BCF = 180, and angle FBC = y. So substituting:

y + y + angle BCF = 180 => 2y + angle BCF = 180 => angle BCF = 180 - 2y.

But angle BCF is the same as angle ACF, which we previously said equals y (from AC || BF and transversal CF). Wait, this leads to a contradiction unless y = 180 - 2y => 3y = 180 => y = 60.

Wait, this is promising. Let me check again:

From above, angle BCF = 180 - 2y.

But angle BCF is also equal to y (from AC || BF, leading to angle ACF = angle BFC = y). So:

y = 180 - 2y => 3y = 180 => y = 60 degrees.

Ah! Now we have y = 60 degrees. Great!

So now we can substitute y = 60 into our previous equations.

Recall that angle FCE = x - y + 105. Since y = 60, this becomes x - 60 + 105 = x + 45.

But we need to find x. How?

Let me recall that angle ABD = 3x -60. And angle ABD is also equal to angle FBD, which we found earlier. Also, angle FBC = y = 60 degrees, and angle FBC = angle FBD + angle DBC = (3x -60) + theta.

But theta = y -3x +60 = 60 -3x +60 = 120 -3x.

Wait, earlier we had theta = y -3x +60. With y = 60, theta = 60 -3x +60 = 120 -3x.

But angle FBC = angle FBD + angle DBC = (3x -60) + theta = (3x -60) + (120 -3x) = 60 degrees, which matches with angle FBC = y = 60. So this checks out, but it doesn't give us new info about x.

But we need another equation involving x. Let's think about the angle CFE = 2x +15. How is this related to other angles?

Earlier, in triangle CFE, we had angle CFE = 2x +15, angle FEC = theta = 120 -3x, and angle FCE = x +45.

Sum of angles: (x +45) + (2x +15) + (120 -3x) = ?

Calculate:

x +45 +2x +15 +120 -3x = (x +2x -3x) + (45 +15 +120) = 0x + 180 = 180. Again, this is an identity, giving no new information.

Hmm. So we need another way to find x.

Let me think about the angle ACF = y = 60 degrees. Angle ACF is at point C between A and F. If angle ACF is 60 degrees, and angle FCE is x +45, then depending on how F and E are positioned, angle ACE might be related.

Wait, if angle ACF = 60, and angle FCE = x +45, and angle ACE = angle ACF + angle FCE if points F and E are on opposite sides of line AC. Or if they are on the same side, subtract.

But without knowing the diagram, it's hard to say. However, since angle CFE is given as 2x +15, which is part of triangle CFE, and angle CFE is at point F, perhaps there's a way to relate this angle to others.

Alternatively, since line CE is parallel to BD, and line BF is parallel to AC, maybe there's a way to find x using the fact that angle CFE is related to other angles via parallel lines.

Wait, line CE || BD, and line CF is a transversal. So angle between CE and CF (which is angle ECF) should be equal to angle between BD and CF. Let me define angle ECF as part of angle FCE.

Wait, angle ECF is the same as angle FCE, which is x +45. And angle between BD and CF is equal to angle ECF. But what is angle between BD and CF?

Line BD is parallel to CE, so angle between BD and CF is equal to angle between CE and CF, which is angle ECF = x +45. But how does this help?

Alternatively, since line BD is parallel to CE, and line CF is a transversal, then angle between BD and CF is equal to angle between CE and CF, which is angle ECF = x +45.

But angle between BD and CF is also related to other angles. For example, if we consider triangle BCF, angle at D is ... wait, no. Line BD is parallel to CE, and line CF is a transversal. So angle between BD and CF (let's call it alpha) is equal to angle between CE and CF (which is angle ECF = x +45). So alpha = x +45.

But alpha is also equal to angle between BD and CF. Let me think about triangle BDF or something. Wait, line BD is connected to point B, and line CF is connected to point C. Not sure.

Alternatively, since angle ABD = 3x -60, and angle ABD is equal to angle FBD (as per parallel lines AC || BF), and angle FBD is part of angle FBC = 60 degrees. Earlier, we had angle FBC = angle FBD + angle DBC = (3x -60) + theta = 60 degrees. And theta = 120 -3x.

But we already used that. Still no new info.

Wait, but angle ABD = 3x -60. And angle ABD is part of angle ABC, which is y = 60. So:

y = angle ABD + angle DBC => 60 = (3x -60) + theta.

But theta = 120 -3x, so:

60 = (3x -60) + (120 -3x) => 60 = 60. Again, no new information.

So it seems like we cannot determine x from these equations. This suggests that there might be missing information, or perhaps another relationship I haven't considered.

Wait, the problem provides answer choices, so maybe there's a way to find x from the answer choices. Let me think about that.

We have angle FCE = x +45. The answer choices are A.105, B.110, C.115, D.120. So if we suppose that angle FCE is one of these options, then x +45 equals one of them. Let's check:

Option A: x +45 = 105 → x = 60.

Option B: x +45 = 110 → x = 65.

Option C: x +45 = 115 → x = 70.

Option D: x +45 = 120 → x = 75.

But how to determine which one is correct?

Let me think about angle CFE = 2x +15. If we can find x from this angle in relation to other angles.

But without more info, it's difficult. Wait, but maybe there's a constraint that all angles must be positive.

For example, angle ABD = 3x -60 must be positive, so 3x -60 > 0 → x > 20.

Also, angle CFE = 2x +15 must be positive, which it always is if x > -15, which it is.

But this doesn't narrow down x much.

Wait, but angle DBC = theta = 120 -3x. Since theta is an angle in a triangle, it must be positive. So 120 -3x > 0 → x < 40.

So x is between 20 and 40.

So possible x values are between 20 and 40.

Looking at the options:

If x = 60 (option A), then x is outside of this range (since x < 40). So invalid.

If x = 65 (option B), also invalid.

x = 70 (option C) invalid.

x = 75 (option D) invalid.

Wait, this suggests that none of the options satisfy x < 40. But this contradicts. What's wrong here?

Wait, earlier I concluded that theta = 120 -3x, and theta must be positive, so 120 -3x > 0 → x < 40. But if x is less than 40, then angle FCE = x +45. Let's take x = 30, for example. Then FCE = 75, which isn't among the options. But the options are 105, 110, etc., which would require x to be larger than 60. But this conflicts with x < 40. So something is wrong.

This indicates an error in my previous reasoning. Let me backtrack.

Where did I make a mistake?

Earlier, I assumed that angle BCF = 180 - 2y, and also angle BCF = y. This led to y = 60. But why is angle BCF equal to y?

That was based on the assumption that angle ACF = y, because AC || BF and CF is a transversal. But maybe this assumption is incorrect.

Let me re-examine that. If AC || BF, and CF is a transversal, then the corresponding angles would be angle between AC and CF (which is angle ACF) equal to angle between BF and CF (which is angle BFC). So angle ACF = angle BFC. But angle BFC is y, so angle ACF = y. So this part is correct.

Then, in triangle BCF, angle BCF is the same as angle ACF, which is y. Wait, no. Angle BCF is at point C between B and F. Angle ACF is at point C between A and F. So unless points A, B, and F are collinear, which they aren't, these angles are different.

Oh! Here's the mistake. I incorrectly assumed that angle BCF = angle ACF, but actually, angle BCF is a different angle from angle ACF. This is where the error occurred.

So angle ACF is at point C between A and F, while angle BCF is at point C between B and F. Unless points A, B, and F are collinear, which they aren't, these are separate angles. So my previous conclusion that angle BCF = y was wrong. That explains why the inconsistency arose.

So let's redo that part.

We have angle ACF = y (from AC || BF and transversal CF). Angle BCF is a different angle. So in triangle BCF, angles are:

At B: angle FBC

At F: angle BFC = y

At C: angle BCF

Sum: angle FBC + y + angle BCF = 180.

But angle FBC is equal to angle FBD + angle DBC. As before, angle FBD = angle ABD = 3x -60, and angle DBC = theta = y -3x +60.

So angle FBC = (3x -60) + (y -3x +60) = y.

Thus, in triangle BCF, we have:

y + y + angle BCF = 180 → angle BCF = 180 - 2y.

But angle BCF is not the same as angle ACF. So angle BCF = 180 - 2y.

Now, angle BCF is at point C between B and F. How is this related to other angles?

Maybe angle BCF is part of angle FCE or something. For example, if line CE passes through point C, then angle BCF could be related to angle FCE.

But without knowing the exact diagram, it's still challenging. Let me think about the relationship between angle BCF and angle FCE.

If line CE is parallel to BD, and line CF is a transversal, then angle between CE and CF (which is angle ECF) is equal to angle between BD and CF. Let me call this angle beta.

Since BD || CE, and CF is a transversal, angle between BD and CF (beta) = angle between CE and CF (angle ECF).

But angle beta is also equal to angle between BD and CF. What is this angle?

Line BD is connected to point B, and line CF is connected to point C. So angle between BD and CF is at point B or point C? It depends on where the lines meet. If line BD and CF intersect at some point, but without knowing the diagram, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, if we consider line CF and line BD, they might form some angle at point B or C. This is too ambiguous.

Alternatively, since angle BCF = 180 - 2y, and angle BCF is at point C between B and F, and angle FCE is at point C between F and E. If points B, C, E are arranged such that angle BCF and angle FCE are adjacent, forming angle BCE.

Wait, angle BCE is at point C between B and E. Which is equal to angle DBC = theta (since BD || CE, and BC is a transversal). Earlier, we had theta = y -3x +60.

So angle BCE = theta = y -3x +60.

But angle BCE is composed of angle BCF + angle FCE if points F and E are on opposite sides of line BC. Or it could be angle BCF - angle FCE, depending on the arrangement.

Assuming that points F and E are on opposite sides of BC, then angle BCE = angle BCF + angle FCE.

So:

theta = angle BCE = angle BCF + angle FCE.

We have angle BCF = 180 - 2y, and angle FCE = x +45 (earlier expression, but let's verify).

Wait, earlier I had FCE = x - y +105. But that was under the incorrect assumption that angle BCF = y, which was wrong. Let me re-derive FCE.

Previously, in triangle CFE, we had:

angle FCE + angle CFE + angle FEC = 180.

We had angle CFE = 2x +15.

Angle FEC = theta = y -3x +60.

So FCE = 180 - (2x +15) - (y -3x +60) = 180 -2x -15 -y +3x -60 = x - y + 105.

So FCE = x - y +105.

But now, with angle BCE = theta = y -3x +60 = angle BCF + FCE = (180 - 2y) + FCE.

So:

y -3x +60 = (180 - 2y) + (x - y +105)

Let me expand this:

Left side: y -3x +60

Right side: 180 -2y + x - y +105 = 180 +105 + x -3y = 285 + x -3y

Setting left = right:

y -3x +60 = 285 + x -3y

Bring all terms to left:

y -3x +60 -285 -x +3y = 0

Combine like terms:

(y +3y) + (-3x -x) + (60 -285) = 0

4y -4x -225 = 0

Divide both sides by 4:

y - x - 56.25 = 0 → y = x + 56.25

Now, we have a new equation: y = x + 56.25.

But we also know from earlier that y = 60? No, that was based on an incorrect assumption. Let me check.

No, earlier assumption about angle BCF = y was wrong. So now, we have this new equation: y = x + 56.25.

But we also have from the equation where angle FBC = y, and angle FBC = (3x -60) + theta, where theta = y -3x +60. But this gave us y = y, so no new info.

However, now we have y = x + 56.25.

Let me recall that angle ABD = 3x -60, and this must be positive, so 3x -60 > 0 → x > 20.

Also, angle DBC = theta = y -3x +60 = (x +56.25) -3x +60 = -2x + 116.25. This must be positive, so -2x + 116.25 > 0 → x < 58.125.

So x is between 20 and 58.125.

Now, we also have angle CFE = 2x +15. This must be positive, which it is.

Now, we need to find x. How?

Let me recall that angle FCE = x - y +105, and y = x +56.25.

Substitute y into FCE:

FCE = x - (x +56.25) +105 = -56.25 +105 = 48.75 degrees.

But this is not
