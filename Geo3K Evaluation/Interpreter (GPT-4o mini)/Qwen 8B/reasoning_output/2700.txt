MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the figure they describe. Let me start by listing out each predicate and see how they fit together.

So, the first predicate is Rectangle(A, B, D, C). That tells me that ABCD is a rectangle. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. But wait, there are some other predicates here that might modify this. Let me check the others.

Next, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A, C, D)), 30). Hmm, Angle at point C between points A, C, D. Wait, in a rectangle, all angles are 90 degrees. So this seems contradictory unless maybe the figure isn't a rectangle? Or perhaps there's a mistake here. Wait, but the first predicate says it's a rectangle. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation. Let me think again about the angle notation.

In angle notation, Angle(X, Y, Z) refers to the angle at point Y formed by points X-Y-Z. So Angle(A, C, D) would be the angle at point C between points A-C-D. But in a standard rectangle, each corner is a right angle. So if ABCD is a rectangle, then the angle at C should be 90 degrees. However, the given measure is 30 degrees. That doesn't align. There must be something wrong here. Wait, maybe the figure isn't a rectangle? But the first predicate says Rectangle(A, B, D, C). Wait, rectangles have four right angles, so having one angle as 30 degrees contradicts that. Therefore, perhaps there's a misinterpretation here. Maybe the figure isn't a rectangle? Or perhaps the points aren't labeled in order?

Wait, maybe the rectangle is named differently. Let me recall that in a rectangle, consecutive vertices are connected in order. So if it's Rectangle(A, B, D, C), does that mean the rectangle has vertices A, B, D, C in order? Then the sides would be AB, BD, DC, and CA? Wait, that doesn't make sense because in a rectangle, adjacent vertices are connected by sides. Wait, maybe the rectangle is A-B-C-D-A? But the given name is Rectangle(A, B, D, C), which could imply different connections. Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is A-B-C-D-A, but the order is different. Maybe the labeling is such that the rectangle's corners are A, B, D, C, but arranged in a way that creates non-right angles? That doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that it's a rectangle is incorrect? Or maybe the other predicates override that?

Let me check the other predicates. RightAngle(Angle(B, A, C)) and RightAngle(Angle(A, D, B)). These indicate that angle at A between B-A-C is a right angle, and angle at B between A-D-B is a right angle. So, angle BAC is a right angle, and angle ABD is a right angle. Also, LengthOf(Line(A,B)) is 15, and LengthOf(Line(C,D)) is 15. 

Wait, if we consider the figure, maybe it's not a rectangle but another shape. Let me try to sketch mentally. Suppose points A, B, C, D form a quadrilateral where certain angles are right angles, and some sides are equal. Let me try to reconstruct the figure.

First, since there's a right angle at A between B-A-C, that suggests that BA is perpendicular to AC. Similarly, angle at B between A-D-B being a right angle means that AD is perpendicular to BC? Wait, no, angle at B between A-D-B would be angle at B between points A, B, D. So that's angle ABD, which is a right angle. So BA is perpendicular to BD. Also, angle at C between A-C-D is 30 degrees. 

This seems like a combination of a rectangle and some triangles. Let me try to visualize. Let me assume that point A is connected to B and C. Since angle BAC is a right angle, BA and AC are perpendicular. Also, angle at B between A and D is a right angle, so BD is perpendicular to BA. Therefore, BD is along the same line as AC? Because BA is perpendicular to both AC and BD. Wait, if BA is perpendicular to AC and BA is also perpendicular to BD, then AC and BD must be parallel? Because they're both perpendicular to BA. 

But in that case, if AC and BD are parallel, and ABCD is supposed to be a rectangle, but angle at C is 30 degrees. This is conflicting. So maybe the figure isn't a rectangle? Perhaps the initial assertion that it's a rectangle is incorrect? Or maybe there's a typo in the problem statement?

Alternatively, maybe the figure is a trapezoid or some other quadrilateral with two right angles. Let me try to proceed with the given information.

Given that Line AB has length 15, and Line CD has length 15. Also, angle at C (angle ACD) is 30 degrees. Let me try to model coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to the points to make calculations easier.

Assume point A is at origin (0,0). Since angle BAC is a right angle, and BA is one leg, AC is another. Let me suppose BA is along the y-axis and AC is along the x-axis. So, if A is at (0,0), then B could be at (0, b) and C at (c, 0). The length AB is 15, so distance from A(0,0) to B(0,b) is |b| = 15, so b=15. Thus, B is (0,15). Point C is (c,0).

Now, considering angle at B between A, B, D is a right angle. So angle ABD is 90 degrees. Since B is at (0,15), and BA is along negative y-axis from B to A (from (0,15) to (0,0)), then BD must be horizontal from B. So direction from B to D is along positive or negative x-axis. Let me assume it's along positive x-axis. So D would be somewhere along x-axis from B. Wait, but point D is part of the rectangle? Or maybe not. Wait, the original predicate said Rectangle(A, B, D, C). If that's a rectangle, then the order of the letters matters. If it's A-B-D-C-A, forming a rectangle, then sides AB, BD, DC, and CA. Wait, but BD would be a side. But BD's length? Not sure yet. 

Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is A-B-C-D-A. But then angle at C would be a right angle, conflicting with the given 30 degrees. Hence, contradiction. Therefore, the initial assumption that ABCD is a rectangle may be incorrect. Wait, but the first predicate says Rectangle(A, B, D, C). So according to that, ABCD is a rectangle. Which would require all angles to be 90 degrees. But given that angle at C is 30 degrees, which is impossible. Therefore, there's a contradiction unless my interpretation is wrong.

Perhaps the angle is not at point C? Wait, the angle is MeasureOf(Angle(A, C, D)), which is angle at C between A-C-D. So that's angle at C between points A, C, D. So if ABCD is a rectangle, then angle at C should be 90 degrees. But it's given as 30 degrees. Therefore, there's inconsistency here. Unless the figure isn't a rectangle, but the predicate is misleading. Or perhaps the points are not in order?

Wait, maybe the rectangle is not convex? Or maybe the points are not in order? For example, if the rectangle is A, B, D, C in a different order. Like A-B-C-D-A, but with labels swapped. Wait, but the predicate is Rectangle(A, B, D, C), which usually implies the order of the vertices. For example, a rectangle is typically named with vertices in cyclic order. So if it's Rectangle(A, B, D, C), then the order is A connected to B, B connected to D, D connected to C, C connected to A. So edges AB, BD, DC, and CA. But BD and CA would be diagonals? No, in a rectangle, diagonals are equal and bisect each other. But if BD is a side, then it's not a diagonal. So if ABCD is a rectangle, then AB, BC, CD, DA are sides. So if the rectangle is named A-B-D-C, that would suggest that the sides are AB, BD, DC, and CA. But BD and CA would be diagonals if it were a rectangle. Wait, but if it's a rectangle, then AB and DC are opposite sides, and BD and AC are diagonals. But in that case, BD would not be a side. Therefore, perhaps the initial predicate is incorrect, or there's confusion in the naming.

Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is actually a parallelogram with some properties? But the problem states it's a rectangle. Hmm. This seems confusing. Given the conflict between the angle at C being 30 degrees and the rectangle requiring right angles, perhaps the figure isn't a rectangle, but the problem has a mistake? Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the angle. Let me re-examine the angle.

Wait, angle ACD is at point C, between points A, C, D. So in the rectangle, if ABCD is a rectangle, then point D would be connected to C, making angle at C between D and A. Wait, if ABCD is a rectangle, then angle at C would be between B, C, D. So angle BCD. But the given angle is ACD. So that would be angle between A, C, D. If ABCD is a rectangle, then A, C are diagonal points. So in a rectangle, the diagonals intersect at the center, but the angle at C between A, C, D would depend on the rectangle's dimensions. Wait, maybe it's referring to a triangle? If you connect A to C and D to C, then angle at C between A and D. 

Wait, let's take coordinates again. Let me try assigning coordinates again, assuming ABCD is a rectangle. Let me say A is (0,0), B is (a,0), C is (a,b), D is (0,b). Then, angle at C would be between B, C, D. So angle BCD, which is 90 degrees. But the given angle is ACD, which is angle at C between A, C, D. In this coordinate system, point A is (0,0), C is (a,b), D is (0,b). So vector CA is from C to A: (-a, -b), and vector CD is from C to D: (-a, 0). The angle between these vectors would be computed using dot product. Let's calculate:

Vectors CA = A - C = (0 - a, 0 - b) = (-a, -b)

Vector CD = D - C = (0 - a, b - b) = (-a, 0)

Dot product of CA and CD: (-a)(-a) + (-b)(0) = a²

Magnitude of CA: sqrt(a² + b²)

Magnitude of CD: sqrt(a² + 0) = a

Thus, cos(theta) = (a²)/(sqrt(a² + b²)*a) ) = a / sqrt(a² + b²)

Therefore, theta = arccos(a / sqrt(a² + b²)) = arctan(b/a). Wait, because tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent = b/a. So theta = arctan(b/a). 

But the given angle is 30 degrees. So arctan(b/a) = 30°, implying that b/a = tan(30°) = 1/√3 ≈ 0.577. Therefore, b = a/√3.

Additionally, we know that LengthOf(Line(A,B)) is 15. Since AB is from (0,0) to (a,0), its length is a units. So a = 15. Therefore, b = 15 / √3 = 5√3 ≈ 8.66.

Also, LengthOf(Line(C,D)) is given as 15. In the rectangle, CD is from (a,b) to (0,b), so length is a, which we already set as 15. So that checks out. So in this scenario, the rectangle has sides of length a=15 and b=5√3. Therefore, the area of the rectangle would be a*b = 15*(5√3) = 75√3 ≈ 129.9. Which corresponds to option C.

But wait, earlier I thought there was a contradiction because angle at C in the rectangle is supposed to be 90 degrees, but here the angle ACD is 30 degrees. However, that's because angle ACD is not one of the internal angles of the rectangle; it's an angle formed by connecting A to C and D to C. So in this case, even though the rectangle's internal angles are 90 degrees, the angle between diagonal AC and side CD is 30 degrees. That makes sense. So the initial confusion was due to misunderstanding which angle is referred to.

So proceeding with this, the area of the rectangle would be length times width. We found a=15 and b=5√3. So area is 15*5√3 = 75√3 ≈ 75*1.732 ≈ 129.9. Which matches option C. 

Now, checking other predicates. The RightAngle(Angle(B, A, C)): Angle at A between B-A-C. In our coordinate setup, point A is (0,0), B is (15,0), and C is (15,5√3). So angle at A between B and C. Vector AB is (15,0) and vector AC is (15,5√3). The angle between them can be calculated via dot product. Let's compute:

AB · AC = (15)(15) + (0)(5√3) = 225

|AB| = 15

|AC| = sqrt(15² + (5√3)^2) = sqrt(225 + 75) = sqrt(300) = 10√3

cos(theta) = 225/(15*10√3) = 225/(150√3) = 3/(2√3) = √3/2. Therefore, theta is 30 degrees. Wait, but the predicate says it's a right angle. Oh no! There's a contradiction here. The RightAngle(Angle(B, A, C)) is supposed to hold, but according to this calculation, it's 30 degrees. What's wrong here?

Ah, this suggests an error in my assumptions. Earlier, I assumed that the angle ACD is 30 degrees, leading to b = a/√3, but that caused the angle at A (BAC) to be 30 degrees instead of a right angle. But the problem states that RightAngle(Angle(B, A, C)), i.e., angle at A between B and C is a right angle. So my previous assumption is invalid.

So where did I go wrong? Let me revisit. 

The problem gives two right angles: Angle(B, A, C) is a right angle, and Angle(A, D, B) is a right angle. Additionally, angle at C (Angle(A, C, D)) is 30 degrees. And lengths AB = 15, CD = 15.

So, starting over, let's use these constraints properly.

Let me define points with coordinates again, ensuring that angle at A between B and C is a right angle. Let me place point A at (0,0). Since angle BAC is a right angle, vectors AB and AC are perpendicular. Let me assume AB is along the x-axis and AC is along the y-axis. So point B is at (x, 0), point C is at (0, y). Then AB has length x, AC has length y. 

Given that LengthOf(Line(A,B)) is 15, so x = 15. Therefore, point B is (15, 0), point C is (0, y).

Now, the RightAngle(Angle(A, D, B)) means that angle at B between A, B, D is a right angle. So angle ABD is a right angle. So, at point B, the segments BA and BD form a right angle. Since BA is from B to A (which is towards the left along the x-axis), BD must be vertical upwards or downwards from B. Assuming the figure is above the x-axis, BD goes upward. So point D lies along the line perpendicular to BA at B. Since BA is horizontal (from B(15,0) to A(0,0)), BD is vertical. So D is at (15, k) for some k.

Now, the other condition is that angle at C between A, C, D is 30 degrees. Let's find coordinates of D such that angle ACD is 30 degrees. Point C is at (0, y), point D is at (15, k). We need angle at C between points A(0,0), C(0,y), D(15,k). So angle ACD is formed by lines CA and CD.

Vector CA is from C to A: (0 - 0, 0 - y) = (0, -y)

Vector CD is from C to D: (15 - 0, k - y) = (15, k - y)

We need the angle between vectors CA and CD to be 30 degrees. Using the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (CA · CD) / (|CA| * |CD|)

Compute CA · CD = (0)(15) + (-y)(k - y) = -y(k - y)

|CA| = sqrt(0^2 + (-y)^2) = y

|CD| = sqrt(15^2 + (k - y)^2) = sqrt(225 + (k - y)^2)

So,

cos(theta) = [-y(k - y)] / [y * sqrt(225 + (k - y)^2)] ) = -(k - y)/sqrt(225 + (k - y)^2)

Since theta is 30 degrees, cos(theta) = cos(30°) = √3/2 ≈ 0.866. However, the expression above is negative, because -(k - y) divided by positive denominator. But cosine of 30 degrees is positive. This suggests that either my calculation is wrong or the angle is measured in a different direction. Wait, maybe the angle is oriented such that the actual value is absolute. Or perhaps I made a sign error.

Alternatively, maybe the angle is measured as the acute angle between the vectors. Let's consider the magnitude:

The absolute value of the numerator is |-(k - y)| = |k - y|. So,

cos(theta) = |k - y| / sqrt(225 + (k - y)^2) = √3/2

Let me denote d = |k - y|, then:

d / sqrt(225 + d²) = √3 / 2

Square both sides:

d² / (225 + d²) = 3/4

Multiply both sides by denominator:

4d² = 3(225 + d²)

Expand:

4d² = 675 + 3d² → d² = 675 → d = sqrt(675) = 15√3 ≈ 25.98

So |k - y| = 15√3. Since D is likely positioned such that k > y (assuming the figure is constructed upwards), we have k = y + 15√3.

Now, we need more constraints to find y. Let's look at other conditions. The rectangle predicate: Rectangle(A, B, D, C). Wait, if ABCD is a rectangle, then the sides AB, BC, CD, DA must be equal and meet at right angles. But earlier, we've placed points A(0,0), B(15,0), C(0,y), D(15,k). To form a rectangle, the fourth side DA must be parallel and equal to BC. Let's check.

Vector BC is from B(15,0) to C(0,y): (-15, y)

Vector DA is from D(15,k) to A(0,0): (-15, -k)

For BC and DA to be equal and parallel, their vectors must be equal. So:

(-15, y) = (-15, -k) → y = -k. But earlier, we had k = y + 15√3. Combining these equations:

From y = -k and k = y + 15√3:

Substitute k = -y into second equation: y = -(-y) + 15√3 → y = y + 15√3 → 0 = 15√3, which is impossible. Contradiction again.

This suggests that my assumption that ABCD is a rectangle is incorrect. But the problem states it's a rectangle. Where is the error?

Maybe the rectangle is not A-B-C-D-A but another order. Let me reconsider the rectangle's definition. The rectangle could be A-B-D-C-A, meaning sides AB, BD, DC, and CA. So AB is from A to B, BD from B to D, DC from D to C, and CA from C to A. For this to be a rectangle, all angles must be right angles. So at point B, angle between AB and BD must be 90 degrees. At point D, angle between BD and DC must be 90 degrees, etc.

Earlier, we determined that point D is at (15, k), with k = y + 15√3. Now, let's ensure that BD is perpendicular to AB. AB is horizontal (from A(0,0) to B(15,0)), so BD must be vertical. As before, D is at (15, k). Now, DC connects D(15,k) to C(0,y). For angle at D between B-D-C to be a right angle, the vector DB and DC must be perpendicular. Vector DB is from D to B: (15-15, 0 - k) = (0, -k). Vector DC is from D to C: (0 - 15, y - k) = (-15, y - k). Their dot product should be zero:

DB · DC = (0)(-15) + (-k)(y - k) = -k(y - k) = 0 → -ky + k² = 0 → ky = k² → if k ≠ 0, then y = k.

But earlier, we had k = y + 15√3. Substituting y = k into this equation gives k = k + 15√3 → 0 = 15√3, which is impossible. Again, contradiction.

This indicates that under the given conditions, it's impossible for ABCD to be a rectangle. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding in interpreting the rectangle predicate. Perhaps the rectangle is not a standard rectangle but a different configuration, or the given angle is not within the rectangle? Or maybe the figure is not a rectangle but a different shape, and the predicate is misleading?

Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle refers to a different aspect. Let me try to forget the rectangle predicate for a moment and focus on the other conditions.

We have:

- Right angle at A between B and C (Angle(BAC) is 90°)
- Right angle at B between A and D (Angle(ABD) is 90°)
- Length AB = 15
- Length CD = 15
- Angle at C between A and D is 30°

With these, can we determine the figure's area?

Let me try to find coordinates again, ignoring the rectangle for now. 

As before, set A at (0,0), B at (15,0), and since angle BAC is 90°, C is at (0, y). Now, angle ABD is 90°, so D lies along the line perpendicular to AB at B, so D is at (15, k). Now, angle at C between A, C, D is 30°. From earlier, we found that |k - y| = 15√3, and k = y ± 15√3. Let's choose k = y + 15√3 (assuming D is above C).

Now, we need to relate this to the length CD = 15. CD is from C(0, y) to D(15, k). So the length CD is sqrt[(15-0)^2 + (k - y)^2] = sqrt[225 + (k - y)^2]. Given that CD = 15, so:

sqrt[225 + (k - y)^2] = 15 → square both sides: 225 + (k - y)^2 = 225 → (k - y)^2 = 0 → k = y. But earlier we had |k - y| = 15√3. This leads to 15√3 = 0, which is impossible. Contradiction again!

What's going on here? It appears that combining the given conditions leads to contradictions, suggesting an error in the problem setup or my understanding. However, the problem is presented as solvable, so I must have made a wrong assumption.

Let me re-express the conditions without assuming the rectangle. Let's treat it as a general quadrilateral with certain properties.

Given:

1. Right angle at A between B and C (so AB ⊥ AC).
2. Right angle at B between A and D (so AB ⊥ BD).
3. Angle at C between A and D is 30°.
4. Length AB = 15.
5. Length CD = 15.

Need to find the area of the figure. Possibly, the figure is a kite or another quadrilateral.

Let me attempt to model this again with coordinates.

Set A at (0,0), B at (15,0) (since AB = 15). Since angle BAC is 90°, AC is vertical. Let C be at (0, c). Now, angle ABD is 90°, so BD is vertical from B. Let D be at (15, d).

Now, CD is from C(0,c) to D(15,d). Its length is 15, so:

Distance CD = sqrt((15-0)^2 + (d - c)^2) = sqrt(225 + (d - c)^2) = 15 → 225 + (d - c)^2 = 225 → (d - c)^2 = 0 → d = c. So d = c.

But angle at C between A, C, D is 30°. Let's compute this angle. Points A(0,0), C(0,c), D(15,d). Since d = c, D is at (15,c). So vector CA is from C to A: (0-0, 0-c) = (0, -c). Vector CD is from C to D: (15-0, c - c) = (15, 0). The angle between vectors CA (0,-c) and CD (15,0) is 90 degrees, since their dot product is 0*15 + (-c)*0 = 0. But the given angle is 30 degrees. Contradiction again!

This suggests that with AB=15, CD=15, and right angles at A and B, the angle at C cannot be 30 degrees. Hence, there must be an error in the problem or my interpretation.

Wait, but the problem says "Rectangle(A, B, D, C)" as a predicate. Perhaps the rectangle is not a standard rectangle, but a different type? Or perhaps the angle at C is not between A, C, D but another configuration?

Wait, maybe the angle is at C between D, C, A? Wait, the angle is MeasureOf(Angle(A, C, D)), which is angle at C between A, C, D. So that's the angle at C between CA and CD. In the previous setup, this angle is 90 degrees, but the problem says 30 degrees. Hence, contradiction. 

Is there any possibility that the figure is not planar? Unlikely. Or perhaps the angle is reflex? No, angles in geometry problems are typically considered as less than 180 degrees.

At this point, I'm stuck with contradictions arising from the given conditions. Perhaps there's a miscalculation. Let me try once more with different assumptions.

Suppose the rectangle is not ABCD but a different configuration. Let me think about the rectangle's properties. A rectangle has opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees. If ABCD is a rectangle, then AB = CD and AD = BC. Given that AB = 15, so CD = 15, which matches the given LengthOf(Line(C, D)) = 15. So that part is consistent.

Also, in a rectangle, diagonals are equal. Diagonals AC and BD are equal. Let me use this. Let me denote AB = CD = 15, and AD = BC = x. Then, the diagonals AC and BD have length sqrt(15² + x²).

Now, the angle at C between A, C, D is 30 degrees. Let me analyze this angle. In a rectangle, the diagonals bisect each other and are equal. The angle between diagonal AC and side CD. In a rectangle, the diagonals divide the angles into two equal parts. Wait, no, in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal but do not necessarily bisect the angles unless it's a square. 

Let me consider triangle ACD. In rectangle ABCD, points A, C, D. AC is a diagonal, CD is a side. The angle at C between AC and CD is what we need. Let me calculate this angle.

Using the law of sines or cosines in triangle ACD. Let me find the lengths. In the rectangle, AC = sqrt(15² + x²), CD = 15, and AD = x. Wait, but in triangle ACD, the sides are AC, CD, and AD? No, triangle ACD has sides AC, CD, and AD? No, points A, C, D: AC is diagonal, CD is side, and AD is another side? Wait, no. Point D is connected to C and A? In rectangle ABCD, point D is connected to C and A. So triangle ACD has sides AC, CD, and AD. Wait, AD is a side of the rectangle, which is x. CD is 15. AC is sqrt(15² + x²). So applying the law of cosines in triangle ACD:

AD² = AC² + CD² - 2 * AC * CD * cos(angle at C).

Wait, no. Law of cosines says:

AD² = AC² + CD² - 2 * AC * CD * cos(angle at C).

Wait, but AD is a side of the rectangle, which is x. AC is diagonal, length sqrt(15² + x²). CD is 15. So:

x² = (15² + x²) + 15² - 2 * sqrt(15² + x²) * 15 * cos(angle at C)

Simplify:

x² = 225 + x² + 225 - 30 * sqrt(225 + x²) * cos(angle at C)

Subtract x² from both sides:

0 = 450 - 30 * sqrt(225 + x²) * cos(angle at C)

Rearranged:

30 * sqrt(225 + x²) * cos(angle at C) = 450

Divide both sides by 30:

sqrt(225 + x²) * cos(angle at C) = 15

Now, we know that the angle at C is 30 degrees. So:

sqrt(225 + x²) * cos(30°) = 15

cos(30°) = √3/2 ≈ 0.866

So:

sqrt(225 + x²) = 15 / (√3/2) = 15 * 2 / √3 = 30 / √3 = 10√3

Square both sides:

225 + x² = (10√3)^2 = 100 * 3 = 300

So x² = 300 - 225 = 75 → x = sqrt(75) = 5√3 ≈ 8.66

Now, the area of the rectangle is AB * AD = 15 * x = 15 * 5√3 = 75√3 ≈ 129.9. This matches option C. 

But earlier, this led to a contradiction with the right angle at A. How is that resolved?

Wait, let's verify if the right angle at A (Angle(BAC)) holds. In this scenario, AB is 15, AD is 5√3, and angle at A between B and C is 90 degrees. Wait, but in a rectangle, all angles are 90 degrees, so angle BAC is part of the rectangle's structure. Wait, in the rectangle, angle at A is between AB and AD, which is 90 degrees. But angle BAC is a different angle, splitting the rectangle. Wait, if AB is one side, and AC is the diagonal, then angle BAC is part of the triangle ABC. Let me calculate it.

In triangle ABC, AB = 15, AC = sqrt(15² + (5√3)^2) = sqrt(225 + 75) = sqrt(300) = 10√3. BC is AD = 5√3. So in triangle ABC, sides AB = 15, BC = 5√3, AC = 10√3. Let's check if angle at A is 90 degrees. By Pythagoras, AB² + BC² should equal AC²? Let's see:

AB² + BC² = 225 + 75 = 300, and AC² = 300. Yes! So triangle ABC is a right triangle at A. Hence, angle BAC is 90 degrees. Wait, but in this case, angle BAC is 90 degrees, but in the triangle ABC, it's the right angle. Wait, no. If AB and BC are the legs, then angle at B is the right angle. Wait, no, in this case, AB and AD are perpendicular, but AC is the hypotenuse. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me clarify.

Point A is connected to B and D. In the rectangle, AB and AD are perpendicular. But AC is the diagonal from A to C. In triangle ABC, points A, B, C. AB is one side, BC is another side of the rectangle, and AC is the diagonal. Wait, in this case, AB = 15, BC = AD = 5√3, and AC = sqrt(15² + (5√3)^2) = sqrt(300). So triangle ABC has sides AB=15, BC=5√3, AC=10√3. Applying Pythagoras: AB² + BC² = 225 + 75 = 300 = AC². So yes, it is a right triangle at B. Wait, but the problem states that angle BAC is a right angle. This suggests that the right angle is at A, but according to this, it's at B. Contradiction again!

Wait, what's the angle BAC? It's the angle at A between B and C. In this case, vectors AB and AC. AB is from A to B (along x-axis), and AC is from A to C (diagonal). Let me calculate this angle using the dot product. 

Vector AB is (15, 0). Vector AC is (15, 5√3)? No, wait. If A is (0,0), B is (15,0), D is (0,5√3), then C is B + vector BC. Wait, in the rectangle, BC is equal to AD, which is 5√3. But direction? In a rectangle, BC is from B to C, which should be equal and parallel to AD. AD is from A(0,0) to D(0,5√3), so vector AD is (0,5√3). Hence, vector BC should be the same. So from B(15,0), adding vector BC = (0,5√3) gives C at (15, 5√3). 

Then, AC is from A(0,0) to C(15,5√3). Vector AC is (15,5√3). Vector AB is (15,0). The angle between AB and AC is angle BAC. Let's calculate it.

Dot product of AB and AC: (15)(15) + (0)(5√3) = 225

|AB| = 15

|AC| = sqrt(15² + (5√3)^2) = sqrt(225 + 75) = sqrt(300) = 10√3

Cos(theta) = 225 / (15 * 10√3) = 225 / (150√3) = 3 / (2√3) = √3/2 ≈ 0.866, which corresponds to 30 degrees. So angle BAC is 30 degrees, not a right angle. But the problem states that RightAngle(Angle(B, A, C)), which is angle BAC is a right angle. This is a contradiction. 

Where is the error? The problem states that angle BAC is a right angle, but according to this setup, it's 30 degrees. This suggests that the given conditions are inconsistent, but since it's a problem from a textbook or similar, there must be a resolution.

Wait, perhaps the rectangle is not ABCD but another configuration. Let me try to redefine the points. Let me assume that ABCD is a rectangle with AB = 15, and angle at C is 30 degrees. But in a rectangle, all angles are 90 degrees. So this is impossible. Hence, the only way this works is if the angle at C is not part of the rectangle but another part of the figure. 

Wait, maybe the figure is not a rectangle but a different quadrilateral, and the predicate Rectangle(A, B, D, C) is incorrect? Or perhaps it's a typo, and it should be Trapezoid or another shape?

Alternatively, perhaps the angle at C is not part of the rectangle but part of a triangle. Let me try to ignore the rectangle predicate and focus on the other conditions. 

Given:

- Right angle at A between B and C (angle BAC = 90°)
- Right angle at B between A and D (angle ABD = 90°)
- Length AB = 15
- Length CD = 15
- Angle at C between A and D is 30°

Let me try to find the area. Assume A at (0,0), B at (15,0), since AB = 15. Since angle BAC is 90°, AC is vertical. Let C be at (0, y). Now, angle ABD is 90°, so BD is vertical from B, so D is at (15, k). Now, CD is from C(0, y) to D(15, k), length 15. So:

sqrt((15-0)^2 + (k - y)^2) = 15 → 225 + (k - y)^2 = 225 → (k - y)^2 = 0 → k = y. So D is at (15, y). 

Now, angle at C between A, C, D is 30°. Points A(0,0), C(0,y), D(15,y). Vectors CA = (0 - 0, 0 - y) = (0, -y), CD = (15 - 0, y - y) = (15, 0). The angle between CA and CD is 90 degrees, since CA is vertical down and CD is horizontal right. But the problem says it's 30 degrees. Contradiction again. 

This suggests that the given conditions are mutually exclusive. However, since the problem provides answer choices, and one of them is 129.9, which is 75√3, and the earlier calculation with the rectangle gave that, despite the contradictions, perhaps the intended answer is C, assuming that the angle at C is part of the rectangle's diagonal and the right angle at A is due to the triangle, even though it conflicts with the rectangle's properties. 

Given that, and since the area comes out to 75√3 ≈ 129.9, which is option C, I'll conclude that the correct answer is C.
