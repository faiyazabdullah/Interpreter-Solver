Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, the question is asking for the measure of angle RST, given that triangle RST is isosceles and that the measure of angle at SRT is 70 degrees. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to recall what an isosceles triangle is. An isosceles triangle has two sides that are equal in length, and the angles opposite those sides are also equal. But wait, the problem mentions the triangle as Triangle(R,S,T). Wait, usually, triangles are named with vertices, so maybe the order matters here? Like, if it's Triangle(R,S,T), does that mean the vertices are R, S, and T? So, the triangle has vertices R, S, and T. 

Now, the first predicate is Isosceles(Triangle(R,S,T)). That means two sides are equal. But which sides? In an isosceles triangle, the equal sides are called the legs, and the unequal side is the base. However, without knowing which sides are equal, I need to figure out based on other information. 

Wait, there's another predicate: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(S,R,T)), 70). Let me parse that. The MeasureOf(Angle(S,R,T)) refers to the angle at vertex R, formed by points S, R, T. Wait, angle notation can sometimes be confusing. The middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(S,R,T) would be the angle at point R between points S and T. So that's angle SRT, which is 70 degrees. 

So we have triangle RST with angle at R being 70 degrees. And the triangle is isosceles. Now, since it's isosceles, two angles are equal. But which ones?

In a triangle, the sum of angles is always 180 degrees. Let me consider the possibilities. Since angle at R is 70 degrees, if the triangle is isosceles, either the two base angles are equal (the ones at S and T) or one of the other angles equals angle R. 

But wait, the triangle's name is RST. So the vertices are R, S, T. So the angles are at each of these vertices. Let me denote them:

Angle at R: ∠R = 70° (given).

Angles at S (∠S) and T (∠T) are unknown. Since the triangle is isosceles, two angles are equal. There are two cases:

Case 1: The two equal angles are at S and T. Then ∠S = ∠T. Since the sum of angles is 180°, then 70 + 2x = 180 → 2x = 110 → x = 55. Therefore, angles at S and T would each be 55°. But the question asks for ∠RST, which is the angle at S. Wait, hold on. Wait, angle RST is the angle at point S, right? Because in angle notation, the middle letter is the vertex. So ∠RST is the angle at S between points R and T. So that would be angle S. So if case 1 holds, where ∠S and ∠T are equal, then ∠S is 55°, which would make the answer 55°, which is option A.

Case 2: Alternatively, maybe the triangle is isosceles with two equal sides. For example, if sides RS and RT are equal, making the base ST. Then the base angles would be at S and T. Wait, but if RS = RT, then the base is ST, and the two equal sides are RS and RT, so the base angles are at S and T. Which again leads us back to Case 1. But if instead, the equal sides were RS and ST, then the base would be RT, and the base angles would be at R and T. But angle at R is already given as 70°, so if angle at T is also 70°, then angle at S would be 180 - 70 -70 = 40°. But then ∠RST is angle at S, which would be 40°, which isn't among the options. Similarly, if the equal sides were RT and ST, then the base angles would be at R and S. So angle at R is 70°, angle at S would also be 70°, making angle at T = 180 - 70 -70 = 40°. Again, ∠RST is angle at S, which would be 70°, which is option B.

Wait, but how do we know which sides are equal? The problem says Isosceles(Triangle(R,S,T)), but doesn't specify which sides are equal. So perhaps there's ambiguity unless more info is given. However, the second predicate gives us angle at R is 70°, which could help determine which case applies.

Alternatively, maybe the triangle is such that the two equal sides are adjacent to the given angle. For example, if angle R is between two equal sides, meaning RS and RT are equal. Then, that would make the triangle isosceles with legs RS=RT, apex at R. Then, the base angles would be at S and T. Hence, angles at S and T are equal. Thus, angle S = angle T = (180 - 70)/2 = 55°, so angle RST (which is angle at S) is 55°, so answer A.

Alternatively, if the equal sides were different. Suppose the triangle is isosceles with legs SR and ST. Then, the apex would be at S, so the base angles would be at R and T. Then angle at R is 70°, so angle at T would also be 70°, leading to angle at S being 180 - 70 -70 = 40°, which is not an option. Or if the equal sides are RT and ST, making the apex at T, so base angles at R and S. Then angle at R is 70°, so angle at S is also 70°, making angle at T = 180 - 70 -70 = 40°, which again gives angle at S as 70°, which is option B.

But how do we determine which scenario is correct? The problem states that the triangle is isosceles, but doesn't specify which sides are equal. However, the given angle is at R, which is part of the triangle. So, depending on which sides are equal, the answer varies.

Wait, but maybe there's a standard way to interpret Isosceles(Triangle(R,S,T))? Typically, when naming a triangle, the order of the letters can indicate the order of the vertices, but not necessarily the sides. However, in some contexts, the triangle is considered as having sides RS, ST, TR. So, if it's isosceles, two of those sides are equal. So, the possibility is that either RS = ST, ST = TR, or TR = RS.

Let me think. If RS = ST, then the triangle has sides RS = ST, making the base RT. Then, the base angles would be at R and T. So angle at R (which is 70°) equals angle at T. Then angle at S would be 180 - 2*70 = 40°, which again gives angle at S as 40°, which isn't an option.

If ST = TR, then sides ST and TR are equal. So the triangle has two equal sides ST and TR, meaning the base is RS. Then the base angles would be at R and S. So angle at R is 70°, so angle at S is also 70°, making angle at T = 180 - 70 -70 = 40°. Thus, angle RST (at S) is 70°, which is option B.

Alternatively, if RS = RT, then sides RS and RT are equal, making the base ST. Then the base angles are at S and T. So angles at S and T are equal. Given angle at R is 70°, so angles at S and T are (180 - 70)/2 = 55°, hence angle at S is 55°, which is option A.

Therefore, the answer depends on which sides are equal. However, the problem statement only tells us that the triangle is isosceles, but doesn't specify which sides. How can we resolve this ambiguity?

Wait, maybe the notation of the triangle's name implies something about the sides. For instance, Triangle(R,S,T) typically lists the vertices in order, so the sides are RS, ST, and TR. So, if the triangle is isosceles, two of these sides are equal. But without further information, we can't directly tell which two. However, the presence of the angle at R being 70° may give a clue. Let me think.

Suppose that the triangle is isosceles with RS = RT (so legs RS and RT are equal), making the apex at R. This would make angles at S and T equal. Hence, angle at S (which is ∠RST) would be 55°, as above. Alternatively, if the triangle is isosceles with RS = ST, then the apex is at S, and angles at R and T are equal. But since angle at R is 70°, angle at T would also be 70°, making angle at S = 40°, which isn't an option. Similarly, if ST = TR, then apex at T, angles at R and S are equal. Angle at R is 70°, so angle at S is 70°, making angle at T = 40°, which would mean angle RST is 70°, which is option B.

But how do we choose between these scenarios? The problem doesn't specify which sides are equal, but maybe there's an implied convention. In some textbooks, the order of the letters in the triangle name might imply the order of the vertices, but not necessarily the sides. However, if we assume that the triangle is isosceles with the two equal sides being the ones that are adjacent to the given angle, that is, if angle at R is between two equal sides, then RS and RT are equal, leading to the base angles at S and T being equal. That seems like a plausible assumption because often problems mention angles in relation to the sides they're between. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to look at it. Since the problem gives the measure of angle at R (SRT) as 70°, and asks for angle RST (which is at S), perhaps the triangle is such that angle R is the unique angle, and the other two are equal. That would mean angle R is the unique one, and the other two are equal. So, in that case, angles at S and T are equal, leading to angle S being 55°, which is option A. 

But why would angle R be the unique one? Well, if the triangle is isosceles, it can have either two equal angles or all three equal (equilateral). But since one angle is given as 70°, which isn't 60°, it's not equilateral. So, if angle R is unique, then the other two angles are equal. So that would make angles at S and T equal, each being 55°, making angle RST (angle at S) equal to 55°, so answer A.

However, there's another possibility: if the triangle is isosceles with two equal angles at R and S, making angle R and angle S equal. But angle R is given as 70°, so angle S would also be 70°, making angle T = 180 - 70 -70 = 40°, which would mean angle RST (angle at S) is 70°, which is option B. But how do we know whether the two equal angles are at R and S or at S and T?

This seems ambiguous. But perhaps the problem assumes that the triangle is isosceles with the two equal sides being the ones that form the given angle. Wait, but that's not a standard assumption. However, in many geometry problems, when an isosceles triangle is mentioned without specifying which sides are equal, it's common to infer based on the given angles. For example, if an angle is given, and the triangle is isosceles, it's often assumed that the given angle is the unique one, and the others are equal. 

But I'm not sure. Another way to check is to see if both options are present in the answer choices. Here, options A and B are present. So which one is correct?

Wait, maybe the problem uses the notation where the triangle is written as Triangle(R,S,T), implying that the sides are RS, ST, TR. So if the triangle is isosceles, then two of these sides are equal. Let me think about the implications:

Case 1: RS = ST. Then, the triangle has sides RS = ST, so the apex is at S. Then, the base angles would be at R and T. So angles at R and T are equal. Given that angle at R is 70°, angle at T is also 70°, so angle at S is 180 - 70 -70 = 40°, which is not an option.

Case 2: ST = TR. Then, the sides ST and TR are equal, making the apex at T. The base angles would be at R and S. So angle at R is 70°, angle at S is also 70°, making angle at T = 180 - 70 -70 = 40°, so angle at S (which is ∠RST) is 70°, which is option B.

Case 3: RS = RT. Then, the sides RS and RT are equal, making the apex at R. The base angles would be at S and T. So angles at S and T are equal. Given angle at R is 70°, so angles at S and T are (180 - 70)/2 = 55°, so angle at S (which is ∠RST) is 55°, which is option A.

So the answer depends on which sides are equal. Without more information, it's ambiguous. However, in many standardized tests, when an isosceles triangle is presented with an angle given, and the question asks for another angle, it's customary to assume that the given angle is the unique one, and the other two are equal. Therefore, in this case, angle R is 70°, which is unique, so angles at S and T are equal. Hence, angle RST (at S) is 55°, so answer A.

Alternatively, if the triangle is isosceles with sides RS = RT, then angle at R is the vertex angle, and the base angles at S and T are equal. That fits with the given angle being the vertex angle. Therefore, leading to answer A.

Another way to verify: suppose the answer was B (70°). That would imply that angle at S is 70°, making the triangle have two angles of 70°, which would mean the third angle is 40°, which is possible. But in that case, the triangle would be isosceles with sides RT = ST (since angles at R and S are equal). But in that case, the sides opposite those angles would be equal. So angle at R (70°) is opposite side ST, and angle at S (70°) is opposite side RT. Therefore, ST = RT, making the triangle isosceles with ST = RT. So that's valid.

But how do we decide which scenario is intended? Maybe the problem expects the student to recognize that in an isosceles triangle, the two equal angles are the ones that are not specified, so if angle R is given, the other two are equal. But that's not necessarily true. It depends on which sides are equal.

Wait, but the problem didn't specify which sides are equal. However, in the absence of additional information, perhaps we need to consider the most straightforward interpretation. Since the triangle is named R-S-T, and angle at R is given, it's possible that the triangle is isosceles with the two equal sides being RS and RT (adjacent to angle R), making the base ST. Therefore, the base angles at S and T are equal. Hence, leading to angle RST being 55°, which is option A.

Alternatively, if the problem considers the triangle to have sides RS and ST equal, then angle at R and T would be equal. But since angle at R is given as 70°, angle at T would be 70°, and angle at S would be 40°, which isn't an option. So that scenario is invalid. Similarly, if sides ST and TR are equal, then angles at R and S are equal, leading to angle at S being 70°, which is option B.

Therefore, there are two possible interpretations, leading to answers A or B. But since both options are present, how do we choose?

Perhaps the key lies in the notation of the angle. The angle given is MeasureOf(Angle(S,R,T)), which is the angle at R between points S and T. So, this is angle SRT, which is at vertex R. So, the angle at R is 70°, and the triangle is isosceles. Now, if the triangle is isosceles with sides RS and RT equal, then the base angles at S and T are equal, leading to angle at S being 55°, which is option A. 

But if the triangle is isosceles with sides RS and ST equal, then the base angles at R and T are equal. But since angle at R is 70°, angle at T is also 70°, making angle at S = 40°, which is not an option. Hence, this scenario is invalid. 

Similarly, if the triangle is isosceles with sides ST and TR equal, then angles at R and S are equal. So angle at R is 70°, angle at S is 70°, making angle at T = 40°, which is allowed. Hence, angle RST (at S) is 70°, which is option B.

But why would the triangle be isosceles with sides ST and TR equal? That would mean sides ST and TR are equal, so the triangle has two equal sides ST and TR. Therefore, the apex is at T, making the base angles at R and S equal. Hence, angle at R (70°) equals angle at S (70°), making angle at T = 40°. 

So both scenarios A and B are possible, but only if the sides are equal in certain ways. However, since the answer choices include both A and B, and the problem didn't specify which sides are equal, how do we determine which one is correct?

Maybe there's a standard convention. In many math problems, when you're given a triangle with vertices labeled in order, like ABC, and told it's isosceles, it's often assumed that the two equal sides are the ones that are adjacent to the given angle. For example, if angle B is given, then AB and BC might be equal. However, this is not a strict rule, but often used in textbook problems.

Alternatively, the problem may expect the student to realize that since the triangle is isosceles and one angle is given, the other angles depend on which sides are equal. However, without additional information, it's ambiguous. But since both options A and B are present, and the problem requires selecting one, perhaps there's an implicit assumption.

Wait, looking at the answer choices: A. 55, B. 70, C. 75, D. 80. If the given angle is 70°, and the triangle is isosceles, then the other angles could be 55° or 70°, depending on which sides are equal. But if the triangle is isosceles with the given angle being the unique one, then the other two are equal (55°). If the given angle is one of the equal ones, then the third angle is 40°, which isn't an option. Hence, the only viable options are A or B. 

But how to choose between A and B? Perhaps the problem assumes that the triangle is isosceles with the given angle being the vertex angle. In that case, the two base angles are equal. Hence, leading to answer A. Alternatively, if the given angle is one of the base angles, then the other base angle is 70°, leading to answer B.

But without knowing which angle is the vertex, we can't be sure. However, since the problem gives the angle at R as 70°, and asks for angle RST (at S), which is a different angle. If we assume that the triangle is isosceles with the two equal angles being at S and T, then angle at S is 55°, which is option A. If the triangle is isosceles with angles at R and S being equal, then angle at S is 70°, option B.

Given that the problem includes both options, but in most cases, the given angle is considered the unique one, leading to answer A. However, some sources suggest that in an isosceles triangle, the two equal angles are the ones that are not specified, so if one angle is given, the other two are equal. Hence, leading to answer A.

Therefore, I think the intended answer is A. 55°, corresponding to option A.
