Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. So, the question is asking for the measure of angle K in a trapezoid J-K-L-M. Let me start by recalling what I know about trapezoids and the given predicates.

First, the problem states that Trapezoid(J,K,L,M) is true, so we're dealing with a trapezoid with vertices J, K, L, M. Then it says Isosceles(Trapezoid(J,K,L,M)), which means this is an isosceles trapezoid. In an isosceles trapezoid, the non-parallel sides are congruent, and the base angles are equal. Also, the legs (the non-parallel sides) are equal in length.

Next, there's a RightAngle(Angle(M)). Wait, Angle(M) refers to angle at point M? Or maybe angle formed by some lines meeting at M? Hmm, since it's a trapezoid, the points are connected in order. So the trapezoid has sides JK, KL, LM, and MJ. So angle at M would be angle between LM and MJ. But the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(M)), so that angle is 90 degrees. That suggests that one of the angles in the trapezoid is a right angle.

Then, the lengths: Equals(LengthOf(Line(J,K)),6) and Equals(LengthOf(Line(L,M)),6). So side JK is 6 units long, and side LM is also 6 units. Since it's an isosceles trapezoid, the legs (non-parallel sides) should be equal. Wait, but in an isosceles trapezoid, the legs are the non-parallel sides. However, if both JK and LM are 6, perhaps they are the legs?

Wait, let me clarify the structure of the trapezoid. In a trapezoid, two sides are parallel. In an isosceles trapezoid, those two bases are parallel, and the legs are the other two sides, which are congruent. Now, depending on how the trapezoid is labeled, the order of the letters matters. Typically, trapezoid J-K-L-M implies that sides JK, KL, LM, and MJ are consecutive sides. Therefore, the two bases would be JK and LM if they are parallel. Alternatively, if the trapezoid is labeled such that J and K are adjacent, then the bases could be JL and KM, but that's less likely. Wait, need to think carefully.

In standard labeling, a trapezoid ABCD would have AB and CD as the two bases (parallel sides), and AD and BC as the legs. So applying that here, if the trapezoid is J-K-L-M, then the bases would be JK and LM if they are parallel, making the legs KL and JM. But wait, the given lengths are JK = 6 and LM = 6. So if JK and LM are the bases, then they are the two parallel sides. But in an isosceles trapezoid, the legs are congruent. But here, the legs would be KL and JM. But the problem doesn't mention anything about their lengths directly. However, the problem does state that it's an isosceles trapezoid, so the legs KL and JM should be congruent.

But there's another piece of information: RightAngle(Angle(M)). So angle at point M is a right angle. That means that at vertex M, the angle between LM and MJ is 90 degrees. So if angle at M is 90°, that suggests that sides LM and MJ are perpendicular. Therefore, LM is perpendicular to MJ, implying that LM is one leg of the trapezoid, and MJ is the other leg? Wait, no. Wait, if angle at M is between LM and MJ. So LM is one base? Or a leg?

Let me try to sketch mentally. Suppose the trapezoid has bases JK and LM, which are parallel. Then the legs would be KL and JM. If angle at M is a right angle, then the leg JM is perpendicular to the base LM. Because angle between LM (a base) and JM (a leg) is 90°, making JM perpendicular to LM. Similarly, in an isosceles trapezoid, the legs are congruent and the base angles are equal. But if one of the legs is perpendicular to the base, then that would make it a rectangle? Wait, no. Wait, if one of the legs is perpendicular to the base, then the trapezoid becomes a right trapezoid. But since it's also isosceles, that might mean that it's a rectangle. Wait, but rectangles are parallelograms with all angles 90°, but isosceles trapezoid usually isn't a rectangle unless it's a rectangle. However, maybe there's a contradiction here.

Alternatively, perhaps the trapezoid is not having JK and LM as the bases. Maybe the bases are JL and KM? Wait, but the labels are J-K-L-M. So the sides are JK, KL, LM, MJ. So if it's an isosceles trapezoid, then the two bases are either JK and LM, or KL and MJ. But since it's isosceles, the legs are the non-parallel sides.

Given that angle at M is a right angle, which is between LM and MJ. So LM and MJ meet at M, forming a right angle. If LM is a base, then MJ is a leg. If LM is a leg, then MJ is another leg. But in an isosceles trapezoid, legs are congruent and non-parallel. So suppose LM is a leg, then MJ would be the other leg, and they are congruent. But if angle at M is 90°, then that would imply that LM is perpendicular to MJ. Which would make the trapezoid have two right angles? Wait, but in general, a trapezoid can have two right angles if it's a rectangle or a right trapezoid. But since it's isosceles, perhaps only one of the legs is perpendicular, but then the other angles would adjust accordingly.

Wait, but in an isosceles trapezoid, the base angles are equal. So if one of the angles is 90°, then its adjacent angle would also be 90°, making it a rectangle. But that contradicts the fact that it's an isosceles trapezoid. Unless... Wait, maybe the right angle is at a different position. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the bases are KL and JM, and the legs are JK and LM. But then the given lengths are JK=6 and LM=6, which would be the legs. Then, since it's isosceles, legs are equal, which they are (both 6). Then, the right angle at M would be between LM and MJ. If LM is a leg (from L to M), and MJ is a base (since bases are KL and JM?), then angle at M between LM and MJ would be between leg LM and base MJ. If that angle is 90°, then that would make LM perpendicular to MJ. So that would make the trapezoid a right trapezoid with one right angle. But since it's isosceles, maybe there's symmetry. 

Wait, but in an isosceles trapezoid, the legs are congruent and the base angles are equal. If one of the base angles is 90°, then the adjacent base angle would also be 90°, leading to two right angles. Wait, but in that case, the trapezoid would actually be a rectangle. But since it's called an isosceles trapezoid, which typically requires only one pair of sides being parallel. Wait, no—trapezoid is defined as a quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides. An isosceles trapezoid specifically has exactly one pair of parallel sides (the bases), and the legs are congruent. So if it has two right angles, then it would be a rectangle, which is a type of trapezoid, but in that case, all angles are 90°, making it a rectangle. However, the problem mentions it's an isosceles trapezoid, which may or may not exclude rectangles. But the presence of a right angle might indicate it's a right trapezoid, which has two right angles. But if it's also isosceles, that would require more constraints.

Hmm, this seems conflicting. Let me try to approach this step by step.

First, given that it's an isosceles trapezoid, so it has one pair of parallel sides (bases), and the legs are congruent. The given lengths are JK=6 and LM=6. If these are the legs, then they are congruent, which fits with the isosceles property. So assuming that JK and LM are the legs, then the bases are KL and MJ. But then the right angle is at M, which is part of the base MJ. Wait, angle at M is between LM (a leg) and MJ (a base). If that angle is 90°, then LM is perpendicular to MJ. So that would make the trapezoid a right trapezoid, with one leg perpendicular to the base. But since it's isosceles, the other leg (JK) should also be congruent and symmetric. However, in a right trapezoid with one leg perpendicular, the other leg is not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, but if it's isosceles, then maybe the other angles adjust accordingly.

Alternatively, maybe the bases are JK and LM. So JK is one base, LM is the other base, and the legs are KL and MJ. Given that JK=6 and LM=6, so both bases are equal in length. If the bases are equal, then the trapezoid would be a parallelogram, because in a trapezoid with both bases equal and legs congruent, it would be a parallelogram. But a parallelogram can't be isosceles unless it's a rectangle. Wait, but if both bases are equal and the legs are congruent, then it's a parallelogram. But then the angles would be supplementary. But if there's a right angle, then all angles would be right angles, making it a rectangle. But the problem says it's an isosceles trapezoid. So maybe that's not the case.

This is getting confusing. Let me try to draw coordinates to model this.

Let me assign coordinates to the trapezoid. Let me assume that the trapezoid has bases JK and LM, with JK=6 and LM=6. Wait, but if both bases are equal, then it's a parallelogram. But since it's an isosceles trapezoid, which typically has unequal bases. So maybe my assumption is wrong. Therefore, the bases cannot be JK and LM. Hence, the bases must be KL and MJ. Then the legs are JK and LM, each of length 6. Since it's an isosceles trapezoid, legs JK and LM are congruent, which they are. Now, the right angle is at M. So angle at M is between LM (a leg) and MJ (a base). So LM is perpendicular to MJ. Thus, LM is vertical if MJ is horizontal, or vice versa.

So imagine the trapezoid with bases KL and MJ. Let me place point M at the origin (0,0). Since angle at M is a right angle, then MJ is along the x-axis from M(0,0) to J(a,0), and LM is along the y-axis from M(0,0) up to L(0,b). Since LM has length 6, then the length of LM is b = 6. So point L is at (0,6).

Now, since the trapezoid has bases KL and MJ. The other base is KL. Since it's an isosceles trapezoid, the legs JK and LM are congruent. We already have LM=6, so JK must also be 6. Now, point J is at (a,0). Point K is somewhere. Since KL is the other base, which is parallel to MJ. Since MJ is horizontal (along x-axis), KL must also be horizontal. So point K must be horizontally aligned with point L. Wait, point L is at (0,6), and KL is the base. So point K would be at some coordinate (c,6), since KL is horizontal. Then, connecting K to L(0,6) and to J(a,0). Wait, but the leg JK connects J(a,0) to K(c,6). The length of JK is 6. So distance between J(a,0) and K(c,6) is sqrt[(c-a)^2 + (6-0)^2] = sqrt[(c-a)^2 + 36]. This equals 6. Therefore:

sqrt[(c-a)^2 + 36] = 6 → (c-a)^2 + 36 = 36 → (c-a)^2 = 0 → c = a. So point K is at (a,6). Therefore, the base KL goes from K(a,6) to L(0,6). So KL has length |a - 0| = a. And MJ is from M(0,0) to J(a,0), so its length is a. Since the trapezoid is isosceles, the bases are KL and MJ, which are both length a. So this would make it a parallelogram, since both pairs of opposite sides are equal and parallel. But an isosceles trapezoid is supposed to have only one pair of parallel sides. Wait, but if both pairs are parallel, it's a parallelogram. So this suggests that the trapezoid is actually a parallelogram. But in that case, all angles would be determined by the slopes. However, there's a right angle at M, so angle at M is 90°, which would make all angles 90°, hence a rectangle. But then the legs JK and LM would be equal to the bases, which would make it a square or rectangle. But the problem states it's an isosceles trapezoid, which usually implies it's not a parallelogram. So something's wrong here.

Ah, here's the mistake: if both bases are KL and MJ, and they are both length a, then the figure is a parallelogram. But since it's an isosceles trapezoid, which traditionally has only one pair of parallel sides, this suggests that my initial assumption is incorrect. Therefore, the bases cannot be KL and MJ. So maybe the bases are JK and LM, even though they are both length 6. But that would make them equal, leading to a parallelogram again. So this is confusing.

Alternative approach: Let's consider that the trapezoid is not a parallelogram, so only one pair of sides is parallel. Given that, and that it's isosceles. For an isosceles trapezoid, the legs are congruent and the base angles are equal. Also, the legs are non-parallel sides. So if the trapezoid has bases JK and LM (parallel), then the legs are KL and MJ. Given that, and that the legs KL and MJ are congruent. But in this scenario, the given lengths are JK=6 and LM=6. So bases are both length 6, making it a parallelogram again. Contradiction.

Therefore, perhaps the given lengths are not the bases. Let me re-examine the problem statement: Equals(LengthOf(Line(J,K)),6) and Equals(LengthOf(Line(L,M)),6). So Line(J,K) is side JK, and Line(L,M) is side LM. So JK and LM are both 6. If these are the legs, then the bases would be KL and MJ. But earlier that led to a parallelogram. So unless the trapezoid is degenerate, but that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe the trapezoid is right-angled at M, so that LM is perpendicular to MJ. So LM is a leg, and MJ is a base. Then, since it's isosceles, the other leg (KL) must be congruent to LM. But KL is connected between K and L. Let me try assigning coordinates again.

Let me place point M at (0,0). Since angle at M is a right angle, and LM is a leg of length 6, then point L is at (0,6) (assuming LM is vertical). Then MJ is horizontal from M(0,0) to J(a,0). Since LM is vertical, length LM is 6. Now, the other leg is KL. Since it's an isosceles trapezoid, KL should be congruent to LM, so KL=6. Point K is connected to L(0,6) and to J(a,0). Wait, no. The trapezoid is J-K-L-M. So the order is J connected to K, K connected to L, L connected to M, M connected to J. So the sides are JK, KL, LM, MJ. So if LM is from L to M, and MJ is from M to J. So the other leg is KL, which connects K to L. Wait, but KL is a side, not a leg. The legs are the non-parallel sides. So if JK and LM are the legs, then they are the non-parallel sides. Wait, but if JK is a leg, and LM is a leg, then the bases are KL and MJ. 

So in this setup, KL and MJ are the bases (parallel sides). Then, the legs are JK and LM. Given that, and that JK=6 and LM=6. So legs are both length 6. Now, since angle at M is a right angle, which is between LM (leg) and MJ (base). So LM is perpendicular to MJ, meaning that LM is perpendicular to base MJ. Therefore, the height of the trapezoid is LM=6. 

Since it's an isosceles trapezoid, the legs are congruent and the base angles are equal. The base angles at M and J would be equal. But angle at M is 90°, so angle at J would also be 90°, making it a rectangle? No, because the other base angles would be at K and L. Wait, in an isosceles trapezoid, the base angles are equal. If one base is MJ (which is horizontal) and the other base is KL (which is parallel to MJ), then the base angles at M and J are adjacent to base MJ, while the base angles at K and L are adjacent to base KL. 

But if angle at M is 90°, then angle at J should be equal to it, making it 90°, which would imply that the trapezoid is a rectangle. But then all angles would be 90°, making it a rectangle. But the problem states it's an isosceles trapezoid. However, a rectangle is technically an isosceles trapezoid because it has two pairs of parallel sides, but often isosceles trapezoid is considered to have exactly one pair. This depends on the definition. Some sources define trapezoid as having exactly one pair of parallel sides, in which case a rectangle wouldn't qualify. Others define it as at least one pair, allowing rectangles. 

Assuming that the problem allows for rectangles, then the trapezoid would be a rectangle, and all angles are 90°, so angle K would be 90°, which is not among the options except D. But option D is 180, which doesn't make sense. Wait, the options are A.6, B.60, C.100, D.180. Wait, none of these are 90. So that suggests that my previous assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the trapezoid is not a rectangle. Perhaps only one of the base angles is 90°, but due to the isosceles property, there's a conflict. Let me reconsider. If the trapezoid has one right angle at M, and it's isosceles, then the other angles must adjust. Let's say the bases are KL and MJ. Then, since it's isosceles, the legs are JK and LM. The right angle at M is between leg LM and base MJ. So LM is perpendicular to MJ, making LM the height of the trapezoid. The other leg JK is congruent to LM, so JK=6. 

Now, since the trapezoid is isosceles, the base angles at K and L are equal. Let me denote the angles. At point M, angle is 90°. At point J, the angle is adjacent to base MJ and leg JK. In an isosceles trapezoid, the base angles at M and J are equal. Wait, no—the base angles are at the ends of the bases. So if the bases are KL and MJ, then the base angles at K and L are adjacent to base KL, and the base angles at M and J are adjacent to base MJ. Since it's isosceles, the base angles at M and J are equal. Given that angle at M is 90°, angle at J is also 90°, which again leads to a rectangle. But again, the options don't have 90°. So this is problematic.

Perhaps I made an error in identifying which sides are the bases. Let me try another configuration. What if the bases are JK and LM, and the legs are KL and MJ. Given that, and since it's an isosceles trapezoid, legs KL and MJ are congruent. Given that, and the given lengths are JK=6 and LM=6. So bases are both length 6, making it a parallelogram. Again, leading to a rectangle. Still not matching the answer choices.

Wait, maybe the given lengths aren't the bases. Perhaps JK and LM are the legs. Let me think. If JK and LM are legs, then they are congruent (as per isosceles trapezoid). Given that, and the right angle at M. Let me try to visualize this. Assume trapezoid J-K-L-M, with legs JK and LM. So sides JK and LM are the legs, and the bases are KL and MJ. Now, the right angle at M is between LM (a leg) and MJ (a base). So LM is perpendicular to MJ. Hence, LM is the height of the trapezoid. Since LM=6, the height is 6. 

Now, since it's an isosceles trapezoid, the legs are congruent, so JK=LM=6. Now, to find angle K. Angle K is at point K, which is connected to J and L. Since the bases are KL and MJ, and the legs are JK and LM. In this configuration, angle K is one of the base angles at base KL. In an isosceles trapezoid, base angles are equal. So angle at K and angle at L are equal. Also, the sum of consecutive angles is 180°, since the bases are parallel. 

We know that angle at M is 90°, and since it's a trapezoid with bases KL and MJ, the angle at J is supplementary to angle at M. So angle at J is 90°, making it a rectangle again. But again, this leads to all angles being 90°, which conflicts with the answer choices.

Alternatively, perhaps the right angle is not at the base, but at the leg. Wait, the predicate is RightAngle(Angle(M)), so it's angle at M. If angle at M is between LM and MJ, and that's a right angle, but if LM is a leg, and MJ is a base, then that's the same as before. 

Maybe there's another way. Let's use the properties of isosceles trapezoid and right angles. In an isosceles trapezoid, the diagonals are congruent. Also, the base angles are equal. Suppose that angle at M is 90°, and it's an isosceles trapezoid. Let me try to calculate the angles. 

Suppose the trapezoid has bases AB and CD, with AB || CD, and legs AD and BC. In an isosceles trapezoid, angles at A and B are equal, and angles at D and C are equal. Also, angle A + angle D = 180°. 

Applying this to our trapezoid J-K-L-M. Let's say the bases are KL and JM, with KL || JM. Then the legs are JK and LM. Given that angle at M is 90°, which is between leg LM and base JM. So angle at M is between LM and JM. In this case, angle at M is adjacent to base JM and leg LM. Since it's an isosceles trapezoid, angle at J should be equal to angle at M. So angle at J is also 90°, making it a rectangle. Again, leading to all angles being 90°, which is not in the answer choices.

Wait, but the options are 6, 60, 100, 180. None of these are 90. So perhaps my entire approach is wrong. Maybe the right angle is not at the base, but at a different location. Let me check the predicate again: RightAngle(Angle(M)). So angle at M is a right angle. So in the trapezoid J-K-L-M, point M is one of the vertices. Let me try to think of the trapezoid where angle at M is 90°, but it's not a rectangle. How is that possible?

For example, imagine a right trapezoid where only one of the angles is 90°, and it's isosceles. Wait, but in an isosceles trapezoid, the legs are congruent and the base angles are equal. If one of the base angles is 90°, then the adjacent base angle would also be 90°, making it a rectangle. So this suggests that it's impossible for an isosceles trapezoid to have just one right angle. Hence, the problem must involve a different configuration.

Wait, perhaps the trapezoid is not convex? Or maybe the right angle is at a different point. Wait, the problem states RightAngle(Angle(M)), so it's definitely angle at M. Let me think differently. Let's forget about the bases and focus on the given data.

Given that it's an isosceles trapezoid, so legs are congruent. The legs are the non-parallel sides. Given that, and that JK=6 and LM=6. If these are the legs, then they are congruent, satisfying the isosceles condition. Now, the right angle is at M, which is between LM and MJ. So LM is a leg, and MJ is a base. Hence, LM is perpendicular to MJ. So the height of the trapezoid is LM=6. 

Now, since it's an isosceles trapezoid, the base angles at M and J are equal. But angle at M is 90°, so angle at J is also 90°. This would mean that the trapezoid has two right angles, making it a rectangle, but then all angles are 90°, which again conflicts with the answer choices. 

Wait, but maybe the trapezoid is not a rectangle because the other angles are not right angles. How is that possible? If it's isosceles, and one of the base angles is 90°, then the adjacent base angle would also be 90°, making it a rectangle. So this suggests that the only possibility is a rectangle, but the answer choices don't include 90°. This indicates that there's a misunderstanding in the identification of which sides are the bases and legs.

Let me try one last time. Perhaps the given lengths are the bases. So JK=6 and LM=6 are the bases, and the legs are KL and MJ. Since it's an isosceles trapezoid, the legs are congruent. So KL=MJ. Now, the right angle at M is between LM and MJ. So angle at M is between base LM and leg MJ. Since LM is a base, and MJ is a leg, which is perpendicular to LM. So the leg MJ is perpendicular to base LM, making it a right trapezoid. In this case, since it's isosceles, the other leg KL should be congruent to MJ. 

Let me try to compute the angles. In this case, the trapezoid has bases JK and LM (both length 6), and legs KL and MJ. Since it's a right trapezoid, one of the legs (MJ) is perpendicular to the base LM. Let me assign coordinates again. Let me set point M at (0,0). Since LM is a base of length 6, and MJ is perpendicular to it, let's assume LM is horizontal. So point L is at (6,0), and MJ is vertical upwards from M(0,0) to J(0,a). The length of MJ is a, which is equal to KL (since it's an isosceles trapezoid). Now, point K is connected to J and L. Since KL is the other leg, which has length a. Point K is connected to L(6,0) and J(0,a). So the distance between K and L is a. Let me find coordinates of K. 

Point K is connected to L(6,0) and J(0,a). Let me assume that the trapezoid is isosceles, so the legs KL and MJ are congruent. Since MJ is length a, KL is also length a. The coordinates of K can be found such that distance from K to L(6,0) is a, and distance from K to J(0,a) is also a? No, KL is a single leg, so distance from K to L is a. Wait, KL is a side, which is a leg, so yes. 

Let me denote point K as (x,y). Distance from K(x,y) to L(6,0) is a: √[(x-6)^2 + (y-0)^2] = a. Distance from K(x,y) to J(0,a) is the other leg, which is KL. Wait, no, KL is a single side, so it's from K to L. The other leg is MJ, from M to J, which is length a. Since it's an isosceles trapezoid, the legs are KL and MJ, both length a. So KL = MJ = a. 

Also, since the trapezoid has bases JK and LM. Wait, JK is from J(0,a) to K(x,y), and LM is from L(6,0) to M(0,0). But the length of JK is given as 6. So distance from J(0,a) to K(x,y) is 6: √[(x-0)^2 + (y-a)^2] = 6. 

So now we have two equations:

1. From KL: √[(x-6)^2 + y^2] = a
2. From JK: √[x^2 + (y - a)^2] = 6
And also, since MJ is length a, and MJ is from M(0,0) to J(0,a), so a is the length of MJ.

Additionally, since the trapezoid has bases JK and LM. Wait, but JK is from J to K, which is a diagonal, not a base. Wait, no, the bases are the two parallel sides. Earlier assumption was that bases are JK and LM. Are they parallel? For that, the slope of JK should equal the slope of LM. 

Slope of LM: from L(6,0) to M(0,0): slope is (0-0)/(0-6) = 0, so horizontal line. So slope of LM is 0. Slope of JK: from J(0,a) to K(x,y): (y - a)/(x - 0) = (y-a)/x. For JK to be parallel to LM, slope must be 0, so (y-a)/x = 0 → y = a. So y-coordinate of K is a. 

Substituting y = a into equation 2: √[x^2 + (a - a)^2] = √(x²) = |x| = 6 → x = ±6. But since the trapezoid is J-K-L-M, and L is at (6,0), and M is at (0,0), point K should be positioned such that KL connects to L(6,0). If x=6, then point K is (6, a). Then distance from K(6,a) to L(6,0) is |a - 0| = a, which matches the first equation. So a = a, which holds. 

So point K is (6, a). Now, what about point J? It's at (0,a), and point K is at (6,a). So segment JK is from (0,a) to (6,a), which is horizontal, length 6, matching the given LengthOf(Line(J,K))=6. 

Now, the other base is LM, from L(6,0) to M(0,0), which is length 6, as given. So both bases are length 6, and the legs are KL and MJ. KL is from K(6,a) to L(6,0), which is vertical, length a. MJ is from M(0,0) to J(0,a), also vertical, length a. So this makes the trapezoid a rectangle! All angles are 90°, since all sides are perpendicular. But again, this leads to all angles being 90°, which isn't in the answer choices. 

But the problem states it's an isosceles trapezoid, and here it's a rectangle. So perhaps the answer is 90°, but since it's not an option, there's a mistake in the assumptions. 

Wait, looking back at the answer choices: D is 180. That's a straight angle. Could angle K be a straight angle? That would mean that points J, K, L are colinear, making the trapezoid degenerate. But that's unlikely. 

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the question. The question asks for m∠K. In the scenario where it's a rectangle, all angles are 90°, so angle K is 90°, but this isn't an option. So what's going on? 

Wait, let me check the original problem again. The given predicates are:

- Trapezoid(J,K,L,M)
- Isosceles(Trapezoid(J,K,L,M))
- RightAngle(Angle(M))
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(J,K)),6)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(L,M)),6)

Wait, the second predicate is Isosceles(Trapezoid(...)), which means it's an isosceles trapezoid. The third is RightAngle(Angle(M)), so angle at M is 90°. The fourth and fifth give lengths of JK and LM as 6. 

But in the scenario where it's a rectangle, all angles are 90°, including angle K. But since 90° is not an option, perhaps the problem assumes a different configuration. Let me think: what if the trapezoid is not a rectangle, but has one right angle and is isosceles? How?

Maybe the right angle is at M, and the trapezoid is not a rectangle, but the other angles are not right angles. Let's try to derive this. 

Assume the trapezoid has bases KL and MJ, with KL || MJ. Legs are JK and LM. Given that, and it's isosceles, so legs JK and LM are congruent. Given that, and angle at M is 90°, so angle between LM and MJ is 90°. Let me use coordinates again. 

Let me place M at (0,0). Since angle at M is 90°, and LM is a leg, let me assume LM is vertical, so point L is at (0,6) (since LM=6). Then MJ is horizontal from M(0,0) to J(a,0). Now, since it's an isosceles trapezoid, the other leg JK should be congruent to LM, so JK=6. Point J is at (a,0), and point K is connected to J and L. 

To find coordinates of K, since KL is the other base, which is parallel to MJ. Since MJ is horizontal, KL must also be horizontal. So point K must be at (b,6), since it's connected to L(0,6) and needs to form a horizontal base KL. Wait, if KL is horizontal, then point K must be at (c,6), and point L is at (0,6). So KL has length |c - 0| = c. 

Now, the leg JK connects J(a,0) to K(c,6), and has length 6. So distance between J(a,0) and K(c,6) is √[(c - a)^2 + (6 - 0)^2] = √[(c - a)^2 + 36] = 6. Squaring both sides: (c - a)^2 + 36 = 36 → (c - a)^2 = 0 → c = a. So point K is at (a,6). Therefore, KL is from K(a,6) to L(0,6), which has length a. And MJ is from M(0,0) to J(a,0), length a. So this makes it a parallelogram, since both bases are length a and parallel, and legs are congruent. Hence, it's a parallelogram, which is a special case of an isosceles trapezoid? Or is it not? Depends on the definition. 

If it's a parallelogram, then it's also a rectangle if all angles are 90°. But here, angle at M is 90°, so if it's a parallelogram, then all angles are 90°, making it a rectangle. But again, angle K is 90°, not in the options. 

This suggests that there's a contradiction, which implies that my understanding of the problem is missing something. Let me revisit the original predicates. 

Wait, the given lengths are Line(J,K) and Line(L,M). In the previous scenarios, these were bases or legs. But what if Line(J,K) is a leg, and Line(L,M) is a base? Let me try that. 

Assume that in the trapezoid, the bases are KL and JM, and the legs are JK and LM. Given that, and that JK=6 and LM=6. So legs are both 6. Now, angle at M is 90°, which is between LM (leg) and MJ (base). So LM is perpendicular to MJ. 

Let me assign coordinates again. Place M at (0,0). Since LM is a leg of length 6 and perpendicular to MJ, let's say LM is vertical, so L is at (0,6). MJ is horizontal from M(0,0) to J(a,0). Now, since it's an isosceles trapezoid, the other leg JK is also 6. Point J is at (a,0), and point K is connected to J and L. 

Since the bases are KL and MJ, which are parallel. MJ is horizontal, so KL must also be horizontal. Point L is at (0,6), so point K must be at (b,6) to make KL horizontal. The distance from K(b,6) to L(0,6) is |b - 0| = |b|. 

Now, the leg JK connects J(a,0) to K(b,6), and has length 6. So distance between J(a,0) and K(b,6) is √[(b - a)^2 + (6 - 0)^2] = √[(b - a)^2 + 36] = 6. Squaring gives (b - a)^2 + 36 = 36 → (b - a)^2 = 0 → b = a. So point K is at (a,6). Thus, KL is from K(a,6) to L(0,6), length a, and MJ is from M(0,0) to J(a,0), length a. So again, it's a parallelogram, making it a rectangle if angle at M is 90°. 

This seems to consistently lead to a rectangle, which is not matching the answer choices. This suggests that there might be an error in the problem, or perhaps I'm missing a key insight. 

Wait, maybe the trapezoid is not convex? Or maybe the right angle is at a different part. Let me consider that angle at M is between LM and MJ, but LM is a base and MJ is a leg. Wait, but in that case, it's a right angle at M between base LM and leg MJ, making it a right trapezoid. Let me try this.

Assume bases are LM and KJ, and legs are MK and JL. Wait, but the trapezoid is J-K-L-M. So the sides are JK, KL, LM, MJ. If bases are LM and KJ, then they are parallel. Let me try to find the angles. 

Given that angle at M is 90°, which is between LM and MJ. So LM is a base, and MJ is a leg. If LM and KJ are parallel, then the other base KJ is parallel to LM. Let me assign coordinates again. Let me set M at (0,0). Since LM is a base, let me assume it's horizontal. Let me say point L is at (6,0), so LM has length 6. Then, since LM is a base, and KJ is parallel to it. Point J is connected to M, and K is connected to J. 

Since it's an isosceles trapezoid, the legs are MK and JL. Given that it's isosceles, legs MK and JL are congruent. Also, the right angle at M is between LM (base) and MJ (leg). So MJ is perpendicular to LM, making MJ vertical. So point J is at (0, b), since MJ is vertical from M(0,0) to J(0,b). 

Now, since KJ is parallel to LM, which is horizontal. So KJ must also be horizontal. Point J is at (0,b), and point K is connected to J and L. Let me find coordinates of K. Since KJ is horizontal, and J is at (0,b), then K must be at (c,b). Now, point L is at (6,0), and point K is at (c,b). The side KL connects K(c,b) to L(6,0). 

Since it's an isosceles trapezoid, the legs are MK and JL. MK is from M(0,0) to K(c,b), and JL is from J(0,b) to L(6,0). These legs should be congruent. So length of MK is √[(c-0)^2 + (b-0)^2] = √(c² + b²). Length of JL is √[(6-0)^2 + (0-b)^2] = √(36 + b²). For these to be equal: √(c² + b²) = √(36 + b²) → c² + b² = 36 + b² → c² = 36 → c = ±6. 

Assuming c is positive, c=6. So point K is at (6,b). Now, the base KJ is from K(6,b) to J(0,b), which is horizontal, length 6. This matches the given LengthOf(Line(J,K))=6. 

Now, the other base is LM, from L(6,0) to M(0,0), length 6, which matches the given LengthOf(Line(L,M))=6. 

Now, the trapezoid has bases LM and KJ, both length 6, and legs MK and JL, both length √(36 + b²). Since it's an isosceles trapezoid, this is satisfied. Now, what about the right angle at M? Angle at M is between LM (from M(0,0) to L(6,0)) and MJ (from M(0,0) to J(0,b)). This is indeed a right angle, since LM is horizontal and MJ is vertical. 

Now, we need to find m∠K. Point K is at (6,b). The angle at K is between sides JK and KL. 

Side JK is from J(0,b) to K(6,b), which is horizontal. Side KL is from K(6,b) to L(6,0), which is vertical. So angle at K is between horizontal and vertical lines, which is 90°. But again, this makes it a rectangle, all angles 90°, which is not an option. 

Wait, but in this case, the trapez
