MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. Hmm, so we need to find the value of x based on the given angle measures and some point-line relationships. Let me start by going through each predicate carefully.

First, the given predicates involve several angles at point D. The points mentioned are H, D, C; B, D, C; G, D, C; E, D, C; E, D, A; and some points lying on lines. Also, there are expressions with variables x, y, z. 

Let me list out the angle measures again:

- Measure of Angle HDC = 7x + 9
- Measure of Angle BDC = z
- Measure of Angle GDC = 7y - 4
- Measure of Angle EDC = 11x - 1
- Measure of Angle EDA = 2y + 5

Also, points A, C, F lie on certain lines related to D. Specifically:

- A lies on line DE
- C lies on line DG
- F lies on line DB

So maybe these points form some lines connected to D? Like, if I imagine point D connected to various other points. Maybe there's a diagram where D is a common vertex, and lines like DE, DG, DB, DC are extending from it?

Since angles are given around point D, perhaps they are adjacent angles forming a larger angle or something. Wait, angles at D... So if multiple lines come out of D, those angles could be parts of a full rotation around D, which sums up to 360 degrees. But maybe they're part of a straight line or intersecting lines?

Alternatively, since points A, C, F are on different lines from D, maybe there are multiple lines emanating from D, creating several angles. For example, lines DA, DC, DG, DB, DF, etc., but the exact configuration isn't given. However, the angles mentioned involve points like E, B, G, H, etc. Let me think about how these angles relate.

Looking at the angles:

Angle HDC: Points H, D, C. So angle at D between HD and DC.

Similarly, Angle BDC: angle at D between BD and DC.

Angle GDC: angle at D between GD and DC.

Angle EDC: angle at D between ED and DC.

Angle EDA: angle at D between ED and DA.

Wait, so points E, B, G, H are connected to D via lines. Since A is on line DE, then DA is part of line DE. Similarly, C is on line DG, so DC is part of line DG. And F is on line DB, so DF is part of line DB.

Therefore, point D has several lines coming out: DE, DG, DB, maybe others. So, angles around D would be formed between these lines. For instance, angles involving DC and other lines.

But how do these angles relate? Let me consider that all these angles might be adjacent and sum up to something. For example, if multiple angles meet at D, their total measure could add up to 360 degrees. Or maybe some of them are supplementary or vertical angles?

Alternatively, maybe there's a transversal or parallel lines involved. But without knowing the exact diagram, I have to rely on the given angle expressions and relations.

Another thought: since points A, C, F are on lines DE, DG, DB respectively, then lines DA, DC, DF, DG, etc., might form angles around D. Let me see if there are any vertical angles or linear pairs.

For example, angle EDA is between ED and DA. Since A is on DE, then DA is along DE. Therefore, angle EDA would actually be zero because ED and DA are colinear. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no—if A is on line DE, then DA is part of line DE. So angle EDA would be the angle between ED and DA, but since both are along the same line, that angle should be 0°, unless there's another line. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation.

Wait, the angle notation is written as Angle(E, D, A). That means the angle at point D between points E and A. So, the angle is ∠EDA, with vertex at D, sides going to E and A. Since A lies on line DE, then points E, D, A are colinear. So the angle between ED and DA would be a straight line, making that angle 180°, but that contradicts the given expression 2y + 5. Therefore, my assumption must be wrong here. Perhaps A is not on line DE extended beyond D? Wait, the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(D, E)). So A is somewhere on the line that connects D and E. So if D-E-A are colinear, then angle EDA would be a straight angle if A is on the extension of ED beyond D. Wait, but that would mean that angle EDA is 180°, but according to the predicate, it's 2y + 5. So maybe A is between D and E? Then, the angle EDA would be zero? No, that also doesn't make sense. There's confusion here.

Wait, maybe the angle EDA refers to the angle at D between E and A. If A is on line DE, then depending on the position of A relative to D and E, the angle could vary. Suppose A is on the line DE such that D is between E and A. Then, the angle between ED and DA would be a straight line, so 180°, which again conflicts with the given expression. Alternatively, if A is on line DE such that E-D-A, then angle EDA would be zero, but again conflicting. This suggests that maybe there's more than just line DE, but other lines. Wait, perhaps the line DE is extended beyond E to point A? Wait, but the predicate states PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(D, E)), so A could be anywhere on line DE, including between D and E, or beyond either end.

This seems confusing. Let me re-examine the angle expressions. The angle EDA is given as 2y + 5. So that angle is non-zero, implying that points E, D, A are not colinear. But according to the predicate, A is on line DE. So this contradiction implies that my interpretation is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the notation for the angle is different. In standard notation, Angle(E, D, A) means the angle at D between points E and A. So the angle is formed by segments DE and DA. If A is on line DE, then DA is a segment from D to A, which is along line DE. So if A is on line DE, then DA is a subset of line DE, making angle EDA a straight line, hence 180°, which again conflicts with the given expression. Unless A is not on line DE but on another line? Wait, the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(D, E)), so A is definitely on line DE. This is perplexing.

Wait, perhaps the angle EDA is not between ED and DA, but between ED and something else? Wait no, the angle is at D, so the two sides are DE and DA. If A is on line DE, then DA is along DE, making the angle undefined or 180°, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my understanding of the notation.

Wait, maybe the angle EDA is referring to a different configuration. For example, if there's another line connected to D besides DE, maybe DA is not on line DE. Wait, but the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(D, E)), which means A is on line DE. So DA is part of line DE. Hence, angle EDA would be 0° or 180°, which conflicts with the given measure of 2y + 5. Therefore, there must be a miscalculation here. Maybe the angle is not at D? Wait, the notation Angle(E, D, A) is supposed to be the angle at D. So, this is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe there's a typo in the problem, or perhaps I misread the angle names. Let me check again. The fifth predicate is Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(E, D, A)), 2y + 5). So yes, angle at D between E and A. Given that A is on line DE, this seems contradictory. Unless the line DE is extended beyond E to A, making A not on the segment DE but on its extension. Wait, but even then, DA would be a ray starting at D and passing through E and A, so angle EDA would still be a straight angle. So, this suggests that there's an error in the problem setup, but since this is a math problem, likely I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the points are arranged differently. Maybe there are multiple lines from D, and A is not on line DE but on another line? Wait, the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(D, E)), so that's fixed. Alternatively, maybe the angle is not formed by ED and DA but by another pair of lines. Wait, no—the angle is at D, so the sides are DE and DA. If A is on line DE, then DA is along DE. Thus, angle EDA would be 180°, which cannot be expressed as 2y + 5. Therefore, this suggests that there's an inconsistency unless A is not on line DE but on a different line. But the problem states that A lies on line DE. This is very confusing.

Maybe I need to proceed despite this confusion, assuming that the angle is meant to be something else. Alternatively, perhaps the angle is not between ED and DA but between EA and something else? Wait, no. The angle notation is Angle(E, D, A), which is unambiguous—vertex at D, with sides going to E and A. 

Hmm. This is a critical issue. Without resolving this, I can't proceed. Let me think differently. Perhaps the diagram has multiple lines from D, and A is on one line, while other points are on other lines. For example, suppose D is the origin, with lines DA, DB, DC, DE, DG extending from it. Then, the angles between these lines would be measured. For example, angle EDA is between ED and DA, which would require that DA and ED are two different rays from D. But if A is on line DE, then DA is part of line DE. So, unless DA is a different line, which it's not. Therefore, this suggests that the given information may have an error, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the notation.

Alternatively, maybe the angle is not between ED and DA but between ED and something else. Wait, no. Let me try to visualize: if D is connected to E and A, with A on line DE, then angle EDA is the angle between ED and DA, which are colinear, leading to 180°. But the problem gives it as 2y + 5, which is a variable. Therefore, this suggests that my assumption about the position of A is incorrect. Perhaps the line DE is not a straight line but something else? No, lines are straight by definition.

Wait, maybe the angle is not between ED and DA, but between ED and another line? No, the angle is specified as EDA, so it must be between ED and DA. 

At this point, I might have to assume that there's a typo or misinterpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the angle is not at D but at another point? No, the middle letter is D, so it's at D. 

Given that this is a problem from a textbook or exam, perhaps the key is to realize that angle EDA is part of a triangle or something else. Let me try to ignore this contradiction for a moment and proceed with the other angles.

Other angles involve point D with other points. For example, angles HDC, BDC, GDC, EDC. These seem to be angles at D between different lines. Let's assume that these angles are adjacent and form a full circle around D. So, the sum of all angles around D would be 360 degrees. 

Let me list all the angles mentioned:

- Angle HDC (between HD and DC): 7x + 9
- Angle BDC (between BD and DC): z
- Angle GDC (between GD and DC): 7y - 4
- Angle EDC (between ED and DC): 11x - 1
- Angle EDA (between ED and DA): 2y + 5

Wait, but these angles might overlap or be parts of larger angles. For example, if multiple lines pass through D, the angles between each pair of lines would contribute to the total. 

Alternatively, maybe some of these angles are vertical angles or supplementary. For instance, if two lines cross at D, creating opposite angles. But without knowing the exact diagram, it's challenging.

However, considering that points A, C, F are on lines DE, DG, DB respectively, maybe there are several lines from D: DA, DB, DC, DE, DG, DF. Each of these lines creates angles with each other. 

Assuming that, the angles around D would be the sum of all these angles. However, since angles can be adjacent or overlapping, it's hard to tell. But let's try to consider the angles that involve DC. 

For example, angles HDC, BDC, GDC, EDC all involve DC. So maybe these angles are adjacent around point D, adding up to the total around D. But how?

Suppose that from point D, there are multiple lines: let's say lines DH, DB, DG, DE, and DC. Then, the angles between these lines would be:

Between DC and DH: angle HDC (7x+9)

Between DC and DB: angle BDC (z)

Between DC and DG: angle GDC (7y-4)

Between DC and DE: angle EDC (11x-1)

But wait, there's also angle EDA (2y+5). How does that fit in?

Alternatively, if DA is another line from D, then angle between ED and DA would be angle EDA. If DA is a separate line from DE, then angle EDA would be between ED and DA. So if DA is not on line DE, then this angle makes sense. But earlier, the predicate said A lies on line DE, which would imply DA is on DE. This contradiction remains unresolved.

Perhaps the key is that there are multiple lines from D, and A is on line DE, but DA is not the same as DE. Wait, no—if A is on line DE, then DA is a segment from D to A, which is part of line DE. So, unless A is at D itself, which would make DA zero length. But that's not possible. 

This suggests that there's a fundamental flaw in the problem setup, but since it's presented as solvable, I must be missing something. Let me try to look at other angles and see if there's a way to relate them.

We have two expressions with variables x and y: 7x +9, 11x -1, 7y -4, 2y +5. Also, z appears in angle BDC. Maybe there are equations we can derive by considering that certain angles are supplementary or complementary.

For instance, if two angles form a linear pair, their sum is 180°. Suppose that angles EDC and EDA are adjacent and form a straight line. If angle EDC is between ED and DC, and angle EDA is between ED and DA, then if DA and DC are on opposite sides of ED, their sum would be 180°. 

Wait, let's explore this possibility. Assume that DA and DC are on opposite sides of line ED. Then, angle EDC (between ED and DC) plus angle EDA (between ED and DA) would equal the angle between DC and DA, which would be a straight line if they are opposite. But that might not necessarily be true. 

Alternatively, if DA and DC are on the same side of ED, then the sum of angles EDA and EDC would be the angle between DA and DC. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's difficult. However, if we assume that angles EDA and EDC are adjacent and form a straight angle (since A is on line DE), then their sum would be 180°. 

Wait, let's try that. If angle EDA is between ED and DA, and angle EDC is between ED and DC, and if DA and DC are on opposite sides of ED, then angle EDA + angle EDC = 180°. 

So substituting the expressions:

(2y + 5) + (11x -1) = 180  
=> 2y + 5 + 11x -1 = 180  
=> 11x + 2y +4 = 180  
=> 11x + 2y = 176 ...(Equation 1)

Now, looking at other angles. What about angle HDC and angle EDC? If they are adjacent, forming a larger angle. But without knowing the configuration, it's tricky. 

Alternatively, considering that points H, B, G are on lines connected to D, and C is on line DG. So, line DG passes through D and C. So, angle GDC is between GD and DC, which would be 0° if G, D, C are colinear. But the measure is given as 7y -4, so that suggests that GD and DC are not colinear. Wait, but the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(D, G)), which means C is on line DG. So DC is a part of line DG. Hence, angle GDC is between GD and DC, which are colinear, making the angle 0°, but the given measure is 7y -4. Contradiction again! 

Ah, here's another contradiction. If C lies on line DG, then DC is part of line DG. So angle GDC would be the angle between GD and DC, which are the same line, hence 0°. But the measure is given as 7y -4. This implies that my understanding is incorrect. Perhaps the angle is not between GD and DC but between GD and another line? Wait, the angle is Angle(G, D, C), which is the angle at D between G and C. If C is on line DG, then GD and DC are the same line, making the angle undefined or zero. This suggests that there's a misinterpretation of the angle notation.

Wait, maybe the angle is not between GD and DC but between GC and something else? No, the notation Angle(G, D, C) means the angle at D between G and C. So, if C is on line DG, then the angle between DG and DC would be zero. Hence, the measure 7y -4 must be zero, giving 7y -4 = 0 => y=4/7. But this seems unlikely, and it's unclear how that fits with other equations.

This suggests that there's a fundamental error in interpreting the angle notations, possibly due to mislabeling or misreading the points. Given that this is a problem designed to have a solution, I must adjust my assumptions.

Let me try to consider that the points are arranged such that multiple lines radiate from D, and the angles mentioned are between different lines. For example, if D is the center of a star-like shape with several lines extending out, creating various angles around it.

Assuming that, the sum of all angles around point D should be 360 degrees. Let's attempt to identify all the angles contributing to this sum.

From the given angles:

- Angle HDC (between HD and DC): 7x +9
- Angle BDC (between BD and DC): z
- Angle GDC (between GD and DC): 7y -4
- Angle EDC (between ED and DC): 11x -1
- Angle EDA (between ED and DA): 2y +5

Additionally, there might be other angles not explicitly mentioned, such as those between other lines. But given the limited information, let's focus on what's given.

If we consider that all these angles are part of the full 360-degree circle around D, but they might overlap or be parts of larger angles. Alternatively, some of them might be supplementary or part of triangles.

Another approach: if we consider that angles involving DC are adjacent. For example, if lines HB, BG, etc., form various angles with DC. But without seeing the diagram, it's challenging.

Alternatively, focusing on the angles that involve DC. Let's consider that line DC is common to several angles. For instance, angle HDC, BDC, GDC, and EDC all share DC as one side. So, if we imagine DC as a reference line, the other sides of these angles are HD, BD, GD, and ED. 

Thus, the angles between HD and DC, BD and DC, GD and DC, ED and DC would be adjacent around DC. But since these are angles at D, not at C, this might not directly apply.

Wait, but if we consider that these angles are all on one side of DC, their sum would be the total angle around D on that side. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's still ambiguous.

However, if we assume that these four angles (HDC, BDC, GDC, EDC) are adjacent and form a full circle around D, their sum would be 360 degrees. Let me try that:

Sum of angles at D: (7x +9) + z + (7y -4) + (11x -1) = 360

Simplify: 
7x +9 + z +7y -4 +11x -1 = 360  
Combine like terms: (7x +11x) + (9 -4 -1) + z +7y = 360  
18x +4 + z +7y = 360  
So, 18x +7y +z = 356 ...(Equation 2)

But we have three variables here: x, y, z. Need more equations.

Another equation comes from angle EDA (2y +5). Assuming that this angle relates to other angles. Earlier, I considered that angle EDA and EDC might be supplementary. Let's revisit that idea. If angle EDA is between ED and DA, and angle EDC is between ED and DC, and if DA and DC are on opposite sides of ED, then their sum would be 180°, as they form a straight line.

So, 2y +5 + 11x -1 = 180  
Which simplifies to 11x + 2y +4 = 180  
As before: 11x + 2y = 176 ...(Equation 1)

Now, with Equation 1 and Equation 2, we need another relation to connect these variables. Perhaps angle BDC (z) relates to other angles. 

If there's another relationship involving z. For example, if lines BD and something else form a straight line, making z supplementary to another angle. But without knowing the diagram, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, if there's a triangle involved where z is an angle. For instance, if there's a triangle BDC, but we don't know enough about it. 

Wait, let's think about the points. Point F lies on line DB. So, line DB extends from D to B, and F is somewhere on it. If there's a triangle involving F, but again, not sure.

Alternatively, considering that angle HDC is 7x +9 and angle EDC is 11x -1. If these two angles are part of a larger structure, like a triangle or a transversal. 

Alternatively, if lines HD and ED are related. But without more info, this is speculative.

Wait, perhaps there's another equation from angle HDC and angle EDC. If they are adjacent, forming a larger angle. For example, if HD and ED are on opposite sides of DC, then angle HDC + angle EDC = angle HDE. But again, without knowing the diagram, it's guesswork.

Alternatively, if there's a triangle with angles involving x and y. For example, if triangle HDC has angles that sum to 180°, but we don't know the other angles.

This is getting too vague. Let's go back to Equation 1 and 2. We have:

Equation 1: 11x + 2y = 176  
Equation 2: 18x +7y + z = 356  

Need a third equation. Where could it come from?

Maybe angle GDC (7y -4) relates to something. If line DG is extended, and there's a straight line, making it supplementary to another angle. For example, if GD and something else form a straight line, making 7y -4 + ... = 180.

But again, without knowing the diagram, it's hard. Another possibility: if there's a triangle where angle GDC is part of it. For instance, if there's a triangle DGC, but we don't have info about other angles.

Wait, maybe there's another relation from angle EDA. Earlier, I assumed it was supplementary to EDC, leading to Equation 1. Let's stick with that for now.

Now, with Equation 1 and 2, we need another equation. Let's think about the other angle involving y, which is angle EDA = 2y +5. Is there a way to link this with angle GDC = 7y -4? 

Suppose that angle EDA and angle GDC are related. For example, if they are vertical angles or supplementary. But without knowing their positions, it's hard. Alternatively, if they are part of a straight line. 

Alternatively, if there's a triangle where these angles are parts of. 

Alternatively, if there's a transversal creating alternate interior angles, but again, lacking diagram details.

Wait, maybe there's a relation between angles involving z. Since z is the measure of angle BDC, and point F lies on line DB. If there's a triangle involving BDC, but without more data...

Alternatively, if there's a triangle where z is an exterior angle. For example, if z is an exterior angle to another triangle, making it equal to the sum of remote interior angles. But again, speculation.

At this point, I might need to make an assumption to proceed. Let's suppose that angle BDC (z) is supplementary to another angle. For example, if line BF is extended, making z and another angle supplementary. But without knowing, this is risky.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a relation between angles involving x and y. For example, from Equation 1: 11x + 2y = 176. Let's express y in terms of x: 2y = 176 -11x → y = (176 -11x)/2.

Substituting this into Equation 2: 18x +7y +z = 356. But we still have z as an unknown. 

Unless there's another equation involving z. Let me think: if there's a triangle where z is an angle, and other angles can be expressed in terms of x and y. For example, if triangle BDC has angles z and other angles related to other expressions.

But without knowing the triangle's other angles, this is not helpful. 

Wait, perhaps the angles involving y are connected. For example, angle EDA = 2y +5 and angle GDC =7y -4. If these angles are supplementary, then 2y +5 +7y -4 = 180 → 9y +1 = 180 → 9y = 179 → y ≈ 19.89. But this is arbitrary.

Alternatively, if they are equal: 2y +5 =7y -4 → 5 +4 =7y -2y → 9=5y → y=9/5=1.8. Plugging into Equation 1: 11x + 2*(9/5)=176 → 11x + 18/5 = 176 → 11x = 176 - 18/5 = (880 -18)/5 = 862/5 → x = 862/(5*11) = 862/55 ≈ 15.67. Not matching any answer choices. 

This suggests that this assumption is incorrect. 

Another idea: if angle GDC and angle HDC are supplementary. So, (7y -4) + (7x +9) = 180 → 7x +7y +5 = 180 → 7x +7y = 175 → x + y = 25. 

With this, we have from Equation 1: 11x +2y = 176  
And x + y =25 → y =25 -x. Substituting into Equation 1: 11x +2*(25 -x) =176 → 11x +50 -2x =176 → 9x = 126 → x =14. 

This gives x=14, which is option D. Let me verify this.

If x=14, then from x + y =25 → y=25 -14=11.

Check Equation 1: 11x +2y = 11*14 +2*11 = 154 +22=176, which matches. 

Then, from Equation 2: 18x +7y +z =356. With x=14, y=11: 18*14 +7*11 +z = 252 +77 +z = 329 +z = 356 → z=356-329=27. 

So z=27. Now, is there any reason why z=27? It depends on whether our assumption about the supplementary angles is valid. 

Why did we assume that angle GDC and HDC are supplementary? Because if lines HG and something else form a straight line, making those angles supplementary. But without knowing the diagram, this is an assumption. However, since this leads to a consistent result that matches one of the answer choices (D:14), it might be the intended path.

Let me check if this makes sense. If angle HDC (7x +9) and angle GDC (7y -4) are supplementary, then their sum is 180°. 

With x=14 and y=11: 

7x +9 =7*14 +9 =98 +9=107  
7y -4=7*11 -4=77-4=73  
Sum:107+73=180. Yes, that works! 

So this assumption holds. Why are these angles supplementary? It might be that lines HG and something else are straight, making those two angles form a linear pair. For example, if HD and GD are on opposite sides of DC, forming a straight line, thus making angles HDC and GDC supplementary. 

This seems plausible. Therefore, the assumption leads us to x=14, which is option D. 

Let me confirm with other equations. From Equation 1, we had 11x +2y=176, which with x=14 and y=11 gives 154 +22=176. Correct. 

So, the answer would be D:14.
