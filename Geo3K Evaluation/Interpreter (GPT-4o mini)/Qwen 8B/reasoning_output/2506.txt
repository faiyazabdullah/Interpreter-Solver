Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. 

So, we have a parallelogram J K L M. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in length and opposite angles are equal. Also, consecutive angles are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. Additionally, the diagonals bisect each other. But wait, the problem mentions points J, K, L, M forming a parallelogram. Let me recall the properties again.

Given that it's a parallelogram, so JKLM has opposite sides equal. So, JK equals LM, and KL equals JM. Wait, but looking at the given lengths: LengthOf(Line(J, M)) is 3a, and LengthOf(Line(J, K)) is 2b + 3. Also, LengthOf(Line(K, L)) is 21, and LengthOf(Line(M, L)) is 45. Hmm. Wait, in a parallelogram, adjacent sides are not necessarily equal unless it's a rhombus. So, maybe I should check which sides are opposite?

In a parallelogram, the order of the letters matters. So, the vertices are connected as J-K-L-M-J? Or maybe J-K-L-M arranged such that sides are JK, KL, LM, MJ. So, opposite sides would be JK and LM, KL and MJ. Therefore, JK = LM and KL = MJ. 

Wait, the problem says Parallelogram(J, K, L, M). So, the order is J connected to K, K to L, L to M, M back to J. So, sides are JK, KL, LM, MJ. Then opposite sides are JK and LM, KL and MJ. Therefore, JK equals LM, and KL equals MJ. 

Looking at the given lengths: LengthOf(Line(J, M)) is 3a. That's the diagonal? Wait, no. Line(J, M) is one of the sides? Wait, no. Wait, in the parallelogram, the sides are JK, KL, LM, MJ. So, Line(J,M) would be a diagonal connecting J to M. Because in a parallelogram, the diagonals connect opposite corners. Wait, but if the points are ordered J-K-L-M, then the diagonals are JL and KM. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify.

Let me draw mentally the parallelogram J-K-L-M. So, starting at J, then K, then L, then M, then back to J. So the sides are JK, KL, LM, and MJ. Therefore, the diagonals would be JL and KM. So, the diagonals are connecting J to L and K to M. However, the given line segments are JM and others. Wait, Line(J, M) is a side? No, because in the parallelogram, the sides are JK, KL, LM, MJ. So, JM would be a diagonal, since J is connected to M via the diagonal. Wait, no. Wait, if you go from J to K to L to M, then J is connected to M through the side JM? Wait, no. If it's a parallelogram, then the sides are JK, KL, LM, and MJ. Therefore, JM is a diagonal. Wait, but in a parallelogram, the opposite sides are equal. So, JK equals LM, and KL equals MJ. Wait, KL is one of the sides, and MJ is another. So, KL = MJ. 

But according to the given data, LengthOf(Line(K, L)) is 21. That's KL. And LengthOf(Line(M, L)) is 45. Wait, Line(M, L) would be LM. Wait, LM is a side of the parallelogram. Since LM is opposite to JK, so LM equals JK. Wait, but LM is given as 45? Wait, no. Let me recheck.

Wait, the given LengthOf(Line(K, L)) is 21. So that's KL. Then LengthOf(Line(M, L)) is 45. That's LM. So, in the parallelogram, KL and LM are adjacent sides. Wait, but KL and LM are adjacent sides? Wait, KL is from K to L, LM is from L to M. So yes, they are adjacent sides meeting at point L. Therefore, KL and LM are two adjacent sides of the parallelogram. But in a parallelogram, adjacent sides can be different lengths. However, the problem states that JKLM is a parallelogram, so opposite sides are equal. Therefore, JK equals LM, and KL equals MJ. 

So, KL is 21, so MJ is also 21. And LM is 45, so JK is also 45. Wait, but the problem gives LengthOf(Line(J, K)) as 2b + 3. Which is JK. So, JK equals LM, which is 45. Therefore, 2b + 3 = 45. Solving for b, that would give 2b = 42 → b=21. But maybe that's not directly needed yet. 

Also, LengthOf(Line(J, M)) is 3a. Now, Line(J, M) is a diagonal of the parallelogram. Because in a parallelogram, the diagonals are JL and KM. Wait, but JM is not a diagonal. Wait, if the points are J-K-L-M, then the diagonals are J to L and K to M. Wait, but Line(J, M) connects J to M. Is that a diagonal? Let me think. If the parallelogram is J-K-L-M, then the vertices are connected as J-K, K-L, L-M, M-J. So, J is connected to K and M. Wait, no. Wait, in a parallelogram, each vertex is connected to two adjacent vertices. So, J is connected to K and M. So, JM is a side? Wait, no. Wait, if you have J connected to K and M? Wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe my initial assumption about the order of the points is wrong. Maybe the parallelogram is J-K-L-M connected in order, making the sides J-K, K-L, L-M, and M-J. Therefore, J is connected to K and M. So, JM is a side? No, because J is connected to K and M. Wait, then JM would be a side? Wait, that can't be. Because in a parallelogram, each vertex has two adjacent sides. For example, J is connected to K and M, so sides JK and JM. Then, K is connected to J and L, etc. Wait, but then the sides would be JK, KL, LM, and MJ. Therefore, JM is a side? Wait, no. Wait, if J is connected to K and M, then the sides are JK and JM. Then, the other sides are KL and LM. So, the sides are JK, KL, LM, MJ. Therefore, JM is not a side; it's a diagonal. Wait, no. Wait, if you have J connected to M, then that's a diagonal. Wait, but in a parallelogram, the sides are adjacent vertices. So, J is connected to K and M? That would mean that J has two adjacent sides, JK and JM. Therefore, the sides are JK, KL, LM, and MJ. So, JM is a side? No, because MJ is a side. So, JM is the same as MJ, just reversed. So, the length of JM is equal to the length of KL? Wait, earlier conclusion was that opposite sides are equal. So, JK equals LM, and KL equals MJ. Therefore, KL is 21, so MJ is 21. And LM is 45, so JK is 45. 

Therefore, the given LengthOf(Line(J, M)) is 3a. But Line(J, M) is the same as MJ, which is a side. Wait, but earlier we said that MJ is equal to KL, which is 21. Therefore, 3a = 21, so a = 7. But the problem says that LengthOf(Line(J, K)) is 2b + 3, which is JK. And since JK equals LM, which is 45, then 2b + 3 = 45 → 2b = 42 → b = 21. But maybe that's not directly helpful yet. 

Now, moving on to the angles. The problem gives MeasureOf(Angle(L, R, M)) = 30°, and MeasureOf(Angle(M, R, K)) = 70°. Wait, these angles involve point R, which isn't mentioned in the parallelogram. So, there's a point R somewhere, creating those angles. 

Angle(L, R, M) means the angle at point R between points L and M. Similarly, Angle(M, R, K) is the angle at R between M and K. So, point R is outside the parallelogram, and forms two angles with points L, M, K. 

So, perhaps triangle LRM and/or triangle MRK are involved. Let me try to visualize. Points L and M are part of the parallelogram. Point R is such that ∠L-R-M is 30°, and ∠M-R-K is 70°. So, maybe R lies somewhere such that lines RL and RM form a 30° angle, and lines RM and RK form a 70° angle. 

But how does this relate to the parallelogram? Perhaps R is a point where some lines intersect, or maybe it's constructed in relation to the parallelogram. Alternatively, maybe R is a point where certain diagonals meet? Not sure yet. 

Alternatively, maybe triangle formed by R, L, M and R, M, K are connected. Let me consider the sum of angles around point R. The angles given are ∠LRM = 30°, and ∠MRK = 70°. If these angles are adjacent, then maybe they form a larger angle? But without knowing the configuration, it's hard to tell. However, considering that R is connected to L, M, and K, maybe there's a straight line or something. 

Alternatively, maybe R is located such that lines RL and RK form angles with RM. But this seems too vague. 

Alternatively, perhaps R is a point where the diagonals intersect? Wait, but in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. But if R were the intersection of diagonals, then the angles would depend on the shape. However, the given angles are 30° and 70°, which don't immediately suggest anything. 

Alternatively, maybe R is a point outside the parallelogram, forming triangles with sides of the parallelogram. 

Another thought: since we need to find m∠KJL, which is the angle at point J between points K and L. Wait, angle KJL is the angle at J between K and L. In the parallelogram, angle at J is between sides JK and JM. Wait, no. Wait, in a parallelogram, each angle is determined by two adjacent sides. At point J, the sides are JK and JM. Wait, but if the parallelogram is J-K-L-M, then the angle at J is between sides JK and JM. However, the angle KJL refers to the angle at J between K and L. Wait, but L is not directly connected to J. Wait, point L is connected to K and M. So, point J is connected to K and M. So, the angle KJL would require point L being connected to J? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, angle KJL is the angle at point J between points K and L. Wait, but point L is not directly connected to J. So, this suggests that lines are extended or something? 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me clarify. The angle KJL is the angle at point J, with segments JK and JL. Wait, but JL is a diagonal of the parallelogram. Because in a parallelogram, the diagonals are JL and KM. So, angle KJL is the angle at J between side JK and diagonal JL. 

Ah! So, angle KJL is formed by side JK and diagonal JL. Therefore, to find this angle, we might need to use properties of parallelograms involving diagonals. 

Alternatively, since we know some sides and angles involving point R, maybe there's a way to relate them. 

But first, let's focus on the given angles. Let me note down:

MeasureOf(Angle(L, R, M)) = 30°, which is ∠LRM = 30°, and MeasureOf(Angle(M, R, K)) = 70°, which is ∠MRK = 70°. 

Assuming that these angles are at point R, then the sum of angles around R could be considered. However, since we have two angles given, maybe there's a triangle involved. 

For instance, if we consider triangle RKM, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if R is connected to L, M, and K, then maybe triangle RML and triangle RKM. 

Alternatively, since ∠LRM = 30° and ∠MRK = 70°, if points L, M, K are connected through R, then perhaps the total angle at R is 30° + 70° = 100°, assuming that those angles are adjacent. 

But how does that help us? Well, maybe we can find some relationship between the sides or use the Law of Sines or Cosines in some triangles. 

But first, let me think about the parallelogram itself. We know sides JK = 45 (since LM = 45), KL = 21, and JM = 21 (since KL = MJ). Wait, earlier conclusion that JM is equal to KL? Yes, because in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. So, KL and MJ are opposite sides, hence equal. So, KL = MJ = 21. And JK and LM are opposite sides, so JK = LM = 45. 

But the problem says that LengthOf(Line(J, K)) is 2b + 3. So, JK = 2b + 3 = 45. Hence, 2b + 3 = 45 → 2b = 42 → b = 21. 

Similarly, LengthOf(Line(J, M)) is 3a. But Line(J, M) is the same as MJ, which is 21. Therefore, 3a = 21 → a = 7. 

So, we have found that a = 7 and b = 21. But how does this help with finding angle KJL? 

Angle KJL is the angle at J between points K and L. As discussed earlier, this is the angle between side JK and diagonal JL. To find this angle, we might need to use the law of cosines in triangle JKL or something similar. Wait, but triangle JKL? Let me see. 

Wait, in the parallelogram, points J, K, L, M. So, J is connected to K and M. L is connected to K and M. Diagonal JL connects J to L. So, triangle JKL includes points J, K, and L. Let me check: points J, K, L. So, sides JK = 45, KL = 21, and JL. 

To find angle at J in triangle JKL, we can use the Law of Cosines. But for that, we need the length of JL. 

Alternatively, in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, but they aren't necessarily equal unless it's a rectangle. However, the diagonals can be calculated using the formula for a parallelogram: the sum of squares of the diagonals equals twice the sum of squares of the sides. 

Wait, the formula is: |JL|² + |KM|² = 2(|JK|² + |KL|²). 

We know JK = 45, KL = 21. So, substituting:

|JL|² + |KM|² = 2*(45² + 21²). 

But we don't know either diagonal. However, if we can find one diagonal, we can compute the other. But how? 

Alternatively, maybe we can find the length of diagonal JL using coordinates. Let me try setting up coordinate axes. 

Let me assign coordinates to the parallelogram. Let me place point J at the origin (0,0). Since it's a parallelogram, vector JK and vector JM define the shape. Let me assume coordinates:

Let’s denote vectors. Let’s say point J is at (0,0). Let’s suppose that vector JK is along the x-axis. So, point K is at (45, 0), since JK = 45. Now, since it's a parallelogram, vector JM is such that ML equals JK. Wait, but I need to define point M. 

Alternatively, since KL = 21, and KL is from K to L. Wait, KL is a side of the parallelogram. So, from point K (which is at (45, 0)), moving to point L. But in a parallelogram, vector KL equals vector JM. Wait, since KL is equal to MJ. Vector KL is from K to L, vector MJ is from M to J. 

This might get complicated. Maybe better to use coordinates with vectors. Let me try:

Let me set point J at (0,0). Let me take vector JK as horizontal, so point K is at (45, 0). Let me denote vector JM as some vector (p, q), so point M is at (p, q). Then, since it's a parallelogram, point L can be found as K + vector JM. Because in a parallelogram, the vector from K to L equals the vector from J to M. 

Thus, coordinates of L = K + vector JM = (45 + p, 0 + q). 

Then, the length of KL is 21. Vector KL is L - K = (p, q). So, the length of KL is sqrt(p² + q²) = 21. 

Additionally, the length of LM is equal to JK = 45. Vector LM is from L to M: M - L = (p - (45 + p), q - q) = (-45, 0). Wait, that's not correct. Wait, point L is (45 + p, q). Point M is (p, q). So, vector LM is M - L = (p - (45 + p), q - q) = (-45, 0). So, the length of LM is sqrt((-45)^2 + 0^2) = 45, which matches the given LM = 45. Good. 

Now, we need more info to find p and q. Also, we have the angles involving point R. But maybe we can proceed without needing that. 

Our goal is to find angle KJL, which is the angle at J between points K and L. So, in terms of vectors, this is the angle between vectors JK and JL. 

Vector JK is from J to K: (45, 0). Vector JL is from J to L: (45 + p, q). 

The angle between these two vectors can be found using the dot product:

cos(theta) = (JK · JL) / (|JK| |JL|).

Compute JK · JL = (45)(45 + p) + (0)(q) = 45*(45 + p).

|JK| = 45.

|JL| = sqrt((45 + p)^2 + q^2).

So,

cos(theta) = [45*(45 + p)] / [45 * sqrt((45 + p)^2 + q^2)] ] = (45 + p)/sqrt((45 + p)^2 + q^2).

But we need to find theta. However, we need to find p and q. From earlier, we have that sqrt(p² + q²) = 21 (from KL = 21). 

So, p² + q² = 21² = 441.

But we need another equation to solve for p and q. Where can we get that?

Well, we also know that the length of JM is 3a, which we found earlier as 21. Since JM is the vector from J to M, which is (p, q), its length is sqrt(p² + q²) = 21. Wait, but that's already accounted for by KL = 21. So, that gives us p² + q² = 441. 

Hmm, so this only gives us one equation. How do we find p and q? 

Wait, but we also have the angles involving point R. These angles are 30° and 70°, which might relate to the position of R. However, without more information about where R is located, it's challenging to incorporate that into our equations. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's another property we can use. Let me think. 

Since we're dealing with a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. So, the midpoint of JL is the same as the midpoint of KM. 

Coordinates of midpoint of JL: ((0 + 45 + p)/2, (0 + q)/2) = ((45 + p)/2, q/2).

Midpoint of KM: coordinates of K (45, 0) and M (p, q). Midpoint is ((45 + p)/2, (0 + q)/2), which matches. So that checks out. 

But still, without more information, we cannot determine p and q uniquely. 

However, maybe we can relate the angles given involving R. 

Let me consider the angles at point R. Suppose R is somewhere in the plane such that ∠LRM = 30° and ∠MRK = 70°. 

If I can express these angles in terms of coordinates, maybe I can find relations between p and q. 

But this seems very abstract. Let me try to imagine the scenario. 

Point R is such that from R, lines RL and RM form a 30° angle, and lines RM and RK form a 70° angle. 

Assume that R is positioned such that lines RL, RM, and RK are connected. 

Alternatively, maybe R is the intersection of two lines, like extending some sides. 

Alternatively, perhaps triangle RLM and triangle RKM are involved. 

But without concrete information about R's location, it's difficult to proceed. 

Wait, maybe there's another way. Let's think about the angles inside the parallelogram. 

In a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So, angle at J plus angle at K equals 180°. 

But angle KJL is not one of the internal angles of the parallelogram. It's an angle formed by a side and a diagonal. 

Alternatively, maybe we can find the measure of angle at J in the parallelogram, then relate it to angle KJL. 

In a parallelogram, the sum of angles at J and K is 180°. But how does angle KJL relate to that? 

Wait, angle KJL is part of triangle JKL. Let me consider triangle JKL. 

In triangle JKL, sides are JK = 45, KL = 21, and JL. We can use the Law of Cosines to find angle at J. But we need JL. 

Earlier, we had that in the parallelogram, the diagonals satisfy:

|JL|² + |KM|² = 2*(45² + 21²). 

But we don't know |KM|. However, if we can find |KM|, we can compute |JL|. 

But how? 

Wait, the length of KM can be computed using the same method as JL. Since KM is the other diagonal, connecting K to M. Coordinates of K (45,0) and M (p,q). So, vector KM is (p - 45, q - 0) = (p - 45, q). Its length squared is (p - 45)^2 + q^2. 

From the parallelogram identity:

|JL|² + |KM|² = 2*(45² + 21²)

But |JL|² is [(45 + p)^2 + q^2], and |KM|² is [(p - 45)^2 + q^2]. 

Adding these together:

[(45 + p)^2 + q^2] + [(p - 45)^2 + q^2] = 2*(45² + 21²)

Expand:

( (45^2 + 90p + p²) + q² ) + ( (45^2 - 90p + p²) + q² )

Combine terms:

45^2 + 90p + p² + q² + 45^2 - 90p + p² + q² = 2*45² + 2p² + 2q² 

So, left side becomes 2*45² + 2p² + 2q² = 2*(45² + p² + q²)

But we know p² + q² = 441 (from KL = 21). So:

Left side = 2*(45² + 441) = 2*(2025 + 441) = 2*(2466) = 4932

Right side is 2*(45² + 21²) = 2*(2025 + 441) = same as above, 4932. So, this confirms the identity, but it doesn't help us find |JL| or |KM|. 

Therefore, we need another way to find |JL|. 

Maybe we can use the angles given involving point R. Let me try to think differently. 

Suppose that point R is located such that lines RL and RM form a 30° angle, and lines RM and RK form a 70° angle. This suggests that at point R, the angles between RL and RM is 30°, and between RM and RK is 70°. So, the total angle around R from RL to RK would be 30° + 70° = 100°. 

If we consider triangle RKL or something else... Wait, but without knowing the exact position, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines in triangles involving R. 

For example, consider triangle RLM. In this triangle, we know ∠LRM = 30°, and sides RL, RM, LM. But we don't know the lengths. Similarly, in triangle RKM, ∠MRK = 70°, and sides RM, RK, KM. Again, missing information. 

But maybe there's a relationship between these triangles. 

Alternatively, since we know LM = 45, which is the same as JK. And KL = 21, which is same as MJ. 

Wait, but without knowing the position of R, it's challenging to relate these. 

Perhaps there's a property I'm missing here. Let me think about the angles given. The angles at R are 30° and 70°, adding up to 100°. Could this relate to some triangle or parallelogram property? 

Wait, if we consider that angle at R is 100°, and if R is placed such that lines RL and RK form this angle, perhaps there's a connection to the parallelogram's angles. 

Alternatively, since we're trying to find angle KJL, which is part of the parallelogram, and the given angles at R involve 30° and 70°, maybe there's a way to link them through triangle properties. 

Let me try to consider triangle JKL again. In triangle JKL, we have sides JK = 45, KL = 21, and JL. If we can find JL, we can use the Law of Cosines to find angle at J. 

But how to find JL? 

Wait, in the parallelogram, the diagonals split it into two congruent triangles. So, triangle JKL is congruent to triangle JMK? No, actually, in a parallelogram, the diagonals divide it into two congruent triangles. So, triangle JKL and triangle MKL are congruent? Wait, no. Each diagonal divides the parallelogram into two congruent triangles. So, diagonal JL divides it into triangles JKL and JML. 

So, triangle JKL and triangle JML are congruent. Therefore, JL is a common side. 

But how does this help? 

Alternatively, since we know the lengths of the sides of the parallelogram, maybe we can calculate the diagonals using the formula for parallelogram diagonals: 

d1² + d2² = 2(a² + b²), where a and b are the lengths of the sides. 

Here, a = JK = 45, b = KL = 21. So:

d1² + d2² = 2*(45² + 21²) = 2*(2025 + 441) = 2*2466 = 4932. 

But we need to find one diagonal, say JL. But we don't know the other diagonal KM. 

However, if we can find another relation between the diagonals, we could solve for them. 

But how? Without more information, it's impossible. 

Wait, but maybe the angles at R provide that information. Let me think. 

Assume that point R lies somewhere such that lines RL and RM form a 30° angle, and RM and RK form a 70° angle. Perhaps R is located such that lines from R pass through certain points, allowing us to apply the Law of Sines or Cosines in triangles involving those lines. 

For example, consider triangle RLM: it has sides RL, RM, LM = 45, with angle at R being 30°. Similarly, triangle RKM has sides RK, RM, KM, with angle at R being 70°. 

If we can relate these triangles, maybe we can find the ratio of sides or something. 

Let me attempt to write equations for these triangles. 

In triangle RLM: 

Using Law of Cosines: 

LM² = RL² + RM² - 2 * RL * RM * cos(30°)

Similarly, in triangle RKM: 

KM² = RK² + RM² - 2 * RK * RM * cos(70°)

But we don't know RL, RM, or RK. However, perhaps there's a relation between RL, RK, and other lengths. 

Alternatively, if we assume that R is a point such that lines RL and RK are extensions of sides or diagonals. 

Alternatively, maybe R is the intersection of the diagonals? But earlier we saw that the diagonals intersect at their midpoints. If R is the intersection point, then angles at R would depend on the type of parallelogram. 

But in a general parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other but are not necessarily perpendicular. The angles between the diagonals depend on the angles of the parallelogram. 

However, the given angles at R are 30° and 70°, which sum to 100°, suggesting that the diagonals might form angles of 30° and 70°, but this is speculative. 

Alternatively, if R is the intersection of diagonals, then the angles between the diagonals would be related to the angles of the parallelogram. 

Let me explore this possibility. Assume R is the intersection of diagonals JL and KM. In this case, the angles at R would be formed by the diagonals. 

In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other but are not necessarily equal. The angles between the diagonals depend on the specific angles of the parallelogram. 

Let me denote the angle between diagonals JL and KM at point R as θ. Then, depending on the type of parallelogram, θ varies. 

However, the given angles are 30° and 70°, which may not directly correspond to this. 

But if we assume that R is the intersection of diagonals, then the angles at R would be supplementary to each other. For example, if one angle is α, the other is 180° - α. But the given angles are 30° and 70°, which sum to 100°, not 180°, so this contradicts. Hence, R is likely not the intersection of diagonals. 

Back to square one. 

Alternative idea: since we need to find angle KJL, which is in triangle JKL, maybe we can relate it to the angles given at R through some external triangle. 

Let me consider that point R is such that RL and RM are parts of some lines, and RK is another. If I can express these lines in terms of the parallelogram's sides, maybe I can derive the angle. 

But without more info, it's challenging. 

Wait, maybe I missed a crucial piece of information. Let me review the problem statement again. 

The given predicates include MeasureOf(Angle(L, R, M)) = 30° and MeasureOf(Angle(M, R, K)) = 70°. These are angles at R. So, angle at R between L and M is 30°, and angle at R between M and K is 70°. So, if I imagine standing at point R, looking towards L, then turning toward M, the angle between those directions is 30°, and then from M to K, the angle is 70°. 

This implies that the total angle from L to K at R is 30° + 70° = 100°. So, angle LRK is 100°. 

If I can consider triangle LRK, where we know some sides or angles. 

But how? 

Let me think: in triangle LRK, we have angle at R is 100°, and sides RL, RK, and LK = 21. 

But we don't know RL or RK. However, if we can relate RL and RK to other parts of the parallelogram, maybe through the diagonals or other sides. 

Alternatively, if RL and RK are parts of the diagonals or sides. 

Wait, point L is part of the parallelogram, and point K is also part. So, if R is positioned such that RL and RK are lines from R to L and K, respectively. 

But without more constraints, this is too vague. 

Perhaps we need to consider that the given angles at R allow us to apply the Law of Sines in some triangles. 

For example, in triangle RLM, with angle at R = 30°, and in triangle RKM, angle at R = 70°. 

Let me denote:

In triangle RLM: 
- ∠R = 30°
- Side LM = 45
- Let RL = x, RM = y

Law of Sines: LM / sin(∠R) = RL / sin(∠M) = RM / sin(∠L)

But we don't know the other angles. Similarly for triangle RKM. 

But this seems too many variables. 

Alternatively, if we assume that RL and RK are related to the sides of the parallelogram. 

Wait, but I'm stuck. Maybe I need to switch approaches and look for another way to find angle KJL. 

Let me recall that in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, and the angle between a side and a diagonal can be found using trigonometry. 

Let me try to find the length of diagonal JL. 

As before, we have the formula for the diagonals in terms of the sides: 

d1² + d2² = 2(a² + b²)

Where d1 and d2 are the diagonals, a and b are the sides. Here, a = 45, b = 21, so:

d1² + d2² = 2*(45² + 21²) = 4932. 

But without knowing one diagonal, we can't proceed. 

However, if we can find another equation relating d1 and d2, we can solve for them. 

But how? 

Wait, perhaps using the angles at R. If we can relate the diagonals to the angles at R. 

Let me assume that R is a point such that lines RL and RM are parts of the diagonals. For example, if R is on diagonal JL and KM. But earlier, we saw that if R is the intersection of diagonals, the angles at R would be determined by the parallelogram's angles. 

But the given angles at R are 30° and 70°, which might relate to the angles between the diagonals. 

Let me suppose that R is the intersection point of the diagonals. Then, the diagonals JL and KM intersect at R. In this case, the angles at R would be determined by the slopes of the diagonals. 

Let me calculate the angle between the diagonals. 

In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, and the angle between them can be found using the formula involving the sides and the cosine of the angle between the sides. 

The angle θ between the diagonals can be calculated using:

tan(θ/2) = (2ab)/(a² - b²) ? Wait, not sure. 

Actually, the angle between the diagonals can be found using the formula derived from the vectors of the diagonals. 

Let me consider the vectors of the diagonals. 

In the parallelogram, diagonals are JL and KM. 

From earlier, vector JL is from J to L: (45 + p, q). Vector KM is from K to M: (p - 45, q). 

The angle φ between the diagonals can be found using the dot product:

cosφ = (JL · KM) / (|JL| |KM|)

Compute JL · KM = (45 + p)(p - 45) + q * q = (p² - 45²) + q² = (p² + q²) - 45² = 441 - 2025 = -1584.

So, the dot product is -1584. 

The magnitudes |JL| and |KM| can be expressed as:

|JL| = sqrt((45 + p)^2 + q^2)

|KM| = sqrt((p - 45)^2 + q^2)

So, cosφ = -1584 / (|JL| |KM|)

But we also know that from the previous equation: |JL|² + |KM|² = 4932.

Let me denote |JL| = d1 and |KM| = d2. Then:

d1² + d2² = 4932

And from the dot product:

d1 * d2 * cosφ = -1584

But we don't know φ. However, if we assume that φ is one of the given angles at R, like 30° or 70°, but this is uncertain. 

However, the given angles at R are 30° and 70°, which might be related to φ. For example, if φ is 30°, then cosφ = √3/2 ≈ 0.866, but the dot product is negative, so cosφ would be negative. Hence, φ would be obtuse. 

But the given angles at R are 30° and 70°, which are acute. So, this suggests that R is not the intersection of the diagonals. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to revisit the original problem and see if there's a simpler way. 

Wait, the question asks for m∠KJL, which is the angle at J between K and L. In the parallelogram, this angle is formed by side JK and diagonal JL. 

Let me recall that in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, but the angle between a side and a diagonal depends on the specific dimensions. 

Let me try to use vectors again. 

Vector JK is (45, 0). Vector JL is (45 + p, q). 

The angle between them is θ, which we want to find. 

From earlier, cosθ = (45 + p)/sqrt((45 + p)^2 + q^2).

But we also know that p² + q² = 441. 

Let me denote x = 45 + p, y = q. Then, p = x - 45, q = y. 

So, p² + q² = (x - 45)^2 + y^2 = 441.

Expanding: x² - 90x + 2025 + y^2 = 441 → x² + y^2 = 90x - 1584.

But we also have that |JL| = sqrt(x² + y^2). Let's call this d. 

So, d = sqrt(x² + y^2) = sqrt(90x - 1584).

Then, cosθ = x/d = x / sqrt(90x - 1584).

But we need to find x. How?

Wait, from the earlier equation, x = 45 + p, and p is part of the vector from J to M. 

But we also know that the length of JM is 21, which is sqrt(p² + q²) = 21. Which is already used. 

So, we have one equation: x² + y^2 = 90x - 1584, and we need another equation to solve for x. 

But where is the second equation? It must come from the angles at R. 

Let me think: the angles at R involve lines RL, RM, and RK. If I can express these lines in terms of x and y, perhaps I can derive another equation. 

Point L is at (45 + p, q) = (x, y). Point M is at (p, q) = (x - 45, y). 

So, line RL goes from R to L, line RM goes from R to M, and line RK goes from R to K (which is at (45, 0)). 

But without knowing R's coordinates, it's still challenging. 

However, if I assume that point R is such that the angles at R are 30° and 70°, maybe I can set up equations using the slopes of the lines. 

Let me assume that R is at some point (r_x, r_y). Then, the angle between RL and RM is 30°, and between RM and RK is 70°. 

This would involve calculating the slopes of these lines and using the tangent of the angles between them. 

But this is getting very complex and might not be feasible without more information. 

Given that I'm running out of ideas and time, perhaps I should reconsider if there's a simpler approach I've missed. 

Wait, the question provides options A-D, and the angles given are 30°, 70°, and the answer choices include 30, 70, 80, 100. 

Let me think: if angle KJL is part of the parallelogram, and given the angles at R, maybe it's related to the sum or difference of those angles. 

For example, if the angles at R are 30° and 70°, and if those angles are part of triangles that share sides with the parallelogram, maybe angle KJL is 180° - (30° + 70°) = 80°, which is option C. 

Or, maybe it's the supplement of one of the given angles. 

Alternatively, since angle at R is 30° and 70°, and if those angles are exterior to the parallelogram, then angle KJL could be 180° - 70° = 110°, but that's not an option. 

Wait, but the given angles at R are 30° and 70°, and if those are angles formed by extending sides, maybe angle KJL is 180° - 30° - 70° = 80°, which is option C. 

This is a shot in the dark, but given the lack of other ideas, and the presence of 80 as an option, it might be the correct answer. 

Alternatively, if the angles at R are part of a triangle where angle KJL is the third angle. 

For example, if R is such that triangle RKL has angles 30°, 70°, and angle at K. But this is speculation. 

Alternatively, if the sum of the angles at R is 100°, and angle KJL is supplementary to that. 

But I'm not confident. Given the options, and the fact that 80° is an option, and the angles at R are 30° and 70°, which add to 100°, and if angle KJL
