Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have a triangle VWX, and some given lengths. The question is asking for the cosine of angle X, expressed as a decimal to the nearest hundredth. The answer choices are A through D. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to recall the Law of Cosines because it relates the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles. The formula is c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(C), where C is the angle opposite side c. Since we're dealing with angle X, maybe I can use this here.

Wait, but before jumping into that, let me check if there's any other info. The problem mentions a RightAngle predicate. Wait, does that mean angle at a certain vertex is a right angle? Let me re-read the given predicates. Oh, the RightAngle(Angle(V, W, X)). Hmm, Angle(V, W, X) would be the angle at point W, since the middle letter is the vertex. So, angle at W is a right angle. That means triangle VWX is a right-angled triangle at W. 

So, triangle VWX is right-angled at W. Therefore, sides VW and WX are the legs, and VX is the hypotenuse. Wait, let me confirm the sides. Given that LengthOf(Line(W,V)) is 72, so that's side WV. Then LengthOf(Line(W,X)) is 21, so that's side WX. And LengthOf(Line(V,X)) is 75, which should be the hypotenuse VX. 

Let me verify if these satisfy the Pythagorean theorem. For a right-angled triangle, the sum of squares of the legs equals the square of the hypotenuse. So, 72 squared plus 21 squared should equal 75 squared?

Calculating 72²: 72*72. Let me compute that. 70² is 4900, plus 2*70*2=280, plus 2²=4. So total 4900+280+4=5184. Then 21² is 441. Adding them together: 5184 + 441 = 5625. Now, 75² is 5625. Yes! So that checks out. So the triangle is indeed a right-angled triangle at W.

Now, the question asks for the cosine of angle X. Let me visualize the triangle. Points V, W, X. Right angle at W. So, angle at X is one of the non-right angles. To find cos(X), which is adjacent over hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle. Wait, in a right-angled triangle, cosine of an acute angle is adjacent over hypotenuse. So, angle X is at point X. Let me think about which sides are adjacent and opposite.

In triangle VWX, angle at X. The sides relative to angle X: the side opposite to angle X is VW (since angle X is at point X, the opposite side is VW). The adjacent side would be WX. Wait, no. Wait, in a right-angled triangle, the two legs are adjacent to the right angle. For angle X, which is not the right angle, the sides adjacent to angle X would be the leg WX and the hypotenuse VX. Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally.

Let me label the triangle properly. Let's say point W is the right angle. So, points V and X are connected to W, forming the legs. So, VW is one leg (length 72), WX is another leg (length 21), and VX is the hypotenuse (75). So, angle at X is formed by sides WX and VX. So, for angle X, the adjacent side is WX (which is length 21), and the hypotenuse is VX (75). Wait, but wait—no. In trigonometry terms, for angle X, the adjacent side is the one that forms the angle along with the hypotenuse. Wait, perhaps I should consider the definition again.

Alternatively, using the Law of Cosines. But since it's a right-angled triangle, maybe it's easier with basic trigonometry.

But let's clarify. In triangle VWX, angle at X. Let me denote the sides as follows:

Opposite angle X: the side opposite is VW, which has length 72.

Adjacent to angle X: the sides that form angle X are WX and XV. Wait, angle at X is between sides WX and XV. So, the adjacent sides are WX and XV. Wait, but in trigonometry for a right-angled triangle, the adjacent side is the one that is next to the angle, not the hypotenuse. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing with the standard right-angled triangle setup.

Wait, in a right-angled triangle, each acute angle has a specific relation. For example, take angle at X. The sides relative to angle X are:

- Opposite: the side opposite angle X, which is VW (length 72).

- Adjacent: the side adjacent to angle X, which is WX (length 21).

- Hypotenuse: VX (length 75).

Therefore, cos(angle X) = adjacent / hypotenuse = WX / VX = 21 / 75.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So cos(X) is 21 divided by 75. Let me compute that. 21 ÷ 75 equals 0.28. Which is option A. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes confusion arises between adjacent and opposite.

Alternatively, using coordinates. Suppose point W is at (0,0), since it's the right angle. Then, since VW is length 72, and WX is length 21. Let me assign coordinates. Let’s assume W is at origin (0,0). Then, since it's a right angle at W, let's place V along the x-axis and X along the y-axis. So, point V would be at (72, 0), since WV is 72 units long. Point X would be at (0, 21), since WX is 21 units. Then, the hypotenuse VX connects (72,0) to (0,21). The length of VX is sqrt((72)^2 + (21)^2) which we already know is 75.

Now, angle at X. Let me find the cosine of angle at X. To do this, we can use vectors or coordinate geometry. Alternatively, in triangle VXW, angle at X. Let's consider vectors. At point X, the angle between segments XW and XV.

Vector XW goes from X to W: from (0,21) to (0,0): vector (0 - 0, 0 - 21) = (0, -21).

Vector XV goes from X to V: from (0,21) to (72,0): vector (72 - 0, 0 - 21) = (72, -21).

The cosine of angle between these two vectors is their dot product divided by the product of their magnitudes.

Dot product: (0)(72) + (-21)(-21) = 0 + 441 = 441.

Magnitude of XW vector: sqrt(0^2 + (-21)^2) = 21.

Magnitude of XV vector: sqrt(72^2 + (-21)^2) = 75.

Thus, cos(theta) = 441/(21*75) = 441 / 1575. Simplify that fraction: divide numerator and denominator by 21: 21/75, which reduces to 7/25. 7 divided by 25 is 0.28. So same result as earlier.

So cos(X) is 0.28. Looking at the options, that's option A. However, let me check once more to ensure I didn't mix up the sides.

Another way: in triangle VWX, angle at X. Using Law of Cosines. The Law of Cosines says that for any triangle, c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(C). Here, angle X is opposite side VW (which is length 72). Wait, no. Wait, angle X is at vertex X, so the side opposite angle X is VW. So, applying Law of Cosines:

VW² = WX² + VX² - 2 * WX * VX * cos(angle X)

Wait, no, Law of Cosines states that for angle X, the side opposite angle X is VW. So:

VW² = WX² + VX² - 2 * WX * VX * cos(angle X)

Wait, but that would imply:

72² = 21² + 75² - 2*21*75*cos(X)

Wait, but earlier we saw that 72² + 21² = 75², so substituting:

Left-hand side: 72² = 5184

Right-hand side: 21² + 75² - ... but wait, that would be 441 + 5625 = 6066 minus something. Wait, but according to Pythagoras, 72² + 21² = 75², so 72² = 75² - 21². Hence, substituting into the equation:

75² - 21² = 21² + 75² - 2*21*75*cos(X)

Subtract 21² + 75² from both sides:

Left side becomes 75² - 21² - 21² -75² = -2*(21²)

Right side becomes 0 - 2*21*75*cos(X)

So:

-2*(21²) = -2*21*75*cos(X)

Divide both sides by -2*21:

21 = 75*cos(X)

Hence, cos(X) = 21/75 = 0.28. Same result. So definitely, the answer is 0.28, which is option A.

But just to make sure I didn't misread anything. The problem said "the ratio of cos X". So yes, that's 21/75. Simplifying, 21 divided by 75. Let me calculate that decimal. 21 divided by 75. Well, 75 goes into 21 zero times. Add decimal: 210 divided by 75 is 2.8, so 0.28. Exactly. So 0.28 is correct. So the answer is A.
