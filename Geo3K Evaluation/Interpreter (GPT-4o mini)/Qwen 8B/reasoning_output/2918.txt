MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given information and figure out how the different elements relate. Let me start by listing out all the given predicates and see what they tell us.

We have points F, H, K, G, J. Lines FH, HK, FK form triangle FHK. Also, there's a line FG and JK, which are parallel. Additionally, point G lies on line FH, and point J lies on line HK. 

The question asks for x such that GJ is parallel to FK. Also, we're given some lengths: GH = x + 3.5, HJ = x - 8.5, FH = 21, and HK = 7. So we need to find x that satisfies these conditions with the parallelism.

First, let me sketch a rough diagram mentally. Points F, H, K form a triangle. Since FH is 21 units long, and HJ is part of another line? Wait, HJ is mentioned as x - 8.5. But where is J located? The predicate says Point J is connected via Line JK and Line FG. Also, Line FG and Line JK are parallel. And since G is on FH, and J is on HK. 

So maybe we have two transversals here: FG and JK, which are parallel. Then, perhaps the lines connecting them (like GJ and FK) could be involved in some proportionality because of the parallel lines. Maybe similar triangles?

Wait, if FG || JK, then maybe there's a transversal cutting them, creating corresponding angles. Alternatively, using the Basic Proportionality Theorem (Thales' theorem) which states that if a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle intersecting the other two sides, then it divides those sides proportionally. 

But first, let's note down all the given lengths. We know FH = 21. Since G is on FH, and GH = x + 3.5, then FG would be FH - GH. Wait, FH is from F to H, so if G is somewhere along FH, then FG + GH = FH. Therefore, FG = FH - GH = 21 - (x + 3.5) = 17.5 - x. 

Similarly, HJ is given as x - 8.5. Since J is on HK, which has length HK = 7. So HJ + JK = HK? Wait, but J is on HK, so HJ is part of HK. So if HJ = x - 8.5, then JK = HK - HJ = 7 - (x - 8.5) = 7 - x + 8.5 = 15.5 - x. 

Now, since FG || JK, maybe we can use the concept of similar triangles or proportions. Let me think about the configuration. 

Since FG and JK are parallel, and considering the lines connecting them—maybe the lines connecting G to J and F to K. The problem states that we need GJ || FK. Wait, no—the question says "Find x so that GJ || FK." Wait, wait, original question says "Find x so that GJ \parallel F K". So the segment GJ should be parallel to segment FK. 

Hmm. How does that happen? Let me consider coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to each point and setting up equations based on slopes. That might work. 

Let me try coordinate geometry. Assign coordinates to make things easier. Let me place point H at the origin (0,0). Since FH is a line, and FH = 21. Let me assume FH is horizontal for simplicity. So let me set H at (0,0) and F at (-21, 0), making FH = 21 units. Then, point G is on FH. Since GH = x + 3.5, and H is at (0,0), then G would be located at distance GH from H towards F. Wait, but direction matters. Since FH goes from F(-21,0) to H(0,0), moving from F to H. So point G is between F and H? Or beyond H? Well, GH is positive, so x + 3.5 must be positive. So x > -3.5. Also, HJ is x - 8.5, which must be positive since it's a length. So x - 8.5 > 0 → x > 8.5. So x must be greater than 8.5. 

So assuming G is between F and H. Let me calculate coordinates of G. From H(0,0), moving towards F(-21,0), but GH = x + 3.5. Wait, if H is at (0,0), then moving towards F, which is left along the x-axis. So the coordinate of G would be H minus vector HF scaled appropriately. Wait, the length from H to G is x + 3.5. So since H is at (0,0), and F is at (-21,0), then the direction from H to F is negative x-direction. So the coordinate of G would be (H_x - (GH), H_y). Wait, no—if we move from H towards F, then G is located at position H - (GH) * unit vector from H to F. Since the total length FH is 21, the unit vector from H to F is (-21)/21 = -1 in x-direction. So the coordinate of G is H + (GH) * (-1, 0). Wait, H is at (0,0). So G would be at (0 - (x + 3.5), 0) = (-x - 3.5, 0). 

Alternatively, since FG = 21 - GH = 21 - (x + 3.5) = 17.5 - x. So the distance from F to G is 17.5 - x. Since F is at (-21, 0), G is located at F plus (FG) units towards H. Wait, maybe better to compute coordinates directly. 

Coordinates:

F is at (-21, 0)

H is at (0, 0)

G is on FH, so along x-axis. Let me denote G's coordinate as (g, 0). The distance from H(0,0) to G(g, 0) is |g - 0| = |g|. Given that GH = x + 3.5, so |g| = x + 3.5. But since G is between F and H, g would be between -21 and 0. Therefore, g is negative. Hence, g = - (x + 3.5). So coordinate of G is (-x - 3.5, 0).

Now, point J is on HK. Let me find coordinates of K. Since HK is a line. Wait, the triangle FHK has points F, H, K. So H is at (0,0), K is some point. Let me assign coordinates to K. Let me suppose that K is at (a, b). Then, the line HK connects H(0,0) to K(a,b). The length HK is 7, so sqrt((a)^2 + (b)^2) = 7. However, without more info, it's hard to assign coordinates directly. Maybe instead of arbitrary coordinates, I can use vectors or ratios. 

Alternatively, since J is on HK, and HJ = x - 8.5. So the length from H to J is x - 8.5, and the entire HK is 7. Therefore, the ratio of HJ / HK = (x - 8.5)/7. Therefore, the coordinate of J can be determined by moving from H towards K by that fraction. 

But to proceed, maybe I need to express coordinates of J and K. Let me assume that K is at some coordinate, say (c, d). Then, vector HK is (c, d). So point J is located at H + [(x - 8.5)/7] * vector HK. So coordinates of J are ((x - 8.5)/7 * c, (x - 8.5)/7 * d). 

But this seems too abstract. Perhaps there's another way. Since FG || JK, and we need to find x such that GJ || FK. 

Wait, let me recall that if two lines are parallel, then their slopes are equal. So if I can find the slope of GJ and the slope of FK, set them equal, and solve for x. But to do that, I need coordinates of all points. 

Alternatively, maybe using vectors. Let me attempt this. 

First, define coordinates for all points. Let me fix coordinate system:

Set H at (0, 0). Let me take FH as x-axis, so F is at (-21, 0), H at (0, 0). Now, need to define K. Since triangle FHK exists, so K is some point not on FH. Let me assume K is at (p, q). Then, line HK connects (0,0) to (p,q), and its length is 7. So p² + q² = 49. 

Point J is on HK, and HJ = x - 8.5. Since the entire length HK is 7, then the coordinates of J can be parametrized as follows: 

Parametrize HK from H(0,0) to K(p,q). The parameter t is such that t=0 at H and t=1 at K. Then, the length from H to J is t * |HK| = t*7 = x - 8.5 → t = (x - 8.5)/7. 

Therefore, coordinates of J are (t*p, t*q) = ( (x - 8.5)/7 * p, (x - 8.5)/7 * q ). 

Now, line FG is from F(-21, 0) to G. Earlier, we found G's coordinates as (-x - 3.5, 0). 

Also, line JK is from J to K. Since FG || JK, their slopes must be equal. 

Compute slope of FG: since F(-21, 0) and G(-x - 3.5, 0). Both points lie on the x-axis, so the slope is (0 - 0)/( (-x -3.5) - (-21)) = 0. So FG is horizontal. Therefore, slope of FG is 0. Thus, JK must also be horizontal. 

But line JK connects J to K. For JK to be horizontal, the y-coordinate of J and K must be the same. Since K is at (p, q), and J is at ( (x - 8.5)/7 * p, (x - 8.5)/7 * q ). So the y-coordinate of J is [(x - 8.5)/7] * q. For JK to be horizontal, this y-coordinate must equal q (the y-coordinate of K). Therefore:

[(x - 8.5)/7] * q = q. Assuming q ≠ 0 (otherwise, points would be colinear on x-axis, but then triangle FHK wouldn't exist). So divide both sides by q:

(x - 8.5)/7 = 1 → x - 8.5 = 7 → x = 15.5. Wait, but this gives x = 15.5. But looking at the answer choices, none of them is 15.5. The options are 12, 12.5, 14.5, 17.5. Hmm. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, let me check again. Because if JK is supposed to be parallel to FG, which is horizontal, then JK must be horizontal. Therefore, the y-coordinate of J must equal the y-coordinate of K. So J's y-coordinate is [(x - 8.5)/7] * q. This equals q only if (x - 8.5)/7 = 1 → x = 15.5. But 15.5 isn't among the options. So either my assumption is wrong, or there's a miscalculation.

Wait, but maybe I made a wrong assumption about the coordinates. Let me re-examine.

Another possibility: since FG is parallel to JK, but I assumed FG is horizontal. But if FG is horizontal, then JK must also be horizontal. However, maybe there's another way. Wait, but according to the given, FG and JK are parallel. So yes, slope of FG equals slope of JK. But earlier calculation suggests x = 15.5, which is not an option. So something's wrong here.

Alternatively, maybe my coordinate setup is flawed. Let me check again. 

Wait, FG is from F(-21, 0) to G(-x -3.5, 0). So yes, it's along the x-axis. Therefore, slope is zero. Therefore, JK must also have slope zero. Which means that J and K have the same y-coordinate. So J's y-coordinate equals K's y-coordinate. 

But J is on HK, which goes from H(0,0) to K(p, q). So unless K is on the x-axis, which would make HK horizontal, but then triangle FHK would have all points on x-axis, which is degenerate. Therefore, K cannot be on x-axis. Hence, contradiction. Therefore, my previous conclusion that x = 15.5 implies that J and K have same y-coordinate, but that requires K being horizontally aligned with J, which may not hold. Wait, but if K is not on x-axis, then how can J and K have same y-coordinate? Only if the line HK is vertical? No, unless... Wait, no. If J is on HK, then unless HK is horizontal, J and K can't have same y-coordinate. So this suggests that my initial assumption that FG is horizontal and hence JK must be horizontal leads to inconsistency unless K is on x-axis, which is impossible. Therefore, there's a mistake here.

Wait, maybe FG is not horizontal? Wait, no, FG is from F(-21, 0) to G(-x -3.5, 0), which is along x-axis. Therefore, slope is zero. Hence, JK must have slope zero. Therefore, J and K must have same y-coordinate. Hence, line HK must be horizontal. Therefore, K must be at (something, 0). But then, if K is on x-axis, then triangle FHK is degenerate (all points on x-axis). Which contradicts the existence of triangle FHK. Therefore, my error must be elsewhere.

Ah! Wait, the given includes Line(F,G), Line(J,K), and Parallel(Line(F,G), Line(J,K)). So FG || JK. So line FG is parallel to line JK. Not necessarily that JK is horizontal. Wait, but in my coordinate system, FG is horizontal. So JK must be horizontal. But then, as discussed, that forces K to be on x-axis, which is invalid. Therefore, there must be an error in my coordinate setup.

Alternative approach: Maybe I shouldn't assume FH is horizontal. Let me try a different coordinate system. Let me place point H at (0,0), point F at (0, a), and point K at (b, 0), making triangle FHK. Wait, but then FH would be vertical. Maybe that complicates things. Alternatively, use vectors without fixing coordinate axes.

Alternatively, since FG || JK, and we need GJ || FK. Maybe using vectors or similar triangles.

Let me think differently. Since FG || JK, then the vector FG is scalar multiple of vector JK. Similarly, since GJ || FK, vector GJ is scalar multiple of vector FK.

Let me write vectors:

Vector FG = G - F

Vector JK = K - J

Since FG || JK, there exists scalar k such that FG = k * JK.

Similarly, for GJ || FK, vector GJ = m * FK for some scalar m.

But this might get complicated without knowing coordinates. Let me try to express variables in terms of x.

Earlier, I had expressions for GH = x + 3.5, HJ = x - 8.5. Also, FH = 21, HK = 7.

From earlier, FH = 21, so FG + GH = FH → FG = 21 - GH = 21 - (x + 3.5) = 17.5 - x.

Similarly, since HJ = x - 8.5 and HK = 7, then JK = HK - HJ = 7 - (x - 8.5) = 15.5 - x.

Now, if FG || JK, then the ratio of their lengths should be equal to the ratio of segments created by the parallel lines. Wait, but how?

Wait, if two lines are parallel, and cut by transversals, then the segments are proportional. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe triangle similarity.

Wait, consider triangle FGH and triangle JKH? Not sure. Alternatively, since FG || JK, maybe the triangles formed are similar.

Alternatively, using mass point geometry or coordinate geometry. Let me go back to coordinate system.

Let me assume that line FG and JK are parallel. Let me assign coordinates carefully.

Let me place point H at (0,0). Let me take line FH as x-axis, so F is at (-21, 0), H at (0,0). Now, need to define K somewhere. Let me assume K is at (0, 7), making HK vertical. Then, HK length is 7, which fits. Then, line HK is from (0,0) to (0,7), so vertical line. Then, point J is on HK, so its coordinates are (0, y), where y = HJ = x - 8.5. Since HJ is measured from H upwards, so J is at (0, x - 8.5). 

Then, line JK is from J(0, x - 8.5) to K(0,7), which is vertical line. So line JK is vertical. Now, line FG is from F(-21,0) to G. Since FG is parallel to JK, which is vertical. Hence, FG must also be vertical. But FG is from F(-21, 0) to G. For FG to be vertical, G must have the same x-coordinate as F, i.e., x = -21. But G is on FH, which is the x-axis from F(-21,0) to H(0,0). So if FG is vertical, then G must be at (-21, 0), which is point F itself. But then GH would be the distance from G=F to H, which is 21 units. But given GH = x + 3.5. So 21 = x + 3.5 → x = 17.5. Which is option D. But wait, let's check if this works.

If x = 17.5, then GH = 17.5 + 3.5 = 21, which matches FH = 21. So G coincides with F. But then line FG is just a single point. But the problem mentions Line(F,G), which would be undefined if G=F. Hence, this suggests x = 17.5 is invalid. So this approach has issues.

But why did this happen? Because I forced K to be at (0,7), making HK vertical, leading to JK being vertical, requiring FG to be vertical, forcing G=F. Which leads to x=17.5. But this might be a valid case if G coincides with F, but then FG is not a valid line. Hence, this suggests that my assumption of placing K vertically is causing contradictions. 

Alternative idea: Maybe FG and JK are not vertical/horizontal, but slant lines. Let me try again with general coordinates.

Let me assume that line FG has slope m, and line JK has the same slope m because they're parallel. Also, we need GJ || FK, so their slopes must be equal.

Let me denote coordinates:

As before, H is at (0,0), F at (-21,0). Let me define point K as (a, b), so that HK = 7. So sqrt(a² + b²) = 7. 

Point J is on HK. Parametric coordinates of J: since HJ = x - 8.5, and HK = 7, the parameter t is (x - 8.5)/7. So J = H + t*(K - H) = (ta, tb).

Thus, J = (ta, tb), where t = (x - 8.5)/7.

Now, point G is on FH. FH is from F(-21,0) to H(0,0). Let me parametrize G similarly. Let s be the parameter such that G divides FH in ratio s:(1-s), but since GH = x + 3.5, and FH = 21, then GH = s * FH? Wait, no. Let me think. The length from H to G is x + 3.5. Since FH = 21, the coordinate of G can be expressed as follows:

Starting from F(-21,0), moving towards H(0,0), the distance from F to G is FG = FH - GH = 21 - (x + 3.5) = 17.5 - x. So the coordinate of G is F + (FG/FH)*(vector FH). Vector FH is (21, 0). So the coordinate of G is F + (FG/FH)*(FH vector). Wait, the vector from F to H is (21, 0). So moving from F to H, the coordinate of G is F + (FG / FH) * vector FH. Wait, no. Wait, the total length FH is 21. If FG is the length from F to G, then the coordinate of G is F + (FG / FH) * vector FH. Since vector FH is from F to H, which is (21, 0). So G's coordinates are (-21, 0) + ( (17.5 - x)/21 ) * (21, 0) = (-21, 0) + (17.5 - x, 0) = (-21 + 17.5 - x, 0) = (-3.5 - x, 0). So G is at (-x - 3.5, 0). 

Now, we have coordinates of G(-x -3.5, 0), F(-21, 0), J(ta, tb), K(a, b). 

Now, line FG is from F(-21, 0) to G(-x-3.5, 0). As before, this is horizontal line, slope 0. Hence, line JK must also have slope 0. So line JK is horizontal. Hence, the y-coordinates of J and K must be equal. 

So for line JK to be horizontal, the y-coordinate of J (tb) must equal the y-coordinate of K (b). Hence, tb = b → t = 1. But t = (x - 8.5)/7. So (x - 8.5)/7 = 1 → x = 15.5. Again, same result as before. But x=15.5 is not an option. 

This suggests that there's a contradiction unless x=15.5. But since this isn't an option, there must be an error in assumptions. 

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in assuming that line FG is horizontal? No, because in this coordinate system, FG is from F(-21,0) to G(-x-3.5,0), which is along the x-axis. So slope is zero. Hence, JK must be horizontal. But this leads to x=15.5, which is not an option. 

But the answer choices don't include 15.5. Let me check the options again: A.12, B.12.5, C.14.5, D.17.5. 15.5 is between B and C. But since none is 15.5, perhaps there's a miscalculation. 

Wait, let me recheck the calculation where t = (x - 8.5)/7 = 1 → x = 15.5. Is there another scenario where line JK is horizontal? If K is at (a, b), and J is at (ta, tb), then for JK to be horizontal, tb = b → t=1. Hence, J=K. But that would mean HJ = HK = 7, so x - 8.5 = 7 → x = 15.5. But then HJ = 7, which would make J=K. But then line JK would be undefined (same point), which is impossible. Hence, this suggests that there's no solution under this setup, but the problem states there is a solution. 

This indicates that my assumption that FG is horizontal is incorrect. Wait, but in this coordinate system, FG is along x-axis. Why is this happening? Maybe because I fixed FH as x-axis, but maybe the actual configuration allows for FG and JK to be non-horizontal while still being parallel. Wait, but if FG is horizontal, then JK must be horizontal. So unless there's another interpretation of the problem.

Wait, going back to the original problem statement: Are FG and JK the lines, or the segments? The problem says "Line(F,G)" and "Line(J,K)", so lines, not segments. So even if points are extended, lines can be parallel. But in our case, if line FG is horizontal, then line JK must be horizontal, leading to x=15.5. But since this isn't an option, perhaps the error is elsewhere.

Wait, let me check if there's another way for FG || JK. Suppose line FG is not horizontal, but I forced it to be due to my coordinate choice. Maybe I should choose a different coordinate system where FG is not horizontal. 

Let me try a new approach without fixing FH as x-axis. Let me consider vectors and ratios.

Given FG || JK, and needing GJ || FK. Let me use vectors.

Let me denote vectors:

Let’s consider the vector FG and vector JK are parallel. So FG = k * JK for some scalar k.

Also, vector GJ = m * vector FK for some scalar m.

Let me express vectors in terms of coordinates.

Let me define points:

Let me let H be the origin (0,0). Let me let F be at some point, say (a, b), and K at (c, d). But this might get too abstract. 

Alternatively, since we have lengths, maybe using ratios. 

Since FG || JK, by the converse of Thales' theorem, if a line cuts two sides of a triangle proportionally, then it's parallel to the third side. But how does this apply here?

Wait, maybe considering triangle FHK, with a line FG and JK. But I'm not seeing the connection. 

Wait, let me think about the entire configuration. We have points F, H, K forming triangle. Points G on FH, J on HK. Lines FG || JK, and we need GJ || FK. 

Maybe applying the theorem of parallel lines and transversals. 

Since FG || JK, then the corresponding angles are equal. Also, since GJ || FK, their corresponding angles are equal. 

Let me imagine drawing lines FG and JK parallel, and lines GJ and FK parallel. This forms a parallelogram? Or some other figure. 

Alternatively, using the property that if two lines are parallel, then the ratio of segments cut on transversals is equal. 

For example, since FG || JK, then the ratio of FG/JK = FH/HK. Wait, is that true? Let me recall the intercept theorem. If two lines are cut by two transversals, then the segments are proportional. 

Wait, if FG || JK, and they are cut by transversals FH and HK, then FG/JK = FH/HK. 

Wait, let me clarify. The intercept theorem states that if two lines are cut by two transversals, then the segments are proportional. In this case, if FG || JK, then the transversals could be FH and HK. 

Wait, but how? Let me visualize: line FG and line JK are parallel. They are cut by transversals FH and HK. Wait, not sure. 

Alternatively, since FG and JK are parallel, and they are cut by transversals FJ and GK, or something like that. 

Alternatively, think of triangles. Let me consider triangle FHK. If FG || JK, then maybe triangle FGH ~ triangle JKH? Or some similar triangles. 

Let me explore this. Assume that FG || JK. Then, the angles ∠FGH and ∠JKH are equal (corresponding angles). Also, ∠GFH = ∠KJH. So triangles FGH and JKH might be similar. 

If that's the case, then the ratio of sides would be equal. 

Let me denote:

In triangle FGH and triangle JKH, if they are similar, then:

FG / JK = FH / HK = GH / KH.

Wait, let me check. If the triangles are similar, then corresponding sides are proportional. 

Assuming similarity, FG corresponds to JK, FH corresponds to HK, and GH corresponds to KH. 

So FG / JK = FH / HK = GH / KH.

Let me plug in the known values. 

We have FH = 21, HK = 7. So FH / HK = 21 / 7 = 3. 

So FG / JK = 3. 

But FG = 17.5 - x, and JK = 15.5 - x. So:

(17.5 - x) / (15.5 - x) = 3

Solving this equation:

17.5 - x = 3*(15.5 - x)

17.5 - x = 46.5 - 3x

Bring variables to one side:

- x + 3x = 46.5 - 17.5

2x = 29

x = 14.5

Which is option C. 

But wait, this assumes that triangles FGH and JKH are similar. How can I confirm this?

Well, if FG || JK, then the corresponding angles are equal, which would imply similarity. Let me verify.

Since FG || JK, then ∠FGH = ∠JKH (alternate interior angles if the transversal is HK). Wait, not sure. Let me draw it mentally. Line FG is parallel to line JK. Transversal GH intersects FG at G and JK at ...? Wait, line GH is part of FH. Line JK is parallel to FG. So if we consider the transversal GH, it intersects FG at G and JK at some point. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, since FG || JK, and they are cut by transversal FH and HK. Maybe the triangles are similar by AA criterion. 

But regardless, if we assume the ratio is 3, we arrive at x = 14.5, which is option C. Let me check if this makes sense.

Plugging x = 14.5:

GH = x + 3.5 = 14.5 + 3.5 = 18. 

But FH = 21, so FG = 21 - GH = 21 - 18 = 3. 

JK = 15.5 - x = 15.5 - 14.5 = 1. 

So FG / JK = 3 / 1 = 3, which matches the ratio FH / HK = 21 / 7 = 3. Hence, the proportion holds. 

Now, does this satisfy the condition that GJ || FK?

If the triangles are similar, then angles are equal, which would imply that GJ || FK. 

Because if △FGH ~ △JKH, then corresponding angles would be equal, leading to GJ || FK. 

Yes, this seems plausible. Hence, the correct x is 14.5, which is option C. 

But why didn't the coordinate method give this? Probably because of the earlier coordinate setup assumptions leading to contradictions. However, using the similarity approach gives a consistent result. 

Therefore, the correct answer is C.
