MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a trapezoid ABCD with AB and CD being the two bases since they're mentioned as parallel. The points S and T are midpoints of the legs, which I assume are AD and BC because in a trapezoid, the legs are the non-parallel sides. Wait, but actually, in a trapezoid, the legs are the sides that aren't the bases. Since AB and CD are the bases (they are parallel), then the legs would be AD and BC. So S is the midpoint of AD, and T is the midpoint of BC. 

Now, the problem states that CD is 14 units long, ST is 10 units, and AB is 2x. We need to find x. Let me recall some properties about trapezoids and midlines. Oh right! The midline (or median) of a trapezoid connects the midpoints of the legs and its length is the average of the lengths of the two bases. Wait, so if S and T are midpoints of the legs, then segment ST should be the midline. Therefore, the formula for the midline length is (AB + CD)/2. 

But according to the problem, ST is given as 10. So substituting the values, we have:

ST = (AB + CD)/2  
10 = (AB + 14)/2  

Multiplying both sides by 2 gives 20 = AB + 14. Then subtracting 14 from both sides, AB = 6. But wait, the problem says AB = 2x. Therefore, 2x = 6 → x = 3. 

Wait, but let me check again. Are there other factors here? The problem mentions that lines ST is parallel to both AB and CD. That aligns with the midline property. Also, since S and T are midpoints, connecting them forms the midline. So the calculation seems straightforward. However, maybe I missed something? Let me verify the midline formula. Yes, the midline (also called the median) of a trapezoid is indeed the segment connecting the midpoints of the legs, and it's equal to the average of the two bases. Therefore, the calculation holds. 

So if AB is 2x, then 2x = 6 → x=3. Looking at the answer choices, option B is 3. Therefore, the answer should be B.
