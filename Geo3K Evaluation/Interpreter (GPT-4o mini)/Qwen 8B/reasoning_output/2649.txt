====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out how to find x here. So, we have these predicates given. Let me start by breaking them down one by one.

First, there's a RightAngle predicate for Angle(A,C,B). That means the angle at point C between points A, C, and B is a right angle. So triangle ABC has a right angle at C. Wait, but the angle mentioned is Angle(A,C,B), which would be angle at C. So triangle ACB is a right-angled triangle at C. Got it.

Then, MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)) is 30 degrees. Let me parse that. The angle at point B, between points A, B, and C. So angle ABC is 30 degrees. Since the triangle is right-angled at C, the other two angles must add up to 90 degrees. So angle at B is 30°, so angle at A should be 60°, because in a triangle, angles sum to 180°. Right? Because 90 + 30 + angle at A = 180 → angle at A is 60°.

Now, LengthOf(Line(A,C)) is 24. So side AC is 24 units long. Then, LengthOf(Line(C,B)) is x, which is BC. And LengthOf(Line(A,B)) is y, which is AB. We need to find x.

So, since we have a right-angled triangle at C, with legs AC and BC, and hypotenuse AB. Wait, but wait: in a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. Here, the right angle is at C, so the hypotenuse is AB. Therefore, sides AC and BC are the legs, and AB is the hypotenuse.

We know AC = 24, BC = x, and AB = y. Also, angle at B is 30°, angle at A is 60°, right angle at C.

In a right-angled triangle, the sides relate via trigonometric ratios. For example, in a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. Specifically, the side opposite 30° is half the hypotenuse. Wait, let me recall: in such a triangle, the side opposite the 30° angle is the shortest one, then the other leg is √3 times that, and hypotenuse is twice the shortest.

But here, angle at B is 30°, so the side opposite angle B is AC. Wait, angle B is at point B, so the side opposite angle B is AC. Let me confirm: in triangle ABC, angle at B is 30°, so the side opposite is AC. So AC is opposite angle B. Therefore, if angle B is 30°, then AC is the side opposite, which would be the shorter leg in the 30-60-90 triangle.

Wait, but in a standard 30-60-90 triangle, the side opposite 30° is the shortest side. So if angle B is 30°, then AC (opposite) is the shortest side. But AC is given as 24. So the hypotenuse AB would be twice that, so 48? Wait, but let's check.

Alternatively, maybe I should use trigonometry. Let me think. In triangle ABC, right-angled at C. So tan(angle at B) equals opposite over adjacent. The angle at B is 30°, so tan(30°) = AC / BC. Wait, no. Wait, angle at B: the sides relative to angle B are: adjacent is BC, opposite is AC, and hypotenuse is AB.

So tan(angle B) = opposite / adjacent = AC / BC. So tan(30°) = AC / BC. Which gives us tan(30°) = 24 / x. Since tan(30°) is 1/√3, so 1/√3 = 24/x → x = 24√3. So that would make x = 24√3, which is option C. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, another way: since it's a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in ratio 1 : √3 : 2. The side opposite 30° is the shortest one. So angle B is 30°, so the side opposite (AC) is the shortest. Therefore, AC corresponds to 1 unit, BC (adjacent to angle B) corresponds to √3 units, and hypotenuse AB corresponds to 2 units.

Therefore, if AC = 24, then scaling factor is 24 / 1 = 24. Therefore, BC = 24 * √3, which is x = 24√3. So that's option C. So answer is C?

Wait, but let me verify again. Alternatively, maybe I got the opposite side wrong. Let me draw the triangle mentally. Points A, B, C with right angle at C. So AC and BC are legs. AB is hypotenuse. Angle at B is 30°, so angle between AB and BC is 30°. So in this case, the side opposite angle B is AC. So yes, AC is opposite angle B. So tan(30°) = AC / BC → 1/√3 = 24 / x → x = 24√3. So that seems correct.

Alternatively, using sine and cosine. For angle B, sin(30°) = opposite / hypotenuse = AC / AB. So sin(30°) = 24 / AB. Since sin(30°) is 1/2, so 1/2 = 24 / AB → AB = 48. Then, cos(30°) = adjacent / hypotenuse = BC / AB → BC = AB * cos(30°). Cos(30°) is √3/2, so BC = 48*(√3/2) = 24√3. Same result. So x is 24√3, which is option C. So the answer should be C.
