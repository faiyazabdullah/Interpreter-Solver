Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a circle with center O. Points A, B, C, D, E, F are mentioned. The problem says EC and AB are diameters. Also, there are some angles mentioned: ∠BO D ≅ ∠DOE ≅ ∠EOF ≅ ∠FOA. And we need to find the measure of arc AD.

First, I need to recall that in a circle, the central angle corresponds to the measure of its arc. So if two central angles are congruent, their arcs are congruent too. Since AB and EC are diameters, they each span 180 degrees because a diameter divides the circle into two semicircles.

Now, looking at the angles given: ∠BO D, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, ∠FOA are all congruent. Let me note that these angles are all at the center O, so they are central angles. Each of these angles has the same measure. Let's call each of these angles x degrees. 

Since the entire circle is 360 degrees, adding up all the central angles around point O should sum to 360°. But wait, how many such angles are there? Let me see. The angles listed are ∠BO D, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, ∠FOA. That's four angles. Wait, but maybe there are more? Or perhaps these angles cover parts of the circle?

Wait, let me think again. The points involved here are B, O, D; D, O, E; E, O, F; F, O, A. So starting from B, going through D, E, F, back to A. So those four angles make up the full circle? Or maybe not. Because AB is a diameter, so points A and B are endpoints of a diameter. Similarly, EC is another diameter, so E and C are endpoints. But where does point D fit in? Hmm.

Let me sketch mentally. Let's imagine circle O. AB is a diameter, so points A and B are opposite each other. EC is another diameter, so E and C are also opposite. Now, the angles mentioned are ∠BOD, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, ∠FOA. These angles are adjacent, each formed by connecting O to points along the circumference. So, starting from point B, moving through D, then E, then F, then back to A. So these four angles add up to the total angle around O, which is 360 degrees. Therefore, since all four angles are congruent, each is 360 divided by 4, which is 90 degrees. So each of those angles is 90°.

So, ∠BO D = ∠DOE = ∠EOF = ∠FOA = 90°. Therefore, each of these central angles measures 90 degrees. 

Now, the question asks for the measure of arc AD. To find arc AD, we need to find the measure of the central angle that subtends it. Let's see. Arc AD would correspond to the angle at O between points A and D. How do we find that angle?

Starting from point A, going counterclockwise, passing through F, E, D, then to B. Wait, but we need to see the position of D relative to A. Let me try to map the points step by step.

First, AB is a diameter. Let's assume standard position: Let’s fix point A at (1,0) and point B at (-1,0) on the unit circle centered at O(0,0). Then, EC is another diameter. Let's say point E is somewhere on the circle, and C is directly opposite. Now, the angles mentioned are ∠BO D, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, ∠FOA, each 90°. 

Let me consider the order of the points. Starting from B, the first angle is ∠BO D. So point D is located such that when you go from B to O to D, that angle is 90°. Then from D to O to E is another 90°, then E to O to F is another 90°, then F to O to A is another 90°. So starting from B, moving through D, E, F, then ending at A. 

So, the direction from B goes through D, E, F, then to A. So each of these segments BD, DE, EF, FA are each separated by 90° at the center. Wait, but since AB is a diameter, the angle from B to A is 180°. So let's see:

Starting from B, moving 90° to D, then another 90° to E, then another 90° to F, then another 90° to A. So total from B to A via these points would be 90*4=360°, which loops around the circle. Wait, but AB is a straight line (diameter), so from B to A is 180°, but according to the angles given, the path from B through D, E, F, A covers 360°, which suggests that the points are arranged in a way that goes around the circle once. However, AB is a diameter, so points A and B are opposite. So perhaps the arrangement is that moving from B, turning 90° each time, leading us through D, E, F, then to A. 

But how does that fit with AB being a diameter? Let me think again. If we start at B, then move 90° to D, then another 90° to E, another 90° to F, and another 90° to A. So from B to D is 90°, D to E is another 90°, making BE = 180°, so E would be opposite B? Wait, but EC is a diameter. So if E is opposite B, then C would be the point opposite E, so C would be opposite B. But AB is a diameter. So if AB is a diameter, then C would be the same as A? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe my assumption about the placement is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the points are arranged such that the angles between consecutive points are 90°. For example, starting from B, moving 90° to D, then another 90° to E, then another 90° to F, then another 90° to A. So from B to D is one quadrant, D to E another, E to F another, F to A another. Thus, the total from B to A would be 4 quarts, i.e., 360°, but since AB is a diameter, which is 180°, that suggests that the path from B to A through these points actually wraps around the circle once. So perhaps the arc from B to A via D, E, F is the major arc BA, which is 360° minus the minor arc BA (which is 180°). But that seems conflicting. 

Alternatively, maybe the angles are not all part of the same loop. Let me think again. The angles given are ∠BO D, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, ∠FOA. Each of these is a central angle. So the sum of these angles is 360°, since they are around point O. So each is 90°, as 360/4=90. 

Therefore, the arc from B to D is 90°, arc from D to E is another 90°, arc from E to F is another 90°, and arc from F to A is another 90°. So the total arc from B to A via D, E, F is 90+90+90+90=360°, which means that the path goes all the way around the circle. But since AB is a diameter, the direct arc from B to A is 180°, so the arc BA that passes through D, E, F is the major arc BA, which is 360°-180°=180°, but that contradicts the previous calculation. Wait, this seems confusing. 

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the arcs. Let me clarify. The central angles are ∠BO D, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, ∠FOA. So each of these angles corresponds to an arc between the points. 

∠BO D is the angle between OB and OD, so that corresponds to arc BD. Similarly, ∠DOE corresponds to arc DE, ∠EOF corresponds to arc EF, and ∠FOA corresponds to arc FA. 

Each of these arcs BD, DE, EF, FA is 90°, since the central angles are 90°. So the total arc length from B to A via D, E, F is BD + DE + EF + FA = 90+90+90+90 = 360°, which implies that starting at B, going through D, E, F, and ending at A, which would mean that A is the same as B? No, that can't be. There must be something wrong here. 

Wait, but if each of those arcs is 90°, then moving from B to D is 90°, then D to E another 90°, E to F another 90°, F to A another 90°, totaling 360°. So starting at B, moving 90° gets you to D, then another 90° to E, then another to F, then another to A. So that would place A at the same position as B? Which isn't possible unless the circle has overlapping points. Clearly, there's a contradiction here. 

Ah! Wait, maybe the arcs aren't all in the same direction. Perhaps some are clockwise and others counter-clockwise? Or maybe the points are placed differently. Alternatively, maybe there are overlapping arcs. Let me think again. 

Since AB is a diameter, points A and B are directly opposite each other. Let me assign coordinates to make it clearer. Let's suppose O is at the origin. Let me place point A at (1,0), so point B is at (-1,0). Now, EC is another diameter. Let me choose point E somewhere on the circle. Let's say E is at (0,1), so C is at (0,-1). Now, the angles given are ∠BO D, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, ∠FOA. Each of these is 90°. 

So starting with ∠BO D: This is the angle between OB (from O to B, pointing left) and OD (from O to D). So if ∠BO D is 90°, then OD is perpendicular to OB. Since OB is pointing left (along negative x-axis), then OD would point upward or downward. Let's assume it's upward, so D is at (0,1), but that's where E is. Wait, but E is already at (0,1). So D can't be there. Maybe D is at (0,-1)? But that's point C. Hmm, this suggests that maybe my initial assumption of placing E at (0,1) conflicts with D's position. 

Alternatively, maybe the points are arranged such that D is somewhere else. Let me try again. Suppose we have AB as horizontal diameter, from A(1,0) to B(-1,0). Let me define point D such that ∠BO D is 90°. Since OB is pointing to (-1,0), then OD needs to form a 90° angle with OB. So if OB is along the negative x-axis, then OD could be along positive y-axis or negative y-axis. Let's pick positive y-axis for simplicity. So D would be at (0,1). But that's the same as point E if EC is vertical diameter. Wait, if EC is a diameter, then E and C are endpoints. If E is at (0,1), then C is at (0,-1). So D is at (0,1)? But that would coincide with E. So that's impossible. Hence, maybe D is at (0,-1)? But that's point C. So conflict again. 

This suggests that my coordinate system may not be compatible with the given conditions. Maybe I need to adjust. Let me consider that EC is a different diameter. Let me choose E somewhere else. Suppose E is at (some arbitrary point) such that EC is a diameter. Let me instead focus on the angles. 

Given that ∠BO D is 90°, so OD is perpendicular to OB. Since OB is a radius pointing towards B, which is on the diameter AB. So if OB is pointing to B, then OD is perpendicular to OB. So if OB is along the negative x-axis, then OD is along positive y-axis or negative y-axis. Let me take positive y-axis. So D is at (0,1). Then, next angle is ∠DOE, which is 90°, so OE is perpendicular to OD. Since OD is along positive y-axis, OE would be along positive x-axis or negative x-axis. Let's take positive x-axis. So E is at (1,0), which is point A. But that's not allowed because E is supposed to be a distinct point. Wait, that's a problem. 

Alternatively, if from D (at (0,1)), the angle DOE is 90°, so OE is perpendicular to OD. Since OD is upwards, OE would be to the right or left. If we take right, then OE is along positive x-axis, which would be point A. Again, conflict. If we take left, then OE is along negative x-axis, which is point B. But then E would be at (-1,0), which is point B. Not good. 

Hmm, this suggests that placing D at (0,1) causes issues. Maybe D is at (something else). Wait, maybe the angles are not all in the same rotational direction. Let me think. Suppose ∠BO D is 90°, so from OB to OD is 90°, then ∠DOE is another 90°, so from OD to OE is another 90°, etc. So the total rotation from OB to OA would be 90° + 90° + 90° + 90° = 360°, which brings us back to the original direction. So starting at OB, rotating 90° to OD, then another 90° to OE, then another to OF, then another to OA. So OA would be in the same direction as OB, but rotated 360°, which is the same as OB. So OA would overlap with OB? Which isn't possible. 

This indicates that there's a mistake in assuming that all four angles are part of the same continuous rotation. Perhaps the angles are not all in the same direction. For instance, maybe some are clockwise and others are counterclockwise. But the problem states that ∠BO D ≅ ∠DOE ≅ ∠EOF ≅ ∠FOA, implying they are all equal, but not necessarily in the same direction. 

Alternatively, maybe the points are arranged in a star pattern. Another approach: since there are four equal central angles, each 90°, their corresponding arcs are 90° each. The total circle is 360°, so four arcs of 90° each make sense. Now, the arc from B to D is 90°, D to E is 90°, E to F is 90°, and F to A is 90°. So starting from B, moving 90° to D, then another 90° to E, another to F, another to A. So A is 90° away from F. 

But AB is a diameter, so the arc from A to B should be 180°. Let's see. From A to F is 90°, then from F to B? Well, the arc from F to B depends on where F is. Let me try to visualize. If we start at B, go 90° to D, then to E, then to F, then to A. So from B to D is 90°, D to E is another 90°, E to F another 90°, and F to A another 90°. So the arc from B to A through these points is 360°, meaning that A is where B started, which isn't possible unless it's a full rotation. 

Wait, this suggests that the arc from B to A via D, E, F is 360°, which implies that A is the same as B, which is impossible. Hence, there must be a misinterpretation. 

Maybe the arcs are not all in the same direction. Perhaps some are in one direction and others in the opposite. For example, ∠BO D could be clockwise, while ∠DOE is counterclockwise, etc. But without knowing the direction, it's hard to tell. 

Alternatively, maybe the points are arranged such that the arcs BD, DE, EF, and FA are each 90°, but in different directions. For instance, BD is 90° clockwise, DE is 90° counterclockwise, etc. But this is getting too vague. 

Another idea: since AB and EC are diameters, then points A and B are endpoints of one diameter, and E and C are endpoints of another. Let me consider that. So, AB and EC are two diameters, possibly intersecting at O. The angles mentioned involve points D, E, F. 

Also, there's a right angle mentioned: ∠AO F is a right angle. Wait, the problem says "RightAngle(Angle(A,O,F))", so ∠AOF is a right angle. Wait, but earlier we thought that ∠FOA was one of the equal angles. Wait, the given angles are ∠BO D ≅ ∠DOE ≅ ∠EOF ≡ ∠FOA. So ∠FOA is one of the equal angles. But the problem also mentions that ∠AOF is a right angle. Wait, ∠FOA is the same as ∠AOF? Yes, because angle at O between A and F. So ∠FOA is 90°, as per the given that all four angles are congruent. But the problem also states that ∠AOF is a right angle. Wait, that's redundant, because if ∠FOA is one of the equal angles, which are all 90°, then that confirms that ∠AOF is 90°. 

So combining this, since ∠FOA is 90°, and ∠AOF is the same thing. So that gives us that the arc from A to F is 90°, as the central angle is 90°. 

Now, returning to finding arc AD. Let's think about the positions of points. 

We know that AB is a diameter, so arc AB is 180°. Also, EC is a diameter, so arc EC is 180°. 

Now, we have several arcs: BD, DE, EF, FA are each 90°, as per the angles given. 

Let me try to map all points. Starting from B, moving 90° to D, then 90° to E, then 90° to F, then 90° to A. 

So from B to D: 90°, D to E: 90°, E to F: 90°, F to A: 90°. Total from B to A: 360°, meaning that A is the same as B? No, that's not possible. Unless the movement is not along the same direction. 

Wait, perhaps the arcs are going in alternating directions. Like, from B to D is clockwise 90°, D to E is counterclockwise 90°, E to F is clockwise 90°, and F to A is counterclockwise 90°, forming a square-like pattern. 

Alternatively, maybe the arcs are arranged such that each subsequent arc is in the opposite direction. This is getting too ambiguous. 

Alternatively, think about the fact that there are two diameters AB and EC. Let me consider the positions of these diameters. 

Assume AB is horizontal, from A(1,0) to B(-1,0). Let me assume EC is another diameter, say vertical, from E(0,1) to C(0,-1). Now, we have points D and F. 

From earlier, we know that arc BD is 90°, so starting from B(-1,0), moving 90° along the circumference. Assuming the arc BD is in the counterclockwise direction, then from B(-1,0), moving 90° counterclockwise would bring us to point D. On a circle, moving 90° counterclockwise from B(-1,0) would go through the upper half-circle. 

Let me calculate the coordinates. Starting at B(-1,0), moving 90° counterclockwise along the circumference. In terms of angles, the central angle from OB to OD is 90°, so the angle between vectors OB and OD is 90°. Since OB is pointing to (-1,0), which is 180°, adding 90° counterclockwise would give us 180° + 90° = 270°, which corresponds to the point (0,-1), which is point C. But that's already occupied by point C. So D cannot be there. 

Alternatively, if the arc BD is measured clockwise. Moving 90° clockwise from B(-1,0) would go down to (0,-1), which again is point C. So D would be at C? But C is already defined as the endpoint of diameter EC. So that's conflicting. 

This suggests that either my assumptions about the placement of diameters are incorrect, or there's a different configuration. 

Wait, maybe EC is not aligned vertically. Let me assume that EC is at some other angle. Let's say EC is at 45°, but that complicates things. 

Alternatively, maybe the points D and F are not on the same diameter. Let me think differently. Since there are four equal central angles, each 90°, and AB and EC are diameters, perhaps the points D, E, F are arranged such that they divide the circle into quarters. 

For example, if we have diameters AB and EC intersecting at O, creating angles between them. Let's say AB is horizontal, and EC is at some angle. The central angles between the points are 90°, so the points D, E, F are spaced every 90°. 

But since AB and EC are diameters, they split the circle into 180° each. So if we have four equal angles of 90°, maybe the points are arranged as follows: starting from A, moving 90° to F, then another 90° to E, another to D, and another to B. Wait, but this is speculative. 

Alternatively, since ∠FOA is 90°, which means that arc FA is 90°, so point F is 90° away from A. If AB is a diameter, then from A to B is 180°. So if FA is 90°, then F is halfway between A and B? No, because if you go from A, 90° along the arc, you'd reach a point that's 90° away from A. Depending on the direction. 

Let me try to place point F. If ∠FOA is 90°, then arc FA is 90°. Assume we're moving counterclockwise from A to F. So if A is at (1,0), moving 90° counterclockwise would put F at (0,1). So F is at (0,1). Then, since EC is a diameter, and E is connected to C. If F is at (0,1), then E would be at (0,-1), since EC is a diameter. So E is at (0,-1), and C is at (0,1)? Wait, no—EC is a diameter, so E and C are endpoints. If F is at (0,1), then C would be the opposite of E. Let me say E is at (0,1), so C is at (0,-1). But then F is at (0,1), which is the same as E. That's a conflict. 

Ah, so if F is at (0,1), then E would be at (0,-1), making EC the vertical diameter. Then, point D is determined by the angle ∠BO D = 90°. Let's see. 

Point B is at (-1,0). We need to find point D such that ∠BO D is 90°. So OD is perpendicular to OB. Since OB is pointing to (-1,0), OD should be pointing upward or downward. If we choose upward, then D is at (0,1), but that's where F is. Conflict again. If we choose downward, D is at (0,-1), which is point C. So again, conflict. 

This suggests that there's an inconsistency unless D is at a different location. 

Perhaps the issue is that the angles are not all in the same direction. Let me consider that ∠BO D is clockwise and ∠DOE is counterclockwise, etc. 

Suppose from B, moving clockwise 90° to D, then from D, moving counterclockwise 90° to E, then from E, moving clockwise 90° to F, then from F, moving counterclockwise 90° to A. This creates a zigzag path. 

Let's try this. Starting at B(-1,0), moving 90° clockwise to D. Clockwise from B would be downwards, so D is at (0,-1). Then from D(0,-1), moving counterclockwise 90° to E. Counterclockwise from D would be upwards, so E is at (0,1). Then from E(0,1), moving clockwise 90° to F. Clockwise from E would be to the right, so F is at (1,0), which is point A. But that makes F coincide with A, which is not allowed. 

Hmm. Alternatively, from E(0,1), moving clockwise 90° would go to (1,0), which is point A. So F is at A, which is not possible. 

This seems like a recurring problem. Perhaps the angles are not all in the same direction, or there's a different configuration. 

Let me think about the fact that ∠AOF is 90°, so OA and OF are perpendicular. Since OA is a radius, and OF is another radius. So points A and F are endpoints of radii that are perpendicular. So if A is at (1,0), then F is at (0,1) or (0,-1). Let's say F is at (0,1). Then, from the previous, E is at (0,-1) because EC is a diameter. 

Now, we need to find point D such that ∠BO D is 90°. Point B is at (-1,0). So OD is perpendicular to OB. Since OB is along the negative x-axis, OD should be along the positive or negative y-axis. If we choose positive y-axis, D is at (0,1), but that's where F is. If we choose negative y-axis, D is at (0,-1), which is E. So again, conflict. 

Unless D is at a different point. Wait, but if D is at (0,1), which is F, then ∠BO D is 90°, and ∠DOE would be the angle from OD to OE. If D is F at (0,1), then OE is from O to E at (0,-1). So the angle between OF and OE is 180°, which is not 90°. So this contradicts the given that ∠DOE is 90°. 

This is very confusing. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's forget coordinates and focus on the arcs. 

We know that there are four equal central angles: ∠BO D, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, ∠FOA, each measuring 90°. So the arcs BD, DE, EF, FA are each 90°. 

So the total arc from B to A through D, E, F is 90+90+90+90 = 360°, which implies that this path goes all the way around the circle. So starting at B, going through D, E, F, and ending at A, which is the same as starting point B? No, that can't be. 

Wait, this suggests that the arc from B to A is 360°, which is impossible. Hence, there must be an error in my understanding. 

Wait, maybe the arcs are not all in the same direction. For example, some arcs are clockwise, others counterclockwise. Let's assume that the arcs BD, DE, EF, and FA are all clockwise. Starting at B, moving clockwise 90° to D, then another 90° to E, another to F, and another to A. So from B to D is 90°, D to E is another 90°, E to F another 90°, and F to A another 90°. So total from B to A is 360°, meaning that A is the same as B, which is impossible. 

Alternatively, some arcs are clockwise and others counterclockwise. For example, BD is clockwise 90°, DE is counterclockwise 90°, EF is clockwise 90°, and FA is counterclockwise 90°. This would create a sort of spiral. 

Let me try. Start at B, move clockwise 90° to D. Then from D, move counterclockwise 90° to E. Then from E, move clockwise 90° to F. Then from F, move counterclockwise 90° to A. 

This would mean that the total displacement from B to A is zero, meaning A is back to B? Not sure. 

Alternatively, this might form a square around the circle. For example, if you have four points spaced 90° apart, but since AB and EC are diameters, which are 180° apart, this adds complexity. 

At this point, I might need to accept that the arc AD is composed of certain portions of these 90° arcs. Let's try to find arc AD. 

Arc AD is the arc from A to D. To find this, we need to determine how many of the 90° arcs are between A and D. 

Let me consider the arcs: FA is 90°, so from F to A is 90°. If I can find the relationship between F and D, then I can find arc AD. 

From earlier, we know that ∠EOF is 90°, so arc EF is 90°. So from E to F is 90°. Also, ∠DOE is 90°, so arc DE is 90°. So from D to E is 90°. 

So, if I can express arc AD in terms of these arcs. Let's think about the path from A to D. 

If we go from A to F is 90°, then from F to E is... Wait, arc FE is part of the arc from F to E? Or from E to F? Earlier, we had arc EF is 90°, so from E to F is 90°. So from F to E is -90°, or equivalently, 270°. 

But I need to find the arc from A to D. Let me try to trace from A back through the points. 

From A, if we go backwards through the arcs, we might find D. 

Since arc FA is 90°, then arc AF is 90°. From F, we have arc FE is 90°, so from F to E is 90°. From E, arc ED is 90°, so from E to D is 90°. So from D, we have arc DB is 90°, from D to B is 90°. 

So, starting from A, going through F to E to D to B. 

So, the arc from A to D would be arc AF (90°) + arc FE (90°) + arc ED (90°)? Wait, no. If I go from A to F is 90°, then from F to E is another 90°, so total from A to E is 180°, then from E to D is another 90°, so total from A to D is 180 + 90 = 270°. But that's the major arc AD, whereas the minor arc AD would be 90°, since the total circle is 360°. 

Wait, but depending on the direction, the arc could be major or minor. The problem asks for m∠AD, which typically refers to the measure of the arc, but it's ambiguous. However, in circle problems, unless specified otherwise, it usually refers to the smaller arc. 

But let's check. If arc from A to D is 270°, that's the major arc. The minor arc would be 90°. But how to determine which one? 

Alternatively, let's think about the position of D. If arc from D to E is 90°, and arc from E to F is 90°, and arc from F to A is 90°, then from D to E to F to A is 270°, so from D to A is 270°. But that would imply that the arc DA is 270°, which is large. 

However, the problem says to find m∠AD, which is likely referring to the arc AD. If the arc is 270°, that would be a reflex angle, but sometimes arc measures are taken as the smallest possible. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in tracing the arcs. Let me re-express. 

From the given, the arcs are:

- BD = 90°
- DE = 90°
- EF = 90°
- FA = 90°

So, starting from B, going through D (arc BD), then E (DE), then F (EF), then A (FA). 

So the arc from B to A is BD + DE + EF + FA = 90+90+90+90 = 360°, which loops around the circle. So, the arc from B to A is 360°, which means that A is the same as B, which is not possible. 

This suggests that the arcs are not all in the same direction. Perhaps some are in the opposite direction. For example, arc BD is clockwise, DE is counterclockwise, EF is clockwise, and FA is counterclockwise. 

In this case, the total from B to A would be: 

Clockwise from B to D (90°), counterclockwise from D to E (90°), clockwise from E to F (90°), counterclockwise from F to A (90°). 

This would mean that the net movement is: 

From B to D: +90° clockwise  
From D to E: -90° (counterclockwise)  
From E to F: +90° clockwise  
From F to A: -90° (counterclockwise)  

Total change: +90 -90 +90 -90 = 0°. So, overall, it returns to the starting point. This suggests that the path loops around, but doesn't provide info about arc AD. 

Alternatively, let's consider the arc from A to D. If we can find the arc between A and D, considering the arcs we have. 

From the arcs: FA is 90°, so from F to A is 90°. From E to F is 90°, so from E to F is 90°. From D to E is 90°, so from D to E is 90°. 

So, from A to F is 90°, then from F to E is 90°, then from E to D is 90°. So, from A to D is the combination of these three arcs: A to F (90°), F to E (90°), E to D (90°), totaling 270°. So the arc AD is 270°, which is the major arc. 

But the problem asks for m∠AD, which could be interpreted as the measure of the arc AD. If it's the major arc, then 270°, but that's not among the answer choices. The options are 45, 135, 180, 360. 

Wait, but 270° is not an option. So maybe I'm missing something. 

Alternatively, perhaps the arc AD is the minor arc. If the total circle is 360°, and the major arc AD is 270°, then the minor arc AD is 360 - 270 = 90°. So the measure of arc AD is 90°, which is option A. 

But why would the problem ask for the minor arc? It depends on the convention. Usually, when asked for the measure of an arc between two points, it's the smaller one unless stated otherwise. 

But let me verify. Let's assume that arc AD is 90°. How? 

If the arc from A to D is 90°, then it would mean that the central angle ∠AOD is 90°. Let's see if this is consistent with the given information. 

If ∠AOD is 90°, then arc AD is 90°. How does this relate to the other arcs? 

If arc AD is 90°, then from A to D is 90°, which would mean that from D to A is 90°. But according to our earlier calculation, the arc from A to D is 270°, which would suggest that the minor arc is 90°. 

So perhaps the answer is 90°, which is option A. But wait, the answer choices include A: 45, B: 135, C: 180, D: 360. So 90° is not listed. Wait, this is a problem. 

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in calculating the arc AD. Let me think again. 

If arc FA is 90°, and arc DE is 90°, and arc EF is 90°, then from F to E to D is 90° + 90° = 180°. So from A to F is 90°, then from F to E is 90°, then from E to D is 90°, making total from A to D: 90 + 90 + 90 = 270°, as before. 

But if the arc AD is 270°, which is the major arc, then the minor arc AD would be 360 - 270 = 90°. 

So, if the question is asking for the measure of the arc AD, it's ambiguous, but likely wants the smaller arc. Hence, 90°. But 90° is not an option. Wait, the answer choices are A:45, B:135, C:180, D:360. None of these is 90. This suggests a mistake in my reasoning. 

Wait, let me double-check the problem statement. It says: "Find m∠AD." Wait, is it the measure of the arc AD, or the measure of the angle at A? No, the notation m∠AD usually denotes the measure of the arc AD. But maybe it's the measure of the angle at O, ∠AOD? 

Wait, the problem says "m∠AD". Typically, in geometry, m∠AD would refer to the measure of the angle at vertex A, between points D and ... but that's unclear. Wait, no, the notation m∠AD is not standard. Usually, it's m∠AOB for an angle at O. So perhaps it's a typo, and they meant m∠AOD? Or m∠ADO? Or maybe it's the measure of arc AD. 

Given the context, and the presence of arc measures in circle problems, it's likely asking for the measure of arc AD. 

But since none of the answer choices is 90°, I must have made a mistake. Let me rethink. 

Let me try a different approach. Given that AB and EC are diameters, so they pass through O. The angles ∠BO D, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, ∠FOA are all equal. Let's denote each as x. So 4x = 360°, hence x = 90°. 

Now, since AB is a diameter, points A and B are 180° apart. Similarly, EC is a diameter, so E and C are 180° apart. 

Now, let's consider the positions of D and F. 

Since ∠FOA is 90°, then arc FA is 90°. So, from F to A is 90°. 

Similarly, ∠DOE is 90°, so arc DE is 90°. 

Now, let's try to find the position of D relative to A. 

If we can find the arc from A to D, it would depend on the positions of other points. 

Let me consider the full circle. The circle has 360°. Let's assume that the points are arranged in the order B, D, E, F, A, going around the circle. Each segment between these points is 90°. 

So, starting at B, arc BD is 90°, then arc DE is 90°, arc EF is 90°, arc FA is 90°. 

Thus, from B to D is 90°, D to E is 90°, E to F is 90°, F to A is 90°. 

Now, to find arc AD, we need to find the arc from A to D. 

Let's think about the arc from A to D. If we go from A to F is 90°, then from F to E is 90°, then from E to D is 90°, so from A to D is 90 + 90 + 90 = 270°, as before. But this is the major arc. The minor arc AD would be 360 - 270 = 90°. 

But since the answer choices don't include 90°, there must be a mistake. 

Wait, perhaps I missed that AB is a diameter, so arc AB is 180°. If arc from A to B is 180°, and arc from B to D is 90°, then arc from A to D would be arc AB + arc BD = 180° + 90° = 270°, which is the same as before. 

But this still gives 270°, which isn't an option. 

Wait, maybe the arc AD is the arc that doesn't pass through B? Let me think. If the arc from A to D is the shorter one, it would be 90°, but how? 

Alternatively, maybe the arc AD is composed of arc AF (90°) plus arc FD. What is arc FD? 

From F to D: from F to E is 90°, and from E to D is 90°, so total from F to D is 180°. So arc FD is 180°. Thus, arc AD would be arc AF (90°) + arc FD (180°) = 270°, or arc AD could be the other way: from A to D through B, which is 180° + 90° = 270°. 

Still 270°. 

But since this isn't an option, I must have misunderstood the problem. Let me read it again. 

"In ⊙O, EC and AB are diameters, and ∠BO D ≅ ∠DOE ≅ ∠EOF ≅ ∠FOA. Find m∠AD."

Wait, maybe it's not arc AD, but the angle at A? Or at O? 

Wait, the notation m∠AD could be ambiguous. If it's the measure of the angle at O between A and D, then it would be the central angle ∠AOD. 

If that's the case, then we need to find ∠AOD. 

To find ∠AOD, let's consider the positions of A and D.
