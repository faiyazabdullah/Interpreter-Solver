MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a triangle ABC with some given conditions. Let me start by listing out all the given predicates to make sure I don't miss anything.

First, Triangle(A,B,C). That means points A, B, and C form a triangle. Then there's a RightAngle at Angle(B,A,C). Wait, the notation here might be tricky. In standard terms, Angle(B,A,C) would mean the angle at point A, formed by points B, A, and C. But the predicate says it's a right angle. So angle at A is a right angle? Or wait, maybe I got the order wrong. Let me recall: the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(B,A,C) is the angle at point A between points B and C. So yes, angle at A is a right angle. Therefore, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at A.

Next, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)),30). Let me parse this. MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)) is the measure of the angle at point B, because the middle letter is the vertex. So angle at B is 30 degrees. Wait, but if the triangle has a right angle at A, then the other two angles must add up to 90 degrees. Since one of them is 30 degrees, the third angle at C would be 60 degrees. 

Now, the sides: LengthOf(Line(A,C)) is 7. So AC = 7 units. LengthOf(Line(B,C)) is x, so BC = x. And LengthOf(Line(A,B)) is y, so AB = y. We need to find x.

So, we have a right-angled triangle at A, with angle at B being 30 degrees. Let me sketch this mentally. Point A is the right angle, so sides AB and AC are the legs, and BC is the hypotenuse. Wait, but hold on: in a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. So if the right angle is at A, then BC is the hypotenuse. So BC is opposite angle A, making it the longest side.

Given that, angle at B is 30 degrees. So in triangle ABC, angle at B is 30°, angle at A is 90°, so angle at C is 60°. Now, the sides are related to these angles. In a right-angled triangle, the sides are in proportion to the sine of their opposite angles. Alternatively, since angle B is 30°, the side opposite to it (which is AC) should be half the hypotenuse. Wait, let me think again.

In a right-angled triangle, the side opposite the 30° angle is half the hypotenuse. Wait, yes! Because in a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2, where the side opposite 30° is the shortest leg, then the other leg is √3 times that, and hypotenuse is twice the shortest leg.

But let's confirm which sides correspond to which angles. Let me label the triangle properly. Let me consider triangle ABC with right angle at A. So, vertices A, B, C. So, AB and AC are the legs, and BC is the hypotenuse.

Angle at B is 30°, so angle ABC = 30°. Then, the side opposite angle B is AC. Because in triangle ABC, each angle is opposite the corresponding side. So angle at B is opposite side AC. Therefore, AC is opposite 30°, so AC should be half the hypotenuse BC. Wait, because in a 30-60-90 triangle, the side opposite 30° is half the hypotenuse. So if AC is opposite angle B (30°), then AC = (1/2)*BC. Given that AC is 7, then BC = 14. But wait, that would make x = 14, which is option D. However, let me check if that's correct.

Wait, but another way: in triangle ABC, with right angle at A, angle at B is 30°, so angle at C is 60°. Then, the sides:

AB is adjacent to the 30° angle at B, AC is opposite to it, and BC is the hypotenuse.

So, tan(30°) = opposite / adjacent = AC / AB. Which is tan(30°) = 7 / AB. Since tan(30°) is 1/√3, so 1/√3 = 7 / AB → AB = 7√3. Then, using Pythagoras, AB² + AC² = BC². Plugging numbers: (7√3)^2 + 7^2 = BC² → 147 + 49 = 196 = BC² → BC = 14. Therefore, x = BC = 14. So the answer would be D. But let me cross-check.

Alternatively, since angle at B is 30°, then the side opposite (AC) is 7, so hypotenuse BC is twice that, so 14. Hence, x=14. So answer D. But wait, the options include D as 14. But let me check again. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying which side is opposite which angle.

Let me re-examine the angle labels. Angle at B is angle ABC. So in triangle ABC, angle at B is between AB and BC. Wait, no. The angle at B is between AB and BC? No, in triangle ABC, the angle at B is between AB and BC? Wait, the points are A, B, C. So angle at B is between segments BA and BC. Wait, but BA is going from B to A, and BC is from B to C. So yes, angle at B is between BA and BC. So the sides forming angle B are BA and BC. Therefore, the side opposite angle B is AC. Yes, because in triangle ABC, each angle is opposite the side that doesn't touch it. So angle B is opposite side AC. So AC is opposite angle B (30°), so AC = 7, so hypotenuse BC is twice that, hence 14. Therefore, x is 14. So answer D.

But wait, another thought: sometimes people confuse the labeling. Let me confirm once more. Suppose we have triangle ABC with right angle at A. So, AB and AC are legs. Then, BC is hypotenuse. Then angle at B is 30°, so angle between AB and BC. Wait, but angle at B is between AB and BC? Wait, AB is connected to B, and BC is connected to B. So yes, the angle at B is between AB and BC. Therefore, the side opposite angle B is AC. So AC is opposite angle B, which is 30°, so AC = 7. Then, in a 30-60-90 triangle, hypotenuse is twice the shorter leg. Here, the shorter leg is AC (opposite 30°), so hypotenuse BC is 14. Thus, x = BC = 14. So answer D. But looking at the options, D is 14. So that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the sides. Let me use trigonometry. In triangle ABC, right-angled at A. So sin(angle B) = opposite / hypotenuse. Angle B is 30°, opposite side is AC = 7. Hypotenuse is BC = x. Therefore:

sin(30°) = AC / BC → 1/2 = 7/x → x = 14. Exactly. So that confirms x = 14. Therefore, the correct answer is D.
