<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we need to find the value of x based on the given angle measures. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

First, the predicates:

1. Measure of Angle(D, A, C) equals 2x.
2. Measure of Angle(B, E, C) equals y².
3. Measure of Angle(D, B, C) equals 3x - 15.
4. Measure of Angle(D, C, B) equals 68 degrees.

Wait, the fourth one says Angle(D, C, B) is 68. Let me visualize this. Points D, C, B—so that's angle at point C between points D and B? Wait, angle notation can sometimes be confusing. In standard notation, Angle(X, Y, Z) refers to the angle at point Y between points X and Z. So Angle(D, C, B) would be the angle at point C between points D and B. So that's ∠DCB, which is 68 degrees.

Now, looking at the other angles:

Angle(D, A, C) is ∠DAC, which is at point A between D and C. Then Angle(B, E, C) is ∠BEC, at point E between B and C. And Angle(D, B, C) is ∠DBC, at point B between D and C. 

Hmm. I need to figure out how these angles relate to each other. Maybe there's a triangle involved here. Let me try to sketch a rough diagram mentally.

Assuming points D, B, C are connected. Since there's an angle at B (∠DBC = 68°), and another angle at C (∠DCB = 68°). Wait, if those two angles are part of a triangle, maybe triangle DBC? But then, in triangle DBC, the sum of angles should be 180°. However, we know two angles: ∠DBC is 68°, ∠DCB is 68°, so the third angle at D would be 180 - 68 - 68 = 44°. Wait, but where does angle DAC come into play?

Alternatively, perhaps points A, B, C, D, E are arranged in some configuration. Let me think again. There's also an angle involving point A (∠DAC) which is 2x. Also, angle BEC is y². Hmm. Maybe there are intersecting lines or something like that.

Wait, maybe triangle ABC with some points D and E added. Let me consider that possibility. Suppose ABC is a triangle, and D is a point somewhere, possibly on AB or AC, and E is another point. But without more info, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, maybe there's a transversal or parallel lines involved.

Alternatively, since there are angles at different points, maybe considering vertical angles, supplementary angles, or other angle relations. For example, if lines intersect, forming vertical angles or linear pairs.

Another thought: since ∠DBC is 68°, and ∠DCB is 68°, then triangle DBC has two angles equal, making it an isosceles triangle. Therefore, sides opposite those angles are equal. So BD = CD? Because in triangle DBC, angles at B and C are equal, so sides opposite them (CD and BD respectively) are equal. So BD = CD.

But how does that help us? Maybe not directly yet. Let's check the other angles.

We have ∠DAC = 2x. That's an angle at point A. If A is part of triangle ADC, then maybe we can relate angles in that triangle. But without knowing other angles in triangle ADC, it's tricky.

Also, ∠BEC = y². This introduces another variable y, but the question asks for x. So unless there's a relation between x and y, maybe through some geometric relationship. But the problem doesn't mention anything about y, so perhaps there's a way to eliminate y?

Wait, maybe there's a triangle involving E? Like, if E is a point such that BEC forms an angle, perhaps connected to other parts of the figure. Without a diagram, it's challenging, but maybe we can assume certain configurations.

Let me think again. Let's look at the angles given. We have ∠DBC = 68°, ∠DCB = 68°, so triangle DBC is isosceles with BD=CD. Now, maybe there's another triangle involving point A. For instance, if line AD intersects BC at some point, creating angles. Or maybe point E is on a certain line.

Alternatively, could there be a case where angles around point C add up to something? For example, if there are multiple angles at point C, like ∠ACB and ∠DCB. Wait, ∠DCB is given as 68°, which might be part of ∠ACB if D lies on AB or something. Wait, but without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe considering straight lines. For instance, if points A, D, and C are colinear, then ∠DAC would be a straight angle, but that seems unlikely because it's given as 2x. Unless there's a transversal or something.

Wait, another idea: maybe triangle ABC with D on AB and E on BC or something. Let me try to imagine that. Suppose ABC is a triangle. Point D is on AB, and point E is on BC. Then, angle DAC is formed by AD and AC. But then, how does ∠DBC come into play?

Alternatively, maybe D and E are points such that lines connect them, forming various angles. For example, if lines DB and EC intersect at some point, creating vertical angles. But again, without a diagram, it's difficult to be precise.

Wait, maybe focusing on the angles that involve variables x and y. The question asks for x, so maybe y cancels out or relates to x via another equation.

Given that ∠BEC is y². Is there a way to express y² in terms of other angles? Perhaps if ∠BEC is part of a triangle where other angles are known, allowing us to write equations.

Alternatively, maybe triangle BEC has angles that sum to 180°, so if we can find expressions for its other angles in terms of x or y, we can form an equation.

But since we don't have much info about the rest of the figure, maybe we need to focus on the angles that directly relate to x.

Looking back, we have three angles involving x:

1. ∠DAC = 2x
2. ∠DBC = 3x - 15
3. ∠DCB = 68° (which is fixed)

Wait, earlier I considered triangle DBC having angles at B and C as 68°, leading to angle at D being 44°. But ∠DBC is given as 3x - 15. Wait, hold on! Wait, the third predicate says MeasureOf(Angle(D, B, C)) is 3x -15. Which is ∠DBC, which was previously thought to be 68°. Wait, wait, no—the fourth predicate says MeasureOf(Angle(D, C, B)) is 68°, which is ∠DCB. So ∠DBC is 3x -15, and ∠DCB is 68°, so in triangle DBC, the angles are ∠DBC = 3x -15, ∠DCB = 68°, and the third angle at D would be 180 - (3x -15 + 68).

So that third angle at D would be 180 - 3x +15 -68 = 180 - 3x -53 = 127 - 3x. But what is that angle? It's ∠BDC. So ∠BDC = 127 - 3x.

Now, if we can relate this angle ∠BDC to other angles in the figure. For example, if there's a triangle involving point A and D, like triangle ADC. In triangle ADC, we have ∠DAC = 2x, and if we can find other angles, maybe we can set up an equation.

But to do that, we need to know more about triangle ADC. For example, if line DC is connected to point A, then ∠ADC would be part of that triangle. However, without knowing other angles or sides, it's still unclear.

Wait, but maybe there's a straight line or some other relationship. For example, if points A, D, and C are colinear, then ∠DAC would be a straight angle, but that contradicts the measure being 2x. Unless there's another line intersecting.

Alternatively, suppose that line BD intersects with line AC at point D. No, that might complicate things further.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider that ∠DAC is 2x, and if there's a triangle where this angle is part of, maybe triangle ADC. In triangle ADC, the angles are ∠DAC = 2x, ∠ACD (which might be part of ∠DCB?), and ∠ADC.

But ∠DCB is given as 68°, which is at point C between D and B. So if we consider point C, and lines CB and CD, then ∠DCB is 68°, which suggests that line CD splits angle at C into two parts. Wait, but if there's another line from C to A, then ∠ACD would be adjacent to ∠DCB. So total angle at C would be ∠ACB = ∠ACD + ∠DCB. But unless we know ∠ACB, we can't proceed.

Alternatively, if there's a triangle ABC, with point D on AB, and point E on BC. Then, ∠DAC is part of triangle ADC, and ∠DBC is part of triangle DBC. But again, without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging.

Wait, but maybe there's a way to use the fact that in triangle DBC, we have angles at B and C as 3x -15 and 68°, respectively, and angle at D as 127 - 3x. If we can find another expression for angle at D, perhaps relating to another triangle.

For example, if point A is such that line DA creates some relationship with angle at D. Suppose that line DA extends to meet with line BC at some point, creating a larger triangle. Or maybe triangle ADC and triangle DBC share side DC.

Alternatively, if there's a straight line through D and A, then angle ADC could be supplementary to some other angle.

Wait, let me think differently. Suppose that angles at point D: ∠ADB and ∠ADC could be related. But again, without knowing the exact position of points, it's hard to say.

Wait, but maybe we can use the fact that the sum of angles around a point is 360°, or that angles in a triangle sum to 180°. Let's see.

In triangle DBC, angles are:

∠DBC = 3x -15,

∠DCB = 68°,

and ∠BDC = 127 - 3x.

So adding them together: (3x -15) + 68 + (127 - 3x) = 3x -15 + 68 + 127 -3x = (-15 + 68 + 127) = 180°, which checks out. So that's consistent. But this doesn't give us new information.

Now, what about angle ∠DAC = 2x? If this angle is part of another triangle, maybe triangle ADC. In triangle ADC, the angles are:

At A: ∠DAC = 2x,

At C: ?

At D: ?

But unless we can express those other angles, we can't proceed. However, if we can find a relationship between ∠ADC and ∠BDC, which we found earlier as 127 - 3x.

Wait, if points A, D, and B are colinear, then ∠ADC and ∠BDC would be supplementary. Wait, if D is on AB, then line DC would split the angle at D. Wait, this is getting too vague without a diagram.

Alternative Idea: Maybe the angles at point D are related. For example, if there's a straight line through D, then angles on either side would add up to 180°. Suppose that ∠ADC and ∠BDC are supplementary. If that's the case, then ∠ADC + ∠BDC = 180°. 

So, if ∠ADC is part of triangle ADC, and ∠BDC is 127 - 3x, then:

∠ADC = 180° - (127 - 3x) = 53 + 3x.

But in triangle ADC, the sum of angles is 180°, so:

∠DAC + ∠ACD + ∠ADC = 180°.

We have ∠DAC = 2x,

∠ADC = 53 + 3x,

And ∠ACD is the angle at point C between A and D. But earlier, we had ∠DCB = 68°, which is the angle at C between D and B. So if points A, C, and B are colinear, then ∠ACD would be adjacent to ∠DCB, making ∠ACB = ∠ACD + ∠DCB.

But if that's the case, then ∠ACD = ∠ACB - ∠DCB. However, without knowing ∠ACB, we can't proceed. Unless ∠ACB is related to another angle.

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involving point E. Since ∠BEC = y², and if E is on some line, maybe we can relate y to other variables.

But this seems too indirect. Let me think again. Are there any other given angles? The only ones are the four mentioned. So, unless there's a missing piece, perhaps the key is to realize that angles around point C or point D relate to each other.

Wait, going back to triangle ADC: ∠DAC = 2x, ∠ADC = 53 + 3x (if my previous assumption about supplementary angles is correct), and ∠ACD needs to be determined. If ∠ACD is related to ∠DCB (68°), then maybe they are supplementary if A, C, B are colinear. Wait, if A, C, B are colinear, then ∠ACB is a straight line, so ∠ACD + ∠DCB = 180°. Thus, ∠ACD = 180° - 68° = 112°.

If that's the case, then plugging into triangle ADC:

2x + (53 + 3x) + 112 = 180

Combine terms:

(2x + 3x) + (53 + 112) = 180

5x + 165 = 180

Subtract 165:

5x = 15 → x = 3

Wait, but 3 isn't among the answer choices. The options are 30, 34, 60, 68. So this suggests a mistake in my assumptions.

Where did I go wrong? Let me check.

I assumed that ∠ADC and ∠BDC are supplementary. Why? Because if D is on AB, then line DC would create angles at D. Wait, if D is on AB, then line DC connects to C, so angles at D would be ∠ADC and ∠BDC? Not necessarily. If D is on AB, then line DC would form two angles at D: one between A-D-C and another between B-D-C. But unless there's a straight line, those angles wouldn't be supplementary. Wait, if D is on AB, then points A-D-B are colinear. So, angle at D between A and B is a straight line (180°). But if we draw line DC, then ∠ADC is part of triangle ADC, and ∠BDC is part of triangle DBC. These two angles (∠ADC and ∠BDC) would be adjacent, forming a straight angle along line AB. Hence, ∠ADC + ∠BDC = 180°. Yes, that makes sense. So my earlier assumption was correct.

Therefore, ∠ADC = 180° - ∠BDC = 180° - (127 - 3x) = 53 + 3x.

Then in triangle ADC, angles are:

∠DAC = 2x,

∠ACD = ?

∠ADC = 53 + 3x.

Earlier, I assumed ∠ACD = 112°, but why?

Because if points A, C, B are colinear, then ∠ACB is a straight angle (180°), and ∠ACD + ∠DCB = 180°, hence ∠ACD = 180° - 68° = 112°. But this assumes that points A, C, B are colinear. Is that a valid assumption? Well, without knowing the exact configuration, but since ∠DCB is given, and if C is the vertex of that angle, then yes, it implies that points D and B are on different sides of line CB. But if A is on the same line as CB, then ∠ACD would make sense.

However, if this assumption leads to x=3, which is not in the options, then there's a contradiction. So either my assumption is wrong, or there's another relationship I missed.

Wait, perhaps ∠ACD isn't 112°, but instead something else. Let me re-examine.

If ∠ACD is part of triangle ADC, and ∠DCB is 68°, but ∠ACD and ∠DCB may not be supplementary unless A, C, B are colinear. But if they aren't, then ∠ACD could be different.

Alternatively, maybe ∠ACD is equal to ∠DCB? No, that would require some symmetry.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating ∠ACD. Let me redo the calculation.

In triangle ADC:

Sum of angles is 180°.

So:

∠DAC + ∠ACD + ∠ADC = 180°

We have ∠DAC = 2x,

∠ADC = 53 + 3x,

Thus:

2x + ∠ACD + 53 + 3x = 180

Which simplifies to:

5x + 53 + ∠ACD = 180

So ∠ACD = 180 - 5x - 53 = 127 - 5x.

But ∠ACD is also related to ∠DCB. If points A, C, B are colinear, then ∠ACD + ∠DCB = 180°, so:

127 - 5x + 68 = 180

Which gives:

195 - 5x = 180 → 5x = 15 → x = 3. Again, same result, which is not in the options.

This suggests that my assumption that A, C, B are colinear is incorrect. Hence, there must be another way to relate ∠ACD with other angles.

Alternatively, maybe ∠ACD is equal to some other angle. For example, if there's a triangle involving point E, where ∠BEC = y². But without knowing more about E, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, perhaps there's a different relationship. Let me think about all the given angles again.

We have:

- ∠DBC = 3x -15

- ∠DCB = 68°

- ∠DAC = 2x

- ∠BEC = y²

Maybe there's a triangle involving point E where we can relate y² to other angles. For example, if E is on a certain line, forming triangle BEC, and we can express its angles in terms of known quantities.

But since we don't have enough information about point E, this seems challenging. Unless there's a missing connection.

Alternatively, maybe the sum of angles around point C. At point C, we have angles: ∠DCB = 68°, and possibly others depending on the configuration. For example, if there's another line from C to A, then ∠ACB would be composed of ∠ACD and ∠DCB.

But again, without knowing ∠ACB, it's hard to proceed. Unless ∠ACB is related to another angle.

Wait, let's consider triangle ABC. Suppose that point D is on AB, and point E is on BC. Then, lines AD and CE intersect at some point. But without knowing where E is, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe E is on AD, or another line.

Alternatively, since there's an angle ∠BEC = y², perhaps it's an external angle to some triangle, allowing us to relate it to other angles.

Wait, but this is getting too speculative. Maybe I need to consider that the given data allows for only one equation, and thus x can be solved with the existing information.

Wait, earlier calculations led to x=3, which isn't an option. So there must be a mistake in assuming that ∠ACD = 127 - 5x and trying to relate it to ∠DCB. Let me reconsider that.

Perhaps I should explore another angle. Let's look at triangle DBC again. We have angles at B (3x -15), at C (68°), and at D (127 - 3x). Now, if there's another triangle involving point A, maybe triangle ABD or something. But without knowing more, it's tough.

Wait, what if there's a straight line through A and C? If so, then ∠DAC is part of that line. But again, not sure.

Alternative Approach: Let's consider that the sum of angles around point D. If there are multiple angles at D, like ∠ADC and ∠BDC, which we earlier said are supplementary. So:

∠ADC + ∠BDC = 180°

From before, ∠BDC = 127 - 3x, so ∠ADC = 53 + 3x.

Now, in triangle ADC, we have:

∠DAC = 2x,

∠ADC = 53 + 3x,

∠ACD = ?

So, 2x + (53 + 3x) + ∠ACD = 180 → ∠ACD = 127 - 5x.

Now, if we can find another expression for ∠ACD, we can solve for x.

How? Maybe ∠ACD is related to ∠DCB (68°) via some property. For example, if lines AC and BC are part of a larger structure.

Suppose that line AC is extended beyond C to a point, forming an angle with line CD. But without knowing the exact configuration, this is guesswork.

Wait, but if we consider that ∠ACD is an exterior angle for triangle DBC. Wait, no, ∠ACD is at point C, while ∠DCB is also at point C. So if line AC meets line CD at C, then ∠ACD and ∠DCB are adjacent angles at point C, forming ∠ACB. So ∠ACB = ∠ACD + ∠DCB = (127 - 5x) + 68 = 195 - 5x.

Now, if we can relate ∠ACB to another angle, perhaps in triangle ABC. But unless we know more about triangle ABC, we can't proceed.

Wait, but maybe there's a triangle involving point E where ∠BEC = y², and if we can relate that to ∠ACB or something else.

Alternatively, if there's a triangle where ∠BEC is an external angle, relating to other angles. For example, if E is on AB, then ∠BEC could be related to angles in triangle BEC.

But without knowing where E is, this is speculative. However, maybe we can assume that ∠BEC is an external angle to triangle ABC, or something like that.

Alternatively, since ∠BEC = y², and we have another angle involving y, maybe through some relationship. But since we don't have any other equations involving y, this seems stuck.

Wait, but maybe there's a way to link x and y through some geometric principle. For example, if y² is an angle in a triangle that includes x, but without more info, it's impossible to say.

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that y² is equal to some other angle, like ∠ACB or something. For example, if ∠BEC is equal to ∠ACB, then y² = 195 - 5x. But this is just a guess.

But since the question asks only for x, and there's no mention of y in the answer choices, perhaps y is a red herring, and we can ignore it. But how?

Wait, the problem states that the answer choices are A-D, and none of them are y-related. So maybe y² is irrelevant, and the answer can be found solely from the other angles. But earlier attempts gave x=3, which is not an option, suggesting that my assumptions were wrong.

Let me revisit the initial setup. Maybe I misread the predicates.

Let me list the predicates again:

1. Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D, A, C)), 2 * x) → ∠DAC = 2x

2. Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B, E, C)), y^2) → ∠BEC = y²

3. Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D, B, C)), 3*x - 15) → ∠DBC = 3x -15

4. Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D, C, B)), 68) → ∠DCB = 68°

Wait, maybe I mixed up the order of points in the angle notation. For example, Angle(D, C, B) is ∠DCB, which is at point C between D and B. So ∠DCB = 68°, as I thought.

Now, let's try to consider triangle DBC again. Angles at B: 3x-15, at C: 68°, so angle at D: 180 - (3x-15 + 68) = 180 - 3x +15 -68 = 127 -3x.

Now, suppose that line AD intersects with line BC at some point, say, G. Then, maybe there's some angle relationships there. Or, if there's a triangle involving A and D.

Wait, but we have ∠DAC = 2x. If we consider triangle ADC, and if we can find another angle in it, we can solve for x.

But earlier, I tried assuming that ∠ACD = 127 -5x and then trying to relate it to ∠DCB. But that led to x=3, which isn't an option.

Maybe there's another angle relationship. Let me think: if lines AD and BC intersect at some point, creating vertical angles or something.

Alternatively, if points A, D, and B are collinear, then ∠DAC is part of that line. But again, without knowing, it's hard.

Wait, here's a different idea: maybe the angles at point D (from triangle DBC) and the angle ∠DAC are related through some triangle. For example, if there's a triangle where ∠DAC is an exterior angle to triangle DBC.

Wait, if ∠DAC is an exterior angle to triangle DBC, then it would be equal to the sum of the remote interior angles. But for that, point A would have to be positioned such that DA is extending from D, forming an exterior angle at D. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if line DA is an extension of line DC, making ∠DAC an exterior angle. But without knowing the configuration, it's unclear.

Wait, let's try this: Assume that line DA is such that it forms an exterior angle with respect to triangle DBC. For example, if DA is extending from D, forming an angle with DC. Then, ∠DAC would be an exterior angle to triangle DBC at point D.

If that's the case, then ∠DAC = ∠DBC + ∠DCB.

So, ∠DAC = (3x -15) + 68 = 3x + 53.

But according to the given, ∠DAC = 2x. So:

2x = 3x + 53 → -x = 53 → x = -53, which is impossible. So this assumption is invalid.

Alternatively, maybe ∠DAC is an exterior angle to another triangle. For example, if it's an exterior angle to triangle ADC. But that would mean it's equal to the sum of the remote interior angles, which would be ∠ACD + ∠ADC.

But ∠DAC = 2x = ∠ACD + ∠ADC = (127 -5x) + (53 + 3x) = 180 - 2x.

So, 2x = 180 - 2x → 4x = 180 → x = 45. Still not in the options.

Hmm. This is perplexing. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that all given angles are part of a single diagram, and try to find relationships between them.

We have:

∠DBC = 3x -15,

∠DCB = 68°,

∠DAC = 2x,

∠BEC = y².

Let me try to consider triangle DBC first. As before, angles at B: 3x-15, at C: 68°, so angle at D: 127 -3x.

Now, let's consider point A. If we can find a relationship between ∠DAC and the other angles.

If there's a line from A to D, forming ∠DAC = 2x, and if this line intersects with other elements.

Alternatively, if there's a triangle ABD, where ∠ABD is something. But without knowing, it's hard.

Wait, what if there's a triangle where ∠DAC is part of, and another angle is known. For example, if ∠ADC is related to ∠BDC.

Earlier, we assumed they are supplementary, giving ∠ADC = 53 + 3x.

If we use that in triangle ADC, and assume that ∠ACD is something else.

Wait, let's try to think about all angles at point C. We have ∠DCB = 68°, and possibly ∠ACD. If those are adjacent, then ∠ACB = ∠ACD + ∠DCB.

But if ∠ACB is part of another triangle, like triangle ABC, then maybe we can relate it to other angles.

But without knowing anything about triangle ABC, this is hard.

Wait, but if we assume that ∠ACB is a right angle, or some other value, but there's no indication of that.

Alternatively, if there's a triangle where ∠BEC is related to ∠ACB. For example, if E is on AB, then ∠BEC could be related to ∠ACB via some theorem.

But without knowing the exact configuration, this is too speculative.

Wait, maybe the key is that there are two expressions for angle at D: one from triangle DBC (127 -3x) and another from triangle ADC (53 + 3x). But these are both angles at D, so they should be equal if they're the same angle. Wait, no, unless D is part of both triangles, which it is.

Wait, but ∠BDC is 127 -3x, and ∠ADC is 53 + 3x. Are these two angles at point D? Yes, if D is the common vertex. So, if ∠BDC and ∠ADC are the same angle, then 127 -3x = 53 + 3x → 127 -53 = 6x → 74 = 6x → x = 74/6 ≈ 12.33, which is not an option.

But that would imply that ∠BDC and ∠ADC are the same angle, which would mean that points A, B, and C are colinear with D on AB, making ∠BDC and ∠ADC supplementary, which they aren't. So this is conflicting.

Wait, I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think of another way. Let's consider that all the given angles are part of a diagram where x can be determined through a system of equations.

We have:

1. From triangle DBC: ∠DBC = 3x -15, ∠DCB = 68°, ∠BDC = 127 -3x.

2. From triangle ADC: ∠DAC = 2x, ∠ADC = 53 + 3x (assuming supplement to ∠BDC), and ∠ACD = 127 -5x.

Now, if we can relate ∠ACD to ∠DCB, which is 68°, perhaps through some geometric property.

If points A, C, and B are colinear, then ∠ACD + ∠DCB = 180°, as before, leading to:

127 -5x + 68 = 180 → 195 -5x = 180 → 5x = 15 → x = 3. Not an option.

But if points A, C, and B are not colinear, then ∠ACD and ∠DCB are not supplementary. Let's say that ∠ACD = θ, then θ + 68 = something, but we don't know.

Wait, but if we consider that ∠ACD is part of triangle ABC, and if we can find another angle in triangle ABC, but we don't have enough info.

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involving point E where ∠BEC = y². If we can relate y² to other angles.

But since we don't have any info about y, perhaps there's a way to eliminate it. For example, if ∠BEC is an angle in a triangle where other angles are known in terms of x.

But without knowing where E is, it's hard to say. Perhaps E is on a certain line, like BC or AB.

Wait, let's assume that E is on BC, making ∠BEC an angle at E between B and C. If E is on BC, then ∠BEC would be a straight angle, which is 180°, but that would make y² = 180°, which is not helpful.

Alternatively, if E is inside the triangle, then ∠BEC would be an internal angle, but without knowing its location, it's hard.

At this point, I'm stuck. Let me try to see if there's another way. Maybe the answer is 34, which is option B. Let me test x=34.

If x=34, then:

∠DBC = 3x -15 = 3*34 -15 = 102 -15 = 87°

∠DCB = 68°

So in triangle DBC, angles are 87°, 68°, and 180 - 87 -68 = 25°, so ∠BDC = 25°.

Then, assuming ∠ADC is supplementary to ∠BDC, so ∠ADC = 180 - 25 = 155°.

In triangle ADC, angles are:

∠DAC = 2x = 68°

∠ADC = 155°

So the remaining angle ∠ACD = 180 - 68 -155 = -43°, which is impossible. So x=34 is invalid.

Next, try x=30 (option A):

∠DBC = 3*30 -15 = 90 -15 = 75°

∠DCB = 68°

So ∠BDC = 180 -75 -68 = 37°

∠ADC = 180 -37 = 143°

In triangle ADC:

∠DAC = 60°

∠ADC = 143°

∠ACD = 180 -60 -143 = -23° → Invalid.

Next, x=60 (option C):

∠DBC = 3*60 -15 = 180 -15 = 165°

∠DCB = 68°

∠BDC = 180 -165 -68 = -53° → Invalid.

x=68 (option D):

∠DBC = 3*68 -15 = 204 -15 = 189°, which is greater than 180°, impossible.

None of these work. So what's wrong here?

Wait, perhaps my assumption about ∠ADC being supplementary to ∠BDC is incorrect. Maybe they are not supplementary. What if they are not supplementary, and I need to find another way.

Let me think: If D is not on AB, but somewhere else, then ∠BDC and ∠ADC are separate angles at D, and their sum is not necessarily 180°. So, perhaps there's another relationship.

Wait, but without knowing the position of D, it's hard to say. Maybe there's a different approach.

Wait, let's look at all the given angles again. We have ∠DAC = 2x, ∠DBC = 3x -15, ∠DCB = 68°, and ∠BEC = y². Maybe there's a way to use the fact that the sum of angles around a point or in a triangle.

Wait, if we consider triangle ABC, and points D and E inside it. Let's say D is inside the triangle, and E is also inside. Then, there might be several angles.

But without knowing where D and E are, it's challenging.

Wait, let's try to think about the angles at point D. If there are multiple angles at D, like ∠ADC and ∠BDC, and possibly others, but we only know ∠BDC from triangle DBC.

Alternatively, if there's a straight line through D, making ∠ADC and ∠BDC supplementary, but earlier that led to contradictions.

Wait, but if I drop that assumption, and instead consider that there's another angle at D, say, ∠ADB, which is part of another triangle.

But without more info, it's hard to proceed.

At this point, I'm stuck. Given that all my approaches lead to inconsistencies, perhaps I made a fundamental error in interpreting the angle notations.

Wait, let me double-check the angle notations. The predicate is MeasureOf(Angle(D, A, C)). Standard notation for angle ABC is the angle at point B between points A and C. So Angle(D, A, C) is the angle at point A between points D and C. So ∠DAC, as I originally thought.

Similarly, Angle(B, E, C) is the angle at point E between B and C, so ∠BEC.

Angle(D, B, C) is the angle at point B between D and C, so ∠DBC.

Angle(D, C, B) is the angle at point C between D and B, so ∠DCB.

So the interpretations are correct.

Given that, and the earlier calculations leading to x=3, which is not an option, and testing other options not working, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the earlier steps.

Let me recheck the calculation where I assumed that ∠ACD + ∠DCB = 180°, leading to x=3.

If ∠ACD = 127 -5x, and ∠DCB = 68°, then:

127 -5x + 68 = 180 → 195 -5x = 180 → 5x = 15 → x=3.

But if this is incorrect, maybe ∠ACD is not 127 -5x. Let me re-express ∠ACD.

In triangle ADC, ∠DAC = 2x, ∠ADC = 53 + 3x, so ∠ACD = 180 - 2x - (53 + 3x) = 180 -5x -53 = 127 -5x. Correct.

So if ∠ACD + ∠DCB = 180°, then x=3, which is not an option. But since this leads to inconsistency, perhaps the assumption that ∠ACD + ∠DCB = 180° is wrong.

What if ∠ACD is not supplementary to ∠DCB? Maybe they are part of the same angle, or something else.

Wait, if points A, C, and B are not colinear, then ∠ACD and ∠DCB are separate angles at point C, and their sum is not necessarily 180°. So, if we cannot assume that, then we have no way to relate ∠ACD to ∠DCB. Hence, this approach is blocked.

At this point, I'm stuck. Given that all paths lead to dead ends, perhaps there's a different interpretation of the problem. Let me try to think outside the box.

Maybe the angles given are part of a cyclic quadrilateral, or some other figure. For example, if points A, B, C, D lie on a circle, then we could use cyclic quadrilateral properties.

But without knowing if it's cyclic, this is speculation. Let's try.

If ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral, then opposite angles sum to 180°. But we have angles at D and C, but not sure.

Alternatively, if ∠DAC and ∠DBC are related through some cyclic property.

But this is too vague.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the angles at point C (68° and ∠ACD) are part of a triangle where we can use the law of sines or cosines. But without side lengths, this is impossible.

Alternatively, if there's a triangle where two angles are expressed in terms of x and y, and we can set up an equation.

But without knowing the relationships between the sides, it's not helpful.

Wait, the only other given angle is ∠BEC = y². If this angle is part of a triangle where other angles are known, perhaps in terms of x.

For example, if E is a point such that ∠BEC is an angle in triangle BEC, and if we can express other angles in terms of x.

But without knowing where E is, it's hard to say. However, if we assume that E is on AB, then ∠BEC would be an external angle to triangle ABC, but again, no concrete info.

At this point, I've exhausted all avenues I can think of, and none lead to a valid x value among the options. Given that, maybe there's a miscalculation I missed.

Let me try one last time, assuming that the angle at D (127 -3x) is equal to ∠DAC = 2x. So:

127 -3x = 2x → 127 = 5x → x = 25.4, not an option.

Or, if ∠BDC = ∠DAC, so 127 -3x = 2x → x=127/5=25.4, same.

Nope.

Alternatively, if ∠ACD = ∠BDC, so 127 -5x = 127 -3x → -5x = -3x → x=0, invalid.

No.

Wait, what if there's a typo in the problem, and one of the predicates is different? For example, maybe ∠BEC = y, not y². But that's speculation.

Alternatively, maybe the given angle measures are in degrees, and some of them are supplementary or complementary.

Wait, if ∠BEC = y², and if it's a right angle, then y² = 90 → y=√90, but this doesn't help.

Alternatively, if ∠BEC is supplementary to ∠DAC, so y² + 2x = 180. But without knowing y, this is still two variables.

At this point, I'm forced to conclude that either there's missing information, or I've misunderstood the diagram. Given the answer choices, and the fact that x=34 is option B, let me try to see if there's a way to get x=34.

Let's assume x=34, then:

∠DBC = 3*34 -15 = 102 -15 = 87°

∠DCB = 68°

So in triangle DBC, angles are 87°, 68°, and 180 - 87 -68 = 25°, so ∠BDC = 25°.
