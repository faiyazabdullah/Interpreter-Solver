<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have several given predicates here. Let me start by listing them out again to make sure I don't miss anything.

First, there are two triangles mentioned: Triangle(E,C,F) and Triangle(A,B,C). Then there are some equality conditions involving angles and lengths. 

The first angle measure is Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(E,C,F)), x), so we need to find x, which is the measure of angle at point C in triangle ECF. 

Then, the lengths: Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,C)), 12) and Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C)), 15). So EC is 12 units, AC is 15 units. 

Next, Equals(Angle(C,F,E), Angle(A,C,D)). Wait, angle CFE equals angle ACD? But where is point D? Hmm, maybe it's part of another triangle or construction. Also, Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,F)), LengthOf(Line(C,D))). So CF equals CD. 

Then, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(F,C,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,A))). So angle FCE equals angle BCA. And finally, Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,H)), LengthOf(Line(B,C))). So CH equals BC. 

Hmm, okay. Let's try to visualize this. Maybe drawing a diagram would help, but since I can't draw, I'll have to imagine it. 

Starting with triangle ECF. Points E, C, F. EC is 12. Then triangle ABC, points A, B, C. AC is 15. 

Angle at C in triangle ECF (angle ECF) is equal to angle at C in triangle ABC (angle BCA). Wait, no: the second angle equality says MeasureOf(Angle(F,C,E)) equals MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,A)). Wait, angle FCE is angle at C between FC and CE, which would be the same as angle ECF. And angle BCA is angle at C between BC and CA. So these two angles are equal. 

Also, CF equals CD. So CF = CD. And angle CFE equals angle ACD. So angle at F in triangle ECF (angle CFE) equals angle ACD. 

Additionally, CH equals BC. Not sure where H is yet. 

So maybe triangles ECF and something else are similar? Since they share angles? Let me think. 

Let me note down the given equal angles and sides. 

From the given:

- In triangle ECF, EC = 12, CF = CD (so CF is equal to CD), and angle FCE equals angle BCA. Also, angle CFE equals angle ACD. 

Wait, perhaps triangles ECF and ACD are similar? Because if two angles are equal, then the third must also be equal, making them similar. 

But wait, angle CFE (which is angle at F in ECF) equals angle ACD. And angle FCE equals angle BCA. So maybe triangle ECF ~ triangle ACD? 

Wait, let's check the angles. For similarity, two angles being equal would suffice. 

In triangle ECF: angles at C (FCE), at F (CFE), and at E. 

In triangle ACD: angles at C (ACD), at D, and at A. 

Given angle FCE = angle BCA (which is angle at C in triangle ABC). Also, angle CFE = angle ACD. So if those two angles correspond, then triangles ECF and ACD would be similar. 

Therefore, triangle ECF ~ triangle ACD by AA similarity. 

Since they are similar, corresponding sides are proportional. 

So EC / AC = CF / CD = EF / AD. But wait, CF equals CD, so CF / CD is 1. Therefore, EC / AC should be 1? But EC is 12 and AC is 15. That would mean 12/15 = 4/5, which isn't 1. Contradiction? Wait, maybe my correspondence is wrong. 

Alternatively, maybe triangle ECF is similar to triangle CDA? Let me check. 

If angle FCE corresponds to angle ACD (since angle FCE = angle BCA, which is part of angle ACD?), not sure. 

Wait, angle CFE equals angle ACD. So angle at F in ECF equals angle at C in ACD. And angle at C in ECF equals angle BCA. 

Wait, perhaps triangle ECF is similar to triangle CBA? Let me see. 

If angle FCE equals angle BCA (let's call that angle θ), and angle CFE equals angle CAB (if there's such a relation)? Not sure. 

Alternatively, since EC=12 and AC=15, and maybe other sides relate via similar triangles. 

Wait, let's consider the Law of Sines in triangle ECF. 

In triangle ECF: 

EC / sin(angle CFE) = CF / sin(angle E) = EF / sin(angle FCE)

Similarly, in triangle ABC: 

AC / sin(angle ABC) = AB / sin(angle BCA) = BC / sin(angle BAC)

But not sure how that connects. 

Wait, we know that angle FCE equals angle BCA. Let me denote angle BCA as θ. So angle FCE is θ. Also, angle CFE equals angle ACD. Let me think about triangle ACD. Since CD equals CF, maybe triangle CFD is isoceles? Or something else. 

Wait, CF equals CD. So triangle CFD has CF = CD. Therefore, angles opposite those sides are equal. But I'm not sure where D is located. Maybe D is a point such that CD = CF, so D lies somewhere such that CD = CF. 

Alternatively, since angle CFE equals angle ACD, and CF = CD, maybe triangle CFE is similar to triangle CDA? 

Wait, angle CFE = angle ACD (given), and angle FCE = angle BCA (given). If those two angles correspond, then maybe triangles CFE and CDA are similar. 

Let me write down:

In triangle CFE and triangle CDA:

- angle at C (FCE) equals angle at C (BCA) → angle CFE (in CFE) equals angle ACD (in CDA). Wait, maybe the correspondence is different. 

Wait, angle CFE is in triangle CFE, which is equal to angle ACD. So if we have triangle CFE and triangle ACD, then angle at F (CFE) equals angle at C (ACD). Also, angle at C (FCE) equals angle at B (BCA). Wait, not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe triangle ECF is similar to triangle BCA? Let me check. 

If angle FCE (θ) equals angle BCA (θ), and angle CFE equals angle BAC? If that were true, then yes. But do we know that? 

We have angle CFE equals angle ACD. How does angle ACD relate to angle BAC? 

Not sure. Maybe need more relations. 

Alternatively, let's look at the length ratios. 

We know EC = 12, AC = 15. Suppose there is a ratio between these. If triangles ECF and some other triangle have sides in proportion. 

Wait, if triangle ECF ~ triangle ACD, then EC / AC = CF / CD. But CF = CD, so that ratio is 1, implying EC = AC, but EC is 12 and AC is 15, which contradicts. So that can't be. 

Hmm, maybe the similarity is between ECF and something else. 

Wait, angle FCE equals angle BCA (θ). Also, angle CFE equals angle ACD. Let me think about triangle ACD. Since CD = CF, then triangle CDF is isoceles with CF = CD. Therefore, angles at D and F are equal. Wait, but angle at C is angle FCD. 

Wait, maybe angle ACD is equal to angle CFE. Let me consider triangle ACD. If CD = CF, then angle CFD equals angle CDF. Wait, but I don't know where D is. 

This seems too vague without knowing where points D and H are. Maybe there's a way to use the Law of Cosines in triangle ECF? 

In triangle ECF, we know EC = 12, CF = CD (but CD's length is unknown), and angle at C is θ (equal to angle BCA). Also, angle at F is equal to angle ACD. 

Alternatively, considering triangle ABC. We know AC = 15. If we can relate angle BCA (θ) with other parts. 

Wait, maybe triangle ABC and triangle ECF have some relationship. Let me think. 

Suppose we apply Law of Cosines in triangle ECF. Let me denote:

In triangle ECF:

EC = 12, CF = let's say 'a', and EF is some length. 

Angle at C is θ, angle at F is φ (equal to angle ACD), angle at E is ψ. 

So θ + φ + ψ = 180 degrees. 

In triangle ABC, angle at C is θ. 

But without knowing other sides or angles, it's hard to proceed. 

Wait, but maybe we can relate the triangles using the Law of Sines. 

In triangle ECF:

EC / sin(φ) = CF / sin(ψ) = EF / sin(θ)

In triangle ABC:

AC / sin(angle ABC) = BC / sin(θ) = AB / sin(angle BAC)

But unless we have more info about angles or sides, it's difficult. 

Wait, but we also have that angle CFE equals angle ACD. Let's consider triangle ACD. 

Point D is connected to C and D, with CD = CF. So CD is equal to CF, which is a side in triangle ECF. 

If we consider triangle ACD, which includes angle ACD (equal to angle CFE), and CD = CF. 

Maybe triangles ECF and ACD have some relation. 

Wait, suppose we consider triangle ACD. If angle ACD = angle CFE (from the given), and CD = CF, and angle at C (for triangle ECF) is θ. 

If we can find another angle relationship... 

Alternatively, since angle FCE = angle BCA = θ, and angle CFE = angle ACD. 

If we can express angle ACD in terms of other angles. 

In triangle ABC, angle at C is θ, so angle BCA = θ. Then angle ACD could be part of that angle? Like, if D is a point extending from C, then angle ACD might be a portion of angle BCA? Or maybe not. 

Alternatively, if D is a point such that CD = CF and angle ACD = angle CFE, then maybe triangle ACD relates to triangle ECF somehow. 

This is getting complicated. Let me try to think differently. 

We need to find x, which is the measure of angle ECF (since MeasureOf(Angle(E,C,F)) is angle at C in triangle ECF, which is angle ECF). 

Earlier, I thought that angle ECF equals angle BCA (θ), and maybe there's a way to find θ from triangle ABC. 

But we don't have enough info about triangle ABC. However, maybe there's another relation. 

Wait, we also have that CH equals BC. So CH = BC. Where is H? Maybe H is a point along some line? 

Without knowing where H is, it's hard to say. But maybe H is related to other points. 

Alternatively, maybe triangle BCH is isoceles? Since CH = BC. 

But again, without knowing where H is, it's unclear. 

Perhaps focusing back on the triangles. Let me try to consider triangle ECF and triangle BCA. 

If angle ECF = angle BCA (both are θ), and maybe another angle relation. 

For example, if angle CFE equals angle BAC. 

Wait, angle CFE is equal to angle ACD. If angle ACD is related to angle BAC? 

In triangle ABC, angles sum to 180. So angle BAC + angle ABC + angle BCA = 180. 

If we can find relations between these angles... 

Alternatively, since we have two triangles with one angle equal (θ), maybe using the Law of Sines in both. 

In triangle ECF:

EC / sin(angle CFE) = CF / sin(angle E)

In triangle ABC:

AC / sin(angle ABC) = BC / sin(theta)

But without more info, it's still stuck. 

Wait, but we have another condition: angle CFE = angle ACD. 

Let me assume that angle ACD is part of triangle ACD. Since CD = CF, triangle ACD has sides CD = CF. 

If I can find some relation between triangle ACD and others. 

Alternatively, since angle CFE equals angle ACD, and angle ECF equals angle BCA, perhaps there's a way to set up proportions. 

Let me try to think of triangle ECF and triangle ACD. 

Assume that triangle ECF ~ triangle ACD. Then:

EC / AC = CF / CD = EF / AD. 

But CF = CD, so CF / CD = 1. Hence, EC / AC = 1 => EC = AC. But EC is 12, AC is 15. This is impossible. So the assumption of similarity is incorrect. 

Hmm. So maybe the similarity is between different triangles. 

Alternatively, triangle ECF and triangle BCA. 

If angle ECF = angle BCA (θ), and if another pair of angles are equal. 

Suppose angle CFE = angle BAC. Then triangles ECF and BCA would be similar by AA. 

If that's true, then EC / BC = CF / BA = EF / CA. 

But we don't know BC or BA. 

But we also know that CH = BC. If H is a point such that CH = BC, perhaps there's a way to relate. 

Wait, maybe triangle BCH is isoceles with CH = BC, so angles at B and H are equal? 

But again, without knowing where H is, it's hard to proceed. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to use the fact that CF = CD. Let me think. 

Since CF = CD, and angle CFE = angle ACD. Let me consider triangle CFD. Since CF = CD, it's isoceles with base FD. Therefore, angles at F and D are equal. So angle CFD = angle CDF. 

But angle CFE is equal to angle ACD. Let me denote angle CFE as φ. So angle ACD = φ. 

In triangle CFD, angle at F is φ, and angle at D is also φ. Therefore, angle at C is 180 - 2φ. 

But angle at C in triangle CFD is angle FCD, which is part of angle FCE in triangle ECF. 

Wait, angle FCE is θ (as per earlier). So angle FCD is part of angle FCE? 

If D is on the extension of CE or something, then angle FCD would be part of angle FCE. 

Assuming that, then angle FCD = angle FCE - angle DCE. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, if D is positioned such that CD is a continuation of some line. 

This is getting too abstract. Maybe I need to take a different approach. 

Let me focus on finding x, which is angle ECF (θ). 

We know in triangle ECF, we have sides EC = 12, CF = CD (unknown), and angle at C is θ. 

If we can find another relation involving θ, maybe through triangle ABC. 

In triangle ABC, AC = 15, angle at C is θ. 

But we need more info about triangle ABC. Unless there's a way to connect it with other parts. 

Wait, angle CFE = angle ACD. If I can express angle ACD in terms of other angles. 

In triangle ABC, angle BCA is θ. If point D is such that CD = CF and angle ACD = angle CFE, then angle ACD is some part of angle BCA. 

But without knowing where D is, it's challenging. 

Wait, maybe using the Law of Cosines in triangle ECF. Let's assume that we can find EF in terms of other variables. 

But without knowing EF or CF, it's hard. 

Wait, but maybe using the fact that in triangle ABC, AC = 15, and if we can relate to triangle ECF through some proportion. 

Alternatively, since angle CFE = angle ACD and CF = CD, maybe there's an isoceles triangle involved. 

Let me think: In triangle ACD, CD = CF, so it's isoceles with legs CD and CF. Wait, but CD is a leg, CF is another leg? No, CD is a side, CF is another side. Wait, triangle ACD has sides AC, CD, and AD. But CD = CF. 

But I don't know the length of CF. 

Wait, but in triangle ECF, EC = 12, CF is unknown, and angle at C is θ. 

Is there a way to relate this to triangle ABC? 

If we can find the length of BC, since we have CH = BC. 

But again, without knowing where H is, it's tricky. 

Alternatively, maybe triangle BCH is isoceles with CH = BC, so BH is the base. But without more info, I can't proceed. 

This seems like a dead end. Let me go back to the beginning and see if I missed any key relationships. 

Given that angle CFE = angle ACD, and CF = CD. So angle CFE = angle ACD, and CF = CD. 

This suggests that triangle CFE and triangle CDA may be congruent or similar. 

Wait, if CF = CD, and angle CFE = angle ACD, and angle FCE = angle BCA, maybe there's a way to use ASA or SAS for congruence. 

But I need to establish some sides or angles. 

For example, in triangle CFE and triangle CDA: 

- CF = CD (given)
- angle CFE = angle ACD (given)
- angle FCE = angle BCA (given)

Wait, but angle FCE is at point C in triangle CFE, and angle BCA is at point C in triangle ABC. Are these angles the same? 

Yes, because angle FCE is the same as angle BCA if points are arranged properly. 

Wait, if angle FCE is equal to angle BCA, and angle CFE equals angle ACD, then maybe triangles CFE and CDA are similar? 

Because they have two angles equal: angle at C (θ) and angle at F (φ). 

So triangle CFE ~ triangle CDA by AA similarity. 

Thus, the ratio of sides would be:

CF / CD = CE / DA = FE / CA. 

But CF = CD, so CF/CD = 1. Thus, CE / DA = 1 ⇒ CE = DA. 

So DA = CE = 12. 

But DA is a segment from D to A. Not sure how that helps yet. 

But we also know that in triangle ABC, AC = 15. 

If DA = 12, and AC = 15, then maybe there's a way to relate these. 

But without knowing where D is, it's still ambiguous. 

Wait, but if DA = 12 and AC = 15, then maybe triangle DAC has sides DA = 12, AC = 15, and DC = CF. 

But DC is equal to CF, which is a side in triangle ECF. 

But I don't know CF's length. 

However, if we can apply the Law of Cosines in triangle ECF. 

In triangle ECF, sides are EC = 12, CF = ?, and EF = ?. Angle at C is θ. 

Using Law of Cosines:

EF² = EC² + CF² - 2*EC*CF*cos(θ)

But we don't know EF or CF. 

But if we can relate this to triangle DAC. 

In triangle DAC, sides are DA = 12, AC = 15, and DC = CF. 

Applying Law of Cosines here:

DC² = DA² + AC² - 2*DA*AC*cos(angle DAC)

But angle DAC is...? 

Wait, angle at A in triangle DAC. 

But I don't know angle DAC. 

Alternatively, since triangle CFE ~ triangle CDA, then their sides are proportional. 

As before, since CF/CD = 1, then EC/DA = 1, so DA = EC = 12. 

And also, FE/CA = 1 ⇒ FE = CA = 15. 

So FE = 15. 

Now, in triangle ECF, FE = 15, EC = 12, CF = ? 

Applying Law of Cosines to triangle ECF:

FE² = EC² + CF² - 2*EC*CF*cos(θ)

Substituting FE = 15, EC = 12:

15² = 12² + CF² - 2*12*CF*cos(θ)

Which simplifies to:

225 = 144 + CF² - 24*CF*cos(θ)

Rearranged:

CF² - 24*CF*cos(θ) + 144 - 225 = 0

CF² - 24*CF*cos(θ) - 81 = 0

But we still have two unknowns: CF and cos(θ). 

Hmm, not helpful yet. 

But maybe we can find another equation involving CF and θ. 

Looking at triangle DAC, which has DA = 12, AC = 15, DC = CF. 

Applying Law of Cosines here:

CF² = DA² + AC² - 2*DA*AC*cos(angle DAC)

But angle DAC is angle at A in triangle DAC. 

But angle DAC is related to other angles. 

Wait, angle DAC is angle between DA and AC. If we can relate this to other parts. 

Alternatively, since triangle CFE ~ triangle CDA, the angles are equal. So angle at F in CFE corresponds to angle at D in CDA. 

But angle at F in CFE is φ (angle CFE), which equals angle ACD. 

But angle at D in CDA is angle ADC. 

So angle ADC = angle CFE = φ. 

But I don't know how that helps. 

Alternatively, since triangle CFE ~ triangle CDA, the ratio of sides is 1, so they are congruent? Wait, if all sides are in ratio 1, then they are congruent. 

But if they're congruent, then CF = CD (which is given), EC = DA (which we found DA = 12), and FE = CA (which gives FE = 15). 

So triangle CFE ≅ triangle CDA. 

Therefore, all corresponding sides are equal. 

So CF = CD, EC = DA = 12, FE = CA = 15. 

So that means DA = 12, and DA is a segment from D to A. 

But how does this help us find θ?

Well, in triangle ECF, we have sides EC = 12, CF = CD, FE = 15. 

So in triangle ECF, sides are 12, CF, and 15. 

But we need to find angle θ at C. 

Using the Law of Cosines in triangle ECF:

FE² = EC² + CF² - 2*EC*CF*cos(θ)

We have FE = 15, EC = 12, CF = ?

But we don't know CF. However, in triangle DAC, we have DA = 12, AC = 15, and DC = CF. 

Applying Law of Cosines to triangle DAC:

DC² = DA² + AC² - 2*DA*AC*cos(angle DAC)

But DC = CF, DA = 12, AC = 15. 

So CF² = 12² + 15² - 2*12*15*cos(angle DAC)

But angle DAC is the same as angle at A in triangle DAC, which is angle between DA and AC. 

But how does this relate to other angles? 

Alternatively, since triangle CFE ~ triangle CDA, angle at C in CFE (θ) corresponds to angle at C in CDA. Wait, no, because in triangle CDA, angle at C is angle ACD, which is equal to angle CFE (φ). 

Wait, earlier, we had angle CFE = angle ACD. 

So in triangle CDA, angle at C is φ, and in triangle CFE, angle at F is φ. 

But since triangles CFE and CDA are congruent, angle at F in CFE (φ) corresponds to angle at D in CDA (φ). 

So angle at D in CDA is φ. 

But I'm going in circles. 

Wait, let's return to the Law of Cosines equations. 

From triangle ECF: 

15² = 12² + CF² - 2*12*CF*cos(θ)

From triangle DAC: 

CF² = 12² + 15² - 2*12*15*cos(angle DAC)

But angle DAC is angle at A in triangle DAC. 

But angle DAC is part of triangle ABC? If D is a point such that CD = CF, and DA = 12, then maybe angle DAC is related to other angles in triangle ABC. 

Alternatively, since DA = 12 and AC = 15, and angle at A is angle DAC, which might be related to angle BAC. 

But without knowing more about triangle ABC, it's hard to say. 

Wait, but we also know that angle CFE = angle ACD. And angle CFE is φ, which in triangle CFE is angle at F. 

Since triangle CFE ~ triangle CDA, angle at F (φ) corresponds to angle at D (φ). 

But this doesn't give new info. 

Maybe we need to consider that in triangle ECF, we have two sides and the included angle? No, we only know one side (EC=12) and the angle θ. 

Wait, but we also know that FE = 15. So in triangle ECF, we have two sides: EC = 12, FE = 15, and angle between them is at E? No, the angle at C is θ. 

Wait, no. In triangle ECF, the sides are EC = 12, CF = ?, and FE = 15. The angle between EC and CF is θ. 

So applying the Law of Cosines:

FE² = EC² + CF² - 2*EC*CF*cos(θ)

Which is 15² = 12² + CF² - 2*12*CF*cos(θ)

But we also have from triangle DAC: 

CF² = 12² + 15² - 2*12*15*cos(angle DAC)

But angle DAC is unknown. 

Unless angle DAC is equal to angle BAC? 

If D is placed such that DA is aligned with some part of triangle ABC, maybe angle DAC is equal to angle BAC? 

If that's the case, then angle DAC = angle BAC. 

But without knowing where D is, it's uncertain. 

But assuming that, then in triangle DAC, angle at A is angle BAC, and in triangle ABC, angle at A is also angle BAC. 

So, using that assumption, we can write:

CF² = 12² + 15² - 2*12*15*cos(angle BAC)

But in triangle ABC, using the Law of Cosines:

BC² = AB² + AC² - 2*AB*AC*cos(angle BAC)

But we don't know BC or AB. 

However, we also have that CH = BC. So if H is a point such that CH = BC, maybe there's a relation. 

But I'm stuck here. 

Let me try to think numerically. Let's suppose that angle θ is x, and try to find x. 

From triangle ECF, using Law of Cosines:

15² = 12² + CF² - 2*12*CF*cos(x)

From triangle DAC, CF² = 12² + 15² - 2*12*15*cos(angle DAC)

But angle DAC = angle BAC. 

In triangle ABC, using Law of Cosines:

BC² = AB² + 15² - 2*AB*15*cos(angle BAC)

But we don't know AB or BC. 

However, we also have CH = BC. 

If we assume that H is a point such that CH = BC, maybe forming another triangle or something. 

But without knowing where H is, it's hard to proceed. 

Maybe there's a property I'm missing. 

Wait, let's recall that in triangle ECF, we have FE = 15 (from similarity), and EC = 12. So in triangle ECF, sides are 12, CF, and 15. 

If we can find CF using the Law of Cosines, but we need to know angle x. Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines. 

Law of Sines in triangle ECF:

sin(x)/FE = sin(angle at E)/CF = sin(angle at F)/EC

But we don't know angles at E or F. 

But angle at F is φ, which is equal to angle ACD. 

And angle at E is 180 - x - φ. 

But again, not helpful. 

Wait, but from the earlier assumption that triangles CFE and CDA are congruent, then CF = CD, and DA = 12, so DA = EC = 12. 

So DA = 12, AC = 15. So in triangle DAC, sides DA = 12, AC = 15, and DC = CF. 

So using Law of Cosines in triangle DAC:

CF² = 12² + 15² - 2*12*15*cos(angle DAC)

But angle DAC is angle at A, which is part of triangle ABC. 

If we can relate angle DAC to angle BAC, then maybe we can find something. 

But without more info, it's still stuck. 

Wait, maybe angle DAC is supplementary to angle BAC? Or something like that. 

Alternatively, if D is a point such that CD = CF and DA = 12, then maybe there's a way to relate it to triangle ABC. 

But I'm running out of ideas. Let me try plugging in the answer choices. 

The options are A. 6, B. 8, C. 12, D. 15. 

Let's assume x is one of these and see if it fits. 

Let's try x = 90 degrees. Wait, but 90 isn't an option. 

Wait, the options are 6, 8, 12, 15. 

Let me try x = 60 degrees. 

Using Law of Cosines in triangle ECF:

15² = 12² + CF² - 2*12*CF*cos(60°)

cos(60°) = 0.5

So:

225 = 144 + CF² - 12*CF

=> CF² - 12CF + 144 - 225 = 0

CF² - 12CF - 81 = 0

Solving quadratic equation:

CF = [12 ± sqrt(144 + 324)] / 2 = [12 ± sqrt(468)] / 2 = [12 ± 6*sqrt(13)] / 2 = 6 ± 3√13

Positive root: 6 + 3√13 ≈ 6 + 10.816 = 16.816

But then, in triangle DAC, CF² = 12² + 15² - 2*12*15*cos(angle DAC)

CF² = (approx) (16.816)^2 ≈ 282.77

On the other hand, 12² + 15² = 144 + 225 = 369

So 369 - 2*12*15*cos(angle DAC) = 282.77

So 2*12*15*cos(angle DAC) = 369 - 282.77 = 86.23

cos(angle DAC) = 86.23 / 360 = approx 0.2395

So angle DAC ≈ 72.5 degrees. 

But this doesn't directly help. 

Try x = 8 (option B). 

cos(8°) ≈ 0.9903

So:

225 = 144 + CF² - 2*12*CF*0.9903

225 - 144 = CF² - 23.76CF

81 = CF² - 23.76CF

CF² - 23.76CF - 81 = 0

Solution: CF = [23.76 ± sqrt((23.76)^2 + 324)] / 2

Calculate discriminant: 564.5 + 324 = 888.5

sqrt(888.5) ≈ 29.81

CF ≈ (23.76 + 29.81)/2 ≈ 53.57/2 ≈ 26.785

Then, in triangle DAC, CF² = 26.785^2 ≈ 717.4

On the other hand, 12^2 + 15^2 = 369

So 369 - 2*12*15*cos(angle DAC) = 717.4 → 369 - 360*cos(angle DAC) = 717.4 → -360*cos(angle DAC) = 348.4 → cos(angle DAC) ≈ -348.4 / 360 ≈ -0.9678

Which implies angle DAC ≈ 165 degrees. 

This seems unlikely, but mathematically possible. 

But without knowing if this leads to consistency, it's hard to say. 

Try x = 60 degrees, but it didn't help. 

Alternatively, let's assume that triangle ECF is a right triangle. 

If x is 90 degrees, then:

FE² = EC² + CF²

But FE = 15, EC = 12, so 15² = 12² + CF² → CF² = 225 - 144 = 81 → CF = 9.

Then, in triangle DAC, CF = 9, DA = 12, AC = 15. 

Apply Law of Cosines:

CF² = DA² + AC² - 2*DA*AC*cos(angle DAC)

81 = 144 + 225 - 2*12*15*cos(angle DAC)

81 = 369 - 360*cos(angle DAC)

→ 360*cos(angle DAC) = 369 - 81 = 288

→ cos(angle DAC) = 288/360 = 0.8 → angle DAC = arccos(0.8) ≈ 36.87 degrees.

This is possible. 

But x was assumed to be 90 degrees, which isn't an option. 

But maybe there's a mistake in assuming that. 

Wait, the options are 6, 8, 12, 15. 

Let me try x = 60 degrees, but as before, it led to CF ≈ 16.816. 

Alternatively, let's think about the possibility that x is such that triangle ECF is a 12-15-? triangle with angle x. 

But without more info, it's hard. 

Wait, but earlier, we had from the similarity that triangle CFE ~ triangle CDA, leading to FE = CA = 15. 

So in triangle ECF, FE = 15, EC = 12, CF = ?. 

If we use the Law of Cosines in triangle ECF:

15² = 12² + CF² - 2*12*CF*cos(x)

But also, from triangle DAC, CF² = 12² + 15² - 2*12*15*cos(angle DAC)

But angle DAC is related to angle BAC. 

If we assume that angle DAC = angle BAC, then in triangle ABC, using Law of Cosines:

BC² = AB² + 15² - 2*AB*15*cos(angle BAC)

But we also have CH = BC. 

But without knowing AB or BC, it's still not helpful. 

Wait, but if we can relate CF to BC? 

Since CF = CD, and CH = BC. 

If D is a point such that CD = CF and H is a point such that CH = BC, maybe there's a relation. 

But without knowing the position of D and H, it's hard to say. 

This problem is really challenging. Maybe I'm missing a key insight. 

Wait, let me revisit the initial assumptions. 

I assumed that triangles CFE and CDA are similar, leading to FE = CA = 15. But why is that? 

Because if two angles are equal, then the triangles are similar. 

Angle at C (θ) in CFE equals angle at C (θ) in CDA? No, angle at C in CFE is θ, and angle at C in CDA is angle ACD, which equals angle CFE (φ). 

Wait, no. Earlier, I said that angle CFE (in CFE) equals angle ACD (in CDA). And angle FCE (in CFE) equals angle BCA (θ). 

So in triangle CFE, angles are θ (at C), φ (at F), and 180 - θ - φ (at E). 

In triangle CDA, angles are φ (at C), φ (at D), and 180 - 2φ (at A). 

Wait, no. If angle at C in CDA is φ (angle ACD), and angle at D is φ (because CD = CF, so triangle CDA has angles at D and F?) No, triangle CDA has sides CD, DA, and AC. 

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier in assuming similarity. Let me re-express the angles. 

In triangle CFE: 
- angle at C: θ (FCE)
- angle at F: φ (CFE)
- angle at E: 180 - θ - φ

In triangle CDA:
- angle at C: φ (ACD)
- angle at D: ?
- angle at A: ?

But unless there's another angle equality, they aren't necessarily similar. 

But earlier, I thought that angle at F in CFE (φ) equals angle at C in CDA (φ), and angle at C in CFE (θ) equals angle at A in CDA? No, not sure. 

This is getting too tangled. 

Maybe I should consider using vectors or coordinate geometry. 

Let me place point C at the origin (0,0). 

Let me assign coordinates to simplify. 

Let’s set point C at (0,0). 

Let’s assume that line CE is along the positive x-axis. So point E is at (12, 0), since EC = 12. 

Now, we need to find coordinates of F such that angle at C (FCE) is θ, and CF = CD. 

But I don't know where D is. 

Alternatively, since angle CFE = angle ACD, and angle FCE = angle BCA. 

But this requires knowing more about points A, B, D, and H. 

This might be too complex without more info. 

Wait, but maybe focusing on triangle ECF and using the given lengths. 

We know EC = 12, and we need to find θ. 

If we can find another side or angle in triangle ECF. 

But we only know one side (EC) and one angle (θ). 

Wait, but we also know that in triangle ABC, AC = 15, and angle at C is θ. 

If we can relate these two triangles. 

Maybe using the Law of Sines in both triangles. 

In triangle ECF: 

EC / sin(angle at F) = CF / sin(angle at E) = FE / sin(θ)

In triangle ABC: 

AC / sin(angle at B) = BC / sin(θ) = AB / sin(angle at A)

But without knowing other angles or sides, it's still not helpful. 

But if we can link the two. 

For example, if angle at F in ECF (φ) is equal to angle ACD, and angle ACD is part of angle BCA (θ). 

Wait, angle ACD is part of angle BCA? If D is on CB, then angle ACD would be part of angle BCA. 

Assume that D is on CB such that CD = CF. 

If that's the case, then in triangle ABC, CD is a segment from C to D on CB, with CD = CF. 

So, let's say point D is on CB, and CD = CF. 

Then, in triangle ABC, BC = BD + DC = BD + CF. 

But we also have CH = BC. So if H is a point such that CH = BC, maybe H is on some line. 

But this is speculative. 

Assuming D is on CB, then CD = CF. 

So in triangle ABC, BC = BD + CD = BD + CF. 

But without knowing BD or CF, it's still not helpful. 

But if we can express CF in terms of other quantities. 

In triangle ECF, using Law of Cosines: 

FE² = EC² + CF² - 2*EC*CF*cos(θ)

But FE is also related to triangle ABC. 

If FE is a segment from F to E, and E is at (12,0), but I don't know F's coordinates. 

This is getting too complex. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to look for another approach. 

Wait, the answer choices are integers: 6, 8, 12, 15. 

Maybe x is 60 or 90, but not in options. 

Wait, let me try using the Law of Cosines with x = 60. 

As before, CF² - 12CF - 81 = 0 → CF = [12 + sqrt(144 + 324)]/2 = [12 + sqrt(468)]/2 = [12 + 6*sqrt(13)]/2 = 6 + 3*sqrt(13) ≈ 6 + 10.816 = 16.816. 

But then in triangle DAC, CF = 16.816, DA = 12, AC = 15. 

Law of Cosines: 

CF² = 12² + 15² - 2*12*15*cos(angle DAC)

16.816² = 144 + 225 - 360*cos(angle DAC)

282.77 = 369 - 360*cos(angle DAC)

So 360*cos(angle DAC) = 369 - 282.77 = 86.23

cos(angle DAC) = 86.23 / 360 ≈ 0.2395 → angle DAC ≈ 72.5 degrees. 

If this angle is part of triangle ABC, then in triangle ABC, angle at A is 72.5 degrees. 

But without more info, I can't verify. 

Alternatively, let's try x = 8. 

Using Law of Cosines: 

15² = 12² + CF² - 2*12*CF*cos(8°)

225 = 144 + CF² - 23.76CF

CF² - 23.76CF - 81 = 0

CF ≈ (23.76 + sqrt(23.76² + 324))/2 ≈ (23.76 + 29.81)/2 ≈ 26.785

Then, in triangle DAC: CF = 26.785, DA = 12, AC = 15.

CF² = 717.4

12² + 15² = 369

So 369 - 2*12*15*cos(angle DAC) = 717.4 → 369 - 360*cos(angle DAC) = 717.4 → cos(angle DAC) = (369 - 7
