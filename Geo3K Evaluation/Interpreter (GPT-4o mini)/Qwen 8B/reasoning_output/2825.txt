Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a circle P, and there are several points mentioned: J, K, L, M, Q. Let me start by listing all the given predicates to get a clear picture.

First, Circle(P) means there's a circle with center P. Then, Line(M,K) is a diameter of this circle. Also, the length of Line(M,K) is 6 units. Since it's a diameter, the radius would be half of that, so 3 units. That's important because any chord or arc related to this circle will depend on the radius.

Next, there are two right angles: Angle(J,Q,K) and Angle(L,Q,K). Both these angles are right angles. Also, Line(J,L) is perpendicular to Line(M,K). Additionally, Points J, L, K, M all lie on the circle P. And point Q lies on both Line(J,L) and Line(M,K). 

So, putting this together, since J, K, L, M are on the circle, and MK is a diameter. Also, Q is the intersection point of JL and MK. Given that angles at Q are right angles, maybe forming some right triangles here.

Now, the question asks for the measure of arc JL, given that JK is 10 units and the arc JKL measures 134 degrees. Wait, hold on—the problem says "JK = 10" but earlier we had the diameter MK being 6. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, wait, let me check again.

Wait, the user wrote: "In ⊙P, JK = 10 and ∠J KL = 134. Find m∠JL." Wait, maybe I misread. Let me recheck the original problem statement.

Original question: In ⊙P, JK = 10 and ∠JKL = 134. Find m∠JL. Wait, no, the user wrote "Find m ∠JL". But the initial problem mentions "m ∠JL"—probably the measure of arc JL? Or angle JL? Wait, the original problem may have been mistyped. Let me check again.

Looking back, the user wrote: "In ⊙P, JK = 10 and ∠JKL = 134. Find m ∠JL." Wait, perhaps it's supposed to be arc JL? Because angles inside circles often refer to arcs. Alternatively, maybe it's an inscribed angle. But the way it's written, "m∠JL", which usually denotes the measure of angle JL, but that's unclear unless there's a vertex. Maybe it's a typo and should be arc JL?

Alternatively, maybe the question was meant to say that the arc JKL measures 134 degrees, and find the measure of arc JL. But given the original problem has "∠JKL = 134", which is an angle. Hmm.

Wait, looking back at the initial problem statement, the user wrote:

"In ⊙P, J K = 10 and ∠ J K L = 134. Find m ∠ J L."

But the original problem may have had a formatting issue. Let me think. The initial setup includes the predicates like RightAngle(Angle(J,Q,K)) and RightAngle(Angle(L,Q,K)), and Perpendicular(Line(J,L), Line(M,K)). Also, points J, L, K, M lie on the circle. So, maybe the diagram involves points J, K, L, M on the circle, with MK as diameter, and Q as the intersection of JL and MK.

Given that, let's consider the diagram. Since MK is a diameter, and points J and L are also on the circle. Since Q is the intersection of JL and MK, and angles at Q are right angles. So, angles JQK and LQK are right angles. Therefore, Q lies on MK such that when you draw JL, it intersects MK at Q, making those right angles.

Since angles at Q are right angles, then triangles JQM and LQM are right triangles? Wait, no—because Q is on MK, which is a straight line. Let me sketch mentally: MK is a diameter, horizontal for example. JL is a vertical line intersecting MK at Q, forming right angles at Q. So, JL is perpendicular to MK. Hence, JL is perpendicular to the diameter MK. Thus, JL is a chord perpendicular to the diameter MK at point Q. 

In circle geometry, if a chord is perpendicular to a diameter, then the diameter bisects the chord. However, here, since Q is the point where they intersect, and since JL is perpendicular to MK, then Q is the midpoint of JL? Not necessarily, unless the diameter passes through the center. Wait, but MK is the diameter, so its midpoint is the center P. Wait, the center P is the midpoint of MK. Since MK is a diameter, so P is the center. 

But in the given predicates, we have that points J, L, K, M are on the circle. Also, Q lies on both JL and MK. Now, since MK is a diameter, and JL is perpendicular to MK at Q. Therefore, Q is a point on MK where JL meets MK perpendicularly. 

Also, angles at Q are right angles. So, angle JQK and angle LQK are right angles. Therefore, triangles JQK and LQK are right-angled at Q. 

Let me note that since MK is a diameter, then angles subtended by MK would relate to right angles. For instance, any triangle inscribed in a semicircle is a right triangle. But here, points J and L are on the circle. 

But let's focus on the given data. The problem states that JK = 10. Wait, but earlier, we were told that the length of MK (the diameter) is 6. There's a contradiction here. Wait, how can JK be 10 if the diameter is 6? That suggests that either there's a mistake, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, the initial predicates include LengthOf(Line(M,K),6). So MK is 6 units long. But then the problem says JK = 10. How is that possible? Unless JK is not a chord of the circle? But points J and K are both on the circle, so JK is a chord. But if the diameter is 6, the maximum possible distance between two points on the circle is 6. Therefore, having a chord of length 10 is impossible. This suggests that there's a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the given data. Let me go back to the problem statement again.

The user wrote:

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC PREDICATES:
- Circle(P)
- IsDiameterOf(Line(M,K),Circle(P))
- LengthOf(Line(M,K),6)
- RightAngle(Angle(J,Q,K))
- RightAngle(Angle(L,Q,K))
- Perpendicular(Line(J,L),Line(M,K))
- PointLiesOnCircle(Point(J),Circle(P))
- PointLiesOnCircle(Point(L),Circle(P))
- PointLiesOnCircle(Point(K),Circle(P))
- PointLiesOnCircle(Point(M),Circle(P))
- PointLiesOnLine(Point(Q),Line(J,L))
- PointLiesOnLine(Point(Q),Line(M,K))"

So, Line(M,K) is a diameter of the circle with length 6. So the diameter is 6, hence the radius is 3. Therefore, any chord in the circle cannot exceed 6 in length. However, the problem says "In ⊙P, JK = 10..." which contradicts this. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding. Perhaps the problem uses different labels? Or maybe the given data in the problem is different from the predicates? Let me check again.

Wait, the problem says "In ⊙P, JK = 10 and ∠JKL = 134. Find m∠JL." But according to the predicates, the length of MK is 6. So there's inconsistency. Perhaps the problem refers to segments in a different way? Or maybe the problem is referring to arc length instead of chord length? Or maybe there's a misprint?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem isn't referring to the same circle? No, the entire problem is about circle P.

This discrepancy suggests that there's an error either in the problem statement or in the predicates. However, since I need to proceed with the given information, perhaps I should assume that there's a typo and that the length of MK is actually 10, and JK is 6? But that's speculation. Alternatively, maybe the problem refers to arc length instead of chord length? But the problem says JK = 10, which typically refers to a segment, not an arc.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a different configuration. Let me try to ignore the conflict and see if I can resolve it. Suppose that despite the given diameter being 6, there's a chord JK of length 10. That's impossible, so maybe there's a misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps the problem uses different notation. For example, maybe JK is not a chord but another segment. But points J and K are on the circle, so JK must be a chord.

This inconsistency implies that there's an error. But assuming that the problem is correctly formulated, maybe the given length of MK is not the diameter. Wait, the predicate says IsDiameterOf(Line(M,K),Circle(P)), so MK is indeed the diameter. Hence, its length is 6. Therefore, the problem's mention of JK=10 is contradictory. 

Perhaps the problem intended that MK is not the diameter, but another chord? But the predicate explicitly states that MK is a diameter. This is confusing. Maybe I should proceed under the assumption that there's a typo, and that the length of MK is 10, while the diameter is 10, making the radius 5. Then, the chord JK could be 10, but that would mean that J and K are endpoints of the diameter, but then the arc would be 180 degrees. However, the problem mentions an angle of 134 degrees. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to arc length instead of chord length. For example, if JK is an arc measuring 10 units, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is mixing up arc and chord measures. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a different configuration where points J, K, L are arranged differently. For example, maybe Q is not on the diameter MK but somewhere else. But the predicates state that Q lies on both Line(J,L) and Line(M,K), so Q is the intersection point. 

Given the confusion, perhaps I should proceed with the given data, assuming that the length of MK is 6, and that the problem's mention of JK=10 is incorrect, or vice versa. But without resolving this, it's hard to proceed. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is correct, and there's a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the predicates. Let me re-examine the predicates again. 

The predicates include:

- LengthOf(Line(M,K),6): So MK is length 6.

- PointLiesOnCircle(Point(J),Circle(P)): So J is on the circle.

- Similarly, L, K, M are on the circle. So, points J, K, L, M are on the circle, and MK is a diameter. 

Therefore, MK is a diameter of length 6, so radius 3. Therefore, the maximum distance between any two points on the circle is 6. So, if JK is a chord connecting J and K, its length cannot exceed 6. But the problem says JK = 10, which is impossible. 

This suggests that there's an error in the problem setup. However, since the user provided this, perhaps I should proceed by assuming that the length of MK is 10, and the diameter is 10, making radius 5, allowing for a chord of length 10 (which would be the diameter itself). But then, if MK is the diameter, then J and K being connected by a chord of length 10 would imply that J and K are endpoints of the diameter, but then the other points... 

Alternatively, maybe the problem refers to arc JK being 10 radians? But that's unusual. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the arc length, not the chord length. For example, if arc JK measures 10 units, but that still doesn't fit with the diameter being 6. 

This is very confusing. Given this impasse, perhaps I need to look at the rest of the problem to see if there's more clues. The question asks for the measure of arc JL, given that arc JKL is 134 degrees. Wait, maybe the problem originally said that the arc JKL measures 134 degrees, which is the sum of arc JK and arc KL. Then, we're to find arc JL. 

Assuming that, even though there's a conflict in the given lengths, maybe I should proceed with the angular measures. Let me try that approach. 

Assume that the arc JKL measures 134 degrees. Since points J, K, L are on the circle, and Q is the intersection of JL and MK. Also, angles at Q are right angles. 

From the given, angles JQK and LQK are right angles. Since Q is on MK, which is the diameter. So, Q is a point on the diameter such that JL is perpendicular to MK. 

Because JL is perpendicular to MK at Q, then JL is a chord perpendicular to the diameter MK. In circle geometry, when a chord is perpendicular to a diameter, it creates certain symmetrical properties. 

Moreover, since angles at Q are right angles, triangles JQK and LQK are right-angled at Q. Therefore, in triangle JQK, right-angled at Q, and similarly for LQK. 

Let me consider the power of a point Q with respect to the circle. Since Q lies inside the circle, the product of the distances from Q to J and Q to K equals the product of the distances from Q to L and Q to K? Wait, no. Power of a point Q with respect to the circle is equal to QM * QK = QJ * QL. 

Wait, since Q lies on MK, which is the diameter, and MK is length 6. Let's denote the center as P, which is the midpoint of MK. Let me assign coordinates to simplify. Let me place the circle with center at P(0,0), and diameter MK along the x-axis. Let me set M at (-3, 0) and K at (3, 0), so that MK is length 6, and center P is at (0,0). 

Point Q is on MK, so it has coordinates (q, 0) for some q between -3 and 3. Also, JL is perpendicular to MK at Q, so JL is a vertical line passing through Q. Since JL is perpendicular to MK, which is horizontal, so JL is vertical. Therefore, points J and L are on the vertical line passing through Q. 

Since J and L are on the circle, and on the vertical line x=q. Let me find their y-coordinates. The equation of the circle is x² + y² = r², where r=3. 

Substituting x=q into the circle equation: q² + y² = 9 → y² = 9 - q² → y = ±√(9 - q²). Therefore, points J and L have coordinates (q, √(9 - q²)) and (q, -√(9 - q²)), but depending on which one is J and which is L. 

However, the problem mentions angles at Q: angle JQK and angle LQK are right angles. Let's consider triangle JQK. Since Q is (q,0), K is (3,0), and J is (q, sqrt(...)). The vector QJ is (0, sqrt(9-q²)), and QK is (3 - q, 0). The dot product of QJ and QK should be zero since they are perpendicular. 

Dot product: (0)(3 - q) + (sqrt(9 - q²))(0) = 0. Which is always true. Wait, that's not helpful. Wait, but QJ is from Q to J, which is (q - q, sqrt(...) - 0) = (0, sqrt(9 - q²)). QK is from Q to K, which is (3 - q, 0). Their dot product is (0)(3 - q) + (sqrt(9 - q²))(0) = 0. So yes, they are perpendicular. Therefore, regardless of q, this holds. So this confirms that JL is perpendicular to MK at Q. 

Now, considering the arc measures. The problem says arc JKL measures 134 degrees. Arc JKL would be the arc from J to L passing through K. So, that arc includes points J, K, L. Therefore, the measure of arc JKL is 134 degrees. We need to find the measure of arc JL. 

To find arc JL, we can subtract arc JK from arc JKL. But we need to know the measure of arc JK. Alternatively, since arc JKL is 134°, and arc JL is part of that. 

But how do we relate this to the given information? Let's recall that angles at Q are right angles. Also, since Q is the intersection of JL and MK, and we've set up coordinates for Q as (q, 0). 

Another approach: since angles JQK and LQK are right angles, then the angles subtended by arcs JQ and LQ at the circumference might relate. 

Alternatively, using the fact that in a circle, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. 

But since Q is inside the circle, maybe we can use the property that the angle formed by two chords intersecting inside the circle is equal to half the sum of the intercepted arcs. 

In this case, angle JQK is formed by chords QJ and QK. According to the intersecting chords angle theorem, the measure of angle JQK is equal to half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the angle and its vertical opposite. 

Wait, angle JQK is at point Q, formed by chords QJ and QK. The intercepted arcs would be arc JK and arc... Well, the formula states that the measure of the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. But since Q is inside the circle, the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. 

Wait, the formula is: If two chords intersect at a point inside the circle, then the measure of the angle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. 

So, angle JQK intercepts arcs JQ and KQ? No, more accurately, the angle formed by two chords intersecting at Q intercepts arcs that are opposite. 

Actually, when two chords intersect at Q, the measure of the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. For example, if two chords AB and CD intersect at Q, then angle AQD is equal to (arc AD + arc BC)/2. 

In our case, angle JQK is formed by chords QJ and QK. But since Q is on the diameter MK, and JL is another chord. Wait, maybe I need to consider the arcs intercepted by angle JQK. 

Wait, angle JQK is formed by QJ and QK. The intercepted arcs would be arc JK and the arc that's opposite. Wait, no. When two chords meet at a point inside the circle, the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. Here, angle at Q between QJ and QK intercepts arcs that are opposite. 

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the angle formed by two chords meeting at Q: QJ and QK. These two chords form angle JQK. The intercepted arcs are arc JK and the arc that's opposite across the circle. 

Wait, but since Q is inside the circle, the angle is equal to half the sum of the intercepted arcs. However, in this case, angle JQK is a right angle, so 90 degrees. Therefore, 90° = ½ (arc JQK + arc ... ?) Wait, I need to recall the exact theorem. 

The formula is: if two chords intersect at a point inside the circle, then the measure of the angle formed is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. 

In this case, angle JQK is formed by chords QJ and QK. The intercepted arcs would be arc JK and the arc that's opposite, which would be arc JL? Wait, no. Let me visualize: Q is on MK, and JL is perpendicular to MK at Q. So, the two intercepted arcs would be the arcs that are intercepted by the pairs of chords. 

Actually, angle JQK intercepts arcs JQ and KQ? No, that doesn't make sense. Let me refer to the standard formula. 

When two chords intersect at a point inside the circle, the measure of the angle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. So, for angle formed by chords AQ and BQ intersecting at Q, the angle is ½(arc AB + arc CD), where CD is the arc opposite. 

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the arcs that are intercepted by the angle and its vertical opposite. 

In this case, angle JQK is formed by chords QJ and QK. The intercepted arcs would be arc JK and arc... the arc that's opposite, which would be the arc that's not containing the angle. But since Q is inside the circle, the angle is formed by two chords, and the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are intercepted by those chords. 

Wait, maybe it's easier to consider that angle JQK intercepts arc JL. Wait, not sure. 

Alternatively, since angle JQK is a right angle, and it's formed by chords QJ and QK, then according to the intersecting chords theorem, the measure of angle JQK is equal to half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the angle and its vertical opposite. 

But since angle JQK is 90°, we have 90° = ½ (arc JK + arc JL). Wait, why arc JL? Because the vertical opposite angle would be angle formed by extending the chords, but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe angle JQK intercepts arc JL. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. 

When two chords intersect at Q, the angle formed is equal to half the sum of the intercepted arcs. So, angle JQK is formed by chords QJ and QK. These chords intercept arcs that are opposite. The intercepted arcs would be arc JK and the arc that's opposite, which would be arc JL? 

Wait, if I imagine the circle with points J and K, and Q somewhere inside. The angle at Q between QJ and QK would intercept arcs that are opposite. 

Alternatively, perhaps angle JQK intercepts arc JK and arc JL. But this is getting too vague. Maybe I should use coordinates to calculate.

Earlier, I set up coordinates with center at (0,0), M at (-3,0), K at (3,0), Q at (q,0). Points J and L are on the vertical line x=q, so their coordinates are (q, y) and (q, -y), since they are symmetric about the x-axis. 

Then, the arc JKL is 134 degrees. Arc JKL goes from J to L via K. So, starting at J, going through K to L. The measure of this arc is 134 degrees. 

To find arc JL, we can consider that arc JKL is the sum of arc JK and arc KL. Wait, but arc JK plus arc KL would be arc JKL. But arc JK is from J to K, and arc KL is from K to L. 

Alternatively, if the arc passes through K, then arc JKL is the major arc JL if K is on the opposite side. 

Alternatively, since points J and L are on the vertical line through Q, and K is on the x-axis. Depending on where Q is located, the position of J and L changes. 

Let me suppose that Q is between M and K. Since JL is perpendicular to MK at Q, and angles at Q are right angles. 

Let me compute the arc measures. Assume that arc JKL is 134 degrees. Let's consider the positions of J and L. Since J and L are symmetric about the x-axis (since JL is vertical), the arc from J to L passing through K would be the major arc JL. 

The total circumference is 360 degrees. If arc JKL is 134 degrees, then the remaining arc JL (not passing through K) would be 360 - 134 = 226 degrees. But this depends on the direction of the arc. However, the problem likely refers to the minor arc JL. 

Wait, but the problem states "m∠JL", which is ambiguous. But assuming it's the measure of arc JL, and given that arc JKL is 134 degrees, which is the arc passing through K. 

If arc JKL is 134 degrees, then arc JL passing through K is 134 degrees. To find arc JL, which is the other arc, we need to determine whether it's the minor or major arc. 

But without knowing the exact positions, it's tricky. However, since angles at Q are right angles, and Q is on MK, which is the diameter, perhaps we can find relations between the arcs. 

Let me recall that in a circle, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Also, since Q is inside the circle, the angles formed by intersecting chords relate to the arcs. 

As before, angle JQK is 90 degrees, which is formed by chords QJ and QK. Using the intersecting chords angle theorem: angle JQK = ½ (arc JK + arc JL). 

Wait, if that's the case, then:

angle JQK = ½ (arc JK + arc JL)

We know angle JQK is 90°, so:

90° = ½ (arc JK + arc JL)

Multiply both sides by 2:

180° = arc JK + arc JL

Similarly, angle LQK is also 90°, formed by chords QL and QK. Applying the same theorem:

angle LQK = ½ (arc LK + arc JL)

Which gives:

90° = ½ (arc LK + arc JL)

Multiply by 2:

180° = arc LK + arc JL

Now, adding these two equations:

arc JK + arc JL + arc LK + arc JL = 360°

But arc JK + arc LK is the arc from J to K to L, which is arc JKL. Which is given as 134°. So:

arc JKL + 2*arc JL = 360°

Wait, no. Let me clarify. 

From the first equation: arc JK + arc JL = 180°

From the second equation: arc LK + arc JL = 180°

Adding them: arc JK + arc LK + 2*arc JL = 360°

But arc JK + arc LK is the arc from J to K to L, which is arc JKL, given as 134°. So:

134° + 2*arc JL = 360°

Thus:

2*arc JL = 360° - 134° = 226°

Therefore, arc JL = 113°

Wait, but this doesn't match any of the answer choices. The options are A. 46, B. 67, C. 92, D. 134. None of these are 113. 

Hmm, this suggests a mistake in my reasoning. Let me check again.

Wait, arc JK + arc JL = 180°, and arc LK + arc JL = 180°. Adding gives arc JK + arc LK + 2*arc JL = 360°. But arc JK + arc LK is arc JKL, which is given as 134°, so:

134° + 2*arc JL = 360° => 2*arc JL = 226° => arc JL = 113°, which is not among the options. So something is wrong here. 

Maybe my assumption about which arcs are added is incorrect. Let me reconsider the intersecting chords theorem. 

The formula is: the measure of the angle formed by two intersecting chords is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. 

In angle JQK, formed by chords QJ and QK, the intercepted arcs are arc JK and arc JL. Wait, why arc JL? Because when two chords intersect at Q, the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are the arcs that are opposite the angle. So, for angle JQK, the intercepted arcs are arc JK (between J and K) and arc JL (between J and L)? No, that doesn't seem right. 

Actually, the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are cut off by the two chords. For angle formed at Q by chords QJ and QK, the intercepted arcs would be arc JK (the arc between J and K not containing Q) and arc JL (wait, no). 

Actually, when two chords intersect at a point inside the circle, the angle is half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the angle and its vertical opposite. 

In this case, angle JQK is formed by chords QJ and QK. The intercepted arcs would be arc JK (between J and K) and the arc that is opposite, which would be the arc that's intercepted by the other pair of vertical angles. Wait, maybe I need to think of the vertical angle at Q. 

Alternatively, since JL is a chord, and Q is on MK, perhaps the intercepted arcs are arc JK and arc JL. 

But without a clear diagram, it's challenging. Let me try another approach. 

Since JL is perpendicular to MK at Q, and MK is the diameter, then JL is a chord perpendicular to the diameter. This implies that JL is bisected by the diameter MK. Wait, no, only if the diameter passes through the midpoint of JL. Since JL is perpendicular to MK at Q, then Q is the midpoint of JL. Because in a circle, if a diameter is perpendicular to a chord, it bisects the chord. 

Wait, yes! If a diameter is perpendicular to a chord, it bisects the chord. Since MK is a diameter and it's perpendicular to JL at Q, then Q is the midpoint of JL. So, Q is the midpoint of JL. 

Therefore, JQ = QL. 

Now, since Q is the midpoint of JL, and Q is on MK, which is the diameter. 

Let me consider triangles JQK and LQK. They are congruent right triangles, since QJ = QL, QK is common, and both are right angles. 

So, in triangle JQK, right-angled at Q, with legs QJ and QK. Similarly for triangle LQK. 

Let me denote QJ = QL = a, and QK = b. Then, by Pythagoras:

For triangle JQK: QJ^2 + QK^2 = JK^2.

But JK is the length of the chord from J to K. But earlier, there was a contradiction with the given length of MK being 6. Assuming that the problem's mention of JK = 10 is correct, and that there's an error in the diameter length. But since this leads to inconsistency, perhaps the problem has a different setup. 

Alternatively, let's proceed symbolically. Let me denote the length of QJ as a, QK as b. Then, JK^2 = a^2 + b^2. 

Also, since Q is the midpoint of JL, JL = 2a. 

Additionally, since Q is on MK, which is a diameter of length 6, then the distance from Q to M and Q to K can be determined. Let me denote the center P as the midpoint of MK, so MP = PK = 3. Let me denote the coordinate system again: M(-3,0), K(3,0), center P(0,0). Q is at (q,0). Then, QK = |q - 3|, and QM = |q + 3|. 

But since Q is on MK, and JL is perpendicular to MK at Q, then JL is vertical through Q. Coordinates of J and L are (q, y) and (q, -y), as before. 

Then, the length of QJ is sqrt((q - q)^2 + (y - 0)^2) = |y|. So QJ = |y|. 

Also, QK is the distance from Q(q,0) to K(3,0), which is |3 - q|. 

Then, from the Pythagorean theorem in triangle JQK:

QJ^2 + QK^2 = JK^2 

=> y^2 + (3 - q)^2 = JK^2 

But JK is the distance between J(q,y) and K(3,0):

JK^2 = (q - 3)^2 + (y - 0)^2 = (3 - q)^2 + y^2, which is the same as above. So this checks out. 

But we don't know the value of JK. The problem states that JK = 10, which would give us:

y^2 + (3 - q)^2 = 10^2 = 100 

But since J is on the circle x^2 + y^2 = 9 (radius 3), substituting x=q into the circle equation:

q^2 + y^2 = 9 

Thus, y^2 = 9 - q^2 

Substitute into the previous equation:

(9 - q^2) + (3 - q)^2 = 100 

Expand (3 - q)^2: 9 - 6q + q^2 

So:

9 - q^2 + 9 - 6q + q^2 = 100 

Simplify:

9 + 9 - 6q = 100 

18 - 6q = 100 

-6q = 82 

q = -82/6 ≈ -13.666...

But this places Q outside the circle, since the diameter is from -3 to 3 on the x-axis. Q at x ≈ -13.666 is far left of the circle, which is impossible. 

This indicates that the given condition JK = 10 is incompatible with the circle having diameter 6. Hence, there must be a mistake in the problem. 

But since the problem is given, perhaps there's a different interpretation. Maybe the length of MK is not 6, but the length of JL is 6? Or perhaps the problem uses different labels. 

Alternatively, perhaps the length of JK is not a chord but an arc. Let's assume that arc JK is 10 units, but this is unconventional. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the arc JL being 10, but this is speculative. 

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress due to conflicting data, I'll try to proceed with the arc measures based on the intersecting chords theorem. Earlier, I found arc JL = 113°, which is not among the options. But since the answer choices are A-D, perhaps I made a mistake in applying the theorem. 

Let me revisit the intersecting chords angle theorem. If angle JQK is formed by intersecting chords QJ and QK, then the measure of angle JQK is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. 

The intercepted arcs are the arcs that are opposite the angle. In this case, the intercepted arcs would be arc JL and arc...? Wait, when two chords intersect at Q, the angle is formed by two chords, and the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are intercepted by the pairs of vertical angles. 

So, for angle JQK, the intercepted arcs are arc JK and arc JL. Wait, no. Let me refer to a textbook definition. 

According to the intersecting chords angle theorem: the measure of an angle formed by two chords intersecting at a point inside the circle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. 

So, angle JQK is formed by chords QJ and QK. The intercepted arcs are arc JK (between J and K) and arc JL (between J and L)? No, arc JL is between J and L. 

Wait, perhaps it's arc JL and arc... the arc that is opposite. Wait, if you have two chords intersecting at Q, the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. 

For example, if two chords AB and CD intersect at Q, then angle AQC is half (arc AC + arc BD). 

Applying this to our case, where the two chords are QJ and QK, but there's only one chord. Wait, no, QJ and QK are parts of the same line? No, QJ and QK are two separate chords from Q to J and Q to K. 

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as two chords: QJ and QK, but they are not intersecting each other; they share a common endpoint at Q. So, this is not the case. The theorem applies to two intersecting chords, i.e., two chords that cross at Q. But in this case, QJ and QK are not crossing each other; they are both emanating from Q. 

Ah, this is a crucial mistake! The intersecting chords theorem applies when two chords intersect at a point inside the circle, creating two pairs of vertical angles. In this case, angle JQK is formed by two chords: QJ and QK, but they are not intersecting each other; they are just meeting at Q. So the theorem does not apply directly here. 

Instead, since Q is on the diameter MK, and JL is perpendicular to MK at Q, we can use other properties. 

Let me try using the fact that JL is perpendicular to MK at Q, and Q is the midpoint of JL. As previously established, since MK is a diameter perpendicular to JL, Q is the midpoint of JL. 

Thus, JL is bisected by the diameter MK at Q. 

Now, consider the arc measures. Let me consider the arcs subtended by JL and JK. 

Since Q is the midpoint of JL, and MK is the diameter, let's consider the power of point Q with respect to the circle. The power of Q is equal to QJ * QL = QM * QK. 

Since Q is on MK, QM * QK = (distance from Q to M) * (distance from Q to K). 

Also, QJ * QL = QJ^2, since QJ = QL. 

So, QJ^2 = QM * QK 

Let me express this in terms of variables. Let me denote the distance from Q to M as x, and from Q to K as y. Since MK is length 6, x + y = 6. 

Also, QJ^2 = x * y 

But QJ is the length of the segment from Q to J, which is the distance from Q to the circle along the perpendicular. Since Q is inside the circle, and JL is perpendicular to MK at Q, the length QJ can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem in the context of the circle. 

But without knowing the exact position of Q, this is difficult. However, we can relate it to the circle's radius. 

The distance from the center P to Q is |OP|, where O is the center. Let me denote the center P as the midpoint of MK, so P is at (0,0) in my coordinate system. Q is at (q,0), so the distance PQ is |q - 0| = |q|. 

The length QJ can be found using the formula for the distance from a point inside the circle to a point on the circle. For any point inside the circle, the square of the distance from the point to a point on the circle is equal to the power of the point. 

But the power of Q with respect to the circle is OP^2 - r^2, but wait, no. The power of a point Q inside the circle is equal to r^2 - OQ^2. 

Wait, the power of point Q is defined as QJ * QL = r^2 - OQ^2. 

Since QJ = QL, this becomes QJ^2 = r^2 - OQ^2. 

But earlier, we also have QJ^2 = QM * QK. 

So, combining these:

QM * QK = r^2 - OQ^2 

Let me substitute values. The radius r is 3, so r^2 = 9. 

QM is the distance from Q to M, which is |q - (-3)| = |q + 3|. 

QK is the distance from Q to K, which is |q - 3|. 

OQ is the distance from center P(0,0) to Q(q,0), which is |q|. 

So, we have:

|q + 3| * |q - 3| = 9 - q^2 

Note that |q + 3| * |q - 3| = |q^2 - 9|. 

So:

|q^2 - 9| = 9 - q^2 

This implies that q^2 - 9 ≤ 0, so q^2 ≤ 9, which is true since Q is inside the circle. 

Thus, |q^2 - 9| = 9 - q^2, so the equation holds. 

This doesn't provide new information. 

But we also know from the problem that JK = 10, which we saw leads to a contradiction. However, if we assume that the length of JL is 10, then since JL = 2QJ, QJ = 5. 

So, QJ^2 = 25 = r^2 - OQ^2 => 25 = 9 - q^2 => q^2 = 9 - 25 = -16, which is impossible. 

This suggests that the given length of 10 is invalid. 

At this point, I realize that there's a fundamental inconsistency in the problem's given data. Without resolving this, it's impossible to proceed. However, since the problem is presented as solvable, perhaps the length of MK is 10, and the diameter is 10, making radius 5. Let me try this scenario. 

Assume that the length of MK is 10, so diameter is 10, radius 5. Then, the circle has equation x^2 + y^2 = 25. 

Let me redefine: M(-5,0), K(5,0), center P(0,0). Q is at (q,0), and JL is vertical through Q. 

Points J and L are (q, y) and (q, -y), with q^2 + y^2 = 25 => y^2 = 25 - q^2. 

Length of QJ is |y|, and JL is 2|y|. 

Now, if the problem states that JK = 10, which would mean the distance between J(q,y) and K(5,0) is 10. 

Compute JK^2 = (q - 5)^2 + y^2 = (q - 5)^2 + (25 - q^2) = q^2 - 10q + 25 + 25 - q^2 = -10q + 50 = 100 

So, -10q + 50 = 100 => -10q = 50 => q = -5. 

But q = -5 is the point M, which is on the circle. So, Q coincides with M. But then JL would be the vertical line through M, which is x=-5. Points J and L would be (-5, y) and (-5, -y), with y^2 = 25 - (-5)^2 = 0, so y=0. Thus, J and L coincide with M, which is not possible. 

This suggests that even with diameter 10, the given JK=10 leads to degenerate points. 

This indicates that there's a fundamental flaw in the problem's setup, possibly a misprint. Given the time I've invested and the lack of resolution, I'll proceed with the earlier calculation where arc JL = 113°, which is close to none of the options. But since the answer choices are A-D, and assuming that there's a miscalculation in my earlier steps, let me try again.

Earlier, I assumed that angle JQK = ½ (arc JK + arc JL) = 90°, leading to arc JK + arc JL = 180°. But if arc JKL = 134°, which is arc JK + arc KL = 134°, and if arc JL = arc JK + arc KL - arc JL? No. 

Wait, arc JKL is the arc from J to L passing through K. So, it's arc JK + arc KL. If arc JKL = 134°, and arc JL is the arc from J to L not passing through K, then the total circumference is 360°, so arc JL + arc JKL = 360°, assuming arc JL is the other arc. So:

arc JL + 134° = 360° => arc JL = 226°, which is not an option. 

Alternatively, if arc JKL is the minor
