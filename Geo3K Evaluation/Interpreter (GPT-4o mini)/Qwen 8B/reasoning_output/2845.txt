MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, C, D, E connected in some way. There are several lines mentioned: Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Line(D,E), Line(E,A), and Line(E,C). Also, there are triangles mentioned: Triangle(A,B,C), Triangle(E,B,C), and Triangle(E,C,D). Then there are angles labeled 1 through 9, with measures given for angles 1, 2, and 3. We need to find the measure of angle 9.

First, I should probably sketch the figure based on the given lines and triangles. Let me visualize it. Points A, B, C, D, E connected in a pentagon? Wait, but there are triangles involved. Let me think. 

Starting with Line(A,B), then Line(B,C), so points A-B-C. Then Line(C,D), so C-D. Then Line(D,E), so D-E. Then Line(E,A) connects back to A. Also, Line(E,C) connects E to C. So maybe the figure has a pentagon ABCDE with diagonals EC and maybe others? But also triangles like ABC, EBC, ECD. Hmm.

Let me note down the connections again:

Lines:
AB, BC, CD, DE, EA, EC.

So connecting A-B-C-D-E-A, making a pentagon, but with an extra diagonal EC. Also, the triangles mentioned are ABC, EBC, ECD. So triangle ABC is formed by AB, BC, and AC? Wait, but there's no line AC mentioned. Wait, the lines given are AB, BC, CD, DE, EA, EC. So EC is a line. Therefore, triangle EBC would have sides EB, BC, EC. Wait, but where is point E connected to B? Because there's Line(E,A) and Line(E,C). So E is connected to A and C. So E is connected to A and C. So in triangle EBC, the sides are EB, BC, and EC. But how do we know about EB? Since E is connected to A and C, but not directly to B unless there's another line. Wait, but Line(B,C) exists. So B is connected to C. So triangle EBC would require points E, B, C connected by lines. Since E is connected to C and B is connected to C, but is E connected to B? Not directly stated. Unless there's an implicit connection through other lines. Maybe not. Wait, but the triangle EBC is given as a predicate. So that implies that the three sides exist. So if triangle EBC exists, then EB must be a line segment. But according to the given lines, there's no explicit line EB. However, maybe the lines connect through other points?

Wait, perhaps the figure isn't a simple polygon but includes intersecting lines. For example, Line(E,A) and Line(E,C) meet at E. So E is connected to A and C. Then, considering triangle EBC, points E, B, C must form a triangle. So E is connected to B via some line? Or is there another line? Wait, the lines given are AB, BC, CD, DE, EA, EC. So from E, we have lines to A and C. From B, we have lines to A and C. So maybe there's an intersection somewhere? Like, maybe lines EA and BC intersect at some point? But that complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe the figure is a star shape with overlapping lines. Alternatively, maybe it's two triangles sharing a common side. For instance, triangle ABC and EBC share BC. And triangle ECD shares EC with EBC. So maybe points A, B, C, D, E arranged such that EC connects E to C, forming triangles.

But without seeing the actual diagram, it's a bit challenging. But since the angles are given as 1, 2, 3, and we need angle 9, perhaps there are multiple triangles and intersecting lines creating various angles. Let me consider that each angle label refers to specific angles in these triangles or intersections.

Given that angles 1, 2, 3 have measures 58°, 47°, 26° respectively. Need to find angle 9.

Let me think about the triangles mentioned. First, Triangle(A,B,C): so triangle ABC. Then Triangle(E,B,C): triangle EBC. Triangle(E,C,D): triangle ECD.

Also, there are angles labeled 1 through 9. Perhaps these angles are within the triangles or formed by intersecting lines.

Assuming that angle labels correspond to internal angles of the triangles or angles formed by intersecting lines.

For example, in triangle ABC, angles could be angle at A, B, or C. Similarly for other triangles. But since the angles are labeled 1-9, they may refer to different angles in different parts of the figure.

Alternatively, maybe there are vertical angles, supplementary angles, or angles formed by transversals.

Since the problem gives specific angle measures for angles 1, 2, 3, and asks for angle 9, I need to relate them through geometric theorems.

Let me start by analyzing the triangles.

First, Triangle ABC: points A, B, C. Let's assume that angle at B is part of this triangle. But without knowing which angle corresponds to which label, it's hard. However, maybe the given angles 1, 2, 3 are in these triangles.

Similarly, Triangle EBC: points E, B, C. Triangle ECD: points E, C, D.

Perhaps the angles given are in these triangles. For example, angle 1 could be an angle in triangle ABC, angle 2 in triangle EBC, angle 3 in triangle ECD, and angle 9 in another triangle or location.

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is at point A, angle 2 at point B, angle 3 at point C, but that depends on the figure.

Another approach: since there are multiple triangles, maybe applying triangle angle sum, exterior angles, or properties of intersecting lines.

Let me think about the given angles first. Angle 1 is 58°, angle 2 is 47°, angle 3 is 26°. These could be angles in the triangles mentioned.

For example, suppose angle 1 is an angle in triangle ABC. Let's say angle at A is 58°, angle at B is something, angle at C is something. Then, in triangle EBC, angle 2 could be at point B or C. Similarly for angle 3 in triangle ECD.

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is an angle formed by intersecting lines, like at point E or another intersection.

But without more info, this is tricky. Maybe I need to use the fact that the sum of angles around a point is 360°, or that in a triangle, the sum is 180°, or that vertical angles are equal, or supplementary angles.

Let me attempt to reconstruct the figure step by step.

Start with points A, B, C, D, E.

Lines:

AB, BC, CD, DE, EA, EC.

So starting from A connected to B, then B to C, C to D, D to E, E back to A, and also E connected to C.

This forms a pentagon ABCDE with a diagonal EC. So the figure is a pentagon with one diagonal EC.

Triangles mentioned:

ABC: This triangle uses sides AB, BC, and AC (but AC is not explicitly a line; however, since E is connected to C, and A is connected to E, maybe AC is formed by combining lines AE and EC? No, because EC is a separate line. Wait, but if there's a line EC, then triangle ABC would have vertices A, B, C, with sides AB, BC, and AC. But AC isn't listed as a line. However, maybe AC is formed by the intersection of other lines? Or maybe it's implied that AC exists as part of the triangle, even though it's not explicitly drawn. That might be an assumption.

Similarly, triangle EBC would have sides EB, BC, EC. But EB isn't a given line. Wait, unless there's an intersection. For example, if lines EA and BC intersect at some point, but that's not specified. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the triangles are formed by existing lines. For example, triangle ABC is formed by AB, BC, and AC, where AC is a diagonal. But since AC is not given as a line, maybe that's inferred.

Alternatively, maybe the figure is a combination of triangles. For instance, triangle ABC is formed by AB, BC, and CA, triangle EBC is formed by EB, BC, EC, and triangle ECD is formed by EC, CD, ED.

But again, without knowing where EB and ED are, it's unclear. However, since there's a line DE, which connects D to E, and line EA connects E to A. So ED and EA are present.

Maybe the key is to look at the triangles and their angles.

Suppose we take triangle EBC. It has angles at E, B, and C. Let's denote those angles as angle at E (maybe angle 1?), angle at B (angle 2?), angle at C (angle 3?). But the given angles are 1, 2, 3. Suppose angle at B in triangle EBC is angle 2 (47°), angle at C is angle 3 (26°), then angle at E would be 180 - 47 - 26 = 107°. But that's just one possibility.

Alternatively, if angle 1 is part of triangle ABC, angle 2 part of triangle EBC, and angle 3 part of triangle ECD.

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is an external angle, leading to other angles.

But this seems too vague. Let me try to think of another approach.

Given that there are angles 1, 2, 3 with measures 58°, 47°, 26°, and need to find angle 9. Perhaps angle 9 is an external angle or related through some geometric relationship.

Another thought: since there are multiple triangles, maybe using the concept of exterior angles. For example, in triangle ABC, an exterior angle equals the sum of the remote interior angles.

But without knowing which angles are which, it's still ambiguous.

Wait, maybe looking at the triangles:

Triangle ABC: Let's assume that angle at A is angle 1 (58°), angle at B is angle 2 (47°), and angle at C is angle 3 (26°). But wait, adding up 58+47+26=131°, which doesn't make sense for a triangle. So that's impossible. Hence, that can't be the case.

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is in triangle EBC. Let's say angle at E is 58°, angle at B is 47°, so angle at C would be 180-58-47=75°. Then angle 3 could be part of another triangle.

Alternatively, angle 3 being 26°, maybe in triangle ECD. Let's say angle at D is 26°, and other angles...

But this is getting too speculative. Maybe I need to consider that angle labels are in specific locations.

Alternatively, since there are multiple lines, maybe certain angles are vertically opposite, or adjacent, or supplementary.

Wait, the lines EA and EC meet at E. So at point E, there are two lines: EA and EC. So angle between EA and EC at point E would be an angle. If that's angle 1, 2, or 3?

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is at point A, angle 2 at point B, angle 3 at point C, etc.

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's difficult. Maybe I need to consider the total sum of angles around points or in polygons.

Alternatively, since there are triangles, maybe using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, and that the sum of angles around a point is 360°.

Let me try to consider the triangle EBC. If I can find its angles, maybe I can relate them to other angles.

Suppose angle at B is 47° (angle 2), angle at C is 26° (angle 3), then angle at E would be 180 - 47 - 26 = 107°. So angle at E is 107°. Now, if that angle is related to other angles in the figure, maybe angle 9 is part of another triangle.

Looking at triangle ECD: points E, C, D. If angle at C is part of this triangle. If angle at C is 26°, then maybe angle at D is something else. But without knowing other angles, hard to tell.

Alternatively, angle 1 is part of triangle ABC. If angle at A is 58°, then in triangle ABC, other angles would depend on the other sides.

Wait, maybe I need to check for cyclic quadrilaterals or something, but without knowing if points lie on a circle.

Alternatively, think about the entire figure. Points A, B, C, D, E with lines as described. Maybe it's a pentagon with certain diagonals, creating multiple triangles. For example, the diagonals EC divides the pentagon into triangles.

But again, without a diagram, it's challenging. However, since there are three triangles mentioned: ABC, EBC, ECD. Maybe these triangles share sides.

Let me try to imagine that triangle ABC is connected to triangle EBC via BC, and triangle ECD is connected to EBC via EC.

Now, focusing on triangle EBC: if we know two angles, we can find the third. Suppose angle at B is 47° (angle 2), angle at C is 26° (angle 3), then angle at E is 107°, as before. If that angle at E is part of another triangle, like triangle ECD, then maybe angle at E is 107°, and in triangle ECD, if we know another angle, we can find the remaining ones.

But where does angle 1 come into play? Maybe angle 1 is in triangle ABC. Let's say angle at A is 58° (angle 1). Then in triangle ABC, angles at A is 58°, angle at B is x, angle at C is y. So x + y = 122°. Without more info, can't proceed.

Alternatively, if angle at B in triangle ABC is angle 2 (47°), then angle at A plus angle at C would be 133°, but again not helpful.

Hmm. Another idea: maybe the angles given are not necessarily the internal angles of the triangles, but rather angles formed by intersecting lines. For example, at point E, where lines EA and EC meet, the angle between them is angle 1, 2, or 3.

Alternatively, at point C, where lines BC, CD, and EC meet, there might be multiple angles. For instance, angle between BC and EC, and angle between EC and CD.

But since the problem mentions angles 1-9, it's likely that each angle label corresponds to a specific angle in the figure. Given that, perhaps angle 1 is at point E, angle 2 at point B, angle 3 at point C, and angle 9 at another point.

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is an external angle to triangle ABC, angle 2 is an external angle to triangle EBC, etc.

But I'm stuck without more concrete information. Let me think differently. Since there are three given angles, maybe they are angles in different triangles, and angle 9 is related via some geometric principle.

Let me try assigning variables. Let's say:

In triangle ABC, suppose angle at B is 47° (angle 2), angle at C is 26° (angle 3), then angle at A would be 180 - 47 - 26 = 107°. So angle at A is 107°, which could be angle 1? But angle 1 is given as 58°, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, angle at A is 58° (angle 1), angle at B is 47° (angle 2), then angle at C would be 180 - 58 - 47 = 75°, which could be angle 3. But angle 3 is given as 26°, so that doesn't match either.

Hmm. So that suggests that my initial assumption about which angles belong to which triangle is incorrect.

Alternative approach: Maybe angle 1 is an angle outside of the triangles, like an angle formed by intersecting lines. For example, if lines EA and EC meet at E, forming angle 1. If angle 1 is at E, then in triangle EBC, angle at E would be angle 1 (58°), and if angle at B is 47° (angle 2), then angle at C would be 180 - 58 - 47 = 75°, which could be angle 3. But angle 3 is given as 26°, so that doesn't align.

Wait, but maybe angle 3 is in triangle ECD. Let's say in triangle ECD, angle at C is 26°, angle at D is something, angle at E is something. If angle at E is 75°, then angle at D would be 180 - 75 - 26 = 79°. Not sure how that helps yet.

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is at point C. For example, if angle between EC and CD is 58°, and angle between EC and CB is 47°, then angle at C would be 58 + 47 = 105°, but that's if those are adjacent angles. Wait, but angle at C could be split into two angles by the line EC. So if angle between BC and EC is 47° (angle 2), and angle between EC and CD is 58° (angle 1), then total angle at C would be 47 + 58 = 105°. But then, in triangle EBC, angle at C would be 47°, and in triangle ECD, angle at C would be 58°, but that seems inconsistent.

Alternatively, if angle 1 is at point A, angle 2 at point B, angle 3 at point C, and they are angles of triangles ABC, EBC, ECD respectively. Let me try again:

In triangle ABC, angle at A is 58°, angle at B is 47°, then angle at C is 180 - 58 - 47 = 75°. In triangle EBC, angle at B is 47°, angle at C is 26°, so angle at E is 180 - 47 - 26 = 107°. In triangle ECD, angle at C is 26°, angle at D is something, angle at E is something. If angle at E in triangle ECD is same as angle at E in triangle EBC (107°)? No, because angle at E in triangle EBC is between EB and EC, while in triangle ECD, angle at E is between EC and ED. So they are different angles. So angle at E in ECD would be something else.

But how does this relate to angle 9? Maybe angle 9 is an external angle or something else.

Alternatively, maybe angle 9 is the difference between two angles or a supplement.

Wait, another thought: since there are multiple triangles, maybe using the fact that the sum of angles around a point is 360°. For example, at point E, where lines EA, EC, and possibly others meet. Let's say at point E, there are angles from lines EA, EC, and maybe ED? Wait, line DE connects D to E, and line EA connects E to A. So at point E, we have two lines: EA and EC (from the given lines), and also ED (from line DE). Wait, line DE connects D to E, so at point E, there are lines EA, EC, and ED. Wait, but line DE goes from D to E, so at point E, line ED ends, and line EA starts. So the angles at point E would involve lines EA, EC, and ED. Wait, but how many angles are formed at point E? Let me think.

At point E, there are three lines: EA, EC, and ED. Wait, ED is part of line DE, so at point E, the lines are EA, EC, and ED. Wait, but line EC connects to point C, line ED connects to D, and line EA connects to A. So the angles at point E would be between EA and EC, between EC and ED, and between ED and EA. So three angles at point E.

If angle between EA and EC is angle 1 (58°), angle between EC and ED is angle 2 (47°), and angle between ED and EA is angle 3 (26°). Adding up these angles: 58 + 47 + 26 = 131°, which is less than 360°, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no—those three angles are adjacent, so their sum should be 360°, but that's only if they're around point E. Wait, no—if there are three rays emanating from point E, they divide the plane into three angles. The sum of those three angles should be 360°. So if the three angles at E are 58°, 47°, and 26°, their sum is 131°, which is not 360°, so that's impossible. Thus, this scenario is invalid.

Therefore, my assumption about which angles are at point E is wrong. So angle 1, 2, 3 cannot all be angles at point E.

Another possibility: angle 1 is an angle inside one triangle, angle 2 in another, and angle 3 in another. Let me try to assign them.

Let's say angle 1 is in triangle ABC, angle 2 in triangle EBC, and angle 3 in triangle ECD. Let's explore this:

In triangle ABC, angle 1 = 58°, so let's say it's at vertex A. Then, angles at B and C would add up to 122°. In triangle EBC, angle 2 = 47°, say at vertex B. Then angle at C would be 180 - 47 - angle at E. In triangle ECD, angle 3 = 26°, say at vertex D. Then angle at E and angle at C would add up to 154°, depending on other angles.

But this is still too vague. Let me think about the triangles and their angles.

Another idea: since there are three triangles mentioned, maybe they share common sides, allowing us to find relations between angles.

For example, triangle ABC and triangle EBC share side BC. So, the angles at B and C in both triangles could be related.

Suppose in triangle ABC, angle at B is x, angle at C is y. In triangle EBC, angle at B is x', angle at C is y'. Depending on the configuration, these angles might be related.

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the sum of angles around point C is 360°. At point C, there are lines BC, CD, and EC. So, the angles at point C would be between BC and EC, between EC and CD, and between DC and BC. Wait, but if lines BC, CD, and EC meet at point C, then the angles around point C would be:

Between BC and EC: let's call this angle α.

Between EC and CD: angle β.

And between DC and BC: angle γ.

These angles α + β + γ = 360°, but wait, no—around a point, the sum is 360°. However, if there are three lines meeting at C, they divide the plane into three angles. So α + β + γ = 360°.

But if angle 3 is one of these angles, say β = 26°, then α and γ would be other angles. If angle 3 is part of triangle ECD, then angle β could be part of triangle ECD.

But again, this is too vague.

Let me try to think of the given angles as part of the triangles' angles.

If angle 1 is in triangle ABC, angle 2 in triangle EBC, angle 3 in triangle ECD.

Let me assume that in triangle ABC, angle at A is 58° (angle 1). In triangle EBC, angle at B is 47° (angle 2). In triangle ECD, angle at D is 26° (angle 3).

Then, in triangle ABC: angles at A = 58°, at B = ?, at C = ?. Let's call angle at B as x and angle at C as y. So x + y = 122°.

In triangle EBC: angles at B = 47°, at C = ?, at E = ?. Let's call angle at C as z and angle at E as w. So 47 + z + w = 180 → z + w = 133°.

In triangle ECD: angles at D = 26°, at C = ?, at E = ?. Let's say angle at C is z' and angle at E is w'. So z' + w' = 154°.

But how do these relate to each other? If angle at C in triangle EBC is the same as angle at C in triangle ECD, or if they are different?

If angle at C in triangle EBC is z, and in triangle ECD is z', then those could be different angles. For example, if line EC splits the angle at C into two parts: one part is z (in triangle EBC), and the other is z' (in triangle ECD). So, if angle at C in the overall figure is z + z'.

But then, if we consider the angles around point C, which includes angles from lines BC, CD, and EC. So the total angle at point C would be the sum of angles from BC to EC (z), EC to CD (z'), and CD to BC (some other angle). But unless we know more, it's hard to proceed.

However, if we assume that angle at C in triangle EBC is the same as angle at C in triangle ECD, then z = z', and thus z + w = 133°, and z + w' = 154°. But this would mean that w and w' are different, which is possible.

But without knowing more, it's hard to link these equations.

Another idea: maybe angle 9 is an angle formed by extending lines, creating an exterior angle. For example, if there's a triangle where one angle is angle 9, and it's related to the given angles through exterior angle theorem.

Alternatively, since there are three given angles, perhaps they are part of a larger triangle or quadrilateral.

Wait, let's think about the entire figure. If we have points A, B, C, D, E connected as described, maybe it's a pentagon with certain diagonals, and angle 9 is an angle inside one of the triangles or at a vertex.

Let me try to think of the angles given as parts of the triangles:

Assume angle 1 is in triangle ABC, angle 2 in triangle EBC, angle 3 in triangle ECD.

If in triangle ABC, angle at A is 58° (angle 1), then the other angles are at B and C. In triangle EBC, angle at B is 47° (angle 2), so angle at B is 47°, and in triangle ECD, angle at D is 26° (angle 3). 

Now, in triangle EBC, angles at B is 47°, at C is let's say x, and at E is y. So x + y = 133°.

In triangle ECD, angles at D is 26°, at C is z, and at E is w. So z + w = 154°.

But if angle at C in triangle EBC (x) and angle at C in triangle ECD (z) are parts of the total angle at point C, then x + z = total angle at C.

But without knowing the total angle at C, this is still ambiguous.

But if I assume that the total angle at point C is made up of angles from triangle ABC and triangle EBC and ECD. For example, if in triangle ABC, angle at C is part of the total angle at C, and similarly for triangle EBC and ECD.

But this is getting too convoluted. Maybe I need to consider that angle 9 is an angle in one of these triangles or at a vertex.

Wait, let's think of the angles given as follows:

Angle 1 = 58°, angle 2 = 47°, angle 3 = 26°.

If these are angles in different triangles, perhaps using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, and relating them to other angles.

For example, if angle 1 is in triangle ABC, angle 2 in triangle EBC, and angle 3 in triangle ECD, and we need to find angle 9, which could be an angle in another triangle or a supplementary angle.

But without knowing which angle it is, it's hard. Maybe angle 9 is an exterior angle to one of the triangles.

For instance, if in triangle EBC, angle at E is 107° (as previously calculated), and that angle is supplementary to angle 9, then angle 9 would be 73°, which is not among the options. But none of the options are 73°, so that's not helpful.

Alternatively, if angle 9 is an angle formed by extending a side, like an exterior angle.

Wait, another approach: let's consider the sum of all angles in the figure. For example, if there are multiple triangles, their angles might add up to certain totals.

But this is too vague. Let me think about the possibilities for angle 9.

The answer choices are A. 39, B. 47, C. 49, D. 58.

Given that angle 2 is 47°, which is one of the choices, maybe angle 9 is 47°, but why?

Alternatively, if angle 9 is equal to angle 2 due to some congruence or parallel lines.

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say.

Wait, here's a new idea: since there are three triangles mentioned, ABC, EBC, and ECD, perhaps angle 9 is an angle in another triangle or at a vertex.

Let me try to calculate some angles.

Assume in triangle EBC, angle at B is 47° (angle 2), angle at C is 26° (angle 3), then angle at E is 180 - 47 - 26 = 107°. So angle at E is 107°.

Now, in triangle ECD, if angle at C is 26° (same as angle 3), then angle at E in this triangle would be... Well, if we assume that angle at E in triangle ECD is the same as the angle at E in triangle EBC (which is 107°), but that wouldn't make sense because angle at E in triangle ECD would be between EC and ED, whereas in triangle EBC it's between EB and EC. So they are different angles.

But if we assume that in triangle ECD, angle at E is 107°, then angle at D would be 180 - 107 - 26 = 47°. So angle at D is 47°, which is the same as angle 2. So angle 9 could be 47°, which is choice B.

But why would angle at D be 47°? Let me see.

If in triangle ECD, angle at D is 47°, and angle at C is 26°, and angle at E is 107°, then yes, that adds up to 180°. So angle at D is 47°, which is the same as angle 2. If angle 9 is this angle at D, then the answer would be B.

But how do I know that angle 9 is at D? Well, the problem states that angle 9 is to be found, and the answer choices include 47°, which matches angle 2. So maybe angle 9 is the same as angle 2, hence 47°.

But why would angle 9 be at D? If the figure has an angle labeled 9 at point D, which is 47°, then it would be choice B.

Alternatively, maybe angle 9 is an exterior angle. For example, if there's a triangle where one angle is 26°, another is 47°, and angle 9 is the exterior angle, which would be 26 + 47 = 73°, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, if angle 9 is an angle formed by lines EA and ED, which might be related to other angles.

But given the lack of diagram, this is speculative. However, if assuming that in triangle ECD, angle at D is 47°, which is angle 2, and that angle 9 is this angle, then answer is B.

Alternatively, if angle 9 is an angle in triangle ABC. For example, if angle at A is 58° (angle 1), angle at B is 47° (angle 2), then angle at C is 180 - 58 - 47 = 75°, which is not in the choices. But if angle 9 is this 75°, it's not an option.

Another possibility: angle 9 is the supplement of angle 1. 180 - 58 = 122, not in choices. Or angle 9 is the supplement of angle 3: 180 - 26 = 154, not in choices.

Alternatively, if angle 9 is the sum of angles 1 and 3: 58 + 26 = 84, not in choices. Or angle 9 is the difference: 58 - 26 = 32, not in choices.

Wait, but earlier calculation suggested that in triangle ECD, angle at D is 47°, which matches angle 2. If angle 9 is that angle, then the answer is B. Since 47 is one of the choices, and this fits, maybe that's the intended path.

Thus, the measure of angle 9 is 47°, which is choice B.
