====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have a triangle ABC with sides a=14, b=48, and c=50. We need to find cos A. The answer choices are A. 0.14, B. 0.48, C. 0.50, D. 0.96. 

First, I should recall how to find cosine of an angle in a triangle. Oh right, the Law of Cosines! That formula relates the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles. The formula is c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos C. Wait, but here we need to find cos A. Let me adjust that. For angle A, the formula would be a² = b² + c² - 2bc cos A. Rearranging that gives cos A = (b² + c² - a²) / (2bc). 

But wait, before jumping into calculations, I should check if the triangle is a right triangle because the given side lengths might form a Pythagorean triple. Let me see: 14² + 48² equals 196 + 2304 = 2500. And 50² is 2500. Oh, so it's a right triangle! That simplifies things because in a right triangle, the cosine of an acute angle is adjacent over hypotenuse. But first, I need to figure out which angle is the right angle. 

Looking at the given predicates, there are several RightAngle statements. Let me parse them. The first one says RightAngle(Angle(B,C,A)), which means the angle at point C between points B and A. So Angle BCA is a right angle. Similarly, RightAngle(Angle(C,B,A)) is the same as Angle at B? Wait, maybe I'm misreading. Let me think again. The syntax is Angle(X,Y,Z), which typically represents the angle at Y formed by points X-Y-Z. So Angle(B,C,A) is the angle at point C between points B and A. So that would make angle C a right angle. Then another predicate says RightAngle(Angle(B,A,C)), which is the angle at A between B and C. Wait, but if angle C is already a right angle, then angle A can't be a right angle unless the triangle is degenerate. Hmm, maybe there's some confusion here. Alternatively, perhaps the triangle has two right angles? No, that's impossible in Euclidean geometry. Maybe the predicates are indicating different aspects. 

Wait, maybe the triangle is right-angled at B? Because the second predicate is RightAngle(Angle(C,B,A)), which is angle at B between C and A. So angle at B is a right angle. But earlier, angle at C was also mentioned as a right angle. That seems conflicting. Wait, but maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check the given predicates again. The user listed three RightAngle predicates: RightAngle(Angle(B,C,A)), RightAngle(Angle(C,B,A)), and RightAngle(Angle(B,A,C)). Let me parse each:

1. RightAngle(Angle(B,C,A)): This is angle at C between B-C-A. So angle at C is right.
2. RightAngle(Angle(C,B,A)): This is angle at B between C-B-A. So angle at B is right.
3. RightAngle(Angle(B,A,C)): This is angle at A between B-A-C. So angle at A is right.

Wait, that can't be possible. A triangle can't have three right angles. So this suggests that either the problem is ill-posed, or I'm misunderstanding the predicates. However, since the side lengths are 14, 48, 50, which form a Pythagorean triple (since 14² + 48² = 50²), the triangle must be right-angled. Which angle is the right angle?

In a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is the longest side. Here, the sides are a=14, b=48, c=50. So c is the hypotenuse. Therefore, the right angle is opposite the hypotenuse. Wait, in standard notation, usually, in triangle ABC, side a is BC, side b is AC, and side c is AB. Wait, actually, the notation can vary, but generally, side a is opposite angle A, side b is opposite angle B, and side c is opposite angle C. Wait, but the problem mentions a=14, b=48, c=50. Let me clarify.

Assuming standard notation where:

- Side a is opposite angle A, so it's BC.

- Side b is opposite angle B, so it's AC.

- Side c is opposite angle C, so it's AB.

So, if the triangle is right-angled, then the hypotenuse would be the longest side, which is c=50. So the right angle is at the vertex opposite the hypotenuse. Since the hypotenuse is AB (side c), then the right angle is at C. Wait, because in a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. So if AB is the hypotenuse (c=50), then the right angle is at point C. Therefore, angle C is the right angle. 

But according to the given predicates, there are three RightAngle statements. How does that fit? Well, maybe the predicates are redundant or overlapping. For example, if the triangle is right-angled at C, then angle C is right. So the first predicate RightAngle(Angle(B,C,A)) would correspond to angle at C being right. The other predicates may be incorrect or redundant, but perhaps they are just providing extra info. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation here. Let me confirm the side lengths. Given a=14, b=48, c=50. Let's check if these satisfy Pythagoras. 14² + 48² = 196 + 2304 = 2500. 50² is 2500. Yes, so 14² + 48² = 50². Therefore, the triangle is right-angled. Therefore, the right angle is at the vertex opposite the hypotenuse. Hypotenuse is the longest side, which is c=50. Therefore, the right angle is at the vertex opposite c. In standard notation, side c is AB. So vertex C is opposite side c. Wait, no. Wait, side a is BC, side b is AC, side c is AB. Therefore, the vertices are labeled such that:

- Vertex A is connected to B and C.

- Vertex B is connected to A and C.

- Vertex C is connected to A and B.

Therefore, side a is BC (opposite angle A).

Side b is AC (opposite angle B).

Side c is AB (opposite angle C).

So the hypotenuse is AB (side c=50), so the right angle is at vertex C. Therefore, angle C is the right angle. Thus, angles A and B are acute. 

Now, the question asks for cos A. In a right-angled triangle, cos A is adjacent over hypotenuse. But which sides are adjacent to angle A?

Angle A is at vertex A. The sides adjacent to angle A are AB and AC. Wait, in triangle ABC, angle A is between sides AB and AC. Wait, but AB is the hypotenuse (length c=50), and AC is side b=48. Wait, no. Let me get this straight. 

In triangle ABC, with the right angle at C. So sides:

- AC and BC are the legs.

- AB is the hypotenuse.

Therefore, angle A is at vertex A, between AB (hypotenuse) and AC (one leg). So the adjacent side to angle A is AC (which is length b=48), and the hypotenuse is AB (length c=50). Therefore, cos A = adjacent/hypotenuse = AC / AB = b / c = 48 / 50 = 0.96. But looking at the answer choices, D is 0.96. But wait, that seems straightforward. However, let me verify with the Law of Cosines as well to ensure consistency.

Using the Law of Cosines formula:

cos A = (b² + c² - a²) / (2bc)

Wait, here, a is the side opposite angle A. Wait, in standard notation, side a is BC, which is opposite angle A. Wait, but if the triangle is right-angled at C, then side a (BC) is one leg, side b (AC) is another leg, and side c (AB) is hypotenuse. So, for angle A, the sides involved are:

Opposite side: BC = a = 14.

Adjacent sides: AB (hypotenuse) and AC (side b=48).

So applying Law of Cosines:

cos A = (b² + c² - a²)/(2bc)

Plugging in the numbers:

b=48, c=50, a=14.

So numerator: 48² + 50² - 14² = 2304 + 2500 - 196 = (2304 + 2500) = 4804; 4804 - 196 = 4608.

Denominator: 2 * 48 * 50 = 4800.

So cos A = 4608 / 4800 = divide numerator and denominator by 48: 96 / 100 = 0.96. So yes, same result. So that's 0.96, which is answer D.

Wait, but why did the problem provide those predicates about RightAngles? Like, if the triangle is right-angled at C, then the predicates would indicate that. For example, the first predicate RightAngle(Angle(B,C,A)) refers to angle at C, which is indeed the right angle. The other predicates like RightAngle(Angle(C,B,A)) which is angle at B, but that would imply angle B is right, which conflicts. Unless there's a mistake in the predicates. But maybe the user made a typo, but regardless, the side lengths confirm that it's a right-angled triangle with hypotenuse 50. Hence, angle C is right. So the calculation holds. 

Thus, the answer is D. 0.96.
