<think>
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. Hmm, so we need to find the value of x based on the given predicates. Let me start by breaking down the information provided.

First, there's a triangle QRS. The sides QR is 14 units, RS is 27 units. Then there's a point T connected to Q and S, forming lines QT and TS with lengths 2x and 17 respectively. Also, there's a circle W inscribed in triangle QRS. Points U, V, T, W, Q, R, S are mentioned, but I'm not sure about their roles yet. Wait, maybe T is a point inside the triangle since it connects to Q and S? And the circle is inscribed, so it's tangent to all three sides?

Let me visualize triangle QRS. Let me note the sides: QR = 14, RS = 27. But where is point T? Since there are lines QT and TS, T must be somewhere such that QT is connected to Q and T, and TS connects T to S. So T is probably a point along some side or inside the triangle. Wait, but if the circle is inscribed in triangle QRS, then the center W is the incenter. Maybe T is the point where the incircle touches one of the sides? Or perhaps T is another point related to the triangle's elements?

Wait, the problem mentions points U, V, T, W. But the main focus seems to be on triangle QRS with points Q, R, S, and T. Let me think. The key here might be the lengths involving T. QT is 2x and TS is 17. If T lies on RS, then QT would be a cevian, but I don't know. Alternatively, maybe T is the incenter? No, because the incenter is the intersection of angle bisectors, but the inradius is related to the area and semiperimeter. However, the problem states that the circle is inscribed in triangle QRS, so the incenter W is the center of that circle. 

Alternatively, maybe T is the point where the incircle touches a side. For example, if the incircle touches side QS at T, then QT would be a segment from Q to the touchpoint. Wait, but in standard terms, the lengths from vertices to touchpoints can be calculated using the formula: if the incircle touches side BC at D, then BD = (AB + BC - AC)/2. Similarly for other sides. 

But here, the sides QR=14, RS=27. Wait, but we need to figure out which sides are involved. Let me try to sketch mentally. Suppose triangle QRS has sides QR=14, RS=27, and QS is another side. Wait, but we don't have the length of QS directly. But we also have a point T connected to Q and S with QT=2x and TS=17. So, if T is a point on QS, then QT + TS = QS. Therefore, QS = 2x + 17. But how does this relate to the rest of the triangle?

Alternatively, maybe T is not on QS. Wait, but the lines QT and TS exist. So if T is connected to Q and S, then T could be outside the triangle? Or inside? If T is inside, then maybe QT and TS form parts of medians, angle bisectors, or altitudes. But without knowing more about T's position, it's hard to tell. However, the presence of an inscribed circle suggests that maybe T is related to the incircle. For instance, if T is the touchpoint of the incircle on side QS, then QT and TS would be the segments from Q and S to the touchpoint. In that case, QT and TS would be equal to (QR + QS - RS)/2 and similar expressions. Wait, let me recall the formula for the lengths from the vertices to the touchpoints.

For a triangle ABC, with the incircle touching side BC at D, side AC at E, and side AB at F, then the lengths are:

BD = BF = (AB + BC - AC)/2,

DC = DC = (BC + AC - AB)/2,

and similarly for others. 

So applying this to triangle QRS. Let me assume that T is the touchpoint on side QS. Then QT would be equal to (QR + QS - RS)/2. Wait, but we need to express this in terms of known quantities. However, we don't know QS yet. But we do have that QT = 2x and TS = 17. So if T is the touchpoint on QS, then QT = (QR + QS - RS)/2 and TS = (RS + QS - QR)/2. 

Wait, let me check again. Let me denote the sides:

Let’s denote the sides of triangle QRS as follows:

QR = a = 14,

RS = b = 27,

QS = c (unknown).

Then, the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.

The lengths from the vertices to the touchpoints are:

From Q to touchpoint on QS: QT = s - b.

Similarly, from S to touchpoint on QS: ST = s - a.

Wait, yes! Because the touchpoint divides the side into segments equal to s - opposite side.

So for example, the touchpoint on side QS would divide it into segments of length s - RS and s - QR.

Therefore, QT = s - RS = (a + b + c)/2 - b = (a + c - b)/2.

Similarly, TS = s - QR = (a + b + c)/2 - a = (b + c - a)/2.

Given that, in our case, QT = 2x and TS = 17. So:

QT = (QR + QS - RS)/2 = (14 + c - 27)/2 = (c - 13)/2 = 2x.

TS = (RS + QS - QR)/2 = (27 + c - 14)/2 = (c + 13)/2 = 17.

So from the second equation: (c + 13)/2 = 17 → c + 13 = 34 → c = 21. 

Then substituting back into the first equation: (21 -13)/2 = 8/2 = 4 = 2x → x = 2. Wait, but 2x equals 4, so x is 2. But none of the options is 2. That suggests my assumption that T is the touchpoint on QS is wrong. Because the answer choices are 5,7,13,14. So perhaps my assumption is incorrect.

Hmm, so maybe T isn't the touchpoint on QS. Let me re-examine the problem. The circle is inscribed in triangle QRS, so W is the incenter. Are there other possibilities for T? Maybe T is the foot of an altitude, or midpoint, or something else. 

Alternatively, perhaps T is the incenter itself? But then QT and TS would be distances from Q and S to the incenter, which aren't necessarily related in a simple way unless we use coordinates. But that might complicate things. 

Wait, another thought: maybe T is the point where the incircle touches another side. For example, suppose the incircle touches QR at T. Then QT would be part of QR. But QR is 14. Let me see. If T is the touchpoint on QR, then QT = (QR + QS - RS)/2. Wait, earlier formula applies. Let me redo the calculation. 

If T is the touchpoint on side QR, then the length from Q to T would be (QR + QS - RS)/2. Wait, but in that case, QR is 14, so QT = (QR + QS - RS)/2 = (14 + c - 27)/2 = same as before. But then TS would not be directly related. So this seems like the same scenario as before, leading to c=21, x=2, which is not among the options. Hence, contradiction.

Alternative idea: Perhaps T is not on a side of the triangle but inside, making QT and TS two segments from Q and S to T, forming a cevian. But then how can we relate these lengths? Without knowing more about T's position, it's unclear. 

Wait, maybe triangle QRT and triangle SRT? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe Stewart's theorem? Stewart's theorem relates the length of a cevian to the sides of the triangle. But to apply it, we need to know more about the triangle's sides and the cevian's position. 

But wait, if T is a point inside triangle QRS such that QT = 2x and TS = 17, but we don't know where T is located. Unless there's another condition. Wait, the circle is inscribed in triangle QRS. Is there any relation between T and the incircle? Like T being the incenter? But the incenter is a single point, W. 

Wait, looking back at the predicates, there is a point W, which is the center of the inscribed circle. So maybe T is the incenter? But then QT and TS would be the distances from Q and S to the incenter. However, calculating those requires knowing the coordinates or using trigonometry. 

Alternatively, maybe T is the excenter or something else. But this seems too vague. 

Wait, going back to the previous approach where T was the touchpoint on QS, even though it led to x=2, which isn't an option. Maybe there's a miscalculation there. Let me check again.

Assuming T is the touchpoint on QS:

We had TS = (RS + QS - QR)/2 = 17.

So plugging numbers: (27 + QS - 14)/2 = (13 + QS)/2 = 17 → 13 + QS = 34 → QS = 21. 

Then QT = (QR + QS - RS)/2 = (14 + 21 - 27)/2 = (8)/2 = 4. So QT = 4, which equals 2x, so 2x = 4 → x = 2. But 2 is not an option. So either the assumption is wrong, or there's another interpretation. 

Wait, perhaps T is not on QS but on another side? For example, if T is the touchpoint on side RS. Then, the length from R to T would be (QR + RS - QS)/2. But then QT would be different. Let me try that. 

Suppose T is the touchpoint on RS. Then RT = (QR + RS - QS)/2. But then QT is not directly a segment from Q to T. Unless T is on RS, and QT is a separate segment. This complicates things. 

Alternatively, maybe T is the touchpoint on side QR. Then, QT would be (QR + QS - RS)/2, which is same as before. Which gives us same result. 

Alternatively, maybe the given lines QT and TS are not along the sides but are cevians intersecting at T. For example, if T is the intersection point of two cevians. But without more info, it's difficult. 

Another thought: Maybe the circle is not the incircle but some other circle. But the predicate says "InscribedIn(Circle(W), Triangle(Q, R, S))", which means the circle is inscribed, i.e., it's the incircle. So W is the incenter. 

Wait, perhaps there's a mix-up in the labels. Let me check the problem statement again. It says:

- InscribedIn(Circle(W), Triangle(Q, R, S))

So the circle W is inscribed in the triangle, so W is the incenter. 

Now, considering that, and the lines QT and TS. Maybe T is the incenter? Then QT and TS would be the distances from Q to W and from S to W. But how to compute them?

Alternatively, maybe T is a typo and should be W? Or perhaps T is another point. Wait, the problem lists points Q, R, S, T, U, V, W. So T is a distinct point. 

Wait, perhaps T is the foot of the inradius on a particular side? For example, if the incircle touches side QR at T, then QT is the distance from Q to the touchpoint on QR. Which would be (QR + QS - RS)/2, same as before. Which leads us back to the same equations. 

But since that leads to x=2, which isn't an option, perhaps the error is in assuming that T is the touchpoint on QS. Let me consider another possibility. What if T is not on the side but inside the triangle, and the lines QT and TS are not along the sides. Then, how can we relate QT and TS?

Alternatively, maybe using coordinate geometry. Let's assign coordinates to the triangle and calculate. 

Let me place point Q at (0, 0), R at (14, 0) since QR is 14 units. Now, we need to find coordinates for S such that RS is 27 units. But we don't know the coordinates of S yet. Also, point T is connected to Q and S with QT = 2x and TS = 17. Also, there's an incircle centered at W. 

This might get complicated, but let's try. First, let's find coordinates for S. Let me assume triangle QRS has coordinates Q(0,0), R(14,0), and S(x,y). Then RS has length 27, so sqrt((x-14)^2 + y^2) = 27. Also, the inradius can be found via area/s. 

But without more info, this might not be helpful. However, if we can find the coordinates of the incenter W, which is at ( (aA_x + bB_x + cC_x)/(a+b+c), ... ), where a, b, c are the lengths of sides opposite to A, B, C. Wait, in standard terms, the incenter coordinates are weighted averages. 

But maybe this is getting too involved. Let me think differently. Since the incircle touches all sides, its radius r is given by r = Area / s, where s is the semi-perimeter. 

Let me denote the sides as follows: QR = a = 14, RS = b = 27, and QS = c. The semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = (14 + 27 + c)/2 = (41 + c)/2. 

The area can be found using Heron's formula: sqrt[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)]. But without knowing c, this is tricky. However, if we can relate c to the given data involving T. 

Earlier, assuming T is the touchpoint on QS gave us c = 21, leading to x=2. But since that doesn't match the options, maybe there's a different relationship. 

Wait, perhaps T is not a touchpoint but another point. Let me think about mass point or vector approaches. Alternatively, maybe the lines QT and TS form a ratio related to the sides. 

Wait, if we consider the incircle, the touchpoints divide the sides into segments. For example, on side QR, the touchpoint divides it into segments of length s - b and s - c. Similarly for other sides. But if T is not on a side, this may not apply. 

Alternatively, maybe T is the intersection of the incircle with a certain line. But without more details, it's hard to say. 

Wait, another idea: Since the circle is inscribed in the triangle, the center W is equidistant from all sides. If T is a point such that WT is perpendicular to a side, but again, not enough info. 

Alternatively, maybe the lines QT and TS are tangents to the incircle. But that would require T to be external to the circle, but since the circle is inscribed, tangents from Q and S to the circle would meet at T. Wait, but tangents from Q to the incircle would be equal in length. Let me explore this. 

The lengths of the two tangents from a point to a circle are equal. So, if T is a point outside the circle, then QT and ST would be tangents if they touch the circle. But since the incircle is already tangent to the sides, maybe T is the point where two tangents meet. 

Wait, but Q and S are vertices of the triangle, and the incircle is already tangent to the sides. The tangents from Q to the incircle would be along the sides QR and QS. Similarly for S. So if T were the intersection of two tangents from Q and S, it would be... Well, the incircle is already tangent to the sides. So the only common tangent points are the touchpoints. 

This seems to bring us back to the touchpoints. 

Alternatively, maybe T is the ex-tangent point? Or something else. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me recheck the equations. 

If T is the touchpoint on QS, then QT = s - RS = [(a + b + c)/2] - b = (a + c - b)/2. Given that QT = 2x, and TS = (b + c - a)/2 = 17. 

With a=14, b=27, then:

TS = (27 + c - 14)/2 = (13 + c)/2 = 17 ⇒ 13 + c = 34 ⇒ c = 21. 

Then QT = (14 + 21 - 27)/2 = (8)/2 = 4. So 2x = 4 ⇒ x = 2. 

But this answer isn't among the options. So why is this happening? Did I misinterpret the position of T? 

Wait, maybe the circle is not the incircle but an excircle? But the predicate says "InscribedIn(Circle(W), Triangle(Q, R, S))", which typically refers to the incircle. 

Alternatively, maybe T is not on QS but on another side. Let me try assuming T is on QR. If T is on QR, then QT would be a portion of QR. Let's say QT = 2x, and since QR = 14, then 2x ≤ 14 ⇒ x ≤ 7. Then, TS = 17. But how does TS come into play? If T is on QR, then TS would be a line from T to S, which is outside the triangle. This seems less likely. 

Alternatively, T is on RS. Then, RT would be some value, and TS = 17. Let's try that. Let me suppose T is on RS such that RT = d, TS = 17. Then RS = RT + TS = d + 17 = 27 ⇒ d = 10. So RT = 10. Now, if T is on RS, then QT is a cevian from Q to T on RS. To find QT's length, we could use Stewart's theorem. 

Stewart's theorem states that for a triangle with side lengths a, b, c, and a cevian of length d dividing the side into m and n, then b²m + c²n = a(d² + mn). 

In this case, triangle QRS, with cevian QT to side RS. Wait, RS is divided into RT = 10 and TS = 17, so total RS = 27. 

Applying Stewart's theorem:

QR² * TS + QS² * RT = RS*(QT² + RT*TS)

Wait, let me define variables properly. 

Let me denote:

Side QR = a = 14,

Side RS = b = 27,

Side QS = c (unknown),

Cevian QT = d = 2x,

Dividing RS into RT = 10 and TS = 17.

Wait, Stewart's formula is: 

For triangle QRS, with cevian QT to side RS, splitting it into RT = m = 10 and TS = n = 17. Then:

QR² * n + QS² * m = RS*(QT² + m*n)

Plugging in:

QR² * n = 14² * 17 = 196 * 17 = 3332

QS² * m = c² * 10

RS*(QT² + m*n) = 27*( (2x)^2 + 10*17 ) = 27*(4x² + 170)

Thus:

3332 + 10c² = 27*(4x² + 170)

But we have two unknowns here: c and x. Need another equation. 

But we also know that in triangle QRS, by the Law of Cosines or Law of Cosines, but without knowing angles, it's tough. Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that the circle is inscribed. 

Wait, the incircle exists, so the semi-perimeter s = (14 + 27 + c)/2 = (41 + c)/2.

Also, the area of the triangle is r*s, where r is the inradius. But we don't know r or the area. However, using Heron's formula, the area squared is s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c). 

But this seems too many variables. 

Alternatively, since we have the cevian QT = 2x, and from Stewart's theorem, we have:

3332 + 10c² = 27*(4x² + 170)

But we need another equation relating c and x. 

Maybe using the Law of Cosines on triangle QTS or something. Let me think. 

Alternatively, maybe the position of T being on RS allows us to use the fact that the incircle is present. For example, if T is the touchpoint on RS, then RT = s - QS. Wait, earlier formulas: for touchpoint on RS, RT = (QR + RS - QS)/2. 

If T is the touchpoint on RS, then RT = (QR + RS - QS)/2. 

Given that RT = 10, then:

(14 + 27 - c)/2 = 10 ⇒ 41 - c = 20 ⇒ c = 21. 

Then QS = 21. 

Now, with c = 21, we can substitute back into the equation from Stewart's theorem. 

So, 3332 + 10*(21)^2 = 27*(4x² + 170)

Calculate left side:

10*(21)^2 = 10*441 = 4410

So total left side: 3332 + 4410 = 7742

Right side: 27*(4x² + 170) = 27*4x² + 27*170 = 108x² + 4590

Set equal:

7742 = 108x² + 4590

Subtract 4590:

7742 - 4590 = 3152 = 108x²

So x² = 3152 / 108 ≈ 29.185...

Which is approximately 29.185, so x ≈ 5.4. This is close to option A (5) or B (7). But not exact. Hmm. 

But this assumes that T is the touchpoint on RS, which would make RT = s - QS = 10. But this gives x ≈ 5.4, which isn't an integer. Since the options are integers, this suggests that my assumption is still incorrect. 

Wait, but maybe I made a calculation error. Let me recalculate:

Left side: 3332 + 10*(21)^2

21^2 is 441, times 10 is 4410. 3332 + 4410 = 7742. Correct.

Right side: 27*(4x² + 170) = 108x² + 4590.

So 108x² = 7742 - 4590 = 3152.

x² = 3152 / 108. Let me compute that fraction:

Divide numerator and denominator by 4: 788 / 27. 

788 ÷ 27 ≈ 29.185. So x ≈ √29.185 ≈ 5.4. Still not matching the options. 

Hmm, this suggests that T is not on RS. 

Let me try another approach. Maybe T is the incenter? Let's assume T is the incenter W. Then, the distances from T to the sides are equal to the inradius r. But how does that relate to QT and TS? 

If T is the incenter, then QT is the distance from Q to W. To calculate this, we can use coordinates or formulas. 

Let me try coordinates again. Let's assume Q(0,0), R(14,0), and S(x,y). We need to find coordinates of S such that RS = 27. Let me choose coordinates for simplicity. 

Let me set Q at (0,0), R at (14,0). Let S be at (p,q). Then RS length is sqrt((p-14)^2 + q^2) = 27. 

The incenter W has coordinates ((aA_x + bB_x + cC_x)/(a+b+c), (aA_y + bB_y + cC_y)/(a+b+c)), where a, b, c are the lengths of sides opposite to A, B, C. Wait, in standard terms, the incenter coordinates are ( (aAx + bBx + cCx)/(a+b+c), ... ). Wait, actually, the formula is weighted by the lengths of the sides. 

Wait, for triangle ABC, with side lengths a = BC, b = AC, c = AB. Then the incenter coordinates are ( (aAx + bBx + cCx)/(a+b+c), ... ). Wait, no, it's weighted by the lengths of the sides opposite to the respective vertices. 

Actually, the incenter coordinates are given by ( (a x_A + b x_B + c x_C)/(a + b + c), (a y_A + b y_B + c y_C)/(a + b + c) ), where a is the length opposite vertex A, etc. 

So in our case, triangle QRS. Let's define:

Vertex Q: (0,0)

Vertex R: (14,0)

Vertex S: (p,q)

Side lengths:

QR = 14 (opposite S)

RS = 27 (opposite Q)

QS = c (opposite R)

So the incenter W has coordinates:

W_x = (QR * x_Q + RS * x_R + QS * x_S) / (QR + RS + QS)

Similarly for W_y.

Plugging in:

W_x = (14*0 + 27*14 + c*p) / (14 + 27 + c)

W_y = (14*0 + 27*0 + c*q) / (14 + 27 + c) = (c*q) / (41 + c)

But this seems complex without knowing p, q, or c. 

However, the distance from Q to W (which is QT if T is the incenter) would be sqrt(W_x^2 + W_y^2). This seems too abstract. 

Alternatively, maybe using the formula for the distance from a vertex to the incenter. There's a formula: the distance from vertex A to the incenter is sqrt(r^2 + (s - a)^2), where r is the inradius and s is the semi-perimeter. 

Yes! This formula might work. Let me recall: In a triangle, the distance from vertex A to the incenter can be expressed as sqrt[r² + (s - a)²], where s is the semi-perimeter, and a is the side opposite vertex A. 

So if T is the incenter W, then QT = sqrt[r² + (s - a)^2]. Similarly, ST = sqrt[r² + (s - b)^2] if T is the incenter. Wait, but ST would depend on which vertex we're measuring. 

Wait, let's clarify. For vertex Q, the distance to incenter W is sqrt[r² + (s - QR)^2], since the side opposite Q is RS, which has length 27. So a = RS = 27. Thus, QT = sqrt[r² + (s - a)^2] = sqrt[r² + (s - 27)^2].

Similarly, the distance from S to W would be sqrt[r² + (s - QR)^2], since the side opposite S is QR = 14. So ST = sqrt[r² + (s - 14)^2]. 

But according to the problem, QT = 2x and TS = 17. So we have:

sqrt[r² + (s - 27)^2] = 2x ...(1)

sqrt[r² + (s - 14)^2] = 17 ...(2)

Let me square both equations:

(1): r² + (s - 27)^2 = 4x² ...(1a)

(2): r² + (s - 14)^2 = 289 ...(2a)

Subtracting (1a) - (2a):

[r² + (s - 27)^2] - [r² + (s - 14)^2] = 4x² - 289

Expand the squares:

[(s - 27)^2 - (s - 14)^2] = 4x² - 289

Using difference of squares: [ (s - 27) - (s - 14) ] * [ (s - 27) + (s - 14) ] = 4x² - 289

Compute each part:

First factor: (s - 27 - s + 14) = (-13)

Second factor: (s - 27 + s - 14) = 2s - 41

So overall: -13*(2s - 41) = 4x² - 289

=> -26s + 533 = 4x² - 289

Rearranged:

-26s = 4x² - 289 - 533

=> -26s = 4x² - 822

=> 26s = -4x² + 822

=> s = (-4x² + 822)/26

But s is the semi-perimeter, which is (14 + 27 + c)/2 = (41 + c)/2. So:

s = (41 + c)/2 = (-4x² + 822)/26

Multiply both sides by 26:

26*(41 + c)/2 = -4x² + 822

=> 13*(41 + c) = -4x² + 822

=> 533 + 13c = -4x² + 822

=> 13c = -4x² + 822 - 533 = -4x² + 289

=> c = (-4x² + 289)/13

Now, we also know from the semi-perimeter expression:

s = (41 + c)/2 = (-4x² + 822)/26

Let me verify this. From above, s = (41 + c)/2, and from the other expression, s = (-4x² + 822)/26. So setting equal:

(41 + c)/2 = (-4x² + 822)/26

Multiply both sides by 26:

13*(41 + c) = -4x² + 822

Which is the same as before. So we have c = (-4x² + 289)/13.

Now, let's use the second equation (2a): r² + (s - 14)^2 = 289.

We also know that r = Area / s. And from Heron's formula, Area = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)].

But this might be too complex. Alternatively, we can use the relation between r and the sides. 

But let me try to express r in terms of x. 

From equation (2a): r² = 289 - (s - 14)^2.

Also, from equation (1a): r² = 4x² - (s - 27)^2.

Setting them equal:

289 - (s - 14)^2 = 4x² - (s - 27)^2

Which is the same as before, leading to the same relation. So this doesn't give new information. 

But we also have c = (-4x² + 289)/13. Let me plug this into the semi-perimeter expression. 

s = (41 + c)/2 = [41 + (-4x² + 289)/13]/2 = [ (41*13 -4x² + 289)/13 ] / 2 = [ (533 + 289 -4x²)/13 ] / 2 = (822 -4x²)/26. 

Wait, which is consistent with earlier. 

But how to proceed? We need another equation involving x. Perhaps using the fact that the area can also be expressed as r*s. 

But without knowing the area, it's challenging. 

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that c is positive. Since c = (-4x² + 289)/13 > 0, so -4x² + 289 > 0 → x² < 289/4 → x < 17/2 = 8.5. So x can be up to 8.5, which includes options A (5), B (7), C (13), D (14). Wait, but 13 and 14 are larger than 8.5, so they are invalid. So possible options are A or B. 

But how to find x? Let me think. 

We also know that the area of the triangle can be expressed as r*s, and also via Heron's formula. Let me write that:

Area = r*s = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)]

But from equation (2a), we have r² = 289 - (s - 14)^2. So r = sqrt[289 - (s - 14)^2]. 

So:

r*s = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)]

Square both sides:

r² * s² = s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)

Cancel s (assuming s ≠ 0):

r² * s = (s - a)(s - b)(s - c)

Substitute r² from equation (2a):

[289 - (s - 14)^2] * s = (s - a)(s - b)(s - c)

Let me substitute a = 27 (side opposite Q), b = 14 (side opposite R?), wait need to clarify. 

Wait, in our earlier setup, a, b, c are the sides opposite to vertices Q, R, S. Wait, no. Earlier, when defining the incenter formula, I said:

For triangle QRS, with side lengths:

QR = 14 (this is side opposite S)

RS = 27 (side opposite Q)

QS = c (side opposite R)

So, a = RS = 27 (opposite Q), b = QS = c (opposite R), and c = QR = 14 (opposite S)? No, wait, this is confusing. Let me redefine:

In standard terms, for triangle ABC, side a is BC, side b is AC, side c is AB. So for triangle QRS:

Let me denote:

- Side opposite Q is RS = 27, call this a = 27

- Side opposite R is QS = c, call this b = c

- Side opposite S is QR = 14, call this c = 14

Wait, this is conflicting. Let me use standard notation. Let me call the sides as follows:

Let me denote:

- Length of QR = a = 14

- Length of RS = b = 27

- Length of QS = c (unknown)

Then, the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = (14 + 27 + c)/2 = (41 + c)/2.

The inradius r = Area / s.

Now, using the formula for the distance from Q to the incenter: QT = sqrt[r² + (s - a)^2] = sqrt[r² + (s - 14)^2] = 2x.

And from the other equation, ST = sqrt[r² + (s - b)^2] = sqrt[r² + (s - 27)^2] = 17.

Wait, earlier I had ST as sqrt[r² + (s - 14)^2], but that depends on which vertex. Let me double-check.

The distance from S to the incenter: the formula is sqrt[r² + (s - opposite_side)^2]. The side opposite to S is QR = a = 14. So the distance from S to incenter is sqrt[r² + (s - a)^2] = sqrt[r² + (s - 14)^2]. Wait, but earlier I had ST = 17, so:

sqrt[r² + (s - 14)^2] = 17.

But earlier, I had another equation: sqrt[r² + (s - 27)^2] = 2x.

Wait, no, I think I mixed up. Let me clarify:

If QT is the distance from Q to incenter, then it's sqrt[r² + (s - a)^2], where a is the side opposite Q. The side opposite Q is RS = 27. So:

QT = sqrt[r² + (s - 27)^2] = 2x.

ST is the distance from S to incenter. The side opposite S is QR = 14. So:

ST = sqrt[r² + (s - 14)^2] = 17.

Ah, this is different from what I wrote earlier. So correcting that:

Equation (1): sqrt[r² + (s - 27)^2] = 2x

Equation (2): sqrt[r² + (s - 14)^2] = 17

So squaring both:

(1): r² + (s - 27)^2 = 4x²

(2): r² + (s - 14)^2 = 289

Subtracting (1) - (2):

[s - 27]^2 - [s - 14]^2 = 4x² - 289

Expanding:

[s² - 54s + 729] - [s² - 28s + 196] = 4x² - 289

Simplify:

s² -54s + 729 - s² + 28s - 196 = 4x² - 289

Combine terms:

(-26s) + 533 = 4x² - 289

Rearrange:

-26s = 4x² - 289 - 533 => -26s = 4x² - 822

Thus:

s = (822 - 4x²)/26

Now, s is also equal to (14 + 27 + c)/2 = (41 + c)/2.

So:

(41 + c)/2 = (822 - 4x²)/26

Multiply both sides by 26:

13(41 + c) = 822 - 4x²

Expand:

533 + 13c = 822 - 4x²

Thus:

13c = 822 - 4x² - 533 = 289 - 4x²

So c = (289 - 4x²)/13

Now, we can also use the expression for r² from equation (2):

r² = 289 - (s - 14)^2

But also, r = Area / s, and Area = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where a = 27, b = 14, c = c.

Wait, let me clarify: the sides are a = 27, b = 14, c = c (the third side). So:

Area = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)]

But s = (a + b + c)/2 = (27 + 14 + c)/2 = (41 + c)/2.

So, let's compute s - a = (41 + c)/2 - 27 = (41 + c - 54)/2 = (c - 13)/2

s - b = (41 + c)/2 - 14 = (41 + c - 28)/2 = (c + 13)/2

s - c = (41 + c)/2 - c = (41 - c)/2

Thus, Area = sqrt[s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)] = sqrt[ ( (41 + c)/2 ) * ( (c - 13)/2 ) * ( (c + 13)/2 ) * ( (41 - c)/2 ) ]

Simplify:

Inside the square root: [ (41 + c)(41 - c) * (c + 13)(c - 13) ] / 16

Which is [ (41² - c²) * (c² - 169) ] / 16

So Area = sqrt[ (1681 - c²)(c² - 169) ] / 4

But also, r = Area / s, so r = [ sqrt(...)/4 ] / [ (41 + c)/2 ] = [ sqrt(...) ] / [ 2(41 + c) ]

But from equation (2), r² = 289 - (s - 14)^2

Let me compute (s - 14):

s - 14 = (41 + c)/2 - 14 = (41 + c - 28)/2 = (c + 13)/2

So (s - 14)^2 = (c + 13)^2 / 4

Thus, r² = 289 - (c + 13)^2 / 4

On the other hand, r² = [ (1681 - c²)(c² - 169) ] / [ 4(41 + c)^2 ] 

Wait, let me recompute r² from Area:

r = Area / s = [ sqrt((1681 - c²)(c² - 169))/4 ] / [ (41 + c)/2 ] = [ sqrt((1681 - c²)(c² - 169)) / 4 ] * 2/(41 + c) = sqrt((1681 - c²)(c² - 169)) / [ 2(41 + c) ]

Thus, r² = (1681 - c²)(c² - 169) / [4(41 + c)^2]

Now, equating this to 289 - (c + 13)^2 / 4:

(1681 - c²)(c² - 169) / [4(41 + c)^2] = 289 - (c + 13)^2 / 4

Multiply both sides by 4(41 + c)^2 to eliminate denominators:

(1681 - c²)(c² - 169) = 4(41 + c)^2 * 289 - (c + 13)^2 * (41 + c)^2

This looks very complex. Let me simplify term by term. 

First, note that 1681 = 41², so 1681 - c² = (41 - c)(41 + c)

Also, c² - 169 = (c - 13)(c + 13)

So the left-hand side becomes:

(41 - c)(41 + c)(c - 13)(c + 13
