<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, we have three circles: A, B, and C. Their diameters are given as 10, 30, and 10 units respectively. We need to find the length of YW, given that AZ is congruent to CW and CW equals 2. 

First, I need to recall some basics about circles. The diameter of a circle is twice the radius. So, for circle A, since its diameter is 10, the radius would be 5 units. Similarly, circle B has a diameter of 30, so its radius is 15 units. Circle C also has a diameter of 10, so radius 5 units. 

Now, looking at the points mentioned. There's a point E and a line ED. Points A, X, B, Y, C, D lie on this line ED. Also, several points lie on different circles. For example, E lies on circle A, A lies on circle A, X lies on circle A, B lies on circle B, Y lies on circle B, C lies on circle C, D lies on circle C. 

Wait, but how do these points relate? Let me parse the predicates again. 

PointLiesOnCircle(E, Circle(A)) means E is on circle A. Similarly, PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(E,D)), which suggests that E is one endpoint of line ED, and D is another. Then, other points like A, X, B, Y, C, D lie on this same line ED. So line ED contains points E, A, X, B, Y, C, D. Wait, but how are they ordered? Since E is connected to D, and points are lying on this line. 

Also, the problem mentions AZ is congruent to CW, and CW is 2. Let me note that. So, AZ ≅ CW, and CW = 2. Therefore, AZ must also be 2. But where are points A and Z? Wait, the points given are E, D, A, X, B, Y, C, W, Z. Hmm, maybe Z is another point? Wait, the initial list includes Point(Z), so Z is a point. 

But how does Z fit into this? Let me think. The line ED has points E, A, X, B, Y, C, D. Are there other points? Like W and Z? Maybe W is another point on the line? Or perhaps part of a circle?

Wait, the problem says "Find YW". So Y and W are two points whose distance we need to find. Let me check where W is. The predicates mention Point(W). Also, the line ED has points up to D. Are there any relations involving W? 

Looking back at the predicates: PointLiesOnCircle(C, Circle(C))? Wait, the initial list includes Point(C) and Point(D) on Circle(C). Also, PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(E,D)), so C is on line ED. Similarly, D is on line ED. So, points on line ED include E, A, X, B, Y, C, D, and possibly others. 

Now, the problem states that AZ ≅ CW, and CW = 2. So first, let's figure out what AZ and CW refer to. Since A is a point on line ED (as per PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(E,D))), and Z is another point. But wait, Z wasn't mentioned before except as a point. So maybe Z is another point on line ED? Or maybe it's related to a circle?

Alternatively, since there are circles involved, maybe Z is a point on one of the circles? Let me check. The points on circle A are E, A, X. On circle B: B, Y. On circle C: C, D. So Z isn't directly mentioned here. Unless Z is another point on a circle? Not sure yet. 

But the key is that AZ ≅ CW, and CW = 2. So let's consider that. Let me try to visualize the line ED with points E, A, X, B, Y, C, D. Suppose these points are arranged along the line in order. Let me try to imagine their positions. 

Since E is on circle A, and A is also on circle A. So the center of circle A is probably one of these points? Wait, the circle A has points E and A on it. Wait, but the center of a circle is not necessarily one of the points unless specified. However, in standard terms, the center would be the midpoint between two endpoints of a diameter. But if E and A are points on circle A, then the line EA could be a chord, not necessarily a diameter. However, since the diameter of circle A is 10, the radius is 5. So the distance between E and A should be less than or equal to the diameter, depending on their positions. 

But perhaps the line ED passes through the centers of the circles? Let me think. For example, since points E and D are endpoints of the line ED, and points A, X, B, Y, C, D are on this line. Let's suppose that the line ED is a straight line passing through various points. Now, considering that A lies on circle A. Wait, but circle A's center isn't specified. However, if E is on circle A, then the distance from the center of circle A to E is equal to the radius. Similarly, if A is on circle A, then the distance from the center of circle A to A is also equal to the radius. Therefore, E and A are both points on circle A, so they are equidistant from the center of circle A. Thus, the center of circle A would be the midpoint of segment EA. Similarly, for other circles. 

So, for circle A, the center would be the midpoint of EA. Similarly, for circle B, since points B and Y are on circle B, the center would be the midpoint of BY. For circle C, points C and D are on circle C, so the center is the midpoint of CD. 

Given that, perhaps the centers of the circles are midpoints of certain segments. Now, the problem mentions that AZ ≅ CW. So AZ is a segment from A to Z, and CW is from C to W. Given that CW = 2. Let me think about where Z and W are located. 

But first, let's try to find coordinates for these points. Maybe assigning coordinate system would help. Let me assume that line ED is horizontal for simplicity. Let me set coordinates such that point E is at (0, 0) and D is at (d, 0) for some d. Then, points A, X, B, Y, C, D lie along this line. 

Let me start by determining the positions of points on line ED. Let's denote the coordinates:

E is at (0, 0). D is at (d, 0). Now, points on line ED include A, X, B, Y, C, D. Let me try to find their positions. 

For circle A: points E and A are on circle A. The radius of circle A is 5. So the distance between E and A is equal to the diameter if they are endpoints of a diameter. Wait, but if E and A are both on circle A, then the distance between them is 2r_A or less. Wait, but since E and A are both on the circle, the maximum distance between them would be the diameter. So if they are endpoints of a diameter, then EA would be the diameter. But if they aren't, then EA is just a chord. 

However, without more info, maybe we can assume that EA is a diameter? Because otherwise, we don't know where the center is. Alternatively, since A is a point on circle A, and E is also on circle A, then the center of circle A is somewhere on the perpendicular bisector of EA. But since all points are on line ED, the perpendicular bisector would be vertical if ED is horizontal. But since the center of circle A must lie on this perpendicular bisector, but the line ED is horizontal, the center would be off the line ED unless EA is a diameter. Otherwise, the center wouldn't be on ED. 

Therefore, it's likely that EA is a diameter of circle A, making the center the midpoint of EA. Similarly for other circles. 

So for circle A: diameter EA implies that the length of EA is 10 (since diameter is 10). So if E is at (0, 0), then A would be at (10, 0), making the center at (5, 0). But wait, but then point X is also on circle A. If X is on line ED, then X would be another point on the circle. Let me check. 

If circle A has center at (5, 0) and radius 5, then points on circle A would satisfy (x - 5)^2 + y^2 = 25. Since all points are on line ED (the x-axis), y=0. So substituting y=0, we get (x - 5)^2 = 25 → x -5 = ±5 → x=10 or x=0. Therefore, points E(0,0) and A(10,0) are on circle A. But there's also point X on circle A. Since X is on line ED, which is the x-axis, X must also be either E or A. But the predicate says PointLiesOnCircle(X, Circle(A)). So X is another point on circle A, but according to our assumption, there are only two points on line ED that are on circle A: E and A. Hence, X must be one of those. But the predicate lists X as a separate point. This suggests that my assumption that EA is the diameter may be incorrect. 

Hmm, this is conflicting. Let me re-examine the problem. 

We have circle A with points E and A on it. Also, X is on circle A. So there are three points on circle A: E, A, X. That would imply that either E, A, X are colinear on the circle (so they lie on a straight line, i.e., the line ED). Which would mean that line ED intersects circle A at three points? But a line can intersect a circle at at most two points. Therefore, contradiction. Hence, my earlier assumption that EA is a diameter is wrong. 

So that suggests that points E, A, and X are not colinear on the circle. Wait, but they are all on line ED. Therefore, if line ED intersects circle A at three points, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be something wrong here. 

Wait, the problem says PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(E,D)), which means E is on the line ED. Similarly, PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(E,D)), so A is also on line ED. And PointLiesOnLine(X, Line(E,D)), so X is on the same line. Therefore, E, A, X are all on line ED. But they are also on circle A. Therefore, line ED intersects circle A at three points: E, A, X. But a line can intersect a circle at most two times. Therefore, this seems impossible. 

This suggests that there's an error in my understanding. Perhaps some of these points are the same? For instance, maybe X is the same as A or E? But the problem lists them as distinct points. 

Wait, maybe the line ED is tangent to circle A at point E, and also passes through A and X? No, because a tangent line touches the circle at only one point. So if ED is tangent at E, then it cannot pass through another point on the circle unless it's the same point. 

Alternatively, maybe E is the center of circle A? But then if E were the center, then points A and X would be on the circle, so EA and EX would be radii. But then, since E is the center, the line ED would pass through the center. However, the problem says E is on circle A, so if E is the center, then the radius would be zero, which doesn't make sense. 

This is confusing. Let me check the original predicates again. 

The predicates say:

PointLiesOnCircle(E, Circle(A)) – so E is on circle A.

PointLiesOnCircle(A, Circle(A)) – so A is on circle A.

PointLiesOnCircle(X, Circle(A)) – so X is on circle A.

Thus, three distinct points on circle A: E, A, X. All lying on line ED. Which is impossible unless two of them coincide. But the problem lists them as distinct points. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my interpretation. 

Wait, maybe the line ED is not a straight line? But the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(E,D)), implying that ED is a straight line. 

Alternatively, perhaps the line ED is not unique? Or maybe there are multiple lines? No, the name Line(E,D) refers to the line connecting E and D. 

This seems contradictory. How can three distinct points on a line lie on the same circle? They can only if they are the same point, which they are not. Therefore, there must be an error in my assumptions. 

Wait, perhaps E is not on the line ED? But the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(E,D)), which means E is on line ED. So that's fixed. 

Alternatively, maybe the points are not all distinct? For example, maybe X is the same as A or E. But the problem lists them as separate points. 

Wait, the problem statement includes Point(E), Point(A), Point(Z), Point(X), Point(B), Point(Y), Point(C), Point(W), Point(D). So each of these is a distinct point. Therefore, E, A, X are distinct points on line ED, all lying on circle A. Which is impossible unless circle A has infinite points on the line ED. Which is true, but for a circle, a line can intersect it in at most two points. Hence, contradiction. 

Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding. Let me go back to the problem's given predicates. 

Ah! Wait, the problem mentions Circle(A), Circle(B), Circle(C). So each circle has its own center. For example, circle A has center O_A, circle B has O_B, etc. The points listed on the circles are points on the circumference. So, for example, point E is on circle A, which means it's on the circumference of circle A. Similarly, point A is on circle A, so it's also on the circumference. So, two distinct points on circle A: E and A. Then, point X is also on circle A. So three distinct points on circle A. Which is only possible if the line ED is a secant line passing through the circle A at three points, which is impossible. 

This suggests that there's a mistake in the problem setup, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the predicates. 

Wait, maybe some of the points are not on the line ED? Let me check again. 

The predicates say:

PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(E,D)) – yes, E is on the line ED.

PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(E,D)) – yes, A is on the line ED.

PointLiesOnLine(X, Line(E,D)) – yes, X is on the line ED.

Similarly for B, Y, C, D. So all these points are on the same line ED. 

So, three points E, A, X on line ED are also on circle A. Which is impossible unless the line ED is tangent to the circle at one point and passes through another, but even then, only two intersection points. 

Wait, unless E and A are the same point? But the problem lists them as separate points. 

This seems like a paradox. Let me check the original problem again. 

Wait, the user wrote: 

"Circle(A)
Circle(B)
Circle(C)
Point(E)
Point(A)
Point(Z)
Point(X)
Point(B)
Point(Y)
Point(C)
Point(W)
Point(D)
Line(E,D)
PointLiesOnCircle(E,Circle(A))
PointLiesOnCircle(A,Circle(A))
PointLiesOnCircle(X,Circle(A))
PointLiesOnCircle(B,Circle(B))
PointLiesOnCircle(Y,Circle(B))
PointLiesOnCircle(C,Circle(C))
PointLiesOnCircle(D,Circle(C))
PointLiesOnLine(E,Line(E,D))
PointLiesOnLine(A,Line(E,D))
PointLiesOnLine(X,Line(E,D))
PointLiesOnLine(B,Line(E,D))
PointLiesOnLine(Y,Line(E,D))
PointLiesOnLine(C,Line(E,D))
PointLiesOnLine(D,Line(E,D))"

So, the key thing is that Point(A) is a point, and Circle(A) is a circle. So, the point A is on circle A. So, the circle A has a point named A on it. Which means that the center of circle A is not the point A itself, because otherwise, the radius would be zero. 

So, the circle A has a radius of 5 (since diameter is 10). The point A is on circle A, so the distance from the center of circle A to point A is 5. Similarly, point E is on circle A, so the distance from the center of circle A to E is 5. And point X is on circle A, so same distance. 

But all three points E, A, X are on line ED. So, three points on a line, each at distance 5 from the center of circle A. 

This suggests that the center of circle A is somewhere off the line ED, and the line ED passes through three points at distance 5 from the center. But this is only possible if the line ED is such that it passes through three points lying on a circle of radius 5 centered at some point off the line. 

But how can three points on a line be equidistant from a single point not on the line? It depends on the position of the center. For example, if the center is at some point off the line ED, then the line ED would be a chord of the circle A, and the three points E, A, X would lie on this chord. However, a chord can have infinitely many points, but for three distinct points to be equidistant from the center, they would have to be symmetrically placed. 

Wait, but if the center is at a distance h from the line ED, then the maximum number of points on ED that are at distance r from the center is two: the two points where the line ED intersects the circle. So, for example, the line ED would intersect circle A at two points, say P and Q. Any other point on ED would not be on the circle. So, how can E, A, and X all be on circle A and on ED? It's only possible if E, A, and X are the same point, which contradicts the problem's listing of them as distinct points. 

This suggests that there's a fundamental inconsistency in the problem's setup, but since it's a math problem, there must be a way to interpret it correctly. 

Perhaps the confusion comes from the fact that the point A is both a point and the name of the circle. Maybe the circle A has center at point A? Let's explore that possibility. 

If the center of circle A is at point A, then the radius would be the distance from A to any point on the circle. For example, point E is on circle A, so AE would be the radius. Similarly, AX would be the radius. So, if the center is at A, then E and X are points on the circle centered at A, meaning that AE = AX = radius. But then, since E and X are on line ED, and A is the center, the line ED would pass through A, and E and X would be on opposite sides of A. 

In this case, the diameter of circle A would be the distance between E and X, which would be twice the radius. So, if diameter is 10, then radius is 5. So, AE = AX = 5. Thus, the length from A to E is 5, and from A to X is 5. So, E and X are on opposite sides of A, each at distance 5 from A. 

But then, the line ED would pass through A, with E and X on either side. However, the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(E,D)), which means E is on line ED. Similarly, point A is on line ED. So, if A is between E and D, then line ED goes from E through A to D. In this case, X would be on the extension of ED beyond A, or on the other side. 

But how does this fit with the other points? Let's try to outline this scenario. 

Assume circle A has center at point A, radius 5. So, points E and X are on circle A, hence AE = 5 and AX = 5. So, E and X are each 5 units away from A on line ED. Depending on direction, E could be on one side of A, and X on the other. 

Then, for circle B: points B and Y are on circle B. Assuming similar logic, if the center of circle B is at B, then BY would be the diameter. But the diameter of circle B is 30, so radius is 15. Hence, the distance from B to Y is 30. 

Similarly, for circle C, points C and D are on circle C. If the center is at C, then CD is the diameter, which would be 10, so radius 5. Hence, CD = 10. 

But wait, the diameter of circle C is 10, so radius is 5. So, if C is the center, then CD would be the diameter, making CD = 10. Therefore, the distance between C and D is 10. 

Now, the problem states that CW = 2. So, point C is on circle C, and W is some point. Since CW is a segment from C to W, and its length is 2. 

But where is W? The problem asks for YW. So, we need to find the distance between Y and W. 

Given that, let's try to map out the positions. 

Starting with circle A: center at A, radius 5. Points E and X are on circle A, so AE = 5 and AX = 5. So, if line ED goes through A, E, and D, then E is one side of A, and D is further along the line. 

For circle C: center at C, radius 5. Points C and D are on circle C, so CD = 10 (diameter). So, the distance from C to D is 10. So, D is 10 units away from C. 

Now, the line ED contains points E, A, X, B, Y, C, D. 

Let me try to arrange these points along line ED. Let's assume the order is E --- A --- X --- B --- Y --- C --- D. 

But need to verify consistency with the distances. 

From circle A: AE = 5. So, from E to A is 5 units. From A to X is also 5 units (since X is on circle A, and if center is A, then AX = 5). 

From circle B: diameter is 30, so radius 15. Assume center is at B. Then, BY is the diameter, so BY = 30. So, the distance from B to Y is 30. 

From circle C: diameter is 10, so CD = 10. As above. 

Now, the problem says that AZ ≅ CW and CW = 2. So, AZ = 2. 

Where is Z? The problem mentions Point(Z). Since all other points are on line ED, perhaps Z is also on line ED? Or elsewhere? 

Assuming Z is on line ED, then AZ would be a segment from A to Z on the line. 

Given that, let's try to find coordinates. Let's assign coordinates to points on line ED. Let's take line ED as the x-axis. 

Let me define coordinates:

Let’s place point A at origin (0,0). Since circle A has center at A, radius 5. So, points E and X are on circle A, so they are at distance 5 from A. Let's assume E is at (-5, 0) and X is at (5, 0). 

Then, line ED extends from E(-5,0) through A(0,0) to D. 

Next, circle B has diameter 30, so radius 15. Assume center at B. Points B and Y are on circle B. So, BY = 30. Let's determine where B is. 

Assuming B is on line ED. Let me see. The line ED includes points B. So, B is somewhere on the line. Let me try to find its position. 

But how? Let's think. 

We need to find the position of B. Since B is on line ED, and it's the center of circle B. Wait, if the center of circle B is at B, then the diameter BY is 30. So, the distance from B to Y is 30. So, Y is 30 units away from B on line ED. 

Similarly, circle C has diameter CD = 10, so center at C, so C is the center, and D is 10 units away from C. 

Now, let's try to piece together the positions. 

Let me assume that points are arranged along line ED in this order: E(-5,0), A(0,0), X(5,0), then B, Y, C, D. 

But need to ensure that B is the center of circle B, so BY = 30. So, if B is at some position on the line, then Y is 30 units away from B. 

Let me attempt to find coordinates for B. 

Suppose B is at position (p, 0). Then Y would be at p + 30 or p - 30. 

Similarly, for circle C, center at C, so D is 10 units away from C. So if C is at (q, 0), then D is at q + 10 or q - 10. 

Additionally, since D is on line ED, which extends from E(-5,0) through A(0,0), X(5,0), and so on. 

Let me try to connect these. 

First, let's handle circle C: points C and D are on circle C, diameter CD = 10. So, if C is at (q,0), then D is at q + 10 or q - 10. 

Assuming that D is after C on the line ED. So, if C is at position c, then D is at c + 10. 

Now, the line ED starts at E(-5,0), goes through A(0,0), X(5,0), then continues to B, Y, C, D. 

Let me try to find the position of B. 

Assume that B is somewhere after X(5,0). Let's say B is at position b. Then Y is at b + 30 or b - 30. But since Y is on line ED, which extends to the right from X(5,0), we'll assume Y is to the right of B. So, Y would be at b + 30. 

Now, where is C? Let's say C is at position c, then D is at c + 10. 

Now, the line ED includes points E(-5), A(0), X(5), B(b), Y(b+30), C(c), D(c+10). 

But we also need to ensure that C and D are part of the line ED. So, after Y, we have C and D. 

Let me try to connect these. 

Assume that after Y, we have C and D. So, the order is ... Y, C, D. 

Let me try to write equations for the positions. 

First, for circle C: CD = 10. So, if C is at position c, then D is at c + 10. 

Also, D is on line ED, which extends from E(-5,0) through A(0,0), X(5,0), B, Y, C, D. 

Now, the problem states that AZ ≅ CW, and CW = 2. So, AZ = 2. 

Point Z is on line ED? Or elsewhere? 

Assuming Z is on line ED, since all other points are on ED. Let me assume that. 

So, AZ is the distance from A(0,0) to Z. If AZ = 2, then Z is either at (2,0) or (-2,0). But since A is at (0,0), and E is at (-5,0), X at (5,0), then Z could be at (2,0) or (-2,0). But need to check if these positions conflict with existing points. 

But since the problem says that AZ ≅ CW and CW = 2, so CW = 2. So, point W is such that the distance from C to W is 2. 

So, if we can find the position of C, then W is 2 units away from C on line ED. 

Now, the goal is to find YW. 

Let me try to find the positions step by step. 

First, let's fix the coordinates:

- E(-5,0), A(0,0), X(5,0).

For circle B: center at B, radius 15 (since diameter is 30). So, BY = 30. So, if B is at position b, then Y is at b + 30 or b - 30. Let's assume Y is to the right of B, so Y = b + 30. 

For circle C: center at C, radius 5 (diameter 10). So, CD = 10. If C is at position c, then D is at c + 10. 

Now, the line ED includes all these points: E(-5), A(0), X(5), B(b), Y(b+30), C(c), D(c+10). 

But we need to determine the positions of B, C, and D such that all these points are on the same line. 

Let me assume that after Y, we have C and D. So, the order is ..., Y, C, D. 

So, Y is at position b + 30, then C is next. Let's say the distance from Y to C is some value, and then from C to D is 10. 

But we need to find relationships between these. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express variables. Let me try to assign coordinates to B and C. 

Let me denote:

Position of B: b (on x-axis)

Position of Y: b + 30 (since BY = 30)

Position of C: c (on x-axis)

Position of D: c + 10 (since CD = 10)

Now, the line ED includes all these points. So, the sequence from E(-5) to D(c+10) would pass through A(0), X(5), B(b), Y(b+30), C(c), D(c+10). 

Now, we need to ensure that the points are in order. Let's assume that after X(5,0), we have B, then Y, then C, then D. 

So, assuming that b > 5 (since B is after X). Then Y is at b + 30, which would be much further to the right. Then, C is somewhere after Y, and D is 10 units to the right of C. 

But this might not hold unless we have specific values. 

Alternatively, maybe the positions are arranged such that D is after Y, but we need to link everything. 

Let me try to find the relationship between B, C, and D. 

But without more constraints, it's hard to determine exact positions. However, the key is to use the condition AZ = 2 and CW = 2. 

Let me focus on that. 

AZ is the distance from A(0,0) to Z. Since AZ = 2, and assuming Z is on line ED, then Z is at (2,0) or (-2,0). But since A is at (0,0), and E is at (-5,0), X at (5,0), Z could be at (2,0) or (-2,0). 

But if Z is at (2,0), then it's between A and X. If at (-2,0), it's between E and A. 

Now, the problem says that AZ ≅ CW, so CW = 2. So, point W is 2 units away from C on line ED. 

So, if C is at position c, then W is at c + 2 or c - 2. 

Our goal is to find YW, which is the distance between Y (at b + 30) and W (at c ± 2). 

To find YW, we need to find the difference between Y's position and W's position. 

But to find that, we need to know b and c. 

How can we find b and c? 

We need more constraints. Let's look back at the predicates. 

All points are on line ED. So, the entire sequence E(-5), A(0), X(5), B(b), Y(b+30), C(c), D(c+10) must be along the line ED. 

But there's no explicit information about the positions of B and C. However, there's the fact that point B is on circle B, which has diameter 30. So, the distance from B to Y is 30, which we've already used. 

But also, point B is on line ED, and point Y is also on line ED. 

Similarly, point C is on line ED, and point D is on line ED. 

Is there any other constraint? Let me think. 

What about the positions of other points? For example, point X is on circle A, which we've considered. 

But without more data, it's challenging. However, perhaps we can use the fact that all points are on line ED, and thus the positions are determined by the distances between them. 

Let me try to find the relation between b and c. 

Assume that after Y(b+30), we have C(c) and D(c+10). So, the distance from Y to C is c - (b + 30). 

But this is arbitrary unless we have more info. 

Alternatively, maybe the points are ordered as E, A, X, B, Y, C, D. So, after X(5), comes B, then Y, then C, then D. 

Let me assume that. 

So, after X(5,0), B is at some position b > 5. Then Y is at b + 30. Then C is at some position c > b + 30, and D is at c + 10. 

But how do we find b and c? 

Maybe there's a relation between B and C? Or between C and D? 

Wait, circle C has diameter CD = 10, so the length from C to D is 10. 

But what about other points? 

Alternatively, perhaps the position of B is related to the position of C through some other constraint. 

Alternatively, since all points are on line ED, which includes E(-5), A(0), X(5), B, Y, C, D. 

But without more info, it's hard to proceed. 

Wait, let's revisit the AZ = 2 condition. 

If Z is on line ED, then Z is either at (2,0) or (-2,0). Let's consider both cases. 

Case 1: Z is at (2,0). Then AZ = distance from A(0,0) to Z(2,0) is 2 units. 

Case 2: Z is at (-2,0). Then AZ = 2 units. 

But in either case, Z is on line ED. 

Now, the problem says that AZ ≅ CW, so CW = 2. So, point W is 2 units away from C on line ED. 

So, if C is at position c, then W is at c + 2 or c - 2. 

Now, to compute YW, we need to know the position of Y and W. 

Let me assume that Z is at (2,0). Then, since AZ = 2, this is consistent. 

But how does this relate to other parts? 

Alternatively, maybe Z is not on line ED. But the problem doesn't specify, so it's safer to assume it is. 

But without knowing where Z is, it's difficult. However, since the problem gives us that AZ = 2 and CW = 2, and we need to find YW, maybe we can find the relationship between Y and W via these conditions. 

Let me think differently. Since we're dealing with circles and points on a line, perhaps there's a way to use the lengths of the segments. 

Let me recall that for circle A, the radius is 5, and points E, A, X are on it. Earlier, we assumed that A is the center, which made sense. 

So, with A as the center, E is at (-5,0), X at (5,0). 

Now, for circle B, if the center is at B, then BY is the diameter, so BY = 30. So, if B is at position b on the x-axis, then Y is at b + 30 or b - 30. Assuming Y is to the right, Y = b + 30. 

For circle C, if the center is at C, then CD is the diameter, so CD = 10. So, if C is at position c, D is at c + 10. 

Now, the line ED includes all these points. So, after X(5,0), we have B at b, then Y at b + 30, then C at c, and D at c + 10. 

Now, we need to find b and c. 

But how? 

Let me think about the positions of B and C. Since B is on line ED, which includes all previous points. 

Assuming that after X(5), B is at some position greater than 5. Let's say B is at position b > 5. Then Y is at b + 30. 

Then, C is at some position c > b + 30, and D is at c + 10. 

But we need to relate b and c. 

Unless there's another constraint, like the fact that point C is on line ED and is part of circle C. 

Wait, point C is on circle C, which has center at C. So, point C is the center, so it's the center of circle C. 

But what about other points? For example, point D is on circle C, so CD = 10. 

But how does this help? 

Perhaps the position of C is related to other points. 

But without additional information, it's unclear. 

However, the key is that we need to find YW, which depends on the positions of Y and W. 

Let me consider that W is 2 units away from C. So, if C is at c, then W is at c ± 2. 

Now, Y is at b + 30. So, YW = |(b + 30) - (c ± 2)|. 

But to find this, we need to find the relationship between b and c. 

Is there a way to relate b and c? 

Let me think: the line ED includes all these points, including D. So, D is at c + 10. But where is D in relation to other points? 

Assuming that D is the last point on the line, after C. 

But without knowing where D is, it's hard to say. 

Wait, but perhaps there's a way to relate the positions using the fact that point D is on circle C, which has diameter CD = 10, and D is also on line ED. 

But I still don't see the connection. 

Let me try to make an assumption to proceed. Let's assume that after Y, we have C and D. So, the order is ..., Y, C, D. 

So, Y is at b + 30, C is at c, and D is at c + 10. 

Now, the distance from Y to C is c - (b + 30). 

But we need to find a relationship between b and c. 

Perhaps there's a missing constraint. Let me think about the other points. 

Point X is on circle A, which we've already considered. 

But what about other circles? For example, point B is on circle B, which has center at B. So, point B is the center, and Y is on the circle, so BY = 30. 

But how does this help? 

Maybe there's a way to relate the positions of B and C through other points. 

Alternatively, since all points are on line ED, which is a straight line, and we know some distances between points, perhaps we can express variables in terms of each other. 

For example, let's assume that after Y, we have C at position c, and D at c + 10. 

But without knowing where D is relative to other points, it's difficult. 

Wait, but the line ED extends from E(-5,0) through A(0,0), X(5,0), B, Y, C, D. So, D is the farthest point on the line. 

But how far is D from E? 

Well, if we can find the position of D, we can relate it to other points. 

But since D is on circle C, and CD = 10, and C is on line ED. 

Let me try to express everything in terms of b. 

Assume that after Y, we have C and D. So, Y is at b + 30, C is at c, D is at c + 10. 

But where is c in relation to b? 

It depends on the positioning. Let's assume that C is after Y, so c > b + 30. 

But without more info, we can't determine exact values. 

This suggests that there's missing information, but since it's a math problem, there must be a way. 

Wait, maybe the key is to realize that AZ = 2 and CW = 2, and use that to find YW. 

Let me think: if AZ = 2, and CW = 2, and we need YW. 

But how? 

Let me consider that Z is at (2,0), so AZ = 2. Then, CW = 2 means W is 2 units from C. 

But where is C? 

If I can express C's position in terms of other points, maybe I can find YW. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a property I missed. 

Let me recall that in the problem, the diameters are given. 

For circle A: diameter 10, so radius 5. 

For circle B: diameter 30, radius 15. 

For circle C: diameter 10, radius 5. 

Now, if I assume that the centers of the circles are at A, B, and C respectively, then:

- Circle A has center at A, radius 5. 
- Circle B has center at B, radius 15. 
- Circle C has center at C, radius 5. 

With this, points E and X are on circle A, so AE = AX = 5. 

Points B and Y are on circle B, so BY = 30. 

Points C and D are on circle C, so CD = 10. 

Now, let's try to find the positions of B and C. 

Let me assume that the line ED extends from E(-5,0) through A(0,0), X(5,0), then to B, Y, C, D. 

Let me define the positions:

- E: -5
- A: 0
- X: 5
- B: b
- Y: b + 30 (since BY = 30)
- C: c
- D: c + 10 (since CD = 10)

Now, the line ED includes all these points. 

But how to find b and c? 

Let me think about the position of D. Since D is on line ED, which extends to the right from E. 

But without additional constraints, it's still ambiguous. 

But perhaps there's a relation between B and C? For example, maybe the distance from B to C is something? 

No, not directly. 

But perhaps the fact that point C is on line ED, and D is 10 units away from C. 

Alternatively, maybe the position of D is related to other points. 

Wait, but the problem doesn't give any other constraints. So, perhaps there's an alternative approach. 

Let me consider that the length YW is to be found, and it's one of the options: 2, 3, 10, 30. 

Given that CW = 2, and AZ = 2. Maybe there's a way to relate YW to these. 

If I can express YW in terms of other lengths, perhaps using the positions. 

Let me try to think about the positions again. 

Assume that Z is at (2,0), so AZ
