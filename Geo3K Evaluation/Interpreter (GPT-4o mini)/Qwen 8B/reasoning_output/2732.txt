MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the side length of a square inscribed in a circle with a radius of 6 inches. The answer choices are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that when a square is inscribed in a circle, the diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle. That seems like a key point here. Let me think why that is. Because the vertices of the square touch the circumference of the circle, so the diagonal stretches from one corner of the square to the opposite corner, passing through the center of the circle. Therefore, the diagonal should be twice the radius, which is the diameter.

So if the radius is 6 inches, the diameter would be 12 inches. That means the diagonal of the square is 12 inches. Now, I need to relate the diagonal of the square to its side length. 

For a square, the relationship between the side length (let's call it 's') and the diagonal (d) is given by the Pythagorean theorem. Since the diagonal splits the square into two right-angled triangles, each with legs of length 's' and hypotenuse 'd'. So, according to the Pythagorean theorem, d² = s² + s², which simplifies to d² = 2s². Taking the square root of both sides gives d = s√2. 

So rearranging that formula to solve for 's', we get s = d / √2. Substituting the diameter we found earlier, which is 12 inches, into this equation gives s = 12 / √2. However, rationalizing the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by √2: (12√2) / (√2 * √2) = (12√2)/2 = 6√2. 

Wait, but looking at the answer choices, there's an option C which is 6√2. But let me double-check my steps. Did I make a mistake?

Let me recap. The radius is 6, so diameter is 12. Diagonal of square equals diameter. Then, diagonal = s√2. Solving for s gives s = diagonal / √2 = 12 / √2 = 6√2. Yes, that's correct. So the side length is 6√2. 

But wait, looking back at the answer options, option C is 6√2. So that should be the answer. But let me check again if there's another way this could be approached. Maybe using coordinates? Suppose the square is centered at the origin with vertices on the circle. For example, if the square has vertices at (a, a), (-a, a), (-a, -a), (a, -a). Then the distance from the origin to any vertex is sqrt(a² + a²) = a√2. This should equal the radius, which is 6. Wait, no—the radius is 6, so the distance from the center to a vertex is the radius. Therefore, a√2 = 6, so a = 6 / √2. Then the side length of the square would be the distance between (a,a) and (-a,a), which is 2a. Wait, no—wait, the distance between (a,a) and (-a,a) is 2a, but that's actually the horizontal side. Wait, no—if the square is rotated so that its corners are on the circle, then the side length would be different. Wait, maybe I confused something here.

Alternatively, perhaps considering the square inscribed in the circle, so the diagonal is the diameter. So regardless of how the square is oriented, the diagonal must be equal to the diameter. So even if I use coordinates, the diagonal would still be 2r. So yes, the previous calculation holds. Thus, the side length is 6√2. 

Looking at the answer choices again: option C is 6√2. So that's the answer. But let me check the options again to make sure. The options are:

A. 3/sqrt(2)

B. 3√2

C. 6√2

D. 12√2

Yes, so option C. But wait, sometimes people might confuse whether the radius or diameter is used. Let me confirm once more. The radius is 6, so diameter is 12. Diagonal is 12. So s√2 = 12 → s=12/√2 = 6√2. Correct. So answer is C. 

Another way to think: area of square is s². But that's not directly helpful here. Alternatively, if someone thought the radius was the same as half the diagonal, but that's not the case. The radius is half the diagonal. So if the radius is 6, the diagonal is 12. So yeah, the answer is 6√2. So the correct choice is C.
