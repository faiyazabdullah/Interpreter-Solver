MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So we have a rectangle DEFG. First, I need to recall some properties of rectangles. In a rectangle, all angles are right angles, so each angle should be 90 degrees. But wait, the problem gives us expressions for two angles: m∠EFD = 2x - 3 and m∠DFG = x + 12. Hmm, but how do these angles relate?

Let me visualize the rectangle. Let me label the rectangle D-E-F-G. Wait, rectangles are quadrilaterals with four sides, so maybe the order is D connected to E, E to F, F to G, and G back to D? So the vertices are D, E, F, G in order. So the sides would be DE, EF, FG, GD.

Now, looking at angle EFD. That's angle at point F, between points E, F, D. Wait, so angle EFD is formed by points E, F, D. Since it's a rectangle, the sides EF and FD are adjacent sides meeting at point F. But in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular, so angle EFD should be 90 degrees. But according to the problem, m∠EFD is 2x - 3. Wait, that suggests that 2x - 3 equals 90? But then solving for x would give x = (90 + 3)/2 = 93/2 = 46.5. Then m∠DFG is x + 12, which would be 46.5 + 12 = 58.5 degrees. But that doesn't make sense because in a rectangle, all angles are 90 degrees. So there must be something wrong here.

Wait, maybe I misread the angles. Let me check again. The angles mentioned are ∠EFD and ∠DFG. Maybe they're not the internal angles of the rectangle? Or perhaps they are angles formed by diagonals or something else?

Wait, in a rectangle, the diagonals bisect each other and are equal in length. But if we consider diagonal DG, connecting D to G. Wait, but maybe ∠DFG is referring to an angle involving the diagonal? Let me think. Let's try to sketch mentally the rectangle D-E-F-G. Points D, E, F, G. So DE is one side, EF is another, FG is the next, and GD closes the shape.

So point F is connected to E and G. So angle EFD is at point F, between E, F, D. Wait, but point D is connected to F? Wait, no. In the rectangle, the sides are DE, EF, FG, GD. So point D is connected to E and G. Point F is connected to E and G. Wait, so DF would be a diagonal? Because D is connected to E and G, and F is connected to E and G. So DF connects D to F, which is a diagonal of the rectangle. Similarly, FG is a side from F to G.

Therefore, angle EFD is the angle at F between E, F, D. So that would be the angle between FE and FD. Since FE is a side of the rectangle (from F to E), and FD is the diagonal from F to D. Therefore, angle EFD is part of triangle EFD, which is a triangle formed by points E, F, D. Similarly, angle DFG is the angle at F between D, F, G. So that would be between FD and FG. 

Since FG is a side of the rectangle (from F to G) and FD is the diagonal from F to D. So angle DFG is also part of triangle DFG. Now, since the figure is a rectangle, certain properties hold. For example, the diagonals of a rectangle are equal and bisect each other. Also, in triangle EFD, since ED is a side of the rectangle and FD is a diagonal, maybe we can use some trigonometry or properties of triangles here. However, maybe there's a simpler way.

But wait, since we have two angles given, maybe they are supplementary or complementary? Let me think about the sum of those angles. At point F, the total around that point is 360 degrees. But within the rectangle, the angles at each corner are 90 degrees. However, angles EFD and DFG are not necessarily adjacent. Wait, let me see. At point F, the original rectangle has a 90-degree angle between EF and FG. But angle EFD and angle DFG are parts of that 90-degree angle? Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Point F is connected to E and G. So the original angle at vertex F in the rectangle is between EF and FG, which is 90 degrees. However, angle EFD is between FE and FD (since FD is the diagonal). And angle DFG is between FD and FG. Therefore, angles EFD and DFG together form the original 90-degree angle at F. So angle EFD + angle DFG = 90 degrees. Because FD splits the original 90-degree angle into two smaller angles: EFD and DFG. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

(2x - 3) + (x + 12) = 90.

Solving this equation:

Combine like terms: 2x - 3 + x + 12 = 90 → 3x + 9 = 90 → 3x = 81 → x = 27.

Then substitute x back into m∠EFD = 2x - 3 → 2*27 - 3 = 54 - 3 = 51 degrees. Which is option A. But let me verify.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the sum is 90 degrees. Let me confirm. Since FD is a diagonal of the rectangle, splitting the angle at F. The original angle at F in the rectangle is 90 degrees, and FD divides that angle into two angles: EFD and DFG. Hence, yes, their measures add up to 90 degrees. So the equation is correct.

Thus, solving gives x=27, leading to m∠EFD being 51 degrees. So answer A is 51, which is option A. Let me check the options given: A. 51, B. 55, C. 67, D. 102. So the answer should be A. But wait, just to ensure, maybe there's another approach.

Another way: suppose we consider coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to the rectangle. Let’s say point D is at (0,0), E is at (a,0), F is at (a,b), G is at (0,b). So DE is horizontal from (0,0) to (a,0); EF is vertical from (a,0) to (a,b); FG is horizontal from (a,b) to (0,b)? Wait, no. From F(a,b) to G would be leftward to (0,b)? Wait, no. Wait, if it's a rectangle, the order of the letters matters. If it's D-E-F-G-D, then moving from D to E to F to G to D. So if D is (0,0), E is (a,0), then F would be (a,b), and G would be (0,b). So FG is from F(a,b) to G(0,b). So FG is horizontal leftwards. Then, angle DFG is at point F(a,b), between D, F, G. So FD is from F(a,b) to D(0,0), and FG is from F(a,b) to G(0,b). So angle between FD and FG at point F. 

Similarly, angle EFD is at F(a,b) between E(a,0), F(a,b), D(0,0). So vectors FE and FD. Vector FE goes from F to E: (a- a, 0 - b) = (0, -b). Vector FD goes from F to D: (0 - a, 0 - b) = (-a, -b). So angle between FE (which is straight down along y-axis) and FD (which is diagonal to D). Similarly, angle DFG is between FD (same vector as above) and FG, which is from F(a,b) to G(0,b): (-a, 0). So vector FG is (-a, 0).

So angle EFD is the angle between FE (downward y-axis) and FD (diagonal to D). Angle DFG is between FD (diagonal) and FG (leftward x-axis). These two angles add up to the angle between FE and FG, which is 90 degrees. Hence, confirming the previous conclusion.

So the equations are correct. Thus, solving gives x=27, leading to 2x-3=51. So answer A. So the correct answer is A.
