MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. The question says "Find the measure of ∠3 if AB ⊥ BC." Hmm, but wait, there's no diagram provided. That's tricky because without seeing the figure, it's hard to know where points A, B, C are located and how ∠3 is formed. But maybe there's some standard configuration here?

First, let me parse the given information. We have AB perpendicular to BC. So, AB ⊥ BC means that the lines AB and BC form a right angle at point B. So, point B is the vertex of the right angle. Therefore, triangle ABC would be a right-angled triangle at B. Wait, but the question mentions ∠3. Usually, angles in diagrams are labeled with numbers, so ∠3 could refer to one of the other angles in the triangle. Let me think.

In a right-angled triangle, the sum of the acute angles is 90 degrees. If ∠3 is one of those acute angles, we need more information. However, the problem doesn't provide any other measures or relations. Wait, maybe there's missing information? Or perhaps there's an accompanying diagram that isn't shown here? Since the user mentioned they can't identify people or objects in images, maybe the original problem had a diagram with labels, but it's not included here.

Alternatively, maybe ∠3 refers to an angle outside the triangle? For example, if there are intersecting lines or something else. Without the diagram, it's challenging. Wait, but maybe the problem is part of a standard setup. Let me consider common scenarios where AB ⊥ BC and an angle labeled 3 comes into play.

Another thought: Maybe ∠3 is an exterior angle or part of another triangle. Suppose AB and BC are two sides forming a right angle, and ∠3 is an angle adjacent to them or part of another structure. But again, without knowing the exact configuration, it's difficult. 

Wait, maybe the problem is referring to a transversal or parallel lines? For instance, if there are parallel lines cut by a transversal, creating corresponding angles. But the given info is just AB ⊥ BC. Alternatively, maybe ∠3 is formed by extending lines or something like that.

Hold on, perhaps the original problem had more details, like other angles or lines. Since the answer choices are numerical (64, 68, 72, 76), maybe the problem involves supplementary angles or complementary angles. For example, if ∠3 is adjacent to the right angle, then its measure would depend on other angles. But without more data, this is too vague.

Wait, maybe there was an image where AB and BC are parts of a larger figure, such as a polygon with several angles, and ∠3 is one of them. If AB is perpendicular to BC, then angle at B is 90°, but other angles might relate to ∠3 via triangle properties or other theorems. For example, if there's a triangle involving ∠3 and the right angle.

But since I don't have the diagram, I need to make assumptions. Let me try assuming that ∠3 is one of the non-right angles in triangle ABC. Then, if AB ⊥ BC, making ∠B = 90°, then the sum of ∠A and ∠C is 90°. But without knowing either ∠A or ∠C, I can't find ∠3. Unless there's more info, like side lengths or other angles.

Wait, but the answer options are all around 60-76, so maybe there's a specific ratio or property. Another possibility: if there's a triangle where AB is perpendicular to BC, and ∠3 is an external angle. For example, if there's a line extending from C or A, creating an angle with AB or BC. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves vertical angles or alternate interior angles. For instance, if AB is perpendicular to BC, and another line creates ∠3 with some relation. But again, without the diagram, this is guesswork.

Wait, maybe the problem is referencing a standard configuration. Like, suppose AB and BC are legs of a right triangle, and ∠3 is an angle formed by a median or altitude. But again, without specifics, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a transversal involved. For example, if AB and BC are two lines intersecting at B, and a third line forms ∠3 with one of them. But unless there's more info, this is speculative.

Hmm, this seems impossible without the diagram. However, maybe the original problem had a standard setup where AB ⊥ BC and ∠3 is a specific angle in a certain configuration. Given that answer choices are numerical, maybe there's an implied relationship. For example, if ∠3 is half of some angle or relates via a triangle's angles.

Wait, maybe the problem is from a textbook or a common problem type. Let me think about typical problems where AB ⊥ BC and an angle is asked. One common scenario is a right triangle with an angle bisector, or maybe involving exterior angles. 

For instance, if AB is perpendicular to BC, and there's a line from B making an angle ∠3 with AB or BC. But again, without knowing where ∠3 is, it's unclear. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves a square or rectangle with diagonals, where ∠3 is formed by the diagonal. For example, in a square, the diagonal splits the right angle into 45°, but that's not matching the answer choices.

Wait, another idea: if AB ⊥ BC, then maybe triangle ABC is part of a larger figure with other lines, and ∠3 is formed by intersecting lines. For example, if there's a line from A to C, and another line creating ∠3. But again, without the diagram, I can't proceed accurately.

Given that the answer choices are A. 64, B. 68, C. 72, D. 76, and the problem gives AB ⊥ BC, which implies a right angle at B. Perhaps the problem is part of a set where other angles are given indirectly. For example, maybe there's an isosceles triangle or something else.

Wait, if I assume that ∠3 is an angle in triangle ABC, then since it's a right triangle, the sum of the other two angles is 90°. If there's a way to express one angle in terms of another... but without more data, this is impossible.

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves supplementary angles. For example, if ∠3 is supplementary to the right angle, making it 90°, but that's not among the choices.

Wait, perhaps there's an error in the problem statement? Or maybe I missed something. The user mentioned they can't identify people or objects in images, implying that the original problem has a diagram, which is essential for understanding where ∠3 is located.

Since I can't see the diagram, I need to make an educated guess. Let me try considering that ∠3 is an angle formed by extending BC beyond C, creating an angle with another line. For example, if there's a line CD such that ∠3 is formed between BC and CD, and AB is perpendicular to BC. But without knowing CD's relation to AB or other elements, this is too vague.

Alternatively, maybe ∠3 is an angle in a different triangle connected to ABC. For instance, if there's a triangle sharing a side with ABC, leading to some angle relations. But again, no way to tell.

Wait, maybe the problem refers to a specific theorem or formula. For example, if AB ⊥ BC, then using slopes or coordinate geometry. Let me try assigning coordinates. Let’s place point B at the origin (0,0). Since AB is perpendicular to BC, let’s say AB is along the y-axis and BC is along the x-axis. So, point A could be (0, a) and point C could be (c, 0). Now, ∠3—where is it? If ∠3 is at point A, then it would be an angle between BA and AC. Similarly, if it's at point C, it's between CB and CA. But without knowing which angle it is, I can’t compute it. 

Alternatively, if ∠3 is formed by some other intersection. For example, if there's a line from A to C, forming a triangle, and ∠3 is at point C. In that case, using the right triangle, we can use trigonometry. But again, without knowing side lengths or other angles, we can’t calculate the measure. 

This suggests that the problem requires more information than what's provided. However, since the user expects an answer, maybe there's a standard assumption. For example, if the problem is from a specific source where ∠3 refers to a particular angle in a standard configuration. 

Wait, maybe the problem involves a transversal cutting across AB and BC, creating ∠3. For example, if a line crosses AB and BC, forming corresponding or alternate angles. But again, without specifics, this is guesswork.

Another thought: Maybe ∠3 is an angle in a different triangle where AB and BC are sides. For example, if there's a triangle where AB and BC are sides, and ∠3 is opposite one of them. But again, without knowing the type of triangle or other angles, it's impossible to determine.

At this point, I realize that without the diagram, it's impossible to accurately solve the problem. However, since the user has provided answer choices, maybe I should look for patterns. The answer options are close to each other, suggesting that the problem might involve subtracting from 90° or adding up to 90°, but none of the choices are directly 90°. 

Wait, maybe ∠3 is an exterior angle. For example, in a right triangle, an exterior angle would be equal to the sum of the remote interior angles. If one of the acute angles is, say, 64°, then the exterior angle would be 90 + 64 = 154°, which isn't among the options. Alternatively, if ∠3 is an angle formed by extending one of the sides. 

Alternatively, if there's a triangle with AB ⊥ BC, and ∠3 is an angle formed by a median or something. For example, in a right triangle, the median to the hypotenuse is half the hypotenuse, but that doesn't directly give an angle measure.

Wait, maybe there's an error in the problem, and the actual intention was to provide more information. But given the current state, I can't proceed further. Since I need to choose an answer, and the options are A-D, maybe I should consider that the right angle is 90°, and the other angles add up to 90°, so if ∠3 is one of them, perhaps it's a commonly used angle like 60°, but none of the choices are 60°. Alternatively, if it's part of a different triangle.

Wait, another angle: maybe ∠3 is an angle in a different configuration, like a cyclic quadrilateral. If AB ⊥ BC, and the quadrilateral includes ∠3, but again, without the diagram, this is uncertain.

Given all these uncertainties, I might have to conclude that the problem cannot be solved without the diagram. However, since the user expects an answer, and given that the answer options are numerical, perhaps there's an assumed standard configuration. 

Let me make an assumption: Assume that ∠3 is an angle in a triangle where AB ⊥ BC, making it a right triangle at B. Suppose that there's another line, say BD, which is an angle bisector or something, splitting the right angle into two angles. For example, if BD bisects the right angle, then each angle is 45°, but that's not in the options. 

Alternatively, if there's an isosceles right triangle, where the legs are equal, making the angles 45°, but again not matching the choices. 

Alternatively, if there's a triangle where AB ⊥ BC, and ∠3 is an angle outside the triangle. For example, if there's a line extending from C, forming an angle with BC, and AB is perpendicular to BC. But without knowing the direction of that extension, it's impossible.

Wait, maybe the problem involves a triangle with AB ⊥ BC, and ∠3 is the angle between AB and another line. For example, if there's a line from A to some point D, forming ∠3 with AB. But again, no data.

At this point, I'm stuck. Without the diagram, I can't determine where ∠3 is located. However, since the answer options are numerical and the problem involves a right angle, maybe the intended answer is 68°, which is one of the choices. But this is purely a guess. Alternatively, if the right angle is split into angles that add up to 90°, and ∠3 is one of them. For example, if the other angle is 22°, then ∠3 would be 68°, which is option B. This is a shot in the dark, but given the lack of information, I'll go with option B as a possible answer.
