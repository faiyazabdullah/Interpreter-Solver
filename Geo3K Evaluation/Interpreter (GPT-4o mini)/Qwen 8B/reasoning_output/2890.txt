<think>
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have several points mentioned: P, Q, R, S, T. There are triangles mentioned: Triangle(P, Q, R) and Triangle(T, S, R). Then there are lines: Line(P, Q), Line(R, P), Line(R, S), and Line(R, T). Also, some length equalities and parallelism conditions. 

Let me try to visualize this. Maybe drawing a diagram would help, but since I can't draw, I'll imagine it. So first, Line(P, Q) means points P and Q are connected by a straight line. Similarly, Line(R, P) connects R and P, and Line(R, S) connects R and S. Also, there's a line RT, which is part of the triangle T, S, R. Wait, Triangle(T, S, R) implies that T, S, R form a triangle. 

Now, the lengths: Length of RS is 10 units. Length of SQ is 5 units. Length of PQ is 25 units. And we need to find the length of RT, which is denoted as x. Also, there are two parallel lines: Line(PQ) is parallel to Line(RS), and Line(TP) is parallel to Line(SQ). 

So, first, let me note down all the given data:

- Lines:
   - PQ (from P to Q)
   - RP (from R to P)
   - RS (from R to S)
   - RT (from R to T)

Triangles:
   - Triangle PQR (since Triangle(P,Q,R))
   - Triangle TSR (Triangle(T,S,R))

Lengths:
   - RS = 10
   - SQ = 5
   - PQ = 25
   - Need to find RT = x

Parallel lines:
   - PQ || RS
   - TP || SQ

Hmm. Since PQ is parallel to RS, maybe there's a parallelogram or similar triangles involved here. Also, TP is parallel to SQ. Let me think about the implications of these parallel lines.

First, considering PQ || RS. Since PQ and RS are parallel, perhaps the triangles formed by these lines could be similar? Also, since there's a triangle PQR and another triangle TSR, maybe there's some similarity or proportionality.

Wait, let me consider coordinates. Sometimes assigning coordinates helps. Let me try coordinate geometry. Let me assign coordinates to points to make calculations easier.

Let me assume point R is at the origin (0, 0) because there are lines from R to P, R to S, and R to T. That might simplify things. 

Since RS is 10 units long and PQ is parallel to RS. Let me suppose RS is along the x-axis for simplicity. So if R is at (0, 0), then S could be at (10, 0), since RS has length 10. Now, PQ is parallel to RS, so PQ should also be horizontal if RS is horizontal. 

But where is point P? Well, there's a line RP connecting R(0,0) to P. Also, there's a line PQ connecting P to Q. Let me think. Let me denote coordinates:

Let me set R at (0, 0). Then S is at (10, 0) since RS = 10. Now, PQ is parallel to RS, which is horizontal. Therefore, PQ must also be horizontal. Let me find coordinates for P and Q. 

Also, PQ has length 25. Let me assume that PQ is horizontal. Suppose P is somewhere, and Q is to the right of P. But since there's a line from R to P, which is connected to R(0,0). So point P lies somewhere such that line RP connects R(0,0) to P. Let me assign coordinates to P. Let me call P as (a, b). Then line RP goes from (0,0) to (a,b). Then line PQ goes from P(a,b) to Q. Since PQ is horizontal, Q must be at (a + 25, b) because PQ has length 25. Wait, but direction matters. Wait, the vector from P to Q should be horizontal. So if PQ is horizontal, then the y-coordinate of Q equals that of P. So if P is (a, b), then Q is (a + d, b), where d is the length of PQ, which is 25. So Q is (a + 25, b).

Additionally, there's a line from Q to S. Because Line(S, Q) exists. Wait, the given has Equals(LengthOf(Line(S, Q)), 5). So SQ is 5 units. So the distance between S(10,0) and Q(a+25, b) is 5. Let me write that equation.

Distance between S(10, 0) and Q(a + 25, b):

√[(a + 25 - 10)^2 + (b - 0)^2] = √[(a + 15)^2 + b²] = 5.

So (a + 15)^2 + b² = 25. Equation (1).

Also, there's another condition: Line(TP) is parallel to Line(SQ). Let me see. Line(SQ) goes from S(10,0) to Q(a + 25, b). The slope of SQ is [b - 0]/[a + 25 - 10] = b/(a + 15). 

Line(TP) goes from T to P(a, b). Wait, but we don't know where T is yet. However, Triangle(T, S, R) exists, so T is connected to S and R. Also, there's Line(R, T), so T is connected to R(0,0). 

Moreover, since Line(TP) is parallel to Line(SQ), their slopes must be equal. So slope of TP equals slope of SQ.

Let me denote T as (c, d). Then line TP connects T(c,d) to P(a, b). The slope of TP is (b - d)/(a - c). This must equal the slope of SQ, which is b/(a + 15). So:

(b - d)/(a - c) = b/(a + 15) → cross-multiplying gives (b - d)(a + 15) = b(a - c). 

But I don't know c and d yet. However, since T is part of Triangle(T, S, R), so points T, S, R form a triangle. Also, R is (0,0), S is (10,0). So T is some point forming triangle with those. Additionally, there's Line(R, T), which is from R(0,0) to T(c,d). 

But maybe there's more constraints. Also, we need to find RT, which is the length from R(0,0) to T(c,d), which is sqrt(c² + d²) = x. So our goal is to find x.

But how do we connect all these variables?

Wait, perhaps we can use similar triangles or vector approaches. Let me think again about the parallel lines.

Given that PQ || RS, and TP || SQ. Let me check if there are similar triangles here. For instance, since PQ || RS, maybe triangle PRQ is similar to something?

Alternatively, since TP || SQ, and PQ || RS, perhaps there's a parallelogram or some proportional segments.

Alternatively, since TP || SQ, which is a line segment from S to Q. Let me consider vectors. The vector SQ is Q - S = [(a + 25) - 10, b - 0] = (a + 15, b). The vector TP is P - T = (a - c, b - d). Since TP is parallel to SQ, they must be scalar multiples. So TP = k * SQ for some scalar k. Thus,

a - c = k*(a + 15)
b - d = k*b

Therefore, we can express c and d in terms of a, b, and k:

c = a - k*(a + 15)
d = b - k*b = b(1 - k)

But T is a point connected to R(0,0) via line RT, so T lies somewhere. Also, since T is part of triangle TSR, which includes points T, S(10,0), and R(0,0). So T is connected to R and S. Also, we need to find RT's length.

But perhaps we can find relations between these variables. Let me think. Also, we have the earlier equation from SQ's length: (a + 15)^2 + b^2 = 25. Let me keep that in mind.

Another thing: The triangle PQR. Since Triangle(P, Q, R) exists. So points P, Q, R form a triangle. We already have coordinates for P(a,b), Q(a + 25, b), R(0,0). So let me compute the sides of triangle PQR. 

PR is from P(a,b) to R(0,0): length sqrt(a² + b²)
QR is from Q(a + 25, b) to R(0,0): sqrt((a + 25)^2 + b²)
PQ is 25, as given.

But maybe that's not directly helpful unless we get more info. Alternatively, maybe there's another relation from the triangle TSR. Points T, S(10,0), R(0,0). So TS is from T(c,d) to S(10,0), TR is from T(c,d) to R(0,0), and SR is from S(10,0) to R(0,0). 

But without knowing T's coordinates, it's hard to proceed. However, since we have the relationship between TP and SQ, and the coordinates expressions for c and d in terms of a, b, and k, maybe we can find more equations.

Wait, but we might need another equation. Perhaps involving the fact that T is connected to S? Or maybe another parallel line?

Wait, the line TP is parallel to SQ. So the vector TP is parallel to SQ, which we already used. Also, since TP is part of triangle TSR, which is Triangle(T, S, R). So perhaps triangle TSR has some properties?

Alternatively, since we have two parallel lines, maybe there's a transversal creating similar triangles. For example, if PQ || RS, and there's a transversal cutting them, creating similar triangles. 

Alternatively, since PQ || RS, and TP || SQ, which is a different pair of lines. Maybe there's a way to set up proportions.

Alternatively, since TP || SQ, then the ratio of TP to SQ is equal to some scaling factor. Let me think about vectors again. If TP is parallel to SQ, then TP = k * SQ. As before.

Earlier, we had:

TP = k * SQ → (a - c, b - d) = k*(a + 15, b)

Which gives:

a - c = k(a + 15) → c = a - k(a + 15)
and 
b - d = k*b → d = b - k*b = b(1 - k)

Now, since T is connected to R(0,0), so line RT connects R(0,0) to T(c, d). So the coordinates of T are (c, d) = (a - k(a + 15), b(1 - k)).

But we need another equation to relate these variables. Perhaps using the fact that T is part of triangle TSR, which may imply certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe there's another relation involving the position of T.

Alternatively, since we have triangle TSR, and we might need to use some other properties. But I'm stuck here. Let me think differently.

Let me recall that in such problems, sometimes the concept of similar triangles comes into play. Given that there are pairs of parallel lines, which often indicate similar triangles.

Since PQ || RS, and TP || SQ, maybe there are similar triangles here. Let me consider the lines and their intersections.

For example, if we look at the lines PQ and RS being parallel, and the lines TP and SQ being parallel. Maybe there's a parallelogram formed by these lines?

Alternatively, consider the intersection of lines. For instance, since PQ is parallel to RS, and TP is parallel to SQ, perhaps the lines TP and RS intersect at some point, creating similar triangles?

Alternatively, since TP || SQ, and PQ || RS, perhaps the figure forms a trapezoid or something similar.

Wait, let me try to find ratios. Since PQ is parallel to RS, the ratio of lengths might be related. For example, if we can find the ratio of PQ to RS, which is 25/10 = 5/2. 

But how does this relate to other parts?

Alternatively, since TP is parallel to SQ, which is length 5. Maybe there's a proportion between TP and SQ?

Alternatively, considering the triangles formed by these lines. Let me think about triangle SPR and something else. Hmm.

Wait, let's go back to the coordinate system approach. Earlier, we had:

From SQ's length: (a + 15)^2 + b^2 = 25. Equation (1)

And we have expressions for c and d in terms of a, b, and k. Also, since T is connected to R(0,0), and we need to find RT's length, which is sqrt(c² + d²) = x. So x² = c² + d².

Substituting c and d:

c = a - k(a + 15)
d = b(1 - k)

Thus,

x² = [a - k(a + 15)]² + [b(1 - k)]²

Expanding:

= [a² - 2ak(a + 15) + k²(a + 15)^2] + [b²(1 - 2k + k²)]

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's another relation involving k?

Perhaps from the triangle TSR. Since T, S, R form a triangle, but without more info, it's unclear. Wait, but maybe there's another condition from the fact that TP is parallel to SQ. Is there anything else?

Wait, since TP || SQ, and we have the coordinates of T expressed in terms of a, b, and k, maybe there's a relation from the triangle PQR or something else?

Alternatively, maybe there's a relation between the coordinates of T and other points. For example, since T is connected to S(10,0) and R(0,0), perhaps the line TS has some property. But I don't see it yet.

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that PQ || RS and TP || SQ to find ratios. Let me think in terms of vectors or parametric equations.

Let me consider the vector approach. Since PQ is parallel to RS, and TP is parallel to SQ. Let me denote vectors:

Vector PQ = Q - P = (25, 0) since PQ is horizontal and length 25. Wait, if PQ is horizontal, then its direction is purely horizontal. But earlier, I assumed PQ is horizontal because RS is horizontal. However, if PQ is horizontal, then the vector PQ is (25, 0). Vector RS is S - R = (10, 0) - (0, 0) = (10, 0). So PQ is a scalar multiple of RS (since PQ is 25 units and RS is 10 units, so PQ = (25/10)*RS). 

Similarly, vector SQ is Q - S. Earlier, Q was at (a + 25, b), S is at (10, 0). So vector SQ = (a + 25 - 10, b - 0) = (a + 15, b). Which we had earlier. And vector TP is P - T. Since TP || SQ, then TP = λ * SQ for some scalar λ. So:

P - T = λ * SQ → T = P - λ * SQ.

So T = P - λ * SQ.

Let me write that:

T_x = P_x - λ * SQ_x = a - λ*(a + 15)
T_y = P_y - λ * SQ_y = b - λ*b = b(1 - λ)

So same as before. Now, since T lies on line RT, which connects R(0,0) to T. So the coordinates of T can also be represented as a scalar multiple along the line from R to T. Wait, but T is just a point; the line RT is from R(0,0) to T. So T is arbitrary except for being connected to R and S.

But how can we find λ? Maybe using the fact that T is part of triangle TSR. Wait, triangle TSR has vertices T, S(10,0), and R(0,0). So T is connected to S and R. So line TS connects T to S(10,0). But I still don't see a direct relation.

Wait, but maybe there's another condition involving the triangle TSR. For example, the length of RT is x, which is what we need to find. Also, the coordinates of T are expressed in terms of a, b, and λ. Maybe we can find another equation involving a, b, and λ?

Earlier, we had the equation from SQ's length: (a + 15)^2 + b^2 = 25. Let me expand that:

(a + 15)^2 + b^2 = a² + 30a + 225 + b² = 25 → a² + b² + 30a + 225 = 25 → a² + b² + 30a = -200. Hmm, that seems odd. Wait, but since a² + b² represents the square of the distance from R(0,0) to P(a,b), which is PR. But PR is a real length, so a² + b² ≥ 0. However, according to this equation, a² + b² = -30a - 200. So for this to hold, -30a - 200 ≥ 0 → -30a ≥ 200 → a ≤ -200/30 ≈ -6.666...

So that tells us that a is negative. Interesting. Let me note that.

But how does this help us? Let me think. Also, since T is defined as T = P - λ*SQ, and we want to find RT, which is the distance from R(0,0) to T. So RT² = T_x² + T_y² = [a - λ(a + 15)]² + [b(1 - λ)]². Expanding this:

= a² - 2λa(a + 15) + λ²(a + 15)^2 + b²(1 - 2λ + λ²)

Combine terms:

= a² + b² - 2λa(a + 15) - 2λb² + λ²[(a + 15)^2 + b²]

But from earlier, (a + 15)^2 + b² = 25. So substitute that:

= a² + b² - 2λ[a(a + 15) + b²] + λ² * 25

But from the previous equation, a² + b² = -30a - 200. So substituting that:

= (-30a - 200) - 2λ[a(a + 15) + b²] + 25λ²

Now, we need to evaluate a(a + 15) + b². Let's compute that:

a(a + 15) + b² = a² + 15a + b² = (a² + b²) + 15a = (-30a - 200) + 15a = -15a - 200.

So substituting back:

RT² = (-30a - 200) - 2λ(-15a - 200) + 25λ²

= -30a - 200 + 30aλ + 400λ + 25λ²

This expression seems complex. How can we find λ? Maybe there's another condition involving λ?

Wait, since T lies on line RT, which is from R(0,0) to T. But we've already used that to define T. Perhaps there's another condition involving triangle TSR? For example, maybe the line ST has some relation?

Alternatively, since T is part of triangle TSR, which is a triangle, but without more info, it's difficult. Wait, maybe there's a relation between the coordinates of T and S?

Alternatively, maybe there's a relation between the slopes of lines involved. For example, since TP || SQ, and we've already used that. Or maybe considering other parallel lines?

Wait, maybe there's a way to find λ by using the fact that T lies on line RT, but I'm not sure. Wait, T is on line RT by definition. So maybe that doesn't give new info.

Alternatively, since there's a triangle TSR, maybe we can find another relation involving λ. For example, the coordinates of T must satisfy some condition with respect to S(10,0) and R(0,0). 

Wait, the line TS connects T to S(10,0). But without more info, I can't see how that helps. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a relation from the triangle PQR. Let me think. In triangle PQR, we have points P(a,b), Q(a+25, b), R(0,0). Maybe we can find some relation between these points. For example, the area or something else. But I don't see it yet.

Wait, but earlier we found that a² + b² = -30a - 200. Let me rearrange that equation:

a² + b² + 30a = -200

Complete the square for a:

a² + 30a + ... = -200 - b²

a² + 30a + 225 = -200 - b² + 225

(a + 15)^2 = 25 - b²

Wait, this is interesting! From the equation (a + 15)^2 + b² = 25, which is the same as above. So that's consistent. So this shows that the earlier equation is consistent with itself. Not helpful for finding a or b.

Hmm. So this suggests that there are infinitely many solutions depending on a and b, but with the constraint that (a + 15)^2 + b² = 25. So a and b lie on a circle centered at (-15, 0) with radius 5. But how does this help?

Maybe I need to find another equation involving a and b. Let me think. Are there any other given lengths or conditions?

Wait, we have the length of PQ as 25, which we already considered. Also, the line RT's length is x, which depends on λ and a, b. But without more info, it's challenging.

Wait, perhaps there's a relation between the triangles. Since TP || SQ, and PQ || RS, maybe the triangles are similar?

For example, consider triangles TPQ and SRS? No, not sure. Or maybe triangles formed by the parallels.

Alternatively, since PQ || RS and TP || SQ, the figure might be a parallelogram or something similar. Let me think about the vectors.

Vector PQ is parallel to RS, and vector TP is parallel to SQ. So maybe there's a translation or scaling involved.

Wait, if I consider the entire configuration, since PQ || RS and TP || SQ, then the lines PQ and RS are parallel, and TP and SQ are parallel. This suggests that the figure might involve a translation or shear transformation.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio between the lengths of PQ and RS is equal to the ratio between TP and SQ? Since they're corresponding sides in similar figures.

Wait, PQ is 25, RS is 10, so ratio is 25/10 = 5/2. If TP corresponds to SQ, then TP/SQ = 5/2? But SQ is 5, so TP would be (5/2)*5 = 12.5? But that's assuming similarity, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, but TP is parallel to SQ, but they are not necessarily corresponding sides of similar triangles. However, if there's a transversal or something, maybe.

Alternatively, since TP || SQ, and PQ || RS, then the quadrilateral formed by these lines might be a parallelogram. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the slopes. The slope of PQ is 0 (horizontal), and slope of RS is 0. Slope of SQ is b/(a + 15), and slope of TP is the same. So if we can find the relation between these slopes.

But how does that help? Maybe not directly.

Wait, going back to the expression for RT²:

RT² = -30a - 200 + 30aλ + 400λ + 25λ²

But this still has too many variables. I need to find λ. How?

Wait, maybe there's another condition involving λ. For example, since T is part of triangle TSR, maybe the line TS has some relation. Let me consider the coordinates of T: T_x = a - λ(a + 15), T_y = b(1 - λ). And S is at (10,0). So line TS connects T to S(10,0). What if there's a condition on this line?

Alternatively, since there's a triangle TSR, maybe the line TS has some property. But without more info, it's unclear.

Wait, but maybe we can use the fact that line TP is parallel to SQ. Since TP || SQ, and we have TP = λ * SQ. So the length of TP is |λ| times the length of SQ. The length of SQ is 5, so |TP| = 5|λ|. But TP is from T to P. So the length of TP is sqrt[(a - T_x)^2 + (b - T_y)^2]. Wait, but T_x = a - λ(a + 15), and T_y = b(1 - λ). So TP's coordinates difference is:

Δx = a - T_x = a - [a - λ(a + 15)] = λ(a + 15)
Δy = b - T_y = b - b(1 - λ) = bλ

So the length of TP is sqrt[ (λ(a + 15))^2 + (bλ)^2 ] = |λ| * sqrt[(a + 15)^2 + b^2] = |λ| * 5 (since (a + 15)^2 + b^2 = 25). 

So TP = 5|λ|

But TP is also a side of triangle PTR? Or part of triangle TSR? Not sure. However, if there's a relation between TP and other lengths, maybe we can find λ.

But how? Unless there's another condition involving TP. For example, if there's a triangle involving TP and other sides. 

Alternatively, since T is connected to R and S, maybe using the Law of Cosines or something in triangle RTS. But without knowing angles, it's tricky.

Wait, but we can express the coordinates of T in terms of a, b, and λ, and since S is at (10,0), maybe we can find another equation by ensuring that T satisfies some condition. Like, maybe the line RT passes through some point?

Wait, but RT is the line from R(0,0) to T, which is already defined. So no new info there.

Alternatively, since there's a triangle T, S, R, which is triangle TSR. The sides of this triangle are TR, TS, and SR. We know SR is 10 units (since RS is 10). So if we can find TR (which is x) and TS, then maybe using the Law of Cosines or something. But we don't know TS or the angles.

But wait, we can calculate TS using coordinates of T and S. Coordinates of T are (a - λ(a + 15), b(1 - λ)), and S is at (10,0). So TS squared is:

[10 - (a - λ(a + 15))]^2 + [0 - b(1 - λ)]^2

Expand that:

= [10 - a + λ(a + 15)]^2 + [ -b(1 - λ)]^2

= [ (10 - a) + λ(a + 15) ]^2 + b²(1 - λ)^2

Expand the first term:

= (10 - a)^2 + 2(10 - a)λ(a + 15) + λ²(a + 15)^2 + b²(1 - 2λ + λ²)

Again, this looks complex, but maybe combining terms:

= (10 - a)^2 + 2λ(10 - a)(a + 15) + λ²[(a + 15)^2 + b²] + b² - 2λb²

But again, (a + 15)^2 + b² = 25, so:

= (10 - a)^2 + 2λ(10 - a)(a + 15) + λ²*25 + b² - 2λb²

But we also know from earlier that a² + b² = -30a - 200. So b² = -30a - 200 - a².

Let me substitute that:

= (10 - a)^2 + 2λ(10 - a)(a + 15) + 25λ² + (-30a - 200 - a²) - 2λ(-30a - 200 - a²)

This is getting very messy. I'm starting to think there's a better way.

Let me revisit the earlier expression for RT². It was:

RT² = -30a - 200 + 30aλ + 400λ + 25λ²

But I need to find RT, which is x. To find x, I need to find the value of λ. But how?

Wait, maybe there's a relation between λ and the other variables. Let me think about the triangle PQR. In triangle PQR, we have points P(a,b), Q(a+25, b), R(0,0). Let me calculate the length PR and QR.

PR is the distance from P(a,b) to R(0,0): sqrt(a² + b²) = sqrt(-30a - 200) from earlier.

QR is the distance from Q(a+25, b) to R(0,0): sqrt((a+25)^2 + b^2). From earlier, we know that (a + 15)^2 + b^2 = 25, so expanding (a+25)^2 + b^2 = (a + 15 + 10)^2 + b^2 = (a + 15)^2 + 20(a + 15) + 100 + b^2 = [25] + 20(a + 15) + 100 = 25 + 20a + 300 + 100 = 20a + 425. So QR = sqrt(20a + 425).

But I don't know if this helps. 

Alternatively, since we have PR = sqrt(-30a - 200), and this must be a real number, so -30a - 200 ≥ 0 → a ≤ -200/30 ≈ -6.666...

But how does this help?

Wait, maybe I can find λ by considering that line RT passes through T, which is defined in terms of λ. But I'm stuck.

Let me try plugging in possible values. Since the answer options are numerical, maybe I can assume specific values for a and b that satisfy (a + 15)^2 + b^2 = 25 and then compute x.

For example, let me choose a value for a. Let's say a = -15. Then (a + 15)^2 + b^2 = 0 + b^2 = 25 → b = ±5. So possible points P could be (-15, 5) or (-15, -5). Let's take P(-15, 5). Then Q would be at (a + 25, b) = (-15 + 25, 5) = (10, 5). So Q is (10, 5). Then SQ is from S(10,0) to Q(10,5), which is vertical line, length 5, which matches the given SQ = 5. Great!

So this choice satisfies the conditions. Let me work with this case: a = -15, b = 5.

Now, with this, let's find λ. Recall that T = P - λ * SQ. Vector SQ is Q - S = (10 - 10, 5 - 0) = (0, 5). So SQ is (0,5). So T = P - λ * SQ = (-15, 5) - λ*(0,5) = (-15, 5 - 5λ).

Now, T is (-15, 5 - 5λ). Now, we need to ensure that T is part of triangle TSR. But what's the condition for that? Well, T must not be colinear with R and S, which it isn't since T has x-coordinate -15 ≠ 0 or 10. So T is valid.

Now, we need to find RT, which is the distance from R(0,0) to T(-15, 5 - 5λ). So RT² = (-15)^2 + (5 - 5λ)^2 = 225 + 25(1 - λ)^2.

But we need to find λ. How?

Wait, since T is part of triangle TSR, which includes points T, S(10,0), R(0,0). But how does that help? Maybe there's another condition. Wait, since TP || SQ, and we've already used that to define T. But in this case, with a = -15, b = 5, let's verify TP || SQ.

Point T is (-15, 5 - 5λ). Point P is (-15, 5). So vector TP is P - T = (-15 - (-15), 5 - (5 - 5λ)) = (0, 5λ). Vector SQ is (0,5). So TP is (0, 5λ), which is parallel to SQ (0,5) since they are scalar multiples. So this checks out.

Now, since T is part of triangle TSR, and we need to find RT, but we still need to find λ. How?

Wait, maybe there's another condition involving the triangle TSR. Let me think. Since we have points T, S, R, and we know S is (10,0), R is (0,0). So the line TS connects T(-15, 5 - 5λ) to S(10,0). What's the condition on this line?

Is there any other given condition? The problem says that Line(R, T) exists, which it does. But I'm missing something here.

Wait, but we also have the line TP || SQ, which we've already used. Maybe there's another parallel line? Or perhaps there's a relation between the triangles?

Wait, in this setup, with a = -15, b = 5, and T(-15, 5 - 5λ), what else can we do?

Let me check if there's any other condition. For example, since T is part of triangle TSR, and we might need to use the fact that the lines RT and something else have a particular property? Or maybe there's a relation between the triangles PQR and TSR?

Alternatively, since we have TP || SQ, and we have PQ || RS, perhaps there's a similarity between triangles formed by these lines.

In this specific case, with a = -15, b = 5, let's see:

PQ is from (-15,5) to (10,5), which is horizontal. RS is from (0,0) to (10,0), also horizontal. So PQ || RS is satisfied.

TP is from T(-15, 5 - 5λ) to P(-15,5), which is vertical line (since x-coordinate is constant). SQ is from S(10,0) to Q(10,5), also vertical line. So TP || SQ is satisfied, since both are vertical.

So in this scenario, TP and SQ are both vertical lines. So the slope is infinite, hence parallel.

Now, what is the value of λ? It can be any value, but we need to find it. How?

Wait, since T is part of triangle TSR, which has vertices at T(-15, 5 - 5λ), S(10,0), and R(0,0). But there's no additional condition given. So perhaps there's another condition I haven't used yet.

Wait, the original problem mentions Triangle(T, S, R). So the triangle TSR exists. But unless there's more information about it, like angles or other sides, I can't proceed. But maybe there's another condition from the parallel lines?

Wait, since TP is parallel to SQ, and we've already ensured that, but in this case, TP is vertical and SQ is vertical, so they are parallel. But how does this help us find λ?

Ah! Wait, since TP is parallel to SQ, and TP is part of triangle PTR, but I don't see how that helps. Wait, but in this specific case, TP is vertical, and SQ is vertical. So λ can be any value, but we need to determine it from another condition.

Wait, but there's no other condition. So this suggests that my assumption of a = -15 and b = 5 might not be sufficient, and I need to find λ in another way.

Wait, but maybe there's a relation from the fact that line RT is part of the triangle TSR. For example, the line RT goes from R(0,0) to T(-15, 5 - 5λ). So the slope of RT is (5 - 5λ)/(-15). But I don't see how this helps.

Wait, but maybe there's a relation between the slopes of RT and other lines? For example, if there's a condition that line RT is parallel to something? But the problem doesn't mention any other parallel lines.

Wait, the original problem states Parallel(Line(P, Q), Line(R, S)) and Parallel(Line(T, P), Line(S, Q)). We've already used the second one to define T. But what about the first one? It's already satisfied since both are horizontal.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I need to use the fact that in triangle TSR, the sides must satisfy certain conditions. For example, using the Law of Cosines or something. But without knowing any angles or other sides, it's impossible.

Wait, but in this specific case, with a = -15, b = 5, and T(-15, 5 - 5λ), let's calculate RT. RT is from (0,0) to (-15, 5 - 5λ), so RT squared is (-15)^2 + (5 - 5λ)^2 = 225 + 25(1 - λ)^2.

But we need to find λ. How?

Wait, perhaps there's a condition that the line RT passes through some point? Or that it creates a certain type of triangle? Or maybe the fact that T is connected to S(10,0) and R(0,0) implies that the line TS has a certain property?

Let me calculate the slope of TS. T is (-15, 5 - 5λ), S is (10,0). Slope of TS is [0 - (5 - 5λ)] / [10 - (-15)] = [-5 + 5λ]/25 = (5λ - 5)/25 = (λ - 1)/5.

But I don't see how this helps. 

Wait, but maybe there's a relation between the slopes of TS and something else. For example, if there's a condition that TS is parallel to something? The problem doesn't state any, so I can't assume.

At this point, I think I'm missing a key insight. Let me step back.

Since PQ || RS and TP || SQ, maybe there's a way to use the intercept theorem (Thales' theorem) or something similar.

Let me consider the lines PQ and RS being parallel. Let me imagine a transversal cutting them, like line PR or something. But I need to identify such a transversal.

Alternatively, since TP || SQ, and PQ || RS, maybe there's a parallelogram or a series of similar triangles.

Let me try to use vectors again. Since PQ || RS, and TP || SQ, then the vectors PQ and RS are scalar multiples, and vectors TP and SQ are scalar multiples.

Let me denote vector PQ = 25 units in the direction of RS (which is 10 units). So the ratio of PQ to RS is 25/10 = 5/2.

Since TP || SQ, and SQ is 5 units, then TP would be some multiple of SQ. Let me denote the ratio between TP and SQ as k, so TP = k * SQ. Then, since PQ || RS, and TP || SQ, perhaps there's a relation between these ratios.

But how? Let me think about the triangles formed by these lines.

Consider triangle PQR and triangle SRT? Or some other triangles?

Alternatively, since PQ || RS, the ratio of PR to RS might be related to some other ratio.

Wait, let me think about the vectors again. Since PQ is parallel to RS, and TP is parallel to SQ, then the entire figure might be a combination of similar triangles.

Let me try to find the ratio between PR and something. PR is the vector from R to P, which in our coordinate system is from (0,0) to (a,b). And RS is from R(0,0) to S(10,0). 

If I consider the vector PR and RS, since PQ is parallel to RS, maybe there's a relation between PR and PQ?

Not directly. But since PQ is parallel to RS, and TP is parallel to SQ, perhaps there's a homothety (scaling) transformation that maps one to the other.

Alternatively, since TP || SQ and PQ || RS, the figure might be a parallelogram. But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, in our specific example where a = -15, b = 5, we have PQ from (-15,5) to (10,5), RS from (0,0) to (10,0). So PQ and RS are both horizontal. TP is from T(-15, 5 - 5λ) to P(-15,5), which is vertical, and SQ is from S(10,0) to Q(10,5), which is also vertical. So TP and SQ are both vertical, hence parallel.

Now, in this case, what is the value of λ? Let me think. Since T is part of triangle TSR, which has points T, S(10,0), R(0,0). But how to find λ?

Wait, in this case, since TP is vertical, and T is at (-15, 5 - 5λ), and P is at (-15,5), then the line TP is vertical, as said. Now, since T is part of triangle TSR, and we need to find RT, but without more conditions, it seems underdetermined. This suggests that there might be an infinite number of solutions unless there's another condition.

But the problem provides specific answer choices, so there must be a unique solution. Hence, my assumption of a = -15, b = 5 might be leading me to a dead end. Perhaps I need to choose a different a and b that satisfies (a + 15)^2 + b^2 = 25.

Let me pick another value for a. Let's say a = -10. Then (a + 15)^2 + b^2 = (5)^2 + b^2 = 25 + b^2 = 25 → b = 0. So P would be at (-10, 0). Then Q would be at (-10 + 25, 0) = (15, 0). So Q is (15, 0). Then SQ is from S(10,0) to Q(15,0), which is horizontal, length 5, which matches. Great!

So in this case, P is (-10, 0), Q is (15, 0), R is (0,0), S is (10,0). Now, let's find T.

Vector SQ is Q - S = (15 - 10, 0 -
