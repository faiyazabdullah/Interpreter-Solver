<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a circle B, and points A, C, E, F on it. Also, there are lines AF and CE, which are perpendicular. Points D lies on both lines AF and CE, so D is the intersection point of those two lines. The question says that CE equals 13.5, and we need to find BD. 

First, I need to visualize this. Let me sketch a rough diagram mentally. There's a circle with center B. Points A, C, E, F are on the circumference. Lines AF and CE intersect at point D. Since AF and CE are perpendicular, they form a right angle at D. Also, since A, C, E, F are on the circle, maybe some properties of chords or radii come into play here. 

Given that CE is 13.5 units long. Wait, but CE is a chord of the circle. Also, since AF and CE are perpendicular, maybe we can use the Pythagorean theorem somewhere? But how?

Let me recall some circle theorems. The length of a chord relates to its distance from the center. Also, if two chords intersect, there's a relation between the segments. Wait, but here AF and CE are chords intersecting at D. There's a theorem that says when two chords intersect, the products of the segments are equal. So AD*DF = CD*DE. Hmm, that seems useful. But do I know any of these segment lengths?

Wait, but we don't know the lengths of AF or CE except CE is 13.5. However, CE is a chord. Also, since B is the center, BA, BC, BE, BF are radii. Given that the radius length is 8 because IsRadiusOf(Line(A,B), Circle(B)) and Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), 8). So the radius is 8. Therefore, BA = BC = BE = BF = 8. 

So points A, C, E, F are all on the circle with radius 8. Now, CE is a chord of the circle. Let me compute its length. Wait, CE is given as 13.5. Wait, but the maximum possible length of a chord in a circle is the diameter, which would be 16 (since radius is 8). So 13.5 is less than 16, so that's okay. 

But how does this relate to the rest? Maybe we can find the distance from the center B to the chord CE? Because if we can find that, then maybe we can find coordinates or something. Alternatively, since AF and CE are perpendicular chords intersecting at D, perhaps we can use the formula involving the distances from the center?

Alternatively, since D is the intersection point of AF and CE, which are chords, and they are perpendicular. Let me think about coordinate geometry. Maybe assign coordinates to make it easier.

Let me place the circle with center B at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, since BA is a radius, let me assume point A is at (8,0), so that BA is along the x-axis. Then, since AF is a line passing through A and F, which is another point on the circle. Similarly, CE is a line passing through C and E, which are also on the circle, and AF and CE are perpendicular.

But maybe choosing coordinates complicates things. Let me see if there's another way. Since AF and CE are perpendicular chords intersecting at D, and we know CE's length. Also, BD is the distance from the center to the point D? Or wait, BD is the length from B to D? Wait, the question asks for BD. So D is the intersection point of AF and CE. We need to find the length from B to D.

Hmm. Let me consider the power of a point. For point D lying inside the circle, the product of the segments of one chord equals the product for the other chord. So AD * DF = CD * DE. Also, since AF and CE are perpendicular, maybe we can express AD, DF, CD, DE in terms of variables and use the fact that CE = 13.5.

But first, let me note that CE = 13.5. Let me denote CD = x and DE = y. Then x + y = 13.5. Also, since AF is another chord intersecting at D, let me denote AD = m and DF = n. Then m*n = x*y.

Additionally, since AF is a chord passing through D, the entire length AF = m + n. Also, since AF is a chord of the circle with radius 8, its length can be found if we know its distance from the center. But maybe we need more relations.

Alternatively, since AF and CE are perpendicular, perhaps we can use the Pythagorean theorem with the distances from the center. Wait, but how?

Another thought: Since B is the center, and we have two chords AF and CE intersecting at D. Let me recall that the distance from the center to each chord can be calculated using the formula: if a chord of length l is at distance d from the center, then l = 2√(r² - d²). So for chord CE, length 13.5, r=8, so:

13.5 = 2√(8² - d_CE²), where d_CE is the distance from B to CE. Solving for d_CE:

Divide both sides by 2: 13.5 / 2 = √(64 - d_CE²)

Compute 13.5 / 2 = 6.75. So:

6.75 = √(64 - d_CE²)

Square both sides: 6.75² = 64 - d_CE²

Calculate 6.75 squared: 6.75 * 6.75. Let me compute that. 6^2 = 36, 0.75^2 = 0.5625, cross term 2*6*0.75 = 9. So total is 36 + 9 + 0.5625 = 45.5625. So:

45.5625 = 64 - d_CE² → d_CE² = 64 - 45.5625 = 18.4375 → d_CE = sqrt(18.4375). Let me calculate that. sqrt(18.4375) ≈ 4.293. So the distance from center B to chord CE is approximately 4.293 units. 

Similarly, for chord AF, if we could find its length, we could find its distance from B. But we don't know AF's length yet. However, since AF and CE are perpendicular, maybe there's a relation between their distances from the center?

Alternatively, since D is the intersection of AF and CE, and we know that the distance from B to CE is ~4.293, and the distance from B to AF can be found once we know AF's length. But how does that help us find BD?

Wait, BD is the distance from B to D. But D lies on both chords AF and CE. So BD is a line from the center to point D. But how can we find BD?

Alternatively, considering coordinates again. Let me try setting up coordinates with B at (0,0). Let me suppose that chord CE is horizontal for simplicity, since its distance from B is d_CE. Let me align CE horizontally. Let me say that the midpoint of CE is at (h, k), such that the distance from B (origin) to CE is |k|, assuming CE is horizontal. Wait, but earlier calculation said the distance from B to CE is approx 4.293. So if CE is horizontal, then its equation would be y = k, where |k| = d_CE ≈ 4.293. 

Since CE has length 13.5, its midpoint M is located at distance d_CE from B. The midpoint M of CE would lie along the line perpendicular to CE passing through B. Wait, but since CE is horizontal, the perpendicular is vertical. So the midpoint M of CE would lie along the vertical line passing through B. Wait, but CE is horizontal, so its perpendicular bisector is vertical. Therefore, the midpoint of CE lies along the vertical line through B. Hence, the midpoint M of CE has coordinates (0, k) if CE is horizontal. Wait, but if CE is horizontal and its midpoint is vertically aligned with B, then yes.

So let me define coordinates:

Let’s set up coordinate system with B at (0,0).

Assume chord CE is horizontal. Its midpoint M is along the vertical line through B. Let’s say the midpoint M has coordinates (0, m). Since the distance from B to CE is |m|. Earlier, we found that d_CE ≈ 4.293, so m = ±d_CE. Let me take m positive for simplicity, so m = 4.293. Thus, the midpoint M of CE is at (0, m). Then, the endpoints C and E are located symmetrically around M. The length of CE is 13.5, so half-length is 13.5 / 2 = 6.75. Therefore, coordinates of C and E would be (-6.75, m) and (6.75, m), respectively. Wait, but CE is horizontal, so y-coordinate same for C and E. Wait, but if the midpoint is at (0, m), then C would be at (-6.75, m) and E at (6.75, m). 

Now, since CE is horizontal, and AF is perpendicular to CE, so AF is vertical. Therefore, AF is a vertical line passing through D, which is the intersection point of AF and CE. Since CE is horizontal, and AF is vertical, their intersection D is the point where vertical line meets CE. But CE is horizontal, so D lies on CE. Wait, but AF is vertical, so D must be on CE. Wait, but AF passes through D, which is on CE. So D is the foot of the vertical line AF on CE. 

But since AF is a vertical chord passing through D, which is on CE. Let me think. Let me find coordinates of D. Since CE is horizontal from (-6.75, m) to (6.75, m). The vertical line AF passes through D, which lies on CE. Let me denote D as (x, m). But since AF is vertical, it's a vertical line passing through D. So AF is the line x = x_D. But AF is a vertical chord of the circle. 

Also, since AF is a vertical chord passing through D(x_D, m). Let me find the points A and F on this vertical line. Since the circle has equation x² + y² = 8² = 64. The vertical line x = x_D intersects the circle at points where x = x_D, so substituting into circle equation:

x_D² + y² = 64 → y² = 64 - x_D². Therefore, the points A and F are (x_D, sqrt(64 - x_D²)) and (x_D, -sqrt(64 - x_D²)). But since AF is a vertical line, and D is the intersection point of AF and CE, which is on CE. So D is (x_D, m). Therefore, D lies on AF, so its x-coordinate is x_D. And since D lies on CE, whose y-coordinate is m. Therefore, D is (x_D, m). 

Thus, the y-coordinate of D is m, which is the distance from B to CE. Wait, but earlier we computed m as 4.293. So D is at (x_D, 4.293). Now, since D is also on AF, which is the vertical line x = x_D. Let me find the coordinates of A and F. 

Point A is one end of AF. Suppose A is above D, and F is below D, or vice versa. But since AF is a chord, depending on where D is. However, without loss of generality, let's assume that A is the upper intersection and F is the lower. So coordinates of A would be (x_D, sqrt(64 - x_D²)) and F would be (x_D, -sqrt(64 - x_D²)). But since D is on AF, which is the vertical line x=x_D, then D has coordinates (x_D, m). Therefore, m must be between the y-coordinates of A and F. 

But m is the y-coordinate of D, which is on AF. Therefore, m must satisfy -sqrt(64 - x_D²) ≤ m ≤ sqrt(64 - x_D²). 

Now, since AF and CE are perpendicular, and we've aligned them as vertical and horizontal. Now, we need to find BD. B is at (0,0), D is at (x_D, m). Therefore, BD is the distance from (0,0) to (x_D, m):

BD = sqrt(x_D² + m²). 

So our goal is to find BD, which is sqrt(x_D² + m²). 

We already know m is the distance from B to CE, which we calculated as sqrt(18.4375) ≈ 4.293. Wait, earlier calculation gave m = 4.293. Let me confirm:

Earlier, for CE's length 13.5, we had:

CE = 2√(r² - d²) ⇒ 13.5 = 2√(64 - d²) ⇒ 6.75 = √(64 - d²) ⇒ square both sides: 45.5625 = 64 - d² ⇒ d² = 64 - 45.5625 = 18.4375 ⇒ d = sqrt(18.4375). Let me compute sqrt(18.4375):

Well, 18.4375 = 18 + 0.4375. 0.4375 is 7/16. So sqrt(18 + 7/16). Let me convert to decimal. 18.4375 = 18.4375. sqrt(18.4375) ≈ 4.293. Yes.

So m = sqrt(18.4375) ≈ 4.293. 

Therefore, BD = sqrt(x_D² + m²). So if we can find x_D, we can compute BD. How?

Well, since D lies on AF, which is the vertical line x = x_D, and D is also on CE, which is horizontal at y = m. Additionally, since AF is a chord of the circle, and D is a point on AF. 

Moreover, we can use the power of point D with respect to the circle. The power of D is equal to DA * DF = DC * DE. 

From earlier, DA * DF = DC * DE. Let me write expressions for DA, DF, DC, DE. 

DA is the distance from D to A. Since A is (x_D, sqrt(64 - x_D²)) and D is (x_D, m), then DA = sqrt( (x_D - x_D)^2 + (sqrt(64 - x_D²) - m)^2 ) = sqrt(0 + (sqrt(64 - x_D²) - m)^2 ) = |sqrt(64 - x_D²) - m|. Similarly, DF is the distance from D to F, which is |sqrt(64 - x_D²) + m|. Wait, because F is at (x_D, -sqrt(...)), so the difference would be m - (-sqrt(...))? Wait, let me recheck:

Coordinates of D: (x_D, m). Coordinates of A: (x_D, sqrt(64 - x_D²)). So DA is the vertical distance between A and D: |sqrt(64 - x_D²) - m|. Similarly, DF is the distance between D and F, which is at (x_D, -sqrt(64 - x_D²)), so vertical distance is |m - (-sqrt(64 - x_D²))| = |m + sqrt(64 - x_D²)|. 

Therefore, DA * DF = |sqrt(64 - x_D²) - m| * |m + sqrt(64 - x_D²)|. This simplifies to |(sqrt(64 - x_D²))^2 - m^2| = |(64 - x_D²) - m^2| = |64 - x_D² - m^2|. 

On the other hand, DC * DE. Points C and E are at (-6.75, m) and (6.75, m). D is at (x_D, m). So DC is the horizontal distance from D to C: |-6.75 - x_D| = | -6.75 - x_D | = |x_D + 6.75|. Similarly, DE is the horizontal distance from D to E: |6.75 - x_D|. Therefore, DC * DE = |x_D + 6.75| * |6.75 - x_D| = |(6.75)^2 - x_D^2|. 

So equating DA * DF = DC * DE:

|64 - x_D² - m²| = |(6.75)^2 - x_D²|

This gives:

Either 64 - x_D² - m² = (6.75)^2 - x_D², or -(64 - x_D² - m²) = (6.75)^2 - x_D².

Simplifying first case: 64 - m² = (6.75)^2 → 64 - m² = 45.5625 → m² = 64 - 45.5625 = 18.4375. Which is exactly what we found earlier! So that holds true. Therefore, this equality is satisfied. 

But this doesn't give us new information. It just confirms our previous calculation. So we need another equation to find x_D. 

Wait, but maybe there's another relationship. Since D lies on AF and CE, and AF is vertical, and CE is horizontal. Also, since AF is a chord, and we have points A and F on the circle. Also, since BD is the distance from B to D, which is sqrt(x_D² + m²). But we need to find BD. However, we need to find x_D. 

Is there another condition that can help us find x_D? Let me think. Perhaps the fact that AF is a chord, and D is a point on it. But without knowing more about AF's length or position, how?

Wait, but we can use the fact that D is the intersection of AF and CE. Also, since AF is a vertical line x = x_D, and CE is horizontal line y = m. But we also know that points A and F are on the circle. 

Alternatively, since AF is a vertical chord, the midpoint of AF is the projection of B onto AF. Because for any chord, the line from the center to the midpoint of the chord is perpendicular to the chord. Since AF is vertical, the midpoint of AF lies along the horizontal line through B. Wait, no. The line from the center to the midpoint of the chord is perpendicular to the chord. Since AF is vertical, the line from B to the midpoint of AF is horizontal. Therefore, the midpoint of AF is (something, 0), since it's horizontal. 

Wait, midpoint of AF is the midpoint between A and F. Since A is (x_D, sqrt(64 - x_D²)) and F is (x_D, -sqrt(64 - x_D²)), the midpoint of AF is (x_D, 0). So the midpoint of AF is (x_D, 0). Therefore, the line from B (which is at (0,0)) to the midpoint of AF (which is (x_D, 0)) is horizontal, which is indeed perpendicular to AF (vertical). That checks out. 

Now, the distance from B to the midpoint of AF is |x_D - 0| = |x_D|. Also, the length of AF can be calculated. Since AF is a vertical chord with midpoint at (x_D, 0). The length of AF is 2*sqrt(r² - (distance_from_center_to_midpoint)^2). Wait, the formula for chord length is 2√(r² - d²), where d is the distance from the center to the chord. Here, the distance from B to AF is the horizontal distance from (0,0) to the line AF, which is the horizontal line x = x_D. Wait, no: the distance from B to the chord AF is the horizontal distance from B to the line x = x_D, which is |x_D|. 

Therefore, length of AF is 2√(r² - x_D²) = 2√(64 - x_D²). 

But we also know that AF is a chord passing through D. The point D divides AF into segments AD and DF. From earlier, DA * DF = |64 - x_D² - m²| = |(6.75)^2 - x_D²|, which was already accounted for. But how does that help us?

Alternatively, since we have BD = sqrt(x_D² + m²). If we can find x_D, then we can compute BD. But how?

Wait, but we can relate x_D to something else. Let me think. Since D lies on CE, which is horizontal at y = m. Also, D lies on AF, which is vertical at x = x_D. Also, since AF is a vertical chord, and D is on AF, we can find coordinates of D as (x_D, m). Also, since D is on AF, which goes from A to F, and since A and F are points on the circle, maybe we can find x_D by using the fact that D lies on the circle? No, because D is inside the circle (as it's the intersection of two chords), so it's not necessarily on the circle. 

Wait, unless... Wait, but in this setup, D is inside the circle. So BD is the distance from B to D, which is sqrt(x_D² + m²). But how do we find x_D? 

Wait, maybe we can use the fact that D lies on both AF and CE. But CE is fixed with midpoint at (0, m). Wait, but earlier we assumed CE's midpoint is at (0, m), but actually, the midpoint of CE is the point M which lies along the line perpendicular to CE through B. Since CE is horizontal, that line is vertical, so midpoint M is on the vertical line through B. So midpoint M is (0, m). Therefore, the midpoint of CE is (0, m). But CE has length 13.5, so the coordinates of C and E are (-6.75, m) and (6.75, m). 

Now, D is the intersection of AF and CE. Since AF is vertical line x = x_D, and CE is horizontal line y = m. So D is (x_D, m). 

But also, since AF is a vertical chord passing through D, and the midpoint of AF is (x_D, 0). So the midpoint of AF is (x_D, 0). Also, since D is a point on AF, which is the vertical line x = x_D, and the midpoint of AF is (x_D, 0). Therefore, the midpoint of AF is directly below D on the y-axis. 

So the vector from D to the midpoint of AF is (0, -m), since D is at (x_D, m) and midpoint is at (x_D, 0). Therefore, the distance from D to the midpoint of AF is m units. 

But the midpoint of AF is at distance |x_D| from B, since it's at (x_D, 0). Wait, the midpoint of AF is at (x_D, 0), so its distance from B is sqrt(x_D² + 0²) = |x_D|. 

Also, the length of AF is 2√(64 - x_D²), as before. The distance from the midpoint of AF to D is m. Since D divides AF into segments AD and DF. The midpoint of AF divides AF into two equal parts. So the length from midpoint to D is m, and the total length of AF is 2√(64 - x_D²). 

But the distance from midpoint to D is m, which is part of the chord AF. So if we consider the midpoint of AF being at (x_D, 0), and D is at (x_D, m), then the distance between them is m. Also, the full length of AF is 2√(64 - x_D²). Let me think about the relation between m and the length of AF. 

Alternatively, using the formula for the distance from the midpoint of a chord to a point on the chord. In general, if you have a chord of length L, and a point dividing it into segments of length p and q, then p*q = ... Well, earlier we used power of a point. But in this case, D is a point on AF, so DA * DF = DC * DE, which we already did. 

Wait, but we can also express DA and DF in terms of the midpoint. The midpoint M_AF of AF is at (x_D, 0), and D is at (x_D, m). So the distance from M_AF to D is m. Also, the length of AF is 2√(64 - x_D²). Let me denote the length of AF as L = 2√(64 - x_D²). Then, since D is a point on AF, the segments DA and DF can be expressed in terms of the position of D relative to the midpoint. 

Since the midpoint divides AF into two equal halves, each of length L/2. If D is located at a distance of m from the midpoint towards one direction, then DA = L/2 + m and DF = L/2 - m, or vice versa, depending on the side. Wait, no. If the midpoint is between A and F, then moving from the midpoint to D, which is m units away along the chord. Since AF is vertical, and D is m units above the midpoint. So DA is the distance from D to A, which would be (L/2) + m, and DF is (L/2) - m. But since D is between A and F, depending on whether D is closer to A or F. 

Wait, but D is on AF. Let me think: if the midpoint is at (x_D, 0), and D is at (x_D, m), then if m is positive, D is above the midpoint. So from the midpoint upwards, towards A. So the distance from D to A would be (L/2 - m)? No, wait. The total length from midpoint to A is L/2. If D is m units above the midpoint, then DA = L/2 - m. Wait, no. Imagine the midpoint is halfway between A and F. If you move up from the midpoint by m units towards A, then DA would be the distance from D to A, which is (total length from midpoint to A) minus m? Not sure. Let me draw it mentally:

Midpoint M_AF is at (x_D, 0). A is at (x_D, sqrt(64 - x_D²)), and F is at (x_D, -sqrt(64 - x_D²)). So the distance from M_AF to A is sqrt( (x_D - x_D)^2 + (sqrt(...) - 0)^2 ) = sqrt( (sqrt(64 - x_D²))^2 ) = sqrt(64 - x_D²). Wait, no, that's the length from midpoint to A. Wait, midpoint is at (x_D, 0), and A is at (x_D, sqrt(...)), so the distance between them is sqrt( (sqrt(64 - x_D²) - 0)^2 ) = sqrt(64 - x_D²). Wait, but the length of AF is 2*sqrt(64 - x_D²). So the distance from midpoint to A is half of AF, which is sqrt(64 - x_D²). 

But D is at (x_D, m), which is m units above the midpoint. So the distance from D to A is the distance from (x_D, m) to (x_D, sqrt(64 - x_D²)) which is |sqrt(64 - x_D²) - m|. Similarly, the distance from D to F is |m - (-sqrt(...))| = m + sqrt(...). 

But earlier, we had DA * DF = |(sqrt(...))^2 - m^2| = |64 - x_D² - m²|. And also, from power of point, DC * DE = |(6.75)^2 - x_D²|. 

But since these are equal, we have:

|64 - x_D² - m²| = |(6.75)^2 - x_D²|

Which we already know is true because m² = 18.4375 and 6.75² is 45.5625, so 64 - 45.5625 = 18.4375. So this equation holds for any x_D. Thus, it doesn't provide new info.

So we're stuck here. How to find x_D? Maybe we need to consider that D is the intersection point of AF and CE, and there's another relation. Wait, but we have two equations:

1. m² = 18.4375 (from CE's length)
2. BD = sqrt(x_D² + m²)

But we don't know x_D. Unless there's another condition. Wait, but maybe we can use the fact that AF is a vertical line passing through D, and that A is on the circle. 

Wait, point A is on the circle, so its coordinates (x_D, sqrt(64 - x_D²)) must satisfy the circle equation. But that's already ensured. 

Wait, but what about the fact that D lies on CE, which has endpoints C(-6.75, m) and E(6.75, m). So D is at (x_D, m). But x_D is the x-coordinate of D. Since D is on CE, which runs from x=-6.75 to x=6.75 at y=m. So x_D must be between -6.75 and 6.75. 

But this still doesn't give us x_D. 

Wait, maybe there's another property. Since AF and CE are perpendicular, and D is their intersection. Also, BD is the line from B to D, which we want to find. 

Alternatively, since BD connects B to D, and D is at (x_D, m). So BD² = x_D² + m². If we can find x_D², we can compute BD. 

But how? Let's think differently. 

Let me recall that in a circle, if two chords intersect at D, then DA * DF = DC * DE. We already used this. But we also know that DA * DF = |(sqrt(64 - x_D²))^2 - m²| = |64 - x_D² - m²|. And DC * DE = |(6.75)^2 - x_D²|. Setting them equal gives:

64 - x_D² - m² = (6.75)^2 - x_D² → 64 - m² = (6.75)^2 → which is true. So this doesn't help us find x_D. 

So this suggests that x_D can be any value, as long as the conditions are met. But that can't be. There must be a unique value for BD. So where am I missing?

Ah! Wait, but BD is the distance from B to D, which is sqrt(x_D² + m²). But since D lies on CE, which has a fixed y-coordinate m, and x_D ranges between -6.75 and 6.75. But without more information, x_D can vary, making BD vary. But the problem states that CE = 13.5 and asks for BD. So there must be a unique answer, implying that BD is determined uniquely. 

This suggests that my assumption that AF is arbitrary is incorrect. Perhaps there's another constraint. 

Wait, let me check the original predicates. There is also a point F on the circle, and Line(A,F), and PointLiesOnCircle(F, Circle(B)). Also, PointLiesOnLine(D, Line(A,F)), so D is on AF. Also, Perpendicular(Line(A,F), Line(C,E)), so AF ⊥ CE. 

Wait, but we also have that AF is a chord passing through D. But since AF is perpendicular to CE, and CE has a fixed length. Maybe there's another relation. 

Wait, but earlier, I considered coordinates where CE is horizontal, AF is vertical. But maybe there's a specific position of D that satisfies all conditions. Wait, but how? 

Wait, but if AF is perpendicular to CE, then the slopes of AF and CE are negative reciprocals. Since CE is horizontal (slope 0), then AF must be vertical (infinite slope), which matches our earlier assumption. So AF is vertical, CE is horizontal. 

But in this setup, the position of D is anywhere along CE, and AF is vertical through D. But since AF is a chord, the length of AF depends on x_D. But the problem doesn't give any other information about AF. So why is BD uniquely determined?

Wait, the problem says "In ⊙ B, CE = 13.5". So CE is a chord of length 13.5. But we also have that AF is a chord perpendicular to CE at D. But since AF is a chord, its length depends on its distance from the center. But since AF is perpendicular to CE, and we know CE's distance from the center, maybe there's a relation between the distances of AF and CE from the center?

Let me think. For two perpendicular chords, there's a relation between their distances from the center? Not sure. But if I consider the distances from B to CE and from B to AF, let's call them d1 and d2. Then, for chord CE, d1 = sqrt(18.4375) ≈ 4.293. For chord AF, its distance from B is |x_D|, since it's the horizontal distance from B to the vertical line x = x_D. 

Then, the length of AF is 2√(r² - d2²) = 2√(64 - x_D²). But how does this relate to anything?

But since AF and CE are perpendicular, maybe there's a relation between d1 and d2. Like, in some cases, for perpendicular chords, the sum of squares of their distances equals the square of the radius? Not sure. Let me test with example. If two perpendicular chords, their distances from the center satisfy d1² + d2² = r²? Let me see. 

Suppose two perpendicular chords, one at distance d1 from center, other at distance d2. Are there any relations between d1, d2, and r? Not directly. For example, if both chords pass through the center, they are diameters, and d1 = d2 = 0. But they are perpendicular. So in that case, 0² + 0² = 0 ≠ r². So that doesn't hold. 

Alternatively, maybe the product of their distances equals something? Not sure. 

Alternatively, since AF and CE are perpendicular, and intersect at D. Let me consider the coordinates again. D is at (x_D, m). B is at (0,0). So BD is sqrt(x_D² + m²). Also, since D lies on AF, which is vertical, and AF has a certain length. But we need to find x_D.

Wait, but in this scenario, there's no restriction on x_D. So why is BD uniquely determined? This suggests that there's missing information or an error in assumptions. 

Wait, but wait! Let me think about the fact that D is the intersection of AF and CE. Since AF is a chord, and CE is a chord, and they are perpendicular. But since AF is a chord passing through D, and CE is a chord passing through D, and AF ⊥ CE. 

But we have the lengths of CE, and we need to find BD. Perhaps there's a relation using the Pythagorean theorem with the distances from the center to each chord. 

Let me consider that the distance from B to CE is d1 = sqrt(18.4375), and the distance from B to AF is d2 = |x_D|. Since AF and CE are perpendicular, perhaps the distance from B to D can be found via Pythagoras? Because BD is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs d1 and d2? 

Wait, if BD is the distance from B to D, and D lies on both chords AF and CE, which are at distances d1 and d2 from B. But how are these distances related to BD?

Actually, D is a point where two chords meet. The distances from B to each chord are d1 and d2. But D is not necessarily the foot of the perpendicular from B to either chord. So this might not directly apply. 

Wait, but let me consider vectors. The position vector of D is (x_D, m). The distance from B to D is sqrt(x_D² + m²). But x_D is the horizontal distance from B to the vertical line AF, and m is the vertical distance from B to the horizontal line CE. 

But since AF and CE are perpendicular, maybe there's a relation between x_D and m? For instance, if the lines AF and CE are perpendicular, then the product of their slopes is -1. But since AF is vertical (infinite slope) and CE is horizontal (slope 0), their product is undefined, but technically they are perpendicular. 

But how does this help? 

Wait, but if I consider the coordinates of D as (x_D, m), then BD is sqrt(x_D² + m²). We know m² = 18.4375. So if we can find x_D², then we can compute BD. 

But how to find x_D²? 

Wait, earlier, we had DA * DF = DC * DE. And DA * DF = |64 - x_D² - m²| = |64 - x_D² - 18.4375| = |45.5625 - x_D²|. On the other hand, DC * DE = |(6.75)^2 - x_D²| = |45.5625 - x_D²|. So both are equal. This means that this equality holds for any x_D. So x_D can be any value, as long as the points are defined. 

This implies that BD can vary depending on x_D. But the problem states that CE = 13.5 and asks for BD, suggesting that BD is uniquely determined. This contradiction indicates that there's an error in my reasoning. 

Wait, but maybe there's another condition I missed. Let me revisit the given predicates. 

Looking back, there's a predicate: IsRadiusOf(Line(A,B), Circle(B)). So AB is a radius, hence AB = 8. Also, PointLiesOnCircle(A, Circle(B)), so A is on the circle. Similarly for C, E, F. 

Also, Line(A,F) is a line, and PointLiesOnLine(D, Line(A,F)), so D is on AF. Also, Line(C,E) is a line, and D is on it. 

But what about the position of D? Is there any other condition? 

Wait, but since AF is a chord passing through D, and A is on the circle, F is on the circle. So AF is a chord, and D is a point on it. But since we don't have any other conditions on AF, like its length or position, x_D can vary. 

But the problem must have a unique answer, so there must be something wrong in my assumptions. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that AF is vertical. Let me think. If CE is horizontal and AF is perpendicular to it, then AF must be vertical. But in reality, the orientation of the chords depends on the specific configuration. However, since the problem gives specific lengths and asks for BD, there must be a unique solution. 

Maybe I should use coordinate geometry with specific values. Let me try assigning coordinates with B at (0,0), CE horizontal, and AF vertical. As before, CE has length 13.5, so mid-point at (0, m), m = sqrt(18.4375). D is at (x_D, m). 

Now, since D is on AF, which is vertical line x = x_D. Also, AF is a chord of the circle, so points A and F are on the circle. Let me find the coordinates of A and F. 

For a vertical line x = x_D intersecting the circle x² + y² = 64, the points are (x_D, y) where y = ±sqrt(64 - x_D²). So A and F are (x_D, sqrt(64 - x_D²)) and (x_D, -sqrt(64 - x_D²)). 

But D is at (x_D, m), so m must be between -sqrt(64 - x_D²) and sqrt(64 - x_D²). Since m is positive (we took it as positive), then m ≤ sqrt(64 - x_D²). 

So m = sqrt(18.4375) ≈ 4.293. So 4.293 ≤ sqrt(64 - x_D²) → 64 - x_D² ≥ 18.4375 → x_D² ≤ 64 - 18.4375 = 45.5625 → x_D ≤ sqrt(45.5625) = 6.75. Which matches the range of x_D being between -6.75 and 6.75, as CE extends from x = -6.75 to 6.75. 

So x_D can be any value between -6.75 and 6.75. But how to determine x_D? 

Wait, but since D is the intersection of AF and CE, and AF is a vertical line passing through D, and CE is horizontal. But there's no other condition. So unless there's a specific position of D, like being the midpoint, but there's no indication of that. 

Wait, but maybe the fact that AF is a chord passing through D, and D is also on CE, which has a fixed length, but how does that help?

Wait, let me think of the following: Since D is on both AF and CE, and AF is a vertical line, and CE is horizontal, then D is the only intersection point. But how to find x_D? 

Wait, but perhaps there's a relation between the lengths of AF and CE? 

No, because AF's length depends on x_D, and CE is fixed. 

Wait, but since AF and CE are perpendicular, and intersect at D, maybe there's a relation between the lengths of AF and CE. But I don't recall such a theorem. 

Alternatively, since BD is the distance from B to D, which is sqrt(x_D² + m²), and m is fixed, but x_D is variable. This suggests that BD can vary, which contradicts the problem having a unique answer. 

This implies that there must be an error in my assumptions. Let me re-examine the problem statement. 

Wait, the question says "In ⊙ B, CE = 13.5. Find BD." So CE is a chord of the circle, and BD is the distance from B to D, where D is the intersection of AF and CE, with AF perpendicular to CE. 

Wait, but maybe there's a property that in a circle, if two perpendicular chords intersect, then the sum of the squares of the segments equals the square of the radius? Or something like that. 

Let me think: If two chords intersect at D, and are perpendicular, then BD² = (AD * DF + CD * DE)/2? Not sure. 

Alternatively, let me use coordinates again. Let me recall that BD = sqrt(x_D² + m²). And m is fixed. If I can find x_D in terms of known quantities. 

But how? 

Wait, let me think about the power of point D with respect to the circle. The power of D is DA * DF = DC * DE. But we also know that the power of D is equal to OD² - r², where O is the center. Wait, no, the power of a point D with respect to the circle is equal to DA * DF = DC * DE = DB² - r² if D is outside, or r² - DB² if D is inside. Wait, no: the power of a point inside the circle is equal to -(DB² - r²), or more precisely, DA * DF = r² - OD², where O is the center. 

Yes, the power of point D with respect to the circle is equal to DA * DF = DC * DE = r² - OD². 

Here, O is B, the center. So DA * DF = r² - BD². 

But we also have from earlier, DA * DF = |64 - x_D² - m
