MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, C, D lying on a circle with center F. The problem mentions angles at point F involving these points. Let me start by recalling some circle theorems because there are several angles mentioned here.

First, the given predicates say that points A, B, C, D are all on circle F. That means F is the center since they mention it's a circle with diameter AC. Wait, wait—the question says "with diameter AC". Oh, so AC is the diameter of the circle. Therefore, the center of the circle must be the midpoint of AC. But the circle is named as Circle(F), so F is the center. So, F is the center, and AC is the diameter. That means AF = FC, since F is the center. 

Now, looking at the angles given. There's an angle ∠BFC measured as 72 degrees. Also, another angle ∠AFD is given as 4a - 1, and ∠AFB is 2a - 5. Wait, but the question asks for the measure of ∠AFB. Hmm. Wait, maybe I need to clarify the notation here. In angle notation, ∠(B, F, C) would mean the angle at point F between points B and C. Similarly, ∠(A, F, D) is the angle at F between A and D. And ∠(A, F, B) is the angle at F between A and B. 

So, since all points lie on the circle with center F, each of these angles is a central angle. Because the vertex is at the center of the circle. Central angles correspond to arcs. The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc. So, for example, ∠BFC intercepts arc BC, and its measure is 72 degrees. Similarly, ∠AFD intercepts arc AD, and ∠AFB intercepts arc AB. 

But since AC is the diameter, the total circumference corresponds to 180 degrees? Wait, no. The entire circle is 360 degrees. Since AC is the diameter, the semicircle from A to C is 180 degrees. So, if we consider points A, B, C, D on the circle, the positions of these points affect the arcs between them. 

Let me note down the given equations:

Measure of ∠BFC = 72°, which is the central angle for arc BC. So arc BC is 72°.

Measure of ∠AFD = 4a - 1. This angle is at F, so it's the central angle for arc AD. Therefore, arc AD measures 4a - 1 degrees.

Measure of ∠AFB = 2a - 5. That's the central angle for arc AB, so arc AB measures 2a - 5 degrees.

Also, since AC is the diameter, the arc from A to C is 180 degrees. Let me think about how the arcs relate. The points B and D are somewhere on the circle. Depending on their positions, the arcs between them could add up to the total circumference.

Wait, but perhaps we can express other arcs in terms of these variables. For instance, if we consider the entire circle, the sum of all arcs should be 360 degrees. However, without knowing where exactly B and D are placed, it's a bit tricky. Alternatively, maybe considering the arcs around the circle.

Alternatively, since AC is the diameter, the arc AC is 180 degrees. Let's think about the positions of B and D relative to A and C. Suppose moving from A to C along the circle, passing through B and D. Or maybe B and D are arranged such that arcs AB, BC, CD, DA make up the circle. But without more info, perhaps we need to find relations between the arcs.

Alternatively, since we have two expressions involving 'a', maybe we can set up equations based on the fact that the sum of certain arcs equals known quantities.

Let me try to outline the arcs:

Arc AB = 2a - 5 degrees (from ∠AFB).

Arc BC = 72 degrees (from ∠BFC).

Arc AD = 4a - 1 degrees (from ∠AFD).

But how do these arcs relate to each other?

Since AC is the diameter, the arc from A to C is 180 degrees. Let me see. Arc AB + arc BC would be part of the arc from A to C. But depending on whether B is between A and C or not. Similarly, arc AD could be going the other way around the circle. However, since the circle has 360 degrees, and AC is 180 degrees, perhaps we can find relations based on overlapping arcs.

Assuming that points A, B, C, D are arranged in order around the circle. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the order. However, since ∠AFD is mentioned, which involves points A, F, D. So D is another point on the circle. Maybe the points are arranged such that moving from A to D passes through B or something like that.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that the sum of arcs AB + BC + CD + DA equals 360 degrees. But without knowing the position of D, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, since AC is a straight line (diameter), the arc AC is 180 degrees, so the sum of arcs AB + BC would be 180 degrees if B lies between A and C. Similarly, arc AD could be split into arc AB plus arc BD or something else.

Alternatively, maybe we can consider that angle AFD is formed by points A, F, D. So, since F is the center, the angle at F between A and D is the central angle for arc AD. So arc AD is 4a - 1 degrees. Similarly, arc AB is 2a - 5 degrees. Now, if we can find another equation relating these variables.

Wait, but what's the relationship between arcs AB, BC, CD, DA? Let me think. Let's suppose that the points are ordered A, B, C, D around the circle. Then, arc AB + arc BC + arc CD + arc DA = 360 degrees. But since AC is the diameter, arc AC is 180 degrees, so arc AB + arc BC = 180 degrees. Also, arc AD is 4a - 1. If D is positioned such that arc AD goes from A to D passing through B, then arc AD would be arc AB + arc BD. But without knowing where D is, this is unclear.

Alternatively, since we have arc AD and arc AB, maybe we can find another relation. Let me check again. We know arc BC is 72 degrees. Arc AB is 2a - 5, arc BC is 72, so if B is between A and C, then arc AB + arc BC = arc AC = 180 degrees. So substituting:

arc AB + arc BC = (2a - 5) + 72 = 180 degrees.

Therefore:

2a -5 + 72 = 180 → 2a + 67 = 180 → 2a = 113 → a = 56.5

Then, substituting back into the expression for arc AD, which is 4a - 1:

4*(56.5) -1 = 226 -1 = 225 degrees. Wait, but arc AD being 225 degrees seems quite large. Is that possible?

Wait, but if arc AD is 225 degrees, then the central angle ∠AFD is 225 degrees. But since the entire circle is 360 degrees, an arc of 225 degrees would imply that point D is located such that when you go from A to D, it's almost three-quarters of the circle. But if AC is the diameter (180 degrees), then arc AD being 225 would suggest that D is on the opposite side of the circle from C. But maybe that's okay. However, let's check if there are contradictions here.

But before accepting that, let's verify the calculation. If arc AB is 2a -5, and arc BC is 72, adding to 180 gives us:

2a -5 + 72 = 180 → 2a = 180 - 67 = 113 → a = 56.5. That seems correct.

Then, arc AD is 4a -1 = 4*56.5 -1 = 226 -1 = 225 degrees. So that's 225 degrees. Now, what does that mean for the rest of the diagram?

But we also need to consider the position of point D. Since arc AD is 225 degrees, which is more than half the circle (which is 180). So starting at A, going counterclockwise 225 degrees would take us past C (since AC is 180 degrees) and continue towards the opposite direction. So D is located such that from A, going 225 degrees around the circle reaches D. 

But then, how does that relate to the rest of the points? Well, maybe we don't need to worry about that. Our main goal is to find the measure of ∠AFB, which is the central angle corresponding to arc AB. Wait, but we already have that arc AB is 2a -5, which we found to be 2*56.5 -5 = 113 -5 = 108 degrees. Wait, hold on! Wait, if arc AB is 2a -5, then once we found a=56.5, then arc AB is 2*56.5 -5 = 113 -5 = 108 degrees. So that would mean that ∠AFB is 108 degrees. Which is one of the options, answer B.

Wait, but let me confirm again. Because the question asks for the measure of ∠AFB, which is the central angle over arc AB. So if arc AB is 108 degrees, then ∠AFB is 108 degrees. Hence, answer B.

But let me double-check my assumption that arc AB + arc BC = 180 degrees. That's valid only if B lies between A and C on the circle. But since AC is the diameter, and the points are on the circle, unless B is on the other side, but the problem didn't specify. However, given that angle BFC is 72 degrees, which implies that B and C are on the same side of the diameter AC. Wait, if B were on the opposite side of AC from C, then arc BC would be larger than 180 degrees. But since the measure of ∠BFC is 72 degrees, which is less than 180, so that suggests that B is on the same side of AC as C. Thus, arc BC is 72 degrees, and B is between A and C. Therefore, arc AB + arc BC = arc AC = 180 degrees. So yes, that equation holds.

Thus, solving for a gives a=56.5, leading to arc AB = 108 degrees, hence ∠AFB is 108 degrees. Therefore, the answer is B.

But let me check if there are any other constraints or possibilities. For example, what if D is placed such that arc AD is 225 degrees, which would make the arc from A to D going the long way around the circle. But since we have four points on the circle, maybe there's another relation. However, the problem doesn't give more angles involving D, except ∠AFD. So maybe that's just extra info. Since the question only asks about ∠AFB, which we've solved via the above method.

Another thing to check: Are there any inconsistencies in the other angles? For example, if arc AD is 225 degrees, then the central angle ∠AFD is 225 degrees. But since the maximum possible central angle is 360 degrees, that's acceptable. Also, there's no contradiction here. So the answer should be B, 108 degrees.
