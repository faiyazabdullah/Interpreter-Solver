Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the problem gives me some geometric predicates and asks me to find the length of TQ. Let me start by breaking down the given information step by step.

First, there's a Triangle RST. Wait, but the points mentioned are R, S, T, and Q. Oh, right, because there's also a point Q involved since there's a RightAngle at Angle(R,S,Q) and Angle(T,S,Q). Hmm, so maybe Q is another point connected to S? Also, there's an altitude from S to Q in the triangle RST. Wait, the predicate says IsAltitudeOf(Line(S,Q), Triangle(R,S,T)). So Line SQ is an altitude of triangle RST. That means SQ is perpendicular to RT? Or wait, in a triangle, an altitude is a perpendicular segment from a vertex to the opposite side. But here, the altitude is from S to Q. Wait, but if it's an altitude of the triangle RST, then Q must lie on the opposite side from S. Wait, triangle RST has vertices R, S, T. So the altitude from S would go to the opposite side RT. Therefore, Q must be the foot of the altitude from S to RT. But then, the problem mentions two right angles at S: Angle(R,S,Q) and Angle(T,S,Q). Wait, that suggests that SQ is perpendicular to both SR and ST? But that can't be unless SR and ST are both perpendicular to SQ, implying that SR and ST are parallel, but that would make triangle RST have two sides perpendicular to SQ, making it a degenerate triangle? That doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something here.

Wait, let me re-examine the predicates. There are two RightAngle predicates: Angle(R,S,Q) and Angle(T,S,Q). So, angle at S between R and Q is a right angle, and angle at S between T and Q is also a right angle. That implies that both R-S-Q and T-S-Q form right angles. Which would mean that SQ is perpendicular to both SR and ST. But that would require SR and ST to be colinear, which would make R, S, T collinear, which contradicts them forming a triangle. So there must be something wrong with my interpretation.

Alternatively, perhaps Q is not on the side RT but somewhere else? Wait, but the altitude is from S to the opposite side. Wait, maybe the triangle isn't RST but another triangle? Wait, the IsAltitudeOf(Line(S,Q), Triangle(R,S,T)) suggests that the altitude is part of triangle RST. So SQ is an altitude. Therefore, Q lies on the opposite side from S, which would be RT. So SQ is perpendicular to RT. However, the right angles given are at S between R-S-Q and T-S-Q. That seems conflicting unless RT is being considered as a single line where SQ is perpendicular. Wait, if SQ is perpendicular to RT, then angles at S between R-S-Q and T-S-Q would each be right angles only if Q is such that SQ is perpendicular to RT. Wait, but how does that work?

Let me sketch this mentally. Suppose we have triangle RST with S as one vertex. The altitude from S to RT meets RT at Q. Then SQ is perpendicular to RT. Now, the angles at S between R-S-Q and T-S-Q would not necessarily be right angles unless... Wait, no. Because SQ is perpendicular to RT, but R and T are endpoints of RT. So, if you look at angle RSQ and TSQ, those angles are at point S. Wait, no. Wait, angle RSQ would be at point S between R and Q. But if SQ is perpendicular to RT, then angle between SR and SQ would depend on the position of Q. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to consider coordinates.

Let me assign coordinates to the points to make it clearer. Let me place point S at the origin (0,0). Since there are right angles at S involving Q, maybe SQ is along one axis. Let's assume that SQ is along the y-axis. Then, since there's a right angle at S between R and Q, that would imply that SR is horizontal. Similarly, the other right angle at S between T and Q would imply that ST is vertical? Wait, no. If SQ is along the y-axis, then for angle R-S-Q to be a right angle, SR must be horizontal. For example, if Q is on the y-axis, then SR could be along the x-axis. Similarly, ST would need to be along the same line as SQ? No, because the second right angle is Angle(T,S,Q), which would mean that ST is perpendicular to SQ. Wait, if SQ is the y-axis, then ST must be along the x-axis? But then both SR and ST would be along the x-axis, making R and T both on the x-axis. Then RT would be a straight line along the x-axis, and SQ is the altitude from S to RT, which would just be the vertical line from S(0,0) to Q on the x-axis. Wait, but in that case, Q would be the foot of the altitude, which is on RT. But then, the right angles at S between R-S-Q and T-S-Q would mean that SR is horizontal (along x-axis) and SQ is vertical. So angle between SR (x-axis) and SQ (y-axis) is 90 degrees. Similarly, angle between ST (which would also be along x-axis?) and SQ (y-axis) would also be 90 degrees. But if ST is along x-axis, then T is on x-axis. So, points R and T are on x-axis, S is at (0,0), and Q is the foot of the altitude from S to RT, which is the x-axis. Hence, Q would be the projection of S onto x-axis, which is the origin itself? Wait, but then Q would coincide with S? That can't be. Wait, that suggests that my coordinate assumption is leading to inconsistency. 

Hmm, maybe I need to adjust. Let me think again. If SQ is the altitude from S to RT, then Q lies on RT. And SQ is perpendicular to RT. Also, there are two right angles at S: between R-S-Q and T-S-Q. Wait, that would mean that both SR and ST are perpendicular to SQ. But if SQ is perpendicular to RT, then SR and ST would both be perpendicular to SQ, implying that SR and ST are parallel to each other. But in a triangle, two sides cannot be parallel unless the triangle is degenerate. Therefore, this seems impossible. Unless the triangle is degenerate, but that's not allowed. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, my initial understanding must be incorrect.

Wait, maybe the right angles are not referring to the angles formed by the sides of the triangle. Let me check the original predicates again: RightAngle(Angle(R,S,Q)) and RightAngle(Angle(T,S,Q)). So, angle at S between R and Q is a right angle, and angle at S between T and Q is a right angle. That would mean that SQ is perpendicular to both SR and ST. Therefore, vectors SR and ST are both perpendicular to SQ. Hence, SR and ST are parallel to each other. But in a triangle, two sides can't be parallel unless they're the same line, which would make the triangle degenerate. So this suggests that the triangle RST is actually a straight line, which contradicts the existence of a triangle. Therefore, there must be a different interpretation.

Wait, perhaps Q is not on RT but on another side? Wait, the altitude is from S to the opposite side. In triangle RST, the altitude from S should go to the opposite side RT. So Q is on RT. But then, if SQ is perpendicular to RT, then angles at S between R-S-Q and T-S-Q would be angles between SR and SQ, and between ST and SQ. If SQ is perpendicular to RT, then SR and ST are not necessarily perpendicular to SQ. Wait, unless RT is a straight line and SQ is perpendicular to it, but SR and ST are parts of the triangle. Wait, for example, suppose RT is horizontal, SQ is vertical. Then, SR is from S to R, which is somewhere above or below the line RT. So the angle between SR and SQ would be determined by the slope of SR. Similarly for ST. So unless SR and ST are arranged such that both are perpendicular to SQ, which would require them to be parallel to each other. But again, that leads us back to the earlier contradiction.

This suggests that there's a mistake in my understanding. Let me re-express the problem. Given the predicates:

- Triangle(R,S,T): So points R, S, T form a triangle.

- Length of RS is 7 units, since Equals(LengthOf(Line(R,S)),7).

- Length of TS is also 7 units, since Equals(LengthOf(Line(T,S)),7). So RS = TS = 7. So triangle RST has two sides equal: RS and TS. Therefore, it's an isoceles triangle with base RT and equal sides RS and TS.

- RightAngle(Angle(R,S,Q)): So angle at S between R and Q is a right angle.

- RightAngle(Angle(T,S,Q)): Angle at S between T and Q is also a right angle.

So, these two right angles at S suggest that SQ is perpendicular to both SR and ST. Which would imply that SR and ST are both perpendicular to SQ. Therefore, SR and ST are parallel. But since RS and TS are both equal in length, this would mean that the triangle RST has two sides perpendicular to the same line, hence parallel, making it impossible unless the third side is zero-length. This seems like a contradiction. Therefore, there must be a misinterpretation.

Wait, maybe Q is not a point on the plane of the triangle RST? Or perhaps Q is not on RT but somewhere else. But the altitude from S is to the triangle RST, so Q must lie on RT. Alternatively, perhaps the altitude is not from S to RT but to another side? Wait, in triangle RST, the altitude from S would be to the opposite side, which is RT. So Q must be on RT.

But then, having two right angles at S between R-S-Q and T-S-Q implies that SQ is perpendicular to both SR and ST. So, if SQ is perpendicular to both SR and ST, then SR and ST are parallel. But in triangle RST, SR and ST meet at S, so they can't be parallel. Therefore, this seems contradictory. Therefore, there's a paradox here. How can both angles at S be right angles?

Wait, maybe the problem involves three-dimensional geometry? But the problem mentions a triangle, so likely planar. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe Q is not on the triangle's plane? Not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the right angles are not at the same point? Wait, no, both angles are at S. So the problem is inconsistent? Or maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the predicates.

Wait, the IsAltitudeOf(Line(S,Q), Triangle(R,S,T)) predicate. So SQ is an altitude of triangle RST. Therefore, SQ is perpendicular to RT. So SQ ⊥ RT. Also, the two right angles at S imply that SQ is perpendicular to both SR and ST. Therefore, RT is parallel to both SR and ST, which would mean that RT is parallel to itself, which is trivial, but SR and ST are sides meeting at S. So if SR and ST are both perpendicular to SQ, then they are parallel. Hence, in triangle RST, sides SR and ST are parallel. But in a triangle, two sides cannot be parallel unless the triangle is degenerate. Thus, this suggests that the triangle RST is degenerate, which contradicts the existence of a triangle. Therefore, there must be a miscalculation or misinterpretation.

Wait, maybe the right angles are not in the same plane? Like, in 3D space? But the problem refers to a triangle, so probably planar. 

Alternatively, maybe the right angles are not between the segments but something else. Wait, the angle at S between R and Q is a right angle. So, that would mean that angle R-S-Q is 90 degrees. Similarly for angle T-S-Q. So, if we imagine point Q such that SQ forms two right angles at S with SR and ST. That would mean that SQ is perpendicular to both SR and ST. Hence, SR and ST are both perpendicular to SQ. Hence, SR || ST. Which again implies that triangle RST is degenerate. But this is impossible. So either there's an error in the problem, or I'm missing something.

Wait, but the problem states that IsAltitudeOf(Line(S,Q), Triangle(R,S,T)). So SQ is an altitude, which implies that SQ is perpendicular to RT. But if SQ is perpendicular to RT, and also perpendicular to both SR and ST, then RT must be parallel to SR and ST. But since SR and ST are sides of the triangle, this is only possible if the triangle is degenerate. Hence, contradiction. 

Perhaps the key is that the triangle RST is not a regular triangle, but with certain properties. Let me try to proceed despite the apparent contradiction. Let's suppose that even though it's a contradiction, we can use the given data.

Given that RS = TS = 7, and triangle RST has an altitude from S to RT, which is SQ. Also, angles at S between R-S-Q and T-S-Q are right angles. Let me try to compute lengths.

Since SQ is the altitude from S to RT, then the length of SQ can be found using area formula. Also, since RS = TS = 7, triangle RST is isoceles with legs RS=TS=7, base RT. The altitude from S divides RT into two equal parts if the triangle is isoceles. Wait, but in this case, since SQ is the altitude, and if the triangle is isoceles with RS=TS, then yes, the altitude from S should bisect RT. So Q is the midpoint of RT. But then, if Q is the midpoint of RT, and SQ is the altitude, then in the isoceles triangle, SQ is also the median and angle bisector.

But according to the given, angles at S between R-S-Q and T-S-Q are right angles. Wait, if SQ is the altitude, then angle between SR and SQ would be some angle, not necessarily right. But according to the problem, it is a right angle. So this suggests that in this scenario, the altitude SQ is perpendicular to both SR and ST. Which would mean that SR and ST are both perpendicular to SQ, hence parallel. But in an isoceles triangle, SR and ST are not parallel. So this is a contradiction. Therefore, there's something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about a triangle RST but about another configuration? Wait, the Triangle(R,S,T) predicate means that R, S, T form a triangle. So the triangle exists. Therefore, the problem must be consistent. Let me try to find another way.

Maybe the right angles are not referring to the standard angles of the triangle. Perhaps Q is not on RT but elsewhere. Wait, but the altitude is from S to the triangle, so it must meet RT. Alternatively, maybe the altitude is not to RT but to another side? Wait, no, in triangle RST, the altitude from S goes to the opposite side RT. 

Wait, maybe the triangle is not isoceles? Wait, but RS and TS are both 7, so it is isoceles. So RT is the base, and SQ is the altitude. So RT is divided into two equal parts by Q. So RQ = QT. 

Now, given that, if we consider angles at S between R-S-Q and T-S-Q are right angles. Let me imagine that. If SQ is the altitude, then in the isoceles triangle, SQ is perpendicular to RT. So SQ is perpendicular to RT. Now, what is the relationship between SQ and SR or ST? 

In an isoceles triangle, the altitude from the apex (S) splits the base RT into two equal parts. The angle between SR and SQ would be angle between SR and the altitude. Let me calculate that angle. Let's denote the length of RT as b, and the height SQ as h. Then, in the isoceles triangle, by Pythagoras, (b/2)^2 + h^2 = RS^2 = 49. 

Now, the angle between SR and SQ is angle between SR and the altitude. Let me consider triangle SQR. In this right triangle, hypotenuse is SR =7, one leg is SQ=h, and the other leg is RQ = b/2. So cos(angle between SR and SQ) = adjacent/hypotenuse = h /7. Similarly, sin(angle) = (b/2)/7. 

But according to the problem, this angle is 90 degrees. Wait, no, the angle at S between R and Q is supposed to be a right angle. Wait, that angle is angle R-S-Q. In triangle RST, angle at S between R and Q would be the angle between SR and SQ. But in reality, this angle is not necessarily a right angle. Unless... unless h = 0, which would collapse the triangle. 

Wait, this suggests that the only way for angle R-S-Q to be a right angle is if SQ is perpendicular to SR. But SQ is already perpendicular to RT. So if SQ is perpendicular to both RT and SR, then RT and SR are parallel. But in that case, since RT is the base of the isoceles triangle, and SR is one of the equal sides, this would mean that RT is parallel to SR. But that would imply that the triangle is degenerate. 

Therefore, this seems impossible. But the problem gives these conditions, so there must be a way to resolve it. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding about what constitutes an altitude. Maybe the altitude is not from S to RT, but from S to another side? Wait, no, the altitude from S in triangle RST must be to the opposite side, which is RT.

Wait, perhaps the altitude is not from S to RT, but from Q to another side? No, the predicate says IsAltitudeOf(Line(S,Q), Triangle(R,S,T)), meaning that Line(S,Q) is an altitude of the triangle. So SQ is the altitude.

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try assigning variables and see if equations can be solved despite contradictions.

Let me denote:

RS = TS =7.

Let’s let SQ = h (height from S to RT).

RT = b, so RQ = QT = b/2.

From Pythagoras: (b/2)^2 + h^2 = 7^2 → b²/4 + h² = 49.

Also, from the given, there are two right angles at S: angle R-S-Q and angle T-S-Q. So, in triangle SQR, angle at S is right angle. Wait, but in triangle SQR, the sides are SQ, QR, and SR. If angle at S is right, then by Pythagoras: SQ² + SR² = QR²? No, wait, if angle at S is right, then the sides around the right angle are SQ and SR, and the hypotenuse would be QR. Wait, no. Let me clarify:

If angle at S between R and Q is right, then in triangle SQR, angle at S is right. So, the triangle SQR has a right angle at S. Therefore, by Pythagoras:

SQ² + SR² = QR².

Similarly, in triangle SQT, angle at S is right, so SQ² + ST² = QT².

But since RS=TS=7, and QR=QT=b/2, we have:

For triangle SQR: h² + 7² = (b/2)² → h² + 49 = b²/4.

For triangle SQT: h² + 7² = (b/2)² → same equation.

So this gives us the same equation as before. But from the Pythagorean theorem in the main triangle, we had b²/4 + h² = 49. Wait, substituting the previous equation into this:

From the first equation: b²/4 = h² + 49.

Substituting into the main equation: (h² + 49) + h² = 49 → 2h² + 49 = 49 → 2h² = 0 → h = 0.

Which implies that the height is zero, making the triangle degenerate. This confirms the earlier contradiction. So the only solution is h=0, which is not possible for a triangle. Hence, there's no non-degenerate triangle satisfying the given conditions. But the problem states that such a triangle exists, so there must be a different interpretation.

Ah! Wait, perhaps the altitude is not from S to RT, but from Q to another side? No, the predicate says IsAltitudeOf(Line(S,Q), Triangle(R,S,T)), so Line(S,Q) is an altitude, meaning it goes from S to the opposite side. So it must be to RT.

Another possibility: Maybe the right angles are not in the triangle RST, but in another triangle? Or perhaps Q is not on RT but on another side? Wait, the altitude from S must be to the opposite side. 

Wait, perhaps the triangle is not RST but another triangle? Wait, the given Triangle(R,S,T) is the triangle, so R, S, T are its vertices. 

I'm really stuck. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the problem uses the fact that SQ is an altitude, and also creates two right angles at S. So even though it seems contradictory, perhaps there's a way to reconcile it.

Assume that SQ is an altitude, so it's perpendicular to RT. Also, the angles at S between R-S-Q and T-S-Q are right angles. So, in addition to being perpendicular to RT, SQ is also perpendicular to SR and ST? That would mean that RT is parallel to SR and ST. Which, as discussed, makes the triangle degenerate. 

However, if we ignore the contradiction and proceed mathematically, perhaps we can find values for x. The question asks for TQ. From earlier, QT = b/2. But if the height h=0, then QT = sqrt(7² - h²) = 7. Wait, but if h=0, then QT = b/2 = sqrt(49 - 0) = 7. So b/2 =7 → b=14. So RT=14. Then, QT=7. But the problem also gives expressions for the lengths of SQ: Equals(LengthOf(Line(R,Q)),x+3) and Equals(LengthOf(Line(T,Q)),2x-6). Wait, but RQ and TQ are both equal to b/2, which is 7. So RQ = TQ =7. But according to the problem, RQ is x+3 and TQ is 2x-6. So setting x+3 =7 and 2x-6=7. Solving x+3=7 gives x=4. Plugging into 2x-6: 2*4-6=8-6=2 ≠7. Contradiction. So this approach fails.

But if we set both RQ and TQ to 7, then we have two equations:

x+3 =7 → x=4

and 2x-6 =7 → x=13/2=6.5. These don't match, so no solution. Hence, contradiction.

But the problem must have a solution. Therefore, my entire approach must be wrong. Let me try a different angle.

Wait, perhaps the right angles are not referring to the angles formed by SQ with SR and ST, but with other lines. Wait, the Angle(R,S,Q) is the angle at S between R and Q. So, this would be the angle between SR and SQ. Similarly, Angle(T,S,Q) is the angle between ST and SQ. So, if both of these angles are right angles, then SQ is perpendicular to both SR and ST. Hence, SR and ST are both perpendicular to SQ. Therefore, SR and ST are parallel. Hence, in triangle RST, SR || ST. But since they meet at S, this implies that the triangle is degenerate. But the problem states it's a triangle, so this is impossible. 

Unless the triangle is in 3D space, but the problem doesn't specify that. 

Alternatively, maybe Q is not on RT but on another side. Wait, but the altitude from S must be to the opposite side, which is RT. So Q must be on RT. 

Wait, maybe the triangle is not RST but another triangle? No, the given is Triangle(R,S,T). 

This seems like a dead end. Perhaps the problem has a typo, or I'm missing a key insight. Let me try to focus on the equations given.

We have RS=7, TS=7. Also, the lengths RQ=x+3 and TQ=2x-6. Since Q is on RT, RQ + QT = RT. So:

(x+3) + (2x-6) = RT → 3x -3 = RT.

But from earlier, if we assume that the triangle is isoceles with RS=TS=7, then RT can be computed via Pythagoras if we know the height. But without knowing the height, we can't. However, from the right angles at S, we might derive relations.

Wait, if SQ is perpendicular to RT, and also to SR and ST, then as before, this implies that RT is parallel to SR and ST. Hence, RT is parallel to SR and ST, which implies that RT is parallel to itself, which is trivial. But in this case, the length of RT can be anything, but the height SQ is zero. 

But if we take the given expressions for RQ and TQ, and set their sum to RT, then:

RQ + TQ = (x+3) + (2x-6) = 3x -3 = RT.

But also, from the triangle, since RS=7 and SQ=0, then by Pythagoras, (RT/2)^2 + 0^2 = 7^2 → RT = 14. Hence, 3x-3=14 → 3x=17 → x=17/3 ≈5.666...

But then, the problem asks for TQ=2x-6. Substituting x=17/3, TQ=2*(17/3)-6 = 34/3 - 18/3 = 16/3 ≈5.333... But none of the options match this. The options are A.6, B.7, C.12, D.18. So this suggests that this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the right angles are not due to SQ being an altitude, but due to some other property. Let me try to forget about the altitude for a moment and focus on the right angles.

If angle R-S-Q and angle T-S-Q are both right angles, then SQ is perpendicular to both SR and ST. Hence, SR and ST are both perpendicular to SQ, making them parallel. Hence, the triangle RST is degenerate. But if we proceed regardless, assuming that SR and ST are parallel, then the triangle RST is a degenerate line segment RT with S somewhere off the line. But then, the altitude from S to RT would be the distance from S to RT, which is the length of SQ. 

In this degenerate case, let's say RT is a line segment, and S is a point not on RT. The altitude from S to RT is SQ, which is perpendicular to RT. Also, since SR and ST are both perpendicular to SQ, which is the altitude, then SR and ST are parallel to each other. 

In this scenario, the length of SQ can be calculated using the distances from S to R and S to T. Let's denote SQ = h. Then, since SR and ST are both perpendicular to SQ, the distance from S to R is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs h and the horizontal distance from Q to R. Similarly for T.

Let me define coordinates. Let me place Q at the origin (0,0). Since SQ is perpendicular to RT, let's align SQ along the y-axis. So Q is at (0,0), and S is at (0,h), since SQ is the altitude. Now, since SR and ST are perpendicular to SQ (the y-axis), they must be horizontal lines. So SR is horizontal, so R is at (a, h) and T is at (b, h)? Wait, no. Wait, if SR is horizontal, then R is horizontally aligned with S. Wait, S is at (0,h), and SR is horizontal, so R is at (k, h) for some k. Similarly, ST is horizontal, so T is at (m, h). But since SQ is the altitude from S to RT, and Q is the foot of the altitude, which is (0,0). So RT is the line connecting R(k,h) and T(m,h). But since Q is on RT, and Q is (0,0), which must lie on RT.

So the line RT passes through (k,h) and (m,h). Since Q(0,0) is on this line, which is horizontal at y=h. But Q is at (0,0), which has y-coordinate 0, while the line RT is at y=h. This is only possible if h=0, which brings us back to the degenerate case. Hence, no solution unless h=0.

Thus, again, this leads to a contradiction. 

But the problem must have a solution. Maybe the error is in assuming that both right angles are at S. Let me recheck the predicates: RightAngle(Angle(R,S,Q)) and RightAngle(Angle(T,S,Q)). So, angle at S between R and Q is a right angle, and angle at S between T and Q is a right angle. So, this means that SQ is perpendicular to both SR and ST. Hence, SR and ST are parallel. But in a triangle, this is only possible if the triangle is degenerate. 

But if we proceed formally, let's assume that SR and ST are parallel, and use the given lengths. Let's say that RS =7, TS=7. Since SR and ST are parallel and equal in length, the figure is a parallelogram? No, because it's a triangle. Wait, but in a triangle, if two sides are parallel, it's degenerate. 

But let's try to model it as a degenerate triangle. Let me imagine points R and T on a line, and S somewhere off the line. The altitude from S to RT is SQ, which is perpendicular to RT. Also, since SR and ST are parallel to SQ (wait, no, SR and ST are parallel to each other, not to SQ). 

Wait, if SR and ST are parallel, then the vector from S to R is parallel to the vector from S to T. So, R - S is parallel to T - S. Hence, vectors SR and ST are parallel. Which implies that points R, S, T are colinear? No, because if vectors SR and ST are parallel, then R - S = k(T - S) for some scalar k. This would mean that R and T are on the same line through S, making the triangle degenerate. 

Thus, in this case, the triangle RST is degenerate, with S lying on RT. But then, the altitude from S to RT would be zero length, as S is on RT. Hence, SQ is zero, which contradicts the given lengths of RQ and TQ. 

But the problem gives expressions for RQ and TQ as x+3 and 2x-6. If SQ is zero, then Q coincides with S, so RQ = RS =7, and TQ = TS=7. Setting x+3=7 and 2x-6=7, we get x=4 and x=6.5, which is inconsistent. Hence, no solution.

This suggests that the problem is flawed. But since it's a multiple-choice question, there must be a correct answer among the options. Let me try to ignore the contradictions and see if there's a way to connect the given expressions for RQ and TQ.

We have RQ = x+3 and TQ = 2x-6. Since Q is on RT, RQ + TQ = RT. So:

x + 3 + 2x - 6 = RT → 3x - 3 = RT.

Also, from the triangle RST, since RS = TS =7, and if we assume it's isoceles, then RT can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem if we know the height. Let's call the height h. Then, (RT/2)^2 + h^2 = 7^2.

But from the right angles at S, if we assume that SQ is the altitude h, and that it creates right angles at S, then we might relate h to RQ and TQ. Wait, if angle at S between R and Q is right, then in triangle SQR, which is right-angled at S, we have:

SR² = SQ² + RQ² → 7² = h² + (x+3)^2.

Similarly, for triangle SQT, which is right-angled at S:

TS² = SQ² + TQ² → 7² = h² + (2x-6)^2.

So now we have two equations:

1. 49 = h² + (x+3)^2

2. 49 = h² + (2x-6)^2

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2:

0 = (2x-6)^2 - (x+3)^2

Expand both squares:

(4x² -24x +36) - (x² +6x +9) = 0

Simplify:

4x² -24x +36 -x² -6x -9 = 0

Combine like terms:

3x² -30x +27 = 0

Divide by 3:

x² -10x +9 = 0

Factor:

(x-1)(x-9)=0 → x=1 or x=9.

Now, check these solutions.

First, x=1:

Then, RQ = 1+3=4, TQ=2*1-6=-4. Length can't be negative, so discard x=1.

Next, x=9:

RQ=9+3=12, TQ=2*9-6=12. Both positive. So TQ=12, which is option C.

But wait, why did this work? Because we assumed that triangles SQR and SQT are right-angled at S, which led to these equations. Even though earlier reasoning suggested contradictions, this algebraic approach yields a valid solution. So perhaps the problem assumes that the right angles are in these triangles, despite the earlier geometric contradictions. 

Let me verify if this works with the altitude. From the equations:

For x=9, RQ=12, TQ=12. So RT=RQ+TQ=24. Then, from the Pythagorean theorem in the main triangle:

(RT/2)^2 + h² = 7^2 → (12)^2 + h² = 49 → 144 + h² = 49 → h² = -97. Which is impossible. So this suggests that the assumption is invalid, but mathematically, the equations gave us x=9, leading to TQ=12, which is option C. 

But why does this happen? It appears that even though the geometric assumptions lead to a contradiction, the algebraic manipulation based on the given predicates gives a valid answer. Perhaps the problem assumes that the right angles exist, and thus the equations are set up to give x=9, leading to TQ=12. Despite the geometric inconsistency, this might be the intended solution.

Hence, the answer is C. 12.
