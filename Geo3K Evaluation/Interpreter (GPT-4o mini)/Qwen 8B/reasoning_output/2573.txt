Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, the question is asking for the measure of angle 1, and there are some given predicates. Let me start by breaking down the information provided.

First, the given predicates are:

1. RightAngle(Angle(D, B, C)) – This means that angle at point B formed by points D, B, C is a right angle. So, ∠DBA is 90 degrees? Wait, no, Angle(D, B, C) would be the angle at point B between points D and C. So, it's ∠DBC being a right angle.

2. Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B, A, D)), 157) – So, the measure of angle at point A formed by points B, A, D is 157 degrees. That is, ∠BAD = 157°.

Then there are other angles mentioned:

3. Angle(H, C, F) – So, angle at point C between H and F, so ∠HCF.

4. Angle(E, L, H) – Angle at point L between E and H, ∠ELH.

5. Angle(A, I, D) – Angle at point I between A and D, ∠AID.

6. Angle(G, B, A) – Angle at point B between G and A, ∠GBA.

Wait, but how do these relate to each other? The question is about finding m∠1. But where is angle 1 located? Since the problem mentions "the figure," but there's no figure provided here. Hmm, that complicates things. Maybe angle 1 refers to one of these angles listed?

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is referring to another angle that's part of the diagram constructed from these given angles. Without seeing the figure, I need to infer based on standard geometric configurations.

Let me list all the given angles again:

- ∠DBC is a right angle (90°).
- ∠BAD = 157°.
- ∠HCF, ∠ELH, ∠AID, ∠GBA. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging. However, perhaps there are relationships between these angles. For example, since ∠BAD is 157°, and ∠DBC is 90°, maybe they form parts of larger structures like triangles or intersecting lines.

Another thought: In such problems, sometimes angles are adjacent or supplementary. For instance, if two angles form a linear pair, their measures add up to 180°. Also, vertical angles are equal, corresponding angles if lines are parallel, etc.

Given that ∠BAD is 157°, which is quite large—almost a straight line. If we consider that ∠BAD is part of a triangle or a quadrilateral, maybe other angles can be found using the sum of angles in a polygon.

Also, since ∠DBC is a right angle (90°), perhaps there are right triangles involved. For example, if points D, B, C form a right angle, then triangle DBC is a right triangle. But how does that connect to the rest?

Wait, the question asks for m∠1. Maybe angle 1 is one of the angles mentioned in the predicates? Or perhaps it's an angle formed by the intersection of certain lines? For example, if there's a transversal cutting through lines, creating various angles.

Alternatively, considering that ∠BAD is 157°, and ∠GBA is another angle. If those two angles share a common side, maybe BA, then they could be adjacent. For example, if ∠GBA and ∠BAD are adjacent, forming a larger angle. But ∠GBA is at point B, between G and A. If BA is a side, then maybe ∠GBA and ∠ABC (if C is another point) could be related.

Wait, but the first given is ∠DBC is a right angle. So points D, B, C are arranged such that at point B, the angle between D and C is 90°. Then, ∠BAD is at point A, between B and D. So, points B, A, D form an angle of 157°. So, if we imagine points A, B, D connected, with B connected to D and A. And point C connected to B, making a right angle at B.

Perhaps there's a triangle involving points A, B, D, and C? Not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe there are several triangles connected through these points. For example, triangle ABD with angle at A being 157°, and triangle DBC with a right angle at B.

If that's the case, then in triangle ABD, the angles would sum to 180°. Wait, but we know angle BAD is 157°, so the other two angles at A and D? Wait, no. In triangle ABD, the vertices are A, B, D. The angles would be at each vertex. But angle at A is 157°, so the sum of angles at B and D in triangle ABD would be 180 - 157 = 23°. But unless we have more info, we can't determine individual angles.

However, there's also the right angle at B in ∠DBC. So, if point C is connected to B, forming BC, and BD forms part of the triangle ABD. So, BC is perpendicular to BD. Therefore, angle between BC and BD is 90°, which could imply that BC is perpendicular to BD.

So, if BD is a side of triangle ABD, and BC is perpendicular to BD, then perhaps there's a relationship between triangles ABC and ABD?

Alternatively, maybe we need to find some other angles using the given ones. Let's think about the other angles mentioned: ∠AID, ∠ELH, ∠HCF, ∠GBA. These seem arbitrary unless they are part of a larger structure. 

Since the question is asking for m∠1, which isn't specified, but given that the options are A. 90, B. 113, C. 123, D. 157. The given angle measures are 157 and 90. So, maybe angle 1 is supplementary to 157°, giving 23°, but that's not among the options. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a triangle with 90° and 157°, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe there's a triangle where 157° is one angle, and another angle is 90°, leading to the third angle being 180 - 157 - 90 = negative, which doesn't make sense. So that's impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps the 157° angle is part of a straight line with another angle, so that 157 + x = 180 → x=23. Again, not matching options.

Wait, but maybe the 157° is an exterior angle. For example, in a triangle, an exterior angle equals the sum of the remote interior angles. Suppose angle BAD is an exterior angle, then it would be equal to the sum of two opposite interior angles. But without knowing which angles those are, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, if there's a transversal cutting through parallel lines, creating alternate interior angles, corresponding angles, etc. But again, without knowing which lines are parallel, it's difficult.

Wait, another possibility: The given ∠BAD = 157°, and ∠DBC = 90°. Perhaps there's a way to relate these angles through some geometric construction. For example, if lines AD and BC intersect at some point, forming vertical angles or something else.

Alternatively, think about the sum of angles around a point. If multiple angles meet at a point, their measures add up to 360°. But again, without knowing which angles are around which point, it's tricky.

Wait, let me re-examine the given predicates again. There's also Angle(A, I, D), which is ∠AID. So, that's an angle at point I between A and D. Similarly, Angle(G, B, A) is ∠GBA. So, these angles may be part of different triangles or lines.

This is getting confusing without a diagram. Maybe I should look for patterns or see if any of the answer choices can be derived from the given data.

For example, if angle 1 is part of a triangle with angles adding up to 180°, and if we can find two angles, we can subtract from 180. But how?

Wait, the only numerical value given directly is 157° for ∠BAD. Another is the right angle (90°). Are there any other known angles?

Suppose that ∠BAD is 157°, and ∠ABD is part of triangle ABD. If ∠ABD is part of a right angle at B because of ∠DBC being 90°, then maybe ∠ABD is complementary to another angle?

Wait, suppose that ∠ABD and ∠CBD form the right angle at B. Because ∠DBC is 90°, which is angle at B between D and C. So, if points A, B, D are connected, and point C is connected to B, then ∠ABD is part of the angle at B. Wait, but ∠DBC is the angle between D and C at B, so that's separate from ∠ABD. Unless points A, B, C, D are arranged in a particular way.

Let me try to sketch mentally. Let's assume points D and C are on either side of B, forming a right angle. So, BD and BC are perpendicular. Now, point A is somewhere such that angle BAD is 157°. So, if we imagine point A connected to B and D, forming ∠BAD at A. 

In this scenario, triangle ABD has angle at A of 157°, and at B, maybe some angle. If BD and BC are perpendicular, then perhaps line BC is extending from B, and line BD is another line. So, maybe line AB connects to point A, and line AD connects to D. 

Now, if we consider triangle ABD, the sum of its internal angles is 180°. We know angle at A is 157°, so the sum of angles at B and D is 180 - 157 = 23°. But we don't know which is which. However, if there's a right angle at B related to ∠DBC, which is 90°, then maybe angle at B in triangle ABD is part of that 90°?

Wait, if ∠DBC is 90°, then angle between DB and BC is 90°. But in triangle ABD, angle at B is between A and D. So, unless line BC is aligned with line BA or something, which we don't know. It's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe angle at B in triangle ABD is 90°, making it a right triangle. But that would mean ∠ABD is 90°, making the remaining angle at D equal to 23° - 90°, which isn't possible. So that can't be.

Hmm, this is really challenging without the diagram. Maybe angle 1 is referring to ∠GBA or another angle mentioned in the predicates. Let's check the answer choices: 90, 113, 123, 157. The given angles are 157 and 90. So, maybe angle 1 is one of these, but 157 is already given as ∠BAD, so likely not. But 90 is given as a right angle.

Wait, the question says "Find m∠1 in the figure." If angle 1 is the right angle, then answer A. But why would they give all those other angles then? Or maybe angle 1 is another angle derived from the given ones.

Wait, let's think about supplementary angles. If ∠BAD is 157°, then the adjacent angle to it along line AD would be 180 - 157 = 23°. But again, not helpful.

Alternatively, if there's a triangle where two angles are known, and the third is needed. For example, if angle 1 is part of a triangle with angles 90° and 157°, but that's impossible.

Wait, maybe there's a triangle with angles 90° and some other angle, and angle 1 is the third. But unless we can find that missing angle.

Alternatively, think about the sum of angles around a point. For example, if angle 1 is at a point where several angles meet. But without knowing which point, it's hard.

Wait, another idea: The given angle ∠BAD is 157°, which is very close to a straight angle (180°). So, maybe it's a reflex angle? No, usually in geometry, angles are considered as less than 180° unless stated otherwise. So ∠BAD is 157°, which is obtuse.

If we consider that ∠BAD and ∠ABD are adjacent, forming a straight line, but that would require them to sum to 180°, so ∠ABD would be 180 - 157 = 23°. But then, if ∠ABD is 23°, and there's a right angle at B (∠DBC = 90°), then maybe ∠ABD and ∠DBC form a larger angle at B. Wait, if ∠ABD is 23°, and ∠DBC is 90°, then the total angle at B would be 23 + 90 = 113°, which is one of the answer choices! So, maybe angle 1 is 113°, which would be option B.

But how does that fit together? Let me elaborate:

Assume that at point B, there are two angles: one between A and D (∠ABD) and one between D and C (∠DBC). The sum of these two angles would be the total angle at point B. If ∠ABD is 23°, and ∠DBC is 90°, then the total angle at B would be 23 + 90 = 113°. If angle 1 refers to this total angle at B, then m∠1 would be 113°, which is option B.

But wait, how did we get ∠ABD as 23°? From assuming that ∠BAD (which is at point A) and ∠ABD (at point B) are supplementary. That would be true if points A, B, D are colinear with D and A on opposite sides of B. But that's only if ∠BAD is a straight line, which it's not—it's 157°, which suggests that point D is not on the extension of AB. So that assumption might be incorrect.

Wait, but ∠BAD is at point A, between B and D. So, the angle at A, not at B. So, my earlier assumption was wrong. The angle at A is 157°, which is ∠BAD. So, that implies that at point A, the angle between BA and DA is 157°. So, BA and DA are two rays forming an angle of 157° at point A.

Now, if we consider triangle ABD, with angle at A being 157°, then the other two angles at B and D must sum to 23°, as before. But unless we have more info about the triangle, we can't tell which is which.

However, there's another given: ∠DBC is a right angle. So, at point B, between D and C, the angle is 90°. So, if we can relate this to the triangle ABD.

If we imagine that line BC is perpendicular to BD, then in triangle ABD, BD is one side, and BC is another line from B. So, maybe triangle BCD is a right triangle, but not sure.

Alternatively, if we consider that at point B, there are two angles: one from triangle ABD (∠ABD) and another from the right angle (∠DBC). So, the total angle at point B would be ∠ABD + ∠DBC = ∠ABD + 90°. But the total angle around point B depends on the configuration. If point C is on the same side as A relative to BD, then the total angle might be different.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's still ambiguous. However, if we assume that ∠ABD and ∠DBC are adjacent, forming a larger angle at B, then their sum would be the total angle at B. If that total angle is somehow related to other parts of the diagram, maybe it's angle 1.

Alternatively, if angle 1 is the supplement of ∠BAD, which is 180 - 157 = 23°, but that's not an option. Or if angle 1 is part of a triangle where other angles are known.

Wait, going back to the earlier idea: if in triangle ABD, angle at A is 157°, and if angle at B is 90°, then angle at D would be 180 - 157 - 90 = -67°, which is impossible. So that can't be.

But if angle at B is not 90°, but instead, the right angle is elsewhere. Like, if ∠DBC is 90°, and ∠ABD is some other value.

Wait, maybe there's a triangle involving points A, B, C. If we consider triangle ABC, but without knowing where point C is, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, if we think about the fact that ∠BAD is 157°, and there's a right angle at B, maybe there's a way to use the Law of Sines or Cosines in triangle ABD. But without side lengths, it's not directly applicable.

Wait, here's another angle: the given angle ∠GBA. If ∠GBA is part of a triangle or a line, maybe it relates to other angles. For example, if GB is a line extending from B, forming ∠GBA, which might be related to the right angle at B.

But again, without more info, it's tough.

Let me revisit the possibility that the total angle at point B is 113°, which is option B. How could that happen? If ∠ABD is 23° and ∠DBC is 90°, totaling 113°, which would be the angle between BA and BC. If angle 1 is that angle, then answer B.

To justify this, we'd need to show that ∠ABD is 23°. How? Well, if ∠BAD is 157°, and if we can find that ∠ABD is supplementary to it, but that requires that points D, A, and some other point are in a straight line.

Wait, another approach: In triangle ABD, the sum of angles is 180°. We know angle at A is 157°, so angles at B and D sum to 23°. If one of those angles is 90°, then the other would be -67°, which is impossible. Hence, neither angle at B nor D is 90°. So, that's not possible.

But ∠DBC is 90°, which is at point B between D and C. So, if line BC is forming a right angle with BD, then maybe ∠ABD is part of that. Let me think: At point B, there's angle between D and C, which is 90°, and angle between A and D, which is ∠ABD. If those two angles are adjacent, then the total angle at B would be ∠ABD + 90°. But what's that total angle?

If the total angle at B is, say, 113°, then ∠ABD would be 23°, which would make sense. So, if angle 1 refers to the total angle at B, which is ∠ABD + ∠DBC = 23 + 90 = 113°, then answer B.

But how do we know that the total angle at B is 113°? It depends on whether the lines BA and BC form that angle. If angle 1 is the angle between BA and BC at point B, then yes, it would be 113°. 

So, putting it all together: 

- ∠BAD = 157° (given)
- In triangle ABD, angles sum to 180°, so angles at B and D sum to 23°
- If ∠ABD is one of those angles, and there's a right angle at B (∠DBC = 90°), then ∠ABD + ∠DBC = total angle at B, which would be 113° if ∠ABD is 23°.

Therefore, if angle 1 refers to the total angle at B between BA and BC, then m∠1 is 113°, which is option B.

That seems plausible. Given that the answer choices include 113, and the logic follows from combining the given angles, this is likely the intended solution.
