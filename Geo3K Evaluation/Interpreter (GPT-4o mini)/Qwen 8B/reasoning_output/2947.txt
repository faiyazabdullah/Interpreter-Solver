Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, and C. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

First, there's a right angle at Angle(A,C,B). Wait, that means the angle at point C between points A and B is a right angle. So triangle ACB is a right triangle with the right angle at C. Then, they say that the measure of angle CAB is 45 degrees. Wait, angle CAB would be the angle at point A between points C and B. Hmm, so in triangle ABC, angle at A is 45 degrees, angle at C is 90 degrees. That means the third angle at B should be 180 - 90 - 45 = 45 degrees. So triangle ABC has angles 45°, 45°, 90°, making it an isosceles right triangle? Wait, but wait—if angles at A and B are both 45°, then sides opposite those angles should be equal. But hold on, the legs of the right triangle would be AC and BC, since the right angle is at C. Wait, but if angles at A and B are both 45°, then the legs AC and BC would be equal in length?

Wait, but looking at the given lengths: Length of Line(C,A) is 18√3, and Length of Line(B,C) is also 18√3. So AC and BC are both 18√3. Therefore, triangle ABC is an isosceles right triangle with legs AC and BC each being 18√3. Then AB would be the hypotenuse. In a right triangle, hypotenuse squared equals sum of squares of legs. So AB² = (18√3)² + (18√3)². Let me compute that.

Calculating (18√3)^2 first. 18 squared is 324, multiplied by (√3)^2 which is 3, so 324*3=972. So each leg squared is 972. Adding them together gives 972 + 972 = 1944. Then AB is sqrt(1944). Simplify sqrt(1944). Let's factor 1944. Dividing by 4: 1944 ÷ 4 = 486. So sqrt(4*486)=2*sqrt(486). Now, 486 factors further: divide by 9: 486 ÷ 9 = 54. So sqrt(9*54) = 3*sqrt(54). Then sqrt(54) is sqrt(9*6)=3√6. So altogether, AB = 2*3*sqrt(54)? Wait, maybe I messed up here.

Let me redo the simplification. Original AB² is 1944. Let's find sqrt(1944). Break down 1944 into prime factors. Well, 1944 divided by 2 is 972, again by 2 is 486, again by 2 is 243. So 2^3 * 243. And 243 is 3^5. So total factors: 2³ × 3⁵. Then sqrt(2³×3⁵) = 2^(1.5) × 3^(2.5) = 2^(1+0.5) × 3^(2+0.5) = 2×√2 × 3² × √3 = 2×9 × √(2×3) = 18√6. So AB is 18√6. Which would make x equal to 18√6. Looking at the options, that's choice B. 

But wait, let me check again. Because if the triangle is a right triangle with legs of 18√3, then hypotenuse is 18√3 * sqrt(2), which is 18√6. Yes, because hypotenuse = leg * sqrt(2). So yes, that gives AB = 18√6. Therefore, the answer should be B. 

But wait, let me confirm once more. Given that angle at C is right angle, angles at A and B are 45°, making it an isosceles right triangle. Therefore, legs AC and BC are equal. Given that both AC and BC are 18√3, so hypotenuse AB is indeed 18√3 * sqrt(2) = 18√6. So x is 18√6. Hence, answer B.
