MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, we have two triangles, triangle JKL and triangle WYZ, and they're similar. The question is asking for the value of x. Let me start by recalling what similarity means in triangles. Similar triangles have corresponding angles equal and corresponding sides in proportion. 

First, I need to note down all the given information. For triangle JKL, there are some angle measures mentioned. Specifically, the measure of angle at K, which is angle JKL, is given as 4x - 13. Then, another angle, angle JKL? Wait, wait. Wait, the first predicate says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(K, J, L)), 4x - 13). Hmm, the notation here might be confusing. In standard terms, Angle(K, J, L) would mean the angle at point J, formed by points K, J, L. Wait, no—wait, in angle notation, the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(K, J, L) would actually be the angle at point J between points K and L. Wait, but that seems odd because usually it's written as Angle(J, K, L) for the angle at J. Maybe there's a typo here? Or perhaps the order is different. Alternatively, maybe the first argument is the vertex. Let me think again. 

Wait, the standard way to denote an angle is with three points where the middle one is the vertex. So Angle(K, J, L) would be the angle at point J between points K and L. But that's non-standard because normally it's Angle(J, K, L), which is the angle at J between segments JK and JL. So maybe there's a mistake in the predicate? Or perhaps the user intended something else. Wait, looking back at the problem statement: the first angle is MeasureOf(Angle(K, J, L)), so that's angle at J, with sides KJ and JL. Then the second angle is MeasureOf(Angle(J, K, L)), which would be angle at K, since the middle letter is K. Wait, no—if it's Angle(J, K, L), then the vertex is K, so that's the angle at K between points J and L. 

So, for triangle JKL, the angles are: 
At vertex J: angle KJL (or Angle(K, J, L)) has measure 4x -13. 
Then, the other angle mentioned is MeasureOf(Angle(J, K, L)) = y. That angle would be at vertex K, between J and L. So angle at K is y. 

Then, for triangle WZY, which is triangle WZ Y. Wait, the Triangle(W,Z,Y) implies the vertices are W, Z, Y. Then, the angles given are: MeasureOf(Angle(Z, W, Y)) equals 71 degrees. Let's parse that. Angle(Z, W, Y) would be the angle at W, between Z and Y. So that's angle at W. Also, MeasureOf(Angle(W, Z, Y)) equals 44 degrees. That angle is at Z, between W and Y. So angle at Z is 44 degrees. 

Now, the main thing is that triangles JKL and WYZ are similar. Wait, the problem states triangle JKL ~ triangle WYZ. Wait, the order matters in similarity. So if triangle JKL ~ triangle WYZ, that means the correspondence is J corresponds to W, K corresponds to Y, and L corresponds to Z. Because similarity notation is in the order of the letters. So angle J corresponds to angle W, angle K corresponds to angle Y, angle L corresponds to angle Z. 

Therefore, the angles in triangle JKL correspond to angles in triangle WYZ as follows: 
Angle J (which was given as 4x -13) corresponds to angle W (which is 71 degrees). 
Angle K (which is y) corresponds to angle Y (which is 44 degrees). 
Angle L corresponds to angle Z. 

But wait, in triangle WYZ, the angles given are angle at W (measure 71°) and angle at Z (measure 44°). Wait, the second angle mentioned for triangle WYZ is MeasureOf(Angle(W, Z, Y)) which is 44°. So that's angle at Z. Therefore, angle at Z is 44°, angle at W is 71°, so the third angle at Y would be... Well, sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, so angle at Y would be 180 - 71 - 44 = 65°. 

So in triangle WYZ, angles are: at W: 71°, at Z: 44°, at Y: 65°. 

Since triangles JKL and WYZ are similar, their angles must be equal in measure. Therefore, the angles of triangle JKL must be 71°, 44°, and 65°, but in some order depending on the correspondence. 

Wait, but earlier, we had in triangle JKL: angle at J is 4x -13, angle at K is y, and angle at L. Since the correspondence is J→W, K→Y, L→Z. So angle J (in JKL) corresponds to angle W (in WYZ), which is 71°. Therefore, angle J (which is 4x -13) must equal 71°. 

Alternatively, could there be another correspondence? Wait, the similarity is stated as triangle JKL ~ triangle WYZ. So the order is J-K-L corresponds to W-Y-Z. So angle J corresponds to angle W, angle K corresponds to angle Y, angle L corresponds to angle Z. 

Thus, angle J (from JKL) corresponds to angle W (from WYZ). So angle J = angle W = 71°, angle K corresponds to angle Y, which is 44°, and angle L corresponds to angle Z, which is 44°? Wait, no. Wait, in triangle WYZ, angle at Z is 44°, so angle L (from JKL) corresponds to angle Z (from WYZ), so angle L is 44°. 

Wait, but in triangle WYZ, the angles are at W: 71°, at Y: 65°, at Z: 44°. So the angles in triangle JKL should be the same as those in triangle WYZ. So angle J (of JKL) = angle W (of WYZ) = 71°, angle K (of JKL) = angle Y (of WYZ) = 65°, and angle L (of JKL) = angle Z (of WYZ) = 44°. Wait, but the given info for triangle WYZ is that angle at Z (which is part of triangle WYZ) is 44°, so angle L in triangle JKL is 44°. 

Wait, but in triangle JKL, we have angle J is 4x -13, angle K is y, and angle L is ... Well, the third angle. Let me check the angles again. 

In triangle JKL, the angles are: 
angle at J: 4x -13 (given)
angle at K: y (given)
angle at L: ?

Since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, so (4x -13) + y + angle_L = 180. 

But according to the similarity, angle_J corresponds to angle_W (which is 71°), angle_K corresponds to angle_Y (which is 65°?), and angle_L corresponds to angle_Z (which is 44°). 

Wait, earlier calculation for triangle WYZ: angles at W=71°, Z=44°, so angle at Y is 180 - 71 -44 = 65°. Therefore, angle at Y is 65°, so angle K in triangle JKL (since K corresponds to Y) is 65°, so y = 65. 

And angle_L corresponds to angle_Z (44°), so angle_L = 44°. 

So putting that together, in triangle JKL, the angles are: 
at J: 4x -13 = 71°, because angle J corresponds to angle W (71°)
at K: y = 65°
at L: 44°

So then, from angle at J: 4x -13 = 71. Solving for x: 4x = 71 +13 → 4x = 84 → x = 21. 

So x is 21, which is answer choice B. 

Let me double-check. 

Given that triangle JKL ~ triangle WYZ, so their angles are equal. So angle J (JKL) corresponds to angle W (WYZ). So angle J is 71°, which is given as 4x -13. Solve 4x -13 =71 → 4x=84 → x=21. 

Yes, that seems correct. 

Also, checking angle K in triangle JKL is y, which should correspond to angle Y in triangle WYZ, which is 65°, so y=65. And angle_L is 44°, which corresponds to angle Z in triangle WYZ. 

So all angles add up correctly: 71 + 65 + 44 = 180. 

Yes, that works. So x is 21, which is answer B.
