<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have several length equalities and some geometric relationships. Let me note them down:

1. Length of ME = 20 - 5x
2. Length of HE = 2x + 6
3. Length of BN = y
4. Length of NC = (3/5)y + 2
5. Lines AJ and DK are parallel.
6. Lines GJ and OK are parallel.
7. Points M and E lie on line AJ.
8. Point B lies on line GJ.
9. Point N lies on line GJ.
10. Point C lies on line OK.
11. Line OK has point O on it.
12. ME is congruent to HE.
13. ME is congruent to NB.
14. ME and HE intersect at H, forming point H.
15. BN is perpendicular to HE.

So, the question is to find y. The answer choices are A.3, B.4.5, C.5, D.6.

First, let me focus on the length equalities and congruences. Since ME is congruent to HE, their lengths should be equal. From the first two equations:

ME = 20 - 5x
HE = 2x + 6
Since ME ≅ HE, set them equal:

20 - 5x = 2x + 6

Let me solve for x:

20 - 5x = 2x + 6  
Subtract 2x from both sides: 20 -7x = 6  
Subtract 20: -7x = -14  
Divide by -7: x = 2.

So x is 2. Now, maybe we can use this value to find other lengths? Wait, but the question is about y. Let me check if there are relations involving y.

Looking at the other length equalities:

BN = y  
NC = (3/5)y + 2  

But also, since BN and NC are parts of a line? Wait, points B, N, C... Are they colinear? Let me check the predicates.

Point B lies on line GJ. Point N also lies on line GJ. So B and N are on line GJ. But where is C? It says point C lies on line OK. Also, line OK is parallel to GJ (since lines GJ and OK are parallel). Wait, no, the parallel lines are GJ and OK. Wait, the fifth predicate says Parallel(Line(A,J), Line(D,K)). Then the sixth is Parallel(Line(G,J), Line(O,K)). So Line GJ is parallel to Line OK.

So Line GJ || Line OK. Also, points B and N are on line GJ. Point C is on line OK. Maybe there's something here. Also, BN is perpendicular to HE. Since HE is part of the line ME and HE intersecting at H. 

Wait, let's think about the perpendicularity. BN ⊥ HE. So the line BN is perpendicular to HE. Given that HE is congruent to ME, and ME is congruent to BN. Wait, ME ≅ HE and ME ≅ BN. Therefore, HE ≅ BN. So HE equals BN in length. Wait, HE is 2x + 6. We found x=2, so HE is 2*2 +6 = 10. So HE = 10. Therefore, BN must also be 10. Because ME ≅ HE and ME ≅ BN. So BN = ME = HE = 10. But BN is given as y. So y = 10? But wait, the options don't include 10. That suggests I made a mistake here.

Wait, hold on. Let me re-examine that. The congruence statements:

Congruent(Line(M,E), Line(H,E)) → ME ≅ HE, so their lengths are equal. And Congruent(Line(M,E), Line(N,B)) → ME ≅ NB. So ME = HE = NB. So NB is equal to ME, which is equal to HE. So if ME is 20 -5x, and HE is 2x+6, setting those equal gives us x=2. Then ME = 20 -5*(2) = 20 -10 = 10. Therefore, ME = 10, so HE = 10, and NB = 10. Therefore, BN = y = 10. But none of the answer choices is 10. Hmm, this suggests that perhaps my assumption is wrong. Or maybe there's more to it?

Wait, but the answer choices are up to 6. So maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. Did I misinterpret the congruence? Let me read the congruence again.

It says Congruent(Line(M,E), Line(H,E)) → ME ≅ HE. Then Congruent(Line(M,E), Line(N,B)) → ME ≅ NB. So yes, ME ≅ HE and ME ≅ NB. So ME = HE = NB. But HE is 2x +6. ME is 20-5x. Solving gives x=2, leading to ME=10. Thus, NB=10. But BN is given as y. So y=10. However, the answer choices don't have 10. This suggests that either there's a miscalculation, or perhaps another relationship that affects y.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different way to compute y. Let me check the other length relations. There's also NC = (3/5)y + 2. If BN is 10, then perhaps BC is BN + NC? Wait, but points B, N, C — are they colinear? Let me check.

Points B and N are on line GJ. Point C is on line OK. Also, line OK is parallel to line GJ. So if line OK is parallel to line GJ, then maybe there's a transversal or something. But how does C come into play?

Wait, line OK is parallel to GJ. So if line OK is parallel to GJ, then maybe line NC is related? Wait, point C is on line OK. So if line OK is parallel to line GJ, and points B and N are on line GJ, then perhaps there's a parallelogram or similar triangles involved?

Alternatively, since BN is perpendicular to HE, and HE is part of the line HE. Let me try to visualize this. Let me sketch mentally.

Line HE intersects line ME at point H. Since ME and HE are congruent, and ME is congruent to BN. Also, BN is perpendicular to HE. So BN is perpendicular to HE. Therefore, triangle BHN would be a right triangle with legs BN and HE, and hypotenuse BH?

Wait, but BN is perpendicular to HE, so the right angle is at N? Wait, BN is a line segment; if BN is perpendicular to HE, then the lines BN and HE are perpendicular. So, if HE is a line, and BN is a line segment that is perpendicular to it. So the intersection point could be somewhere. Wait, but where do BN and HE meet? Not sure yet.

But since BN is a line segment from B to N, which are both on line GJ. So line BN is along GJ. Wait, but BN is supposed to be perpendicular to HE. So if line GJ is parallel to OK, and BN is along GJ, then line BN is parallel to OK. Wait, but BN is perpendicular to HE. So HE is perpendicular to line GJ. Therefore, HE is perpendicular to line GJ. So HE is perpendicular to line GJ.

But line GJ is parallel to OK. So HE is also perpendicular to OK. Therefore, HE is perpendicular to OK. But point C is on line OK, so HC is perpendicular to OK. But how does that help?

Alternatively, since HE is perpendicular to GJ (because BN is part of GJ and BN is perpendicular to HE), then HE is perpendicular to GJ. Therefore, HE is a line that is perpendicular to GJ. Also, since line OK is parallel to GJ, HE is also perpendicular to OK. So line HE is perpendicular to OK. Therefore, if point C is on OK, then HC is perpendicular to OK. But how does that connect to the length NC?

Wait, NC is given as (3/5)y + 2. If I can express NC in terms of other variables, maybe I can find y.

But earlier, I thought that BN = y = 10, but that leads to inconsistency with answer choices. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, let me go back. When I said that BN = ME, because ME ≅ NB. But ME is a line segment, and NB is another line segment. Their lengths are equal. So ME = NB. So if ME is 10, then NB is 10. But NB is the length of BN, which is given as y. So y = 10. But since 10 isn't among the options, this suggests that my previous conclusion is wrong. Where is the error?

Wait, maybe the congruence is not about the entire segments but about the lines? No, congruent(Line(M,E), Line(N,B)) refers to the line segments ME and NB being congruent. So their lengths are equal. So ME = NB = HE = 10. Hence, y = 10. But since this is not an option, there must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Alternative possibility: Maybe I misread the congruence. Let me check the original problem again.

The predicates say:

- Congruent(Line(M,E), Line(H,E))
- Congruent(Line(M,E), Line(N,B))

So ME ≅ HE and ME ≅ NB. Therefore, HE ≅ NB. So HE is congruent to NB. But HE is 2x +6, and NB is y. So 2x +6 = y. But earlier, we had ME = HE, so ME = HE = 2x +6. But ME is also 20 -5x. So 20 -5x = 2x +6 → x=2. Then HE = 2*2 +6 = 10. Therefore, y = HE = 10. Again, same result. So why isn't 10 one of the options?

Hmm. Maybe there's another relation involving y. Let me look at the NC length: NC = (3/5)y +2. Perhaps NC relates to something else?

If points B, N, and C are connected, maybe BC is BN + NC? But unless they're colinear. Are B, N, and C colinear? Let me see. B and N are on line GJ. C is on line OK, which is parallel to GJ. So unless there's a connection between these lines.

Alternatively, since line OK is parallel to GJ, and point C is on OK, maybe there's a right triangle formed with HE. For example, since HE is perpendicular to GJ, and OK is parallel to GJ, then HE is also perpendicular to OK. So HE is perpendicular to OK. Therefore, if point C is on OK, then HC is perpendicular to OK, making HC perpendicular to HE. So triangle HEC is a right triangle?

Wait, but without knowing coordinates, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, maybe triangle HEC is right-angled at C? Not sure.

Alternatively, since HE is perpendicular to GJ, and BN is along GJ, then HE is perpendicular to BN. Which we already know. So BN is perpendicular to HE. So triangle BNE is a right triangle with right angle at N. Wait, but where is point E? It's on line AJ, which contains points M and E. Also, line AJ is parallel to DK. But I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to the points to make it easier.

Let me assume coordinate system. Let me place point H at origin (0,0) since it's the intersection of ME and HE. Since HE is perpendicular to BN, and ME is congruent to HE and BN, maybe I can assign coordinates accordingly.

Let me suppose that HE is horizontal and BN is vertical. Since HE is perpendicular to BN.

Let me define H at (0,0). Since HE is a line segment, and HE has length 10 (from earlier calculation). Let me take HE along x-axis. So H is (0,0), E is (10,0). Then ME is congruent to HE, so ME is also length 10. Since M and E are on line AJ. Let me assume that line AJ is such that ME is from M to E. So if E is at (10,0), then M is somewhere on line AJ. But since ME is length 10, and H is the intersection point of ME and HE, which is at (0,0). Wait, the predicate says IntersectAt(Line(M,E), Line(H,E), Line(M,H), Point(H)). So Line ME and Line HE intersect at point H. So H is on both ME and HE. So point H is the intersection of ME and HE. So ME is from M to E, and HE is from H to E. So H is on ME. Therefore, H divides ME into MH and HE. Wait, but earlier we said ME ≅ HE, meaning ME equals HE. So if HE is part of ME, then ME is twice HE? Wait, no. Because ME is the entire segment from M to E, and HE is from H to E. So if ME ≅ HE, then ME = HE. Therefore, H must coincide with M? That doesn't make sense. Wait, this seems contradictory.

Wait, the predicate says: IntersectAt(Line(M,E), Line(H,E), Line(M,H), Point(H)). So Line ME and Line HE intersect at point H. So point H is on both Line ME and Line HE. So H is a point where ME and HE meet. So ME is a line segment from M to E, and HE is a line segment from H to E. So H is a point on ME, and also on HE. So H is a point on ME such that HE is a segment starting at H and going to E. Therefore, ME is from M to E, passing through H. So ME is divided into MH and HE. Since ME ≅ HE, then ME = HE. So ME = HE implies that MH + HE = HE, so MH = 0. That means H coincides with M? That can't be right. Unless H is the same as M, but that would mean Line ME is from M to E, and HE is from M to E, which is the same line. But then the congruence ME ≅ HE would just mean ME = HE, which would imply that H is at M. But that contradicts the fact that H is an intersection point. Wait, this suggests that my earlier assumption that ME = HE is incorrect. Wait, but the predicate says Congruent(Line(M,E), Line(H,E)). So Line ME is congruent to Line HE. Wait, but Line ME is the entire line, while Line HE is another line? No, the congruence of line segments, not lines. Wait, the term "Congruent" in geometry usually refers to congruent segments. So Line ME and Line HE are congruent as segments. So ME = HE in length. But if H is on ME, then HE is part of ME. So ME = HE implies that HE is the entire segment ME, so H must be at M. Which would make HE = ME, but then H is M. But the predicate says IntersectAt(Line(M,E), Line(H,E), Line(M,H), Point(H)). So if H is M, then Line(H,E) is Line(M,E), and Line(M,H) is Line(M,M), which is undefined. This suggests that my interpretation is wrong.

Ah! Here's the confusion. The predicate says "IntersectAt(Line(M,E), Line(H,E), Line(M,H), Point(H))". So three lines intersect at point H. Line ME, Line HE, and Line MH all intersect at H. Wait, Line ME is from M to E. Line HE is from H to E. Line MH is from M to H. So H is a point where Line ME meets Line HE and Line MH. So H is a point on ME such that Line HE starts at H and goes to E. Therefore, ME is from M to E, and H is a point on ME such that HE is a segment from H to E. Therefore, ME is longer than HE. So ME = MH + HE. But the congruence says ME ≅ HE. So ME = HE. Therefore, MH + HE = HE ⇒ MH = 0 ⇒ M=H. Which again suggests H=M. But that conflicts with the existence of Line MH. So this contradiction indicates that there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the congruence is between the segments ME and HE, meaning that their lengths are equal. So |ME| = |HE|. But if H is a point on ME, then |ME| = |MH| + |HE|. So if |ME| = |HE|, then |MH| = 0 ⇒ M=H. Which is impossible unless M=H. But according to the predicate, PointLiesOnLine(M, Line(A,J)) and PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(A,J)), so M and E are on line AJ. Also, PointLiesOnLine(H, Line(A,J))? Wait, no. The predicate says PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(A,J)), and PointLiesOnLine(M, Line(A,J)). What about H? Is H on Line(A,J)? The predicate says IntersectAt(Line(M,E), Line(H,E), Line(M,H), Point(H)). So Line ME and Line HE intersect at H. Line ME is from M to E, which are on line AJ. Line HE is from H to E. So if Line ME is on line AJ, and Line HE intersects it at H, then H must also be on line AJ. So H is on line AJ. Therefore, H is on line AJ. So points M, E, and H are on line AJ. So ME is a segment on line AJ from M to E, and H is a point on ME such that HE is a segment from H to E. So ME = |ME|, HE = |HE|. If they are congruent, then |ME| = |HE|. So |ME| = |HE|, implying that H is at M? No, because |ME| = |HE| would require that the distance from M to E equals the distance from H to E. So if H is between M and E, then |ME| = |MH| + |HE|. Setting |ME| = |HE| gives |MH| + |HE| = |HE| ⇒ |MH| = 0 ⇒ M=H. Again, this suggests H=M. But this can't be right. So where is the error?

Wait, maybe the congruence is between the segments ME and HE, but H is not necessarily between M and E. Suppose H is not between M and E. For example, if H is beyond E. Let's say the line AJ extends beyond E. So ME is from M to E, and HE is from H to E, with H outside of ME. Then |ME| = |HE| would mean that the distance from M to E equals the distance from H to E. So H is located such that E is the midpoint between M and H. In this case, |ME| = |EH|, so EH = ME. So H is such that E is the midpoint between M and H. So coordinates: Let's say M is at (a, b), E is at (c, d). Then H would be at (2c - a, 2d - b), so that E is the midpoint between M and H. Then |ME| = |EH|. This scenario is possible.

Therefore, even though H is not between M and E, the congruence holds. So this resolves the earlier contradiction. So in this case, H is not between M and E but rather extending the line beyond E. So this allows for |ME| = |HE| without requiring H to be between M and E.

This changes things. So with this understanding, we can proceed.

Now, returning to the earlier calculation where x=2, leading to ME = HE = 10. So |ME| = |HE| = 10. 

Now, since BN is congruent to ME, so |BN| = |ME| = 10. Hence, y = 10. But again, 10 is not among the answer choices. This suggests there's an error in my reasoning.

Wait, maybe the congruence is not between ME and HE, but between ME and NB? Let me check the predicates again.

The second congruence is Congruent(Line(M,E), Line(N,B)). So ME ≅ NB. So |ME| = |NB|. Earlier, we found |ME| = 10, so |NB| = 10, hence y = 10. Still same issue.

But since the answer choices don't include 10, I must have missed something. Let me re-examine the other parts of the problem.

Looking at the NC length: NC = (3/5)y + 2. If I can find another expression for NC, perhaps involving other lengths, then I can solve for y.

How is NC related to other elements? Point C is on line OK, which is parallel to GJ. Points B and N are on GJ. Since line OK is parallel to GJ, and point C is on OK, perhaps there is a relationship between BN and NC via similarity or something else.

Also, BN is perpendicular to HE. So BN ⊥ HE. And since HE is congruent to ME, which is 10, and BN is 10. So BN is perpendicular to HE. Let me consider the coordinates again. Let me try to model this.

Assume HE is a horizontal line, and BN is vertical. Let me set coordinates:

Let’s place point H at (0,0), and since HE is horizontal, point E is at (10,0) because |HE|=10. Then, since BN is perpendicular to HE, BN is vertical. Let me assume that BN is vertical upwards from point N. Let me assume that point B is at (a, b) and point N is at (a, b + 10), since BN has length 10 and is vertical. But this is arbitrary.

But since points B and N are on line GJ, which is parallel to OK. Also, line OK is parallel to GJ. Let me try to find coordinates for line GJ. Since line GJ contains points B and N. Let me assume that line GJ has some slope. Since BN is perpendicular to HE, and HE is horizontal, then BN is vertical, so line GJ is vertical. Hence, line GJ is vertical. Therefore, points B and N are on a vertical line. So their x-coordinates are the same. Let me say line GJ is the y-axis for simplicity. So points B and N are on the y-axis.

So point B is (p, q) and N is (p, r), with BN length being |q - r| = 10. Since BN is vertical.

Now, line OK is parallel to GJ, which is vertical, so line OK is also vertical. Point C is on line OK. So line OK is vertical, and point C is on it. Let me assume that line OK passes through point O. But the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(O, Line(O,K)), which probably means that O is on line OK (which is trivial), but maybe it's indicating that O is a point on line OK. So line OK is vertical, and point C is on it.

Now, since HE is horizontal from (0,0) to (10,0), and line GJ is vertical (the y-axis). Let me assume line GJ is the y-axis, so points B and N are on the y-axis. Let me choose coordinates for B and N. Let me say point B is (0, b) and point N is (0, n). Then BN length is |b - n| = 10. So, for example, if B is (0, 0), then N is (0, 10), or vice versa.

But where is point C? It's on line OK, which is vertical. Let me assume line OK is some vertical line, say x = c. Point C is on it, so its coordinates are (c, k).

Now, the line NC connects point N (on GJ, which is y-axis) to point C (on OK, which is x=c). So line NC connects (0, n) to (c, k). The length of NC is given by sqrt[(c-0)^2 + (k-n)^2] = sqrt(c² + (k-n)^2). According to the predicate, this equals (3/5)y + 2. But y is |BN| = 10, so NC = (3/5)*10 + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8. So NC should be 8. Therefore, sqrt(c² + (k-n)^2) = 8. Squaring both sides: c² + (k-n)^2 = 64.

But I don't know the values of c, k, or n. How can I find more relations?

Perhaps there's a relationship between NC and other elements. Since line OK is parallel to GJ (both vertical), and HE is horizontal. Also, BN is perpendicular to HE, which is satisfied since BN is vertical and HE is horizontal. 

Maybe triangle HEC is related? Point C is on OK, which is parallel to GJ. Since OK is vertical, and HE is horizontal, the line HE is horizontal from (0,0) to (10,0). Point C is on OK, which is vertical. Let me assume line OK is x = c. Let me pick c as some value. Let's say OK is x = 10, for example. Then point C is (10, k). Then NC is from N (0, n) to (10, k). So length NC is sqrt((10-0)^2 + (k-n)^2) = sqrt(100 + (k-n)^2). Set this equal to 8: sqrt(100 + (k-n)^2) = 8 → 100 + (k-n)^2 = 64 → (k-n)^2 = -36. Impossible. So this suggests that OK cannot be x=10. So maybe OK is not at x=10.

Alternatively, maybe OK is another vertical line. Let me assume that OK is x = d. Then, point C is (d, k). Then NC length is sqrt(d² + (k-n)^2) = 8. Without more info, this seems stuck.

Wait, but there might be another relation. Since line OK is parallel to GJ, and GJ is vertical, OK is vertical. Also, line OK contains point C, and possibly other points. But how does this help?

Alternatively, since line OK is parallel to GJ, and HE is perpendicular to GJ, then HE is also perpendicular to OK. So HE is horizontal, OK is vertical, so HE is perpendicular to OK. Therefore, line HE is perpendicular to OK. So point C is on OK, so the line from H to C is perpendicular to OK. Since OK is vertical, then HC is horizontal. So HC is horizontal. Since H is at (0,0), and OK is vertical, then line HC is horizontal, so point C must be horizontally aligned with H. So if OK is vertical, then HC is horizontal, so point C is (h, 0) for some h. But OK is vertical, so point C is on OK, which is x = h. So OK is the vertical line x=h. Then point C is (h, 0), since it's on OK and HC is horizontal. Wait, but HC is from H(0,0) to C(h,0), so it's horizontal. So yes, that works.

Then, NC is the distance from N (which is on GJ, the y-axis) to C(h, 0). Let's say N is (0, n). Then NC length is sqrt((h-0)^2 + (0 - n)^2) = sqrt(h² + n²) = 8. So h² + n² = 64.

But we also know that BN is vertical from B to N. Let me assume B is (0, b) and N is (0, n), so BN length is |n - b| = 10. So n - b = ±10. Let's say n = b + 10 (assuming N is above B).

Now, what else do we know? Line OK is x=h, and point C is (h, 0). Also, line OK is parallel to GJ, which is the y-axis. So OK is vertical, which it is.

But how to find h or n? Maybe there's another relation involving point C.

Wait, since point C is on line OK, which is parallel to GJ, and line OK is vertical. Also, since line OK is parallel to GJ, and GJ contains points B and N, which are on the y-axis. So line OK is vertical, like the y-axis. But we already assumed that. 

Is there a relation between point C and other points? For instance, maybe triangle HEC or something? Or since HE is horizontal from (0,0) to (10,0), and C is (h,0), then EC is from E(10,0) to C(h,0), which would be horizontal. But then NC is from N(0,n) to C(h,0), which we've already considered.

But we need to find h and n such that h² + n² = 64. But without more constraints, this seems underdetermined. However, we might have another equation from the fact that line OK is parallel to GJ, and line OK passes through point C, which is (h,0). But how?

Wait, perhaps line OK passes through point O, which is mentioned in the predicate: PointLiesOnLine(O, Line(O,K)). This is likely redundant, but perhaps O is another point on line OK. But without more info, it's unclear.

Alternatively, since line OK is parallel to GJ (vertical), and line HE is horizontal, and HE is perpendicular to OK, which we've already used. 

Wait, but maybe there's a relation between NC and other segments? For example, if NC is part of a right triangle with HE or something. Or perhaps the coordinates of C relate to other points.

Alternatively, since line OK is parallel to GJ, and line GJ contains points B and N, which are on the y-axis, and line OK is vertical. So OK is the same as GJ? No, because they are parallel, but not necessarily the same line. So OK is another vertical line. 

But without more information, it's difficult to find h and n. However, we have from the NC length equation: h² + n² = 64. But we also know that BN = 10, so n - b = 10. But we don't know b. So this seems insufficient.

Wait, but maybe there's another relation from the fact that line OK is parallel to GJ, and line OK contains point C. Also, line OK is parallel to GJ, which is vertical. So OK is vertical. So line OK is vertical, and point C is on it. But how does this relate to other parts?

Alternatively, since line OK is parallel to GJ, and line HE is perpendicular to GJ, then HE is also perpendicular to OK. So HE is horizontal, OK is vertical, and point C is on OK. So HC is horizontal. So point C is horizontally aligned with H. So if H is at (0,0), then C is at (c, 0) for some c. So point C is (c, 0). Then, NC is the distance from N(0, n) to C(c, 0): sqrt(c² + n²) = 8. So c² + n² = 64. But we also have that BN = 10, so |n - b| = 10. But without knowing b, this still leaves too many variables.

However, there might be another constraint from the fact that line OK is parallel to GJ, and line OK contains point C. But since GJ is the y-axis, and OK is parallel to it, OK is another vertical line. So if we assume that OK is the same as GJ, then C would be on GJ, but that's not necessarily true. 

Wait, but if OK is parallel to GJ, and GJ is the y-axis, then OK is any vertical line. So without more information, it's impossible to determine c or n. This suggests that there's missing information, but the problem must have a unique solution, so I must have missed something.

Let me revisit the initial equations. We have from the congruence ME = HE = 10, and BN = 10. So y = 10. But since this isn't an option, perhaps the error is in assuming ME = HE. Let me double-check the congruence.

The predicate says Congruent(Line(M,E), Line(H,E)). So the length of ME equals the length of HE. So |ME| = |HE|. But earlier, I assumed that H is on ME, but that led to contradictions. However, if H is not on ME, but instead, Line ME and Line HE intersect at H, which is not on ME? No, because Line ME is from M to E, and Line HE is from H to E. So they intersect at E? Wait, if Line ME and Line HE intersect at H, then H must be a point where they cross. So if Line ME is from M to E, and Line HE is from H to E, then they intersect at E. So H is a point such that Line HE starts at H and ends at E. So H is not on Line ME unless H=E. But then Line ME and Line HE would be the same line, which would make the congruence |ME| = |HE| mean that |ME| = |HE|, but if H=E, then HE is zero length. Contradiction again.

This suggests that there's a fundamental misunderstanding in interpreting the predicates. Let me try a different approach, focusing on the given equations and trying to find y without relying on coordinate systems.

From earlier, we have x=2, leading to ME = 10, HE = 10. Since ME ≅ NB, then NB = 10, so y = 10. But since this is not an option, perhaps there's a mistake in the congruence interpretation. Let me recheck the predicates.

The predicate says Congruent(Line(M,E), Line(H,E)). This means the segment ME is congruent to segment HE. So |ME| = |HE|. Similarly, Congruent(Line(M,E), Line(N,B)) means |ME| = |NB|. So |ME| = |HE| = |NB|. 

But if |ME| = |HE|, and ME is a segment from M to E, and HE is a segment from H to E, then H must be such that |HE| = |ME|. This can happen if H is a reflection of M over E, or if H is such that E is the midpoint between M and H. For example, if E is the midpoint, then |ME| = |HE|. So in this case, H is symmetric to M with respect to E. So if M is at position x, then H is at position 2E - M. This would make |ME| = |HE|. 

In this case, since ME = HE, and ME = 10, then HE = 10. So H is positioned such that E is the midpoint between M and H. 

Now, with this understanding, let's consider BN = ME = 10. So y = 10. But since this isn't an option, perhaps the error is in the calculation of x. Let me recheck that.

Given ME = 20 -5x, HE = 2x +6. Setting them equal:

20 -5x = 2x +6  
20 -6 = 7x  
14 = 7x  
x = 2. Correct.

So x=2, ME = 20 - 10 = 10. HE = 10. So BN = 10, so y=10. But since 10 is not an option, I must have made a wrong assumption.

Wait, maybe the congruence is between ME and HE, but ME and HE are not line segments but lines? No, congruence of lines is not standard; it's about segments.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves vectors or direction, but that's unlikely.

Wait, the problem may involve similar triangles. Let me think about the perpendicularity. BN is perpendicular to HE, and BN = 10. Let me consider the right triangle formed by BN and HE. If BN is perpendicular to HE, and if they form a right angle, then maybe there's a right triangle where BN and HE are legs, and BH is the hypotenuse. But without knowing BH, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, since BN is perpendicular to HE, and BN = 10, HE = 10, then the area of the right triangle formed by BN and HE would be (10*10)/2 = 50. But I don't see how this helps.

Wait, but the length NC is given as (3/5)y + 2. If I substitute y=10, NC = (3/5)*10 + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8. So NC = 8. If I can find NC through another method, maybe I can verify.

If NC = 8, and BN = 10, then perhaps BC is BN + NC = 18, or BN - NC = 2, depending on the configuration. But without knowing if B, N, C are colinear, I can't say.

But if B, N, C are colinear, then BC = BN + NC or |BN - NC|. If they are on the same line, then BC = BN + NC if C is beyond N from B, or BC = |BN - NC| otherwise.

But how to determine if B, N, C are colinear? Let me think about the lines involved. Points B and N are on line GJ. Point C is on line OK, which is parallel to GJ. So if line OK is parallel to GJ, and C is on OK, then line OC is parallel to GJ. If line BC is on GJ, then C would have to be on GJ, but it's on OK. So unless OK intersects GJ, which it might not, since they are parallel. So unless OK and GJ are the same line, which they aren't (since they are parallel). So point C is on OK, which is parallel to GJ, so C is not on GJ. Hence, B and C are not on the same line. So BC is not directly related to NC.

Thus, this approach is stuck.

But the problem must have a solution among the given options. Since y=10 is not an option, perhaps there's an error in assuming that ME = HE = 10. Let me re-express the congruences.

Wait, the congruence is between Line(M,E) and Line(H,E). Could this mean that the entire lines are congruent, not just the segments? But lines are infinite, so their lengths are infinite, which doesn't make sense. So it must refer to the segments. Hence, |ME| = |HE|.

Another possibility: Maybe the problem uses directed segments or vector directions, but that's unlikely in standard geometry problems.

Alternatively, maybe the length of ME is 20 -5x, and the length of HE is 2x +6, and they are congruent, so 20 -5x = 2x +6 → x=2. This is correct. So ME = 10, HE = 10. Then, since ME ≅ NB, NB = 10, so y = 10. But since this isn't an option, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I missed a key piece of information.

Wait, looking back at the predicates, there is also the perpendicularity: Perpendicular(Line(B,N), Line(H,E)). So BN is perpendicular to HE. So the product of their slopes is -1. But how does this help?

If I assume that HE is horizontal, then BN is vertical, as before. So if HE is horizontal, then its slope is 0. BN is vertical, so its slope is undefined. This is consistent.

Now, if BN is vertical and HE is horizontal, and BN has length 10, then the coordinates setup as before. Now, NC is from N to C, which is on OK, which is parallel to GJ (vertical). So OK is vertical, and C is on it. Let me assume that OK is the same as GJ, but that would mean C is on GJ. But since GJ contains B and N, and OK is parallel to GJ, it's possible that OK is another vertical line, and C is on it.

But without more info, it's still stuck. However, from the NC length, we have NC = (3/5)y + 2. If y=10, then NC=8. So if I can find another expression for NC, maybe I can solve for y.

But how?

Wait, perhaps NC is part of a similar triangle. Since BN is perpendicular to HE, and HE is horizontal, and OK is parallel to GJ (vertical), and C is on OK. If I can find the ratio of NC to BN, it might relate to the slopes.

Alternatively, since OK is parallel to GJ, and BN is perpendicular to HE, which is horizontal, so BN is vertical. If OK is parallel to GJ, and GJ contains B and N, which are on a vertical line, then OK is also vertical. So line OK is vertical, and C is on it. So if I consider the vertical line OK, and point C is on it. Let me assume that OK is the same as GJ, so C is on GJ. But then C would be on GJ, which contains B and N. So C is on GJ, and NC is a segment on GJ. So NC would be part of GJ, and since BN is also on GJ, then NC would be a segment from N to C on GJ. But in this case, NC would be |N - C|, and since BN = 10, and NC = (3/5)y + 2, with y=10, NC=8, then if N is at position n on GJ, and C is at position c, then |c - n| = 8. But without knowing where C is, this is still ambiguous.

But if C is on GJ, then line OK is GJ, which is parallel to itself, which is trivial. But this would mean that OK is GJ, and C is on GJ. So NC is a segment on GJ from N to C. Then, if I assume that C is a certain distance from N, but how?

Wait, but the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(O,K)), which is Line OK. If OK is GJ, then C is on GJ, which it is. So this is possible. 

So if OK is GJ, then line OK is GJ, and C is on it. So C is on GJ. So NC is a segment on GJ from N to C. So if BN is 10, and NC is 8, then BC would be BN + NC = 18, or |BN - NC| = 2, depending on the positions. But how to find this?

But without knowing the position of C, it's still not helpful. 

Wait, but maybe there's a relationship between HE and NC. Since HE is 10, and NC is 8, and BN is 10. Maybe there's a proportion or something. For example, if HE is 10, and NC is 8, then (3/5)y + 2 = 8, which would give (3/5)y = 6 → y = 10. Which brings us back to y=10. So this confirms that if NC=8, then y=10. But since this is not an option, there must be a miscalculation.

Wait, but perhaps the length of NC is not (3/5)y + 2, but something else? Let me recheck the given predicates.

Yes, it says Equals(LengthOf(Line(N,C)), (3/5)y + 2). So NC = (3/5)y + 2. If y=10, then NC= (3/5)*10 + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8. So this is correct. But since this leads to y=10, which is not an option, I must have made a mistake in assuming that ME = HE = 10. Let me re-examine the congruence.

Wait, the predicate says Congruent(Line(M,E), Line(H,E)). This might mean that the lines ME and HE are congruent, but in terms of their slopes or something else? No, congruence in geometry refers to length. So it must be about length. So |ME| = |HE|.

Unless there's a misinterpretation of the predicate. Maybe the congruence is between the lines, not the segments. But lines are infinite, so they can't be congruent in length. So this must refer to the segments.

Given that, and the calculation leading
