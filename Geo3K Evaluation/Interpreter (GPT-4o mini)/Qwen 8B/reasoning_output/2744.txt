Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, C, D involved. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

First, the predicates mention two triangles: Triangle(A,B,C) and Triangle(A,B,D). That means points A, B, C form a triangle, and points A, B, D also form a triangle. Then there are some angle measures given. 

We know that measure of angle at A, B, D is x (but wait, the first predicate says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A, B, D)), x), so maybe that's angle at point B? Wait, Angle(A, B, D) would be the angle at point B between points A and D. So angle ABC? Or wait, the notation is a bit confusing here. In standard terms, Angle(A, B, D) refers to the angle at point B formed by points A, B, D. So that's angle ABD. Similarly, MeasureOf(Angle(B, A, D)) is angle at A between B and D, so angle BAD. And MeasureOf(Angle(B, C, D)) is angle at C between B and D, so angle BCD. 

Then we're told that MeasureOf(Angle(B, A, D)) is 69 degrees. So angle BAD is 69°. Also, MeasureOf(Angle(B, C, D)) is 55°, so angle BCD is 55°. Additionally, the question asks for m∠ABC, which is the angle at point B between points A and C, so angle ABC. And we're given that m∠CDA is 61°, which is angle at D between C and A, so angle CDA.

So putting it all together, we need to find the measure of angle ABC. Let me visualize this. Points A, B, C, D. Since there are two triangles involving A, B, and another point each. Let me sketch mentally:

Triangles ABC and ABD share side AB. Point D is connected to A and B, forming triangle ABD. Also, there's point C connected to B and D, forming triangle BCD. Hmm. Also, angle CDA is given as 61°, which is part of triangle ADC?

Wait, angle CDA is at point D, so points C, D, A. So that's angle ADC. So in triangle ADC, angle at D is 61°. But how do these points relate? Maybe quadrilateral ABCD? Or perhaps some other configuration.

Let me think about the triangles again. Triangle ABD has angles at A, B, D. We know angle at A (BAD) is 69°, and angle at B is something (ABD?), but we don't know yet. Similarly, triangle BCD has angle at C (BCD) as 55°, and angle at D (maybe angle BDC?) but not sure yet.

But since we need to find angle ABC, which is part of triangle ABC. Let me consider the entire figure. Points A, B, C, D. Since ABC and ABD are triangles, maybe D is connected to C somehow? Because angle CDA is mentioned. So point D is connected to C and A, making triangle ADC with angle at D being 61°.

Let me try to outline the connections:

- Triangle ABC: points A, B, C.
- Triangle ABD: points A, B, D.
- Triangle BCD: points B, C, D.
- Triangle ADC: points A, D, C.

So the full figure includes points A, B, C, D connected in such a way that they form these triangles. Now, trying to find angle ABC (at point B between A and C).

Given angles:

- Angle BAD = 69° (from MeasureOf(Angle(B, A, D))).
- Angle BCD = 55° (MeasureOf(Angle(B, C, D))).
- Angle CDA = 61° (given).

Also, note that in triangle ABD, we know one angle (BAD=69°), and in triangle BCD, we know angle BCD=55°, and in triangle ADC, angle ADC=61°.

Perhaps I should look for cyclic quadrilaterals or use triangle angle sums. Alternatively, check for supplementary angles or vertical angles.

Alternatively, since multiple triangles are present, maybe applying the sum of angles in each triangle.

Starting with triangle ABD. In triangle ABD, the angles are at A (BAD=69°), at B (ABD=?), and at D (ADB=?). The sum of angles should be 180°, so:

Angle BAD + angle ABD + angle ADB = 180°
69° + angle ABD + angle ADB = 180°
So angle ABD + angle ADB = 111°.

Similarly, looking at triangle ADC. Angles at A, D, C. Given angle at D (ADC)=61°, and angle at C? Well, angle at C in triangle ADC is angle ACD. But angle BCD is given as 55°, which is part of triangle BCD. Wait, angle BCD is angle at C between B and D, which is adjacent to angle ACD? Depending on where point D is located relative to C.

Assuming points are arranged such that D is outside triangle ABC, connecting to A and C. For example, imagine triangle ABC with D somewhere such that AD and CD connect to form the other triangles.

Alternatively, maybe D lies inside triangle ABC? Not sure yet. Need more info.

Another thought: In triangle ADC, angles are angle at A (DAC), angle at D (ADC=61°), angle at C (ACD). Sum to 180°, so:

angle DAC + 61° + angle ACD = 180° → angle DAC + angle ACD = 119°.

Now, angle BCD is 55°, which is angle at C between B and D. So angle BCD is adjacent to angle ACD? If points A, C, D are connected, then angle at C between B and D would be angle BCD, which could be split into angle ACB (if D is on the same line as BC?) or part of another angle.

Wait, maybe considering triangle BCD. In triangle BCD, angles at B, C, D. Given angle at C is 55°, and angles at B and D are unknown. Sum of angles is 180°, so:

angle CBD + 55° + angle BDC = 180° → angle CBD + angle BDC = 125°.

Hmm. Also, angle ABD from earlier was part of triangle ABD, and angle CBD is part of triangle BCD. Are those angles related? If points A, B, D are connected, then angle ABD is at point B between A and D. Meanwhile, angle CBD is at point B between C and D. So depending on the position of D, these angles may add up to angle ABC. Wait! Because angle ABC is at point B between A and C. If D is positioned such that BD splits angle ABC into two parts: angle ABD and angle CBD. So angle ABC = angle ABD + angle CBD.

Ah! That seems promising. So if that's the case, then angle ABC = angle ABD + angle CBD. From earlier, in triangle ABD, angle ABD + angle ADB = 111°, and in triangle BCD, angle CBD + angle BDC = 125°. However, angle ADB and angle BDC might be related. Because angle ADB is part of triangle ABD, and angle BDC is part of triangle BCD. If points A, D, C are connected, then angles at D (ADB and BDC) could be supplementary if points A, D, C are colinear? No, unless D is on line AC. Wait, but angle ADC is given as 61°, which is part of triangle ADC. So if D is connected to A and C, then angle ADC is at D between A and C. So that suggests that points A, D, C form triangle ADC with angle at D being 61°.

Therefore, in triangle ADC, angles at A (DAC), D (61°), and C (ACD) sum to 180°, so DAC + ACD = 119°, as before.

Now, angle ABD is part of triangle ABD, and angle CBD is part of triangle BCD. Also, angle ABD and angle CBD are adjacent, adding up to angle ABC. So if we can find angle ABD and angle CBD, we can sum them.

But how?

Looking back, in triangle ABD, angle ABD + angle ADB = 111°. In triangle BCD, angle CBD + angle BDC = 125°. So if we can find angle ADB and angle BDC, we can find angle ABD and angle CBD respectively.

But angle ADB and angle BDC are angles at D. Let me see: In triangle ADC, angle at D is 61°, which is angle ADC. How does that relate to angles ADB and BDC?

If we consider point D connected to A, B, and C. So from point D, there are lines DA, DB, DC. Therefore, the angles around D would be:

At point D, angles between DA and DB (angle ADB), between DB and DC (angle BDC), and between DC and DA (angle ADC). These three angles should add up to 360° if D is a point with three lines coming out. Wait, but angle ADC is given as 61°, which is the angle between DC and DA. So angle ADC = angle between DC and DA = 61°. Therefore, angles around D: angle ADB + angle BDC + angle ADC = 360°? Wait, no, because if you have three lines from D: DA, DB, DC, then the sum of angles around D would be 360°, but angle ADC is the angle between DA and DC, which is different from the angles between DA and DB, and DB and DC.

Actually, angle ADC is the angle between DA and DC, which is separate from the other angles. So, the sum of angles around D would be:

angle ADB (between DA and DB) + angle BDC (between DB and DC) + angle CDA (which is angle ADC, between DC and DA)? Wait, no. If you have three rays from D: DA, DB, DC, then the total around D is 360°, which equals the sum of the angles between each pair of rays. So:

angle between DA and DB (angle ADB) + angle between DB and DC (angle BDC) + angle between DC and DA (angle CDA) = 360°.

But angle CDA is given as 61°, so:

angle ADB + angle BDC + 61° = 360° → angle ADB + angle BDC = 360° - 61° = 299°.

But earlier, from triangle ABD: angle ABD + angle ADB = 111°, so angle ADB = 111° - angle ABD.

From triangle BCD: angle CBD + angle BDC = 125°, so angle BDC = 125° - angle CBD.

Substituting into the equation above:

(111° - angle ABD) + (125° - angle CBD) = 299°

Which simplifies to:

111° + 125° - angle ABD - angle CBD = 299°

Calculating 111 + 125 = 236°, so:

236° - (angle ABD + angle CBD) = 299°

Rearranged:

-angle ABD - angle CBD = 299° - 236° = 63°

Multiply both sides by -1:

angle ABD + angle CBD = -63°

Wait, that can't be possible. Angles can't be negative. This suggests an error in my reasoning.

Where did I go wrong?

Let me re-examine the assumption about the angles around point D. If angle ADC is 61°, that's the angle between DC and DA. However, the other angles at D are angle ADB and angle BDC. But depending on the configuration of the points, these angles might not cover the entire 360°. For instance, if D is inside the triangle ABC, then the angles around D might not add up to 360°, but rather depend on the structure.

Wait, perhaps D is not inside the triangle ABC. Maybe it's outside. Let me consider different configurations.

Alternative approach: Let's assume that points A, B, C, D form a quadrilateral. Suppose ABCD is a quadrilateral. Then, angle ADC is one of its angles. However, without knowing the type of quadrilateral, it's hard to say. But given the presence of triangles ABD and BCD, maybe D is connected to both A and B, and to C.

Alternatively, think of ABCD as a quadrilateral with diagonals. For example, if ABCD is a quadrilateral, then diagonals AC and BD intersect at some point, but that's speculative.

Wait, but given the presence of triangles ABD, ABC, BCD, and ADC, perhaps D is connected to all points except maybe C? No, because triangle BCD exists, so D is connected to C.

Maybe D is connected to A, B, and C. So, D is connected to A, B, and C. So, in that case, the angles at D would involve angles between DA and DB, DB and DC, and DC and DA. Which would make the sum of those three angles equal to 360°, assuming D is a point with three lines going out. So angle ADB (between DA and DB), angle BDC (between DB and DC), and angle ADC (between DC and DA). Therefore, their sum is 360°, leading to angle ADB + angle BDC + angle ADC = 360°, hence angle ADB + angle BDC = 360° - angle ADC = 360° - 61° = 299°, as before.

But earlier substitution led to angle ABD + angle CBD = -63°, which is impossible. Hence, contradiction implies that my assumption about the relationship between angle ABD and angle CBD is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps angle ABC isn't simply angle ABD + angle CBD? Maybe D is not on the same side as C relative to AB, so that angle ABD and angle CBD are not adjacent. For example, if D is on the opposite side of AB from C, then angle ABD and angle CBD would not add up directly to angle ABC. So maybe that's the mistake here.

Let me think again. If D is positioned such that BD is extending from B away from C, then angle ABD and angle CBD would be on opposite sides of AB, so they wouldn't combine to make angle ABC. Instead, angle ABC would be part of triangle ABC, and angles at B related to D would be different.

This complicates things. So maybe I need to consider other approaches.

Let me try focusing on triangle ADC. We know angle at D is 61°, and if I can find other angles in triangle ADC, that might help. But we need relations between angles in other triangles.

Alternatively, consider triangle ABD and triangle CBD. Let's see:

In triangle ABD: angles are BAD=69°, angle ABD=x, angle ADB=y. So 69 + x + y = 180 => x + y = 111.

In triangle BCD: angles are BCD=55°, angle CBD=z, angle BDC=w. So 55 + z + w = 180 => z + w = 125.

Earlier, I assumed that angles at D (y and w) plus angle ADC=61° equals 360°, giving y + w = 299°, but that led to inconsistency. Perhaps that assumption is wrong.

Wait, angle ADC is part of triangle ADC. So angle ADC is the angle at D between A and C. If we consider the angles at D, which are angle ADB (between A and B), angle BDC (between B and C), and angle ADC (between A and C). But if D is such that points A, D, C are connected, then angle ADC is indeed the angle between DA and DC, while angle ADB is between DA and DB, and angle BDC is between DB and DC. Thus, the sum of these three angles would be 360°, so:

angle ADB (y) + angle BDC (w) + angle ADC (61°) = 360° ⇒ y + w = 299°.

But earlier, from triangles ABD and BCD, we had x + y = 111 and z + w = 125. So substituting y = 111 - x and w = 125 - z into y + w = 299:

(111 - x) + (125 - z) = 299 ⇒ 236 - (x + z) = 299 ⇒ x + z = 236 - 299 = -63°.

Again, getting x + z = -63°, which is impossible. So this suggests that my initial assumptions about the configuration are incorrect.

Alternative idea: Maybe angle ADC is not part of the angles around D? Perhaps D is not a point where three lines meet? Or maybe D is inside triangle ABC, making the angles around D different?

Wait, if D is inside triangle ABC, then the angles around D would still sum to 360°, but angle ADC would be an internal angle. Let me try to think differently.

Suppose D is inside triangle ABC. Then, lines AD and BD divide the triangle. So, in this case, angle ADC is part of triangle ADC. But then, angle ADC is formed by DC and DA, so point D is connected to A and C.

But if D is inside triangle ABC, then angle ADC would be an internal angle, and the other angles at D (like ADB and BDC) would be other internal angles.

But even so, the sum of angles around D should still be 360°, so angle ADB + angle BDC + angle ADC = 360°. Hence, same as before. But this leads us to the same contradiction.

Hmm. There must be a different approach. Let me try to focus on the triangles and see if I can find relations between angles.

Since we need to find angle ABC, which is part of triangle ABC. Let's denote angle ABC as θ (theta). In triangle ABC, the angles are at A, B, and C. Let's call them:

At A: angle BAC
At B: angle ABC = θ
At C: angle BCA

Sum to 180°, so angle BAC + θ + angle BCA = 180°.

But how to find these angles?

We know from earlier that angle BAD = 69°, which is part of angle BAC if D is on the same side as C. Wait, if D is on the extension of AC, or somewhere else?

Wait, angle BAD is the angle at A between BA and DA. So if we consider triangle ABD, then DA is connected to A. So point D is connected to A, and BA is part of the triangle ABC. So, depending on where D is, angle BAD could be part of angle BAC or not.

If D is on the same side of AB as point C, then angle BAD would be part of angle BAC. Otherwise, it might be external.

This seems too vague. Let me think of specific cases.

Case 1: Assume that D is on the extension of AC beyond C. Then, angle BAD would be angle between BA and DA, which would be larger than angle BAC. But this might complicate things.

Case 2: Assume that D is somewhere such that AD intersects BC. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, consider that angle BAD = 69°, angle BCD = 55°, and angle ADC = 61°. Maybe using the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines in some triangles.

For example, in triangle ADC, we know angle at D is 61°, and if we can find other angles or sides, maybe relate to other triangles.

But without knowing any side lengths, it's difficult. However, maybe we can set variables and write equations.

Let me assign variables:

Let’s denote:

In triangle ABD:
- angle at A: BAD = 69°
- angle at B: ABD = α
- angle at D: ADB = β
Thus, α + β = 111° (since 69 + α + β = 180)

In triangle BCD:
- angle at C: BCD = 55°
- angle at B: CBD = γ
- angle at D: BDC = δ
Thus, γ + δ = 125° (since 55 + γ + δ = 180)

In triangle ADC:
- angle at D: ADC = 61°
- angle at A: DAC = ε
- angle at C: ACD = φ
Thus, ε + φ = 119° (since 61 + ε + φ = 180)

Now, if we can relate these variables. For example, angle at A in triangle ADC (ε) might relate to angle BAD (69°) if D is positioned such that DAC is part of angle BAD or something. Or vice versa.

Alternatively, if we consider the straight line from A to D, and the angles around point A. At point A, angles BAD (69°) and DAC (ε) might add up to angle BAC if D is on the same line as C. Or if D is on the other side, subtract.

Assume that points B, A, D are arranged such that angle BAD is part of angle BAC. Wait, but angle BAC is part of triangle ABC. So if D is on the same side of AB as C, then angle BAD is part of angle BAC. So angle BAC = angle BAD + angle DAC, assuming D is on the extension of AC. Or if D is inside the triangle, it depends.

Alternatively, suppose that D is such that AD is a cevian in triangle ABC, dividing it into smaller triangles. But without more info, it's hard.

But let's try to relate angles. Suppose that angle BAC is composed of angle BAD and angle DAC. So:

angle BAC = angle BAD + angle DAC = 69° + ε.

Similarly, angle BCA (at point C) might be composed of angle BCD (55°) and angle ACD (φ), assuming D is on the same side as A. So:

angle BCA = angle BCD + angle ACD = 55° + φ.

Now, in triangle ABC, angles sum to 180°:

angle BAC + angle ABC + angle BCA = 180°

Substitute:

(69 + ε) + θ + (55 + φ) = 180

Combine terms:

69 + 55 + ε + φ + θ = 180

Which is:

124 + (ε + φ) + θ = 180

But from earlier, ε + φ = 119°, so:

124 + 119 + θ = 180

That gives:

243 + θ = 180 → θ = 180 - 243 = -63°, which is impossible.

This indicates a contradiction, suggesting that our assumption about the composition of angles is wrong.

Perhaps angle BAC is not 69° + ε. Maybe ε is part of angle BAC minus something. Or maybe angle BAC is ε - 69°, depending on the position of D.

Alternatively, if D is on the other side of AB, then angle BAD (69°) could be exterior to angle BAC, making angle BAC = angle BAD - something.

This suggests that without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging to relate these angles correctly. 

Let me think of another approach. Since we have several angles given, maybe using the fact that the sum of angles around point D is 360°, and combining with previous equations.

From earlier, we have:

angle ADB (β) + angle BDC (δ) + angle ADC (61°) = 360° ⇒ β + δ = 299°.

From triangle ABD: β = 111° - α.

From triangle BCD: δ = 125° - γ.

So, β + δ = (111 - α) + (125 - γ) = 236 - (α + γ) = 299° ⇒ α + γ = 236 - 299 = -63°, which is impossible.

This suggests that there's an inconsistency in the given data, or my understanding of the configuration is incorrect.

Wait, the problem states that the answer choices are A-D, so there must be a valid solution. Hence, my error must be in the assumption about the configuration.

Maybe angle ADC is not an angle at D between A and C, but instead is part of a different triangle? Wait, the problem states m∠CDA = 61°, which is angle at D between C and A, so yes, angle ADC.

Alternatively, perhaps the diagram involves overlapping triangles or non-convex configurations. For example, if D is inside the triangle ABC, making some angles reflex. But reflex angles are greater than 180°, which might be possible.

However, in standard problems, angles are typically considered as less than 180°, unless specified otherwise. But if angle ADC is a reflex angle, then it would be greater than 180°, changing the calculation.

Wait, the problem says m∠CDA = 61°, which is likely referring to the non-reflex angle, so it's 61°, not reflex. Hence, the earlier calculation holds.

This suggests that there's a missing piece of information or a misinterpretation of the given predicates.

Let me revisit the original predicates:

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A, B, D)), x): This is angle at B between A and D, so angle ABD.
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B, A, D)), 69): Angle at A between B and D, so angle BAD = 69°.
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B, C, D)), 55): Angle at C between B and D, so angle BCD = 55°.
- Triangle(A, B, C): Triangle ABC.
- Triangle(A, B, D): Triangle ABD.
- Question: Find m∠ABC, which is angle at B between A and C, so angle ABC.

So, angle ABC is what we need to find. Let's try to express angle ABC in terms of other angles.

If we can find angle ABD and angle CBD, and if they are adjacent, then angle ABC = angle ABD + angle CBD.

But earlier attempts showed that this leads to contradictions. So perhaps there's another relation.

Wait, what if angle ABD and angle CBD are not adjacent? For example, if D is on the extension of BC, then angle ABD and angle CBD would be supplementary. But how?

Let me consider that possibility. Suppose D is on the extension of BC beyond C. Then, angle CBD would be a straight line, but angle BCD is given as 55°, which might not fit.

Alternatively, if D is on the extension of AB, but that might not fit the given angles.

Alternatively, perhaps D is such that BD is an altitude or median, but without more info, it's hard to say.

Another idea: Use the Law of Sines in triangles ABD and BCD.

In triangle ABD: 
- angle at A: 69°
- angle at B: α
- angle at D: β = 111° - α

Using Law of Sines: AB/sinβ = BD/sin69° = AD/sinα.

In triangle BCD:
- angle at C: 55°
- angle at B: γ
- angle at D: δ = 125° - γ

Law of Sines: BC/sinδ = BD/sin55° = CD/sinγ.

But without knowing any sides, this might not help directly.

However, if we assume that certain sides are proportional or equal, but there's no info on lengths.

Alternatively, consider triangle ADC. Using Law of Sines:

AD/sinφ = CD/sinε = AC/sin61°.

But again, without knowing sides, it's hard.

Wait, but maybe combining the ratios from triangles ABD and BCD.

From triangle ABD: BD / sin69° = AD / sinα.

From triangle BCD: BD / sin55° = CD / sinγ.

So, BD = (AD * sin69°)/sinα = (CD * sin55°)/sinγ.

Hence, (AD / CD) = (sin69° / sinα) * (sinγ / sin55°).

But without knowing AD/CD or relating α and γ, this might not help.

But if we can relate α and γ through angle ABC.

If angle ABC is made up of α and γ, then α + γ = angle ABC. Wait, but earlier this led to contradiction. Wait, if D is such that BD is splitting angle ABC into α (ABD) and γ (CBD), then angle ABC = α + γ.

But earlier, from the angles around D, we had α + γ = -63°, which is impossible. So this suggests that either the problem is ill-posed, or there's a different relationship.

Wait, perhaps angle ABC is not α + γ, but α - γ or something else. For example, if D is on the other side of AB, then α and γ might be on opposite sides, and angle ABC is |α - γ|.

But this is speculation. Let me try assuming that angle ABC = α - γ, and see if that helps.

From the earlier equation, α + γ = -63°, but if angle ABC = α - γ, then we have two equations:

α + γ = -63°
α - γ = θ (angle ABC)

Adding these equations: 2α = -63 + θ → α = (-63 + θ)/2

Subtracting: 2γ = -63 - θ → γ = (-63 - θ)/2

But without additional constraints, this doesn't help.

Alternatively, if angle ABC = γ - α, then:

γ - α = θ

And from α + γ = -63°, we can solve:

γ = θ + α

Substitute into α + γ = -63°:

α + θ + α = -63° → 2α + θ = -63°

Still, too many variables.

This suggests that without more information, it's impossible to resolve the contradiction, implying that my initial assumption about the configuration is wrong.

Let me try a different approach, using the given answer choices. The options are 55, 69, 85, 140. Let's see if any of these make sense.

If angle ABC is 69°, which is the same as angle BAD. Could that mean that points are arranged such that angle ABC equals angle BAD? Maybe if D is placed such that triangles ABD and ABC are similar or something. But this is too vague.

Alternatively, if angle ABC is 85°, which is 69 + 16, or 55 + 30. Not sure.

Wait, let's think about the angles in triangle ADC. We know angle ADC = 61°, and if we can find other angles, maybe relate to other triangles.

In triangle ADC, angle at D is 61°, and angles at A and C are ε and φ, summing to 119°. If we can find ε or φ, maybe relate to other angles.

If we consider that ε is part of angle BAC, and φ is part of angle BCA.

Previously, we tried to write angle BAC = 69 + ε, angle BCA = 55 + φ, leading to contradiction. But what if instead, ε is part of angle BAC, and φ is part of angle BCA, but with some subtraction?

For example, if D is inside the triangle, then angle BAC = 69° - ε, or something like that.

Let me try this. Assume that angle BAC = 69° - ε, and angle BCA = 55° - φ. Then:

angle BAC + angle ABC + angle BCA = (69 - ε) + θ + (55 - φ) = 124 + θ - (ε + φ) = 180.

But ε + φ = 119°, so:

124 + θ - 119 = 180 → 5 + θ = 180 → θ = 175°, which is not among the options. So this is invalid.

Another idea: What if angle BAC = ε - 69°, and angle BCA = φ - 55°? Then:

(ε - 69) + θ + (φ - 55) = ε + φ - 124 + θ = 119 - 124 + θ = -5 + θ = 180 → θ = 185°, also not possible.

This suggests that my assumptions about the relationships between angles are flawed.

Perhaps I should consider that angle ABC is supplementary to some angle. For example, if angle ABC + something = 180°.

Alternatively, recall that in triangle ADC, angle ADC = 61°, and if we can find other angles in triangle ADC, maybe via other triangles.

Wait, let's think about the sum of angles in triangle ADC: 61 + ε + φ = 180 → ε + φ = 119.

Also, in triangle ABD, angle ABD = α, and in triangle BCD, angle CBD = γ. If angle ABC = α + γ, then from earlier, α + γ = -63°, which is impossible. But if instead, angle ABC = |α - γ|, then we have |α - γ| = θ. But without knowing the sign, it's unclear.

Wait, what if angle ABC is actually α - γ, and we have α - γ = θ, and from the earlier equation α + γ = -63°. Solving these two equations:

From α - γ = θ and α + γ = -63, adding them gives 2α = θ - 63 → α = (θ - 63)/2.

Subtracting gives 2γ = -63 - θ → γ = (-63 - θ)/2.

But without additional constraints, this doesn't help.

However, if we consider that angles cannot be negative, then for γ ≥ 0, (-63 - θ)/2 ≥ 0 → -63 - θ ≥ 0 → θ ≤ -63°, which is impossible. Hence, this approach is invalid.

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to reconsider the entire setup.

Let me try drawing a rough diagram mentally. Let's assume points A, B, C, D such that:

- A and B are connected.
- D is a point such that triangles ABD and BCD exist.
- Angle at A (BAD) is 69°, angle at C (BCD) is 55°, and angle at D (ADC) is 61°.

Maybe D is such that AD and CD form a triangle with angle 61° at D, and BD connects to B.

If I consider triangle ADC with angle 61° at D, and try to relate it to triangles ABD and BCD.

Let me try to use the fact that the sum of angles around D is 360°, and the other angles from the triangles.

From earlier, we had:

angle ADB + angle BDC + 61° = 360° → angle ADB + angle BDC = 299°.

From triangle ABD: angle ADB = 111° - angle ABD.

From triangle BCD: angle BDC = 125° - angle CBD.

So, 111 - angle ABD + 125 - angle CBD = 299 → 236 - (angle ABD + angle CBD) = 299 → angle ABD + angle CBD = 236 - 299 = -63°.

This is impossible, so the only way this can be resolved is if one of the angles is reflex (greater than 180°). For example, if angle ADB or angle BDC is reflex.

Let's assume that one of the angles at D is reflex. Suppose angle ADB is reflex, so it's greater than 180°, making the sum angle ADB + angle BDC = 299° possible.

Let me redefine: Let angle ADB be a reflex angle, say 180° + x, and angle BDC = y, such that (180 + x) + y = 299 → x + y = 119°.

From triangle ABD, angle ADB = 180 + x, so the sum of angles in triangle ABD would be:

69° + angle ABD + (180 + x) = 180 → 69 + angle ABD + 180 + x = 180 → angle ABD + x = -69°, which is impossible since angles can't be negative.

Alternatively, if angle BDC is reflex. Let angle BDC = 180 + y, and angle ADB = z, so z + (180 + y) = 299 → z + y = 119°.

From triangle BCD, angle BDC = 180 + y, so the sum of angles in triangle BCD is 55° + angle CBD + (180 + y) = 180 → 55 + angle CBD + 180 + y = 180 → angle CBD + y = -55°, also impossible.

Thus, even with reflex angles, this approach fails.

This suggests that the given problem may have a typo or requires a different interpretation of the angle notations.

Wait, let me double-check the original problem statement. It says "m∠CDA = 61". Is this angle at D, between C and A? Yes, which is angle ADC, as previously.

Wait, perhaps the angle is not at D but at C? No, the notation ∠CDA means the angle at D, between C and A.

Alternatively, could it be a different angle? Like ∠CDA is angle at D, but maybe the problem meant angle at C? No, standard notation is ∠XYZ is angle at Y.

So, the problem is consistent in that regard.

At this point, I'm stuck and need to consider that perhaps there's a simpler relationship I'm missing.

Let me try to look for a direct relationship between the given angles.

We have angle BAD = 69°, angle BCD = 55°, angle ADC = 61°.

If I consider quadrilateral ABCD, the sum of its interior angles is (4-2)*180 = 360°. But we know three of the angles: at A, B, C, D?

Wait, no, we only know angle at D (61°), and possibly others if we can derive them.

But in a quadrilateral, the sum of all four angles is 360°. Let's assume ABCD is a quadrilateral. Then, the sum of angles at A, B, C, D is 360°.

We know angle at D is 61°. What about the others?

Angle at A: in quadrilateral ABCD, it would be angle DAB, which is given as 69° (angle BAD).

Angle at B: angle ABC, which we need to find.

Angle at C: angle BCD is 55°, but in the quadrilateral, angle at C would be angle BCD or something else? If the quadrilateral is ABCD, then angle at C is angle BCD or angle ACB? Depends on the shape.

Wait, in a quadrilateral ABCD, the angles are at each vertex: at A, B, C, D. So:

- Angle at A: angle DAB = 69°
- Angle at B: angle ABC = ?
- Angle at C: angle BCD = 55°?
- Angle at D: angle CDA = 61°

Wait, if that's the case, then the sum of these four angles would be 69 + angle ABC + 55 + 61 = 185 + angle ABC = 360° → angle ABC = 360 - 185 = 175°, which is not an option. So this suggests that ABCD is not a simple quadrilateral, or the angles are not as assumed.

But why would angle at C be 55°? Because angle BCD is part of triangle BCD, which might not be the same as the angle at C in the quadrilateral. For example, if D is inside the quadrilateral, then angle at C might be split into two angles: BCD and something else.

Thus, assuming that the angle at C in the quadrilateral is 55° is incorrect. Hence, this approach is invalid.

Another idea: Use the fact that the sum of angles in triangle ADC is 180°, and in triangle ABD and BCD.

But without knowing more, it's hard.

Wait, let me try to consider that angle ABC is the supplement of some angle. For example, if angle ABC + angle ABD = 180°, but this is just guessing.

Alternatively, let's consider that in triangle ABD, angle ABD is x, and in triangle BCD, angle CBD is y, and angle ABC = x - y or y - x.

If we assume angle ABC = x - y, and from earlier, x + y = -63°, then x - y = θ, and x + y = -63. Solving these:

Adding: 2x = θ - 63 → x = (θ - 63)/2

Subtracting: 2y = -63 - θ → y = (-63 - θ)/2

But without additional constraints, this doesn't help.

However, if we assume that x and y are positive, then:

For x > 0: (θ - 63)/2 > 0 → θ > 63°

For y > 0: (-63 - θ)/2 > 0 → -63 - θ > 0 → θ < -63°, which is impossible.

Thus, this is invalid.

At this point, I've exhausted various approaches without success, which suggests that there might be a misunderstanding in the problem setup. Given the time spent and the need to choose from the options, let me try to see if any of the options satisfy the conditions when plugged into the earlier contradictory equation.

From earlier, we had:

angle ABD + angle CBD = -63°.

If we assume that this is due to a miscalculation, and that the actual value is 63°, perhaps due to a sign error. For example, if the correct sum is 63°, then angle ABD + angle CBD = 63°, and since angle ABC is this sum, then angle ABC = 63°, but 63° is not an option. Closest is 69° or 55°.

Alternatively, if the correct sum is 180 - 63 = 117°, then angle ABC = 117°, which is not an option.

Alternatively, if the correct sum is 63°, and there's a miscalculation in the earlier steps, perhaps the correct answer is 69°, which is one of the options.

But this is pure guesswork. Given the options, and the presence of 69°, which is one of the given angles, and the lack of other viable options, I'll hazard a guess that the correct answer is B. 69°.

But this feels uncertain. Alternatively, if angle ABC is 85°, which is 69 + 16, or 55 + 30, but no clear reason.

Wait, let me think: if angle ADC is 61°, and in triangle ADC, angles at A and C sum to 119°. If angle at A (DAC) is 69°, then angle at C (ACD) would be 119 - 69 = 50°. Then, in triangle BCD, angle at C is 55°, which might relate to angle ACD (50°). If angle BCD is 55°, and angle ACD is 50°, then the remaining angle
