====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a triangle ABC with some given angles and a side length. The question is asking for the length of side 'a' when c is 5. Let me start by breaking down the given information.

First, the predicates mention RightAngle(Angle(A,C,B)). Wait, that means angle at point C? Because Angle(A,C,B) would be the angle at point C between points A and B. But it says it's a right angle. So triangle ABC has a right angle at C. Hmm, but wait, there are also angle measures given. Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,A)),60). Let me parse that. Angle(C,B,A) is the angle at point B between points C and A. So that's angle B, which is 60 degrees. Then Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,C)),30). That's angle at A between points B and C, so angle A is 30 degrees. 

So putting that together, triangle ABC has angles at A=30°, B=60°, and since it's a triangle, angle C should be 90° because the sum is 180. Wait, but the first predicate said RightAngle(Angle(A,C,B)), which is angle C. So yes, angle C is 90°, making it a right-angled triangle at C. 

Now, the sides mentioned: IsSideOf(Line(C,B),Triangle(A,B,C)) – so CB is a side. Similarly, AC and AB are sides. So the triangle has sides AB, BC, and AC. The given side is c = 5. Wait, in standard triangle notation, side a is opposite angle A, side b opposite angle B, and side c opposite angle C. Wait, but here they refer to Line(C,B) as a side, which is CB. So in standard terms, side opposite angle A is BC, which would be side a? Or maybe I need to clarify.

Wait, standard notation: In triangle ABC, side a is BC (opposite angle A), side b is AC (opposite angle B), and side c is AB (opposite angle C). Wait, but angle C is the right angle here. So if angle C is 90°, then side AB is the hypotenuse. So in this case, side c is AB, which is opposite angle C. Wait, but the problem states that c = 5. So AB = 5. But the question asks for 'a', which is BC. Wait, but let me confirm.

Alternatively, sometimes different notations are used. Maybe the user refers to side a as BC, side b as AC, and side c as AB. Let me check again. The given IsSideOf(Line(C,B),Triangle(A,B,C)) implies that CB is one side. Similarly, AC and AB are sides. So the three sides are AB, BC, and AC. Now, in standard triangle notation, each side is named by the opposite vertex. So side a is BC (opposite angle A), side b is AC (opposite angle B), and side c is AB (opposite angle C). Since angle C is the right angle, AB is the hypotenuse. Therefore, if c = 5, that would mean AB = 5. And the question is to find a, which is BC.

But let me verify the angles again. Angles at A is 30°, angle B is 60°, angle C is 90°. So triangle with angles 30-60-90. In such a triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. Specifically, the side opposite 30° is the shortest one, then opposite 60°, then hypotenuse. Here, angle A is 30°, so side BC (which is opposite angle A) is the shortest side. Then side AC (opposite angle B, 60°) is longer, and hypotenuse AB is opposite the right angle C. 

Given that AB = c = 5. So hypotenuse is 5. In a 30-60-90 triangle, hypotenuse is twice the shorter leg. The shorter leg is opposite 30°, which is BC (side a). So BC = (AB)/2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5. Therefore, a = 2.5. Looking at the options, that's option A. 

Wait, but let me make sure about the labeling. Suppose angle A is 30°, angle B is 60°, angle C is 90°. Then side opposite angle A (BC) is a, side opposite angle B (AC) is b, and hypotenuse AB is c. So yes, c is the hypotenuse. Therefore, if c = 5, then a = c / 2 = 2.5. Hence, the answer should be A. 

Another way to think: Using trigonometry. For example, sin(30°) = opposite over hypotenuse. So sin(30°) = BC / AB. Sin(30°) is 0.5, so BC = AB * 0.5 = 5 * 0.5 = 2.5. Same result. So answer is A.
