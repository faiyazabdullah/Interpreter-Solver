Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's given and what's being asked. 

So, the problem states that there's a triangle ABC, and it mentions a right angle at Angle(A,C,B). Wait, that notation might mean the angle at point C between points A, C, and B? Or maybe it's written differently. Let me parse that again. RightAngle(Angle(A,C,B))—so the angle is formed by points A, C, B. So vertex at C, with segments AC and CB forming the angle. Therefore, triangle ABC has a right angle at C. That means triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at C.

Then, we have the lengths of the sides: LengthOf(Line(A,C)) is 24, LengthOf(Line(A,B)) is 26, and LengthOf(Line(B,C)) is 10. Wait, but if the right angle is at C, then the legs would be AC and BC, and AB would be the hypotenuse. But according to the given lengths, AC is 24, BC is 10, so AB should be the hypotenuse. Let me check if those numbers satisfy the Pythagorean theorem. 

Calculating 24 squared plus 10 squared equals 576 + 100 = 676. And 26 squared is 676. Oh, perfect! So that checks out. So triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at C, with legs AC=24, BC=10, and hypotenuse AB=26.

Now, the question asks for the ratio of cos B as a decimal to the nearest hundredth. So, angle B is one of the acute angles in the triangle. To find cosine of angle B, I recall that in a right-angled triangle, cosine of an angle is adjacent over hypotenuse. 

But first, I need to figure out which sides are adjacent and opposite relative to angle B. Let me visualize the triangle. Since the right angle is at C, the vertices are A, B, and C with right angle at C. So, angle B is at vertex B. In triangle ABC, angle B is at point B. 

In such a triangle, the sides adjacent to angle B would be the side connecting B to C (which is BC) and the hypotenuse AB. Wait, no—the adjacent side is the one that forms the angle along with the hypotenuse. Let me think again. For angle B, the sides involved are BC (from B to C), BA (hypotenuse), and the other leg is AB? No, wait. Let me clarify.

In a right-angled triangle, each acute angle's cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse. For angle B, the adjacent side is the one that forms the angle along with the hypotenuse. So, angle B is at point B. The sides connected to B are BC and BA. The side BC is one leg (length 10), BA is the hypotenuse (length 26). Wait, but the adjacent side would be the leg adjacent to angle B, which is BC. Because the hypotenuse is always opposite the right angle. Wait, perhaps I should draw the triangle mentally.

Let me label the triangle properly. Right angle at C, so points A, C, B. So, AC is one leg (length 24), BC is another leg (length 10), and AB is the hypotenuse (length 26). Now, angle B is at point B. So, looking at angle B, the two sides forming it are BC (from B to C) and BA (from B to A). Therefore, the adjacent side to angle B is BC (since it's next to angle B), and the hypotenuse is AB. So, cos B = adjacent / hypotenuse = BC / AB. Wait, but BC is length 10, AB is 26. So cos B would be 10/26. Let me compute that. 10 divided by 26 equals approximately 0.3846... Rounded to the nearest hundredth is 0.38. Which would correspond to answer choice A.

Wait, but hold on—is that correct? Let me double-check. Alternatively, could angle B be adjacent to a different side?

Alternatively, sometimes people get confused about which angle is which. Another way is to use coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to the triangle. Let’s place point C at the origin (0,0), since the right angle is there. Then, since AC is 24 units long, and assuming AC is horizontal, point A would be at (24, 0). Point B is at (0, 10), because BC is 10 units vertical. Then AB connects (24,0) to (0,10). The coordinates make sense. Now, angle B is at (0,10). So, vectors BA and BC form angle B. Vector BA goes from B to A: (24-0, 0-10) = (24, -10). Vector BC goes from B to C: (0-0, 0-10) = (0, -10). To find cos B, we can use the dot product formula. Cosine of the angle between vectors BA and BC is equal to their dot product divided by the product of their magnitudes.

So, vector BA is (24, -10), vector BC is (0, -10). Their dot product is (24)(0) + (-10)(-10) = 0 + 100 = 100. The magnitude of BA is sqrt(24² + (-10)^2) = sqrt(576 + 100) = sqrt(676) = 26. The magnitude of BC is sqrt(0^2 + (-10)^2) = 10. Therefore, cos(theta) = 100/(26*10) = 100/260 = 10/26 ≈ 0.3846, which rounds to 0.38. So that confirms my earlier calculation. Therefore, the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me check once more. Another approach: in a right-angled triangle, cos(angle) = adjacent/hypotenuse. For angle B, the adjacent side is BC (length 10), and the hypotenuse is AB (26). So yes, cos B = 10/26 ≈ 0.3846 → 0.38. So answer A.

Looking at the options, A is 0.38, which matches. So the answer is A.
