Okay, let's try to figure out how to find y here. So we have these perpendicular lines and some right angles. Let me start by visualizing the points and lines based on the given predicates.

First, the problem mentions several lines and points. Let me note down all the given information:

1. Perpendicular(Line(C,D), Line(A,B)): So line CD is perpendicular to AB.
2. Perpendicular(Line(B,D), Line(A,C)): Line BD is perpendicular to AC.
3. RightAngle(Angle(C,D,A)): So angle at point D between points C, D, A is a right angle.
4. RightAngle(Angle(B,D,C)): Angle at D between B, D, C is also a right angle.
5. Length of CB is 8.5 units.
6. Length of AC is 8.8 units.
7. Need to find length of DB, which is y.

Hmm. Let me sketch this mentally. Points A, B, C, D. Let me think about how they connect. 

From the perpendicularity conditions. Since CD is perpendicular to AB, and BD is perpendicular to AC. Also, there are two right angles at D: one involving CDA and another involving BDC. Wait, maybe D is a common point where these perpendiculars meet?

Let me consider coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to each point would help. Let me place point D at the origin (0,0) since there are right angles at D. Then, because CD is perpendicular to AB, and BD is perpendicular to AC.

Wait, if I set up coordinate system with D at (0,0). Let me assume line CD is along the y-axis and line BD along the x-axis? Because they're perpendicular to each other? Wait, but BD is perpendicular to AC, and CD is perpendicular to AB. Hmm, perhaps I need to assign coordinates carefully.

Alternatively, since there are right angles at D, maybe D is the intersection point of two perpendicular lines. Let me think: angle CDA is a right angle, so CD and DA are perpendicular. Similarly, angle BDC is a right angle, so BD and DC are perpendicular. Therefore, BD is perpendicular to DC, and CD is perpendicular to DA. Which implies that BD is parallel to DA? Wait, no. If CD is perpendicular to both BD and DA, then BD and DA are both perpendicular to CD, hence BD and DA are parallel? But that may not necessarily hold unless they are in same direction. Wait, but since both BD and DA are perpendicular to CD, they must lie along the same line? Or opposite directions?

Wait, angle CDA is a right angle. So at point D, lines DC and DA form a right angle. Similarly, angle BDC is a right angle, so at D, lines DB and DC form a right angle. Therefore, DC is perpendicular to both DA and DB. That means DA and DB are both perpendicular to DC, implying DA is parallel to DB? Wait, but if two lines are both perpendicular to the same line, they are parallel. However, in this case, DA and DB are two different lines emanating from D, both perpendicular to DC. So they must be colinear? Wait, that can't be unless DA and DB are the same line, which would mean points A and B are on the same line through D. But that seems conflicting with other info.

Wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Let me re-examine the angles. 

RightAngle(Angle(C,D,A)) means that at point D, the angle between points C, D, A is a right angle. So angle CDA is formed by DC and DA. Similarly, RightAngle(Angle(B,D,C)) means at point D, the angle between B, D, C is a right angle. So angle BDC is formed by DB and DC. Thus, DC is perpendicular to both DA and DB. Therefore, DA and DB are both perpendicular to DC, so DA and DB are parallel to each other. Hence, DA || DB. But since both DA and DB originate from D, this would imply that DA and DB are in the same line? Wait, no. If two lines are both perpendicular to the same line, they are either parallel or antiparallel. But since both DA and DB are starting from D, they can't be in the same line unless A and B are on the same line. 

This suggests that DA and DB are in opposite directions relative to DC. For example, suppose DC is vertical. Then DA could be horizontal to the left, and DB horizontal to the right, making them both perpendicular to DC. So DA and DB are in opposite directions. 

So, if I take D as the origin (0,0), and DC as the positive y-axis. Then DA would be along the negative x-axis, and DB along the positive x-axis. Wait, but then DC is along y-axis, DA is along negative x-axis, and DB is along positive x-axis. Then, points:

- Point D: (0,0)
- Point C: somewhere along positive y-axis, say (0, c)
- Point A: along negative x-axis, say (-a, 0)
- Point B: along positive x-axis, say (b, 0)

Now, check the other perpendicularity condition: Perpendicular(Line(B,D), Line(A,C)). Line BD is from B(b,0) to D(0,0), so it's along the x-axis from (0,0) to (b,0). Line AC connects A(-a,0) to C(0,c). The slope of AC would be (c - 0)/(0 - (-a)) = c/a. Line BD is horizontal (slope 0). Wait, but BD is supposed to be perpendicular to AC. For BD (slope 0) to be perpendicular to AC (slope c/a), their slopes' product should be -1. But 0 multiplied by anything is 0, which isn't -1. Contradiction. So something's wrong here. 

Ah! So my assumption that DA is along negative x-axis and DB along positive x-axis leads to inconsistency. Therefore, my coordinate setup is incorrect. Let me rethink.

Alternative approach: Since BD is perpendicular to AC, and CD is perpendicular to AB. Let me use vectors or coordinate geometry properly.

Let me denote coordinates again. Let me place D at (0,0). Since angle CDA is a right angle, so DC ⊥ DA. Let me assume DC is along positive y-axis, so point C is (0, k) for some k. Then DA is along x-axis (since DC is vertical, DA must be horizontal). So point A is (m, 0). Now, angle BDC is a right angle, so DB ⊥ DC. Since DC is vertical, DB must be horizontal. Therefore, point B lies along horizontal line from D(0,0). So point B is (n, 0). Wait, but then points A and B are both on x-axis? But then line AB would be along x-axis. And line CD is vertical. So line CD is perpendicular to AB, which is consistent with first predicate. 

But then BD is the segment from B(n,0) to D(0,0), which is horizontal. Line AC connects A(m,0) to C(0,k). The slope of AC is (k - 0)/(0 - m) = -k/m. BD is horizontal, slope 0. For BD to be perpendicular to AC, their slopes must multiply to -1. So 0 * (-k/m) = 0 ≠ -1. Contradiction again. 

Hmm, so this suggests that my coordinate assignments are flawed. Where's the mistake here?

Wait, the second predicate says Perpendicular(Line(B,D), Line(A,C)). So BD is perpendicular to AC. In my current setup, BD is horizontal, AC has slope -k/m. Their slopes multiply to zero, which is not -1. So contradiction. Therefore, my coordinate assignment is invalid.

Alternative idea: Perhaps DA is not along x-axis. Let me adjust. Suppose DC is vertical (along y-axis), and DA is along some direction such that DC ⊥ DA. So DA can be any direction perpendicular to DC. So if DC is vertical, DA can be horizontal. Wait, but earlier attempt shows inconsistency. Alternatively, maybe DA is not horizontal? Wait, if DC is vertical, then DA must be horizontal to be perpendicular. So DA is horizontal. Then BD must be perpendicular to DC, so BD is horizontal. So BD is horizontal, same as DA. So BD and DA are both horizontal, same line? So points A and B are on same horizontal line through D. But then line AB is horizontal. Line CD is vertical. So AB ⊥ CD, which satisfies first predicate. Then BD is horizontal, AC is from A (say (a,0)) to C (0, c). Slope of AC is (c - 0)/(0 - a) = -c/a. BD is horizontal, slope 0. Again, same problem. Not perpendicular. 

Therefore, there's a conflict here. What's wrong?

Wait, maybe DC is not vertical. Maybe I need to assign coordinates differently. Let me try again. Let me consider that since BD is perpendicular to AC, and CD is perpendicular to AB. Let me consider that AB and CD are perpendicular, and AC and BD are perpendicular. Also, there are two right angles at D: angle CDA and angle BDC. So, at D, DC is connected to DA and DB. 

Let me think of D as the origin. Let me define vectors. Let vector DC be some vector, say vector u, and vector DA be vector v. Since angle CDA is right, vectors DC and DA are perpendicular: u · v = 0. Also, angle BDC is right, so vectors DC and DB are perpendicular. So vector DB is also perpendicular to DC. Therefore, vectors DA and DB are both perpendicular to DC. Hence, DA and DB are parallel to each other. Wait, but they both start at D, so they must be scalar multiples of each other. So DA and DB are colinear? That would mean points A and B lie on the same line through D. But then AB would be a straight line passing through D. However, line CD is perpendicular to AB, which would make CD perpendicular to AB. Also, BD is perpendicular to AC. 

This seems complicated. Maybe using coordinates with D at origin, DC as y-axis, DA and DB along x-axis but in opposite directions. Let me try again. 

Set D at (0,0). Let’s take DC as vertical, so C is (0, c). DA is horizontal, so A is (a, 0). Since angle BDC is right, DB must be horizontal as well. So B is (b, 0). Now, line AB connects A(a, 0) to B(b, 0), which is horizontal. Line CD connects C(0,c) to D(0,0), vertical. So AB ⊥ CD, which satisfies the first perpendicularity. Now, line AC connects A(a,0) to C(0,c). Its slope is (c - 0)/(0 - a) = -c/a. Line BD connects B(b,0) to D(0,0), which is horizontal. For BD to be perpendicular to AC, the product of their slopes must be -1. BD has slope 0, so this is impossible. Hence, contradiction again. 

What's the issue here? It seems like the problem arises from assuming both DA and DB are horizontal. But according to the given, BD is perpendicular to AC. So if BD is horizontal, then AC must be vertical, but AC connects A(a,0) to C(0,c), which is not vertical unless a=0, which would collapse points. 

Alternative approach: Perhaps DC is not aligned with axes. Let me instead assign coordinates more generally. Let me denote D as (0,0). Let me assume that DC is a vector (p, q), and DA is a vector (r, s) such that DC · DA = 0 (since they are perpendicular). Also, DB is another vector (t, u) such that DC · DB = 0 (since angle BDC is right). So DB is also perpendicular to DC. Hence, DA and DB are both perpendicular to DC, meaning they are scalar multiples of each other. So DA = k * DB for some scalar k. Thus, points A and B lie along the same line through D, but in opposite directions depending on the scalar. 

However, line AC is from A to C, and BD is from B to D. For BD to be perpendicular to AC, their dot product must be zero. 

Let me write equations. Let me assign variables:

Let me define:

Point D: (0, 0).

Vector DC: from D(0,0) to C(x_c, y_c). So C is (x_c, y_c).

Vector DA: from D(0,0) to A(x_a, y_a). Since DC · DA = 0 → x_c * x_a + y_c * y_a = 0.

Similarly, Vector DB: from D(0,0) to B(x_b, y_b). Since DC · DB = 0 → x_c * x_b + y_c * y_b = 0.

Also, BD is the line from B to D, which is the vector from B to D: (-x_b, -y_b). This line BD needs to be perpendicular to line AC. 

Line AC goes from A(x_a, y_a) to C(x_c, y_c). The direction vector of AC is (x_c - x_a, y_c - y_a). 

For BD to be perpendicular to AC, their dot product must be zero. 

So vector BD is (-x_b, -y_b). Direction vector of AC is (x_c - x_a, y_c - y_a). Their dot product is:

(-x_b)(x_c - x_a) + (-y_b)(y_c - y_a) = 0

Which simplifies to:

-x_b x_c + x_b x_a - y_b y_c + y_b y_a = 0

Rearranged:

x_b x_a + y_b y_a = x_b x_c + y_b y_c

But from earlier, since DC · DA = x_c x_a + y_c y_a = 0. And DC · DB = x_c x_b + y_c y_b = 0.

Substituting these into the equation above:

Left side: x_b x_a + y_b y_a = ?

But from DC · DA = 0 → x_c x_a + y_c y_a = 0 → x_a y_c = -x_c y_a.

Wait, not sure yet. Let me substitute. 

We know that x_c x_a + y_c y_a = 0 → x_c x_a = -y_c y_a.

Similarly, x_c x_b + y_c y_b = 0 → x_c x_b = -y_c y_b.

So substituting back into the previous equation:

x_b x_a + y_b y_a = x_b x_c + y_b y_c → 

Replace x_b x_c with -y_c y_b (from DC · DB):

x_b x_c = -y_c y_b → So x_b x_c = -y_c y_b.

Thus:

Left side: x_b x_a + y_b y_a

Right side: x_b x_c + y_b y_c = -y_c y_b + y_b y_c = 0?

Wait, wait:

Original substitution:

x_b x_a + y_b y_a = x_b x_c + y_b y_c

But x_b x_c = -y_c y_b (from DC · DB = 0), so substituting:

x_b x_a + y_b y_a = (-y_c y_b) + y_b y_c = 0.

Therefore, x_b x_a + y_b y_a = 0.

But also, from DC · DA = 0 → x_c x_a + y_c y_a = 0.

So now, we have two equations:

1. x_c x_a + y_c y_a = 0
2. x_b x_a + y_b y_a = 0

Which implies that the vectors (x_c, y_c) and (x_b, y_b) are both orthogonal to the vector (x_a, y_a). This means that (x_a, y_a) is orthogonal to both DC and DB. So, (x_a, y_a) is orthogonal to DC and DB, which are themselves orthogonal to each other (since DC · DB = 0). Wait, no—wait, DC and DB are both orthogonal to DA. So DC and DB are in the same plane, both perpendicular to DA. So DC and DB are parallel to each other? Or they can be in different directions?

Wait, if two vectors are both perpendicular to the same vector, they are either parallel or antiparallel. So DC and DB are parallel. Hence, DC and DB are parallel vectors. So lines DC and DB are parallel. But DC is from D to C, and DB is from D to B. So points C and B lie along the same line through D, but in opposite directions? Or same direction?

Wait, if DC and DB are parallel, then their direction vectors are scalar multiples. So, for instance, if DC is (p, q), then DB is (kp, kq) for some scalar k. So points B and C lie along the same line through D, but scaled by k. 

But this seems to complicate things. Let me see if I can relate the lengths. 

Given that length CB is 8.5. So distance between C and B is 8.5. Let me express coordinates of C and B. Since DC is vector (p, q), and DB is vector (kp, kq). So point C is (p, q), point B is (kp, kq). Then, the distance between C and B is sqrt[(kp - p)^2 + (kq - q)^2] = sqrt[(p(k-1))^2 + (q(k-1))^2] = |k-1| * sqrt(p² + q²). Given this equals 8.5.

Also, length AC is 8.8. Point A is (x_a, y_a), which is orthogonal to DC (vector (p,q)). So x_a p + y_a q = 0. Also, length AC is distance between A and C: sqrt[(p - x_a)^2 + (q - y_a)^2] = 8.8.

Additionally, length DB is y, which is the distance from D(0,0) to B(kp, kq): sqrt((kp)^2 + (kq)^2) = |k| * sqrt(p² + q²). Let me denote sqrt(p² + q²) as some value, say m. Then, distance CB is |k-1|m = 8.5, and distance DB is |k|m = y. Also, distance AC is 8.8.

But without knowing k or m, it's hard to proceed. However, maybe there's another relation. 

Let me recall that DA is vector (x_a, y_a), which is orthogonal to DC (p, q). So (x_a, y_a) is perpendicular to (p, q). Also, the length of DA can be found via sqrt(x_a² + y_a²). Let me call this n. 

Then, since AC is from A(x_a, y_a) to C(p, q), its length squared is (p - x_a)^2 + (q - y_a)^2 = p² - 2p x_a + x_a² + q² - 2q y_a + y_a² = (p² + q²) + (x_a² + y_a²) - 2(p x_a + q y_a). But since p x_a + q y_a = 0 (because DC · DA = 0), this becomes (p² + q²) + (x_a² + y_a²) = m² + n². Therefore, length AC squared is m² + n², and given that length AC is 8.8, so m² + n² = 8.8² = 77.44.

Now, we also have distance CB is |k - 1| m = 8.5, and distance DB is |k| m = y. So, if I can relate these equations.

But we don't know k or m. However, we might need more relations. Let me think about the other given lengths. We also have length of CB is 8.5, and length of AC is 8.8. But how does that help us?

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express y in terms of other variables. Let me think. From the distance CB: |k - 1| m = 8.5. From DB: |k| m = y. So if I can find k, I can relate y and m. But I need another equation. 

From the expression of AC squared: m² + n² = 8.8². But n is the length of DA, which is sqrt(x_a² + y_a²). However, we don't have information about DA directly. Unless there's another relationship.

Wait, what about the length of DA? Is there any given length related to DA? No, except possibly through other relationships. 

Alternatively, since DA is perpendicular to DC, and DB is also perpendicular to DC, and thus DA and DB are parallel. So DA and DB are parallel vectors. So the ratio between DA and DB depends on k. 

But I'm stuck here. Let me think differently. Maybe using coordinate-free geometry. 

Since DC is perpendicular to both DA and DB, then DA and DB are both perpendicular to DC. Hence, DA and DB are parallel. Therefore, points A and B lie along a line perpendicular to DC. Let me imagine DC as vertical, so DA and DB are horizontal. Then, points A and B are horizontally aligned with D. 

Wait, but earlier attempts showed contradictions with the perpendicularity of BD and AC. Let me try once more with this setup. 

Let me set DC as vertical. So D is (0,0), C is (0, c). DA is horizontal, so A is (a, 0). DB is horizontal, so B is (b, 0). Then line AC is from (a,0) to (0,c). Line BD is from B(b,0) to D(0,0). For BD to be perpendicular to AC, their slopes must multiply to -1. 

Slope of AC: (c - 0)/(0 - a) = -c/a. Slope of BD: (0 - 0)/(0 - b) = 0. Wait, slope of BD is zero, so it's horizontal. So for BD to be perpendicular to AC, the slope of AC must be undefined (vertical), but it's -c/a. Only if a approaches infinity, which isn't helpful. Hence, contradiction again. 

So this suggests that the only way for BD to be perpendicular to AC is if AC is vertical. But AC is from A(a,0) to C(0,c). To make AC vertical, the x-coordinate must stay constant. So a must be 0, which would put A at (0,0), same as D. Not allowed. 

This indicates that there's a fundamental flaw in my assumptions. Perhaps the configuration is not planar? Or perhaps the points are arranged differently. 

Wait, maybe the lines aren't intersecting at D? No, the angles are at D. So all lines pass through D. 

Alternative idea: Perhaps D is not between A and B or C and others. Maybe the lines extend beyond D. Let me think. For example, line AB passes through D, with A and B on opposite sides of D. Similarly for line CD. 

Let me try setting D at origin again. Let me assume line AB passes through D, with A and B on opposite sides. So A is (-a, 0), B is (b, 0), D is (0,0). Line CD is perpendicular to AB, so CD is vertical. So C is (0, c). Now, line AC connects A(-a, 0) to C(0, c). Line BD connects B(b, 0) to D(0,0). For BD to be perpendicular to AC, the slope of BD times slope of AC should be -1. 

Slope of BD: (0-0)/(0-b) = 0. Slope of AC: (c - 0)/(0 - (-a)) = c/a. Product is 0 * c/a = 0 ≠ -1. Still contradiction. 

Wait, this suggests that the only way for BD to be perpendicular to AC is if AC is vertical, which requires a = 0, leading to A coinciding with D. Not possible. 

Is there any possibility that BD is not horizontal? Maybe my assumption that DC is vertical is causing issues. Let me try a different orientation. 

Suppose DC is not vertical. Let me assign coordinates where DC is arbitrary, and derive relations. Let me denote D as (0,0), C as (c_x, c_y), A as (a_x, a_y), B as (b_x, b_y). 

Given:

1. CD ⊥ AB: The vector CD is (c_x, c_y), vector AB is (b_x - a_x, b_y - a_y). Their dot product is c_x(b_x - a_x) + c_y(b_y - a_y) = 0.

2. BD ⊥ AC: Vector BD is (b_x, b_y), vector AC is (c_x - a_x, c_y - a_y). Dot product: b_x(c_x - a_x) + b_y(c_y - a_y) = 0.

3. Angle CDA is right: Vector DC is (c_x, c_y), vector DA is (a_x, a_y). Their dot product is c_x a_x + c_y a_y = 0.

4. Angle BDC is right: Vector DC is (c_x, c_y), vector DB is (b_x, b_y). Their dot product is c_x b_x + c_y b_y = 0.

So from 3 and 4: Both DA and DB are perpendicular to DC. Hence, DA and DB are parallel vectors. So DA = λ DB for some scalar λ. So (a_x, a_y) = λ (b_x, b_y). 

Let me denote this as a_x = λ b_x, a_y = λ b_y.

Now, substitute this into the other equations. 

From condition 1: CD · AB = 0 → c_x(b_x - a_x) + c_y(b_y - a_y) = 0. Substituting a_x and a_y:

c_x(b_x - λ b_x) + c_y(b_y - λ b_y) = 0 → c_x b_x (1 - λ) + c_y b_y (1 - λ) = 0 → (1 - λ)(c_x b_x + c_y b_y) = 0.

But from condition 4, c_x b_x + c_y b_y = 0 (since DC · DB = 0). Hence, the entire expression becomes (1 - λ)*0 = 0, which holds true regardless of λ. So condition 1 is satisfied automatically. 

Condition 2: BD · AC = 0 → b_x(c_x - a_x) + b_y(c_y - a_y) = 0. Substitute a_x = λ b_x, a_y = λ b_y:

b_x(c_x - λ b_x) + b_y(c_y - λ b_y) = 0 → b_x c_x - λ b_x^2 + b_y c_y - λ b_y^2 = 0 → b_x c_x + b_y c_y - λ (b_x^2 + b_y^2) = 0.

But from condition 4, b_x c_x + b_y c_y = 0 (since DC · DB = 0). Hence, this reduces to:

0 - λ (b_x^2 + b_y^2) = 0 → λ (b_x^2 + b_y^2) = 0.

Assuming b_x^2 + b_y^2 ≠ 0 (since B is not at D), then λ = 0. 

If λ = 0, then a_x = 0, a_y = 0. So point A is at (0,0), which is D. But this would make DA a zero-length vector, which is not valid. Hence, contradiction. 

Wait, this suggests that the only solution is λ = 0, which places A at D, which is invalid. Hence, there's a contradiction. What does this mean? It suggests that under the given conditions, there's no valid configuration unless A is at D, which is impossible. But the problem states that such a configuration exists, so I must have made a mistake in my reasoning. 

Let me revisit the conditions. The problem gives that there are two right angles at D: angle CDA and angle BDC. Also, the perpendicularities of CD ⊥ AB and BD ⊥ AC. But according to the derivation, this leads to a contradiction unless A is at D. This suggests that there's an error in my understanding of the problem. 

Wait, maybe the lines are not AB and CD being perpendicular, but rather line CD is perpendicular to line AB. Similarly for BD and AC. But in the earlier derivation, this led to contradictions. Maybe the issue is that the lines are not intersecting at D? Wait, but the angles are at D, so lines CD and DA meet at D, and lines BD and DC meet at D. So all lines pass through D. 

Wait, let me check the original predicates again:

Perpendicular(Line(C,D), Line(A,B)): Line CD is perpendicular to Line AB.

Perpendicular(Line(B,D), Line(A,C)): Line BD is perpendicular to Line AC.

RightAngle(Angle(C,D,A)): At D, between C, D, A.

RightAngle(Angle(B,D,C)): At D, between B, D, C.

So, Line CD is one of the lines involved in the perpendicularity. Line AB is another. So line CD is perpendicular to line AB. Line BD is perpendicular to line AC.

But if line CD is perpendicular to AB, and line BD is perpendicular to AC, and both CD and BD pass through D, then AB and AC are related through these perpendiculars. 

Maybe I should consider that AB and AC are not in the same plane? No, the problem is purely geometric, so it's planar.

Another idea: Perhaps AB and AC are not in the same plane, but that doesn't make sense for a planar geometry problem. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the perpendicularity conditions. Let me double-check:

Perpendicular(Line(C,D), Line(A,B)): Line CD is perpendicular to Line AB. So line CD and line AB intersect at some point, and form a right angle. But in our case, since angle CDA is a right angle, which involves line CD and DA. So line CD intersects line DA at D, forming a right angle. But line AB is another line. How is line CD related to line AB? They must intersect at some point, but not necessarily at D. Wait, but the problem states that Line CD is perpendicular to Line AB. So the lines CD and AB are perpendicular, but not necessarily intersecting at D. 

Wait, this changes everything! Earlier, I assumed that line CD and line AB intersect at D, but actually, they might intersect elsewhere. Similarly, line BD and line AC might intersect elsewhere. 

Oh! This was the critical mistake. I incorrectly assumed that line CD and AB intersect at D, but actually, the lines CD and AB are just two lines that are perpendicular, but not necessarily intersecting at D. Similarly for BD and AC. 

That explains why earlier derivations led to contradictions. Let me start over with this corrected understanding. 

Let me redefine the scenario. We have four points: A, B, C, D. Lines CD and AB are perpendicular. Lines BD and AC are perpendicular. There are right angles at D: angle CDA and angle BDC. 

Let me focus on the right angles. Angle CDA is a right angle, so at point D, the lines DC and DA form a right angle. Similarly, angle BDC is a right angle, so at point D, lines DB and DC form a right angle. Hence, at point D, three lines: DC, DA, DB, with DC perpendicular to both DA and DB. Hence, DA and DB are both perpendicular to DC, so DA is parallel to DB. Hence, DA and DB are parallel. 

So DA || DB, and both are perpendicular to DC. So, DA and DB are parallel lines, both perpendicular to DC. This implies that DA and DB are in the same direction, or opposite directions. 

Let me try to model this with coordinates again. Let me place point D at (0,0). Let me take DC as a vertical line. So point C is (0, c). Since DA and DB are both perpendicular to DC (which is vertical), they must be horizontal. So DA is horizontal, so point A is (a, 0). DB is horizontal, so point B is (b, 0). 

Now, line AB connects A(a, 0) to B(b, 0), which is horizontal. Line CD is vertical, from D(0,0) to C(0, c). These lines are perpendicular, as required. 

Now, line AC connects A(a,0) to C(0,c). Line BD connects B(b,0) to D(0,0). For BD to be perpendicular to AC, their slopes must satisfy the condition. 

Slope of AC: (c - 0)/(0 - a) = -c/a.

Slope of BD: (0 - 0)/(0 - b) = 0. So BD is horizontal. For BD to be perpendicular to AC, the slope of AC must be undefined (vertical), but it's -c/a. This only happens if a = 0, which would put A at D(0,0), making DA zero length, which is invalid. 

Contradiction again. What's the issue? Ah, because in this setup, line BD is horizontal (same as DA), and line AC has slope -c/a. For BD to be perpendicular to AC, the product of their slopes must be -1. But BD has slope 0, so it's impossible. 

Wait, but the condition is that Line BD is perpendicular to Line AC. So, if Line AC is not horizontal, but Line BD is horizontal, then their slopes must multiply to -1. But BD has slope 0, so this is impossible. Hence, contradiction. 

This suggests that there's a fundamental inconsistency unless AC is vertical. But AC is from A(a,0) to C(0,c). To make AC vertical, a must be 0, which again puts A at D. 

This seems to indicate that the only way for BD to be perpendicular to AC is if AC is vertical, which requires A to coincide with D. But this is not allowed. 

What am I missing here? Let me revisit the problem statement. It says "Perpendicular(Line(B,D), Line(A,C))". So Line BD is perpendicular to Line AC. In my setup, Line BD is from B to D, and Line AC is from A to C. So these lines might intersect at some point other than D. 

Wait, in my current setup, Line AC is from A(a,0) to C(0,c). Line BD is from B(b,0) to D(0,0). These lines might intersect at some point. Let me calculate their intersection. 

Equation of Line AC: passes through (a,0) and (0,c). Its equation is x/a + y/c = 1.

Equation of Line BD: passes through (b,0) and (0,0). It's the x-axis from (0,0) to (b,0). 

Intersection point: Solve x/a + y/c = 1 and y = 0. Substituting y=0, x/a = 1 → x = a. So intersection at (a, 0), which is point A. So Line BD and Line AC intersect at A. 

For these lines to be perpendicular, the product of their slopes must be -1. Line AC has slope -c/a. Line BD is horizontal (slope 0). As before, this is impossible. 

This suggests that the only way for Line BD and Line AC to be perpendicular is if Line AC is vertical, but that requires a = 0. 

This is very confusing. Maybe the problem is not in the plane? Or perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the predicates. 

Wait, let me read the predicates again:

- Perpendicular(Line(C,D), Line(A,B)): Line CD is perpendicular to Line AB.
- Perpendicular(Line(B,D), Line(A,C)): Line BD is perpendicular to Line AC.
- RightAngle(Angle(C,D,A)): At D, angle between C-D-A is right.
- Right(RightAngle(Angle(B,D,C)): At D, angle between B-D-C is right.

So, the right angles are at D, involving DC with DA and DC with DB. Hence, DA and DB are both perpendicular to DC, so DA || DB. 

But Line CD is perpendicular to Line AB, and Line BD is perpendicular to Line AC. 

Maybe I need to consider that Line AB is not passing through D, but is simply another line that is perpendicular to Line CD. Similarly for Line AC and Line BD. 

Let me try to draw this. Let me imagine Line CD is vertical. Line AB is horizontal, perpendicular to CD. So Line AB is horizontal, Line CD is vertical. They intersect at some point, say E. Line BD is perpendicular to Line AC. 

But where is point D? It is part of both Line CD and the right angles at D. 

Let me try to assign coordinates again, this time not assuming D is at origin. Let me set Line CD as vertical, and Line AB as horizontal, intersecting at some point E. Let me choose coordinates such that E is at (0,0). Let me define:

- Line CD is vertical: let's say it passes through E(0,0), and extends upwards. So point D is on this line, say D(0, d). Point C is another point on this line, say C(0, c), where c > d or c < d.

- Line AB is horizontal, passing through E(0,0). Let me say A is (-a, 0), B is (b, 0), where a, b > 0.

Now, the right angles at D: Angle CDA and Angle BDC. 

At point D(0,d), angle CDA is formed by lines DC and DA. Line DC is from D(0,d) to C(0,c), which is vertical downward if c < d. Line DA is from D(0,d) to A(-a,0). This line DA has slope (0 - d)/(-a - 0) = d/a. For angle CDA to be right, DC and DA must be perpendicular. DC is vertical, so DA must be horizontal. But DA has slope d/a, which is not horizontal unless a approaches infinity. Not possible. 

Again, contradiction. 

I'm clearly missing something here. Let me try to use the given lengths. We know the length of CB is 8.5, length of AC is 8.8, and need to find length of DB (y). Maybe I can use Pythagoras with the given lengths. 

Let me think: If I can find a right triangle where these lengths are sides or hypotenuses. 

Given that there are right angles at D, maybe triangles CDA and BDC are right triangles. 

In triangle CDA, right-angled at D: CD and DA are legs, CA is hypotenuse. Given CA = 8.8, and CD is x, DA is some length. So x² + DA² = 8.8².

In triangle BDC, right-angled at D: BD and DC are legs, BC is hypotenuse. Given BC = 8.5, so BD² + DC² = 8.5². Here, BD is y, DC is x. So y² + x² = 8.5².

So if I can find another equation relating x and y, I can solve for y. 

But how? Let me look at the other perpendicularity conditions. 

Line CD is perpendicular to Line AB. Line BD is perpendicular to Line AC. 

Maybe these conditions allow us to relate DA and AB, or other lengths. 

Let me consider the coordinates again, but this time focusing on the right triangles. 

From triangle CDA: CD = x, DA = let's say m, then CA = 8.8 = √(x² + m²).

From triangle BDC: BD = y, DC = x, BC = 8.5 = √(y² + x²). So from this, we get x² + y² = 8.5² = 72.25. 

But we also have from triangle CDA: x² + m² = 8.8² = 77.44. 

So if I can find m in terms of other quantities, I can relate x and y. 

How? Let me think about the other conditions. 

Line CD is perpendicular to Line AB. Let me assume that Line AB is some line, and Line CD is perpendicular to it. 

Let me consider the coordinates of points. Let me assume that Line AB is horizontal, Line CD is vertical. Let me place point D at (0,0), Line CD is vertical, so C is (0, c). Line AB is horizontal, let's say it passes through some point. Let me say Line AB passes through point E, and is horizontal. 

But I need to relate this to the other conditions. 

Alternatively, since Line CD is perpendicular to Line AB, and Line BD is perpendicular to Line AC, maybe there's a relationship between the slopes of these lines. 

Let me denote:

Let me assume Line CD has slope m1, Line AB has slope m2, with m1 * m2 = -1 (since they're perpendicular). Similarly, Line BD has slope m3, Line AC has slope m4, with m3 * m4 = -1.

But without knowing the slopes, this might not help directly. 

But from the right triangles, we have x² + y² = 72.25 and x² + m² = 77.44. Subtracting gives m² - y² = 77.44 - 72.25 = 5.19. So m² = y² + 5.19. 

But what is m? m is the length of DA. Can I relate m to other quantities?

Yes! Because Line CD is perpendicular to Line AB. Let me consider the length of AB. If I can express AB in terms of m and other quantities, maybe. 

But I don't have direct info about AB. However, Line BD is perpendicular to Line AC. Let me think about this. 

Let me consider vectors. Vector AC is from A to C, and vector BD is from B to D. They are perpendicular. 

Let me denote:

Vector AC = C - A.

Vector BD = D - B.

Their dot product is zero: (C - A) · (D - B) = 0.

But without knowing coordinates of A, B, C, D, this is abstract. 

But maybe using the right triangles. Let me try to express vectors in terms of x, y, and m. 

From triangle CDA: DA = m, CD = x. So if I can express vector DA and vector CD, and relate to vector AC and vector BD.

Alternatively, let me think about the area or other relations. 

Wait, let me consider that Line CD is perpendicular to Line AB. Let me assume Line AB has length l. Then, since CD is perpendicular to AB, the area of parallelogram formed by AB and CD is |AB| * |CD|. But I don't know if that helps.

Alternatively, since Line CD is perpendicular to Line AB, and Line BD is perpendicular to Line AC, perhaps there is a relation between the lengths of these lines. 

But I'm stuck. Let me go back to the two equations I have:

1. x² + y² = 72.25 (from BC = 8.5)
2. x² + m² = 77.44 (from CA = 8.8)

Where m is DA. 

If I can find m in terms of y, then I can solve for y. 

How? Let me think about the other perpendicularity condition: Line CD ⊥ Line AB. 

Let me consider the slopes. Let me assume Line CD has slope s, so Line AB has slope -1/s. 

Let me also consider Line AC and Line BD being perpendicular. 

But without knowing the exact positions, it's difficult. 

Wait, let me consider that DA is m, and BD is y. From the right triangles, we have DA = m, and BD = y. Are there any relations between DA and BD? 

From the earlier analysis, DA and BD are both perpendicular to DC, so they are parallel. So DA || BD. Hence, the vectors DA and BD are parallel. So DA = k * BD for some scalar k. 

So, the length of DA is |k| * length of BD. So m = |k| * y. 

But what is k? It depends on the position of A and B relative to D. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging. However, if I can relate m and y through the other conditions. 

Let me think about the length of AB. Since Line CD is perpendicular to Line AB, and Line CD has length x (from D to C), and Line AB has some length. But I don't know AB's length. 

Alternatively, let me consider the triangle formed by A, B, and C. But I don't have enough info. 

Wait, but from the two equations:

From equation 1: x² = 72.25 - y²

From equation 2: x² = 77.44 - m²

Setting them equal: 72.25 - y² = 77.44 - m² → m² - y² = 5
