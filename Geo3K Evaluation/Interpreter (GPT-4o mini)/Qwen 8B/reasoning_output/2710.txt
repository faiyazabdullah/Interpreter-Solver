MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, we have a rectangle WXYZ, and we're told that the measure of angle 1 is 30 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle 5. Hmm, first, I should recall some properties of rectangles. 

Wait, rectangles have four right angles, right? Each angle in a rectangle is 90 degrees. But angle 1 is given as 30 degrees. That seems conflicting because in a rectangle, all angles are 90°. Maybe angle 1 isn't one of the internal angles of the rectangle? Or perhaps there are other lines or diagonals involved?

Oh, maybe angle 1 and angle 5 are formed by the diagonals intersecting? In a rectangle, the diagonals bisect each other and are equal in length. When they intersect, they form vertical angles. Also, the diagonals split the rectangle into two congruent triangles. Wait, but if the diagonals intersect, they might create some triangles where angles could be found.

Let me visualize this. Suppose the rectangle has vertices W, X, Y, Z. Let's say the diagonals are WY and XZ. They intersect at point O. Then, the diagonals divide each other into two equal parts. Now, if angle 1 is one of the angles formed at the intersection of the diagonals, then maybe angle 1 is part of a triangle created by the diagonal.

But wait, in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other, so the triangles formed are congruent. However, since the sides of the rectangle aren't necessarily equal unless it's a square. Since it's just a rectangle, adjacent sides can be different lengths. 

So, if we consider triangle WXO, where O is the intersection of the diagonals. The diagonals split each other into halves. Let's think about the angles here. If angle 1 is 30°, maybe it's one of the angles in that triangle. For example, if angle 1 is at vertex O, then maybe it's an acute angle formed by the diagonals. 

In a rectangle, the diagonals create two pairs of congruent angles. If one angle is 30°, then its vertical opposite angle would also be 30°, and the adjacent angles would be supplementary. Wait, because the sum of angles around a point is 360°, so if two angles are 30°, then the other two angles would be (360 - 2*30)/2 = 150° each. 

But how does this relate to angle 5? The problem mentions angle 5. Without seeing the diagram, I'm assuming that angle 5 refers to another angle formed by the intersection of diagonals or something else. Alternatively, maybe angle 1 and angle 5 are corresponding angles or alternate interior angles due to some transversal?

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is an angle inside the rectangle, not formed by the diagonals. Wait, but all internal angles of the rectangle are 90°, so angle 1 being 30° doesn't fit. Therefore, angle 1 must be formed by some other lines, like diagonals or maybe a triangle within the rectangle.

Another thought: sometimes problems involve drawing a diagonal and creating triangles, and then considering angles within those triangles. For instance, if angle 1 is part of a triangle where we can use trigonometry. Suppose angle 1 is at the base of a right triangle formed by the diagonal. For example, if we draw diagonal WY, splitting the rectangle into two right triangles. Then, angle 1 could be one of the angles in that triangle.

In a right triangle, the angles are 90°, and the other two angles add up to 90°. If angle 1 is one of those non-right angles, then maybe angle 1 is half of some relationship. Wait, but if the rectangle's sides are of different lengths, the angles in the triangle would depend on the ratio of the sides. For example, suppose the rectangle has length l and width w. Then, tan(angle) = opposite/adjacent = w/l. If angle 1 is 30°, then tan(30°) = w/l, implying that w/l = 1/√3, so the sides are in a 1:√3 ratio. 

Now, angle 5 might refer to another angle in the same triangle or another triangle. If angle 5 is the other acute angle in that triangle, then it would be 90° - 30° = 60°, since the angles in a triangle add up to 180°. So if angle 1 is 30°, angle 5 could be 60°. 

But why would angle 5 be 60°? Let me check again. If angle 1 is part of a right triangle formed by the diagonal, then yes, the other angle would be 60°, making angle 5 possibly that. However, without knowing exactly where angle 5 is located, it's tricky. But given the answer choices, 60° is option D. 

Alternatively, if angle 1 and angle 5 are vertical angles or something else. Wait, if the diagonals intersect, forming vertical angles. Suppose angle 1 is 30°, then its vertical angle would also be 30°, and the adjacent angles would be 150°, as earlier. If angle 5 is one of those adjacent angles, then it would be 150°, which isn't among the options. So that's not matching. 

Therefore, going back, maybe angle 1 is an angle in the triangle formed by the diagonal. Then angle 5 could be the complementary angle, leading to 60°, which is option D. 

Alternatively, if angle 1 is an angle outside the rectangle, but that seems unlikely. Given that the answer options don't have 150°, and 60° is present, I think the correct answer is D.
