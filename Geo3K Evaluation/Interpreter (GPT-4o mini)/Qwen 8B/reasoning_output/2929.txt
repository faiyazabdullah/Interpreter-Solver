<think>
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the points and lines mentioned.

Points: D, C, W, X, Y, Z, G, H, I, J. Lines: W-D, W-Z, Z-C, G-J, G-X, G-H, H-Y, H-I, Y-Z, Y-I, J-X. Triangles: WXY, GHI, GXJ. Also, there are some angle measures given: measure of angle at W,X,G is 130 degrees, and measure of angle at Y,Z,C is 20 degrees. Additionally, point W lies on line D-X, and point Z lies on line Y-C. 

The question asks for the measure of angle J, given that the ratio IJ/XJ equals HJ/YJ, and also that angle WXJ is 130 degrees and angle WZG is 20 degrees. Wait, but the original problem mentions m∠WXJ=130 and m∠WZG=20? Or maybe it's m∠WXJ=130 and m∠YZC=20? Let me check again. The user wrote: "m ∠ W X J = 130 and m ∠ W Z G = 20". So those two angles are given.

So first, I need to visualize or sketch the diagram based on these points and lines. Let me try to map out the structure.

Starting with the triangles: Triangle WXY and Triangle GHI. Also, Triangle GXJ. Points involved in these triangles. Let me note down the lines:

For Triangle WXY: points W, X, Y connected. The line W-D is present, so point D is somewhere on line WX? Because PointLiesOnLine(W, Line(D,X)) means that W is on line DX. Wait, the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(W, Line(D,X))? Wait, the original says: PointLiesOnLine(W,Line(D,X)). Wait, no: the actual predicate was "PointLiesOnLine(W,Line(D,X))" — wait, no, looking back: "PointLiesOnLine(W,Line(D,X))" — meaning that point W lies on line D-X? Wait, the original says:

"PointLiesOnLine(W,Line(D,X))" — so point W is on line DX. Similarly, "PointLiesOnLine(Z,Line(Y,C))" — point Z is on line YC.

Let me try to reconstruct the figure.

First, consider line W-D and W-Z. Since W is connected to D and Z, forming lines WD and WZ. Then Z is connected to C via line ZC. Also, Z lies on line YC, meaning that line YC passes through Z. So line YC has points Y, Z, C in order?

Also, there's line YZ and YI. So Y is connected to Z and to I. And line HI connects H to I. Also, line H-Y connects H to Y. So point H is connected to Y and to I. Also, line G-J, G-X, G-H. So point G is connected to J, X, and H. Triangle GHI implies that G, H, I form a triangle. Also, triangle GXJ, so points G, X, J form a triangle.

Additionally, there's line JX connecting J and X, and line JG connecting J to G.

Now, angles given: measure of angle at W,X,G is 130 degrees. That would be angle WXG? Wait, the angle measure is MeasureOf(Angle(W,X,G)), which is angle at X between W and G. So angle WXG is 130 degrees. Also, measure of angle Y,Z,C is 20 degrees, which is angle YZC, i.e., angle at Z between Y and C, which is 20 degrees.

Given that ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. So that suggests that triangles may be similar or something involving proportionality.

We need to find m∠J, which is likely referring to angle at point J, perhaps angle IJG or another angle depending on the configuration.

But first, let me think about the given ratios: IJ / XJ = HJ / YJ. This looks like a proportion that could suggest similar triangles or perhaps the Angle Bisector Theorem, since the ratio of sides around an angle being equal implies that a line divides the opposite side proportionally.

Alternatively, if we have a triangle where a line splits the opposite side in the same ratio as two sides, then maybe we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem here. But I need to see which triangle this applies to.

Looking at the points involved in the ratio: IJ and XJ are segments connected to J, and HJ and YJ are segments connected to J. Wait, HJ is part of triangle GHI? Maybe. Let me try to find which triangle or configuration this ratio belongs to.

Alternatively, considering points I, J, X, H, Y. Since there's a line YI, and H is connected to Y and I. Also, point J is connected to G and X. Hmm.

Wait, the ratio is IJ / XJ = HJ / YJ. Let me rearrange this as IJ / HJ = XJ / YJ. Which resembles the condition for similar triangles or perhaps the Law of Sines or Cosines.

Alternatively, if we consider triangle JH... something. Alternatively, maybe triangle JHX and JY... ?

Alternatively, since there are several lines connected to J, such as GJ, JX, and possibly others. Let me think about the triangles that involve J. There's triangle GXJ (given), so points G, X, J. Also, line JX exists. Also, line GJ exists.

Moreover, there's triangle GHI, which includes point H connected to G, H, I. Also, H is connected to Y and I (lines HY and HI). Also, point Y is connected to Z and I (line YI).

This seems quite interconnected. Maybe we need to look for cyclic quadrilaterals, similar triangles, or use the given angles.

Given the angles: angle WXG is 130°, and angle YZC is 20°. These angles might be related to other parts of the diagram.

Let me try to focus on the triangles where these angles are located.

First, angle WXG is part of triangle WXG. But point G is connected to X and H, and J. Also, line GJ and GX are given. So triangle GXJ includes points G, X, J. In that triangle, angle at X is angle GXJ, which is given as 130°, since m∠WXJ is 130°. Wait, the angle WXJ would be at point X between W and J. Wait, but earlier, the given angle was MeasureOf(Angle(W,X,G)) which is angle at X between W and G. Now, the question mentions angle WXJ, which is angle at X between W and J. So that's different. Therefore, angle WXJ is at point X between W and J, which is part of triangle WXJ. Given that angle WXJ is 130°, same as angle WXG? Wait, unless J is aligned with G somehow? Not sure yet.

Similarly, angle WZG is given as 20°, which is angle at Z between W and G. So point Z is connected to W and G? Wait, line WZ exists, and line ZC. Also, point Z lies on line YC. So line YC passes through Z. Therefore, line YC contains points Y, Z, C.

Now, trying to connect these elements.

Let me attempt to draw the diagram mentally.

Start with point W connected to D and Z. Point Z is connected to C and lies on line YC. So line YC goes through Z. Also, line YZ is present, so Y is connected to Z. Also, line YI connects Y to I. Point I is connected to H (line HI) and to Y (line YI). Also, line H is connected to Y and to G (line HY and HG). Point G is connected to H, X, and J. Line GJ and GX exist, so G is connected to J and X. Line JX connects J to X. Also, line JG connects J to G.

So, considering triangle GXJ: points G, X, J. We know angle at X is 130°, as per m∠WXJ = 130°. Also, angle WZG is 20°, which is angle at Z between W and G. So point Z is connected to W and G? Wait, line WZ connects W to Z, and line ZG? Is there a line ZG? Wait, the given lines are W-D, W-Z, Z-C, G-J, G-X, G-H, H-Y, H-I, Y-Z, Y-I, J-X. So line ZG isn't explicitly mentioned. However, angle WZG involves points W, Z, G. So that would require that G is connected to Z? But according to the given lines, G is connected to J, X, H. Unless there's an implicit connection? Wait, maybe there's a line connecting Z to G? Not directly stated, but perhaps through other connections.

Wait, angle WZG is formed by points W, Z, G. So lines WZ and ZG. Since WZ is a given line (from W to Z), and ZG would be another line. But ZG isn't listed among the given lines. So maybe ZG is a segment that is part of another line? For example, if there's a line from Z to G passing through some other points. But without explicit lines, it's hard to say. However, the angle WZG is given as 20°, so we can assume that such an angle exists even if the line ZG isn't explicitly named. So we can take that as given.

Now, moving to the main question: find m∠J, which probably refers to angle at point J. Let me think about which angle that could be. It could be angle IJG, angle IJX, or another angle involving J. But given the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ, perhaps we need to consider triangles involving J and the given ratio.

Since the ratio is IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ, this suggests that triangles might be similar. For instance, if we consider triangles that have sides proportional in this ratio.

Alternatively, using the converse of the Angle Bisector Theorem: if a line divides the opposite side in the ratio of the adjacent sides, then it's an angle bisector. But here, the ratio is IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. Wait, but the points involved are I, J, X, H, Y. Maybe there's a triangle where this ratio applies. For example, if we consider triangle JHY and some other triangle, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe triangle JXY and triangle JHY? Let me think.

Wait, let's suppose that in triangle JXY, the line JH divides XY in the ratio IJ/HJ = XJ/YJ? No, not sure. Alternatively, maybe triangle JIH and JXY? Not sure.

Alternatively, considering the given ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ, cross-multiplying gives IJ*YJ = HJ*XJ. Which suggests that the product of IJ and YJ equals product of HJ and XJ. Which is reminiscent of the Power of a Point theorem, but that usually relates to secants or tangents. Alternatively, it might indicate similar triangles if certain angles are equal.

Alternatively, if there's a triangle where IJ corresponds to HJ and XJ corresponds to YJ, then similarity could be inferred. Suppose triangles IJY ~ HJX? If that were true, then corresponding angles would be equal. But I need to verify if that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe triangle JIH ~ triangle JXY? Not sure.

Alternatively, since there are lines connecting H to Y and I, and Y to I, and J to X, maybe there's a parallelogram or something.

Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines in some triangles. Let me consider triangle JXG and triangle JYG, but I don't know enough about the angles.

Wait, let's recall that angle WXJ is 130°, which is part of triangle WXJ. Also, angle WZG is 20°, which is part of triangle WZG. Perhaps these angles are related to other angles in the diagram.

Another thought: since angle WXJ is 130°, and angle WZG is 20°, maybe there's a way to relate these angles through some transversal or intersecting lines.

Alternatively, since we have triangles GXJ and WZG with given angles, maybe there's a relationship between them.

But I need to find angle at J. Let's think about which angle that is. If J is part of triangle GXJ, then angle at J would be angle GJX or angle JGX. But the question says "m∠J", so it's ambiguous unless specified. However, given the options, it's more likely referring to angle at J in a specific triangle, perhaps angle IJG or angle IJX or something similar.

Wait, but the given ratio involves points I, J, X, H, Y. So maybe angle at J is part of triangle IJH or something else.

Alternatively, since there's a triangle GHI and line HI, and line HY, and point J connected to G and X. Maybe there's a way to link these.

Let me try to think about the given ratio again: IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. Let me write this as IJ / HJ = XJ / YJ. This suggests that the ratio of IJ to HJ is equal to the ratio of XJ to YJ. So, if we imagine a triangle where these sides correspond, perhaps triangle JHI and JXY? If that's the case, then maybe they are similar, leading to corresponding angles being equal.

Assuming triangles JHI and JXY are similar, then angle at J would be common, and other angles would be equal. However, without knowing the correspondence of sides, it's hard to say. Let me try to define the similarity.

Suppose triangle JHI ~ triangle JXY. Then:

IJ / JH = JX / JY, but that doesn't align with our ratio. Our ratio is IJ / XJ = HJ / YJ → IJ / HJ = XJ / YJ. So if we have triangle JXI ~ triangle JHY, then sides XI/JY = IX/JH, but not sure.

Alternatively, if we consider triangle JXH and triangle JYI. Wait, the ratio is IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ → IJ/HJ = XJ/YJ. So if triangle JXH ~ triangle JYI, then the ratio of sides would be:

JX / JY = XH / YI = JH / JI. But not sure.

Alternatively, if we consider triangle JIX and triangle JHY, then the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ would imply that these triangles are similar, assuming the included angles are equal. But I need to confirm if the angles are equal.

Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines in triangles involving J. For example, in triangle JXG and triangle JYG.

But I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently.

Given that angle WXJ is 130°, which is part of triangle WXJ. Also, angle WZG is 20°, which is part of triangle WZG. Maybe these angles are supplementary or complementary to other angles.

Let me consider triangle WXJ. In this triangle, angle at X is 130°, and we might need to find other angles. But without more info on sides or other angles, it's tricky.

Alternatively, since point W lies on line DX, and line DX is connected to D and X. Also, point Z lies on line YC. Maybe there's a way to use vertical angles or other angle relationships.

Wait, angle WZG is 20°, which is at point Z between W and G. So lines WZ and ZG meet at Z with angle 20°. If I can relate this angle to other parts of the diagram.

Also, angle YZC is 20°, which is at point Z between Y and C. Since point Z lies on line YC, that angle is part of triangle YZC. So angle at Z is 20°, making that triangle possibly having some relation to the other 20° angle at Z.

Wait, angle WZG is at Z between W and G, while angle YZC is at Z between Y and C. Are these angles related? If line WG intersects line YC at Z, then maybe there's a linear pair or something. But without knowing the exact position of G relative to Z, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, since angle WZG is 20°, and angle YZC is 20°, maybe there's a way to show that lines WG and YC are parallel or something, creating alternate interior angles. But that requires more information.

Alternatively, focusing back on the given ratio: IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. Let me denote this as:

IJ / XJ = HJ / YJ → IJ / HJ = XJ / YJ.

This suggests that the ratio of distances from J to I and J to H is the same as the ratio of distances from J to X and J to Y. This is reminiscent of the Angle Bisector Theorem, where if a line bisects an angle, then it divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. But here, the ratio is between IJ and HJ versus XJ and YJ. So if there's a line from J that creates this proportion, it might be an angle bisector.

But where is this line? If there's a line from J that creates this proportion, it might be relating to triangle JXY or JHY.

Alternatively, since H is connected to Y and I, and I is connected to Y, maybe there's a triangle involving J, H, Y, and another point.

Alternatively, considering triangle JHY and triangle JXY, if the ratio holds, then maybe they are similar. Let me explore this.

In triangle JHY and triangle JXY:

If IJ / XJ = HJ / YJ, then if these triangles are similar, the sides would be proportional. But for similarity, we need corresponding angles to be equal. Suppose angle at J is common, and if another angle is equal, then similarity follows.

But I don't know the angles. However, if angle J is common, and if another pair of angles is equal, then triangles would be similar. But I need to check if that's the case.

Alternatively, if the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ and angle at J is common, then by SAS similarity, the triangles would be similar. Wait, but SAS requires that the included angle is equal. Here, the sides around angle J would be IJ and HJ for one triangle, and XJ and YJ for the other. But unless the angle between IJ and HJ is equal to the angle between XJ and YJ, which we don't know.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express the angles in terms of other known angles.

Let me think about the given angles again. Angle WXJ is 130°, which is at X. Angle WZG is 20°, at Z. Maybe these angles are related to other angles in the diagram through triangle properties.

Alternatively, since there are triangles GXJ and WZG with known angles, maybe there's a way to find other angles in those triangles.

In triangle GXJ, we know angle at X is 130°, and if we can find other angles, maybe we can relate them to other parts. But without more information about sides or other angles, it's difficult.

Wait, but maybe triangle GXJ and triangle WZG are similar or congruent? Let's see: angle at X is 130°, angle at Z is 20°. If there's a relationship between these triangles, like a shared side or something.

Alternatively, considering that angle at Z is 20°, and angle at X is 130°, which adds up to 150°, which might be related to other angles in the diagram.

Alternatively, since angle WXJ is 130°, which is part of triangle WXJ, and angle WZG is 20°, which is part of triangle WZG, perhaps these angles are related through some transversal or intersection.

At this point, I'm struggling to see the direct connection, so maybe I should try to assign variables to unknown angles and set up equations.

Let me denote some variables. Let’s assume that angle at J is θ, which we need to find.

Looking at triangle GXJ: we know angle at X is 130°, and we might find other angles. Let's call angle at G as α and angle at J as β. So α + β + 130° = 180°, so α + β = 50°. But without more info, can't proceed.

Similarly, in triangle WZG, angle at Z is 20°, and if we can find other angles, but again missing info.

However, the given ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ suggests that there's a proportion that might lead us to use the Law of Sines in some triangles.

For example, in triangle JXI and triangle JHY, applying the Law of Sines:

In triangle JXI: sin(angle at J)/XI = sin(angle at I)/XJ

In triangle JHY: sin(angle at J)/HY = sin(angle at H)/YJ

But unless we can relate these, it's not helpful.

Alternatively, since IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ, then IJ/HJ = XJ/YJ. If we consider triangles that share angle J, and have sides in this ratio, maybe they are similar.

Let me consider triangles JIH and JXY. If IJ/HJ = XJ/YJ, and if angle at J is common, then by SAS similarity, triangles JIH and JXY would be similar. Wait, but for SAS similarity, the included angles must be equal. If angle at J is common, and the ratio of sides around it is equal, then yes. So if angle IJH is equal to angle XJY, then triangles JIH and JXY would be similar.

Assuming that, then corresponding angles would be equal. For instance, angle at I in triangle JIH would be equal to angle at X in triangle JXY. But I don't know if that's the case.

Alternatively, if angle at J is common, and the sides around it are in proportion, then the triangles are similar by SAS. So if IJ/HJ = XJ/YJ and angle at J is common, then triangle JIH ~ triangle JXY.

If that's true, then corresponding angles are equal. So angle at I in triangle JIH equals angle at X in triangle JXY. Let's denote angle at I as γ and angle at X as δ. So γ = δ.

But angle at X in triangle JXY is part of the given angle WXJ = 130°. Wait, angle at X in triangle JXY is angle JXY, which is part of angle WXJ. If angle JXY is part of angle WXJ, which is 130°, then maybe angle JXY is a portion of that.

Alternatively, if angle JXY is equal to angle IJH, which is another angle in the diagram. But without knowing more about the diagram, it's challenging.

But if triangle JIH ~ triangle JXY, then angle at I (in JIH) equals angle at X (in JXY). Let's assume that. Then, if I can relate these angles to known ones.

But I'm still missing concrete relations. Let me try to think of another approach.

Since the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ, which is equivalent to IJ * YJ = XJ * HJ. This is the condition for the existence of a harmonic division or for a particular type of concurrency, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, this could mean that point J lies on the circumcircle of some triangle, but I need more info.

Alternatively, using mass point geometry, but I'm not familiar enough with that.

Alternatively, since there are multiple triangles and lines, maybe using coordinates. Assign coordinates to the points and compute the angles. But that might be time-consuming, but feasible.

Let me attempt coordinate geometry. Let's choose coordinates for simplicity.

Let me place point Z at the origin (0,0) to simplify calculations. Since point Z lies on line YC, and angle YZC is 20°, which is at Z between Y and C. Let's assume line YC is along the x-axis for simplicity. So let me set:

- Point Z at (0,0).
- Line YC is the x-axis, so Y is at (-a, 0) and C is at (b, 0) for some positive a and b. Since angle YZC is 20°, the line ZC makes a 20° angle with ZY. Wait, no: angle YZC is at Z between Y and C, so if Y is at (-a, 0), Z is at (0,0), and C is at (c, 0), then angle YZC would be zero because all points are colinear. Wait, that can't be. So my assumption is wrong.

Ah, right! Since angle YZC is 20°, points Y, Z, C cannot be colinear. Wait, but the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(Z, Line(Y,C)), meaning that point Z lies on line YC. So points Y, Z, C are colinear. But then angle YZC would be a straight angle (180°), contradicting the given measure of 20°. This suggests a contradiction, implying that my interpretation is incorrect.

Wait, this is a critical mistake. The predicate says "PointLiesOnLine(Z, Line(Y,C))" — meaning that point Z lies on line YC. So points Y, Z, C are colinear, with Z between Y and C. Thus, angle YZC would be a straight angle, which contradicts the given measure of 20°. This indicates that my understanding of the predicate is wrong.

Wait, no! Wait, angle YZC is the angle at Z between Y and C. If points Y, Z, C are colinear, then angle YZC would be 180°, not 20°. But the given measure is 20°, so this suggests that there's an error in my interpretation of the predicate.

Wait, let me recheck the original predicates:

"PointLiesOnLine(Z,Line(Y,C))" — this means that point Z is on line YC. So line YC contains point Z. So points Y, Z, C are colinear, with Z lying somewhere on line YC. So angle YZC is the angle at Z between Y and C, which would be a straight angle if Y, Z, C are colinear. But the given measure is 20°, which suggests that this is not the case. Hence, there must be a misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe the angle is not between Y and C, but between YZ and CZ? Wait, angle YZC is at Z, with segments ZY and ZC. If Z is on line YC, then ZY and ZC are collinear, making the angle 180°, which conflicts with the given 20°. This inconsistency suggests that my initial parsing of the predicate is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the predicate is misread. Let me check again:

Original predicates:

- PointLiesOnLine(W,Line(D,X)): Point W lies on line DX.

- PointLiesOnLine(Z,Line(Y,C)): Point Z lies on line YC.

Ah! Wait, the second predicate is PointLiesOnLine(Z, Line(Y,C)), meaning that point Z is on line YC. So line YC is defined by points Y and C, and point Z lies on this line. Hence, Y, Z, C are colinear with Z between Y and C. But then angle YZC is at Z, between Y and C, which would make it a straight angle, conflicting with the given measure of 20°. This suggests either a mistake in the problem setup, or my misinterpretation.

Wait, perhaps the angle is not between YZ and CZ, but between YZ and some other line? No, the angle is measured as MeasureOf(Angle(Y,Z,C)), which is standard notation for angle at Z between Y and C. So this suggests a contradiction, implying that there's a mistake in the problem or in my understanding.

Wait, maybe the line YC is not straight? No, lines are straight by definition. Or maybe there's a typo in the predicate? For example, perhaps it's supposed to be PointLiesOnLine(W, Line(Y,C))? Or another point?

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is not at Z, but at another point? No, the angle is MeasureOf(Angle(Y,Z,C)), which is at Z.

This contradiction suggests that there's an error in the problem statement, or perhaps I've misread the predicates. Let me double-check.

Original problem statement:

"...PointLiesOnLine(W,Line(D,X)) - PointLiesOnLine(Z,Line(Y,C))..."

And the given angle is MeasureOf(Angle(Y,Z,C)) = 20°.

This is a contradiction unless the points Y, Z, C are not colinear. But the predicate says Z lies on line YC, hence they are colinear. This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the line YC is not a straight line? No, lines are straight by definition. So this seems impossible. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the predicates.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the line YC is not the line containing Y and C, but rather some other construction? No, the predicate specifies Line(Y,C), which is the line through Y and C.

Unless there's another line involved. Wait, but the line YC is defined, and Z is on it. So the angle YZC is a straight angle, but the problem states it's 20°. This is a contradiction. How to resolve this?

Perhaps the angle is not between YZ and ZC, but between YZ and some other segment? Like YZ and ZG? Wait, no, the angle is specified as Y,Z,C, so it's between YZ and ZC.

This suggests that either the problem is ill-posed, or there's a misinterpretation. Let me re-examine the problem statement again.

Wait, perhaps the angle is at Z between Y and C, but Z is not on line YC? But the predicate says it is. This is very puzzling.

Wait, perhaps there's a misprint in the predicate. Maybe it should be PointLiesOnLine(Z, Line(Y,I)) instead of Line(Y,C)? Or another line? Without further information, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe the angle is not at Z, but at another point? Let me re-read the original problem statement.

The given angle is MeasureOf(Angle(Y,Z,C)) = 20°. So it's definitely at Z. This suggests that there's an inconsistency, but since it's a problem posed to solve, I must assume that my interpretation is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the line YC is not the line through Y and C, but another line? No, Line(Y,C) is the line connecting Y and C.

Wait, maybe the angle is not in Euclidean geometry? Unlikely, since it's a standard geometry problem.

Alternatively, maybe Z is not between Y and C, but extended beyond? For example, if line YC extends beyond C to Z, making Z outside the segment YC. In that case, angle YZC would be an external angle. Let me consider this scenario.

If Z is not between Y and C, but on the extension of line YC beyond C, then angle YZC would be the angle at Z between Y and C. In this case, if line YC is extended past C to Z, then angle YZC would be the angle between ZY and ZC, which would be a reflex angle if Z is on the extension. But typically, angles in geometry problems are considered as the smaller angle unless specified otherwise. So if Z is on the extension of YC beyond C, then angle YZC would be 180° minus the angle between YC and ZC, which might be 20°, but that would require that the angle between YC and ZC is 160°, which seems arbitrary.

Alternatively, if Z is on the extension of YC beyond Y, then angle YZC would be the angle between ZY and ZC, which would be a straight angle again.

Wait, this is perplexing. Perhaps the problem has a typo, and the intended angle is at Y or C? Or perhaps the angle is at Y between Z and C? Let me check.

If the angle is at Y, it would be MeasureOf(Angle(Y,Z,C)) = angle at Y between Z and C, which would make sense if Z is not on line YC. But the predicate says Z is on line YC, so that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the angle is at C, but that would be MeasureOf(Angle(C,Y,Z)), which is different.

At this point, I'm stuck due to this contradiction. Perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that despite the apparent contradiction, the angle YZC is indeed 20°, and there's a way for it to exist even with Z on line YC. How?

Wait, perhaps Z is not on the line YC, but on another line? No, the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(Z, Line(Y,C)), so Z is on line YC. This is very confusing.

Maybe the angle is not between YZ and ZC, but between YZ and another segment? Like YZ and ZG? But the angle is specified as Y,Z,C.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is between YZ and some other line, but the notation is ambiguous. For example, in some contexts, Angle(Y,Z,C) could be interpreted as the angle at Z between Y and C, but if Z is on line YC, this is a straight angle. Hence, the only way this makes sense is if there's an error in the problem statement. 

Given that this is a problem meant to be solved, I'll assume that there's a misinterpretation on my part. Let me try to reinterpret the predicate. Perhaps the predicate is PointLiesOnLine(Z, Line(Y,I)) instead of Line(Y,C)? Let me check the original list of predicates.

Original list of predicates:

- Line(W,D)

- Line(W,Z)

- Line(Z,C)

- Line(G,J)

- Line(G,X)

- Line(G,H)

- Line(H,Y)

- Line(H,I)

- Line(Y,Z)

- Line(Y,I)

- Line(J,X)

- Triangle(W,X,Y)

- Triangle(G,H,I)

- Triangle(G,J,X)

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(W,X,G)), 130)

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(Y,Z,C)), 20)

- PointLiesOnLine(W,Line(D,X))

- PointLiesOnLine(Z,Line(Y,C))

Ah! Wait, there is a line Y,Z (from the list: Line(Y,Z)). So line YZ exists. Also, line YC is mentioned in the predicate, but line YC is not explicitly defined as a separate entity, but it's implied by the predicate PointLiesOnLine(Z, Line(Y,C)). So, line YC is the line through Y and C. But since Z is on line YC, and line YZ is already present, this implies that line YC is the same as line YZ. Wait, but line YZ is from the predicate Line(Y,Z), so line YZ is the same as line YC? That would mean that C is on line YZ, and Z is on line YC (which is line YZ). So point C is on line YZ. Hence, points Y, Z, C are colinear, with Z between Y and C or extending beyond. This resolves the contradiction!

Wait, this makes sense. Line YZ is from the given Line(Y,Z), and the predicate PointLiesOnLine(Z, Line(Y,C)) means that point Z is on line YC. But line YC is the same as line YZ, since C is on line YZ. Therefore, line YC is line YZ, and Z is on line YZ. Hence, points Y, Z, C are colinear, with Z between Y and C or extended. This resolves the earlier contradiction. So angle YZC is at point Z between Y and C, which are points on line YZ. Hence, if Z is between Y and C, then angle YZC is a straight angle, but if Z is beyond C, then angle YZC would be the angle between ZY and ZC, which is supplementary to the angle between YZ and YC.

Wait, let me clarify. If line YC is the same as line YZ, then C is a point on line YZ. So, if Z is between Y and C, then angle YZC is a straight angle (180°). But the problem states it's 20°, so this implies that Z is not between Y and C, but rather, C is between Y and Z. Wait, no. Let me think carefully.

If line YC is the same as line YZ, and point Z is on line YC, then C is on line YZ. So, the line YZ extends through Z to C. So, if C is on line YZ, then depending on the position of C, Z could be between Y and C, or C could be between Y and Z.

If Z is between Y and C, then angle YZC is the angle at Z between Y and C, which would be a straight angle (180°). But the problem says it's 20°, so that's not possible. Hence, C must be on the other side of Z from Y. So, line YZ extends through Z to C, making C on the extension of YZ beyond Z. In this case, angle YZC is the angle at Z between Y and C, which would be a straight angle if C is on the line, but since C is on the line, it's still a straight angle. Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, if C is on line YZ, then angle YZC is the angle between YZ and CZ. Since C is on line YZ, CZ is the same line as YZ, so the angle between YZ and CZ is 180°, which again contradicts the given 20°.

This suggests that there's still an issue. But since the problem is solvable, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the line YC. Let me reconsider.

Perhaps the line YC is not the same as line YZ. Wait, the line YC is defined by points Y and C, while line YZ is defined by points Y and Z. These are two different lines unless Z and C are the same point, which they aren't. Hence, the predicate PointLiesOnLine(Z, Line(Y,C)) means that point Z is on line YC, which is a separate line from YZ. Hence, line YC is distinct from line YZ. Therefore, points Y, Z, C are not colinear, and Z is on line YC, which is a different line from YZ. This resolves the contradiction. 

Wait, but then line YZ is a separate line from line YC. So, line YZ connects Y and Z, and line YC connects Y and C, with Z on line YC. So, this means that line YC passes through Z, and line YZ is another line connecting Y and Z. Hence, points Y, Z, C are not colinear, and Z is on line YC. This makes sense. So, line YC is a line passing through Y and C, with Z on it, and line YZ is a separate line connecting Y and Z. This allows for angle YZC to exist as a non-straight angle.

Ah! This clears up the confusion. So, line YC is one line, and line YZ is another line, with Z on line YC. Hence, points Y, Z, C are on line YC, and line YZ is another line from Y to Z. This means that Z is on line YC, and there's also a line from Y to Z, which is line YZ. This makes sense now. So, angle YZC is at Z, between Y and C, and since Z is on line YC, this angle is formed by the lines ZY and ZC, which are parts of line YC. Wait, but if Z is on line YC, then ZY and ZC are collinear, making the angle 180°. This brings us back to the contradiction.

Wait, no! If Z is on line YC, then line YC is the same as line ZY and ZC. Wait, no. Line YC is the line through Y and C, and Z is a point on this line. So, line YC contains points Y, Z, C in some order. Hence, Z is between Y and C, or C is between Y and Z, or Y is between Z and C. In any case, the angle YZC would be a straight angle if Z is between Y and C, or it would be the angle between ZY and ZC, which are parts of the same line, hence 180°. But the problem states this angle is 20°, so this is impossible. 

This suggests that there's a fundamental flaw in the problem setup, but since it's a problem to solve, I must proceed under the assumption that there's a different interpretation. Perhaps the angle is not between YZ and ZC, but between YZ and some other segment?

Wait, maybe the angle is at Z between Y and some other point? For example, if the angle is between YZ and ZG, but the problem states it's Y,Z,C. 

At this point, I'm stuck. To move forward, I'll assume that despite the apparent contradiction, the angle YZC is 20°, and proceed with the rest of the problem, hoping that it resolves itself.

Let me focus on the given ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. Assuming this, and the given angles, I need to find m∠J.

Let me consider triangle GXJ where angle at X is 130°, and try to find other angles. Also, angle WZG is 20°, which might relate to other parts.

Since IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ, and assuming this leads to similar triangles, let's assume that triangles JIH and JXY are similar. If so, then angle at J is common, and the other angles are equal. Let's say angle at I in JIH is equal to angle at X in JXY. 

If angle at X in JXY is part of the given angle WXJ = 130°, then perhaps angle at X in JXY is 130°, and thus angle at I in JIH is also 130°. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, since angle WXJ is 130°, and if angle JXY is part of this angle, then maybe angle JXY is 130°, leading to some relation.

Alternatively, using the Law of Sines in triangle GXJ and triangle WZG.

In triangle GXJ, angle at X is 130°, let's call angle at G as α and at J as β, so α + β = 50°.

In triangle WZG, angle at Z is 20°, let's call angle at W as γ and at G as δ, so γ + δ = 160°.

But without more information, it's hard to connect these.

However, if there's a relationship between these triangles, such as similar triangles or some angle relations, it might help.

Assuming that angle at G in triangle GXJ is equal to angle at G in triangle WZG, but this is a stretch.

Alternatively, since angle WXJ is 130°, and angle WZG is 20°, these might add up to 150°, which could be related to other angles.

But I'm still stuck. Let me try to think about the answer choices: 40, 55, 60, 70. These are typical angles in geometric problems.

If the angle at J is 40°, 55°, etc., perhaps it's half of 80°, or related to the given angles.

Since the given angles are 130° and 20°, which sum to 150°, and if there's a triangle with these angles, the third angle would be 30°, but not sure.

Alternatively, using the fact that the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ, and applying the Law of Sines in triangles involving J.

In triangle JXG and triangle JYG, if we can relate the sides.

But without knowing the specific triangles, it's difficult.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll make an educated guess. Since the given angles are 130° and 20°, and the ratio suggests a proportion, the angle at J might be 50°, but that's not an option. Or 180° - 130° - 20° = 30°, but
