MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse the given predicates and figure out what's going on here. 

So, the problem says we have a right triangle ABC, with a right angle at point A. Wait, wait—the first predicate is RightAngle(Angle(B,A,C)). That means the angle at point A is a right angle because the angle is formed by points B, A, C. So vertex A is the right angle. Then there's another predicate saying Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,B)), 60). Let me make sure I interpret that correctly. The angle measure at point C? Wait, Angle(A,C,B) would be the angle at point C, with segments CA and CB. So angle at C is 60 degrees. Also, the triangle is a right triangle, so combining these two facts: right angle at A, angle at C is 60 degrees. Therefore, the remaining angle at B must be 30 degrees since the angles in a triangle add up to 180. Let me check: 90 + 60 + 30 = 180, yes that works. 

Now, the sides: LengthOf(Line(B,A)) is 14. So BA is 14 units long. The other sides are AC = x and BC = y, which we need to find y. Since it's a right triangle, maybe I can use trigonometry or the Pythagorean theorem. But since we know one angle (angle at C is 60°), perhaps using trigonometric ratios would be better. 

Let me visualize the triangle. Right-angled at A, so sides AB and AC are the legs, and BC is the hypotenuse. Wait, but angle at C is 60°, so maybe I should consider the sides relative to angle C. Let me think again. In triangle ABC, angle at A is 90°, angle at C is 60°, so angle at B is 30°. Now, side opposite angle A is BC (since angle A is the right angle), so BC is the hypotenuse. Side opposite angle B (which is 30°) is AC. And side opposite angle C (60°) is AB. Wait, AB is given as 14. Let me confirm:

In triangle ABC, with right angle at A:

- AB is adjacent to angle C (since angle C is at point C, connected to points B and A). Wait, maybe I should label the triangle properly. Let me sketch mentally:

Point A is the right angle. So sides AB and AC form the right angle. Point B is connected to A and C, and point C is connected to A and B. So the triangle has vertices A (right angle), B, and C. 

Angles: At A: 90°, at C: 60°, so angle at B is 30°. 

Therefore, in terms of sides:

- Opposite angle A (90°): BC (hypotenuse)
- Opposite angle B (30°): AC
- Opposite angle C (60°): AB

Wait, AB is opposite angle C. Because angle C is at point C, so the side opposite is AB. So if angle C is 60°, then AB is opposite to it. Given that AB is length 14, so AB = 14. 

Since angle C is 60°, and angle B is 30°, then in a right-angled triangle, the sides relate to the angles. For example, in a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. Specifically, the side opposite 30° is half the hypotenuse, and the side opposite 60° is (√3)/2 times the hypotenuse.

But here, angle C is 60°, so the side opposite angle C is AB, which is 14. Therefore, AB corresponds to the side opposite 60°, so that would be the longer leg. Then, the hypotenuse BC would be twice the shorter leg. Wait, let me recall:

In a standard 30-60-90 triangle:

- The side opposite 30° is the shortest leg, let's say 'a'.
- The side opposite 60° is 'a√3'.
- Hypotenuse is 2a.

But in our case, angle at C is 60°, so the side opposite angle C is AB = 14. Therefore, AB is the longer leg (opposite 60°), so AB = a√3, where a is the shorter leg. Wait, but which is which?

Alternatively, maybe I should assign variables based on the triangle. Let me denote:

Let’s call AB = c (hypotenuse?), but wait, no. Wait, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle, which is at A. Therefore, the hypotenuse is BC. Therefore, BC is the hypotenuse. So BC is opposite angle A (the right angle). So BC is the hypotenuse. Then, AB and AC are the legs.

Given that angle at C is 60°, so angle C is 60°, so the side opposite angle C is AB. Therefore, AB is opposite angle C, which is 60°, so AB is the longer leg. Then, AC is the shorter leg (opposite angle B, which is 30°). 

So in a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are:

- Shorter leg (opposite 30°): AC = a
- Longer leg (opposite 60°): AB = a√3
- Hypotenuse (BC): 2a

Given that AB = 14, which is the longer leg. Therefore:

AB = a√3 = 14 → a = 14 / √3. 

Then, the hypotenuse BC = 2a = 2*(14 / √3) = 28 / √3. Rationalizing the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by √3: (28√3)/3. So BC = (28√3)/3. 

But the question asks for y, which is the length of BC. Therefore, y = 28√3 / 3. Looking at the options, that's option B. 

Wait, let me verify once more. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assigning which side is which. Let me double-check:

Angle at C is 60°, so the side opposite angle C is AB. Therefore, AB is opposite 60°, making it the longer leg. Then, AC is opposite angle B (30°), so that's the shorter leg. Hypotenuse BC is opposite the right angle at A. 

Yes, that seems correct. So AB = longer leg = 14. So using the ratio, longer leg = √3 * shorter leg. So AB = √3 * AC → AC = AB / √3 = 14 / √3. Then hypotenuse BC = 2*AC = 28 / √3 = (28√3)/3. Therefore, y = BC = (28√3)/3. Which is option B. 

Alternatively, could I use the Pythagorean theorem? Let's see. If we know AB = 14, AC = x, BC = y. Since it's a right triangle at A, AB² + AC² = BC². 

From earlier, AB = 14, AC = 14 / √3. Then AB² = 196, AC² = (196)/3. Sum is 196 + 196/3 = (588 + 196)/3 = 784/3. Therefore, BC² = 784/3 → BC = sqrt(784/3) = 28/sqrt(3) = same as before, rationalized to 28√3/3. Yep, same result. 

Therefore, the correct answer is B.
