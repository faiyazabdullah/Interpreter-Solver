Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the given information:

1. Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,F)),8): So the length of DF is 8 units.
2. Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)),3): AB is 3 units.
3. RightAngle(Angle(B,C,E)): Angle at point C between points B, C, E is a right angle.
4. RightAngle(Angle(A,E,D)): Angle at point E between points A, E, D is a right angle.
5. Perpendicular(Line(D,E),Line(E,C)): Lines DE and EC are perpendicular.
6. Parallel(Line(D,E),Line(F,B)): Lines DE and FB are parallel.
7. IsSideOf(Line(D,F),Rectangle(D,E,B,F)): Line DF is a side of rectangle DEBF.
8. IsSideOf(Line(A,B),Rectangle(D,E,B,F)): Line AB is a side of the same rectangle.
9. PointLiesOnLine(D,Line(D,F)): Point D is on line DF (which we already know since it's a side).
10. PointLiesOnLine(F,Line(D,F)): Similarly, F is on DF.

So, first, I need to visualize or sketch the figure based on these. Since there's a rectangle mentioned, DEBF. Wait, rectangles have opposite sides equal and all angles right angles. Also, the lines DE and FB are parallel. Also, lines DE and EC are perpendicular. Let me try to map this out.

Let me note down the points involved: D, E, B, F, A, C. 

From the rectangle DEBF: The rectangle has sides DE, EB, BF, FD. But wait, according to the IsSideOf predicates, Line(D,F) is a side of the rectangle, so DF is one side. Then Line(A,B) is another side of the same rectangle? Wait, but AB is a different line. Hmm, maybe the rectangle isn't DEBF directly. Wait, the rectangle is named DEBF? Or perhaps the rectangle is made up of those points?

Wait, the IsSideOf(Line(D,F), Rectangle(D,E,B,F)) implies that the rectangle has vertices D, E, B, F. So the rectangle is DEBF. Therefore, its sides are DE, EB, BF, FD. So DE and BF are opposite sides, and EB and FD are opposite sides. Also, since it's a rectangle, all angles are right angles. 

Now, Line(DE) is part of the rectangle, and Line(FB) is also part of the rectangle. Given that Line(DE) is parallel to Line(FB) (from the predicate Parallel(Line(D,E),Line(F,B))). That checks out because in a rectangle, opposite sides are parallel. 

Also, from the predicate Perpendicular(Line(D,E),Line(E,C)), meaning DE is perpendicular to EC. So line EC is perpendicular to DE. Since DE is a side of the rectangle, which is horizontal if we imagine the rectangle normally. Wait, but direction depends on the actual orientation. However, since DE is perpendicular to EC, and DE is a side of the rectangle, then EC must be vertical if DE is horizontal, or vice versa. 

Additionally, there's a right angle at Angle(A,E,D). So angle at E between A, E, D is a right angle. So EA is perpendicular to ED. Wait, since ED is part of the rectangle. Let me think about coordinates here. Maybe assigning coordinates to points would help.

Let me assign coordinates to make this easier. Let's assume point D is at (0,0). Since DF is a side of the rectangle and its length is 8, and assuming DF is horizontal, then point F would be at (8,0). Now, since DE is another side of the rectangle. In a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So DE is perpendicular to DF. Wait, but DF is horizontal, so DE should be vertical. Wait, but DE is connected to E. Let me think again.

Wait, if DE is a side of the rectangle DEBF, then DE connects D to E. Since DF connects D to F, and in the rectangle DEBF, the sides are DE, EB, BF, FD. So DE and BF are opposite sides, and EB and FD are opposite sides. Since DE is perpendicular to EC, and EC is connected to E. Let me consider coordinates again.

Let me fix coordinate system:

Let’s set D at (0,0). Since DF is length 8, and assuming DF is along x-axis, then F is at (8,0). Now, since DE is a side of the rectangle, and DE is perpendicular to EC. Also, the angle at E between A, E, D is a right angle (Angle(AED)). So AE is perpendicular to ED. Since ED is from E to D, which is from E to (0,0). Suppose E is at some point (x,y). Then vector ED is (-x, -y). Vector EA would be from E to A, which needs to be perpendicular to ED. So their dot product is zero.

But also, there's a right angle at B, C, E. So angle BCE is a right angle. And there's a right angle at AED. Also, Line DE is perpendicular to EC, which suggests that EC is perpendicular to DE. So EC is perpendicular to DE. Which would mean that EC is aligned with the direction of EB? Because in the rectangle, DE is connected to E, and EB is another side. Wait, in the rectangle DEBF, the sides adjacent to E are DE and EB. So DE is one side, EB is another. Since DE is perpendicular to EC, which would imply that EC is colinear with EB? Or maybe EC is extending from E in some direction. 

Alternatively, since DE is perpendicular to EC, and DE is a side of the rectangle, then EC is perpendicular to DE, implying that EC is either along EB or some extension. Let me think. If DE is vertical, then EC would be horizontal. But need more precise info.

Alternatively, perhaps constructing coordinates step by step.

Assume D is at (0,0), F is at (8,0). Since DE is a side of the rectangle DEBF. Let me suppose that E is at (0, y), making DE vertical. Then since DE is vertical, EC is horizontal (since DE ⊥ EC). So EC is horizontal from E. Then, point C would be somewhere along the horizontal line passing through E. 

Also, there's a right angle at Angle(B,C,E), meaning that angle at C between B, C, E is a right angle. So BC is perpendicular to CE. Since CE is horizontal, then BC must be vertical. So point B is vertically above or below C. But B is also part of the rectangle DEBF. Since in the rectangle DEBF, the sides are DE, EB, BF, FD. So point B is connected to E and to F. Wait, since DEBF is the rectangle, then moving from D to E to B to F to D. So if D is (0,0), E is (0,y), then B would be at (something, something). Wait, since DE is vertical from D(0,0) to E(0,y). Then EB would be horizontal to the right to point B. So from E(0,y) to B(x,y). Then from B(x,y) to F, which should connect back to D(0,0). Wait, but F is at (8,0). So the rectangle would have sides DE (vertical), EB (horizontal), BF (diagonal?), but wait, no. For it to be a rectangle, BF must be vertical? No, because in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and parallel. So DE and BF are opposite sides. Since DE is vertical (from D(0,0) to E(0,y)), then BF should also be vertical. But F is at (8,0). So if BF is vertical, then B must be at (8, y'), where y' is such that BF is vertical. But F is at (8,0), so B would be (8, k), and BF would be vertical from (8,k) to (8,0). Then, the rectangle DEBF would have points D(0,0), E(0,y), B(8,k), F(8,0). Then the fourth side would be from B(8,k) to F(8,0), which is vertical, and from E(0,y) to B(8,k)? Wait, that doesn't form a rectangle unless k = y. Wait, for DEBF to be a rectangle, the sides DE and EB must meet at E at a right angle. So DE is vertical, EB must be horizontal. Hence, E(0,y) to B(8,y). Then from B(8,y) to F(8,0), which is vertical down. Then from F(8,0) to D(0,0), which is horizontal left. Wait, but then the rectangle would have sides DE (vertical), EB (horizontal), BF (vertical), FD (horizontal). But FD is from F(8,0) to D(0,0), which is horizontal. But then the rectangle would actually be a rectangle with width 8 units (DF) and height y units (DE). But then EB is horizontal from E(0,y) to B(8,y), which makes sense. So in this case, the rectangle DEBF has length DF=8 and DE=y. 

But then, there's another line AB, which is a side of the rectangle? Wait, the second IsSideOf says Line(A,B) is a side of the rectangle DEBF. Wait, that seems conflicting because AB is a separate line. Unless A is one of the rectangle's points? Wait, the rectangle is DEBF, so its vertices are D, E, B, F. So AB being a side of the rectangle would require that A is one of these points. But A is mentioned in other predicates like Angle(AED) and Angle(BCE). So maybe A is a new point outside the rectangle?

Wait, the problem mentions Line(A,B) is a side of the rectangle. Wait, the predicate IsSideOf(Line(A,B), Rectangle(D,E,B,F)). So Line(A,B) is a side of the rectangle. But the rectangle has sides DE, EB, BF, FD. So Line(A,B) must be one of these. Therefore, A and B must be two consecutive vertices of the rectangle. Looking at the rectangle DEBF, the sides are DE, EB, BF, FD. So if Line(A,B) is a side, then A and B must be two consecutive points among D, E, B, F. 

Looking at the given predicates:

- PointLiesOnLine(D,Line(D,F)): D is on DF.
- PointLiesOnLine(F,Line(D,F)): F is on DF.
- IsSideOf(Line(D,F), Rectangle(...)): So DF is a side of the rectangle, which we've considered.

Now, IsSideOf(Line(A,B), Rectangle(D,E,B,F)): So AB is a side of the rectangle. Therefore, AB must be one of the sides of the rectangle. The rectangle's sides are DE, EB, BF, FD. Therefore, AB must correspond to one of these. Since B is a vertex of the rectangle, and A is another point. So possibilities:

Case 1: AB corresponds to DE. Then A would be D and B would be E. But the line AB would be DE. But the line DE is already a side. However, the predicate says Line(A,B) is a side of the rectangle. So maybe A is D and B is E? But then Line(A,B) is DE, which is a side. But in that case, the LengthOf(Line(A,B)) would be equal to DE. But given that LengthOf(Line(A,B)) is 3. So DE would be 3. But earlier, we had DF as 8. Wait, but if DE is a side of the rectangle, then DE should be equal to BF, which is from B to F. If B is E, then BF would be from E to F. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think again.

Alternatively, AB could be EB. So if A is E and B is B, but that would make AB the same as EB. But the problem states that Line(A,B) is a side of the rectangle, so A and B must be two endpoints of a side. So if AB is a side, then A and B are two consecutive vertices of the rectangle. The rectangle has vertices D, E, B, F. So possible pairs:

- D-E (DE)
- E-B (EB)
- B-F (BF)
- F-D (FD)

Therefore, Line(A,B) must be one of these four. So possibilities:

1. A=D, B=E → DE
2. A=E, B=B → EB
3. A=B, B=F → BF
4. A=F, B=D → FD

But the given LengthOf(Line(A,B)) is 3. So whichever side AB corresponds to, its length is 3. Also, we know that LengthOf(Line(D,F)) is 8, which is FD. So FD is 8, so if AB were FD, then AB would be 8, but the given AB is 3. So that can't be. Therefore, AB must be one of DE, EB, or BF.

Now, considering that, let's see:

If AB is DE: then A=D, B=E. Then AB would be DE, whose length is equal to DE. Given that AB is 3, so DE is 3. But earlier, we thought DF was 8. In the rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So DE equals BF. So BF would also be 3. But DF is 8, which is another side of the rectangle. Wait, but in a rectangle, adjacent sides are of different lengths unless it's a square. So DF and DE would be adjacent sides. So DF is 8, DE is 3, making the rectangle have sides 8 and 3. Then BF would be equal to DE (3), and EB equal to DF (8).

But then there's the right angle at Angle(AED). If A is D, then Angle(AED) would be Angle(D,E,D), which doesn't make sense. Wait, Angle(AED) is the angle at E between A, E, D. So if A is D, then the angle would be between D-E-D, which is a straight line, not a right angle. So that's impossible. Therefore, AB cannot be DE.

Next possibility: AB is EB. So A is E, B is B. Then Line(A,B) is EB, which is a side of the rectangle. Its length is 3. So EB = 3. Then, since EB is a side of the rectangle, which is adjacent to DE. So DE is perpendicular to EB, as it's a rectangle. So DE and EB are perpendicular. Also, from the predicate, RightAngle(Angle(B,C,E)), which would be angle at C between B, C, E. Also, there's a RightAngle(Angle(A,E,D)), which is angle at E between A, E, D. If A is E, then that angle would be undefined. So that's not possible. Hence, AB cannot be EB.

Third possibility: AB is BF. So A is B and B is F. Then Line(A,B) is BF, which is a side of the rectangle. Its length is 3. So BF = 3. But BF is a side of the rectangle. Earlier, DF is 8, which is another side. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So DF = BE = 8, and DE = BF = 3. So DE = 3, BF = 3. Then, the rectangle has sides 8 and 3. So that works. Now, check if this fits with other conditions.

Now, looking at the RightAngle(Angle(A,E,D)): This is angle at E between A, E, D. If A is B, then this angle is angle at E between B, E, D. So angle BED. Since in the rectangle, BE is one side (length 3), and ED is another side (length 3?), wait no. Wait, in the rectangle, DE is one side. If DF is 8, then DE would be the other side. Wait, if DE is 3? Wait, earlier we said BF = 3 (since AB is BF and AB is 3). In the rectangle DEBF, DE and BF are opposite sides. So DE = BF = 3. Then, DF and EB are the other pair of sides, which are equal. DF is 8, so EB is 8. So the rectangle has sides of 3 and 8. 

Then, the angle at E between B, E, D is angle BED. Since BE is length 8 (as EB is 8), and ED is length 3. But angle BED is a right angle because it's a rectangle. Wait, yes! In a rectangle, all angles are right angles. So angle at E between B, E, D is indeed a right angle. So that satisfies the RightAngle(Angle(A,E,D)) if A is B. So that works. 

Thus, this scenario holds. So AB is BF, with A=B and B=F? Wait, no. Wait, Line(A,B) is BF. So A and B are the endpoints of BF. So A is B and B is F? Wait, no. Line(A,B) means points A and B. If Line(A,B) is BF, then A must be B and B is F? Wait, no. Line(A,B) is the same as Line(B,F) if A=B and B=F? Wait, no. Line(A,B) is the same as Line(B,A). So if Line(A,B) is BF, then A and B are the endpoints of BF. So one of them is B, the other is F. So either A=B and B=F, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe A is B and B is F? No. Wait, Line(A,B) is BF, so A and B are points such that the line segment between them is BF. So A could be B and B is F, but that would make the line BF. Wait, no. Let me clarify. The line segment BF connects points B and F. So if Line(A,B) is BF, then A must be B and B is F? No. Wait, Line(A,B) is the same as Line(B,F) if A=B and B=F? No, that's not possible. Alternatively, A is B and B is F? Not sure. Wait, maybe there's confusion here. Let me rephrase: The line segment AB is a side of the rectangle DEBF. So AB is one of the sides: DE, EB, BF, or FD. We determined that AB is BF. Therefore, points A and B must be the endpoints of BF. So one of them is B and the other is F. So A is B and B is F? No, that would mean A is B and B is F, but that's not possible. Wait, perhaps A is B and the other endpoint is F. So Line(A,B) is from A to B, which is BF. Therefore, A is B and B is F? No. Wait, this is getting tangled. Let me think differently. 

Since AB is a side of the rectangle DEBF, which has sides DE, EB, BF, FD. So AB must be one of those. We concluded that AB is BF. Therefore, the line segment AB is BF. Therefore, points A and B are the endpoints of BF. So one of them is B and the other is F. So either A is B and B is F, but that would mean A is B and B is F, which would mean A=F. But then the line AF is BF. So A is F, B is F? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps A is F and B is B? Wait, if AB is BF, then A must be F and B is B. So Line(A,B) is from F to B, which is BF. Yes! So A is F and B is B. Therefore, Line(A,B) is FB, which is the same as BF. So that works. 

In this case, the length of AB is the length of BF, which is 3. So BF = 3. Then, since BF is a side of the rectangle, and DF is another side of the rectangle with length 8. In the rectangle DEBF, opposite sides are equal. So DE = BF = 3, and DF = EB = 8. 

Now, with this setup, we can proceed. Let me try to find coordinates again. Let me assign coordinates based on this.

Set D at (0,0). F is at (8,0) because DF is 8. Since DE is a side of the rectangle, and DE is equal to BF = 3. Since DE is perpendicular to DF (because in the rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular), so DE is vertical. So E is at (0, y), where y is the length of DE, which is 3. Therefore, E is at (0,3). 

Now, the rectangle DEBF has points D(0,0), E(0,3), B(?), F(8,0). Since EB is a side of the rectangle, which is length 8. From E(0,3) to B, which is horizontal (since DE is vertical, EB must be horizontal to form the rectangle). So B is at (8,3). Because moving horizontally from E(0,3) by 8 units to the right gives B(8,3). Then from B(8,3) to F(8,0), which is vertical downward, length 3, matching BF = 3. 

So the rectangle DEBF has coordinates D(0,0), E(0,3), B(8,3), F(8,0). 

Now, the line AB is BF, which is from B(8,3) to F(8,0). Wait, but earlier we said AB is BF, so A is F and B is B? Wait, no. Wait, Line(A,B) is BF, so A is F and B is B. So point A is F(8,0), and point B is B(8,3). But in the problem statement, there's a point A and point B. Wait, but we already have point B as part of the rectangle. So maybe there's another point A? Wait, the problem includes point A in the Angle(A,E,D) and Angle(B,C,E). 

So point A is another point. Earlier, we thought that Line(A,B) is BF, so A is F and B is B. But then point A is F. However, the problem mentions Angle(A,E,D), which would be angle at E between A, E, D. If A is F, then this angle is angle at E between F, E, D. Let me check that. 

Point F is at (8,0), E is at (0,3), D is at (0,0). So angle at E between F, E, D would be the angle formed at E by connecting E to F and E to D. Let me calculate that angle. 

Vector EF goes from E(0,3) to F(8,0): (8-0, 0-3) = (8,-3). Vector ED goes from E(0,3) to D(0,0): (0-0, 0-3) = (0,-3). 

The angle between vectors EF and ED. To check if it's a right angle. The dot product of EF and ED is (8)(0) + (-3)(-3) = 0 + 9 = 9 ≠ 0. So the angle is not a right angle. But the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(A,E,D)). So this contradicts our assumption. Therefore, our previous conclusion that AB is BF leading to A=F is invalid. 

Hmm, so where did I go wrong? Let me backtrack. 

Earlier, I assumed that AB is BF, but that led to inconsistency with the RightAngle(Angle(A,E,D)). So perhaps my assumption that AB is BF is incorrect. Let me reconsider the possibilities. 

Alternative possibility: AB is EB. So Line(A,B) is EB. Then, LengthOf(Line(A,B)) is 3, which would mean EB = 3. But in the rectangle, EB is a side. Previously, DF was 8, so if EB is 3, then DF is 8, making the rectangle have sides 3 and 8. Then, DE would be equal to BF. Let me try again with this.

If AB is EB, then points A and B are E and B. So Line(A,B) is EB, which is from E to B. So A is E and B is B. Then, the length of EB is 3. So in this case, EB = 3. Then, since DF is 8, which is another side of the rectangle. So the rectangle has sides DE and EB as adjacent sides, so DE is perpendicular to EB. 

Now, checking the RightAngle(Angle(A,E,D)): Here, A is E, so the angle is at E between A (E), E, D. Which is undefined. So that can't be. Thus, AB cannot be EB. 

Another possibility: AB is FD. So Line(A,B) is FD. But FD has length 8, while the given LengthOf(Line(A,B)) is 3. Contradiction. So AB cannot be FD. 

Only remaining possibility is AB is DE. So Line(A,B) is DE. Then, A and B are D and E. So AB is DE, length 3. Then, DE = 3. But DF is 8. So in the rectangle, DE and DF are adjacent sides. So DE = 3, DF = 8. Then, the rectangle has sides 3 and 8. 

Now, check the RightAngle(Angle(A,E,D)). Here, A is D and B is E. So the angle at E between A (D), E, D. Wait, that's the angle at E between D, E, D, which is a straight line, not a right angle. So that's invalid. 

So none of the options seem to work. What's wrong here? Perhaps my initial assumption about the rectangle's structure is incorrect. Let me re-examine the given predicates.

Wait, the rectangle is called DEBF. So the rectangle has vertices D, E, B, F. So the order matters. It could be that the rectangle is arranged as D-E-B-F-D, forming a rectangle. But depending on the connections, the sides may vary. 

Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is D-E-F-B-D? Wait, but that would require certain conditions. 

Wait, let's think again about the perpendicularity. There's a predicate Perpendicular(Line(D,E), Line(E,C)). So DE is perpendicular to EC. Also, there's a RightAngle(Angle(A,E,D)), which is angle at E between A, E, D. So EA is perpendicular to ED. Since ED is part of the rectangle. 

If DE is a side of the rectangle, then ED is a side. So EA is perpendicular to ED. So EA is perpendicular to ED. So EA is perpendicular to DE. Which would mean that EA is parallel to EC, since DE is perpendicular to EC. 

Wait, because DE ⊥ EC, and EA ⊥ DE, so EA || EC. 

This suggests that points A, E, and C are aligned? Or maybe not necessarily. Wait, if two lines are both perpendicular to the same line, they are parallel. So if EA is perpendicular to DE, and EC is perpendicular to DE, then EA || EC. 

So EA is parallel to EC. 

Additionally, there's a RightAngle(Angle(B,C,E)), which is angle at C between B, C, E. So angle BCE is a right angle. So at point C, lines CB and CE are perpendicular. 

Also, from the Perpendicular(Line(D,E), Line(E,C)), so EC is perpendicular to DE. So EC is perpendicular to DE. 

Let me try to draw this mentally. Assume DE is horizontal. Then EC is vertical upwards from E. So point C is somewhere along the vertical line from E. 

Also, since EA is perpendicular to DE, which is horizontal, so EA is vertical. So point A is along the vertical line from E. 

Moreover, since EA || EC, and EC is vertical, then EA is also vertical. So point A is on the vertical line through E. 

Now, considering that, and the fact that Line(A,B) is a side of the rectangle DEBF. Let me try to reconstruct this.

Let me assign coordinates again. Let me place E at (0,0) for simplicity. Then, since DE is a side of the rectangle, and DE is perpendicular to EC. Let me define coordinates accordingly.

Let me choose E at (0,0). Since DE is a side of the rectangle, and DE is perpendicular to EC. Let me assume DE is horizontal. So D is at (-a, 0) for some a, and E is at (0,0). Then, EC is vertical upward from E, so point C is at (0, b) for some b. 

Now, since Line(A,B) is a side of the rectangle DEBF. Let me recall that the rectangle has vertices D, E, B, F. 

Given that, and knowing that DE is from D(-a,0) to E(0,0), and EC is from E(0,0) to C(0,b). Also, the rectangle DEBF must have sides DE, EB, BF, FD. 

So from E(0,0), the next side of the rectangle is EB. Since in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. DE is horizontal, so EB should be vertical. So from E(0,0), move vertically to B(0,c). Then, from B(0,c), move horizontally to F(d,c), and then from F(d,c) back to D(-a,0). Wait, but that would require FD to be a diagonal, which might not be straight. Wait, no. For it to be a rectangle, the sides must be straight and meet at right angles. So from B(0,c), moving horizontally to F. Let me think.

Actually, in the rectangle DEBF, the sides are DE, EB, BF, FD. So from E(0,0), moving along EB to B. Since DE is horizontal, EB should be vertical. So B is at (0, c). Then from B(0,c), moving in the direction opposite to DE to reach F. Since DE is from D(-a,0) to E(0,0), which is rightward. So BF should be parallel to DE, which is horizontal. So from B(0,c), moving horizontally to the right to F. Let me say F is at (k, c). Then FD connects F(k,c) back to D(-a,0). For this to be a rectangle, FD must be parallel to EB. Wait, EB is vertical, so FD should be vertical? No, in a rectangle, opposite sides are parallel. DE and BF are opposite sides; they should be parallel. DE is horizontal, so BF should also be horizontal. So from B(0,c), moving horizontally to F. Let me say F is at (b, c). Then FD connects F(b,c) to D(-a,0). For this to be a rectangle, FD should be parallel to EB, which is vertical. So FD should be vertical. But FD connects (b,c) to D(-a,0). For this to be vertical, the x-coordinate of F must be the same as D. So b = -a. Hence, F is at (-a, c). Then FD connects (-a,c) to D(-a,0), which is vertical, as desired. 

So now, the rectangle DEBF has points:

D(-a,0), E(0,0), B(0,c), F(-a,c). 

Now, the length of DE is from D(-a,0) to E(0,0): distance is a. The length of EB is from E(0,0) to B(0,c): distance is c. The length of BF is from B(0,c) to F(-a,c): distance is a. The length of FD is from F(-a,c) to D(-a,0): distance is c. So this forms a rectangle with sides a and c. 

Now, we know from the given that LengthOf(Line(D,F)) is 8. Line(D,F) is from D(-a,0) to F(-a,c), which is vertical, length c. So c = 8. 

Also, LengthOf(Line(A,B)) is 3. Line(A,B) is a side of the rectangle DEBF, which has sides DE, EB, BF, FD. So Line(A,B) must be one of these. 

Possible scenarios:

1. Line(A,B) is DE: length a = 3. 
2. Line(A,B) is EB: length c = 3. But c is 8, so no.
3. Line(A,B) is BF: length a = 3. 
4. Line(A,B) is FD: length c = 3. Again, c is 8, so no.

So possibilities are a = 3 or a = 3. So either DE or BF is length 3. 

Now, let's look at other predicates. 

We have Perpendicular(Line(D,E), Line(E,C)). Line(DE) is from D(-a,0) to E(0,0), which is horizontal. Line(EC) is from E(0,0) to C(0,b), which is vertical. So they are perpendicular, satisfying the condition. 

Also, RightAngle(Angle(A,E,D)): This is the angle at E between A, E, D. So this is the angle between EA and ED. Since ED is from E(0,0) to D(-a,0), which is horizontal to the left. So vector ED is (-a, 0). The angle at E between A, E, D is formed by EA and ED. So we need this angle to be a right angle. Therefore, EA must be perpendicular to ED. Since ED is horizontal, EA must be vertical. So point A lies along the vertical line through E(0,0). 

So point A is somewhere along the y-axis. Let's denote A as (0, m). 

Also, we have RightAngle(Angle(B,C,E)): This is the angle at C between B, C, E. So angle at C between B-C-E is a right angle. 

Point C is somewhere along the vertical line from E(0,0) since EC is vertical. Let me assume C is at (0, b). 

So, point C is at (0, b). Now, angle at C between B, C, E is a right angle. So lines CB and CE are perpendicular. 

Point B is at (0,c) = (0,8) since c=8. Point E is at (0,0). So line CE is from C(0,b) to E(0,0), which is vertical. Line CB is from C(0,b) to B(0,c) which is vertical if b and c are different? Wait, if C is at (0,b) and B is at (0,c), then line CB is vertical. So angle at C between B, C, E is between CB (vertical) and CE (also vertical), which would be a straight line, not a right angle. Contradiction. So something is wrong here. 

Ah, this suggests that my assumption about the location of C is incorrect. Wait, EC is perpendicular to DE, which is horizontal, so EC is vertical. But if C is on the vertical line through E, then CB is vertical, leading to angle at C being straight. But the predicate says it's a right angle. So this suggests that my current configuration is flawed. 

Where is the mistake? Let me revisit the perpendicularity. The predicate says Perpendicular(Line(D,E), Line(E,C)), so DE ⊥ EC. DE is horizontal, so EC must be vertical. So C lies somewhere on the vertical line through E. But then CB is also vertical, making angle at C between B, C, E a straight line, not a right angle. This contradiction indicates an error in assumptions. 

Perhaps my assignment of the rectangle's structure is incorrect. Let me try a different approach. 

Let me consider that the rectangle DEBF has sides DE and DF. Wait, but DF is given as length 8. If DE and DF are adjacent sides, then they are perpendicular. So DE ⊥ DF. 

But earlier, we had that DE ⊥ EC, and DF is part of the rectangle. Let me try this. 

Assume D is at (0,0), F is at (8,0), since DF = 8. DE is perpendicular to DF, so DE is vertical. So E is at (0, y). Then, since DE is a side of the rectangle DEBF, and DF is another side. So the rectangle has sides DE (vertical) and DF (horizontal). So the rectangle would extend from D(0,0) to E(0,y) to B(?, ?) to F(8,0). 

To form the rectangle, from E(0,y), we move horizontally to B(8,y), then down to F(8,0), then back to D(0,0). So the rectangle DEBF has points D(0,0), E(0,y), B(8,y), F(8,0). 

Now, Line(A,B) is a side of the rectangle. Possible sides are DE, EB, BF, FD. 

LengthOf(Line(A,B)) is 3. So if Line(A,B) is EB, which is from E(0,y) to B(8,y), length is 8. If it's BF, from B(8,y) to F(8,0), length is y. If it's FD, from F(8,0) to D(0,0), length is 8. If it's DE, from D(0,0) to E(0,y), length is y. 

So if Line(A,B) is BF, then y = 3. Or if Line(A,B) is DE, then y = 3. 

Let's try y = 3. So E is at (0,3). Then DE is 3, BF is 3. 

Now, check the other predicates. 

Perpendicular(Line(D,E), Line(E,C)): Line(DE) is vertical from D(0,0) to E(0,3). So Line(DE) is vertical. Line(EC) is perpendicular to DE, so it must be horizontal. So Line(EC) is horizontal from E(0,3). So point C is somewhere along the horizontal line through E. So C is at (c,3). 

Also, RightAngle(Angle(A,E,D)): This is the angle at E between A, E, D. So this is the angle between EA and ED. Since ED is from E(0,3) to D(0,0), which is downward vertical. So EA must be horizontal to make this a right angle. So point A is somewhere along the horizontal line through E. So A is at (a,3). 

Now, Line(A,B) is a side of the rectangle. If Line(A,B) is BF, then A is F and B is B? Wait, Line(A,B) is BF, so A and B are endpoints of BF. B is at (8,3), F is at (8,0). So Line(A,B) is from A to B, which is BF. So A must be F(8,0) and B is B(8,3). But then A is F, and B is B. But in this case, the angle at E between A, E, D is angle between A (F) and D. So vector EF is from E(0,3) to F(8,0): (8, -3). Vector ED is from E(0,3) to D(0,0): (0, -3). The angle between these vectors: 

Dot product: (8)(0) + (-3)(-3) = 9 ≠ 0. So not a right angle. Contradiction. 

Alternatively, if Line(A,B) is DE, then A is D and B is E. But then the angle at E between A (D), E, D is undefined. 

If Line(A,B) is EB, which is from E(0,3) to B(8,3), length 8. But given LengthOf(Line(A,B)) is 3, this is not possible. 

If Line(A,B) is FD, which is from F(8,0) to D(0,0), length 8. Also not 3. 

So this suggests that y cannot be 3. Wait, but if Line(A,B) is BF, then its length is y. So if y = 3, then it's 3. But in that case, the angle at E between A and D is not right. 

Wait, but if A is at (a,3), then Line(A,B) could be from A(a,3) to B(8,3), which is horizontal. So if Line(A,B) is this, then its length is 8 - a. But we need this length to be 3. So 8 - a = 3 => a = 5. So A is at (5,3). 

Then, Line(A,B) is from (5,3) to (8,3), length 3, which matches. 

Now, check the RightAngle(Angle(A,E,D)). A is at (5,3), E is at (0,3), D is at (0,0). The angle at E between A, E, D is the angle between EA and ED. 

Vector EA is from E(0,3) to A(5,3): (5, 0). Vector ED is from E(0,3) to D(0,0): (0, -3). These vectors are perpendicular since their dot product is (5)(0) + (0)(-3) = 0. Yes! So this satisfies the RightAngle(Angle(A,E,D)). Great!

Now, check the other predicate: RightAngle(Angle(B,C,E)). This is the angle at C between B, C, E. 

We have Line(EC) is horizontal from E(0,3), as per the Perpendicular(Line(DE), Line(EC)). So point C is somewhere along the horizontal line through E. Let's say C is at (c,3). 

Now, Angle(B,C,E) is the angle at C between B, C, E. So lines CB and CE. 

Point B is at (8,3). Point C is at (c,3). Point E is at (0,3). So line CE is from C(c,3) to E(0,3), which is horizontal left. Line CB is from C(c,3) to B(8,3), which is horizontal right. So angle at C between B, C, E is a straight line, which is 180 degrees, not a right angle. Contradiction again. 

What's wrong here? Ah, because if C is on the horizontal line through E, then CB and CE are collinear, making the angle at C straight. So this suggests that C is not on this line. Wait, but the predicate says Perpendicular(Line(D,E), Line(E,C)), so Line(EC) must be perpendicular to Line(DE). Line(DE) is vertical, so Line(EC) must be horizontal. Hence, C must lie on the horizontal line through E. 

This leads to the conflict. Where is the mistake? Let me re-examine the predicates. 

Wait, the predicate says Perpendicular(Line(D,E), Line(E,C)). So Line(DE) is from D to E, and Line(EC) is from E to C. They are perpendicular. Line(DE) is vertical, so Line(EC) must be horizontal. So C is on the horizontal line through E. 

But then Angle(B,C,E) is at C between B, C, E. If C is on the horizontal line through E, and B is at (8,3), then line CB is horizontal. Line CE is also horizontal, making the angle at C straight. So this violates the RightAngle(Angle(B,C,E)). 

This suggests there's a missing piece. Perhaps point C is not on the horizontal line through E? But that would contradict the perpendicularity. 

Wait, maybe I misinterpreted the direction of Line(EC). Let me double-check. 

Line(DE) is from D to E, which is vertical (from (0,0) to (0,3)). Line(EC) starts at E and goes to C, and is perpendicular to DE. So Line(EC) is horizontal. So C is anywhere on the horizontal line through E, i.e., y=3. 

But then, how to satisfy the RightAngle(Angle(B,C,E))? Maybe C is not on the line EB? Let me think. If C is not on the horizontal line, but somehow... No, because Line(EC) must be horizontal. 

Wait, maybe there's a typo in the problem? Or perhaps I missed a predicate. Let me check all given predicates again. 

Other predicates: Parallel(Line(D,E), Line(F,B)). So Line(DE) is parallel to Line(FB). Line(DE) is vertical, so Line(FB) must also be vertical. 

Line(FB) is from F(8,0) to B(8,3), which is vertical. Yes, this matches. So this is satisfied. 

So everything else is okay except for the Angle(B,C,E). How to resolve this? 

Maybe point C is not on the horizontal line? But that would violate the perpendicularity. Wait, unless Line(EC) is not starting at E? No, it starts at E. 

Wait, perhaps Line(EC) is not horizontal, but vertical? No, because Line(DE) is vertical, and they are perpendicular. So Line(EC) must be horizontal. 

Wait, unless Line(DE) is not vertical? Let me check. Line(DE) is from D(0,0) to E(0,3), which is
