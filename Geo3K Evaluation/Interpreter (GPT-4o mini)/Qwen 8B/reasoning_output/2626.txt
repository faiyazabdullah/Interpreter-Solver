MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a parallelogram ABCD. Wait, but first, I need to visualize the figure based on the given predicates. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

First, the lines mentioned are Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Line(D,A). That suggests that points A, B, C, D form a quadrilateral. Also, there's Line(B,D), so BD is another diagonal connecting B and D. Then there are two right angles specified: RightAngle(Angle(A,B,D)) and RightAngle(Angle(C,D,A)). Also, the lengths of AD is 10 units, and BD is 6 units. The question is about finding the area of parallelogram ABCD.

Wait, hold on. The problem says it's a parallelogram, so opposite sides are equal and parallel. But also, since there are right angles mentioned, maybe it's a rectangle? But rectangles have all angles as right angles, but here only two right angles are given. Hmm, maybe not a rectangle. Or perhaps it's a rhombus? Wait, no, because if it's a parallelogram with one right angle, then all angles would be right angles, making it a rectangle. But the given right angles are at different vertices. Let me think again.

Let me try to sketch mentally. Points A, B, C, D connected as AB, BC, CD, DA. Also, BD is a diagonal. The right angles are at ABD and CDA. So Angle at B in triangle ABD is a right angle, and angle at D in triangle CDA is a right angle. Wait, how does that fit into the parallelogram structure?

In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So if angle at B is a right angle, then angle at D should also be a right angle. But wait, the right angle given is at Angle(A,B,D) which is angle at B between A, B, D. Similarly, Angle(C,D,A) is angle at D between C, D, A. So those two right angles are at B and D respectively. Since it's a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. Therefore, angle at B equals angle at D. But if they're both right angles, then all angles would be right angles, implying it's a rectangle. However, the given lengths of AD is 10 and BD is 6. In a rectangle, diagonals are equal. But BD is 6, so AC should also be 6. But AD is a side, length 10. Wait, but in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal to sqrt(a² + b²), where a and b are the sides. But here, if AD is one side, say length 10, and BD is a diagonal of length 6. Wait, that seems impossible because in a rectangle, the diagonal should be longer than either side. But 6 is shorter than 10. So that contradicts. Therefore, my assumption that it's a rectangle must be wrong. Hence, the figure isn't a rectangle. Therefore, even though there are two right angles, the figure isn't necessarily a rectangle. Maybe it's a different type of parallelogram.

Alternatively, perhaps the given right angles are adjacent angles? For example, angle at B and angle at D are right angles. But in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So if one is 90 degrees, the next would be 90 degrees, making all angles 90 degrees. Which brings us back to the rectangle. So contradiction again. So something's wrong here. Therefore, maybe the figure isn't a parallelogram? But the problem states it is a parallelogram. Wait, maybe I misread the given information.

Wait, the problem says "parallelogram ABCD". So ABCD is a parallelogram. Therefore, opposite sides are equal and parallel. Also, the diagonals bisect each other. Now, given that, along with the right angles. Let me re-examine the right angles.

RightAngle(Angle(A,B,D)): This is the angle at point B formed by points A, B, D. So angle ABD is a right angle. Similarly, RightAngle(Angle(C,D,A)): angle ADC is a right angle? Wait, angle at D between C, D, A. So angle CDA is a right angle. So in the parallelogram, angle at B and angle at D are right angles. But in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. Therefore, angle at B equals angle at D. So both being right angles implies that angles at A and C are also right angles? Because consecutive angles are supplementary. Wait, if angle B is 90 degrees, then angle A is supplementary to angle B. Wait, in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So angle A + angle B = 180 degrees. If angle B is 90, then angle A is 90. Therefore, all angles are 90 degrees, making it a rectangle. But earlier, that leads to a contradiction with the diagonal length. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, maybe the diagonals aren't AC and BD? Wait, BD is given as a line segment. In a parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other. But if BD is a diagonal, then AC is the other diagonal. However, in the given data, BD has length 6, while AD is 10. If ABCD were a rectangle, then BD would be the diagonal, so BD^2 = AB^2 + AD^2. But AD is 10, BD is 6. So 6^2 = AB^2 + 10^2 → 36 = AB² + 100 → AB² = negative number. Impossible. Therefore, contradiction. So my initial assumption that ABCD is a parallelogram with those right angles must be incorrect? But the problem says it is a parallelogram. Therefore, there's a mistake in my reasoning.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the figure is not a rectangle, but a different kind of parallelogram where some angles are right angles. Wait, but in a parallelogram, if one angle is right, all are right. Unless... unless the given right angles are not the internal angles of the parallelogram. Wait, but Angle(A,B,D): points A, B, D. So that's angle at B between segments BA and BD. Not sure yet. Similarly, angle at D between DC and DA. Wait, maybe these are not the internal angles of the parallelogram. Let me clarify.

In a parallelogram ABCD, the internal angles are at each vertex. So angle at A is between AB and AD. Angle at B is between AB and BC. But the given angles are angle ABD (at B between AB and BD) and angle CDA (at D between CD and DA). So those are not the internal angles of the parallelogram. Instead, they are angles formed by the diagonal BD. So, for instance, in triangle ABD, angle at B is a right angle. And in triangle ADC, angle at D is a right angle.

So, considering that, the parallelogram ABCD has a diagonal BD, splitting it into two triangles: ABD and CBD. Given that angle ABD is right, and angle CDA is right. Let me try to model this.

Since ABCD is a parallelogram, AD is equal to BC, AB equals CD. Also, BD is a diagonal. Let me consider coordinates. Assign coordinates to the points to make calculation easier. Let me place point B at origin (0,0). Since angle at B (ABD) is right, so AB and BD are perpendicular. Let me assume AB is horizontal and BD vertical. Wait, but need to define coordinates properly.

Let me set coordinate system:

Let’s take point B at (0,0). Since angle ABD is a right angle, so vectors BA and BD are perpendicular. Suppose BA is along x-axis and BD along y-axis. Let me assign coordinates accordingly.

Let’s denote:

Point B: (0, 0).

Since angle ABD is right, so BA ⊥ BD. Let me suppose BA is along positive x-axis. Let me let BA have length 'a', so point A is at (a, 0). Then BD is along positive y-axis, with length 'b', so point D is at (0, b). Now, since ABCD is a parallelogram, vector AB equals vector DC, and vector AD equals vector BC.

Vector AB is from A to B? No, vector AB is from A to B? Wait, in standard terms, vector AB goes from A to B. Wait, but in the parallelogram, AB and DC are opposite sides. So vector AB equals vector DC. So coordinates:

Point A is (a, 0), Point B is (0,0). Vector AB is B - A = (-a, 0). Therefore, vector DC must also be (-a, 0). So point C is D + vector DC. Wait, vector DC is same as AB. So point D is (0, b). Vector DC = AB = (-a, 0). Therefore, point C = D + vector DC = (0, b) + (-a, 0) = (-a, b).

But then, in a parallelogram, point C should also be such that vector AD equals vector BC. Vector AD is D - A = (0 - a, b - 0) = (-a, b). Vector BC is C - B = (-a - 0, b - 0) = (-a, b). Yes, same as AD. So that works. So coordinates are:

A: (a, 0)

B: (0, 0)

D: (0, b)

C: (-a, b)

Now, check angle CDA is a right angle. Let me verify that. Point C is (-a, b), D is (0, b), A is (a, 0). So angle at D between points C, D, A. So vectors DC and DA.

Vector DC is C - D = (-a - 0, b - b) = (-a, 0).

Vector DA is A - D = (a - 0, 0 - b) = (a, -b).

For angle at D to be right, vectors DC and DA must be perpendicular. Their dot product should be zero.

Dot product of DC and DA: (-a)(a) + (0)(-b) = -a² + 0 = -a². For this to be zero, a must be zero, which can't be. Contradiction. So something's wrong here. My assumption that angle CDA is right leads to inconsistency. Where did I go wrong?

Ah! Wait, the given right angle is Angle(C,D,A), which is angle at D between points C, D, A. So vectors DC and DA emanate from D. Wait, vectors DC and DA. Wait, DC is from D to C, and DA is from D to A. Wait, no. The angle at D is between CD and DA. So vectors DC and DA. Wait, CD is from C to D, and DA is from D to A. Wait, the angle between CD and DA at point D. So vectors DC and DA? Or DC and DA?

Actually, the angle at D between C-D-A is formed by segments DC and DA. So vectors going from D to C and from D to A. So vectors DC and DA. Wait, vector DC is from D to C: C - D = (-a, 0) as before. Vector DA is from D to A: A - D = (a, -b). As above, their dot product is (-a)(a) + (0)(-b) = -a². To have right angle, this must be zero. So -a²=0 ⇒ a=0, which is invalid. Therefore, contradiction. So my coordinate setup leads to inconsistency. Therefore, my assumption about the placement of points may be wrong.

Hmm. What went wrong here? Maybe the way I placed the points. Let me reconsider the configuration.

Alternative approach: Maybe the right angles are not in the way I thought. Let me think again. The problem says RightAngle(Angle(A,B,D)), which is the angle at B between points A, B, D. So that's angle ABD. Similarly, RightAngle(Angle(C,D,A)) is angle at D between C, D, A, i.e., angle CDA. So in the parallelogram ABCD, angle ABD is right and angle CDA is right.

Earlier attempt led to inconsistency. Let me try another coordinate system. Let me assume that BD is a diagonal, and in triangle ABD, angle at B is right. Also, in triangle ADC, angle at D is right. Let me use coordinates again.

Let me place point B at (0,0). Since angle at B (ABD) is right, so AB and BD are perpendicular. Let me take AB along x-axis and BD along y-axis. Let me assign:

Point B: (0,0)

Point A: (a, 0) for some a > 0.

Point D: (0, d) for some d > 0.

Then BD has length √[(0-0)^2 + (d - 0)^2] = d. Given that LengthOf(BD) is 6, so d = 6. Thus, D is (0,6).

Now, since ABCD is a parallelogram, vector AB equals vector DC. Vector AB is from A to B: B - A = (-a, 0). So vector DC must also be (-a, 0). Point D is (0,6), so point C = D + vector DC = (0,6) + (-a,0) = (-a,6).

Now, check angle at D between C, D, A. That is, angle CDA. So points C(-a,6), D(0,6), A(a,0). Need angle at D between DC and DA to be right. 

Vector DC is from D to C: C - D = (-a - 0, 6 - 6) = (-a, 0).

Vector DA is from D to A: A - D = (a - 0, 0 - 6) = (a, -6).

Their dot product is (-a)(a) + (0)(-6) = -a². For this to be zero, we need a = 0, which is impossible. So again, contradiction. Same issue as before. Therefore, there's something wrong with this setup.

Wait, but the problem states that ABCD is a parallelogram. So maybe my assumption that AB is horizontal and BD vertical is causing issues. Let me try a different coordinate assignment.

Alternative idea: Maybe BD is not aligned with axes. Let me instead use vectors more carefully.

Given that ABCD is a parallelogram, so AB is equal and parallel to DC, and AD equal and parallel to BC.

Also, angle ABD is right, and angle CDA is right.

Let me consider triangle ABD: right-angled at B. So AB ⊥ BD.

Similarly, triangle ADC: right-angled at D. So DC ⊥ DA.

Wait, DC is equal to AB, and DA is equal to BC. So if DC ⊥ DA, then AB ⊥ DA. Because DC = AB, so direction of DC is same as AB. So AB ⊥ DA.

But in a parallelogram, DA is one of the sides. So AB ⊥ DA. Which means that in the parallelogram, adjacent sides AB and DA are perpendicular. So the parallelogram has AB ⊥ DA, meaning it's a rectangle. But earlier, that causes contradictions with the diagonal length.

But according to the problem, BD is 6 and AD is 10. If ABCD is a rectangle, then BD would be the diagonal. So BD² = AB² + AD². Given AD is 10, BD is 6. So 6² = AB² + 10² → 36 = AB² + 100 → AB² = -64. Impossible. Therefore, contradiction. Hence, there must be a miscalculation in assumptions.

Wait, but the problem says ABCD is a parallelogram. So maybe it's not a rectangle, but another type of parallelogram where AB ⊥ DA, but with BD not being the diagonal? Wait, no, BD is a diagonal. Wait, in a parallelogram, diagonals connect opposite vertices. So BD connects B to D, which are opposite vertices. So in a parallelogram, diagonals split it into two congruent triangles. But if AB ⊥ DA, then the parallelogram is a rectangle, leading to contradiction. So why does the problem state it's a parallelogram? There must be something wrong with my interpretation of the right angles.

Wait, maybe the right angles are not in the triangles ABD and ADC, but elsewhere? Let me double-check the angle definitions.

RightAngle(Angle(A,B,D)) refers to the angle at B between A, B, D. So yes, that's angle ABD. Similarly, RightAngle(Angle(C,D,A)) is angle at D between C, D, A, i.e., angle CDA. So those are the angles at B and D in the parallelogram.

But in that case, if angle ABD is right and angle CDA is right, then in the parallelogram, those angles are not the internal angles. Wait, internal angles of the parallelogram are at each vertex. So angle at B is between AB and BC, and angle at D is between CD and DA. But the given angles are different. So angle ABD is part of the parallelogram's structure but not its internal angle. Let me think about the relationship.

In parallelogram ABCD, angle at B is between AB and BC. But angle ABD is between AB and BD. So BD is a diagonal. Similarly, angle CDA is between CD and DA, which is part of the internal angle at D. Wait, no. At point D, the internal angle is between CD and DA. So angle CDA is indeed the internal angle at D. Wait, if angle CDA is a right angle, then the internal angle at D is 90 degrees. Similarly, angle ABD being right means that angle between AB and BD is 90 degrees. So how does this affect the rest of the parallelogram?

Let me try to draw this. Parallelogram ABCD. Diagonal BD splits it into triangles ABD and CBD. In triangle ABD, angle at B is right. In triangle ADC, angle at D is right. So triangle ABD is right-angled at B, and triangle ADC is right-angled at D. Let me analyze these triangles.

For triangle ABD: right-angled at B. So AB ⊥ BD. For triangle ADC: right-angled at D, so DC ⊥ DA. But since ABCD is a parallelogram, DC is equal to AB, and DA is equal to BC. So DC = AB, DA = BC. From triangle ADC being right-angled at D, DC ⊥ DA. So AB ⊥ DA. Hence, in the parallelogram, AB ⊥ DA. Which implies that the adjacent sides AB and DA are perpendicular, making the parallelogram a rectangle. But this leads to the diagonal BD being sqrt(AB² + DA²). Given DA is 10, BD is 6. So sqrt(AB² + 10²) = 6 → AB² = 36 - 100 = -64. Impossible. So contradiction again. So this suggests that the given conditions are conflicting? But the problem says it's a parallelogram, so there must be a resolution.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that triangle ADC is right-angled at D. Let me re-express the angle CDA. Angle CDA is the angle at D between points C, D, A. In the parallelogram, this is the internal angle at D. So if angle CDA is right, then the internal angle at D is 90 degrees. Similarly, angle ABD is the angle at B between A, B, D. This is not the internal angle at B. The internal angle at B is between AB and BC. So how is angle ABD related to the internal angle at B?

Let me consider triangle ABD. In the parallelogram, BD is a diagonal. So angle ABD is part of the internal angle at B. Let me denote the internal angle at B as θ. Then angle ABD is part of θ. But since ABCD is a parallelogram, the sum of the internal angles at B and D is 180 degrees (since consecutive angles are supplementary). But if angle at D is 90 degrees (from angle CDA), then angle at B is 90 degrees. Hence, the internal angle at B is 90 degrees. So angle ABD is part of that 90-degree angle. But since triangle ABD is right-angled at B, then angle ABD is 90 degrees, which would mean that the entire internal angle at B is 90 degrees. Hence, the parallelogram has internal angles at B and D as 90 degrees, making it a rectangle. But again, this leads to the contradiction with the diagonal length.

This suggests that there's an error in the problem statement or my understanding. Alternatively, perhaps the given lengths are not of the sides but of the diagonals? Wait, the given LengthOf(Line(A, D)) is 10. AD is a side of the parallelogram. Because in the parallelogram, AD is one of the sides. So AD is a side, length 10. And BD is a diagonal, length 6. But if it's a rectangle, BD should be the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs AD and AB. But that gives impossible results.

Wait, maybe the problem is not stating that ABCD is a parallelogram, but rather that it's a quadrilateral named ABCD, which happens to be a parallelogram. Or maybe the given conditions allow for a non-rectangle parallelogram with those right angles. How?

Let me try to think differently. Since ABCD is a parallelogram, so AB || CD and AD || BC. Also, AB = CD, AD = BC.

From the right angles: angle ABD is right, and angle CDA is right.

Let me consider triangle ABD: right-angled at B. So AB ⊥ BD.

Triangle ADC: right-angled at D. So DC ⊥ DA.

But DC is equal to AB, and DA is equal to BC. So DC ⊥ DA implies AB ⊥ DA. Hence, AB ⊥ DA. So in the parallelogram, AB and DA are perpendicular. Hence, it's a rectangle. But again, leading to contradiction with the diagonal length.

Wait, but maybe the diagonal BD is not the one connecting B to D? No, the problem says Line(B, D), so BD is a diagonal.

Wait, but perhaps the given length of AD is not the side but something else? No, AD is a side of the parallelogram. The problem says Equals(LengthOf(Line(A, D)), 10), so AD = 10. And Equals(LengthOf(Line(B, D)), 6), so BD = 6.

But if AD is 10 and BD is 6, and in the parallelogram, AB ⊥ DA, then BD is the diagonal. Let me calculate BD using Pythagoras. If AB and DA are perpendicular, then BD² = AB² + AD². But BD is 6, AD is 10. So 6² = AB² + 10² → AB² = 36 - 100 = -64. Impossible. Hence, contradiction. So this suggests that the given conditions are inconsistent. But the problem exists, so there must be a way.

Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again about the triangles. In triangle ABD, right-angled at B, so AB² + BD² = AD²? Wait, no. In a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides. Here, angle at B is right, so hypotenuse is AD. Wait, no. In triangle ABD, the right angle is at B, so the hypotenuse is AD. So AD² = AB² + BD². Given AD = 10, BD = 6. So 10² = AB² + 6² → AB² = 100 - 36 = 64 → AB = 8. Ah! Wait, this is possible. Earlier, I incorrectly assumed that BD was the hypotenuse, but actually, in triangle ABD, the hypotenuse is AD, because the right angle is at B. So AD is the hypotenuse.

Therefore, AB² + BD² = AD² → AB² = AD² - BD² = 10² - 6² = 100 - 36 = 64 → AB = 8. So AB = 8.

Now, since ABCD is a parallelogram, AB = CD = 8, AD = BC = 10. Now, what about the other diagonal AC? In a parallelogram, the area can also be computed as base × height, or as |AB × AD| (cross product). But since we have right angles, maybe it's simpler.

But we also have the other right angle at D in triangle ADC. Let me check if that holds. In triangle ADC, right-angled at D. So DC² + DA² = AC². Wait, no. In triangle ADC, right-angled at D, so DC and DA are the legs, and AC is the hypotenuse. Wait, but DC is equal to AB = 8, DA is 10. So AC² = DC² + DA² = 8² + 10² = 64 + 100 = 164 → AC = √164 = 2√41. But I don't know if this helps directly.

However, the area of the parallelogram can be found as base × height. Alternatively, since it has a right angle at B in triangle ABD, which is a right triangle, and since ABCD is a parallelogram, the area could be twice the area of triangle ABD. Let me see.

Area of triangle ABD is (AB × BD)/2 = (8 × 6)/2 = 24. Since the parallelogram consists of two such triangles (ABD and CBD), the total area would be 2 × 24 = 48. But wait, but triangle ABD is half of the parallelogram? No, in a parallelogram, the diagonal divides it into two congruent triangles. So if BD is a diagonal, then area of ABCD is 2 × area of ABD = 2 × 24 = 48. Hence, the area is 48. Which is option C.

But wait, earlier I thought there was a contradiction with the other right angle, but now with AB = 8, DA = 10, BD = 6, and triangle ADC being right-angled at D, let me check if that holds.

In triangle ADC, DC = AB = 8, DA = 10. If it's right-angled at D, then DC² + DA² should equal AC². But AC is the diagonal. But we don't know AC. However, in a parallelogram, the diagonals satisfy the formula: AC² + BD² = 2(AB² + AD²). Let me check this.

Given AB = 8, AD = 10, BD = 6. Then AC² + 6² = 2*(8² + 10²) → AC² + 36 = 2*(64 + 100) → AC² + 36 = 2*164 → AC² = 328 - 36 = 292 → AC = √292 ≈ 17.09.

But in triangle ADC, which is supposed to be right-angled at D, AC² should be DC² + DA² = 8² + 10² = 164. But according to the parallelogram law, AC² is 292, which doesn't match 164. So this is a contradiction. What's wrong here?

Wait, the assumption that triangle ADC is right-angled at D. If angle CDA is right, then triangle ADC should be right-angled at D. But according to the parallelogram law, AC² = 292, and DC² + DA² = 64 + 100 = 164 ≠ 292. Hence, contradiction. So why is this happening?

Because the given condition that angle CDA is right is conflicting with the other conditions. But the problem states that all these conditions are true. So there must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, let's re-examine the triangle ADC. If angle at D is right, then in triangle ADC, angle at D is right. So AD and DC are the legs, and AC is the hypotenuse. So AC² = AD² + DC² = 10² + 8² = 164. But from the parallelogram's diagonal relation, AC² + BD² = 2(AB² + AD²). Substituting BD = 6, AB = 8, AD = 10:

AC² + 6² = 2*(8² + 10²) → AC² = 2*(64 + 100) - 36 = 2*164 - 36 = 328 - 36 = 292. But from triangle ADC, AC² = 164. Contradiction. So this suggests that the given conditions are inconsistent. But the problem is presented as solvable, so where is the error?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the angle CDA. Is angle CDA the right angle? Let me recheck. The predicate is RightAngle(Angle(C,D,A)), which is angle at D between C, D, A. So it's angle ADC. In the parallelogram, angle ADC is one of the internal angles. So if it's right, then the parallelogram has a right angle at D. But since it's a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So if angle at D is 90 degrees, then angle at C is also 90 degrees, and angles at A and B are also 90 degrees. Hence, it's a rectangle. But in that case, diagonals are equal, so AC = BD. But BD is 6, so AC should also be 6. But from the previous calculation, AC² = 164, so AC = 12.649… which is not 6. Contradiction again. 

Wait, but earlier, we found AB = 8 from triangle ABD. If the parallelogram is a rectangle, then AB and AD are perpendicular, so AB = 8, AD = 10, and diagonal BD should be sqrt(8² + 10²) = sqrt(164) ≈ 12.8, but the given BD is 6. So this is impossible. So there's a contradiction. But the problem is given, so there must be a way. Where is the error?

Wait, maybe the right angle at D is not the internal angle. Wait, angle CDA is the internal angle at D. So if it's right, then the parallelogram has a right angle at D. Hence, it's a rectangle. But then BD would be diagonal, which should be sqrt(AB² + AD²). But given BD = 6, and AD = 10, this is impossible. So the only way this works is if the given conditions are not consistent, but the problem says to find the area. Hence, perhaps the correct answer is derived from the triangle ABD, giving area 2×24=48, ignoring the contradiction with the other right angle. Or perhaps there's a different way to compute the area.

Wait, the area of the parallelogram can also be calculated as base × height. If we take AD as the base, length 10, then the height would be the distance from B to AD. But since angle ABD is right, and AB is perpendicular to BD, which is the height? Wait, in triangle ABD, which is right-angled at B, the height from B to AD is the same as BD? No, BD is one leg of the triangle. Wait, in triangle ABD, right-angled at B, the area is (AB × BD)/2 = (8 × 6)/2 = 24. Since the parallelogram consists of two such triangles, the total area is 48. So regardless of the other conditions, if we accept that, then the area is 48, which is option C.

Even though there seems to be a contradiction with the other right angle, perhaps the problem assumes that only the given conditions are valid, and the contradiction is due to a miscalculation. Alternatively, maybe the second right angle is not in the way I thought. Let me try to imagine the figure with AB=8, AD=10, BD=6, and angle CDA is right. Even though mathematically it seems contradictory, maybe the area is still computable via the first triangle.

Alternatively, perhaps the area is calculated as AB × AD × sin(theta), where theta is the angle between AB and AD. In this case, since angle ABD is right, and AB ⊥ BD, but how does that relate to theta?

Wait, in the parallelogram, theta is the angle between AB and AD. If AB ⊥ BD, and BD is a diagonal, then maybe we can express BD in terms of AB and AD.

In a parallelogram, the length of diagonal BD can be calculated using the formula:

BD² = AB² + AD² - 2 AB AD cos(theta)

Where theta is the angle between AB and AD. But in our case, we have a right angle at B in triangle ABD. Let me try to derive this.

In triangle ABD, right-angled at B, so BD² + AB² = AD² → BD = sqrt(AD² - AB²). Given AD = 10, BD = 6, so:

6² = 10² - AB² → AB² = 100 - 36 = 64 → AB = 8, as before.

Now, using the parallelogram diagonal formula:

BD² = AB² + AD² - 2 AB AD cos(theta)

Substitute known values:

6² = 8² + 10² - 2*8*10*cos(theta)

36 = 64 + 100 - 160 cos(theta)

36 = 164 - 160 cos(theta)

Rearranged:

160 cos(theta) = 164 - 36 = 128

cos(theta) = 128 / 160 = 0.8

Thus, theta = arccos(0.8) ≈ 36.87 degrees.

Now, the area of the parallelogram is AB * AD * sin(theta) = 8 * 10 * sin(arccos(0.8)).

Since cos(theta) = 0.8, sin(theta) = sqrt(1 - 0.64) = sqrt(0.36) = 0.6.

Hence, area = 8 * 10 * 0.6 = 48. So the area is 48, matching the earlier calculation. 

Now, regarding the other right angle at D in angle CDA. Let me check if this is compatible. In the parallelogram, angle at D is theta', which is supplementary to angle at B. Wait, no. In a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So if angle at B is theta, then angle at D is 180 - theta. Wait, but earlier, we had angle at D being part of the right angle in triangle ADC. Wait, no. The angle at D in the parallelogram is the internal angle, which is 180 - theta. But the given condition is that angle CDA is right, which is the internal angle at D. So this implies that the internal angle at D is 90 degrees. Hence, 180 - theta = 90 → theta = 90 degrees. But earlier, we found theta = arccos(0.8) ≈ 36.87 degrees. Contradiction again. 

So this suggests that the given conditions are conflicting. But since the problem asks for the area, and using the first triangle gives area 48, which is one of the options, and the contradiction might be due to an error in interpreting the angle CDA. Perhaps the right angle at D is not the internal angle, but another angle? Or maybe the problem has a typo? 

Alternatively, perhaps the given right angle at D is not the internal angle. Let me recheck. Angle CDA is at D, between C, D, A. In the parallelogram, this is the internal angle at D. Hence, it should be 90 degrees. But according to our calculation, it's 180 - theta ≈ 180 - 36.87 = 143.13 degrees, which is not right. Hence, contradiction.

But if we force angle at D to be 90 degrees, then theta = 90 degrees, so cos(theta) = 0. Hence, from the diagonal formula:

BD² = AB² + AD² - 2 AB AD cos(theta) → BD² = 64 + 100 - 0 = 164 → BD = sqrt(164) ≈ 12.8, but given BD is 6. Contradiction. Hence, no solution.

But the problem must have a solution. Hence, the only possibility is that the area is 48, derived from the triangle ABD, and the other condition is either redundant or there's a different interpretation. Perhaps the right angle at D is not the internal angle, but another angle. For example, if angle CDA is not the internal angle but another angle formed by the diagonal. Let me think.

Wait, angle CDA is the angle at D between C, D, A. In the parallelogram, this is the internal angle at D. But if we consider the diagonal AC, it might create other angles. But the given angle is at D between C, D, A, which is the internal angle. So it must be 90 degrees. 

Given this contradiction, but the area calculation from triangle ABD giving 48 is consistent with the given lengths, and it's one of the options, I'll proceed with that. Hence, the area is 48, so the answer is C.
