====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out the perimeter of this parallelogram. So first, I need to recall what a parallelogram is. It's a quadrilateral with opposite sides equal and parallel. Also, opposite angles are equal, and consecutive angles are supplementary. But wait, there are some given angle measures here. Let me note down all the given information.

First, Parallelogram(A,B,C,D). So the vertices are A, B, C, D in order, making AB parallel to CD and AD parallel to BC. Then there's a RightAngle at Angle(B,E,D). Hmm, point E isn't mentioned before. Wait, maybe E is another point connected? Let me check the other predicates.

Next, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,E,B)), 90). So angle at E between D-E-B is 90 degrees. Then Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)), 60). That angle at B between D-B-E is 60 degrees. And LengthOf(Line(C,D)) is 23, and LengthOf(Line(B,A)) is 16. So BA is 16 units long, and CD is 23 units. Since it's a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. So AB equals CD? Wait, AB is one side, and CD is the opposite side. Wait, but AB is given as 16, so CD should also be 16? But the given length of CD is 23. Wait, that seems conflicting. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the labeling.

Wait, maybe the points aren't labeled in order? Wait, the Parallelogram(A,B,C,D) usually implies the order A-B-C-D-A. So AB and DC are opposite sides, and AD and BC are the other pair. Therefore, AB should equal CD, and AD equals BC. But according to the given, LengthOf(Line(C,D)) is 23. If CD is a side, then AB should also be 23. However, they say LengthOf(Line(B,A)) is 16. That would mean AB is 16, but if CD is supposed to be equal to AB, then CD should also be 16. But the given says CD is 23. There's a contradiction here unless my understanding is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the labels are different. Maybe the parallelogram is A-B-C-D, so the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. Then AB is adjacent to BC, etc. So AB and CD are opposite sides. Therefore, AB = CD. But given that AB is 16 and CD is 23, that's impossible. Unless there's a mistake here. Wait, maybe the problem has a typo? Or perhaps I misread the given?

Let me recheck. The user wrote: Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,D)), 23) and Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,A)), 16). So Line(C,D) is CD, which in the parallelogram should be equal to AB. But AB is given as 16, CD as 23. Contradiction. Therefore, something's wrong here. Unless... Wait, maybe the points are not in order? Like, maybe the parallelogram is A-B-C-D, but the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So AB and CD are opposite. But if CD is given as 23, then AB should be 23, but it's given as 16. This inconsistency suggests that perhaps there's more going on with the diagram involving point E?

Wait, the problem mentions points E in the angles. So maybe E is a point inside the parallelogram or outside, forming some triangles. Let me think about the angles. There's a RightAngle at Angle(B,E,D), so angle BED is 90 degrees. Then MeasureOf(Angle(D,E,B)) is 90 degrees. Wait, angle at E between D-E-B is 90 degrees. And MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)) is 60 degrees. So angle at B between D-B-E is 60 degrees. 

So let me try to visualize this. Points B, E, D form a triangle where angle at E is 90 degrees, and angle at B is 60 degrees. Therefore, triangle BED is a right-angled triangle at E with angle at B being 60 degrees. Therefore, the third angle at D would be 30 degrees because angles sum to 180. So angle at D is 30 degrees. 

But how does this relate to the parallelogram? Let me consider the structure. In the parallelogram ABCD, we have sides AB and DC. Now, points B, D, and E are involved. Since angle at B is part of the parallelogram, but also part of triangle BED. Let me try to sketch mentally.

In parallelogram ABCD, AB is parallel to CD, AD is parallel to BC. Let me assume that E is a point such that BE connects to D, creating triangle BED. Given that angle at E is 90 degrees, angle at B is 60 degrees, and angle at D is 30 degrees. So triangle BED has angles 90°, 60°, 30°, making it a 30-60-90 triangle. 

In such a triangle, the sides are in ratio 1 : √3 : 2. Let me denote the sides. Let’s suppose that BE corresponds to the side opposite the 30° angle, which would be the shortest side. Wait, in triangle BED, angle at E is 90°, angle at B is 60°, so angle at D is 30°. Therefore, side opposite 30° is BE, opposite 60° is ED, and hypotenuse BD is opposite the right angle. 

Therefore, ratios: BE / sin(30°) = BD / sin(90°) = ED / sin(60°). Alternatively, since it's a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. So the sides opposite 30°, 60°, 90° are in that ratio. So BE is opposite 30°, so BE is half the hypotenuse. Wait, hypotenuse is BD. So BE = BD / 2. ED is BD*(√3)/2. 

Now, how do these relate to the parallelogram? Let me see. Point B is a vertex of the parallelogram, and D is another vertex. So BD is a diagonal of the parallelogram? Because in a parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other, but they aren't necessarily equal unless it's a rectangle. However, given that there's a right angle at E, maybe BD is split into two parts by E. 

Alternatively, maybe E lies somewhere along the diagonal BD? Let me think. Since angle BED is 90°, and E is connected to B and D. If E is on BD, then triangle BED would be degenerate, but since angle at E is 90°, E cannot be on BD. Hence, E must be a separate point. 

Alternatively, perhaps E is connected to B and D, forming triangle BED. So BE and DE are sides of the triangle, and BD is the hypotenuse. 

But how does this connect to the rest of the parallelogram? Let's consider the sides of the parallelogram. We know AB = 16 and CD = 23. But in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal, so AB = CD and AD = BC. But here AB is 16, CD is 23. That contradicts unless there's a miscalculation. 

Wait, perhaps the labels are different. Maybe the parallelogram is A-B-C-D, but the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So AB and CD are opposite sides. Therefore, AB must equal CD. However, the given data states that AB is 16 and CD is 23. That's inconsistent. Therefore, either there's an error in the problem statement, or I'm missing something. 

Wait, maybe the given LengthOf(Line(C,D)) refers to a different segment? For example, maybe CD is not a side of the parallelogram but a diagonal? No, in a parallelogram, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So CD is a side. 

Alternatively, could there be confusion between segments and other lines? For instance, maybe Line(C,D) is not the side CD but another line connecting C to D? Which it would be, as CD is a side. 

This contradiction suggests that perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the shape. Let me re-examine the given predicates. 

Another possibility: The parallelogram is A-B-C-D, but the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So AB is adjacent to BC, which is adjacent to CD, etc. So AB and CD are opposite sides, hence equal. Therefore, AB should equal CD. But given AB=16 and CD=23, which conflicts. Therefore, there's a contradiction unless E affects this somehow. 

Wait, perhaps the given LengthOf(Line(C,D)) is not referring to the side CD but another segment? For example, maybe it's CE or DE? Wait, no. The predicate is Line(C,D), so that's segment CD. 

Hmm. Maybe the problem involves a three-dimensional figure? Unlikely, as it's purely geometric with angles and lengths. 

Alternatively, maybe the parallelogram is not convex? Though even then, the side lengths should still be consistent. 

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the intended was LengthOf(Line(C,D)) is 16 and LengthOf(Line(B,A)) is 23? That would make sense. But assuming the problem is correct, I need to find another way. 

Alternatively, maybe the given LengthOf(Line(C,D)) is not CD but CB? No, CB would be the same as BC, which is adjacent to AB. 

Alternatively, perhaps the parallelogram is actually a rhombus? But no, in a rhombus all sides are equal, which again doesn't fit. 

Wait, maybe the given LengthOf(Line(C,D)) is not a side but a diagonal? Let me think. Suppose that BD is a diagonal. Then in that case, if BD is divided by point E into BE and ED, with certain lengths. 

Earlier, I considered triangle BED being a 30-60-90 triangle. If BD is the hypotenuse, then BE and ED can be determined. Let's try that. 

Assume that BD is the hypotenuse of triangle BED, with angles at E being 90°, angle at B being 60°, and angle at D being 30°. So in that case, the sides would be BE = BD * cos(60°) = BD * 0.5, and ED = BD * sin(60°) = BD * (√3)/2. 

But how does this relate to the parallelogram? Let me consider that BD is a diagonal of the parallelogram. In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, but they don't necessarily have to be perpendicular or anything. However, if we can express BD in terms of the sides of the parallelogram, we might find relations. 

But without knowing the angles of the parallelogram itself, it's hard to proceed. Wait, but the angles at B and D might be related. In a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. So if angle at B is 60°, then angle at D would be 180° - 60° = 120°, but wait, the given angle at D in triangle BED is 30°, which may not directly correspond. 

Alternatively, maybe angle at B in the parallelogram is related to the angle in triangle BED. Let me consider that angle at B in the parallelogram is composed of the angle from the parallelogram and the angle from triangle BED. 

Wait, the problem says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)), 60). So angle at B between D-B-E is 60 degrees. In the parallelogram, angle at B is between sides AB and BC. So if E is a point such that BE forms a 60-degree angle with BD, then perhaps angle between AB and BE is 60 degrees. 

Alternatively, maybe the entire angle at B in the parallelogram is 60 degrees? But in a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. So if angle at B is 60 degrees, then angle at A would be 120 degrees, etc. But how does that tie in with the triangle BED?

Let me try to model this. Suppose in the parallelogram ABCD, angle at B is 60 degrees. Then, since AB is adjacent to BC, and angle at B is between AB and BC. Now, if from point B, we draw BE such that angle between BD and BE is 60 degrees. Wait, but BD is a diagonal. Let me try to imagine. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle between BE and BC is 60 degrees? Not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps triangle BED is formed by extending some sides. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to use coordinates to model the problem. Let me assign coordinates to the points to calculate lengths and angles. 

Let me place point B at the origin (0,0). Since angle at B in triangle BED is 60 degrees, and angle at E is 90 degrees, maybe I can assign coordinates accordingly. 

Let me assume that BE is along the x-axis from B(0,0) to E(e,0). Then, since angle at E is 90°, ED should be vertical upwards from E. So point D would be at (e, f) for some f. 

Then, angle at B between D-B-E is 60 degrees. Vector BE is from B(0,0) to E(e,0), which is along positive x-axis. Vector BD goes from B(0,0) to D(e,f). The angle between BE (which is along x-axis) and BD is 60 degrees. 

The vector BD has components (e, f). The angle between BE (vector (e,0)) and BD (vector (e,f)) is 60 degrees. 

Using the dot product formula: cos(theta) = (BD · BE) / (|BD| |BE|).

BD · BE = e*e + f*0 = e².

|BD| = sqrt(e² + f²).

|BE| = e.

So cos(theta) = e² / (e * sqrt(e² + f²)) ) = e / sqrt(e² + f²).

Given theta is 60 degrees, so cos(theta) = 0.5.

Thus,

e / sqrt(e² + f²) = 0.5

Square both sides:

e² / (e² + f²) = 0.25

Multiply both sides by denominator:

e² = 0.25(e² + f²)

=> 4e² = e² + f² => 3e² = f² => f = e√3.

So coordinates of D are (e, e√3).

Now, the length of BD is sqrt(e² + f²) = sqrt(e² + 3e²) = sqrt(4e²) = 2e.

Also, in triangle BED, which is right-angled at E, so ED is vertical from E(e,0) to D(e,e√3), so ED has length e√3. BE is horizontal from B(0,0) to E(e,0), so BE has length e. BD is the hypotenuse, which is 2e. 

Now, considering the parallelogram ABCD. We need to relate this to the parallelogram's sides. Let me try to find coordinates of other points. 

Since ABCD is a parallelogram, vectors AB and DC are equal, and vectors AD and BC are equal. 

We already have points B(0,0) and D(e, e√3). Let me find coordinates for A and C. 

In a parallelogram, the midpoint of diagonals AC and BD coincide. The midpoint of BD is ((e/2), (e√3)/2). So the midpoint of AC must also be this point. 

Let me denote point A as (x,y). Then point C would be such that the midpoint of AC is ((x + c_x)/2, (y + c_y)/2) = (e/2, e√3/2). But without knowing coordinates of C, this might not help yet. 

Alternatively, since AB is a side of the parallelogram. From point B(0,0), moving to A(x,y), then vector AB is (x, y). Since AB is one side, and AD is another side from A(x,y) to D(e, e√3). Wait, but AD should be equal to BC. 

Alternatively, since in a parallelogram, vector AB equals vector DC. So vector AB is (x - 0, y - 0) = (x, y). Vector DC is C - D. If we can find coordinates of C, but I'm not sure yet. 

Alternatively, since ABCD is a parallelogram, point C can be found as B + vector AD. Vector AD is D - A. Wait, maybe better to use the fact that in a parallelogram, position vectors satisfy A + C = B + D. 

Yes, in a parallelogram, the sum of the position vectors of A and C equals the sum of the position vectors of B and D. So A + C = B + D. 

Assuming B is at (0,0), D is at (e, e√3). Let me denote A as (a,b), so C would be (B + D - A) = (0 + e - a, 0 + e√3 - b) = (e - a, e√3 - b). 

Now, the length of AB is given as 16. AB is from A(a,b) to B(0,0), so distance is sqrt((a)^2 + (b)^2) = 16. 

Similarly, the length of CD is given as 23. CD is from C(e - a, e√3 - b) to D(e, e√3). The vector CD is (e - (e - a), e√3 - (e√3 - b)) = (a, b). So the length of CD is sqrt(a^2 + b^2) = same as AB, which is 16. But the problem says CD is 23. This is a contradiction. 

Wait, this suggests that my assumption is wrong. Because according to the parallelogram properties, CD should be equal to AB, but here CD is given as 23 while AB is 16. This indicates an inconsistency. 

Unless my coordinate setup is incorrect. Perhaps point D is not (e, e√3)? Wait, earlier derivation showed that with angle conditions, D is at (e, e√3). 

Alternatively, maybe the given LengthOf(Line(C,D)) is not CD but another segment? Or perhaps there's a miscalculation here. 

Wait, let me check again. The length of CD is computed as sqrt(a² + b²), which equals AB. But the problem states that LengthOf(Line(C,D)) is 23, which would imply sqrt(a² + b²) = 23, but AB is given as 16. This conflict suggests that there's a fundamental issue. 

Perhaps the problem involves non-parallel sides? No, because it's specified as a parallelogram. 

Wait, maybe the given LengthOf(Line(C,D)) is not CD but another segment like CE or DE? Let me recheck the original predicates. 

The user wrote: Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,D)), 23). So yes, that's CD. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is not a standard parallelogram but a different type? No, the predicate says Parallelogram(A,B,C,D), which is a standard definition. 

At this point, I'm stuck because the given data seems contradictory. However, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the angles. Let me revisit the angle measures. 

The problem says: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,E,B)), 90). So angle at E between D-E-B is 90 degrees. Then Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,E)), 60). So angle at B between D-B-E is 60 degrees. 

Earlier, I assumed that triangle BED has angles 90° at E, 60° at B, and 30° at D. But in reality, the angle at D in triangle BED is not necessarily the same as the angle at D in the parallelogram. 

Wait, the angle at D in the parallelogram is angle ADC. How does that relate to the triangle? 

Maybe I need to consider that angle at D in triangle BED is part of the angle at D in the parallelogram. Let me think. 

In the parallelogram, angle at D is between sides CD and DA. If point E is somewhere such that DE is connected to B, then angle at D between CD and DE might be part of the overall angle. 

But without knowing the exact location of E, it's challenging. 

Alternatively, maybe the triangle BED is not within the parallelogram but external. 

Let me try to think differently. Since the problem gives us a parallelogram with certain angle measures involving point E, perhaps we can use those to find the lengths of the sides. 

Given that in triangle BED, which is a right-angled triangle at E, with angle at B being 60°, so it's a 30-60-90 triangle. As previously, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. 

Let me denote BE as the shorter leg, ED as the longer leg, and BD as the hypotenuse. 

So BE = x, ED = x√3, BD = 2x. 

Now, in the parallelogram ABCD, BD is a diagonal. Let me use the law of cosines on the parallelogram to relate the sides and the diagonal. 

In a parallelogram, the length of the diagonal can be found using the formula:

BD² = AB² + AD² - 2 * AB * AD * cos(angle at A)

Wait, but I don't know angle at A. Alternatively, since in a parallelogram, the sum of squares of the diagonals equals twice the sum of squares of the sides:

BD² + AC² = 2(AB² + AD²)

But I don't know AC. 

However, if I can express BD in terms of the sides and angles. 

Alternatively, since we have a right angle at E in triangle BED, and the angles in the triangle, perhaps we can relate the sides of the parallelogram to the sides of the triangle. 

But I'm still stuck. Let me try to use the given lengths. 

Suppose that BE is one of the sides of the triangle, and ED is another. Let me assume that BE is part of the parallelogram. For example, if BE is a side, but I don't know. 

Alternatively, since AB is 16, and CD is 23, perhaps these are the lengths of the sides of the parallelogram? But that would contradict the property of parallelograms having opposite sides equal. 

Wait, unless the parallelogram is not convex, or the given lengths are for different sides? 

Wait, maybe AB is one side, and CD is another side, but in a parallelogram, AB and CD are opposite and equal. Hence, if AB is 16, CD should be 16. But the problem says CD is 23. This is impossible unless there's a miscalculation. 

Wait, could there be a misunderstanding in the labeling of the parallelogram? For example, if the parallelogram is labeled A-B-C-D, but the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So AB and CD are opposite, BC and DA are opposite. So if AB is 16, CD should be 16. If CD is given as 23, that's conflicting. 

But the problem says Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,D)), 23). So CD is 23. So AB should be 23. But it's given as 16. This inconsistency suggests that either the problem is flawed, or I'm missing something critical. 

Wait, perhaps the given LengthOf(Line(C,D)) is not a side but a diagonal? Let me check. If BD is the diagonal, and in the triangle BED, BD is the hypotenuse. Earlier, we had BD = 2x, where x is BE. If I can find x, then I can relate it to the sides of the parallelogram. 

But how? Let me try to express the sides of the parallelogram in terms of x. 

Let me consider that in the parallelogram ABCD, AB = 16, and CD = 23. Wait, but this is impossible. So perhaps the given LengthOf(Line(C,D)) is not CD but CB? No, CB is the same as BC, which is adjacent to AB. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves a trapezoid instead of a parallelogram? But the predicate says Parallelogram(A,B,C,D). 

I'm really confused. Maybe I should proceed with the assumption that there is a miscalculation and try to find the perimeter despite the contradiction. 

Assume that AB = 16 and CD = 23, ignoring the parallelogram property. Then the perimeter would be 2*(AB + AD). But I don't know AD. 

Alternatively, since the angles involve a 30-60-90 triangle, perhaps the sides can be related via trigonometry. 

Let me consider that in triangle BED, with BE = x, ED = x√3, BD = 2x. Now, if BD is a diagonal of the parallelogram, and AB = 16, CD = 23, then using the law of cosines on the parallelogram's diagonal. 

For example, in a parallelogram, the length of diagonal BD can be expressed as:

BD² = AB² + AD² - 2 * AB * AD * cos(theta), where theta is the angle between AB and AD. 

But without knowing theta, this is difficult. However, if we can relate theta to the angles in the triangle. 

Alternatively, since angle at B in the parallelogram is related to the angle in triangle BED. 

Earlier, we had that angle at B between D-B-E is 60 degrees. In the parallelogram, angle at B is between AB and BC. If BE is a line from B to E, then perhaps the angle between AB and BE is 60 degrees. 

Assume that. Let me define angle between AB and BE as 60 degrees. 

Let me consider AB as a vector, and BE as another vector. If I can express BE in terms of AB and other sides, maybe I can find relations. 

But this is too vague. Let me try assigning coordinates again, but this time allowing for different lengths. 

Let me set point B at (0,0). Let me assume that AB is along the x-axis, so point A is at (16, 0) since AB = 16. Now, since it's a parallelogram, point D can be determined once we know the angle at B. 

Wait, but I don't know the angle at B. However, from the triangle BED, we know that angle at B is 60 degrees. So if angle between AB and BE is 60 degrees, and BE is a line from B(0,0) to E, then we can define E. 

Let me assume that BE makes a 60-degree angle with AB. So if AB is along the x-axis from B(0,0) to A(16,0), then BE makes a 60-degree angle upward from B. Let me define E as some point along that direction. 

Let me parameterize BE. Let's say BE has length k, so coordinates of E are (k*cos(60°), k*sin(60°)) = (k*(1/2), k*(√3/2)). 

Now, in triangle BED, angle at E is 90 degrees. So points B(0,0), E(k/2, k√3/2), and D. We need to find coordinates of D such that angle at E is 90 degrees. 

Vector EB is from E to B: (0 - k/2, 0 - k√3/2) = (-k/2, -k√3/2). Vector ED is from E to D: (dx - k/2, dy - k√3/2). These vectors should be perpendicular, so their dot product is zero. 

So:

(-k/2)(dx - k/2) + (-k√3/2)(dy - k√3/2) = 0

Expand:

-k/2 dx + k²/4 - k√3/2 dy + (k² * 3)/4 = 0

Combine terms:

-k/2 dx - k√3/2 dy + k²/4 + 3k²/4 = 0

Which simplifies to:

-k/2 dx - k√3/2 dy + k² = 0

Divide both sides by k:

-1/2 dx - (√3)/2 dy + k = 0

Or:

dx + √3 dy = 2k

So this is the equation that D(x, y) must satisfy. 

Additionally, since ABCD is a parallelogram, vector AB equals vector DC. Vector AB is (16, 0). Vector DC is (cx - dx, cy - dy). Wait, D is (dx, dy), C is (cx, cy). But since ABCD is a parallelogram, vector AB = vector DC. So:

cx - dx = 16

cy - dy = 0 → cy = dy

Also, vector AD = vector BC. Vector AD is (dx - 16, dy - 0) = (dx - 16, dy). Vector BC is (cx - 0, cy - 0) = (cx, cy). So:

dx - 16 = cx

dy = cy

From above, cx = dx - 16 and cy = dy. 

Now, point D(dx, dy) must satisfy dx + √3 dy = 2k. 

But we also know that the length of CD is 23. CD is from C(cx, cy) to D(dx, dy). Since cx = dx - 16 and cy = dy, vector CD is (dx - cx, dy - cy) = (16, 0). Wait, that means CD has length sqrt(16² + 0²) = 16. But the problem says CD is 23. Contradiction again! 

This suggests that no matter how I arrange this, CD comes out as 16, conflicting with the given 23. 

This indicates that there is a fundamental inconsistency in the problem's given data. However, since this is a problem to solve, perhaps there's a misinterpretation. Maybe the given LengthOf(Line(C,D)) is not CD but another segment. 

Wait, the problem says Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,D)), 23). Maybe Line(C,D) refers to a different line, like CE or DE? Or perhaps it's a typo and should be Line(C,B) or something else? 

Alternatively, perhaps the parallelogram is not ABCD but another configuration. For example, maybe it's A-B-D-C? No, that wouldn't make sense. 

At this point, I think there must be a mistake in the problem statement, but since I need to provide an answer, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the given lengths are for different sides. 

Let me suppose that AB = 16 and AD = 23, making the perimeter 2*(16+23) = 78. But that would be choice D. But why would AD be 23? 

Alternatively, if CD is 23, and AB is 16, but in a parallelogram, AB = CD, so this is impossible. Hence, perhaps the given LengthOf(Line(C,D)) is actually AD? If so, then AD = 23 and AB = 16, giving perimeter 2*(16+23)=78. Choice D. 

But this requires assuming that Line(C,D) refers to AD, which is not standard. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem meant Line(C,B) = 23, which would be CB = 23, making AD = 23, and AB = 16, leading to perimeter 2*(16+23)=78. 

Given that 78 is one of the options, and assuming that there was a mix-up in the labels, I'll go with this. Hence, the perimeter is 78, choice D. 

But this is speculative. However, given the contradictions in the problem, this might be the intended path.
