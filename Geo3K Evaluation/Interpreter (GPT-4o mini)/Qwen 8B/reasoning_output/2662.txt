<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, the question is about finding the measure of arc IHJ in circle L. The given information includes several points and lines, some angles, and mentions that HK and IG are diameters. Let me start by breaking down the given predicates.

First, the circle is named L, so all the points mentioned—like I, H, J, K, G—are probably on this circle. The lines LI, LH, LJ, LK, LG are all radii because they're stated as being part of the circle L. Wait, the predicates say that each of these lines (Line(L,I), Line(L,H), etc.) is a radius of the circle L. That means points I, H, J, K, G are all on the circumference of circle L, since they are endpoints of radii. 

Now, the problem says that HK and IG are diameters. Since a diameter passes through the center of the circle, and since the center here is point L (because all those lines are radii starting at L). So, if HK is a diameter, then points H and K are endpoints of a diameter, meaning they are directly opposite each other across the center L. Similarly, IG is another diameter, so points I and G are also endpoints of a diameter. Therefore, the line segments HK and IG both pass through the center L.

Next, there's an angle mentioned: Angle(H,L,J) which is given. Also, there's a right angle at Angle(G,L,J), which suggests that lines LG and LJ are perpendicular. Wait, Angle(G,L,J) is a right angle, so that would mean that the lines LG and LJ form a right angle at point L. But since LG and LJ are both radii, that implies that triangle GLJ is a right-angled triangle at L. Hmm, but wait, since L is the center, and G and J are points on the circle, then LG and LJ are radii, making them equal in length. So triangle GLJ is an isosceles right-angled triangle? Wait, but if it's a right angle at L, then yes, legs LG and LJ are equal, so the hypotenuse would be GJ. But maybe that's not directly relevant yet.

Also, there's an equality: MeasureOf(Angle(H,L,G)) equals 59 degrees. So angle at point L between points H and G is 59 degrees. Wait, angle HLG is 59 degrees. Let me visualize this. Points H and G are connected via line HG, but since both are on the circle, and L is the center. So angle HLG is formed by two radii, HL and GL. So that angle is at the center of the circle, so it's a central angle. The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc. So angle HLG = 59 degrees would correspond to arc HG measuring 59 degrees.

But wait, the question asks for the measure of arc IHJ. Arc IHJ... Hmm, arcs are typically measured as the sum of adjacent arcs. So arc IHJ would be the arc from I to H to J. Wait, but how does that work? Maybe it's the arc passing through points I, H, J. Let me think. In a circle, an arc can be denoted by three points if it's more than a semicircle, but usually, arcs are named by their endpoints. However, since the problem specifies "m∠IHJ", which is likely the measure of the arc IHJ. Wait, actually, the notation m∠IHJ refers to the measure of the angle at point H, between points I, H, J. Wait, no—the original question says "Find m ∠I H J." Wait, the user wrote "m \widehat I H J" which is the measure of arc IHJ. Wait, sometimes the hat over the letters denotes the arc. So the question is asking for the measure of arc IHJ.

Wait, but in standard notation, the arc symbol is over the three points, but maybe it's referring to the arc from I to J passing through H. So we need to find the measure of arc I-H-J. Let me confirm that understanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, but assuming that it's asking for the measure of arc IHJ, which would be the arc from I to J passing through H. Alternatively, maybe it's the arc from I to J, but depending on the position of H. Let me proceed step by step.

Since all points are on the circle centered at L, and we have diameters HK and IG. Let me try to sketch mentally the diagram. Let me note that:

- Since HK is a diameter, points H and K are opposite each other through L. Similarly, points I and G are endpoints of another diameter. Therefore, line IG is a straight line passing through L, with I and G on opposite ends.

Given that, let's consider the positions of the points. Let me assign coordinates temporarily for clarity. Suppose the circle has center L at origin (0,0). Let me assume coordinates for simplicity. For example, suppose:

- Let’s take point I at (1,0). Then since IG is a diameter, point G would be at (-1,0).

Similarly, since HK is a diameter, if I choose coordinates for H and K. Let me pick H at (0,1) and K at (0,-1). But that may not align with other given angles. Alternatively, perhaps better to use angles based on the given data.

But maybe instead of coordinates, think in terms of angles around the center L. Since all points are on the circle, their positions can be represented by angles from the center.

We know that angle HLG is 59 degrees. So the central angle between H and G is 59 degrees. Let me recall that the measure of arc HG is equal to the measure of central angle HLG, which is 59 degrees. Therefore, arc HG measures 59 degrees.

Additionally, since IG is a diameter, points I and G are endpoints of a diameter. Therefore, the central angle between I and G is 180 degrees. Because a diameter divides the circle into two semicircles of 180 degrees each. Therefore, the arc from I to G is 180 degrees.

Moreover, since HK is a diameter, points H and K are endpoints, so the arc from H to K is 180 degrees.

Now, the problem asks for the measure of arc IHJ. Let me parse this again. It could be interpreted as the arc from I to J passing through H. Or maybe the arc from I to J, considering the entire circle. But given the presence of H, it's likely that the arc goes through H. Wait, but where is point J?

Point J is one of the points on the circle, and we have the angle at L between H and J (Angle(H,L,J)) which is given? Wait, no. Wait, the given predicates mention Angle(H,L,J) – that's the angle at point L between points H and J. Wait, but that's a central angle. Because L is the center, so angle H-L-J is a central angle. So the measure of that angle is equal to the measure of arc HJ. So angle H-L-J is equal to arc HJ. Wait, but the problem doesn't give us the measure of that angle directly. Wait, unless there's something else. Wait, looking back at the predicates: There's a statement that Angle(H,L,J) is present. But the measure isn't given. However, there's another predicate: RightAngle(Angle(G,L,J)). Which means that angle at L between G and J is a right angle. So angle GLJ is 90 degrees. Therefore, the central angle between G and J is 90 degrees, implying that arc GJ measures 90 degrees.

So, putting together:

Arc GJ is 90 degrees (from angle GLJ being a right angle).

Arc HG is 59 degrees (from angle HLG = 59 degrees).

Arc IG is 180 degrees (since IG is a diameter).

Now, we need to find the measure of arc IHJ. Let me think about how these arcs relate.

Let me try to map out the positions of points I, H, J, G, K around the circle.

Starting with the diameter IG: points I and G are endpoints, so they are separated by 180 degrees. Let's fix that. Let me imagine placing point I somewhere on the circle, then G is directly opposite.

Then, there's another diameter HK. Points H and K are opposite each other.

Also, there's point J, such that angle GLJ is 90 degrees. So, from point G, moving along the circle 90 degrees towards J. Since angle GLJ is 90 degrees, which corresponds to arc GJ being 90 degrees.

Additionally, angle HLG is 59 degrees, so arc HG is 59 degrees.

Now, trying to figure out the position of point J relative to other points.

Let me consider the circle divided into arcs by these points. Let me attempt to calculate the total degrees around the circle.

Total degrees in a circle is 360.

We know:

- Arc IG is 180 degrees (diameter).
- Arc GJ is 90 degrees (central angle 90°).
- Arc HG is 59 degrees (central angle 59°).
  
But how do these arcs connect?

Assuming that points are placed in order around the circle. Let me try to arrange them.

Starting from point I, going clockwise:

- From I to G is 180 degrees (as IG is a diameter).
- From G to J is 90 degrees (arc GJ).
- So from I to J would be 180 + 90 = 270 degrees. But that seems too much. Wait, but that depends on the direction.

Alternatively, maybe the arrangement is different. Let me think.

Let me try to imagine the circle with center L. Let me place point I at (1,0), so G is at (-1,0) because IG is a diameter. Now, point J is such that angle GLJ is 90 degrees. So from point G (-1,0), moving 90 degrees around the circle to point J. Depending on direction, clockwise or counterclockwise. Let's assume counterclockwise for simplicity. Moving 90 degrees counterclockwise from G would bring us to point J located at angle 90 degrees from G. Since G is at (-1,0), adding 90 degrees counterclockwise would place J at (0,1) if moving counterclockwise. Wait, the coordinates would depend on direction. Alternatively, the central angle from G to J is 90 degrees, so if G is at (-1,0), then J would be at 90 degrees from G. Let me think of angles in standard position. Let me define the circle with center L at origin. Let me assign coordinates:

- Let me set up coordinate system with L at (0,0).

- Let me place point I at (1,0), so G is at (-1,0) since IG is a diameter.

- Now, angle GLJ is 90 degrees. So from point G (-1,0), the central angle to J is 90 degrees. So the direction from L to J is 90 degrees from the direction of LG. The vector from L to G is (-1,0), pointing to the left. Rotating this by 90 degrees counterclockwise would point upwards, so direction of J would be 90 degrees from G. So direction of LG is 180 degrees (pointing left). Adding 90 degrees counterclockwise would make the direction of LJ as 180 - 90 = 90 degrees? Wait, rotating the vector LG (-1,0) 90 degrees counterclockwise would give (0,1). So point J would be at (0,1). So coordinates of J are (0,1).

Now, we also have point H such that angle HLG is 59 degrees. That is, the central angle between H and G is 59 degrees. Since G is at (-1,0), and the central angle from H to G is 59 degrees. So the position of H can be found by rotating from G by 59 degrees. But direction matters. Let me clarify.

The central angle between H and G is 59 degrees. So depending on the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise), but since angles in circles are typically considered as the smaller arc unless specified otherwise. Assuming that the arc HG is 59 degrees, which is less than 180, so the shorter arc between H and G is 59 degrees. Therefore, point H is located 59 degrees away from G along the circumference.

Since G is at (-1,0), moving 59 degrees counterclockwise around the circle would place H. Let me compute the position of H. Starting from G at (-1,0), which is 180 degrees. Adding 59 degrees counterclockwise brings us to 180 + 59 = 239 degrees. So point H is at 239 degrees. Alternatively, if we move clockwise, subtracting 59 degrees from 180 gives 121 degrees. But since the arc is 59 degrees, which is the smaller arc, so depending on the configuration.

Wait, but the problem didn't specify the direction, so we have to consider both possibilities. However, since there's also a point J at (0,1) (which is 90 degrees from positive x-axis), and we need to find arc IHJ. Let's see.

Assuming that H is located 59 degrees counterclockwise from G. So G is at 180 degrees, so H is at 180 + 59 = 239 degrees. Then, the arc from H to G is 59 degrees. Alternatively, if it's the other way, H is at 180 - 59 = 121 degrees.

But we need to see how this fits with other points. Also, we have point J at 90 degrees (if we moved counterclockwise from G). Wait, earlier assumption was that J is at 90 degrees. Let me check again.

Earlier, we said that angle GLJ is 90 degrees, which is the central angle between G and J. So if G is at (-1,0), then J is 90 degrees away from G. So moving counterclockwise from G (which is 180 degrees), adding 90 degrees gives 270 degrees. Wait, no. Wait, the direction depends on the rotation. If we rotate the vector LG (which is pointing to G at (-1,0)) by 90 degrees counterclockwise, that would point upward, i.e., to the positive y-axis. So the angle for point J would be 90 degrees from the positive x-axis? Wait, no. Let me think carefully.

If the central angle from G to J is 90 degrees, then the angle between vectors LG and LJ is 90 degrees. Vector LG is pointing from L(0,0) to G(-1,0), which is along the negative x-axis. To get a 90-degree angle between LG and LJ, the vector LJ should be 90 degrees from LG. So if LG is pointing to the left (negative x-axis), then rotating 90 degrees counterclockwise would point upward (positive y-axis), so point J would be at (0,1). Alternatively, rotating clockwise would point downward (negative y-axis), giving point J at (0,-1). But since the problem involves point H and others, maybe the position of J is at (0,1) or (0,-1). However, without loss of generality, let's assume J is at (0,1) for this case.

So, if J is at (0,1), which is 90 degrees from positive x-axis. Then, let's consider the position of H. Earlier, we thought H is either at 121 degrees or 239 degrees. Let me explore both possibilities.

Case 1: H is at 121 degrees (i.e., 59 degrees clockwise from G). Since G is at 180 degrees, moving 59 degrees clockwise would put H at 180 - 59 = 121 degrees. So H is at 121 degrees.

Case 2: H is at 239 degrees (moving counterclockwise from G by 59 degrees).

Now, we need to find the measure of arc IHJ. Let me first understand what arc IHJ represents. It starts at I, goes through H, and ends at J. So it's the arc from I to J that passes through H. So the measure of arc IHJ would be the sum of arcs from I to H and H to J.

So, to calculate that, we need to find the measure of arc IH plus arc HJ.

But first, let's determine the positions of all points:

- I is at 0 degrees (assuming standard position; but earlier I placed I at (1,0), which is 0 degrees).

Wait, earlier I assumed I is at (1,0), which would be 0 degrees. Then G is at (-1,0), 180 degrees. J is at 90 degrees (if we rotated from G counterclockwise 90 degrees). Wait, no—if J is obtained by rotating LG (pointing left) 90 degrees counterclockwise, then J would be at 90 degrees from the positive x-axis? Wait, no. Wait, the direction of LG is from L to G, which is along negative x-axis. Rotating that 90 degrees counterclockwise would point toward positive y-axis. So the direction of LJ is along positive y-axis. Hence, point J is at (0,1), which is 90 degrees from positive x-axis. So the angle for point J is 90 degrees.

So, in this setup:

- I is at 0 degrees (coordinates (1,0)).
- G is at 180 degrees.
- J is at 90 degrees.
- H is either at 121 degrees (case 1) or 239 degrees (case 2).

Now, arc IHJ would be the arc from I (0 degrees) to J (90 degrees) passing through H. So depending on where H is.

In case 1: H is at 121 degrees. So the arc from I (0) to H (121) is 121 degrees, then from H to J (90 degrees)? Wait, but H is at 121 degrees, and J is at 90 degrees. Wait, if H is at 121 degrees, which is between I (0) and J (90)? No, 121 degrees is beyond 90 degrees. So the arc from I to J passing through H would go from I (0) → H (121) → J (90)? That doesn't make sense because J is at 90, which is before H. So that arc would loop around the circle. Alternatively, maybe the arc is the major arc, going the long way around. Let me think.

If H is at 121 degrees, which is between I (0) and G (180), then the arc from I to J passing through H would require going from I (0) to H (121), then continuing to J (90)? That doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the arc is the other way. Perhaps I made a mistake in assigning H's position.

Alternatively, if H is at 239 degrees (case 2), which is in the third quadrant. Then, the arc from I (0) to J (90) passing through H would go from I (0) → ... → H (239) → J (90)? But that would require going the long way around the circle, passing through H. Let me calculate the measure of that arc.

But maybe there's a better way. Let me think about the total circle. Let me try to find the measure of arc IHJ by figuring out the positions.

First, let's consider the arc from I to J. The shortest arc between I and J would be the minor arc, but since we have to go through H, it must be the major arc. So arc IHJ is the major arc from I to J passing through H.

To compute that, the measure would be 360 degrees minus the measure of the minor arc IJ.

So, if we can find the measure of minor arc IJ, then subtract from 360 to get the major arc IHJ.

How to find minor arc IJ?

Minor arc IJ is the smaller arc between I and J. Given that I is at 0 degrees, J is at 90 degrees. So the minor arc IJ is 90 degrees. Thus, the major arc IHJ would be 360 - 90 = 270 degrees. But that would be the case if H lies on the major arc IJ. However, if H is on the minor arc IJ, then the arc IHJ would be different.

But according to our previous analysis, point H is either at 121 degrees or 239 degrees. Let me check where those points are in relation to I and J.

If H is at 121 degrees, which is between I (0) and G (180), and J is at 90 degrees. So the arc from I to J passing through H would involve going from I (0) to H (121) to J (90)? That seems like a detour. Alternatively, maybe the arc is from I to H to J, which would require going from I to H (which is 121 degrees), then from H to J. But since J is at 90 degrees, which is behind H. So the arc from H to J would be going backward. This seems confusing. Maybe my initial assumption about the placement of H is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps H is at 239 degrees. Let's consider that scenario. So H is at 239 degrees. Then, the arc from I (0) to J (90) passing through H would go from I (0) → ... → H (239) → J (90). To compute the measure of this arc, we can add the arc from I to H and from H to J.

Arc from I to H: from 0 degrees to 239 degrees. The measure is 239 degrees (since it's the larger arc). Then, arc from H to J: from 239 degrees to 90 degrees. But this is going clockwise, so the measure would be 360 - 239 + 90 = 360 - 239 is 121, plus 90 is 211? Wait, no. When calculating arc measures, the direction matters, but the measure is always the smallest arc unless specified. However, in this case, the arc from H to J is going clockwise from H (239) to J (90), which would be 239 to 360 (which is 121 degrees), then from 0 to 90 (another 90 degrees), totaling 121 + 90 = 211 degrees. So total arc IHJ would be 239 + 211 = 450 degrees? Which exceeds 360, which is impossible. Clearly, there's confusion here.

This suggests that my approach to positioning the points may be flawed. Perhaps I need to reconsider the positions of the points based on the given angles and relationships.

Alternative approach: Instead of assigning coordinates, focus on the angles and arcs.

We know:

- Arc IG is 180 degrees (diameter).
- Arc GJ is 90 degrees (angle GLJ is right angle).
- Arc HG is 59 degrees (angle HLG is 59 degrees).

We need to find arc IHJ.

Let me try to express the positions of points in terms of arcs.

Start from point I. Since IG is a diameter, arc IG is 180 degrees. So from I to G is 180 degrees. Then, from G to J is 90 degrees (arc GJ). So from I to J, going through G, is 180 + 90 = 270 degrees. But that would be the arc from I to J passing through G, which is 270 degrees. But we need arc IHJ, which passes through H.

Now, arc HG is 59 degrees. So from H to G is 59 degrees. So if I can express the relationship between H and other points.

Let me try to draw the circle with points I, G, J, H.

From I to G is 180 degrees. From G to J is 90 degrees. So total from I to J via G is 270 degrees. But there's also point H such that arc HG is 59 degrees. So H is located 59 degrees away from G. So depending on the direction, H is either 59 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise from G.

Let me assume that H is located on the same side as J. Wait, but that depends on the direction. Let me think.

If we consider the arc from I to J via G as 270 degrees, then point H is somewhere near G. If arc HG is 59 degrees, then H is 59 degrees away from G. So if we go from G towards J (which is 90 degrees), then H is 59 degrees from G towards J. So the arc from G to H is 59 degrees, and from H to J is 90 - 59 = 31 degrees. Thus, the arc from I to H would be arc IG (180) minus arc GH (59) = 180 - 59 = 121 degrees. Then, arc from H to J is 31 degrees. So total arc IHJ would be arc IH + arc HJ = 121 + 31 = 152 degrees? But that doesn't match any of the options. Wait, but the question asks for arc IHJ, which might not be the sum of IH and HJ, but rather the entire arc from I to J passing through H.

Wait, but if H is between G and J, then arc IHJ would be arc from I to H to J. Which would be arc I to H (which is arc IG - arc GH = 180 - 59 = 121 degrees) plus arc H to J (which is 90 - 59 = 31 degrees), totaling 121 + 31 = 152 degrees. Not matching any answer choices. Hmm.

Alternatively, if H is on the other side of G, i.e., 59 degrees in the opposite direction from J. So, from G, moving 59 degrees away from J, which would be towards the other side. In this case, arc from G to H is 59 degrees, so from H to G is 59 degrees, and from G to J is 90 degrees. So if H is on the opposite side of G from J, then the arc from I to H would be arc IG (180) plus arc GH (59) = 180 + 59 = 239 degrees. Then, arc from H to J would be arc from H to G (59) plus arc from G to J (90) = 149 degrees. So total arc IHJ would be 239 + 149 = 388 degrees, which is impossible as it exceeds 360. So this can't be.

Hmm, this suggests that my assumptions are wrong. Let me re-examine.

Perhaps the arc IHJ is not the sum of IH and HJ, but the arc from I to J passing through H, which could be the major arc. Let me think differently.

Since we have several arcs:

- Arc IG = 180°
- Arc GJ = 90°
- Arc HG = 59°

Let me try to find the position of H relative to other points.

If arc HG is 59°, then H is located 59° away from G. So if we consider the circle, and knowing that arc GJ is 90°, then depending on the location of H, it could be on either side of G.

Case 1: H is on the same side as J relative to G. So, from G to J is 90°, and from G to H is 59°, so H is between G and J. Then, the arc from H to J is 90° - 59° = 31°.

Case 2: H is on the opposite side of G from J. So, from G to H is 59° in the opposite direction from J. Then, the arc from G to H is 59°, and from H to J would be 360° - arc from G to J - arc from G to H = 360 - 90 - 59 = 211°, which seems unlikely.

Now, let's consider Case 1 where H is between G and J. Then, the arc from I to H would be arc I to G (180°) minus arc G to H (59°), so 180 - 59 = 121°. Then, arc from H to J is 31°, so total arc IHJ is 121 + 31 = 152°, which is not among the options.

But the answer choices are A. 59, B. 135, C. 270, D. 301. None of these match 152. So something's wrong.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding the definition of arc IHJ. Perhaps it's not the arc passing through H, but another interpretation. Wait, in some contexts, the arc IHJ could refer to the arc from I to J that passes through H, which might be the major arc if H is positioned such that it's on the longer path.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the position of J relative to other points.

We also know that angle at L between H and J is Angle(H,L,J). Wait, the given predicates include Angle(H,L,J), but its measure isn't given. However, we also have a RightAngle(Angle(G,L,J)), which is 90 degrees. So angle GLJ is 90°, which we've already used.

Is there a way to relate angle H-L-J to other angles?

Let me think: At the center L, we have several angles:

- Angle GLJ = 90° (given)
- Angle HLG = 59° (given)
- What about angle HLI or other angles?

Since all points are on the circle, the sum of angles around point L should be 360°.

Let me consider the angles around point L. The angles at L are formed by connecting various pairs of points.

For example, we have:

- Angle HLG = 59°
- Angle GLJ = 90°
- What about angle ILH or others?

If we can find the measure of angle H-L-J, which is angle H-L-J, that would be the central angle between H and J. Once we know that, the arc HJ would be equal to that angle.

But how can we find angle H-L-J?

Well, if we can find the measure of angle H-L-J, then arc HJ is equal to that angle. Then, if we can express arc IHJ as arc I to H to J, which would be arc IH + arc HJ.

But how to find arc IH?

Alternatively, since we know arc IG is 180°, arc GJ is 90°, and arc HG is 59°, perhaps we can find relationships between these arcs.

Let me consider the full circle. Total degrees = 360.

We have:

- Arc IG = 180°
- Arc GJ = 90°
- Arc HG = 59°

But these arcs overlap. Let me try to visualize the circle with points I, G, J, and H.

Assume the points are arranged in the order I, H, G, J around the circle. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, think about the positions:

- I and G are endpoints of a diameter, so they are 180° apart.
- G and J are 90° apart.
- H and G are 59° apart.

So, if we imagine the circle, starting from I, going to G (180°), then from G to J is 90°, and from G to H is 59°. Depending on the direction of these arcs, the positions vary.

Assume that from G, the arc to J is 90° in one direction, and arc to H is 59° in the other direction. So the total circle would be composed of:

- Arc from I to G: 180°
- Arc from G to J: 90°
- Arc from G to H: 59°
- And the remaining parts.

But this seems overlapping. Let me try to find the position of H relative to other points.

Suppose we have point G. From G, moving 90° towards J gives us J. From G, moving 59° in the opposite direction gives us H. So the arc from H to G is 59°, and from G to J is 90°. So the arc from H to J is 59° + 90° = 149°? No, if H and J are on opposite sides of G, then the arc from H to J would be 59 + 90 = 149°. But then, how does this relate to other arcs?

Now, to find arc IHJ, which is the arc from I to J passing through H. This would be the arc from I to H to J. 

Let me calculate this arc. From I to H: since I to G is 180°, and from G to H is 59° in the opposite direction, so from I to H would be 180° + 59° = 239°. Then, from H to J is 149° as above. So total arc IHJ would be 239 + 149 = 388°, which is more than 360°, which is impossible. So this suggests inconsistency.

Alternatively, maybe the arc from I to H is not 239°, but something else. Let me rethink.

If H is on the opposite side of G from J, then from I to H would be arc I to G (180°) plus arc G to H (59°), giving 239°. Then, from H to J is arc H to G (59°) plus arc G to J (90°), giving 149°. Total arc IHJ is 239 + 149 = 388°, which is invalid. Hence, this suggests that H cannot be on the opposite side of G from J.

Therefore, H must be on the same side as J from G. So, from G, moving towards J (90°), and H is 59° from G in that same direction. So, from G to H is 59°, and from H to J is 90° - 59° = 31°. Now, arc from I to H would be arc I to G (180°) minus arc G to H (59°), giving 121°. Then, arc from H to J is 31°. So total arc IHJ is 121 + 31 = 152°, still not matching the options.

This indicates a fundamental error in my reasoning. Let me revisit the given information.

Wait, the question asks for m∠IHJ, which is the measure of the arc IHJ. Wait, but maybe I misread the question. Let me double-check.

Original question: "Find m ∠I H J."

Wait, the user wrote "m \widehat I H J", which in geometry notation denotes the measure of the arc IHJ. But sometimes, the arc symbol is written with three points, like arc IHJ, which would imply the arc from I to J passing through H. So that's what I've been working on.

But none of my calculations are yielding the answer choices. Let me think again.

Another approach: Use the fact that the measure of an arc is equal to the central angle subtending it. We know several central angles:

- Angle HLG = 59° ⇒ arc HG = 59°
- Angle GLJ = 90° ⇒ arc GJ = 90°
- Angle IGL? Wait, IG is a diameter, so arc IG = 180°

Now, we need to find arc IHJ. Let me think about how to express this arc in terms of known arcs.

Arc IHJ is the arc from I to J passing through H. So, it consists of arc IH and arc HJ.

To find arc IH, we need to know the measure of the central angle for arc IH. Similarly for arc HJ.

But how to find these?

Let me consider the circle's total degrees: 360°.

We know:

- arc IG = 180°
- arc GJ = 90°
- arc HG = 59°

Let me try to find the position of H relative to I.

If I can find the measure of arc IH, then I can add arc HJ to it.

But how?

Let me consider the entire circle. Let me try to express the arcs in terms of variables.

Let me denote:

- arc IH = x
- arc HJ = y
- arc JG = 90° (given)
- arc GI = 180° (given)

Wait, but arc JG is 90°, and arc GI is 180°. But arc JG and arc GI are parts of the circle. Let me think about how these arcs connect.

From point I, going to G is 180°. From G to J is 90°. So the arc from I to J via G is 180 + 90 = 270°. This is the major arc IJ. But there's also the minor arc IJ, which would be the other way around.

But we also have point H such that arc HG = 59°. So, from H to G is 59°. Let me try to express the relationship between arc IH and other arcs.

Assuming that the arc from I to H is part of the circle. Let me consider the arc from I to H as arc IH = ? Let me think about the positions.

If arc HG = 59°, and arc GJ = 90°, then depending on where H is, the arc IH can be determined.

If H is on the same side as J from G, then from G to H is 59°, and from H to J is 90° - 59° = 31°. So the arc from I to H would be arc I to G (180°) minus arc G to H (59°), giving 121°. So arc IH = 121°, and arc HJ = 31°, so total arc IHJ = 121 + 31 = 152°, which is still not in the options.

But none of the answer choices match this. So perhaps my assumption about the position of H is wrong.

Wait, maybe the arc IHJ is not the sum of IH and HJ, but something else. Let me think about the entire circle.

Total circle is 360°. If arc IG is 180°, arc GJ is 90°, and arc HG is 59°, then what about the remaining arcs?

Let me try to calculate the remaining arc.

Total circle = 360°

Sum of known arcs: arc IG (180) + arc GJ (90) + arc HG (59) = 180 + 90 + 59 = 329°. So remaining arc is 360 - 329 = 31°. Where is this remaining arc?

It could be the arc from J to I, which is the minor arc JI. But this is getting too abstract.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the positions of all points.

Let me try to use the fact that the sum of all arcs around the circle is 360°.

Assume the points are arranged in the order I, H, G, J, and possibly others.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's challenging.

Wait, let's think about the central angles at point L.

At point L, we have several angles:

- Angle HLG = 59° (between H and G)
- Angle GLJ = 90° (between G and J)
- What about other angles?

If we can find the measure of angle H-L-J, which is the angle at L between H and J, then that would be the central angle for arc HJ, and hence the measure of arc HJ.

Once we have arc HJ, and if we can find arc IH, then arc IHJ would be arc IH + arc HJ.

But how to find angle H-L-J?

Let me consider the full circle around point L. The sum of all central angles around point L is 360°.

We know two of them:

- Angle HLG = 59°
- Angle GLJ = 90°

What about other angles?

If we can find other angles, we can compute the missing ones.

For example, if we consider the angle between I and H, or between I and J, etc.

But we don't have direct info about those. However, we know that IG is a diameter, so the angle between I and G is 180°. Also, since IG is a diameter, and J is a point on the circle, the position of J relates to I and G.

Let me try to find the measure of angle H-L-J.

Angle H-L-J is the angle at L between points H and J. This is the central angle for arc HJ. Let me denote this angle as θ.

So, θ = measure of arc HJ.

Now, we can write equations based on the total circle.

We know:

- arc IG = 180°
- arc GJ = 90°
- arc HG = 59°
- arc HJ = θ
- What about other arcs?

Let me try to express the circle in terms of these arcs.

Assuming the points are arranged in the order I, H, G, J, and possibly others. Let's try to build the circle.

From I to G is 180° (diameter).

From G to J is 90°, so from G to J is 90°.

From H to G is 59°, so from H to G is 59°.

Now, the arc from H to J would be arc H to G (59°) + arc G to J (90°) = 149°, if H and J are on opposite sides of G. But this would mean arc HJ is 149°, so θ = 149°, making arc IHJ = arc IH + arc HJ.

But arc IH would be arc from I to H. How to find that?

If from I to G is 180°, and from G to H is 59°, then if H is on the same side as J from G, then from I to H is 180° - 59° = 121°. So arc IH = 121°, arc HJ = 149°, total arc IHJ = 121 + 149 = 270°. Which is option C!

Wait, this matches option C: 270 degrees.

But why did I previously think it wasn't? Because I had a conflicting calculation, but now this seems plausible.

Let me verify this.

If arc HJ is 149°, and arc IH is 121°, then total arc IHJ is 121 + 149 = 270°, which is option C.

But how did I arrive at arc HJ being 149°? By assuming that from H to G is 59°, and from G to J is 90°, so total from H to J is 59 + 90 = 149°, assuming H and J are on opposite sides of G.

Yes, if H is on one side of G, and J is on the other, then arc HJ would be 59 + 90 = 149°. And arc IH is 180 - 59 = 121°, since from I to G is 180°, and from G to H is 59°, so from I to H is 180 - 59 = 121°.

Thus, arc IHJ is 121 + 149 = 270°, which is option C.

But why did I previously think there was a conflict
