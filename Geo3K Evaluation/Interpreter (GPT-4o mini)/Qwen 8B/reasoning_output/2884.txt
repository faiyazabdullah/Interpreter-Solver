<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how to find BC given these variables. So, the problem gives me AB = 6, AF = 8, BC = x, CD = y, DE = 2y - 3, and FE = x + 10/3. The answer choices are A. 9, B. 10, C. 13.3, D. 15. 

First, I need to visualize this. Since there are points labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, it's probably a straight line or some connected segments. Maybe they're colinear? Let me think. If AB, BC, CD, DE, EF are parts of a single line, then maybe we can add up the lengths. But wait, AF is given as 8. If A to F is 8, and AB is 6, then BF would be AF - AB = 8 - 6 = 2? Or maybe not necessarily colinear? Hmm, but without seeing the diagram, it's tricky. However, since there are multiple segments mentioned, perhaps they form a broken line or a polygon. Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involved with these points.

Wait, let's consider the possibility that all points lie on a straight line. For example, A---B---C---D---E---F. Then AB + BC + CD + DE + EF would be the total length from A to F. But AF is given as 8. Let me check that. If AB = 6, BC = x, CD = y, DE = 2y - 3, and EF is x + 10/3. Then adding them up: AB + BC + CD + DE + EF = 6 + x + y + (2y - 3) + (x + 10/3). Simplify that: 6 - 3 + x + x + y + 2y + 10/3. That becomes 3 + 2x + 3y + 10/3. Convert 3 to 9/3, so total is 9/3 + 10/3 = 19/3 plus 2x + 3y. This equals AF = 8. So 2x + 3y + 19/3 = 8. Multiply both sides by 3: 6x + 9y + 19 = 24 → 6x + 9y = 5. Wait, that seems odd because 6x + 9y = 5. But x and y are lengths, so positive numbers. Is this possible? Maybe my assumption about the arrangement is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the points aren't all on the same line. Perhaps there are different segments. Let me think again. Another possibility is that points A, B, C, D, E, F form a polygon where some segments are connected. For instance, maybe AFE and other triangles. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging. However, the presence of FE suggests that F is connected to E. Also, AB and AF are given. Maybe there's a triangle involving these points?

Wait, another thought. Suppose there's a triangle AFE, with AB being part of it? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe AF is a diagonal, while AB is a side. Let me think of coordinates. Assign coordinates to points. Let me assume point A at (0,0), then B is somewhere. But this might take too long without more info.

Wait, the problem mentions BC = x, CD = y, DE = 2y - 3, FE = x + 10/3. Maybe there's a relationship between these segments. For example, if points B, C, D, E are colinear, then BC + CD + DE = BE. But also, FE is given. If E is connected to F, perhaps FE connects back to A? Or maybe there's a triangle where FE relates to other sides.

Alternatively, maybe there's a system of equations here. Since we have two variables x and y, maybe we can set up equations based on the given expressions. Let's suppose that the sum of certain segments equals others. For example, if AF is 8, and AB is 6, then BF could be AF - AB = 8 - 6 = 2. If B is between A and F, then BF = 2. Now, if points B, C, D, E are along BF, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe there's a segment from B to F passing through C, D, E. For example, B----C----D----E----F, making BF = BC + CD + DE + EF. Wait, but then BF would be x + y + (2y - 3) + (x + 10/3). Which simplifies to 2x + 3y -3 + 10/3. Which is 2x + 3y + (10/3 - 9/3) = 2x + 3y + 1/3. And BF is 2, so 2x + 3y + 1/3 = 2 → 2x + 3y = 2 - 1/3 = 5/3. But then again, this leads to 2x + 3y = 5/3, which seems very small. But maybe this is possible? However, with the answer choices being around 9-15, this seems conflicting. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another relation. For example, if DE = 2y - 3 and FE = x + 10/3, maybe there's a way to relate DE and FE through another equation. But unless there's more info, like triangles or parallel lines, it's hard to tell.

Wait, perhaps there's a triangle where FE and other sides are related. For example, if there's a triangle with sides involving FE and AB. But AB is 6, AF is 8. Maybe triangle AFE has sides AF=8, AE=?, FE=x+10/3. But without knowing AE, it's unclear.

Another idea: maybe the problem involves similar triangles or proportions. Suppose there are similar triangles where ratios can be set up. For example, if AB corresponds to something else. But again, without knowing the figure, it's speculative.

Wait, maybe the key lies in realizing that DE = 2y - 3 and FE = x + 10/3. If we can express DE in terms of FE or vice versa. But how?

Alternatively, maybe there's a linear relationship between the variables. Let me consider that if all the points are on a straight line, then maybe AF = AB + BC + CD + DE + EF. Wait, earlier calculation gave that AF = 8, and substituting the variables led to 2x + 3y + 19/3 = 8. But that didn't seem helpful. Let me recheck that.

Let me write down the expression again. If AF is the sum of AB + BC + CD + DE + EF, then:

AB = 6, BC = x, CD = y, DE = 2y -3, EF = x + 10/3.

So AF = 6 + x + y + (2y -3) + (x + 10/3)

Combine terms:

Constants: 6 - 3 + 10/3 = 3 + 10/3 = 9/3 + 10/3 = 19/3

Variables: x + x = 2x; y + 2y = 3y

Thus, AF = 2x + 3y + 19/3 = 8

Multiply both sides by 3: 6x + 9y + 19 = 24 ⇒ 6x + 9y = 5.

But this results in 6x + 9y = 5. This seems problematic because if x and y are lengths, they should be positive. Let me see: 6x +9y =5. Suppose x and y are positive, then possible? Yes, but how does this help us find x?

We need another equation to solve for x. Where would that come from? There must be another relationship between x and y. Maybe from another part of the problem. But the problem doesn't mention anything else. Unless there's a missing piece.

Wait, the problem says "Find BC" which is x. So we need another equation involving x and y. But where? Maybe there's an implicit assumption that some segments are equal or that certain points align in a particular way.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves a triangle where FE is related to other sides. For example, if there's a triangle with sides AB, AF, and FE, but that's just speculation.

Wait, maybe the points are arranged such that AF is divided into AB and BF, and BF includes BC, CD, DE, and EF. Wait, let's say A-----B-----C-----D-----E-----F. Then AF = AB + BC + CD + DE + EF. Which is what I considered before. But that leads to 6x + 9y =5. But that seems impossible unless x and y are fractions.

Alternatively, maybe the points are arranged differently. What if B, C, D, E are on one line, and F is another point connected to E? Like A-F-E-D-C-B-A? Not sure. 

Wait, another possibility: maybe AF is a transversal cutting across some lines, creating similar triangles. For example, if there are parallel lines, leading to proportional segments. But without knowing the exact figure, it's difficult.

Wait, maybe the problem involves a rectangle or parallelogram where opposite sides are equal. For example, if AB is one side, then maybe FE is another side? But AF is given as 8, and AB is 6. Not sure.

Alternatively, think of AF as a hypotenuse in a right triangle. For example, if there's a right triangle with legs AB and something else, giving AF as the hypotenuse. But again, not enough info.

Hmm, maybe I missed something. Let me go back. The problem gives AB = 6, AF = 8, BC = x, CD = y, DE = 2y - 3, FE = x + 10/3. The question is to find BC, which is x. So we need to find x. We have two variables x and y, so we need another equation. Where could that come from?

Maybe there's a relation between DE and FE? Like, if DE and FE are parts of a larger segment. For example, if D-E-F are colinear, then DF = DE + EF. So DF = (2y -3) + (x + 10/3) = x + 2y -3 + 10/3 = x + 2y + 1/3. But unless we know DF, we can't proceed. Alternatively, if D is connected to another point, but without more info...

Wait, perhaps there's a triangle involving points A, D, and F? If AD is a side, but again, no data.

Alternatively, maybe there's a ratio from similar triangles. Suppose there's a triangle where AB corresponds to FE or something. But without knowing angles or other sides, it's hard.

Wait, going back to the previous equation: 6x + 9y = 5. Let's see if there's another equation. Maybe from the fact that DE = 2y -3 must be positive. So 2y -3 > 0 → y > 1.5. Similarly, FE = x + 10/3 must be positive, which it is since x is positive. So that doesn't give us much.

Is there a chance that the original assumption about the arrangement is wrong? Maybe AF isn't the sum of all those segments. Perhaps there's another relationship. Let me think: if AF is a separate segment, maybe there's a triangle or trapezoid where AF is connected to other segments. 

Wait, here's an alternative approach: maybe use the given expressions to find a relation between x and y. Let's suppose that there's a relationship between the segments that allows us to set up another equation. For example, if points A, B, C, D, E, F form a polygon where certain sides are connected, or maybe there's a loop.

For example, imagine a pentagon ABCDE with a diagonal AF. But without knowing the structure, it's still unclear.

Alternatively, think of vectors. Suppose each segment is a vector, and AF is the resultant vector. But again, without knowing directions, it's not helpful.

Wait, maybe the problem is about a straight line with multiple points, and AF is a segment that skips some points. For example, A to F passes through B, C, D, E. So AF = AB + BC + CD + DE + EF. Wait, but that's the same as before. Which gives 6x + 9y = 5. But then we have one equation with two variables. How can we solve for x?

Unless there's another condition that implies y in terms of x. Maybe from the definition of DE = 2y -3. If DE is part of a segment that also includes FE, but I don't see the connection.

Wait, maybe there's an error in assuming the entire AF is the sum of AB + BC + CD + DE + EF. Maybe only part of it. For example, if A to B is 6, and then from B to F is another segment. But then AF would be AB + BF. If BF includes BC, CD, DE, EF, then BF = BC + CD + DE + EF. Which would mean BF = x + y + (2y -3) + (x + 10/3) = 2x + 3y -3 + 10/3 = 2x + 3y + 1/3. And since AF = AB + BF = 6 + BF = 8. Therefore, BF = 2. Hence, 2x + 3y + 1/3 = 2 → 2x + 3y = 2 - 1/3 = 5/3. Again, the same equation as before.

But with this equation, we have 2x + 3y = 5/3. Still one equation with two variables. Need another equation. Maybe there's something else implied? Like, maybe FE is related to another segment? Or perhaps there's a minimum value for DE? But DE = 2y -3 must be positive, so y > 1.5. But that doesn't directly help.

Wait, perhaps there's a typo in the problem, or maybe I misread it. Let me double-check the given information. The user wrote: "Find B C if A B = 6, A F = 8, B C = x, C D = y, D E = 2 y - 3, and F E = x + 10 / 3." So yes, that's correct.

Wait, maybe there's a triangle involving FE and AB? For example, if triangle AFE has sides AB, AF, and FE? But AB is 6, AF is 8, FE is x + 10/3. If it's a triangle, then the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. So for triangle AFE: AB + FE > AF? Or AF + FE > AB? Not sure, but this might not be applicable unless we know it's a triangle.

Alternatively, if there's a right triangle. For example, if angle at B is right, then AB² + BC² = AC², but without knowing AC, it's not helpful.

Alternatively, think of FE as part of another triangle. For example, if there's a triangle where FE is one leg, and something else is another leg. But again, not enough info.

Wait, maybe there's a proportion from similar triangles. Suppose there are two similar triangles where corresponding sides are in proportion. For example, if AB corresponds to FE, and AF corresponds to something else. Let's say triangles ABX and FEY are similar. But without knowing which triangles, it's guesswork.

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe there's an error in my initial assumption about the arrangement of the points. Let me try another approach.

Suppose the points are arranged such that A---B---C---D---E---F, forming a straight line. Then AF = AB + BC + CD + DE + EF. As before, which gives 6 + x + y + (2y -3) + (x + 10/3) = 8. Simplifying:

6 -3 + 10/3 + x + x + y + 2y = 8  
Which is 3 + 10/3 + 2x + 3y = 8  
Convert 3 to 9/3: 9/3 + 10/3 = 19/3  
So 19/3 + 2x + 3y = 8  
Subtract 19/3: 2x + 3y = 8 - 19/3 = 24/3 - 19/3 = 5/3  
So 2x + 3y = 5/3  

Now, I need another equation. Maybe there's a relation between y and x from another part of the problem. Wait, the problem mentions DE = 2y - 3. If DE is a segment on the line, maybe its length is related to another segment. For example, if DE is part of a different segment or if there's a relation between DE and FE. But how?

Alternatively, maybe there's a maximum or minimum constraint. For example, if DE must be positive, then 2y -3 > 0 => y > 3/2. But that alone doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that all the points are on a straight line and that there's another condition. For example, if E is the midpoint of some segment, but no info is given.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem, and the intended setup was different. For example, if AF is not the sum of all those segments, but instead, there's a different relationship. Let me think of another scenario.

What if A, B, C, D, E are collinear, and F is a point not on that line, such that AF = 8 and FE = x + 10/3? Then, perhaps using the Pythagorean theorem if there's a right angle. For example, if AF is perpendicular to the line containing A, B, C, D, E. Then, FE could be a hypotenuse. But this is too vague.

Alternatively, consider coordinates. Let's assign coordinates to the points. Let me place point A at (0,0). Assume that points B, C, D, E are on the x-axis. So B is at (6, 0) since AB = 6. Then C is at (6 + x, 0). D is at (6 + x + y, 0). E is at (6 + x + y + (2y -3), 0) = (6 + x + 3y -3, 0) = (3 + x + 3y, 0). Now, F is some point such that AF = 8. If F is also on the x-axis, then F would be at (8, 0), but then FE would be |8 - (3 + x + 3y)| = |5 - x - 3y|. According to the problem, FE = x + 10/3. So:

|5 - x - 3y| = x + 10/3

Since distances are positive, we can drop the absolute value by considering cases.

Case 1: 5 - x - 3y ≥ 0 → 5 - x - 3y = x + 10/3  
Rearranged: 5 - 10/3 = 2x + 3y → 5/3 = 2x + 3y  
Which is the same equation as before!

Case 2: 5 - x - 3y < 0 → -(5 - x - 3y) = x + 10/3 → -5 + x + 3y = x + 10/3 → -5 = 10/3 → which is false. So only Case 1 applies.

So we have 2x + 3y = 5/3. But we still need another equation to solve for x. 

Wait, but in this coordinate setup, where is F located? If F is on the x-axis at (8, 0), then FE is the distance from F(8,0) to E(3 + x + 3y, 0), which is |8 - (3 + x + 3y)| = |5 - x - 3y| = x + 10/3. Which gives us the equation above.

But we still have one equation with two variables. How can we resolve this? Perhaps there's an assumption that the points are arranged in a certain way that imposes another condition. For example, if there's a right angle at some point, or if another segment is defined.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to recognize that there's an error in the setup, but since this is a math problem, likely there's a way. Maybe I made a wrong assumption in placing F on the x-axis? If F is not on the x-axis, then FE could be a different length. But without knowing the position of F, it's impossible to calculate.

Wait, but the problem gives AF = 8. If A is at (0,0), then F could be anywhere on a circle of radius 8 centered at A. If E is at (3 + x + 3y, 0), then FE depends on where F is. But without more info, we can't determine FE. 

This suggests that my initial assumption about the arrangement is incomplete. Maybe the points are not all on the same line. Maybe there's a different configuration. 

Another idea: perhaps there are two separate lines, like A-B-C and A-F-E, with some connections. For example, if B, C, D, E are on one line and F is on another line connected to A. But without knowing, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, maybe there's a triangle involving FE and AB. For example, if FE is parallel to AB, creating similar triangles. If FE || AB, then the ratio of FE to AB would be the same as the ratio of corresponding segments. But without knowing the heights or other sides, it's unclear.

Alternatively, consider that AF = 8, AB = 6, and FE = x + 10/3. If there's a triangle AFE, then by the Law of Cosines, but we don't know the angle between AF and FE.

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe there's a missing piece of information or a misinterpretation of the problem. Given that the answer choices are numerical, and the options are A. 9, B. 10, C. 13.3, D. 15, perhaps there's an error in my setup.

Let me revisit the equation 2x + 3y = 5/3. If I assume that y is expressed in terms of x, but there's no way. Wait, unless there's another equation derived from the DE expression. DE = 2y -3. If DE is part of another segment, like DE = something else. But I don't have that.

Wait, maybe the problem is in a different language or translation, and "BC" refers to something else. Or maybe the labels are different. For example, maybe the points form a hexagon, and BC is a diagonal. But without knowing, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in deriving the equation. Let me re-express the AF = AB + BC + CD + DE + EF. 

AF = 8, AB = 6, BC = x, CD = y, DE = 2y -3, EF = x + 10/3. 

Adding them: 6 + x + y + (2y -3) + (x + 10/3) = 6 + x + y + 2y -3 + x + 10/3 = (6 -3) + (x + x) + (y + 2y) + 10/3 = 3 + 2x + 3y + 10/3. Converting 3 to thirds: 9/3 + 10/3 = 19/3. So total is 2x + 3y + 19/3 = 8. Thus, 2x + 3y = 8 - 19/3 = 24/3 - 19/3 = 5/3. Correct.

So 2x + 3y = 5/3. 

Now, if I assume that there's another equation from the DE = 2y -3. If DE is part of a different segment, like DE = something else. For example, if DE is equal to BC or something. But no info is given.

Wait, maybe the problem has a typo, and DE = 2y + 3 instead of minus? Or perhaps FE is related to DE. For example, if FE = DE + something. But without knowing, it's guesswork.

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that y is a function of x, like from another condition. For example, if DE = 2y -3 and FE = x + 10/3, and if there's a relationship between DE and FE, like DE = FE or DE + FE = something. 

Assume DE = FE: 2y -3 = x + 10/3 → 2y = x + 10/3 + 3 → 2y = x + 19/3 → y = x/2 + 19/6. Substituting into 2x + 3y = 5/3: 

2x + 3*(x/2 + 19/6) = 5/3  
2x + (3x/2 + 57/6) = 5/3  
Convert to common denominator:  
(4x/2 + 3x/2) + 57/6 = 5/3  
7x/2 + 57/6 = 5/3  
Multiply all terms by 6 to eliminate denominators:  
21x + 57 = 10  
21x = -47 → x = -47/21. Negative length, which is impossible. So invalid.

Alternative assumption: DE + FE = something. For example, DE + FE = AF? DE + FE = (2y -3) + (x + 10/3) = x + 2y -3 + 10/3 = x + 2y + 1/3. If this equals AF = 8, then x + 2y + 1/3 = 8 → x + 2y = 23/3. Now we have two equations: 
1. 2x + 3y = 5/3  
2. x + 2y = 23/3

Solving these:

From equation 2: x = 23/3 - 2y. Substitute into equation 1:

2*(23/3 - 2y) + 3y = 5/3  
46/3 - 4y + 3y = 5/3  
46/3 - y = 5/3  
-y = 5/3 - 46/3 = -41/3  
→ y = 41/3. 

Then x = 23/3 - 2*(41/3) = 23/3 - 82/3 = -59/3. Negative again. Not possible.

Another assumption: Maybe FE = DE + something. For example, FE = DE + BC. So x + 10/3 = (2y -3) + x → 10/3 = 2y -3 → 2y = 10/3 + 3 = 19/3 → y = 19/6. Substituting into 2x + 3y = 5/3: 2x + 3*(19/6) = 5/3 → 2x + 57/6 = 5/3 → convert 5/3 to 10/6: 2x = 10/6 - 57/6 = -47/6 → x = -47/12. Again negative.

This suggests that my assumptions about the arrangement are incorrect. Maybe the points are not all on a straight line. Let's try a different approach. Let's think about the possibility that the figure is composed of multiple triangles or other polygons, and apply the given lengths to derive relations.

Consider triangle AFE, with AF = 8, AB = 6, and FE = x + 10/3. If there's a relation between AB and FE, like AB is part of a median or altitude. But without more info, it's hard to say.

Wait, maybe there's a right triangle involving AB and FE. For example, if AB is perpendicular to FE, then by Pythagoras: AB^2 + FE^2 = AF^2? Let's check: 6^2 + (x + 10/3)^2 = 8^2 → 36 + (x + 10/3)^2 = 64 → (x + 10/3)^2 = 28 → x + 10/3 = sqrt(28) ≈ 5.2915 → x ≈ 5.2915 - 3.3333 ≈ 1.958. This is approximately 2, but none of the answer choices are close to this. So likely not the case.

Alternatively, if AB and FE are legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse AF: 6^2 + (x + 10/3)^2 = 8^2, which is what I did. Same result.

Alternatively, if AF is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs AB and BC: 6^2 + x^2 = 8^2 → x^2 = 64 - 36 = 28 → x = sqrt(28) ≈ 5.2915. Again, not matching answer choices.

Wait, the answer choices are 9, 10, 13.3, 15. None of these are close to 5.29. So this suggests that this approach is wrong.

Another idea: Maybe the problem involves a trapezoid with bases AB and FE, and legs BC and DE. But without knowing the height or other properties, it's hard to apply.

Wait, given the time I've spent without progress, maybe I should look for an alternative method. Let me think about the equation 2x + 3y = 5/3. If I assume that y is a fraction, and try to find x. Let's say y = 1. Then 2x + 3*1 = 5/3 → 2x = 5/3 - 3 = -4/3 → x = -2/3. No good. If y = 2/3: 2x + 3*(2/3) = 2x + 2 = 5/3 → 2x = 5/3 - 2 = -1/3 → x = -1/6. Still negative.

Wait, perhaps the equation is supposed to be 2x + 3y = 5/3, and there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe the original equation is different. For example, if AF is not the sum of all those segments, but instead, there's another relationship.

Wait, let's think outside the box. What if the points are arranged such that AF is split into AB and BF, and BF is split into BC, CD, DE, EF? So AF = AB + BF, and BF = BC + CD + DE + EF. So AF = AB + BC + CD + DE + EF. Which is the same as before. So again, 2x + 3y = 5/3.

But this leads to no solution. Maybe the problem has a typo and the equation should be 2x + 3y = 5/3, but with another condition. For example, if DE = 2y -3 is equal to some other segment, like BC. So 2y -3 = x. Then we have:

From DE = x: 2y -3 = x → x = 2y -3. Substitute into 2x + 3y = 5/3:

2*(2y -3) + 3y = 5/3  
4y -6 + 3y = 5/3  
7y = 5/3 + 6 = 5/3 + 18/3 = 23/3  
y = 23/(3*7) = 23/21.  
Then x = 2*(23/21) -3 = 46/21 - 63/21 = -17/21. Still negative.

No good. What if DE = FE? So 2y -3 = x + 10/3 → 2y = x + 10/3 +3 = x + 19/3 → y = x/2 + 19/6. Substitute into 2x + 3y = 5/3: 

2x + 3(x/2 + 19/6) = 5/3  
2x + 3x/2 + 57/6 = 5/3  
Convert to sixths: 12x/6 + 9x/6 + 57/6 = 10/6  
(21x + 57)/6 = 10/6  
21x + 57 = 10  
21x = -47  
x = -47/21. Still negative.

This suggests that under various assumptions, x is negative, which is impossible. This indicates that there's either a mistake in the problem, or my understanding of the configuration is incorrect. Given that the answer choices are positive, perhaps there's a different interpretation.

Wait, perhaps AF is not the sum of AB + BC + CD + DE + EF, but instead, it's a different combination. For example, if AF is AB + BF, and BF is BC + CD + DE, and FE is another segment. Let me try this:

AF = AB + BF = 6 + BF = 8 → BF = 2. 

BF is BC + CD + DE = x + y + (2y -3) = x + 3y -3 = 2 → x + 3y = 5. 

Also, FE = x + 10/3. If FE is another segment, like from F to E. If E is at the end of DE, then FE could be part of another segment. But without knowing how F and E are connected, it's hard to say. 

But now we have x + 3y = 5. And we need another equation. Maybe FE is related to something else. For example, if FE is equal to DE or something. Suppose FE = DE: x + 10/3 = 2y -3 → x = 2y -3 -10/3 = 2y - 19/3. Substitute into x + 3y = 5: 

(2y - 19/3) + 3y = 5 → 5y - 19/3 = 5 → 5y = 5 + 19/3 = 15/3 + 19/3 = 34/3 → y = 34/(3*5) = 34/15 ≈ 2.2667. Then x = 2*(34/15) - 19/3 = 68/15 - 95/15 = -27/15 = -9/5. Negative again.

Not working. What if FE = BC? Then x + 10/3 = x → 10/3 = 0, which is impossible.

Alternatively, FE = CD: x + 10/3 = y → substitute into x + 3y = 5: x + 3(x + 10/3) = 5 → x + 3x + 10 = 5 → 4x = -5 → x = -5/4. Still negative.

Another possibility: FE is part of another equation. For example, if there's a right triangle involving FE and DE. But without knowing angles, it's hard.

At this point, I'm running out of ideas. Given that the answer choices are all positive, and my equations keep yielding negative x, perhaps there's a miscalculation. Let me recheck the initial equation.

Original equation: AF = AB + BC + CD + DE + EF. With AF = 8, AB = 6, BC = x, CD = y, DE = 2y -3, EF = x + 10/3. 

Sum: 6 + x + y + (2y -3) + (x + 10/3) = 6 + x + y + 2y -3 + x + 10/3 = 6 -3 + 10/3 + x + x + y + 2y = 3 + 10/3 + 2x + 3y. 

3 is 9/3, so total is 9/3 + 10/3 = 19/3. So 19/3 + 2x + 3y = 8 → 2x + 3y = 8 - 19/3 = 24/3 - 19/3 = 5/3. Correct.

Now, if I assume that there's a mistake in the problem and the correct equation is 2x + 3y = 5, not 5/3. Let's say it's 2x + 3y = 5. Then, with another equation, say, from DE = 2y -3 and some other condition.

For example, if DE = 2y -3 is equal to FE - something. But without knowing, it's guesswork.

Alternatively, if there's a typo in the problem and DE = 2y + 3. Let's try that. Then DE = 2y + 3. Then the sum AF = 6 + x + y + (2y + 3) + (x + 10/3) = 6 + x + y + 2y + 3 + x + 10/3 = 6 + 3 + 10/3 + 2x + 3y = 9 + 10/3 + 2x + 3y = 37/3 + 2x + 3y = 8 → 2x + 3y = 8 - 37/3 = 24/3 - 37/3 = -13/3. Still negative.

No good. 

Perhaps the original equation should be 2x + 3y = 5. Let's say that. Then, if there's another equation from DE = 2y -3. For example, if DE = BC, then 2y -3 = x. So x = 2y -3. Substitute into 2x + 3y = 5: 2*(2y -3) + 3y = 4y -6 + 3y = 7y -6 = 5 → 7y = 11 → y = 11/7. Then x = 2*(11/7) -3 = 22/7 - 21/7 = 1/7. Positive! So x = 1/7. But this is not among the answer choices. However, if this is the case, then BC = x = 1/7, which is not an option. So this suggests that even with this assumption, it doesn't match.

Alternatively, if DE = FE: 2y -3 = x + 10/3 → x = 2y - 19/3. Substitute into 2x + 3y = 5: 2*(2y - 19/3) + 3y = 4y - 38/3 + 3y = 7y - 38/3 = 5 → 7y = 5 + 38/3 = 15/3 + 38/3 = 53/3 → y = 53/(3*7) = 53/21. Then x = 2*(53/21) - 19/3 = 106/21 - 133/21 = -27/21 = -9/7. Negative again.

This is frustrating. Given that I'm stuck, maybe I should look for another approach. Let me think about the answer choices. The choices are 9, 10, 13.3, 15. These are all positive. Let me assume that x is one of these and see if it satisfies the equation 2x + 3y = 5/3.

For example, if x = 9: 2*9 + 3y = 5/3 → 18 + 3y = 5/3 → 3y = 5/3 - 18 = 5/3 - 54/3 = -49/3 → y = -49/9. Negative.

x = 10: 2*10 + 3y = 5/3 → 20 + 3y = 5/3 → 3y = -55/3 → y = -55/9. No.

x = 13.3: 2*13.3 = 26.6, 26.6 + 3y = 5/3 ≈ 1.6667 → 3y = -24.9333 → y negative.

x = 15: 30 + 3y = 1.6667 → y negative.

None of these work. This suggests that the equation is incorrect, or the problem is misstated. 

Given that I cannot find a valid solution with the current information, and the answer choices suggest a positive x, I must conclude that there's either a missing piece of information or a misinterpretation of the problem. However, since the user provided this as a problem, I must have made an error in assumptions.

Wait, let me try one last thing. What if AF is not the sum of all those segments, but instead, it's a different combination. For example, AF is AB + BF, and BF is BC + CD + DE, and FE is another segment. Let's try this:

AF = AB + BF = 8. BF = BC + CD + DE = x + y + (2y -3) = x + 3y -3. So x + 3y -3 = 8 - 6 = 2 → x + 3y = 5. 

Now, FE is given as x + 10/3. If FE is related to another segment, like FE = DE + something. For example, if FE = DE + CD, then x + 10/3 = (2y -3) + y = 3y -3. So x + 10/3 = 3y -3 → x = 3y -3 -10/3 = 3y - 19/3. Substitute into x + 3y = 5: 

3y - 19/3 + 3y = 5 → 6y = 5 + 19/3 = 15/3 + 19/3 = 34/3 → y = 34/18 = 17/9. Then x = 3*(17/9) - 19/3 = 51/9 - 57/9 = -6/9 = -2/3. Still negative.

Alternatively, if FE = CD + DE: x + 10/3 = y + (2y -3) = 3y -3 → x = 3y -3 -10/3 = 3y - 19/3. Same as above.

No luck. 

Given that I'm unable to find a valid solution with the given information, and the answer choices suggest a positive x, I must conclude that there's either a mistake in the problem or a missing piece of information. However, since the user expects an answer, I'll have to make an educated guess. 

Looking back at the equation 2x + 3y = 5/3, and assuming that there's a typo and it should be 2x + 3y = 5, then with another equation, say, DE = 2y -3 = x. Solving:

From DE = x: 2y -3 = x → x = 2y -3. Substitute into 2x + 3y = 5: 2(2y -3) + 3y = 4y -6 + 3y = 7y -
