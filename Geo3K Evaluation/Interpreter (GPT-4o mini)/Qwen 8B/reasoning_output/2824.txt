Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have points A, B, C, R, S, T, M. There are several lines mentioned: Line(A,R), Line(R,M), Line(S,B), Line(M,S), Line(C,T), Line(T,M). Also, there are some median-related predicates: IsMedianOf(Line(R,M), Triangle(A,R,S)) and IsMedianOf(Line(S,R), Triangle(R,M,S)). Then there are length equalities: Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,R)), 7), Equals(LengthOf(Line(R,M)), 4), Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,T)), LengthOf(Line(T,B))), and congruences: Congruent(Line(A,R), Line(A,S)), Congruent(Line(B,S), Line(B,T)), Congruent(Line(C,R), Line(C,T)).

The question asks for MS, given MC=7, RM=4, and AT=16. Wait, but looking at the given equals, it says Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,R)), 7) so that would mean CR=7. And RM is given as 4. So maybe MC refers to MR? Or perhaps there's confusion here. Wait, the user wrote "M C = 7" which probably means MC=7. But according to the given, LengthOf(Line(C,R)) is 7, so CR=7. Hmm, maybe there's a typo, but I'll proceed with the given info.

Let me sketch the diagram mentally. Since there are medians involved, maybe we need to consider triangles where these medians lie. For example, the first predicate says Line(R,M) is a median of Triangle(A,R,S). That implies that R,M connects to the midpoint of AS? Wait, no. In a triangle, a median connects a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. So if Line(R,M) is a median of Triangle(A,R,S), then R must be one of the vertices, and M is the midpoint of the opposite side. Wait, Triangle(A,R,S) has vertices A, R, S. The sides are AR, RS, SA. So the median from R would go to the midpoint of AS. Therefore, if Line(R,M) is a median, then M must be the midpoint of AS. Similarly, the second predicate says Line(S,R) is a median of Triangle(R,M,S). So Triangle(R,M,S) has vertices R, M, S. The median from S would connect to the midpoint of RM. Wait, but Line(S,R) is a median. Wait, the median should connect a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. So if the median is Line(S,R), then S is connected to the midpoint of RM. Wait, but Line(S,R) goes from S to R. Wait, but if the median is from S to the midpoint of RM, then the midpoint of RM would be a point. However, in the given, there's a point M already. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure here.

Wait, the first median is Line(R,M) being a median of Triangle(A,R,S). So that suggests that R is a vertex of the triangle, and M is the midpoint of the opposite side. Which side? The opposite side to R in Triangle(A,R,S) is AS. So M is the midpoint of AS. Therefore, AM = MS. Because M is the midpoint of AS.

Then the second predicate: IsMedianOf(Line(S,R), Triangle(R,M,S)). So Triangle(R,M,S) has vertices R, M, S. The median from S would connect S to the midpoint of RM. But the line given is Line(S,R). Wait, unless there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the median is from R? Wait, the line is Line(S,R), which connects S to R. So if that's a median, then it must connect S to the midpoint of RM. But since the line is from S to R, that would imply that R is the midpoint of RM? That doesn't make sense unless R is the same as M, which isn't the case. So perhaps there's a misinterpretation here.

Alternatively, maybe the median is from R to the midpoint of MS. Wait, but the line is Line(S,R). Maybe I need to re-examine the definitions. 

Alternatively, maybe the second median is part of another triangle. Let me think again. The second predicate is IsMedianOf(Line(S,R), Triangle(R,M,S)). So in Triangle(R,M,S), the line S-R is a median. That would mean that the median starts at S and goes to the midpoint of the opposite side, which is RM. Therefore, the midpoint of RM is a point, say N. But in our case, the line is from S to R. Unless R is the midpoint of RM, which would require that R divides RM into two equal parts. But since RM is given as 4 units long (from Equals(LengthOf(Line(R,M)), 4)), if R were the midpoint of RM, then MR would be half of RM, but that would imply RM = 0, which isn't possible. So this seems contradictory. Therefore, my initial assumption about the first median might be wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the median is not from R, but from another vertex. Wait, in Triangle(R,M,S), the three vertices are R, M, S. The median could be from R to the midpoint of MS, from M to the midpoint of RS, or from S to the midpoint of RM. The given line is Line(S,R), which is connecting S to R. So for this to be a median, it must be that S is connected to the midpoint of RM. Therefore, Line(S,R) is the median from S to the midpoint of RM. Therefore, R is the midpoint of RM? No, because that would imply that R is the midpoint of RM, making MR = 0. This is confusing. Perhaps there's a miscalculation here.

Wait, maybe the line S-R is not directly the median but part of the median. Wait, but the predicate states that Line(S,R) is a median of Triangle(R,M,S). Therefore, that line must be a median. Hence, the line connects S to the midpoint of RM. Therefore, the midpoint of RM is a point, say N. But the line given is S-R. Therefore, R must be the midpoint of RM? Which again leads to contradiction. Therefore, perhaps there's a different interpretation.

Alternatively, maybe the line S-R is the median from S to the midpoint of RM. So the midpoint of RM is a point, say K. Therefore, the line SK is the median. But the given line is SR. Therefore, unless K coincides with R, which would require that R is the midpoint of RM, implying that MR = 0, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be something wrong with my understanding.

Perhaps the problem involves more than just the two triangles mentioned. Let me check all the predicates again. There's also Line(C,T), Line(T,M), and some congruencies involving C. Also, the congruence Congruent(Line(C,R), Line(C,T)) implies that CR = CT. Given that Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,R)), 7), so CT = 7 as well. Also, Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,T)), LengthOf(Line(T,B))) implies TB = CT = 7. So TB = 7.

Moreover, Congruent(Line(A,R), Line(A,S)) implies AR = AS. So triangle ARS is isoceles with AR = AS. Also, Congruent(Line(B,S), Line(B,T)) implies BS = BT. Since BT = 7 from earlier, BS = 7.

Now, going back to the medians. Let me try again. The first median: Line(R,M) is a median of Triangle(A,R,S). So in Triangle(A,R,S), the median from R would go to the midpoint of AS. So if Line(R,M) is that median, then M is the midpoint of AS. Therefore, AM = MS. So MS is half of AS. Also, since AR = AS (from congruence), then AS = AR. So if I can find AR, then MS would be half of that.

But how do I find AR? Let's see. We know that RM = 4. From the given, LengthOf(Line(R,M)) is 4. Since M is the midpoint of AS, and R is connected to M. So RM is a segment from R to M. How does that relate to the rest?

Additionally, there's Line(M,S) which is part of the second median. Let me look at the second predicate: IsMedianOf(Line(S,R), Triangle(R,M,S)). As before, this seems problematic. But maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the triangle. Let me consider Triangle(R,M,S). The line S-R is a median. So the median must connect S to the midpoint of RM. Therefore, the midpoint of RM is a point, say N. So Line(S,N) is the median. But the given line is Line(S,R). Therefore, unless N=R, which would imply that R is the midpoint of RM, leading to MR = 0. Not possible. So maybe there's a different way.

Wait, perhaps the line S-R is the median from R? Wait, no. The median is from S to the midpoint of RM. So if the line is from S to the midpoint of RM, which is N. But the given line is from S to R. Therefore, unless R is the midpoint of RM. Which again implies that R is the midpoint, so RM = 0. Contradiction. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the setup.

Alternative approach: Maybe the triangle in the second predicate is not Triangle(R,M,S) but another triangle. Wait, the second predicate is IsMedianOf(Line(S,R), Triangle(R,M,S)). So the triangle is R, M, S. So vertices R, M, S. The line S-R is part of the triangle, but the median must be from one of the vertices. The median from S would be to the midpoint of RM. So if the line is S-R, that would be a median only if R is the midpoint of RM, which is impossible. Therefore, there's inconsistency here. Maybe the line is not directly the median but part of it. Alternatively, perhaps the line is from R to the midpoint of SM. Wait, but the line given is S-R. So that would be the median from R to the midpoint of SM. Let me check that.

In Triangle(R,M,S), the median from R would go to the midpoint of MS. So if the line is from R to the midpoint of MS, which would be a new point, say P. But the given line is S-R. So unless P=S, which would mean that S is the midpoint of MS, implying that MS = 0, which is impossible. Therefore, this approach isn't working.

Hmm, maybe the problem involves more than just those two triangles. Let me try to visualize all the points and lines. Points A, B, C, R, S, T, M. Lines:

Line(A,R), Line(R,M), Line(S,B), Line(M,S), Line(C,T), Line(T,M).

Also, the medians: Line(R,M) is a median of Triangle(A,R,S); Line(S,R) is a median of Triangle(R,M,S). 

Maybe I should focus on the congruences and lengths first. From the congruences:

AR = AS, BS = BT, CR = CT. Also, CR = 7, so CT = 7, and TB = 7 (since CT = TB). Also, RM = 4.

Given that MC = 7? Wait, the question says M C = 7. Wait, in the problem statement, the question is "M C = 7, R M = 4, and A T = 16. Find M S." So MC = 7, RM = 4, AT = 16. Wait, but earlier we had CR = 7 (from Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,R)), 7)), so CR = 7. So MC may refer to CR? Or is there a mix-up in notation? Assuming MC is the distance between M and C, which is given as 7. So MC = 7.

So now, I have MC = 7, RM = 4, and AT = 16. Need to find MS.

Let me try to find relations between these segments. 

From earlier, since Line(R,M) is a median of Triangle(A,R,S), then M is the midpoint of AS. Therefore, AM = MS. So if I can find AS, then MS is half of that.

But how to find AS? Well, since AR = AS (from congruence), so AS = AR. So if I can find AR, then MS = AR / 2.

To find AR, maybe use other information. Let's see. Also, there's Line(C,T) and Line(T,M). Since CR = CT = 7, and TB = 7 (from CT = TB). So T is a point such that CT = TB = 7. So T lies somewhere such that it's equidistant from C and B, forming an isoceles triangle with base CB. But without knowing coordinates, it's hard to tell.

Also, AT = 16. So the distance from A to T is 16. Maybe we can use coordinate geometry here. Assign coordinates to the points and set up equations.

Let me attempt to assign coordinates. Let's choose coordinates such that certain points are easy to handle.

First, since we have medians and midpoints, maybe placing points strategically. Let me assume coordinates for some points.

Let me place point R at origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, since RM = 4, and M is a point such that Line(R,M) is a median. Earlier, we thought that M is the midpoint of AS. But I'm not sure yet. Let me proceed.

Assume R is at (0,0). Let me denote M as (x,y), but since RM = 4, the distance from R(0,0) to M(x,y) is √(x² + y²) = 4. Let's keep that in mind.

Since Line(R,M) is a median of Triangle(A,R,S), then M is the midpoint of AS. So if I can express coordinates of A and S such that M is their midpoint. Let's suppose A is at (a,b) and S is at (c,d). Then M would be ((a+c)/2, (b+d)/2). But since M is (x,y), then x = (a+c)/2 and y = (b+d)/2. So c = 2x - a, d = 2y - b.

Additionally, we have Congruent(Line(A,R), Line(A,S)) → AR = AS. The distance from A to R is √((a-0)^2 + (b-0)^2) = √(a² + b²). Distance from A to S is √((a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2). Substituting c and d:

√[(a - (2x - a))^2 + (b - (2y - b))^2] = √[(2a - 2x)^2 + (2b - 2y)^2] = √[4(a - x)^2 + 4(b - y)^2] = 2√[(a - x)^2 + (b - y)^2]. 

Setting this equal to AR: √(a² + b²) = 2√[(a - x)^2 + (b - y)^2]. Squaring both sides: a² + b² = 4[(a - x)^2 + (b - y)^2].

This gives us an equation relating a, b, x, y. But without more information, this might not be helpful yet.

Now, considering the other congruence: Congruent(Line(B,S), Line(B,T)) → BS = BT. Also, CT = TB = 7. So from earlier, CT = 7 and TB = 7. So point T is such that it's 7 units away from C and 7 units from B. So T lies on the perpendicular bisector of CB.

Also, Line(C,T) and Line(T,M) are present. So T is connected to C and to M. Additionally, we have AT = 16.

This seems complicated, but maybe we can find coordinates for some points. Let me try to assign coordinates step by step.

Let me fix R at (0,0) as before. Let me assume that M is at (4,0), so that RM = 4 (distance from R(0,0) to M(4,0) is 4). This simplifies calculations. Now, since M is the midpoint of AS (as per the first median), then A and S are symmetric with respect to M. So if M is at (4,0), then A and S are points such that their midpoint is (4,0). Let me denote A as (4 - p, q) and S as (4 + p, -q) for some p and q. This ensures that their midpoint is ((4-p + 4+p)/2, (q + (-q))/2) = (4, 0), which is M.

Now, since AR = AS (from congruence), compute distances:

AR: distance from A(4-p, q) to R(0,0): √[(4-p)^2 + q^2]

AS: distance from A(4-p,q) to S(4+p,-q): √[( (4+p) - (4-p) )^2 + (-q - q)^2 ] = √[(2p)^2 + (-2q)^2] = √(4p² + 4q²) = 2√(p² + q²)

Set AR = AS:

√[(4-p)^2 + q^2] = 2√(p² + q²)

Square both sides:

(4-p)^2 + q^2 = 4(p² + q²)

Expand left side: 16 -8p + p² + q² = 4p² + 4q²

Bring all terms to left:

16 -8p + p² + q² -4p² -4q² = 0 → 16 -8p -3p² -3q² = 0 → 3p² + 3q² +8p -16 = 0 → divide by 3: p² + q² + (8/3)p - 16/3 = 0. Not sure if helpful yet.

But maybe I can find another relation. Let me consider the other median. The second predicate: IsMedianOf(Line(S,R), Triangle(R,M,S)). With R at (0,0), M at (4,0), and S at (4+p, -q). So Triangle(R,M,S) has vertices at R(0,0), M(4,0), S(4+p, -q). The line S-R is from S(4+p, -q) to R(0,0). According to the predicate, this line is a median of the triangle. So this line must be a median, meaning it connects S to the midpoint of the opposite side. The opposite side to S in Triangle(R,M,S) is RM. So the midpoint of RM is ( (0+4)/2, (0+0)/2 ) = (2, 0). Therefore, the median from S should connect S to (2,0). But the given line is S-R, which connects S to R(0,0). So unless R is the midpoint of RM, which would mean that R is the midpoint between R and M, which is not possible unless M=R, which contradicts RM=4. Therefore, there's a contradiction here, indicating that my assumption about M being the midpoint of AS might be incorrect.

Wait, this suggests that my earlier conclusion that M is the midpoint of AS is wrong. Maybe the median is from R to the midpoint of AS, but in that case, the line would be from R to the midpoint of AS. But the given line is Line(R,M). So if that line is the median, then M is the midpoint of AS. But then why does the second median lead to contradictions? Perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that M is the midpoint of AS. Let me reconsider.

Alternatively, perhaps the median is not from R, but from another vertex. Wait, in Triangle(A,R,S), the median from R would go to the midpoint of AS. So if Line(R,M) is that median, then yes, M is the midpoint of AS. But then in Triangle(R,M,S), the line S-R is supposed to be a median. Which would mean that it connects S to the midpoint of RM. But RM is from R(0,0) to M(midpoint of AS). If M is the midpoint of AS, then its coordinates depend on A and S. Let me try again with M as midpoint of AS.

Let me take M as midpoint of AS. Suppose A is (a_x, a_y) and S is (s_x, s_y). Then M is ((a_x+s_x)/2, (a_y + s_y)/2). Now, the line RM connects R(0,0) to M. And this is a median of Triangle(A,R,S). So far, okay.

Now, the second predicate: IsMedianOf(Line(S,R), Triangle(R,M,S)). So in Triangle(R,M,S), the line S-R is a median. Which means that it connects S to the midpoint of RM. The midpoint of RM is [(0 + M_x)/2, (0 + M_y)/2] = (M_x/2, M_y/2). So the median from S should connect S to (M_x/2, M_y/2). But the given line is S-R, which connects S to R(0,0). Therefore, unless R is the midpoint of RM, which would require that M is such that R is halfway between R and M. Which would mean that M is symmetric to R around R, i.e., M = 2R - R = R, which is impossible. Thus, this suggests that my assumption that M is the midpoint of AS is incorrect, or there's an error in the problem setup.

This contradiction indicates that my initial assumption about the median might be wrong. Let me revisit the definition of the median. In a triangle, a median connects a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. So for Line(R,M) to be a median of Triangle(A,R,S), it must connect R to the midpoint of the opposite side, which is AS. Therefore, M is the midpoint of AS. But then, in the second predicate, Line(S,R) being a median of Triangle(R,M,S) requires that it connects S to the midpoint of RM. But since RM is a segment from R to M, its midpoint is a new point, say N. So Line(S,N) would be the median. However, the given line is S-R, which is not the same as S-N unless N=R, which isn't possible. Therefore, there must be something wrong here. 

Perhaps there's a different configuration where M is not the midpoint of AS, but another point. Alternatively, maybe the median is from M to the midpoint of RS? But the line given is Line(R,M), which is from R to M. So that would imply that M is the midpoint of RS? But then, since M is the midpoint of RS, and R is a vertex, then S would be mirrored over M. But then, how does this fit with the first median?

Alternatively, maybe the triangle is different. Let me check the first predicate again: IsMedianOf(Line(R,M), Triangle(A,R,S)). So the median is from R to M, which is a median of Triangle(A,R,S). Therefore, the median connects R to the midpoint of AS, so M is the midpoint of AS. So that part is fixed. 

Now, for the second predicate: IsMedianOf(Line(S,R), Triangle(R,M,S)). So in Triangle(R,M,S), the median is Line(S,R), which connects S to R. This implies that R is the midpoint of the opposite side, which is MS. Wait! Because in Triangle(R,M,S), the median from S would go to the midpoint of RM, but the median from R would go to the midpoint of MS. Wait, if the line is Line(S,R), then it's the median from S to the midpoint of RM. Or from R to the midpoint of MS. Wait, no. The median from S would go to the midpoint of RM. The median from R would go to the midpoint of MS. The median from M would go to the midpoint of RS.

So if Line(S,R) is a median, it must be either:

- The median from S to midpoint of RM, or
- The median from R to midpoint of MS, or
- The median from M to midpoint of RS.

But the line is Line(S,R), which connects S to R. So if this is a median, then it must be one of these cases. 

Case 1: It's the median from S to midpoint of RM. So the midpoint of RM is a point N, and the line SN is the median. But the given line is SR, so unless N=R, which would mean R is the midpoint of RM. This implies that R is the midpoint of RM, so M is such that RM = 0, which is impossible.

Case 2: It's the median from R to midpoint of MS. So the median from R to midpoint of MS. Let's call the midpoint of MS as P. Then the line RP would be the median. But the given line is SR, so unless P=S, which would mean S is the midpoint of MS, implying that MS = 0, which is impossible.

Case 3: It's the median from M to midpoint of RS. So the line from M to midpoint of RS. But the given line is SR, which is from S to R. So this doesn't match.

Therefore, none of these cases seem to fit unless there's a different interpretation. This suggests that there's either a mistake in the problem, or my understanding is flawed.

Let me try a different approach. Maybe the line Line(S,R) is not a single median but part of multiple medians? Or perhaps the triangle is different. Let me look back at the predicates. The second predicate is IsMedianOf(Line(S,R), Triangle(R,M,S)). So the line is Line(S,R), and it is a median of Triangle(R,M,S). This implies that Line(S,R) is a median of that triangle. So in Triangle(R,M,S), one of the medians is the line from S to R. But in a triangle, a median connects a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. So if Line(S,R) is a median, then it must connect S to the midpoint of the opposite side, which is RM. So the midpoint of RM is a point, say Q. So the median from S to Q. But the line given is S-R, which implies that Q=R. So R is the midpoint of RM. Which means that RM = 0, which is impossible. Hence, this suggests that there's an inconsistency, possibly due to a misread of the predicates.

Wait, perhaps the line Line(S,R) is not from S to R, but from S to R through another point? No, the line is defined as Line(S,R), which is the straight line connecting S and R. So this brings me back to the previous contradiction.

At this point, I'm stuck with the contradiction arising from the second median. Perhaps I need to re-express the problem using vectors or coordinate geometry, even though it's getting complex.

Let me try assigning coordinates again, but this time with more variables.

Let me place point R at (0,0), as before. Let me assume M is at (4,0), since RM = 4. So M is at (4,0). Now, since Line(R,M) is a median of Triangle(A,R,S), M is the midpoint of AS. So A and S are points such that their midpoint is M(4,0). Let me denote A as (4 + a, b) and S as (4 - a, -b). This way, their midpoint is ((4+a + 4-a)/2, (b - b)/2) = (4, 0), which is M.

Now, we have congruence AR = AS. Let's calculate these distances. 

Point A is (4+a, b), R is (0,0). Distance AR = sqrt[(4+a)^2 + b^2]. 

Point S is (4 - a, -b), distance AS is sqrt[(4+a - (4 - a))^2 + (b - (-b))^2] = sqrt[(2a)^2 + (2b)^2] = 2*sqrt(a² + b²). 

Setting AR = AS: sqrt[(4+a)^2 + b^2] = 2*sqrt(a² + b²). Square both sides: (4+a)^2 + b^2 = 4(a² + b²). Expand: 16 + 8a + a² + b² = 4a² + 4b² → 16 + 8a + a² + b² - 4a² - 4b² = 0 → -3a² -3b² + 8a + 16 = 0 → 3a² + 3b² = 8a + 16. Let's note this as Equation (1).

Now, moving to the second median: IsMedianOf(Line(S,R), Triangle(R,M,S)). So in Triangle(R,M,S), which has points R(0,0), M(4,0), and S(4-a, -b). The line Line(S,R) connects S(4-a, -b) to R(0,0). This line is claimed to be a median of the triangle. So this line must connect S to the midpoint of the opposite side. The opposite side to S in Triangle(R,M,S) is RM. The midpoint of RM is ((0+4)/2, (0+0)/2) = (2, 0). Therefore, the median from S should connect S to (2,0). But the given line is S-R, which connects S to R(0,0). So unless (2,0) is the same as R, which it isn't, this doesn't hold. Hence, there's a contradiction. 

Unless there's a mistake in identifying the opposite side. Wait, in Triangle(R,M,S), the opposite side to S is RM, yes. So the median from S should connect to midpoint of RM, which is (2,0). So the median from S to (2,0) is the line from S(4-a, -b) to (2,0). But the given line is from S to R(0,0). So unless (2,0) is R, which it isn't. Therefore, this suggests that either there's an error in the problem, or my assumptions are wrong.

Wait, but the problem includes Line(M,S) as a predicate. So there's a line from M(4,0) to S(4-a, -b). Let me check if this line has any significance. 

Also, there are other points: C, T. Let's recall that Congruent(Line(C,R), Line(C,T)) implies CR = CT = 7. Also, Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,T)), LengthOf(Line(T,B))) → CT = TB = 7. So T is a point such that it's 7 units from C and 7 units from B. Also, AT = 16. 

But I don't have information about B or C yet. Let me try to incorporate this. 

Let me assume some coordinates for C and B. But this might get too complex. Let me think of other relations.

Since CR = 7, and CT = 7, and TB = 7. So T is a point such that it's 7 units from C and 7 units from B. So T lies on the intersection of two circles: one centered at C with radius 7, and one centered at B with radius 7. But without knowing B or C's coordinates, it's difficult.

However, we also have Line(C,T) and Line(T,M). So T is connected to C and M. Also, AT = 16. 

Let me try to find relations between these. If I can express coordinates for T, perhaps in terms of other points.

But this seems too vague. Let me return to the earlier contradiction regarding the second median. Perhaps the issue is that the line Line(S,R) is not the median itself but part of a larger structure? Or maybe there's a miscalculation in the midpoint?

Wait, in Triangle(R,M,S), if Line(S,R) is a median, it must be that it connects S to the midpoint of RM. But the midpoint of RM is (2,0). So the median from S to (2,0) is a line from S(4-a, -b) to (2,0). Let me calculate the slope of this line. The slope would be [0 - (-b)] / [2 - (4 - a)] = b / (a - 2). 

On the other hand, the line from S to R is from S(4-a, -b) to R(0,0), which has slope [0 - (-b)] / [0 - (4 - a)] = b / (a - 4). 

For these two lines to be the same, their slopes must be equal. So:

b/(a - 2) = b/(a - 4)

Assuming b ≠ 0, we can cancel b:

1/(a - 2) = 1/(a - 4) → a - 2 = a - 4 → -2 = -4, which is false. 

Thus, the only possibility is that b = 0, but then the slope would be undefined (division by zero), which would mean the lines are vertical. Let's check if b = 0.

If b = 0, then from Equation (1):

3a² + 0 = 8a + 16 → 3a² -8a -16 = 0. Solving this quadratic: a = [8 ± √(64 + 192)] / 6 = [8 ± √256]/6 = [8 ± 16]/6. So a = (24)/6 = 4 or a = (-8)/6 = -4/3. 

If a = 4, then point A is (4+4, 0) = (8, 0), and S is (4-4, 0) = (0, 0). But then S would be at (0,0), which is R. But R is already at (0,0), so S would coincide with R, which is likely invalid. 

If a = -4/3, then A is (4 - 4/3, 0) = (8/3, 0), and S is (4 - (-4/3), 0) = (4 + 4/3, 0) = (16/3, 0). So S is at (16/3, 0). 

With b = 0, the line from S to R is from (16/3, 0) to (0,0), which is along the x-axis. The midpoint of RM is (2,0). So the median from S to (2,0) is the line from (16/3, 0) to (2,0). This is a horizontal line, and the line from S to R is also horizontal. But these are different lines unless (2,0) is on the line SR. Let's check if (2,0) is on SR. 

SR is from (16/3, 0) to (0,0). The point (2,0) lies on this line since it's between 0 and 16/3 (which is approximately 5.333). So yes, (2,0) is on SR. Therefore, the line from S to R passes through the midpoint of RM, which is (2,0). Therefore, Line(S,R) is not just a median but contains the median from S to (2,0). But the predicate says that Line(S,R) is a median of Triangle(R,M,S). This implies that Line(S,R) is the entire median, not just a part of it. However, in this case, the line SR passes through the midpoint of RM, making it a median. But technically, the median is from S to (2,0), while the line SR extends beyond to R. So the line SR contains the median, but is it considered the median? This depends on the precise definition. If the median is defined as the segment from the vertex to the midpoint, then Line(S,R) would not be the median, but the line containing the median. However, if the predicate allows the line to contain the median, then it could be considered. 

Assuming this is acceptable, then with b=0 and a=-4/3, we can proceed. 

Now, with a = -4/3 and b=0, we have:

Point A is (8/3, 0), S is (16/3, 0), M is (4, 0). 

Now, let's verify the congruence AR = AS. 

Distance AR: from A(8/3, 0) to R(0,0): |8/3 - 0| = 8/3. 
Distance AS: from A(8/3, 0) to S(16/3, 0): |16/3 - 8/3| = 8/3. So yes, AR = AS. Good.

Now, with this setup, let's check other conditions. 

Next, we have Line(C,T) and Line(T,M). Also, CR = CT = 7, TB = 7, and AT = 16.

Let me try to find coordinates for C and T. 

Let me assume point C is somewhere, and T is such that CT = 7 and TB = 7. Also, Line(C,T) and Line(T,M) are present. Also, AT = 16. 

Let me denote T as a point such that it is 7 units from C and 7 units from B. But I need to find coordinates for B and C. 

But I don't have information about B yet. Let me see if I can relate other points. 

We also have Line(S,B). From the given, Line(S,B) exists. Point S is at (16/3, 0). Let me assume B is some point, and Line(S,B) is defined. Also, Congruent(Line(B,S), Line(B,T)) → BS = BT = 7. 

So from this, B is a point such that BS = BT = 7. So T lies on the intersection of circles centered at B with radius 7. Also, CT = 7. So T is at intersection of circles centered at C and B with radius 7. 

But without knowing C or B, this is challenging. Let me try to find coordinates for B and C. 

Let me assume that B is at some point, say (x, y), and T is a point such that BT = 7 and CT = 7. Also, AT = 16. 

Let me consider point A at (8/3, 0). AT is the distance from A to T, which is 16. So if I can express T in terms of other points, maybe I can find relations.

But this seems too open-ended. Let me try to find T. 

Since CT = 7 and TB = 7, T is on the perpendicular bisector of CB. Let me assume C is at some point (p, q), and B is at (r, s). Then T lies on the perpendicular bisector of CB. But without knowing C and B, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to use the fact that M is at (4,0) and T is connected to M via Line(T,M). 

Let me consider Line(T,M). Since T is connected to M, and we know M is at (4,0), and CT = 7, and TB = 7. 

Let me assume T has coordinates (t_x, t_y). Then:

CT = 7: distance from C to T is 7.

TB = 7: distance from T to B is 7.

Also, AT = 16: distance from A(8/3, 0) to T(t_x, t_y) is 16.

But without knowing C and B, this is still underdetermined. 

Wait, but there's also Line(C,T) and Line(T,M). So T is connected to C and M. Let me assume that Line(C,T) and Line(T,M) form a straight line? Not necessarily, but perhaps there's a relationship.

Alternatively, since CT = 7 and CM is given as 7 (MC = 7)? Wait, the question says MC = 7. Wait, earlier I assumed MC was referring to CR, but the question says MC = 7. So MC is the distance from M to C, which is 7. 

Ah! Here's a clue: MC = 7. So the distance from M(4,0) to C is 7. Let me write that down: distance from M(4,0) to C is 7. So if C has coordinates (p, q), then (p-4)^2 + (q-0)^2 = 49 → (p-4)^2 + q^2 = 49.

Also, CT = 7, so distance from C to T is 7. So (t_x - p)^2 + (t_y - q)^2 = 49.

And TB = 7: distance from T to B is 7. 

Also, AT = 16: distance from A(8/3, 0) to T(t_x, t_y) is 16: (t_x - 8/3)^2 + (t_y - 0)^2 = 256.

But this system has too many variables (p, q, t_x, t_y, r, s for B) and not enough equations. 

However, since we have Line(C,T) and Line(T,M), perhaps T lies on the line CM? Let me check. If T is on CM, then it would satisfy both CT and TM. But CM is from C to M(4,0). Let me assume T is on CM extended. Let me parametrize CM. 

Let me denote C as (4 + 7cosθ, 0 + 7sinθ) since the distance from M(4,0) to C is 7. So C is anywhere on the circle centered at M with radius 7. Let me pick θ for simplicity. Let me choose θ = 0 for simplicity, so C is at (4 + 7, 0) = (11, 0). Then T is a point on the line CM, which is the x-axis from M(4,0) to C(11,0). 

If T is on CM, then it lies on the x-axis. Let me assume T is between C and M or extended. Since CT = 7, and CM = 7, then T could be at C plus 7 units from C towards M. But since CM is 7 units, T would be at M. But then MT = 0, and CT = 7. But then T would be at M, which is (4,0). But then TB = 7 would mean the distance from T=M to B is 7, so B lies on a circle of radius 7 around M. Also, AT = 16: distance from A(8/3, 0) to T(4,0) is |4 - 8/3| = 4/3, which is not 16. So this doesn't work. 

Alternatively, T could be on the extension of CM beyond M. Let me say T is such that CT = 7. Since CM = 7, then T would be such that from C, moving 7 units towards M and beyond. Let me calculate. 

Let me parameterize T on line CM. Let me define vector from C to M: M - C = (4 - 11, 0 - 0) = (-7, 0). To move 7 units from C in the direction of M, we add 7*(unit vector from C to M). The unit vector is (-7,0)/7 = (-1,0). So T = C + 7*(-1,0) = (11 - 7, 0) = (4,0), which is M. Again, same issue.

Alternatively, if T is on the extension beyond C, then from C, moving 7 units away from M. So direction from C to M is (-7,0), so opposite direction is (7,0). So T = C + 7*(1,0) = (11 + 7, 0) = (18, 0). Then CT = 7, and TM = distance from T(18,0) to M(4,0) is 14. 

Now, TB = 7, so B is a point such that distance from T(18,0) to B is 7. Let me assume B is at (18 + 7, 0) = (25, 0) or (18 - 7, 0) = (11, 0). But B cannot be at (11,0) because that's point C. Let's say B is at (25,0). Then, Line(S,B) is from S(16/3, 0) to B(25,0). This is a horizontal line. Also, Line(B,S) has length SB = 25 - 16/3 = (75 - 16)/3 = 59
