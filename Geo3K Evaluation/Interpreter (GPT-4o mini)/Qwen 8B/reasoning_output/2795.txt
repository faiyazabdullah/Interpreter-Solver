MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's given and what's being asked. 

So, we have a quadrilateral WXYZ. The angles at each vertex are given in terms of a variable 'a'. Specifically:

- Angle W measures 0.5a + 8 degrees.
- Angle X measures a degrees.
- Angle Y measures a - 28 degrees.
- Angle Z measures a + 2 degrees.

The question is asking for the measure of angle Z, which is expressed as a + 2. So, essentially, I need to find the value of 'a' first, and then add 2 to it to get the measure of angle Z.

Since it's a quadrilateral, I remember that the sum of the interior angles in any quadrilateral is always 360 degrees. That seems like the key here. Let me confirm that. Yes, for any four-sided polygon, the sum of the interior angles is (n-2)*180, where n=4, so 2*180 = 360 degrees. Got that.

So, if I add up all four angles and set them equal to 360, I should be able to solve for 'a'. Let me write that equation out:

Angle W + Angle X + Angle Y + Angle Z = 360°

Substituting the expressions given:

(0.5a + 8) + a + (a - 28) + (a + 2) = 360

Now, let me simplify this equation step by step. First, combine like terms. Let's handle the coefficients of 'a' and the constants separately.

Starting with the 'a' terms:

0.5a comes from Angle W.

Then, there's a single 'a' from Angle X.

Another 'a' from Angle Y.

And another 'a' from Angle Z. Wait, wait—no. Wait, Angle Y is (a - 28), so that's a term with 'a', and Angle Z is (a + 2), also a term with 'a'. So total 'a' terms are 0.5a + a + a + a. Let me compute that:

0.5a + a is 1.5a, plus another a is 2.5a, plus another a is 3.5a. Wait, hold on:

Wait, original terms:

Angle W has 0.5a.

Angle X has a.

Angle Y has a.

Angle Z has a.

Wait, no. Let me check again:

Original expression:

(0.5a + 8) + a + (a - 28) + (a + 2)

Breaking down each part:

From Angle W: 0.5a + 8

From Angle X: +a

From Angle Y: +a - 28

From Angle Z: +a + 2

So combining all the 'a' terms:

0.5a (from W) + a (from X) + a (from Y) + a (from Z). Wait, but Angle Y is (a - 28), so the coefficient of 'a' there is 1, same with Angle Z, which is (a + 2), so coefficient is 1. So adding those up:

0.5a + a + a + a = 0.5a + 3a = 3.5a? Wait, 0.5a + a is 1.5a, then adding another a gives 2.5a, then another a gives 3.5a. Yes.

Now the constant terms:

+8 (from W) -28 (from Y) +2 (from Z). Let me calculate that:

8 - 28 is -20, then +2 is -18.

So putting it all together:

3.5a - 18 = 360.

So, solving for 'a':

3.5a = 360 + 18 → 3.5a = 378.

Therefore, a = 378 / 3.5.

Let me compute that division. Hmm, 3.5 goes into 378 how many times?

Well, 3.5 multiplied by 100 is 350. So 350 is 100 times. Then 378 - 350 = 28. So 28 divided by 3.5 is 8. Therefore, total a is 100 + 8 = 108.

So a equals 108 degrees.

Therefore, the measure of angle Z is a + 2, so substituting a = 108:

Z = 108 + 2 = 110 degrees.

Looking at the answer choices, option C is 110. So the answer should be C.

But let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, verifying the angle sum equation:

Original angles:

W: 0.5a +8

X: a

Y: a -28

Z: a +2

Sum: 0.5a +8 +a +a -28 +a +2

Combine a terms:

0.5a + a + a +a = 0.5a + 3a = 3.5a.

Constants: 8 -28 +2 = (8 +2) -28 = 10 -28 = -18. Correct.

Total equation: 3.5a -18 = 360 → 3.5a = 378 → a = 378 / 3.5.

Calculating 378 ÷ 3.5:

Multiply numerator and denominator by 2 to eliminate decimal: 378*2 = 756; 3.5*2 =7.

So 756 ÷7 = 108. Correct. So a=108.

Thus, angle Z is 108 +2 = 110. Which is option C.

Yes, that seems correct. No mistakes detected here. All steps follow logically. The key was recognizing that the sum of the angles in a quadrilateral is 360 degrees, setting up the equation correctly, and solving for 'a'. Then plugging back in to find angle Z. The answer is 110, so choice C.
