====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and see how they relate to each other. The question mentions angles 1, 2, 3, and asks for angle 5. But wait, the problem didn't specify which angles correspond to which numbers. Hmm, maybe the labels are implied by the predicates?

Looking at the predicates, there are several angles listed: Angle(A,E,C), Angle(A,B,C), Angle(B,E,C), Angle(B,C,D), Angle(E,D,C). Also, there are triangles mentioned like Triangle(A,B,C), Triangle(B,D,E), Triangle(E,C,D). Let me try to visualize the figure based on these points and lines.

Points A, B, C, D, E are connected in lines. Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Line(D,E), Line(E,A), and also Line(A,E) and Line(B,D). So connecting those points forms some polygons. For example, A-B-C-D-E-A would form a pentagon? Wait, but there's also Line(A,E) which connects back to A, so maybe it's a pentagon with diagonals. Also, Line(B,D) adds another diagonal.

Now, the angles given are m∠1=58°, m∠2=47°, m∠3=26°, and we need ∠5. Since the problem refers to angles 1,2,3,5, perhaps these are labeled in the diagram based on the given angles in the predicates. Let me check which angles are present in the predicates.

The angles listed are:

1. Angle(A,E,C): This is angle at point E between points A and C. So ∠AEC.
2. Angle(A,B,C): Angle at B between A and C, so ∠ABC.
3. Angle(B,E,C): Angle at E between B and C, so ∠BEC.
4. Angle(B,C,D): Angle at C between B and D, so ∠BCD.
5. Angle(E,D,C): Angle at D between E and C, so ∠EDC.

Wait, but the question mentions angles 1, 2, 3, and 5. Maybe angle 1 corresponds to one of these. Let me assume that angle 1 is ∠AEC (since that's the first angle listed), angle 2 could be ∠ABC, angle 3 as ∠BEC, and angle 5 could be something else. Alternatively, maybe different labeling. But without seeing the actual diagram, this is tricky. However, since the answer options are numerical, maybe we can use the given angle measures to find relations.

Alternatively, perhaps angle 1, 2, 3 refer to angles within certain triangles. Let me think about the triangles mentioned in the predicates. There's Triangle(A,B,C), Triangle(B,D,E), Triangle(E,C,D).

Let me consider Triangle(A,B,C). In this triangle, the angles would be ∠A, ∠B, and ∠C. From the given angles, ∠A,B,C is angle at B, which is ∠ABC. Then if we have angles in this triangle, maybe other angles are involved. Similarly, Triangle(B,D,E) has angles at B, D, E. And Triangle(E,C,D) has angles at E, C, D.

But the problem gives three angles: 1, 2, 3, and asks for angle 5. Let me try to map them.

Suppose angle 1 is ∠AEC (from Angle(A,E,C)), which is part of triangle AEC. But maybe that's not directly helpful. Alternatively, angle 1 could be part of triangle BEC or others.

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is ∠BEC (which is Angle(B,E,C)) because that's one of the given angles. Let me suppose:

Given m∠1 = 58°, m∠2 = 47°, m∠3 = 26°, find m∠5.

Assuming that ∠1 is ∠BEC (Angle(B,E,C)), ∠2 is ∠ABC (Angle(A,B,C)), and ∠3 is ∠EDC (Angle(E,D,C)). Then angle 5 could be another angle in the figure.

Alternatively, perhaps angle 5 is part of triangle BCD or something else.

Let me try to reconstruct the figure. Points A, B, C, D, E connected as per lines. So lines AB, BC, CD, DE, EA, AE, BD. That suggests that the figure is a pentagon with diagonals BD and AE.

So, for example, points A connected to B, B to C, C to D, D to E, E to A, and also A to E (so forming a pentagon?), plus BD connecting B to D.

This seems like a pentagon with two diagonals. Now, considering the triangles mentioned: Triangle(A,B,C) is triangle ABC, Triangle(B,D,E) is triangle BDE, and Triangle(E,C,D) is triangle EDC.

Let me focus on the angles given. Suppose angle 1 is ∠BEC (Angle(B,E,C)) = 58°, angle 2 is ∠ABC (Angle(A,B,C)) = 47°, angle 3 is ∠EDC (Angle(E,D,C)) = 26°. Then angle 5 might be another angle in the figure, say ∠EAB or something else.

Alternatively, maybe angle 5 is part of triangle BDE or EDC.

Alternatively, let's look for cyclic quadrilaterals or triangle sums. For instance, in triangle ABC, the sum of angles is 180°. Given ∠ABC = 47°, if we can find other angles here.

Wait, but we don't know if ABC is a triangle. Wait, the predicate says Triangle(A,B,C), so yes, ABC is a triangle. Therefore, in triangle ABC, angles are ∠A, ∠B, ∠C. We know ∠B is 47°, so if we can find other angles here.

But where do angles 1, 2, 3 come into play? Let me think again.

If angle 1 is ∠AEC (Angle(A,E,C)), which is outside triangle ABC. Or maybe it's part of triangle AEC.

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is ∠AEB or something else. Without knowing the exact diagram, this is challenging. Perhaps I should look for relationships between the given angles and the triangles.

Another approach: since there are several triangles given, maybe applying triangle angle sum or exterior angle theorem.

For example, consider triangle BEC (if that exists). If angle at E (∠BEC) is 58°, and if we can find other angles here.

Alternatively, looking at triangle EDC: angle at D (∠EDC) is 26°, as given. If we can find other angles in that triangle.

Also, there's triangle BDE. Let me check its angles. Points B, D, E. So angles at B, D, E.

Alternatively, maybe using vertical angles or supplementary angles.

Wait, let's consider that in triangle ABC, angle at B is 47°, so if we can find other angles here. But without more info, this may not help yet.

Alternatively, since there are lines connecting A to E and B to D, perhaps creating intersecting lines. For example, lines AE and BD intersect at some point? Or maybe forming other triangles.

Wait, the lines given include AE and BD. So line AE connects A to E, and BD connects B to D. These lines might intersect at some point inside the figure. If that's the case, perhaps forming vertical angles or transversal angles.

Alternatively, perhaps focusing on triangle ABD or something else.

Alternatively, considering that angle 1 is 58°, angle 2 is 47°, angle 3 is 26°, and trying to find angle 5. Let me think of possible scenarios where these angles are parts of triangles or intersecting lines.

Let me try assuming that angle 1 is ∠AEC (58°), angle 2 is ∠ABC (47°), angle 3 is ∠EDC (26°), and angle 5 is ∠AEB or something else.

Alternatively, since there are multiple triangles, maybe using the fact that the sum of angles around a point is 360°, or that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°.

For example, in triangle EDC, angles are ∠EDC = 26°, and maybe other angles. If we can find other angles here.

Alternatively, in triangle BEC, if ∠BEC = 58°, then maybe finding other angles there.

Alternatively, looking for isosceles triangles or equilateral ones, but without side length info, hard to tell.

Another thought: maybe using the concept of exterior angles. For example, in triangle ABC, if ∠ABC is 47°, then an exterior angle might relate to other angles.

Wait, but without knowing which angles are which, it's difficult. Maybe I should assign variables to unknown angles and set up equations based on the given angles.

Let me attempt this. Assume that angle 1 is ∠BEC = 58°, angle 2 is ∠ABC = 47°, angle 3 is ∠EDC = 26°, and angle 5 is ∠AEB or something similar.

In triangle BEC, angles are ∠BEC = 58°, ∠EBC, and ∠BCE. Summing to 180°, so ∠EBC + ∠BCE = 122°. But unless we know more, this may not help.

In triangle EDC, angles are ∠EDC = 26°, ∠DEC, and ∠DCE. Sum to 180°, so ∠DEC + ∠DCE = 154°.

Alternatively, looking at triangle ABD. But I'm not sure about the connections.

Wait, maybe the key lies in identifying that some angles are supplementary or complementary.

Alternatively, if lines AE and BD intersect at a point, forming vertical angles. For example, if they cross at point O, then opposite angles would be equal.

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging. Let me think differently.

Since the answer options are 43, 47, 58, 73. The given angles are 58, 47, 26. The missing angle is likely found by subtracting or adding these.

For example, 180 - 58 - 47 = 75, not matching. Or 180 - 58 - 26 = 96. Not helpful. 

Wait, maybe angle 5 is an exterior angle. For example, if angle 5 is an exterior angle to a triangle, then it equals the sum of two remote interior angles. Let me see.

Suppose angle 5 is an exterior angle at point E, formed by extending a line. For example, if we extend EC to form an exterior angle. But without knowing which lines are extended, it's unclear.

Alternatively, think about the sum of angles around a point. For instance, if several angles meet at a point, their sum is 360°.

Alternatively, looking at triangle BDE. If I can find angles there. Let me think.

Wait, the given angles include ∠BEC = 58°, ∠EDC = 26°, and ∠ABC = 47°. Maybe these are parts of different triangles.

Let me try to imagine triangle ABC. Its angles are ∠A, ∠B=47°, ∠C. So ∠A + ∠C = 133°. But not sure.

If there's a line from B to D, which creates triangle BDE. In triangle BDE, angles at B, D, E. Suppose angle at B is part of ∠ABC (47°)? Not necessarily.

Alternatively, if ∠ABC is 47°, and BD splits it into two angles. For example, if BD intersects AC, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle ABE. If angle at B is 47°, and some other angles.

This is getting too vague. Maybe I need to consider that angle 1, 2, 3 are parts of triangles that allow us to compute angle 5 via triangle angle sums or other theorems.

Let me take a different approach. Let's list all the angles mentioned in the predicates:

1. ∠AEC (Angle(A,E,C)) = ?
2. ∠ABC (Angle(A,B,C)) = 47° (given as angle 2)
3. ∠BEC (Angle(B,E,C)) = 58° (given as angle 1)
4. ∠BCD (Angle(B,C,D)) = ?
5. ∠EDC (Angle(E,D,C)) = 26° (given as angle 3)

Assume that angle 5 is ∠BCD (Angle(B,C,D)), which is one of the given angles. Wait, but the question says to find angle 5, which may correspond to another angle. Alternatively, maybe angle 5 is ∠AEB or something else.

Wait, the problem statement says "m∠1 = 58, m∠2 = 47, and m∠3 = 26. Find the measure of ∠5." So the labels 1, 2, 3 are assigned to specific angles, and ∠5 is another angle in the figure.

Assuming that ∠1 is ∠BEC = 58°, ∠2 is ∠ABC = 47°, ∠3 is ∠EDC = 26°, then ∠5 might be ∠BCD or another angle.

Let me consider triangle BCD. It has angle at C (∠BCD), which is what I called ∠BCD (Angle(B,C,D)). To find this, maybe using triangle BCD's angle sum.

But to find ∠BCD, I need other angles in that triangle. Let's see if we can find other angles.

Looking at triangle EDC: it includes ∠EDC = 26°, and if we can find other angles here. For instance, if we can find ∠ECD or ∠CED.

Similarly, in triangle BEC: ∠BEC = 58°, and if we can find other angles there.

Let me try to work with triangle BEC. It has angles at B, E, C. We know ∠BEC = 58°. Let's denote ∠EBC as x and ∠BCE as y. Then x + y + 58 = 180 → x + y = 122°.

Now, consider triangle ABC, which has angle at B (∠ABC = 47°). If ∠EBC is part of ∠ABC, then ∠EBC = x, and ∠ABC = 47° = x + something. Wait, if line BE is drawn from B to E, then ∠ABC is split into ∠EBC and another angle. Wait, but without knowing if E is on AC or not, this is unclear.

Alternatively, if points are arranged such that E is connected to A and D, so maybe E is outside triangle ABC. This is getting too ambiguous without a diagram.

Perhaps another approach: using the fact that the sum of angles around a point is 360°. For example, if several angles meet at a point, their sum is 360.

Consider point E. At point E, we have angles like ∠AEC, ∠BEC, and possibly others. If we can find the sum of those.

From the given, ∠BEC = 58°, and ∠AEC is another angle. If those are adjacent, their sum would be part of a larger angle.

Alternatively, if lines AE and BD intersect at point E, but that doesn't make sense since AE is already connected to E.

Wait, point E is connected to D and A. So, at point E, lines ED and EA are present. Additionally, line BE connects to B. So at point E, we have lines ED, EA, and EB (assuming BE is part of the figure). Thus, the angles at E would include ∠AEB, ∠BED, and ∠AEC, depending on the arrangement.

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's still difficult. Let me try to think of another way.

Maybe using the fact that in triangle EDC, ∠EDC = 26°, and if we can find other angles. Suppose in triangle EDC, ∠EDC = 26°, ∠ECD, and ∠CED. Their sum is 180°. If we can find ∠ECD or ∠CED.

If line EC is common to triangle BEC and EDC, then ∠BCE and ∠ECD might be adjacent, forming a straight line if points B, C, D are colinear. Wait, but points B, C, D are connected by line BC and CD, so they're colinear? No, because line BC connects B to C, and line CD connects C to D, so points B, C, D are colinear. Therefore, ∠BCD is a straight line? No, because if B-C-D are colinear, then angle at C between B and D would be 180°, but that contradicts with the presence of angle ∠BCD (Angle(B,C,D)) being a valid angle. Hence, B, C, D are not colinear. So line CD is separate from BC. Hence, point C is connected to B and D, forming angle ∠BCD.

Therefore, in triangle BCD, we have angle at C (∠BCD), and sides CB and CD. If we can find other angles in triangle BCD, but without more info, it's tough.

Alternatively, if we consider triangle BCE and triangle CDE.

Wait, in triangle BCE, we have ∠BEC = 58°, and in triangle CDE, ∠EDC = 26°. If we can find some relation between these triangles.

Alternatively, if line CE is a common side between triangles BCE and CDE. Then, at point C, angles ∠BCE and ∠ECD would add up to something.

Wait, if we consider that at point C, the angles from line CB to CE and from CE to CD. If those angles are adjacent, their sum would be ∠BCD.

So ∠BCE + ∠ECD = ∠BCD. If we can find these angles.

In triangle BCE, ∠BCE is one of the angles. Let's call it y. In triangle CDE, ∠ECD is another angle, let's call it z. So y + z = ∠BCD.

But how to find y and z?

In triangle BCE: ∠BEC = 58°, and angles at B and C are x and y, respectively. So x + y = 122°.

In triangle CDE: ∠EDC = 26°, and angles at C and E are z and w, respectively. So z + w = 154°.

But without more info, it's still stuck.

Wait, but maybe there's a relationship between x and z. For example, if line BD intersects CE at some point, creating vertical angles or something. But I don't know.

Alternatively, consider triangle ABE. If ∠ABC = 47°, which is at point B, and if line BE is part of that triangle.

Wait, I'm going in circles here. Let me try to look for another approach.

Since the answer choices are 43, 47, 58, 73. Let me consider that angle 5 is the difference between two given angles. For example, 58 - 26 = 32, not in the choices. 47 - 26 = 21, nope. 58 - 47 = 11, nope. 47 + 26 = 73, which is one of the choices. Oh! 73 is an option. So if angle 5 is 47 + 26 = 73, that would make sense. How?

Maybe angle 5 is an exterior angle equal to the sum of two remote interior angles. For instance, if angle 5 is an exterior angle to a triangle where the remote angles are 47° and 26°, then 47+26=73. So that would give angle 5 as 73°, which is option D.

But how to verify this? Let's think: if there's a triangle where one of its angles is 47°, another is 26°, and angle 5 is an exterior angle to that triangle. For example, if angle 5 is an exterior angle to triangle BDE, where the remote interior angles are 47° and 26°, then angle 5 would be 73°.

Alternatively, if angle 5 is an external angle to triangle BEC, where the remote interior angles are 47° and 26°, making angle 5 = 47 + 26 = 73.

But how to confirm this? Let me think of a scenario where this applies.

Suppose we have triangle BEC with ∠BEC = 58°, and if there's a line extending from B or C forming an exterior angle. Alternatively, if there's a triangle where two angles are 47° and 26°, and the exterior angle is 73°.

Alternatively, considering that in triangle ABC, if ∠ABC = 47°, and some other angle is 26°, then an exterior angle could be 47+26=73.

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's speculative. But given the answer choices, 73 is an option, and it fits the pattern of summing the two given angles.

Alternatively, maybe angle 5 is the supplement of one of the given angles. For example, 180 - 58 = 122, which isn't an option. 180 - 47 = 133, nope. 180 - 26 = 154, nope. Not helpful.

Another possibility: if angle 5 is part of a triangle where two angles are known. For example, if angle 5 is in a triangle with angles 58° and 26°, then third angle would be 180 - 58 - 26 = 96, which isn't an option. Or 180 - 47 - 26 = 107, nope.

Alternatively, if angle 5 is part of a triangle where two angles are 58° and 47°, third angle would be 180 - 58 - 47 = 75, not in options. Closest is 73.

Hmm. But why would it be 73?

Wait, perhaps angle 5 is an exterior angle to a triangle where two remote interior angles are 47° and 26°, hence 47 + 26 = 73. That seems plausible.

Given that the answer options include 73, and the given angles are 58, 47, 26, and the possible combination of 47 + 26 = 73, it's likely that angle 5 is 73°, so the answer is D.

Thus, Final Answer: D
