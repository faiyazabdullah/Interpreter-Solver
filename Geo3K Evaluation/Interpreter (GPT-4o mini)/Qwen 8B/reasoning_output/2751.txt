MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we need to find the measure of angle YIZ given some other angles and ratios. Let me start by going through the given predicates and see how they connect.

First, the given angles: MeasureOf(Angle(D, W, X)) is 130 degrees, and MeasureOf(Angle(Y, Z, C)) is 20 degrees. Also, there are several points lying on certain lines. Points G, H, I are on lines WJ, XJ, YJ respectively. Then there are lines like WX, XY, YZ, ZC, and others involving point J. 

The main question is about angle YIZ. Let me visualize this. Maybe drawing a diagram would help, but since I can't draw, I'll try to imagine it. 

So, first, let's note down all the points and lines. Points W, X, Y, Z, D, C, G, H, I, J are mentioned. Lines include WX, XY, YZ, ZC, WJ, XJ, YJ. Also, PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(W,J)), so G is on WJ; H is on XJ; I is on YJ. 

Now, looking at the angles given. Angle D-W-X is 130°, which means at point W, between points D, W, X. Wait, but where is D? Since there's a point D, maybe part of another structure. Similarly, angle Y-Z-C is 20°, so at point Z between Y, Z, C. 

But perhaps these angles relate to other parts of the diagram. Also, the ratio IJ/XJ equals HJ/YJ. That suggests some proportionality, possibly leading to similar triangles. 

Let me think about the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. This looks like the condition for similar triangles, maybe. If two sides are proportional and included angles are equal, then triangles could be similar. But I need to see which triangles these segments belong to. 

Since I lies on YJ, H lies on XJ, and G on WJ. So, points I, H, G are on lines extending from J through Y, X, W respectively. 

Wait, the lines WJ, XJ, YJ are all passing through J. So, J is connected to W, X, Y. So, J is a common point connected to W, X, Y. Therefore, lines WJ, XJ, YJ form three different lines emanating from J. 

Points G, H, I lie on those lines. So, G is somewhere on WJ, H on XJ, I on YJ. 

Also, there are lines WX, XY, YZ, ZC. So, points W, X, Y, Z, C are connected in a way. Let me try to reconstruct the figure step by step.

Starting with points W, X, Y, Z, C. Line WX connects W and X. Then XY connects X to Y. Then YZ connects Y to Z. Then ZC connects Z to C. So, forming a polygonal chain from W to X to Y to Z to C. 

Additionally, lines WJ, XJ, YJ are present. So, J is a point connected to each of W, X, Y. So, J is connected to W, X, Y, and also to other points? Or maybe J is a separate point connected to those three points. 

Moreover, there's a point D, which is part of angle D-W-X being 130°, so angle at W between D and X. Not sure yet where D is located. Similarly, angle Y-Z-C is 20°, so at Z between Y and C. 

But maybe focusing on the given angles. The problem mentions m∠WXJ = 130°, which is the same as the given angle D-W-X. Wait, maybe D is the same as J? Wait, no. Because angle D-W-X would be ∠DWX, whereas angle WXJ is ∠WXJ. Unless D is J? But D is a distinct point since there's a point D listed separately. Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe there's confusion here. Let me check again. The initial given predicates have Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D, W, X)), 130). So, that's angle at W between D and X. So, ∠DWX = 130°. And then the question refers to m∠WXJ = 130°, which would be angle at X between W and J? Wait, no. Wait, angle WXJ is at point X? No, angle notation is typically vertex in the middle. So ∠WXJ is the angle at point X between W and J. Wait, no: the angle is formed by points W, X, J. So, vertex at X, with segments XW and XJ. So, ∠WXJ is at X. But according to the given, that angle is 130°, which was previously stated as the measure of angle DWX. So maybe there's a connection between D and J?

Alternatively, maybe there's a typo or misinterpretation. Let me re-examine. The original problem says:

"m ∠WXJ = 130 and m ∠WZG = 20".

So, ∠WXJ is at point X, between W and J. And ∠WZG is at point Z between W and G. 

Given that, let's focus on these angles. 

Also, the ratio IJ / XJ = HJ / YJ. So, if I consider triangles involving these points... For example, maybe triangle IJY and HJX? Let me think. 

Since I is on YJ, H is on XJ, so if we look at segments IJ and HJ, perhaps there's a proportionality. Let me write the ratio:

IJ / XJ = HJ / YJ → cross multiplying gives IJ * YJ = HJ * XJ. Which implies that IJ / HJ = XJ / YJ. So, the ratio of IJ to HJ equals the ratio of XJ to YJ. 

This suggests that triangles may be similar, or maybe some proportionality via the Basic Proportionality Theorem (Thales' theorem), which states that if a line divides two sides of a triangle proportionally, then it's parallel to the third side. Alternatively, maybe using the converse. 

But where are these points located? Let's consider points I and H on YJ and XJ respectively. Suppose we have a line connecting I and H. But without more info, hard to say. However, the ratio suggests that maybe lines IH and something else are parallel, but not sure yet. 

Alternatively, considering triangle XJY? Let me see. If we take triangle XJY, with points X, J, Y. Then, H is on XJ and I is on YJ. So, if we have a segment HI connecting them. Then, the ratio of IJ to XJ and HJ to YJ would imply that HI is parallel to XY? Wait, Thales' theorem says that if a line divides two sides of a triangle proportionally, then it's parallel to the third side. Here, if in triangle XJY, points H on XJ and I on YJ such that XH/HJ = YI/IJ? Wait, the given ratio is IJ / XJ = HJ / YJ. Let me rearrange:

IJ / XJ = HJ / YJ → (IJ)/(HJ) = (XJ)/(YJ). So, if we consider triangle XJY, and a line HI cutting XJ and YJ, then the ratio of segments on XJ is XH/HJ and on YJ is YI/IJ. Wait, but the given ratio is IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. Let me express variables. Let me denote:

Let’s suppose that in triangle XJY, H is on XJ and I is on YJ. Let’s define:

Let’s set XH = a, HJ = b (so XJ = a + b)

Similarly, YI = c, IJ = d (so YJ = c + d)

Then, the given ratio is IJ / XJ = HJ / YJ → d/(a+b) = b/(c+d).

Cross-multiplying: d(c + d) = b(a + b). Not sure yet.

But maybe if HI is parallel to XY? If HI || XY, then by Thales' theorem, XH / HJ = YI / IJ. Which would mean XH / HJ = YI / IJ → XH / YI = HJ / IJ. Comparing with our ratio, which is IJ / XJ = HJ / YJ → which is IJ/(a + b) = b/(c + d). But if HI || XY, then XH / HJ = YI / IJ → XH / YI = HJ / IJ → XH / YI = b/d. Not directly matching unless specific conditions. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a different triangle involved. Maybe triangle JYZ or something else. 

Alternatively, since the ratio involves IJ and HJ, perhaps considering triangle JHI and another triangle? Not sure yet. 

Let me think about the angles given. We know m∠WXJ = 130°, which is angle at X between W and J. Also, m∠WZG = 20°, which is angle at Z between W and G. 

Point G is on line WJ. So, G is somewhere along the line from W to J. Similarly, H is on XJ, I on YJ. 

Perhaps there are some cyclic quadrilaterals or intersecting lines creating certain angles. Also, since there are several points connected to J, maybe J is a significant point in the configuration. 

Another thought: Given that angle WXJ is 130°, and angle WZG is 20°, perhaps these angles relate to other parts of the diagram. Let me try to find connections between these angles and the desired angle YIZ. 

Angle YIZ is at point I, between Y and Z. So, ∠YIZ is formed by points Y, I, Z. To find its measure, perhaps we can find relations between other angles in the diagram. 

Let me try to outline steps:

1. Analyze the given angles and their implications.
2. Use the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ to find relationships between triangles or lines.
3. Find connections between the angles and the points involved in angle YIZ.
4. Apply geometric theorems to compute the desired angle.

Starting with the angles:

From the given, ∠WXJ = 130°. So, at point X, between W and J. Also, since W, X, Y are connected via lines WX, XY, so maybe triangle WXJ? 

Also, angle WZG = 20°, at point Z between W and G. Since G is on WJ, so line WG is part of line WJ. Thus, angle WZG is formed at Z between W and G. 

Let me consider triangle WZG. In triangle WZG, angle at Z is 20°, and G is on WJ. 

But how does this relate to other elements? Maybe there's a transversal or some intersection. 

Alternatively, since points W, X, Y, Z, C are connected in a chain (WX, XY, YZ, ZC), maybe forming a polygon. Also, point J is connected to W, X, Y. 

Another idea: Since points I, H, G lie on lines YJ, XJ, WJ respectively, maybe there's a system of lines from J to various points, and points I, H, G are along those. 

Looking back at the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. Let me think of this as proportions. Let me assign variables. Let’s assume that XJ = a, YJ = b. Then, the ratio IJ / XJ = HJ / YJ → IJ/a = HJ/b → IJ* b = HJ*a → IJ = (HJ * a)/b. 

But without knowing specific lengths, this might not help directly. However, if there's a similarity between triangles, this ratio might indicate that. 

Suppose there is a triangle involving XJ and YJ. For instance, if we consider triangle XJI and YJH, but not sure. 

Alternatively, since I is on YJ and H is on XJ, maybe considering triangle XIJ and something else. 

Alternatively, think about the lines connecting these points. For example, if lines WI and XH intersect at some point, but not sure. 

Alternatively, since angle WXJ is 130°, which is quite large, maybe indicating that lines WX and XJ form a large angle. 

Let me consider triangle WXJ. At point X, angle is 130°, sides XW and XJ. So, if I can find other angles in this triangle, maybe. 

But without knowing other sides or angles, it's tricky. However, maybe combining with other information. 

Also, angle at Z, WZG = 20°, which is part of triangle WZG. 

Maybe there's a relationship between these angles. 

Let me think about the entire configuration. Points W, X, Y, Z, C connected as W-X-Y-Z-C. Then, lines from J to each of W, X, Y. Points G, H, I on those lines. 

Assuming that J is outside the main polygon WXYZC, connected to each of those points. 

Now, the angle ∠WZG is at Z between W and G. Since G is on WJ, so line WG is part of line WJ. Therefore, angle WZG is between lines ZG and ZW. 

Hmm. Maybe triangle WZG has angle at Z of 20°, and GW is a line from G to W. 

But how does that relate to other parts? Perhaps there's a parallelogram or something else. 

Alternatively, since there's a lot of points connected to J, maybe J is the center of some circle or something. 

Alternatively, since there are several lines through J, maybe J is the intersection point of several lines. 

Another approach: Let's consider the angles around point J. Since lines WJ, XJ, YJ pass through J, the angles between these lines could be related. For example, angle between WJ and XJ, XJ and YJ, etc. 

But we know angle WXJ is 130°, which is at point X, not J. So, that angle is at X, not J. 

Wait, angle WXJ is at point X, so between W and J. So, that's one of the angles at X. 

Similarly, if we consider other angles at J. For example, angle between WJ and XJ, angle between XJ and YJ, etc. 

But without more info, it's challenging. 

Back to the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. Let me consider that this ratio suggests that triangles JIH and something else are similar. 

Alternatively, think about mass point geometry? Not sure. 

Alternatively, since I is on YJ and H is on XJ, maybe consider vectors or coordinate geometry. Assign coordinates to points and calculate. 

Let me try coordinate geometry. Let me place point J at the origin (0,0). Let me assign coordinates to simplify. 

Let me assume J is at (0,0). Let me choose coordinates for other points. 

For simplicity, let me set up coordinate system with J at origin. 

Let me define line XJ as x-axis. So, point X is somewhere along the positive x-axis. Let me assume X is at (x, 0). Since H is on XJ, which is the x-axis, so H is between X and J, or extended beyond. 

Similarly, YJ is another line from J. Let me assume YJ makes some angle with XJ. 

But without knowing specific angles, this might get complicated. However, given the angles at X and Z, maybe we can use that. 

At point X, angle WXJ is 130°, which is between W and J. So, line XW forms an angle of 130° with XJ (which is the x-axis). So, if XJ is along x-axis from X to J (origin), then line XW is making 130° with XJ. So, direction from X to W is 130° relative to XJ. 

Similarly, angle WZG is 20°, which is at Z between W and G. 

This seems too vague without specific coordinates. Maybe I should think differently. 

Let me recall that the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ implies that triangles JIH and something are similar. Wait, if IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ, then if we consider triangles JIH and ... ?

Wait, suppose we have triangle JXY, with points H on XJ and I on YJ. Then, the ratio IJ/YJ = HJ/XJ. Wait, no, the given is IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ → IJ/YJ = HJ/XJ. Which is equivalent to IJ/HJ = YJ/XJ. 

Which resembles the condition for similar triangles if there's a line parallel to XY. Because if HI is parallel to XY, then by the basic proportionality theorem, XH/HJ = YI/IJ. 

But our ratio is IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ → which is IJ/(XJ) = HJ/(YJ). Let me express XJ as XH + HJ. Similarly, YJ is YI + IJ. 

So substituting:

IJ/(XH + HJ) = HJ/(YI + IJ)

Cross-multiplying:

IJ*(YI + IJ) = HJ*(XH + HJ)

But unless there's more info, this doesn't resolve easily. 

However, if HI is parallel to XY, then XH/HJ = YI/IJ → which would mean XH/HJ = YI/IJ → rearranged as XH/YI = HJ/IJ. 

Comparing with the earlier equation from the given ratio: IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ → IJ/(XH+HJ) = HJ/(YI + IJ). 

Not sure if they are compatible. 

Alternatively, if HI is parallel to XY, then the ratio XH/HJ = YI/IJ. Let me call this ratio k. So, XH = k*HJ and YI = k*IJ. 

Then, XJ = XH + HJ = k*HJ + HJ = HJ(k + 1). Similarly, YJ = YI + IJ = k*IJ + IJ = IJ(k + 1). 

Thus, XJ/YJ = HJ/IJ → which implies XJ/YJ = HJ/IJ → IJ/HJ = YJ/XJ → which is the reciprocal of the given ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ. 

Wait, the given ratio is IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ → which is IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ → cross multiply: IJ*YJ = HJ*XJ → which is the same as IJ/HJ = XJ/YJ. 

Whereas, from assuming HI || XY, we have IJ/HJ = YJ/XJ → which is the same as IJ/HJ = YJ/XJ. So, this is consistent! 

Therefore, if HI is parallel to XY, then the given ratio holds. Hence, HI || XY. 

So, this tells us that segment HI is parallel to segment XY. 

That's a crucial insight. Now, knowing that HI is parallel to XY, we can use properties of parallel lines and transversals to find angles. 

Now, since HI || XY, then corresponding angles are equal. For example, the angle between HI and some line is equal to the angle between XY and the same line. 

Now, we need to relate this to angle YIZ. 

Let me recall that I is on YJ and Z is connected to Y via YZ. Also, angle YIZ is at point I between Y and Z. 

To find ∠YIZ, perhaps we can consider triangle YIZ or some other triangle involving these points. 

Let me think about the lines involved. Since HI || XY, and I is on YJ, maybe there's a way to relate angles at I with angles elsewhere. 

Alternatively, since HI is parallel to XY, the angle between HI and YJ might relate to the angle between XY and YJ. 

Wait, XY is a line from X to Y. YJ is a line from Y to J. So, angle between XY and YJ at point Y is ∠XYJ. 

But since HI is parallel to XY, then the angle between HI and YJ would be equal to ∠XYJ. 

But how does this help with angle YIZ? 

Let me try to trace. 

Since I is on YJ, and HI is parallel to XY. So, at point I, line HI is parallel to XY. 

So, if I can find the angle between HI and some other line, like YZ or something. 

Alternatively, consider triangle YIZ. To find ∠YIZ, we might need to know other angles in that triangle. 

But I'm missing some connections here. Let me try to find more relations. 

We also know angle WXJ is 130°, which is at point X between W and J. And angle WZG is 20°, which is at point Z between W and G. 

Perhaps there's a way to relate these angles to the rest. 

Let me think about triangle WXJ. At point X, angle is 130°, and we might find other angles if we know more. 

But without knowing other sides or angles, it's difficult. However, since we have HI || XY, and HI is connected to I on YJ, maybe there's a way to link this with other angles. 

Alternatively, since we have angle WZG = 20°, which is at Z between W and G. Since G is on WJ, so line WG is part of WJ. So, angle WZG is formed by lines ZG and ZW. 

Maybe triangle WZG has some relation to other parts. 

Alternatively, considering that points W, X, Y, Z, C are connected sequentially, forming a polyline. 

Let me think about the overall shape. Starting from W, connected to X, then to Y, then to Z, then to C. 

So, W-X-Y-Z-C is a chain of points. 

Also, J is connected to W, X, Y. So, J is connected to each of these points. 

Now, considering angle WZG = 20°. Point G is on WJ, so line WG is part of WJ. So, angle at Z between W and G. 

So, from point Z, lines ZW and ZG form a 20° angle. 

If I can find the position of G relative to other points, maybe that helps. 

But without more info, this is still abstract. 

Let me try to summarize what I know:

1. HI || XY due to the given ratio.
2. Need to find ∠YIZ.
3. Known angles: ∠WXJ = 130°, ∠WZG = 20°.
4. Points I, H, G are on lines YJ, XJ, WJ respectively.

Perhaps I should consider triangle YIZ and try to find its angles. Let's see.

In triangle YIZ, we need to find ∠YIZ. To do that, we need to know other angles in the triangle or relate it to other triangles. 

Alternatively, since I is on YJ, and HI || XY, maybe there's a way to find some angles at I. 

Let me consider the line HI, which is parallel to XY. At point I, line HI is parallel to XY. So, if I can find the angle between HI and YJ, that would be equal to the angle between XY and YJ, because of the parallel lines. 

What is the angle between XY and YJ? At point Y, between X and J. 

So, ∠XYJ. 

If I can find ∠XYJ, then the angle between HI and YJ at point I would be equal to that. 

Once I have that angle, perhaps I can relate it to ∠YIZ. 

Let me try to find ∠XYJ. How?

Well, at point Y, we have lines YX (from Y to X), YZ (from Y to Z), and YJ (from Y to J). 

So, ∠XYJ is the angle at Y between X and J. 

To find this angle, maybe we can use other information. 

Do we know anything about angles at Y? Well, there's the line YZ, and angle at Z is part of ∠WZG = 20°, but not sure yet. 

Alternatively, if we can find other angles in the diagram. 

Let me think about the sum of angles around point J. Since J is connected to W, X, Y. The angles between these lines would add up to 360°, but without knowing specifics, not helpful. 

Alternatively, consider triangle XYZ. Wait, but we don't know much about that. 

Alternatively, since we have HI || XY, and I is on YJ, perhaps constructing some transversal. 

Let me consider line YJ intersecting HI at I. Since HI || XY, then the angle between HI and YJ at I is equal to the angle between XY and YJ at Y. 

So, ∠HIY = ∠XYJ. 

But ∠HIY is part of triangle HIY. 

Wait, but I am trying to find ∠YIZ. Let me see. 

Point I is on YJ. So, line YI is part of YJ. So, if I consider line YI, which is along YJ, and line IZ, which goes from I to Z. 

So, ∠YIZ is the angle at I between Y and Z. 

If I can find the angle between YI (which is along YJ) and IZ, that would give ∠YIZ. 

To find this angle, maybe consider triangle IZJ or something. 

Alternatively, if I can find the slope or direction of IZ, but without coordinates, this is tough. 

Wait, but earlier we said that HI || XY, so the angle between HI and YJ is equal to ∠XYJ. Let me call this angle α. So, ∠HIY = α = ∠XYJ. 

Now, if I can find α, then maybe I can relate it to other angles. 

How to find α? ∠XYJ is the angle at Y between X and J. 

To find this angle, maybe consider triangle XYJ. In triangle XYJ, we know angle at X is ∠WXJ = 130°, but wait, that's at point X. 

Wait, in triangle XYJ, the angles at X, Y, and J. 

We know angle at X is ∠WXJ = 130°, but is that part of triangle XYJ? 

Yes, because in triangle XYJ, angle at X is between XW and XJ. Wait, but in the triangle XYJ, the angle at X is between XJ and XY. So, it's different from ∠WXJ. 

Wait, ∠WXJ is at point X between W and J. Whereas in triangle XYJ, the angle at X is between XJ and XY. So, unless W, X, Y are colinear, which they aren't (since W-X-Y are connected as a chain), so angle between XJ and XY is different from ∠WXJ. 

So, to find ∠XYJ, we need to consider triangle XYJ. 

But we need more information about triangle XYJ. 

Let me think about other angles. 

We know that angle WZG = 20°, which is at Z between W and G. Since G is on WJ, so line WG is part of WJ. 

Let me consider triangle WZG. In this triangle, angle at Z is 20°, and we might relate other angles. 

But how does this connect to other parts? 

Alternatively, since points W, X, Y, Z, C are connected in a chain, maybe there's a pattern or regularity. 

Wait, the given angle at Z is 20°, which is part of the angle at Z between Y and C. So, ∠YZC = 20°. 

So, in triangle YZC, angle at Z is 20°. 

But again, without knowing other angles or sides, not sure. 

Let me try to think of possible configurations. 

Since angle WXJ is 130°, and angle WZG is 20°, perhaps these are supplementary or complementary to other angles. 

Wait, 130° and 20° add up to 150°, which doesn't seem directly relevant. 

Alternatively, considering that angle at X (130°) and angle at Z (20°) might be related through some transversal or cyclic quadrilateral. 

But without knowing more, it's hard. 

Let me return to the HI || XY and ∠XYJ = α. 

Assume that α is the angle at Y between X and J. So, in triangle XYJ, angles are at X, Y, J. 

If I can find another angle in this triangle, I can find α. 

But how?

Let me think about the line YZ. From point Y to Z. Since Z is connected to Y, and we know ∠YZC = 20°, which is at Z between Y and C. 

Maybe there's a way to relate angle at Y with this. 

Alternatively, if I can find the sum of angles in triangle YZC. 

But again, not enough info. 

Wait, but if I consider the whole configuration, maybe there's a way to relate angles at different points. 

Let me think about the total angles around point Z. At point Z, we have lines ZY, ZC, and ZG (since G is on WJ). 

So, angle between ZY and ZC is 20°, and angle between ZY and ZG is something. 

But without knowing where G is, not sure. 

This seems stuck. Let me try another approach. 

Since HI || XY, and I is on YJ, then the angle between HI and YJ is equal to ∠XYJ. Let me call this angle α. 

Now, at point I, we have line IJ (part of YJ) and line IZ. So, ∠YIZ is adjacent to α, depending on where Z is. 

Wait, if I can find the angle between IZ and YJ, which is ∠YIZ, then that would depend on other factors. 

But how to find that? 

Perhaps by considering triangle IZJ or something. 

Alternatively, if I can find the angle between IZ and some other line. 

Wait, let me consider line ZC. Since point Z is connected to C, and there's a line ZC. 

But without knowing where C is, not helpful. 

Wait, but the given angle at Z is ∠YZC = 20°, which is part of the line ZC. 

So, at point Z, between Y and C, angle is 20°. 

If I can relate this to other parts. 

Let me think about the entire structure. Points W-X-Y-Z-C form a polyline, and J is connected to W, X, Y. 

If I can find the location of Z in relation to other points, maybe. 

Alternatively, since angle WZG = 20°, which is at Z between W and G. Since G is on WJ, so line ZG connects Z to G on WJ. 

This creates triangle WZG with angle at Z of 20°. 

Maybe using the Law of Sines or Cosines in this triangle, but without knowing any sides, it's hard. 

But perhaps there's a relation between triangles WZG and something else. 

Alternatively, since angle at Z is 20°, and angle at X is 130°, maybe there's a way to find some relation through the sum of angles in a larger triangle or quadrilateral. 

Another idea: Since HI || XY, and I is on YJ, then line HI is parallel to XY. So, if I extend some lines, maybe there's a parallelogram or something. 

But I'm not seeing it yet. 

Let me try to think about the answer options. The options are 40°, 50°, 65°, 110°. 

Given that angle WXJ is 130°, which is obtuse, and angle WZG is 20°, acute. The desired angle YIZ might be one of these. 

If I assume that ∠YIZ is 50°, which is half of 100°, or 40°, which is related to 80°, but not sure. 

Alternatively, since 130° and 20° are given, maybe their difference or sum relates. 130 - 20 = 110, which is one of the options. Or 130 + 20 = 150, not an option. 

But why would that be? 

If there's a triangle where the sum of angles is 180°, and some of the angles are 130° and 20°, but not sure. 

Wait, if there's a triangle with angles 130°, 20°, and something, then the third angle would be 30°, but that's not an option. 

Alternatively, if ∠YIZ is supplementary to 130° minus something. 

Alternatively, since HI || XY, and angle at X is 130°, maybe the corresponding angle at I is related. 

Wait, if HI || XY, then the angle between HI and YJ is equal to the angle between XY and YJ, which is α. 

If I can find α, then maybe ∠YIZ is related to α. 

Let me try to find α. 

In triangle XYJ, angles at X, Y, J. 

We know angle at X is ∠WXJ = 130°, but wait, that's not necessarily the angle at X in triangle XYJ. 

Wait, in triangle XYJ, the angle at X is between XJ and XY. While ∠WXJ is the angle at X between WX and XJ. 

Unless WX is aligned with XY, which it isn't, since W-X-Y are connected as a chain. So, these are different angles. 

So, to find angle at X in triangle XYJ, we need to know the angle between XJ and XY. 

Let me call this angle β. 

So, in triangle XYJ, angles are β at X, α at Y, and γ at J. 

Sum of angles: β + α + γ = 180°. 

But without knowing β or γ, cannot proceed. 

However, if we can find β or γ. 

But how?

Maybe through other parts of the diagram. 

For example, if we consider line WX and line XY. At point X, angle between WX and XY is 180° minus angle between WX and XJ, which is 130°, if they are on a straight line. 

Wait, no. At point X, the lines are WX, XY, and XJ. 

If we consider the full angle around point X, it's 360°, but unless we know other angles, not helpful. 

Alternatively, if we consider that line WX is connected to X, and line XJ is another line from X. So, the angle between WX and XJ is 130°, as given. 

If we can find the angle between XY and XJ, that would be β. 

But how?

Maybe by considering the straight line from X to Y and X to J. 

But without more info, this is unclear. 

Let me think about the fact that HI || XY. If I can find the angle between HI and some other line, but I'm not seeing it. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that angle YIZ is formed by lines YI and ZI. Since I is on YJ, and Z is connected to Y. 

If I can find the angle between YJ and ZI, which is ∠YIZ. 

But how? 

Wait, if I consider triangle YIZ, and if I can find two other angles, then I can find ∠YIZ. 

Let me assume that ∠YIZ is what we're seeking. 

If I can find ∠ZYI and ∠IZY, then ∠YIZ = 180° - (∠ZYI + ∠IZY). 

But how to find those angles?

∠ZYI is the angle at Y between Z and I. Since I is on YJ, this angle is the same as ∠ZYJ. 

And ∠IZY is the angle at Z between I and Y. 

But again, without knowing where I is, this is hard. 

Wait, but I is on YJ, so line YI is part of YJ. So, ∠ZYI is the angle at Y between Z and J. 

So, ∠ZYJ. 

If I can find ∠ZYJ, and ∠IZY, then I can find ∠YIZ. 

But how?

Let me consider triangle ZYJ. At point Y, angle is ∠ZYJ, at point Z, angle is ∠YZJ, and at point J, angle is ∠ZJY. 

But again, without knowing any of these angles, it's difficult. 

Wait, but ∠YZJ is part of the given angle at Z, which is ∠YZC = 20°. So, if line ZC extends from Z to C, and ∠YZC = 20°, then ∠YZJ is part of that. 

But unless J is on line ZC, which it isn't, since J is connected to W, X, Y. 

This is getting too convoluted. Maybe I need to make assumptions or find another way. 

Let me go back to the earlier conclusion that HI || XY. So, the angle between HI and YJ is equal to ∠XYJ. 

Let me call this angle α. So, ∠HIY = α = ∠XYJ. 

Now, at point I, we have line IJ (along YJ) and line IZ. So, ∠YIZ is the angle between YI (which is along YJ) and IZ. 

So, ∠YIZ = angle between YJ and IZ. 

If I can find this angle, it would be ∠YIZ. 

Let me consider triangle IZJ. In this triangle, we have angle at I is ∠YIZ, angle at Z is ∠IZJ, and angle at J is ∠IJZ. 

But without knowing any of these angles, not helpful. 

Wait, but if I can relate ∠IZJ to other angles. 

Since Z is connected to Y and C, and we know ∠YZC = 20°, which is at Z between Y and C. 

So, if line ZC is extending from Z to C, and line ZJ is extending from Z to J. 

So, the angle between ZJ and ZC is ∠CZJ. 

But how does this relate to ∠IZJ? 

If I can find ∠CZJ, then maybe relate it to ∠IZJ. 

But without knowing where C is, this is unclear. 

At this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the given angles and the options. 

Given that the answer choices are 40°, 50°, 65°, 110°, and the given angles are 130° and 20°, which add up to 150°, and subtract from 180° to get 30°, but none of the options are 30°. 

Alternatively, if the angle YIZ is supplementary to 130° - 20° = 110°, which is one of the options. 

But why would it be supplementary? 

If there's a triangle where 130° and 20° are part of it, but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, since HI || XY, and angle at X is 130°, then the corresponding angle at I would be 130°, but that might be too large. 

Alternatively, since HI || XY, and if there's a transversal crossing them, the alternate interior angles would be equal. 

But without knowing the transversal, it's hard to say. 

Wait, if HI || XY, and line YJ intersects both, then the angle between HI and YJ is equal to the angle between XY and YJ, which is α. 

If I can find α, then perhaps ∠YIZ is related to α. 

Let me assume that α is 130°, but that seems unlikely. 

Alternatively, if α is 130°, then ∠YIZ would be something else. 

But I'm stuck. 

Wait, let me think about the sum of angles around point I. 

At point I, there are lines IY (along YJ), IZ, and IH (parallel to XY). 

So, the angle between IY and IH is α, and the angle between IH and IZ would depend on other factors. 

But I don't know where Z is relative to IH. 

This is taking too long, and I need to wrap up. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll try to make an educated guess. 

Since angle WXJ is 130°, and angle WZG is 20°, and the options include 50° and 40°, which are complements or supplements to these. 

If I assume that ∠YIZ is 50°, which is 130° - 80°, or 20° * 2 + 10°, but not sure. 

Alternatively, since 130° - 20° = 110°, which is one of the options. 

Maybe ∠YIZ is 110°, but why? 

If there's a straight line or supplementary angle. 

Alternatively, if ∠YIZ is the exterior angle of some triangle, equal to the sum of two remote interior angles. 

For example, if ∠YIZ is an exterior angle, then it equals the sum of two other angles. 

But without knowing which angles, this is speculative. 

Given the options, and the presence of 130° and 20°, I think the most plausible answer is 50°, as it is half of 100°, or 130° - 80°, but not sure. 

Alternatively, 130° - 20° = 110°, which is option D. 

But why? If ∠YIZ is supplementary to 70°, or something. 

Alternatively, if there's a triangle where 130° and 20° are two angles, then the third would be 30°, but not an option. 

Wait, but if ∠YIZ is part of a triangle with angles 130° and 20°, then it would be 30°, but not an option. 

Hmm. 

Given that I'm stuck, and the options are 40, 50, 65, 110, and the given angles are 130 and 20, I'll go with 50°, as it's a common angle in such problems. 

Wait, but why 50? 

Alternatively, since angle WXJ is 130°, and angle WZG is 20°, and if there's a triangle where these angles are part of, and the remaining angle is 30°, but not an option. 

Wait, but if ∠YIZ is 50°, then 130° - 50° = 80°, and 80° - 20° = 60°, but not sure. 

I think I need to stop here and choose one of the options. Given that the problem involves a ratio leading to parallel lines, and angles of 130° and 20°, I think the answer is likely 50°, which is option B.
