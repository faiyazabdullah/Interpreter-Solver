Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the length of side AB in a triangle where we know it's a right triangle, and the other two sides are given. Let me start by recalling the given predicates.

First, Triangle(A,B,C) means we have a triangle with vertices A, B, and C. Then, there's a RightAngle at Angle(C,A,B), which I think translates to the right angle being at point A? Wait, wait. Wait, the syntax here might be confusing. In geometry, the angle notation usually is Angle(Vertex, Vertex, Vertex). So if it's RightAngle(Angle(C,A,B)), that would mean the angle at vertex A, between points C, A, and B. Wait, but the order is C-A-B. So the angle at A formed by points C, A, B. So that would make the right angle at point A. Therefore, triangle ABC is a right triangle with the right angle at A. 

So, in that case, the legs of the right triangle would be AC and AB, and the hypotenuse would be BC. Wait, no. Wait, if the right angle is at A, then the sides forming the right angle are AC and AB, and the hypotenuse is BC. But the given lengths are LengthOf(Line(C,A)) = 12, so that's AC = 12. LengthOf(Line(C,B)) = 25.5, which would be CB = 25.5. And we need to find LengthOf(Line(A,B)) = x. 

Wait, hold on. Let me confirm. If the right angle is at A, then the sides adjacent to the right angle are AC and AB, and the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle, which would be BC. So according to Pythagoras, AC² + AB² = BC². Wait, but in this case, BC is given as 25.5, AC is 12, and AB is x. So plugging into Pythagoras: 12² + x² = 25.5². Solving for x would give us sqrt(25.5² - 12²). Let me compute that.

But wait, let me check again. Is BC indeed the hypotenuse? Because if the right angle is at A, then yes, BC is the hypotenuse. So, yes, applying Pythagoras here. So let's calculate 25.5 squared minus 12 squared. Let me do the math.

First, 25.5 squared. Let me compute that. 25^2 is 625, 0.5^2 is 0.25, and cross term 2*25*0.5=25. So total is (25 + 0.5)^2 = 25^2 + 2*25*0.5 + 0.5^2 = 625 + 25 + 0.25 = 650.25. Alternatively, just multiply 25.5 * 25.5. Let me verify:

25.5 * 25.5. Well, 25 * 25 = 625. 25 * 0.5 = 12.5, 0.5 * 25 = 12.5, and 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25. Adding up: 625 + 12.5 + 12.5 + 0.25 = 625 + 25 + 0.25 = 650.25. Yes, same result.

Then 12 squared is 144. So subtracting 144 from 650.25 gives 650.25 - 144 = 506.25. Then take the square root of 506.25. What's sqrt(506.25)? Let me see. Since 22^2 is 484, 23^2 is 529. So between 22 and 23. Let me check 22.5^2. 22.5 squared is 506.25. Exactly! Because 22.5 * 22.5 = (45/2)^2 = 2025/4 = 506.25. Perfect. So x equals 22.5. 

Looking back at the answer choices, option A is 22.5. So the answer should be A. 

Wait, but let me double-check my understanding of the triangle configuration. The right angle is at A, so sides AC and AB are the legs, BC is the hypotenuse. Given AC = 12, AB = x, BC = 25.5. So yes, the calculation holds. Therefore, x is 22.5, which corresponds to answer A. 

I don't see any mistakes here. The key was correctly identifying the right angle's position and applying Pythagoras correctly. All steps seem valid. So the answer is A.
