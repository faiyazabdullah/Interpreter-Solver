MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have points A, B, C, D, E, F. There's a circle O, so all these points lie on the same circle. That means OA = OB = OC = OD = OE = OF since they're radii of the circle. Also, there are several lines mentioned: Line(B,F), Line(D,C), Line(E,A). Then there are some angle measures: RightAngle at Angle(F,A,C), which means ∠FAC is 90 degrees. Another measure says MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,D)) equals 67 degrees. And we need to find the measure of Angle(F,A,B) which is denoted as x.

So first, since all points are on the circle, maybe there are cyclic quadrilaterals or inscribed angles involved. Let me think about the angles given. 

Starting with ∠FAC being a right angle. Since point A is connected to F and C, and those points are on the circle. Maybe triangle FAC is a right triangle with the right angle at A. But since A is on the circle, perhaps the hypotenuse FC is the diameter? Wait, because if an inscribed angle subtends a semicircle, it would be a right angle. So if ∠FAC is 90°, then FC must be the diameter of the circle. Because any triangle inscribed in a circle where one side is the diameter has a right angle opposite that diameter. Therefore, FC is the diameter. So points F and C are endpoints of a diameter.

Now, looking at the angle ∠CAD is 67°, which is given. So point D is another point on the circle. Since angle CAD is formed by points C, A, D. Since A is on the circle, and C and D are also on the circle. Let me visualize this. Points C and D are on the circle, and A is another point. The angle at A between points C and D is 67 degrees. 

Since FC is the diameter, and A is a point on the circle, maybe there's some relationship here. Let me consider the arcs. In a circle, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So ∠CAD intercepts arc CD. Therefore, the measure of arc CD would be twice 67°, which is 134°. 

Also, since FC is the diameter, the arc from F to C is 180°, as it's a straight line. Now, maybe we can find other arcs. For example, if we can find the position of point D relative to F and C. But I'm not sure yet.

Another thing: Point E is on the circle, and there's a line EA. So line EA connects E to A. Not sure yet how that plays in.

But the main goal is to find the measure of angle FAB, which is x. Let's see. So angle FAB is at point A, between points F and B. So points F, A, B. Since B is on the circle too, as per PointLiesOnCircle(B, Circle(O)). So B is another point on the circle. 

Let me try to think about the arcs again. Since angle FAB is an inscribed angle. Wait, but the vertex is at A, so the angle is formed by two chords: AF and AB. Therefore, the measure of angle FAB is half the measure of the arc FB that it intercepts. Wait, but inscribed angle intercepts the arc opposite to it. So if angle FAB is at point A, then the intercepted arc is FB. Therefore, m∠FAB = ½(m arc FB).

Therefore, if I can find the measure of arc FB, then x is half of that. Alternatively, if I can find other arcs and use relationships between them.

Earlier, we found that arc CD is 134°, since ∠CAD was 67°. Also, since FC is the diameter, arc FC is 180°. Let me note that. So arc FC is 180°, and arc CD is 134°, but where is point D located relative to F and C?

Wait, the angle ∠CAD is at point A, so points C and D are such that when you look from A, the angle between CA and DA is 67°. So depending on where D is placed, the arc CD could be 134°, but maybe there's more to it. Let me consider the entire circle.

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle ABC? Or other triangles. But I need to connect this with the other information.

Also, since points B, C, D, E, F are all on the circle, maybe there are symmetries or other arcs that can be determined. Let me check if there's any information about other angles or lines. 

There's a line BF, which connects points B and F. Since F and C are endpoints of a diameter, and B is another point on the circle. So BF is a chord connecting B to F. Similarly, line DC connects D and C, and line EA connects E and A. 

Hmm. Let me think again about the angle FAB. To find x, which is ∠FAB. As earlier, if that's an inscribed angle intercepting arc FB, then x = ½ arc FB. So if I can find arc FB, then x is half of that. How can I find arc FB?

Well, maybe I can find other arcs. For instance, arc FC is 180°, as established before. Let's assume that. Arc CD is 134°, as mentioned. What about arc DF? Well, if I can find the total circumference of the circle, which is 360°, so sum of all arcs should add up to 360°. However, without knowing the positions of all points, it's hard to say. But perhaps there are relations between the arcs.

Wait, but maybe there's something else. Since angle FAB is formed by points F, A, B. Let me consider the arcs around the circle. Let me think about the positions of points. Since FC is a diameter, and A is a point on the circle, then maybe A lies somewhere on the circle. Let me imagine the circle with diameter FC. Let me place point F at the left end and C at the right end. Then point A is somewhere on the circle. 

Given that ∠FAC is 90°, which we already used to establish that FC is the diameter. Now, angle CAD is 67°, which involves points C, A, D. So from point A, looking towards C and D, forming 67°. So point D is somewhere on the circle such that when you connect AD and AC, the angle at A is 67°. 

Since arc CD is 134°, then the arc from C to D along the shorter path is 134°, implying that the longer path would be 360° - 134° = 226°, but since we're dealing with inscribed angles, the smaller arc is considered unless specified otherwise. 

Now, if I can find arc FD, or arc FB, which relates to angle FAB. Let me think. Suppose I can find the measure of arc FB. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to relate arc FB with other arcs. For example, if I can express arc FB in terms of other arcs. 

Alternatively, perhaps there are other angles or relationships involving point B. Since line BF exists. Also, point B is on the circle. 

Wait, maybe triangle FAB is related to other parts. Let me think. If I can find the measure of arc FB, then x is half of that. But how?

Alternatively, since all points are on the circle, maybe there are other inscribed angles. For instance, angle FAB intercepts arc FB, angle CAD intercepts arc CD, and maybe angle CAB intercepts arc CB. Wait, but I don't know angle CAB. 

Alternatively, since angle FAB is part of the diagram. Let me consider the full circle. Let's suppose the circle has points F, C as diameter, and others. Let me try to assign variables to arcs. 

Arc FC is 180°, as diameter. Arc CD is 134°, so from C to D is 134°. Then, what's the rest? From D back to F? Let me compute. The total circle is 360°, so arc from D to F plus arc from F to C (which is 180°) plus arc from C to D (134°)? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the arcs should form the whole circle. Let me clarify. 

Assuming points are arranged in order around the circle. Suppose starting from F, going clockwise: F → ... → C → D → ... → F. But I need to figure out the order. 

Alternatively, since we have points F, C, D, A, B, E on the circle. Without knowing the exact arrangement, it's challenging, but maybe we can deduce based on angles. 

For instance, angle CAD is 67°, which implies that arc CD is 134°, so if I can figure out where D is relative to F and C. If arc CD is 134°, then moving from C to D along the arc is 134°, which could mean that D is positioned such that when you go from C to D, you cover 134°. 

Then, what about arc DF? If I can find that, maybe. But I don't have info directly. However, maybe considering other angles. 

Alternatively, since point A is connected to F and C via the right angle, and angle CAD is 67°, maybe there's a relation between arcs involving point A. 

Wait, since angle FAB is at point A, and we need to find its measure. Let me think about the arcs that are intercepted by that angle. 

As mentioned earlier, ∠FAB intercepts arc FB. Therefore, the measure of ∠FAB is half the measure of arc FB. So if I can find arc FB, then x = ½ arc FB. 

To find arc FB, maybe I can find the measure of arc FB by considering other arcs. Let me think. 

Suppose we consider the entire circle. We know arc FC is 180°, arc CD is 134°, so if I can find other arcs like DA, AB, BE, EF, etc., adding up to 360°. But without knowing the positions of all points, it's tricky. 

Wait, but maybe there are other angles that give us more information. For example, if there are other inscribed angles or relationships. 

Alternatively, maybe triangle AFB? If I can find some angles in that triangle. But I don't have enough info. 

Wait, but since points B, C, D, E, F are on the circle, and line BF exists. Is there a possibility that BF is related to other diameters or chords? 

Alternatively, perhaps considering that angle FAB is part of a triangle with other angles. But again, not sure. 

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that the sum of arcs around the circle is 360°. Let me try to write equations. 

Let me denote the arcs as follows:

- Arc FC = 180° (since FC is diameter).
- Arc CD = 134° (from angle CAD = 67°).
- Let’s assume the arc from D to A is y°, arc from A to B is z°, arc from B to F is w°. Then, the total would be:

arc FC + arc CD + arc DA + arc AB + arc BF? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think carefully.

Actually, the entire circle consists of arcs between consecutive points. But without knowing the order of the points, this is difficult. However, since we have points F, C, D, A, B, E on the circle, but not necessarily in that order. 

Alternatively, maybe focusing on arcs that involve point A. Since point A is connected to C and D, and also to B. 

From point A, the angle CAD is 67°, which intercepts arc CD (as discussed). Then, angle FAB intercepts arc FB. Also, maybe there's another angle involving point A. 

Alternatively, since angle FAC is 90°, which is an inscribed angle. Wait, ∠FAC is 90°, which intercepts arc FC, which is the diameter. Which we already knew. 

Now, let me think about the position of point A. Since ∠FAC is 90°, point A must lie on the circle such that when you draw FA and CA, they form a right angle. Given that FC is the diameter, point A can be anywhere on the circle except F or C. 

Now, considering angle CAD is 67°, so from point A, looking at points C and D. This suggests that D is somewhere on the circle such that when you draw AD and AC, the angle between them is 67°. 

Let me think about the arcs again. Since ∠CAD intercepts arc CD, which we said is 134°. So arc CD is 134°, which is 2*67°. 

Now, if I can find the measure of arc FB, which is intercepted by angle FAB, then x = ½ arc FB. 

How can I find arc FB? Perhaps by considering other arcs. For example, if I can find the measure of arc FB by relating it to other known arcs. 

Let me consider the entire circle. Starting from point F, going through various points. Suppose we move from F to C (arc FC = 180°), then from C to D (arc CD = 134°), then from D to A (some arc), then from A to B (some arc), then from B back to F. But without knowing where D and A are relative to each other, it's unclear. 

Wait, but maybe there's another angle or relationship. For instance, since point E is on the circle and there's a line EA. But I don't have any specific information about angle involving E. 

Alternatively, maybe considering that all points are on the circle, so certain arcs are supplementary or complementary. 

Wait, here's an idea: since angle FAB is an inscribed angle intercepting arc FB, and angle CAD intercepts arc CD. Are there any relationships between these arcs? 

If I can find arc FB in terms of other arcs. Let me think. Suppose that from point F to B goes through some arc. If I can express arc FB as the sum or difference of other arcs. 

But without knowing the exact positions, this seems challenging. Maybe there's a different approach. 

Wait, since all points are on the circle, and we have several arcs. Let me consider the sum of arcs around the circle. Let's say:

Total circle = 360°.

We know arc FC = 180°, arc CD = 134°, so combined arc FC + arc CD = 180 + 134 = 314°. But that's just part of the circle. The remaining arc would be from D back to F, which would be 360 - 314 = 46°, assuming that the arc from D to F is the remaining part. But wait, that assumes that the arc from D to F is the remaining 46°, but this depends on the direction of traversal. 

Wait, if arc CD is 134°, then from point C to D is 134°, and from D back to F would be the rest of the circle. But that depends on whether the arc from D to F is the minor arc or major arc. However, since we're dealing with inscribed angles, we usually take the smaller arc unless stated otherwise. 

So, if arc CD is 134°, then the arc from D to C going the other way would be 360 - 134 = 226°, which is larger than 180°, so likely not the case. Hence, arc CD is the minor arc of 134°, making the arc from D to C (the other way) 226°, which is the major arc. 

But how does this help with arc FB? 

Maybe I need to consider that point A is somewhere on the circle. Since ∠FAC is 9 0°, which we've already used. Let me think about the position of point A. Since ∠FAC is 90°, point A lies on the circle such that when you connect F to A and C to A, they form a right angle. This implies that A is somewhere on the circle not overlapping with F or C. 

Now, angle CAD is 67°, which gives us arc CD = 134°, as before. So, if I can find where point A is in relation to D, maybe I can find more arcs. 

Let me try to imagine the circle with diameter FC. Let's fix points F and C as the ends of the diameter. Now, point D is somewhere on the circle such that the arc from C to D is 134°, so D is 134° away from C along the circumference. Then, point A is another point on the circle. 

Since angle CAD is 67°, which is formed by points C, A, D. So from point A, the angle between lines AC and AD is 67°. This suggests that point A is positioned such that when you look from A, points C and D are separated by 67°. 

This might imply that the arc from C to D passing through A is 134°, but since A is also on the circle, this might mean that A lies on the arc that completes the 134° arc from C to D. Or maybe not. It's getting complicated. 

Alternatively, since angle CAD is 67°, and it's an inscribed angle over arc CD, then arc CD is 134°, regardless of where A is, as long as it's not on the arc CD itself. Wait, no. Inscribed angle over arc CD depends on the position of A. If A is on the opposite side of the circle from arc CD, then the angle would be half the measure of the arc CD. Otherwise, if A is on the arc CD, then it would be half the measure of the opposite arc. 

Wait, this is a crucial point. The measure of an inscribed angle depends on which arc it intercepts. So if ∠CAD is formed by points C, A, D, then the intercepted arc is either arc CD or arc CBD, depending on where A is located. 

Since the measure of the angle is 67°, which is half the measure of the intercepted arc. So if the intercepted arc is CD, then arc CD is 134°, as we thought. But if the intercepted arc were the other arc (the one not containing A), then the measure would be different. 

However, since we have angle CAD, and given that A is on the circle, we need to determine which arc is intercepted. 

Assuming that A is not on arc CD, then the intercepted arc is CD, giving us arc CD = 134°. If A were on arc CD, then the intercepted arc would be the rest of the circle, which would be 360 - 134 = 226°, leading to angle CAD being 113°, which contradicts the given 67°. Therefore, A must be outside the arc CD, meaning that the intercepted arc is CD, hence arc CD = 134°. 

So, with that established, now we know arc CD is 134°, and arc FC is 180°. 

Now, trying to find arc FB. Let me think about other arcs. 

Since all points are on the circle, and we have point A. Let's consider the position of point A. Since ∠FAC is 90°, and FC is diameter, point A is somewhere on the circle. Let me consider that. 

If I can find the measure of arc FA or arc CA, that might help. 

Wait, angle FAC is 90°, which is an inscribed angle. Wait, no—angle FAC is at point A, so it intercepts arc FC. Since FC is the diameter, arc FC is 180°, so the inscribed angle over arc FC would be 90°, which matches the given condition. 

Now, what about other angles at point A? For example, angle FAB is what we need to find. Let me think about the arcs involved. 

Angle FAB intercepts arc FB. So if I can find the measure of arc FB, then x = ½ arc FB. 

To find arc FB, perhaps I can find the measure of arc FB by subtracting other arcs from the total circle. 

We know arc FC is 180°, arc CD is 134°. Let me try to find arc DF. 

If I consider the arc from D to F, which would be the arc that goes from D to F, not passing through C. Since arc CD is 134°, and arc FC is 180°, then arc DF would be arc DC + arc CF? No, that's not right. Let me think differently. 

Imagine the circle with points F and C as the ends of the diameter. Point D is somewhere on the circle such that arc CD is 134°. So from point C, moving 134° along the circumference reaches point D. Depending on the direction, but assuming the standard counterclockwise direction, point D is 134° counterclockwise from C. 

Now, point A is somewhere on the circle. Since ∠FAC is 90°, point A is located such that when you connect A to F and C, you get a right angle. This happens when A is on the circle, and FC is the diameter. So point A can be anywhere on the circle except F or C. 

Now, angle CAD is 67°, which means that from point A, the angle between CA and DA is 67°. So, point A is located such that when you draw lines from A to C and from A to D, the angle between them is 67°. 

At this point, I think I need to find the relationship between arc FB and other arcs. Maybe there's another angle or arc that can help. 

Alternatively, since all points are on the circle, and we have several arcs. Let me try to calculate the total of known arcs and see what remains. 

Arc FC = 180°, arc CD = 134°, so together that's 314°. The remaining arc from D back to F is 360 - 314 = 46°. So arc DF is 46°. 

Wait, this assumes that the arc from D to F is the minor arc, which is 46°, making the total circle 180 + 134 + 46 = 360°. 

So arc DF = 46°. 

Now, what about arc FB? To find arc FB, I need to consider the path from F to B. But where is point B on the circle? 

Point B is on the circle, and there's a line BF. So point B is somewhere on the circle, connected to F. 

If I can find the arc from F to B, which would depend on where B is located. 

But how? Maybe there's another angle or relationship involving point B. 

Wait, there's a line EA. Point E is on the circle, and line EA connects E to A. But I don't have any specific information about angle involving E. 

Alternatively, since all points are on the circle, and we know arc DF is 46°, maybe there's a way to relate this to arc FB. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's symmetry or another angle that can help. 

Wait, since angle FAB intercepts arc FB, and we need to find x = ½ arc FB. If I can find arc FB, then I can find x. 

Is there a way to find arc FB using other arcs? 

Let me think about the position of point A. Since angle CAD is 67°, and arc CD is 134°, and arc DF is 46°, maybe there's a way to relate arc FA or arc DA. 

From point A, if I can find the measure of arc FA or arc DA, then maybe I can find arc FB. 

Let me consider the position of point A. Since ∠FAC is 90°, and arc FC is 180°, point A is somewhere on the circle. Let me try to find the arc from F to A. 

Let me assume that arc FA is some measure, say y. Then, since arc FC is 180°, arc from A to C would be 180° - y. 

But also, angle CAD is 67°, which involves arc CD = 134°. Let me try to relate this. 

From point A, the angle between CA and DA is 67°, which intercepts arc CD. So arc CD is 134°, which we already have. 

But how does this help with arc FA? 

Perhaps by considering triangle ACD or something else. 

Alternatively, since we know arc CD is 134°, and arc DF is 46°, maybe we can find arc DA. 

From point D to F is 46°, and from D to C is 134°, so if we go from D to C to F, that's 134° + 180°? No, that doesn't fit. 

Wait, arc from D to C is 134°, and arc from C to F is 180°, so total from D to F via C is 134 + 180 = 314°, which is the same as before. 

But arc from D to F directly is 46°, so the arc from D to F is the minor arc of 46°. 

Now, if I can find the arc from D to A, maybe I can relate it to other arcs. 

Let me consider that point A is somewhere on the circle. From point D, moving along the circle to A, then to B, then to F. 

But without knowing where A is, it's still ambiguous. 

Wait, perhaps there's another angle involving point A. Since point A is connected to B via line AB, which forms angle FAB. 

Wait, if I can find the measure of arc AB, then maybe combine with other arcs. 

Alternatively, since arc DF is 46°, and arc CD is 134°, and arc FC is 180°, maybe there's a way to relate arc FB through these. 

But I'm stuck here. Let me think again. 

We know arc DF is 46°. If I can find arc DA, then arc from D to A plus arc from A to F would give arc DF. 

Wait, arc from D to A plus arc from A to F equals arc DF? Only if the points are ordered D-A-F. But I don't know the order. 

Alternatively, if I assume that point A is positioned such that arc DA is part of the circle. 

Let me try to think about the entire circle. Total circle is 360°. We have arc FC = 180°, arc CD = 134°, arc DF = 46°. That accounts for 180 + 134 + 46 = 360°. Wait, that adds up to 360°, so that suggests that points F, C, D, and F are in that order around the circle. 

Wait, that would mean that the circle is divided into three arcs: from F to C (180°), C to D (134°), and D back to F (46°). So the order of the points would be F -> C -> D -> F, completing the circle. 

But where is point A in this scenario? 

Point A is somewhere on the circle. Since ∠FAC is 90°, and arc FC is 180°, point A could be anywhere else on the circle, but it needs to satisfy the angle CAD = 67°. 

Let me imagine the circle with F and C as diameter, D located 134° from C, and arc DF is 46°. 

So from point D, moving 46° along the circle gets us back to F. 

Now, where is point A? Since angle CAD is 67°, which intercepts arc CD = 134°, as discussed earlier. 

So point A is positioned such that when you draw lines from A to C and A to D, the angle between them is 67°, which requires that A is not on the arc CD. 

Given that arc CD is 134°, and the rest of the circle is 360 - 134 = 226°, so point A is somewhere on the remaining 226° of the circle. 

But how does this help us find arc FB? 

Maybe point A is somewhere on the arc DF? Or elsewhere? 

Alternatively, since point A is connected to B via line AB, and we need to find angle FAB. 

Wait, maybe there's another relationship. If I can find the measure of arc FB by considering other arcs. 

Since arc DF is 46°, and arc FC is 180°, maybe there's a way to find arc FB by considering the position of point B. 

But I don't have any direct information about point B. 

Wait, but there's a line BF. So point B is somewhere on the circle, connected to F. 

Let me consider that arc FB is what we need. If I can find arc FB, then x = ½ arc FB. 

But how? 

Maybe there's another angle involving point B. 

Wait, there's no explicit information about angles involving B, except for angle FAB. 

Unless... wait! Since all points are on the circle, and line BF exists, maybe there's a relationship between arc FB and other arcs. 

But I'm missing a key insight here. 

Let me think again about the arc FB. If I can express arc FB in terms of other arcs. 

We know arc DF is 46°, and arc FC is 180°. If I can find arc from D to B, then arc from B to F would be arc DF minus arc DB, or something like that. 

But without knowing where B is, this is impossible. 

Wait, but maybe there's a connection between point A and point B. Since both are on the circle, and there's a line AB. 

Wait, let me think: angle FAB is at point A, between F and B. So if I can find the measure of arc FB, which is intercepted by this angle, then x = ½ arc FB. 

But how do I find arc FB? 

Wait, maybe there's a way to relate arc FB to arc CD or arc DF. 

Let me consider that the total circle is 360°, and we know arc FC = 180°, arc CD = 134°, arc DF = 46°. 

If I can find arc from D to B to F, but I don't know where B is. 

Alternatively, maybe point B is located such that arc FB corresponds to something. 

Wait, perhaps there's a symmetry or another angle. 

Wait, what if I consider triangle AFB? It's an inscribed triangle. If I can find other angles in this triangle. 

But without more information, it's difficult. 

Wait, but we know that angle FAB is x, and we need to find x. Let me recall that in the circle, the sum of arcs around the circle is 360°. If I can find arc FB, then x = ½ arc FB. 

Let me try to think of the arc FB as part of the circle. If I can find it by considering the remaining arcs. 

But I'm stuck. Maybe I need to revisit the initial assumptions. 

Earlier, I assumed that arc DF is 46°, which comes from total circle minus arc FC and arc CD. But is that accurate? 

Let me recheck that calculation. 

Arc FC is 180°, arc CD is 134°, so combined they are 180 + 134 = 314°. The remaining arc from D back to F is 360 - 314 = 46°, yes. So arc DF is 46°. 

Now, if I consider point A, which is on the circle, and angle CAD is 67°, which intercepts arc CD. So point A is not on arc CD. 

Now, if I can find the arc from D to A, then arc from A to F would be arc DF - arc DA. 

Wait, arc from D to F is 46°, so if I can find arc DA, then arc AF = 46° - arc DA. 

But how to find arc DA? 

From point A, angle CAD is 67°, which intercepts arc CD = 134°. So, the position of A affects the arc DA. 

Let me think about the inscribed angle theorem again. The measure of angle CAD is half the measure of the intercepted arc. But the intercepted arc depends on where A is. 

If A is on the opposite side of the circle from arc CD, then the intercepted arc is CD = 134°, giving angle CAD = 67°, which matches. 

So, if A is on the opposite side of the circle from arc CD, then arc DA would be the arc from D to A passing through the opposite side. 

But how does this help? 

Let me try to imagine the circle with points F, C, D arranged as described. Point A is on the opposite side from arc CD, so it's on the arc that goes from D through F to C, but since arc DF is 46°, and arc FC is 180°, then arc from D to A would pass through F and C. 

Wait, if arc DF is 46°, then from D to F is 46°, and from F to C is 180°, so from D to C via F is 46 + 180 = 226°, which is the major arc. 

But point A is on the opposite side from arc CD, so it's on the arc that goes from D through F to C, but not including the arc CD. 

Wait, this is getting too abstract. Let me try to define arcs numerically. 

Let me denote the arcs as follows:

- Arc FC = 180°
- Arc CD = 134°
- Arc DF = 46°
- Arc FA = ?
- Arc AB = ?
- Arc BF = ? (this is what we need)

Total of all arcs should be 360°. 

But we have arc FC + arc CD + arc DF = 180 + 134 + 46 = 360°, which suggests that points F, C, D, and F form a closed loop, implying that the arc from D back to F is 46°, and the rest of the circle is covered. 

Wait, this suggests that the circle is divided into three arcs: FC (180°), CD (134°), and DF (46°). So the points are arranged in the order F -> C -> D -> F. 

In this case, point A is somewhere on the circle, not on arc CD. Since angle CAD is 67°, which intercepts arc CD (134°), point A must be on the arc that does not contain CD, which is the arc F-D-F. 

Wait, but arc DF is 46°, so if point A is on the arc from D to F (46°), then angle CAD would intercept arc CD. 

Wait, let me think. If point A is on arc DF, then from point A, the angle between CA and DA would intercept arc CD. 

Yes, because if A is on arc DF, then the angle at A between C and D would intercept the arc CD. 

So, if point A is on arc DF, then the measure of angle CAD is half the measure of arc CD, which is 67°, matching the given information. 

So, point A is on arc DF, which is 46°. 

Now, arc DF is 46°, and point A is somewhere on it. 

Now, we need to find arc FB. Since point B is on the circle, and there's a line BF. 

But where is point B? It's another point on the circle. Since there's no information about B except that it's on the circle and connected to F via line BF. 

But since all points are on the circle, and we have points F, C, D, A, and B, maybe B is another point on the arc DF or somewhere else. 

Wait, but if point A is on arc DF (46°), and there's a line BF, then point B could be anywhere on the circle. 

But without more information, how can I determine arc FB? 

Wait, maybe there's another angle involving point B. For example, if there's a right angle or another given angle. 

Looking back at the predicates, the only other given angle is the right angle at ∠FAC, which we already used. 

Wait, but there's also the line EA. Point E is on the circle, and line EA connects E to A. But no specific angle is given involving E. 

Hmm. This is perplexing. Maybe there's a property I'm missing. 

Wait, since all points are on the circle, and we have several arcs. Let me think about the arc FB. 

If point A is on arc DF (46°), then the arc from D to A is some portion of the 46° arc. Let's call that arc DA = y, and arc AF = 46° - y. 

Now, angle FAB is at point A, between F and B. So, this angle intercepts arc FB. 

But to find arc FB, I need to relate it to other arcs. 

But without knowing where B is, this seems impossible. 

Wait, but maybe there's a relationship between arc AF and arc FB. 

If I can find arc AF, then maybe arc FB can be determined. 

But how? 

Let me consider that point B is somewhere on the circle, and there's a line BF. Since we need to find angle FAB, which is an inscribed angle intercepting arc FB. 

Wait, but if I can find arc FB in terms of other arcs. 

Let me think about the entire circle. The total is 360°, and we have arc FC = 180°, arc CD = 134°, arc DF = 46°, and arc FA = 46° - y, where y is arc DA. 

But I don't know y. 

However, since point A is on arc DF, and angle CAD is 67°, which we already accounted for. 

But I still don't know where point B is. 

Wait, but maybe there's another angle or relationship. Let me think about the position of point B. 

Since there's a line BF, and point B is on the circle. If I can find arc FB, then x is half of it. 

But without knowing where B is, I cannot determine arc FB. 

Wait, but maybe point B is related to other points. For example, if there's a right angle or another angle. 

Wait, the only other given is the right angle at ∠FAC, which we already used. 

I'm stuck here. Maybe there's a different approach. 

Let me try to recall that in a circle, the sum of angles around a point is 360°. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, since all points are on the circle, and we have several arcs, maybe there's a way to use the fact that the sum of arcs around the circle is 360°. 

But I already used that to find arc DF = 46°. 

Wait, maybe I can assume that point B is at a specific location. For example, if there's symmetry or if it's part of another inscribed angle. 

Alternatively, maybe the measure of x is related to the other given angles. 

Wait, the given angle is 67°, and the options are A. 23, B. 30, C. 67, D. 90. 

If I assume that x is 23°, then arc FB would be 46°, making x = 23°. 

Because if arc FB is 46°, then x = 46° / 2 = 23°, which is option A. 

But why would arc FB be 46°? 

If arc FB is 46°, then that would mean that point B is at point D. But point D is already defined. Or maybe point B is at a position such that arc FB is 46°. 

Wait, but arc DF is 46°, so if point B is at point D, then arc FB would be arc FD, which is 46°, making x = 23°. 

But point D is already a distinct point, so B cannot be D. 

Alternatively, maybe point B is somewhere such that arc FB is 46°, but how? 

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my assumption that arc DF is 46°. Let me double-check. 

Total circle is 360°. Arc FC is 180°, arc CD is 134°, so total of 314°. Remaining arc is 46°, which is arc DF. Yes. 

If arc FB is 46°, then x = 23°. But why would arc FB be 46°? Unless there's a reason. 

Wait, maybe arc FB is equal to arc DF, which is 46°, because of some symmetry or other reasons. 

But why? 

Alternatively, since point A is on arc DF, and there's a line EA, but no information about it. 

Alternatively, since there are five points on the circle: B, C, D, E, F, and A. Maybe the arc FB is part of the arc DF. 

But without knowing where B is, this is speculative. 

Wait, but maybe the problem is designed such that arc FB is 46°, leading to x = 23°. 

Given that the options include 23 (option A), and since arc DF is 46°, which is twice 23, this might be the intended path. 

But why would arc FB be 46°? 

If point B is such that arc FB is the same as arc DF, which is 46°, then x = 23°. 

But how to justify that? 

Maybe there's another angle or relationship. 

Wait, let me think: if arc FB is 46°, then angle FAB is 23°, which is option A. 

But why would arc FB be 46°? 

Maybe because of the configuration of the points. 

Since point A is on arc DF (46°), and there's a line BA, which creates angle FAB. If point B is chosen such that arc FB is 46°, then x = 23°. 

But without more information, this is an assumption. 

However, given the lack of other information, and the presence of arc DF being 46°, it's plausible that arc FB is 46°, making x = 23°. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another way. 

Wait, let's consider that the sum of angles around point A. At point A, we have angle FAC = 90°, angle CAD = 67°, and angle FAB = x. If these angles are adjacent, then the sum would be 90 + 67 + x = 180°, but that's only if they are part of a straight line. 

Wait, but angle FAC is at A between F and C, angle CAD is at A between C and D, and angle FAB is at A between F and B. These angles may not be adjacent. 

But if points B, C, D are arranged in a way that these angles are part of the same configuration. 

For example, if points B, C, D are arranged such that from point A, the angles FAC, CAD, and FAB are part of the same structure. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, this is guesswork. 

However, if I assume that the angles at A are part of a straight line or something, but I don't have enough info. 

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll proceed with the assumption that arc FB is 46°, making x = 23°, which is option A. 

Thus, the answer is A.
