Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, the question is about finding the measure of angle B in a trapezoid where the angles are given in terms of x. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to recall what a trapezoid is. A trapezoid is a quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides. These parallel sides are called bases, and the other two sides are legs. Now, the problem mentions angles A, B, C, D with measures x, 2x, 2x, and x respectively. Wait, so angles A and D are x, while angles B and C are each 2x? Or wait, the way it's written: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A)), x), so Angle A is x, Angle B is 2x, Angle C is 2x, and Angle D is x. Hmm, but in a trapezoid, consecutive angles between the bases are supplementary. That is, if the trapezoid has bases AB and CD, then angles A and D are adjacent along base AD, and angles B and C are adjacent along base BC. But since the bases are parallel, angles A and D should be supplementary if they are on the same leg. Wait, maybe I need to think more carefully.

Wait, in a trapezoid, consecutive angles between the two bases are supplementary. So if one base is AB and the other is CD, then angles at A and D are on one leg, and angles at B and C are on the other leg. So angle A + angle D = 180 degrees because they are same-side interior angles formed by the transversal AD cutting the two parallel lines AB and CD. Similarly, angles B and C would also add up to 180 degrees. 

But according to the given, angles A and D are both x. Wait, that would mean x + x = 180°, so 2x = 180°, making x = 90°. But then angles B and C are each 2x, which would be 180°, but that's impossible because the sum of angles in a quadrilateral is 360°. Let me check that again. Wait, if angles A and D are each x, then their sum is 2x. Angles B and C are each 2x, so their sum is 4x. Total sum would be 2x + 4x = 6x. Since the total sum of angles in a quadrilateral is 360°, then 6x = 360°, so x = 60°. Then angle B would be 2x = 120°, which is one of the options. But wait, earlier thought was conflicting because of the trapezoid properties. What's wrong here?

Hold on, maybe my initial assumption about which angles are adjacent is incorrect. Maybe the trapezoid isn't labeled in order? For example, in a trapezoid ABCD, the order of the vertices matters. Typically, trapezoid ABCD would have sides AB, BC, CD, DA. If AB and CD are the two bases (parallel), then angles A and D are adjacent to base AD, and angles B and C are adjacent to base BC. Therefore, angles A and D are on the same side, so they should be supplementary. Similarly, angles B and C are on the same side, so they should also be supplementary. However, according to the given, angles A and D are both x. So that would imply x + x = 180°, hence x=90°, but then angles B and C are 2x each, so 2*90=180°, but then angles B and C would each be 180°, which is impossible because a single angle in a quadrilateral can't be 180°, as that would make the shape degenerate. Therefore, there's a contradiction here unless the trapezoid is not convex. Wait, but even then, having angles of 180° would collapse the sides. So perhaps the error is in assuming that angles A and D are supplementary. Maybe the trapezoid is not labeled in the standard way?

Alternatively, perhaps the trapezoid is such that only one pair of sides is parallel. Let me consider that. Suppose AB is parallel to CD. Then angles A and D are on the left and right sides, so angle A and angle D are on different bases. Wait, if AB || CD, then angles A and D are adjacent to base AD. So angle A is between AB and AD, and angle D is between CD and DA. Since AB || CD, these two angles are consecutive interior angles, hence supplementary. Therefore, angle A + angle D = 180°. But according to the problem, angle A is x and angle D is x, so x + x = 180° → x = 90°, leading to angles B and C being 2x = 180°, which is impossible. Hence, contradiction. Therefore, my assumption must be wrong.

Wait, maybe the trapezoid is not labeled in the order I assumed. Perhaps the parallel sides are AD and BC instead of AB and CD? Let me try that. If AD || BC, then angles A and B would be adjacent to base AB. Wait, no. Let me visualize: if AD and BC are the two bases (parallel), then angles at A and B would be on one leg AB, and angles at D and C on the other leg DC. In that case, angles A and B would be on the same leg, so they would be supplementary. Wait, but according to the problem, angles A and B are x and 2x respectively. So x + 2x = 3x = 180°, so x = 60°, making angle B = 120°, which is option D. Then angles C and D would be 2x and x. Wait, let's check the total sum. Angles A=x, B=2x, C=2x, D=x. Sum is x+2x+2x+x = 6x = 360°, so x=60°, so yes. Then angle B is 2x=120°, which is option D. But how does this fit with the trapezoid properties?

So if the trapezoid has AD || BC, then angles A and B are on the same leg AB, so they are supplementary. Therefore, angle A + angle B = 180°. Given angle A is x, angle B is 2x, so x + 2x = 3x = 180°, so x=60°, hence angle B is 120°. Then angles C and D would be 2x and x. Since AD || BC, angles D and C would be on the same leg DC, so they should be supplementary. So angle D + angle C = x + 2x = 3x = 180°, which holds since x=60. Thus, all conditions are satisfied. Therefore, angle B is 120°, which is option D.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. So the step-by-step process involves recognizing the trapezoid's parallel sides, applying the property that consecutive angles between the bases are supplementary, setting up equations based on given angle measures, and solving for x. Then substituting back to find angle B.
