Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have two circles, R and S. Their diameters are given: R has a diameter of 20 units, so radius is 10 units. S has a diameter of 30 units, so radius is 15 units. Then there's a point D such that DS is 9 units. Wait, but I need to find RC. Hmm. Let me parse the given predicates again.

First, the points mentioned are R, C, D, S, B. Also, there are lines involved. For example, PointLiesOnLine(R, Line(C, B)), which means R lies on the line connecting C and B. Similarly, other points lie on various lines. Also, there are tangents: Line(R,D) is tangent to both circles R and S. Oh, wait, the tangent lines. So line RD is tangent to both circles R and S? That seems important.

Let me visualize this. There's a line RD that is tangent to both circles. Since it's tangent to circle R, which has center R, and tangent to circle S, which has center S. So the line RD touches each circle at exactly one point. But since R is the center of one circle and S is the center of another, maybe there's some relationship here.

Wait, the points R and S are centers of the circles. So the line RD is tangent to circle R, which implies that the distance from R to the line RD should be equal to the radius of circle R. Similarly, the distance from S to line RD should be equal to the radius of circle S. Because the tangent line's distance from the center equals the radius.

But how do these distances relate? Let me think. The line RD is common tangent to both circles. Therefore, if I consider the centers R and S, and the tangent line RD, then the distance between R and S can be found using the formula for the length of a common external tangent between two circles. Wait, but here the line RD is a common tangent, so maybe we can use the formula for the length of the common external tangent.

The formula for the length of the common external tangent between two circles with radii r1 and r2 and centers separated by distance d is sqrt[d² - (r1 + r2)²]. Wait, no—wait, actually, the formula for the length of the common external tangent is sqrt[d² - (r1 - r2)^2] if they're internal tangent? No, wait, let me recall correctly.

Actually, for external tangent (where the tangent doesn't cross between the circles), the length is sqrt[d² - (r1 - r2)^2]. Wait, no, that's for internal tangent. Wait, no, confusion arises. Let me get this straight.

For two circles, the length of the external tangent (where the tangent lines don't cross between the circles) is sqrt[d² - (r1 + r2)^2], but that would require that d > r1 + r2. Wait, no—that’s for the case where the tangent is external. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up internal and external tangents.

Alternatively, the length of the common external tangent between two circles with centers separated by distance d, and radii r1 and r2, is sqrt[d² - (r1 - r2)^2]. Wait, that seems more plausible. Let me check with an example. Suppose two circles with same radii, then the external tangent length would be sqrt[d² - 0] = d. Which makes sense because the external tangent lines would be parallel and the distance between them is d. Wait, no—if two circles have same radii, then the external tangent lines are parallel and the distance between the centers is d, but the length of the tangent segment between the points of tangency would be... Actually, if you imagine two circles side by side, the length of the external tangent would form a rectangle with sides d and (r1 - r2). Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, consider the line connecting the centers R and S. The external tangent lines would form similar triangles. Let me think. For the external tangent, if you draw the tangent line, then connect the centers to the tangent points. Those radii are perpendicular to the tangent line. Therefore, the lines from R and S to the tangent points are parallel. Thus, the quadrilateral formed by R, S, and the two tangent points is a trapezoid with two right angles. 

So, if we consider the line connecting R and S, and the two radii to the tangent points, those radii are both perpendicular to the tangent line, hence parallel to each other. Therefore, the distance between the centers RS can be considered as the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose legs are the difference in radii (if external tangent) or sum (if internal). Wait, for external tangent, the difference in radii?

Wait, suppose we have two circles, one with radius r1, the other r2. The external tangent lines would have the distance between centers squared equals the square of the length of the tangent plus (r1 - r2)^2. Wait, no. Let me derive it.

Imagine two circles, centers at R and S, radii r1 and r2. Let T be a point of tangency on circle R, and U on circle S. The line TU is the tangent line. RT is perpendicular to TU, and SU is also perpendicular to TU. Therefore, RT and SU are both perpendicular to TU, hence they are parallel. Therefore, the quadrilateral RTUS is a trapezoid with RT || SU and RT ⊥ TU.

Now, if we connect R to S, forming the line RS of length d. Then, the distance between RT and SU is the length of the tangent segment TU, which we can call L. However, the vertical distance between RT and SU would be |r1 - r2|, assuming external tangent. Wait, no. Wait, since RT and SU are both perpendicular to TU, the distance between the lines RT and SU is equal to the distance between R and S projected onto the direction perpendicular to RT and SU. Wait, maybe I need to consider the triangle formed by moving from R to S, and subtracting the radii.

Alternatively, if we consider translating one of the radii. Imagine shifting the radius SU down by r2 to align with RT. Then, the line RS would form a right triangle with one leg being L (the length of the tangent) and the other leg being (r1 - r2). Therefore, d² = L² + (r1 - r2)^2. Hence, L = sqrt(d² - (r1 - r2)^2).

Wait, but in our case, the line RD is tangent to both circles. So, the length of the tangent from R to the line RD is equal to the radius of R, which is 10. Similarly, the length of the tangent from S to the line RD is equal to the radius of S, which is 15. Wait, no, the line RD itself is tangent to both circles. So the distance from R to the line RD is equal to the radius of circle R, which is 10. Similarly, the distance from S to line RD is equal to the radius of circle S, which is 15.

Therefore, the line RD is a common tangent to both circles. Therefore, the distance between the centers R and S can be found via the formula for the distance between two points given the distance from each to a common tangent line. Wait, how does that work?

Alternatively, considering the line RD is tangent to both circles. The distance from R to line RD is the radius of R, which is 10, and the distance from S to line RD is the radius of S, which is 15. Now, the line RD is a single line, so the centers R and S are located on opposite sides of the line RD, or on the same side? Depending on whether it's an external or internal tangent.

Assuming that the line RD is an external tangent, the centers R and S would be on opposite sides of the line RD. In that case, the distance between R and S would be the sum of their distances to the line. Wait, no. Wait, if two points are on opposite sides of a line, the distance between them is the sum of their individual distances to the line. But if they are on the same side, it's the absolute difference.

Wait, yes! The distance between R and S would be equal to the sum of their distances to the line RD if they are on opposite sides, or the difference if they are on the same side. But in this case, since the line RD is tangent to both circles, the centers R and S must lie on opposite sides of the line RD. Otherwise, if they were on the same side, the line RD could not be tangent to both circles unless they are overlapping, which isn't the case here.

So, the distance between R and S is equal to the sum of their respective distances to line RD. So, RS = 10 + 15 = 25 units. Wait, but we also know that DS is 9 units. Wait, point D is on the line RD, right? Because the line is named Line(R,D), so points R and D are on that line. And DS is 9 units. So, D is a point on the line RD, and S is another point. Wait, but earlier we had that the distance from S to line RD is 15, which would mean that the perpendicular distance from S to line RD is 15. But if D is on line RD, then the distance from S to line RD is the same as the length of the perpendicular from S to the line, which is 15. But since D is on the line RD, then SD is along the line? Or not necessarily?

Wait, maybe I need to clarify the positions. Let me try to sketch mentally.

We have line RD. Points R and D are on this line. The circle R has center R, and the line RD is tangent to circle R. Therefore, the distance from R to line RD is zero? Wait, no. Wait, if the line passes through R, then the distance from R to the line is zero. But that contradicts the fact that the line RD is tangent to circle R. Unless the line RD is tangent at R itself. Wait, but if the line passes through R, then the tangent line at R would be the line perpendicular to the radius at R. But in this case, the line RD is passing through R, so it can't be tangent to the circle unless it's tangent at R. But a tangent line at a point on the circle would touch only at that point. However, if the line passes through R, then it intersects the circle at R and possibly another point. So, that suggests that my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, there's a contradiction here. The line RD is supposed to be tangent to circle R. But if line RD passes through R, then it cannot be tangent; it would intersect the circle at least at R, making it a secant line. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here.

Wait, going back to the given predicates. One of the predicates says Tangent(Line(R, D), Circle(R)). This means that the line connecting R and D is tangent to circle R. But if R is the center of the circle, then the line RD would pass through the center, implying that it's a secant line, not tangent. Therefore, this seems impossible. So there's a mistake in my interpretation.

Wait, maybe the line is not RD, but something else? Wait, the predicate says Tangent(Line(R, D), Circle(R)). So the line is from R to D, and it's tangent to circle R. But if that line starts at R, which is the center of the circle, then it must pass through the center. How can a line starting at the center of a circle be tangent to the circle? It can't, unless the line is tangent at the center, which is not possible because the center is inside the circle. Therefore, there must be an error in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps there's a typo in the problem statement, or perhaps I misread the predicates. Let me check again. The user wrote:

"Predicates:

PointLiesOnCircle(C, Circle(R))
PointLiesOnCircle(D, Circle(S))
Tangent(Line(R, D), Circle(R))
Tangent(Line(R, D), Circle(S))"

Ah! Wait, the line is Line(R, D), which connects points R and D. But the circle is Circle(R), which has center R. So the line RD is a line that passes through the center R and point D. For this line to be tangent to the circle centered at R, the line must touch the circle at exactly one point. But since the line passes through the center, it must intersect the circle at two points: the center is inside the circle, so the line passes through the interior. Therefore, the line RD cannot be tangent to circle R. This is a contradiction. What's wrong here?

Wait, maybe the line is not Line(R, D), but Line(R, D) is tangent to Circle(R)? Wait, that's what the predicate says. This suggests that the line RD is tangent to circle R, but that's impossible because it passes through the center. Therefore, there's a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the line is not Line(R, D), but Line(R, D) refers to a different construction. Wait, no—the predicate is written as Tangent(Line(R, D), Circle(R)), which means the line connecting points R and D is tangent to the circle R. But this is impossible as explained.

This suggests that there's a misunderstanding. Maybe the line is not Line(R, D), but rather Line(R, D) is a different line? Or perhaps the line is tangent to the circle at a different point. Alternatively, maybe the line RD is tangent to the circle S, not R? Wait, no, the predicate says Tangent(Line(R, D), Circle(R)), so it's tangent to R's circle.

Wait, but this seems like a contradiction. How can a line passing through the center of a circle be tangent to it? It can't. Therefore, either there's an error in the problem setup, or I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the predicates for any other clues.

Looking back at the PointLiesOnCircle(D, Circle(S)): point D lies on circle S. So, D is a point on circle S, which has center S. Therefore, the distance from S to D is the radius of circle S, which is 15 units. Wait, the problem states that DS = 9 units. Wait, that's conflicting. Because if D is on circle S, then the distance from S to D should be equal to the radius of S, which is 15. But the problem says DS = 9 units. This is a contradiction. Therefore, there's something wrong here.

Wait, hold on. The problem says "DS = 9 units". But according to the given predicates, D lies on circle S. Therefore, the distance from S to D should be equal to the radius of circle S, which is 15 units. But the problem states DS = 9 units. This inconsistency suggests that either there's a miscalculation or misinterpretation.

Wait, maybe the problem is using DS to refer to something else? Like, maybe DS is not the straight-line distance, but along a certain path? No, in geometry problems, DS usually denotes straight-line distance. Alternatively, maybe there's a translation error or mislabeling.

Wait, let me read the problem again carefully:

QUESTION:

Wait, so the problem gives that DS = 9 units. But according to the predicate, D lies on Circle(S), which would make DS equal to the radius of S, which is 15 units. But the problem says DS = 9. This is a contradiction. Therefore, either the problem has inconsistent data, or there's a misinterpretation.

Wait, perhaps DS is not the straight-line distance but something else? Or maybe the labels are swapped. Let me check the predicates again. The point D is on Circle(S), so the distance from S to D is the radius of S, which is 15. But the problem says DS = 9. So there's a conflict here. This suggests that either the problem has a mistake, or I'm misinterpreting the predicates.

Alternatively, perhaps the point D is not on Circle(S), but the predicate says PointLiesOnCircle(D, Circle(S))? Wait, no—the predicate is "PointLiesOnCircle(D, Circle(S))", which means D is on Circle(S). So that would imply that SD is the radius of S, which is 15. But the problem says DS = 9. This is conflicting.

Wait, maybe the problem uses DS to denote the length of a chord or something else, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that D lies on Circle(S), and S is not the center? Wait, but the predicate says Circle(S), which typically means the circle with center S. So if the circle is named S, its center is S. So the distance from S to D should be the radius.

This suggests that there's an error in the problem setup. But since this is a problem given to solve, perhaps I need to proceed despite this inconsistency. Alternatively, maybe I've misread the predicate. Let me check again.

Wait, the first line says "Circle(R)" and "Circle(S)", which likely indicates that the circles are named R and S, with centers at points R and S respectively. Then, "Point(LiesOnCircle(D, Circle(S))" means D is on the circle S, so the radius of circle S is the distance from S to D. Given that the diameter of S is 30 units, radius is 15. So SD should be 15. But the problem states DS = 9. This discrepancy suggests that either the problem has a typo, or perhaps the point D is not on the circle S? But the predicate explicitly states that D lies on Circle(S). 

Alternatively, maybe the problem refers to the length of DS as something else, like the length of a segment along a line, not straight-line distance? But without more context, it's hard to say. Assuming that the problem is consistent, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in interpreting the predicates. Maybe the circle S is not centered at S? But the standard notation is that Circle(X) has center X. So if the circle is named S, its center is S.

Given this contradiction, perhaps the intended meaning is that DS is not the straight-line distance but the length along a certain path? Or perhaps the problem has a typo, and the diameter of circle S is 18 units instead of 30, leading to radius 9, matching DS=9. But since the problem states diameter of S is 30, radius 15, DS=9, this is inconsistent.

Alternatively, maybe the line RD is tangent to circle S, not R? Let me check the predicates again. The predicate says Tangent(Line(R, D), Circle(R)) and Tangent(Line(R, D), Circle(S)). So the line RD is tangent to both circles R and S. So line RD is a common external tangent to both circles. But earlier, there was a contradiction about line RD passing through center R, making it impossible to be tangent. So perhaps the line RD is not passing through R? But the predicate says Line(R, D), which connects points R and D. So the line must pass through R and D. So if the line passes through R, which is the center of circle R, then it can't be tangent to circle R unless it's tangent at R. But that would mean the line RD is tangent at R, which is the center. But the tangent at a point on the circle is perpendicular to the radius. So if the line RD is tangent at R, then it must be perpendicular to the radius at R, which is the line from R to itself, which is undefined. So this is impossible.

Thus, there must be a mistake in the problem setup, or perhaps the line is not Line(R, D), but Line(R, D) refers to a different line? Or perhaps the line is not passing through R? But the name of the line is Line(R, D), which implies it connects R and D. 

At this point, I'm stuck due to contradictions in the problem setup. However, since the problem asks for RC, and there are answer choices, maybe I can proceed by ignoring the contradictions and focusing on the parts that make sense.

Assume that despite the contradictions, the line RD is a common external tangent to both circles R and S. Let's ignore the contradiction about the line passing through R and focus on the rest. So, the line RD is tangent to both circles. Therefore, the distance from R to line RD is equal to the radius of R (which is 10), and the distance from S to line RD is equal to the radius of S (which is 15). 

Now, the line RD is tangent to both circles. Let's assume that the centers R and S are positioned such that the line RD is a common external tangent. Then, the distance between centers R and S can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, considering the radii and the distance between the centers. 

Wait, earlier I thought the distance between R and S would be sqrt[(distance between centers)^2 - (difference in radii)^2], but that applies to the length of the common external tangent. Wait, no. The length of the common external tangent between two circles with radii r1 and r2, and centers separated by d, is sqrt[d^2 - (r1 - r2)^2]. Wait, but that's only if the tangent is external. So if we have two circles, and the length of the common external tangent is L, then L = sqrt[d^2 - (r1 - r2)^2].

In our case, the line RD is the common external tangent, so the length of the tangent between the two circles is the distance between the points of tangency on each circle. However, we also have that point D lies on this tangent line. Additionally, the problem states DS = 9 units. Since D is on the tangent line, and S is the center of circle S, the distance from D to S is given as 9. But according to the circle S, the radius is 15, so SD should be 15. But the problem says it's 9. This inconsistency remains.

Alternatively, perhaps DS refers to the length of the tangent from D to circle S? No, because D is on circle S, so the tangent from D to circle S would be zero. 

Alternatively, maybe D is a point on the tangent line RD, and S is the center of circle S, so DS is the distance from D to S. But if D is on the tangent line, and the line is tangent to circle S, then the distance from D to S is the length of the tangent from D to circle S. Wait, but D is on circle S, so the tangent from D to circle S would be zero. This is confusing.

Perhaps the problem has a typo, and instead of DS = 9, it should be DC = 9, or something else. Without resolving this inconsistency, it's difficult to proceed. However, given that this is a problem to solve, I'll attempt to proceed with the assumption that DS is 9, even though it conflicts with the circle S having radius 15. Perhaps there's a different configuration.

Let me try to think differently. Assume that the line RD is tangent to both circles. Let's denote the tangent points on circle R as T and on circle S as U. Then, RT is perpendicular to RD, and SU is perpendicular to RD. So, RT and SU are both perpendicular to RD, hence they are parallel to each other. The distance between the centers R and S can be found by considering the triangle formed by R, S, and the projection of one center onto the other's radius.

But since RT and SU are radii perpendicular to the tangent line, the distance between R and S is equal to the hypotenuse of a right triangle with one leg being the difference in radii (assuming external tangent) and the other being the length of the tangent segment between the points of tangency.

Wait, let me define variables. Let me denote the length of the common external tangent between the two circles as L. Then, L = sqrt[d^2 - (r1 - r2)^2], where d is the distance between centers, r1 and r2 are the radii. Here, r1 = 10 (radius of R), r2 = 15 (radius of S). So, L = sqrt[d^2 - (15 - 10)^2] = sqrt[d^2 - 25].

But in this case, the line RD is part of this common tangent. Let's say that the length from R to the point of tangency on circle R is r1 = 10, and similarly for S. But the line RD is not the entire tangent line but just a segment from R to D. However, since D is a point on the tangent line, perhaps the length from D to the point of tangency on circle S is DS = 9? 

Wait, if D is a point on the common tangent line, then the distance from D to S could be computed using the right triangle formed by S, the point of tangency U on circle S, and D. Since SU is perpendicular to RD (as it's a tangent), triangle SDU is a right triangle with SU = r2 = 15, and SD = 9. So, the length of DU would be sqrt[SD^2 - SU^2] = sqrt(9^2 - 15^2), which is imaginary. That's impossible. So this suggests another contradiction.

This indicates that there's a fundamental flaw in the problem setup. However, since the problem expects an answer, I'll have to make assumptions to resolve the inconsistencies.

Perhaps the line RD is not the common external tangent but an internal tangent. In that case, the formula for the length of the common internal tangent is sqrt[d^2 - (r1 + r2)^2]. But this requires that d > r1 + r2. 

Let's assume that the line RD is an internal tangent. Then, the distance between centers d would satisfy d^2 = L^2 + (r1 + r2)^2, where L is the length of the internal tangent. But in this case, the length of the internal tangent is zero if the circles are touching internally. Not sure.

Alternatively, if the line RD is a common internal tangent, then the distance between centers is d = sqrt[L^2 + (r1 + r2)^2]. But without knowing L, this is not helpful.

Given the confusion, perhaps I should focus on the given data: diameter of S is 30 (so radius 15), diameter of R is 20 (radius 10), and DS = 9. We need to find RC.

Assuming that D is a point on the tangent line to both circles, and DS = 9. Let's consider coordinates. Let's place the centers of the circles on a coordinate system to simplify.

Let me set up coordinates: Let's assume that the line RD is horizontal for simplicity. Let's place point R at (0, 0), and since the line RD is tangent to circle R, and the radius of R is 10, the tangent line RD must be at a distance of 10 from R. If RD is horizontal, then the tangent line would be y = 10 or y = -10. Let's choose y = 10. So the line RD is y = 10.

Now, point D is on this line. Let's say D is at (a, 10). Now, this line is also tangent to circle S, which has radius 15. The distance from center S to the line y = 10 must be equal to 15. Let's denote the center of circle S as (h, k). The distance from (h, k) to the line y = 10 is |k - 10|. This must equal 15, so |k - 10| = 15 → k = 25 or k = -5.

Assume that the line RD is above circle S, so k = 25. Then, the center S is at (h, 25). Now, the distance between centers R(0,0) and S(h,25) is sqrt[h^2 + 25^2]. 

Also, the point D(a,10) is on circle S. Wait, no, the problem says DS = 9. Wait, DS is the distance between D and S. So, DS = sqrt[(a - h)^2 + (10 - 25)^2] = sqrt[(a-h)^2 + (-15)^2] = sqrt[(a-h)^2 + 225]. According to the problem, this equals 9. So:

sqrt[(a-h)^2 + 225] = 9 → (a-h)^2 + 225 = 81 → (a-h)^2 = -144. Impossible. 

If we take k = -5, then the distance from S to the line y=10 is |-5 - 10| = 15, which works. So center S is at (h, -5). Then, DS is the distance between D(a,10) and S(h,-5): sqrt[(a - h)^2 + (10 + 5)^2] = sqrt[(a - h)^2 + 225] = 9. Again, same equation, leading to (a - h)^2 = -144. Still impossible. 

This suggests that under these assumptions, it's impossible for DS = 9. Hence, there must be an error in the problem setup. However, since this is a problem to solve, perhaps I need to reinterpret the given data.

Maybe DS is not the straight-line distance but the length along the line RD? For example, if D is on the line RD, and S is somewhere along that line, then DS could be the distance along the line. But if the line RD is tangent to both circles, then S is not on the line RD. Wait, but the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(S, Line(R, B)), meaning S lies on the line RB. 

Wait, looking back at the predicates: PointLiesOnLine(S, Line(R, B)), so S is on the line connecting R and B. Also, PointLiesOnLine(D, Line(R, B)), so D is on line RB. PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(R, S)), so B is on line RS. This suggests that points R, B, S, and D are colinear? Because S is on RB, and D is on RB, and B is on RS. So, the line RB contains points R, B, S, and D. 

So, line RB contains points R, B, S, D. Let me try to visualize this. Let's assume that R, B, S, D are collinear in some order. Let's say the order is R --- D ---- B ---- S, or some permutation. 

Given that D lies on circle S, which has center S. So, if D is on line RB, and S is also on line RB, then the distance from S to D is the distance between S and D along the line. Given that DS = 9, and S is the center of circle S, which has radius 15, then the distance from S to D is 9, which is less than the radius, so D lies inside the circle S. But the predicate says D lies on circle S, so this is a contradiction. Hence, this suggests that D is outside the circle S, making DS = 9, which is less than the radius 15. This is still conflicting.

But perhaps the problem means that D is on circle S, so DS = 15, but the problem states DS = 9, so there's a contradiction. This suggests that the problem may have a typo, and the actual intended value is 15, but it's stated as 9. Alternatively, maybe the diameter of S is 18, giving radius 9, matching DS = 9. Let's assume that the problem has a typo and the diameter of S is 18, making radius 9, then DS = 9 would make sense. With this assumption, let's proceed.

Assuming diameter of S is 18, radius 9, and DS = 9, so D is on circle S. Now, let's proceed with this corrected data.

Now, with this correction, let's analyze. The line RB contains points R, D, B, S. Let's assume the order is R, D, B, S. Or another order. Let's assume that D is between R and B, and B is between D and S. Or other possibilities. Let's try to find RC.

We need to find RC, which is the distance between R and C. From the predicates, PointLiesOnCircle(C, Circle(R)), so C is on circle R. Therefore, RC is the radius of circle R, which is 10 units. But the answer choices don't include 10, so this is impossible. Hence, this suggests that C is not the center of the circle, but another point. Wait, the predicate says Point(C), and PointLiesOnCircle(C, Circle(R)), so C is a point on circle R. Hence, RC is the radius of circle R, which is 10. But the answer choices are 4, 6, 9, 12. None of these is 10. Hence, this suggests another contradiction.

Wait, perhaps C is not the center of circle R? Wait, the predicate says Circle(R), which usually means the circle with center R. So if C is on Circle(R), then RC is the radius. But if the answer choices don't include 10, this suggests that the problem may have a different setup.

Alternatively, maybe C is not on the circle R, but on another circle? Wait, the predicate says PointLiesOnCircle(C, Circle(R)), so C is on circle R. Hence, RC is the radius. But since the answer choices don't include 10, this suggests that the problem may have a different configuration.

At this point, it's clear that there are multiple inconsistencies in the problem setup, making it unsolvable as given. However, since the problem is presented as solvable, I must have made an incorrect assumption. Let me try to revisit the original problem with fresh eyes.

Revisiting the problem: The diameter of ⊙S is 30 (radius 15), diameter of ⊙R is 20 (radius 10), and DS = 9. Need to find RC.

Given the predicates, including that D is on Circle(S), and DS = 9, which conflicts with the radius of S being 15. Let's ignore that and proceed with DS = 9, assuming that perhaps D is inside circle S, making DS = 9 < 15.

Now, the line RD is tangent to both circles. Let's assume that line RD is a common external tangent to circles R and S. The distance between centers R and S is d. The length of the common external tangent between the two circles is L = sqrt[d^2 - (r1 - r2)^2] = sqrt[d^2 - (10-15)^2] = sqrt[d^2 - 25]. 

But also, since D is on this tangent line, and DS = 9, we can relate this to the position of D. Let me consider the coordinates again. Let's place circle R at (0,0) with radius 10, and circle S at (d, 0) with radius 15. The common external tangent would have a slope, and the points of tangency would be at certain positions. Let's find the coordinates of D.

The common external tangent lines can be calculated. The distance between centers is d. The length of the external tangent is L = sqrt[d^2 - (15-10)^2] = sqrt(d^2 - 25). 

Now, let's assume that D is a point on this tangent line. Let's say the tangent line touches circle R at point T and circle S at point U. The line TD is part of this tangent line. Let's say D is a point along this tangent line, such that DS = 9.

But how to relate this? Let's consider the coordinates. Let me calculate the equations of the common external tangent.

The slope of the common external tangent can be found by considering the line connecting the centers, and the tangent lines. The slope m satisfies the condition that the distance from R to the line is 10, and from S to the line is 15. Let me use the formula for the distance from a point to a line.

Let the equation of the tangent line be y = mx + c. The distance from R(0,0) to this line is |0*m - 0 + c| / sqrt(m^2 + 1) = |c| / sqrt(m^2 + 1) = 10. Similarly, the distance from S(d, 0) to this line is |m*d - 0 + c| / sqrt(m^2 + 1) = |md + c| / sqrt(m^2 + 1) = 15.

So we have two equations:

1. |c| = 10 * sqrt(m^2 + 1)
2. |md + c| = 15 * sqrt(m^2 + 1)

Assuming the tangent is above the x-axis, c is positive, and md + c is positive or negative depending on the sign. Let's assume the upper external tangent, so c > 0 and md + c > 0. Then:

From 1: c = 10 * sqrt(m^2 + 1)

From 2: md + c = 15 * sqrt(m^2 + 1) → md = 5 * sqrt(m^2 + 1)

Let me divide equation 2 by equation 1: (md)/c = 5/10 = 1/2 → md = (1/2)c. Substituting c from equation 1: md = (1/2)*10*sqrt(m^2 + 1) = 5*sqrt(m^2 + 1). But from equation 2, md = 5*sqrt(m^2 + 1). So this holds true. 

Now, we can express m in terms of d. Let's solve for m:

From md = 5*sqrt(m^2 + 1) → square both sides: m^2d^2 = 25(m^2 + 1) → m^2d^2 - 25m^2 = 25 → m^2(d^2 - 25) = 25 → m^2 = 25/(d^2 - 25). 

This shows that d^2 > 25, which makes sense for external tangent.

Now, we need to relate this to point D. Let's find the coordinates of D. Since D is on the tangent line y = mx + c, and it's also on the line connecting R and S? No, D is on the tangent line, but where is D located?

Wait, the problem states that D is on line RB, which contains points R, B, S. Earlier, we determined that points R, B, S, D are collinear. So, D is on the line RB, which is the same line as the line connecting R and S, since B is on Line(R, S). So, the line RB is the same as line RS, which contains points R, B, S, and D. 

Thus, the line RD is part of line RS. But earlier, we assumed the tangent line is separate. This suggests that the line RD is the same as line RS, which contains points R, D, B, S. Therefore, the line RD is the line RS, and the tangent line to both circles is this line RS. But this would mean that line RS is tangent to both circles, which is only possible if the line RS is tangent to both circles, which would mean that it touches each circle at exactly one point. 

But if line RS is tangent to circle R, then it must touch circle R at one point. Since R is the center of circle R, the line RS passes through R, so it can't be tangent to circle R unless it is tangent at R, which is impossible. Hence, this brings us back to the previous contradiction.

However, if we assume that the line RS is tangent to both circles, then the distance from R to line RS is zero (since it passes through R), which contradicts the requirement for tangency. This suggests that the line RS cannot be tangent to both circles. Hence, there's a contradiction in the problem setup.

Given all these contradictions, it's possible that the intended problem had different parameters, such as the diameter of S being 18 (making radius 9), and DS = 9, which would make sense. With this assumption, let's proceed.

Assume diameter of S is 18 (radius 9), so DS = 9 means D is on circle S. Now, line RD is tangent to both circles. Let's assume that line RD is the common external tangent. The distance between centers R and S is d. The length of the common external tangent is L = sqrt[d^2 - (r1 - r2)^2] = sqrt[d^2 - (10-9)^2] = sqrt(d^2 - 1). 

Now, since D is on this tangent line, and DS = 9, which is the radius of S. Let's consider the position of D. If D is on the tangent line, then the distance from D to S is 9. Let's assume that D is the point of tangency on circle S. Then, the distance from S to D is the radius, 9, which matches DS = 9. Thus, D is the point of tangency on circle S. Similarly, the distance from R to the tangent line is 10, so the distance from R to D is the length from R to the point of tangency on circle R, which would be the radius, 10. But D is on the tangent line, so the distance from R to D is the length of the tangent from R to the line, which is 10. 

Wait, but if D is the point of tangency on circle S, then the distance from R to D would be the length of the line from R to D, which is not necessarily the radius. Let me think.

Let me use coordinates again. Place R at (0,0), S at (d, 0). The common external tangent touches circle R at T and circle S at U. Let's say D is the point U on circle S. So, DS = 9, which is the radius of S, so S is at (d, 0), and U is at (d - 9*(direction of tangent)). Wait, this is getting too vague.

Alternatively, since D is the point of tangency on circle S, the line RD is the tangent line at D for circle S. Therefore, the line RD is perpendicular to the radius SD. Since S is at (d, 0) and D is on circle S, the vector SD is from S to D, which is radial. The line RD is perpendicular to SD. So, the line RD is perpendicular to SD. 

Let me calculate this. Let's say D has coordinates (x, y). Since D is on circle S, (x - d)^2 + y^2 = 9^2. Also, the line RD is perpendicular to SD. Vector SD is (x - d, y), and vector RD is (x, y). These vectors must be perpendicular, so their dot product is zero:

(x - d)x + y*y = 0 → x(x - d) + y^2 = 0 → x^2 - dx + y^2 = 0.

But since D is on circle S, (x - d)^2 + y^2 = 81 → x^2 - 2dx + d^2 + y^2 = 81. Substitute x^2 + y^2 from the previous equation: x^2 + y^2 = dx. So substitute into the circle equation:

dx - 2dx + d^2 = 81 → -dx + d^2 = 81 → d^2 - dx = 81 → x = (d^2 - 81)/d.

Now, since the line RD is also tangent to circle R, which has center at (0,0) and radius 10. The line RD passes through R(0,0) and D(x, y). The distance from R to the line RD is zero, since the line passes through R, which contradicts the requirement for tangency. Hence, this is impossible. 

This confirms that if D is the point of tangency on circle S, the line RD passes through R, making it impossible for it to be tangent to circle R. Hence, the only possibility is that the line RD is not passing through R, but this contradicts the predicate Line(R, D
