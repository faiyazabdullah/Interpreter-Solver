MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have some given predicates here. Let me start by breaking them down one by one.

First, there's a RightAngle predicate for Angle(B, A, C). That means the angle at point A between points B and C is a right angle. Wait, no—wait, the notation Angle(B, A, C) would mean the angle at point A formed by points B, A, C. So yes, angle BAC is a right angle. So triangle ABC has a right angle at A.

Then, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A, C, B)), 60). Hmm, the measure of angle ACB is 60 degrees? Because Angle(A, C, B) is the angle at point C between points A, C, B. So angle at C is 60 degrees. Wait, but if the triangle has a right angle at A and another angle at C being 60 degrees, then the third angle at B would be... Well, angles in a triangle add up to 180. So right angle is 90, plus 60 makes 150, so the remaining angle at B is 30 degrees. So triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at A, with angles 90°, 60°, and 30°.

Next, LengthOf(Line(A,B)) is 15. So AB = 15 units. Then, LengthOf(Line(A,C)) is x, and LengthOf(Line(B,C)) is y. We need to find x.

So, since it's a right-angled triangle at A, sides AB and AC are the legs, and BC is the hypotenuse. Wait, but wait—if the right angle is at A, then BC is the hypotenuse. But according to the angles, angle at C is 60°, so maybe I should use trigonometry here.

Let me sketch the triangle mentally. Point A is the right angle. So AB and AC are perpendicular. Then BC is opposite the right angle. Given angle at C is 60°, so angle ACB is 60°, which is adjacent to side AC and opposite to AB. Wait, let me think about the sides.

In triangle ABC, right-angled at A. So sides:

AB and AC are legs, BC is hypotenuse.

Angles:

At A: 90°, at C: 60°, so angle at B is 30°.

Therefore, the sides relate to the angles. In a right-angled triangle, the sides are proportional to the sine and cosine of the angles.

Alternatively, since angle at C is 60°, and angle at B is 30°, the sides opposite these angles would be in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2.

Wait, in a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides opposite 30°, 60°, and 90° are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. So the side opposite 30° is the shortest leg, then the other leg is √3 times that, and hypotenuse is twice the shortest leg.

But here, angle at B is 30°, so the side opposite angle B is AC. Because angle B is at point B, so the opposite side is AC. Similarly, angle at C is 60°, so the opposite side is AB.

Wait, let me clarify:

In triangle ABC, with right angle at A.

So:

- Side opposite angle A (which is the right angle) is BC (hypotenuse).

- Side opposite angle B is AC.

- Side opposite angle C is AB.

Given angle at C is 60°, so angle C = 60°, so the side opposite angle C is AB. Therefore, AB is opposite 60°, and AC is opposite angle B, which is 30°.

Thus, in a standard 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are:

Opposite 30°: shortest leg (let's say length x)

Opposite 60°: longer leg (√3 x)

Hypotenuse: 2x.

But here, angle at B is 30°, so the side opposite angle B (which is AC) is the shorter leg. And the side opposite angle C (which is AB) is the longer leg. Therefore:

AB (opposite 60°) = √3 * AC (opposite 30°)

So AB / AC = √3 → AB = √3 * AC.

We know AB is 15. Therefore:

15 = √3 * AC → AC = 15 / √3 = 5√3. Rationalizing the denominator gives 5√3.

So x, which is the length of AC, is 5√3. Looking at the options, that's choice B.

Wait, let me check again. Maybe I mixed up something.

Alternatively, perhaps using Pythagoras. Since it's a right triangle, AB² + AC² = BC². Also, knowing the angles, perhaps using trig ratios.

Since angle at C is 60°, tan(angle C) = opposite over adjacent. For angle C, the opposite side is AB, and adjacent is AC.

tan(60°) = AB / AC → tan(60°) is √3, so √3 = AB / AC → AB = AC * √3. Which again leads to AB = 15 = AC * √3 → AC = 15 / √3 = 5√3. Same result.

Yes, so x is 5√3, so answer B.
