MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, we have several predicates given, and we need to find the measure of angle 14, given that angle 1 is 123 degrees. Hmm, first, I should parse all these predicates to understand the structure of the figure.

Starting with the points and lines. There are lines mentioned like Line(G, M), Line(N, E), Line(F, I), Line(J, H). Then there are angles listed: Angle(G, U, E), Angle(N, Q, M), Angle(J, A, I), Angle(F, K, H), Angle(F, J, A), Angle(K, U, Q). Also, some points lying on lines: PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(G, M)), PointLiesOnLine(Q, Line(N, E)), etc. 

Wait, so maybe there are multiple lines intersecting each other, forming various angles. Let me try to visualize this. Maybe drawing a rough sketch would help, but since I can't draw, I'll have to imagine it based on the given info.

First, let's note down all the lines and points involved. Lines are defined by two points, so:

Lines:
- Line GM (points G and M)
- Line NE (N and E)
- Line FI (F and I)
- Line JH (J and H)

Angles:
- Angle at U between G and E: ∠GUE
- Angle at Q between N and M: ∠NQM
- Angle at A between J and I: ∠JAI
- Angle at K between F and H: ∠FKH
- Angle at J between F and A: ∠FJA
- Angle at K between U and Q: ∠KUQ

Points lying on lines:
- A lies on Line GM
- Q lies on Line NE
- U lies on Line NE
- K lies on Line GM
- F lies on Line FI (so F is one endpoint)
- H lies on Line JH (so H is one endpoint)
- J lies on Line JH (same line)
- E lies on Line NE
- M lies on Line GM
- U lies on Line FI

So, putting this together, perhaps there are several lines intersecting, creating various angles. For example, Line NE has points N, E, U, Q? Wait, because U is on NE, Q is on NE. Similarly, Line GM has points G, M, K, A. And Line FI has F, I, with U on FI. Line JH has J, H, with J also on JH?

Wait, the point U is on Line FI (from PointLiesOnLine(U, Line(F, I))). So U is on both Line FI and Line NE? Because U is on Line NE as per PointLiesOnLine(U, Line(N, E)). Therefore, Line FI and Line NE intersect at point U. Similarly, Line GM has points G, M, K, A. And Line NE intersects with Line GM at point K? Wait, K is on Line GM (PointLiesOnLine(K, Line(G, M))) and also U is on Line FI. Hmm, getting a bit tangled here.

Let me list out all the points and their positions:

Points on Line NE: N, E, U, Q. Since U and Q are on Line NE. Points on Line GM: G, M, K, A. Points on Line FI: F, I, U. Points on Line JH: J, H, and since J is on JH, and H is on JH. Also, Point A is on Line GM. Point K is on Line GM. Also, Point U is on Line FI and Line NE. So U is the intersection of FI and NE. 

Now, looking at the angles. Let's see:

Angle GUE: This is formed by points G, U, E. So vertex at U, with sides going to G and E. But wait, G is on Line GM, and E is on Line NE. Since U is the intersection of FI and NE, so E is on NE, so the angle at U between G and E would involve lines connecting U to G and U to E. But where is G located? On Line GM. So Line GM passes through G, K, A, M. So if we connect U to G, that's a line from U to G, which may form part of another line? Not sure yet.

Another angle is NQM: Vertex at Q, with sides N and M. Since Q is on Line NE, and M is on Line GM. So NQM is an angle at Q, between N and M. So line NQ (since Q is on NE) and line QM? Wait, M is on Line GM, so QM connects Q to M. So that forms angle NQM at Q.

Then, Angle JAI: Vertex at A, between J and I. So line AJ and AI. But A is on Line GM. J is on Line JH, and I is on Line FI. So AJ is a line from A to J, and AI is a line from A to I. Hmm.

Angle FKH: Vertex at K, between F and H. So lines KF and KH. K is on Line GM, F is on Line FI, H is on Line JH. So KF connects K to F, and KH connects K to H.

Angle FJA: Vertex at J, between F and A. So lines JF and JA. Since J is on Line JH, F is on Line FI. So JF is part of Line FI (if J is connected to F?), but J is on Line JH. Wait, unless JF is a separate line. Need to think about how these lines interact.

Angle KUQ: Vertex at U, between K and Q. So lines UK and UQ. K is on Line GM, U is on Line FI and NE, Q is on Line NE. So UK connects U to K, which is on Line GM, and UQ is along Line NE towards Q.

Also, given that m∠1 = 123°, which is probably referring to one of these angles. But the question asks for ∠14. So maybe the angles are labeled 1 through 14 in some order, but without seeing the diagram, it's tricky. However, the labels might correspond to the angles listed above. Alternatively, maybe the numbers refer to specific angles in the figure, such as those formed by intersections.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles mentioned in the predicates are labeled as 1 through 14. But without knowing the exact labeling, this could be challenging. However, given that angle 1 is given as 123°, we need to relate that to other angles to find angle 14.

But maybe there's a way to use the given angles and their relationships. Let me think about the angles given:

Looking at the angles:

- ∠GUE: At U, involving G and E. Since U is on FI and NE, and G is on GM. So line GU connects G to U, and UE is part of NE. So ∠GUE is formed by GU and UE.

- ∠NQM: At Q, involving N and M. N is on NE, Q is on NE, so NQ is part of NE. M is on GM, so QM connects Q to M.

- ∠JAI: At A, involving J and I. A is on GM, J is on JH, I is on FI. So lines AJ and AI.

- ∠FKH: At K, involving F and H. K is on GM, F is on FI, H is on JH.

- ∠FJA: At J, involving F and A. So lines JF and JA.

- ∠KUQ: At U, involving K and Q. So lines UK and UQ.

Additionally, there are points lying on lines, so maybe certain lines are intersecting, creating vertical angles, supplementary angles, etc.

Since the problem involves finding angle 14, which isn't directly mentioned in the given angles, but likely refers to one of them. Perhaps the angles listed in the predicates are numbered sequentially, but without more info, it's hard to know. However, since angle 1 is given as 123°, and we need to find angle 14, maybe they are part of a series of angles formed by intersecting lines.

Alternatively, considering that some of these angles might be vertical angles, corresponding angles, or supplementary. Let me think about the relationships.

For instance, ∠KUQ is at point U, between K and Q. Since K is on GM and U is on FI, and Q is on NE. So line UK connects U to K (on GM), and UQ is along NE. So ∠KUQ is adjacent to other angles at point U.

Similarly, ∠GUE is at point U, between G and E. So lines GU and UE. Since U is on FI and NE, and E is on NE, so UE is part of NE. GU connects U to G, which is on GM. So maybe there's a transversal here?

Alternatively, maybe there are triangles formed by these intersections. For example, if lines FI and NE intersect at U, then maybe triangle FUE or something like that. Or lines JH and FI intersecting at J or somewhere else?

Wait, Line JH includes points J and H. Also, Point J lies on Line JH (which is obvious), and Point H is on Line JH. Also, there's an angle ∠JAI at point A. So A is on Line GM, and J is on Line JH. So AJ connects A to J, and AI connects A to I. But I is on Line FI. So AI is a line from A to I, which is on FI. So AI might be part of FI extended?

This seems complicated. Let me try to focus on the angles given and see if any of them can be related via the given angle measures.

Given that ∠1 is 123°, which is likely one of the angles listed. Suppose that ∠1 corresponds to one of the given angles. Let's check the possibilities:

Suppose ∠1 is ∠KUQ (at U, between K and Q). If that's the case, then we can look at other angles around point U. For example, since U is on NE and FI, then the lines NE and FI intersect at U, forming vertical angles. So ∠KUQ (between K and Q) would be part of that intersection. Alternatively, if ∠1 is another angle.

Alternatively, suppose ∠1 is ∠GUE. That angle is at U, between G and E. Since G is on GM and E is on NE, so GU and UE form that angle. If that's ∠1, then maybe there are other angles at U that can be related.

Alternatively, maybe ∠1 is ∠NQM. Which is at Q, between N and M. Given that Q is on NE and M is on GM. So NQM is formed by lines NQ (part of NE) and QM (connecting Q to M).

But without knowing which angle is labeled as 1, it's challenging. However, the problem gives us that angle 1 is 123°, and asks for angle 14. So maybe there's a pattern or a relationship between these angles.

Let me consider that some of these angles could be supplementary or complementary due to intersecting lines. For instance, if two lines cross, opposite angles are equal, adjacent angles sum to 180°, etc.

Another thought: since there are several lines intersecting, maybe there are multiple triangles or other polygons where angle relations can be applied. For example, if three lines meet at a point, the sum of angles around that point is 360°, or if two lines intersect, the vertical angles are equal.

Let me check for possible vertical angles. For example, if lines FI and NE intersect at U, then vertical angles would be across from each other. So ∠GUE and ∠... Well, depending on the lines. Suppose that line FI crosses line NE at U. Then the vertical angles at U would be formed by the intersection of FI and NE. So if one angle is formed by FI and NE, then its vertical angle is opposite.

But the angles given at U are ∠GUE (between G and E) and ∠KUQ (between K and Q). So ∠GUE is at U, between G and E. Since E is on NE, and G is on GM. So that angle is between line GU (from U to G) and UE (along NE). Meanwhile, ∠KUQ is at U between K and Q, so lines UK (from U to K) and UQ (along NE). So these angles are adjacent at point U? Or maybe not.

Wait, if we consider the lines:

At point U, we have:

- Line FI passing through U (as per PointLiesOnLine(U, Line(F, I))).
- Line NE passing through U (as per PointLiesOnLine(U, Line(N, E))).

Therefore, the intersection of FI and NE at U creates four angles. Now, the angles at U would be:

- Between FI and NE. So the angles formed by FI and NE intersecting at U.

But the given angles at U are ∠GUE and ∠KUQ. So ∠GUE is between GU (a segment from U to G on GM) and UE (part of NE). ∠KUQ is between UK (segment from U to K on GM) and UQ (part of NE). So these angles are adjacent at U, sharing side UQ or something?

Wait, ∠GUE is between GU and UE. So that's one angle. ∠KUQ is between UK and UQ. Since Q is on NE, UQ is part of NE. So if we think of the lines at U:

- Line FI goes through U, so direction from U to F and U to I.
- Line NE goes through U, so direction from U to N and U to E.

So, the angles at U would involve these directions. But the given angles are ∠GUE and ∠KUQ. These angles involve segments from U to G, U to E, U to K, and U to Q. So G and K are points on Line GM, which passes through U? No, wait, K is on Line GM. Is U on Line GM? From the given predicates, PointLiesOnLine(U, Line(F, I)), so U is on FI. Also, PointLiesOnLine(U, Line(N, E)), so U is on NE. Are U and G on the same line? Not necessarily. Unless Line GM intersects with FI at U? Wait, G is on Line GM, and U is on FI. So unless Line GM and FI intersect at U, but that's not stated. Wait, but earlier, I thought that U is on FI and NE, and K is on Line GM. But there's no mention of Line GM intersecting FI at U. So unless there's an implicit connection.

Wait, but there's a predicate: PointLiesOnLine(U, Line(F, I)). So U is on FI. So FI is a line from F to I, passing through U. Also, Line GM is from G to M, passing through K and A. So unless U is on Line GM? No, unless specified. But there's no predicate stating that. Wait, unless there's an implied intersection. For example, if Line FI and Line GM intersect at some point, but unless told otherwise, we can't assume that.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me try to take a different approach. Let's consider the angles given and see if any of them can be related through the given angle of 123°.

Assume that ∠1 is one of the given angles. For example, if ∠1 is ∠KUQ (at U between K and Q), which is given as 123°. Then, since U is the intersection of FI and NE, the angles formed there would have vertical angles. So if ∠KUQ is 123°, then its vertical angle would also be 123°, and the adjacent angles would be supplementary.

Alternatively, if ∠1 is ∠GUE, then again, depending on the configuration, we can find relationships.

But without knowing which angle is labeled as 1, this is difficult. However, the question says "m∠1 = 123", so angle 1 is one of the given angles. Let me look at the angles again:

List of angles:

1. ∠GUE
2. ∠NQM
3. ∠JAI
4. ∠FKH
5. ∠FJA
6. ∠KUQ

Plus others? Wait, the user said:

"Angle(G, U, E)
Angle(N, Q, M)
Angle(J, A, I)
Angle(F, K, H)
Angle(F, J, A)
Angle(K, U, Q)"

So six angles total. So angle 1 might be one of these six. Assuming that the numbering is sequential, perhaps ∠1 is ∠GUE, ∠2 is ∠NQM, etc., up to ∠6 being ∠KUQ. But the question mentions angle 14, which suggests that there are more than six angles in the figure, possibly formed by intersections or other elements.

Alternatively, maybe the angles are labeled in a specific order, and angle 1 is one of the given ones, while angle 14 is another. Without seeing the diagram, this is speculative. But given that, maybe we can find relationships between these angles.

Let me consider that ∠KUQ is at point U, between K and Q. If that's angle 1, then since U is the intersection of FI and NE, the vertical angle would be opposite, and the adjacent angles would be supplementary. Let's say ∠KUQ is 123°, then the vertical angle would also be 123°, and the other two angles at U would be supplementary to 123°, so 180-123=57°. So maybe angle 14 is one of those supplementary angles, giving 57°, which is option B. But this is assuming that angle 1 is ∠KUQ.

Alternatively, if angle 1 is ∠GUE, which is at U between G and E. If that's 123°, then again, the vertical angle would be 123°, and other angles at U would be supplementary. But again, without knowing which angle is 1, it's hard to tell.

Another possibility: angle 1 is ∠NQM (at Q between N and M). If that's 123°, then maybe there's a triangle involving that angle, allowing us to find other angles.

Alternatively, consider that some of these angles are part of triangles where we can use the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°.

For example, if we consider triangle FJK or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since there are multiple lines intersecting, maybe using the property that the sum of angles around a point is 360°.

Let me try to proceed under the assumption that angle 1 is ∠KUQ, which is 123°, and then find angle 14 as one of the supplementary angles.

So at point U, where lines FI and NE intersect, there are four angles. Let's call them:

- ∠1 (KUQ) = 123°
- Its vertical angle would also be 123°
- The adjacent angles would each be 180 - 123 = 57°

So if angle 14 is one of those adjacent angles, then the answer would be 57°, which is option B.

Alternatively, if angle 1 is one of the other angles, say ∠GUE. Suppose ∠GUE is 123°, then maybe there's a triangle involving that angle, leading to other angles.

Alternatively, if angle 1 is ∠FJA (at J between F and A). Let's say ∠FJA is 123°, then maybe there's a triangle involving that angle, and using the triangle angle sum to find other angles.

But without knowing which angle is 1, this is guesswork. However, given that angle 14 is requested, and the options include 57°, which is 180-123, it's plausible that angle 14 is the supplement of angle 1.

Thus, assuming that angle 1 is 123°, and angle 14 is its supplement, the answer would be 57°, which is option B.

Alternatively, if angle 1 is an obtuse angle, and angle 14 is acute, making it 57°, which fits.

Considering that, I think the intended answer is B.
