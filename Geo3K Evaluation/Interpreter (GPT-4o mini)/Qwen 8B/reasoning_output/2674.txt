Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the points and the given elements.

We have points A, B, C, D, E, F. There's a circle defined as Circle(D, F, E), so that means the circle has center at one of these points? Wait, usually a circle is defined by its center and radius, but here it's written as Circle(D, F, E). Maybe that's a typo or maybe it's indicating three points on the circle? Or perhaps D is the center, and F and E are points on the circle? Hmm, the notation might vary depending on the system. But since there's also Arc(A,B) and other arcs mentioned, maybe we need to consider the circle's properties.

Then there are various arcs: Arc(A,B), Arc(D,A), Arc(B,C), Arc(C,F), Arc(E,D). Also, lines like Line(A,B), Line(C,D), Line(E,F), Line(B,F), Line(A,D). Angles mentioned are Angle(A,D,F) which is 50 degrees, and RightAngle(Angle(C,F,E)). So, angle at point F between C and E is a right angle.

The question asks for the measure of arc ACE, denoted as m∠ACE? Wait, no—the notation m∠ACE would typically mean the measure of angle ACE, but the question says m widehat ACE, which is an arc. Wait, the question says "Find m ∠ ACE" but the original problem mentions "m ∠ DFA = 50" and "CF ⊥ FB". Wait, the actual question is about m∠ACE? Wait, no, looking back: the user wrote "Find m widehat ACE." So that's the measure of arc ACE. So the arc from A to C to E, passing through those points?

But first, let's clarify all given data. Let me try to sketch mentally.

First, points: A, B, C, D, E, F. 

Circle(D,F,E): This could imply that D is the center, and F and E are points on the circle? Because if you define a circle with center D and radius DF, then E is another point on the circle. Alternatively, maybe it's a circle passing through points D, F, E? That would make sense if they're not colinear. But in that case, the circle would have three points, so D, F, E are on the same circle. However, the way it's written, Circle(D,F,E), might indicate that D is the center, and F and E are radii? Not sure. Let me think again.

Alternatively, in some contexts, a circle can be defined by three points. For example, if D, F, E are not colinear, then they lie on a unique circle. But then the circle is determined by those three points. However, the presence of arcs like Arc(D,A) suggests that D is a point on the circle? Or maybe D is the center. Let me check other predicates.

Arc(A,B), Arc(D,A), Arc(B,C), Arc(C,F), Arc(E,D). These arcs suggest that certain points are on the circle. For instance, Arc(A,B) implies that A and B are endpoints of an arc, so they are on the circle. Similarly, Arc(D,A) would mean D and A are on the circle. Wait, but if Arc(D,A) is part of the circle, then D and A are points on the circle. Similarly, Arc(B,C) implies B and C are on the circle, Arc(C,F) implies C and F are on the circle, Arc(E,D) implies E and D are on the circle. So, putting this together, points A, B, C, D, E, F are all on the circle? Wait, but the circle was defined as Circle(D,F,E)—if that's the case, then D, F, E are on the circle. But if A, B, C are also on the circle via the arcs, then all six points are on the same circle. But then why is the circle called Circle(D,F,E)? Maybe that's just specifying the circle through three points D, F, E, implying that the circle passes through them. Therefore, all points A, B, C, D, E, F lie on the same circle centered at... Well, if D is the center, then F and E are points on the circle. But then A, B, C, D would be points on the circle? Wait, that doesn't fit unless D is both the center and on the circle, which isn't possible unless the radius is zero. So that seems conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the circle is defined by three points D, F, E. So the circle passes through D, F, E. Then, points A, B, C, D, E, F are all on this circle. Because Arc(D,A) implies that D and A are on the circle. So yes, that makes sense. So the circle passes through D, F, E, and other points A, B, C. So all points A, B, C, D, E, F are on the same circle. Therefore, it's a circle with points D, F, E, A, B, C on it.

Now, the lines: Line(A,B), Line(C,D), Line(E,F), Line(B,F), Line(A,D). So these lines connect pairs of points. Also, angles: Angle(A,D,F) is 50 degrees, and RightAngle(Angle(C,F,E))—so angle at F between C and E is a right angle.

Let me try to visualize. Since all points are on the circle, we can use circle theorems. The angle at D, between A and F is 50 degrees. That angle is likely an inscribed angle or a central angle. Let me check.

Angle(A,D,F) refers to the angle at point D, formed by points A, D, F. So vertex at D, with segments DA and DF. Now, since D is on the circle, and A and F are also on the circle. So DA and DF are two chords of the circle meeting at D. The measure of this angle depends on whether it's an inscribed angle or something else.

Wait, the angle at D: if D is on the circumference, then the angle between two chords DA and DF would be an inscribed angle. But inscribed angles subtend arcs. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the subtended arc. So angle at D, between A and F, would correspond to the arc AF. Wait, but the angle is at D, so the arc opposite to the angle would be arc AF. Wait, the formula is that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So if angle ADF is 50 degrees, then the arc AF would be 100 degrees. Wait, because the inscribed angle is half the arc. So arc AF is 100 degrees.

But wait, is angle ADF an inscribed angle? Let me confirm. If D is on the circle, then yes. Points A, D, F are all on the circle, so angle at D would intercept arc AF. Thus, the measure of angle ADF is half of arc AF. Hence, arc AF is 100 degrees.

Also, given that CF is perpendicular to FB. So angle CFE is a right angle. Wait, the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(C,F,E)), which is angle at F between C and E. So angle CFE is 90 degrees. Since points C, F, E are on the circle, then angle CFE is an inscribed angle. Wait, but if F is on the circle, then angle CFE would be an inscribed angle intercepting arc CE. The measure of angle CFE is half the measure of arc CE. Since angle CFE is 90 degrees, arc CE would be 180 degrees. So arc CE is a semicircle, meaning that points C and E are diametrically opposite on the circle. Therefore, CE is a diameter.

So, arc CE is 180 degrees. Which also implies that the length of CE is twice the radius of the circle. But since CE is a diameter, that makes sense.

Now, the problem asks for the measure of arc ACE. Wait, arc ACE would be the arc from A to C to E. Wait, but in terms of arcs, if we go from A to C to E along the circumference. Depending on the direction, it could be major or minor arc. But since the total circle is 360 degrees, we need to find the sum of arcs AC and CE. Wait, but arc CE is already 180 degrees. So arc ACE would be arc AC plus arc CE. But need to confirm the path. Alternatively, maybe it's the arc from A to E passing through C. So that would be arc ACE, which is arc AC + arc CE. But since arc CE is 180 degrees, we need to find arc AC.

Alternatively, perhaps the arc ACE is the entire arc from A to E passing through C, which would be arc AC + arc CE. So if we can find arc AC, then adding arc CE (which is 180 degrees) gives us the measure of arc ACE.

Earlier, we found that arc AF is 100 degrees. Let me see. How does that relate to other arcs?

Since points A, D, F are on the circle, and angle at D is 50 degrees, leading to arc AF being 100 degrees.

Additionally, we know that CE is a diameter (arc CE = 180 degrees). Also, we have other arcs. For example, arc CD? Let me think.

We need to find arc ACE. Let me try to find the measure of arc AC. Let me note that arc AF is 100 degrees. Also, considering other arcs. Let's look for relations between the arcs.

Another thing to note: since CF is perpendicular to FB, which implies that angle CFE is 90 degrees, and that CE is a diameter. Also, point B is connected via line BF. Let me think about where point B is located.

Looking at the arcs: Arc(B,C) is present, which suggests that points B and C are endpoints of an arc. Also, Line(B,F) connects B and F. So point B is connected to F. Given that angle CFE is 90 degrees, and CE is a diameter, then point F lies somewhere such that CF is perpendicular to FE. Wait, angle at F between C and E is 90 degrees. Since CE is a diameter, then according to Thales' theorem, any point on the circle forming a triangle with diameter CE would result in a right angle. So point F is on the circle, and angle CFE is 90 degrees, confirming that CE is indeed a diameter.

Therefore, CE is a diameter. So arc CE is 180 degrees. So points C and E are endpoints of a diameter.

Now, the goal is to find arc ACE. Let me consider the arc from A to E passing through C. So that would be arc AC + arc CE. We know arc CE is 180 degrees. So we need to find arc AC.

How do we find arc AC? Let's recall that angle ADF is 50 degrees, which corresponds to arc AF being 100 degrees. Let me see if we can find other arcs.

We also have arc AF = 100 degrees. Let me try to find other arcs. For example, since arc CE is 180 degrees, and we have points D, F, E on the circle. Let me think about the position of D. Since there's an arc from D to A (Arc(D,A)), which suggests that D and A are endpoints of an arc. Also, there's Line(A,D), so points A and D are connected by a straight line, which is a chord of the circle.

Moreover, there's an arc from D to A, so that arc could be part of the circle. Also, there's an arc from B to C (Arc(B,C)), and arc from C to F (Arc(C,F)), and arc from E to D (Arc(E,D)).

Perhaps we can use the fact that the sum of arcs around the circle is 360 degrees. Let me attempt to compute the measures of different arcs.

Starting with arc AF = 100 degrees. Also, arc CE = 180 degrees. What about other arcs?

Let me consider the arcs involving point D. Since there's an arc from D to A (Arc(D,A)), and arc from E to D (Arc(E,D)), which suggests that arc ED is part of the circle. Also, since CE is a diameter, and E is one endpoint of the diameter, and D is another point on the circle.

Wait, since CE is a diameter, then the center of the circle is the midpoint of CE. Let me denote O as the center. But since we don't have explicit mention of the center, but given that the circle is defined by points D, F, E, maybe D is not the center. Wait, earlier confusion arises from how the circle is defined. But assuming that all points A, B, C, D, E, F are on the circle, and CE is a diameter.

Now, trying to find arc AC. Let me think about other arcs. For example, arc AF is 100 degrees. Let me see if there's a relation between arc AF and other arcs.

Point D is on the circle, and there's an arc from D to A (Arc(D,A)). Suppose that arc DA is x degrees. Then, since arc AF is 100 degrees, and if we can find other arcs adjacent to these.

Also, there's an arc from C to F (Arc(C,F)), which suggests that arc CF is y degrees. And arc from E to D (Arc(E,D)) is z degrees. Since the entire circle is 360 degrees, the sum of all arcs should add up to 360.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's challenging. Let me try to find relationships between the arcs.

Given that angle at D (ADF) is 50 degrees, which relates to arc AF (100 degrees). Also, since CE is a diameter, arc CE is 180 degrees.

Let me consider the positions of points. Suppose we have the circle with diameter CE. Points A, B, D, F are on the circle. Let me imagine placing point C at the left end of the diameter, E at the right end. Then, point D is somewhere on the circle, and F is another point.

Since arc AF is 100 degrees, starting from A to F. Let me assume that moving clockwise from A to F covers 100 degrees. Also, since CE is a diameter, and there's an arc from E to D (Arc(E,D)), so arc ED is some measure. Also, there's an arc from D to A (Arc(D,A)), which would be another measure.

But I need more connections. Let me think about the line connecting A and D (Line(A,D)), which is a chord. Also, there's a line from B to F (Line(B,F)), and line from C to D (Line(C,D)).

Also, angle at F between C and E is 90 degrees. Since CE is a diameter, then F lies on the circle such that angle CFE is 90 degrees. As per Thales' theorem, any point on the circle forms a right angle with the diameter. So that confirms that CE is a diameter.

Now, let me consider point F. It's on the circle, and angle CFE is 90 degrees. Also, there's an arc from C to F (Arc(C,F)), which would be some measure. Let me denote arc CF as w degrees. Since CE is 180 degrees, and arc CF is part of that, then arc FE would be 180 - w degrees. But I'm not sure yet.

Also, there's an arc from E to D (Arc(E,D)), which we can call z degrees. And arc from D to A (Arc(D,A)) is x degrees. Then, arc AF is 100 degrees. Let me see how these relate.

Assuming that the circle is divided into arcs: from A to D (x), D to E (z), E to C (since CE is diameter?), wait, no. Wait, CE is a diameter, so from C to E is 180 degrees. But the points may not be arranged sequentially as A-D-E-C-F... It's getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe we can find arc AC by considering other angles or arcs. Let me think about triangle DAF. Since angle at D is 50 degrees, and if we can find other angles or sides.

Wait, but since all points are on the circle, maybe we can use other circle theorems. For example, if we can find the measure of arc AC, then adding arc CE (180 degrees) would give us arc ACE.

Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between arc AF (100 degrees) and arc AC. Let me see.

Suppose that arc AF is 100 degrees. Let me think about the position of point D. There's an arc from D to A (Arc(D,A)), which could be part of the circle. Also, there's a line from D to A (Line(A,D)), which is a chord. Also, there's a line from A to B (Line(A,B)), and arc from B to C (Arc(B,C)), and line from C to D (Line(C,D)).

This is quite interconnected. Perhaps I need to find relationships between arcs using the given angles and lines.

Let me try to focus on the arcs related to angle ADF = 50 degrees. As previously established, arc AF is 100 degrees. Now, since points A, D, F are on the circle, and angle at D is 50 degrees, which is an inscribed angle over arc AF. 

Now, since CE is a diameter, and F is another point on the circle. Let me consider the arc from F to E. Since arc CE is 180 degrees, and arc from F to E would depend on where F is located. If I can find the measure of arc FE, then I can relate it to other arcs.

But how?

Alternatively, since there's a line from B to F (Line(B,F)), and an arc from B to C (Arc(B,C)), which suggests that points B and C are connected by an arc. Also, line from C to D (Line(C,D)).

Maybe there's a triangle involved here. For example, triangle CFD? Or triangle CFB?

Since CF is perpendicular to FB, as given by the RightAngle(Angle(C,F,E))? Wait, no. The RightAngle is at F between C and E, so angle CFE is 90 degrees. So that tells us that CF is perpendicular to FE. So line CF is perpendicular to line FE. Since FE is part of the diameter CE, and CF is perpendicular to FE, then CF is tangent to the circle at F? No, because CF is a chord, not a tangent. Wait, but if CF is perpendicular to FE, which is part of the diameter CE, then that implies that CF is perpendicular to the diameter CE at point F. Which would mean that CF is tangent to the circle at F? Wait, no, because if a line is perpendicular to a radius at the point of contact, it's a tangent. Here, FE is a diameter, so the radius at F would be from the center to F. But since CE is a diameter, the center is the midpoint of CE. So if CF is perpendicular to FE at F, then CF is perpendicular to the radius at F, making CF a tangent. But since F is on the circle, CF cannot be a tangent—it's a chord. Contradiction. Wait, this suggests a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, angle CFE is 90 degrees, which is an inscribed angle. Earlier, we said that this implies arc CE is 180 degrees. But if angle CFE is 90 degrees, then it's an inscribed angle subtending arc CE. Therefore, arc CE is 180 degrees. So that confirms that CE is a diameter. Now, since CF is a chord from C to F, and FE is a chord from F to E, and angle between them is 90 degrees. So triangle CFE is a right-angled triangle at F. Therefore, CF² + FE² = CE². But since CE is the diameter, and F is on the circle, then CF and FE are chords. However, since CE is a diameter, and F is on the circle, FE is a segment from F to E, which is a chord. But how does this help us?

Alternatively, since CE is a diameter, the center O is the midpoint of CE. Let me denote O as the center. Then, the coordinates might help, but since we don't have coordinate systems, maybe we can use vector approaches or other methods. But maybe not necessary.

Back to finding arc AC. Let me think about the arcs that involve point A. We know arc AF is 100 degrees. If I can find the measure of arc AD, then perhaps I can find arc AC.

There's an arc from D to A (Arc(D,A)), which we can denote as arc DA. Let me call arc DA = x degrees. Then, since the circle is 360 degrees, the rest of the arcs can be expressed in terms of x and other variables.

But we need more equations. Let me think about other arcs. For example, there's an arc from B to C (Arc(B,C)), and line from B to F (Line(B,F)). Also, there's an arc from C to F (Arc(C,F)), which we can denote as arc CF = y degrees. Then, since arc CE is 180 degrees, arc from C to E is 180 degrees. If arc CF is y degrees, then arc FE would be 180 - y degrees.

Similarly, there's an arc from E to D (Arc(E,D)), which we can denote as arc ED = z degrees. Then, since the circle goes from E to D to ... ?

Also, there's an arc from D to A (arc DA = x), and arc AF = 100 degrees. So from A to F is 100 degrees. Then, if we can express other arcs in terms of x, y, z, and set up equations.

Let me try to write down the total circle:

Total circumference (sum of arcs) = 360 degrees.

So, arc AB + arc BC + arc CD + arc DE + arc EF + arc FA = 360 degrees. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact order of the points on the circle. It's hard to tell without a diagram.

Alternatively, since we have several arcs mentioned:

Arc(A,B), Arc(D,A), Arc(B,C), Arc(C,F), Arc(E,D), and others. Let me list all arcs:

From the given Arc predicates:

Arc(A,B): arc AB
Arc(D,A): arc DA
Arc(B,C): arc BC
Arc(C,F): arc CF
Arc(E,D): arc ED
Arc(A,B), Arc(D,A), Arc(B,C), Arc(C,F), Arc(E,D).

But there are also other arcs implied by the lines and angles. For example, arc AF is mentioned in the angle at D. So arc AF is 100 degrees.

Let me try to think about the arcs in terms of the circle.

Assume that the points are arranged in the order A -> B -> C -> F -> E -> D -> A, forming the circle. But this is just a guess. Alternatively, they could be arranged differently. Without knowing the exact positions, it's tricky, but maybe we can deduce based on the given information.

Let me consider arc AF = 100 degrees. If arc AF is 100 degrees, then depending on the position of A and F, this could help.

Also, since CE is a diameter (arc CE = 180 degrees), and arc CF is part of that. Let me say that arc CF is y degrees, and arc FE is 180 - y degrees.

Now, let's try to find relationships between arcs.

We have arc DA = x degrees, arc ED = z degrees. So from D to E is z degrees, and from E to D is z degrees? Wait, arc ED is the arc from E to D, which would be the same as arc DE, but going the other way around the circle. Assuming the arcs are taken in the positive direction, but this requires knowing the order.

Alternatively, since arc ED is mentioned, it's likely that the arc from E to D is z degrees, so from E to D is z degrees, and from D to E would be 360 - z degrees.

But this is too vague. Let me think differently.

Since angle at D (ADF) is 50 degrees, which corresponds to arc AF = 100 degrees. Also, since arc AF is 100 degrees, and we need to find arc AC.

Let me suppose that arc AC is what we need. To find arc AC, maybe we can find other arcs that relate to it.

For example, if we can find arc AD and arc DC, then arc AC = arc AD + arc DC, or arc AC = arc AD - arc DC, depending on the direction.

But how to find arc AD or arc DC?

Alternatively, since there's an arc from D to A (arc DA), and we know arc AF is 100 degrees. Let me imagine that from point A, moving along the circle to F, which is 100 degrees. If we can relate arc DA to this.

Also, there's an arc from D to A (arc DA), which we can denote as x degrees. Then, if we can find other arcs involving D, we can relate them.

Additionally, there's an arc from E to D (arc ED), which we can denote as z degrees. And arc from C to F (arc CF), which is y degrees.

Let me try to build equations:

Total circumference: arc AB + arc BC + arc CD + arc DE + arc EF + arc FA = 360 degrees.

But I don't know arc AB, arc BC, arc CD, arc DE, arc EF, arc FA. However, we know arc FA = 100 degrees, and arc CE = 180 degrees (arc CE is from C to E, which includes arc CF + arc FE = y + (180 - y) = 180 degrees).

But I need more constraints. Let me think about other information.

We have line from C to D (Line(C,D)), which is a chord. Also, line from B to F (Line(B,F)), and line from A to D (Line(A,D)).

Also, there's an arc from B to C (Arc(B,C)), which suggests that arc BC is part of the circle. Let me denote arc BC = p degrees.

Also, there's an arc from C to F (Arc(C,F)) = y degrees.

And arc from E to D (Arc(E,D)) = z degrees.

Also, arc from D to A (Arc(D,A)) = x degrees.

Now, we can try to express other arcs in terms of these variables.

For example, arc AB: since there's an arc from A to B (Arc(A,B)), which we can denote as q degrees.

So, arc AB = q, arc BC = p, arc CD = ?, arc DE = z, arc EF = 180 - y, arc FA = 100.

But arc CD is from C to D. How can we express arc CD?

Well, if we move from C to D, it would pass through some arcs. For example, from C to D could be arc CD directly, or it could be arc CB + arc BA + arc AD, depending on the circle's layout. This is getting too ambiguous.

Alternatively, since there's a line from C to D (Line(C,D)), which is a chord. Let me think about triangle CDE or something. Wait, but I don't know much about that.

Wait, since we have arc CE = 180 degrees, and arc CF = y degrees, and arc FE = 180 - y degrees. Also, arc CD is part of the circle. If I can relate arc CD to other arcs.

But I'm stuck here. Let me think of another approach.

We know that angle ADF is 50 degrees, which is an inscribed angle over arc AF (100 degrees). Also, since CF is perpendicular to FB, and angle CFE is 90 degrees, which we've used to establish arc CE is 180 degrees.

Now, since arc CE is 180 degrees, and we need to find arc ACE, which is from A to E through C. So arc ACE = arc AC + arc CE = arc AC + 180 degrees.

Thus, if we can find arc AC, we can add 180 degrees to get the answer.

To find arc AC, let's consider other arcs. For example, if we can find arc AF (100 degrees) and arc FD, then arc AD = arc AF + arc FD? Or depending on the direction.

Wait, arc AF is 100 degrees. Let me consider point D. There's an arc from D to A (arc DA), which we can call x degrees. Also, there's a line from D to A (Line(A,D)), which is a chord. Also, there's an arc from D to A (Arc(D,A)).

If I can find the measure of arc DA, then maybe I can relate it to other arcs.

Let me think about triangle ADF. In this triangle, we know angle at D is 50 degrees. If I can find other angles or sides.

But since all points are on the circle, maybe using the Law of Sines or Cosines on the triangle. However, without knowing side lengths, this might not help directly.

Alternatively, since angle at D is 50 degrees, and points A, D, F are on the circle, we can use the property that the angle at D is half the measure of arc AF, which we already used to get arc AF = 100 degrees.

Now, let me consider point F. Since angle CFE is 90 degrees, and CE is a diameter, then F lies somewhere on the circle such that CF is perpendicular to FE. This implies that F is positioned such that when you draw CF and FE, they form a right angle at F.

Since CE is a diameter, and F is on the circle, then FE is a chord from F to E, and CF is a chord from C to F. The right angle at F suggests that CF is perpendicular to FE. So, in triangle CFE, right-angled at F.

Now, in this right-angled triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem: CF² + FE² = CE². But since CE is the diameter, let's denote its length as 2r, where r is the radius. Then, CF and FE are chords of the circle. But without knowing the radius or specific lengths, this might not help directly.

However, since we're dealing with arcs, maybe we can relate the lengths of these chords to their corresponding arcs.

For example, the length of chord CF is 2r sin(θ/2), where θ is the measure of arc CF. Similarly, FE would be 2r sin(arc FE / 2). But since CF ⊥ FE, we have CF² + FE² = (2r)^2.

But this seems complex without knowing the radius or specific values. However, perhaps we can relate the arcs.

Let me denote arc CF as y degrees, and arc FE as (180 - y) degrees, since arc CE is 180 degrees. Then:

Length of CF = 2r sin(y/2)
Length of FE = 2r sin((180 - y)/2) = 2r sin(90 - y/2) = 2r cos(y/2)

Then, CF² + FE² = (2r)^2

Substituting:

[2r sin(y/2)]^2 + [2r cos(y/2)]^2 = 4r²
=> 4r² [sin²(y/2) + cos²(y/2)] = 4r²
Which simplifies to 4r² = 4r², which is always true. So this doesn't provide new information. Hence, this approach doesn't help.

Alternative idea: Since arc CE is 180 degrees, and we need to find arc AC. Let me consider other arcs involving point A.

We know arc AF is 100 degrees. Let me try to find the measure of arc AD, which is part of the circle. If I can find arc AD, then maybe I can find arc AC by relating it to other arcs.

But how?

Let me consider the line from A to D (Line(A,D)), which is a chord. Also, there's an arc from D to A (Arc(D,A)), which we can call x degrees. Also, there's an arc from A to B (Arc(A,B)), which we can call q degrees, and arc from B to C (Arc(B,C)) = p degrees.

If I can find x, q, p, etc., in terms of known quantities.

But I still lack enough information.

Wait, maybe we can use the fact that there's a right angle at F between C and E, and line from B to F. Let me consider triangle BFC or something.

But I don't have much info about point B. Let me think about the arcs involving B.

There's an arc from B to C (Arc(B,C)), and a line from B to F (Line(B,F)). Also, there's an arc from A to B (Arc(A,B)).

If I can relate these arcs to other parts.

Let me assume that arc AB is q degrees, arc BC is p degrees, arc CD is r degrees, arc DE is s degrees, arc EF is t degrees, and arc FA is 100 degrees. Total: q + p + r + s + t + 100 = 360.

Also, since arc CE is 180 degrees, which is arc CF + arc FE = y + t = 180 degrees. Wait, arc CF is from C to F, which would be arc CB + arc BF? Or depends on the direction.

This is getting too tangled. Let me try to focus on what we need: arc AC.

If I can find arc AC, then adding arc CE (180 degrees) gives arc ACE.

To find arc AC, let's think: from A to C, passing through B or D or other points. 

If I can find arc AC by subtracting other arcs.

For example, arc AC = arc AB + arc BC = q + p.

But I don't know q or p.

Alternatively, if there's a relationship between arc AC and other known arcs.

Wait, since there's an arc from D to A (arc DA = x degrees), and arc from A to F is 100 degrees. If I can find the relationship between arc DA and arc AF.

Imagine that from A, moving along the circle to D is x degrees, and from A to F is 100 degrees. If points D and F are on opposite sides of A, then x + 100 = 360 - other arcs. But without knowing the exact positions, it's difficult.

Alternatively, since arc AF is 100 degrees, and there's a line from D to A, and point D is on the circle. If I can find the measure of arc AD, which is x degrees, then maybe I can relate it to other arcs.

Let me consider the angle at A. Are there any angles given at A? Not directly, except for angle DFA, which is at D.

Wait, but there's a line from A to D and from A to B. Maybe triangle ABD or something.

Alternatively, since we have arc AF = 100 degrees, and arc CE = 180 degrees, and needing to find arc AC, perhaps there's a way to relate these through other arcs.

Wait, if I consider the entire circle, and knowing that arc CE is 180 degrees, and arc AF is 100 degrees, and if I can find the remaining arcs.

But I'm stuck here. Let me try a different approach.

Since arc AF is 100 degrees, and arc CE is 180 degrees, let's consider the entire circle. The sum of all arcs is 360 degrees. So if we can find the measures of other arcs, we can find the missing ones.

Let me think about the arcs involving point F. From F, we have arc FE (part of arc CE, which is 180 degrees), and arc FA = 100 degrees. Also, there's an arc from F to D? Or other points.

Wait, there's an arc from F to D? Not explicitly stated, but if there's a line from F to D (since there's Line(B,F) and Line(C,D), but not sure.

Wait, the given predicates include Arc(E,D), Arc(D,A), Arc(A,B), Arc(B,C), Arc(C,F), Arc(D,A), Arc(A,B), Arc(B,C), Arc(C,F), Arc(E,D). So, arc from E to D is present, arc from D to A, arc from A to B, arc from B to C, arc from C to F.

So, if I follow the order of points as A → B → C → F → E → D → A, forming the circle. Let me assume this ordering for simplicity.

Under this assumption, the arcs would be:

- Arc AB: from A to B
- Arc BC: from B to C
- Arc CF: from C to F
- Arc FE: from F to E (part of the diameter CE)
- Arc ED: from E to D
- Arc DA: from D to A

With this arrangement, the total circle is arc AB + arc BC + arc CF + arc FE + arc ED + arc DA = 360 degrees.

We know arc CF + arc FE = arc CE = 180 degrees.

Also, arc AF is the arc from A to F, which would be arc AB + arc BC + arc CF = arc AB + arc BC + arc CF = 100 degrees.

Also, arc DA is from D to A, which would be arc ED + arc DA? Wait, under this ordering, arc DA is from D to A, which would go through the arc from D to A directly, or it could be the rest of the circle. Wait, if the circle is ordered A → B → C → F → E → D → A, then arc DA would be the arc from D to A going the long way around the circle, or the short way. But since arc DA is mentioned as an arc, it's likely the shorter arc.

But without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to say. Let me proceed with this assumed order.

Under this ordering:

arc AF = arc AB + arc BC + arc CF = 100 degrees.

Also, arc CE = arc CF + arc FE = 180 degrees.

Let me denote:

Let arc AB = a,

arc BC = b,

arc CF = c,

arc FE = d,

arc ED = e,

arc DA = f.

So, we have:

a + b + c = 100 degrees (from arc AF),

c + d = 180 degrees (arc CE),

and the total circle:

a + b + c + d + e + f = 360 degrees.

Also, since arc ED is e, and arc DA is f, which is the arc from D to A. Under our assumed ordering, arc DA would be the arc from D to A, which would be the arc passing through E, F, C, B, A? No, because in the assumed order, from D to A would be the arc going through E, F, C, B, A? Or the other way? Depends on the direction.

Actually, if the circle is ordered A → B → C → F → E → D → A, then the arc from D to A would be the arc going through E, F, C, B, A? Or the arc going the other way? It depends on which arc is considered. Since arc DA is mentioned as a separate arc, it's likely the smaller arc.

But without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to determine. However, let's assume that arc DA is the arc from D to A passing through E, F, C, B, which would be arc ED + arc DF + arc FC + arc CB + arc BA? No, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, since arc DA is mentioned, and arc ED is mentioned, and arc DA is part of the circle, perhaps arc DA is the arc from D to A directly, not passing through E. So, in this case, under the assumed ordering, arc DA would be the arc from D to A going the other way around the circle, which would be arc DE + arc EF + arc FC + arc CB + arc BA? No, that's too long.

This approach is not working. Let me try to find another way.

Since arc AF is 100 degrees, and arc CE is 180 degrees, and we need to find arc AC.

If I can find the measure of arc AC, which is arc AB + arc BC (assuming the arc from A to C passes through B).

Let me denote arc AB = a, arc BC = b, so arc AC = a + b.

From earlier, arc AF = a + b + c = 100 degrees, where c is arc CF.

Also, arc CE = c + d = 180 degrees, where d is arc FE.

Now, we need more equations to solve for a + b.

Let me consider other arcs. For example, arc ED = e, arc DA = f.

Total circle: a + b + c + d + e + f = 360.

But we have two equations:

1. a + b + c = 100

2. c + d = 180

And total: a + b + c + d + e + f = 360.

Subtracting equation 1 and 2 from the total:

(a + b + c + d) + e + f = 360

From equation 1: a + b + c = 100

From equation 2: c + d = 180 => d = 180 - c

So substituting into total:

(100 + d) + e + f = 360 => 100 + (180 - c) + e + f = 360 => 280 - c + e + f = 360 => e + f = 80 + c.

But we don't know e or f.

However, there's also the arc from E to D (e), and arc from D to A (f). If I can relate e and f to other arcs.

But without more information, it's hard to proceed.

Let me think about the arc DA (f). Since there's an arc from D to A (arc DA), and arc from E to D (arc ED = e). If I consider the arc from D to A, it could be either e + arc from E to A, or something else. But this is unclear.

Alternatively, since arc DA is part of the circle, and arc ED is part of the circle, perhaps arc DA = arc DE + arc EA? Not necessarily.

At this point, I realize I'm stuck without more information. Let me try to think of another angle.

Since angle CFE is 90 degrees, and CE is a diameter, then F lies on the circle such that CF is perpendicular to FE. This means that F is the point where the perpendicular from C meets the circle. But since CE is a diameter, and F is on the circle, this implies that F is the foot of the perpendicular from C to the diameter CE. Wait, no. If CF is perpendicular to FE, and FE is part of the diameter CE, then F is the point on the circle such that CF is perpendicular to CE at F. Wait, but CE is a diameter, so the center is the midpoint of CE. Let me denote M as the midpoint of CE, which is the center.

If CF is perpendicular to FE, then CF is perpendicular to the diameter CE at F. This implies that CF is tangent to the circle at F, because a tangent at F is perpendicular to the radius. But CF is a chord, not a tangent, so this is a contradiction unless F is the point where the tangent meets the circle. But since F is on the circle, this would mean that CF is the tangent at F, which would imply that CF is perpendicular to the radius at F. But the radius at F is FM, where M is the center. So, if CF is perpendicular to FM, then CF is the tangent at F. But since F is on the circle, CF is a chord, not a tangent. This suggests that my previous conclusion that CE is a diameter is incorrect, or there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, this indicates a contradiction. Let me re-examine the earlier conclusion about arc CE being 180 degrees. The angle CFE is 90 degrees, which is an inscribed angle subtending arc CE. According to the inscribed angle theorem, the measure of the inscribed angle is half the measure of its subtended arc. So if angle CFE is 90 degrees, then arc CE is 180 degrees, making it a semicircle. This is correct.

But if CE is a diameter, then the center is the midpoint of CE. If CF is perpendicular to FE, then CF is perpendicular to the diameter CE at point F. This would imply that CF is tangent to the circle at F, but since F is on the circle, this would require that CF is a tangent, which contradicts it being a chord. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my assumptions.

Wait, but angle CFE is at F, between C and E. So, it's not the angle between CF and the diameter CE, but between CF and FE. Since FE is a chord from F to E, and CF is a chord from C to F. So,
