<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points X, M, N, Z, Y, and some predicates about them. The question asks for XY given XM=4, XN=6, NZ=9. Let me start by breaking down the given information step by step.

First, looking at the predicates. There are several Triangle predicates: Triangle(X,N,Z) and Triangle(M,N,Y). Also, there are RightAngle predicates for Angle(M,X,N) and Angle(N,Z,Y). Then there are PointLiesOnLine statements indicating that M lies on Line(X,Y), N lies on Line(X,Z), and N also lies on Line(Y,Z). 

So, visualizing this, maybe I should draw a diagram. Let me sketch mentally. Points X, N, Z form a triangle since Triangle(X,N,Z). Similarly, points M, N, Y form another triangle. The right angles are at Angle(M,X,N) and Angle(N,Z,Y). That suggests that in triangle MXN, the angle at X is a right angle? Wait, the Angle(M,X,N) would mean the angle at point X between points M and N. Wait, no—the syntax is Angle(A,B,C) usually means the angle at point B between points A and C. So Angle(M,X,N) is the angle at X between M and N. But since it's a right angle, that implies that MX is perpendicular to NX. Similarly, Angle(N,Z,Y) is the angle at Z between N and Y, so NZ is perpendicular to ZY.

Also, the PointLiesOnLine predicates: M lies on Line(X,Y), so M is somewhere along the line connecting X and Y. N lies on Line(X,Z), so N is on the line from X to Z. Additionally, N lies on Line(Y,Z), which means that N is the intersection point of lines XZ and YZ? Wait, if N is on both XZ and YZ, then N is the intersection of those two lines. Therefore, points X, Z, Y, and N are arranged such that N is connected to both X and Z, and also to Y. Hmm, but how do these lines connect?

Let me try to map this out. Since N is on Line(X,Z), that means X---N---Z or X---Z with N somewhere on that line. Also, N is on Line(Y,Z), so Y---N---Z or Y---Z with N on that line. Wait, but if N is on both Line(X,Z) and Line(Y,Z), then Z is a common point. So, points X, Z, and Y are connected via N. Maybe forming a triangle XYZ with N being a point on XZ and YZ? Or perhaps forming a quadrilateral?

Wait, the triangles mentioned are Triangle(X,N,Z) and Triangle(M,N,Y). So Triangle(X,N,Z) has vertices X, N, Z. Triangle(M,N,Y) has vertices M, N, Y. Given that, and the right angles at Angle(M,X,N) and Angle(N,Z,Y).

Since Angle(M,X,N) is a right angle, that means triangle MXN is a right triangle with the right angle at X. Because the angle at X between M and N is 90 degrees. Similarly, Angle(N,Z,Y) is a right angle, so triangle NZY is a right triangle with the right angle at Z.

Now, considering the coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to the points could help. Let me try coordinate geometry here.

Let’s assume point X is at the origin (0,0) to simplify calculations. Since XM=4 and XN=6, and the right angle at X for triangle MXN. If X is at (0,0), then since the right angle is at X, points M and N would lie along axes. For example, suppose XM is along the x-axis and XN along the y-axis. So, point M would be at (a, 0) and N at (0, b). But given that XM=4, so distance from X(0,0) to M(a,0) is |a|=4, so a=4 or -4. Similarly, XN=6, so N would be at (0,6) or (0,-6). Let me take positive directions for simplicity: M(4,0), N(0,6).

But wait, the PointLiesOnLine(M, Line(X,Y)) says that M lies on the line XY. So, if X is at (0,0) and M is at (4,0), then line XY passes through M. Therefore, Y must be somewhere on the same line as X and M. Wait, but line XY goes through X and Y. Since M is on line XY, then line XY is the same as line XM. Wait, but if X is (0,0) and M is (4,0), then line XY is the x-axis. Therefore, Y must be another point on the x-axis. But then where is Y located? Also, N is on Line(X,Z) and Line(Y,Z). Let's see.

Point N is at (0,6). It lies on Line(X,Z), so X is (0,0), so Line(X,Z) connects (0,0) to Z. Since N(0,6) is on that line, then Z must be along the y-axis. So, Z is somewhere on the y-axis. Let me denote Z as (0,c) because it's on the line XZ which is the y-axis. Also, N lies on Line(Y,Z). So, Line(Y,Z) connects Y and Z. Since Y is on the x-axis (because line XY is x-axis), and Z is on y-axis (since N is on XZ), then Line(Y,Z) connects Y (on x-axis) and Z (on y-axis). And N(0,6) is on that line. So, let me find coordinates for Y and Z.

Let me define variables. Let me say Y is (y, 0) since it's on the x-axis. Z is (0, z) since it's on the y-axis. Then, Line(Y,Z) connects (y, 0) to (0, z). The equation of this line can be parametrized. Since N(0,6) lies on this line, substituting x=0, y-coordinate must satisfy the line equation. Let me write the equation of line YZ.

The slope of YZ is (z - 0)/(0 - y) = -z/y. The equation can be written as:

(y - 0) = (-z/y)(x - y)

Wait, more accurately, the line passing through (y, 0) and (0, z) can be expressed as:

(x)/y + (y)/z = 1 ?

No, standard intercept form. Let me recall: the intercept form of a line is x/a + y/b = 1, where a and b are intercepts. Here, the x-intercept is y (the point Y is at (y, 0)), and the y-intercept is z (point Z is at (0,z)). So the equation is x/y + y/z = 1. Wait, actually, the general formula for intercept form is x/(x-intercept) + y/(y-intercept) = 1. So yes, the line YZ has equation x/y + y'/z = 1, where (y', 0) is the x-intercept and (0,z) is the y-intercept. Wait, but in our case, the x-intercept is at Y (which is (y,0)), so the x-intercept is y, and the y-intercept is z. Therefore, equation is x/y + y/z = 1. Now, point N(0,6) lies on this line. Substituting x=0, y=6 into the equation:

0/y + 6/z = 1 → 6/z = 1 → z = 6. Wait, but earlier, we had Z at (0, z), so z would be 6? But then Z would be at (0,6), which is the same as point N? No, because N is (0,6). Wait, that would imply Z is at (0,6), same as N. But that can't be unless Z=N. But in the problem statement, they mention different points. So this suggests an inconsistency. Where did I go wrong?

Ah! Wait, the PointLiesOnLine(N, Line(Y,Z)) says that N lies on line YZ. But if Z is at (0, z), and Y is at (y, 0), then the line YZ passes through N(0,6). But according to the equation above, substituting x=0, y=6 gives 0/y + 6/z = 1 ⇒ z = 6. So Z is at (0,6), which is the same as point N. Which would make Z coincide with N, but that's impossible. Hence, contradiction. So my assumption may be wrong.

Hmm. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the coordinates. Let me think again. 

Alternatively, maybe Z is not on the y-axis. Wait, earlier, I thought that since N lies on Line(X,Z), and X is at (0,0), then Z must be along the line XZ. If N is on that line, then Z can be anywhere along the line extended from X through N. Wait, but N is at (0,6) if we placed it on the y-axis. So Line(X,Z) would be the line starting at X(0,0) and going through N(0,6) and extending further. So Z would be a point along that line beyond N. So if N is between X and Z, then Z would be at (0, c) where c > 6. Alternatively, if X is between N and Z, then Z would be at (0, c) with c < 0. But given that NZ=9, the length from N to Z is 9. So if N is at (0,6), then Z is either (0,6+9)= (0,15) or (0,6-9)= (0,-3). Let me consider that possibility.

So if Z is at (0,15), then Line(X,Z) is the y-axis from (0,0) to (0,15), and N is at (0,6). Then, Line(Y,Z) connects Y (somewhere on x-axis) to Z (0,15). And N(0,6) lies on this line YZ. Let me use this scenario.

So Y is on the x-axis, say at (y, 0). Z is at (0,15). Then, the line YZ connects (y,0) to (0,15). The equation of this line can be found. Let me compute its equation. Slope m = (15 - 0)/(0 - y) = -15/y. Equation: y - 0 = m(x - y). So y = (-15/y)(x - y). To find where this line passes through N(0,6):

Substitute x=0, y=6 into the equation:

6 = (-15/y)(0 - y) → 6 = (-15/y)(-y) → 6 = 15 → 6=15? That's impossible. Contradiction again. What's wrong here?

Wait, the equation of the line YZ. Let me rederive it properly. Using two-point form. Between points (y, 0) and (0, 15). The parametric equations can be written as:

x = y - t*y, y = 0 + t*15, where t ranges from 0 to 1. But maybe better to use intercept form. The intercept form is x/(y) + y/(15) = 1. Wait, the x-intercept is at (y, 0), and the y-intercept is at (0,15). So equation is x/y + y'/15 = 1. Plugging in point N(0,6):

x=0, y'=6. So 0/y + 6/15 = 1 → 6/15 = 1 → 2/5 = 1? Not true. Still contradiction. So something is wrong.

This suggests that my initial assumption about placing X at (0,0) and M at (4,0), N at (0,6) leads to inconsistencies. Perhaps I need to adjust the coordinate system or consider another configuration.

Alternative approach: Maybe the right angles are at different points. Let me re-examine the Angle predicates. The first one is RightAngle(Angle(M,X,N)), which is angle at X between M and N. So triangle MXN is right-angled at X. Second is RightAngle(Angle(N,Z,Y)), which is angle at Z between N and Y, so triangle NZY is right-angled at Z.

Given that, let's think about the triangles. In triangle MXN, right-angled at X, with legs XM and XN. Given XM=4 and XN=6, so hypotenuse MN would be sqrt(4² + 6²) = sqrt(16+36) = sqrt(52) = 2√13. But maybe we don't need that yet.

Then, triangle NZY is right-angled at Z. So legs are NZ and ZY, with NZ=9 given. We need to find XY.

But how do these triangles relate? Also, the points' positions via the lying-on-line predicates.

We know that M lies on Line(X,Y). So line XY contains point M. N lies on Line(X,Z) and Line(Y,Z). So N is the intersection of lines XZ and YZ. Thus, lines XZ and YZ intersect at N. Therefore, points X, Z, Y, and N form a configuration where N is the intersection of XZ and YZ.

Let me try to visualize this. Imagine line XZ with N on it, and line YZ with N on it. So lines XZ and YZ meet at N. Hence, points X, Z, Y, and N form a sort of 'star' shape with N at the center. However, since M is on line XY, and given that triangle MXN is right-angled at X, perhaps there's a way to relate these elements.

Another idea: Since M is on line XY, and triangle MXN is right-angled at X, then line XY is the hypotenuse of that right triangle. Wait, no—right angle is at X, so sides XM and XN are the legs, and MN is the hypotenuse. So, line XY includes point M, which is at distance 4 from X. So, XY extends from X through M to Y. Therefore, the entire line XY has X and M on it, with XM=4. So, the length from X to M is 4 units. But where is Y? Y is another point on this line, possibly beyond M or before X.

Similarly, N is on line XZ, which extends from X through N to Z. And N is also on line YZ, which connects Y to Z. So, Z is a point such that line YZ passes through N.

Perhaps using vectors or coordinate geometry again, but carefully.

Let me assign coordinates again, trying to resolve previous contradictions.

Let me place point X at (0,0). Let me assume that line XY is horizontal for simplicity. Since M is on line XY and XM=4, let me put M at (4, 0). Since triangle MXN is right-angled at X, then XN must be perpendicular to XM. Since XM is along the x-axis, XN must be vertical. So N would be at (0, b) for some b. Given XN=6, then b=6 or -6. Let's choose (0,6) for simplicity.

Thus, N is at (0,6). Now, N lies on Line(X,Z). Since X is (0,0) and Z is some point along the line XZ. Since N is on XZ, Z is colinear with X and N. So Z is along the line from X(0,0) through N(0,6). Therefore, Z is at (0, c), where c ≠ 0. Given that NZ=9, the distance from N(0,6) to Z(0,c) is |c - 6| = 9. So c = 6 + 9 = 15 or c = 6 - 9 = -3. Let's pick Z as (0,15) for simplicity.

Now, N is also on Line(Y,Z). So Line(Y,Z) passes through N(0,6) and Z(0,15). Wait, but Z is at (0,15), so Line(Y,Z) is the vertical line x=0. But Y is a point on line XY, which is the x-axis. So Y is somewhere on the x-axis, say at (y, 0). But Line(Y,Z) connects Y(y,0) to Z(0,15). This line passes through N(0,6). Let me verify this.

The line from Y(y,0) to Z(0,15). Let me find its equation. The slope is (15 - 0)/(0 - y) = -15/y. The equation is: (y - 0) = (-15/y)(x - y). So rearranged: y = (-15/y)x + 15. Now, substitute point N(0,6) into this equation. When x=0, y= (-15/y)*0 + 15 → y=15. But the y-coordinate of N is 6, not 15. So substituting x=0 and y=6 into the equation gives 6 = 15? Which is false. Contradiction again. What's wrong?

Ah! The issue is that if Z is at (0,15), then Line(Y,Z) is from Y(y,0) to Z(0,15). The line passes through N(0,6)? Only if N lies on that line. Let me parametrize the line YZ. Let parameter t go from 0 to 1, with t=0 at Y(y,0) and t=1 at Z(0,15). Parametric equations:

x(t) = y - y*t

y(t) = 0 + 15*t

At point N(0,6), we have x(t)=0 and y(t)=6. Solving for t:

From x(t)=0: y - y*t = 0 → y*(1 - t) = 0. Assuming y ≠ 0 (since Y is not X, as X is at (0,0)), then 1 - t = 0 → t=1. At t=1, y(t)=15*t = 15, but we need y(t)=6. So this is only possible if 15=6, which is false. Therefore, contradiction again. So my assumption that Z is at (0,15) is invalid? Or maybe I made a wrong placement.

Wait, maybe Z is not on the y-axis? But N is on Line(X,Z), so if X is (0,0) and N is (0,6), then Line(X,Z) is the line passing through X(0,0) and N(0,6), which is the y-axis. Hence, Z must be on the y-axis. Hence, Z is at (0, c), leading to contradiction in the line YZ passing through N. So why is this happening?

Maybe my assumption about the position of Y is incorrect. Let me think differently. Suppose Y is not on the x-axis. Wait, but M lies on Line(X,Y), and we placed M at (4,0) on the x-axis. Hence, Line(X,Y) must pass through X(0,0) and M(4,0), so it's the x-axis. Hence, Y must be on the x-axis. So Y is on x-axis, hence Y is (y,0). So this seems unavoidable.

Therefore, the only way for Line(Y,Z) to pass through N(0,6) is if Z is chosen such that the line from Y(y,0) to Z(0,c) passes through N(0,6). Let me derive the condition for this.

For line YZ to pass through N(0,6), the three points Y(y,0), Z(0,c), and N(0,6) must be colinear. Since Z is on the y-axis (from earlier), and N is also on the y-axis (since N is (0,6)), then the line YZ must pass through N(0,6) and Z(0,c). But if Z is on the y-axis, then line YZ connects Y(y,0) to Z(0,c). This line passes through N(0,6) only if N is between Y and Z or outside. But since Z is on the y-axis, and N is also on the y-axis, then the line YZ connects Y(y,0) to Z(0,c) and passes through N(0,6) only if N is on the segment YZ or its extension. 

However, since N is on Line(X,Z), which is the y-axis, and also on Line(Y,Z), which connects Y(y,0) to Z(0,c). So for N(0,6) to be on that line, the line YZ must pass through (0,6). Let me express the condition for this.

The line connecting Y(y,0) and Z(0,c) can be parametrized as follows: any point on the line can be expressed as (y - ty, 0 + tc) where t ∈ R. Wait, alternatively, using two-point form. The equation of line YZ is (x - y)/(0 - y) = (z - 0)/(0 - y)? Wait, no. Let me calculate the slope. The slope m = (c - 0)/(0 - y) = -c/y. The equation is (y - 0) = m(x - y). So y = (-c/y)(x - y). Rearranged: y = (-c/y)x + c. 

For this line to pass through N(0,6), substituting x=0, y=6:

6 = (-c/y)(0) + c → 6 = c. So c must be 6. But earlier, we had NZ=9. Since N is at (0,6) and Z is at (0,c), then the distance NZ is |c - 6| = 9. So c = 6 ±9. If c=6, then NZ=0, which contradicts NZ=9. If c=6-9=-3, then c=-3, so Z is at (0,-3). Let me check this.

So if c=-3, then Z is at (0,-3). Now, the line YZ connects Y(y,0) to Z(0,-3). The equation of this line is y = (-(-3)/y)(x - y) → y = (3/y)(x - y). Simplifying: y = (3/y)x - 3. Now, check if N(0,6) lies on this line. Substitute x=0, y=6:

6 = (3/y)*0 - 3 → 6 = -3 → False. Still contradiction. 

Wait, what's the problem here? According to the earlier calculation, for the line YZ to pass through N(0,6), c must be 6. But then NZ would be zero. Hence, contradiction. So there's a fundamental flaw in this setup. How come?

This suggests that under the current assumptions, it's impossible for N to lie on both Line(X,Z) and Line(Y,Z) while having NZ=9. Unless there's a miscalculation.

Wait, let's re-derive the condition. The line YZ passes through N(0,6). Let me use the two-point form again. The line passing through Y(y,0) and Z(0,c) has equation:

(x - y)/(0 - y) = (z - 0)/(0 - y) ? No, better to use parameters. Let me use the determinant method for collinearity. Three points (y,0), (0,c), and (0,6) are collinear if the area of the triangle formed by them is zero.

Area = ½ | y*(c - 6) + 0*(6 - 0) + 0*(0 - c)| = ½ | y(c - 6)| = 0 → y(c - 6) = 0. Since y ≠ 0 (as Y is not X), this requires c - 6 = 0 → c = 6. So again, c must be 6. But then NZ = |c - 6| = 0. Contradicts NZ=9. Hence, this suggests that under the current coordinate setup, it's impossible. Which means my initial assumption about the placement of points is flawed.

Alternative idea: Maybe the right angle is not at X or Z, but elsewhere? Wait, the predicates state RightAngle(Angle(M,X,N)) and RightAngle(Angle(N,Z,Y)). So angle at X in triangle MXN, and angle at Z in triangle NZY. So my previous understanding was correct.

Another possibility: Maybe the lines are not straight in the way I assumed. For instance, perhaps Line(X,Z) is not the same as the line containing X and Z, but maybe another interpretation. But no, Line(X,Z) is the line passing through X and Z.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider the configuration. Let me think about the triangles again. Triangle MXN is right-angled at X, so XM ⊥ XN. Triangle NZY is right-angled at Z, so NZ ⊥ ZY. Also, N is on both Line(X,Z) and Line(Y,Z). So, let me consider vector approaches.

Let me denote vectors. Let me set X as origin. Let vector XM = vector a, and vector XN = vector b. Since angle at X is right, vectors a and b are perpendicular. Given XM=4, so |a|=4; XN=6, so |b|=6. 

Now, point M is on Line(X,Y), so vector YM is colinear with vector XY. Let me denote vector XY as vector c. Since M is on line XY, vector XM = k * vector XY for some scalar k. So vector a = k * vector c. Hence, vector c = a/k.

Point N is on Line(X,Z), so vector XN = m * vector XZ for some scalar m. Let me denote vector XZ as vector d. So vector b = m * vector d. Hence, vector d = b/m.

Additionally, N is on Line(Y,Z). So vector YN is colinear with vector YZ. Let me express vector YZ = vector Z - vector Y. But vector Y = vector XY = vector c. Vector Z = vector XZ = vector d. So vector YZ = vector Z - vector Y = vector d - vector c.

Vector YN = vector N - vector Y = vector b - vector c.

Since N is on line YZ, there exists a scalar λ such that vector YN = λ * vector YZ. So:

vector b - vector c = λ(vector d - vector c).

But vector d = b/m, so:

vector b - vector c = λ(b/m - vector c).

Rearrange:

vector b - vector c = (λ/m) b - λ vector c.

Bring all terms to left-hand side:

vector b - vector c - (λ/m)b + λ vector c = 0 → [1 - λ/m] vector b + [-1 + λ] vector c = 0.

Since vectors b and c are not necessarily colinear (unless specified), the coefficients must be zero:

1 - λ/m = 0 → λ = m.

-1 + λ = 0 → λ = 1.

Hence, m = λ = 1. So from this, m = 1. Therefore, vector d = vector b. So vector XZ = vector b, which means Z is at vector b, i.e., Z coincides with N? No, because vector XZ = vector d = b, so Z is at X + vector d = X + vector b = N. But this would imply Z = N, which contradicts the existence of distinct points. Hence, this suggests inconsistency, implying that my assumptions are wrong.

This indicates that the configuration might require another approach. Perhaps the triangles are not positioned as I initially thought.

Alternative idea: Maybe the right angles are not at X and Z, but at other points? Let me recheck the predicates. The first RightAngle(Angle(M,X,N)) means the angle at X between M and N. The second is RightAngle(Angle(N,Z,Y)), meaning angle at Z between N and Y. So, yes, right angles at X and Z.

Perhaps I need to use similar triangles or other relations. Let me think about the triangles MXN and NZY. Since both are right-angled, and some points are aligned.

Given that M is on line XY, and N is on line XZ and YZ. Let me consider the lines and their intersections.

Since N is on both XZ and YZ, it's the intersection of XZ and YZ. So, lines XZ and YZ meet at N. Therefore, lines XZ and YZ form a 'V' shape at N. With XZ passing through X and Z, and YZ passing through Y and Z.

Now, since triangle MXN is right-angled at X, and M is on line XY, which connects X and Y. So, line XY contains M, and triangle MXN is right-angled at X. So, XN is perpendicular to XM. Hence, line XN is perpendicular to line XM.

Similarly, triangle NZY is right-angled at Z, so line ZN is perpendicular to line ZY.

Let me try to find relations between the segments. Given XM=4, XN=6, NZ=9. Need to find XY.

Let me consider coordinates again, but this time without assuming specific axes.

Let me place X at (0,0). Let me let line XM be along the x-axis, so M is at (4,0). Since angle at X is right, line XN must be perpendicular to XM, so along y-axis. Hence, N is at (0,6). 

Now, N is on line XZ, so line XZ passes through X(0,0) and N(0,6), so it's the y-axis. Hence, Z is somewhere on y-axis. Let Z be at (0, z). Given NZ=9, the distance from N(0,6) to Z(0,z) is |z - 6| = 9 → z = 15 or z = -3. Let's take z = 15, so Z is at (0,15).

Now, N is also on line YZ. Line YZ connects Y and Z. Since Z is at (0,15), and N is at (0,6), which is on line YZ. So line YZ passes through N(0,6) and Z(0,15). Hence, this line is the vertical line x=0. But Y is on line XY, which is the x-axis (since M is on it). So Y is at some point (y,0). But line YZ is x=0, so Y must be at (0,0) or (0, something), but Y cannot be at X, as X is already at (0,0). Hence, this is impossible unless Y is at (0,0), which it isn't. Hence, contradiction.

Wait, unless Y is at (0,0), but that's X. Hence, this suggests that my assumption is wrong. What if Z is at (0,-3)? Then NZ = |-3 - 6| = 9, which works. So Z is at (0,-3). Now, line YZ connects Y(y,0) to Z(0,-3). This line passes through N(0,6)? Let me check.

Line YZ passes through Y(y,0) and Z(0,-3). Let me find the equation of this line. Slope m = (-3 - 0)/(0 - y) = 3/y. Equation: y - 0 = (3/y)(x - y). So y = (3/y)x - 3. Now, does this line pass through N(0,6)? Substituting x=0, y=6: 6 = (3/y)*0 - 3 → 6 = -3 → No. Still contradiction.

This suggests that regardless of Z's position on the y-axis, line YZ cannot pass through N(0,6) unless Y is at infinity or something. Hence, there must be a mistake in the initial assumptions.

Wait, perhaps the right angles are not at X and Z, but at M and Y? No, the predicates specify RightAngle(Angle(M,X,N)) and RightAngle(Angle(N,Z,Y)), so the right angles are at X and Z.

Maybe the error is in assuming that line XZ is the y-axis. Let me try a different coordinate system. Let me not fix X at (0,0) but instead use variables.

Let me let X be at (0,0), M at (a, 0) since XM=4, so a=4. N is at (0, b) since XN=6, so b=6. So N is at (0,6). Line XZ passes through X(0,0) and N(0,6), so it's the y-axis. Z is at (0, c), with |c - 6| = 9 → c=15 or -3. Let's take c=15, Z=(0,15). Now, line YZ must pass through N(0,6). Y is on line XY, which is the x-axis, so Y is at (d, 0). Line YZ connects (d,0) to (0,15). This line passes through N(0,6). Let me find d such that this is true.

Parametrize line YZ: from (d,0) to (0,15). The parametric equations can be written as x = d - dt, y = 0 + 15t, where t ∈ [0,1]. We want this line to pass through (0,6). So, find t such that x=0 and y=6.

From x=0: d - dt = 0 → d(1 - t) = 0. Since d ≠ 0 (as Y is not X), this implies t=1. At t=1, y=15*1 = 15, but we need y=6. Hence, no solution unless 15=6, which is false. So this is impossible.

Same result if Z is at (0,-3). Line YZ connects (d,0) to (0,-3). Parametric equations: x = d - dt, y = 0 - 3t. Want x=0, y=6. From x=0: d(1-t)=0 → t=1. At t=1, y=-3*1 = -3 ≠ 6. Again contradiction.

This suggests that under the given conditions, it's impossible for N to lie on both Line(X,Z) and Line(Y,Z) while satisfying NZ=9. But the problem states that such a configuration exists, so I must have made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the right angle is not at X or Z, but at another point? Let me re-read the predicates. The first RightAngle is Angle(M,X,N), which is the angle at X between M and N. So yes, right angle at X. Second is Angle(N,Z,Y), angle at Z between N and Y, so right angle at Z. So the previous analysis holds.

Another possibility: Maybe the lines are not straight? No, lines are straight by definition. Or perhaps the points are not in the plane? The problem doesn't specify, but generally assumes planar geometry.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that N is not between X and Z, but extend in the opposite direction. For example, if Z is on the opposite side of N from X. Let me try that. Let me take Z such that X is between N and Z. So, if N is at (0,6), then Z is on the line XN extended beyond N. So, from X(0,0) through N(0,6) to Z. The distance from N to Z is 9, so Z is at (0,6 + 9) = (0,15) or (0,6 - 9) = (0,-3). As before.

But even so, the line YZ still doesn't pass through N. Hence, this suggests that the only way for N to be on Line(Y,Z) is if Y is at (0,0), which is X, but that's not allowed. Hence, there's a contradiction, implying that my initial assumptions about the configuration are incorrect.

Perhaps the right angle at Z is not part of triangle NZY, but another triangle? Let me check the predicates: RightAngle(Angle(N,Z,Y)), which is part of triangle NZY. So triangle NZY has right angle at Z.

Wait, maybe I should consider that triangle NZY is right-angled at Z, so ZY is perpendicular to NZ. Since NZ is along the y-axis (from N(0,6) to Z(0,15)), then ZY must be horizontal. Hence, line ZY is horizontal, so Y has the same y-coordinate as Z. Since Z is at (0,15), then Y must be on the horizontal line y=15. But Y is also on line XY, which is the x-axis (since M is on it). Hence, Y must be at the intersection of x-axis and y=15, which is only at (0,15), but that's Z. So Y would be Z, which is not allowed. Hence, contradiction.

This is getting too tangled. Maybe I need to abandon coordinate geometry and use geometric theorems.

Given the triangles and right angles, perhaps using similarity or Pythagoras.

In triangle MXN, right-angled at X, with legs XM=4 and XN=6. Hypotenuse MN = √(4² + 6²) = √52 = 2√13.

In triangle NZY, right-angled at Z, with leg NZ=9, and other leg ZY. Let's call ZY = a, then hypotenuse NY = √(9² + a²).

But how do these triangles relate? Since N is on both Line(X,Z) and Line(Y,Z), and M is on Line(X,Y). Let me consider the lines.

Since M is on Line(X,Y), and N is on Line(X,Z) and Line(Y,Z), perhaps there's a relationship between these lines. Let me consider triangles MXN and NZY.

Wait, perhaps triangles MXN and NZY are similar? Or maybe some other relation.

Alternatively, since N is on Line(Y,Z), and M is on Line(X,Y), maybe there's a way to relate the lengths using similar triangles.

Alternatively, since N is on Line(X,Z), and Line(Y,Z), then Z is the intersection of lines XZ and YZ. So, lines XZ and YZ meet at N. Hence, Z is the common point of these two lines.

Wait, if I consider triangles MXN and NZY, maybe there's a way to express XY in terms of other lengths.

Let me think about the entire line XY. M is on it, with XM=4. We need to find XY. Let me denote XY = k, so that MY = k - 4.

Since N is on Line(X,Z) and Line(Y,Z), and Z is a point such that NZ=9. Also, in triangle NZY, which is right-angled at Z, so ZY is one leg, NZ=9 is the other leg, and NY is the hypotenuse.

But how to relate ZY to other parts? Let me think about the line YZ. Since N is on YZ, and NZ=9, then ZY = ZN + NY or ZY = |ZN - NY| depending on the position. Wait, but ZY is a length, so if N is between Y and Z, then ZY = ZN + NY. If Y is between Z and N, then ZY = |ZN - NY|. But without knowing the position, it's hard to say.

But perhaps using the right triangle NZY: ZY^2 + NZ^2 = NY^2. So ZY^2 + 81 = NY^2.

But how to find ZY or NY? Maybe relating to other parts.

Also, since N is on Line(X,Z), and XN=6, NZ=9, so XZ = XN + NZ = 6 + 9 = 15 if N is between X and Z. Or XZ = |XN - NZ| = 3 if N is between Z and X. But assuming N is between X and Z, XZ = 15.

Now, consider line YZ. Since N is on YZ, and Z is on XZ, perhaps there's a way to relate YZ with other segments.

But I'm stuck. Maybe using mass point geometry or coordinate geometry with variables.

Let me try again with coordinates, but this time letting Y be arbitrary.

Let me set X at (0,0), M at (4,0), N at (0,6). Line XZ is the y-axis, so Z is at (0,15) or (0,-3). Let's take Z at (0,15). Line YZ passes through N(0,6) and Z(0,15). This line is the vertical line x=0. But Y is on line XY, which is the x-axis. Hence, Y must be at (y,0). The line YZ is x=0, so Y must be at (0,0) or (0, something), but Y cannot be at X. Hence, this is impossible. Therefore, the only way for YZ to pass through N is if Y is at (0,0), which is X, but that's not allowed. Hence, contradiction.

This suggests that the problem might have a typo, or I'm missing a key insight.

Wait, perhaps the right angle at Z is not in triangle NZY, but in another triangle? Let me check the predicates again. The second RightAngle is Angle(N,Z,Y), which is angle at Z between N and Y, so it's part of triangle NZY, which is right-angled at Z. So, yes.

Another idea: Maybe the right angle at Z is not between NZ and ZY, but between other segments? No, the Angle(N,Z,Y) is at Z between N and Y, so it's between NZ and ZY.

Wait, perhaps the triangle NZY is not right-angled at Z, but at Y? No, the predicate specifies Angle(N,Z,Y), so it's at Z.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach, like using vectors or ratios.

Let me consider that since N is on Line(X,Z) and Line(Y,Z), then Z is the intersection of lines XZ and YZ. Hence, Z is determined by the intersection of these two lines. Given that, and the right angles, perhaps using similar triangles.

In triangle MXN, right-angled at X, with XM=4, XN=6. Let me find the coordinates of M and N as before: X(0,0), M(4,0), N(0,6). Now, line XY contains M(4,0) and Y. Let me let Y be at (k, 0), so that XY is from (0,0) to (k,0). Then, line YZ passes through N(0,6) and Z. Since Z is on line XZ (which is the y-axis), Z is at (0, c). The line YZ connects Y(k,0) to Z(0,c) and passes through N(0,6). 

The equation of line YZ: passing through (k,0) and (0,c). The slope is (c - 0)/(0 - k) = -c/k. The equation is y = (-c/k)(x - k). This line passes through N(0,6): substitute x=0, y=6:

6 = (-c/k)(0 - k) → 6 = (-c/k)(-k) → 6 = c. So c=6. Hence, Z is at (0,6), which is the same as N. But this implies Z=N, which is not allowed. Hence, contradiction. 

This suggests that under these conditions, Z must coincide with N, which is not permitted. Hence, the only way this works is if the distance NZ is zero, but the problem states NZ=9. Hence, this implies that the initial assumptions about the configuration are incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the right angle at Z is not in the triangle NZY, but in another triangle? Let me recheck the predicates. The second RightAngle is Angle(N,Z,Y), which is part of triangle NZY. So it must be right-angled at Z. 

This is very perplexing. Maybe the problem involves 3D geometry? But the predicates suggest planar geometry.

Wait, perhaps the lines are not in the same plane? No, typically, geometry problems assume planar unless stated otherwise.

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach, using the given lengths and the right angles to find XY through similar triangles or other relations.

Let me consider the following: In triangle MXN, right-angled at X, with XM=4, XN=6. Let me find the length of MN: √(4² + 6²) = √52.
