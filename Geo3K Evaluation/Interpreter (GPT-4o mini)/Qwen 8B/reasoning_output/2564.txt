Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have two circles: Circle(A) and Circle(H). Also, there's a rectangle defined by points C, D, E, F. Then there are some lines mentioned: Line(H,B) is a radius of Circle(H), Line(A,E) is a radius of Circle(A). There are also some perpendicular and parallel relationships between lines. Plus, specific lengths are given: Length of Line(C,F) is 5 units, and Length of Line(C,D) is 10 units.

First, let me visualize the rectangle. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. The lines CD and EF are parallel, and CF and DE are perpendicular. Wait, the predicates say Parallel(Line(C,D), Line(F,E)) and Perpendicular(Line(C,F), Line(D,E)). So Line CD is parallel to Line FE, and Line CF is perpendicular to Line DE. That makes sense because in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular.

Now, since CDEF is a rectangle, CD and EF are opposite sides, so they should be equal in length. Similarly, CF and DE are opposite sides. Given that Length(C,D) is 10, so CD = 10, which means EF is also 10. Also, Length(C,F) is 5, so CF = 5, meaning DE is also 5.

Wait, but in a rectangle, adjacent sides are length and width. So if CD is one side (say, horizontal) with length 10, then CF would be vertical with length 5. But wait, in a rectangle, the sides are connected such that CD and CF meet at point C. So CD is horizontal, CF is vertical. Therefore, the rectangle has sides of length 10 and 5. Therefore, the area of the rectangle would be 10*5=50. However, the question asks for the area of the shaded region, which probably involves subtracting some parts, maybe involving the circles?

But we have two circles here: Circle(A) and Circle(H). Let me check the radii. Line(A,E) is a radius of Circle(A), so AE is a radius. Similarly, Line(H,B) is a radius of Circle(H), so HB is a radius. Now, where are points A, B located? The problem doesn't explicitly state their positions, but perhaps they are related to the rectangle?

Let me think. Maybe points A and H are centers of the circles? For example, if Circle(A) has center at point A, then Line(A,E) being a radius implies that E lies on the circumference of Circle(A). Similarly, Line(H,B) being a radius suggests that B lies on Circle(H). 

So, if E is a point on Circle(A), and since E is part of the rectangle, maybe E is one of the rectangle's vertices? Let me see. In the rectangle CDEF, the vertices are C, D, E, F. So E is connected to D and F. If Line(A,E) is a radius, then point A is the center of Circle(A), and E is on the circle. Similarly, Line(H,B) is a radius, so H is the center of Circle(H), and B is on that circle.

But how do these circles relate to the rectangle? Perhaps the circles intersect the rectangle or overlap in some way? The shaded region might be the area inside the rectangle but outside the circles, or vice versa. Without seeing the diagram, I need to infer based on the given info.

Alternatively, maybe the shaded region refers to the overlapping area between the circles and the rectangle? Or perhaps the area of the rectangle minus the areas of the circles?

Wait, but the problem mentions a shaded region, which isn't described, so I have to make assumptions. Let me try to reconstruct the figure mentally.

Given that there are two circles, and lines connecting them. Let me consider coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to the rectangle could help.

Let me assign coordinates to the rectangle. Let’s assume point C is at (0,0). Since CD is 10 units long, and assuming CD is horizontal, then D would be at (10,0). Then, since CF is 5 units vertically upwards, point F would be at (0,5), and point E would be at (10,5). Thus, the rectangle CDEF has coordinates C(0,0), D(10,0), E(10,5), F(0,5).

Now, looking at the circles. Circle(A): Line(A,E) is a radius. So point A is the center of Circle(A), and E is a point on the circle. Similarly, Circle(H): Line(H,B) is a radius, so H is the center of Circle(H), and B is on that circle.

Assuming that point E is (10,5), which is a vertex of the rectangle. Then, if Line(A,E) is a radius, then the distance from A to E is the radius of Circle(A). Similarly, for Circle(H), the distance from H to B is its radius.

But where are points A and B? They aren't specified yet. Maybe they are points inside the rectangle? Or maybe they're connected to other elements?

Wait, the problem mentions Line(C,F) which connects C(0,0) to F(0,5), which is vertical. And Line(C,D) is horizontal from (0,0) to (10,0). Also, Line(C,F) is perpendicular to Line(D,E), which is the line from D(10,0) to E(10,5), which is vertical. Wait, Line(D,E) is vertical, so Line(C,F) is vertical as well, making them parallel? Wait, no. Wait, Line(C,F) is vertical (from (0,0) to (0,5)), and Line(D,E) is vertical (from (10,0) to (10,5)), so they are parallel. But according to the predicate, they are perpendicular. Wait, that contradicts. Wait, the predicate says Perpendicular(Line(C,F), Line(D,E)). But Line(C,F) is vertical, Line(D,E) is vertical, so they are parallel, not perpendicular. That seems like a contradiction. Did I misinterpret something?

Wait, let me check again. The predicates are:

Perpendicular(Line(C,F), Line(D,E))

But Line(C,F) goes from C to F, which in my coordinate system is vertical. Line(D,E) goes from D to E, which is also vertical. So those two lines are parallel, not perpendicular. This suggests that my assumption about the coordinates may be wrong.

Hmm. So there's a mistake in my initial setup. Let me re-examine the problem.

The rectangle has sides CD and EF parallel, and CF and DE perpendicular. So Line(C,D) is parallel to Line(F,E), and Line(C,F) is perpendicular to Line(D,E). Wait, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So if CD is one side, then CF would be adjacent to it, hence perpendicular. But according to the given, Line(C,F) is perpendicular to Line(D,E). Let me clarify.

In the rectangle, Line(D,E) is one of the sides. Let's think again about the rectangle's structure. Points C, D, E, F arranged such that CD and EF are opposite sides, and CF and DE are opposite sides. So, the sides CD and EF are parallel; CF and DE are parallel. Also, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So, CD is perpendicular to CF, and CF is perpendicular to DE, etc.

But the predicate says Perpendicular(Line(C,F), Line(D,E)). So Line(C,F) is perpendicular to Line(D,E). Which in the rectangle, Line(C,F) is adjacent to Line(DE)? Wait, Line(DE) is one of the sides. Let me imagine the rectangle.

Let me define the rectangle properly. Let me label the rectangle as follows: suppose it's a standard rectangle with points C, D, E, F arranged clockwise. So, starting at C, moving to D, then to E, then to F, back to C. So, sides CD, DE, EF, FC.

Thus, Line(C,D) is CD, Line(D,E) is DE, Line(E,F) is EF, Line(F,C) is FC.

Then, according to the given, Line(C,D) is parallel to Line(F,E). So CD || FE. Which makes sense because in a rectangle, opposite sides are parallel.

Also, Perpendicular(Line(C,F), Line(D,E)): Line(CF) is FC, which is one side, and Line(DE) is another side. In a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So, FC is adjacent to DE? No, FC is adjacent to CD and FE. Wait, DE is adjacent to DC and FE. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Let me draw this mentally again. Suppose the rectangle is C-D-E-F-C. So, CD is one side, DE is next, EF is next, and FC closes the shape. Then, Line(C,D) is CD, Line(D,E) is DE, Line(E,F) is EF, Line(F,C) is FC.

Now, Line(C,F) is FC, and Line(D,E) is DE. Are these lines perpendicular? In the rectangle, FC is adjacent to CD and FE. DE is adjacent to CD and FE. Wait, DE is connected to D and E. So DE is one side, FC is another side. Are they perpendicular? Not necessarily unless the rectangle is a square. Wait, but in general rectangles, adjacent sides are perpendicular, but FC and DE are opposite sides. Wait, FC and DE are both sides of the rectangle, but they are opposite and parallel. Because in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and parallel. So FC is parallel to DE. Therefore, Line(C,F) is parallel to Line(D,E), which contradicts the given predicate that they are perpendicular. So there's a contradiction here. Which means my understanding of the rectangle's configuration is wrong.

This indicates that my initial assignment of the rectangle's structure is incorrect. Let me rethink the labeling of the rectangle's points.

Perhaps the rectangle is labeled differently. Maybe the order is C, D, F, E instead of C, D, E, F? Let me try that. Suppose the rectangle is C-D-F-E-C. Then, sides are CD, DF, FE, EC.

Wait, but the given predicates mention Line(C,D), Line(F,E), Line(C,F), Line(D,E). Let me check the perpendicularity again. The predicate says Perpendicular(Line(C,F), Line(D,E)). So Line(C,F) and Line(D,E) are perpendicular. If the rectangle is C-D-F-E-C, then Line(C,F) would be diagonal? No, wait, if it's a rectangle, the sides are straight. So if the rectangle is C, D, F, E arranged such that CD and FE are opposite sides, and CF and DE are opposite sides.

Wait, perhaps the rectangle is C, D, E, F arranged such that CD is one side, DE is another, EF is third, and FC is fourth. Wait, but then Line(C,F) is the same as FC, which would be adjacent to CD and FE. Line(D,E) is DE, which is adjacent to CD and FE. So, Line(C,F) and Line(D,E) are adjacent sides? No, Line(C,F) is FC, which is adjacent to CD and FE. Line(D,E) is DE, which is adjacent to CD and FE. So, FC and DE are both sides connected to CD and FE. Wait, but FC and DE are opposite sides. Hence, they should be parallel. But the predicate says they are perpendicular. So there's still inconsistency.

Ah! Maybe the labels are different. Maybe the rectangle is not in order C-D-E-F, but rather C, D, E, F in a way that Line(C,F) is one side and Line(D,E) is another. Let me try to find the correct configuration.

Let me denote the rectangle with vertices C, D, E, F such that CD is one side, DE is another, EF is third, and FC is fourth. Then, Line(C,D) is CD, Line(D,E) is DE, Line(E,F) is EF, Line(F,C) is FC.

Now, the given predicate says Parallel(Line(C,D), Line(F,E)). Line(C,D) is CD, Line(F,E) is EF. These are opposite sides of the rectangle, so they should be parallel. Correct. Then, Perpendicular(Line(C,F), Line(D,E)): Line(C,F) is FC, Line(D,E) is DE. Are these perpendicular? In a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So FC is adjacent to CD and FE. DE is adjacent to CD and FE. So FC and DE are opposite sides, thus parallel. So again, the predicate says they are perpendicular, which contradicts.

Therefore, my assumption about the rectangle's configuration must be wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the lines are not the sides but diagonals? Wait, the problem says Rectangle(C,D,E,F), which usually denotes the rectangle with vertices C, D, E, F connected in order. So the sides are CD, DE, EF, FC. But according to the given predicates, Line(C,F) and Line(D,E) are perpendicular. So Line(C,F) is FC, which is a side, and Line(D,E) is DE, which is another side. For these to be perpendicular, FC and DE must be perpendicular. But in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So if FC and DE are adjacent sides, then yes, they would be perpendicular. But in a rectangle, FC is adjacent to CD and FE, while DE is adjacent to CD and FE. So FC and DE are opposite sides. Wait, but if the rectangle is a square, then all sides are equal, but even then, FC and DE are opposite sides, so they are parallel. 

This suggests that there's a misunderstanding. Let me think again. Maybe the lines are not the sides but something else. Wait, the problem states "Rectangle(C,D,E,F)"—this typically defines a rectangle with vertices C, D, E, F. So the sides are CD, DE, EF, FC. So Line(C,F) is FC, which is one side, and Line(D,E) is DE, which is another side. For these two lines to be perpendicular, FC and DE must be perpendicular. But in a rectangle, FC is parallel to DE. Unless the rectangle is degenerate, which it isn't. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, there must be an error in my interpretation.

Wait, perhaps the lines are not the sides of the rectangle but diagonals? Like Line(C,F) and Line(D,E) are diagonals? Let me check. If Line(C,F) is a diagonal, then it connects C to F, and Line(D,E) connects D to E. In a rectangle, diagonals are equal and bisect each other but are not perpendicular unless it's a square. But the predicate says they are perpendicular. So if Line(C,F) and Line(D,E) are diagonals, then the rectangle would have to be a square. But we know that the length of Line(C,D) is 10 and Line(C,F) is 5. In a square, all sides are equal, so that's impossible. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, maybe Line(C,F) is a side, and Line(D,E) is a diagonal? Let me see. If Line(D,E) is a diagonal, then E is a vertex, D is another vertex. So if Line(D,E) is a diagonal, then E would be opposite to D. But in the rectangle, the diagonals connect opposite corners. So, for example, if the rectangle is C-D-E-F, then the diagonals are CE and DF. So if Line(D,E) is a diagonal, then D is connected to E, which would mean that E is the opposite corner of D. So if D is one corner, E is the opposite corner, making DE a diagonal. Then, Line(C,F) is a side. For these to be perpendicular, the diagonal DE and the side CF must be perpendicular. Is that possible?

Let me try to calculate. Assume the rectangle has length CD = 10 and CF = 5. Let me place the rectangle in coordinates again. Let's say point C is at (0,0). Since CD is 10 units, let's say D is at (10,0). CF is 5 units. Assuming CF is vertical, then F would be at (0,5). Then E would be at (10,5). Now, Line(D,E) is from D(10,0) to E(10,5), which is vertical, and Line(C,F) is from C(0,0) to F(0,5), also vertical. So these lines are parallel, not perpendicular. Again, contradiction.

Wait, but if Line(D,E) is a diagonal, then E wouldn't be at (10,5). Instead, if D is at (10,0), and E is at (0,5), making DE a diagonal. But then E would not be a vertex of the rectangle. This complicates things.

I think I need to reconsider the entire setup. Let me take a different approach. Let's focus on the given predicates and derive relationships.

We have a rectangle CDEF. From the given, CD is 10, CF is 5. Also, Line(C,D) is parallel to Line(F,E), and Line(C,F) is perpendicular to Line(D,E). 

Since CD is parallel to FE, and CF is perpendicular to DE, then in the rectangle, these conditions imply certain properties. Let me consider vectors.

Let me assign coordinates again, but more carefully. Let me set point C at origin (0,0). Let me assume that Line(C,D) is along the x-axis, so D is at (a, 0). Since CD is length 10, a = 10. So D is at (10,0). 

Now, Line(C,F) is perpendicular to Line(D,E). Let me call vector CF and vector DE. Since CF is perpendicular to DE, their dot product is zero.

Let me denote coordinates for F and E. Let me assume that Line(C,F) has direction (p, q), and Line(D,E) has direction (r, s). Their dot product p*r + q*s = 0.

Also, since CDEF is a rectangle, the vector CD (from C to D) is (10, 0). Vector CF (from C to F) is (x, y). Vector DE (from D to E) should be equal to vector CF, because in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and parallel. So DE = CF, so vector DE = (x, y). Therefore, E = D + vector DE = (10 + x, 0 + y) = (10+x, y). Also, since F is connected to E via FE, which is parallel to CD. Vector FE should be equal to CD, which is (10, 0). So vector FE = E - F = (10+x - x, y - y) = (10, 0), which checks out. 

Additionally, Line(C,F) is perpendicular to Line(D,E). Vector CF is (x, y), and vector DE is (x, y) as well (since DE equals CF). Wait, but the condition is that Line(C,F) is perpendicular to Line(D,E). But if vector CF is (x,y) and vector DE is (x,y), then their dot product is x*x + y*y, which equals |CF|². For them to be perpendicular, this must be zero, implying x² + y² = 0, which only occurs if x=y=0. But that would collapse the rectangle to a line, which is impossible. Contradiction again!

This suggests that my assumption that DE equals CF is wrong. Wait, but in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and parallel. So CD is equal and parallel to FE, and CF is equal and parallel to DE. So vector CD = vector FE, and vector CF = vector DE. Therefore, vector DE should equal vector CF. Hence, the earlier calculation applies. But this leads to a contradiction with the perpendicularity condition. 

This implies that there's an inconsistency in the given predicates, or my understanding is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the lines are not the sides but something else?

Wait, the predicate says Perpendicular(Line(C,F), Line(D,E)). So Line(C,F) is one line, and Line(D,E) is another. These lines are not necessarily sides of the rectangle. Wait, but in the rectangle, Line(C,F) would be a side if F is a vertex. Let me try once more.

Suppose CDEF is a rectangle with C, D, E, F as vertices. So sides are CD, DE, EF, FC. Then, Line(C,F) is FC, and Line(D,E) is DE. As before, these are opposite sides of the rectangle, which should be parallel, not perpendicular. Hence, the given predicate conflicts with this.

Unless the rectangle is actually a square, but even then, opposite sides are parallel. 

Wait, maybe the lines are not the sides but the diagonals? Let me assume that Line(C,F) is a diagonal from C to F, and Line(D,E) is another diagonal from D to E. In that case, the diagonals of a rectangle are equal and bisect each other, but are they perpendicular? Only in a square. If the rectangle is a square, then diagonals are perpendicular. But in our case, CD is 10 and CF is 5, so if it were a square, all sides would be equal, which they are not. Hence, this is not possible.

This is perplexing. There must be a misunderstanding in how the rectangle is labeled. Let me try a different labeling. What if the rectangle is labeled C, F, E, D? So the vertices are C, F, E, D. Then, the sides would be CF, FE, ED, DC. Now, Line(C,D) would be DC, Line(F,E) is FE. These are opposite sides, hence parallel. Line(C,F) is CF, Line(D,E) is ED. Are these perpendicular? In this case, CF and ED are opposite sides, hence parallel. Still not perpendicular.

Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is C, D, F, E. So sides are CD, DF, FE, EC. Then Line(C,D) is CD, Line(F,E) is FE, which are opposite sides and parallel. Line(C,F) is CF, which is a diagonal? Or is it a side? If the rectangle is C-D-F-E, then sides are CD, DF, FE, EC. So Line(C,F) would be a diagonal from C to F, passing through D? No, in this case, CF would cross through the interior. But the predicate says Line(C,F) is perpendicular to Line(D,E). Let me define coordinates again.

Let me place point C at (0,0). Assume CD is along x-axis, D at (10,0). Then, since it's a rectangle, DF would be vertical. Let me say DF is of length 5, so F would be at (10,5). Then, E would be at (0,5) to close the rectangle. So the rectangle has points C(0,0), D(10,0), F(10,5), E(0,5). Now, Line(C,F) is from (0,0) to (10,5), which is a diagonal. Line(D,E) is from D(10,0) to E(0,5), which is another diagonal. These two diagonals intersect at the center of the rectangle. Are they perpendicular? Let's compute their slopes. Slope of CF is (5-0)/(10-0) = 5/10 = 1/2. Slope of DE is (5-0)/(0-10) = 5/-10 = -1/2. The product of slopes is (1/2)*(-1/2) = -1/4 ≠ -1, so they are not perpendicular. Hence, this does not satisfy the perpendicular condition.

But the predicate says Perpendicular(Line(C,F), Line(D,E)), which in this case is not true. So this configuration doesn't work.

Another possibility: Line(C,F) is a side and Line(D,E) is a diagonal. Let me try. Suppose in the rectangle CDEF, Line(C,F) is a side, and Line(D,E) is a diagonal. For example, if CDEF is a rectangle with C(0,0), D(10,0), E(10,5), F(0,5). Then, Line(C,F) is the side from (0,0) to (0,5), vertical. Line(D,E) is from D(10,0) to E(10,5), also vertical. These are parallel, not perpendicular. No good.

Alternatively, if Line(D,E) is a diagonal from D(10,0) to E(0,5). Then, Line(C,F) is from C(0,0) to F(x,y). For these to be perpendicular, their slopes must multiply to -1. Let me assume F is at (0,5), so Line(C,F) is vertical. Line(D,E) is from (10,0) to (0,5), slope is (5-0)/(0-10) = -1/2. Vertical line has undefined slope, so they are not perpendicular. No.

Alternatively, if Line(C,F) is horizontal. Let me say F is at (5,0), but then CF would be horizontal, and Line(D,E) needs to be perpendicular. But this changes the length of CF. Original given says Length(C,F) is 5, so if CF is horizontal from (0,0) to (5,0), then D would need to be somewhere... This is getting too convoluted.

Maybe I need to abandon the coordinate system and think differently. Let's focus on the given lengths and relationships.

We have a rectangle CDEF with CD = 10, CF = 5. So, if CD and CF are adjacent sides, then the rectangle has sides 10 and 5, area 50. But the problem asks for the area of the shaded region, which might involve circles.

The circles are Circle(A) and Circle(H). Line(A,E) is a radius of Circle(A), so AE is a radius. Similarly, Line(H,B) is a radius of Circle(H), so HB is a radius.

Assuming that E is a point on the rectangle, maybe E is one of the vertices. If E is a vertex, and AE is a radius, then A is the center of Circle(A), and E is on the circle. Similarly for H and B.

If E is a vertex of the rectangle, say E is the top-right corner, then the center A of Circle(A) would be somewhere such that AE is the radius. Similarly, B is on Circle(H) with center H.

But without knowing where A and B are, it's hard to proceed. Maybe the circles are tangent to the rectangle or intersect it?

Alternatively, perhaps the shaded region is the area inside the rectangle but outside the circles, or vice versa. Let me think about possible scenarios.

If the circles are inscribed within the rectangle, their areas would be subtracted. Or if they overlap, the intersection area would be involved. But without a diagram, it's challenging, but maybe the problem assumes standard configurations.

Let me assume that Circle(A) has center at A, and E is on the circle. Similarly, Circle(H) has center at H, and B is on the circle. If E is a vertex of the rectangle, then AE is the radius. Let me calculate the radius of Circle(A): since AE is a radius, and E is a point on the rectangle. If E is at (10,5) in the previous coordinate system, then the distance from A to E is the radius. But where is A?

Similarly, for Circle(H), the radius is HB, with B on the circle.

But without knowing the position of A and B, it's difficult. However, maybe these circles are related to the rectangle's dimensions.

Let me think: if AE is a radius, and E is a vertex of the rectangle, then the radius of Circle(A) could be related to the rectangle's sides. For instance, if E is at (10,5), and A is somewhere inside the rectangle, then AE would be the radius. But without more info, it's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the circles are tangent to the rectangle's sides? Or maybe they're centered at certain points?

Alternatively, since Line(A,E) is a radius, and Line(C,D) is 10, Line(C,F) is 5, perhaps there's a relationship between these lengths and the circles' radii.

For example, if Line(C,F) is 5, and it's a radius, then the radius of Circle(H) is 5? Wait, Line(H,B) is a radius of Circle(H), so HB = radius. But Line(C,F) is length 5, but it's not stated to be a radius. So unless there's a connection between Line(C,F) and the circles.

Wait, maybe Line(A,E) is the same as Line(C,F)? No, because Line(A,E) is a radius of Circle(A), and Line(C,F) is a side of the rectangle with length 5. So if Line(A,E) is equal to Line(C,F), then the radius of Circle(A) is 5. Similarly, if Line(H,B) is equal to Line(C,D), which is 10, then the radius of Circle(H) is 10.

But why would Line(A,E) be equal to Line(C,F)? It depends on the positioning of A and E. For example, if A is at point C, then Line(A,E) would be Line(C,E), whose length would depend on where E is. If E is at (10,5), then Length(C,E) would be sqrt(10^2 + 5^2) = sqrt(125) ≈ 11.18, which is not 5. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if A is at point F, then Line(A,E) is Line(F,E), which is a side of the rectangle, length 10. But the given length of Line(C,F) is 5, so that would mean CF = 5, which matches if F is at (0,5) and C at (0,0). But then Line(F,E) would be from (0,5) to (10,5), which is 10 units, matching the length of CD. So if Line(A,E) is this 10-unit length, then the radius of Circle(A) is 10. Similarly, if Line(H,B) is a radius, perhaps it's related to the other side.

But this is speculative. Let me try to proceed.

Assume that Circle(A) has radius 10 (if Line(A,E) is the side of the rectangle). Then, Area of Circle(A) is π*(10)^2 = 100π. Similarly, if Line(H,B) is the other side, length 5, then radius is 5, area is 25π. But the shaded region might be the area of the rectangle minus the areas of the circles. But then, the area would be 50 - (100π + 25π) = 50 - 125π, which is negative, which doesn't make sense. So likely not.

Alternatively, the shaded region could be the area of the circles inside the rectangle. If the circles are partially inside, but without knowing their positions, it's hard to tell.

Wait, perhaps the circles are tangent to the rectangle at certain points. For example, Circle(A) is tangent to the rectangle at E, and Circle(H) is tangent at B. If E is a vertex, then the circle's center would be at a distance equal to the radius from E.

For instance, if Circle(A) has radius r_A, and is tangent to the rectangle at E, then the center A is at a distance r_A from E. Similarly for Circle(H).

But without knowing where A and B are, it's challenging. Let me try to use the given lengths.

We know that Line(C,D) is 10, Line(C,F) is 5. If these are sides of the rectangle, then the rectangle has sides 10 and 5, area 50. If the shaded region is this area minus the areas of the circles, but we need to find the radii of the circles.

From the predicates:

IsRadiusOf(Line(H,B), Circle(H)) → HB is the radius of Circle(H).

IsRadiusOf(Line(A,E), Circle(A)) → AE is the radius of Circle(A).

If we can find the lengths of AE and HB, we can calculate the areas of the circles.

But how?

Perhaps AE is related to the rectangle's sides. For example, if E is a vertex of the rectangle, and A is another point such that AE is a radius.

Let me assume that E is a vertex of the rectangle, say E is at (10,5). Then, if A is somewhere such that AE is a radius. If A is at point C, then AE would be the diagonal from C(0,0) to E(10,5), which has length sqrt(10^2 + 5^2) = sqrt(125) ≈ 11.18. But this is not directly helpful.

Alternatively, if A is at point D, then AE would be from D(10,0) to E(10,5), which is length 5. So if Line(A,E) is this 5-unit length, then the radius of Circle(A) is 5. Similarly, if Line(H,B) is another length, say 10, then the radius of Circle(H) is 10.

If that's the case, then the area of Circle(A) is π*(5)^2 = 25π, and Circle(H) is π*(10)^2 = 100π. Total area of circles is 125π. But the area of the rectangle is 50. Subtracting gives 50 - 125π, which is negative, so that can't be the shaded region. Hence, this suggests that the shaded region might be the area of the circles, or the intersection, or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the shaded region is the area of the rectangle minus the areas of the circles, but only parts of the circles are inside the rectangle. For example, if the circles are partially inside, then the shaded area would be 50 - (area of parts of circles inside the rectangle). But without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to calculate.

Wait, perhaps the circles are fully inside the rectangle? For example, if Circle(A) has radius 5, and is centered at a point such that it fits entirely within the rectangle. If the rectangle has width 10 and height 5, then a circle with diameter equal to the smaller side (5) would fit. So if Circle(A) has radius 5, it would touch the top and bottom of the rectangle. Similarly, Circle(H) with radius 10 would extend beyond the rectangle, so only part of it is inside. This seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the circles are positioned such that their centers are at the midpoints of the rectangle's sides. For example, Circle(A) has center at midpoint of CD, which is at (5,0), and radius 5. Then, the circle would extend from x=0 to x=10, y=0 to y=5, fitting perfectly. Similarly, Circle(H) might be at midpoint of CF, which is at (0, 2.5), with radius 2.5, but then Line(H,B) would be a radius of 2.5. But this is just speculation.

However, the given Line(C,F) has length 5, so if CF is 5, and if Circle(H) has radius equal to CF, then HB = 5. If H is at point C, then Line(H,B) would be CB, and B would be 5 units from C. But without knowing where B is, it's hard to say.

At this point, I realize that without knowing the exact positions of A and B, it's very difficult to calculate the shaded area. However, given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, maybe I should look for another approach.

Let me revisit the initial given data and see if I missed anything.

We have a rectangle CDEF with CD = 10, CF = 5. The sides CD and CF are perpendicular, as they are adjacent sides of the rectangle. So, the rectangle has sides 10 and 5, area 50. The circles are Circle(A) and Circle(H), with radii AE and HB respectively.

If the shaded region is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the circles, but since we don't know the radii, perhaps we can find them from the given information.

Wait, Line(A,E) is a radius of Circle(A), so AE is the radius. If E is a vertex of the rectangle, and A is another point, perhaps A is one of the other vertices? For example, if A is point C, then AE would be CE, which is the diagonal of the rectangle. The length of CE is sqrt(10^2 + 5^2) = sqrt(125) ≈ 11.18. So radius of Circle(A) would be 11.18. Similarly, if Line(H,B) is a radius, and B is another point, say D, then HB would be HD, which is the distance from H to D. But without knowing H's location, this is uncertain.

Alternatively, perhaps A and H are points on the rectangle. For example, A is the midpoint of CD, and E is a vertex. Then, AE would be the distance from midpoint of CD to E. Let me calculate that.

If C is at (0,0), D at (10,0), E at (10,5), F at (0,5). Midpoint of CD is (5,0). Distance from (5,0) to E(10,5) is sqrt((10-5)^2 + (5-0)^2) = sqrt(25 + 25) = sqrt(50) ≈ 7.07. So radius of Circle(A) would be sqrt(50). Similarly, if H is at some other point...

But this is too many assumptions. Given that the problem provides answer choices, and the area of the rectangle is 50, which is one of the options (option D), but the shaded area might be less than that. If the shaded area is the area of the rectangle minus the area of one circle, say Circle(A) with radius 5 (as in earlier guess), then 50 - π*5^2 ≈ 50 - 78.54 = -28.54, which is invalid. If it's the area of the circle inside the rectangle, then if the circle has radius 5, and is placed such that it fits, then area would be π*5^2 = 78.54, which is larger than 50, so again invalid.

Alternatively, if the shaded region is the area of the circle with radius 5 (assuming Line(C,F) is the radius), then 78.54, but none of the options are close to that. The options are around 10.7, 19.6, 30.4, 50.0. 50.0 is option D, which is the area of the rectangle. Maybe the shaded region is the area of the rectangle, so answer D? But that seems unlikely, as the question specifies a shaded region, implying it's not the whole rectangle.

Wait, maybe the shaded region is the area of the circle with radius 5 (from Line(C,F)) and another circle with radius 10 (from Line(C,D))? But that would give total area 25π + 100π = 125π ≈ 392.7, which is way higher than the options.

Alternatively, maybe the shaded region is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the circle with radius 5. So 50 - 25π ≈ 50 - 78.54 = -28.54, which is impossible. 

Alternatively, if the shaded region is the area of the circle with radius 5, but only a portion is inside the rectangle. For example, if the circle is centered at C, with radius 5, then it would extend from C(0,0) to F(0,5), and possibly into the rectangle. The area inside the rectangle would be a quarter-circle, area (1/4)*π*5^2 = 12.5π ≈ 39.27, which is closer to option C (30.4) or B (19.6). But this is still not matching.

Alternatively, if there are two circles, each with radius 5 and 10, and the shaded region is their intersection. But without knowing their positions, it's hard to calculate.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the shaded region is the area common to both circles and the rectangle. If Circle(A) has radius 5 and is centered at C, and Circle(H) has radius 10 and is centered at D, then the intersection area would be complex. But this is too vague.

Given the time I've invested and the lack of progress, perhaps I should consider that the shaded region is the area of the rectangle minus the area of one circle, and choose the closest option. If the area of the rectangle is 50, and if the circle has radius 5, then 50 - 25π ≈ 50 - 78.54 = -28.54, which is invalid. If the circle has radius 10, area is 100π ≈ 314, which is much larger. 

Alternatively, maybe the shaded region is the area of the circle with radius 5, which is 25π ≈ 78.54, but this is not among the options. The closest option is D (50.0), which is the area of the rectangle. Maybe the shaded region is the rectangle itself, but that seems odd.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the rectangle's area is 50. Let me double-check. If CD is 10 and CF is 5, and they are perpendicular, then the area is indeed 10*5 = 50. But if the shaded region is the area of the rectangle, then answer D. But why would the question ask for it? Maybe the shaded region is the rectangle, and the answer is D. But this seems too straightforward, and the presence of circles suggests otherwise.

Alternatively, perhaps the shaded region is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the circle with radius 5 (from Line(C,F)), giving 50 - 25π ≈ 50 - 78.54 = -28.54, which is impossible, so maybe it's the area of the circle inside the rectangle, which would be a semicircle or something. If the circle is half inside, area would be 12.5π ≈ 39.27, which is not an option. 

Looking at the options, 30.4 is close to 30.4, which is approximately 9.7π (since π ≈ 3.14, 9.7*3.14 ≈ 30.4). So if the shaded area is 9.7π, that would be 30.4, which is option C. How can this happen?

If the shaded region is a segment of a circle. For example, if there's a circle with radius 5, and the shaded area is a sector or segment. Let me think. If the circle has radius 5, and the shaded area is a quarter-circle, then area is (1/4)*π*5^2 = 12.5π ≈ 39.27, not matching. If it's a semi-circle, 1/2*π*5^2 = 12.5π ≈ 39.27. Still not matching.

Wait, 30.4 is roughly 9.7π. Let me calculate 9.7*3.14 ≈ 30.4. So if the shaded area is 9.7π, but how?

Maybe it's the area of a circle with radius 3, since π*3^2 = 9π ≈ 28.27, close to 30.4. Or radius 3.1, which would be π*3.1^2 ≈ 3.14*9.61 ≈ 30.0. Close to 30.4. But how to get this radius?

Alternatively, if the shaded region is the area of the rectangle minus the area of two semicircles. Let's say each semicircle has radius 5 and 10. But this is too vague.

Alternatively, the shaded region is the area of the rectangle minus the area of a semicircle with radius 5. 50 - (1/2)*π*5^2 = 50 - 12.5π ≈ 50 - 39.27 = 10.73, which is close to option A (10.7). This is possible!

Let me check: if the shaded region is the area of the rectangle minus a semicircle with radius 5, then 50 - 12.5π ≈ 50 - 39.27 = 10.73, which rounds to 10.7, option A. This fits!

How did I arrive at this? Well, if one of the circles has radius 5 (from Line(C,F)), and it's a semicircle inside the rectangle. For example, if the circle is centered at C, with radius 5, then it would form a
