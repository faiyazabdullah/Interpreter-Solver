MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

So, the problem mentions several angle measures and some congruences. Let me note them down:

Angles:
- Measure of Angle(J, L, M) is 25 degrees.
- Measure of Angle(M, L, K) is 20 degrees.
- Measure of Angle(K, L, J) is 18 degrees.
- Measure of Angle(J, K, L) is 18 degrees.

Congruences:
- Line JK is congruent to Line KN.
- Line NK is congruent to Line MN? Wait, wait. Wait, the third congruence says Congruent(Line(N,K), Line(M,N)). So Line NK ≅ Line MN?

Wait, let me check again. The user wrote:

- Congruent(Line(J,K), Line(K,N)) → So JK ≅ KN.
- Congruent(Line(N,M), Line(M,L)) → NM ≅ ML?
Wait, Line(N,M) is same as Line(M,N). So Line NM ≅ Line ML? Or maybe it's Line(N,M) ≅ Line(M,L)? Wait, original says:

"Congruent(Line(N,M), Line(M,L))". So Line NM is congruent to Line ML. So that would mean NM ≅ ML. Similarly, another congruence: "Congruent(Line(N,K), Line(M,N))" → Line NK ≅ Line MN. So Line NK ≅ Line MN.

Also, points L lies on Line JK and on Line MN. So point L is the intersection of lines JK and MN.

Now, the question asks about triangles KLN and LMN being isosceles, and that angle JKN is 130 degrees. Need to find measure of angle J.

Let me sketch this mentally. Points J, K, L, M, N. Since L is on both JK and MN, so lines JK and MN intersect at L.

Given that JK ≅ KN, and NM ≅ ML, and NK ≅ MN. Wait, perhaps there are some congruent sides here.

First, let's consider triangle JKL. Wait, but we have angles given involving points J, L, M, K, etc.

But first, since L is on line JK, then line JK passes through L. Also, L is on line MN. Therefore, lines JK and MN intersect at L.

So, points J, K, L are colinear with L between J and K? Or maybe not necessarily. Wait, since L is on line JK, but depending on where L is located. But also, L is on line MN. So MN intersects JK at L.

Additionally, we have congruences: JK ≅ KN, so segment JK equals segment KN. And NM ≅ ML. Also, NK ≅ MN. Wait, if NK ≅ MN, then since NK is part of the line from N to K, and MN is from M to N. So maybe triangle NKM has some properties?

Alternatively, maybe considering triangles involving these congruent sides.

Also, given that triangles KLN and LMN are isosceles. So triangle KLN has two equal sides, and triangle LMN has two equal sides.

Let me try to draw this mentally. Let me think about the points:

Points J, K, L, M, N. With L being the intersection of JK and MN.

Since JK ≅ KN, so length JK = length KN. So starting from point J, going to K, then from K to N such that KN equals JK. Then, NM ≅ ML. So from N to M equals from M to L. Also, NK ≅ MN. So from N to K equals from M to N. Wait, that would imply that NK = MN, so from earlier, since JK = KN, then JK = MN. And since NM = ML, then MN = ML. Therefore, JK = MN = ML = KN.

So, maybe there's a series of congruent segments here.

Let me try to see if I can find coordinates or relations between the points.

Alternatively, since there are angles given, maybe focus on those.

First, looking at the angles:

Angle at J-L-M is 25°, so ∠JLM = 25°? Wait, angle J, L, M would be angle at L between J and M. So ∠JLK? Wait, the angle measure is written as MeasureOf(Angle(J,L,M)) which is angle at L, with segments JL and LM. So ∠JLM = 25°.

Similarly, MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)) is 20°, so angle at L between M and K, i.e., ∠MLK = 20°.

MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,J)) is 18°, which is angle at L between K and J, i.e., ∠KLJ = 18°.

MeasureOf(Angle(J,K,L)) is 18°, which is angle at K between J and L, so ∠JKL = 18°.

Wait, but angle at K between J and L. So in triangle JKL, angle at K is 18°, angle at L is ... Well, from previous, ∠JLM is 25°, which is angle at L between J and M. Hmm, but how does that fit?

Wait, maybe I should consider triangle JKL. In triangle JKL, angles at J, K, L. Wait, but we know angle at K (∠JKL) is 18°, and angle at L (∠JLK) would be... Let me think.

Wait, point L is on line JK. Wait, hold on! If L is on line JK, then triangle JKL is degenerate? Because points J, L, K are colinear. That would make angle at L zero? But that contradicts the given angle measures. Wait, this suggests that my understanding is wrong.

Wait, hold on. Maybe I misread the angle measures. Let me re-examine the given angle measures.

Original angles:

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(J,L,M)), 25): This is angle at L between J and M. So ∠JLM = 25°.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)), 20): angle at L between M and K: ∠MLK = 20°.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,J)), 18): angle at L between K and J: ∠KLJ = 18°.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(J,K,L)), 18): angle at K between J and L: ∠JKL = 18°.

Wait, but if L is on line JK, then points J, L, K are colinear, making ∠JKL undefined because it would be a straight line. However, the given angle ∠JKL is 18°, implying that it's a valid angle. Therefore, my assumption that L is between J and K must be incorrect. Instead, maybe L is not between J and K, but outside?

Wait, but the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(L, Line(J,K)), which means L is somewhere along line JK, but not necessarily between J and K. For example, L could be extended beyond K or beyond J.

Ah, okay. So line JK extends infinitely in both directions, and L is a point on that line, possibly extending beyond K or J. So for instance, if L is beyond K, then the order would be J---K---L. Or if L is beyond J, then L---J---K. 

This changes things. So, for example, if L is beyond K, then angle at K between J and L would be formed. Let me try to imagine that.

Assume that L is beyond K on line JK. So the order is J---K---L. Then, angle ∠JKL is the angle at K between J and L. Since J, K, L are colinear, that angle would be 180°, but the given measure is 18°, which doesn't fit. Hence, this suggests that L is not on the extension of JK beyond K. Alternatively, if L is on the other side, say beyond J. So the order is L---J---K. Then, angle ∠JKL is still a straight line? No, because if L is beyond J, then from point K, looking towards J and L, the angle between KJ and KL would be 180° minus something. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Actually, if L is on line JK, but not between J and K, then the angle ∠JKL would depend on the position of L. Suppose L is on the line JK extended beyond K. Then, from point K, the segments KJ and KL are in opposite directions. So angle between KJ and KL would be 180°, but that contradicts the given 18°. Hence, this suggests that L is not on the line JK extended beyond K or J. Wait, but the predicate states that L is on line JK. How can that be?

Wait, unless the line JK is not straight? No, lines are straight by definition. So there's a contradiction here. Unless there's a misunderstanding in interpreting the angles.

Wait, maybe the angles are not in the way I thought. Let me recheck the notation. Angle(J,L,M) is the angle at L between points J, L, M. So vertex at L, with segments LJ and LM. Similarly, angle(M,L,K) is at L between M and K, so segments LM and LK. Angle(K,L,J) is at L between K and J, so segments LK and LJ. Angle(J,K,L) is at K between J and L, so segments KJ and KL. 

So, if L is on line JK, then for angle ∠JKL (at K between J and L), that would require that L is not on line JK. Wait, no—if L is on line JK, then the angle between KJ and KL would be a straight line if L is on the line. Wait, this seems impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my interpretation.

Wait, perhaps the angle is not formed by the points as I thought. Let me recall that angle ABC is the angle at point B between points A, B, C. So, angle JKL is the angle at K between J and L. So, if L is on line JK, then the points J, K, L are colinear, so angle JKL would be a straight angle (180°), which contradicts the given 18°. Therefore, this implies that my initial assumption is wrong—that L is not on line JK. But the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(L, Line(J,K)). So there's a contradiction here. 

Wait, this must mean that I'm misinterpreting the notation. Perhaps the angle is not at the middle letter. Wait, no—standard notation is angle ABC is at B. So angle JKL is at K. So if L is on line JK, then angle JKL would be a straight angle. But the given measure is 18°, so that's impossible. Therefore, there's a conflict. 

Hmm. This suggests that either there's a misinterpretation of the predicates, or perhaps the diagram isn't Euclidean? Or maybe the points are arranged differently. Wait, perhaps L is not on line JK but on line MN? Wait, the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(L, Line(J,K)) and PointLiesOnLine(L, Line(M,N)). So L is on both lines JK and MN. Therefore, L is the intersection point of lines JK and MN. Thus, lines JK and MN intersect at L. 

Therefore, points J, K are on one line, and M, N are on another line, intersecting at L. So, L is the intersection of lines JK and MN. So, in this case, lines JK and MN cross at L. So, L is not necessarily between J and K, nor between M and N. It depends on the configuration.

So, for example, lines JK and MN intersect at L, forming various angles around L. Now, the angles given involve L, so we can consider the angles around point L.

For example, angle J-L-M is 25°, which is the angle between lines LJ and LM. Similarly, angle M-L-K is 20°, angle between LM and LK. Angle K-L-J is 18°, between LK and LJ. And angle J-K-L is 18°, which is at point K between J and L. 

Wait, but angle J-K-L is at K between J and L. So, if we look at point K, connected to J and L. Since L is on line JK, then KL is part of line JK. So, angle at K between J and L would be a straight angle (if L is on the line), but again, the given measure is 18°, which suggests that L is not on the line JK. But the predicate says it is. There's a contradiction here. 

Unless... Oh! Wait, maybe the angle is not formed by the collinear points. Wait, if L is on line JK, then segment KL is part of line JK. So, from point K, drawing to L (which is on line JK), so segment KL is just a part of line JK. Then, the angle at K between J and L would be zero degrees if L is on the line. But the given measure is 18°, which is conflicting. 

This suggests that my understanding is wrong. Maybe the angle J-K-L refers to something else. Wait, maybe the angle is not formed by the segments KL and KJ, but by different segments. Wait, no—the standard notation is that angle J-K-L is the angle at K between points J and L. So, the segments KJ and KL form the angle at K. 

But if L is on line JK, then KL is a continuation of KJ. Hence, the angle between KJ and KL is 180°, not 18°. Therefore, there's a contradiction. 

This indicates that there's a fundamental error in my interpretation. Let me double-check the problem statement.

The problem gives:

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(J,L,M)), 25)

Which is angle at L between J and M.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)), 20): angle at L between M and K.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,J)), 18): angle at L between K and J.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(J,K,L)), 18): angle at K between J and L.

Wait, but if L is on line JK, then angle at K between J and L would be a straight angle. So why is it 18°? This suggests that L is not on line JK. But the predicate says it is. 

There's a paradox here. Perhaps the problem involves non-Euclidean geometry? Or maybe the lines are not straight? But the problem mentions lines, which are typically straight. 

Wait, maybe the angle J-K-L is not referring to the angle at K, but at J? No, standard notation is angle ABC is at B. So angle J-K-L is at K. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is formed by different segments. For example, maybe the angle is at L, but that's not the case. 

Alternatively, could there be a typo in the problem? Or perhaps I'm missing something. 

Alternatively, perhaps the point L is not on line JK but on line MN, but the predicate says it is on both lines. 

Wait, the problem states:

PointLiesOnLine(L, Line(J,K)) and PointLiesOnLine(L, Line(M,N)). So L is on both lines, hence the intersection point. 

Thus, lines JK and MN intersect at L. 

Now, the angles given involve L. Let me try to visualize this setup. Imagine two lines intersecting at L: one line is JK, and the other is MN. At point L, there are four angles formed by the intersection of lines JK and MN. 

Now, the angles mentioned:

∠J-L-M is 25°: this is one of the angles at L between J and M. 

∠M-L-K is 20°: angle at L between M and K. 

∠K-L-J is 18°: angle at L between K and J. 

∠J-K-L is 18°: angle at K between J and L. 

Wait, but if lines JK and MN intersect at L, then at point L, the vertical angles would be equal. For example, if line JK and line MN intersect at L, then the angles around L would sum to 360°. 

Let me denote the angles around L. Let's call the four angles at L:

1. Between J and M: ∠JLM = 25°
2. Between M and K: ∠MLK = 20°
3. Between K and J: ∠KLJ = 18°
4. The fourth angle, which would be supplementary to the others?

Wait, but adding up these three angles: 25 + 20 + 18 = 63°, which leaves 360 - 63 = 297° for the remaining angle. That doesn't seem right. Wait, but angles around a point sum to 360°, so if three angles are given, the fourth is determined. 

But let me think again. When two lines intersect, they form two pairs of vertical angles. So, if one pair is 25° and 20°, then the other pair would be supplementary? Wait, no. Wait, suppose lines JK and MN intersect at L. Then, the adjacent angles would be supplementary. 

But the given angles are:

At point L, between J and M: 25°, between M and K: 20°, between K and J: 18°. Wait, but if you go around the point L, the angles should add up to 360°. So, if we have three angles given, their sum plus the fourth angle equals 360. Let me calculate:

25° + 20° + 18° = 63°, so the fourth angle is 360 - 63 = 297°, which is impossible because angles around a point cannot exceed 180° in standard cases unless it's a reflex angle. But reflex angles are greater than 180°, so technically possible. But this seems odd. 

However, the presence of the angle ∠JKL = 18°, which is at point K between J and L, complicates things. 

Wait, perhaps I need to consider triangle KLM or something. Let me think about the triangles involved. 

Triangles KLN and LMN are isosceles. So, triangle KLN has two equal sides, and triangle LMN also has two equal sides. 

Also, the congruences:

- JK ≅ KN: so JK = KN
- NM ≅ ML: so NM = ML
- NK ≅ MN: so NK = MN

Wait, if NK = MN, and from above, NM = ML, then NK = MN = ML. Also, since JK = NK, then JK = MN = ML. 

This suggests that segments JK, KN, MN, ML are all equal in length. 

Let me try to build this step by step. 

Starting with point J, K, L, M, N. Lines JK and MN intersect at L. 

From the congruences:

- JK = KN (since JK ≅ KN)
- NM = ML (NM ≅ ML)
- NK = MN (NK ≅ MN)

So, since NK = MN and NM = ML, then NK = MN = ML. Also, JK = NK, so JK = MN = ML. 

Let me assume that JK = KN = x. Then, MN = x as well, and ML = x. 

Now, considering the angles around point L. Let me try to find relationships between the angles. 

At point L, the angles are:

∠JLM = 25°, ∠MLK = 20°, ∠KLJ = 18°, and the fourth angle, which I'll call ∠NLK or whatever. 

Wait, but if lines JK and MN intersect at L, then the angles around L are formed by the intersection. Let me think of them as follows: 

When two lines intersect, they form two pairs of vertical angles. Let's say line JK passes through L, and line MN also passes through L. So, the angles around L would be:

- Between J and M: ∠JLM = 25°
- Between M and K: ∠MLK = 20°
- Between K and N: ?
- Between N and J: ?

Wait, but the given angles are ∠JLM = 25°, ∠MLK = 20°, ∠KLJ = 18°. Wait, ∠KLJ is at L between K and J, which would be the angle between LK and LJ. Which is the same as the angle between LK and LJ, which is supplementary to the angle between JK and MN. 

Wait, this is getting too confusing without a diagram. Maybe I need to use the fact that triangles KLN and LMN are isosceles. 

Triangle KLN is isosceles. So, either KL = LN, or KL = KN, or KN = LN. Similarly for triangle LMN. 

But we know from the congruences that KN = JK, and MN = ML. Also, NK = MN. 

Let me try to analyze triangle KLN. If it's isosceles, then two of its sides are equal. Possible options:

Case 1: KL = LN
Case 2: KL = KN
Case 3: KN = LN

Similarly for triangle LMN: sides LM = LN, or LM = MN, or MN = LN.

But from the congruences, we have:

- KN = JK
- MN = ML
- NK = MN ⇒ KN = MN = ML

So, KN = MN = ML. Also, JK = KN ⇒ JK = MN = ML. 

Let me try to find lengths. Assume JK = KN = MN = ML = x. 

Now, considering triangle KLN. If it's isosceles, then two sides must be equal. Let's suppose that KL = KN. If KL = KN = x, then triangle KLN has sides KL = KN = x, making it isosceles with base LN. Alternatively, if KN = LN, then triangle KLN is isosceles with legs KN and LN. 

But we need more information to determine which sides are equal. 

Alternatively, perhaps using the angles. Given that certain angles are known, we can use the Law of Sines or Cosines in triangles. 

But first, let's try to find the angles at point L. 

Earlier, I had the angles around L summing to 360°. Let me try again. 

At point L, the angles formed by the intersecting lines JK and MN are:

1. Between J and M: ∠JLM = 25°
2. Between M and K: ∠MLK = 20°
3. Between K and N: ? 
4. Between N and J: ? 

But also, we have ∠KLJ = 18°, which is the angle at L between K and J. Wait, that would be the angle between LK and LJ, which is adjacent to the angle between J and M. 

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to label all angles around point L. 

Imagine lines JK and MN intersecting at L. Let me name the four angles around L as follows:

- α: between J and M (given as 25°)
- β: between M and K (given as 20°)
- γ: between K and N (?)
- δ: between N and J (?)

These four angles should add up to 360°, so α + β + γ + δ = 360°.

We know α = 25°, β = 20°, but what about γ and δ? 

Additionally, we have ∠KLJ = 18°, which is the angle at L between K and J. This would be the angle between LK and LJ, which is the angle between the segments from L to K and L to J. 

Since L is the intersection of lines JK and MN, the angle between LK and LJ is actually the angle between the extensions of the lines. Wait, but if L is on line JK, then LJ and LK are parts of the same line. Hence, the angle between them should be 180°, but we're told it's 18°. This contradiction suggests that my understanding is flawed. 

Perhaps the angle ∠KLJ is not between LK and LJ, but something else. Wait, no—∠KLJ is at point L between K and J, so it should be between LK and LJ. 

This brings us back to the same contradiction. 

Maybe the issue is that the lines are not straight? Or perhaps the points are arranged in a different way. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle ∠JKL = 18° refers to a different angle. Let me re-express that. 

∠JKL is the angle at K between J and L. Since K is on line JK, and L is on line JK, then segment KL is part of line JK. Hence, the angle at K between J and L is a straight angle (180°), but it's given as 18°. This is impossible. 

Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the angle. Perhaps the angle is not at K, but at J? No, the notation is angle J-K-L, which is at K. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is formed by different segments. Like, instead of KJ and KL, it's KJ and KM? But that's not indicated. 

I think there's a fundamental flaw in the problem setup, or perhaps I'm missing something crucial. 

Wait, let me consider that maybe the angle ∠JKL is not a straight angle because L is not on line JK. But the predicate says it is. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves three-dimensional geometry, but that's unlikely. 

Alternatively, maybe the lines are not straight, but that's against standard definitions. 

Given that this is a math competition-style problem, and assuming it's solvable, I must have made a wrong assumption. Let me try to proceed differently. 

Let me forget about the angles for a moment and focus on the congruences and the isosceles triangles. 

Given that triangles KLN and LMN are isosceles. Also, from the congruences:

- JK ≅ KN
- NM ≅ ML
- NK ≅ MN

So, KN = JK, MN = ML, and NK = MN. Hence, KN = MN = ML = JK. 

Let me consider triangle KLN. Since it's isosceles, two sides are equal. Let's assume that KL = KN. Since KN = JK, then KL = JK. 

If KL = JK, then triangle JKL has sides JK = KL, making it isosceles with base JL. 

But we also have angle ∠JKL = 18°, which is at K. In triangle JKL, if JK = KL, then the base angles at J and L are equal. Wait, but ∠JKL is at K, so the apex angle. 

In triangle JKL, if JK = KL, then ∠JKL = 18°, and the other two angles are equal. Let me compute them. 

Sum of angles in triangle is 180°. So, ∠JKL + ∠KJL + ∠KLJ = 180°. 

If ∠JKL = 18°, and ∠KJL = ∠KLJ. Let me denote them as x. 

Then, 18 + x + x = 180 → 2x = 162 → x = 81°. So, ∠KJL = 81°, ∠KLJ = 81°. 

But from the given, we have ∠KLJ = 18°, which contradicts this. Hence, our assumption that KL = KN is wrong. 

So, triangle KLN is isosceles. Let's try another possibility: KN = LN. Since KN = JK, then LN = JK. 

Or, KL = LN. 

Let me explore KN = LN. So, in triangle KLN, KN = LN, making it isosceles with base KL. 

Then, ∠KLN = ∠KLN? Wait, the base angles would be at K and N. Wait, if KN = LN, then the base is KL, and the equal sides are KN and LN. Hence, the base angles at K and N are equal. 

So, ∠KLN = ∠KNL. 

But we don't know the angles yet. 

Alternatively, maybe KL = LN. 

But without knowing which sides are equal, it's hard to proceed. 

Let me consider the other triangle, LMN, which is isosceles. From the congruences, we have NM = ML, so triangle LMN has sides NM = ML. Hence, it's isosceles with equal sides NL and ML? Or ML and MN? 

Wait, triangle LMN has vertices L, M, N. If NM = ML, then sides LM and MN are equal. Hence, triangle LMN is isosceles with legs LM and MN, so the base is LN, and the base angles at L and N are equal. 

So, ∠LMN = ∠LNM. 

But how does this help? 

Let me try to connect these ideas. 

From the congruences, MN = ML, and NK = MN, so ML = MN = NK = JK. 

Also, from the angle ∠JKL = 18°, which is at K between J and L. 

If I consider triangle JKL, with JK = KN, and ∠JKL = 18°, but earlier this led to contradictions. 

Wait, maybe I need to use the Law of Sines in triangle JKL. 

But if I assume that triangle JKL has some properties. Let me try again. 

Assume that in triangle JKL, sides JK and KL are equal, making it isosceles. Then, as before, ∠JKL = 18°, and the other angles would be (180 - 18)/2 = 81°, but this conflicts with the given ∠KLJ = 18°, which would be one of those angles. 

But the given ∠KLJ is 18°, which would be the angle at L in triangle JKL. If triangle JKL is isosceles with JK = KL, then ∠KLJ would be equal to ∠KJL. But if ∠JKL = 18°, then ∠KLJ = (180 - 18)/2 = 81°, which contradicts the given 18°. 

Hence, this suggests that triangle JKL is not isosceles. 

But we don't have information about triangle JKL being isosceles. The isosceles triangles are KLN and LMN. 

Let me return to the main goal: finding angle J, given that angle JKN is 130°. 

Wait, the question says: "m∠JKN = 130." So, angle at K between J and N is 130°. 

Let me try to use this. 

∠JKN is the angle at K between J and N. So, in terms of the diagram, this would be the angle between segments KJ and KN. 

Given that JK ≅ KN, so JK = KN. Hence, triangle JKN has sides JK = KN, making it isosceles with base JN. 

Therefore, in triangle JKN, since JK = KN, the base angles at J and N are equal. 

Let me denote ∠JKN = 130°, which is the vertex angle. Then, the base angles at J and N are (180 - 130)/2 = 25° each. 

So, ∠KJN = ∠KNJ = 25°. 

But ∠KJN is the angle at J between K and N. This might be useful. 

Now, let's try to connect this with other information. 

We also have that ∠JKN = 130°, and from earlier, we have other angles like ∠JKL = 18°, which is the angle at K between J and L. 

Wait, if ∠JKN is 130°, and ∠JKL is 18°, then the angle between LK and KN would be ∠JKN - ∠JKL = 130° - 18° = 112°. 

So, angle at K between L and N is 112°. 

Now, considering triangle KLN, which is isosceles. If we can determine which sides are equal, we can find angles. 

Assuming that triangle KLN is isosceles with KN = KL or KN = LN or KL = LN. 

But from earlier, we have KN = JK, and from the congruences, JK = KN = MN = ML. 

Let me assume that in triangle KLN, KN = KL. Since KN = JK, then KL = JK. 

If KL = JK, then triangle JKL has sides JK = KL, making it isosceles. As before, this leads to angles at J and L being equal. 

But earlier, we have ∠JKL = 18°, which would be the vertex angle. Hence, the base angles at J and L would be (180 - 18)/2 = 81°. 

But we also have from the angle ∠KLJ = 18°, which is the angle at L between K and J. If this is 18°, but according to the calculation, it should be 81°, this is a contradiction. 

This suggests that our assumption is wrong. 

Alternative approach: Let's use the fact that triangle KLN is isosceles. Let's assume that it has sides KL = LN. 

If KL = LN, then in triangle KLN, the angles at K and N are equal. 

But we know angle at K between L and N is 112°, as calculated earlier. So, if ∠KLN = ∠KNL, then both are equal. 

Wait, the angle at K in triangle KLN is ∠KLN, but wait, no. In triangle KLN, the angles are at K, L, and N. 

Wait, ∠KLN is at L, between K and N. Wait, no. Let me clarify: 

In triangle KLN, the vertices are K, L, N. 

So, the angles are:

- At K: ∠LKN (between L and N)
- At L: ∠KLN (between K and N)
- At N: ∠LNK (between L and K)

If triangle KLN is isosceles, then two of these angles are equal. 

We previously found that ∠LKN (at K) is 112°, so if it's isosceles, then either ∠KLN = ∠LKN (making the triangle isosceles with sides LN = KN), or ∠LNK = ∠LKN (making sides KL = KN). 

Let's explore both possibilities.

Case 1: ∠KLN = ∠LKN = 112°. Then, the third angle at N would be 180 - 2*112 = 180 - 224 = -44°, which is impossible. 

Case 2: ∠LNK = ∠LKN = 112°, making the third angle at L equal to 180 - 2*112 = -44°, also impossible. 

Hence, this suggests that our assumption about the angle at K being 112° is wrong. 

Wait, earlier calculation: ∠JKN = 130°, and ∠JKL = 18°, so ∠LKN = ∠JKN - ∠JKL = 130 - 18 = 112°. But this assumes that ∠JKL and ∠LKN are adjacent angles at K, which might not be the case. 

Wait, let me confirm: ∠JKN is the angle at K between J and N. ∠JKL is the angle at K between J and L. So, if L is on line JK, then ∠JKL is part of ∠JKN. But if L is not on line JK, this may not hold. 

Wait, but the predicate says L is on line JK, so it must be. Hence, ∠JKL and ∠LKN are adjacent angles at K, forming ∠JKN. So, ∠JKN = ∠JKL + ∠LKN. 

Wait, but if L is on line JK, then from point K, the angle between J and L is a straight line, but we have ∠JKL = 18°, which would imply that L is not on the line. 

This is the crux of the problem. 

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps I should shift focus to the given answer choices and work backward. 

The question asks for the measure of ∠J. Given that angle JKN is 130°, and other angles are given, maybe using triangle JKN and other relations. 

From earlier, in triangle JKN, which is isosceles with JK = KN, and ∠JKN = 130°, so base angles at J and N are 25° each. So, ∠KJN = 25°. 

Now, ∠KJN is the angle at J between K and N. This might be part of larger angles. 

Also, we have other angles given: ∠JLM = 25°, ∠MLK = 20°, ∠KLJ = 18°, ∠JKL = 18°. 

Wait, if ∠KJN = 25°, and ∠KLJ = 18°, maybe these angles are related. 

Let me consider point J, with angles at J. We have ∠KJN = 25°, and possibly other angles. 

If I can find other angles at J, I can find ∠J. 

Alternatively, considering the full angle at J. 

But without a clear diagram, it's challenging. 

Another idea: Since triangles KLN and LMN are isosceles, and we have congruences, maybe we can find relationships between the angles. 

From earlier, in triangle LMN, since ML = MN, it is isosceles with base LN. Hence, ∠LMN = ∠LNM. 

But ∠LMN is the angle at M between L and N. 

Also, from the congruences, ML = MN = x, and from the angles around L, perhaps we can find relationships. 

But I'm stuck. Let me try to summarize what I know:

- Triangle JKN is isosceles with JK = KN, ∠JKN = 130°, so ∠KJN = ∠KNJ = 25°.

- ∠KLJ = 18°, which is at L between K and J.

- ∠JKL = 18°, at K between J and L.

- ∠JLM = 25°, at L between J and M.

- ∠MLK = 20°, at L between M and K.

- ∠KLM = ? 

Wait, maybe using the angles around point L. 

At point L, the angles are:

- ∠JLM = 25°
- ∠MLK = 20°
- ∠KLJ = 18°
- The fourth angle, let's call it ∠NLK = ?

Sum of these should be 360°. So:

25 + 20 + 18 + ∠NLK = 360 → ∠NLK = 360 - 63 = 297°. This is a reflex angle, which is possible. 

But how does this help? 

If ∠NLK is 297°, then the actual angle inside the triangle would be 360 - 297 = 63°, but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the reflex angle is considered, but in standard geometry, angles are measured as the smallest possible. 

This is getting too tangled. Let me try to use the isosceles triangles. 

Triangle KLN is isosceles. Let's assume that it has sides KL = LN. 

If KL = LN, then ∠KLN = ∠KNL. 

But ∠KLN is at L between K and N, which is part of the 297° reflex angle. 

Alternatively, if the triangle is isosceles with KL = KN, then ∠KLN = ∠KNL. 

But without knowing which sides are equal, it's hard to proceed. 

Given the time I've invested and the lack of progress, I'll try to make educated guesses based on the given choices and the information I have. 

From triangle JKN, ∠KJN = 25°. This might be part of a larger angle at J. 

If ∠KJN = 25°, and there's another angle at J, say ∠JMN or something, then total ∠J would be the sum. 

But I need more info. 

Alternatively, considering the other angles given, like ∠JLM = 25°, which is at L. If this relates to some triangle at J. 

Alternatively, since ∠KJN = 25°, and ∠KLJ = 18°, which is at L, maybe there's a relationship between these angles via some triangle. 

Let me try to consider triangle JKL. Even though it seemed contradictory before, perhaps there's a way. 

If ∠JKL = 18°, and ∠KJL = 18°, then it's isosceles with JK = JL. But we know from congruences that JK = KN. So, JL = JK = KN. 

If JL = JK, then JL = KN. 

But I don't know about JL's relation to other parts. 

Alternatively, if ∠KJL = 18°, and ∠KLJ = 18°, then it's isosceles with JK = JL. 

But this is speculative. 

Assuming that, then JL = JK. 

Also, from earlier, in triangle JKN, ∠KJN = 25°. 

If JL = JK, then JL = JK = KN. 

Now, considering point L on line JK, if JL = JK, then L is located such that JL = JK. If J is one endpoint, and K is another, then L would be a point such that JL = JK. For example, if J is at origin, K is at distance d, then L is at distance d from J, so L is at the same position as K, which is not possible. Or if L is on the extension of JK beyond J, then JL = JK would mean L is at distance JK from J, so KL = JL + JK = 2JK. 

But this is getting too vague. 

Given the time I've spent and the need to choose an answer, let me review the choices: 105, 106, 108, 111. 

From the earlier calculation in triangle JKN, ∠KJN = 25°, which might be part of ∠J. If there are other angles at J, say 81°, then total ∠J could be 25 + 81 = 106, which is choice B. 

Alternatively, if ∠J is composed of 25° and 81°, giving 106°, which is option B. 

Alternatively, other combinations. 

Given that, I'll go with B. 106°.
