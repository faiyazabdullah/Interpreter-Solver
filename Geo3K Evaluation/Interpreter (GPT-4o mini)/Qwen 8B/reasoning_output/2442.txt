MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, C, D, E, and several lines connecting them. The angles at point E are mentioned, each between two lines. All these angles are equal, and we need to find the measure x of each angle.

First, I'll parse the given predicates. There are four lines: AE, BE, CE, DE. That means all these points A, B, C, D are connected to point E. So E is like the common vertex where all these lines meet. Then there are four angles mentioned: Angle(A,E,C), Angle(C,E,B), Angle(B,E,D), and Angle(D,E,A). Each of these angles has measure x. 

So, visualizing this, point E is the center, and points A, B, C, D are around it, each connected by lines. The angles formed at E between consecutive points are all equal. Wait, but how are they arranged? Let me think. The first angle is between A-E-C, so A to E to C. Then C-E-B, so C to E to B. Then B-E-D, and finally D-E-A. So if you imagine standing at point E, looking towards A, then turning towards C, then towards B, then towards D, and back to A. This seems like a cyclic arrangement around point E.

Since all these angles at E are equal, each one is x degrees. But since they form a full circle around point E, the sum of all angles around a point should be 360 degrees. How many angles are there here? Let's count: Angle(AEC), Angle(CEB), Angle(BED), Angle(DEA). That's four angles. So adding them up gives 4x = 360 degrees. Therefore, x would be 360 divided by 4, which is 90 degrees. So x equals 90. 

Wait, but let me make sure there aren't overlapping angles or something. Because sometimes when you have intersecting lines, angles can overlap. However, in this case, each angle is between two adjacent lines. Since there are four lines emanating from E, they divide the plane into four angles. So yes, each angle is 360/4=90 degrees. So x is 90. Looking at the answer choices, option C is 90. So the answer should be C.

But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Are all those angles indeed adjacent? For example, Angle(AEC) and Angle(CEB) share the side EC. Similarly, the next angle is BED, which shares EB, and then DEA shares ED. So each subsequent angle is adjacent, forming a full circle. Hence, total angles sum to 360. Thus, each is 90. That makes sense. So the answer is C.
