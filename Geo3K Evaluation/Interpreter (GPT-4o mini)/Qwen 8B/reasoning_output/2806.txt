MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. So, we have a quadrilateral ABCD, and it's given as a parallelogram. Also, there are some angle measures mentioned. Let me start by recalling the properties of a parallelogram because that seems crucial here.

First, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. Also, opposite angles are equal, and consecutive angles are supplementary. That means if one angle is, say, x degrees, the opposite angle is also x, and the adjacent angles would add up to 180 degrees. Wait, but the problem mentions specific angles with measures involving x. Let me note down all the given information.

The predicates mention:
- MeasureOf(Angle(D, A, B)) = 3x
- MeasureOf(Angle(A, D, C)) = x
- RightAngle at Angle(B, A, D) and Angle(C, D, A). 

So, first, I need to visualize or sketch the parallelogram ABCD. In a standard labeling, the vertices are in order, so AB, BC, CD, DA are the sides. But since it's a parallelogram, AB is parallel to CD, and AD is parallel to BC. Also, opposite angles are equal.

Wait, the angles mentioned are Angle(D, A, B), which would be the angle at point A between points D and B. Similarly, Angle(A, D, C) is the angle at D between points A and C. Also, there are two right angles: Angle(B, A, D) and Angle(C, D, A). Wait, maybe I should clarify the notation for angles. The angle notation is typically written as Angle(X, Y, Z) which represents the angle at vertex Y between points X and Z. So, Angle(B, A, D) is the angle at A between BA and DA. Similarly, Angle(C, D, A) is the angle at D between DC and DA.

But since ABCD is a parallelogram, the angles at each vertex should follow certain rules. However, they also mention that these two angles are right angles. So, angle at A between BA and DA is a right angle, and angle at D between DC and DA is also a right angle. Wait, if both those angles are right angles, does that mean that the parallelogram has two right angles? But in a general parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, and consecutive angles are supplementary. If two of them are right angles, then all four angles would be right angles, making it a rectangle. Because if one angle is 90 degrees, then the opposite angle is also 90, and consecutive angles would be 90 as well. Therefore, the figure is a rectangle. But wait, rectangles are parallelograms with all angles right angles. However, the problem gives specific angle measures in terms of x, so perhaps there's more to it?

Wait, the given measure of Angle(D, A, B) is 3x. Wait, Angle(D, A, B) is the angle at A between D and B. Since in a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. But if angle at A is a right angle, then that would make the adjacent angle at B also a right angle. But according to the given, there's another right angle at D. Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting the angle notations.

Let me try to label the parallelogram properly. Let me consider points A, B, C, D arranged such that AB is parallel to CD and AD is parallel to BC. Now, the angles mentioned:

RightAngle(Angle(B, A, D)): This is the angle at A between BA and DA. So, angle BAD is a right angle. Similarly, RightAngle(Angle(C, D, A)): this is the angle at D between CD and DA. So, angle ADC is a right angle. Therefore, in the parallelogram, angles at A and D are right angles. Therefore, since in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So, angle at A is 90 degrees, then angle at B would be 180 - 90 = 90 degrees, same for angle at C. Thus, all angles are 90 degrees, making it a rectangle. But then why are the other angle measures given as 3x and x?

Wait, the problem says MeasureOf(Angle(D, A, B)) is 3x. But if angle BAD is a right angle, then that angle is 90 degrees. So 3x equals 90 degrees, implying x = 30 degrees. Then, MeasureOf(Angle(A, D, C)) is x, which would be 30 degrees. But angle ADC is supposed to be a right angle. Wait, there's a contradiction here. Because angle ADC is given as a right angle, but according to the measure, it's x. So this suggests that my initial assumption about the angle labels may be wrong.

Alternatively, maybe I misread the angle notations. Let me double-check. The angle Angle(A, D, C) is the angle at D between A and C. Wait, angle ADC is formed at point D between points A, D, C. So, angle ADC is indeed the angle at D. Which was stated as a right angle. But according to the MeasureOf(Angle(A, D, C)) is x. So that implies angle ADC is x degrees. But it's also given as a right angle. Hence, x must be 90 degrees. But earlier, Angle(D, A, B) is 3x. That would be angle at A between D and B, which is angle DAB. If angle DAB is 3x, and angle ADC is x, but angle ADC is a right angle, so x=90. Then angle DAB would be 3*90=270 degrees, which is impossible because angles in a quadrilateral can't exceed 180 degrees. Clearly, something is wrong here. So my interpretation of the angle notations must be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the angle notations are different. Maybe Angle(D, A, B) refers to the angle at point A between points D and B, which is angle DAB. And Angle(A, D, C) refers to the angle at D between A and C, which is angle ADC. So, if both of these angles are given as 3x and x respectively, but also given that they are right angles. So angle DAB is 3x, angle ADC is x, and both are right angles. Then, substituting, 3x = 90 degrees and x = 90 degrees. But that leads to inconsistency unless x is both 30 and 90. Contradiction again. So there's a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, maybe the angle notations are referring to different angles. Let me re-express all the given predicates carefully.

Given:

MeasureOf(Angle(D, A, B)) = 3x → This is angle at A between D and B, i.e., angle DAB = 3x.

MeasureOf(Angle(A, D, C)) = x → This is angle at D between A and C, i.e., angle ADC = x.

Also, RightAngle(Angle(B, A, D)) → This is angle at A between B and D, which is angle BAD, which is the same as angle DAB. So angle BAD is a right angle. Similarly, RightAngle(Angle(C, D, A)) → angle at D between C and A, which is angle CDA, same as angle ADC. So angle ADC is a right angle.

Therefore, angle DAB = 3x, angle ADC = x, and both are right angles. Therefore, 3x = 90°, and x = 90°. But that would imply x = 90°, leading to 3x = 270°, which is impossible. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. This suggests that my interpretation is wrong.

Alternative possibility: Perhaps the angle notations refer to different angles. For example, Angle(B, A, D) could be the angle at A between B and D, which is angle BAD. And Angle(C, D, A) is the angle at D between C and A, which is angle CDA. So, if both of these are right angles, then angles BAD and CDA are right angles. In a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So angle BAD + angle ADC = 180°. But if angle BAD is 90°, then angle ADC must be 90°, making all angles 90°, hence a rectangle. But according to the measures given, angle DAB is 3x and angle ADC is x. If both are 90°, then 3x = 90° → x = 30°, and x = 90°, which is impossible. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. So where is the error?

Wait, maybe the angle measures are not directly those angles. Let me think again. The problem states:

- MeasureOf(Angle(D, A, B)) 3x → So angle DAB is 3x.

- MeasureOf(Angle(A, D, C)) x → angle ADC is x.

Additionally, RightAngle(Angle(B, A, D)) → angle BAD is a right angle. So angle BAD = 90°, which is the same as angle DAB. Therefore, 3x = 90°, so x = 30°. Then, angle ADC is x = 30°, but angle ADC is given as a right angle. So that contradicts. Hence, there must be a misunderstanding in how the angles are labeled.

Wait, perhaps the angle measures are not for the interior angles of the parallelogram. Or maybe the angle notations are different. Let me check the notation again. The angle Angle(X, Y, Z) is the angle at Y between points X and Z. So for example, Angle(D, A, B) is the angle at A between points D and B, which is angle DAB. Similarly, Angle(A, D, C) is the angle at D between points A and C, which is angle ADC. So that part is correct.

But if angle BAD is a right angle, then angle DAB = 90°, so 3x = 90°, giving x = 30°. Then angle ADC is x = 30°, but the problem also states that angle ADC is a right angle. Therefore, 30° ≠ 90°, which is impossible. Hence, there must be a miscalculation or misinterpretation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not stating that both angles are right angles, but rather that certain angles are right angles. Let me check the original problem again:

"RightAngle(Angle(B, A, D))" and "RightAngle(Angle(C, D, A))". So angle at A between B and D (BAD) is a right angle, and angle at D between C and A (CDA) is a right angle. But in a parallelogram, angle BAD and angle ADC are consecutive angles. In a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So angle BAD + angle ADC = 180°. If both are right angles, then 90° + 90° = 180°, which works. So this would imply that the parallelogram is a rectangle. But according to the given measures, angle BAD is 3x and angle ADC is x. If both are right angles, then 3x = 90° and x = 90°, which is impossible unless x is both 30 and 90. This contradiction suggests that either the problem is inconsistent, or there's a misunderstanding in the angle notations.

Wait, perhaps the measure of angle ADC is not x, but something else. Let me recheck the given predicates:

MeasureOf(Angle(A, D, C)) x. So Angle(A, D, C) is the angle at D between A and C. That is angle ADC. So yes, angle ADC is x. But if angle ADC is a right angle, then x = 90°, and angle BAD is 3x = 270°, which is impossible. Hence, this suggests that my previous conclusion about the angle being at D is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the angle is not the internal angle but an external one? Or perhaps the angle is not the interior angle of the parallelogram.

Alternatively, maybe the parallelogram is not convex? But in standard definitions, parallelograms are considered convex.

Alternatively, perhaps the given angles are not the interior angles. Let me think differently. Suppose that the angle measures given are not the internal angles but some other angles within the figure. For example, maybe the angle DAB is split into parts, and the given measures are for some sub-angles.

Wait, but the problem says "MeasureOf(Angle(D, A, B)) 3x", which would be the entire angle at A. Unless there are other lines creating sub-angles. But the problem doesn't mention any diagonals or other lines. Given that it's a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, but without knowing that, we can't assume anything about diagonals.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a non-standard notation for angles. For instance, maybe Angle(D, A, B) refers to the angle at A formed by extending some lines? But without more info, it's hard to tell.

Another thought: Maybe the parallelogram is actually a rhombus or something else, but the given conditions still don't resolve the contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the angle measures given are not for the interior angles but for some other angles. For example, if there's a diagonal involved. Let me consider drawing diagonal AC. In a parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other, but they also create triangles. If we draw diagonal AC, then triangle ABD and triangle CBD. But I don't see how that connects to the given angle measures.

Alternatively, maybe the angles given are not the internal angles but angles formed by some intersection. But the problem statement doesn't mention any intersections other than the vertices.

This seems like a dead end. Let me think again. Perhaps there's an error in assuming that angle ADC is a right angle. Let me verify the given RightAngle(Angle(C, D, A)). This is the angle at D between C and A, which is angle ADC. So that's definitely the internal angle at D. So if angle ADC is a right angle, and angle BAD is a right angle, then the parallelogram is a rectangle, but the given measures conflict.

Wait, unless the angle measures given are not for the internal angles. For example, maybe the MeasureOf(Angle(D, A, B)) refers to an external angle. But in standard terminology, the measure of an angle at a vertex is the internal angle unless specified otherwise.

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves a three-dimensional figure, but that's unlikely given the context.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't saying that both angles are right angles, but that certain angles are right angles. Let me re-read the problem statement:

"RightAngle(Angle(B, A, D))" and "RightAngle(Angle(C, D, A))". These are two separate right angles. So angle at A between B and D is a right angle, and angle at D between C and A is a right angle. So angle BAD and angle ADC are both right angles. As before, which would force the parallelogram to be a rectangle, but the given measures for these angles are 3x and x, leading to a contradiction unless x is both 30 and 90.

Wait, unless there's a miscalculation here. Let me write equations:

From the RightAngle(Angle(B, A, D)), angle BAD = 90°. But angle BAD is also given as 3x. So 3x = 90° ⇒ x = 30°.

Then, MeasureOf(Angle(A, D, C)) = x ⇒ angle ADC = x = 30°. But angle ADC is also given as a right angle (from RightAngle(Angle(C, D, A))). So angle ADC = 90°, which would mean x = 90°, conflicting with x = 30°. Hence, contradiction.

This suggests that there's an error in the problem setup or my interpretation. However, since the problem is presented as solvable, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the angle notations.

Let me try a different approach. Let's suppose that the angle at A (BAD) is 3x, and the angle at D (ADC) is x. Also, both are right angles. Wait, but if angle BAD is 3x and angle ADC is x, and they are right angles, then 3x = 90° and x = 90°, which is impossible. So this can't be. Hence, perhaps the right angles are not for those angles but for others.

Wait, maybe the right angles are for other angles. For example, maybe Angle(B, A, D) is not angle BAD but another angle. Let me re-examine the notation. Angle(B, A, D) is the angle at A between points B and D. So that is angle BAD. Same as before.

Similarly, Angle(C, D, A) is the angle at D between points C and A, which is angle CDA. So that's angle ADC. So both are right angles. Hence, the problem is contradictory unless x is both 30 and 90, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be a different interpretation.

Wait, maybe the angle measures given are not for the angles of the parallelogram itself but for some other angles created by intersecting lines. For example, if there are diagonals, or if the parallelogram is divided in some way. But the problem doesn't mention any such lines. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle measures are for angles outside the parallelogram. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the angle measures are not in degrees but in radians? No, that's unlikely. The answer choices are numerical, likely in degrees.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the relationship between the angles in a parallelogram. Let me recall: In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, and consecutive angles are supplementary. So, if angle BAD is 3x, then its opposite angle, angle BCD, is also 3x. The consecutive angles, like angle ADC, would be supplementary to angle BAD. So angle ADC = 180° - 3x. But according to the given, angle ADC is x, so:

x = 180° - 3x  
=> 4x = 180°  
=> x = 45°  

Ah! Here's the key. Earlier, I incorrectly assumed that angle ADC is a right angle due to the RightAngle predicate, but perhaps that's not the case. Wait, the problem says RightAngle(Angle(C, D, A)), which is angle ADC. So angle ADC is a right angle, meaning x = 90°, but according to the equation above, x = 45°. Contradiction again. So this suggests that the two conditions cannot hold simultaneously, unless there's a miscalculation.

Wait, let me re-express all equations properly. Let's denote:

In parallelogram ABCD:

- Angles at A and C are equal (opposite angles).
- Angles at B and D are equal (opposite angles).
- Consecutive angles are supplementary.

Now, given:

1. MeasureOf(Angle(D, A, B)) = 3x → This is angle BAD = 3x.
2. MeasureOf(Angle(A, D, C)) = x → This is angle ADC = x.
3. RightAngle(Angle(B, A, D)) → angle BAD is a right angle, so 3x = 90° ⇒ x = 30°.
4. RightAngle(Angle(C, D, A)) → angle ADC is a right angle, so x = 90°.

But x cannot be both 30° and 90°. This contradiction indicates an error in assumptions. However, since the problem is given, there must be a resolution. Let me reconsider the relationship between the angles.

Perhaps the RightAngle(Angle(C, D, A)) is not angle ADC but another angle. Let me recheck: Angle(C, D, A) is the angle at D between C and A, which is angle ADC. Yes. So that's the same as before.

Wait, maybe the problem is not a parallelogram but a different quadrilateral? But the predicate says Parallelogram(A, B, C, D). So it is a parallelogram.

Wait, perhaps the given RightAngles are not for the internal angles but for other angles. For example, if there is a diagonal, creating right angles. Let me try that.

Suppose in parallelogram ABCD, diagonal AC is drawn. Then, the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. But if there's a right angle at A between BA and DA, which is already an internal angle. Alternatively, maybe the diagonals form right angles with the sides? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the RightAngle predicates refer to other angles. For example, if there's a perpendicularity between sides. But in a parallelogram, adjacent sides are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a rectangle.

Wait, but if angle BAD is a right angle, then the sides AB and AD are perpendicular, making it a rectangle. But then angle ADC would also be a right angle. Hence, all angles are right angles, making it a rectangle. But then, according to the given measures, angle BAD is 3x and angle ADC is x. If both are 90°, then 3x = 90° ⇒ x = 30°, and x = 90°, which is impossible. Hence, this suggests that the problem is flawed, or there's a different interpretation.

Wait, perhaps the angle measures are not for the internal angles but for some other angles formed by the diagonals. For example, if diagonal BD is drawn, forming triangles, and the given angles are angles within those triangles. Let me explore this possibility.

Assume diagonal BD is drawn in parallelogram ABCD. Then, in triangle ABD, we have angle at A (BAD) which is given as 3x, and if there's a right angle at A, then triangle ABD is a right triangle with right angle at A. But if angle BAD is 3x and it's a right angle, then 3x = 90° ⇒ x = 30°. Then, angle ADC is x = 30°, but angle ADC is also supposed to be a right angle. So again, contradiction.

Alternatively, maybe the right angles are not at the vertices but elsewhere. For example, if the diagonals intersect at right angles. But that's not indicated in the problem.

At this point, I'm stuck with the contradiction. Perhaps there's a typo in the problem, or I'm missing something. Let me try to proceed with the equations despite the contradiction.

From earlier, using the parallelogram properties:

Since angle BAD = 3x, and angle ADC = x, and in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary:

3x + x = 180°  
⇒ 4x = 180°  
⇒ x = 45°

So x = 45°. Then, angle BAD = 3x = 135°, and angle ADC = x = 45°. But the problem states that angle ADC is a right angle (90°), which conflicts with x = 45°. Hence, this suggests that the given RightAngle(Angle(C, D, A)) is not valid under these conditions. But since the problem includes that predicate, we must reconcile it.

Wait, perhaps the RightAngle(Angle(C, D, A)) is not angle ADC but another angle. Let me recheck the notation: Angle(C, D, A) is the angle at D between C and A, which is angle ADC. So it's the same as before.

Unless the problem meant Angle(C, D, A) as the angle at C between D and A? No, the notation is Angle(X, Y, Z) is angle at Y between X and Z. So Angle(C, D, A) is at D.

Hmm. This is perplexing. Let me try to ignore the right angles for a moment and focus on the angle measures. If we use the parallelogram properties, we get x = 45°, and thus angle ADC = 45°, which contradicts the right angle condition. But if we take the right angle condition, we get x = 90°, leading to angle BAD = 270°, which is invalid. So, what's the solution here?

Maybe the problem assumes that even though ABCD is a parallelogram, it's not a rectangle, and the right angles are not for the internal angles but for other angles. For example, if the sides are perpendicular to each other in some way. Wait, but in a parallelogram, if one pair of adjacent angles are right angles, then all are right angles. So it must be a rectangle.

Alternatively, maybe the given right angles are not for the internal angles but for angles formed by the diagonals. For example, if the diagonals intersect at right angles. In that case, the parallelogram would be a rhombus with perpendicular diagonals, but that's a different property. However, the problem states that it's a parallelogram, not necessarily a rhombus.

Let me try this approach: Assume that the diagonals intersect at right angles. In a parallelogram, if diagonals are perpendicular, it's a rhombus. But this is not stated in the problem. However, the problem gives RightAngle(Angle(B, A, D)) and RightAngle(Angle(C, D, A)), which might relate to the diagonals.

Wait, if we consider diagonal AC, then in triangle ABD, if angle at A is a right angle, then BD would be the hypotenuse. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the given right angles are for angles formed by the sides and diagonals. For example, if side AD is perpendicular to diagonal BD, making angle BAD a right angle. But this requires more information.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, perhaps I should proceed with the equations from the parallelogram properties, ignoring the right angle condition temporarily, and see what happens.

Using the parallelogram properties, we found x = 45°, leading to angle BAD = 135°, angle ADC = 45°, and since consecutive angles are supplementary, this holds. Then, what about the right angles? If angle BAD is 135°, it's not a right angle, but the problem states it is. Hence, contradiction. But if we accept that there's an error in the problem, or that the right angles are for other angles, perhaps the intended answer is based on the parallelogram properties, disregarding the right angle condition, leading to x = 45°, and hence angle C is... Wait, what is the question asking?

The question asks for ∠C of quadrilateral ABCD. In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So angle C is equal to angle A. Angle A is 3x = 135°, so angle C is also 135°. Hence, the answer would be 135°, which is choice C.

But this ignores the right angle conditions. However, since the problem includes the right angle predicates, which lead to contradictions, perhaps the intended solution is to disregard them or interpret them differently. For example, maybe the right angles are for angles formed by diagonals, not the internal angles. If we proceed with the calculation from the parallelogram properties, ignoring the right angles, we get x = 45°, leading to ∠C = 135°, which matches choice C.

Given that the answer choices include 135° (choice C), and considering that the contradiction in the right angles might be a red herring or due to misinterpretation, I'll proceed with this solution.
