MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out the measure of arc YXZ. Wait, first I need to visualize this. Since there's no image provided, maybe the problem involves a circle with points Y, X, Z? Or perhaps it's part of a triangle?

Hmm, the question asks for the measure of arc YXZ. Arc measures are typically associated with circles, so probably there's a circle involved here. Let me think. In circle geometry, the measure of an arc depends on the central angle or the inscribed angle subtended by the arc. Also, if there's a point outside the circle, we might use the external angle formula.

Wait, but without specific information about the diagram, I need to make assumptions based on standard problems. Maybe there's a triangle XYZ with some arcs mentioned? Or perhaps points Y, X, Z lie on a circle, and we're looking at arc YXZ, which would be a major arc if it spans more than 180 degrees.

Let me consider common scenarios. For example, if there's a triangle inscribed in a circle, and we're talking about the arc opposite a certain angle. Alternatively, if there's a tangent or secant line involved. But since the answer choices are large numbers (like 145, 166, 194, 215), these could be measures of arcs, possibly major arcs.

Another thought: sometimes, the measure of an arc can be found using the formula involving the sum of other arcs or angles. For instance, in a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles sum to 180 degrees. But again, without knowing the specific setup, it's tricky.

Alternatively, maybe there's a central angle and an inscribed angle. If angle YXZ is an inscribed angle intercepting arc YZ, then the measure of the arc would be twice the angle. However, the arc in question here is YXZ, which suggests three points—so maybe it's the entire circumference minus another arc?

Wait, arc YXZ implies that the arc starts at Y, goes through X, then ends at Z. So that's a major arc if X is not on the minor arc YZ. The measure of a major arc is 360° minus the measure of the corresponding minor arc. 

But how do I find that measure? Suppose there's an inscribed angle or a central angle that relates to this arc. For example, if there's a triangle where one angle is formed by two chords intersecting at a point on the circle, then the angle would be half the difference of the intercepted arcs. 

Alternatively, if there's an external angle formed by two secants, tangents, or a secant and a tangent, the measure of the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. 

Since the answer options are all over 145, maybe it's a case where we have to calculate the difference between two arcs. For instance, if there's an angle formed outside the circle, its measure would be half the difference of the intercepted arcs. 

But without concrete information, I need to make educated guesses. Let me think of a typical problem structure. Suppose there's a circle with points Y, X, Z such that XY and XZ are secants forming an angle at X outside the circle. Then the measure of angle YXZ would be half the difference of the intercepted arcs. 

For example, if arc YZ is 100°, and arc YXZ is the rest of the circle, which would be 360° - 100° = 260°, but that seems too big. Wait, but angle YXZ would be (arc YZ - arc YXZ)/2? No, wait, the formula is that the measure of the angle formed by two secants is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. So if the vertex is outside the circle, the angle equals half the difference of the intercepted arcs. 

So if angle YXZ is formed by two secants going to points Y and Z, then angle YXZ = ½(arc YZ - arc YXZ). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because arc YXZ would be larger than arc YZ. Let me check again. Actually, the angle formed outside the circle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are the arc between the two points (YZ) and the arc that's opposite, which would be the arc that's not between them. Wait, no—if the vertex is outside, the angle is half the difference between the intercepted arcs. So if the two intercepted arcs are arc YZ and arc YXZ (the larger arc), then the angle would be ½(arc YXZ - arc YZ). 

Suppose angle YXZ is given, then we can set up an equation. But since the problem is asking for the measure of arc YXZ, maybe we need to work backwards. For example, if angle YXZ is known, then arc YXZ would be 2*angle + arc YZ. But without knowing angle YXZ or arc YZ, this is tricky.

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle inscribed in the circle. For example, if triangle XYZ is inscribed, then the measure of arc YZ would be twice the measure of angle X. But again, without specifics, this is hard.

Wait, considering the answer choices: they range from 145 to 215. These are all greater than 180°, which would suggest that the arc YXZ is a major arc. So, if the total circle is 360°, then the minor arc YZ would be 360° - 215° = 145°, which is one of the answer choices. But why would arc YXZ be 215°? That would mean that the minor arc YZ is 145°, making the major arc YXZ equal to 360° - 145° = 215°. But how does that relate to the problem?

Alternatively, if angle YXZ is an inscribed angle intercepting arc YZ, then the measure of angle YXZ would be half of arc YZ. But if arc YZ is 145°, then angle YXZ would be 72.5°, which isn't among the answer choices. So that may not fit.

Wait, maybe there's a different configuration. Suppose there's a tangent and a secant. For instance, if there's a tangent at point X and a secant passing through Y and Z, then the angle between the tangent and the secant is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. So angle would be ½(arc XZ - arc XY). But again, without specific info, it's challenging.

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves a cyclic quadrilateral. In a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles are supplementary. If angle YXZ is part of such a quadrilateral, but again, without more details...

Wait, perhaps the problem refers to an arc measure directly. If the arc YXZ is given as a major arc, and assuming that the rest of the circle is known. For example, if there's a triangle where two arcs are known, but again, missing data.

Given that the answer choices are high numbers, maybe the arc is 215°, which is close to 2π radians (which is 360°). But 215° is less than 360°, so it's still a major arc. 

Alternatively, if there's a central angle that's 145°, then the arc measure would be 145°, but that's one of the options. However, the question specifically mentions arc YXZ, which might imply a longer arc.

Wait, maybe the problem is about the reflex angle at point X, which would correspond to a major arc. For example, if angle YXZ is a reflex angle (greater than 180°), then the measure of the arc YXZ would be equal to that reflex angle. But again, without knowing the actual angle, this is speculative.

Alternatively, suppose that the arc YXZ is composed of other arcs. For instance, if there are two arcs adding up to the total. Without more information, this is guesswork.

But since the answer choices don't align with straightforward cases, maybe the intended answer is B. 166°, or another number. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, think of the supplement of an angle. For example, if there's an angle that's 194°, then the arc could be 194°, but again, not sure.

Wait, another approach: sometimes, in problems with intersecting chords, the measure of an angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. For example, if two chords intersect inside the circle, the angle is half the sum. But if the angle is outside, it's half the difference.

Assuming that angle YXZ is formed by two intersecting chords, then the measure of the angle would be half the sum of the intercepted arcs. But again, without knowing those arcs, it's unclear.

Alternatively, if there's a triangle with vertices on a circle, and the arc YXZ is the sum of two arcs. For example, if points Y, X, Z are on the circle, and arc YX is 100°, arc XZ is 150°, then arc YXZ would be 100+150=250°, which isn't one of the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, if there's an inscribed quadrilateral where one arc is known. For instance, if arc YZ is 145°, then the opposite arc would be 145°, but that doesn't fit.

This is quite challenging without the diagram. Given the answer choices and typical problems, the most plausible scenario might involve an external angle formed by two secants. Suppose angle YXZ is formed by two secants intersecting outside the circle, intercepting arcs YZ and YXZ. Then angle YXZ would be ½(arc YXZ - arc YZ). Let's say angle YXZ is given, and we need to find arc YXZ. But without knowing the angle or arc YZ, we can't compute it directly.

Wait, but perhaps there's an assumption that arc YZ is something. For example, if angle YXZ is 25°, then arc YXZ would be 2*(angle) + arc YZ. But again, without specific values, this is just guessing.

Alternatively, if arc YZ is 145°, then the major arc YXZ would be 360° - 145° = 215°, which is option D. But why would arc YZ be 145°? If angle at X is half of arc YZ, then angle would be 72.5°, which isn't in the options. 

Alternatively, if there's a triangle where angle at X is 145°, then the arc YZ would be 290°, making the major arc YXZ as... Wait, no. In a triangle inscribed in a circle, each angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So if angle at X is 145°, then arc YZ would be 290°, which is impossible because arcs can't exceed 360°. So that's invalid.

Alternatively, if angle YXZ is an external angle formed by a tangent and a secant, then the measure is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. For example, if the tangent at Y and secant XZ form an angle, then angle would be ½(arc YZ - arc YX). Again, without knowing those arcs, it's hard.

Maybe the answer is D. 215°, which is 360° - 145°, implying that arc YZ is 145°, and thus the major arc YXZ is 215°. This fits with answer D. So even though the reasoning is a bit indirect, this might be the intended solution. Therefore, the answer is D.
