MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about a quadrilateral WXYZ being a rectangle, and we need to find the measure of angle 3 given that angle 1 is 30 degrees. The answer choices are A to D. 

First, I should recall the properties of a rectangle. From what I remember, a rectangle is a type of parallelogram where all angles are right angles. That means each interior angle is 90 degrees. Also, opposite sides are equal and parallel, and the diagonals bisect each other and are equal in length. Wait, but the problem mentions some specific angles here. Let me check the given predicates again.

Looking at the predicates provided, there are several statements about angles being 90 degrees. For example, MeasureOf(Angle(W,Y,Z)) equals 90, same for Angle(X,Z,W), Angle(Y,W,X), and Angle(Z,X,Y). So those four angles are all right angles. That confirms that WXYZ is indeed a rectangle because all its angles are 90 degrees. But how does that relate to angles 1 and 3?

Wait, the problem refers to angle 1 and angle 3. But the original question didn't specify which angles these are. Hmm, maybe the diagram labels angles 1 and 3 in a particular way? Since the user mentioned "angle 3" and "m∠1 = 30", perhaps there's an implied labeling of angles in the figure. However, since I don't have the actual diagram, I need to infer based on standard conventions.

In many problems, especially with rectangles, angles could refer to angles formed by intersecting diagonals. The diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other but aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, but in this case, the diagonals are mentioned as Line(W,Z) and Line(X,Y), which intersect at point A. So the diagonals cross at point A. In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other, so they split each other into two equal parts. 

So, if we consider the intersection point A, the diagonals divide each other into segments. Now, when two diagonals intersect, they form vertical angles. Let me think: if angle 1 is one of those angles formed at the intersection, then angle 3 would be another angle. But without knowing which specific angles are labeled 1 and 3, this is tricky. However, since angle 1 is given as 30 degrees, which is not 90, that suggests that angle 1 isn't one of the original angles of the rectangle. Instead, it's likely referring to an angle formed by the intersection of the diagonals.

Wait, in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other, but they aren't perpendicular unless the rectangle is a square. Therefore, the angles formed at the intersection of the diagonals would depend on the rectangle's side lengths. For example, if the rectangle is a square, the diagonals would be perpendicular, forming 90-degree angles. But in a general rectangle, the angles formed by the diagonals would be acute and obtuse. 

Let me try to visualize this. Suppose we have rectangle WXYZ with diagonals WZ and XY intersecting at point A. The diagonals split each other into two equal parts. So WA = AZ andXA=AY. The angles at point A would be vertical angles. If angle 1 is one of these angles, say ∠WAX, then angle 3 might be another angle formed by the intersection. Wait, but how are angles labeled here? Typically, in such cases, adjacent angles around the intersection point are supplementary. So if angle 1 is 30 degrees, then the adjacent angle would be 180 - 30 = 150 degrees. However, the problem asks for angle 3. Maybe there's a pattern in the labeling of angles. 

Alternatively, perhaps angle 1 and angle 3 refer to angles in the triangles formed by the diagonals. For instance, the diagonal divides the rectangle into two congruent triangles. Each triangle has angles that sum up to 180 degrees. Let me think. Suppose angle 1 is part of triangle WXY. Wait, no—the diagonals split the rectangle into four triangles. For example, the intersection of diagonals creates four triangles: WAX, XAZ, ZAY, and YAW. Each of these triangles would have angles that add up to 180 degrees. 

But if angle 1 is in one of these triangles, like ∠WAX, then angle 3 might be another angle in the same triangle or in another triangle. Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is an angle formed by the diagonal and a side. Wait, but the problem states m∠1 = 30°, which is different from the 90° angles of the rectangle. This implies that angle 1 is not one of the original rectangle's internal angles. 

Another possibility is that angle 1 is an angle formed by extending sides or considering external angles. However, without more details, I need to make assumptions based on common problem structures. 

Let me consider that the diagonals intersect at point A, creating vertical angles. If angle 1 is one of these angles, say ∠WAX, then its vertical angle would be ∠ZAY. Then, the adjacent angles would be ∠XAZ and ∠WAY. These adjacent angles are supplementary. So if ∠WAX is 30°, then ∠XAZ would be 180° - 30° = 150°. But the problem says to find angle 3. Assuming that angle 3 is another angle formed at the intersection, perhaps the vertical angle to angle 1? Or maybe angle 3 refers to one of the angles in the triangle created by the diagonal. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 and angle 3 are corresponding angles in the triangles formed by the diagonals. Let me try to use coordinates to model this. Let's assign coordinates to points W, X, Y, Z. Let’s assume W is at (0,0), X at (a,0), Y at (a,b), and Z at (0,b), making WXYZ a rectangle. Then the diagonals are WZ from (0,0) to (0,b) and XY from (a,0) to (a,b)? Wait, no—wait, the diagonals of a rectangle connect opposite vertices. So the diagonals would be W to Y and X to Z. Wait, the given predicates mention Diagonal(W,Z) and Diagonal(X,Y). Wait, that seems incorrect. Because in a rectangle, the diagonals are connecting opposite corners. So if the rectangle is WXYZ, then the diagonals should be WY and XZ. But according to the given predicates, Diagonal(W,Z) and Diagonal(X,Y). Wait, that would mean that the diagonals are WZ and XY. But in a rectangle, the diagonals are supposed to connect opposite vertices. So if W is connected to Z, and X is connected to Y, then that would imply that the rectangle is arranged such that W and Z are opposite, and X and Y are opposite. Which would mean that the rectangle is W-X-Y-Z-W. Wait, but that would require that the order of the letters is such that consecutive points are adjacent. So if W is connected to X, X to Y, Y to Z, Z to W. Then the diagonals would be WY and XZ. So if the diagonals are WZ and XY, that would mean that the rectangle is actually a square? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe the labeling of the rectangle is different. Perhaps the rectangle is labeled in a non-standard way. 

This confusion arises because the problem states Rectangle(W,X,Z,Y). So the rectangle is named with vertices W, X, Z, Y. So the order is W connected to X, X to Z, Z to Y, Y to W. Wait, but that would make the shape not a rectangle unless certain conditions are met. Wait, in a rectangle, consecutive vertices must be connected by sides. So the order matters. If it's W-X-Z-Y-W, then the sides are WX, XZ, ZY, YW. But for this to be a rectangle, all angles must be 90 degrees. So the sides WX and XZ would need to be perpendicular, and so on. 

Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is W-X-Y-Z-W, but the given predicate lists the rectangle as W,X,Z,Y. So the vertices are W, X, Z, Y. So the connections are W to X, X to Z, Z to Y, Y to W. For this to be a rectangle, the sides WX and XZ must be perpendicular, XZ and ZY must be perpendicular, etc. 

But regardless of the labeling, the diagonals of a rectangle are the lines connecting opposite vertices. So in this case, if the rectangle is W, X, Z, Y, then the diagonals would be W to Z and X to Y. Wait, yes! Because W and Z are opposite vertices, and X and Y are opposite vertices. So the diagonals are WZ and XY. Thus, the given predicates correctly state Diagonal(W,Z) and Diagonal(X,Y). 

Now, these diagonals intersect at point A. So the diagonals WZ and XY intersect at A. In a rectangle, diagonals are equal and bisect each other. So the point A is the midpoint of both diagonals. 

Now, the angles formed at the intersection point A. When two diagonals intersect, they form vertical angles. The key thing is that in a rectangle, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. So the angles formed at the intersection are not necessarily 90 degrees. 

Given that, suppose angle 1 is one of the angles formed at A. For example, if angle 1 is ∠WAX, then angle 3 could be another angle. But how do we determine which angle is which? 

Assuming that angle 1 is one of the angles formed by the intersection of the diagonals, and angle 3 is another angle in the same configuration. Since the diagonals bisect each other, the triangles formed are congruent. For example, triangle WAX and triangle ZAY are congruent. 

Let me consider the properties of the diagonals. In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal in length, so WA = AZ and XA = AY. The diagonals divide each other into two equal parts. Now, the triangles formed by the diagonals, such as triangle WAX, have sides WA, AX, and WX. 

Since the diagonals are not perpendicular, the angles at point A are not right angles. Let's denote angle 1 as ∠WAX. Given that m∠1 = 30°, we need to find angle 3. 

Assuming angle 3 is another angle formed at the intersection point, perhaps the vertical angle to angle 1, which would also be 30°, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe angle 3 refers to an angle in one of the triangles. For example, if angle 1 is ∠WAX = 30°, then in triangle WAX, the other angles can be found. 

In triangle WAX, the sum of angles is 180°. We know ∠WAX = 30°, and the other two angles are ∠AWX and ∠AXW. But wait, ∠AWX is part of the original rectangle. Since WX is a side of the rectangle, which is horizontal (assuming standard orientation), and the diagonal WZ is slanting. 

Wait, but without loss of generality, let's assign coordinates. Let me place point W at (0,0). Since it's a rectangle, let me define coordinates such that W(0,0), X(a,0), Y(a,b), Z(0,b). Wait, but according to the rectangle's vertex order W,X,Z,Y. So if W is (0,0), then moving to X(a,0), then to Z(a,b)? Wait, no. Wait, if the rectangle is W, X, Z, Y, then after X comes Z. So from X(a,0), moving to Z. To maintain the rectangle structure, the next point Z should be such that XZ is perpendicular to WX. Since WX is horizontal from (0,0) to (a,0), then XZ should be vertical upwards. So point Z would be (a, c) for some c. Then from Z(a,c), moving to Y, which should be connected back to W(0,0). So Y would be (0,c). Wait, but then Y would be (0,c), and Z is (a,c). So the rectangle would have vertices W(0,0), X(a,0), Z(a,c), Y(0,c). Connecting them in order: W to X to Z to Y to W. 

Then the diagonals are WZ and XY. Diagonal WZ connects (0,0) to (a,c), and diagonal XY connects (a,0) to (0,c). These diagonals intersect at point A. 

To find the coordinates of A, since diagonals bisect each other, the midpoint of WZ is ((0+a)/2, (0 + c)/2) = (a/2, c/2). Similarly, the midpoint of XY is ((a+0)/2, (0 + c)/2) = (a/2, c/2). So point A is at (a/2, c/2). 

Now, let's compute the slopes of the diagonals. Diagonal WZ goes from (0,0) to (a,c), so slope is (c - 0)/(a - 0) = c/a. Diagonal XY goes from (a,0) to (0,c), so slope is (c - 0)/(0 - a) = -c/a. 

Therefore, the two diagonals have slopes c/a and -c/a. The angle between two lines with slopes m1 and m2 is given by tan(theta) = |(m2 - m1)/(1 + m1*m2)|. Plugging in m1 = c/a and m2 = -c/a:

tan(theta) = |(-c/a - c/a)/(1 + (c/a)(-c/a))| = |(-2c/a)/(1 - c²/a²)| = | (-2c/a ) / ( (a² - c²)/a² ) | = | (-2c/a * a²/(a² - c²) ) | = | -2ac/(a² - c²) | = 2ac / |a² - c²|.

This gives us the tangent of the angle between the diagonals. However, we are told that one of the angles formed at the intersection is 30 degrees. Let's assume that angle 1 is the angle between the diagonals. So theta = 30°, so tan(theta) = tan(30°) = 1/√3 ≈ 0.577. 

Setting this equal to our expression:

2ac / |a² - c²| = 1/√3.

But without knowing the ratio of a to c, we can’t directly calculate the angle. However, maybe there's another relationship. Wait, but the problem states that m∠1 = 30°, and asks for m∠3. Assuming angle 1 is the angle between the diagonals, and angle 3 is another angle related to this. But how?

Alternatively, angle 1 could be one of the angles in triangle WAX. For example, in triangle WAX, angle at A (∠WAX) is 30°, and we need to find another angle. 

Let me analyze triangle WAX. Points W(0,0), A(a/2, c/2), X(a,0). So vector AW is from A to W: (-a/2, -c/2). Vector AX is from A to X: (a/2, -c/2). The angle at A between vectors AW and AX is angle WAX. 

Using the dot product formula, cos(theta) = (AW · AX) / (|AW| |AX|).

Compute the dot product:

AW · AX = (-a/2)(a/2) + (-c/2)(-c/2) = -a²/4 + c²/4 = (c² - a²)/4.

The magnitude of AW is sqrt( (a/2)^2 + (c/2)^2 ) = (sqrt(a² + c²))/2. Similarly for AX.

Thus, cos(theta) = [(c² - a²)/4] / [ (sqrt(a² + c²)/2)^2 ] = [(c² - a²)/4] / [ (a² + c²)/4 ] = (c² - a²)/(a² + c²).

So cos(theta) = (c² - a²)/(a² + c²). And theta is angle WAX, which is given as 30 degrees. Therefore:

cos(30°) = (c² - a²)/(a² + c²).

We know cos(30°) = √3/2 ≈ 0.866. So:

(c² - a²)/(a² + c²) = √3/2.

Cross-multiplying:

2(c² - a²) = √3(a² + c²)

Expand:

2c² - 2a² = √3 a² + √3 c²

Bring all terms to left-hand side:

2c² - 2a² - √3 a² - √3 c² = 0

Group like terms:

(2 - √3)c² - (2 + √3)a² = 0

Divide both sides by a²:

(2 - √3)(c/a)² - (2 + √3) = 0

Let k = c/a, so:

(2 - √3)k² = 2 + √3

Solve for k²:

k² = (2 + √3)/(2 - √3)

Rationalizing denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 + √3):

[(2 + √3)^2]/[ (2)^2 - (√3)^2 ] = [4 + 4√3 + 3]/[4 - 3] = (7 + 4√3)/1 = 7 + 4√3

So k² = 7 + 4√3 → k = sqrt(7 + 4√3). Let me compute sqrt(7 + 4√3). Not sure, but maybe simplify:

Note that 7 + 4√3 is approximately 7 + 6.928 = 13.928, sqrt of that is approx 3.73. But exact value may not matter.

However, the key point is that we can find the ratio of sides a and c. Now, returning to the problem, we need to find angle 3. What is angle 3? If angle 1 is ∠WAX = 30°, then what is angle 3? It depends on how the angles are labeled. 

In triangle WAX, the angles are ∠WAX = 30°, and the other two angles are at W and X. Let's call those angles α and β. Sum of angles is 180°, so:

30° + α + β = 180° → α + β = 150°. 

But without more info, how do we find angle 3? Unless angle 3 is one of these angles α or β. Alternatively, maybe angle 3 refers to an angle in another triangle. 

For example, if angle 3 is ∠AXY or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps angle 3 is the vertical angle to angle 1, which would also be 30°, but that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, since the diagonals intersect at A, and in a rectangle, the triangles formed are congruent. So triangle WAX is congruent to triangle ZAY, and triangle XAZ congruent to triangle YAW. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 3 refers to an angle in triangle XAZ. Let me consider that. 

But without knowing exactly which angle is referred to as angle 3, it's challenging. However, in many standardized problems, angles formed by the intersection of diagonals often come in pairs of supplementary angles. For example, if one angle is 30°, the adjacent angle is 180° - 30° = 150°, and the vertical angles are equal. 

But the answer choices are 30°, 45°, 60°, or 90°. If angle 1 is 30°, and assuming that angle 3 is the vertical angle to angle 1, then it would also be 30°, which is option A. But that seems too straightforward. Alternatively, if angle 3 is the adjacent angle, it would be 150°, which isn't among the options. Alternatively, maybe angle 3 refers to one of the base angles in the triangle. 

Let me go back to the earlier calculation where we had angle WAX = 30°, and tried to find the ratio of sides. From earlier, we had k² = 7 + 4√3, so k = sqrt(7 + 4√3). Let me compute sqrt(7 + 4√3). Let me see if this simplifies. Let me note that 7 + 4√3 can be expressed as (something squared). Suppose (a + b√3)^2 = a² + 2ab√3 + 3b². Setting this equal to 7 + 4√3:

a² + 3b² = 7  
2ab = 4 → ab = 2

Trying integer solutions: a=2, b=1: then a² + 3b² = 4 + 3 = 7. Yes! So sqrt(7 + 4√3) = 2 + √3. 

Therefore, k = 2 + √3. Hence, c/a = 2 + √3. So the ratio of the sides is c = a*(2 + √3). 

Now, with this ratio, we can compute the angles in triangle WAX. Earlier, we found that cos(theta) = (c² - a²)/(a² + c²). Let me verify with this ratio:

c = a*(2 + √3)

c² = a²*( (2 + √3)^2 ) = a²*(4 + 4√3 + 3) = a²*(7 + 4√3)

So (c² - a²) = a²(7 + 4√3 - 1) = a²(6 + 4√3)

And (a² + c²) = a²(1 + 7 + 4√3) = a²(8 + 4√3)

So cos(theta) = [a²(6 + 4√3)]/[a²(8 + 4√3)] = (6 + 4√3)/(8 + 4√3). Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 2*(3 + 2√3)

Denominator: 4*(2 + √3)

Simplify: [2*(3 + 2√3)] / [4*(2 + √3)] = [ (3 + 2√3) ] / [2*(2 + √3) ]

Let me rationalize or simplify further. Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 - √3):

Numerator becomes (3 + 2√3)(2 - √3) = 3*2 + 3*(-√3) + 2√3*2 - 2√3*√3  
= 6 - 3√3 + 4√3 - 2*3  
= 6 + √3 - 6  
= √3  

Denominator becomes 2*(2 + √3)(2 - √3) = 2*(4 - 3) = 2*1 = 2  

Thus, overall, cos(theta) = √3 / 2, which corresponds to theta = 30°, confirming our initial condition. 

Now, in triangle WAX, we have angle at A is 30°, and sides WA and AX. Let me find the other angles. Using the Law of Sines. In triangle WAX:

sin(angle at W)/AX = sin(angle at A)/WX

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, since we know the ratio of sides, we can find the angles. 

From earlier, in triangle WAX, we have:

WA = sqrt( (a/2)^2 + (c/2)^2 ) = (sqrt(a² + c²))/2

AX = same as WA, since diagonals bisect each other. Wait, no: AX is half the diagonal. Wait, the diagonal length is sqrt(a² + c²), so WA is half that, which is sqrt(a² + c²)/2. Same for AX. So triangle WAX has two sides equal (WA and AX), making it an isoceles triangle. Wait, but only if WA = AX. Are WA and AX equal?

Yes, because in a rectangle, diagonals are equal, so WA = AX. Wait, no: WA is half of diagonal WZ, and AX is half of diagonal XY. But since diagonals are equal, WA = AX. Therefore, triangle WAX is isoceles with WA = AX, and base WX. 

So in triangle WAX, sides WA = AX, so the base angles at W and X are equal. Let me denote those angles as α. Then:

α + α + 30° = 180° → 2α = 150° → α = 75°. 

So the base angles are 75° each. Therefore, angle at W (∠AWX) is 75°, and angle at X (∠AXW) is 75°. 

Now, if angle 3 refers to one of these angles, then it would be 75°, which is not among the answer choices. But the options are 30, 45, 60, 90. So this suggests that my assumption about angle 3 is incorrect. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 3 refers to an angle outside the triangle. For example, if angle 3 is the angle between side WX and diagonal WZ. Wait, but angle at W in the rectangle is 90°, and we've already considered the angles in triangle WAX. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 3 is the angle between the diagonal and the side. For example, in triangle WAX, angle at W is 75°, which is between side WX and diagonal WA. But this is still 75°, not matching the options. 

Hmm, this suggests that either my interpretation of angle 3 is wrong, or there's a different approach. Let me reconsider. 

Perhaps angle 1 and angle 3 are not within the same triangle. Let me think about the entire figure. At the intersection point A, there are four angles: two pairs of vertical angles. One pair is 30° and another pair is 150°, since they are supplementary. So if angle 1 is 30°, then the opposite angle is also 30°, and the adjacent angles are 150°. 

If angle 3 refers to one of these adjacent angles, then it would be 150°, which isn't listed. But none of the options are 150°. Alternatively, maybe angle 3 refers to an angle formed by the diagonal and a side, which we found earlier to be 75°, but again not in options. 

Wait, but maybe there's a misunderstanding in the labeling of angles. Perhaps angle 1 and angle 3 are not the ones I'm thinking. For instance, maybe angle 1 is one of the angles of the rectangle, but that conflicts with the given that they're 90°. 

Wait, the problem states that MeasureOf(Angle(W,Y,Z)) = 90°, which is one of the original rectangle's angles. So angle 1 cannot be that. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 refers to an angle formed by extending a side or something else. 

Wait, going back to the problem statement: the question says "Find the measure of ∠3 if m∠1 = 30." Without seeing the diagram, it's hard to tell exactly which angles are labeled 1 and 3. But in many standard problems involving rectangles and diagonals, the angles formed at the intersection are often the focus. 

An alternative approach: since the diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other and the angles formed are determined by the sides' ratio. Given that one of the angles at the intersection is 30°, which is acute, the other angle would be 150°, and since vertical angles are equal, the angles would alternate between 30° and 150°. 

If angle 3 is the vertical angle to angle 1, then it's also 30°, which is option A. But why would the problem give this information if it's redundant? Alternatively, if angle 3 is the supplement of angle 1, it would be 150°, but that's not an option. 

Wait, but looking at the answer choices, option C is 60°, which is a common angle in some configurations. Maybe there's a property I missed. 

Let me consider that in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other, but they're not perpendicular unless it's a square. The angle between the diagonals can be found using the sides' ratio. Earlier, we found that if one angle between diagonals is 30°, then the ratio of sides is c/a = 2 + √3. 

Now, if we consider the angles in the triangles formed by the diagonals. For example, in triangle WAX, which is isoceles with WA = AX, and angle at A is 30°, leading to base angles of 75°. But if angle 3 refers to one of those base angles, it's 75°, which isn't in the options. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 3 refers to an angle in another triangle. For instance, consider triangle XAY. Wait, but that's congruent to triangle WAX. 

Wait, maybe the problem involves more than just the diagonals. Let me recheck the given predicates. There are several angle measures specified as 90°, which confirm the rectangle's properties. But the question is about angle 3 given angle 1 is 30°, suggesting that angle 1 is not a corner angle of the rectangle. 

Another thought: perhaps angle 1 and angle 3 are angles in the triangles formed by the diagonals and the sides. For example, if angle 1 is the angle between the diagonal and a side, and angle 3 is another such angle. 

For instance, in triangle WAX, angle at W is between side WX and diagonal WA. As previously calculated, this angle was 75°, which is not in the options. But if there's another angle... 

Wait, in triangle WAX, we have angles 30°, 75°, 75°. If angle 1 is 30°, then maybe angle 3 is one of the 75° angles. But since 75° isn't an option, this suggests that my assumption about angle 3 is wrong. 

Alternatively, perhaps angle 3 is referring to an external angle or another configuration. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that angle 1 is ∠WAX. What if angle 1 is one of the angles formed by the intersection of the diagonals, like ∠WAX = 30°, and angle 3 is the angle between the diagonal and the side, which is 75°, but this is not an option. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 3 is the angle between the other diagonal and a side. For example, in triangle XAY, the angle at X between diagonal XY and side XY? Wait, not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves supplementary angles. For instance, if angle 1 is 30°, then the adjacent angle is 150°, and if angle 3 is the supplement of angle 1, it would be 150°, but again not an option. 

Wait, but maybe angle 3 is referring to an angle in a different triangle. For example, in triangle XAY, which is congruent to WAX. If angle 3 is the angle at Y, which would be the same as at W, which is 75°, still not matching. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 3 refers to an angle formed by the diagonals and the sides, but measured differently. 

I'm stuck. Let me think of another approach. Since the diagonals intersect at 30°, and the rectangle's properties, perhaps using trigonometry. 

Earlier, we found that the angle between the diagonals is 30°, and this relates to the ratio of the sides. Now, if we consider the diagonals dividing the rectangle into four triangles, and using the fact that the sum of angles around point A is 360°, with two angles of 30° and two of 150°. 

But if the question is asking for angle 3, and assuming that angle 3 is one of the larger angles (150°), but that's not an option. 

Wait, the answer choices are A. 30, B. 45, C. 60, D. 90. 

Maybe there's a misinterpretation. Perhaps the problem is not about the angle between the diagonals, but about another angle. 

Wait, the problem says "Quadrilateral W X Y Z is a rectangle. Find the measure of ∠3 if m∠1 = 30." 

Maybe the labeling of the angles is different. In some diagrams, angles are labeled sequentially. For example, in a rectangle, if you draw both diagonals, you might label the angles formed at the intersection as 1, 2, 3, 4. For instance, starting from one diagonal, the first angle is 1, then the next is 2, then 3, then 4. If angle 1 is 30°, then angle 3 would be its vertical angle, also 30°, making option A. But this assumes that angle 3 is vertical to angle 1, which would make it the same measure. 

Alternatively, if the angles are labeled in order around the intersection, like 1, 2, 3, 4 clockwise, then angle 1 and angle 3 would be opposite, hence equal. So if angle 1 is 30°, angle 3 would also be 30°, which is option A. 

But why would the problem provide all those angle measures as 90°? Because they are the original rectangle's angles. So perhaps the question is testing understanding that the diagonals create angles that are determined by the rectangle's properties, and if one angle is 30°, others are determined. 

However, in a rectangle, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. So if angle between diagonals is 30°, then the other angle is 150°, but if angle 1 is 30°, then angle 3 is the vertical angle, also 30°, which would be option A. 

But this feels like a trick question, where angle 3 is the same as angle 1. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to angles inside the rectangle, but not the ones formed by diagonals. 

Wait, but the given predicates include several 90° angles, which are the original rectangle's angles. So if angle 1 is one of those, but it's given as 30°, which contradicts. So angle 1 must be one of the angles formed by the diagonals. 

Thus, if angle 1 is 30°, and angle 3 is its vertical angle, then answer is A. 

But why would the problem provide all those 90° angles? Maybe to confirm it's a rectangle, and angle 1 is a new angle formed by diagonals. 

Thus, assuming that angle 3 is the vertical angle to angle 1, then the measure is 30°, option A. 

But earlier calculations suggested that angle between diagonals is 30°, and the other angles are 150°, but if angle 3 is one of those, it would be 150°, which is not an option. 

Wait, but if angle 1 is 30°, then the adjacent angle is 150°, and the vertical angle to angle 1 is 30°. So if angle 3 is the vertical angle, then it's 30°, making answer A. 

But this seems too straightforward, and the presence of the 90° angles in the predicates might be a red herring. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves more than just the diagonals. Maybe angle 3 is part of a triangle formed by sides and diagonals. 

But without seeing the diagram, it's challenging. Given the answer choices and the information, the most plausible conclusion is that angle 3 is the vertical angle to angle 1, so 30°, option A. 

But why would the problem include all those 90° angles? Maybe to ensure that it's a rectangle, allowing the diagonals to intersect at certain angles. 

Given the lack of clearer information, and the answer choices, I'll proceed with option A.
