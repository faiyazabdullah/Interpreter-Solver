====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we need to find the value of x based on the given angle measures and some points lying on certain lines. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

First, the angle measures:

1. Measure of Angle(F, B, D) equals x - 1.
2. Measure of Angle(D, B, E) is 79 degrees.
3. Measure of Angle(E, D, C) is x + 10 degrees.
4. Measure of Angle(I, B, G) is 2x degrees.

Then there are some point-line relationships:

- Point D lies on line BE.
- Point C lies on line DH.
- Point I lies on line BG.
- Point G lies on line I... Wait, that seems a bit confusing. If point G lies on line I, but I is a point? Maybe it's a typo or maybe it's a line named I? Hmm, perhaps the last one should be Point G lies on line BI or something else? Or maybe there's a misstatement here. Let me check again. Oh, the original says: "PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(I))". That would mean point G is on line I. But line I isn't defined yet. Wait, maybe there was a mistake in the input. Alternatively, maybe it's supposed to be another line. For example, if there's a line named BG, but I'm not sure. This part might need clarification. However, since I have to work with what's given, maybe these points and lines form a particular configuration.

But maybe focusing first on the angles. Since angles at different points involve points like B, D, E, C, I, G, etc. Let me try to visualize or sketch a rough diagram mentally.

Starting with the angles mentioned:

Angle at B: FBD has measure x - 1. Then angle at B, D, E is 79 degrees. Wait, angle D, B, E means vertex at B, with sides BD and BE. So angle at B between D and E is 79 degrees. Also, angle EDC is x + 10 degrees. That's angle at D between E and C. And angle IBG is 2x degrees, so vertex at B between I and G.

So maybe points F, B, D, E, C, I, G are arranged in some way. Let me think about how they connect.

Given that D lies on line BE. So points B, D, E are colinear, with D somewhere between B and E. So line BE passes through D. Therefore, angle at B involving D and E would be along that line.

Also, point C lies on line DH. So line DH connects points D and H, and C is somewhere on that line. Not sure where H is yet.

Point I lies on line BG. So line BG connects points B and G, and I is on that line. Also, point G lies on line I. Wait, that's confusing. If G is on line I, then line I must be a line that contains G. But line I isn't defined. Maybe it's a typo and meant to say line BG? Because earlier, I is on line BG. Wait, the original says: "PointLiesOnLine(I, Line(B, G))" — so point I is on line BG. Then "PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(I))" — so point G is on line I. But line I is just a line; maybe it's a line named I, which could be a line passing through points I and another point? Wait, but line I would require two points. Unless there's another point, but maybe it's referring to line IG? Or maybe it's a line that includes point I and G? Wait, but if point I is on line BG, and point G is on line I, then line I would have to pass through G and I. So line I is actually line GI. So point G is on line GI, which is the same as line IG. So that's redundant because if I is on line BG, and G is on line I (which is line IG), then line IG connects points I and G. So that's consistent.

So putting together, the lines involved are BE, DH, BG, and IG. Now, trying to see how these relate.

Let me focus on the angles first. We have angles at various points. Let's look at angles around point B. At point B, we have angle FBD = x - 1 and angle DBE = 79 degrees. Wait, angle DBE is 79 degrees. Since D is on BE, then BD is part of BE. So angle at B between D and E is 79 degrees. But if D is on BE, then BD is a segment of BE. So angle FBD would be adjacent to angle DBE?

Wait, if D is on BE, then the line BD is part of BE. So if there's a point F such that angle FBD is formed, then F must be a point not on line BE. So angle FBD is formed at point B, between points F and D, with BD being part of BE. So angle FBD plus angle DBE would make up angle FBE? Unless F is aligned in some way.

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle or other figure involving point F. But without more info, it's hard to tell. However, maybe we can use the fact that angles around a point sum to 180 degrees or 360 degrees depending on the situation.

But let's consider the angles given. We have angle at B: FBD = x -1, and angle at B: DBE = 79. Are these adjacent angles forming a larger angle? If yes, then x -1 + 79 would be part of a straight line or something else.

But if BD is part of BE, then angle DBE is 79 degrees, and angle FBD is x-1. Depending on where F is located relative to BE. Suppose F is on one side of BE, making angle FBD and angle DBE adjacent. So total angle at B between F and E would be (x-1) + 79. But unless there's more info, maybe we need to consider other parts.

Another angle given is angle EDC = x +10. That's at point D, between E and C. Since D is on BE, and C is on DH, so line DC goes from D to C, which is on DH. So angle at D between E and C would be angle EDC, which is x+10 degrees.

Also, angle at B: IBG = 2x degrees. So angle at B between I and G. Since I is on BG, then line BG is connected to point I. So angle IBG would be zero? Wait, no. If I is on line BG, then the angle at B between I and G would depend on the position of I. If I is between B and G, then angle IBG would be a straight line, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I is not between B and G. Wait, point I lies on line BG. So line BG extends infinitely in both directions. So if I is on line BG, then either between B and G, or beyond. But angle IBG is the angle at B between points I and G. If I is on line BG, then the angle between BI and BG would be zero if I is on BG. Wait, that can't be. There's confusion here. Wait, angle(IBG) is the angle at point B, with segments BI and BG. But if I is on line BG, then BI is part of BG. So the angle between BI and BG would be zero. Which suggests that maybe there's a misunderstanding in the setup. Perhaps the angle is at point B, between points I and G, but I is not on BG. Wait, but according to the given, point I lies on line BG. So that would imply that line BG contains point I, so BI is a segment of BG. Thus, angle IBG would be zero, which contradicts the given that it's 2x. Therefore, there must be an error in my interpretation.

Wait, maybe the angle is at point B, between I and G, but I is not on BG. Wait, but the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(I, Line(B, G)), meaning point I is on line BG. Therefore, the angle IBG is formed at point B, with sides BI and BG. But since I is on BG, BI is part of BG, making angle IBG zero. Which can't be. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Hence, perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the angle notation.

Wait, angle notation: Angle(IBG) means the angle at point B, between points I and G. So vertex at B, with segments BI and BG. But if I is on line BG, then BI is part of BG. Hence, the angle between BI and BG is zero. So this implies that either the problem has a typo, or there's a miscalculation here.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is not at B. Wait, angle notation: Angle(F,B,D) means the angle at point B between points F and D. Similarly, Angle(I,B,G) is the angle at point B between points I and G. So if I is on line BG, then BI is part of BG, so the angle between BI and BG is zero. Therefore, this suggests that there's an inconsistency unless 2x=0, which would mean x=0, but that's impossible given other angles. Hence, there must be a mistake in the problem statement or my understanding.

Wait, maybe the line is not BG but another line? Let me recheck the given predicates. 

Original: PointLiesOnLine(I, Line(B, G)). So I is on line BG. Then, Angle(I, B, G) is the angle at B between I and G. But if I is on line BG, then BI is a segment of BG. So the angle between BI and BG is zero. Hence, this seems contradictory. Therefore, perhaps there's a typo in the problem, and the intended angle is at point I instead of B? Or perhaps the angle is at point G?

Alternatively, maybe the line is not BG but another line. For example, maybe it's Line(B, I)? No, the predicate says Line(B, G). 

This seems like a critical issue. Without resolving this, we cannot proceed. Let me check again if I made a mistake in interpreting the angle notation. 

Angle(IBG) is the angle at point B, with segments BI and BG. So if I is on line BG, then BI is along BG, hence angle is zero. Therefore, the given measure 2x must be zero, implying x=0, which conflicts with other angles. Therefore, this suggests that perhaps the angle is not at B, but at point I? Or maybe there's a misprint in the angle notation. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is at point G? Like, Angle(I, G, B)? That would be angle at G between I and B. But the given is Angle(I, B, G), which is at B. 

Hmm. Given that this seems conflicting, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the positioning of the points. Maybe point I is not on line BG but on another line? Wait, the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(I, Line(B, G)), so I must lie on BG. Therefore, this seems to be a problem. 

Perhaps the problem involves a triangle where BG is extended beyond G to point I? Wait, but even then, if I is on BG extended, then BI would still be part of BG, leading to the same issue. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is not at B, but at point I? Wait, but the notation is Angle(I, B, G), which is angle at B. 

This seems like a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem, or maybe I need to reinterpret the angle. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is at point G? Let me think. If it were Angle(B, G, I), that would be angle at G. But the given is Angle(I, B, G), which is at B. 

Wait, maybe the problem uses a different convention for angle notation. In some contexts, Angle(X,Y,Z) is the angle at Y between X and Z. So, Angle(I,B,G) is angle at B between I and G. So if I is on BG, then this angle is zero. Hence, this is impossible. 

Therefore, perhaps there's a misprint, and the intended angle is at point I, i.e., Angle(B,I,G) or something else. Assuming that's the case, perhaps the angle is at point I, and the notation was mistyped. Alternatively, maybe the angle is at point G. 

Assuming that there's a typo, and the angle is at point G, then Angle(I, B, G) would be angle at G between I and B. Then, that angle could be non-zero. However, without knowing the exact configuration, it's difficult to proceed. 

Since this is a critical issue, perhaps I should assume that the angle at B between I and G is indeed non-zero, implying that point I is not on line BG. But the predicate says it is. Hence, this is a contradiction. 

Alternatively, maybe the line is not BG but BI? Let me check. The predicate says: PointLiesOnLine(I, Line(B, G)), so it's definitely line BG. 

This is perplexing. Since this seems like a dead end, perhaps I should set aside this angle for a moment and look at the other angles and see if there's another way. 

We have angles at B: angle FBD = x-1, angle DBE = 79 degrees. Since D is on BE, those angles might be adjacent. So, if we imagine line BE with point D between B and E, then angle FBD would be some angle at B, and angle DBE is 79 degrees. If F is positioned such that BF forms a separate line from BE, then angle FBD and angle DBE could add up to something. 

For instance, suppose F is above BE, creating triangle FBD. Then angle at B between F and D is x-1, and angle at B between D and E is 79 degrees. These two angles would be adjacent, forming a larger angle at B. However, unless there's a straight line or another constraint, we can't directly relate them. 

Additionally, angle EDC is x+10 degrees. Since D is on BE, and C is on DH, which connects to D and H. So, angle at D between E and C is x+10. That angle is part of triangle DEC or something similar. 

Now, considering that we might need to use the sum of angles in a triangle or supplementary angles. 

Let me attempt to write equations based on the angles. 

From the angles at point B: angle FBD = x-1 and angle DBE = 79. If these are adjacent, then the total angle at B between F and E would be (x-1) + 79. However, unless this total angle relates to another part of the diagram, we can't proceed. 

Looking at angle EDC = x+10. If we can find a relationship between this angle and others. 

Suppose we consider triangle EDC. But without knowing other angles or sides, it's hard to use. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a transversal or parallel lines creating corresponding angles. 

But without more information about the diagram, it's challenging. 

Let me try to focus on the angles that involve x. 

We have three angles involving x:

1. Angle FBD = x-1
2. Angle EDC = x+10
3. Angle IBG = 2x (but this seems problematic)

Assuming the angle at B between I and G is 2x, despite the previous confusion. Maybe the problem assumes that I is not on BG, but due to a typo, it's stated as being on BG. Let's tentatively proceed, assuming that the angle at B is 2x, and ignore the conflict for now. 

Now, if we consider that at point B, there are multiple angles. For example, angle FBD (x-1), angle DBE (79), and angle IBG (2x). If these angles are part of a straight line or around a point, their sum could be 180 degrees. 

But how do these angles relate? Let's think. 

If D is on BE, then BE is a straight line. So angle DBE is 79 degrees, which is a straight line. If there's another angle at B, like angle FBD, then it depends on where F is. If F is on one side of BE, then angle FBD and angle DBE could be adjacent, adding up to some value. 

Similarly, angle IBG is another angle at B. If I is on BG, then BI is part of BG, making angle IBG zero. But assuming it's 2x, we need to reconcile this. 

Maybe there's a triangle involving B, I, and G. If I is not on BG, but the predicate says it is. This is very confusing. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is at point I. If Angle(IBG) is at point I, then it would be angle between BI and GI. But the notation is Angle(I,B,G), which is angle at B. 

At this point, I'm stuck with the angle IBG. Since the rest of the problem may not rely on it, maybe I can proceed with the other angles and see if x can be found. 

So, let's look at angle EDC = x +10. If we can relate this to other angles. 

Since D is on BE, and C is on DH, then line DC connects D to C. So angle at D between E and C is x+10. If we consider triangle EDC, then the sum of its angles would be 180 degrees. But without knowing other angles in the triangle, it's hard to use. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a straight line involving D and C. 

But without more info, it's tricky. 

Let me try to consider possible scenarios where the angles at B add up. 

Assume that angles at point B are angle FBD (x-1), angle DBE (79), and angle IBG (2x). If these are adjacent and form a straight line, their sum would be 180. 

Wait, but angle DBE is already 79, which is along BE. If angle FBD and angle IBG are on the other side of BE, then their sum plus 79 would be 180. 

So, if angle FBD + angle IBG + angle DBE = 180, then:

(x-1) + 2x + 79 = 180  
=> 3x + 78 = 180  
=> 3x = 102  
=> x = 34  

But checking answer choices, none of them is 34. So this assumption might be wrong. 

Alternatively, maybe angle FBD and angle DBE are on the same side, adding up to something. 

If angle FBD and angle DBE are adjacent, forming a larger angle at B. Suppose that angle FBD + angle DBE = angle FBE. But without knowing what angle FBE is, we can't proceed. 

Alternatively, maybe angle FBD and angle DBE are vertical angles or something. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involving F, B, and D, and another triangle involving E, D, C. 

But without knowing more relations, it's hard to proceed. 

Let me think about the angles involving x. We have two expressions: x-1 and x+10. Perhaps these angles are supplementary or complementary. 

For example, if angle FBD and angle EDC are related somehow. Or maybe they're parts of a triangle. 

Alternatively, if there's a cyclic quadrilateral, but that requires knowing about opposite angles. 

Alternatively, maybe the sum of angles around point D. Since D is on BE and also on DH (since C is on DH), so angle EDC is at D. 

If we consider point D, it's on BE and DH. So lines BE and DH intersect at D. Hence, angle EDC is part of triangle HDC or something. 

But again, without knowing more angles at D, it's hard to relate. 

Wait, let's consider the angles at point D. Angle EDC is x+10. If we can find another angle at D, maybe from line DH and BE. 

Since D is on BE and DH, then lines BE and DH meet at D. So angle between BE and DH at D is angle EDB or something. But angle EDC is between ED and DC. 

If line DH continues past D to H, and point C is on DH, then DC is part of DH. So angle EDC is the angle between ED and DC, which is part of line DH. So, if we know angle EDC = x+10, and line DH continues, maybe there's a relation with other angles. 

But without more info, this is unclear. 

Back to the initial idea, if we assume that angles at point B sum to 180, even though there's a conflict with the angle IBG. Let's try that. 

Assume that angles at B: FBD (x-1), DBE (79), and IBG (2x) are all part of a straight line. So their sum is 180. 

Thus:

(x-1) + 79 + 2x = 180  
3x + 78 = 180  
3x = 102  
x = 34  

But this gives x=34, which isn't among the options. Hence, this assumption is likely incorrect. 

Alternative possibility: angle FBD and angle DBE are supplementary. 

So, (x-1) + 79 = 180 => x = 100. But again, not in options. 

Or, angle FBD and angle IBG are supplementary? 

(x-1) + 2x = 180 => 3x = 181 => x ≈ 60.33, not matching options. 

Alternatively, if angle DBE (79) and angle IBG (2x) are supplementary: 

79 + 2x = 180 => 2x = 101 => x = 50.5, not in options. 

Hmm. None of these seem to fit. 

Maybe the angles aren't on a straight line. Let's think differently. 

What if there's a triangle where x appears? For example, in triangle BDE, but we don't have enough info. 

Alternatively, consider triangle BDC or something. 

But without more information, it's difficult. 

Wait, looking back at the answer choices: A. 68, B. 78, C. 79, D. 136. 

Notice that 79 is one of the given angles (angle DBE is 79). If x=79, then angle FBD = 79-1=78, angle EDC = 79+10=89, angle IBG=2*79=158. Not sure if that helps. 

Alternatively, if x=78, then angle FBD=77, angle EDC=88, angle IBG=156. Still not seeing a pattern. 

Wait, maybe there's a triangle where the sum of angles is 180. For example, if angle EDC (x+10) is part of a triangle with other angles. 

But without knowing the other angles, it's hard. 

Wait, what if we consider that angle FBD + angle DBE + angle IBG = 180? As before, giving x=34. Not helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involving points F, B, D, E, etc. 

Alternatively, think about the sum of angles in a polygon. 

Alternatively, if there's a transversal creating alternate interior angles. 

But without knowing which lines are parallel, it's hard. 

Wait, another thought: since D is on BE, and C is on DH, maybe lines BE and DH are intersecting at D, forming vertical angles. If angle EDC is x+10, then maybe there's another angle at D that relates to it. 

For example, if lines BE and DH intersect at D, then angle EDC and angle BDA (if such an angle exists) might be vertical angles. But without knowing where A is, this is speculative. 

Alternatively, if there's a triangle involving D, E, C, and another point. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Let me revisit the angle IBG. If there's a mistake in the problem, perhaps it should be angle at G, and the measure is 2x. Let's try that. Assume angle at G is 2x. 

If angle at G is 2x, then perhaps it's part of a triangle with other angles. 

But without knowing the configuration, it's still unclear. 

Alternatively, if angle IBG is at point I, then it's angle at I between B and G. But again, without knowing the position of I, it's hard to proceed. 

Since this is taking too long and I need to make progress, let me try to assume that the angle at B between I and G is 2x, and that there's a typo in the predicate stating that I is on BG. Let's assume that I is not on BG, but on another line, and proceed. 

Assuming that, then at point B, we have two angles: angle FBD = x-1 and angle DBE = 79. These could be adjacent, forming a larger angle. Suppose that angle FBD + angle DBE = angle FBE. If this angle FBE is part of another triangle or line. 

Alternatively, if there's a triangle involving F, B, E, then angle at B is x-1 + 79. 

But without more info, it's hard. 

Alternatively, think about the angles around point D. Angle EDC = x+10. If we can relate this to other angles. 

If lines BE and DH intersect at D, then angle EDC is part of that intersection. If there's a line from D to C, and angle EDC is x+10, then maybe there's a triangle involving D, E, C. 

In triangle EDC, the sum of angles is 180. So, angle at D is x+10, angle at E and angle at C would be other values. But without knowing those, it's not helpful. 

Wait, but maybe there's a relationship between angle at D (x+10) and angle at B (79). For example, if lines BE and DC are parallel, then alternate interior angles would be equal. But this is pure speculation. 

Assume that BE is parallel to DC. Then, angle at D (x+10) would be equal to angle at B (79), because of alternate interior angles. 

So, x + 10 = 79 → x = 69. Close to option B (78) and A (68). But not exact. 

Alternatively, if BE is not parallel, but there's another relationship. 

Alternatively, if angle at D (x+10) and angle at B (79) are supplementary. 

x+10 + 79 = 180 → x = 91. Not in options. 

Alternatively, if angle at D (x+10) is part of a triangle with angle at B. 

But without more information, this is guesswork. 

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for another approach. 

Let me consider all the given equations:

1. Measure of Angle(F, B, D) = x - 1
2. Measure of Angle(D, B, E) = 79
3. Measure of Angle(E, D, C) = x + 10
4. Measure of Angle(I, B, G) = 2x

And the point relationships:

- D on BE
- C on DH
- I on BG
- G on I (line I?)

Assuming that the angle at B, IBG, is 2x, and ignoring the conflict for now, perhaps there's a way to relate angles at B and D. 

Let me try to write equations based on the angles. 

At point B, the angles around it could sum to 360 degrees if there are multiple rays. But if there are only two angles, like FBD and DBE, then their sum would depend on the configuration. 

If we assume that angle FBD and angle DBE are adjacent and form a straight line, then their sum is 180. So:

(x-1) + 79 = 180 → x = 100. Not in options. 

If they are part of a triangle, then... 

Alternatively, if there's another angle at B, like angle IBG (2x), then:

(x-1) + 79 + 2x = 180 → 3x + 78 = 180 → x = 34. Still not matching. 

But what if the angle at B is split into two parts: angle FBD (x-1) and angle DBE (79), and angle IBG (2x) is part of another triangle? 

Without knowing the exact configuration, it's impossible to say. 

Wait, let's try to consider that angle IBG (2x) is supplementary to angle DBE (79). So:

2x + 79 = 180 → 2x = 101 → x = 50.5. Not in options. 

Alternatively, angle FBD (x-1) + angle IBG (2x) = angle DBE (79):

x-1 + 2x = 79 → 3x = 80 → x = 80/3 ≈ 26.67. Not helpful. 

At this point, I'm really stuck. Maybe I should try plugging in the answer choices and see which one fits. 

Let's test each option:

Option A: x = 68

Then:

Angle FBD = 68 -1 = 67°

Angle DBE = 79°

Angle EDC = 68 +10 = 78°

Angle IBG = 2*68 = 136°

Now, if these angles are part of some relationships. Let's see:

If angle FBD (67) and angle DBE (79) are adjacent, their sum is 146. If there's another angle at B, like 136°, then total would be 146 + 136 = 282, which is over 360, so unlikely. 

Option B: x = 78

Angle FBD = 78 -1 = 77°

Angle DBE = 79°

Angle EDC = 78 +10 = 88°

Angle IBG = 2*78 = 156°

Sum of angles at B: 77 + 79 + 156 = 312°, which is possible if there are other angles. 

Option C: x = 79

Angle FBD = 79-1 = 78°

Angle DBE = 79°

Angle EDC = 79+10 = 89°

Angle IBG = 2*79 = 158°

Sum at B: 78 + 79 + 158 = 315°. Still possible.

Option D: x = 136

Angle FBD = 136-1 = 135°

Angle DBE = 79°

Angle EDC = 136+10 = 146°

Angle IBG = 2*136 = 272°. This seems too large, likely invalid. 

Now, looking for patterns. Notice that angle EDC is x+10. If x=78, then angle EDC = 88°. If this is part of a triangle with other angles, maybe. 

Alternatively, if angle EDC is supplementary to angle DBE: 88 + 79 = 167, not 180. 

If x=78, then angle FBD=77, angle DBE=79, angle IBG=156. If these are part of a triangle, but it's unclear. 

Alternatively, if angle IBG (2x) is supplementary to angle DBE (79): 2x + 79 = 180 → x=50.5. Not matching. 

Wait, but if x=78, then angle IBG is 156°, and angle DBE is 79°. 156 + 79 = 235, which is less than 360. 

Alternatively, if there's a triangle where angle EDC (x+10) and angle DBE (79) are part of it. 

For example, if angle EDC = x+10 and angle DBE = 79 are two angles in a triangle, then third angle would be 180 - (x+10) - 79 = 91 - x. 

But without knowing the third angle, this is not helpful. 

Alternatively, if x+10 + 79 = 180 → x = 91. Not in options. 

Wait, if x=78, then x+10 = 88, and 88 + 79 = 167. Not 180. 

Alternatively, if angle at D (x+10) and angle at B (79) are part of a triangle. 

But again, without knowing the third angle, it's not helpful. 

This is very frustrating. Perhaps I missed a key insight. 

Wait, going back to the original problem, the answer choices include 79, which is the measure of angle DBE. If x=79, then angle FBD = 78, angle EDC = 89, angle IBG = 158. 

Is there a scenario where these angles relate? For example, if angle FBD + angle EDC = angle IBG? 

78 + 89 = 167 ≠ 158. 

Or angle IBG = angle EDC + angle DBE: 158 vs 89+79=168. Close but not equal. 

Alternatively, angle IBG = angle FBD + angle DBE: 158 vs 78+79=157. Very close! 

That's almost matching. If x=79, then 2x = 158, and 78+79=157. Almost 158. Close enough? Maybe there's a rounding error or a typo. 

But why would angle IBG be approximately equal to the sum of angle FBD and angle DBE? It would make sense if there's a triangle or some geometric relationship where these angles are part of a larger structure. 

For example, if there's a triangle where angle IBG is the exterior angle, equal to the sum of the remote interior angles. 

If angle IBG (2x) is the exterior angle, then it should equal the sum of the two remote interior angles. If those are angle FBD and angle DBE, then:

2x = (x-1) + 79  
→ 2x = x + 78  
→ x = 78. 

Ah! This gives x=78, which is option B. 

Yes! This makes sense. 

So, if angle IBG is an exterior angle to a triangle where the two remote interior angles are angle FBD and angle DBE, then:

2x = (x-1) + 79  
2x = x + 78  
x = 78. 

This fits perfectly. 

But why would angle IBG be an exterior angle to a triangle with those two angles as remote interior angles? Let me visualize. 

Imagine a triangle where one side is extended, creating an exterior angle. If the two remote interior angles are angle FBD and angle DBE, then the exterior angle would be at point B, between F and G (assuming the extension is along BG). 

But this requires that the triangle has vertices at F, B, and E, with the extension of BE forming the exterior angle at B. However, this is speculative, but mathematically, the equation holds. 

Thus, solving 2x = (x-1) + 79 gives x=78, which is option B. 

This matches the calculation. Hence, the correct answer is B.
