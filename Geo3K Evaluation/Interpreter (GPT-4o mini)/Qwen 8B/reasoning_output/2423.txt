MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a triangle ABC, and it's given that AB is congruent to BC. Also, there are some length expressions involving x. Let me start by writing down what I know.

First, the triangle is isosceles with AB ≅ BC. That means two sides are equal. Wait, but in a triangle, if two sides are congruent, the base angles opposite those sides are also congruent. But here, since AB and BC are congruent, that would mean that angles at A and C are equal? Wait, no. Wait, AB is one side, BC is another. So vertices A, B, C. So AB is between points A and B, BC is between B and C. So AB and BC are two sides meeting at point B. Therefore, the triangle has two equal sides: AB and BC. So vertex B is the apex, and AC is the base. Therefore, the base angles would be at A and C. Wait, no. Wait, the base angles are the ones opposite the equal sides. Wait, if AB = BC, then the angles opposite them would be equal. The side AB is opposite angle C, and side BC is opposite angle A. Wait, let me recall: in triangle ABC, each side is opposite the corresponding angle. So side AB is opposite angle C, side BC is opposite angle A, and side AC is opposite angle B. So if AB equals BC, then angles opposite them, which are angle C and angle A respectively, should be equal. Therefore, angles at A and C are equal. So triangle ABC is isosceles with AB=BC, so angles at A and C are equal.

But maybe that's getting ahead of myself. Let me focus on the given equations. The lengths of AB, BC, and AC are given in terms of x. The problem says:

Length of AB is 2x -7,
Length of BC is 4x -21,
Length of AC is x -3.

Since AB ≅ BC, their lengths must be equal. So set 2x -7 equal to 4x -21. Solving that equation would give the value of x. Then once x is found, plug back into the expression for AB (or BC) to get the length AB. Wait, but the question asks for AB. So first, find x such that AB = BC. Let's do that.

So setting 2x -7 = 4x -21. Subtract 2x from both sides: -7 = 2x -21. Then add 21 to both sides: 14 = 2x. So x = 7. Then plugging back into AB's length: 2x -7 becomes 2*7 -7 = 14 -7 = 7. So AB would be 7. Then check if that works with other conditions?

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure that with x=7, the lengths are positive. Because lengths can't be negative. For example, AC's length is x-3. If x=7, then AC is 7-3=4, which is positive. BC is 4x-21, which with x=7 is 28-21=7. AB is 7. So all sides are positive. So that seems okay.

But hold on, is there another possibility? Since the triangle is isosceles with AB ≅ BC, but could there be another scenario where another pair of sides are equal? Like, perhaps AC equals AB or something else? Wait, but the problem states specifically that AB ≅ BC. So the given condition is that AB and BC are congruent. So that's fixed. So our initial approach is correct.

Therefore, solving 2x -7 = 4x -21 gives x=7, leading to AB = 7. So the answer should be 7, which is option C.

Wait, but let me check again. Let me verify all the steps. First, the problem says triangle ABC is isosceles with AB ≅ BC. So AB and BC are the two equal sides. Hence, their lengths must be equal. Therefore, equate their expressions. Solve for x. Then compute AB's length. All steps seem correct.

Alternatively, could there be a case where even though AB and BC are equal, another pair of sides might also be equal, making it equilateral? Let me see. If AB=BC=AC, then all sides equal. Let me check with x=7. AB=7, BC=7, AC=4. Not equal. So not equilateral. So it's just isosceles with AB=BC. So no conflict here.

Another thing to check: triangle inequality. For x=7, sides are AB=7, BC=7, AC=4. Check triangle inequalities: sum of any two sides greater than third. 7+7>4: yes. 7+4>7: 11>7, yes. 7+4>7 same. So valid triangle.

Hence, the answer is 7, which is option C. So the correct answer is C.
