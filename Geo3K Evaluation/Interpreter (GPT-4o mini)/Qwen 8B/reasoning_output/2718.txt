Okay, let's try to figure out the measure of angle 1 here. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and see how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

So, there are several angle predicates mentioned. Let me note them down:

- Angle(E,D,G): This means the angle at point D between points E and G.
- Angle(G,D,F): Angle at D between G and F.
- Angle(E,G,F): Angle at G between E and F.
- Angle(D,G,F): Angle at G between D and F.
- RightAngle(Angle(E,G,D)): So angle at G between E and D is a right angle (90 degrees).
- RightAngle(Angle(D,G,F)): Similarly, angle at G between D and F is also a right angle? Wait, wait. Wait, the notation for right angles might be different. Let me check again. The RightAngle(Angle(E,G,D)) would mean that the angle at G between E and D is a right angle. But the second one is RightAngle(Angle(D,G,F)), so that's the angle at G between D and F. Wait, but if both those angles are right angles, then maybe we have some perpendicular lines here?

Then, there are measures given:

- MeasureOf(Angle(E,D,G)) is 25 degrees. That's the angle at D between E and G.
- MeasureOf(Angle(D,G,F)) is 65 degrees. That's the angle at G between D and F.

Also, there are line predicates:

- Line(E,G), Line(G,F), Line(D,G), Line(D,F). So points E, G, F are connected in a way. Let me try to visualize this.

Let me sketch a rough diagram mentally. Points D, G, F are connected via lines DG and GF. Also, E is connected to G. And D is connected to F. So perhaps there's a triangle involved here?

Wait, since Line(D,G) and Line(D,F) are present, that suggests that D is connected to both G and F. Then, G is connected to E and F. So points E, G, F, D form some figure. Maybe a quadrilateral? Or two triangles sharing a common side?

But given the angles mentioned, maybe it's better to focus on triangles. For example, considering triangle DGF, since we have angles at G involving D and F. Also, angle at D between E and G being 25 degrees. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the right angles first. The RightAngle(Angle(E,G,D)) implies that angle at G between E and D is 90 degrees. So that would make triangle EGD a right triangle at G. Similarly, RightAngle(Angle(D,G,F)) says that angle at G between D and F is 90 degrees. Therefore, triangle DGF is also a right triangle at G.

So, points E, G, D form a right triangle with right angle at G. And points D, G, F form another right triangle with right angle at G. So, G is a common vertex where two right angles meet. Therefore, points E, G, D, F are arranged such that GD and GF are perpendicular to each other? Wait, because both angles at G are right angles. Wait, angle EGD is 90 degrees (from RightAngle(Angle(E,G,D))), and angle DGF is 90 degrees (from RightAngle(Angle(D,G,F))). So, that would imply that EG is perpendicular to GD, and GD is perpendicular to GF. Therefore, EG is parallel to GF? Because both are perpendicular to GD. Wait, no—if two lines are both perpendicular to the same line, they are parallel. So EG and GF are both perpendicular to GD, hence EG || GF? But that would mean that points E, G, F are colinear? Wait, no. Wait, EG and GF are two different lines. If EG is perpendicular to GD and GF is also perpendicular to GD, then EG and GF are both perpendicular to GD, so they are parallel to each other. But since both pass through G, they can't be parallel unless they are the same line. Wait, that seems contradictory. Unless EG and GF are the same line, but that's not possible because E and F are distinct points. So something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe my understanding of the angle notations is incorrect. Let me re-express the angles properly. The notation Angle(X,Y,Z) refers to the angle at Y between X and Z. So:

- Angle(E,D,G) is the angle at D between E and G. So, that would be ∠EDG.
- Angle(G,D,F) is the angle at D between G and F. So ∠GDF.
- Angle(E,G,F) is the angle at G between E and F. So ∠EGF.
- Angle(D,G,F) is the angle at G between D and F. So ∠DGF.

RightAngle(Angle(E,G,D)) translates to ∠EGD being a right angle. So that's the angle at G between E and D, i.e., ∠EGD = 90°. Similarly, RightAngle(Angle(D,G,F)) is ∠DGF being a right angle, so ∠DGF = 90°.

Therefore, at point G, there are two angles: ∠EGD and ∠DGF, both right angles. Which would imply that EG and GF are both perpendicular to GD. Hence, EG and GF are both perpendicular to GD, making them parallel to each other. However, since both EG and GF originate from G, they can't be parallel unless they are the same line. Therefore, this suggests that points E, G, and F are colinear? Wait, but that would make EF a straight line passing through G. But if EG and GF are parts of the same line, then ∠EGF would be a straight angle (180°), but that contradicts the presence of other angles. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the angles.

Alternatively, maybe the two right angles at G are adjacent, forming a straight line. Wait, if ∠EGD and ∠DGF are both right angles, then together they form a straight angle (since they share the side GD and GF). Wait, ∠EGD is between E, G, D; and ∠DGF is between D, G, F. So, these two angles are adjacent at G, forming the total angle around G. Since both are right angles, their sum would be 180°, which would make the total angle around G as 180°, implying that E, G, F are colinear? Wait, no. If you have two right angles at G, one between E-G-D and another between D-G-F, then the direction from G to E and from G to F would be opposite directions relative to GD. Wait, maybe GD is a vertical line, EG is horizontal left, and FG is horizontal right. Then, EG and FG are both horizontal lines, but in opposite directions. So, E and F are on opposite sides of G along the horizontal line. In that case, the line EF passes through G, making it a straight line. 

In this scenario, points E, G, F are colinear, with G between E and F. Then, the line EF is straight, and GD is perpendicular to EF. So, GD is like a vertical line intersecting the horizontal line EF at G. Now, looking at the other given angles:

MeasureOf(Angle(E,D,G)) is 25 degrees. That's ∠EDG, which is the angle at D between E and G. So, in this setup, D is connected to G and to F. Wait, but earlier we had Line(D,G) and Line(D,F). So, point D is connected to both G and F. So, D is somewhere off the line EF, connected to G and F. Let me try to imagine this. So, G is the intersection point of EF and GD. So, D is connected to G and to F. So, triangle DGF has a right angle at G (∠DGF=90°). Also, triangle EDG has a right angle at G (∠EGD=90°). So, D is connected to both G and F, and to E. 

Now, the measure of ∠EDG is 25 degrees. So, in triangle EDG, which is a right triangle at G, the angle at D (∠EDG) is 25°, so the remaining angle at E would be 90° - 25° = 65°. 

Similarly, in triangle DGF, which is a right triangle at G, the angle at D (∠GDF) is given as 65 degrees. Wait, no. Wait, the measure of ∠(D,G,F) is 65 degrees. That is, ∠DGF is 65°? Wait, no. Wait, ∠DGF is the angle at G between D and F. Wait, but earlier we said that ∠DGF is a right angle. Wait, hold on! There's a contradiction here. Because the RightAngle(Angle(D,G,F)) says that ∠DGF is a right angle (90°), but the MeasureOf(Angle(D,G,F)) is given as 65 degrees. Wait, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I misread the predicates.

Looking back: The predicates include RightAngle(Angle(E,G,D)) and RightAngle(Angle(D,G,F)). But then, later, the MeasureOf(Angle(D,G,F)) is given as 65 degrees. Wait, that would conflict with the RightAngle assertion. So, there must be a misunderstanding here. Let me double-check the original problem statement.

Original problem says:

- RightAngle(Angle(E,G,D)) → ∠EGD is a right angle.

- RightAngle(Angle(D,G,F)) → ∠DGF is a right angle.

But then, the MeasureOf(Angle(D,G,F)) is given as 65 degrees. Wait, this is impossible. How can ∠DGF be both a right angle and 65 degrees? That suggests that either there's a misinterpretation of the predicates, or perhaps a typo in the problem. Wait, perhaps the second RightAngle was meant to be something else? Or maybe I misread the angle notation.

Wait, let me recheck the original list:

The given predicates are:

- RightAngle(Angle(E,G,D))

- RightAngle(Angle(D,G,F))

But then:

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,G,F)), 65)

So, this would imply that ∠DGF is both a right angle (90°) and 65°, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the angle notations. Perhaps the RightAngle applies to a different angle than what's measured? Let me re-examine the angle notations.

The Angle(E,G,D) is the angle at G between E and D, i.e., ∠EGD. So, RightAngle(Angle(E,G,D)) → ∠EGD is 90°. 

The Angle(D,G,F) is the angle at G between D and F, i.e., ∠DGF. So, RightAngle(Angle(D,G,F)) → ∠DGF is 90°. But then the measure of ∠DGF is given as 65°, which contradicts the right angle. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my understanding. Perhaps the second RightAngle is referring to a different angle? Or maybe the Angle(D,G,F) is not ∠DGF but another angle?

Wait, the notation Angle(X,Y,Z) is the angle at Y between X and Z. So, Angle(D,G,F) is the angle at G between D and F, which is ∠DGF. So, the RightAngle(Angle(D,G,F)) would require that ∠DGF is 90°, conflicting with the MeasureOf(Angle(D,G,F)) being 65°. Therefore, this suggests that there's an error in the problem statement, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the angle notations.

Alternatively, perhaps the RightAngle is applied to a different angle. Wait, maybe the second RightAngle is actually referring to Angle(D,F,G)? No, that would still be the same as ∠DGF. Alternatively, could there be a typo, and the RightAngle should be for Angle(D,E,G)? Let me check the problem again.

Original problem's given predicates:

- RightAngle(Angle(E,G,D)) → ∠EGD is right.

- RightAngle(Angle(D,G,F)) → ∠DGF is right.

But then, MeasureOf(Angle(D,G,F)) is 65°, which conflicts. So, this inconsistency suggests that there's a misunderstanding. Wait, maybe the second RightAngle is not referring to the angle itself, but to a different part? Or maybe the problem has a typo. Assuming that the problem is correctly stated, perhaps I need to reinterpret the angle notations differently. 

Alternatively, perhaps the RightAngle(Angle(D,G,F)) refers to a different angle. Wait, perhaps the angle is at F instead of G? But the notation is Angle(D,G,F), which is angle at G. So, this seems consistent. 

Hmm. This is confusing. Given that the problem includes both a right angle and a non-right angle measure for the same angle, which is impossible, there must be an error. However, assuming that the problem is correct, maybe I've misread the angle names. Let me go back to the problem statement carefully.

Problem states:

- RightAngle(Angle(E,G,D)) → ∠EGD is right.

- RightAngle(Angle(D,G,F)) → ∠DGF is right.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,G,F)), 65) → So, ∠DGF is 65 degrees. But according to the RightAngle predicate, it should be 90 degrees. Contradiction. Therefore, this suggests that perhaps the second RightAngle is not applicable to ∠DGF, but to another angle. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses different notations for angles. 

Wait, maybe the Angle(D,G,F) is not ∠DGF but ∠FGD? Wait, no. The notation Angle(X,Y,Z) is always the angle at Y. So, Angle(D,G,F) is the angle at G between D and F, which is ∠DGF. So, the problem has conflicting information. This seems like a critical issue. However, since this is a problem presented to me, perhaps I need to proceed under the assumption that there's a misstatement and that one of the RightAngles is incorrect. 

Alternatively, perhaps the RightAngle(Angle(D,G,F)) refers to a different angle. Let me consider that maybe the second RightAngle is supposed to be for Angle(G,D,F), which would be ∠GDF. Wait, Angle(G,D,F) would be angle at D between G and F, which is ∠GDF. So, if the RightAngle(Angle(G,D,F)) is given, then ∠GDF is 90 degrees. Then, MeasureOf(Angle(D,G,F)) would refer to ∠DGF, which is different. 

This would resolve the contradiction. It's possible that there was a typo in the problem statement, and the second RightAngle was intended to be Angle(G,D,F), not Angle(D,G,F). Let me assume that possibility. Let me adjust accordingly.

Assuming that the RightAngle(Angle(G,D,F)) is the correct predicate, which means ∠GDF is a right angle. Then, the MeasureOf(Angle(D,G,F)) is referring to ∠DGF, which is another angle. 

With that adjustment, let's proceed. 

So, with that correction, we have:

- ∠EGD is 90° (right angle).

- ∠GDF is 90° (another right angle).

Now, the MeasureOf(Angle(D,G,F)) is 65°, which refers to ∠DGF. Let me confirm:

Angle(D,G,F) is the angle at G between D and F, which is ∠DGF. So, ∠DGF = 65°. 

So, with that, we can now analyze the figure. 

Points:

- D is connected to G and F (Line(D,G), Line(D,F)).

- G is connected to E and F (Line(G,F), Line(E,G)).

At point G, we have two right angles: ∠EGD (between E, G, D) is 90°, and ∠GDF (between G, D, F) is 90°. Wait, no—∠GDF is at D, between G and F. Wait, Angle(G,D,F) is the angle at D between G and F, so ∠GDF. So, ∠GDF is a right angle. 

So, at point D, we have ∠GDF = 90°, and at point G, we have ∠EGD = 90°. 

Additionally, we know that ∠EDG (which is the angle at D between E and G) is 25°, as per MeasureOf(Angle(E,D,G)) = 25°. 

Let me try to draw this mentally. Point D is connected to G and F. At point D, ∠GDF is 90°, so triangle DGF is a right triangle with right angle at D. Also, at point G, ∠EGD is 90°, so triangle EGD is a right triangle with right angle at G. 

Moreover, ∠EDG is 25°, which is the angle at D between E and G. So, in triangle EGD, which is right-angled at G, the angle at D is 25°, making the angle at E equal to 65°. 

Meanwhile, in triangle DGF, right-angled at D, the angle at D is 90°, and we might have other angles. Wait, but the MeasureOf(Angle(D,G,F)) is 65°, which is ∠DGF. Let me clarify:

∠DGF is the angle at G between D and F. So, in triangle DGF, which is right-angled at D, the angle at G (∠DGF) is 65°, which would make the third angle at F equal to 25°, since the angles in a triangle add up to 180°. 

So, triangle DGF: right-angled at D, with ∠DGF = 65°, so ∠DFG = 180 - 90 - 65 = 25°. 

Now, what about the rest of the figure? We have points E, G, D, F. 

Since ∠EDG is 25°, and ∠DFG is 25°, perhaps there's some relationship between these triangles. 

Now, the question asks for the measure of ∠1. However, the problem doesn't explicitly state what ∠1 refers to. This is a crucial missing piece. Wait, the original problem mentions "Find the measure of ∠1." But without knowing which angle ∠1 is, it's impossible to proceed. However, in many standard problems, especially those involving multiple angles and right triangles, ∠1 might refer to a specific angle formed by certain points. 

Given the provided predicates, let's look for angles that might be labeled as ∠1. Common scenarios include:

- The angle at G between E and F (∠EGF), which could be ∠1.

- The angle at F between D and G (∠DFG), which is 25° as computed earlier.

- The angle at E between D and G (∠DEG), which is 65° as computed earlier.

Alternatively, ∠1 could be the angle at E between G and F, or some other combination. However, since the problem includes various angles, I need to deduce based on the given data.

Alternatively, perhaps ∠1 refers to the angle at F between D and G (∠DFG), which we found to be 25°, but that's already covered. Or maybe ∠1 is ∠EGF, the angle at G between E and F. Let me explore that.

To find ∠EGF, which is the angle at G between E and F. To compute this, we can consider the sum of angles around point G. 

At point G, we have two angles: ∠EGD (which is 90°) and ∠DGF (which is 65°). These two angles are adjacent, forming the total angle at G between E and F. So, ∠EGF = ∠EGD + ∠DGF = 90° + 65° = 155°? Wait, but that would be if they are adjacent and on opposite sides. However, depending on the configuration, they might overlap. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Point G is connected to E, D, and F. From earlier, we have:

- ∠EGD is the angle at G between E and D (90°).

- ∠DGF is the angle at G between D and F (65°).

But since ∠DGF is part of triangle DGF, which is right-angled at D, and ∠EGD is part of triangle EGD, right-angled at G.

If we imagine point G with three lines: GE, GD, and GF. The angle between GE and GD is 90°, and the angle between GD and GF is 65°. Thus, the total angle between GE and GF would be the sum of those two angles: 90° + 65° = 155°. Therefore, ∠EGF = 155°, which seems quite large. But this depends on whether the angles are adjacent and on the same plane.

However, if the angles are on different planes or overlapping, this might not hold. But assuming they are in the same plane, this would be the case. However, in typical geometric diagrams, if you have two angles at a point, their sum would give the total angle between the outermost rays. So, if GE and GF are two rays from G, with GD in between, then ∠EGF = ∠EGD + ∠DGF = 90° + 65° = 155°. 

But none of the answer choices include 155°, so this suggests that ∠1 is not ∠EGF. Alternatively, maybe ∠1 refers to another angle.

Another possibility is that ∠1 is the angle at F between D and E, or some other angle. Wait, but the problem may involve triangle EGF or others. Let me consider the possibility that ∠1 is ∠EFG, which is the angle at F between E and G. 

To find that, we might need more information. Let's consider triangle EFG. But we don't have direct info on its angles yet. Alternatively, perhaps there are other triangles or relationships.

Alternatively, since we have two right triangles, EGD and DGF, maybe there's a larger triangle or quadrilateral involved. For instance, connecting E to F, creating triangle EGF. 

In that case, we might need to use the fact that the sum of angles in triangle EGF is 180°. But to do that, we'd need to find other angles in that triangle. 

Alternatively, since we have some angles in other triangles, maybe we can derive ∠1 through supplementary angles or other relations.

Wait, let's recap what we know:

- In triangle EGD (right-angled at G):

   - ∠EGD = 90°

   - ∠EDG = 25°

   - Therefore, ∠DEG = 180 - 90 - 25 = 65°

- In triangle DGF (right-angled at D):

   - ∠GDF = 90°

   - ∠DGF = 65°

   - Therefore, ∠DFG = 180 - 90 - 65 = 25°

So, ∠DFG is 25°, which is the angle at F between D and G. 

Now, if we consider triangle DFG, which has ∠DFG = 25°, ∠GDF = 90°, and ∠DGF = 65°. 

What about triangle EFG? Let me see. If we connect E to F, then we can consider triangle EFG. What angles do we know in this triangle?

We know that ∠DEG is 65°, which is the angle at E between D and G. But how does that relate to ∠EFG? 

Alternatively, consider that points E, D, F are connected through various lines. If we can find some relationships between the triangles, maybe we can find ∠1. 

Wait, if we consider line EF, and points D connected to both E and F, forming triangles EGD and DGF. Let me think about the coordinates of these points to model it mathematically.

Let me assign coordinates to make it concrete. Assume point G is at the origin (0,0). Since ∠EGD is 90°, and ∠GDF is 90°, we can place points accordingly.

Let’s set:

- Point G at (0, 0).

Since ∠EGD is 90°, and ∠GDF is 90°, we can assume that GD is along the y-axis, and GF is along the x-axis. Wait, but if ∠EGD is 90°, then GE and GD are perpendicular. If GD is along the y-axis, then GE would be along the x-axis. Similarly, ∠GDF is 90°, so GF and GD are perpendicular. Since GD is along the y-axis, GF would be along the x-axis. Wait, but that would mean that GE and GF are both along the x-axis, which would make them colinear. But then points E and F would lie on the same line through G, which would make EF a straight line. However, this might complicate things.

Alternatively, let me define GD as the positive y-axis. Then, since ∠EGD is 90°, GE would be along the positive x-axis. So, point E is somewhere along the x-axis. Similarly, since ∠GDF is 90°, GF would be along the negative x-axis (to keep GD along the y-axis and GF perpendicular to it). So, point F is on the negative x-axis. 

Thus:

- G: (0,0)

- D: (0, d) for some d > 0 (along the y-axis)

- E: (e, 0) for some e > 0 (on the positive x-axis)

- F: (-f, 0) for some f > 0 (on the negative x-axis)

Now, let's verify the given angles.

First, ∠EDG is the angle at D between E and G. Let's calculate that. 

Point D is at (0, d), E is at (e, 0), G is at (0,0).

Vector DE is from D to E: (e - 0, 0 - d) = (e, -d).

Vector DG is from D to G: (0 - 0, 0 - d) = (0, -d).

The angle between vectors DE and DG at point D is ∠EDG. Let's compute this angle.

Using the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (DE · DG) / (|DE| |DG|)

DE · DG = (e)(0) + (-d)(-d) = d²

|DE| = sqrt(e² + d²)

|DG| = sqrt(0² + (-d)^2) = d

Thus,

cos(theta) = d² / (sqrt(e² + d²) * d) ) = d / sqrt(e² + d²)

So theta = arccos(d / sqrt(e² + d²)) = arctan(e/d)

Because tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent = e/d, so theta = arctan(e/d)

According to the problem, this angle is 25 degrees. So:

arctan(e/d) = 25° => e/d = tan(25°) => e = d * tan(25°)

Now, consider triangle DGF, which is right-angled at D. Point F is at (-f, 0), D at (0, d), G at (0,0).

Vector DF is from D to F: (-f - 0, 0 - d) = (-f, -d)

Vector DG is from D to G: (0 - 0, 0 - d) = (0, -d)

Angle at D between G and F is ∠GDF, which is 90°, as given. Wait, but earlier we thought ∠GDF is 90°, which fits with the right angle.

Now, the measure of ∠DGF is given as 65°. ∠DGF is the angle at G between D and F. So, in triangle DGF, at point G, angle between D and F.

Point G is at (0,0), D is at (0,d), F is at (-f,0).

Vector GD is from G to D: (0 - 0, d - 0) = (0, d)

Vector GF is from G to F: (-f - 0, 0 - 0) = (-f, 0)

The angle between GD and GF at point G is ∠DGF. Let's compute this angle.

Vectors GD = (0, d), GF = (-f, 0)

Dot product: (0)(-f) + (d)(0) = 0

Wait, the dot product is zero, which means the vectors are perpendicular. Therefore, ∠DGF is 90°, but the problem says it's 65°. Contradiction again! 

This indicates a fundamental issue. According to the coordinate system, ∠DGF is 90°, but the problem states it's 65°. This suggests that my assumption about the placement of points is incorrect, or there's a miscalculation. 

Wait, let me re-examine the calculation of ∠DGF. 

Wait, ∠DGF is the angle at G between D and F. So, vectors are GD and GF. GD is from G to D: (0, d). GF is from G to F: (-f, 0). The angle between these vectors is indeed 90°, since their dot product is zero. This suggests that ∠DGF is 90°, conflicting with the given measure of 65°. 

This contradiction implies that there's a flaw in the assumptions. Perhaps the initial assumption about the placement of points is wrong. Let me reconsider the configuration. 

Maybe the right angles are not at the points I assumed. Earlier, I assumed that ∠EGD is 90° and ∠GDF is 90°, leading to ∠DGF being 90°, which conflicts with the given measure. Therefore, there must be an alternative configuration. 

Perhaps the second right angle is not at D but at F? Let me revisit the predicates. 

The given RightAngle(Angle(D,G,F)) is supposed to indicate a right angle at G, but if that leads to a contradiction, maybe it's a right angle at F? But the notation Angle(D,G,F) is angle at G. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem contains a mix-up between Angle(D,G,F) and Angle(F,G,D)? Let me check. 

If the second RightAngle is for Angle(F,G,D), which is the angle at G between F and D, which is the same as ∠DGF. Still the same issue. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem has a different structure. Let me think differently. Suppose that the two right angles are at different points. 

Wait, the problem states:

- RightAngle(Angle(E,G,D)) → ∠EGD is right.

- RightAngle(Angle(D,G,F)) → ∠DGF is right.

But if these are both right angles, then in the previous coordinate system, ∠DGF is 90°, which contradicts the given measure of 65°. This suggests that either the problem has a typo, or the angle in question is not ∠DGF but another angle. 

Alternatively, perhaps the MeasureOf(Angle(D,G,F)) is not ∠DGF but ∠FGD? Wait, ∠FGD is the same as ∠DGF. 

Alternatively, maybe the measure is referring to a different angle. Let me think: perhaps the angle at F between G and D, which would be ∠DFG, which we previously calculated as 25°. But why would that be referred to as Angle(D,G,F)? 

No, Angle(D,G,F) is at G. 

At this point, given the time spent and the contradictions arising from the given data, I'll have to proceed under the assumption that there was a mistake in the problem statement and that the second RightAngle should be for a different angle. Let's assume that the second RightAngle is for Angle(G,D,F), which is the angle at D between G and F, i.e., ∠GDF. 

With that assumption, the RightAngle(Angle(G,D,F)) means ∠GDF is 90°, and the MeasureOf(Angle(D,G,F)) is 65°, which refers to ∠DGF. 

This resolves the contradiction. Proceeding with this corrected assumption:

- ∠EGD = 90° (at G)

- ∠GDF = 90° (at D)

- ∠DGF = 65° (at G)

Now, let's re-analyze. 

At point D, ∠GDF is 90°, so triangle DGF is right-angled at D. At point G, ∠EGD is 90°, so triangle EGD is right-angled at G. 

Measure of ∠EDG is 25°, which is the angle at D between E and G in triangle EGD. 

In triangle EGD, right-angled at G, with ∠EDG = 25°, so the remaining angle at E is 65°. 

In triangle DGF, right-angled at D, with ∠DGF = 65°, so the remaining angle at F is 25°. 

Now, what is ∠1? If ∠1 is the angle at F between D and G, which is 25°, then the answer would be A. But 25° is one of the options. However, the answer choices include 25 (A), 55 (B), 65 (C), 75 (D). 

Alternatively, if ∠1 is the angle at E between D and G, which is 65°, then answer C. Or if it's the angle at G between E and F, which would be the sum of ∠EGD and ∠DGF, which is 90° + 65° = 155°, which isn't among the options. 

Alternatively, perhaps ∠1 is the angle at F between E and G. To find this, let's consider triangle EFG. 

If we can find ∠EFG, that might be ∠1. To find that, we need more information. 

Consider that points E, D, F are connected through various lines. Let me think about the full diagram. 

From earlier, we have:

- Triangle EGD: right-angled at G, with ∠EDG = 25°, ∠DEG = 65°.

- Triangle DGF: right-angled at D, with ∠DGF = 65°, ∠DFG = 25°.

Now, let's consider line EF. Points E and F are connected through G? Or not? Not necessarily. But if we connect E to F, we can examine triangle EFG. 

In triangle EFG, we might need to find ∠EFG. To do that, we can use the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, but we need to know other angles. 

Let me consider the coordinates again, assuming the corrected configuration where ∠GDF is 90° and ∠DGF is 65°. 

Let me redefine the coordinates with this new understanding. 

Let me place point D at (0,0). 

Since ∠GDF is 90°, and ∠DGF is 65°, let's set up the points such that:

- Point D is at (0,0).

- Since ∠GDF is 90°, and ∠DGF is 65°, let's position points G and F such that GD and DF are perpendicular. 

Let me set:

- Point D at (0,0).

- Point G at (a, 0), so that GD is along the x-axis from D(0,0) to G(a,0).

- Since ∠GDF is 90°, DF is perpendicular to GD. Since GD is along x-axis, DF is vertical. Let me set point F at (0, b), so that DF is vertical from D(0,0) to F(0,b). 

Now, ∠DGF is the angle at G between D and F. 

Point G is at (a, 0), D is at (0,0), F is at (0, b). 

So vector GD is from G to D: (-a, 0).

Vector GF is from G to F: (-a, b).

The angle between GD and GF at G is ∠DGF, which is given as 65°. 

Let's calculate this angle using the dot product.

Vector GD = D - G = (0 - a, 0 - 0) = (-a, 0)

Vector GF = F - G = (0 - a, b - 0) = (-a, b)

Dot product of GD and GF is (-a)(-a) + (0)(b) = a².

Magnitude of GD is sqrt((-a)^2 + 0^2) = a.

Magnitude of GF is sqrt((-a)^2 + b^2) = sqrt(a² + b²).

So cos(theta) = (a²) / (a * sqrt(a² + b²)) = a / sqrt(a² + b²).

This equals cos(65°), so:

a / sqrt(a² + b²) = cos(65°)

Square both sides:

a² / (a² + b²) = cos²(65°)

=> a² = cos²(65°) * (a² + b²)

=> a² = a² cos²(65°) + b² cos²(65°)

Rearranging:

a² (1 - cos²(65°)) = b² cos²(65°)

=> a² sin²(65°) = b² cos²(65°)

=> (a/b)² = cot²(65°)

=> a/b = cot(65°)

cot(65°) = 1/tan(65°) ≈ 1/2.1445 ≈ 0.4663

So a/b ≈ 0.4663 => b/a ≈ 2.1445.

Now, let's consider the other condition: ∠EDG = 25°, which is the angle at D between E and G. 

Point D is at (0,0). Point G is at (a,0). Point E is somewhere such that ∠EDG is 25°. 

Since ∠EDG is the angle at D between E and G, and D is at (0,0), G is at (a,0). So, the angle between DE and DG at D is 25°. 

Assume point E is somewhere in the plane. Let me choose coordinates for E. Let's say E is at (0, c), but that would make DE along the y-axis, and DG along x-axis, making the angle between them 90°, which is not 25°. So, E must be placed such that DE forms a 25° angle with DG. 

Let me assume that E is somewhere in the plane such that line DE makes 25° with DG (which is along x-axis). So, if DG is along x-axis from D(0,0) to G(a,0), then DE makes 25° above the x-axis. So, point E could be at (d, e) such that the angle between DE and DG is 25°. 

For simplicity, let me assume DE has length k, and makes 25° with x-axis. So, coordinates of E can be expressed as D + k*(cos(25°), sin(25°)) = (k*cos(25°), k*sin(25°)). 

So, point E is at (k*cos(25°), k*sin(25°)). 

Now, with this setup, we have:

- Point D: (0,0)

- Point G: (a, 0)

- Point F: (0, b)

- Point E: (k*cos(25°), k*sin(25°))

Now, we need to ensure that all conditions are satisfied. 

Additionally, we have the relationship from earlier: a/b = cot(65°), so b = a / cot(65°) = a * tan(65°). 

Let me compute tan(65°) ≈ 2.1445, so b ≈ 2.1445a.

Now, let's consider the full diagram. 

Now, what is ∠1? Without knowing which angle it is, it's challenging. But common possibilities include ∠EFG, ∠DEG, or others. 

Let me consider ∠EFG, the angle at F between E and G. To find this, we can use coordinates. 

Point F is at (0, b). 

Point E is at (k*cos(25°), k*sin(25°)).

Point G is at (a, 0).

Vector FE is from F to E: (k*cos(25°) - 0, k*sin(25°) - b) = (k*cos(25°), k*sin(25°) - b)

Vector FG is from F to G: (a - 0, 0 - b) = (a, -b)

The angle at F between E and G is ∠EFG, which we want to find. 

To calculate this angle, we can use the dot product between vectors FE and FG.

Let me denote vector FE as (x1, y1) = (k*cos(25°), k*sin(25°) - b)

Vector FG as (x2, y2) = (a, -b)

The cosine of ∠EFG is (FE · FG) / (|FE| |FG|)

Compute FE · FG = x1*x2 + y1*y2 = k*a*cos(25°) + (k*sin(25°) - b)*(-b)

= ka cos(25°) - b*k*sin(25°) + b²

|FE| = sqrt(x1² + y1²) = sqrt(k² cos²(25°) + (k sin(25°) - b)^2 )

|FG| = sqrt(a² + b²)

This expression is complicated, but perhaps we can simplify by choosing specific values for a and k to satisfy the earlier relation. 

Let me set a = 1 for simplicity, then b = tan(65°) ≈ 2.1445. Let's choose k such that the coordinates are manageable. Let's set k = 1 for simplicity. 

So, a = 1, b ≈ 2.1445, k = 1.

Point E: (cos(25°), sin(25°)) ≈ (0.9063, 0.4226)

Point F: (0, 2.1445)

Point G: (1, 0)

Now, compute vector FE: from F(0, 2.1445) to E(0.9063, 0.4226): (0.9063 - 0, 0.4226 - 2.1445) = (0.9063, -1.7219)

Vector FG: from F(0, 2.1445) to G(1, 0): (1 - 0, 0 - 2.1445) = (1, -2.1445)

Now, compute the dot product:

FE · FG = (0.9063)(1) + (-1.7219)(-2.1445) ≈ 0.9063 + 3.684 ≈ 4.5903

|FE| = sqrt(0.9063² + (-1.7219)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.8214 + 2.964) ≈ sqrt(3.7854) ≈ 1.945

|FG| = sqrt(1² + (2.1445)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 + 4.598) ≈ sqrt(5.598) ≈ 2.366

So, cos(angle) = 4.5903
