Okay, let's tackle this trapezoid area problem. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have a trapezoid ABCD. So, points A, B, C, D form a trapezoid. The first predicate says Trapezoid(A,B,C,D). Then, it mentions that Line(A,D) is parallel to Line(C,B). That means AD || BC because those are the two bases of the trapezoid? Wait, in a trapezoid, only one pair of sides is parallel. But here, AD and BC are parallel. So AD and BC are the two bases.

Next, we have some length equalities. Length of AC is 16, BD is 6, EB is 12. Also, there's a right angle at Angle(E,B,C), and E is such that EB is an altitude of the trapezoid. Hmm. So point E is somewhere, maybe on side AB or DC? Wait, since EB is an altitude, that would mean that EB is perpendicular to the base. Since it's an altitude of the trapezoid, which has bases AD and BC. Wait, but which base?

Wait, the trapezoid has two bases, AD and BC. The altitude would be the distance between these two bases. But if EB is an altitude, then EB must be perpendicular to both bases. However, the right angle is at Angle(E,B,C), so point E is connected to B and C. Wait, angle at B, between E and C. So point E is connected to B and C, forming a right angle at B. So triangle EBC is a right triangle with right angle at B. And EB is part of the altitude. 

So, since EB is an altitude, its length should be equal to the height of the trapezoid. Given that LengthOf(Line(E,B)) is 12, so the height h = 12. Wait, but then why do they give the lengths of AC and BD? Maybe those diagonals? Or perhaps there's more to it. Wait, AC is a diagonal from A to C, and BD is another diagonal from B to D. Their lengths are 16 and 6 respectively. Hmm. 

But the area of a trapezoid is given by (base1 + base2)/2 * height. We know the height is 12 (from EB being the altitude). But we need the lengths of the two bases, AD and BC. Alternatively, maybe we can find them using the diagonals and other info.

Alternatively, since EB is an altitude, and it's perpendicular to the bases. Let me try to visualize the trapezoid. Let me sketch mentally. Points A and D are on one base, B and C on the other. AD || BC. The legs are AB and CD. Now, E is a point such that EB is perpendicular to BC and AD. Since angle at B is right, so E is somewhere along the leg AB? Wait, if EB is perpendicular to BC, then since BC is a base, EB is vertical if BC is horizontal. Wait, but angle at B between E and C is right. So if we imagine BC as horizontal, then BE is vertical upwards from B. Therefore, E lies outside the trapezoid? Because in a trapezoid, the legs are AB and CD. If BE is an altitude, then E must lie on the leg AB extended? Or maybe on AB itself?

Wait, if E is such that EB is an altitude, then EB must be perpendicular to the bases. So, if BC is one base, then EB is perpendicular to BC. So, since BC is a base, and EB is perpendicular to it, then E lies on the line perpendicular to BC at point B. Similarly, since AD is parallel to BC, EB is also perpendicular to AD. Therefore, EB is the height of the trapezoid. So the height h = 12. 

Now, to compute the area, we need the sum of the two bases multiplied by 12 divided by 2. So if I can find the lengths of AD and BC, then I can compute the area. 

But how to get those lengths? We have the diagonals AC = 16 and BD = 6. Let me think about the properties of trapezoids. In a trapezoid, the formula involving the diagonals and the bases... Not sure. Maybe coordinate geometry could help here. Let me assign coordinates to the points.

Let me set up a coordinate system. Let’s place point B at the origin (0,0). Since BC is a base, and EB is perpendicular to BC. Let’s assume BC is horizontal. Then, since EB is vertical. Let me define coordinates accordingly.

Let’s suppose BC is along the x-axis. Let’s say point B is at (0,0). Then, since EB is an altitude, and it's perpendicular to BC, point E would be directly above B. Since EB is length 12, then E is at (0,12). Wait, but angle at B is right, so angle EBC is 90 degrees. So, if BC is horizontal from B(0,0) to C(c,0), then BE goes upward from B(0,0) to E(0,12). Then EC connects E(0,12) to C(c,0). But wait, the right angle is at B, so the lines BE and BC are perpendicular. So yes, BE is vertical, BC is horizontal.

Now, since AD is parallel to BC, AD is also horizontal. Let me denote coordinates for A and D. Since AD is the other base. Let me think about the trapezoid. The trapezoid has vertices A, B, C, D. Let me consider the order. Typically, trapezoid ABCD is ordered such that AB and CD are the legs, and AD and BC are the bases. So, assuming the order A-B-C-D-A. So AD and BC are the two bases.

Given that, point A is connected to D, and point D is connected to C. So if AD is horizontal (parallel to BC), then D must be to the left of A? Or depends on direction.

Alternatively, maybe better to use coordinates. Let me proceed.

Set B at (0,0), C at (c,0) for some c. Then E is at (0,12). Now, since AD is parallel to BC, which is horizontal. So AD is horizontal. Let me denote coordinates for A and D. Suppose point A is at (a, 12), since the height is 12 (since EB is the altitude). Wait, but the height is the distance between the two bases. So if BC is at y=0, then AD is at y=h=12. Therefore, points A and D lie on the line y=12. So coordinates for A: (p,12), D: (q,12).

Then, since AD is a base, its length is |q - p|. And BC is from (0,0) to (c,0), so length is c.

Now, the other sides: AB connects A(p,12) to B(0,0), and CD connects D(q,12) to C(c,0).

Also, we have diagonals AC and BD. Let me write their coordinates.

Diagonal AC connects A(p,12) to C(c,0). Its length is sqrt[(c - p)^2 + (0 - 12)^2] = sqrt[(c-p)^2 + 144]. This is given as 16. So:

sqrt[(c - p)^2 + 144] = 16 → square both sides: (c - p)^2 + 144 = 256 → (c - p)^2 = 112 → c - p = ±√112 = ±4√7. Let me note that.

Similarly, diagonal BD connects B(0,0) to D(q,12). Its length is sqrt[(q - 0)^2 + (12 - 0)^2] = sqrt[q² + 144]. Given as 6. So:

sqrt(q² + 144) = 6 → q² + 144 = 36 → q² = -108. Wait, that's impossible! Negative value under square root. That can't be. There's a contradiction here. Did I make a mistake?

Hmm. Wait, maybe my assumption about where point D is located is wrong. If the trapezoid is ABCD, then the order matters. Maybe the trapezoid is not convex? Or maybe I got the direction of the bases wrong. Let me check again.

Wait, the problem states that AD and BC are parallel. So AD || BC. So if AD is the upper base and BC is the lower base. But if I assumed AD is horizontal, then BC is horizontal. But if BD is a diagonal from B to D, and if D is on the upper base, then coordinates of D would be (something, 12). But according to the calculation, BD length squared is q² + 144 = 36 → q² = -108. Which is impossible. Hence, something is wrong here. Where did I go wrong?

Ah! Wait, maybe I messed up the coordinates. Let me re-examine.

The problem says that EB is an altitude of the trapezoid. So, the altitude is the distance between the two bases. So, if BC is a base, then the altitude is the distance from BC to AD. Since EB is the altitude, then the length of EB is equal to the height of the trapezoid, which is 12. So the vertical distance between BC and AD is 12. Therefore, if BC is at y=0, then AD is at y=12. Therefore, points A and D are on y=12. 

But then, BD is a diagonal connecting B(0,0) to D(x,y), where y=12. So coordinates of D would be (d_x, 12). Then BD length is sqrt( (d_x - 0)^2 + (12 - 0)^2 ) = sqrt(d_x² + 144) = 6. Therefore, d_x² + 144 = 36 → d_x² = -108. Which is impossible. Contradiction. So this suggests that my initial assumption about the position of D is incorrect. 

Alternative possibility: Perhaps the altitude is not from B but from E to the base. Wait, the problem says IsAltitudeOf(Line(E,B),Trapezoid(A,B,C,D)). So Line EB is an altitude of the trapezoid. That means that EB is perpendicular to the bases and connects a vertex to the opposite base. Wait, but in a trapezoid, altitudes are usually drawn from one base to the other. So, if EB is an altitude, then it must connect the base BC to the opposite base AD. But since E is a point such that EB is perpendicular to BC. Wait, earlier assumption was that BC is horizontal, and EB is vertical. But if EB is an altitude, then it should be perpendicular to both bases. But if BC is a base, then AD is parallel to BC, so EB is perpendicular to BC and hence to AD. Thus, the length of EB is the height. 

However, in this case, the coordinates led to a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the error is in assuming that the trapezoid is oriented with BC as the lower base and AD as the upper base. Maybe the other way around? Suppose AD is the lower base and BC is the upper base. Wait, but the parallelism is given as AD || BC. So either orientation is possible. Let me try flipping the roles. 

Suppose AD is the lower base (y=0) and BC is the upper base (y=12). Then, the altitude EB would be from point B to the lower base AD. Wait, but angle at B is between E and C. If BC is the upper base, then point C is on the upper base, so if we draw EB as an altitude down to AD, then E would be on AD. But then angle at B would involve line BC and BE. Wait, but if E is on AD, then BE connects B to E on AD, making angle at B between BE and BC. For that angle to be right, BE must be perpendicular to BC. So if BC is horizontal (upper base), then BE is vertical downward. Let me try this setup.

Let me redefine coordinates. Let me take AD as the lower base (y=0) and BC as the upper base (y=12). Let me place point B at (b_x, 12), since it's on the upper base. Then, since EB is an altitude, going down to AD. So E is on AD, which is at y=0. The length of EB is 12, so the vertical distance from B to AD is 12. Therefore, if B is at (x,12), then E is directly below B on AD, so E is at (x,0). But angle at B is between BE and BC. Since BC is horizontal (as upper base), then BE is vertical down. Therefore, angle between BE (vertical) and BC (horizontal) is 90 degrees, which satisfies the right angle condition. 

So, in this scenario, point E is on AD. So coordinates: AD is from A(a_x, 0) to D(d_x, 0). Point B is at (b_x, 12), and point C is at (c_x, 12). Since BC is the upper base, so BC connects B(b_x,12) to C(c_x,12). 

Now, the diagonal AC connects A(a_x,0) to C(c_x,12), and its length is 16. Diagonal BD connects B(b_x,12) to D(d_x,0), and its length is 6. Also, the length of EB is 12, which is the vertical segment from B(b_x,12) to E(b_x,0), so that's consistent. 

So let's work with this setup. Let me write equations for diagonals AC and BD.

First, diagonal AC: from A(a_x, 0) to C(c_x,12). The length squared is (c_x - a_x)^2 + (12 - 0)^2 = (c_x - a_x)^2 + 144 = 16^2 = 256. Therefore:

(c_x - a_x)^2 + 144 = 256 ⇒ (c_x - a_x)^2 = 112 ⇒ c_x - a_x = √112 or -√112. Let's keep it as ±4√7 for now.

Second, diagonal BD: from B(b_x,12) to D(d_x,0). Length squared is (d_x - b_x)^2 + (0 - 12)^2 = (d_x - b_x)^2 + 144 = 6^2 = 36. Therefore:

(d_x - b_x)^2 + 144 = 36 ⇒ (d_x - b_x)^2 = -108. Again, same problem. Impossible. 

Wait, that's the same contradiction as before. What's happening here? It seems like regardless of whether AD or BC is the lower base, the diagonal BD leads to an impossible equation. So there must be a different configuration. 

Perhaps my assumption that E lies on AD or BC is wrong? Wait, the problem states that EB is an altitude of the trapezoid. An altitude of a trapezoid is a line segment perpendicular to the bases, connecting a base to the opposite side. So, if EB is an altitude, then E must lie on one of the bases, and B is on the other base. Wait, but B is already a vertex. So if EB is an altitude, then E must be on the opposite base from B. Since B is on one base, then E is on the other base. So if B is on base BC, then E is on base AD. Wait, but in the previous setups, that led to contradictions. 

Alternatively, maybe the trapezoid is not convex? Or maybe E is not on the base but on an extension of the base? Let me think. If the trapezoid is such that the altitude extends beyond the base. For example, if the trapezoid is obtuse, the foot of the altitude may lie outside the base. 

Let me consider that possibility. Suppose that the base BC is longer than the projection of the other base. For instance, if AD is shorter than BC, then the altitude might extend beyond the base. 

Let me try again. Let's assume that AD is the lower base (y=0), and BC is the upper base (y=12). Point B is on the upper base, and E is the foot of the altitude from B to AD, but lying outside the segment AD. So E is not between A and D but beyond one of them. 

In this case, the length of EB is still 12. Let me define coordinates again. Let me assume AD is from A(a,0) to D(d,0). Point B is on the upper base at (x,12), and E is the foot of the perpendicular from B to AD. Since AD is horizontal, E is vertically below B, so E has coordinates (x,0). But if E lies outside AD, then x < a or x > d. 

Now, diagonal BD connects B(x,12) to D(d,0). The length of BD is 6. So distance between (x,12) and (d,0):

sqrt[(d - x)^2 + (0 - 12)^2] = sqrt[(d - x)^2 + 144] = 6. Squaring gives (d - x)^2 + 144 = 36 ⇒ (d - x)^2 = -108. Still impossible. So even allowing E outside AD doesn't resolve the issue. 

This suggests that there is a fundamental error in my assumptions. Let me reconsider the entire setup. 

Maybe the trapezoid isn't defined with AD and BC as the bases. Wait, the predicate says Parallel(Line(A,D), Line(C,B)), so AD || CB. So AD is parallel to CB. So CB is the same as BC, just reversed. So the two bases are AD and BC. 

Wait, but maybe the trapezoid is crossed? No, trapezoid is typically simple. 

Another thought: Could the diagonals intersect at some point, and use that to find relations? Or maybe using the fact that in a trapezoid, the product of the segments of the diagonals? Not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the lengths given are not of the diagonals but of the legs? Wait, the problem says Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C)),16) — so AC is a diagonal. Similarly BD is another diagonal. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the diagonals. Let me confirm: In a trapezoid, the diagonals are AC and BD, connecting opposite vertices. So if the trapezoid is ABCD, then diagonals are AC and BD. 

But in both cases, the calculation led to impossible results. So maybe there's a miscalculation. Let me check again. 

For diagonal BD: sqrt[(d - x)^2 + 144] = 6 → squared: (d-x)^2 + 144 = 36 → (d-x)^2 = -108. No, that's still negative. So unless there's a mistake in assigning coordinates. 

Wait, what if the trapezoid is not right-angled? But we have a right angle at EBC. Wait, angle at B between E and C is right. So triangle EBC is right-angled at B. So in this case, if B is at (x,12), C is at (c,12), and E is at (x,0), then EC is from (x,0) to (c,12). So EC has length sqrt((c - x)^2 + 12^2). But we don't have info about EC. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to relate the diagonals with the right triangle. Let me think. 

Since AC is a diagonal of length 16, BD is 6. Maybe using the Pythagorean theorem? Or perhaps applying some property of trapezoids with right angles?

Wait, in a trapezoid with a right angle at B, but that's not necessarily a right trapezoid. Wait, but there is a right angle at EBC. So if we consider triangle EBC, which is right-angled at B. So BE is one leg (length 12), BC is the other leg, and EC is the hypotenuse. So EC = sqrt(12^2 + BC^2). 

But we don't know BC's length. However, BC is one of the bases. Let me denote BC as length 'a', and AD as length 'b'. Then, the area would be ((a + b)/2)*12. 

But we need to find a and b. How? 

We have the diagonals AC = 16 and BD = 6. Let me try expressing the diagonals in terms of a and b.

Assume the trapezoid has bases AD = b and BC = a. Height h = 12. The legs are AB and CD. 

But without knowing the legs' lengths or angles, it's hard to relate diagonals to the bases. However, there's the right triangle EBC. From earlier, EC = sqrt(12^2 + a^2). 

But EC is also part of the diagonal AC? Wait, no. AC is from A to C. Let me think about coordinates again, but this time considering the right triangle. 

Let me place point B at (0,0), and since EB is the altitude, which is 12 units long, and perpendicular to BC. Let me assume BC is horizontal. So B is at (0,0), C is at (a,0) (so BC = a). Then, since EB is perpendicular to BC, E is at (0,12). 

Now, AD is parallel to BC, so AD is horizontal. Let me find coordinates for A and D. Since the trapezoid is ABCD, the order implies that AD and BC are the bases, with AB and CD as legs. So, point A is connected to B and D. Since AD is parallel to BC, and AD is horizontal. Let me assume that D is at (d,12), and A is at (e,12), so that AD has length |d - e| = b. 

But then, AB connects A(e,12) to B(0,0). CD connects D(d,12) to C(a,0). 

Now, diagonal AC connects A(e,12) to C(a,0), and its length is 16. So:

AC: sqrt[(a - e)^2 + (0 - 12)^2] = 16 → (a - e)^2 + 144 = 256 → (a - e)^2 = 112 → a - e = ±√112 = ±4√7.

Diagonal BD connects B(0,0) to D(d,12), and its length is 6. So:

BD: sqrt[(d - 0)^2 + (12 - 0)^2] = sqrt[d² + 144] = 6 → d² + 144 = 36 → d² = -108. Again, impossible. 

Same problem as before. So why is this happening? It seems that the given lengths of the diagonals lead to an inconsistency. Unless there's a misunderstanding in the setup. 

Wait, could the diagonals be AE and BD? No, the problem says LengthOf(Line(A,C)) and LengthOf(Line(B,D)). So AC and BD. 

Is there a possibility that the trapezoid is not convex? Or that the points are arranged differently? Maybe the order of the trapezoid is different. Like A-B-C-D-A, but with AD and BC not adjacent? No, that wouldn't make sense. 

Alternatively, perhaps the trapezoid is degenerate? Unlikely, since it has a right angle. 

Wait, maybe the problem uses a different definition of trapezoid, where only one pair of sides is parallel, and the other sides are non-parallel. But even so, the calculations suggest impossibility. 

Wait, maybe the length of BD is not from B to D, but from B to another point? No, the predicate says Line(B,D), so it's from B to D. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to consider that the trapezoid is a rectangle? No, because it has a right angle at EBC, but not necessarily at the corners. 

Wait, but if it were a rectangle, then all angles would be right angles, and diagonals would be equal. Here, diagonals are 16 and 6, which are unequal, so it's not a rectangle. 

Another idea: Maybe the trapezoid is not isosceles, and the diagonals are not symmetric. But even so, the math still leads to a contradiction. 

Wait, let me think about the right triangle EBC. Since it's right-angled at B, with legs BE = 12 and BC = a (if BC is the base). Then EC = sqrt(12^2 + a^2). Now, EC is also the hypotenuse of this triangle. But how does this relate to the diagonals? 

Looking back at diagonal AC: from A to C. If I can express AC in terms of other variables. 

Let me try to find coordinates again, but this time accept that there's a mistake in my setup. Let me suppose that the trapezoid has AD parallel to BC, with AD and BC being the two bases. Let me denote AD = x, BC = y. Height h = 12. Area = (x + y)/2 * 12 = 6(x + y). Need to find x + y. 

Now, how to relate x and y with the diagonals AC = 16 and BD = 6. 

In a trapezoid, the formula for the length of the diagonal can be found using the formula: 

For diagonal AC: 
AC² = AB² + BC² - 2*AB*BC*cos(theta), where theta is the angle between AB and BC. But I don't know AB or theta. 

Alternatively, using coordinates. Let me try once more with a different coordinate setup. 

Let me place point B at (0,0), and since EB is the altitude, which is 12, and perpendicular to BC. Let me assume BC is horizontal. So B is at (0,0), C is at (c,0), E is at (0,12). AD is parallel to BC, so AD is horizontal. Let me assume AD is at y = 12. Let me denote point A as (a,12) and D as (d,12). 

Now, AB connects A(a,12) to B(0,0). CD connects D(d,12) to C(c,0). 

Diagonal AC: from A(a,12) to C(c,0): length sqrt((c - a)^2 + (0 - 12)^2) = sqrt((c-a)^2 + 144) = 16 → (c - a)^2 + 144 = 256 → (c - a)^2 = 112 → c - a = ±4√7.

Diagonal BD: from B(0,0) to D(d,12): length sqrt((d - 0)^2 + (12 - 0)^2) = sqrt(d² + 144) = 6 → d² + 144 = 36 → d² = -108. Still impossible. 

This suggests that the given data is inconsistent? Or perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.

The given predicates are:

- Trapezoid(A,B,C,D)

- Parallel(Line(A,D), Line(C,B))

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C)),16)

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,D)),6)

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,B)),12)

- RightAngle(Angle(E,B,C))

- IsAltitudeOf(Line(E,B),Trapezoid(A,B,C,D))

Wait, maybe I misunderstood the "IsAltitudeOf" predicate. Maybe Line(E,B) is an altitude of the trapezoid, meaning it is perpendicular to one of the bases and connects a base to the other. So EB is an altitude, hence perpendicular to one base and meeting the other. 

So, if EB is an altitude, then it must be perpendicular to one base and meet the other. Let me assume that EB is perpendicular to AD and meets BC. Or vice versa. 

Let me try this: Assume that EB is perpendicular to AD and intersects BC at B. So, since AD is parallel to BC, EB is perpendicular to both. Thus, EB is the height, and its length is 12. 

So, if EB is perpendicular to AD, then AD is horizontal, and EB is vertical. Let me set coordinates with B at (0,0), and since EB is vertical, E is at (0,12). AD is horizontal, so it's at y = 12 or y = -12? Depends on direction. Let me assume AD is at y = 12. Then, points A and D are on y=12. 

Point B is at (0,0), and since EB is vertical from B(0,0) to E(0,12). Now, BC is parallel to AD, so BC is also horizontal. Since B is at (0,0), and BC is horizontal, then C is at (c,0). 

Now, AD is from A(a,12) to D(d,12). Now, the diagonal AC is from A(a,12) to C(c,0), length 16. So:

sqrt((c - a)^2 + (0 - 12)^2) = 16 → (c - a)^2 + 144 = 256 → (c - a)^2 = 112 → c - a = ±4√7.

Diagonal BD is from B(0,0) to D(d,12), length 6:

sqrt((d - 0)^2 + (12 - 0)^2) = sqrt(d² + 144) = 6 → d² + 144 = 36 → d² = -108. Still impossible. 

This is the same problem as before. So what's the issue here? It seems like the given lengths of the diagonals are conflicting with the existence of such a trapezoid. But since the problem provides these as premises, there must be a resolution. 

Wait, perhaps the trapezoid is not convex, and the points are arranged such that D is not on the same line as E? Or maybe the trapezoid is self-intersecting? 

Alternatively, could there be a miscalculation in assuming that both diagonals are AC and BD? Let me double-check. 

The problem says: Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C)),16) and Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,D)),6). Yes, those are diagonals. 

Wait, but maybe the trapezoid is not labeled in order? Like, maybe it's A-B-C-D-A, but with AD and BC being the non-consecutive sides? No, in a trapezoid, consecutive vertices are connected. 

Wait, perhaps the trapezoid has AD and BC as the non-parallel sides? No, the predicate says Parallel(Line(A,D), Line(C,B)), so AD || CB. 

Wait, maybe I need to consider that Line(C,B) is not the same as Line(B,C)? No, they are the same line. 

I'm really stuck here. Let me think differently. Maybe instead of coordinates, use vectors or other properties. 

Since EB is an altitude of length 12, the height h = 12. The area is (AD + BC)/2 * 12 = 6*(AD + BC). So if I can find AD + BC, multiply by 6 to get the area. 

Now, how to relate AD and BC with the diagonals AC = 16 and BD = 6. 

Let me recall that in a trapezoid, the length of the diagonals can be expressed using the formula:

AC² + BD² = AD² + BC² + 4h²

Wait, is there such a formula? I'm not sure. Let me derive it. 

Consider a trapezoid with bases AD = a, BC = b, height h. Let me denote the legs as AB and CD. Let me drop perpendiculars from A and D to BC, creating right triangles. Let me call the feet of these perpendiculars as P and Q. 

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, using coordinates again. 

Let me place the trapezoid with bases AD and BC, with AD = a, BC = b, height h = 12. Let me place it such that AD is on the x-axis from (0,0) to (a,0), and BC is parallel, at height h = 12, from (p,12) to (q,12), so BC has length q - p = b. 

Then, the coordinates are:

A(0,0), D(a,0), B(p,12), C(q,12). 

Now, the diagonals are AC and BD. 

AC: from A(0,0) to C(q,12): length sqrt(q² + 144) = 16 → q² + 144 = 256 → q² = 112.

BD: from B(p,12) to D(a,0): length sqrt((a - p)^2 + 144) = 6 → (a - p)^2 + 144 = 36 → (a - p)^2 = -108. Again, impossible. 

Same contradiction. So this suggests that the given data is impossible? But the problem is presented as solvable, so there must be an error in my understanding. 

Wait, perhaps the trapezoid is not having AD and BC as the two bases, but one of them is a leg? No, the predicate says they are parallel. 

Wait, maybe the line EB is not the full altitude, but part of it? Like, E is a point on the leg, not extending to the base? But the predicate says IsAltitudeOf(Line(E,B),Trapezoid(...)), which means Line EB is an altitude of the trapezoid, so it must connect a base to the opposite base. 

Wait, could the altitude be from E to BC, with B being on BC? No, because B is a vertex. 

Alternatively, maybe the trapezoid is such that EB is an altitude, but E is not on the base. Wait, but an altitude of a trapezoid must connect a base to the opposite base, so E must be on one base and B on the other. 

Wait, if B is on one base, and E is on the other base, then BE is the altitude. So, if B is on BC (which is a base), then E is on AD. So, let me try this. 

Let me assume AD is the base, and BC is the other base. Let me place AD horizontally, from A(0,0) to D(d,0). BC is parallel to AD, so it is also horizontal. Let me place B at (p, h) and C at (q, h), where h is the height. Since EB is an altitude, and B is on BC, then E must be on AD. So, E is the foot of the perpendicular from B to AD. So, since AD is horizontal, the perpendicular from B(p,h) to AD is vertical, so E has coordinates (p,0). 

Thus, BE is the vertical segment from (p,h) to (p,0), length h = 12. So h = 12. 

Now, the coordinates are:

A(0,0), D(d,0), B(p,12), C(q,12). 

Now, diagonal AC is from A(0,0) to C(q,12): length sqrt(q² + 144) = 16 → q² + 144 = 256 → q² = 112.

Diagonal BD is from B(p,12) to D(d,0): length sqrt((d - p)^2 + 144) = 6 → (d - p)^2 + 144 = 36 → (d - p)^2 = -108. Same problem!

This suggests that no matter how I arrange the points, the diagonal BD leads to an imaginary number. This indicates that the given data is inconsistent, which cannot be true since it's a problem to solve. 

Wait, but the problem includes the RightAngle(Angle(E,B,C)). So, angle at B between E and C is right. Let me use this. 

With the current setup, E is at (p,0), B is at (p,12), C is at (q,12). So vector BE is (0,-12), and vector BC is (q - p, 0). The angle between BE and BC is 90 degrees, which is satisfied since BE is vertical and BC is horizontal. So this condition is met. 

But the diagonal BD length still gives us an impossible equation. So, what is the solution? 

Maybe the error is in the assumption that the trapezoid has AD and BC as the two bases. Perhaps the parallel sides are AB and CD? No, the predicate says Parallel(Line(A,D), Line(C,B)), so AD || CB. 

Wait, perhaps the trapezoid is a parallelogram? If AD || CB and AB || CD, then it's a parallelogram. But in that case, diagonals would bisect each other and have equal lengths. But here, diagonals are 16 and 6, which are not equal. So it's not a parallelogram. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a right trapezoid, with one of the legs perpendicular to the bases. But we have a right angle at EBC, which might imply that. Let me see. 

If it's a right trapezoid, then one of the legs is perpendicular to the bases. Let's say AB is perpendicular to the bases. Then, AB is the height. But in this case, EB is also an altitude. If AB is perpendicular, then E could be point A or B? Not sure. 

Let me try. Assume AB is perpendicular to the bases, so AB is the height. Then, AB = 12, since EB is an altitude of length 12. But EB is part of AB? If E is on AB, then EB would be a part of AB. 

But the problem states that EB is an altitude, which would mean it is perpendicular to the bases. If AB is already perpendicular, then EB could be a portion of AB. But then, how does this fit with the other conditions? 

Let me try this setup. Let me assume AB is perpendicular to the bases. So, AB is vertical. Let me place point A at (0,0), B at (0,12), since AB is vertical with length 12. Now, since AD is parallel to BC, and AD and BC are the bases. Let me assume AD is horizontal. So, point D is at (d,0), and since AD is from A(0,0) to D(d,0), so AD has length d. 

Now, BC is parallel to AD, so it is horizontal. Point B is at (0,12), so point C is at (c,12), so BC has length c - 0 = c. 

Now, diagonal AC is from A(0,0) to C(c,12), length sqrt(c² + 144) = 16 → c² + 144 = 256 → c² = 112 → c = sqrt(112) = 4√7.

Diagonal BD is from B(0,12) to D(d,0), length sqrt((d - 0)^2 + (0 - 12)^2) = sqrt(d² + 144) = 6 → d² + 144 = 36 → d² = -108. Again, impossible! 

Same issue. 

This suggests that the given data is contradictory, but since it's a problem from a test, there must be a way. Perhaps the error is in assuming that both diagonals are given? Or perhaps the length of BD is not from B to D, but from B to another point? 

Wait, let me read the predicates again:

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C)),16)

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,D)),6)

Yes, those are the diagonals. 

Wait, perhaps the trapezoid is not convex, and the diagonal BD crosses through the interior, leading to a different calculation? No, the calculation remains the same. 

Wait, let me think about the area. Even though the diagonals seem impossible, maybe I can find the area indirectly. 

The area is 6*(AD + BC). If I can find AD + BC, I can compute it. 

From the diagonal AC: sqrt((c - a)^2 + 144) = 16 → (c - a)^2 = 112. 

From diagonal BD: sqrt(d² + 144) = 6 → d² = -108. 

If I ignore the second equation and focus on the first, (c - a)^2 = 112. But what is c - a? In the coordinate system where AD is from (0,0) to (a,0), and BC is from (0,12) to (c,12), then c is the length of BC, and a is the length of AD. So, if I assume that the difference between c and a is sqrt(112), but I don't know the relation between a and c. 

But how to relate this to the other diagonal? 

Wait, if I consider that in this setup, the length of BD is sqrt(d² + 144) = 6, but d is the length of AD, which is a. So, a² + 144 = 36 → a² = -108. 

This suggests that a is imaginary, which is impossible. 

But the problem must have a solution. Perhaps the error is in assuming that AD is the base and BC is the other base. Maybe the trapezoid is such that AD and BC are the legs, and the bases are AB and CD? No, because the predicate says they are parallel. 

Wait, the predicate says Parallel(Line(A,D), Line(C,B)), so AD || CB. So, if AD and CB are the bases, then AB and CD are the legs. 

But in this case, if AB and CD are the legs, and one of them is perpendicular, making it a right trapezoid. Let me try this. 

Let me assume that AB is perpendicular to the bases AD and CB. So, AB is the height, length 12. Let me place A at (0,0), B at (0,12), D at (d,0), and C at (c,12). Since AD is from A(0,0) to D(d,0), and CB is from C(c,12) to B(0,12). So CB is from (0,12) to (c,12), so its length is c. AD has length d. 

Now, diagonal AC is from A(0,0) to C(c,12), length sqrt(c² + 144) = 16 → c² + 144 = 256 → c² = 112 → c = 4√7. 

Diagonal BD is from B(0,12) to D(d,0), length sqrt(d² + 144) = 6 → d² + 144 = 36 → d² = -108. Still impossible. 

This is the same issue. 

Wait, but maybe the length of BD is not from B to D, but from B to another point? Or perhaps there's a typo in the problem? Or perhaps I'm missing something. 

Wait, let me think about the right angle at EBC. In this setup, with B at (0,12), C at (c,12), and E at (0,0) (since BE is the altitude). So, E is at (0,0), which is point A. Wait, if E is at (0,0), which is point A, then Line(E,B) is Line(A,B), which is the leg AB. But the predicate says IsAltitudeOf(Line(E,B),Trapezoid(A,B,C,D)), so Line(E,B) is an altitude. If E is A, then Line(E,B) is AB, which is already a leg and is perpendicular to the bases. So this fits. 

But in this case, the length of Line(E,B)
