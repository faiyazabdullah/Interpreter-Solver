MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a triangle ABC, and it's stated to be an isosceles triangle. Also, there's a right angle at point C, because the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(A, C, B)). Wait, Angle(A, C, B) would mean the angle at point C between points A and B. So that means angle C is the right angle. 

Since it's an isosceles triangle, two sides are equal. The predicates mention that the lengths of AB is 20 units, and the other two sides AC and BC are both x. Wait, but if it's an isosceles triangle with legs AC and BC being equal, then the hypotenuse would be AB. But since angle C is the right angle, that makes sense. In a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. So AB is the hypotenuse here.

So, applying the Pythagorean theorem here. For a right-angled triangle, the sum of squares of the legs equals the square of the hypotenuse. So, AC² + BC² = AB². Since AC and BC are both x, substituting gives x² + x² = 20². That simplifies to 2x² = 400. Dividing both sides by 2, x² = 200. Taking the square root, x = sqrt(200). Let me calculate that. sqrt(200) is sqrt(100*2) which is 10√2. Numerically, √2 is approximately 1.4142, so 10*1.4142 is about 14.142. Rounded to the nearest tenth, that's 14.1. Looking at the answer choices, option C is 14.1. So the answer should be C.

Wait, let me double-check. The triangle is isosceles with legs AC and BC equal, making AB the hypotenuse. Yes, because the right angle is at C, so legs are AC and BC. Therefore, the calculation holds. Another way: maybe I confused the sides? Suppose instead that the equal sides were AB and AC, but no, the problem states that the length of AB is 20, and AC and BC are both x. So yes, the legs are AC and BC, each x, hypotenuse AB=20. Hence, x = sqrt( (20^2)/2 ) = sqrt(200) ≈14.14, rounds to 14.1. So answer C.
