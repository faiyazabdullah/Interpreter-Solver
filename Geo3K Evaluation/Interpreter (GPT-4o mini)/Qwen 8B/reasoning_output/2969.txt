MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, the question says that we have minor arc AC with measure x and major arc ADC with measure y. We're told that the measure of angle ABC is 70 degrees, and we need to find x. The answer choices are A. 90, B. 100, C. 110, D. 120.

First, I need to visualize the diagram. Since there are arcs mentioned, it's probably involving a circle. Points A, C, D, and maybe others are on the circumference. The angle ABC is given, so point B must be outside or inside the circle? Wait, angle ABC—usually, angles in circles can be inscribed angles or something else. Let me think.

Inscribed angles relate to arcs. An inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. But if angle ABC is formed by two chords, BA and BC, then it would intercept some arc. However, since there are points A, C, D mentioned, maybe there's a triangle involved here. Also, the arcs mentioned are minor arc AC and major arc ADC. So, point D is another point on the circle such that ADC is a major arc passing through D.

Wait, major arc ADC implies that the arc goes from A to C passing through D, making it longer than a semicircle. Therefore, the entire circle is divided into two arcs: minor arc AC (which is x) and major arc ADC (which is y). Since the total circumference is 360 degrees, x + y = 360. But also, since ADC is the major arc, y should be greater than 180, while x is less than 180.

Now, angle ABC is given as 70 degrees. How does this angle relate to the arcs? Let me recall. If angle ABC is an inscribed angle, then its measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc. But where is point B located? If B is on the circumference, then angle ABC would intercept an arc. Alternatively, if B is outside the circle, then the angle could be formed by two secants, and the measure would be half the difference of the intercepted arcs.

Wait, the problem mentions angle ABC. Let me consider different possibilities. Suppose points A, B, C are on the circle. Then angle ABC would be an inscribed angle intercepting arc AC. But then the measure of angle ABC would be half of arc AC, which is x. But according to the problem, angle ABC is 70 degrees. That would mean x = 140. But 140 isn't one of the options. Hmm, maybe my assumption about the location of B is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe B is outside the circle. In that case, angle ABC would be formed by two secants intersecting at B. The formula for the measure of an angle formed by two secants outside the circle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. So, if angle ABC is formed by secants BA and BC, then the measure would be (arc AC - arc ADC)/2. Wait, but arc ADC is the major arc, which is y. But arc AC is the minor arc x. Wait, but if the angle is formed outside, then the measure is (larger arc - smaller arc)/2. So, angle ABC = (y - x)/2. Given that angle ABC is 70 degrees, then (y - x)/2 = 70 => y - x = 140. 

But we also know that x + y = 360 degrees because they are the measures of the two arcs that make up the whole circle. So, we have two equations:

1. x + y = 360
2. y - x = 140

Adding these equations together: 2y = 500 => y = 250. Then substituting back, x = 360 - 250 = 110. So x would be 110 degrees. Which is option C. 

Wait, but let me check again. Is angle ABC formed by two secants? For that, point B has to be outside the circle. So, if B is outside, then yes, the angle would be half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs would be the major arc ADC and the minor arc AC. Therefore, angle ABC = (major arc ADC - minor arc AC)/2. Hence, 70 = (y - x)/2 → y - x = 140. And since x + y = 360, solving gives x = 110. 

So the answer should be C. Let me confirm once more. If x is 110, then y is 250. The difference is 140, half of that is 70, which matches the given angle. Yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is C.
