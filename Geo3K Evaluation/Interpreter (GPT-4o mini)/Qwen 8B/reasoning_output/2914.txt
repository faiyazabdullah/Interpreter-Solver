MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we need to find the area of a parallelogram given some specific conditions. Let me start by recalling the properties of a parallelogram. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in length, and opposite angles are equal. Also, the area can be calculated as base times height, but since we have some right angles mentioned here, maybe there's another way involving right triangles?

Looking at the given predicates: 

First, Parallelogram(A,B,C,D). That means AB is parallel to CD, AD is parallel to BC, and the opposite sides are equal. But I need more info about the sides or angles. 

Then there are these length equalities: Length of BE is 22, CE is 24, BC is 26. And Angle at E (angle CEB) is a right angle. Wait, the right angle is at point E? The predicate says RightAngle(Angle(C,E,B)), so that would mean angle at E between points C, E, B is 90 degrees. So triangle CEB is a right triangle with legs 24 and 22, and hypotenuse CB? Wait, because CE is 24, BE is 22, so CB should be the hypotenuse. Let me check that with Pythagoras. 24 squared plus 22 squared equals 576 + 484 = 1060. Then sqrt(1060) ≈ 32.56... But wait, the given length of BC is 26. Hmm, that doesn't match. There's a contradiction here. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the configuration.

Wait, the problem states that Parallelogram(A,B,C,D), so points A, B, C, D form a parallelogram. Let me try to visualize this. Let's assume the order of the letters matters. In a parallelogram ABCD, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So AB is adjacent to BC. Now, points E are involved. The segments BE and CE are given. So E is some point connected to B and C. Since angle at E (C-E-B) is a right angle, so E is forming a right angle with C and B. 

So perhaps E is inside the parallelogram? Or outside? Let me think. Let me sketch mentally. Suppose ABCD is a parallelogram. Let me consider coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates could help. Let me place point B at the origin for simplicity. Let me set coordinate system with B at (0,0). Since angle CEB is right, and BE=22, CE=24. So if I consider E somewhere such that BE is horizontal or vertical? Wait, since it's a right angle at E, then vectors EB and EC are perpendicular. So if I assign coordinates, let me suppose E has coordinates (x,y). Then vector EB would be from E to B, which is (0 - x, 0 - y) = (-x, -y). Vector EC is from E to C, which would be (Cx - x, Cy - y). These two vectors need to be perpendicular, so their dot product is zero. 

But maybe instead of getting bogged down in variables, I can use the Pythagorean theorem. Since triangle CEB is right-angled at E, then CE² + BE² = CB². Wait, but according to the given data, CE is 24, BE is 22, so 24² + 22² = 576 + 484 = 1060. Then CB should be sqrt(1060) ≈ 32.56. However, the problem states that LengthOf(Line(B,C)) is 26. This is conflicting. Therefore, my assumption must be wrong. 

Wait, maybe the right angle isn't part of triangle CEB? Or perhaps E is not connected directly to C and B? Wait, the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(C,E,B)), so the angle at E between C and B. So yes, triangle CEB with right angle at E. So according to Pythagoras, CB should be sqrt(CE² + BE²). But given CE=24, BE=22, that gives CB≈sqrt(1060)=~32.56, but the problem says CB=26. Contradiction. Therefore, there's something wrong here. 

Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. 

Given:

Parallelogram(A,B,C,D)

Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,E)),22)

Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,E)),24)

Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)),26)

RightAngle(Angle(C,E,B))

Ah! Wait, Line(B,E) is BE, which is 22 units. Line(C,E) is CE, 24 units. Line(B,C) is BC, which is 26 units. But in triangle CEB, right-angled at E, then by Pythagoras, BE² + CE² = BC². But substituting numbers, 22² + 24² = 484 + 576 = 1060. BC² is 26² = 676. Which is not equal. So this suggests inconsistency. How come?

This implies that either the problem has a typo, or I misunderstood the configuration. Alternatively, maybe the triangle isn't CEB but another triangle? Or perhaps E is not connected to both B and C? Wait, the angle is at E between C, E, B. So the triangle is C-E-B, so yes, CEB. 

Alternatively, maybe the right angle is not between BE and CE, but something else? No, the angle at E between C and B is right. So that's angle CEB being right. 

Hmm, this seems contradictory. Unless the triangle isn't right-angled. But the problem says it is. So how do we resolve this? Maybe the given lengths aren't for triangle CEB, but other triangles? Or perhaps E is not a point inside the parallelogram but outside? Let me think. For example, if E is outside the parallelogram, then maybe the triangle isn't formed with BE and CE as legs. Wait, but even if E is outside, the triangle CEB would still require BE and CE as legs. 

Wait, unless the right angle is not part of triangle CEB, but another triangle? Wait, the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(C,E,B)). That angle is at E, so vertex at E, with segments EC and EB. So yes, triangle CEB. 

This seems like a contradiction. Therefore, maybe the problem assumes that BC is not the hypotenuse? But how? Because in a right triangle, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. So if the right angle is at E, then BC would be the hypotenuse. Hence, BC² should equal BE² + CE². But according to the given values, that's not true. 

Wait, maybe the problem uses different labels? Like, maybe the right angle is at B or C? But the predicate says Angle(C,E,B), so the middle letter is E, so the angle is at E. 

Is there a possibility that the given lengths are not the legs but one leg and the hypotenuse? For instance, if BE is one leg, and BC is the hypotenuse, then CE would be the other leg. Let's test that. If BE=22, BC=26, then CE would be sqrt(BC² - BE²) = sqrt(676 - 484) = sqrt(192) ≈ 13.85. But the given CE is 24, which doesn't match. Similarly, if CE is a leg and BC is hypotenuse, then BE would be sqrt(BC² - CE²) = sqrt(676 - 576) = sqrt(100) = 10, but given BE is 22. Not matching. 

So there's definitely a contradiction here. Unless there's a miscalculation. Wait, let me recalculate. 

BE is 22, CE is 24. Their squares are 484 and 576. Sum is 484+576=1060. BC is 26, square is 676. 1060≠676. So this is impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my understanding. 

Wait, maybe the right angle is not between BE and CE, but between another pair of segments? For example, maybe the angle is at E between BE and something else? But the predicate specifies Angle(C,E,B), which is angle at E between C and B. So that would be angle between EC and EB. 

Alternatively, could there be a miscalculation in the problem statement? For example, if BC was supposed to be longer? Or maybe the lengths of BE and CE are swapped? Let me see. Suppose BE is 24, CE is 22. Then sum of squares would be 576 + 484 = 1060, same as before. Still doesn't match BC=26. 

Alternatively, maybe the right angle is not at E, but at another point? Wait, the predicate says Angle(C,E,B), which is angle at E. 

This suggests that the problem as stated contains inconsistent data. But since it's a problem given to solve, there must be a way. Perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the figure. Let me think again. 

Maybe the parallelogram is not convex? Or E is not inside the parallelogram? Let me consider that. Suppose E is outside the parallelogram. Let me imagine the parallelogram ABCD, with points B and C connected. Point E is outside such that BE=22, CE=24, and angle CEB is right. Then BC would be the distance between B and C, which is given as 26. But in this case, triangle CEB would have sides BE=22, CE=24, and BC=26. But according to the Pythagorean theorem, 22² + 24² should equal 26². But 22² +24² = 484 + 576 = 1060, while 26² is 676. Not equal. So even if E is outside, this doesn't hold. 

Wait, unless the triangle is not right-angled at E? But the problem states it is. 

Alternatively, maybe the given lengths are not the lengths of BE and CE, but something else? Wait, the predicates say Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,E)),22), so that's BE=22. Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,E)),24) is CE=24. So those are correct. 

Hmm. Maybe the problem involves three-dimensional geometry? But the question asks for area of a parallelogram, which is planar. 

Wait, maybe the right angle is not in the plane of the parallelogram? Unlikely, as all points are presumably coplanar. 

Alternatively, perhaps the parallelogram is degenerate? But then BC would be equal to BE or CE. 

I'm stuck. Maybe I need to proceed differently. Let's forget the right triangle for a moment and focus on the parallelogram. The area of a parallelogram is base × height. If I can find the base and the corresponding height. 

But how does the right angle and the lengths relate to the parallelogram? Let's think. Since ABCD is a parallelogram, BC is one side, which is given as 26. So BC is a side of the parallelogram. If I can find the height relative to this base, then multiply by 26 to get the area. 

But how to find the height? The presence of point E and the right angle might be crucial. Let me think. Since angle CEB is right, and BE=22, CE=24. Maybe E is a point such that when connected to B and C, forms a right triangle. But earlier calculation shows inconsistency. 

Wait, maybe the triangle CEB is not right-angled at E, but the problem says it is. 

Alternatively, maybe the right angle is part of another triangle. For example, if AE is perpendicular to something? Wait, the problem mentions point E, but not sure where. 

Let me try to think of coordinates again. Let me assign coordinates to make equations work. Let me place point B at (0,0). Let me assume that since angle CEB is right, and BE=22, CE=24, and BC=26. Let me denote coordinates for E as (x,y), B at (0,0), and C at (a,b). Then, the distance from B to E is sqrt(x² + y²) = 22 → x² + y² = 484. Distance from C to E is sqrt((a-x)^2 + (b-y)^2) = 24 → (a-x)^2 + (b-y)^2 = 576. Distance from B to C is sqrt(a² + b²) = 26 → a² + b² = 676. 

Also, since angle at E is right, vectors EB and EC are perpendicular. Vector EB is from E to B: (0 - x, 0 - y) = (-x, -y). Vector EC is from E to C: (a - x, b - y). Their dot product should be zero: (-x)(a - x) + (-y)(b - y) = 0 → -ax + x² - by + y² = 0 → x² + y² = ax + by. 

From earlier, x² + y² = 484, so 484 = ax + by. 

Now, also, a² + b² = 676. 

We have two equations: 
1. ax + by = 484 
2. a² + b² = 676 

But we also have from CE's equation: (a - x)^2 + (b - y)^2 = 576. Expand this: a² - 2ax + x² + b² - 2by + y² = 576. Substitute x² + y² = 484 and a² + b² = 676: 

676 - 2(ax + by) + 484 = 576 → 676 + 484 - 2*484 = 576 → (1160) - 968 = 576 → 192 = 576? No, that's impossible. 

Wait, this leads to 192 = 576, which is false. Therefore, there's no solution under these constraints. This confirms the inconsistency. 

But the problem exists, so I must be missing something. Maybe the right angle is not in the triangle CEB, but in another triangle? Or perhaps E is not connected to both B and C? Wait, the angle is at E between C and B, so it must involve both. 

Alternatively, maybe the parallelogram is not in the same plane as the right angle? No, that wouldn't make sense. 

Wait, perhaps the given lengths are not for the entire segment, but parts of it? For example, BE is part of BC? But BC is 26, and BE is 22. If E were on BC extended, then BE would be part of BC. Let me explore this. 

Suppose E lies on the extension of BC beyond C. Then BE would be BC + CE. But BC is 26, CE is 24, so BE would be 26 + 24 = 50. But given BE is 22, which contradicts. Alternatively, if E is between B and C, then BE + EC = BC. So BE + EC = 22 + 24 = 46 ≠ 26. Doesn't fit. 

Another idea: Maybe E is not on BC, but somewhere else. For example, E is connected to B and C, forming a right angle at E, but not lying on BC. But then the previous equations show inconsistency. 

Wait, maybe the problem meant that the parallelogram has a right angle at E? No, the parallelogram's angles are determined by its sides. Unless it's a rectangle, but then all angles are right, but the given angle is at E, which may not be a corner of the parallelogram. 

Alternatively, maybe E is one of the vertices of the parallelogram? For example, maybe E is point D? But the parallelogram is named A,B,C,D, so E is a separate point. 

Wait, the problem states Parallelogram(A,B,C,D). So points A,B,C,D are the four vertices. E is another point. 

At this point, I'm stuck due to the inconsistency in the given lengths. However, since this is a problem presented to solve, I must assume that there's a way around it. Perhaps the right angle is not between BE and CE, but between another pair of lines. Wait, the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(C,E,B)), which is angle at E between C and B. So it's angle CEB. 

Wait, could there be a miscalculation in my earlier steps? Let me recheck. 

Given BE=22, CE=24, angle at E is right. So triangle CEB has legs 22 and 24, hypotenuse sqrt(22² + 24²) = sqrt(484 + 576) = sqrt(1060) ≈ 32.56. But BC is given as 26. So this suggests that BC is not the hypotenuse. Hence, my initial assumption that BC is the hypotenuse is wrong. 

Wait, maybe BC is one of the legs? Let me think. If angle at E is right, then BC could be one leg or the other. For example, if BE is one leg, BC is another leg, and CE is hypotenuse. Let's test that. 

If BE=22, BC=26, then CE would be sqrt(22² + 26²) = sqrt(484 + 676) = sqrt(1160) ≈ 34.06, but given CE is 24. No. Alternatively, if CE=24 is one leg, BC=26 is another leg, then BE would be sqrt(24² + 26²) = sqrt(576 + 676) = sqrt(1252) ≈ 35.38, but given BE is 22. No. 

Alternatively, if BC is the hypotenuse, then as before, it should be sqrt(22² + 24²) ≈ 32.56, but given BC is 26. 

This suggests that the given data is inconsistent. But since the problem is given, there must be a resolution. Perhaps the right angle is not in triangle CEB, but in another triangle involving E and the parallelogram? For example, if E is a point such that AE is perpendicular to something? 

Wait, maybe the parallelogram has a right angle at one of its corners, and E is related to that? For instance, if the parallelogram is a rectangle, then all angles are right, but the given angle at E is right. But without knowing where E is, it's hard to tell. 

Alternatively, maybe E is the intersection of diagonals? In a parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other. But if E is the midpoint of diagonal AC, then BE and CE would be parts of the diagonals. Let me explore this. 

In a parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other. So if E is the midpoint of diagonal AC, then BE and CE would be segments from B to E and C to E. But the length of BE and CE would depend on the shape of the parallelogram. Let me see. 

Let me denote the diagonals as AC and BD intersecting at E. In that case, E is the midpoint of both diagonals. So BE would be half of diagonal BD, and CE would be half of diagonal AC. But the given lengths are BE=22 and CE=24. So if E is the midpoint of the diagonals, then BD=44 and AC=48. But in a parallelogram, the diagonals satisfy the relation that they bisect each other, but their lengths are related to the sides. However, the relationship between the diagonals and the sides depends on the type of parallelogram. For example, in a rhombus, diagonals are perpendicular, but in general parallelograms, they are not. 

However, the problem states that angle CEB is a right angle. If E is the intersection of the diagonals, then angle CEB would be the angle between diagonals AC and BD at E. In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a rhombus or a square. 

So if angle CEB is right, then the diagonals are perpendicular, making it a rhombus. But in a rhombus, all sides are equal. However, the given BC is 26, so all sides are 26. But then the lengths of BE and CE would be halves of the diagonals. Let me calculate. 

In a rhombus with side length 26, diagonals d1 and d2 satisfy (d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2 = side^2. So (d1² + d2²)/4 = 26² → d1² + d2² = 4*676 = 2704. 

But in this scenario, BE and CE are halves of the diagonals. If BE=22 and CE=24, then d1=44 and d2=48. Then d1² + d2² = 44² + 48² = 1936 + 2304 = 4240, which is much larger than 2704. So this doesn't fit. 

Thus, this approach also doesn't resolve the inconsistency. 

Wait, maybe E is not the intersection of diagonals, but another point. Let me think. Suppose E is a point such that BE=22, CE=24, angle at E is right, and BC=26. Even though the Pythagorean theorem doesn't hold, maybe there's a different configuration. 

For example, if the triangle CEB is not right-angled, but the given condition says it is. This is confusing. 

Perhaps the problem uses vectors or coordinate geometry where the distances don't follow Pythagoras? No, that's impossible. 

Wait, maybe the right angle is not in the plane of the parallelogram? But that would be non-Euclidean geometry, which is unlikely. 

Alternatively, maybe the lengths are not Euclidean? No, standard geometry applies. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent without resolving the inconsistency, I'll try to look for another approach. Let me recall that in a parallelogram, the area can also be found using the magnitude of cross product of adjacent sides. If I can find the lengths of the sides and the sine of one of the angles. 

But we know BC is 26. Let me call BC = 26. Let me call AB as another side. If I can find the height corresponding to base BC, then area is base × height. 

Alternatively, if I can find the angle between sides AB and BC, then area is AB × BC × sin(theta). 

But how to find theta? 

Wait, the presence of point E and the right angle might provide a way to find this angle. 

Let me think: If I can express the coordinates of E in terms of the parallelogram's coordinates, maybe I can derive relations. 

Assume parallelogram ABCD with AB and DC parallel, AD and BC parallel. Let me assign coordinates: Let me place point B at (0,0), point C at (26,0) since BC=26. Let me assume that the parallelogram is positioned such that BC is along x-axis. Now, point A is somewhere, and D is determined by the parallelogram property. 

Now, point E is such that BE=22, CE=24, and angle CEB is right. Let me find coordinates of E. 

Let me denote coordinates: B=(0,0), C=(26,0). Let E=(x,y). Then BE=22: distance from B to E is sqrt(x² + y²) = 22 → x² + y² = 484. CE=24: distance from C to E is sqrt((x-26)^2 + y²) = 24 → (x-26)^2 + y² = 576. 

Subtracting first equation from second: (x-26)^2 + y² - x² - y² = 576 - 484 → x² -52x + 676 - x² = 92 → -52x + 676 = 92 → -52x = 92 - 676 = -584 → x = (-584)/(-52) = 584/52 = simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 4: 146/13 ≈ 11.23. 

Now, x=146/13. Let me compute that: 13*11=143, so 146-143=3 → x=11 + 3/13 ≈ 11.23. 

Now, substitute x back into x² + y² = 484 to find y. 

x = 146/13. Compute x²: (146)^2 / 169. 146^2 = (150-4)^2 = 22500 - 1200 + 16 = 21316. So x² = 21316/169. 

Thus, y² = 484 - x² = 484 - 21316/169. Convert 484 to over 169: 484 = 484 * 169/169. Let me compute 484 * 169. Well, this is going to be messy, but let me try. 

Alternatively, note that 484 = 22², and 21316/169 = (146/13)^2. 

But regardless, let's compute y² = 484 - (146/13)^2. 

But we also know that angle at E is right, so vectors EB and EC are perpendicular. Let's verify that. 

Vector EB is from E to B: B - E = (0 - x, 0 - y) = (-x, -y).

Vector EC is from E to C: C - E = (26 - x, 0 - y) = (26 - x, -y).

Their dot product should be zero: (-x)(26 - x) + (-y)(-y) = -26x + x² + y² = 0. 

But from x² + y² = 484, substitute: -26x + 484 = 0 → 26x = 484 → x = 484/26 = 22. 

Wait, but earlier we found x = 146/13 ≈ 11.23. But according to this, x=22. This is a contradiction. 

This means our assumption that angle at E is right leads to x=22, but from the distance equations, x=146/13 ≈ 11.23. Thus, inconsistency. 

Therefore, there's no such point E that satisfies both the distances and the right angle. This suggests the problem has inconsistent data. But since it's a problem, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the placement of points? 

Wait, let me check the calculation for x. From the equations:

From BE and CE distances, we had:

(x-26)^2 + y² = 576  
x² + y² = 484  

Subtract: (x-26)^2 - x² = 92  
Expand: x² -52x + 676 - x² = -52x + 676 = 92  
→ -52x = 92 - 676 = -584 → x = 584/52 = 146/13 ≈ 11.23. Correct. 

And from the right angle condition: -26x + x² + y² = 0. Since x² + y² = 484, this becomes -26x + 484 = 0 → x = 484/26 = 22. 

But x cannot be both 146/13 ≈ 11.23 and 22. This contradiction implies no solution exists, which is impossible for a problem. 

Therefore, I must conclude that there's a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps I've misread it. Let me double-check the original problem. 

Original problem says: 

- Parallelogram(A,B,C,D)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,E)),22)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,E)),24)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)),26)
- RightAngle(Angle(C,E,B))

Wait, could there be a typo in the length of BC? If BC were 32.56 instead of 26, then everything fits. But given it's 26, there's no solution. 

Alternatively, maybe the right angle is at B or C? Let me try assuming the right angle is at B. So Angle at B, between C, B, E. That would mean angle CBE is right. Then, in triangle CBE, right-angled at B. Then BE and BC are legs, CE is hypotenuse. So BE=22, BC=26, then CE=sqrt(22² + 26²) = sqrt(484 + 676) = sqrt(1160) ≈ 34.06, but given CE is 24. Not matching. 

If the right angle is at C, then angle BCE is right. Then BC and CE are legs, BE is hypotenuse. So BC=26, CE=24, then BE=sqrt(26² + 24²) = sqrt(676 + 576) = sqrt(1252) ≈ 35.38, but given BE is 22. No. 

Alternatively, if the right angle is at E, but the given BC is not the hypotenuse. But how? 

Wait, maybe the triangle is not CEB but another triangle. For example, if the right angle is at E, and BE is one leg, and BC is the other leg, making CE the hypotenuse. Wait, but then BE and BC would be legs. Let me try: BE=22, BC=26, then CE=sqrt(22² + 26²) ≈ 34.06, but given CE is 24. No. 

This suggests that the problem is flawed. However, since it's a multiple-choice question, perhaps the intended answer is to ignore the inconsistency and proceed with some method. 

Alternatively, perhaps the right angle is not part of the triangle CEB, but the parallelogram has a right angle at one of its corners, and E is related to that. For example, if angle at B is right, then ABCD is a rectangle. But then BC would be equal to AD, and AB equal to CD. But without more info, it's hard to proceed. 

Alternatively, maybe the area can be found using the lengths BE and CE, assuming they form a right triangle, even though BC doesn't fit. Let me try calculating the area of triangle CEB as (22*24)/2 = 264. But how does this relate to the parallelogram? 

If the parallelogram has a height related to this triangle, but I don't see the connection. 

Wait, perhaps the area of the parallelogram is twice the area of triangle CEB? If the parallelogram is made up of two such triangles? But without knowing the relationship between E and the parallelogram, this is speculative. 

Alternatively, if the parallelogram's sides are BE and CE, but BE=22 and CE=24, then area would be 22*24 = 528, which is option B. But why would the parallelogram's area be BE*CE? That would be true if BE and CE are adjacent sides, but in this case, BE and CE are not sides of the parallelogram. 

But given that the options include 528, which is 22*24, and the problem might expect this despite the inconsistency, perhaps the intended answer is B. 

Alternatively, maybe the area of the parallelogram is the same as the area of the right triangle multiplied by 2, giving 264*2=528. This would be the case if the parallelogram is formed by translating the triangle CEB. But this is pure speculation. 

Since the options include 528 as option B, and given the lack of other viable paths, I'll go with B as the answer.
