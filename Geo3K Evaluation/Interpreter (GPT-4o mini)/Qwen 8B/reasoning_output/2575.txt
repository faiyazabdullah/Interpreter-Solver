Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out what's going on here. 

So, we have points R, S, T, Q, A, and maybe others. There are chords RS and QT. Then there's an intersection point A where lines RQ and ST intersect at point A. Also, some angle measures are given in terms of x. The question is asking for the measure of angle S, which I assume is ∠RST or something like that. Let me try to visualize this.

First, the diagram probably involves two chords intersecting inside a circle because of the IntersectAt predicate involving lines RQ and ST meeting at A. Wait, the IntersectAt mentions Line(R,Q) and Line(S,T) intersecting at Point A. So, lines RQ and ST intersect at A. Also, there are chords RS and QT. So maybe points R, S, T, Q lie on a circle? Because chords are mentioned. 

Let me recall that when two chords intersect inside a circle, there's a theorem about the products of the segments being equal. But also, there's the vertical angles formed and the relationship between the angles created by intersecting chords. Wait, but here they mention angles with measures given in terms of x. 

Looking at the angles given: MeasureOf(Angle(R,S,T)) equals 5x + 4. That would be angle at S between points R, S, T. Similarly, MeasureOf(Angle(Q,T,S)) is 6x - 2, which is angle at T between Q, T, S. And MeasureOf(Angle(Q,R,S)) is 32 degrees. So angle at R between Q, R, S is 32 degrees. 

Wait, so maybe triangle QRS is involved here? Or perhaps triangle RST? Let me think. Since points R, S, T, Q are connected via chords and intersecting lines. 

But since there's an intersection at point A of lines RQ and ST, that suggests that A is inside the circle where these chords cross. Therefore, applying the intersecting chords angle theorem. When two chords intersect, the measure of the angle formed is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. Alternatively, the vertical angles formed are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary. 

Alternatively, maybe using triangle angle sums. Let me consider the angles around point A. Let me try to sketch mentally. Lines RQ and ST intersect at A. So, point A is inside the circle, with RQ and ST crossing there. 

Then, considering the angles formed at A. For example, angle RAQ and angle TSA would be vertical angles? Wait, no. Let me clarify. When two lines intersect, vertical angles are opposite each other. So if lines RQ and ST intersect at A, then angles at A would be: ∠RAQ and ∠STA are vertical angles? Wait, no. Let me label properly. 

Suppose line RQ crosses line ST at A. So, the four angles at A are: 
- Between R-A-S (but wait, line RQ goes from R to Q, passing through A; line ST goes from S to T, passing through A. So, the intersection creates four angles. For instance, one angle is between R-A-S, another between S-A-Q, another between Q-A-T, and another between T-A-R. Wait, maybe I should think of it as two lines crossing, creating vertical angles. 

But how does this relate to the given angles? The given angles are ∠RST, ∠QTS, and ∠QRS. Let me note down:

Given:
∠RST = 5x + 4°
∠QTS = 6x - 2°
∠QRS = 32°

We need to find m∠S, which could be ∠RST or another angle. Wait, the problem says "Find m∠S". Depending on the configuration, ∠S could refer to ∠RST (which is given as 5x + 4) or maybe another angle at point S. But since ∠RST is already given in terms of x, maybe there's another angle at S that needs to be found. Wait, perhaps the problem refers to ∠QSR or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe ∠S is referring to ∠QSR, which is part of triangle QSR. Let me think again. 

Since points R, S, T, Q are on a circle, and chords RS and QT. Also, lines RQ and ST intersect at A. So, A is inside the circle. Now, using the intersecting chords theorem, which states that the measure of an angle formed by two chords intersecting at a point inside the circle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. 

For example, ∠RAS would be half the sum of arc RS and arc QT. Wait, but I need to check which arcs correspond to which angles. 

But first, let's look at the angles given. For instance, ∠RST is an angle at point S, formed by points R, S, T. Since S is on the circle, and T is also on the circle, so ∠RST is an inscribed angle intercepting arc RT. Similarly, ∠QTS is an inscribed angle intercepting arc QS. 

Wait, but maybe I should use the fact that when two chords intersect, the measure of the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. However, in this case, the angles given are not necessarily those formed by intersecting chords but rather angles of triangles. 

Alternatively, considering triangle RST and triangle QTS. Let me see. 

Given that ∠QRS is 32°, which is at point R between Q, R, S. So that's an angle in triangle QRS. 

Also, since lines RQ and ST intersect at A, maybe we can consider triangle ARS or something. 

Alternatively, using the vertical angles formed at A. Suppose that ∠QAR is equal to ∠STA, and ∠QAS is equal to ∠RTA. Wait, but without knowing which angles are which, it's hard to proceed. 

Alternatively, since we have angles in terms of x, maybe set up equations based on the triangle angle sum. 

Let me consider triangle RST. In triangle RST, the angles are ∠RST (given as 5x + 4), ∠SRT (which might be related to other parts), and ∠RTS. Wait, but I don't know if that helps directly. 

Alternatively, looking at triangle QRS. We know ∠QRS is 32°, and maybe other angles in that triangle. But how do we connect them?

Wait, maybe using the intersecting chords' angle formula. The angle formed by two chords intersecting inside a circle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. So, for example, if we take the angle at A between RQ and ST, say ∠QAS, that would be half the sum of arcs SQ and RT. But I'm not sure yet. 

Alternatively, maybe considering the angles given (∠RST, ∠QTS, ∠QRS) and relating them through the circle's properties. 

Another thought: since points R, S, T, Q are on a circle, the angles ∠RST and ∠QTS are inscribed angles. So ∠RST intercepts arc RT, and ∠QTS intercepts arc QS. 

But how does that help us? Maybe combining with the intersecting chords at A. 

Alternatively, since lines RQ and ST intersect at A, then according to the intersecting chords theorem, the product of the segments of one chord equals the product of the segments of the other chord. But that relates to lengths, not angles. 

Hmm. Let me think again. The angles given are in terms of x, and we need to find m∠S. Let's denote variables for the angles and set up equations. 

Given:

MeasureOf(Angle(R,S,T)) = 5x + 4 → ∠RST = 5x + 4°

MeasureOf(Angle(Q,T,S)) = 6x - 2 → ∠QTS = 6x - 2°

MeasureOf(Angle(Q,R,S)) = 32 → ∠QRS = 32°

Need to find m∠S. Assuming ∠S refers to ∠RST or another angle. Wait, maybe ∠QSR? Let me check. 

In triangle QRS, we have ∠QRS = 32°, and if we can find other angles in that triangle, maybe we can relate them. 

But how do we connect this with the other angles? Perhaps considering that points Q, R, S, T are on a circle, making QRST a cyclic quadrilateral? Wait, but for that, the sum of opposite angles would be 180°, but I'm not sure if QRST is cyclic. 

Wait, the chords RS and QT exist, implying that R, S, T, Q are on the same circle. So yes, QRST is a cyclic quadrilateral. Therefore, opposite angles in the quadrilateral would sum to 180°. 

But in that case, ∠QRS + ∠QTS = 180°, since they are opposite angles. Wait, ∠QRS is at R, and ∠QTS is at T. Are these opposite angles in the cyclic quadrilateral? Let me confirm. 

In cyclic quadrilaterals, opposite angles are supplementary. So if QRST is cyclic, then ∠QRS + ∠QTS = 180°, and ∠RST + ∠QTR = 180°. 

Wait, but ∠QTS is given as 6x - 2, and ∠QRS is 32°. So according to cyclic quadrilateral property:

∠QRS + ∠QTS = 180°  
→ 32 + (6x - 2) = 180  
→ 6x + 30 = 180  
→ 6x = 150  
→ x = 25  

If that's the case, then x is 25. Let's check if that works. 

Then, substituting back into the expressions:

∠RST = 5x + 4 = 5*25 + 4 = 125 + 4 = 129°  
∠QTS = 6x - 2 = 6*25 - 2 = 150 - 2 = 148°  
Adding them gives 129 + 148 = 277, which doesn't equal 180. Wait, that contradicts the earlier conclusion. So my assumption that QRST is a cyclic quadrilateral may be wrong. 

Wait why did I think that? Because there are chords RS and QT, but does that mean all four points are on the circle? Not necessarily unless the chords are part of the same circle. Wait, the problem says Chord(R,S) and Chord(Q,T). So R, S are endpoints of one chord, Q, T are endpoints of another. But unless they're all on the same circle, which isn't stated. Wait, the problem starts with Circle(C), so maybe all points are on circle C. 

Assuming all points R, S, T, Q are on circle C. Then QRST is indeed a cyclic quadrilateral. Therefore, the previous calculation should hold. But according to that, adding ∠QRS + ∠QTS = 180° leads to x=25, but then substituting back into ∠RST and ∠QTS gives angles that don't add up. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate. 

Wait, if QRST is cyclic, then ∠QRS and ∠QTS are not necessarily opposite angles. Let me get the order of the quadrilateral. Points Q, R, S, T arranged on the circle. If the quadrilateral is QRST, then the order matters. 

Assuming the quadrilateral is Q-R-S-T connected in order, then opposite angles would be ∠Q and ∠S, ∠R and ∠T. But the given angles are ∠QRS (at R) and ∠QTS (at T). So those would be adjacent angles, not opposite. Hence, my previous assumption was incorrect. Therefore, QRST is cyclic, but ∠QRS and ∠QTS are not opposite angles. 

Therefore, the cyclic quadrilateral property might not directly apply here. So that approach may not work. 

Alternative plan: Let's consider the intersecting chords at point A. The measure of an angle formed by two intersecting chords is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. 

So, for example, ∠QAS (the angle at A between QA and SA) would be half the sum of arcs QS and RT. But I need to identify which arcs are intercepted by the angles given. 

However, the given angles are ∠RST, ∠QTS, and ∠QRS. These are angles of triangles, not angles at the intersection point A. 

Alternatively, maybe using triangle angle sums. Let's consider triangles involving the given angles. 

Starting with triangle QRS. We know ∠QRS = 32°. Let's suppose we can find other angles in this triangle. For example, if we can find ∠QSR or ∠SQR, then we can use the triangle sum. 

But how do we relate these angles to the rest of the diagram? 

Perhaps focusing on triangle RST. In triangle RST, we have ∠RST = 5x + 4, and if we can find other angles, maybe we can relate them. 

Alternatively, since lines RQ and ST intersect at A, forming vertical angles. Let's consider triangle AQS and triangle AST. 

Alternatively, think about the angles around point A. For example, ∠QAS and ∠SAR are vertical angles. Also, the sum of angles around point A is 360°. 

But without knowing specific angles, this seems vague. 

Wait, maybe using the fact that angles subtended by the same arc are equal. 

Another idea: Since ∠RST and ∠QTS are inscribed angles, they intercept arcs. 

∠RST is an inscribed angle intercepting arc RT. Therefore, its measure is half the arc RT. Similarly, ∠QTS intercepts arc QS, so its measure is half arc QS. 

Similarly, ∠QRS is an inscribed angle intercepting arc QS. Wait, ∠QRS is at point R, so it intercepts arc QS. Wait, no. Inscribed angle at R intercepting arc QS would require that the angle is formed by points Q, R, S. Yes, that's correct. So ∠QRS intercepts arc QS. 

Therefore, ∠QRS = ½ arc QS. 

Similarly, ∠QTS intercepts arc QS (since it's at T, connecting Q, T, S). Wait, no. ∠QTS is at point T, so it intercepts arc QS. Wait, but ∠QTS is formed by points Q, T, S. So the intercepted arc would be arc QS that does not contain T. 

But since all points are on the circle, arc QS can be considered. 

So, if ∠QRS = ½ arc QS, and ∠QTS = ½ arc QS, then ∠QRS = ∠QTS. But according to the given, ∠QRS is 32°, and ∠QTS is 6x - 2. Setting them equal: 32 = 6x - 2 → 6x = 34 → x = 34/6 ≈ 5.666..., which doesn't seem promising. But this would imply that arc QS is 64°, leading to ∠QTS = 32°, but the given ∠QTS is 6x - 2. This suggests inconsistency. Therefore, my assumption that both angles intercept the same arc is wrong. 

Wait, why did I think ∠QTS intercepts arc QS? Let me re-examine. 

An inscribed angle at point T intercepting arc QS would be formed by points Q, T, S. Wait, the angle at T between Q and S would intercept arc Q to S that doesn't pass through T. So yes, arc QS. Whereas ∠QRS is at point R, intercepting arc QS as well. Therefore, both angles ∠QRS and ∠QTS intercept arc QS, hence they should be equal. But according to the problem, ∠QRS is 32°, while ∠QTS is 6x - 2. Therefore, setting 32 = 6x - 2 → 6x = 34 → x = 34/6 ≈ 5.666... But then, substituting x into ∠RST = 5x + 4 would give 5*(34/6) +4 = (170/6)+4 ≈ 28.33 +4 = 32.33°, which seems arbitrary. 

This suggests that either my understanding is wrong, or there's more to the diagram. 

Wait, maybe ∠QTS intercepts a different arc. For instance, if the angle at T is formed by points Q, T, S, then it could intercept arc Q to S that passes through R instead of the other way. But depending on the position of the points, the intercepted arc could vary. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle ∠QTS intercepts arc QR instead of QS. No, that wouldn't make sense. 

Alternatively, perhaps the diagram has overlapping arcs. Maybe I need to consider the entire circle and the arcs between the points. 

Alternatively, since lines RQ and ST intersect at A, and we have angles formed there. Let's consider the vertical angles at A. For instance, ∠QAS and ∠RAT are vertical angles. Each of these angles is equal to half the sum of the intercepted arcs. 

For example, ∠QAS would be ½(arc QS + arc RT). Similarly, ∠RAT would be ½(arc QS + arc RT). 

But how does this relate to the given angles? 

Alternatively, looking at triangle RST and triangle QTS. Let me think about the angles in those triangles. 

In triangle RST, angles are ∠RST = 5x + 4, ∠SRT, and ∠RTS. 

In triangle QTS, angles are ∠QTS = 6x - 2, ∠TQS, and ∠QTS. Wait, not sure. 

Alternatively, using the fact that the sum of angles in triangle RST is 180°. If I can express other angles in terms of x, maybe I can find a relation. 

But without knowing other angles, this might not be straightforward. 

Wait, but we also have ∠QRS = 32°, which is an angle in triangle QRS. Let me consider triangle QRS. It has angles at Q, R, S. We know ∠QRS = 32°, and if we can find other angles in this triangle, maybe we can link them to other parts. 

But how? Perhaps by considering that points Q, R, S, T are on a circle, so certain angles are related. 

Wait, since points Q, R, S, T are on a circle, then ∠QSR is equal to ∠QTR because they subtend the same arc QR. Wait, not sure. 

Alternatively, since ∠QRS is an inscribed angle intercepting arc QS, as before. And ∠QTS intercepts arc QS as well, so they should be equal. Which led to the contradiction earlier. 

But since that led to inconsistency, maybe there's an error in assuming that both angles intercept the same arc. 

Wait, maybe ∠QTS intercepts arc QR instead? Let me think. If ∠QTS is at point T, then it's formed by points Q, T, S. So the angle at T intercepts arc QS that doesn't contain T. But if the points are arranged such that arc QS is split into two parts by T, then maybe ∠QTS intercepts the arc Q to S that doesn't go through T. 

Alternatively, maybe the arcs are different. 

Let me try a different approach. Let's use the intersecting chords angle theorem. At point A, the angle between RQ and ST is equal to half the sum of the intercepted arcs. 

So, if I denote the measure of ∠QAS (the angle at A between QA and SA) as θ, then θ = ½(arc QS + arc RT). 

But how does this relate to the given angles? 

Maybe if I can express θ in terms of the given angles. 

For example, ∠QAS is part of triangle QAS, and maybe related to other angles. 

Alternatively, consider that ∠RST is an angle outside the intersecting chords. Wait, ∠RST is at point S, which is on the circle. 

Wait, maybe using the exterior angle theorem. For example, ∠RST is an inscribed angle, and perhaps it relates to the angle at A. 

Alternatively, think about the fact that ∠RST is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Wait, no, inscribed angles are half the intercepted arc. 

Wait, I think I'm getting confused between inscribed angles and angles formed by intersecting chords. Let me recall:

When two chords intersect inside a circle, the measure of the angle formed is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. 

So, for example, if two chords AB and CD intersect at E inside the circle, then ∠AEC = ½(arc AC + arc BD). 

Applying this to our case: lines RQ and ST intersect at A. So, the angle at A between RQ and ST would be ½(arc RS + arc QT). 

Wait, let me verify: the angle formed by two chords intersecting inside the circle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. So, if lines RQ and ST intersect at A, then the angle between RQ and ST at A would be ½(arc RST + arc Q...?) Wait, need to identify the arcs intercepted by the angle. 

Actually, the angle formed at A by chords AQ and AS (assuming lines RQ and ST intersect at A, so AQ is part of RQ, and AS is part of ST). Wait, perhaps I should think of the angle at A as formed by chords AR and AT? No, need to clarify. 

Let me define the angle at A between RA and SA. Wait, but lines RQ and ST intersect at A. So, line RQ passes through A, and line ST passes through A. So, the angle at A between RQ and ST would be between RA and SA, or between RA and TA, depending on the direction. 

But regardless, the angle at A would intercept arcs. Let me try to imagine: the angle at A is formed by chords AR and AS (if the lines are RQ and ST). Wait, no, line RQ goes from R to Q passing through A, and line ST goes from S to T passing through A. So, the angle at A between RQ and ST is between lines RA and SA (if we consider the angle between RA and SA). Or between RA and SA? 

Actually, the angle at A would be between the segments AR and AS if we follow the lines RQ and ST. Wait, no. Let me think carefully. 

At point A, along line RQ, we have points R---A---Q. Along line ST, we have points S---A---T. So, the angle at A between RQ and ST is the angle between RA and SA, which would be ∠RAS. 

According to the intersecting chords theorem, this angle ∠RAS is equal to ½(arc RS + arc QT). 

Now, how can I relate this to the given angles? 

Well, ∠RAS is part of triangle RAS, and possibly related to other angles in the diagram. 

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle RAS and using the angle sum. 

But I still don't see the connection to the given angles. 

Let me try to write down what I know:

From the intersecting chords theorem at point A:

∠RAS = ½(arc RS + arc QT) ... (1)

Also, since points R, S, T, Q are on the circle, arc RS + arc QT = arc RS + arc QT. 

Additionally, the given angles involve inscribed angles. 

For example, ∠RST is an inscribed angle intercepting arc RT. So:

∠RST = ½ arc RT ... (2)

Similarly, ∠QTS is an inscribed angle intercepting arc QS. So:

∠QTS = ½ arc QS ... (3)

And ∠QRS is an ins角 angle intercepting arc QS. Wait, ∠QRS is at point R, so it intercepts arc QS. Hence:

∠QRS = ½ arc QS ... (4)

From (3) and (4), since both ∠QTS and ∠QRS intercept arc QS, they should be equal. But according to the problem, ∠QRS = 32°, and ∠QTS = 6x - 2. So:

32 = 6x - 2 → 6x = 34 → x = 34/6 = 17/3 ≈ 5.666...

But let's keep it as fractions for now. 

So x = 17/3. 

Then, ∠RST = 5x + 4 = 5*(17/3) + 4 = 85/3 + 12/3 = 97/3 ≈ 32.33°. 

Now, from equation (2), ∠RST = ½ arc RT ⇒ arc RT = 2*(97/3) = 194/3 ≈ 64.666... degrees. 

From equation (4), ∠QRS = ½ arc QS ⇒ arc QS = 2*32 = 64°. 

So arc QS is 64°, arc RT is 194/3 ≈ 64.666... degrees. 

Now, returning to equation (1): ∠RAS = ½(arc RS + arc QT). 

But arc RS + arc QT is equal to arc RS + arc QT. How can we relate this to other arcs? 

Total circumference is 360°, so arc RS + arc QT + arc QS + arc RT = 360°? Wait, not necessarily, because the arcs depend on the arrangement of points. 

But if we assume that the points are ordered R, S, T, Q on the circle, then arc RS + arc ST + arc TQ + arc QR = 360°. But I'm not sure of the exact ordering. 

Alternatively, since arc QS is 64°, and arc RT is 194/3 ≈ 64.666°, and we need to find arc RS and arc QT. 

Wait, but arc RS is part of the circle. From arc RS, we can find it if we know other arcs. 

But I'm not sure. Let me think. 

Alternatively, since arc QS is 64°, and arc RT is 194/3 ≈ 64.666°, and arc RS + arc QT = ? 

Wait, from equation (1): ∠RAS = ½(arc RS + arc QT). But what is ∠RAS? 

∠RAS is an angle at point A, which is formed by the intersection of chords RQ and ST. This angle is also related to other angles in the diagram. 

But how? Let's consider triangle RAS. In triangle RAS, we have ∠RAS, ∠ARS, and ∠RSA. 

But ∠ARS is part of ∠QRS which is 32°, but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, consider that ∠RAS is related to the other angles. 

Alternatively, think about the angles at point S. 

We need to find m∠S, which might be ∠RST or another angle. 

Wait, the problem asks for m∠S. Given that ∠RST is given as 5x + 4, which we've expressed in terms of x. But if we can find x from the equality of ∠QRS and ∠QTS, then we can substitute back to find ∠RST, which might be the desired angle. 

Wait, earlier we found x = 17/3, leading to ∠RST = 97/3 ≈ 32.33°, but this doesn't match any of the options. The answer choices are 28, 30, 32, 34. 

Hmm, this suggests there's a mistake in my reasoning. Let me retrace. 

Earlier, I assumed that ∠QTS and ∠QRS both intercept arc QS, hence they should be equal. But this led to x = 17/3, resulting in ∠RST ≈ 32.33°, which is not among the choices. 

This indicates an error in the assumption that both ∠QTS and ∠QRS intercept the same arc. 

Let me reconsider: ∠QRS is at point R, formed by points Q, R, S. So it intercepts arc QS. 

∠QTS is at point T, formed by points Q, T, S. This angle intercepts arc QS as well, because it's formed by points Q, T, S. Wait, but if the points are arranged such that T is on the opposite side of the circle, then the intercepted arc would be the major arc QS or minor arc QS. 

Ah! Here's the key. If the points are arranged such that T is positioned such that the angle ∠QTS intercepts the major arc QS, while ∠QRS intercepts the minor arc QS. Thus, their measures would differ. 

Therefore, ∠QRS = ½(minor arc QS), and ∠QTS = ½(major arc QS). 

Thus, ∠QTS = ½(360° - minor arc QS). 

Since ∠QRS = 32° = ½(minor arc QS), then minor arc QS = 64°, and major arc QS = 360° - 64° = 296°. 

Therefore, ∠QTS = ½(296°) = 148°, which equals 6x - 2. 

Setting 6x - 2 = 148 → 6x = 150 → x = 25. 

Ah! This makes sense. Earlier, I incorrectly assumed both angles intercept the same arc, but actually, one intercepts the minor arc and the other the major arc. 

So with x = 25, let's compute the other angles. 

First, ∠RST = 5x + 4 = 5*25 + 4 = 125 + 4 = 129°. 

Now, this angle ∠RST is an inscribed angle intercepting arc RT. So:

∠RST = ½ arc RT → 129° = ½ arc RT → arc RT = 258°. 

Now, we can use the intersecting chords theorem at point A. 

Recall that ∠RAS = ½(arc RS + arc QT). 

But what is ∠RAS? Let's consider that ∠RAS is an angle at point A, formed by the intersection of RQ and ST. 

But how can we relate this to other angles? 

Alternatively, consider triangle RAS. In this triangle, we know ∠RAS and need to relate it to other angles. 

But perhaps using the fact that the sum of angles in triangle RAS is 180°. 

But to do that, we need to know other angles in the triangle. 

Alternatively, consider that ∠RAS is part of the angle formed by the intersecting chords, and maybe related to other angles in the diagram. 

Alternatively, let's consider the total circumference. 

Arc QS = 64° (minor), arc RT = 258°. 

What about the other arcs? Arc RS and arc QT. 

But total circumference is 360°, so:

arc RS + arc ST + arc TQ + arc QR = 360°. 

But without knowing the exact positioning of the points, this is tricky. 

Alternatively, since arc QS = 64° and arc RT = 258°, and arc RT includes arc RS + arc ST + arc TQ? No, arc RT is from R to T, passing through S and T? Not sure. 

Alternatively, since arc RT is 258°, which is the major arc RT, and arc QS is 64°, the minor arc QS. 

But I need to find arc RS and arc QT to use in equation (1). 

Wait, from equation (1): ∠RAS = ½(arc RS + arc QT). 

But what is ∠RAS? Let's think about it. 

Angle ∠RAS is formed by the intersection of RQ and ST at A. This angle is also related to other angles in the diagram. 

Alternatively, consider that ∠RAS and ∠QAS are vertical angles, and together with other angles, form straight lines. 

But I'm stuck here. Let me try another angle. 

We know that arc QS = 64°, arc RT = 258°. 

Let me try to find arc RS and arc QT. 

If I can find arc RS and arc QT, then I can compute ∠RAS from equation (1). 

But how? 

Let me think about the other given angle, ∠QTS = 148°, which is 6x - 2 with x=25. 

But ∠QTS is an inscribed angle intercepting arc QS (major arc), as discussed. 

Is there a way to find other arcs? 

Alternatively, since arc RT is 258°, which is the major arc from R to T. So the minor arc RT would be 360° - 258° = 102°. 

Wait, but ∠RST is an inscribed angle intercepting arc RT. But earlier, we said that ∠RST = 129° = ½ arc RT, which would mean arc RT is 258°, the major arc. So that makes sense. 

Now, what about arc RS? 

Let me think: arc QS = 64°, arc RT = 258°. 

Let me consider the full circle. 

If I can find the remaining arcs. 

Let me denote the arcs as follows:

Let’s denote arc QR as a, arc RS as b, arc ST as c, arc TQ as d. 

Then, the total circumference is a + b + c + d = 360°. 

But I need to relate these arcs to what we know. 

From earlier, arc QS = arc QR + arc RS = a + b = 64°. 

From arc RT: arc RT is arc RS + arc ST + arc TQ? No, arc RT is from R to T, which would be arc RS + arc ST + arc TQ? No, if moving from R to T through S and T, it would be arc RS + arc ST. Wait, no. If points are ordered R, S, T, Q on the circle, then arc RT would be arc RS + arc ST. 

Wait, this depends on the order of the points on the circle. Let me assume the points are arranged in the order R, S, T, Q around the circle. 

So, starting at R, going counterclockwise: R -> S -> T -> Q -> R. 

In this case:

- arc RS = b
- arc ST = c
- arc TQ = d
- arc QR = a

Then, arc RT would be arc RS + arc ST = b + c. 

But earlier, we determined that arc RT (major arc) is 258°, which would mean that the minor arc RT is 360° - 258° = 102°, so the minor arc RT is 102°, which would be arc RS + arc ST = b + c = 102°. 

Also, arc QS is arc QR + arc RS = a + b = 64°. 

Now, we also know from the intersecting chords theorem at point A: ∠RAS = ½(arc RS + arc QT) = ½(b + d). 

But what is ∠RAS? 

It's the angle at A between RA and SA, which is part of triangle RAS. 

But how can we find this angle? 

Maybe by considering other angles in the diagram. 

Alternatively, consider triangle RAS. In this triangle, we have:

∠RAS = ?
∠ARS = ?
∠RSA = ?

But ∠ARS is part of ∠QRS, which is 32°. 

Wait, ∠QRS is at point R, between Q, R, S. This angle is composed of ∠ARS and ∠ARS? No, ∠QRS is just ∠ARS. Wait, if the points are ordered R, S, T, Q, then ∠QRS is the angle at R between Q and S. So, this angle is formed by chords RQ and RS. 

But in this case, ∠QRS is an inscribed angle intercepting arc QS, which we already used. 

But how to relate ∠RAS to ∠QRS? 

Maybe through triangle RAS. Let's consider triangle RAS. In this triangle, ∠ARS is part of ∠QRS. 

Wait, ∠ARS is the angle at R between A and S. But ∠QRS is the angle at R between Q and S. Since A lies on RQ, ∠ARS is the same as ∠QRS. Wait, no. Because A is on RQ, so line RA is part of RQ. So ∠ARS is the angle at R between A and S, which is the same as ∠QRS. 

Wait, that means ∠ARS = ∠QRS = 32°. 

So in triangle RAS, we have ∠ARS = 32°, and we need to find other angles. 

If we can find ∠RAS or ∠RSA, we can use the triangle angle sum. 

But how? 

We know from the intersecting chords theorem that ∠RAS = ½(arc RS + arc QT) = ½(b + d). 

But we also know that in triangle RAS, the sum of angles is 180°, so:

∠RAS + ∠ARS + ∠RSA = 180°  
→ ∠RAS + 32° + ∠RSA = 180°  
→ ∠RAS + ∠RSA = 148° 

But what is ∠RSA? It is the angle at S between R and A. 

But ∠RSA is part of ∠RST, which is 129°. 

Because ∠RST is the angle at S between R and T. Since A is on ST, ∠RSA is part of ∠RST. Specifically, ∠RSA is the same as ∠RST. Wait, no. 

Wait, ∠RST is at point S between R and T. If A is on ST, then ∠RSA is the angle at S between R and A, which is part of ∠RST. So ∠RSA = ∠RST - ∠AST. 

But I don't know ∠AST. 

Alternatively, if A is on ST, then ∠RSA is part of ∠RST, but without knowing where A is located, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, since ∠RSA is an angle at S, and we know ∠RST = 129°, which is the whole angle at S between R and T. If we can express ∠RSA in terms of other angles. 

Alternatively, consider that ∠RSA is equal to ∠RAS? No, not necessarily. 

This seems too vague. Let me think of another approach. 

We know from earlier that arc RT (major) is 258°, so the minor arc RT is 102°, which is b + c = 102°. 

Also, arc QS = a + b = 64°. 

We also know that arc QR + arc RS + arc ST + arc TQ = a + b + c + d = 360°. 

But we have a + b = 64°, and b + c = 102°. 

So, subtracting these equations: (b + c) - (a + b) = 102° - 64° → c - a = 38° → c = a + 38°. 

Also, we need to find arc QT, which is d. 

But we need more relations. 

Let me recall that from the intersecting chords theorem at point A: ∠RAS = ½(b + d). 

But ∠RAS is also part of triangle RAS, where ∠RAS + ∠ARS + ∠RSA = 180°. 

If I can express ∠RSA in terms of other known quantities. 

Since ∠RSA is part of ∠RST = 129°, and if we can relate it to other angles. 

Alternatively, consider that ∠RSA is an inscribed angle intercepting arc RA? No, not sure. 

Alternatively, ∠RSA is an angle at S, formed by points R, S, A. Since A is on ST, ∠RSA is the same as ∠RST. Wait, no. If A is on ST, then ∠RSA is the angle at S between R and A, while ∠RST is the angle at S between R and T. So ∠RSA is a part of ∠RST. 

But without knowing where A is located on ST, it's difficult to determine the exact measure. 

However, if we consider that the angle ∠RSA is equal to ∠RAS? No, that would only be true if the triangle were isoceles, which we don't know. 

Alternatively, let's use the fact that the sum of angles in triangle RAS is 180°. 

We have:

∠RAS + ∠ARS + ∠RSA = 180°  
→ ½(b + d) + 32° + ∠RSA = 180°  
→ ∠RSA = 148° - ½(b + d) 

But also, ∠RSA is part of ∠RST = 129°. So:

∠RSA = ∠RST - ∠AST. 

But ∠AST is the angle at S between A and T. 

But ∠AST is an angle formed by points A, S, T. Since A is on ST, ∠AST is a straight line, so it's 180°, but that doesn't make sense. 

Wait, no. If A is on ST, then ∠AST is zero, because A is on the line ST. Wait, this suggests that my earlier assumption is wrong. 

Wait, if A is on ST, then the line ST passes through A, so point A is on ST. So, ∠AST is the angle at S between A and T, which is a straight line, hence 180°, but that would mean ∠RSA is zero, which is impossible. 

Clearly, there's confusion here. Let me correct. 

Point A is the intersection of RQ and ST. So, line ST passes through A, and line RQ passes through A. So, at point S, we have line ST passing through A, and line SR. 

Therefore, ∠RSA is the angle at S between R and A. Since A is on ST, ∠RSA is the same as ∠RST, because ∠RST is the angle at S between R and T, and since A is on ST, ∠RSA is the same as ∠RST. Wait, no. 

Wait, if you have point S, with line SR and line ST. Point A is on ST. So, ∠RSA is the angle at S between R and A, which is part of ∠RST. So, ∠RSA = ∠RST - ∠AST. But ∠AST is zero because A is on ST, so this suggests ∠RSA = ∠RST. Which implies that ∠RSA = 129°. 

But then, in triangle RAS, we have:

∠RAS + 32° + 129° = 180°  
→ ∠RAS = 180° - 32° - 129° = 19° 

So ∠RAS = 19°. 

But from the intersecting chords theorem, ∠RAS = ½(b + d). 

So:

19° = ½(b + d)  
→ b + d = 38° 

Now, recall from earlier:

a + b = 64° (from arc QS)  
b + c = 102° (from minor arc RT)  
c = a + 38°  
Also, total circumference: a + b + c + d = 360°. 

Substitute c = a + 38° into total circumference:

a + b + (a + 38°
