Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given information carefully. The problem mentions midsegments in triangle RST, specifically XY and XZ. Wait, midsegments usually connect midpoints of sides, so maybe I should check if points X, Y, Z, S, T, R are arranged in a certain way.

Looking at the predicates: Points R, Y, T, Z, S, X are defined. Lines include R-Y, Y-T, T-Z, Z-S, R-X, X-Z, X-S. Also, there's an angle measure at R-Y-X being 124 degrees. Lengths: Line Y-T is 13 units, Line R-Y is 7 units. The question asks for ST, given that XY and XZ are midsegments of triangle RST.

Wait, midsegments in a triangle are segments connecting the midpoints of two sides, and they're parallel to the third side and half its length. But here, it says XY and XZ are midsegments. Let me think. So, if XY is a midsegment, then it connects midpoints of two sides. Similarly for XZ. But how does that fit into triangle RST?

Let me try to visualize the triangle. Let's assume triangle RST. The midsegments would be connecting midpoints. Suppose X is a midpoint? Or perhaps X is connected to other points. Let me see the lines given. There's Line R-X, X-Z, X-S. Also, Line Y-T, T-Z, Z-S. So point Z is connected to T, S, and X. Point X is connected to R, Z, and S. 

Maybe triangle RST has points R, S, T. Then, midsegments could involve points like Y and Z. For example, if Y is the midpoint of RT, and Z is the midpoint of RS? Wait, but the lines given include Y-T, so Y is connected to T. Maybe Y is the midpoint of RT? Because if Y is the midpoint of RT, then Y-T would be half of RT. But the length of YT is given as 13. So RT would be 26? But also, RY is given as 7, which would mean that if Y is the midpoint of RT, then RY equals YT, so 7=13? That doesn't make sense. Therefore, my assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe Y is not the midpoint of RT. Let's think again. Since XY and XZ are midsegments. So midsegments are XY and XZ. Each midsegment connects midpoints of two sides. So, for example, XY could be a midsegment connecting midpoints of RS and RT, making it parallel to ST and half its length. But then XZ would be another midsegment. Wait, but how do these midsegments relate to the triangle?

Alternatively, maybe the triangle is RST, and the midsegments are XY and XZ. Let me consider that X is a midpoint of one side, and Y and Z are midpoints of others. For instance, if X is the midpoint of RT, then XY could be a midsegment connecting midpoints of RX and something else? Not sure yet.

Wait, perhaps we need to use the given lines. Let's list all the lines:

Lines given are:

- R-Y
- Y-T
- T-Z
- Z-S
- R-X
- X-Z
- X-S

So, points:

R connected to Y and X.

Y connected to T.

T connected to Z.

Z connected to S, X.

X connected to Z and S.

Also, S is connected to Z and X.

So, perhaps the triangle is RST. Let me try to map the points.

Assume triangle RST. Let's think about where points X, Y, Z are located.

Given that XY and XZ are midsegments. So, each midsegment connects midpoints of two sides.

Suppose that XY is a midsegment. So, X and Y are midpoints of two sides. Similarly, XZ is another midsegment, implying X and Z are midpoints of two other sides.

But since X is part of both XY and XZ, perhaps X is a common midpoint. Let me think.

For example, suppose X is the midpoint of RS. Then, if XY is a midsegment, then Y would be the midpoint of RT. Because midsegments connect midpoints of two sides. So if X is the midpoint of RS and Y is the midpoint of RT, then segment XY would be a midsegment parallel to ST and half its length.

Similarly, if XZ is another midsegment, then Z would be the midpoint of... Well, if X is already the midpoint of RS, then Z could be the midpoint of another side. Wait, but there's a line from Z to S and Z to T. Wait, looking back at the lines:

There's a line T-Z, Z-S, X-Z. So Z is connected to T, S, and X. So Z is connected to three points: T, S, and X. So maybe Z is the midpoint of some side?

Wait, if Z is the midpoint of ST, then line Z-S would be half of ST. But then line T-Z is also present. Hmm. Alternatively, Z could be the midpoint of RT? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe triangle RST has midpoints at Y, Z, and X. Let me try to reconstruct.

Since XY is a midsegment, and XZ is another midsegment. So, if X is a midpoint, then XY and XZ would be midsegments from X. Let's say X is the midpoint of RT. Then, XY could be connecting X (midpoint of RT) to Y, which would be the midpoint of RS. Then XY would be a midsegment parallel to ST. Similarly, XZ would be connecting X (midpoint of RT) to Z, which is the midpoint of RS? No, that would be same as Y. Maybe not.

Alternatively, if X is the midpoint of RS. Then XY could be connecting X (midpoint of RS) to Y, the midpoint of RT. And XZ could be connecting X (midpoint of RS) to Z, the midpoint of ST. In that case, XY and XZ would be two midsegments. However, in that scenario, midsegments XY and XZ would be parallel to ST and RT respectively? Wait, no. Midsegments are parallel to the third side. So if XY connects midpoints of RS and RT, then it's parallel to ST. Similarly, if XZ connects midpoints of RS and ST, then it's parallel to RT. But the problem states that XY and XZ are midsegments. So that seems possible.

Now, considering that, let's look at the given lengths. We know that the length of YT is 13. If Y is the midpoint of RT, then RT would be twice YT, so RT = 2*13 = 26. But also, we have the length of RY is 7. If Y is the midpoint of RT, then RY would be half of RT, so RY = RT/2 → RT = 14. But that contradicts the earlier calculation of RT = 26. Hence, contradiction. Therefore, Y cannot be the midpoint of RT.

Hmm. So perhaps Y is not the midpoint of RT. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the line Y-T exists. So Y is connected to T. Also, there's a line R-Y. So R-Y is a side. If Y is a midpoint, perhaps of R-something. Let me think again.

Another approach: since XY and XZ are midsegments, then they should be midlines. Each midline connects midpoints of two sides and is parallel to the third side. So, for example, if XY is a midline, then it connects midpoints of two sides. Similarly for XZ.

Let me consider that X is the midpoint of one side, say RS. Then, XY would be a midline connecting X (midpoint of RS) to Y, which is the midpoint of RT. Then XY would be parallel to ST. Similarly, XZ could be a midline connecting X (midpoint of RS) to Z, which is the midpoint of ST. Then XZ would be parallel to RT. But then, the problem states that XZ is a midsegment, so that would make sense.

But then, how does this fit with the given lines and points?

We have points R, Y, T, Z, S, X. Let me try to assign coordinates to see if that helps.

Let me assign coordinates to the points to model the situation. Let me place point R at (0, 0). Suppose that RY is 7 units. Let me assume that Y is somewhere such that RY is 7. Let me choose coordinates for simplicity. Let me set R at (0, 0), Y at (7, 0) because RY is 7 units long. Then, since YT is 13 units, and Y is at (7, 0), point T would be somewhere such that the distance from Y(7,0) to T is 13. Let me pick coordinates for T. For simplicity, maybe T is along the x-axis? Let's say T is at (7 + 13, 0) = (20, 0). But wait, then Y-T would be horizontal, but then we'd have points R(0,0), Y(7,0), T(20,0), making RT = 20 units. But then if Y is the midpoint of RT, then RY should be half of RT, so RY would be 10, but given RY is 7, which conflicts. Hence, that can't be. So T isn't aligned with R and Y on the x-axis.

Alternatively, let me suppose that Y is not on the same line as R and T. Let me assign coordinates more generally. Let me take R at (0,0), Y at (a,b), and T at some coordinate. Given that the length of RY is 7, so sqrt(a² + b²) = 7. The length of YT is 13, so sqrt((T_x - a)^2 + (T_y - b)^2) = 13. But without knowing coordinates of T, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, since there's an angle given: Angle(R,Y,X) is 124 degrees. So at point Y, the angle between RY and YX is 124 degrees. So, in terms of vectors, the angle at Y between RY and YX is 124°. This might be useful later.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me go back to the midsegments. Since XY and XZ are midsegments, they are each half the length of the side they're parallel to. So if XY is a midsegment, then its length is half of ST. Similarly, if XZ is a midsegment, then its length is half of RT. But wait, depends on which sides they are parallel to.

Wait, if XY is a midsegment, then it's parallel to ST and half its length. Similarly, XZ would be parallel to RT and half its length. Wait, but if XZ is a midsegment, then it's connecting midpoints of two sides. Let me think again.

Assuming that X is the midpoint of one side, say RS. Then, if XY is a midsegment, then Y is the midpoint of RT, and XY is parallel to ST. Similarly, if XZ is a midsegment, then Z is the midpoint of another side. For example, if X is the midpoint of RS, then Z could be the midpoint of ST. Then XZ would be a midsegment connecting midpoints of RS and ST, hence parallel to RT and half its length.

In that case, the length of XZ would be half of RT. But we don't know RT's length yet. However, we know that YT is 13. If Y is the midpoint of RT, then RT would be 26. But earlier that conflicted with RY being 7. Unless Y is not the midpoint of RT. Wait, but if Y is the midpoint of RT, then RY would be half of RT. But given RY is 7, then RT would be 14. But YT is given as 13. That suggests inconsistency unless there's a miscalculation.

Wait, if Y is the midpoint of RT, then RY = YT. But here, RY is 7 and YT is 13, which contradicts. Therefore, Y cannot be the midpoint of RT. Thus, my previous assumption is incorrect.

Alternative idea: Maybe Y is the midpoint of another side. For example, if Y is the midpoint of RS. Wait, but then line Y-T would imply that Y is connected to T. Let me try.

If Y is the midpoint of RS, then line R-Y is half of RS. But then line Y-T connects Y to T. If Y is the midpoint of RS, then T could be any point. But how does this tie in with the midsegments XY and XZ?

Alternatively, since XY is a midsegment, it connects midpoints of two sides. Suppose that X is the midpoint of RT, and Y is the midpoint of RS. Then, segment XY would be a midsegment parallel to ST, with length half of ST. Similarly, if XZ is a midsegment, then Z would be the midpoint of another side. For example, if Z is the midpoint of ST, then XZ would be a midsegment connecting midpoints of RT and ST, thus parallel to RS, with length half of RS. But then, how does that fit with the given data?

Alternatively, maybe X is the midpoint of RS, and Y is the midpoint of RT. Then XY would be a midsegment parallel to ST. But then, as before, RY would be half of RT. But given that RY is 7, then RT is 14. However, YT is given as 13, which would mean that the length from Y to T is 13, which would conflict with RT being 14. Unless Y is not the midpoint of RT. Wait, but if Y is the midpoint of RT, then YT should be equal to RY, i.e., 7. But the given YT is 13. So that's impossible.

This contradiction suggests that my initial assumption about the configuration is wrong. Perhaps the midsegments are not directly involving Y and Z as midpoints. Let me think differently.

The problem states that XY and XZ are midsegments of triangle RST. So each of these is a midsegment. That means each connects midpoints of two sides. So, there are two midsegments: one is XY, another is XZ. Since both start at X, X must be a common midpoint. Therefore, X is the midpoint of one side, and the other endpoints Y and Z are midpoints of other sides.

So, for example, X is the midpoint of RS. Then, XY connects X to Y (midpoint of RT), and XZ connects X to Z (midpoint of ST). Thus, XY is parallel to ST, and XZ is parallel to RT. In this case, the lengths of XY and XZ would be half of ST and RT, respectively.

But how does this align with the given data? Let's explore.

If X is the midpoint of RS, then:

- XY is a midsegment, so XY || ST and XY = ½ ST.

- XZ is a midsegment, so XZ || RT and XZ = ½ RT.

Additionally, the line YT is given as 13. If Y is the midpoint of RT, then YT would be half of RT. Wait, but if Y is the midpoint of RT, then RT = 2 * YT = 26. But then, since XZ is parallel to RT and XZ = ½ RT, then XZ would be 13. But we don't have info about XZ's length. Alternatively, maybe there's another relation.

But we also have RY = 7. If Y is the midpoint of RT, then RY = ½ RT → RT = 14. But then YT would be 7, conflicting with the given YT = 13. Hence, contradiction again. So, this implies that Y is not the midpoint of RT. Hence, my assumption is invalid.

Wait, maybe Y is not the midpoint of RT. Let me think. Suppose that Y is the midpoint of another side. For example, if Y is the midpoint of RS, then line Y-T connects midpoint of RS to T. How does that work?

If Y is the midpoint of RS, then XY is a midsegment connecting X to Y. Wait, but X is supposed to be the midpoint of another side. For instance, if X is the midpoint of RT, then XY would connect midpoints of RT and RS, making it parallel to ST. In this case, XY would be parallel to ST and half its length. But then, what is the length of XY?

But we don't have the length of XY given. However, we know that angle at Y (Angle(R,Y,X)) is 124 degrees. Maybe we can use that with some trigonometry.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find relations between the sides using the given angle and lengths.

Let me try to focus on the given angle. At point Y, the angle between RY and YX is 124 degrees. So, triangle RYX has angle at Y of 124 degrees. We know RY = 7, and we might be able to find YX if we can determine other sides or use the Law of Cosines.

But how?

If we can find YX, then perhaps we can use the fact that XY is a midsegment. Assuming XY is a midsegment, then XY = ½ ST. So, if we can compute XY, then ST would be twice that.

But how to find YX?

To find YX, we need more information. Let's see what we know about the figure. We have lines R-Y, Y-T, T-Z, Z-S, R-X, X-Z, X-S.

So, points X and Z are connected to S and T. Let me think about the position of X and Z.

If XY is a midsegment, then X is the midpoint of one side. Suppose X is the midpoint of RS. Then, line R-X is half of RS. Also, line X-Z connects X to Z. If Z is the midpoint of another side, say RT, then line X-Z would connect midpoints of RS and RT, making it a midsegment parallel to ST. But earlier issues arise with YT length.

Alternatively, maybe Z is the midpoint of ST. Then, line Z-S would be half of ST. Also, line T-Z would be half of ST. But how does this connect with other elements?

Alternatively, maybe triangle RST has midsegments XY and XZ, meaning that X is the midpoint of RS, Y is the midpoint of RT, and Z is the midpoint of ST. Then, XY and XZ are two midsegments, each parallel to a different side. 

But then, as before, if Y is the midpoint of RT, then RY = YT. But given RY = 7 and YT = 13, this is impossible. Hence, contradiction.

Wait, but maybe Y is not the midpoint of RT. Let me think: If XY is a midsegment, then it connects midpoints of two sides. Suppose that X is the midpoint of RS and Y is the midpoint of RT. Then, even though RY is not equal to YT, this would still be a midsegment? No, because midsegments require that the connecting points are midpoints of two sides. So if Y is the midpoint of RT, then RY should equal YT. Hence, the given lengths contradict this. Therefore, Y cannot be the midpoint of RT.

Therefore, perhaps Y is the midpoint of another side. Like, if Y is the midpoint of RT, but somehow the length RY ≠ YT? No, that's not possible. Midpoints divide the segment into two equal parts. So if Y is the midpoint of RT, then RY = YT. Hence, given that RY = 7 and YT = 13, Y cannot be the midpoint of RT. Hence, Y must be the midpoint of another side, like RT is not involved. Wait, but RT is a side of the triangle. So the sides are RS, RT, and ST.

If Y is the midpoint of RS, then RY = YS = 7. But then, since Y is the midpoint of RS, line Y-T connects Y to T. How does that help?

Let me try this configuration: Assume that Y is the midpoint of RS. Then, RY = YS = 7. So RS = 14. Now, line YT is given as 13. So from point Y to T is 13. What is T's position? It's a vertex of the triangle. Then, if we can relate this with other points.

Also, X is connected to R and Z. If X is the midpoint of another side. Let's say X is the midpoint of RT. Then, line R-X is half of RT. But then, line X-Z connects X to Z. If Z is the midpoint of ST, then XZ would be a midsegment connecting midpoints of RT and ST, hence parallel to RS. But then, in this case, XY is a midsegment connecting Y (midpoint of RS) to X (midpoint of RT), which would be parallel to ST. So, XY is parallel to ST, and its length is half of ST. 

But then, how does this relate to the given angle at Y? At point Y, we have angle RYX = 124 degrees. So, in triangle RYX, we have RY = 7, angle at Y is 124 degrees, and we need to find YX. If we can find YX, then since XY is a midsegment, XY = ½ ST, so ST = 2 * YX.

So, let's try to calculate YX using the Law of Cosines in triangle RYX. But for that, we need to know the length of RX or something else. Wait, we don't know RX. But maybe we can find it via other relations.

If X is the midpoint of RT, then RX = ½ RT. But we don't know RT. However, if we can express RT in terms of other variables...

Wait, let's think about the coordinates again. Let me try assigning coordinates with this new assumption.

Let me place point R at (0, 0). Since Y is the midpoint of RS, and RY = 7, then Y is at (a, b) such that the distance from R(0,0) to Y(a,b) is 7. Let me assume for simplicity that RS lies along the x-axis. So, let me set S at (14, 0), since RY = 7 and Y is midpoint of RS, then RY = YS = 7 → RS = 14. So, S is at (14, 0), Y is at (7, 0).

Then, point T is somewhere. We know that YT = 13. So, from Y(7, 0), the distance to T(x, y) is 13: √[(x-7)^2 + (y-0)^2] = 13.

Also, X is the midpoint of RT. Since R is (0,0), and T is (x,y), then X would be at ((0+x)/2, (0+y)/2) = (x/2, y/2).

Also, line XZ connects X to Z. Where is Z? If Z is the midpoint of ST, then since S is (14, 0) and T is (x,y), then Z is at ((14 + x)/2, (0 + y)/2) = ((14 + x)/2, y/2).

So, X is at (x/2, y/2), Z is at ((14 + x)/2, y/2). So line XZ connects these two points. The coordinates of X and Z have the same y-coordinate, so XZ is a horizontal line. Its length is [(14 + x)/2 - x/2] = 14/2 = 7. So XZ = 7. But according to the midsegment property, XZ should be parallel to RS and half its length. RS is 14, so half is 7. That checks out. So XZ = 7. But we don't have info about XZ's length. 

Now, back to the angle at Y: Angle(R,Y,X) is 124 degrees. So, at point Y(7,0), the angle between RY and YX is 124 degrees. Vector RY goes from Y to R: R is at (0,0), so vector YR is (-7, 0). Vector YX goes from Y(7,0) to X(x/2, y/2): (x/2 - 7, y/2 - 0) = (x/2 -7, y/2).

The angle between these two vectors is 124 degrees. Using the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (vector YR · vector YX) / (|YR| |YX|)

Compute the dot product:

(-7)(x/2 -7) + (0)(y/2) = -7*(x/2 -7) = -7x/2 + 49.

|YR| is the magnitude of YR, which is 7.

|YX| is sqrt[(x/2 -7)^2 + (y/2)^2].

So,

cos(124°) = (-7x/2 +49) / [7 * sqrt((x/2 -7)^2 + (y/2)^2)]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: -7x/2 +49 = 7*(-x/2 +7) = 7*(7 - x/2)

Denominator: 7 * sqrt(...)

So cos(124°) = (7 - x/2) / sqrt((x/2 -7)^2 + (y/2)^2)

Note that (x/2 -7) = -(7 - x/2), so sqrt(...) becomes sqrt[(7 - x/2)^2 + (y/2)^2]

Thus, cos(124°) = (7 - x/2) / sqrt[(7 - x/2)^2 + (y/2)^2]

Let me denote A = 7 - x/2, B = y/2. Then,

cos(124°) = A / sqrt(A^2 + B^2)

Which implies that tan(theta) = B/A, where theta is 124°, so:

tan(124°) = B/A

But tan(124°) is tan(180° - 56°) = -tan(56°) ≈ -1.4826.

So:

B/A = -tan(56°)

But B = y/2, A = 7 - x/2.

So, y/2 divided by (7 - x/2) equals -tan(56°).

Therefore:

y / (14 - x) = -2 tan(56°)

But we also know that the distance from Y(7,0) to T(x,y) is 13:

√[(x -7)^2 + y^2] = 13 → (x-7)^2 + y^2 = 169.

Expand (x-7)^2: x² -14x +49.

So:

x² -14x +49 + y² = 169 → x² + y² -14x = 120.

But we also have from the above equation:

y = -2 tan(56°) (14 - x)

Let me compute tan(56°). Let me recall that tan(56°) ≈ 1.4826. So approximately -2*1.4826 = -2.9652. So y ≈ -2.9652*(14 - x).

Let me plug this into the equation x² + y² -14x = 120.

First, square both sides:

y² = [ -2.9652*(14 - x) ]² = (2.9652)^2*(14 -x)^2 ≈ 8.793*(14 -x)^2.

So substituting into x² + y² -14x = 120:

x² + 8.793*(14 -x)^2 -14x = 120.

Expand (14 -x)^2 = 196 -28x +x².

So:

x² + 8.793*(196 -28x +x²) -14x = 120.

Calculate term by term:

First, expand 8.793*(196) = approx 8.793 * 196. Let me compute that:

Approximate 8 * 196 = 1568, 0.793*196 ≈ 155.428 → total ≈ 1568 + 155.428 ≈ 1723.428.

Next, 8.793*(-28x) = -246.204x.

8.793*x² = 8.793x².

So overall:

x² + 1723.428 -246.204x +8.793x² -14x = 120.

Combine like terms:

(1 +8.793)x² + (-246.204x -14x) + 1723.428 = 120.

That is:

9.793x² -260.204x + 1723.428 = 120.

Subtract 120:

9.793x² -260.204x + 1603.428 = 0.

Divide all terms by 9.793 to simplify:

x² - (260.204 / 9.793)x + (1603.428 / 9.793) = 0.

Calculating coefficients:

260.204 / 9.793 ≈ 26.6.

1603.428 / 9.793 ≈ 163.7.

So approximately:

x² -26.6x + 163.7 = 0.

Solving quadratic equation:

Discriminant D = (26.6)^2 - 4*1*163.7 ≈ 707.56 - 654.8 = 52.76.

Square root of D ≈ 7.26.

Solutions:

x = [26.6 ±7.26]/2.

So x ≈ (26.6 +7.26)/2 ≈ 33.86/2 ≈ 16.93, or x ≈ (26.6 -7.26)/2 ≈ 19.34/2 ≈ 9.67.

So x ≈ 16.93 or 9.67.

Let me consider both possibilities.

First, x ≈ 16.93. Then, substitute back to find y.

From earlier, y ≈ -2.9652*(14 -x).

For x=16.93: 14 -x = -2.93. So y ≈ -2.9652*(-2.93) ≈ 8.68.

Second possibility: x≈9.67. Then, 14 -x = 4.33. So y ≈ -2.9652*4.33 ≈ -12.83.

Now, we need to check which of these makes sense.

Let me first consider x≈16.93, y≈8.68. Then, point T is (16.93, 8.68). Let's check the distance YT: from Y(7,0) to T(16.93,8.68):

Δx = 16.93 -7 = 9.93, Δy = 8.68 -0 = 8.68.

Distance squared: 9.93² + 8.68² ≈ 98.6 + 75.3 ≈ 173.9, which is close to 13² = 169. Close enough considering rounding errors.

For the second case, x≈9.67, y≈-12.83. Distance from Y(7,0) to T(9.67,-12.83):

Δx=9.67-7=2.67, Δy=-12.83-0=-12.83. Squared distance: 2.67² + (-12.83)^2 ≈ 7.13 + 164.6 ≈ 171.7, which is also close to 169, within approximation error.

So both solutions are possible.

Now, let's analyze which one fits the rest of the diagram.

Recall that X is the midpoint of RT. So, for the first case, T is (16.93, 8.68). R is at (0,0). So, midpoint X is ((0+16.93)/2, (0+8.68)/2) ≈ (8.465, 4.34). 

Then, Y is at (7,0). The angle at Y between RY and YX is 124 degrees. Let's verify this angle.

Vector YR is from Y to R: (0-7, 0-0) = (-7, 0).

Vector YX is from Y to X: (8.465-7, 4.34-0) = (1.465, 4.34).

Compute the angle between (-7, 0) and (1.465, 4.34).

Dot product: (-7)(1.465) + 0*4.34 = -10.255.

Magnitude of YR: 7.

Magnitude of YX: sqrt(1.465² +4.34²) ≈ sqrt(2.146 + 18.835) ≈ sqrt(20.98) ≈ 4.58.

So cos(theta) = -10.255/(7 * 4.58) ≈ -10.255 / 32.06 ≈ -0.32. Which corresponds to an angle of arccos(-0.32) ≈ 109 degrees, not 124. So this doesn't match. Hence, this case is invalid.

Now check the second case: x≈9.67, y≈-12.83. So T is (9.67, -12.83). Midpoint X is ((0 +9.67)/2, (0 + (-12.83))/2) ≈ (4.835, -6.415).

Vector YR is (-7, 0). Vector YX is (4.835 -7, -6.415 -0) = (-2.165, -6.415).

Dot product: (-7)*(-2.165) + 0*(-6.415) = 15.155.

Magnitude of YR: 7.

Magnitude of YX: sqrt((-2.165)^2 + (-6.415)^2) ≈ sqrt(4.69 + 41.15) ≈ sqrt(45.84) ≈ 6.77.

So cos(theta) = 15.155 / (7 * 6.77) ≈ 15.155 / 47.39 ≈ 0.319. So theta ≈ arccos(0.319) ≈ 71 degrees. Not matching 124 degrees. So this also doesn't fit.

Hmm, this suggests that my assumptions may be wrong. Maybe X is not the midpoint of RT. Let me reconsider.

Perhaps X is the midpoint of ST instead. Let's try that.

If X is the midpoint of ST, then line R-X connects R to X. Also, lines X-Z and X-S. Since X is midpoint of ST, then S is connected to X, and Z is connected to X and T. Let me try to build this.

Assume X is the midpoint of ST. Then, line X-S is half of ST. Also, line X-Z connects X to Z. If Z is the midpoint of another side, like RT, then line XZ would be a midsegment connecting midpoints of ST and RT, hence parallel to SR and half its length.

But then, what about the midsegment XY? If XY is a midsegment, then it connects midpoints of two sides. Suppose Y is the midpoint of RS. Then, line XY connects X (midpoint of ST) to Y (midpoint of RS). This would be a midsegment parallel to RT and half its length.

In this case, XY is parallel to RT, and its length is half of RT. Also, the angle at Y between RY and YX is 124 degrees.

But how to relate this with given lengths?

Given that RY is 7, which would be half of RS if Y is the midpoint of RS. So RS = 14. Also, YT is 13. But Y is the midpoint of RS, so YT is the distance from Y to T. Let me try to model this.

Let me assign coordinates again. Let me place R at (0,0), S at (14,0), so that RS = 14. Y is the midpoint of RS, so Y is at (7,0). Now, point T is somewhere. Line YT has length 13. So from Y(7,0) to T(x,y) is 13. So, (x-7)^2 + y^2 = 169.

Now, X is the midpoint of ST. S is at (14,0), T is at (x,y). So X is at ((14 + x)/2, (0 + y)/2) = ((14+x)/2, y/2).

Now, line XY connects X to Y(7,0). Let's compute the coordinates of X: ((14+x)/2, y/2). So vector YX is from Y to X: ((14+x)/2 -7, y/2 -0) = ((x/2 + 14/2 -14/2), y/2) = (x/2, y/2). Wait, that simplifies to (x/2, y/2).

So vector YX is (x/2, y/2). Vector YR is from Y to R: R is (0,0), so YR vector is (-7, 0).

The angle between YR and YX is 124 degrees. Using the dot product:

cos(theta) = (YR · YX) / (|YR| |YX|)

YR · YX = (-7)*(x/2) + 0*(y/2) = -7x/2.

|YR| = 7.

|YX| = sqrt( (x/2)^2 + (y/2)^2 ) = (1/2)sqrt(x² + y²).

So:

cos(124°) = (-7x/2) / [7 * (1/2)sqrt(x² + y²)] = (-x)/sqrt(x² + y²).

So:

cos(124°) = -x / sqrt(x² + y²).

Let me note that x and y satisfy (x-7)^2 + y^2 = 169.

Expand this: x² -14x +49 + y² = 169 → x² + y² = 169 +14x -49 = 120 +14x.

So sqrt(x² + y²) = sqrt(120 +14x).

Thus, the equation becomes:

cos(124°) = -x / sqrt(120 +14x).

Let me compute cos(124°). Since 124 degrees is in the second quadrant, cosine is negative. Let me calculate it numerically.

cos(124°) = cos(90° + 34°) = -sin(34°) ≈ -0.5592.

So:

-0.5592 = -x / sqrt(120 +14x).

Multiply both sides by -1:

0.5592 = x / sqrt(120 +14x).

Square both sides:

0.5592² = x² / (120 +14x).

Calculate left side: 0.5592² ≈ 0.3126.

So:

0.3126 = x² / (120 +14x).

Multiply both sides by (120 +14x):

0.3126*(120 +14x) = x².

Expand:

0.3126*120 + 0.3126*14x = x².

Calculate:

0.3126*120 ≈ 37.512.

0.3126*14 ≈ 4.3764.

So:

37.512 + 4.3764x = x².

Rewriting:

x² -4.3764x -37.512 = 0.

Solve this quadratic equation:

x = [4.3764 ± sqrt( (4.3764)^2 + 4*37.512 )]/2.

Calculate discriminant:

(4.3764)^2 ≈ 19.15.

4*37.512 ≈ 150.048.

Total discriminant ≈ 19.15 + 150.048 ≈ 169.198.

sqrt(169.198) ≈ 13.01.

So x ≈ [4.3764 ±13.01]/2.

Two solutions:

x = (4.3764 +13.01)/2 ≈ 17.3864/2 ≈ 8.6932.

Or x = (4.3764 -13.01)/2 ≈ -8.6336/2 ≈ -4.3168.

Now, let's evaluate these.

First, x ≈ 8.6932. Let's find y from x² + y² = 120 +14x.

Plugging x=8.6932:

x² = (8.6932)^2 ≈ 75.57.

120 +14x = 120 +14*8.6932 ≈ 120 +121.705 ≈ 241.705.

So y² = 241.705 -75.57 ≈ 166.135 → y ≈ ±12.89.

Now, check the original equation: cos(124°) = -x / sqrt(x² + y²) ≈ -8.6932 / sqrt(241.705) ≈ -8.6932 / 15.55 ≈ -0.559, which matches our earlier calculation. Good.

Now, check for x ≈ -4.3168:

x² = (-4.3168)^2 ≈ 18.63.

120 +14x = 120 +14*(-4.3168) ≈ 120 -60.435 ≈ 59.565.

y² = 59.565 -18.63 ≈ 40.935 → y ≈ ±6.4.

Check cos(124°) = -x / sqrt(x² + y²) ≈ -(-4.3168)/sqrt(59.565) ≈ 4.3168 / 7.72 ≈ 0.56. But cos(124°) is negative, so this is invalid. Hence, discard this solution.

Thus, valid solution is x ≈ 8.6932, y ≈ ±12
