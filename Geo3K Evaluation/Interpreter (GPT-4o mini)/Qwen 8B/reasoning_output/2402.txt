MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have Circle O with radius 13 inches. There's a radius OB that's perpendicular to a chord CD, which is 24 inches long. We need to find OX. Hmm, first, I need to visualize this. Let me sketch it mentally.

Alright, so Circle O. Let me recall some circle theorems. One thing I remember is that if a radius is perpendicular to a chord, it bisects the chord. Wait, yes! That's a key property. So if OB is perpendicular to CD, then OB must bisect CD at its midpoint. Since CD is 24 inches, the midpoint would divide it into two segments each of length 12 inches. 

So, if I imagine point E where OB intersects CD, then CE = ED = 12 inches. Now, since OB is a radius, its length is 13 inches. But wait, OB is perpendicular to CD, forming a right triangle. Let me think. The right triangle here would be triangle OEC, where OE is part of OB, EC is half of CD, and OC is the radius. 

Wait, OC is the hypotenuse here because O is the center, and C is a point on the circle. So, applying the Pythagorean theorem to triangle OEC: OE² + EC² = OC². We know OC is 13 inches, EC is 12 inches. Plugging those numbers in: OE² + 12² = 13². Calculating that gives OE² + 144 = 169. Subtracting 144 from both sides: OE² = 25. Taking the square root, OE = 5 inches. 

But wait, the question asks for OX. Oh, maybe X is the same as E? Because OB is the radius perpendicular to CD, and X could be the foot of the perpendicular from O to CD, which is point E. Therefore, OX would be OE, which is 5 inches. Looking at the answer choices, A is 5. So the answer should be A. Let me double-check my steps.

First, confirming the theorem: a perpendicular from the center to a chord does bisect the chord. Correct. Then, using Pythagoras: yes, since OE and EC are legs, and OC is the hypotenuse. Calculation: 13 squared is 169, 12 squared is 144, difference is 25, sqrt(25) is 5. All steps make sense. So OX is 5, answer A.
