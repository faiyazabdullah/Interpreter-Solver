Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me list them again:

- Measure of Angle(U, V, W) = 3x - 11
- Measure of Angle(V, U, Z) = x - 8
- Measure of Angle(W, Z, U) = 2x + 7
- Measure of Angle(Z, Y, W) = x
- Measure of Angle(Y, W, V) = x + 8

The question asks for the measure of angle W. Wait, angle W—probably referring to ∠UWZ? Or maybe another angle involving point W? Hmm, but since there are multiple points mentioned, I need to visualize the diagram. Since the problem doesn't provide a diagram, I'll have to infer the structure based on the angles given.

Let me try to sketch the scenario mentally. Points involved are U, V, W, Z, Y. The angles given involve these points. Let me note down each angle:

1. ∠UVW = 3x - 11 (Angle at V between U and W)
Wait, no—the first one is MeasureOf(Angle(U, V, W)). In standard notation, Angle(A, B, C) means the angle at point B between points A and C. So ∠UVW would be the angle at V between U and W. Similarly, others:

- ∠UVW = 3x - 11
- ∠VUZ = x - 8 (Angle at U between V and Z)
- ∠WZU = 2x + 7 (Angle at Z between W and U)
- ∠ZYW = x (Angle at Y between Z and W)
- ∠YWV = x + 8 (Angle at W between Y and V)

Hmm, so perhaps these angles form a polygon or intersecting lines? Maybe there's a pentagon or some triangle configuration?

Alternatively, considering that multiple angles are given around certain points. For example, looking at point Z: angles involving Z are ∠WZU (at Z), ∠ZYW (at Y?), wait, maybe I should consider if these angles form parts of triangles or intersecting lines.

Alternatively, maybe these angles are part of a larger figure like a star or a polygon. But without seeing the diagram, it's challenging. However, since we're dealing with angles, perhaps there's a triangle where several of these angles are parts of.

Another thought: if these angles are part of a triangle, their sum would be 180 degrees. But let's check if any three angles could form a triangle.

Looking at the angles involving point U: ∠VUZ (x -8) and ∠UVW (3x -11). Also, maybe ∠WZU (2x +7) is part of another triangle.

Alternatively, think about triangle UWZ. Let me see:

In triangle UWZ, the angles would be at U, W, and Z. But the given angles may not directly correspond. Wait, ∠WZU is at Z, which would be one angle of triangle UWZ. Then, ∠UWZ (which is the angle at W) is what we need to find. But wait, the problem says "m∠W"—so maybe it refers to ∠UWZ?

But also, there's another angle at W: ∠YWV (x +8). That suggests that point Y is connected to W and V, forming another angle. Perhaps there's a transversal or something else.

Alternatively, maybe all these angles are part of a cyclic quadrilateral or something with intersecting lines. Alternatively, think of two intersecting lines creating vertical angles, but with more than two lines.

Alternatively, maybe the points form a pentagon, and these angles are internal or external angles. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to tell. However, since we have multiple equations involving x, maybe we can set up equations based on angle sums in various polygons or triangles.

Let me consider possible triangles. Suppose there's a triangle involving points U, V, W. The angles at those points would be ∠UVW (given as 3x -11), ∠VUZ (but that's at U, so maybe part of another triangle). Wait, ∠VUZ is at point U between V and Z. So that would imply that Z is a point such that line UZ creates an angle with UV. So maybe points U, V, Z are connected in some way.

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle UZW, where ∠WZU is given as 2x +7, and ∠UWZ is what we need. But then, if we can find the third angle of that triangle, which would be at U. But where does that angle come from?

Wait, the angle at U in triangle UZW would be ∠ZUW. Is that given? Not directly. But maybe ∠ZUW is part of another angle given here. For instance, the angle at U between V and Z is ∠VUZ = x -8. So if Z is a point such that line UZ splits the angle at U into two parts: one being ∠VUZ (x-8) and another part. Unless line VZ is involved.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to find relations between the given angles.

First, note that all the given angles have measures expressed in terms of x. Therefore, if we can find an equation involving x, we can solve for x and then compute the desired angle.

So, the plan is to find an equation that relates these angles, possibly through the sum of angles in a triangle or around a point.

Let me look for possible triangles where the sum of angles equals 180°.

For example, consider triangle VWZ. Let me check if that's possible. The angles in triangle VWZ would be:

At V: ∠UVW (if Z is connected to V?) Wait, not sure. Alternatively, suppose triangle UZV. The angles would be:

At U: ∠VUZ (x-8)
At V: ?
At Z: ?

Not helpful yet.

Alternatively, consider triangle WZU. Angles at W, Z, and U. Given ∠WZU = 2x +7 (at Z), and if we can find the other angles.

But where is the angle at U in triangle WZU? It would be ∠ZUW. How is that determined?

Maybe ∠ZUW is part of the angle at U between V and Z. Because ∠VUZ is given as x -8. So if line UZ splits the angle at U into ∠VUZ and ∠ZUW? Wait, unless there's another line. Wait, if we have point V connected to U and Z connected to U, then the total angle at U would be ∠VUZ plus ∠ZUW if those are adjacent. But unless there's a straight line or something else.

Alternatively, if points V and Z are on opposite sides of line U... Hmm. This is unclear without a diagram.

Another approach: look for supplementary angles or linear pairs. For example, if two angles form a straight line, their sum is 180°.

Looking at the angles given:

Suppose at point V, there's an angle ∠UVW (3x-11) and another angle ∠YWV (x+8). Are these adjacent? If so, their sum might be 180°, but that depends on the configuration.

Similarly, at point W, angles ∠WZU (2x+7) and ∠YWV (x+8) could be adjacent? Or maybe ∠UVW and ∠YWV?

Alternatively, think of all angles around a point adding up to 360°, but again, without knowing the configuration, it's tricky.

Wait, maybe there's a quadrilateral formed by points U, V, W, Z, and Y. But with five points, it's more complex.

Alternatively, think of multiple triangles sharing common sides. Let me try to assume that there's a triangle involving points U, V, W, and another triangle involving U, Z, W, etc.

Alternatively, since there are multiple angles involving point Z, maybe focusing on that area.

Let me list all angles given:

1. ∠UVW = 3x -11 (at V)
2. ∠VUZ = x -8 (at U)
3. ∠WZU = 2x +7 (at Z)
4. ∠ZYW = x (at Y)
5. ∠YWV = x +8 (at W)

Now, trying to find relationships between these angles.

Perhaps consider triangle VUZ. Its angles would be at U (∠VUZ = x-8), at V, and at Z. But we don't know the other angles. However, if we can express the third angle in terms of other variables.

Alternatively, think about triangle YZW. At point Y, angle ∠ZYW = x. At point Z, angle ∠WZU = 2x +7. But unless we know another angle in that triangle, not sure.

Wait, maybe consider that points Y, Z, W form a triangle. So in triangle YZW, angles at Y, Z, W. We know angle at Y is x. At Z, it's ∠YZW. Wait, but the given angle at Z is ∠WZU, which is different. Unless ∠YZW is part of ∠WZU? Not sure.

Alternatively, think of lines intersecting. For example, lines VZ and YW intersecting at some point, creating vertical angles. But again, without knowing the exact configuration, it's difficult.

Wait, here's an idea. Maybe all these angles are part of a larger triangle or polygon where the sum of interior angles can be used. For example, if there's a triangle where two angles are expressed in terms of x, allowing us to solve for x.

Alternatively, suppose that points U, V, W, Z, Y form a pentagon, and the sum of its interior angles is (5-2)*180=540°. But we have five angles given, but not sure if they are the interior ones. However, the given angles are individual angles, not necessarily all the interior angles.

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle where the sum of angles equals 180°, combining some of the given expressions.

Let me check if any combination of angles adds up to 180°. For instance, if there's a triangle with angles involving 3x-11, x-8, and 2x+7. Let me try adding them:

(3x -11) + (x -8) + (2x +7) = 6x -12. Setting this equal to 180 gives 6x = 192 → x=32. But then, substituting back, angles would be 3*32-11=85, 32-8=24, 2*32+7=71. Sum is 85+24+71=180. Oh! That works!

Wait, but why would these three angles be part of a triangle? Which triangle? Let me think. The angles (3x-11), (x-8), and (2x+7) would need to be the three angles of a triangle. But which triangle?

Assuming that these three angles are part of triangle UZV? Or another triangle?

Wait, if those three angles are from a triangle, then that would give us an equation to solve for x. Let me proceed with this assumption.

So, if (3x -11) + (x -8) + (2x +7) = 180 → 6x -12 = 180 → 6x = 192 → x = 32.

Then, substitute x=32 into the expressions:

Measure of ∠UVW (3x-11) = 3*32 -11 = 96 -11 = 85°
Measure of ∠VUZ (x-8) = 32 -8 = 24°
Measure of ∠WZU (2x+7) = 2*32 +7 = 64 +7 = 71°

These add up to 85 +24 +71 = 180°, which fits a triangle. Now, which triangle is this? If these three angles are part of triangle UZV, then:

- ∠UVW (at V) is part of triangle UZV? Wait, ∠UVW is at V between U and W. If Z is another point connected to U and V, then triangle UZV would have angles at U, V, and Z. 

But in triangle UZV, the angles would be:

At U: ∠VUZ = x -8 (24°)
At V: ∠UVZ? Wait, but the given angle at V is ∠UVW (3x-11) which is 85°. If that's part of triangle UZV, then ∠UVZ would be 85°, making the third angle at Z: ∠VZU. Wait, but we have ∠WZU = 2x+7 (71°). Is that the same as ∠VZU?

Possibly, if Z is connected to U and W, then ∠WZU is the angle at Z between W and U. If point W is connected to Z, then ∠WZU is part of triangle UZW. But if we considered triangle UZV, then ∠VZU would be the angle at Z between V and U. So unless W and V are aligned in a way that makes ∠WZU the same as ∠VZU, which would require that V and W are the same point, which they aren't. Hence, contradiction. So my initial assumption that those three angles are in the same triangle might be incorrect.

Wait, but even though that leads to inconsistency, mathematically the sum worked. So maybe the triangle isn't UZV, but another triangle. Let me think again.

Suppose the three angles are from triangle UZW. Then:

Angles at U, Z, W.

If ∠WZU (at Z) is 2x+7, and suppose ∠ZUW (at U) is ∠VUZ (x-8)? That would mean that ∠ZUW = x-8, which is part of triangle UZW. Then the third angle at W would be ∠UWZ, which is what we're supposed to find. So if that's the case, then:

Sum of angles in triangle UZW would be:

∠ZUW (x-8) + ∠WZU (2x+7) + ∠UWZ (what we want) = 180°

But then we have two unknowns here: ∠UWZ and x. But we have another angle expression given: ∠YWV = x +8, which is at point W. If ∠YWV is adjacent to ∠UWZ, then together they might form a straight line or another angle.

Wait, if at point W, there are two angles: ∠UWZ (the one we want) and ∠YWV (x+8). If those two angles form a linear pair (i.e., they are supplementary), then their sum would be 180°. Thus:

∠UWZ + ∠YWV = 180°
=> ∠UWZ + (x +8) = 180
=> ∠UWZ = 180 - x -8 = 172 -x

But earlier, in triangle UZW, we had:

(x-8) + (2x+7) + ∠UWZ = 180
=> 3x -1 + ∠UWZ = 180
=> ∠UWZ = 180 -3x +1 = 181 -3x

Setting this equal to the previous expression:

181 -3x = 172 -x
=> 181 -172 = 3x -x
=> 9 = 2x
=> x = 4.5

But then, substituting back into the angles:

∠UVW = 3*(4.5) -11 = 13.5 -11 = 2.5°, which seems very small. Also, ∠VUZ = 4.5 -8 = -3.5°, which is impossible. So this leads to a contradiction. Hence, my assumption that ∠ZUW is x-8 is wrong.

Alternative approach: Maybe the three angles (3x-11, x-8, 2x+7) are from different triangles, but somehow connected via another relation. Let me think again.

Wait, earlier when I added those three angles, I got 6x -12 = 180, leading to x=32. Even though the triangle connection was confusing, maybe there's another relationship. Let's take x=32 and see what happens.

With x=32:

Measure of ∠UVW = 3*32 -11 = 85°
Measure of ∠VUZ = 32 -8 = 24°
Measure of ∠WZU = 2*32 +7 = 71°

Now, if these angles are part of different triangles, maybe there's a way to connect them. For example, ∠VUZ (24°) is at point U, and ∠UVW (85°) is at point V. If lines UV and UZ are connected, then maybe there's a triangle involving U, V, and Z. Let's say triangle UVZ. Then, the angles at U, V, Z would be:

At U: ∠VUZ = 24°
At V: ∠UVZ = ?
At Z: ∠VZU = ?

But we don't have ∠UVZ or ∠VZU. However, if we can relate them to other angles.

Alternatively, if line WV intersects with line ZU at some point, creating vertical angles. But again, without knowing the exact configuration, this is speculative.

Wait, let's consider point W. There's an angle ∠YWV = x+8 = 32+8=40°. And there's another angle involving point W, which is ∠WZU = 71°, which is at point Z. But how are these related?

Alternatively, consider triangle WZU. At point Z, angle is 71°, at point U, angle is ∠ZUW. What is ∠ZUW? It could be related to ∠VUZ (24°) if line ZU is part of the same line as VU, but that might not be the case.

Alternatively, suppose that at point U, the angle between V and Z is 24°, and the angle between Z and another point is something else. Maybe there's another angle at U that combines with 24° to make a larger angle.

Alternatively, if there's a straight line through U, then the sum of angles on that line would be 180°. For example, if line UV and line UZ are on opposite sides, then ∠VUZ (24°) and another angle at U would add to 180°. But unless we have more info, this is guesswork.

Another idea: Since we found x=32 satisfies the sum of the three angles (even though the triangle connection was unclear), maybe that's the correct x, and we can use it to find the measure of ∠W.

Which angle is ∠W? The problem says "m∠W". Assuming it refers to ∠UWZ, which is part of triangle UZW. Earlier, we tried assuming that and got contradictions, but maybe with x=32, we can calculate it.

From earlier, if we consider triangle UZW, with angles at Z (71°), at U (let's call it α), and at W (β).

We have α + β + 71 = 180 => α + β = 109.

But what is α? It's ∠ZUW, which might be related to ∠VUZ (24°). If line ZU is extending from U, and there's another angle at U involving V, then ∠ZUW could be part of that.

Wait, if ∠VUZ is 24°, and if line ZU continues past U, then there might be an angle at U between Z and another line. But without knowing the exact setup, it's hard to say. However, if we assume that ∠ZUW is supplementary to ∠VUZ, then α = 180 - 24 = 156°, but that would make β = 109 - 156 = negative, which is impossible.

Alternatively, if ∠ZUW is the same as ∠VUZ, then α = 24°, leading to β = 109 -24 = 85°. But then, β would be ∠UWZ = 85°, which would be our answer. Let's check if that makes sense.

But where does this 85° come from? If ∠UWZ is 85°, then that's the measure of angle W. Looking at the options, A and B are 38, C is 76, D is 152. 85 isn't listed, but maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, but according to the earlier calculation, if x=32, then ∠UVW = 85°, which would be the angle at V. If that's the case, and if ∠UWZ is also 85°, then that would suggest that maybe there's an isosceles triangle or something else, but without confirmation.

Alternatively, maybe the measure of ∠W is ∠YWV, which is x+8 = 40°, but that's not among the options either. Or maybe another angle.

Wait, the question says "Find m∠W." Depending on which angle at W they refer to. Let me re-examine the given angles:

- ∠YWV = x +8 (at W between Y and V)
- ∠UWZ is another angle at W (between U and Z)
- Possibly ∠VWZ?

Wait, maybe ∠W is referring to ∠YWV, which would be x +8 = 40°, but that's not an option. Or maybe ∠UWZ?

If we go back to the earlier assumption where x=32, and if we consider that in triangle UZW, the angle at W (∠UWZ) is 85°, but that's not an option. However, 85° is close to option C (76) or D (152). Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the three angles summed to 180°. Let me double-check that.

Original assumption: Adding ∠UVW (3x-11), ∠VUZ (x-8), and ∠WZU (2x+7) gave 6x-12=180 → x=32. But why would those three angles be in a triangle? Maybe they are not in the same triangle, but instead form a straight line or something else.

Wait, if those three angles are around a point, their sum would be 360°, but that would give 6x-12=360 → 6x=372 → x=62, which is another possibility. But then substituting x=62:

∠UVW = 3*62 -11 = 186 -11 = 175°, which is possible, but then other angles would be ∠VUZ = 62-8=54°, ∠WZU = 2*62 +7=131°. These three angles sum to 175+54+131=360°, which would fit if they were around a point. But which point? If they are around point U, V, or Z?

This seems too vague. Without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to decide.

Another approach: Let's consider all the given angles and see if they can form equations through other means.

For example, at point Z, we have ∠WZU = 2x +7. Also, there's ∠ZYW = x. If these are angles in a triangle or something. Let's consider triangle ZYW. At point Y, angle is x. At point Z, angle is ∠YZW. Wait, but we have ∠WZU = 2x+7. If points Y and U are connected, then ∠YZW could be part of that. But this is too vague.

Alternatively, think of the entire diagram as having multiple triangles with shared sides, and use the fact that the sum of angles in each triangle is 180°.

Let me try to consider triangle VZW. Angles at V, Z, W.

At V: ∠UVW = 3x-11 (assuming that ∠UVW is part of triangle VZW)
At Z: ∠WZU = 2x+7 (assuming that ∠WZU is part of triangle VZW)
At W: ∠VWZ (unknown)

Sum of angles: (3x-11) + (2x+7) + ∠VWZ = 180
=> 5x -4 + ∠VWZ = 180
=> ∠VWZ = 184 -5x

But ∠VWZ is at point W, which could be related to another angle given. For example, if ∠VWZ is supplementary to ∠YWV (x+8), then:

∠VWZ + ∠YWV = 180
=> (184 -5x) + (x +8) = 180
=> 192 -4x = 180
=> -4x = -12
=> x = 3

Substituting x=3:

Check if this works. Let's compute each angle:

∠UVW = 3*3 -11 = 9-11 = -2° — invalid, as angles can't be negative. So this is impossible. Hence, this assumption is wrong.

Alternative idea: Maybe ∠VWZ is equal to ∠YWV? If they are vertically opposite angles or something. But then:

∠VWZ = ∠YWV = x +8

From above, ∠VWZ = 184 -5x

Thus:

184 -5x = x +8
=> 184 -8 = 6x
=> 176 = 6x
=> x ≈ 29.33...

Not integer, and likely not the intended solution.

Another angle: Maybe the angles at point W. At point W, we have ∠YWV = x+8 and ∠UWZ (the angle we're seeking). If these two angles form a linear pair (i.e., they are adjacent and form a straight line), then:

∠YWV + ∠UWZ = 180
=> x +8 + ∠UWZ = 180
=> ∠UWZ = 172 -x

If we can express ∠UWZ in terms of x from another equation.

Earlier, in triangle UZW, if we assume ∠ZUW = x-8 (from ∠VUZ), then:

∠ZUW + ∠WZU + ∠UWZ = 180
=> (x-8) + (2x+7) + (172 -x) = 180
=> (3x -1) + 172 -x = 180
=> 2x + 171 = 180
=> 2x = 9
=> x = 4.5

Again, leading to negative angle in ∠VUZ (4.5 -8 = -3.5°), which is invalid.

Hmm, this suggests that my assumptions are flawed. Let me revisit the initial assumption where adding the three angles gave x=32. Even though I couldn't link them to a triangle, maybe there's another way. With x=32, let's see:

∠UVW = 85°, ∠VUZ = 24°, ∠WZU = 71°.

If these three angles are part of a triangle, but not the same one. For example, ∠UVW is part of one triangle, ∠VUZ part of another, and ∠WZU part of another. But how?

Alternatively, think of the diagram as having multiple triangles interconnected. For example, if lines VZ and YW intersect at some point, creating vertical angles. But without knowing where they intersect, it's hard to say.

Wait, let's consider that all these angles are part of a single large triangle or quadrilateral, and use the exterior angle theorem.

For example, if ∠UVW is an exterior angle to a triangle, then it equals the sum of the two remote interior angles.

But which triangle? Suppose ∠UVW is an exterior angle to triangle VZU. Then, ∠UVW = ∠VUZ + ∠VZU.

Given ∠UVW = 3x-11, ∠VUZ = x-8, ∠VZU = ? 

If this holds, then:

3x-11 = (x-8) + ∠VZU
=> ∠VZU = 3x-11 -x +8 = 2x -3

But ∠VZU is the angle at Z in triangle VZU. Now, if we can relate ∠VZU to another angle given.

We have ∠WZU = 2x+7. If ∠VZU and ∠WZU are supplementary (since they might be adjacent along a straight line), then:

∠VZU + ∠WZU = 180
=> (2x -3) + (2x +7) = 180
=> 4x +4 = 180
=> 4x = 176
=> x = 44

Now, x=44. Let's check this.

Compute ∠UVW = 3*44 -11 = 132 -11 = 121°
∠VUZ = 44-8 = 36°
∠VZU = 2*44 -3 = 88 -3 = 85°
∠WZU = 2*44 +7 = 88 +7 = 95°

Now, check if ∠VZU + ∠WZU = 85 +95 = 180°, which is true. So this suggests that lines VZ and WZ form a straight line at point Z, making ∠VZU and ∠WZU supplementary. Thus, points V, Z, W are colinear? No, because ∠VZU is at Z between V and U, and ∠WZU is at Z between W and U. If VZ and WZ are on opposite sides of Z, then yes, they'd form a straight line, implying that V, Z, W are colinear. But that would mean that points V, Z, W lie on a straight line, making ∠VZU and ∠WZU supplementary.

If that's the case, then with x=44, we can proceed.

Now, let's find m∠W. Assuming ∠W refers to ∠UWZ, which is at point W between U and Z. To find this, let's consider triangle UZW.

In triangle UZW, we know:

∠WZU = 95° (from above)
∠ZUW = ? 
∠UWZ = ?

To find ∠ZUW, we can look at point U. At point U, we have ∠VUZ = 36° (from earlier). If line UZ is part of the straight line V-Z-W, then ∠ZUW would be part of another angle at U.

Wait, if V, Z, W are colinear, then at point U, the angle between V and Z is ∠VUZ = 36°, and the angle between Z and W would depend on other connections. But without knowing more, it's hard to say.

However, if we consider triangle UZW, we need two angles to find the third. We know ∠WZU = 95°. What about ∠ZUW?

If ∠ZUW is part of the angle at U, which includes ∠VUZ = 36°. If there's another angle at U, like ∠ZUW, then depending on how the lines are arranged, ∠ZUW could be related to other angles.

Alternatively, if we consider that at point U, the angles around it sum to 360° if there are multiple lines. But without knowing, this is speculative.

Wait, but if V, Z, W are colinear, then at point U, the line UZ forms an angle with UV (∠VUZ = 36°) and with UW. If line UW is connected to U, then the angle between UZ and UW would be ∠ZUW. But unless there's more information, we cannot determine this angle.

However, we might have another angle at U from the given data. Wait, there's no other angle at U given except ∠VUZ = x-8 = 36°. If that's the only angle at U, then ∠ZUW would be the same as ∠VUZ? No, unless line UW is the same as line UV, which it's not.

This is getting too tangled. Let me try to focus on finding ∠UWZ (m∠W) using the current x=44.

In triangle UZW, we have ∠WZU = 95°, and we need to find ∠UWZ. To do this, we need another angle in the triangle. Let's assume that ∠ZUW is known or can be derived.

If we can find ∠ZUW, then we can use the triangle angle sum.

How to find ∠ZUW? It's the angle at U between Z and W. If we can relate this to other angles.

At point U, we have ∠VUZ = 36°, which is the angle between V and Z. If line UW is connected to U, then ∠ZUW is the angle between Z and W at U. If there's a line connecting U to W, then ∠ZUW would be part of another triangle or something.

But without more information, it's still unclear. However, if we consider that line UW is connected to point W, and there's another angle at W involving Y. Given that ∠YWV = x +8 = 44 +8 = 52°, which is at W between Y and V. If this angle is part of a triangle with ∠UWZ, then maybe they are supplementary.

Assume that ∠UWZ and ∠YWV are supplementary (forming a straight line):

∠UWZ + ∠YWV = 180°
=> ∠UWZ + 52 = 180
=> ∠UWZ = 128°

Now, in triangle UZW, we have ∠WZU = 95°, ∠UWZ = 128°, so the remaining angle ∠ZUW would be 180 -95 -128 = -43°, which is impossible. Hence, contradiction.

Therefore, this assumption is incorrect.

Another idea: Maybe ∠ZUW is equal to ∠YWV = 52°. Then:

In triangle UZW:

∠ZUW = 52°
∠WZU = 95°
∠UWZ = 180 -52 -95 = 33°

But 33° is not one of the options either. Hmm.

Alternatively, if ∠ZUW is related to another angle. For example, if there's a triangle involving point Y and U.

Given ∠ZYW = x = 44°. At point Y, angle ∠ZYW = 44°. If we can relate this to other angles.

This is getting too convoluted. Maybe there's another way. Since we've already found x=32 and x=44 from different approaches, but neither led to a valid answer, perhaps I missed a key relationship.

Let me go back to the first approach where x=32, leading to ∠UVW=85°, ∠VUZ=24°, ∠WZU=71°, summing to 180°. Even though I couldn't map these to a single triangle, maybe they are part of different triangles that share a common side or angle.

For example, suppose ∠UVW=85° is part of triangle UVW, ∠VUZ=24° is part of triangle VUZ, and ∠WZU=71° is part of triangle WZU. Let's explore this.

Starting with triangle VUZ: angles at U (24°), at V, and at Z. Let's call the angle at V as a and at Z as b. So:

24 + a + b = 180 ⇒ a + b = 156°.

Now, consider triangle WZU: angles at Z (71°), at U (let's call it c), and at W (d). So:

71 + c + d = 180 ⇒ c + d = 109°.

Now, if we can relate a and c, or b and d.

If points V, Z, and W are collinear, then at point Z, the angles a and b would be supplementary with ∠WZU=71°. Wait, if V, Z, W are collinear, then at point Z, the angle between VZ and WZ would be 180°, but ∠WZU is part of that. This is getting too vague.

Alternatively, if line VZ is extended to meet line WU at some point, creating other angles. This is too open-ended.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should try plugging x=32 and x=44 into the options.

If x=32, and assuming that m∠W is ∠UWZ, which from earlier attempts, if we assumed it was 85°, which is not an option. But the closest option is C (76) or D (152). Alternatively, if there's another angle.

Wait, ∠WZU is 71° when x=32. Maybe the question refers to this angle? But it's called ∠WZU, not ∠W.

Alternatively, if the measure of ∠W is ∠YWV = x+8 = 32 +8 = 40°, which is not an option. Or maybe ∠VWZ = 184 -5x from earlier, with x=32: 184 - 160 = 24°, not matching.

If x=44, then ∠YWV = 52°, ∠UVW=121°, ∠VUZ=36°, ∠WZU=95°. Still no match.

Wait, let me think differently. Perhaps all these angles are part of a pentagon, and the sum of the interior angles is 540°. Let's see:

Sum of all given angles: (3x-11) + (x-8) + (2x+7) + x + (x+8) = 3x-11 + x-8 + 2x+7 +x +x+8 = 3x +x +2x +x +x -11 -8 +7 +8 = 8x -4. Set this equal to 540:

8x -4 = 540 → 8x = 544 → x = 68.

Then, check if this makes sense. For example, ∠UVW = 3*68 -11 = 204 -11 = 193°, which is impossible as an interior angle of a pentagon. Hence, this approach is invalid.

I'm running out of ideas. Let me reconsider the initial assumption where x=32, even though I couldn't map it to a triangle. If x=32, and assuming that the measure of ∠W is ∠UWZ, which we previously thought might be 85°, but since that's not an option, perhaps there's another angle.

Wait, what if ∠W refers to ∠VWZ? Let's calculate it. From earlier, in triangle VZW, we had:

∠UVW = 3x-11, ∠WZU = 2x+7, and ∠VWZ = 184 -5x (from earlier). With x=32, ∠VWZ = 184 - 160 = 24°, which is not an option.

Alternatively, if there's another triangle where ∠W is part of. Let me think about triangle YWV. At point W, we have ∠YWV = x+8 = 40°. If this is part of a triangle with other angles, but without more info, it's hard to say.

Wait, let me recall that the answer choices are A. 38, B. 38, C. 76, D. 152. Notice that options A and B are the same. Maybe it's a typo, but assuming it's a mistake, let's proceed.

If x=32, and if there's an angle of 38°, how can that happen? Let's see: 3x-11 = 3*32-11=85, x-8=24, 2x+7=71, x=32, x+8=40. None of these are 38. If x=38, let's see:

If x=38, then ∠UVW=3*38-11=114-11=103°, ∠VUZ=38-8=30°, ∠WZU=2*38+7=83°, ∠ZYW=38°, ∠YWV=38+8=46°. Still no 38° unless it's one of the angles.

Wait, if x=38, then ∠ZYW=x=38°, which is option A. But the question asks for m∠W. If ∠W refers to ∠ZYW, then it would be 38°, which is option A. But why would ∠W refer to ∠ZYW? That would mean the angle at Y, which is not typically denoted as ∠W. This is confusing.

Alternatively, if the question has a typo and meant ∠Y, but the user wrote ∠W. Or maybe the diagram shows ∠W as ∠ZYW. Without the diagram, it's ambiguous.

But given the answer choices include 38, and if x=32 leads to no match, but x=38 gives ∠ZYW=38°, which is option A, maybe this is the intended solution. How?

Let me try setting ∠ZYW = x = 38°, so x=38. Let's see if this leads to consistent results.

With x=38:

∠UVW = 3*38 -11 = 114-11=103°
∠VUZ = 38-8=30°
∠WZU = 2*38 +7=83°
∠ZYW = 38°
∠YWV = 38+8=46°

Now, let's check if these angles can form consistent triangles or relationships.

Consider triangle VUZ: angles at U (30°), at V, and at Z. Let's call the angle at V as a and at Z as b. So 30 + a + b = 180 → a + b = 150°.

Now, consider triangle WZU: angles at Z (83°), at U (let's call it c), and at W (d). So 83 + c + d = 180 → c + d = 97°.

If we can relate c and a, or d and
