<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out the area of this trapezoid. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the shape we're dealing with. 

So, there are points A, B, C, D. The lines are AB, BC, CD, DA. That forms a quadrilateral ABCD. Also, it's mentioned that it's a trapezoid. Wait, but trapezoids have at least one pair of parallel sides. But the problem says it's a trapezoid, so maybe we need to confirm that. However, the given predicates also mention some right angles. Let me check those.

Right angles at Angle(B,D,A) and Angle(A,D,B). So, angle at point D between points B, D, A is a right angle. Similarly, angle at D between A, D, B is also a right angle. Wait, that seems like two right angles at D? Or maybe they are referring to different angles. Wait, the first one is Angle(B,D,A), which would be the angle at D between BD and DA. The second is Angle(A,D,B), which is the angle at D between AD and DB. Wait, but if both angles are at D, then those two angles would form a straight line? Because if you have two adjacent angles at D, adding up to 180 degrees. But since both are right angles (each 90 degrees), that would mean that the sum is 180 degrees, making BD perpendicular to DA and also perpendicular to DB? That doesn't make sense unless BD is zero length, which isn't possible. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the angles. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the angles are not both at D. Let me re-examine the predicates. The first is RightAngle(Angle(B,D,A)). The angle here has vertex at D, because the middle letter is D. So that's angle at D formed by points B-D-A. Similarly, the second is RightAngle(Angle(A,D,B)), which is angle at D formed by points A-D-B. Wait, that's the same angle? No, wait. Wait, the angle A-D-B would be the same as angle B-D-A? Or maybe not. Wait, angle ADB is the same as angle BDA. So if both angles are right angles, then that implies that the lines DA and DB are each perpendicular to BD? Which would imply that DA and DB are both perpendicular to BD, meaning DA and DB are colinear? But that would make points A and B lie on the same line through D, but since DA and DB are connected to D, maybe that's forming a rectangle? Hmm, perhaps I need to sketch this mentally.

Alternatively, maybe the trapezoid is actually a rectangle? But the given side lengths don't match. Wait, the given lengths are: Length of AD is 15, Length of BD is 10, and Length of AC is 14. Wait, hold on. Wait, the problem states Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,D)),15) – so AD = 15 units. Then Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,D)),10) – BD = 10 units. And Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C)),14) – AC = 14 units. 

Also, the angles at D are right angles. So, angle at D between B-D-A and angle at D between A-D-B. Wait, but these are two angles at D. Wait, if angle BDA is a right angle and angle ADB is another right angle, but that's the same angle? Or maybe the angles are different. Maybe there's confusion here. Let me clarify:

In standard notation, Angle(B,D,A) means the angle at point D between points B, D, A. So that's angle BDA. Similarly, Angle(A,D,B) would be the angle at D between points A, D, B. Wait, that's the same angle! So both predicates are stating that angle BDA is a right angle. So that would mean that angle at D is 90 degrees. But then how does that fit with the rest?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. Suppose we have points A, B, C, D arranged such that AB, BC, CD, DA are the sides. So quadrilateral ABCD. Now, the angles at D: angle ADC and angle ADB? Wait, perhaps the problem refers to two different angles. Alternatively, maybe the trapezoid has two right angles at D. For example, if sides AD and DC are perpendicular to each other, and sides DA and AB are also perpendicular? But that would require more structure.

Alternatively, maybe the trapezoid is a right trapezoid with two right angles at D. For instance, if sides AD and DC are perpendicular (so angle at D between AD and DC is right), and sides DA and AB are perpendicular (angle at D between DA and AB is right)? Wait, but that would imply that AB is parallel to DC, making it a right trapezoid. But then, how do the given lengths come into play?

But the problem mentions that the angles at D are right angles. Let me focus on the given data:

We have quadrilateral ABCD with AB, BC, CD, DA as sides. Angles at D: Angle(B,D,A) and Angle(A,D,B) are right angles. Wait, but that's the same angle. Unless there's a typo, but assuming the problem is correctly stated, maybe there's a misunderstanding. Let me think again about the angle notations.

Another possibility: Perhaps Angle(B,D,A) refers to the angle at D between segments BD and DA, while Angle(A,D,B) refers to the angle at D between segments AD and DB. Wait, but those are the same angle. Therefore, having both right angles suggests that angle at D is 90 degrees. But then, how does that affect the rest of the figure?

Alternatively, maybe the problem meant two different angles. For example, Angle(B,D,A) could be angle at D between BD and DA, and Angle(A,D,B) could be angle at D between AD and DB, but that's the same angle. This seems conflicting. Maybe the problem intended to say that angles at D and another point are right angles. Alternatively, perhaps there was a mix-up in the angle labels.

Alternatively, perhaps the trapezoid has right angles at D and another point. Wait, but the given angles are only at D. Let me consider that maybe the trapezoid has right angles at D and B, but that's just speculation. Alternatively, maybe the trapezoid is a rectangle, but the given lengths contradict that.

Let me try to visualize the quadrilateral. Since there are four points connected as AB, BC, CD, DA. Given that angles at D are right angles. Let me assume that angle ADC and angle DAB are right angles. Wait, but that's not directly given. Wait, the given angles are at D. So, angle between BD and DA is right, and angle between AD and DB is right. Which again seems redundant. 

Wait, perhaps the problem meant that angles at D and another point are right angles. Let me look back. The given predicates are:

RightAngle(Angle(B,D,A)) → angle at D between B-D-A.

RightAngle(Angle(A,D,B)) → angle at D between A-D-B.

These are the same angle. So, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe the angles are at different vertices. Wait, maybe Angle(A,D,B) is supposed to be at point B? But the notation is Angle(X,Y,Z), where Y is the vertex. So, Angle(A,D,B) would be the angle at D between A and B. Wait, that's the same as before. So, it's the same angle. Hence, both statements are saying that angle at D is 90 degrees. 

Assuming that, then the quadrilateral ABCD has a right angle at D. Additionally, it's a trapezoid. So, a trapezoid with one right angle at D. But trapezoid requires at least one pair of parallel sides. Let me think. If angle at D is right, then sides AD and DC are perpendicular (since angle ADC is part of the trapezoid?), but without knowing which sides are parallel, it's hard to tell. 

Wait, maybe the trapezoid has sides AD and BC being parallel? Or AB and DC being parallel? Let me consider the given lengths. We know AD=15, BD=10, AC=14. Wait, BD is a diagonal? Wait, BD connects points B and D. So, BD is a diagonal of the quadrilateral. 

Given that, maybe we can use coordinates to model this. Let me assign coordinates to the points. Let's place point D at the origin (0,0) since there are right angles at D. Let me assume that AD is along the x-axis and DC is along the y-axis. Since angle at D is 90 degrees, so AD ⊥ DC. 

So, point D is at (0,0). Let me define point A somewhere on the x-axis. Since AD = 15, then point A would be at (15, 0). Then, since DC is perpendicular to AD, DC is vertical. Let me denote point C as (0, c) for some c. But wait, the length DC is not given. Also, BD is given as 10. Point B is connected to D via BD, which has length 10. But where is point B located? 

Since angle at D is between AD and DC, but also there's a diagonal BD. Let me think. Since angle at D is 90 degrees, and BD is a diagonal. Let me suppose that BD is from D(0,0) to B(x,y), such that the distance from D to B is 10. Also, since angle at D is between AD (which goes from D(0,0) to A(15,0)) and DC (from D(0,0) to C(0,c)). Therefore, BD is a diagonal connecting D(0,0) to B(x,y). But how does this relate to the rest of the figure?

Additionally, we have the line BC and line CD. So, point C is connected to B, and point D is connected to C. Also, the line AB connects A(15,0) to B(x,y). 

Moreover, the length of AC is given as 14. Point A is at (15,0), point C is at (0,c). So, the distance between A and C is sqrt((15-0)^2 + (0 - c)^2) = sqrt(225 + c²) = 14. Therefore:

sqrt(225 + c²) = 14  
Square both sides: 225 + c² = 196  
c² = 196 - 225 = -29  

Wait, that can't be possible. Negative value under square root. That suggests an inconsistency. Which means my assumption about the placement of points might be wrong. 

Hmm. Where did I go wrong? Let me check. If I placed point D at (0,0), point A at (15,0), and point C at (0,c), then AC is the distance between (15,0) and (0,c), which gives sqrt(15² + c²) = 14. Solving gives c² = 14² - 15² = negative. That's impossible. Therefore, my initial coordinate setup is flawed. 

Maybe my assumption that AD and DC are axes is incorrect. Perhaps the right angles are not between AD and DC, but between other sides. Let me reconsider. 

The given angles are at D: angle between BD and DA is right, and angle between AD and DB is right. Wait, but that's the same angle. So, BD is perpendicular to DA. So, BD is perpendicular to DA. Therefore, BD is perpendicular to DA, meaning that BD is vertical if DA is horizontal. 

Let me try placing point D at (0,0). Let me set DA along the x-axis, so point A is at (a, 0). Then, BD is perpendicular to DA, so BD is vertical. So, point B lies somewhere along the line perpendicular to DA at D. Since DA is along x-axis, BD is vertical line through D(0,0). Therefore, point B has coordinates (0, b) for some b. 

Now, given that BD = 10. The distance between B(0,b) and D(0,0) is |b| = 10, so b = 10 or -10. Let's take b = 10, so B is at (0,10).

Point A is at (a, 0), and DA length is 15, so distance from D(0,0) to A(a,0) is |a| = 15 → a = 15 or -15. Let's take a = 15, so A is at (15, 0).

Now, the quadrilateral is ABCD. Points are A(15,0), B(0,10), C(?), D(0,0). Need to find coordinates of C. 

We also have that AC = 14. Point C is connected to D(0,0) via line CD, and to B(0,10) via line BC. Also, the quadrilateral is ABCD, so the order is A-B-C-D-A.

So, the line BC connects B(0,10) to C(x,y), and line CD connects C(x,y) to D(0,0). Also, line DA connects D(0,0) to A(15,0). 

We need to find coordinates of C such that AC = 14. Let me express point C as (x,y). Then, AC is the distance between A(15,0) and C(x,y): sqrt[(x -15)^2 + (y - 0)^2] = 14 → (x-15)^2 + y^2 = 196.

Additionally, since line CD connects C(x,y) to D(0,0), and line BC connects C(x,y) to B(0,10). Also, since the quadrilateral is closed, we need to ensure that the connections are correct. 

But how to find x and y? Also, we need to consider that the shape is a trapezoid. Trapezoid requires that one pair of sides is parallel. In our case, which sides could be parallel? 

Possibly AB || CD or AD || BC. Let me check. 

First, AB is from A(15,0) to B(0,10). Its slope is (10 - 0)/(0 -15) = 10 / (-15) = -2/3. 

CD is from C(x,y) to D(0,0). Slope of CD is (0 - y)/(0 - x) = y/x. 

For AB || CD, slopes should be equal: -2/3 = y/x → y = (-2/3)x.

Alternatively, AD is from A(15,0) to D(0,0), which is horizontal line (slope 0). So if AD is parallel to BC, then BC should also be horizontal. But BC connects B(0,10) to C(x,y). For BC to be horizontal, y-coordinate of C must be 10. So y = 10. 

But then, if y=10, then AC distance is sqrt[(x-15)^2 + (10)^2] = 14 → (x-15)^2 + 100 = 196 → (x-15)^2 = 96 → x = 15 ± √96. 

But then, what about the line CD? From C(x,10) to D(0,0). The slope would be (0-10)/(0-x) = 10/x. 

But if AD is parallel to BC (AD is horizontal), then BC is horizontal, which would make AD || BC, hence making it a trapezoid. 

However, we also have that the angle at D is right angle between BD and DA. Since DA is horizontal, BD is vertical (as previously set), which satisfies the right angle condition. 

So, this scenario seems plausible. Let me proceed with this assumption. 

So, assuming AD || BC (horizontal), then BC is horizontal, so y=10. Then, point C is (x,10). Then, AC distance equation:

(x-15)^2 + (10)^2 = 196 → (x-15)^2 = 96 → x = 15 ± √96. Simplify √96: √(16*6)=4√6 ≈ 9.798. So x ≈ 15 ± 9.798. Thus, x ≈ 24.798 or x ≈ 5.202. 

But we need to ensure that the quadrilateral is closed properly. Since the points are A(15,0), B(0,10), C(x,10), D(0,0). Connecting them in order: AB, BC, CD, DA. 

Now, what about line CD? It connects C(x,10) to D(0,0). Also, line BC connects B(0,10) to C(x,10). So, BC is horizontal. 

Now, the trapezoid has bases AD and BC. AD has length 15, BC has length from (0,10) to (x,10), which is |x - 0| = |x|. So length BC = |x|. 

To compute the area of the trapezoid, the formula is (base1 + base2)/2 * height. Here, the bases are AD (15) and BC (|x|), and the height is the vertical distance between the two bases. Since AD is horizontal and BC is horizontal, the vertical distance between them is the vertical difference. Wait, but AD is along y=0, and BC is along y=10. So the height is 10. 

Therefore, area would be (15 + |x|)/2 * 10. 

But we need to find |x|. From earlier, x = 15 ± 4√6. So |x| depends on the sign. 

But let's think about the position of point C. Since the quadrilateral is connected as A-B-C-D-A. After point C, we connect to D(0,0). So point C must be positioned such that the line CD connects to D. If x is positive, then point C is to the right of D. If x is negative, to the left. 

But considering the order of the quadrilateral, if moving from B(0,10) to C(x,10), then to D(0,0), then to A(15,0). For the quadrilateral to close properly, the direction matters. Let's assume that x is positive, so that point C is to the right of D. Thus, x = 15 + 4√6 or x = 15 - 4√6. Wait, but if x were 15 + 4√6, then point C would be far to the right. But then line CD would go from (x,10) to (0,0). 

But we need to verify consistency. Let me calculate x. Let's take x = 15 - 4√6. Let's see why. If x were larger than 15, then the length BC would be longer, but maybe that's acceptable. However, the problem didn't specify whether the trapezoid is convex or not. 

But regardless, the area expression is ((15 + |x|)/2)*10. To find |x|, we can note that x can be either 15 + 4√6 or 15 - 4√6. Let's check if both are valid. 

Take x = 15 - 4√6. Since 4√6 ≈ 9.798, then x ≈ 15 - 9.798 ≈ 5.202, which is positive. So |x| = x ≈ 5.202. 

Alternatively, if x = 15 + 4√6, then |x| = x ≈ 15 + 9.798 ≈ 24.798. Both possibilities exist. How do we decide which one is correct? 

Looking back at the original problem, the diagonals may provide more info. Wait, we have the diagonal AC = 14, which we already used. Are there any other constraints? 

Wait, the quadrilateral is ABCD. So, after defining points A(15,0), B(0,10), C(x,10), D(0,0), we need to check if the line CD connects to D and the line BC connects to C. 

But perhaps there's another constraint from the fact that the quadrilateral is a trapezoid. Also, since we have the right angles at D, but in this configuration, we already satisfied that. 

But we need to make sure that the entire figure is a trapezoid. Since we assumed AD || BC, which makes it a trapezoid. 

So, proceeding with that, the area is ((15 + |x|)/2) * 10. 

But we need to find |x|. From earlier, we had (x - 15)^2 + 10^2 = 14^2 → (x - 15)^2 = 196 - 100 = 96 → x - 15 = ±√96 → x = 15 ± √96. 

Thus, |x| = |15 ± √96|. Depending on the sign. However, since x is the x-coordinate of point C, and assuming the trapezoid is drawn in a way that point C is to the right of D(0,0), then x could be positive. Let's take x = 15 - √96. Wait, but √96 is approx 9.798, so 15 - 9.798 ≈ 5.2, which is positive. 

So, substituting into the area formula: ((15 + |x|)/2)*10. 

Here, |x| = 15 - √96? Wait, no. Wait, x = 15 ± √96. So if x = 15 - √96, then |x| = 15 - √96, since it's positive. But if x = 15 + √96, then |x| = 15 + √96. 

But we need to determine which value of x is correct. 

Let me consider the shape of the trapezoid. Since we have points A(15,0), B(0,10), C(x,10), D(0,0). If x is 15 - √96, then point C is at (≈5.2, 10). Connecting these points, the trapezoid would have AD (from (0,0) to (15,0)), BC (from (0,10) to (≈5.2,10)), CD (from (≈5.2,10) to (0,0)), and DA (closing the shape). 

Alternatively, if x = 15 + √96 ≈ 24.8, then point C is further to the right, leading to a wider base BC. 

But how to determine which one is correct? Let's think about the position of point C relative to the other points. 

In the trapezoid, after connecting B(0,10) to C(x,10), then to D(0,0). If x is larger than 15, then the line CD would extend from (x,10) to (0,0), crossing over point A(15,0). However, since the trapezoid is defined as ABCD, the order of the points is important. 

If we take x = 15 + √96, then point C would be to the right of A(15,0). But then the line CD would go from C(x,10) to D(0,0), passing near A. However, this might not conflict with anything. 

Alternatively, taking x = 15 - √96, which is less than 15, meaning point C is between D and A horizontally. 

Either case seems possible. However, we need to find the area. Let's compute both cases. 

Case 1: x = 15 + √96 → |x| = 15 + √96. Area = [(15 + (15 + √96))/2] * 10 = [30 + √96]/2 * 10 = (15 + (√96)/2) * 10. 

Case 2: x = 15 - √96 → |x| = 15 - √96. Area = [(15 + (15 - √96))/2] * 10 = (30 - √96)/2 * 10 = (15 - (√96)/2) * 10. 

But neither of these seem to simplify easily. However, perhaps there's another relationship we haven't considered. 

Wait, we also have line BC and line CD. Since we've defined point C as (x,10), line BC is from (0,10) to (x,10), which is horizontal. Line CD is from (x,10) to (0,0). 

Is there any other constraint? For example, the length of BC? Not given directly. However, the trapezoid might have other properties. 

Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that ABCD is a trapezoid, so the non-parallel sides are AB and CD. But since we already fixed AD || BC, the other sides are AB and CD. 

But without more information, it's challenging to determine x. However, the problem provides the length of AC as 14, which we already used. 

Wait, but maybe there's a way to find |x| using other relations. Let me think. 

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the coordinates of point C and use the fact that line CD connects to D(0,0) and line BC connects to B(0,10). But I don't see a direct relation unless we consider other lengths. 

Wait, but we have all the given lengths except for BC and CD. However, the problem doesn't give us those. So, perhaps there's another approach. 

Let me recall that in a trapezoid with bases AD and BC, and height h, the area is (AD + BC)/2 * h. In our case, h is the vertical distance between AD (at y=0) and BC (at y=10), so h=10. So area = (AD + BC)/2 * 10. AD is 15, so if we can find BC, we can compute the area. 

BC is the length from B(0,10) to C(x,10), which is |x - 0| = |x|. So BC = |x|. 

From earlier, we found that x = 15 ± √96. So BC = |x| = 15 ± √96. But we need to choose the correct sign. 

Wait, but if we consider the trapezoid, the sides AB and CD are the legs. In this case, AB is from A(15,0) to B(0,10), which has length sqrt((15)^2 + (10)^2) = sqrt(225 + 100) = sqrt(325) = 5√13. CD is from C(x,10) to D(0,0), which has length sqrt(x² + 10²). 

But the problem doesn't provide the lengths of AB or CD, so this might not help. 

Wait, but maybe there's another way to compute the area using coordinates. Once we have coordinates for all points, we can use the shoelace formula. 

Shoelace formula for quadrilateral ABCD: 

Area = ½ |sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i)| 

Points in order: A(15,0), B(0,10), C(x,10), D(0,0), back to A(15,0).

Compute terms:

x_A y_B - x_B y_A = 15*10 - 0*0 = 150  
x_B y_C - x_C y_B = 0*10 - x*10 = -10x  
x_C y_D - x_D y_C = x*0 - 0*10 = 0  
x_D y_A - x_A y_D = 0*0 - 15*0 = 0  

Summing these: 150 -10x + 0 + 0 = 150 -10x  
Absolute value divided by 2: |150 -10x| / 2 = |75 -5x|

So the area is |75 -5x|. 

But we also have another expression for the area as (AD + BC)/2 * height = (15 + |x|)/2 * 10. 

Setting them equal: 

|75 -5x| = (15 + |x|)/2 * 10 → |75 -5x| = 5*(15 + |x|)

Let me drop the absolute value by considering cases. 

Case 1: Assume x ≥ 0. Since we are in the case where BC is horizontal at y=10, and x is positive. 

Then, |x| = x. Also, depending on the value of x, 75 -5x could be positive or negative. 

Subcase 1a: 75 -5x ≥ 0 → x ≤ 15. 

Then, equation becomes 75 -5x = 5*(15 + x)  
75 -5x = 75 +5x  
Subtract 75: -5x = 5x → -10x = 0 → x = 0. 

But x=0 would put point C at (0,10), which coincides with point B(0,10). That's invalid. So reject this subcase. 

Subcase 1b: 75 -5x < 0 → x > 15. 

Equation becomes -(75 -5x) = 5*(15 + x)  
→ -75 +5x = 75 +5x  
Subtract 5x: -75 = 75 → Contradiction. So no solution in this case. 

Hmm, that suggests no solution under Case 1. What about Case 2: x < 0. 

Then, |x| = -x. 

Also, evaluate 75 -5x. Since x is negative, -5x is positive, so 75 -5x is definitely positive. 

So equation becomes 75 -5x = 5*(15 + (-x)) → 75 -5x = 75 -5x → identity. 

This holds true for any x < 0. 

But earlier, from the AC distance, we had x = 15 ± √96. Since √96 ≈ 9.798, then x = 15 - √96 ≈ 5.202, which is positive, and x = 15 + √96 ≈ 24.798, also positive. Neither of these satisfy x < 0. 

This suggests that our assumption that AD || BC leads to contradictions. Therefore, there must be an error in the assumption. 

Alternative approach: Perhaps the trapezoid has AD and BC not parallel, but instead AB and CD parallel? Let me try that. 

If AB is parallel to CD, then their slopes must be equal. 

Earlier, slope of AB was -2/3. 

Slope of CD: from C(x,y) to D(0,0) is (0 - y)/(0 - x) = y/x. 

Setting equal to -2/3: y/x = -2/3 → y = (-2/3)x. 

So point C lies on the line y = (-2/3)x. 

Also, AC has length 14. Point A is at (15,0), point C is at (x, y) = (x, -2x/3). 

Distance AC: sqrt[(x - 15)^2 + (-2x/3 - 0)^2] = sqrt[(x-15)^2 + (4x²)/9] = 14. 

Square both sides: (x-15)^2 + (4x²)/9 = 196. 

Expand (x-15)^2: x² -30x + 225. 

So total equation: x² -30x +225 + (4x²)/9 = 196. 

Multiply all terms by 9 to eliminate denominator: 9x² - 270x + 2025 + 4x² = 1764. 

Combine terms: 13x² -270x + 2025 - 1764 = 0 → 13x² -270x + 261 = 0. 

Solve quadratic equation: 13x² -270x + 261 = 0. 

Discriminant D = (270)^2 - 4*13*261. 

Calculate D: 72900 - 4*13*261. 

First, compute 4*13 = 52. 52*261 = ?

Let me calculate 261*50 = 13050, 261*2 = 522 → total 13050 + 522 = 13572. 

Thus, D = 72900 - 13572 = 59328. 

Now, sqrt(59328). Let me see: 59328 ÷ 16 = 3708. So sqrt(59328) = 4*sqrt(3708). Not helpful. Maybe factor 59328: 

Divide by 4: 59328 / 4 = 14832. Again divide by 4: 14832 /4 = 3708. Divide by 4 again: 3708/4 = 927. So sqrt(59328) = 4*4*sqrt(927) = 16*sqrt(927). Still messy. 

Not promising. This suggests that solving for x is complicated, and perhaps there's a mistake in this approach. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a better way using the given right angles. 

Recall that there are two right angles at D. Earlier, we thought that it was the same angle, but perhaps it's two different angles. Wait, maybe the trapezoid has two right angles at D, implying that AD and DC are perpendicular, and also DA and DB are perpendicular. Wait, but DA is a side, and DB is a diagonal. 

Wait, if DA is perpendicular to DB, and DA is also perpendicular to DC, then DB and DC are collinear? Because if both DB and DC are perpendicular to DA, then they must be in the same line. So, points B and C would lie on the same line perpendicular to DA at D. 

But in that case, points B and C are on the same line through D, which is perpendicular to DA. Let me try this. 

Let me place D at (0,0), DA along x-axis, so A at (15,0). DA is horizontal. Then, DB and DC are both vertical (perpendicular to DA). So, point B is at (0, b) and point C is at (0, c). 

But then, the quadrilateral would have points A(15,0), B(0,b), C(0,c), D(0,0). Connecting AB, BC, CD, DA. 

Now, the line BC connects B(0,b) to C(0,c), which is vertical line x=0. Line CD connects C(0,c) to D(0,0), which is the same line as BC. So, this degenerates into a line segment, making the quadrilateral collapse. Not possible. Hence, this suggests contradiction. 

Therefore, my previous assumptions about the angles are likely incorrect. 

Perhaps the problem has a typo, and the right angles are at different vertices. For example, maybe Angle(B,D,A) and Angle(A,D,B) are at points B and A respectively. But the notation specifies Angle(X,Y,Z) with Y as the vertex. So Angle(B,D,A) has vertex at D. 

This is getting too confusing. Let me try to revisit the initial data. 

Given that the quadrilateral is a trapezoid, and has right angles at D. Let me try to think differently. 

Suppose the trapezoid has AD and BC as the two parallel sides, with AD perpendicular to AB and DC. So, it's a right trapezoid with right angles at A and D. Wait, but the given angles are at D. 

Alternatively, suppose that the trapezoid has one right angle at D, and another right angle at A. But the given angles are only at D. 

Wait, the problem says "trapezoid", so it must have at least one pair of parallel sides. Let me try to use the given lengths and the right angles to find the area. 

We know AD = 15, BD = 10, AC = 14, and two right angles at D. 

Let me consider triangle ABD. Since angle at D is right, triangle ABD is right-angled at D. So, AD = 15, BD = 10, so AB can be computed via Pythagoras: AB = sqrt(AD² + BD²) = sqrt(225 + 100) = sqrt(325) = 5√13. 

Now, AC = 14. Point C is part of the trapezoid. Let me think about how AC relates to other parts. 

If the trapezoid has AD || BC, then AC is a diagonal. In this case, maybe we can use the formula for the area of a trapezoid with given diagonals and other elements. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, since we have AC = 14, and we know AD = 15, BD = 10, perhaps we can use coordinates again. 

Let me try placing D at (0,0), A at (15,0), B at (0,10) (since angle at D is right, and BD=10). Now, we need to find point C such that AC = 14 and the quadrilateral is a trapezoid. 

Assume that AD is parallel to BC. As before, AD is horizontal. So BC must also be horizontal. Hence, point C has the same y-coordinate as B, which is 10. So C is at (x, 10). 

Then, AC is the distance from A(15,0) to C(x,10): sqrt((x-15)^2 + (10)^2) = 14 → (x-15)^2 + 100 = 196 → (x-15)^2 = 96 → x = 15 ± √96. 

So, point C is at (15 ± √96, 10). 

Now, the trapezoid has bases AD (15) and BC (length |x - 0| = |x|). Height is the vertical distance between the bases, which is 10 (since AD is at y=0 and BC is at y=10). 

Thus, area = (15 + |x|)/2 * 10. 

Now, let's substitute x = 15 ± √96. 

If x = 15 + √96, then |x| = 15 + √96. Area = (15 + 15 + √96)/2 * 10 = (30 + √96)/2 * 10 = (15 + (√96)/2) * 10. 

If x = 15 - √96, then |x| = 15 - √96 (since √96 ≈ 9.798 < 15). So area = (15 + 15 - √96)/2 * 10 = (30 - √96)/2 * 10 = (15 - (√96)/2) * 10. 

Now, let's compute these values numerically. 

√96 = √(16*6) = 4√6 ≈ 4*2.449 ≈ 9.796. 

First case: 15 + 9.796 = 24.796. Area = 24.796/2 * 10 = 12.398 * 10 = 123.98. Close to 124. 

Second case: 15 - 9.796 = 5.204. Area = 5.204/2 * 10 = 2.602 * 10 = 26.02. 

Neither of these match the answer choices (45, 90, 180, 360). Hmm. This suggests that there's an error in my assumptions. 

Wait, but perhaps the trapezoid is not having AD || BC, but instead AB || CD? Let me try that. 

If AB is parallel to CD, then their slopes must be equal. 

As before, slope of AB is (10 - 0)/(0 - 15) = -2/3. 

Slope of CD: from C(x,y) to D(0,0) is (0 - y)/(0 - x) = y/x. 

Set equal to -2/3: y/x = -2/3 → y = -2x/3. 

Now, AC is from A(15,0) to C(x, y) = (x, -2x/3). Distance AC = 14. 

So, sqrt[(x-15)^2 + (y - 0)^2] = sqrt[(x-15)^2 + (4x²)/9] = 14. Squaring: (x-15)^2 + (4x²)/9 = 196. 

Expand: x² -30x + 225 + (4x²)/9 = 196. Multiply by 9: 9x² - 270x + 2025 + 4x² = 1764 → 13x² -270x + 261 = 0. 

Using quadratic formula: x = [270 ± sqrt(270² - 4*13*261)]/(2*13). 

Calculate discriminant: 72900 - 4*13*261 = 72900 - 13572 = 59328. 

√59328 ≈ 243.57 (since 243^2 = 59049, 244^2 = 59536, so approximately 243.57). 

So x ≈ [270 ± 243.57]/26. 

Two solutions:

x₁ ≈ (270 + 243.57)/26 ≈ 513.57/26 ≈ 19.75 

x₂ ≈ (270 - 243.57)/26 ≈ 26.43/26 ≈ 1.017. 

So x ≈ 19.75 or 1.017. 

Now, let's take x ≈ 19.75. Then y = -2x/3 ≈ -13.17. 

So point C is at (19.75, -
