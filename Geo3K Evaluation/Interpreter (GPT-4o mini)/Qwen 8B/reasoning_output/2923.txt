MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find the length of AB, which is denoted as x. The problem gives me some predicates about a triangle and right angles. Let me start by breaking down the given information.

First, there's a triangle ABC. So points A, B, and C form a triangle. Then it says there's a right angle at Angle(C,A,B). Wait, the notation here might be confusing. In geometry, the angle at point A between points C, A, B would be written as ∠CAB, but the way it's written here is Angle(C,A,B), which probably means the angle at vertex A formed by points C, A, B. But wait, if it's a right angle, then that would mean that angle at A is 90 degrees? Or maybe at point B?

Wait, the notation Angle(C,A,B) typically refers to the angle at point A, with segments AC and AB forming the angle. So that would make angle CAB a right angle. Wait, but the problem states that the right angle is at Angle(C,A,B). So that would imply that angle at A is the right angle. Wait, but then the triangle would have a right angle at A. However, let me double-check.

Alternatively, sometimes the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(C,A,B) is the angle at point A between points C and B. Therefore, angle CAB is a right angle. So triangle ABC has a right angle at A. That would make triangle ABC a right-angled triangle with the right angle at A. 

Then, the lengths given are: LengthOf(Line(C,A)) equals 2, so CA is 2 units. LengthOf(Line(C,B)) equals 5, so CB is 5 units. And LengthOf(Line(A,B)) is x, which we need to find.

Wait, hold on. If the right angle is at A, then sides AC and AB are the legs, and BC is the hypotenuse. But according to the given lengths, CA is 2, AB is x, and CB is 5. Wait, but if it's a right triangle at A, then by Pythagoras, CA² + AB² = CB². Plugging in the numbers: 2² + x² = 5² → 4 + x² = 25 → x² = 21 → x = sqrt(21). Which would correspond to answer choice C.

But wait, let me check again. Is the right angle at A? Because the angle is given as Angle(C,A,B), which is angle at A. So yes, that would make sense. So the triangle has legs AC=2 and AB=x, hypotenuse BC=5. So applying Pythagoras: 2² + x² = 5² → x² = 25 -4 = 21 → x = sqrt(21). So answer C.

But wait, let me confirm once more. Suppose instead the right angle was at another vertex. For example, if the right angle was at B, then the legs would be AB and BC, and hypotenuse AC. But in this case, AC is given as 2, which would be the hypotenuse. Then AB would be one leg, BC another, but then the length of BC isn't given directly. However, the problem says LengthOf(Line(C,B)) is 5, which would be BC. Then if right angle at B, then AB² + BC² = AC². But AC is 2, BC is 5, so AB² + 25 = 4 → AB² negative, impossible. So that can't be. Hence, the right angle must be at A.

Therefore, the correct calculation is sqrt(21), which is answer C. So the Final Answer should be C.
