Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we need to find the measure of arc PJ in circle M, given some other arcs and chord lengths. Let me start by parsing all the given information carefully.

First, the problem mentions several points: F, G, H, J, K, L, P, and others. There's a circle denoted as ⊙M, but wait, the initial predicates mention a circle named with points F, G, H, J, K, L, P. Wait, maybe there's a typo? Because the question says "In ⊙M," so perhaps M is the center? But the circle is defined with those points. Hmm. Maybe M isn't one of the points listed? Or maybe it's a mistake. Let me check again.

Wait, looking at the given predicates, there's a Circle(F,G,H,J,K,L,P). So the circle is constructed using these points. However, the question refers to circle M. That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Alternatively, perhaps the circle is called M, but the points used to define it are F, G, H, J, K, L, P. Maybe M is another point not mentioned in the predicates? Or maybe the circle's name is M, and the points F, G, H, J, K, L, P lie on it. 

But regardless, the main data given includes FL = 24, HJ = 48, and the measure of arc HP is 65 degrees. We need to find the measure of arc PJ. Also, there are various lines and right angles mentioned. Let me try to visualize this.

First, note that HJ is given as 48 units, which is likely a chord length since it's part of the circle. Similarly, FL is 24. Also, there are diameters mentioned: Line(H,J) and Line(K,P) are diameters of the circle. Wait, because the predicate says IsDiameterOf(Line(H,J), Circle(...)) and similarly for Line(K,P). Therefore, HJ and KP are diameters of the circle. Since HJ is a diameter, its length should be twice the radius. Similarly for KP.

So if HJ is a diameter, then its length is 48, which means the radius r is 48 / 2 = 24. Then, FL is given as 24. Wait, FL could be another chord. But FL is a chord of the circle, so maybe it relates to some other property?

Also, there are right angles mentioned: Angle(K,L,G) is a right angle, and Angle(I,N,J) is a right angle. Points L lies on Line(K,G), N lies on Line(H,J). Also, there are lines like Line(F,G), Line(H,J), Line(K,P), Line(L,N).

Hmm, this seems complicated. Let me try to sketch mentally. First, since HJ is a diameter, points H and J are endpoints of a diameter. Similarly, K and P are endpoints of another diameter. So, the circle has two diameters: HJ and KP. Therefore, the center of the circle would be the intersection point of these diameters. Let's call the center O. Wait, but the circle is referred to as ⊙M. Maybe M is the center? If so, then M would be the midpoint of both HJ and KP. Since HJ is a diameter, its midpoint is the center. So, coordinates might help here, but maybe I don't need coordinates.

Now, given that HJ is a diameter of length 48, radius is 24. FL is given as 24. Since FL is a chord, maybe it's related to another diameter or something. Also, there's an arc HP measuring 65 degrees. Need to find arc PJ.

Let me think about arcs and central angles. The measure of an arc is equal to the measure of its central angle. So, if we can relate the arcs HP and PJ through central angles, perhaps via properties of the circle.

Since HJ is a diameter, the arc HJ would be 180 degrees. Similarly, KP is a diameter, so arc KP is also 180 degrees. Now, the problem gives arc HP as 65 degrees. Let me see where point P is located. Since KP is a diameter, P is the endpoint opposite K. So, if we consider diameter KP, then K and P are endpoints. So, moving along the circumference from K to P is half the circle, 180 degrees.

But arc HP is given as 65 degrees. Let me imagine points H, J, K, P on the circle. Since HJ and KP are diameters, they intersect at the center. Let me denote the center as O (assuming M is O). Wait, but the circle is called ⊙M, so M is the center. Therefore, M is the center of the circle. Hence, the diameters HJ and KP pass through M. So, H and J are endpoints of one diameter, K and P are endpoints of another diameter.

Therefore, points H, J, K, P are all on the circle, with HJ and KP being diameters. So, the center M is the midpoint of both HJ and KP. Thus, HM = MJ = 24 (since HJ is 48), and KM = MP = 24 (since KP is also a diameter, but wait, KP's length is not given directly. Wait, earlier, FL was given as 24. Wait, but KP is a diameter. Wait, but the problem states that FL=24. Wait, FL is a chord. So, FL is a chord of length 24. How does that relate to the circle?

Alternatively, maybe FL is another diameter? No, because FL is mentioned as a chord. Wait, the problem says "F L = 24", so FL is a segment connecting points F and L, which are on the circle. So FL is a chord of length 24. Given that the radius is 24, since HJ is 48 (diameter), so radius is 24. So FL is equal to the radius. Interesting.

So, FL is a chord of length equal to the radius. For a circle of radius r, the length of a chord can be found using the formula: chord length = 2r sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle subtended by the chord. Here, chord FL has length 24, which equals r (since r=24). Therefore:

FL = 2r sin(θ/2) => 24 = 2*24*sin(θ/2) => sin(θ/2) = 24/(2*24) = 1/2. Therefore, θ/2 = 30°, so θ = 60°. Therefore, the central angle corresponding to chord FL is 60 degrees. So, the arc FL measures 60 degrees.

But how does this help us with arc PJ? Let me think.

We know that arc HP is 65 degrees. Need to find arc PJ. Let me try to figure out the positions of points H, P, J, and K.

Since HJ is a diameter, and KP is another diameter. Let me assume that the circle has center M. So, H and J are endpoints of one diameter, K and P are endpoints of another diameter. So, the two diameters HJ and KP intersect at the center M. Depending on the angle between the diameters, different arcs will form.

Arc HP is given as 65 degrees. Let me consider the position of point P. Since KP is a diameter, P is opposite to K. Let me try to imagine the diagram. Suppose we have two diameters HJ and KP crossing at the center M. The angle between them affects the arcs.

Point H is on one end of diameter HJ, point P is on the other end of diameter KP. So, the arc from H to P would depend on the angle between the diameters HJ and KP.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that arc HP + arc PJ + arc JK + ... ? Not sure yet.

Alternatively, considering that arc HP is 65 degrees. Since HJ is a diameter, arc HJ is 180 degrees. If we can express arc HP in terms of other arcs.

Let me consider the entire circle as 360 degrees. Arc HP is 65 degrees. Let me think about the location of point P relative to H. Since H is on diameter HJ, and P is on diameter KP. Let me think of the circle divided by diameters HJ and KP.

Suppose the angle between diameters HJ and KP is θ. Then, depending on θ, the arcs would vary. For example, if the diameters are perpendicular, θ is 90 degrees, leading to certain arc measures. But here, the angle between the diameters may not be given directly.

Alternatively, since there are right angles mentioned in the predicates. For instance, Angle(K,L,G) is a right angle. And PointL lies on Line(K,G). Also, PointN lies on Line(H,J). Also, there's a right angle at Angle(I,N,J). But these points may not be directly relevant unless connected to the arcs in question. However, since the problem doesn't mention points I or L except in the predicates, maybe they are red herrings? Or maybe they are part of constructing the diagram.

Alternatively, focusing back on the main elements: the circle with diameters HJ and KP, and arc HP is 65 degrees. Need to find arc PJ.

Let me try to consider the central angles. Let’s denote the center as M. Since HJ is a diameter, the central angle for arc HJ is 180 degrees. Similarly, for arc KP, it's also 180 degrees. Now, the arc HP is given as 65 degrees. Let me imagine the circle with diameters HJ and KP intersecting at M. So, the angle between HJ and KP is determined by the angle between the two diameters. Let's say the angle between HJ and KP is φ. Then, the arcs created by these diameters would divide the circle into four arcs.

For example, starting from H, going around the circle through the direction of KP, the arc from H to P would be composed of parts of the circle. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to tell. However, since HJ and KP are diameters, their intersection creates vertical angles. Let me consider the angle between diameters HJ and KP. Let’s suppose that the angle between HJ and KP is such that the arc HP corresponds to 65 degrees.

Alternatively, since HJ is a diameter, the arc from H to J is 180 degrees. Similarly, the arc from K to P is 180 degrees. The arc HP connects H to P. To find this arc's measure, we need to consider the position of P relative to H.

Assuming that the diameters HJ and KP intersect at the center M. So, the angle between HJ and KP is some angle, say θ. Then, the arc from H to P would be equal to half the sum or difference of certain arcs, depending on the position.

Wait, another approach: The measure of arc HP depends on the central angle ∠HMP. Since M is the center, the arc HP is equal to the measure of ∠HMP. So, if I can find ∠HMP, that would give me the measure of arc HP, which is given as 65 degrees. But how?

Alternatively, since HJ and KP are diameters, each passing through M. Let me consider the angle between the diameters HJ and KP. Let’s say the angle between HJ and KP is α. Then, the arc between H and P would depend on α.

Imagine standing at point H, looking towards J (the diameter HJ). The diameter KP passes through M, making an angle α with HJ. So, from H, the direction to P would be determined by rotating α degrees from HJ. Depending on whether α is acute or obtuse, the arc HP could be α or 180 - α, but since the arc is given as 65 degrees, that would imply that α is either 65 degrees or supplementary to it. However, without more info, this might not hold.

Alternatively, since arc HP is 65 degrees, then the central angle ∠HMP is 65 degrees. Therefore, the angle between diameters HJ and KP is 65 degrees? Not necessarily, because ∠HMP is formed by the intersection of HJ and KP at M. Wait, HJ is a straight line (from H to J), and KP is another straight line (from K to P). Their intersection is at M, the center. So, the angle between HJ and KP at M is the angle between the two diameters. Let's call that angle β. Then, ∠HMP would be either β or 180 - β, depending on the direction. But since arc HP is 65 degrees, then ∠HMP is 65 degrees, so β = 65 degrees or 180 - 65 = 115 degrees. But how do we know which?

Alternatively, since the diameters HJ and KP intersect at M, forming two vertical angles. Let's assume that the angle between HJ and KP is β. Then, the arc HP would correspond to the angle between H and P as seen from the center. Let me think: Starting at H, going counterclockwise to P. The arc length would be the measure of the central angle between H and P. Which would depend on the angle between the diameters HJ and KP.

If the angle between HJ and KP is β, then moving from H to P would involve going along HJ to M, then turning β degrees towards KP to reach P. Wait, this might not be straightforward. Perhaps it's easier to consider that the total circle is 360 degrees. The diameters divide the circle into four arcs. Each pair of diameters forms two pairs of vertical angles. The arcs between the ends of the diameters would be determined by these angles.

For example, if the angle between HJ and KP is β, then the arcs between H and K, K and J, J and P, and P and H would be determined by β and 180 - β. Wait, no. Actually, each diameter divides the circle into two semicircles. The angle between the two diameters would split the circle into four arcs. The measure of each arc would depend on the angle between the diameters.

For instance, if the angle between diameters HJ and KP is β, then the arcs between H and K, K and J, J and P, and P and H would be... Well, each of those arcs would be half of the total circle. Wait, no. Let me think of the circle divided by two diameters. The angle between the diameters splits the circle into four arcs. The sum of the arcs around the circle is 360 degrees. Each pair of opposite arcs would be equal. For example, if the angle between diameters HJ and KP is β, then the arcs between H and K, and between J and P would be β, while the arcs between K and J, and between P and H would be 180 - β? No, that doesn't add up. Let me try again.

Actually, when two diameters intersect, they form four angles at the center. Each of these angles corresponds to arcs. For example, if the angle between HJ and KP is β, then the arcs opposite to β would be 360 - 2β? No, not quite. Let me consider that the two diameters create four angles at the center: two angles of β and two angles of 180 - β. Wait, no. If two lines cross, they create vertical angles. So, if the angle between HJ and KP is β, then the vertical angles are β and the other two angles would be 180 - β. Wait, no. When two lines intersect, the adjacent angles are supplementary. So, if one angle is β, then the adjacent angles are 180 - β, and the opposite angle is β. So, the four angles at the center are β, 180 - β, β, and 180 - β. Therefore, the arcs corresponding to these angles would be β, 180 - β, β, and 180 - β. 

Wait, but the arcs are determined by the central angles. So, if one of the angles at the center is β, then the arc corresponding to that angle is β degrees. So, for example, if we take the arc from H to K, that would be β degrees, assuming that the angle between HJ and KP is β. Similarly, the arc from K to J would be 180 - β degrees, and so on.

But how does this help with arc HP? Let me see. Let's label the points: H and J are endpoints of one diameter, K and P are endpoints of another. Assuming that the diameters HJ and KP intersect at M. So, the order of the points around the circle would depend on the angle between the diameters. Let me try to imagine placing H at the top of the circle, J at the bottom (so HJ is vertical), and K and P somewhere else. If the angle between HJ and KP is β, then depending on where K and P are placed.

Let me assume that the angle between HJ (vertical) and KP is β degrees. So, starting at H (top), going clockwise, the next point might be K, then J, then P, then back to H. But this depends on the orientation.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to focus on the arc HP. If the angle between the diameters HJ and KP is β, then the arc from H to P would be equal to β plus the arc from J to P? No, not sure.

Alternatively, think of the entire circle. The arc HP consists of two parts: from H to J (which is 180 degrees) and from J to P. Wait, no. If H is one end of diameter HJ, and P is one end of diameter KP, then the arc from H to P can be considered as going through the side opposite to the angle between the diameters.

Alternatively, since HJ and KP are diameters, the arc from H to P can be computed as follows: the angle between HJ and KP is β, then the arc from H to P would be 180 - β degrees. Wait, why?

Because if you imagine the diameters HJ and KP intersecting at the center M. The angle between them is β. So, if you go from H to P, that arc would span across the angle between HJ and KP. If you move from H, along the circle, past the direction of KP, the arc HP would cover an angle of β + some other angle. This is getting too vague.

Alternatively, since arc HP is given as 65 degrees, and we need to find arc PJ. Let me consider that the total circle is 360 degrees. The arc HP is 65 degrees. What about the other arcs?

If I can find the measure of arc PJ, perhaps using relationships between arcs. For example, if there are other arcs that can be determined based on the diameters and given information.

Wait, since KP is a diameter, arc KP is 180 degrees. So, from K to P is 180 degrees. If I can find the relationship between arc KP and arc HP, maybe.

But point H is not on KP. So, arc HP goes from H to P. Let me think about the entire circle. If we can express arc HP as part of the circle, and then find other arcs accordingly.

Another idea: Since HJ and KP are diameters, then points H, J, K, P are all on the circle, and the center is M. So, the positions of these points are such that M is the midpoint of both diameters.

Given that, the arc HP is 65 degrees. Let me consider triangle HMP. In this triangle, MH and MP are radii of the circle, each 24 units. So, triangle HMP is an isosceles triangle with sides MH = MP = 24, and angle at M being 65 degrees (since arc HP is 65 degrees, so central angle ∠HMP = 65 degrees). Therefore, the base angles of triangle HMP would be (180 - 65)/2 = 57.5 degrees each.

But how does this help us find arc PJ? Maybe not directly. Let me think about other arcs.

Since KP is a diameter, the arc from K to P is 180 degrees. If I can find the arc from P to J, then adding it to arc HP might give some relation.

Wait, but where is point J? It's the other end of diameter HJ. So, arc from J to P would depend on the position of P relative to J.

Alternatively, consider the entire circle. The sum of all arcs is 360 degrees. If we can find other arcs, we can subtract to get arc PJ.

But what arcs do we know? Arc HP = 65 degrees. Arc HJ = 180 degrees. Arc KP = 180 degrees. But how do these overlap?

Maybe we can consider the arcs that make up the circle. Let me imagine the circle with diameters HJ and KP. The circle is divided into four arcs: from H to K, K to J, J to P, and P to H. Wait, but that assumes a particular arrangement. Alternatively, the arcs between the endpoints of the diameters.

Wait, if we have two diameters intersecting, the circle is divided into four arcs. The measures of these arcs depend on the angle between the diameters. Let me denote the angle between HJ and KP as θ. Then, the arcs between the endpoints would be θ, 180 - θ, θ, and 180 - θ. Wait, no. Let me clarify.

When two diameters intersect at the center, creating an angle θ, then the arcs between their endpoints would be as follows:

Starting from point H, moving along the circle, the first arc would be θ degrees (arc HK), then from K to J would be 180 - θ degrees (arc KJ), then from J to P would be θ degrees (arc JP), and finally from P back to H would be 180 - θ degrees (arc PH). Wait, this seems arbitrary. Let me think again.

Actually, the angle between the diameters determines how the circle is divided. If the angle between diameters HJ and KP is θ, then the arcs between the endpoints would be θ and 180 - θ. For example, if you have two diameters intersecting at angle θ, then the arcs between their endpoints are θ and 180 - θ. But how exactly?

Imagine two diameters intersecting at θ. The arc between H and K would be θ degrees, and the arc between K and J would be 180 - θ degrees, then from J to P would be θ degrees, and from P to H would be 180 - θ degrees. But this depends on the direction of rotation. Alternatively, the arcs could be θ, 180 - θ, θ, and 180 - θ. Adding them together: θ + (180 - θ) + θ + (180 - θ) = 360 degrees. Yes, that works.

So, if arc HP is 65 degrees, then depending on which arc it is. If arc HP is one of the arcs between H and P, which would be either θ or 180 - θ. Let's assume that arc HP is one of these arcs. For example, if the arc from H to P is θ, then θ = 65 degrees. Then, the other arcs would be 180 - 65 = 115 degrees. But then, what is arc PJ?

Looking at the arcs, if the arcs between the endpoints are θ, 180 - θ, θ, and 180 - θ, then arc PJ would be one of these. If arc HP is θ, then arc PJ would be 180 - θ, or θ again, depending on the arrangement. But this requires knowing which arc HP corresponds to.

Alternatively, if the arc HP is 65 degrees, and if it's one of the arcs between H and P, then depending on which of the four arcs it is, we can determine other arcs. For example, if arc HP is θ = 65 degrees, then the arc from J to P would be 180 - θ = 115 degrees. But how does that relate to arc PJ?

Wait, arc PJ is from P to J. If arc from J to P is 115 degrees, then arc PJ is the same as arc JP, which is 115 degrees. But the question asks for arc PJ, which would be 115 degrees. But that's not among the options. Wait, the answer choices are A. 37.5, B. 65, C. 85, D. 130. So 115 isn't there. So my assumption must be wrong.

Alternatively, maybe arc HP is 180 - θ. So if arc HP is 65 degrees, then 180 - θ = 65 → θ = 115 degrees. Then, the other arcs would be θ = 115 degrees and 180 - θ = 65 degrees. So, arc PJ would be one of these. If arc PJ is θ = 115 degrees, then that's still not matching the options. Wait, but maybe arc PJ is the other arc?

Wait, this approach may not be working. Let me try another way. Since arc HP is 65 degrees, and we need to find arc PJ. Let me recall that the sum of arcs around the circle is 360 degrees. If I can find other arcs, I can compute arc PJ.

But what other arcs do I know? Well, we know that arc HJ is 180 degrees (since it's a diameter). Arc KP is also 180 degrees. But how do these relate to arc HP and PJ?

Alternatively, consider that arc HP + arc PJ + arc JK + arc KH = 360 degrees. But without knowing other arcs, this might not help.

Wait, but maybe there's another approach. Since HJ and KP are diameters, then points H, J, K, and P are all on the circle. Let me consider the quadrilateral HJKP. Since HJ and KP are diameters, this quadrilateral is made up of two diameters intersecting at the center M. So, it's a rectangle? Wait, no, because the diameters may not be perpendicular. Unless specified otherwise.

But since there are right angles mentioned in the predicates, maybe this is relevant. For example, Angle(K,L,G) is a right angle, and Point L lies on Line(K,G). Also, Angle(I,N,J) is a right angle, with Point N on Line(H,J). These points might form right triangles, which could be helpful.

But since the problem focuses on finding arc PJ, perhaps the right angles are distractions. However, they might be crucial for determining the angle between the diameters HJ and KP, which in turn helps find arc PJ.

Let me revisit the right angles. Angle(K,L,G) is a right angle. Point L lies on Line(K,G). So, this suggests that triangle KLG is a right triangle with right angle at L. Similarly, Angle(I,N,J) is a right angle, with Point N on Line(H,J). So, triangle INJ is a right triangle with right angle at N.

But without knowing where points I, L, G are, it's challenging to connect these to the rest of the diagram. However, since FL is given as 24, which we previously deduced corresponds to a 60-degree arc, maybe these right angles are related to the positioning of points L and N, which might be connected to other elements.

Wait, let me think again about FL. Earlier, I assumed that FL is a chord of length 24, which gave a central angle of 60 degrees. But maybe FL is part of one of these right triangles. For example, if L is on Line(K,G), and there's a right angle at L, then maybe FL is related to that triangle.

However, without more information about the positions of these points, it's difficult to proceed. Maybe I should focus back on the arc measures.

Earlier, I had a conflict where assuming arc HP is θ or 180 - θ led to results not matching the answer choices. Let me try another angle. Since arc HP is 65 degrees, and we need arc PJ. Let me consider that the arc from H to P is 65 degrees. Since HJ is a diameter (180 degrees), then the arc from H to J is 180 degrees. If arc HP is 65 degrees, then the remaining arc from P to J would be 180 - 65 = 115 degrees. Wait, but that would mean arc PJ is 115 degrees. But 115 isn't one of the options. However, the answer choices are A. 37.5, B. 65, C. 85, D. 130. So this suggests my assumption is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the arc from H to P is not directly part of the diameter HJ. Let me consider that the arc from H to P passes through the other side of the circle. For example, if HJ is a diameter, and KP is another diameter, then the arc from H to P could be the major arc or minor arc. If it's the minor arc HP, it's 65 degrees. Then, the major arc HP would be 360 - 65 = 295 degrees. But how does that help?

Alternatively, since arc HP is 65 degrees, and KP is a diameter, then the arc from K to P is 180 degrees. If I can find the relationship between arc KP and arc HP, maybe through other arcs.

Let me think about the full circle. If I can find the measure of arc KP, which is 180 degrees, and arc HP is 65 degrees, then perhaps arc from H to K plus arc from K to P equals arc from H to P? Wait, no. If you go from H to K to P, that would be arc HK + arc KP. But arc KP is 180 degrees. So, arc HK + 180 = arc HP? No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, if the arc from H to P is composed of arc HJ (180 degrees) minus arc JP. So, arc HP = arc HJ - arc JP. If arc HP is 65 degrees, then 180 - arc JP = 65 → arc JP = 180 - 65 = 115 degrees. Again, this leads to arc JP = 15 degrees? No, 180 - 65 is 115. But again, 115 isn't an option. So this suggests that my assumption about the composition of arc HP is wrong.

Wait, maybe arc HP is not overlapping with HJ. Let me try to visualize the circle with diameters HJ and KP. Let me place point H at the top, J at the bottom, K on the left, and P on the right. Then, the arc from H to P would go clockwise from H to P, passing through the right side. If the angle between the diameters HJ (vertical) and KP (horizontal) is 90 degrees, then arc HP would be 90 degrees. But in our case, it's 65 degrees. So the angle between the diameters is 65 degrees. Therefore, the arc from H to P would be equal to the angle between the diameters, which is 65 degrees. Hence, arc HP = 65 degrees. Then, the arc from P to J would be the remaining part of the circle. Since the total circle is 360 degrees, and arc HJ is 180 degrees, arc KP is 180 degrees. But how does this relate?

Wait, if the angle between HJ and KP is 65 degrees, then the arc from H to P is 65 degrees. Then, the arc from P to J would be 180 - 65 = 115 degrees. So arc PJ is 115 degrees. But 115 is not among the answer choices. So this suggests that my understanding is missing something.

Wait, the answer choices are A. 37.5, B. 65, C. 85, D. 130. None of these are 115. So perhaps there's a different interpretation.

Wait, maybe the arc HP is not the angle between the diameters but something else. Let me consider that the arc HP is 65 degrees, and we need to find arc PJ. Let me think about the relationship between these arcs and the diameter KP.

Since KP is a diameter, the arc from K to P is 180 degrees. Let me consider the arc from P to J. If I can find this arc, it would be arc PJ. Let me try to find it using other arcs.

If I can find the measure of arc PK, which is 180 degrees, and arc PH is 65 degrees, then the arc from H to K would be arc HK = arc HJ - arc JP. Wait, this is getting too tangled.

Another idea: Since HJ and KP are diameters, the center M is the intersection of these diameters. Let me consider triangle HJP. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe using the fact that FL is 24, which we said corresponds to a central angle of 60 degrees. So, the arc FL is 60 degrees. Let me assume that FL is part of the diagram. If FL is a chord, and we know its length, maybe it relates to other arcs.

But how? If FL is a chord of length 24, and the radius is 24, then the central angle for FL is 60 degrees, as calculated before. So, arc FL is 60 degrees. But how does this help us with arc PJ?

Perhaps there's a connection between arc FL and arc PJ through some geometric relations. For example, if points F, L are connected to other points, but without more info, it's hard to say.

Wait, looking back at the original predicates, there are several lines: Line(F,G), Line(H,J), Line(K,P), Line(L,N). Also, PointL lies on Line(K,G), and PointN lies on Line(H,J). Also, there are right angles at Angle(K,L,G) and Angle(I,N,J). This suggests that there are several triangles and possibly some right triangles.

Let me focus on the right angle at Angle(K,L,G). Since it's a right angle, triangle KLG is a right triangle with right angle at L. Also, Point L lies on Line(K,G). So, L is on the line KG. Let me assume that line KG is a line extending from K through G, and L is some point on it. Since it's a right angle at L, KL is perpendicular to GL. But without knowing where G is, it's hard to proceed.

Similarly, Angle(I,N,J) is a right angle, with Point N on Line(H,J). So, triangle INJ is a right triangle at N, with N lying on HJ. Since HJ is a diameter, N is a point on the diameter HJ. So, if I can find some relationship here.

This seems too abstract without a diagram. Maybe I should try to look for another approach.

Let me recall that in a circle, the measure of an arc is equal to the measure of its central angle. Also, inscribed angles are half the measure of their intercepted arcs. But I don't see immediate inscribed angles here.

Wait, the problem mentions arc HP is 65 degrees. So, the central angle for arc HP is 65 degrees. Let me consider that this central angle is formed by points H, M, P, where M is the center. So, ∠HMP = 65 degrees. Now, since KP is a diameter, MP is a radius, so MP = 24. Similarly, MH is also a radius, 24. So, triangle HMP is isosceles with sides MH = MP = 24, and included angle 65 degrees. Using the Law of Cosines, we can find HP:

HP² = MH² + MP² - 2*MH*MP*cos(angle HMP)
HP² = 24² + 24² - 2*24*24*cos(65°)
HP² = 2*(24²)*(1 - cos(65°))

But we know from the problem statement that FL = 24. Wait, but FL is another chord. However, this calculation gives us the length of HP, which we don't know. But since the problem doesn't provide HP's length, this might not be helpful.

Alternatively, since FL = 24, and FL is a chord of the circle with radius 24, as we previously determined, giving a central angle of 60 degrees. So, arc FL is 60 degrees. Maybe this arc FL is related to arc PJ somehow? For example, if there's a symmetry or some inscribed angle relating these arcs.

But without knowing the positions of points F and L, it's hard to see the connection. The problem mentions Line(F,G), Line(H,J), Line(K,P), Line(L,N). Point L is on Line(K,G). So, line KG contains point L. If FL is a chord, then F and L are points on the circle, with L on line KG. Maybe FL is related to the right angle at L.

Since Angle(K,L,G) is a right angle, and L is on KG, then KL is perpendicular to LG. So, triangle KLG is right-angled at L. Since L is on line KG, which is extended from K to G. But without knowing where G is, it's challenging to proceed.

At this point, I'm stuck. Let me try to summarize what I know:

- Circle with diameter HJ (length 48, radius 24).
- Another diameter KP (unknown length, but since it's a diameter, it should also be 48? Wait, wait! Wait, earlier I thought HJ is a diameter with length 48, so radius 24. But KP is also a diameter. So, its length should also be 2*r = 48. But the problem says FL = 24, which is a chord, not a diameter. So, KP is a diameter of length 48, hence its length is 48. So, KP = 48. But the problem didn't specify KP's length, just that it's a diameter.

But earlier, I thought FL is a chord of length 24, which is equal to the radius. So, that gives us a central angle of 60 degrees for arc FL.

Now, returning to arc HP = 65 degrees. Need to find arc PJ.

Maybe the key is to realize that arc HP and arc PJ are related through the diameter KP. Since KP is a diameter, the arc from K to P is 180 degrees. If we can find the relationship between arc HP and arc PJ via this diameter.

Let me imagine that the arc from H to P is 65 degrees, and the arc from P to J is what we need. Since HJ is a diameter, arc HJ is 180 degrees. So, arc HJ = arc HP + arc PJ. Wait, if the arc from H to J passes through P, then yes. But is that the case?

If the arc from H to J passes through P, then arc HJ = arc HP + arc PJ. So, 180 = 65 + arc PJ → arc PJ = 115 degrees. Again, this is not an option. So this suggests that either the arc from H to J doesn't pass through P, or there's another factor.

Alternatively, if the arc from H to P is 65 degrees, and the arc from P to J is x degrees, then the arc from H to J could be either 65 + x or |65 - x|, depending on which arc is taken. If it's the shorter arc, then it would be 65 + x = 180 → x = 115. But again, 115 is not an option.

Wait, maybe the arc from H to P is not the arc that passes through J. Maybe it's the other arc. For example, if the arc HP is the major arc, then it would be 360 - 65 = 295 degrees. But that doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between arc HP and arc PJ through the other diameter KP. Since KP is a diameter, the arc from K to P is 180 degrees. If I can find the relationship between arc KP and arc HP, maybe through some other arc.

Let me try to consider the entire circle. Total circle is 360 degrees. If I can find the measure of arc HJ (180), arc KP (180), and arc HP (65), but how?

Wait, arc HJ is 180 degrees. Arc KP is 180 degrees. The arc from H to P is 65 degrees. Let me try to find the measure of arc PJ by considering the intersection of these arcs.

If I can find the measure of arc from P to J, it would be arc PJ. Let me imagine the circle with points H, J, K, P. The arc from H to P is 65 degrees. The arc from K to P is 180 degrees. If I can find the arc from H to K, then I can use that to find arc PJ.

But how? Let me think: arc from H to K + arc from K to P = arc from H to P? No, that would be true if the paths are direct. But if the arc from H to K is part of the circle, and the arc from K to P is 180 degrees, then arc from H to P would be arc HK + arc KP. But arc KP is 180, so arc HP = arc HK + 180. But arc HP is given as 65, so arc HK = 65 - 180 = -115, which is impossible. So this approach is wrong.

Alternatively, if arc from H to P is the difference between arc HK and arc KP? Not sure.

At this point, I'm running out of ideas. Let me revisit the answer choices: 37.5, 65, 85, 130. The given arc HP is 65, which is one of the choices. Could it be that arc PJ is 130 degrees? Why?

If arc HP is 65, and there's some relationship where arc PJ is double that, or supplementary.

Wait, if arc HP is 65 degrees, and arc PJ is 130 degrees, then together they make 195 degrees, which doesn't directly relate. But maybe there's a cyclic quadrilateral or something.

Alternatively, since KP is a diameter, and arc KP is 180 degrees, if arc HP is 65 degrees, then the arc from P to K would be 180 - 65 = 115 degrees. But arc from P to K is 115 degrees. Then, if we consider arc from P to J, which is what we want, and arc from K to J is 180 degrees (since KJ is part of the diameter HJ? No, K is on diameter KP, J is on diameter HJ.

Wait, if arc from K to J is part of the circle. Since K is on diameter KP, and J is on diameter HJ. The arc from K to J would depend on the angle between the diameters. If the angle between HJ and KP is 65 degrees, then the arc from K to J would be 180 - 65 = 115 degrees. Then, arc from P to J would be arc from P to K (115 degrees) plus arc from K to J (180 degrees)? No, that would be 295 degrees, which is too much.

I'm really stuck here. Let me think about the possibility that arc PJ is 130 degrees. Why? If arc HP is 65, and there's a relationship where arc PJ is twice that, or supplementary. Or, if there's an inscribed angle that relates to it.

Wait, if there's an inscribed angle subtending arc PJ, its measure would be half the arc. But without knowing any inscribed angles, this is speculative.

Alternatively, since FL is a chord of 24, which corresponds to a central angle of 60 degrees, maybe this arc FL is related to arc PJ. For example, if arc FL and arc PJ are supplementary or something.

But without knowing the exact positions of F and L, it's hard to say. 

Wait, let me try to think differently. Since the problem involves multiple diameters and right angles, perhaps there's a way to use the right angles to find the angle between the diameters, which would help find the arc measures.

For example, if there's a right angle at L (angle KLG), and L is on line KG, then maybe triangle KLG is a right triangle with KL and GL as legs, and KG as
