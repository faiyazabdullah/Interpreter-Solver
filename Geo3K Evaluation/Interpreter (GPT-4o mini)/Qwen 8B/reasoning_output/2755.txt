MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So we have these angle measures given in terms of x, and we need to find the measure of angle H. Let me start by writing down all the given information.

First, the predicates are:

- Measure of angle EFC is x + 20 degrees.
- Measure of angle FCH is x + 5 degrees.
- Measure of angle CHJ is x - 5 degrees.
- Measure of angle HJE is x + 10 degrees.

Wait, but how do these angles relate? I think they form some sort of polygon or maybe intersecting lines. Since the points mentioned are E, F, C, H, J, maybe there's a pentagon or something? Or perhaps a star shape? But without a diagram, it's a bit tricky. However, since the angles are at different vertices, maybe they're part of a larger figure where each angle connects to the next.

Let me try to visualize. Let's assume that these points form a polygon. For example, if we consider points E, F, C, H, J connected in order, forming a pentagon. Then the angles mentioned would be consecutive angles. Wait, but the angles given are at different vertices. Let me check again.

Angle EFC means vertex at F, with sides FE and FC. Then angle FCH is at point C, with sides FC and CH. Angle CHJ is at point H, with sides HC and HJ. Angle HJE is at point J, with sides HJ and JE. Hmm, so connecting these points: E-F-C-H-J-E. That forms a pentagon. So the angles at each vertex are given in terms of x. 

But wait, in a pentagon, the sum of interior angles is (5-2)*180 = 540 degrees. So if we add up all five angles, they should total 540. Let me see if that applies here. Let's list all the angles:

At point E: angle HEJ? Wait, no. The given angles are:

1. At F: angle EFC = x + 20
2. At C: angle FCH = x + 5
3. At H: angle CHJ = x - 5
4. At J: angle HJE = x + 10

Wait, but where is the fifth angle? Because a pentagon has five angles. Maybe there's another angle at point E? Let me check. The angles given are EFC, FCH, CHJ, HJE. So missing is the angle at point E. Wait, but angle at E would be between points J, E, and maybe another point? Wait, if the pentagon is E-F-C-H-J-E, then the angles are at each vertex. So the fifth angle would be at point E, formed by J-E-F. So angle FEJ?

So the five angles are:

At E: angle FEJ (which isn't directly given)
At F: angle EFC = x + 20
At C: angle FCH = x + 5
At H: angle CHJ = x - 5
At J: angle HJE = x + 10

So if we can express all five angles in terms of x, then sum them up to 540.

But we don't know the fifth angle. Wait, but maybe there's more than one way to look at this. Alternatively, perhaps these angles are not the internal angles of a pentagon but parts of other figures. Another possibility is that these angles are around a point, but that seems less likely. Wait, but angle EFC, FCH, CHJ, HJE – maybe they are adjacent angles forming a straight line or something else?

Alternatively, maybe these angles are part of a triangle or another polygon. Let me think again. Suppose that points E, F, C, H, J are arranged such that lines connect them in sequence. Let me imagine starting at E, going to F, then to C, then to H, then to J, then back to E. So forming a pentagon. Therefore, each internal angle is at each vertex. But we only have four angles given. Wait, unless there's another angle at E that we need to account for.

Alternatively, maybe the figure is not a pentagon but a different configuration. For instance, maybe there are overlapping lines or triangles. Let me consider that angle EFC is at F, angle FCH is at C, angle CHJ is at H, angle HJE is at J. So maybe the lines EF, FC, CH, HJ, JE form a closed shape. So that's five segments: EF, FC, CH, HJ, JE. Connecting E to F to C to H to J to E. So yes, a pentagon. Thus, the five internal angles would be at E, F, C, H, J. We have four of those angles expressed in terms of x, and need to find the fifth. Wait, but the question asks for m∠H, which is the angle at H, which is given as x - 5. Wait, but if that's the case, then why do we need to find it? Unless there's more to the problem. Wait, maybe the given angles are not the internal angles but some other angles. Maybe they are exterior angles or something else.

Wait, hold on. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The user says:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(E, F, C)), x+20)" — so angle at F, with segments FE and FC. Similarly, angle at C between FC and CH, angle at H between HC and HJ, angle at J between HJ and JE. So if these points are connected in order E-F-C-H-J-E, then each of these angles is an internal angle of the pentagon. So the sum of all five internal angles should be 540 degrees. However, we only have four of them given. Wait, but the angle at E is missing. So let's denote the angle at E as y. Then:

Sum of angles: (x+20) + (x+5) + (x-5) + (x+10) + y = 540.

Simplify: 4x + 20 + 5 -5 +10 + y = 540 → 4x + 30 + y = 540 → y = 510 - 4x.

But we don't know y. How can we find x? There must be another relationship. Perhaps there's another condition that relates these angles. Wait, maybe the figure is not a simple pentagon but something else. For example, if the lines are not all connected as a single pentagon but form intersecting lines creating other angles. Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involved. Let me think again.

Another possibility: These angles could be part of a transversal or something with parallel lines. But without knowing the configuration, it's challenging. Alternatively, maybe the angles are related through vertical angles or supplementary angles. Let me check each angle:

For instance, angle EFC is at F. Then angle FCH is at C. Are these angles adjacent? If lines FC and CH are connected, then angle at C is FCH. If the lines are extended, maybe forming linear pairs. Wait, but without seeing the diagram, this is speculative. However, given that the problem gives us four angles in terms of x, and asks for m∠H, which is one of them (x-5), but that seems odd because if we had all five angles, we could solve for x. But since we only have four angles, perhaps there's a mistake in my assumption.

Wait, maybe the figure is not a pentagon but a quadrilateral? Let me check. Suppose there are four points, but with two angles given. No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the angles are part of a triangle. Wait, but the points mentioned are E, F, C, H, J, so more than three points. 

Alternative idea: Maybe the points form a star or intersecting lines, leading to multiple angles. For example, if there's a pentagram (a five-pointed star), but that usually has ten angles. Not sure.

Wait, maybe the angles are not all internal angles of a single polygon. Let me think differently. Suppose that the angles given are angles in a triangle or other figure. For example, suppose that lines EC and FH intersect at some point, forming various angles. But without knowing the exact configuration, this is too vague.

Wait, another thought: Could these angles be around a point? Like, if multiple angles meet at a common vertex? For instance, if all the angles share a common vertex. But angle EFC is at F, angle FCH is at C, angle CHJ is at H, angle HJE is at J. So they are at different vertices. So that doesn't seem to be the case.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me go back to the initial idea about the pentagon. Even though we have four angles, maybe the fifth angle is zero or something? No, that doesn't make sense. Or maybe there's another equation involving x. Wait, perhaps the sum of angles around a point? For example, if certain lines are straight, creating supplementary angles. 

Wait, let's consider the possibility that the figure is made up of several triangles connected together. For example, if we have triangle EFC, then triangle FCH, etc. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe the angles are parts of a cyclic quadrilateral or something. Wait, but again, without knowing the connections, it's unclear.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me check again the problem statement. It says "Find m∠H." The angle at H is given as x - 5. So if I can find x, then I can compute it. So the key is to find x. How?

Since I don't have enough equations yet, perhaps there's another relationship. Let me think: Maybe the sum of angles around a point equals 360 degrees. For example, if lines intersect at a point, making angles that sum to 360. 

Suppose that at point C, we have angle FCH (given as x +5). Also, if there's another angle at point C from another line. Wait, but without knowing the full structure, this is uncertain.

Wait, another angle: angle EFC is at F. If line FC is connected to line FE and line FC, and maybe line FC is also connected to another line. Maybe there's a triangle or another angle at F. But again, without a diagram, it's ambiguous.

Wait, but maybe all these angles are angles of a triangle. Wait, but there are four angles given. That doesn't fit. 

Wait, here's an alternative approach. Let's suppose that the given angles are the angles of a triangle. But with four angles, that's impossible. So that can't be. 

Wait, perhaps the angles are part of a larger system where multiple polygons are present. For example, maybe there's a triangle with some other lines. 

Alternatively, think about the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180. Suppose that some of the given angles are angles in a triangle. For example, if angle EFC, angle FCH, and angle HJE are angles in a triangle. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, maybe there's a straight line somewhere. For instance, if two angles form a straight line, adding up to 180 degrees. For example, angle EFC and another angle might be supplementary. But again, without knowing which angles are adjacent, this is guesswork.

Wait, here's a new idea: Let's assume that the points E, F, C, H, J lie on a straight line in some order, forming a straight line. But then angles wouldn't make sense unless there are intersections. 

Alternatively, maybe there are two intersecting lines creating vertical angles. For example, if lines EC and FH intersect at some point, creating vertical angles. But again, without knowing where the points are, it's hard to proceed.

This is really challenging without a diagram. But since this is a math problem, there must be a standard configuration. Let me think again about the angles given:

Angle EFC (at F): x + 20

Angle FCH (at C): x + 5

Angle CHJ (at H): x - 5

Angle HJE (at J): x + 10

These angles are at different vertices. Let me try to imagine a scenario where these angles are part of a polygon. If I consider the points E, F, C, H, J connected in order, forming a pentagon. Then the sum of the internal angles is 540 degrees. As before, but we only have four angles. Wait, but maybe there's another angle at E that we can derive. Let's denote that as y. So:

Total sum: (x+20) + (x+5) + (x-5) + (x+10) + y = 540

Which simplifies to 4x + 30 + y = 540 => y = 510 - 4x.

Now, if we can find another equation involving y and x, we can solve for x. Where could that come from? Maybe the angle at E is related to another angle through some property.

Wait, maybe the angle at E is part of another polygon or related to another angle via supplementary or complementary angles. For example, if there's a straight line passing through E, then the angle at E might be supplementary to another angle. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle at E is related to one of the other angles through triangle properties. For instance, if there's a triangle involving E and other points. 

Wait, let's think: If we have points E, F, C, H, J in a pentagon, then the angle at E (y) is between JE and EF. Now, if we consider triangle EFC, which includes angle at F (x+20), and possibly other angles. But without knowing more, this is still unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the angles at F, C, H, J are external angles of some polygon, but again, not sure.

Wait, here's a different approach: Assume that the figure is a pentagon, and that the angle at E is supplementary to another angle. For example, if line JE is extended beyond E, forming a straight line with FE, then angle at E would be a straight angle (180°), but that's just a guess.

Alternatively, maybe the angles given are the external angles of the pentagon. Wait, the sum of external angles of any polygon is 360°. But if that were the case, then:

External angles would be:

At F: 180° - (x + 20) ?

Wait, no. External angles are formed by extending one side. This is getting too vague.

Alternatively, think about the fact that if the figure is a pentagon, and we have expressions for four of its internal angles, and one unknown. But without another equation, we can't solve for x. Hence, my earlier assumption may be wrong.

Maybe the angles are not internal angles of a pentagon but rather angles in a different configuration. Let me try another angle: Suppose that these angles are part of a triangle. For example, if points E, F, C are connected, forming triangle EFC, with angle at F being x+20. Then angle FCH is at C, which would be an angle outside the triangle. But this is too vague.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the points form a series of triangles sharing sides. For example, triangle EFC, triangle FCH, triangle CHJ, triangle HJE. Each subsequent triangle shares a side with the previous one. In that case, the angles at each point could be related.

For example, in triangle EFC, angle at F is x+20. In triangle FCH, angle at C is x+5. In triangle CHJ, angle at H is x-5. In triangle HJE, angle at J is x+10. Then, what about the remaining angles in each triangle? For example, in triangle EFC, the other angles would be at E and C. Similarly for others. But without knowing the relations between these triangles, it's hard to proceed.

But if I assume that these triangles are connected such that each subsequent triangle shares a side with the previous one, then maybe the sum of angles at each point relates to the overall figure. 

Alternatively, think about the entire figure as a polygon where each angle is part of a triangle. 

But honestly, without a diagram, this is very challenging. Given that this is a math problem, and the answer choices are numerical, perhaps there's a standard setup. Let me try assuming that the given angles are the angles of a pentagon, and that the fifth angle is related to the rest somehow. 

Earlier, we had y = 510 - 4x. But we need another equation. Let me think: Maybe the angle at E is related to another angle through a straight line. For example, if the extension of JC passes through E, making a straight line, then angle at E plus some other angle equals 180. 

Alternatively, suppose that the angle at E is equal to the angle at J, but that's just guessing.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the figure is a pentagon with one of the angles being a reflex angle (greater than 180 degrees), but that complicates things further.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a triangle involving points E, H, and J. For example, if we consider triangle EHC or something. But again, without knowing the connections, this is speculative.

Wait, here's a different approach. Let's suppose that all the given angles are angles of a triangle. Wait, but there are four angles. No. Alternatively, maybe they are angles in a quadrilateral. Four angles, but again, sum would be 360. Let me try that. Suppose that the four angles are part of a quadrilateral. Sum is 360. So:

(x+20) + (x+5) + (x-5) + (x+10) = 4x + 30 = 360 → 4x = 330 → x=82.5. Then angle H is x-5 = 77.5. Which is not among the options. So this suggests that this assumption is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe three angles are part of a triangle. For example, if three of the angles are angles of a triangle, summing to 180. Let's take angle EFC (x+20), angle FCH (x+5), and angle HJE (x+10). Their sum would be 3x + 35 = 180 → 3x = 145 → x ≈ 48.33. Then angle H is x-5 ≈ 43.33, which is not matching the options either. So this is also unlikely.

Hmm. Another possibility: The given angles are angles in a triangle with some external angles. For example, using the exterior angle theorem. For instance, if angle at C (x+5) is an exterior angle for triangle EFC, then it would be equal to the sum of the remote interior angles. But again, without knowing which angles are which, it's hard to apply.

Wait, let's think about the possibility that the points form a star with intersecting lines, and the angles given are the ones at the tips of the star. For example, in a regular star pentagon (pentagram), each tip angle is 36 degrees. But this is too specific, and our angles depend on x.

Alternatively, maybe the angles are related through the concept of exterior angles. For example, if the sum of exterior angles is 360. But again, without knowing which angles are exterior, it's unclear.

I think I need to revisit the pentagon assumption. If we assume the pentagon, and that there's an error in my calculation. Let me recheck the sum of the angles. If we have four angles given and one unknown, and the total is 540, then:

Sum = (x+20) + (x+5) + (x-5) + (x+10) + y = 4x + 30 + y = 540 → y = 510 - 4x.

But how to get another equation? Maybe the angle y is related to one of the other angles through supplementary or something else. For example, if the angle at E is supplementary to another angle. 

Wait, suppose that the angle at E is part of a straight line with another angle. For instance, if line JE is extended past E to a point, forming a straight line with FE. Then, angle at E would be supplementary to another angle. But without knowing which, it's still unclear.

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involving points E, F, H. For example, if we consider triangle EFH. But again, without knowing the angles, this is guesswork.

Wait, let's try to think differently. What if the angles given are not internal angles of a pentagon but instead angles in a different configuration, like a triangle with a cevian. For example, if there's a triangle EFC with a cevian CH, creating smaller angles. But this is too vague.

Alternatively, maybe the points form a series of connected angles, like in a polygon with diagonals. 

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me think about the answer choices. The options are 97, 102, 107, 122. These numbers are close to 100, suggesting that x is around 100-something. Let me try plugging in the answer choices and see if I can find consistency.

Suppose m∠H is 102. Then x -5 = 102 → x = 107. Let's substitute x=107 into the other angles:

Angle at F: 107 + 20 = 127

Angle at C: 107 +5 = 112

Angle at H: 107 -5 = 102

Angle at J: 107 +10 = 117

If these are internal angles of a pentagon, then the fifth angle at E would be 540 - (127 + 112 + 102 + 117) = 540 - 458 = 82. So y=82. Is there a reason why this would be valid? Well, if the fifth angle is 82, but how does that help? Without more info, it's hard to say. But maybe this fits into some other condition.

Alternatively, if the sum of angles at E and another angle equals 180. For example, if the angle at E (82) and angle at J (117) add up to 199, which is not helpful. Or if there's a straight line involving angle at E and another angle.

Alternatively, if the angle at E is 82, and the angle at F is 127. Are these supplementary? 82 + 127 = 209, no. Not helpful.

Alternatively, if the angle at E (82) is part of a triangle with other angles. But without knowing, it's hard.

Alternatively, if the angles are part of a triangle with angle sums. For example, if there's a triangle involving points E, F, C. In triangle EFC, angles at F is 127, at C is 112. Wait, but in a triangle, the sum of angles is 180. But 127 + 112 = 239 > 180, which is impossible. So this suggests that x=107 is invalid. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

Similarly, trying another option. Let's pick option C: 107. So m∠H = 107 → x -5 = 107 → x = 112.

Substitute x=112:

Angle at F: 112 +20 = 132

Angle at C: 112 +5 = 117

Angle at H: 112 -5 = 107

Angle at J: 112 +10 = 122

Sum of these four angles: 132 + 117 + 107 + 122 = 132+117=249; 107+122=229; total 249+229=478. Total pentagon sum is 540, so angle at E would be 540 - 478 = 62. Again, not sure how this helps, but checking if these angles could form a triangle. For example, if there's a triangle with angles 132, 117, etc., but again, 132+117=249 > 180, impossible.

So this suggests that x cannot be 112. Let me try option B: 102. So m∠H = 102 → x-5=102 → x=107. Wait, this was the same as before. So that leads to the same issue.

Option A: 97 → x = 102.

Then angles:

F: 102+20=122

C: 102+5=107

H: 102-5=97

J: 102+10=112

Sum of these four: 122+107+97+112 = 122+107=229; 97+112=209; total 438. Then angle at E = 540 - 438 = 102. So angle at E is 102. Now, if there's a triangle with angles at E, F, and C? Let's see: angle at E is 102, angle at F is 122, angle at C is 107. Sum is 102+122+107=331 > 180, impossible. So again, invalid.

Option D: 122 → m∠H = 122 → x-5=122 → x=127.

Angles:

F: 127+20=147

C: 127+5=132

H: 127-5=122

J: 127+10=137

Sum of these four: 147+132+122+137 = 147+132=279; 122+137=259; total 538. Angle at E = 540 - 538 = 2. That's extremely small, probably not meaningful.

None of these seem to work. This suggests that my initial assumption about the pentagon is incorrect. So I must have misinterpreted the figure.

Let me try another approach. Suppose that the given angles are angles around a point. For example, if all these angles meet at a common point, their sum would be 360. Let's try that. Sum of given angles:

(x+20) + (x+5) + (x-5) + (x+10) = 4x + 20 +5 -5 +10 = 4x +30. Set equal to 360:

4x +30 = 360 → 4x = 330 → x=82.5. Then m∠H = x-5 = 77.5, which is not among the options. So this is invalid.

Alternatively, maybe three of the angles form a straight line. For example, angle at F + angle at C + angle at H = 180. Let's try:

(x+20) + (x+5) + (x-5) = 3x +20 = 180 → 3x=160 → x=53.33... Then m∠H = 53.33 -5 = 48.33, not matching options.

Alternatively, angle at C + angle at H + angle at J = 180:

(x+5) + (x-5) + (x+10) = 3x +10 = 180 → 3x=170 → x≈56.67. m∠H = 56.67-5=51.67. Still not matching.

Another idea: Maybe the angles are part of a triangle with some external angles. For example, if angle at F is an exterior angle, equal to sum of remote interior angles. Let's assume that angle at F (x+20) is an exterior angle for a triangle. Then it would equal the sum of the other two angles. But which ones? Let's say it's exterior to triangle FCH. Then x+20 = angle at C + angle at H. But angle at C is x+5, angle at H is x-5. So x+20 = (x+5)+(x-5) → x+20 = 2x → x=20. Then m∠H = 20-5=15, which is not in options.

Alternatively, if angle at C is an exterior angle, equal to sum of remote angles. Suppose angle at C (x+5) is exterior, so equals sum of angles at F and J. So x+5 = (x+20) + (x+10) → x+5 = 2x +30 → -x = 25 → x=-25. Negative angle, invalid.

Hmm. This isn't working. Maybe the angles are part of a different configuration. Let me think about a transversal cutting through parallel lines. For example, if lines EH and CJ are parallel, then corresponding angles could be equal. But without knowing which lines are parallel, this is too vague.

Wait, here's a new idea: Maybe the points form a triangle with some cevians. For example, triangle EJC with cevians FC and HJ. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's difficult.

Wait, perhaps the angles are part of a triangle with two cevians. For example, in triangle EFC, with a cevian CH, creating angles at C. But this is too vague.

At this point, I'm stuck. Given that none of the assumptions are working, perhaps there's a different approach. Let me think about the original problem again. The question is to find m∠H, which is given as x-5. So if I can find x, I can calculate it. To find x, I need to find a relationship between the given angles. 

Perhaps the key is to realize that the angles form a closed figure, and the sum of certain angles equals 180 or 360. Let me try adding up all the given angles:

(x+20) + (x+5) + (x-5) + (x+10) = 4x + 30. 

If this represents the sum of angles around a point, it should be 360, giving x=82.5, but that doesn't help. If it represents the sum of angles in a triangle, 4x+30=180 → x=37.5, leading to m∠H=32.5, which is not in options.

Alternatively, if this sum is part of a larger polygon. For example, if it's part of a hexagon, but that's too many variables.

Wait, maybe the angles are alternate interior angles or something. For example, if two lines are cut by a transversal, creating equal angles. But again, without knowing which lines are parallel, this is guesswork.

Wait, here's a different idea: Let's assume that the points form a pentagon where each angle is part of a triangle. For example, each angle is part of a triangle with other points. But without knowing, it's too vague.

Alternatively, think about the fact that the angles given are angles of a triangle. For example, if three of them are angles of a triangle, and the fourth is supplementary to one of them. Let's say angle at F, C, and J are angles of a triangle. Their sum would be 180:

(x+20) + (x+5) + (x+10) = 3x +35 = 180 → 3x = 145 → x = 145/3 ≈ 48.33. Then m∠H = x-5 ≈ 43.33, not in options.

Alternatively, if two of the angles are supplementary to others. For example, angle at F + angle at C = 180. So x+20 + x+5 = 2x +25 = 180 → 2x = 155 → x=77.5. Then m∠H = 77.5 -5 = 72.5, not in options.

This is frustrating. Maybe I need to consider that the angles are not all internal angles of a single polygon but are part of different polygons. For example, some angles are in one polygon, others in another.

Wait, let me try this: Assume that the points form a triangle with a cevian, creating smaller triangles. For example, in triangle EFC, with a cevian CH, creating triangle FCH. Then, in triangle FCH, angle at C is x+5, and in triangle EFC, angle at F is x+20. If these triangles share side FC, then maybe there's a relation between their angles. 

But without knowing the other angles in these triangles, it's hard to proceed. For example, in triangle EFC, the other angles would be at E and C. If we knew those, we could relate them to other angles. But we don't.

Alternatively, if there's a triangle involving H and J. For example, in triangle HJE, angle at J is x+10, and angle at H is x-5. If we knew another angle, we could find x. But again, missing info.

Wait, here's a thought: Maybe the angles given are angles of a triangle with some of its exterior angles. For example, if angle at F is an exterior angle, equal to the sum of two remote interior angles. Let's say angle at F (x+20) is an exterior angle to triangle HJC. Then x+20 = angle at J + angle at C. Angle at J is x+10, angle at C is x+5. So x+20 = (x+10) + (x+5) → x+20 = 2x +15 → x=5. Then m∠H = x-5 = 0, which is invalid.

Alternatively, if angle at H is an exterior angle. Suppose angle at H (x-5) is an exterior angle to triangle FCH. Then x-5 = angle at F + angle at C. Angle at F is x+20, angle at C is x+5. So x-5 = (x+20) + (x+5) → x-5 = 2x +25 → -x = 30 → x = -30. Invalid.

No luck.

At this point, I've tried numerous approaches without success. Given that, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that the given angles are part of a pentagon, and that the fifth angle is equal to one of the given angles, leading to an equation. Let's try that. For example, if the angle at E is equal to angle at J (x+10). Then y = x+10. Substituting into the pentagon equation:

4x +30 + y = 540 → 4x +30 + x +10 = 540 → 5x +40 = 540 → 5x = 500 → x=100. Then m∠H = x-5 = 95. Close to option A (97), but not quite. Maybe this is the intended approach, but there's a miscalculation.

Wait, let's check: If angle at E is equal to angle at J, then y = x+10. Then:

4x +30 + x +10 = 5x +40 = 540 → x=100. Then m∠H = 100-5=95. Not in options. Closest is A:97. Maybe there's a rounding error or a different assumption.

Alternatively, if the angle at E is equal to angle at F. So y = x+20. Then:

4x +30 + x +20 = 5x +50 = 540 → 5x=490 → x=98. Then m∠H = 98-5=93. Still not matching.

Alternatively, if angle at E is equal to angle at C. So y = x+5. Then 4x +30 + x +5 = 5x +35 = 540 → 5x=505 → x=101. m∠H = 101-5=96. Still not matching.

Alternatively, if angle at E is equal to angle at H. So y = x-5. Then:

4x +30 + x-5 = 5x +25 = 540 → 5x=515 → x=103. m∠H = 103-5=98. Still not matching.

Alternatively, if angle at E is supplementary to angle at J. So y + (x+10) = 180 → y = 170 -x. Substituting into pentagon equation:

4x +30 + 170 -x = 3x +200 = 540 → 3x = 340 → x=113.33. m∠H = 113.33 -5 = 108.33. Close to option C (107).

This suggests that x is approximately 113.33, leading to m∠H ≈108.33, which is close to 107 (option C). Maybe due to rounding or a different assumption.

Given that, and considering the options, the closest is option C: 107. So perhaps the intended answer is C.

But this is purely speculative. Since I can't find a precise derivation, but the closest approximation is 107, I'll choose option C.
