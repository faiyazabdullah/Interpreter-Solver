Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have several RightAngle predicates. So Angle(B,E,D) is a right angle, and Angle(E,B,C) is also a right angle. That suggests there might be some perpendicular lines here. Then we have Isosceles triangles: Triangle(D,E,A) and Triangle(D,A,C). So those two triangles have two equal sides each. 

Next, there are some length equalities. Length of Line(D,B) is 26 units, Line(B,C) is 18 units, Line(D,E) is 8 units, and Line(E,A) is 10 units. We need to find the length of Line(A,C), which is denoted as x. Also, there are points lying on lines: Point A lies on Line(D,C), E lies on Line(D,B) and Line(B,C). Additionally, the sum of the measures of Angles(D,E,A) and (A,E,C) equals 90 degrees. 

Let me try to visualize this. Maybe drawing a diagram would help, but since I can't draw, I'll imagine it. Points D, E, B, C, A are involved. Since E lies on Line(D,B) and Line(B,C), that means E is the intersection point of Lines D,B and B,C? Wait, but if E is on Line(D,B) and also on Line(B,C), then B, E, and C are colinear? Because Line(B,C) passes through B and C. But E is on Line(B,C), so E is somewhere along BC. However, E is also on Line(D,B), so that implies that E is at the intersection of D-B and B-C. Therefore, B-E-C are colinear, and D-E-B are colinear? Wait, because E is on Line(D,B), so D-E-B are colinear. So, points D, E, B are on one line, and B, E, C are on another line. Wait, but if E is on both lines, then those two lines intersect at E. So D-E-B is one line, and B-E-C is another line, making angle at E between D-E-B and B-E-C. But since there's a right angle at E for Angle(E,B,C), which is the angle at B between E and C. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify.

First, the RightAngle(Angle(B,E,D)) means that at point E, the angle between BE and ED is a right angle. Wait, no. The angle is written as Angle(B,E,D), which means vertex at E, with segments EB and ED forming the angle. So that's a right angle at E between BE and ED. Similarly, RightAngle(Angle(E,B,C)) is the angle at B between EB and BC, so that's a right angle at B between EB and BC. 

So, from this, we can deduce that at point B, the angle between EB and BC is 90 degrees. And at point E, the angle between EB and ED is 90 degrees. So that suggests that ED is perpendicular to EB, and BC is perpendicular to EB. Which would mean that ED and BC are both perpendicular to EB, implying that ED is parallel to BC? Wait, if two lines are both perpendicular to the same line, they are parallel. So ED || BC?

But let me confirm. If EB is a common side, and ED ⊥ EB, and BC ⊥ EB, then yes, ED and BC are both perpendicular to EB, hence parallel. So ED || BC.

Now, looking at the Isosceles triangles. Triangle(D,E,A) is isosceles. So either DE = EA, or DE = DA, or EA = DA. Similarly, Triangle(D,A,C) is isosceles, so DA = DC, or DA = AC, or DC = AC. 

Given that Length(D,E) is 8, Length(E,A) is 10. So in Triangle(D,E,A), DE = 8, EA = 10. For it to be isosceles, either DE = EA (which would mean 8=10, impossible), or DE = DA, or EA = DA. So DA must be equal to either DE or EA. Since DE is 8, EA is 10, then DA could be 8 or 10. But we don't know yet. 

Similarly, Triangle(D,A,C) is isosceles. We know DA is something, DC is something, and AC is x. 

Also, Point A lies on Line(D,C). So A is somewhere on the line connecting D and C. 

Additionally, the sum of angles at E: Measure(Angle(D,E,A)) + Measure(Angle(A,E,C)) = 90 degrees. Let me note that. 

Let me try to map out coordinates. Sometimes assigning coordinates helps. Let me place point B at origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since there are right angles at B and E, perhaps coordinate system can simplify things. 

Since RightAngle at B for Angle(E,B,C): So EB and BC are perpendicular. Let me assume B is at (0,0). Let me suppose that EB is along the y-axis and BC is along the x-axis. So point E is along the y-axis, and point C is along the x-axis. 

Wait, but E lies on Line(D,B) and Line(B,C). So Line(D,B) passes through E and B, so if B is at (0,0), and E is on Line(D,B), then D is somewhere along the line extending from B through E. 

But since there's a right angle at E between BE and ED, which would mean that ED is perpendicular to BE. If BE is along the y-axis (from B(0,0) to E(0,e)), then ED would be horizontal (along x-axis) from E(0,e) to D(d, e)? Wait, but ED is perpendicular to BE. If BE is vertical, then ED should be horizontal. So if E is at (0, e), then D would be at (d, e), such that ED is horizontal. 

Alternatively, maybe better to assign coordinates more carefully. Let me proceed step by step.

Let me set up coordinate system:

Let’s take point B at (0,0).

Since there's a right angle at B between EB and BC. Let me assume that BE is vertical and BC is horizontal. So point E is along the positive y-axis from B, and point C is along the positive x-axis from B.

Therefore, coordinates:

B = (0, 0)

E = (0, e) for some e.

C = (c, 0) for some c.

Now, since E lies on Line(D,B). So Line(D,B) connects points D and B. Since E is on that line, and B is (0,0), E is (0,e), then Line(D,B) is the vertical line passing through B and E. Hence, D must lie on the same vertical line. So D has coordinates (0, d) where d ≠ 0. But wait, since E is on Line(D,B), then D, E, B are colinear. Since B is (0,0) and E is (0,e), then D must be another point on the same vertical line. Suppose D is above or below E. Given that Length(D,E) is 8. So distance between D and E is 8. Let's say D is at (0, e + k), so that |k| = 8. But direction depends on where D is located. Let me think about the rest of the problem.

Also, from the Isosceles Triangle(D,E,A). Let me consider that. Also, Point A lies on Line(D,C). So once I define coordinates for D and C, I can find A accordingly.

Also, Length(D,E) is 8. Since D and E are on the same vertical line (x=0), their coordinates are D=(0, y_D) and E=(0, y_E). So the distance between them is |y_D - y_E| = 8. Let me denote y_E as e, so y_D = e ± 8. Depending on whether D is above or below E. Let's tentatively assume D is above E, so y_D = e + 8. Or maybe not; but we can adjust later.

Also, we have Length(E,A) is 10. So point A is connected to E with length 10. Also, Triangle(D,E,A) is isosceles. So sides DE, EA, DA. DE is 8, EA is 10. So for triangle DEA to be isosceles, either DE=DA (so DA=8), or DE=EA (but 8≠10, so no), or EA=DA (so DA=10). 

So DA must be either 8 or 10. Let me keep that in mind.

Also, Point A lies on Line(D,C). So once we define coordinates for D and C, we can parametrize A.

Let me first handle the coordinates for C. From earlier, we had C on the x-axis at (c, 0). Also, Length(B,C) is 18. Since B is at (0,0), then distance from B to C is sqrt((c-0)^2 + (0-0)^2) = |c|. So |c|=18. Assuming standard orientation, c=18, so C is at (18, 0).

Thus, C = (18, 0).

Now, we need to find coordinates for D. Earlier, we said D is on the same vertical line as B and E, which is the y-axis. So D is at (0, y_D). Also, the distance between D and E is 8. Since E is at (0, e), then |y_D - e| = 8. So y_D = e ± 8. Let me assume that D is above E, so y_D = e + 8. Alternatively, if D is below E, then y_D = e - 8. But without loss of generality, maybe we can choose directions. However, we need to see how this affects other parts.

Also, we have another isosceles triangle: Triangle(D,A,C). So DA, DC, AC. Need to check which sides are equal. Also, A is on Line(D,C). Let me parametrize point A.

Since A is on Line(D,C). Let me write the equation for Line(D,C). Coordinates of D: (0, y_D), coordinates of C: (18, 0). So parametric equations for Line(D,C) can be expressed as follows. Let me parameterize it with parameter t. Starting at D (0, y_D) and moving towards C (18, 0). The vector from D to C is (18 - 0, 0 - y_D) = (18, -y_D). So any point on Line(D,C) can be written as (0 + 18t, y_D - y_D t), where t ∈ [0,1] gives the segment DC, but A can be anywhere on the line extended beyond.

But since we don't know where A is, except that it's on Line(D,C), and that Triangle(D,E,A) is isosceles. Also, Length(E,A)=10. So point A is somewhere such that distance from E to A is 10.

Let me attempt to express coordinates of A. Let me denote A as (x_A, y_A). Since A lies on Line(D,C), which goes from D(0, y_D) to C(18, 0). So parametric equations can be represented as:

x = 18t

y = y_D - y_D t, where t is a real number.

Wait, actually, the parametric form starting from D: when t=0, we are at D (0, y_D); when t=1, we are at C (18, 0). So general point on DC is (18t, y_D - y_D t). So coordinates of A are (18t, y_D(1 - t)).

But maybe another way: Let me use parameters. Let me denote the coordinates of A as (a_x, a_y), lying on Line(D,C). So the slope of DC is (0 - y_D)/(18 - 0) = (-y_D)/18. Thus, the equation of Line(D,C) is y - y_D = (-y_D / 18)(x - 0), so y = (-y_D / 18)x + y_D.

Therefore, for any point A on DC, its coordinates satisfy this equation.

Now, we also know that Distance(E, A) = 10. E is at (0, e). So distance between E(0,e) and A(a_x, a_y) is sqrt[(a_x - 0)^2 + (a_y - e)^2] = 10. Squared, that's (a_x)^2 + (a_y - e)^2 = 100.

Also, since A lies on DC, we have a_y = (-y_D / 18)a_x + y_D.

Substituting that into the previous equation:

a_x^2 + [(-y_D / 18 a_x + y_D) - e]^2 = 100.

This seems complicated, but maybe we can find relations between variables.

But perhaps there's another way. Let me recall that Triangle(D,E,A) is isosceles. So possibilities:

Case 1: DE = DA → DE = 8, so DA = 8.

Case 2: EA = DA → EA = 10, so DA = 10.

Case 3: DE = EA → Not possible as 8 ≠ 10.

So depending on which case holds, we can find coordinates of A.

Let me explore Case 1: DA = 8. So distance from D to A is 8. D is at (0, y_D). A is at (a_x, a_y). Then:

sqrt[(a_x - 0)^2 + (a_y - y_D)^2] = 8 → squared: a_x² + (a_y - y_D)^2 = 64.

But we also have from the distance from E to A being 10:

a_x² + (a_y - e)^2 = 100.

And from A lying on DC: a_y = (-y_D / 18)a_x + y_D.

So substituting a_y into both equations:

From DA = 8: a_x² + [(-y_D / 18 a_x + y_D) - y_D]^2 = a_x² + [ - y_D / 18 a_x ]² = a_x² + (y_D² / 324)a_x² = 64.

Factor out a_x²: a_x² [1 + (y_D²)/324] = 64.

Similarly, from EA = 10: a_x² + [(-y_D / 18 a_x + y_D) - e]^2 = 100.

Expanding the second term:

[ - y_D / 18 a_x + y_D - e ]² = [ y_D - e - (y_D / 18)a_x ]².

This seems messy. Perhaps there's another approach. Let me think.

Alternatively, since A lies on DC, maybe we can find coordinates of A in terms of t, then compute distances.

Let me parametrize A as follows. Let me use parameter t such that A divides DC in ratio t:(1-t), but not sure. Alternatively, using the parametric expressions.

Earlier, I had A as (18t, y_D(1 - t)). So a_x = 18t, a_y = y_D(1 - t).

Then, distance from E(0,e) to A is sqrt[(18t - 0)^2 + (y_D(1 - t) - e)^2] = 10.

So squaring:

(18t)^2 + [y_D(1 - t) - e]^2 = 100.

Also, distance DA is sqrt[(18t - 0)^2 + (y_D(1 - t) - y_D)^2] = sqrt[(18t)^2 + (- y_D t)^2] = sqrt[ (324 t²) + (y_D² t²) ) ] = t * sqrt(324 + y_D²).

In Case 1, DA = 8, so:

t * sqrt(324 + y_D²) = 8 → t = 8 / sqrt(324 + y_D²).

But also, from the EA equation:

(18t)^2 + [y_D(1 - t) - e]^2 = 100.

Substituting t from above may be complex. Let me see if I can find relations between y_D and e.

Recall that there's a right angle at E between BE and ED. Since BE is from B(0,0) to E(0,e), which is vertical. ED is from E(0,e) to D(0,y_D), which is vertical as well. Wait, that would make angle at E between BE and ED zero degrees, since both are vertical lines. But that contradicts the given RightAngle(Angle(B,E,D)). Wait, this suggests a mistake in my setup.

Hold on! This indicates that my assumption about the position of D is incorrect. Because if both BE and ED are vertical lines (since E is on vertical line BE and D is on same vertical line), then the angle at E between BE and ED would be straight line, i.e., 180 degrees, not a right angle. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, my initial assumption about the coordinates is wrong.

Ah, here's the error. Earlier, I thought that since E lies on Line(D,B), which is the line through D and B, and since B is at (0,0) and E is on that line, but I assumed that D is vertically aligned with B and E. However, the RightAngle(Angle(B,E,D)) implies that angle at E between BE and ED is 90 degrees. Therefore, vectors EB and ED must be perpendicular. 

So if EB is from E to B, and ED is from E to D, these vectors must be perpendicular. 

Let me re-examine the coordinate setup. Let me place B at (0,0). Let me assume that point E is at (e_x, e_y). Then vector EB is B - E = (0 - e_x, 0 - e_y) = (-e_x, -e_y). Vector ED is D - E = (d_x - e_x, d_y - e_y). These vectors must be perpendicular, so their dot product is zero:

(-e_x)(d_x - e_x) + (-e_y)(d_y - e_y) = 0  
=> -e_x d_x + e_x² - e_y d_y + e_y² = 0  
=> e_x² + e_y² = e_x d_x + e_y d_y  

But this seems too abstract. Maybe choosing coordinates more strategically.

Alternative approach: Let me consider that since there are two right angles at E and B, perhaps setting coordinates so that these conditions are satisfied.

Let me try again. Let me place point E at the origin (0,0) to simplify. Then, since there's a right angle at E between BE and ED, I can align BE and ED as perpendicular axes.

Let me set E at (0,0). Let me take BE along the x-axis and ED along the y-axis. So point B is somewhere along the x-axis, and point D is somewhere along the y-axis. 

So:

- Point E: (0,0)
- Point B: (b, 0) for some b > 0 (since BE is along x-axis)
- Point D: (0, d) for some d > 0 (since ED is along y-axis)

Now, since there's a right angle at B between EB and BC. EB is from B to E, which is from (b,0) to (0,0), vector (-b, 0). BC is from B to C, which needs to be perpendicular to EB. Since EB is along negative x-axis, BC must be along positive or negative y-axis. But since angle at B is between BE and BC, and it's a right angle, so BC is perpendicular to BE. 

Assuming standard orientation, let me take BC along positive y-axis. So from B(b, 0), moving upward along y-axis. So point C is at (b, c) for some c > 0. 

So now:

- B: (b, 0)
- E: (0, 0)
- D: (0, d)
- C: (b, c)

Now, we know certain lengths:

Length(D,E) is 8. Since D is (0,d) and E is (0,0), the distance is |d - 0| = |d| = 8 ⇒ d = 8 (assuming upwards).

Length(E,A) is 10. Point A is somewhere. Also, A lies on Line(D,C). Let me find coordinates of Line(D,C). D is (0,8), C is (b, c). So parametric equations for Line(D,C):

Parametric form: starting at D(0,8) going to C(b,c). So parametric equations can be expressed as:

x = 0 + tb, 
y = 8 + t(c - 8), where t ∈ ℝ.

So any point A on Line(D,C) can be written as (tb, 8 + t(c - 8)).

Also, since A lies on Line(D,C), and we need to find coordinates of A such that distance from E(0,0) to A is 10. So:

Distance EA = sqrt[(tb - 0)^2 + (8 + t(c - 8) - 0)^2] = sqrt[t²b² + (8 + t(c - 8))²] = 10.

Square both sides: t²b² + [8 + t(c - 8)]² = 100.

Also, Triangle(D,E,A) is isosceles. Let's analyze that. Points D(0,8), E(0,0), A(tb, 8 + t(c-8)).

Compute lengths of sides:

DE: already known as 8.

EA: 10.

DA: distance between D(0,8) and A(tb, 8 + t(c-8)):

sqrt[(tb - 0)^2 + (8 + t(c-8) - 8)^2] = sqrt[t²b² + t²(c - 8)^2] = t * sqrt(b² + (c - 8)^2).

For triangle DEA to be isosceles, either:

1. DE = DA → 8 = t * sqrt(b² + (c - 8)^2)

2. DE = EA → 8 = 10 → impossible.

3. EA = DA → 10 = t * sqrt(b² + (c - 8)^2)

So either case 1 or 3 applies.

Also, from the other given: Length(B,C) is 18. Since B is (b,0) and C is (b,c), the distance BC is sqrt[(b - b)^2 + (c - 0)^2] = |c| = 18 ⇒ c = 18.

So c = 18. Now, we can substitute c = 18 into the equations.

So now, Line(D,C) is from D(0,8) to C(b,18). Parametric equations:

x = tb,

y = 8 + t(18 - 8) = 8 + 10t.

So point A is (tb, 8 + 10t).

Now, back to the equations:

From EA distance:

t²b² + [8 + 10t]^2 = 100.

And from DA length:

Either case 1 or 3.

Let me handle both cases.

Case 1: DE = DA → 8 = t * sqrt(b² + (18 - 8)^2) = t * sqrt(b² + 100)

So t = 8 / sqrt(b² + 100)

Plugging this into the EA equation:

t²b² + [8 + 10t]^2 = 100.

Let me substitute t:

[ (64)/(b² + 100) ) * b² ] + [8 + 10*(8 / sqrt(b² + 100))]^2 = 100.

This looks complex. Let me see if there's another relation involving b.

We also know that there's another isosceles triangle: Triangle(D,A,C) is isosceles. Let me analyze that.

Points D(0,8), A(tb, 8+10t), C(b,18).

So sides DA, AC, DC.

We need to determine which sides are equal. 

First, compute DC length: distance between D(0,8) and C(b,18) is sqrt[(b - 0)^2 + (18 - 8)^2] = sqrt(b² + 100).

AC length: distance between A(tb, 8+10t) and C(b,18):

sqrt[(b - tb)^2 + (18 - (8 + 10t))^2] = sqrt[ b²(1 - t)^2 + (10 - 10t)^2 ]

= sqrt[ b²(1 - t)^2 + 100(1 - t)^2 ]

= sqrt[ (b² + 100)(1 - t)^2 ) ]

= |1 - t| * sqrt(b² + 100)

So AC = |1 - t| * sqrt(b² + 100)

DA was previously found as t * sqrt(b² + 100)

DC is sqrt(b² + 100)

So for Triangle(D,A,C) to be isosceles, either:

- DA = DC → t * sqrt(...) = sqrt(...), so t = 1 → but then A would be at C, but then DA would be DC, but then EA would be... Hmm, but if t=1, then A=C. Then distance from E to A would be EC, which is distance from E(0,0) to C(b,18) is sqrt(b² + 324). But given that EA is supposed to be 10, so sqrt(b² + 324) = 10 → b² + 324 = 100 → b² = -224, which is impossible. So t cannot be 1.

Or DA = AC → t * sqrt(...) = |1 - t| * sqrt(...), so t = |1 - t|. Which gives t = 1 - t → 2t = 1 → t = 1/2, or t = -(1 - t) → t = -1 + t → 0 = -1, which is impossible. So t = 1/2.

OR DC = AC → sqrt(b² + 100) = |1 - t| * sqrt(b² + 100) → |1 - t| = 1 → t = 0 or t = 2.

If t=0, then A is at D(0,8). Then EA is distance from E(0,0) to D(0,8) is 8, but given that EA is 10 → contradiction. If t=2, then A is at (2b, 8 + 10*2) = (2b, 28). Then distance from E to A is sqrt[(2b)^2 + 28^2]. Set this equal to 10: 4b² + 784 = 100 → 4b² = -684 → invalid. So DC = AC case leads to no solution unless b is imaginary. Hence, this case is invalid. Therefore, only possibility is DA = AC, leading to t = 1/2.

So if DA = AC, then t = 1/2. Let me check that.

If t = 1/2, then:

Coordinates of A are ( (b/2), 8 + 10*(1/2) ) = (b/2, 13).

Then DA is distance from D(0,8) to A(b/2, 13): sqrt[(b/2)^2 + (13 - 8)^2] = sqrt( b²/4 + 25 )

AC is distance from A(b/2,13) to C(b,18): sqrt[(b - b/2)^2 + (18 - 13)^2] = sqrt( (b/2)^2 + 5² ) = same as DA. So indeed DA = AC, satisfying the isosceles condition.

So this case is valid. Thus, t = 1/2.

Now, plugging t = 1/2 into the EA equation:

t²b² + [8 + 10t]^2 = 100.

With t = 1/2:

( (1/2)^2 )b² + [8 + 10*(1/2)]^2 = 100  
→ (1/4)b² + (8 + 5)^2 = 100  
→ (1/4)b² + 13² = 100  
→ (1/4)b² + 169 = 100  
→ (1/4)b² = -69  
Which is impossible. So this suggests inconsistency. What did I do wrong?

Wait, this implies that assuming DA = AC leads to contradiction. So maybe my earlier assumption about the isosceles triangle is wrong. Let me re-examine.

Triangle(D,A,C) is isosceles. So it could be DA = DC, DA = AC, or DC = AC. Earlier, DA = AC gave us t = 1/2, which led to inconsistency. DA = DC would require t = 1, which was invalid. DC = AC requires |1 - t| = 1, which also led to contradictions. So maybe there's a miscalculation here.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation for t = 1/2.

When t = 1/2:

The EA distance equation is:

( (1/2)^2 )b² + [8 + 10*(1/2)]^2 = ?

Which is (1/4)b² + (8 + 5)^2 = (1/4)b² + 169 = 100 → (1/4)b² = -69 → impossible. So no solution here. So this suggests that our assumption that DA = AC is invalid, or there's an error in earlier steps.

Hmm. Let me go back. Perhaps I made a mistake in determining which sides are equal in the isosceles triangle. Let me re-express the triangle.

Triangle(D,A,C): vertices D(0,8), A(tb, 8 + 10t), C(b,18).

Possible equal sides:

1. DA = DC: DA = sqrt(b² + 100), DC is sqrt(b² + 100). So DA = DC always. Wait, that's true! Because DA is the distance from D to A, which we computed earlier as t * sqrt(b² + 100), while DC is sqrt(b² + 100). So if DA = DC, then t = 1. But earlier, when t=1, A coincides with C, which causes EA to be sqrt(b² + 18²) = 10 → b² + 324 = 100 → b² = -224, which is impossible. Hence, this case is invalid. 

Wait, but why is DA equal to DC? Wait, no. Wait, DA is t * sqrt(b² + 100), and DC is sqrt(b² + 100). So DA = DC iff t = 1. But this leads to contradiction. So this case is invalid.

Another possibility: DA = AC. As before, which leads to t = 1/2, but that leads to contradiction. Or AC = DC. Which would imply |1 - t| * sqrt(b² + 100) = sqrt(b² + 100) → |1 - t| = 1 → t=0 or t=2. As before, t=0 leads to A=D, which gives EA = 8, but given as 10. t=2 leads to A outside, but results in impossible b². Hence, no solution.

So what's wrong here? It seems like there's no solution under current assumptions. Which suggests that my coordinate setup might still be flawed, or there's an alternative configuration.

Wait, let me revisit the assumption about the position of D. Earlier, I placed D at (0,d) because I thought ED is along y-axis, but that might not be the case. Let me reconsider the placement of points.

Let me try a different coordinate setup. Let me take E at origin (0,0), as before. Since there's a right angle at E between BE and ED, let me take BE along x-axis and ED along y-axis. So:

- E: (0,0)
- B: (b, 0) for some b
- D: (0, d) for some d

Then, BC is perpendicular to BE (which is along x-axis), so BC is vertical. So from B(b, 0), moving up or down. Let's take it upwards, so C is at (b, c) for some c.

Now, given that Length(D,E) = 8. Since D is (0,d) and E is (0,0), distance is |d| = 8 → d = 8 or -8. Assume d = 8.

Length(B,C) is 18. Since B is (b,0) and C is (b,c), distance is |c| = 18 → c = 18.

So C is (b,18).

Now, point A is on Line(D,C). D is (0,8), C is (b,18). Parametric equations for Line(D,C): from D(0,8) to C(b,18). So parametric equations can be written as:

x = 0 + tb, y = 8 + t(18 - 8) = 8 + 10t, where t ∈ [0,1] for the segment, but possibly extended.

Now, distance from E(0,0) to A(tb, 8 + 10t) is 10. So:

√[(tb)^2 + (8 + 10t)^2] = 10 → square both sides: t²b² + (8 + 10t)^2 = 100.

Also, Triangle(D,E,A) is isosceles. Let's calculate DA and EA.

DA is distance from D(0,8) to A(tb, 8 + 10t):

√[(tb - 0)^2 + (8 + 10t - 8)^2] = √[t²b² + (10t)^2] = t√(b² + 100).

EA is 10, as given.

So for triangle DEA to be isosceles, either:

1. DE = DA → 8 = t√(b² + 100)

2. DE = EA → 8 = 10 → impossible.

3. DA = EA → t√(b² + 100) = 10.

So either case 1 or 3.

Let me explore both.

Case 1: 8 = t√(b² + 100) → t = 8 / √(b² + 100).

Plug into the EA equation:

t²b² + (8 + 10t)^2 = 100.

Substitute t:

(64/(b² + 100)) * b² + [8 + 10*(8 / √(b² + 100))]^2 = 100.

This seems complex, but let me try to simplify.

Let me denote s = √(b² + 100). Then t = 8/s.

So the equation becomes:

(64/s²)*b² + [8 + 80/s]^2 = 100.

But since s² = b² + 100, so b² = s² - 100.

Substitute:

(64/(s²))*(s² - 100) + [8 + 80/s]^2 = 100  
→ 64*(1 - 100/s²) + [8 + 80/s]^2 = 100.

Expand the second term:

[8 + 80/s]^2 = 64 + 1280/s + 6400/s².

So total equation:

64 - 6400/s² + 64 + 1280/s + 6400/s² = 100  
→ 64 + 64 + 1280/s = 100  
→ 128 + 1280/s = 100  
→ 1280/s = -28  
→ s = 1280 / (-28) = -45.714... 

But s is defined as √(b² + 100), which is positive. So this leads to a negative s, which is impossible. Hence, no solution in this case.

Case 3: DA = EA → t√(b² + 100) = 10 → t = 10 / √(b² + 100).

Plugging into the EA equation:

t²b² + (8 + 10t)^2 = 100.

Again, let me use s = √(b² + 100), so t = 10/s.

Equation becomes:

(100/s²)*b² + [8 + 10*(10/s)]^2 = 100.

Again, b² = s² - 100.

Substitute:

(100/s²)*(s² - 100) + [8 + 100/s]^2 = 100  
→ 100 - 10000/s² + 64 + 1600/s + 10000/s² = 100  
→ 100 + 64 + 1600/s = 100  
→ 164 + 1600/s = 100  
→ 1600/s = -64  
→ s = 1600 / (-64) = -25.

Again, s is positive, so no solution. Thus, both cases lead to contradictions. This suggests there is a flaw in the coordinate setup.

Perhaps my assumption about the direction of BC is incorrect. Let me try taking BC in the opposite direction, i.e., downward from B. So if B is at (b,0), then C is at (b,-18). Let me try this.

So C is at (b, -18). Then, Length(B,C) is | -18 - 0 | = 18, which fits. Now, recalculating.

Point C is (b, -18). Line(D,C) is from D(0,8) to C(b, -18). Parametric equations for Line(D,C):

x = tb, y = 8 + t*(-18 - 8) = 8 - 26t.

So point A is (tb, 8 - 26t).

Distance from E(0,0) to A is sqrt[(tb)^2 + (8 - 26t)^2] = 10 → squared: t²b² + (8 - 26t)^2 = 100.

Also, DA is distance from D(0,8) to A(tb, 8 - 26t): sqrt[(tb)^2 + (8 - 26t - 8)^2] = sqrt[t²b² + (-26t)^2] = t * sqrt(b² + 676).

For Triangle(DEA) to be isosceles, either DE = DA (8 = t * sqrt(b² + 676)), DE = EA (impossible), or DA = EA (t * sqrt(b² + 676) = 10).

Let me try case DA = EA: t * sqrt(b² + 676) = 10 → t = 10 / sqrt(b² + 676).

Plugging into the EA equation:

t²b² + (8 - 26t)^2 = 100.

Substituting t:

(100/(b² + 676)) * b² + [8 - 26*(10 / sqrt(b² + 676))]^2 = 100.

Let me denote s = sqrt(b² + 676), so t = 10/s.

Then, b² = s² - 676.

Substituting into the equation:

(100/s²)(s² - 676) + [8 - 260/s]^2 = 100  
→ 100 - 67600/s² + 64 - 4160/s + 67600/s² = 100  
→ 100 + 64 - 4160/s = 100  
→ 164 - 4160/s = 100  
→ 4160/s = 64  
→ s = 4160 / 64 = 65.

So s = 65. Recall that s = sqrt(b² + 676) = 65 → b² + 676 = 65² → b² = 4225 - 676 = 3549 → b = sqrt(3549). Let me check if this is possible. Well, it's a valid value.

Now, with s = 65, we can find t = 10/s = 10/65 = 2/13.

So t = 2/13.

Now, let's verify the other condition: Triangle(D,A,C) is isosceles.

Points D(0,8), A(tb, 8 - 26t), C(b, -18).

Compute lengths DA, AC, DC.

DA: already computed as 10 (since DA = EA = 10).

DC: distance from D(0,8) to C(b, -18): sqrt[b² + (-18 - 8)^2] = sqrt(b² + 676) = s = 65.

AC: distance from A to C: sqrt[(b - tb)^2 + (-18 - (8 - 26t))^2].

Calculate:

x-coordinate difference: b(1 - t)

y-coordinate difference: -18 -8 + 26t = -26 + 26t.

So AC = sqrt[ b²(1 - t)^2 + (26(t - 1))^2 ] = sqrt[ (1 - t)^2 (b² + 676) ) ] = |1 - t| * s.

Since t = 2/13, 1 - t = 11/13, so AC = (11/13)*65 = 55.

So AC = 55, DA = 10, DC = 65. So Triangle(D,A,C) has sides 10, 55, 65. Are any two equal? No. So this violates the isosceles condition. Hence, contradiction again.

Wait, but the problem states that Triangle(D,A,C) is isosceles. So this suggests that our assumption is still incorrect. What's wrong here?

Maybe the isosceles condition is not DA = AC, but another pair. Let me check:

Triangle(D,A,C) has sides DA, AC, DC. We have DA = 10, DC = 65, AC = 55. None are equal. So this doesn't satisfy the isosceles condition. Hence, this approach is missing something.

Let me re-examine the isosceles condition. Maybe it's not DA = AC, but DA = DC or AC = DC.

DA = DC: 10 = 65 → no.

AC = DC: 55 = 65 → no. So no.

Hence, this suggests that even with this setup, there is no solution, indicating a fundamental error in my approach.

Perhaps I need to revisit the entire setup. Let me try a different approach, focusing on the given angles and using trigonometry.

Given that Angle(D,E,A) + Angle(A,E,C) = 90°, and knowing that
