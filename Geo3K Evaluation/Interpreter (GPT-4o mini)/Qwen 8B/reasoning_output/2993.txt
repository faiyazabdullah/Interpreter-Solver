MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a circle with center O, and points A, B, C, D, E, F on the circumference. It says EC and AB are diameters. Also, there are some angle congruences involving angles BO D, D O E, E O F, and F O A. The question is asking for the measure of arc AC.

First, I need to visualize the setup. Since EC and AB are diameters, that means points E and C are endpoints of one diameter, and A and B are endpoints of another diameter. Wait, but diameters pass through the center, so OA, OB, OC, OD, OE, OF are all radii since they're lines from the center O to the circumference. 

Now, the angles mentioned are ∠BO D ≅ ∠DOE ≡ ∠EOF ≡ ∠FOA. Let me note that each of these angles at point O are equal. Since all those angles are at the center of the circle, their measures correspond to the arcs they intercept. Because central angles are equal to the measure of their intercepted arcs. 

So if each of these angles is equal, then the arcs BD, DE, EF, and FA would all be equal. But wait, the problem mentions ∠BO D, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, and ∠FOA. Let me check again. Each of these angles has vertex at O, so each is a central angle. Therefore, each of these angles corresponds to an arc between two points. For example, ∠BO D intercepts arc BD, ∠DOE intercepts arc DE, ∠EOF intercepts arc EF, and ∠FOA intercepts arc FA. So all four angles are equal, which implies that arcs BD, DE, EF, and FA are equal in measure. 

But since the total circumference of a circle is 360 degrees, the sum of all arcs around the circle should add up to 360. However, we also know that EC is a diameter. So the arc from E to C is 180 degrees because it's a straight line through the center. Similarly, AB is a diameter, so arc AB is also 180 degrees. Wait, but how do these arcs relate to the ones mentioned earlier?

Let me think about the entire circle. Starting from point B, moving through D, E, F, and back to A. So the arcs BD, DE, EF, FA are each equal. Let me denote the measure of each of these arcs as x. Then the sum of these four arcs would be 4x. Additionally, we have other arcs in the circle. For instance, arc EA? Or maybe other arcs?

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the entire arrangement. Let me try to map all the points. Points A, B, C, D, E, F are all on the circle. Given that AB and EC are diameters. So AB is a diameter, meaning points A and B are opposite each other. Similarly, E and C are opposite each other. Now, the angles at O are divided into four equal parts: ∠BO D, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, and ∠FOA. So starting from point B, going through D, E, F, and ending at A. So the arcs BD, DE, EF, FA are each equal. Let me assume each of these arcs is x degrees. Then the total of these four arcs is 4x. But what about the rest of the circle?

Since AB is a diameter, the arc AB is 180 degrees. Let me see: Arc AB goes from A to B through the circle. Depending on where the points are placed, but since we have arcs BD, DE, EF, FA, maybe the position of other points needs to be considered. Also, EC is a diameter, so arc EC is 180 degrees. Let me try to find relations between these arcs.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider that starting from point B, moving through D, E, F, then to A. So the arc from B to D is x, D to E is x, E to F is x, F to A is x. So that's four arcs adding up to 4x. Then, what is the remaining part of the circle? From A back to B, passing through the other side? Wait, but AB is a diameter, so arc AB could be either the short way or long way. But since AB is a diameter, the shorter arc AB is 180 degrees. However, depending on how the other points are arranged, maybe the arcs BD, DE, EF, FA are parts of the larger circle.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire circle is divided into these arcs. Let me think. Suppose we start at point B, go through D, E, F, then to A. Then from A, going back to B along the other side. But since AB is a diameter, the arc AB that doesn't pass through D, E, F would be 180 degrees. Wait, but if the arcs BD, DE, EF, FA are each x, then the total of those four arcs is 4x. Then, the arc from A to B via the other side would be 180 degrees. But that arc would consist of the arc from A to F to E to D to B? Not sure. Maybe I need to consider overlapping arcs.

Alternatively, since EC is a diameter, points E and C are opposite each other. So arc EC is 180 degrees. Let me try to connect this with other arcs. Suppose from E to C is 180 degrees. Also, from E to F is x, and from F to A is x. Then, maybe from E to F to A... Hmm, not sure yet.

Wait, maybe I should focus on the arcs BD, DE, EF, FA being equal. Let me suppose each is x degrees. Then, since the entire circle is 360 degrees, the sum of all arcs is 360. But what arcs are present?

Starting from point B, the arcs BD, DE, EF, FA make up part of the circle. Then, there's also the arc from A to B, which is the diameter. Wait, but if the arcs BD, DE, EF, FA are each x, then the total of those four is 4x. Then, the rest of the circle would be the arc from A to B passing through the other side, which is the diameter. But that arc would be 180 degrees. Alternatively, maybe the arc from A to B is split into different parts?

This seems confusing. Perhaps I need to consider all the points on the circle. There are six points: A, B, C, D, E, F. With AB and EC as diameters. Let me try to imagine placing them on the circle.

Since AB is a diameter, points A and B are directly opposite each other. Similarly, points E and C are directly opposite each other. Now, the angles ∠BO D, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, ∠FOA are all congruent. Let me think about how these angles divide the circle. Starting from point B, moving towards D, then E, F, then A. So each of these angles is formed by connecting O to these points. So, the points D, E, F are positioned such that each adjacent pair creates equal central angles.

Therefore, the arcs between B-D, D-E, E-F, F-A are all equal. Let me call each of these arcs x. So, arc BD = arc DE = arc EF = arc FA = x. Then, the total of these four arcs is 4x. What remains of the circle?

Well, the entire circle is 360 degrees. The arcs BD + DE + EF + FA = 4x. Then, the remaining arcs would be from A to B (the other side) and from C to E (since EC is a diameter). Wait, EC is a diameter, so arc EC is 180 degrees. But how does that fit into the existing arcs?

Alternatively, maybe the arcs from A to B and from E to C are separate. Let me try to think differently. Since AB is a diameter, arc AB is 180 degrees. Similarly, arc EC is 180 degrees. Now, considering the arcs BD, DE, EF, FA are each x, then:

From point B to D is x, D to E is x, E to F is x, F to A is x. So the arc from B to A via D, E, F is 4x. But arc BA is also 180 degrees (as it's a diameter), so 4x must equal 180 degrees? Wait, but that would mean each x is 45 degrees. But then, the arc from B to A via D, E, F is 4x = 180°, so x=45°. Then, each of those arcs is 45°, making the total 180°, which matches the diameter AB.

But then, what about the other arcs? For example, from A to E? Or other points?

Also, since EC is a diameter, arc EC is 180 degrees. Let me see if that relates to the other arcs. Suppose from E to C is 180°, and from E to F is x=45°, then from F to C would be arc FC. Wait, but where is point F located? If from E to F is 45°, and then from F to A is another 45°, then from E to A is 45° + 45° = 90°. But EC is a diameter, so from E to C is 180°, so arc EC is 180°. How does that relate to the other points?

Alternatively, maybe the points D, E, F are placed such that from E, moving clockwise, we have F, then A, then B, then D, then ... ?

Wait, perhaps I need to reconstruct the entire circle step by step.

Start with AB as a diameter. Let me place point A at (1,0) and B at (-1,0) assuming unit circle. Then, EC is another diameter. Let me say point E is somewhere on the circle, and point C is its antipodal point. Now, the angles ∠BO D, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, ∠FOA are all equal. So each of these angles is equal, let's say θ. Since there are four angles, the total around point O would be 4θ. But the full circle around O is 360°, so 4θ = 360°, which implies θ = 90°. Wait, but that contradicts something unless the angles are spread out in a certain way.

Wait, no. Wait, the angles mentioned are ∠BO D, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, and ∠FOA. These are four angles at point O, so together they make up part of the circle. Are they adjacent? Like, starting from OB, then OD, then OE, then OF, then OA. So the angles between OB and OD is θ, between OD and OE is θ, between OE and OF is θ, between OF and OA is θ. So total of 4θ. But what about the rest of the circle? The remaining angles would be between OA and OB, which is the arc from A to B, which is a diameter, hence 180°. Wait, but if the four angles θ add up to 4θ, then the total of the angles around point O is 4θ plus the angle between OA and OB, which is 180°, totaling 360°. So 4θ + 180° = 360° → 4θ = 180° → θ = 45°. So each of those angles is 45°, which makes sense.

Therefore, each of those angles (∠BO D, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, ∠FOA) is 45°, so each corresponds to an arc of 45°, since central angles equal their arc measures. So arc BD is 45°, arc DE is 45°, arc EF is 45°, arc FA is 45°. Thus, the total of those four arcs is 4×45° = 180°, which matches the fact that AB is a diameter (arc AB is 180°).

Now, the question asks for the measure of arc AC. So arc AC is from point A to point C. To find this, I need to determine how many of these 45° arcs are in between A and C.

Let me try to trace the positions of the points. Starting from point A, moving through F, then E, then D, then B, then... Wait, but EC is a diameter. Point C is the antipodal of E. So if E is located somewhere, then C is directly opposite.

Let me try to imagine the circle with AB as horizontal diameter, A at (1,0), B at (-1,0). Then, the points D, E, F are placed such that angles from OB to OD is 45°, then OD to OE is 45°, OE to OF is 45°, and OF to OA is 45°. So starting from OB (which points to B at (-1,0)), rotating 45° counterclockwise to OD. Then another 45° to OE, another to OF, then another 45° to OA. Wait, but OA is pointing to A, which is at (1,0). So starting from OB (pointing to B at (-1,0)), moving counterclockwise 45° brings us to OD. Then another 45° to OE, another to OF, and finally another 45° to OA. That would mean that from B to D is 45°, D to E is 45°, E to F is 45°, F to A is 45°, totaling 180°, bringing us from B to A along the upper half-circle.

So, if AB is the horizontal diameter, then point D is 45° counterclockwise from B. Let me assign coordinates for clarity. Assuming the circle has radius r, but since actual length isn't specified, just angles.

Point B is at angle 180°, point A is at 0°. Moving counterclockwise from B (180°), adding 45° gives us point D at 180° - 45° = 135°. Then, point E is another 45° counterclockwise from D, so 135° - 45° = 90°. Then point F is another 45°, so 90° - 45° = 45°. Finally, point A is at 0°, which is another 45° from F (45° - 45° = 0°). That works.

So, points:

- B is at 180°
- D is at 135°
- E is at 90°
- F is at 45°
- A is at 0°

Then, EC is a diameter. Since E is at 90°, then point C is its antipodal point, which is 90° + 180° = 270°, so point C is at 270°.

Now, we need to find the measure of arc AC. Point A is at 0°, and point C is at 270°. The arc from A to C can be measured in two ways: the shorter arc or the longer arc. Since the question refers to arc AC without specifying, it's likely the minor arc, but we need to confirm.

The arc from A (0°) to C (270°) going the short way. Let's compute the difference. Clockwise from A to C: from 0° to 270° is 270°, but counter-clockwise it's 90°. So the smaller arc is 90°. Wait, but that depends on direction.

Wait, in standard terms, the arc AC would typically refer to the minor arc unless stated otherwise. However, let me verify based on the positions.

Point A is at 0°, point C is at 270°. The arc from A to C going counter-clockwise passes through B (180°) and D (135°), etc., but the shortest path would be clockwise from A (0°) down to C (270°), which is 270°, or counter-clockwise from A to C, which would go through the upper semicircle, covering 90°. Wait, no. Wait, if you go counter-clockwise from A (0°) to C (270°), you'd go through 90°, 180°, 270°, so that's three-quarters of the circle, which is 270°. But the minor arc would be the smaller of the two arcs. Since the circle is 360°, the arc AC can be 90° or 270°, but the minor arc is 90°. But wait, let me double-check.

If point A is at 0° and point C is at 270°, then the arc AC that goes from A to C through the lower half-circle (clockwise) is 270°, while the arc going the other way (counter-clockwise) is 90°. Therefore, the measure of arc AC is 90°, which would be answer B. But wait, let me check again.

Wait, point C is at 270°, which is directly downward. Point A is at 0°, directly right. So the arc from A to C going counter-clockwise would pass through 90° (point E), 180° (point B), 270° (point C). Wait, that's three-quarters of the circle, which is 270°, so that's the major arc. The minor arc AC would be the other way, from A (0°) clockwise to C (270°), which is 270°, but that's still more than 180°. Wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe my assignment of positions is incorrect.

Hold on, if point C is at 270°, then the arc from A (0°) to C (270°) can be measured as follows:

Clockwise: from 0° to 270° is 270°, but that's more than a semicircle. Counter-clockwise: from 0° to 270° is 270°, same thing. Wait, no. Wait, the arc between two points can be measured as the minimum of the two possible arcs. But if the points are separated by more than 180°, the minor arc is actually the larger arc? No, the minor arc is always less than or equal to 180°. So if the arc between A and C is 270°, then the minor arc would be 360° - 270° = 90°, which is the smaller one. So the measure of arc AC is 90°, so answer B.

But wait, why is that? Let me think again. If two points are separated by 270°, the minor arc is 90°, because going the other way around the circle covers 90°. So yes, the measure of arc AC is 90°, which is answer B.

But let me cross-validate this with the positions of the other points. Since point E is at 90°, which is the top of the circle. And point C is at 270°, the bottom. So the arc from A (right) to C (bottom) through the left side would be 270°, but the minor arc is the other way, which is from A (right) to C (bottom) through the right side, going clockwise. Wait, but how?

Wait, the arc from A (0°) to C (270°) going clockwise would go from 0° down to 270°, which is 270°, but that's the major arc. The minor arc would be the other way, which is 90°, but how? If you go from A (0°) counter-clockwise to C (270°), that's going through 90°, 180°, 270°, which is 270°, but that's the major arc. Wait, this is confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in assigning the positions.

Wait, point C is the antipodal of E, which is at 90°. Antipodal point of E (90°) is 90° + 180° = 270°, so yes, C is at 270°. Now, arc AC: from A (0°) to C (270°). Let's calculate the absolute difference in degrees. The angle between them is |270° - 0°| = 270°, but since the maximum arc is 360°, the minor arc is min(270°, 360° - 270°) = 90°. Therefore, the measure of arc AC is 90°, which is answer B.

But wait, let me check with another method. Since arc AF is 45°, and arc FE is 45°, arc ED is 45°, arc DB is 45°, arc BC? Wait, point C is at 270°, which is the antipodal of E (at 90°). So from point E (90°) to point C (270°) is 180°, which is a diameter.

So, from point E (90°) to C (270°) is 180°, which is the diameter. Now, looking at the points:

Arc from A (0°) to F (45°): 45°, then from F (45°) to E (90°): another 45°, so arc AE is 90°. Then, from E (90°) to C (270°) is 180°, so arc EC is 180°. Therefore, arc AC is arc AE + arc EC? Wait, no. Arc AC would be from A to C. If we take the path from A to E (90°), which is 90°, then from E to C (another 180°), but that would be 270°, which is the major arc. But the minor arc is the other way, which is 90°, as previously determined.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to get arc AC. Since EC is a diameter, and AB is a diameter. Let me think about other arcs.

For example, arc AC could be composed of arc AF (45°) + arc FE (45°) + arc EC (180°)? No, that would be 45+45+180=270°, which is the major arc. So the minor arc AC is 90°, which is answer B.

Thus, the measure of arc AC is 90°, so the answer is B.
