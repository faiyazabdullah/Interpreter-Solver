MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out what's going on here.

So, we have points G, K, H, J, L, and A. All these points lie on a circle centered at A. That means A is the center of the circle, and all those points are on its circumference. So, AG, AK, AH, AJ, AL are all radii of the circle since they connect the center to points on the circle. 

Now, looking at the angles mentioned. There's Angle(G,L,H) and Angle(K,L,J). Also, there's another angle measure: Angle(K,J,L) which is 97 degrees. The question asks for x, which is the measure of Angle(G,L,H), given that Angle(K,L,J) is 110 degrees and Angle(K,J,L) is 97 degrees.

Wait, let me visualize this. Points G, K, H, J, L are all on the circle with center A. Let me try to sketch mentally. Since all points are on the same circle, maybe some of them form triangles or other figures. 

First, let's consider the angles given. For example, Angle(K,J,L) is 97 degrees. This angle is formed by points K, J, L. Wait, but since all points are on the circle, this could be an inscribed angle or something else. But wait, if three points are on a circle, the angle at point J would be an inscribed angle. However, the vertex of the angle is at J, so the angle is ∠KJL. Similarly, ∠GLH has vertex at L. 

But how do these angles relate? Maybe we can use properties of cyclic quadrilaterals or inscribed angles. Wait, since all points are on the circle, maybe the angles subtend arcs. 

Let me recall that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Also, the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. 

Looking at ∠KJL = 97°. Let me think about triangle KJL. In triangle KJL, the angles are at points K, J, and L. Wait, the angle at J is given as 97°, and perhaps other angles can be found if we know more. But maybe there's a relationship between different angles because of the circle.

Similarly, ∠GLH is another angle. Let me note that points G, H, L are also on the circle, forming angle at L. 

Wait, maybe considering the arcs intercepted by these angles. For instance, ∠KJL intercepts an arc KL. Because in an inscribed angle, the angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts. So, ∠KJL intercepts arc KL. Therefore, the measure of arc KL would be 2*∠KJL = 2*97° = 194°. But wait, the total circumference is 360°, so an arc of 194° seems possible. 

However, if that's the case, then maybe we can find other arcs. Now, looking at ∠K,L,J being 110°, which is given. Wait, ∠K,L,J is the angle at point L, between points K, L, J. So that's ∠KLJ. Wait, but earlier I thought ∠KJL was 97°, so maybe there's confusion here. Let me clarify:

Original problem states:

Angle(K,L,J) measures 110°, and Angle(K,J,L) measures 97°. Wait, the first one is Angle(K,L,J), which is the angle at point L between points K, L, J. So that's ∠K-L-J, which is the angle at L. Then Angle(K,J,L) is the angle at J between points K, J, L, which is ∠K-J-L, which is the same as ∠KJL. 

So, in triangle KJL, we have two angles: at J (∠KJL = 97°) and at L (∠KLJ = 110°). Wait, but in a triangle, the sum of angles should be 180°, so let's check that. 

Sum of angles in triangle KJL would be ∠K + ∠J + ∠L = 180°. Given ∠J is 97°, ∠L is 110°, so adding those gives 97+110=207°, which already exceeds 180°. That can't be possible. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here. 

Wait, that suggests an error in my interpretation. How can the sum of angles in triangle KJL be over 180°? Unless the points are not in the order I think. Maybe the triangle isn't a regular triangle, but since all points are on a circle, maybe the triangle is not a standard triangle? Or perhaps the angles aren't internal angles of the triangle?

Wait, hold on. Maybe the angle ∠K,L,J refers to something else. Let me re-express:

Angle(K,L,J): This is the angle at point L between points K and J. So vertices K-L-J, making the angle at L. Which would be ∠K-L-J, which is indeed an inscribed angle. Similarly, Angle(K,J,L) is the angle at J between K and L, which is ∠K-J-L. 

So in triangle KJL, the angles at J and L are 97° and 110°, respectively. But that sums to 207°, which is impossible. Hence, my assumption that these are internal angles of triangle KJL must be wrong. 

Therefore, there's a mistake in my understanding. Let me reconsider. Perhaps these angles are not part of the same triangle. Wait, the points K, J, L are all on the circle. So, if we consider the triangle KJL, but the angles given are ∠K-L-J (at L) and ∠K-J-L (at J). So those two angles would be parts of triangle KJL, but their sum exceeds 180°, which is impossible. Thus, there's a contradiction here. 

This suggests that either the problem is ill-posed, or my interpretation is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the angles are not inside the triangle but outside? Or perhaps the points are arranged such that the triangle is not convex? Or maybe one of the angles is reflex? Wait, but angles in a triangle can't be reflex (greater than 180°), unless the triangle is considered in a non-Euclidean space, which isn't the case here. 

Alternatively, maybe the points are not all distinct? But the problem states they're points on a circle, so they should be distinct. 

Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The original problem says:

"Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,J)), 110)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(K,J,L)), 97)"

Ah! Wait, Angle(K,L,J) is the angle at point L between K and J. So that's ∠K-L-J. And Angle(K,J,L) is the angle at point J between K and L, so ∠K-J-L. So in triangle KJL, those two angles would be at L and J respectively. Their sum is 110 + 97 = 207°, which is impossible. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. 

Hmm, this suggests that there's an error in the problem setup, but since it's a problem given to solve, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think differently. Maybe these angles are not angles of triangle KJL but angles formed by intersecting lines or something else? 

Wait, maybe the points are not in the order I think. For example, maybe the points K, J, L are arranged such that the angle at L is not part of triangle KJL. Wait, but even then, the angle at L would still be part of the triangle. 

Alternatively, perhaps these are not angles of a triangle but angles formed by secant lines or something else. Wait, but all points are on the circle, so lines connecting them are chords. 

Another possibility: maybe the angles are not inscribed angles but central angles. Wait, but the vertex of the angle is at L, which is on the circle. Central angles have their vertex at the center of the circle, which is point A. So the angles given here are inscribed angles. 

Wait, but inscribed angles depend on the arc they subtend. Let me try again. Suppose that ∠K-L-J is an inscribed angle subtending arc KJ. Wait, no. An inscribed angle subtends the arc opposite to the angle. So ∠K-L-J is at point L, so it subtends arc KJ. Therefore, the measure of ∠K-L-J is half the measure of arc KJ. Similarly, ∠K-J-L (which is the angle at J between K and L) would subtend arc KL. 

Wait, but if that's the case, then:

Measure of ∠K-L-J (angle at L) = ½ arc KJ → arc KJ = 2*110° = 220°
Measure of ∠K-J-L (angle at J) = ½ arc KL → arc KL = 2*97° = 194°

But then, the sum of arcs KJ and KL would be 220 + 194 = 414°, which is greater than 360°, which is impossible since the entire circle is 360°. So this indicates inconsistency. 

This suggests that my current approach is flawed. Let me re-examine the problem. 

Wait, perhaps the angles are not inscribed angles but something else. Alternatively, maybe they are angles formed by intersecting chords. Let me recall that when two chords intersect, the measure of the angle formed is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. 

Wait, but in this case, the angle is at point L, which is on the circle. So, if two chords meet at L, like LK and LJ, then the angle at L would be an inscribed angle. But if the angle is formed by two secants or tangents, then it depends on where they intersect. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves a quadrilateral? Since all points are on the circle, maybe the points form a cyclic quadrilateral. 

Wait, but there are six points: G, K, H, J, L, A. But A is the center. Not sure yet. 

Let me take a different approach. Let me consider the angles given. We have two angles: one at point L (between K and J) measuring 110°, and another at point J (between K and L) measuring 97°. These two angles seem to suggest that the lines involved form a triangle, but their sum exceeding 180° implies that maybe these angles are not within the same triangle. 

Alternatively, perhaps these angles are not both inscribed angles but involve other configurations. Wait, if point L is on the circle, and points K and J are also on the circle, then the angle at L between K and J is indeed an inscribed angle. Similarly for the angle at J. 

But if these two angles are both inscribed angles, then their corresponding arcs would add up to more than 360°, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be an error in my interpretation. 

Wait, perhaps the angles are not directly inscribed angles but something else. Let me think about the position of point A. Since A is the center of the circle, maybe there's a connection between the angles and the center. 

For example, the angle at the center (A) would be twice the inscribed angle subtended by the same arc. But none of the angles given are at the center. 

Wait, but maybe we can relate these angles to arcs involving the center. Let me suppose that. 

Suppose ∠K-L-J (angle at L) is an inscribed angle subtending arc KJ. Then arc KJ = 2*110° = 220°. Similarly, ∠K-J-L (angle at J) is an inscribed angle subtending arc KL. So arc KL = 2*97° = 194°. 

But then, if we add arc KJ (220°) and arc KL (194°), that totals 414°, which is impossible. Hence, contradiction. 

Alternatively, maybe the angles are not subtending those arcs. Let me think again. For angle at L between K and J, the intercepted arc would be the arc KJ that doesn't contain L. Wait, yes! Inscribed angles intercept arcs that are opposite to the angle. So, if the angle is at L, then the intercepted arc is the arc KJ that does not pass through L. 

Similarly, for angle at J between K and L, the intercepted arc is the arc KL that does not pass through J. 

But if that's the case, then the sum of arcs KJ and KL would be the arcs not containing L and J respectively. However, the total circle is 360°, so if arc KJ is 220°, then the rest of the circle is 140°, and arc KL would be 194°, which is larger than the remaining 140°, which is impossible. 

This suggests that there's a fundamental issue with the problem setup, but since it's presented as solvable, I must be missing something. 

Perhaps the angles are not inscribed angles but something else. Let me consider that the points are arranged such that the angles are actually exterior or something. 

Wait, another idea: maybe the points are not all on the same circle? No, the problem states that all points G, K, H, J, L are on Circle(A). So they are all on the same circle. 

Alternatively, maybe the angles given are not inscribed angles but central angles. But central angles have their vertex at the center, which is A. However, the angles given are at points K, L, J, which are on the circumference. 

Wait, unless the angle is formed by two radii. For example, if the angle were at the center, but that's not the case here. 

Let me try to think of the problem differently. The question asks for x, which is the measure of Angle(GLH), i.e., angle at L between G and H. 

Given that all points are on the circle, maybe there's a way to relate this angle to the other angles given. 

Alternatively, since all points are on the circle, maybe there are cyclic quadrilaterals or other relations. 

Wait, if I can find the measure of arc GH, then the angle at L between G and H would be half of the measure of the arc GH that does not contain L. 

But to find that, I might need to relate it to the other arcs. 

But how? 

Earlier, I had issues with the arcs KJ and KL, but maybe there's a way to resolve that. Let me assume that the arcs are measured correctly despite the previous contradiction. 

Suppose arc KJ is 220°, and arc KL is 194°. Even though together they exceed 360°, perhaps they overlap? For instance, if the arcs are overlapping or if the points are arranged in a certain way. 

Wait, if arc KJ is 220°, then the arc from K to J passing through the opposite side of the circle is 220°, and arc KL is 194°, which might overlap with arc KJ. 

But without knowing the exact arrangement of points, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, maybe the angles given are not inscribed angles but angles formed by intersecting chords. For example, if two chords intersect at a point on the circle, the angle formed is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. 

Wait, but for intersecting chords inside the circle, the formula is different. However, if the intersection is on the circle, then it's an inscribed angle. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves the concept of the external angle. For example, if an angle is formed outside the circle, but in this case, the vertex is on the circle. 

I'm stuck here. Let me try to look for another approach. 

Since all points are on the circle, maybe the angles given relate to arcs that can be connected. Let me focus on the angle at L: ∠K-L-J = 110°, and at J: ∠K-J-L = 97°. 

Assume that these angles are inscribed angles. So, the arc subtended by ∠K-L-J (at L) is arc KJ, and the arc subtended by ∠K-J-L (at J) is arc KL. 

Thus, arc KJ = 2 * 110° = 220°, and arc KL = 2 * 97° = 194°. 

Now, the sum of arcs KJ and KL would be 220 + 194 = 414°, which is more than the full circle. But since arcs can overlap, perhaps the arcs are not disjoint. 

For instance, if the arc KJ is 220°, and arc KL is 194°, then the overlapping portion could account for the excess. 

But how does this help us find arc GH? 

Well, if I can find the measure of arc GH, then angle GLH would be half of the arc GH not containing L. 

But how to find arc GH? 

Maybe there's a relation between the arcs. Let me consider that the total circle is 360°, so the sum of all arcs around the circle is 360°. 

But with the arcs KJ and KL being 220° and 194°, respectively, there's overlap. Let me imagine points K, J, L on the circle. 

If arc KJ is 220°, then moving from K to J along the longer arc is 220°, implying that the shorter arc KJ is 140° (since 360 - 220 = 140). Similarly, arc KL is 194°, so the shorter arc KL is 166° (360 - 194 = 166). 

But how does this help? 

Alternatively, maybe the arcs KJ and KL share a common endpoint. For example, if we have points K, L, J on the circle, then arc KJ and arc KL would share point K. 

But without knowing the exact positions, it's challenging. 

Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that the sum of arcs around the circle is 360°. Let me attempt to express the arcs in terms of variables. 

Let me denote the arcs as follows:

Arc KJ = 220° (from earlier)
Arc KL = 194° (from earlier)
But since the circle is 360°, the remaining arcs would be... Well, if I consider arc JL, which would be part of the circle. 

But this seems too vague. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that ∠K-L-J is an inscribed angle subtending arc KJ. What if it subtends a different arc? 

Wait, for an inscribed angle at point L, between points K and J, the intercepted arc is the arc that is opposite to the angle, i.e., arc KJ that does not contain L. So if the angle is at L, then the arc KJ not containing L. 

Similarly, for ∠K-J-L at point J, the intercepted arc is KL not containing J. 

So, arc KJ (not containing L) = 220°, and arc KL (not containing J) = 194°. 

Now, the sum of these two arcs would be 220 + 194 = 414°, which is more than 360°, indicating that the arcs overlap. 

Imagine that the arc KJ (not containing L) is 220°, which means that the arc from K to J passing through the side opposite to L is 220°, and the arc KL (not containing J) is 194°, which means the arc from K to L passing through the side opposite to J is 194°. 

This suggests that points K, L, J are arranged such that the arcs between them overlap. 

To find the measure of arc GH, which is needed for angle GLH, I need to find the arc GH not containing L. 

But how can I relate this to the existing arcs? 

Maybe there's a relationship between the arcs through the circle. Let me think about the entire circle. 

If arc KJ is 220°, then the arc from J back to K via the other side is 360 - 220 = 140°. Similarly, arc KL is 194°, so the arc from L to K via the other side is 360 - 194 = 166°. 

But how does this help with finding arc GH? 

Perhaps I need to find the position of points G and H. But the problem mentions points G, H, J, L, K, and A. It doesn't specify the positions of G and H relative to the others. 

Wait, the angle in question is ∠GLH, which is at point L between G and H. So, points G and H are also on the circle. 

So, if I can find the arc GH, then the measure of ∠GLH would be half of the arc GH not containing L. 

But to find arc GH, I need to relate it to the other arcs. 

But without knowing where G and H are located relative to K, J, and L, this seems difficult. 

Wait, perhaps there's another angle given? No, the only other information is that all points are on the circle. 

Wait, maybe there's a symmetry or something. Let me consider that all points are on the circle, so the configuration is symmetric. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves supplementary angles or something else. 

Wait, maybe I should look for other relationships. For example, if there are other angles or arcs that can be determined. 

But since the problem gives only two angles (the ones at L and J), and asks for x (the angle at L between G and H), I need to find a way to relate these. 

Wait, perhaps the points G and H are positioned such that arc GH relates to the other arcs. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a cyclic quadrilateral involving points G, H, L, and another point. 

But without more info, it's challenging. 

Wait, maybe the key lies in the fact that all points are on the circle, so the sum of certain arcs equals 360°. 

Let me try to define variables for the arcs. Let me denote:

Let’s call arc KJ = a, arc KL = b, arc JL = c, arc GK = d, arc HL = e, arc HG = f, etc. But this might get too complicated. 

Alternatively, focusing on the arcs related to the given angles. 

We have arc KJ (not containing L) = 220°, and arc KL (not containing J) = 194°. 

Let me imagine the circle with points K, J, L. Arc KJ not containing L is 220°, so the arc from K to J passing through the side opposite to L is 220°. This implies that the arc from J to K passing through L is 140° (since 360 - 220 = 140). 

Similarly, arc KL not containing J is 194°, so the arc from K to L passing through the side opposite to J is 194°, implying that the arc from L to K passing through J is 166° (360 - 194 = 166). 

Now, let's see what this tells us about the positions of K, L, J. 

From the above, the arc from J to K through L is 140°, and the arc from L to K through J is 166°. Wait, this seems contradictory. Let me explain. 

If arc KJ not containing L is 220°, then the arc from K to J passing through the side opposite to L is 220°, so the arc from J to K passing through L is 360 - 220 = 140°. 

Similarly, arc KL not containing J is 194°, so the arc from K to L passing through the side opposite to J is 194°, hence the arc from L to K passing through J is 360 - 194 = 166°. 

So, the arc from J to K through L is 140°, and the arc from L to K through J is 166°. 

Wait, but this would mean that the arc from J to K through L is 140°, and the arc from L to K through J is 166°, which implies that the arc from J to K through L plus the arc from L to K through J equals the total circle. Wait, no. The arc from J to K through L is 140°, and the arc from L to K through J is 166°. But these two arcs are part of the same circle. Wait, this suggests that the arc from J to K through L is 140°, and the arc from L to K through J is 166°, which would imply that the arc from J to L through K is 166°, and the arc from L to K through J is 140°, which seems inconsistent. 

This indicates that there's a miscalculation. Let me double-check. 

If arc KJ not containing L is 220°, then the arc from K to J through the side not containing L is 220°, so the arc from J to K through L is 360 - 220 = 140°. 

Similarly, arc KL not containing J is 194°, so the arc from K to L through the side not containing J is 194°, so the arc from L to K through J is 360 - 194 = 166°. 

So, the arc from J to K through L is 140°, and the arc from L to K through J is 166°. 

Now, if we combine these, the arc from J to K through L (140°) and the arc from L to K through J (166°) must be consistent. Wait, but these are two different paths from J to K: one goes through L (140°), the other goes through J to L to K through J? No, that doesn't make sense. 

Actually, the arc from J to K through L is 140°, and the arc from L to K through J is 166°, which suggests that the arc from J to L through K is 166°, and the arc from J to K through L is 140°. 

This implies that the arc from J to L through K is 166°, and the arc from J to K through L is 140°. Adding these two arcs, we get the arc from J to L through K (166°) plus arc from J to K through L (140°) equals the whole circle? No, because those are two separate paths. 

This seems too tangled. Perhaps I need to abandon this approach and think differently. 

Let me recall that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°, but earlier calculation showed that with the given angles, it's impossible. This suggests that the angles are not part of the same triangle, or that they are not internal angles. 

Wait, maybe the angles are not both in the same triangle. For example, ∠K-L-J (110°) and ∠K-J-L (97°) are angles at different points, so they don't belong to the same triangle. 

In that case, perhaps there's a way to use the fact that the sum of all arcs around the circle is 360°. 

Let me try to calculate the arcs between various points. 

We have:

arc KJ (not containing L) = 220°, so the arc from K to J through the side not containing L is 220°, meaning the arc from J to K through L is 140°.

Similarly, arc KL (not containing J) = 194°, so the arc from K to L through the side not containing J is 194°, meaning the arc from L to K through J is 166°.

Now, let's consider the arc from J to L through K. This arc would be the sum of arc JK through L (140°) and arc KL through J (166°)? No, that doesn't make sense. 

Wait, if the arc from J to K through L is 140°, then the arc from J to L through K would be part of that. Let me think. 

If I go from J to K through L, that's 140°, so the arc from J to L through K would be part of that. Let me denote the arc JL as some value. 

Alternatively, maybe I can find the measure of arc JL. 

Since arc KJ not containing L is 220°, and arc KL not containing J is 194°, perhaps we can find the arc JL. 

Let me try to imagine the circle with points K, J, L. The arc from K to J not containing L is 220°, and the arc from K to L not containing J is 194°. 

Let me consider the arc from J to L. To find this, I can subtract the known arcs from the total. 

But without knowing the exact positions, it's tricky. 

Let me assume that the arc from J to L is x. Then, the arc from K to J not containing L is 220°, which includes the arc from K to J passing through the side not containing L. This arc would consist of the arc from K to L through J plus the arc from L to J? No, I need to think carefully. 

Alternatively, let's consider that the total circle is 360°. 

The arc from K to J not containing L is 220°, and the arc from K to L not containing J is 194°. 

Let me denote the arc from J to L as y. Then, the arc from K to J not containing L is composed of the arc from K to L through J plus the arc from L to J? No, I'm getting confused. 

Maybe I should use the fact that the sum of arcs around the circle is 360°. 

Let me denote:

- Arc KJ (not containing L) = 220°
- Arc KL (not containing J) = 194°

These two arcs overlap in some way. Let me try to express the total circle as the sum of these arcs minus their overlap. 

But without knowing the overlap, this is difficult. 

Alternatively, let me assume that the arc from J to L is z. Then, the arc from K to J not containing L is 220°, which would be equal to arc K to L through J plus arc J to L. Wait, no. 

This is getting too abstract. Maybe I need to switch tactics. 

Since the problem is asking for x, which is the measure of ∠GLH, and all points are on the circle, perhaps there's a relationship between this angle and the given angles. 

Let me consider that ∠GLH is an inscribed angle. If I can find the arc it subtends, then x would be half of that arc. 

But how to find that arc? 

If I can find the arc GH, then x = ½(arc GH not containing L). 

But to find arc GH, I need to relate it to the other arcs. 

Perhaps there's a way to use the fact that all points are on the circle and that certain arcs are known. 

Wait, if I consider that the arc KJ is 220°, and arc KL is 194°, maybe the arc from G to H can be derived from these. 

But without knowing where G and H are, this is impossible. 

Wait, the problem mentions points G, H, J, L, K, and A. It doesn't specify the positions of G and H, but they are on the circle. Maybe there's a pattern or symmetry. 

Wait, the problem might be designed such that the angle x is related to the other angles through some property. For example, if the points are arranged such that the arcs add up in a certain way. 

Let me try to think about the sum of all arcs. 

Total circle is 360°. 

If I can find the arcs related to the given angles, perhaps I can find the arc for GH. 

But I'm stuck. 

Maybe I should consider that the sum of the given angles' arcs is 220 + 194 = 414°, which is 360 + 54°. This suggests that there's an overlap of 54° between the arcs. 

If the overlapping arc is 54°, then maybe the arc GH is related to this. 

But this is too speculative. 

Alternatively, since the problem gives four answer choices, maybe I can test each option. 

Let me assume x is 97 (option A). If x = 97°, then the arc subtended by ∠GLH would be 194°, which is the same as arc KL. But why? 

Or if x is 110°, then the arc would be 220°, same as arc KJ. 

Alternatively, if x is 99°, then arc GH would be 198°, and if x is 123°, then arc GH is 246°. 

But how to choose between these? 

Wait, perhaps there's a relationship between the angles given and the desired angle. Let me think about the triangle formed by points G, L, H. 

If I can find the measure of arc GH, then x is half of that arc. 

But to find arc GH, I need to relate it to the other arcs. 

Let me assume that the arc KJ is 220°, arc KL is 194°, and arc JL is some value. 

If I can find arc JL, then maybe I can find other arcs. 

But how? 

Let me try to calculate arc JL. 

If arc KJ is 220°, and arc KL is 194°, then the arc from J to L would be part of the circle. 

Assuming that the points are arranged in the order K, J, L, ... around the circle. 

But without knowing the exact order, it's hard. 

Alternatively, if I consider that the arc from K to J is 220°, and the arc from K to L is 194°, then the arc from J to L would be 194° - 220°, but this doesn't make sense. 

Wait, if the arc from K to J is 220°, and the arc from K to L is 194°, then the arc from J to L would be |220° - 194°| = 26°, but this is just a guess. 

If arc JL is 26°, then the arc from J to L is 26°, and the arc from L to J is 360 - 26 = 334°. 

But this is arbitrary. 

If I proceed under this assumption, then the arc GH would be something, but I don't see how. 

This approach is not working. 

Maybe I should consider that the sum of the given angles' arcs is 414°, which is 360° + 54°, suggesting that the overlapping arc is 54°. 

If the overlapping arc is 54°, then perhaps the arc GH is related to this. 

But I'm not seeing the connection. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. 

Wait, the problem might involve the fact that the sum of the angles around point L is 360°. 

At point L, there are several angles. One of them is ∠K-L-J = 110°, and another is ∠GLH = x. Are there other angles at point L? 

Yes, since there are points G and H on the circle, there would be angles at L between other points. 

But without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to say. 

Wait, if I assume that the points are arranged in the order G, K, L, J, H around the circle, then I can compute the arcs. 

But this is pure speculation. 

Let me try. Assume the points are arranged as G, K, L, J, H around the circle. 

Then, arc GK, arc KL, arc LJ, arc JH, arc HG. 

But without knowing the exact positions, this is arbitrary. 

Alternatively, if I consider that the angle at L between K and J is 110°, and the angle at L between G and H is x, perhaps these two angles are supplementary or something. 

But without knowing the other angles at L, this is guesswork. 

Given that I'm running out of ideas, perhaps I should consider that the answer is 97° (option A), matching one of the given angles, but this is a shot in the dark. 

Alternatively, since the given angles are 110° and 97°, and the options include 97, 99, 110, 123, perhaps x is 97° or 123°. 

Wait, if the angle at L is 110°, and there's another angle at L, perhaps they are supplementary? Like, if the angle at L between K and J is 110°, and the angle at L between G and H is x, and they form a straight line, then x would be 70°, but that's not among the options. 

Alternatively, if the angles at L are part of a triangle, but earlier calculation shows that it's impossible. 

I'm really stuck. Given the time I've spent and lack of progress, perhaps I should consider that the answer is 97°, but I'm not confident. 

Wait, another idea: the angle at L between K and J is 110°, which is an inscribed angle, so its arc is 220°. The angle at J between K and L is 97°, which is an inscribed angle, so its arc is 194°. Now, the sum of these two arcs is 220 + 194 = 414°, which is 360° + 54°. This suggests that the overlapping arc is 54°. 

If the overlapping arc is 54°, then the arc from K to L is 194°, and the arc from K to J is 220°, so the overlapping arc would be the part that is counted in both. 

This might mean that the arc from K to L is 194°, and the arc from K to J is 220°, so the arc from L to J is 220 - 194 = 26°. 

If that's the case, then the arc from L to J is 26°, which would mean that the arc from J to L is 26°. 

Now, if I want to find the arc for ∠GLH, which is at L between G and H, then the arc GH would be related to other arcs. 

But without knowing where G and H are, this is still unclear. 

But if I assume that the arc GH is the same as the arc JL, which is 26°, then the angle at L would be 13°, which is not an option. 

Alternatively, if the arc GH is 194°, then the angle would be 97°, which is option A. 

But why would arc GH be 194°? 

Maybe because it's the same as arc KL, which is 194°. 

But why would arc GH be equal to arc KL? 

Unless points G and H are placed such that arc GH corresponds to arc KL. 

But this is speculative. 

If I assume that, then x would be 97°, which is option A. 

But this is a stretch. 

Alternatively, if the arc GH is 220°, then x would be 110°, option C. 

But why? 

Without further information, it's impossible to know. 

Given that the answer choices include 97° (option A) and 110° (option C), and the given angles are 110° and 97°, it's possible that x is one of these. 

But how to decide? 

Wait, the problem might involve the fact that the angles at L and J are part of a cyclic quadrilateral. 

For example, if points G, H, J, L form a cyclic quadrilateral, then opposite angles would sum to 180°. But without knowing the other angles, this is unclear. 

Alternatively, if ∠GLH is part of a triangle with other angles. 

At this point, I think I need to make an educated guess. Given that one of the angles given is 110°, and the other is 97°, and the options include 97°, which is one of the given angles, it's possible that x is 97°. 

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, if the angle at L is 110°, and the angle at J is 97°, and there's some relationship between them, like supplementary or complementary, but I don't see it. 

Alternatively, the sum of the angles at L and J is 110 + 97 = 207°, and if there's some relation to the angle x, but I don't see it. 

Given the uncertainty, and the presence of 97° as an option, I'll go with option A.
