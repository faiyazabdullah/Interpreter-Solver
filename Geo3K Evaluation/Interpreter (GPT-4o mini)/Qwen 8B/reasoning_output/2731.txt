Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the given information and figure out how to find the perimeter of the parallelogram.

So, the problem says we have a parallelogram ABCD. Let me recall that in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in length and parallel. Also, the diagonals bisect each other, but I'm not sure if that's directly useful here. 

Now, the given predicates are:
- Parallelogram(A,B,C,D): So ABCD is a parallelogram.
- Length of diagonal AC is 12 units.
- Length of diagonal BD is 13 units.
- Height of the parallelogram is 5 units.
- There's a right angle at angle ADC (since it mentions Angle(A,D,C) is a right angle).

Wait, angle ADC being a right angle? That means one of the angles in the parallelogram is 90 degrees. But in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. If one angle is 90 degrees, then all angles must be 90 degrees because consecutive angles would add up to 180. Wait, that would make it a rectangle. But rectangles have diagonals equal in length. However, here the diagonals are different: AC=12 and BD=13. That contradicts the property of a rectangle where diagonals are equal. Hmm, so maybe my initial thought is wrong?

Wait, hold on. If angle ADC is a right angle, then the parallelogram has a right angle, making it a rectangle? No, wait. In a general parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. If one angle is 90 degrees, then the adjacent angle is also 90 degrees, making all angles 90 degrees. Therefore, the shape would be a rectangle. But in that case, the diagonals should be equal. However, here the diagonals are given as 12 and 13, which are unequal. This seems contradictory. What's going on here?

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Maybe the angle mentioned isn't at vertex D? Let me check again. The predicate says "RightAngle(Angle(A,D,C))", which translates to angle ADC being a right angle. So point A connected to D connected to C. So angle at D between points A, D, C. So yes, angle ADC is a right angle. Therefore, the parallelogram has a right angle at D. Which would mean that the sides AD and DC are perpendicular. Since it's a parallelogram, AD is congruent to BC, and DC is congruent to AB. Also, since angle ADC is 90 degrees, then sides AD and DC are perpendicular. Therefore, the parallelogram is actually a rectangle? Because if one angle is 90 degrees, then all angles are 90 degrees. But in that case, diagonals should be equal. However, here they're different. Therefore, there's something wrong here. How can a parallelogram with a right angle have unequal diagonals?

Wait, maybe the figure isn't a rectangle. Wait, but if it's a parallelogram with a right angle, then it must be a rectangle. Unless... unless it's not a parallelogram? But the first premise says it's a parallelogram. So there's inconsistency here. Or maybe my understanding is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the diagonals aren't AC and BD. Wait, in a parallelogram, the diagonals connect opposite vertices. So AC connects A to C, BD connects B to D. So in a rectangle, diagonals are equal. Here, they are 12 and 13. That suggests that the figure is not a rectangle. But how can a parallelogram have a right angle and unequal diagonals? That seems impossible. Therefore, there must be some mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, maybe the parallelogram isn't a rectangle, but still has a right angle. Wait, but in a parallelogram, if one angle is 90 degrees, then all angles are 90 degrees. Hence, it's a rectangle. Therefore, the given diagonals should be equal. But here they are not. Therefore, there's a contradiction. Therefore, maybe the problem isn't about a standard parallelogram? Or maybe I misread the problem?

Let me re-examine the problem statement. It says "Parallelogram(A,B,C,D)" which implies that ABCD is a parallelogram. Then, the diagonals AC and BD have lengths 12 and 13 respectively. And height is 5. Also, there's a right angle at angle ADC. So according to the premises, this is possible? How?

Wait, maybe the figure is not convex? Or perhaps it's a degenerate parallelogram? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the right angle is not between two adjacent sides? Wait, angle ADC is formed by points A-D-C, so that's angle at D between sides DA and DC. In a parallelogram, DA and DC are adjacent sides. Therefore, if that angle is 90 degrees, then DA is perpendicular to DC. So that would imply that the parallelogram is a rectangle. But then diagonals should be equal. But here they are different. So how is this possible?

This suggests that there's an error in the problem setup, but since the problem is given, I must proceed. Perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Let me think differently. Maybe the diagonals are not AC and BD? Wait, no. In a parallelogram ABCD, the diagonals are AC and BD. For example, in order, the vertices are A, B, C, D. So connecting A to C and B to D. 

Wait, but if ABCD is a parallelogram, then vectors AB and DC are equal, and vectors AD and BC are equal. Now, if angle ADC is 90 degrees, then vectors DC and DA are perpendicular. So DC · DA = 0. But since DC = AB and DA = BC, this would imply that AB and DA are perpendicular. Therefore, the sides AB and DA are perpendicular, making the figure a rectangle. But then diagonals should be equal. Hence, contradiction.

But since the problem states that diagonals are 12 and 13, which are different, there's a conflict. Therefore, perhaps the figure is not a parallelogram? But the first premise says it is. So, this seems like a paradox. How can a parallelogram have a right angle and unequal diagonals?

Wait, unless the figure is not a parallelogram but another type of quadrilateral. But the problem explicitly states it's a parallelogram. Therefore, there must be an alternative interpretation. Maybe the right angle is not between the sides but something else? No, angle ADC is formed by points A, D, C, so it's the angle at D between A and C. So that's between side DA and DC.

Hmm. Let me try to visualize. Suppose we have a parallelogram ABCD, with angle ADC being 90 degrees. Let me draw this mentally. Points A, B, C, D arranged such that AB is parallel to CD, and AD is parallel to BC. At point D, angle ADC is 90 degrees. Therefore, AD is perpendicular to DC. Thus, sides AD and DC are perpendicular. Therefore, the figure has a right angle at D. So, this would make the figure a rectangle? But then diagonals are equal. However, here they are given as 12 and 13. Therefore, this seems impossible. Therefore, there must be an error in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the figure is not a rectangle, but a different kind of parallelogram. Wait, but if one angle is 90 degrees, then it's a rectangle. So, this is confusing. Unless the figure is not convex? Or maybe it's a three-dimensional figure? But the problem mentions a parallelogram, which is typically planar.

Alternatively, maybe the diagonals are not the ones I think. Wait, in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. So, if AC and BD are diagonals, their intersection point is the midpoint. But in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal. So if AC is 12 and BD is 13, then it's not a rectangle. Therefore, the presence of a right angle at D implies that it's a rectangle, but the diagonals are unequal. Contradiction. Therefore, there's a contradiction in the premises. But since the problem is given, I have to work around it. Maybe there's a miscalculation?

Wait, perhaps the right angle is not part of the parallelogram? No, the problem says "RightAngle(Angle(A,D,C))" which is part of the parallelogram. So, I'm stuck here. How can a parallelogram have a right angle and unequal diagonals?

Wait, perhaps the figure is not a parallelogram but a different quadrilateral? No, the first predicate says it's a parallelogram. Therefore, this seems like a trick question. But I need to find a way to resolve this. Let me think again.

Maybe the diagonals are not AC and BD. Wait, in a parallelogram, the diagonals are AC and BD. But if angle ADC is 90 degrees, then maybe the diagonals are not AC and BD? Wait, no. The diagonals are always the connections between opposite vertices. So in ABCD, diagonals are AC and BD. 

Alternatively, perhaps the height is not referring to the height relative to the base? Wait, the height of the parallelogram is given as 5. The height of a parallelogram is the distance between two opposite sides. So if angle ADC is 90 degrees, then the height could be one of the sides. For instance, if AD is perpendicular to DC, then the height corresponding to base DC would be AD. But if AD is perpendicular to DC, then the height is AD. But also, the area of the parallelogram would be base times height. 

Wait, let's consider this. Suppose ABCD is a parallelogram with angle ADC = 90 degrees. Then, AD is perpendicular to DC. Therefore, the sides AD and DC are perpendicular. So, the parallelogram is a rectangle? No, because in a rectangle, all angles are 90 degrees. But if only one angle is 90 degrees, then others are not necessarily. Wait, no. In a parallelogram, if one angle is 90 degrees, then all angles are 90 degrees. Therefore, it's a rectangle. Therefore, the diagonals should be equal. But the problem states that the diagonals are 12 and 13. So this is conflicting.

Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding. Let me try to think outside the box. Maybe the right angle is not between the sides but something else. Wait, angle ADC is the angle between AD and DC. So, if AD and DC are perpendicular, then it's a rectangle. But the diagonals are not equal. Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, the only possibility is that the problem contains an error. But since this is a problem given to solve, there must be a way. 

Wait, perhaps the figure is not a parallelogram but a different quadrilateral? No, the first predicate says it's a parallelogram. Maybe the diagonals are not AC and BD? Wait, no. Diagonals are defined as connecting opposite vertices. So AC and BD. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is in three dimensions? Like a skew parallelogram? But in 3D space, a parallelogram is still a planar figure. 

Alternatively, maybe the given diagonals are not the actual diagonals but something else. Wait, the problem says "LengthOf(Line(A,C))" is 12 and "LengthOf(Line(B,D))" is 13. So those are the lengths of the diagonals. So, in a parallelogram, the sum of squares of the diagonals equals twice the sum of squares of the sides. Wait, the formula is: In a parallelogram, the sum of the squares of the diagonals equals twice the sum of the squares of the sides. So:

AC² + BD² = 2(AB² + AD²)

Given that AC = 12 and BD = 13, then:

12² + 13² = 2(AB² + AD²)

Calculating left side: 144 + 169 = 313. So 313 = 2(AB² + AD²). Therefore, AB² + AD² = 313 / 2 = 156.5.

Also, since it's a parallelogram, AB = CD and AD = BC. Also, the height is 5. The height h of a parallelogram is given by h = AD * sin(theta), where theta is the angle between sides AD and AB. Wait, but if angle ADC is 90 degrees, then theta is 90 degrees. Wait, angle ADC is the angle between AD and DC. In a parallelogram, DC is equal to AB. So angle ADC is the angle between AD and DC, which is same as angle between AD and AB. Wait, no. Let me clarify.

In a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. So, if angle ADC is 90 degrees, then the adjacent angle at D, which would be angle ADC and angle DAB, are supplementary. Wait, no. Let me label the parallelogram properly.

Points A, B, C, D in order. So sides AB, BC, CD, DA. Angles at A, B, C, D. So angle ADC is at point D, between sides DC and DA. So that's angle between DC and DA. In a parallelogram, DC is congruent to AB, and DA is congruent to BC. 

Since angle ADC is 90 degrees, then the sides DA and DC are perpendicular. So, DA ⊥ DC. Therefore, the parallelogram has a right angle at D, implying that DA and DC are perpendicular. Therefore, the parallelogram is a rectangle? Wait, but in a rectangle, all angles are 90 degrees. But if DA and DC are perpendicular, then the adjacent angle at D is 90 degrees, so the angle at C would be supplementary to angle D, which would be 90 degrees, so angle at C is 90 degrees as well. Similarly, angles at A and B would also be 90 degrees. Therefore, it's a rectangle. Hence, diagonals should be equal. But in this case, diagonals are 12 and 13, which are unequal. This is a contradiction. 

But since the problem gives these diagonals, I have to assume that the figure is not a rectangle. Therefore, there must be a mistake in assuming that angle ADC being 90 degrees implies all angles are 90 degrees. Maybe the figure is not a parallelogram? But the problem says it is. 

Wait, maybe the right angle is not between the sides but involves the diagonal? No, the right angle is at point D, between points A-D-C. So, it's between the sides DA and DC. 

Wait, maybe the parallelogram is not convex? But even so, having a right angle at D would still require the other angles to be 90 degrees. 

I'm really confused. Let's try to approach this mathematically. Let me denote the sides of the parallelogram. Let AB = CD = x, and AD = BC = y. The diagonals are AC = 12 and BD = 13. From the formula for parallelograms, we have:

AC² + BD² = 2(x² + y²)

Plugging in the values:

12² + 13² = 2(x² + y²)

Which is 144 + 169 = 313 = 2(x² + y²) → x² + y² = 313 / 2 = 156.5

Also, the height of the parallelogram is 5. The height h can be expressed as h = y * sin(theta), where theta is the angle between sides y and x. Wait, but since there's a right angle at D, which is between sides y (AD) and x (DC)? Wait, if angle ADC is 90 degrees, then theta is 90 degrees. Therefore, sin(theta) is 1. Hence, h = y * 1 = y. Therefore, y = 5. 

Ah! This is crucial. If angle ADC is 90 degrees, then the height corresponding to base DC is AD, which is y. Therefore, y = 5. 

So, substituting back into the equation x² + y² = 156.5, we get x² + 5² = 156.5 → x² + 25 = 156.5 → x² = 131.5 → x = sqrt(131.5). 

Then, the perimeter of the parallelogram is 2x + 2y = 2*sqrt(131.5) + 2*5. 

But wait, let me calculate this. First, compute sqrt(131.5). Let me see:

sqrt(131.5) ≈ sqrt(121) = 11, sqrt(144)=12, so sqrt(131.5) is approximately 11.47. Let me calculate more precisely:

11^2 = 121, 11.5^2 = 132.25. So 131.5 is 132.25 - 0.75, so sqrt(131.5) ≈ 11.5 - (0.75)/(2*11.5) ≈ 11.5 - 0.75/23 ≈ 11.5 - 0.0326 ≈ 11.4674. So approx 11.47. 

Thus, 2x ≈ 2*11.47 ≈ 22.94, and 2y = 10. Total perimeter ≈ 22.94 + 10 = 32.94. Wait, but none of the answer choices are close to this. The options are A. 25, B. 50, C. 60, D. 100. So this suggests that my calculation is wrong. 

Wait, but why did I assume that h = y? Let me verify this. The height of a parallelogram is the distance between two opposite sides. If angle ADC is 90 degrees, then the height corresponding to base DC is indeed AD, since AD is perpendicular to DC. Hence, h = AD = y. Therefore, y = 5. 

So then, with y = 5, x² = 156.5 - 25 = 131.5. So x = sqrt(131.5). Then, perimeter is 2*(x + y) = 2*(sqrt(131.5) + 5). Let me calculate this numerically. 

First, sqrt(131.5) ≈ 11.47 (as above). Adding 5 gives 16.47. Multiply by 2 gives 32.94. But this is not among the answer choices. The closest is A. 25, but that's still off. 

Hmm, this suggests that either there's a mistake in my reasoning, or perhaps I've misunderstood the relationship between the height and the sides. Let me double-check. 

The height h of a parallelogram is the distance between two opposite sides. For example, if we take base DC, then the height is the distance from DC to AB, which would be the length of AD multiplied by sin(theta), where theta is the angle between AD and DC. But in this case, since angle ADC is 90 degrees, the angle between AD and DC is 90 degrees, so sin(theta) = 1. Hence, h = AD * 1 = AD. Therefore, AD = 5. So y = 5. 

Therefore, that part is correct. So with y = 5, x² = 156.5 - 25 = 131.5. So x = sqrt(131.5). 

But then, the perimeter would be 2*(x + y) = 2*(sqrt(131.5) + 5). Let me calculate this more accurately. 

Calculate sqrt(131.5):

We know that 11.47^2 = ?

Let me compute 11.47^2: 11^2 = 121, 0.47^2 = 0.2209, and cross term 2*11*0.47 = 10.34. Total: 121 + 10.34 + 0.2209 ≈ 131.5609. Close to 131.5. So sqrt(131.5) ≈ 11.47 - a tiny bit less. Let's say approximately 11.47. 

So total perimeter ≈ 2*(11.47 + 5) = 2*16.47 = 32.94. Still not matching any options. 

But the answer choices don't have this. So where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the height is not AD? Let me reconsider. In a parallelogram, the height can be related to the area. Area = base × height. Also, the area can be calculated as |AB × AD| = ab sin(theta), where a and b are the lengths of the sides and theta is the angle between them. 

In our case, since angle ADC is 90 degrees, theta is 90 degrees, so sin(theta) = 1. Therefore, area = AB * AD = x*y. Also, area = base * height. If we take base as DC (which is x), then height is AD = y. So area = x * y. Alternatively, taking base as AD (y), the height would be x * sin(theta), where theta is the angle between AD and AB. Wait, but since angle ADC is 90 degrees, the angle between AD and DC is 90 degrees, which is the same as the angle between AD and AB? No. Wait, in a parallelogram, the angle between AD and DC is the same as the angle between AB and AD. Wait, no. Let me clarify. 

In parallelogram ABCD, angle at D is between AD and DC. In a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. So, angle at D is supplementary to angle at A. If angle at D is 90 degrees, then angle at A is 90 degrees as well. Wait, no. In a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So angle D + angle C = 180 degrees. But if angle D is 90 degrees, then angle C is 90 degrees. Wait, but angle C is at point C, which is between B, C, D. So angle at C is between BC and CD. Since BC is congruent to AD, and CD is congruent to AB. So if angle at D is 90 degrees, then angle at C is 90 degrees. Hence, all angles are 90 degrees. Therefore, it's a rectangle. 

But in that case, diagonals are equal. Hence, AC = BD. But the problem states they are 12 and 13. So this is a contradiction. 

But since the problem gives these diagonals, there must be another way. Maybe the height is not AD? Let me think again. If the height is 5, then area = base * height. Let's say the base is DC (which is x), then height is h = 5. So area = x * 5. Alternatively, if the base is AD (which is y), then height is h' = x * sin(theta), where theta is the angle between AD and AB. But since angle ADC is 90 degrees, and in a parallelogram, angle between AD and DC is 90 degrees, which is the same as angle between AD and AB? No. Wait, angle between AD and DC is 90 degrees, and DC is congruent to AB. So the angle between AD and DC is the same as the angle between AD and AB? No, because AB is parallel to DC. So the angle between AD and AB is the same as the angle between AD and DC. Wait, no. If AB is parallel to DC, then the angle between AD and AB is the same as the angle between AD and DC. Wait, no. Let me visualize. 

At point D, we have sides DC and DA. DC is one side, DA is another. The angle between DC and DA is 90 degrees. Now, AB is parallel to DC, and AD is parallel to BC. So the angle between AB and AD would be the same as the angle between DC and DA, because AB || DC and AD is a transversal. So yes, the angle between AB and AD is 90 degrees. Hence, the angle between AB and AD is 90 degrees. Therefore, the height corresponding to base AB is AD, which is y. So the height is y = 5. Hence, y = 5. 

So area = base * height = x * 5. Also, area = ab sin(theta) = x * y * sin(theta). But theta is 90 degrees, so sin(theta) = 1. Hence, area = x * y = x * 5. So consistent. 

But earlier, from the diagonals, we had x² + y² = 156.5. With y = 5, x² = 156.5 - 25 = 131.5. Hence, x = sqrt(131.5) ≈ 11.47. So perimeter is 2*(x + y) ≈ 2*(11.47 + 5) ≈ 32.94. But this is not among the answer choices. 

This suggests that either there is a miscalculation, or the problem has an error. But since this is an exam question, likely I made a mistake. Let me check the diagonal formula again. 

For a parallelogram, the formula for the sum of squares of diagonals is:

AC² + BD² = 2(a² + b²)

Where a and b are the lengths of the sides. Yes, this is correct. So plugging in AC=12 and BD=13:

12² + 13² = 144 + 169 = 313 = 2(a² + b²) ⇒ a² + b² = 313/2 = 156.5.

With y = 5, then x² = 156.5 - 25 = 131.5. So x = sqrt(131.5) ≈ 11.47. 

Perimeter = 2(x + y) ≈ 2*(11.47 + 5) ≈ 32.94. 

But this is not matching any of the answer choices. The closest is A. 25, but that's significantly lower. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in identifying which sides are x and y? Let me confirm. 

In the parallelogram, sides are AB and AD. If angle ADC is 90 degrees, then AD is one side, DC is another. So DC = AB = x, and AD = BC = y. So yes, x and y are the lengths of the sides. 

Alternatively, maybe the height is not y but something else? Let me think again. The height is 5. If the base is DC (length x), then height is 5. If the base is AD (length y), then the height would be x*sin(theta), where theta is the angle between AD and DC. Since theta is 90 degrees, sin(theta) = 1, so height = x. Wait, this is conflicting with previous conclusion. 

Wait, confusion arises here. Let me clarify: 

When calculating the height corresponding to a particular base, it depends on the angle between the sides. For example, if we take base DC (length x), then the height is the distance from DC to AB, which is the length of AD multiplied by sin(angle between AD and DC). Since the angle between AD and DC is 90 degrees, sin(90) = 1, so height = AD = y. Hence, y = 5. 

Alternatively, if we take base AD (length y), then the height is the distance from AD to BC, which would be AB * sin(angle between AB and AD). The angle between AB and AD is the same as angle at A, which is supplementary to angle at D (which is 90 degrees). So angle at A is 90 degrees as well. Hence, sin(angle) = 1, so height = AB = x. 

But the problem says the height is 5. So if the height is 5, it could correspond to either base DC or AD. But since both cases give us that y = 5 or x = 5. But since we have two variables x and y, and one equation from the height, but we need more info. 

Wait, but earlier we assumed that the height corresponds to base DC, giving y = 5. But if the height corresponds to base AD, then x = 5. Let me explore both possibilities.

Case 1: Assume height corresponds to base DC (so y = 5). Then x² + y² = 156.5 ⇒ x² = 156.5 - 25 = 131.5. Perimeter ≈ 2*(x + 5) ≈ 2*(11.47 + 5) ≈ 32.94.

Case 2: Assume height corresponds to base AD (so x = 5). Then x = 5, so y² = 156.5 - x² = 156.5 - 25 = 131.5 ⇒ y = sqrt(131.5) ≈ 11.47. Perimeter is 2*(x + y) = 2*(5 + 11.47) ≈ 32.94. Same result. 

Either way, perimeter is approximately 32.94. Still not matching any answer choices. 

But the answer choices are A. 25, B. 50, C. 60, D. 100. None of these are close. So this suggests that either the problem is flawed, or there's a miscalculation. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in applying the diagonal formula. Let me recheck. The formula is AC² + BD² = 2(a² + b²). Is this correct?

Yes, in a parallelogram, the formula holds. Let me derive it quickly. 

In a parallelogram, the diagonals satisfy:

AC² = a² + b² + 2ab cos(theta)

BD² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(theta)

Adding them together: AC² + BD² = 2a² + 2b². Hence, yes, the formula is correct. 

So with AC = 12, BD = 13, then 12² + 13² = 2(a² + b²) ⇒ 313 = 2(a² + b²) ⇒ a² + b² = 156.5. 

And with one of the sides being 5 (either a or b), the other is sqrt(131.5). 

But the perimeter is 2(a + b) = 2(sqrt(131.5) + 5). Let me calculate this more accurately. 

sqrt(131.5) is approximately 11.467. So adding 5 gives 16.467. Multiply by 2: 32.934. Rounded to the nearest tenth is 32.9. Still not matching any answer choices. 

This suggests that the problem may have a typo, or I'm missing something. Let me revisit the problem statement. 

Wait, the height is 5. Maybe the height is not related to the sides directly? Let me think. If the parallelogram has a right angle at D, then it's a rectangle, but with unequal diagonals. But this is impossible. So perhaps the height is not referring to the height relative to the sides, but something else? 

Alternatively, maybe the height is referring to the distance between the two bases, which would be the same as the length of the side perpendicular to the base. For example, if the base is AB, then the height is the distance from AB to DC, which is AD * sin(theta), where theta is the angle between AD and AB. But since angle ADC is 90 degrees, and angle between AD and DC is 90 degrees, then the angle between AD and AB is supplementary to angle ADC? Wait, no. Let me think carefully. 

In parallelogram ABCD, angle at D is between AD and DC. Since AB is parallel to DC, the angle between AD and AB is the same as the angle between AD and DC, which is 90 degrees. Hence, the height corresponding to base AB is AD, which is y = 5. So this brings us back to the same situation. 

Unless the height is not AD but something else. Wait, perhaps the height is referring to the height of the entire figure, which could be calculated via area divided by base. But without knowing the area, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, maybe I should use the Pythagorean theorem with the diagonals and the height? Let me think. 

If the parallelogram has a right angle at D, then it's a rectangle, but with diagonals of different lengths. This is impossible, but let's pretend it's possible. Let's imagine a rectangle with diagonals 12 and 13. But in a rectangle, diagonals are equal. So this is impossible. Hence, the figure cannot exist. But the problem states it does. Therefore, there must be a different approach. 

Wait, perhaps the parallelogram is not a rectangle, but has a right angle at D, and the other angles are not 90 degrees. How is this possible? 

In a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So if angle at D is 90 degrees, then angle at C is 90 degrees (since it's adjacent to angle D). Then, angle at B would be 90 degrees, and angle at A would be 90 degrees. Hence, all angles are 90 degrees, making it a rectangle. Hence, diagonals must be equal. 

This is a contradiction, but the problem gives unequal diagonals. Hence, the only explanation is that the figure is not a parallelogram, but the problem states it is. This is very confusing. 

Perhaps the given right angle is not between the sides but between a side and a diagonal? No, the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(A,D,C)), which is between points A-D-C, so it's between AD and DC. 

Wait, maybe the problem uses a non-Euclidean geometry? Unlikely, as it's a standard geometry problem. 

Alternatively, perhaps the diagonals are not AC and BD but something else? No, the problem specifies Line(A,C) and Line(B,D). 

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's consider the coordinates. Let me place point D at the origin (0,0). Since angle ADC is 90 degrees, and DC is along the x-axis, DA is along the y-axis. Let me assign coordinates:

Point D: (0, 0)

Since angle ADC is 90 degrees, DC is horizontal and DA is vertical.

Let me define:

Point C: (c, 0) since it's along x-axis from D.

Point A: (0, d) since it's along y-axis from D.

Since ABCD is a parallelogram, vector AB = vector DC. Vector DC is (c, 0) - (0, 0) = (c, 0). So vector AB should also be (c, 0). Point A is at (0, d), so point B is at A + vector AB = (0 + c, d + 0) = (c, d). 

So coordinates:

A: (0, d)

B: (c, d)

C: (c, 0)

D: (0, 0)

Now, diagonals AC and BD:

Diagonal AC: from A(0,d) to C(c,0). Length is sqrt((c-0)^2 + (0-d)^2) = sqrt(c² + d²) = 12.

Diagonal BD: from B(c,d) to D(0,0). Length is sqrt((0-c)^2 + (0-d)^2) = sqrt(c² + d²) = 13.

Wait, but this implies that sqrt(c² + d²) = 12 and sqrt(c² + d²) = 13, which is impossible. Hence, contradiction. 

This confirms that the given conditions are inconsistent. Hence, the problem as stated is impossible. But since it's presented as a problem, there must be a resolution. 

Wait, but the height is given as 5. Let me calculate the height in this coordinate system. The height of the parallelogram is the distance between the lines AB and DC. Since AB is the line from (0,d) to (c,d), which is horizontal at y = d. DC is from (0,0) to (c,0), which is horizontal at y=0. The distance between these lines is d, which is the height. Hence, the height is d = 5. 

So from this, d = 5. 

From diagonal AC: sqrt(c² + d²) = 12. Substituting d = 5: sqrt(c² + 25) = 12 → c² + 25 = 144 → c² = 119 → c = sqrt(119). 

Similarly, diagonal BD: sqrt(c² + d²) = 13. But with d = 5 and c² = 119, this would give sqrt(119 + 25) = sqrt(144) = 12, not 13. Hence, contradiction. 

This shows that the given conditions are impossible. But the problem asks to find the perimeter, suggesting that it is possible. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement, or perhaps the right angle is not at D but somewhere else? 

Wait, the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(A,D,C)), which is angle at D between A-D-C. So in our coordinate system, that's the angle at D between A(0,d) and C(c,0), which is 90 degrees. Hence, the calculation shows that the diagonals must be equal, but the problem says they are 12 and 13. Hence, contradiction. 

Therefore, the problem is ill-posed. However, since it's an exam question, perhaps there's a misinterpretation. Let me consider that the height is not d but something else. 

Wait, in the coordinate system, the height is d = 5. But what if the height refers to something else? For example, the height could be the distance from A to DC, which is d. Or from B to DC, which is also d. Hence, it's definitely d = 5. 

So, with d = 5, c² = 119. Hence, the sides of the parallelogram are AB = c (from (0,d) to (c,d)), which is length c = sqrt(119), and AD = d = 5. Hence, perimeter is 2*(c + d) = 2*(sqrt(119) + 5). 

Let me calculate this: sqrt(119) ≈ 10.9087. Adding 5 gives 15.9087. Multiply by 2: 31.8174. Approximately 31.8, which rounds to 31.8. Still not matching any answer choices. 

But the answer choices are A. 25, B. 50, C. 60, D. 100. 

This suggests that there's a fundamental issue with the problem. However, since I need to choose from the given options, perhaps the intended answer assumes that the diagonals are equal, and there was a typo, and the height is 5, leading to a different calculation. 

Assume that the diagonals are equal, say both 12. Then, from the formula, 2(a² + b²) = 12² + 12² = 288 ⇒ a² + b² = 144. With height 5, if it's a rectangle, then a = 5, b = sqrt(144 - 25) = sqrt(119) ≈ 10.9. Perimeter ≈ 2*(5 + 10.9) ≈ 31.8, still not matching. 

Alternatively, if the height is 5, and the diagonals are 12 and 13, but ignoring the contradiction, and proceeding with the calculation, the perimeter is approximately 32.9, which is closest to 33, but none of the options are close. 

Alternatively, perhaps the height is not 5, but something else. Let me check if there's a misinterpretation of the height. 

The height of a parallelogram is the distance between two opposite sides. In our coordinate system, it's d = 5. But if the height is 5, then d = 5. Hence, the calculation remains. 

Alternatively, perhaps the height is referring to the height of the triangle formed by the diagonal? No, the problem says "HeightOf(Parallelogram(A,B,C,D))", which should refer to the height of the parallelogram itself. 

Given that I'm unable to reconcile the given conditions, but needing to provide an answer, perhaps the intended solution assumes that the diagonals are equal, and there was a mistake in the problem, and the height is 5, leading to a perimeter of 2*(sqrt(119) + 5) ≈ 31.8, which is closest to 32, but none of the options are close. 

Alternatively, perhaps the height is not related to the sides, but to the diagonals? For example, using the height to calculate area, and then using the diagonals to find the sides. Let me try this approach. 

Area of parallelogram = base * height = 5 * base. Also, area can be calculated using the formula involving diagonals and the angle between them. But I don't recall the exact formula. Alternatively, area = (d1 * d2 * sin(theta))/2, where theta is the angle between the diagonals. But without knowing theta, this is not helpful. 

Alternatively, since we know the diagonals and one of the sides, perhaps we can use the law of cosines on the triangles formed by the diagonals. 

In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. So, the intersection point O divides each diagonal into halves. So AO = AC/2 = 6, BO = BD/2 = 6.5. 

In triangle AOD, we have sides AO = 6, OD = 6.5, and AD = 5. Wait, AD is one of the sides, which we previously said is 5. Wait, but in this scenario, AD is a side, and in the coordinate system, it's d = 5. Let me check if this forms a valid triangle. 

Using the triangle with sides 6, 6.5, and 5. Check if these satisfy the triangle inequality: 6 + 5 > 6.5 → 11 > 6.5, yes; 6 + 6.5 > 5, yes; 5 + 6.5 > 6, yes. 

Now, using the Law of Cosines to find the angle at O. But I'm not sure how this helps. 

Alternatively, since we know AD = 5, AO = 6, and OD = 6.5, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the angle between AO and OD. 

But this might not help directly. 

Alternatively, since we know AD = 5, and in the coordinate system, AD is from (0,0) to (0,5), so length 5. The diagonals are AC = 12 and BD = 13. But in this case, AC = sqrt(c² + d²) = 12, and BD = sqrt(c² + d²) = 13, which is impossible. 

Hence, this confirms the contradiction. 

Given that, perhaps the intended answer is B. 50, assuming that the diagonals are 12 and 13, and using the height to find the sides. Let me try to force the numbers. 

If the height is 5, and the diagonals are 12 and 13, then using the formula for the area as base * height. Let's assume the base is x, then area = x * 5. Also, area can be found using the diagonals and the angle between them: Area = (d1 * d2 * sin(theta))/2. But without knowing theta, this is not
