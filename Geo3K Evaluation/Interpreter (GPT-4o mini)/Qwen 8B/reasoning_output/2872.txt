MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, C, D, and they're all points. There's a circle with center A, and points B, C, D lie on that circle. Also, there's an angle ∠D B C, and its measure is given? Wait, no—the MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,C)) isn't directly given. But wait, there's another predicate: Equals(MeasureOf(Arc(D,C)),218). Hmm. The question is asking for the measure of angle 1, but I need to figure out which angle that refers to. Since the angle mentioned is ∠D B C, maybe angle 1 is that same angle?

Wait, the problem says "Find the measure of m∠1." But the only angle mentioned in the predicates is ∠D B C. Maybe angle 1 is referring to that angle? Or perhaps it's another angle formed by those points?

Let me start by analyzing the given information. Points B, C, D are all on the circle centered at A. So, AB, AC, AD are radii of the circle. Therefore, AB = AC = AD since they're radii. That means triangle ABC, ABD, ACD are all isosceles triangles. 

Now, considering arc DC measures 218 degrees. In a circle, the measure of an arc corresponds to the central angle subtended by that arc. So, if arc DC is 218°, then the central angle ∠DAC would be 218°, because the central angle equals the measure of its arc. Wait, but point A is the center, so yes, connecting A to D and C gives us the central angle. So ∠DAC is 218°, which is the central angle corresponding to arc DC.

But how does this relate to angle ∠DBC? Let me visualize this. Points B, C, D are on the circumference. So, angle ∠DBC is an inscribed angle. Wait, but where is point B located? It's also on the circle. So, angle DBC is formed by points D, B, C. So vertex at B, with segments BD and BC. To find the measure of this angle, we can use the inscribed angle theorem. However, the inscribed angle depends on the arc that it intercepts.

Inscribed angle theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So, angle DBC intercepts arc DC. Wait, but let me confirm. When you have an inscribed angle with vertex at B, the intercepted arc is the arc opposite the angle, which would be arc DC. Because the angle is formed by points D and C, so the intercepted arc is DC. Therefore, the measure of angle DBC should be half of arc DC. But arc DC is 218°, so angle DBC would be 218 / 2 = 109°. 

So, if angle DBC is 109°, then that would be the measure of angle 1, assuming angle 1 refers to ∠DBC. Looking at the answer choices, option C is 109. Therefore, the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check. Is angle DBC indeed intercepting arc DC? Let me think again. The inscribed angle at point B intercepts the arc that's opposite, which is arc DC. Yes, because the angle is formed by points D and C, so the intercepted arc is DC. Hence, measure is half of arc DC. Arc DC is 218°, so angle is 109°, which is option C. 

Alternatively, could there be something wrong here? For example, if the arc was major or minor arc. But since the measure is 218°, which is more than 180°, so it's the major arc DC. But inscribed angles typically refer to the arcs that are less than 180° unless specified otherwise. Wait, but the intercepted arc for an inscribed angle is the arc that's not containing the angle. Wait, actually, the intercepted arc is the one that's opposite the angle. So if the angle is at point B, then the intercepted arc is DC, which is the arc that doesn't contain point B. But since points B, C, D are all on the circle, depending on their arrangement, the arc DC could be either the major or minor arc. But since the measure is given as 218°, which is the measure of the arc DC, so that's the arc that's intercepted by angle DBC. Therefore, even though it's a major arc, the inscribed angle still takes half of that. So 218 divided by 2 is 109°, which is option C. So the answer is C.
