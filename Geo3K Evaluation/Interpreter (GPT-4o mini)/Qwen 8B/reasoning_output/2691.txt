Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a triangle QRS, and it's given that the lengths of the sides are related to x. Also, the triangle is isosceles. The question is asking for QS, which I think refers to the length of the side opposite vertex R? Wait, maybe I need to clarify the points first.

First, let me parse the given information. The Triangle(Q,R,S) means there's a triangle with vertices Q, R, and S. Then, the LengthOf(Line(Q,R)) is 5x. So QR = 5x. Then LengthOf(Line(R,S)) is 6x - 5, so RS = 6x - 5. And LengthOf(Line(Q,S)) is 3x + 10, so QS = 3x + 10. Wait, but the question asks for QS, which would be 3x + 10. But since the triangle is isosceles, two sides must be equal. So I need to figure out which sides are equal here.

An isosceles triangle has two equal sides. Let's consider the possibilities. The sides are QR = 5x, RS = 6x -5, and QS = 3x + 10. Since it's isosceles, two of these must be equal. There are three cases:

Case 1: QR = RS → 5x = 6x -5 → Solving gives x = 5. Then check if other sides make sense. Let's compute each side: QR=5*5=25, RS=6*5 -5=25, QS=3*5 +10=25. Wait, all three sides would be 25? That would make it equilateral, which is a special case of isosceles. But the problem states it's isosceles, so maybe that's allowed. However, let me check other cases too.

Case 2: QR = QS → 5x = 3x +10 → 2x =10 → x=5. Then QR=25, QS=25, RS=6*5 -5=25 again. Same as before. All sides equal. Hmm.

Case 3: RS = QS → 6x -5 = 3x +10 → 3x =15 → x=5. Again same result. So regardless of which pair we choose, x=5. Therefore, substituting back, QS is 3x +10 = 3*5 +10 = 15 +10 =25. So the answer should be 25, which is option D.

Wait, but let me confirm if there are other possibilities where maybe the triangle isn't equilateral. For example, suppose that the two equal sides are not the ones directly compared in those equations. Wait, but in an isosceles triangle, exactly two sides are equal. However, if all three are equal, it's still considered isosceles. So even though all sides are equal here, it's acceptable. Hence, x=5 leads to all sides being 25, making it equilateral, which is also isosceles. Therefore, the value of QS is 25, which corresponds to option D. 

But wait, looking at the answer options, D is 25. So the answer should be D. Let me check once more. The problem says Isosceles(Triangle(Q,R,S)). So even if all sides are equal, it's still valid. So yes, x=5, so QS=3x+10=25. So Final Answer: D.
