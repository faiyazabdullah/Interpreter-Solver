MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse the given predicates and understand what each one means. 

So, we have a rhombus A, B, C, D. Wait, the first predicate says Rhombus(A,B,C,D) and then another Rhombus(A). Hmm, maybe that's a typo? Or perhaps it's referring to different things. Let me check again. Oh, maybe the second one is just stating that A is a rhombus? Because a rhombus is defined by four points, so maybe the first predicate defines the rhombus with vertices A, B, C, D, and the second predicate is saying that A itself is a rhombus? That doesn't quite make sense because A is a point. Maybe there's confusion here. Alternatively, maybe the second predicate is meant to indicate that figure A is a rhombus, but that would require more context. Let me try to focus on the other parts.

Next, we have Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,A)), 40). So the length of the line segment BA is 40 units. Then Equals(AreaOf(A,B,C,D), 400). So the area of the rhombus ABCD is 400. Also, Equals(AreaOf(A), 64). Wait, AreaOf(A)? If A is a point, how does that make sense? Unless there's a misunderstanding here. Maybe the second part refers to the area of a different shape associated with A. Alternatively, could it be that the AreaOf(A) refers to the area of a square or another figure where A is a vertex? This is confusing. But since the first part mentions a rhombus ABCD, maybe AreaOf(A) is referring to another figure, perhaps a square or another rhombus?

Then, Equals(SideOf(Rhombus(A)), x). So the side length of the rhombus A is x. Wait, if A is a point, how can it be a rhombus? There's inconsistency here. Perhaps there's a misinterpretation. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

Wait, maybe the predicates are structured differently. For example, the first line says "Rhombus(A,B,C,D)" which defines a rhombus with vertices A, B, C, D. Then "Rhombus(A)" might refer to another rhombus, perhaps with some relation to point A. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, given the rest of the information, maybe the key is focusing on the rhombus ABCD and another figure related to A.

Alternatively, perhaps "AreaOf(A)" refers to the area of a square whose side is related to A? Or maybe A represents a square? But the problem mentions similar figures, so maybe there's two similar figures involved: the rhombus ABCD and another figure, possibly a square, since AreaOf(A) is 64. Let me think.

Let me list out all the given info again:

1. Rhombus(A,B,C,D): So ABCD is a rhombus.
2. Length of BA is 40 units.
3. Area of ABCD is 400.
4. Area of A is 64.
5. Side of Rhombus(A) is x. Wait, if "Rhombus(A)" refers to another rhombus where A is one of its sides? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a square or another rhombus associated with point A. Since the problem mentions similar figures, perhaps there are two similar figures: the rhombus ABCD and another figure (maybe a square or another rhombus) with area 64, and we need to find x, which is the side length of the rhombus mentioned in the last predicate.

But the last predicate is "Equals(SideOf(Rhombus(A)), x)". So if "Rhombus(A)" is a rhombus with side x, then maybe there's another rhombus related to A, which has area 64. But how does that connect with the first rhombus ABCD?

Alternatively, maybe "A" is a square, and the rhombus ABCD has an area of 400, while the square A has an area of 64. Then, since they're similar figures, we can relate their areas to find the side length of the rhombus.

But wait, squares and rhombuses aren't necessarily similar unless the rhombus is a square. However, the problem states they are similar figures. So if the square A has area 64, then its side length is sqrt(64)=8. The rhombus ABCD has area 400. If they are similar, the ratio of areas would be the square of the ratio of corresponding sides.

But the problem mentions "the pair of similar figures"â€”so likely the rhombus ABCD and another figure (possibly the square A) are similar. Therefore, the area ratio would be 400 / 64 = 6.25. Taking the square root gives the scale factor, which is 2.5. Then, if the side of the square is 8, the side of the rhombus would be 8 * 2.5 = 20. But none of the options is 20. Hmm, that doesn't match. So maybe my assumption is wrong.

Wait, but the problem says "use the given areas to find x", where x is the side of the rhombus A. Let me go back.

Given that the rhombus ABCD has area 400. Also, the length of BA is 40. In a rhombus, all sides are equal, so each side is 40. Then the area of a rhombus is base times height, or equivalently, (diagonal1 * diagonal2)/2. But also, area can be expressed as side^2 * sin(theta), where theta is one of the interior angles.

Since the area is 400, and side is 40, then 40^2 * sin(theta) = 400 => 1600 sin(theta) = 400 => sin(theta) = 0.25. So theta = arcsin(0.25), which is approximately 14.47 degrees.

Now, the other part: AreaOf(A) is 64. Assuming A refers to another figure, maybe a square, since the area is given. If A is a square, then its side is 8. Now, if the rhombus ABCD and the square A are similar, then the ratio of their areas would be (area of rhombus)/(area of square) = 400/64 = 6.25. The ratio of areas is the square of the ratio of corresponding sides. So the ratio of sides would be sqrt(6.25) = 2.5. Therefore, the side of the rhombus (which is 40) should be 2.5 times the side of the square (which is 8). But 2.5*8=20, which isn't among the options. So something's wrong here.

Wait, but the question asks for x, which is the side of the rhombus A. Wait, earlier I thought the rhombus was ABCD with side 40, but maybe the predicate "SideOf(Rhombus(A))" refers to a different rhombus. Let me re-express the given predicates carefully:

Predicates:

- Rhombus(A,B,C,D): So ABCD is a rhombus.

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,A)), 40): So BA = 40.

- Equals(AreaOf(A,B,C,D), 400): So area of rhombus ABCD is 400.

- Equals(AreaOf(A), 64): So area of A is 64. Here, A is probably a square, since area is given and it's a single entity.

- Equals(SideOf(Rhombus(A)), x): So the side length of the rhombus A is x. Wait, but A is already a point in the first predicate. How can A be a rhombus? Unless there's a misinterpretation here. Maybe the second predicate is supposed to say "Rhombus(A)" instead of "Rhombus(A,B,C,D)", making two separate rhombuses: one being ABCD and another being A. But that still doesn't make sense because A is a point. Alternatively, maybe there's a typo and "Rhombus(A,B,C,D)" is intended to define a rhombus named A, with vertices B, C, D? No, that seems odd.

Alternatively, perhaps "A" is a rhombus, and the other points are its vertices. So maybe the rhombus is named A, with vertices B, C, D, and another point? But the way it's written is ambiguous. Given that, perhaps the problem is mistyped, but I have to work with what's given.

Assuming that "Rhombus(A,B,C,D)" means that A is a rhombus with vertices labeled B, C, D, but that's unclear. Alternatively, maybe "A" is a rhombus, and B, C, D are points on it. But this is too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps "Rhombus(A)" refers to a rhombus where A is one of its vertices, and the other vertices are B, C, D. But again, not sure. Given the ambiguity, perhaps I need to proceed with the assumption that the rhombus ABCD has side length 40, area 400, and another figure (a square?) with area 64, and find the relationship between them.

Wait, the question says "for the pair of similar figures". So there are two similar figures. One of them is the rhombus ABCD with area 400, and the other is a figure with area 64. The problem wants us to find x, which is the side of the rhombus A. Maybe the "rhombus A" refers to another rhombus that is similar to ABCD, and has area 64. Then, using similarity ratios, compute x.

But if the rhombus ABCD has area 400, and another similar rhombus has area 64, then the ratio of areas is 64/400 = 4/25. The ratio of sides would be sqrt(4/25) = 2/5. So if the original rhombus has side length s, then the smaller one has side length (2/5)s. But in our case, the original rhombus ABCD has side length 40, so the smaller rhombus would have side length (2/5)*40 = 16. Hence, x would be 16, which is option B.

But why would the area of A be 64? If "A" refers to the smaller rhombus, then yes. But in the given predicates, the area of A is 64. So assuming that "A" is the smaller rhombus, then x would be its side length, which would be 16. That fits with option B.

Let me verify this again. The area of the larger rhombus (ABCD) is 400, and the area of the smaller rhombus (A) is 64. Since they are similar, the ratio of areas is 64/400 = 16/100 = 4/25. So the ratio of sides is sqrt(4/25) = 2/5. Therefore, if the larger rhombus has side length 40, then the smaller one has side length 40*(2/5) = 16. Thus, x is 16. Which is option B.

Therefore, the answer should be B.
