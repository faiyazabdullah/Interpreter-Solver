Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have several given predicates about angles and lengths. Let me start by breaking down each part step by step.

First, the problem mentions RightAngle(Angle(A, D, C)) and RightAngle(Angle(D, B, C)). That means two right angles at points D and C? Wait, maybe I need to visualize this. Let me sketch mentally. Points A, B, C, D are involved here. 

So, Angle(A, D, C) being a right angle implies that at point D, the angle formed by points A, D, C is 90 degrees. Similarly, Angle(D, B, C) is also a right angle, so at point B, the angle formed by D, B, C is 90 degrees. Hmm, but wait, the angle notation is usually vertex in the middle. So Angle(A, D, C) would be angle at D between AD and DC. Similarly, Angle(D, B, C) is angle at B between DB and BC. So these two right angles are at different vertices.

Then there's Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A, D, B)), 36). So the measure of angle at D between A, D, B is 36 degrees. So angle ADB is 36°. Also, LengthOf(Line(B, D)) is 6x, LengthOf(Line(D, C)) is x, LengthOf(Line(A,B)) is z, and LengthOf(Line(A,C)) is y. We need to find x.

Let me try to imagine or draw this configuration. Let me consider points D and B connected by BD = 6x. Then DC is x. Also, angle at D between A, D, B is 36°, and angle at D between A, D, C is 90° (from the first right angle). Wait, if angle ADC is 90°, then angle ADC is right angle. But angle ADB is 36°, so perhaps points A, D, B, C form some structure?

Wait, maybe triangle ADC has a right angle at D, and triangle DBC has a right angle at B? Or maybe there's a quadrilateral involved? Let me think again.

Since angle ADC is a right angle (from the first predicate), so triangle ADC is right-angled at D. And angle DBC is a right angle (second predicate), so triangle DBC is right-angled at B. Also, angle ADB is 36°, which is part of triangle ABD?

Alternatively, perhaps there are two right triangles sharing a common side? For example, triangle ADC and triangle DBC. Let me try to map the points.

Assume point D is connected to A, B, and C. Since angle ADC is 90°, so DA perpendicular to DC. Also, angle DBC is 90°, so DB perpendicular to BC. Also, angle ADB is 36°, which would mean that in triangle ABD, angle at D is 36°, and since angle ADC is 90°, maybe there's a relationship between those triangles?

Wait, let's note the coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates could help. Let me place point D at origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since angle ADC is right angle, DC is along x-axis, and DA is along y-axis. So suppose D is at (0,0), C is at (x, 0) because DC length is x. Then DA is vertical, so point A is at (0, y_A) where y_A is some length. Wait, but we don't know AC's length yet; it's given as y. So AC connects A to C, which is from (0, y_A) to (x, 0). The length of AC is sqrt(x² + y_A²) = y. So that's one equation.

Now, considering the other right angle: angle DBC is right angle. Point B is somewhere such that angle at B between D, B, C is 90°. So triangle DBC is right-angled at B. Therefore, BD is perpendicular to BC. Given that BD length is 6x. Let me assign coordinates to B. Since D is at (0,0) and C is at (x, 0), then BC is perpendicular to BD. So BD vector is from B to D? Wait, angle at B is between D, B, C. So BD and BC are the legs of the right angle at B. So BD is from B to D, and BC is from B to C. Therefore, BD ⊥ BC. So vectors BD and BC are perpendicular.

Let me denote coordinates for B as (p, q). Then vector BD is D - B = (0 - p, 0 - q) = (-p, -q). Vector BC is C - B = (x - p, 0 - q) = (x - p, -q). Their dot product should be zero because they are perpendicular. So:

(-p)(x - p) + (-q)(-q) = 0  
=> -px + p² + q² = 0  
=> p² - px + q² = 0.

Also, the length of BD is sqrt(p² + q²) = 6x. So p² + q² = (6x)^2 = 36x².

Substituting into previous equation: 36x² - px = 0 => px = 36x² => p = 36x (assuming x ≠ 0).

Therefore, p = 36x. So coordinate of B is (36x, q). Now, since p² + q² = 36x², substituting p=36x gives:

(36x)^2 + q^2 = 36x²  
=> 1296x² + q² = 36x²  
=> q² = 36x² - 1296x² = -1260x².

Wait, that's impossible because q² can't be negative. Did I make a mistake here?

Hmm, that suggests inconsistency. Which means my assumption about the direction of vectors may be wrong. Maybe I mixed up the vectors. Let me check again.

Vector BD is from B to D: D - B = (0 - p, 0 - q) = (-p, -q). Vector BC is from B to C: C - B = (x - p, 0 - q) = (x - p, -q). Their dot product is (-p)(x - p) + (-q)(-q) = -px + p² + q² = 0. So p² - px + q² = 0. But BD's length squared is p² + q² = (6x)^2 = 36x². So substituting into p² + q² = 36x² into the equation p² - px + q² = 0 gives 36x² - px = 0 → px = 36x² → p = 36x. Then plugging back into p² + q² = 36x² gives (36x)^2 + q² = 36x² ⇒ q² = 36x² - 1296x² = -1260x². Negative value, which is impossible. So contradiction arises here. What does that imply?

Perhaps my coordinate assignment is incorrect. Maybe I placed the points incorrectly. Alternatively, perhaps the right angle is at B, but BC isn't horizontal. Wait, maybe I need to adjust how I set up coordinates. Let me try another approach.

Alternative setup: Let me consider triangle DBC with right angle at B. So BD and BC are perpendicular. Suppose BD is vertical and BC is horizontal? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe I should use trigonometry with the given angles.

We have angle ADB is 36°, which is part of triangle ABD. In triangle ABD, angle at D is 36°, and BD is 6x. Also, in triangle ADC, which is right-angled at D, DA and DC are perpendicular. So DA is perpendicular to DC. Let me consider triangle ADC: right-angled at D, so DA^2 + DC^2 = AC^2. From the given, DC = x, AC = y. So DA^2 + x² = y². Therefore, DA = sqrt(y² - x²).

But how does this relate to the rest? Also, in triangle ABD, angle at D is 36°, sides adjacent to that angle are DA and DB. Wait, angle ADB is 36°, so in triangle ABD, angle at D is 36°, with sides DA, DB, AB. So using the Law of Sines or Cosines here?

Law of Sines: In triangle ABD, sin(angle at D)/AB = sin(angle at A)/BD. Wait, but I don't know the angles. Alternatively, maybe Law of Cosines. Let me think.

In triangle ABD, angle at D is 36°, sides around it are DA and DB. So DA is adjacent to angle D, and DB is adjacent. Wait, actually, the sides forming the angle at D are DA and DB. So DA and DB are the two sides enclosing the 36° angle. Wait, but DA is connected to D and A, and DB is connected to D and B. So yes, in triangle ABD, angle at D is 36°, with sides DA and DB. Therefore, applying the Law of Cosines:

AB² = DA² + DB² - 2*DA*DB*cos(36°)

But AB is given as z. So:

z² = DA² + (6x)² - 2*(DA)*(6x)*cos(36°)

But from earlier, in triangle ADC, DA² + x² = y². So DA² = y² - x². Substituting into above:

z² = (y² - x²) + 36x² - 12x*DA*cos(36°)

Simplify:

z² = y² + 35x² - 12x*DA*cos(36°)

Hmm, but this seems complicated without more relations. Perhaps there's another way. Let me recall that there's also the right angle at B in triangle DBC. So triangle DBC is right-angled at B. Therefore, by Pythagoras:

BD² + BC² = DC² ?

Wait, no. In a right-angled triangle, the sum of squares of the legs equals hypotenuse squared. Here, right angle at B, so legs are BD and BC, hypotenuse is DC. Wait, DC is given as x. Wait, DC is the side opposite the right angle? No, DC is the segment connecting D to C, which in triangle DBC would be the hypotenuse if right-angled at B. So DC² = BD² + BC².

But BD is 6x, so DC² = (6x)^2 + BC². But DC is given as x, so:

x² = (6x)^2 + BC² → x² = 36x² + BC² → BC² = x² - 36x² = -35x². Again, impossible! This suggests a contradiction, implying that my assumptions about the configuration are wrong.

This indicates that there's an error in how I'm interpreting the points' arrangement. Maybe the right angle at B is not involving DC? Or perhaps the segments are not as I thought. Let me re-examine the original predicates.

Original predicates:

RightAngle(Angle(A, D, C)): So angle at D between A-D-C is right angle. So AD perpendicular to DC.

RightAngle(Angle(D, B, C)): Angle at B between D-B-C is right angle. So BD perpendicular to BC.

Additionally, MeasureOf(Angle(A, D, B)) is 36°, so angle at D between A-D-B is 36°, i.e., angle ADB is 36°.

So points A, D, B, C are arranged such that:

- At D, AD is perpendicular to DC (right angle).
- At B, BD is perpendicular to BC (right angle).
- Angle between AD and BD at D is 36°.

Maybe the diagram involves overlapping triangles. Let me think of triangle ABD and triangle CBD.

From angle ADB = 36°, and AD ⊥ DC. Also, BD ⊥ BC. So maybe there's a connection between these triangles.

Let me try to find relations between the triangles. For instance, since AD ⊥ DC, and BD ⊥ BC, perhaps there's a way to express slopes or something.

Alternatively, consider triangle ABD and triangle CBD. Wait, but how?

Wait, let me try using coordinates again, but carefully. Let me place point D at (0, 0). Since angle ADC is right angle, so DC is along x-axis, DA is along y-axis. Let me define:

- D = (0, 0)
- C = (c, 0), so DC = c units. But given DC = x, so c = x. Hence, C = (x, 0)
- A = (0, a), since DA is vertical, so DA = a units. Then AC connects (0,a) to (x,0), so AC length is sqrt(x² + a²) = y.

Now, angle ADB is 36°, which is the angle at D between points A, D, B. So point B lies somewhere such that angle ADB = 36°. Also, angle DBC is right angle, so at point B, angle between D-B-C is 90°, meaning that BD is perpendicular to BC.

Let me find coordinates of B. Let me assume B has coordinates (p, q). Then:

First, angle ADB is 36°. The vectors DA and DB are:

DA: from D to A is (0, a) - (0, 0) = (0, a)
DB: from D to B is (p, q) - (0, 0) = (p, q)

The angle between DA and DB is 36°, so using the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (DA · DB) / (|DA| |DB|)

DA · DB = 0*p + a*q = aq

|DA| = sqrt(0² + a²) = a

|DB| = sqrt(p² + q²)

Thus,

cos(36°) = (aq) / (a * sqrt(p² + q²)) ) = q / sqrt(p² + q²)

So:

q / sqrt(p² + q²) = cos(36°)

Square both sides:

q² / (p² + q²) = cos²(36°)

Rearranged:

q² = cos²(36°) (p² + q²)

q² = cos²(36°) p² + cos²(36°) q²

Bring terms together:

q² - cos²(36°) q² = cos²(36°) p²

q² (1 - cos²(36°)) = cos²(36°) p²

Using identity 1 - cos²θ = sin²θ:

q² sin²(36°) = cos²(36°) p²

Divide both sides by cos²(36°):

(q² / cos²(36°)) sin²(36°) = p²

Which simplifies to:

(q tan(36°))^2 = p²

Thus, q tan(36°) = ±p. Assuming standard position, let's take positive for simplicity, so q = p / tan(36°).

So coordinates of B satisfy q = p / tan(36°). Let's keep this relation.

Next, the second condition: angle DBC is right angle. So at point B, angle between D-B and C-B is 90°, meaning that vectors BD and BC are perpendicular.

Vector BD is D - B = (0 - p, 0 - q) = (-p, -q)

Vector BC is C - B = (x - p, 0 - q) = (x - p, -q)

Their dot product must be zero:

(-p)(x - p) + (-q)(-q) = 0

Expanding:

-p(x - p) + q² = 0

→ -px + p² + q² = 0

→ p² - px + q² = 0

Earlier, we found that q = p / tan(36°). Let's substitute q into this equation.

Let me compute q²:

q² = p² / tan²(36°)

So:

p² - px + p² / tan²(36°) = 0

Factor out p²:

p²[1 + 1/tan²(36°)] - px = 0

Note that 1 + 1/tan²θ = sec²θ, since 1 + cot²θ = csc²θ, but here it's 1 + 1/tan²θ = 1 + cot²θ = csc²θ. Wait, tanθ = sinθ/cosθ, so 1/tanθ = cotθ. Thus, 1 + 1/tan²θ = 1 + cot²θ = csc²θ.

Thus, the equation becomes:

p² * csc²(36°) - px = 0

Multiply through by sin²(36°):

p² - px sin²(36°) = 0

So:

p² = px sin²(36°)

Assuming p ≠ 0, divide both sides by p:

p = x sin²(36°)

So p = x sin²(36°). Then q = p / tan(36°) = x sin²(36°) / tan(36°)

Recall that tanθ = sinθ / cosθ, so:

q = x sin²(36°) / (sin(36°)/cos(36°)) ) = x sin(36°) cos(36°)

Thus, coordinates of B are (p, q) = (x sin²(36°), x sin(36°) cos(36°))

Now, we can find BD's length. BD is from D(0,0) to B(p,q), so:

BD² = p² + q² = [x² sin⁴(36°)] + [x² sin²(36°) cos²(36°)] = x² sin²(36°)[sin²(36°) + cos²(36°)] = x² sin²(36°)

Thus, BD = x sin(36°)

But according to the given, BD = 6x. So:

x sin(36°) = 6x → sin(36°) = 6 → which is impossible, since sin(36°) ≈ 0.5878 < 1. Contradiction again!

Wait, that suggests there's a fundamental flaw in the setup. How can BD be 6x while our calculation shows BD = x sin(36°)? There's a miscalculation here. Let me double-check.

Earlier, we had:

After finding p = x sin²(36°), and q = x sin(36°) cos(36°), then BD length squared is p² + q² = x² sin^4(36°) + x² sin²(36°) cos²(36°) = x² sin²(36°)[sin²(36°) + cos²(36°)] = x² sin²(36°). Therefore, BD = x sin(36°). But the given says BD = 6x. So equating:

x sin(36°) = 6x → sin(36°) = 6 → which is impossible. Clearly, something is wrong here. Where did I go wrong?

Ah! Wait, I think I made a mistake in the derivation of p. Let me revisit the equation.

We had earlier:

p² - px + q² = 0, with q = p / tan(36°)

So substituting q² = p² / tan²(36°), leading to:

p² - px + p² / tan²(36°) = 0

Which became:

p² (1 + 1/tan²(36°)) = px

Then, since 1 + 1/tan²θ = 1 + cot²θ = csc²θ, so:

p² csc²(36°) = px → p = x sin²(36°)

Yes, that's correct. So BD length is sqrt(p² + q²) = x sin(36°), but according to the problem, BD = 6x. So x sin(36°) = 6x → sin(36°)=6, which is impossible. This suggests that either the problem has inconsistent data, or my interpretation is wrong.

But the problem must be solvable, so likely my interpretation of the points' arrangement is incorrect. Let me reconsider the initial assumptions.

Maybe the angle ADB is not part of triangle ABD but something else? Or maybe the points are arranged differently. Perhaps A, B, C, D form a quadrilateral with certain properties?

Wait, let's consider that angle ADC is right angle, and angle DBC is right angle. So maybe there's a rectangle or some other shape. Alternatively, maybe A, B, D, C form a trapezoid or something.

Another idea: Could the triangles ADC and DBC share the side DC? Wait, DC is part of both triangles? Let me think. Triangle ADC has DC as one leg, and triangle DBC has DC as hypotenuse? Because in triangle DBC, right-angled at B, DC would be the hypotenuse. So DC² = DB² + BC². But DC is given as x, DB is 6x. So x² = (6x)^2 + BC² → BC² = x² - 36x² = -35x². Still impossible. So this suggests that my understanding of which triangle is right-angled is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the right angle in DBC is not at B, but at C? No, the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(D, B, C)), which is angle at B. So it's definitely right-angled at B. So this leads to contradiction unless x=0, which is invalid.

This implies that there's an error in my assumptions about the configuration. Perhaps the points are not in the order I assumed. Let me try to think differently.

What if the right angle at B is not involving DC, but another side? Like, maybe BC is a vertical line and BD is horizontal? Let me try another coordinate system.

Let me try placing point B at (0,0), since it's the vertex of the right angle. So angle DBC is right angle at B. So BD and BC are perpendicular. Let me set B at (0,0). Let me define:

- B = (0, 0)
- Since angle DBC is right angle, let me set BD along x-axis and BC along y-axis. So:
   - D is at (d, 0)
   - C is at (0, c)
- Then BD length is d (since from B(0,0) to D(d,0)), and BC length is c.

Given that BD = 6x, so d = 6x.

Also, DC is the segment from D(d, 0) to C(0, c). Its length is sqrt((d)^2 + (c)^2) = x. So:

sqrt(d² + c²) = x → d² + c² = x². But d = 6x, so:

(6x)^2 + c² = x² → 36x² + c² = x² → c² = -35x². Again, impossible. Same issue.

This suggests that the configuration as per the given predicates is impossible unless x=0, which is not allowed. This must mean that my interpretation of the points is wrong. Let me look back at the original problem statement.

Wait, the problem states:

RightAngle(Angle(A, D, C)) → angle at D between A, D, C is right angle.

RightAngle(Angle(D, B, C)) → angle at B between D, B, C is right angle.

MeasureOf(Angle(A, D, B)) is 36° → angle at D between A, D, B is 36°.

So, points A, D, B, C are such that:

- At D: AD perpendicular to DC.
- At B: BD perpendicular to BC.
- Angle between AD and BD at D is 36°.

Maybe the points are not in the same plane? No, it's a geometry problem, so planar.

Let me try to consider vectors. At point D, AD and DC are perpendicular. At point B, BD and BC are perpendicular. Let me see if there's a relationship between these.

Let me think of vectors. Let me denote vectors:

At D: vector DA and DC are perpendicular. So DA · DC = 0.

At B: vector BD and BC are perpendicular. So BD · BC = 0.

Also, angle between DA and DB at D is 36°, so the angle between vectors DA and DB is 36°.

But how to combine these?

Let me denote vectors:

Let me set D as origin. So position vectors:

- Vector DA = A - D = vector A
- Vector DC = C - D = vector C
- Vector DB = B - D = vector B
- Vector BC = C - B

Given that DA · DC = 0 (since AD ⊥ DC).

Also, BD · BC = 0 → (B - D) · (C - B) = 0. Since D is origin, B is vector B, C is vector C. So (B) · (C - B) = 0 → B · C - |B|² = 0 → B · C = |B|².

Also, the angle between DA (vector A) and DB (vector B) is 36°, so:

cos(36°) = (A · B) / (|A| |B|)

Now, let me try to find relationships between these.

We also know that BD = 6x → |B| = 6x.

DC = x → |C| = x.

AC = y → |C - A| = y.

AB = z → |B - A| = z.

But how to connect these?

From DA · DC = 0 → A · C = 0.

From B · C = |B|² = (6x)^2 = 36x².

Also, from angle between A and B: A · B = |A||B| cos(36°).

Let me write down equations:

1. A · C = 0
2. B · C = 36x²
3. A · B = |A| |B| cos(36°) = |A| * 6x * cos(36°)
4. |C| = x
5. |B| = 6x
6. |C - A| = y
7. |B - A| = z

Our goal is to find x.

Let me try to express C in terms of A and B. From equation 1: A · C = 0 → C is perpendicular to A.

From equation 2: B · C = 36x².

Let me assume that C is a vector perpendicular to A, and satisfies B · C = 36x². Let me express C as a scalar multiple of some vector. Since A · C = 0, C is in the direction perpendicular to A. Let me choose coordinates where A is along y-axis. Let me set A = (0, a), so that DA is along y-axis. Then C is perpendicular to A, so it must be along x-axis. So C = (c, 0), with |C| = x → c = x or -x. Let's say C = (x, 0) for simplicity.

Now, B · C = 36x². Since C = (x, 0), B · C = x * B_x + 0 * B_y = x * B_x = 36x² → B_x = 36x.

So B has x-coordinate 36x. Let me denote B = (36x, b), where b is some number.

Now, we also know that |B| = 6x → sqrt((36x)^2 + b^2) = 6x → square both sides:

(36x)^2 + b² = 36x² → 1296x² + b² = 36x² → b² = -1260x². Again, impossible.

Same contradiction as before. This suggests that under the current setup, the conditions are contradictory. This implies that either there's a misinterpretation of the problem, or perhaps the given data includes a typo, or I'm missing something crucial.

Wait, perhaps the angle ADB is not in the same plane? No, it's a geometry problem, so it must be planar.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle at D between A, D, B is 36°, but in three dimensions? Unlikely, as it's a standard geometry problem.

Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the angle notation. Let me confirm: Angle(A, D, B) is the angle at D between points A, D, B. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, maybe the right angles are not both in the same figure? Or perhaps there are multiple triangles involved. Let me try to think of another approach.

Let me consider triangle ABD, where angle at D is 36°, and triangle ADC is right-angled at D. Also, triangle DBC is right-angled at B. Let me try to find relationships between the sides.

In triangle ADC: right-angled at D, so AD² + DC² = AC² → AD² + x² = y².

In triangle DBC: right-angled at B, so BD² + BC² = DC² → (6x)^2 + BC² = x² → BC² = x² - 36x² = -35x². Again, impossible.

This suggests that the given conditions are conflicting, unless x is imaginary, which is not possible. This implies that there's an error in the problem statement or my misinterpretation.

Wait, but the problem is from a test, so it must be solvable. Let me recheck the predicates.

Wait, the problem says "Equals(LengthOf(Line(B, D)), 6x)" — is it possible that Line(B, D) is not BD but something else? No, Line(B, D) is the same as Line(D, B). So BD length is 6x.

Wait, could there be a miscalculation in the earlier steps? Let me try once more.

Suppose in triangle DBC, right-angled at B, so DC is the hypotenuse. So DC² = BD² + BC². But DC is given as x, BD is 6x. So x² = (6x)^2 + BC² → BC² = x² - 36x² = -35x². Impossible. So this suggests that the only way this is possible is if x=0, which is invalid. Hence, the problem must have a different configuration.

Wait, maybe the right angle is at C instead of B? Let me read the predicate again: RightAngle(Angle(D, B, C)) → angle at B between D, B, C. So it's definitely at B.

Wait, perhaps the length of DC is not x, but something else? No, the predicate says Equals(LengthOf(Line(D, C)), x). So DC is x.

Wait, let me think outside the box. What if the right angle at B is not part of triangle DBC, but another triangle? For example, maybe triangle ABC is right-angled at B? No, the predicate specifies Angle(D, B, C).

Wait, perhaps the points are arranged such that D is inside some figure? Or maybe the right angles are not in the same triangle? Let me try to think of a scenario where both right angles exist.

Let me consider a rectangle or something. Suppose we have a rectangle with points D and B as corners. But not sure.

Alternatively, let me consider that angle ADC is right angle, and angle DBC is right angle, but these are separate right angles. Let me try to construct such a figure.

Imagine point D, with AD perpendicular to DC. So AD and DC are perpendicular. Let me imagine AD going up, DC going right. Now, at point B, which is somewhere such that BD is perpendicular to BC. Let me place B somewhere such that BD is perpendicular to BC. 

Let me try to imagine that B is somewhere such that BD is perpendicular to BC. For example, if B is on the extension of AD or something. 

Let me try placing B on AD extended. Let me say AD is vertical, DC is horizontal. Let me say D is at (0,0), C is at (x, 0), A is at (0, a). Now, let me place B somewhere on the line extending from AD. Let's say B is on AD extended below D. So B is at (0, -b), where b > 0. Then BD is from B(0,-b) to D(0,0), which is vertical. To have BD perpendicular to BC, BC must be horizontal. So BC is horizontal. Since B is at (0,-b), and BC is horizontal, point C must be at (c, -b). But C is already at (x, 0). So unless -b = 0, which would put B at D, which is not allowed. So this doesn't work.

Alternatively, place B somewhere else. Let me try to have BD perpendicular to BC. Let me choose B such that BD is some line, and BC is perpendicular to it.

Let me take B at (p, q). BD is from D(0,0) to B(p, q). BC is from B(p, q) to C(x, 0). These must be perpendicular. So (p, q) · (x - p, -q) = 0 → p(x - p) - q^2 = 0 → px - p² - q² = 0.

Also, angle ADB is 36°. DA is from D(0,0) to A(0, a), so DA is vertical. DB is from D(0,0) to B(p, q). The angle between DA (vertical) and DB is 36°. So the angle between vertical line DA and DB is 36°, which means that the slope of DB corresponds to tan(36°). 

Since DA is along positive y-axis, the angle between DA (positive y-axis) and DB (line to B) is 36°. So the slope of DB would be tan(90° - 36°) = tan(54°), because the angle between DA (vertical) and DB is measured from DA to DB. So if DA is upwards, and DB makes 36° with DA, then the slope of DB is tan(90° - 36°) = tan(54°).

Thus, the slope of DB is tan(54°). The slope of DB is q/p = tan(54°), so q = p tan(54°).

Now, from the perpendicularity condition: px - p² - q² = 0. Substitute q = p tan(54°):

px - p² - p² tan²(54°) = 0 → px = p²(1 + tan²(54°)) → x = p(1 + tan²(54°)).

But 1 + tan²θ = sec²θ, so x = p sec²(54°) → p = x cos²(54°).

Now, BD length is sqrt(p² + q²) = sqrt(p² + p² tan²(54°)) = p sqrt(1 + tan²(54°)) = p sec(54°) = x cos²(54°) * sec(54°) = x cos²(54°) / cos(54°) = x cos(54°).

But according to the problem, BD = 6x. So:

x cos(54°) = 6x → cos(54°) = 6 → which is impossible, as cos(54°) ≈ 0.5878.

Again, contradiction. This suggests that no matter how I arrange the points, the given conditions lead to a contradiction. This must mean that there's a different interpretation.

Wait, perhaps the angle ADB is not between DA and DB, but between AD and DB? Wait, Angle(A, D, B) is the angle at D between A-D-B, so it's between DA and DB, which is what I've been assuming. So that's correct.

Is there a possibility that the angle is measured in the other direction, like reflex angle? No, because it's specified as 36°, which is acute.

Wait, could there be a miscalculation in the trigonometric values? Let me calculate cos(54°). 54° is complementary to 36°, and cos(54°) = sin(36°) ≈ 0.5878. So yes, as before.

This suggests that the problem as stated has no solution under Euclidean geometry, which is unlikely. Hence, I must have misunderstood the configuration.

Let me try to think of it as two right triangles sharing a common side. For example, if ADC is right-angled at D, and ABD is some triangle with angle at D of 36°, and DBC is right-angled at B.

Wait, let me try to use trigonometry with triangle ABD. In triangle ABD, angle at D is 36°, side BD = 6x, and we need to relate it to other parts.

Let me denote DA = a, DB = 6x, AB = z.

Using the Law of Cosines in triangle ABD:

AB² = DA² + DB² - 2 * DA * DB * cos(36°)

So z² = a² + (6x)² - 2*a*6x*cos(36°)

Also, from triangle ADC, which is right-angled at D: DA² + DC² = AC² → a² + x² = y².

Now, what about triangle DBC? It is right-angled at B, so DC² = DB² + BC² → x² = (6x)² + BC² → BC² = x² - 36x² = -35x². Still impossible.

Unless BC is imaginary, which it cannot be. So this suggests that there's a mistake in the problem setup, or perhaps the given lengths are not directly related as I thought.

Wait, maybe the length DC is not x, but something else? Let me check the predicates again. The predicate says Equals(LengthOf(Line(D, C)), x). So DC is x.

Wait, perhaps the angle at D is 36°, and there's a way to relate this to the other right angles via some geometric property I'm missing. For example, using similar triangles or something.

Let me consider the possibility that triangles ABD and CBD are similar or something. But without knowing more angles or sides, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe the triangles are part of a larger figure, like a star or something.

Wait, let me think about the total angle at D. At point D, we have angle ADC = 90°, and angle ADB = 36°. Are these angles adjacent? If so, then the total angle at D would be 90° + 36° = 126°, but that depends on the arrangement.

If angle ADC is 90° and angle ADB is 36°, and both involve point D, then depending on where B is, these angles might overlap or be adjacent.

For example, if B is on the same side of DC as A, then angle ADC and angle ADB might add up. Or if B is on the other side, they might subtract.

Let me assume that at point D, the angle between DA and DC is 90°, and the angle between DA and DB is 36°, so the angle between DB and DC would be 90° - 36° = 54°. So angle BDC = 54°.

Now, in triangle DBC, which is right-angled at B, we have angle at B is 90°, angle at D is 54°, so angle at C is 180° - 90° - 54° = 36°. So triangle DBC has angles 90°, 54°, 36°.

In this case, the sides would be in proportion to the sine of their opposite angles.

So in triangle DBC:

- Opposite angle at B (90°): DC = x
- Opposite angle at D (54°): BC
- Opposite angle at C (36°): BD = 6x

Using the Law of Sines:

x / sin(90°) = BC / sin(54°) = 6x / sin(36°)

So from x / 1 = 6x / sin(36°) → x = 6x / sin(36°) → 1 = 6 / sin(36°) → sin(36°) = 6, which is still impossible.

This confirms the same contradiction. So this suggests that the given conditions are inconsistent, which is problematic.

But since this is a problem from a test, it must have a solution. Therefore, I must have made a wrong assumption about the configuration.

Wait, perhaps the angle at D in triangle DBC is not 54°? Let me re-examine. If at point D, the angle between DB and DC is 54°, then in triangle DBC, which is right-angled at B, the angles would be 90° at B, 54° at D, and 36° at C. But this leads to the same contradiction.

Alternatively, maybe the angle at D in triangle DBC is not 54°, but something else. Let me think: if angle between DB and DC is θ, then in triangle DBC, with right angle at B, we have:

tan(θ) = BC / BD.

But from earlier, BC² = x² - (6x)^2, which is negative. So this suggests that θ is imaginary, which is impossible.

This indicates that there's no real solution under the given conditions, which contradicts the problem's existence. Therefore, I must have misinterpreted the problem.

Let me revisit the original predicates and see if I misread anything.

Original predicates:

- RightAngle(Angle(A, D, C)) → angle at D between A, D, C is right angle.
- RightAngle(Angle(D, B, C)) → angle at B between D, B, C is right angle.
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A, D, B)), 36) → angle at D between A, D, B is 36°.
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(B, D)), 6x)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(D, C)), x)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(A, B)), z)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(A, C)), y)

Question: Find x.

Answer choices: A. 6, B. 3√6, C. 12, D. 6√6.

Wait, perhaps the length DC is not x, but something else? No, it is given as x. Or perhaps the angle is not 36°, but something else? No, it's 36°.

Wait, maybe the angle at D is 36°, and the right angles are part of a larger triangle where the sides can be expressed in terms of x using trigonometric identities.

Let me try to consider that in triangle DBC, even though the calculations suggest BC² = -35x², perhaps there's a different approach. Let me assume that x is such that this is possible, and see if it leads to a solution.

Let me set BC = i√35x, but this is imaginary, which is not acceptable. Hence, no.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different definition of angle or length, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the angle at D is 36°, and the right angle at B is part of a different triangle, and we need to use the Law of Sines in some way.

Let me consider triangle ABD, where angle at D is 36°, side BD = 6x, and side DA is some length a.

In triangle ABD, using Law of Sines:

AB / sin(angle at D) = BD / sin(angle at A) = DA / sin(angle at B)

But I don't know the other angles.

Alternatively, if I can find a relationship between DA and other sides.

But without more info, it's difficult.

Wait, from the right angle at D in ADC, DA² + x² = y². And from the right angle at B in DBC, BD² + BC² = x²
