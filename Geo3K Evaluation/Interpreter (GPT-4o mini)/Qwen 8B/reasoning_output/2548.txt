MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangle DEFG. First, I need to recall the properties of a rectangle. In a rectangle, all angles are right angles, so each angle measures 90 degrees. Also, opposite sides are equal and parallel, and the diagonals bisect each other. 

Now, the problem gives us two angle measures: m∠EDF = 5x - 3 and m∠DFG = 3x + 7. We need to find the measure of ∠EDF. Let me visualize the rectangle. Let me try to sketch it mentally. Let's label the rectangle D, E, F, G. Since it's a rectangle, the order of the letters should form a quadrilateral with four right angles. So, probably D connected to E and G, E connected to D and F, F connected to E and G, and G connected to F and D. Wait, but rectangles are usually labeled in order, so maybe D-E-F-G-D? That would make sense. So, points D, E, F, G arranged such that DE and FG are opposite sides, DF and EG are the other pair of opposite sides.

Now, the angles mentioned are ∠EDF and ∠DFG. Let me focus on those. Let me think about where these angles are located. 

First, ∠EDF: This is the angle at point D, formed by points E, D, F. So, vertex at D, with segments ED and FD. Since D is a corner of the rectangle, ED and DG would be adjacent sides. But wait, if the rectangle is D-E-F-G-D, then from D, the sides are DE and DG. Wait, but ∠EDF would involve ED and DF. Hmm, perhaps my initial assumption about the labeling is off. Maybe the rectangle is D-E-F-G with sides DE, EF, FG, GD. Then, the diagonals would be DF and EG. 

Wait, in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other. So, diagonal DF connects D to F. Therefore, ∠EDF is the angle at D between ED and DF. Similarly, ∠DFG is the angle at F between DF and FG. 

Let me try to imagine this. At point D, there's side DE going to E, and side DG going to G. The diagonal DF splits the rectangle into two triangles. So, ∠EDF is part of triangle DEF. Similarly, ∠DFG is part of triangle DGF. 

But since it's a rectangle, angle at D is 90 degrees. However, ∠EDF is not the entire 90-degree angle. Instead, it's one of the angles formed by the diagonal DF. So, in triangle DEF, which is a right triangle because the original figure is a rectangle. Wait, DF is a diagonal, so triangle D-E-F is a right triangle with right angle at E? No, because in rectangle DEFG, the right angles are at each corner. So, angle at E is 90 degrees. Wait, but if we consider triangle DEF, then point E is connected to D and F. Wait, maybe I need to clarify the structure again.

Alternatively, maybe I should use coordinates to model the rectangle. Let me assign coordinates to the rectangle. Let me place point D at the origin (0,0). Since it's a rectangle, suppose DE is along the x-axis and DG is along the y-axis. Let me define coordinates:

- D: (0, 0)
- E: (a, 0) for some a > 0
- F: (a, b) for some b > 0
- G: (0, b)

So, the rectangle has length a and width b. Now, the diagonal DF goes from D(0,0) to F(a,b). Then, ∠EDF is the angle at D between DE (which is along the x-axis from D to E) and DF (the diagonal from D to F). Similarly, ∠DFG is the angle at F between DF (from D to F) and FG (from F to G). 

So, first, let's find expressions for these angles. For ∠EDF, which is the angle between DE (along x-axis) and DF (diagonal). The slope of DF is (b - 0)/(a - 0) = b/a. Therefore, the angle θ between DE (x-axis) and DF can be found using tanθ = (opposite/adjacent) = b/a. Therefore, θ = arctan(b/a). 

Similarly, ∠DFG is the angle at F between DF and FG. Let's analyze that. Point F is at (a, b). FG goes from F(a,b) to G(0,b), which is left along the horizontal line y = b. So, vector FG is (-a, 0). Vector FD is from F(a,b) to D(0,0), which is (-a, -b). So, angle at F between FG and FD. To find this angle, we can compute the angle between vectors FG and FD. 

Vector FG is (-a, 0), and vector FD is (-a, -b). The angle between them can be found using the dot product formula:

cosφ = (FG • FD)/(|FG| |FD|)

Compute the dot product:

(-a)(-a) + (0)(-b) = a² + 0 = a²

|FG| = sqrt((-a)^2 + 0^2) = a

|FD| = sqrt((-a)^2 + (-b)^2) = sqrt(a² + b²)

Therefore,

cosφ = a² / (a * sqrt(a² + b²)) ) = a / sqrt(a² + b²)

Which means φ = arccos(a / sqrt(a² + b²)). Alternatively, note that in triangle DFG, which is a right triangle? Wait, no. Wait, point F is connected to D and G. From earlier, FG is horizontal, FD is diagonal. So, triangle DFG is not necessarily a right triangle. However, perhaps we can relate angles here.

But maybe there's another way. Since we know that in the rectangle, the sum of angles around point F... Wait, but maybe there's a relationship between ∠EDF and ∠DFG?

Alternatively, considering that the diagonal DF divides the rectangle into two congruent right triangles. So, triangle D-E-F and triangle D-G-F. Each of these triangles has legs of length a and b, hypotenuse sqrt(a² + b²). 

In triangle D-E-F, angle at D (∠EDF) is θ = arctan(b/a). In triangle D-G-F, angle at F (∠DFG) would be complementary to θ? Wait, let's see. Because in triangle D-E-F, the angles are:

At E: 90 degrees (since it's a rectangle).

At D: θ = arctan(b/a)

At F: 90° - θ

But wait, triangle D-E-F is a right triangle with right angle at E. Therefore, the sum of angles at D and F is 90 degrees. Therefore, ∠DFG is part of that triangle? Or is it part of another triangle?

Wait, ∠DFG is at point F, between DF and FG. Earlier, we considered the angle between FG (which is horizontal from F to G) and FD (diagonal from F to D). In triangle DFG, which isn't a right triangle, but perhaps we can relate it to other parts.

Alternatively, since the rectangle's angles are all 90 degrees, and the diagonals split the angles. Wait, in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other but do not necessarily bisect the angles unless it's a square. So, unless it's a square, the diagonals don't split the 90-degree angles into two equal parts. Therefore, ∠EDF and ∠DFG are not necessarily equal, but they are related through the properties of the rectangle.

But how can we relate these two angles given? Let's think about the fact that the sum of certain angles might be 90 degrees or something else.

Alternatively, maybe we can use coordinate geometry to express the angles. Let's take specific coordinates for simplicity. Suppose the rectangle has sides of length a and b. Then, as before, the coordinates are D(0,0), E(a,0), F(a,b), G(0,b). 

Then, vector DE is (a, 0), vector DF is (a, b). The angle between DE and DF is ∠EDF. Using the tangent of that angle, which is (opposite over adjacent) in the right triangle formed by dropping a perpendicular from F to DE. Wait, but actually, the angle between DE and DF can be found via the slope, as I thought before.

tan(∠EDF) = (height)/(base) = b/a. Therefore, ∠EDF = arctan(b/a).

Similarly, looking at ∠DFG. At point F(a,b), the segment FG goes to G(0,b), which is left along the horizontal line. The segment FD goes from F(a,b) to D(0,0). So, the angle between FG (leftward) and FD (diagonal down-left). To find this angle, perhaps we can consider the slope of FD. The slope of FD is (0 - b)/(0 - a) = b/a. Wait, but direction matters. The line FD goes from F(a,b) to D(0,0), so its slope is (change in y)/(change in x) = (0 - b)/(0 - a) = b/a. So, the angle that FD makes with the horizontal axis (at point F) would be measured from FG (which is along negative x-axis) to FD. 

Wait, at point F, FG is pointing towards the left (negative x-direction), and FD is pointing towards the southwest direction. The angle between FG (left) and FD (southwest) can be determined by considering the slope of FD relative to the horizontal. 

Since the slope of FD is b/a, which implies that the angle between FD and the horizontal axis (x-axis) is arctan(b/a). But since FD is going from F to D, which is downward and to the left, the angle between FD and the positive x-axis is 180° - arctan(b/a). However, at point F, the direction of FG is along the negative x-axis (to the left). So, the angle between FG (negative x-axis) and FD is the difference between 180° - arctan(b/a) and 180°, which is just arctan(b/a). Wait, that seems conflicting. Maybe another approach.

Imagine standing at point F(a,b). The direction of FG is directly to the left (towards G(0,b)), so that's along the negative x-axis. The direction of FD is towards D(0,0), which is southwest. The angle between FG (left) and FD (southwest) is the same as the angle between the negative x-axis and the line FD. Since FD has a slope of b/a (rise over run from F to D: change in y is -b, change in x is -a, so slope is (-b)/(-a)=b/a). So, the angle that FD makes with the positive x-axis is arctan(b/a) measured clockwise from the positive x-axis. But since we're measuring from the negative x-axis (direction of FG), the angle between FG and FD would be 90° minus arctan(b/a)? Wait, no. Let me think carefully.

Suppose we have a line FD making an angle θ with the positive x-axis, where tanθ = b/a. But since FD is going from F to D, which is down and left, θ is measured from the positive x-axis to FD, going counterclockwise. However, since it's going down and left, θ is in the third quadrant. But when calculating angles between directions, we often consider the smallest angle between two lines.

Alternatively, the angle between FG (negative x-axis) and FD can be found by taking the angle between the negative x-axis and FD. Since FD has a slope of b/a, which corresponds to an angle α above the negative x-axis, where tanα = b/a. Therefore, ∠DFG = α = arctan(b/a). Wait, that would mean ∠DFG equals ∠EDF? But that can't be right unless the rectangle is a square.

Wait, but according to this, both angles would be equal. However, in reality, in a rectangle that's not a square, the angles ∠EDF and ∠DFG would be different. There's a contradiction here. Where did I go wrong?

Let me re-examine. Let's take specific numbers. Suppose the rectangle is a square with a = b. Then, the slope of FD is 1, so arctan(1) = 45°. Thus, ∠EDF would be 45°, and ∠DFG would also be 45°, which makes sense because in a square, the diagonals bisect the angles. So, that checks out.

But if the rectangle is not a square, say a ≠ b. Let me take a=3, b=4. Then, the slope of FD is 4/3, so arctan(4/3) ≈ 53.13°. But ∠EDF is the angle between DE (positive x-axis) and FD, which would be 53.13°, while ∠DFG is the angle between FG (negative x-axis) and FD. If FD makes 53.13° with the positive x-axis, then the angle between negative x-axis and FD is 180° - 53.13° = 126.87°, which doesn't seem to match. Wait, but that contradicts the previous conclusion. So there's a mistake here.

Ah! My error was in assuming that the angle between FG (negative x-axis) and FD is α, but actually, the angle depends on the actual direction. Let me redo the calculation.

For the case of a=3, b=4. The slope of FD is rise/run = (0 - 4)/(0 - 3) = 4/3. So, the angle that FD makes with the positive x-axis is arctan(4/3) ≈ 53.13°, but since it's going to the left and down, the actual angle from the positive x-axis is 180° - 53.13° = 126.87°. However, the angle between FG (which is along negative x-axis, i.e., 180°) and FD (which is at 126.87°) is the difference between 180° and 126.87°, which is 53.13°, which is the same as ∠EDF. Wait, so in this case, ∠DFG is also 53.13°, which is the same as ∠EDF. But that can't be right. How come?

Wait, if in a rectangle with a=3, b=4, the angles ∠EDF and ∠DFG are both arctan(4/3), implying they are equal? But in reality, in a non-square rectangle, shouldn't these angles be different? Let me check with coordinates.

Take point D(0,0), E(3,0), F(3,4), G(0,4). So, DF is from (0,0) to (3,4). The angle ∠EDF is between DE (from D(0,0) to E(3,0)) and DF (from D(0,0) to F(3,4)). The angle between these two vectors is indeed arctan(4/3) ≈ 53.13°.

Now, ∠DFG is at point F(3,4), between DF (from F to D(0,0)) and FG (from F(3,4) to G(0,4)). The vector FG is (-3, 0), and vector FD is (-3, -4). So, the angle between FG (-3,0) and FD (-3,-4). To find this angle, we can use the dot product:

cosθ = ( (-3)(-3) + (0)(-4) ) / (|FG| * |FD| )

= (9 + 0) / (3 * 5) = 9 / 15 = 3/5.

Thus, θ = arccos(3/5) ≈ 53.13°, which is the same as before. So, even though the rectangle is not a square, ∠DFG is equal to ∠EDF. Wait, so in general, in any rectangle, ∠EDF equals ∠DFG? That seems surprising, but according to this example, yes. Therefore, the two angles are equal.

But why? Is there a geometric reason for that?

Yes! Because in the rectangle, the diagonals are congruent and the triangles formed by the diagonals are congruent. Specifically, triangles D-E-F and D-G-F are congruent. Therefore, corresponding angles are equal. Hence, ∠EDF in triangle D-E-F is equal to ∠DFG in triangle D-G-F. Therefore, m∠EDF = m∠DFG.

Wait, but in our example with a=3, b=4, both angles were approximately 53.13°, which matched. Therefore, the two angles are equal. Therefore, setting 5x - 3 = 3x + 7. Solving for x:

5x - 3 = 3x + 7  
Subtract 3x from both sides: 2x - 3 = 7  
Add 3 to both sides: 2x = 10  
Divide by 2: x = 5  

Then, substituting back into either expression:  
m∠EDF = 5(5) - 3 = 25 - 3 = 22.  
Or, m∠DFG = 3(5) + 7 = 15 + 7 = 22. Both give 22. So, the measure of ∠EDF is 22 degrees. Looking at the answer choices, option A is 22. So, the correct answer would be A.

But wait, let me confirm once more. Are the two angles really always equal in a rectangle? Let's think of another example. Suppose a rectangle with a=1, b=1 (square). Then, ∠EDF would be 45°, and ∠DFG would also be 45°, which matches. Another example: a=1, b=√3. Then, tan(angle) = √3/1 → 60°, so both angles would be 60°, which makes sense. Therefore, in any rectangle, these two angles are equal. Therefore, the equations given in the problem allow us to set 5x - 3 = 3x + 7, leading to x=5, hence m∠EDF=22°, which is option A.

But wait, the answer options include A.22, so that's the answer. So the correct answer is A.
