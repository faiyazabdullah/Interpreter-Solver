Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have some given predicates and need to find the value of x, which is the length of line AC. Let me start by breaking down the given information.

First, the problem states that there's a right angle at Angle(A,C,B). Wait, so point C is the vertex of the right angle? That means angle ACB is a right angle. So triangle ABC has a right angle at C. Then it says MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)) is 30 degrees. Let me parse that. The angle at point B, between points A, B, and C. So angle ABC is 30 degrees. 

So, summarizing the given info:
- Triangle ABC is right-angled at C.
- Angle at B (angle ABC) is 30 degrees.
- Length of CB is 10√3.
- Need to find length AC, which is denoted as x.

Let me visualize this triangle. Since it's right-angled at C, sides AC and BC are the legs, and AB is the hypotenuse. Given that angle at B is 30 degrees, so in triangle ABC, angle B = 30°, angle C = 90°, so angle at A must be 60°, since angles add up to 180°. 

In a right-angled triangle with angles 30°, 60°, 90°, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. Specifically, the side opposite 30° is half the hypotenuse. Wait, here angle B is 30°, so the side opposite to angle B would be AC. Because in triangle ABC, angle B is at point B, so the opposite side is AC. Wait, let me confirm:

In triangle ABC, angle at B is 30°, so the side opposite to angle B is AC. The side adjacent to angle B is BC, which is given as 10√3. And the hypotenuse is AB. 

Wait, but since angle C is the right angle, the hypotenuse is AB. Therefore, using trigonometry, tan(angle B) equals opposite over adjacent. So tan(30°) = AC / BC. 

Alternatively, since we know angle B is 30°, and BC is adjacent to angle B, and AC is opposite. So tan(30°) = AC / BC. 

We know BC is 10√3, so plugging in:

tan(30°) = AC / (10√3)

But tan(30°) is 1/√3. Therefore,

1/√3 = AC / (10√3)

Multiply both sides by 10√3:

AC = (1/√3) * 10√3 = 10. 

Wait, that simplifies to 10. So x is 10. But let me check if I got the ratios right. Alternatively, maybe using sine or cosine?

Since angle B is 30°, in triangle ABC, sin(30°) = opposite / hypotenuse = AC / AB. But maybe another way. Also, cos(30°) = adjacent / hypotenuse = BC / AB. 

But perhaps using the standard 30-60-90 triangle ratios. In such triangles, the sides are 1 (opposite 30°), √3 (opposite 60°), and 2 (hypotenuse). Here, angle B is 30°, so the side opposite angle B (which is AC) should be the shortest side, which is 1 unit in the standard ratio. The side adjacent to angle B (BC) would be √3 units. Therefore, if BC is 10√3, then scaling factor is (10√3)/√3 = 10. Hence, AC, being the side opposite 30°, would be 1 * 10 = 10. So yes, x=10. 

Looking at the answer choices, option A is 10. So the answer should be A. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the sides. Another way: since angle C is 90°, angle B is 30°, angle A is 60°. So side BC is opposite angle A (60°), and AC is opposite angle B (30°). Wait, wait, no. Wait, in triangle ABC, each angle is opposite the corresponding side. So:

- Side opposite angle A is BC.
- Side opposite angle B is AC.
- Side opposite angle C is AB.

Therefore, angle B is 30°, so AC is opposite to it. So AC corresponds to the side opposite 30°, which in the standard ratio is the shorter leg. BC is adjacent to angle B, which is the longer leg. So BC is longer than AC. Given BC is 10√3, which matches the longer leg (√3 times the shorter leg). Therefore, if BC = longer leg = √3 * shorter leg, then shorter leg (AC) = BC / √3 = (10√3)/√3 = 10. Yep, same result. 

Thus, x is 10, so answer A.
