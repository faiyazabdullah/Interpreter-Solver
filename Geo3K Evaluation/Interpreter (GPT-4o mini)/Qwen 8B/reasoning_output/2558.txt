MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a triangle QRS, and it's given that it's an equilateral triangle. Wait, but the problem says to find RS, which would be one of the sides. But since it's equilateral, all sides should be equal. However, there are some expressions given for the lengths of the sides in terms of x. Let me parse the given predicates again.

First, Triangle(Q,R,S) means we have a triangle with vertices Q, R, and S. Then, Equals(LengthOf(Line(Q,R)), 4x). So QR is 4x. Next, Equals(LengthOf(Line(R,S)), 2x + 1), so RS is 2x + 1. Lastly, Equals(LengthOf(Line(Q,S)), 6x - 1), so QS is 6x - 1. 

But wait, the question states that triangle QRS is equilateral. In an equilateral triangle, all three sides are equal. Therefore, QR = RS = QS. So I need to set up equations where each side equals the others.

So, QR is 4x, RS is 2x + 1, and QS is 6x - 1. Since they're all equal, I can set them equal to each other. Let me write that down.

First, set QR equal to RS: 4x = 2x + 1. Solving this equation gives 4x - 2x = 1 → 2x = 1 → x = 1/2. But then I should check if this value of x also satisfies the equality between RS and QS, or QR and QS.

Let me compute RS when x=1/2: 2*(1/2) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2. Then QS would be 6*(1/2) - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2. Oh, so RS and QS both equal 2. And QR was 4*(1/2)=2. So all sides are equal to 2. That works! So x is 1/2. But the question asks for RS. Since RS is 2x + 1, substituting x=1/2 gives RS = 2*(1/2)+1 = 1 +1=2. So RS is 2. Looking at the answer choices, D is 2. So the answer should be D. 

Wait, but let me make sure there isn't another way this could be approached. For example, maybe I made a mistake in assuming all sides are equal? Because the problem says the triangle is equilateral, so yes, all sides must be equal. Therefore, setting all pairs equal is correct. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a case where two sides are equal, but that's not the case here because the problem explicitly states it's equilateral. So my initial approach is correct. Hence, RS equals 2, which is answer D.
