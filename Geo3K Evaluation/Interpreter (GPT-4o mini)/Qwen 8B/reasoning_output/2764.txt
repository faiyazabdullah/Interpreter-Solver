====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, we need to find the value of y based on the given predicates. Let me start by going through each part step by step.

First, let me list out all the given information. There are several points mentioned: H, D, A, Y, E, B, I, G. Then there are lines connecting them: Line(D,A), Line(E,I), Line(H,G). Angles are given at various points: Angle(D,Y,A), Angle(E,B,I), Angle(H,Y,B), Angle(Y,B,G). Also, some equality conditions involving measures of these angles. Plus, there's a statement that Line(D,A) is parallel to Line(E,I).

The variables involved are x and y. The question asks for the value of y. The answer choices are A. 30, B. 50, C. 60, D. 80.

Let me parse each predicate carefully. 

Starting with the lines. Line(D,A) means points D and A form a straight line. Similarly for others. Now, the angles: Angle(D,Y,A) – so vertex at Y, with sides DY and YA. Similarly, Angle(E,B,I) has vertex at B, with sides BE and BI. Angle(H,Y,B) has vertex at Y, sides HY and YB. And Angle(Y,B,G) has vertex at B, sides YB and BG.

Also, the measure of Angle(D,Y,A) equals 3x - 15. The measure of Angle(A,Y,B) equals y + 25. Wait, but where is Angle(A,Y,B)? That would be vertex at Y, with sides YA and YB. Wait, but earlier there was Angle(H,Y,B), which is vertex at Y with sides HY and YB. So maybe those two angles at Y are adjacent? Maybe forming a linear pair or something?

Then, the measure of Angle(E,B,I) is given as... wait, the third predicate says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(E,B,G)),105). Wait, original list says:

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,Y,A)),3*x-15)

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,Y,B)),y+25)

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(E,B,G)),105)

Wait, so Angle(E,B,G) is at point B, with sides BE and BG. But also, there's Angle(E,B,I) which is at point B, with sides BE and BI. Hmm. Also, since Line(E,I) is given, so points E and I are connected by a line. Also, Line(D,A) is parallel to Line(E,I). 

So, perhaps there are some transversal lines here. Since DA || EI, and if there are other lines intersecting them, creating corresponding angles or alternate interior angles. 

But first, let me note down all equations:

Angle(DYA) = 3x -15 degrees.

Angle(AYB) = y +25 degrees.

Angle(EBG) = 105 degrees.

Also, there's Angle(E,B,I) which is another angle at B. Wait, but the user wrote Angle(E,B,I) as one of the given angles. Wait, looking back:

Original list:

- Angle(E,B,I)

- Angle(H,Y,B)

- Angle(Y,B,G)

Wait, the measure of Angle(E,B,G) is 105. So Angle(E,B,G) is different from Angle(E,B,I). 

Now, trying to visualize the diagram. Since there are multiple points and lines, it's a bit complex. Let me try to sketch mentally.

We have points D, A connected by a line. Points E and I connected by another line. These two lines are parallel (DA || EI). 

There's a point Y, with angles DYA and AYB. So Y is somewhere such that lines DY and YA form angle DYA, and lines YA and YB form angle AYB. So Y is connected to A, and possibly to other points like B, H, G, etc. 

Also, there's a point H connected to G via a line HG. Also, angles at Y: H-Y-B and Y-B-G. Wait, Angle(H,Y,B) is at Y, between H and B. So H-Y-B. And Angle(Y,B,G) is at B between Y and G. 

So maybe there's a triangle or some polygon involving points Y, B, G, H, and others. 

Since DA is parallel to EI, maybe there's a transversal cutting through them, creating corresponding angles. For example, if there's a line crossing DA and EI, then certain angles could be equal. 

Looking at the angles given. Let me think about the angles around point Y. We have Angle(DYA) and Angle(AYB). Those two angles share side YA. So they are adjacent, forming a larger angle at Y. Unless there's another angle involved. 

Wait, if we consider the sum of angles around point Y. Suppose that Angle(DYA) and Angle(AYB) are adjacent, then their sum would be the total angle at Y. However, unless there's more information, like if lines HY and something else make up the rest. 

Alternatively, considering that there's an angle at Y called H-Y-B, which is Angle(H,Y,B). So that would mean that HY and YB form an angle at Y. So if we have Angle(DYA) and Angle(H,Y,B) both at Y, then maybe they are supplementary or something? 

Alternatively, maybe points D, Y, A, H, B, G are arranged in such a way that multiple lines meet at Y. 

This seems complicated without a diagram. Let me try to focus on the given equations and see if I can relate them.

We know that DA is parallel to EI. So if there is a transversal intersecting these lines, say line YB or something else, then corresponding angles would be equal. 

For instance, suppose line YB intersects DA and EI. Since DA || EI, then the corresponding angles would be equal. Let me check if that applies here.

Let me think about the angles at point B. We have Angle(E,B,I) and Angle(E,B,G). Wait, Angle(E,B,I) is at B between E and I, and Angle(E,B,G) is at B between E and G. So points E, B, I and E, B, G. So maybe line BG is connected to point G, and line BI is connected to point I. 

Additionally, there's a line HG. So points H and G are connected. 

Perhaps there's a triangle involving points B, G, and I? Or maybe some relationship between angles at B.

Another thought: since DA || EI, and if there's a line that cuts through both, creating corresponding angles. For example, if line YB crosses DA and EI, then the angle formed at Y on DA would correspond to the angle formed at B on EI. But I'm not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe triangle YBA is involved. Since we have angles at Y and B. 

Let me look again at the angles given:

Angle(D,Y,A) = 3x -15. This is angle at Y between D and A.

Angle(A,Y,B) = y +25. This is angle at Y between A and B.

So together, these two angles at Y add up to angle between D and B via Y. So angle D-Y-B is (3x -15) + (y +25) = 3x + y +10 degrees. Wait, but if there's another angle at Y, which is Angle(H,Y,B), which is angle between H and B. So if points D, Y, A, H, B are connected in some way, maybe those angles around Y sum up to a straight line or something. 

Alternatively, if points D, Y, A, H are colinear? Not necessarily. 

Wait, but let's think about the angles at Y. Suppose that the lines HY and BY form angle H-Y-B. Then if we have angle D-Y-A and angle A-Y-B, which are adjacent, adding up to angle D-Y-B. Therefore, if angle D-Y-B is composed of angle D-Y-A plus angle A-Y-B, then angle D-Y-B = (3x -15) + (y +25) = 3x + y +10. But also, angle H-Y-B is given as another angle at Y. So perhaps angle H-Y-B is adjacent to angle D-Y-B? Or maybe they are vertical angles? 

Alternatively, maybe angle D-Y-B and angle H-Y-B are supplementary because they form a linear pair? For example, if lines DH and HB are straight, making angles at Y. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's tricky. 

Alternatively, since DA || EI, and if there's a transversal line passing through Y and B, creating corresponding angles. For example, if line YB is a transversal, then angle between DA and YB would correspond to angle between EI and YB. 

Wait, let's consider that. If DA || EI, and line YB is a transversal, then the corresponding angles would be equal. For instance, angle between DA and YB at point Y (which is angle D-Y-A?) Wait, angle D-Y-A is at Y, between D and A. So that would be the angle between line YD and YA. But if YB is the transversal, then maybe that angle corresponds to another angle at point B. 

Wait, maybe angle at B between E and I (Angle(E,B,I)) corresponds to angle at Y between D and A (angle D-Y-A). Because DA || EI, and YB is the transversal. Therefore, angle D-Y-A would equal angle E-B-I. 

Is that possible? Let me think. If two lines are parallel, and a transversal cuts them, then corresponding angles are equal. So if DA || EI, and line YB is a transversal, then angle between DA and YB at Y (which is angle D-Y-A) would equal the angle between EI and YB at B (which is angle E-B-I). 

Therefore, angle D-Y-A equals angle E-B-I. Given that angle D-Y-A is 3x -15, and angle E-B-I is given as... Wait, the given measure of Angle(E,B,G) is 105. Wait, but angle E-B-I isn't directly given. Wait, let me check the original predicates again.

Original given angles:

- Angle(E,B,I): this is angle at B between E and I. So that's angle EBI.

- Angle(E,B,G): angle at B between E and G, which is given as 105 degrees.

So if angle EBI (Angle(E,B,I)) is equal to angle D-Y-A (from the parallel lines), then:

Measure of angle D-Y-A = Measure of angle E-B-I.

Thus,

3x -15 = measure of angle EBI.

But we don't know measure of angle EBI yet. However, maybe we can find it using other information.

At point B, we have angles involving E, B, I and E, B, G. So angle EBI (at B between E and I) and angle EBG (at B between E and G). Are these angles adjacent? If points I, B, G are colinear, then angle EBI + angle EBG would be a straight line. Wait, but that depends on how the points are arranged.

Assuming that line EI is parallel to DA, and line BG connects to point G. Also, there's a line HG. Perhaps points I, B, G are connected in some way. 

Alternatively, since angle EBG is 105 degrees, and if angle EBI is adjacent to it, then their sum could be 180 degrees if they are supplementary. But we need to confirm if they are adjacent.

Suppose that at point B, lines BE, BG, and BI are present. So if points I, B, G are colinear, then angle EBI and angle EBG would be adjacent, forming a straight line. Thus, angle EBI + angle EBG = 180 degrees. 

But if that's the case, then:

measure(angle EBI) + measure(angle EBG) = 180°

Given that measure(angle EBG) is 105°, then measure(angle EBI) = 180° - 105° = 75°.

Therefore, angle EBI = 75°, which would equal angle D-Y-A (since they're corresponding angles due to DA || EI). Hence:

3x -15 = 75 → 3x = 90 → x = 30.

Once we know x, we can use that in other parts. 

But how does this relate to finding y?

We also have angle AYB (Angle(A,Y,B)) which is given as y +25. Earlier, we had considered that angle D-Y-A (which is 3x -15) and angle AYB (y +25) are adjacent, forming angle D-Y-B. But if there's another angle at Y, angle H-Y-B, which is given as part of the predicates. Wait, the Angle(H,Y,B) is another angle at Y. 

Let me re-examine the given angles. There's:

- Angle(H,Y,B): at Y between H and B.

And Angle(Y,B,G): at B between Y and G.

So, maybe there's a triangle or quadrilateral involving points Y, B, G, H. 

Alternatively, considering that angle H-Y-B and angle A-Y-B are adjacent? If points H, Y, A are connected in some way. 

Alternatively, if we consider that angle at Y between H and B (H-Y-B) and angle at Y between D and A (D-Y-A) and angle at Y between A and B (A-Y-B) are related. 

But without a clear diagram, this is challenging. However, let's assume that angles at Y: D-Y-A, A-Y-B, and H-Y-B are connected in some way. 

Alternatively, if points D, Y, A, H are collinear? No, because angle D-Y-A suggests that lines DY and YA form an angle, implying that Y is not on the line DA. 

Wait, if DA is a line, and Y is a point not on DA, then angle D-Y-A is formed. Similarly, if there's another line HY connected to Y, forming angle H-Y-B. 

Maybe we need to consider triangle YHB or something. 

Alternatively, focusing on the angles at Y. Suppose that angle D-Y-A and angle A-Y-B are adjacent, forming angle D-Y-B. Then angle D-Y-B is equal to (3x -15) + (y +25) = 3x + y +10. 

If there's another angle at Y, like angle H-Y-B, which is given. If these angles are supplementary, meaning they form a straight line. For example, if H-Y-B and D-Y-B are supplementary, then:

angle H-Y-B + angle D-Y-B = 180°

But we need to know what angle H-Y-B is. However, it's not directly given. Wait, but maybe angle H-Y-B relates to other angles. 

Alternatively, since there's a line HG, and angle H-Y-B is part of that. Maybe line HG passes through Y? Or is connected to other points. 

Alternatively, if we consider triangle YHG or something. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involving points Y, B, and G. Since angle Y-B-G is given as part of the predicates. 

Wait, angle Y-B-G is at B between Y and G. Which we already used earlier in determining angle EBI. 

Wait, earlier assumption was that angle EBI and EBG are supplementary, leading to angle EBI being 75°, hence x=30. Once x is found, can we find relations involving y?

Yes. Because angle AYB is y +25. Also, angle AYB is part of the angles at Y. If we can express angle AYB in terms of other angles or find its relation to known quantities.

Alternatively, maybe triangle AYB is involved. In triangle AYB, the sum of angles should be 180°. But we need to know other angles in that triangle. 

Alternatively, if we consider that angle D-Y-A (which is 3x -15) and angle A-Y-B (y +25) are two angles at Y, and maybe there's another angle at Y related to point H. 

But without more info, perhaps we need to consider the entire setup again. 

Earlier, we found x=30. Let's plug that in. So 3x -15 becomes 3*30 -15 = 90 -15 = 75°, which matched our previous calculation for angle EBI. 

Now, what about angle AYB (which is y +25). How can we relate this to other angles? 

Let me think about the angles around point Y. Suppose that angle D-Y-A (75°), angle A-Y-B (y+25), and angle H-Y-B are all angles at Y. Depending on the configuration, they may sum up to a full rotation or some other value. 

Alternatively, if points D, Y, H are colinear, then angle D-Y-H would be a straight line, but that's speculative. 

Alternatively, if lines HY and DA are related. Since DA || EI, and if HY is a transversal? Not sure. 

Wait, another idea: since DA || EI, and if there is a line connecting Y to B, then as before, angle D-Y-A corresponds to angle E-B-I. Which gave us angle EBI = 75°, leading to x=30. 

Now, looking at angle AYB (y +25). If we can find this angle through other means. 

Let me consider triangle YAB. In triangle YAB, the angles at Y, A, and B. Wait, but we don't know much about triangle YAB. Alternatively, if there's a relationship between angles at B. 

We know that at point B, angle EBG is 105°, and angle EBI is 75°, as previously determined. Assuming that points I, B, G are colinear, then angles EBI and EBG are adjacent, summing to 180°, as before. 

But what about other angles at B? For instance, angle Y-B-G is given as part of the predicates. Wait, the angle Y-B-G is at B between Y and G. So that is angle YBG. 

So, angle YBG is 105°, as per the given measure of Angle(E,B,G) is 105°. Wait, no. Wait, the third predicate says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(E,B,G)),105). So Angle(E,B,G) is at B, between E and G. So that's angle EBG. So measure of angle EBG is 105°, which we've already used. 

But angle YBG is the same as angle EBG? Wait, no. Wait, angle YBG is at B between Y and G. Whereas angle EBG is at B between E and G. So unless Y, E, and something else are aligned. 

Wait, if line YB is the same as line EB? No, unless points Y and E coincide, which they probably aren't. 

Alternatively, if line YB is connected to point E somehow. 

This is getting too vague. Let me think differently. 

We have angle AYB = y +25. If we can express this angle in terms of other known angles. 

Suppose that angle AYB is part of a triangle or a straight line. For example, if points A, Y, B are connected, and there's a line from Y to another point, creating some known angles. 

Alternatively, if there's a straight line through Y and B, then angle AYB could be related to other angles. 

Wait, maybe we can consider that angle AYB and angle H-Y-B are supplementary. If lines HY and AB are straight. 

Alternatively, if points H, Y, B are colinear, then angle H-Y-B would be a straight angle, but that's unlikely. 

Wait, but there's an angle H-Y-B given as a predicate. So angle at Y between H and B. If I can relate that to other angles. 

Alternatively, considering that line HG is given. If line HG passes through Y, then angle H-Y-B would be part of some triangle. 

Alternatively, think about triangle YHB. In that triangle, angle at Y is H-Y-B, and other angles would depend on other points. 

But without more information, this is difficult. 

Wait, maybe we can use the fact that angle D-Y-A = 75°, and angle AYB = y +25, and if they are part of a triangle or straight line. 

Wait, if lines DY and YA form angle D-Y-A (75°), and line YA is connected to point B, forming angle AYB (y+25). If there's a line from Y to B, then the total angle at Y between D and B would be angle D-Y-A + angle A-Y-B = 75 + y +25 = y + 100 degrees. 

If that angle D-Y-B is part of another angle, like angle H-Y-B. For example, if points D, Y, H are colinear, then angle D-Y-B and angle H-Y-B would be supplementary. 

Assume that points D, Y, H are colinear. Then angle D-Y-B + angle H-Y-B = 180°. 

So angle D-Y-B = 75 + y +25 = y +100. 

If angle H-Y-B is another angle, say, related to other parts. 

But we don't have information about angle H-Y-B directly. However, maybe there's a way to find it. 

Wait, there's another angle at Y: Angle(H,Y,B). Is there a way to relate that to other angles? 

Alternatively, if line HY is parallel to something? Or if there's a triangle involving H, Y, B. 

Alternatively, if we consider triangle HYG or something. 

Alternatively, since there's a line HG, and angle at Y is H-Y-B, maybe line HG forms some relationship with other lines. 

This is really challenging without seeing the diagram. Let me think of another approach. 

We have two equations:

From angle EBI = 75°, leading to x=30.

We need to find y. 

What else do we know? 

We have angle AYB = y +25. Maybe this angle is related to angle EBG = 105°, or other angles. 

If we consider triangle YBG. At point B, angle YBG is part of the angle EBG. Wait, angle EBG is 105°, which includes angle YBG? Or is it separate?

If line YB is connected to point B, then at point B, we have angle EBG (between E and G) and angle YBG (between Y and G). So if points E, Y, and something are aligned, then maybe angle EBG = angle YBG + something. 

Alternatively, if line YE is connected, but I don't know. 

Alternatively, since DA || EI, and if line YB is a transversal, then angle between DA and YB at Y is equal to angle between EI and YB at B. Which we already used for angle EBI. 

But what about angle at Y between other lines? 

Wait, angle AYB (y +25) is at Y between A and B. If line YB is the same as the transversal, then angle between DA and YB at Y is 75°, and angle between YA and YB is y +25. So, if those two angles are adjacent, then angle between DA and YB at Y is 75°, and angle between YA and YB is y +25, then the total angle between DA and YB would be 75 + (y +25) = y +100. But that doesn't seem helpful unless we know more about the configuration. 

Alternatively, if line YB is such that it creates a straight line with DA or something else. 

Wait, here's an idea. If we consider the entire setup, maybe there's a triangle where angle AYB is part of, and we can use the sum of angles in a triangle. 

For example, if we consider triangle YAB, the sum of angles should be 180°. But we need to know the other angles in that triangle. 

In triangle YAB, angles are at Y (which is y +25), at A, and at B. 

But we don't know the other angles. However, if we can relate them to other parts. 

Alternatively, if there's a right angle or some known angle. 

Wait, but we don't have any right angles mentioned. 

Another thought: since DA || EI, and assuming that line YB is a transversal, then angle between DA and YB at Y (which is angle D-Y-A = 75°) is equal to angle between EI and YB at B (which is angle E-B-I = 75°). 

Now, if we consider line YB and line EI, and maybe line BG. 

At point B, we have angle E-B-I = 75°, angle E-B-G = 105°, and angle Y-B-G is part of that. 

Wait, angle E-B-G is 105°, and angle Y-B-G is part of that. If line YB is inside the angle E-B-G, then angle E-B-Y + angle Y-B-G = angle E-B-G. 

So, angle EBY + angle YBG = 105°. 

But angle EBY is the same as angle E-B-I? No, angle EBY is different from angle EBI. Wait, angle EBI is at B between E and I. If line YB is a different line from BI, then angle EBY is a different angle. 

Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Let me recap:

We have:

1. From DA || EI and transversal YB, angle D-Y-A = angle E-B-I => 3x -15 = measure of angle EBI. 

2. At point B, angle E-B-G = 105°, which is angle EBG. If we assume that angle EBI and angle EBG are adjacent, then angle EBI + angle EBG = 180°, giving angle EBI = 75°, hence x = 30. 

With x=30, we can proceed to find y. 

Now, what about angle AYB (y +25)? 

Maybe angle AYB is supplementary to angle EBI or something. 

Wait, if we consider line YB and line YA, and line YB forms some angles. 

Alternatively, if we consider triangle YAB, and if there's a relationship between angles at A and B. 

But without more info, it's hard. 

Wait, maybe angle AYB is related to angle YBG (which is 105°). 

If we consider that angle YBG is 105°, and angle AYB is y +25, and if they are adjacent or supplementary. 

For example, if line AB is straight, then angle AYB + angle YBG = 180°. But I don't know if AB is straight. 

Alternatively, if points A, Y, B are such that angle AYB and angle YBG form a straight line. 

Alternatively, if line AB is extended, and angle AYB is part of that. 

Alternatively, think about triangle YBG. In triangle YBG, we know angle at B is 105°, and if we can find other angles. 

But without knowing more about the triangle, it's hard. 

Wait, but we have angle AYB = y +25. If we can relate it to angle YBG. 

If line YB is connected to point G, forming angle YBG = 105°, and if there's a triangle involving Y, B, and another point. 

Alternatively, if there's a straight line through Y and G, making angle AYB and angle YBG supplementary. 

If angle AYB + angle YBG = 180°, then:

y +25 + 105 = 180 → y + 130 = 180 → y = 50. 

Which is option B. 

But why would angle AYB and angle YBG be supplementary? That would require that lines YA and BG are on a straight line, which may not be the case. But given the lack of other information, this seems plausible. 

Alternatively, if angle AYB and angle YBG are vertically opposite or something. 

Alternatively, if there's a transversal creating supplementary angles. 

But without the diagram, this is a stretch. However, given that this leads to y=50, which is one of the options, and given that x=30 is already determined, this might be the intended path. 

Let me verify:

If angle AYB + angle YBG = 180°, then:

(y +25) + 105 = 180 → y = 50. 

That gives y=50, which is option B. 

But why would those angles be supplementary? It depends on the diagram. If line YA is extended past A to meet with BG, but without confirmation, this is an assumption. 

However, given the available information and the need to find a value among the choices, this seems like a plausible approach. 

Alternatively, maybe angle AYB is equal to angle YBG. But that would give y +25 = 105 → y=80, which is option D. But that's less likely. 

Or maybe angle AYB is part of a triangle with other angles. 

Wait, if we consider triangle YAB and triangle YBG. 

But again, without more data, it's hard. 

Given that, and considering that angle AYB + angle YBG = 180° is a common scenario in geometry problems, especially with parallel lines and transversals, this might be the intended path. 

Thus, with that assumption, y=50, which is option B.
