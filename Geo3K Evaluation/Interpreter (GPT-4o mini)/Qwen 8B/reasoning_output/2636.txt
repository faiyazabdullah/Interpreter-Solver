MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and visualize the figure. Let me start by listing out all the points and lines mentioned. 

We have points F, H, C, B, G, E, A, D. Then there are lines: Line(F,D), Line(H,A), Line(C,E). Angles mentioned are Angle(H,B,C), Angle(C,G,E), and Angle(G,E,A). Also, we know that the measure of Angle(H,B,C) is y, Angle(C,G,E) is x, and Angle(G,E,A) is 55 degrees. Additionally, the three lines intersect at point G. 

So, first, I should sketch this mentally. Points F, D connected by a line; H, A connected by another line; C, E connected by a third line. All these lines intersect at point G. Wait, but how? Three lines intersecting at a single point G? That would mean they are concurrent lines meeting at G. So, Line(F,D) intersects Line(H,A) and Line(C,E) at G. Therefore, G is the intersection point of all three lines. 

Now, looking at the angles. The first angle is Angle(H,B,C). So vertex at B, with sides going to H and C. Then Angle(C,G,E) has vertex at G, with sides to C and E. And Angle(G,E,A) is at E, with sides to G and A. 

Also, given that Measure(Angle(G,E,A)) = 55°, so that's one of the angles at E. 

Let me try to map this out. Since lines H-A and C-E intersect at G, maybe forming some triangles. Also, line F-D passes through G. 

Let me think about the angles around point G. Since lines H-A, C-E, and F-D meet at G, there are several angles formed here. For example, the angle between H-A and C-E at G could be part of Angle(C,G,E) and Angle(G,E,A)? Or perhaps not directly. Wait, Angle(C,G,E) is at G, so it's between points C-G-E. So that angle is at G, between lines GC and GE. Similarly, Angle(G,E,A) is at E, between GE and EA. 

Wait, perhaps there's a triangle involved here. Let me consider triangle CEG? Because points C, G, E are connected via lines. But also, since H-A and C-E intersect at G, maybe there are other triangles. 

But the key thing is the angles given. We have Angle(C,G,E) = x, Angle(G,E,A) = 55°, and Angle(H,B,C) = y. The question is to find x. 

I need to relate these angles somehow. Maybe considering straight lines and supplementary angles, or triangle angle sums. 

First, let's note that at point G, where lines H-A, C-E, and F-D meet, the angles around G add up to 360 degrees. However, without knowing more about the configuration, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, if we look at the angles adjacent to each other. 

Looking at Angle(C,G,E) which is at G between C and E. Then Angle(G,E,A) is at E between G and A. Maybe those two angles form a larger angle? Or perhaps they're part of a triangle?

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle EGA. In triangle EGA, we know one angle at E is 55°, but we don't know the others. Unless there are other angles related to that triangle. 

Wait, but how do the other points come into play? There's also point B, which is part of Angle(H,B,C). So point B is somewhere such that H-B-C forms an angle. 

This seems complicated. Let me think again. Since all three lines pass through G, maybe there are vertical angles or linear pairs. 

For instance, the line H-A passes through G. So, at point G, the line H-A splits into segments GH and GA. Similarly, line C-E passes through G, creating segments GC and GE. 

Therefore, at point G, the angles around it would involve these lines. For example, Angle(C,G,E) is between lines GC and GE. So that's one angle. Then, if we consider the line H-A passing through G, there might be angles between HA and other lines. 

Additionally, there's line F-D passing through G. So, the line FD passes through G, creating angles with other lines. 

But how does this connect to the angles given? Let's focus on the angles given. 

We have Angle(C,G,E) = x. This is at G, between C and E. Then Angle(G,E,A) is at E, between G and A. So, if we look at triangle EGA, we have angle at E being 55°, and angle at G being part of something else. Wait, but in triangle EGA, the sum of angles is 180°, but unless we can find other angles in that triangle. 

Wait, maybe there's a way to relate angles at different points. For example, if line C-E passes through G, then line GE is part of that line. Also, line H-A passes through G, so point A is on line HA, and line GE connects to point E. 

Perhaps considering the straight line C-E. At point E, we have angle between GE and EA (which is 55°). Also, if line C-E is straight, then the angle between EC and EA would be... Hmm, but I'm getting confused. 

Another thought: maybe there's a transversal or parallel lines involved? Not sure yet. 

Wait, maybe focusing on the angles at point G. The lines passing through G are HA, CE, and FD. So, at point G, the angles formed by these lines. For example, between HA and CE, there's an angle, and between HA and FD, another angle, etc. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's tricky. 

But we know that Angle(C,G,E) is x. That's the angle between GC and GE. Then, Angle(G,E,A) is at E, between GE and EA. So, maybe the line EA extends from E through G? No, because E is connected to G via line CE. So, line EG is part of CE. Then, point A is on line HA, which passes through G. So, point A is on line HA, which goes through G. Therefore, line HA passes through G, and line GE is part of line CE. 

So, at point E, we have line CE (which includes GE) and line EA (since A is on HA). So, the angle between GE and EA at E is 55°, which is given. 

Now, if we consider triangle EGA, we have angle at E is 55°, and we might find other angles if we can relate them. 

But how does Angle(C,G,E) fit in? That angle is at G, between C and E. So, that's angle CGE. So, in triangle CGE, angle at G is x. 

But how are these triangles connected? Are there any other angles we can use? 

Also, there's Angle(H,B,C) which is at point B, between H and C. So, that's another angle. Maybe involving triangle HBC. 

But without more info on the points' positions, it's challenging. Perhaps there's a way to use the fact that lines intersect at G, leading to certain angle relations. 

Wait, since lines HA and CE intersect at G, the vertical angles at G would be equal. For example, angle HGC equals angle AGE, and angle HGE equals angle AGC. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. When two lines cross, vertical angles are equal. So, if lines HA and CE intersect at G, then the angles opposite each other at G are equal. So, angle HGC and angle EGA would be vertical angles. Wait, but angle EGA is part of the angle at E. 

Alternatively, maybe considering the straight line CE. Since line CE passes through G, then the angle between GC and GE is a straight line? No, because GE is a segment of CE. So, the entire line CE is straight, so angle at G between GC and GE is zero? No, wait. Wait, line CE is straight, so if you take a point G on it, then the line CE is split into two parts: CG and GE. So, the angle between CG and GE at point G would be 180°, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. If you have a straight line CE with point G in between, then the angle between CG and GE is actually a straight angle (180°), but that contradicts the given that Angle(C,G,E) is x. So, that suggests that my assumption is wrong. 

Wait, no. Because Angle(C,G,E) is at point G, between points C, G, E. So, that angle is formed by lines GC and GE. But if C, G, E are colinear, then angle CGE would be 180°, which conflicts with x being some value. Therefore, my earlier conclusion that C, G, E are colinear must be incorrect. Wait, but the given says that Line(C,E) exists, so points C and E are connected by a line. And the intersection of Line(C,E) and Line(H,A) is at point G. So, point G lies on line CE. Therefore, points C, G, E are colinear. Hence, the angle at G between C and E would be 180°, which contradicts the existence of Angle(C,G,E) being x. So there's a contradiction here. What did I misunderstand?

Ah! Wait, maybe Angle(C,G,E) isn't referring to the angle between CG and GE, but rather, the angle at G between lines GC and GE, but since C, G, E are colinear, that angle is a straight angle. But the problem states that MeasureOf(Angle(C,G,E)) is x. Therefore, this implies that my understanding is wrong. How can Angle(C,G,E) exist if points C, G, E are colinear? 

Wait, perhaps the Angle(C,G,E) is not a straight angle. Maybe the line CE is not straight? But the predicate says Line(C,E), so it should be a straight line. This is confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is not formed by the lines CG and GE, but by other lines? Wait, the notation Angle(C,G,E) means the angle at point G, with segments GC and GE. So that's definitely the angle between lines GC and GE. But if C, G, E are colinear, that angle should be 180°, which contradicts the given that it's x. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my interpretation. 

Wait, maybe the line CE is not straight? No, the predicate says Line(C,E), which is a straight line. Therefore, points C, G, E are colinear. Which makes angle CGE a straight angle. But the problem states that MeasureOf(Angle(C,G,E)) is x. So either there's a misunderstanding of the notation, or perhaps there's another line involved. 

Wait, perhaps Angle(C,G,E) refers to a different configuration. Like, maybe the lines aren't colinear? Wait, but the predicate says Line(C,E), which is a straight line. So, point G is on that line. Therefore, points C, G, E are colinear. 

This suggests that there's an error in my previous assumptions. Let me re-examine the given predicates. 

The given predicates include Line(C,E). So, points C and E are connected by a straight line, passing through G. So, C---G---E on a straight line. Then, Angle(C,G,E) would be the angle at G between lines GC and GE, which are in opposite directions along the same line, making a straight angle. But the problem says that MeasureOf(Angle(C,G,E)) is x. So, this suggests that x is 180°, which is impossible since angles in figures like this are usually less than 180°. 

Hmm, this indicates that my initial interpretation is wrong. Perhaps the Angle(C,G,E) is not referring to the angle between GC and GE, but instead involves other lines? Wait, no. The standard notation for Angle(C,G,E) is the angle at point G between points C and E. So, that should be the angle formed by GC and GE. 

Wait, but if C, G, E are colinear, then the angle is straight. So, maybe the angle is not between GC and GE, but between other lines? Like, perhaps there's another line at point G? 

Wait, the lines passing through G are Line(F,D), Line(H,A), and Line(C,E). So, at point G, three lines meet. So, the angle between Line(C,E) and Line(H,A) at G, or between Line(C,E) and Line(F,D) at G. 

But Angle(C,G,E) is specifically the angle at G between C and E. So, if C, G, E are colinear, then the angle between GC and GE is 180°, but that's conflicting with the given x. 

This suggests that there's a misinterpretation of the diagram. Perhaps the line CE is not straight? Or maybe the points are arranged differently. Wait, maybe the line CE is not the same as the line through G? No, the predicate says Line(C,E) and IntersectAt(Line(F,D), Line(H,A), Line(C,E), Point(G)). So, Line(C,E) intersects with Line(F,D) and Line(H,A) at G. Thus, G is on Line(C,E), making C, G, E colinear. 

This seems contradictory. Unless the angle is not a straight angle, but perhaps there's another line involved? Wait, maybe Angle(C,G,E) is not formed by the line CE but by other lines. For example, if there's another line from G to some other point? But according to the given, only lines F-D, H-A, and C-E are mentioned. 

Wait, maybe Angle(C,G,E) is referring to a different configuration. Like, if there's a triangle where G is a vertex, and C and E are other vertices. But how? 

Alternatively, maybe the Angle(C,G,E) is formed by lines GC and GE, but since G is on line CE, that would still imply a straight angle. 

Wait, maybe the problem uses a different notation where Angle(C,G,E) refers to something else. For example, in some contexts, Angle(C,G,E) might refer to the angle at G formed by lines GC and GE, but if those lines are not colinear, but that would require that C and E are not on the same line. But the predicate says Line(C,E), implying they are on the same line. 

This is very confusing. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the problem is in 3D space, but that's unlikely. Or maybe there's a typo in the predicates? 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that all three lines intersect at G. The predicate says IntersectAt(Line(F,D), Line(H,A), Line(C,E), Point(G)). So, the three lines intersect at G. That means that Line(F,D) intersects Line(H,A) at G, and also intersects Line(C,E) at G. So, G is the common intersection point of all three lines. 

Thus, Line(C,E) passes through G, so C, G, E are colinear. So, the angle at G between C and E is 180°, but the problem says it's x. This is a contradiction unless there's a miscalculation. 

Wait, but maybe the angle is not between C-G-E, but between other segments? For example, maybe there's a line from G to another point? But according to the given, the only lines are F-D, H-A, and C-E. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is formed by other lines. For example, Angle(C,G,E) might be formed by lines GC and GE, but GE is part of Line(C,E), and GC is part of Line(C,E), making it a straight angle. 

Unless there's another line involved. Wait, what about the line FG? No, the lines are F-D, H-A, and C-E. 

This seems like a dead end. Maybe I need to reconsider. Perhaps the problem has a typo, or I misread something. Let me check again. 

Given: IntersectAt(Line(F,D), Line(H,A), Line(C,E), Point(G)). So, all three lines intersect at G. So, G is on all three lines. Thus, Line(C,E) passes through G. Hence, C, G, E are colinear. 

Then, Angle(C,G,E) is the angle at G between C and E. Since C, G, E are colinear, this angle is 180°, but the problem states it's x. This suggests that either the problem is flawed, or I misunderstood the notation. 

Wait, maybe the angle is not between C-G-E but between other points? For example, maybe it's Angle(C,G,H)? No, the given is Angle(C,G,E). 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is formed by lines GC and another line, not GE. But the notation Angle(C,G,E) specifies the angle at G between C and E, so it must be between GC and GE. 

This is perplexing. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem setup. Let me try to think of alternative interpretations. 

Maybe the line CE is not straight? But the predicate says Line(C,E), which should be straight. 

Alternatively, maybe G is not on line CE? But the predicate says IntersectAt(..., Point(G)), so G is on all three lines. 

Wait, unless the lines are not extended infinitely? But in standard geometric terms, a line is infinite. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is formed by lines from G to other points. For example, Angle(C,G,E) could be formed by lines GC and GE, but if there's another line from G to another point? But the given only mentions lines F-D, H-A, and C-E. 

Wait, perhaps the angle is formed by lines from G to C and from G to E, but those are collinear, hence straight angle. 

This suggests that there's an inconsistency, but since the problem is presented as solvable, I must be missing something. 

Let me try to look at other parts of the problem. We know that Angle(G,E,A) is 55°, which is at point E between G and A. So, at point E, we have line GE (part of line CE) and line EA (part of line HA). Since line HA passes through G, so point A is on line HA, which goes through G. So, line EA is connected to E and A, with G being on line HA. 

So, at point E, the angle between GE and EA is 55°. Now, since line CE passes through G, and E is on line CE, then line EA starts at E and goes to A, which is on line HA passing through G. 

So, at point E, we have two lines: GE (along CE towards G) and EA (going to A on HA). So, the angle between GE and EA is 55°. 

Now, if I consider triangle EGA, we have angle at E of 55°, and we might find other angles if we can relate them. 

But how does Angle(C,G,E) factor in? If that angle is at G between C and E, which are colinear, making it 180°, but the problem says it's x. This suggests that there's a miscalculation or a misinterpretation. 

Wait, perhaps the Angle(C,G,E) is not between GC and GE, but between other lines? Like, maybe it's between GC and another line? Or maybe the angle is at G between lines GC and something else? 

Wait, the notation Angle(C,G,E) typically means the angle at G between points C and E. So, it's the angle formed by connecting C to G to E. But if C, G, E are colinear, then this is a straight angle. 

But since the problem gives that this angle is x, which is presumably a valid angle (not 180°), there must be a different interpretation. 

Wait, perhaps the Angle(C,G,E) is not a straight angle because there's another line at G. For example, if line CE is not straight, but that contradicts the predicate. 

Alternatively, maybe the Angle(C,G,E) is formed by lines GC and another line, not GE. But the notation specifies E as the second point. 

Wait, unless the angle is formed by lines GC and HE? No, the notation is Angle(C,G,E), so the middle point is G. 

This is really confusing. Given that the problem is solvable, and the answer choices are numerical, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that there's a misinterpretation of the angle, and try to work through it. 

Assume that Angle(C,G,E) is not a straight angle, which implies that points C, G, E are not colinear. But the predicate says Line(C,E), so they must be colinear. 

This is a paradox. Maybe the error is in the assumption that all three lines intersect at G? Or maybe the lines are not all intersecting at G? Wait, the predicate says IntersectAt(Line(F,D), Line(H,A), Line(C,E), Point(G)), which means all three lines intersect at G. 

Wait, unless two of the lines intersect at G, and the third line passes through G as well. So, Line(C,E) passes through G, and Line(F,D) and Line(H,A) also pass through G. 

So, if I imagine three lines intersecting at G: one horizontal, one vertical, and one diagonal. But in this case, Line(C,E) is one of them. 

If Line(C,E) passes through G, then C and E are on a line passing through G. So, points C, G, E are colinear. 

But then, the angle at G between C and E would be a straight angle. 

But the problem states that this angle is x. So, maybe x is 180°, but that's not among the options. The answer choices are 55, 115, 125, 135. None of these are 180. 

This suggests that there's a fundamental flaw in my understanding. Let me try to think differently. 

Perhaps the Angle(C,G,E) is not the angle between GC and GE, but between GC and another line. For example, if there's another line from G to another point. But according to the given, only lines F-D, H-A, and C-E are present. 

Wait, maybe the angle is at G between lines GC and GD? But there's no mention of D in the angle. 

Alternatively, maybe the Angle(C,G,E) is formed by lines GC and GE, but since G is on line CE, it's a straight angle. So, perhaps the angle is measured as the reflex angle, which is 360° - 180° = 180°, but that doesn't change anything. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is formed by lines from G to C and from G to another point, like G to H? But the notation is Angle(C,G,E), so it's C-G-E. 

This is extremely puzzling. Perhaps the problem has a typo, or I need to reinterpret the angle notation. 

Wait, another possibility: maybe the angle is not at G, but at C? No, the notation is Angle(C,G,E), which means the angle at G. 

Given that I'm stuck here, perhaps I should assume that there's a misinterpretation and move forward with the available information. Let's suppose that despite C, G, E being colinear, the angle at G is x. Maybe the problem considers the angle between GC and another line, like the line from G to another point. 

Wait, since Line(F,D) passes through G, maybe the angle at G between GC and GF? Or between GC and GD? 

If that's the case, then Angle(C,G,E) might be referring to a different configuration. But without explicit information, this is speculative. 

Alternatively, perhaps the Angle(C,G,E) is referring to a triangle where C, G, and E are vertices, but with G not on line CE. But the predicate says Line(C,E), so they must be on a line. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Perhaps I need to look at other parts of the problem. 

We know that Angle(G,E,A) is 55°, which is at E between G and A. Also, Line(H,A) passes through G. So, point A is on line HA, which goes through G. 

So, at point E, we have line EA (from E to A) and line GE (from E to G). These form a 55° angle. 

If I consider triangle EGA, we have angle at E of 55°, and if I can find other angles in this triangle, maybe I can relate them to x. 

But to do that, I need information about other angles. 

Alternatively, since line CE passes through G, and line HA passes through G, maybe there are vertical angles or supplementary angles at G. 

For example, the angle between HA and CE at G. Let's say that angle is θ. Then, since line CE is straight, the angle between HA and CE at G would be θ, and the supplementary angle would be 180° - θ. 

But how does this relate to the given angles? 

Wait, if we consider the angle at G between HA and CE, which would be between lines HG and GE (assuming HA passes through G). Wait, this is getting too vague. 

Let me try to assign variables. Let's denote:

Let’s call the angle at G between lines HA and CE as α. Since line HA passes through G, and line CE passes through G, they form an angle α at G. 

Also, since line CE is straight, the angle between CG and GE is a straight angle, but this conflicts with the given x. 

Alternatively, if the angle at G between HA and CE is α, then the angle between HA and CE at G is α. 

But how does this relate to Angle(C,G,E)? If Angle(C,G,E) is part of this angle α? 

This is too ambiguous without a clear diagram. 

Since I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's consider the answer choices and see if any of them make sense. 

The answer choices are 55, 115, 125, 135. 

We know that Angle(G,E,A) is 55°. If x is 115°, then maybe it relates to supplementary angles. For example, if x + 55° = 180°, then x would be 125°, but that's not matching. Wait, 180 - 55 = 125. So if x and 55° are supplementary, x would be 125°. 

Alternatively, if x is part of a triangle where the other angles sum to 55°, but without knowing more, it's guesswork. 

But since the answer choices include 125, which is 180 - 55, this might suggest that x is 125°. 

However, this is just a guess. To justify it, let's assume that Angle(C,G,E) and Angle(G,E,A) are supplementary. Why? Because they might form a linear pair. 

If line CE is straight, and line EA is extending from E through G, then at point E, the angle between GE and EA is 55°, and if there's another angle at E forming a linear pair with it, it would be 180 - 55 = 125°. But where would that angle be? 

Alternatively, if Angle(C,G,E) is at G, and Angle(G,E,A) is at E, they might be part of a triangle or something. 

But without a clear diagram, it's hard to tell. 

Given the lack of clarity, but needing to choose from the options, I'll go with 125°, which is 180 - 55, suggesting supplementary angles. So, Final Answer: C.
