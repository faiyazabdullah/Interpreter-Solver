MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing them out again to make sure I don't miss anything.

So, we have several RightAngle predicates. The first one says RightAngle(Angle(Y, A, N)). That means the angle at point A formed by points Y, A, N is a right angle. Similarly, the second one is RightAngle(Angle(A, N, B)), so the angle at point N formed by points A, N, B is also a right angle. 

Then there are length equalities. LengthOf(Line(Y, A)) equals 5, so YA = 5. LengthOf(Line(Y, B)) is y, so YB = y. LengthOf(Line(A, B)) is z, so AB = z. LengthOf(Line(N, B)) is x, so NB = x. Also, LengthOf(Line(Y, N)) is 14, so YN = 14. 

Next, positioning: PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(Y, N)) means point A is on the line connecting Y and N. Similarly, point B lies on the same line YN. And point N lies on line AB. Wait, that seems important. So points Y, A, N, B are colinear? Because A and B are both on line YN. But wait, N is on line AB. Hmm, maybe forming some sort of configuration where lines intersect?

Let me try to visualize this. Points Y, A, N, B are all on the same straight line YN. So Y----A----N----B? Or maybe different order? Since A and B lie on line YN, but N is on line AB. So line AB passes through N. Therefore, points A, N, B are colinear, and since A and B are on YN, that suggests that line AB is part of line YN. Therefore, points Y, A, N, B are all on a straight line. Wait, but if N is on AB, then AB is a segment passing through N, and since A and B are on YN, then AB is a subset of YN. So perhaps the entire line YN includes points Y, A, N, B in some order. 

But then we also have right angles at A and N. Let me think about that. The first right angle is at A: Angle(Y, A, N) is a right angle. So if points Y, A, N are colinear, then the angle at A would be between lines AY and AN. But if Y, A, N are colinear, then those two lines would form a straight line, making the angle 180 degrees, not a right angle. That seems contradictory. Wait, this must mean that my initial assumption about the colinearity is wrong. Maybe points Y, A, N are not colinear? But the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(Y, N)), so A is on line YN. Similarly, B is on line YN. So points Y, A, N, B are all on line YN. Then why does the angle at A being a right angle exist?

Wait, maybe the angle isn't between YA and AN, but something else? Let me clarify. The angle is Angle(Y, A, N), which typically denotes the angle at point A between points Y and N. So vertex at A, with segments AY and AN. But if Y, A, N are colinear, then AY and AN are parts of the same line, so the angle between them would be straight, 180 degrees. Which contradicts the right angle. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here. How can that be?

Ah! Perhaps the points aren't in the order Y-A-N-B on the line. Maybe the line YN has points Y and N, and A and B are somewhere else? Wait, no. The predicate says PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(Y, N)), so A is on line YN. Similarly, B is on line YN. So A and B are two distinct points on line YN. Additionally, N lies on line AB. So line AB contains point N. Therefore, points A, N, B are colinear, and since A and B are on line YN, then line AB is a part of line YN. Therefore, line YN must contain points Y, A, N, B in some order. However, if that's the case, then the angle at A between Y and N would be a straight angle. Hence, contradiction. Therefore, there must be another interpretation.

Alternatively, perhaps the line AB is not the same as YN? Wait, but the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(N, Line(A,B)), so N lies on line AB. And points A and B lie on line YN. Therefore, line AB intersects line YN at point N. Wait, but if A and B are on line YN, then line AB is the same as line YN. Unless A and B are such that line AB is different. Wait, but if both A and B lie on line YN, then line AB is just a segment of line YN. So, for example, suppose line YN has points Y, then A, then N, then B. Then line AB would be from A to B, passing through N. In this case, the angle at A between Y and N would be between AY and AN. But since Y, A, N are colinear, that angle is 180 degrees. Still a contradiction. So what's wrong here?

Wait, maybe the angle isn't between AY and AN, but something else? Wait, the angle is Angle(Y, A, N). So the angle at A between Y and N. So if points Y and N are on opposite sides of A, then it could form a right angle. For example, if A is between Y and N, then the angle at A between Y and N would be a straight angle. But if A is not between Y and N? Wait, but A is on line YN. So either A is between Y and N, or outside. Suppose Y and N are fixed points, and A is a point on line YN. If A is not between Y and N, then the line YN extends beyond A. But how can there be a right angle at A? 

Alternatively, maybe the line AB is perpendicular to YN? Because there's a right angle at A and another at N. Let me think. If there's a right angle at A (between Y and N), then the lines AY and AN must be perpendicular. But if A is on line YN, then AY and AN are along the same line, unless... Wait, unless Y and N are not on the same line as A. But the predicate says A is on line YN. So this seems impossible. There's a contradiction here. Maybe the problem involves more than just line YN? Like, maybe there's another line involved?

Wait, looking back at the right angles: RightAngle(Angle(Y, A, N)) implies that angle at A between Y and N is 90 degrees. Similarly, RightAngle(Angle(A, N, B)) implies angle at N between A and B is 90 degrees. So these two right angles suggest that lines AY and AN are perpendicular, and lines NA and NB are perpendicular. So if angle at A between Y and N is 90°, then AY ⊥ AN. Similarly, angle at N between A and B is 90°, so NA ⊥ NB. 

Therefore, combining these, we get that AY ⊥ AN and NA ⊥ NB, implying that AY is parallel to NB. Because if two lines are both perpendicular to the same line (NA), then they are parallel. 

Now, considering that A is on line YN. Let me draw this mentally. Let me consider coordinates to model this. Let me assign coordinates to points to simplify. Let's place point Y at (0, 0). Since YN has length 14, let me assume that N is at (14, 0). Now, point A is on line YN. Let me denote A as (a, 0), where a is between 0 and 14, or outside. 

Since angle at A between Y and N is a right angle, which would require that AY ⊥ AN. But if Y is (0,0), A is (a,0), and N is (14,0), then vector AY is from A to Y: (-a, 0), and vector AN is from A to N: (14 - a, 0). These vectors are both horizontal, so their dot product is (-a)(14 - a) + 0*0 = -14a + a². For them to be perpendicular, the dot product should be zero. So -14a + a² = 0 → a(a -14)=0 → a=0 or a=14. But that would put A at Y or N, which conflicts with the existence of point B. So this suggests inconsistency. 

This indicates that my coordinate assumption may be incorrect. Perhaps line YN is not horizontal? Wait, but I assumed it was. Alternatively, maybe points Y, A, N are not colinear? But the predicate states that A lies on line YN. 

This contradiction suggests that my understanding is flawed. Let me re-examine the problem. 

Perhaps the line AB is not the same as line YN? Wait, but the predicate says that point N lies on line AB. So line AB passes through N. Also, points A and B are on line YN. Therefore, line AB is the same as line YN. Therefore, points A, B, N are on line YN. Thus, the previous scenario applies. 

But then how can there be a right angle at A between Y and N? It seems impossible. Therefore, there must be an error in interpreting the angle. Wait, maybe the angle is not between AY and AN, but between other lines? Wait, Angle(Y, A, N) is defined as the angle at A formed by points Y, A, N. So it's the angle between AY and AN. But if Y, A, N are colinear, then that angle is straight. Hence, contradiction. Therefore, there must be a mistake in assuming that A is on line YN. 

Wait, but the predicate explicitly states PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(Y, N)), so A is on line YN. This is confusing. Maybe the problem involves three-dimensional geometry? No, the problem likely assumes planar geometry. 

Alternatively, perhaps the line YN is not straight? No, a line is straight by definition. 

Hmm. This seems like a paradox. Let me check the problem statement again. Oh! Wait, the first right angle is Angle(Y, A, N), which is a right angle. The second is Angle(A, N, B), also a right angle. So if we consider that these angles are not in the same plane? But that complicates things. 

Alternatively, maybe points Y, A, N, B form a rectangle or square? Let me think. Suppose we have two right angles at A and N. So if we have A connected to Y and N, forming a right angle, and N connected to A and B, forming another right angle. So imagine a right angle at A between Y and N, and a right angle at N between A and B. That would imply that AY is perpendicular to AN, and AN is perpendicular to NB. So AY is parallel to NB. 

If that's the case, then AY || NB. Now, since A and B are on line YN, then line YN contains points A and B. So if AY is parallel to NB, then perhaps triangle AYN and triangle NBN are similar? Not sure yet. 

Let me try assigning coordinates again, but this time allowing for non-colinear points. Suppose point Y is at (0,0), point N is at (14,0) because YN has length 14. Now, point A is somewhere such that angle at A between Y and N is 90 degrees. Let me define coordinates for A. 

Let’s say point A is at (x, y). Then vectors AY and AN are from A to Y and A to N. Vector AY is (0 - x, 0 - y) = (-x, -y). Vector AN is (14 - x, 0 - y) = (14 - x, -y). Their dot product should be zero because the angle is 90 degrees. 

Dot product: (-x)(14 - x) + (-y)(-y) = -14x + x² + y² = 0. 

So equation: x² -14x + y² = 0. 

Additionally, point A lies on line YN. Wait, earlier assumption said line YN is the x-axis from (0,0) to (14,0). But if A is on line YN, then its y-coordinate must be 0. But then y = 0, so substituting into the above equation gives x² -14x = 0 → x(x -14) = 0 → x=0 or x=14. But those are points Y and N themselves. Hence, contradiction. 

Thus, the only way for A to be on line YN and satisfy the right angle condition is if A coincides with Y or N, which isn't allowed since A and B are distinct points. Therefore, there's a fundamental issue here. 

Wait, maybe the line YN isn't straight? No, it's a line. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves a three-dimensional setup where the points are not coplanar? But that's unlikely without specification. 

Alternatively, maybe the right angles are not in the same plane? But again, standard geometry problems assume planar. 

I'm stuck. Let me look at the other predicates to see if I missed something. 

We also have LengthOf(Line(Y, B)) = y, LengthOf(Line(A, B)) = z, LengthOf(Line(N, B)) = x. Also, PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(Y, N)), so B is on line YN. And PointLiesOnLine(N, Line(A, B)), so N is on AB. 

Given that, and the right angles, perhaps there's a way to use Pythagoras. 

Wait, maybe the figure consists of two right triangles sharing a common leg? 

For instance, if we consider triangle YAN with right angle at A, and triangle ANB with right angle at N. 

In triangle YAN, right-angled at A, so YA^2 + AN^2 = YN^2. Given that YA is 5, YN is 14, so 5^2 + AN^2 = 14^2 → AN^2 = 196 -25 = 171 → AN = sqrt(171) = 3√19. 

Similarly, in triangle ANB, right-angled at N, so AN^2 + NB^2 = AB^2. Here, AN is sqrt(171), NB is x, and AB is z. So z^2 = 171 + x^2. 

But we also know that AB is the distance between points A and B. Since both A and B are on line YN, the distance AB would be |distance from A to Y minus distance from B to Y| or something similar. Wait, but if A and B are on line YN, then AB is the absolute difference between their distances from Y or N. 

Wait, let's assume that points Y, A, N, B are arranged on line YN. Let me define variables. Let me denote the position of Y as 0, N as 14 units away (since YN = 14). Let me assign coordinates to Y at 0, N at 14. 

Point A is somewhere on line YN. Let me call the coordinate of A as 'a', so YA = |a - 0| = |a|. But since YA is given as 5, then |a| = 5. So a = 5 or a = -5. 

But then, since angle at A between Y and N is 90 degrees, which would require that AY ⊥ AN. However, if A is at 5 on the line YN (from Y at 0 to N at 14), then vector AY is from A to Y: direction towards left, and vector AN is from A to N: direction towards right. These are colinear, hence not perpendicular. Contradiction again. 

Wait, but earlier calculation suggested that if we treat A as (x,y), then the condition gives x² -14x + y² = 0. But if A is on line YN, which we've taken as the x-axis, then y=0, leading to x² -14x =0 → x=0 or x=14. So no solution except Y or N. 

This suggests that the only way to satisfy both conditions (right angle at A and A lying on YN) is if A is at Y or N. But that can't be, as A is a separate point. 

This contradiction implies that my initial assumptions about the configuration are wrong. Perhaps the line YN is not the same as line AB? But the predicate says N lies on line AB. 

Wait, maybe line AB is not the same as line YN. Let me think differently. Suppose that points Y and N are not on the same line as A and B. Instead, points A and B are on line YN, and line AB passes through N. So line AB intersects line YN at point N. 

But then, if A and B are on line YN, and line AB passes through N, then N is between A and B. So the line AB is the same as line YN. Hence, returning to the previous contradiction. 

Alternatively, perhaps A and B are not on the same line as Y and N? But the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(Y, N)), so A is on YN. Same for B. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should proceed with the earlier idea of treating the two right triangles, even though there's a contradiction in the configuration. 

Assume that triangle YAN is right-angled at A, giving YA^2 + AN^2 = YN^2. With YA = 5, YN = 14, so AN^2 = 14² - 5² = 196 - 25 = 171. Then, triangle ANB is right-angled at N, so AN^2 + NB^2 = AB^2. Thus, AB^2 = 171 + NB^2. But NB is x, and AB is z. So z^2 = x^2 + 171. 

However, we need to find z, so we need to find x. How can we relate x to other known quantities? 

From the given, LengthOf(Line(N, B)) = x. Since B is on line YN, and N is on line AB, which is the same as line YN. So B is a point on line YN, and N is between A and B? Or not? 

Let me consider the positions. Assume that line YN has points Y, then A, then N, then B. But then AN would be the distance from A to N, and NB would be from N to B. So AB = AN + NB = sqrt(171) + x. But AB is also z. So z = sqrt(171) + x. But we don't know x. 

Alternatively, if A is between Y and N, and B is beyond N. Then AN is the distance from A to N, NB is from N to B. So AB = AN + NB = sqrt(171) + x, hence z = sqrt(171) + x. But without knowing x, we can't compute z. 

Wait, but we also have LengthOf(Line(Y, B)) = y. Since B is on line YN, the distance from Y to B is YN + NB if B is beyond N, or YN - NB if B is between Y and N. 

But we don't know the position of B. Without knowing whether B is on one side or the other, it's hard to determine. 

But maybe we can express y in terms of x and other known values. For example, if B is beyond N from Y, then YB = YN + NB = 14 + x. Hence, y = 14 + x. 

If B is between Y and N, then YB = YN - NB = 14 - x, so y = 14 - x. 

But we don't have information about y. So this introduces another variable. 

But the question asks for z, which is AB. From earlier, z = sqrt(171) + x (if B is beyond N), or z = sqrt(171) - x (if B is between Y and N). But without knowing where B is located, we can't determine z directly. 

Is there any other relation involving x or y? 

Wait, we also have LengthOf(Line(A, B)) = z, and LengthOf(Line(N, B)) = x. If B is beyond N from Y, then AB = AN + NB = sqrt(171) + x, and NB = x. So z = sqrt(171) + x. But how do we find x? 

Alternatively, if we consider triangle YNB. Wait, but we don't have info about angles there. 

Wait, but maybe we can use the fact that point N lies on line AB. Since N is on AB, and B is on line YN, then line AB is line YN. Hence, AB is part of line YN. Thus, the distance from A to B is |position of B - position of A|. 

But without knowing the exact positions, it's still unclear. 

Wait, but we have YA = 5, YN = 14. If A is between Y and N, then YA = 5, so AN = YN - YA = 14 - 5 = 9. But earlier calculation from the right angle gave AN^2 = 171, which would mean AN = sqrt(171) ≈ 13.07, which doesn't match 9. Contradiction. 

Alternatively, if A is not between Y and N, but extended beyond Y. Let's say A is on the extension of YN beyond Y. Then YA = 5, so the distance from Y to A is 5, and YN is 14. So N is 14 units from Y, while A is 5 units from Y in the opposite direction. Then AN would be YN + YA = 14 + 5 = 19. Hence, AN = 19, so AN^2 = 361. But according to the right angle condition, AN^2 should be 171. Again, contradiction. 

This suggests that the assumption of the right angle at A is conflicting with the placement of A on line YN. Hence, there must be an alternative interpretation. 

Maybe the right angles are not in the same plane? Or maybe the diagram involves folded lines? 

Alternatively, perhaps the lines YN and AB are not straight? No, they're lines. 

Wait, let's consider that the right angles are not in the same line. Maybe the figure is three-dimensional. For example, points Y, A, N, B form a rectangular box? But without more information, this is too speculative. 

Alternatively, maybe the right angles are at A and N, but the lines involved are not colinear. For example, if AY is perpendicular to AN, and AN is perpendicular to NB, but AY and NB are not necessarily colinear. 

Wait, if AY ⊥ AN and AN ⊥ NB, then AY || NB. So AY and NB are parallel. 

If A is on line YN, and B is on line YN, then NB is a segment on line YN. If AY is parallel to NB, then AY and NB are both parallel to each other. 

But AY is a segment from A to Y, and NB is a segment from N to B. If they are parallel, then the direction from A to Y is the same as from N to B. 

Let me try to set up coordinates again, with this in mind. Let me assume that line YN is horizontal for simplicity. Let me take Y at (0, 0), N at (14, 0). Let me assume that A is at some point (a, b), and B is at some point (c, d). 

Since A lies on line YN, which is the x-axis, so b = 0. Hence, A is (a, 0). Similarly, B is on line YN, so B is (c, 0). 

Now, the right angle at A between Y and N: vectors AY and AN. AY is from A to Y: (0 - a, 0 - 0) = (-a, 0). AN is from A to N: (14 - a, 0 - 0) = (14 - a, 0). These vectors are both horizontal, so they are colinear, hence angle is 180°, not 90°. Contradiction again. 

Unless... unless the right angle is not between AY and AN, but between other lines? Wait, the angle is Angle(Y, A, N), which is the angle at A between Y and N. So it's the angle between AY and AN. But if both are along the x-axis, then it's straight. 

This suggests that the only way for this angle to be 90° is if AY and AN are not colinear. But since A is on line YN, they are colinear. Hence, this is impossible. 

This leads me to believe that there's a misinterpretation of the angle notation. Maybe the angle is not between AY and AN, but between other lines? For example, if the angle is at A between lines that are not AY and AN, but something else. 

Wait, the angle notation Angle(Y, A, N) typically represents the angle at A between points Y and N, i.e., ∠YAN. So it's the angle at A between lines AY and AN. 

But if A is on line YN, then AY and AN are parts of the same line, making the angle straight. Hence, the only way for this to be a right angle is if the points are arranged such that AY and AN are not colinear, which contradicts A being on line YN. 

This is very perplexing. Perhaps there's a typo in the problem, or I'm missing something. 

Wait, let me try to focus on the given data and see what can be deduced regardless of the contradiction. 

From the right angles, we have two right triangles: YAN and ANB. Assuming they are right-angled at A and N respectively. 

Using Pythagoras on triangle YAN: YA^2 + AN^2 = YN^2. Given YA = 5, YN = 14, so AN^2 = 14² - 5² = 196 - 25 = 171. 

Then, in triangle ANB, right-angled at N: AN^2 + NB^2 = AB^2. So AB^2 = 171 + NB^2. 

But NB is x, and AB is z. So z^2 = 171 + x^2. 

But how to find x? 

Looking at other given data: LengthOf(Line(Y, B)) = y. Since B is on line YN, and N is on line AB, which is the same as line YN, then the distance from Y to B depends on the position of B relative to Y and N. 

If we assume that B is on the extension of YN beyond N, then YB = YN + NB = 14 + x. So y = 14 + x. 

If B is between Y and N, then YB = YN - NB = 14 - x. 

But without knowing the position of B, we can't determine x. However, the problem asks for z, and we have z^2 = 171 + x^2. 

But we need another equation to relate x and y. 

Wait, but we have LengthOf(Line(A, B)) = z, and LengthOf(Line(Y, B)) = y. If B is on line YN, then AB = |AB|, and YB = |YB|. Depending on the position of B, we can write AB in terms of YB and other known lengths. 

Let me consider two cases:

Case 1: B is on the extension of YN beyond N. Then YB = YN + NB = 14 + x, and AB = AN + NB = sqrt(171) + x. 

But AB is z, so z = sqrt(171) + x. 

Also, YB = y = 14 + x. 

So we have two equations: 
z = sqrt(171) + x 
y = 14 + x 

But we don't know y. 

Case 2: B is between Y and N. Then YB = YN - NB = 14 - x, and AB = YN - YA - NB = 14 - 5 - x = 9 - x. 

But AB is z, so z = 9 - x. 

And YB = y = 14 - x. 

Again, without knowing y, we can't determine x. 

But the problem doesn't provide y or x, so how can we find z? 

Wait, but maybe there's another relationship. Let me recall that PointLiesOnLine(N, Line(A, B)), which means N is on AB. Since A and B are on line YN, this means that N is on line YN, which it already is. 

But if N is on AB, then AB is a line containing N, and since A and B are on YN, this confirms that AB is part of YN. 

But without knowing where B is, we can't determine x. 

However, the answer choices include options like 3√19, which is approximately 13.07, and others. 

Wait, in the first case, if z = sqrt(171) + x, and in the second case z = 9 - x. But we don't know x. 

Wait, but if we assume that B is on the extension of YN beyond N, then x is positive. If B is between Y and N, x is positive as well. 

But without more information, it's impossible to determine x. 

Wait, but maybe there's another relationship from the given data. We have LengthOf(Line(Y, B)) = y, and LengthOf(Line(N, B)) = x. So y = NB + YN if B is beyond N, or y = YN - NB if B is between Y and N. 

But since we don't know where B is, this remains unresolved. 

However, the problem asks for z, which is AB. From the right triangles, we have z^2 = 171 + x^2. If we can express x in terms of other known quantities, we can find z. 

But how? 

Wait, perhaps using the fact that point A is on line YN. If we assume that A is between Y and N, then YA = 5, YN = 14, so AN = YN - YA = 9. But earlier, from the right triangle, we had AN^2 = 171, so AN = sqrt(171) ≈ 13.07, which contradicts AN = 9. Hence, this suggests that A is not between Y and N. 

If A is not between Y and N, then it's either on the extension beyond Y or beyond N. 

Let's assume A is beyond Y, so that YA = 5, and AN = YA + YN = 5 + 14 = 19. Then AN^2 = 361, which doesn't match the 171 from before. 

Alternatively, if A is beyond N, then YA = YN + NA = 14 + NA. But YA is given as 5, so 14 + NA = 5 → NA = -9, which is not possible since lengths are positive. 

This suggests that the only possibility is that the initial assumption about the right angles is incorrect, or there's an error in the problem setup. 

But since the problem is given, there must be a solution. Let me try to proceed despite the contradictions. 

Assuming that the right triangles give us z^2 = 171 + x^2, and if we can find x from elsewhere. 

Wait, what if we consider triangle YNB? If B is on line YN, then YB = y, and NB = x. So YB = YN + NB or YN - NB depending on B's position. 

If we assume B is beyond N, then YB = 14 + x, and y = 14 + x. 

But we don't know y. 

Alternatively, if we consider that the length AB = z, and AB = AN + NB = sqrt(171) + x, and also AB = YB - YA if B is beyond N. Wait, if B is beyond N, then YB = YN + NB = 14 + x, and AB = YB - YA = (14 + x) - 5 = 9 + x. 

But we also have AB = sqrt(171) + x. So equating:

9 + x = sqrt(171) + x → 9 = sqrt(171), which is false since sqrt(171) ≈ 13.07. 

Contradiction again. 

If B is between Y and N, then YB = YN - NB = 14 - x, and AB = YN - YA - NB = 14 - 5 - x = 9 - x. 

But from the right triangle, AB = sqrt(171) + x (assuming B is beyond N) or AB = sqrt(171) - x (if B is between Y and N)? 

Wait, if B is between Y and N, then AB = YN - YA - NB = 14 - 5 - x = 9 - x. 

But from the right triangle, AB^2 = 171 + x^2. So:

(9 - x)^2 = 171 + x^2  
Expanding: 81 - 18x + x^2 = 171 + x^2  
Subtract x^2 from both sides: 81 - 18x = 171  
→ -18x = 171 - 81 = 90  
→ x = -5. 

Negative x implies that B is on the other side of N, which would mean our assumption about B being between Y and N is wrong. 

This suggests that x is negative, which would mean B is on the extension of YN beyond N, but then our earlier assumption would be invalid. 

This is getting too tangled. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll try to proceed with the earlier result from the right triangles. 

From the first right triangle, AN^2 = 171, so AN = sqrt(171). 

Then, in the second right triangle, AB^2 = AN^2 + NB^2 = 171 + x^2. 

But we need to find z = AB. 

If I assume that x is such that z is among the answer choices, let's test the options. 

Option C is 3√19. Let's calculate 3√19 ≈ 3*4.358 ≈ 13.07. 

If z = 3√19, then z^2 = 9*19 = 171. 

So if z^2 = 171 + x^2 = 171 → x^2 = 0 → x = 0. 

But x is the length of NB, which would mean B coincides with N, which is not allowed. 

Option A is sqrt(19) ≈ 4.358. Squared is 19. So 171 + x^2 = 19 → x^2 = -152, impossible. 

Option B is 5. Squared is 25. 25 = 171 + x^2 → x^2 = -146, nope. 

Option D is 14. Squared is 196 = 171 + x^2 → x^2 = 25 → x = 5. 

So if x = 5, then NB = 5. 

But how does this fit? 

If x = 5, then NB = 5. If B is beyond N, then YB = 14 + 5 = 19, so y = 19. 

But we don't have y given, so it's possible. 

Also, AB = z = 14. 

But how does this connect? 

If AB = 14, and AN = sqrt(171), then from the right triangle: AB^2 = AN^2 + NB^2 → 14^2 = 171 + 5^2 → 196 = 171 + 25 → 196 = 196. Correct. 

So this works! 

But how did we arrive at AB = 14? 

Because if x = 5, then NB = 5, and AB = sqrt(171) + x = sqrt(171) + 5. Wait, no, if B is beyond N, then AB = AN + NB = sqrt(171) + 5, which would be greater than 14. But according to this, AB = 14. 

Wait, there's a contradiction here. 

Wait, no. If AB^2 = 171 + x^2 = 196 → x^2 = 25 → x = 5. So NB = 5. 

But AB = sqrt(171 + x^2) = sqrt(196) = 14. 

So AB = 14. 

But how does this relate to the positions? 

If AB = 14, and AN = sqrt(171), and NB = 5, then by the Pythagorean theorem, it holds. 

But how does this happen geometrically? 

If AB is 14, and NB is 5, then AN = sqrt(AB^2 - NB^2) = sqrt(196 - 25) = sqrt(171), which matches. 

But how does this fit with the positions of A and B on line YN? 

Let me assume that A is at a certain position, and B is such that NB = 5. 

If N is at 14 units from Y, and NB = 5, then B is 5 units from N. Depending on direction, B could be at 14 + 5 = 19 or 14 - 5 = 9. 

If B is at 9, then YB = 9 units, so y = 9. 

If B is at 19, YB = 19, y = 19. 

But how does this relate to A? 

Recall that YA = 5. If A is on line YN, then YA = 5 means A is 5 units from Y. So if Y is at 0, A is at 5. Then AN is the distance from A (5) to N (14), which is 9. But earlier, from the right triangle, AN^2 = 171, which would mean AN = sqrt(171). Contradiction. 

But if we ignore that contradiction and proceed, assuming that the right triangle gives us AN^2 = 171, and AB^2 = 171 + x^2, and with x = 5, then AB = 14. 

Even though the geometric configuration seems inconsistent, the algebraic relations hold. 

Given that, and the answer choice D is 14, which satisfies the equation, this might be the intended answer. 

Hence, despite the contradictions in the geometric configuration, the answer is D.
