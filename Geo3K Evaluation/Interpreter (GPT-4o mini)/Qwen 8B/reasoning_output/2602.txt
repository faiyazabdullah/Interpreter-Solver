====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse the given predicates and understand the setup. 

So, the problem states that we have a triangle ABC. Then there's a right angle at point A, specifically Angle(B,A,C) is a right angle. That means triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at vertex A. 

Next, we're told that the measure of angle at point C (which would be Angle(C,B,A)) is 2x, and the measure of angle at point B (Angle(B,C,A)) is x. Wait, hold on, maybe I should double-check the notation here. Let me clarify the angles. 

In angle notation, Angle(B,A,C) refers to the angle at point A, formed by points B, A, and C. So that's the right angle, so angle BAC is 90 degrees. Then, MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,A)) equals x. Wait, Angle(B,C,A) would be the angle at point C, formed by points B, C, A. Similarly, MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,A)) equals 2x. Let me confirm: Angle(C,B,A) is the angle at point B, formed by points C, B, A. 

Wait, but in a triangle, the sum of all angles is 180 degrees. Since it's a right-angled triangle at A, the other two angles at B and C must add up to 90 degrees. But according to the given, one of them is x and the other is 2x? Wait, no—let me re-examine.

Wait, the first part says RightAngle(Angle(B,A,C)), which is angle at A, so that's 90 degrees. Then, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,A)), x). Let me parse Angle(B,C,A): that's angle at point C, with segments CB and CA. So angle at C is x. Then Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,A)), 2x). Angle(C,B,A) is angle at point B, with segments BC and BA. So angle at B is 2x. 

Therefore, in triangle ABC, angles at A, B, C are 90°, 2x, and x respectively. Wait, but wait, angle at A is 90°, angle at B is 2x, angle at C is x. Sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, so 90 + 2x + x = 180 → 3x = 90 → x=30°. 

But wait, that seems straightforward. However, the answer options are A.10, B.20, C.30, D.40. So if x is 30, then answer C. But let me check again. 

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the angles. Let me make sure. Let me label the triangle properly. Points A, B, C. Right angle at A, so sides AB and AC are perpendicular. Then angle at B is angle ABC, and angle at C is angle ACB. 

Given that, MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,A)) is angle at C, which is angle ACB. And MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,A)) is angle at B, which is angle ABC. Therefore, angle at C is x, angle at B is 2x. Then total angles: 90 + x + 2x = 180 → 3x=90 → x=30. So answer C. 

But wait, why is the answer not 30? Let me check if there's something wrong here. Maybe I mixed up the angles? For example, could the angle measures be different?

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses different notation. Let me think again. The first predicate is RightAngle(Angle(B,A,C)), which is angle at A between BA and CA. So yes, right angle at A. Then, the measure of angle at C (angle BCA) is x, and measure of angle at B (angle ABC) is 2x. Thus, adding up gives 90 + x + 2x = 180 → 3x=90 → x=30. Therefore, answer C. 

So the correct answer should be C. 30. Hence, Final Answer: C.
