====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out the perimeter of this figure. So first, I need to visualize the points and lines given. Let me start by listing all the points and lines mentioned. 

Points are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. Then there are several lines connecting them. Let me note down each line:

Lines are:
- Line(D,C)
- Line(C,E)
- Line(E,H)
- Line(H,A)
- Line(A,F)
- Line(F,D)
- Line(F,G)
- Line(G,B)
- Line(B,A)

So these lines form some connected shapes. Also, there's a shaded quadrilateral mentioned as Quadrilateral(D,C,E,H,A,F). Wait, but quadrilaterals have four sides. Hmm, maybe that's a typo? Or perhaps it's a polygon with more sides? Because the points listed here are D, C, E, H, A, Fâ€”so six points. Maybe it's a hexagon? But the question says quadrilateral. That seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the shaded region is a combination of different polygons?

Alternatively, maybe the shaded area refers to a specific shape formed by those points. Let me try to sketch mentally. Starting from D connected to C, then C to E, E to H, H to A, A to F, F to D. So connecting D-C-E-H-A-F-D. That forms a hexagon. But the problem mentions a quadrilateral. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps the shaded region is part of the figure? Alternatively, maybe the quadrilateral is referring to another part of the figure. Wait, the shaded quadrilateral could be overlapping parts. Hmm, maybe I should focus on the perimeter regardless of shading since the perimeter would involve all outer edges.

But the question is about finding the perimeter of the entire figure. Let me think. The perimeter would be the sum of all the outer edges. However, some lines might be internal and not contribute to the perimeter. For example, if two lines connect to form a closed shape, they might share a side. Wait, but the problem lists all the lines, so maybe the entire figure is made up of these lines, and we need to find the total length around the perimeter. But how do the lines connect?

Let me try to map out the connections:

Starting with point D connected to C, then C to E, E to H, H to A, A to F, F to D. That makes a hexagon D-C-E-H-A-F-D. Additionally, there's Line(F,G), Line(G,B), Line(B,A). So F connects to G, G connects to B, and B connects back to A. So point B is connected to A via Line(B,A). So the full structure includes both the hexagon and the triangle F-G-B connected to A. Let me check again:

Wait, the lines are:

From earlier, Line(F,G), Line(G,B), Line(B,A). So F is connected to G, G to B, B to A. So the points F, G, B, and A are connected. Now, looking at other lines: Line(A,F) exists, so A is connected to F. Therefore, the figure has two separate components? Or is there overlap?

Wait, maybe the entire figure is connected. Let me see:

Starting from D connected to C, C to E, E to H, H to A, A to F, F to D (forming the hexagon). Then F is also connected to G, G to B, and B to A. So from A, we have connections to H and F and B. So B is connected to A and G. So the entire figure is connected through these lines. 

Now, to compute the perimeter, I need to consider all the outer edges. However, some lines may be shared between different parts. For instance, Line(A,F) is part of the hexagon and also part of the triangle F-G-B. But when calculating perimeter, we count each segment once if it's on the boundary.

Wait, but maybe the figure is a composite shape where some sides are internal. To avoid double-counting, I need to identify which segments are on the exterior.

Alternatively, perhaps the perimeter consists of all the outer edges without overlapping. Let me try to list all the line segments and check which ones are part of the perimeter.

First, list all the individual line segments:

1. D-C
2. C-E
3. E-H
4. H-A
5. A-F
6. F-D
7. F-G
8. G-B
9. B-A

Additionally, there's Line(B,A) already listed as #9. So these are all the segments. Now, to find the perimeter, we need to add up the lengths of the outer edges. But some of these segments might be internal. For example, if two segments meet at a point, but unless they form a closed loop, they might be part of the perimeter.

Wait, but the entire figure is connected. Let me imagine the shape. From D connected to C, then C-E, E-H, H-A, A-F, F-D forming a hexagon. Then F is connected to G, G to B, and B to A. So the points F, G, B, A form a triangle-like structure attached to the hexagon at point A.

But how does this affect the perimeter? Let me visualize:

The hexagon D-C-E-H-A-F-D. Each side of this hexagon is length 5, according to the given equals statements. Wait, the given LengthOf(Line(D,C)) = 5, same for Line(C,E), Line(E,H), Line(H,A), Line(F,B)=2, Line(F,A)=2, Line(G,B)=2. Wait, hold on. Let me check the equality statements again:

Given:

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,C)), 5)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,E)), 5)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,H)), 5)
- Equals(LengthOf(Lines(H,A)), 5)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,B)), 2)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,A)), 2)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(G,B)), 2)

Wait, so Line(D,C) is length 5, Line(C,E) is 5, Line(E,H) is 5, Line(H,A) is 5. Then Line(F,B) is 2, Line(F,A) is 2, Line(G,B) is 2. 

But what about Line(F,D)? Is that part of the given equalities? No. Similarly, Line(F,G) isn't specified. So maybe some of these lines have lengths that aren't directly given. Wait, but the problem states that the shaded quadrilateral is D,C,E,H,A,F. Wait, maybe that's a pentagon or hexagon? Since there are six points. But the problem says quadrilateral, which suggests four sides. Maybe there's a misinterpretation here. Alternatively, perhaps the shaded area is a specific part of the figure. 

But regardless, the perimeter calculation needs to take into account all the outer edges. Let me proceed step by step.

First, list all the line segments with their lengths:

Segments with known lengths:

- D-C: 5 units
- C-E: 5 units
- E-H: 5 units
- H-A: 5 units
- F-B: 2 units
- F-A: 2 units
- G-B: 2 units

Other segments like F-D, F-G, G-B, etc., but wait, Line(F,G) and Line(G,B) are given, but their lengths aren't specified. Wait, the problem gives the lengths for certain lines. For example, Line(F,A) is 2, Line(F,B) is 2, Line(G,B) is 2. What about Line(F,G)? Is that given? Not explicitly. Similarly, Line(D,F) is part of the hexagon, but its length isn't stated. Wait, the line from D to C is 5, C to E is 5, E to H is 5, H to A is 5. Then from A to F is 2, and from F to D is...? Wait, the line F-D is part of the hexagon, but its length isn't given. Wait, but the line F-D is connected. How long is that?

Wait, the problem gives LengthOf(Line(F,A)) = 2, which is from F to A. And Line(F,B) is 2. So from F to A is 2, and F to B is 2. Also, Line(G,B) is 2. So maybe the triangle FGB has sides FG, GB, BF, each of length 2? Wait, if F is connected to G, G to B, and B to F? No, because B is connected to A and G. Wait, the lines are F-G, G-B, and B-A. So F-G is one segment, G-B is another, and B-A is another. So the triangle F-G-B would require F to G, G to B, and B to F. But B to F is not directly connected. Unless there's another line. Wait, no. The lines are F-G, G-B, and B-A. There is no line from B to F, unless another line connects them. But according to the given lines, Line(B,A) is present, but Line(B,F) is not mentioned. So the triangle F-G-B is not a closed shape unless there's a connection between B and F. Wait, but B is connected to A, and F is connected to A. So B and F are connected via A? Not directly. So the segment from B to F is not part of the given lines. Hence, the triangle F-G-B is actually a path from F to G to B, but not a closed shape. So that's just two segments: F-G and G-B, each of length... Well, the length of F-G is not given, but the length of G-B is 2. Wait, the given equality is Equals(LengthOf(Line(G,B)), 2). So Line(G,B) is 2. But Line(F,G) isn't given. So we don't know its length yet. Same with Line(F,D), which is part of the hexagon. 

Hmm, this complicates things. How can I calculate the perimeter if some segments' lengths are unknown? Wait, but maybe there are relations between the segments. Let me think again.

Looking back at the lines:

The hexagon D-C-E-H-A-F-D. So the sides are DC=5, CE=5, EH=5, HA=5, AF=2, FD=?. Wait, FD is part of the hexagon. So FD is the last side. But we don't have its length given. However, maybe we can calculate it using coordinates or something? But without knowing angles or other lengths, it's hard. Wait, but maybe the figure is a regular shape? Let me check.

Wait, the given lengths are DC=5, CE=5, EH=5, HA=5, AF=2, FB=2, GB=2. So from D to C to E to H to A to F, then back to D. But FD is missing. Wait, but there's also the line from F to D. If we can find FD's length, that would help. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the figure is constructed such that certain triangles are equilateral or isoceles. For example, if the points are arranged such that certain triangles have equal sides. 

Wait, considering that AF is 2, and FB is 2. So from point A, there's a line to F (AF=2) and from F to B (FB=2). So triangle AFB has sides AF=2, FB=2, and AB. But we don't know AB's length. However, there's a line BA, which is part of the Line(B,A). So BA is connected. Wait, but BA's length isn't given. However, there's a line from B to A, which is part of the given lines. But we don't know its length. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the problem.

The question asks for the perimeter of the figure. The figure is composed of various lines, some of which have known lengths. The perimeter would consist of all the outer edges. However, some edges are internal and thus not part of the perimeter. For example, if two lines meet at a point, but are adjacent, they might form a straight line, making them internal. But without seeing the diagram, it's challenging. But maybe the figure is a star-shaped polygon or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire figure is made up of the hexagon D-C-E-H-A-F-D and the triangle F-G-B. But since the perimeter would exclude the internal edges. Wait, but how?

Let me try to outline all the line segments and see which are on the perimeter. The perimeter is the total distance around the outside of the figure. So any segment that is on the edge of the entire figure contributes to the perimeter.

Assuming that the figure is connected, the perimeter would include all the segments except those that are enclosed within the figure. But without a diagram, this is tricky. However, perhaps all the given lines are part of the perimeter, except for any overlapping ones.

Wait, but let's think: the lines are D-C, C-E, E-H, H-A, A-F, F-D (hexagon), plus F-G, G-B, B-A. So the hexagon has six sides, but some of those sides might be overlapped with others. For example, the line from A to F is part of the hexagon and also connected to F-G and F-B. So the segment AF is part of the perimeter. Then, from F, there's a segment to G, which is not part of the hexagon. Then from G to B, which is connected to B. Then from B to A, which is part of the original hexagon? No, because B is connected to A via Line(B,A), which is separate from the hexagon. So that would mean that the perimeter includes the segment B-A. So putting it together, the perimeter would be the sum of:

- D-C (5)
- C-E (5)
- E-H (5)
- H-A (5)
- A-F (2)
- F-G (?)
- G-B (2)
- B-A (?) 

But wait, what about the segment from F to D? That's part of the hexagon, so it's included. But what about the segment from F to D? Its length isn't given. But maybe we can derive it?

Wait, if the figure is connected, maybe there's a way to use coordinates. Let me attempt coordinate geometry.

Let me assign coordinates to points to model the figure. Start by placing point D at (0,0). Then, since DC is length 5, suppose we place point C at (5,0). Then CE is length 5. Assuming the figure is a series of connected lines, maybe forming a polygon. However, without knowing angles, it's difficult. Alternatively, maybe the figure is symmetric or follows a pattern.

Alternatively, since multiple sides are length 5, maybe the figure has several squares or rectangles. But the presence of varying lengths (like 2) complicates that.

Wait, but the shaded quadrilateral is mentioned. Even though the name is quadrilateral, the points listed are D, C, E, H, A, F â€” six points. Perhaps it's a typo and meant to say hexagon? Or maybe the shaded region is a specific part. If the shaded region is the hexagon D-C-E-H-A-F-D, then the perimeter would be the sum of its sides. But the hexagon has sides DC=5, CE=5, EH=5, HA=5, AF=2, FD=?. Wait, but FD is missing. If we can find FD, we can compute the perimeter. However, how?

Wait, there's another line from F to D. If I assume that the figure closes properly, the line FD must connect back to D. So the hexagon D-C-E-H-A-F-D. So FD is the sixth side. But its length isn't given. However, perhaps there's a relationship involving the other segments.

Looking at the other lines: F is connected to A (AF=2), and F is connected to G (FG=?), and G is connected to B (GB=2), and B is connected to A (BA=?). 

Is there a way to relate these? For example, if we consider triangle FAB? Points F, A, B. We know FA=2 and FB=2. So triangle FAB has two sides of length 2. If AB is the third side, but we don't know its length. However, there's a line BA, which is part of the given lines. So BA is connected, but its length isn't given. 

Alternatively, maybe the line from B to A is part of the hexagon? No, because the hexagon goes from H to A to F. So the line BA is separate. 

Wait, but if I consider the entire figure, including the lines from F to G to B to A, maybe there's a way to find the length of BA. For instance, if the line from B to A is part of a triangle with known sides. But we don't have enough info. 

Alternatively, maybe the figure has some symmetry. Suppose that the lines from F to G and G to B are both length 2, and F to B is also 2, forming an equilateral triangle FGB. If that were the case, then FG=GB=BF=2. But that would imply that the angle at G is 60 degrees, but without knowing angles, I can't confirm that. 

However, even if that's the case, how does that help with FD? 

Maybe there's a way to use the fact that the figure is closed. For example, starting at D, going through C, E, H, A, F, then back to D. This forms a closed loop. So the vector from D to C to E to H to A to F to D must close the loop. 

To calculate FD, we might need to use vectors or coordinate geometry. Let me try assigning coordinates again.

Start by setting D at (0,0). Assume DC is along the x-axis: C at (5,0). Then CE is length 5. Let's assume it goes upward, so E is at (5,5). Then EH is length 5; if we go left, H would be at (0,5). Then HA is length 5; from H(0,5) to A. If HA is horizontal, A would be at (5,5), but that would make HA from (0,5) to (5,5), which is length 5. Then A is at (5,5). Then AF is length 2. From A(5,5) to F. Where is F? Let's say it goes downward at some angle. Suppose AF is vertical down to F(5,5-2)=(5,3). Then FD would be from F(5,3) back to D(0,0). The distance between (5,3) and (0,0) is sqrt((5)^2 + (3)^2) = sqrt(34) â‰ˆ 5.83. But this is assuming a particular arrangement, which may not align with other lines. 

However, this is speculative. Also, there's the line from F to B, which is length 2. In my current setup, F is at (5,3). So from F(5,3), B is somewhere such that FB is length 2. Also, there's a line from G to B, which is length 2, and from F to G. 

This seems too vague without more constraints. Maybe there's another approach. 

Wait, the problem says to round to the nearest tenth if necessary. So maybe the perimeter is a whole number, and the unknown lengths cancel out? Let me think again.

The perimeter includes all the outer edges. Let's consider the hexagon D-C-E-H-A-F-D. If we assume that the sides DC, CE, EH, HA, AF are known (each 5,5,5,5,2), but FD is unknown. Then, the perimeter of the hexagon would be 5+5+5+5+2 + FD. But then there's also the triangle F-G-B, which adds FG + GB + BF. But GB is 2, BF is 2, and FG is unknown. 

But if the entire figure is considered, some of these segments might overlap. For example, if the segment FD is part of the hexagon, and the segment FB is part of the triangle, then the perimeter would include FD, AF, FB, BG, GF, and others. But without knowing FD and FG, how can we calculate the total perimeter?

Wait, but maybe FD and FG are connected in some way. For example, if F is connected to D and to G, but GD is not mentioned. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to find FD using the given data. 

Wait, the line from F to A is 2. In the hexagon, AF is one side. If we consider the triangle FAD? Wait, but we don't know DA or anything. 

Alternatively, maybe the figure has some congruent triangles. For example, if AF=2, FB=2, and GB=2, perhaps there are equilateral triangles involved. 

But without concrete information, this is guesswork. Let me try to look for another angle. 

The problem provides several equalities. Let's list them again:

- DC = 5
- CE = 5
- EH = 5
- HA = 5
- FB = 2
- FA = 2
- GB = 2

So, from the hexagon, four sides are 5, and one side AF is 2. The remaining side FD is unknown. From the other lines, FB=2, GB=2, and FA=2. 

If I consider the triangle FAB: FA=2, FB=2, and AB is unknown. If we can find AB, maybe it relates to other parts. 

Also, there's a line from B to A (BA), which is part of the given lines. So BA is a segment. If we can express BA in terms of other segments. 

But how? Without knowing angles or other lengths, it's hard. 

Wait, but maybe the perimeter is simply the sum of all given segments, assuming that all the unspecified segments are zero? No, that doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, perhaps the figure is made up of the hexagon and the triangle FGB, and the perimeter is the sum of all the outer edges. Let's assume that the segments not shared between the hexagon and the triangle are added. 

The hexagon has sides DC=5, CE=5, EH=5, HA=5, AF=2, FD=?. The triangle FGB has sides FG=?, GB=2, and FB=2. 

But if the figure is the union of the hexagon and the triangle, the perimeter would exclude the overlapping edges. However, if the triangle is attached at AF and FB, then the overlapping edges would be AF and FB. So the perimeter would be hexagon perimeter minus AF and FB, plus the perimeter of the triangle minus the overlapping edges. 

Wait, let's try that. 

Perimeter of hexagon: DC + CE + EH + HA + AF + FD = 5+5+5+5+2+FD = 22 + FD.

Perimeter of triangle FGB: FG + GB + BF = FG + 2 + 2 = FG + 4.

But if the triangle is attached to the hexagon at AF and FB, then those sides are internal. So total perimeter would be hexagon perimeter - AF - FB + triangle perimeter - FG - GB. Wait, no. When combining shapes, the overlapping edges are subtracted twice. Let me think carefully.

Original hexagon has AF as one of its sides. The triangle FGB shares FB and FG with the hexagon? No, the triangle FGB shares FB (from F to B) and possibly FG (from F to G). But the hexagon has AF (from A to F), and the triangle has FB (from F to B). So AF and FB are separate. 

Wait, the hexagon has AF as a side. The triangle FGB has FB as a side. These are separate. So when combining, the total perimeter would be the sum of all the hexagon's perimeter and the triangle's perimeter, minus twice the overlapping edges. But if there are no overlapping edges, then it's just the sum. 

But since the triangle is attached at F to B, and the hexagon has a side from F to A, and the triangle has a side from F to B, there is no overlapping. Thus, the total perimeter would be hexagon perimeter + triangle perimeter. 

But the hexagon perimeter is 5+5+5+5+2+FD = 22 + FD. Triangle perimeter is FG + 2 + 2 = FG + 4. Total perimeter would be 22 + FD + FG + 4 = 26 + FD + FG. 

But we still don't know FD and FG. 

Wait, but maybe there's a relation between FD and FG. For example, if there's a line from D to G, but it's not given. Alternatively, if the points are arranged in a way that FD and FG are parts of a larger structure. 

Alternatively, perhaps FD and FG are sides of a square or rectangle? 

This is getting too ambiguous. Maybe I'm missing something in the given predicates. Let me recheck.

Ah! Wait, the line from F to D is part of the hexagon. If we can find FD, maybe using the other lines. 

For example, if we consider the line from F to D, and other lines connected to F. From F, we have lines to A (AF=2), to G (FG=?), and to B (FB=2). So F is connected to three points: A, G, and B. 

If I consider triangle FAB: FA=2, FB=2, and AB is unknown. If I can find AB, maybe it helps. Also, there's a line from B to A, which is BA. 

But without knowing AB, it's still stuck. 

Wait, what if I consider the entire figure's closure? For instance, starting at D, moving through the hexagon to F, then from F to G to B to A, and back to D. But this is too vague. 

Wait, maybe the entire figure is a star or has intersecting lines. But without visualizing, it's hard to tell. 

Another idea: since multiple sides are length 5 and 2, maybe the perimeter is 5*4 + 2*3 = 20 + 6 = 26? But that assumes all unknown sides are 5 or 2. But that's a shot in the dark. 

Alternatively, if FD is 5, then the hexagon perimeter would be 5*4 + 2 + 5 = 27, and adding the triangle's perimeter (assuming FG is 2, making it 2+2+2=6), total perimeter 27+6=33, which is not among the options. 

But the answer choices are A. 20, B. 21, C. 24, D. 25. 

Wait, perhaps the perimeter is made up of the given lengths. Let me count all the given lengths:

DC=5, CE=5, EH=5, HA=5, FB=2, FA=2, GB=2. That's 5*4 + 2*3 = 20 + 6 = 26. But the options don't include 26. However, maybe some of the lines are counted twice or not. 

Wait, the perimeter might not include all of these. For example, if some lines are internal. Like, if the line from A to F is part of the perimeter, and the line from F to B is also part of the perimeter, but the line from B to A is part of the perimeter. So those three segments (AF, FB, BA) are part of the perimeter. 

But then, the hexagon's sides DC, CE, EH, HA, and FD. Plus the triangle's FG and GB. 

Wait, but if FD is not part of the perimeter, maybe it's internal. For example, if the line from F to D is inside the figure. But how? 

This is really confusing without seeing the actual diagram. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is to assume that all the given lengths are part of the perimeter, and the unknowns are zero? That seems unlikely. 

Alternatively, maybe the perimeter is the sum of all the given lengths, assuming that FD and FG are also 5 and 2 respectively. Let's try that. 

Suppose FD is 5 (since it's part of the hexagon, and other sides are 5). Then FD=5. Also, FG is part of the triangle FGB, which has GB=2 and FB=2. If FG is also 2, then the triangle is equilateral. So FG=2. 

Then total perimeter would be: DC=5, CE=5, EH=5, HA=5, AF=2, FD=5, FG=2, GB=2, and BA= ?. Wait, BA is part of the given lines. If BA is not given, but maybe it's part of the perimeter. 

Wait, but in this scenario, we've accounted for DC, CE, EH, HA, AF, FD, FG, GB. What about BA? It's not mentioned. 

If BA is part of the perimeter, but its length is not given, we can't include it. Unless it's derived from other lengths. 

Alternatively, if BA is part of the hexagon? No, because the hexagon goes from H to A to F. So BA is a separate segment. 

This is getting too tangled. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, maybe I should consider that the perimeter is the sum of all the given lengths, assuming FD and FG are 5 and 2 respectively. 

So sum would be: 5 (DC) + 5 (CE) + 5 (EH) + 5 (HA) + 2 (AF) + 5 (FD) + 2 (FG) + 2 (GB) + 2 (FB). Wait, but FB is already counted in FB=2. Wait, but FB is part of the triangle. Let me count:

- DC: 5
- CE: 5
- EH: 5
- HA: 5
- AF: 2
- FD: 5
- FG: 2
- GB: 2
- FB: 2

That totals to 5+5+5+5+2+5+2+2+2 = 33. Still not matching the options. 

Alternatively, maybe some of these segments are internal. For example, if AF is part of the hexagon and also part of the triangle, but it's counted once. So if I subtract duplicates. 

But without knowing which are duplicates, it's hard. 

Wait, the problem says "the perimeter of the figure". If the figure is the union of the hexagon and the triangle FGB, then the perimeter would be the sum of the hexagon's perimeter minus the overlapping edges plus the triangle's perimeter minus overlapping edges. 

Assume that the hexagon has perimeter DC + CE + EH + HA + AF + FD = 5+5+5+5+2+FD = 22 + FD. The triangle FGB has perimeter FG + GB + BF = FG + 2 + 2 = FG + 4. 

If the triangle is attached to the hexagon at point F, then the overlapping edges are AF (part of hexagon) and BF (part of triangle). Are these overlapping? No, AF is from A to F, and BF is from B to F. They meet at F but are separate. So no overlapping. Thus, total perimeter is 22 + FD + FG + 4 = 26 + FD + FG. 

But we still don't know FD and FG. 

Wait, but maybe FD and FG are both 2? If FD is 2, and FG is 2, then total perimeter is 26 + 2 + 2 = 30. Still not matching. 

Alternatively, if FD is 5, FG is 2, total perimeter is 26 + 5 + 2 = 33. 

This isn't working. 

Maybe the correct approach is to realize that the perimeter consists of all the given segments, assuming that all the lines are on the perimeter. Let's count the given lengths:

- DC=5
- CE=5
- EH=5
- HA=5
- AF=2

Total: 5*4 + 2*3 = 20 + 6 = 26. But none of the options is 26. The closest is B. 21 or C. 24. 

Wait, perhaps some of these segments are internal. For example, if the line from A to F is part of both the hexagon and the triangle, but it's only counted once. But in our count, AF is already counted once. 

Alternatively, if the perimeter excludes some segments. For example, if the line from B to A is internal. But how? 

Wait, if the line from B to A is part of the perimeter, then it's included. But if it's not, then it's excluded. 

Since we don't have information about BA's length, maybe it's not part of the perimeter. 

In that case, the total would be 5+5+5+5+2+2+2 = 26. Still not matching. 

Wait, the answer choices are A. 20, B. 21, C. 24, D. 25. 

Perhaps the correct answer is C. 24, assuming that some of the lengths are doubled or something. 

Alternatively, maybe the perimeter is 5*4 + 2*3 = 20 + 6 = 26, but rounded to the nearest tenth is 26.0, which is not an option. 

Wait, but the problem says "round to the nearest tenth if necessary." So maybe the actual perimeter is a decimal that rounds to one of the choices. 

But without knowing the exact lengths, it's impossible to calculate. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should revisit the initial assumption about the shaded quadrilateral. If the shaded quadrilateral is D, C, E, H, A, F, which is a hexagon, but maybe the perimeter is just the perimeter of the hexagon. 

If the hexagon has sides DC=5, CE=5, EH=5, HA=5, AF=2, and FD. If FD is 5, then perimeter is 5+5+5+5+2+5=27, which is not an option. If FD is 2, then 5+5+5+5+2+2=24, which is option C. 

Ah! Maybe FD is 2. Why? Because the line from F to D is part of the hexagon, and if the other sides are 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, then FD might be 2 to make the figure symmetrical. 

So assuming FD=2, then the perimeter of the hexagon is 5+5+5+5+2+2=24. That matches option C. 

But why would FD be 2? Because the line from F to A is 2, and maybe the line from F to D is also 2, creating a parallelogram or something. 

Alternatively, if the figure is a regular hexagon, but with some sides modified. 

Given that this leads to option C, which is 24, and the other options don't fit, I'll go with C.
