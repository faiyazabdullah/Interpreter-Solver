MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, the question is about finding the measure of angle 6, given that angle 1 is 50 degrees and angle 3 is 60 degrees. Hmm. First, I need to visualize or maybe sketch the diagram based on the given predicates. But since there's no actual diagram, I have to rely solely on the predicates provided.

Let me start by listing out all the given predicates again to make sure I don't miss anything. There are several lines mentioned: Line(j,k), Line(m,n), Line(p,q), Line(W,T), Line(B,D), Line(M,N). Then there are two triangles: Triangle(H,L,K) and Triangle(W,C,A). Also, some points lying on lines: PointLiesOnLine(H, Line(W,B)), PointLiesOnLine(L, Line(D,T)), PointLiesOnLine(Q, Line(J,P)). Then there are parallel and perpendicular relationships: Parallel(Line(j,k), Line(p,q)), Parallel(Line(m,n), Line(W,B)), Perpendicular(Line(H,L), Line(W,B)), Perpendicular(Line(W,B), Line(M,N)). Plus, RightAngle(Angle(C,H,P)) and RightAngle(Angle(L,M,K)).

Wait, but how do these relate to the angles mentioned in the question? The question refers to angles 1, 3, and 6. Since the problem mentions angles 1, 3, and 6, I need to figure out where they are located based on the given predicates. However, without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging. Maybe I should look for triangles or intersecting lines that could form those angles.

Starting with the triangles: Triangle(H,L,K) and Triangle(W,C,A). Let me note that. Also, there are several perpendicular lines. For example, Line(H,L) is perpendicular to Line(W,B), and Line(W,B) is also perpendicular to Line(M,N). That suggests that Line(W,B) is perpendicular to both Line(H,L) and Line(M,N), implying that Lines H,L and M,N are parallel to each other because they're both perpendicular to the same line. Wait, if two lines are both perpendicular to the same line, they must be parallel. So Line(H,L) || Line(M,N)? Or wait, no. Wait, Line(H,L) is perpendicular to Line(W,B), and Line(M,N) is also perpendicular to Line(W,B). Therefore, Line(H,L) and Line(M,N) are parallel to each other. Because if two lines are both perpendicular to the same line, they are parallel. So that gives us that H,L is parallel to M,N.

Also, there's a RightAngle at Angle(C,H,P) and Angle(L,M,K). So, Angle(C,H,P) is a right angle, meaning that lines CH and HP are perpendicular. Similarly, Angle(L,M,K) is a right angle, so LM and MK are perpendicular.

Now, looking at the lines: Line(W,B) is mentioned in several places. It's part of the triangle W,C,A, and there's a point H lying on Line(W,B). Also, Line(W,B) is parallel to Line(m,n). And Line(W,B) is perpendicular to Line(H,L) and Line(M,N).

So perhaps we can think of Line(W,B) as being vertical or horizontal, with other lines perpendicular or parallel to it. Let me try to imagine coordinates. Suppose Line(W,B) is horizontal. Then Line(H,L) would be vertical, and Line(M,N) would also be vertical, hence parallel to Line(H,L). 

But maybe I need to focus more on the angles given. The question says m∠1=50° and m∠3=60°, find m∠6. Without seeing the diagram, I need to deduce where these angles are. In typical problems, angles labeled 1, 3, 6 are likely in a figure with transversals and parallel lines, possibly involving triangles or quadrilaterals.

Given that there are parallel lines (like Line(m,n) || Line(W,B)), and perpendicular lines, maybe there's a transversal cutting through them, creating corresponding angles. Also, the presence of right angles in the triangles might indicate right triangles involved.

Another thing: The RightAngle(Angle(C,H,P)) implies that triangle CHP is a right triangle, with the right angle at H. Similarly, Angle(L,M,K) being a right angle means triangle LMK is a right triangle at M.

Now, considering the labels of the angles. Let me think. If ∠1 and ∠3 are given, and ∠6 is to be found, perhaps they are in a triangle or formed by intersecting lines. Let me consider that in such problems, sometimes angles in a triangle add up to 180°, or supplementary angles sum to 180°, or vertical angles are equal.

Alternatively, since there are parallel lines, maybe alternate interior angles or corresponding angles come into play. Also, since there are perpendicular lines, right angles are present, which might split angles into parts.

Wait, another thought: Given that Line(W,B) is parallel to Line(m,n), and Line(W,B) is perpendicular to Line(H,L) and Line(M,N). So if Line(W,B) is parallel to Line(m,n), then Line(m,n) is also perpendicular to Line(H,L) and Line(M,N). So maybe there are multiple perpendicular lines here.

Looking back at the triangles: Triangle(W,C,A) has a right angle at C,H,P? Wait, the RightAngle(Angle(C,H,P)) – so point H lies on Line(W,B), and point P is on Line(J,P) as per PointLiesOnLine(Q, Line(J,P))? Not sure yet. This seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe focusing on the fact that there are two right angles in the triangles. For instance, Triangle(W,C,A) has a right angle at C,H,P? Wait, the RightAngle(Angle(C,H,P)) – so the angle at point H between lines C-H and H-P is 90 degrees. So point H is connected to C and P, forming a right angle. Also, there's a Triangle(H,L,K), so H is connected to L and K.

Since H lies on Line(W,B), which is perpendicular to Line(H,L), that suggests that Line(H,L) is perpendicular to Line(W,B). So if Line(W,B) is horizontal, then Line(H,L) is vertical. So point H is somewhere on Line(W,B), and Line(H,L) goes vertically upwards from H. Then, since there's a right angle at H (from the RightAngle(Angle(C,H,P))), then lines HC and HP are perpendicular. So if Line(H,L) is vertical, then HC and HP would be horizontal? Wait, no. If Line(H,L) is vertical, and HC and HP are perpendicular to each other, then one of them would be horizontal. For example, if Line(H,L) is vertical, then HC could be horizontal, making HP vertical? Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Suppose Line(W,B) is horizontal. Then Line(H,L) is vertical (since it's perpendicular to Line(W,B)). At point H, there's a right angle between HC and HP. So if Line(H,L) is vertical, then HC and HP must be horizontal and vertical? Wait, but if Line(H,L) is vertical, then HP could be along Line(H,L), but that would make HC and HP either horizontal or something else. Maybe HC is horizontal, making HP vertical? No, because if Line(H,L) is vertical, and HP is another line from H, then HP could be horizontal. So if HC is horizontal and HP is vertical, then the angle between HC and HP is 90 degrees, which fits the right angle. So that would mean that HC is horizontal (same direction as Line(W,B)) and HP is vertical (same as Line(H,L)).

This is getting a bit tangled, but maybe focusing on the angles given. The problem states that angle 1 is 50°, angle 3 is 60°, and asks for angle 6. Assuming standard labeling, angles 1, 3, and 6 could be in different locations. For example, in a triangle or around a point.

Alternatively, since there are parallel lines and transversals, angles could be corresponding or alternate interior angles. Let's suppose that there's a transversal cutting through two parallel lines, creating angles that are related. For example, if two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal, alternate interior angles are equal, consecutive interior angles are supplementary.

But without knowing the exact positions, it's tricky. Another possibility: Since there are right angles, maybe some of the angles given are complementary or supplementary to others.

Wait, let me consider that angle 1 and angle 3 are in a triangle. If angle 1 is 50°, angle 3 is 60°, then the third angle would be 70°, since angles in a triangle sum to 180°. But then angle 6 could be that third angle, leading to 70°, which is option C. Alternatively, if they are adjacent angles forming a linear pair, but that would depend on their positions.

Alternatively, if angle 1 and angle 3 are part of a larger structure. For example, if there are two intersecting lines creating vertical angles, and angle 1 and 3 are vertical angles, but then they'd be equal. But here, they are 50° and 60°, so that's not the case. Hence, they are probably not vertical angles.

Another approach: Since there are several right angles, maybe the angles given are part of triangles or other polygons. For instance, if angle 1 and angle 3 are in a triangle, their sum plus angle 6 equals 180°, but that depends on their positions.

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 and angle 3 are remote interior angles relative to angle 6, which could be an exterior angle. In that case, angle 6 would be the sum of angles 1 and 3. But 50 + 60 = 110°, which isn't among the options. Unless there's another relationship.

Wait, the answer choices are 50, 60, 70, 80. If angle 6 is supplementary to the sum of angles 1 and 3, then 180 - (50+60) = 70, which is option C. That seems plausible. But why would angle 6 be supplementary?

Alternatively, maybe angle 6 is part of a triangle where angles 1 and 3 are other angles. For example, if angle 1 and angle 3 are two angles in a triangle, then angle 6 would be the third. But 180 - 50 - 60 = 70. So that would give 70°, which is option C. That seems like a strong candidate.

But how do I know that angles 1 and 3 are in the same triangle as angle 6? Well, without the diagram, this is speculative. But given that the answer options include 70, which is the difference between 180 and 50+60, and the fact that angles in a triangle sum to 180, this might be the intended path.

Another way: Since there are right angles in the figure, maybe angle 6 is formed by combining angles from different parts. For instance, if angle 6 is an external angle to a triangle with angles 1 and 3, then it would be 50 + 60 = 110, which doesn't fit. But if there's a straight line, making angle 6 supplementary to the sum of angles 1 and 3, then 180 - (50+60) = 70. 

Alternatively, if angle 1 and angle 3 are adjacent angles forming a larger angle, and angle 6 is the remaining part. But again, without knowing their positions, it's hard to say. However, given the answer choices and common geometric problems, 70° seems likely. So I'll go with option C.
