MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, C, D, E, F, and a circle C. Some points lie on the circle, like A, B, C, D. Then there are lines: AD and CB intersect at some point, maybe E? Wait, looking back at the predicates, there's a Line(A,D) and Line(C,B), and their intersection is mentioned. Also, there are several length equalities involving E. Let me parse all the given info carefully.

First, the points A, B, C, D are all on the same circle C. That means they're concyclic, so maybe forming a cyclic quadrilateral? But since they're all on a circle, perhaps ABCD is a quadrilateral inscribed in the circle. However, there's also a point E involved. 

Looking at the lines: Line(A,D) and Line(C,B) intersect. Let me note that. So, if I imagine points A and D connected by a line, and points C and B connected by another line, these two lines intersect at some point. Wait, but where is E here? Because in the predicates, there's a mention of LengthOf(Line(A,E)) equals x, LengthOf(Line(E,D)) is 4, LengthOf(Line(C,E)) is 3, and LengthOf(Line(E,B)) is 6. So E must be the intersection point of lines AD and CB. Because those lines intersect, and E is a point such that it connects to A, D, C, B with given lengths. 

So, E is the intersection point of AD and CB. Therefore, E lies somewhere inside the circle or outside? Since A, B, C, D are on the circle, but E is formed by the intersection of two chords? Or secants?

Wait, if E is the intersection of AD and CB, then depending on whether the lines are extended or not. For example, if AD and CB are chords of the circle, their intersection could be inside or outside the circle. But since E has segments connecting to A, D, C, B, maybe E is inside the circle. Let's assume that for now.

Now, the given lengths are:

- AE = x (since LengthOf(Line(A,E)) = x)
- ED = 4
- CE = 3
- EB = 6

So, along line AD, we have AE + ED = AD, so AD = x + 4. Along line CB, we have CE + EB = CB, so CB = 3 + 6 = 9.

But how do these relate? Maybe using power of a point? Since E is the intersection of two chords AD and CB in the circle. Power of a point theorem says that for two chords intersecting at E, the products of the segments are equal. That is, AE * ED = CE * EB. Wait, yes! That's the key here.

Let me recall the power of a point theorem: if two chords intersect at E, then AE * ED = CE * EB. So substituting the given values:

AE * ED = CE * EB  
x * 4 = 3 * 6  
4x = 18  
x = 18 / 4 = 4.5

Wait, but 4.5 isn't one of the answer choices. The options are 2, 3, 4, 6. Hmm, did I make a mistake here?

Wait, let me check again. The power of a point theorem states that for two chords intersecting at E, the product of the lengths of the segments of one chord equals the product of the lengths of the segments of the other chord. So yes, AE * ED should equal CE * EB. Given that, plugging in the numbers:

AE is x, ED is 4, CE is 3, EB is 6. So x*4 = 3*6 → 4x=18 → x=4.5. But that's not among the choices. That suggests either my understanding is wrong, or perhaps there's a miscalculation.

Alternatively, maybe E is not inside the circle? If E were outside the circle, then the power of a point would be different. Wait, if E is outside the circle, then the power of point E would be equal to EA * ED = EC * EB. Wait, but if E is outside, then the formula is EA * ED = EC * EB, but EA and ED would be parts of a secant. Wait, but in that case, if E is outside, then EA and ED would be the entire secant, but in our case, since E is the intersection of AD and CB, if E is outside, then AD and CB are secants passing through E. However, since points A and D are on the circle, and if E is outside, then EA would be the external segment, and ED would be the internal part. Wait, but the standard formula for power of a point outside is (EA)(ED) = (EC)(EB). But in that case, EA would be the whole secant from E through A to D, so EA is the distance from E to A, and ED is from E to D. Wait, but that depends on the position. Let me clarify.

Suppose E is outside the circle. Then, for a secant passing through E and intersecting the circle at A and D, the power would be EA * ED, where EA is the length from E to A, and ED is from E to D. But if E is outside, then EA would be longer than ED if A is closer to E. Wait, actually, the formula is that for a secant from E passing through A and D, the power is EA * ED, where EA is the entire length from E to D, but wait no—actually, if E is outside, and the secant passes through E, then goes through A first, then D. So the power would be EA * ED, but actually, the formula is (distance from E to A) multiplied by (distance from E to D). Wait, no—if the secant starts at E, goes through A, then exits at D, then the power is EA * ED. But if E is outside, then EA is the entire length from E to A, and ED is from E to D. Wait, no—that’s not correct. The correct formula is that if a secant from E passes through the circle at X and Y, then EX * EY = power of E. So if the secant passes through E, then goes to X, then Y, then EX * EY. So in our case, for line AD, if E is outside, then the points would be ordered as E-A-D or E-D-A. Similarly for line CB.

But in our case, since A and D are points on the circle, and E is the intersection of AD and CB. If E is outside, then for line AD, the order would be E-A-D or E-D-A. Similarly for CB. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say. However, given the lengths, let's see.

Assuming E is inside the circle, then the power of point E would be AE * ED = CE * EB. Which gives us 4x = 18 → x = 4.5. Not matching the choices. But if E is outside, then the formula would be EA * ED = EC * EB. Wait, but if E is outside, then for line AD, the power would be EA * ED, where EA is the length from E to A, and ED is from E to D. Wait, but if E is outside, then EA would be the entire length from E to A, and ED would be from E to D. But if the line AD passes through E, then E is outside, so the points would be arranged as E---A---D or E---D---A. Depending on which direction. Suppose E is outside, and the line AD extends beyond A and D. Wait, but since A and D are on the circle, if E is outside, then the line AD is a secant, and E is outside. Then the power of point E would be EA * ED, where EA is the distance from E to A, and ED is from E to D. Wait, but in reality, the formula is that if a secant passes through E and intersects the circle at X and Y, then EX * EY = power. So if E is outside, and the secant passes through E, then goes through A and D, then EX * EY would be EA * ED, assuming that E is outside, and the points are ordered as E-A-D. In that case, EA is the length from E to A, and ED is from E to D, so the product is EA * ED. But if the line AD is extended beyond A to E, then EA is the distance from E to A, and ED would be EA + AD. Wait, no, if E is outside, then the points would be E---A---D, so that ED = EA + AD. But in our case, the problem gives us AE = x and ED = 4. So if E is outside, then ED would be the entire length from E to D, which would be EA + AD if A is between E and D. Wait, but in that case, ED = EA + AD. But we don't know AD. Alternatively, if the points are ordered E---D---A, then ED is from E to D, and DA is from D to A, so EA would be ED + DA. But in the problem, they give ED = 4, and AE = x. So if E is outside, then depending on the order, EA could be ED + something or vice versa.

This seems complicated. But given that the answer choices don't include 4.5, perhaps there's an error in assuming E is inside. Let me re-examine the problem.

Wait, the problem mentions PointLiesOnCircle(A, Circle(C)), so A is on the circle. Similarly for B, C, D. So all four points A, B, C, D lie on the same circle. Now, lines AD and CB intersect at E. So if lines AD and CB intersect at E, then E can be inside or outside the circle. But since A, B, C, D are on the circle, if lines AD and CB intersect inside the circle, then E is inside; otherwise, outside.

But according to the given lengths, if E is inside, then AE * ED = CE * EB, leading to x * 4 = 3 * 6 ⇒ x = 18/4 = 4.5, which is not an option. Hence, maybe E is outside. Let's consider that scenario.

If E is outside the circle, then the power of point E with respect to the circle is equal to EA * ED = EC * EB. But in this case, EA and ED are parts of the secant lines. Wait, if E is outside, then for line AD, which passes through E, the points would be E, then A, then D (assuming E is outside and the line AD is extended beyond A to E). Wait, but in that case, the power of point E would be EA * ED, where EA is the distance from E to A, and ED is from E to D. But since D is on the circle, and A is also on the circle, then ED would be EA + AD. Wait, but if E is outside, then the length from E to D would be EA + AD, because A is between E and D. So ED = EA + AD. But in this case, the problem gives ED = 4. So if ED = EA + AD, but we don't know AD. Alternatively, if the points are ordered E, D, A, then ED is the distance from E to D, and EA is ED + DA. But again, without knowing DA, this complicates things.

Alternatively, maybe the power of a point formula applies as follows: If two secants pass through E, then EA * ED = EC * EB. Wait, but if E is outside, then each secant would have two intersection points. For example, line AD passes through E and intersects the circle at A and D, so the power is EA * ED. Similarly, line CB passes through E and intersects the circle at C and B, so the power is EC * EB. Since E is outside, these two powers are equal. Thus, EA * ED = EC * EB. So even if E is outside, the equation holds. So regardless of E being inside or outside, the formula is EA * ED = EC * EB. Wait, no—the formula is different. If E is inside, then it's AE * ED = CE * EB. If E is outside, it's EA * ED = EC * EB. Wait, no. Wait, the general power of a point formula is:

If E is outside, then for a secant passing through E and intersecting the circle at X and Y, then EX * EY = power.

If E is inside, then for two chords intersecting at E, then EX * EY = power (which is negative, but in absolute terms, the product is equal).

So regardless of whether E is inside or outside, the equality EA * ED = EC * EB holds. So why does the calculation give x=4.5, which isn't an option?

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in how the lengths are assigned. Let me double-check the given predicates.

The problem states:

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,E)), x)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,D)), 4)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,E)), 3)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,B)), 6)

So, for line AD, the points are A and D. The line AD passes through E. So, depending on the order, E could be between A and D, making AE and ED segments adding up to AD. Or E could be outside, making AE and ED parts of the same line but extending beyond. However, the way the lengths are given, we need to consider the actual segments.

For instance, if E is between A and D, then AE + ED = AD. And the power of point E would be AE * ED = CE * EB. So in this case, substituting:

AE = x, ED = 4 → x * 4 = 3 * 6 → 4x = 18 → x = 4.5. Still not matching the options.

But since the answer choices are integers, this suggests that perhaps the assumption about the configuration is incorrect. Maybe E is not between A and D, but in another arrangement.

Wait, what if the line AD is extended beyond D to E, so that ED is part of the line, and AE is longer? For example, if E is beyond D, then AE = AD + DE. But then the length of Line(A,E) would be AD + DE. However, the problem states that LengthOf(Line(E,D)) is 4. So if E is beyond D, then ED = 4, and AE = AD + 4. But we don't know AD. However, the power of point E would still be EA * ED = EC * EB. Wait, but if E is outside, then the formula is EA * ED = EC * EB. But if E is beyond D, then EA would be the length from E to A, which is ED + DA. So EA = ED + DA, but DA is the diameter or something? No, unless we can find DA from elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe there's a misinterpretation of which segments correspond to which lengths. Let me think again.

Suppose E is the intersection of AD and CB. So, if I imagine lines AD and CB crossing at E. Now, depending on the positions of A, B, C, D on the circle, E could be inside or outside. But given the lengths, perhaps we can use coordinate geometry to model this?

Let me try assigning coordinates. Let's place the circle as the unit circle for simplicity, but maybe that's too vague. Alternatively, consider coordinates where E is at origin.

Let me suppose E is at (0,0). Let me assign coordinates such that:

Line AD passes through E. Let me assume that A and D are points on the circle, and E is the intersection of AD and CB. So, suppose line AD passes through E, with E lying between A and D. Then, AE = x, ED = 4. So total length AD = x + 4.

Similarly, line CB passes through E, with CE = 3 and EB = 6. So total length CB = 3 + 6 = 9.

Since A, B, C, D are on the circle, perhaps we can use power of a point. But earlier calculation gives x=4.5, which is not an option. This suggests that perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, but the answer choices include 4. Maybe I made a mistake in applying the theorem. Let me recheck the power of a point theorem.

Power of a point theorem: If two chords intersect at E, then AE * ED = BE * EC. Wait, no, it's AE * ED = CE * EB. Yes, that's correct. So AE * ED = CE * EB. So with AE=x, ED=4, CE=3, EB=6. So x*4=3*6 → x=18/4=4.5. Not matching the options. So either there's a mistake in the problem setup, or I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the problem involves triangles and Pythagoras? Let me think. Are there any right angles? Or maybe triangle similarities?

Alternatively, perhaps E is not the intersection of AD and CB, but some other construction? Let me check the original predicates again.

Original predicates:

- Line(A,D)
- Line(C,B)
- IntersectionOf(Line(A,D), Line(C,B))

Ah! The intersection of lines AD and CB is a point, which is presumably E. But the problem mentions Point(E) in the predicates? Wait, looking back at the list of predicates, the points are A, B, C, D, E, F. So E is a point. So the intersection point of AD and CB is E. So E is defined as the intersection point. Therefore, the previous analysis holds.

But the problem is that the calculation leads to x=4.5, which is not an option. So there must be a different interpretation. Let me re-express the given data.

Given:

- Points A, B, C, D are on circle C.
- Lines AD and CB intersect at E.
- Length AE = x
- Length ED = 4
- Length CE = 3
- Length EB = 6

So, if I use power of a point, AE * ED = CE * EB → x*4 = 3*6 → x = 18/4 = 4.5. Not an option. So why is this happening?

Wait, could there be a typo in the problem? Or perhaps I've misread the lengths. Let me recheck:

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,E)), x): So AE = x
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,D)), 4): ED = 4
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,E)), 3): CE = 3
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,B)), 6): EB = 6

Yes, that's correct. So the calculation is correct. But none of the options match 4.5. Therefore, there must be an alternative approach.

Wait, perhaps E is not the intersection of AD and CB, but rather some other relation? Or maybe the lines AD and CB are not chords but secants, and E is outside? Let me try again with E outside.

If E is outside the circle, then the power of point E is equal to EA * ED = EC * EB. So again, x * 4 = 3 * 6 → x=4.5. Same result. Still no good.

Hmm. Is there any other possibility? What if the lines AD and CB are not straight lines but something else? No, the predicate says Line(A,D) and Line(C,B), so they are straight lines.

Wait, could the lengths be referring to vectors instead of scalar distances? Like directed lengths? For example, if E is between A and D, then AE and ED would have opposite signs, but the product would be negative. But the problem says Equals(LengthOf(...)), which implies positive lengths. So that doesn't change anything.

Another thought: Perhaps the points are not in the order assumed. For example, maybe E is not between A and D, but in another position. Suppose that on line AD, the points are ordered as A-E-D, so that AE = x and ED = 4. Then, the full length AD = AE + ED = x + 4. Similarly, on line CB, if the points are ordered as C-E-B, then CE = 3 and EB = 6, so CB = 3 + 6 = 9. This is the same as before, leading to x=4.5.

Alternatively, what if on line AD, the points are ordered as D-E-A, so that ED = 4 and AE = x. Then, the full length DA = DE + EA = 4 + x. But the power of point E would still be AE * ED = x * 4. Same equation.

No difference.

Wait, what if the lines AD and CB are not chords, but secants passing through E, and E is outside the circle? Then, for line AD, the power is EA * ED = (EA)(ED), where EA is the length from E to A, and ED is from E to D. But if E is outside, then the points could be arranged as E-A-D, with E outside, A and D on the circle. Then, EA is the distance from E to A, and ED is from E to D, which would be EA + AD. Wait, but AD is the length between A and D on the circle. However, we don't know AD. So this introduces more variables.

But if we use the power of point formula, it still holds: EA * ED = EC * EB. So even if E is outside, the same formula applies. But without knowing AD or other lengths, we cannot proceed. Unless there is another relationship.

Wait, maybe the fact that A, B, C, D are on the circle allows us to use some other property. For example, triangle similarity or something else?

Let me think about triangle CEB and triangle DEA. Are they similar? Or maybe triangle AEC and BED?

Wait, since A, B, C, D are on a circle, maybe there are cyclic quadrilaterals or inscribed angles. But I'm not sure how to connect that with the given lengths.

Alternatively, maybe using Stewart's theorem or Menelaus' theorem?

Stewart's theorem relates the lengths of sides of a triangle with a cevian. But without knowing the full lengths, it's unclear.

Wait, but if I consider triangle EAD and triangle ECB, or something like that.

Alternatively, considering coordinates. Let me try setting up coordinates.

Let me assume E is at (0,0). Let me set coordinates such that:

- Point E is at (0,0).
- Line AD passes through E. Let me assume line AD is the x-axis. Let me define point A at (-a, 0), point D at (d, 0), so that E is between them. Then AE = distance from E to A is a, and ED = distance from E to D is d. According to the problem, ED = 4, so d = 4. AE = x = a. So a = x, d = 4.

Then, line CB passes through E. Let me choose coordinates for line CB. Let me assume it's the y-axis for simplicity. Let me define point C at (0, c) and point B at (0, b), so that E is between them. Then CE = distance from E to C is |c|, and EB = distance from E to B is |b|. According to the problem, CE = 3, so |c|=3, and EB = 6, so |b|=6. Assuming the points are placed such that C is above E and B is below, or vice versa. Let's say C is at (0, 3) and B is at (0, -6), so that CE = 3 and EB = 6.

Now, points A(-x, 0), D(4, 0), C(0, 3), B(0, -6) are on the same circle. We need to find x such that all four points lie on a circle.

To find the condition that these four points lie on a circle, we can use the general equation of a circle: x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0. Plugging in the coordinates of the four points.

For point A(-x, 0):
(-x)^2 + 0^2 + D*(-x) + E*0 + F = 0 → x² - Dx + F = 0. (Equation 1)

For point D(4, 0):
4² + 0^2 + D*4 + E*0 + F = 0 → 16 + 4D + F = 0. (Equation 2)

For point C(0, 3):
0^2 + 3^2 + D*0 + E*3 + F = 0 → 9 + 3E + F = 0. (Equation 3)

For point B(0, -6):
0^2 + (-6)^2 + D*0 + E*(-6) + F = 0 → 36 - 6E + F = 0. (Equation 4)

Now, we have four equations:

1) x² - Dx + F = 0  
2) 16 + 4D + F = 0  
3) 9 + 3E + F = 0  
4) 36 - 6E + F = 0  

We can solve equations 3 and 4 for E and F.

Subtract equation 3 from equation 4:

(36 - 6E + F) - (9 + 3E + F) = 0 - 0  
36 - 6E + F - 9 - 3E - F = 0  
27 - 9E = 0 → 9E = 27 → E = 3.

Plugging E = 3 into equation 3:

9 + 3*3 + F = 0 → 9 + 9 + F = 0 → F = -18.

Now, substitute F = -18 into equation 2:

16 + 4D - 18 = 0 → 4D - 2 = 0 → 4D = 2 → D = 0.5.

Now, from equation 1: x² - Dx + F = 0 → x² - 0.5x -18 = 0.

Solving for x:

x² - 0.5x - 18 = 0 → multiply by 2: 2x² - x - 36 = 0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [1 ± √(1 + 288)] / 4 = [1 ± √289]/4 = [1 ± 17]/4.

Positive root: (1 + 17)/4 = 18/4 = 4.5. Negative root: (1 - 17)/4 = -16/4 = -4. Since x represents a length, it must be positive. So x = 4.5. Again, same result. Which is not an option. So this confirms that x=4.5 is correct under this configuration. But the answer choices don't include 4.5. So there's a contradiction.

This suggests that either the problem has a typo, or there's a different interpretation. Let me check the problem statement again for any missed details.

Wait, the problem lists Point(F) as well, but it's not used in any of the predicates. Maybe F is a red herring or part of another condition not mentioned. Or perhaps there's a misprint and one of the lengths was meant to be different. For example, if EB was 4 instead of 6, then x would be 3. But that's speculation.

Alternatively, maybe the lengths are not directly AE, ED, CE, EB, but something else. Let me re-read the predicates.

The given equals are:

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,E)), x)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,D)), 4)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,E)), 3)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,B)), 6)

So, the lengths are indeed AE = x, ED = 4, CE = 3, EB = 6. So no issue there.

Wait, but maybe the line CB is not the line connecting C to B, but something else? No, the predicate says Line(C,B), which is the line connecting C and B.

Another possibility: Maybe the points are not in the order assumed. For example, maybe E is not between A and D, but on the extension of AD beyond A, making ED = AE + AD. Let me explore this scenario.

If E is on the extension of AD beyond A, then the points are ordered E-A-D. So, AE is the length from E to A, and ED is from E to D. So ED = EA + AD. But we don't know AD. However, the power of point E would be EA * ED = EC * EB. Substituting:

EA = x, ED = 4 → but ED = EA + AD → 4 = x + AD → AD = 4 - x.

But we also have line CB passing through E. If E is on the extension of AD, then line CB passes through E, and CE = 3, EB = 6. So, similarly, if E is on the extension of CB beyond C, then CB = CE + EB = 3 + 6 = 9. But how does this help?

But without knowing AD or CB, we can't relate them directly. However, since A, B, C, D are on the circle, maybe there's a relation between AD and CB via the circle's properties. For example, if AD and CB are chords, then their lengths relate to the circle's radius and central angles. But without knowing the radius or angles, this is difficult.

Alternatively, since we've already tried the power of a point and it leads to x=4.5, and this is confirmed by coordinate geometry, perhaps the answer is supposed to be 4.5, but it's not an option. This suggests that there might be an error in the problem or in the answer choices.

However, since this is a multiple-choice question, and the options are A. 2, B. 3, C. 4, D. 6, perhaps there's a miscalculation. Let me check once more.

Wait, maybe the power of a point formula is AE * ED = CE * EB, but I mixed up the segments. Let me confirm the theorem.

Yes, the power of a point E inside the circle is AE * ED = CE * EB, where AE and ED are the segments of one chord, and CE and EB are the segments of another chord. So the calculation is correct.

But if x=4.5 is not an option, perhaps the intended answer is 4, and there's a rounding or approximation? Or perhaps the problem assumes integer values and expects us to round down? But that's speculative.

Alternatively, maybe there's a misread in the problem. For example, if the length of Line(E,D) is 6 instead of 4, or something like that. But without further info, it's impossible to tell.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves triangle area or something else. Let me think: if we consider triangle CEB and AED, or use coordinates to find relations.

Wait, in the coordinate system I set up earlier, we found x=4.5. But maybe there's a constraint I missed. For example, the points A, B, C, D must lie on the same circle. In the coordinate setup, we derived x=4.5, but perhaps there's another condition that requires x to be an integer? Or maybe I made a mistake in the coordinate setup.

Wait, in the coordinate setup, we had points A(-4.5, 0), D(4, 0), C(0, 3), B(0, -6). Let's verify if these four points lie on the same circle.

From earlier, the circle equation was x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0, with D=0.5, E=3, F=-18.

So the equation is x² + y² + 0.5x + 3y - 18 = 0.

Check for point A(-4.5, 0):

(-4.5)^2 + 0^2 + 0.5*(-4.5) -18 = 20.25 - 2.25 -18 = 0. Correct.

Point D(4, 0): 16 + 0 + 0.5*4 -18 = 16 + 2 - 18 = 0. Correct.

Point C(0, 3): 0 + 9 + 0 + 3*3 -18 = 9 + 9 -18 = 0. Correct.

Point B(0, -6): 0 + 36 + 0 + 3*(-6) -18 = 36 - 18 -18 = 0. Correct.

All points satisfy the circle equation, confirming x=4.5 is correct. But since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is C. 4, assuming that the problem expects rounding or a different interpretation. Or perhaps there's a mistake in the problem.

Alternatively, maybe the question asks for something else, like the length of AE, but due to a miscalculation, it's expected to pick 4.5 ≈ 4.5, but the closest option is C. 4. But that's not rigorous.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses vector magnitudes or something else. But I can't think of another approach.

Given that all methods lead to x=4.5, and the options don't include it, I might conclude that there's an error in the problem. But since this is a multiple-choice question, and assuming that the correct answer is among the options, perhaps the intended answer is C. 4, and there's a mistake in the problem's setup or the answer choices.

Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the power of a point theorem. Let me check another source.

According to the power of a point theorem, if two chords intersect at E, then AE * ED = CE * EB. This is correct. So if AE=4.5, ED=4, CE=3, EB=6, then 4.5*4=18, 3*6=18. It checks out.

But since this is not an option, perhaps the correct answer is C. 4, and the problem had a typo, such as ED=3 instead of 4, or EB=4 instead of 6. For example, if ED=3 and EB=6, then x*3=3*6 → x=6, which is option D. Or if ED=4 and EB=4, x*4=3*4 → x=3, option B. Or if ED=3 and EB=4, x*3=3*4 → x=4, option C.

Given that option C is 4, and if there's a typo in the problem, maybe the intended answer is C. 4. But without knowing the exact correction, it's hard to say. However, since the calculation consistently shows x=4.5, and the closest option is C. 4, perhaps the intended answer is C.

But this is speculative. Alternatively, maybe the problem considers only integer values, and the correct answer is C. 4, assuming that the calculation is x=4.5, but rounded down to 4.

In the absence of further information, and given the options, the closest possible choice is C. 4. Hence, I'll select C as the answer.
