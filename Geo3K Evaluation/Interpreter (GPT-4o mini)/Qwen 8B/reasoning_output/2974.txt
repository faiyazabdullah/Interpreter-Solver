MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have points P, Q, R, S forming a rhombus inscribed in a circle. The question asks for the measure of arc SP, denoted as m∠SP. Wait, actually, the notation m∠SP might be a bit confusing. Wait, maybe it's the measure of the arc SP? Because usually, the measure of an arc is denoted with a caret, like m̂SP. But since the user wrote m \widehat S P, I think they mean the measure of arc SP. 

First, let me recall some properties. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal. Also, if a quadrilateral is inscribed in a circle, it's called a cyclic quadrilateral. However, not all rhombuses are cyclic unless they meet certain conditions. Wait, but here it's stated that PQRST... wait, no, the points are P, Q, R, S forming a rhombus inscribed in a circle. So, that means the rhombus is cyclic. But wait, a rhombus has opposite angles equal and adjacent angles supplementary. For a quadrilateral to be cyclic, the sum of each pair of opposite angles must be 180 degrees. Therefore, in a rhombus, since opposite angles are equal, each pair would need to add up to 180. That implies that each angle must be 90 degrees. Wait, so if a rhombus is cyclic, then it must be a square? Because only squares (and rectangles) are cyclic rhombuses. Wait, because in a rhombus, if it's cyclic, then all angles are 90 degrees, making it a square. But the problem says it's a rhombus, not necessarily a square. Hmm, there's something conflicting here. Let me check again.

Wait, a rhombus has all sides equal, but its angles can vary. For a quadrilateral to be cyclic, the sum of opposite angles must be 180 degrees. In a rhombus, opposite angles are equal. So, if angle A equals angle C, and angle B equals angle D, then angle A + angle C = 2*angle A = 180°, so angle A = 90°. Similarly, angle B = 90°. Therefore, all angles are 90°, making the rhombus a square. Therefore, the only rhombus that can be inscribed in a circle is a square. So, in this case, the figure is a square inscribed in a circle. But the problem refers to it as a rhombus, which could imply that it's a square. So, maybe the problem is referring to a square as a special case of a rhombus. 

But wait, the problem mentions points P, Q, R, S connected as a rhombus. Let me think about how the points are arranged. Since it's a rhombus, the order of the points matters. The lines given are Line(P,Q), Line(Q,R), Line(R,S), Line(S,P). So, connecting P-Q-R-S-P forms the rhombus. Now, since it's inscribed in a circle, all four vertices lie on the circumference of the circle. 

Now, the question is asking for the measure of arc SP. Let me visualize this. In a square inscribed in a circle, each side subtends an arc. Since the square has four equal arcs, each arc would be 90 degrees. But wait, if the square is inscribed in the circle, then each arc between two consecutive vertices is 90 degrees. So, for example, arc PQ would be 90°, arc QR would be 90°, etc. But the question is asking for arc SP. Wait, starting at point S and going to point P. Depending on the direction of the arc, but typically, arcs are considered as the smaller arc unless specified otherwise. 

Wait, but in a square, moving from S to P would be three edges away? Wait, no. Let me imagine labeling the square clockwise as P, Q, R, S. Then, the order would be P connected to Q, Q to R, R to S, S back to P. So, the square is labeled in order. Then, the arcs between each consecutive pair are 90°. So, arc SP would be the arc from S to P, which skips one vertex. Wait, but in a square, moving from S to P would be either the arc passing through Q or R? Wait, no. If the square is labeled P, Q, R, S in order around the circle, then the arcs between them are each 90°. So, arc SP would go from S to P, which is adjacent in the square? No, S is connected to R and P. Wait, in the square, each vertex connects to the next. So, the order is P-Q-R-S-P. So, the arcs between each pair of consecutive points are 90°, so arc PQ, arc QR, arc RS, arc SP. Each of those arcs is 90°, since the total circumference is 360°, divided by four arcs. So, each arc is 90°, so arc SP is 90°, making the measure m∠SP equal to 90°, which would correspond to answer D. 

Wait, but hold on. Maybe the problem isn't assuming a square? Wait, earlier reasoning said that if a rhombus is cyclic, it must be a square. But perhaps the problem allows for other cases? Let me double-check that logic. 

In general, a rhombus has all sides equal. If it's cyclic, then it must satisfy that the sum of opposite angles is 180°. Since in a rhombus, opposite angles are equal, then each pair of opposite angles adds up to 180°, implying each angle is 90°, hence a square. Therefore, the only cyclic rhombus is a square. Thus, the figure must be a square. Hence, each arc between consecutive points is 90°, so arc SP would be 90°, leading to answer D. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different configuration where the rhombus is not a square but still cyclic? But according to the properties, that's impossible. So, the answer should be 90°, which is option D. 

But wait, let me make sure. Suppose the rhombus is not a square. For instance, suppose it's a non-square rhombus. Then, it cannot be cyclic. So, the given that it's inscribed in a circle forces it to be a square. Therefore, the arc measures would be 90°, so answer D. 

Therefore, the measure of arc SP is 90°, so the answer is D.
