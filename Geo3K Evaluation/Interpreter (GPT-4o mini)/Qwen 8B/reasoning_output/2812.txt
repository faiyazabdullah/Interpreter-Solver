Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to make sure I understand the given information and what's being asked. 

So, we have a circle with center V. Points W, X, Y, Z are all on this circle, meaning they lie on the circumference. Therefore, quadrilateral WXYZ is inscribed in the circle, making it a cyclic quadrilateral. The question asks for the measure of angle X, which I assume refers to angle at point X, so ∠WXZ? Wait, no—wait, in quadrilaterals, angle X would typically be the internal angle at vertex X. But since it's a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle, maybe there's some property about opposite angles or something else?

Wait, but first, let me note down all the given information. 

We have points W, X, Y, Z on circle V. So, VW, VX, VY, VZ are all radii of the circle. Also, two angles are given: MeasureOf(Angle(Z, V, Y)) equals 60 degrees, and MeasureOf(Angle(W, V, X)) equals 95 degrees. Wait, these angles are at point V, right? Because the middle letter is V. So Angle(Z, V, Y) means the angle at point V between points Z and Y. Similarly, Angle(W, V, X) is the angle at V between W and X. 

So those are central angles because they're at the center of the circle. Central angles correspond to arcs. For example, the measure of angle ZVY is 60 degrees, so the arc ZY measures 60 degrees. Similarly, angle WVX is 95 degrees, so arc WX measures 95 degrees. 

Now, since the quadrilateral is inscribed in the circle, we can use properties of cyclic quadrilaterals. One key property is that the sum of opposite angles is 180 degrees. However, wait—that applies to the internal angles of the quadrilateral, not necessarily the central angles. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe we can find the other arcs and then relate them to the angles in the quadrilateral. Since the quadrilateral is cyclic, each internal angle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. Wait, yes! For an inscribed angle, the measure is half the measure of its intercepted arc. But if we consider angles formed by two chords intersecting at a point on the circumference, like angle at X in the quadrilateral, then that angle intercepts an arc. Let me recall the exact theorem here.

Inscribed angle theorem: The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So, for instance, angle at X in quadrilateral WXYZ would intercept an arc. Which arc? Let me visualize the quadrilateral WXYZ. The vertices are W, X, Y, Z in order around the circle. So, connecting them in order gives the quadrilateral. Then, angle at X would be formed by sides XW and XY. Therefore, the intercepted arc would be arc WY. Wait, no—if you have angle at X, the intercepted arc is the arc opposite to that angle, which would be arc WY. So the measure of angle X is half the measure of arc WY. 

But how do we find the measure of arc WY? Let's see. We know some other arcs from the given central angles. 

From angle ZVY = 60°, which is a central angle over arc ZY. So arc ZY is 60°. Similarly, angle WVX = 95°, which is a central angle over arc WX, so arc WX is 95°. Now, since the entire circle is 360°, we can try to find other arcs. 

Let me try to figure out the total of all arcs. Let's denote the arcs between consecutive points. Let me list all arcs:

Arc WX: 95° (from angle WVX)
Arc XY: ?
Arc YZ: 60° (from angle ZVY)
Arc ZW: ?

But wait, the arcs between the points W, X, Y, Z. Since the quadrilateral is WXYZ, the arcs between each pair of consecutive points. So the arcs are WX, XY, YZ, and ZW. Their sum should be 360°. 

We already have arc WX = 95°, arc YZ = 60°, but we don't know arc XY and arc ZW. However, perhaps there's another way. Maybe we can find more arcs by considering other angles?

Wait, but we also have angle at V, which is the center. The central angles given are for arcs ZY and WX. Are there other central angles we can infer? Not directly unless we have more info. 

Alternatively, maybe we can find the measure of arc WY, which is needed for angle X. Arc WY would consist of arc WX + arc XY. Wait, no. From W to Y, going through X, that would be arc WX plus arc XY. Alternatively, the other way around, but since it's a circle, the larger arc vs smaller arc depends on the position. But since angle X is an inscribed angle intercepting arc WY, we need to know which arc it's referring to. In cyclic quadrilaterals, the inscribed angle would intercept the arc that doesn't contain the opposite vertex. Wait, maybe I need to think again.

Angle at X intercepts arc WY. Because angle at X is formed by chords XW and XY. So the intercepted arc is the arc that's opposite, i.e., arc WY that does not contain X. Therefore, the measure of angle X is half the measure of arc WY. 

So, if we can find the measure of arc WY, then divide by 2 to get angle X. 

So, arc WY is composed of arc WX + arc XY. Wait, arc from W to Y passing through X. But we need to check if that's the case. Or maybe the other arc? Let me clarify. Suppose the points are arranged in order W, X, Y, Z around the circle. Then, moving from W to Y through X would be arc WXY, which is arc WX + arc XY. However, the arc that is intercepted by angle at X (which is an inscribed angle) would be the arc that's opposite, which would be the arc that doesn't pass through X. Wait, but if the quadrilateral is convex and inscribed, then the intercepted arc would be the one that's not containing X. 

But since the quadrilateral is WXYZ, the order implies that the points are placed in such a way that moving around the circle, we go W -> X -> Y -> Z -> W. Therefore, arc WY that is intercepted by angle at X would be the arc from W to Y that goes through Z, not through X. Wait, no. Let me think again. When you have an inscribed angle at point X, formed by points W and Y. So the intercepted arc is the arc that's opposite, which would be arc WY that does not pass through X. Since the quadrilateral is WXYZ, the arc from W to Y that doesn't pass through X would be arc WYZ? No, arc from W to Y that doesn't go through X would be arc W to Y via Z. Wait, the arc from W to Y could be either the minor arc or major arc depending on the arrangement. 

But since angle X is inside the circle, the intercepted arc is the one that's not containing X. So, if the points are ordered W, X, Y, Z around the circle, then the arc from W to Y that does not contain X would be the arc passing through Z. So that arc would be arc WZ + arc ZY. 

Wait, but arc ZY is given as 60°, and arc WX is 95°, but how do we find arc WZ?

Alternatively, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let's take another approach. Since the total circumference is 360°, we can express the sum of arcs. 

We know arc WX is 95°, arc YZ is 60°, but we need to find arcs XY and ZW. Let me denote:

arc WX = 95°  
arc XY = a  
arc YZ = 60°  
arc ZW = b  

Then, total circumference: 95 + a + 60 + b = 360 → a + b = 360 - 95 - 60 = 205°

Now, the arc WY that is intercepted by angle X would depend on which arc we take. Since angle X is at point X, and the intercepted arc is the one that's opposite. If we take the arc that passes through Z, then arc WY would be arc WZ + arc ZY = b + 60°. Therefore, the measure of angle X would be half of that. 

Alternatively, if the intercepted arc was the other way, through X, but that would be the major arc. But inscribed angles usually refer to the minor arc unless specified otherwise. But since the quadrilateral is convex, the intercepted arc should be the minor arc. Hmm, but without knowing the exact positions, it's a bit ambiguous. Wait, but since the central angles given are for arcs WX and YZ, which are parts of the circle, maybe we can find the other arcs.

Wait, but how can we find arc ZW or arc XY? Unless there's another given angle. Wait, the problem didn't give any other central angles. Wait, but maybe we can find other angles using the fact that the quadrilateral is cyclic. 

Wait, another thought: In a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of the measures of opposite angles is 180 degrees. But those are the internal angles of the quadrilateral, not the central angles. Wait, but we have angles at the center, not at the circumference. 

But maybe we can find the internal angles of the quadrilateral. For example, angle at Z is formed by points W, Z, Y. Wait, the given angle is MeasureOf(Angle(Z, V, Y)) = 60°, which is the central angle at V between Z and Y. That corresponds to arc ZY being 60°, as mentioned before. 

Similarly, angle at V between W and X is 95°, corresponding to arc WX being 95°. 

Now, if I can find the other arcs, then I can compute the intercepted arcs for the angles of the quadrilateral. 

Let me think: The internal angle at X in the quadrilateral is angle WXY. Wait, but earlier I thought it's angle at X, which is ∠WXZ? Wait, no, in quadrilateral WXYZ, the angles are at each vertex. So angle at X would be ∠WXZ? Wait, maybe I need to clarify the notation. 

In standard notation, quadrilateral WXYZ has vertices W, X, Y, Z connected in order. So the internal angles are at each vertex: at W, X, Y, Z. The angle at X is formed by the sides WX and XY. Therefore, the inscribed angle at X intercepts arc WY. 

Therefore, measure of ∠X = ½(measure of arc WY). 

To find arc WY, we need to know the measure of arc from W to Y. As discussed earlier, depending on direction. Since the points are arranged in order W, X, Y, Z around the circle, arc WY that does not pass through X would be arc WZ + arc ZY. 

Arc ZY is 60°, so if we can find arc WZ, then add 60° to get arc WY. 

But how do we find arc WZ? Well, arc WZ is part of the remaining arcs. Earlier, we had arc WX = 95°, arc YZ = 60°, and the sum of arcs XY and ZW is 205°. 

But without more information, how can we find arc ZW? 

Wait, but maybe there's another relationship. Let's think about the other angles. For example, angle at Z. Is there any given angle related to angle at Z? The given angle is MeasureOf(Angle(Z, V, Y)) = 60°, which is the central angle for arc ZY. So that's already accounted for. 

What about angle at W? There's no given angle for that. Similarly for angle at Y. 

Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that the sum of all arcs is 360°, and we can find another equation. Wait, but we only have two equations: arc WX = 95°, arc YZ = 60°, and sum of arc XY + arc ZW = 205°. 

Hmm. It seems like we need another equation. But where can we get that? Perhaps by looking at another angle in the quadrilateral. 

Wait, the problem mentions that the quadrilateral is inscribed in the circle, so maybe there's a relation between the angles of the quadrilateral. For example, the sum of opposite angles is 180°. But since we don't know the other angles, maybe we can relate them through arcs. 

For instance, angle at X is ∠WXZ, which we said intercepts arc WY. Similarly, angle at Y would intercept arc WX. Wait, let me verify. 

At vertex Y, the angle would be formed by sides XY and YZ. So the intercepted arc would be arc XZ. Therefore, measure of angle Y is ½(arc XZ). 

Similarly, angle at W would intercept arc XY, and angle at Z would intercept arc XW. 

But since the quadrilateral is cyclic, the sum of angle X and angle Y would be... Wait, according to cyclic quadrilateral properties, the sum of opposite angles is 180°. So angle X + angle Y = 180°, and angle W + angle Z = 180°. 

But how does that help us? Let's see. 

If we can express angle X and angle Y in terms of arcs, then maybe we can set up equations. 

Let me write:

Measure of angle X = ½(arc WY)  
Measure of angle Y = ½(arc XZ)  
And since angle X + angle Y = 180°, then:

½(arc WY) + ½(arc XZ) = 180°  
→ arc WY + arc XZ = 360°

But arc WY is the same as arc WY, and arc XZ is another arc. Let me see if I can express arc WY and arc XZ in terms of the known arcs.

First, arc WY: as previously discussed, if we take the arc that doesn't pass through X, it would be arc WZ + arc ZY = arc WZ + 60°. 

Arc XZ would be arc XY + arc YZ + arc ZW? No. Wait, arc XZ is from X to Z. Depending on direction. If we take the arc that doesn't pass through Y, then arc XZ would be arc XY + arc YZ? No. Let me think again. 

Points are W, X, Y, Z in order around the circle. So from X to Z, the arc that doesn't pass through Y would be arc XZ going through W. Which would be arc XW + arc WZ. 

Wait, arc XW is 95°, and arc WZ is b. So arc XZ = arc XW + arc WZ = 95° + b. 

Meanwhile, arc WY is arc WZ + arc ZY = b + 60°. 

So substituting back into the equation arc WY + arc XZ = 360°:

(b + 60°) + (95° + b) = 360°  
→ 2b + 155° = 360°  
→ 2b = 205°  
→ b = 102.5°

So arc ZW is 102.5°, which is b. 

Now, arc WY is b + 60° = 102.5 + 60 = 162.5°. 

Thus, measure of angle X is half of that, so 162.5 / 2 = 81.25°. Wait, but none of the options are 81.25. The options are 85, 95, 115, 120. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake somewhere. 

Wait, let me double-check my reasoning. 

I assumed that arc WY + arc XZ = 360°, but why? Because angle X + angle Y = 180°, and each angle is half the intercepted arc. So angle X + angle Y = ½(arc WY) + ½(arc XZ) = 180°, leading to arc WY + arc XZ = 360°. 

But is that accurate? Let me confirm. 

Yes, because angle X and angle Y are supplementary. Therefore, their measures add up to 180°, hence the sum of their intercepted arcs is 360°. 

So that equation is correct. 

But then with that, we found that arc ZW = b = 102.5°, which leads to arc WY = 162.5°, angle X = 81.25°, which isn't among the choices. This suggests an error in my reasoning. 

Where did I go wrong? Let me re-examine the calculation. 

Starting from arc WY + arc XZ = 360°. 

Earlier, I considered arc WY as arc WZ + arc ZY = b + 60°. And arc XZ as arc XW + arc WZ = 95° + b. 

Adding them: (b + 60) + (95 + b) = 2b + 155 = 360 → 2b = 205 → b=102.5. Correct. 

But then arc WY = 102.5 + 60 = 162.5. 

So angle X is half of that, 81.25. But that's not an option. 

Hmm. Maybe I got the intercepted arc wrong. Let me reconsider which arc is intercepted by angle X. 

Angle at X is formed by points W, X, Y. So the inscribed angle at X intercepts arc WY. But maybe I should have taken the other arc, the major arc WY instead of the minor arc. 

Because sometimes inscribed angles can intercept major arcs, but by default, unless stated otherwise, it's the minor arc. However, in cyclic quadrilaterals, the angle is determined by the arc that's opposite, which could be the minor or major arc depending on the position. 

Wait, suppose that angle X intercepts the major arc WY. Then, the measure of angle X would be half the measure of the major arc WY. 

But if that's the case, then the major arc WY would be 360° minus the minor arc WY. 

So let me recast. Let me denote arc WY as the minor arc, which is 162.5°, then the major arc WY would be 360 - 162.5 = 197.5°. 

If angle X intercepts the major arc, then measure of angle X would be 197.5 / 2 = 98.75°, still not matching the options. 

Alternatively, maybe I messed up which arc is intercepted. Let me think again. 

When you have an inscribed angle at point X, formed by points W and Y, the intercepted arc is the arc that is opposite, i.e., not containing X. Since the points are in order W, X, Y, Z, the arc WY that does not contain X would be the arc passing through Z. So that arc is indeed arc WZ + arc ZY = b + 60°, which is 162.5°. So that seems correct. 

But why isn't this matching the answer choices? Maybe there's a different interpretation of the given angles. 

Wait, the given angles are central angles. For example, angle ZVY is 60°, which is a central angle, so arc ZY is 60°. Similarly, angle WVX is 95°, central angle, so arc WX is 95°. 

Is there another way to find arc XY or arc ZW? Let me think. 

Suppose we look at the other central angles. For example, if we can find the measure of arc XY or arc ZW through other means. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's another angle given indirectly. For instance, maybe the sum of all arcs around the circle can be used with the known arcs. 

Wait, we have arc WX = 95°, arc YZ = 60°, and arc XY + arc ZW = 205°, as before. 

But without more data, we cannot determine individual values of arc XY and arc ZW. However, we used the cyclic quadrilateral property that angle X + angle Y = 180°, leading us to derive arc WY + arc XZ = 360°, allowing us to find arc ZW. 

But even then, the resulting angle X is 81.25°, which is not among the options. Hence, I must have made an error in determining which arc is intercepted by angle X. 

Alternative approach: Let's consider that angle at X is actually formed by points W, X, Z. Wait, no—the quadrilateral is WXYZ, so the angle at X is between segments XW and XY, not XZ. 

Wait, maybe I misread the question. The question says: "Find m∠X". In the context of quadrilateral WXYZ, ∠X refers to the internal angle at vertex X, which is between sides WX and XY. 

Another idea: Maybe I made a mistake in assuming the intercepted arc for angle X. Instead of arc WY, maybe it's arc WZ? No, that wouldn't make sense. 

Wait, let me think about the formula for an inscribed angle. An inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So if angle at X is formed by chords XW and XY, then the intercepted arc is the arc from W to Y that does not pass through X. 

Which is arc WZY, which is arc WZ + arc ZY = b + 60°, as before. 

But if that's the case, then angle X = ½*(b + 60) = ½*(102.5 + 60) = ½*162.5 = 81.25°. Still not matching. 

Hmm. Let me check if there's another way to calculate angle X. 

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the other angles. For example, if we can find angle Y, then since angle X + angle Y = 180°, we can find angle X. 

Let me try that. 

Angle Y is at vertex Y, formed by points X, Y, Z. So intercepted arc is arc XZ. 

As before, arc XZ is arc XW + arc WZ = 95° + b. 

So measure of angle Y = ½*(95 + b). 

Since angle X + angle Y = 180°, then:

½*(b + 60) + ½*(95 + b) = 180  
Multiply both sides by 2:

(b + 60) + (95 + b) = 360  
Same as before: 2b + 155 = 360 → b = 102.5°. 

So angle X = ½*(b + 60) = ½*(102.5 + 60) = 81.25°. 

Still the same result. 

This suggests that the answer is not among the choices. But since the options are given, maybe I have misunderstood the problem. 

Wait, perhaps the given angles are not central angles but inscribed angles? Let me re-examine the original problem. 

The problem states:

- PointLiesOnCircle(Z, Circle(V))  
- PointLiesOnCircle(W, Circle(V))  
- PointLiesOnCircle(X, Circle(V))  
- PointLiesOnCircle(Y, Circle(V))  
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(Z, V, Y)), 60)  
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(W, V, X)), 95)  

Ah! Here's a critical point. The angle MeasureOf(Angle(Z, V, Y)) is the angle at point V between points Z and Y. That is, the angle at the center V, so it's definitely a central angle. Same for the other one. So arc ZY is 60°, arc WX is 95°. 

But maybe there's a misunderstanding in how the arcs are measured. Let me check again. 

Total of arcs: arc WX = 95°, arc YZ = 60°, and arc XY + arc ZW = 205°. 

Wait, but what if the arc WX is not the arc from W to X, but the arc from X to W? No, the notation Angle(W, V, X) means the angle at V between W and X, so the arc between W and X. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the intercepted arc for angle X. Let me think differently. 

If the quadrilateral is inscribed in the circle, then the measure of angle X can also be calculated using the formula involving the arcs. 

Alternatively, since we know two arcs, maybe we can find other arcs using the fact that the total is 360°, and use the fact that the sum of angles in the quadrilateral is (4-2)*180 = 360°, but that includes all four angles. However, without knowing the other angles, this may not help directly. 

Wait, but if I assume that the angle at X is 81.25°, which is not an option, but the closest option is 85°. Maybe there's a rounding or a mistake in calculation. 

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated arc WY. Let me recheck the calculation. 

We found arc ZW = b = 102.5°, arc ZY = 60°, so arc WY = b + 60 = 162.5°, correct. 

Then angle X is 162.5 / 2 = 81.25°. 

But none of the options are close to that. Let me check if there's another possibility. 

Wait, maybe the intercepted arc is not arc WY but arc WZ? No, that wouldn't make sense. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle at X intercepts arc WY, but the arc is the other one. For example, if arc WY is the major arc, then its measure is 360 - 162.5 = 197.5°, and angle X would be half of that, 98.75°, still not matching. 

Wait, but what if I made a mistake in the assumption about the intercepted arc? 

Maybe the angle at X is actually an external angle? No, the problem says it's a quadrilateral inscribed in the circle, so it's a convex quadrilateral. All internal angles are less than 180°. 

Wait, another thought: Maybe the given central angles are not directly the arcs but involve other relationships. For example, maybe the angle at V is not just the central angle but involves other factors. 

No, the central angle is defined as the angle at the center between two points on the circle, so it directly determines the arc measure. 

Wait, unless there's a typo in the problem, or I've misread the given angles. Let me check again. 

Original problem says: 

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(Z, V, Y)), 60)  
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(W, V, X)), 95)  

These are angles at V, so central angles. 

So arc ZY = 60°, arc WX = 95°. 

Perhaps there's another way to find arc XY or arc ZW? Let me think. 

Wait, if I consider the entire circle, the arcs are: 

arc WX = 95°  
arc XY = ?  
arc YZ = 60°  
arc ZW = ?  

Summing to 360°: 95 + arc XY + 60 + arc ZW = 360 → arc XY + arc ZW = 205°. 

But without more information, I can't find individual values. However, using the cyclic quadrilateral property, we were able to find arc ZW = 102.5°, arc XY = 205 - 102.5 = 102.5°. 

Wait, arc XY = 102.5°, arc ZW = 102.5°. 

But then, what about angle at W? Let's say angle at W is formed by points Z, W, X. So intercepted arc would be arc ZX. 

Arc ZX would be arc ZW + arc WX = 102.5 + 95 = 197.5°. So angle at W is 197.5 / 2 = 98.75°. 

Similarly, angle at Z would be formed by points Y, Z, W. Intercepted arc would be arc YW. Arc YW is arc YZ + arc ZW = 60 + 102.5 = 162.5°, so angle at Z is 162.5 / 2 = 81.25°. 

Then, since angle X + angle Y = 180°, angle Y is formed by points X, Y, Z. Intercepted arc is arc XZ. Arc XZ is arc XY + arc YZ = 102.5 + 60 = 162.5°, so angle Y is 81.25°. Thus, angle X + angle Y = 81.25 + 81.25 = 162.5°, which contradicts the cyclic quadrilateral property that they should sum to 180°. 

Wait, this indicates a contradiction, which means my previous assumption is wrong. 

Where is the error? 

Ah! I think I made a mistake in calculating the intercepted arc for angle Y. Let me redo that. 

Angle at Y is formed by points X, Y, Z. So the intercepted arc is arc XZ that does not pass through Y. Since the points are in order W, X, Y, Z, the arc XZ not passing through Y would be arc XW + arc WZ = 95 + 102.5 = 197.5°. Therefore, angle Y is half of that, 98.75°. 

Then, angle X + angle Y = 81.25 + 98.75 = 180°, which works. 

So angle X is 81.25°, which is not among the options. But this suggests that either there's a mistake in the problem setup, or I made a mistake in the logic. 

But the answer choices are A. 85, B. 95, C. 115, D. 120. 

Hmm. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in identifying which arc is intercepted by angle X. 

Let me try a different approach. Let's calculate the measure of angle X using the arcs. 

Given that arc WX = 95°, arc YZ = 60°, and arc XY + arc ZW = 205°. 

Assume that angle X is formed by points W, X, Y. So the inscribed angle at X intercepts arc WY. 

But arc WY can be calculated as arc WX + arc XY or arc WZ + arc ZY. 

Wait, arc WY can be either the arc passing through X or the one passing through Z. 

If we take the arc passing through X, it's arc WX + arc XY = 95 + arc XY. 

If we take the arc passing through Z, it's arc WZ + arc ZY = arc ZW + 60. 

But which one is intercepted? 

Since angle at X is inside the circle, the intercepted arc is the one that doesn't contain X. So the arc WY that doesn't pass through X would be the one passing through Z. So arc WY = arc WZ + arc ZY = b + 60. 

But earlier, we found that b = 102.5°, so arc WY = 162.5°, giving angle X = 81.25°. 

But since this is not an option, maybe the question is referring to a different angle? Like, perhaps it's asking for the reflex angle at X? No, that doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, maybe there's an error in the problem statement, or perhaps I missed a key detail. 

Wait, let me check the initial problem again. 

The problem says: Quadrilateral WXYZ is inscribed in ⊙V. Find m∠X. Given that MeasureOf(Angle(Z, V, Y)) = 60 and MeasureOf(Angle(W, V, X)) = 95. 

Wait, maybe the angle at X is not the internal angle but another angle? For example, maybe it's referring to the angle at X in triangle VXW or something else? No, the question specifies "m∠X" in the quadrilateral. 

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the given angles at V are not central angles but something else. Wait, no, the angle at V between Z and Y is a central angle, as V is the center. 

Wait, unless there's a misunderstanding in the notation. For example, Angle(Z, V, Y) might mean the angle at V between Z and Y, which is a central angle. Yes, that's what it is. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle at V is not a central angle, but an inscribed angle? No, because V is the center. 

Wait, unless the points are not in order W, X, Y, Z around the circle. Maybe they are arranged differently? For example, maybe the order is W, Z, Y, X or something else? But the problem states it's a quadrilateral WXYZ, which typically implies the order W-X-Y-Z-W. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to tell. Maybe the points are not in the order I assumed. 

Suppose the points are arranged such that arc WX is 95°, arc ZY is 60°, but the other arcs are different. Let me try assuming that arc XY is 95°, and arc ZW is 60°, but that would make the total arc WX + arc XY + arc YZ + arc ZW = 95 + 95 + 60 + 60 = 310°, which is not 360°. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another relationship I haven't considered. 

Wait, what if the angle at V (the central angles) are related to the angles of the quadrilateral? For example, the central angle over arc WX is 95°, and the central angle over arc YZ is 60°. 

But how does that relate to the angles of the quadrilateral? 

Each internal angle of the quadrilateral is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Wait, no, for an inscribed angle, it's half the measure of the intercepted arc. 

Wait, but if I consider the angle at X, it's half the measure of arc WY. But arc WY is 162.5°, giving 81.25°. 

But this is not among the choices. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the measure of angle V, but that's not what it says. 

Wait, the question is asking for m∠X, which is the angle at X in the quadrilateral. 

Given that the answer choices are A. 85, B. 95, C. 115, D. 120, and our calculation is 81.25, which is closest to 85. But why is there a discrepancy? 

Maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup, or perhaps I missed a key insight. 

Wait, let me consider that the given central angles might be for different arcs. For example, angle ZVY = 60°, which is the central angle for arc ZY, so arc ZY = 60°. Angle WVX = 95°, which is the central angle for arc WX, so arc WX = 95°. 

Now, let's consider the total of all arcs: 

arc WX = 95°  
arc XY = x  
arc YZ = 60°  
arc ZW = y  

So, 95 + x + 60 + y = 360 → x + y = 205°. 

Now, the angle at X is formed by points W, X, Y. So it intercepts arc WY. 

But arc WY can be calculated as arc WX + arc XY = 95 + x, or arc WZ + arc ZY = y + 60. 

Depending on which arc is intercepted. 

But in a cyclic quadrilateral, the angle at X would intercept the arc that is opposite to it, which is the arc that doesn't contain X. So if the points are in order W, X, Y, Z, then the arc WY not containing X is arc WZ + arc ZY = y + 60. 

So angle X = ½(y + 60). 

Similarly, angle Y intercepts arc WX + arc ZY = 95 + 60 = 155°, so angle Y = 155/2 = 77.5°. 

Wait, but then angle X + angle Y = ½(y+60) + 77.5 = 180°. 

Substituting: 

½(y + 60) + 77.5 = 180  
=> y + 60 + 155 = 360  
=> y = 360 - 155 - 60 = 145°. 

Wait, this gives y = 145°. 

Then, since x + y = 205°, x = 205 - 145 = 60°. 

So arc XY = 60°, arc ZW = 145°. 

Then, angle X is ½(y + 60) = ½(145 + 60) = ½(205) = 102.5°. 

Still not matching the options. 

Wait, but where did I get angle Y = 77.5°? Let me check. 

Angle at Y is formed by points X, Y, Z. So it intercepts arc XZ. 

Arc XZ can be calculated as arc XY + arc YZ = x + 60. 

With x = 60°, arc XZ = 60 + 60 = 120°, so angle Y = 120/2 = 60°. 

Wait, this contradicts the previous calculation. 

Wait, I think I made a mistake in calculating angle Y. Let me re-calculate. 

If arc XZ is arc XY + arc YZ = x + 60. With x = 60°, arc XZ = 60 + 60 = 120°, so angle Y = 120/2 = 60°. 

Then, angle X + angle Y = 102.5 + 60 = 162.5°, which is not 180°. This indicates another inconsistency. 

Hmm, this suggests that my assumption about which arc is intercepted by angle Y is incorrect. 

Let me re-evaluate angle Y. 

Angle at Y is formed by points X, Y, Z. The intercepted arc is the arc that does not contain Y. Since the points are in order W, X, Y, Z, the arc XZ that does not contain Y would be arc XW + arc WZ = 95 + y. 

With y = 145°, this arc is 95 + 145 = 240°, so angle Y = 240/2 = 120°. 

Then, angle X + angle Y = 102.5 + 120 = 222.5°, which is not 180°. 

Clearly, there's confusion in determining which arc is intercepted. 

This indicates that my understanding of which arc is intercepted by each angle is flawed. 

Let me recall the correct method for finding the intercepted arc for an inscribed angle. 

An inscribed angle is formed by two chords sharing a common endpoint (the vertex of the angle), and the intercepted arc is the arc opposite the angle, not containing the vertex. 

So, for angle at X, formed by chords XW and XY, the intercepted arc is arc WY that does not contain X. 

Similarly, for angle at Y, formed by chords YX and YZ, the intercepted arc is arc XZ that does not contain Y. 

So, in the case of angle Y, arc XZ not containing Y would be arc XW + arc WZ. 

So, with arc XW = 95°, arc WZ = y, so arc XZ = 95 + y. 

Therefore, angle Y = ½(95 + y). 

Earlier, we had angle X = ½(y + 60), and angle X + angle Y = 180°, so:

½(y + 60) + ½(95 + y) = 180  
Multiply by 2: (y + 60) + (95 + y) = 360  
2y + 155 = 360  
2y = 205  
y = 102.5° 

Thus, angle X = ½(102.5 + 60) = 81.25°, same as before. 

But this still doesn't match any of the options. 

At this point, I suspect there might be a mistake in the problem or perhaps a misinterpretation of the given angles. 

Alternatively, perhaps the given angles are not central angles but inscribed angles? Let me explore this possibility. 

If Angle(Z, V, Y) = 60° is an inscribed angle, then it would intercept arc ZY, and the measure would be half the arc. So if it's an inscribed angle, then arc ZY = 120°. Similarly, Angle(W, V, X) = 95° would be an inscribed angle, intercepting arc WX = 190°. But this would make the arcs too large, and the total would exceed 360°. 

But this seems unlikely, as V is the center, so it should be a central angle. 

Alternatively, maybe the given angles are not at the center, but at some other point. 

Wait, the problem says: PointLiesOnCircle(Z, Circle(V)), so all points W, X, Y, Z are on the circle with center V. 

So, Angle(Z, V, Y) is the angle at V between Z and Y, which is a central angle. 

Given that, and the calculations leading to angle X = 81.25°, which is not among the options, but the closest is 85° (option A). 

Maybe the problem expects rounding, or there's a calculation mistake. Let me check if there's an alternative approach. 

Wait, let's consider that the sum of all arcs is 360°, and the given arcs are 95° and 60°, so the remaining arcs sum to 205°. 

If we assume that the arc WX is 95°, and arc YZ is 60°, and the other two arcs are equal, then arc XY = arc ZW = 205/2 = 102.5°. 

Then, angle X is ½(arc WY), where arc WY is arc WZ + arc ZY = 102.5 + 60 = 162.5°, so angle X = 81.25°. 

But if the problem assumes that the angle is measured as the supplement of this, or there's a miscalculation. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle at X is calculated as half the difference of the arcs. Wait, no, that's for when you have two intersecting chords. 

Wait, another idea: Maybe the angle at X is formed by two chords, and it's an inscribed angle, but it's also related to the central angles. 

For example, if we draw the diagonals of the cyclic quadrilateral, but I don't see how that helps. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involved. For example, triangle VXW has a central angle of 95°, so it's an is
