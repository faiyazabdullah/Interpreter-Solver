Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out everything provided.

We have points Q, R, S, T, A, C. There are angles mentioned: Angle(Q, C, A) and Angle(S, T, R). Also, there are measures given for two angles: MeasureOf(Angle(A, R, S)) is 71 degrees, and MeasureOf(Angle(S, Q, T)) is 106 degrees. Additionally, there are tangent lines: Line(C, Q) is tangent to Circle(T), and Line(R, A) is also tangent to Circle(T).

The question asks for the measure of arc QTS, denoted as m$\widehat{QTS}$. So, we need to find the measure of that arc. 

First, let me recall some circle theorems. Since there are tangents involved, maybe I should consider the properties of tangent lines to a circle. Remember that the radius at the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent line. Also, if two tangent segments are drawn from the same external point to a circle, those segments are congruent. But here, we have two different tangent lines: one from point C to circle T (Line CQ), and another from point R to circle T (Line RA). Wait, but the circle is named T? That seems odd because T is also a point. Maybe there's a typo? Or perhaps the circle is labeled as T, so the circle has center T? Wait, the predicate says "Circle(T)", so maybe the circle is centered at T? Hmm, that could make sense. So, Circle(T) would mean a circle with center T. Then, Line(C,Q) is tangent to this circle, so the radius from T to the point of tangency would be perpendicular to Line CQ. Similarly for Line(R,A) being tangent to the same circle, so the radius from T to the point where Line RA touches the circle would be perpendicular to Line RA.

Wait, but the tangent lines are Line(C,Q) and Line(R,A). So, the points of tangency would be Q and A? Because if a line is tangent to a circle, the point where it touches the circle is called the point of tangency. But the line is named Line(C,Q). So, does that mean the point Q is the point of tangency? Because if the line is tangent to the circle, then the point of tangency lies on the line. However, since the line is defined by points C and Q, then either C or Q is the point of tangency. But the line is tangent to the circle, so one of these points must lie on the circle. But the circle is named T. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation. The predicate says "Tangent(Line(C, Q), Circle(T))", so Line(CQ) is tangent to Circle(T). Therefore, the line CQ touches the circle at exactly one point. That point could be Q or another point, but since Q is part of the line, maybe Q is the point of tangency. Similarly for Line(RA) being tangent to the same circle, so maybe A is the point of tangency?

Alternatively, maybe the points C and Q are external points, and the line CQ is tangent to the circle. In that case, the point of tangency would be somewhere along the line CQ, not necessarily at Q or C. But the problem states that Line(CQ) is tangent to the circle. So, if Q is on the circle, then the line CQ would pass through Q, which is on the circle, making Q the point of tangency. Similarly for Line(RA) being tangent to the circle, implying that A is the point of tangency. Wait, but then the circle would have points Q and A on it. But then the circle's center is T? Wait, the circle is named T, which might imply that T is the center. So, the circle has center T, and points Q and A are on the circle. Because if Line CQ is tangent to the circle, then Q is the point where the tangent meets the circle, so Q is on the circle. Similarly, A is on the circle because Line RA is tangent to the circle. Therefore, points Q and A are on the circle centered at T. 

So, the circle with center T has points Q and A on its circumference. Therefore, TQ and TA are radii of the circle. Since T is the center, TQ = TA = radius. Also, since Line CQ is tangent to the circle at Q, then the radius TQ is perpendicular to the tangent line CQ. So, angle between TQ and CQ is 90 degrees. Similarly, the radius TA is perpendicular to the tangent line RA, so angle between TA and RA is 90 degrees. 

Now, looking at the angles given. The first angle is Angle(Q, C, A), which is ∠QCA. Wait, angle at point C, with sides CQ and CA. Then, another angle is Angle(S, T, R), which is ∠STR. Also, MeasureOf(Angle(A, R, S)) is 71 degrees. Wait, that's ∠ARS? Wait, angle with vertex at R, between points A, R, S. So, ∠ARS is 71 degrees. And MeasureOf(Angle(S, Q, T)) is 106 degrees, which is ∠SQT, angle at Q between S and T. 

So, let me try to visualize this. Points Q and A are on the circle centered at T. Lines CQ and RA are tangent to the circle at Q and A respectively. So, CQ is tangent at Q, so TQ ⊥ CQ. Similarly, RA is tangent at A, so TA ⊥ RA. 

Let me sketch mentally: Circle with center T. Points Q and A on the circle. Line CQ is tangent at Q, so CQ ⊥ TQ. Similarly, line RA is tangent at A, so RA ⊥ TA. Now, there's also points S and R. The angle ∠ARS is 71 degrees, and ∠SQT is 106 degrees. Also, there's an angle ∠QCA, which is angle at C between Q and A. 

But how do these points connect? Let me think about the configuration. We have points Q and A on the circle. Points C and R are connected via lines CQ and RA. Points S and T are mentioned in angles. The angle ∠SQT is 106 degrees, which involves points S, Q, T. Also, ∠ARS is 71 degrees, involving points A, R, S. 

Hmm. Perhaps points S and T are related to the circle? Since T is the center of the circle. So, point T is the center, and S is another point. Also, there's a point R connected to A via line RA. 

Maybe we can use the fact that T is the center. So, TQ and TA are radii. Also, since CQ is tangent at Q, then CT is the hypotenuse of a right triangle TQC, where angle at Q is 90 degrees. Similarly, RT is the hypotenuse of triangle RYT, where Y is the point of tangency, but here it's RA tangent at A, so RT would be... wait, no. If RA is tangent at A, then the radius TA is perpendicular to RA. So, TA ⊥ RA. So, triangle TAR has a right angle at A. 

Now, considering the angles given. Let me note down the given angles:

1. MeasureOf(∠ARS) = 71°. This is angle at R between A and S. So, ∠ARS = 71°.
2. MeasureOf(∠SQT) = 106°. This is angle at Q between S and T. So, ∠SQT = 106°.
Also, Angle(Q, C, A) is ∠QCA. Not sure yet about its measure.

Our goal is to find the measure of arc QTS. Arc QTS would be the arc from Q to S passing through T? Wait, arcs are typically measured in terms of the central angle. But the notation m$\widehat{QTS}$ suggests that it's the arc starting at Q, going through T, ending at S. Wait, but T is the center of the circle. So, if T is the center, then points Q and S must be on the circle. Wait, but earlier I thought Q is on the circle, but S is not mentioned as being on the circle. Unless S is also on the circle. Let me check.

Since there's a tangent line Line(S, T, R)? Wait, no. The predicate says Angle(S, T, R), which is ∠STR. So, points S, T, R form an angle at T. Also, there's the tangent line Line(R, A) to the circle. So, maybe S is a point such that line ST is something? Or maybe S is another point on the circle?

Alternatively, since T is the center, and there's an angle ∠SQT = 106°, which is at point Q. Since Q is on the circle, and T is the center, QT is a radius. So, ∠SQT is formed by points S, Q, T. So, if I imagine point S outside the circle, then QS is a secant or tangent? Or maybe inside?

Wait, ∠SQT is at point Q, so Q is the vertex. So, the angle between SQ and QT. Since QT is a radius (from Q to center T), and SQ is a segment from Q to S. Depending on where S is, this angle could vary.

But how do we find the measure of arc QTS? Well, arc QTS would be the arc from Q to S passing through T. But T is the center, so unless S is another point on the circle, this arc wouldn't make sense. Wait, maybe the arc is from Q to S, and the measure is determined by the central angle subtended by that arc. But if T is the center, then the arc QS would correspond to the central angle ∠QTS. Wait, but the question is about arc QTS, which may involve three points. Wait, sometimes arc notation like QTS implies the arc from Q to S passing through T. But since T is the center, that would mean the arc goes from Q to S through the center? No, arcs are parts of the circle, so if T is the center, then the arc from Q to S would be part of the circle, not passing through T. Unless T is on the arc, but T is the center, so it's inside the circle. So, arc QTS would actually be the major arc QS if T is inside the circle. Wait, this is confusing. Maybe the arc QTS refers to the arc from Q to S that passes through T, but since T is the center, that would require T to be on the circle, which it isn't. Therefore, perhaps there's a misinterpretation here.

Alternatively, maybe the arc is named QTS, meaning the arc from Q to S, with T being a point on the arc. But since T is the center, that would require T to be on the circle, which contradicts the definition of a circle's center. Hence, this suggests that my initial assumption that T is the center might be wrong. Maybe the circle is just named T, but T is a point on the circle. Wait, but the predicate says Circle(T), which usually denotes a circle with center T. However, if T is a point on the circle, then the circle's center would be different. This is conflicting. 

Wait, perhaps there's confusion in notation. In some contexts, a circle can be named by its center. For example, if there's a circle with center at point T, then the circle can be referred to as Circle(T). But if T is a point on the circle, then it's not the center. So, the problem statement uses Circle(T), so likely T is the center. Therefore, T is the center of the circle. Therefore, points Q and A are on the circle, as they are points of tangency for the tangent lines CQ and RA. 

Therefore, returning to the arc QTS. Since T is the center, not on the circle, the arc QTS must refer to the arc from Q to S passing through some other point. Alternatively, maybe there's a typo, and the arc is supposed to be QS, but the question says QTS. Let me check again. The question is m$\widehat{QTS}$. The notation for arcs usually requires the endpoints and possibly a third point to indicate direction. So, $\widehat{QTS}$ would be the arc from Q to S, passing through T. But since T is the center, which is inside the circle, this arc would go from Q to S through the interior of the circle. But arcs are subsets of the circle's circumference. Therefore, this notation might be incorrect. Alternatively, maybe T is a point on the arc? If T were on the arc, then it would be part of the circle, but T is the center, so that can't be. Therefore, this suggests that there might be a misunderstanding in interpreting the circle's name. 

Alternatively, maybe the circle is not named T, but the circle is associated with point T. For instance, maybe the circle is centered at T, but T is not on the circle. So, the circle has center T, and points Q and A are on the circle. Then, points S and R are other points. 

Assuming that, let's proceed. Given that, the arc QTS is ambiguous, but maybe the problem means the arc from Q to S, and the measure is computed using certain angles. Alternatively, maybe it's referring to the arc that corresponds to the central angle over the points Q, T, and S. Wait, but T is the center, so the central angle would be ∠QTS. But if T is the center, then the arc QS would correspond to the central angle ∠QTS. However, the question says arc QTS, which may imply that the arc includes T, but since T is the center, not on the circle, this doesn't fit. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in assuming that T is the center. 

Wait, let me re-examine the predicates. One of the predicates is "Tangent(Line(C, Q), Circle(T))". This means that the line CQ is tangent to the circle named T. So, the circle is named T, which is a bit non-standard. Typically, circles are named by their centers or by a single letter, but if T is the name of the circle, then maybe T is the center. Otherwise, if T is a point, then the circle is named T, which is unclear. This ambiguity might be critical. 

Perhaps the circle is named T, but T is a point on the circle. Wait, but then the circle's center would be a different point. However, without more information, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, maybe the circle is centered at T, and T is a point not on the circle. 

Given that, proceeding under the assumption that T is the center of the circle, and points Q and A are on the circle. Thus, TQ and TA are radii. 

Now, back to the angles. Let's focus on the given angles. We know that ∠ARS = 71°, and ∠SQT = 106°. Our goal is to find the measure of arc QTS. Assuming that arc QTS is the arc from Q to S passing through T, but since T is the center, this arc would not exist on the circle. Therefore, perhaps there's a misinterpretation. Maybe the arc is meant to be QS, and the measure is found using the central angle ∠QTS, even though T is the center. 

Wait, if we consider that ∠QTS is a central angle, then the measure of arc QS would be equal to the measure of ∠QTS. So, if we can find ∠QTS, that would give us the measure of arc QS. However, the question mentions arc QTS, which might be intended as arc QS, with T being the center. 

Alternatively, maybe the arc QTS is composed of arcs QT and TS, but that would require S to be on the circle. 

This confusion suggests that I need to clarify the setup. Let me try to reconstruct the diagram step by step. 

Points:

- Q and A are points of tangency on the circle centered at T.
- C is a point such that line CQ is tangent to the circle at Q.
- R is a point such that line RA is tangent to the circle at A.
- There's an angle ∠ARS = 71°, which is at point R, between points A, R, S.
- There's an angle ∠SQT = 106°, at point Q, between points S, Q, T.
- Need to find the measure of arc QTS.

Assuming that T is the center, then QT is a radius. So, ∠SQT is an angle at Q between SQ and QT. Since QT is a radius, and SQ is a segment from Q to S. 

Let me consider triangle SQT. In triangle SQT, we know angle at Q is 106°, and QT is a radius. If we can find other angles or sides, maybe we can find something. But without knowing where S is, this is tricky. 

Alternatively, maybe using the given angle ∠ARS = 71°, which involves points A, R, S. Since RA is tangent to the circle at A, and R is connected to A. So, RA is tangent at A, hence RA is perpendicular to TA. 

So, in triangle RAT, since RA is tangent at A, then TA ⊥ RA. So, angle at A in triangle RAT is 90°. 

Similarly, in triangle TQC, since CQ is tangent at Q, then TQ ⊥ CQ. So, angle at Q in triangle TQC is 90°. 

Now, let me see if we can relate these triangles to the other angles. 

We have ∠ARS = 71°, which is at point R. So, point R is connected to A and S. Since RA is tangent at A, and S is another point. 

Possibly, points S and C are connected in some way. The angle ∠SQT is at Q, connecting S, Q, T. 

Maybe there's a cyclic quadrilateral or some intersecting lines. 

Alternatively, consider the power of a point. For point R, since RA is tangent to the circle at A, the power of R with respect to the circle is RA². Similarly for point C, power is CQ². 

But I don't see immediate connections to the angles given. 

Let me think about the angles. Let's look at ∠ARS = 71°. At point R, between A and S. Since RA is tangent at A, and S is some point. If I can find relations involving triangle ARS or other triangles. 

Also, ∠SQT = 106°, at Q. Since QT is a radius, and SQ is a line from Q to S. 

Perhaps we need to consider the sum of angles around point Q or other points. 

Let me try to consider triangle SQT. In triangle SQT, we know one angle at Q is 106°, and we might find other angles if we can relate them to other parts of the diagram. 

But to do that, we need more information about the other angles or sides. 

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, but without knowing other angles, this might not help directly. 

Another idea: since T is the center, and Q is on the circle, then QT is a radius. Also, if we can find the measure of ∠QTS, which would be the central angle corresponding to arc QS. But the question is about arc QTS, which might be the same as arc QS. 

Wait, if the arc QTS is intended to be arc QS, then its measure would be equal to the central angle ∠QTS. So, if we can find ∠QTS, that would be our answer. 

But how do we find ∠QTS? Let's see. 

Looking at the given angles, we have ∠ARS = 71°, ∠SQT = 106°, and possibly others. 

Let me consider triangle ARS. In triangle ARS, we know angle at R is 71°, and we might relate it to other parts. 

Additionally, since RA is tangent at A, then TA ⊥ RA. So, in triangle ART, angle at A is 90°. 

If we can find some relationship between triangles ARS and others, perhaps we can find angles that help us. 

Also, since ∠SQT is 106°, which is at Q, and QT is a radius. If we can find the measure of ∠QTS, then we can get the arc measure. 

Let me attempt to find ∠QTS. 

In triangle SQT, we have angle at Q is 106°, and angle at T is what we're trying to find. To find angle at T, we need more info. Maybe relating to other angles. 

Alternatively, consider quadrilaterals or other figures. 

Wait, perhaps there's a way to relate the angles using the fact that CQ and RA are tangents. 

For instance, since CQ is tangent at Q, then CQ ⊥ TQ. Similarly, RA ⊥ TA. 

So, if we can find angles involving lines CQ and RA, maybe we can find relations. 

Let me consider point C. Since CQ is tangent at Q, and we have angle ∠QCA. Which is angle at C between Q and A. 

So, in triangle QCA, we have angle at C, which is ∠QCA. But we don't know its measure. 

However, if we can find other angles in triangle QCA, maybe we can use that. 

Alternatively, since CQ is tangent at Q, and QA is a line from Q to A, which is on the circle. 

Wait, but A is also on the circle. So, QA is a chord of the circle. 

So, QA is a chord, and CQ is tangent at Q. 

In such cases, there's a property that the angle between a tangent and a chord is equal to the inscribed angle on the opposite side of the chord. 

Yes! The angle between tangent CQ and chord QA is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. 

So, ∠CQA (angle between tangent CQ and chord QA) is equal to the angle that QA subtends in the alternate segment. 

But what's the alternate segment? The angle in the alternate segment would be the angle subtended by QA at the circumference on the opposite side of the circle. 

So, if we consider chord QA, the alternate segment would be the arc QA not containing the tangent point Q. So, the angle between tangent CQ and chord QA (∠CQA) equals the angle subtended by QA in the alternate segment, which would be ∠QTA, since T is the center. Wait, no. The angle in the alternate segment would be an inscribed angle. 

Wait, the angle between the tangent and the chord is equal to the inscribed angle on the opposite side of the chord. So, ∠CQA = ∠QAB, where B is a point on the circumference in the alternate segment. 

But since we don't have point B, maybe this is not helpful immediately. 

Alternatively, since T is the center, and QA is a chord, then the angle ∠QTA is twice the angle subtended by QA at the circumference. 

But I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to proceed. 

The angle between tangent CQ and chord QA is ∠CQA. According to the Alternate Segment Theorem, this angle is equal to the angle that QA subtends in the alternate segment. Let's call that angle θ. 

So, ∠CQA = θ. 

Also, since T is the center, and QA is a chord, then ∠QTA is the central angle subtending the same arc QA. So, ∠QTA = 2θ. 

But we don't know θ, but maybe we can find it through other angles. 

However, we don't have direct information about ∠CQA. But maybe we can relate it to other angles. 

Alternatively, let's consider triangle QCA. In triangle QCA, we have angle at C (∠QCA), angle at Q (∠CQA), and angle at A (∠QAC). The sum of angles is 180°. 

But without knowing any of these angles, this might not help. 

Let me think about the other given angle: ∠ARS = 71°. 

At point R, angle between A and S. Since RA is tangent at A, and S is some point. Let's assume that S is another point on the circle or elsewhere. 

If S is on the circle, then RS would be a secant or tangent. But since we don't know, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, maybe points Q, R, S, T are arranged in a particular way. 

Wait, we also have ∠SQT = 106°, which is at Q between S and T. So, if we consider triangle SQT, with angle at Q being 106°, and angle at T being what we want to find. 

If we can find another angle in this triangle, we can compute the third. 

To find another angle, maybe we can relate it to other parts of the diagram. 

For example, if we can find angle at S in triangle SQT. 

But how? 

Alternatively, consider that S is connected to T and Q. If S is on the circle, then ST is a radius, but T is the center. So, ST would be a radius, and QT is also a radius. So, ST and QT are both radii, hence equal in length. 

Thus, triangle SQT would have sides QT and ST as radii, so triangle SQT is isoceles with QT = ST. 

Wait, if S is on the circle, then ST is a radius. But if S is on the circle, then yes. But is S on the circle? 

From the given angle ∠SQT = 106°, which is at Q. If S is on the circle, then QS would be a chord, and QT is a radius. 

But how can we confirm that S is on the circle? 

Well, if S is on the circle, then the line QS would be a chord, and ∠SQT would be an angle formed by a chord QS and a radius QT. 

But without more information, it's unclear. However, since the question asks about arc QTS, it's possible that S is on the circle, making the arc QTS part of the circle. 

Assuming that S is on the circle, then ST is a radius. Therefore, triangle SQT has two sides as radii (QT and ST), making it isoceles with base QS. 

In that case, the angles at Q and S would be equal. Wait, no. In an isoceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are equal. Here, QT and ST are equal (both radii), so angles opposite them would be ∠SQT and ∠QST. Wait, no. Let me label the triangle properly. 

Triangle SQT has vertices S, Q, T. If QT and ST are both radii (assuming S is on the circle), then sides QT and ST are equal. So, in triangle SQT, sides QT and ST are equal, hence it is isoceles with base QS. Therefore, angles opposite these equal sides are equal. The equal sides are QT and ST, so the angles opposite them would be ∠SQT and ∠QST. Wait, no. Side QT is opposite angle at S, and side ST is opposite angle at Q. 

Wait, in triangle SQT:

- Vertex Q: angle at Q is ∠SQT = 106°
- Vertex T: angle at T is ?
- Vertex S: angle at S is ?

Since sides QT and ST are equal (radii), then the angles opposite them are equal. The side opposite ∠SQT is ST. The side opposite ∠QST is QT. Wait, no. Let me clarify:

- Side opposite ∠SQT (at Q) is ST.
- Side opposite ∠QST (at S) is QT.
- Side opposite ∠QTS (at T) is QS.

Since QT and ST are both radii, so QT = ST. Therefore, the sides opposite ∠SQT and ∠QST are equal. Wait, no: side opposite ∠SQT is ST, which is equal to QT. So, if QT = ST, then the sides opposite angles at Q and S are equal. Therefore, ∠SQT = ∠QST. 

Wait, no. If side opposite ∠SQT is ST, and side opposite ∠QST is QT. If ST = QT, then ∠SQT = ∠QST. 

But ∠SQT is given as 106°, so ∠QST would also be 106°, which would make the sum of angles in triangle SQT as 106 + 106 + ∠QTS = 180. So, ∠QTS = 180 - 2*106 = 180 - 212 = -32°, which is impossible. 

This indicates a contradiction, suggesting that our assumption that S is on the circle is wrong. 

Therefore, S is not on the circle. Hence, ST is not a radius. 

This complicates things. So, S is not on the circle, which means that line ST is not a radius. 

Therefore, triangle SQT has sides QT (radius) and ST (unknown), and QS (unknown). 

But we still know one angle: ∠SQT = 106°. Without more info, it's difficult to proceed. 

Let me try to consider other angles. 

We have ∠ARS = 71°, at point R. Since RA is tangent at A, and S is some point. Let's consider triangle ARS. In this triangle, angle at R is 71°, and we might relate it to other parts. 

Since RA is tangent at A, then TA ⊥ RA. So, in triangle RAT, angle at A is 90°. 

If we can find some relation between triangles ARS and RAT, perhaps via angles. 

Let me consider extending lines or finding other angles. 

Let me also recall that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. But since we don't have inscribed angles yet, this might not help directly. 

Alternatively, considering the angles involving point C and point R. 

We have angle ∠QCA, which is at C between Q and A. Also, line CQ is tangent at Q, and line RA is tangent at A. 

Perhaps there's a way to relate these angles through the diagram. 

Let me try to summarize what we know:

1. T is the center of the circle.
2. Q and A are points on the circle.
3. CQ is tangent at Q → TQ ⊥ CQ.
4. RA is tangent at A → TA ⊥ RA.
5. ∠QRS = 71° (wait, original was ∠ARS = 71°).
6. ∠SQT = 106°.
7. Need to find measure of arc QTS.

Since T is the center, and Q is on the circle, let's focus on ∠SQT = 106°. This angle is at Q, between points S, Q, T. So, this is an angle formed by the line QS and the radius QT. 

If we can find the measure of ∠SQT, which is given as 106°, and relate it to the arc. But how?

Wait, if we consider the angle between a tangent and a chord, but here it's between a line QS (not necessarily tangent) and a radius. 

Alternatively, if we consider triangle SQT, and try to relate it to other elements. 

But without knowing more about the triangle, it's challenging. 

Let me think about the other angle: ∠ARS = 71°. Let's analyze this. 

Point R is connected to A and S. Since RA is tangent at A, and angle at R is 71°, maybe we can use the fact that in triangle ARS, we can relate it to other parts. 

Also, since RA is tangent at A, and T is the center, then TA ⊥ RA. So, if we draw TA, it forms a right angle with RA. 

Let me consider drawing TA and RA. Since RA is tangent at A, TA ⊥ RA. So, angle between TA and RA is 90°. 

If we can find some relationship between triangle ARS and triangle TAR, perhaps through angles. 

Let me denote some variables. Let's call ∠ARS = 71°, which is at R. In triangle ARS, angles are at A, R, S. 

But we don't know the other angles. However, if we can express them in terms of other known quantities. 

For example, in triangle TAR, we know that ∠TAR = 90°, as TA ⊥ RA. 

If we can relate ∠TAR to ∠ARS, perhaps through some shared angles or lines. 

Wait, if we extend line SR to meet some other element, or if there's a common angle. 

Alternatively, consider that points S and C might be related. 

Given the complexity, perhaps it's time to look for another approach. 

Let me recall that the measure of an arc is equal to the measure of the central angle subtending it. If we can find the central angle corresponding to arc QTS, that would be our answer. 

But to find that angle, we need to find ∠QTS, which is the angle at T between Q and S. 

If we can find ∠QTS, then that would give us the measure of arc QS. But the question asks for arc QTS, which might be the same as arc QS. 

So, let's focus on finding ∠QTS. 

To find ∠QTS, let's consider triangle SQT. We know angle at Q is 106°, and if we can find another angle, we can find the third. 

Let me consider if there's a way to relate ∠QTS to other parts. 

Since T is the center, and Q is on the circle, then TQ is a radius. Also, if S is outside the circle, then QS is a secant or tangent. 

But without knowing where S is, it's hard to say. 

Wait, let's consider the possibility that S lies on the tangent line from T to some point. Or maybe S is the intersection of two lines. 

Alternatively, since we have two tangent lines: CQ and RA, maybe S is the intersection of lines CQ and RA? Let's check. 

If S is the intersection of CQ and RA, then we'd have point S at the intersection of these two tangent lines. 

Let me explore this possibility. 

Assume that S is the intersection of lines CQ and RA. Then, S is a point where the two tangents meet. 

If that's the case, then we can consider triangle SQR or other triangles. 

But how does this help with the given angles? 

Let me consider this scenario: S is the intersection of CQ and RA. So, lines CQ and RA meet at S. 

Then, in this case, we have point S such that S is on both CQ and RA. 

Given that, let's examine the given angles. 

Angle ∠ARS = 71°, which would be at point R, between A and S. Since S is on RA, this angle would be zero, which doesn't make sense. So, this suggests that S is not on RA. 

Therefore, S is not on RA. Hence, my assumption is incorrect. 

Alternatively, S could be on another line. 

Let me think differently. Since we have two tangent lines, CQ and RA, and we have angles involving S. Maybe S is another point related to these tangents. 

Alternatively, consider that line ST is related to the circle. Since T is the center, and if S is outside the circle, then ST is a line from the center to S. 

But without more info, it's challenging. 

Let me try to use the given angles. 

We know ∠SQT = 106°, and ∠ARS = 71°. 

Let me consider the entire diagram. Points Q and A are on the circle, T is the center. Lines CQ and RA are tangents at Q and A respectively. Points R and C are external points. S is another point, forming angles with Q, R, and T. 

Maybe there's a cyclic quadrilateral or some triangle relationships. 

Let me try to consider the angles at Q and R. 

At point Q, we have angle ∠SQT = 106°, and also angle between CQ and QA (from the tangent and chord). 

Earlier, I recalled the Alternate Segment Theorem, which states that the angle between the tangent and the chord is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. 

Applying this at point Q, the angle between tangent CQ and chord QA is equal to the angle subtended by QA in the alternate segment. 

Let me calculate that. 

Let ∠CQA = x (the angle between tangent CQ and chord QA). According to the Alternate Segment Theorem, this x is equal to the angle subtended by QA in the alternate segment. 

Let's say that angle is ∠QAT, since T is the center. Wait, no. The alternate segment would be the arc QA not containing the tangent point Q. The angle subtended by QA in the alternate segment would be an inscribed angle. 

Let me denote the angle subtended by QA in the alternate segment as y. Then, x = y. 

But since T is the center, the angle subtended by QA at the center is ∠QTA, which is twice the inscribed angle. So, if y is the inscribed angle, then ∠QTA = 2y. 

But we don't know y, but if we can relate it to other angles. 

However, without knowing x or y, this might not help directly. 

But let's try to find x. 

In triangle QCA, we have angle at C is ∠QCA, angle at Q is x, and angle at A is ∠QAC. Sum of angles is 180°. 

But we don't know any of these angles. 

However, if we can relate ∠QAC to other parts. 

Since A is on the circle, and TA is a radius, and RA is tangent at A, so TA ⊥ RA. 

So, in triangle TAR, ∠TAR = 90°, and RA is tangent. 

If we can find ∠QAC, which is part of triangle QCA, and relate it to other angles. 

Alternatively, since QA is a chord, and TA is a radius, then ∠QTA is the central angle for arc QA. 

Let me denote ∠QTA = α. Then, the inscribed angle subtended by QA would be α/2. 

According to the Alternate Segment Theorem, x = α/2. 

So, x = α/2. 

But α is ∠QTA, which is the central angle. 

Now, let's try to find α. 

How? 

If we can relate α to other angles. 

For example, if we can find ∠QCA or ∠QAC. 

But I don't have enough information. 

Let me think about the other given angle: ∠ARS = 71°. 

At point R, between A and S. Since RA is tangent at A, and S is some point. Let me assume that S is on the line extending from some other tangent or secant. 

Alternatively, consider triangle ARS. In this triangle, ∠ARS = 71°, and we might relate it to other angles. 

Since RA is tangent at A, and if we can find some relationship between this triangle and the circle. 

But without knowing where S is, it's hard to say. 

Maybe it's time to consider combining all the given information. 

We have two tangent lines: CQ and RA. Their points of tangency are Q and A. 

Lines CQ and RA are tangents, so they meet at some external point. Let's call this point S. Wait, but the angle ∠ARS is given, so if S is the intersection point of CQ and RA, then S is the external point from which two tangents are drawn to the circle. 

Wait, this is a crucial insight! If S is the intersection of lines CQ and RA, then S is the external point from which two tangents are drawn to the circle: CQ and RA. 

But wait, CQ is one tangent, and RA is another tangent. If S is the intersection of these two lines, then S is the external point. 

But in that case, the two tangent lines from S to the circle would be SQ and SA, but in our case, the tangents are CQ and RA. Wait, but if S is the intersection of CQ and RA, then line SCQ is one tangent, and line SRA is another tangent. 

But in this case, the tangent lines from S to the circle would be SQ and SA. Wait, but SQ is part of line CQ, which is already tangent at Q. Similarly, SA is part of line RA, which is tangent at A. 

Thus, S is the external point from which two tangents SQ and SA are drawn to the circle, touching at Q and A respectively. 

This makes sense! So, S is the external point from which two tangents SQ and SA are drawn to the circle, touching at Q and A. 

This is a key realization. 

Now, with this understanding, let's proceed. 

So, S is the intersection of lines CQ and RA. 

Now, since S is the external point from which tangents SQ and SA are drawn to the circle, we can use properties of tangents from a common external point. 

One such property is that the lengths of the tangents from S to the circle are equal. So, SQ = SA. 

Also, the line joining the external point S to the center T bisects the angle between the two tangents. So, ST bisects ∠ASQ. 

Additionally, the line ST is perpendicular to the polar of S with respect to the circle, but that might not be helpful here. 

Now, let's consider triangle ASQ. It is an isoceles triangle with SA = SQ, and ST is the bisector of ∠ASQ. 

But we also have given angles. 

Let me consider the angles at S. 

In triangle ASQ, since SA = SQ, the base angles are equal. Let's denote ∠SAQ = ∠SQA. 

But we also have ∠SQT = 106°, which is at Q, between S, Q, T. 

Let me try to relate this. 

Since ST is the bisector of ∠ASQ, and T is the center. 

Let me denote ∠ASQ as β. Then, each of the angles ∠SQA and ∠SAQ is β/2. 

But we also have ∠SQT = 106°, which is part of ∠SQA. 

Wait, ∠SQA is part of the angle at Q between S and A. But ∠SQT is the angle between S and T at Q. 

So, ∠SQT is part of ∠SQA. 

Let me visualize this. At point Q, we have lines QS and QA. The angle between them is ∠SQA. Also, from Q, there is a line QT (radius) to the center T. The angle between QS and QT is ∠SQT = 106°, and the angle between QT and QA is ∠TQA. 

So, ∠SQA = ∠SQT + ∠TQA. 

But ∠TQA is the angle between QT (radius) and QA (chord). 

From the Alternate Segment Theorem, this angle ∠TQA is equal to the angle between tangent QA and chord AQ, which is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. Wait, no. Wait, the angle between tangent and chord is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. 

But here, at point Q, the tangent is CQ, and the chord is QA. So, the angle between tangent CQ and chord QA is ∠CQA, which is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. 

But we also have ∠TQA, which is the angle between radius QT and chord QA. 

Wait, let me clarify. 

The angle between the tangent CQ and the chord QA is ∠CQA. This is equal to the angle in the alternate segment, which would be the angle subtended by QA at the circumference in the alternate segment. 

Let me call this angle γ. So, ∠CQA = γ. 

On the other hand, the angle between the radius QT and the chord QA is ∠TQA. 

Since QT is a radius, and QA is a chord, the angle ∠TQA is related to the arc QA. Specifically, the central angle ∠QTA is twice the inscribed angle subtended by QA. 

But how does this relate to ∠TQA? 

Actually, ∠TQA is not a standard angle, but it's part of triangle TQA.
