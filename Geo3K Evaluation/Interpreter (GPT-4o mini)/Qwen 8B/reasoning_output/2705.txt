Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we need to find the value of y such that the quadrilateral ABCD is a parallelogram. The given predicates involve angles at different vertices, and they're expressed in terms of x and y. 

First, I remember that in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. Also, consecutive angles are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. Since the problem mentions that ABCD is a parallelogram, these properties should hold true here.

Let me list out the given angle measures:

- Angle at B-A-D (which is angle BAD) is 5x - 19.
- Angle at A-B-C (angle ABC) is 6y - 57.
- Angle at D-C-B (angle DCB) is 3x + 9.
- Angle at C-D-A (angle CDA) is 3y + 36.

Wait, since it's a parallelogram, opposite angles should be equal. Let me visualize the parallelogram ABCD. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are parallel, so angle BAD should be equal to angle BCD, and angle ABC should equal angle ADC. Wait, but the labels might differ. Let me make sure about the notation.

In a parallelogram ABCD, the order of the letters matters. So, the vertices are connected as A-B-C-D-A. Therefore, angle BAD is at vertex A, between BA and AD. Then angle ABC is at vertex B, between AB and BC. Similarly, angle BCD is at vertex C, between BC and CD, and angle CDA is at vertex D, between CD and DA.

So, in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. That means angle BAD equals angle BCD, and angle ABC equals angle ADC. Also, consecutive angles are supplementary. For example, angle BAD + angle ABC = 180 degrees because they are adjacent.

Looking at the given expressions:

Angle BAD = 5x - 19. This should be equal to angle BCD, which is given as 3x + 9. Because in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So setting them equal:

5x - 19 = 3x + 9.

Solving this equation:

Subtract 3x from both sides: 2x -19 = 9

Add 19 to both sides: 2x = 28 → x = 14.

Alright, so x is 14. Now, let's check if that holds. But wait, also, since consecutive angles are supplementary, angle BAD + angle ABC should equal 180 degrees. Let me verify that once we have x and y.

But first, let's look at the other pair of opposite angles. Angle ABC is 6y - 57, and angle ADC is 3y + 36. Since they are opposite angles in a parallelogram, they should be equal. Therefore:

6y - 57 = 3y + 36.

Solving this:

Subtract 3y from both sides: 3y -57 = 36

Add 57 to both sides: 3y = 93 → y = 31.

Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me confirm if this is consistent with the other equations. However, maybe there's more to check here. Let me see if substituting x=14 and y=31 satisfies all conditions.

First, compute angle BAD: 5x -19. With x=14, that's 5*14=70 -19=51 degrees.

Angle BCD is 3x +9. 3*14=42 +9=51. So yes, those are equal. Good.

Now, angle ABC is 6y -57. If y=31, that's 6*31=186 -57=129 degrees.

Angle ADC is 3y +36. 3*31=93 +36=129. So those are equal too. Perfect.

But also, consecutive angles should add up to 180. Let's check angle BAD + angle ABC. 51 + 129 = 180. Yes, that works. Similarly, angle ABC + angle BCD would be 129 +51=180. Wait, angle BCD is 51? No, angle BCD was equal to angle BAD, which is 51. So angle ABC (129) plus angle BCD (51) is 180. Correct.

Alternatively, angle ADC is 129, and angle DAB is 51, adding to 180. All good.

Therefore, y=31. Looking at the options, A is 31. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me check if there's another way this could be approached, just to be thorough. Maybe using another property?

Another thought: In a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. So, angle BAD and angle ABC are adjacent, so their sum is 180. We found x=14 gives angle BAD=51, angle ABC=129. Sum is 180. So that checks out.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a case where we need to use more than one equation? Suppose we didn't notice that opposite angles are equal, but instead used the fact that consecutive angles are supplementary. Let me try that approach.

For instance, angle BAD + angle ABC = 180. So:

(5x -19) + (6y -57) = 180.

Also, angle ABC + angle BCD = 180. Since angle BCD is 3x +9, so:

(6y -57) + (3x +9) = 180.

But we already have two equations here:

Equation 1: 5x -19 + 6y -57 = 180 → 5x +6y = 180 + 76 = 256.

Equation 2: 6y -57 +3x +9 = 180 → 3x +6y = 180 + 48 = 228.

Then, subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1:

(5x +6y) - (3x +6y) = 256 - 228 → 2x = 28 → x=14. Which matches our previous result. Then plugging back x=14 into Equation 2: 3*14 +6y =228 → 42 +6y=228 → 6y=186 → y=31. Same result. So that confirms y=31 again.

Thus, regardless of the method, we get y=31. Therefore, the correct answer is A.
