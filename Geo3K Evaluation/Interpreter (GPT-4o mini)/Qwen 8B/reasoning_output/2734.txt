MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. Since there's no image provided, I need to make some assumptions based on common problems that often have answer choices like these. The question asks to find x with options 30, 60, 90, 120. Let me think of typical scenarios where such angles appear.

Maybe it's a triangle problem. For example, if we have an equilateral triangle, all angles are 60 degrees. Or maybe a right triangle with some angles involved. Alternatively, could it involve a regular hexagon? In a regular hexagon, each internal angle is 120 degrees. But how would that relate to finding x?

Another possibility is a circle problem. Inscribed angles or central angles. For instance, if an inscribed angle subtends an arc of 60 degrees, the angle itself would be half that, so 30 degrees. Or if there's a triangle inscribed in a semicircle, making a right angle, but that's 90 degrees. Wait, but the answer choices include 120, which is also possible if dealing with arcs larger than a semicircle.

Alternatively, maybe it's about supplementary angles. If two angles form a straight line, they add up to 180. So if one angle is 60, the other is 120. But again, without more info, it's tricky.

Wait, perhaps it's a classic problem involving an isosceles triangle. Suppose there's a triangle with two equal sides, leading to base angles being equal. If one angle is given, others can be found. For example, if the apex angle is 60, then the base angles are (180-60)/2 = 60, making it equilateral. But then all angles are 60, so x would be 60. That fits option B.

But another scenario: suppose there's a transversal cutting through parallel lines, creating corresponding angles. If one angle is 30, then the corresponding angle is also 30. But again, depends on setup.

Alternatively, maybe it's about exterior angles. In a polygon, the sum of exterior angles is 360. If it's a regular polygon, each exterior angle is 360/n. For example, a hexagon has exterior angles of 60, but that's not matching the options unless considering something else.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a triangle with certain bisectors. Like, if an angle bisector divides an angle into two parts. Suppose we have an angle of 120 degrees, split into two 60s. Then x could be 60. Or if there's a 30-60-90 triangle, which is common. In such a triangle, angles are 30, 60, 90. So if x is one of those, it could be 30, 60, or 90.

Since the answer choices are 30, 60, 90, 120, maybe the problem involves a triangle with angles adding up to 180. For example, if two angles are known, the third can be found. But without specifics, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, think of a cyclic quadrilateral. Opposite angles sum to 180. If one angle is 120, opposite is 60. So x could be 60. Or if adjacent angles are supplementary.

Wait, another common problem: in a triangle, if a median or altitude creates certain angles. For example, in an equilateral triangle, medians are also altitudes and angle bisectors, creating 30-degree angles if extended. Hmm.

Alternatively, consider a square with diagonals. Diagonals intersect at 90 degrees, but each diagonal splits the square into 45-45-90 triangles. Not sure how that connects.

Wait, maybe the problem is about an inscribed angle in a circle. If the central angle is twice the inscribed angle. For example, if the central angle is 120 degrees, the inscribed angle would be 60. So x could be 60. Or vice versa.

Alternatively, if there's a triangle inscribed in a circle where one side is the diameter. Then the angle opposite that side is a right angle (Thales' theorem). So if the triangle is right-angled, and other angles... For example, if one angle is 90, and another is 30, then the third is 60. So x could be 30, 60, or 90.

Given the answer choices, and common problems, the most likely scenarios are either a 30-60-90 triangle, an equilateral triangle (all 60), or an inscribed angle related to a central angle. Without the exact problem setup, it's challenging, but since the options include 60 and 120, which are common in such contexts.

Assuming the problem is about an inscribed angle: if the central angle is 120, then the inscribed angle would be half that, 60. Therefore, x=60. Alternatively, if the inscribed angle is 60, the central angle is 120. Depending on which angle is asked.

Or maybe it's about a triangle with angles in a ratio. For instance, if angles are in ratio 1:2:3, then they are 30, 60, 90. So x could be any of them. 

But since the answer choices are four, and the user expects one of them, perhaps the standard problem is a 30-60-90 triangle where x is 60. Or maybe a different configuration.

Alternatively, if there's an isosceles triangle with vertex angle 120, then the base angles would be (180-120)/2 = 30. So x could be 30. 

Hmm. Given that, but without knowing the exact setup, it's ambiguous. However, since the options are present, and common problems often use these angles, I'll assume that the intended answer is 60 degrees, as it appears in many standard configurations like the inscribed angle vs central angle, or in 30-60-90 triangles. Therefore, the answer is B.
