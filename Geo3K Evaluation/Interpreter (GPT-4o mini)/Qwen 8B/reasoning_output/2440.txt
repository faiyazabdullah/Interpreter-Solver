MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given information carefully. 

We have points A, B, C, D, E, F, G. There are several lines connecting them: AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FB, GD. Also, there are some length equalities and angle measures. The main question is about finding the measure of angle ADC. But wait, the problem also mentions polygons ABCD and AEFG being similar, with some specific angles and sides given. Let me jot down all the given data first.

Starting with the given predicates:

- Points A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
- Lines AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FB, GD.
- Lengths:
  - AB = 26
  - FE = 8 (since Line(F,E) has length 8)
  - DF = 5? Wait, the predicate says Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,F)), 5). So DF is 5 units?
Wait, but later in the question part, it says GF = 14, AD = 12, DG = 4.5, EF = 8, AB = 26. Hmm, maybe some of these are different? Wait, the initial predicates may conflict with the question's parameters. Let me check again.

Wait, the original problem gives some initial predicates and then the question adds more conditions. Let me re-examine.

Original Predicates:

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), 26)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,E)), 8)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,F)), 14)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,G)), 12)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(G,D)), 4)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,D)), 5)
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(G,D,A)), 108)

Then the question states:

"Polygon A B C D ∼ polygon A E F G, m∠AGF=108, GF=14, AD=12, DG=4.5, EF=8, and AB=26. Find m∠ADC."

Wait, so there seems to be conflicting information here. For example, in the initial predicates, Line(D,F) has length 14, but in the question, they mention GF=14. Also, Line(G,D) has length 4 according to the initial predicates, but in the question, DG=4.5. This suggests that perhaps the initial predicates are part of a diagram, and the question is adding new conditions. Maybe the initial predicates are part of a setup, and the question is giving additional info?

Alternatively, maybe there was a typo or confusion. Let me try to reconcile these.

First, focus on the question part since it includes the specific elements needed for the problem. The problem says:

Polygons ABCD ~ AEF G (I think it's supposed to be AEF G, maybe AEGF?), with similarity ratio. Given m∠AGF = 108°, GF = 14, AD = 12, DG = 4.5, EF = 8, AB = 26. Need to find m∠ADC.

So the key here is that ABCD is similar to AEFG. Let's note that similarity implies corresponding angles are equal and sides are proportional.

Let me try to map the correspondence between the two polygons. Since the similarity is written as ABCD ∼ AEF G, assuming the order of vertices corresponds. So:

A corresponds to A,
B corresponds to E,
C corresponds to F,
D corresponds to G.

Wait, because the second polygon is AEF G. So if ABCD ~ AEF G, then the order would be A→A, B→E, C→F, D→G. Therefore, the similarity transformation maps ABCD to AEF G.

Therefore, corresponding sides:

AB corresponds to AE,
BC corresponds to EF,
CD corresponds to FG,
DA corresponds to GA.

But wait, the problem says GF=14. In the second polygon, the side FG would correspond to CD in the first polygon. So CD corresponds to FG. Hence, CD / FG = AB / AE.

But we know AB = 26, and EF = 8. Wait, EF is part of the second polygon. Let me think.

Since ABCD ~ AEF G, then the ratios of corresponding sides should be equal. Let's list the sides:

In ABCD: AB, BC, CD, DA.

In AEF G: AE, EF, FG, GA.

So AB corresponds to AE,

BC corresponds to EF,

CD corresponds to FG,

DA corresponds to GA.

Given that, and knowing that EF = 8 (from the question), which is BC in the first polygon. Because BC corresponds to EF. So BC / EF = AB / AE. Wait, but BC is part of the first polygon. However, we don't know BC directly unless we can compute it.

But wait, in the initial predicates, there were some lengths. Let me check again. The initial predicates had:

- Length of AB is 26 (given),
- Length of FE (which is EF) is 8,
- Length of DF is 5 (but this might not be relevant anymore),
- Length of DG is 4 (initially), but in the question, DG is 4.5. So there's inconsistency here. Perhaps the initial predicates are part of a diagram, but the question overrides some values? Or maybe I need to use the question's parameters.

Since the problem statement says "Find m∠ADC", and gives specific values like GF=14, AD=12, DG=4.5, EF=8, AB=26. So probably the initial predicates are not all applicable, and the question provides updated values. So I should rely on the question's given data.

So focusing on the question's parameters:

Polygons ABCD ~ AEF G (assuming AEF G is a quadrilateral, maybe A-E-F-G-A). Then:

Corresponding angles: Each angle in ABCD corresponds to the same angle in AEF G. So ∠ABC corresponds to ∠AEF, ∠BCD corresponds to ∠EFG, etc. But the question mentions m∠AGF = 108°. So point G is part of the second polygon AEF G, so AGF is an angle at point G between points A, G, F. So ∠AGF is part of polygon AEF G.

Also, given GF = 14 (so FG = 14), AD = 12, DG = 4.5, EF = 8, AB = 26. Need to find m∠ADC.

Since ABCD is similar to AEF G, the ratio of similarity can be determined by comparing corresponding sides.

Let me find the ratio of similarity between ABCD and AEF G.

From the similarity, AB corresponds to AE, BC corresponds to EF, CD corresponds to FG, DA corresponds to GA.

We know AB = 26, and EF = 8. So the ratio of AB to EF is 26 / 8 = 13 / 4. Therefore, the ratio of similarity is 13:4. That means each side of ABCD is 13/4 times the corresponding side in AEF G.

Now, CD corresponds to FG. We know FG = 14 (GF=14). Therefore, CD = (13/4)*FG = (13/4)*14 = (13*14)/4 = 182/4 = 45.5. But we don't know CD yet. Alternatively, since DA corresponds to GA. DA is given as 12. So GA = (4/13)*DA = (4/13)*12 = 48/13 ≈ 3.69. Not sure if helpful yet.

But how does this help us find angle ADC?

Angle ADC is an angle in polygon ABCD. Since ABCD ~ AEF G, the corresponding angle in AEF G would be ∠AGF, which is given as 108 degrees. Wait, ∠AGF is in the second polygon. Let me check the correspondence.

In polygon ABCD, angle ADC is at vertex D. In the similar polygon AEF G, which angle corresponds to angle ADC? Let's see:

Vertex D in ABCD corresponds to vertex G in AEF G. So angle ADC corresponds to angle AGF. Because in ABCD, angle at D is between points A-D-C. In AEF G, the corresponding angle at G would be between points A-G-F. So yes, ∠ADC corresponds to ∠AGF. Therefore, since they're similar, their measures are equal. Thus, m∠ADC = m∠AGF = 108°. But wait, that would make the answer C. But let me verify.

Wait, but the problem says "m∠AGF = 108". So if ∠ADC corresponds to ∠AGF, then they are equal. Therefore, the answer is 108, which is option C.

But let me double-check the correspondence. Let me write down the correspondence of vertices:

ABCD ~ AEF G → A→A, B→E, C→F, D→G.

Thus, angle at D in ABCD (∠ADC) corresponds to angle at G in AEF G (∠AGF). Therefore, they are equal. So m∠ADC = m∠AGF = 108°, so answer is C.

But why is the question providing other details like AD=12, DG=4.5, EF=8, etc.? Maybe to confirm the similarity ratio or check for consistency?

For instance, DA corresponds to GA in the similar polygons. DA is given as 12, so GA = (4/13)*DA = 4/13 * 12 = 48/13 ≈ 3.69. But DG is given as 4.5. Is there a relation between DG and other parts?

Wait, DG is a segment from D to G. In the original diagram, there's a line GD (from the initial predicates). But in the question's parameters, DG = 4.5. How does this relate?

Perhaps DG is part of triangle DGA or something else. But since the problem states that ABCD ~ AEF G, and DG is given as 4.5, but in the similar polygon, GA is 48/13 ≈ 3.69. But DG isn't necessarily a corresponding side. Maybe DG is part of another triangle?

Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the correspondence. Let me check again.

If ABCD ~ AEF G, then the sides:

AB corresponds to AE,

BC corresponds to EF,

CD corresponds to FG,

DA corresponds to GA.

So DA corresponds to GA. Therefore, DA/GA = AB/AE = BC/EF = CD/FG.

Given DA = 12, so GA = (DA * AE)/AB. Wait, but we don't know AE. However, EF is given as 8. Since BC corresponds to EF, BC = (AB / AE) * EF. But without knowing BC or AE, this might not help directly.

However, since the problem gives DG = 4.5. What is DG? It's the distance between D and G. In the original figure, there's a line GD (from initial predicates), but in the question's terms, DG is 4.5. How does this fit in?

Maybe DG is part of triangle DGA or another triangle. But since ABCD ~ AEF G, and D corresponds to G, maybe considering triangle DGA?

But I'm getting confused. However, earlier conclusion was that angle ADC corresponds to angle AGF, hence 108°, making answer C. But let me check if that's valid.

Another way: Since the polygons are similar, their angles are equal. Therefore, regardless of the side lengths, the measure of angle ADC equals the measure of its corresponding angle in the other polygon, which is ∠AGF. Therefore, answer is C.

But why is the problem giving DG=4.5 and other lengths? Maybe to test if the student gets distracted by extra info. For example, someone might think they need to calculate using those lengths, but actually, the angle correspondence is sufficient.

Alternatively, perhaps there's an error in my assumption about the correspondence. Let me confirm the order of the similarity.

The similarity is ABCD ~ AEF G. So the order of the letters indicates the correspondence. So:

A → A,

B → E,

C → F,

D → G.

Therefore, the angles:

At A: ∠BAD corresponds to ∠EAF,

At B: ∠ABC corresponds to ∠AEF,

At C: ∠BCD corresponds to ∠EFG,

At D: ∠CDA corresponds to ∠FGA (which is ∠AGF).

Yes, ∠CDA (angle ADC) corresponds to ∠FGA (at point G between F, G, A), which is ∠AGF. So they are equal. Therefore, m∠ADC = 108°, so answer is C.

Hence, the answer is C.
