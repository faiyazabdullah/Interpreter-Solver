MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to make sure I understand the given information and what's being asked. 

So, the problem says that vectors QP and QR are opposite rays. That means they form a straight line, right? So points P, Q, and R are colinear with Q between P and R. Wait, but since they're opposite rays, it should be that QP and QR are in opposite directions. So if I imagine point Q, then QP goes one way and QR goes the other. Therefore, P, Q, R are colinear with Q as the midpoint between P and R? Or maybe not necessarily the midpoint, just that Q is between them. But since they are opposite rays, that would mean that PR is a straight line passing through Q.

Next, there's another part about QT bisecting angle SQ R. So angle SQR is being bisected by QT. Let me visualize this. Point Q is connected to S and R, forming angle SQR. Then QT is the bisector of that angle. Also, we have some points mentioned like S, T, and others. Wait, the problem mentions several points: P, Q, R, S, T. Lines PQ, QR, QS, QT. Angles at Q: SQT, PQR, and also SQR. Hmm.

Given that m∠SQR is 6x + 8, and m∠TQR is 4x - 14. We need to find m∠SQT. 

Let me recall that angle bisectors split the angle into two equal parts. Since QT bisects ∠SQR, then ∠SQT and ∠TQR should each be half of ∠SQR. Wait, but wait—no. Wait, the angle being bisected is ∠SQR. So if QT is the bisector, then ∠SQR is split into two angles: ∠SQ T and ∠TQR. So those two angles should add up to ∠SQR. And because it's a bisector, they should be equal. Wait, but the problem gives expressions for both ∠SQR and ∠TQR. Wait, hold on. Wait, m∠SQR is given as 6x +8, and m∠TQR is given as 4x -14. But if QT bisects ∠SQR, then ∠TQR should be half of ∠SQR. Wait, unless I'm misunderstanding the angle names here.

Wait, let me clarify the notation. The angle ∠SQR is the angle at vertex Q between points S and R. So points S, Q, R. Then QT is a ray starting at Q and going towards T. So if QT bisects ∠SQR, then ∠SQT and ∠TQR would be the two angles formed by the bisector. So ∠SQT is one part, ∠TQR is the other. Since QT bisects ∠SQR, these two angles should be equal. Therefore, ∠SQT = ∠TQR. But according to the problem, m∠SQR is 6x +8, so the sum of ∠SQT and ∠TQR is 6x +8. But since they are equal, each would be (6x +8)/2. However, the problem states that m∠TQR is 4x -14. Therefore, setting (6x+8)/2 equal to 4x -14. Solving this equation for x would give us the value of x, which we could then plug back into either expression to find the measure of ∠TQR or ∠SQT. But wait, the question asks for m∠SQT. Since ∠SQT equals ∠TQR, then once we find x, we can compute either. Alternatively, perhaps there's more to it?

But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. If QT bisects ∠SQR, then ∠SQT and ∠TQR are equal. Therefore, ∠SQT = ∠TQR = (m∠SQR)/2. But the problem gives m∠SQR as 6x +8, and m∠TQR as 4x -14. Therefore, since ∠TQR is half of ∠SQR, then:

4x -14 = (6x +8)/2

Multiply both sides by 2:

8x -28 = 6x +8

Subtract 6x from both sides:

2x -28 = 8

Add 28 to both sides:

2x = 36

Divide by 2:

x = 18

Then, substituting x=18 into m∠TQR = 4x -14 gives 4*18 -14 = 72 -14 = 58. But wait, if ∠TQR is 58 degrees, then ∠SQT would also be 58 degrees, since they are equal. But wait, the question asks for m∠SQT. So the answer would be 58, which corresponds to choice D. But let me verify again.

Alternatively, perhaps I got confused with the angle labels. Maybe ∠SQT isn't equal to ∠TQR? Let me think again. The angle ∠SQR is the entire angle at Q between S and R. When QT bisects that angle, it splits it into two angles: ∠SQT and ∠TQR. So yes, they should be equal. Therefore, their measures are equal. Hence, 4x -14 equals half of (6x +8). Which leads to x=18, making ∠TQR=58. Thus, ∠SQT is also 58. So the answer would be D. But let me check if there's something wrong here.

Wait, but maybe the problem has a typo or my understanding is incorrect. Let me re-examine the problem statement. It says "QT bisects ∠SQR". So ∠SQR is split into ∠SQT and ∠TQR. So yes, those two angles are equal. Therefore, the equations above are correct. So solving gives x=18, leading to m∠SQT = 58. So answer D. But let me check again the options. The answer choices are A.18, B.32, C.36, D.58. So D is 58. But let me check if there's another possibility.

Wait, perhaps there's a different interpretation. Suppose that ∠SQR is being bisected by QT, so that ∠SQT is one part and ∠TQR is the other. But maybe the problem uses different notation. For example, maybe ∠TQR is not the same as the other part. Wait, if QT is the bisector, then ∠SQT and ∠TQR are equal. Therefore, m∠SQT = m∠TQR. Therefore, equate them. But according to the problem, m∠SQR = 6x +8, which is the total angle, so m∠SQT + m∠TQR = 6x +8. But since they are equal, each is (6x +8)/2. But the problem says m∠TQR = 4x -14. Therefore, set (6x +8)/2 = 4x -14. Solve for x. As before, which gives x=18, leading to m∠TQR=58. Therefore, m∠SQT is also 58. So answer D. However, maybe the problem expects me to calculate m∠SQT directly? Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the angle measures. Let me check again. The problem says m∠SQR = 6x +8, and m∠TQR = 4x -14. If QT bisects ∠SQR, then ∠TQR is half of ∠SQR. Wait, no—if the angle is being bisected, then each of the two new angles is half of the original. Therefore, ∠TQR = (∠SQR)/2. So:

4x -14 = (6x +8)/2 → 8x -28 = 6x +8 → 2x = 36 → x=18. Then, m∠TQR = 4(18) -14 = 72 -14 = 58. Therefore, since ∠SQT = ∠TQR, then m∠SQT is also 58. Therefore, answer D. But let me check if there's another way this could be approached.

Wait, another thought: Could there be an error in assuming that ∠SQT and ∠TQR are equal? Let me confirm. If QT is the bisector of ∠SQR, then it divides ∠SQR into two equal angles. So ∠SQT and ∠TQR are adjacent angles forming ∠SQR. So yes, they are equal. Therefore, my previous calculation holds. Therefore, the answer should be D. But let me check if there's a different interpretation. For instance, maybe the angle being bisected is different. Let me look again at the problem statement.

The problem states: "QT bisects ∠SQR." So ∠SQR is the angle at Q between points S and R. So the bisector QT splits that angle into two equal parts. Therefore, the two angles formed are ∠SQT and ∠TQR. Therefore, their measures are equal. So the setup is correct. Therefore, solving gives x=18, leading to m∠SQT = 58. So answer D. 

Therefore, the correct answer is D.
