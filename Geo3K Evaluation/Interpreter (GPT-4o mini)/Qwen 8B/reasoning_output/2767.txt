Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, C, D all lying on a circle with center O. The angles given are angle ABC measuring 65 degrees and angle CBD measuring 132 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle ABD, which is labeled as x.

First, since all points are on a circle, maybe there's something about cyclic quadrilaterals or inscribed angles here. Wait, but the points are A, B, C, D on a circle. Let me visualize this. Points A, B, C, D are on the circumference of the same circle. So, they form a quadrilateral? Or maybe some intersecting chords?

Looking at the angles given: angle ABC is at point B, between points A and C. Then angle CBD is also at point B, between points C and D. So, those two angles share the side BC. So, if I imagine point B connected to A, C, and D, forming angles at B. So, angle ABC is part of triangle ABC, and angle CBD is part of triangle CBD. But since all points are on a circle, perhaps these angles relate to arcs on the circle?

Inscribed angles relate to the arcs they subtend. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So, angle ABC intercepts arc AC. Similarly, angle CBD intercepts arc CD. Wait, but angle ABC is formed by chords BA and BC, so it intercepts arc AC. Similarly, angle CBD is formed by chords CB and BD, intercepting arc CD. 

So, if angle ABC is 65°, then the arc AC would be 2*65 = 130°. Similarly, angle CBD is 132°, so arc CD would be 2*132 = 264°? Wait, but arcs can't be more than 360°, but 264° seems possible. However, wait, in a circle, the sum of arcs around the circle is 360°, so if arc AC is 130°, and arc CD is 264°, adding them gives 394°, which is impossible. That suggests that maybe my assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting which arcs the angles intercept. Let me think again. For an inscribed angle, the angle is half the measure of the arc that it intercepts. But depending on where the angle is located. For example, angle ABC intercepts arc AC, but if the points are arranged such that moving from A to B to C, the arc AC could be the minor arc or major arc. But since all points are on the circle, unless specified otherwise, we usually consider the smaller arc unless stated otherwise.

But if arc AC is 130°, and arc CD is 264°, that's way too big. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. The angle at B, angle ABC, is formed by points A, B, C. Since B is on the circle, the inscribed angle ABC would intercept arc AC that doesn't contain B. Wait, but if B is on the circumference, then the intercepted arc is the one opposite to the angle. So, if points A, B, C are on the circle, then angle ABC intercepts arc AC. But depending on the position of D, maybe the arcs overlap?

Alternatively, maybe the angles are not just simple inscribed angles. Because angle CBD is another angle at B, involving point D. So, combining angles ABC and CBD, which are adjacent at point B. So, angle ABD would be the sum of angles ABC and CBD? Wait, but angle ABC is between AB and BC, and angle CBD is between CB and BD. So, if you add those two angles, you get the total angle at B between AB and BD. Therefore, angle ABD equals angle ABC + angle CBD? Wait, but that would be 65 + 132 = 197°, which isn't among the options. Hmm, but none of the answer choices are 197. So that can't be right. Therefore, my initial thought is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the angles aren't adjacent? Let me think again. Point B has two angles mentioned: angle ABC and angle CBD. So, angle ABC is between BA and BC, while angle CBD is between CB and BD. So, if you look at the full angle at point B between BA and BD, that would be angle ABD. But since angle ABC and angle CBD are adjacent, their sum should give angle ABD. But 65 + 132 = 197°, which is more than 180°, implying that the angle is reflex. But in standard geometry problems, angles are considered as the smaller ones unless specified otherwise. So, maybe I need to take the other possibility where angle ABD is the non-reflex angle. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the points are arranged such that when you go from A to B to C to D around the circle, creating overlapping arcs. Let me try to sketch mentally. Suppose the points are placed in order A, B, C, D around the circle. Then, angle ABC would be an inscribed angle intercepting arc ADC. Wait, no. Let me recall that the inscribed angle depends on the arc that is opposite the angle. So, if we have angle ABC, the vertex at B, then the intercepted arc is AC, but if the points are ordered A, B, C, D around the circle, then the arc AC would be the arc passing through D. Wait, maybe not. It depends on the direction.

Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of cyclic quadrilaterals. If four points lie on a circle, certain properties hold. But without knowing the order of the points, it's hard to tell. Wait, but the angles given involve points A, B, C, D. So, maybe the order is A, B, C, D around the circle? Not sure.

Alternatively, considering triangle ABD. The angle at B is angle ABD, which is x. But how does that relate to the other angles? Alternatively, maybe using the fact that the sum of angles around a point is 360°, but that's for angles around a single point. At point B, there are several angles. If angle ABC is 65°, angle CBD is 132°, then what's the remaining angle? If we assume that points A, C, D are arranged such that the angles at B add up to less than 360°, but again, not sure.

Wait, another idea: maybe the angles given are not inscribed angles but something else. Wait, but all points are on the circle, so any angle formed by three points on the circle with the vertex on the circle is an inscribed angle. Unless the angle is formed by two chords meeting at a point outside the circle, which would be different. But in this case, since all points are on the circle, the angles are inscribed angles.

Wait, but if angle ABC is 65°, then the arc AC is 130°, as before. Similarly, angle CBD is 132°, so arc CD would be 264°, but that's impossible because the total circumference is 360°. So, that suggests that the intercepted arc for angle CBD is actually the other arc CD, the major arc. Wait, inscribed angles can intercept either the minor arc or the major arc, depending on which side of the chord the angle is. So, if angle CBD is larger than 180°, then it would intercept the major arc CD. Wait, but the measure of an inscribed angle is always half the measure of its intercepted arc. So, even if the angle is obtuse, the intercepted arc would be greater than 180°, making the arc measure twice the angle.

But if angle CBD is 132°, then the intercepted arc CD would be 264°, which would mean that arc CD is 264°, leaving the rest of the circle as 360 - 264 = 96°. Then, arc AC was previously found to be 130°, but if arc CD is 264°, then how do these arcs fit together?

Let me try to map the arcs. Suppose the circle has arcs AC, CD, DA, etc., but I need to see how they connect. If points A, B, C, D are on the circle, then depending on their arrangement, the arcs between them vary. Let's suppose that the order around the circle is A, B, C, D. Then, arc AB, arc BC, arc CD, arc DA. But angle ABC intercepts arc AD? No, wait. Angle at B, between A and C, so the intercepted arc would be arc AC that doesn't pass through B. So, if the points are in order A, B, C, D around the circle, then arc AC would pass through D, making it the major arc AC. Wait, but angle ABC is an inscribed angle, so it should intercept the arc that's opposite to the angle. So, if the points are in order A, B, C, D, then angle ABC intercepts arc ADC. Wait, but that would be the major arc AC. So, the measure of angle ABC would be half of arc ADC. Wait, but that would make the measure of angle ABC equal to half the measure of arc ADC. Which is complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I need to use the fact that the sum of arcs around the circle is 360°. Let's denote the arcs:

Let’s define:

Arc AB = α

Arc BC = β

Arc CD = γ

Arc DA = δ

Then, α + β + γ + δ = 360°

Now, angle ABC is an inscribed angle intercepting arc ADC. Wait, but angle ABC is at point B, so the intercepted arc is the arc that's opposite to B, which would be arc ADC. Wait, but how does that work?

Alternatively, angle ABC is formed by chords BA and BC. The intercepted arc is the arc AC that does not contain B. If the points are in order A, B, C, D, then arc AC that does not contain B would be arc ADC. Therefore, the measure of angle ABC is half of arc ADC. Similarly, angle CBD is formed by chords CB and BD, so it intercepts arc CD that does not contain B. Wait, if points are A, B, C, D, then arc CD that doesn't contain B would be arc CD itself. Wait, but if the points are in order A, B, C, D, then arc CD is between C and D, which doesn't contain B. So, angle CBD intercepts arc CD. Thus, measure of angle CBD is half of arc CD. So:

Measure(angle ABC) = (arc ADC)/2 = 65° → arc ADC = 130°

Measure(angle CBD) = (arc CD)/2 = 132° → arc CD = 264°

But arc ADC is arc AD + arc DC = δ + γ = 130°, and arc CD is γ = 264°, which would imply that δ = 130° - γ = 130° - 264° = negative, which is impossible. Contradiction. So, my assumption about the intercepted arcs must be wrong.

Hmm, this suggests that my understanding of which arcs are intercepted is incorrect. Let me re-examine the intercepted arcs for inscribed angles.

For an inscribed angle formed by points X, Y, Z with vertex at Y, the intercepted arc is the arc XZ that does not contain Y. So, angle ABC intercepts arc AC that doesn't contain B. Similarly, angle CBD intercepts arc CD that doesn't contain B.

So, if points are arranged such that going around the circle from A to B to C to D, then arc AC that doesn't contain B would be the arc from A to C passing through D. So, arc ADC. And arc CD that doesn't contain B would be the arc CD directly, assuming that B is not on that arc. So, if points are in order A, B, C, D around the circle, then arc CD is between C and D, which doesn't contain B. So, measure of angle CBD is half of arc CD. But if arc CD is 264°, then arc ADC is arc AD + arc DC = arc AD + 264°, and that equals 130°, leading to arc AD being negative. Which is impossible.

Therefore, my assumption about the order of points must be wrong. Perhaps the points are not in order A, B, C, D. Maybe the order is different. Let me consider another arrangement. Suppose points are arranged as A, C, B, D around the circle. Then, angle ABC would intercept arc AC that doesn't contain B. But if B is between C and D, then arc AC that doesn't contain B would be the arc going through D. But this is getting confusing without a diagram.

Alternative approach: Let's forget about the order and focus on the angles. Given that all points are on the circle, so the circle's properties must come into play. Also, since angles at B are given, maybe we can find some relationship between the arcs.

Angle ABC = 65°, so the arc AC that it intercepts is 130°. Angle CBD = 132°, so the arc CD it intercepts is 264°. Now, if we add these two arcs, arc AC (130°) and arc CD (264°), that totals 394°, which exceeds 360°, so that can't be. Hence, there's inconsistency, suggesting that one of the arcs is actually the other arc (the major arc). Wait, but angle CBD is 132°, which is obtuse. Inscribed angles that are obtuse intercept arcs greater than 180°. So, maybe arc CD is the major arc CD, which would be 264°, and arc AC is the minor arc AC, which is 130°. Then, the total of these arcs would be 130° + 264° = 394°, but how does that fit into the circle?

Wait, maybe these arcs overlap. For instance, arc AC and arc CD may share some parts. Let me think: if arc AC is 130°, and arc CD is 264°, but they overlap, so the total unique arc length would be 130° + (264° - overlapping portion). But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's tricky.

Another idea: Let's consider the entire circle. The sum of all arcs around the circle is 360°. If arc AC is 130° (from angle ABC) and arc CD is 264° (from angle CBD), but these arcs are parts of the circle. However, arc AC and arc CD might be overlapping or adjacent.

Suppose arc AC is 130°, and arc CD is 264°, but arc AC includes part of arc CD. For example, if the points are arranged as A, C, D, B, then arc AC would be from A to C, and arc CD from C to D. But then, adding arc AC (130°) and arc CD (264°) would exceed the circle's total. This seems inconsistent.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting which arcs are intercepted. Let me recall that an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So, angle ABC intercepts arc AC, which is 130°, and angle CBD intercepts arc CD, which is 264°, but since these arcs are parts of the circle, their sum must relate to the whole circle. But 130 + 264 = 394, which is more than 360. So, this implies that one of these arcs is actually the other arc (major vs minor).

Wait, maybe angle ABC intercepts arc AC, which is the major arc AC, giving 130°, which would mean the minor arc AC is 360 - 130 = 230°, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no. An inscribed angle is always half the measure of its intercepted arc, regardless of whether it's major or minor. So, if angle ABC is 65°, then its intercepted arc is 130°, which could be either minor or major. Similarly, angle CBD is 132°, so its intercepted arc is 264°, which must be the major arc CD.

Now, if arc AC is 130°, and arc CD is 264°, but these arcs are parts of the circle. Let me imagine that the arc AC is the minor arc AC (130°), and arc CD is the major arc CD (264°). How do these arcs relate? Well, arc AC and arc CD are adjacent if points are ordered A, C, D. But then, arc AC plus arc CD would be arc AD. Wait, if arc AC is 130°, and arc CD is 264°, then arc AD would be 130 + 264 = 394°, which is impossible. Hence, contradiction again.

This suggests that there's a miscalculation or misunderstanding. Let me try another approach. Maybe using the fact that the sum of angles around point B. At point B, there are several angles. We know angle ABC is 65°, and angle CBD is 132°. Are there other angles at point B? Possibly. Since all points are on the circle, maybe there's a straight line or something.

Wait, if points A, B, C, D are on the circle, then line BD passes through B and D. So, if we consider the angles at point B, there could be angles formed by BA and BD, and others. But given the information, maybe the angles at B are supplementary or something.

Wait, if we consider the straight line through B and D, then the angle between BA and BD would be x, which is angle ABD. But angle ABC is between BA and BC, which is 65°, and angle CBD is between CB and BD, which is 132°. So, if you add those two angles, you get the total angle between BA and BD, which is x. So, x = 65 + 132 = 197°. But 197° is not among the answer choices. The options are 65, 132, 163, 180. None of these are 197. So, this suggests that my assumption is wrong.

But why? Could it be that the angle is the reflex angle, which is 197°, but the problem asks for the measure of angle ABD, which is typically taken as the smaller angle unless specified. So, 197° is reflex, and the actual angle would be 360 - 197 = 163°, which is option C. Ah! That makes sense. So, if angle ABD is reflex, but the question refers to the smaller angle, then it would be 163°. Let me verify.

If angle ABD is formed by BA and BD, and if the points are arranged such that when you go from BA to BD, you're turning through a large angle (reflex), but the smaller angle would be 360 - 197 = 163°, which is option C. So, that fits. Let me check if that's consistent with the given data.

So, angle ABC is 65°, angle CBD is 132°, so the total angle at B between BA and BD is 65 + 132 = 197°, which is reflex. But the actual angle ABD, if referring to the smaller angle, would be 360 - 197 = 163°, which is option C. That matches one of the answer choices. 

But how does this relate to the circle? Let me confirm if this approach is valid. In a circle, if two angles at a point on the circumference are given, and you add them, you get the total angle around that point. However, in reality, the angles at a point on a circle can be reflex or not, depending on the configuration. So, if the points are arranged such that extending BA and BD creates a reflex angle, then the smaller angle would be the supplement. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a property I missed here. Another way to think: since all points are on a circle, maybe there's a relation between the angles via inscribed angles. But earlier attempts led to contradictions unless considering reflex angles. 

Given that 163° is one of the choices, and the calculation leads to that, I think this is the intended solution. So, the answer would be C.
