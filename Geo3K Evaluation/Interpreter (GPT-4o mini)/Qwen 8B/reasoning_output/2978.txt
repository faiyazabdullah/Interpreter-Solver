MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a circle with center P, and several points J, K, L, M, N lying on it. There are lines connecting these points in order: JK, KL, LM, MN, NJ, forming a pentagon? Wait, but there's also some right angles mentioned. Let me parse the given info again.

First, the circle is centered at P. Points J, K, L, M, N are all on the circumference. Then there are lines: J connected to K, K to L, L to M, M to N, N back to J. That makes a five-sided figure, maybe a cyclic pentagon? But then there are two right angles: Angle at P for JPN and KPM. Also, they mention m∠MPL is 65 degrees, and NP is perpendicular to PL. We need to find the measure of arc NM.

Wait, let me visualize. Since all points are on the circle centered at P, so P is the center. So each point J, K, L, M, N lies on the circumference. Lines connecting them form a polygon. The right angles are at P? Wait, RightAngle(Angle(J, P, N)) means that angle at P between J and N is a right angle. Similarly, RightAngle(Angle(K, P, M)) is angle at P between K and M is a right angle. 

So, if I imagine point P as the center, then lines PJ, PK, PL, PM, PN are radii. The right angles at P would mean that certain radii are perpendicular. For example, angle JPN being a right angle implies that vectors PJ and PN are perpendicular. Similarly, angle KPM being right angle implies PK and PM are perpendicular. 

Also, given that m∠MPL is 65 degrees. So, angle at P between M and L is 65 degrees. Wait, angle MPL—wait, the notation might be confusing. Wait, angle MPL is at point P? No, angle MPL would be at point P if written as ∠MPL. Wait, standard notation for angle ABC is angle at point B. So ∠MPL is the angle at point P between points M and L. So yes, that's the angle at P between points M and L, so that's the central angle between arcs ML. Therefore, the measure of arc ML would be 65 degrees since central angles equal the measure of their arcs. Wait, but wait—if angle MPL is at P, then yes, it's the central angle. So arc ML measures 65 degrees. 

But also, NP is perpendicular to PL. Wait, NP is a radius, since N is on the circle. PL is another radius. So NP ⊥ PL means that the lines NP and PL are perpendicular. So the angle between NP and PL is 90 degrees. Since both are radii, that would imply that the angle between those two radii is 90 degrees. Therefore, the arc from N to L would correspond to a central angle of 90 degrees. Wait, because the angle between two radii is equal to the measure of the arc between their endpoints. So, if NP and PL are perpendicular, then arc NL is 90 degrees. 

Now, we need to find the measure of arc NM. Let me think about how to connect these pieces. 

Let me try to sketch mentally. All points are on the circle with center P. Let me note down the arcs:

We know arc ML is 65 degrees (from ∠MPL = 65°). Arc NL is 90 degrees (since NP ⊥ PL). Also, since the total around the circle is 360 degrees, perhaps we can find other arcs?

But first, let me check if there are more relations. The right angles at P: angle JPN is a right angle. So that means arc JN is 90 degrees. Because angle JPN is the central angle between J and N, so arc JN is 90 degrees. Similarly, angle KPM is a right angle, so arc KM is 90 degrees. 

Wait, so arc JN is 90°, arc KM is 90°, arc ML is 65°, arc NL is 90°. Hmm. Wait, but how do these arcs relate? Let me try to map out the arcs between the points. 

Assuming the points are arranged in order J, K, L, M, N around the circle? Or not necessarily? Wait, the lines are connected as J-K-L-M-N-J, so the order of the points is J connected to K, K to L, L to M, M to N, N to J. So the points are in order J, K, L, M, N, forming a pentagon. However, since they're all on the same circle, it's a cyclic pentagon. 

But the arcs between consecutive points may vary. However, we have some arcs determined:

Arc JN is 90°, which spans from J to N. But depending on the position of the points, this could wrap around. But maybe it's better to consider the arcs between adjacent points. 

Alternatively, maybe considering the arcs between the points in the order they appear. Let me try to see. Let me list the arcs:

From the given:

Arc JN = 90° (since angle JPN is right)

Arc KM = 90° (angle KPM is right)

Arc ML = 65° (given angle MPL is 65°)

Arc NL = 90° (since NP ⊥ PL → angle NPL is 90°, so arc NL is 90°)

But how do these arcs fit together? Let me try to arrange the points. Suppose starting from point J, moving clockwise around the circle. Let me assume the order is J, K, L, M, N, back to J.

Then, the arcs between consecutive points would be:

arc JK, arc KL, arc LM, arc MN, arc NJ.

But we know arc JN is 90°, which skips over arc JK + arc KL. Similarly, arc KM is 90°, which would be arc KL + arc LM. Arc ML is 65°, which is part of arc LM. Arc NL is 90°, which is arc MN + arc NJ? Not sure yet.

Wait, let's take arc JN: going from J to N directly. Depending on direction, but assuming the shorter arc. Since the circle is 360°, arc JN is 90°, so the rest of the circle is 270°. Similarly, arc KM is 90°, arc ML is 65°, arc NL is 90°.

Wait, maybe I need to consider overlapping arcs. Let me think:

Since arc JN is 90°, and arc KM is 90°, arc ML is 65°, arc NL is 90°, and we need to find arc NM. 

Wait, arc NL is 90°, which is from N to L. Since arc NL is 90°, then arc from N to L is 90°, which would mean that moving from N to L along the circle. Now, arc ML is 65°, so from M to L is 65°. So if we go from N to L (90°), and from M to L (65°), then the arc from N to M would be arc NL minus arc ML? Wait, not sure. Let me think.

Suppose we have points N, M, L on the circle. Arc from N to L is 90°, and arc from M to L is 65°, so the arc from N to M would be arc NL - arc ML if they are in the same direction. Wait, depends on the direction. Let me imagine the circle with points N, M, L such that arc NL is 90°, and arc ML is 65°. So if moving from N to L is 90°, then moving from M to L is 65°, so the arc from N to M would be 90° - 65° = 25°, but that's only if M is between N and L. Alternatively, if M is in the opposite direction, it could be different. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's another way.

Alternatively, since we know arc JN is 90°, and arc KM is 90°, and arc ML is 65°, and arc NL is 90°, let's try adding up the arcs.

Let me consider the entire circle is 360°. Let me try to express all arcs in terms of variables. Let me denote:

arc JK = x

arc KL = y

arc LM = z = 65° (given)

arc MN = w

arc NJ = v

We know that x + y + z + w + v = 360°

Additionally, from arc JN = 90°, which is arc JK + arc KL + arc LM + arc MN? Wait, no. Arc JN would depend on the direction. If the points are ordered J, K, L, M, N, then going from J to N clockwise would pass through K, L, M. So arc JN would be arc JK + arc KL + arc LM + arc MN? Wait, but that would be four arcs. Wait, no. If the points are in order J, K, L, M, N, then the arc from J to N passing through K, L, M is arc JN, which would be arc JK + arc KL + arc LM + arc MN. But that seems too long. Wait, but arc JN could also be the other way around, which would be arc JN through the other side. But since arc JN is given as 90°, which is probably the smaller arc. So maybe the arc JN is 90°, which would be the sum of arcs from J to N via the shorter path. 

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's challenging. However, given that arc KM is 90°, which is arc from K to M. Since the points are ordered J, K, L, M, N, then arc KM would be arc KL + arc LM. Which is y + z = y + 65° = 90°, so y = 25°. 

Similarly, arc NL is 90°, which is arc from N to L. Since the points are ordered J, K, L, M, N, then arc from N to L going the short way would be arc NM + arc ML. Wait, if moving from N to L, passing through M, then arc NL is arc NM + arc ML. So that would be w + z = w + 65° = 90°, so w = 25°. 

Therefore, arc MN is w = 25°, which is the arc from M to N. Therefore, the measure of arc MN is 25°, so the answer would be 25°, which is option A. 

Wait, but let me verify. 

Given arc KM is 90°, which is arc KL + arc LM = y + z = y + 65° = 90° ⇒ y=25°. 

Arc NL is 90°, which is arc NM + arc ML = w + z = w + 65° = 90° ⇒ w=25°. 

Thus, arc MN is w = 25°, which is the measure of arc NM, since arc MN is the same as arc NM. Therefore, the answer is 25°, which is option A. 

But let me check if there are other constraints. Also, we had arc JN is 90°, which is arc JN. Assuming the arc from J to N through the other side, which would be arc JK + arc KL + arc LM + arc MN? Wait, but that would be x + y + z + w. But we know that arc JN is 90°, so:

x + y + z + w = 90° ?

But earlier, we found y = 25°, z = 65°, w = 25°, so x + 25 + 65 + 25 = x + 115 = 90° ⇒ x = -25°, which is impossible. Therefore, my assumption about the arc JN must be wrong. 

Ah! So here's a mistake. Arc JN cannot be the sum of x+y+z+w because that would exceed 90°, leading to negative x. Therefore, my previous conclusion was incorrect. 

So, perhaps arc JN is the minor arc, which goes the other way around the circle, not passing through K, L, M. So instead of going through K, L, M, the arc JN is the shorter arc, which would be arc JN passing through N... Wait, but how? 

If points are ordered J, K, L, M, N around the circle, then the arc from J to N can be either the major arc or minor arc. Given that it's a right angle (90°), which is less than 180°, so it must be the minor arc. So, the minor arc JN is 90°, which would mean that it doesn't pass through K, L, M. Instead, it passes through the other side. 

For example, if the circle has points J, K, L, M, N placed such that moving from J to N clockwise goes through K, L, M, making a longer arc, but the minor arc JN is the other way, say going counterclockwise from J to N through the other side. 

But how does that affect our previous equations? Let me think again. 

If arc JN is 90°, then the arc length from J to N is 90°, regardless of the path. So, if we have arc JN = 90°, and we also have arc KM = 90°, arc ML = 65°, and arc NL = 90°, how do these relate?

Maybe I should consider the total circle as 360°, and add up all the arcs we know. Let me think about the arcs:

We have arc KM = 90°, which is arc KL + arc LM = y + 65° = 90° ⇒ y = 25°, as before.

Arc NL = 90°, which is arc NM + arc ML = w + 65° = 90° ⇒ w = 25°, as before.

So arc MN is w = 25°, which is the arc from M to N. 

Now, arc JN is 90°, which is the arc from J to N. How does this relate to other arcs?

Let me try to find arc JN in terms of other arcs. If we consider the arc from J to N, which is 90°, and we know that arc JN can be expressed as arc JK + arc KN. Wait, but arc KN isn't directly known. Alternatively, if we go from J to N through the other side, which would be arc JN = arc JN (the minor one) = 90°, which would not involve arcs JK, KL, LM, etc., unless those are parts of that arc. 

Alternatively, maybe arc JN is composed of arc JK + arc KL + arc LM + arc MN? Wait, no, because that would be going from J to K to L to M to N, which is the major arc. But arc JN is supposed to be 90°, so that would be the minor arc. 

This suggests that the arc JN is separate from the arc JN through the major path. So, the 90° arc JN is the minor arc, which might not pass through K, L, M. Hence, it's possible that the arc JN is made up of some combination of other arcs not involving KL or LM. 

But this complicates things. Perhaps there's another approach. Let me consider the total circle. 

We have arc KM = 90°, arc ML = 65°, arc NL = 90°, and arc JN = 90°. Let me try to find the remaining arcs. 

Let me suppose that the circle consists of arcs:

arc JK = a,

arc KL = b,

arc LM = c = 65°,

arc MN = d,

arc NJ = e.

Total: a + b + c + d + e = 360°.

We know that arc KM = arc KL + arc LM = b + c = 90° ⇒ b = 90° - c = 90° - 65° = 25°, so b = 25°.

Arc NL = arc NM + arc ML = d + c = 90° ⇒ d = 90° - c = 90° - 65° = 25°, so d = 25°.

Now, we have a + b + c + d + e = a + 25 + 65 + 25 + e = a + e + 115 = 360° ⇒ a + e = 245°.

Also, arc JN is given as 90°, which is the arc from J to N. This arc can be considered as arc JN = arc JK + arc KL + arc LM + arc MN? No, that would be a + b + c + d, which equals a + 25 + 65 + 25 = a + 115. And this is supposed to be equal to 90°, according to the given. But that would give a + 115 = 90 ⇒ a = -25°, which is impossible. Hence, contradiction. 

Therefore, my assumption about the composition of arc JN is wrong. So, arc JN must be a different combination. 

Perhaps arc JN is the arc that goes from J to N through the other side, i.e., not passing through K, L, M. In that case, arc JN would be arc JN = arc JM + arc MN? No, not sure. 

Alternatively, since arc JN is 90°, and we have arc NJ as part of the total circle. Wait, arc NJ is e, which is part of the total. From earlier, a + e = 245°, and arc JN is 90°, which could be e, since arc NJ is the same as arc JN. Wait, arc NJ is e, so if arc JN is 90°, then e = 90°, so substituting into a + e = 245° gives a = 245 - 90 = 155°. 

So, arc JK = a = 155°, arc KL = b = 25°, arc LM = 65°, arc MN = d = 25°, arc NJ = e = 90°. Total: 155 + 25 + 65 + 25 + 90 = 155 + 25 is 180, plus 65 is 245, plus 25 is 270, plus 90 is 360. Correct. 

So, in this scenario, arc MN is 25°, which is the measure of arc MN. But the question asks for the measure of arc NM. Since arc NM is the same as arc MN, just in reverse direction, its measure is the same, 25°. Hence, the answer is 25°, option A. 

But let me confirm once more. The arc NM is the same as arc MN, so yes, 25°. Therefore, the answer is A.
