MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse the given predicates and understand the setup. 

We have points A, B, and C forming a triangle. The Triangle(A,B,C) predicate tells me that these three points form a triangle. Then there's a RightAngle(Angle(B,A,C)) which means the angle at point A, between points B and C, is a right angle. So, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at A. 

Next, we're given some length equalities. The LengthOf(Line(B,C)) is 66 units, LengthOf(Line(A,B)) is 33 units, and LengthOf(Line(A,C)) is x, which we need to find. 

Since it's a right-angled triangle at A, the sides AB and AC are the legs, and BC is the hypotenuse. Wait, but wait—if the right angle is at A, then the hypotenuse should be opposite the right angle, so BC would be the hypotenuse. But let me confirm that. In a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is always the side opposite the right angle. Since the right angle is at A, the hypotenuse is BC. Therefore, AB and AC are the legs, and BC is the hypotenuse. 

Given that, we can use the Pythagorean theorem here. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So, (AB)^2 + (AC)^2 = (BC)^2. 

Plugging in the known values: AB is 33, BC is 66. Let me write that down:

AB² + AC² = BC²  
33² + x² = 66²  

Now, solving for x. Let me compute 66 squared first. 66 squared is 4356. 33 squared is 1089. So substituting:

1089 + x² = 4356  
Subtract 1089 from both sides:  
x² = 4356 - 1089  
Let me calculate that. 4356 minus 1000 is 3356, then subtract 89 more: 3356 - 89 = 3267. Wait, let me check that again. Alternatively, 4356 - 1089. Let me do it properly. 

Breaking down 4356 - 1089:  
First, subtract 1000 from 4356 to get 3356. Then subtract 89 more: 3356 - 89 = 3267. Yes, so x² = 3267. Now, take the square root of 3267 to find x. 

But maybe I made a mistake here? Let me verify the calculation again. 66 squared is indeed 4356 because 60²=3600, 6²=36, and cross terms 2*60*6=720, so total 3600+720+36=4356. Correct. 33 squared is 1089. So yes, 4356-1089=3267. 

So x² = 3267. Simplify sqrt(3267). Let me factor 3267 to see if it can be simplified. Let's divide by 3 first: 3267 ÷ 3 = 1089. Oh! Wait, 1089 is 33 squared. Because 33^2 is 1089. So 3267 = 3 * 1089 = 3 * 33². Therefore, sqrt(3267) = sqrt(3 * 33²) = 33 * sqrt(3). 

Wait, that simplifies nicely. So x = 33√3. Looking back at the answer choices, option C is 33√3. Therefore, the correct answer is C. 

Let me just double-check my steps. The right angle is at A, so BC is hypotenuse. AB is one leg (33), AC is another leg (x), BC is 66. Using Pythagoras: 33² + x² = 66². Solving gives x² = 66² - 33². Which factors as (66-33)(66+33) = 33*99. Wait, hold on! That's another way to compute 66² - 33². Let me compute that. 

Yes, difference of squares: a² - b² = (a - b)(a + b). So 66² - 33² = (66 - 33)(66 + 33) = 33 * 99. 

Calculating 33 * 99. Well, 33*(100 - 1) = 3300 - 33 = 3267. Same as before. Then sqrt(33*99). Wait, 99 is 9*11, so sqrt(33*9*11) = 3*sqrt(33*11). Wait, but earlier I had broken it down as 3*33². Wait, where did that come from?

Earlier, I said 3267 = 3*1089, and since 1089 is 33², so sqrt(3*33²) = 33*sqrt(3). But how does that relate to 33*99? Let me check:

33*99 = 33*(9*11) = 33*9*11. However, 3*1089 is 3*(33^2) because 33^2 is 1089. So 3*33² = 33² * 3. So sqrt(3*33²) = 33*sqrt(3). 

Alternatively, sqrt(33*99) can be written as sqrt(33*9*11) = sqrt(9)*sqrt(33*11) = 3*sqrt(363). Hmm, but that doesn't simplify further unless there's a common factor. Wait, but maybe I made a miscalculation here. Wait, 33*99 is 3267. And 3*33² is 3*1089=3267. So both approaches are equivalent. Thus, sqrt(3267)=sqrt(3*33²)=33√3. Therefore, x=33√3, which is option C. 

Therefore, the correct answer is C.
