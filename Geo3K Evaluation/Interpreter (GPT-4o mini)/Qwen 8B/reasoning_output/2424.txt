Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, first, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out everything given.

We have points A, B, C, D, E, and G. There's a circle defined with points C, A, B, D, E lying on it. That means these five points are all on the same circle. Then there are lines mentioned: AB, DE, CE. Also, point G lies on both lines AB and DE. Additionally, there's a right angle at angle AGD, and the measure of angle ACB is 60 degrees. The question is asking for the measure of angle BGE.

First, let me visualize this. Since points A, B, C, D, E are on a circle, maybe we can think about cyclic quadrilaterals or inscribed angles here. Also, since G is on both AB and DE, it's the intersection point of those two lines. The right angle at AGD suggests that AG is perpendicular to GD. And angle ACB is 60 degrees, which might be an inscribed angle or a central angle.

Let me note down the key elements:

1. Points A, B, C, D, E lie on a circle centered at... Wait, the circle is defined as Circle(C, A, B, D, E). Wait, does that mean the center is point C? Because sometimes in some notations, the first parameter is the center. But in standard terms, a circle is usually defined by its center and radius, but here the syntax might be different. Alternatively, perhaps the circle passes through points C, A, B, D, E. Wait, but if C is one of the points on the circle, then the center isn't necessarily C. Hmm, maybe the circle has center C? Or maybe the circle is named with parameters like center, radius, but the way it's written here is confusing. Wait, the predicate is Circle(C, A, B, D, E), so maybe the first parameter is the center. So the circle is centered at point C, passing through points A, B, D, E. Therefore, CA = CB = CD = CE, since they're radii. So points A, B, D, E are on the circumference of a circle with center C. Wait, but then point C itself would be the center, so it's inside the circle. Wait, but if C is the center, then it's not on the circle unless the radius is zero, which doesn't make sense. So maybe the circle is defined with center C, and points A, B, D, E are on the circle. Therefore, CA, CB, CD, CE are all radii. So that makes sense. Therefore, C is the center of the circle.

So, C is the center. Therefore, OA=OB=OD=OE where O is C. So, CA=CB=CD=CE. Therefore, triangles CAB, CDE, etc., are all isosceles.

Now, angle ACB is 60 degrees. Since C is the center, angle ACB is a central angle. The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its arc. So, arc AB measures 60 degrees. Therefore, the arc from A to B is 60 degrees.

Also, since points A, B, D, E are on the circle, and line AB is drawn. Then line DE is another chord. Point G is the intersection of AB and DE. Also, point G lies on both AB and DE. So G is the intersection point of lines AB and DE.

Additionally, there's a right angle at angle AGD. So angle AGD is 90 degrees. So, triangle AGD is a right triangle with right angle at G.

Our goal is to find the measure of angle BGE. So angle at G between points B, G, E.

Let me try to sketch this mentally. Points A and B are on the circle, connected by line AB. Points D and E are also on the circle, connected by line DE. Their intersection is point G. Also, since C is the center, lines CE and CD are radii. So line CE connects center C to point E, and line DE connects D to E. Also, line AB connects A to B.

Given that angle AGD is 90 degrees, and G is on AB and DE.

Since G is on AB and DE, maybe we can use some properties of intersecting chords. When two chords intersect, the measure of the angle formed is equal to half the sum or half the difference of the arcs intercepted by the angle and its vertical opposite. Wait, yes! The formula for the angle between two chords intersecting inside a circle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. However, in this case, G is not necessarily inside the circle because if lines AB and DE intersect at G, depending on where G is located. Wait, but since AB and DE are chords of the circle, their intersection point G could be inside or outside the circle. But given that there's a right angle at AGD, which implies that AG and DG are segments forming a right angle. Let me check if G is inside or outside the circle.

Wait, since lines AB and DE intersect at G, if both AB and DE are chords, then their intersection is inside the circle. Unless one of them is extended beyond the endpoints. But since the lines are defined as Line(A,B) and Line(D,E), which are infinite lines, so their intersection could be inside or outside. But given that there's a right angle at AGD, which is part of the configuration, perhaps G is inside the circle.

Alternatively, maybe G is outside. Let me think. Suppose G is inside the circle. Then angle AGD would be formed by two chords intersecting inside the circle. In that case, the measure of angle AGD would be equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs AD and BE? Wait, no. The formula says that when two chords intersect at a point inside the circle, the measure of the angle is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. For example, if two chords AB and DE intersect at G, then angle AGD intercepts arcs AD and BE. Wait, but need to confirm.

But in our case, angle AGD is formed by points A-G-D. So the intercepted arcs would be arc AD and arc BE? Not sure. Maybe I need to recall the exact theorem.

Yes, the measure of an angle formed by two chords intersecting at a point inside the circle is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. So angle AGD intercepts arcs AD and... Well, let me think. The angle at G between GA and GD. So the intercepted arcs would be the arcs that are opposite to the angle. So if you have two chords GA and GD, then the angle at G intercepts arcs that are opposite. So in this case, the intercepted arcs would be arc AD and arc... Wait, maybe the arcs that are intercepted by the pairs of vertical angles. Wait, when two chords intersect, they form vertical angles. Each pair of vertical angles intercepts arcs that add up to the total circumference. Wait, actually, the measure of the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. For instance, angle AGD intercepts arcs AD and BE? Wait, maybe not. Let me consider the exact setup.

Suppose lines AB and DE intersect at G. So, point G is inside the circle, and lines AB and DE cross at G. Then angle AGD is formed by chords GA and GD. The intercepted arcs would be arc AD and arc BE. Wait, but how do I know which arcs?

Alternatively, perhaps angle AGD intercepts arc AE and arc BD? I'm getting confused here. Let me look up the exact formula again. The measure of an angle formed by two chords intersecting inside a circle is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. So, if two chords intersect at G, then angle AGD intercepts arcs AD and BE? Wait, maybe not. Let me take a simple case. Suppose chords AB and CD intersect at G. Then angle AGC intercepts arcs AC and BD. Wait, no. Actually, angle AGC intercepts arcs AD and BC. Wait, maybe I need to draw it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think that angle AGD intercepts arcs that are opposite. So, if we have two chords intersecting at G, then the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. For angle AGD, the intercepted arcs would be arc AD and arc BE. Wait, but without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to tell. Maybe I need to find another way.

Alternatively, since angle AGD is 90 degrees, according to the theorem, that would imply that the sum of the intercepted arcs is 180 degrees. Because 90 degrees is half of 180. So, if angle AGD is formed by intersecting chords, then the sum of the intercepted arcs equals 180 degrees.

But I need to identify which arcs are intercepted. Let me assume that angle AGD intercepts arcs AD and something else. Wait, suppose lines AB and DE intersect at G. Then, angle AGD intercepts arcs AD and BE. Wait, but I need to verify. Let me think: when two chords intersect, each angle formed is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. So, for angle AGD, which is formed by chords GA and GD. The intercepted arcs would be arc from A to D and arc from... Wait, perhaps the arcs that are opposite. For example, if you have chords GA and GD, then the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are opposite the angle. So, the arcs that are not adjacent to the angle. Wait, maybe the arcs that are intercepted by the pairs of vertical angles. 

Alternatively, let's think about the entire diagram. Since points A, B, D, E are on the circle, and C is the center. Let me try to assign coordinates to make this more concrete. Maybe coordinate geometry can help here.

Assume the circle is centered at C(0,0) for simplicity. Let me assign coordinates such that:

Let’s set up a coordinate system with C at origin (0,0). Since angle ACB is 60 degrees, and CA and CB are radii. Let me place point A at (r, 0), and point B at (r*cos(60°), r*sin(60°)) which is (r*(1/2), r*(√3/2)). So angle ACB is 60 degrees.

Then, points D and E are also on the circle. Let me choose their positions. Since there's a line DE that intersects AB at G, and angle AGD is 90 degrees. Also, line CE is present. Let me see.

But maybe instead of assigning coordinates, I can use properties of circles and angles. Let me think again.

Since angle ACB is 60 degrees, which is a central angle, so arc AB measures 60 degrees. Now, since points D and E are also on the circle, let me consider the position of line DE. Since G is the intersection of AB and DE, and angle AGD is 90 degrees. Also, since C is the center, line CE is a radius. So, point E is somewhere on the circle, and line CE goes from center C to E.

Wait, perhaps there's a relationship between angles involving point G and the circle. Also, since angle AGD is 90 degrees, and G lies on AB and DE, which are chords. So applying the intersecting chords angle theorem, which states that the measure of the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs.

So, angle AGD = ½ (arc AD + arc BE) = 90 degrees. Therefore, arc AD + arc BE = 180 degrees. 

But I don't know the measures of arcs AD or BE yet. However, maybe there's a way to find these arcs using other given information.

We also know that angle ACB is 60 degrees, which corresponds to arc AB being 60 degrees. Since the entire circle is 360 degrees, the sum of all arcs should be 360. But without knowing other arcs, it's challenging. However, maybe there are symmetries or other angles we can exploit.

Another thing: line CE is mentioned. Since C is the center, and E is a point on the circle, line CE is a radius. Also, line DE connects points D and E. Since D and E are on the circle, DE is a chord. Also, line DE passes through G, which is on AB. 

Moreover, since angle AGD is 90 degrees, and G is on AB and DE. Let me consider triangle AGD. It's a right triangle with right angle at G. So, AG ⊥ GD. 

Now, considering that, maybe there are some properties of power of a point. Since G lies on AB and DE, which are secants of the circle. The power of point G with respect to the circle is GA * GB = GD * GE. Because for a point outside the circle, the product of the segments of one secant equals the product of the segments of another. But wait, G could be inside or outside. If G is inside, then the power would be negative, but the formula still holds as GA * GB = GD * GE. Wait, regardless of whether G is inside or outside, the formula is GA * GB = GD * GE. 

But since angle AGD is 90 degrees, maybe there's a relation here. Also, since we have a right triangle AGD, Pythagoras' theorem applies: AG² + GD² = AD². But not sure if that helps directly.

Alternatively, since angle AGD is 90 degrees, and G lies on AB and DE, which are chords. Maybe there's a way to connect this with the arcs. Earlier, we had that arc AD + arc BE = 180 degrees. If we can find arc BE or arc AD, we might get further.

But how?

Let me think about the rest of the circle. We know arc AB is 60 degrees. What about other arcs? For example, if we can express arc AD and arc BE in terms of other arcs.

Alternatively, since C is the center, and line CE is a radius. So, if I can find the measure of angle ACE or something related. But I don't have info about that directly.

Wait, maybe looking at triangle BGE. The question asks for angle BGE. To find angle BGE, which is at point G between points B, G, E. So, angle at G between GB and GE. 

To find this angle, maybe we can use the same intersecting chords theorem. If lines BG and EG are parts of lines that intersect at G. Wait, but BG is part of line AB, and EG is part of line DE. Wait, no. Line DE is already intersected by AB at G, so EG is just a segment from E to G. So, angle BGE is formed by lines GB and GE. So, if we can find the measure of this angle, which is formed by the intersection of AB and DE at G.

Using the intersecting chords angle theorem, the measure of angle BGE would be half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Wait, no—wait, if the angle is formed by two chords intersecting inside the circle, it's half the sum of the intercepted arcs. But if the angle is formed by two chords intersecting outside the circle, it's half the difference of the intercepted arcs. But in this case, if G is inside the circle, then angle BGE would be half the sum of the intercepted arcs. Wait, but earlier we considered angle AGD as half the sum of arcs AD and BE. Similarly, angle BGE would be half the sum of arcs... Let me think.

When two chords intersect at G inside the circle, the measure of the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. So, angle BGE is formed by chords BG and EG. These chords intercept arcs BE and... Wait, the intercepted arcs would be the arcs that are opposite to the angle. So, angle at G between BG and EG intercepts arcs BE and... Hmm. Let me think again.

For angle BGE, the vertex is at G, and the sides are GB and GE. So, the intercepted arcs would be the arcs that are opposite to the angle. So, if you imagine extending the lines, the intercepted arcs would be arc BE (between B and E) and arc... Another arc. Wait, perhaps the arcs that are intercepted by the pairs of vertical angles. 

Actually, when two chords intersect at G, they form two vertical angles. Each angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. For example, angle BGE and angle AGD are vertical angles? No, because angle AGD is between GA and GD, while angle BGE is between GB and GE. Depending on the configuration, they may not be vertical angles. 

Alternatively, maybe angle BGE is related to other arcs. Let me try to find which arcs are intercepted by angle BGE. 

The angle at G between GB and GE intercepts arcs that are opposite. So, if we follow the same logic as before, angle BGE intercepts arcs BE and... The arc that's opposite. Wait, maybe arc BA or something else. This seems complicated. Perhaps I need to find expressions for the intercepted arcs.

Earlier, we found that angle AGD is 90 degrees, which is half the sum of arcs AD and BE. So:

∠AGD = ½(arc AD + arc BE) → 90° = ½(arc AD + arc BE) ⇒ arc AD + arc BE = 180°. 

Now, if we can find another equation relating these arcs, we can solve for them. 

Also, we know arc AB is 60°, as per the central angle ∠ACB = 60°. Let me denote arc AB as 60°. 

What about arc AE or arc ED? Not sure yet. But since points A, B, D, E are on the circle, maybe there are other arcs we can relate. 

Let me consider the full circle. The total circumference is 360°, so the sum of all arcs is 360°. But we need to define variables for the arcs. Let me try to assign variables.

Let me denote:

Arc AB = 60° (given).

Let me denote arc AD as x, arc BE as y. From earlier, x + y = 180° (from angle AGD being 90°). 

Now, we need more equations. Let me think about other arcs. For example, arc AE can be expressed in terms of other arcs. 

Alternatively, since line DE is a chord connecting D and E, and line CE is a radius. Maybe there's a way to find arc DE. But I don't have direct info about that. 

Wait, but since points D and E are on the circle, and line DE passes through G. Also, line CE is a radius. Let me think about triangle CDE. Since C is the center, CD and CE are radii. So triangle CDE is isosceles with CD = CE. Therefore, ∠DCE is the central angle corresponding to arc DE. 

But I don't know the measure of arc DE. However, if I can express arc DE in terms of other arcs, maybe through the total circumference.

Alternatively, let me think about the entire circle. The arcs around the circle are AB, BC, CD, DA, etc.? Wait, no. Since the circle has points A, B, C, D, E. Wait, but C is the center, not a point on the circle. Oh wait, the circle is defined with points A, B, D, E on it, and C is the center. So, the circle has points A, B, D, E, and C is the center. So, C is not on the circle. Therefore, the circle has points A, B, D, E, and C is the center. 

Therefore, arcs between these points. For example, arc AB is 60°, as given. Arc BD, arc DE, arc EA, etc. 

But since we have points A, B, D, E on the circle, the order of these points matters. Are they arranged in order A-B-C-D-E or something else? Not sure. Without knowing the exact positions, it's tricky. But perhaps we can find relations based on the given data.

Let me assume that the points are placed in the order A, B, D, E around the circle, but I need to be careful. Alternatively, maybe points A and B are adjacent, and points D and E are somewhere else. 

But since line DE passes through G, which is on AB, maybe the arcs are arranged such that arc AD and arc BE are supplementary (summing to 180°), as found earlier. 

But how can I find other arcs? Let me think about the fact that line CE is a radius. So, if I consider point E, and line CE. Since C is the center, and E is on the circle, CE is a radius. So, if I can find the measure of angle BCE or something similar, that might help. 

But I don't have direct information about that. However, maybe there's a connection between angle BGE and other angles. 

Alternatively, let's think about triangle BGE. We need to find angle at G, which is ∠BGE. 

Since G is the intersection of AB and DE, and we have some right angles and known arcs, maybe we can use the intersecting chords theorem again. 

Let me consider angle BGE. As per the intersecting chords theorem, the measure of angle BGE is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. Which arcs? The angle at G between BG and EG intercepts arcs BE and... 

Wait, when two chords intersect at G, the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. So, for angle BGE, which is formed by chords BG and EG. The intercepted arcs would be arc BE and arc... Let me think: if you have two chords intersecting at G, say BG and EG, then the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are opposite to the angle. So, arc BE and arc... Hmm. 

Wait, suppose we have two chords intersecting at G: BG and EG. These chords intercept arcs BE and... Well, depending on where the other points are. If we consider the other arc that is not intercepted by the angle. Wait, maybe it's the arc that is opposite. For example, if you imagine the circle with points B and E, then the angle at G intercepts arc BE and the arc that is opposite across the circle. Wait, but since G is inside the circle, the intercepted arcs are the ones that are cut off by the chords BG and EG. 

Alternatively, the measure of angle BGE is half the sum of the measures of arcs BD and AE? Not sure. 

This seems too vague. Let me go back to the previous equation where arc AD + arc BE = 180°, from angle AGD being 90°. 

If I can find another equation involving arc AD or arc BE, then I can solve for them. Let me think about the total circumference. 

The total of all arcs around the circle is 360°. We know arc AB is 60°, and other arcs depend on the positions of D and E. 

But since points D and E are on the circle, and line DE passes through G. Also, line CE is a radius. Let me consider the arc from E to D. Let me call arc ED as z. Then, arc AD can be expressed in terms of other arcs. 

Wait, for example, arc AD = arc AB + arc BE + arc ED? Not sure. It depends on the arrangement of points. 

Alternatively, if I consider moving from A to D along the circle, it could pass through B or not. Without knowing the exact positions, it's challenging. 

Maybe there's a different approach. Let's consider triangle BGE. We need to find ∠BGE. Since G is the intersection of AB and DE, and we know some right angles and arcs. 

Alternatively, since angle AGD is 90°, and AG is part of AB, GD is part of DE. So, if we can find some relations between triangles or other angles. 

Let me consider triangle AGD, which is right-angled at G. So, AG² + GD² = AD². But without knowing lengths, not helpful. 

Wait, but since all points are on a circle with center C, the length of AD can be determined via the chord length formula. Chord length is 2R sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle subtended by the chord. 

So, chord AD subtends arc AD. If arc AD is x degrees, then chord AD has length 2R sin(x/2). Similarly, other chords. 

But again, without knowing R or specific lengths, this might not help. 

Wait, but maybe combining this with the intersecting chords power. The power of point G with respect to the circle is GA * GB = GD * GE. 

From this, we have GA * GB = GD * GE. 

But how can we use this? Maybe in combination with other relations. 

Alternatively, since angle AGD is 90°, and AG and GD are segments of the chords, maybe there's a relation between GA and GD. 

In triangle AGD, since it's right-angled at G, we can write GA^2 + GD^2 = AD^2. 

But AD is a chord of the circle. If we can express AD in terms of the circle's radius, but again, without knowing R, this might not be directly helpful. 

Hmm. This is proving to be quite complex. Let me try to find another approach. 

We know that angle ACB is 60°, which is a central angle. So, arc AB is 60°. Let's assume that the circle is divided into arcs AB = 60°, and other arcs. 

Let me think about the entire circle. Suppose we can find the measure of arc BE. If I can find that, then from arc AD + arc BE = 180°, I can find arc AD. Then, using that, maybe find other arcs. 

But how? Let me think. 

Consider that line DE passes through G, and point E is on the circle. Also, line CE is a radius. So, angle DCE is the central angle for arc DE. Let me call arc DE as w. Then, angle DCE = w degrees. 

But I don't know w. However, if I can relate this to other arcs. 

Wait, arc BE could be expressed as arc BC + arc CE? Wait, no. Because arc BE would depend on the position of B and E. 

Alternatively, if I can express arc BE in terms of arc BD and arc DE. 

This is getting too abstract. Let me try to assume some positions. 

Let me suppose that arc AB is 60°, and arc BE is y, arc AD is x, with x + y = 180°. 

Now, since points A, B, D, E are on the circle, and C is the center. Let me think about the positions of D and E relative to AB. 

If I can find the measure of arc AD and arc BE, then maybe I can find the measure of angle BGE. 

Let me think about the angle BGE. Using the intersecting chords theorem, the measure of angle BGE is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. 

Which arcs? If angle BGE is formed by chords BG and EG, then the intercepted arcs would be arc BE and arc AD. Wait, because those are the arcs that are intercepted by the two chords. 

Wait, if two chords intersect at G, then the measure of the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. So, if angle BGE is formed by chords BG and EG, then the intercepted arcs are arc BE and arc AD. 

Wait, why arc AD? Because when chords BG and EG intersect at G, they intercept arcs BE and AD. 

Wait, this might be the case. For example, if you have two chords intersecting at G, then each angle formed is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. So, angle BGE would intercept arc BE and arc AD. Hence, ∠BGE = ½(arc BE + arc AD). 

But earlier, we found that arc AD + arc BE = 180°, so ∠BGE = ½(180°) = 90°. But that contradicts the options given, since none of the answers is 90°. Wait, but the options are A. 60, B. 120, C. 240, D. 360. So 90° is not among the options. Therefore, my assumption must be wrong. 

Where did I go wrong? Let me re-examine. 

Earlier, I assumed that angle BGE intercepts arcs BE and AD, leading to ½(arc BE + arc AD) = 90°, but this gives angle BGE as 90°, which isn't an option. So either my assumption about the intercepted arcs is incorrect, or there's another factor. 

Wait, maybe the intercepted arcs are different. Let me reconsider. 

If angle BGE is formed by chords BG and EG, then the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are opposite to the angle. So, when two chords intersect, each angle formed is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. For example, if you have two chords intersecting at G, then the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. 

In this case, angle BGE is formed by chords BG and EG. These chords intercept arcs BE and... Let me think. The intercepted arcs are the arcs that are not overlapping. For example, if you have chords BG and EG, then the intercepted arcs would be arc BE and arc... the arc that is opposite. Wait, but since G is inside the circle, the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are cut off by the two chords. 

Wait, for angle BGE, the intercepted arcs are arc BE and arc AD. Why? Because when you have two chords intersecting at G, the angle is formed by one chord going from B to G to E, and the other chord would be... Wait, no. The angle at G is between BG and EG. So, the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are intercepted by the two chords. 

Wait, another approach: when two chords intersect at G, the measure of the angle is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. So, if we have two chords BG and EG intersecting at G, then the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are opposite to the angle. 

But since BG is part of AB, and EG is part of DE, the intercepted arcs would be arc BE (intercepted by BG and EG) and arc AD (the other arc)? 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle intercepts arc BD and arc AE? 

I think I need to refer to the exact theorem. According to the intersecting chords theorem, the measure of an angle formed by two intersecting chords is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. 

So, if two chords intersect at G, creating angle BGE, then the measure of angle BGE is equal to ½(measure of arc BE + measure of arc AD). 

Wait, why arc BE and arc AD? Because the angle at G is formed by chords BG and EG. These chords intercept arcs BE and AD. 

But why? Let me think: the angle at G is formed by BG (which goes from B to G) and EG (which goes from E to G). The intercepted arcs would be the arcs that are opposite to the angle. So, arc BE is intercepted by the angle BGE, and another arc that is opposite. Wait, but how to determine which arc?

Maybe it's the arcs that are intercepted by the two chords. For example, chord BG intercepts arc from B to G? No, G is not on the circle. 

Ah! Here's the confusion. The intercepted arcs are those that are intercepted by the two chords when extended. So, for angle BGE, formed by chords BG and EG, the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are intercepted by the extensions of these chords. 

But since BG is part of AB, and EG is part of DE, the intercepted arcs would be arc BE (between B and E) and arc AD (between A and D). 

Thus, ∠BGE = ½(arc BE + arc AD). 

But earlier, we found that arc AD + arc BE = 180°, so ∠BGE = ½(180°) = 90°. But this isn't an option. So, this suggests a contradiction, implying that my earlier assumption is wrong. 

Where is the mistake? Let me revisit the earlier calculation. 

We said that angle AGD = 90°, which is formed by chords AG and DG. Applying the intersecting chords theorem, this angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. So, angle AGD = ½(arc AD + arc BE) = 90°, hence arc AD + arc BE = 180°. 

But if angle BGE is also formed by intersecting chords, giving us angle BGE = ½(arc BE + arc AD) = 90°, which conflicts with the answer choices. 

This suggests that either the intercepted arcs are different, or there's an error in assuming that angle BGE is formed by intersecting chords. 

Wait, but G is the intersection of AB and DE, so lines AB and DE intersect at G. Thus, angle BGE is formed by the intersection of AB and DE at G. So, it is indeed formed by two chords intersecting at G. 

But then why is the measure of angle BGE not 90°? The options don't include 90°, so there must be a mistake in identifying the intercepted arcs. 

Let me re-examine the intercepted arcs for angle BGE. 

When two chords intersect at G, the measure of the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are those that are opposite the angle. For example, if two chords AB and CD intersect at G, then the angle at G between A and D intercepts arcs AC and BD. 

Applying this to our case, where the intersecting chords are AB and DE, intersecting at G. So, angle at G between B and E would intercept arcs that are opposite. 

So, angle BGE is formed by chords GB (part of AB) and GE (part of DE). The intercepted arcs would be arc BE and arc AD. 

Wait, but if that's the case, then angle BGE = ½(arc BE + arc AD) = ½(180°) = 90°, which is not among the options. 

But the answer choices are A. 60, B. 120, C. 240, D. 360. 

This suggests that my identification of the intercepted arcs is incorrect. 

Alternative idea: maybe the angle BGE is actually formed by extending some lines, making it an external angle. Wait, but G is inside the circle, so it's an internal angle. 

Wait, let me think differently. Since C is the center, and line CE is a radius. Let me consider triangle CEG. Since C is the center, CE is a radius, and G is a point on DE. Maybe there's a way to relate angles here. 

Alternatively, let me try to use coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to simplify. 

Let me place the circle at the origin C(0,0). Let me assume the circle has radius 1 for simplicity. 

Let me place point A at (1, 0). Since angle ACB is 60°, point B would be at an angle of 60° from A. So, coordinates of B would be (cos(60°), sin(60°)) = (0.5, √3/2). 

Now, points D and E are also on the circle. Let me choose their positions. Let me assume that line DE passes through G, which is the intersection of AB and DE. Also, angle AGD is 90°. 

Let me parametrize line AB. Points A(1,0) and B(0.5, √3/2). The equation of line AB can be found. 

First, compute the slope of AB: m_AB = (√3/2 - 0)/(0.5 - 1) = (√3/2)/(-0.5) = -√3. 

So, the equation of AB is y - 0 = -√3(x - 1), which simplifies to y = -√3x + √3. 

Now, line DE passes through G, which is on AB. Also, angle AGD is 90°, so line GD is perpendicular to AG. 

Point G is on AB, and GD is perpendicular to AG. Let me find coordinates of G. 

Let me denote G as a point on AB. Let me parameterize G. Let me let t be the parameter such that G divides AB in some ratio. 

But since angle AGD is 90°, and D is on the circle, I need to find D such that GD is perpendicular to AG. 

This seems complex, but let's proceed. 

Let me denote G as (x, y) on line AB: y = -√3x + √3. 

Vector AG is from A(1,0) to G(x,y): (x-1, y-0) = (x-1, y). 

Vector GD is from G(x,y) to D(d_x, d_y), where D is on the circle x² + y² = 1. 

Since GD is perpendicular to AG, their dot product is zero: 

(x - d_x)(x - 1) + (y - d_y)(y) = 0. 

But this seems too general. Maybe there's a better way. 

Alternatively, since GD is perpendicular to AG, the line GD has slope reciprocal and opposite sign to AG's slope. 

Slope of AG: (y - 0)/(x - 1) = y/(x - 1). 

So, slope of GD is -(x - 1)/y. 

But GD passes through G(x,y) and D(d_x, d_y). So, the line GD has equation: 

(y - d_y) = [-(x - 1)/y] (x - d_x). 

But D is on the circle x² + y² = 1. 

This is getting very involved. Let me try to pick specific points. 

Let me assume that D is at (-1, 0), which is diametrically opposite to A(1,0). Then, line DE would pass through G and D(-1, 0). 

But then, line DE would be from D(-1, 0) to E, which is also on the circle. Let me choose E such that line DE intersects AB at G, and angle AGD is 90°. 

But this requires finding E such that line DE passes through G and satisfies the right angle condition. 

Let me attempt to find G. 

Let me suppose that D is (-1, 0). Then line DE passes through D(-1,0) and G, which is on AB: y = -√3x + √3. Let me find the coordinates of G such that GD is perpendicular to AG. 

Let me let G be (x, -√3x + √3). Vector AG is (x - 1, -√3x + √3 - 0) = (x - 1, -√3x + √3). 

Vector GD is from G(x, y) to D(-1, 0): (-1 - x, 0 - y) = (-1 - x, -y). 

Their dot product should be zero: 

(x - 1)(-1 - x) + (-√3x + √3)(-y) = 0. 

Substitute y = -√3x + √3:

(x - 1)(-1 - x) + (-√3x + √3)(-(-√3x + √3)) = 0 

Compute each term:

First term: (x - 1)(-1 - x) = -(x - 1)(x + 1) = -(x² - 1) = -x² + 1

Second term: (-√3x + √3)(√3x - √3) = let me expand this:

Let me factor out √3 from both terms: √3(-x + 1) * √3(x - 1) = 3*(-x + 1)*(x - 1) = 3*(1 - x)(x - 1) = 3*(-(x - 1)^2) = -3(x - 1)^2

Wait, let me double-check:

(-√3x + √3) is √3(1 - x), and (√3x - √3) is √3(x - 1). Multiplying these gives √3*√3*(1 - x)(x - 1) = 3*(1 - x)(x - 1) = 3*(-(x - 1)^2) = -3(x - 1)^2. 

So the second term is -3(x - 1)^2. 

Putting together:

First term + Second term = (-x² + 1) - 3(x - 1)^2 = 0 

Expand -3(x-1)^2: -3(x² - 2x + 1) = -3x² + 6x - 3 

So overall:

-x² + 1 -3x² + 6x -3 = 0 → -4x² + 6x -2 = 0 → Multiply by -1: 4x² - 6x + 2 = 0 

Solving quadratic equation: 4x² - 6x + 2 = 0 

Discriminant: 36 - 32 = 4 

Roots: [6 ± 2]/8 → (6+2)/8 = 1, (6-2)/8 = 4/8 = 0.5 

So x = 1 or x = 0.5 

But x=1 is point A, which would make G=A, but then GD would be from A to D, which is the line from A(1,0) to D(-1,0), which is horizontal line. But AG would be zero vector, which is not valid. So discard x=1. 

So x=0.5. 

At x=0.5, y = -√3*(0.5) + √3 = (-√3/2) + √3 = √3/2. So point G is (0.5, √3/2), which is point B. But that would make G=B, but then line DE would pass through B and D(-1,0), and angle AGD would be angle at G=B between A and D. But in this case, G=B, so angle AGD is angle ABD. Let me check if this is right. 

If G=B, then angle AGD is angle ABD. But point D is (-1,0), so line BD is from B(0.5, √3/2) to D(-1,0). Let me calculate the angle at B between A and D. 

But this seems like it might not be 90 degrees. Let me calculate vectors BA and BD. 

BA is from B to A: (1 - 0.5, 0 - √3/2) = (0.5, -√3/2). 

BD is from B to D: (-1 - 0.5, 0 - √3/2) = (-1.5, -√3/2). 

Dot product of BA and BD: (0.5)*(-1.5) + (-√3/2)*(-√3/2) = -0.75 + (3/4) = -0.75 + 0.75 = 0. So the angle is 90 degrees! 

So this works. So in this case, G is at point B, which makes angle AGD = 90°, and G is at B. But this seems trivial, as G coincides with B. 

However, in this scenario, what is angle BGE? If G is at B, then angle BGE is undefined, as E is another point. But this suggests that my assumption of D being (-1,0) leads to G being at B, which might not be the intended configuration. 

Perhaps I made a wrong choice in placing D at (-1,0). Let me try a different approach. 

Let me assume that D is a different point. Let me choose D such that line DE passes through G, which is not at B. 

Let me choose D at (0,1), which is on the circle x² + y² = 1. Then, line DE passes through G and D(0,1). Let me find G such that GD is perpendicular to AG. 

Again, G is on line AB: y = -√3x + √3. Let G be (x, -√3x + √3). 

Vector AG is (x-1, -√3x + √3). 

Vector GD is from G(x, y) to D(0,1): (0 - x, 1 - y) = (-x, 1 - y). 

Their dot product must be zero: (x-1)(-x) + (-√3x + √3)(1 - y) = 0. 

Substitute y = -√3x + √3:

(x-1)(-x) + (-√3x + √3)(1 - (-√3x + √3)) = 0 

Compute each part:

First term: -x(x - 1) = -x² + x 

Second term: (-√3x + √3)[1 + √3x - √3] 

Let me expand this: 

Let me factor out √3 from the
