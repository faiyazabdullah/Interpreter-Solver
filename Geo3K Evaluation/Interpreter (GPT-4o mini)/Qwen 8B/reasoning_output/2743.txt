MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a triangle ABC. The given information includes some angles and side lengths. Let me start by writing down all the given data to make sure I don't miss anything.

First, the problem states that Triangle(A,B,C) exists. Then, there are several predicates:

1. Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)), x). So, angle at point B, between points A and C, is x degrees. Wait, no—wait, Angle(A,B,C) would be the angle at vertex B, right? Because the middle letter is the vertex. So angle at B, between AB and BC. Wait, but the notation could vary depending on how it's defined. But standardly, Angle(A,B,C) means the angle at point B formed by points A, B, C. So yes, angle ABC is x.

Then, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,C)), 60). Let me parse that. Angle(B,A,C) is the angle at point A, between BA and AC. So angle BAC is 60 degrees. 

Next, Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)), 12). So the length of BC is 12 units. And Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C)), 11), so AC is 11 units. 

So putting this together, we have triangle ABC with angle at A being 60 degrees, side BC opposite angle A is 12 units, and side AC is 11 units. We need to find the measure of angle at B, which is x.

Wait, hold on. Let me confirm the sides. In triangle ABC, each side is opposite the corresponding angle. So:

- Side opposite angle A (which is angle BAC = 60°) is BC. Since angle A is at vertex A, the opposite side is BC. Given that BC is 12 units.

- Side opposite angle B (angle ABC, which is x) is AC. Because angle B is at vertex B, so the opposite side is AC. Given that AC is 11 units.

- Side opposite angle C (angle ACB) is AB. But we aren't given the length of AB.

So we have triangle ABC with:

- angle A = 60°
- side BC (opposite angle A) = 12
- side AC (opposite angle B) = 11
- Need to find angle B (x)

Hmm. So maybe we can use the Law of Sines here. The Law of Sines relates the sides of a triangle to the sines of their opposite angles. The formula is:

a / sin A = b / sin B = c / sin C

Where a is the side opposite angle A, etc.

Let me assign variables properly. Let me denote:

In triangle ABC,

- angle A = 60°
- side a (opposite angle A) = BC = 12
- side b (opposite angle B) = AC = 11
- side c (opposite angle C) = AB (unknown)

We need to find angle B (x).

Using the Law of Sines:

a / sin A = b / sin B

Plugging in the known values:

12 / sin(60°) = 11 / sin(x)

So solving for sin(x):

sin(x) = [11 * sin(60°)] / 12

Compute sin(60°): that's √3 / 2 ≈ 0.8660

Therefore:

sin(x) ≈ (11 * 0.8660) / 12 ≈ (9.526) / 12 ≈ 0.7938...

Now, take the inverse sine (arcsin) of 0.7938 to find x.

Calculating arcsin(0.7938)... Let me think. What angle has a sine of approximately 0.7938?

I know that sin(52.5°) is roughly... Well, let's check:

sin(50°) ≈ 0.7660

sin(55°) ≈ 0.8192

So 0.7938 is between 50° and 55°, closer to 52.5°. Let me compute more accurately.

Alternatively, use calculator-like approximation.

But since I need to calculate this without actual computation tools, perhaps I can use linear approximation or recall that sin(52.5°) is about 0.7939. Wait, that's very close! Because 52.5 degrees is 52.5°, and if sin(52.5°) ≈ 0.7939, which is almost exactly our computed value of ~0.7938. So x ≈ 52.5°, which would correspond to answer choice B.

But wait, let me verify this. Because sometimes when using Law of Sines, there could be ambiguous cases, but in this case, since we're dealing with a triangle where one angle is 60°, and other sides are given, perhaps there's no ambiguity here.

Wait, another way: Let me compute 11*sin(60)/12.

sin(60) is √3/2 ≈ 0.8660254

Multiply by 11: 11*√3/2 ≈ 11*0.8660254 ≈ 9.52628

Divide by 12: 9.52628 / 12 ≈ 0.7938567

So sin(x) ≈ 0.7938567

Looking up arcsin(0.7938567). Let me think. Let me recall that sin(52.5°) is indeed approximately 0.7939. For example, 52.5 degrees is half of 105 degrees. Alternatively, using calculator input:

But since I can't actually calculate here, but knowing that 52.5° is a common angle. Let me check using radians? Not helpful here. Alternatively, think that 52.5° is 52°30', and perhaps the answer is 52.5, which is option B.

Thus, the answer should be B. 52.5 degrees. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
