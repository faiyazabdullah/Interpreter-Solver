Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have two triangles, RSV and TVS, and they're congruent. We need to find the measure of angle x, which is Angle(S,T,V). Let me start by writing down all the given information.

First, the Triangle(R,S,T) means there's a triangle with vertices R, S, T. Then, RightAngle(Angle(S,V,T)) tells me that angle at point V between points S and T is a right angle. Wait, so angle SVT is a right angle? That would make triangle SVT a right triangle. 

Next, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(R,V,S)), 78). So angle at V between R and S is 78 degrees. Wait, angle RVS? Because the angle is measured at V, between R and S. So angle RVS is 78°. 

Then, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(S,T,V)), x). That's angle at V between S and T, but wait, earlier we had that angle SVT is a right angle. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me clarify the notation. In Angle(S,T,V), the middle letter is the vertex, so it's angle at T between S and V. Wait, no—wait, Angle(S,T,V) would mean the angle at point T formed by points S, T, V. But earlier, the RightAngle(Angle(S,V,T)) says angle at V between S and T. So that's angle at V, between S and T. So that's angle SVT. Which is a right angle. Therefore, angle at V between S and T is 90 degrees. But then the next part says MeasureOf(Angle(S,T,V)) equals x. Wait, if Angle(S,T,V) is angle at T between S and V. So that's angle at T between S and V. So that's different from the right angle. So angle at T, between S and V. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should draw a rough sketch mentally. Points R, S, T, V. Given that Triangle(R,S,T) exists. Also, there's a right angle at S-V-T. Wait, the RightAngle(Angle(S,V,T)) implies that the angle at V between S and T is 90 degrees. So, points S, V, T form a right angle at V. So, SV and VT are perpendicular. So, triangle SVT is a right triangle with right angle at V. 

Also, we have measures for some angles and sides. The measure of angle RVS (angle at V between R and S) is 78 degrees. Then, the measure of angle at T between S and V (which is angle STV?) is x. Wait, Angle(S,T,V) is the angle at T between S and V. So that's angle STV. So, in triangle STV, angle at T is x, and since it's a right triangle at V, the other angles sum up accordingly. But also, the congruence of triangles RSV and TVS. Wait, the question says triangle RSV ≅ triangle TVS. So, triangle RSV is congruent to triangle TVS. Let me note that.

So, triangle RSV and triangle TVS are congruent. Let me recall that congruent triangles have corresponding parts equal. So, the order of the letters matters here. In triangle RSV, the vertices are R, S, V. In triangle TVS, the vertices are T, V, S. So, correspondence is R → T, S → V, V → S. Wait, because the second triangle is TVS. So, first letter T corresponds to R, second V corresponds to S, third S corresponds to V. Wait, maybe I need to check the congruence properly. When two triangles are congruent, the order of the vertices indicates the correspondence. So, triangle RSV ≅ triangle TVS implies that angle R corresponds to angle T, angle S corresponds to angle V, angle V corresponds to angle S. Wait, but let me think again. For example, triangle ABC ≅ triangle DEF means angle A = angle D, angle B = angle E, angle C = angle F. So, in our case, triangle RSV ≅ triangle TVS. So, R corresponds to T, S corresponds to V, V corresponds to S. So, angle at R corresponds to angle at T, angle at S corresponds to angle at V, angle at V corresponds to angle at S. 

Therefore, angle RSV corresponds to angle TVS. Wait, but angle RSV is part of triangle RSV. Let me try to map the angles. Also, sides: RS corresponds to TV, SV corresponds to VS, RV corresponds to TS. 

But let me get back. Since triangle RSV ≅ triangle TVS, then their corresponding angles are equal. So, angle at R (in RSV) equals angle at T (in TVS). Similarly, angle at S (RSV) equals angle at V (TVS), and angle at V (RSV) equals angle at S (TVS).

Now, given that, let's see. From the given, angle at V in triangle RSV (angle RVS) is 78 degrees. Wait, angle RVS is angle at V between R and S. So, in triangle RSV, angle at V is 78 degrees. Then, according to congruence, angle at S in triangle TVS corresponds to angle at V in triangle RSV. Wait, angle at V in triangle RSV is angle RVS, which is 78 degrees. So, angle at S in triangle TVS (which is angle TVS) must be equal to that. Wait, triangle TVS has angle at S, which is angle TVS. Wait, but earlier, we had that angle SVT is a right angle. So, in triangle SVT, which is a right triangle, angle at V is 90 degrees, and angle at T is x, which is angle STV. Let me try to organize this.

Let me list out the given:

1. Triangle RST exists (vertices R, S, T).
2. Right angle at V: angle SVT is 90 degrees (since Angle(S,V,T) is right angle).
3. Measure of angle RVS (angle at V between R and S) is 78 degrees.
4. Measure of angle STV (angle at T between S and V) is x.
5. Length of TV is 24 units.
6. Length of ST is 24.5 units.
7. Length of RS is 2y - 1 units.
8. Triangles RSV and TVS are congruent.

Wait, but triangle RSV and TVS. Wait, triangle RSV has vertices R, S, V. Triangle TVS has vertices T, V, S. So, these are two triangles. Let me consider their congruence. So, triangle RSV ≅ triangle TVS. So, their corresponding sides and angles are equal.

From the congruence, side RS in triangle RSV corresponds to side TV in triangle TVS. So, length RS equals length TV. Wait, RS is given as 2y - 1, and TV is 24. So, 2y - 1 = 24. Solving for y gives y = (24 + 1)/2 = 25/2 = 12.5. Wait, but do we need y? Maybe later.

Additionally, side SV in triangle RSV corresponds to side VS in triangle TVS. So, SV equals VS, which is the same segment, so that's trivially true. Then, side RV in triangle RSV corresponds to side TS in triangle TVS. Therefore, RV equals TS. Given that TS is 24.5 units, so RV is also 24.5 units. Wait, but how does that help us?

Now, considering angles. In triangle RSV, angle at V is 78 degrees. As per congruence, angle at V in triangle RSV (which is angle RVS) corresponds to angle at S in triangle TVS. Wait, triangle TVS has angles at T, V, S. So, angle at S in triangle TVS is angle TVS. Therefore, angle TVS equals angle RVS, which is 78 degrees. But angle TVS is part of triangle TVS. However, we also know that triangle SVT is a right triangle with right angle at V. So, in triangle SVT, angles at S and T add up to 90 degrees. Wait, angle at V is 90 degrees, so angles at S and T are complementary. But angle at S in triangle SVT is angle at S between V and T, which is angle VST. Wait, confusion arises. Let me re-express.

In triangle SVT (right-angled at V), the angles are:

- At V: 90 degrees.
- At S: angle VST (between V and T).
- At T: angle STV (x, given as angle STV).

So, angle VST + angle STV = 90 degrees.

Earlier, from congruence, angle TVS (which is angle at S in triangle TVS) equals angle RVS (which is 78 degrees). Wait, angle TVS is angle at S in triangle TVS. Wait, triangle TVS has vertices T, V, S. So, angle at S is between T and V. So, angle TVS is indeed angle at S between T and V. Which is the same as angle VST in triangle SVT. Wait, angle VST is part of triangle SVT. So, angle VST (at S) is equal to angle TVS (from congruence), which is 78 degrees. Therefore, angle VST is 78 degrees. Thus, in triangle SVT, angle at S is 78 degrees, angle at V is 90 degrees, so angle at T (x) is 180 - 90 - 78 = 12 degrees? Wait, but that seems too small. Wait, but that contradicts with something?

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check. If triangle SVT has angles at V=90°, at S=78°, then angle at T would be 180 - 90 - 78 = 12°, so x=12. But looking at the answer options, C is 12. However, let me confirm if this is correct.

But wait, where did I get angle VST equals 78 degrees? From the congruence. Because triangle RSV ≅ triangle TVS. So, angle at S in triangle RSV corresponds to angle at V in triangle TVS? Wait, maybe my earlier mapping was wrong. Let me re-examine the congruence.

Triangles RSV and TVS are congruent. The order of the vertices is important. So, triangle RSV ≅ triangle TVS implies:

- Vertex R corresponds to vertex T,
- Vertex S corresponds to vertex V,
- Vertex V corresponds to vertex S.

Therefore, angle at R in triangle RSV corresponds to angle at T in triangle TVS.

Angle at S in triangle RSV corresponds to angle at V in triangle TVS.

Angle at V in triangle RSV corresponds to angle at S in triangle TVS.

So, angle at V in triangle RSV (which is angle RVS) is 78 degrees. This corresponds to angle at S in triangle TVS (which is angle TVS). Therefore, angle TVS = 78 degrees. 

Now, angle TVS is the angle at S in triangle TVS. But triangle TVS includes points T, V, S. So, angle at S is between T and V, i.e., angle TVS. Which is the same as angle VST in triangle SVT. Because in triangle SVT, angle at S is between V and T, which is angle VST. Therefore, angle VST = 78 degrees. 

In triangle SVT (right-angled at V), angles at S and T sum to 90 degrees. So, angle at S (VST) is 78°, angle at T (STV) is x. Therefore, x = 90 - 78 = 12°. So, x=12. But answer choice C is 12. So that would suggest answer C. But let me check again if there are other factors.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in assuming that triangle SVT is triangle TVS. Wait, triangle SVT is the same as triangle TVS? Yes, because triangles are unordered sets of three points. So, triangle SVT and TVS are the same triangle. So, in triangle SVT, which is right-angled at V, with angles at S being 78°, leading to x=12. But answer options include 12 as option C. But let me verify with another approach.

Alternatively, maybe using side lengths. Since triangles RSV and TVS are congruent, their corresponding sides are equal. So, side RS in triangle RSV corresponds to side TV in triangle TVS. So, RS = TV. Given that TV is 24, so RS = 24. But RS is given as 2y - 1. So, 2y - 1 = 24 => y = 25/2 = 12.5. So y=12.5. Not sure if this affects the calculation for x, but perhaps there's more.

Also, in triangle RSV, we can compute its angles. We know angle at V is 78°, and from congruence, triangle RSV ≅ triangle TVS. So, triangle TVS has sides TV=24, VS=?, TS=24.5. Wait, in triangle TVS, side TV is 24, side TS is 24.5. And since triangle TVS is congruent to RSV, which has side RS=24, and side RV=TS=24.5. Wait, from earlier, RV corresponds to TS. So, RV=TS=24.5. 

But in triangle RSV, sides:

- RS = 24
- SV = ?
- RV = 24.5

And angle at V is 78°. So, perhaps using the Law of Cosines in triangle RSV. Wait, but without knowing the other angles or sides, maybe not helpful yet.

Alternatively, since triangle SVT is right-angled at V, with legs SV and VT, hypotenuse ST. Wait, but ST is given as 24.5. So, ST is the hypotenuse of triangle SVT. Therefore, ST² = SV² + VT². 

Given that VT=24, so:

(24.5)^2 = SV^2 + 24^2

Calculating 24.5 squared: 24.5*24.5. Well, 24^2 = 576, 0.5^2=0.25, and cross term 2*24*0.5=24. So total is (24+0.5)^2 = 24^2 + 2*24*0.5 + 0.5^2 = 576 + 24 + 0.25 = 600.25. So, 24.5^2 = 600.25. Then, SV^2 = 600.25 - 24^2 = 600.25 - 576 = 24.25. So SV = sqrt(24.25). Let me compute sqrt(24.25). 24.25 is 97/4, so sqrt(97)/2 ≈ 9.849/2 ≈ 4.9245. Not sure if that helps.

But in triangle RSV, which is congruent to triangle TVS. So, triangle RSV has sides RS=24, SV=sqrt(24.25), and RV=24.5. Wait, but how does that relate to angles? Alternatively, maybe using Law of Sines in triangle RSV. Let me attempt that.

In triangle RSV, angles:

- angle at V: 78°
- angle at R: ?
- angle at S: ?

We know that the sum of angles is 180°, so angle at R + angle at S + 78° = 180°. But without more info, not sure.

But since triangle RSV ≅ triangle TVS, then angles correspond. For instance, angle at R in RSV corresponds to angle at T in TVS. And angle at S in RSV corresponds to angle at V in TVS. Wait, earlier we determined that angle at V in TVS is angle TVS, which is 78°, matching angle at S in RSV. So, angle at S in triangle RSV is 78°, which would imply that angle at V in triangle TVS is 78°, which is consistent with previous conclusion.

Wait, but triangle RSV's angles: angle at V is 78°, angle at S is 78°, making angle at R = 180 - 78 -78 = 24°. But that would mean that triangle RSV has angles 78°, 78°, 24°, but then triangle TVS would have angles corresponding to those. However, triangle TVS has angles at T=x, at V=90°, and at S=78°, so x=12°, as before. So, this suggests x=12°, answer C. But why is there an option B (11.5)? Maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, let me check the triangle TVS. It's a right triangle at V, with legs SV and VT, hypotenuse ST. We found SV² = 24.25, so SV = sqrt(24.25). Then, in triangle SVT, angle at S is 78°, angle at T is x, angle at V is 90°, so x = 90 - 78 = 12°, yes. So, answer C. 

But wait, could there be an error in the congruence mapping? Let me check again. Suppose triangle RSV ≅ triangle TVS. So, the correspondence is R→T, S→V, V→S. Therefore, side RS corresponds to TV, side SV corresponds to VS, and side RV corresponds to TS. So, RV = TS. Given that TS is 24.5, so RV=24.5. So, in triangle RSV, RV is 24.5. Now, in triangle RSV, we have sides RS=24, SV= sqrt(24.25), and RV=24.5. So, checking if that holds with the angles.

Using Law of Cosines on triangle RSV: 

RV² = RS² + SV² - 2 * RS * SV * cos(angle at S)

Wait, but angle at S in triangle RSV is 78°, as per the congruence. Wait, earlier thought that angle at S in triangle RSV is 78°, but that may not be correct. Wait, earlier conclusion said that angle at S in triangle RSV corresponds to angle at V in triangle TVS, which is 78°, hence angle at S in triangle RSV is 78°, making angle at R = 180 - 78 - 78 = 24°, but that would make triangle RSV have angles 24°, 78°, 78°, and sides opposite those angles.

But then, using Law of Sines: 

sin(angle at R)/SV = sin(angle at S)/RV = sin(angle at V)/RS.

So, angle at R is 24°, angle at S is 78°, angle at V is 78°.

Thus,

sin(24°)/SV = sin(78°)/RV

We know RV = 24.5, and SV = sqrt(24.25) ≈ 4.9245.

Compute left-hand side: sin(24°)/4.9245 ≈ 0.4067 / 4.9245 ≈ 0.0826

Right-hand side: sin(78°)/24.5 ≈ 0.9781 / 24.5 ≈ 0.040. These aren't equal. So discrepancy here. Hence, contradiction. Therefore, my assumption that angle at S in triangle RSV is 78° must be wrong. So, where is the mistake?

Ah! Earlier, I assumed that angle at S in triangle RSV corresponds to angle at V in triangle TVS. But according to the congruence mapping, triangle RSV ≅ triangle TVS, which implies:

Angle R corresponds to angle T,

Angle S corresponds to angle V,

Angle V corresponds to angle S.

Therefore, angle at S in triangle RSV corresponds to angle at V in triangle TVS. So, angle at S in triangle RSV equals angle at V in triangle TVS. But angle at V in triangle TVS is angle TVS, which we previously thought was 78°, but that led to inconsistency.

Wait, but angle at V in triangle TVS is angle TVS, which is part of triangle TVS. What is angle TVS? It's the angle at S in triangle TVS. Wait, no. In triangle TVS, vertices are T, V, S. So, angle at S is between T and V, which is angle TVS. So, angle TVS is angle at S in triangle TVS. So, angle at S in triangle TVS is angle TVS, which equals angle at S in triangle RSV. Wait, no: according to the congruence, angle at S in triangle RSV (which is angle at S in triangle RSV) corresponds to angle at V in triangle TVS. So, angle at S in triangle RSV = angle at V in triangle TVS.

But angle at V in triangle TVS is angle TVS, which is part of triangle TVS. Wait, but triangle TVS is the same as triangle SVT. So, in triangle SVT (right-angled at V), angle at V is 90°, angle at S is angle VST, which corresponds to angle at V in triangle TVS? No, sorry. Let me clarify:

In triangle TVS:

- angle at T: angle TVS? No, angle at T is angle at T between V and S, which is angle VTS.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Perhaps better to use labels consistently.

Let me denote:

For triangle RSV:

Vertices: R, S, V.

Angles:

At R: ∠R

At S: ∠S

At V: ∠V = 78°

For triangle TVS:

Vertices: T, V, S.

Angles:

At T: ∠T

At V: ∠V

At S: ∠S

Since triangle RSV ≅ triangle TVS, their corresponding angles are equal. So:

∠R (in RSV) = ∠T (in TVS)

∠S (in RSV) = ∠V (in TVS)

∠V (in RSV) = ∠S (in TVS)

So, ∠V in triangle RSV is 78°, which equals ∠S in triangle TVS. So, ∠S in triangle TVS is 78°. 

What is ∠S in triangle TVS? It's the angle at S in triangle TVS, which is between T and V. So, angle TVS. So, angle TVS = 78°.

Now, in triangle TVS (which is the same as triangle SVT), which is a right triangle at V. So, the angles are:

At V: 90°

At S: 78° (as above)

At T: x = ?

Therefore, x = 180 - 90 - 78 = 12°, as before. But earlier, using Law of Sines gave inconsistency. Why?

Because the Law of Sines calculation must have been incorrect. Let me redo it. 

Assume that in triangle RSV, angle at V is 78°, angle at S is 78°, making angle at R 24°, as before. Then, sides:

- Opposite angle at R (24°): SV

- Opposite angle at S (78°): RV

- Opposite angle at V (78°): RS

So, using Law of Sines:

SV / sin(24°) = RV / sin(78°) = RS / sin(78°)

Wait, since angles at S and V are both 78°, their opposite sides are equal. So, RV = RS. Wait, but RS is given as 2y - 1, and RV is supposed to be equal to TS, which is 24.5. So, RS = RV = 24.5. But earlier, we said RS = 2y - 1, so 2y - 1 = 24.5 ⇒ y = (24.5 + 1)/2 = 25.5/2 = 12.75. Wait, but earlier I thought RS was 24 because I mistakenly equated RS to TV, but that was wrong. Let me correct that.

Wait, earlier, I thought that triangle RSV ≅ triangle TVS implies RS corresponds to TV. But according to the congruence mapping:

Triangle RSV ≅ triangle TVS:

- R → T

- S → V

- V → S

So, side RS corresponds to side TV.

Side RS in triangle RSV is between R and S.

Side TV in triangle TVS is between T and V.

Therefore, RS = TV. Given that TV is 24, so RS = 24. Hence, 2y - 1 = 24 ⇒ y = 25/2 = 12.5. 

But earlier, I incorrectly thought RV corresponds to TS, which is given as 24.5. So, RV = TS = 24.5. 

So, in triangle RSV, sides:

RS = 24 (opposite angle at V, which is 78°),

RV = 24.5 (opposite angle at S, which is 78°),

and SV is the remaining side, opposite angle at R (24°).

So, applying Law of Sines:

SV / sin(24°) = RV / sin(78°)

So, SV = [sin(24°) / sin(78°)] * RV

Calculate sin(24°) ≈ 0.4067, sin(78°) ≈ 0.9781.

So, SV ≈ (0.4067 / 0.9781) * 24.5 ≈ 0.4157 * 24.5 ≈ 10.185.

Now, in triangle SVT (right-angled at V), we have legs SV and VT, with VT = 24, and hypotenuse ST = 24.5.

Check if SV² + VT² equals ST²:

SV² + VT² = (10.185)^2 + 24^2 ≈ 103.73 + 576 = 679.73

ST² = (24.5)^2 = 600.25. Wait, this doesn't match. There's a contradiction here, implying an error in assumptions.

This suggests that the earlier assumption that angle at S in triangle RSV is 78° is wrong. Where is the mistake?

Let me go back. The congruence mapping states that angle at S in triangle RSV corresponds to angle at V in triangle TVS. So, angle at S in RSV = angle at V in TVS. But angle at V in triangle TVS is angle TVS, which is part of triangle TVS. However, triangle TVS is the same as triangle SVT, which is a right triangle at V. So, angle at V in triangle TVS is 90°, so angle at S in triangle RSV is 90°? But that conflicts with the given angle at V in triangle RSV being 78°. Wait, no. Let me rephrase:

If triangle RSV ≅ triangle TVS, then:

- angle at R (RSV) corresponds to angle at T (TVS)

- angle at S (RSV) corresponds to angle at V (TVS)

- angle at V (RSV) corresponds to angle at S (TVS)

Wait, earlier I said angle at V in RSV (which is 78°) corresponds to angle at S in TVS. So, angle at S in TVS is 78°, which is angle TVS (the angle at S in triangle TVS). But in triangle TVS (which is the same as triangle SVT), angle at V is 90°, angle at S is 78°, so angle at T is 12°, as before. But then, in triangle RSV, angle at V is 78°, angle at S is 78°, angle at R is 24°, and sides RS=24, RV=24.5, and SV≈10.185. But in triangle SVT, SV is ~10.185, VT=24, and hypotenuse ST=24.5. But SV² + VT² = (10.185)^2 + 24^2 ≈ 103.7 + 576 = 679.7, while ST² is 600.25. Clearly, this is inconsistent. So, there's a contradiction here, suggesting that my earlier conclusion about angle at S in triangle RSV being 78° is wrong.

Where is the error? Let me re-examine the congruence. 

Maybe the correspondence is different. Perhaps I got the correspondence wrong. Let me re-express the congruence statement: triangle RSV ≅ triangle TVS. 

This means that the order of the vertices defines the correspondence. So, R corresponds to T, S corresponds to V, V corresponds to S. So:

- Side RS corresponds to side TV (because R→T and S→V)

- Side SV corresponds to side VS (because S→V and V→S)

- Side RV corresponds to side TS (because R→T and V→S)

So, the correspondence is such that each side in RSV corresponds to the respective side in TVS.

Therefore, angle at R (in RSV) corresponds to angle at T (in TVS).

Angle at S (in RSV) corresponds to angle at V (in TVS).

Angle at V (in RSV) corresponds to angle at S (in TVS).

So, angle at V in RSV (which is 78°) corresponds to angle at S in TVS. So, angle at S in TVS is 78°, which is angle TVS. 

In triangle TVS (same as SVT), which is right-angled at V, so angle at V is 90°, angle at S is 78°, so angle at T is 12°, as before. But this leads to inconsistency with the side lengths. 

However, the side lengths in triangle SVT must satisfy Pythagoras: SV² + VT² = ST². Given VT=24, ST=24.5, so SV² = 24.5² - 24² = (24.5-24)(24.5+24) = 0.5*48.5 = 24.25. So SV = sqrt(24.25) ≈ 4.9245. 

But according to the Law of Sines in triangle RSV, if angle at V is 78°, angle at S is 78°, then SV should be calculated as follows:

In triangle RSV, angle at V is 78°, angle at S is 78°, so it's an isoceles triangle with RV = RS. Wait, no. Wait, in triangle RSV, if angles at V and S are both 78°, then sides opposite them are equal. The side opposite angle at V (78°) is RS. The side opposite angle at S (78°) is RV. So, RS = RV. Given that RS is 24 (from congruence with TV=24), then RV should also be 24. But earlier, we were told that RV corresponds to TS, which is 24.5. So this is conflicting. 

This suggests that the assumption that angle at S in triangle RSV is 78° is wrong. Therefore, there must be an error in the earlier mapping of the congruence. Let me re-examine.

Perhaps the correspondence is different. Let me consider alternative correspondences. Since triangles RSV and TVS are congruent, but the order of the vertices might be different. For example, maybe it's triangle RSV ≅ triangle STV instead of TVS? Or perhaps the correspondence is different. Let me think.

The congruence could be triangle RSV ≅ triangle TVS, which could mean different mappings. For example, maybe R→T, S→S, V→V? But that would require the triangles to be identical, which isn't necessarily the case. Alternatively, R→T, S→S, V→V? But then, the triangles would share points, which might not be the case.

Alternatively, maybe the correspondence is R→T, S→S, V→V? No, because that would mean triangle RSV is the same as TVS, which is not likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the correspondence is R→T, S→V, V→S, as initially thought. But this leads to contradictions in side lengths. 

Wait, perhaps the error lies in assuming that angle at V in triangle RSV is 78°, which corresponds to angle at S in triangle TVS. But if that leads to inconsistency, maybe the correspondence is different. 

Let me try another approach. Since triangles RSV and TVS are congruent, their corresponding angles are equal. Let's denote the correspondence as R→T, S→V, V→S. Then:

- angle at R (RSV) = angle at T (TVS)

- angle at S (RSV) = angle at V (TVS)

- angle at V (RSV) = angle at S (TVS)

Given that angle at V in RSV is 78°, this equals angle at S in TVS. So, angle at S in TVS is 78°. 

In triangle TVS (which is the same as SVT), this angle at S is 78°, and it's a right triangle at V. So, angles at S and T sum to 90°, giving x = 12°. But this leads to inconsistency with side lengths. 

But why is there an inconsistency with the side lengths? Let me calculate SV using Pythagoras in triangle SVT. As before, SV = sqrt(24.5² - 24²) = sqrt(24.25) ≈ 4.9245. 

Now, in triangle RSV, if angle at V is 78°, and angle at S is 78°, then it's an isoceles triangle with RV = RS. But RS is 24, so RV should be 24. But earlier, from congruence, RV corresponds to TS, which is 24.5. So, RV should be 24.5. Contradiction. Therefore, the assumption that angle at S in triangle RSV is 78° is wrong.

Hence, my earlier mapping of the congruence must be incorrect. Let me reconsider the correspondence. Perhaps the correct correspondence is different. 

Let me think: if triangles RSV and TVS are congruent, then the correspondence could be such that angle at V in RSV corresponds to angle at T in TVS. Let me try this. 

Alternative correspondence: R→T, S→S, V→V. But this would mean triangle RSV is congruent to triangle TVS via a rotation or reflection. However, this would require that angle at V in RSV corresponds to angle at V in TVS. But angle at V in RSV is 78°, and angle at V in TVS is 90° (since triangle TVS is right-angled at V). This would imply 78° = 90°, which is impossible. So, invalid.

Another possibility: correspondence R→T, S→V, V→T. Then, angle at V in RSV (78°) corresponds to angle at T in TVS. In triangle TVS, angle at T is x. So, x = 78°. But this contradicts with the right angle at V in triangle TVS, as angle at T plus angle at S would be 90°, but if x=78°, then angle at S would be 12°, and angle at V is 90°. But this would mean angle at S in triangle TVS is 12°, which would correspond to angle at V in RSV, which is 78°, but that would imply angle at V in RSV is 12°, conflicting with given 78°. So, no good.

Another possibility: correspondence R→S, S→T, V→V. Then, angle at R in RSV corresponds to angle at S in TVS. Angle at S in RSV corresponds to angle at T in TVS. Angle at V in RSV corresponds to angle at V in TVS. 

Given that, angle at V in RSV (78°) corresponds to angle at V in TVS, which is 90°. So 78° = 90°, which is impossible.

Hmm. This suggests that the initial correspondence might be incorrect, or there's an error in understanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the triangle TVS is not the same as SVT. Let me recheck the original problem. The problem mentions triangle RSV and TVS. So, triangle TVS has vertices T, V, S. This is the same as triangle SVT. So, it's a right triangle at V, with legs SV and VT, and hypotenuse ST. 

Given that, and the congruence between RSV and TVS, let's try to find the correct correspondence. 

Let me assume that the correspondence is such that angle at V in RSV (78°) corresponds to angle at T in TVS. Then, angle at T in TVS is 78°, which would make x = 78°, but then in triangle TVS, angle at T is 78°, angle at V is 90°, so angle at S would be 12°, which would correspond to angle at S in RSV. 

But in triangle RSV, angle at S would then be 12°, and angle at V is 78°, making angle at R = 180 - 78 - 12 = 90°. So, triangle RSV would have angles 90°, 78°, 12°. Then, sides would follow:

Using Law of Sines:

RS / sin(12°) = RV / sin(78°) = SV / sin(90°)

Given that RS = 24 (from congruence with TV=24), and RV = TS = 24.5.

So, 24 / sin(12°) = 24.5 / sin(78°)

Let me calculate both sides:

Left: 24 / 0.2079 ≈ 115.46

Right: 24.5 / 0.9781 ≈ 25.05

These are not equal, so contradiction again.

Alternatively, if angle at V in RSV (78°) corresponds to angle at S in TVS. Then, angle at S in TVS is 78°, leading to x = 12°, as before. But this causes issues with side lengths. 

Maybe there's a miscalculation in the side lengths? Let me recalculate SV using Pythagoras: ST² = SV² + VT².

Given ST = 24.5, VT = 24.

So, SV² = 24.5² - 24² = (24.5 - 24)(24.5 + 24) = 0.5 * 48.5 = 24.25. So SV = sqrt(24.25) = sqrt(97/4) = (√97)/2 ≈ 9.849/2 ≈ 4.9245.

Now, in triangle RSV, using Law of Cosines to find angle at V (78°):

RV² = RS² + SV² - 2 * RS * SV * cos(angle at S)

Wait, no. Let me define the triangle RSV with:

- RS = 24

- SV = 4.9245

- RV = 24.5

Wait, but RV is given as 24.5 from the congruence with TS. So, let's apply Law of Cosines to find angle at V (78°):

In triangle RSV, angle at V is between RS and SV. So, using Law of Cosines:

RS² + SV² - 2 * RS * SV * cos(angle at V) = RV²

Plugging in:

24² + (4.9245)^2 - 2 * 24 * 4.9245 * cos(78°) = 24.5²

Let me calculate each term:

24² = 576

(4.9245)^2 ≈ 24.25

2 * 24 * 4.9245 ≈ 48 * 4.9245 ≈ 236.376

cos(78°) ≈ 0.2079

So, left side: 576 + 24.25 - 236.376 * 0.2079 ≈ 600.25 - 236.376 * 0.2079

Calculate 236.376 * 0.2079 ≈ 236.376 * 0.2 = 47.2752, 236.376 * 0.0079 ≈ 1.867. Total ≈ 47.2752 + 1.867 ≈ 49.1422

So, left side ≈ 600.25 - 49.1422 ≈ 551.1078

Right side is 24.5² = 600.25

Clearly, 551.1078 ≠ 600.25, so this is not valid. Hence, there's a contradiction, indicating an error in assumptions.

This suggests that the initial assumption about the congruence correspondence is incorrect. Perhaps the correct correspondence is different. Let me try to find it.

Let me consider that triangle RSV ≅ triangle TVS, and look for possible correspondences that make the side lengths work. 

From the given, RS = 24 (since RS corresponds to TV=24), RV = 24.5 (since RV corresponds to TS=24.5), and SV is some length. 

In triangle RSV, sides are RS=24, RV=24.5, and SV. Using Law of Cosines, if angle at V is 78°, then:

RV² = RS² + SV² - 2 * RS * SV * cos(78°)

Which is:

24.5² = 24² + SV² - 2 * 24 * SV * cos(78°)

But we also know from triangle SVT that SV² = 24.25. So substituting SV² = 24.25:

24.5² = 24² + 24.25 - 2 * 24 * sqrt(24.25) * cos(78°)

Calculate left side: 600.25

Right side: 576 + 24.25 = 600.25 - 2 * 24 * sqrt(24.25) * cos(78°)

So, 600.25 = 600.25 - 48 * sqrt(24.25) * cos(78°)

Subtract 600.25 from both sides: 0 = -48 * sqrt(24.25) * cos(78°)

This implies that cos(78°) = 0, which is false. Hence, contradiction. This suggests that the given conditions are inconsistent unless the angle at V in triangle
