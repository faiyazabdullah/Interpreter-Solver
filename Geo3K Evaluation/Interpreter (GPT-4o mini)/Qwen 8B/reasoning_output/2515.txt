MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two triangles, triangle RST and triangle ABC, and they're congruent. We need to find the value of x. 

First, I remember that if two triangles are congruent, their corresponding parts are equal. That means all corresponding sides and angles are equal. So, the angles in triangle RST should match those in triangle ABC, and the same goes for the sides. 

Looking at the given predicates, there are expressions for the measures of angles and the lengths of sides. Let me list them out again:

- Measure of angle SRT (I think that's angle at point R) is 5x + 20 degrees.
- Measure of angle ABC is 3x + 40 degrees.
- Length of line TS (which would be side RT?) is 2y - 8 units.
- Length of line CB is y + 13 units.

Wait, but since the triangles are congruent, their corresponding angles and sides must be equal. But which angles correspond? Hmm. In triangle RST and triangle ABC, the order of the letters matters. So, vertex R corresponds to A, S corresponds to B, and T corresponds to C. Wait, because triangle RST is congruent to triangle ABC. So, the correspondence is R→A, S→B, T→C. Therefore, angle at R corresponds to angle at A, angle at S corresponds to angle at B, angle at T corresponds to angle at C. 

But wait, the measure of angle SRT is given. Let me clarify the notation. Angle SRT would be the angle at point R, formed by points S and T. Similarly, angle ABC is the angle at point B, formed by points A and C. Since the triangles are congruent, the corresponding angles should be equal. So angle at R (in RST) corresponds to angle at A (in ABC). Wait, maybe I need to check the order again. 

Wait, triangle RST has vertices R, S, T. Triangle ABC has vertices A, B, C. For congruence, the order of the letters tells us which parts correspond. So, angle R corresponds to angle A, angle S corresponds to angle B, angle T corresponds to angle C. Therefore, angle SRT (angle at R) corresponds to angle BAC (angle at A). Wait, but the given angle in ABC is angle ABC, which is the angle at B. So maybe I need to align the angles properly. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correspondence is different. Maybe it's R corresponds to A, S corresponds to B, T corresponds to C. So angle at R in RST corresponds to angle at A in ABC. Then angle at S in RST corresponds to angle at B in ABC, and angle at T corresponds to angle at C. 

So, the measure of angle at R (from RST) is equal to measure of angle at A (from ABC). But in the given, the measure of angle SRT (which is angle at R) is 5x + 20. And the measure of angle ABC is 3x + 40. Wait, angle ABC is at point B, so that would correspond to angle at S in triangle RST? Because if triangle RST corresponds to ABC, then angle at S (in RST) corresponds to angle at B (in ABC). So angle at S in RST is equal to angle at B in ABC. 

Therefore, the measure of angle at S in RST is equal to measure of angle at B in ABC. However, the given angle measures are: angle SRT (which is angle at R in RST) equals 5x+20, and angle ABC equals 3x+40. So if these angles correspond, then maybe they are equal? Wait, but angle ABC is at B, which corresponds to angle at S in RST. So angle at S in RST equals angle at B in ABC. Therefore, angle at S in RST = angle ABC. So that would mean angle at S in RST is 3x + 40? Wait, but how do we know which angles correspond?

Alternatively, since the triangles are congruent, all corresponding angles are equal. So angle R corresponds to angle A, angle S corresponds to angle B, angle T corresponds to angle C. Therefore, angle at R (of RST) equals angle at A (of ABC), angle at S (RST) equals angle at B (ABC), angle at T (RST) equals angle at C (ABC). 

Now, the given angle measures are angle SRT (which is angle at R in RST) equals 5x + 20. And angle ABC (at B in ABC) equals 3x + 40. Since angle at S in RST corresponds to angle at B in ABC, then angle at S in RST equals angle at B in ABC. Therefore, angle at S in RST is 3x + 40. But angle at S in RST is part of triangle RST. Also, the other angles in triangle RST are angle at R (given as 5x + 20) and angle at T. 

Wait, but if we consider triangle RST, the sum of its angles should be 180 degrees. Similarly for triangle ABC. But maybe we can set up equations here. However, the problem gives us angle measures for one angle in each triangle. Let me try to write down the equations.

In triangle RST:

Angle at R: 5x + 20

Angle at S: ?

Angle at T: ?

But since the triangles are congruent, angle at S in RST equals angle at B in ABC, which is 3x + 40. So angle at S in RST is 3x + 40. Therefore, in triangle RST, angles are:

At R: 5x + 20

At S: 3x + 40

At T: ?

Sum of angles in triangle RST is 180 degrees. So:

(5x + 20) + (3x + 40) + angle at T = 180

Combine like terms:

8x + 60 + angle at T = 180

Therefore, angle at T = 180 - 8x - 60 = 120 - 8x.

Similarly, in triangle ABC, since it's congruent to RST, the angles should be the same. So angle at A (corresponding to angle at R in RST) is 5x + 20, angle at B is 3x + 40, and angle at C is 120 - 8x. 

But also, in triangle ABC, the sum of angles must be 180. Let me verify:

Angle at A: 5x + 20

Angle at B: 3x + 40

Angle at C: 120 - 8x

Adding them up: 5x + 20 + 3x + 40 + 120 - 8x = (5x + 3x -8x) + (20 + 40 + 120) = 0x + 180. Which checks out. So that works. 

But how does this help us find x? Well, maybe we need another equation. Wait, the problem also gives us some information about the lengths of sides. 

Given:

Length of line TS (which is side RT in triangle RST?) Wait, line TS connects points T and S, so that's side RT? Or maybe I need to be careful here. 

Wait, in triangle RST, the sides are RS, ST, TR. The length of line TS is the same as side ST. So in the given, LengthOf(Line(T, S)) is 2y -8. So that's the length of side ST. Similarly, LengthOf(Line(C, B)) is y + 13, which would be side BC in triangle ABC. Since the triangles are congruent, their corresponding sides are equal. 

So, side ST in triangle RST corresponds to side BC in triangle ABC. Therefore, ST = BC. Thus:

2y - 8 = y + 13

Solving for y:

2y -8 = y +13 → subtract y from both sides:

y -8 = 13 → add 8 to both sides:

y = 21

So y is 21. Now, perhaps we can use this to find something else? Wait, but how does this relate to x? 

Wait, the problem asks for x. So far, we have found y=21, but we need to find x. How?

We need more equations involving x. Since we have angles, maybe we can use the fact that in congruent triangles, corresponding angles are equal. Wait, but earlier, we used that angle at S in RST equals angle at B in ABC, leading to the equations. But maybe we need another relationship. Wait, unless there is another pair of angles or sides that can give us another equation. 

Wait, but we only have one equation from the angles (the sum of angles in triangle RST being 180), which led us to angle at T being 120 -8x. But without more info, maybe we need to look elsewhere. 

Wait, but perhaps there's another way. Since the triangles are congruent, their corresponding sides are equal. So, for example, side RT in triangle RST corresponds to side AC in triangle ABC. But we don't have the measure of those sides. Alternatively, maybe we can use the Law of Sines or Cosines? But that seems complicated. 

Wait, but the problem only gives us one side length expression. Wait, we have ST = BC, which gave us y=21. But maybe we can find another relation between sides? For instance, if we could express another pair of sides in terms of x and y, but we don't have any other expressions. 

Alternatively, maybe there's something missing here. Let me re-examine the problem. 

Wait, the problem says that triangles RST and ABC are congruent. Therefore, all corresponding sides are equal. So, for example, side RS corresponds to AB, side ST corresponds to BC, and side RT corresponds to AC. 

But we have the length of ST (side ST) as 2y -8, and BC (side BC) as y +13. So equating them gives us y=21. But we don't have other sides given. Unless there's more information in the angle measures that can link to sides via trigonometry. 

Wait, but maybe the angles can be connected to the sides? For example, if we assume that the triangles are not just congruent but also similar, but the problem states congruence, not similarity. So maybe we need another approach. 

Wait, but maybe we can use the fact that in congruent triangles, the angles are equal. Wait, but we already used that. However, perhaps there's a unique solution for x if we consider that all angles must be positive. 

Let me check. From the angle measures, we have:

In triangle RST:

Angle at R: 5x + 20

Angle at S: 3x + 40

Angle at T: 120 -8x

All these angles must be positive. So:

For angle at R: 5x + 20 > 0 → x > -4

For angle at S: 3x + 40 > 0 → x > -40/3 ≈ -13.33

For angle at T: 120 -8x > 0 → 8x < 120 → x < 15

Additionally, the sum of angles in triangle RST is 180, which we already ensured. But without more constraints, how do we find x? 

Wait, but maybe there's another condition. Since the triangles are congruent, the sides opposite the angles must be equal. For example, the side opposite angle R in triangle RST is side ST. In triangle ABC, the side opposite angle A is side BC. Since the triangles are congruent, side ST (opposite angle R) equals side BC (opposite angle A). Wait, but we already used that to get y=21. 

But maybe we can relate the angles to the sides? Like, using the Law of Sines? For example, in triangle RST, the ratio of sides over sine of opposite angles should be equal. But since the triangles are congruent, the ratios would be the same. However, without knowing any actual side lengths except ST and BC, which we've already used, this might not help directly. 

Wait, but if we assume that the triangles are congruent, then all corresponding sides are equal. So, for example, side RT in triangle RST corresponds to side AC in triangle ABC. But we don't have expressions for those sides. Similarly, side RS corresponds to AB, and side RT corresponds to AC. 

Hmm. This seems stuck. Unless there's another relationship between the angles. Wait, but maybe the problem expects us to realize that since the triangles are congruent, the angles must be equal, so the measures of the angles in each triangle are the same. But we already have the measures of two angles in each triangle. Wait, but how?

Wait, let me think again. Since the triangles are congruent, their corresponding angles are equal. So, for example, angle at R in RST equals angle at A in ABC. So angle at R (5x +20) equals angle at A in ABC. But what is angle at A in ABC? 

In triangle ABC, angles are:

At A: ?

At B: 3x + 40

At C: 120 -8x (as per earlier calculation)

Wait, earlier I had that angle at C in ABC is 120 -8x. But how did I get that? Let me check again.

Earlier, I considered that angle at S in RST equals angle at B in ABC. So angle at S in RST was 3x +40. Then in triangle RST, angles are:

At R: 5x +20

At S: 3x +40

At T: 120 -8x

Then in triangle ABC, angles are:

At A: 5x +20 (since it corresponds to angle at R)

At B: 3x +40 (since it corresponds to angle at S)

At C: ? 

Since the sum of angles in triangle ABC must be 180:

(5x +20) + (3x +40) + angle at C = 180

Which simplifies to:

8x +60 + angle at C = 180 → angle at C = 120 -8x, same as before.

But angle at C in triangle ABC is equal to angle at T in triangle RST. So angle at T in RST is also 120 -8x. 

But how does this help us? 

Wait, unless there's another way to express angle at C. But I don't see a direct connection. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the triangles are not only congruent but also similar, but that's not stated. 

Wait, but maybe there's a misunderstanding in the correspondence of angles. Let me double-check the correspondence. 

If triangle RST ≅ triangle ABC, then the order of the letters indicates the correspondence. So vertex R corresponds to vertex A, S corresponds to B, T corresponds to C. Therefore:

Angle R corresponds to angle A

Angle S corresponds to angle B

Angle T corresponds to angle C

Thus, angle at R (in RST) = angle at A (in ABC)

Angle at S (in RST) = angle at B (in ABC)

Angle at T (in RST) = angle at C (in ABC)

So, given that, the measure of angle at R in RST is 5x +20, which equals measure of angle at A in ABC. The measure of angle at B in ABC is 3x +40, which is equal to angle at S in RST. 

But we don't have an expression for angle at A or angle at C in either triangle. So, perhaps we need to use the third angle? 

In triangle ABC, angles at A, B, and C must sum to 180. So:

Angle A (which is 5x +20) + angle B (3x +40) + angle C = 180

Which gives:

(5x +20) + (3x +40) + angle C = 180 → 8x +60 + angle C = 180 → angle C = 120 -8x

But angle C in triangle ABC is equal to angle T in triangle RST. So angle T in RST is also 120 -8x. 

But in triangle RST, angles at R, S, T are:

R: 5x +20

S: 3x +40

T: 120 -8x

Their sum is (5x +20) + (3x +40) + (120 -8x) = (5x +3x -8x) + (20 +40 +120) = 0x + 180 → 180. Correct. 

So that doesn't give us new info. 

But maybe we need to use the fact that in congruent triangles, the sides are equal. So, for example, side RT in triangle RST corresponds to side AC in triangle ABC. But we don't have expressions for those. 

However, we do have expressions for side ST and BC. Since ST corresponds to BC, and we found y=21. But how does that help us find x? 

Unless there's another side that relates to x. Wait, but the problem doesn't provide any other side lengths. So maybe there's another angle relationship. 

Wait, but maybe the problem requires that all angles are valid, i.e., positive. So for angle at T in triangle RST: 120 -8x > 0 → x < 15. Also, angle at R: 5x +20 > 0 → x > -4. Angle at S: 3x +40 > 0 → x > -13.33. So x must be between -4 and 15. But none of the answer choices are negative, so that's fine. 

But how do we find x? There must be something missing. 

Wait, perhaps the problem implies that the triangles are not only congruent but also have certain properties, like being right triangles? Or maybe there's a typo and the given angle measures should be in a specific configuration. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to realize that since the triangles are congruent, the angles must be equal, so the expressions for the angles must be equal. Wait, but we already used that. 

Wait, but angle at A in triangle ABC is equal to angle at R in RST, which is 5x +20. But in triangle ABC, angle at A is also part of the triangle. However, we don't have any other information about angle at A. 

Wait, maybe we can use the fact that the sum of angles in triangle ABC is 180. We already did that. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the triangles are right triangles? If that were the case, then one of the angles would be 90 degrees. But the problem doesn't state that. 

Wait, but let me check the answer options. The choices are A.8, B.10, C.13, D.21. We found y=21. But the question is about x. 

Is there any chance that the given side expressions could be used in another way? Let me think. 

We have side ST = 2y -8 and BC = y +13, giving us y=21. But since the triangles are congruent, other sides must also be equal. For example, side RT in triangle RST corresponds to side AC in triangle ABC. But we don't have expressions for those sides. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in assuming the correspondence of angles. What if the correspondence is different? For example, maybe the triangles are congruent in a different order? Like, maybe R corresponds to B, S to C, T to A? But that would change the correspondence. However, the standard convention is that the order of the vertices indicates the correspondence. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different correspondence. Suppose that instead of R→A, S→B, T→C, the correspondence is different. For example, R→B, S→C, T→A. But that would require checking if that fits the given angle measures. 

But without knowing the correspondence, this is risky. However, the original problem says that triangle RST ≅ triangle ABC. The standard notation for congruence is that the order of the vertices corresponds. So, R corresponds to A, S to B, T to C. 

Assuming that, we have angle at R (in RST) corresponds to angle at A (in ABC). Given that, the measure of angle at R in RST is 5x +20, which equals measure of angle at A in ABC. But we don't have any other info about angle at A. 

Wait, unless there's another angle that can be expressed. For instance, in triangle ABC, angle at A is 5x +20, angle at B is 3x +40, angle at C is 120 -8x. So, if we can find another relationship between these angles. 

Wait, but all three angles must be positive, as discussed. But without more info, how to proceed? 

Wait, maybe the problem expects us to recognize that the angles in the triangles are supplementary or complementary? Or that some angles are equal? 

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves the exterior angles or something else. 

Wait, but I'm stuck. Let me think differently. Since we have y=21, and the answer choices include D.21, which is the value of y. But the question asks for x. 

Maybe I missed something. Let me go back to the beginning. 

Given that triangles are congruent, their corresponding sides are equal. So, side RS corresponds to AB, side ST corresponds to BC, and side RT corresponds to AC. 

We have the length of ST as 2y-8, and BC as y+13. Setting them equal gives y=21. 

But what about other sides? For example, suppose we can express other sides in terms of y. But we don't have any other expressions. 

Wait, unless the problem assumes that the triangles are not only congruent but also have specific side lengths. But without more info, this isn't possible. 

Wait, but maybe the problem assumes that the triangles are not only congruent but also have specific types, like isoceles or something. For example, if two sides are equal. 

But we don't have enough info. 

Wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption in the correspondence of angles. Let me re-express the angles. 

Suppose that triangle RST ≅ triangle ABC. So, angle R corresponds to angle A, angle S to B, angle T to C. 

Given that, angle at R (in RST) = 5x +20 = angle at A (in ABC). 

Angle at B (in ABC) = 3x +40, which corresponds to angle at S (in RST). 

So angle at S in RST = 3x +40. 

In triangle RST, the angles are:

At R: 5x +20

At S: 3x +40

At T: ?

Sum is 180, so angle at T = 180 - (5x +20) - (3x +40) = 180 - 8x -60 = 120 -8x. 

In triangle ABC, angles are:

At A: 5x +20

At B: 3x +40

At C: 120 -8x

Sum is 180, as checked. 

But how does this help? 

Wait, unless there's a relationship between the sides and angles. For example, using the Law of Sines. 

In triangle RST, the Law of Sines says:

RS / sin(angle T) = ST / sin(angle R) = RT / sin(angle S)

Similarly for triangle ABC. Since the triangles are congruent, all ratios are the same. 

But without knowing any side lengths, this might not help. 

Wait, but we have ST = 2y -8 and BC = y +13. Since ST corresponds to BC, we already solved for y=21. 

But if we could relate other sides to other angles... For example, if we assume that another pair of sides is equal. For example, side RT in RST corresponds to side AC in ABC. But we don't have their lengths. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the triangles are not only congruent but also have specific angle measures that allow solving for x. 

Wait, let me think: if we assume that the angles must satisfy certain conditions. For example, if one of the angles is a right angle. Let's say angle at T in RST is 90 degrees. Then 120 -8x = 90 → 8x = 30 → x=3.75, which is not among the answer choices. 

Or, if angle at R is 90 degrees: 5x +20 = 90 → 5x =70 → x=14. Not in options. 

Or angle at S: 3x +40 =90 → 3x=50 → x≈16.67. Not in options. 

None of these seem to fit. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation earlier. Let me check again. 

From the congruence, we have y=21. Is there a way to connect x to this? 

Wait, maybe the problem assumes that the triangles are not only congruent but also have certain properties. For example, maybe the triangles are isosceles. Let's explore that. 

If triangle RST is isosceles, then two sides are equal. For example, if RS = RT, then angles at T and S would be equal. But we don't know. 

Alternatively, if angle at R equals angle at S, then 5x +20 = 3x +40 → 2x = 20 → x=10. Which is option B. 

Wait, this is a possibility! Let me check. 

If angle at R equals angle at S, then 5x +20 = 3x +40 → 2x=20 → x=10. 

But why would angle at R equal angle at S? Because if the triangles are isosceles? Or because of some other reason? 

Wait, but we don't know that the triangles are isosceles. However, the problem doesn't specify anything about the triangles being isosceles. So this might be an incorrect assumption. 

But maybe there's another way. If the triangles are congruent, and if there's a specific property that forces x to satisfy a certain condition. 

Wait, but if we assume that the triangles are not only congruent but also that angle at R equals angle at S, then x=10. Which is option B. 

But why would angle at R equal angle at S? Unless there's a reason. 

Wait, unless the problem has a typo and meant to say that the triangles are similar instead of congruent. In that case, the angle measures would be equal, but the sides would be proportional. But even then, we'd need more info. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the triangles are such that the given angles are the only ones, and thus the equations must hold. 

Wait, but we only have two angles in each triangle, and the third angle is determined. But without more information, how can we find x? 

This suggests that there's a missing piece of information, but since the problem gives answer choices, perhaps there's an implied assumption. 

Wait, going back to the initial thought: if angle at R equals angle at S, then x=10. Which is option B. 

But why would angle at R equal angle at S? Because if the triangles are isosceles? Or maybe because of the way the congruence is defined? 

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in the earlier steps. Let me check again. 

Wait, the problem says that triangles RST and ABC are congruent. So, all corresponding angles are equal. But we have two angles given: one in each triangle. But we don't know which angles they are. 

Wait, perhaps the given angle measures are for corresponding angles. For example, angle at R in RST is equal to angle at A in ABC, and angle at B in ABC is equal to angle at S in RST. But we don't have info about angle at A or angle at C. 

But if we consider that the sum of angles in triangle ABC is 180, and we have two angles in terms of x, maybe we can set up an equation. 

Let me try that. 

In triangle ABC, angles at A, B, C are:

At A: 5x +20 (since it corresponds to angle at R in RST)

At B: 3x +40 (given)

At C: ?

Sum of angles: (5x +20) + (3x +40) + angle C = 180 → 8x +60 + angle C = 180 → angle C = 120 -8x. 

But angle C in triangle ABC corresponds to angle T in triangle RST. So angle T in RST is also 120 -8x. 

But in triangle RST, angle at T is 120 -8x, as previously calculated. 

So, unless there's a relationship between angle C and something else, this doesn't help. 

But wait, if we assume that angle C is equal to angle at T in RST, which is 120 -8x. But that's already accounted for. 

Hmm. 

Wait, but if we consider that in triangle RST, the angles are 5x +20, 3x +40, and 120 -8x. These must all be positive. 

So:

5x +20 > 0 → x > -4

3x +40 > 0 → x > -13.33

120 -8x > 0 → x < 15

So x is between -4 and 15. 

But the answer choices are 8,10,13,21. All within this range except 21. But 21 is y's value. 

But how to find x? 

Wait, maybe there's a miscalculation in the correspondence of the angles. 

Wait, if angle at B in ABC is 3x +40, and since triangles are congruent, this angle corresponds to angle at S in RST. So, in triangle RST, angle at S is 3x +40. 

Also, in triangle RST, angle at R is 5x +20. 

So, if we assume that the sum of angles at R and S in triangle RST is less than 180, which it is, but that doesn't help. 

Wait, unless there's a specific type of triangle. For example, if the triangles are right triangles. Let's assume that one of the angles is 90 degrees. 

Let's test each possibility:

Case 1: Angle at R is 90 degrees: 5x +20 =90 → x=14. Not in choices.

Case 2: Angle at S is 90 degrees: 3x +40 =90 → x=50/3 ≈16.67. Not in choices.

Case 3: Angle at T is 90 degrees: 120 -8x =90 → 8x=30 → x=3.75. Not in choices.

No luck. 

Another idea: Maybe the triangles are such that the given sides are corresponding, and the angles are related to the sides via the Law of Cosines. But without knowing the sides, this seems difficult. 

Wait, but we know y=21. Perhaps there's a way to relate x and y through the sides? For example, if we could find another pair of corresponding sides. 

For example, side RT in triangle RST corresponds to side AC in triangle ABC. Let's denote their lengths. 

But we don't have expressions for these sides. However, if we could express them in terms of y or x, but we don't have enough info. 

Wait, but maybe we can use the Law of Cosines on one of the triangles. Let's try. 

Take triangle RST. We know two angles and the included side? No, we only know two angles and the third angle. 

Wait, but if we assume that the triangles are not only congruent but also have sides related to x and y. 

Wait, but this seems too vague. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the triangles are not only congruent but also have specific side lengths, and the given expressions for the sides must satisfy certain conditions. 

But without more info, this is impossible. 

Wait, but maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup. Or perhaps I missed a key insight. 

Wait, let me revisit the problem statement. It says that triangle RST is congruent to triangle ABC. The given predicates are about the measures of angles and lengths of sides. 

Wait, the angle measures are for angle SRT (which is angle at R) and angle ABC (at B). The side lengths are for ST and BC. 

Since the triangles are congruent, the corresponding sides and angles are equal. So, angle at R in RST equals angle at A in ABC. Angle at B in ABC equals angle at S in RST. 

But we don't have any other angle measures. However, the measure of angle at R in RST is 5x +20, and angle at B in ABC is 3x +40. Since these are corresponding angles, they should be equal? Wait, no. Wait, angle at R in RST corresponds to angle at A in ABC, while angle at B in ABC corresponds to angle at S in RST. So, angle at R in RST (5x +20) equals angle at A in ABC, and angle at B in ABC (3x +40) equals angle at S in RST. 

But angle at S in RST is part of triangle RST. So, angle at S in RST is 3x +40, and angle at R is 5x +20. 

Now, if we consider triangle RST, the sum of its angles is 180. So:

(5x +20) + (3x +40) + angle at T = 180 → 8x +60 + angle at T = 180 → angle at T = 120 -8x. 

But angle at T in RST corresponds to angle at C in ABC. So, angle at C in ABC is 120 -8x. 

Now, in triangle ABC, the angles are:

At A: 5x +20

At B: 3x +40

At C: 120 -8x

Sum is 180, as checked. 

But how does this help us find x? 

Unless there's a relationship between the sides and angles. For example, if we assume that the triangles are right triangles, but we don't have that info. 

Wait, but if we assume that the triangles are such that angle at C is equal to angle at T, which we already have. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects that the triangles are such that the given angles are the only ones, and hence, there's no other constraint. But this seems impossible. 

Wait, but maybe there's an error in the problem, and the given angle measures are supposed to be for corresponding angles. For example, if angle at R in RST is equal to angle at B in ABC, which would mean 5x +20 = 3x +40 → 2x = 20 → x=10. This is option B. 

But why would angle at R in RST be equal to angle at B in ABC? Because if the triangles are congruent, but the correspondence is different? 

Wait, if the correspondence is different. Suppose that the congruence is such that angle R corresponds to angle B, angle S to angle C, angle T to angle A. Then, angle at R would correspond to angle at B. In that case, 5x +20 = 3x +40 → x=10. 

But this assumes a different correspondence. But the standard convention is that the order of the vertices indicates the correspondence. So, if the congruence is written as ΔRST ≅ ΔABC, then the correspondence is R→A, S→B, T→C. 

But if the problem implicitly assumes a different correspondence, then this would make sense. 

However, this would be a misinterpretation of the standard convention. But since this leads to an answer in the choices, maybe this is the intended approach. 

Given that, the answer would be x=10, which is option B. 

But this relies on an incorrect correspondence of angles, which is a stretch. However, given that this is the only way to arrive at an answer among the choices, this might be the intended solution. 

Therefore, the correct answer is B. 10.
