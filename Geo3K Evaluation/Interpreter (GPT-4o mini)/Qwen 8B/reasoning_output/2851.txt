====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the measure of angle A in a triangle where angles B and C are given as 35 degrees and 52 degrees respectively. The options are A, B, C, D with corresponding values. 

First, I need to recall the fundamental property of triangles regarding their angles. From what I remember, the sum of the interior angles in any triangle is always 180 degrees. That seems crucial here. Let me check if the given predicates support this. The first predicate says Triangle(A, B, C), so we're dealing with a triangle with vertices A, B, and C. Then there's an equality stating that the sum of the measures of angles A, B, and C equals 180 degrees. That confirms the triangle angle sum theorem. 

Next, the problem gives specific measures for angles B and C. It states MeasureOf(Angle(B)) is 35 degrees and MeasureOf(Angle(C)) is 52 degrees. The question asks for MeasureOf(Angle(A)), which is denoted as x. 

So, applying the triangle angle sum theorem, the sum of angles A + B + C = 180. We know B and C, so substituting those values should allow us to solve for A. Let me write that out:

MeasureOf(A) + 35 + 52 = 180.

Adding 35 and 52 gives 87. Therefore, MeasureOf(A) would be 180 minus 87, which is 93. Wait, but looking at the answer choices, D is 93. But let me double-check my math. 35 plus 52 is indeed 87. Subtracting that from 180 gives 93. Hmm, but wait, the options include 93 as D. However, sometimes there might be a trick, like maybe the angles aren't in a triangle? But the first predicate says it's a triangle, so that's covered. 

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't misread anything. The problem mentions Equals(SumOf(...), 180), so that's explicitly stating the sum is 180. So no issues there. So, 180 - 35 -52 = 93. That seems straightforward. But why is there an option C as 77? Maybe if someone subtracted incorrectly? For example, 35+52=87, so 180-87=93. So unless there's some other factor, like maybe the triangle isn't Euclidean? But the problem doesn't mention anything like that. 

Alternatively, could there be a miscalculation here? Let me recompute. 35 + 52 is 87. 180 - 87 is 93. Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be D. But wait, the options are A.35, B.52, C.77, D.93. So D is 93. Therefore, the correct answer is D. 

But wait, another thoughtâ€”could there be a misunderstanding of the predicates? Like, maybe the SumOf function includes something else? But according to the given predicates, the sum of the measures of angles A, B, and C equals 180. So that's directly giving the total. So yes, subtracting the two known angles from 180 gives the third. 

Therefore, the answer should be D. 93. Let me confirm once more. 35 + 52 = 87. 180 - 87 = 93. Yep. So Final Answer: D.
