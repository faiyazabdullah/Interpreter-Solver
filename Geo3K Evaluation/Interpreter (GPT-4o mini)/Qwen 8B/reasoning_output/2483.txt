<think>
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out everything provided.

We have two triangles: Triangle(M,P,O) and Triangle(Q,N,O). Points M, Q, N, P, O are all defined as points. There are several lines mentioned: Line(M,P), Line(M,O), Line(P,O) for the first triangle, and Line(Q,N) for the second. Also, there's a relationship that Line(Q,N) is parallel to Line(P,O). 

The lengths given are: LengthOf(Line(M,P)) = 5, LengthOf(Line(M,O)) = 6, LengthOf(Line(N,O)) = 3.6. The question asks for Q P, which I assume refers to the length of Line(Q,P), denoted as x in the predicates. So we need to find x, which is the length of QP.

Since Line(Q,N) is parallel to Line(P,O), maybe there's some similarity or proportionality here. Let me think about the triangles involved. Both triangles share point O. Wait, Triangle(Q,N,O) has sides QN, NO, and OQ? Or maybe it's QN, QO, and NO? Wait, the sides of Triangle(Q,N,O) would be QN, QO, and NO. But the given line is Line(Q,N), so that's one side. Then Line(Q,N) is parallel to Line(P,O). 

Let me visualize this. Suppose we have two triangles sharing a common vertex at O. The first triangle is MPO, with MP=5, MO=6, PO is another side. The second triangle is QNO, with QN being one side, and NO=3.6. Since QN is parallel to PO, perhaps these triangles are similar?

Wait, if two lines are parallel, maybe corresponding angles are equal, leading to similar triangles. Let me check if there are any similar triangles here. For example, if Line(Q,N) || Line(P,O), then maybe triangle QNO is similar to triangle PMO? Wait, but triangle PMO has vertices M, P, O. The other triangle is Q, N, O. Hmm, maybe not directly. Alternatively, since QN || PO, could there be a transversal creating similar triangles?

Alternatively, considering coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to points to calculate distances. Let me try that approach.

Let me assign coordinates to make this easier. Let's place point O at the origin (0,0). Then, since Line(P,O) is part of Triangle(M,P,O), and we know MO=6, OP is a side. Wait, but without knowing angles, it's hard. Alternatively, maybe use vectors or coordinate geometry.

But maybe using ratios because of the parallel lines. If QN is parallel to PO, then the ratio of QN to PO should be the same as the ratio of corresponding segments. Wait, but what's the relation between the triangles? Let me see.

In triangle MPO, we have sides MP=5, MO=6, and PO. Wait, but we don't know PO. However, in triangle QNO, we have NO=3.6. If QN || PO, then maybe triangle QNO is similar to triangle MPO? Because if two sides are proportional and included angles are equal due to parallel lines. Wait, but how?

Wait, if QN || PO, then the angle between QN and QO would be equal to the angle between PO and PO... No, maybe considering alternate interior angles. Let me think again.

Suppose Line(Q,N) is parallel to Line(P,O). So, imagine two lines intersected by a transversal. Let me consider the transversal connecting points Q and P. Wait, but we don't know where P is relative to Q. Alternatively, maybe looking at triangles involving these lines.

Alternatively, since QN || PO, then the slope of QN equals the slope of PO. If we can express coordinates such that PO has a certain slope, and QN has the same. But without coordinates, maybe using vectors.

Alternatively, think of vectors. Vector PO is from P to O. Vector QN is from Q to N. Since they're parallel, vector QN is scalar multiple of vector PO. But how does that help us find QP?

Alternatively, using the concept of similar triangles. If two lines are parallel, then the triangles formed by those lines and a third line may be similar. For instance, if we have two triangles where one pair of sides is parallel, maybe they are similar.

Wait, suppose we look at triangles QNO and MPO. Are they similar? Let me check the angles. Since QN || PO, the angle at O for triangle QNO would correspond to the angle at O for triangle MPO? Not sure. Wait, maybe triangle QNO and triangle MPO are similar if the sides around the angle at O are proportional. But we need more info.

Wait, given that QN || PO, then the angle between QN and QO is equal to the angle between PO and PO? Wait, maybe not. Let me try to think of it differently. 

Let me consider the triangles formed by the parallel lines. Since QN || PO, then if there's a transversal cutting them, like the line connecting Q to P, maybe creating similar triangles. 

Wait, if QN is parallel to PO, then the distance between these lines might relate to the lengths. But without knowing heights or other lengths, it's tricky. 

Wait, but we have specific lengths given. In triangle MPO, we know MP=5, MO=6, and we need to find PO. Wait, but triangle MPO: points M, P, O. We know MP=5, MO=6, and PO is a side. But unless we have more info about the triangle, like angles or other sides, we can't compute PO directly. However, maybe using the Law of Cosines if we had an angle, but we don't. 

Wait, but maybe triangle MPO isn't necessarily a right triangle. Unless there's something else. Alternatively, since QN || PO, perhaps triangle QNO is similar to triangle MPO?

Wait, let me think again. If QN is parallel to PO, then the corresponding angles formed by the transversal QO would be equal. So, angle at O for triangle QNO and angle at O for triangle MPO? Wait, but O is a common point. Wait, maybe not. Let me draw a rough sketch mentally. 

Imagine two triangles sharing point O. One triangle is M-P-O, and the other is Q-N-O. The lines QN and PO are parallel. So, if I connect Q to P, maybe forming a trapezoid? Or some quadrilateral. 

Alternatively, since QN || PO, then the ratio of QN to PO would be equal to the ratio of QO to MO if there's some proportionality. Wait, but how?

Wait, maybe using the intercept theorem (Thales' theorem). If two lines are cut by parallel lines, then the segments are proportional. For example, if we have two lines intersected by parallel lines, then the segments are proportional. 

Assuming that line QN is parallel to line PO, and they are cut by transversals QO and MO. Wait, not sure. Let me try to define the situation better.

Suppose line QN is parallel to line PO. Let's say these two lines are cut by two other lines: QO and MO. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if there's a transversal that crosses both QN and PO, creating similar triangles. 

Alternatively, think of triangles QNO and MPO. If QN || PO, then angle QNO is equal to angle MPO (corresponding angles), and angle NOQ is equal to angle MOP. Therefore, triangles QNO and MPO would be similar by AA similarity. 

If that's true, then the ratio of sides would be consistent. Let's check:

In triangle QNO and triangle MPO:

- Angle at O is common? Wait, no. Wait, if QN || PO, then angle between QN and QO equals angle between PO and PO? Not sure. Wait, maybe angle QON equals angle POM? Not sure. Let me clarify.

Actually, since QN || PO, then the angle between QN and QO is equal to the angle between PO and QO? Wait, maybe not. Let me think of the transversal QO crossing the parallel lines QN and PO. So, the angle between QN and QO would be equal to the angle between PO and QO. Wait, that seems possible. So, angle OQN equals angle OPO? Not sure. This is getting confusing. Let me try to write down the proportions.

If triangles QNO and MPO are similar, then the ratio of QN / PO = QO / MO = NO / PO. Wait, but I need to confirm the correspondence of the sides. 

Alternatively, since QN || PO, then the ratio of QN to PO would be equal to the ratio of QO to MO if they are corresponding sides. Wait, but I need to establish the similarity properly. 

Alternatively, let's denote the ratio of similarity between triangles QNO and MPO. If they are similar, then:

QN / PO = QO / MO = NO / PO ?

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. If the triangles are similar, then corresponding sides must be proportional. Let's say triangle QNO ~ triangle MPO. Then:

QN corresponds to MP,

NO corresponds to PO,

and QO corresponds to MO.

So, QN / MP = NO / PO = QO / MO.

But we know MP = 5, NO = 3.6, MO = 6. Let me plug in the known values.

From QN / MP = NO / PO => QN / 5 = 3.6 / PO.

Also, QO / MO = NO / PO => QO / 6 = 3.6 / PO.

But we also know that QN is parallel to PO, so maybe there's another relation. Wait, but we don't know QO or QN yet. However, the question is asking for QP, which is the length of the segment connecting Q to P. How does that fit into this?

Alternatively, maybe triangle QNP is related somehow. Wait, not sure. 

Alternatively, since QN || PO, then the distance between these lines could be related via the height of the triangles. But without knowing heights, it's still unclear. 

Wait, but maybe using vectors. Let me assign coordinates. Let me set O at (0,0). Let me assume that line PO is along the x-axis for simplicity. So, point O is (0,0), and point P is somewhere along the x-axis. Let's say P is at (a, 0). Then, since MO = 6, and M is another point connected to O. Also, MP = 5. 

But without knowing the position of M, it's hard. However, since we have QN parallel to PO, which is along the x-axis. So line QN must also be horizontal. Let me assume that. 

So, if PO is horizontal (from O(0,0) to P(a,0)), then QN is horizontal. Let me assume that QN is horizontal, so points Q and N have the same y-coordinate. 

Now, let's think about triangle QNO. It has points Q, N, O. Since O is at (0,0), and N is somewhere. Given that NO = 3.6, which is the length from N to O. So, if O is (0,0), then N is at some point (b,c) such that the distance from N to O is sqrt(b² + c²) = 3.6. But since QN is horizontal, Q and N have the same y-coordinate. Let's say N is (d, e), then Q would be (f, e) such that the distance between Q and N is |f - d| = QN. 

But I'm getting too abstract. Maybe I need to find relations between the coordinates. 

Alternatively, since QN || PO, which is horizontal, so QN is horizontal. Then, the slope of QN is zero, same as PO. 

Now, let's consider triangle MPO. Points M, P, O. We know MP = 5, MO = 6. Let me assign coordinates. Let’s fix O at (0,0), P at (p, 0) since PO is along x-axis. Then M is a point such that MO = 6, so M lies somewhere on a circle of radius 6 centered at O. And MP = 5, so the distance from M to P is 5. 

Let me denote coordinates: O(0,0), P(p, 0), M(x,y). Then:

MO = √(x² + y²) = 6 → x² + y² = 36.

MP = √[(x - p)^2 + y^2] = 5 → (x - p)^2 + y² = 25.

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives:

(x - p)^2 + y² - (x² + y²) = 25 - 36 → x² - 2px + p² - x² = -11 → -2px + p² = -11 → 2px = p² + 11 → x = (p² + 11)/(2p).

This relates x-coordinate of M to p. But without knowing p, we can't proceed further. 

However, we might need another condition. Perhaps the fact that QN || PO implies something about the position of Q and N. 

Let me think about triangle QNO. Since QN is parallel to PO, which is horizontal, so QN is horizontal. Let me assume that N is at (n_x, n_y), and Q is at (q_x, n_y) since QN is horizontal. The length of QN is |q_x - n_x|. Also, the length of NO is 3.6, which is the distance from N to O(0,0):

√(n_x² + n_y²) = 3.6 → n_x² + n_y² = (3.6)^2 = 12.96.

Now, we need to relate this to other parts. But how?

Maybe considering that the line QN is parallel to PO. Since PO is horizontal, QN is horizontal. Now, what connects these triangles? Perhaps line QP? The question asks for QP, which is the distance between Q and P. 

If I can express Q in terms of other variables, maybe using the parallelism. 

Alternatively, since QN || PO, and assuming that line QP intersects PO at some point, creating similar triangles. Wait, but without knowing where Q is, it's challenging. 

Wait, maybe using vectors. Let me consider vector PO = P - O = (p, 0) - (0,0) = (p, 0). Vector QN = N - Q = (n_x - q_x, n_y - n_y) = (n_x - q_x, 0). Since they are parallel, vector QN is scalar multiple of vector PO. So, (n_x - q_x, 0) = k*(p, 0) for some scalar k. Hence, n_x - q_x = kp and 0 = 0. Therefore, q_x = n_x - kp. 

But we also know that the length of QN is |n_x - q_x| = |kp| * |p| ? Wait, no. Wait, vector QN is (n_x - q_x, 0), so its magnitude is |n_x - q_x|. Since it's parallel to PO, which has magnitude |p|. So the ratio of QN to PO is |n_x - q_x| / |p| = k. 

But I don't know k. However, we might relate this to triangle QNO. 

Alternatively, since we have triangle QNO with NO = 3.6. From earlier, n_x² + n_y² = 12.96. Also, QN is horizontal, so Q is (q_x, n_y). The length QN is |n_x - q_x|. 

But how to find q_x? Maybe through another relation. 

Wait, perhaps there's a connection between triangles MPO and QNO via the parallel lines. If QN || PO, and if there's a transversal connecting M to Q, or something like that. 

Alternatively, since QN || PO, then the ratio of QN to PO is equal to the ratio of QO to MO. Wait, if that's true, then QN / PO = QO / MO. 

Let me test this idea. If triangles QNO and MPO are similar, then QN / MP = NO / PO = QO / MO. But earlier, I was trying to assume similarity. Let me check if that holds. 

If QN || PO, then the triangles QNO and MPO might be similar if the angles are equal. Assuming that, then the ratio would hold. 

So, if QN / MP = NO / PO, and we know MP = 5, NO = 3.6, and MO = 6. Let me denote PO as x (but wait, PO is a side of triangle MPO; we don't know its length yet. Wait, but maybe we can find PO using the Law of Cosines in triangle MPO?

Wait, in triangle MPO, we have sides MO = 6, MP = 5, and PO is unknown. But without knowing the angle between them, we can't compute PO directly. Unless there's another way. 

Wait, but if we assume similarity between triangles QNO and MPO, then QN / MP = NO / PO. So, QN / 5 = 3.6 / PO. Also, from QO / MO = NO / PO => QO / 6 = 3.6 / PO. 

But we also have QN = |n_x - q_x|, and QO is the distance from Q to O, which is sqrt(q_x² + n_y²). 

But I'm stuck here because I don't know QO or QN. 

Wait, but the question asks for QP, which is the distance between Q and P. If I can find Q's coordinates in terms of other variables, maybe I can compute QP. 

Let me try to combine these equations. Assume similarity between QNO and MPO. So, QN / MP = NO / PO = QO / MO. 

From QN / 5 = 3.6 / PO => QN = (3.6 * 5)/PO = 18 / PO. 

From QO / 6 = 3.6 / PO => QO = (3.6 * 6)/PO = 21.6 / PO. 

So QO = 21.6 / PO. 

But QO is the distance from Q to O, which is sqrt(q_x² + n_y²) = 21.6 / PO. 

Also, QN is |n_x - q_x| = 18 / PO. 

Additionally, from earlier, NO = 3.6, which is sqrt(n_x² + n_y²) = 3.6. Squaring gives n_x² + n_y² = 12.96. 

Now, QN = |n_x - q_x| = 18 / PO. 

And QO = sqrt(q_x² + n_y²) = 21.6 / PO. 

So, squaring QO: q_x² + n_y² = (21.6)^2 / PO². 

But from n_x² + n_y² = 12.96, so subtracting these two equations:

(q_x² + n_y²) - (n_x² + n_y²) = [ (21.6)^2 / PO² ] - 12.96 

=> q_x² - n_x² = (466.56 / PO² ) - 12.96 

But also, QN = |n_x - q_x| = 18 / PO => (n_x - q_x)^2 = 324 / PO² 

Expanding (n_x - q_x)^2 = n_x² - 2n_x q_x + q_x² = 324 / PO² 

But from above, q_x² - n_x² = [ (466.56 / PO² ) - 12.96 ]

Which is -(n_x² - q_x²) = ... 

Wait, maybe rearranging terms. Let me denote A = q_x² - n_x² = (466.56 / PO² ) - 12.96 

And also, n_x² - 2n_x q_x + q_x² = 324 / PO² 

So, substituting A into this: (q_x² + n_x²) - 2n_x q_x = 324 / PO² 

Wait, no, expanding (n_x - q_x)^2 = n_x² - 2n_x q_x + q_x² = (q_x² + n_x²) - 2n_x q_x = 324 / PO² 

But from earlier, q_x² - n_x² = (466.56 / PO² ) - 12.96 

Let me call this Equation (1): q_x² - n_x² = 466.56 / PO² - 12.96 

And Equation (2): q_x² + n_x² - 2n_x q_x = 324 / PO² 

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I need another approach. 

Wait, perhaps I can find PO from triangle MPO. If I can find PO, then I can use that to find QN and QO. But how?

In triangle MPO, we have sides MO = 6, MP = 5, and PO. To find PO, we need more information. But maybe using the fact that QN || PO and the previous relations. 

Alternatively, if I assume that triangles MPO and QNO are similar, then the ratio of sides would give us PO. Let me try that. 

Assume similarity: QN / MP = NO / PO = QO / MO 

So, QN / 5 = 3.6 / PO = QO / 6 

Let me call the ratio k = QN / 5 = 3.6 / PO = QO / 6 

Thus, QN = 5k, QO = 6k, and PO = 3.6 / k 

Now, since QN is parallel to PO, and assuming that the triangles are similar, the ratio k would also relate to the direction of the lines. 

But how does this help us find QP? QP is the distance between Q and P. 

If we can express QP in terms of other quantities. 

Let me think about coordinates again. Suppose O is at (0,0), P is at (PO, 0), so PO is the length we want to find. 

Point M is somewhere such that MO = 6 and MP = 5. Let's assume coordinates for M. Let me choose coordinates for simplicity. 

Let me assume that triangle MPO is such that O is (0,0), P is (c, 0), and M is (d, e). Then MO = 6: d² + e² = 36. MP = 5: (d - c)^2 + e² = 25. Subtracting gives: (d - c)^2 + e² - (d² + e²) = 25 - 36 → -2cd + c² = -11 → 2cd = c² + 11 → d = (c² + 11)/(2c). 

Now, for triangle QNO, with NO = 3.6. Let me assume that N is at (x, y), so that distance from N to O is sqrt(x² + y²) = 3.6. Also, QN is parallel to PO, which is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (c, 0). So QN is horizontal, hence Q has the same y-coordinate as N. Let's say N is (a, b), so Q is (q, b), making QN length |q - a|. 

Then, since QN || PO, and PO is horizontal, this holds. 

Now, the similarity assumption says QN / MP = NO / PO. So QN / 5 = 3.6 / PO. So QN = (3.6 / PO)*5 = 18 / PO. 

But QN is |q - a| = 18 / PO. 

Also, QO is the distance from Q to O: sqrt(q² + b²) = QO. 

From similarity, QO / MO = 3.6 / PO → QO = (3.6 / PO) * MO = (3.6 / PO) * 6 = 21.6 / PO. 

Thus, sqrt(q² + b²) = 21.6 / PO. 

Also, NO is sqrt(a² + b²) = 3.6 → a² + b² = 12.96. 

Now, we have two equations:

1. q² + b² = (21.6 / PO)^2 
2. a² + b² = 12.96 

Subtracting 2 from 1: q² - a² = (21.6 / PO)^2 - 12.96 

Also, QN is |q - a| = 18 / PO → (q - a)^2 = 324 / PO² 

Expand (q - a)^2 = q² - 2aq + a² = 324 / PO² 

From earlier, q² - a² = (21.6 / PO)^2 - 12.96 → q² = a² + (21.6 / PO)^2 - 12.96 

Substitute into the expanded (q - a)^2:

[a² + (21.6 / PO)^2 - 12.96] - 2aq + a² = 324 / PO² 

Simplify: 2a² + (21.6 / PO)^2 - 12.96 - 2aq = 324 / PO² 

Rearranged: 2a² - 2aq = 324 / PO² - (21.6 / PO)^2 + 12.96 

This seems very complex, but maybe there's another way. 

Alternatively, since QN = |q - a| = 18 / PO, and from the coordinates of N, a² + b² = 12.96. Also, from QO = 21.6 / PO, so q² + b² = (21.6 / PO)^2. 

Let me subtract the two equations: (q² + b²) - (a² + b²) = (21.6 / PO)^2 - 12.96 → q² - a² = (21.6 / PO)^2 - 12.96 

But also, from QN = |q - a| = 18 / PO → (q - a)^2 = 324 / PO² 

Expanding (q - a)^2 = q² - 2aq + a² = 324 / PO² 

So, combining with q² - a² = (21.6 / PO)^2 - 12.96 

Let me add these two equations:

(q² - a²) + (q² - 2aq + a²) = [(21.6 / PO)^2 - 12.96] + 324 / PO² 

Simplifying left side: 2q² - 2aq 

Right side: (21.6² + 324) / PO² - 12.96 

Calculate 21.6²: 21.6 * 21.6 = 466.56 

So right side: (466.56 + 324) / PO² - 12.96 = 790.56 / PO² - 12.96 

Thus, 2q² - 2aq = 790.56 / PO² - 12.96 

Not sure if helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to find PO from triangle MPO. Let's try to find PO using the Law of Cosines. 

In triangle MPO, we have sides MO = 6, MP = 5, and PO. Let me denote PO as x. Then, by the Law of Cosines:

x² = MO² + MP² - 2*MO*MP*cos(theta), where theta is the angle at O. But we don't know theta. 

Alternatively, if we can find another relation involving x. 

Wait, but from the earlier similarity assumption, we have QN = 18/x and QO = 21.6/x. Also, QO is the distance from Q to O, which is sqrt(q² + b²) = 21.6/x. 

But without knowing q or b, it's difficult. 

Wait, but perhaps there's another relation. Since QN is parallel to PO, and QN is part of triangle QNO, maybe there's a relation between QP and other sides. 

Wait, QP is the distance between Q and P. If I can express QP in terms of other quantities. 

Let me think: Q is at (q, b), P is at (c, 0). So QP distance is sqrt((q - c)^2 + b^2). 

But how to find this? 

From earlier, q² + b² = (21.6 / x)^2, where x is PO. Also, c is the x-coordinate of P, which is x (since PO is x, and P is at (x, 0)). 

So QP^2 = (q - x)^2 + b^2 = q² - 2qx + x² + b² = (q² + b²) - 2qx + x² = (21.6/x)^2 - 2qx + x². 

But I don't know qx. 

Alternatively, from earlier, q² - a² = (21.6/x)^2 - 12.96. Also, a is the x-coordinate of N, which satisfies a² + b² = 12.96. 

But this is getting too tangled. Maybe I need to take a different approach. 

Let me recall that in similar triangles, the ratio of corresponding sides is constant. If triangles QNO and MPO are similar, then QN / MP = NO / PO = QO / MO. 

From this, QN / 5 = 3.6 / x = QO / 6. 

Let me denote the ratio as k, so QN = 5k, QO = 6k, and x = 3.6 / k. 

Now, QP is the distance between Q and P. Let me try to express QP in terms of k. 

If Q is part of triangle QNO, and P is part of triangle MPO. But how? 

Alternatively, since QN is parallel to PO, and if we consider the vector from Q to P, maybe it relates to the vectors of QN and MO. 

Wait, this is getting too vague. Maybe I should try plugging in the answer choices to see which fits. 

The options are A. 2, B. 3.6, C. 5, D. 6. 

Let me assume that QP is one of these values and see if it fits. 

For example, let's say QP is 5 (option C). Would that make sense? 

Alternatively, if QN is parallel to PO, and if QP is 5, then perhaps there's a direct relation. 

Wait, but I need a better way. Let me try using mass point or area ratios. 

Wait, since QN || PO, the distance between these lines is constant. The height from Q to PO would be the same as the height from N to PO? Not sure. 

Alternatively, since QN || PO, the ratio of QN to PO is the same as the ratio of the heights from Q and N to the line PO. 

But without knowing heights, it's still unclear. 

Wait, let me think about vectors again. Let me assume that vector QN is a scalar multiple of vector PO. So, QN = λ * PO. 

Vector PO is P - O = P - 0 = P. So QN = λP. 

But QN is also N - Q. So N - Q = λP → N = Q + λP. 

Now, the length of QN is |λ| * |P|. 

Also, the length of NO is 3.6, which is the distance from N to O. Since N = Q + λP, then:

|N - O| = |Q + λP| = 3.6. 

But O is the origin, so |N| = 3.6. 

So |Q + λP| = 3.6. 

Also, the length of QP is |Q - P|. 

Our goal is to find |Q - P|. 

But we need more relations. Let me see. 

We also know that in triangle MPO, MP = 5, MO = 6. 

Let me express M in terms of vectors. Let me assume O is origin. Let me denote vectors as follows: 

Let me denote vector O as 0. 

Vector P is P, vector M is M, vector Q is Q, vector N is N. 

From earlier, N = Q + λP. 

Also, since QN || PO, which is vector PO = P - O = P, so QN = N - Q = λP. 

Now, let's use the given lengths. 

First, MO = |M| = 6. 

Second, MP = |M - P| = 5. 

Third, NO = |N| = 3.6. 

Fourth, QN = |λ| * |P| = |λ| * |P|. 

Also, we need to find QP = |Q - P|. 

Let me try to relate these. 

From N = Q + λP, we have N = Q + λP → Q = N - λP. 

Then, QP = |Q - P| = |N - λP - P| = |N - (λ + 1)P|. 

But I don't know N or P. 

But we know |N| = 3.6. 

Also, from MO = 6 and MP = 5, we can write:

|M| = 6 and |M - P| = 5. 

This gives us:

|M|² = 36 → M · M = 36 

|M - P|² = 25 → (M - P) · (M - P) = 25 → M · M - 2M · P + P · P = 25 → 36 - 2M·P + |P|² = 25 → |P|² - 2M·P = -11. 

But without knowing M·P or |P|, it's still complex. 

But maybe we can find |P| from this? Let's denote |P| as x (which is PO). So x² - 2M·P = -11. 

But we don't know M·P. 

Alternatively, if we assume that M and P are related in some way. 

Wait, but this seems too abstract. Maybe there's a simpler way. 

Let me think back to the original problem. We have two triangles with a shared point O, and two lines parallel. The given lengths are MP = 5, MO = 6, NO = 3.6, and we need QP. 

If I consider the triangles MPO and QNO, with QN || PO, then by the Basic Proportionality Theorem (Thales' theorem), if a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle, it divides the other two sides proportionally. 

But how to apply this here? 

Let me imagine extending lines to form a triangle. If QN is parallel to PO, and if we consider a line from Q to M, or something like that. 

Alternatively, if we consider triangle MPO and a line QN parallel to PO, then maybe the line QN intersects MO at some point, creating proportional segments. 

Wait, but I don't know where Q is. 

Wait, maybe considering that QN is parallel to PO, so the ratio of QN to PO is equal to the ratio of QO to MO. 

From similar triangles, if QN || PO, then QN/PO = QO/MO. 

So QN/PO = QO/6. 

But we also have from triangle QNO: NO = 3.6. 

If we can relate QO and NO. 

Wait, in triangle QNO, using the Law of Cosines or something. 

But without knowing angles, it's hard. 

Wait, but if QN || PO, then the angle between QN and QO is equal to the angle between PO and PO? No, that doesn't make sense. 

Wait, let me try to think of it as similar triangles. If QN || PO, then triangles QNO and MPO are similar. 

So QN/MP = NO/PO = QO/MO. 

From this, QN/5 = 3.6/PO = QO/6. 

Let me denote PO as x. Then, QN = (3.6/x)*5 = 18/x. 

And QO = (3.6/x)*6 = 21.6/x. 

Now, QP is the distance between Q and P. Let me try to find QP in terms of x. 

Let me consider the coordinates again. Let me assume O is at (0,0), P is at (x, 0). 

Point Q is somewhere such that QO = 21.6/x. Let me assume Q is at (a, b), so that sqrt(a² + b²) = 21.6/x. 

Also, QN is parallel to PO, which is along the x-axis. So QN is horizontal, so N has the same y-coordinate as Q. Let me say N is at (c, b), so that QN is from Q(a, b) to N(c, b), so length QN = |c - a| = 18/x. 

Also, NO is the distance from N to O: sqrt(c² + b²) = 3.6 → c² + b² = 12.96. 

Now, we have two equations:

1. a² + b² = (21.6/x)^2 
2. c² + b² = 12.96 

Subtracting 2 from 1: a² - c² = (21.6/x)^2 - 12.96 

Also, QN = |c - a| = 18/x → (c - a)^2 = 324/x² 

Expand (c - a)^2 = c² - 2ac + a² = 324/x² 

From a² - c² = (21.6/x)^2 - 12.96 → a² = c² + (21.6/x)^2 - 12.96 

Substitute into the expanded (c - a)^2:

[c² + (21.6/x)^2 - 12.96] - 2ac + a² = 324/x² 

Wait, no, it's c² - 2ac + a² = 324/x². But a² = c² + (21.6/x)^2 - 12.96. Substituting:

c² - 2ac + [c² + (21.6/x)^2 - 12.96] = 324/x² 

Simplify: 2c² - 2ac + (21.6/x)^2 - 12.96 = 324/x² 

Rearrange: 2c² - 2ac = 324/x² - (21.6/x)^2 + 12.96 

This still leaves us with too many variables. 

But maybe we can find x from triangle MPO. 

In triangle MPO, we have MO = 6, MP = 5, and PO = x. Using the Law of Cosines:

x² = MO² + MP² - 2*MO*MP*cos(theta), where theta is the angle at O. 

But without knowing theta, we can't proceed. 

However, if we assume that the triangles MPO and QNO are similar, then the ratio of sides would give us x. 

From earlier, QN = 18/x, and QN is also the length from Q to N, which is |c - a|. 

But how to relate this to x? 

Wait, let me think: if triangles MPO and QNO are similar, then the ratio of their corresponding sides should be equal. 

So, MP/QN = MO/QO = PO/NO. 

From this, MP/QN = MO/QO → 5/(18/x) = 6/(21.6/x) → 5x/18 = 6x/21.6. 

Simplify: 5x/18 = 6x/21.6. 

Divide both sides by x (assuming x ≠ 0): 5/18 = 6/21.6. 

Check if this is true: 6/21.6 = 6/(21.6) = 6/(21.6) = 1/3.6 ≈ 0.2778. 

5/18 ≈ 0.2778. Yes! So 5/18 = 6/21.6. 

Because 6 divided by 21.6 is 6 / 21.6 = 6 / (21.6) = multiply numerator and denominator by 10: 60 / 216 = 5/18. 

Yes! So this confirms that the similarity holds. 

Therefore, our assumption of similarity is valid. 

Now, since the triangles are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides is consistent. 

Now, we need to find QP, which is the distance between Q and P. 

Let me recall that Q is at (a, b), P is at (x, 0). So QP = sqrt((a - x)^2 + b^2). 

From earlier, a² + b² = (21.6/x)^2. 

So QP^2 = (a - x)^2 + b^2 = a² - 2ax + x² + b^2 = (a² + b^2) - 2ax + x² = (21.6/x)^2 - 2ax + x². 

But we need to find ax. 

From earlier, in the equation 2c² - 2ac = 324/x² - (21.6/x)^2 + 12.96. 

But this seems too complex. Let me think differently. 

Since QN is parallel to PO, and QN = 18/x, and PO = x. 

Also, from the coordinates of N: c² + b² = 12.96. 

And from QO: a² + b² = (21.6/x)^2. 

So, a² - c² = (21.6/x)^2 - 12.96. 

Also, QN = |c - a| = 18/x → c - a = ±18/x. 

Let me assume c > a, so c = a + 18/x. 

Substitute into a² - c² = (21.6/x)^2 - 12.96:

a² - (a + 18/x)^2 = (21.6/x)^2 - 12.96 

Expand: a² - (a² + 36a/x + (18/x)^2) = (21.6/x)^2 - 12.96 

Simplify: -36a/x - (18/x)^2 = (21.6/x)^2 - 12.96 

Rearrange: -36a/x = (21.6/x)^2 + (18/x)^2 - 12.96 

Compute the right-hand side:

(21.6^2 + 18^2)/x^2 - 12.96 

Calculate 21.6^2 = 466.56, 18^2 = 324 → total is 466.56 + 324 = 790.56 

So RHS
