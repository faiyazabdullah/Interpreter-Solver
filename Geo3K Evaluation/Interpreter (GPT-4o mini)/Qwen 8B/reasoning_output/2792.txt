====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, the question is asking for the measure of angle 3, given that angle 4 equals angle 5. The answer choices are A to D. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and see how they relate to each other.

Let me start by listing out all the given information. There are several angle measures and lengths mentioned. Let me note them down:

Angles:
- Measure of Angle(B,E,F) is 63 degrees.
- Measure of Angle(E,F,B) is 69 degrees.
- Measure of Angle(A,F,G) is 47 degrees.
- Measure of Angle(G,A,F) is 36 degrees.

Lengths:
- Length of Line(B,E) is 2 units.
- Length of Line(E,F) is 1 unit.
- Length of Line(F,B) is 5 units.
- Length of Line(B,C) is 4 units.
- Length of Line(F,C) is 3 units.
- Length of Line(D,A) is 6 units.
- Length of Line(D,G) is 7 units.

Wait, but where are points A, B, C, D, E, F, G located? The problem mentions various lines and angles, so maybe there are triangles or intersecting lines here. Let me try to visualize or sketch a rough diagram based on the given data.

First, looking at the angles involving points B, E, F. For example, Angle(B,E,F) is 63°, and Angle(E,F,B) is 69°. These two angles share the side EF. Wait, Angle(B,E,F) would be at point E, between BE and EF. Similarly, Angle(E,F,B) is at point F, between EF and FB. Hmm, so triangle BEF has angles at E, F, and B?

Wait, if we consider triangle BEF, the sum of its internal angles should be 180°. Let me check. At point E, angle BEF is 63°, at point F, angle EFB is 69°, so the third angle at point B would be 180 - 63 - 69 = 48°. But wait, the given data doesn't mention angle at B for triangle BEF. However, perhaps there's another triangle involved here.

Alternatively, maybe points B, E, F form a triangle with these angles. Wait, but the angle at E is 63°, angle at F is 69°, so angle at B would be 180 - 63 - 69 = 48°, which isn't directly given. But maybe that's part of a larger structure.

Then there are angles involving A, F, G. Angle(A,F,G) is 47°, and Angle(G,A,F) is 36°. So those are angles at F and A respectively. So triangle AFG has angles at F (47°), at A (36°), making the third angle at G equal to 180 - 47 - 36 = 97°. Again, not sure yet how this connects to other parts.

Now, looking at the lengths. For instance, BE is 2, EF is 1, FB is 5. So triangle BEF has sides BE=2, EF=1, FB=5? Wait, but in a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. Here, BE + EF = 2 + 1 = 3, which is less than FB=5. That's impossible! Oh, that suggests that points B, E, F cannot form a triangle because the triangle inequality fails. Therefore, there must be some misunderstanding here.

Wait, maybe the points are not connected in a straight line. Maybe they are arranged such that E is between B and F? No, because then BE + EF would be BF. But given BE=2, EF=1, then BF should be 3, but it's stated as 5. So that contradicts. Alternatively, could there be a typo? Or maybe the points are not colinear? Wait, but the length of BF is given as 5, while BE and EF are 2 and 1. So unless the points are not in a straight line, but forming a triangle with those sides. But triangle inequality says that 2 + 1 > 5? No, 3 is not greater than 5. Therefore, this seems impossible. So perhaps my initial assumption about the configuration is wrong.

Wait, maybe the points are not in a straight line. Let me think again. Points B, E, F—maybe they are not colinear. So triangle BEF has sides BE=2, EF=1, and BF=5. But even so, the triangle inequality requires that the sum of BE and EF (2+1=3) must be greater than BF=5, which it isn't. Therefore, there's something wrong here. Maybe the given data is inconsistent? Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the points' arrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the points are not all part of the same triangle. Maybe E and F are points connected to B via different paths. For example, B connected to E and F, but E and F are separate points. Then, triangle BEF may not exist. Alternatively, maybe the given angles are not internal angles of a triangle. For example, angle at E between BE and EF, but EF is not connected to B. Wait, if E is connected to F and B, then angle at E would be between BE and EF, which would make triangle BEF. But again, the sides don't satisfy triangle inequality.

This inconsistency suggests that perhaps the problem involves more complex structures, like intersecting lines or other polygons. Maybe there are other points involved. For example, points C, D, G are also mentioned. Let me check the other lengths. For example, BC is 4, FC is 3. So point C is connected to B and F. Then, triangle BFC has sides BF=5, BC=4, FC=3. Wait, 3-4-5 triangle! Yes, that works. Because 3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5². So triangle BFC is a right triangle with right angle at C? Because 3-4-5 is a classic Pythagorean triple. So angle at C is 90 degrees. Interesting.

So triangle BFC is right-angled at C. Therefore, angle at C is 90°, which might be useful later.

Now, moving on to other points. DA is 6, DG is 7. So points D connected to A and G. Not sure yet.

But back to the triangle BEF issue. Since BE=2, EF=1, BF=5, which violates the triangle inequality. Therefore, perhaps points E and F are not connected directly? Or maybe the segments BE, EF, and FB are not all sides of a triangle. Perhaps they are parts of different triangles?

Alternatively, maybe E and F are points on different lines connected to B. For example, B connected to E and F, but E and F are not connected. In that case, angles at E and F would involve other points. Wait, the angles given are Angle(B,E,F)=63°, which would mean that at point E, the angle between BE and EF is 63°, implying that E is connected to B and F. Similarly, Angle(E,F,B)=69° means at point F, the angle between FE and FB is 69°, which would imply that F is connected to E and B. So that does suggest that BE, EF, and FB form a triangle, but since the sides do not satisfy the triangle inequality, there's a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the problem uses directed segments or vectors, or maybe the angles are not internal angles of a triangle?

Wait, maybe the angles are not internal angles. For example, if the lines are extended beyond the segments. Suppose BE and EF are parts of longer lines, creating angles outside the triangle. But without knowing the full configuration, it's hard to tell. This is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the given lengths are not Euclidean distances but something else? Unlikely, since the problem refers to LengthOf(Line(...)).

Hmm. Maybe I need to focus on other parts first. Let's look at triangle AFG. Angles at F is 47°, at A is 36°, so angle at G is 180 - 47 - 36 = 97°, as before. Also, DA is 6, DG is 7. So D is connected to A and G. Maybe triangle ADG? Not sure yet.

Also, the question refers to angles 3, 4, 5. The problem statement doesn't specify which angles correspond to numbers 3, 4, 5, but likely they refer to certain angles in the diagram based on standard numbering conventions. However, without seeing the diagram, this is tricky. But maybe the labels are inferred from the given angles.

Given that the answer depends on the relationship between angles 3, 4, and 5, with angle 4 = angle 5, perhaps we can find relationships using triangle properties or parallel lines, etc.

Alternatively, maybe angles 3, 4, 5 are part of a triangle or transversal lines.

Another thought: Since there are several triangles mentioned (like BFC being right-angled), maybe we can use properties of those triangles to find other angles.

For instance, in triangle BFC, right-angled at C, angles at B and F can be calculated. Since BC=4, FC=3, BF=5. So tan(angle at B) = opposite/adjacent = FC / BC = 3/4. Therefore, angle at B is arctan(3/4). Let me calculate that. Arctan(3/4) is approximately 36.87 degrees. Similarly, angle at F would be arctan(BC/FC) = 4/3, which is arctan(4/3) ≈ 53.13 degrees. Adding those gives 36.87 + 53.13 ≈ 90°, which checks out.

But how does this connect to other parts? For example, angle at B in triangle BFC is approx 36.87°, but earlier we had angles involving point B in triangle BEF. However, since triangle BEF seems invalid due to the side lengths, maybe there's a different configuration.

Wait, maybe points E and F are connected to B and C? Like, E is connected to B and C, and F is connected to B and C? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps points E and F are on different lines connected to B.

Alternatively, considering that angle at B in triangle BFC is approx 36.87°, which is close to the given angle of 36° in angle(G,A,F). Maybe there's a connection here?

But this is getting too speculative. Let me try to re-express the problem with what I know.

We have several triangles:

1. Triangle BFC: Right-angled at C, with sides 3,4,5. Angles at B ≈ 36.87°, at F ≈ 53.13°.

2. Triangle AFG: Angles at F=47°, at A=36°, so angle at G=97°.

Other elements:

- BE=2, EF=1, FB=5. Despite the triangle inequality issue, maybe the points are arranged differently. For example, if E and F are not connected, but lines BE and BF extend to meet at E and F, creating some other configuration.

Alternatively, maybe the angles given are not in the same triangle. For example, angle at E between BE and EF is 63°, and angle at F between EF and FB is 69°, which would imply that lines BE and FB form some kind of 'V' shape with EF in between. But since the lengths BE=2, EF=1, and FB=5 don't form a triangle, perhaps they are parts of different structures.

Wait, maybe the lines BE and BF are not connected directly, but EF is another segment. For example, imagine point B connected to E and F, with E and F connected to each other. Then, triangle BEF would require BE + EF ≥ BF, but 2+1=3 < 5, so it's not possible. Hence, this suggests that either the problem has incorrect data, or I'm missing something.

Perhaps the angles given are not internal angles of a triangle but rather external or something else. For example, maybe the lines are not straight, or there are overlapping lines?

Alternatively, maybe the points are arranged such that E and F are on different lines extending from B. For example, BE and BF are two different lines from B, with E and F lying on those lines, and EF connecting them. Then, the angle between BE and EF is 63°, and between EF and BF is 69°, which would make the total angle at B between BE and BF equal to 63 + 69 = 132°. Wait, but in that case, the angle at B would be 132°, but earlier in triangle BFC, we had angle at B ≈ 36.87°, which is conflicting. Unless these are different angles at point B.

Ah, this might be the case. So point B has multiple connections: one to E, one to F, and one to C. So the angle between BE and BF is 132°, but the angle between BE and BC is different. So the 36.87° angle at B in triangle BFC is a different angle.

Therefore, the angle between BE and BF is 63° + 69° = 132°, as per the angles given. Now, if we can relate this to other angles in the diagram.

Additionally, there are lengths BE=2, EF=1, BF=5. Even though BE + EF < BF, maybe they're not along the same line. For example, suppose BE is a horizontal line from B to E, and BF is some other direction from B to F, and E and F are connected by a line EF of length 1. So the triangle BEF is not a straight line, but a triangle with BE=2, EF=1, BF=5. But even so, the triangle inequality still requires that BE + EF > BF. Which isn't satisfied here. So this is perplexing.

Maybe the given lengths are not Euclidean distances but something else? Or maybe the problem is in non-Euclidean geometry? Unlikely, since it's a typical geometry problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the lengths are not straight-line distances but something else, like projections or something. But without further info, this is unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, and the length of BF is actually 3 instead of 5? Or maybe BE is 3? But assuming the given data is correct, I have to work with it.

Alternatively, maybe the points are not in a plane? But that's unlikely for a standard geometry problem.

At this point, maybe focusing on the parts that make sense, like triangle BFC, and trying to find relations between angles.

In triangle BFC, right-angled at C, angles at B and F are approx 36.87° and 53.13°. 

Looking at other angles given: angle at A,F,G is 47°, angle at G,A,F is 36°, so angle at G is 97°, as before. Also, angle at A,F,G is 47°, which might be part of triangle AFG.

Now, the question asks for angle 3, given that angle 4 = angle 5. Assuming that angles 3, 4, 5 are labeled in the diagram, possibly in relation to triangles or lines.

Since the problem includes points D, A, G with DA=6 and DG=7, perhaps triangle DAG? Or D connected to A and G, forming a triangle. But without knowing the angles, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe angles 4 and 5 are corresponding angles or alternate interior angles due to parallel lines, leading to their equality. If angle 4 and 5 are equal, then maybe they are base angles of an isosceles triangle or part of a parallelogram.

Alternatively, maybe angle 4 and 5 are vertical angles or something similar.

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging. However, given the answer choices are around 116-146, which are obtuse angles, suggesting that angle 3 is likely an exterior angle or supplementary to some other angle.

Another approach: Since there are several angles given, maybe angle 3 is related to the angles in triangle AFG or BFC.

For example, if angle 3 is an exterior angle to triangle AFG, it might be equal to the sum of two remote interior angles. But without knowing which angle it is, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, if angle 3 is part of a triangle where angles 4 and 5 are base angles, and since they are equal, it's an isosceles triangle. For example, if angle 3 is the vertex angle, then it would be 180 - 2*angle4. But we need to find angle 3.

But since the options are high, maybe angle 3 is 180 minus some other angle. For example, if angle 3 is supplementary to an angle of 36°, giving 144°, but that's not an option. Or if it's supplementary to 47°, giving 133°, which isn't listed. Alternatively, maybe combining angles from different parts.

Wait, going back to the angles in triangle BFC: angle at B is ~36.87°, which is close to 36°, which is given as angle(G,A,F). Maybe there's a connection here. If angle at B (~36.87°) is related to angle at A (36°), perhaps there's a similarity or something.

Alternatively, since angle at A,F,G is 47°, and angle at G,A,F is 36°, which sums to 83°, leaving angle at G as 97°, as before. If angle 3 is angle at G, which is 97°, but that's not among the options. So maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe angle 3 is the supplement of angle at G, which would be 180 - 97 = 83°, which isn't in the options. Or if angle 3 is the sum of two angles, like 63° + 69° = 132°, which is close to option B (126) or C (136). Wait, 132 is not an option, but 136 is option C. Hmm.

Alternatively, if angle 3 is the sum of angle at B (from triangle BFC) and angle at F (from triangle BFC)? 36.87 + 53.13 = 90°, which is a right angle. Not helpful.

Wait, but the given angle at E,F,B is 69°, which might relate to the angle at F in triangle BFC, which was ~53.13°. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps using the Law of Sines or Cosines in triangle BEF, despite the triangle inequality issue. Let me try that.

In triangle BEF, sides BE=2, EF=1, BF=5. Using Law of Cosines on angle at E: cos(angle at E) = (BE² + EF² - BF²)/(2*BE*EF). Plugging in:

cos(angle E) = (2² + 1² - 5²)/(2*2*1) = (4 + 1 - 25)/4 = (-20)/4 = -5. So cosine of angle E is -5, which is impossible, since cosine ranges from -1 to 1. This confirms that such a triangle cannot exist. Hence, there's an inconsistency in the given data.

This suggests that there might be an error in the problem setup, but since it's presented as a valid problem, I must assume that I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the points are not in a single plane? Or maybe the lengths are not straight-line distances but something else? For example, maybe they are arc lengths or something. But that's highly unlikely in standard geometry problems.

Alternatively, maybe the given angles are not the internal angles of the triangle, but something else. For example, if E and F are points on extensions of lines, creating reflex angles?

But even then, the calculation would be problematic.

Alternatively, maybe the angles given are not in the same triangle. For example, angle at E (between BE and EF) is 63°, and angle at F (between EF and FB) is 69°, but these angles are not part of the same triangle. Instead, they could be angles formed by intersecting lines at E and F, creating some other structure.

For example, imagine lines BE and BF intersecting at B, with E and F being points on other lines. Then, the angles at E and F could be part of different triangles.

But without a diagram, it's really challenging. Given the time I've spent without progress, maybe I should focus on the parts that make sense and see if I can derive something.

Assuming that triangle BFC is right-angled at C, with angles at B ≈ 36.87°, at F ≈ 53.13°, and at C = 90°. Also, angle at A,F,G is 47°, angle at G,A,F is 36°, making angle at G = 97°.

If angle 4 and angle 5 are equal, and they are part of a triangle or some configuration, maybe they are base angles of an isosceles triangle. For example, if angle 4 and 5 are base angles, then angle 3 would be 180 - 2*angle4. But we need to find angle 3.

Suppose angle 3 is the vertex angle, and angle 4 and 5 are the base angles. If angle4 = angle5, then angle3 = 180 - 2*angle4. To find this, we need to determine angle4. But how?

Alternatively, if angle3 is an exterior angle, then it equals the sum of the two remote interior angles. For example, if angle3 is an exterior angle at a vertex, then it equals the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles.

But without knowing which angles are involved, it's hard to proceed. Let me think about the given angles.

There's angle at B,E,F = 63°, which could be an angle in a triangle or somewhere. And angle at E,F,B = 69°, which is adjacent to it? Or part of a different structure.

Alternatively, if these angles are part of a transversal or something, creating supplementary angles.

Wait, if angle at E is 63° and angle at F is 69°, and if these are consecutive angles on a line, then their sum would be supplementary to another angle. But I'm not sure.

Another idea: Since there are multiple angles given, maybe angle 3 is the sum of some of them. For example, 63 + 69 = 132°, which is close to option B (126) and C (136). But why would it be the sum? Maybe it's part of a triangle or something.

Alternatively, if angle3 is supplementary to one of the given angles. For example, 180 - 47 = 133°, which isn't an option. 180 - 36 = 144°, which is not listed. 180 - 63 = 117°, which is close to option A (116) or B (126). 180 - 69 = 111°, not listed.

Wait, but if angle3 is the supplement of angle at G (which is 97°), then 180 - 97 = 83°, not helpful. Or supplement of angle at B in triangle BFC: 180 - 36.87 ≈ 143.13°, which is close to option D (146). But this is just guessing.

Alternatively, considering that angle at B in triangle BFC is approx 36.87°, and angle at A,F,G is 47°, adding them gives 36.87 + 47 ≈ 83.87°, which is not helpful.

Another approach: Since the answer choices are 116, 126, 136, 146, these are all multiples of 10 plus 6, 6, 6, 6. Maybe angle3 is supplementary to some combination of angles.

Wait, if angle4 = angle5, and they are part of a triangle, then angle3 would be 180 - 2*angle4. If angle3 is one of the options, say 126°, then angle4 and angle5 would be (180 - 126)/2 = 27°. But I don't see where 27° comes from in the given data.

Alternatively, if angle3 is 126°, which is 180 - 54°, and 54° is something... Not sure.

Wait, the angle at F in triangle BFC is approx 53.13°, which is close to 53°, and if there's an angle of 53°, then 180 - 53 = 127°, close to option B (126). Maybe there's a rounding or approximation here.

Alternatively, if angle3 is the supplement of the angle at F in triangle BFC (approx 53.13°), then 180 - 53.13 ≈ 126.87°, which is very close to option B (126). This could be the intended solution, assuming that the given angle at F in triangle BFC is approximated as 53°, and thus the supplement is 127°, rounded to 126°.

But how does this relate to the given data? The angle at F in triangle BFC is arctan(BC/FC) = arctan(4/3) ≈ 53.13°, and if angle4 and angle5 are equal and somehow related to this angle, then angle3 could be supplementary to it.

But how to justify that angle4 and angle5 are equal to this angle?

Alternatively, maybe angle4 and angle5 are the angles at F in triangle BFC and elsewhere, hence equal, and angle3 is their supplement.

But without knowing the exact configuration, this is speculative. However, given the options and the proximity of 53.13° to 53°, and the supplement being 127°, which is closest to option B (126), this might be the intended answer.

Thus, selecting option B (126).
