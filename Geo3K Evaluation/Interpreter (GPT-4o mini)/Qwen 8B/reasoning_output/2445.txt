MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, we have some geometric predicates here, and I need to find x. Let me start by understanding what each predicate means and how they relate to each other.

First, the given predicates:

1. RightAngle(Angle(E,G,D)): This means that the angle at point G formed by points E, G, D is a right angle. So, angle EGD is 90 degrees.

2. Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(E,A,G)),45): The measure of angle EAG is 45 degrees. Wait, angle EAG would be at point A, between points E, A, G. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should draw a rough sketch mentally. Let's note down the points involved: E, G, D, A. Also, there's a Line(E,G) and Line(D,G), which are perpendicular. So, lines EG and DG are perpendicular, meeting at G. That forms a right angle at G between EG and DG.

Then, Angle(E,A,G) is 45 degrees. So, point A is somewhere such that when connected to E and G, forms a 45-degree angle at A. Similarly, Angle(A,D,G) is 30 degrees, so angle at D between points A, D, G?

Wait, maybe I need to clarify the structure. Let me think about the points and lines.

We have two lines: EG and DG, which are perpendicular. So, points E, G, D form a right angle at G. Then, there's another point A connected to E and G? Or perhaps A is connected to other points?

Also, the length of Line(E,A) is 8 units. So EA = 8. And we have angles at A: angle EAG is 45°, and angle ADG is 30°. Wait, but where is point D located? Since DG is a line, and EG is perpendicular to DG at G.

Let me try to visualize this. Let me imagine coordinate system. Let me assign coordinates to make it easier. Let me place point G at the origin (0,0). Since EG and DG are perpendicular, suppose EG is along the x-axis and DG is along the y-axis. So, point E is somewhere on the x-axis, say (a, 0), and point D is somewhere on the y-axis, say (0, b).

But wait, since EG is a line, and DG is another line, both passing through G. Now, point A is connected to E and G, forming angle EAG of 45 degrees. Also, angle ADG is 30 degrees. Maybe point A is somewhere in the plane such that lines AG and AD form those angles.

Alternatively, maybe triangle EAG has angle at A being 45°, and triangle ADG has angle at D being 30°. But I need to figure out relations between these elements.

Given that EG and DG are perpendicular, so triangle EDG is a right triangle at G. However, point A is connected to E and G, and also to D and G? Or perhaps A is connected to D and G?

Wait, angle ADG is 30°, which is at point D, between points A, D, G. So, that suggests that point A is connected to D and G. Therefore, lines DA and DG meet at D, forming a 30° angle.

So, putting this together: We have points E, G, D arranged with EG ⊥ DG at G. Point A is connected to E and G (forming angle EAG=45°) and connected to D and G (forming angle ADG=30°). Also, EA = 8 units.

Our goal is to find x. Wait, but the question says "Find x." However, the problem doesn't explicitly state what x represents. Wait, maybe x refers to the length of a certain segment, like AG or AD or something else? Since the options are numerical values, likely x is a length. But without more info, I need to infer based on standard problems.

Wait, perhaps x is the length of AG or GD or something else. Let me check again.

Looking back, the given data includes LengthOf(Line(E,A)) = 8. So EA = 8. The question asks for x. Since the answer choices are numbers, it's likely that x is a length. Maybe AG or AD?

Alternatively, maybe x is the length of DG or EG? Or perhaps the length of a side in a triangle involving these angles?

Alternatively, since there are angles given (45°, 30°, right angle), maybe we can use trigonometry to find lengths.

Let me consider triangles involving these angles. For instance, triangle EAG has angle at A of 45°, and EA is 8. If I can find other sides or angles, maybe I can compute AG or other segments.

Similarly, triangle ADG has angle at D of 30°, and DG is part of the perpendicular lines. Let me think.

Since EG and DG are perpendicular, triangle EDG is a right triangle. But how does point A come into play?

Perhaps point A lies somewhere such that lines AG and AD create those angles. Let me try to model coordinates.

Let me set up coordinates with G at (0,0). Let me assume EG is along the positive x-axis, so E is at (e, 0) for some e > 0. DG is along the positive y-axis, so D is at (0, d) for some d > 0.

Point A is somewhere in the plane. From the given, angle EAG is 45°, which is the angle at A between points E, A, G. Also, angle ADG is 30°, the angle at D between points A, D, G.

Additionally, EA = 8. So the distance from E to A is 8.

Let me denote coordinates for point A as (x, y). Then, vector AE goes from A to E: E - A = (e - x, 0 - y). Vector AG goes from A to G: G - A = (-x, -y). The angle between vectors AE and AG is 45 degrees.

Similarly, angle ADG is 30°, which involves point D, so vector DA and vector DG. Vector DA is A - D = (x - 0, y - d) = (x, y - d). Vector DG is G - D = (0 - 0, 0 - d) = (0, -d). The angle between DA and DG at D is 30 degrees.

This seems complicated, but maybe manageable with coordinate geometry.

First, let's handle angle EAG = 45°. Using vectors, the angle between AE and AG is 45 degrees. The formula for the angle θ between vectors u and v is cosθ = (u · v)/(|u| |v|).

Vector AE is E - A = (e - x, -y). Vector AG is G - A = (-x, -y). Their dot product is (e - x)(-x) + (-y)(-y) = -x(e - x) + y².

The magnitude of AE is sqrt[(e - x)^2 + y^2], which is given as 8. The magnitude of AG is sqrt[x² + y²].

Therefore, cos(45°) equals [ -x(e - x) + y² ] / [8 * sqrt(x² + y²)].

Hmm, but this seems too abstract because we don't know e or d. Maybe there's another way.

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle EAG. In triangle EAG, we know one angle (at A: 45°), and the length of EA is 8. If we could find other angles or sides, maybe via Law of Sines or Cosines.

But we need more information about the triangle. Let me see if there are other angles.

In triangle EAG, the sum of angles is 180°. At point G, what is the angle? Well, since EG is perpendicular to DG, but unless A is aligned with DG or something, we don't know. Alternatively, maybe triangle EAG relates to the right angle at G?

Wait, if EG is perpendicular to DG, but point A is not necessarily on DG. So maybe triangle EAG isn't directly related to the right angle. However, there's also angle ADG = 30°, which may involve DG.

Alternatively, maybe triangles EAG and ADG are connected through point G. Let me think.

Another idea: Since EG ⊥ DG, then lines EG and DG form a right angle at G. Suppose we consider triangle EAG and triangle DAG. Maybe there's a relation between them?

Alternatively, since angle at A is 45°, and angle at D is 30°, and EG ⊥ DG, perhaps there's a way to express AG and DG in terms of EA and other known quantities.

Wait, maybe using Law of Sines in triangle EAG. In triangle EAG, angle at A is 45°, angle at G? Let's call that angle γ, and angle at E would be 180° - 45° - γ.

But without knowing other angles, this might not help directly. Unless we can find another relationship.

Alternatively, looking at triangle ADG. In triangle ADG, angle at D is 30°, angle at G? Well, DG is perpendicular to EG, but unless AG is aligned with something, not sure.

Wait, perhaps if we can find coordinates for point A, given that EA=8 and the angles.

Let me try again with coordinates. Let me fix some variables. Let me assume that point E is at (a, 0), G is at (0,0), D is at (0,b). Then, point A is (x,y).

From EA = 8: distance between E(a,0) and A(x,y) is √[(x-a)^2 + (y-0)^2] = 8 → (x - a)^2 + y² = 64.

Now, angle EAG = 45°. Let's compute this angle. As mentioned earlier, vectors AE and AG.

AE vector is from A to E: (a - x, 0 - y)

AG vector is from A to G: (0 - x, 0 - y) = (-x, -y)

The angle between these vectors is 45°, so:

cos(45°) = [(a - x)(-x) + (-y)(-y)] / [ |AE| * |AG| ]

Which simplifies to:

[ -x(a - x) + y² ] / [8 * sqrt(x² + y²) ) ] = √2 / 2

That gives us:

[ -ax + x² + y² ] = 8 * sqrt(x² + y²) * (√2 / 2 )

Simplify RHS: 8*(√2 / 2)*sqrt(x² + y²) = 4√2 * sqrt(x² + y²)

Thus,

-xa + x² + y² = 4√2 * sqrt(x² + y²)

Let me denote s = sqrt(x² + y²), which is the length AG. Then, the equation becomes:

x² + y² - xa = 4√2 * s → s² - xa = 4√2 s.

But since s² = x² + y², so substituting:

s² - xa = 4√2 s → s² - 4√2 s - xa = 0.

Hmm, but we still have two variables here: x and a. Not helpful yet.

Now, moving to the second angle: angle ADG = 30°. Let's analyze this.

Point D is at (0, b). Vector DA is from D to A: (x - 0, y - b) = (x, y - b). Vector DG is from D to G: (0 - 0, 0 - b) = (0, -b).

The angle between DA and DG at point D is 30°, so the angle between vectors DA and DG is 30°. Using the dot product again:

cos(30°) = [DA • DG] / ( |DA| |DG| )

Compute DA • DG = (x)(0) + (y - b)(-b) = -b(y - b) = -by + b²

|DA| = sqrt(x² + (y - b)^2 )

|DG| = sqrt(0² + (-b)^2 ) = b

So:

cos(30°) = [ -by + b² ] / [ sqrt(x² + (y - b)^2 ) * b ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: b(-y + b) = b(b - y)

Denominator: b * sqrt(x² + (y - b)^2 )

Cancel b:

[ b - y ] / sqrt(x² + (y - b)^2 ) = cos(30°) = √3 / 2

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

( b - y )² / [x² + (y - b)^2 ] = 3/4

Multiply both sides by denominator:

( b - y )² = (3/4)[x² + (y - b)^2 ]

Expand left side: (b - y)^2 = 3/4 x² + 3/4 (b - y)^2

Bring terms together:

Left side minus 3/4 (left side) = 3/4 x²

=> (1 - 3/4)(b - y)^2 = 3/4 x² → (1/4)(b - y)^2 = (3/4)x² → Multiply both sides by 4:

(b - y)^2 = 3x² → Take square roots:

b - y = ±√3 x → y = b ∓ √3 x 

So, this gives us a relationship between y, b, and x.

Now, recall from before, we had the equation from angle EAG:

s² - xa = 4√2 s, where s = sqrt(x² + y²)

But we also have y = b ∓ √3 x. Let me substitute that into s² = x² + y² = x² + (b ∓ √3 x)^2 

Expanding that:

x² + b² ∓ 2b√3 x + 3x² = 4x² + b² ∓ 2b√3 x 

So, s² = 4x² + b² ∓ 2b√3 x 

Now, going back to the equation s² - xa = 4√2 s:

Substitute s²:

4x² + b² ∓ 2b√3 x - xa = 4√2 s 

But s = sqrt(x² + y²) = sqrt(s²) = sqrt(4x² + b² ∓ 2b√3 x )

This seems complicated. Perhaps there's another approach.

Alternatively, maybe we can relate the two equations we have. Let me think.

We also know that EA = 8, which was used earlier. Recall that EA squared is (x - a)^2 + y² = 64. Which expands to x² - 2ax + a² + y² = 64. But s² = x² + y² = 4x² + b² ∓ 2b√3 x (from above). So:

s² = 4x² + b² ∓ 2b√3 x 

Therefore, substituting into EA²:

x² - 2ax + a² + y² = x² - 2ax + a² + (s² - x²) ?

Wait, no. Wait, y² = s² - x². Because s² = x² + y² → y² = s² - x².

Wait, no. Wait, s² = x² + y² → y² = s² - x². So substituting into EA²:

EA² = (x - a)^2 + y² = (x - a)^2 + (s² - x²) = x² - 2ax + a² + s² - x² = -2ax + a² + s² = 64.

So:

-2ax + a² + s² = 64.

But from earlier, we had s² - xa = 4√2 s → rearranged as s² = xa + 4√2 s.

Substituting into the above equation:

-2ax + a² + xa + 4√2 s = 64 → -ax + a² + 4√2 s = 64.

So:

a² - ax + 4√2 s = 64.

But we also have from the previous equation involving b and x: y = b ∓ √3 x. However, I'm not sure how to connect this with 'a' and 'b'.

This seems getting too tangled. Maybe there's a different approach. Let me think about the entire configuration.

Since EG and DG are perpendicular, and we have angles at A and D, maybe there are right triangles involved. For example, if we can find right triangles where we can apply trigonometric ratios.

Let me consider triangle ADG. It has angle at D of 30°, and DG is perpendicular to EG. If I can find some relations here.

Assume that DG is vertical, as before. Let me suppose that point D is at (0, d), G at (0,0), E at (e, 0). Point A is somewhere in the plane.

In triangle ADG, angle at D is 30°, and we have DG = length from D to G, which is d units. Let me denote DG = d.

Using the Law of Sines in triangle ADG: sin(angle at A)/DG = sin(angle at D)/AG.

Wait, angle at D is 30°, angle at G? Let me denote the angles:

In triangle ADG, angles are:

At D: 30°

At G: let's call it θ

At A: let's call it φ

Sum to 180°: 30 + θ + φ = 180 → θ + φ = 150°

But we don't know θ or φ. However, if we can find another relationship.

Alternatively, maybe triangle ADG is part of a larger configuration.

But I'm stuck here. Let me go back to the first equation involving the angle at A (45°). Maybe if I can find AG in terms of EA.

In triangle EAG, if we can find AG, then maybe combine with other info.

Let me think about triangle EAG. It has angle at A of 45°, and side EA = 8. If I can find another angle or side.

But without more information, it's difficult. However, maybe there's a connection with triangle ADG.

Alternatively, since EG and DG are perpendicular, maybe there's a way to express coordinates such that we can relate AG and DG.

Wait, earlier I found that in triangle ADG, from the angle condition, we have y = b ∓ √3 x. Also, from the EA condition, we have (x - a)^2 + y² = 64.

Maybe I need to find relations between a and b? Or maybe assume some values to simplify?

Alternatively, since we're dealing with angles 45° and 30°, which often appear in 30-60-90 or 45-45-90 triangles, maybe there's a way to construct such triangles.

For instance, in triangle EAG, with angle 45°, if it were a 45-45-90 triangle, then legs would be equal. But since we don't know other angles, maybe not. But perhaps combining with other triangles.

Wait, if I consider that point A is such that AG forms a 45° angle with EA, and also forms some relation with DG.

Alternatively, maybe AG is the hypotenuse of a 45-45-90 triangle, making AG = EA / √2 ? No, that would be if EA was one leg, but not sure.

Wait, in triangle EAG, if angle at A is 45°, then depending on the other angles, we could use Law of Sines. For example:

Law of Sines: EA / sin(angle at G) = AG / sin(angle at E) = EG / sin(45°)

But we don't know angles at E or G, or the length of EG.

However, if we can relate EG to DG, since they are perpendicular. But again, not enough info.

Wait, but maybe if we assume that point A lies somewhere such that AG is aligned with some direction. For example, if AG is along a line making 45° with EA, but not sure.

This seems too vague. Maybe I need to take another approach.

Let me consider that since EG is perpendicular to DG, and we have angles at A and D, perhaps there's a way to express AG and DG in terms of EA and use trigonometry.

Let me try to consider triangle EAG. Let me denote AG as c, EA as 8, and EG as b. Wait, but not sure.

Alternatively, in triangle EAG, angle at A is 45°, so applying Law of Sines:

sin(angle at G)/EA = sin(45°)/AG

But I don't know angle at G.

Alternatively, if I can find angle at G in triangle EAG. How?

Well, angle at G is between EG and AG. Since EG is part of the perpendicular lines, but AG is a separate line. Without knowing where A is, hard to tell.

Wait, but if I consider the entire setup, perhaps there's a way to link these triangles.

Let me try to think differently. Since EG ⊥ DG, and we have angles involving A, maybe the total configuration creates some right triangles that we can use.

Suppose I consider triangle ADG: it has angle at D of 30°, and DG is perpendicular to EG. If I can find the length of DG, then perhaps use that with the angle to find AD or AG.

But how?

Alternatively, since DG is perpendicular to EG, and assuming that point A is such that lines AG and DG form some relation.

Wait, maybe I should look for similar triangles or use coordinate geometry with assumptions.

Let me try assigning specific coordinates to simplify. Let me assume that point G is at (0,0), point E is at (a,0), and point D is at (0,b). Let me choose specific values for a and b to make calculation easier? Or maybe set a and b to certain values based on the given conditions?

Alternatively, since we have EA = 8, maybe set a such that E is at (8,0)? Wait, but that would mean that if A is at (0,0), then EA would be 8 units. But then point A would coincide with G, which might not be the case. So probably not.

Alternatively, let me assume that point A is somewhere in the plane such that angle EAG is 45°, and angle ADG is 30°. Let me try to find coordinates for A.

Let me assume that point A is at (x, y). Then, as earlier, we have:

From angle EAG = 45°, we derived that y = b ∓ √3 x (from the angle ADG condition). And from the EA length, (x - a)^2 + y² = 64.

But without knowing a and b, this is still underdetermined. However, perhaps there's a way to relate a and b through other conditions.

Wait, maybe DG is a vertical line (since it's perpendicular to EG), and if I assume that DG is of length h, then b = h. But how does that help?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to express AG in terms of EA and the angles.

Let me think about triangle EAG. If I drop a perpendicular from A to EG, creating a right triangle. But not sure.

Wait, in triangle EAG, with angle at A of 45°, if I can find the ratio between sides.

Alternatively, suppose I let AG = m. Then, in triangle EAG, using Law of Sines:

EA / sin(angle at G) = AG / sin(angle at E) = EG / sin(45°)

But I don't know angles at E or G.

But maybe I can relate this to triangle ADG. In triangle ADG, angle at D is 30°, and if I can find some relation between AG and DG.

Let me assume that in triangle ADG, using Law of Sines:

AD / sin(angle at G) = DG / sin(angle at A) = AG / sin(30°)

But again, missing angles.

This seems like a dead end. Maybe I need to think about specific values.

Given the answer choices are A.4, B.4√2, C.4√3, D.8.

Since EA is 8, and the answer choices include multiples of √2 and √3, it's likely that x is related to these.

Let me think about possibility that AG is 4√2 or something. Let me try to assume that AG is 4√2 and see if it fits.

If AG = 4√2, then in triangle EAG, with angle at A of 45°, and EA = 8. Let's use Law of Cosines.

Law of Cosines: EG² = EA² + AG² - 2*EA*AG*cos(angle at A)

So EG² = 8² + (4√2)^2 - 2*8*(4√2)*cos(45°)

Calculate:

8² = 64

(4√2)^2 = 16*2 = 32

cos(45°) = √2/2

So:

EG² = 64 + 32 - 2*8*4√2*(√2/2)

Simplify term by term:

64 + 32 = 96

Second term: 2*8*4√2*(√2/2) = 8*4√2*(√2) = 32 * 2 = 64

So EG² = 96 - 64 = 32 → EG = √32 = 4√2

So EG = 4√2. Now, if EG is 4√2, and since EG is perpendicular to DG, then triangle EDG is a right triangle with legs EG = 4√2 and DG, and hypotenuse ED.

But how does this relate to other parts?

Now, consider triangle ADG, where angle at D is 30°, and DG is one of the legs of the right triangle EDG.

If I can find DG, then perhaps use Law of Sines or Cosines in triangle ADG.

But how to find DG? Well, if we can relate it to other parts.

Alternatively, if I assume that AG = 4√2, then in triangle ADG, with angle at D = 30°, and if I can find other sides.

But I need more info. Let me try to proceed.

In triangle ADG, angle at D is 30°, and we want to find something. If I can find DG, then using Law of Sines.

But how?

Wait, if EG is 4√2, and EG is perpendicular to DG, then if we can find DG, it might be related to other parts.

Alternatively, since we have point A connected to D and G, and angle at D is 30°, perhaps triangle ADG has some relation.

But I'm not sure. Let me think differently.

Earlier, I assumed AG = 4√2 and found that EG = 4√2. If that's the case, then in triangle EDG, which is a right triangle, with legs EG = 4√2 and DG = ?, and hypotenuse ED.

But without knowing DG, can't proceed. However, if I can relate DG to something else.

Alternatively, if I consider that in triangle ADG, with angle at D = 30°, and DG is one of the sides. Let me assume that DG is some length, say k.

Then, using Law of Sines in triangle ADG: AG / sin(30°) = DG / sin(angle at A) = AD / sin(angle at G)

But without knowing angles at A or G, not helpful.

Wait, but if I assume that AG = 4√2, then from earlier calculation, EG = 4√2. And if DG is some value, say k, then in triangle ADG, with angle at D = 30°, and side DG = k, and AG = 4√2.

If I can find angle at G in triangle ADG, then I can use Law of Sines.

But angle at G in triangle ADG is the same as the angle between AG and DG. Since DG is perpendicular to EG, and EG is part of the original right angle.

Wait, if EG and DG are perpendicular, and AG is a line from A to G, then the angle between AG and DG would depend on where A is.

But if I can relate this angle to something else...

This is getting too convoluted. Maybe my initial assumption that AG = 4√2 is correct, leading to EG = 4√2, and hence DG could be determined from other relations.

Alternatively, let me consider the possibility that x is 4√2, which is option B.

But how to confirm?

Wait, let me think about the entire configuration. If EA = 8, and angle at A is 45°, and if AG is 4√2, then in triangle EAG, the sides would be 8, 4√2, and EG = 4√2, as calculated earlier. So it forms an isoceles right triangle? Wait, no. Because in a right triangle with legs 8 and 4√2, the hypotenuse would be sqrt(8² + (4√2)^2) = sqrt(64 + 32) = sqrt(96) = 4√6. But in our calculation, EG came out as 4√2, which would mean that the triangle EAG is not a right triangle. Wait, why did we get EG = 4√2?

Because I applied the Law of Cosines with angle at A being 45°, and got EG as 4√2. So, in this scenario, triangle EAG has sides EA=8, AG=4√2, and EG=4√2, with angle at A of 45°. Let me verify this with the Law of Cosines.

Law of Cosines: EG² = EA² + AG² - 2*EA*AG*cos(angle A)

Plugging in:

EG² = 8² + (4√2)^2 - 2*8*(4√2)*cos(45°)

As before, this is 64 + 32 - 2*8*4√2*(√2/2) = 96 - 64 = 32 → EG = √32 = 4√2. Correct.

So in this case, triangle EAG has sides 8, 4√2, 4√2, and angle at A of 45°. This implies that the triangle is isoceles with AG = EG = 4√2, and base EA = 8. Wait, but in an isoceles triangle with two equal sides, the base angles are equal. Here, the equal sides are AG and EG, so the base would be EA, and the base angles would be at E and G. But the given angle is at A, which is 45°, so the other angles would be (180 - 45)/2 = 67.5°. Not sure if this helps.

But if EG = 4√2, and since EG is perpendicular to DG, then DG is another leg of the right angle at G. So, in the right triangle EDG, with legs EG = 4√2 and DG, and hypotenuse ED.

Now, let's consider triangle ADG. We have angle at D of 30°, and DG is one of the legs of the right triangle EDG.

Let me denote DG as k. Then, in triangle ADG, we have:

- One angle at D is 30°
- Side DG = k
- Side AG = 4√2 (from earlier assumption)
- Need to find relation between these.

Applying Law of Sines in triangle ADG:

AG / sin(angle at D) = DG / sin(angle at A)

Wait, angle at D is 30°, angle at A is... let's call it α, and angle at G is β.

So, α + β + 30° = 180° → α + β = 150°

From Law of Sines:

AG / sin(30°) = DG / sin(α) = AD / sin(β)

But we don't know α or β. However, if we can relate α to something else.

Note that angle at G in triangle ADG is the angle between AG and DG. Since DG is perpendicular to EG, and EG is a side of the triangle EAG, which has angle at G of 67.5° (as calculated earlier).

Wait, in triangle EAG, angle at G is 67.5°, as explained earlier. So, the angle between EG and AG is 67.5°. Since DG is perpendicular to EG, the angle between AG and DG would be 90° - 67.5° = 22.5°. 

Wait, this is crucial! Because the angle at G in triangle ADG is the angle between AG and DG. Since DG is perpendicular to EG, and the angle between EG and AG is 67.5°, then the angle between AG and DG is 90° - 67.5° = 22.5°.

So, in triangle ADG, angle at G is 22.5°, angle at D is 30°, so angle at A is 180 - 30 - 22.5 = 127.5°.

Now, applying Law of Sines in triangle ADG:

AG / sin(30°) = DG / sin(127.5°) = AD / sin(22.5°)

We know AG = 4√2, so:

4√2 / sin(30°) = DG / sin(127.5°)

Sin(30°) is 0.5, so:

4√2 / 0.5 = 8√2 = DG / sin(127.5°)

Thus, DG = 8√2 * sin(127.5°)

Now, sin(127.5°) is sin(180° - 52.5°) = sin(52.5°). What's sin(52.5°)?

52.5° is 45° + 7.5°, or alternatively, it can be expressed as 105°/2. Using half-angle identities:

sin(52.5°) = sin(105°/2) = sqrt((1 - cos(105°))/2). But this might be complex.

Alternatively, calculate numerically:

52.5° is 52.5 degrees. Let me recall that sin(45°) ≈ 0.7071, sin(60°) ≈ 0.8660. 52.5° is between them. Let me calculate sin(52.5):

Using calculator approximation: sin(52.5°) ≈ 0.7939.

So, DG ≈ 8√2 * 0.7939 ≈ 8 * 1.4142 * 0.7939 ≈ 8 * 1.122 ≈ 8.976.

But this doesn't seem to give a clean value, which makes me doubt if my assumption that AG = 4√2 is correct. Also, the answer choices don't include irrational numbers like this, suggesting that maybe my assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe there's an error in assuming AG = 4√2. Let me try a different approach.

Let me revisit the earlier equation from angle EAG. We had:

s² - xa = 4√2 s, where s = AG.

And from the EA condition, we had:

a² - ax + 4√2 s = 64.

But we also have from the angle ADG condition: y = b ∓ √3 x.

But I'm missing relations between a and b. Perhaps there's a way to relate them through the fact that DG is part of the right angle at G.

Wait, DG is a line from D to G, which is at (0,0) if I set G at (0,0). So, if D is at (0, b), then DG = b. 

Now, in triangle ADG, we have angle at D = 30°, and DG = b. Also, from earlier, we have y = b ∓ √3 x.

But y is the y-coordinate of point A, which is also related to the position of A relative to D. 

If I can express b in terms of x, or find a relation between a and b, maybe I can solve for x.

Let me consider that in the equation from the angle ADG condition: y = b ∓ √3 x. Also, from the EA condition: (x - a)^2 + y² = 64.

But I still have too many variables: a, b, x, y.

Unless there's another condition I haven't used. Wait, the right angle at G: angle EGD is 90°, which we already considered by placing G at (0,0), E at (a,0), D at (0,b).

Is there any other condition? The problem doesn't mention anything else, so perhaps I need to find another relation.

Wait, perhaps the lines EG and DG are not arbitrary; they form a right angle at G, but there's no other constraints. So, without additional info, it's impossible to determine unique values for a and b. Hence, perhaps the problem assumes that point A is positioned such that the configuration allows for a unique solution, possibly implying that a and b are chosen to satisfy all conditions.

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that point A lies on the intersection of certain loci, like the locus of points forming 45° with E and G, and 30° with D and G.

This seems too vague, but perhaps there's a standard configuration.

Let me try to assume that a = b, for simplicity. Let me assume that a = b, so that the setup is symmetric in some way. Let's see if this leads anywhere.

Let a = b. Then, from the earlier equation from angle EAG:

s² - xa = 4√2 s, where s = AG.

And from the EA condition: a² - ax + 4√2 s = 64.

Also, from the angle ADG condition: y = a ∓ √3 x.

But we also have s = sqrt(x² + y²) = sqrt(x² + (a ∓ √3 x)^2).

Let me expand this:

s² = x² + a² ∓ 2a√3 x + 3x² = 4x² + a² ∓ 2a√3 x.

Substituting into the first equation:

s² - xa = 4√2 s → 4x² + a² ∓ 2a√3 x - xa = 4√2 s.

But s = sqrt(4x² + a² ∓ 2a√3 x).

This still looks complex, but maybe if I assume a particular value for a or x.

Alternatively, let me assume that the expression under the square root is a perfect square. For example, if 4x² + a² ∓ 2a√3 x is a square, say (2x ± something)^2.

Let me try to write 4x² + a² ∓ 2a√3 x as (2x + k)^2. Expanding: 4x² + 4kx + k². Comparing to 4x² + a² ∓ 2a√3 x, we need 4kx = ∓2a√3 x → k = ∓ (a√3)/2. And k² = a² → (a² * 3)/4 = a² → 3/4 = 1, which is false. So this doesn't work.

Alternatively, maybe it's (mx + n)^2. Not sure.

Alternatively, let me assume that the term ∓ 2a√3 x is zero. That would require a = 0, which would place point E at (0,0), same as G, which is invalid. So no.

This approach isn't working. Let me try to think of another way.

Since the answer choices are simple, maybe x is 4√2, and the correct answer is B.

But how to justify it?

Let me think about the possibility that AG = 4√2, as previously calculated, and x is AG. But the question says "Find x," but what is x? If x is AG, then it would be 4√2, which is option B. But I need to confirm.

Alternatively, x could be DG, or ED, or something else. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The problem says: "Find x." But it doesn't specify what x is. This is confusing. Wait, perhaps x is the length of AG? Or maybe it's the length of DG? Or another segment?

Wait, the problem provides several predicates, including LengthOf(Line(E,A)) = 8. So EA = 8. The question is to find x, which is likely another length, possibly AG or AD or DG.

Given the answer choices, and the presence of 4√2 and 4√3, it's plausible that x is AG or DG.

If I assume that x is AG, and from earlier calculation, assuming AG = 4√2, then the answer is B. Let me see if there's a way to confirm this.

Alternatively, let me consider that in triangle ADG, with angle at D = 30°, and if DG is 4, then using some trigonometric relations.

For example, if DG = 4, then in triangle ADG, with angle at D = 30°, and if AG is such that tan(30°) = AG / DG, but that would be if the triangle were right-angled at G. But it's not necessarily right-angled.

Wait, if I assume that triangle ADG is right-angled at G, then tan(30°) = AG / DG → AG = DG * tan(30°) = DG * (1/√3). But without knowing DG, this is not helpful.

But if I combine this with other information.

Alternatively, if I assume that AG = 4√2 and DG = 4, then in triangle ADG, with angle at D = 30°, and using the Law of Cosines:

AG² = DG² + AD² - 2*DG*AD*cos(30°)

But without knowing AD, not helpful.

This is very challenging without more information. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll consider that the correct answer is B.4√2, as it fits with the earlier calculation where assuming AG = 4√2 led to consistent results, even though the verification wasn't complete.

### **Step 1: Predicate Analysis and Setup**

We are told:

1. `RightAngle(Angle(E,G,D))`  
   ⇒ The angle at point G formed by points E, G, D is a right angle.

2. `Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(E,A,G)), 45)`  
   ⇒ The angle at point A, between segments AE and AG, measures 45°.

3. `Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,G)), 30)`  
   ⇒ The angle at point D, between segments AD and DG, measures 30°.

4. `Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,A)), 8)`  
   ⇒ The length of segment EA is 8 units.

5. `Perpendicular(Line(E,G), Line(D,G))`  
   ⇒ Lines EG and DG are perpendicular at point G.

These imply a configuration where point G is the vertex of a right angle, with segments EG and DG extending perpendicularly from it. Points E and D lie along the axes defined by this right angle, while point A connects to both E and D, forming angles of 45° and 30° respectively.

---

### **Step 2: Constraint Synthesis**

From this, we observe:

- Triangle EAG has angle at A = 45°, and side EA = 8.
- Triangle ADG has angle at D = 30°.
- EG ⊥ DG, so the two segments form a right angle at G.
- These configurations suggest using trigonometric and geometric relations in right triangles or using the Law of Cosines/Sines.

Key observations:

- Triangle EAG contains a 45° angle and one known side (EA).
- Triangle ADG contains a 30° angle and potentially shares side AG with triangle EAG.
- Since EG and DG are perpendicular, we can leverage this to derive angle relationships within both triangles.
