<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points F, G, H, J, K, and a circle A. Some of these points lie on the circle, and there are lines connecting them. Also, there's a tangent line involved. The question gives us some lengths: FG is 18, GH is 42, and FK is 15. We need to find 'a', but wait, the answer choices don't mention 'a' directly. Wait, maybe 'a' refers to something else? Let me check again.

Wait, looking back at the given predicates, the first one is Circle(A). Oh, so maybe 'A' here is the center of the circle? Or perhaps 'a' is referring to a length or another point? Hmm. But the answer choices are numbers, so maybe 'a' stands for a certain length. Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, and they meant to refer to a specific segment. Wait, the original problem says "Find a, if..." Maybe 'a' is supposed to be the radius of the circle? Or maybe it's another segment?

Alternatively, maybe there was a misformatting. Let me re-express the problem. Given that Line(F,G) is tangent to Circle(A), and points G, H, J lie on the circle. Also, there's a line from F to K. The lengths given are FG=18, GH=42, FK=15. Need to find 'a'.

Wait, since there's a tangent line from F to the circle, touching at point G. Because the tangent line is Line(F,G). Since it's tangent to the circle at G, then FG would be the tangent segment from F to the circle. Then, according to the tangent-secant theorem, the square of the tangent segment equals the product of the whole secant segment and its external part. But wait, maybe there's another secant here. Let me think.

But where is point K? There's a line from F to K. So, if K is another point, maybe on the circle? Wait, the points on the circle are G, H, J. Are K and others on the circle? Let me check the predicates again. The given points on the circle are G, H, J. So K is not necessarily on the circle unless specified. So, Line(F,K) connects F to K, but K isn't mentioned as being on the circle. 

So, considering that FG is tangent to the circle at G, and maybe there's a secant line passing through F and intersecting the circle at two points. Wait, but the line from F to K—maybe that's a secant? But unless K is on the circle, which it's not stated. Wait, but maybe there's another intersection point. Let me think again.

Since Line(F,G) is tangent at G, and points H and J are also on the circle. Maybe there's another line from F that intersects the circle at other points. For example, if there's a line from F that passes through H or J. But the given lines are Line(F,G), Line(F,K), and Line(H,J). So Line(H,J) is a chord of the circle because H and J are on the circle. 

Now, given that FG is tangent, and GH is 42. So G is the point of tangency, and H is another point on the circle. So the distance from G to H along the circle is 42 units. But how does that relate to other segments? Also, FK is 15. So maybe there's a power of a point relationship here. 

Power of a Point theorem states that for a point outside a circle, the square of the tangent length equals the product of the lengths of the entire secant segment and its external part. In this case, point F is outside the circle, and FG is tangent to the circle. So Power of Point F with respect to circle A is FG² = (FK)(something). Wait, but what is the secant here? If there's a secant from F passing through the circle, say, intersecting at two points. Suppose the line FK intersects the circle at two points. However, we know that H and J are on the circle, but we don't know if K is on the circle. 

Wait, but if Line(F,K) intersects the circle, then maybe K is outside, and the line passes through the circle at two points. But without knowing where exactly, maybe we need more info. Wait, but GH is given as 42. Maybe there's a way to connect GH with other segments. 

Let me try to sketch this mentally. Point F is outside the circle, with tangent FG (so FG is tangent at G). Then, there's a line FH? Not sure. Wait, the line HJ is given, which is a chord of the circle. Points H and J are on the circle. Also, there's a line from F to K. 

But perhaps there's a triangle or some relation involving these points. Let me consider applying the Power of a Point theorem. Since FG is tangent, then FG² = (power of F). If there's a secant from F passing through the circle, say, intersecting at points X and Y, then FX * FY = FG². 

Suppose that line FK intersects the circle at two points. Let's assume that K is outside the circle, and the line FK passes through the circle at some points. But we don't know if K is inside or outside. However, since we have GH = 42, which is a chord of the circle. Maybe there's a way to use triangle relations. 

Alternatively, maybe the points are arranged such that F is connected to G (tangent), G to H (chord?), and H to J (another chord). But I'm getting confused. Let me focus on the Power of a Point. 

Given that FG is tangent, FG² should equal the power of F. Let's suppose there is a secant from F passing through the circle. Let's say the line FK intersects the circle at two points. Let me denote those points as, say, P and Q, with FP < FQ. Then, FP * FQ = FG². 

But we don't know where K is located. However, if we can express FK in terms of other segments. Wait, given that FK = 15, which is a segment from F to K. If K were one of the intersection points of the secant, then maybe FK is part of that secant. But without knowing whether K is inside or outside, it's tricky. 

Wait, but the problem gives GH = 42. Since G and H are points on the circle, GH is a chord of the circle. So GH is a chord of length 42. Now, if we can relate GH to other parts. 

Alternatively, maybe triangle FGH is involved. Let me think about triangle FGH. FG is 18, GH is 42, and maybe FH can be found via Pythagoras if there's a right angle. But why would there be a right angle? Well, since FG is tangent to the circle at G, and GH is a chord. The tangent at G is perpendicular to the radius AG. So AG is perpendicular to FG. Therefore, AG ⊥ FG. 

So, if we can find coordinates or use coordinate geometry. Let me try setting up coordinates. Let’s place point G at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since FG is tangent at G, and AG is perpendicular to FG. Let me assume that FG lies along the x-axis. So point F is somewhere along the x-axis. Let me define coordinates accordingly. 

Let’s set G at (0,0). Since FG is a tangent, and the radius AG is perpendicular to FG. Let me assume that the center A lies somewhere along the y-axis because AG is perpendicular to FG (which is horizontal). So, the center A has coordinates (0, b) for some b. 

Then, the radius AG is the distance from A to G, which is sqrt((0-0)^2 + (b-0)^2) = |b|. So the radius r = |b|. 

Now, point F is on the tangent line at G, so along the x-axis. Let me denote F as (f, 0), where f > 0 because it's outside the circle. The length FG is 18, so the distance between F(f,0) and G(0,0) is |f| = 18. Hence, f = 18 (assuming F is to the right of G). So F is at (18, 0).

Now, the line FG is along the x-axis from (18,0) to (0,0). The center A is at (0,b), and the radius is |b|. 

Now, point H is another point on the circle. Since GH is 42, which is the length from G(0,0) to H. But H is on the circle centered at (0,b) with radius |b|. Let me write the equation of the circle: x² + (y - b)^2 = b². Simplifying, x² + y² - 2by = 0. 

Point H lies on this circle, so coordinates of H satisfy x_H² + y_H² - 2b y_H = 0. Also, the distance from G(0,0) to H(x_H, y_H) is √[(x_H)^2 + (y_H)^2] = 42. Squaring both sides: x_H² + y_H² = 42² = 1764. 

From the circle equation, x_H² + y_H² - 2b y_H = 0 => 1764 - 2b y_H = 0 → 2b y_H = 1764 → y_H = 1764/(2b) = 882/b. 

So the y-coordinate of H is 882/b. 

Also, since H lies on the circle, we can plug into the circle equation:

x_H² + (y_H)^2 = 1764. But also, from the circle equation, x_H² + y_H^2 - 2b y_H = 0 ⇒ x_H² + y_H^2 = 2b y_H. Which equals 2b*(882/b) = 1764. That checks out. 

So, we have H's coordinates as (x_H, 882/b). Now, we also have the line HJ, which is a chord of the circle. But we don't have information about J yet. However, we also have point K, connected by line FK. The length FK is given as 15. 

Let me see. Point K is connected to F(18,0) with a line of length 15. So the coordinates of K must satisfy the distance from F(18,0) to K(x_K, y_K) is 15. So:

√[(x_K - 18)^2 + (y_K)^2] = 15 ⇒ (x_K - 18)^2 + y_K^2 = 225. 

Additionally, since there's a line from F to K, but unless K is on the circle, we don't know much. However, maybe K is the second intersection point of some secant with the circle? 

Wait, earlier, we had the Power of a Point theorem. The power of point F with respect to circle A is FG² = 18² = 324. This should also equal FK * FK', where FK' is the entire length of the secant from F through K to the second intersection point. But if K is outside the circle, then FK would be the external segment, and the total secant length would be FK * (FK + KP), where P is the second intersection. But without knowing where K is, this seems challenging. 

Alternatively, if the line FK intersects the circle at two points, say, K and another point, then Power of a Point would give FK * FK_total = FG². But since we don't know the position of K, maybe there's another way. 

Wait, but we also have GH = 42. Earlier, we found that the y-coordinate of H is 882/b. Also, since H is on the circle, we can compute the coordinates of H in terms of b. But without more information, it's hard to proceed. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a relation between GH and other segments. Let me recall that in the circle, the distance between G and H is a chord of length 42. The formula for the length of a chord is 2r sin(theta/2), where theta is the central angle subtended by the chord. But we might not know theta. 

Alternatively, since we have the coordinates of G(0,0) and H(x_H, y_H), the distance between them is 42. From earlier, x_H² + y_H² = 1764. Also, since H is on the circle, x_H² + (y_H - b)^2 = b². Expanding that: x_H² + y_H² - 2b y_H + b² = b² ⇒ x_H² + y_H² - 2b y_H = 0. Which we already used. 

So combining with x_H² + y_H² = 1764, we get 1764 - 2b y_H = 0 ⇒ y_H = 882 / b. 

Now, maybe we can find another equation involving b. Let's think. What else do we know? 

We also have the line HJ, which is a chord of the circle. But we don't have info about J. However, since J is also on the circle, maybe there's another relation. But without more data, this might not help. 

Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that line FK is given as 15. Let me consider the coordinates of K. Since K lies somewhere such that distance from F(18,0) to K is 15. Also, maybe K lies on some line related to the circle. 

But unless K is on the circle, which we don't know. If K were on the circle, then the power of point F would be FK² = FG². But FK is 15, and FG is 18. Then 15² ≠ 18², so that can't be. Therefore, K is not on the circle. 

Therefore, the line FK is a secant that doesn't pass through the circle, or maybe it's a tangent? But no, because it's not specified. 

Wait, but if the line FK intersects the circle at two points, then the power of point F would be FK * FK' = FG². But since we don't know where K is, this might not help directly. 

Wait, but maybe there's another way. Let's go back to the Power of a Point. The power of point F is FG² = 324. Also, if there's a secant from F passing through the circle, say, intersecting at points M and N, then FM * FN = 324. 

Assuming that line FK passes through the circle, then if K is the second intersection point, then FM would be the distance from F to the first intersection, and FN would be from F to the second. But since we don't know where K is, this seems unclear. 

Wait, but maybe the line FK passes through point H? Because we have GH = 42. Wait, GH is from G to H, which is a chord. Is there a connection between FK and GH? 

Alternatively, maybe triangle FGH is formed, with FG=18, GH=42, and FH as a side. If we can find FH, then maybe use the Law of Cosines or something. But we need an angle. 

But since FG is tangent to the circle at G, and GH is a chord. The angle between FG and GH could be related to the angle subtended by the chord GH. 

Wait, the tangent FG makes an angle with the chord GH. The angle between tangent FG and chord GH is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. That's the Alternate Segment Theorem. 

So, the angle between FG and GH is equal to the angle that GH makes with the chord in the alternate segment. But I'm not sure how to apply this here. 

Alternatively, since AG is perpendicular to FG, and AG is the radius, we can consider triangle AGH. Let me think. 

AG is perpendicular to FG. So, in triangle AGF, we have AG perpendicular to FG. Also, GH is a chord of the circle, so AH is another radius. 

Wait, maybe using coordinates again. Let me continue with the coordinate system. 

Earlier, we had center A at (0, b), radius r = |b|. 

Coordinates of G: (0, 0)

Coordinates of F: (18, 0)

Coordinates of H: (x_H, y_H), with x_H² + y_H² = 1764 and y_H = 882/b.

Now, let's find coordinates of H. Also, since H is on the circle, it satisfies x_H² + (y_H - b)^2 = b². 

Expanding that: x_H² + y_H² - 2b y_H + b² = b² ⇒ x_H² + y_H² - 2b y_H = 0. Which we already used. 

We can also calculate the vector from G to H: from (0,0) to (x_H, y_H), so vector (x_H, y_H). The direction of this vector is important. 

But how does this help us? Maybe we can find the slope of GH, and then relate it to the slope of FG. Since FG is along the x-axis, its slope is 0. The slope of GH would be y_H / x_H. 

According to the Alternate Segment Theorem, the angle between FG (slope 0) and GH (slope m) should be equal to the angle subtended by GH in the alternate segment. 

But I'm not sure how to quantify this. Alternatively, since AG is perpendicular to FG, AG is vertical (since FG is horizontal). So AG is along the y-axis. The angle between AG and GH would be related to the angle between the radius and the chord GH. 

In general, the angle between the tangent and the chord is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. So, angle between FG (tangent) and GH (chord) is equal to the angle that GH makes with the arc opposite. 

But maybe instead of going into angles, I can use vectors or slopes. 

The slope of GH is (y_H - 0)/(x_H - 0) = y_H/x_H. 

The slope of AG is undefined (vertical line), since A is at (0,b) and G is at (0,0). So AG is straight up the y-axis. 

So, the angle between GH and AG can be found using the dot product. The vector GH is (x_H, y_H), and the vector AG is (0, b) - (0,0) = (0, b). Wait, AG is from G to A: from (0,0) to (0,b), so vector (0, b). 

The angle between vector GH (x_H, y_H) and vector AG (0, b) is θ. 

Using the dot product: cosθ = (x_H*0 + y_H*b) / (|GH| * |AG|) ) = (y_H * b) / (42 * |AG|). 

But |AG| is the radius, which is |b|. So cosθ = (y_H * b)/ (42 * |b|) ) = y_H / 42. 

But from earlier, y_H = 882 / b. So substituting, cosθ = (882 / b) / 42 = 882 / (42b) = 21 / b. 

Hmm, interesting. So cosθ = 21 / b. 

But what is θ? It's the angle between GH and AG. But AG is the radius, and GH is a chord. 

Alternatively, since AG is perpendicular to FG, and we're dealing with angles here, maybe there's another relation. 

But I'm not sure how to proceed further with this. Let me think if there's another approach. 

We also know that FK = 15. Let's consider the coordinates of K. Since F is at (18,0), and K is some point such that distance from F to K is 15. So K lies on a circle of radius 15 around F. 

But unless we know more about K, like if it's on the main circle or something else, it's hard to say. 

Wait, but maybe there's a relation between K and H. Like, maybe line FK passes through H? If that's the case, then we could find coordinates of K such that it lies on line FH. 

Wait, let's explore that possibility. Assume that line FK passes through H. So points F, K, and H are colinear. Then, the distance from F to K is 15, and the distance from F to H can be computed. 

If we can find FH, then since FK is 15, and assuming K is between F and H, or vice versa. 

Let me calculate FH. Coordinates of F(18,0) and H(x_H, y_H). So the distance FH is sqrt[(x_H - 18)^2 + (y_H)^2]. 

But we know x_H² + y_H² = 1764. So expanding [(x_H - 18)^2 + y_H^2] = x_H² - 36x_H + 324 + y_H^2 = (x_H² + y_H^2) - 36x_H + 324 = 1764 - 36x_H + 324 = 2088 - 36x_H. 

So FH = sqrt(2088 - 36x_H). 

But we don't know x_H. However, we can relate x_H to b. 

From earlier, we have x_H² + y_H² = 1764, and y_H = 882 / b. Also, from the circle equation, x_H² + (y_H)^2 - 2b y_H = 0 → 1764 - 2b y_H = 0 → y_H = 882 / b. 

So we can write x_H² = 1764 - y_H^2 = 1764 - (882/b)^2. 

Thus, x_H = ±sqrt[1764 - (882^2)/(b^2)]. 

This seems complicated. Maybe there's another way. 

Alternatively, since we have FH expressed in terms of x_H, and if we assume that K is on line FH, then we can express K's coordinates as a point along FH at distance 15 from F. 

Let me parametrize line FH. Let’s say vector from F to H is (x_H - 18, y_H - 0) = (x_H - 18, y_H). 

Parametric equations for line FH: starting at F(18,0), moving towards H(x_H, y_H). So any point K on this line can be written as F + t*(vector FH), where t is a scalar. 

So coordinates of K are (18 + t(x_H - 18), 0 + t(y_H)). 

The distance from F to K is 15, so:

sqrt[(t(x_H - 18))^2 + (t y_H)^2] = 15 

=> t * sqrt[(x_H - 18)^2 + y_H^2] = 15 

But sqrt[(x_H - 18)^2 + y_H^2] is FH, which we denoted earlier as sqrt(2088 - 36x_H). 

So t = 15 / FH. 

But unless we know FH, this might not help. 

However, if we can find FH in terms of b, we might be able to proceed. 

From earlier, FH squared is 2088 - 36x_H. 

But x_H is sqrt(1764 - (882/b)^2), but this seems too tangled. 

Wait, but maybe there's another relation. Remember that point H is on the circle, so it satisfies the circle equation. 

The circle's equation is x² + (y - b)^2 = b². Substituting H(x_H, y_H):

x_H² + (y_H - b)^2 = b² 

Expanding: x_H² + y_H² - 2b y_H + b² = b² 

Which simplifies to x_H² + y_H² - 2b y_H = 0 

But we already knew that from before. And since x_H² + y_H² = 1764, this becomes 1764 - 2b y_H = 0 → y_H = 882 / b. 

So, we can substitute y_H into this. 

Now, if we can find x_H, we might relate it to other variables. 

But how? Let me think. 

We also know that point H lies on the circle, so we can use the coordinates of H to find relations. 

But without more information about the location of H, it's difficult. Perhaps we need to involve the line HJ. 

Wait, the line HJ is given, which is a chord of the circle. But we don't have information about J. Unless there's a property about HJ being related to other elements. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to use the Power of Point F with respect to the circle. 

We know that the power of F is FG² = 324. 

If there is a secant from F passing through the circle, say, intersecting at points M and N, then FM * FN = 324. 

Assume that line FK intersects the circle at two points. Let's say the line FK intersects the circle at point M and N, with FM = a and FN = a + b, but without knowing the order. 

But since we know FK = 15, which could be FM or FN depending on where K is. 

But without knowing where K is, this is still vague. 

Wait, but maybe there's another secant. For example, if line FH intersects the circle at G and H. Wait, but G is already on the circle. So if line FG is tangent at G, and line FH passes through G and H, then the secant would be from F through G to H. 

Wait, but line FG is tangent at G, so it touches the circle only at G. If line FH passes through G and H, then it would intersect the circle at G and H. Thus, the power of point F with respect to the circle would be FG² = FG * FH. 

Wait, yes! Because if a secant from F passes through G and H, then the power of F is FG * FH. But FG is the tangent, so FG² = FG * FH. 

Ah! This is crucial. 

So, if line FH passes through G and H, then the power of point F is FG² = FG * FH. 

But wait, FG is the tangent segment, and FH is the entire secant segment from F to H, passing through G. 

But wait, the secant goes from F, through G, to H. So the two intersection points are G and H. So the power of point F would be FG * FH, where FG is the length from F to G, and FH is the length from F to H. But actually, the formula is: if a secant from F passes through the circle at two points, say, M and N, then FM * FN = power of F. Here, the two points are G and H. So the power of F is FG * FH. 

Wait, but FG is the length from F to G, and FH is the length from F to H. But since G is between F and H, the power of F is FG * FH. Wait, no, the formula is FM * FN, where FM is the distance from F to the first intersection point, and FN is the distance from F to the second intersection point. 

In this case, if the secant passes through G and H, with G closer to F than H, then FM = FG, and FN = FH. So FG * FH = power of F = FG². 

So, FG * FH = FG² → FH = FG. 

Wait, that would imply FH = FG, which is 18. But FH is the distance from F to H, which is sqrt[(x_H - 18)^2 + y_H^2], which we previously said equals sqrt(2088 - 36x_H). Setting this equal to 18 gives:

sqrt(2088 - 36x_H) = 18 → 2088 - 36x_H = 324 → 36x_H = 2088 - 324 = 1764 → x_H = 1764 / 36 = 49. 

So x_H = 49. 

Then, from earlier, we have x_H² + y_H² = 1764. Plugging x_H = 49:

49² + y_H² = 1764 → 2401 + y_H² = 1764 → y_H² = 1764 - 2401 = -637. 

Wait, that's impossible! y_H squared cannot be negative. So this leads to a contradiction. 

What did I do wrong here? 

Oh, because the assumption that the secant passes through G and H might be incorrect. Because if the line FH passes through G and H, then G is between F and H. But earlier, we have FG as a tangent at G, implying that G is the only intersection point of line FG with the circle. But if line FH passes through G and H, then line FH would intersect the circle at G and H, making it a secant. However, this would mean that line FG is part of line FH, but since FG is tangent at G, it can't pass through another point H on the circle. Wait, that contradicts. 

Because if line FH passes through G and H, then line FG is part of line FH, which would mean that line FG is a secant passing through G and H, but since it's tangent at G, it can't pass through another point H on the circle. Therefore, my previous assumption is invalid. 

So, that approach led to a contradiction. Where is the mistake? 

Ah, right! The line FG is tangent at G, so it touches the circle only at G. If line FH passes through G and H, then line FG is the same as line FH, implying that H is also on the tangent line, but since H is on the circle, this would require that the tangent line FG also passes through H, which is only possible if H=G, which it isn't. Hence, the error. 

So, my previous assumption was wrong. Therefore, the line FH is not the same as FG. So, the secant from F that passes through the circle is not FH. 

So, back to the drawing board. 

Maybe there's another secant from F. Let's think. If line FK intersects the circle at two points, say, M and N, then power of point F is FM * FN = FG² = 324. 

But we don't know where K is, but we know FK = 15. Assuming that K is one of the intersection points, say, M. Then, FM = FK = 15, and FN = FM + MN, but without knowing the position, it's hard. 

Alternatively, if K is outside the circle, then the secant would extend beyond K, but without more info, it's hard. 

Wait, but what if the line FK intersects the circle at one point, K, making it a tangent? But it's not stated that FK is tangent. 

Alternatively, maybe K is the midpoint of a secant. 

But this seems too vague. Let me think differently. 

We know that GH = 42, and we've tried relating it to other segments. Earlier, we had y_H = 882 / b, and x_H² + y_H² = 1764. So x_H² = 1764 - y_H² = 1764 - (882/b)^2. 

Also, we can find the coordinates of H as (x_H, 882/b). 

Now, let's consider the line from F(18,0) to K, with FK = 15. Let's assume that K is somewhere such that line FK intersects the circle at another point. Let's call this intersection point P. Then, by power of a point, FK * FP = FG² = 324. 

If K is outside the circle, then FP is the length from F to the second intersection point P. So, if FK is the distance from F to K, and K is outside, then FP = FK + KP, but without knowing KP, it's not helpful. 

Alternatively, if K is inside the circle, then FP = FK - KP, but again, not helpful. 

But maybe K is one of the intersection points. Let's say that line FK intersects the circle at K and another point, say, P. Then, FK * FP = 324. If K is outside, then FK is the length from F to K, and FP is the full secant length. But if K is the farther point, then FK = FP, and the other intersection is at zero, which doesn't make sense. 

Wait, this is getting too abstract. Let me try plugging in the values. 

Let me assume that the line FK passes through the circle, and K is outside. So, let's denote the two intersection points as P and Q, with F outside, and the secant passing through P and Q. Let's say that FK is the segment from F to K, where K is the point farther from F, so that FK = FP, and the other intersection is at a distance of FP - PK. 

But without knowing where K is, this is still unclear. 

Wait, but we have GH = 42. Maybe there's a way to connect this with the Power of a Point. 

Let me revisit the earlier calculation where I assumed that line FH passes through G and H, leading to a contradiction. Perhaps there's a different configuration. 

Let me try again. Suppose that line FH passes through the circle at G and another point. Wait, but FG is tangent at G, so if line FH passes through G, then it would be the same as line FG, which implies H is on line FG. But GH would then be a segment on the tangent line. 

But GH is given as 42. So, if H is on line FG, then GH is along the tangent line. 

Let me explore this scenario. 

If H is on line FG, then since G is on the circle and H is also on the circle, and FG is tangent at G, then H would have to be G itself, which it isn't. Hence, this is impossible. 

So, H cannot be on line FG. 

Another idea: maybe the line HK is a tangent? No, it's not stated. 

Wait, but the problem mentions points G, H, J on the circle, and line HJ. So, HJ is a chord of the circle. 

Maybe triangle FGH has some relation. Let me try to calculate the coordinates of H again. 

We have x_H² + y_H² = 1764, and y_H = 882/b. 

Also, since H is on the circle, x_H² + (y_H - b)^2 = b². 

Subtracting the two equations:

[x_H² + (y_H - b)^2] - [x_H² + y_H^2] = b² - 1764 

Expand: (y_H^2 - 2b y_H + b^2) - y_H^2 = b² - 1764 

Simplify: -2b y_H + b^2 = b² - 1764 

Cancel b²: -2b y_H = -1764 → 2b y_H = 1764 → y_H = 882/b, which matches our earlier result. 

No new information here. 

Perhaps we need to relate this to the line FK = 15. Let's assume that K is a point such that line FK passes through H. So, line FK passes through H, and FK = 15. 

If that's the case, then the distance from F to K is 15, and H lies on line FK. 

So, let's assume that H is between F and K, or K is between F and H. 

Case 1: H is between F and K. Then, FH + HK = FK = 15. 

Case 2: K is between F and H. Then, FK + KH = FH. 

But we know FH is the distance from F to H, which we previously tried to calculate. 

Let me calculate FH in terms of b. 

FH^2 = (x_H - 18)^2 + y_H^2 = x_H^2 - 36x_H + 324 + y_H^2 = (x_H^2 + y_H^2) - 36x_H + 324 = 1764 - 36x_H + 324 = 2088 - 36x_H. 

But x_H = sqrt(1764 - y_H^2). Wait, but we also have y_H = 882/b. 

So, x_H = sqrt(1764 - (882/b)^2). 

This seems complicated, but let's proceed. 

If we assume that H is on line FK, then FH + HK = FK = 15. 

But we don't know where H is. Alternatively, if K is between F and H, then FK + KH = FH. 

But without knowing the position, it's hard to proceed. 

Let me try Case 2: K is between F and H. So, FK + KH = FH. 

But FK = 15, so 15 + KH = FH → KH = FH - 15. 

But we also know that H is on the circle, and K is a point on line FH. 

But how does this help? 

Alternatively, since K is on line FH, and we know the coordinates of F and H, we can parameterize K. 

Let me define parameter t such that K divides FH in some ratio. 

Let me denote vector from F to H as (x_H - 18, y_H). Let me write parametrically:

K = F + t*(vector FH), where t is a scalar. 

So, coordinates of K are (18 + t(x_H - 18), 0 + t*y_H). 

Distance from F to K is 15:

sqrt[(t(x_H - 18))^2 + (t y_H)^2] = 15 

→ t * sqrt[(x_H - 18)^2 + y_H^2] = 15 

→ t = 15 / FH 

But FH is sqrt(2088 - 36x_H), as before. 

But without knowing x_H, this is still stuck. 

However, we also know that point K is on line FH, and possibly on the circle? No, because if it were on the circle, then FK would be a tangent, but it's not stated. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another condition. 

Wait, but we also know that GH = 42. And GH is the distance from G(0,0) to H(x_H, y_H), which is 42. 

We already used that to derive x_H^2 + y_H^2 = 1764. 

So, combining this with the expression for x_H in terms of b: 

x_H = sqrt(1764 - y_H^2) = sqrt(1764 - (882/b)^2). 

Let me denote this as x_H = sqrt(1764 - (882^2)/b^2). 

Now, let's go back to the expression for t: t = 15 / FH, where FH = sqrt(2088 - 36x_H). 

But FH = sqrt(2088 - 36x_H). Let's substitute x_H:

FH = sqrt(2088 - 36 * sqrt(1764 - (882^2)/b^2)). 

This is very complex. Maybe there's a better approach. 

Let me think about the Power of a Point again. If there is a secant from F passing through the circle at two points, say, P and Q, then FP * FQ = 324. 

If we can find one of these points, perhaps H or K? 

But we know that GH = 42, and G is on the circle. If line FG is tangent at G, and if there's another point on line FG, but it's already tangent, so no other intersection. 

Alternatively, if line FH intersects the circle at G and H, but we saw that leads to contradiction. 

Wait, but what if line FH intersects the circle at G and another point, say, P? But since FG is tangent at G, it can't pass through another point on the circle. Hence, line FH can't pass through G. 

So, line FH must intersect the circle at two points other than G. 

But we know that H is on the circle. So, if line FH intersects the circle at H and another point, say, P. Then, the power of point F would be FP * FH = 324. 

But we don't know where P is. 

However, we know that GH = 42. Maybe there's a relation between GH and FP. 

But I'm stuck. 

Let me try to think numerically. Let's assume that the answer is one of the options: 15, 18, 42, 57. 

Wait, the question asks to find 'a'. But what is 'a'? The problem statement says "Find a, if F G = 18, G H = 42, and F K = 15." 

Wait, perhaps 'a' is the radius of the circle? Or maybe it's the length of FH? Or something else. 

Looking back at the given predicates, the only circle mentioned is Circle(A), and the points on it are G, H, J. So, if 'a' is the radius, then we need to find the radius. 

Alternatively, maybe 'a' is the length of FK, but FK is given as 15, so that can't be. 

Wait, the answer choices are A. 15, B. 18, C. 42, D. 57. 

Given that FG is 18, GH is 42, FK is 15. The options include 15, 18, 42, 57. 

If 'a' is the length of FH, then maybe we can find it. 

Earlier, we had FH^2 = 2088 - 36x_H. But x_H = sqrt(1764 - (882/b)^2). 

But without knowing b, this is not helpful. 

Wait, let me try to relate this to the Power of a Point. If there is a secant from F passing through the circle at two points, say, P and Q, then FP * FQ = 324. 

If we can find one of these points, like H or K, then we can solve for the other. 

Assume that line FK passes through the circle at K and another point, say, P. Then, FK * FP = 324. 

But we know FK = 15, so 15 * FP = 324 → FP = 324 / 15 = 21.6. 

But this assumes that K is the farther point, so FP = FK + KP, but without knowing KP, it's not helpful. 

Alternatively, if K is between F and P, then FP = FK - KP. 

But this is still too vague. 

Wait, but if we assume that line FK passes through the circle at one point, K, making it a tangent, then FK would be the tangent, but it's not stated. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup, and 'a' is the length of FH, which is 57? Let me check. 

If FH = 57, then from earlier, FH^2 = 2088 - 36x_H = 57^2 = 3249. 

So, 2088 - 36x_H = 3249 → -36x_H = 3249 - 2088 = 1161 → x_H = -1161 / 36 = -32.25. 

Then, x_H = -32.25. 

Then, x_H^2 = (32.25)^2 = 104
