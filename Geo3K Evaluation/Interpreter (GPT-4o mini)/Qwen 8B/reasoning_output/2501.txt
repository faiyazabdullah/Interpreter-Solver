MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have triangle PQR, and points S and T such that ST is parallel to RQ. We're given PS = 12.5, SR = 5, and PT = 15. Need to find TQ. Let me try to visualize this first.

First, I should probably draw a diagram. Since it's a triangle PQR, let me imagine points P, Q, R forming a triangle. Now, there are points S and T. The predicates say that S lies on line PR because PointLiesOnLine(S, Line(P,R)), and T lies on line PQ since PointLiesOnLine(T, Line(P,Q)). Also, ST is parallel to RQ. 

So, S is somewhere on PR, T is on PQ, and the segment ST is parallel to RQ. That seems like a case where similar triangles might come into play. Because if two lines are parallel, maybe there's some proportionality involved.

Let me recall the Basic Proportionality Theorem, also known as Thales' theorem. It states that if a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle intersecting the other two sides, then it divides those sides proportionally. Wait, but here ST is parallel to RQ. But where exactly? Let me think.

Since ST || RQ, and S is on PR, T is on PQ. So, maybe triangle PST is similar to triangle PQR? Wait, no. Because ST is parallel to RQ, so maybe triangle PST is similar to triangle PQR? Or perhaps triangle PQT?

Wait, let me clarify. Let's consider the transversal lines. Since ST is parallel to RQ, which connects R to Q. Let me see. Points S is on PR, T is on PQ. So, connecting S and T gives a line segment ST parallel to RQ. Therefore, according to the converse of Thales' theorem, if a line divides two sides of a triangle proportionally, then it is parallel to the third side. But here, the line ST is parallel to RQ, so the ratio of the segments on the two sides should be equal.

But wait, in this case, the line ST intersects PR at S and PQ at T. Wait, but RQ is another side. Maybe I need to set up proportions based on the segments created by ST.

Alternatively, since ST is parallel to RQ, then triangles PST and PQR might be similar? Wait, but RQ is the base of triangle PQR. Let me check the similarity.

If ST || RQ, then the corresponding angles would be equal. For example, angle at P is common to both triangles PST and PQR. And since ST || RQ, the corresponding angles would make the triangles similar. So, triangle PST ~ triangle PQR by AA similarity.

Wait, but let me confirm. In triangle PQR, if we have a line ST parallel to RQ, then yes, the angles at P would be common, and the other angles would correspond. So, triangle PST is similar to triangle PQR. Therefore, the ratio of their corresponding sides should be equal.

So, the ratio of PS to PR should be equal to PT to PQ, and also equal to ST over RQ.

But we know PS = 12.5 and SR = 5. Since S is on PR, then PR = PS + SR = 12.5 + 5 = 17.5. So, PR is 17.5 units long.

Now, if triangle PST ~ triangle PQR, then PS / PR = PT / PQ. Let me denote PT as 15, which is given. Let me write down the equation:

PS / PR = PT / PQ  
Which translates to 12.5 / 17.5 = 15 / PQ

Cross-multiplying, we get 12.5 * PQ = 15 * 17.5  
So, PQ = (15 * 17.5) / 12.5  

Calculating that: 15 divided by 12.5 is 1.2, multiplied by 17.5. Let me compute 1.2 * 17.5. Well, 17.5 * 1 = 17.5, 17.5 * 0.2 = 3.5, so total is 17.5 + 3.5 = 21. So, PQ = 21.

But wait, the question asks for TQ. Since T is on PQ, and PT = 15, then TQ = PQ - PT = 21 - 15 = 6. So, the answer would be 6, which is option B.

Wait, but let me double-check my assumption about the similarity. Is triangle PST similar to triangle PQR? Because ST is parallel to RQ. So, angle at P is common. Then, angle PST equals angle PQR because they are corresponding angles due to ST || RQ. Similarly, angle PTS equals angle PRQ. Therefore, yes, the similarity holds. Thus, the ratio of PS to PR equals PT to PQ. Hence, the calculation above should be correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the concept of ratios along the sides. Since ST is parallel to RQ, the ratio of PS to SR would be equal to PT to TQ? Wait, that might not be directly applicable. Wait, let me think again.

Another way: Using the concept of intercept theorem (Thales' theorem). Since ST || RQ, the ratio of PS to SR equals the ratio of PT to TQ. Wait, but how does that work?

Wait, the intercept theorem says that if a line parallel to one side of a triangle intersects the other two sides, then it divides them proportionally. However, in this case, the line ST is cutting the sides PR and PQ. Wait, but RQ is not a side of triangle PRQ? Wait, original triangle is PQR, so sides are PQ, QR, RP. So, ST is parallel to RQ. So, ST is cutting PR and PQ. Therefore, applying the intercept theorem, the ratio of PS/SR = PT/TQ.

Wait, that seems different from before. Which one is correct?

Hold on, this is conflicting with the earlier conclusion. Let me clarify.

If line ST is parallel to RQ, then in triangle PRQ? Wait, RQ is a side of triangle PQR. So, if we consider triangle PRQ, and line ST parallel to RQ, cutting PR at S and PQ at T. Then, the intercept theorem applies here. So, the ratio PS/SR = PT/TQ.

But earlier, I considered similarity between PST and PQR. Which one is correct?

Wait, maybe I confused the triangle. Let me re-examine.

Original triangle is PQR. The line ST is parallel to RQ. So, considering triangle PRQ. Wait, but PR is a side, RQ is another side. So, if ST is parallel to RQ and cuts PR at S and PQ at T. Then, the intercept theorem applies to triangle PRQ, with ST being the line parallel to RQ. So, in that case, the ratio PS / SR = PT / TQ.

Therefore, PS / SR = PT / TQ.

Given that PS = 12.5, SR = 5, PT = 15. Plugging in:

12.5 / 5 = 15 / TQ  
Which simplifies to 2.5 = 15 / TQ  
Thus, TQ = 15 / 2.5 = 6. So, TQ = 6, which is option B.

This conflicts with my previous thought where I used similarity. So why was there a discrepancy?

Earlier, I assumed similarity between PST and PQR, leading to PS/PR = PT/PQ. But according to intercept theorem, it's PS/SR = PT/TQ. Which one is correct?

Wait, let's check with coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to verify.

Suppose point P is at (0,0). Let me assume coordinates for simplicity. Let me take PR as x-axis. Let me set P at (0,0), R at (17.5, 0) since PR is 17.5. Then, point S is located at PS = 12.5, so S is at (12.5, 0).

Now, since ST is parallel to RQ. Let me define point Q. Let me suppose Q has coordinates (a,b). Then, RQ goes from R(17.5, 0) to Q(a,b). The line ST needs to be parallel to RQ. Point T is on PQ. Let me parametrize.

Point T is on PQ. Let me express PQ. Since P is (0,0) and Q is (a,b), parametric equations for PQ can be written as t*(a,b), where t ranges from 0 to 1. Let me denote T as (ta, tb) for some t.

Similarly, point S is (12.5, 0). The line ST connects S(12.5, 0) to T(ta, tb). This line must be parallel to RQ, which has direction vector (a - 17.5, b - 0) = (a - 17.5, b).

The direction vector of ST is (ta - 12.5, tb - 0) = (ta - 12.5, tb).

For these vectors to be parallel, their components must be proportional. So,

(tb) / (ta - 12.5) = b / (a - 17.5)

Assuming b ≠ 0 and a ≠ 17.5, which they aren't since otherwise RQ would be vertical or undefined.

Canceling b from both sides:

tb / (ta - 12.5) = b / (a - 17.5)

Wait, actually, the slope of ST should equal the slope of RQ. Slope of RQ is (b - 0)/(a - 17.5) = b/(a - 17.5). Slope of ST is (tb - 0)/(ta - 12.5) = tb/(ta - 12.5). Setting equal:

tb/(ta - 12.5) = b/(a - 17.5)

Cancel b from both sides:

t/(ta - 12.5) = 1/(a - 17.5)

Cross multiplying:

t(a - 17.5) = ta - 12.5

Expanding left side: ta - 17.5t = ta - 12.5

Subtract ta from both sides:

-17.5t = -12.5

Divide both sides by -17.5:

t = (-12.5)/(-17.5) = 12.5/17.5 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714...

So, t = 5/7. Therefore, point T is at (ta, tb) = ( (5/7)a, (5/7)b )

Now, PT is the length from P(0,0) to T( (5/7)a, (5/7)b ). The length PT is sqrt[ ((5a/7)^2 + (5b/7)^2 ) ] = (5/7)sqrt(a² + b²). But we are told PT = 15. So:

(5/7)*sqrt(a² + b²) = 15 → sqrt(a² + b²) = 15*(7/5) = 21. So PQ, which is the distance from P(0,0) to Q(a,b) is 21. Therefore, PQ = 21. Therefore, TQ is PQ - PT = 21 - 15 = 6. So TQ = 6. Hence, the answer is B.

So this confirms the earlier result using intercept theorem. Therefore, the correct approach was using the intercept theorem (Thales' theorem), giving TQ = 6. The initial mistake in thinking about similarity was incorrect because the similar triangles would involve different sides. But the intercept theorem directly gives the ratio PS/SR = PT/TQ, leading to the answer.

Therefore, the correct answer is B.
