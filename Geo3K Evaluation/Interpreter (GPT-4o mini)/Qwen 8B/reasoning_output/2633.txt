MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points F, G, H, J, A, B. There's a circle with center A, since it's mentioned that Line(A,G) and Line(A,H) are radii. Also, Line(F,J) is the diameter of the circle. That means F and J are endpoints of the diameter. 

First, I need to visualize this. Let me sketch mentally. The circle has center A. Points G and H are on the circle because AG and AH are radii. Then, there's a line FJ which is the diameter, so F and J are on the circle too? Wait, if FJ is the diameter, then F and J are points on the circle such that A is the midpoint of FJ. But wait, the circle's center is A. So, if FJ is the diameter, then A should be the midpoint of FJ. Therefore, AF = AJ, each being a radius. Wait, but AG and AH are also radii. So, maybe points G and H are other points on the circle?

Also, there are lines: FG, FH, GH, FJ, HJ. So, connecting these points. The right angle at Angle(F,H,B). Hmm, point B is involved here. Not sure where B is yet. 

Wait, the problem mentions angles 2 and 3, with m∠2 = 2x and m∠3 = x. Need to find m∠3. Maybe angles 2 and 3 refer to some angles formed by intersecting lines or within the diagram. Since there's a right angle at Angle(F,H,B), which suggests that ∠FHB is a right angle. 

Let me start breaking down the given information step by step.

First, Circle(A): Center at A. Lines AG and AH are radii, so G and H lie on the circle. Line FJ is the diameter, so F and J are endpoints of the diameter, hence they're also on the circle. Therefore, points F, G, H, J are all on the circle centered at A. 

Now, looking at the lines: Line(F,G), Line(F,H), Line(G,H), Line(F,J), Line(H,J). So, F connected to G and H; G connected to H; F connected to J; H connected to J. 

So, perhaps triangle FGH? Or maybe triangle FHJ? Also, there's a right angle at Angle(F,H,B). So, point B is somewhere such that when you connect H to B, forming angle at H between F and B. 

But how does B fit into the diagram? Maybe B is another intersection point or constructed via some construction. Let me think. 

Since there's a right angle at ∠FHB, that implies that HF is perpendicular to HB. So, lines HF and HB form a right angle at H. Given that HF is part of the line FH, which connects F to H. So, if we extend HB such that it forms a right angle with HF, then B lies somewhere along that direction. 

Now, considering the circle. Since F and J are endpoints of the diameter, then any angle subtended by FJ would be a right angle if the point is on the circle. Wait, Thales' theorem states that an angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle. So, if B is on the circle, then ∠FBJ would be a right angle. But in our case, the right angle is at H. Wait, maybe B is not on the circle? Or maybe there's another relation.

Alternatively, since H is on the circle, and if we consider triangle FHB, with ∠H being a right angle. So, if HF is one leg, HB is another leg, and FB is hypotenuse. But since H is on the circle, and F is also on the circle. Wait, but HF is a chord of the circle. If ∠FHB is a right angle, then BH must be tangent to the circle at H? Because the tangent at H would be perpendicular to the radius AH. But AH is a radius, so if BH is tangent, then AH ⊥ BH. However, in our case, ∠FHB is a right angle, which would mean that HF ⊥ HB. So unless HF is aligned with the radius AH, but not necessarily. 

Wait, let's see. Let me think again. Since H is on the circle with center A, so AH is a radius. Now, if there's a right angle at H between F and B, then HF is one side, HB is another. For HF to be perpendicular to HB, then HB must be tangent to the circle at H. Because the tangent at H is perpendicular to the radius AH. So, if HB is tangent, then AH ⊥ HB. But HF is a chord from H to F. So, unless HF is aligned in a way that HF is colinear with AH? Or maybe not. 

Alternatively, maybe triangle FHB is a right triangle with right angle at H, so applying Pythagoras. But without more info about lengths, maybe we need to relate angles. 

But the problem gives us angles labeled 2 and 3, with measures 2x and x respectively. We need to find x. 

Looking back, the problem says m∠2 = 2x and m∠3 = x. So, likely ∠2 and ∠3 are angles in some triangle or configuration involving the circle and lines given. 

Given that there's a right angle at ∠FHB, which could be angle 2 or 3. Let me check the original question again. It says "m∠2 = 2x, m∠3 = x. Find m∠3." So, probably angles 2 and 3 are two angles in a triangle or something. 

Assuming that ∠2 and ∠3 are angles in triangle FHB, where ∠FHB is the right angle. Wait, but that would make ∠FHB = 90°, so if ∠2 and ∠3 are the other two angles, then they would add up to 90°. Suppose ∠2 is one acute angle and ∠3 is another. Then, 2x + x = 90° → 3x = 90° → x=30°, making m∠3 = 30°, which would be answer A. But let me verify if that's the case. 

But why would ∠2 and ∠3 be those angles? Let me check the setup again. 

We have points F, H, B with ∠FHB being a right angle. So, maybe ∠2 is ∠HFB and ∠3 is ∠HBF? Or vice versa. Let me think. 

In triangle FHB, if ∠H is 90°, then ∠F + ∠B = 90°. If ∠2 and ∠3 are these two angles, then yes, their sum is 90°, leading to x=30. But how do we know which angle is which? 

Alternatively, maybe there's another triangle. Let me look at the circle. Since FJ is the diameter, and H is a point on the circle. Then, angle FHJ would be a right angle, per Thales' theorem. Wait, if J is the other endpoint of the diameter, then any point on the circle, like H, would form a right angle with F and J. So ∠FHJ is 90°. 

But in our case, the right angle is at H, between F and B, not J. So maybe B is point J? No, because the right angle is at H, so if B were J, then ∠FHB would be ∠F H J, which is indeed a right angle. Wait, that's possible! 

So if B is J, then ∠FHB is ∠F H J, which is a right angle. So, in that case, triangle FHJ is a right triangle with right angle at H. Then, angles at F and J would be complementary. But the problem refers to angles 2 and 3. Maybe angles 2 and 3 are angles at F and J? 

But the problem states that m∠2 = 2x and m∠3 = x. If those are angles at F and J, then their sum is 90°, so 2x + x = 90° → x=30. Hence, m∠3 would be 30°, answer A. 

But how do we know that B is J? Well, the problem includes point J, and the right angle is at H between F and B. If B were J, then that would make sense. 

Alternatively, maybe B is another point. Let me check the given lines. The lines given are Line(F,G), Line(F,H), Line(G,H), Line(F,J), Line(H,J). So, H is connected to J. So, if we consider triangle FHJ, then H is connected to J, F is connected to J. So, angle at H between F and J is a right angle. Therefore, ∠F H J is 90°, which is the same as saying ∠FHB if B is J. 

Therefore, assuming that B is J, then the right angle is at H between F and J. Thus, the right triangle is FHJ. Then, angles at F and J would be complementary. If those are angles 2 and 3, then their measures would be 2x and x, adding to 90°, giving x=30. 

But how do we confirm that angles 2 and 3 correspond to those angles? The problem doesn't specify, but since there are only two angles in the triangle besides the right angle, and the question gives two variables, it's plausible. 

Another possibility: maybe there's another triangle involving point B. But since B isn't mentioned elsewhere except in the right angle, and given the lines, it's likely B is J. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a different configuration. For example, if B is another point on the circle, creating some other triangle. But without more info, it's hard to say. However, given the presence of Line(H,J) and the right angle at H, it seems that B is J. 

Thus, proceeding with that assumption, the angles in triangle FHJ are 90°, angle at F (let's call it angle 2), and angle at J (angle 3). If m∠2 = 2x and m∠3 = x, then 2x + x = 90° → x=30°, so answer A. 

But wait, let me check if there's another relationship. Since FJ is the diameter, and H is a point on the circle, then the length of FH can be found using the circle's properties. But since we don't have actual lengths, maybe trigonometry applies. Alternatively, maybe there are other triangles or properties. 

For instance, since AG and AH are radii, and FJ is the diameter. Let me think about coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to the points would help. 

Let me place the circle with center A at the origin (0,0). Let’s assume the circle has radius r. Then, points G and H are on the circle, so their coordinates satisfy x² + y² = r². 

Since FJ is the diameter, suppose F is (-r, 0) and J is (r, 0), making FJ horizontal. Then, point H is another point on the circle. Let me pick coordinates for H. Let's say H is at (0, r), making AH vertical. Then, line FH connects (-r, 0) to (0, r). The slope of FH is (r - 0)/(0 - (-r)) = r / r = 1. So, the line FH has equation y = x + r? Wait, plugging in F(-r, 0): y - 0 = 1*(x + r) → y = x + r. Wait, but when x=0, y=r, which matches H(0,r). 

Then, if the right angle is at H between F and B, then HB is perpendicular to FH. The slope of FH is 1, so the slope of HB should be -1. So, starting from H(0, r), moving along a line with slope -1. Let me parametrize HB. 

Parametric equations for HB: starting at (0, r), direction vector (1, -1). So any point on HB can be written as (t, r - t). 

But where is point B? If B is on this line, then its coordinates are (t, r - t) for some t. But without more constraints, it's unclear. However, if we consider the triangle FHJ, with J at (r, 0), then angle at H between F and J is already a right angle. So in that case, B would be J. 

Therefore, if B is J, then ∠FHB is ∠F H J, which is the right angle. Thus, the triangle FHJ is right-angled at H. 

In that case, angles at F and J are complementary. Let’s denote angle at F as ∠JFH = 2x, and angle at J as ∠FJH = x. Their sum is 90°, so 2x + x = 90° ⇒ x = 30°, so m∠3 = x = 30°, answer A. 

This seems consistent. Another way to check: In triangle FHJ, since FJ is the diameter, then FH and HJ are legs of the right triangle. The angles at F and J depend on the lengths of FH and HJ. 

But since H is a point on the circle, FH is a chord. Let me compute the lengths. Assuming radius r, coordinates as before. 

Point F is (-r, 0), H is (0, r). Distance FH is sqrt[(0 - (-r))² + (r - 0)^2] = sqrt(r² + r²) = r√2. 

Distance HJ: J is (r, 0), H is (0, r). Same calculation, distance is sqrt[(r - 0)^2 + (0 - r)^2] = sqrt(r² + r²) = r√2. So FH = HJ. Therefore, triangle FHJ is an isosceles right triangle. Therefore, angles at F and J are equal. Wait, but according to earlier, they were supposed to be 2x and x. Contradiction? 

Wait, if FH = HJ, then the triangle is isosceles with legs FH and HJ equal, so angles opposite them are equal. Wait, but in this case, the legs are FH and HJ, so angles at J and F would be equal. But according to the problem, they are 2x and x. Which would imply that they aren't equal. So this contradicts. 

Hmm, that suggests my previous assumption is wrong. So maybe B is not J. Then where is B? 

Alternative scenario: Perhaps B is not on the circle. Let me reconsider. 

Suppose that ∠FHB is a right angle, with B outside the circle. Then, triangle FHB has a right angle at H. Let me consider the properties. 

Since H is on the circle with center A, and F is also on the circle. So, AF = AH = radius. Let me take coordinates again. Let me set A at (0,0), F at (-1,0), J at (1,0) so that FJ is diameter of unit circle. Let me choose H at (0,1), so that AH is vertical. 

Then, HF is from (-1,0) to (0,1), which has slope (1-0)/(0 - (-1)) = 1. So, slope of HF is 1. Then, HB is perpendicular to HF, so slope of HB is -1. So, line HB passes through H(0,1) with slope -1: equation y - 1 = -1(x - 0) → y = -x + 1. 

Point B is somewhere on this line. Let me pick B as the intersection of this line with something else. But since there's no other specified lines, maybe B is arbitrary? Unless there's another condition. 

But the problem mentions angles 2 and 3. If we consider triangle FHB, then angles at F and B. Let me calculate those angles. 

Coordinates: F(-1,0), H(0,1), B(t, -t + 1). Let me compute vectors. 

Vector HF goes from H to F: (-1 - 0, 0 - 1) = (-1, -1). Vector HB goes from H to B: (t - 0, (-t +1) - 1) = (t, -t). 

So, angle at H is 90°, as required. Now, angles at F and B. To find angle at F (∠HFB), which is angle between vectors FH and BF. 

Vector FH is from F to H: (0 - (-1), 1 - 0) = (1,1). Vector FB is from F to B: (t - (-1), (-t +1) - 0) = (t+1, -t +1). 

The angle between vectors FH and FB can be found via dot product. 

Dot product of FH and FB: (1)(t+1) + (1)(-t +1) = t +1 - t +1 = 2. 

Magnitude of FH: sqrt(1² +1²) = √2. 

Magnitude of FB: sqrt((t+1)^2 + (-t +1)^2) = sqrt{(t^2 + 2t +1) + (t^2 -2t +1)} = sqrt{2t² + 2} = √(2(t² +1)). 

So cos(theta) = 2 / [√2 * √(2(t² +1))] ) = 2 / [√(4(t² +1))] ) = 2 / [2√(t² +1)] = 1 / √(t² +1). 

So angle at F is arccos(1 / √(t² +1)). Similarly, angle at B would depend on t. 

But how does this relate to angles 2 and 3? Without knowing t, it's hard to determine. However, the problem states that m∠2 = 2x and m∠3 = x. So, perhaps there is a specific position of B that makes this true. 

Alternatively, maybe there is a property I'm missing. Let me think again. 

Since H is on the circle, and FJ is the diameter. Maybe there's a relationship between angles involving arcs. For instance, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its arc. 

But angle at H is a right angle, so the arc FJ would be 180°, which makes sense as it's a diameter. 

But if there's a triangle involving B, maybe B lies on some other circle or has a particular property. 

Wait, another thought: If ∠FHB is a right angle, then B lies on the circle with diameter FH. This is due to the converse of Thales' theorem. So, any point B such that ∠FHB is a right angle lies on the circle with diameter FH. 

But since H is on the original circle (centered at A), and F is also on that circle. So, the circle with diameter FH has center at the midpoint of FH and radius half of FH. 

But how does this help? 

Maybe combining both circles. The original circle has center A, and the new circle with diameter FH. Their intersection points might give us location of B. 

But without more info, it's still unclear. 

Wait, going back to the initial problem statement. The user mentioned several lines: Line(F,G), Line(F,H), Line(G,H), Line(F,J), Line(H,J). So, points G and H are connected to F and each other. Also, Line(H,J) exists. 

So, perhaps there's a quadrilateral or polygon involving these points. For example, points F, G, H, J. 

Since AG and AH are radii, and FJ is the diameter. Let me think about triangle AGH. Since AG and AH are radii, triangle AGH is isosceles with AG = AH. 

But how does that relate to the rest? 

Alternatively, since FJ is the diameter, and H is a point on the circle, then the angle ∠FHA is... Let me think. Since A is the center, HA is a radius, and FA is also a radius (since F is on the circle)? Wait, no. Wait, F is an endpoint of the diameter, so AF is a radius. Yes, because the diameter is twice the radius. So, AF = AJ = radius. 

Therefore, AH is also a radius. So, in triangle AFH, sides AF and AH are both radii, so it's an isosceles triangle with base FH. 

The base angles at F and H are equal. Wait, but angle at H is ∠AHF. 

But how does this tie into the right angle at ∠FHB? 

Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between the angles in triangle AFH and the angles in triangle FHB. 

But I'm getting stuck here. Let me go back to the earlier contradiction where assuming B is J leads to an isosceles triangle with angles 45° each, but the problem states angles 2x and x. 

Wait, if triangle FHJ is isosceles right triangle, then angles at F and J are each 45°, which would mean that if one is 2x and the other is x, then either 2x=45 and x=22.5, or x=45 and 2x=90, but that would require x=45, which is answer B. But that conflicts with the earlier conclusion. 

But this suggests inconsistency. Where is the mistake?

Ah, if triangle FHJ is isosceles right triangle, then angles at F and J are 45° each. So, if angles 2 and 3 are those angles, then depending on labeling. If angle 2 is at F and angle 3 is at J, then m∠2 = 45°, m∠3 = 45°, which doesn't fit 2x and x. But if one of them is 2x and the other is x, then they would have to be 45° and 22.5°, but that doesn't align with the problem's setup. 

This suggests that my assumption that B is J is incorrect. 

Alternative approach: Let's use the fact that AG and AH are radii, and FJ is the diameter. So, AF = AJ = radius, and AG = AH = radius. 

Let me consider triangle AGH: since AG = AH, it's isosceles. Let's say angle at A is θ. Then, base angles at G and H are (180° - θ)/2. 

But how does this relate to other parts? 

Alternatively, since FJ is the diameter, and H is a point on the circle, then ∠FHA is an inscribed angle. Wait, no. H is on the circle, so angle subtended by arc FA at H. Wait, arc FA would be from F to A, but A is the center, not a point on the circle. Wait, no. Points on the circle are F, G, H, J. A is the center. 

So, for example, the arc from F to H would correspond to the central angle ∠FAH. Since AF and AH are radii, ∠FAH is the central angle corresponding to arc FH. 

The measure of arc FH is equal to the central angle ∠FAH. 

Now, if we consider the inscribed angle over arc FH, it would be half of that. For example, any point on the circumference forming an angle with F and H would be half of ∠FAH. 

But how does this relate to the right angle at ∠FHB? 

If ∠FHB is a right angle, then it is an inscribed angle subtending arc FB. Wait, no. The inscribed angle theorem says that an inscribed angle subtends an arc. So, if ∠FHB is an inscribed angle, then it subtends arc FB. 

But ∠FHB is a right angle, so the arc it subtends must be 180°, making FB a diameter. Therefore, FB is a diameter. 

Wait, this is interesting. So, if ∠FHB is a right angle, then arc FB must be 180°, so FB is a diameter. Therefore, B is a point such that FB is a diameter. But F is already an endpoint of the diameter FJ. So, if FB is a diameter, then B must be J, because FJ is the diameter. So, B is J. 

But earlier, this led to a contradiction where angles at F and J in triangle FHJ are both 45°, conflicting with the given relations. What's the issue here?

Wait, if FB is a diameter, then B is J. So, triangle FHJ is right-angled at H, with FB as diameter. So, in this case, triangle FHJ is a right triangle with FB as hypotenuse. 

Wait, but in this case, FH and HJ are the legs. Earlier calculation showed that FH = HJ, making it isosceles, hence angles at F and J are equal. 

But the problem states that m∠2 = 2x and m∠3 = x, implying that they are not equal. This suggests that my assumption that B is J is incorrect. 

Where is the error? Let me re-examine the logic. 

If ∠FHB is a right angle, then it subtends an arc FB, which must be 180°, making FB a diameter. Therefore, B is the other endpoint of the diameter from F. Since FJ is the diameter, then B must be J. So, this seems unavoidable. 

But then, why does this lead to a contradiction? Maybe because in this scenario, the angles at F and J are equal, but the problem states they are in ratio 2:1. 

This suggests that either the problem has a typo, or my understanding is flawed. 

Wait, perhaps the right angle is not in triangle FHJ but in another triangle. For example, if B is not J, but another point. 

Let me consider that B is not J, but another point such that ∠FHB is a right angle. As previously, B lies on the circle with diameter FH. Let me find the intersection of this circle with other elements. 

Original circle has center A, with F and J as ends of diameter. The circle with diameter FH has center at the midpoint of FH and radius FH/2. 

Let me calculate coordinates again. Assume A at (0,0), F at (-1,0), J at (1,0), H at (0,1). Midpoint of FH is at ((-1 + 0)/2, (0 + 1)/2) = (-0.5, 0.5). Radius is distance from midpoint to F: sqrt[(-0.5 +1)^2 + (0.5 - 0)^2] = sqrt[(0.5)^2 + (0.5)^2] = sqrt(0.25 + 0.25) = sqrt(0.5) ≈ 0.707. 

So, the circle with diameter FH has equation (x + 0.5)^2 + (y - 0.5)^2 = 0.5. 

Now, where does this circle intersect the original circle (center A(0,0), radius 1)? 

Original circle: x² + y² = 1. 

Subtracting the two equations: 
(x + 0.5)^2 + (y - 0.5)^2 = 0.5  
Expanding: x² + x + 0.25 + y² - y + 0.25 = 0.5  
Combine terms: x² + y² + x - y + 0.5 = 0.5  
Simplify: x² + y² + x - y = 0  
But from original circle, x² + y² = 1. Substitute:  
1 + x - y = 0 → x - y = -1 → x = y - 1. 

Substitute x = y - 1 into x² + y² = 1:  
(y - 1)^2 + y² = 1  
Expand: y² - 2y + 1 + y² = 1  
Combine: 2y² - 2y + 1 = 1  
Subtract 1: 2y² - 2y = 0 → 2y(y - 1) = 0 → y = 0 or y = 1. 

If y = 0, then x = -1 → point F(-1,0). 

If y = 1, then x = 0 → point H(0,1). 

So, the only intersections are F and H. Thus, the circle with diameter FH intersects the original circle only at F and H. So, point B cannot be on the original circle, unless it's F or H. 

But the problem mentions point B, so it must be a distinct point. Hence, B is not on the original circle. 

Thus, B is somewhere off the original circle, on the circle with diameter FH. Let me pick a point B on this circle, not coinciding with F or H. 

For example, taking parameter t such that B is (t, -t + 1) as before. Let's choose t=1, then B is (1, 0), which is point J. But that brings us back to the earlier contradiction. 

If I choose another t, say t=0, then B is (0, 1), which is point H itself. Not helpful. 

What if t=2? Then B is (2, -1). Let's calculate the angles in triangle FHB. 

Points: F(-1,0), H(0,1), B(2,-1). 

Compute vectors for angles at F and B. 

At F: vectors FH and FB. 

Vector FH: from F to H: (0 - (-1), 1 - 0) = (1,1). 

Vector FB: from F to B: (2 - (-1), -1 - 0) = (3, -1). 

Angle at F: between vectors FH(1,1) and FB(3,-1). 

Dot product: 1*3 + 1*(-1) = 3 -1 = 2. 

Magnitude of FH: √(1² +1²) = √2. 

Magnitude of FB: √(3² + (-1)^2) = √(9 +1) = √10. 

Cosθ = 2/(√2 * √10) = 2 / (√20) = 2/(2√5) = 1/√5 ≈ 0.447. 

So angle at F is arccos(1/√5) ≈ 63.43 degrees. 

At B: vectors BH and BF. 

Vector BH: from B to H: (0 - 2, 1 - (-1)) = (-2, 2). 

Vector BF: from B to F: (-1 - 2, 0 - (-1)) = (-3, 1). 

Dot product: (-2)(-3) + (2)(1) = 6 + 2 = 8. 

Magnitude of BH: √((-2)^2 + 2^2) = √(4 +4) = √8 = 2√2. 

Magnitude of BF: √((-3)^2 + 1^2) = √(9 +1) = √10. 

Cosθ = 8/(2√2 * √10) = 8/(2√20) = 4/(2√5) = 2/√5 ≈ 0.894. 

Angle at B is arccos(2/√5) ≈ 26.57 degrees. 

These angles add up to approximately 63.43 + 26.57 ≈ 90°, which checks out. 

So, if these are angles 2 and 3, with m∠2 = 2x and m∠3 = x, then:

Let's say angle at F is 2x ≈ 63.43°, and angle at B is x ≈ 26.57°. 

Check if 2x = 63.43 and x = 26.57: 2x = 2*26.57 ≈ 53.14 ≠ 63.43. Doesn't match. 

Alternatively, if angle at B is 2x and angle at F is x: 2x ≈ 26.57 and x ≈ 63.43. Also not matching. 

But if we take the exact values: 

From above, angle at F is arccos(1/√5). Let me calculate its exact value. 

cosθ = 1/√5, so θ = arctan( (opposite/adjacent) ). Wait, in the triangle, if we consider the vector FH(1,1) and FB(3,-1). 

Alternatively, tanθ = |slope of FB| ? Not directly. 

Alternatively, using the exact expression: 

tan(angle at F) = |(m_FB - m_FH)/(1 + m_FB*m_FH)|. 

Slope of FH is (1-0)/(0 - (-1)) = 1. 

Slope of FB is (-1 - 0)/(2 - (-1)) = -1/3. 

So, tan(angle between them) = |(m2 - m1)/(1 + m1*m2)| = |(-1/3 - 1)/(1 + (1)(-1/3))| = |(-4/3)/(2/3)| = |-4/3 * 3/2| = 2. 

So, tan(angle at F) = 2 → angle at F = arctan(2) ≈ 63.43°. 

Similarly, angle at B: 

Slope of BH: from B(2,-1) to H(0,1): (1 - (-1))/(0 - 2) = 2/-2 = -1. 

Slope of BF: from B(2,-1) to F(-1,0): (0 - (-1))/(-1 - 2) = 1/-3 = -1/3. 

Angle between slopes -1 and -1/3. 

tan(angle) = |(m2 - m1)/(1 + m1*m2)| = |(-1/3 - (-1))/(1 + (-1)(-1/3))| = |(2/3)/(1 + 1/3)| = |(2/3)/(4/3)| = 2/4 = 1/2. 

So angle at B is arctan(1/2) ≈ 26.57°. 

So, these angles are arctan(2) and arctan(1/2). These are complementary, since tan(arctan(2)) * tan(arctan(1/2)) = 2 * 1/2 = 1, implying they are complementary. 

So, if these are the two angles, and one is 2x, the other x, then:

Case 1: arctan(2) = 2x and arctan(1/2) = x. Check if 2x = 2 * arctan(1/2). Let me compute 2 * arctan(1/2). 

But arctan(1/2) is approximately 26.57°, so 2x would be 53.14°, while arctan(2) is approximately 63.43°, so this doesn't hold. 

Case 2: arctan(1/2) = 2x and arctan(2) = x. Then x ≈ 63.43°, and 2x ≈ 126.86°, which doesn't match arctan(1/2). 

So this suggests that the angles are not in the ratio 2:1. 

But the problem states that m∠2 = 2x and m∠3 = x. This implies that the two angles are in a 2:1 ratio. 

How can this happen? Let me think. 

Perhaps there's a specific position of B where this ratio holds. Let's set up equations. 

Let me denote the angle at F as α and at B as β, with α + β = 90°. 

Given that α = 2β or β = 2α. 

Let me explore both cases. 

Case 1: α = 2β. Since α + β = 90°, substituting: 2β + β = 90° → β = 30°, α = 60°. 

Case 2: β = 2α. Then α + 2α = 90° → α = 30°, β = 60°. 

Either way, one angle is 30°, the other 60°. 

So, if one of the angles is 30°, and the other 60°, then x would be 30° or 60°. 

So, let's try to find B such that either angle at F is 60° or 30°. 

Let me first try to find B such that angle at F is 60°. 

Using the earlier coordinate system: F(-1,0), H(0,1), B(t, -t + 1). 

We want angle at F to be 60°. 

As before, the angle at F is between vectors FH and FB. 

We can use the formula for the angle between two vectors. 

Let me denote vector FH = (1,1), vector FB = (t + 1, -t + 1). 

The cosine of the angle between them is (FH · FB) / (|FH| |FB|). 

Earlier, this was 2 / (√2 * √[(t+1)^2 + (-t +1)^2]) = 2 / [√2 * √(2t² + 2)] = 2 / [√2 * √2 * √(t² + 1)] = 2 / [2√(t² +1)] = 1 / √(t² +1). 

So, cos(angle at F) = 1 / √(t² +1). 

Set this equal to cos(60°) = 0.5. 

So, 1 / √(t² +1) = 0.5 → √(t² +1) = 2 → t² +1 = 4 → t² = 3 → t = ±√3. 

So, t = √3 or t = -√3. 

Let's take t = √3. Then, point B is (√3, -√3 +1). 

Now, let's compute the angle at B. Since total is 90°, angle at B is 30°, which would make x = 30°. 

So, in this case, m∠3 = 30°, which is answer A. 

This fits the conditions! 

So, the angle at F is 60°, angle at B is 30°, which corresponds to m∠2 = 60° = 2x and m∠3 = 30° = x. Hence, x = 30°. 

Thus, the correct answer is A. 

This shows that by choosing t = √3, we get the desired angle ratios. 

Therefore, even though initially there seemed to be contradictions, by considering B as a specific point on the circle with diameter FH, we arrive at the solution where x = 30°, matching answer A. 

So, the correct answer is A.
