<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have several points and lines, some circles, and certain conditions about angles and lengths. Let me start by listing out all the given information to get a clear picture.

First, the given predicates:

- Circle(B): So there's a circle with center at point B.
- Points H, F, G, J are defined.
- Line(B,H) and Line(B,J): So points H and J are connected to B, forming two lines from B.
- Line(F,G): A line connecting points F and G.
- Tangent(Line(F,G), Circle(B)): This means the line FG is tangent to the circle centered at B. Therefore, the radius at the point of tangency should be perpendicular to FG.
- MeasureOf(Angle(F,G,B)) equals 70 degrees. Wait, Angle(F,G,B) would be the angle at point G between points F, G, and B? Or maybe I need to check how angles are denoted here. Typically, angle ABC is the angle at point B, so Angle(F,G,B) would be the angle at point G between points F, G, and B. Wait, but if it's written as MeasureOf(Angle(F,G,B)), then the vertex is G. But since FG is a tangent to the circle at B? Hmm, wait, maybe I need to clarify.

Wait, the tangent line is Line(F,G) touching the circle B. Since the circle is centered at B, then the tangent line FG must touch the circle at exactly one point. However, the line FG is tangent to the circle, so the distance from the center B to the line FG must be equal to the radius. Also, the radius at the point of tangency is perpendicular to FG. But where is the point of tangency? It could be a different point, but perhaps the line FG touches the circle at some point, say, maybe point F or G? Not sure yet.

But also, there's another condition: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(F,G,B)), 70). So angle at G, formed by points F, G, B. So angle FGB is 70 degrees. Then, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(H,B,J)), x). So angle at B between points H, B, J is x degrees. And other conditions: Equals(LengthOf(Line(H,J)), LengthOf(Line(H,G))). So HJ = HG. Also, Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,G)), LengthOf(Line(H,F))). So FG = HF.

So the goal is to find x, which is the measure of angle HBJ.

Let me try to visualize this. There's a circle with center B. Lines BH and BJ go from B to points H and J. Line FG is tangent to the circle, so it touches the circle at some point, maybe at F or G? Wait, but F and G are endpoints of the tangent line. Wait, the tangent line FG is tangent to the circle. Therefore, the line FG touches the circle at exactly one point. Since B is the center, the radius to the point of tangency should be perpendicular to FG.

But how do we know where the point of tangency is? Maybe it's not necessarily F or G. But maybe there's more info. Let's think.

Also, given that FG is tangent to the circle, so the distance from B to line FG is equal to the radius. Also, because FG is tangent, then BF or BG might be radii? Wait, no. Because if the tangent line FG touches the circle at a point, say, T, then BT is perpendicular to FG. But unless F or G is T, which isn't stated. However, given that we have other length equalities: FG = HF. Also, HJ = HG. So maybe H is somewhere such that those lengths are equal.

Alternatively, maybe triangle HFG has some properties. Let me consider the given lengths:

FG = HF (from Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,G)), LengthOf(Line(H,F))) )

And HJ = HG (from Equals(LengthOf(Line(H,J)), LengthOf(Line(H,G))) )

So HF = FG and HJ = HG. So maybe triangles HFG and HJG are isosceles?

Wait, but HJ = HG implies triangle HJG is isosceles with base JG and legs HJ and HG. Similarly, HF = FG implies triangle HFG is isosceles with base HF and legs FG and HF? Wait, no—if HF = FG, then triangle HFG has sides HF and FG equal, making it isosceles with base HG? Wait, the vertices are H, F, G. So HF and FG are the two equal sides. So the apex is at F? Wait, no. In triangle HFG, the sides are HF, FG, and GH. If HF = FG, then the two equal sides are HF and FG, so the apex is at F, and the base is HG. So angle at F is the vertex angle.

But angle at G in triangle HFG is part of the angle mentioned earlier, which was angle FGB = 70 degrees. Wait, angle FGB is at point G, between F, G, B. So that angle is 70 degrees. So maybe that relates to some triangle involving G, B, and another point.

Since FG is tangent to the circle centered at B, then the radius to the point of tangency is perpendicular to FG. Let me denote the point of tangency as T. So BT is perpendicular to FG. But where is T? It could be any point on FG, but since B is the center, the line BT would be the radius. However, without knowing where T is, maybe we can relate this to other parts of the diagram.

Alternatively, maybe F or G lies on the circle? For example, if F is on the circle, then BF would be a radius. But since FG is tangent to the circle, if F were on the circle, then the tangent at F would be perpendicular to BF. But in this case, FG is tangent, so if F is on the circle, then FG would be tangent at F, hence FG ⊥ BF. Similarly, if G is on the circle, then FG would be tangent at G, so FG ⊥ BG.

But given that we don't know whether F or G lie on the circle, but since FG is tangent to the circle, at least one of them could be on the circle. Alternatively, neither is on the circle, but the line FG is tangent elsewhere. But perhaps we can assume that the tangent point is F or G? Let's explore possibilities.

Suppose FG is tangent at F. Then FG is perpendicular to BF. So angle between FG and BF is 90 degrees. Similarly, if tangent at G, then FG is perpendicular to BG.

Now, looking back at angle FGB being 70 degrees. If FG is tangent at G, then BG is perpendicular to FG, so angle between BG and FG is 90 degrees. But angle FGB is the angle at G between F, G, B. That would mean that angle between FG and GB is 70 degrees. But if FG is tangent at G, then BG is perpendicular to FG, so angle between FG and BG would be 90 degrees. But according to the given, it's 70 degrees. Contradiction. Hence, FG cannot be tangent at G. Therefore, the point of tangency must be another point, not G. Similarly, if FG is tangent at F, then BF is perpendicular to FG. Let's see. In that case, angle between BF and FG is 90 degrees. Now, angle FGB is at G, between F, G, B. Let me imagine triangle FGB. If FG is tangent at F, then BF is perpendicular to FG. So in triangle FGB, angle at F is 90 degrees. Then angle at G would be something. But given that angle FGB is 70 degrees, then angle at G is 70 degrees. So in triangle FGB, angles sum to 180. So angle at F is 90, angle at G is 70, so angle at B would be 20 degrees. But I'm not sure if that helps yet.

Alternatively, maybe the tangent point is not F or G. Suppose the tangent point is some other point T on FG. Then BT is perpendicular to FG. However, without knowing where T is, it's hard to proceed. But given that we have other conditions involving points H, J, maybe we can find relations.

Another thing: HJ = HG and HF = FG. Let me note that.

So HF = FG, so triangle HFG has HF = FG. Also, HJ = HG. So if we can relate these lengths, maybe we can form some triangles.

Additionally, angle HBJ is x, which is the angle at B between H and J. So points H and J are connected to B, forming angle x.

Perhaps there's a way to connect these triangles via some properties. Let me try to sketch mentally.

Let me consider triangle HFG: HF = FG, so it's isosceles with base HG. Wait, HF = FG, so the two equal sides are HF and FG. So the apex is at F. Therefore, the base angles at H and G are equal. Wait, but angle at G is angle FGH. Which is part of angle FGB, which is given as 70 degrees. Wait, angle FGB is at G between F, G, B. So angle FGB is adjacent to angle FGH? If H is connected to G, then angle FGH would be part of angle FGB. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, maybe triangle HGF has some relation to the tangent line. Given that FG is tangent to the circle, and H is connected to G and J. Also, HJ = HG. So H is equidistant from G and J, implying that H lies on the perpendicular bisector of segment GJ. But without knowing where J is, this might not directly help.

Alternatively, considering that H is connected to J and G, and HJ = HG, so triangle HJG is isosceles with HJ = HG. Therefore, angles at J and G are equal. Wait, but again, not sure.

Let me think about the tangent line FG. Since it's tangent to the circle at B? No, the circle is centered at B. Wait, the circle is centered at B, so the radius is from B to any point on the circle. The tangent line FG touches the circle at exactly one point, say T. Then BT is perpendicular to FG. So BT ⊥ FG.

But if we can find coordinates or use coordinate geometry, maybe that would help. Let me try assigning coordinates.

Let me place point B at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Let me assume that the circle has radius r. Then, the tangent line FG must satisfy the condition that the distance from B (origin) to line FG is equal to r.

Let me suppose that line FG is horizontal for simplicity. Wait, but direction may vary. Alternatively, choose coordinates so that the tangent line FG is horizontal, and the point of tangency is at (a, b), but this might complicate things. Alternatively, take specific positions.

Alternatively, since angle FGB is 70 degrees, and FG is tangent to the circle. If I can find relations between angles and lengths.

Wait, going back to the tangent line. Since FG is tangent to the circle at some point T. Then BT is perpendicular to FG. Let me consider that. So if I can find the position of T relative to other points.

But maybe there's a better approach. Let's look at the given angles and lengths.

We have angle FGB = 70°, and we need to find angle HBJ = x. Also, HF = FG, HJ = HG. Let me consider triangles involving these lengths.

In triangle HFG, since HF = FG, it's an isosceles triangle with HF = FG. Therefore, angles opposite those sides are equal. Wait, the sides HF and FG are equal, so the angles opposite them would be ∠HGF and ∠FHG. Wait, ∠HGF is at G, and ∠FHG is at H. So those angles are equal. Wait, but angle at G (∠HGF) is part of angle FGB. Since angle FGB is given as 70°, which is ∠FGB. How does ∠HGF relate to ∠FGB?

Assuming that points H, G, and B are arranged such that line HB connects to B, and line GB connects to B. So if H is connected to G, then ∠HGF is the angle at G between H, G, F. Whereas ∠FGB is the angle at G between F, G, B. So unless H, F, and B are colinear, these angles are separate. Wait, but maybe H is positioned such that line HG is part of some structure.

Alternatively, maybe triangle HGB is involved. Let me think.

Given that HJ = HG, so H is equidistant from J and G. Therefore, H lies on the perpendicular bisector of segment JG. But without knowing where J is, this is tricky.

Alternatively, since H is connected to J and G, and HJ = HG, then triangle HJG is isosceles with base JG and equal sides HJ and HG. Therefore, angles at J and G are equal.

But how does this tie into the rest?

Also, HF = FG. So HF = FG, which suggests that triangle HFG is isosceles with HF = FG, leading to angles at H and G being equal.

Wait, but angle at G (∠HGF) is part of angle FGB = 70°. So if ∠HGF is equal to some angle, maybe we can express ∠FGB in terms of other angles.

Let me try to write down equations.

In triangle HFG:

HF = FG ⇒ ∠HGF = ∠FHG.

Let’s call ∠HGF = ∠FHG = y.

Then, the third angle at F is 180° - 2y.

But angle at F is ∠HFG, which is adjacent to angle FGB. Wait, maybe not directly. Unless points H, F, and B are aligned somehow.

Alternatively, since FG is tangent to the circle at some point, and B is the center. Let me recall that the tangent line FG creates a right angle with the radius at the point of tangency. So if the tangent point is T, then BT ⊥ FG. So if I can find where T is, maybe it's related to other points.

But without knowing where T is, maybe I need to relate it through other given data.

Another thought: Since HF = FG and FG is tangent to the circle, then HF is equal to the length of the tangent from H to the circle. Wait, the length of the tangent from a point to a circle is sqrt(OH² - r²), where O is the center. But since HF is equal to FG, which is the length of the tangent from H to the circle? Wait, if the tangent from H to the circle is HF, then HF^2 = HB^2 - r^2. But since FG is the tangent segment, which is equal to HF. Wait, but FG is a line segment, not necessarily the entire tangent. Wait, maybe FG is the tangent segment from F to the circle, but if F is outside the circle, then the length from F to the point of tangency is the tangent length. However, if F is on the circle, then the tangent length is zero, but FG would be zero, which contradicts unless FG=0. So likely, F is outside the circle, and FG is the tangent from F to the circle. Wait, but FG is a line segment; if it's a tangent, then it starts at F and touches the circle at one point. But the length from F to the point of tangency is the tangent length. So if HF = FG, then HF is equal to that tangent length. So HF^2 = HB^2 - r^2. But I don't know if that helps directly.

Alternatively, maybe triangle HBF is a right triangle? If FG is tangent at some point, say T, then BT ⊥ FG. But if H is such that HF = FT (since HF = FG?), but I'm not sure.

This seems getting complicated. Let me try to focus on the angles first.

We know angle FGB = 70°, which is at point G between F, G, B. Also, from the tangent condition, if we consider the right angle between BT and FG, where T is the point of tangency.

Assume that the tangent point is T, so BT ⊥ FG. Then, triangle BTF is a right triangle at T. Also, BT is the radius, so BT = r. Then, FT (the tangent segment) is equal to sqrt(HB² - r²) if H is the external point. Wait, but I don't know where H is located.

Alternatively, since HF = FG, maybe F is the external point, and FG is the tangent segment. So the length of the tangent from F to the circle is FG. Therefore, FG² = FB² - r². But FB is the distance from F to the center B. But without knowing FB, this might not help.

Alternatively, since we have angle FGB = 70°, and FG is tangent, then maybe triangle FGB has some properties. If we can find relations between angles in that triangle.

Earlier, I considered if FG is tangent at F, making BF perpendicular to FG. Then in triangle FGB, angle at F is 90°, angle at G is 70°, so angle at B would be 20°. Then, maybe that angle at B (angle FBG) is 20°, which could relate to other angles.

But how does this connect to the rest? If angle FBG is 20°, then maybe there's a relationship with angle HBJ = x?

Alternatively, if FG is tangent at some other point, but I need more clues.

Let me try assuming that FG is tangent at F. Then, as before, BF is perpendicular to FG. So angle between BF and FG is 90°. Then, in triangle FGB, angle at F is 90°, angle at G is 70°, so angle at B (FBG) is 10°? Wait, angles sum to 180: 90 + 70 + angle at B = 180 → angle at B is 20°. So angle FBG is 20°. 

Now, what about other parts? We have HF = FG. If F is the point of tangency, then HF = FG implies that HF = length of tangent from F to the circle, which is zero if F is on the circle. But that would imply FG = 0, which would make F coincide with G, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, this assumption leads to contradiction. Hence, FG cannot be tangent at F. So the tangent point is not F.

Similarly, if tangent at G, then BG is perpendicular to FG. Then, in triangle FGB, angle at G would be 90°, but given angle at G is 70°, contradiction. Hence, the tangent point is not G either. So the tangent point must be some other point T on FG, not coinciding with F or G.

Therefore, line FG is tangent to the circle at point T, and BT is perpendicular to FG.

Now, since BT is perpendicular to FG, and B is the center, then BT is a radius. So BT = radius.

But how to relate this to other parts?

Maybe consider triangle BTF, which is a right triangle at T. So BT² + TF² = BF². But I don't know TF or BF.

Alternatively, since HF = FG, and H is connected to F and G, maybe there's a way to connect H to the tangent line.

Let me think about the other given equality: HJ = HG. So triangle HJG is isosceles with HJ = HG. So angles at J and G are equal. Let's denote angle at J as z and angle at G as z. Then, the third angle at H is 180 - 2z.

But how does this relate to other angles?

Also, we have HF = FG. Let's consider triangle HFG, which is isosceles with HF = FG. So angles at H and G are equal. Let's call those angles w each. Then, angle at F is 180 - 2w.

But angle at G in triangle HFG is w, which is part of angle FGB (which is 70°). So if w is part of angle FGB, then w ≤ 70°. But unless H, G, and B are colinear, which they aren't necessarily.

Wait, angle FGB is at G between F, G, B. If H is connected to G, then angle FGB is composed of angle FGH (from triangle HFG) plus some other angle? Or is it overlapping?

Maybe I need to draw a diagram mentally. Point G is connected to F and to H. Angle at G between F, G, B is 70°. So if I imagine point G, with segments GF and GB. Segment GF is part of the tangent line, and segment GB goes to the center B. Additionally, segment GH connects G to H. So angle between GF and GB is 70°, and angle between GF and GH is part of triangle HFG.

So if in triangle HFG, angle at G is w (which is ∠FGH), then angle between GF and GH is w. Then, the remaining part of angle FGB (which is 70°) would be the angle between GH and GB. Let's denote that as v. So w + v = 70°.

Now, in triangle HFG, the angles are w at G, w at H, and angle at F as 180 - 2w. 

But how does this help us? Maybe we can find relations with other parts.

Also, we have HJ = HG. So in triangle HJG, which has sides HJ = HG, so it's isosceles with base JG. So angles at J and G are equal. Let's call those angles z each. So angle at J is z, angle at G is z, and angle at H is 180 - 2z.

But how does this connect to other angles?

Alternatively, maybe there's a connection between triangles HFG and HJG. For instance, if we can find some common angles or side relations.

Also, we have HF = FG. So HF = FG. And HJ = HG. Let me think about triangles involving these lengths.

Let me consider triangle HFG: HF = FG. Let's denote HF = FG = k.

Then, in triangle HFG, sides HF = FG = k, and HG can be found using the law of cosines: HG² = HF² + FG² - 2*HF*FG*cos(angle at F).

Wait, angle at F is 180 - 2w. But I don't know what w is. Alternatively, since HF = FG, the triangle is isosceles, so HG can be expressed in terms of w. But without knowing the actual lengths, this might not help.

Alternatively, since HJ = HG, then HJ = HG. So if we can relate HJ to other lengths.

But I'm stuck here. Maybe I need to consider other approaches.

Let me think about the fact that HJ = HG. So H is equidistant from J and G. Thus, H lies on the perpendicular bisector of segment JG. So if I can find coordinates for these points, maybe I can find relations.

Let me attempt coordinate geometry. Let me set up a coordinate system.

Let me place point B at (0, 0). Let me assume the circle has radius r. Let me choose coordinates such that the tangent line FG is horizontal for simplicity. Let me assume that the point of tangency T is at (a, b), but since FG is horizontal, the slope of FG is 0, so the radius BT must be vertical (since it's perpendicular to FG). So if FG is horizontal, then BT is vertical. Therefore, the point T must lie directly above or below B. Since B is at (0,0), and BT is vertical, then T is at (0, c) or (0, -c). But since FG is tangent at T, and FG is horizontal, then the line FG is horizontal and passes through T. So the equation of FG is y = c or y = -c. Let me choose y = c for simplicity.

So, the line FG is horizontal, passing through T=(0, c). But since it's tangent to the circle centered at B=(0,0), the distance from B to FG must be equal to the radius. The distance from B=(0,0) to line FG (y = c) is |c|, which equals the radius r. So r = |c|. Let's assume c > 0, so r = c, and T=(0, c). So the tangent line FG is y = c.

Now, the points F and G lie on this tangent line. Since FG is a horizontal line y = c. Let me assign coordinates to F and G. Let me assume that F is at (-d, c) and G is at (e, c), so that FG has length d + e. Wait, but the exact positions depend on the placement. However, since HF = FG, and we need to relate to other points.

But also, we have angle FGB = 70°, which is the angle at G between F, G, B. Let me compute this angle using coordinates.

Point G is at (e, c). Point F is at (-d, c). Point B is at (0,0).

Vector GB is from G to B: (0 - e, 0 - c) = (-e, -c)

Vector GF is from G to F: (-d - e, c - c) = (-d - e, 0)

Angle between vectors GB and GF is 70 degrees. Using the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (GB · GF) / (|GB| |GF|)

Compute GB · GF = (-e)(-d - e) + (-c)(0) = e(d + e)

|GB| = sqrt(e² + c²)

|GF| = sqrt[(-d - e)^2 + 0] = |d + e|

Thus,

cos(theta) = [e(d + e)] / [sqrt(e² + c²) * |d + e|]

Assuming d + e ≠ 0, we can simplify:

cos(theta) = e / sqrt(e² + c²)

But theta is given as 70 degrees. So:

e / sqrt(e² + c²) = cos(70°)

Square both sides:

e² / (e² + c²) = cos²(70°)

Cross-multiplying:

e² = cos²(70°) * (e² + c²)

Rearranged:

e² = e² cos²(70°) + c² cos²(70°)

Bring terms with e² to left:

e² (1 - cos²(70°)) = c² cos²(70°)

Using identity 1 - cos²θ = sin²θ:

e² sin²(70°) = c² cos²(70°)

Divide both sides by cos²(70°):

e² tan²(70°) = c²

Take square root:

e tan(70°) = ±c

Since we assumed c > 0 and e is the x-coordinate of G, which is positive (assuming FG extends to the right from G), so let's take positive sign:

e = c / tan(70°)

Calculate tan(70°) ≈ 2.747, so e ≈ c / 2.747 ≈ 0.364c

So coordinates of G are (e, c) ≈ (0.364c, c)

Now, we need to incorporate the condition HF = FG. Let me find FG length. FG is from F=(-d, c) to G=(e, c), so length is e - (-d) = e + d. So FG = e + d.

But HF is the length from H to F. Let me denote H as some point (x, y). But we need to find its coordinates based on other conditions.

Also, we have HJ = HG. So the distance from H to J equals the distance from H to G.

But we don't know where J is. However, we know that Line(B,J) exists, meaning J is a point on the line from B to J. Wait, Line(B,J) is just a line starting at B and going through J. So J is somewhere along that line. But we don't know its position yet.

But we also have angle HBJ = x, which is the angle at B between H and J. So points H and J are both connected to B, forming angle x.

But this seems too vague. Perhaps there's another relation. Let me recall that HF = FG. So HF = e + d.

If I can express HF in terms of coordinates of H and F.

Let me assume H has coordinates (h_x, h_y). Then HF = sqrt[(h_x + d)^2 + (h_y - c)^2]. And this equals FG = e + d.

But without knowing H's coordinates, this might not help directly. However, we also have HJ = HG. Let me compute HG. G is at (e, c), so HG = sqrt[(h_x - e)^2 + (h_y - c)^2]. And HJ is the distance from H to J. But J is on line BJ. Since B is at (0,0), and J is a point on line BJ, which is arbitrary except for the fact that it's connected to H such that HJ = HG.

This seems too abstract. Maybe I need to make assumptions about the location of J. For example, if J is chosen such that HJ = HG and angle HBJ = x, which is our target.

Alternatively, since we're dealing with angles and lengths, maybe there's a symmetry or special property.

Let me revisit the earlier idea about triangle HFG and triangle HJG.

Since HJ = HG, and HF = FG, perhaps triangles HFG and HJG are related in some way.

Wait, if HF = FG and HJ = HG, then maybe triangles HFG and HJG have some congruence or similarity?

Not sure. Alternatively, since HF = FG and HJ = HG, perhaps there's a reflection or rotation that maps one to the other.

Alternatively, since we've got angle FGB = 70°, and need to find x = angle HBJ. Maybe there's a way to relate these angles through triangle properties.

Let me think about the earlier calculation where in the coordinate setup, we had e = c / tan(70°). So e = c / tan(70°). Let me calculate tan(70°) ≈ 2.747, so e ≈ 0.364c.

Now, FG = e + d. But we also have HF = FG. Let me assume that F is at (-d, c), G is at (e, c). What is the value of d? Well, if we can relate d to other variables.

But without more information, it's hard to determine d. However, there might be another condition from the tangent line. Since the tangent line FG is y = c, and the circle is centered at (0,0) with radius c, the tangent line touches the circle at T=(0,c). So point T is (0,c), which is on FG. But FG is from F=(-d, c) to G=(e, c). So the point T=(0,c) must lie on FG. Therefore, the x-coordinate of T is between -d and e. So 0 must be between -d and e. Assuming d > 0 and e > 0, this is true.

So the tangent point T is (0, c), which is the midpoint of FG if d = e. Wait, no. Because FG goes from x=-d to x=e, so midpoint is at x=(e - d)/2. But T is at x=0, so (e - d)/2 = 0 → e = d. So this implies that d = e. Therefore, FG has length e + d = 2e. So FG = 2e. And since HF = FG, then HF = 2e.

So HF = 2e. Let me now find HF in terms of coordinates. H is some point, F is at (-d, c) = (-e, c) since d = e. So F is at (-e, c). Let me denote H as (h_x, h_y). Then HF = sqrt[(h_x + e)^2 + (h_y - c)^2] = 2e.

Also, we have HJ = HG. Let me compute HG. G is at (e, c), so HG = sqrt[(h_x - e)^2 + (h_y - c)^2].

So HJ = HG → sqrt[(h_x - e)^2 + (h_y - c)^2] = sqrt[(h_x + e)^2 + (h_y - c)^2].

Squaring both sides:

(h_x - e)^2 + (h_y - c)^2 = (h_x + e)^2 + (h_y - c)^2

Subtract (h_y - c)^2 from both sides:

(h_x - e)^2 = (h_x + e)^2

Expanding:

h_x² - 2eh_x + e² = h_x² + 2eh_x + e²

Simplify:

-2eh_x = 2eh_x → -4eh_x = 0 → h_x = 0.

So the x-coordinate of H is 0. So H lies on the y-axis (since x=0). 

Great! So H has coordinates (0, h_y). Now, we can substitute this into the HF equation.

HF = sqrt[(0 + e)^2 + (h_y - c)^2] = sqrt[e² + (h_y - c)^2] = 2e.

So squaring:

e² + (h_y - c)^2 = 4e² → (h_y - c)^2 = 3e² → h_y - c = ±√3 e → h_y = c ± √3 e.

So H is at (0, c ± √3 e). Now, we need to determine which sign to take. Depending on the position of H relative to the circle. Since the circle is centered at (0,0) with radius c. Let's assume H is outside the circle, so its distance from B is greater than c. Let's compute the distance from H to B: sqrt[(0)^2 + (h_y)^2] = |h_y|. So |h_y| > c.

If h_y = c + √3 e, then |h_y| = c + √3 e > c, which is fine. If h_y = c - √3 e, then depending on the value of √3 e compared to c. Recall from earlier, e = c / tan(70°). Let's compute √3 e = √3 * c / tan(70°). Let me calculate tan(70°) ≈ 2.747, so √3 / 2.747 ≈ 1.732 / 2.747 ≈ 0.630. So √3 e ≈ 0.630c. So c - 0.630c = 0.37c > 0, so h_y = 0.37c > 0. So in this case, h_y = c - √3 e would be positive, and distance from H to B is 0.37c < c, meaning H is inside the circle. But since HF = 2e, and F is at (-e, c), let's check if H being inside the circle makes sense.

If H is inside the circle, then HF would be the distance from H to F. Let's see: H is at (0, c - √3 e). F is at (-e, c). Distance HF squared is (e)^2 + (√3 e)^2 = e² + 3e² = 4e² → HF = 2e, which matches. So this works regardless of whether H is inside or outside. So both solutions are possible. But since the problem doesn't specify, we need to consider both cases. However, let's see which one fits with other conditions.

Now, we also have point J, which is on line BJ. Since B is at (0,0), line BJ goes from B(0,0) through J. Let me assume J is somewhere along this line. Let me parameterize J as (k, 0), since it's on the x-axis? Wait, no. Wait, line BJ is just any line from B, but in our coordinate system, we haven't specified the direction of line BJ. Wait, originally, we have Line(B,H) and Line(B,J). So H is at (0, h_y), and J is some other point on line BJ. But since we've placed H at (0, h_y), line BH is the vertical line x=0. So line BJ is another line from B(0,0) to J. Let me assume J is at some point (m, n) such that line BJ is defined. But without loss of generality, maybe it's easier to choose coordinates for J.

But since we have HJ = HG, and H is at (0, h_y), and G is at (e, c), let me compute HG. As earlier, HG = sqrt[(0 - e)^2 + (h_y - c)^2] = sqrt[e² + (h_y - c)^2]. But earlier, we found that this equals 2e. Wait, no—wait, HF = 2e, and HJ = HG. So HJ = HG = sqrt[e² + (h_y - c)^2] = 2e. Wait, no, earlier we found that HF = 2e, and HJ = HG, which is also sqrt[e² + (h_y - c)^2]. Wait, but this would imply that HJ = 2e, but we already used that to derive h_y. So this seems consistent.

But how does this help us find angle HBJ?

Angle HBJ is the angle at B between points H and J. Since B is at (0,0), H is at (0, h_y), and J is some point on line BJ. Let me define J as a point on line BJ. Let me assume that line BJ is arbitrary, but since we need to find angle HBJ, which depends on the position of J.

However, we have another condition: HJ = HG. Since HJ = HG = 2e, and we need to determine where J is such that the distance from H to J is 2e.

Let me consider that J is somewhere on line BJ. Let me parametrize J as lying along some direction from B. Since we have freedom in choosing J, but it needs to satisfy HJ = 2e.

Let me choose coordinates for J. Let me assume that line BJ is along some direction. For simplicity, let me assume that line BJ is along the x-axis. Wait, but H is on the y-axis. If I set J on the x-axis, then angle HBJ is the angle between BH (vertical) and BJ (horizontal), which would be 90 degrees. But that might not be the case. Wait, but the problem states that Line(B,H) and Line(B,J) exist, but doesn't specify their directions. So maybe J is not on the x-axis. 

Alternatively, since we have H at (0, h_y), and need to find J such that HJ = 2e. Let me denote J as (p, q), lying on line BJ. Since B is at (0,0), line BJ can be represented parametrically as t*(some direction vector). Let me assume that J is at (t, 0) on the x-axis for simplicity, but this might restrict the generality. Let me try.

Assume J is on the x-axis, so J = (j, 0). Then, H is at (0, h_y), so the distance HJ is sqrt[(j - 0)^2 + (0 - h_y)^2] = sqrt(j² + h_y²) = 2e.

So j² + h_y² = (2e)^2 = 4e².

But we need to relate j to other parameters. However, without additional constraints, there are infinitely many J satisfying this. But since we need to find angle HBJ, which is the angle between BH and BJ.

Since BH is from B(0,0) to H(0, h_y), which is the positive y-axis. BJ is from B(0,0) to J(j, 0), which is along the x-axis. So the angle between BH (positive y-axis) and BJ (positive x-axis) is 90 degrees. But this would make x = 90°, which is not among the options. So this suggests that my assumption of J being on the x-axis is incorrect, or that this scenario is not applicable.

Alternatively, maybe J is not on the x-axis. Let me instead consider that line BJ is arbitrary, and we need to find angle HBJ such that HJ = 2e.

Let me consider that J is somewhere in the plane, and H is at (0, h_y). The locus of points J such that HJ = 2e is a circle centered at H with radius 2e. But J must also lie on line BJ, which passes through B(0,0). So J is the intersection of line BJ (passing through B) and the circle centered at H with radius 2e.

To find angle HBJ, we need to find the angle between BH and BJ, where J is on that circle.

But without knowing the exact position of J, it's difficult to determine the angle. However, there might be a unique position for J that satisfies all conditions.

Wait, but we also have other constraints. Remember, the original problem includes the tangent line FG and the angle at G being 70 degrees. Earlier, we derived that e = c / tan(70°), and h_y = c ± √3 e.

Let me substitute e = c / tan(70°). Let me compute √3 e = √3 * c / tan(70°). Let me calculate this value numerically.

tan(70°) ≈ 2.747477419

So √3 / tan(70°) ≈ 1.732 / 2.747 ≈ 0.630.

So h_y = c ± 0.630c.

Case 1: h_y = c + 0.630c = 1.630c

Case 2: h_y = c - 0.630c = 0.370c

Let me analyze both cases.

First, Case 1: h_y = 1.630c. So H is at (0, 1.630c). Now, we need to find J on line BJ such that HJ = 2e = 2*(c / tan(70°)) ≈ 2 * 0.364c = 0.728c. Wait, wait: e = c / tan(70°), so 2e = 2c / tan(70°) ≈ 0.728c. So HJ = 0.728c.

Distance from H to J is 0.728c. Let me denote J as a point on line BJ. Let me assume line BJ is arbitrary, but we need to find the angle HBJ. Let me consider that line BJ passes through B(0,0) and J, and H is at (0, 1.630c). The distance from H to J is 0.728c.

Let me parameterize J as a point on line BJ. Let me assume that line BJ makes an angle θ with the x-axis. Then, coordinates of J can be written as (t*cosθ, t*sinθ) for some t > 0.

Then, the distance HJ is sqrt[(t*cosθ - 0)^2 + (t*sinθ - 1.630c)^2] = 0.728c.

Squaring both sides:

t² cos²θ + (t sinθ - 1.630c)^2 = (0.728c)^2

Expand the second term:

t² sin²θ - 2 * 1.630c * t sinθ + (1.630c)^2

Adding the first term:

t² cos²θ + t² sin²θ - 2 * 1.630c * t sinθ + (1.630c)^2 = t² - 3.260c t sinθ + (1.630c)^2 = (0.728c)^2

So:

t² - 3.260c t sinθ + (1.630c)^2 - (0.728c)^2 = 0

Calculate constants:

(1.630c)^2 - (0.728c)^2 = c² [(1.630)^2 - (0.728)^2] ≈ c² [2.6569 - 0.530] ≈ c² * 2
