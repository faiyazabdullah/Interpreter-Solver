Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points W, X, Y, Z, and a circle C. Some angles are given, and some points lie on the circle. The question is asking for the measure of arc XZ, denoted as m∠XZ. Wait, actually, the notation m widehat XZ usually refers to the measure of the arc from X to Z. But I need to make sure about that.

First, let me parse the given predicates again. 

We have Circle(C), so there's a circle named C. Points W, X, Y, Z are all on this circle because PointLiesOnCircle(W, Circle(C)), same for X, Z. So W, X, Y, Z are all points on circle C. Then there are two angles mentioned: Angle(W,X,Y) has measure 68 degrees, and Angle(Y,Z,W) has measure 224 degrees. Wait, but angles in a circle... Hmm.

So Angle(W,X,Y) means the angle at point X formed by points W, X, Y. Similarly, Angle(Y,Z,W) is the angle at point Y formed by points Y, Z, W. Let me sketch this mentally. Points W, X, Y, Z are on a circle. The first angle is ∠WXY = 68°, and the second angle is ∠ZYW = 224°? Wait, but angles inside a circle can sometimes relate to arcs. Also, note that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. However, if the angle is greater than 180°, it might be a reflex angle, which could complicate things. 

Wait, the measure of Angle(Y,Z,W) is 224°, which is more than 180°, so that's a reflex angle. That suggests that maybe the angle is formed by extending some lines or considering the larger arc. But how does that fit with the other angle?

Let me think step by step.

First, since all points W, X, Y, Z are on circle C, they lie on the circumference. So the circle has these four points. Now, let's consider the angles given.

Starting with ∠WXY = 68°. Since X is one of the points on the circle, and the angle is formed by connecting W-X-Y. This is an inscribed angle. The intercepted arc would be the arc opposite to the angle, which would be arc WY. Because in an inscribed angle, the vertex is on the circle, and the sides are chords. The intercepted arc is the arc that's not containing the vertex. Wait, but depending on where the points are placed. Alternatively, maybe I should recall that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So if ∠WXY intercepts arc WY, then arc WY would be 2*68°=136°.

Now, the other angle given is ∠ZYW = 224°. Let's analyze that. The angle at Y, formed by points Z, Y, W. Again, since Y is on the circle, this is another inscribed angle. However, 224° is a reflex angle, which is more than 180°, so perhaps this angle intercepts a major arc. Normally, inscribed angles are considered to be less than 180°, but if the angle is reflex, maybe it's measuring the other arc. Wait, but how do we handle that?

Alternatively, maybe the angle isn't an inscribed angle but something else. Wait, but all points are on the circle. Let me visualize. Suppose we have points W, X, Y, Z arranged around the circle. Let me try to imagine their order. For example, suppose the points are placed such that moving around the circle, we go W, X, Y, Z, and back to W. Or maybe different orders. But without knowing the exact configuration, we need to deduce based on the angles.

But let's focus on the angles. First, ∠WXY is 68°, so that's an inscribed angle intercepting arc WY. Therefore, arc WY measures 136°, as above. Then, ∠ZYW is 224°, which seems like a reflex angle. However, inscribed angles typically don't exceed 180°, unless they're considering the reflex arc. Wait, but maybe this is not an inscribed angle. Wait, if the angle is formed by three points on the circle, then it's an inscribed angle. But if the angle is reflex, then maybe the actual angle we want is the non-reflex part? Wait, but angles can't be reflex in standard definitions; the measure of an inscribed angle is always less than 180°, because it's half the measure of the intercepted arc. So if the given angle is 224°, which is reflex, perhaps that's not an inscribed angle. Maybe the angle is formed by extending some chords?

Wait, but the angle is specified as Angle(Y,Z,W). So the vertex is at Y, with segments YZ and YW. So that's an angle at Y between points Z, Y, W. Since Y is on the circle, and Z and W are also on the circle. So this angle is formed by two chords: YZ and YW. Therefore, it's an inscribed angle, but since it's 224°, which is more than 180°, that suggests that the intercepted arc is actually the major arc WZ passing through Y? Wait, but how?

Wait, normally, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. But if the angle is reflex, then maybe the intercepted arc is the rest of the circle. Let me think. Suppose the angle is formed by two chords meeting at Y, so the intercepted arc would be the arc opposite to the angle. But if the angle is reflex, that would mean that the intercepted arc is the major arc. However, the formula still holds: the measure of the inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. But if the angle is reflex, then the intercepted arc would be the major arc. But wait, that can't be, because the maximum inscribed angle would be 180°, corresponding to a semicircle. So perhaps there's confusion here. Maybe the given angle isn't an inscribed angle, but instead is a central angle? No, because the vertex is on the circle. Wait, unless the angle is formed outside the circle, but the points are all on the circle.

Alternatively, maybe the given angle is a central angle. Wait, no, because a central angle has its vertex at the center of the circle. Here, the vertex is at Y, which is on the circle. So that's an inscribed angle. So how can it be 224°? That doesn't align with the usual definition. Unless the angle is measured in the other direction. Wait, maybe the angle is actually the reflex angle, which would correspond to the major arc. But according to the inscribed angle theorem, the angle should be half the measure of the intercepted arc. So if the angle is 224°, then the intercepted arc would be 448°, which is impossible because the total circumference is 360°. So that can't be. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here.

Wait, maybe the angle is not an inscribed angle. Perhaps the angle is formed by intersecting chords, but since all points are on the circle, that's still an inscribed angle. Alternatively, maybe the angle is formed by secants or tangents. Wait, but all points are on the circle, so the sides of the angle are chords. So that's still an inscribed angle. Therefore, the measure of the angle should be half the intercepted arc. But 224° is way too big. So perhaps the given angle is not referring to the standard inscribed angle, but rather the reflex angle. Which would imply that the intercepted arc is the minor arc, but then the angle would be half of that. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Inscribed angle: the angle formed by two chords with the vertex on the circle. The measure of the angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. However, if the angle is drawn such that it opens towards the interior of the circle, then it intercepts the arc that's opposite. If the angle is drawn such that it opens outward, then it would intercept the rest of the circle. But in reality, the angle is determined by the position of the points. So if the angle is reflex, that would mean that the intercepted arc is the major arc. However, the measure of the angle would be half of the measure of that major arc. But since the major arc can't be more than 360°, the angle would be up to 180°, which contradicts the given 224°. Hence, there must be an error in my understanding.

Wait, but maybe the angle is not an inscribed angle. Let me check the given predicates again. It says MeasureOf(Angle(Y,Z,W)) = 224. So the angle at Y between Z and W. Given that all points are on the circle, but maybe the angle is not formed by two chords but by a chord and a tangent? Wait, but there's no mention of tangents. All points are on the circle, so the sides of the angle are chords. Therefore, it's an inscribed angle. Thus, the measure should be half the intercepted arc. So if the angle is 224°, then the intercepted arc would be 448°, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in interpreting the angle.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is not an inscribed angle but a central angle. Wait, but the vertex is on the circle, not the center. So that's not a central angle. Alternatively, maybe the angle is formed by two secant lines that pass through the circle, creating an external angle. Wait, but all points are on the circle, so the angle is formed by two chords. So that brings us back to the original problem.

Alternatively, maybe the given angle is not the inscribed angle but the exterior angle. Wait, for instance, if the angle is formed outside the circle by two secants. But in that case, the formula would be different. The measure of the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. However, in this case, the angle is at Y, which is on the circle. So that's not applicable. 

This suggests that there's a contradiction in the given data, but that's unlikely. So maybe the given angle is not an inscribed angle. Wait, but all points are on the circle. Let me think differently. Perhaps the angle is not formed by chords but by extended lines. For example, if the points are arranged such that the angle is formed by extending certain chords beyond the circle. But that complicates things. 

Alternatively, maybe the measure given is for the reflex angle, which would be the supplement of the actual inscribed angle. For example, if the angle is 224°, then the non-reflex angle would be 360° - 224° = 136°, which could be the inscribed angle. But then the intercepted arc would be 2*136° = 272°, which is a major arc. Wait, but that's possible. Let me check:

Suppose the angle at Y is 224°, which is the reflex angle. But the actual inscribed angle (the smaller angle) would be 360° - 224° = 136°, which is the angle that is formed by the same two chords but on the other side. In that case, the inscribed angle would be 136°, which would correspond to an arc of 272°. But then, how does that fit with the first angle being 68°?

Wait, let's assume that. Let me proceed with that assumption. So the angle at Y (∠ZYW) is a reflex angle of 224°, but the actual inscribed angle (non-reflex) is 136°, which would intercept an arc of 2*136°=272°. So that arc would be the major arc from Z to W passing through Y. But since the points are W, X, Y, Z on the circle, maybe the arrangement is such that moving around the circle, we have points W, X, Y, Z in some order. 

So, if arc WY is 136° (from the first angle), and the arc ZW (major arc) is 272°, then the entire circle is 360°, so adding those arcs together? Wait, but arc WY and arc ZW are overlapping? Let me think again. 

If we have points W, X, Y, Z on the circle. The first angle ∠WXY intercepts arc WY, which is 136°. The second angle ∠ZYW intercepts arc ZW (the major arc), which is 272°. Then, the sum of arcs WY and ZW would depend on the positions. Let me try to find relations between these arcs. 

Alternatively, perhaps the arc from W to Y is 136°, and the arc from Z to W is 272°, but that would mean that the arc from Z to Y would be 272° - 136° = 136°, but that may not hold. This is getting confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle at Y is formed by points Z, Y, W, and since Y is on the circle, the angle is formed by chords YZ and YW. The measure of this angle depends on the arcs it intercepts. If the angle is 224°, which is reflex, then the intercepted arc would be the arc that's opposite, which would be the arc from Z to W that doesn't contain Y. Wait, but if the angle is at Y, then the intercepted arc would be the arc that is opposite, i.e., the arc ZW that doesn't include Y. However, since the angle is reflex, that arc would be the major arc ZW. 

Therefore, the measure of the angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. But if the angle is reflex, then the intercepted arc would be the major arc. However, the formula states that the inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. But if the intercepted arc is the major arc, then the angle would be half of that. So if the angle is 224°, then the intercepted arc would be 224° × 2 = 448°, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that the given angle cannot be an inscribed angle. There must be a different interpretation.

Wait, maybe the angle is not an inscribed angle but an external angle. For example, if the angle is formed by two secants that start at Y and extend beyond the circle. However, since all points are on the circle, the sides of the angle are chords. So that wouldn't be the case. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a typo in the problem, but assuming that the given data is correct, perhaps the angle is indeed a reflex angle, and we need to adjust our thinking. 

Another thought: maybe the given angle is not an inscribed angle but a central angle. Wait, but the vertex is at Y, which is on the circle, not the center. So that's not possible. 

Wait, maybe the angle is formed by two tangents. But since Y is on the circle, a tangent at Y would form a right angle with the radius. But there's no mention of tangents in the problem. 

Hmm. This is tricky. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's assume that the given angle ∠ZYW is 224°, which is a reflex angle. But how can that be? Well, if the angle is formed by two chords YZ and YW, then the angle could be reflex if the points Z and W are positioned such that when you connect them to Y, the angle opens in a way that creates a reflex angle. However, according to the inscribed angle theorem, this should be half the measure of the intercepted arc. 

Wait, but if the angle is reflex, then the intercepted arc would be the rest of the circle. So for example, if the angle at Y is reflex, then the intercepted arc would be the arc that's not included in the angle. Let me recall that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So if the angle is reflex, say θ, then the intercepted arc would be 360° - 2θ? Wait, no. Let me think carefully.

Imagine a circle with points Z and W. If you have an angle at Y, formed by chords YZ and YW. If the angle is acute, it intercepts arc ZW. If the angle is obtuse, it intercepts arc ZW. But if the angle is reflex, it would intercept the other arc. Wait, but how? Let me look for a formula.

Actually, the measure of an inscribed angle is always half the measure of its intercepted arc. But the intercepted arc is the arc that is not containing the angle's vertex. Wait, but if the angle is reflex, then the intercepted arc would be the major arc. So if the angle is 224°, then the intercepted arc would be 224° × 2 = 448°, which is impossible. So this suggests that the given angle is not an inscribed angle. Therefore, I must have made an incorrect assumption earlier.

Perhaps the angle is not formed by two chords but by a chord and a tangent? For example, if one side is a tangent and the other is a chord. Then the measure of the angle would be half the difference of the intercepted arcs. But since there's no mention of tangents, this might not apply.

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves cyclic quadrilaterals. Let's see. If points W, X, Y, Z are on a circle, then they form a cyclic quadrilateral. But I don't know the order of the points. If we assume that the quadrilateral is WXYZ, then the angles could be related. But without knowing the order, it's hard to tell.

Wait, but the angle ∠WXY is given. So points W, X, Y are consecutive on the circle? Not necessarily, but if they are, then the angle at X would be an inscribed angle intercepting arc WY. And similarly for ∠ZYW. 

Assuming that the points are ordered W, X, Y, Z around the circle. Let me try this order. So starting at W, going to X, then Y, then Z, and back to W. In this case, the arc from W to Y would be arc WXY, which is the arc from W to Y passing through X. The measure of ∠WXY would be half the measure of arc WY. So if ∠WXY is 68°, then arc WY is 136°. 

Then, looking at ∠ZYW, which is the angle at Y between Z, Y, W. If the points are ordered W, X, Y, Z, then the angle at Y between Z and W would involve points Z, Y, W. So from Y, drawing chords to Z and W. The intercepted arc would be arc ZW that does not pass through Y. But since the points are ordered W, X, Y, Z, the arc from Z to W that doesn't pass through Y would be the major arc passing through X. So the measure of this arc would be 360° minus the arc from Z to W passing through Y. 

Wait, but the measure of ∠ZYW is given as 224°, which is supposed to be an inscribed angle. So if that angle intercepts the arc ZW (not passing through Y), then the measure of the angle would be half of that arc. So:

Measure of ∠ZYW = (1/2)(measure of arc ZW) → 224 = (1/2)(arc ZW) → arc ZW = 448°, which is impossible. So this can't be. 

Alternative idea: Maybe the angle is formed by extending the chords, making it an external angle. For example, if the angle is outside the circle. But how? If Y is on the circle, then to form an external angle, one of the sides would have to be a tangent. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is formed by two secants, but since Y is on the circle, one of the secants is a tangent. For instance, if one side is a tangent at Y and the other is a secant. But there's no mention of tangents. 

This seems like a dead end. Let me think of another approach. Let's use the fact that the total circumference is 360°, so the sum of all arcs around the circle is 360°. We already have arc WY as 136° from the first angle. Let me denote some variables. Let’s call arc WX as a, arc XY as b, arc YZ as c, and arcZW as d. Since the points are on the circle, the sum a + b + c + d = 360°. 

From the first angle ∠WXY = 68°, which intercepts arc WY. Arc WY would be arc WX + arc XY = a + b. So a + b = 136°.

Now, the second angle ∠ZYW = 224°. Let's think about what this angle intercepts. The angle is at Y, between Z and W. So the intercepted arc would be arc ZW that does not include Y. That arc would be arc ZW passing through X, which is arc ZX + arc XW. Wait, but arc ZW passing through X would be arc Z to X to W. Wait, if points are ordered W, X, Y, Z, then arc ZW passing through X would be arc ZX + arc XW. But arc ZX would be from Z to X, which is arc ZY + arc YX = c + b. And arc XW is a. So the total arc ZW through X would be c + b + a. 

But earlier, we had a + b = 136°, so the arc ZW through X would be 136° + c. 

However, the measure of ∠ZYW is supposed to be half of the intercepted arc. So:

∠ZYW = (1/2)(intercepted arc) → 224 = (1/2)(arc ZW through X) → arc ZW through X = 448°, which is impossible. 

Again, this leads to a contradiction. Therefore, my assumption about the intercepted arc must be wrong. 

Wait, maybe the intercepted arc is the arc that contains Y. But that would be the minor arc ZW. Wait, but if the angle is at Y, then the intercepted arc should be the arc that is opposite to the angle, i.e., not containing Y. So if the angle is at Y, then the intercepted arc is the arc ZW that does not contain Y. But if the points are ordered W, X, Y, Z, then the arc ZW not containing Y is the arc from Z to W through X, which is arc ZX + arc XW = (c + b) + a. Wait, but that was leading to a large number. 

Alternatively, maybe the intercepted arc is the arc from Z to W that passes through Y. But that would be the minor arc ZW, which would be arc ZY + arc YW = c + (a + b) = c + 136°. Then, the measure of the angle would be half of that arc. So:

∠ZYW = (1/2)(arc ZW) → 224 = (1/2)(c + 136) → c + 136 = 448 → c = 448 - 136 = 312°. But that would mean arc ZY is 312°, which is more than the full circle. Impossible. 

This is perplexing. Perhaps there's a miscalculation. Let me re-express the equations. 

Given:

Arc WY = 136° (from first angle).

Total circle: arc WY + arc YZ + arc ZX + arc XW = 360°. Wait, not sure. Let me define the arcs properly.

Assume the points are ordered W, X, Y, Z around the circle. So the arcs between them are:

- From W to X: arc WX = a
- From X to Y: arc XY = b
- From Y to Z: arc YZ = c
- From Z to W: arc ZW = d

Thus, a + b + c + d = 360°.

From the first angle ∠WXY = 68°, which is an inscribed angle intercepting arc WY. Arc WY is arc WX + arc XY = a + b = 136°.

Now, the second angle ∠ZYW is at Y, formed by points Z, Y, W. This angle intercepts arc ZW. Depending on the position, this could be either arc ZW passing through X (which would be a + b + c) or arc ZW passing through Y, but that would be the other arc. Wait, but since the angle is at Y, the intercepted arc is the arc that is opposite, not containing Y. So arc ZW that does not contain Y. If the points are in order W, X, Y, Z, then the arc from Z to W not containing Y would be arc Z to X to W, which is arc ZX + arc XW = arc ZY + arc YX + arc XW = c + b + a. Wait, but arc ZY is c, arc YX is b, arc XW is a. So that total is c + b + a. 

So the measure of ∠ZYW is half of that arc: (a + b + c)/2 = 224°. 

But we know that a + b = 136°, so substituting:

(136 + c)/2 = 224 → 136 + c = 448 → c = 448 - 136 = 312°. 

But this implies that arc YZ (which is c) is 312°, which is impossible since the total circle is 360°, and the remaining arcs a + b + d = 360 - c = 360 - 312 = 48°. So a + b = 136°, which conflicts with a + b + d = 48°, implying that d = 48 - 136 = negative, which is impossible. 

This contradiction suggests that there's an error in assumptions. Perhaps the points are not in the order W, X, Y, Z? Let me consider a different ordering. 

What if the points are arranged as W, Y, X, Z? Let's try that. So the order is W, Y, X, Z. Then the arcs would be:

- arc WY = a
- arc YX = b
- arc XZ = c
- arc ZW = d

Total: a + b + c + d = 360°

For the first angle ∠WXY = 68°. This is the angle at X between W, X, Y. So this angle intercepts arc WY. If the points are W, Y, X, Z, then the arc WY is just arc WY, which is a. So measure of ∠WXY = (1/2)*a = 68° → a = 136°. 

Now, the second angle ∠ZYW is at Y, between Z, Y, W. So the angle at Y formed by points Z, Y, W. The intercepted arc would be arc ZW that does not contain Y. With the order W, Y, X, Z, the arc ZW not containing Y would be arc Z to X to W, which is arc ZX + arc XW. Arc ZX is arc XZ = c, and arc XW is arc X to W, which is arc X to Y to W = b + a. Wait, no. If the order is W, Y, X, Z, then from X to W, it's arc X to Y to W, which is arc XY (b) plus arc YW (a)? No, arc X to W would be arc X to Y to W, which is arc XY (b) + arc YW (a). Wait, but arc YW is from Y to W, which is arc Y to W directly, which would be arc YW. But in this ordering, the arc YW would be the arc from Y to W, which goes through X? Or directly? 

Actually, the arc intercepted by the angle at Y between Z and W would be the arc that is opposite to the angle. Since the angle is at Y, the intercepted arc is the arc ZW that doesn't pass through Y. In this ordering, the arc ZW not containing Y would be arc Z to X to W, which is arc ZX + arc XW. Arc ZX is arc from Z to X, which is arc Z to X directly, which in this order would be arc Z to X, which is arc Z to X, which is part of the circle. Wait, this is getting complicated. 

Maybe I should calculate the measure of the angle ∠ZYW. If the points are in order W, Y, X, Z, then the angle at Y between Z and W would intercept arc ZW that does not pass through Y. So that arc is from Z to W passing through X. The length of this arc is arc ZX + arc XW. Arc ZX is from Z to X, which is arc Z to X directly. In this case, the arc from Z to X is arc Z to X, which is arc Z to X, which would be arc Z to X = arc Z to X, which is part of the circle. Let me denote arc Z to X as e, arc X to W as f. Wait, this is getting too vague. 

Alternatively, since we know that arc WY is 136° (from the first angle), and we need to find arc XZ, which is the arc from X to Z. But the question asks for m∠XZ, which is likely the measure of arc XZ. Wait, the question says "Find m widehat XZ", which is the measure of arc XZ. 

But given the confusion with the other angle, maybe we can find arc XZ. Let's try to express everything in terms of known quantities.

From the first angle, arc WY = 136°. 

Let me consider the second angle ∠ZYW = 224°. Assuming it's an inscribed angle, which intercepts arc ZW. But since this leads to contradictions, maybe there's another way. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle ∠ZYW is not an inscribed angle but a central angle. But the vertex is at Y, which is on the circle, so that's not possible. 

Wait, but what if the angle is formed by two chords, but one of them is extended? Like, if the angle is formed by extending a chord beyond Y, but that would change the angle's measure. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's consider that the sum of the arcs around the circle is 360°. We know arc WY is 136°. If I can find other arcs, maybe I can find arc XZ. 

But I need more information. The second angle is 224°, which might relate to another arc. Let me assume that the angle ∠ZYW is actually the reflex angle, and thus its non-reflex counterpart is 360° - 224° = 136°, which would be the inscribed angle. So the inscribed angle is 136°, which would intercept an arc of 272°. 

So if ∠ZYW is a reflex angle of 224°, then the actual inscribed angle is 136°, which would intercept arc ZW of 272°. 

So arc ZW is 272°. 

Now, since the total circle is 360°, the arc WY is 136°, and arc ZW is 272°. These arcs overlap. Let me visualize: arc WY is 136°, and arc ZW is 272°. If I add these, it's 136 + 272 = 408°, which is more than 360°, so they must overlap. 

To find arc XZ, let's consider the relationship between these arcs. 

If arc ZW is 272°, then the arc from Z to W is 272°, which would mean that the arc from W to Z is 272°, but since the total circle is 360°, the arc from Z to W in the other direction is 360 - 272 = 88°. 

Now, arc WY is 136°, and arc ZW is 272°. Let's try to find arc XZ. 

Assume that the points are arranged such that arc WY is 136°, and arc ZW is 272°. Let's consider the position of X. 

If we imagine the circle with points W and Z such that arc ZW is 272°, then the arc from Z to W going the short way is 88°. Now, arc WY is 136°, so from W to Y is 136°. 

If we can find the relationship between these arcs to locate X and Y. 

Assume that X is somewhere on the circle. Let's say the arc from W to X is a, and from X to Y is b, such that a + b = 136°. 

Also, the arc from Z to W is 272°, so the arc from Z to W going the long way is 272°, which implies that the arc from Z to W going the short way is 88°. 

If we can relate these arcs to find arc XZ. 

Let me think about the entire circle. The arc from Z to W is 272°, and arc from W to Y is 136°. If we can find the arc from Y to Z, that would help. 

The total circle is 360°, so arc ZW (long way) is 272°, and arc WY is 136°. Let me try to find the arc from Y to Z. 

Assuming that the arc from Z to W is 272°, and the arc from W to Y is 16°, then the arc from Y to Z would be 272° - 136° = 136°? No, that doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, the arc from Z to W is 272°, and the arc from W to Y is 136°. If these arcs share a common endpoint, then the arc from Z to Y would be arc Z to W (272°) minus arc W to Y (136°), but that depends on the direction. 

This is too vague. Let me try to draw it. 

Imagine a circle with points W and Z such that the arc from Z to W is 272°. This means that the shorter arc from Z to W is 88°. Now, the arc from W to Y is 136°, so if I add these two arcs, the total would be 88° + 136° = 224°, which is the measure of the angle given. Wait, but the angle at Y was 224°, which is the same as this sum. 

Ah! Wait, if the arc from Z to W is 272°, and the arc from W to Y is 136°, then the angle at Y formed by Z, Y, W would be half the difference of the intercepted arcs? No, but if the angle is formed by two chords, it's half the measure of the intercepted arc. But if the intercepted arc is 272°, then the angle would be 136°, but the given angle is 224°. 

Wait, but if the angle is formed by two chords, and the intercepted arc is 272°, then the angle would be half of that, which is 136°, but the given angle is 224°. This doesn't match. 

However, if the angle is formed by extending the chords, creating an external angle, then the measure would be half the difference of the intercepted arcs. For example, if the angle is formed by two secants, then the measure is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. 

Wait, but in this case, if the angle is formed at Y, and the two sides are YZ and YW, then it's an inscribed angle if Y is on the circle. But if the angle is formed by two secants, then it would be an external angle. 

Wait, but if Y is on the circle, then one of the sides is a tangent or a secant. If both sides are secants, then it's an external angle. For example, if you have two secants from Y, intersecting the circle at Z and W. Then the measure of the angle would be half the difference of the intercepted arcs. 

Yes! This might be the key. Let me recall the formula: the measure of an angle formed by two secants intersecting at a point on the circle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Wait, no, if the point is on the circle, then it's an inscribed angle. But if the point is outside the circle, it's an external angle. 

Wait, here's the correct formula: If two secants intersect at a point outside the circle, the measure of the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. If the point is on the circle, then it's an inscribed angle, which is half the intercepted arc. But if the point is inside the circle, it's half the sum of the intercepted arcs. 

But in this case, the point Y is on the circle. So if the angle is formed by two secants from Y, then it's an inscribed angle. But if the angle is formed by a secant and a tangent, it's different. 

Wait, but in our case, both sides are secants, so it's an inscribed angle. But this leads to the previous contradiction. 

However, if the angle is formed by a secant and a tangent, then the measure is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. But there's no mention of tangents. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is formed by two tangents, but since Y is on the circle, one of the sides would be a tangent at Y, making it a tangent and a secant. 

Let me try this scenario: Assume that one side of the angle at Y is a tangent at Y, and the other side is a secant YW. Then, the measure of the angle would be half the difference of the intercepted arcs. 

But the problem states that all points are on the circle, so the tangent at Y would be a line touching the circle at Y. If one side of the angle is this tangent, and the other is a secant YW, then the angle would be formed by the tangent and the secant. 

The formula for this case is: the measure of the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Specifically, it's half the difference between the intercepted arc and the arc that's opposite. 

But since one side is a tangent, the intercepted arc would be the arc between the point of tangency and the secant. 

But in this case, the tangent is at Y, and the secant is YW. So the angle between the tangent and the secant would be half the measure of the arc that is intercepted by the secant and the tangent. 

Wait, the formula is: if a tangent and a secant meet at a point on the circle, the measure of the angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. 

Wait, let me confirm. If there's a tangent at Y and a secant from Y passing through W, then the angle between them is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc. The intercepted arc would be the arc from Y to W, not containing the tangent. Wait, but the tangent at Y would touch the circle only at Y, so the angle between the tangent and the secant YW would be equal to half the measure of the arc from Y to W that is opposite to the angle. 

But this is similar to the inscribed angle. 

Wait, in this case, the angle between the tangent and the secant would be equal to half the measure of the arc that is intercepted by the secant. For example, if the secant goes from Y to W, then the angle between the tangent and the secant would be half the measure of arc YW. 

But in this case, the given angle is 224°, which would mean that the arc YW is 448°, which is impossible. 

This is not working. 

I think I've exhausted all possibilities, and each time I hit a contradiction. Perhaps the initial assumption that the angle is an inscribed angle is wrong, and the given angle is actually an external angle formed by two secants, but with the vertex on the circle. 

Wait, let's try this: if the angle is formed by two secants that intersect at Y on the circle, then the measure of the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. 

Wait, no, that formula applies when the intersection is outside the circle. If the intersection is on the circle, then it's an inscribed angle. 

Wait, I'm confused. Let me refer to the standard theorems. 

The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. 

The measure of an angle formed by two secants intersecting outside the circle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. 

The measure of an angle formed by two secants intersecting inside the circle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. 

But if the angle is formed at a point on the circle, it's an inscribed angle, hence half the intercepted arc. 

But in this case, the given angle is 224°, which is greater than 180°, suggesting it's a reflex angle, which would require the intercepted arc to be greater than 360°, which is impossible. 

This suggests that there's a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps a misinterpretation of the angle. 

Wait, the angle given is MeasureOf(Angle(B,W,E)) = 224. Wait, wait! Wait, in the original problem, the second angle is written as MeasureOf(Angle(B,W,E)) = 224. Wait, did I read it correctly? Let me check. 

Original predicates: 
MeasureOf(Angle(B,W,E)) = 224

Wait, the user wrote: 

"MeasureOf(Angle(B,W,E)) = 224"

Wait, but in the initial problem statement, the points are W, X, Y, Z. Where did B and E come from? Did I misread it? Let me go back.

Looking back at the user's input:

The given predicates include:
Angle(W,X,Y)
Angle(Y,Z,W)
MeasureOf(Angle(W,X,Y)) = 68
MeasureOf(Angle(B,W,E)) = 224

Wait, this is critical. Earlier, I assumed that the second angle was Angle(Y,Z,W), but the user wrote MeasureOf(Angle(B,W,E)) = 224. This changes everything!

Oh no! I must have misread the angle. Let me recheck. 

The user said:

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC PREDICATES:
Circle(C)
Point(W)
Point(X)
Point(Y)
Point(Z)
Angle(W,X,Y)
Angle(Y,Z,W)
MeasureOf(Angle(W,X,Y)) = 68
MeasureOf(Angle(B,W,E)) = 224
PointLiesOnCircle(W, Circle(C))
PointLiesOnCircle(X, Circle(C))
PointLiesOnCircle(Z, Circle(C))"

Wait, so there are two angles mentioned: Angle(W,X,Y) and Angle(Y,Z,W), but the measure given is for Angle(B,W,E). Wait, this is conflicting. Let me re-read the problem carefully.

The user wrote:

"MeasureOf(Angle(B,W,E)) = 224"

But the points mentioned are W, X, Y, Z. Where do B and E come from? This suggests that there are more points, but they were not listed. This indicates a possible error in the problem statement, or perhaps a typo. 

Wait, the user might have intended to write Angle(Y,Z,W) = 224°, but mistakenly wrote B and E instead of Y and Z. Let me check the original input again.

Looking back at the user's message:

The user wrote:

"Angle(W,X,Y)
Angle(Y,Z,W)
MeasureOf(Angle(W,X,Y)) = 68
MeasureOf(Angle(B,W,E)) = 224"

Ah! So the second angle is Angle(B,W,E), but the points mentioned are W, X, Y, Z. This suggests that B and E are other points not previously mentioned. This complicates things, as we don't have information about B and E. 

But this is a problem, because
