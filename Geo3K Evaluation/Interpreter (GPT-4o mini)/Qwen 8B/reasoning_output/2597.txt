MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have an equilateral pentagon PQRST inscribed in a circle U. We need to find the measure of arc QR, denoted as m∠QR. Wait, actually, the question says m widehat QR, which I think refers to the measure of the arc QR, not the angle at point Q. Hmm, but sometimes people use notation like ∠QRT to mean the angle, but here it's written as m widehat QR, so probably the arc measure.

First, since the pentagon is equilateral, all its sides are equal. But wait, in a regular pentagon, all sides and angles are equal, but here it's just called equilateral. Wait, does an equilateral pentagon mean all sides are equal? Yes, typically equilateral means all sides are equal, even if it's not regular. However, since it's inscribed in a circle, maybe there's some relation between the arcs?

In a cyclic polygon (one inscribed in a circle), the length of each side relates to the subtended arc. For a regular polygon, each arc would be equal because of symmetry. But in an equilateral cyclic pentagon, even though the sides are equal, the arcs might not necessarily be equal unless it's regular. Wait, but in a circle, if two chords are equal, then their subtended arcs are equal. Since all sides are equal chords, their corresponding arcs should be equal. Therefore, each arc between consecutive vertices would be equal. 

Wait, but a pentagon has five sides. If all arcs are equal, then each arc would be 360 degrees divided by 5, which is 72 degrees. But wait, that would make the total circumference 5*72=360, which works. But hold on, this assumes that the pentagon is regular. But the problem states it's equilateral, not necessarily regular. However, since it's inscribed in a circle, can an equilateral cyclic pentagon have unequal arcs?

Wait, no. Because in a circle, if two chords are congruent, their arcs are congruent. Since all sides of the pentagon are congruent (equilateral), each chord PQ, QR, RS, ST, TP are congruent. Therefore, their subtended arcs must be congruent. Hence, each arc between consecutive points is equal. Thus, each arc measures 360/5 = 72 degrees. Therefore, the arc QR would be 72 degrees. That would make the measure of arc QR equal to 72°, so the answer is B.

But wait, let me double-check. Suppose the pentagon is equilateral but not regular. Is it possible for the arcs to be different? Let me think. Suppose the chords are all equal, so their arcs must be equal. Because in a circle, congruent chords subtend congruent arcs. Therefore, regardless of the order, if all sides are equal chords, then all arcs between consecutive vertices must be equal. Therefore, the arc QR is 72°, making the answer B.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the central angle over arc QR. Since each arc is 72°, then yes, the measure is 72. So the answer should be B.
