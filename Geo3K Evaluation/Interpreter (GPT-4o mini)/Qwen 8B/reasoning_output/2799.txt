MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, the question says that chords AC and DF are equidistant from the center. The radius of circle G is 26, and we need to find the length of AC. The answer choices are A. 5, B. 10, C. 13, D. 48. 

First, I need to recall some circle theorems. I remember that if two chords are equidistant from the center of a circle, they must be congruent. Wait, is that right? Let me think. Yes, because the distance from the center to a chord relates to its length. The closer a chord is to the center, the longer it is. So if two chords are equidistant from the center, they should have the same length. Therefore, AC and DF are congruent. But wait, the problem mentions DF, but there's no mention of DF in the given predicates except maybe points D and F? Let me check the predicates again.

Looking back at the given predicates: Points D, E, F, G are mentioned. There's a line ED and an arc ABC. Hmm, but the main thing here is that chords AC and DF are equidistant from the center. Since the radius is given as 26 for circle G, but I need to confirm if AC is part of circle G. Wait, the problem states that the radius of ⊙G is 26. So circle G has radius 26. Are points A, C, D, F on circle G? Because otherwise, how would their distances from the center relate to the radius?

Wait, the problem mentions Circle(A), so maybe point A is the center? Or perhaps there's confusion here. Wait, the predicates are a bit confusing. Let me parse them again. The given predicates are:

- Circle(A): So point A is a circle? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe it's a typo. Maybe it's supposed to be Circle with center A? Or maybe the circle is named G? Wait, looking at the original question again, it says "the radius of ⊙G is 26". So circle G has radius 26. Then the other points like A, B, C, D, E, F, G are points. So maybe the circle is centered at G? Or maybe G is a point on the circle?

This is confusing. Let me try to clarify. The problem says "Chords AC and DF are equidistant from the center." The center of the circle must be a point, probably one of the given points. Wait, the circle is called ⊙G, so G is the center? Because usually, the symbol ⊙ denotes a circle, and the letter after it is the center. For example, ⊙G would mean a circle with center G. So if that's the case, then the center is point G. So the radius of circle G is 26, so the distance from G to any point on the circle is 26.

Now, chords AC and DF are equidistant from the center (which is G). So the distance from the center G to chord AC is equal to the distance from G to chord DF. And since they are equidistant, their lengths must be equal. So AC = DF. But the problem asks for AC. However, without knowing more about DF or other elements, how do we find AC?

But maybe there's more information in the given predicates. Let's look again. The predicates include Line(A,B), Line(A,C), Line(A,E), Line(E,D), and Arc(A,B,C). Also, there are points A, B, C, D, E, F, G. 

So, perhaps the circle G has points A, B, C, D, E, F? Let me try to visualize this. If there's an arc A, B, C, that suggests that points A, B, C lie on a circle. Since there's an arc AB with endpoints A and C, passing through B. So maybe the circle in question is the one with center G? So points A, B, C, D, E, F are all on circle G. 

Let me consider that. If AC is a chord of circle G, then its length depends on its distance from the center. Similarly for DF. Since they're equidistant from the center, their lengths are equal. But how do we find the length of AC?

We know the radius is 26. If we can find the distance from the center G to chord AC, then we can use the formula for the length of a chord: length = 2√(r² - d²), where r is the radius and d is the distance from the center to the chord. 

But how do we find d? Unless there's another piece of information. Wait, maybe we can find d using other parts of the diagram. Let's see the given lines: Line(A,B), Line(A,C), Line(A,E), Line(E,D). So point A is connected to B, C, E. Then E is connected to D. Also, there's an arc A,B,C. So maybe the arc ABC is part of the circle. 

Assuming that points A, B, C are on circle G. So line AC is a chord of the circle. Now, if we can figure out the distance from G to chord AC, then we can compute AC. But how?

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to find the perpendicular distance from the center G to chord AC. Suppose we can find that distance, say 'd', then AC = 2√(26² - d²).

But how do we find 'd'? Perhaps there's something about the position of the chords relative to other lines or points. For instance, maybe the lines from A to B, A to C, etc., give us some info about the triangle or other chords.

Wait, but without knowing where G is located, it's hard to tell. Is G the center? The problem says "the radius of ⊙G is 26", so yes, G is the center. Therefore, the distance from G to chord AC is the perpendicular distance. 

But how do we find that distance? Maybe we can find coordinates. Let me try coordinate geometry. Let's assign coordinates to the points. Let’s assume G is at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, the radius is 26. 

Suppose point A is somewhere on the circle. Let's say A is at (x, y), such that x² + y² = 26². Then, chord AC connects A to C, another point on the circle. The distance from G to chord AC is the length of the perpendicular from G to AC. 

But unless we know more about the positions of A and C, it's difficult to calculate. However, maybe there's another clue. The problem mentions that chords AC and DF are equidistant from the center. So DF is also a chord of the circle, and since it's equidistant from G, it has the same length as AC. But how does DF relate to other points?

Looking at the given predicates, there's a line ED. So point E is connected to D. Also, there's an arc A,B,C. So maybe points A, B, C are arranged such that arc ABC is part of the circle. Also, line AE exists. So point E is connected to A. 

Perhaps there's a relationship between these lines. For example, if line AE intersects with other lines. But without more information, it's challenging. 

Wait, maybe the key lies in recognizing that if two chords are equidistant from the center, then they are congruent. Therefore, AC = DF. But since we don't know anything about DF, maybe there's another way. Alternatively, maybe DF is another chord whose distance from G is the same as AC, allowing us to set up equations. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves right triangles. For example, if we draw a perpendicular from G to AC, forming a right triangle with half of AC as one leg and the distance d as the other leg. 

But again, without knowing d, we can’t proceed numerically. Wait, could there be another chord mentioned that allows us to find d? For instance, if there's another chord with known distance or length. 

Wait, maybe the arcs and lines given can help. For example, the arc ABC implies that points A, B, C are on the circle, and the arc goes from A to C via B. So the central angle over arc ABC would be angle AGC. If we can find that angle, then we could compute the length of AC. 

But how? Without knowing the measure of the arc or any angles, this seems tricky. 

Wait, maybe there's a right triangle involved. For example, if line AE is drawn, and E is connected to D. Maybe there's a right angle somewhere. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a property that if two chords are equidistant from the center, then they are congruent, and thus AC equals DF. But since we don't know DF's length, this seems unhelpful. 

Wait, but maybe DF is a diameter? No, because if DF were a diameter, its distance from the center would be zero, which would make AC also a diameter. But then AC would be 2*radius=52, which isn't among the options. So that's not helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe DF is a different chord, and through some relations, we can find its distance. But without more data, I'm stuck. 

Wait, maybe the key is that the radius is 26, and the answer is one of the options. Let me consider possible lengths of chords. For example, if the distance from the center to the chord is 10, then the length would be 2*sqrt(26^2 - 10^2)= 2*sqrt(676 - 100)= 2*sqrt(576)=2*24=48. Which is option D. But why would the distance be 10? 

Alternatively, if the distance is 13, then sqrt(26^2 -13^2)=sqrt(676 - 169)=sqrt(507)=approx 22.5, so length is ~45. Not matching the options. Wait, but 26^2 - d^2 needs to be a perfect square. Let me check each option. 

For example, suppose AC is 10. Then (AC)/2 is 5. Then d = sqrt(r^2 - (AC/2)^2) = sqrt(26^2 - 5^2) = sqrt(676 -25)=sqrt(651). Not a whole number. 

If AC is 26, then it's a diameter, so length is 52, not in options. 

If AC is 24, then d=sqrt(26^2 -12^2)=sqrt(676-144)=sqrt(532)=~23.06. Not helpful. 

Wait, earlier thought: if d=10, then AC=48. That's option D. But how do I justify that d=10?

Alternatively, maybe there's a right triangle formed with the radius. For instance, if the distance from G to AC is 10, then AC=48. But how do I know that distance is 10? 

Wait, maybe there's a way to infer the distance from the given lines. For example, if line AE is drawn, and E is connected to D, forming line ED. Maybe ED is perpendicular to AC? Or something like that. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a midpoint. If the distance from the center to the chord is d, then the midpoint of the chord is at distance d from the center. If we can find that midpoint, then we can find d. 

But without specific information about the positions of the points, this is still unclear. 

Wait, perhaps the arc ABC is a semicircle? If so, then the central angle would be 180 degrees, making AC a diameter. But that would make AC=52, which isn't an option. 

Alternatively, maybe the arc ABC is a quarter-circle, making the central angle 90 degrees. Then AC would be the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with legs equal to the radius. Wait, no. If the central angle is θ, then the length of chord AC is 2r sin(θ/2). For example, if θ=60 degrees, AC would be 2*26*sin(30°)=26. Not in options. 

Hmm. This approach isn't working. Let me go back. 

Since the chords AC and DF are equidistant from the center, they must be congruent. Therefore, AC = DF. But since the radius is 26, maybe DF is a known chord. Wait, but how? 

Wait, maybe DF is a vertical or horizontal line? Or maybe there's a relation between DF and other lines. Given that there's a line ED, which connects E to D. If E is a point on the circle, and D is another point, maybe ED is perpendicular to DF or something. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves multiple chords and their distances. For example, if we can find the distance from G to DF, then AC would have the same distance. But without knowing DF's position, this is difficult. 

Wait, perhaps there's an implied right triangle. For example, if line AE is perpendicular to DF, and ED is part of the diagram. But again, without visual, this is guesswork. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is 10, which would imply that d= sqrt(26² - (10/2)²) = sqrt(676 - 25) = sqrt(651) ≈ 25.5, which isn't helpful. But if the answer is 48, then d= sqrt(26² - (48/2)²) = sqrt(676 - 576) = sqrt(100) = 10. So the distance from the center to the chord AC is 10 units. 

But how do we know that distance is 10? Maybe there's a reason that the distance is 10. Like, if another chord is mentioned with a known distance. 

Wait, the problem mentions that the radius is 26, and the answer choices include 48. So if the distance from the center to AC is 10, then AC is 48. But how do I connect that to the given predicates? 

Maybe there's a right triangle involving the radius and the distance. For example, if the distance from G to AC is 10, then the length of AC is 48. But how to justify that the distance is 10. 

Wait, maybe the distance from G to AC is equal to the length of another segment in the diagram. For example, if there's a segment from G to a point that's 10 units long. 

But without more information, this is just speculation. However, since 48 is an option and fits with the calculation if d=10, and since the problem gives a radius of 26, which is a common Pythagorean triple with 10 and 24 (since 10-24-26 is a Pythagorean triple), this suggests that the distance from the center to the chord is 10, leading to AC being 48. 

Therefore, the answer is D. 48.
