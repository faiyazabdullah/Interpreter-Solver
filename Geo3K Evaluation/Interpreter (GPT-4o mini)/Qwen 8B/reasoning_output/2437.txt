Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the measure of angle VXW, and the answer choices are A. 25, B. 65, C. 115, D. 180. Since there's an image mentioned but it's not available, I'll have to rely on standard geometric problems that often involve finding angles based on given predicates. 

First, I need to consider common scenarios where such an angle might appear. Common possibilities include triangles, intersecting lines, or maybe even cyclic quadrilaterals. Let me think about typical setups. For example, if points V, X, W are part of a triangle, maybe with some given angles or side lengths. Alternatively, if there are parallel lines or transversals involved, leading to corresponding or alternate interior angles. Another thought: if point X is the intersection of two lines, forming vertical angles or supplementary angles.

Wait, since the answer options include 25, 65, 115, and 180, these numbers suggest that maybe we're dealing with complementary or supplementary angles. For instance, 90 degrees isn't an option, so perhaps the angles are part of a triangle with other known angles. Let's explore different cases.

Case 1: Suppose angle VXW is part of a triangle. If we know two other angles, we could find the third. But without specific info, this is too vague. Maybe there's a right angle involved? If one angle is 90°, then others would add up accordingly. However, none of the options are 90°, so maybe not directly.

Case 2: If there are parallel lines cut by a transversal. For example, if VX is parallel to another line, creating corresponding angles. But again, without knowing which lines are parallel, it's hard to tell.

Case 3: Maybe an isosceles triangle. If two sides are equal, base angles are equal. But again, missing specifics.

Alternatively, think about a straight line. If points V, X, W are colinear, then angle VXW would be 180°, which is option D. But that seems too straightforward. However, if they aren't colinear, then it's something else.

Another possibility: Inscribed angles in a circle. For example, if points V, X, W lie on a circle, and angle VXW is an inscribed angle subtending an arc. The measure of the inscribed angle would be half the measure of the central angle. But again, without knowing arcs or other angles, it's tricky.

Wait, maybe there's a diagram involving a triangle with an exterior angle. For instance, the exterior angle equals the sum of the remote interior angles. If angle VXW is an exterior angle, then maybe it's equal to the sum of two other angles. Suppose those angles were 25° and 40°, making the exterior angle 65°, which is option B. Or if the remote angles were 50° and 65°, the exterior angle would be 115°, option C. 

But how do I decide? Without the image, I have to make assumptions based on common problems. Let me think of another angle. Sometimes, vertical angles are equal. If angle VXW is vertical to another angle, say 115°, then that would be the answer. Or if it's a linear pair with another angle, like 65°, making them supplementary. 

Alternatively, considering triangle angle sums. If there's a triangle with angles adding to 180°, and angle VXW is one of them. For example, if two angles are 25° and 65°, the third would be 90°, but that doesn't match. Wait, but if the triangle has angles 25°, 65°, and 90°, then maybe angle VXW is the right angle? But 90° isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, another idea: maybe it's an isosceles triangle with a vertex angle. Suppose the triangle has two equal angles, each being 57.5°, but that's not matching the options either. Not helpful.

Let me try another approach. Think of the answer choices. Option D is 180°, which would mean the points are colinear. That's simple. If VXW is a straight line, then angle at X would be 180°, making D the answer. But why would that be the case? Unless the diagram shows three points on a straight line. However, without seeing the image, this is speculative.

Alternatively, if angle VXW is formed by two lines intersecting, and there's a given angle that's supplementary. Like, if one angle is 65°, then its supplement is 115°, which is option C. Or if there's a right angle, then 90°, but that's not listed.

Wait, maybe it's a triangle with one angle given. For example, suppose angle at V is 25°, angle at W is 65°, then angle at X would be 90°, but again, not matching. Or if angle at X is an external angle. For instance, if two angles inside the triangle are 25° and 65°, then the external angle at X would be 25+65=90°, still not matching.

Alternatively, if there's a triangle with angles 25°, 25°, and 130°, then the third angle is 130°, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, another scenario: maybe the angle is part of a parallelogram. In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, and consecutive angles are supplementary. So if one angle is 65°, the adjacent angle would be 180-65=115°, which is option C. So if angle VXW is one of those adjacent angles, then 115° would be the answer. This fits option C.

Alternatively, if there's a transversal cutting through two parallel lines, creating corresponding angles. Suppose one angle is 65°, then the corresponding angle would also be 65°, which is option B. Or if it's an alternate interior angle, same thing.

But how to choose between B and C? Well, without more info, it's hard. However, considering that 115° is a common supplementary angle to 65°, and 65° is a common acute angle, it's possible that depending on the configuration. But since the answer options are limited, and if the problem involves a triangle with angles that add up to 180°, maybe 25 + 65 = 90, leaving the third angle as 90°, which is not an option. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the angle is an exterior angle of a triangle. If the two remote interior angles are 25° and 65°, then the exterior angle would be 90°, again not matching. But if the remote angles are 25° and 40°, then the exterior angle would be 65°, which is option B. 

But how to figure out which scenario applies here? Given that the answer choices are A-D, and the options include 25, 65, 115, 180. If I had to guess based on common problems, maybe the angle is an exterior angle in a triangle with remote angles adding to 65°, making the exterior angle 65°, hence B. Or if it's a supplementary angle to 65°, making it 115°, option C. 

Since I don't have the image, I need to consider which is more likely. In many standardized tests, angles like 65° and 115° are common in problems involving parallel lines or triangles. Also, 115° is supplementary to 65°, which could come from a transversal or a triangle. 

Alternatively, if angle VXW is a vertical angle with another angle measuring 115°, then that would be the answer. Or if it's a linear pair with another angle of 65°, making it 115°. 

Given that, I think the most probable answers are B or C. To decide, maybe consider that 115° is more common in certain configurations, like supplementary angles. For example, if two lines intersect, forming vertical angles, and one of them is 115°, then the opposite angle is also 115°, while the adjacent angles are 65°, which would be option B. 

So, if angle VXW is one of those vertical angles, then answer C. If it's the adjacent angle, then answer B. Without seeing the diagram, it's ambiguous, but given that 115° is a common supplementary angle, and sometimes questions use that, I'll go with option C. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the angle was part of a triangle with angles adding up, maybe 25°, 65°, and 90°, but again, 90° isn't an option. 

Wait, another thought: if the diagram includes a triangle with a right angle, and angle VXW is one of the non-right angles. Suppose the right angle is at X, making angles at V and W sum to 90°. If one of them is 25°, the other is 65°, so angle VXW could be either 25° or 65°, options A or B. But again, depends on labeling. 

Hmm, this is really challenging without the image. But given the options, and trying to pick the most plausible, I think the answer is either B or C. Considering that 115° is supplementary to 65°, and often appears in problems with parallel lines and transversals, I'll lean towards option C, 115°, as the answer.
