MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. The question says that the measure of angle 4 is 101 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle 6. Since I don't have the image, I'll have to make some assumptions based on common geometric configurations where angles like 4 and 6 might appear.

First, angles labeled 4 and 6 could be part of a transversal intersecting two lines, maybe parallel lines? Because when a transversal crosses parallel lines, corresponding angles are equal, alternate interior angles are equal, and consecutive interior angles are supplementary. Alternatively, they could be angles in a triangle or around a point.

Wait, another possibility is that these angles are vertical angles, but vertical angles are always equal. But since angle 4 is 101, if angle 6 were vertical, it would also be 101, so that would mean answer D. But looking at the options, D is 101, but maybe there's more to it.

Alternatively, if angles 4 and 6 are supplementary, like consecutive interior angles formed by a transversal, then their sum would be 180. So if angle 4 is 101, angle 6 would be 180 - 101 = 79. That would make answer B. 

But how do I know if they're supplementary? Let me think. If the lines are parallel, then consecutive interior angles add up to 180. So if angle 4 and angle 6 are consecutive interior angles, then yes. But without seeing the diagram, it's hard to tell. However, given the answer choices, 79 is one of them (option B). Another thought: maybe they are same-side exterior angles, which would also be supplementary. Or perhaps they are remote interior angles in a triangle?

Wait, another scenario: if angles 4 and 6 are in a triangle. For example, if angle 4 is one angle of a triangle, and angle 6 is another, but then we'd need more info. But since only one angle is given, that seems unlikely.

Another possibility: angles 4 and 6 could be part of a straight line, making them supplementary. If angle 4 is 101, then angle 6 would be 79. That fits with answer B again.

Alternatively, if angles 4 and 6 are vertical angles, then they'd be equal, leading to answer D. But why would the answer be D? Unless there's something else. Wait, maybe angle 4 and angle 6 are not directly related but are parts of different structures. Like, angle 4 could be an angle in a triangle, and angle 6 could be an exterior angle. Then, the exterior angle equals the sum of the remote interior angles. But unless we know other angles, that's tricky.

But considering standard problems, when two angles are formed by a transversal across parallel lines, consecutive interior angles are supplementary. So if angle 4 and angle 6 are such, then 101 + x = 180 â†’ x=79. Which is option B. So that seems plausible. Also, since the answer choices include 79 (B) and 101 (D), but if the answer was D, then maybe they are vertical angles. But why would the problem be straightforward? Maybe the diagram shows parallel lines with a transversal, making angles 4 and 6 supplementary. Hence, answer B.

So, I think the answer is B. 79 degrees.
