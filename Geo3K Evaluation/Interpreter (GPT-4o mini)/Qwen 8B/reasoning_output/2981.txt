Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. So, we need to find the area of a rhombus given some conditions. Let me start by recalling what I know about rhombuses. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and opposite sides are parallel. Also, the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. Wait, but here they mention something about perpendicular lines, so maybe that's related to the diagonals?

The given predicates are: Rhombus(A, B, C, D), which means the figure ABCD is a rhombus. Then there's Equals(LengthOf(Line(B, D)), 12) – so the length of diagonal BD is 12 units. Next, Equals(LengthOf(Line(C, A)), 22) – that's the length of diagonal CA, which would be another diagonal. And Perpendicular(Line(B, D), Line(C, A)) – so the two diagonals are perpendicular to each other. 

Wait a second, in a rhombus, the diagonals are always perpendicular. So that's a property we can use here. But how does that help us find the area? Oh! Right, the area of a rhombus can be calculated if we know the lengths of the diagonals. The formula is (d1 * d2)/2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, this formula applies directly. 

So, given that one diagonal is 12 and the other is 22, plugging those into the formula gives (12 * 22)/2. Let me compute that. 12 times 22 is 264, divided by 2 is 132. Hmm, looking at the answer choices, option C is 132. That seems straightforward. 

But wait, let me double-check. Are the diagonals indeed BD and CA? In a rhombus, the diagonals connect opposite vertices. So points B and D are connected by one diagonal, and points C and A by the other. So yes, those are the diagonals. And since they're perpendicular, the area formula holds. 

Another way to think about it: the area can also be calculated as base * height, but without knowing the side length or the height, that might not be helpful here. Alternatively, since all sides are equal, but again, the diagonals being perpendicular gives us the easiest path. 

Let me confirm once more. The problem states that the diagonals are perpendicular, which is a defining characteristic of a rhombus. Therefore, using the formula with the given diagonals should give the correct area. 

Calculating again: 12 multiplied by 22 equals 264, divide by 2 gives 132. So the area is 132. Looking at the options, that's choice C. So the answer should be C.
