Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. 

Starting with the first predicate: Triangle(A, C, B). So, points A, C, and B form a triangle. Then there's a right angle at Angle(A, C, B), which means triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at point C. That's important because in a right-angled triangle, the Pythagorean theorem applies. 

Next, looking at the length equalities. The first one says Equals(LengthOf(Line(A, D)), LengthOf(Line(D, B))). So AD equals DB. That suggests that D is a midpoint? Or maybe part of some isosceles triangle? Wait, but where is D located? Since we have Line(A, D) and Line(D, B), D must be connected to both A and B. But since ABC is a triangle, maybe D is somewhere along AB or another line?

Then there's Equals(LengthOf(Line(A, C)), 3x + 11). So AC = 3x + 11. Also, Equals(LengthOf(Line(C, B)), 2y - 1). CB = 2y - 1. Another equality: Equals(LengthOf(Line(C, E)), LengthOf(Line(E, B))). So CE = EB, implying E is the midpoint of CB? Because if CE equals EB, then E divides CB into two equal parts. 

Also, Equals(LengthOf(Line(B, A)), 5x - 8). BA is the hypotenuse of triangle ABC since it's a right triangle at C. So BA should be the hypotenuse. Therefore, BA² = AC² + CB². Let me note that down. 

Additionally, Equals(LengthOf(Line(C, A)), 4y - 7). Wait, CA is the same as AC, so that would mean AC = 4y - 7. But earlier, AC was given as 3x + 11. Therefore, 3x + 11 = 4y - 7. That's one equation relating x and y.

Another predicate: RightAngle(Angle(D, C, E)). So angle at C between D and E is a right angle. Hmm. So DC is perpendicular to EC? Or maybe DE is perpendicular to something? Wait, the angle is at C, so points D, C, E form a right angle. So angle DCE is a right angle. That means that DC and CE are perpendicular. 

Now, let's try to visualize this. We have triangle ABC with right angle at C. Points D and E are such that AD=DB and CE=EB. Also, angle DCE is a right angle. Maybe D and E are midpoints or points creating some right triangles?

Let me start by writing down equations from the length equalities. 

From AC = 3x + 11 and AC = 4y - 7, so 3x + 11 = 4y -7 → 3x - 4y = -18. Equation (1).

For BA, which is the hypotenuse, BA = 5x -8. Also, BA² = AC² + CB². Let's write that:

BA² = (5x -8)^2 = (AC)^2 + (CB)^2 = (3x+11)^2 + (2y -1)^2. 

But we also know that AC = 4y -7, so substituting that into the equation:

(5x -8)^2 = (4y -7)^2 + (2y -1)^2. 

So expanding these terms:

Left side: 25x² - 80x +64.

Right side: (16y² - 56y +49) + (4y² -4y +1) = 20y² -60y +50.

Therefore, 25x² -80x +64 = 20y² -60y +50.

Hmm, but we also have equation (1): 3x -4y = -18. Let me solve for one variable in terms of the other. From equation (1):

3x = 4y -18 → x = (4y -18)/3.

Maybe substitute this into the equation above. Let me do that. 

First, express x in terms of y: x = (4y -18)/3. Let me compute 25x²:

25x² = 25*( (4y -18)^2 ) / 9.

Similarly, expand the left side:

25x² -80x +64 becomes:

[25*( (4y -18)^2 ) /9 ] -80*(4y -18)/3 +64.

This seems complicated. Maybe instead of dealing with substitution here, look for another relationship. 

Wait, perhaps there's more info about D and E? Let me think. 

We have AD=DB, so D lies on AB such that AD=DB. Hence, D is the midpoint of AB. Similarly, CE=EB implies E is the midpoint of CB. 

Since E is the midpoint of CB, then CE = EB = (CB)/2. Given that CB = 2y -1, so CE = (2y -1)/2. 

Also, angle DCE is a right angle. So triangle DCE has a right angle at C. Therefore, DC and CE are perpendicular. So DC ⊥ CE. 

But CE is half of CB. Let me consider coordinates to model this. Maybe assigning coordinates to points could help. 

Let me place point C at the origin (0,0) since it's the right angle. Then, since ABC is right-angled at C, let’s assign coordinates:

Let’s set C at (0,0). Let’s assume AC is along the x-axis and CB along the y-axis. So point A is at (a, 0), point B is at (0, b). Then, AC = a units, CB = b units. 

Given that AC = 3x +11 and CB = 2y -1. Also, BA is the hypotenuse, which would be sqrt(a² + b²) = 5x -8. 

But also, AC = 4y -7. So a = 4y -7 and b = 2y -1. 

Thus, substituting into BA: sqrt(a² + b²) = 5x -8. Squaring both sides:

a² + b² = (5x -8)^2.

Substituting a and b:

(4y -7)^2 + (2y -1)^2 = (5x -8)^2.

Which is the same equation as before. And from earlier, we had a = 3x +11. Wait, hold on. Wait, earlier I said AC = 3x +11. But in my coordinate system, AC is a, which is 4y -7. So 3x +11 = 4y -7. Which gives 3x -4y = -18. 

So that's our equation (1). Now, let me see if I can find another relation involving x and y. 

Now, considering point D. Since D is the midpoint of AB, because AD=DB. Coordinates of A are (a, 0) = (4y -7, 0), and coordinates of B are (0, b) = (0, 2y -1). Midpoint D would be ((a+0)/2, (0 + b)/2) = (a/2, b/2). 

Coordinates of D: ( (4y -7)/2 , (2y -1)/2 )

Point E is the midpoint of CB. Since C is (0,0) and B is (0, 2y -1), midpoint E is ( (0 + 0)/2, (0 + 2y -1)/2 ) = (0, (2y -1)/2 ). 

Now, angle DCE is a right angle. So vectors CD and CE are perpendicular. Vector CD goes from C(0,0) to D( (4y -7)/2 , (2y -1)/2 ), so vector CD is ( (4y -7)/2 , (2y -1)/2 ). Vector CE goes from C(0,0) to E(0, (2y -1)/2 ), so vector CE is (0, (2y -1)/2 ). 

For these vectors to be perpendicular, their dot product must be zero. 

Dot product of CD and CE is [(4y -7)/2]*0 + [(2y -1)/2]*( (2y -1)/2 ) = 0 + [(2y -1)^2]/4. 

But this dot product must equal zero for them to be perpendicular. However, [(2y -1)^2]/4 = 0 implies that 2y -1 = 0 → y = 1/2. 

Wait, but if that's the case, then CB = 2y -1 = 0, which would make CB length zero, which doesn't make sense. There's a contradiction here. 

Hmm, so that suggests that my assumption might be wrong. Did I misinterpret the position of D or E? Let me check again. 

Wait, the angle DCE is a right angle. So the angle at point C between points D and E. So vectors CD and CE should be perpendicular. But according to the calculation, unless (2y -1)^2 = 0, which would require y = 1/2, but that leads to CB being zero. That can't be. Therefore, there's a mistake in my reasoning. 

Alternatively, maybe I made an error in interpreting the vectors. Let me re-examine. 

Vector CD is from C to D: D's coordinates minus C's coordinates. Since C is at (0,0), yes, CD is (D_x, D_y). CE is from C to E: E's coordinates minus C's coordinates. So CE is (E_x, E_y). 

Their dot product is CD_x * CE_x + CD_y * CE_y. 

In my previous calculation, CD_x is (4y -7)/2, CD_y is (2y -1)/2. CE_x is 0, CE_y is (2y -1)/2. 

So the dot product is [(4y -7)/2 * 0] + [(2y -1)/2 * (2y -1)/2] = 0 + [(2y -1)^2]/4. For this to be zero, (2y -1)^2 must be zero → y = 1/2. But this leads to CB = 0. Contradiction. 

So something is wrong here. Where did I go wrong? 

Ah! Wait, maybe E isn't the midpoint of CB? The predicate says Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,E)), LengthOf(Line(E,B))), so CE = EB. So E is the midpoint of CB, yes. So that part is correct. 

But then why does the dot product give us y=1/2 leading to CB=0? This suggests that either there's an error in the setup, or perhaps D isn't the midpoint of AB? Wait, the predicate says Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,D)), LengthOf(Line(D,B))). So AD=DB, hence D is the midpoint of AB. 

But if that's true, then the conclusion that y=1/2 is problematic. Unless... wait, maybe my coordinate assignment is incorrect. 

Alternative approach: Perhaps D is not on AB? Wait, the line AD and DB have equal lengths. So D could be anywhere such that AD=DB, but not necessarily on AB. However, without knowing the location of D, it's hard to proceed. 

Wait, but given that angle DCE is a right angle, and C is at (0,0), maybe D is not on AB? How can we reconcile this? 

Alternatively, perhaps my coordinate system assumption is flawed. Let me try another way. 

Suppose that triangle ABC is right-angled at C. Let me use variables for AC and CB. Let AC = 3x +11, CB = 2y -1, and BA = 5x -8. Also, from another predicate, AC = 4y -7. Therefore, 3x +11 = 4y -7 → 3x = 4y -18 → x = (4y -18)/3. 

So substituting into BA: BA = 5x -8 = 5*(4y -18)/3 -8 = (20y -90)/3 - 24/3 = (20y -114)/3. 

But BA is also the hypotenuse, so BA² = AC² + CB². 

Calculating BA²:

[(20y -114)/3]^2 = (AC)^2 + (CB)^2 = (4y -7)^2 + (2y -1)^2.

Expanding RHS:

(16y² -56y +49) + (4y² -4y +1) = 20y² -60y +50.

LHS: [(20y -114)/3]^2 = (400y² - 4560y + 12996)/9.

Setting equal:

(400y² - 4560y + 12996)/9 = 20y² -60y +50.

Multiply both sides by 9:

400y² -4560y +12996 = 180y² -540y +450.

Bring all terms to left:

400y² -4560y +12996 -180y² +540y -450 = 0.

Combine like terms:

(400y² -180y²) + (-4560y +540y) + (12996 -450) = 0.

220y² -4020y +12546 = 0.

Divide all terms by 2:

110y² -2010y +6273 = 0.

Hmm, this quadratic equation may be difficult to solve. Let me check if I made any calculation errors. 

Wait, let me recalculate the expansion of [(20y -114)/3]^2. 

(20y -114)^2 = (20y)^2 - 2*20y*114 + 114^2 = 400y² - 4560y + 12996. Yes. Divided by 9. Correct. 

On the other hand, RHS after multiplying by 9: 20y²*9 = 180y², -60y*9 = -540y, 50*9=450. Correct. 

Then moving everything to left:

400y² -4560y +12996 -180y² +540y -450 = 0. 

Yes, 400y² -180y² = 220y². -4560y +540y = -4020y. 12996 -450 = 12546. Correct. 

So equation is 220y² -4020y +12546 = 0. Divide by 2: 110y² -2010y +6273 = 0. 

Let me simplify further. Maybe divide by common factors. Let's see if 110 and 2010 and 6273 have common divisors. 

Check GCD of coefficients:

GCD(110, 2010): 110 divides into 2010 how many times? 2010 ÷ 110 = 18.27... So GCD(110, 2010). Factors of 110: 2×5×11. Check if 2 divides 2010: yes. 2010 ÷ 2 = 1005. So GCD is 2? Wait, original equation is 110y² -2010y +6273 = 0. Let me check if 110 and 2010 share a factor. 2010 divided by 10 is 201. 110 divided by 10 is 11. So GCD is 10? No, because 11 is prime. Wait, 110 = 10 × 11, 2010 = 201 × 10. So GCD is 10? Not sure. Maybe better to use quadratic formula. 

Quadratic equation: 110y² -2010y +6273 = 0. 

Discriminant D = (2010)^2 - 4*110*6273. Let me calculate:

First, 2010 squared: 2010*2010. Well, 2000² = 4,000,000, plus 2*2000*10 + 10² = 4,000,000 + 40,000 + 100 = 4,040,100. 

Then, 4*110*6273 = 440 * 6273. Let me compute that. 

Well, 440 × 6273 = ?

Breakdown: 400 × 6273 = 2,509,200; 40 × 6273 = 250,920. Total: 2,509,200 + 250,920 = 2,760,120. 

So discriminant D = 4,040,100 - 2,760,120 = 1,279,980. 

Now, sqrt(1,279,980). Let me approximate. 

What's 1130² = 1,276,900. 1135² = (1130 +5)^2 = 1130² + 2*1130*5 +25 = 1,276,900 + 11,300 +25 = 1,288,225. Our D is 1,279,980, which is between 1130² and 1135². 

Compute 1130² = 1,276,900. Difference: 1,279,980 - 1,276,900 = 3,080. 

Each increment of y increases the square by approximately 2*1130 +1 = 2261 per unit. So approximating sqrt(D) ≈ 1130 + 3080/2261 ≈ 1130 + 1.36 ≈ 1131.36. 

So roots are [2010 ± 1131.36]/(2*110) = [2010 ± 1131.36]/220. 

Calculate positive root:

2010 + 1131.36 = 3141.36 → 3141.36 / 220 ≈ 14.28.

Other root: 2010 - 1131.36 = 878.64 → 878.64 /220 ≈ 3.99. 

So approximate solutions y ≈ 14.28 or y ≈ 3.99. 

But this seems messy. Maybe there's a mistake earlier. Let me check if I used the correct expressions for BA. 

Earlier, I expressed BA as 5x -8, and substituted x = (4y -18)/3. Thus, BA = 5*(4y -18)/3 -8 = (20y -90)/3 - 24/3 = (20y -114)/3. Correct. 

Then BA² = [(20y -114)/3]^2 = (400y² - 4560y + 12996)/9. 

And AC² + CB² = (4y-7)^2 + (2y-1)^2 = 16y² -56y +49 +4y² -4y +1 = 20y² -60y +50. 

So equate: (400y² -4560y +12996)/9 = 20y² -60y +50. Multiply both sides by 9:

400y² -4560y +12996 = 180y² -540y +450. 

Then 400y² -180y² = 220y². -4560y +540y = -4020y. 12996 -450 = 12546. So 220y² -4020y +12546 = 0. 

Yes, that's correct. 

But solving this quadratic gives us non-integer values for y, which complicates things. However, the answer choices are decimals like 9.5, 10.5, etc., suggesting that x is likely a decimal. 

But maybe there's another relationship from the angle DCE being right. Earlier, I found that the dot product led to y=1/2, but that caused CB=0. That suggests that perhaps my coordinate system assumption was wrong. Alternatively, maybe D is not the midpoint of AB, but some other point?

Wait, the predicate says Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,D)), LengthOf(Line(D,B))). So AD = DB. This means D lies on the perpendicular bisector of AB. In a coordinate system, if AB is from A(a,0) to B(0,b), then the perpendicular bisector would be the line that is perpendicular to AB and passes through its midpoint. 

Midpoint of AB is (a/2, b/2). The slope of AB is (b - 0)/(0 - a) = -b/a. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector has slope a/b. 

So the equation of the perpendicular bisector is y - b/2 = (a/b)(x - a/2). 

Point D lies on this line. Additionally, angle DCE is a right angle. So point D is somewhere on this perpendicular bisector such that CD ⊥ CE. 

But CE is from C(0,0) to E(0, (2y-1)/2), as earlier. So vector CE is vertical (since x-coordinate is 0). Vector CD is from C(0,0) to D(x_d, y_d). For CD to be perpendicular to CE (which is vertical), CD must be horizontal. Because vertical and horizontal are perpendicular. 

Wait, if CE is vertical (as E is on the y-axis), then CD needs to be horizontal for them to be perpendicular. So vector CD must be horizontal, i.e., have direction along x-axis. So D must lie on the x-axis. 

Therefore, D has coordinates (d, 0). Since D lies on the perpendicular bisector of AB. 

Let me verify. If D is on the x-axis, then its y-coordinate is 0. Let me find the intersection of the perpendicular bisector with the x-axis. 

Perpendicular bisector equation: y - b/2 = (a/b)(x - a/2). Setting y = 0:

- b/2 = (a/b)(x - a/2)

Multiply both sides by b:

- b²/2 = a(x - a/2)

→ x = a/2 - (b²)/(2a)

So coordinates of D are (a/2 - b²/(2a), 0). 

But D also lies on the x-axis, so its y-coordinate is 0. 

Now, since CD is from (0,0) to D(x_d, 0), which is along the x-axis. CE is vertical, so CD is horizontal, hence perpendicular. Therefore, angle DCE is indeed a right angle. 

Great! So this resolves the earlier contradiction. Because previously, I assumed D was the midpoint of AB, but actually, D is on the perpendicular bisector, but not necessarily the midpoint. Wait, but AD=DB implies that D is on the perpendicular bisector. 

So now, we have coordinates of D as (a/2 - b²/(2a), 0). 

But also, AD = DB. Let me confirm that. 

Distance from A(a,0) to D(x_d, 0) is |a - x_d|. Distance from D(x_d, 0) to B(0,b) is sqrt((x_d - 0)^2 + (0 - b)^2) = sqrt(x_d² + b²). 

Setting these equal: |a - x_d| = sqrt(x_d² + b²). Square both sides:

(a - x_d)^2 = x_d² + b² → a² - 2ax_d + x_d² = x_d² + b² → a² - 2ax_d = b² → 2ax_d = a² - b² → x_d = (a² - b²)/(2a). 

Which matches the earlier expression for x_d: a/2 - b²/(2a) = (a² - b²)/(2a). 

So that's consistent. 

Now, since we've determined that D is at ( (a² - b²)/(2a), 0 ), and E is at (0, (2y -1)/2 ). 

Now, since angle DCE is a right angle, which we already ensured by placing D on x-axis and E on y-axis. 

But how does this help us find x and y? 

Well, we still have the equation from the earlier quadratic, but perhaps there's another relation from the coordinates of D? 

Alternatively, since we have coordinates for D, and E, maybe there's a relation involving them? Or perhaps another equation? 

Wait, we have from the earlier equations:

We had 3x +11 = 4y -7 → 3x = 4y -18 → x = (4y -18)/3. 

Also, from BA² = AC² + CB². 

But we also have expressions for a and b in terms of y. Recall that AC = a = 4y -7, CB = b = 2y -1. 

So a = 4y -7, b = 2y -1. 

Then, from the equation 220y² -4020y +12546 = 0. 

Alternatively, maybe plug in the answer choices to find which one satisfies the equation. 

The answer choices are A. 9.5, B. 10.5, C. 12.5, D. 13.5. These correspond to x values. So let's try each x value and see if it satisfies the equation. 

But we need to relate x and y via 3x +11 = 4y -7 → y = (3x +18)/4. 

So if we take each x value, compute y, and then plug into the quadratic equation. 

Let me attempt this. 

Let's denote x as the value from the options. 

Option A: x = 9.5. 

Then y = (3*9.5 +18)/4 = (28.5 +18)/4 = 46.5/4 = 11.625. 

Plug y = 11.625 into the quadratic equation 110y² -2010y +6273 = 0. 

Calculate 110*(11.625)^2 -2010*(11.625) +6273. 

First, compute 11.625^2: 11.625 * 11.625. Let me compute this:

11.625 = 11 + 0.625 = 11 + 5/8. 

Square: (11 + 5/8)^2 = 121 + 2*11*(5/8) + (5/8)^2 = 121 + 110/8 + 25/64. 

Convert to decimals: 121 + 13.75 + 0.390625 = 135.140625. 

Then multiply by 110: 135.140625 * 110 = 14865.46875. 

Next term: 2010 * 11.625 = 2010 * 11 + 2010 * 0.625 = 22110 + 1256.25 = 23366.25. 

Now, total expression: 14865.46875 - 23366.25 + 6273 = 

Calculate 14865.46875 - 23366.25 = -8500.78125 + 6273 = -2227.78125 ≠ 0. So not zero. 

Option B: x = 10.5. 

y = (3*10.5 +18)/4 = (31.5 +18)/4 = 49.5/4 = 12.375. 

Plugging y = 12.375 into the quadratic equation:

110*(12.375)^2 -2010*12.375 +6273. 

First, 12.375^2: 

12.375 = 12 + 0.375 = 12 + 3/8. 

Square: 144 + 2*12*(3/8) + (3/8)^2 = 144 + 9 + 9/64 = 153 + 0.140625 = 153.140625. 

Multiply by 110: 153.140625 * 110 = 16845.46875. 

Next term: 2010 * 12.375 = 2010 * 12 + 2010 * 0.375 = 24120 + 753.75 = 24873.75. 

Total expression: 16845.46875 -24873.75 +6273 = 16845.46875 -24873.75 = -8028.28125 +6273 = -1755.28125 ≠ 0. 

Not zero. 

Option C: x = 12.5. 

y = (3*12.5 +18)/4 = (37.5 +18)/4 = 55.5/4 = 13.875. 

Plugging into equation: 

110*(13.875)^2 -2010*13.875 +6273. 

Calculate 13.875^2: 

13.875 = 13 + 0.875 = 13 + 7/8. 

Square: 169 + 2*13*(7/8) + (7/8)^2 = 169 + 18.25 + 0.765625 = 187.015625. 

Multiply by 110: 187.015625 * 110 = 20571.71875. 

Next term: 2010 * 13.875 = 2010*(13 + 0.875) = 2010*13 + 2010*0.875 = 26130 + 1766.25 = 27896.25. 

Total expression: 20571.71875 -27896.25 +6273 = 20571.71875 -27896.25 = -7324.53125 +6273 = -1051.53125 ≠ 0. 

Still not zero. 

Option D: x = 13.5. 

y = (3*13.5 +18)/4 = (40.5 +18)/4 = 58.5/4 = 14.625. 

Plugging into equation: 

110*(14.625)^2 -2010*14.625 +6273. 

First, 14.625^2: 

14.625 = 14 + 0.625 = 14 + 5/8. 

Square: 196 + 2*14*(5/8) + (5/8)^2 = 196 + 17.5 + 0.390625 = 213.890625. 

Multiply by 110: 213.890625 * 110 = 23527.96875. 

Next term: 2010*14.625 = 2010*(14 + 0.625) = 2010*14 + 2010*0.625 = 28140 + 1256.25 = 29396.25. 

Total expression: 23527.96875 -29396.25 +6273 = 23527.96875 -29396.25 = -5868.28125 +6273 = 404.71875 ≠ 0. 

None of the options satisfy the equation. Hmm. This suggests that perhaps there's a miscalculation in deriving the quadratic equation. 

Wait, going back to the earlier step where I equated BA² = AC² + CB². Let me double-check that. 

BA is the hypotenuse of triangle ABC, which is right-angled at C. So yes, BA² = AC² + CB². 

But from earlier, we have AC = 4y -7, CB = 2y -1, and BA = 5x -8. Also, from AC = 3x +11, so 3x +11 = 4y -7. 

So substituting AC and CB into BA²:

(5x -8)^2 = (4y -7)^2 + (2y -1)^2. 

And since 3x +11 = 4y -7 → x = (4y -18)/3. 

So substituting x into the equation:

(5*(4y -18)/3 -8)^2 = (4y -7)^2 + (2y -1)^2. 

Let me recompute this. 

First, compute 5*(4y -18)/3 -8: 

= (20y -90)/3 - 8 
= (20y -90)/3 - 24/3 
= (20y -114)/3. 

So squaring this gives (20y -114)^2 /9. 

On the other hand, the RHS is (4y-7)^2 + (2y-1)^2 = 16y² -56y +49 +4y² -4y +1 = 20y² -60y +50. 

So setting equal:

(20y -114)^2 /9 = 20y² -60y +50. 

Multiply both sides by 9:

(20y -114)^2 = 180y² -540y +450. 

Expand left side:

(20y)^2 - 2*20y*114 + 114^2 = 400y² - 4560y + 12996. 

Set equal to RHS: 400y² -4560y +12996 = 180y² -540y +450. 

Bringing all terms to left:

400y² -4560y +12996 -180y² +540y -450 = 0 → 220y² -4020y +12546 = 0. 

Same as before. So the equation is correct. 

But none of the options for x yield y that makes this equation zero. What's wrong here? 

Perhaps there's another condition from the angle DCE being right. Earlier, we considered that D lies on x-axis and E on y-axis, making CD horizontal and CE vertical, hence perpendicular. But is there any other constraint? 

Wait, we also have that D lies on the perpendicular bisector of AB, which gave us x_d = (a² - b²)/(2a). 

But also, since D is on the x-axis, its coordinates are (x_d, 0). 

But we might also derive another equation from this. 

Let me recall that in this scenario, D is at ( (a² - b²)/(2a), 0 ). 

But also, from the earlier condition, we have AC = 4y -7, CB = 2y -1, and a = AC = 4y -7, b = CB = 2y -1. 

So substituting a = 4y -7 and b = 2y -1 into x_d: 

x_d = (a² - b²)/(2a) = [(4y -7)^2 - (2y -1)^2]/(2*(4y -7)).

Expand numerator: (16y² -56y +49) - (4y² -4y +1) = 12y² -52y +48. 

So x_d = (12y² -52y +48)/(2*(4y -7)) = [4(3y² -13y +12)]/(2*(4y -7)) = [2(3y² -13y +12)]/(4y -7). 

But I don't see how this helps directly. 

However, since D is a point in the plane, and there might be no additional constraints, unless there's a missing relationship. 

Wait, but maybe there's a relation between x and y from this expression? Or maybe from the fact that x_d is the x-coordinate of D, and there's no restriction on it except being real. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that the entire setup is consistent. Maybe there's a unique solution that fits all conditions, but due to calculation errors, the quadratic didn't resolve properly. 

Alternatively, let's try solving the quadratic equation numerically. 

Equation: 220y² -4020y +12546 = 0. 

Using quadratic formula: y = [4020 ± sqrt(4020² -4*220*12546)]/(2*220). 

Compute discriminant D = 4020² -4*220*12546. 

Calculate 4020² = (4000 + 20)^2 = 4000² + 2*4000*20 + 20² = 16,000,000 + 160,000 + 400 = 16,160,400. 

Now, 4*220*12546 = 880*12546. Let's compute that: 

12546 * 880 = 12546 * 800 + 12546 * 80 = 10,036,800 + 1,003,680 = 11,040,480. 

So D = 16,160,400 - 11,040,480 = 5,119,920. 

sqrt(5,119,920). Let me estimate this. 

What's 2262²? 2260² = 5,107,600. 2262² = (2260 + 2)^2 = 2260² + 4*2260 +4 = 5,107,600 + 9,040 +4 = 5,116,644. Still less than 5,119,920. 

Next, 2263² = 2262² + 2*2262 +1 = 5,116,644 + 4,524 +1 = 5,121,169. 

Our D is 5,119,920, which is between 2262² and 2263². 

So approximate sqrt(D) ≈ 2262 + (5,119,920 -5,116,644)/(2*2262 +1) ≈ 2262 + (3,276)/4525 ≈ 2262 + 0.724 ≈ 2262.724. 

So y ≈ [4020 ± 2262.724]/440. 

First, positive root: (4020 + 2262.724)/440 ≈ 6282.724 /440 ≈ 14.279. 

Second root: (4020 -2262.724)/440 ≈ 1757.276/440 ≈ 3.9938. 

So y ≈ 14.28 or y ≈ 3.99. 

Now, let's compute x from x = (4y -18)/3. 

For y ≈14.28: x = (4*14.28 -18)/3 ≈ (57.12 -18)/3 ≈ 39.12/3 ≈ 13.04. 

For y ≈3.99: x = (4*3.99 -18)/3 ≈ (15.96 -18)/3 ≈ (-2.04)/3 ≈ -0.68. 

Negative x doesn't make sense in this context, as lengths are positive. So discard y ≈3.99. 

Thus, x ≈13.04. Looking at the answer choices: D is 13.5, which is
