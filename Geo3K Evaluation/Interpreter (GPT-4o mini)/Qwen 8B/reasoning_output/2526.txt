MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. The question says to find the measure of angle 2 given that AB is perpendicular to BC. Hmm, but wait, there's no diagram provided. That's tricky. Since I can't see the image, I have to rely solely on the given information and standard geometric principles.

First, let me parse the given predicate: AB ⊥ BC. So, AB is perpendicular to BC. That means the angle between AB and BC is 90 degrees. But how does this relate to angle 2? Without knowing where angle 2 is located, it's hard to say. Maybe angle 2 is part of a triangle or some other figure involving these lines?

Wait, maybe there's more context implied here. In many problems, when two lines are perpendicular, they form right angles, which can lead to forming right triangles. For example, if AB and BC are sides of a triangle, then angle at B would be 90 degrees. But angle 2 could be another angle in that triangle or perhaps an exterior angle.

Alternatively, maybe there's a transversal involved, or some intersecting lines creating vertical angles or supplementary angles. Let's consider different scenarios.

Case 1: Suppose we have triangle ABC where AB is perpendicular to BC. Then triangle ABC is a right triangle with the right angle at B. In that case, angles at A and C would add up to 90 degrees. However, without knowing more about the triangle, like side lengths or other angles, we can't determine angle 2 unless there's more info.

Case 2: Maybe angle 2 is formed by some intersection of lines. For instance, if there are two lines intersecting at point B, making AB and BC perpendicular. Then, angle 2 could be one of the adjacent angles formed by those lines. Wait, but if AB is perpendicular to BC, then the angle between them is 90°, so any other angles around that intersection would depend on other lines.

But since the answer choices are numerical (64, 68, 72, 76), it suggests that there's a specific numeric value expected, implying that there's more information missing from the problem description. Wait, the original question mentions "angle 2"—so maybe angle 2 refers to a specific angle in a diagram that isn't described here. This is confusing because without seeing the diagram, it's impossible to know the exact configuration.

Hold on, maybe there was supposed to be a diagram accompanying this problem, but it's not included here. The user mentioned that they can't analyze images, so they might have intended to provide a diagram but forgot. Alternatively, maybe the problem is referencing a common setup where AB ⊥ BC leads to certain angle measures.

Wait, sometimes in such problems, angle numbers refer to specific angles in a figure. For example, if AB is perpendicular to BC, and there are other lines forming angles with them. Like, suppose there's a transversal or another line creating angles that we need to calculate.

Another possibility: if AB is perpendicular to BC, and there's a line CD forming some angle with AB or BC, leading to angle 2 being part of a triangle or something. Without specifics, though, this is too vague.

Alternatively, maybe angle 2 is an alternate interior angle or corresponding angle due to some parallel lines. But again, without knowing the full configuration, it's hard to tell.

Wait, perhaps this is part of a larger problem where angle 2 is determined by using the fact that AB is perpendicular to BC. For example, if AB ⊥ BC, then angle ABC is 90°, and maybe angle 2 is part of a triangle where we can use the sum of angles or Pythagoras' theorem. But again, without more data, this is speculative.

Since the answer choices are all multiples of 4 (64, 68, 72, 76), maybe the problem involves complementary or supplementary angles. For example, if angle 2 is complementary to 90°, then angle 2 would be 90° minus some value. But again, without knowing the relation, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe angle 2 is in a triangle with AB and BC as sides, but then we need more information about the triangle's type or other angles. For example, if AB and BC are legs of a right triangle, and angle 2 is one of the acute angles. But unless we have side ratios or other angles, we can't compute the exact measure.

Hmm, this seems unsolvable without the diagram. But since the user has provided answer choices, maybe there's a standard problem they're referring to. For example, if AB is perpendicular to BC, and there's another line forming a specific angle, like angle 2 being an exterior angle or something.

Wait, maybe angle 2 is vertically opposite to another angle created by the perpendicular lines. For example, if two lines cross, forming vertical angles. But again, without knowing the exact configuration, this is guesswork.

Alternatively, think of a square or rectangle where AB and BC are adjacent sides, making a right angle. If angle 2 is an angle inside a triangle formed by diagonals or something. But again, without specifics, I can't proceed.

Given that I have to choose an answer from the options, maybe there's a typical problem where AB ⊥ BC implies that angle 2 is found via some relationship. For instance, if AB is perpendicular to BC, and angle 2 is an angle in a triangle where other angles are known.

Wait, maybe angle 2 is an angle formed by extending a line. For example, if AB is perpendicular to BC, and there's a line BD forming an angle with AB or BC. Suppose angle 2 is ∠ABD or something. If BD bisects angle ABC, but since ABC is 90°, then each angle would be 45°, but none of the answer choices are 45. Alternatively, maybe there's some other construction.

Alternatively, consider that AB ⊥ BC, so angle ABC is 90°. If there's a triangle ABC with AB and BC as legs, and angle 2 is an external angle. For example, if there's a line from point A to some point D, forming an angle with BC. But again, too vague.

Wait, maybe angle 2 refers to an angle in a different triangle connected to the right angle. For instance, if there's a transversal cutting across AB and BC, creating alternate angles. But without knowing the specifics, it's impossible to say.

Since I'm stuck, maybe I should consider that the problem is part of a set where angle 2 is determined via some classic configuration. For example, if AB ⊥ BC, and there's a triangle where angle 2 is 90° minus another angle. But again, without more data, this is just guessing.

Alternatively, if angle 2 is part of a cyclic quadrilateral where AB ⊥ BC, but that also requires more information.

Wait, perhaps the problem is similar to ones where two perpendicular lines create angles that are used in trigonometry. For example, if AB is horizontal and BC is vertical, then angle 2 could be a slope angle. But again, without specific data, I can't compute.

Given that I have to pick an answer from the given options, and considering that in many standard problems, when you have a right angle and other angles, the measure often relates to common angles like 30-60-90 or 45-45-90 triangles. However, none of the answer choices fit directly into those. 

Wait, maybe angle 2 is part of an isosceles right triangle, where the angles are 45°, 45°, 90°. But again, none of the options are 45. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a 3-4-5 triangle, but the angles in that aren't standard. Or maybe using some ratio. Wait, but without side lengths, we can't determine the angles.

This is really challenging without the diagram. Given that, perhaps there's a typo or missing information. But assuming that the problem expects us to know a standard configuration, maybe angle 2 is 68°, which is one of the options. But why 68?

Alternatively, maybe angle 2 is formed by two lines intersecting, with AB and BC as perpendicular, leading to angle 2 being supplementary or complementary to some other angle. For example, if angle 2 is adjacent to the right angle, then it would be 90° minus some value. But again, without knowing the other angles, this is unclear.

At this point, since I can't resolve the ambiguity without the diagram, I might have to make an educated guess based on common problems. One common scenario is that if AB ⊥ BC, then angle ABC is 90°, and if angle 2 is an exterior angle to a triangle involving that right angle. For example, if there's a triangle where angle 2 is outside the right angle, then maybe angle 2 equals the sum of the other two angles. But without knowing the other angles, this is still uncertain.

Alternatively, if angle 2 is an angle in a triangle where AB and BC are sides, and using the fact that the sum of angles is 180°, but again, insufficient data.

Considering the answer choices, 64, 68, 72, 76—these are all even numbers. Perhaps angle 2 is 68°, which is close to 70°, a common angle in some problems. But this is pure speculation.

Alternatively, if there's a transversal crossing two lines, and AB ⊥ BC creates some angles that are used in calculating angle 2. For example, if AB is perpendicular to BC, and another line forms an angle with AB, then angle 2 could be calculated using supplementary angles. But again, without specifics, it's impossible.

In conclusion, without the diagram, it's extremely difficult to determine the exact measure of angle 2. However, since the answer choices are present, and considering common geometric problems, I'll take a guess that the answer is B. 68°, as it's a common angle in various configurations. But this is purely a guess due to lack of information.
