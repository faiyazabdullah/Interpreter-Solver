MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, we have several points and lines defined here. Let's start by listing out all the given information.

First, the points mentioned are A, B, C, D, E. Then there are lines connecting them: D-A, A-E, E-D, B-E, E-C, C-B. Also, some angles are given with measures. The question is asking for the measure of angle 2, but I need to figure out which angle that refers to. Wait, maybe angle 2 is one of the ones listed? Or perhaps it's referring to another angle formed by these lines?

Let me parse the predicates again. The angles mentioned are:

Angle(D, A, E) = 47 degrees,
Angle(A, E, D) = 57 degrees,
Angle(A, B, E) = 55 degrees.

Also, there are other angles like Angle(E, D, A), Angle(B, E, C), Angle(E, C, B). But those might not be directly given. Wait, the first three angles are specified with their measures. Let me visualize this setup.

So, starting with point A connected to D and E. Then E is connected to D and C. B is connected to E and C. So maybe there's a triangle involved here. Let me sketch mentally.

Points D, A, E form a triangle because D-A-E-D? Wait, Line(D,A), Line(A,E), Line(E,D). That forms triangle ADE. Then, Line(B,E) and Line(E,C), Line(C,B) form triangle BEC. Also, points A, B, E are connected, so maybe triangle ABE?

Wait, the angles given are:

Angle at A between D and E: angle DAE = 47°, since it's written as Angle(D, A, E). Similarly, Angle(A, E, D) would be the angle at E between A and D. Wait, angle AED? So, angle at E between A and D. And that's 57°. So in triangle ADE, angles at A and E are 47° and 57° respectively. Therefore, the third angle at D would be 180 - 47 - 57 = 76°. So angle ADE is 76°, but wait, is that part of the given info? Not sure yet.

Then, there's angle ABE, which is Angle(A, B, E) = 55°. So angle at B between A and E. So triangle ABE has angle at B of 55°, and maybe other angles?

Now, looking at the diagram, points B and C are connected via E and C. So E is connected to B and C, and C connected to B. So triangle BEC. Also, angle at E between B and C: Angle(B, E, C) is given? Wait, the given angles are Angle(A, B, E) = 55°, which is angle at E between A and B? Wait, no. Wait, the angle notation is (Vertex, Side1, Side2). So Angle(A, B, E) means the angle at point B between points A and E. So vertex at B, sides BA and BE. So angle ABE = 55°. 

Similarly, Angle(B, E, C) would be angle at E between B and C. So that's angle BEC. And Angle(E, C, B) is angle at C between E and B, so angle ECB.

But none of these angles' measures are given except for the first three. However, maybe there are some relationships between these angles. For example, if we consider triangle BEC, maybe we can find some angles.

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle ABE and triangle BEC share some relations. Let's think about triangle ABE. We know angle at B is 55°, and angle at E? Wait, angle at E in triangle ABE would be angle AEB. Is that given? Well, angle AEB is part of the previous angles. Since angle AED is 57°, and if points B and C are connected to E, maybe there's a way to relate these angles.

Wait, let me try to map out the diagram step by step.

Starting with triangle ADE. Points D, A, E. Angles at A: 47°, at E: 57°, so angle at D is 76°, as calculated before. Now, point B is connected to E, and point C is connected to E and B. So point E is connected to A, D, B, and C. So E is a common point connected to four others. Then, C is connected to B. So triangle BEC is formed with points B, E, C.

In triangle ABE, angle at B is 55°, as given. What about angle at E in triangle ABE? That would be angle AEB. How does that relate to other angles?

Since angle AED is 57°, which is angle at E between A and D. If we look at point E, connected to A, D, B, and C. So around point E, there are several angles. For instance, angle AED is 57°, and angle BEA (which is part of angle AEB?) Maybe there's a relationship here.

Wait, if we consider the straight line at point E. Suppose we have lines EA, EB, EC, ED. Depending on how they're arranged, the sum of angles around E could be 360°, but since we have lines going in different directions, maybe some of these angles are adjacent.

For example, suppose at point E, the angles around it are angle AED (57°), angle AEB (let's call it x), and angle BEC (let's say y), and maybe another angle if there are more lines. Wait, but the given angles are AED=57°, and angle ABE=55°, which is angle at B. Maybe we need to find some relations using triangle angles or vertical angles, or something else.

Alternatively, maybe triangle ABE and triangle BEC are connected. Let me check.

In triangle ABE, we know angle at B is 55°, and angle at E is angle AEB. Let's denote that as θ. Then angle at A would be angle BAE. Wait, but angle at A in triangle ABE is part of the original triangle ADE. In triangle ADE, angle at A was 47°, which is angle DAE. If point B is somewhere such that AB connects to E, then angle DAE is separate from angle BAE? Unless B lies on AD, but that's not stated.

Wait, unless points D, A, B are colinear? No, because there's a line DA and line AE, but not necessarily involving B. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe triangle ABE shares side AE with triangle ADE. So, in triangle ABE, angle at E is angle AEB, which may be supplementary to angle AED if points B and D are on opposite sides of AE. But without knowing the configuration, it's hard to tell.

Wait, but maybe considering that angle AED is 57°, and if angle AEB is part of that, then angle AEB + angle BED = angle AED? Not sure.

Alternatively, if we consider that in triangle ABE, angles sum to 180. So angle at B is 55°, angle at E is something, and angle at A is something. But angle at A in triangle ABE is angle BAE. How does that relate to the angle DAE of 47°?

If point B is positioned such that AB is extending from A, then angle BAE would be part of angle DAE. But unless there's more info, this is unclear.

Wait, maybe there's a transversal or parallel lines involved? Or maybe triangle similarity?

Alternatively, focusing on triangle BEC. If we can find some angles there. For example, angle at E is angle BEC, which is part of the angles at E. If we can find that angle, maybe we can use triangle BEC's angles to find other parts.

But how do we get there? Let me think again.

We know angle AED is 57°, which is angle between EA and ED. Also, angle ABE is 55°, which is angle at B between A and E.

Is there a possibility that triangle ABE and triangle EDC are similar or something? Not sure.

Wait, maybe considering the sum of angles around point E. If we assume that lines EA, EB, EC, ED are arranged around E, then the total angles around E should add up to 360°. However, we only have two angles given directly: angle AED (between EA and ED) is 57°, and angle AEB (if we can find that). But unless we have more info about other angles at E, this might not be helpful.

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle where we can apply the law of sines or cosines? For example, in triangle ADE, we know two angles and thus can find the third, which gives us angle at D as 76°, as earlier. Then, if we can relate this to other triangles.

Another thought: since there's a line from E to C and from C to B, forming triangle BEC. If we can find angles in triangle BEC, maybe we can find some relations. For example, if we can find angle at E (BEC), then using triangle angles.

But how to find angle BEC? Let's think. If we can express angle BEC in terms of other angles.

Suppose that at point E, the angles around it are angle AED (57°), angle AEB (let's call it x), angle BEC (y), and maybe another angle if there's another line. Wait, but the given lines at E are EA, ED, EB, EC. So, depending on the order of the points, the angles could be adjacent.

Assuming that points D, A, B, C are arranged around E in some order. For example, if we imagine E as the center, with lines going to A, D, B, C. If angle AED is between EA and ED (57°), and angle AEB is between EA and EB (which we don't know), and angle BEC is between EB and EC, and angle CED is between EC and ED. But unless we know the order, it's tricky.

But perhaps, assuming that points are arranged in such a way that angle AED (57°) is adjacent to angle AEB (x), making the total angle between ED and EB as 57° + x? Or maybe overlapping?

Alternatively, if we consider that angle AED is 57°, and angle AEB is part of that. For example, if B is on the same side of EA as D, then angle AEB plus angle BED equals angle AED. Wait, that's possible. So angle AEB + angle BED = angle AED (57°). But we don't know angle BED.

But maybe angle BED relates to other parts. For instance, if we can find angle at E in triangle BED or something. However, without more info, this seems difficult.

Alternatively, maybe triangle ABE and triangle CEB are connected somehow. Given that angle ABE is 55°, which is in triangle ABE. If we can find another angle in triangle ABE, then we can find the third angle.

In triangle ABE, angles are at A, B, E. We know angle at B is 55°, and if we can find either angle at A or E, we can compute the rest. But angle at A in triangle ABE is angle BAE. How does that relate to the angle DAE of 47°?

If point B is along AD, then angle BAE would be part of angle DAE. But since we don't know if that's the case, this is uncertain. Alternatively, if AB is not on AD, then angle BAE is separate.

This is getting complicated. Maybe there's another approach.

Looking back at the given angles: angle DAE = 47°, angle AED = 57°, angle ABE = 55°. The question is asking for angle 2. Assuming that angle 2 refers to one of the angles mentioned, possibly angle BEC or another.

Wait, the options are A.49, B.55, C.57, D.76. So 55 is already given as angle ABE. 57 is angle AED. 76 came from the calculation in triangle ADE. So maybe angle 2 is 76°, which is angle at D in triangle ADE? But why would that be called angle 2?

Alternatively, maybe angle 2 is angle BEC. Let me see.

If we can find angle BEC, which is part of triangle BEC. To find that, we need more info. Let me think about triangle BEC. If we can find two angles, we can find the third.

But how? Let's consider that in triangle BEC, angle at E is angle BEC, angle at B is angle EBC, and angle at C is angle ECB.

Do we have any info about those? Well, angle EBC is part of angle ABC. Wait, but we don't have info about point C's connections. Wait, point C is connected to E and B. So in triangle BEC, angle at B is angle EBC. If we can find that, then we can proceed.

Alternatively, maybe there's a relation between triangles ABE and BEC. For example, if they are similar or have some proportional sides. But without side lengths, that's hard.

Wait, but maybe using the fact that in triangle ABE, we know angle at B is 55°, and if we can find another angle, we can find the third. For example, if angle at E (AEB) is known, then angle at A (BAE) would be 180 - 55 - angle AEB.

But how to find angle AEB? Earlier, we considered that angle AED is 57°, and if angle AEB is part of that. Suppose that angle AEB and angle BED together make up angle AED. So angle AEB + angle BED = 57°. If we can find angle BED, then we can find angle AEB.

What is angle BED? It's the angle at E between B and D. So that would be part of triangle BED. But we don't have much info about that triangle. However, if we consider triangle ADE, we found angle at D is 76°, which is angle ADE. If we can relate that to angle BED.

Wait, angle ADE is 76°, which is the angle at D between A and E. If point B is connected to E, and point C is connected to E and B, then maybe there's a way to connect these angles.

Alternatively, thinking about triangle ADE and triangle BDE. If BD is a line, but we don't have that info. This is getting too vague.

Maybe I'm missing something. Let's recap:

Given:

- Triangle ADE with angles at A: 47°, at E: 57°, so angle at D is 76°.

- Angle ABE = 55°, which is in triangle ABE.

If I can find angle AEB (at E in triangle ABE), then I can find angle BAE (at A in triangle ABE).

Once I have that, maybe angle BAE relates to angle DAE (47°)? Like, if B is on AD, then angle BAE would be part of angle DAE, making angle BAE = 47° minus something. But again, without knowing the position of B, this is uncertain.

Wait, but suppose that point B lies on AD extended. Then, angle DAE is 47°, and if AB is a segment from A to B on the extension of AD, then angle BAE would be supplementary to angle DAE? Wait, no. If B is on AD extended beyond D, then angle BAE would be 180° - angle DAE. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, if B is on the other side of A relative to D, then angle BAE would be something else. Without a diagram, it's challenging, but maybe we can assume some standard configuration.

Let me try assuming that points are arranged such that D, A, E form triangle ADE, and point B is somewhere such that AB connects to E. For example, if B is on the same side of AE as D, then angle AEB would be less than angle AED.

But let's think numerically. In triangle ABE, angles sum to 180. So angle at B is 55°, angle at E is x, angle at A is y. So 55 + x + y = 180 → x + y = 125°.

If we can find y (angle at A in triangle ABE), which is angle BAE, then we can find x.

How to find angle BAE? If it's part of angle DAE (47°), then angle BAE = angle DAE - something. For instance, if AB is a continuation of AD, then angle BAE would be supplementary to angle DAE. Wait, if AB is a straight line from A through D to B, then angle BAE would be 180° - 47° = 133°, but that seems large. But then, in triangle ABE, angle at A would be 133°, leading to x = 125 - 133 = negative, which is impossible. So that can't be.

Alternatively, if point B is on the other side of AE relative to D. For example, imagine AE as a horizontal line, with D above it and B below it. Then, angle DAE is 47°, and angle BAE would be something else. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's still ambiguous.

Wait, but maybe there's another approach. Since angle AED is 57°, and angle ABE is 55°, maybe those are related through some triangle or transversal.

Wait, if we consider triangle ABE and triangle ADE. They share side AE. Perhaps using the Law of Sines in both triangles.

In triangle ADE: sides opposite angles are proportional to the sine of the angles. Let me denote:

In triangle ADE:

- angle at A: 47°, opposite side DE
- angle at E: 57°, opposite side AD
- angle at D: 76°, opposite side AE

So by the Law of Sines:

DE / sin(47°) = AD / sin(57°) = AE / sin(76°)

In triangle ABE:

- angle at B: 55°, opposite side AE
- angle at E: let's call it x
- angle at A: let's call it y

Law of Sines:

AE / sin(55°) = BE / sin(y) = AB / sin(x)

But without knowing any sides, this might not help directly. However, if we assume that certain sides are equal or relate to each other...

Alternatively, if we consider that in triangle ADE and triangle ABE, they share side AE. So maybe relating the ratios.

From triangle ADE:

DE / sin(47°) = AE / sin(76°)

From triangle ABE:

AE / sin(55°) = BE / sin(y)

But without more info, this might not lead anywhere.

Wait, but perhaps there's a way to link angle x (angle AEB) with angle AED (57°). If angle AEB is part of angle AED, then angle AEB + angle BED = angle AED = 57°. So if we can find angle BED, we can find angle AEB.

But angle BED is in triangle BED. If we can find angle at D in triangle BED, which is angle BDE. But angle BDE is part of angle ADE (76°), if B is on the same line as D. Wait, if B is on AD extended, then angle BDE would be supplementary to angle ADE. But again, this is speculative.

Alternatively, if we consider that angle BDE is part of triangle BDE. But without knowing more about triangle BDE, it's difficult.

Hmm. This is quite challenging without a diagram. Let me try to think differently. The question asks for angle 2. Since the options are 49, 55, 57, 76, and we already have 55 and 57 given, maybe angle 2 is 76°, which was calculated from triangle ADE. Or maybe it's 49°, which isn't directly given. 

Wait, if angle at D in triangle ADE is 76°, and if that's angle 2, then the answer would be D. But why would that be called angle 2?

Alternatively, maybe angle 2 is angle BEC. Let's assume that. How to calculate angle BEC.

If we consider triangle BEC. If we can find two angles, we can find the third. For example, angle at E (BEC), angle at B (EBC), angle at C (ECB).

To find these, we need more info. But maybe we can relate them to other angles.

Earlier, we had in triangle ABE: angles at B=55°, at E=x, at A=y, with x+y=125°.

If we can find x (angle AEB), then angle AEB is x, and angle AED is 57°, so if angle AEB is part of angle AED, then angle BED = 57° - x.

But angle BED is part of triangle BED. If we can find angle at D in triangle BED, which is angle BDE. If we assume that angle BDE is the same as angle ADE (76°), but that would only be true if B is aligned in a certain way. 

Alternatively, if points B and C are such that BC is parallel to AD or something, creating alternate interior angles. But without knowing, this is guesswork.

Wait, another idea: since angle ABE is 55°, and angle AED is 57°, perhaps there's a triangle where these angles are used. For example, if we consider triangle ABE and triangle ECD, or something similar.

Alternatively, maybe using exterior angles. For example, in triangle ABE, angle at E (x) is an external angle to some other triangle.

This is really tough. Maybe I need to consider that the answer is 76°, which was the third angle in triangle ADE, and that's angle 2. So choosing D.

But why would that be angle 2? Maybe angle 2 is the angle at D in triangle ADE, which is 76°. So Final Answer: D.
