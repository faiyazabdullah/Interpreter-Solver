MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So the question says that angle 1 is 50 degrees and angle 3 is 60 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle 4. But first, I need to visualize the diagram based on the given predicates. Let me list out all the points and lines mentioned.

Points: W, B, C, H, L, P, D, T, R, Q, A, G, S, E, K, M, F, Z, J, K, maybe others? Wait, the points listed are up to K, M, F, Z... Hmm, but the lines are j,k; m,n; p,q; H,L; W,T; R,Q; E,Z; M,H; K,L. Also angles like Angle(W,B,C); Angle(C,H,L); Angle(S,P,D); Angle(C,E,Z); Angle(E,F,K); Angle(B,S,E); Angle(A,R,G); Angle(F,Q,K); Angle(E,S,G); Angle(K,G,L); Angle(A,D,W); Angle(M,C,P). And there are some relations: Parallel(Line(j,k), Line(m,n)); Parallel(Line(W,T), Line(R,Q)); Perpendicular(Line(H,L), Line(W,T)).

Wait, but how do these relate to the angles mentioned? The problem mentions angles 1, 3, and 4. Since the user hasn't provided a diagram, I have to infer based on standard angle labeling. Typically, in such problems, angles are labeled sequentially, so maybe angle 1 and angle 3 are part of a triangle or intersecting lines?

But since the given angles involve various points, perhaps we need to look for triangles where these angles could be located. For example, Angle(W,B,C) is at point B, between points W and C. Similarly, Angle(C,H,L) is at point H. Maybe these angles are parts of different triangles connected through other lines.

Also, there are several parallel and perpendicular lines. For instance, Line(H,L) is perpendicular to Line(W,T). That means those two lines form a right angle where they intersect. Also, Line(W,T) is parallel to Line(R,Q). So if Line(W,T) is perpendicular to Line(H,L), then Line(R,Q) would also be perpendicular to Line(H,L), because parallel lines maintain the same angles with transversals.

Now, looking at the angles given: m∠1=50° and m∠3=60°. Need to find ∠4. Without seeing the diagram, it's tricky, but maybe these angles are part of a triangle or a set of intersecting lines with transversals.

Let me think about possible scenarios. Suppose angle 1 and angle 3 are corresponding angles due to parallel lines. For example, if two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal. Alternatively, if there's a triangle with some known angles.

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 and angle 3 are in a triangle where angle 4 is another angle. For example, if three angles sum to 180°, then angle 4 could be found via subtraction. But without knowing which angles are involved, this is challenging.

Another possibility: if there are vertical angles or supplementary angles. For instance, if two lines intersect, opposite angles are equal, adjacent angles are supplementary.

Wait, considering the perpendicular lines. Line(H,L) is perpendicular to Line(W,T), so they meet at a right angle. Let's say their intersection is at point H or T? Wait, Line(H,L) connects H and L, and Line(W,T) connects W and T. If they're perpendicular, they must intersect at some point. But the points mentioned are H, L, W, T. So maybe they intersect at point T? Or H?

Wait, Line(H,L) is from H to L. Line(W,T) is from W to T. Are these lines intersecting? If they are perpendicular, then they must intersect at a point. Let's suppose they intersect at point T? Because T is an endpoint of Line(W,T). So if Line(W,T) ends at T, and Line(H,L) passes through T? Then the intersection point would be T. Therefore, at point T, the lines H-L and W-T are perpendicular, forming a right angle.

So, at point T, there's a right angle between lines H-L and W-T. Now, if there are other lines passing through T, maybe creating angles 1 and 3.

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 and angle 3 are part of a triangle formed by these lines. For example, if there's a triangle involving points W, B, C, with angle at B being angle 1 (50°), and another triangle with angle 3 (60°), leading to angle 4 somewhere.

Alternatively, consider the angles given in the predicates. For example, Angle(W,B,C)=50°, which would be angle at B between W and C. Similarly, Angle(C,H,L)=60°, which is angle at H between C and L. These might be angles in triangles that share sides or are connected through other lines.

Looking at the lines: Line(M,H) connects M and H. Line(K,L) connects K and L. Also, Line(H,L) connects H and L. So points H, L, K, M might form some structure. Maybe a quadrilateral or triangle.

Given that Line(H,L) is perpendicular to Line(W,T), which is parallel to Line(R,Q). So Line(R,Q) is parallel to Line(W,T), and both are perpendicular to Line(H,L). This suggests that Line(R,Q) is also perpendicular to Line(H,L).

Additionally, there are several angles defined. For example, Angle(B,S,E) and Angle(E,S,G) might be part of a triangle involving points B, S, E, G.

But without a diagram, it's challenging. However, the key here is that angles 1 and 3 are given, and angle 4 needs to be found. Assuming that angles 1 and 3 are consecutive or related through some geometric property.

Let me think about common configurations. If two lines intersect, they form vertical angles. If there are parallel lines with a transversal, then corresponding or alternate interior angles could be equal. Also, in a triangle, the sum of angles is 180°.

Suppose angle 1 and angle 3 are angles in a triangle. Let's say angle 1 is one angle, angle 3 is another, then angle 4 would be the third angle. But then angle 4 would be 180 - 50 - 60 = 70°, which is option D. But wait, that's assuming they are in a triangle. However, the problem states m∠1 = 50 and m∠3 = 60. If they are two angles in a triangle, then angle 4 would be 70. But why would they be in a triangle?

Alternatively, if angle 1 and angle 3 are supplementary, then angle 4 could be their difference. But without knowing their relationship, it's hard to tell.

Wait, another thought: if there are two intersecting lines forming vertical angles, and angle 1 and angle 3 are vertical angles, then they would be equal. But since they are given as 50 and 60, that's not possible. So they must be adjacent or something else.

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 and angle 3 are part of a linear pair, making them supplementary. But again, without knowing their configuration, it's unclear.

Alternatively, considering the perpendicular lines. If Line(H,L) is perpendicular to Line(W,T), then they form four right angles at their intersection. Suppose angle 1 is one of those right angles, but that doesn't fit the given measures. Alternatively, angle 1 could be formed by another transversal.

Wait, let's check the angles given in the predicates. There's Angle(B,S,E) and Angle(E,S,G). If those angles are part of a triangle involving points B, S, E, G. Maybe angle 1 is Angle(B,S,E)=50°, and angle 3 is Angle(E,S,G)=60°, then angle 4 could be another angle in that triangle or elsewhere.

For example, if we have triangle ESG with angles at S, E, G. If Angle(B,S,E)=50° (at S), Angle(E,S,G)=60° (at S?), wait, no. Wait, Angle(E,S,G) would be at point S between E and G. So if we have points E-S-G, then angle at S is between E and G. But if there's another angle at S, maybe angle BSE and angle ESG are adjacent, forming a larger angle. But without more info, it's tough.

Alternatively, if angle 1 is part of a triangle with angle 3, and angle 4 is an external angle. In that case, the external angle equals the sum of the remote interior angles. So if angle 1 is 50 and angle 3 is 60, then angle 4 would be 50+60=110, which isn't among the options. So that's not matching.

Wait, but the options are 40, 50, 60, 70. So 70 is an option. If the sum of angles in a triangle gives 70, that fits. So if angle 1 and angle 3 are two angles in a triangle, then angle 4 is the third. But then 180 - 50 -60 = 70. Which would be option D. But why would those two angles be in a triangle?

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 and angle 3 are adjacent angles forming a straight line, making them supplementary. So if angle 1 is 50, then angle 3 would be 130, but the given is 60. Doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe angle 4 is part of a triangle where angle 1 and angle 3 are other angles. For example, if there's a triangle with angles 50°, 60°, and x, then x would be 70°. That seems plausible.

But how to confirm? Let's see if there are any triangles in the given predicates. For example, Angle(W,B,C) is given, which is a triangle with vertices W, B, C. If angle at B is 50°, then maybe that's angle 1. Another angle given is Angle(C,H,L)=60°, which would be angle at H. Maybe those are angles in different triangles, but perhaps connected through other lines.

If there's a triangle that includes both angle 1 and angle 3, then angle 4 would be the remaining angle. But without knowing the exact configuration, this is speculative.

Alternatively, considering the parallel lines. Since Line(W,T) is parallel to Line(R,Q), and Line(H,L) is perpendicular to Line(W,T), so Line(H,L) is also perpendicular to Line(R,Q). This creates right angles at their intersections. If there's a transversal cutting through these lines, creating corresponding angles.

For example, if a line crosses Line(W,T) and Line(R,Q), forming angles that could be related to angles 1 and 3.

But again, without knowing where angles 1 and 3 are located, it's difficult. However, since the answer options include 70, which is 50 + 60 - 180? No, wait, 180 - 50 - 60 = 70. So if those two angles are in a triangle, angle 4 is 70. That seems likely.

Therefore, the answer might be D. 70 degrees.
