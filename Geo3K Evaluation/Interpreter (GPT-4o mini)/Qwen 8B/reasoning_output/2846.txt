====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a triangle ABC, right? And some given conditions. Let me start by writing down all the given information.

First, there's a RightAngle predicate for Angle(A,C,B). Wait, that means angle at point C between points A, C, B is a right angle. So triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at C. Then, another predicate says MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)) equals 30 degrees. Hmm, so angle at point B between points A, B, C is 30 degrees. 

Then, LengthOf(Line(A,C)) is 24 units. That's one leg of the right triangle. The other legs are Line(C,B) with length x and Line(A,B) with length y. But the question asks for y, which is the length of AB. 

So, let me sketch this mentally. Triangle ABC with right angle at C. So sides AC and BC are the legs, and AB is the hypotenuse. Wait, but wait, if the right angle is at C, then AC and BC are the legs, and AB is the hypotenuse. However, the given angle is at B, which is angle ABC. Since it's a right-angled triangle at C, the angles at A and B should add up to 90 degrees. Given that angle at B is 30 degrees, then angle at A would be 60 degrees. Because in a right-angled triangle, the two non-right angles add up to 90. 

So, angles: angle at C is 90°, angle at B is 30°, so angle at A is 60°. Now, we know side AC is 24. Which side is that? In triangle ABC, AC is one leg. Let me confirm: points A, C, B. So AC is from A to C, BC is from B to C, and AB is the hypotenuse. Therefore, AC and BC are the legs, AB is hypotenuse. 

Given that angle at B is 30°, so in triangle ABC, angle at B is 30°, right angle at C. So, in such a triangle, the sides are in a ratio corresponding to a 30-60-90 triangle. Remember, in a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides opposite those angles are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. Specifically, the side opposite 30° is the shortest one, then the side opposite 60°, then hypotenuse. 

Wait, in our case, angle at B is 30°, so the side opposite to angle B is AC. Because angle B is at vertex B, so the opposite side is AC. Wait, let me think again. In triangle ABC, each angle corresponds to the opposite side. So angle at A is opposite BC, angle at B is opposite AC, angle at C is opposite AB. 

Since angle at B is 30°, then the side opposite to it, which is AC, has length 24. So according to the 30-60-90 ratios, the side opposite 30° is half the hypotenuse. Wait, so if AC is opposite 30°, then AC is the shorter leg. Therefore, hypotenuse AB would be twice that, so 2*AC = 48. Wait, but then the other leg BC (opposite angle A which is 60°) would be AC * √3. So BC = 24√3. 

But wait, the problem states that LengthOf(Line(A,C)) is 24. So AC = 24. Then, if angle at B is 30°, then AC is opposite angle B, making it the shorter leg. So hypotenuse AB is 2*AC = 48. Therefore, AB (which is y) would be 48. But looking at the answer choices, D is 48. However, I need to check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I mixed up the sides. Let me verify.

Alternatively, perhaps angle at B being 30°, so the side adjacent to angle B is BC, and the hypotenuse is AB. Let me use trigonometry here. In triangle ABC, with right angle at C. So tan(angle at B) = opposite / adjacent. Opposite to angle B is AC, adjacent is BC. So tan(30°) = AC / BC. We know AC is 24, so tan(30°) = 24 / BC. Tan(30°) is 1/√3. Therefore:

1/√3 = 24 / BC → BC = 24 * √3. 

Then, to find AB, which is the hypotenuse, we can use Pythagoras: AB² = AC² + BC² = 24² + (24√3)² = 24² + 24² * 3 = 24² (1 + 3) = 24² * 4 → AB = 24 * 2 = 48. So yes, AB is 48. Therefore, y = 48, which is answer D. 

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't confuse the sides. Another way: since angle at B is 30°, then the hypotenuse is AB, and the side opposite 30° is AC. So in a 30-60-90 triangle, hypotenuse is twice the shorter leg. So if AC is the shorter leg (opposite 30°), then AB = 2*AC = 48. Hence, y = AB = 48. So answer D. 

But let me check again. Suppose angle at B is 30°, so the hypotenuse is AB. Then, the side opposite angle B is AC. So AC is opposite 30°, hence AC = (AB)/2. So AB = 2*AC = 2*24=48. Yes. Therefore, y is 48. So answer D.
