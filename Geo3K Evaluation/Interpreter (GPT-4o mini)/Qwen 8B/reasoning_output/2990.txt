MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out the measure of angle 8. The problem says that angle 1 is 50 degrees and angle 3 is 60 degrees. Hmm, since there's a figure mentioned, even though I can't see it, I need to assume standard configurations where these angles could be located. Usually, in such problems, angles are part of intersecting lines or maybe a transversal with parallel lines. Let me think about common scenarios.

First, if angles 1 and 3 are part of a transversal cutting through two parallel lines, they might be corresponding, alternate interior, or same-side interior angles. But without seeing the figure, I have to make educated guesses. Another possibility is that these angles are in a triangle or around a point. Wait, angle measures add up to certain totals depending on the configuration.

Let me consider the possibility that angles 1 and 3 are adjacent or vertical angles. For example, if angle 1 and angle 3 are vertical angles, they would be equal, but here they are 50 and 60, so that doesn't fit. So maybe they are supplementary? If they are consecutive interior angles, their sum would be 180. But 50 + 60 is 110, which isn't 180. That doesn't work either.

Another thought: perhaps these angles are part of a triangle. If angle 1 and angle 3 are two angles of a triangle, the third angle would be 180 - 50 - 60 = 70 degrees. But how does that relate to angle 8? Maybe angle 8 is an exterior angle? Exterior angles are equal to the sum of the remote interior angles. Wait, if angle 8 were an exterior angle, then it would be 50 + 60 = 110 degrees. That's one of the options, choice B. But I need to confirm if that's the case.

Alternatively, if angles 1 and 3 are in a different configuration. Suppose there are two intersecting lines forming vertical angles. If angle 1 is 50, its vertical angle would also be 50. Then angle 3 being 60 might be another pair. But again, how does angle 8 come into play?

Wait, maybe the figure involves a transversal with parallel lines. Let's say angle 1 and angle 3 are corresponding angles. But then they should be equal. Since they aren't, that's not the case. What if they are same-side interior angles? Then they'd be supplementary, adding to 180. But again, 50+60=110, which isn't 180. Not matching.

Another scenario: suppose angle 1 and angle 3 are angles formed by a transversal crossing two lines, and angle 8 is another angle in the diagram. Let me visualize a typical setup. Imagine two parallel lines cut by a transversal, creating eight angles. In such cases, we have various pairs of angles. If angle 1 is 50 degrees, then its corresponding angle would be 50, and alternate interior would also be 50. Similarly, angle 3 is 60, so maybe it's another set.

But angle 8... Depending on the position, angle 8 could be a vertical angle with another angle, or maybe an exterior angle. Let's try to map them. Suppose angle 1 is at the intersection of two lines, and angle 3 is another. If angle 1 is 50, then the opposite angle (vertical) is also 50. Angle 3 is 60, so its vertical angle is 60. Now, if angle 8 is an exterior angle, like the one outside the parallel lines, then it could be supplementary to one of the other angles. For example, if angle 8 is adjacent to angle 1, then it would be 180 - 50 = 130. But that's option D. Alternatively, if angle 8 is formed by extending a line, making it an exterior angle related to angle 3. Then 180 - 60 = 120, which is option C.

Hmm, conflicting possibilities. How do I decide? Wait, maybe angle 8 is a linear pair with angle 1 or angle 3. Or perhaps it's part of a triangle. Let me think again. If angle 1 and angle 3 are in a triangle, then angle 8 might be an external angle. Wait, earlier calculation suggested that if angle 8 is an exterior angle, then it's 50 + 60 = 110. Which is option B.

Alternatively, if angle 8 is vertically opposite to some combination. Wait, maybe the diagram has a more complex structure. Another possibility: angles 1 and 3 are in a pentagon or another polygon. But without knowing the exact figure, it's challenging.

Wait, perhaps the angles are in a star or a more complex shape. However, given the answer choices, 110 is a common result from exterior angles. Let me go back to the first idea where angle 8 is an exterior angle. If angle 1 and angle 3 are two remote interior angles, then the exterior angle would be their sum. Hence, 50 + 60 = 110. Therefore, the answer would be B.

Alternatively, if angle 8 is a vertical angle to the sum of those angles. But vertical angles are equal, so that wouldn't make sense unless the sum was split somehow. Wait, maybe angle 8 is supplementary to angle 1 or 3. But then 180 - 50 = 130 or 180 - 60 = 120. Both of which are options C and D. 

This uncertainty suggests I need to recall standard problems. Often, in such problems, when given two angles and asked for another, especially in a transversal setup, the exterior angle equals the sum of the remote interior angles. So if angle 8 is an exterior angle, then 50 + 60 = 110. Therefore, answer B. 

Alternatively, if the angles are part of a triangle with an exterior angle. For instance, if angle 1 and angle 3 are two angles of a triangle, then the third angle would be 70. Then the exterior angle would be 180 - 70 = 110. Again, same result. 

Therefore, I think the correct answer is B. 110 degrees.
