MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a parallelogram WXYZ. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in length. That's a key property I remember. The problem gives us some equations involving the lengths of the sides. Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right.

First, the LengthOf(Line(W,X)) equals b + 11. Then, LengthOf(Line(X,Y)) is 3a + 7. Next, LengthOf(Line(Y,Z)) is 2b, and finally, LengthOf(Line(W,Z)) is 4a. 

Since it's a parallelogram, opposite sides should be equal. So, side WX should be equal to side YZ, and side XY should be equal to side ZW. Wait, let me confirm the order of the points. The parallelogram is named W, X, Y, Z. So the sides are WX, XY, YZ, and ZW. Therefore, opposite sides would be WX and YZ, and XY and ZW. 

So according to the given lengths: WX = b + 11, YZ = 2b. Since they're opposite sides in a parallelogram, these should be equal. Therefore, setting them equal: b + 11 = 2b. Solving that would give 11 = b. But wait, let me check if there's another pair of opposite sides. Also, XY is 3a + 7, and ZW is 4a. So those two should also be equal. Therefore, 3a + 7 = 4a. Solving that gives 7 = a. 

Wait, so if I do that, then b would be 11? Let me verify. If b is 11, then WX is 11 + 11 = 22, and YZ is 2*11=22. That checks out. For the other pair, if a is 7, then XY is 3*7 +7 = 28, and ZW is 4*7=28. That works too. So then b is 11, which is option B. But let me make sure there isn't something I missed here. 

Is there any chance that the sides could be different? Like maybe adjacent sides? No, because in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. Adjacent sides are not necessarily equal unless it's a rhombus, but we don't know that here. So my initial thought seems correct. 

But let me double-check. Suppose I made a mistake in identifying which sides are opposite. Let me visualize the parallelogram. Points W, X, Y, Z. So connecting W to X, X to Y, Y to Z, Z back to W. So opposite sides are WX and YZ, and XY and ZW. Yes, that's correct. So the equations I set up are accurate. 

Therefore, solving the first equation: b + 11 = 2b → subtract b from both sides → 11 = b. And solving the second equation: 3a +7 =4a → subtract 3a → 7=a. Both equations are satisfied with these values. Thus, the answer for b is 11, which corresponds to option B. 

I don't see any other constraints or relationships that could affect this. All the given predicates are used here. The problem didn't mention anything about angles or diagonals, so there's no need to consider other properties. Just the fundamental property of opposite sides being equal in a parallelogram. 

Therefore, the correct answer should be B.
