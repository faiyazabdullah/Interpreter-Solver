Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a circle with center T. Points Z, V, Y, W are on the circle, and there's a point V connected to other points via lines. Also, there's a right angle at Angle(X,V,Y). The given lengths are ZV = 1 and TW = 13. We need to find XY.

First, I'll try to visualize the setup. Since all points Z, V, Y, W lie on the circle centered at T, that means TV, TZ, TY, TW are all radii of the circle. Wait, but TW is given as 13. Since T is the center, TW must be a radius. Therefore, the radius of the circle is 13. But wait, ZV is given as 1. Hmm, ZV is a segment connecting points Z and V, both on the circle. So ZV is a chord of the circle. 

Now, looking at the lines mentioned: Line(X,V), Line(V,Y), Line(V,Z), Line(V,W), and Line(T,W). Also, there's a right angle at Angle(X,V,Y). Let me sketch mentally. Point V is connected to X, Y, Z, and W. Also, T is connected to W. Since T is the center, TW is a radius, so TW = 13. 

Since V is connected to Z and W, maybe V lies somewhere inside or outside the circle? Wait, but if V is connected to Z and W, which are on the circle, then V could be inside or outside. However, since there's a right angle at V between X and Y. Maybe triangle XVY has a right angle at V. 

But how do these points relate? Let me think again. All points Z, Y, W are on the circle. So, points Z, Y, W are on the circumference. Then, V is connected to them. Also, there's a line from T to W, which is a radius. 

Wait, perhaps V is another point inside the circle? Because it's connected to Z, Y, W, and X. But X isn't necessarily on the circle. The problem says Point(V) exists, but doesn't specify where. 

Also, there's a right angle at Angle(X,V,Y). So, angle at V between X and Y is 90 degrees. That suggests that triangle XVY is right-angled at V. So, maybe we can use Pythagoras here. But to do that, we need some sides. 

We know ZV is 1. Since Z is on the circle, and V is connected to Z. So, ZV is a chord from Z to V. But since T is the center, and TW is a radius of length 13. So, the radius of the circle is 13. Therefore, TZ = TW = TY = TV = 13? Wait, no. Wait, V may not be on the circle. Because if V were on the circle, then TV would also be a radius. But ZV is given as 1. If V were on the circle, then ZV would be a chord, and the maximum distance between two points on the circle is the diameter, which is 26. But ZV is just 1, which is possible. However, if V is inside the circle, then ZV is a segment from a point inside to a point on the circle. 

But how do we know whether V is inside or outside? Well, since there's a line from V to Z, V to Y, V to W, and V to X. Also, the right angle at V involving X and Y. Maybe V is inside the circle? Let's assume that. 

So, considering that, since TW is a radius of 13, and V is connected to W. So, VW is a segment from V to W, which is a point on the circle. If V is inside the circle, then VW would be less than the radius. But we don't know its length yet. 

But we need to find XY. Given that angle at V is right, so triangle XVY is right-angled at V. Therefore, by Pythagoras, XY² = VX² + VY². But we need to find VX and VY. 

Alternatively, maybe there's some relation between the segments because of the circle. For example, power of a point. Since V is inside the circle, the product of the segments of intersecting chords. For instance, if a line passes through V and intersects the circle at two points, say Z and another point, then VZ * VZ' = power of V. Wait, but we have points Z and W connected to V. Wait, but Z and W are both on the circle. So, if line VZ intersects the circle at Z and another point, but since Z is already one intersection, maybe there's another point. Similarly for line VW. 

Wait, but we only have one point on each line. Unless those lines pass through another point on the circle. Let me think. Since line VZ connects V to Z, which is on the circle. If V is inside the circle, then line VZ extends beyond Z to another point on the circle. But unless specified, we don't know. However, maybe there's something else. 

Alternatively, consider that since T is the center, and W is on the circle, so TW = 13. Also, line TV connects T to V. If we can find the distance from V to T, maybe we can use power of a point. 

Power of a point V with respect to circle T is equal to VZ * VZ' = VW * VW', where Z' and W' are the second intersections of lines VZ and VW with the circle. However, without knowing where those other points are, this might not be directly helpful. 

But maybe we can consider that since Z and W are points on the circle, then TZ = TW = 13. Let me note that. 

Let me consider coordinates. Maybe placing T at the origin to simplify. Suppose T is at (0,0). Then, W is a point on the circle, so coordinates of W satisfy x² + y² = 13². Let me assign coordinates to make things easier. Suppose W is at (13,0), since TW is along the x-axis. Then, coordinates of T are (0,0), W is (13,0). Now, point V is connected to W, so line VW goes from V to W. Also, V is connected to Z, Y, and X. 

But without more info on where V is, this might be tricky. However, there's a right angle at V between X and Y. So, angle XVY is 90°, implying that vectors VX and VY are perpendicular. 

Alternatively, since V is connected to Z and W, and Z is another point on the circle. Let me think about triangle TVZ. Since T is the center, TZ is radius 13, and VZ is 1. So, in triangle TVZ, we have sides TV, TZ=13, and ZV=1. Using the law of cosines, maybe?

Yes! In triangle TVZ, applying the Law of Cosines:

TV² + TZ² - 2*TV*TZ*cos(angle at T) = ZV²

Wait, but we don't know angle at T. Alternatively, since T is the center, and Z is on the circle, then TZ is radius 13. If we can find TV, then we can relate it. But we don't know TV. 

Alternatively, since V is connected to W, which is also on the circle. So, line VW connects V to W, which is on the circle. So, if we can find the length of VW, but we don't have that. However, if we can relate TV and VW using power of a point. 

Power of point V with respect to circle T is equal to VT² - r², but wait, no. Power of a point inside the circle is negative, and equals -(distance from V to center squared minus radius squared)? Wait, actually, the formula is: for a point V inside the circle, the power is equal to - (VT² - r²), but more importantly, for any chord passing through V, the product of the distances from V to the two ends of the chord is equal. 

So, for line VZ, since Z is on the circle, the other intersection point with the circle would be another point, say Z'. Then, VZ * VZ' = power of V. Similarly for line VW, if line VW intersects the circle again at W', then VW * VW' = same power. 

But since we don't know Z' or W', maybe we can express these products. However, without knowing where Z' and W' are, it's hard to proceed. 

But perhaps if we take line VZ and line VW. Suppose line VZ intersects the circle at Z and Z', and line VW intersects the circle at W and W'. Then, VZ * VZ' = VW * VW'. 

But we only know VZ = 1. If we can find VZ', then we can write equations. But how? 

Alternatively, since Z is on the circle, then TZ = 13. So, in triangle TVZ, we have sides TZ = 13, VZ = 1, and TV is unknown. So, using the Law of Cosines:

TZ² = TV² + VZ² - 2*TV*VZ*cos(theta), where theta is angle at V between TV and VZ. Wait, but that seems complicated. 

Alternatively, maybe using coordinates. Let me place T at (0,0), W at (13,0). Let me suppose that V has coordinates (a,b). Then, since Z is another point on the circle. Let me denote Z as some point (x,y) on the circle, so x² + y² = 13². The distance between V(a,b) and Z(x,y) is 1: sqrt[(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2] = 1 => (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = 1. 

Additionally, line VZ connects V(a,b) to Z(x,y). Also, line VW connects V(a,b) to W(13,0). 

Moreover, there's a right angle at V between X and Y. So, points X and Y are such that angle XVY is 90 degrees. This implies that vectors VX and VY are perpendicular. 

But without knowing where X and Y are, except that they are connected to V. Perhaps X and Y are points on the circle? Or maybe not? The problem mentions Point(X) and Point(Y), but doesn't specify they're on the circle. However, since there are lines from V to X and V to Y, and the right angle at V, maybe X and Y are points such that VX and VY are perpendicular. 

But how does this relate to the rest? Maybe triangle XVY being right-angled at V, and needing to find XY. 

Wait, if we can find VX and VY, then XY^2 = VX^2 + VY^2. So, if we can find VX and VY, then compute XY. 

But how to find VX and VY? 

Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between VX and VY due to the circle. For example, if X and Y are points on the circle, then VX and VY would be chords from V to the circle. But since V is inside the circle, then VX and VY are segments from V to points on the circle. 

But we don't have explicit info on X and Y. However, since there's a right angle at V between X and Y, perhaps we can use the property that for a point inside a circle, the sum of squares of the distances from the point to two points on the circle relates to something... Not sure. 

Wait, but if angle XVY is 90°, then by the converse of Thales' theorem, if X and Y are on the circle with center T, then maybe there's some relation. Wait, but V is not necessarily the center. 

Alternatively, consider the circle with center T, and V inside. For any chord through V, the product of the segments is constant. 

Wait, going back to the power of a point. For point V inside the circle, power = VT² - r², but since it's inside, power is negative. Wait, the actual formula is that for any chord passing through V, the product of the lengths from V to the endpoints is equal to r² - OT², where O is the center. Wait, more accurately, power of point V with respect to circle T is equal to |VT|² - r², but since V is inside, it's negative. And for any chord passing through V, the product of the segments is equal to -(power). So, for example, for chord VZ, the product VZ * VZ' = r² - |VT|². 

Similarly for chord VW, VW * VW' = r² - |VT|². 

So, if I can find expressions for VZ * VZ' and VW * VW', but I only know VZ = 1. So, assuming that Z is one endpoint of the chord, then VZ * VZ' = r² - |VT|². 

So, VZ * VZ' = 1 * VZ' = 13² - |VT|². Hence, VZ' = 13² - |VT|². 

Similarly, for line VW, if W is one endpoint, then VW * VW' = 13² - |VT|². 

But we don't know VW. However, if we can relate VZ' and VW', maybe through other relations. 

But how does this help us? Let me think. If I can find |VT|, then I can find VZ' and VW', but how? 

Alternatively, since we have two different chords through V: VZ and VW. So, for both chords, the product is the same. Thus, VZ * VZ' = VW * VW'. 

But we only know VZ = 1. So, 1 * VZ' = VW * VW'. 

But we don't know VW or VZ' or VW'. 

However, maybe there's another way. Suppose we consider that line VZ intersects the circle at Z and Z', and line VW intersects at W and W'. Then, if we can find relations between these points. 

But without more information, this seems stuck. 

Wait, but maybe there's more information in the diagram. The problem includes Point(X), Line(X,V), Line(V,Y), and the right angle at V. So, maybe X and Y are points on the circle? Because otherwise, there's no connection to the circle. 

Assuming X and Y are on the circle, then VX and VY are chords from V to the circle. So, their lengths would be related to the power of point V. 

For example, VX * VX' = power, where VX' is the other segment. But since X is on the circle, VX * VX' = r² - |VT|². 

But since angle at V is 90°, maybe we can use the fact that in right triangle XVY, the hypotenuse XY is related to VX and VY. 

So, XY² = VX² + VY². 

But if VX and VY are chords from V to the circle, then VX = sqrt(r² - |VT|² + ... ? No, wait. The length of a chord from V to the circle depends on the distance from V to the center. 

Actually, the length of a chord from a point V inside the circle to a point X on the circle can be found using the formula:

Length of chord = 2 * sqrt(r² - d²), where d is the distance from the center to the point V. Wait, no. Wait, the length of the chord depends on the angle subtended at the center. 

Alternatively, for a single chord from V to X, the length would depend on the position of X relative to V. 

But if we consider that for any chord through V, the product of the segments is fixed. So, for example, for chord VX, which goes from V to X, then VX * VX' = r² - |VT|². But if X is one endpoint, then VX' is the extension of the line VX beyond X to the other side of the circle. 

However, without knowing where X is, this might not help directly. 

But since there's a right angle at V between X and Y, maybe there's a relation between the lengths of VX and VY. 

Let me consider that. Suppose we have two chords VX and VY from point V inside the circle, making a right angle at V. Then, using the Pythagorean theorem, XY² = VX² + VY². 

But how to find VX and VY? 

Alternatively, using coordinate geometry. Assume T is at (0,0), W is at (13,0). Let me set up coordinates. Let’s say V is at (a,b). Then, the power of V with respect to the circle is |VT|² - r² = a² + b² - 13². Since V is inside the circle, this should be negative. 

For any chord passing through V, like VX and VY, the product of the segments is equal to the power. So, for example, if VX is a chord from V to X, then VX * VX' = power. But since X is on the circle, the segment VX is part of that chord. However, without knowing where X is, it's unclear. 

But if we consider that angle XVY is 90°, then vectors VX and VY are perpendicular. So, if we can express VX and VY in terms of coordinates. 

Let me suppose that point X is (x1, y1) and Y is (x2, y2), both on the circle, so x1² + y1² = 13² and x2² + y2² = 13². The vector VX is (x1 - a, y1 - b), and vector VY is (x2 - a, y2 - b). These vectors are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero:

(x1 - a)(x2 - a) + (y1 - b)(y2 - b) = 0. 

But this seems too general. How can we connect this with other information? 

We also know that ZV = 1. Assuming Z is a point on the circle, so coordinates (z_x, z_y), with z_x² + z_y² = 13². The distance between V(a,b) and Z(z_x, z_y) is 1:

sqrt((z_x - a)^2 + (z_y - b)^2) = 1 → (z_x - a)^2 + (z_y - b)^2 = 1. 

This gives another equation. 

But this seems too many variables. Maybe there's a smarter way. 

Let me think again about the power of point V. For any chord through V, the product of the segments is equal. So, for example, for chord VZ, the product VZ * VZ' = power. Similarly for chord VW. 

Let’s denote power = k = r² - |VT|². Wait, no. Actually, the power of point V is equal to the square of the tangent length from V to the circle, which is equal to r² - |VT|². And for any secant line through V, the product of the segments is equal to this value. 

So, for example, if a secant line passes through V and intersects the circle at A and B, then VA * VB = r² - |VT|². 

So, for line VZ, which passes through V and Z, and since Z is on the circle, then VZ * VZ' = r² - |VT|². Here, Z' is the other intersection point of line VZ with the circle. 

Similarly, for line VW, which passes through V and W, and since W is on the circle, then VW * VW' = r² - |VT|². 

But we know VZ = 1. Let's call VZ = 1, so the product VZ * VZ' = 1 * VZ' = r² - |VT|². Therefore, VZ' = r² - |VT|². 

Similarly, for line VW, if we let VW = m, then VW * VW' = m * VW' = r² - |VT|². So, VW' = (r² - |VT|²)/m. 

But how does this help us? 

Maybe we can find another expression for VW. 

Wait, but we don't know VW. However, we might relate it to something else. 

Wait, but we also have the right angle at V between X and Y. Let me think. If X and Y are points on the circle, then VX and VY are two chords from V to the circle, forming a right angle. 

Using the formula for the angle between two chords from a point inside the circle. There's a formula relating the angle between two chords to the arcs they subtend. 

The angle between two chords from a point V inside the circle is equal to half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. 

So, angle XVY = ½ ( arc XY - arc XWY ) or something like that. Wait, more precisely, the measure of the angle formed by two chords from V is equal to half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. 

But in our case, angle XVY is 90°, so:

angle XVY = ½ ( arc XY - arc XWY ) = 90°. Wait, I need to recall the exact formula. 

Actually, if two chords VA and VB form an angle at V, then the measure of angle AVB is equal to ½ ( measure of arc AB - measure of arc CD ), where CD is the opposite arc. Wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. 

Actually, the measure of an angle formed by two chords at a point inside the circle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. Wait, no, that's for an angle outside. Wait, let me check. 

When the vertex is inside the circle, the measure of the angle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. Wait, no, that's when it's outside. 

Wait, according to the circle theorems:

- An angle formed by two chords at a point on the circle: it's half the measure of the intercepted arc.

- An angle formed by two secants at a point outside the circle: it's half the difference of the intercepted arcs.

- An angle formed by two secants at a point inside the circle: it's half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. 

Wait, yes! So, if the angle is formed at a point inside the circle, it's half the sum of the intercepted arcs. 

So, in this case, angle XVY is formed at V inside the circle, and intercepts arcs XWY and something? Wait, the angle at V intercepts arcs between X and Y. Wait, actually, the two intercepted arcs would be the arc from X to Y passing through one side and the arc passing through the other side. 

But since angle XVY is formed by chords VX and VY, the measure of angle XVY is equal to ½ (arc XY + arc XWY) or something like that. Wait, more accurately, the angle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. 

But since the entire circle is 360°, the two intercepted arcs add up to 360°, but angle XVY is 90°, so:

angle XVY = ½ (arc XY + arc XWY) = 90° 

Wait, but I think I'm getting confused. Let me look up the exact formula. 

Actually, when the vertex is inside the circle, the measure of the angle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. So, angle XVY intercepts arcs XWY and XZY? Or what? 

Actually, the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are opposite to the angle. For angle at V formed by VX and VY, the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are cut off by the points X and Y. Specifically, the angle is equal to half the sum of the arcs intercepted by the angle and its vertical opposite. 

Wait, perhaps it's simpler to think that the measure of angle XVY is equal to half the sum of the measures of the arcs that are intercepted by the pairs of points. 

But maybe this is not helpful without knowing the arcs. 

Alternatively, if angle XVY is 90°, then:

angle XVY = ½ ( arc XWY + arc XZ Y ) = 90° ?

Not sure. Maybe this approach is too vague. 

Let me try another angle. Since angle XVY is 90°, and V is inside the circle, perhaps there's a relationship between the lengths VX and VY. 

From earlier, we had that for any chord through V, the product of the segments is equal to power = r² - |VT|². 

So, for chord VX, let's say it intersects the circle at X and X', then VX * VX' = r² - |VT|². Similarly for chord VY: VY * VY' = r² - |VT|². 

But since angle XVY is 90°, and VX and VY are perpendicular, maybe there's a way to relate VX and VY. 

But how? Let me think. Suppose that VX and VY are two perpendicular chords from V. Then, if we denote the power as k = r² - |VT|², then for each chord, the product of the segments is k. 

So, for chord VX, let's say it has length s, then s * s' = k, where s' is the other segment. Similarly for VY, length t, t * t' = k. 

But since angle between them is 90°, maybe there's a relation between s and t. 

But I'm not seeing it directly. 

Wait, but in the right triangle XVY, we have XY² = VX² + VY². 

If we can express VX and VY in terms of k. Let's assume that for each chord, the length from V to the point on the circle is l, then the other segment is k/l. 

But the total length of the chord from X to X' would be VX + VX' = l + k/l. 

But how does this relate to the length of VX? It depends on where X is. 

Alternatively, if we consider that for any chord passing through V, the length from V to the circle is l, then l satisfies l * (l + something) = k. 

But without knowing the direction of the chord, it's difficult to relate l to other parameters. 

Hmm. This seems stuck. Let me think differently. 

Given that ZV = 1 and TW = 13. Since TW is a radius, TW = 13. Also, Z is on the circle, so TZ = 13. So, in triangle TVZ, we have TZ = 13, VZ = 1, and TV is some value. 

Applying the Law of Cosines on triangle TVZ:

TZ² = TV² + VZ² - 2 * TV * VZ * cos(theta), where theta is angle at V. 

But we don't know theta. However, if we can relate this to other parts. 

Wait, but if we consider that line VW is another chord from V to W, which is on the circle, so TW = 13. So, similarly, in triangle TVW, we have TW = 13, TV is the same as before, and VW is some length. 

But again, without knowing the angle, this might not help. 

Wait, but maybe combining both triangles TVZ and TVW. Let me write down the equations:

For triangle TVZ: 

TZ² = TV² + VZ² - 2 * TV * VZ * cos(theta1)

Where theta1 is the angle at V between TV and VZ.

For triangle TVW: 

TW² = TV² + VW² - 2 * TV * VW * cos(theta2)

Where theta2 is the angle at V between TV and VW.

But without knowing theta1 or theta2, this seems unmanageable. 

But maybe there's a relation between theta1 and theta2? If we can find some relation between the angles, but I don't see it. 

Alternatively, since V is connected to Z, Y, W, and X, and there's a right angle at V between X and Y. Maybe these lines are related to the radius or something. 

Wait, but I'm running out of ideas. Let me try to consider specific cases. 

Suppose that V is the midpoint of TW. Wait, but TW is 13, so if V is the midpoint, then TV would be 6.5. But then ZV = 1, so the distance from V to Z is 1. But how does this help? 

Alternatively, maybe V is located such that TV is perpendicular to ZV. But this is speculative. 

Wait, another idea: since angle XVY is 90°, and X and Y are points on the circle, then the circle with diameter XY would have its center at the midpoint of XY and would pass through V. But since V is inside the original circle, this might not hold. 

But if V lies on the circle with diameter XY, then XVY is a right angle. So, XY is the diameter of this new circle. 

But how does this relate to the original circle? 

Alternatively, since V is inside the original circle, and lies on the circle with diameter XY, then the distance from V to the center of this new circle (midpoint of XY) is equal to half of XY times cos(theta), but I'm not sure. 

But this seems too abstract. 

Wait, let's go back to the power of point V. We know that for any chord through V, the product of the segments is equal to k = r² - |VT|². 

Let's assume that V is such that there are two perpendicular chords through it, VX and VY. Then, the product for each chord is k. 

Let me denote the lengths from V to X and V to Y as a and b respectively. So, VX = a, VY = b. Then, since they are perpendicular, the length XY would be sqrt(a² + b²). 

But also, for each chord, the product of the segments is k. So, for chord VX, which has length a, the other segment is (k / a). So, the total length of the chord from X to X' is a + (k/a). Similarly for VY: b + (k/b). 

But without knowing where X and Y are, it's hard to relate a and b. 

But perhaps there's a relation between a and b. Since angle between them is 90°, maybe there's a relation between a and b. 

Alternatively, since both a and b are lengths from V to the circle, and the product for each is k, then:

a * (length from V to other end of chord) = k

Similarly for b.

But unless we have more constraints, it's still unclear. 

Wait, but we also know that ZV = 1. So, if Z is a point on the circle, then the product VZ * VZ' = k. So, since VZ = 1, then VZ' = k / 1 = k. So, VZ' = k. 

Therefore, the length from V to Z is 1, and from V to Z' (the other end of the chord) is k. So, the full length of the chord ZZ' is 1 + k. 

Similarly, for line VW, if we let VW = m, then VW' = k/m, so the full length WW' is m + k/m. 

But how to find k? 

Well, k = r² - |VT|². So, if we can find |VT|, then we can find k. 

But how to find |VT|? 

Let me consider that V is connected to Z and W. From earlier, in triangle TVZ, we have sides TV, TZ = 13, VZ = 1. So, using the Law of Cosines:

TZ² = TV² + VZ² - 2 * TV * VZ * cos(theta), where theta is angle at V between TV and VZ.

So, 13² = TV² + 1² - 2 * TV * 1 * cos(theta).

But this introduces an unknown angle theta. Similarly for triangle TVW. 

But unless we can relate theta to something else, this might not help. 

Wait, but if we assume that the angle between TV and VZ is the same as between TV and VW? No, that's not necessarily true. 

Alternatively, if we assume that TV is perpendicular to ZV, then cos(theta) = 0. Let's test this assumption. 

If angle at V between TV and VZ is 90°, then cos(theta) = 0. So,

13² = TV² + 1 - 0 → TV² = 169 - 1 = 168 → TV = sqrt(168) = 2*sqrt(42). 

Then, k = r² - |VT|² = 13² - 168 = 169 - 168 = 1. 

So, k = 1. 

Then, for line VW, which has length m, then VW * VW' = k = 1. So, if VW is m, then VW' = 1/m. 

But what is m? 

Wait, but we don't know m. However, if we consider that line VW passes through W, which is on the circle. So, the length from V to W is m, and from V to W' is 1/m. 

But since W is on the circle, the full length of the chord WW' is m + 1/m. 

But without knowing anything about this chord, it's still unclear. 

But if k = 1, then for any chord through V, the product of the segments is 1. So, for example, for the chord VZ, which has VZ = 1 and VZ' = 1, so the full length of the chord is 2. 

Similarly, for chord VW, if VW = m, then VW' = 1/m, so full length is m + 1/m. 

But how does this help us? 

But we also have the right angle at V between X and Y. So, if we consider that VX and VY are two chords through V, each with product of segments equal to 1. So, for example, if VX = a, then the other segment is 1/a. So, the full length of the chord is a + 1/a. 

And similarly for VY = b, full length is b + 1/b. 

But since angle between VX and VY is 9 0°, and XY^2 = a^2 + b^2. 

But we need to find XY. 

But how to find a and b? 

Wait, but we also know that ZV = 1, which is one of the chords. So, for example, if ZV = 1, then the other segment of that chord is 1, so the full length is 2. 

But how does this relate to a and b? 

Unless there's a relation between a and b. 

Wait, but if we consider that the two chords VX and VY are perpendicular, and their products are 1, then perhaps there's a relation between a and b. 

Let me think. If VX = a, then the other segment is 1/a, so the full length of the chord is a + 1/a. Similarly for VY = b. 

But since angle between VX and VY is 90°, perhaps the vectors VX and VY are perpendicular. 

But how does this relate to a and b? 

It's still unclear. 

But maybe there's a minimum or maximum condition. For example, the minimum value of a + 1/a is 2, achieved when a = 1. 

But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, since the product of the segments is 1, and we want to find XY, which is sqrt(a² + b²). 

But how to relate a and b? 

Wait, but we also know that there's another chord ZV with length 1. So, in this scenario, if ZV = 1, then the product of the segments is 1, so VZ * VZ' = 1 * VZ' = 1 → VZ' = 1. So, the full length of the chord is 1 + 1 = 2. 

But what is the length of the chord ZV? It's 1, which is given. 

But how does this help? 

Maybe there's a way to relate a and b to this. 

Alternatively, since V is inside the circle, and there are multiple chords through V, each with product of segments equal to 1. 

But this seems to suggest that k = 1, which came from assuming that angle between TV and VZ was 90°. 

If that's the case, then k = 1. 

So, if k = 1, then for any chord through V, the product of the segments is 1. 

Now, for the right angle at V between X and Y, which are two chords from V, each with product of segments equal to 1. So, for example, for VX = a, then the other segment is 1/a. Similarly for VY = b, other segment is 1/b. 

But since angle between VX and VY is 90°, and we need to find XY. 

But how? 

Maybe we can use the fact that for any two perpendicular chords through V, there's a relation between their lengths. 

Wait, but without more information, it's hard to say. 

But if we assume that VX and VY are such that their lengths are a and b, then XY^2 = a^2 + b^2. 

But also, since each of these chords has product of segments equal to 1, we have:

For VX: a * (other segment) = 1 → other segment = 1/a. So, the full length of the chord is a + 1/a. 

Similarly for VY: b + 1/b. 

But how does this help? 

Wait, but the full length of the chord for VX is a + 1/a, which is the distance from X to X', passing through V. 

But we don't know where X is. 

However, if we consider that the maximum possible length of such a chord would be the diameter of the circle, which is 26. So, a + 1/a ≤ 26. 

But this might not help. 

Wait, but if we consider that the minimum value of a + 1/a is 2, achieved when a = 1. 

But how does this help? 

Perhaps there's a constraint from the given data. 

Wait, we also know that TW = 13, and W is on the circle. So, the line VW passes through W, which is on the circle. So, for this chord VW, the product of the segments is 1. 

So, VW * VW' = 1. 

Let me denote VW as m, then VW' = 1/m. 

But since W is on the circle, the full length of the chord WW' is m + 1/m. 

But the maximum length of a chord is 26, so m + 1/m ≤ 26. 

But this is always true since m > 0. 

But how to find m? 

Wait, but if we can relate m to something else. 

But we don't have direct info about VW. 

Wait, but if we consider that line VW passes through W, which is on the circle, and V is inside the circle. So, the length VW is the distance from V to W, which is a segment from V to the circle. 

So, the length VW is the distance from V to W, which is part of the chord. 

But we don't know it. 

But if we assume that k = 1, as derived earlier under the assumption that angle between TV and VZ is 90°, then this would mean that for any chord through V, the product of the segments is 1. 

But how did we get k = 1? By assuming that in triangle TVZ, the angle at V is 90°, leading to TV² = 168, hence k = 1. 

But this assumption may not be valid. 

Wait, but if we don't make that assumption, how else can we find k? 

We need another equation. 

But we only have one equation from triangle TVZ: 13² = TV² + 1² - 2 * TV * 1 * cos(theta). 

Without knowing theta, we cannot solve for TV. 

But maybe there's another relation from the right angle at V. 

If angle XVY is 90°, and assuming that k = r² - |VT|², and that for the two perpendicular chords VX and VY, their products are k. 

But how to relate this? 

Let me consider that for two perpendicular chords from V, the product of their segments is k. 

But I'm not finding a direct relationship. 

Wait, here's an idea. If we consider the two perpendicular chords VX and VY, each with product of segments equal to k. Then, the lengths of VX and VY can be arbitrary as long as their products are k. 

But since we need to find XY, which is sqrt(VX² + VY²), and we don't know VX and VY, unless there's a constraint. 

But we also know that ZV = 1. Which is another chord from V to Z, with product of segments equal to k. So, VZ * VZ' = k. Since VZ = 1, then VZ' = k. 

So, the length of the full chord ZZ' is 1 + k. 

But since Z is on the circle, the maximum possible length of this chord is 26 (diameter). So, 1 + k ≤ 26 → k ≤ 25. 

But we also know that k = r² - |VT|² = 169 - |VT|². 

But without knowing |VT|, we can't determine k. 

But if we can relate k to something else. 

Wait, but we also have line VW, which is a chord from V to W, with product VW * VW' = k. 

If we can find VW in terms of |VT|. 

Let me consider that line VW passes through W, which is on the circle. So, the length from V to W is m, and from V to W' is k/m. 

But since W is on the circle, the full length of the chord is m + k/m. 

But the maximum possible length of this chord is 26. So, m + k/m ≤ 26. 

But again, without knowing m, this is not helpful. 

This seems like a dead end. 

Let me go back to the initial assumption where we assumed angle between TV and VZ is 90°, leading to k = 1. Under this assumption, we found that k = 1. 

With k = 1, for any chord through V, the product of segments is 1. 

Now, if we consider that angle XVY is 90°, then for the two perpendicular chords VX and VY, each has product of segments equal to 1. 

So, for VX = a, VY = b, then a * (other segment) = 1, and b * (other segment) = 1. 

But how does this help? 

If we assume that the other segments are also 1, then a = 1 and b = 1, so XY = sqrt(1² + 1²) = √2. But this is not among the answer choices. 

Alternatively, if one of the segments is 1, and the other is 1, then the full length of the chord is 2. 

But how does this relate to the given data? 

Wait, but we know that ZV = 1, which is one of the chords. So, if ZV = 1, then the other segment is 1, making the full length of the chord 2. 

But this suggests that the distance from V to Z is 1, and from V to Z' is 1. 

But how does this help with finding XY? 

Maybe there's a relation between the chords ZX and VY. 

But I'm stuck. 

Wait, perhaps the answer is 12, which is choice C. Why? Because in the case where k = 1, and if we assume that the two perpendicular chords VX and VY have lengths such that their squares add up to 144, giving XY = 12. 

But why 144? 

Wait, if k = 1, then for any chord through V, the product of the segments is 1. So, if VX is a segment of length a, then the other segment is 1/a. 

If we assume that VX and VY are such that a * 1/a = 1 and b * 1/b = 1, then a and b can be any positive real numbers. 

But if we want to maximize or minimize XY, it would vary. 

But since the answer is one of the options, and given that ZV =
