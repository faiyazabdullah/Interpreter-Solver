====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing them out again to make sure I don't miss anything.

So, the given predicates are:

1. Triangle(X, W, Z) – So there's a triangle with vertices X, W, and Z.
2. Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(X, W, Z)), 23) – The measure of angle at point W in triangle XWZ is 23 degrees.
3. Equals(LengthOf(Line(C, B)), 4) – The length of segment CB is 4 units.
4. Equals(LengthOf(Line(A, C)), 4) – The length of segment AC is also 4 units.
5. RightAngle(Angle(X, W, B)) – The angle at point W between points X, W, B is a right angle.
6. RightAngle(Angle(Z, W, A)) – Similarly, the angle at point W between points Z, W, A is a right angle.
7. PointLiesOnLine(W, Line(X, Y)) – Point W lies on the line connecting X and Y.
8. PointLiesOnLine(W, Line(Z, Y)) – Point W also lies on the line connecting Z and Y.

The question asks for the measure of angle WYZ, which is denoted as ∠WYZ. The options are A. 4, B. 16, C. 23, D. 32.

Alright, let's break this down step by step.

Starting with STEP 1: Predicate Analysis and Setup.

First, identifying the geometric shapes. We have triangle XWZ from predicate 1. Then, there are points mentioned like A, B, C, Y, which aren't part of the initial triangle. Also, there are right angles involving points B and A. Points X, Y, Z are connected via lines with W lying on them.

Let me try to visualize this. Maybe drawing a rough sketch would help. Since I can't draw here, I'll imagine it.

We have triangle XWZ. At vertex W, there are two right angles mentioned: one between X, W, B and another between Z, W, A. Wait, but those are right angles. That suggests that lines WB and WA are perpendicular to some sides?

Wait, Angle(X, W, B) being a right angle means that at point W, the angle formed by points X, W, B is 90 degrees. Similarly, Angle(Z, W, A) is a right angle, so at point W, the angle formed by Z, W, A is 90 degrees. Therefore, lines WB and WA are perpendicular to WX and WZ respectively? Or maybe WB is perpendicular to WX, and WA is perpendicular to WZ?

Also, points W lies on lines XY and ZY. So, points X and Y are connected by a line that includes W, and similarly Z and Y are connected by a line that includes W. So, point Y is such that lines XY and ZY pass through W. Hence, Y is a point where lines XY and ZY meet at W? Wait, but if W is on both lines XY and ZY, then Y is a common point? Wait, no. If W is on line XY, then line XY passes through W. Similarly, line ZY passes through W. So Y is a point such that both lines XY and ZY go through W. But that would mean that Y is the same as W? No, because if Y were W, then line XY would be line XW, and line ZY would be line ZW. But the problem says that W lies on both lines XY and ZY. So Y could be another point such that lines XY and ZY pass through W. So perhaps Y is a different point, and W is somewhere along XY and ZY. So, Y is connected to both X and Z, passing through W. So, maybe Y is outside of triangle XWZ?

Also, we have segments CB and AC both of length 4. Not sure yet how they fit in.

Now, the main goal is to find the measure of angle WYZ. So, angle at point Y, between points W, Y, Z. So, looking at triangle WYZ? Or some other configuration.

Let me think about the structure. Since W is on both lines XY and ZY, then Y is connected to X and Z via lines passing through W. So, Y is connected to X and Z, and W is somewhere along those lines. So, perhaps Y is a point such that lines XY and ZY intersect at W. Therefore, Y is a point where lines XY and ZY meet at W. Wait, but if W is on both lines XY and ZY, then Y is not necessarily the intersection point unless W is Y. But that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a point such that line XY goes through W, and line ZY also goes through W. Therefore, Y is a point such that both lines XY and ZY pass through W. Which would imply that Y is on both lines XY and ZY? Wait, no. For example, line XY passes through W and Y. Similarly, line ZY passes through W and Y. So, that implies that Y is a point such that lines XY and ZY are two lines passing through W and Y. Therefore, Y is a point connected to X and Z via lines that pass through W. So, Y is connected to X and Z, and W is on those lines. Therefore, W is a point along XY and ZY, so Y is a point such that W is between X and Y, and also between Z and Y. Therefore, Y is outside the triangle XWZ, and W is between X-Y and Z-Y.

But then, how does that relate to the rest of the diagram? Also, there are points A and B involved. The lengths AC and CB are both 4. So, points A and B are connected to C, forming segments AC and CB of length 4. How do these points connect to the rest?

Looking back at the right angles. The right angles at W involve points X, W, B and Z, W, A. So, angle XWB is a right angle, meaning that line WB is perpendicular to line WX. Similarly, angle ZWA is a right angle, so line WA is perpendicular to line WZ.

Therefore, from point W, we have two lines: one going towards X and perpendicular to WB, and another towards Z and perpendicular to WA. Wait, maybe not. Let me clarify.

Angle(X, W, B) is a right angle. So, the angle at W between points X, W, B is 90 degrees. So, vectors WX and WB form a right angle. Similarly, angle(Z, W, A) is a right angle, so vectors WZ and WA form a right angle.

This suggests that WB is perpendicular to WX, and WA is perpendicular to WZ. Therefore, WB ⊥ WX and WA ⊥ WZ.

Given that, perhaps points A and B lie on certain lines. Also, since AC = 4 and BC = 4, perhaps there's a relationship between points A, B, and C?

Alternatively, maybe triangle ABC has some properties? But without more info, it's hard to tell.

Let me try to reconstruct the figure step by step.

First, triangle XWZ with angle at W being 23 degrees. Then, from point W, two perpendiculars: one to WX (which would be WB), and one to WZ (which would be WA). So, WA is perpendicular to WZ, and WB is perpendicular to WX.

Then, points A and B are located such that WA ⊥ WZ and WB ⊥ WX.

Additionally, point W lies on lines XY and ZY. So, Y is a point such that lines XY and ZY pass through W. Thus, Y is connected to X and Z, passing through W. So, lines XY and ZY both pass through W, implying that Y is a point where those lines meet. Wait, but if both lines pass through W, then Y must be the same as W? No, because Y is a distinct point. Wait, if line XY passes through W, then Y is a point such that W is on line XY. Similarly for ZY. So, Y is a point such that both lines XY and ZY pass through W. Therefore, Y is not W, but rather, W is a point on both lines XY and ZY. So, Y is a separate point, and lines XY and ZY are extended beyond W to meet at Y? Wait, but if Y is connected to X and Z, then lines XY and ZY would meet at Y. However, if W is on both lines, then W is a point along those lines. So, Y is a point such that line XY contains W and Y, and line ZY contains W and Y. Therefore, Y is a point such that both lines XY and ZY pass through W. This would mean that Y is the same as the intersection point of lines XY and ZY, but since W is already on both lines, that would imply that Y is W? No, that doesn't make sense. Unless Y is W, but then the lines XY and ZY would be lines starting at X and Z through W, which would mean that Y is W. But that seems conflicting with the existence of other points.

Hmm, perhaps there's confusion here. Let me re-express: 

Point W lies on line XY. So, line XY passes through W. Similarly, point W lies on line ZY, so line ZY also passes through W. Therefore, point Y is such that both lines XY and ZY pass through W. Therefore, Y is a point that is on both lines XY and ZY. But that would mean that Y is the intersection of lines XY and ZY. However, since W is on both lines, then Y must be W? Because if Y is the intersection of lines XY and ZY, then Y is the same as W? That would suggest that Y is W, but then the angle WYZ would be undefined because Y and W are the same point. That can't be right. Therefore, my understanding must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps the lines are named differently. Let me check the original predicates again:

PointLiesOnLine(W, Line(X, Y)) – so line XY passes through W. Similarly, PointLiesOnLine(W, Line(Z, Y)) – line ZY passes through W. So, line XY passes through W, and line ZY passes through W. Therefore, Y is a point such that line XY and line ZY both pass through W. Therefore, Y is not W, but lines XY and ZY are two different lines that both pass through W. Therefore, Y is a point that is connected to X and Z, but the lines XY and ZY pass through W. So, Y is a point such that line XY connects X to Y, passing through W; and line ZY connects Z to Y, passing through W. Therefore, Y is a point that is connected to X and Z via lines that go through W. So, W is between X and Y, and also between Z and Y. So, Y is a point such that W is on both lines XY and ZY, meaning that W is between X and Y, and between Z and Y. Therefore, Y is a point such that when you extend lines from X through W to Y, and from Z through W to Y, meeting at Y. So, Y is external to the triangle XWZ, and W is between X-Y and Z-Y.

Now, considering that, we can consider triangle WYZ. The angle we need is ∠WYZ, which is the angle at Y between points W, Y, Z.

To find this angle, perhaps we can use triangle properties, coordinate geometry, or trigonometry. Given that there are right angles and known lengths, maybe coordinate geometry would help.

Let me try assigning coordinates to points to model this scenario.

Let me place point W at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since there are right angles at W, maybe aligning axes accordingly would help.

From the right angles:

Angle(X, W, B) is a right angle, so WB is perpendicular to WX. Similarly, angle(Z, W, A) is a right angle, so WA is perpendicular to WZ.

Assume that WX and WZ are two lines emanating from W (origin). Let me define coordinates for X and Z first.

Let me assume that line WX is along the x-axis. Let me say point X is at (a, 0), and since angle at W between X, W, B is 90°, then WB is vertical. So, point B would be somewhere along the y-axis. Similarly, since angle at W between Z, W, A is a right angle, then WA is perpendicular to WZ. If WZ is another line from W, say making some angle θ with the x-axis, then WA would be perpendicular to WZ.

But maybe it's easier to assign coordinates step by step.

Let me set W at (0,0).

Since angle at W in triangle XWZ is 23°, which is angle XWZ. So, in triangle XWZ, angle at W is 23°, and we have two right angles at W involving other points.

Let me suppose that line WX is horizontal. Let me take point X at (x, 0), and point Z somewhere in the plane. Since angle XWZ is 23°, then the angle between lines WX and WZ is 23°. Also, from the right angles:

- Angle between WX and WB is 90°, so WB is vertical if WX is horizontal.
- Angle between WZ and WA is 90°, so WA is perpendicular to WZ.

Let me assign coordinates:

Set W at (0,0). Let’s take WX along positive x-axis. Let me choose coordinates for X as (c, 0) for some c > 0. Then, since angle XWZ is 23°, point Z should be placed such that the angle between WX (along x-axis) and WZ is 23°. So, if I take WZ making 23° above the x-axis. Wait, but the angle at W in triangle XWZ is angle XWZ, which is 23°, so the angle between XW and ZW is 23°. So, if XW is along the x-axis from W(0,0) to X(c, 0), then ZW would make an angle of 23° with XW. Therefore, direction from W to Z is 23° above the x-axis. So, coordinates of Z can be expressed as (d*cos(23°), d*sin(23°)) for some d > 0.

Now, from the right angles:

Angle(X, W, B) is 90°, so WB is perpendicular to WX. Since WX is along x-axis, WB is vertical. So, point B lies along the y-axis. Let's denote B as (0, b) for some b.

Similarly, angle(Z, W, A) is 90°, so WA is perpendicular to WZ. Since WZ is at 23° from x-axis, then the direction of WZ is 23°, so the direction perpendicular to WZ would be 23° + 90° = 113° from x-axis. Therefore, line WA is along 113° direction. So, point A lies along that line. Let me parametrize point A as (e*cos(113°), e*sin(113°)) for some e > 0.

Now, we also have LengthOf(Line(A, C)) = 4 and LengthOf(Line(C, B)) = 4. So, points A, C, B are connected such that AC = 4 and CB = 4. So, points A and B are connected through point C, with AC = CB = 4. Therefore, C is the midpoint of AB if AC = CB, but not necessarily colinear unless specified. Wait, but the problem states that the lengths are 4, so points A and B are connected via point C such that AC=CB=4. So, C lies somewhere such that it's 4 units away from both A and B. So, C is a point that forms two segments of length 4 from A and B. Therefore, C lies on the intersection of two circles: one centered at A with radius 4, and one centered at B with radius 4. The intersection points would give possible locations for C.

But without knowing the coordinates of A and B, it's difficult to proceed. However, since we have expressions for A and B in terms of parameters, maybe we can find relations.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to relate this to triangle WYZ.

Recall that Y is a point such that lines XY and ZY pass through W. So, Y is determined by extending lines from X through W to Y, and from Z through W to Y. Therefore, Y is a point such that:

- Line XY passes through W, so Y is on the extension of line WX beyond W. Wait, no. If line XY passes through W, then depending on the position of X and Y, W could be between X and Y or not. Similarly for line ZY.

But earlier assumption was that W is between X and Y and between Z and Y. So, Y is a point such that W is between X and Y, and between Z and Y. Therefore, Y is in the opposite direction from X and Z relative to W. So, if X is to the right of W along the x-axis, then Y is to the left of W along the same line. Similarly, if Z is at 23° from x-axis, then Y would be in the opposite direction of Z from W.

Wait, but if line ZY passes through W, then if Z is in the direction of 23°, then line ZY extends from Z through W to Y. So, Y is on the line ZW extended beyond W. Similarly, Y is on line XW extended beyond W.

Thus, Y is the intersection of the extensions of lines XW and ZW beyond W. Wait, but if both lines XW and ZW are extended beyond W, then their intersection would be at W itself. Wait, no. If you extend line XW beyond W, you get one ray, and extend line ZW beyond W, getting another ray. These rays are in different directions, so their intersection would be at W. Therefore, there is no other point Y unless... wait, unless Y is a different point where these lines intersect elsewhere. But that seems contradictory. There must be something wrong here.

Wait, maybe I misunderstood the lines. The lines are XY and ZY. So, line XY passes through W, which means that W is on line XY. So, line XY connects X and Y, passing through W. Similarly, line ZY connects Z and Y, passing through W. Therefore, Y is a point such that both lines XY and ZY pass through W. Therefore, Y is the intersection of lines XY and ZY. But since both lines pass through W, then Y must be W. But that would make angle WYZ undefined. Therefore, this suggests a contradiction, indicating that my previous assumptions are incorrect.

Perhaps the lines are not XY and ZY, but lines XY and ZY passing through W, meaning that W is a point on both lines. So, lines XY and ZY are two different lines that both contain W. Therefore, Y is not necessarily the intersection of those lines. Instead, each line XY and ZY contains W. So, Y is a point such that line XY contains W and Y, and line ZY contains W and Y. Therefore, Y is a single point such that both lines XY and ZY pass through W. This is only possible if Y is W. But again, that leads to the same issue.

Ah! Wait, maybe the lines are not XY and ZY but something else. Wait, the predicates are:

PointLiesOnLine(W, Line(X, Y)) → W lies on line XY.

PointLiesOnLine(W, Line(Z, Y)) → W lies on line ZY.

So, line XY passes through W, and line ZY passes through W. Therefore, both lines XY and ZY pass through W. Therefore, Y is a point such that line XY passes through W and line ZY passes through W. So, Y is a point that is not W, and both lines XY and ZY pass through W. Therefore, Y is a point such that W is on both lines XY and ZY. This implies that lines XY and ZY intersect at W. Therefore, Y is a point such that lines XY and ZY intersect at W. So, Y is the same as the intersection point of lines XY and ZY, which is W. But then Y=W, leading to the angle WYZ being undefined. Clearly, there's a misunderstanding here.

Maybe the lines are not XY and ZY, but other lines. Wait, the Line(X,Y) is the line connecting X and Y. If W lies on that line, then W is on line XY. Similarly, W lies on line ZY. So, Y is a point such that both lines XY and ZY pass through W. Therefore, Y must be the same point such that both lines XY and ZY pass through W. This can happen only if Y is W, which is impossible, or if lines XY and ZY are the same line, but that would require X and Z to be aligned with Y through W. But without more information, it's unclear.

This seems to be a critical issue. Perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the predicates. Let me read them again carefully:

PointLiesOnLine(W, Line(X, Y)) – This means that point W lies on the line defined by points X and Y. Similarly for the other predicate.

So, line XY contains W, and line ZY contains W. Therefore, both lines XY and ZY pass through W. Therefore, Y is a point such that line XY passes through W, and line ZY passes through W. So, Y is a point such that both lines XY and ZY pass through W. This implies that lines XY and ZY intersect at W, hence Y is a point that allows both lines to pass through W. This can happen if Y is such that line XY is one line containing W and Y, and line ZY is another line containing W and Y. Therefore, Y is a point such that both lines XY and ZY pass through W. This is only possible if Y is a point such that W is between X and Y, and also between Z and Y. Hence, Y is positioned such that extending lines from X through W to Y and from Z through W to Y. So, Y is a point that lies on both extensions of lines XW and ZW. Hence, Y is the intersection of the extensions of XW and ZW beyond W. Wait, but if XW and ZW are two different lines from W, then their extensions beyond W would diverge, so their intersection would be at W. So, unless Y is W itself, which brings us back to the earlier problem.

This suggests that there's either a mistake in the problem setup or a misinterpretation. Alternatively, perhaps Y is not a new point but the same as W? But that would make angle WYZ undefined. 

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Perhaps Y is a point such that both lines XY and ZY pass through W, implying that W is between X and Y and between Z and Y. So, Y is a point such that when you extend lines from X through W, you reach Y, and similarly from Z through W to Y. Therefore, Y is a point such that W is between X and Y and between Z and Y. Therefore, Y is located in the direction opposite to both X and Z from W. So, if W is between X and Y, then Y is in the opposite direction of X from W. Similarly, Y is in the opposite direction of Z from W. Therefore, Y is the intersection of the two lines extending from X and Z through W. So, if X and Z are on opposite sides of W, then Y would be the intersection of those extensions. But if X and Z are on the same side of W, then extending both would not meet at a single Y. 

But given that in triangle XWZ, angle at W is 23°, so points X and Z are on opposite sides of W. Therefore, extending XW and ZW beyond W would lead to lines that diverge, so their intersection would be at infinity. Hmm, not helpful.

This seems too vague. Maybe I should focus on the parts that are solvable regardless of Y's position.

The question is about angle WYZ. Let's consider triangle WYZ. To find its angle at Y, we might need to know more about the triangle. Perhaps using the fact that there are right angles at W involving other points, and the lengths AC and CB.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to relate the given lengths and angles to find the desired angle.

Another idea: Since there are right angles at W involving points A and B, and segments AC and CB of length 4, perhaps points A and B are related to C in such a way that triangle ACB is isoceles or something. But without knowing the relation between A, B, and C, it's hard to say.

Wait, the given lengths are LengthOf(Line(C,B)) = 4 and LengthOf(Line(A,C)) = 4. So, AC = CB = 4. So, C is a point such that it is 4 units away from both A and B. So, C lies on the perpendicular bisector of segment AB. But unless we know more about A and B, we can't proceed further.

However, we also have that WA is perpendicular to WZ and WB is perpendicular to WX. So, if we can express coordinates for A and B, maybe we can find C and relate it to Y.

Let me try to assign coordinates again, assuming W is at (0,0), X is at (a, 0), Z is at (b*cosθ, b*sinθ), where θ is the angle between WZ and x-axis, which is 23°, since angle XWZ is 23°.

So, angle between WX (along x-axis) and WZ is 23°, so θ = 23°. So, Z is at (b*cos(23°), b*sin(23°)).

Now, WB is perpendicular to WX (which is along x-axis), so WB is vertical. So, point B is at (0, k) for some k.

Similarly, WA is perpendicular to WZ. The slope of WZ is tan(23°), so the slope of WA, being perpendicular, is -cot(23°). Therefore, line WA has equation y = -cot(23°)x. So, point A lies somewhere on this line. Let's parameterize point A as (m, -m*cot(23°)) for some m.

Now, we have AC = 4 and CB = 4. So, points A and B are fixed in their positions, and C is a point such that distance from A to C is 4 and from B to C is 4. So, C is the intersection of two circles: one centered at A with radius 4, and one centered at B with radius 4. Solving these equations would give possible positions for C.

Once we have C, perhaps we can find relations to Y. But how does Y come into play?

Recall that Y is a point such that lines XY and ZY pass through W. As discussed earlier, this likely places Y in a specific location relative to X, Z, and W. Once we have coordinates for Y, we can compute angle WYZ.

But without knowing the exact positions of A and B, it's challenging. However, maybe we can find relations using the given lengths and angles.

Alternatively, maybe there's a property or theorem that relates these elements without needing full coordinate calculation.

Wait, let's recall that in triangle XWZ, angle at W is 23°, and at W, there are two right angles involving points A and B. Maybe these right angles form rectangles or squares with respect to other points?

For instance, since WB is perpendicular to WX, and WA is perpendicular to WZ, then points A and B form a rectangle with W and some other point? Not sure.

Alternatively, since WA ⊥ WZ and WB ⊥ WX, then lines WA and WB are perpendicular to WZ and WX respectively. So, if we consider the quadrilateral formed by W, A, B, and some other point?

Alternatively, since AC = CB = 4, maybe C is the center of a square or something, but not sure.

Alternatively, since AC = CB = 4, and WA and WB are perpendicular to WZ and WX, maybe triangle ABC is related to some other triangle.

But I'm stuck here. Let me try to think of another approach.

Let me consider triangle WYZ. We need to find angle at Y, ∠WYZ. To find this angle, we might need to know more about triangle WYZ. If we can find the lengths of sides around Y or other angles, we could apply the Law of Sines or Cosines.

But how to find those lengths? Let's see.

Since Y is on both lines XY and ZY, passing through W, then lines XY and ZY extend from X and Z through W to Y. So, if I can find the ratios of segments, maybe using similar triangles or something.

But without knowing the lengths of WX, WZ, or other segments, it's hard to proceed. However, maybe we can relate it to the right angles and the lengths AC and CB.

Wait, perhaps the key lies in recognizing that angle WYZ is complementary or supplementary to some known angle.

Alternatively, since there are two right angles at W, and angle XWZ is 23°, maybe angle WYZ is related to 23° through some geometric relationship.

Wait, let's imagine that lines XY and ZY extend through W to Y. Then, triangle WYZ has sides WY, ZY, and WZ. Wait, no—WY is part of line XY, and ZY is part of line ZY. So, WY is a segment from W to Y, and ZY is from Z to Y. Wait, but Y is such that line ZY passes through W, so ZY is from Z to Y, passing through W. So, W is between Z and Y. Similarly, W is between X and Y. So, WY is the segment from W to Y, which is extended from XW and ZW.

In this case, triangle WYZ has sides WZ, WY, and ZY. Wait, but ZY is from Z to Y, which passes through W. So, ZY is split into two parts: from Z to W and from W to Y. So, ZY = ZW + WY.

Similarly, WY is from W to Y, and WX is from W to X, with X to Y passing through W.

But how does this help?

Maybe using the fact that in triangle XWZ, angle at W is 23°, and with the right angles at W, we can derive some relations.

Let me think about the entire figure. From point W, there are two perpendiculars: WB ⊥ WX and WA ⊥ WZ. So, if we consider the quadrilateral formed by W, A, B, and some other point, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since AC = CB = 4, maybe C is the midpoint of AB, and since WA and WB are perpendicular to WZ and WX, perhaps C lies on some significant line.

Alternatively, let's try to use vector methods. Assume W is at origin, and assign vectors to points.

Let me define vectors:

Let me take W as origin (0,0).

Vector WX is some vector, say, vector u.

Vector WZ is another vector, say, vector v.

Given that angle between u and v is 23°, since angle XWZ is 23°.

Now, since WB is perpendicular to WX, vector WB is perpendicular to vector u. Let's call vector WB as w, which is perpendicular to u.

Similarly, vector WA is perpendicular to vector v, so vector WA is perpendicular to v. Let's call it vector a.

Now, points A and B are located at vector WA and vector WB, respectively. So, point A is at vector a, and point B is at vector w.

Now, AC = 4 and CB = 4. So, the distance from A to C is 4, and from B to C is 4. So, point C is such that it is equidistant from A and B, so it lies on the perpendicular bisector of AB. Let's find coordinates of C.

Let me assume vector a and vector w are known, then C is somewhere on the perpendicular bisector. But without knowing the exact vectors, it's still abstract.

But perhaps there's a relationship between vectors a and w. Since WA is perpendicular to WZ (vector v), and WB is perpendicular to WX (vector u). So, vector a · v = 0, and vector w · u = 0.

But I'm not sure how this helps with finding C.

Alternatively, since AC = CB = 4, maybe triangle ABC is isoceles with AC = CB, so C lies on the perpendicular bisector of AB. If I can find the coordinates of A and B, then I can find C.

But without knowing the exact vectors, this is still abstract. Maybe I need to relate this to the rest of the diagram.

Wait, the angle we're trying to find is ∠WYZ. Let's think about triangle WYZ. To find this angle, we might need to know the slopes of WY and ZY, or use some other method.

Since Y is on both lines XY and ZY, passing through W. Let me assume that Y is such that W divides XY and ZY in some ratio. If I can find the ratio, I might be able to use similar triangles.

But without knowing the lengths of WX or WZ, this is challenging. However, maybe there's a way to relate it through the right angles.

Let me consider that from point W, we have two perpendiculars: WB and WA. If I can find the lengths of WB and WA, maybe I can relate them to the lengths AC and CB.

Wait, but we don't know the lengths of WA or WB. However, we do know that AC = CB = 4. Maybe there's a relationship between WA, WB, and AC, CB?

Alternatively, since AC = CB = 4, and if C is the midpoint of AB, then AB = 8. But unless we know more about A and B, this is not directly helpful.

Wait, let me think of special cases. Suppose that AC and CB are both 4, and C is the midpoint of AB. Then, AB = 8. Now, if points A and B are located such that WA is perpendicular to WZ and WB is perpendicular to WX, then maybe there's a relationship between AB and the angles at W.

But I'm still stuck.

Let me try to switch gears. Since the answer choices are small numbers, maybe the angle is 23°, or related to it. Given that the given angle at W is 23°, and there are right angles, maybe angle WYZ is 23°, making answer C. But why?

Alternatively, since there are two right angles at W, maybe triangle WYZ is related to those right angles, leading to some complementary or supplementary angles.

Wait, if I consider that lines XY and ZY pass through W, then angle WYZ is formed by lines YW and YZ. Since YW is part of line XY, and YZ is part of line ZY. So, angle WYZ is the angle between line YW (which is the extension of WX through W to Y) and line YZ (which is the extension of WZ through W to Y). So, this angle is the supplement of the angle between lines WX and WZ, which is 23°. Wait, let me explain.

At point W, the angle between WX and WZ is 23°. When we extend these lines through W to Y, the angle between YW and YZ would be the same as the angle between WX and WZ, but on the other side. Wait, no. If you extend WX through W to Y, then line YW is in the opposite direction of WX. Similarly, extending WZ through W to Y gives line YZ in the opposite direction of WZ. So, the angle between YW and YZ would be the supplementary angle to the original angle at W.

Wait, let me visualize: originally, at W, the angle between WX and WZ is 23°. When you extend WX through W to Y, the line YW is opposite to WX. Similarly, extending WZ through W to Y, line YZ is opposite to WZ. So, the angle between YW and YZ would be 180° - 23° = 157°, but that doesn't match any of the options. Alternatively, maybe it's the angle between YW and YZ, which could be the same as the original angle, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when you extend WX through W to Y, and WZ through W to Y, then the angle between YW and YZ is equal to the angle between WX and WZ, but on the other side. So, it's still 23°? No, because extending the lines would create an exterior angle.

Actually, when you extend the lines, the angle at Y between YW and YZ would depend on the orientation. Let me think of it as follows: at point W, the original angle between WX and WZ is 23°. When you extend WX to Y, and WZ to Y, then the angle at Y between YW and YZ would be the same as the original angle at W, because of the straight lines. Wait, no. It depends on how the lines are extended.

Alternatively, since lines XY and ZY pass through W, and Y is on both, then the angle at Y between WY and ZY is equal to the angle between the extensions of WX and WZ. But since the original angle at W was 23°, the angle at Y would be 180° - 23° = 157°, which isn't among the options. So, this suggests that my assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship with the right angles at W. Since there are two right angles at W, perhaps forming some right triangles that relate to Y.

Wait, let me consider that from W, there are two right angles: one between WX and WB, and another between WZ and WA. If I can form a rectangle or something with these right angles.

Suppose we construct a rectangle with W, A, B, and another point. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard.

Alternatively, since AC = CB = 4, and if C is related to A and B, which are related to the right angles at W, perhaps there's a way to use Pythagoras.

Let me try to assume specific lengths for simplicity. Let me assume that WX and WZ are of certain lengths, then calculate other lengths.

Let me assume that WX = a, WZ = b. Then, since angle at W is 23°, the length of XZ can be found using the Law of Cosines: XZ² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(23°). But not sure if this helps.

But since there are right angles at W involving points A and B, perhaps WA and WB are heights or something. But again, not sure.

Wait, since WA is perpendicular to WZ, and WB is perpendicular to WX, then WA and WB are altitudes from W to lines WZ and WX, respectively. Wait, but WA is not necessarily an altitude of a triangle, unless there's a triangle involved.

Alternatively, if I consider triangle WAB, with WA ⊥ WZ and WB ⊥ WX, but I don't see the connection.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for patterns in the answer choices. The given angle is 23°, and the options are 4, 16, 23, 32. Since 23 is one of the options (C), and it's the given angle, maybe the answer is 23. But why?

Alternatively, maybe angle WYZ is half of 23°, but 11.5 is not an option. Or 90 - 23 = 67, not an option. Or 23 + 4 = 27, not an option. Or 23 divided by something.

Alternatively, since there are two right angles at W, maybe angle WYZ is 45°, but not in options. Or 90 - 23 = 67, no. Or 180 - 2*23 = 134, no.

Wait, another thought: if lines XY and ZY pass through W, and Y is such that W is between X and Y and between Z and Y, then triangle WYZ has angles at W, Y, and Z. Wait, but we need angle at Y.

If we can find the other angles in triangle WYZ, we can find angle at Y.

Let me assume that in triangle WYZ, we know some angles. For example, at W, the angle between WY and WZ. Wait, but W is not part of triangle WYZ. Wait, triangle WYZ has vertices W, Y, Z. So, at W, the angle is between WY and WZ. But WY is the line from W to Y, and WZ is the line from W to Z. So, the angle at W in triangle WYZ is the same as the angle between WY and WZ, which is the same as the original angle at W in triangle XWZ, which is 23°? No, because WY is in the opposite direction of WX, and WZ is as before. Wait, no. If WY is the extension of WX through W to Y, then the angle between WY and WZ would be 180° - original angle at W. Wait, let me think again.

Original angle at W in triangle XWZ is between WX and WZ, which is 23°. If we extend WX through W to Y, then WY is in the opposite direction of WX. So, the angle between WY and WZ would be 180° - 23° = 157°, but that's the angle at W in triangle WYZ. Then, in triangle WYZ, we have angle at W is 157°, and we need to find angle at Y. But without knowing other angles or sides, it's hard to proceed.

But maybe there's another angle in triangle WYZ. Let me consider the sum of angles in a triangle: 180°. So, if angle at W is 157°, then the sum of angles at Y and Z is 23°. But without more info, this is not helpful.

Alternatively, if there's a right angle at Y, but there's no indication of that.

Wait, but there are right angles at W involving points A and B. Maybe those right angles relate to triangle WYZ.

Alternatively, since AC = CB = 4, and points A and B are related to the right angles at W, maybe triangle ABC is a right triangle or something, allowing us to find relations.

Let me try to consider that AC = CB = 4. So, triangle ABC is isoceles with AC = CB. So, the base angles at A and B are equal. But without knowing the type of triangle, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, since WA is perpendicular to WZ and WB is perpendicular to WX, and AC = CB = 4, maybe there's a way to relate WA and WB to AC and CB.

But I'm running out of ideas. Given that I'm stuck, and the answer options include 23°, which is the given angle, maybe the answer is 23°, option C. But I need to justify it.

Wait, another possibility: since angle at W in triangle XWZ is 23°, and there are right angles at W, maybe angle WYZ is equal to 23° due to some reflection or symmetry. But why?

Alternatively, if lines XY and ZY are such that angle WYZ is equal to the original angle at W, which is 23°. But I need to justify this.

Alternatively, consider that lines XY and ZY pass through W, and since the original angle at W is 23°, the angle at Y is somehow preserved. But this is too vague.

Given that I cannot find a clear path forward, and considering that the given angle is 23°, and the answer choices include it, I'll tentatively choose option C, 23°, as the answer.
