MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let's start by listing out all the points and the relationships mentioned.

So, we have several points: J, L, C, H, K, E, B. There's also a circle named J. Wait, the first line says Circle(J). So point J is the center of the circle? Or maybe there's confusion here because J is also a point. Wait, maybe the circle is named Circle(J), so perhaps J is the center. Then PointLiesOnCircle(L, Circle(J)) means point L is on the circle centered at J. Also, PointLiesOnLine(J, Line(H, B)) – so point J lies on the line connecting H and B. Hmm, that's interesting. So J is a point on the line HB. Also, PointLiesOnLine(K, Line(E, J)) means K is on the line connecting E and J. 

Then, Angle(K,J,H) – so angle at point J between points K and H. Then MeasureOf(Angle(H,J,B)) equals 116 degrees. And Tangent(Line(H, B), Circle(J)) – so the line HB is tangent to the circle centered at J. Wait, but if J is the center of the circle, then a tangent line to the circle would touch it at exactly one point. However, since J is on line HB, does that mean that line HB passes through the center J? But if HB is tangent to the circle, then the tangent line touches the circle at exactly one point. But if J is the center, then the line HB passes through J, which would make it a radius. But a tangent line can't pass through the center unless it's... wait, no. Wait, if a line is tangent to a circle, then the distance from the center to the line must be equal to the radius. But if the line passes through the center, then the distance from the center to the line is zero, which would mean the line intersects the circle at two points (since the line passes through the center), which contradicts being a tangent. Therefore, there's something wrong here. Wait, maybe my initial assumption is incorrect. Maybe J isn't the center of the circle. Wait, the first predicate is Circle(J), which usually denotes a circle with center J. But then the next predicate says PointLiesOnCircle(L, Circle(J)), so L is on the circle with center J. Then, Tangent(Line(H, B), Circle(J)). So line HB is tangent to the circle centered at J. But if J is the center, then line HB must be tangent to the circle, which implies that line HB is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency. But since J is on line HB, then the line HB passes through the center J. That would imply that the line HB passes through the center and is tangent, which is impossible unless the line is tangent at J itself. But J is the center, so the radius would be zero length? No, that doesn't make sense. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here.

Wait, maybe there's a typo in the problem. Perhaps the circle is named differently. Let me check again. The given predicates are:

Circle(J)

Point(L)

Point(C)

Point(H)

Point(J)

Point(K)

Point(E)

Point(B)

PointLiesOnCircle(L, Circle(J))

PointLiesOnLine(J, Line(H, B))

PointLiesOnLine(K, Line(E, J))

Angle(K,J,H)

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(H,J,B)), 116)

Tangent(Line(H, B), Circle(J))

Ah! Here, Circle(J) is a circle, and J is a point. So J is both a point and the name of the circle? That seems confusing. Wait, perhaps the circle is named after point J, so J is the center. But then the line HB is tangent to the circle, which requires that the line HB is tangent at some point. However, if J is the center, then line HB passes through J, so the line HB would intersect the circle at J? Wait, no. Because if J is the center, then the line HB passes through J, so the line HB would go through the center. For a line passing through the center, it's a secant line, not a tangent. Therefore, this suggests that there's an inconsistency unless the line HB is tangent at a different point. Wait, but the line HB passes through J, the center. Therefore, the distance from J to line HB is zero, which would mean that the line HB intersects the circle at two points (since it passes through the center), hence cannot be tangent. This contradiction suggests that perhaps my interpretation is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the circle is not centered at J. Wait, the first predicate is Circle(J), which typically names the circle by its center. But maybe in this problem, J is just a label for the circle, not necessarily the center. Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Let me think again.

Let me re-express the given data more carefully:

We have a circle called J. Points: L, C, H, K, E, B. Also, J is a point. So J is both a point and the name of the circle. So the circle J has center somewhere else? Or is J the center?

But the PointLiesOnCircle(L, Circle(J)) means that point L is on the circle J. So circle J is defined, and point L lies on it. Then, PointLiesOnLine(J, Line(H, B)): so point J lies on the line HB. So line HB contains point J. Then, PointLiesOnLine(K, Line(E, J)): so point K is on line EJ. 

Also, Angle(K,J,H): the angle at point J between points K and H. So ∠KJH. 

MeasureOf(Angle(H,J,B)) = 116°, so ∠HJB is 116°. 

And Tangent(Line(H, B), Circle(J)): the line HB is tangent to circle J. 

Now, putting this together: line HB is tangent to circle J, which contains point L. Since line HB is tangent to the circle, it touches the circle at exactly one point. But point J is on line HB. So if the line HB is tangent to circle J, then point J must be the point of tangency. Wait, but if J is on the circle, then the line HB passes through J and is tangent to the circle. That would mean that J is the point where the line HB is tangent to the circle. Therefore, line HB is tangent at point J. But if J is on the circle, then the tangent line at J would be perpendicular to the radius at J. The radius at J would be the line from the center of the circle to J. But if J is on the circle, then the radius is from the center to J. However, the line HB is tangent at J, so the line HB is perpendicular to the radius at J. Therefore, the radius at J (from the center of the circle to J) is perpendicular to HB. 

But we also know that point J lies on line HB. So the line HB passes through J and is tangent to the circle at J. Therefore, the radius at J (from the center of the circle to J) is perpendicular to HB. Thus, the center of the circle J must lie along the line perpendicular to HB at point J. 

Wait, but the circle is named J, so perhaps the circle's center is not J. Wait, earlier I thought that Circle(J) implies the circle is centered at J, but that leads to contradictions. So maybe the circle J is named after point J, but the actual center is a different point? Or maybe the circle is not named after the center. Wait, this is unclear. Let me try to clarify.

Assuming that Circle(J) refers to a circle whose center is some other point, say O, but the circle is labeled as J. But that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps there was a mistake in the problem statement, and the circle is actually centered at point L, or another point. But without more info, I need to proceed with the given data.

Let me try to draw a rough sketch mentally. We have line HB, which contains point J. Line HB is tangent to circle J (the circle). Therefore, the point of tangency must be J itself, because J is on line HB. Hence, the tangent line at J. Therefore, the radius at the point of tangency J must be perpendicular to HB. So the radius from the center of the circle to J is perpendicular to HB. Therefore, the center of the circle lies along the line perpendicular to HB at point J. 

Now, the circle J includes point L, which lies on the circle. So point L is on the circle, and the center of the circle is somewhere along the line perpendicular to HB at J. 

Additionally, we have point K lying on line EJ. So line EJ connects points E and J, and K is somewhere on that line. Also, there's an angle ∠KJH, which is the angle at J between points K and H. 

Given that ∠HJB measures 116°, which is the angle at J between points H and B. Since line HB is tangent to the circle at J, and the radius to the point of tangency is perpendicular to HB. So the radius at J is perpendicular to HB. Therefore, the center of the circle lies along the line perpendicular to HB at J. 

But we don't know where the center is. However, point L is on the circle, so the center lies along the perpendicular line at J, and the distance from the center to J is the radius. Also, point L is on the circle, so the distance from the center to L is equal to the radius. Therefore, the center lies on the perpendicular to HB at J, and OL = OJ, where O is the center. 

But maybe we don't need to find the center. Let's focus on the angles. 

We are asked to find the measure of arc JK L, which I assume is the arc from J to K passing through L? Or maybe it's the arc JKL? Wait, the notation m∠JKL could be ambiguous, but since it's written as m widehat JKL, likely it's referring to the measure of the arc JLK? Wait, the standard notation for an arc is usually three letters, where the middle letter is the vertex. But sometimes, it can be ambiguous. However, given the options, it's probably the measure of arc JKL, which would be the arc from J to L passing through K. Wait, but without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to tell. But let me think again.

The question asks for m∠JKL, but the user wrote m \widehat JKL, which is the measure of the arc JKL. Wait, no—usually, the arc symbol over three points indicates the arc from the first to the third point passing through the second. So arc JKL would be the arc starting at J, going through K, ending at L. However, depending on the diagram, this could vary. Alternatively, maybe it's the arc from J to L passing through K. 

But regardless, we need to find the measure of that arc. Given that, we need to use circle theorems. 

First, note that line HB is tangent to the circle at J. Therefore, the tangent at J is line HB. From the property of tangents, the angle between the tangent and the chord through the point of contact is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. 

In this case, the tangent is HB, and the chord through J would be any chord passing through J. However, since J is the point of tangency, and we have points K and L on the circle, maybe we can consider certain angles. 

Alternatively, since we know angle HJB is 116°, which is the angle between HB and JB. Wait, but point J is on line HB, so JB is part of the same line. Wait, no. Wait, point J is on line HB. So line HB goes through J. So points H, J, B are colinear with J between H and B? Or maybe not necessarily. Wait, the line HB is tangent at J, so J is the point where the tangent meets the line. So J is on line HB, and HB is tangent at J. Therefore, points H and B are such that the line HB is tangent to the circle at J. So J is the point of tangency. Therefore, H and B are points on the tangent line HB, with J being the point where it touches the circle. 

Therefore, the line HB is tangent at J, so the radius at J is perpendicular to HB. Let's denote the center of the circle as O. Then, OJ is perpendicular to HB. 

Now, considering point K on line EJ. Also, angle KJH is given. Wait, angle at J between K and H. So angle KJH is formed by lines JK and JH. 

Since angle HJB is 116°, which is the angle at J between H and B. Since points H, J, B are colinear, then angle HJB is a straight angle if B is on the extension of HJ beyond J. Wait, but that would make angle HJB 180°, but the given measure is 116°, which is less than 180. Therefore, points H, J, B are arranged such that J is between H and B, making angle HJB the angle between HJ and BJ. Wait, but if J is between H and B, then angle HJB is a straight angle, which contradicts the given 116°. Therefore, this suggests that my previous conclusion about the arrangement is incorrect. 

Wait, let me think again. If line HB is tangent to the circle at J, then J is the point of tangency. Therefore, the line HB is tangent at J, so J is a single point on the line HB where it touches the circle. Therefore, points H and B are on either side of J on the tangent line. So the line HB extends infinitely in both directions, with J being the point where it touches the circle. Therefore, angle HJB is formed by points H, J, B. Since J is the point of tangency, and H and B are points on the tangent line, the angle at J between H and B would be zero because they're colinear. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Unless H and B are not on the line HB? No, that's contradictory. 

This suggests there's a fundamental error in my understanding. Let me re-examine the problem. 

The given predicates include:

PointLiesOnLine(J, Line(H, B)) → J is on line HB.

Tangent(Line(H, B), Circle(J)) → line HB is tangent to circle J.

So line HB is tangent to circle J, and J is a point on line HB. Therefore, the line HB is tangent to the circle at point J. That implies that point J is the point of tangency. Therefore, the radius at point J must be perpendicular to line HB. 

Thus, the radius from the center of circle J to point J is perpendicular to line HB. Therefore, the center of the circle lies along the line perpendicular to HB at J. 

Now, point L is on the circle, so it's on the circumference. So the center is somewhere along the perpendicular to HB at J, and L is a point on the circle. 

Now, angle HJB is given as 116°. Since J is on line HB, and H and B are points on the line HB, the angle at J between H and B should be zero if they are collinear. But the measure is given as 116°, which suggests that H and B are not on the same line as J. Wait, but the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(J, Line(H, B)), which means J is on line HB. So H, J, B are colinear with J between H and B. Then, angle HJB is the angle between segments JH and JB, which are parts of the same line, making the angle 180°, but it's given as 116°. Contradiction again. 

This suggests that there's an error in interpreting the predicates. Let me check again. 

Wait, perhaps the angle HJB is not the angle between HJ and BJ, but rather the angle at J between points H, J, B. But if H, J, B are colinear, then the angle is 180°, which conflicts with the given 116°. Therefore, this implies that the points H, J, B are not colinear, but the predicate says J lies on line HB. Which would require them to be colinear. 

This is very confusing. There must be a misinterpretation of the predicates. Let me recheck the original problem's predicates.

Original predicates:

PointLiesOnLine(J, Line(H, B)) → J lies on the line through H and B.

Tangent(Line(H, B), Circle(J)) → line HB is tangent to circle J.

So line HB is tangent to circle J, and J is a point on line HB. Therefore, the line HB is tangent to circle J at point J. This is only possible if the line HB touches the circle at J, implying that J is the point of tangency. Therefore, the line HB is tangent at J, so the radius at J is perpendicular to HB. 

However, if J is on the line HB, then the radius at J (which is from the center of the circle to J) is perpendicular to HB. 

Now, considering angle HJB is 116°. Since H, J, B are on line HB, angle HJB is a straight angle, which is 180°, conflicting with the given 116°. This contradiction suggests that the angle is not formed by H, J, B being colinear. 

Wait, but the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(J, Line(H, B)), which means J is on the line HB, so H, J, B are colinear. Therefore, angle HJB must be 180°, but it's given as 116°, which is impossible. 

This indicates that there's a mistake in the problem setup, or perhaps a misread of the predicates. Let me double-check the original problem again.

Wait, looking back: the predicate is Angle(K,J,H), which is angle at J between K and H. And Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(H,J,B)), 116). So the angle at J between H and B is 116°. But if H, J, B are colinear, this is impossible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem, or perhaps the line HB is not the same as the line containing H and B? No, that's what the predicate says. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is not between H and B, but between H and B in some other way. Wait, the measure of angle HJB is 116°, which is angle at J between H and B. So if H, J, B are not colinear, then that angle exists. But the predicate says J is on line HB, making them colinear. This is a contradiction. 

Perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the predicate PointLiesOnLine(J, Line(H, B)). Could it mean that J is on the line HB, but not necessarily between H and B? Like, J could be extended beyond H or B. For example, if H and B are points, and J is on the line HB, but not between them. In that case, H---B---J or H---J---B. But even then, angle HJB would still involve points H, J, B, but if J is not between H and B, the angle would be formed. 

For instance, suppose line HB is extended beyond B to a point J. Then, angle at J between H and B would be the angle between lines JH and JB. Wait, but if J is on the line HB extended beyond B, then JH is the line from J to H, and JB is from J to B. These two lines form an angle at J. 

Similarly, if J is on the extension of HB beyond H, then angle at J between H and B would be the angle between JH and JB. 

So in either case, the points H, J, B are colinear with J outside the segment HB. In this scenario, angle HJB is the angle between lines JH and JB, which are opposite rays, forming a straight angle. Wait, no. If J is on the extension of HB beyond B, then lines JH and JB are in the same direction, forming a straight angle. But if J is on the extension beyond H, then lines JH and JB would form an angle of 180° as well. 

Wait, this still suggests that angle HJB is 180°, contradicting the given 116°. 

This indicates that there is a fundamental flaw in the problem setup, possibly due to a misstatement of the predicates. However, assuming that the problem is correctly formulated, perhaps there's a different interpretation. 

Wait, perhaps the line HB is not the same as the line through H and B. Wait, no, the predicate says Line(H, B), which is the line through H and B. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle HJB is not the angle between HJ and BJ, but between HJ and BJ as vectors. Wait, no, angle at J between H and B is always the angle between JH and JB. 

At this point, I'm stuck because the given conditions seem contradictory. However, since this is a problem presented for solving, I'll proceed under the assumption that there's a misinterpretation, and try to adjust accordingly. 

Let me assume that the angle HJB is 116°, and that points H, J, B are not colinear. Even though the predicate says J lies on line HB, which would make them colinear. Perhaps there's a mistake in the problem, and instead of J being on line HB, it's another condition. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is not between H and B, but between H and some other point. Wait, the given is Angle(K,J,H), which is angle at J between K and H. And Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(H,J,B)), 116). So the angle at J between H and B is 116°, which would require H, J, B to form a non-straight angle. Therefore, the predicate PointLiesOnLine(J, Line(H, B)) must be misinterpreted. 

Wait, perhaps the predicate is PointLiesOnLine(J, Line(H, B)) means that J is on the line defined by H and B. But if that's the case, then H, J, B are colinear, leading to the angle being 180°. But the given measure is 116°, so this is impossible. 

Unless the angle is not between H and B, but between H and B in some other way. Wait, maybe the angle is between HJ and BJ, but if J is not between H and B, then angle HJB is formed. For example, if J is on the line HB extended beyond B, then angle HJB would be the angle between JH and JB, which is the same as the angle between HB and JB, but measured at J. 

Wait, let's imagine that line HB is extended beyond B to a point J. So the order is H --- B --- J. Then, angle HJB is the angle at J between H and B. But in this case, J is on the line HB extended beyond B. So from point J, the lines JH and JB are in opposite directions. So the angle between JH and JB is 180°, which again contradicts the given 116°. 

Alternatively, if J is on the line HB extended beyond H, then the angle at J between H and B would still be 180°. 

This suggests that the only way for angle HJB to be 116° is if points H, J, B are not colinear, which contradicts the predicate stating that J is on line HB. 

Given this contradiction, I must conclude that there's an error in the problem's predicates. However, since this is a hypothetical exercise, I'll proceed by assuming that the angle HJB is indeed 116°, and that the points are arranged such that J is not on the line HB, despite the predicate saying otherwise. Perhaps the predicate is miswritten, and it should be PointLiesOnLine(L, Line(H, B))? Or another point? 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is not between H and B, but between other points. Let me re-read the given predicates. 

The given predicates are:

- PointLiesOnLine(J, Line(H, B)) → J is on line HB.

- Angle(K,J,H) → angle at J between K and H.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(H,J,B)), 116) → angle at J between H and B is 116°.

So these suggest that J is on line HB, making H, J, B colinear, but the angle at J between H and B is 116°, which is impossible. 

This contradiction suggests that the problem may have a typo, and the intended predicate was PointLiesOnLine(K, Line(H, B)) instead of J. Or perhaps the angle is not at J, but elsewhere. 

Assuming that the angle HJB is 116°, and ignoring the contradiction, let's proceed. Let's assume that points H, J, B form a triangle with angle at J of 116°, and line HB is tangent to the circle at J. 

Wait, if line HB is tangent to the circle at J, then the radius at J is perpendicular to HB. So, if we consider the center of the circle, say O, then OJ is perpendicular to HB. 

Now, the angle at J between H and B is 116°, which would be the angle between JH and JB. But since HB is tangent at J, and OJ is perpendicular to HB, then the angle between OJ and HB is 90°. 

Now, if we consider triangle HJB, with angle at J of 116°, and the line HB is tangent to the circle at J. 

Now, we need to find the measure of arc JKL. Assuming that K is on line EJ, and L is on the circle. 

Since the problem involves a circle, and we're dealing with arcs, it's likely that we need to use properties of tangents and angles subtended by arcs. 

Let me recall that the angle between a tangent and a chord is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. 

In this case, the tangent is HB at point J, and the chord is JL (assuming L is a point on the circle). The angle between tangent HB and chord JL is equal to the angle subtended by JL in the alternate segment. 

But we don't know where L is. However, we do know that point L is on the circle. 

Alternatively, since we have angle HJB = 116°, which is the angle between HB (tangent) and JB. According to the Alternate Segment Theorem, this angle is equal to the angle subtended by the chord JB in the alternate segment. 

Wait, but JB is a line from J to B, and since J is the point of tangency, JB is a line from the point of tangency to a point on the tangent line. But the Alternate Segment Theorem states that the angle between the tangent and the chord is equal to the angle subtended by the chord in the alternate segment. 

In this case, the tangent is HB at J, and the chord is J to some other point on the circle. Let's say the chord is JL. Then, the angle between tangent HB and chord JL is equal to the angle subtended by JL in the alternate segment. 

But without knowing where L is, it's difficult to apply directly. 

Alternatively, since we're trying to find the measure of arc JKL, perhaps involving points J, K, L on the circle. 

Given that K is on line EJ, and angle KJH is given. 

Let me try to summarize what we know:

1. Line HB is tangent to circle at J.
2. Point J is on line HB.
3. Angle at J between H and B is 116°, which must mean that H, J, B are not colinear, despite the predicate. 
4. Point L is on the circle.
5. Point K is on line EJ.
6. Angle KJH is formed at J between K and H.
7. Need to find measure of arc JKL.

Assuming that the angle HJB is 116°, and line HB is tangent at J, then applying the Alternate Segment Theorem, the angle between tangent HB and chord JB is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. 

Wait, if the tangent is at J, and the chord is JB, then the angle between HB and JB is equal to the angle subtended by JB in the alternate segment. 

But the angle between HB and JB is given as 116°, so that angle equals the angle subtended by JB in the alternate segment. 

Let me denote the angle subtended by JB in the alternate segment as θ. Then θ = 116°. This angle θ is the angle subtended by chord JB at the circumference in the alternate segment. 

But since the circle has point L on it, perhaps this angle relates to arc JL or something else. 

Alternatively, since the angle between tangent HB and chord JB is 116°, the angle in the alternate segment is 116°, which would mean that the arc opposite to this angle (in the alternate segment) is twice that angle, i.e., 232°, because the angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice the angle subtended at the circumference. 

Wait, but the angle in the alternate segment is an inscribed angle, so it would correspond to half the measure of the arc it subtends. Wait, no. The angle between the tangent and the chord is equal to the angle in the alternate segment, which is an inscribed angle. So if the angle between tangent and chord is θ, then the inscribed angle subtending the same arc is θ, and thus the arc measure is 2θ. 

So in this case, the angle between tangent HB and chord JB is 116°, which equals the inscribed angle subtended by arc JL (assuming L is the endpoint of the chord). Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact arc. 

Alternatively, the arc that is intercepted by the angle in the alternate segment. 

Let me visualize: the tangent at J, chord JB, and the alternate segment would be the arc that does not contain the point of tangency. So if the tangent is at J, and the chord is JB, then the alternate segment is the arc from J to B that doesn't contain the tangent line. But since J is the point of tangency, the arc would be from J to B, but since J is on the circle, the arc JB would be part of the circle. 

Wait, but the angle between the tangent and the chord JB is equal to the inscribed angle subtended by arc JB. Wait, no. The angle between tangent and chord is equal to the angle in the alternate segment, which is the angle subtended by the arc opposite to the angle. 

Let me refer to the Alternate Segment Theorem: the angle between the tangent and chord is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. So if the tangent is at J, and the chord is JB, then the angle between tangent HB and chord JB is equal to the angle subtended by arc JB in the alternate segment. 

So, if the angle between tangent HB and chord JB is 116°, then the inscribed angle subtended by arc JB in the alternate segment is 116°. Therefore, the arc measure corresponding to this angle is 2*116° = 232°. 

But this arc would be the arc from J to B that does not contain the point of tangency. Wait, but since J is on the circle, and B is a point on the tangent line, B may or may not be on the circle. Wait, but we don't know if B is on the circle. 

Wait, the only point we know on the circle is L. So, the arc in question would be from J to some point, but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, since the angle between tangent HB and chord JB is 116°, and this equals the inscribed angle subtended by arc JB. So the arc measure is 2*116° = 232°. 

Now, if we can relate this arc to the arc we need to find, which is arc JKL. 

Assuming that arc JKL is the arc from J to L passing through K, which would depend on the position of K. 

But we also have angle KJH = ? Let's see. 

We know that point K is on line EJ. So line EJ passes through J and K. And angle KJH is the angle at J between K and H. 

If we can express this angle in terms of arcs or other angles, it might help. 

But without knowing the exact position of K, it's challenging. However, since we have the angle between tangent HB and chord JB as 116°, and the arc JB is 232°, perhaps we can find relations. 

But I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think differently. 

Since the measure of arc JB is 232°, and the total circle is 360°, the remaining arc would be 360° - 232° = 128°. 

But this might not directly help. 

Alternatively, since we need to find the measure of arc JKL, which includes points J, K, L. 

Assuming that K is on line EJ, and L is on the circle. If we can relate angle KJH to some arc. 

But angle KJH is at J, between K and H. If we can relate this angle to arcs. 

Since K is on line EJ, and EJ is some line. If we can find the relationship between angle KJH and the arcs. 

Alternatively, since line HB is tangent at J, and we have angle between HB and JH, which is part of the angle KJH. 

Wait, angle KJH is at J, between K and H. So it's formed by lines JK and JH. 

If we can find this angle, it might relate to some arc. 

But we don't have direct information about angle KJH except that it's present. 

But the problem gives us angle HJB = 116°, and we need to find arc JKL. 

Maybe there's a relation between angle KJH and the arc JL or something. 

Alternatively, since K is on line EJ, and EJ is another line. But without knowing where E is, it's hard to say. 

This is quite tangled. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll try to make an educated guess based on the given answer choices and the angle of 116°. 

The arc measure related to the tangent-chord angle is 232°, which is double the angle between tangent and chord. Since 2*116=232. If this arc is part of the arc JKL, then maybe the answer is 232°, which is option C. 

Alternatively, since the angle at the center is twice the inscribed angle, but I'm not sure. 

Given that the angle between tangent and chord is 116°, which corresponds to an arc of 232°, and if this arc is the arc JKL, then the answer would be C. 

Therefore, I'll choose option C, 232°.
