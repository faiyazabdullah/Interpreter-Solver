MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have several points and lines defined, along with various angles and their measures. The question is which segments are parallel. The options are A to D, each suggesting different pairs of segments.

First, I need to parse all the given predicates. Let me list them out again:

Points: A, B, C, D, E.

Lines: AD, DE, EC, AB, BC, AE.

Angles mentioned:
- Angle(DAE) = 60 degrees.
- Angle(AEB) = 40 degrees.
- Angle( BEC ) = 80 degrees.
- Angle(ECB) = 60 degrees.
- Angle(DEB) = 70 degrees.

Wait, the angle names might be tricky. For example, Angle(D,A,E) means the angle at point A between points D and E. Similarly, Angle(A,E,B) is the angle at E between A and B. 

Let me try to visualize or sketch the figure based on these lines and angles. 

Starting with points connected by lines:

AD is a line, so points A and D are connected. Then DE connects to E, so D-E. Then E-C connects to C. Also, there's line AB, so A-B. Line BC connects B to C. Line AE connects A to E. 

So connecting these points:

A is connected to D, E, and B. 
E is connected to D, A, C, and B? Wait, because Angle(A,E,B) is mentioned, which would mean E is the vertex. Also, EC is a line, so E to C. And line EB? Not sure yet. 

But maybe it's better to think about the structure. Let me try to map out the connections:

- Points A connected to D, B, E.
- Point D connected to A, E.
- Point E connected to D, A, C, B?
Wait, line EC exists (so E to C), and line AE (A to E). Also, line BE? Because Angle(A,E,B) implies points A-E-B. So line EB is present? But the given lines are AB, BC, AE, DE, EC. Wait, line AB is given, so A-B. Line BC is given, so B-C. Line AE is given. So the line BE isn't explicitly stated unless inferred through other connections. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps some of these lines form triangles or polygons. Let me check if there are triangles here. For instance, triangle ADE, since lines AD, DE, EA exist. Also, triangle AEB (since lines AE, EB, AB?), but EB isn't listed as a line. Wait, but maybe EB is formed by the intersection of other lines? Or perhaps the angles given imply certain lines.

Alternatively, maybe looking at the angles can help us find relationships. Let's note down all the angles:

At point A: angle DAE is 60 degrees. That's the angle between DA and EA. Since DA and EA meet at A, forming angle 60°.

Then, angle AEB is 40 degrees. This is the angle at E between A and B. So, at point E, between points A and B. Which suggests that lines EA and EB form a 40-degree angle. Therefore, line EB exists, even though it's not explicitly named as a line. Maybe line EB is part of the figure, even if not directly given. But according to the initial list, the lines are AD, DE, EC, AB, BC, AE. So EB is not among the explicit lines. But since angle AEB is given, that implies that points A, E, B are connected via lines EA and EB. However, since AB is already a line, so points A-B are connected. Therefore, line EB must be part of the structure, even if not listed. Wait, but the problem says the given lines are those six. So maybe I should consider that line EB is not explicitly given but inferred through angles?

This could complicate things. Alternatively, maybe the lines are just the ones given, and the angles are formed by those lines. Let me think again.

For example, angle at E between A and B (angle AEB) would require that lines EA and EB exist. Since EA is given (line AE), and EB would be another line. But if EB is not one of the listed lines, how does that fit? Unless points B and E are connected via another line. Looking back, the given lines include AB and BC. So AB connects A-B, and BC connects B-C. So point B is connected to C. But where is E connected? From earlier, line EC exists, so E-C. Also, line DE exists (connecting D-E). So E is connected to D and C, and also to A (from line AE). Additionally, angle AEB implies that E is connected to B. Therefore, line EB must be present. But it's not listed among the given lines. Wait, but maybe there's a mistake here? Or perhaps I misread the given lines.

Wait, the user wrote:

"Line(A,D)
Line(D,E)
Line(E,C)
Line(A,B)
Line(B,C)
Line(A,E)"

So the lines are AD, DE, EC, AB, BC, AE. So line AE connects A-E. Line AB connects A-B. Line BC connects B-C. So line EB is not among the given lines. How can angle AEB exist then? Because angle AEB requires that lines EA and EB meet at E. Since EA is given, but EB is not a given line. So either there's a missing line, or perhaps the angle is formed by other lines?

Alternatively, maybe the angle at E between A and B is formed by lines ED and EB? Wait, but that's not necessarily. Alternatively, perhaps the lines EA and EB are parts of other structures. For example, maybe line EB is part of line BC? No, because BC connects B to C, and E is another point. Hmm. This seems confusing. Maybe I need to re-examine the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the angles given are not all at the same point. Let me recheck:

Angle(D,A,E): vertex at A, between D and E. So that's angle D-A-E, which is the angle at A between D and E. Given as 60 degrees.

Angle(A,E,B): vertex at E, between A and B. So angle A-E-B, which is at point E between A and B. Given as 40 degrees.

Angle(B,E,C): vertex at E, between B and C. So angle B-E-C, which is at point E between B and C. Given as 80 degrees.

Angle(E,C,B): vertex at C, between E and B. So angle E-C-B, which is at point C between E and B. Given as 60 degrees.

Angle(E,D,A): vertex at D, between E and A. So angle E-D-A, which is at point D between E and A. Given as 70 degrees.

So putting together these angles:

At point E, there are two angles: angle AEB (40°) and angle BEC (80°). These two angles at point E add up to 40 + 80 = 120 degrees. Since the sum of angles around a point is 360°, but if these are adjacent angles, they may form a larger angle. Wait, but depending on the configuration.

Also, at point D, there's angle EDA (70°), which is angle E-D-A. At point A, angle DAE (60°). At point C, angle ECB (60°).

Now, trying to reconstruct the figure. Let me attempt to imagine or draw the figure step by step.

Start with point A. Connected to D, B, and E. So A has three lines: AD, AB, AE.

From point D, connected to A and E (lines AD and DE). From point E, connected to D, A, and C (lines DE, AE, EC). From point C, connected to E and B (lines EC and BC). From point B, connected to A and C (lines AB and BC).

So the overall figure includes points A, B, C, D, E connected as follows:

- A connected to D, B, E.
- D connected to A, E.
- E connected to D, A, C.
- C connected to E, B.
- B connected to A, C.

Now, considering the angles:

At point A: angle DAE is 60°, which is between DA and EA.

At point E: angles involving E. Let's look at the angles at E:

- Angle AEB (40°): between EA and EB. But where is B connected to E? Since B is connected to A and C, and E is connected to A and C. So line EB is not directly given. But angle AEB implies that lines EA and EB meet at E. Since EA is present, but EB is not an explicit line. Perhaps line EB is part of the line BC? No, because BC goes from B to C, not to E. Alternatively, maybe there's a line from E to B? But that's not listed. Wait, but maybe the lines are not all the lines in the figure, but only the ones specified. So the presence of angle AEB suggests that there is a line EB, even if not explicitly listed. But the problem states that the lines are the ones given. So this is conflicting. 

Alternatively, maybe the angles are formed by intersecting lines. For example, line EB could be formed by the intersection of other lines. But without knowing where E is connected to B, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, maybe the lines AB and EC intersect somewhere? Not sure. This is getting complicated. 

Perhaps I should focus on the angles given and see if I can find any parallel lines based on angle relationships. Remember, parallel lines have corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, etc., equal.

Looking at the angles:

At point E, the angles are:

- Between A and B: 40°
- Between B and C: 80°
- So total of 120°, which leaves 240° for the remaining angles at E. But wait, the sum of angles around a point is 360°, so if there are other angles at E. Also, there's angle EDA (at D) being 70°, but that's at point D. 

Wait, but angle EDA is at point D, between E and A. So that's angle at D, between E and A. So that's angle EDA = 70°, which is part of triangle DEA. 

At point E, we have angles:

- AEB (40°)
- BEC (80°)
- Also, angle DEA (which is part of line DE and EA)? Wait, angle at E between D and A? Wait, angle EDA is at D, not E. So the angle at E between D and something else? Let me clarify:

The given angle EDA is angle at D between E and A. So that's angle EDA, which is 70°, as per the predicate Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(E,D,A)), 70). So angle at D, between E and A. 

Other angles at E:

- AEB (40°): at E between A and B.
- BEC (80°): at E between B and C.
- What about angle CED? Or other angles?

Since E is connected to D, A, and C. So the lines at E are ED, EA, and EC. So the angles at E would be between ED and EA, between EA and EC, and between EC and ED. But the given angles at E are:

- AEB: which is between EA and EB. But EB is not a line. So this is confusing. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the angle names? Like, maybe Angle(E,D,A) refers to the angle at D, which we've considered. 

Maybe I need to think differently. Let's consider the angles around point E. Since E is connected to D, A, and C. So the angles at E are:

Between ED and EA: which would be angle DEA (but that's at D). Wait, no. The angle between ED and EA at point E would be angle DEA? No, that's at point D. Wait, angle between ED and EA at point E would be angle AED. But according to the given, there's an angle at D called EDA (which is angle at D between E and A). 

Alternatively, maybe the angle between ED and EA is not given, but perhaps other angles. 

Given that, maybe focusing on triangle AEB. If angle AEB is 40°, and angle at E is 40°, but without knowing more about the triangle, it's hard to proceed. 

Another approach: look for pairs of lines that could be parallel based on the angles. For example, if two lines are cut by a transversal and the corresponding angles are equal, then the lines are parallel. 

Alternatively, if the sum of consecutive interior angles is 180°, then lines are parallel. 

But first, I need to identify which lines could be potential candidates for being parallel. The options are:

A. AB and CD
B. AD and BC
C. AD and BE
D. AE and BC

Assuming that BE is a line (even though not explicitly listed, since angle AEB is given), perhaps BE is a line that needs to be considered. 

Let me consider each option:

Option B: AD and BC. Are these lines parallel? To check, we'd need to find if corresponding angles are equal when crossed by a transversal. Suppose AD and BC are cut by a transversal. But without knowing which lines are transversals, it's unclear. 

Alternatively, maybe looking at the angles around the figure. For example, if two lines are parallel, then their slopes would be equal. But since we don't have coordinates, we need to use angle relationships. 

Another idea: Check for supplementary angles or equal angles that indicate parallelism. 

Looking at the angles given:

At point A: angle DAE is 60°. At point E: angle AEB is 40°, angle BEC is 80°. At point C: angle ECB is 60°. Also, angle EDC is 70° (the angle at D between E and A). 

Wait, let's consider triangle AEB. In this triangle, we know angle at E is 40°, but do we know other angles? If we can find other angles, maybe we can relate them to other parts. 

Similarly, triangle BEC has angle at E of 80°, and angle at C is 60°, so maybe we can find angle at B? 

In triangle BEC: angles at E is 80°, at C is 60°, so angle at B would be 180 - 80 - 60 = 40°. So angle at B in triangle BEC is 40°. 

Now, angle at B in triangle BEC is angle EBC = 40°. 

Now, looking at triangle ABC. If we can find its angles, maybe we can compare. 

But point B is connected to A and C. Also, point E is connected to B. So maybe line BE is involved. 

Wait, if angle EBC is 40°, and angle AEB is 40°, maybe there's some relationship here. 

Suppose lines AD and BC are parallel. If that were true, then the corresponding angles formed by a transversal would be equal. For instance, if a transversal crosses AD and BC, then the angles would be equal. 

Alternatively, if lines AD and BC are parallel, then the angles made by a transversal like AB would have corresponding angles. 

Alternatively, considering triangle ABD and something else... 

Alternatively, since angle DAE is 60°, and angle ECB is 60°, which are at different points. If these angles are corresponding angles, then maybe AD and BC are parallel. 

Wait, angle DAE is at point A, between DA and AE. Angle ECB is at point C, between EC and CB. If these angles are corresponding angles, then lines AD and BC would be parallel. But for that, the transversal would need to be AE and EC. 

Wait, if lines AD and BC are parallel, and transversal AE intersects them, creating corresponding angles. But angle DAE is at A, while angle at C would need to be a corresponding angle. 

Alternatively, if we consider line AE as a transversal cutting AD and BC. But line AE starts at A and goes to E. Where does it intersect BC? It depends on the configuration. 

Alternatively, think about the angles formed by other lines. 

Alternatively, let's consider the angles at E. We have angle AEB = 40°, angle BEC = 80°, and angle EDC = 70° (the angle at D between E and A). 

Wait, angle at D, angle EDA is 70°, which is part of triangle ADE. In triangle ADE, we know angle at A is 60°, angle at D is 70°, so angle at E (in triangle ADE) would be 180 - 60 - 70 = 50°. 

So in triangle ADE, angle at E is 50°. 

But earlier, we had angle AEB = 40°, which is at point E between A and B. So if angle at E in triangle ADE is 50°, and angle AEB is 40°, then perhaps angle between DE and BE is 50° - 40° = 10°? Not sure. 

Alternatively, if angle between DE and BE is 10°, but this is speculative. 

But maybe we can find more angles. For instance, in triangle BEC, we found angle at B is 40°, as previously noted. 

Now, considering line BC, which connects B to C. If we can find angles related to BC, perhaps we can compare with other lines. 

Alternatively, let's consider the sum of angles around point E. At point E, we have angles:

- AEB = 40°
- BEC = 80°
- And angle between EC and ED? Let me think. 

Point E is connected to D, A, and C. So the angles around E would be:

Between ED and EA: angle DEA? Wait, that's at D. Wait, the angles at E are between ED and EA, between EA and EC, and between EC and ED. But we only have some of these angles given. 

We know angle AEB is 40°, which is between EA and EB. But if there's a line EB, then angle between EA and EB is 40°, and between EB and EC is 80°, making the total angle around E up to 120°, leaving 240° for the rest. But this doesn't seem helpful. 

Alternatively, if we assume that the line EB forms part of the figure, then the angle between ED and EB would be angle DEB, which is given as 70°. Wait, the predicate Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,E,B)), 70). So angle at E between D and B is 70°. 

Ah! So angle at E between D and B is 70°, which would be angle DEB. So this suggests that at point E, the angles are:

- Between D and B: 70°
- Between B and C: 80°
- Between C and D: ?

Wait, but the sum of angles around point E should be 360°. So if angle DEB is 70°, angle BEC is 80°, and the remaining angle would be between ED and EC? Or is there another angle? 

Wait, if the lines at E are ED, EB, and EC, then the angles around E would be:

- Between ED and EB: 70°
- Between EB and EC: 80°
- Between EC and ED: ?

Summing these gives 70 + 80 + angle(EDC) = 150 + angle(EDC) = 360 → angle(EDC) = 210°, which is impossible because angles in a plane around a point should sum to 360°, but individual angles can't exceed 180°. This suggests an error in my understanding. 

Wait, no—this indicates that my assumption about the angles around E is incorrect. Let me reconsider. 

If the lines at E are ED, EA, and EC, then the angles between them would be:

- Between ED and EA: angle DEA (but that's at D).
Wait, no. The angle between ED and EA at point E is angle DEA? No, that's at point D. The angle between ED and EA at point E is angle AED. 

But the given angle at E between D and B is 70°, which is angle DEB. So that's between ED and EB. Then, angle between EB and EC is angle BEC = 80°, and angle between EC and ED would be the remaining angle. 

So total of angles around E: angle DEB (70°) + angle BEC (80°) + angle CED (unknown) = 360°. Wait, but that would require angle CED = 360 - 70 - 80 = 210°, which is impossible. Hence, this suggests that my previous assumption is wrong. 

Alternatively, maybe the lines at E are ED, EA, and EC, but the angles are between ED and EA, EA and EC, and EC and ED. So:

- Angle between ED and EA: let's call it x
- Angle between EA and EC: y
- Angle between EC and ED: z
Such that x + y + z = 360°? No, because around a point, the sum is 360°, but these angles would be the reflex angles or non-reflex. 

But if we have angle DEB = 70°, which is between ED and EB. So EB is a line from E to B. Assuming that EB divides the space around E into two parts: one between ED and EB (70°), and another between EB and ... ? 

But without knowing the full configuration, it's challenging. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding in how the angles are measured. 

Let me try to think of this as a diagram. Let's suppose that point E is connected to D, A, and C. So three lines: ED, EA, EC. Now, if there's another line from E to B, making four lines from E: ED, EA, EC, EB. But the given lines are only ED, EA, EC, and others. 

Wait, but the given lines are AD, DE, EC, AB, BC, AE. So line EB is not explicitly given. However, angle AEB is given, which implies that lines EA and EB meet at E. Therefore, line EB must exist, even if not listed. So this line EB is part of the figure. Thus, at point E, we have four lines: ED, EA, EB, EC. 

Thus, the angles around E would be:

- Between ED and EA: let's say α
- Between EA and EB: β = 40° (given)
- Between EB and EC: γ = 80° (given)
- Between EC and ED: δ

These four angles around point E sum to 360°, so α + β + γ + δ = 360°. 

But we also have angle DEB = 70°, which is the angle between ED and EB. That would be α + β = 70°, assuming α is the angle between ED and EA, and β is between EA and EB. So α + β = 70°. 

Given β = 40°, then α = 70° - 40° = 30°. 

Therefore, α = 30°, which is the angle between ED and EA at point E. 

Now, we have γ = 80° (between EB and EC), and δ is the angle between EC and ED. 

Total of α + β + γ + δ = 30 + 40 + 80 + δ = 150 + δ = 360 → δ = 210°. This is still problematic because δ would be a reflex angle (greater than 180°), which is possible, but unusual. 

However, maybe there's another way to interpret angle DEB. If angle DEB is between ED and EB, which could be a reflex angle, but typically angles are measured as the smaller angle unless specified otherwise. So if angle DEB is 70°, it's likely the smaller angle, implying that the actual angle between ED and EB is 70°, and the reflex angle is 360 - 70 = 290°. But this complicates things further. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle DEB is referring to a different configuration. Let me think differently. 

If we consider triangle ADE, where angle at A is 60°, angle at D is 70°, then angle at E (in triangle ADE) is 50°, as calculated before. 

But this angle at E in triangle ADE is between ED and EA, which would be α = 30°, as calculated earlier. Wait, contradiction here. Earlier calculation said α = 30°, but in triangle ADE, the angle at E is 50°. This inconsistency suggests an error in assumptions. 

Wait, let me recalculate. In triangle ADE, the angles are:

At A: 60° (given).

At D: angle EDA = 70° (given).

Therefore, angle at E (in triangle ADE) is 180 - 60 - 70 = 50°. 

But earlier, we thought that angle between ED and EA at E (which is part of triangle ADE) is α = 30°, which contradicts this. So where is the error?

Ah! Here's the confusion: The angle at E in triangle ADE is the angle between ED and EA, which is angle AED. But earlier, we assumed that angle between ED and EA at E is α = 30°, but according to triangle ADE, it should be 50°. This implies that our earlier calculation was wrong. 

Where did the 30° come from? Earlier, I thought that angle DEB (which is between ED and EB) is 70°, and angle AEB is 40°, leading to α = 30°. But this assumes that angle between ED and EB is composed of α (between ED and EA) and β (between EA and EB). But if α is actually 50°, then β = 40°, and angle DEB would be α + β = 50 + 40 = 90°, but the given angle DEB is 70°. This contradiction indicates a fundamental flaw in the assumptions. 

This suggests that my interpretation of the angles is incorrect. Let me revisit the given predicates. 

The given angle DEB is MeasureOf(Angle(D,E,B)) = 70°. This means the angle at E between D and B is 70°. So this is the angle between ED and EB, not including EA. 

Previously, I incorrectly assumed that this angle DEB is composed of alpha and beta, but if angle DEB is between ED and EB, then it's a single angle of 70°, independent of other angles. 

So, at point E, we have:

- Angle between ED and EB: 70° (given)
- Angle between EB and EC: 80° (given)
- Angle between EC and ED: ?

And also, in triangle ADE, angle at E is 50°, which is the angle between ED and EA. So this angle AED is 50°, which is between ED and EA. 

Thus, the angle between ED and EA is 50°, and the angle between ED and EB is 70°. So the angle between EA and EB would be 70° - 50° = 20°? Or is it adding? 

Wait, if ED and EA make an angle of 50°, and ED and EB make an angle of 70°, then the angle between EA and EB would be 70° - 50° = 20°. But the given angle AEB is 40°, which contradicts this. 

Hmm, this is very confusing. There must be a miscalculation. Let me try again. 

Let me denote:

At point E:

- The angle between ED and EB is 70° (given).
- The angle between EB and EC is 80° (given).
- The angle between EC and ED is x.
- Also, in triangle ADE, the angle at E is between ED and EA, which is 50° (as calculated from triangle ADE).

So, the angle between ED and EA is 50°. Now, if the angle between ED and EB is 70°, then the angle between EA and EB would be |70° - 50°| = 20°, assuming they're on the same side. But the given angle AEB is 40°, which contradicts this. 

This suggests that the angle between EA and EB is 40°, as given. So, if angle between EA and EB is 40°, and angle between ED and EB is 70°, then the angle between ED and EA is 70° - 40° = 30°. But earlier, from triangle ADE, it's 50°. Contradiction again. 

This implies that there's an inconsistency in the given data or my understanding of the setup. But since the problem is given, it must be consistent. So I must have made a mistake in interpreting the angles. 

Let me start over, carefully. 

Given:

- Angle(D,A,E) = 60°: at point A, between D and E. So angle DAE = 60°.
- Angle(A,E,B) = 40°: at point E, between A and B. So angle AEB = 40°.
- Angle(B,E,C) = 80°: at point E, between B and C. So angle BEC = 80°.
- Angle(E,C,B) = 60°: at point C, between E and B. So angle ECB = 60°.
- Angle(E,D,A) = 70°: at point D, between E and A. So angle EDA = 70°.

Wait, the last one is Angle(E,D,A) = 70°, which is at point D, between E and A. So angle at D: EDA = 70°. 

So, let's focus on triangle ADE: points A, D, E. Angles at A: 60°, at D: 70°, so angle at E (angle AED) is 50°. 

Now, at point E, we have angle AED = 50°, which is between ED and EA. 

Additionally, at point E, we have angle AEB = 40° (between EA and EB) and angle BEC = 80° (between EB and EC). 

So, starting from EA, going to EB is 40°, then from EB to EC is 80°, making a total angle from EA to EC of 40 + 80 = 120°. 

Now, what about the angle between ED and EC? Let's see. 

At point E, the angle between ED and EA is 50°, and the angle between EA and EC is 120°, so the angle between ED and EC would be 50° + 120° = 170°, if they are on opposite sides. But this is speculative. 

Alternatively, if ED and EC are on the same side of EA, then the angle between ED and EC would be |50° - 120°| = 70°. 

But this is getting too vague without a diagram. 

Let me try to consider the possibility that lines AD and BC are parallel. If AD || BC, then the corresponding angles would be equal. For example, if a transversal cuts them, the corresponding angles would be equal. 

Looking at angle at A: 60° (DAE), and if BC is parallel to AD, then perhaps there's a corresponding angle at B. 

Alternatively, since angle at C is 60° (ECB), and if BC is parallel to AD, then maybe angle at C corresponds to angle at A. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, let's consider the sum of angles in a polygon. For example, if AD is parallel to BC, then the figure might form a trapezoid, and certain angle sums would hold. 

Alternatively, let's think about the angles at points A and C. Angle at A is 60°, angle at C is 60° (from angle ECB = 60°). If these are corresponding angles, then AD and BC could be parallel. 

But this is speculative. 

Alternatively, let's consider the angles around point E. 

We know angle AEB = 40°, angle BEC = 80°, and angle EDA = 70° (at D). 

If we can find another angle that relates to these, maybe we can find parallel lines. 

Another approach: Use the fact that if two lines are parallel, then the sum of the interior angles on the same side of a transversal is 180°. 

For example, if AD and BC are parallel, and AB is a transversal, then angle at A (60°) and angle at B would need to be supplementary. 

But what is the angle at B? 

In triangle BEC, we had angle at B as 40° (earlier calculation). If that's the case, then 60° + 40° = 100° ≠ 180°, so AD and BC are not parallel. 

Alternatively, if angle at B is something else. 

Wait, in triangle BEC, angles at E is 80°, at C is 60°, so angle at B is 40°, as before. 

So if AB is a transversal, and AD || BC, then angle at A (60°) and angle at B (40°) would need to be supplementary, but they aren't. Hence, AD and BC are not parallel. 

What about AE and BC? If AE and BC are parallel, then the corresponding angles would be equal. 

Angle at A is 60°, and if there's a corresponding angle at B. But what angle at B? 

If AE || BC, and AB is a transversal, then angle at A (60°) would correspond to angle at B. But angle at B is 40°, which doesn't match. 

Alternatively, if line EC is a transversal. 

Alternatively, consider triangle ABE and some relation to BC. 

This is getting too tangled. Let me think about the given options again. 

Option D: AE and BC are parallel. 

To check if AE || BC, we need to find if the corresponding angles are equal. 

For example, if there's a transversal that intersects both AE and BC, creating equal corresponding angles. 

Suppose line EC is a transversal. At point E, angle between AE and EC is angle AEC. At point C, angle between EC and BC is angle ECB = 60°. If these angles are equal, then AE || BC. 

But what is angle AEC? 

At point E, angle between AE and EC: let's calculate. 

Earlier, we had at point E, angle between ED and EA is 50° (from triangle ADE), and angle between ED and EB is 70°, angle between EB and EC is 80°. 

If we can find the angle between AE and EC, which is angle AEC. 

Assuming that from EA, going to EC passes through EB. So angle AEB = 40°, angle BEC = 80°, so total angle AEC = 40 + 80 = 120°. 

So angle AEC = 120°. 

If AE || BC, then the angle between EC and BC (which is 60°) should be equal to the angle between AE and EC (120°). But 120° ≠ 60°, so they are not equal. Hence, AE and BC are not parallel. 

Option C: AD and BE are parallel. 

To check this, let's see if corresponding angles are equal. 

If AD || BE, then the angle between AD and AB at A should equal the angle between BE and AB at B. 

Angle at A: angle DAB. Wait, what is angle DAB? 

Point A is connected to D and B. So angle DAB is the angle at A between DA and BA. 

From the given, angle DAE is 60°, which is between DA and EA. If we can find angle between DA and BA, which is angle DAB. 

But without knowing the exact position of B relative to DA, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, if AD || BE, then the corresponding angles formed by transversal AB would be equal. 

Angle at A between DA and AB would correspond to angle at B between BE and AB. 

But what is angle at B between BE and AB? That would be angle ABE. 

If we can find angle ABE, and compare it to angle DAB. 

From earlier, in triangle BEC, angle at B is 40°, which is angle EBC. 

But angle ABE is part of that. If line BE is connected to B, then angle ABE is part of triangle ABE. 

In triangle ABE, we know angle at E is 40°, and if we can find other angles. 

But without knowing more, it's difficult. 

Alternatively, let's consider that if AD || BE, then the slope of AD equals the slope of BE. But since we don't have coordinates, this is abstract. 

Alternatively, using the angles at E. 

If AD || BE, then the angle between AD and AE would equal the angle between BE and AE, but that's not necessarily true. 

This is getting too vague. Let me think of another approach. 

Let me summarize the given angles and see if any of them suggest parallel lines. 

We have:

- Angle at A: 60° (DAE)
- Angle at E: 40° (AEB), 80° (BEC), 70° (DEB)
- Angle at C: 60° (ECB)
- Angle at D: 70° (EDA)

Now, if two lines are parallel, their corresponding angles should be equal. 

Looking at angle at A (60°) and angle at C (60°). If these are corresponding angles, then AD and BC could be parallel. 

But for corresponding angles, the lines need to be cut by a transversal. 

For example, if line AC is a transversal cutting AD and BC, then the angles at A and C would be corresponding. 

But angle at A is 60°, and angle at C is 60°, so this suggests that AD || BC. 

This would make option B (AD and BC) the correct answer. 

But why is angle at C 60°? It's angle ECB, which is at point C between E and B. So if line BC is extended, and line AD is parallel to BC, then the angle at C (60°) would correspond to the angle at A (60°), confirming the parallelism. 

This seems plausible. 

Thus, the correct answer would be B: AD and BC are parallel.
