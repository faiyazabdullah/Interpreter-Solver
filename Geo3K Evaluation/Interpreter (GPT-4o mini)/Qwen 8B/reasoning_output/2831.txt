Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have points A, B, C, D, E, F. There's a circle with center E because PointLiesOnCircle(B, Circle(E)) and PointLiesOnCircle(C, Circle(E)). So, points B and C lie on a circle centered at E. That means EB and EC are radii of the circle. Wait, but the length of EB is given as 15 units, and EC is 12 units? Wait, hold on. Wait, the Equals(LengthOf(Line(B, E)), 15) says that BE is 15. And Equals(LengthOf(Line(E, C)), 12) says EC is 12. But if B and C are both on the same circle centered at E, then their distances from E should be equal, right? Because all radii of a circle are equal. But here, BE is 15 and EC is 12. That seems contradictory. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake here? Or perhaps I misread something?

Wait, let me check again. The predicates say:

PointLiesOnCircle(B, Circle(E)): so B is on the circle with center E. Similarly, PointLiesOnCircle(C, Circle(E)): so C is also on the same circle. Therefore, both B and C are on the circle centered at E. Thus, EB and EC should both be radii, hence equal in length. However, the given lengths are BE = 15 and EC = 12. That's impossible unless the circle isn't centered at E? Wait, no—because the circle is defined as Circle(E), so the center is E. Therefore, this suggests that either there's a typo in the problem, or I'm misunderstanding something. Alternatively, maybe one of them is not on the circle? Wait, but the predicates explicitly state that B and C lie on Circle(E). 

This inconsistency needs to be resolved. Maybe it's a trick question where the circle isn't actually a standard circle? Or perhaps there's another interpretation. Wait, could there be two different circles? No, the problem mentions "Circle(E)" once, implying a single circle. Hmm. This seems like a contradiction. Unless... wait, maybe the points B and C are not both on the same circle? But the predicate says PointLiesOnCircle(B, Circle(E)) and PointLiesOnCircle(C, Circle(E)), so both are on the same circle. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding about the notation. For example, maybe Line(E, C) refers to something else? Wait, the Line(E, C) is mentioned as part of the predicates. Also, Secant(Line(D, C), Circle(E))—so the line DC is a secant of the circle centered at E. 

But back to the radius issue. If BE is 15 and EC is 12, then the circle cannot have both B and C on its circumference unless E is not the center. Wait, but the circle is named as Circle(E), so E must be the center. Therefore, this seems conflicting. Unless the problem has a mistake, but assuming it's correctly formulated, perhaps there's another way. Wait, maybe the line EC is not a radius? Wait, if point C lies on the circle centered at E, then EC would be a radius. Therefore, EC should equal the radius. Similarly, BE would be the radius. So both BE and EC should be equal. But according to the given data, BE=15 and EC=12. That's impossible. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here. 

Wait, maybe the circle isn't centered at E? Wait, the problem says "Circle(E)", which usually denotes a circle with center E. But maybe in some contexts, it's different? Or perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the predicate names. Let me check the original problem again. 

Looking back: "PointLiesOnCircle(B, Circle(E))" implies that B lies on the circle whose center is E. Similarly for C. So, yes, E is the center. Then, BE and EC are radii, so they should be equal. But the problem states BE = 15 and EC = 12. Contradiction. Unless the problem has a typo, but since we have to work with the given info, perhaps I need to consider that maybe E is not the center? But that contradicts the predicate name. 

Alternatively, maybe E is not the center, but the circle is defined differently. Wait, but the circle is called Circle(E), which typically indicates the center is E. Unless the notation is different. Maybe the circle is named after E, but the center is another point? For example, sometimes circles are denoted by their center, but maybe in this case, the circle is named after E, but the actual center is another point. But that's non-standard. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different convention where the circle is defined by three points? Like, if E is a point on the circle? But then the circle would have a different center. But the problem says "Circle(E)", so that's confusing. 

This seems like a critical issue. Without resolving this, proceeding further is difficult. Perhaps the problem assumes that even though B and C are on the circle, their distances from E are given as 15 and 12, implying that E is not the center. Wait, but then how can B and C lie on the circle? If E is not the center, then the circle's center would be some other point, say O. But the problem says Circle(E), so maybe there's confusion in notation. 

Alternatively, maybe the circle is centered at E, but points B and C are not on the circle? But the predicate says they are. This is very confusing. 

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. Let me try to think differently. Suppose that despite the contradiction, proceed with the given numbers. Maybe the problem is designed such that E is not the center, but the circle passes through B and C, and E is just another point. Wait, but then the circle's center is not E. So, for instance, suppose there is a circle passing through B and C, with center somewhere else. But the problem says Circle(E), which is supposed to define the circle's center as E. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different notation where Circle(E) refers to a circle with radius E? No, that doesn't make sense. 

This seems like a fundamental conflict. However, given that this is a problem to be solved, perhaps I should assume that there's a typo, and that the lengths are meant to be consistent. For example, maybe the length of BE is 12 and EC is 15? Or perhaps the circle has different radii? But that would require more information. 

Alternatively, maybe the line EC is not a radius but a chord? Wait, if point C is on the circle centered at E, then EC is a radius. So, if EC is 12, then the radius is 12. But BE is 15, which would imply that B is outside the circle. But the predicate says that B lies on the circle. Hence, this is impossible. 

This contradiction suggests that perhaps there's an error in the problem setup. However, since I have to proceed, maybe I should consider that the circle is not centered at E, but instead, E is a point on the circle. Let me try that assumption. 

Assume that the circle is not centered at E, but E is a point on the circle. Then, points B and C are also on the circle. So, the circle has center somewhere else, say O, and E is a point on the circumference. In this case, BE and EC are chords of the circle. But then the problem states "Circle(E)", which is unclear. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to use a different notation where the circle is defined by its center and radius, but the notation is misused. For example, maybe the circle has center E and radius EC = 12, making BE = 15. But that would mean that BE is longer than the radius, placing B outside the circle, contradicting the predicate that B is on the circle. 

At this point, I'm stuck. However, since the problem includes a secant line DC intersecting the circle, and points D, F, etc., maybe I need to focus on other parts. Let me try to visualize the diagram based on the given lines. 

Lines: 
- Line(B, A): connects B to A.
- Line(A, D): connects A to D.
- Line(E, C): connects E to C.
- Line(E, B): connects E to B.
- Secant(Line(D, C), Circle(E)): the line DC intersects the circle at two points. Since it's a secant, DC passes through the circle, entering at one point and exiting at another. 

Also, LengthOf(Line(B,E)) is 15, LengthOf(Line(E,C)) is 12, LengthOf(Line(A,D)) is x (what we need to find), and LengthOf(Line(D,F)) is 8. 

Assuming that there's a way to resolve the earlier contradiction, maybe I should proceed with the given lengths and see. 

Let me consider that E is the center of the circle. Then, since B and C are on the circle, EB and EC are radii. Therefore, they should be equal. But the given values are 15 and 12. This inconsistency suggests that perhaps the problem has a mistake, but maybe I need to proceed by treating them as separate entities. 

Alternatively, maybe the circle is not unique, and there are two circles? But the problem mentions only one circle, Circle(E). 

Alternatively, maybe E is not the center but another point. For example, if E is a point inside the circle, then BE and EC could be different. But then the circle's center would be elsewhere. 

This is getting too convoluted. Perhaps I should look for other clues. The secant line DC intersects the circle. So, DC is a secant line. Points D and C are connected by a line that cuts through the circle. Given that C is on the circle, so DC starts at point D, goes through C, which is on the circle. So, DC is a secant line passing through the circle, entering at some point and exiting at C. Wait, but since C is already on the circle, the line DC intersects the circle at least at C. If it's a secant, then it must intersect at two points. So, DC passes through the circle twice. One of those points is C, so the other intersection point is another point. 

Now, considering the power of a point theorem. The Power of a Point theorem relates the lengths of segments created by a secant line. Specifically, if a line passes through a circle and intersects it at two points, say X and Y, then for a point D outside the circle, the product of the distances from D to each intersection point equals the square of the tangent length from D to the circle. 

In this case, since DC is a secant, and C is on the circle, then if D is outside the circle, the power of point D with respect to the circle is equal to (DC)(DA) where DA is the segment from D to the second intersection point. Wait, but we know that DC is a secant passing through C and another point. However, since C is on the circle, then DC would be from D to C, and the other intersection point would be another point, say G. So, power of D is DG * DC = (distance from D to center squared minus radius squared). But without knowing where D is located, it's hard to apply directly. 

However, we also have the line AD, which connects A to D. Additionally, there's a line AE, since E is connected to B and C. Also, Line(E, C) is given. 

Wait, perhaps triangle EBC? Since B and C are on the circle centered at E (assuming that despite the previous contradiction). Even though EB=15 and EC=12, if we treat them as radii, then BC would be the distance between B and C on the circle. Using the Law of Cosines, BC² = EB² + EC² - 2*EB*EC*cos(theta), where theta is the angle at E. But without knowing theta, we can't compute BC. However, maybe there's another relation. 

Alternatively, if we consider the line DC being a secant, and D being connected to A. If we can find relations involving AD and DC, then we might use the power of point D. 

Power of a point D with respect to the circle is equal to DC * DD', where D' is the other intersection point. But since DC is a secant, and C is on the circle, then if D is outside, the formula would be DC * DE = (tangent)^2. Wait, no—the power of point D is equal to (length of tangent from D to circle)^2, and also equal to DC * DD', where DC is the entire secant segment from D to the first intersection point (say, C), and DD' is from D to the second intersection point. Wait, actually, the formula is that if a secant from D passes through the circle, intersecting it at X and Y, then DX * DY = power of D. 

So, if the secant passes through C and another point, say G, then DC * DG = power of D. But since C is on the circle, DG would be DC + CG? Or depends on the order. 

Assuming that D is outside the circle, and the secant passes through C (on the circle) and another point, say G. Then, the power of D is DC * DG. But since C is on the circle, DG would be DC extended beyond C to G, so DG = DC + CG? Wait, no—if D is outside, and the line passes through C (on the circle), then the secant would go from D through C to another point G on the circle. So, the power of D is DC * DG, where DC is the distance from D to C, and DG is the distance from D to G. But since C is between D and G, then DG = DC + CG. But since CG is the distance from C to G along the line, which is a chord of the circle. However, without knowing where G is, this might not help. 

Alternatively, if D is inside the circle, then the power of D would be negative, and the formula would be DC * DG = -(power), but I think the general formula is that for any point D, the product of the distances from D to the two intersection points is equal to the power of D. 

But how does this help us? We need more information about the position of D relative to the circle. 

Additionally, there's a line AD connecting A to D, and we're told that the length of AD is x, which we need to find. Also, DF is 8 units. 

Perhaps there are other relationships. Let me try to consider coordinates. Assign coordinates to simplify. 

Let me place point E at the origin (0,0) since it's the center of the circle. Then, points B and C lie on the circle. But given that EB=15 and EC=12, which conflicts with the idea that they are radii. So, if I take E as the center, then the radius should be the same for B and C. But since EB=15 and EC=12, this suggests that either the circle isn't centered at E, or there's an error. 

Alternatively, maybe E is not the center but another point. Suppose that the circle has center O, and E is a point on the circle. Then, points B and C are also on the circle. So, EB and EC are chords of the circle. 

Let me try this approach. Assume that the circle has center O, and E is a point on the circle. Then, points B and C are also on the circle. Now, the length EB=15 and EC=12. These are chords of the circle. 

Then, the line DC is a secant of the circle. Point D is connected to A and C. Also, there's a line from E to B and E to C. 

This seems complicated, but maybe we can use the power of point D with respect to the circle. 

Power of D = DB * DA = DC * DG, where DB and DA are segments of a secant, but I need to clarify. 

Wait, if D is outside the circle, and DC is a secant passing through the circle, then the power of D is DC * DG, where DG is the entire length from D to the second intersection point. However, since C is one intersection point, and assuming that DC is from D to C, then DG would be DC plus CG, where CG is the extension beyond C. But without knowing where G is, this is tricky. 

Alternatively, if D is inside the circle, then the power of D is negative, and the formula is DC * DG = -(power), but again, without knowing where D is located, this is challenging. 

But we also have line AD, with length x, and DF=8. Perhaps there's a relationship between these. 

Another thought: since E is connected to B and C, and B and C are on the circle, maybe triangle EBC has sides EB=15, EC=12, and BC. But without knowing BC, this might not help. 

Wait, if I can find BC, then maybe using the Law of Cosines in triangle EBC. But without knowing the angle at E, it's not helpful. 

Alternatively, if I consider that DC is a secant, and D is connected to A, which is connected to B via line AB. 

Maybe there's a right triangle involved? For example, if line AE is perpendicular to something? Not sure. 

Alternatively, since there's a line from E to C (which is a radius if E were the center), but since we've assumed E is not the center, this line EC is just a chord. 

This is getting too tangled. Let me try to focus on the power of point D. 

Assume that D is outside the circle, and DC is a secant intersecting the circle at C and another point, say G. Then, the power of D is DC * DG = DT^2, where DT is the length of the tangent from D to the circle. 

But we don't know DT. However, there's another segment mentioned: DF=8. Is DF a tangent? The problem says "segments that appear to be tangent are tangent." So, if DF is tangent to the circle, then DF^2 = power of D. 

Therefore, if DF is tangent, then power of D = DF^2 = 8^2 = 64. 

Thus, DC * DG = 64. 

But DG = DC + CG if C is between D and G. Assuming that, then DG = DC + CG. But without knowing CG, this is still not enough. 

However, if we can express CG in terms of other quantities. 

Alternatively, if D is inside the circle, then the power of D is negative, and the formula becomes DC * DG = - (power), but since power is negative, it would be DC * DG = |power|. 

But how does this help? 

Alternatively, if we can find another expression for the power of D. 

For example, if there's another secant or tangent from D. 

But we have DF as a tangent, so DF^2 = power of D. 

And also, if DC is a secant, then DC * DG = power of D. 

Thus, combining these: DF^2 = DC * DG => 64 = DC * DG. 

But we need to relate this to other parts. 

Now, what is DG? It depends on where G is. But if we can find DG in terms of other segments. 

Alternatively, if the line DC passes through C and extends to G, and if there's a relation between DG and other lengths. 

But without more info, it's hard to say. 

Wait, but there's also line AD. The length of AD is x, which we need to find. 

Is there a way to connect AD with DC? For example, if A is the intersection of lines AB and AD, and maybe there's a relation between AD and DC? 

Also, line AB connects A to B. Line AE connects E to B. Wait, there's a line from E to B, which is given. 

Perhaps triangle ABE? 

But I'm not sure. Let me try to imagine the diagram. 

Points: 

- Circle with center E (though this may be incorrect due to earlier contradictions).

- Points B and C on the circle.

- Lines: BA, AD, EC, EB.

- Secant DC intersects the circle.

- DF is a tangent of length 8.

Assuming DF is tangent, then power of D is DF^2 = 64. 

If DC is a secant, then DC * DG = 64. 

But we need to find x, which is AD. How to connect AD with DC? 

Perhaps AD is part of the secant? Or maybe there's a triangle involving AD and DC? 

Alternatively, if A is the external point, and AD is a segment from A to D, which is connected to C. 

Wait, if A is connected to D, and D is connected to C, then AD and DC are parts of the same line? No, because AD is from A to D, and DC is from D to C. So, if A, D, and C are colinear, then AC would be AD + DC. But we don't know if they are colinear. 

Wait, the line AD is given, and DC is another line. Are they connected? 

From the given predicates: Line(A, D) exists, and Line(D, C) exists. So, point D is connected to A and to C. So, points A, D, C form a path. But whether they are colinear depends on the configuration. 

If A, D, and C are colinear, then AC = AD + DC, but we don't know. 

Alternatively, if there's a triangle ADC, with AD=x, DC=?, and AC=?. 

But without more info, it's hard to tell. 

Wait, but if we can relate AD to DC via the power of point D. 

Suppose that D is outside the circle, and the line DC is a secant, while AD is another line from D to A. But how does A relate to the circle? 

Point A is connected to B via Line(B, A). Also, Line(A, D) exists. 

If A is outside the circle, then maybe there's another secant or tangent from A. 

But we don't have information about that. 

Alternatively, if A is inside the circle, then the power of A would be negative. 

This is getting too vague. Let me try to think differently. 

Since the problem gives us BE=15 and EC=12, and assuming that despite the contradiction, we proceed. Let's say that BE=15 and EC=12, and E is the center. Then, the radius of the circle is 15 (since B is on the circle), but EC=12 would suggest that C is inside the circle, which contradicts the predicate that C is on the circle. So, this is impossible. 

But if we ignore that contradiction and proceed, perhaps there's a way. For example, if E is the center, and B is on the circle (radius 15), and C is a point such that EC=12, which would mean C is inside the circle. Then, the line EC would be from E (center) to C (inside), and the line DC is a secant passing through C. 

In this case, the power of point D with respect to the circle would be DC * DG = DT^2, where DT is the tangent from D to the circle. 

Given that DF is a tangent, DF=8, so DT=8. Hence, DC * DG = 64. 

But we need to find DC in terms of AD=x. 

If we can express DG in terms of DC and other lengths. 

Assuming that D is outside the circle, and the line DC passes through C (inside the circle), then the secant would pass through C and extend to another point G on the circle. So, DC is from D to C, and CG is from C to G. Then, DG = DC + CG. 

But how do we find CG? 

Alternatively, if the line DC passes through C and exits the circle at another point, say G. Then, the power of D is DC * DG = 64. 

But without knowing where G is, this is challenging. 

However, if we can relate CG to other elements. For example, if line EC is from E (center) to C (inside the circle), and if line DC passes through C, then perhaps there's a relation between EC and DC. 

Alternatively, if we consider triangle ECD. 

But without knowing angles or other sides, this is difficult. 

Wait, but we know EC=12, and BE=15. If E is the center, then BE=15 is the radius, so the radius is 15. Then, point C is inside the circle, since EC=12 < 15. 

So, the circle has radius 15, centered at E. Point C is inside the circle, at distance 12 from E. Line DC passes through C and is a secant. So, the line DC starts at D, passes through C, and exits the circle at some point G. 

Thus, power of D is DC * DG = 64. 

But we need to find DC. However, we need to relate DC to AD=x. 

If we can find DG in terms of DC. Let's denote DC = y, then DG = y + CG, where CG is the distance from C to G. But since G is on the circle, EG = 15. 

But how to find CG? 

Using the fact that C is inside the circle, and G is a point on the circle on line DC. So, the distance from E to G is 15, and the distance from E to C is 12. 

If we consider triangle ECG, where E is the center, C is inside, G is on the circle. The line EC is 12, and EG is 15. The line CG is the distance from C to G along the line DC. 

So, using the Law of Cosines in triangle ECG: 

EG² = EC² + CG² - 2 * EC * CG * cos(theta), where theta is the angle at C between EC and CG. 

But without knowing theta, this is not helpful. 

Alternatively, since G is on the circle, and C is a point inside, the vector from E to G is a radius. 

But this seems too abstract. 

Alternatively, since DC passes through C and G, and E is the center, perhaps we can use coordinates. 

Let me set up coordinate system. Let me place E at (0,0). Let me assume that point C is along the x-axis at (12,0), since EC=12. Then, the circle has equation x² + y² = 15² = 225. 

Point D is somewhere outside the circle, and line DC passes through C (12,0) and extends to G on the circle. 

Let me denote D as some point, and line DC passes through C and G. Let me parametrize line DC. Let's say that line DC has direction such that it passes through C (12,0) and extends to G on the circle. 

But without knowing the direction, it's hard to find. 

However, we also have line AD, with length x. Point A is connected to B and D. 

Point B is on the circle, so its coordinates satisfy x² + y² = 225. Since BE=15, and E is at (0,0), then B is a point on the circle. 

But without knowing where B is, it's hard to proceed. 

However, there's a line from E to B, and a line from A to B. 

If I assume that A is the intersection of lines AB and AD. 

But without more information, this is too vague. 

Wait, but we also have line AD, which connects A to D, and line DC connects D to C. So, points A, D, and C are connected. If I can find coordinates for A and D, maybe I can relate AD and DC. 

But this requires making assumptions. 

Let me attempt to assign coordinates. 

Let me assume E is at (0,0), circle equation x² + y² = 225. 

Point C is at (12,0), since EC=12. 

Point B is another point on the circle. Let me choose B at (0,15), which is on the circle since 0² + 15² = 225. 

Now, line EB connects E(0,0) to B(0,15), which is vertical line x=0. 

Line AB connects A to B(0,15). Line AD connects A to D. 

Line DC connects D to C(12,0), which is a secant of the circle. 

Also, DF=8, where F is a point such that DF is tangent to the circle. 

Let me assume that D is outside the circle. Let me denote D as (d_x, d_y). 

The line DC passes through C(12,0) and extends to G on the circle. 

The power of D with respect to the circle is DC * DG = DF^2 = 64. 

Let me calculate DC and DG. 

First, the power of D is |DE|² - r², where r=15. 

Wait, power of D is equal to DE² - r², since E is the center. 

So, power of D = DE² - 15². 

But also, power of D = DC * DG. 

But DC * DG = DE² - 15². 

But we also know that DF is a tangent from D to the circle, so DF² = DE² - 15² = 64. 

Thus, DE² - 225 = 64 → DE² = 289 → DE = 17. 

So, the distance from D to E is 17. 

Now, DE = 17, and EC = 12, with C at (12,0). 

Now, we can use this to find coordinates of D. 

Let me assume that D lies along the line extending from E through C. Wait, but DC is a secant, so D is outside the circle, and line DC passes through C and G. 

If I assume that D lies on the line EC extended beyond C. Let me see. 

Line EC is from E(0,0) to C(12,0), which is the x-axis. Extending beyond C, which is at (12,0), the line would continue towards positive x-direction. 

So, if D is on the x-axis beyond C, then its coordinates would be (12 + t, 0) for some t > 0. 

Let me assume D is on the x-axis at (12 + t, 0). Then, the distance from D to E is sqrt((12+t)^2 + 0^2) = 12 + t. 

We found that DE = 17, so 12 + t = 17 → t = 5. Thus, D is at (17, 0). 

Now, DC is the distance from D(17,0) to C(12,0), which is 5 units. 

Then, DG is the distance from D to G, where G is the other intersection of line DC with the circle. Since line DC is along x-axis, from D(17,0) through C(12,0) to G. 

The circle has equation x² + y² = 225. On the x-axis, the points on the circle are at x=±15, y=0. 

So, line DC is the x-axis. Starting at D(17,0), going left through C(12,0), and the other intersection with the circle is at x=15, y=0. 

Thus, the second intersection point G is at (15, 0). 

Thus, DG is the distance from D(17,0) to G(15,0), which is 2 units. 

So, DC = 5, DG = 2. Check DC * DG = 5 * 2 = 10, but we expected it to be 64. Wait, this contradicts our earlier calculation. What went wrong? 

Earlier, we had DE = 17, which gave power of D as 64, but in this scenario, DC * DG = 5 * 2 = 10 ≠ 64. So, this is inconsistent. 

Where is the mistake? 

Ah, because in this scenario, the power of D should be equal to DC * DG = 64. But in this case, it's 10. This suggests that my assumption about D being on the x-axis is wrong. 

Wait, why did I assume DE = 17? Because I used DF^2 = DE^2 - r^2 = 64. So, DE^2 = 289 → DE = 17. 

But in this scenario, DE is 17, but DC * DG = 10, which should equal 64. This discrepancy shows that D is not on the x-axis. 

So, my assumption that D is on the x-axis was incorrect. 

Thus, I need to find D such that DE = 17, and DC * DG = 64. 

Let me re-examine. 

Let me denote that D is a point such that DE = 17, and the line DC passes through C(12,0) and intersects the circle at G. 

Then, DC * DG = 64. 

But how to find DC and DG? 

Let me recall that for a point D outside the circle, if a secant passes through D, intersecting the circle at C and G, then DC * DG = power of D = DE^2 - r^2 = 64. 

But DE is 17, r is 15, so power is 17² - 15² = 289 - 225 = 64. Correct. 

Thus, DC * DG = 64. 

But how to find DC? 

We need to relate DC to other elements. 

But how? 

If we can express DG in terms of DC and other known quantities. 

Note that DG = DC + CG if G is on the extension of DC beyond C. 

But CG is the distance from C to G along the line DC. 

Since G is on the circle, and C is inside the circle, CG is the length from C to G. 

Let me consider the line DC. Let me parameterize it. Let me assume that the line DC has direction vector v, and point C is at (12,0). Let me denote D as a point such that DE=17, and line DC passes through C. 

Let me use vectors. Let me denote vector EC = C - E = (12,0) - (0,0) = (12,0). 

Vector ED = D - E = (dx, dy), with |ED| = 17. 

Line DC passes through C and D. So, the line DC can be expressed as D + t(C - D), where t varies. 

But this might not help directly. 

Alternatively, since C is on the line DC, and G is another intersection point of line DC with the circle. 

The power of D is DC * DG = 64. 

But DC is the distance from D to C, and DG is the distance from D to G. 

But G is on the line DC, and on the circle. 

Let me denote that the distance from D to G is DG, and the distance from D to C is DC. 

If I let DC = m, then DG = m + CG, assuming G is on the extension beyond C. 

But CG is the distance from C to G along the line DC. 

Since G is on the circle, and C is inside the circle, the length CG can be computed using the power of point C with respect to the circle. 

Wait, but C is inside the circle, so the power of C is negative, and for any line through C intersecting the circle at two points, say C1 and C2, we have CC1 * CC2 = -(power of C). 

But in this case, the line DC passes through C and G. So, CG is the distance from C to G, and if the other intersection point is, say, H, then CH * CG = - (power of C). 

But since C is inside the circle, the power of C is CE² - r²? No, the power of a point inside the circle is negative, and equals -(r² - OC²), where OC is the distance from center to C. 

Wait, the power of point C with respect to the circle is OC² - r², but since C is inside, this is negative. 

Wait, no: the power of a point P with respect to a circle with center O and radius r is OP² - r². If P is inside, this is negative. 

So, for point C, power is OC² - r² = 12² - 15² = 144 - 225 = -81. 

Thus, for any line through C intersecting the circle at two points, say X and Y, then CX * CY = 81 (absolute value). 

In our case, the line DC passes through C and intersects the circle at G (and possibly another point). But since DC is a secant, it must pass through two points. One of them is G, and the other is C itself? No, C is inside the circle, so the line DC passes through C and exits the circle at G. Wait, no—since C is inside, the line DC enters the circle at one point and exits at another. But since C is inside, the line passes through C and intersects the circle at two points. Let's call them G and H. 

Thus, for point C, the power is CG * CH = 81. 

But in our case, the line DC passes through C and G, so one of the intersection points is G, and the other is another point. Wait, but if D is outside, then the line DC passes through D, goes through C, and then exits the circle at G. So, the two intersection points are G and another point. Wait, no—since D is outside, the line DC starts at D, passes through C (inside), and then exits the circle at G. So, the two intersection points are G and another point? Or is there only one intersection? No, a secant line should intersect at two points. So, the line DC passes through D (outside), then enters the circle at one point, passes through C (inside), and exits at another point. Wait, but how can it enter at one point and exit at another? 

Actually, the line DC starts at D (outside), passes through C (inside), and then exits the circle at another point. So, the two intersection points are G and another point, say H. But since C is between D and G, then the two points are H and G, with C lying between D and G. 

Thus, for point C, the power is CH * CG = 81. 

But how does this help us? 

Let me denote that from D, the secant passes through C and G, so DC = distance from D to C, and DG = distance from D to G. 

But since C is between D and G, then DG = DC + CG. 

So, DC * DG = DC * (DC + CG) = 64. 

But from point C's perspective, CG * CH = 81. Here, CH is the distance from C to H, where H is the other intersection point. 

But unless we know where H is, it's hard to relate. 

However, if we assume that the line DC is such that it passes through C and G, and also passes through another point H, then we have two equations:

1. DC * DG = 64
2. CG * CH = 81

But without more info, it's still challenging. 

However, if we assume that the line DC is such that it passes through C and G, and also passes through another point, say H, then we might need more relations. 

This seems too complex. Perhaps there's a simpler way. 

Recall that we have line AD with length x, and DF=8. 

If we can find AD in terms of DC, or relate them. 

Let me think about the coordinates again. 

We know DE = 17, and E is at (0,0). Let me assume that D is at some point (a,b) such that a² + b² = 17² = 289. 

Line DC passes through C(12,0) and D(a,b). 

Parametric equations for line DC: starting at D(a,b) and passing through C(12,0). 

The parametric form can be written as:

x = a + t(12 - a)

y = b + t(0 - b) = b(1 - t)

This line intersects the circle x² + y² = 225 at points D and G. Wait, but D is outside the circle, so the line DC intersects the circle at G and another point. 

Wait, but D is outside, and the line passes through C (inside), so it should intersect the circle at two points: one on the way from D to C, and another on the way from C to the opposite side. 

Wait, but since C is inside, the line DC passes through C and exits the circle at one point. Wait, no—when you draw a line from an external point D through an internal point C, it should enter the circle at one point, pass through C, and exit at another. But since C is inside, it enters at one point, passes through C, and exits at another. So, the two intersection points are, say, P and Q, with C between P and Q. 

But in this case, the line DC passes through D, enters the circle at P, passes through C, and exits at Q. So, DP * DQ = power of D = 64. 

But DP is the distance from D to P, and DQ is the distance from D to Q. 

But since C is between P and Q, then DP = DC + CP, and DQ = DC - CQ, depending on the direction. 

This is getting too abstract. 

Let me try to use the power of point D: DP * DQ = 64. 

But without knowing where P and Q are, it's hard to proceed. 

However, if I can find the length of DC, which is the distance from D to C, and relate it to DP and DQ. 

But without more information, this seems impossible. 

Wait, but we also have the line AD, with length x. If I can express AD in terms of DC and other known quantities. 

Assume that A is a point such that Line(A, D) exists, and Line(B, A) exists. 

But without knowing where A is, it's hard to relate. 

However, there's a line from E to B, and Line(E, B) is given. 

Point B is on the circle, at distance 15 from E. 

Let me assume B is at (0,15), as before. 

Then, line AB connects A to B(0,15). Line AD connects A to D. 

If I can find coordinates for A, but this requires more information. 

This seems too open-ended. 

Perhaps I need to consider that the answer is among the options given, and try to estimate. 

The options are A.7.2, B.8, C.12, D.15. 

Given that DF=8, and the power of D is 64, which is 8^2, it's likely that the answer involves 8. 

But how? 

If DC * DG = 64, and if DC = x, then if DG is some value. 

But without knowing DG, it's hard. 

Wait, if D is such that DC is 8, then DG would be 8, giving 8*8=64. But this would mean DC=8, so x=AD? No, x is AD, not DC. 

Unless AD is DC. 

But how? 

If A, D, and C are collinear, then AD + DC = AC. But without knowing AC, it's hard. 

Alternatively, if AD is part of the secant. 

Wait, if A is the external point, and AD is a secant. 

But we don't have info about other intersections. 

Alternatively, if AD is the tangent, then AD^2 = power of A. But we don't know about A's position. 

This is too many variables. 

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, perhaps I should look for another approach. 

Let me revisit the initial contradiction. If BE=15 and EC=12, and both B and C are on the circle centered at E, this is impossible. Therefore, the problem must have a different configuration. 

Maybe the circle is not centered at E, but E is a point on the circle. Let me try this.
