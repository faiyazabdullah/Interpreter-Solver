Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, the question is asking for the measure of angle 1, which I assume is ∠ADC or something similar based on the points mentioned. Let me start by parsing the given predicates.

First, there are two angle measures given: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B, A, D)), 52) and Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A, B, D)), 27). Wait, angles are typically denoted with three points, where the middle point is the vertex. So Angle(B, A, D) would be the angle at point A between points B and D. Similarly, Angle(A, B, D) is the angle at point B between points A and D. 

So, let me visualize this. Points A, B, C, D are involved. Also, Point D lies on line BC. That's important because it tells us that D is somewhere along the line connecting B and C. 

Let me sketch this mentally. Points B and C form a line, and D is a point on that line. Then we have points A connected to these points. So maybe triangle ABC with D on BC? Or perhaps another configuration. 

Given the angles: At point A, between B and D, the angle is 52 degrees. And at point B, between A and D, the angle is 27 degrees. So, if I imagine triangle ABD, but since D is on BC, maybe triangle ABD is part of a larger figure. 

Wait, let me think again. The first angle is ∠BAD = 52°, because Angle(B, A, D) means vertex at A, so BA to DA. The second angle is ∠ABD = 27°, since Angle(A, B, D) has vertex at B, AB to DB. 

So, in triangle ABD, we know two angles: at A is 52°, at B is 27°. Therefore, the third angle at D can be found since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°. 

Calculating that: 180 - 52 - 27 = 101°. So ∠ADB is 101°. But wait, does that help us with the question? The question asks for MeasureOf(Angle(A, D, C)). That would be the angle at D between points A and C. Since D is on BC, then DC is a segment from D to C. So, angle ADC is formed at D between A and C. 

But how do we find that? Well, if D is on BC, then BD + DC = BC. However, without knowing lengths, maybe we need to use other properties. Alternatively, maybe considering triangle ADC. But we need more information about angles or sides. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a straight line at D. Since D is on BC, then BD is part of BC. So, if we consider angle ADC, which is adjacent to angle ADB. Wait, if we look at point D, with BD and DC forming a straight line. So, angle ADB is 101°, and angle ADC would be supplementary to that if they form a linear pair. Wait, but is that true?

Wait, if D is on BC, then BD and DC are colinear, making a straight line. So, the angle between AD and BD is 101°, and the angle between AD and DC would be 180° - 101° = 79°, assuming that those two angles at D add up to a straight line. Because angle ADB is between AD and BD, and angle ADC is between AD and DC. Since BD and DC are opposite directions along BC, the sum of angles ADB and ADC should be 180°. 

Therefore, if ∠ADB is 101°, then ∠ADC would be 180 - 101 = 79°. Which is one of the options, D. 

But let me check again. Is angle ADC indeed supplementary to angle ADB? Yes, because D lies on BC, so BD and DC are in a straight line. So, when you have AD intersecting BC at D, the angles on either side of AD at D should add up to 180°. Thus, ∠ADB + ∠ADC = 180°. 

Therefore, ∠ADC = 180° - 101° = 79°, so the answer should be D. 

Let me verify once more. Given that in triangle ABD, angles at A and B are 52° and 27°, leading to angle at D being 101°, then angle ADC is 180 - 101 = 79°. So the answer is D. 

Looking at the answer choices, D is 79, so the correct answer is D.
