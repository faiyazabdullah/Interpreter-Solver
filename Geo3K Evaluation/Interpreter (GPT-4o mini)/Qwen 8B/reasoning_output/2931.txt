MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a parallelogram, and some angle measures given in terms of variables b and w. We need to find the value of w from the answer choices. Let me start by recalling some properties of parallelograms because that's crucial here.

First, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel, and opposite angles are equal. Also, consecutive angles are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. Additionally, the diagonals bisect each other. But I'm not sure yet if diagonals are involved here. Let me look at the given angle measures.

The problem gives four angle measures:

1. Measure of Angle(F, A, G) = 2b + 5
2. Measure of Angle(G, A, H) = 2w + 3
3. Measure of Angle(J, F, G) = 4w - 7
4. Measure of Angle(J, H, G) = 3b + 1

Wait, but how do these points relate? Since it's a parallelogram, maybe the points form the vertices? Let me try to visualize. Parallelogram typically has four vertices. Maybe F, A, G, H, J are points connected in some way. Wait, there are five points mentioned here: F, A, G, H, J. That might mean that J is another point, perhaps where diagonals meet? Or maybe part of the structure?

Alternatively, maybe the figure is more complex. Let me think again. In a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. So if two angles are adjacent, their sum should be 180 degrees. However, the given angles may involve different parts of the parallelogram. Let me try to sketch mentally.

Assuming that the parallelogram is named something like FGHA or similar. Wait, the angles mentioned are at different points. For example, Angle(F, A, G) – so vertex at A, with segments AF and AG. Similarly, Angle(G, A, H) would be vertex at A, with GA and AH. Wait, if that's the case, then points F, A, G, H could be arranged such that A is one vertex of the parallelogram, and F and G are adjacent vertices? Or maybe F and G are two vertices, and A is another?

This is getting confusing. Let me try to assign labels properly. Let's suppose that the parallelogram is FGHA, making it a four-sided figure. Then, the vertices would be F, G, H, A. Wait, but then J is also mentioned. Hmm, maybe J is another point? Like, perhaps the intersection of diagonals? In a parallelogram, the diagonals intersect at the midpoint. So if J is the intersection point of diagonals FH and AG, then J would be inside the parallelogram. 

So, considering that, maybe the angles mentioned involve points outside the main parallelogram? Let me check the angles again:

Angle(F, A, G): This is the angle at point A formed by points F, A, G. So if A is a vertex of the parallelogram, then F and G would be adjacent vertices? Wait, if the parallelogram is F, G, H, A, then moving around, the order would be F-G-H-A-F. So, at point A, the adjacent vertices would be H and F. Therefore, angle at A would be between HA and AF. Wait, but the given angle is between F, A, G. Wait, unless G is another vertex? Maybe my assumption about the shape is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the parallelogram is F, A, G, H? Let me consider that. Suppose the parallelogram is FAHG. Then the vertices are F, A, H, G. Then, the sides would be FA, AH, HG, GF. So, the angles at each vertex. Let's see:

At vertex A, the sides would be FA and AH. So the angle at A would be between FA and AH. But the first given angle is angle F, A, G, which would be between FA and AG. Wait, but AG isn't necessarily a side. Unless G is another point. Maybe J is another point? This is getting too vague without a diagram.

Alternatively, since there are angles involving J, maybe J is a diagonal intersection point. Let me think again. If J is the intersection of diagonals FH and AG, then in a parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other. So J would be the midpoint of both diagonals. 

Let me try to assign coordinates to make it easier. Let me place point A at the origin (0,0). Suppose the parallelogram is AFHG. Then, vectors would be helpful. But maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, focus on angles.

Given that the problem mentions a parallelogram, so opposite angles are equal. Also, consecutive angles are supplementary. Let me note that.

But the given angles are not directly opposite angles. Let me list all the angles mentioned:

1. ∠FAG = 2b +5
2. ∠GAH = 2w +3
3. ∠JFG = 4w -7
4. ∠JHG = 3b +1

Wait, maybe these angles are related through the diagonals. If J is the intersection of diagonals, then ∠JFG and ∠JHG might be angles formed by the diagonals with the sides.

Alternatively, perhaps these angles are vertical angles or something else. Let me think again about the structure.

Another approach: Since it's a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So if I can find expressions for two opposite angles, set them equal, and solve for variables. But I need to figure out which angles correspond.

Looking at the given angles:

∠FAG and ∠GAH are both at point A. Wait, if those are adjacent angles at point A, then their sum would be the total angle at A, which in a parallelogram is one of the angles of the parallelogram. Wait, but in a parallelogram, each angle is either acute or obtuse, and adjacent angles are supplementary. So if ∠FAG and ∠GAH are adjacent angles at point A, then their sum should be 180 degrees. Wait, but ∠FAG is one angle and ∠GAH is another. So adding them would give the total angle at A. Which would be one of the angles of the parallelogram. But wait, in a parallelogram, each angle is determined by its position. So if A is a vertex, then the two adjacent angles at A would be supplementary. 

Wait, but if ∠FAG and ∠GAH are adjacent angles at A, then together they form the angle at A. So their sum would be equal to the measure of angle A of the parallelogram. However, depending on how the points are arranged, maybe those angles are not adjacent. Alternatively, maybe ∠FAG and ∠GAH are angles formed by a transversal or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps ∠FAG and ∠GAH are angles formed by the diagonals. For instance, if J is the intersection point of the diagonals, then maybe ∠FAG is part of a triangle involving J. 

This is quite challenging without a diagram. Let me try another approach. Since there are two variables, b and w, and the question asks for w, I need to find equations relating b and w. There are four angle expressions, so maybe combining them via the properties of the parallelogram.

Suppose that ∠FAG and ∠GAH are adjacent angles at point A. Then their sum would be the measure of angle A. But in a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. So:

(2b +5) + (2w +3) = 180° ?

Wait, but that would imply that the sum of these two angles equals 180°, which is true for consecutive angles in a parallelogram. So that's one equation:

2b +5 + 2w +3 = 180  
Simplify: 2b + 2w +8 = 180  
Which simplifies to 2b + 2w = 172 → b + w = 86.  

But that seems very large. Let me check if this assumption is correct. Are ∠FAG and ∠GAH adjacent angles at A? It depends on the configuration. If points F, A, G, H are arranged such that FA and AH are adjacent sides, then yes, but if G is not adjacent, then no. 

Alternatively, maybe ∠FAG and ∠GAH are angles formed by the diagonals. For example, if J is the intersection of diagonals, then maybe ∠FAG is part of triangle AJG or something. 

Alternatively, looking at the other angles given: ∠JFG = 4w -7 and ∠JHG = 3b +1. These angles might be related to the diagonals. Since J is likely the intersection of diagonals, then in a parallelogram, diagonals divide each other into halves. 

In that case, ∠JFG and ∠JHG could be angles formed by the diagonals and the sides. For instance, if FG is a side of the parallelogram, then ∠JFG would be an angle at point F between J and G. Similarly, ∠JHG would be at point H between J and G. But I need to ensure that these angles are related to the properties of the parallelogram.

Another idea: In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, creating vertical angles. So, for example, the angles formed at J by the diagonals would be vertical angles. So ∠JFG and ∠JHG might be vertical angles if they are across from each other. But vertical angles are equal. So if ∠JFG and ∠JHG are vertical angles, then:

4w -7 = 3b +1  
So 4w -7 = 3b +1 → 4w -3b = 8.  

Now, if I have two equations:

From earlier, assuming that the sum of ∠FAG and ∠GAH is 180°, leading to:

Equation 1: 2b + 2w = 172 → b + w = 86  
Equation 2: 4w -3b = 8  

Then solving these two equations:

From Equation 1: b = 86 - w  
Substitute into Equation 2:  
4w -3*(86 -w) = 8  
4w -258 +3w = 8  
7w = 8 +258 = 266  
w = 266 /7 = 38.  

But 38 is not among the answer choices (which are 3,4,5,13), so this suggests that my initial assumption is incorrect. Hence, my previous assumption about the angles being supplementary is wrong. 

Therefore, I need to reconsider the setup. Perhaps ∠FAG and ∠GAH are not adjacent angles at A. Maybe they are angles formed by a diagonal. Let me think again.

If J is the intersection point of the diagonals, then maybe ∠FAG is part of triangle AJG. Let me think about the entire structure. Let me try to imagine the parallelogram with points F, A, G, H. Suppose it's a parallelogram FGHA, so sides FG and HA are parallel, GH and FA are parallel. Diagonals FH and AG intersect at J. Then, the angles mentioned could be:

- ∠FAG: at point A, between F and G. But AG is a diagonal, so this angle would be between side AF and diagonal AG. Similarly, ∠GAH would be between diagonal AG and side AH. 

In this scenario, ∠FAG and ∠GAH are adjacent angles at point A, formed by the diagonal AG splitting the angle at A into two parts. Therefore, their sum would be the measure of angle A of the parallelogram. Since in a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary, angle A plus angle H equals 180°, but angle A itself is split into two parts by the diagonal. 

However, if that's the case, then ∠FAG + ∠GAH = measure of angle A. And since angle A is one of the angles of the parallelogram, which could be either acute or obtuse. But without knowing whether it's acute or obtuse, we can't directly say it's supplementary to another angle. Wait, but if we assume that angle A is split into two parts by the diagonal AG, then ∠FAG + ∠GAH = angle A. 

But then, how does that relate to other angles? Also, the other given angles are ∠JFG and ∠JHG. Let's think about those. Point J is the intersection of diagonals FH and AG. So, ∠JFG is the angle at point F between J and G. Similarly, ∠JHG is the angle at point H between J and G. 

These angles might be related to the triangles formed by the diagonals. For example, in triangle JFG, angle at F is ∠JFG, and similarly for triangle JHG. 

Alternatively, since diagonals in a parallelogram bisect each other, so J is the midpoint of both diagonals. Thus, triangles formed by the diagonals are congruent. 

Maybe the angles ∠JFG and ∠JHG are equal? Because of symmetry. If that's the case, then setting 4w -7 = 3b +1. Which was my previous equation. 

But earlier, that led to an inconsistency. So perhaps there's another relationship. Let me try to find another equation.

Since the diagonals bisect each other, triangle AJG is congruent to triangle HJG? Not sure. Alternatively, since diagonals divide the parallelogram into triangles, maybe the angles at J are related. 

Alternatively, consider triangle FJG and triangle HJG. Wait, maybe not. 

Alternatively, consider that in a parallelogram, the diagonals divide it into two congruent triangles. So, triangles FGH and FGA? Not sure. 

Alternatively, think about the fact that in a parallelogram, the diagonals create vertical angles. So, the angles at point J would have vertical angles. For example, ∠AJF and ∠HJK (assuming K is another point), but not sure. 

Wait, focusing back on the angles given: ∠JFG and ∠JHG. If J is the intersection of diagonals FH and AG, then ∠JFG is an angle at F between J and G. Similarly, ∠JHG is at H between J and G. 

In a parallelogram, sides FG and HA are parallel, and sides GH and FA are parallel. So, if we draw diagonal AG and FH intersecting at J, then triangle FJA is congruent to triangle HJG? Not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe using the property that the diagonals divide each other proportionally. But I'm stuck here. 

Let me think differently. Since there are two variables, b and w, and four angle expressions, perhaps we need to find two equations to solve for them. 

Earlier, I had the equation from ∠JFG = ∠JHG, giving 4w -7 = 3b +1 → 4w -3b = 8. 

If I can find another equation involving b and w, then I can solve for w. 

What other relationships can I derive?

Perhaps considering the angles around point J. Since J is the intersection of diagonals, the sum of angles around J is 360 degrees. However, without knowing specific angles, this might not help directly. 

Alternatively, consider triangle AJG. In this triangle, we know ∠JAG is ∠FAG = 2b +5, and maybe other angles can be expressed. 

Wait, if J is the intersection of diagonals, then AJ is half of diagonal AG, and JG is half of diagonal FH? No, diagonals bisect each other, so AJ = JG if AG is a diagonal. Wait, if AG is a diagonal, then J divides AG into two equal parts. So AJ = JG. Similarly, J is the midpoint of FH. 

So, in triangle AJG, AJ = JG. Therefore, it's an isosceles triangle. Hence, base angles are equal. So, the angles at A and G are equal? Wait, no. In triangle AJG, the two equal sides are AJ and JG, so the base angles would be at A and G. Wait, no, the equal sides are AJ and JG, so the angles opposite them would be equal. The side AJ is opposite angle at G, and JG is opposite angle at A. Therefore, angle at G (∠JGA) equals angle at A (∠JAG). 

But ∠JAG is part of ∠FAG, which is given as 2b +5. Wait, ∠JAG would be the same as ∠FAG? No, because ∠FAG is the angle at A between F and G, while ∠JAG is the angle at A between J and G. Wait, if J is on diagonal AG, then ∠JAG is just a segment along AG. So, ∠JAG would be zero? No, that doesn't make sense. 

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the points. If AG is a diagonal from A to G, and J is the midpoint of AG, then the angle ∠JAG is the same as ∠FAG? No, because J is a point along AG, so the direction from A to G passes through J. So, ∠FAG is the angle between AF and AG. Whereas ∠JAG is the angle between AJ and AG, which is zero because J lies on AG. So that approach might not work. 

Alternative idea: Maybe use the fact that in a parallelogram, the sum of angles around a point is 360 degrees. For example, at point J, where diagonals intersect, the sum of angles around J is 360 degrees. 

But without knowing specific angles, this might not help directly. 

Wait, but maybe consider that ∠JFG and ∠JHG are vertical angles or corresponding angles due to parallel lines. Since FG and HA are parallel (as sides of the parallelogram), and if there's a transversal, maybe that creates equal angles. 

For instance, if we consider FG || HA, and diagonal FH as a transversal. Wait, but FH is a diagonal connecting F and H, which are opposite corners. 

Alternatively, since FG is parallel to HA, and AG is a transversal, then ∠FAG and ∠HGA would be alternate interior angles. Wait, let me think. 

If FG || HA, and AG is a transversal cutting them, then ∠FAG (at A) and ∠AGH (at G) would be alternate interior angles. Therefore, they should be equal. 

Wait, ∠FAG is given as 2b +5, and ∠AGH would be... What is ∠AGH? It's the angle at G between A and H. But in the given predicates, there's an angle ∠JFG = 4w -7. Not sure. 

Alternatively, if ∠FAG = ∠AGH, then:

2b +5 = ∠AGH.

But ∠AGH is part of the parallelogram. Since HA is parallel to FG, and GH is a side. Wait, this is getting too vague. 

Let me take a step back. Given that I have one equation from ∠JFG = ∠JHG (if they are equal), leading to 4w -7 = 3b +1 → 4w -3b = 8. 

I need another equation involving b and w. Let me think about other angle relationships. 

Suppose that the sum of angles in triangle AJG. If I can express some angles in terms of b and w. 

But I don't know enough about the triangle. Alternatively, consider that the sum of angles around point A. At point A, we have angles from the sides and possibly the diagonal. 

If ∠FAG is one angle, and ∠GAH is another, then their sum is the total angle at A. As before, but if that angle is part of the parallelogram, then it's equal to the measure of angle A. In a parallelogram, angle A is equal to angle G, and adjacent angles are supplementary. 

But if I can relate angle A to other angles. 

Wait, if angle A is composed of ∠FAG + ∠GAH = 2b+5 + 2w+3 = 2b + 2w +8. And since in a parallelogram, angle A + angle H = 180°, but angle H would be equal to angle A if it's a rectangle, but in general, it's not. Wait, no, in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So angle A equals angle G, and angle B equals angle H. 

So, if angle A is made up of 2b + 2w +8, then angle G would be equal to it. But also, the other angles, like angle H, would be supplementary to angle A. 

But I still don't see how to connect this to the other given angles. 

Alternatively, consider that the diagonals divide the parallelogram into four triangles. Each triangle has certain angles. For example, triangle AJG has angles at A, J, and G. 

If I can find expressions for those angles. 

But I'm missing information. Let me try to think of another approach. 

Let me list all the given angle expressions again:

1. ∠FAG = 2b +5
2. ∠GAH = 2w +3
3. ∠JFG = 4w -7
4. ∠JHG = 3b +1

Assuming that ∠FAG and ∠GAH are adjacent angles at A, their sum is the measure of angle A, which is equal to the measure of angle G. 

Also, if I consider the other angles, like ∠JFG and ∠JHG, maybe they are related to angles in triangles or other parts. 

Alternatively, since J is the intersection of diagonals, maybe ∠JFG is equal to ∠JHG because of the parallelogram's properties. So 4w -7 = 3b +1, as before. 

With that equation, I need another equation. Let me think about the diagonals creating triangles with certain properties. 

For example, in triangle FJG, we might have some relationships. Let me assume that ∠JFG = 4w -7, and maybe other angles in that triangle can be expressed. 

But without knowing other angles in the triangle, it's hard to proceed. 

Wait, what if I consider the sum of angles in triangle FJG? The sum is 180°, so:

∠JFG + ∠FJG + ∠FGJ = 180°

But I don't know ∠FJG or ∠FGJ. 

Similarly for triangle HJG. 

Alternatively, since diagonals bisect each other, maybe there are congruent triangles. For example, triangles FJG and HJG might be congruent? Not sure. 

Alternatively, since diagonals in a parallelogram bisect each other, the triangles formed are congruent. So, triangle AJG ≅ triangle HJG? Not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the angles ∠JFG and ∠JHG are equal, as previously thought, giving us 4w -7 = 3b +1. 

If I can find another equation, perhaps involving the angles at point A. 

Let me go back to the assumption that ∠FAG + ∠GAH = angle A. And since in a parallelogram, angle A + angle H = 180°, and angle H is equal to angle G. But I don't know how to link this to other angles. 

Wait, but if I can express angle H in terms of other angles. Let me think. 

Angle H is at point H. If I can find an expression for angle H. For example, if there's an angle at H related to ∠JHG. 

∠JHG is given as 3b +1. If this is part of angle H, then maybe ∠JHG is a portion of angle H. 

For example, if at point H, there is an angle formed by sides HG and HA, and the diagonal HJ. So, angle at H is divided into two parts by diagonal HJ. One part is ∠JHG (given as 3b +1), and the other part might be another angle. 

If I can find that other angle, perhaps it relates to another given angle. 

But without knowing the full structure, this is speculative. 

Alternatively, if I assume that angle H is split into two equal parts by the diagonal, then ∠JHG would be half of angle H. But why would it be split equally? Only if the diagonal bisects the angle, which is true in a rhombus, but not necessarily in a general parallelogram. 

Since the problem states it's a parallelogram, not necessarily a rhombus, so diagonals do not necessarily bisect the angles unless it's a rhombus. So this assumption might not hold. 

Hmm. This is really tricky without a diagram. Let me try to think of another angle relationship. 

If I consider that the sum of all angles in the parallelogram is 360°, but each pair of opposite angles are equal. So, 2(angle A) + 2(angle B) = 360°, hence angle A + angle B = 180°. 

But angle A is composed of ∠FAG + ∠GAH = 2b +5 + 2w +3 = 2b + 2w +8. And angle B would be the other angle, which is supplementary to angle A. 

But how does this help? Without knowing angle B, it's unclear. 

Wait, but maybe angle B is related to the other given angles. For example, ∠JFG and ∠JHG. 

Alternatively, let me try to assume that the equations I have are correct, even though they lead to an impossible answer. Earlier, I assumed that ∠FAG + ∠GAH = angle A, and ∠JFG = ∠JHG. 

From that, I got:

Equation 1: 2b + 2w +8 = angle A  
Equation 2: 4w -7 = 3b +1 → 4w -3b = 8  

But without a second equation, I cannot solve for w. So I need another equation. 

Maybe there's another relationship involving the angles at point G. For example, if I consider angle at G. In the parallelogram, angle G is equal to angle A. But also, angle G is composed of other angles. 

Looking at the given angles, there's ∠JFG = 4w -7 and ∠JHG = 3b +1. Maybe these angles are related to angle G. 

Alternatively, if I consider triangle JFG, and triangle JHG. Since diagonals bisect each other, maybe these triangles are congruent, implying that ∠JFG = ∠JHG, which we already used. 

But I still need another equation. 

Wait, maybe the sum of angles around point G. At point G, there are several angles. For example, ∠JGF and ∠JGA, and others. 

Alternatively, let me consider that in the parallelogram, the sum of angles at point G. 

At point G, the angles would include ∠JGF (from diagonal FG) and ∠JGA (from diagonal AG). Wait, but I don't know their measures. 

Alternatively, consider that the diagonals divide the parallelogram into four triangles, and the sum of angles in each triangle. 

But without more information, this seems difficult. 

Wait, perhaps the angles ∠FAG and ∠JHG are related. Let me think. 

If I consider that in triangle FJG, ∠JFG = 4w -7, and in triangle HJG, ∠JHG = 3b +1. If these triangles are congruent, then their corresponding angles are equal. But since the parallelogram is not necessarily a rhombus, this might not hold. 

Alternatively, if I consider that the diagonals create vertical angles. For example, ∠AJF and ∠HJK (but I don't know the labels). 

This is getting too abstract. Maybe I should try plugging in the answer choices and see which one fits. 

The answer choices are A.3, B.4, C.5, D.13. 

Let me test each option. 

Start with option C: w=5. 

From equation 2: 4w -3b =8 → 4*5 -3b =8 → 20 -3b =8 → 3b =12 → b=4. 

Now, check if these values satisfy any other conditions. 

If b=4 and w=5, then:

∠FAG = 2b +5 = 2*4 +5 = 13°  
∠GAH = 2w +3 = 2*5 +3 = 13°  
Sum: 13 +13 =26°, which would be angle A. 

But in a parallelogram, angle A + angle B = 180°, so angle B = 180 -26 = 154°. 

Now, check if the other angles make sense. 

∠JFG = 4w -7 = 4*5 -7 = 20-7=13°  
∠JHG =3b +1 =3*4 +1 =13°. 

So ∠JFG = ∠JHG =13°, which is consistent with them being equal. 

But how does this fit with the rest of the parallelogram? 

If angle A is 26°, then angle G is also 26°. Now, what about the other angles? Let me think about ∠JFG and ∠JHG. 

If ∠JFG =13°, and it's part of triangle FJG, then maybe other angles in that triangle can be found. 

But without knowing more, it's hard to verify. However, this seems plausible. 

Let me check if there's any contradiction. 

Alternatively, let me try option B: w=4. 

Then from equation 2: 4*4 -3b =8 → 16 -3b =8 → 3b=8 → b=8/3 ≈2.666. 

Not integer, and answer choices are integers. So maybe not. 

Option A: w=3. 

4*3 -3b =8 → 12 -3b=8 → 3b=4 → b=4/3. Again non-integer. 

Option D: w=13. 

4*13 -3b =8 → 52 -3b=8 → 3b=44 → b=44/3 ≈14.666. Also non-integer. 

Only option C gives integer values for b and w. So this suggests that w=5 is the correct answer. 

But why? How does this fit with the angle measures? 

If angle A is 26°, and angle B is 154°, then the other angles in the parallelogram are 26° and 154°. 

Now, let me think about the angles ∠JFG and ∠JHG being 13° each. If these angles are parts of the larger angles at points F and H. 

For example, at point F, the angle of the parallelogram is 26°, and if ∠JFG is 13°, then the remaining angle at F would be 26 -13 =13°, which would be another angle. This suggests symmetry, which might be possible in a parallelogram. 

Thus, this seems consistent. 

Therefore, despite earlier confusion about the equations, the only plausible answer that gives integer values is w=5, which is option C. 

So, the Final Answer: C.
