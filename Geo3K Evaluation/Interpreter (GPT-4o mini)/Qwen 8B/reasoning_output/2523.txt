Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have two rectangles, right? The first one is Rectangle(A,B,C,D) and the second is Rectangle(E,F,G,D). Also, there are some length measurements given. The question says the pair of polygons is similar, and we need to find x. The options are A. 2, B. 3, C. 5, D. 6.

First, I need to visualize these rectangles. Let me sketch them mentally. Let's start with the first rectangle ABCD. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. Similarly, EFGD is another rectangle. Wait, both rectangles share the point D? Because the second rectangle is E-F-G-D. So they share point D. Hmm.

Now, the given lengths: LengthOf(Line(A,E)) is 5. That means the distance between points A and E is 5 units. Then, LengthOf(Line(D,G)) is 7.5. So the distance between D and G is 7.5 units. Then, LengthOf(Line(A,B)) is x - 2. Since AB is a side of rectangle ABCD, so AB would be one of its sides. And LengthOf(Line(B,D)) is x. BD is a diagonal of the rectangle ABCD because in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal. Wait, but BD connects B to D. In rectangle ABCD, the vertices are connected as A-B-C-D-A. So BD would be a diagonal connecting B to D. So in rectangle ABCD, BD is a diagonal, and its length is given as x.

But also, since ABCD is a rectangle, the diagonals are equal. So AC and BD should be equal. But maybe that's not directly helpful here yet.

Now, the other rectangle is EFGD. So the vertices are E-F-G-D. So EF, FG, GD, DE are the sides. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So EF equals GD, and FG equals ED. Also, the diagonals EG and FD would be equal. 

Wait, but how do these rectangles relate? They share the point D. Maybe they are adjacent? Or perhaps overlapping? Not sure yet. But since they're similar, their corresponding sides must be proportional. So similarity implies that the ratio of corresponding sides is constant.

So if the two rectangles are similar, then the ratios of their corresponding sides must be equal. Let me think about which sides correspond. Since they are both rectangles, their angles are all 90 degrees, so they are similar if their sides are in proportion.

But to figure out which sides correspond, we need to know how the rectangles are oriented. Let me consider the structure again. Both rectangles share point D. Let me try to imagine or assign coordinates to make this clearer.

Let me assign coordinates to the points. Let me assume coordinate system where D is at the origin (0,0). Let me suppose that rectangle ABCD has coordinates such that D is at (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, let me define the coordinates:

Let’s say point D is (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, moving from D to C to B to A. Wait, maybe I need to think more carefully. Let me recall that in rectangle ABCD, the order of the letters matters. So A-B-C-D-A. So AB is adjacent to BC, CD, DA.

Alternatively, maybe assigning coordinates could help. Let me try that.

Let me take point D as (0,0). Suppose rectangle ABCD has sides AB and AD. Let me denote vectors. Alternatively, perhaps better to use variables for coordinates.

Alternatively, since we have Line(A,E) and Line(D,G), maybe there are connections between these rectangles. For example, point E is part of rectangle EFGD, and point G is connected to D. So maybe EFGD shares the side DG with the other rectangle?

Wait, in rectangle EFGD, the sides are EF, FG, GD, and DE. So GD is one of the sides. Given that LengthOf(Line(D,G)) is 7.5, so GD is 7.5. Therefore, in rectangle EFGD, the length of GD is 7.5, which would be one of the sides. Since it's a rectangle, the opposite side EF should also be 7.5. Then FG and DE would be the other pair of sides.

Similarly, in rectangle ABCD, AB is a side with length x - 2, and BD is a diagonal with length x. So in rectangle ABCD, AB is one side, and BD is the diagonal. So if AB is one side, then AD would be another side, and the diagonal BD can be found via Pythagoras: AB² + AD² = BD². So substituting, (x - 2)^2 + AD^2 = x^2. Which gives AD^2 = x^2 - (x - 2)^2. Expanding that: x² - (x² -4x +4) = 4x -4. So AD = sqrt(4x -4).

But how does this relate to the other rectangle? Since the two rectangles are similar, their corresponding sides must be in proportion. But which sides correspond? To figure that out, we need to know which sides of each rectangle are corresponding.

Since both rectangles are similar, their side ratios must be equal. Let me think about the correspondence. Let's assume that the rectangles are similar in the order ABCD ~ EFGD. But need to confirm the correspondence of sides. However, without knowing the orientation, this might be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps considering that both rectangles share point D, which might be a corner for both.

Another approach: Since the rectangles are similar, their corresponding sides are in proportion. Let's denote the sides of ABCD as AB and AD. Then, the sides of EFGD would be EF and ED (assuming the sides are EF and FG, etc.). Wait, but in rectangle EFGD, the sides are EF, FG, GD, and DE. So GD is one side (length 7.5), and DE is another side. So the sides of EFGD are GD (7.5) and DE (unknown). Similarly, for rectangle ABCD, the sides are AB (x-2) and AD (which we found earlier as sqrt(4x -4)). 

But since they are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides should be equal. Now, we need to figure out which sides correspond. There are different possibilities depending on the orientation. For instance, if the rectangles are similar such that AB corresponds to EF, and AD corresponds to FG, or something like that. But without knowing the exact correspondence, it's challenging. However, since they share point D, perhaps there's a connection between sides involving D.

Wait, in rectangle ABCD, point D is a vertex. In rectangle EFGD, point D is also a vertex. So perhaps in the similarity transformation, the point D maps to itself? Or maybe not necessarily. But if the similarity preserves orientation, then maybe.

Alternatively, maybe the rectangles are positioned such that side GD of EFGD corresponds to side AB of ABCD, or something else. Let me think about the given lengths. We have LengthOf(Line(A,E)) = 5. So AE is 5. Also, LengthOf(Line(D,G)) = 7.5. So DG is 7.5.

Assuming that the rectangles are similar, their sides must be in proportion. Let me consider that in rectangle ABCD, the sides are AB = x - 2 and AD = sqrt(4x -4), while the sides of EFGD are GD = 7.5 and DE (let's call DE = y). Since EFGD is a rectangle, the sides GD and DE are adjacent sides, so their lengths are 7.5 and y. Therefore, the ratio of the sides of EFGD is 7.5 : y.

For similarity between ABCD and EFGD, the ratio of their corresponding sides must be equal. So either AB / GD = AD / DE, or AB / DE = AD / GD, depending on which sides correspond. But we don't know which sides correspond. This seems ambiguous unless we can find more relations.

However, we also have the length AE = 5. How does AE relate to the rectangles? Point A is part of rectangle ABCD, and point E is part of rectangle EFGD. So AE is a line connecting these two rectangles. Perhaps AE is a side or diagonal of one of the rectangles? Or maybe part of a larger figure?

Alternatively, maybe AE and DG are corresponding sides? If AE is a side in one rectangle and DG is a side in the other. But DG is 7.5, and AE is 5. If they are corresponding sides, then the ratio would be 5 / 7.5 = 2/3. Then, the ratio of similarity would be 2/3. Then, the sides of ABCD would be scaled by 2/3 compared to EFGD. But how does that fit?

Alternatively, maybe AE is a diagonal? Let me think. If AE is a diagonal of one of the rectangles. For example, if E is connected to A, perhaps in rectangle EFGD, point E is connected to D. Wait, in rectangle EFGD, the sides are EF, FG, GD, and DE. So DE is a side. So if we connect E to D, that's a side of the rectangle. But AE is a line from A to E. So AE is not necessarily a side or diagonal of either rectangle.

Hmm. This seems complicated. Maybe I need to find another way. Let me think about the diagonals. In rectangle ABCD, the diagonal BD has length x. In rectangle EFGD, the diagonal EG would be equal to the diagonal of the rectangle. Since EFGD is a rectangle, its diagonals are equal. So the diagonal EG would have length sqrt(GD² + DE²) = sqrt(7.5² + y²), where y is DE. 

But how does this relate to the other rectangle? If the rectangles are similar, their diagonals should be in the same ratio as their sides. So the ratio of diagonals would be the same as the ratio of sides. 

Alternatively, since AE is given as 5, maybe AE relates to the diagonals or sides. For instance, if AE is a diagonal of one of the rectangles. Wait, but AE connects A to E. If A is part of ABCD and E is part of EFGD, perhaps there's a connection through point D?

Wait, let me try to think of the entire configuration. Points A, B, C, D form a rectangle. Points E, F, G, D form another rectangle. So both rectangles share point D. Let me imagine that. So D is common to both rectangles. So perhaps the two rectangles meet at D. So, for example, in rectangle ABCD, D is connected to C and A. In rectangle EFGD, D is connected to G and E. So maybe the rectangles are adjacent along the side DG and DC or something? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between the sides of the two rectangles through the shared point D. For instance, if line AE connects A to E, which are vertices of the respective rectangles. 

Let me think about coordinates again. Let me assign coordinates to make equations manageable.

Let me place point D at (0, 0). Let me assume that in rectangle ABCD, since BD is a diagonal with length x. Let me assign coordinates to other points. Let me suppose that point A is (a, b), point B is (c, d), etc., but this might get too abstract. Alternatively, since ABCD is a rectangle, let me assign coordinates such that D is at (0, 0), and let me align the rectangle so that side AD is along the y-axis and AB is along the x-axis.

So let me set up coordinates:

Let’s say point D is at (0, 0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, let me assume that point A is at (0, k) for some k, so AD is vertical. Then, since AB is horizontal, point B would be at (m, k), and point C would be at (m, 0). Wait, but then BC would go from (m, k) to (m, 0), making CD from (m, 0) to (0, 0). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check.

In a rectangle ABCD, consecutive points are connected. So starting at A, going to B, then to C, then to D, then back to A. So if D is at (0, 0), then C would be connected to D. Let me think of a standard rectangle. Let me consider that in rectangle ABCD, if we have coordinates:

Let me fix point D at (0, 0). Let me assume that side AD is vertical, and side DC is horizontal. So point A is (0, a), point D is (0, 0), point C is (c, 0), and point B is (c, a). So that AB is from (0,a) to (c,a), BC is from (c,a) to (c,0), CD is from (c,0) to (0,0), and DA is from (0,0) to (0,a). Wait, but that would make ABCD a rectangle with length AB = c, AD = a, and diagonal BD from B(c,a) to D(0,0), whose length is sqrt(c² + a²). According to the problem, BD has length x. So sqrt(c² + a²) = x. Also, AB is given as x - 2, so AB = c = x - 2. Hence, c = x - 2. Then, the diagonal BD is sqrt((x-2)^2 + a^2) = x. Squaring both sides: (x-2)^2 + a^2 = x^2 → x² -4x +4 +a² = x² → -4x +4 +a²=0 → a² =4x -4. So a = sqrt(4x -4).

Now, looking at rectangle EFGD. It has vertices E, F, G, D. Let me assume that D is still at (0,0). Let me try to define coordinates for EFGD. Since it's a rectangle, and D is one of its vertices. Let me assume that side DG is horizontal or vertical? Well, the length of DG is 7.5. Let me suppose that in rectangle EFGD, DG is a horizontal side. So if D is at (0,0), then G could be at (g, 0), making DG along the x-axis. But wait, in my previous setup, point C was at (c, 0). So maybe G is at (g, 0), but that might overlap with point C if g=c. But not sure.

Alternatively, maybe DG is vertical. Let me think. Let me assume that in rectangle EFGD, DG is vertical. So if D is at (0,0), then G could be at (0, h), making DG vertical with length h =7.5. So G is at (0,7.5). Then, since EFGD is a rectangle, point E would be somewhere. For example, if DG is vertical from D(0,0) to G(0,7.5), then the other side from D would be DE. Let me assume that DE is horizontal. So point E would be at (k, 0), making DE horizontal from D(0,0) to E(k, 0). Then, the rectangle EFGD would have sides DG (vertical) from D(0,0) to G(0,7.5), DE (horizontal) from D(0,0) to E(k,0), then FG would be from F to G, and so on. Wait, but in that case, point F would be at (k,7.5). So the rectangle EFGD has coordinates E(k,0), F(k,7.5), G(0,7.5), D(0,0). 

But then, the length of DG is 7.5, which matches the given. Also, the length of DE is |k|, which would be one side of the rectangle. The other side is DG =7.5. So the sides of rectangle EFGD are DE = k and DG =7.5.

Now, the problem states that the pair of polygons (rectangles) are similar. So rectangle ABCD and rectangle EFGD are similar. So their corresponding sides must be in proportion. 

What are the sides of ABCD? Earlier, we had AB = x-2 (which is the horizontal side) and AD = sqrt(4x-4) (the vertical side). So the sides of ABCD are (x-2) and sqrt(4x-4). 

The sides of EFGD are DE and DG. From above, DE is k and DG is 7.5. So the sides of EFGD are k and 7.5. 

Since the rectangles are similar, their sides must be in proportion. So the ratio of AB to DE should equal the ratio of AD to DG, assuming corresponding sides. Or vice versa, depending on orientation. 

But which sides correspond? Depending on how the rectangles are oriented. Let me assume that AB corresponds to DE and AD corresponds to DG. Or AB corresponds to DG and AD corresponds to DE. 

Case 1: Assume AB corresponds to DE and AD corresponds to DG. Then:

AB / DE = AD / DG

(x - 2)/k = sqrt(4x -4)/7.5

Also, we have another piece of information: LengthOf(Line(A,E)) = 5. What is point E? In our coordinate setup, E is at (k, 0). Point A is at (0, a) where a = sqrt(4x -4). So the distance between A(0,a) and E(k, 0) is sqrt[(k - 0)^2 + (0 - a)^2] = sqrt(k² + a²) = 5. 

Therefore:

sqrt(k² + a²) = 5 → k² + a² = 25.

But we already have a² = 4x -4. So substituting:

k² + (4x -4) = 25 → k² = 25 -4x +4 = 29 -4x.

Now, from the similarity ratio:

(x - 2)/k = sqrt(4x -4)/7.5 → cross-multiplying:

7.5(x - 2) = k * sqrt(4x -4)

But we also have k² = 29 -4x. Let me write down these equations:

Equation 1: k² = 29 -4x

Equation 2: 7.5(x - 2) = k * sqrt(4x -4)

This looks complex, but maybe we can substitute k² from Equation 1 into Equation 2. Let me square both sides of Equation 2 to eliminate the square root.

[7.5(x - 2)]² = k² * (4x -4)

Substituting k² from Equation 1:

[7.5² (x - 2)^2] = (29 -4x)(4x -4)

Calculate left side: 56.25(x² -4x +4)

Right side: expand (29 -4x)(4x -4) 

Multiply term by term:

29*4x = 116x

29*(-4) = -116

(-4x)*4x = -16x²

(-4x)*(-4) = 16x

So altogether:

-16x² + (116x +16x) -116 = -16x² +132x -116

Thus:

Left side: 56.25x² - 225x + 225

Set equal to right side:

56.25x² -225x +225 = -16x² +132x -116

Bring all terms to left side:

56.25x² -225x +225 +16x² -132x +116 = 0

Combine like terms:

(56.25 +16)x² + (-225x -132x) + (225+116) = 0

Which is:

72.25x² -357x +341 = 0

Hmm, solving quadratic equation 72.25x² -357x +341 = 0. Let me convert 72.25 to fraction. 72.25 = 72 + 1/4 = 289/4. Similarly, 357 is 357, and 341 remains as is. Multiply all terms by 4 to eliminate decimal:

289x² - 1428x + 1364 = 0

Now, solving quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0:

Discriminant D = b² -4ac = (1428)^2 -4*289*1364

This seems messy. Maybe I made an error in calculation earlier. Let me check the expansion again.

Original expansion:

Left side after squaring: 56.25(x-2)^2 = 56.25(x² -4x +4) = 56.25x² -225x + 225

Right side after expanding (29 -4x)(4x -4):

First compute 29*(4x -4) = 116x -116

Then compute -4x*(4x -4) = -16x² +16x

Total: -16x² + (116x +16x) -116 = -16x² +132x -116

Yes, that's correct.

So bringing everything to left:

56.25x² -225x +225 +16x² -132x +116 = 0 → 72.25x² -357x +341 = 0.

Yes. So 72.25x² -357x +341 = 0.

Let me see if this quadratic factors or simplifies. Let me note that 72.25 is 289/4, so multiply all terms by 4:

289x² - 1428x + 1364 = 0.

Check discriminant D = (1428)^2 -4*289*1364.

Calculating 1428 squared: 1428*1428. That's a big number. Maybe there's a mistake in earlier steps?

Alternatively, maybe this case is incorrect. Perhaps the assumption about which sides correspond is wrong. Let me check the alternative case.

Case 2: Suppose that AB corresponds to DG and AD corresponds to DE. Then:

AB / DG = AD / DE → (x-2)/7.5 = sqrt(4x -4)/k

And again, we have the distance from A to E being 5. As before, A is at (0,a), E is at (k,0), so sqrt(k² + a²)=5 → k² + a² =25. With a² =4x -4, so k² =29 -4x.

So from similarity ratio:

(x-2)/7.5 = sqrt(4x -4)/k → cross-multiplying:

k(x-2) = 7.5 * sqrt(4x -4)

Again, square both sides:

k²(x-2)^2 = 56.25(4x -4)

Replace k² with 29 -4x:

(29 -4x)(x-2)^2 = 56.25(4x -4)

Expand left side:

First, expand (x-2)^2 = x² -4x +4

Multiply by (29 -4x):

(29 -4x)(x² -4x +4) = ?

Let me compute term by term:

29*x² = 29x²

29*(-4x) = -116x

29*4 = 116

-4x*x² = -4x³

-4x*(-4x) = 16x²

-4x*4 = -16x

So combining all terms:

-4x³ + (29x² +16x²) + (-116x -16x) +116 =

-4x³ +45x² -132x +116

Right side: 56.25(4x -4) = 225x - 225.

So equation becomes:

-4x³ +45x² -132x +116 = 225x -225

Bring all terms to left:

-4x³ +45x² -132x +116 -225x +225 = 0 → -4x³ +45x² -357x +341 = 0 → multiplying by -1: 4x³ -45x² +357x -341 = 0.

This cubic equation seems even worse. Maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check again the Case 2 setup.

Alternatively, maybe I messed up the correspondence of sides. Let me think differently. Since the rectangles are similar, their sides must be in proportion. Let me denote the sides of ABCD as s1 and s2, and the sides of EFGD as t1 and t2. Then s1/s2 = t1/t2. Also, since they are similar, the ratio of the diagonals should be the same as the ratio of sides.

In rectangle ABCD, the diagonal BD is x. In rectangle EFGD, the diagonal EG is sqrt(t1² + t2²). So the ratio of diagonals would be x / sqrt(t1² + t2²) = s1/s2.

But we also have that AE = 5. Where is point E? In our coordinate system, E is at (k,0). So the distance from A(0,a) to E(k,0) is sqrt(k² +a²) =5. And from earlier, a² =4x -4, and k² =29 -4x. Thus, k² +a² =29 -4x +4x -4 =25, which checks out. So that's consistent.

But how does this relate to the similarity ratio?

Let me think again. The two rectangles are similar, so their sides are in proportion. Let me denote the sides of ABCD as AB = x-2 and AD = sqrt(4x-4). The sides of EFGD are DE =k and DG=7.5. So the ratio of sides depends on which sides correspond.

Possibility 1: AB corresponds to DG, AD corresponds to DE. Then:

(x-2)/7.5 = sqrt(4x-4)/k → same as Case 2 earlier.

Or Possibility 2: AB corresponds to DE, AD corresponds to DG. Then:

(x-2)/k = sqrt(4x-4)/7.5 → same as Case 1.

But both cases led to complicated equations. Maybe there's another approach.

We have from AE =5, which gives us k² + a² =25. And we have a² =4x -4. So substituting, k² =25 - (4x -4) = 29 -4x.

Additionally, since the rectangles are similar, the ratio of their sides must be equal. Let me assume that the ratio of AB to AD is equal to the ratio of DE to DG. Because similarity implies that corresponding sides are in proportion. So AB/AD = DE/DG.

AB is x-2, AD is sqrt(4x-4), DE is k, DG is 7.5. So:

(x-2)/sqrt(4x-4) = k /7.5 → rearranged:

k = 7.5*(x-2)/sqrt(4x-4)

But we also have k² =29 -4x.

So substituting k from above into k²:

[7.5*(x-2)/sqrt(4x-4)]² =29 -4x

Compute left side:

7.5² * (x-2)^2 / (4x-4) = (56.25)*(x-2)^2/(4x-4)

Note that 4x-4 =4(x-1), and (x-2)^2 is as is. So:

56.25*(x-2)^2 / [4(x-1)] = 29 -4x

Multiply both sides by 4(x-1):

56.25*(x-2)^2 = 4(x-1)(29 -4x)

Let me calculate both sides.

First, simplify 56.25. Note that 56.25 = 225/4.

So left side: (225/4)*(x-2)^2

Right side: 4(x-1)(29 -4x) =4*( -4x² + (4x + 29x) -29 )? Wait, let me expand (x-1)(29 -4x):

(x-1)(-4x +29) = -4x(x-1) +29(x-1) = -4x² +4x +29x -29 = -4x² +33x -29

So right side: 4*(-4x² +33x -29) = -16x² +132x -116

Now, left side: (225/4)*(x² -4x +4) = (225/4)x² -225x +225

Setting equal:

(225/4)x² -225x +225 = -16x² +132x -116

Multiply all terms by 4 to eliminate denominator:

225x² -900x +900 = -64x² +528x -464

Bring all terms to left:

225x² -900x +900 +64x² -528x +464 = 0 → 289x² -1428x +1364 = 0

Same equation as before! So we end up with the same quadratic equation as in Case 1. Which suggests that regardless of the correspondence, we arrive at the same equation. Which means that the assumption about which sides correspond may not matter, as long as the similarity ratio holds.

So solving 289x² -1428x +1364 = 0.

Let me try to solve this quadratic equation. Using quadratic formula:

x = [1428 ± sqrt(1428² -4*289*1364)] / (2*289)

First calculate discriminant D = 1428² -4*289*1364.

Let me compute 1428². Let me note that 1428 = 1428. Let me approximate or look for patterns. Alternatively, notice that 289 is 17², and 1364 divided by 289? Let me see if 289 divides into 1364. 289*4 = 1156, 1364-1156=208. So not divisible. Maybe factor out common terms?

Alternatively, let me try plugging in the answer choices into the equation to see which satisfies it.

Given options are x=2,3,5,6.

Let me test x=5:

Plug x=5 into 289x² -1428x +1364:

289*(25) -1428*5 +1364 = 7225 -7140 +1364 = 7225 -7140 is 85; 85 +1364=1449 ≠0.

Not zero.

x=6:

289*36 -1428*6 +1364 = let's compute:

289*36: 289*30=8670, 289*6=1734 → total 8670+1734=10404

1428*6=8568

So 10404 -8568 +1364 = 10404 -8568 = 1836 +1364 = 3200 ≠0.

x=3:

289*9 -1428*3 +1364 = 2601 -4284 +1364 = (2601 +1364) -4284 = 3965 -4284 = -319 ≠0.

x=2:

289*4 -1428*2 +1364 = 1156 -2856 +1364 = (1156 +1364) -2856 = 2520 -2856 = -336 ≠0.

None of these give zero. Hmmm... that suggests that none of the answer choices satisfy the equation, which is impossible since the problem must have an answer among the choices. So I must have made a mistake in setting up the equations.

Let me re-examine the assumptions. Perhaps the correspondence of sides is different. Let me think again about the rectangles' sides.

Rectangle ABCD has sides AB and AD, with AB=x-2 and AD=sqrt(4x-4). Rectangle EFGD has sides DG=7.5 and DE=k. But perhaps the sides of EFGD are not DG and DE but rather DG and GF? Wait, in rectangle EFGD, the sides are EF, FG, GD, and DE. So DG is one side (length 7.5), and DE is another side (length k). So yes, the sides are DG and DE. So the ratio of sides for EFGD is 7.5:k.

For similarity, the ratio of sides of ABCD to EFGD should be the same. So if ABCD has sides AB and AD, then the ratio AB/AD should equal DG/DE or AD/AB depending on correspondence.

Wait, maybe the rectangles are similar in the order ABCD ~ EFGD, implying that AB corresponds to EF, BC corresponds to FG, CD corresponds to GD, and DA corresponds to DE. So then AB corresponds to EF, BC corresponds to FG, CD corresponds to GD, DA corresponds to DE. 

If that's the case, then AB corresponds to EF, which is a side of EFGD. But what is EF? In rectangle EFGD, EF is equal to GD, since it's a rectangle. So EF = GD =7.5. Therefore, AB corresponds to EF, which is 7.5. So AB = x-2 corresponds to EF=7.5. Then, DA corresponds to DE. DA is sqrt(4x-4), DE is k. So the ratio of AB/EF = DA/DE.

So (x-2)/7.5 = sqrt(4x-4)/k → same as earlier Case 2. Which leads to the same equation. But when testing the answer choices, none worked. So perhaps there's an error in the setup.

Wait, maybe the correspondence is different. Let me think. If ABCD ~ EFGD, then the order of the vertices matters. For example, AB corresponds to EF, BC corresponds to FG, CD corresponds to GD, DA corresponds to DE. So the sides AB and CD of ABCD correspond to EF and GD of EFGD. Since CD is equal to AB in a rectangle, and GD is 7.5. So CD = AB = x-2. Therefore, GD (which is 7.5) corresponds to CD (which is x-2). So the ratio of similarity would be CD/GD = (x-2)/7.5. Also, DA corresponds to DE, so DA/DE = (sqrt(4x-4))/k. Since similarity requires all ratios to be equal, so (x-2)/7.5 = sqrt(4x-4)/k. Same as before. And also, from the distance AE=5, we have k² + a² =25, with a²=4x-4, leading to k²=29-4x. Substituting into the ratio equation.

So this brings us back to the same equation. Which suggests that perhaps I made a miscalculation in solving the equation. Let me try plugging x=5 into the original equation.

Original equation after substitution was:

(225/4)*(x-2)^2 / (4x-4) =29 -4x

Let me plug x=5:

Left side: (225/4)*(3)^2 / (16) = (225/4)*(9)/16 = 2025/64 ≈31.64

Right side: 29 -20 =9. Not equal. So not matching.

x=6: Left side: (225/4)*(4)^2 / (20) = (225/4)*16/20 = (225*4)/20 = 900/20 =45. Right side: 29 -24=5. Not equal.

x=3: Left side: (225/4)*(1)^2 / (8) = 225/32 ≈7.03. Right side: 29 -12=17. No.

x=2: Left side: (225/4)*(0)^2 / ... = 0. Right side: 29 -8=21. No.

None work. So this suggests that there's an error in the setup. Let me reconsider the initial assumptions.

Maybe the correspondence of the sides is different. Perhaps the rectangles are similar in a different order. Like ABCD ~ DGF E or something. Or maybe the sides AB corresponds to DE, and AD corresponds to DG. Let me try that.

So AB corresponds to DE, and AD corresponds to DG. Then AB/DE = AD/DG → (x-2)/k = sqrt(4x-4)/7.5. Which is the same as Case 1. And we have k² +a²=25, with a²=4x-4, so k²=29-4x.

From this ratio: (x-2)/k = sqrt(4x-4)/7.5 → k =7.5*(x-2)/sqrt(4x-4)

Square both sides: k² = 56.25*(x-2)^2 / (4x-4)

But k² =29 -4x, so:

29 -4x = 56.25*(x-2)^2 / (4x-4)

Multiply both sides by (4x-4):

(29 -4x)(4x-4) = 56.25(x-2)^2

Expand left side: 29*4x -29*4 -4x*4x +4x*4 = 116x -116 -16x² +16x = -16x² +132x -116

Right side: 56.25(x² -4x +4) =56.25x² -225x +225

So equation: -16x² +132x -116 =56.25x² -225x +225

Move all terms to left:

-16x² +132x -116 -56.25x² +225x -225 = 0 → -72.25x² +357x -341 = 0 → multiply by -1: 72.25x² -357x +341 =0, which is the same as before.

Same equation. So no progress.

Perhaps there's an error in the assumption about the correspondence of sides? Maybe the rectangles are similar but in a different orientation, like rotated? Or maybe the similarity involves flipping?

Alternatively, maybe the side AE is not directly related to the sides of the rectangles, but is part of a triangle or something else?

Wait, let me revisit the given data. The problem says the pair of polygons is similar. So both are rectangles, hence similar if their sides are in proportion. But maybe I missed a key relation?

Wait, what if the rectangles are similar, so the ratio of their sides is the same. Let me denote the sides of ABCD as AB = x-2 and AD = sqrt(4x-4). The sides of EFGD are DG =7.5 and DE =k. So the ratio of sides of ABCD is (x-2):sqrt(4x-4), and for EFGD it's 7.5:k. These ratios must be equal. So:

(x-2)/sqrt(4x-4) = 7.5/k → k = 7.5*sqrt(4x-4)/(x-2)

But also, from the distance AE=5, we have k² + (4x-4) =25 → k² =25 -4x +4 =29 -4x.

Substitute k from above into this:

[7.5*sqrt(4x-4)/(x-2)]² =29 -4x

→ 56.25*(4x-4)/(x-2)^2 =29 -4x

Let me rewrite this:

56.25*(4x-4) = (29 -4x)(x-2)^2

Factor 4x-4 =4(x-1), so:

56.25*4(x-1) = (29 -4x)(x-2)^2

Calculate left side: 225(x-1)

Right side: (29 -4x)(x-2)^2

Expand right side: Let's expand (x-2)^2 =x² -4x +4, then multiply by (29 -4x):

(29 -4x)(x² -4x +4) = 29x² -116x +116 -4x³ +16x² -16x = -4x³ +45x² -132x +116

So equation is:

225(x-1) = -4x³ +45x² -132x +116

Expand left side: 225x -225

Bring all terms to left:

225x -225 +4x³ -45x² +132x -116 =0 → 4x³ -45x² +357x -341 =0

Same cubic equation as before. Still no solution in the options.

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I made a wrong assumption about the correspondence of the sides. Let me think differently: perhaps the rectangles are not aligned with the axes, and the similarity includes rotation? But similarity allows for rotation, so the correspondence could be different.

Alternatively, maybe the AE is not a diagonal but a side? Wait, AE is from A to E. If A is part of ABCD and E is part of EFGD, perhaps AE is a side of one of the rectangles? Or maybe part of a triangle?

Wait, let me think about the coordinates again. If I assumed that in rectangle EFGD, point E is at (k,0) and point D is at (0,0), then AE is from A(0, a) to E(k, 0). This forms a right triangle with legs k and a, hypotenuse 5. So k² + a² =25. And a² =4x-4, so k² =25 -4x +4 =29 -4x.

Now, if the rectangles are similar, then the ratio of their sides must be equal. Let me assume that the ratio of AB to AD is equal to the ratio of DE to DG. So (x-2)/sqrt(4x-4) = k/7.5. Which gives k = 7.5*(x-2)/sqrt(4x-4). And k² =29-4x. So:

[7.5^2 (x-2)^2]/(4x-4) =29-4x

Which is the same equation as before. Let me try to solve it numerically. Let me denote f(x) = 72.25x²
