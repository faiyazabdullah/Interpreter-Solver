<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we need to find the value of x given some conditions involving points, lines, circles, and angles. Let me start by breaking down the given information step by step.

First, the problem mentions several points: A, B, C, D, E, F. There are lines AB and DF. Also, there's a circle O, and two radii: OC and OE. That means points C and E are on the circle centered at O. Then there are right angles at Angle(C,B,A) and Angle(E,F,D). Also, the measure of arc AD is given as 2x + 14, and the length of segment CE is 9x. The main question is that AB is congruent to DF, so AB ≅ DF. We need to find x.

Let me list out all the given predicates again to make sure I don't miss anything:

- Circle(O): So O is the center of a circle.
- Points A, B, C, D, E, F.
- Lines AB and DF.
- IsRadiusOf(Line(O,C), Circle(O)): So OC is a radius of the circle. Therefore, point C lies on the circle centered at O.
- Similarly, IsRadiusOf(Line(O,E), Circle(O)): So OE is also a radius, meaning E is another point on the same circle.
- RightAngle(Angle(C,B,A)): This tells us that angle at point B, formed by points C, B, A is a right angle. So triangle CBA is a right triangle with right angle at B.
- RightAngle(Angle(E,F,D)): Similarly, angle at F, formed by points E, F, D is a right angle. So triangle EFD is a right triangle with right angle at F.
- Equals(MeasureOf(Arc(A,D)), 2x + 14): The measure of arc AD on the circle is 2x + 14 degrees? Wait, but arcs are measured in degrees, but maybe here it's just a variable expression. But since they mention MeasureOf, perhaps it's in terms of radians or degrees, but since we're dealing with variables, it's probably just an algebraic expression.
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,E)), 9x): The length of segment CE is 9x units. Since C and E are both points on the circle centered at O, the distance between them would be the length of the chord CE. 

Now, the main thing to find is x, given that AB ≅ DF. So AB equals DF in length. Let me think about how these elements connect.

Since AB and DF are lines, but the problem states that they are congruent. Wait, actually, the problem says "A B ≅ D F". So AB is congruent to DF. So the length of AB equals the length of DF. So AB = DF.

But how do we relate AB and DF to other parts?

First, let's consider the circle O. Points C and E are on the circle because OC and OE are radii. Therefore, the length of OC and OE are radii of the circle. So OC = OE = r, where r is the radius.

Then, CE is a chord connecting points C and E. The length of CE is given as 9x. The length of a chord can be found if we know the central angle subtended by the chord. The formula for the length of a chord is 2r sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle in radians. Alternatively, if we have the arc length, but here we have the measure of arc AD, which is 2x + 14. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe there's a relationship between arc AD and the chord CE. However, arc AD is mentioned, but CE is another chord. Unless points A and D are related to the circle? Wait, the problem doesn't explicitly state that A and D are on the circle. Wait, let me check the given predicates again.

Looking back, the only circle mentioned is Circle(O). The points C and E are on the circle since they are endpoints of radii. Are points A and D on the circle? Not directly stated. However, since there's a line AB and a line DF, and right angles at those points... Maybe we need to infer something else.

Alternatively, maybe points A and D lie on the circle? Because arc AD is mentioned. Arcs are part of a circle, so if arc AD exists, then points A and D must be on the circle. Therefore, A and D are points on the circle centered at O. So, points A, D are on the circle, making arc AD part of the circumference. Therefore, OA and OD are radii of the circle. Hence, OA = OD = r. 

So, points A and D are on the circle, so OA and OD are radii. Therefore, OA = OD = OC = OE = r.

Now, considering that, let's see. The arc measure of AD is 2x + 14. In a circle, the measure of an arc is equal to the measure of its central angle. So, the central angle corresponding to arc AD would be ∠AOD, which is equal to the measure of arc AD, which is 2x + 14 degrees. 

Now, let's think about the chord CE. Its length is 9x. As mentioned earlier, the chord length depends on the central angle subtending it. Let's denote the central angle for chord CE as θ. Then, CE = 2r sin(θ/2). But we need to find θ. How can we find θ?

Is there a way to relate θ to other angles or arcs? For instance, if we can find the measure of arc CE, then θ would be that measure. However, the problem does not mention arc CE directly. But maybe there's a relation between arcs AD and CE through other given information.

Alternatively, maybe there's a connection between the right angles given. Let's look at the right angles. 

We have a right angle at B in triangle CBA. So triangle ABC is right-angled at B. Similarly, triangle EFD is right-angled at F. These could imply certain relationships. For example, in triangle ABC, since it's right-angled at B, AB and BC are legs, and AC is the hypotenuse. Similarly, in triangle EFD, DF and EF are legs, FD is the hypotenuse. 

But how do these triangles relate to the circle? Well, points C and E are on the circle. Maybe points A and D are also on the circle, as discussed before. So, for example, if point A is on the circle, then OA is a radius, and similarly for D. 

Let me try to visualize this. Suppose we have a circle with center O. Points A and D are on the circle. Then, line AB is connected to point B, forming a right angle at B with point C. Similarly, line DF connects to point F, forming a right angle at F with point E. 

Alternatively, perhaps triangles ABC and DEF are right triangles, with AB and DF being one leg each. But without more info on the positions of B, F, etc., it's tricky. Maybe we need to use coordinates or other methods.

Alternatively, maybe AB and DF are chords or secants of the circle? Or maybe AB and DF are tangents? Not sure yet. Let's think differently.

Given that AB ≅ DF, so AB = DF. Also, we have CE = 9x. And arc AD = 2x + 14. Perhaps there's a way to express AB and DF in terms of the circle's radius and angles, and set them equal?

Alternatively, maybe triangles ABC and DEF are related via the circle's properties. For example, if AB is a tangent to the circle at point A, then AB would be perpendicular to OA. But is that the case here?

Wait, the right angle at B in triangle ABC: if AB were a tangent to the circle at A, then OA would be perpendicular to AB. But unless we know that AB is tangent, we can't assume that. However, since point C is on the circle, and angle at B is right, maybe there's a property here.

Alternatively, since triangle ABC has a right angle at B, and point C is on the circle, maybe AB is tangent to the circle at point A. Because if AB is tangent to the circle at A, then OA is perpendicular to AB. Which would make angle OAB a right angle. However, we have angle at B being right, so maybe there's a relation here.

Let me explore this possibility. Suppose AB is tangent to the circle at A. Then OA is perpendicular to AB. So OA ⊥ AB. Given that OA is a radius, and AB is tangent at A. Now, triangle ABC has a right angle at B. So, in triangle ABC, angle at B is right, and if AB is tangent, then OA is perpendicular to AB. So OA is perpendicular to AB, which would mean OA || BC? Wait, not necessarily. Let me draw this mentally.

If OA is perpendicular to AB, and angle at B is right, then BC would be along BA extended? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe triangle ABC is such that AB is tangent, and BC is a chord. But without knowing more about point C's position, it's hard to say. However, we know that point C is on the circle, so OC is a radius.

Similarly for the other right angle at F. If DF is tangent to the circle at D, then OD is perpendicular to DF. Which would make angle ODF a right angle. And since angle at F is right, that might fit.

Assuming that AB is tangent at A and DF is tangent at D, then OA ⊥ AB and OD ⊥ DF. So OA is perpendicular to AB, and OD is perpendicular to DF. 

In that case, OA and OD are both radii, and AB and DF are tangent segments. Then, AB and DF would be equal in length if the tangents from a common external point are equal. Wait, but AB and DF are different lines. Unless points A and D are related somehow. But the problem says AB ≅ DF, so AB = DF.

Alternatively, maybe AB and DF are both tangent segments from points outside the circle. But unless there's a common external point, this may not hold. However, if AB and DF are both tangent segments from the same external point, then their lengths would be equal. But we don't have info about that.

Alternatively, maybe AB and DF are sides of squares or rectangles related to the circle. But again, not sure.

Another thought: since arc AD measures 2x + 14 degrees, and we might relate that to the central angle AOD. Also, CE is a chord whose length is 9x. Let's recall that the length of a chord is 2r sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle. So, if we can find the central angle for chord CE, we can relate it to r and 9x.

But how to find that central angle? Maybe there's a way to find the measure of arc CE, which would correspond to the central angle. But how?

Alternatively, since points A and D are on the circle, and arc AD is given, perhaps there's a relationship between arc AD and arc CE through other given information.

Alternatively, looking back at the right angles. For triangle ABC right-angled at B, and point C on the circle. If OA is perpendicular to AB (assuming AB is tangent), then OA is perpendicular to AB, and since OA is a radius, that gives a right angle. Also, in triangle ABC, angle at B is right, so maybe AB is tangent. Similarly for DF.

Assuming AB is tangent at A, then OA is perpendicular to AB. Thus, OA ⊥ AB. Similarly, if DF is tangent at D, then OD ⊥ DF. 

So, OA ⊥ AB and OD ⊥ DF. 

Therefore, OA and OD are perpendicular to AB and DF respectively. 

Now, AB ≅ DF implies that AB = DF. So the lengths of the tangent segments AB and DF are equal. 

But tangent segments from a single external point are equal. However, AB and DF are from different points. Unless points A and D are related in some way. Wait, if AB is tangent at A, and DF is tangent at D, then the lengths of the tangents from points B and F to the circle would be AB and DF respectively. But unless points B and F are equidistant from the circle, we can't say much. However, given that AB = DF, maybe there's some symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe AB and DF are both equal to the length of the tangent from their respective external points. But without more info on where B and F are located, it's challenging. 

Alternatively, perhaps triangles OAB and ODF are right triangles? Because OA is perpendicular to AB, making triangle OAB a right triangle at A. Similarly, triangle ODF is right-angled at D. 

So, triangle OAB: right-angled at A, with OA = r (radius), and AB being the tangent. Then, AB can be expressed using Pythagoras. But wait, AB is tangent, so OB is the hypotenuse of triangle OAB. Wait, no: OA is perpendicular to AB, so triangle OAB is right-angled at A. So OA^2 + AB^2 = OB^2. But we don't know OB. 

Similarly for triangle ODF: right-angled at D, so OD^2 + DF^2 = OF^2. Again, OF is unknown. 

But since AB = DF, we have OA^2 + AB^2 = OB^2 and OD^2 + DF^2 = OF^2. But OA = OD = r, and AB = DF. So substituting:

For AB: r² + AB² = OB²  
For DF: r² + DF² = OF²  

But since AB = DF, then OB² = OF², implying OB = OF. So points B and F are equidistant from O. But without more info on where B and F are, this might not help directly. 

However, maybe there's a way to link this with the arc AD measure. Since arc AD is 2x + 14, and OA and OD are radii, the central angle AOD is 2x + 14 degrees. So the angle between vectors OA and OD is 2x + 14 degrees. 

Now, if we can find relations between angles in triangles OAB and ODF, or relate them to the central angle AOD. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between AB, DF, and the arc AD. For instance, if AB and DF are related to the arcs they intercept or something. 

Alternatively, since arc AD is 2x + 14, and CE is a chord of length 9x. Let's think about CE. Points C and E are on the circle, so the chord CE corresponds to the arc CE. The length of chord CE is 9x, which equals 2r sin(theta/2), where theta is the central angle for arc CE. So:

CE = 2r sin(theta/2) => 9x = 2r sin(theta/2).

But we need to find theta. How?

Is there a way to relate theta to arc AD? Maybe through other given information. 

Alternatively, if we can find the measure of arc CE, which would depend on other angles. But how?

Wait, considering the right angles at B and F. Let's go back to triangle ABC right-angled at B. Since point C is on the circle, and OA is a radius. If AB is tangent at A, then OA ⊥ AB. So OA is perpendicular to AB, which is one side of the right triangle. 

In triangle ABC, angle at B is right, so AB and BC are perpendicular. Also, OA is perpendicular to AB. So OA is parallel to BC? Because both are perpendicular to AB. Yes! If OA ⊥ AB and BC ⊥ AB, then OA is parallel to BC. 

Similarly, for triangle EFD right-angled at F, if DF is tangent at D, then OD ⊥ DF, and since angle at F is right, then EF ⊥ DF. So OD is parallel to EF.

This seems promising. So OA || BC and OD || EF. 

Now, since OA and OD are radii of the circle, their directions are determined by points A and D. 

But how does this help us? Maybe if we consider the angles between OA and OD, which is the central angle AOD = 2x + 14 degrees. If we can relate this angle to other angles in the diagram. 

Alternatively, maybe triangles ABC and EFD are similar or congruent? But without more info, not sure. 

Alternatively, since OA || BC and OD || EF, then maybe there's a parallelogram involved? For example, if OA || BC and OD || EF, but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, since OA is parallel to BC, then the direction of BC is the same as OA. Similarly, EF is parallel to OD. 

But how does this relate to the rest? Maybe the angle between OA and OD relates to the angles in the triangles. 

Alternatively, since OA is parallel to BC, then angle between OA and AB is 90 degrees, and angle between BC and AB is 90 degrees. 

Wait, maybe we can find some relations between the lengths AB and BC. In triangle ABC, which is right-angled at B, AB² + BC² = AC². But we don't know AC. However, since point C is on the circle, AC might be a chord or something else. 

Wait, OA is a radius, and OC is a radius. So OA = OC = r. So triangle OAC has OA and OC as radii. So triangle OAC is isoceles with OA = OC. Therefore, angles at A and C are equal. 

But how does that relate to triangle ABC? 

Alternatively, since OA is parallel to BC, and OA is a radius, maybe we can find BC in terms of OA? 

Let me think. If OA is parallel to BC, then vector OA is in the same direction as vector BC. But without coordinate system, it's hard to quantify. 

Maybe assigning coordinates would help. Let me try to model this.

Let me place the circle with center O at origin (0,0). Let me assign coordinates to various points to simplify. 

Let’s suppose point A is at (r, 0), since it's on the circle. Then, OA is along the positive x-axis. Since OA is parallel to BC, and OA is horizontal (from (0,0) to (r,0)), then BC should also be horizontal. 

But point B is somewhere, and point C is on the circle. Since triangle ABC is right-angled at B, and BC is horizontal. Let's assume point B is somewhere, and point C is on the circle. 

But this might get complicated. Let me try. 

Let me define point A as (r, 0). Then OA is along x-axis. Since OA is parallel to BC, BC is horizontal. So BC is horizontal. Since triangle ABC is right-angled at B, then AB and BC are perpendicular. Since BC is horizontal, AB must be vertical. 

So if BC is horizontal, then AB is vertical. So point B is somewhere, and AB is vertical. Let me assume point B is at (h, k), then AB is vertical, so points A and B share the same x-coordinate. Since A is at (r, 0), then B would be at (r, k) for some k. 

Then, BC is horizontal, so point C has the same y-coordinate as B, i.e., k. So point C is at (c, k), since BC is horizontal. But point C is on the circle. 

So coordinates of C: (c, k), satisfying c² + k² = r². 

Also, since BC is horizontal, the length BC is |c - r|, because B is at (r, k), and C is at (c, k). 

Also, AB is the vertical segment from A(r,0) to B(r,k), so its length is |k - 0| = |k|. 

In triangle ABC, right-angled at B, AB² + BC² = AC². 

AB² = k²  
BC² = (c - r)^2  
AC² = (c - r)^2 + (k - 0)^2 = (c - r)^2 + k². 

Which checks out. 

But also, since point C is on the circle, c² + k² = r². 

So substituting into AC²: (c - r)^2 + k² = (c² - 2rc + r²) + k² = (c² + k²) - 2rc + r² = r² - 2rc + r² = 2r² - 2rc = 2r(r - c). 

Hmm. Not sure if helpful yet. 

But maybe we can find relations between AB and BC. Since AB is |k|, and BC is |c - r|. 

But how does this relate to other parts of the problem? 

Additionally, since OA is parallel to BC, which is horizontal, and OA is along x-axis. 

But maybe there's another condition. Since point C is on the circle, and we have c² + k² = r². 

But we also have that AB = |k|, and BC = |c - r|. 

But without more constraints, it's difficult to proceed. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a relation between arc AD and the positions of points. 

Earlier, we had arc AD measures 2x + 14 degrees, which corresponds to central angle AOD = 2x + 14 degrees. 

Assuming point D is another point on the circle. Let me assign coordinates to D. Suppose point D is at angle θ from point A. For simplicity, let me assume that point D is at angle φ, so that the central angle AOD is φ - 0 = φ = 2x + 14 degrees. 

But this is getting too abstract. Maybe there's another approach. 

Let me recall that the length of chord CE is 9x. Since points C and E are on the circle, and CE is a chord. Earlier, we said that the length of chord CE is 2r sin(theta/2), where theta is the central angle subtended by CE. 

So if we can find theta, we can write 9x = 2r sin(theta/2). 

But how to find theta? 

Perhaps there's a way to relate theta to the arc AD. For example, if arc AD and arc CE are supplementary or complementary, but there's no direct info. 

Alternatively, if there's a relationship between the angles in triangles ABC and EFD. 

Wait, going back to the right angles. In triangle ABC, which is right-angled at B, and in triangle EFD right-angled at F. 

If AB and DF are equal, and assuming that AB and DF are tangent segments, then maybe there's a relation between the arcs they intercept. 

Alternatively, since OA is perpendicular to AB and OD is perpendicular to DF, and OA and OD are radii, then AB and DF are tangent lines at A and D respectively. 

Thus, AB is tangent at A, DF is tangent at D. 

In that case, the length of AB is equal to the length of the tangent from point B to the circle, and similarly DF is the length of the tangent from point F to the circle. 

But the length of a tangent from a point to a circle is sqrt(OB² - r²) for point B, and similarly for point F. 

So, AB = sqrt(OB² - r²) and DF = sqrt(OF² - r²). 

But since AB = DF, we have sqrt(OB² - r²) = sqrt(OF² - r²), implying OB = OF. 

So points B and F are equidistant from O. 

But how does this help us? 

Additionally, the arc AD measures 2x + 14 degrees. The central angle AOD is 2x + 14 degrees. 

But how does this relate to OB and OF? 

If points B and F are equidistant from O, then OB = OF. 

But without knowing where B and F are located relative to the circle, it's still unclear. 

Alternatively, maybe points B and F are related to the arc AD. For example, if points B and F are the midpoints of arcs or something. But this is speculation. 

Another idea: since AB is tangent at A, and DF is tangent at D, then AB and DF are both tangent lines to the circle. The angle between AB and AD might relate to the arc AD. 

But I'm stuck. Let me try to think of another way. 

We have two equations involving x:

1. Measure of arc AD = 2x + 14.
2. Length of CE = 9x.

And we need to find x, given that AB ≅ DF. 

But how to relate these? 

Maybe there's a relationship between arc AD and the chord CE. For example, if arc AD and arc CE are related through some geometric property. 

Wait, but unless there's a cyclic quadrilateral or something involving these arcs. 

Alternatively, since CE is a chord, and arc CE corresponds to a central angle, say phi. Then, 9x = 2r sin(phi/2). 

Also, arc AD is 2x + 14, which is the central angle AOD. 

If we can find another equation relating r and x, we can solve for x. 

But how? 

Let me think about triangle ABC. It's right-angled at B. If AB is tangent at A, then AB = sqrt(OB² - r²). 

Similarly, for DF, DF = sqrt(OF² - r²). Since AB = DF, then OB = OF. 

So, OB = OF. 

But how to find OB or OF in terms of other variables? 

Alternatively, if we can express OB in terms of r and arc AD. 

But I don't see a direct relation. 

Wait, what if we consider that points B and F are positioned such that lines AB and DF are tangent, and arc AD is related to the positions of B and F? 

Alternatively, maybe the angle between AB and AD is equal to half the arc AD? No, that's for inscribed angles. 

Wait, the angle between tangent AB and chord AD would be equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc. 

Yes! There's a theorem that says the angle between a tangent and a chord is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc. 

So, in this case, AB is tangent at A, and AD is a chord. The angle between tangent AB and chord AD is equal to half the measure of the arc from A to D. 

So, angle BAD = ½ * measure of arc AD. 

Similarly, for the other tangent DF and chord DA, but I need to verify. 

Wait, in our case, AB is tangent at A, and AD is a chord from A to D. So the angle between tangent AB and chord AD is equal to half the measure of arc AD. 

So, angle BAD = ½ * measure of arc AD = ½*(2x + 14) = x + 7 degrees. 

Similarly, for the other tangent DF at D, and chord DA, the angle between tangent DF and chord DA would be half the measure of arc DA. Wait, but arc DA is the same as arc AD, just traversed in the opposite direction. So the measure is the same, 2x + 14 degrees. 

But in triangle ABC, angle at B is right, and angle BAD is x + 7 degrees. Let's see. 

In triangle ABC, right-angled at B, angle at B is 90 degrees. What is angle at A? 

Angle at A in triangle ABC is angle BAC. Let me think. 

Point A is on the circle, and AB is tangent at A. The angle between tangent AB and chord AC would be equal to half the measure of arc AC. But we don't know arc AC. 

Wait, but we have angle BAD = x + 7, where angle BAD is the angle between AB and AD. So angle BAD is x + 7. 

But angle BAD is part of triangle ABD. Wait, but I don't know about point D. 

Alternatively, in triangle ABC, angle at A is angle BAC. Let me try to relate this. 

Since angle BAD is x + 7, and angle BAC is part of that. If points C and D are related, but I don't know. 

Alternatively, if I consider that angle BAC is equal to angle BAD minus angle DAC. But without knowing where C is relative to AD, this is speculative. 

But maybe there's a way to relate angle BAD to other angles. 

Alternatively, since angle BAD is x + 7, and in triangle ABC, which is right-angled at B, we might relate angles. 

In triangle ABC, angles sum to 180 degrees. So angle at B is 90°, angle at A is angle BAC, angle at C is angle ACB. 

But unless we can find a relationship between angle BAC and angle BAD, it's not helpful. 

Wait, if point C is on the circle, and AB is tangent at A, then AC is a secant. The angle between tangent AB and secant AC is equal to half the measure of arc AC. 

So, angle between AB and AC is equal to half arc AC. 

But we don't know arc AC. 

But if we can express arc AC in terms of other arcs. 

Alternatively, if we consider that arc AC plus arc AD equals arc CD, but again, without knowing the positions of C and D, this is uncertain. 

This seems too vague. Let me try to find another approach. 

Let me recall that CE is a chord of length 9x. From earlier, CE = 2r sin(theta/2), where theta is the central angle for arc CE. So, 9x = 2r sin(theta/2). 

If I can find theta, then I can relate it to other variables. 

But how to find theta? 

Maybe theta is related to the arc AD. For example, if points C and E are positioned such that arc CE is supplementary or complementary to arc AD. 

Alternatively, if there's a relationship between the arcs due to the right angles. 

Wait, in triangle ABC, which is right-angled at B, and AB is tangent at A, then angle between AB and AC is half arc AC. Let's call that alpha = ½ arc AC. 

Similarly, in triangle EFD, right-angled at F, and DF is tangent at D, then angle between DF and DE is half arc DE. Let's call that beta = ½ arc DE. 

But without knowing where C and E are, it's hard to relate these angles. 

Alternatively, if points C and E are symmetric in some way. 

Alternatively, since points C and E are both on the circle, and CE is a chord. If we can find the central angle for CE, then we can relate it to the other information. 

But I need more connections. 

Wait, maybe the fact that AB ≅ DF allows us to set up an equation between the tangent lengths. 

From earlier, AB = sqrt(OB² - r²) and DF = sqrt(OF² - r²). Since AB = DF, then OB = OF. 

So, OB = OF. 

But how to relate OB and OF to arc AD? 

If points B and F are such that OB and OF are radii-related? Or perhaps points B and F are located such that angle AOD is related to angles involving B and F. 

Alternatively, if we consider that angle AOD is 2x + 14 degrees, and if there's a relationship between OB and OF with respect to this angle. 

But I'm stuck. Let me try to think about the arc AD and the chord CE. 

Suppose that arc AD is 2x + 14, and arc CE is some value. If we can relate arc CE to arc AD, maybe through the right angles. 

But I need to find a way to connect these. 

Wait, going back to the tangent and angle between tangent and chord. 

For the tangent AB at A, the angle between AB and AD is x + 7 degrees (as calculated earlier). 

Similarly, for the tangent DF at D, the angle between DF and DA is x + 7 degrees (since arc AD is the same). 

So, angle between AB and AD is x + 7, and angle between DF and DA is x + 7. 

Now, in triangle ABC, which is right-angled at B, angle at A is angle BAC. Let's see if we can relate angle BAC to x + 7. 

Since angle BAD is x + 7, and if point C lies on AD, then angle BAC would be x + 7. But unless point C is on AD, which isn't specified. 

Alternatively, if point C is such that AC is the same as AD, but that's not given. 

Alternatively, if angle BAC is equal to angle BAD, which is x + 7. 

But without knowing where point C is, this is guesswork. 

Let me try to imagine that point C is such that AC is a diameter. But why would that be? 

Alternatively, since OC is a radius, and if AC is a radius, but OC is already a radius. So if A is on the circle, then OA is a radius. If AC is also a radius, then C would be at a distance r from A, but that would require specific positioning. 

This is getting too vague. Let me try to find another angle. 

Let me recall that CE = 9x and arc AD = 2x + 14. If I can find an equation linking these, maybe through the circle's properties. 

Suppose that the central angle for arc CE is equal to the central angle for arc AD. Then, 2x + 14 = theta, and CE = 2r sin(theta/2). But without knowing r, this is not helpful. 

Alternatively, if there's a relationship between the chord CE and the arc AD. For example, if arc CE is twice arc AD, or something like that. 

But without more info, it's impossible to say. 

Wait, maybe there's a relationship between the right angles and the arcs. 

For example, in triangle ABC, right-angled at B, and AB is tangent at A, then angle between AB and AC is half the arc AC. Similarly for the other triangle. 

But unless we can find arc AC or arc DE, this isn't helpful. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Let me try to summarize what I know:

- CE = 9x = 2r sin(theta/2), where theta is the central angle for arc CE.
- Arc AD = 2x + 14, which is the central angle AOD.
- AB = DF, which are tangent lengths: AB = sqrt(OB² - r²), DF = sqrt(OF² - r²) ⇒ OB = OF.
- Angle between tangent AB and AD is x + 7.
- Angle between tangent DF and DA is x + 7.

But I need to find x. Let me think about possible ways to connect these. 

Maybe the central angle for arc CE is related to the sum or difference of other angles. For example, if arc CE is equal to arc AD plus something. 

Alternatively, if points C and E are positioned such that arc CE is equal to arc AD. But why? 

Alternatively, if the total circle is 360 degrees, and arc AD is 2x + 14, and other arcs add up to the remaining. 

But without knowing other arcs, this is not helpful. 

Wait, but if we can find the measure of arc CE in terms of x, then we can set up an equation with CE = 9x. 

But how? 

Let me assume that arc CE is equal to arc AD, so theta = 2x + 14. Then, CE = 2r sin((2x + 14)/2) = 2r sin(x + 7). 

But we also have CE = 9x. So, 9x = 2r sin(x + 7). 

But we need another equation to relate r and x. 

Where can I get another equation? 

Maybe from the tangent lengths AB and DF. 

Since AB = sqrt(OB² - r²), and if we can express OB in terms of x. 

But how? 

If I can relate OB to the central angle AOD. 

For example, if point B is such that OB is related to the arc AD. 

But without knowing where B is, this is difficult. 

Wait, earlier, we had angle BAD = x + 7. In triangle ABC, right-angled at B, angle at A is angle BAC. Let's say angle BAC = α. Then, in triangle ABC, α + 90 + angle at C = 180 → angle at C = 90 - α. 

But angle BAC is also related to the tangent. From the tangent-chord angle theorem, angle between AB and AC is half the arc AC. 

So, angle BAC = ½ arc AC. 

So, α = ½ arc AC. 

But arc AC is equal to arc AD plus arc DC, or something. 

But without knowing where point C is, it's hard to say. 

But if I assume that point C is such that arc AC is equal to arc AD, then α = ½ arc AD = (2x + 14)/2 = x + 7. 

So, angle BAC = x + 7. 

But in triangle ABC, angle at A is x + 7, angle at B is 90°, so angle at C is 90 - (x + 7) = 83 - x degrees. 

But how does this help? 

Maybe using the Law of Sines or Cosines in triangle ABC. 

In triangle ABC, right-angled at B, so:

AB / sin(angle at C) = AC / sin(90°) = AC.

So, AB = AC * sin(angle at C).

But angle at C is 83 - x, and angle at A is x + 7. 

So, AB = AC * sin(83 - x). 

But AC is the hypotenuse, and AB is one leg. 

Alternatively, using Pythagoras: AB² + BC² = AC². 

But without knowing BC or AC, it's not helpful. 

But if I can express AC in terms of r. 

Since point C is on the circle, AC is a chord from A to C. The length of AC can be found using the central angle between A and C. 

Let me call the central angle for arc AC as phi. Then, AC = 2r sin(phi/2). 

But I don't know phi. 

Unless phi is related to other angles. 

But this seems to be going in circles. 

Let me try to take a different approach. Let's assume that the arc AD is 2x + 14, and the length of CE is 9x. Let's try to relate these using the circle's properties. 

If I can find the measure of arc CE in terms of x, then I can write an equation. 

But how? 

Wait, if I can relate arc CE to arc AD through the right angles. 

For example, if the central angle for arc CE is equal to twice the angle between the tangents. 

But earlier, we had angle between tangent AB and AD is x + 7. If there's a relationship between this angle and arc CE. 

Alternatively, if the central angle for arc CE is 2*(angle BAD), which is 2*(x + 7). 

So, theta = 2x + 14. 

Then, CE = 2r sin(theta/2) = 2r sin(x + 7). 

But we also have CE = 9x. So, 9x = 2r sin(x + 7). 

But we need another equation to relate r and x. 

Where can this come from? 

Maybe from the tangent lengths AB and DF. 

Since AB = sqrt(OB² - r²), and if we can find OB in terms of r and x. 

But how? 

Let me think about the angle between AB and AD being x + 7. In triangle ABD, if we can find some relations. 

But without knowing BD or other sides, it's difficult. 

Alternatively, if point B is such that OB is related to the central angle AOD. 

For example, if angle AOB is related to the central angle AOD. 

But this is too vague. 

Wait, let me try to assume that the central angle for arc CE is 2x + 14, same as arc AD. Then, CE = 2r sin(x + 7) = 9x. 

But without knowing r, this is one equation with two variables. 

But perhaps there's another equation from the tangent lengths. 

If AB = sqrt(OB² - r²), and if we can relate OB to r. 

If I assume that OB is equal to the length of AB, but that would mean AB = sqrt(OB² - r²) ⇒ AB = sqrt(AB² - r²) ⇒ AB² = AB² - r² ⇒ r = 0, which is impossible. 

No, that doesn't work. 

Alternatively, if OB is related to the central angle AOD. 

For example, if angle AOD is 2x + 14, and if OB is related to that angle. 

But without knowing where B is, this is not helpful. 

I'm really stuck here. Let me try to think of possible values for x from the options given (1, 2, 3, 4) and see if any of them satisfy the conditions. 

Let's test x=2. Then, arc AD = 2*2 +14 = 18 degrees. CE = 9*2 = 18. So, if arc AD is 18 degrees, and CE is 18. If the central angle for CE is also 18 degrees, then CE = 2r sin(9) ≈ 2r * 0.1564. But CE is 18, so 18 = 2r * 0.1564 → r ≈ 18/(0.3128) ≈ 57.5. But without knowing r, this doesn't help. 

But maybe there's a relationship where the central angle for CE is equal to the arc AD. If arc AD is 2x+14 and CE is 9x, then if 2x+14 = 2*theta, where theta is the central angle for CE. But unless there's a reason why theta = 2x +14, it's arbitrary. 

Alternatively, if arc CE is equal to arc AD, then 9x = 2r sin((2x+14)/2). But still two variables. 

Wait, but if we assume that the central angle for arc CE is equal to arc AD, then we have 9x = 2r sin((2x +14)/2). But we need another equation to relate r and x. 

Maybe from the tangent lengths. 

If AB = DF, and AB is the tangent from B to the circle, then AB = sqrt(OB² - r²). 

But if I can find OB in terms of r. 

Let me assume that OB is such that angle AOB is equal to the central angle AOD, which is 2x +14. 

But why? 

If point B is such that OB makes an angle of 2x +14 with OA. 

But this is just a guess. 

Let me say that angle AOB is equal to the central angle AOD, which is 2x +14. Then, OB = r, since it's a radius? No, OB is not necessarily a radius. 

Wait, OB is the distance from O to B, which is not necessarily a radius. 

But if I assume that OB is such that angle AOB is equal to the central angle AOD, then OB would be related to the position of B. 

But this is too vague. 

At this point, I think I need to make an assumption to proceed. Let's assume that the central angle for arc CE is equal to the central angle for arc AD, i.e., 2x +14. Then, CE = 9x = 2r sin((2x +14)/2). 

But we also have from the tangent lengths: AB = sqrt(OB² - r²) = DF = sqrt(OF² - r²). But if OB = OF, and if we can relate OB to r. 

If I assume that OB is equal to the length of AB, but this leads to contradictions. 

Alternatively, if OB is equal to the length of CE, which is 9x. So, OB = 9x. Then, AB = sqrt( (9x)^2 - r^2 ). 

But how to relate r and x? 

If I can find another equation involving r and x. 

From the arc AD = 2x +14, and if I assume that the central angle for arc AD is 2x +14, then the length of the chord AD is 2r sin( (2x +14)/2 ). 

But we don't have info about AD's length. 

But if we can relate AD to other parts. 

For example, if AD is the same as CE, but no, CE is 9x and AD is a chord. 

Alternatively, if AD is a diameter, then its length is 2r. But we don't know. 

But this is too many assumptions. 

Let me try plugging in the answer choices. 

Option C is x=3. Let's see:

If x=3, then arc AD = 2*3 +14 = 20 degrees.
