====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, we have a rectangle ABCD with some points and lines mentioned. The question asks for the measure of angle 8, given that angle 2 is 40 degrees. Hmm, first I need to visualize the rectangle and where the points E are located. 

Let me start by recalling that in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. Also, the diagonals of a rectangle are equal in length and bisect each other. Wait, but there's a point E involved here. The problem states that E lies on both diagonals AC and BD. That means E is the intersection point of the diagonals of the rectangle. In a rectangle, diagonals bisect each other, so E should be the midpoint of both diagonals. But wait, the given lengths involve segments like AE, EC, BE, ED, etc. Let me check the given lengths again.

From the predicates, we have:
- Length of AE is 1 unit.
- Length of EC is 7 units. So the entire diagonal AC would be AE + EC = 1 + 7 = 8 units. Similarly, since E is on BD, BE is 6 units and ED is 4 units, making BD = 6 + 4 = 10 units. Wait, but in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal. However, according to these lengths, AC is 8 and BD is 10? That contradicts the property that diagonals in a rectangle are equal. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I misread the given data. Let me check again. The problem says:

"Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,E)), 1)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,C)), 7)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,E)), 6)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,D)), 4)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), 2)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,D)), 3)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,D)), 5)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,D)), 3)"

Wait, hold on. The line BD has length 3? Because Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,D)), 3). But earlier, from E being on BD, BE=6 and ED=4, making BD=10. This inconsistency suggests something is wrong. Maybe my assumption that E is the midpoint is incorrect? Or perhaps the given data isn't consistent? But the problem says Quadrilateral ABCD is a rectangle, so diagonals must be equal. Therefore, if BD is supposed to be one diagonal, its length should be equal to AC. But according to the given, AC is 8 (from AE=1 and EC=7) and BD is 10 (from BE=6 and ED=4). That's conflicting. How can this be?

Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding. Let me re-examine the predicates. The Rectangle(A,B,C,D) implies that ABCD is a rectangle. Then, Diagonal(Line(A,C), Rectangle(A,B,C,D)) and Diagonal(Line(B,D), Rectangle(A,B,C,D)). So, AC and BD are the two diagonals of the rectangle. Therefore, they should be equal in length. However, according to the given lengths, AC = AE + EC = 1+7=8, and BD = BE + ED = 6+4=10. These are unequal. That seems impossible unless the problem has conflicting information. But that can't be. There must be a mistake in my interpretation.

Wait, maybe the line BD isn't a diagonal? Wait, the Rectangle(A,B,C,D) has vertices A, B, C, D. In a rectangle, the order matters. Typically, rectangles are labeled such that AB, BC, CD, DA are consecutive sides. So, the diagonals would be AC and BD. For example, in a rectangle ABCD, the diagonals connect A to C and B to D. So, yes, BD is a diagonal. Therefore, their lengths must be equal. But according to the given data, BD is 10 and AC is 8. Contradiction. So either the problem is inconsistent, or I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the given lengths aren't along the diagonals? Wait, the problem says Point E lies on both diagonals AC and BD. Therefore, E is the intersection point of the diagonals. In a rectangle, diagonals bisect each other, so E should be the midpoint. Therefore, AE should equal EC, and BE should equal ED. But here, AE=1 and EC=7, implying that E divides AC into parts of 1 and 7, which would mean it's not the midpoint. Similarly, BE=6 and ED=4, so E divides BD into 6 and 4. This contradicts the property of rectangles' diagonals. Hence, this suggests that the given data may not form a rectangle? But the problem states that ABCD is a rectangle. So, there must be an error in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the labels of the rectangle are different? Let me think about how the rectangle is labeled. Suppose the rectangle is A, B, C, D arranged in order. Then AB is adjacent to BC, which is adjacent to CD, etc. The diagonals are AC and BD. So if E is on both diagonals, then E is the center. But the given lengths don't align with that. Unless... wait, maybe the coordinates are not Euclidean? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem involves vectors or coordinate geometry? Let me consider assigning coordinates to the rectangle.

Let me assign coordinates to the rectangle. Let’s assume point A is at (0, 0). Since AB is 2 units (given LengthOf(Line(A,B))=2), and AD is 5 units (LengthOf(Line(A,D))=5). Wait, because in the given, Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,D)), 5). Wait, but in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So, if AB is horizontal and AD is vertical, then AB=2, AD=5. Then, coordinates would be A(0,0), B(2,0), D(0,5), and C(2,5). Then the diagonals AC and BD would be from A(0,0) to C(2,5) and B(2,0) to D(0,5). The midpoint of AC would be (1, 2.5), and midpoint of BD would also be (1, 2.5). So E should be at (1, 2.5). But according to the given, the distances from E to A is 1, and from E to C is 7. Let me compute the distance from A(0,0) to E(x,y): sqrt((x)^2 + (y)^2) = 1. And from E(x,y) to C(2,5): sqrt((2-x)^2 + (5-y)^2) =7. Also, from B(2,0) to E(x,y) is 6: sqrt((x-2)^2 + y^2)=6. From E(x,y) to D(0,5): sqrt(x^2 + (5-y)^2)=4.

So, we have four equations:

1. sqrt(x² + y²) = 1 → x² + y² = 1
2. sqrt((2−x)² + (5−y)²) = 7 → (2−x)² + (5−y)² = 49
3. sqrt((x−2)² + y²) = 6 → (x−2)² + y² = 36
4. sqrt(x² + (5−y)²) = 4 → x² + (5−y)² = 16

Hmm, let's see if these equations are consistent. Let me write them out:

Equation 1: x² + y² = 1  
Equation 3: (x−2)² + y² = 36  
Subtract equation 1 from equation 3:  
(x−2)² + y² − x² − y² = 36 − 1 → (x² −4x +4) −x² = 35 → -4x +4 = 35 → -4x = 31 → x = -31/4 = -7.75  

Then plug x back into equation 1: (-7.75)² + y² = 1 → 60.0625 + y² = 1 → y² = -59.0625. Which is impossible. So contradiction. Hence, the given data cannot exist. But the problem says ABCD is a rectangle. So there's a contradiction here. What does this imply?

This suggests that the given data is inconsistent with the properties of a rectangle. However, the problem is presented as solvable. Therefore, perhaps my initial assumption about the labeling of the rectangle is wrong? Let me reconsider the arrangement of the rectangle.

Maybe the rectangle is labeled differently. For instance, suppose the rectangle is A, B, C, D arranged such that AB and CD are the vertical sides, and BC and DA are the horizontal sides. Wait, but regardless of the orientation, the diagonals AC and BD should still be equal. Alternatively, perhaps the given lengths refer to different lines? Wait, the problem mentions Line(B,D) as a diagonal. Let me check the given lengths again. 

In the given, Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,D)), 3). Wait, that would mean that BD has length 3. But earlier, from E lying on BD, BE=6 and ED=4, so BD=10. Again, conflict. So this suggests that either there's a misinterpretation of which lines are which, or the problem contains errors. Alternatively, maybe the lines mentioned are not the diagonals? But the predicate says Diagonal(Line(B,D), Rectangle(...)), so BD is a diagonal.

Wait, maybe the problem uses non-Euclidean geometry? Probably not. Or perhaps the given lengths are not Euclidean distances but something else? Unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the problem statement? But assuming the problem is correctly formulated, there must be another way.

Wait, perhaps the point E is not inside the rectangle? But the problem states that E lies on both diagonals, so it should be inside. Alternatively, maybe E is outside? But then the diagonals extended beyond the rectangle would have E outside, but the problem says PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(A,C)) and PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(B,D)), so E is on the lines AC and BD. If the lines are extended, then E could be outside. Let me explore that possibility.

Suppose that E is outside the rectangle, on the extension of the diagonals. For example, if the rectangle is ABCD with diagonals AC and BD intersecting at the center O. If E is not O but somewhere else on the line AC extended, then AE and EC would not be halves. But even so, the lengths would have to satisfy certain relations. Let me attempt this.

But before that, maybe I should check the given lengths again. Let's list all the given lengths:

- AB = 2
- BD = 3 (since Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,D)), 3))
- AD = 5
- CD = 3 (since Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,D)), 3))
- AE = 1
- EC = 7
- BE = 6
- ED = 4

Wait, but if BD is 3, then BE + ED = 6 + 4 = 10, which contradicts BD = 3. So this is impossible. Therefore, there's a contradiction in the given data. However, the problem is presented as solvable. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding. Perhaps the line BD is not a diagonal? Let me check the original predicates again.

Original predicates:

Diagonal(Line(A,C), Rectangle(A,B,C,D))

Diagonal(Line(B,D), Rectangle(A,B,C,C,D))

Wait, the second one is Diagonal(Line(B,D), Rectangle(A,B,C,D))? Wait, the user wrote:

"Diagonal(Line(A,C),Rectangle(A,B,C,D))

Diagonal(Line(B,D),Rectangle(A,B,C,D))"

Yes, so both AC and BD are diagonals of the rectangle. Thus, their lengths should be equal. But according to the given lengths, AC = AE + EC = 1 + 7 = 8, BD = BE + ED = 6 + 4 = 10. Hence, AC ≠ BD, contradicting the rectangle's properties. So this suggests that the given data is inconsistent. But the problem says ABCD is a rectangle. So there must be an error in my interpretation of the given data.

Wait, perhaps the line BD is not a diagonal? Wait, no—the predicate says it's a diagonal. Alternatively, maybe the rectangle has been defined incorrectly. For example, maybe the rectangle is not convex? No, rectangles are always convex. 

Alternatively, maybe the given lengths are not along the diagonals but along other lines? Wait, the problem says:

PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(A,C)) and PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(B,D)). So E is on both diagonals. Hence, the lengths AE, EC, BE, ED are along those diagonals. So the problem is contradictory. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem setup. But since the problem is given, maybe there's a different interpretation.

Wait, perhaps the lengths given are not the actual lengths but projections? Or maybe the problem refers to vector magnitudes instead of Euclidean distances? That seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the diagram is not drawn to scale, and the given lengths are hypothetical?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about a rectangle but another shape? But the first predicate says Rectangle(A,B,C,D). So it's definitely a rectangle. 

Given this contradiction, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the inconsistency and proceed with the given data? For example, treat the diagonals as having lengths 8 and 10, and find angle measures based on that. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the given lengths are not for the diagonals but for other lines? Let me recheck the predicates:

The equals statements are:

Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,E)), 1)

Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,C)), 7)

Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,E)), 6)

Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,D)), 4)

Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), 2)

Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,D)), 3)

Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,D)), 5)

Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,D)), 3)

Ah! Wait, the length of Line(B,D) is 3. But earlier, I thought that Line(B,D) was a diagonal. But if BD is a side? Wait, in a rectangle, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So BD would be a diagonal. But if Line(B,D) is considered as a side, then BD would be a side, not a diagonal. Wait, but in a rectangle, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So BD connects B to D, which are two vertices not adjacent, hence it's a diagonal. So why is the length of BD given as 3? Because in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal. But if BD is a diagonal, then its length should be equal to AC. But according to the given, AC = 8 and BD = 3. Contradiction. 

Wait, but maybe the line BD is not a diagonal but a side? If that were the case, then the rectangle would have sides AB=2, BD=3, etc., but that wouldn't fit. Let me try to imagine. Suppose ABCD is a rectangle with sides AB=2, BC=?, CD=3, DA=?. Wait, but then the sides must be perpendicular. For example, AB and AD are adjacent sides. If AB=2 and AD=5 (as per LengthOf(Line(A,D))=5), then BC=AD=5, CD=AB=2. But the given LengthOf(Line(C,D))=3, which would not match. So this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the given LengthOf(Line(B,D))=3 refers to a side, but then BD would be a side, implying that B and D are adjacent, which would make the rectangle have sides AB, BC, CD, DA. But then BD would be a diagonal. So this is confusing.

At this point, I realize there's a fundamental inconsistency in the given data. However, since the problem is posed, perhaps I need to proceed under the assumption that despite the apparent contradictions, there's a way to interpret the given data. Let me try to focus on the part about angles. The question is about angle 2 and angle 8. But without knowing which angles these are, it's hard to proceed. Wait, the problem says m∠2 = 40°, and asks for m∠8. Presumably, these are angles formed by the intersection of lines at point E, or elsewhere.

Since E is on both diagonals, and the diagonals intersect at E, forming various angles. In a typical rectangle, the diagonals bisect each other and form vertical angles. However, if E is not the midpoint (due to the given lengths), then the angles at E would depend on the ratio of the segments.

Assuming that E is on both diagonals AC and BD, with AE=1, EC=7, BE=6, ED=4. Even though this contradicts the rectangle's properties, perhaps we can use the ratios to find the angles.

Let me consider triangle AEB and others. For example, in triangle AEB, we know AE=1, BE=6, and AB=2. Wait, AB is given as 2. So triangle AEB has sides AE=1, BE=6, and AB=2. But by triangle inequality, AE + BE > AB → 1 + 6 =7 > 2, which holds. But also, AE + AB > BE → 1 + 2 =3 >6? No, 3 <6, which violates the triangle inequality. Hence, this is impossible. So this confirms that the given data is inconsistent. 

Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding. Perhaps the lengths are not along the straight lines but along some other paths? Or maybe the problem uses directed lengths or signed distances? That seems unlikely. 

Alternatively, perhaps the given lengths are not Euclidean distances but something else, like vectors? But even then, the triangle inequality would still apply. 

At this point, I'm stuck because the given data leads to contradictions. However, since the problem is presented as solvable, perhaps I need to overlook the inconsistencies and proceed with the given data, assuming that it's correct, and derive the angles accordingly. Let me try that.

Assume that E is on both diagonals AC and BD, with AE=1, EC=7, BE=6, ED=4. Despite the fact that this contradicts the rectangle properties, proceed. Now, consider the angles at point E. Let's say angle 2 is one of the angles formed at E, and angle 8 is another. To find the relationship between them.

For example, in the intersection of diagonals AC and BD at E, four angles are formed. Let's call them ∠AEB, ∠BEC, ∠CED, and ∠DEA. These angles are vertically opposite pairs. Also, adjacent angles are supplementary. 

But the problem mentions angle 2 and angle 8. Without knowing which angles these are, it's difficult. But typically, in such problems, angles are labeled sequentially around the point. For example, if we label the angles at E as follows:

- Between EA and EB: ∠AEB = angle 2
- Between EB and EC: ∠BEC
- Between EC and ED: ∠CED
- Between ED and EA: ∠DEA

If angle 2 is ∠AEB = 40°, then what is angle 8? Assuming angle 8 is one of the other angles. For example, if angle 8 is ∠DEA, then it would be vertically opposite to ∠BEC, or supplementary to ∠AEB.

Wait, but to calculate these angles, we might need more information. For example, using the law of cosines in triangles involving E.

Take triangle AEB: sides AE=1, BE=6, AB=2. Wait, earlier we saw that this violates the triangle inequality. But if we proceed anyway, applying the law of cosines:

cos(angle AEB) = (AE² + BE² - AB²)/(2*AE*BE)

Plugging in numbers:

cos(angle AEB) = (1² + 6² - 2²)/(2*1*6) = (1 + 36 - 4)/12 = (33)/12 = 11/4 = 2.75

Which is greater than 1, which is impossible. Hence, angle AEB cannot exist. This confirms the inconsistency.

Thus, the given data is invalid. However, since the problem exists, perhaps there's a different interpretation. Maybe the lengths are not AE, EC, BE, ED but other segments? For example, maybe the lengths are not along the diagonals but other lines? But the problem states that E lies on the diagonals, so it should be along them.

Alternatively, perhaps the lengths are not for the full diagonals but for parts of other lines? Like, maybe E is not on the diagonals but on some other lines? No, the predicates say PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(A,C)) and PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(B,D)).

I'm really stuck here. Given that, maybe the intended approach is to ignore the inconsistencies and proceed with the given lengths to find the angles. Let me try that, even though it leads to contradictions.

Assume that E is the intersection of diagonals AC and BD, with AE=1, EC=7, BE=6, ED=4. Then, the ratio of AE/EC = 1/7, and BE/ED = 6/4 = 3/2. In a rectangle, the diagonals bisect each other, so AE/EC = 1, but here it's 1/7. Hence, the figure is not a rectangle. But the problem says it is. So this is a paradox. 

Perhaps the problem meant to say that ABCD is a parallelogram instead of a rectangle? In a parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other, so AE = EC and BE = ED. But given AE=1, EC=7, BE=6, ED=4, this is also not satisfied. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a trapezoid? But then the diagonals aren't necessarily equal or bisecting. 

At this point, I think there must be a misprint in the problem. For example, maybe the length of Line(B,D) is 10 instead of 3? Or some other correction. Without resolving this, it's impossible to proceed. 

However, since the problem requires an answer, and the options are given, maybe I should look for another approach. Let's forget the rectangle and focus on the angles. The question gives m∠2 = 40° and asks for m∠8. In many geometry problems, especially with intersecting lines, angles can be determined using properties of vertical angles, linear pairs, or triangles.

Assuming that ∠2 and ∠8 are related via some geometric property. For example, if they are vertical angles, they would be equal. If they are supplementary, their sum would be 180°. If they are complementary, sum to 90°. But without knowing their exact positions, it's challenging.

Alternatively, if E is the intersection of diagonals, and angle 2 is one of the angles at E, then depending on which angle it is, angle 8 could be another. For example, if angle 2 is ∠AEB = 40°, then angle 8 could be ∠CED, which is vertical to ∠AEB, making it also 40°. Or if angle 8 is adjacent, it would be 180 - 40 = 140°, but none of the options include 140. Or if angle 8 is part of a triangle where we can use the given lengths to find it.

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's guesswork. However, since the problem includes a rectangle, and diagonals, maybe there's a standard angle relationship. For example, in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and the angles formed at the intersection are 90°, but that's only if the rectangle is a square. Otherwise, the angles depend on the aspect ratio.

Wait, in a general rectangle, the diagonals divide each other into segments, and the angles formed at the intersection can be found using trigonometry. For example, if the diagonals are divided into segments of lengths p and q, then the tangent of half of one angle would be (p/q). But this is speculative.

Assuming that the given lengths are for the segments of the diagonals, even though they contradict the rectangle properties. Let's say AC is split into AE=1 and EC=7, so total AC=8. BD is split into BE=6 and ED=4, total BD=10. In a rectangle, diagonals are equal, so this would suggest that the given data is for a non-rectangle, but the problem says it is. Still, proceeding...

If we consider the diagonals as AC=8 and BD=10, then the rectangle's sides can be found using Pythagoras. For example, if the diagonals are d1 and d2, but in a rectangle, they're equal. But here, they're not. So this is not applicable. 

Alternatively, treating it as a kite, but then the diagonals are not equal. 

Alternatively, considering the triangle formed by the diagonals and the sides. But I'm not sure.

Another idea: since the problem mentions angle 2 and angle 8, and provides answer choices, maybe it's referring to angles in a triangle formed by E and other points. For example, if angle 2 is in triangle ABE, and angle 8 is in another triangle. Let's try.

In triangle ABE, we have sides AE=1, BE=6, and AB=2. As before, this triangle is impossible due to the triangle inequality. So this approach fails.

Alternatively, perhaps the lengths are not for the diagonals but for other lines. For example, Line(A,E) is not a diagonal but another line. Wait, the problem says PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(A,C)), so E is on AC, which is a diagonal. Same for BD. So the lengths are along the diagonals.

Given all this confusion, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the intended lengths are different. For example, if the length of Line(B,D) is 10 instead of 3, then BD=10, matching AC=8? No, still not equal. Or if Line(B,D) is 8, matching AC=8. Let's assume that the length of Line(B,D) is 8 instead of 3. Then, BE + ED = 6 + 4 = 10, which would be inconsistent. Alternatively, if Line(B,D) is 10, then BE=6 and ED=4 would make BD=10, matching AC=8? No. 

Alternatively, if Line(B,D) is 8, then BD=8, and AC=8, making it consistent. So maybe there's a typo in the given data, and the length of Line(B,D) is 8 instead of 3. With that, let's proceed.

Assuming that Line(B,D) has length 8, then BE + ED = 6 + 4 = 10, which is inconsistent. Wait, no. If BD is 8, then BE + ED = 8. But BE=6 and ED=4 gives 10, which is too long. So this doesn't work.

Alternatively, if BE=3 and ED=5, making BD=8. But the given says BE=6 and ED=4. 

This is getting too convoluted. Given the time I've spent without progress, perhaps I should consider that the problem intends for us to use the given lengths to form triangles and use the Law of Cosines or Sines to find angles, ignoring the rectangle properties.

For example, if we take triangle ABE with AE=1, BE=6, and AB=2. Even though it's impossible, let's proceed:

Using Law of Cosines to find angle at E (which is angle AEB):

cos(angle AEB) = (AE² + BE² - AB²) / (2*AE*BE) = (1 + 36 - 4) / 12 = 33/12 = 2.75. As before, which is invalid.

So this approach is invalid.

Alternatively, if the lengths are for other triangles. For example, if we consider triangle BED with BE=6, ED=4, and BD=10 (assuming BD=10). Then, using Law of Cosines to find angle at E.

cos(angle BED) = (BE² + ED² - BD²)/(2*BE*ED) = (36 + 16 - 100)/48 = (-48)/48 = -1. So angle BED is 180°, which means points B, E, D are colinear, which they are, but this doesn't help.

This suggests that all approaches lead to contradictions, indicating a flaw in the problem. 

Given that, and since the question asks for m∠8 given m∠2=40°, and the options are A-D, maybe the intended answer is based on the assumption that the diagonals intersect at E, and angle 2 is one of the angles formed, and angle 8 is its supplement or something.

For example, if angle 2 is 40°, and it's one of the angles at E, then the opposite angle is also 40°, and the adjacent angles are 140° each. If angle 8 is one of the larger angles, then it would be 140°, which is not among the options. But the options are A.40, B.50, C.80, D.100. None of these are 140. 

Alternatively, if angle 2 is part of a triangle where we can use the given lengths to find it. For example, if angle 2 is in triangle ABE, but as shown, the triangle is invalid. 

Alternatively, if the problem refers to angles in the rectangle itself, like angles at the corners. For example, if angle 2 is one of the angles of the rectangle, but all angles in a rectangle are 90°, so that doesn't fit. 

At this point, I'm forced to conclude that there's likely a typo in the problem, and the correct answer is likely B.50 or C.80, based on common angle relationships. For example, if angle 2 is 40°, and angle 8 is its complement or supplement. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's impossible to say. 

Alternatively, if the problem is about a transversal cutting through parallel lines, creating alternate interior angles or something. For example, if angle 2 is 40°, and angle 8 is corresponding or alternate, then it would also be 40°, but that's option A. Or if it's supplementary, 140°, but not in options. 

Since the options include 50 and 80, which are commonly seen in problems with triangles, perhaps using the triangle angle sum. For example, if angle 2 is part of a triangle where other angles add up to 140°, leading to angle 8 being 50 or 80. But without concrete info, it's just guessing.

Given the lack of clarity, and the options provided, and assuming that the problem intends for angle 8 to be supplementary to angle 2, giving 140°, which is not an option. Or if angle 2 is part of a triangle where the other angles are 50 and 90, making angle 8 50. Or if it's part of a triangle with angles adding to 180, and angle 8 is the third angle. 

If angle 2 is 40°, and the other two angles in a triangle sum to 140°, then angle 8 could be 50° or 80°, depending on the situation. 

Since the options include B.50 and C.80, and without further info, I'll guess that the answer is B.50, assuming some standard angle relationship. But this is purely a guess.
