<think>
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. So, the question is asking for EG, where G is the incenter of triangle ABC. Let me start by recalling what an incenter is. The incenter is the point where the angle bisectors of a triangle meet, and it's equidistant from all sides of the triangle. Also, the incenter is the center of the incircle, which touches each side of the triangle.

Now, looking at the given predicates, I need to parse all the information. First, there's a triangle ABC. Then there are several lines mentioned: Line(A,D), Line(C,D), Line(A,B), Line(B,E), Line(B,F), Line(B,G). There are also right angles specified: Angle(A,E,B) is a right angle, Angle(E,B,F) is a right angle, Angle(G,B,F) is a right angle, and Angle(G,D,C) is a right angle. Additionally, the lengths of Line(B,F) is 12 units, and Line(B,G) is 13 units.

Wait, so points E, F, G are connected to point B. Since there are right angles at those points, maybe we're dealing with some right triangles here. Let me try to visualize this. 

Starting with triangle ABC. Points D, E, F, G are connected to other points. Let me note down the coordinates or relations. But since coordinates aren't given, perhaps I should use coordinate geometry? Or maybe use properties of incenters and right angles?

First, since there are multiple right angles, perhaps some of these lines form right triangles. For example, Angle(A,E,B) being a right angle suggests that BE is perpendicular to AB. Similarly, Angle(E,B,F) is a right angle, so BF is perpendicular to BE. Wait, but BE and BF would be perpendicular? That would make triangle EBF a right triangle with right angle at B. Similarly, Angle(G,B,F) is a right angle, so BG is perpendicular to BF. And Angle(G,D,C) is a right angle, so GD is perpendicular to DC.

But how does this relate to triangle ABC? Let me think. The incenter G is involved. In a triangle, the incenter lies at the intersection of angle bisectors. However, given that there are right angles at various points, maybe triangle ABC has some right angles itself? Or perhaps some of its angles are right angles?

Alternatively, maybe triangle ABC is a right triangle. Let me check the given right angles. The Angle(A,E,B) is a right angle. If that's part of triangle ABC, then maybe AB is one leg, and BE another? Not sure yet. Let me try to map out the figure step by step.

Let me consider point B. From B, there are lines to E, F, G. Also, there's a line from A to B, and from B to C. Also, there's a line from A to D and from C to D, making AD and CD connected at D. Also, there's a right angle at GDC, so GD is perpendicular to DC.

Also, given that Length(BF)=12 and Length(BG)=13. Since G is the incenter, maybe BF and BG are related to the inradius or something else? Wait, BF is a segment from B to F, which is connected to E and G. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps triangle EBF is a right triangle with legs BE and BF, since angles at E and B are right angles? Wait, Angle(E,B,F) is a right angle, so that means at point B, between E and F, forming a right angle. Therefore, BE is perpendicular to BF. Similarly, Angle(G,B,F) is a right angle, so BG is perpendicular to BF. Therefore, both BE and BG are perpendicular to BF. Which would mean that BE and BG are colinear? Because they are both perpendicular to the same line BF. Wait, unless they are in different planes, but assuming this is planar geometry.

So if BE and BG are both perpendicular to BF, then BE and BG lie along the same line. Therefore, points E, B, G are colinear? Wait, but BE and BG are two different segments from B, both perpendicular to BF. That would imply that E and G are on the same line perpendicular to BF at point B. Therefore, points E, B, G are aligned such that BE and BG are parts of the same line. Wait, but that would mean that E and G are on opposite sides of B? Or same side? Depending on direction.

But if that's the case, then maybe E and G are on the same line through B, perpendicular to BF. Now, since G is the incenter, which lies inside the triangle ABC. So, perhaps BF is an angle bisector? Or maybe it's related to the ex-circle or something else?

Alternatively, considering that G is the incenter, so it lies at the intersection of angle bisectors. So, if BG is an angle bisector of angle B. Wait, but angle at B of triangle ABC. Let me recall that in a triangle, the incenter lies at the intersection of the angle bisectors. So, if BG is an angle bisector, then it splits angle B into two equal parts.

But in our case, BG is perpendicular to BF. So, if BG is an angle bisector, and BF is perpendicular to it, then angle between BG and BF is 90 degrees. So, angle between BG and BF is 90 degrees. But BF could be another line, like maybe an altitude or median?

Wait, let me try to think again. Since there's a right angle at Angle(G,B,F), that is, at point B between G and F. So, the lines BG and BF are perpendicular. So, BG ⊥ BF. If BG is an angle bisector, then BF might be a line that forms some relationship with the angle at B.

Alternatively, maybe BF is the external angle bisector? Not sure yet.

Also, given that BF = 12 and BG = 13. These are lengths from B to F and B to G. Since G is the incenter, perhaps BG is the length from vertex B to the incenter. There's a formula for the distance from the vertex to the incenter. Wait, yes! The distance from a vertex to the incenter can be calculated using the formula involving the angles of the triangle. Alternatively, maybe we can find the inradius first.

But wait, in a triangle, the inradius r is given by area divided by semiperimeter. However, without knowing the sides of the triangle, it's hard to compute directly. But maybe we can find relations using the given data.

Alternatively, since there are right angles, maybe triangle ABC is a right triangle. Let me check if that's possible.

Looking back, there's a right angle at Angle(A,E,B). So, if that's part of triangle ABC, then maybe AB is a leg, and AE is another. Wait, but E is connected to B via a line. Maybe E is a point outside the triangle? Not sure yet.

Alternatively, since there are multiple right angles, maybe multiple right triangles are present. Let me focus on the right angles:

- Angle(A,E,B): right angle at B between A and E.
- Angle(E,B,F): right angle at B between E and F.
- Angle(G,B,F): right angle at B between G and F.
- Angle(G,D,C): right angle at D between G and C.

So, starting from point B, we have lines BE, BF, BG, all emanating from B. Since BE and BG are both perpendicular to BF, as per the right angles, then BE and BG are colinear. So, points E, B, G are colinear, lying on a straight line perpendicular to BF. Hence, E and G are on opposite sides of B along that line.

Therefore, the line EG passes through B, with E and G on either side. So, EG is the distance from E to G, which would be EB + BG if they are on opposite sides. Wait, but we don't know EB's length yet. However, given that BG is 13 units. Wait, the length of BG is given as 13. But we need to find EG, which depends on EB and BG.

But how do we find EB?

Alternatively, since G is the incenter, and BG is the angle bisector of angle B. Given that BG is perpendicular to BF, which implies that BF is the other line. Wait, if BG is an angle bisector and is perpendicular to BF, then maybe BF is the external angle bisector?

Alternatively, let's consider that in triangle ABC, the incenter lies at G. So, BG is the bisector of angle B. Therefore, the angle between BG and BA equals the angle between BG and BC. But since BG is perpendicular to BF, which may be another line.

Alternatively, maybe BF is the internal angle bisector? No, because if BG is the angle bisector and is perpendicular to BF, then BF would be perpendicular to the angle bisector. That seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at B. Because there are multiple right angles mentioned. Let's assume that ABC is a right triangle with right angle at B. Then, the incenter G would be located somewhere inside the triangle. In a right triangle, the inradius can be found by r = (a + b - c)/2, where c is the hypotenuse. But I'm not sure yet.

Wait, if ABC is a right triangle at B, then AB and BC are legs, and AC is the hypotenuse. The inradius r = (AB + BC - AC)/2. But how does that relate to the given data?

Additionally, given that BF is a segment from B to F, which is 12 units long. If BF is the angle bisector of angle B, then in a right triangle, the length of the angle bisector can be calculated. But I'm not certain about the formula here.

Alternatively, since BG is perpendicular to BF, and BG is the angle bisector, then BF could be the external angle bisector. Wait, but in that case, the internal and external angle bisectors are perpendicular. Yes! In a triangle, the internal and external angle bisectors at a vertex are perpendicular to each other. Because the sum of the internal and external angles at a vertex is 180 degrees, so their bisectors would split them into 90 degrees each. Therefore, if BG is the internal angle bisector of angle B, and BF is the external angle bisector, then BG and BF are perpendicular. That fits with the given right angle at G,B,F.

Ah! This seems promising. So, BF is the external angle bisector of angle B, and BG is the internal angle bisector. Therefore, the internal and external angle bisectors are perpendicular, hence BG ⊥ BF. That explains the right angle at G,B,F.

In that case, since BF is the external angle bisector, and BG is the internal angle bisector, their lengths can be related to the sides of the triangle. Also, since G is the incenter, the distances from G to the sides of the triangle are equal to the inradius.

But how do we connect this with the given lengths BF=12 and BG=13? Let me recall that in a triangle, the length of the internal angle bisector can be calculated, and similarly for the external angle bisector. However, I need to recall the formula for the length of the internal and external angle bisectors.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the formula for the distance from the vertex to the incenter. The distance from vertex B to the incenter G can be expressed in terms of the triangle's angles and sides.

Another approach: In triangle ABC, with internal angle bisector BG and external angle bisector BF. Since they are perpendicular, we can relate the lengths BG and BF.

Let me denote the triangle ABC with right angle at B. Suppose AB = c, BC = a, AC = b. Wait, standard notation is usually AB = c, BC = a, AC = b, but in a right triangle at B, AB and BC are the legs, and AC is the hypotenuse.

Wait, if ABC is a right triangle at B, then AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2. The inradius r = (AB + BC - AC)/2.

But how does that help us? Also, the internal angle bisector of angle B in a right triangle... Let me find the length of BG, the internal angle bisector.

The formula for the length of the internal angle bisector from angle B in triangle ABC is given by:

BG = (2ac / (a + c)) * cos(B/2)

But since ABC is a right triangle at B, angle B is 90 degrees. Therefore, cos(B/2) = cos(45°) = √2/2.

So, BG = (2ac / (a + c)) * (√2/2) ) = (ac√2)/(a + c).

Similarly, the length of the external angle bisector from B. The external angle bisector divides the exterior angle at B, which is 180° - 90° = 90°, so the external angle bisector would split that into two 45° angles. Wait, the external angle bisector would be the bisector of the supplementary angle. Wait, for a right angle, the external angle is 90°, so the external angle bisector would divide it into two 45° angles. Therefore, the external angle bisector BF makes a 45° angle with the extension of AB or BC.

Alternatively, the length of the external angle bisector can be computed. But maybe there's a relation between BG and BF since they are perpendicular. Let me think.

Since BG and BF are perpendicular, and BG is the internal angle bisector, BF is the external angle bisector. In a right triangle, perhaps there's a way to express their lengths in terms of the sides.

Alternatively, since BG and BF are perpendicular, the product of their slopes would be -1. But without coordinates, this might not be helpful. Alternatively, using vectors or trigonometry.

Alternatively, since BG and BF are perpendicular, and both originate from B, and BG is the internal angle bisector, BF the external, then maybe the ratio of their lengths relates to the adjacent sides.

Wait, there's a formula for the length of the internal and external angle bisectors. Let me recall that.

For the internal angle bisector length from angle B:

BG = (2ac/(a + c)) * cos(B/2)

As before.

For the external angle bisector, the formula is more complex, but in the case of a right triangle, maybe we can derive it.

Alternatively, since the external angle bisector of angle B would form an angle of 45° with the sides. Wait, in a right triangle at B, the external angle bisector would go outward. For example, extending AB beyond B, and BC beyond B, then the external angle bisector would be the line that splits the angle formed by extending AB and BC.

Wait, the external angle bisector of angle B would be the line that splits the angle formed by the extension of AB and BC. Since angle at B is 90°, the external angle is 90°, so the external angle bisector would split it into two 45° angles.

Therefore, the external angle bisector BF would make a 45° angle with the extensions of AB and BC.

Alternatively, since the internal angle bisector BG divides the 90° angle into two 45° angles. Wait, no. Wait, in a right triangle, the internal angle bisector of the right angle would split it into two 45° angles. Wait, but that would make BG a line that splits angle B (which is 90°) into two 45° angles. So, BG would be the line that makes 45° with AB and BC. But earlier, we said that BG is perpendicular to BF, which was the external angle bisector. But if BG is already splitting the internal angle into two 45°, then BF (external angle bisector) would be perpendicular to BG. Which aligns with the given condition that BG ⊥ BF.

So, in this scenario, BG is the internal angle bisector (splitting the right angle into two 45°), and BF is the external angle bisector (splitting the external angle into two 45°). Thus, they are perpendicular, as given.

Therefore, in this case, the internal angle bisector BG and external angle bisector BF are perpendicular. Their lengths are BG = 13 and BF = 12, as given.

Now, we need to find EG, which is the distance between E and G. Earlier, we thought that E and G are on the same line perpendicular to BF. Since BG is the internal angle bisector (from B at 45°), and BF is the external angle bisector (also at 45° from the extended sides), but since they are perpendicular, then points E and G lie along the same line through B, perpendicular to BF.

Wait, but BF is the external angle bisector. If BF is the external angle bisector, then it goes outward from B. So, if we imagine the right triangle ABC with right angle at B, then extending AB and BC, the external angle bisector BF would be going in the direction away from the triangle. Meanwhile, the internal angle bisector BG would be going towards the incenter inside the triangle.

But how does this relate to points E and F? Let me see:

Given that Angle(E,B,F) is a right angle, meaning that at point B, the lines BE and BF form a right angle. So, BE is perpendicular to BF. Since BF is the external angle bisector, BE must be perpendicular to it. So, BE is a line from B, perpendicular to BF. Given that BF is the external angle bisector, BE would be in the direction of the internal angle bisector? Or maybe not. Wait, if BF is the external angle bisector, then BE is perpendicular to it. So, BE is a line from B that's perpendicular to BF. In this case, since BF is the external angle bisector, which is at 45° relative to the sides, then BE would be at a 90° angle to BF. So, depending on the orientation, BE could be aligned with the internal angle bisector BG?

Wait, earlier we had that BG is the internal angle bisector, which is at 45° to AB and BC. But BF is the external angle bisector, which is at 45° to the extended sides. Since BG and BF are perpendicular, then BE, which is perpendicular to BF, would be aligned with BG? Because if BF is at 45° to the extended sides, then BE being perpendicular to BF would be at 45° to BF, which might align with BG. 

Wait, perhaps E lies along BG? Because BE is perpendicular to BF, and BG is perpendicular to BF. So, BE and BG are both perpendicular to BF, implying they are colinear. So, E lies on the line BG. Therefore, E is along the internal angle bisector BG. But since BE is a segment from B to E, and G is also on that line, then E could be on the extension of BG beyond B, or between B and G.

But given that Angle(A,E,B) is a right angle, which suggests that BE is perpendicular to AB. Wait, angle at E, B, A is a right angle. So, the angle between EA and EB is 90 degrees. So, EA is perpendicular to EB. Therefore, EA ⊥ EB. So, if BE is part of the line BG (the internal angle bisector), then EA is perpendicular to BG.

This seems getting complicated. Maybe I should assign coordinates to the points to simplify calculations.

Let me place the right triangle ABC with right angle at B. Let’s set coordinate system with point B at origin (0,0). Let’s suppose AB is along the x-axis and BC is along the y-axis. So, point B is at (0,0). Let’s say point A is at (c, 0) and point C is at (0, a), making AB = c, BC = a, and AC = sqrt(a² + c²). 

The incenter G of triangle ABC can be found using the formula for coordinates of incenter: ( (a*A_x + b*B_x + c*C_x ) / perimeter , ... ). Wait, more accurately, the incenter coordinates are given by weighted average: ( (a*x_A + b*x_B + c*x_C ) / (a+b+c), same for y-coordinates ), where a, b, c are the lengths of sides opposite to vertices A, B, C respectively. Wait, actually, in standard notation, the incenter coordinates are ( (a x_A + b x_B + c x_C ) / (a + b + c), ... ). Wait, no, the formula is weighted by the lengths of the sides. Specifically, if the sides opposite to A, B, C are of lengths a, b, c respectively, then the incenter coordinates are ( (a x_A + b x_B + c x_C ) / (a + b + c), (a y_A + b y_B + c y_C ) / (a + b + c) ).

Wait, but in our case, since ABC is a right triangle at B, with AB = c, BC = a, and AC = sqrt(a² + c²). Let me denote AB = c, BC = a. Then, the incenter coordinates can be calculated as follows.

Alternatively, in a right triangle, the inradius r = (AB + BC - AC)/2 = (c + a - sqrt(a² + c²))/2.

Coordinates of incenter: in a right triangle, the inradius is r, and the incenter is located at (r, r) from the right-angle vertex. Wait, yes! Because in a right triangle, the inradius is r = (AB + BC - AC)/2, and the incenter is located at distances r from each leg. So, since AB is along x-axis from (0,0) to (c,0), and BC is along y-axis from (0,0) to (0,a), the incenter G would be at (r, r), where r = (AB + BC - AC)/2 = (c + a - sqrt(a² + c²))/2.

So, coordinates of G are (r, r).

Now, the internal angle bisector from B (which is the line BG) goes from (0,0) to (r, r), so its slope is 1, meaning it's along the line y = x. Therefore, the internal angle bisector BG is along the line y = x.

Now, the external angle bisector BF. How do we find its equation?

The external angle bisector at B. Since angle at B is 90°, the external angle is 90°, so the external angle bisector will divide this external angle into two 45° angles. To find its direction, we can use the formula for external angle bisector.

Alternatively, since the internal and external angle bisectors are perpendicular, and BG is along y=x, then the external angle bisector BF should be perpendicular to BG. Since BG has slope 1, BF should have slope -1. Therefore, BF is the line y = -x. Wait, but since it's an external angle bisector, it should extend in the direction away from the triangle.

Wait, in our coordinate system, point B is at (0,0). The internal angle bisector BG goes towards the interior of the triangle, i.e., along y=x, which would be towards the first quadrant. The external angle bisector BF would be in the opposite direction, along the line y = -x, extending into the second quadrant. So, BF is the line y = -x.

So, the line BF is y = -x. Now, the length of BF is given as 12. Let me calculate the length from B to F along this line. However, point F lies on the external angle bisector BF. But where exactly? Well, in general, the external angle bisector can be extended infinitely, but the length BF refers to the segment from B to F. However, without knowing where F is located, we need to find F's position.

But how? Since BF is the external angle bisector, and in this case, it's the line y=-x. The length BF is 12. Assuming that F is a point along this line at distance 12 from B. So, coordinates of F would be (t, -t) such that the distance from B(0,0) is sqrt(t² + t²) = t√2 = 12 → t = 12/√2 = 6√2. So, F is at (6√2, -6√2).

Now, the line BE is perpendicular to BF. Since BF is along y=-x, which has slope -1, then BE, being perpendicular, has slope 1. Therefore, BE is along the line y = x. But wait, BG is already along y=x. Therefore, point E lies along the line y=x, since BE is along that line. So, E is a point along y=x, at some distance from B. 

But Angle(A,E,B) is a right angle. So, at point E, angle between EA and EB is 90°. Wait, the angle at E, between A-E-B. So, the angle at E between points A, E, B is a right angle. So, EA ⊥ EB. Since E is along the line y=x, and B is at (0,0), then BE is the segment from B(0,0) to E(s,t) along y=x, so s = t. Let's say E is at (k, k). Then vector BE is (k, k), and vector EA is from E(k,k) to A(c, 0), which is (c - k, -k). The dot product of BE and EA should be zero because they are perpendicular.

Dot product: (k)(c - k) + (k)(-k) = k(c - k) - k² = kc - k² - k² = kc - 2k² = 0 → kc = 2k² → c = 2k (assuming k ≠ 0).

Thus, c = 2k → k = c/2. So, coordinates of E are (c/2, c/2).

So, point E is at (c/2, c/2). 

Now, we also know that BG is the internal angle bisector, which we've determined goes to (r, r), where r = (a + c - sqrt(a² + c²))/2. And since BG has length 13, as given. Wait, the length of BG is from B(0,0) to G(r, r), so its length is sqrt(r² + r²) = r√2. Given that this length is 13, so r√2 = 13 → r = 13/√2 = 13√2/2.

But also, r = (a + c - sqrt(a² + c²))/2. So,

(a + c - sqrt(a² + c²))/2 = 13√2/2 → multiply both sides by 2:

a + c - sqrt(a² + c²) = 13√2.

Also, the length BF is 12. Earlier, we found that F is at (6√2, -6√2), so the distance from B(0,0) to F is 12, which checks out.

But how do we relate a and c? We need another equation. Let's recall that in the right triangle ABC, the inradius r is also given by r = (AB + BC - AC)/2, which we already used. Also, the inradius can be expressed as area/s, where s is the semi-perimeter.

Area of triangle ABC is (AB * BC)/2 = (a*c)/2.

Semi-perimeter s = (AB + BC + AC)/2 = (c + a + sqrt(a² + c²))/2.

Thus, r = area / s = [(a c)/2] / [(a + c + sqrt(a² + c²))/2] = (a c) / (a + c + sqrt(a² + c²)).

But earlier, we also have r = 13√2 / 2. So,

(a c) / (a + c + sqrt(a² + c²)) = 13√2 / 2.

Hmm, this seems complex. Perhaps there's another way. Remember that we also have the coordinates of E as (c/2, c/2). Also, since E lies on the line y = x, and we have a right angle at E between A-E-B. Also, the line BE is from B(0,0) to E(c/2, c/2), which is along y=x. 

Now, we also have that G is at (r, r) = (13√2 / 2, 13√2 / 2). Wait, because r = 13√2 / 2. So, coordinates of G are (r, r) = (13√2/2, 13√2/2). 

But we also have that G is the incenter, which is located at (r, r), so the coordinates of G depend on the sides a and c. But how can we find a and c?

Alternatively, since we have E at (c/2, c/2), and G at (r, r). So, the line EG connects E(c/2, c/2) to G(r, r). The length EG is |r - c/2| * sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) ? Wait, no. Since both points are along the line y=x, the distance between E and G is sqrt[(r - c/2)^2 + (r - c/2)^2] = sqrt[2*(r - c/2)^2] = |r - c/2| * sqrt(2).

So, EG = |r - c/2| * sqrt(2). Our goal is to find EG.

We need to find r and c. But we have equations involving a and c. Let me recall that r = (a + c - sqrt(a² + c²))/2 = 13√2 / 2. Also, the coordinates of E are (c/2, c/2), and point A is at (c, 0). So, the line EA goes from E(c/2, c/2) to A(c, 0). Let me verify if this satisfies the right angle at E.

Earlier, we derived that c = 2k, where k is the x-coordinate of E. Since we found that c = 2k, and E is at (k, k), so yes. But this doesn't involve a. So, how do we find a?

Alternatively, since ABC is a right triangle at B, with AB = c, BC = a, and AC = sqrt(a² + c²). The inradius r = (a + c - sqrt(a² + c²))/2. And we have r = 13√2 / 2.

But we also have another equation from the fact that the coordinates of G are (r, r). Also, the incenter coordinates in a right triangle are (r, r), so this gives us that the inradius r is equal to the distance from B to G along the axes. Therefore, the inradius is r, and the incenter is at (r, r).

But how does this relate to the other parameters?

Let me think. Also, the length BF is 12. As we calculated earlier, BF is along the line y=-x, and its length from B(0,0) is 12, which gave us the coordinates of F as (6√2, -6√2). But how does this relate to the triangle's sides?

Maybe there's another relation involving BF. Since BF is the external angle bisector, there might be a formula for the length of the external angle bisector. Alternatively, since we know the coordinates of F, perhaps we can find relations between a and c.

Alternatively, since F is on the external angle bisector, and we know its coordinates, perhaps we can find the relation between a and c.

Wait, in a triangle, the external angle bisector of angle B meets the external angle bisector of another angle at the ex-center. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, since F is on the external angle bisector of angle B, and we have coordinates of F as (6√2, -6√2), which is along y=-x. Let me consider the external angle bisector formula.

The external angle bisector of angle B can be found using the formula that involves the adjacent sides. For an external angle bisector, the ratio of the distances from the point to the sides is proportional to the adjacent sides. Wait, the external angle bisector theorem states that the external angle bisector divides the opposite side externally in the ratio of the adjacent sides. But since this is an external angle bisector, it might intersect the extension of side AC.

However, since we are working in coordinate geometry, maybe we can find the equation of the external angle bisector.

Alternatively, since we have coordinates for F, which lies on the external angle bisector, and we know that BF is length 12, and we also have the coordinates of F as (6√2, -6√2). Let me compute the distance from B(0,0) to F(6√2, -6√2):

Distance BF = sqrt((6√2)^2 + (-6√2)^2) = sqrt(72 + 72) = sqrt(144) = 12, which matches the given value. Good.

Now, since F lies on the external angle bisector of angle B, which in our coordinate system is the line y=-x. Now, how does this line relate to the triangle's sides?

The external angle bisector of angle B should pass through the ex-center opposite to A or C. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since we have coordinates of F, maybe we can find the relation between a and c.

But how? Let me think. In the external angle bisector of angle B, which is y=-x. This line passes through point F(6√2, -6√2). Also, the external angle bisector should satisfy the condition that the ratio of distances from any point on the bisector to the two sides forming the angle is equal to the ratio of the adjacent sides.

Wait, the external angle bisector theorem states that the external angle bisector of angle B divides the opposite side externally in the ratio of the adjacent sides. However, since this is an external angle bisector, it intersects the extension of side AC.

But in our case, since we have coordinates, maybe we can find the equation of the external angle bisector and ensure that it passes through F. 

Alternatively, since we have the coordinates of F, and the external angle bisector is y=-x, we can relate this to the triangle's sides.

Let me consider the external angle bisector of angle B. It should satisfy the condition that for any point on the bisector, the ratio of the distances to the two sides forming the angle is equal to the ratio of the adjacent sides. 

The two sides forming angle B are AB and BC. Their lengths are AB = c and BC = a. So, for any point on the external angle bisector, the ratio of the distances to AB and BC is equal to AB / BC = c/a. 

Point F is on the external angle bisector, so the distance from F to AB divided by the distance from F to BC = c/a.

Let me calculate these distances. 

First, AB is the horizontal line from B(0,0) to A(c, 0), which is the x-axis. The distance from point F(x,y) to AB (which is the x-axis) is the vertical distance, which is |y|. Similarly, BC is the vertical line from B(0,0) to C(0, a), which is the y-axis. The distance from F(x,y) to BC (the y-axis) is |x|.

So, the ratio of distances is |y| / |x| = c/a. 

For point F(6√2, -6√2), the distance to AB is |-6√2| = 6√2, and distance to BC is |6√2| = 6√2. So, the ratio is 6√2 / 6√2 = 1. Therefore, according to the external angle bisector theorem, c/a = 1 → c = a. 

Ah! So, this tells us that AB = BC, meaning that the triangle ABC is an isosceles right triangle, with legs AB and BC equal. Therefore, a = c.

So, now we know that a = c. Let's substitute a = c into our previous equations.

Recall that r = (a + c - sqrt(a² + c²))/2. Since a = c, this becomes:

r = (a + a - sqrt(a² + a²))/2 = (2a - sqrt(2a²))/2 = (2a - a√2)/2 = a(2 - √2)/2.

But we also know that r = 13√2 / 2. Therefore:

a(2 - √2)/2 = 13√2 / 2.

Multiply both sides by 2:

a(2 - √2) = 13√2.

Solving for a:

a = (13√2) / (2 - √2).

Rationalizing the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (2 + √2):

a = [13√2 (2 + √2)] / [(2 - √2)(2 + √2)] = [13√2 (2 + √2)] / (4 - 2) = [13√2 (2 + √2)] / 2.

Compute numerator:

13√2 * 2 = 26√2

13√2 * √2 = 13 * 2 = 26

So total numerator: 26√2 + 26 = 26(√2 + 1)

Therefore, a = 26(√2 + 1)/2 = 13(√2 + 1).

So, a = c = 13(√2 + 1).

Now, recall that point E is at (c/2, c/2) = [13(√2 + 1)/2, 13(√2 + 1)/2].

And point G is at (r, r) = (13√2 / 2, 13√2 / 2).

Now, we need to find the distance between E and G.

Coordinates of E: (13(√2 + 1)/2, 13(√2 + 1)/2)

Coordinates of G: (13√2 / 2, 13√2 / 2)

Difference in x-coordinates: [13(√2 + 1)/2] - [13√2 / 2] = [13√2 + 13]/2 - 13√2/2 = 13/2.

Same difference in y-coordinates: same as above, 13/2.

Therefore, the distance EG is sqrt[(13/2)^2 + (13/2)^2] = sqrt(2*(13/2)^2) = (13/2)*sqrt(2).

Which simplifies to 13√2 / 2.

Wait, but the question asks for EG. But according to this calculation, EG is 13√2 / 2. However, none of the answer choices are in terms of radicals. The options are A. 4, B. 5, C. 12, D. 13.

Wait, this suggests that my calculation might be wrong, or perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me check again.

Wait, the answer choices are numerical values, and my current result is 13√2 / 2 ≈ 9.19, which isn't among the options. So, there must be an error in my reasoning.

Where did I go wrong?

Let me retrace. I assumed that ABC is a right triangle at B, which led to the conclusion that a = c. But maybe that assumption is incorrect?

Wait, why did I conclude that a = c? Because the external angle bisector BF has point F(6√2, -6√2), and the ratio of distances from F to AB and BC is 1, leading to c/a = 1. But is that correct?

Yes, because for the external angle bisector, the ratio of the distances to the two sides is equal to the ratio of the adjacent sides. So, if the distances from F to AB and BC are equal, then c/a = 1 → c = a. So, that part seems correct.

Then, proceeding with a = c, and calculating r = 13√2 / 2, which leads to a = 13(√2 + 1), and then finding EG as 13√2 / 2. But since this isn't among the options, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe the assumption that ABC is a right triangle at B is incorrect? Let me revisit that.

The given right angles are Angle(A,E,B), Angle(E,B,F), Angle(G,B,F), and Angle(G,D,C). But I assumed that ABC is a right triangle at B based on the presence of a right angle at B in the Angle(A,E,B) and others. However, it's possible that ABC isn't necessarily a right triangle. My assumption might be incorrect.

Let me reconsider. Perhaps ABC is not a right triangle, and the right angles mentioned are part of other structures, not necessarily the triangle itself. So, my earlier assumption that ABC is a right triangle at B is possibly wrong.

This changes things. Let me try a new approach.

Let me start fresh, not assuming ABC is a right triangle.

Given that G is the incenter of triangle ABC. So, G is the intersection of the angle bisectors. Also, we have several right angles and lengths.

From the given predicates:

- RightAngle(Angle(A,E,B)): So, at point B, between A and E, there's a right angle. So, BE ⊥ AB.

- RightAngle(Angle(E,B,F)): At point B, between E and F, right angle. So, BF ⊥ BE.

- RightAngle(Angle(G,B,F)): At point B, between G and F, right angle. So, BG ⊥ BF.

- RightAngle(Angle(G,D,C)): At point D, between G and C, right angle. So, DG ⊥ DC.

Also, Line(A,B), Line(B,E), Line(B,F), Line(B,G), Line(A,D), Line(C,D), Line(D,C). 

So, points A, B, C, D are connected via lines, with D connected to A and C. Also, there are points E, F, G connected to B.

Let me try to draw this mentally. Point B is connected to A, E, F, G. Lines from A to D and from C to D. Also, DG is perpendicular to DC.

Since G is the incenter, it lies at the intersection of angle bisectors. Also, BG is an angle bisector of angle B, because the incenter lies on the angle bisectors.

But we also have that BG is perpendicular to BF. As before, this suggests that BF is the external angle bisector, since internal and external angle bisectors are perpendicular.

So, even without assuming ABC is a right triangle, we can proceed with this.

So, BG is the internal angle bisector of angle B, and BF is the external angle bisector, hence they are perpendicular. Therefore, the internal and external angle bisectors at B are perpendicular, implying that angle B is 90 degrees. Because the internal and external angle bisectors of an angle are perpendicular if and only if the original angle is 90 degrees. 

Because the internal angle bisector divides the angle into two equal parts, and the external angle bisector divides the supplement into two equal parts. If the original angle is θ, then the internal bisector creates θ/2, and the external bisector creates (180 - θ)/2. For these two to be perpendicular, θ/2 + (180 - θ)/2 = 90 degrees. Which simplifies to (θ + 180 - θ)/2 = 90 → 180/2 = 90. So, regardless of θ, the internal and external bisectors are always perpendicular? Wait, that can't be. Wait, no. Wait, the internal and external angle bisectors are perpendicular to each other if and only if the angle is 90 degrees. Because the angle between the internal and external bisectors is (θ/2) + ((180 - θ)/2) = 90 degrees. So, regardless of θ, they are always perpendicular. Wait, this suggests that for any angle, the internal and external bisectors are perpendicular. But that contradicts my earlier understanding. Wait, let me think.

No, the internal angle bisector and external angle bisector are perpendicular only if the original angle is 90 degrees? No, the calculation shows that they are always perpendicular. Because the angle between the internal and external bisectors is θ/2 + (180 - θ)/2 = 90 degrees. So, regardless of θ, the internal and external angle bisectors are perpendicular. Therefore, my earlier assumption that ABC is a right triangle at B was incorrect, because even if angle B is not right, the internal and external bisectors are still perpendicular. So, the presence of the right angle at G,B,F is due to BG and BF being the internal and external bisectors, which are always perpendicular. Therefore, angle B can be any angle, and the internal and external bisectors are perpendicular.

So, returning to the problem, we cannot assume that ABC is a right triangle
