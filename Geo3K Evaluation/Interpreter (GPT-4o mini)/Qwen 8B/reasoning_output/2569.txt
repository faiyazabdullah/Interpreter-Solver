Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out everything given.

We have a circle D. There are two arcs mentioned: Arc(F, E, H) and Arc(A, G, I). Also, there are lines that are radii of circle D: Line(D,F) and Line(D,B). Additionally, Line(F,B) and Line(A,G) are chords of circle D. Points F, G, H, I lie on circle D. 

Angles given are MeasureOf(Angle(H,A,I)) equals 110 degrees, and MeasureOf(Angle(G,B,I)) equals 150 degrees. The question asks for angle 5, but since the options are A-D, I need to figure out which angle corresponds to angle 5 here.

Wait, maybe angle 5 refers to one of these given angles? Or perhaps another angle formed by intersecting lines? Let me try to visualize the diagram based on the predicates.

First, circle D has points F, G, H, I on it. Lines DF and DB are radii, so points F and B are on the circle. Then, line FB is a chord of the circle. Similarly, line AG is a chord, with points A and G on the circle. Wait, but point A isn't mentioned as being on the circle yet. Wait, the arc Arc(A, G, I) suggests that points A, G, I are part of the circle. But the predicate says PointLiesOnCircle for points F, G, H, I. So point A isn't necessarily on the circle? Hmm, but if there's an arc starting at A, then maybe A is also on the circle? Wait, the arc Arc(A, G, I) would imply that A, G, I are points on the circle. Wait, but the predicate only mentions PointLiesOnCircle for F, G, H, I. Maybe there's a typo or maybe point A is also on the circle? Or perhaps the arc is part of another circle? Wait, the problem states that Arc(F,E,H) and Arc(A,G,I) are arcs. Since the first arc is part of circle D (since the first arc is Arc(F,E,H), and the second is Arc(A,G,I). Wait, but the circle is named D. Are those arcs parts of circle D?

Wait, the problem says "Arc(F, E, H)" and "Arc(A, G, I)". These could be arcs of circle D because points F, E, H are mentioned in relation to circle D. But wait, the only points explicitly stated to lie on circle D are F, G, H, I. So points E and A may not be on circle D? Or maybe they are? This is confusing. Let me re-examine the given predicates.

Given predicates:

- Circle(D)
- Arc(F, E, H)
- Arc(A, G, I)
- IsRadiusOf(Line(D,F), Circle(D)) → So DF is a radius, hence F is on circle D.
- IsRadiusOf(Line(D,B), Circle(D)) → DB is a radius, so B is on circle D.
- IsChordOf(Line(F,B), Circle(D)) → FB is a chord, so F and B are endpoints of a chord, which they are since they're on the circle.
- IsChordOf(Line(A,G), Circle(D)) → AG is a chord, so A and G are on the circle. Therefore, points A and G are on circle D. So earlier mention of point A being part of arc Arc(A, G, I) implies that A is on circle D. So points A, G, I are on circle D. Similarly, arc F, E, H—so points F, E, H are on circle D. But the initial PointLiesOnCircle only lists F, G, H, I. So maybe E is another point on the circle? Or maybe there's a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps E is a typo and should be another point? Maybe E is a point on the circle? For example, the arc from F to E to H would mean that E is another point on the circle. Similarly, the arc from A to G to I would imply that I is connected via G. 

So assuming that points E and A are on the circle. Let me proceed with that assumption. Now, we have several points on circle D: F, B, G, A, H, I, and possibly E. 

Now, angles given: Angle(HAI) measures 110°, and Angle(GBI) measures 150°. Wait, the angle measure for Angle(H,A,I) is 110°, and Angle(G,B,I) is 150°. So, angle at point A between points H and I is 110°, and angle at point B between points G and I is 150°. 

But how do these angles relate to each other? Let me think about the circle. Since points H and I are on the circle, and A is also on the circle, then angle HAI is an inscribed angle. Similarly, angle GBI is an inscribed angle. 

Inscribed angles subtend arcs. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its subtended arc. So angle HAI subtends arc HI, and angle GBI subtends arc GI. 

Let me write down the arcs:

For angle HAI: It's at point A, with segments AH and AI. So the arc it subtends is arc HI. So measure of angle HAI = ½(arc HI). Given that angle HAI is 110°, so arc HI would be 220°. But wait, arcs in a circle can't exceed 360°, but 220° is possible. However, in standard cases, inscribed angles typically subtend arcs less than 180°, but depending on where the angle is located, it could be major arcs. 

Similarly, angle GBI is at point B, with segments BG and BI. So it subtends arc GI. So measure of angle GBI is ½(arc GI). Given that angle GBI is 150°, so arc GI is 300°, which seems very large. But again, if it's a major arc, that's possible. 

But let me check if these arcs make sense. However, if arc HI is 220°, then the remaining arc would be 140°, since total circumference is 360°. Similarly, arc GI is 300°, leaving 60°. But I'm not sure yet. 

Alternatively, maybe the angles are referring to different arcs. Wait, inscribed angles can sometimes refer to the minor arc or major arc depending on the position of the points. For example, if the angle is formed outside the arc, it might subtend the opposite arc. 

But let's consider that angle HAI is formed by points H, A, I. Since all three points are on the circle, the angle is an inscribed angle. The arc that it intercepts would be the arc HI that does not contain point A. So if the angle is 110°, then arc HI is 220°, making it a major arc. Similarly, angle GBI intercepts arc GI that doesn't contain point B, which would be 300°, implying that arc GI is 300°, which is a major arc. 

But then, considering that these arcs are parts of the circle, perhaps there are overlapping arcs or relations between them. 

Additionally, since points A and G are on the circle, and AG is a chord. Also, points F and B are on the circle with chord FB. 

Now, looking for angle 5. The question is to find angle 5, but since the answer choices are A-D, and the given angles are 110° and 150°, perhaps angle 5 refers to another angle formed by intersecting chords or something else. 

Wait, maybe angle 5 is the angle formed at point I between some lines? Or maybe it's an angle formed by intersecting chords inside the circle? Let me think about possible configurations. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 5 refers to the angle between two chords intersecting at a certain point. Let's see. 

Another thought: Since angle HAI is 110°, which is an inscribed angle over arc HI (major arc HI = 220°). Similarly, angle GBI is 150°, which is over arc GI (major arc GI = 300°). 

But if we can find the relationship between these arcs, maybe we can find other angles. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to use the fact that the sum of arcs around the circle is 360°. 

Let me attempt to compute the arcs. 

From angle HAI = 110°, so arc HI = 220°. From angle GBI = 150°, so arc GI = 300°. But these arcs are parts of the circle. However, if arc HI is 220°, then the rest of the circle (arc HFI?) would be 140°, but I need to clarify the exact arcs. 

Wait, but arc HI could be either major or minor. Suppose that arc HI is the minor arc, then it would be 2*110=220°, but that's impossible because minor arcs are less than 180°. Hence, it must be the major arc HI, which is 220°, so the minor arc HI would be 360 - 220 = 140°. Similarly, for arc GI, if the angle is 150°, then the intercepted arc is 300°, which would be the major arc GI, so the minor arc GI is 60°. 

Therefore, minor arc HI is 140°, minor arc GI is 60°. 

Now, let's think about how these arcs relate. Since points A, G, I are on the circle, and AG is a chord. Also, points F, B are on the circle with chord FB. 

Perhaps there's a way to connect these arcs. For instance, if we can find the measure of arc FG or something else. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 5 refers to the angle formed by intersecting chords at point I. For example, if two chords intersect at I, creating vertical angles. 

Wait, but without knowing exactly where point I is, it's hard to tell. However, since we know arc GI is 60° (minor) and arc HI is 140°, perhaps we can find other arcs. 

Alternatively, let's consider the positions of the points. Let me try to imagine the circle with points F, B, A, G, H, I. 

Since AG is a chord, and GI is a chord. Also, HI is an arc. 

Alternatively, maybe there's an intersection of chords at point I. For instance, if chords FI and AI intersect at some point, but I don't have enough info. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 5 is the angle between chords that form a triangle with known angles. 

Wait, perhaps angle 5 refers to the angle at point I between points H and G? Let me check. 

If we consider the angle at point I between points H and G, that would be angle HIG. But how would that relate to the given angles? 

Alternatively, maybe angle 5 is the angle between chords FI and BI, or something like that. 

Alternatively, since we have two angles given, maybe we can find other angles using the properties of circles. 

Let me recall that the sum of the measures of arcs around a circle is 360°. So if I can find the measures of arcs HI and GI, then maybe other arcs can be found. 

Earlier, we deduced that minor arc HI is 140°, and minor arc GI is 60°. 

Assuming that, then let's look for relationships. 

Suppose that arc GI is 60°, so the central angle for that arc is 60°, and the inscribed angle over that arc would be 30°. But we have angle GBI as 150°, which was over the major arc GI. 

Now, maybe there's a way to find other arcs. For example, if we can find the arc from G to H, or other connections. 

Alternatively, since points A and G are connected by a chord AG, and points A and I are connected by a chord AI. Also, points H and I are connected by a chord HI. 

Let me think about triangle AHI. In triangle AHI, angle at A is 110°, and sides AH and AI are chords of the circle. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a cyclic quadrilateral involved. 

Alternatively, since points A, G, I are on the circle, and points F, B are on the circle, perhaps there are intersecting chords or secants that form angles. 

Wait, another idea: The angle between two chords intersecting at a point on the circle. For example, if two chords intersect at a point on the circle, the angle formed is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc. 

Alternatively, if two chords intersect inside the circle, the measure of the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. 

But in our case, the given angles are inscribed angles. 

Wait, but angle GBI is at point B, which is on the circle. So that's an inscribed angle. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to find the measure of angle 5 by combining these arcs. 

Wait, perhaps angle 5 is the angle formed by the intersection of chords FI and BI? Or another pair. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 5 refers to the angle at point I between points G and H, which would be angle GIH. Let's explore that. 

Angle GIH would be an inscribed angle subtending arc GH. To find its measure, we need to know the measure of arc GH. 

How can we find arc GH? 

Well, let's see. We have arc GI as 60° (minor) and arc HI as 140° (minor). Assuming that points G, I, H are arranged in order on the circle, then arc GI + arc IH = arc GH. Wait, but arc GI is 60°, and arc IH would depend on the arrangement. 

Wait, if we consider the circle with points G, I, H. Let me assume that the arc from G to I is 60°, and the arc from I to H is... Well, earlier, arc HI (minor) is 140°, so arc from H to I is 140°, which would mean that arc from I to H is 140°, going the other way. 

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to map out the arcs. 

Let me denote the circle with points A, B, F, G, H, I. 

We know that arc GI is 60° (minor). So from point G to point I along the minor arc is 60°. 

Also, arc HI is 140° (minor), so from H to I is 140°. 

Assuming that the points are ordered such that moving from G to I is 60°, and from H to I is 140°, then the arc from G to H would be arc GI + arc IH? No, if we go from G to I (60°) and then from I to H (140°), that would be the entire arc from G to H passing through I. But that depends on the direction. 

Alternatively, if the arc from G to H goes the other way around the circle, then the measure would be 360° minus (arc GI + arc IH). 

But without knowing the exact positions, it's challenging. However, maybe there's another way. 

Let me think about the entire circle. The total circumference is 360°. 

We have arc GI as 60°, arc HI as 140°, but these arcs overlap or not? 

Alternatively, if we consider that points G, I, H are connected, and we have arc GI = 60°, arc IH = 140°, then arc GH would be arc GI + arc IH if they are adjacent. But if they are not adjacent, it's unclear. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another arc that connects to these. 

Let me consider that points A, G, I are on the circle, forming an arc AGI. Since AG is a chord, and arc from A to G to I. If the arc AGI is made up of arc AG and arc GI. But we know arc GI is 60°, but arc AG is unknown. 

Alternatively, since angle at A is 110°, which is an inscribed angle over arc HI. So arc HI is 220°, which is the major arc. So the minor arc HI is 140°, as before. 

Now, suppose we want to find angle 5. Maybe angle 5 is the angle at point I between points G and H, which is angle GIH. As mentioned earlier, that would be an inscribed angle subtending arc GH. 

To find arc GH, we need to subtract other arcs from 360°. 

If arc GI is 60°, arc HI is 140°, then arc GH could be arc GI + arc IH, but if they are adjacent. Wait, if arc GI is 60°, and arc IH is 140°, then arc GH would be arc GI plus arc IH if they are next to each other. But that would be 60 + 140 = 200°, which would make angle GIH = 1/2 * 200 = 100°. But none of the answer choices are 100°, so that might not be correct. 

Alternatively, maybe arc GH is the remaining arc. Let me calculate the total. 

Total circle is 360°. Suppose arc GI is 60°, arc HI is 140°, then the rest of the circle is 360 - 60 - 140 = 160°. That 160° would consist of other arcs. 

But without more information, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, let's consider the other given angle, angle GBI = 150°, which subtends arc GI (major arc). Wait, earlier calculation said that the major arc GI is 300°, so the minor arc GI is 60°, as before. 

Now, if we can find another arc, maybe involving point B. 

Point B is on the circle, and DF and DB are radii. So point B is another endpoint of a radius. Let me think about the location of point B. Since DF and DB are radii, points F and B are both on the circle. 

So, chord FB connects points F and B. 

Maybe there's a relationship between arcs involving points F and B. 

But I still don't see a clear connection to angle 5. 

Wait, maybe angle 5 refers to the angle formed by intersecting chords at point I. For instance, if chords FI and BI intersect at point I, but that's just a single point. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 5 is the external angle formed by extending some chords. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 5 is the angle between chords FI and AI, or something like that. 

Alternatively, since the problem includes arcs Arc(F, E, H) and Arc(A, G, I), maybe there's an intersection of these arcs leading to certain angles. 

Wait, arc Arc(F, E, H) suggests that points F, E, H are on the circle, forming an arc from F to H passing through E. Similarly, arc Arc(A, G, I) suggests points A, G, I on the circle. 

If we consider that arc FEH is part of the circle, then E is a point between F and H on the circle. 

But since we don't have information about point E, it's difficult to incorporate. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle or quadrilateral involving points F, B, G, I, etc., where angle 5 is part of. 

Let me think about the angles given. We have angle HAI = 110°, angle GBI = 150°. Perhaps there's a way to find another angle using the sum of angles in a triangle or something. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 5 is supplementary to one of these angles. 

Wait, if I consider that the sum of the angles around point I. For example, if there are multiple angles meeting at point I, their sum would be 360°. 

But without knowing which angles, this is speculative. 

Another approach: Since angle HAI is 110°, which is an inscribed angle over arc HI (major arc), and angle GBI is 150°, over arc GI (major arc). Let me try to find the measure of arc FG or another arc that connects to these. 

Alternatively, since points F and B are endpoints of radii, maybe there's a symmetry or equidistant points. 

Wait, DF and DB are radii of the same circle, so points F and B are both on the circle, and the center is D. So, the distance from D to F and D to B is the same. 

This means that triangle DFB is an isosceles triangle with DF=DB. 

But how does that help us? 

If we can find the measure of angle FDB, which is the central angle corresponding to arc FB. 

But we don't have direct information about arc FB. 

However, if we can relate it to other arcs. 

Alternatively, since we have points A, G, I on the circle, and AG is a chord. 

Let me try to consider the arcs again. 

If arc GI is 60°, and arc HI is 140°, and assuming that point A is somewhere on the circle, maybe connecting these arcs. 

Let me try to imagine the circle with points G, I, H, A, F, B. 

If I can find the measure of arc FA or arc AB, but I don't have enough data. 

Wait, but maybe there's an intersection of chords at point I. For example, if chords FI and GI intersect at point I. Wait, but that's trivial. 

Alternatively, if there are two chords intersecting inside the circle, creating vertical angles. For instance, if chords FI and BI intersect at some point inside the circle, creating angles. 

But without knowing where the intersection is, this is hard. 

Wait, let me consider that angle 5 is the angle between chords FI and BI. Let's call that angle x. 

If I can find x using the arcs. 

The formula for the angle formed by two chords intersecting inside a circle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. 

So, if angle x is formed by chords FI and BI intersecting at some point inside the circle, then x = ½ (arc FB + arc ...). 

But I don't know where the intersection is. 

Alternatively, if the angle is at point I, formed by chords IG and IH, which would be angle GIH, which we discussed earlier. 

If angle GIH is the angle we're seeking, then it's an inscribed angle subtending arc GH. 

As previously, if we can find arc GH, then angle GIH = ½ arc GH. 

To find arc GH, we need to consider the total circumference. 

We know arc GI is 60°, arc HI is 140°, and assuming that arc GH is part of the circle. 

But how? Let's assume that the points are ordered as G, I, H, and then others. 

If arc GI is 60°, and arc IH is 140°, then the arc from G to H passing through I is 60+140=200°, which would mean that the minor arc GH is 200°? No, because minor arcs are less than 180°. So this suggests that the arc GH is actually the major arc, and the minor arc GH would be 360 - 200 = 160°. 

Thus, angle GIH, which subtends arc GH, would be ½ of the arc GH. But which arc? If the angle is at point I, then it subtends the arc that doesn't contain point I. 

Wait, inscribed angle at point I subtending arc GH would be the arc that doesn't include point I. So if the arc GH is the major arc (200°), then the inscribed angle would be half of that, which is 100°, but this is not among the answer choices. 

Alternatively, if arc GH is the minor arc of 160°, then the inscribed angle would be 80°, also not matching. 

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe my assumptions about the arcs are incorrect. 

Let me revisit the earlier step. When I assumed that angle HAI (at point A) subtends arc HI, which gave me arc HI as 220°, but that led to minor arc HI being 140°. However, if arc HI is 220°, then the arc from H to I passing through the other side of the circle is 220°, while the arc from H to I passing through the other side is 140°. 

So, if we consider the minor arc HI is 140°, then the major arc HI is 220°. 

Similarly, for angle GBI (at point B) subtending arc GI, giving major arc GI as 300°, so minor arc GI is 60°. 

Now, if we consider the entire circle, the sum of all arcs should be 360°. 

Let me try to find the measure of arc GH. 

Assume that points G, I, H are on the circle. We know arc GI is 60° (minor), and arc HI is 140° (minor). 

If these arcs are adjacent, then the arc from G to H passing through I would be arc GI + arc IH = 60 + 140 = 200°, which is major arc GH. Thus, the minor arc GH would be 360 - 200 = 160°. 

So, if angle GIH is an inscribed angle subtending arc GH, it would be half of the arc that it intercepts. Since angle GIH is at point I, it would intercept arc GH that does not contain point I. 

So, if arc GH is 160°, then angle GIH is 80°. But this is not one of the answer choices. 

Alternatively, if angle GIH subtends the major arc GH (200°), then it would be 100°, still not matching. 

This suggests that my previous assumption about the arcs might be wrong. 

Wait, maybe the arc subtended by angle HAI is not HI but something else. Let me double-check. 

Angle HAI is at point A, between points H and I. So, the inscribed angle at A intercepts the arc HI that does not pass through A. So, if the arc HI is the one that does not contain A, which would be the major arc HI (220°), then the inscribed angle is half that, which is 110°, matching the given value. 

Similarly, angle GBI is at point B, between points G and I, so it intercepts arc GI not containing B. If that arc is major arc GI (300°), then the inscribed angle is 150°, which matches. 

So, major arc HI is 220°, major arc GI is 300°. 

Now, let's consider the arc from G to H. 

If we can find the measure of arc GH, we can find angle GIH. 

To find arc GH, note that the total circumference is 360°. 

If we can express arc GH in terms of other arcs. 

Let me consider the arc from G to I is 300° (major arc), and arc from I to H is 220° (major arc). Wait, no, arc HI is 220°, but arc GI is 300°. 

Wait, this seems conflicting. Let me try to draw this mentally. 

Imagine the circle with points G and I such that the major arc GI is 300°, so the minor arc GI is 60°. Then, the major arc HI is 220°, so the minor arc HI is 140°. 

Now, to find arc GH, we need to see how these arcs connect. 

If we take the major arc GI (300°), and the major arc HI (220°), but these arcs are separate. 

Alternatively, maybe we can find the arc from G to H by adding or subtracting other arcs. 

Let me think: Starting from point G, going through I to H, the arc GI is 300°, and arc IH is 220°? No, that doesn't make sense because arc IH is part of the circle. 

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the arc from G to H passes through I. So, arc GH passing through I is arc GI + arc IH. 

But arc GI is 300° (major), and arc IH is 220° (major)? That would give a huge arc, exceeding 360°, which is impossible. 

Clearly, there's confusion here. Let me try a different approach. 

Since major arc GI is 300°, then the minor arc GI is 60°. Major arc HI is 220°, so minor arc HI is 140°. 

Let me consider the entire circle. 

If we add up the minor arcs GI (60°), HI (140°), and any other arcs. 

But without knowing the exact positions of all points, it's tough. 

Alternatively, since points A, G, I are on the circle, and angle at A is 110°, which is half the major arc HI. 

Let me consider that the arc from H to I is 220°, so the arc from I to H is 220°, which means the arc from H to I going the other way is 140°. 

Similarly, arc from G to I is 300°, so the arc from I to G going the other way is 60°. 

Now, if we consider the arc from G to H, it could be the sum of arc from G to I (60°) and arc from I to H (140°), totaling 200°, which would be the major arc GH. So the minor arc GH would be 360 - 200 = 160°. 

Thus, the inscribed angle subtending minor arc GH would be 80°, and the one subtending major arc GH would be 100°. 

But how does this help us? 

If angle GIH is an inscribed angle subtending arc GH, it depends on which arc it subtends. 

If point I is not on arc GH, then the angle at I would subtend arc GH. 

But since points G and H are on the circle, and I is also on the circle, the arc GH that does not include I would be the arc that goes the other way around the circle. 

So, if arc GH is 160° (minor), then angle GIH would be half of that, 80°. 

But this is not among the answer choices. 

Alternatively, if the angle subtends the major arc GH (200°), then it would be 100°, still not matching. 

Hmm, this suggests that perhaps angle 5 is not angle GIH. 

Wait, maybe angle 5 refers to another angle. Let's think about the given angles and possible relationships. 

We have two angles: 110° and 150°. Their sum is 260°, and their difference is 40°. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 5 is the difference between these two angles, or some combination. 

Alternatively, since the sum of angles around a point is 360°, if there are multiple angles meeting at a point. 

Wait, if we consider point I, where angle GBI and angle HAI are given, maybe there are other angles at point I. 

At point I, there are likely multiple angles. For example, angle GIB, angle HIA, etc. 

Alternatively, if there's a triangle involving points G, I, and another point. 

Wait, let me think about the triangle formed by points G, I, and B. 

In triangle GIB, we know angle at B is 150°, and maybe other angles can be found. 

But without knowing other sides or angles, this is difficult. 

Alternatively, since points G and I are on the circle, and B is also on the circle, triangle GIB is inscribed in the circle. 

The angle at B is 150°, so the arc GI is 300° (as before). 

Then, the other angles in the triangle would be related to other arcs. 

For example, angle at G would be half the arc IB, and angle at I would be half the arc GB. 

But without knowing arc IB or arc GB, it's hard to calculate. 

Let me try. 

In triangle GIB, angle at B is 150°, so the arc opposite to it, which is arc GI, is 300°. 

The sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, so the other two angles sum to 30°. 

If I can find one of them, I can find the other. 

For example, angle at G is half the arc IB. Let's say arc IB is x, then angle at G is x/2. Similarly, angle at I is half the arc GB, say y/2. 

So, x/2 + y/2 + 150° = 180° => x + y = 60°. 

But without more info, I cannot determine x and y. 

Same issue applies to triangle HIA, where angle at A is 110°, so arc HI is 220°, and the other angles would relate to other arcs. 

This seems unproductive. 

Maybe I need to consider the possibility that angle 5 is the exterior angle formed by extending some chords. 

For example, if there's a tangent or something. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 5 is the supplement of one of the given angles. 

For instance, 180° - 150° = 30°, or 180° - 110° = 70°. Neither of these are in the options. 

Wait, the answer choices are 50, 110, 130, 150. 

Wait, maybe angle 5 is the difference between the two given angles: 150° - 110° = 40°, but that's not an option. 

Or maybe the average? (150 + 110)/2 = 130°, which is option C. 

That's a possibility. 

Why would it be 130°? Let me think. 

If there's a scenario where angle 5 is the sum or difference of the given angles, or some combination. 

Alternatively, maybe it's the supplement of one of the given angles. 

Wait, 180° - 150° = 30°, not helpful. 

Wait, if there's an inscribed angle that is the average of the two given angles, but why? 

Alternatively, maybe angle 5 is the angle formed by two chords intersecting inside the circle, where the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. 

Let me try this. Suppose there are two chords intersecting at point I, and angle 5 is formed by those chords. 

For example, if chords FI and BI intersect at some point inside the circle, creating an angle. 

But without knowing which arcs are intercepted, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, if angle 5 is formed by the intersection of chords FG and BI at some point. 

But again, lack of information. 

Wait, another idea: Since we have two angles, 110° and 150°, and the answer choices include 130°, which is halfway between 110 and 150. Maybe there's a scenario where angle 5 is the average of these two, or some function thereof. 

Alternatively, if angle 5 is the supplement of the difference between the two angles. 

150° - 110° = 40°, supplement is 140°, not in options. 

Alternatively, if angle 5 is the complement of the difference: 90° - 40° = 50°, which is option A. 

But this is too much speculation. 

Wait, let me try to think differently. 

Since the two given angles are 110° and 150°, and the answer choices are 50, 110, 130, 150. 

If angle 5 is the third angle in a triangle where the other two angles are 110° and 150°, but that's impossible because the sum would exceed 180°. 

Alternatively, if angle 5 is part of a cyclic quadrilateral. 

In a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles sum to 180°. If angle 5 is opposite to one of the given angles, then 180° - 150° = 30°, or 180° - 110° = 70°, neither of which are options. 

Alternatively, if angle 5 is an external angle to a triangle, which is equal to the sum of the remote interior angles. 

But without knowing which triangle, this is guesswork. 

Wait, let me return to the arc measures. 

Earlier, I had arc GI = 60° (minor), arc HI = 140° (minor). 

If I can find the measure of arc FG or arc FB, perhaps I can find other angles. 

Since DF and DB are radii, points F and B are on the circle. So, the arc from F to B is the arc FB. 

But how to find its measure? 

If I can relate it to other arcs. 

Assume that points F, B, G, H, I are arranged on the circle. 

Let me try to imagine the circle with points F, B, G, H, I, A. 

Let me try to find the measure of arc FB. 

If I can find it, then maybe I can find other arcs. 

But I don't have direct information about arc FB. 

Wait, but if I consider that point A is on the circle, and AG is a chord. 

If I can find the measure of arc AG, which would be related to angle at H or something. 

Alternatively, since angle at A is 110°, which is half the arc HI (major arc), and angle at B is 150°, half of arc GI (major arc). 

Now, if I consider the arc from G to H, which we previously thought might be 160°, and if there's a relationship between arc FG and arc FB. 

This is getting too abstract. Maybe I need to consider that angle 5 is 130°, which is 180° - 50°, and 50° is half of 100°, but I don't know. 

Alternatively, since the given angles are 110° and 150°, and the answer choices include 130°, which is 180° - 50°, and 50° is half of 100°, which might be related to arc measures. 

Wait, if I assume that angle 5 is 130°, which is the supplement of 50°, and 50° could be half of 100°, which might be an arc measure. 

But without concrete reasoning, this is just guessing. 

Alternatively, let me consider that angle 5 is the angle formed by the intersection of two chords at point I. 

For example, if chords FI and BI intersect at point I, but that's just a single point. 

Alternatively, if there are two chords intersecting at point I, like FI and HI, but that would form angle FIH, which is part of the given angles. 

Wait, angle at I between F and H would be angle FIH. 

But how to find that? 

It would be an inscribed angle subtending arc FH. 

If I can find arc FH, then angle FIH = ½ arc FH. 

But how to find arc FH? 

If I can express arc FH in terms of other arcs. 

Let me try. 

We have arc GI = 60°, arc HI = 140°, and arc from G to I is 60°, arc from H to I is 140°. 

If I can find arc from F to G, or something else. 

But I don't have information about arc FG. 

Wait, but points F and B are on the circle, with DF and DB as radii. So, the arc from F to B is the arc FB. 

If I can find arc FB, then maybe combine it with other arcs. 

But how? 

Let me think about the total circle. 

If I add up all the arcs I know: arc GI = 60°, arc HI = 140°, and assume arc FB is x. 

But without knowing how these arcs relate, it's still unclear. 

I'm stuck. Let me try to think of the answer choices. 

The options are 50, 110, 130, 150. 

Given that one of the given angles is 150°, and another is 110°, and the answer is likely to be related to their difference or sum. 

150 - 110 = 40, not in options. 

110 + 150 = 260, not in options. 

But if I consider that the sum of the two given angles is 260°, and the remaining angle in some context is 100°, but that's not in options. 

Wait, but if there's a triangle where the sum of angles is 180°, and one angle is 150°, then the other two sum to 30°, but not helpful. 

Alternatively, if angle 5 is the supplement of one of the given angles, like 180 - 150 = 30°, not in options. 

Wait, but maybe it's the supplement of the difference between the two angles? 180 - (150 - 110) = 140°, not in options. 

Alternatively, 180 - 110 = 70°, not in options. 

Hmm. 

Wait, let me try to think about the possibility that angle 5 is 130°, which is the supplement of 50°. And 50° could be half of 100°, which might be an arc measure. 

But how? 

Let me assume that angle 5 is 130°, and see if it fits with the given data. 

If angle 5 is 130°, it could be an inscribed angle subtending an arc of 260°, which is a major arc. 

But how would that relate to the given arcs? 

Alternatively, if there's an inscribed angle of 130°, it would subtend an arc of 260°, which is possible. 

But how to get there from the given information? 

Alternatively, if there's an angle formed by two intersecting chords, where the angle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs. 

For example, if two chords intersect inside the circle, forming an angle of 130°, then the sum of the intercepted arcs would be 260°. 

But without knowing which arcs, it's hard to say. 

But if the given arcs are 60° and 200°, their sum is 260°, which would give an angle of 130°. 

Ah! If there are two arcs whose measures add up to 260°, then the angle formed by intersecting chords would be 130°. 

Let me check: 

If arc GI is 60° (minor), and arc HI is 220° (major), then their sum is 60 + 220 = 280°, which is not 260. 

If arc GI is 60°, and arc HI is 200°, then sum is 260°. 

But where does 200° come from? 

If arc HI is 200°, then the minor arc HI would be 160°, but earlier calculations suggested it was 140°. 

This is inconsistent. 

But if I assume that
