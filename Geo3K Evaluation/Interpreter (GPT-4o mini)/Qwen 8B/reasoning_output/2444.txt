<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have several predicates given, and we need to find the value of x, which is part of the sum with y equal to 90. Let me start by breaking down each predicate and see how they connect.

First, the given predicates:

1. RightAngle(Angle(B,D,C)): This means that angle at point D between points B, D, and C is a right angle. So triangle BDC is a right triangle with the right angle at D.

Wait, but wait. Wait, Angle(B,D,C) would mean the angle at point D formed by points B, D, C. So BD and DC form the legs of a right angle at D. Hmm. But I need to visualize this. Maybe there's a diagram implied here, but since it's not provided, I'll have to reconstruct based on other info.

Next, Isosceles(Triangle(C,A,D)). So triangle CAD is isosceles. That means two sides are equal. Also, the next predicate says Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,D)), LengthOf(Line(A,C))). So AD equals AC. Therefore, in triangle ACD, sides AD and AC are equal. Hence, triangle ACD is isosceles with base CD and equal sides AD and AC. Therefore, the base angles at C and D should be equal? Wait, no. In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are equal. Since AD = AC, then angles opposite them would be angle at C (opposite AD) and angle at D (opposite AC). Wait, no. Let me clarify:

In triangle ACD, if AD = AC, then the sides AD and AC are equal. So vertex A is connected to D and C. So the triangle has vertices A, C, D. Sides: AC, AD, and CD. If AC = AD, then the two equal sides are AC and AD, so the base is CD. Then the base angles would be angles at C and D. Wait, angle at C is opposite AD, and angle at D is opposite AC. Since AC = AD, those angles are equal. So angle at C equals angle at D in triangle ACD.

But also, we have another right angle involving points B, D, C. So maybe these triangles are connected?

Then, Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)),40): BC = 40 units.

Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,B)),22): DB = 22 units.

And Equals(SumOf(x,y),90): So x + y = 90. We need to find x. But what are x and y? The problem doesn't specify, but perhaps they refer to some angles or lengths? Wait, the question is to find x, and the sum with y is 90. Maybe x and y are angles? Or could be parts of a triangle?

Alternatively, maybe x and y are lengths. For example, if there's a triangle where one side is x and another is y, adding up to 90. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, looking back at the answer choices, they are numerical values like 37.2, etc., suggesting x is likely a length or an angle measure. Given that some lengths are given as 40 and 22, and others are variables, perhaps x is an angle measure, and y is another angle, adding up to 90 degrees? Because sometimes in problems, supplementary or complementary angles add up to certain measures.

But let's think again. Let me try to map out the points and connections.

We have points A, B, C, D involved. From the first predicate, angle at D (BDC) is a right angle. So triangle BDC is right-angled at D. Then, triangle ACD is isosceles with AD=AC. Also, BC = 40, BD = 22.

So maybe we can draw triangle BDC first. Let me sketch mentally:

Points B, D, C. Right angle at D. So BD and DC are perpendicular. BD is 22, BC is 40. Wait, BD is 22, BC is 40. Wait, but BC is the hypotenuse of triangle BDC? Because in right triangle BDC, BD and DC are legs, and BC is the hypotenuse. So according to Pythagoras:

BD² + DC² = BC²

Plugging numbers:

22² + DC² = 40² → 484 + DC² = 1600 → DC² = 1600 - 484 = 1116 → DC = sqrt(1116). Let me compute sqrt(1116). Well, sqrt(1116) ≈ sqrt(1156)=34, so sqrt(1116) ≈ 33.4... Wait, 33^2=1089, 34^2=1156. So 1116-1089=27. So approx 33 + 27/(2*33) ≈ 33 + 0.409 ≈ 33.409. So DC ≈ 33.41 units.

Now, considering triangle ACD is isosceles with AD = AC. So AD = AC. Also, point A is connected to D and C. So A is somewhere such that AD = AC. Let me think about coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to points would help.

Let me place point D at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since triangle BDC is right-angled at D, let me set coordinates:

Point D: (0, 0)

Since BD is 22, and assuming BD is along the x-axis, then point B would be at (22, 0). Point C is connected to D, forming DC. Earlier calculation gave DC ≈ 33.41, but let me keep it symbolic for now. Since triangle BDC is right-angled at D, coordinates of C would be (0, DC), because DC is vertical from D (if BD is horizontal). Wait, if D is at (0,0), and BD is along x-axis from D(0,0) to B(22,0). Then DC is vertical upwards from D(0,0) to C(0, DC_length). Then BC connects B(22,0) to C(0, DC_length), and its length is 40.

So coordinates:

B: (22, 0)

D: (0, 0)

C: (0, c), where c = DC = sqrt(40² - 22²) = sqrt(1600 - 484) = sqrt(1116) ≈ 33.409.

Now, point A is such that triangle ACD is isosceles with AD = AC. So AD = AC. Let me denote coordinates for A as (x, y). Then distance from A to D (which is (0,0)) is sqrt((x)^2 + (y)^2).

Distance from A to C (which is (0, c)) is sqrt((x - 0)^2 + (y - c)^2) = sqrt(x² + (y - c)^2).

Setting these equal:

sqrt(x² + y²) = sqrt(x² + (y - c)^2)

Square both sides:

x² + y² = x² + (y - c)^2 → y² = y² - 2cy + c² → 0 = -2cy + c² → 2cy = c² → y = c/2.

Therefore, the y-coordinate of point A is half of c, i.e., c/2. So regardless of x, as long as AD = AC, point A lies on the horizontal line y = c/2. Wait, but that seems too general. Wait, this suggests that for any point A lying on the horizontal line passing through midpoint of DC? Wait, because DC is vertical from (0,0) to (0,c). Its midpoint is at (0, c/2). But our calculation shows that point A must lie on the horizontal line y = c/2, which is horizontal line passing through the midpoint of DC. Wait, but that's only if we consider the condition AD = AC. So point A lies somewhere on that horizontal line. But there's more constraints? Are there other conditions?

Also, we have triangle ACD being isosceles with AD = AC, so point A is located such that it's equidistant from D and C. Which would be the perpendicular bisector of segment DC. But DC is vertical from (0,0) to (0,c). The perpendicular bisector would be horizontal line passing through midpoint of DC, which is (0, c/2). Wait, but the perpendicular bisector of a vertical segment is horizontal line through its midpoint. So yes, that's consistent. So point A lies anywhere on that horizontal line. But we need more info to fix its position.

But perhaps there's another relationship? Let me check the other given predicates. There's nothing else directly about point A except the isosceles triangle and the equality of AD and AC. Unless there's something else connecting point A to other points. Wait, the problem mentions triangle BDC and triangle ACD. So maybe point A is connected to B? Not sure yet.

Wait, but the problem didn't mention any other lines or points beyond B, C, D, A. So maybe we need to find relations between these points. Alternatively, maybe there's another right angle or other properties.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to relate the coordinates of A with other elements.

But we need to find x, which is part of SumOf(x,y)=90. Assuming x and y are angles, maybe? Or maybe lengths? Let me think.

Suppose x and y are angles. For instance, in triangle BDC, which is right-angled, angles at B and C add up to 90 degrees. But the sum here is 90. But the problem states SumOf(x,y)=90. Maybe x and y are angles that add up to 90, like complementary angles. But without knowing which angles, it's unclear.

Alternatively, x and y could be lengths. Suppose x is a length and y is another length, adding up to 90. But given that BC is 40, BD is 22, and DC is ~33.41, maybe x and y are parts of some triangle or something else.

Alternatively, maybe x and y are angles in a triangle, and their sum is 90. For example, if there's a triangle with angles x and y, and third angle being 90, making sum 180. But then x+y would be 90. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe x is an angle measure and y is another, such as in triangle ACD or elsewhere.

Alternatively, considering that there's a right angle at D, and triangle ACD is isosceles, perhaps leading to some angles that sum up to 90.

Let me try to explore angles. Let's look at triangle ACD. It's isosceles with AD=AC. So angles at C and D are equal. Let me call angle at C as θ, angle at D as θ, then angle at A is 180 - 2θ.

But also, angle at D in triangle ACD is adjacent to the right angle in triangle BDC. Wait, angle at D in triangle BDC is 90 degrees. But angle at D in triangle ACD is part of that same point D. So maybe the angle between DC and DA is θ, and the right angle at D involves BD and DC. So perhaps angle between BD and DA relates to θ?

Alternatively, maybe there's a larger triangle involving points A, B, C, D. For example, if we consider triangle ABC or ABD?

Alternatively, maybe triangle ABD? Let me think. If I can find coordinates for A, then I can calculate distances or angles.

Earlier, we found that point A lies on the horizontal line y = c/2, where c = DC ≈ 33.409. So y-coordinate of A is approximately 16.7045. Let's denote c = sqrt(1116) for exactness. So c = sqrt(40² - 22²) = sqrt(1600 - 484) = sqrt(1116) = sqrt(4*279) = 2*sqrt(279). But maybe keeping it symbolic is better.

So coordinates of A: (a, c/2), where 'a' is variable. Now, do we have any other constraints on point A? The problem hasn't mentioned anything else about A except the isosceles triangle and AD=AC. So unless there's another relation, we might need more info.

Wait, but maybe there's a connection between point A and point B? Like AB or something else? The problem doesn't state it explicitly, but maybe there's an implicit assumption. For example, maybe points A, B, C, D form a quadrilateral? Or maybe triangle ABC?

Alternatively, perhaps triangle ABD? Let me check if there's any missing information. The problem gives us BD = 22, BC = 40, DC = sqrt(1116). And AD = AC. 

Wait, but if we can express AC in terms of coordinates. Since AC is the distance from A(a, c/2) to C(0, c):

AC = sqrt[(a - 0)^2 + (c/2 - c)^2] = sqrt[a² + (-c/2)^2] = sqrt(a² + c²/4).

Similarly, AD is the distance from A(a, c/2) to D(0,0):

AD = sqrt[(a)^2 + (c/2)^2] = same as above. So indeed, AD = AC, which satisfies the isosceles condition. So this holds for any a. Thus, point A can be anywhere along the horizontal line y = c/2. But without more constraints, we can't determine a unique position for A. Therefore, there must be another relationship that determines the position of A.

Wait, but maybe there's another right angle or triangle involving A? For example, if there's a right angle at A or something else. But the only given right angle is at D in BDC. 

Wait, the initial problem statement may involve more than just the given predicates. Let me recheck the given predicates:

RightAngle(Angle(B,D,C)) – that's the right angle at D between B, D, C.

Isosceles(Triangle(C,A,D)) – triangle CAD is isosceles.

Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,D)),LengthOf(Line(A,C))) – AD = AC.

Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)),40) – BC = 40.

Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,B)),22) – DB = 22.

Equals(SumOf(x,y),90) – x + y = 90.

No other predicates. So perhaps there's another relationship that I'm missing. Maybe triangle ABC or ABD?

Alternatively, perhaps triangle ABD? Let me think. If I can find AB or something else.

Alternatively, maybe triangle ABD and triangle CBD share some properties. Or maybe there's a way to find the coordinates of A using other info.

Wait, but without more info about point A, it's impossible to determine its location. Unless there's an implicit assumption that A lies on BC or something. But that's not stated.

Wait, but maybe there's a way to relate angles. For example, if we consider triangle ADC, which is isosceles with AD=AC, and angle at D. Earlier, we had that in triangle ADC, angles at C and D are equal. Let me call them both α. Then angle at A is 180 - 2α.

But angle at D in triangle ADC is angle ADC. What's the measure of angle ADC?

In triangle ADC, angle at D is between DC and DA. But from earlier, in triangle BDC, angle at D is 90 degrees. So angle between BD and DC is 90 degrees. Now, angle between DA and DC is α. So if I can find the relationship between these angles.

Assuming that DA forms some angle with DC. But without knowing where A is, it's hard to say. However, since point A lies on y = c/2, which is horizontal line, and DC is vertical. So DC goes from D(0,0) to C(0,c). So direction of DC is straight up. DA goes from D(0,0) to A(a, c/2). So vector DA is (a, c/2). The angle between DA and DC (which is vertical) can be computed via dot product.

Vector DC is (0, c) - (0,0) = (0, c). Vector DA is (a, c/2). The angle between DA and DC is angle ADC in triangle ADC.

The cosine of angle ADC is (DA · DC)/(|DA| |DC|).

Compute DA · DC = (a)(0) + (c/2)(c) = c²/2.

|DA| = sqrt(a² + (c/2)^2) = sqrt(a² + c²/4).

|DC| = c.

Thus cos(angle ADC) = (c²/2) / [sqrt(a² + c²/4) * c] = [c/2] / sqrt(a² + c²/4).

But in triangle ADC, angle ADC is α, which is equal to angle at C (angle ACD). Also, angle ADC is adjacent to the right angle at D in triangle BDC. Wait, angle between DA and DC is α, and angle between BD and DC is 90 degrees. Depending on where A is, these angles might be related.

For example, if A is positioned such that DA extends in some direction relative to BD. But since DA is from D(0,0) to A(a, c/2), the direction depends on 'a'. If a is positive, A is to the right of D; if negative, left.

But without knowing 'a', we can't proceed numerically. However, maybe there's another constraint from the problem. Let me think again.

Wait, the question asks for x, where x + y = 90. Perhaps x and y are angles in some triangle or configuration. For example, suppose x is angle BAD and y is angle DAC, adding up to 90. Or some other pair.

Alternatively, maybe x and y are sides of a triangle. For example, if there's a triangle where two sides add up to 90. But without more info, it's challenging.

Alternatively, maybe x and y are the two non-right angles in a right triangle. For example, if there's a right triangle where x + y = 90 degrees.

Wait, but the only right angle given is at D in triangle BDC. Could there be another right angle involving point A?

Alternatively, since triangle ACD is isosceles with AD=AC, maybe there's a relationship between angles that could lead to x + y = 90.

Let me try to explore angles in triangle ADC. As before, angles at C and D are equal (both α), angle at A is 180 - 2α. Now, if there's another triangle involving A where angles relate to α.

Alternatively, consider triangle ABD. If we can find some relations there. But without knowing AB or AD, it's hard.

Wait, but AD is equal to AC, which we've already used. Also, AC is the distance from A to C, which is sqrt(a² + c²/4). And AD is the same. But how does this help?

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to find AB. For example, if we assume that A lies somewhere that creates another right angle or something.

Wait, but I'm stuck. Let me try to think differently. Maybe use coordinate system to find relations.

Let me assign coordinates as before:

D(0,0), B(22,0), C(0,c), where c = sqrt(1116). Point A lies on y = c/2. Let me write coordinates of A as (h, c/2), where h is some real number.

Now, perhaps there's a relation between AB and other segments. For example, maybe AB is connected to something?

But the problem doesn't mention AB. Wait, unless there's a missing piece. Let me check the original problem again.

Original problem says: "Given the following predicates..." and lists them. No mention of AB or any other connections. So maybe the question is about finding x, which is an angle or length derived from these configurations.

Wait, the question is to find x, where x + y = 90. Maybe x is an angle, and y is another angle, such as in triangle ABD or something. Let me think about possible angles.

Alternatively, maybe x is the length of AB, and y is the length of AC, but AC is equal to AD. Or perhaps x is the length of AB and y is the length of BC, but BC is given as 40. But then x + y = 90 would imply x = 90 - 40 = 50, which isn't among the options. So that's unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe x is the length of AD or AC, which is sqrt(a² + c²/4). If we can find a value for a, then we can compute this length.

But how to find 'a'? There must be another condition. Wait, maybe triangle ABD? If there's a right angle or something.

Wait, the problem includes the predicate RightAngle(Angle(B,D,C)), which we've used. Are there other right angles?

Wait, if we consider triangle ABD, is there any reason to believe it's right? Not necessarily. Unless...

Wait, let's think about triangle ABD. Points A(h, c/2), B(22,0), D(0,0). Can we find any relationship here?

The length AB is sqrt[(h - 22)^2 + (c/2 - 0)^2].

Length AD is sqrt[h² + (c/2)^2], which is equal to AC.

But without more info, we can't find h. So perhaps there's another condition that links h with other elements.

Wait, maybe there's a triangle involving A and C, or other points?

Alternatively, since triangle ACD is isosceles with AD=AC, and we know coordinates of C and D, perhaps there's a way to find h such that triangle ACD meets some criteria.

Wait, but we already used that AD=AC to derive that A lies on y = c/2. So that condition is already satisfied for any h. So unless there's another condition, like A lying on some other line, we can't determine h.

This suggests that there's missing information, but since the problem is solvable, I must have missed something.

Wait, going back to the original problem, perhaps I misread the predicates. Let me re-examine them.

The given predicates are:

- RightAngle(Angle(B,D,C))

- Isosceles(Triangle(C,A,D))

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,D)),LengthOf(Line(A,C)))

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)),40)

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,B)),22)

- Equals(SumOf(x,y),90)

Ah! Wait, the last predicate is Equals(SumOf(x,y),90). So x and y are variables whose sum is 90. But what are x and y? They could be lengths or angles. Since the problem involves triangles and lengths, it's plausible that x and y are lengths. For example, if x is the length of AB and y is the length of something else, or if x and y are parts of a triangle.

Alternatively, x and y could be angles. For example, if there's a triangle where two angles add to 90 degrees. But without knowing which angles, it's still ambiguous.

Wait, maybe x and y are angles in triangle BDC? For example, in the right triangle BDC, the two acute angles add to 90 degrees. So if x and y are those two angles, then x + y = 90. But then why would the problem ask to find x? Because it's given that their sum is 90, so it's trivial unless more info is given. But this seems too simple, and the answer choices suggest otherwise.

Alternatively, x and y are angles in another triangle. For example, in triangle ACD, which is isosceles. If x is one of the base angles (α) and y is the vertex angle, then x + y = 90? No, because in an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal, and the vertex angle is different. Their sum is 180, so if x and y were angles from different triangles, it's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe x is one angle and y is another angle in a different triangle, adding to 90.

Another idea: since there's a right angle at D, and triangle ACD is isosceles, perhaps there's a way to find some angle that relates to x and y.

Let me try to calculate some angles. Let's go back to the coordinates.

Point D is (0,0), C is (0,c), A is (h, c/2). Let me compute angle at D in triangle ADC, which we called α.

From earlier, we had cos(angle ADC) = [c/2]/sqrt(a² + c²/4). Let's denote this as cosα = (c/2)/sqrt(h² + c²/4).

But this expression depends on h. Without knowing h, we can't compute α. So this suggests that we need another equation to find h.

Where can we get this equation? Perhaps from another triangle or condition. Since the problem includes all the given predicates, perhaps I missed a connection.

Wait, the only other thing is that there's a right angle at D in triangle BDC. Is there a way to link this with point A?

Maybe if we consider the slopes of DA and DC. Since DC is vertical, slope is undefined. DA goes from D(0,0) to A(h, c/2), so its slope is (c/2 - 0)/(h - 0) = c/(2h). The angle between DA and DC is α, which we tried earlier.

But how does this help? Maybe there's a relationship between this angle and something else.

Alternatively, if there's a right angle involving point A. For example, if angle at A is 90 degrees, making triangle ADC a right isosceles triangle. But that would require that AD=AC and angle at A is 90. Let's check:

If triangle ADC is right-angled at A, then AD=AC, and angle at A is 90. In that case, by Pythagoras:

AD² + AC² = DC². But since AD=AC, this becomes 2AD² = DC² → AD = DC / √2.

But DC is sqrt(1116), so AD = sqrt(1116)/√2 = sqrt(1116/2) = sqrt(558). Let me check if this is possible. But this would require that point A is positioned such that angle at A is 90 degrees. But we don't have any information indicating that angle at A is right. So this is speculative.

However, if this were true, then in triangle ADC, angles at D and C would be 45 degrees each, since it's an isosceles right triangle. Then, angle at D (α) is 45 degrees. Then, if x is this angle, and y is something else, but x + y = 90. But this is just a guess.

Alternatively, if angle at D (α) is 45 degrees, then x could be 45, and y would be 45, but that sums to 90. But the answer choices don't have 45, so this might not be it.

Alternatively, maybe x is angle BAD and y is angle DAC, adding up to angle BAC. But without knowing where A is, this is uncertain.

Let me think differently. Let's assume that x and y are angles in triangle BDC. In right triangle BDC, angles at B and C add up to 90 degrees. So if x and y are those angles, then x + y = 90. But then the problem would be trivial, and the answer would depend on which angle is asked. But since the problem asks to find x, and the answer choices are specific, this suggests that x is not one of these angles. Plus, the problem might involve other angles.

Alternatively, maybe x is an angle in triangle ACD. For example, angle at A is x, and angle at C is y, so x + y = 90. But in triangle ACD, angles at C and D are equal (α), and angle at A is 180 - 2α. So if x is angle at A and y is angle at C, then x + y = (180 - 2α) + α = 180 - α. This would equal 90 only if α = 90, which would make triangle ACD degenerate. Not possible.

Alternatively, if x is angle at D (α) and y is angle at C (also α), then x + y = 2α. If this equals 90, then α = 45. So angle at D is 45 degrees, making triangle ADC a right isosceles triangle. But how to verify this?

If α = 45 degrees, then in triangle ADC, angle at D is 45 degrees. Let me see if that's possible.

From earlier, cosα = [c/2]/sqrt(h² + c²/4). If α = 45 degrees, then cosα = √2/2. So:

[c/2] / sqrt(h² + c²/4) = √2/2

Cross-multiplying:

c/2 = (√2/2) * sqrt(h² + c²/4)

Multiply both sides by 2:

c = √2 * sqrt(h² + c²/4)

Square both sides:

c² = 2*(h² + c²/4)

Expand RHS: 2h² + c²/2

Subtract c²/2 from both sides:

c² - c²/2 = 2h² → c²/2 = 2h² → h² = c²/4 → h = ±c/2.

So h = c/2 or -c/2.

Thus, point A would be at (c/2, c/2) or (-c/2, c/2). Let me check if this makes sense.

Taking h = c/2, then point A is (c/2, c/2). So coordinates:

A(c/2, c/2), D(0,0), C(0,c). Let me compute AD and AC:

AD: distance from (0,0) to (c/2, c/2) is sqrt[(c/2)^2 + (c/2)^2] = sqrt(c²/4 + c²/4) = sqrt(c²/2) = c/√2.

AC: distance from (c/2, c/2) to (0,c) is sqrt[(c/2 - 0)^2 + (c/2 - c)^2] = sqrt[(c²/4) + (-c/2)^2] = sqrt(c²/4 + c²/4) = same as AD, c/√2. So AD = AC, satisfying the isosceles condition.

So this position of A makes triangle ADC a right isosceles triangle, with right angle at A. Wait, because if AD and AC are equal and meet at A, and angle at A is 90 degrees, then it's a right isosceles triangle. Let me confirm:

Vectors AD and AC would be from A to D and A to C. Wait, vectors AD is D - A = (0 - c/2, 0 - c/2) = (-c/2, -c/2). Vector AC is C - A = (0 - c/2, c - c/2) = (-c/2, c/2). Dot product of AD and AC is (-c/2)(-c/2) + (-c/2)(c/2) = c²/4 - c²/4 = 0. So yes, they are perpendicular. Hence, angle at A is 90 degrees, making triangle ADC a right isosceles triangle. Therefore, angles at D and C are each 45 degrees.

So if this is the case, then angle at D (in triangle ADC) is 45 degrees. But earlier, in triangle BDC, angle at D is 90 degrees. How does this relate?

At point D, there are two angles: one from triangle BDC (90 degrees) and one from triangle ADC (45 degrees). These angles are adjacent, forming a larger angle. Wait, but in reality, point D has only one angle in the overall diagram. Wait, this suggests that my assumption that point A is at (c/2, c/2) leads to angle at D being split into two parts: the 90-degree angle from BDC and the 45-degree angle from ADC. But that would mean the total angle at D is 90 + 45 = 135 degrees, which is impossible because the sum of angles around a point is 360 degrees, but in this case, it's just the angle between BD and DC plus the angle between DC and DA. Wait, no—point D has two lines: one to B and one to C, and another to A. So the angle between BD and DC is 90 degrees, and the angle between DC and DA is 45 degrees, making the total angle between BD and DA equal to 90 + 45 = 135 degrees. But this is possible.

However, this requires that point A is placed such that DA makes a 45-degree angle with DC. This is achieved by placing A at (c/2, c/2), as shown. But how do we know that this is the correct position for A?

Because in this scenario, the condition that AD = AC is satisfied, and it results in a right isosceles triangle ADC. But why would this be the case? Because without additional constraints, there are infinitely many positions for A along the horizontal line y = c/2. However, the fact that the problem provides a specific answer implies that this particular position is intended, possibly due to the presence of the right angle at D in triangle BDC.

But why would this position be chosen? Perhaps because it's the only one that allows for some other property, like creating another right angle or making a specific angle measure. Alternatively, maybe there's a missing constraint that I haven't considered.

Assuming that this is the correct position for A, then angle at D in triangle ADC is 45 degrees. Now, how does this relate to the sum x + y = 90?

If x is the angle at D in triangle ADC (45 degrees), and y is the angle at B in triangle BDC, then x + y = 45 + ? Let me calculate angle at B in triangle BDC.

In triangle BDC, right-angled at D, with BD = 22, DC = c = sqrt(1116), BC = 40. The angle at B can be calculated using trigonometry.

tan(angle at B) = opposite/adjacent = DC/BD = c/22 = sqrt(1116)/22.

Calculate this value:

sqrt(1116) = sqrt(4*279) = 2*sqrt(279). So tan(angle at B) = (2*sqrt(279))/22 = sqrt(279)/11.

Compute sqrt(279): 16.7^2 = 278.89, so approx 16.7. So tan(angle at B) ≈ 16.7/11 ≈ 1.518. Then angle at B is arctan(1.518) ≈ 56.5 degrees. So if x is 45 degrees and y is 56.5, their sum is ~101.5, not 90. Not matching.

Alternatively, if x is angle at B and y is angle at D in triangle BDC (90 degrees), then x + y would be angle at B + 90, which is more than 90. Not helpful.

Alternatively, if x is angle at D in triangle ADC (45 degrees) and y is angle at C in triangle ADC (also 45 degrees), then x + y = 90 degrees. This fits the given condition SumOf(x,y) = 90. So x and y are the two base angles of triangle ADC, each 45 degrees, summing to 90.

But the question asks to find x. If x is one of these angles, then x = 45 degrees. But 45 is not among the answer choices. The choices are 37.2, 40.6, 49.4, 52.8. So this suggests that this assumption is incorrect.

Hmm. This indicates that my previous assumption about the position of A might be wrong. Let me reconsider.

Perhaps x is not one of the angles in triangle ADC. Let me think about other possibilities.

Let me recall that in triangle BDC, we have BD = 22, DC = sqrt(1116), BC = 40. Let me calculate the angles in triangle BDC. Using the Law of Cosines.

For example, angle at B: let's call it β.

cosβ = (BD² + BC² - DC²)/(2*BD*BC)

Wait, no. Law of Cosines for angle at B: 

cosβ = (BD² + BC² - DC²)/(2*BD*BC)? Wait, no. Wait, Law of Cosines: for angle at B, opposite side is DC. So:

DC² = BD² + BC² - 2*BD*BC*cosβ.

Wait, no. Wait, in triangle BDC, angle at B is between BD and BC. Wait, actually, in triangle BDC, the sides are BD = 22, DC = sqrt(1116), BC = 40.

Wait, applying Law of Cosines to find angle at B:

cosβ = (BD² + BC² - DC²) / (2*BD*BC) ?

Wait, no. The Law of Cosines is c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(C), where C is the angle opposite side c.

In triangle BDC, angle at B is opposite side DC. So:

DC² = BD² + BC² - 2*BD*BC*cos(angle at B)

So:

1116 = 22² + 40² - 2*22*40*cosβ

Calculate 22² = 484, 40² = 1600, so:

1116 = 484 + 1600 - 2*22*40*cosβ

1116 = 2084 - 1760*cosβ

Rearranging:

1760*cosβ = 2084 - 1116 = 968

cosβ = 968 / 1760 = simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 8: 121/220 ≈ 0.55

So β ≈ arccos(0.55) ≈ 56.6 degrees.

So angle at B is approximately 56.6 degrees.

If x is this angle β, and y is something else, like angle at D (90 degrees), then x + y would be 146.6, not 90. Not matching.

Alternatively, if x is angle at D (90 degrees) and y is angle at C in triangle BDC, then x + y = 90 + angle at C. Let's calculate angle at C.

Using Law of Cosines again for angle at C:

cosγ = (DC² + BC² - BD²) / (2*DC*BC)

Wait, angle at C is opposite BD. So:

BD² = DC² + BC² - 2*DC*BC*cosγ

So:

22² = 1116 + 40² - 2*sqrt(1116)*40*cosγ

Wait, this seems messy. Alternatively, since it's a right triangle at D, angles at B and C are complementary. So angle at C = 90 - angle at B ≈ 90 - 56.6 = 33.4 degrees.

So if x is angle at C (33.4) and y is angle at B (56.6), their sum is 90. Ah! This fits the condition SumOf(x,y)=90. So x and y are the two non-right angles in triangle BDC, which add to 90 degrees. But the problem asks to find x, which would be either of these angles. However, the answer choices don't include 33.4 or 56.6. But wait, let me calculate more precisely.

Let me recalculate angle at C. In right triangle BDC, angle at C is arcsin(BD/BC) = arcsin(22/40) = arcsin(11/20) ≈ arcsin(0.55) ≈ 33.37 degrees.

So if x is angle at C, then x ≈ 33.37, which is not among the options. Similarly, angle at B is 56.63 degrees. Still not matching the answer choices.

But the answer choices are 37.2, 40.6, 49.4, 52.8. None of these match 33.4 or 56.6. So this suggests that x is not one of these angles.

Wait, but maybe x is not in triangle BDC. Let me think of other possibilities.

Back to the earlier assumption that point A is at (c/2, c/2), making triangle ADC a right isosceles triangle with angles 45°, 45°, 90°. If this is the case, then angle at A is 90°, and angles at D and C are 45° each.

Now, consider triangle ABD. Points A(c/2, c/2), B(22,0), D(0,0). Let me calculate the lengths of AB, AD, and BD.

AD is c/√2, as calculated before.

BD is 22.

AB is distance from A(c/2, c/2) to B(22,0):

AB = sqrt[(22 - c/2)^2 + (0 - c/2)^2] = sqrt[(22 - c/2)^2 + (c/2)^2]

Let me expand this:

= sqrt[22² - 22*c + (c²/4) + c²/4]

= sqrt[484 - 22c + c²/2]

Now, if I substitute c = sqrt(1116), let's compute this expression.

First, c² = 1116.

So inside the square root: 484 - 22c + 1116/2 = 484 - 22c + 558 = 1042 - 22c.

So AB = sqrt(1042 - 22c).

But c = sqrt(1116) ≈ 33.409.

So 22c ≈ 22 * 33.409 ≈ 734.998.

So 1042 - 734.998 ≈ 307.002.

So AB ≈ sqrt(307.002) ≈ 17.52.

But this is just a numerical value. How does this help?

If there's a relationship between AB and other lengths, but I don't see it.

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involving AB and other sides that forms a right triangle, allowing us to use Pythagorean theorem.

Alternatively, maybe x is AB, and y is something else, such that x + y = 90. But AB is approximately 17.52, and if y is 72.48, but this doesn't align with answer choices.

Alternatively, if x is the length of AD, which is c/√2 = sqrt(1116)/√2 = sqrt(558) ≈ 23.62. If x is this value, and y is something else, but again, not matching.

Alternatively, if x is the length of AC, which is same as AD, so same value.

This approach isn't yielding the desired answer. Let me try to think of another way.

Let me revisit the idea that x + y = 90, and the answer choices suggest that x is likely a decimal value around 37-52. Let me consider the possibility that x is an angle in a triangle where it is part of a larger triangle, like triangle ABC.

To explore this, let me find the coordinates of A. Earlier, we assumed A is at (c/2, c
