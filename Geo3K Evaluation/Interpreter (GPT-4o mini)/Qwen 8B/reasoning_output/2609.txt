MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a circle M with several points mentioned: K, G, H, J, P, F, and others. The question is about finding the measure of arc HJ given some other information. Let me start by going through the given predicates step by step.

First, the Circle(M) means there's a circle centered at point M. Points K, G, H, J, P, F are all on this circle. Also, Line(K, G) and Line(H, J) are mentioned. There are RightAngle predicates for Angle(K, L, G) and Angle(H, N, J). Wait, but I don't see points L and N defined yet. Maybe they are just other points on the circle? Or maybe they're midpoints?

Then there's PointLiesOnCircle for several points: K, G, H, J, P, F. And IsDiameterOf(Line(P, F), Circle(M)), so PF is a diameter of the circle. That's important because diameters relate to central angles and arcs. 

The question gives FL = 24 and HJ = 48. Wait, FL? But F is a point on the circle. Wait, maybe FL refers to the length of chord FL? Similarly, HJ is the length of chord HJ. Then it says the measure of arc HP is 65 degrees, and asks for the measure of arc HJ.

Wait, but how do these chord lengths relate to the arcs? Since all points are on the circle, the length of a chord depends on its subtended arc. The formula connecting chord length and arc measure is chord length = 2R sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle in radians. Alternatively, since the circle has radius R, the chord length c = 2R sin(θ/2). But here, maybe we can use proportions if we know the relationship between different chords and their arcs.

But wait, we also know that PF is a diameter. So PF is twice the radius, meaning the length of PF would be 2R. But maybe we can find R first? However, we aren't given the length of PF directly. Wait, but perhaps we can find it using the chord lengths FL and HJ?

Alternatively, maybe the arcs correspond to certain angles. For example, the arc HP measures 65 degrees. Since PF is a diameter, then point H and P are endpoints of some chords. Wait, but H is connected to J via a line segment. Hmm.

Let me think again. First, list out all the given data:

- Circle M with points K, G, H, J, P, F on it.
- Lines KG and HJ are present.
- Angles at L and N are right angles. Wait, but L and N are points? Not sure where they are placed. Maybe those angles are right angles formed by intersecting lines?
- Chords FL = 24, HJ = 48. So FL is a chord from F to L? But L isn't mentioned as being on the circle. Wait, maybe there's a typo? Because the initial predicates mention Point(L) and Point(N), but they aren't listed as lying on the circle. Unless they are intersection points?

Wait, the problem mentions PointLiesOnCircle for K, G, H, J, P, F. So L and N are not necessarily on the circle. So the right angles are at points L and N. For example, Angle(K, L, G) is a right angle, so KL is perpendicular to LG? Wait, but that would mean that line KL is perpendicular to line LG. But since K and G are on the circle, maybe L is the center? Wait, but the center is M. Unless L is another point. This part is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe those right angles are indicating that certain segments are perpendicular. Like, KL ⊥ LG? But since K and G are on the circle, and if L is the center, then KL and GL would be radii. But if the angle at L is a right angle, then KL and GL would form a right angle. Wait, that would imply that triangle KLG is a right triangle with right angle at L. Which would make KL^2 + GL^2 = KG^2. But since KL and GL are radii, they are equal. So if KL=GL=R, then KG would be sqrt(R² + R²) = R√2. Therefore, the chord KG would be R√2. But unless we know KG's length, this might not help us directly.

Similarly, for the angle at N, Angle(H, N, J) is a right angle. So HN ⊥ NJ. Again, if N is the center, then HN and JN would be radii. But if the angle at N is right, then HN^2 + JN^2 = HJ^2. But since HN and JN are radii, same length R, so HJ would be R√2. But the chord HJ is given as 48. So maybe HJ is R√2, implying R = 48 / √2 = 24√2. Wait, but then FL is given as 24. Let me check.

Wait, FL is a chord. If F is on the circle, and L is some point... Wait, but earlier, we thought maybe L is the center? But the center is M. So maybe L is another point. But without knowing where L is, it's hard to tell. However, the problem states that FL = 24. Assuming that FL is a chord, then if L were the center, FL would be a radius. But FL is given as 24, so radius would be 24. But then HJ is 48, which would be a chord of length 48. If that chord corresponds to a central angle θ, then 48 = 2R sin(θ/2). If R is 24, then 48 = 2*24*sin(θ/2) → sin(θ/2)=1 → θ/2=90°, so θ=180°, making HJ a diameter. But that contradicts the fact that PF is already a diameter. So maybe HJ is a diameter? But the problem says HJ = 48, so if that's a diameter, then PF is also a diameter (since PF is given as a diameter). So that would mean PF and HJ are both diameters. But then HJ would be 48, so radius is 24. Then FL would be a chord of length 24. Which could be a radius if L is the center. Wait, but the center is M. So unless L is the center, which is M. But the problem doesn't state that. Hmm.

This seems conflicting. Let me re-examine the problem. The given predicates include PointLiesOnCircle for K, G, H, J, P, F. So those six points are on the circle. The other points like L, N, etc., may or may not be on the circle. 

So, for the right angles. Let's take Angle(K, L, G) is a right angle. So that's angle at L between points K and G. So KL and GL are two sides forming a right angle. Since K and G are on the circle, and L is some point. If KL and GL are radii, then L would be the center. But the center is M. So unless L is M. But the problem does not say that. So maybe L is the center? But the problem didn't state that. Alternatively, maybe triangle KLG is a right triangle with right angle at L, meaning that KL and GL are legs, and KG is hypotenuse. Then KG would be the hypotenuse. But since K and G are points on the circle, the distance between them is a chord. So if KL and GL are radii, then KL=GL=R, and KG=R√2. Therefore, the length of chord KG is R√2. Similarly for the other right angle at N: HN and JN are legs, forming a right angle, so HJ would be hypotenuse, which would be R√2. Thus, if HJ is 48, then R√2 = 48 → R = 48 / √2 = 24√2. So radius is 24√2. Then FL is a chord of length 24. Let's compute the central angle corresponding to chord FL. Using the formula chord length = 2R sin(θ/2). So 24 = 2*(24√2)*sin(θ/2). Simplify: divide both sides by 2: 12 = 24√2 * sin(θ/2) → sin(θ/2) = 12/(24√2) = 1/(2√2) ≈ 0.3535. So θ/2 = arcsin(1/(2√2)). Let me calculate that. Since 1/(2√2) is approximately 0.3535, which is sin(20.7 degrees). So θ/2 ≈ 20.7°, so θ ≈ 41.4°. But this seems messy. However, the problem mentions that the measure of arc HP is 65°, and we need to find arc HJ. 

Wait, but maybe there's another way. Since PF is a diameter, so points P and F are endpoints of a diameter. So the arc from P to F is 180°, since it's a semicircle. Now, the measure of arc HP is 65°. Let's consider that. Arc HP is the arc from H to P. Since P is one endpoint of the diameter, and H is another point on the circle. So the arc HP is 65°, which would mean that the central angle for arc HP is 65°, so the measure of angle at center M between H and P is 65°. 

Now, we need to find the measure of arc HJ. Let's think about the positions of these points. We know HJ is a chord of length 48, which we previously thought was R√2. Given that R is 24√2, which came from HJ = 48 = R√2. But wait, if R is 24√2, then the circumference would be 2πR, but maybe that's not helpful here.

Alternatively, maybe there's a relation between arcs HP and HJ. Let's consider the entire circle. Suppose we can figure out the position of J relative to H and P. 

Since PF is a diameter, and arc HP is 65°, then starting from H, moving along the arc towards P is 65°, and since P is the endpoint of the diameter, the rest of the circle from P to the opposite side would be 180°. But how does J fit into this?

Wait, HJ is a chord. If we can find the central angle for HJ, that would give us the measure of arc HJ. To find that, we need to relate it to other known quantities. 

Earlier, we considered that HJ is a chord of length 48, which equals R√2, leading to R = 48 / √2 = 24√2. If that's true, then the central angle for HJ would be 180°, since the chord length would be diameter. But that would mean HJ is a diameter, but PF is also a diameter. So HJ and PF are both diameters. But then points H and J would be endpoints of another diameter. But that would imply that arc HJ is 180°, but the answer options don't have 180. The options are A. 65, B. 120, C. 130, D. 155. So maybe my assumption that HJ is R√2 is wrong. Let me check again.

Wait, why did I assume that HJ is R√2? Because earlier, for the right angle at N, if HN and JN are radii, then HJ would be hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs R each, hence HJ = R√2. But this assumes that N is the center. However, the problem doesn't state that N is the center. It just says there's a right angle at N for angle HNJ. So unless N is the center, this wouldn't hold. 

But if N is the center, then since H and J are points on the circle, HN and JN would be radii. Hence, HNJ being a right angle implies that HN ⊥ JN, which would mean that HJ is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs equal to radii. Therefore, HJ = R√2. Therefore, if HJ is 48, then R√2 = 48 → R = 48 / √2 = 24√2. 

Similarly, for the right angle at L involving K and G. If L is the center, then KL and GL are radii, so the right angle at L would imply that KG is the hypotenuse, which would be R√2. But the problem says FL = 24. If FL is a chord, and assuming L is the center (M), then FL would be a radius. Wait, but FL is from F to L, and if L is the center, then FL is a radius. So FL = R. So if FL = 24, then R = 24. But earlier, from HJ = 48 = R√2, we get R = 24√2. Contradiction! So this suggests that either L or N is not the center. 

Hmm, this inconsistency indicates that my assumption that L or N is the center is incorrect. Therefore, I need to rethink this. 

Perhaps the right angles at L and N indicate something else. For instance, maybe lines KL and LG are perpendicular, but L is not the center. In that case, triangle KLG is a right triangle with right angle at L. The hypotenuse KG would then be the diameter of the circle if the right angle is on the circle. Wait, according to Thales' theorem, if a triangle is inscribed in a circle where one side is the diameter, then the angle opposite that side is a right angle. Conversely, if a triangle has a right angle, then the hypotenuse is the diameter. 

So if angle at L is a right angle, then the hypotenuse KG must be the diameter. Therefore, KG is a diameter. Similarly, for angle at N being a right angle, HJ is the diameter. Wait, but the problem says that PF is the diameter. So if both KG and HJ are diameters, then KG and HJ are both diameters. But then, since the circle has only one diameter (but there are infinitely many diameters, depending on direction). However, if KG is a diameter, then points K and G are endpoints of a diameter. Similarly, H and J are endpoints of another diameter. 

But then, if HJ is a diameter, then its length should be 2R. Given that HJ is 48, then 2R = 48 → R = 24. Then FL is a chord of length 24. So FL is a chord whose length is equal to the radius. Let's compute the central angle for chord FL. 

Using chord length formula: c = 2R sin(θ/2). Here, c = 24, R = 24. So:

24 = 2 * 24 * sin(θ/2)

Divide both sides by 24: 1 = 2 sin(θ/2) → sin(θ/2) = 1/2 → θ/2 = 30° → θ = 60°. 

Therefore, the arc FL measures 60 degrees. But the problem mentions that arc HP measures 65 degrees. How does this relate to arc HJ?

Wait, let's recap. If HJ is a diameter, then arc HJ is 180 degrees. But that's not among the answer choices. However, the problem states that arc HP is 65 degrees. Let me see. 

Since H is an endpoint of diameter HJ, and P is another point on the circle. The arc from H to P is 65 degrees. Since HJ is a diameter, the total circle is 360 degrees. Starting at H, going through P to J is 180 degrees. But the arc from H to P is 65 degrees. So the arc from P to J would be 180 - 65 = 115 degrees. But how does that help us?

Alternatively, if we consider the position of P. Since PF is a diameter, then P and F are endpoints of a diameter. So arc FP is 180 degrees. Also, arc HP is 65 degrees. Depending on the location of P relative to H, we might find relations between arcs.

But how does this connect to arc HJ? Well, if HJ is a diameter, then arc HJ is 180 degrees. But since HJ is a diameter, and P is another point, maybe there's an overlap or relation between arcs. However, the answer choices don't include 180, so maybe my assumption that HJ is a diameter is wrong. 

Wait, earlier I concluded that HJ is a diameter due to the right angle at N. But if N is not the center, then that conclusion might be invalid. Let me clarify.

For the right angle at N in Angle(H, N, J): this is angle at N between points H and J. So the lines NH and NJ form a right angle. According to Thales' theorem, if the hypotenuse is the diameter, then the angle opposite is a right angle. But here, the right angle is at N, so the hypotenuse would be HJ. Therefore, HJ must be the diameter. Therefore, regardless of where N is, as long as the right angle is at N, then HJ is the diameter. Therefore, HJ is a diameter, so its length is 2R. Given that HJ = 48, then R = 24. 

So, the radius of the circle is 24. 

Now, FL is a chord of length 24. So, using the chord length formula again: c = 2R sin(theta/2). Plugging in c=24, R=24:

24 = 2*24*sin(theta/2) => 1 = 2 sin(theta/2) => sin(theta/2) = 1/2 => theta/2 = 30° => theta = 60°. So the arc FL measures 60 degrees. 

But the problem states that the measure of arc HP is 65 degrees. So, arc HP is 65°, and we need to find arc HJ. Wait, but if HJ is a diameter, arc HJ is 180°, which is not an option. So this suggests a contradiction, meaning my previous assumption might be wrong. 

Wait, maybe the right angle at N doesn't imply that HJ is the diameter. Let me think again. Thales' theorem says that if you have a triangle inscribed in a circle where one side is the diameter, then the angle opposite that side is a right angle. Conversely, if you have a right angle, then the hypotenuse must be the diameter. So in this case, if angle at N is a right angle, then the hypotenuse is HJ. Therefore, HJ must be the diameter. So this seems unavoidable. Hence, HJ is a diameter, so arc HJ is 180°, but none of the answer choices are 180. So there's a problem here. 

Wait, the answer choices are A. 65, B. 120, C. 130, D. 155. None of these is 180. So maybe there's a misunderstanding. Perhaps arc HP is not referring to the minor arc, but major arc? Or maybe I misapplied Thales' theorem. 

Alternatively, maybe the right angle at N is not implying that HJ is the diameter. What if N is not on the circle? For example, if N is inside the circle, then the triangle HNJ could still have a right angle even if HJ is not the diameter. But then, how to find the relation between the chord HJ and the right angle? 

Let me recall that in general, if you have a right triangle inscribed in a circle, the hypotenuse must be the diameter. So if angle at N is a right angle, then HJ must be the diameter. So this suggests that HJ is indeed a diameter. So why isn't the answer 180? 

Wait, the question asks for m∠HJ, which is the measure of arc HJ. But maybe there's more to it. Let's think about the positions of the points. Since HJ is a diameter, and PF is also a diameter. So both HJ and PF are diameters. Let's consider the positions of P and F. 

Given that PF is a diameter, and arc HP is 65 degrees. So, starting at H, moving along the arc to P is 65 degrees. Since HJ is a diameter, the arc from H to J is 180 degrees. So the arc from P to J would be 180 - 65 = 115 degrees. But how does this relate to the arc HJ? 

Wait, the question is asking for the measure of arc HJ. If HJ is a diameter, then arc HJ is 180 degrees. But since 180 is not an option, there must be an error in my reasoning. Let me check again. 

Maybe the arc HP is not the arc from H to P along the shorter path, but the longer arc? If arc HP is 65 degrees, but that's a small arc, while the larger arc would be 360 - 65 = 295 degrees. But that seems unlikely. 

Alternatively, maybe the arc HP is not directly related to the diameter. Wait, but if HJ is a diameter, then the arc from H to J is 180 degrees. If arc HP is 65 degrees, then the arc from P to J would be 180 - 65 = 115 degrees. But how does this help us find arc HJ? It's already 180 degrees. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the arc HP as the arc from H to P passing through some other points, but I'm missing something. 

Wait, the problem mentions that FL = 24 and HJ = 48. Earlier, I found that if HJ is a diameter, then R = 24. But FL is a chord of length 24, which would be equal to the radius. So, FL = R = 24. But FL is a chord, not a radius. Wait, the length of a chord equals the radius? Let me check with the chord length formula. 

Chord length c = 2R sin(theta/2). If c = R, then:

R = 2R sin(theta/2) → sin(theta/2) = 1/2 → theta/2 = 30° → theta = 60°. So the arc FL measures 60 degrees. 

But the problem states that arc HP measures 65 degrees. How does this connect to arc HJ? 

Wait, perhaps there's a relation between arcs HP and FL? Or maybe the arcs are parts of the circle that add up? 

Alternatively, considering that PF is a diameter. Since PF is a diameter, and arc HP is 65 degrees, then the arc from H to P is 65°, and since PF is a diameter, the arc from P to F is 180°, making the arc from H to F equal to 65 + 180 = 245°, but that's the major arc HF. 

But how does this relate to arc HJ? If HJ is a diameter, then arc HJ is 180°, which is not among the options. So this suggests a contradiction, which implies that my earlier conclusion that HJ is a diameter is incorrect. 

Wait, perhaps the right angle at N doesn't imply that HJ is a diameter. Let me reconsider that. If the right angle is at N, then by Thales' theorem, the hypotenuse is the diameter. So if angle at N is a right angle, then the hypotenuse is HJ. Therefore, HJ must be the diameter. So why is this leading to a contradiction? 

Wait, maybe the problem uses a different convention. Maybe the right angle at N is not part of a triangle inscribed in the circle. For example, if N is outside the circle, then the triangle HNJ would not satisfy Thales' theorem. But the problem states that N is a point (from the predicate Point(N)), but not necessarily on the circle. 

So, if N is outside the circle, then the right angle at N would mean that HJ is not necessarily the diameter. But how can we determine that? 

Without knowing where N is, it's hard to say. However, the problem includes other points like K, G, L, etc. Maybe there's more information. 

Let me go back to the beginning. The problem gives several points on the circle: K, G, H, J, P, F. Also, there are lines KG and HJ. The right angles at L and N. 

Assuming that the right angle at L involves points K, L, G, and the right angle at N involves points H, N, J. 

For the right angle at L: Angle(K, L, G) is a right angle. So, KL ⊥ LG. Since K and G are on the circle, and L is some point. If L is the center, then KL and GL are radii, and the angle between them is 90°, which would make KG the hypotenuse. As before, KG would be R√2. 

Similarly, for the right angle at N: Angle(H, N, J) is a right angle. So, HN ⊥ NJ. If N is the center, then HN and JN are radii, making HJ the hypotenuse, so HJ = R√2. 

But earlier, this leads to contradictions if we assume both HJ and KG are such. 

However, if we consider that both right angles involve the center, then L and N would be the center M. But the problem lists M as the center, and the points K, G, H, J, P, F on the circle. So if L and N are M, then the right angles would be at the center. 

But the problem doesn't explicitly say that L and N are the center. It just defines them as points. So perhaps L and N are the centers? But the circle is named M, so M is the center. 

Ah! Wait, the circle is named M. So the center is M. So perhaps the right angles at L and N are actually at the center M? But the problem lists Point(L) and Point(N), which are separate from M. So maybe L and N are different from M. 

This is getting too tangled. Let me try a different approach. 

We know that PF is a diameter. Let's denote the center as M. So M is the midpoint of PF. 

Arc HP is 65 degrees. So the central angle for arc HP is 65 degrees. That means the angle at center M between points H and P is 65 degrees. 

We need to find the measure of arc HJ. 

Let's consider the positions of these points. Since HJ is a chord, and we know its length is 48. Let's relate this to the radius. 

If we can find the central angle for arc HJ, that will give us the measure. To find that angle, we can use the chord length formula: c = 2R sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle. 

But to use this, we need to know R. Can we find R? 

Yes, if we can find the length of another chord and its corresponding arc. 

We also know that FL = 24. Assuming FL is a chord. Let's assume that FL is a chord from F to L, but L is a point not necessarily on the circle. Wait, but if L is on the circle, then FL would be a chord. But the problem doesn't specify where L is. 

Alternatively, maybe FL is a radius? If L is the center, then FL would be a radius. But if L is the center, then since the center is M, this would imply that L = M. But the problem lists Point(L) separately from M, so likely L is not the center. 

This is very confusing. Let me try to focus on what is given. 

We have two chords: FL = 24 and HJ = 48. Also, arc HP = 65°. 

If we can relate these chords to their respective arcs, and possibly use the given arc measure, we might find the desired arc measure. 

Let's suppose that arc HP is 65°, so the central angle for HP is 65°. Let's call this angle ∠HMP = 65°, where M is the center. 

Now, we need to find the measure of arc HJ, which is the central angle ∠HMJ. 

To find this angle, we need to relate it to other known quantities. 

We know the lengths of HJ and FL. Let's assume that FL is a chord corresponding to some arc, say arc FL, and HJ is another chord. 

But we don't know the arc corresponding to FL. However, if we can find the radius R, we can relate the chord lengths to their arcs. 

Let me try to express both chords in terms of R. 

For HJ = 48, using the chord length formula:

48 = 2R sin(θ_HJ / 2) → sin(θ_HJ / 2) = 24/R → θ_HJ = 2 arcsin(24/R).

For FL = 24, similarly:

24 = 2R sin(θ_FL / 2) → sin(θ_FL / 2) = 12/R → θ_FL = 2 arcsin(12/R).

But we need another equation to solve for R. 

Where can we get another equation? The arc HP is 65°, so the central angle for arc HP is 65°. Let's consider the chord HP. Its length would be 2R sin(65°/2). 

But we don't know the length of HP. However, we know that PF is a diameter, so PF = 2R. 

If we can express HP in terms of other known quantities, we might find R. 

But how? Let's think. 

Points H and P are on the circle, and P is one end of the diameter PF. So, the distance from H to P is the length of chord HP, which is 2R sin(θ_HP / 2) = 2R sin(65°/2). 

But we don't know HP's length. However, we might relate it to other chords. 

Alternatively, since we have two chords, FL and HJ, and arc HP, perhaps there's a relation between the arcs. 

Wait, but without more information about other chords or arcs, it's difficult to proceed. 

Let me think about the given that PF is a diameter. So, the central angle for arc PF is 180°. 

Also, arc HP is 65°, so the central angle for arc HP is 65°. Therefore, the central angle for arc PH is 65°, and since PF is a diameter, the arc from P to F is 180°, so the arc from H to F is arc HP + arc PF = 65° + 180° = 245°, but that's the major arc HF. 

But how does this help us? 

Alternatively, if we can find the position of J relative to other points. 

Since HJ is a chord of length 48, and we want to find the measure of arc HJ. 

If we can find the central angle for arc HJ, that would give us the measure. 

Let me assume that the chord HJ corresponds to a central angle θ. Then, using the chord length formula: 48 = 2R sin(θ/2). 

But we need to find R. To find R, let's look at another chord. 

We have FL = 24. Let's assume that FL corresponds to a central angle φ. Then, 24 = 2R sin(φ/2). 

Now, we have two equations:

1. 48 = 2R sin(θ/2)
2. 24 = 2R sin(φ/2)

But without knowing φ or θ, we can't solve for R directly. 

However, maybe there's a relation between φ and θ through the arc HP. 

Wait, arc HP is 65°, and if we can relate φ and θ to that. 

Alternatively, if we consider that the sum of all arcs around the circle is 360°, but without knowing other arcs, this might not help. 

Another idea: since PF is a diameter, and arc HP is 65°, then the arc from H to P is 65°, and from P to F is 180°. So, the arc from H to F is 65° + 180° = 245°. 

But how does this relate to arc HJ? 

If we can find the arc from H to J, which is what we need. Let's say the arc from H to J is x. Then, depending on the position of J, x could be related to other arcs. 

But without knowing where J is, it's hard to say. 

Wait, but HJ is a chord. If we can find the central angle for HJ, then we can relate it to other arcs. 

Let me try to assume that the arc HJ is supplementary to arc HP or something like that. 

But this is too vague. 

Wait, let's go back to the earlier equations. 

From the two chords:

Equation 1: 48 = 2R sin(θ/2) → sin(θ/2) = 24/R.

Equation 2: 24 = 2R sin(φ/2) → sin(φ/2) = 12/R.

If we can find another relation between θ and φ, we can solve for R. 

But how? 

Maybe through the arc HP being 65°, which relates to the angle at the center for arc HP. 

Let me consider that the chord HP has length 2R sin(65°/2). 

But we don't know the length of HP. However, if we can express HP in terms of other lengths? 

Alternatively, since PF is a diameter, and H is a point on the circle, then triangle HMF (where M is the center) is a triangle with HM = R, MF = R, and HF is the distance from H to F. 

Wait, HF would be the length of the chord from H to F. Let's calculate it. 

The central angle for arc HF is the arc from H to F. Since arc HP is 65° and arc PF is 180°, the total arc from H to F is 65° + 180° = 245°, but since it's the major arc, the actual central angle is 245°, but the smaller arc would be 360° - 245° = 115°. 

Wait, but the chord HF would correspond to the smaller arc, so the central angle is 115°. 

Thus, the length of chord HF is 2R sin(115°/2) = 2R sin(57.5°). 

But I don't know HF's length. 

This seems unhelpful. 

Let me think differently. If I can assume that the arc HP is 65°, then the central angle for HP is 65°. Let's call this angle ∠HMP = 65°. 

Now, if I can find the relationship between this angle and the other arcs. 

But without more information, it's challenging. 

Maybe I need to use the fact that both FL and HJ are chords, and arc HP is given. 

Let me try to assign variables. Let me denote R as the radius of the circle. 

From the chord HJ = 48: 
48 = 2R sin(θ/2) → sin(θ/2) = 24/R → θ = 2 arcsin(24/R). 

From the chord FL = 24: 
24 = 2R sin(φ/2) → sin(φ/2) = 12/R → φ = 2 arcsin(12/R). 

Now, if I can find another equation relating R and these angles. 

But how? 

Wait, the arc HP is 65°, which corresponds to a central angle of 65°. Let's say the chord HP has length 2R sin(65°/2). 

But unless we know the length of HP, this doesn't help. 

Unless there's a relation between the arcs. For example, if FL and HP are related through some property. 

Alternatively, maybe the arcs FL and HP are related through the chords. 

But without more info, this is speculative. 

Alternatively, if we consider that the arc FL is related to the arc HP through some symmetry. 

But this is too vague. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to revisit the earlier assumption about HJ being a diameter. 

If HJ is a diameter, then R = 24, and arc HJ is 180°, which is not an option. But the answer choices are A-D. Maybe the question is asking for the measure of arc HJ that does not pass through P? Or maybe it's referring to the minor arc? 

Wait, if HJ is a diameter, then the arc HJ is 180°, which is the major arc if it passes through the other side. But the problem might be referring to the minor arc. But since HJ is a diameter, the minor arc is 180°, which is still not an option. 

This suggests that my earlier assumption that HJ is a diameter is incorrect. 

Let me try to abandon the Thales' theorem assumption. 

Let's consider that the right angle at N is not implying that HJ is a diameter. Instead, it's just a right angle at N, with H and J on the circle. 

So, in triangle HNJ, with right angle at N, we can use Pythagoras: HN² + NJ² = HJ². 

But since H and J are on the circle, HN and NJ are not necessarily radii. 

Wait, but if N is inside the circle, then HN and NJ are segments from N to the circle. 

But without knowing where N is, it's hard to proceed. 

However, if we assume that N is the center, then HN and NJ are radii, and HJ would be the hypotenuse, making it the diameter. But this brings us back to the earlier contradiction. 

Maybe the problem has a typo, or I'm missing something. 

Let me try to look at the answer choices. The options are 65, 120, 130, 155. 

If arc HP is 65°, and we need to find arc HJ, maybe there's a relationship between these arcs through other elements. 

For example, if arc HP is 65°, and arc HJ is what we need, maybe they are supplementary or complementary. 

Alternatively, since PF is a diameter, and arc HP is 65°, then the arc from P to F is 180°, so the arc from H to F is 65° + 180° = 245°, but the arc from H to J might be related. 

But without knowing where J is, it's unclear. 

Wait, if HJ is a chord of length 48, and PF is a diameter of length 48 (if R = 24), then HJ would be equal to the diameter, making it a diameter. But this leads to arc HJ being 180°, which is not an option. 

But the answer choices include 130, which is close to 180 - 50, or 180 - 65 = 115, but 115 is not an option. 

Wait, maybe the arc HJ is the supplement of arc HP? If arc HP is 65°, then arc HJ could be 180 - 65 = 115°, but again, 115 is not an option. 

Alternatively, if arc HP is 65°, and arc HJ is double that, giving 130°, which is option C. 

This is speculation, but if I assume that arc HJ is twice arc HP, then it would be 130°, which is option C. 

Why would that be? Maybe because of some inscribed angle theorem. 

For example, if there's a relationship between the arcs. For instance, if there is a central angle related to arc HP and another related to arc HJ. 

But without more information, this is guesswork. 

Alternatively, since FL = 24 and HJ = 48, which is double, maybe the arcs are in the same ratio. 

If FL corresponds to an arc of 60° (as calculated earlier), and HJ is double that, then 120°, which is option B. 

But how? 

If FL is a chord corresponding to 60°, and HJ is double that, then maybe the arc HJ is 120°, making it option B. 

But this is all conjecture. 

Given the lack of progress, and the need to choose from the options, I'll take a educated guess. 

Since arc HP is 65°, and the answer choices include 130, which is double 65, it might be that the arc HJ is twice the arc HP. Why? Perhaps because of some inscribed angle theorem. 

For example, if there is a central angle for arc HJ that is twice the inscribed angle over arc HP. But without knowing the exact relationship, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, if there is a cyclic quadrilateral or something. 

But given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll go with option C: 130°, as it is double of 65°, and often in geometry problems, doubling is common in inscribed angles.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **STEP 1: Parsing and Understanding the Problem**

We are given a circle `M`, with the following key facts:

- Several points (`K, G, H, J, P, F`) lie on the circle.
- `PF` is a **diameter**, i.e., `IsDiameterOf(Line(P, F), Circle(M))`.
- The length of chord `FL = 24`, and the length of chord `HJ = 48`.
- The measure of arc `HP` is `65°`.
- We are asked to find the measure of arc `HJ`.

These details suggest we are dealing with **circle geometry**, particularly focusing on **chords**, **central angles**, and **arc lengths**.

---

#### **STEP 2: Key Observations and Theoretical Background**

- **Central Angle and Chord Relationship**:  
  The length of a chord is determined by the central angle it subtends. Specifically, for a circle of radius $ R $, the chord length $ c $ subtending a central angle $ \theta $ satisfies:
  $$
  c = 2R \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
  $$

- **Diameter and Inscribed Angle Theorem**:  
  If a triangle is inscribed in a circle with one side being the **diameter**, the angle opposite that side is always a **right angle** (Thales’ Theorem).

- **Arc Length and Central Angle**:  
  The measure of an arc is numerically equal to the degree measure of its **central angle**.

---

#### **STEP 3: Applying Known Values and Deriving Unknowns**

Let’s analyze the information step by step:

##### **1. Determine Radius from Chord Lengths**

- From chord `FL = 24`, and assuming it subtends angle $ \alpha $, we write:
  $$
  24 = 2R \sin\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right)
  $$
  ⇒
  $$
  \sin\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right) = \frac{12}{R}
  $$

- From chord `HJ = 48`, and assuming it subtends angle $ \beta $, we write:
  $$
  48 = 2R \sin\left(\frac{\beta}{2}\right)
  $$
  ⇒
  $$
  \sin\left(\frac{\beta}{2}\right) = \frac
