Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the setup. 

We have points M, L, N, P, B. There's a circle B. Lines ML and MP are mentioned, along with line NP. Also, there are angles at point N involving M, L, and B. Let me try to visualize this. 

So, Circle B has points N and P lying on it. Line ML is tangent to the circle at point L, and line MP is a secant passing through the circle. Wait, but if MP is a secant, then it should intersect the circle at two points. But since P is on the circle, maybe the other intersection is another point? Or perhaps MP starts at M outside the circle, passes through P on the circle, and maybe another point? Hmm. Also, Point M is mentioned, so maybe M is outside the circle because ML is tangent and MP is secant. That would make sense—M is an external point from which two lines are drawn: one tangent (ML) and one secant (MP). 

Given angles: Measure of Angle(N, M, L) is 36 degrees. So that's angle at point M between points N and L. Then Measure of Angle(N, L, B) is 78 degrees. Wait, angle at point L between points N and B? Wait, point B is the circle. Maybe that's a typo? Wait, the original says MeasureOf(Angle(N,L,B)) = 78. So angle at point L, with segments LN and LB. Since B is a circle, maybe that refers to a radius? Because if B is the center of the circle, then LB would be a radius. Wait, but the first predicate says Circle(B), so B is the center. So yes, B is the center of the circle. Therefore, LB is a radius. 

Also, Point N lies on the circle, so NB is a radius. So LN is a chord of the circle, and LB is a radius. So angle at L between N and B would be formed by chord LN and radius LB. 

Now, the question asks for mLP, which I think is the measure of arc LP on the circle. So we need to find the measure of arc LP. 

Let me recall some circle theorems. When dealing with tangents and secants, there's the Tangent-Secant Theorem, which states that the square of the tangent segment equals the product of the entire secant segment and its external part. But here, we might need to use angle measures. 

Also, angles formed by tangents and chords. For example, the angle between a tangent and a chord is equal to the measure of the intercepted arc. Wait, specifically, the angle between tangent ML and chord LN would be half the measure of the intercepted arc LN. 

Wait, let me think again. The angle between tangent ML and chord LN at point L. Wait, no—the tangent is ML, so the angle between tangent ML and chord LN would be at point L. Wait, but in our case, the given angle is at point M: angle NML is 36 degrees. So angle at M between NM and LM. 

But how does that relate to arcs? Let me consider the tangent-secant angle theorem. The angle between a tangent and a chord is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc. However, in this case, angle at M is formed by tangent ML and secant MN? Wait, no. Wait, line MP is a secant. But where is point N located? 

Wait, the lines given are Line(M,L), Line(M,P), and Line(N,P). So line NP connects N and P. Also, point N is on the circle. 

So let me try to sketch this mentally. There's a circle with center B. Points N and P are on the circle. Point M is outside the circle. From M, there's a tangent ML touching the circle at L, and a secant going through M and P, which intersects the circle at P and possibly another point. Wait, but since MP is a secant, it should pass through two points on the circle. But since P is already on the circle, maybe the other intersection is another point. But the problem doesn't mention that. Alternatively, maybe the secant is from M through P, so P is one endpoint, and the other intersection could be another point. But without more info, maybe we can assume that MP is just a secant starting at M, passing through P, which is on the circle. 

But then, how do we connect these elements? 

Let me focus on the given angles. The angle at M between N and L is 36 degrees. So ∠NML = 36°. Another angle given is ∠NLBL = 78°, but wait, the angle is ∠N, L, B. So vertex at L, with sides LN and LB. Since B is the center, LB is a radius, and LN is a chord. So angle between chord LN and radius LB at point L. 

In circle geometry, the angle between a tangent and a chord is equal to the measure of the intercepted arc. Wait, but here we have an angle between a chord and a radius. Let me recall that the angle between a chord and a radius at the point of contact is equal to half the measure of the arc subtended by the chord. Wait, no. Let me think. If you have a radius BL and a chord LN, then the angle between them at point L would be... Well, the radius BL is perpendicular to the tangent at L. Wait, ML is the tangent. So ML is tangent at L, so ML ⊥ BL. Because the radius at the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent line. So BL is perpendicular to ML. 

Therefore, angle between BL and ML is 90 degrees. Now, angle NML is given as 36 degrees. Let me see. At point M, we have angle between NM and ML. So triangle NML? Wait, but we don't know about triangle NML yet. But maybe we can use some relations here. 

Alternatively, considering that angle between tangent ML and chord LN is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc LN. Wait, that's a standard theorem. The angle between a tangent and a chord is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc. So, in this case, angle at L between tangent ML and chord LN would be half the measure of arc LN. But wait, the angle is at point M. Wait, no. Wait, the angle between tangent ML and chord LN would be at point L. Wait, but here, the angle given is at point M. 

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the position. Let me rephrase. The angle between tangent ML and chord LN is at point L. However, the given angle is at point M between NM and ML. So maybe that's different. 

Alternatively, perhaps we can use power of a point. Since M is outside the circle, with tangent ML and secant MP. Power of point M gives ML² = MP * MA, where MA is the entire secant length. But I'm not sure if that helps directly with angles. 

But the given angles are at M and at L. Let me focus on the angle at M: ∠NML = 36°. Let me imagine triangle NML. We know that ML is tangent to the circle at L, so ML ⊥ BL. Also, since N is on the circle, and P is also on the circle, and line NP is connected. 

Another given angle is ∠NBL = 78°, where B is the center. Wait, ∠N, L, B is 78°, so that's angle at L between N and B. Which is angle N-L-B. Since B is the center, and N is on the circle, LB is a radius. So triangle NBL is a triangle with LB and BN as radii. Wait, BN is also a radius because N is on the circle. Therefore, triangle NBL is an isosceles triangle with LB = BN. Wait, but LB is a radius, and BN is a radius, so yes, LB = BN. Wait, but point N is on the circle, so BN is radius. So triangle NBL has sides LB and BN as radii, making it isosceles with base NL. Therefore, angles at N and L are equal? No, wait, in triangle NBL, sides LB and BN are equal. Therefore, angles opposite those sides are equal. Wait, side LB is opposite angle N, and side BN is opposite angle L. Wait, no. In triangle NBL, vertices are N, B, L. So side opposite angle N is BL, side opposite angle L is BN, and side opposite angle B is NL. Since LB and BN are both radii, they are equal. Therefore, angles opposite them would be equal. So angle at N (opposite BL) equals angle at L (opposite BN). Wait, but BL and BN are both radii, so BL = BN. Hence, angles opposite them are equal. So angle at N (angle at N in triangle NBL) equals angle at L (angle at L in triangle NBL). 

But the given angle is ∠N-L-B = 78°, which is angle at L. So angle at L in triangle NBL is 78°, so angle at N is also 78°, making the third angle at B equal to 180 - 78*2 = 180 - 156 = 24°. So angle at B in triangle NBL is 24°. 

But how does that help us? Well, angle at B is 24°, which is the central angle corresponding to arc NL. Because the central angle is equal to the measure of its arc. So arc NL measures 24°. 

Now, back to the angle at M: ∠NML = 36°. This angle is formed by tangent ML and secant MN. Wait, but MN isn't necessarily a secant. Wait, line NP is given, and point N is on the circle. But line MP is a secant, so it goes from M through P to another point. Wait, but how is N connected? 

Alternatively, maybe triangle NML is involved. Since ML is tangent at L, and N is on the circle. Let me consider the angle between tangent ML and chord LN. According to the tangent-chord angle theorem, that angle is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc. Wait, the angle between tangent ML and chord LN is equal to half the measure of the arc that's intercepted. 

But the angle in question here is ∠NML, which is at point M, not at point L. So that angle is formed by tangent ML and line MN. Wait, but MN is not necessarily a chord. Unless N is connected to M. 

Wait, line NP exists. So point N is connected to P. But how does N relate to M? Line NP is present, so maybe connecting N to P. But we need to figure out the relationship between N and M. 

Wait, the given lines are Line(M,L), Line(M,P), Line(N,P). So line NP connects N and P, and line MP connects M and P. So points M, P, N are connected via lines MP and NP. So triangle MNP? 

But how does this tie together? Let me try to piece it together. 

Since ML is tangent at L, and MP is a secant. So power of point M: ML² = MP * MQ, where Q is the second intersection of MP with the circle. But unless we know where Q is, maybe this isn't helpful immediately. 

Alternatively, focusing on the angles. We found earlier that arc NL is 24°, from the triangle NBL having angle at L of 78°, leading to arc NL being 24°. 

Then, looking at angle at M, ∠NML = 36°. How does that relate to arcs? 

There's a theorem that relates the angle between a tangent and a secant. Specifically, the measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a secant is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. 

Yes! The formula is: the measure of the angle is equal to half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. 

In this case, angle at M is formed by tangent ML and secant MN (assuming MN is the secant). Wait, but MN isn't explicitly stated as a secant. Wait, but line NP is present. Hmm. 

Wait, perhaps the angle at M (∠NML) is formed by tangent ML and secant MN. But we need to confirm if MN is a secant. Since N is on the circle, then line MN connects M (external point) to N (on the circle), so it's a secant. Wait, but a secant requires two points on the circle. So if line MN connects M to N, then since N is on the circle, but the other intersection would be... unless the line extends beyond N. Wait, but in this case, line MN would start at M, go through N, and exit the circle at N. But that's just a single point. Wait, no—a secant needs to enter and exit the circle. So if line MN starts at M (outside), passes through N (on the circle), then to be a secant, it should pass through another point. But unless there's another intersection. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is formed by tangent ML and secant MP. Wait, but MP is given as a secant. So angle between tangent ML and secant MP at point M. But the given angle is ∠NML, which involves point N, not P. So perhaps that's not directly applicable. 

Wait, but maybe we can find the measure of arc LP using the given angles. Let me think again. 

Earlier, we found arc NL is 24°. What about arc LP? The question is asking for mLP, which is the measure of arc LP. To find that, we might need to find the measure of arc NP or something else. 

Alternatively, since we have angle at L between N and B (which is 78°), which helped us get arc NL. 

Also, since point P is on the circle, and line MP is a secant. So if we can find the measure of arc NP or something related, maybe we can combine with other arcs. 

Wait, let me consider the angle at M, ∠NML = 36°. Using the tangent-secant angle theorem, which states that the measure of the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. 

The angle between tangent ML and secant MN is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs would be the arc from N to L (the one not containing the other points) and the arc from N to the other intersection point. Wait, but since ML is tangent at L, and MN is a secant from M through N to the circle, which is just N itself. Wait, but that seems like a tangent. Wait, no—if MN is a secant, then it should intersect the circle at two points. But since N is on the circle, and M is outside, then the secant would go from M through N and exit the circle at another point. But unless there's another intersection. However, the problem statement mentions that MP is a secant, not MN. So maybe the angle at M is formed by tangent ML and secant MP. 

Wait, the angle given is ∠NML, which is at point M between N and L. So that would be between line MN and ML. So if ML is tangent and MN is a secant, then yes, that angle is formed by tangent ML and secant MN. 

So applying the tangent-secant angle theorem, the measure of ∠NML is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs would be the arc from N to L (not containing the other points) and the arc from N to the other intersection point of secant MN. Wait, but since MN is a secant, it would intersect the circle at two points. One is N, and the other would be another point. Let me call that point Q. So the angle at M is formed by tangent ML and secant MQ, where Q is the second intersection of line MN with the circle. 

But since we don't know where Q is, maybe we can express the angle in terms of arcs. The formula is: measure of angle = ½ (measure of larger arc - measure of smaller arc). 

But in this case, the intercepted arcs are arc NL and arc NQ, depending on direction. Wait, but since ML is tangent at L, the angle is formed by tangent ML and secant MN. Therefore, the angle is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs would be arc from N to L (the arc that's cut off by the tangent and the secant). Wait, actually, according to the theorem, the measure is half the difference between the intercepted arc that's far away and the near arc. 

Specifically, the angle formed by a tangent and a secant is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. So, if the tangent is at point L, and the secant passes through N and another point, say Q, then the angle at M would be ½ (arc LQ - arc LN). 

But in this case, the secant MN passes through N, which is on the circle. So if the secant MN starts at M, goes through N, and exits the circle at N, then that suggests that MN is actually tangent? No, because if it's a secant, it should intersect at two points. So maybe there's another point where line MN intersects the circle besides N. 

Alternatively, maybe line MN intersects the circle only at N, making it a tangent. But that contradicts the fact that it's a secant. 

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I made a wrong assumption earlier. Let me check again. 

The problem says: Secant(Line(M,P),Circle(B)). So line MP is a secant, which means it intersects the circle at two points. Since P is on the circle, the other intersection point could be another point, say R. So line MP intersects the circle at R and P. 

But how does this relate to the angle at M? The angle given is ∠NML, which is between N-M-L. So that angle is formed by lines MN and ML. So ML is tangent at L, and MN is a line from M to N. But N is on the circle, so MN is a secant if it intersects the circle at two points. However, since N is on the circle, MN would be a secant if it enters the circle at another point. 

Assuming that line MN passes through N and another point on the circle, say Q. Then the angle at M between ML (tangent at L) and MN (secant passing through N and Q) would be ½ (arc LQ - arc LN). 

But without knowing where Q is, this might not help. However, we might have other information. 

Earlier, we determined that arc NL is 24°, from the triangle NBL. So if we can find arc LQ or something else, we can relate it to the given angle of 36°. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Since we have angle at L of 78°, which gave us arc NL as 24°, and angle at M of 36°, which may relate to other arcs. 

Wait, let's suppose that the angle at M (∠NML = 36°) is formed by tangent ML and secant MN. Applying the theorem, this angle is ½ (arc LN - arc ... ?). Wait, the formula is angle = ½ (difference of intercepted arcs). The intercepted arcs are those intercepted by the tangent and the secant. 

The tangent touches at L, and the secant passes through N and another point. So the intercepted arcs would be the arc from L to N (not containing the other points) and the arc from L to the other intersection point of the secant. 

But since we don't know the other intersection point, maybe we need to consider that the secant MN passes through N and another point. Suppose the other intersection is Q, then angle at M would be ½ (arc LQ - arc LN). 

But unless we have more info, this might not be solvable. Maybe there's another approach. 

Looking back, we know arc NL is 24°, and we need arc LP. Perhaps there's a relation between arc NL, arc LP, and other arcs. 

Also, note that point P is on the circle, and line MP is a secant. So if we can find the measure of arc NP, then maybe combining with other arcs. 

Wait, let's consider triangle NBP. Since B is the center, NB and BP are radii. So triangle NBP is isosceles with NB = BP. Therefore, angles at N and P are equal. But I don't know if that helps yet. 

Alternatively, since we have angle at L of 78°, which was part of triangle NBL, giving us arc NL as 24°, and we need arc LP. 

Maybe if we can find the measure of arc NP, then subtract arc NL (24°) to get arc LP. 

To find arc NP, we might need to look at other angles. 

Alternatively, consider the full circle. The total circumference is 360°, so sum of all arcs is 360°. If we can find other arcs, we can compute arc LP. 

But without more information, this might not be straightforward. 

Wait, what about the angle at M of 36°? Let me try to apply the tangent-secant theorem again. 

Angle at M between tangent ML and secant MN is 36°, so this equals ½ (arc LN - arc LQ), where Q is the other intersection of secant MN with the circle. Assuming that arc LQ is the major arc or minor arc depending on the diagram. 

But without knowing where Q is, it's hard to proceed. However, if we assume that the secant MN intersects the circle at N and another point, say Q, then arc LN and arc LQ would be related. 

But since we don't have information about Q, maybe there's another way. 

Wait, what if the secant MN is actually the same as MP? Wait, MP is a secant, and line MP goes from M through P. If line MN is the same as MP, then point N is on line MP. Wait, but N is on the circle, and P is also on the circle. So if N and P are both on line MP, then points N and P are on the same line MP. Thus, line NP is the same as line MP. So point N is on line MP, and point P is also on line MP. Therefore, points M, N, P are colinear with N between M and P, or P between M and N. 

Wait, but if line MP is a secant, then it passes through M (external), enters the circle at one point, then exits at another. Since P is on the circle, the secant MP enters at P and exits at another point. But if N is also on line MP, then N could be the other intersection point. So line MP passes through M, then intersects the circle at N and P. So the order is M---N----P or M----P----N. Depending on where N is. 

This changes things. So line MP is a secant, passing through M, entering the circle at N, exiting at P. Or vice versa. 

So, assuming that, then angle at M between ML (tangent) and MN (part of secant MP) would be formed. 

Thus, applying the tangent-secant angle theorem: ∠NML = ½ (arc NL - arc NP). Wait, no. The intercepted arcs are the arc between the points where the secant and tangent meet. 

Wait, the angle between tangent ML and secant MN (which is part of secant MP) would intercept arcs from L to N and from L to P. Wait, no. The intercepted arcs are those arcs that are intercepted by the tangent and the secant. 

Actually, the formula is: the measure of the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are the arc between the points where the secant intersects the circle (which are N and P) and the arc between the tangent point (L) and the secant. 

Wait, the angle is formed by tangent ML and secant MN. The secant MN passes through N and P. So the intercepted arcs would be arc from N to P (the arc that's cut by the secant) and arc from L to N. 

Wait, no. Let me refer to the standard theorem. The measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a secant is equal to half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. 

The intercepted arcs are the arc that's inside the angle (between the tangent and the secant) and the arc that's outside. Wait, more precisely, the angle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. 

For instance, if the tangent is at point L and the secant passes through N and P, then the intercepted arcs are the arc from L to N and the arc from L to P. Wait, but the angle is formed by the tangent and the secant, so the intercepted arcs are the arc between L and N (which is the arc that's closer to the angle) and the arc between L and P (which is the arc farther from the angle). 

Wait, no. Actually, it's the difference between the arc that is intercepted by the secant and the arc that is intercepted by the tangent. 

Wait, I think I need to clarify. The angle formed by a tangent and a secant is equal to half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are the arc between the points where the secant intersects the circle and the arc between the tangent point and the secant. 

Wait, more accurately, the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs that are opposite each other. 

In this case, the tangent at L and the secant passing through N and P. The intercepted arcs would be arc NP (the arc between the two points of the secant) and arc LN (from tangent point L to one of the secant points). 

Wait, no. Let me look up the exact theorem. 

According to the Tangent-Secant Angle Theorem: the measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a secant drawn from a point outside the circle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. 

The formula is: measure of angle = ½ (measure of larger arc - measure of smaller arc). 

In this case, the angle at M is formed by tangent ML and secant MP (since MN is part of MP). The intercepted arcs are arc LP and arc LN. 

Wait, let me define the intercepted arcs properly. The angle is formed by the tangent ML and the secant MP. The intercepted arcs are the arc from L to P (passing through the side of the angle) and the arc from L to N (passing through the other side). Wait, no. Actually, the intercepted arcs are the arc between the tangent point and the secant's first intersection, and the arc between the tangent point and the sec other intersection. 

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the two arcs intercepted by the secant and tangent. 

Since the tangent is at L, and the secant passes through N and P, the intercepted arcs are the arc from L to N and the arc from L to P. But depending on the position, the angle is half the difference between the arcs. 

However, without knowing whether the arc is major or minor, it's tricky. But since the angle is 36°, which is positive, it must be that the larger arc minus the smaller arc divided by 2 gives 36°. 

Assume that the angle is formed such that the intercepted arcs are arc LP and arc LN. Then, the measure of ∠NML is ½(arc LP - arc LN). 

We know arc LN is 24°, from earlier. So if we can find arc LP, we can set up the equation. 

Let me denote arc LP as x. Then:

36 = ½(x - 24)

Multiply both sides by 2:

72 = x - 24

x = 96°

So arc LP would be 96°. 

But wait, the question asks for mLP, which is the measure of arc LP. So the answer would be 96°. But none of the options are 96. Wait, the options are A. 114, B. 144, C. 150, D. 156. 

Hmm, that suggests I might have made a mistake. Let me double-check. 

First, arc NL is 24°, which came from the triangle NBL where angle at L was 78°, leading to arc NL being 24°. Is that accurate?

In triangle NBL, with B as the center, LB and BN are radii. The angle at L is 78°, so the other angles in triangle NBL: since LB=BN, triangle is isosceles with LB=BN. Therefore, angles at N and L are equal? Wait, no. Wait, in triangle NBL, sides LB and BN are equal. So the angles opposite them are equal. 

Wait, side LB is opposite angle N, and side BN is opposite angle L. Wait, no. Let me label the triangle properly. Triangle NBL has vertices N, B, L. Side opposite angle N is BL. Side opposite angle L is BN. Side opposite angle B is NL. 

Since LB and BN are both radii, so LB = BN. Therefore, angles opposite them are equal. So angle at N (opposite BL) equals angle at L (opposite BN). Given that angle at L is 78°, then angle at N is also 78°, making angle at B equal to 180 - 78 - 78 = 24°. 

Yes, that's correct. Therefore, angle at B is 24°, which is the central angle over arc NL. So arc NL is 24°, correct. 

Then, using the tangent-secant angle theorem: ∠NML = ½ (arc LP - arc LN). 

Assuming that the angle is formed by tangent ML and secant MP, which passes through N and P. Wait, but if the secant passes through N and P, then the intercepted arcs are arc NP and arc NL? Or arc LP and arc LN? 

Wait, the intercepted arcs depend on which arcs are cut by the tangent and secant. The angle is formed by tangent ML and secant MP. The intercepted arcs are the arcs that are intercepted by the secant and the tangent. 

Since the secant passes through N and P, and the tangent is at L, the intercepted arcs are the arc from L to N (which is arc LN) and the arc from L to P (which is arc LP). But since the angle is formed outside the circle, the formula uses the difference between the intercepted arcs. 

But which arc is larger? Arc LP or arc LN? If the angle is formed by the tangent and secant, then the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Typically, it's the larger arc minus the smaller arc. 

Assuming that arc LP is the larger arc. So:

∠NML = ½ (arc LP - arc LN) => 36 = ½ (x - 24), leading to x = 96°. 

But 96° isn't among the answer choices. So either my assumption is wrong, or there's a mistake in the reasoning. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is formed by the secant and tangent, and the intercepted arcs are arc NP and arc NL. Let me think again. 

The angle at M is between ML (tangent) and MP (secant). The secant MP intersects the circle at N and P. So the intercepted arcs are arc NP and arc NL. Wait, but how? 

Wait, the intercepted arcs are the arc that's between the points where the secant and tangent touch. Since the tangent is at L, and the secant passes through N and P. So the intercepted arcs are arc LP (from L to P) and arc LN (from L to N)? Or arc NP and arc NL?

Actually, the correct intercepted arcs for the angle formed by tangent ML and secant MP are the arc between L and N (which is arc LN) and the arc between L and P (which is arc LP). But since the angle is outside the circle, it's the difference between the intercepted arc that's opposite the angle and the arc that's adjacent. 

Wait, I think I need to recall the exact wording. The measure of the angle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are the arc that's "cut" by the two lines forming the angle. 

In this case, the angle is formed by the tangent ML and the secant MP. The secant MP passes through N and P. So the intercepted arcs are the arc from L to N (intercepted by the tangent and the secant) and the arc from L to P (intercepted by the tangent and the secant)? Not sure. 

Alternatively, the intercepted arcs are the arc between N and P (the arc that the secant cuts) and the arc between L and the other intersection point. Wait, this is confusing. 

Let me search for an alternative approach. 

We know arc NL is 24°. Let me consider the total circle. If I can find other arcs, maybe I can find arc LP. 

Suppose the angle at M is 36°, and we want to relate it to other arcs. Let me consider the power of point M. 

Power of M with respect to circle B is ML² = MN * MP. 

But without knowing lengths, this might not help directly. 

Alternatively, let's consider triangle MNL. We know angle at M is 36°, and ML is tangent at L. So ML ⊥ BL. 

From earlier, we had in triangle NBL, angle at B is 24°, which corresponds to arc NL being 24°. 

Now, if we can find angle at N in triangle MNL, or other angles, maybe we can relate it to arcs. 

But without more info, this is challenging. 

Wait, perhaps there's another angle given: ∠NBL = 78°, which we've used. 

Wait, what is the measure of angle at B? It's 24°, which is the central angle for arc NL. 

What about angle at N? In triangle NBL, it's 78°, which is the angle at N between points B and L. 

Now, if we consider line NP, since N and P are on the circle, and B is the center. So line NP is a chord. 

The angle at N between points P and B is part of triangle NBP, which is isosceles with NB = BP. 

But we don't know the measure of angle at N or P in triangle NBP. 

Alternatively, maybe we can find the measure of arc NP. 

If we can find the measure of arc NP, then since arc NL is 24°, we can find arc LP by subtracting or adding. 

But how? 

Wait, if we can find the measure of angle at M between ML and MP, which is 36°, and relate it to arc NP. 

Wait, earlier calculation suggested that angle at M is ½ (arc LP - arc LN) = 36°, leading to arc LP = 96°, but that's not matching the options. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is ½ (arc NP - arc NL). Let's try that. 

Assume ∠NML = ½ (arc NP - arc NL) = 36°. 

Then, 36 = ½ (arc NP - 24) → arc NP - 24 = 72 → arc NP = 96°. 

Then, arc LP would be arc NP - arc NL = 96 - 24 = 72°, but this is still not matching the options. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is ½ (arc LP + arc LN) = 36°, but that would imply arc LP + 24 = 72 → arc LP = 48°, also not matching. 

Hmm. 

Perhaps there's an error in identifying the intercepted arcs. Let me think differently. 

Since ML is tangent at L, and MP is secant passing through N and P. So the angle at M is between tangent ML and secant MP. 

The intercepted arcs are the arc from L to P (not containing N) and the arc from L to N (which is 24°). 

But the angle is formed outside the circle, so the measure is ½ (larger arc LP - smaller arc LN). 

If arc LP is the larger arc, then 36 = ½ (arc LP - 24) → arc LP = 96°, as before. 

But 96° is not among the options. So either this approach is incorrect, or there's another arc to consider. 

Wait, maybe the angle at M is formed by tangent ML and secant MN, where N is on the circle. So the intercepted arcs are arc from L to N (24°) and arc from L to the other intersection of secant MN with the circle. But if line MN intersects the circle at N and another point Q, then the angle would be ½ (arc LQ - arc LN). 

But since we don't know where Q is, this might not help. 

Wait, but if line MN is the same as line MP, then Q is P. So the angle is between tangent ML and secant MP, passing through N and P. So the intercepted arcs are arc LP and arc LN. 

But if arc LP is the arc from L to P, passing through the side of the angle, and arc LN is the other arc. 

But without knowing the exact position, it's ambiguous. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is formed by the tangent and the secant, and the intercepted arcs are arc NP and arc NL. 

Wait, if the angle is formed by tangent ML and secant MP, then the intercepted arcs are arc NP (the arc between the secant's two points) and arc NL (the arc between tangent point and secant). 

But then, the formula would be ½ (arc NP - arc NL) = 36°. 

So, arc NP - arc NL = 72°. 

We know arc NL is 24°, so arc NP = 72 + 24 = 96°. 

Now, arc NP is 96°, and we need arc LP. 

How to find arc LP? 

Well, if we can find the measure of arc NP, and knowing that the total circle is 360°, but without knowing other arcs, it's difficult. 

But we also have point B as the center, and angle at L of 78°. 

Wait, let's think about triangle NLP. But I don't know if that helps. 

Alternatively, since we have arc NL = 24°, arc NP = 96°, then arc LP would be arc NP - arc NL = 96 - 24 = 72°, but again, this isn't matching the options. 

Alternatively, if arc LP is the rest of the circle. 

Wait, if arc NP is 96°, and arc NL is 24°, then depending on their positions. 

If arc NL is 24°, and arc NP is 96°, then the position of P relative to L and N matters. 

Assuming that points L, N, and P are arranged on the circle such that arc NL is 24°, and arc NP is 96°, then arc LP would be arc NP - arc NL = 96 - 24 = 72°. 

Still not matching. 

Alternatively, if arc LP is the major arc, then it would be 360 - 72 = 288°, which is too large. 

This suggests that my initial approach might be missing something. 

Let me revisit the angle at L, which was 78°. This angle is ∠N-L-B, which is angle at L between N and B. Since B is the center, this is angle between LN and LB. As we said earlier, this is 78°, and since LB is a radius, and LN is a chord. 

In triangle NBL, we found angle at B is 24°, which is the central angle for arc NL, hence arc NL is 24°. 

Now, let's consider the angle at M, which is 36°, and think about other angles. 

Maybe there's a cyclic quadrilateral or some other relationship. 

Alternatively, consider triangle MLP. We know ML is tangent at L, so ML ⊥ BL. 

If we can find some right angles or other angles in this triangle. 

But without more information, it's hard to proceed. 

Wait, what if we consider the inscribed angle theorem? For example, if there's an inscribed angle subtending arc LP. 

But how to relate it to the given angles. 

Alternatively, let's consider the full circle. If we can find the measure of arc LP, we can use the fact that the sum of all arcs is 360°. 

We know arc NL is 24°, and if we can find arc NP, then arc LP would be arc NP - arc NL, or something like that. 

But how to find arc NP? 

Wait, let's consider the angle at B, which is 24° for arc NL. What about other central angles? 

If we can find the measure of angle at B for arc NP, then arc NP would be equal to that angle. 

But how to find that angle? 

Let me consider triangle NBP. Since B is the center, NB and BP are radii. So triangle NBP is isosceles with NB = BP. 

If we can find the measure of angle at B in triangle NBP, then arc NP would be twice that angle. 

But how to find that angle? 

We know that line NP is present, and point L is on the circle. Maybe there's a relationship between angles at L and B. 

Wait, angle at L is 78°, which is ∠N-L-B. This is angle between LN and LB. 

If we can relate this to other angles. 

Let me consider extending some lines or finding other triangles. 

Alternatively, since ML is tangent at L, and ML ⊥ BL, we can find some right triangles. 

In triangle MLB, right-angled at L, because ML is tangent and BL is radius. 

But we don't know any lengths, so this might not help. 

Wait, but if we can find some angles in this triangle. 

We know angle at M is 36°, and angle at L is 90°, so angle at B would be 180 - 36 - 90 = 54°. 

Wait, but angle at B in triangle MLB is angle at B between M and L. But B is the center, so this would be angle MBL. 

But how does this relate to arc NL? 

Wait, angle MBL is an angle at the center, but it's not necessarily related to arc NL. 

Wait, if angle at M is 36°, angle at L is 90°, then angle at B is 54°. So angle MBL = 54°. 

This angle MBL is at the center, so it would correspond to arc ML? No, because ML is a tangent, not a chord. 

Wait, but ML is a tangent, so the angle at B between M and L is not directly an arc. 

But this angle MBL is 54°, which might relate to other arcs. 

But I'm not sure how to use this. 

Alternatively, since angle at M is 36°, and angle at L is 90°, and angle at B is 54°, perhaps this forms some relationship with other parts of the circle. 

But this seems too vague. 

At this point, I might have to reconsider the earlier approach where arc LP is 96°, even though it's not in the options. But since the options are A. 114, B. 144, C. 150, D. 156, perhaps there's a miscalculation. 

Wait, let me check the tangent-secant angle theorem again. 

The formula is: measure of angle = ½ (measure of intercepted arc - measure of non-intercepted arc). 

Wait, sometimes it's the other way around. Maybe it's ½ (measure of the intercepted arc that is farther from the angle minus the nearer arc). 

In this case, if the angle is formed by tangent ML and secant MP, the intercepted arcs are arc LP (farther) and arc LN (nearer). So the angle is ½ (arc LP - arc LN) = 36°. 

So, arc LP = 36 * 2 + arc LN = 72 + 24 = 96°. 

But this is not in the options. 

Wait, but maybe the angle is formed by the tangent and the secant, and the intercepted arcs are arc NP and arc NL. 

So, angle at M is ½ (arc NP - arc NL) = 36°. 

So, arc NP = 72 + 24 = 96°. 

Then, arc LP would be arc NP - arc NL = 96 - 24 = 72°, but this is also not matching. 

Alternatively, if arc NP is 96°,
