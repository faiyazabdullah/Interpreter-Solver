====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a triangle ABC, right? And some given conditions. Let me start by writing down all the given information.

First, there's a RightAngle predicate for Angle(A,C,B). Wait, so angle at point C between points A, C, B? That means angle ACB is a right angle. So triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at C. Got it.

Then, the lengths: LengthOf(Line(A,B)) is 42, LengthOf(Line(B,C)) is 38, and LengthOf(Line(A,C)) is x. We need to find x. Also, Triangle(A,B,C) is given, which confirms it's a triangle.

So since it's a right-angled triangle at C, the sides AB, BC, and AC form a right triangle. Wait, but in a right-angled triangle, the Pythagorean theorem applies. The hypotenuse would be the side opposite the right angle. Since the right angle is at C, the hypotenuse should be AB. Therefore, AB² = AC² + BC². 

Wait, let me confirm that. In triangle ABC, right-angled at C, so sides AC and BC are the legs, and AB is the hypotenuse. Therefore, AB squared equals AC squared plus BC squared. 

Given that AB is 42, BC is 38, and AC is x. So substituting the values into the equation:

AB² = AC² + BC²  
=> 42² = x² + 38²  
Therefore, x² = 42² - 38²  

Let me compute that. First, calculate 42 squared. 42*42 is 1764. Then 38 squared is 1444. Subtracting those gives 1764 - 1444 = 320. So x² = 320. Taking square root of both sides, x = sqrt(320).

Now simplify sqrt(320). Let's factor 320. 320 = 64 * 5. Because 64*5=320. So sqrt(64*5)=sqrt(64)*sqrt(5)=8*sqrt(5). Therefore, x=8√5.

Looking at the answer choices, option C is 8√5. So the answer should be C.

Wait, let me check again if I got the hypotenuse right. Since the right angle is at C, the hypotenuse is indeed AB. So yes, AB is the hypotenuse, so the calculation holds. Therefore, x is sqrt(42² - 38²) = sqrt(320) = 8√5. Yep, that seems correct. So the answer is C.
