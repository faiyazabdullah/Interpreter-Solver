Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points X, A, Q, D, T, E. There are several lines mentioned: Line(X,A), Line(X,T), Line(X,E). Also, there's a circle centered at A? Wait, the predicate says Circle(A), so maybe point A is the center of a circle. Then there are right angles at points Q, A, D; Q, E, D; and Q, T, D. Hmm. 

The question asks for T X, given that E X is 24 and D E is 7. The options are A.7, B.24, C.25, D.32. Let me start by visualizing the diagram based on the given predicates.

First, since there are right angles at QAD, QED, and QTD, that suggests that QA is perpendicular to AD, QE is perpendicular to ED, and QT is perpendicular to TD. Wait, but how do these points relate? Let me note down the points and lines again.

Points involved: X connected to A, T, E. So point X has three lines going out to A, T, E. Then Q is another point, connected to D via a line. Also, there are three right angles involving Q and D. So maybe Q is a common vertex where those right angles occur?

Let me think about each right angle. For Angle(Q, A, D) being a right angle means that QA is perpendicular to AD. Similarly, Angle(Q, E, D) implies QE is perpendicular to ED. And Angle(Q, T, D) means QT is perpendicular to TD. So, all three segments QA, QE, QT are perpendicular to different lines AD, ED, TD respectively. But since they all share point Q, perhaps Q is a point such that QA, QE, QT are all perpendicular to different lines emanating from D? Or maybe D is a common point where those lines meet?

Wait, the lines are AD, ED, TD. So D is connected to A, E, T. So D is connected to three other points: A, E, T. And Q is connected to D. Also, QA, QE, QT are each perpendicular to AD, ED, TD respectively. That seems like Q is forming right angles with those lines. Maybe Q is the orthocenter or something? Not sure yet.

But let's focus on coordinates. Since there are right angles, maybe coordinate geometry could help here. Let me assign coordinates to some points to make it easier.

Let’s assume D is at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, since QA is perpendicular to AD, and assuming AD is a horizontal line (since QA is perpendicular), maybe I can set up coordinates accordingly.

Wait, but first, let me consider the right angles. Let me take Angle(Q, A, D) being a right angle. That would mean that at point A, the angle between QA and AD is 90 degrees. Wait, no—angle QAD means at point A, between points Q, A, D. Wait, no—the angle is at point A? No, the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(Q, A, D) is the angle at point A between points Q, A, D. Wait, no—that would be angle at A formed by AQ and AD. So AQ and AD are perpendicular. So AQ ⊥ AD.

Similarly, Angle(Q, E, D) is the angle at E between Q, E, D. So QE ⊥ ED. And Angle(Q, T, D) is angle at T between Q, T, D. So QT ⊥ TD.

So, for example, QA is perpendicular to AD, QE is perpendicular to ED, QT is perpendicular to TD. Now, since AD is connected to D and A, ED connects E and D, TD connects T and D.

Also, X is connected to A, T, E. So X is connected to three points: A, T, E. Therefore, X is a point connected to A, T, E. So maybe X is the intersection point of lines AT, AE, and XT? Wait, no. Lines XA, XT, and XE are given. So X is connected to A, T, and E via straight lines. So X is a single point connected to three other points.

Now, since there's a circle with center at A (Circle(A)), so the circle is centered at point A. Also, there are right angles involving Q, A, D, etc. Maybe Q lies on the circle? Not sure yet.

Given that, let me try to sketch this mentally. Let me assign coordinates. Let me place D at (0,0). Suppose AD is along the x-axis. Let me say A is at (a, 0), so AD is from A(a,0) to D(0,0). Since QA is perpendicular to AD, which is horizontal, so QA must be vertical. So QA is a vertical line from A(a,0). Since angle at A is right, so QA is vertical upwards or downwards. Let me choose direction. Let's say QA goes upward, so Q is somewhere along the vertical line passing through A. So Q has coordinates (a, q_y).

Then, since QE is perpendicular to ED. ED is from E to D(0,0). Let me denote E as some point. Let me think. Also, D E is given as 7 units. So DE = 7. So distance from D(0,0) to E is 7. Let me suppose E is at (e_x, e_y), so sqrt(e_x² + e_y²) = 7. Also, QE is perpendicular to ED. The vector ED is from E to D: (-e_x, -e_y). So the direction of ED is towards D from E. The line QE is perpendicular to ED, so the slope of QE multiplied by the slope of ED should be -1.

Alternatively, since QE is perpendicular to ED, then QE is the altitude from Q to ED. Wait, but Q is already defined in relation to A and D. This seems getting complicated. Maybe coordinate system assignment is the way to go.

Let me proceed step by step.

Set D at (0,0). Let me define AD as along x-axis. Let me assume A is at (a, 0), so AD is from A(a,0) to D(0,0). Then QA is perpendicular to AD, so QA is vertical. Therefore, Q has same x-coordinate as A. So Q is at (a, k) for some k.

Now, considering angle QED is a right angle. So QE is perpendicular to ED. Let me find coordinates for E. Let me denote E as (x, y). Then ED is the vector from E to D: (0 - x, 0 - y) = (-x, -y). The line QE goes from Q(a, k) to E(x, y). The direction of QE is (x - a, y - k). For QE to be perpendicular to ED, their dot product must be zero:

(-x)(x - a) + (-y)(y - k) = 0  
=> -x(x - a) - y(y - k) = 0  
=> -x² + a x - y² + k y = 0  
=> a x + k y = x² + y²  

Hmm, that's one equation relating x, y, a, k.

Also, DE = 7. Since D is (0,0) and E is (x,y), then √(x² + y²) = 7 ⇒ x² + y² = 49.

Substituting into previous equation:

a x + k y = 49.

So that gives us a relationship between a, k, x, y.

Now, moving to the third right angle: Angle(Q, T, D) is a right angle. So QT is perpendicular to TD. TD is the vector from T to D. Let me denote T as (p, r). Then TD is (0 - p, 0 - r) = (-p, -r). QT is the vector from Q(a,k) to T(p,r): (p - a, r - k). Their dot product must be zero:

(-p)(p - a) + (-r)(r - k) = 0  
⇒ -p² + a p - r² + k r = 0  
⇒ a p + k r = p² + r².

Additionally, since X is connected to A, T, E. So X is a point connected to A(a,0), T(p,r), and E(x,y). So X lies on lines XA, XT, and XE. Wait, but how does that work? If X is connected to A, T, E, then X is a common point connected to those three points. So lines XA, XT, XE are all lines starting from X to those respective points. So X is a point such that lines from X to A, X to T, and X to E exist. So X could be the intersection of those lines, but without more info, it's hard to tell.

But the question asks for TX, given that EX = 24 and DE = 7.

We need to find TX. Given that EX is 24, so the distance between X and E is 24. So if E is (x,y), then X is some point (let's call it (m,n)) such that √[(m - x)^2 + (n - y)^2] = 24.

But how to relate this with other elements?

This seems too abstract. Maybe there's a better approach. Let me recall that there's also a circle centered at A. So the circle with center A(a,0) and radius... Well, unless specified otherwise, maybe the radius isn't directly given. However, since Q is part of the setup, maybe Q lies on the circle?

Wait, the predicate is Circle(A), which usually denotes a circle with center A. But without radius given, it's unclear. Unless there's more info. Alternatively, maybe Q is on the circle? Because if QA is perpendicular to AD, and A is the center of the circle, then QA could be a radius? Wait, if Q is on the circle centered at A, then QA would be a radius. But QA is perpendicular to AD. So if QA is a radius, then AD is tangent to the circle at A? Wait, no. If QA is perpendicular to AD, then AD is perpendicular to QA, implying that AD is tangent to the circle at A? But tangents are perpendicular to radii. So if AD is tangent to the circle at A, then yes. But AD starts at A, so if AD is tangent to the circle at A, then AD would be along the tangent line at A. Which would mean that AD is perpendicular to the radius QA. Which matches our earlier conclusion. So that suggests that AD is tangent to the circle centered at A, which is trivial because the tangent at A would be any line perpendicular to the radius QA. Hence, this makes sense.

Therefore, Q is a point on the circle centered at A, since QA is a radius. Therefore, the length QA is equal to the radius of the circle. But we don't know the radius. However, this might connect with other parts.

Now, returning to the right angles. We had earlier equations for E and T. Let me see if I can find relations between variables.

From DE = 7, we have x² + y² = 49.

For E, the equation from perpendicularity was a x + k y = 49.

Similarly, for T, we have a p + k r = p² + r².

But how do these relate to X?

X is connected to A, T, E. So lines XA, XT, XE. Let me assume that X is the intersection point of lines XT and XE? Wait, no. Since X is connected to A, T, and E, it's a single point connected to all three. So X is a point such that lines from X to A, X to T, and X to E exist. But without knowing where X is, it's hard to proceed. Perhaps there's a property or theorem that applies here.

Alternatively, since there are three right angles at Q, maybe Q is the orthocenter or some other notable point. Alternatively, since QA, QE, QT are all perpendicular to AD, ED, TD respectively, which are lines from D to A, E, T. So perhaps D is a common point, and QA, QE, QT are altitudes or something?

Wait, considering that QA is perpendicular to AD, which is a line from A to D. Similarly, QE is perpendicular to ED (from E to D), and QT is perpendicular to TD (from T to D). So each of these segments QA, QE, QT are perpendicular to the lines connecting D to A, E, T respectively. So Q is a point such that QA is perpendicular to DA, QE is perpendicular to DE, and QT is perpendicular to DT. Therefore, Q is the foot of perpendiculars from Q onto DA, DE, DT? No, wait. Actually, QA is perpendicular to DA, which means that Q lies on the line perpendicular to DA at point A. Wait, no—if QA is perpendicular to DA, then the line QA is perpendicular to DA. So DA is a line segment from D to A. The line QA is perpendicular to DA at point A? Or just that QA is perpendicular to DA regardless of where Q is?

Actually, the angle at A between Q and D is a right angle. So the lines AQ and AD are perpendicular. So AQ is perpendicular to AD, meaning that line AQ is perpendicular to line AD. Therefore, line AQ is the line that passes through A and is perpendicular to AD. Since AD is from A to D, which in our coordinate system was along the x-axis from A(a,0) to D(0,0). So AD is horizontal. Thus, AQ is vertical. Hence, Q lies along the vertical line passing through A. As before, Q is at (a, k).

Now, since there's a circle centered at A, and Q is on that circle (as QA is a radius), so QA is the radius. Therefore, the length QA is equal to the radius. Let me denote the radius as r. So |QA| = r. But without knowing the radius, it's still abstract.

But maybe we can use the fact that QE is perpendicular to ED. Earlier, we found that for E, the equation a x + k y = 49. Also, since E lies on the circle? Not necessarily. But maybe not. Wait, but DE is 7, which we've used.

Similarly for T, we have a p + k r = p² + r².

Now, considering X is connected to A, T, E. So X is a point such that lines XA, XT, and XE exist. But how can we find TX?

Alternatively, since EX = 24 and DE = 7, maybe we can use some triangle relations. Let me think about triangle EXD or something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe triangle XDE? But we know DE = 7 and EX = 24. If we can find XD, then we can use Pythagoras or something. But how?

Alternatively, since we have right angles at Q, maybe there's a way to connect Q with X.

Wait, X is connected to A, T, and E. Let me think about the possibility that X lies on the circle centered at A. If X is on the circle, then AX would be a radius. But we don't know if that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe X is the orthocenter or centroid of some triangle. But without more info, it's hard to say.

Another thought: since there are three right angles involving Q, and X is connected to A, T, E, maybe there's a relation between X and Q. But I'm not seeing it immediately.

Wait, let me consider coordinates again. Let me try assigning specific coordinates to simplify.

Let me fix D at (0,0). Let me assume AD is along x-axis. Let me set A at (a, 0). Since QA is perpendicular to AD, which is horizontal, so QA is vertical. So Q is at (a, b) for some b. 

Now, for E, since DE=7, let me assume E is at (c, d) such that c² + d² = 49. Also, QE is perpendicular to ED. Vector ED is from E to D: (-c, -d). Vector QE is from Q(a,b) to E(c,d): (c - a, d - b). Dot product is zero:

(-c)(c - a) + (-d)(d - b) = 0  
→ -c² + a c - d² + b d = 0  
→ a c + b d = c² + d²  
But c² + d² = 49 → a c + b d = 49.

Similarly for T: Let T be at (e, f). Then vector TD is (-e, -f). Vector QT is (e - a, f - b). Dot product:

(-e)(e - a) + (-f)(f - b) = 0  
→ -e² + a e - f² + b f = 0  
→ a e + b f = e² + f².

Now, X is connected to A(a,0), T(e,f), and E(c,d). Let me assume X is some point (m,n). Then:

Distance EX = 24 → √[(m - c)^2 + (n - d)^2] = 24 → (m - c)^2 + (n - d)^2 = 576.

But we need to find TX, which is √[(m - e)^2 + (n - f)^2]. 

But how to relate m and n with other variables?

Perhaps there's a relation between X, A, T, E. Since X is connected to all three, maybe X lies at the intersection of lines TA, TE, and EA? Wait, but X is a single point connected to them, so it's likely that X is the intersection point of lines joining these points. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging.

Alternatively, maybe X is the orthocenter or something related to triangle TED or something. But again, not sure.

Wait, but there's also the circle centered at A. If X lies on that circle, then AX would be equal to the radius. But we don't know the radius. However, if QA is a radius, then QA = radius. So QA = √[(a - a)^2 + (b - 0)^2] = |b|. So the radius is |b|. Therefore, any point on the circle centered at A would satisfy (x - a)^2 + (y - 0)^2 = b^2.

Now, if X is on this circle, then (m - a)^2 + n^2 = b^2. But we don't know b. However, perhaps X is related to Q somehow?

Alternatively, since there are three right angles, maybe Q is the orthocenter of some triangle, but I'm not seeing it.

Let me think differently. Since we have two right angles involving E and T, maybe triangles QED and QTD are right triangles. Let me look at triangle QED: Right-angled at E? No, the right angle is at E? Wait, Angle(Q, E, D) is a right angle, so the right angle is at E. So triangle QED is right-angled at E. Similarly, triangle QTD is right-angled at T.

So, in triangle QED, right-angled at E, we have QE perpendicular to ED. In triangle QTD, right-angled at T, QT perpendicular to TD.

Now, in triangle QED: QE ⊥ ED. So, in this triangle, ED = 7 (given), and QE is one leg, ED is another leg, and QD is hypotenuse. So, QD² = QE² + ED². Similarly, in triangle QTD, QT ⊥ TD, so QD² = QT² + TD². Therefore, from both, QE² + ED² = QT² + TD². Hence, QE² - QT² = TD² - ED². But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

But how does this relate to EX and TX?

Wait, maybe there's a way to express EX and TX using these relations.

Alternatively, since X is connected to E and T, and we know EX = 24, TX is what we need to find. Maybe there's a relation between EX and TX through Q?

Alternatively, since X is connected to A, which is the center of the circle, and Q is on the circle, maybe there's some power of a point or something.

Wait, Power of a Point theorem states that for a point outside a circle, the square of the tangent length equals the product of the distances from the point to the intersection points of any secant line. But I don't know if X is outside or inside the circle.

Alternatively, if X lies on the circle, then the power is zero. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, since X is connected to A, which is the center, and if X is on the circle, then AX is the radius. But we don't know if X is on the circle.

But let's assume that X is on the circle. Then AX is equal to the radius, which is |b| as above. But how to connect this with EX?

If X is on the circle, then AX = radius = |b|. Also, EX = 24. So, in triangle AEX, we can write EX² = AX² + AE² - 2*AX*AE*cos(theta), where theta is the angle between AX and AE. But without knowing theta or AE, this may not help.

Alternatively, if we can express AE in terms of other variables. But AE is the distance from A(a,0) to E(c,d), which is sqrt((c-a)^2 + d²). From earlier, we had a*c + b*d = 49, and c² + d² = 49.

Let me compute (c - a)^2 + d² = c² - 2ac + a² + d² = (c² + d²) - 2ac + a² = 49 - 2ac + a².

But from a*c + b*d = 49 → ac = 49 - b*d.

Substitute into above: 49 - 2*(49 - b*d) + a² = 49 - 98 + 2b*d + a² = -49 + a² + 2b*d.

Not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, maybe we can find a relation between a and b. Since Q is on the circle centered at A, so QA is the radius. So QA = |b|, and since Q is (a,b), then the radius is |b|.

But how does this tie in with other equations?

Alternatively, since we have for E: a*c + b*d = 49, and c² + d² = 49.

Let me treat this as a linear equation in variables c and d. So, a*c + b*d = 49, and c² + d² = 49.

This represents the intersection of a line and a circle. The solutions for (c,d) depend on a and b. But without knowing a and b, it's difficult to proceed.

Maybe there's a way to find the distance from Q to E or something. Since QE is perpendicular to ED, and ED has length 7, then in triangle QED, right-angled at E, we have QE² + ED² = QD². So QD² = QE² + 7². Similarly, for T, QD² = QT² + TD². So QE² + 49 = QT² + TD². Hence, QE² - QT² = TD² - 49.

But how does this relate to EX and TX?

Maybe if we can find TD or something else. But TD is the length from T to D. If we can express TD in terms of other variables...

Alternatively, since X is connected to T and E, and we know EX = 24, perhaps there's a way to link EX and TX through some geometric relations.

Wait, maybe X is the orthocenter or something of triangle QDT or something. Not sure.

Alternatively, since X is connected to A, T, E, and we know EX = 24, maybe applying the Pythagorean theorem in some triangle involving EX.

Wait, if I consider triangle EXA or EXT. But without knowing other sides, it's hard.

Another idea: Since there are three right angles at Q, and X is connected to A, T, E, maybe X is the orthocenter of some triangle involving Q, A, T, E. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, since QA, QE, QT are perpendicular to AD, ED, TD respectively, and X is connected to A, T, E, perhaps there's a way to express vectors or coordinates of X in terms of these.

But this feels too vague. Let me try plugging in numbers. Assume some values to see.

Suppose DE = 7, so E is at (7, 0), making D at (0,0) and E at (7,0). Wait, but then ED is along x-axis. Then, QE is perpendicular to ED, which is horizontal, so QE is vertical. So Q would be vertically aligned with E. But earlier, QA is perpendicular to AD. If AD is from A to D, which if D is (0,0) and A is somewhere else. Wait, let me try this scenario.

Let me set D at (0,0), E at (7,0), so DE = 7. Then ED is horizontal from E(7,0) to D(0,0). QE is perpendicular to ED, so QE is vertical. So Q lies along the vertical line through E. So Q is at (7, k) for some k.

Also, QA is perpendicular to AD. Let me assume A is at (a, 0), so AD is from A(a,0) to D(0,0). So AD is horizontal. Hence, QA must be vertical. So Q must lie on the vertical line through A, which is x=a. But earlier, Q is also on the vertical line through E(7,0), so x=7. Therefore, a must be 7. Hence, A is at (7,0). So AD is from (7,0) to (0,0), and QA is vertical line x=7, so Q is at (7, k). 

So now, Q is at (7, k). Also, since QE is vertical from E(7,0) to Q(7,k), so QE has length |k|. 

Now, looking back at the right angle at Q for QED: Triangle QED is right-angled at E, so QE is one leg (length |k|), ED is another leg (length 7), and QD is the hypotenuse. So QD² = k² + 7².

QD is the distance from Q(7,k) to D(0,0): sqrt(7² + k²), which matches.

Now, what about the other right angle at Q, Angle(Q, T, D)? So QT is perpendicular to TD. Let's find T. 

TD is from T to D(0,0). QT is perpendicular to TD. Let me denote T as (t_x, t_y). Then vector TD is (-t_x, -t_y), and vector QT is (t_x - 7, t_y - k). Their dot product is zero:

(-t_x)(t_x - 7) + (-t_y)(t_y - k) = 0  
→ -t_x² + 7t_x - t_y² + k t_y = 0  
→ 7t_x + k t_y = t_x² + t_y².

Also, since there's a circle centered at A(7,0), so the circle has center at (7,0). Q(7,k) is on this circle, so the radius is |k|. Therefore, any point on the circle satisfies (x - 7)^2 + y^2 = k^2.

Now, what about X? X is connected to A(7,0), T(t_x,t_y), and E(7,0). Wait, E is at (7,0), which is the same as A? No, wait, A is at (7,0), E is at (7,0)? No! Wait, earlier assumption was E at (7,0), and A at (7,0)? That would make A and E the same point, which can't be. Wait, I made a mistake here.

Earlier, I assumed E is at (7,0), and A is at (a,0). To make QA perpendicular to AD, which requires that QA is vertical. If A is at (a,0), then AD is from A(a,0) to D(0,0). If I set E at (7,0), then ED is from E(7,0) to D(0,0), which is horizontal. Then QE is vertical, so Q is at (7, k). But QA is vertical, so Q must be at (a, k). Therefore, to satisfy both conditions, a must be 7, hence A is at (7,0). So A and E are both at (7,0)? No, that would mean A and E are the same point, which contradicts the given that they are distinct points. So my assumption that E is at (7,0) leads to conflict. Hence, this approach is flawed.

Let me adjust. Let me instead set E not on the x-axis. Let me choose E at (c, d), with c² + d² = 49, and not on x-axis. Let me pick E at (0,7), making DE = 7 (distance from D(0,0) to E(0,7) is 7). Then ED is vertical. So QE is perpendicular to ED, which is vertical, so QE is horizontal. Hence, Q has the same y-coordinate as E. Since E is at (0,7), then QE is horizontal, so Q is at (q, 7) for some q. Also, QA is perpendicular to AD. Let me define A as (a, 0), so AD is from A(a,0) to D(0,0), which is horizontal. Hence, QA must be vertical. So Q must be vertically aligned with A, i.e., Q is at (a, 7). But Q is also at (q,7), so a = q. Hence, Q is at (a,7). 

Thus, A is at (a,0), Q is at (a,7), E is at (0,7). Now, check if this works. 

Now, for the right angle at QED: QE is horizontal from Q(a,7) to E(0,7), which is leftward. ED is from E(0,7) to D(0,0), which is downward. So the angle at E between Q, E, D is the angle between EQ (left) and ED (down). These are perpendicular? Yes, because EQ is horizontal left, ED is vertical down, so they form a right angle at E. Perfect!

Great, this setup works. Now, let's continue.

Now, we have Q at (a,7), A at (a,0), D at (0,0), E at (0,7).

Now, what about T? We have the right angle at Q, T, D. So QT is perpendicular to TD. Let's find T. Let T be at (t_x, t_y). TD is from T to D(0,0), vector (-t_x, -t_y). QT is from Q(a,7) to T(t_x, t_y), vector (t_x - a, t_y - 7). Their dot product is zero:

(-t_x)(t_x - a) + (-t_y)(t_y - 7) = 0  
→ -t_x² + a t_x - t_y² + 7 t_y = 0  
→ a t_x + 7 t_y = t_x² + t_y².

Also, since there is a circle centered at A(a,0), which includes Q(a,7). The radius is the distance from A to Q: sqrt((a - a)^2 + (7 - 0)^2) = 7. So the circle has equation (x - a)^2 + y^2 = 49.

Now, what about X? X is connected to A(a,0), T(t_x,t_y), and E(0,7). Also, EX = 24. Need to find TX.

Let me consider coordinates of X. Let's denote X as (m, n). Then:

Distance from X to E(0,7) is 24:  
√[(m - 0)^2 + (n - 7)^2] = 24  
→ m² + (n - 7)^2 = 576 ...(1)

Also, X is connected to A(a,0) and T(t_x,t_y). But without knowing where X is, it's tricky. However, perhaps X lies on the circle centered at A? Let's assume X is on the circle. Then, (m - a)^2 + n^2 = 49 ...(2)

Now, subtract equation (2) from equation (1):

[m² + (n - 7)^2] - [(m - a)^2 + n^2] = 576 - 49  
Expand: m² + n² - 14n + 49 - [m² - 2am + a² + n²] = 527  
Simplify: m² + n² -14n +49 - m² + 2am - a² - n² = 527  
→ -14n +49 + 2am - a² = 527  
→ 2am -14n = 527 + a² -49  
→ 2am -14n = a² + 478 ...(3)

This relates m, n, and a. But we need more relations to solve for m and n. Let's see if we can find more info about T.

From earlier, for T: a t_x + 7 t_y = t_x² + t_y². Also, T lies on the circle centered at A(a,0)? Not necessarily. But maybe it does? Let me check. If T is on the circle, then (t_x - a)^2 + t_y^2 = 49. Expanding: t_x² - 2a t_x + a² + t_y² = 49. Rearranged: t_x² + t_y² = 2a t_x - a² + 49. Substituting into the equation from the perpendicular condition:

a t_x + 7 t_y = t_x² + t_y² = 2a t_x - a² + 49  
→ a t_x + 7 t_y = 2a t_x - a² + 49  
→ -a t_x + 7 t_y = -a² + 49  
→ a t_x - 7 t_y = a² - 49 ...(4)

So if T is on the circle, this equation holds. But we don't know if T is on the circle. However, this is a potential path.

Assuming T is on the circle, we have equation (4). Now, let's see if we can relate this to X.

But X is connected to T. So, if X is also on the circle, then TX is the distance between two points on the circle. But how?

Alternatively, since X is on the circle, and T is on the circle, then TX is a chord of the circle. But without knowing the position of T, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, since X is on the circle, and EX = 24, which is much larger than the diameter of the circle (which is 14, since radius is 7). So EX = 24 implies that X is outside the circle. Hence, X is outside the circle centered at A, and EX is 24.

Now, let's think about power of a point. The power of point E with respect to the circle centered at A is equal to EX * something. Wait, the power of E with respect to the circle is |EA|^2 - r^2, where r is the radius. Here, r = 7, and EA is the distance from E to A. 

In our current setup, E is at (0,7), A is at (a,0). So EA squared is (a - 0)^2 + (0 - 7)^2 = a² + 49. Hence, power of E is (a² + 49) - 7² = a². 

Power of point E with respect to the circle is equal to the square of the tangent from E to the circle, which is also equal to EX * EX', where EX' is the other intersection point. But since X is outside, and assuming line EX intersects the circle at two points, but since we only have one point X, maybe it's just the tangent? Wait, if EX is tangent to the circle, then power of E would be EX². But in our case, EX = 24, so power of E is 24² = 576. But earlier calculation said power of E is a². Hence:

a² = 576 → a = ±24.

Ah! This is crucial. So from power of a point, we get a² = 576 → a = 24 or -24. Assuming a positive value, a = 24.

So A is at (24, 0). Now, we can find other variables.

Now, since a = 24, let's revisit equation (4): a t_x - 7 t_y = a² - 49 → 24 t_x -7 t_y = 24² - 49 = 576 - 49 = 527. So 24 t_x -7 t_y = 527.

Also, since T is on the circle centered at A(24,0), its coordinates satisfy (t_x - 24)^2 + t_y^2 = 49.

Expanding this: t_x² - 48 t_x + 576 + t_y^2 = 49 → t_x² + t_y^2 = 48 t_x - 527.

But from equation (4): 24 t_x -7 t_y = 527 → 7 t_y = 24 t_x - 527 → t_y = (24 t_x - 527)/7.

Now, substitute t_y into the equation t_x² + t_y² = 48 t_x - 527:

t_x² + [(24 t_x - 527)/7]^2 = 48 t_x - 527.

This looks complex, but maybe we can solve for t_x. Let me expand:

Let me denote numerator as N = 24 t_x - 527. Then,

t_x² + (N²)/(49) = 48 t_x - 527.

Multiply both sides by 49:

49 t_x² + N² = 49*(48 t_x - 527).

But N = 24 t_x - 527, so N² = (24 t_x)^2 - 2*24*527 t_x + 527².

This seems very messy. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, since we know a = 24, and we're trying to find TX, let's think about coordinates of X. 

We have X on the circle? No, because power of E gave us that EX² = a² = 576, so EX = 24, which matches the given. So X is the point where the tangent from E touches the circle. Hence, EX is the tangent from E to the circle, and X is the point of tangency. Hence, TX is the distance from T to X, where T is another point on the circle.

But wait, T is another point on the circle. How does this relate?

Alternatively, since X is the tangency point from E, and T is another point on the circle, TX is the length between X and T. But how to find it?

Alternatively, since X is the tangency point, and T is another point on the circle, maybe we can find TX using coordinates.

But to find coordinates of X, since it's the tangency point from E(0,7) to the circle centered at A(24,0) with radius 7.

The formula for the tangent from a point to a circle: the tangent points can be found by solving the equations.

The general method: Given a circle (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 and a point (x1, y1), the tangent lines from (x1, y1) to the circle can be found by parametric equations or using the condition that the distance from the point to the center squared equals the sum of the square of the radius and the square of the tangent length.

But we already used that to find a = 24.

To find the coordinates of X, the tangency point, we can use the fact that EX is perpendicular to AX, since the tangent at X is perpendicular to the radius AX.

So vector EX · vector AX = 0.

Vector EX is from E(0,7) to X(m,n): (m - 0, n - 7) = (m, n - 7).

Vector AX is from A(24,0) to X(m,n): (m - 24, n - 0) = (m - 24, n).

Their dot product is zero:

m*(m - 24) + (n - 7)*n = 0  
→ m² - 24m + n² -7n = 0 ...(5)

Also, since X lies on the circle centered at A(24,0) with radius 7: (m - 24)^2 + n² = 49. Expand:

m² - 48m + 576 + n² = 49 → m² + n² = 48m - 527 ...(6)

Substitute equation (6) into equation (5):

(48m - 527) -24m -7n = 0 → 24m - 527 -7n = 0 → 24m -7n = 527 ...(7)

Which matches the earlier equation from the power of point, confirming consistency.

Now, we have two equations:

From (6): m² + n² = 48m - 527  
From (7): 24m -7n = 527

Let me solve for n from (7): 7n = 24m - 527 → n = (24m - 527)/7.

Substitute into (6):

m² + [(24m - 527)/7]^2 = 48m - 527.

This is a quadratic in m, but solving it would require expanding, which is tedious. Instead, perhaps we can find m and n by recognizing that X lies on the tangent from E to the circle.

Alternatively, since we know the tangent line from E to the circle, we can find its equation.

The line EX is tangent to the circle at X, and passes through E(0,7). The equation of the tangent line can be found using the condition that it is perpendicular to AX.

Let me parameterize the line EX. Let me denote the slope of EX as s. Since it passes through E(0,7), the equation is y - 7 = s(x - 0) → y = sx + 7.

This line is tangent to the circle (x - 24)^2 + y^2 = 49. The condition for tangency is that the distance from the center A(24,0) to the line is equal to the radius 7.

The distance from (24,0) to the line y = sx + 7 is |s*24 - 0 + 7| / sqrt(s² + 1) ) = |24s + 7| / sqrt(s² + 1) = 7.

So:

|24s + 7| = 7 sqrt(s² + 1)

Square both sides:

(24s + 7)^2 = 49(s² + 1)  
Expand left side: 576s² + 336s + 49 = 49s² + 49  
Bring all terms to left: 576s² + 336s + 49 -49s² -49 = 0  
→ 527s² + 336s = 0  
Factor: s(527s + 336) = 0

Solutions: s = 0 or s = -336/527.

So, the slopes of the tangent lines from E are 0 and -336/527.

First, s = 0: line is y = 7. This is horizontal line. Check if it is tangent to the circle. At y=7, intersecting the circle: (x - 24)^2 + 49 = 49 → (x - 24)^2 = 0 → x=24. So the point of tangency is (24,7). This
