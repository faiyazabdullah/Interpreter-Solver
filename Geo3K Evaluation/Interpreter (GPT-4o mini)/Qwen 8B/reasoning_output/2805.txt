Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a circle O, and EC and AB are diameters. Also, the angles ∠BO D, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, and ∠FOA are all congruent. We need to find the measure of arc AE.

First, I need to visualize the circle. Since EC and AB are diameters, they must pass through the center O. That means points A, B, C, E are all on the circumference, and O is the center. Let me sketch this mentally: circle with center O, two diameters AB and EC. Now, the angles mentioned are at point O, so each angle is formed by two radii. For example, ∠BO D would be between OB and OD, and similarly for the others.

Given that all these four angles (∠BO D, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, ∠FOA) are congruent. Since they're all at the center, each of these angles is a central angle. Central angles correspond to arcs. The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc. So if all those angles are congruent, their corresponding arcs should also be congruent.

Now, how many angles are there? There are four angles: BOD, DOE, EOF, FOA. Each of these is congruent. Let me think about how they fit around the circle. Starting from point B, going through D, E, F, and back to A. Wait, but since AB and EC are diameters, maybe there's some overlap?

Wait, AB is one diameter, EC is another. So points A and B are endpoints of one diameter, and E and C are endpoints of another. But where are points D and F? The angles involve D and F. Maybe D and F are other points on the circle?

Since the angles are at O, each angle is between two radii. So for example, angle BOD is between OB and OD. Then DOE is between OD and OE, then EOF between OE and OF, and FOA between OF and OA. So starting from OB, each subsequent angle adds another radius. Therefore, the total around point O would be the sum of these four angles. Since the full circle is 360 degrees, the sum of these four angles must be 360°. 

But wait, each of these four angles is congruent. Let me denote each angle as x. So 4x = 360°, which means x = 90°. So each of these central angles is 90 degrees. Therefore, each arc between those points would be 90 degrees as well. 

So, arc BD corresponds to angle BOD (which is 90°), arc DE corresponds to angle DOE (another 90°), arc EF corresponds to angle EOF (another 90°), and arc FA corresponds to angle FOA (another 90°). Wait, but adding up these arcs: BD + DE + EF + FA = 360°, which makes sense. 

But the question asks for the measure of arc AE. How do we get from here to arc AE? Let me see. Let's consider the positions of points. 

Starting from point A, moving along the circle. Let me try to map out the order of points. Suppose AB is a diameter, so A and B are opposite each other. Similarly, EC is another diameter, so E and C are opposite each other. But where are D and F?

From the angles mentioned: angle BOD, DOE, EOF, FOA. So starting from OB, then OD, then OE, then OF, then OA. So the points D, E, F are placed such that each consecutive pair forms a 90° angle at O. 

Let me imagine the circle divided into four equal parts by these angles. Each arc between adjacent points (like B to D, D to E, E to F, F to A) is 90°. Wait, but AB is a diameter. Let me think about the entire setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the points are arranged as follows: starting from point A, going counterclockwise, we have points F, E, D, B, and then back to A? Not sure yet. Let me try again.

Since angle BOD is 90°, that means from point B to D is 90°, then from D to E is another 90°, so E is 180° from B? Wait, but EC is a diameter. Hmm, maybe overlapping.

Alternatively, perhaps the points are arranged such that each angle divides the circle into quarters. Since each angle is 90°, the points D, E, F divide the circle into four equal arcs. However, since AB and EC are diameters, which are straight lines through the center.

Wait, suppose AB is horizontal, with A on the left and B on the right. EC is vertical, with E at top and C at bottom. Then, the angles mentioned would be between different directions. For instance, angle BOD would be between OB (right direction) and OD. If each angle is 90°, then OD would be pointing upwards from O, making angle BOD=90°, so D is at the top? But EC is already a vertical diameter. So maybe D coincides with E? Or not?

Wait, maybe there's confusion here. Let me think again. The angles are BOD, DOE, EOF, FOA. So, each angle starts from the previous radius. So, starting with OB, then OD is next, then OE, then OF, then OA. So, the order of points around the circle from B would be D, E, F, A. Wait, but OA is part of diameter AB. So, if we start at B, go to D, then E, then F, then A. So, the arc from B to D is 90°, D to E another 90°, E to F another 90°, and F to A another 90°, totaling 360°. 

Therefore, point A is located 90° away from F, which is 90° away from E, which is 90° away from D, which is 90° away from B. Now, AB is a diameter. So, the arc from A to B is 180°, because it's a straight line through the center. Let me check if this holds.

Suppose we start at point B, move 90° to D, then another 90° to E, then another 90° to F, then another 90° to A. So from B to D is 90°, D to E is another 90°, E to F another 90°, and F to A another 90°. Therefore, from B to A via D, E, F is 90*4=360°, which loops around the circle. Wait, but the arc from B to A directly is 180°, but according to this, the path goes around the whole circle. That suggests that my assumption is wrong.

Ah, maybe the points are arranged differently. Let me try again. Since AB and EC are diameters, they cross at O. Let me assume AB is horizontal, with A on the left, B on the right. EC is vertical, with E at the top and C at the bottom. Then, the angles mentioned are at O. So, angle BOD: from OB (right) to OD. If angle BOD is 90°, then OD would be pointing upward from O, which would make D coincide with E? Because E is the top of the vertical diameter. Then angle DOE would be between OD (which is OE) and OE, but that would be zero. That doesn't make sense. So perhaps my initial assumption is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the points D and F are not on the same diameter. Let me think. The angles are BOD, DOE, EOF, FOA. So, starting from OB, then OD, then OE, then OF, then OA. So, each time rotating by 90°. So, if OB is pointing to B (right), then OD would be 90° counterclockwise from OB, which would be upward (towards E). Then OE is another 90° from OD, which would be towards the left (pointing to A?), but wait, OA is a diameter. Wait, if OA is a diameter, then A is directly opposite B. So if B is right, A is left. 

So, starting from OB (right), turning 90° counterclockwise gives us OD pointing up (toward E). Then, from OD (upward), another 90° counterclockwise would point to the left (towards A). So OE would be pointing left, which is the same direction as OA. But OA is a diameter, so E would be at the same position as A? No, that can't be. Unless E is A, but that seems conflicting.

Wait, maybe the rotation is clockwise instead of counterclockwise? If we rotate clockwise from OB (right), then OD would be downward (towards C). Then OE would be another 90° clockwise, which would be left (towards A). Then OF another 90° clockwise would be upward (towards E again). Then FOA would be from OF (upward) to OA (left). Wait, but that would mean angle FOA is between OF (up) and OA (left), which is 90°, yes. 

But then, let's track the points. Starting from B (right). Rotate 90° clockwise to OD (downward, which is point C). Then OE would be another 90° clockwise from OD (down), which is left (point A). Then OF is another 90° clockwise from OE (left), which is upward (point E). Then OA is from OF (up) to OA (left), which is another 90°. 

But in this case, the points D and F are C and E? Wait, EC is a diameter, so E and C are endpoints. So if OD is pointing down, that's point C. Then OE is pointing left (point A), but A is the endpoint of diameter AB. Wait, but OE is supposed to be a radius. So, if OE is pointing left, then E would be the point opposite to the right side. Wait, but EC is a diameter, so E is on the top. This seems confusing. 

Maybe I need to assign coordinates to make it clearer. Let me place the circle with center O at (0,0). Let’s say AB is horizontal, with A at (-r, 0) and B at (r, 0). EC is another diameter; let's assume it's vertical, so E is at (0, r) and C is at (0, -r). Now, the angles mentioned are ∠BOD, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, ∠FOA. All congruent, each being x degrees. Since there are four angles, 4x = 360°, so x = 90°. So each angle is 90°. 

Starting with ∠BOD: this is the angle between OB (from O to B, which is along positive x-axis) and OD. If this angle is 90°, then OD must be pointing in the direction perpendicular to OB. Since OB is along positive x-axis, OD could be either positive y-axis or negative y-axis. But since EC is the vertical diameter, E is at (0,r), C at (0,-r). So if OD is pointing up (positive y-axis), then D is point E. Then ∠DOE would be between OD (OE) and OE. But OE is the same as OD, so that angle would be zero, which contradicts. Therefore, OD must be pointing down (negative y-axis), so D is point C. Then ∠DOE is between OD (OC) and OE. OC is pointing down, OE is pointing up. So the angle between them is 180°, but we were told it's 90°, which doesn't fit. Hmm, contradiction here. 

Wait, maybe the angles are measured in the other direction. If ∠BOD is 90°, but measured clockwise instead of counterclockwise? Let me think. If we take ∠BOD as the angle from OB to OD, but in the clockwise direction. So starting from OB (positive x-axis), turning 90° clockwise would point to the negative y-axis. So OD is pointing down, which is point C. Then ∠DOE is the angle from OD (pointing down) to OE. Where is point E? It's at (0, r). So from OD (down) to OE (up) would be 180°, which again conflicts with the requirement of 90°. 

This suggests that my initial assumption that all four angles add up to 360° is incorrect. Wait, but there are four angles, each at the center, so they should add up to 360°, right? Yes, because the total around point O is 360°. So if each angle is congruent, then each is 90°. So why does the positioning seem conflicting?

Perhaps the points D and F are not aligned with the existing diameters. Let me try again. Let me forget about the diameters EC and AB for a moment. The circle has center O. There are two diameters: AB and EC. Additionally, there are points D and F such that angles BOD, DOE, EOF, FOA are all 90°. So, starting from OB, each subsequent angle turns 90°, leading to points D, E, F, and finally back to A. 

Assume the circle is divided into four equal arcs by these angles. So each arc between B-D, D-E, E-F, F-A is 90°. Thus, the arc from B to A via D, E, F is 90*4 = 360°, which brings us back to B. Wait, but that implies that F-A is the last arc. So, starting from B, going through D, E, F, and ending at A. 

But AB is a diameter, so the arc from A to B should be 180°, but according to this, the arc from B to A via D, E, F is 360°, which would imply that the arc BA is actually a major arc, but since AB is a diameter, the minor arc AB is 180°. So, maybe the arc from B to A passing through D, E, F is the major arc, while the minor arc is the direct one. 

But the question asks for the measure of arc AE. So, we need to find the arc from A to E. Let me think about the positions. From earlier, we had that the arc from B to D is 90°, D to E is 90°, E to F is 90°, F to A is 90°. So, starting from B, moving 90° gets to D, another 90° to E, another to F, and another to A. 

So, from B to E is two arcs: B to D (90°), D to E (90°), total 180°. So E is directly opposite B. But since EC is a diameter, E is connected to C. So if B is at (r, 0), then E is at (-r, 0)? No, because EC is a diameter. Wait, if E is directly opposite B, then EC would be a diameter passing through E and C. But if E is opposite B, then C would be... Let me think. 

Alternatively, maybe the arc from B to E is 180°, making BE a diameter. But the original diameters are AB and EC. So unless BE is another diameter, but that isn't stated. So this may not hold. 

Alternatively, maybe the arc from B to D is 90°, D to E is 90°, so from B to E is 180°, making BE a diameter. But the given diameters are AB and EC. So BE would be another diameter. But this isn't specified, so maybe that's acceptable. 

Assuming that, then BE is a diameter. So E is the point opposite B. Since AB is a diameter, and BE is another diameter, then E must be the point such that BE passes through the center O. So if B is at (r, 0), then E would be at (-r, 0), but that's the same as point A, since A is the other end of diameter AB. Wait, no. If AB is a diameter, then A is at (-r, 0) and B at (r, 0). If BE is another diameter, then E would be at (-r, 0), which is point A. But that would make E coincide with A, which can't be since the angles involve E and F. So this suggests inconsistency.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the direction of rotation. What if the angles are measured counterclockwise? Let's try that. Starting from OB (right), angle BOD is 90° counterclockwise, so OD points up (towards E). Then ∠DOE is 90° from OD to OE. If OD is up (E), then OE would be another 90° counterclockwise from OD, which would be to the left (point A). So OE is pointing left, which is the direction of point A. Then ∠EOF is 90° from OE (left) to OF. Counterclockwise, that would be upward (point E again?) Wait, no. From left (OE), counterclockwise 90° would be upward. So OF is pointing up. Then ∠FOA is from OF (up) to OA. OA is the diameter from O to A, which is left. So from up to left is 90°, yes. 

So in this scenario, the points are: 
- D is at up (point E)
- E is at left (point A)
- F is at up (same as D?)
Wait, this seems overlapping. If OE is pointing left (A), then E is the point at left, which is A. But E was supposed to be an endpoint of diameter EC. So if E is A, then EC is a diameter from A to C. So C would be the opposite of A, which is B. Wait, but B is already the other end of diameter AB. So if E is A and C is B, then EC is the same as AB, which is a diameter. But the problem states that EC and AB are diameters, implying they are distinct. So this suggests that E cannot be A. Hence, something is wrong here.

This is getting complicated. Perhaps I need to approach it differently. Since each of the four angles is 90°, and they are all at the center, their corresponding arcs are each 90°. So the arcs BD, DE, EF, FA are each 90°. Wait, but if that's the case, then the arc from B to A via D, E, F is 90+90+90+90 = 360°, which would mean that the arc BA is actually the whole circle, which isn't possible. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the arcs are not BD, DE, EF, FA, but rather BO to D, D to E, E to F, F to A. Wait, but those are just the arcs between the points. Alternatively, maybe the arcs are between the points where the angles intercept. For example, angle BOD intercepts arc BD, angle DOE intercepts arc DE, etc. So each of these arcs is 90°, so BD = DE = EF = FA = 90°. Therefore, the total from B to A via these arcs is 90*4 = 360°, which loops around the circle. 

But arc AE is the arc from A to E. To find that, let's see: Starting from A, how much is the arc to E? Let me think about the positions. If we traverse from B to D (90°), D to E (90°), E to F (90°), F to A (90°). So starting from B, going to D, E, F, then to A. So from B to A via these points is 360°, which implies that the arc from A to B through D, E, F is 360°, meaning that the arc from A to B directly is the shorter arc, which is 180°, as it's a diameter. 

But how does this relate to arc AE? Let me try to find the arc from A to E. If we go from A to E, depending on the direction. Let me think of the circle divided into four 90° arcs: BD, DE, EF, FA. So, if we start at A, and move clockwise, the arc AF is 90°, then FE is 90°, ED is 90°, and DB is 90°. So, from A to E: going clockwise, from A to F is 90°, F to E is another 90°, so total 180°. Alternatively, going counter-clockwise from A to E would be the rest of the circle, which would be 180° as well. Wait, but that would mean arc AE is 180°, making it a semicircle. 

But the answer choices include 180° as option C. But let me verify. If arc AE is 180°, then the measure is 180°, so answer C. But let me confirm this with another approach. 

Alternatively, since each of the four arcs BD, DE, EF, FA is 90°, then from A to E, moving through F and E, it's arc AF + FE = 90° + 90° = 180°, hence arc AE is 180°. Therefore, the measure of arc AE is 180°, so the answer is C. 

But wait, let me check if there's another way to look at it. Suppose arc AE is the arc that doesn't pass through B, D, etc. But since the circle is divided into four 90° arcs, the arc from A to E could be the minor arc or major arc. If we take the minor arc, it's 180°, which is a straight line. But since AB is a diameter, and E is somewhere else, depends on the placement. 

Alternatively, if the arc AE is the one that goes through F, which is 90° + 90° = 180°, yes. So regardless of direction, the arc AE measures 180°, making it a semicircle. Hence, the answer is C.
