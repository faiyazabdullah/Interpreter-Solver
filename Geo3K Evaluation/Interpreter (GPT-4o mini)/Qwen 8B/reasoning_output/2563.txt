Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a quadrilateral JKLM, which is a parallelogram. Wait, the problem says "use parallelogram JKLM," so that's important. Let me recall the properties of a parallelogram. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in length and parallel, and opposite angles are equal. Also, consecutive angles are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. Additionally, the diagonals bisect each other.

Now, looking at the given predicates. First, Quadrilateral(J,K,L,M) confirms it's a quadrilateral. Then there are some angle measures: Angle(J,M,L) is 30 degrees, and Angle(K,L,M) is 70 degrees. Also, there are lengths: Line(J,M) is 3a, Line(K,L) is 21 units, Line(M,L) is 45 units, and Line(J,K) is 2b + 3 units. The question asks for the measure of angle KJL, which is angle at point J between points K and L.

Wait, but since it's a parallelogram, maybe I need to use the properties of parallelograms here. But first, let me make sure about the structure. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. So if JKLM is a parallelogram, then side JK should equal LM, and side KL equals JM. Wait, but the given lengths are Line(J,M) = 3a, Line(K,L)=21, Line(M,L)=45, and Line(J,K)=2b+3. Hmm. Let me try to visualize the parallelogram.

In a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. Also, the sum of all angles is 360 degrees. Let me note down the given angles. Angle at JML is 30 degrees, which would be angle at M between J and L. Wait, angle(J,M,L) means vertex at M, with segments MJ and ML. So that's angle at M. Similarly, angle(K,L,M) is angle at L between K and M. Wait, perhaps I need to sketch this mentally.

Let me label the quadrilateral as J, K, L, M in order. Since it's a parallelogram, the order matters. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are parallel. So sides JK and LM are opposite, and sides KL and JM are opposite. Therefore, JK || LM and KL || JM. Also, the lengths of opposite sides are equal. So, Length(JK) = Length(LM), and Length(KL) = Length(JM).

Looking at the given lengths: Line(J,M) is 3a. Wait, Line(J,M) would be the diagonal? Or is that a side? Wait, in a parallelogram, the sides are JK, KL, LM, and MJ. Wait, but the problem mentions Line(J,M). That's a diagonal connecting J and M. Because in a parallelogram, the diagonals connect opposite vertices. So if the quadrilateral is J-K-L-M-J, then the diagonals are JL and KM. Wait, but Line(J,M) connects J to M, which are two vertices. Wait, in a parallelogram, J and M are opposite vertices? No, because in a parallelogram with vertices J, K, L, M in order, the opposite vertices would be J and L, K and M. Wait, so J connected to M would be a diagonal. So the diagonal JM has length 3a. 

But also given Length(K,L) is 21. Since KL is a side of the parallelogram. And Length(M,L) is 45. Wait, ML is another side? Wait, if the sides are JK, KL, LM, and MJ, then ML would be one of the sides. Wait, but in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. So KL equals JM, and LM equals JK. Wait, but the length of KL is 21, so JM should be 21. However, the length of JM is given as 3a. So 3a = 21? That implies a=7. Maybe that's useful later.

Also, Length(M,L) is 45. So LM is 45. Since LM is opposite to JK, then JK should also be 45. Wait, but Length(J,K) is given as 2b + 3. So 2b + 3 = 45. Solving for b gives 2b = 42 => b=21. But maybe that's not directly needed yet.

So summarizing the sides:

KL = 21, so JM = 21 (since KL and JM are opposite sides in a parallelogram). JM is given as 3a, so 3a = 21 → a=7. Then LM = 45, so JK = 45. But JK is given as 2b + 3. Thus, 2b + 3 = 45 → 2b = 42 → b=21. So these are consistent. 

Now, moving on to angles. Given Angle(J,M,L) is 30 degrees. Let me parse this. The angle at point M between points J and L. So that's angle JML. So in the parallelogram, at vertex M, the angle between JM and ML. Similarly, Angle(K,L,M) is 70 degrees. This is the angle at point L between points K and M. So angle KLM. 

Since it's a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. For example, angle at M and angle at L are consecutive. Wait, but in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. Wait, but depending on how the parallelogram is labeled. Let me think again about the structure.

Assuming the parallelogram is labeled in order J, K, L, M. So sides are JK, KL, LM, MJ. Then the angles at each vertex: angle at J, K, L, M. Now, in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So angle J equals angle L, and angle K equals angle M. Also, consecutive angles are supplementary. So angle J + angle K = 180°, etc.

But the given angles are angle JML (which is angle at M between J and L) and angle KLM (angle at L between K and M). Wait, angle JML is part of triangle JML? Or is it an internal angle?

Wait, angle JML is at vertex M. So in the parallelogram, at vertex M, the sides are JM and ML. So the angle between JM and ML at M is given as 30 degrees. Similarly, angle KLM is at vertex L, between K and M. So that's the angle between KL and LM at vertex L, which is 70 degrees.

Wait, in a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. So angle at M (which is between JM and ML) and angle at L (between KL and LM) should be supplementary? Wait, but those are adjacent angles? Let me see.

If the parallelogram is J-K-L-M-J, then at vertex L, the sides are KL and LM. At vertex M, the sides are LM and MJ. So the angle at L and angle at M are adjacent angles. Therefore, they should add up to 180 degrees. Wait, but according to the given data, angle at M is 30 degrees, and angle at L is 70 degrees. Adding them gives 30 + 70 = 100, which is not 180. That contradicts the property of parallelograms. So something is wrong here. Did I misinterpret the angles?

Wait, maybe the angles given are not the internal angles of the parallelogram. Wait, angle JML is at vertex M, but in the parallelogram, the internal angle at M would be between JM and ML, which is indeed angle JML. But if that's 30 degrees, and angle at L (which would be angle KLM) is 70 degrees, adding to 100, which doesn't fit. So this suggests either my understanding is wrong, or there's a mistake in the problem setup? Or perhaps the figure isn't a standard parallelogram? Wait, but the problem states that it is a parallelogram. So there must be something wrong here.

Alternatively, maybe the given angles are not the internal angles but some other angles? Wait, let me re-examine the angle definitions. Angle(J,M,L) is angle at M between J and L. So that is the angle formed at vertex M by the lines MJ and ML. Which in the parallelogram would be the internal angle at M. Similarly, angle(K,L,M) is angle at L between K and M, which is the internal angle at L. 

So according to the properties of a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So angle at M and angle at L should be supplementary. But given as 30 and 70, which sum to 100. Not supplementary. Contradiction. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Unless the figure is not a parallelogram? But the problem says it is a parallelogram. So maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the labels of the parallelogram?

Wait, maybe the order of the points is different. Perhaps the parallelogram is labeled differently. For example, maybe it's J, K, M, L instead of J, K, L, M. Wait, but the problem says "parallelogram J K L M". Usually, the order of letters in a quadrilateral indicates the order of the vertices. So J connected to K, K to L, L to M, M to J. Hence forming a quadrilateral. So if that's the case, then the sides are JK, KL, LM, MJ. 

Alternatively, maybe the labeling is such that the parallelogram is J, K, L, M arranged so that sides are JK, KL, LM, MJ. Then the angles at each vertex are as follows: at J between K and M, at K between J and L, at L between K and M, and at M between L and J. Wait, but that seems inconsistent. Alternatively, perhaps the angles given are not the internal angles. Wait, but angle(J,M,L) is the angle at M between J and L. So in the parallelogram, the sides meeting at M are MJ and ML. So yes, that's the internal angle at M. Similarly, angle at L between K and M is the internal angle at L. 

So given that, in a parallelogram, the sum of consecutive angles should be 180 degrees. So angle at M (30) plus angle at L (70) should be 180, but 30+70=100. So that's impossible. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here. 

Wait, maybe the given angles are not the internal angles of the parallelogram. Could they be angles formed by the diagonals? For instance, in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other but do not necessarily form right angles unless it's a rhombus or rectangle. Alternatively, could the given angles be angles formed by extending sides or something else?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to a non-convex parallelogram? But even then, the sum of consecutive angles would still be 180. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is not a parallelogram but a trapezoid? But the problem explicitly says it's a parallelogram. There's a contradiction here. 

Wait, maybe the given angles are not the internal angles but something else. Let me check the original problem statement again. It says:

"Quadrilateral(J,K,L,M)
Equals(Angle(J,M,L), 30)
Equals(Angle(K,L,M), 70)
LengthOf(Line(J,M), 3a)
LengthOf(Line(K,L), 21)
LengthOf(Line(M,L), 45)
LengthOf(Line(J,K), 2b + 3)"

Ah! Wait, the angle at M between J and L is 30 degrees. So that's angle JML. But in a parallelogram, if sides are JK, KL, LM, MJ, then at point M, the sides are LM and MJ. So the internal angle at M is between LM and MJ. But the given angle is between J, M, L, which would be the angle between MJ and ML. Wait, but ML is the same as LM. So that's the internal angle at M. So that's correct. Similarly, angle at L between K and M is angle KLM, which is the internal angle at L. 

Therefore, in the parallelogram, angle at M is 30 degrees, angle at L is 70 degrees. But in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So angle at M equals angle at L? Wait, no. Opposite angles in a parallelogram are equal. So angle at J equals angle at L, and angle at K equals angle at M. Wait, if angle at M is 30, then angle at K should also be 30. And angle at L is 70, so angle at J is also 70. Then consecutive angles would be 70 + 30 = 100, which is not 180. Still contradiction. 

This suggests that there's an inconsistency in the given data, but since the problem states it's a parallelogram, I must have misunderstood the configuration. 

Wait, perhaps the given angles are not the internal angles of the parallelogram, but rather angles formed by the intersection of diagonals? For example, in a parallelogram, the diagonals intersect at certain angles. But the problem refers to angles involving points J, M, L and K, L, M. 

Alternatively, maybe the diagram is not a standard parallelogram, but a different type of quadrilateral named as a parallelogram? Wait, no. A parallelogram is defined as a quadrilateral with both pairs of opposite sides parallel. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves vectors or coordinates? Let me consider coordinate geometry. Suppose we assign coordinates to the points. Let me attempt that. 

Let me place point M at the origin (0,0). Since angle at M is 30 degrees, and side ML is 45 units long (given as Length(M,L) = 45). So if M is at (0,0), then point L could be at (45, 0). Then, the angle at M is between JM and ML. So vector MJ makes an angle of 30 degrees with ML. Assuming ML is along the x-axis from M(0,0) to L(45,0). Then vector MJ would make a 30-degree angle above the x-axis. Let me define point J somewhere in the plane. 

Let me denote the length of JM as 3a. Earlier, we found that JM is equal to KL, which is 21. So 3a = 21 ⇒ a=7. So JM is 21 units. So the distance from M(0,0) to J is 21. If angle at M is 30 degrees, then coordinates of J can be determined. Let me calculate coordinates of J. 

If ML is along positive x-axis from M(0,0) to L(45,0). The angle between JM and ML is 30 degrees. So direction of JM is 30 degrees above the x-axis. So coordinates of J can be expressed as M + vector of length 21 at 30 degrees. So:

x-coordinate of J: 0 + 21*cos(30°) = 21*(√3/2) ≈ 21*0.866 ≈ 18.186

y-coordinate of J: 0 + 21*sin(30°) = 21*(0.5) = 10.5

So J is at approximately (18.186, 10.5). 

Now, since it's a parallelogram, vector KL must equal vector JM. Vector JM is from J to M: M - J = (-18.186, -10.5). Wait, no. In a parallelogram, vector JM is from J to M, but in terms of translation, the opposite sides are equal and parallel. So vector KL should equal vector JM. 

Vector KL goes from K to L. We know point L is at (45,0). Let me assume point K is somewhere. Also, we know the length of KL is 21. Wait, earlier we had KL = 21, which was given as Length(K,L) = 21. So the length between K and L is 21. Also, since in a parallelogram, vector KL equals vector JM. Vector JM is from J to M, which is (0 - 18.186, 0 - 10.5) = (-18.186, -10.5). Therefore, vector KL should be the same. So vector KL = L - K = (-18.186, -10.5). Therefore, if point L is at (45,0), then point K = L - vector KL = (45,0) - (-18.186, -10.5) = (45 + 18.186, 0 + 10.5) = (63.186, 10.5). 

So coordinates of K are approximately (63.186, 10.5). 

Now, we also have the length of JK is given as 2b + 3. Let's compute the distance between J(18.186,10.5) and K(63.186,10.5). Since they have the same y-coordinate, the distance is difference in x-coordinates: 63.186 - 18.186 = 45. So distance JK is 45. According to the problem, this length is 2b + 3. Therefore:

2b + 3 = 45 ⇒ 2b = 42 ⇒ b = 21. Which is consistent with our previous calculation where a=7, b=21. 

Now, we need to find the measure of angle KJL. Angle at point J between points K and L. So angle KJL is the angle at J between K and L. Let me find this angle. 

Point J is at (approx) (18.186, 10.5), point K is at (63.186, 10.5), and point L is at (45, 0). So we need to find the angle at J between lines JK and JL. 

First, let's find vectors JK and JL. 

Vector JK is from J to K: K - J = (63.186 - 18.186, 10.5 - 10.5) = (45, 0). 

Vector JL is from J to L: L - J = (45 - 18.186, 0 - 10.5) = (26.814, -10.5). 

Now, the angle between vectors JK and JL at point J is the angle we need. To find this angle, we can use the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (JK · JL) / (|JK| |JL|)

Compute the dot product:

JK · JL = (45)(26.814) + (0)(-10.5) = 45 * 26.814 ≈ 1206.63

|JK| is the magnitude of vector JK, which is sqrt(45² + 0²) = 45.

|JL| is sqrt((26.814)^2 + (-10.5)^2). Let's calculate that:

First, 26.814 squared: approx (26.814)^2. Let's compute 26^2 = 676, 0.814^2 ≈ 0.662, cross term 2*26*0.814 ≈ 42.0. Total approx 676 + 42 + 0.662 = 718.662. But more accurately, since 26.814 is the x-component of JL, which came from 45 - 18.186 = 26.814. Wait, actually, earlier we said that the x-coordinate of J was 21*cos(30°). Wait, cos(30°) is √3/2 ≈ 0.866. So 21 * 0.866 ≈ 18.186. So the x-coordinate of J is 18.186, and L is at x=45, so JL's x-component is 45 - 18.186 = 26.814. 

So (26.814)^2 = (approx) 26.814^2. Let me calculate it precisely. Since 26.814 = 45 - 21*cos(30°). Wait, but maybe we can relate this to the actual values. Alternatively, note that in the coordinate system, we can calculate |JL|. 

Alternatively, since we know the coordinates, let's compute |JL|:

Δx = 45 - 21*cos(30°), Δy = 0 - 21*sin(30°). 

Wait, point J is located at (21*cos(30°), 21*sin(30°)) = ( (21√3)/2 , 21*(1/2) ) = ( (21√3)/2 , 10.5 )

Thus, vector JL has components (45 - (21√3)/2 , 0 - 10.5 ). So:

Δx = 45 - (21√3)/2

Δy = -10.5

So |JL|^2 = [45 - (21√3)/2]^2 + (10.5)^2

But this seems complicated. However, we can proceed numerically. 

Let me compute Δx ≈ 45 - (21 * 0.866) ≈ 45 - 18.186 ≈ 26.814

Δy = -10.5

So |JL| ≈ sqrt( (26.814)^2 + (10.5)^2 )

Calculate 26.814²: 26.814 * 26.814. Let me approximate:

26.814^2 = (26 + 0.814)^2 = 26² + 2*26*0.814 + 0.814² = 676 + 42.0 + 0.662 ≈ 718.662

Then 10.5^2 = 110.25

Total |JL|² ≈ 718.662 + 110.25 = 828.912

So |JL| ≈ sqrt(828.912) ≈ 28.8 units.

Now, back to the dot product:

JK · JL ≈ 45 * 26.814 ≈ 1206.63

|JK| = 45, |JL| ≈ 28.8

Thus, cos(theta) ≈ 1206.63 / (45 * 28.8) ≈ 1206.63 / 1296 ≈ 0.9306

Then theta ≈ arccos(0.9306) ≈ 21.5 degrees? Wait, wait. Wait, arccos(0.93) is around 21 degrees? Let me check. Cos(20°) ≈ 0.9397, cos(25°) ≈ 0.9063. So 0.9306 is between 20° and 25°. Let me calculate it more accurately.

Using calculator input: cos⁻¹(0.9306) ≈ ?

Well, let me think. Let me take θ ≈ 21.5 degrees. Let me check cos(21.5):

cos(21.5°) ≈ cos(21°30') ≈ approximately 0.930. Yes, so theta ≈ 21.5 degrees. But this conflicts with the given angles. Wait, but the question asks for angle KJL, which we just calculated as approximately 21.5 degrees. But none of the answer choices are close to that. The options are 30, 40, 50, 60. So this suggests something is wrong. 

Alternatively, perhaps my assumption about the position of points is incorrect. Let me double-check. 

Wait, earlier I assumed that the angle at M is 30 degrees, leading to coordinates of J as (21*cos(30), 21*sin(30)), but perhaps the angle is measured differently. For example, if the angle at M is between JM and ML, but in the parallelogram, the sides at M are JM and ML, which are adjacent sides. So the angle between them is 30 degrees. But in that case, the angle at M is 30 degrees, making the angle at L (which is adjacent) supplementary to it, i.e., 150 degrees. But the problem says angle at L is 70 degrees. So there's a contradiction. 

Wait, but earlier when I computed using coordinates, I got angle KJL ≈ 21.5 degrees, which is not among the options. But the answer choices are A-D, and the options don't include that. So clearly, there's a miscalculation here. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the angle. Let me redo the calculation. 

We have vectors JK and JL. Vector JK is from J to K: (45, 0). Vector JL is from J to L: (45 - x_J, 0 - y_J). Where x_J = 21*cos(30°), y_J = 21*sin(30°). 

So vector JL = (45 - 21*cos(30°), -21*sin(30°))

Vector JK = (45, 0)

Dot product JK · JL = 45*(45 - 21*cos(30°)) + 0*(-21*sin(30°)) = 45*(45 - 21*cos(30°))

Magnitude of JK is 45.

Magnitude of JL is sqrt[(45 - 21*cos(30°))^2 + (21*sin(30°))^2]

Let me expand the magnitude squared:

[45 - 21*cos(30°)]² + [21*sin(30°)]² = 45² - 2*45*21*cos(30°) + [21² cos²(30°) + 21² sin²(30°)] = 45² - 2*45*21*cos(30°) + 21² (cos²(30°) + sin²(30°)) = 45² - 2*45*21*cos(30°) + 21².

Because cos²θ + sin²θ = 1.

So the magnitude of JL is sqrt(45² - 2*45*21*cos(30°) + 21²).

Let me compute this expression:

Let me denote this as sqrt(45² + 21² - 2*45*21*cos(30°)).

Which resembles the law of cosines. Indeed, in triangle JML, where JM = 21, ML = 45, and angle at M is 30°, the length JL would be sqrt(21² + 45² - 2*21*45*cos(30°)). Wait, but JL is not the third side of that triangle. Wait, in triangle JML, the sides are JM=21, ML=45, and JL is the third side. So applying the law of cosines:

JL² = JM² + ML² - 2*JM*ML*cos(angle at M)

So JL² = 21² + 45² - 2*21*45*cos(30°)

Therefore, the magnitude of JL is sqrt(21² + 45² - 2*21*45*cos(30°)).

Now, going back to the dot product:

JK · JL = 45*(45 - 21*cos(30°)).

And |JK| = 45, |JL| = sqrt(21² + 45² - 2*21*45*cos(30°)).

So cos(theta) = [45*(45 - 21*cos(30°))] / [45 * sqrt(...)] = [45 - 21*cos(30°)] / sqrt(21² + 45² - 2*21*45*cos(30°)).

Let me compute numerator and denominator numerically.

First, cos(30°) = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Numerator: 45 - 21*0.8660 ≈ 45 - 18.186 ≈ 26.814.

Denominator: sqrt(21² + 45² - 2*21*45*0.8660)

Compute 21² = 441, 45² = 2025, so total 441 + 2025 = 2466.

Now, compute 2*21*45*0.8660 = 2*21*45*0.8660.

First, 2*21=42, 42*45=1890, 1890*0.8660 ≈ 1890*0.866 ≈ let's calculate 1890*0.8 = 1512, 1890*0.066 ≈ 124.74, total ≈ 1512 + 124.74 = 1636.74.

So denominator inside sqrt is 2466 - 1636.74 ≈ 829.26.

So sqrt(829.26) ≈ 28.8.

So cos(theta) ≈ 26.814 / 28.8 ≈ 0.9306, which is what I had before. So theta ≈ 21.5 degrees. But this doesn't match any answer choices. What's wrong here?

Wait, but the question asks for angle KJL, which we've calculated as approximately 21.5 degrees. None of the answer choices are close to this. This suggests that there's a fundamental error in my assumptions. 

Wait, but the problem states that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram, but the given angles seem to contradict the properties. This implies that perhaps the given angles are not the internal angles of the parallelogram but something else. 

Wait, maybe the given angles are angles formed by the diagonals? For example, in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other and may form certain angles. Let me reconsider. 

In a parallelogram, the diagonals divide it into two congruent triangles. The diagonals intersect at their midpoints. But without knowing the specific lengths, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, perhaps the given angles are not the internal angles but angles formed by the sides and diagonals. For example, angle JML is the angle between JM and ML, which is an internal angle. But if the internal angle at M is 30°, and internal angle at L is 70°, which doesn't satisfy the parallelogram properties. 

Wait, unless the given angles are not the internal angles but external angles? Or perhaps the problem is not a standard parallelogram but a different type of quadrilateral? 

Wait, let me revisit the problem statement. It says "Use parallelogram J K L M". So it's definitely a parallelogram. But the given angles seem contradictory. Perhaps the error is in assuming that angle JML is the internal angle at M. Maybe it's an external angle? Or perhaps the labeling is different. 

Let me try a different approach. Since it's a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. Let's denote the angles at each vertex. Let's call angle at J as α, at K as β, at L as γ, and at M as δ. In a parallelogram, α = γ and β = δ. Also, α + β = 180°, and β + γ = 180°, etc. 

Given that angle JML is 30°, which is angle at M between J and L. So that is angle δ. Similarly, angle KLM is 70°, which is angle at L between K and M, which is angle γ. So δ = 30°, γ = 70°. But in a parallelogram, α = γ = 70°, and β = δ = 30°. Then, the sum of angles at J and K would be 70 + 30 = 100°, which is not 180°, violating the property that consecutive angles are supplementary. 

This suggests that the given data is inconsistent with the properties of a parallelogram. But since the problem says it is a parallelogram, there must be an error in my interpretation of the angles. 

Wait, maybe the given angles are not at the vertices but somewhere else. For example, angle JML could be an angle formed by extending sides or something. Alternatively, perhaps the diagram is not convex? 

Alternatively, perhaps the given angles are not the internal angles but the angles between the diagonals and the sides? For example, in a parallelogram, the diagonals create angles with the sides. 

Let me think: suppose angle JML is the angle between diagonal JM and side ML. In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, but they don't necessarily form right angles. 

Let me consider the diagonals. In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. Let's say diagonals are JL and KM. The intersection point O is the midpoint of both diagonals. 

But I'm not sure how this helps. 

Alternatively, let me think about triangle JML. In this triangle, we know two sides: JM = 21, ML = 45, and angle at M is 30 degrees. Using the Law of Sines, we can find other angles. 

Law of Sines: In triangle JML, 
sin(angle at J) / ML = sin(angle at M) / JL

Wait, but we don't know JL. But we can compute JL using the Law of Cosines. 

As before, JL² = 21² + 45² - 2*21*45*cos(30°). Let's calculate this:

JL² = 441 + 2025 - 2*21*45*(√3/2) = 2466 - 21*45*√3

Calculate 21*45 = 945. So JL² = 2466 - 945√3 ≈ 2466 - 945*1.732 ≈ 2466 - 1635.54 ≈ 830.46

Thus, JL ≈ sqrt(830.46) ≈ 28.82.

Now, using Law of Sines in triangle JML:

sin(angle at J) / ML = sin(angle at M) / JL

So sin(angle at J) = ML * sin(angle at M) / JL

ML = 45, angle at M = 30°, JL ≈ 28.82

Thus, sin(angle at J) = 45 * sin(30°) / 28.82 ≈ 45 * 0.5 / 28.82 ≈ 22.5 / 28.82 ≈ 0.780.

So angle at J ≈ arcsin(0.780) ≈ 51.2 degrees. 

Similarly, angle at L in triangle JML is 180 - 30 - 51.2 = 98.8 degrees. 

But in the parallelogram, angle at L is supposed to be equal to angle at J (since opposite angles are equal). But here, angle at L in triangle JML is 98.8 degrees, which would mean angle at L in the parallelogram is 98.8 degrees, and angle at J is 51.2 degrees. But then, consecutive angles would be 98.8 + 51.2 = 150 degrees, which is not 180. Still inconsistency. 

This suggests that the given data is conflicting. But since the problem states it is a parallelogram, there must be a different interpretation. 

Wait, perhaps the given angles are not in the triangle JML, but elsewhere. Let me reconsider the angle definitions. 

Angle(J,M,L) is the angle at M between J and L, which is the angle between MJ and ML. In the parallelogram, this is the internal angle at M. Similarly, angle(K,L,M) is the angle at L between K and M, which is the internal angle at L. 

But if these internal angles are 30° and 70°, respectively, then in a parallelogram, the opposite angles should be equal. So angle at M = angle at L = 30° and 70°, which is not possible. Therefore, the only way this makes sense is if the given angles are not the internal angles but something else. 

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different definition of the angle. For example, in some contexts, angle(J,M,L) could refer to the angle at M between JM and ML, but in the parallelogram, this is the internal angle. But if the parallelogram is not convex, then the internal angle could be reflex (greater than 180°). But even then, the sum of consecutive angles would still need to be 180°. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem contains a typo, and the intended angles were different. But assuming the problem is correct, I need to find another approach. 

Wait, the question asks for angle KJL. Let me consider triangle KJL. Points K, J, L. We need to find angle at J. 

From earlier calculations, using the coordinates, we found this angle to be approximately 21.5 degrees, which is not among the options. But maybe there's an error in the calculation. 

Let me try to compute it using exact expressions. 

We had:

cos(theta) = [45 - 21*cos(30°)] / sqrt(21² + 45² - 2*21*45*cos(30°))

Let me plug in exact values. 

Let me denote cos(30°) as √3/2. So:

Numerator: 45 - 21*(√3/2) = 45 - (21√3)/2

Denominator: sqrt(21² + 45² - 2*21*45*(√3/2)) = sqrt(441 + 2025 - 21*45√3) = sqrt(2466 - 945√3)

So cos(theta) = [45 - (21√3)/2] / sqrt(2466 - 945√3)

To simplify this expression, let's rationalize or find a relationship. Let me square both numerator and denominator to see if it simplifies.

Let me compute numerator squared: [45 - (21√3)/2]^2 = 45² - 2*45*(21√3)/2 + [(21√3)/2]^2 = 2025 - 45*21√3 + (441*3)/4 = 2025 - 945√3 + 1323/4 = convert to common denominator:

2025 = 8100/4, 1323/4 remains. So total: (8100 + 1323)/4 - 945√3 = 9423/4 - 945√3.

Denominator squared is 2466 - 945√3 = 2466 - 945√3. 

So the ratio of numerator squared to denominator squared is [9423/4 - 945√3]/[2466 - 945√3]. Let me factor out 945 from the numerator and denominator. 

Wait, 9423/4 is approximately 2355.75, and 2466 is larger. Not helpful. 

Alternatively, notice that 945 = 21*45. Let me see. 

But this seems too abstract. Perhaps there's a trigonometric identity or relation I'm missing. 

Alternatively, let me consider that in the parallelogram, the sum of angles at J and M should be 180°, but given that angle at M is 30°, angle at J should be 150°. But earlier calculations suggested otherwise. 

Wait, if angle at J is 150°, then angle KJL would be part of that. Wait, angle KJL is at J, between K and L. In the parallelogram, at point J, the sides are JK and JL. Wait, but JL is a diagonal, not a side. So angle KJL is not one of the internal angles of the parallelogram, but an angle formed by side JK and diagonal JL. 

So in this case, if the internal angle at J is 150°, and we're finding the angle between side JK and diagonal JL, which would be a portion of that 150°. 

But how to calculate it? Let me think. 

If we know the internal angle at J is 150°, and we want to find the angle between JK and JL, we need to know the relationship between the sides and the diagonal. 

In the parallelogram, the diagonal JL divides the parallelogram into two triangles. In triangle JKL, we have sides JK = 45, KL = 21, and JL. Wait, but we already calculated JL as approximately 28.82. 

So in triangle JKL, sides are JK = 45, KL = 21, and JL ≈ 28.82. We can use the Law of Cosines to find the angle at J, which is angle KJL. 

Wait, that's exactly what I did earlier, giving approximately 21.5 degrees. But this contradicts the expected answer choices. 

However, since the answer choices are 30, 40, 50, 60, and my calculation gives approximately 21.5, which is not among them, I must conclude that there's a mistake in the problem or my interpretation. 

Wait, let me check if I mixed up the angles. Maybe the given angle at M is 30°, and at L is 70°, but in a parallelogram, the sum of these two angles should be 180°, but they are 100°, so the remaining angles would be 80° each. Wait, but how? 

Let me try to assume that the given angles are not the internal angles but the angles between the diagonals and the sides. For example, in a parallelogram, the diagonals split the angles into two parts. 

Suppose angle between diagonal JL and side JM is 30°, and angle between diagonal JL and side LM is 70°. But this is speculative. 

Alternatively, let me think about the fact that in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. Let me consider the diagonals JL and KM intersecting at point O. 

If angle at M is 30°, and at L is 70°, maybe these are angles formed by the diagonals? 

This is getting too vague. Given the time I've
