MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out what they mean. Let me start by listing them out again:

1. RightAngle(Angle(A,C,B)) – So angle at point C between points A, C, B is a right angle. That means triangle ABC has a right angle at C.
2. Right(Triangle(A,B,C)) – This confirms that triangle ABC is a right triangle. Wait, but since we already have a right angle at C from the first predicate, this just reinforces that it's a right-angled triangle at C.
3. Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,C)),60) – The measure of angle at A, between points B, A, C is 60 degrees. So angle BAC is 60°.
4. Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)),10) – Length AB is 10 units.
5. Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C)),x) – AC is x, which is what we need to find.
6. Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)),y) – BC is y, but maybe we don't need this directly.

So, putting this together, triangle ABC is right-angled at C, with angle at A being 60°, and side AB = 10. We need to find the length of AC, which is x.

Let me sketch this mentally. In triangle ABC, right-angled at C. So sides AC and BC are the legs, and AB is the hypotenuse. But wait, if angle at A is 60°, then the other angles would be... Well, in a right-angled triangle, the two non-right angles add up to 90°. Since one of them is 60°, the other must be 30°. So angle at B is 30°, because angles sum to 180°: 90 + 60 + 30 = 180.

Now, in a right-angled triangle with angles 30°, 60°, 90°, the sides are in a specific ratio. Remember that the sides opposite these angles are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. Specifically, the side opposite 30° is half the hypotenuse. Wait, let me recall:

In a 30-60-90 triangle:
- The side opposite 30° is the shortest leg, let's say length 'a'.
- The side opposite 60° is longer leg, length 'a√3'.
- The hypotenuse is 2a.

But here, angle at A is 60°, so the side opposite angle A (which is BC) should be the longer leg. Wait, let me confirm:

Angle at A is 60°, so the side opposite angle A is BC. Because in triangle ABC, angle at A is between BA and CA. Therefore, the side opposite angle A is BC. Similarly, angle at B is 30°, so the side opposite angle B is AC. And the hypotenuse is AB.

Therefore, according to the ratios:

BC (opposite 60°) = a√3
AC (opposite 30°) = a
AB (hypotenuse) = 2a

Given that AB is 10, so 2a = 10 → a = 5. Then AC, which is opposite 30°, is a = 5. Therefore, x = 5? But wait, let me check again.

Wait, hold on. If angle at A is 60°, then the side opposite to angle A is BC. So BC is opposite 60°, making it the longer leg. Then AC is opposite angle B, which is 30°, so that's the shorter leg. Hypotenuse AB is 10. So the ratio would be:

Shorter leg (AC) : Longer leg (BC) : Hypotenuse (AB) = 1 : √3 : 2

So if hypotenuse AB is 10, then shorter leg AC = (1/2)*hypotenuse = 5. Therefore, x = 5. Which would correspond to answer A. But wait, let me make sure there isn't a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps I mixed up the angles. Let me verify:

In triangle ABC, right-angled at C. So angles at A and B are complementary. Given angle at A is 60°, so angle at B is 30°. Then:

- Side opposite angle A (60°): BC
- Side opposite angle B (30°): AC
- Hypotenuse AB

So yes, BC is opposite 60°, AC is opposite 30°, so AC is the shorter leg. Therefore, AC = (AB)/2 = 10/2 = 5. Hence x=5. So answer A?

But looking at the options, answer A is 5. However, sometimes people confuse which side is which. Let me double-check using trigonometry.

Using trigonometry, in triangle ABC, right-angled at C. So cos(angle at A) = adjacent / hypotenuse. Angle at A is 60°, adjacent side is AC, hypotenuse is AB. So:

cos(60°) = AC / AB → AC = AB * cos(60°). Cos(60°) is 0.5, so AC = 10 * 0.5 = 5. So that confirms x=5. So answer A. But why is there an option B as 5√2? Maybe if someone thought it was a different triangle. Alternatively, if the angle was at a different vertex.

Wait, another way: Using Pythagoras. Suppose AC = x, BC = y, AB = 10. Since it's a right triangle at C, x² + y² = 10² = 100.

Also, angle at A is 60°, so tan(60°) = opposite / adjacent = BC / AC = y/x. Tan(60°) is √3. So y/x = √3 → y = x√3.

Substitute into Pythagoras:

x² + (x√3)^2 = 100 → x² + 3x² = 4x² = 100 → x² = 25 → x = 5. So same result. Therefore, x=5. Answer A.

But wait, the answer choices include option C as 5√3. Could there be confusion about which angle is where? For example, if angle at B was 60°, then AC would be longer. But in our case, angle at A is 60°, so AC is shorter. So answer A. So the correct answer is A. But why is there an option C? Maybe if someone thought angle at B was 60°, leading to AC being longer. But according to the given, angle at A is 60°, so that's not the case.

Thus, the correct answer is A. But wait, let me check once more. Let me imagine the triangle. Point C is the right angle. So points A and B are connected to C. AB is the hypotenuse. So angle at A is between BA and CA. So if angle at A is 60°, then the triangle has angles 60°, 30°, 90°, with hypotenuse AB=10. Then the side opposite 30° (angle at B) is AC. Therefore, AC is half the hypotenuse, so 5. Yes. So answer A is correct. So Final Answer: A.
