====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, C, X. There are several triangles mentioned: Triangle(A,B,C), Triangle(A,X,B), Triangle(A,X,C). Also, there are some length equalities and right angles. The goal is to find x. 

First, I need to parse all the given predicates. Let me list them again:

- Points A, B, C, X.
- Triangles: ABC, AXB, AXC.
- Lengths:
   - Length(B,C) = 3x
   - Length(A,B) = 8
   - Length(A,C) = 6
   - Length(A,X) = x
   - Length(X,C) = Length(A,B) → so X to C equals 8
   - Length(X,B) = Length(A,C) → so X to B equals 6
- Angles:
   - Angle at B in triangle ABC is a right angle (RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C))).
   - Angle at C in triangle AXC is a right angle (RightAngle(Angle(A,X,C))).

So, first, since there's a right angle at B in triangle ABC, that means triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with right angle at B. Therefore, AB and BC are the legs, and AC is the hypotenuse? Wait, wait. Wait, the right angle is at B, so sides AB and BC are perpendicular. So AB is one leg, BC is another leg, and AC is the hypotenuse. But according to the given lengths, AB is 8 units, BC is 3x units, and AC should be sqrt(AB² + BC²) by Pythagoras. However, we also know that AC is given as 6? Wait, no. Wait, the length of AC isn't directly given. Wait, the given data says Length(A,C) is 6. Wait, but if ABC is a right triangle with legs AB=8 and BC=3x, then AC would be sqrt(8² + (3x)^2). But according to the problem, Length(A,C) is 6. That seems conflicting unless there's a miscalculation here. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the triangle structure.

Wait, hold on. The triangle ABC has a right angle at B. So AB and BC are the legs. Then AC is the hypotenuse. But according to the given data, the length of AC is 6. So applying Pythagoras:

AB² + BC² = AC² → 8² + (3x)^2 = 6² → 64 + 9x² = 36 → 9x² = 36 - 64 → 9x² = -28. Which is impossible because squares can't be negative. Hmm, that suggests something's wrong here. Maybe my assumption about which sides are legs and hypotenuse is incorrect?

Wait, perhaps the right angle is not at B? Wait, the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)). In standard notation, Angle(A,B,C) refers to the angle at point B between points A and C. So yes, the right angle is at B. So that implies AB and BC are perpendicular. So then AC would be the hypotenuse. But then according to the given lengths, AB is 8, BC is 3x, and AC is 6. Which leads to a contradiction as above. Therefore, there must be an error in my understanding.

Alternatively, maybe the triangle ABC is not a right triangle? No, the predicate explicitly states it is right-angled at B. So this seems contradictory. Unless there's a mistake in interpreting the given lengths.

Wait, let me check again. The given lengths:

Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)),8) → AB = 8

Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C)),6) → AC = 6

But if ABC is a right triangle with right angle at B, then AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2. Substituting AB=8 and AC=6 gives 64 + BC² = 36 → BC² = -28, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that either the problem has conflicting constraints, or I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, but the problem must have a solution. So where am I going wrong? Let me re-examine the problem statement.

Ah! Wait, the given LengthOf(Line(B,C)) is 3x. So BC = 3x. And AC is given as 6. So substituting into Pythagoras:

AB² + BC² = AC² → 8² + (3x)^2 = 6² → 64 + 9x² = 36 → 9x² = -28. Still impossible. So this suggests inconsistency. Therefore, there must be something wrong with my interpretation.

Wait, could the right angle be at a different vertex? For example, maybe the right angle is at A instead of B? But the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)), which is the angle at B. So that's fixed. Alternatively, maybe the triangle ABC isn't right-angled? But the problem states it is. This seems like a contradiction. Therefore, maybe there's another configuration?

Alternatively, perhaps triangle ABC isn't a right triangle, but the other triangles are? Wait, no. The problem says Triangle(A,B,C) is right-angled at B. So that must be true.

Hmm. This suggests that there's a conflict in the given data. But since the problem exists, there must be a way to resolve this. Perhaps I misread the given lengths? Let me check again.

Wait, the problem says:

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)),3x)

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)),8)

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C)),6)

So BC = 3x, AB = 8, AC = 6. So in triangle ABC, with right angle at B, AB=8, BC=3x, and AC=6. So as before, 8² + (3x)^2 = 6². Which is impossible. Hence, this suggests that there's a mistake in the problem setup. But since the problem is given, perhaps there's another relationship I haven't considered yet.

Wait, maybe the triangle ABC is not a right triangle? But the problem says it is. Wait, unless the right angle is not part of triangle ABC. But the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)), which is part of triangle ABC. So that's confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the right angle is at point A? Wait, no, the angle is specified as Angle(A,B,C), which is the angle at B. So that's fixed.

Wait, maybe there's a typo in the problem? Or maybe I need to consider another triangle. Let's look at the other triangles. We have Triangle(A,X,B) and Triangle(A,X,C). Also, there are right angles at Angle(A,X,C). So, in triangle AXC, the right angle is at C. So in triangle AXC, angle at C is right. So that would make AC and CX perpendicular. Wait, but in triangle AXC, if angle at C is right, then AC and XC are the legs, and AX is the hypotenuse. Given that AX = x, and XC is given as Length(X,C) equals Length(A,B) which is 8. So XC = 8. Therefore, in triangle AXC, right-angled at C: AC² + CX² = AX². But AC is given as 6, CX is 8, so 6² + 8² = 36 + 64 = 100 = AX² → AX = 10. But the problem states that Length(A,X) is x. Therefore, x = 10. But none of the answer choices includes 10. The options are A.3, B.4, C.5, D.6. So this suggests that x=10, but that's not among the choices. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. 

This indicates that there's a fundamental issue with the problem's constraints. However, since the problem is presented as solvable, I must have made a wrong assumption. Let me go back step by step.

Let me re-express all given data:

Given:

Points A, B, C, X.

Triangles:

- Triangle ABC: right-angled at B.

- Triangle AXB: ?

- Triangle AXC: right-angled at C.

Lengths:

- AB = 8

- AC = 6

- BC = 3x

- AX = x

- XC = AB = 8

- XB = AC = 6

Angles:

- Right angle at B in ABC.

- Right angle at C in AXC.

So, in triangle AXC, right-angled at C. Therefore, by Pythagoras:

AX² = AC² + CX² → x² = 6² + 8² → x² = 36 + 64 = 100 → x = 10. But answer choices don't have 10. So that's a problem. 

But the problem gives options up to 6. Therefore, this suggests that perhaps there is an error in the problem statement, or perhaps my interpretation is wrong. 

Wait, maybe the right angle in triangle AXC is at X instead of C? Because the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(A,X,C)), which is the angle at X between A and C. Wait, no. The notation Angle(A,X,C) means the angle at X formed by points A, X, C. So that's the angle at X. Therefore, triangle AXC has a right angle at X. Therefore, the legs are AX and XC, and hypotenuse AC. Wait, but then AC would be the hypotenuse. So AC² = AX² + XC². Given AC is 6, AX is x, XC is 8. Therefore:

6² = x² + 8² → 36 = x² + 64 → x² = -28. Again impossible. So same problem. 

This suggests that there is a contradiction in the given data. However, since the problem is presented as having a solution, I must have misunderstood the configuration. Let me think differently. 

Perhaps the right angle in triangle AXC is at A? But the predicate says Angle(A,X,C), which is the angle at X. So that's not possible. 

Wait, perhaps the triangles are not all in the same plane? Unlikely, since it's a typical geometry problem. 

Alternatively, perhaps the triangles are not right-angled in the way I thought. Let me double-check the angle notation. 

In standard terms, Angle(A,B,C) is the angle at point B between points A and C. Similarly, Angle(A,X,C) is the angle at point X between points A and C. So in triangle AXC, the right angle is at X. Therefore, AX and XC are perpendicular. Thus, in triangle AXC, right-angled at X, so AC² = AX² + XC². As before, leading to x² = AC² - XC². But AC is 6, XC is 8, so x² = 36 - 64 = -28. Impossible. 

Therefore, there's a contradiction here. But the problem must have a solution. Let me check the other triangle, triangle AXB. Is there any info about it? The predicate says Triangle(A,X,B). Are there any other given conditions about it? Not directly. But perhaps there are relations via coordinates?

Maybe assigning coordinates to the points would help. Let me try coordinate geometry.

Let me place point B at the origin (0,0) since there's a right angle at B. Since triangle ABC is right-angled at B, let me assume coordinates:

Let’s set B at (0,0). Since AB = 8, and assuming AB is along the x-axis, then point A is at (8,0). Now, since triangle ABC is right-angled at B, BC is perpendicular to AB. Since AB is horizontal, BC would be vertical. Let me assume BC is along the y-axis. So point C is at (0, y), where y is the length BC = 3x. So coordinates:

A: (8,0)

B: (0,0)

C: (0, 3x)

Now, compute AC. The distance between A(8,0) and C(0, 3x) is sqrt((8-0)^2 + (0 - 3x)^2) = sqrt(64 + 9x²). According to the problem, AC = 6. Therefore:

sqrt(64 + 9x²) = 6 → square both sides: 64 + 9x² = 36 → 9x² = -28 → x² = -28/9. Which is impossible. So this confirms the earlier contradiction. 

Thus, there's no real solution under these assumptions. This suggests that the problem may have conflicting constraints. But since the problem asks to find x, there must be a resolution. Where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the right angle in triangle ABC is not at B? But the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)), which is at B. 

Alternatively, maybe the right angle in triangle ABC is at A? If that were the case, then AB and AC would be perpendicular. But the problem states the right angle is at B. 

Alternatively, maybe the triangle ABC is not a right triangle, but the other triangles are? No, the problem states that Triangle(A,B,C) is right-angled at B. 

Wait, could the problem involve three-dimensional geometry? Probably not, since it's a typical plane geometry problem. 

Alternatively, perhaps the lengths given are not Euclidean distances? Unlikely, as per standard geometry problems. 

Alternatively, maybe the given lengths refer to vectors or something else? No, the problem mentions Line segments, so they're lengths. 

At this point, I'm stuck because the given data seems inconsistent. However, since the problem expects an answer, I must consider that perhaps I misread the given lengths. Let me recheck:

Original problem says:

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)),3x)

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)),8)

- Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C)),6)

Yes. So BC = 3x, AB = 8, AC = 6. 

And for triangle AXC, which is right-angled at C. So AX = x, XC = AB = 8, AC = 6. So using Pythagoras on triangle AXC: AX² + XC² = AC² → x² + 8² = 6² → x² = 36 - 64 = -28. No solution. 

But the problem says to choose from A-D. Maybe there's a different configuration where triangle ABC is not right-angled? But the problem says it is. 

Wait, what if the right angle in triangle ABC is at C instead of B? Let me try that. Suppose the right angle is at C. Then, AC and BC are perpendicular. Let me assign coordinates accordingly. 

Set C at (0,0). Since AC = 6, and BC = 3x. Let me say point A is at (6,0), and point B is somewhere such that BC = 3x and angle at C is right. Then, AB would be the hypotenuse. But then AB = 8. So AB² = AC² + BC² → 8² = 6² + (3x)^2 → 64 = 36 + 9x² → 9x² = 28 → x² = 28/9 → x = sqrt(28)/3 ≈ 5.29... Not matching any answer choices. 

Still not helpful. 

Alternatively, if the right angle is at A. So AB and AC are perpendicular. Then, AB = 8, AC = 6, so BC would be sqrt(8² + 6²) = 10. But BC is given as 3x. So 3x = 10 → x = 10/3 ≈ 3.333..., which isn't an option either. 

Hmm. None of these give an integer x. 

But the problem must have an answer. Let me think about the other parts. What about triangle AXB? It's a triangle with points A, X, B. We know AX = x, AB = 8, and XB = AC = 6. So in triangle AXB, sides are AX = x, XB = 6, AB = 8. So by triangle inequality, x + 6 > 8 → x > 2; 6 + 8 > x → x < 14; and x + 8 > 6 → x > -2. So x must be between 2 and 14. 

But how does this relate to the other information? 

Also, there's the right angle at C in triangle AXC. So in triangle AXC, right-angled at C, so AX² + XC² = AC² → x² + 8² = 6² → x² = -28. Still impossible. 

Unless there's a mistake in the problem's given data, or perhaps the right angle is at X instead of C in triangle AXC. If that's the case, then in triangle AXC, right-angled at X, so AC² = AX² + XC² → 6² = x² + 8² → x² = 36 - 64 = -28. Same issue. 

Wait, what if the right angle is at A in triangle AXC? Then, AX and AC would be perpendicular. So AX² + AC² = XC² → x² + 6² = 8² → x² = 64 - 36 = 28 → x = sqrt(28) ≈ 5.29. Still not matching answer choices. 

Alternatively, if the right angle is at B in triangle AXC? But that would mean points A, X, C form a right angle at B, but B is already part of triangle ABC. This seems complicated. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem's given data, such as the right angle being at a different location. 

Alternatively, maybe the length of AC is not 6, but something else? Let me check again. 

Original problem says: Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C)),6). Yes. 

Wait, perhaps I need to use coordinates with variables and find equations. Let me try that. 

Assume point B is at (0,0), as before. AB is 8, so A is at (8,0). Since ABC is right-angled at B, C is at (0, y), where y = BC = 3x. So C is (0, 3x). Then AC is from (8,0) to (0,3x), so its length is sqrt(8² + (3x)^2) = 6. So:

sqrt(64 + 9x²) = 6 → 64 + 9x² = 36 → 9x² = -28 → x² = -28/9. No solution. 

Same problem. 

Now, looking at triangle AXC. Points A(8,0), X(?), C(0,3x). We know that XC = 8 (since XC = AB = 8), and AX = x. Also, triangle AXC has a right angle at C. So vector CX is from C to X, and vector CA is from C to A. Since the right angle is at C, vectors CX and CA should be perpendicular. 

Vector CA is A - C = (8 - 0, 0 - 3x) = (8, -3x). Vector CX is X - C = (Xx - 0, Xy - 3x) = (Xx, Xy - 3x). Their dot product should be zero:

CA · CX = 8*Xx + (-3x)*(Xy - 3x) = 0 → 8Xx - 3x(Xy - 3x) = 0 → 8Xx - 3xXy + 9x² = 0.

Additionally, the length of XC is 8, so sqrt((Xx)^2 + (Xy - 3x)^2) = 8 → (Xx)^2 + (Xy - 3x)^2 = 64.

Also, the length of AX is x: sqrt((Xx - 8)^2 + (Xy - 0)^2) = x → (Xx - 8)^2 + Xy² = x².

So we have three equations:

1. 8Xx - 3xXy + 9x² = 0

2. Xx² + (Xy - 3x)^2 = 64

3. (Xx - 8)^2 + Xy² = x²

These are three equations with variables Xx, Xy, x. Solving this system might give us x. 

But this seems very involved. Let me see if we can find a relation. From equation 1: 8Xx - 3xXy = -9x² → 8Xx = 3xXy - 9x² → Xx = (3xXy - 9x²)/8.

Substitute this into equation 3:

[( (3xXy - 9x²)/8 ) - 8]^2 + Xy² = x².

This looks complicated. Maybe there's another approach. 

Alternatively, since we have two expressions involving Xx and Xy, perhaps express everything in terms of Xy and x. But this might take too long. 

Alternatively, let's assume that x is one of the answer choices and test them. 

Answer choices are A.3, B.4, C.5, D.6. 

Let me try each possibility. 

Start with option C: x=5. 

Then, BC = 3x = 15. So point C is at (0,15). 

AC is supposed to be 6, but distance from A(8,0) to C(0,15) is sqrt(8² + 15²) = sqrt(64+225)=sqrt(289)=17. Which contradicts AC=6. So invalid. 

Option B: x=4. Then BC = 3*4=12. Point C is (0,12). Distance AC is sqrt(8² + 12²)=sqrt(64+144)=sqrt(208)=~14.4, not 6. Invalid. 

Option A: x=3. BC=9. AC=sqrt(64+81)=sqrt(145)≈12.04. Not 6. 

Option D: x=6. BC=18. AC=sqrt(64+324)=sqrt(388)≈19.7. Not 6. 

None of these work. 

This suggests that none of the answer choices satisfy the given conditions. However, since the problem must have an answer, there must be a mistake in my reasoning. 

Wait, perhaps the right angle in triangle AXC is not at C, but at X? Let me try that. 

If triangle AXC is right-angled at X, then AX and XC are perpendicular. So vectors XA and XC are perpendicular. 

Point A is (8,0), point C is (0,3x), point X is (Xx, Xy). 

Vector XA = A - X = (8 - Xx, 0 - Xy)

Vector XC = C - X = (0 - Xx, 3x - Xy)

Their dot product should be zero:

(8 - Xx)(-Xx) + (-Xy)(3x - Xy) = 0 → -8Xx + Xx² - 3xXy + Xy² = 0. 

Also, length of XC is 8: sqrt((-Xx)^2 + (3x - Xy)^2) = 8 → Xx² + (3x - Xy)^2 = 64.

Length of AX is x: sqrt((8 - Xx)^2 + (0 - Xy)^2) = x → (8 - Xx)^2 + Xy² = x².

So we have:

Equation 1: -8Xx + Xx² - 3xXy + Xy² = 0.

Equation 2: Xx² + (3x - Xy)^2 = 64.

Equation 3: (8 - Xx)^2 + Xy² = x².

Again, this seems complex. Let me expand equation 2: Xx² + 9x² - 6xXy + Xy² = 64.

From equation 1: Xx² + Xy² - 8Xx - 3xXy = 0.

Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

[ Xx² + 9x² - 6xXy + Xy² ] - [ Xx² + Xy² - 8Xx - 3xXy ] = 64 - 0 → 

9x² - 6xXy - (-8Xx -3xXy) = 64 → 

9x² -6xXy +8Xx +3xXy = 64 → 

9x² -3xXy +8Xx = 64. 

Let me call this equation 4: 9x² -3xXy +8Xx = 64.

From equation 3: (8 - Xx)^2 + Xy² = x² → 64 - 16Xx + Xx² + Xy² = x² → Xx² + Xy² = x² + 16Xx -64. 

But from equation 1: Xx² + Xy² = 8Xx + 3xXy. 

So setting equal: 8Xx + 3xXy = x² + 16Xx -64 → 

8Xx + 3xXy - x² -16Xx +64 = 0 → 

-8Xx + 3xXy - x² +64 = 0 → 

Which rearranges to: 3xXy -8Xx = x² -64. 

Let me note this as equation 5: 3xXy -8Xx = x² -64.

Now, from equation 4: 9x² -3xXy +8Xx = 64. Let me substitute 3xXy from equation 5. 

From equation 5: 3xXy = 8Xx + x² -64. 

Substitute into equation 4: 

9x² - (8Xx + x² -64) +8Xx = 64 → 

9x² -8Xx -x² +64 +8Xx = 64 → 

(9x² -x²) + (-8Xx +8Xx) +64 = 64 → 

8x² + 64 = 64 → 

8x² = 0 → x² = 0 → x=0. 

Which is impossible, since x is a length. 

This suggests that there's no solution under these conditions. 

This is perplexing. All paths lead to contradictions. Perhaps the problem contains a typo, or I'm missing something. 

Wait, let me revisit the original problem statement. The user wrote:

"Triangle(A,X,B)" and "Triangle(A,X,C)". Are these triangles right-angled? Only the ones specified in the predicates. The right angle in Triangle(A,X,C) is specified, and the right angle in Triangle(A,B,C) is specified. 

But what about the other triangles? Like, is there a right angle in Triangle(A,X,B)? Not necessarily. 

Wait, but the problem says RightAngle(Angle(A,X,C)), so only triangle AXC has a right angle at C. 

Let me try to think differently. Maybe the triangles are not in the same plane? Or perhaps there's a reflection or something. 

Alternatively, maybe the length of AC is not 6, but something else? Let me check again. 

Original problem: Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C)),6). Yes. 

Wait, what if the right angle in triangle ABC is not at B, but at C? Let me try that. 

If triangle ABC is right-angled at C, then AC and BC are perpendicular. Let me assign coordinates:

Let C be at (0,0). Since AC = 6, let me put A at (6,0). BC = 3x, so B is at (0, 3x). Then AB is the hypotenuse. 

Compute AB: distance between A(6,0) and B(0,3x): sqrt(6² + (3x)^2) = sqrt(36 + 9x²). Given AB = 8, so sqrt(36 + 9x²) = 8 → 36 + 9x² = 64 → 9x² = 28 → x² = 28/9 → x = sqrt(28)/3 ≈ 5.29. Not an answer choice. 

But if we proceed, then for triangle AXC, which is right-angled at C. So point X is such that XC = AB = 8, and AX = x. Let me see. 

Since C is at (0,0), and XC = 8. So X lies somewhere on a circle of radius 8 around C. Also, AX = x. So point X is at distance x from A(6,0), and distance 8 from C(0,0). 

So the intersection of two circles: one centered at A(6,0) with radius x, and one at C(0,0) with radius 8. 

The distance between centers is 6 units. The intersection exists if |8 - x| ≤ 6 ≤ 8 + x. 

For x = sqrt(28)/3 ≈ 5.29, let's see: 8 - x ≈ 8 - 5.29 = 2.71, which is less than 6, and 8 + x ≈ 13.29 ≥ 6. So there are two intersection points. 

But this doesn't directly help with finding x, since x is determined from the right angle condition. 

However, this still doesn't provide an integer x. 

At this point, I'm forced to conclude that there is likely an error in the problem's given data, or perhaps I've missed a key insight. Given the answer choices, and the fact that the only consistent calculation in the triangle AXC (assuming right angle at C) gave x² = -28, which is impossible, but if we ignore the sign, x = sqrt(28) ≈ 5.29, which is close to option C (5). Perhaps the problem assumes ignoring the negative sign and taking the absolute value, leading to x = sqrt(28) ≈ 5.29, which is approximately 5, hence choosing option C. 

Alternatively, if the right angle in triangle AXC is at X, and there was a miscalculation, let's recompute:

If triangle AXC is right-angled at X, then AC² = AX² + XC² → 6² = x² + 8² → x² = 36 - 64 = -28. Still no good. 

But if we assume that the length of AC is not 6, but the length of BC is 6, and AC is 8? Let me try swapping. 

Wait, original data says LengthOf(Line(A,C)) = 6, and LengthOf(Line(B,C)) = 3x. 

If I mistakenly assumed AC = 8 and BC = 6, then in triangle ABC right-angled at B: AB=8, BC=6, AC= sqrt(8² + 6²)=10. Then, for triangle AXC, right-angled at C: AX = x, XC = AB = 8, AC = 10. So 10² = x² + 8² → x² = 100 - 64 = 36 → x = 6. Which is option D. 

But this requires swapping AC and BC, which is not what the problem states. However, if there was a typo in the problem, and the length of AC is 8 and BC is 6, then x=6. But since the problem states AC=6 and BC=3x, this is just speculation. 

Given that option D is 6, and if we assume that there was a mix-up in the given lengths, this might be the intended answer. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that LengthOf(Line(A,B)) = 6, and LengthOf(Line(A,C)) = 8. Let's try that. 

If AB = 6, AC = 8, BC = 3x, right-angled at B. Then AC² = AB² + BC² → 8² = 6² + (3x)^2 → 64 = 36 + 9x² → 9x² = 28 → x = sqrt(28)/3 ≈ 5.29. Still not an option. 

But if instead, the right angle is at A, making AB and AC perpendicular, then BC = sqrt(AB² + AC²) = sqrt(6² + 8²) = 10. So 3x = 10 → x = 10/3 ≈ 3.33, not matching. 

Alternatively, if the right angle is at C, making AC and BC perpendicular, then AB = sqrt(AC² + BC²) = sqrt(6² + (3x)^2). Given AB = 8, so 64 = 36 + 9x² → 9x² = 28 → x = sqrt(28)/3. 

Still no match. 

Given the lack of a valid solution under the given data, but needing to choose from the options, the closest possible is option C (5), assuming a possible miscalculation where x² = 28, giving x = sqrt(28) ≈ 5.29, which rounds to 5. 

Hence, the answer is C.
