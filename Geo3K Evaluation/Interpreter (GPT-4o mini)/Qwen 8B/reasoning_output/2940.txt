Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a circle X with several points on it: A, B, C, D, Y, Z, M, N. There are lines connecting some of these points, like Line(A,B), Line(A,Y), Line(M,N), etc. Also, there are right angles mentioned at Angle(Y,M,A) and Angle(C,N,Z). Plus, some points lie on the circle, and certain arc measures are given. The question asks for the measure of arc CD, given that AB is 30 units, CD is 30 units, and the measure of arc CZ is 40 degrees. The options are A. 30, B. 40, C. 60, D. 80.

First, I need to visualize the diagram based on the given predicates. Let me list out all the given information again:

- Points A, B, C, D, Y, Z, M, N are on circle X.
- Lines: AB, AY, MN, NZ, YM, DZ, CZ.
- Right angles at ∠YMA and ∠CNZ.
- Arcs: AB = 30 (probably chord length?), CD = 30 (chord length?), arc CZ = 40°, find arc CD.

Wait, hold on. Wait, the problem says "AB = 30" and "CD = 30". But in circle problems, sometimes AB could refer to the arc measure or the chord length. However, since they mention m∠CZ = 40, which is an arc measure, so maybe AB and CD here refer to chord lengths? Or maybe arcs?

But the problem also mentions "m∠CZ", which is arc measure. So perhaps AB and CD are chords. But the problem says "AB = 30, CD = 30"—so those are lengths. Then m∠CZ = 40, which would be an arc measure. So the question is asking for m∠CD, which is likely the arc measure of CD. Wait, but CD is already given as 30? Wait, no—the original question says "Find m∠CD." Wait, wait, the original question says: "In ⊙X, AB = 30, CD = 30, and m∠CZ = 40. Find m∠CD."

Wait, hold on. Maybe there's confusion here. Let me check again.

Original question: "In ⊙X, AB = 30, CD = 30, and m∠CZ = 40. Find m∠CD."

Wait, m∠CZ is the measure of arc CZ? Because angle symbols can sometimes denote angles or arcs. Wait, but the problem uses m∠CZ, which usually denotes the measure of angle CZ. But in the given predicates, there's a RightAngle(Angle(C,N,Z)), which suggests that angle CNZ is a right angle. So maybe m∠CZ refers to the measure of angle at point Z? Or is it arc measure?

Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo and meant arc CZ. Since in circle geometry, arc measures are often denoted with m followed by the arc name. For example, m(arc CZ) = 40. That seems more plausible because otherwise, if it were an angle, then we'd need more info about where the vertex is. For instance, angle CZ could be at point C, Z, or another point. But given that there's a RightAngle(Angle(C,N,Z)), which is angle at N between points C, N, Z. So maybe m∠CZ refers to an angle at point Z between points C and something else? Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: It says "m∠CZ = 40". In standard notation, m∠CZ would mean the measure of angle at point Z between points C and another point. But since only two points are mentioned, maybe it's a typo and should be angle at Z between C and another point, like maybe angle CZM or something. Alternatively, maybe the problem meant arc CZ, which is written as m(arc CZ). Given that the other arc-related info includes m∠CZ, perhaps there's a mix-up in notation.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to arc measures. Let's assume that "m∠CZ" actually refers to the measure of arc CZ. That would make sense because arc measures are common in circle problems. So, assuming that, then given arc CZ is 40°, and need to find arc CD. Also, AB and CD are chords of length 30 each. So maybe we can use properties of circles involving chords and arcs.

So first, let's note that in a circle, equal chords correspond to equal arcs. So if AB and CD are chords of equal length, then their subtended arcs should be equal. Therefore, if AB = CD = 30, then arc AB equals arc CD. But the problem gives us arc CZ = 40°, and asks for arc CD. So how does arc CZ relate to arc CD?

Let me try to reconstruct the diagram. Points A, B, C, D, Y, Z, M, N are on circle X. Let's see the lines:

- Line(A,B): connects A and B.
- Line(A,Y): connects A and Y.
- Line(M,N): connects M and N.
- Line(N,Z): connects N and Z.
- Line(Y,M): connects Y and M.
- Line(D,Z): connects D and Z.
- Line(C,Z): connects C and Z.

Also, there are right angles at Angle(Y,M,A) and Angle(C,N,Z). So, ∠YMA is a right angle, meaning that at point M, the lines Y-M-A form a right angle. Similarly, ∠CNZ is a right angle at point N.

Additionally, points A, B, C, D, Y, Z are on the circle. Let me try to sketch mentally:

Since A, Y, M are connected via lines A-Y and Y-M, and there's a right angle at M between Y and A. So triangle YMA is a right triangle with right angle at M. Similarly, at point N, angle CNZ is a right angle, so triangle CNZ is a right triangle with right angle at N.

Now, considering that points M and N are on the circle as well, since Point(M) and Point(N) are part of the circle? Wait, the given predicates say:

PointLiesOnCircle(A, Circle(X)) — so A, B, C, D, Y, Z are on the circle. What about M and N? Are they on the circle? The predicates don't explicitly state that. Wait, checking the initial given predicates:

Looking back, the user listed:

Point(A)
Point(B)
Point(C)
Point(D)
Point(M)
Point(N)
Point(Y)
Point(Z)

Then the lines:

Line(A,B)
Line(A,Y)
Line(M,N)
Line(N,Z)
Line(Y,M)
Line(D,Z)
Line(C,Z)

And the right angles:

RightAngle(Angle(Y,M,A))
RightAngle(Angle(C,N,Z))

Then the PointLiesOnCircle predicates:

PointLiesOnCircle(A, Circle(X))
PointLiesOnCircle(B, Circle(X))
PointLiesOnCircle(C, Circle(X))
PointLiesOnCircle(D, Circle(X))
PointLiesOnCircle(Y, Circle(X))
PointLiesOnCircle(Z, Circle(X))

So points A, B, C, D, Y, Z are on the circle. Points M and N are not necessarily on the circle unless stated. Wait, but in the Line(M,N), they're connected, but unless specified, M and N may be inside or outside the circle. However, since there are right angles at M and N, perhaps those points are on the circle? Wait, no. For example, the right angle at M: angle YMA is a right angle. If M were on the circle, then that would imply that triangle YMA is inscribed in the circle with right angle at M, which would mean that the hypotenuse YA is the diameter. Because in a circle, an inscribed right angle means the hypotenuse is the diameter. But if M is not on the circle, then that doesn't hold.

But since the problem didn't specify that M and N are on the circle, but the rest of the points are. So maybe M and N are inside the circle? Let me think.

Given that, the right angle at M implies that triangle YMA is a right triangle with right angle at M. If M is inside the circle, then YA would be a chord passing through M. Similarly, for point N with the right angle at N in triangle CNZ.

Now, moving back to the main problem. We need to find the measure of arc CD, given that AB = 30 (chord length), CD = 30 (another chord length), and arc CZ = 40 degrees.

Assuming that AB and CD are chords of equal length, so their subtended arcs are equal. Therefore, arc AB equals arc CD. But we need to find arc CD. However, we are told that arc CZ is 40 degrees. How does arc CZ relate to arc CD?

Perhaps there's a relationship between arcs CZ and CD through other elements of the diagram. Let me consider the points involved.

Point Z is connected to C and D. Line(C,Z) and Line(D,Z). So Z is connected to both C and D. Also, Z is on the circle. So points C, Z, D are on the circle. So arc CD is part of the circle, and arc CZ is part of the circle. So arc CZ + arc ZD = arc CD? Wait, but arc CD could be the sum of arc CZ and arc ZD, depending on the position of Z relative to C and D.

But we know that arc CZ is 40 degrees. So if we can find arc ZD, then adding them would give arc CD. But how?

Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Since AB and CD are chords of equal length, their arcs are equal. So arc AB = arc CD. If we can find arc AB, then arc CD would be equal to that. But how do we find arc AB?

Wait, but we aren't given anything directly about arc AB. Unless there's a relation through other arcs.

Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between arc CZ and arc AB due to the right angles at M and N.

Let me think about the right angles. At point M, angle YMA is a right angle. Since Y and A are on the circle, and M is somewhere such that triangle YMA is right-angled at M. As per Thales' theorem, if a triangle is inscribed in a circle and one of its angles is a right angle, then the hypotenuse is the diameter. Therefore, if triangle YMA is right-angled at M, then YA must be the diameter of the circle. Hence, YA is the diameter.

Similarly, at point N, angle CNZ is a right angle. So triangle CNZ is right-angled at N, implying that CZ is the diameter. Wait, because if triangle CNZ is right-angled at N, then the hypotenuse CZ would be the diameter. Therefore, CZ is the diameter of the circle.

Therefore, from the right angles at M and N, we get that YA and CZ are diameters of the circle.

So, YA is a diameter, and CZ is a diameter. Thus, the length of YA and CZ are both twice the radius of the circle.

Moreover, since AB is a chord of length 30, and YA is a diameter, perhaps we can find the radius from that.

Let me formalize this:

Let’s denote the radius of circle X as r. Then, the diameter is 2r.

Since YA is a diameter, its length is 2r. Now, AB is a chord of the circle. Let's recall that the length of a chord is related to the central angle subtending it by the formula:

Chord length = 2r sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle in radians. Or in degrees, Chord length = 2r sin(θ/2).

But since we are dealing with arcs, maybe we can relate chord length to arc measure.

Alternatively, since YA is the diameter, and AB is a chord. If we can find the angle subtended by AB at the center, then we can relate it to the arc AB.

But how?

Alternatively, since YA is a diameter, and A is one endpoint of the diameter. Let me imagine the circle with diameter YA. So points Y and A are endpoints of a diameter. Point B is another point on the circle. So AB is a chord from A to B. The length of AB is given as 30.

If we can find the angle between AB and the diameter YA, or find the central angle corresponding to AB, then we can compute the arc AB.

But without knowing the exact position of B, this seems challenging. However, since AB is a chord of length 30, and YA is the diameter (length 2r), maybe we can find relations between AB and the radius.

Alternatively, since AB is a chord, and YA is a diameter, perhaps triangle YAB is related. Wait, but Y is one end of the diameter, A is the other end. So Y and A are endpoints of the diameter. Then, point B is another point on the circle. So the triangle YAB would have sides YA (diameter), AB (given length 30), and BY. 

Using the Law of Cosines on triangle YAB, we have:

YA² = AB² + BY² - 2 * AB * BY * cos(angle at B)

Wait, but that seems too vague. Alternatively, since YA is the diameter, and B lies on the circle, then angle YBA is a right angle? No, that would be true if the triangle is inscribed with the hypotenuse being the diameter. Wait, if B is on the circle, then angle YBA would be a right angle if YA is the diameter. Wait, no, that's if the angle is at B. Wait, according to Thales' theorem, if you have a triangle inscribed in a circle where one side is the diameter, then the angle opposite that side is a right angle. So, if we have triangle YBA with YA as the diameter, then angle at B would be a right angle. So angle YBA is 90 degrees.

So, triangle YBA is a right-angled triangle at B. Therefore, by Pythagoras:

YA² = AB² + BY²

We know that YA is the diameter, which is 2r. AB is 30. So,

(2r)² = 30² + BY² → 4r² = 900 + BY².

But we don't know BY. However, maybe we can find another equation. Alternatively, since we have another diameter CZ, which is also 2r. And since CD is a chord of length 30, same as AB. So similar logic applies for CD.

For chord CD, since CZ is the diameter, then similarly, triangle CZD would be a right-angled triangle at Z. Therefore, CD² + DZ² = CZ². Since CZ is the diameter, 2r, so:

CD² + DZ² = (2r)^2 → 30² + DZ² = 4r² → same as before.

But this gives us two equations:

From AB: 4r² = 900 + BY²

From CD: 4r² = 900 + DZ²

Thus, BY² = DZ² → BY = DZ.

Hmm, interesting. So the lengths BY and DZ are equal. But how does this help us?

Alternatively, maybe we can find the measure of arc AB. Since AB is a chord of length 30, and the diameter is 2r, we can relate the chord length to the central angle.

The formula for chord length is 2r sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle. So:

AB = 2r sin(θ_AB / 2) → 30 = 2r sin(θ_AB / 2)

Similarly, for CD:

CD = 2r sin(θ_CD / 2) → 30 = 2r sin(θ_CD / 2)

Since AB and CD are equal chords, their central angles are equal. Therefore, θ_AB = θ_CD. Which implies arc AB equals arc CD. But the question is asking for arc CD, so if we can find θ_AB, then that would be the measure of arc CD.

But how do we find θ_AB?

Well, we also know that arc CZ is 40 degrees. Let me think about the location of point Z. Since CZ is a diameter, then Z is the antipodal point of C. Wait, because if CZ is the diameter, then Z is directly opposite C on the circle. Therefore, the arc from C to Z along the circle is half the circumference, i.e., 180 degrees. Wait, but the problem states that m∠CZ = 40 degrees. Wait, earlier confusion arises again. Assuming that m∠CZ is arc CZ, then arc CZ would be 40 degrees. But if CZ is a diameter, then the arc from C to Z should be 180 degrees, which contradicts. This suggests that my assumption that CZ is a diameter might be wrong.

Wait, let's backtrack. Earlier, I thought that because there's a right angle at N in triangle CNZ, then CZ is the diameter. But that's only if the right angle is at N, making CZ the hypotenuse. So triangle CNZ is right-angled at N, so the hypotenuse would be CZ. Therefore, CZ is the diameter. So arc CZ would be 180 degrees. However, the problem states that m∠CZ = 40 degrees, which conflicts with that. So there must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Ah! Here's the error. The right angle is at N, not at Z. The right angle is at N, so triangle CNZ has a right angle at N. Therefore, the hypotenuse is CZ, so CZ is the diameter. Therefore, arc CZ should be 180 degrees, but the problem says m∠CZ = 40 degrees. This contradiction suggests that my previous conclusion is incorrect.

Wait, this indicates that either my understanding of the problem is wrong, or there's a misinterpretation of the angle notation. Let me re-examine the given predicates.

The given RightAngle(Angle(C,N,Z)). So the angle is at point N, between points C, N, Z. So angle CNZ is a right angle. Therefore, triangle CNZ is right-angled at N, so the hypotenuse is CZ, making CZ the diameter. Therefore, the arc from C to Z should be 180 degrees. However, the problem states that m∠CZ = 40 degrees. This inconsistency suggests that perhaps the problem isn't referring to arc measure but to angle measure. 

Wait, if m∠CZ is the measure of angle at point Z, then that would make sense. For example, if there's an angle at Z between points C and another point. Let's consider that. Suppose m∠CZ is the measure of angle at Z formed by points C and another point. For example, angle CZD or angle CZA. But without more context, it's hard to tell. However, given that there's a line from D to Z and from C to Z, maybe angle at Z between C and D? So angle CZD?

But the problem states "m∠CZ = 40". If that's angle at Z between C and D, then it would be angle CZD. So, angle at Z between C and D. That would be an inscribed angle or something else. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and should be angle at C between Z and something else. But given the ambiguity, perhaps I need to reinterpret the problem.

Let me try to focus on the arc CZ = 40 degrees. Assuming that arc CZ is 40 degrees, despite the earlier conflict with the diameter. Perhaps the right angle at N implies that CZ is not the diameter. Wait, but in a right triangle inscribed in a circle, the hypotenuse is the diameter. So if triangle CNZ is right-angled at N, then CZ must be the diameter. Therefore, arc CZ should be 180 degrees. But the problem says it's 40 degrees. Contradiction. So there must be a misunderstanding.

Alternative possibility: The right angle is not at N but elsewhere. Wait, the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(C,N,Z)), which is angle at N between C-N-Z. So yes, right angle at N. Therefore, CZ is the diameter. So arc CZ is 180 degrees. But the problem says arc CZ is 40 degrees. This inconsistency suggests that there's a different interpretation.

Wait, maybe the arc CZ is not the entire diameter but a minor arc. Wait, but in that case, if CZ is a diameter, then the arc would be 180 degrees, regardless of direction. So unless the problem is referring to a different arc, like the minor arc or major arc. But even then, if CZ is a diameter, the minor arc would be 180 degrees. So this still doesn't align with the given 40 degrees.

This suggests that my assumption that CZ is the diameter is incorrect. Where did I go wrong?

Let me re-examine the right angle condition. If triangle CNZ is right-angled at N, then the hypotenuse is CZ, so CZ is the diameter. But if arc CZ is 40 degrees, then the central angle over arc CZ would be 40 degrees. But if CZ is a diameter, the central angle would be 180 degrees. So this is conflicting.

Unless... wait, maybe the triangle isn't inscribed in the circle? But points C, N, Z—wait, point N is not on the circle, right? Because earlier, the PointLiesOnCircle predicates only include A, B, C, D, Y, Z. Points M and N are not specified to be on the circle. So if N is not on the circle, then triangle CNZ is not inscribed in the circle, so Thales' theorem doesn't apply. Ah! That's the key!

Earlier, I assumed that N was on the circle, but the given predicates only state that A, B, C, D, Y, Z are on the circle. Points M and N are not necessarily on the circle. So, the right angle at N in triangle CNZ does not imply that CZ is the diameter. Instead, since N is not on the circle, triangle CNZ is just a right triangle with right angle at N, but not necessarily having CZ as a diameter. Therefore, my previous conclusion was incorrect.

That changes things. So, triangle CNZ is right-angled at N, but since N is not on the circle, we cannot conclude that CZ is the diameter. So, this opens up new possibilities.

Now, returning to the problem: we need to find arc CD, given that AB = 30, CD = 30, and arc CZ = 40 degrees.

Let me try to think differently. Since AB and CD are chords of equal length, their subtended arcs are equal. So arc AB = arc CD. Therefore, if we can find arc AB, that would be the measure of arc CD. But how to find arc AB?

Alternatively, since we know arc CZ = 40 degrees, and points C, Z are on the circle, maybe there's a relationship between arc CZ and arc CD through other elements of the diagram.

Let me look at the connections involving Z. Z is connected to C and D via lines CZ and DZ. So, points C, Z, D are on the circle. So, arc CD passes through Z? Or is Z a point on arc CD? Or is Z located somewhere else?

If Z is on the circle, and there's a line from C to Z and from D to Z, then Z is a point on the circle such that it's connected to both C and D. So, Z could be a point on arc CD or somewhere else. But since arc CZ is given as 40 degrees, that suggests that Z is a point on the circle such that the arc from C to Z is 40 degrees. Therefore, arc CZ = 40 degrees, and we need to find arc CD.

Assuming that, then arc CD could be composed of arc CZ plus arc ZD, or arc CD could be arc CZ minus arc ZD, depending on the position of Z. But without knowing where Z is, it's hard to say. But since Z is connected to D, maybe Z is a point such that D is on the arc from C to Z? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between arc CZ and arc CD through the right angle at N. Let me think about the other parts of the diagram.

There's also a right angle at M in triangle YMA. Let me consider that. Since Y and A are on the circle, and M is a point such that angle YMA is a right angle. If M is inside the circle, then triangle YMA is a right triangle, but not necessarily inscribed. However, since Y and A are on the circle, and M is inside, then YA is a chord, and M is the foot of some perpendicular?

Not sure yet. Maybe this isn't directly helpful. Let's focus on the arc CZ = 40 degrees and trying to find arc CD.

Since arc CZ = 40 degrees, and CD is a chord of length 30, which is equal to AB. If we can relate arc CD to arc CZ, perhaps through some properties.

Alternatively, since both AB and CD are chords of length 30, and arc CZ is 40 degrees, maybe there's a connection between arc CZ and arc CD via other arcs or angles.

Another idea: since Z is connected to C and D, and we know arc CZ = 40 degrees, maybe we can find arc ZD and thus arc CD.

But how? To find arc ZD, we need more information. Let's think about the other lines. Line DZ is present, and line CZ is present. So, Z is connected to both C and D, forming triangle CDZ. Since C and D are on the circle, and Z is also on the circle (as per PointLiesOnCircle(Z, Circle(X))), then triangle CDZ is inscribed in the circle. Therefore, angle at Z is an inscribed angle.

Wait, but if Z is on the circle, then angle at Z would subtend arc CD. The measure of angle at Z would be half the measure of arc CD. Wait, no. Inscribed angle subtends the arc opposite to it. So, if we have triangle CDZ with Z on the circle, then angle at Z subtends arc CD. So, m∠CZD = ½ * measure of arc CD.

But we don't know the measure of angle at Z. However, maybe we can find it using other information.

Wait, the line from Z to D is present. Also, there's a right angle at N in triangle CNZ. Let me think about triangle CNZ. Since N is not on the circle (assuming), and Z is on the circle, and C is on the circle, then triangle CNZ has a right angle at N. So, applying the Pythagorean theorem on triangle CNZ: CN² + NZ² = CZ². But without knowing the lengths of CN or NZ, this might not help directly.

Alternatively, since Z is on the circle, and we know arc CZ = 40 degrees, maybe we can find some relation. For example, the central angle subtending arc CZ is 40 degrees, so the central angle ∠COZ (where O is the center) is 40 degrees. Then, if we can find other angles or lengths related to this.

But we don't know the radius. However, since AB and CD are chords of length 30, and arc AB = arc CD (since equal chords), maybe we can relate the chord lengths to the arcs.

Let me recall that the length of a chord is 2r sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle. So for chord AB and CD:

Length AB = 2r sin(θ_AB / 2) = 30

Length CD = 2r sin(θ_CD / 2) = 30

Since AB = CD, θ_AB = θ_CD, so arc AB = arc CD. Therefore, if we can find arc AB, that would be our answer.

But how to find arc AB?

Maybe through other information. Let's think about the right angle at M. Since angle YMA is a right angle, and Y and A are on the circle, with M being a point inside the circle (since it's connected to Y and A via a line, and forms a right angle). This setup implies that MA is perpendicular to MY. So, triangle YMA is right-angled at M.

If we can relate this to the circle, perhaps using power of a point or something else. The Power of a Point theorem states that for a point M inside the circle, the product of the segments of any two chords passing through M is equal. So, for chords YA and possibly others passing through M.

But we only have one chord passing through M: YA. Other chords passing through M would need to be identified. For example, if there's another chord through M, like MB, but we don't have info about that.

Alternatively, since angle at M is 90 degrees, maybe there's a relationship between the distances from M to Y and M to A. In a right triangle, the altitude to the hypotenuse relates to the segments. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since YA is a chord passing through M, and M is the right-angle vertex, perhaps we can use the fact that in a circle, the distance from the center to the chord relates to the length of the chord.

But without knowing the radius or other information, this might not help directly.

Back to the arc CZ = 40 degrees. Since Z is on the circle, and arc CZ is 40 degrees, then the central angle for arc CZ is 40 degrees. Let's call the center of the circle O. Then, ∠COZ = 40 degrees. If we can relate this to other arcs or angles.

Also, since CD is a chord of length 30, and arc CD = θ_CD, then 30 = 2r sin(θ_CD / 2). Similarly for AB.

But we need to connect this to arc CZ = 40 degrees. Is there a way to relate θ_CD to θ_CZ?

Maybe through triangle CDZ. Since Z is on the circle, and we know arc CZ = 40 degrees, then arc ZD would depend on where D is. If we can find arc ZD, then arc CD = arc CZ + arc ZD or arc CD = |arc CZ - arc ZD| depending on the position of Z.

But how to find arc ZD? Maybe using the right angle at N in triangle CNZ.

Let me consider triangle CNZ, right-angled at N. Since N is not on the circle, but C and Z are on the circle. Let's denote the center of the circle as O. Then, OC and OZ are radii. Let's suppose that N is somewhere inside the circle, forming a right triangle with C and Z.

But without knowing the exact position of N, it's difficult to proceed. However, maybe there's a property or theorem that relates this configuration.

Alternatively, since Z is on the circle, and we have arc CZ = 40 degrees, and we need to find arc CD, perhaps there's a relationship between arc CZ and arc CD through some symmetry or other chords.

Another angle to consider: since both AB and CD are chords of length 30, and arc CZ = 40 degrees, maybe there's a relationship between arc CZ and arc AB, leading to arc CD being determined.

Wait, if we assume that arc CD is equal to arc AB, and if we can find arc AB through some other means, then we can find arc CD.

But how to find arc AB?

Maybe through the right angle at M. Since triangle YMA is right-angled at M, and YA is a chord. Let's assume that the length of YA is the diameter, but earlier that led to contradictions. Wait, but if M is inside the circle, then YA is a chord, and M is a point inside the circle such that angle YMA is 90 degrees. 

Let me consider coordinates. Let's place the circle at the origin for simplicity. Let me assign coordinates to simplify calculations.

Let me assume the circle has center at (0, 0) and radius r. Let me choose coordinates for points Y and A such that YA is a horizontal line, with M at the midpoint, but since angle at M is 90 degrees, this might not hold. Alternatively, set up coordinate system such that Y is at (-r, 0) and A is at (r, 0), making YA the diameter. Then, point M is somewhere such that angle YMA is 90 degrees. For example, if M is at (0, y), then vectors MY and MA would be perpendicular. Let's calculate.

Vector MY = Y - M = (-r - 0, 0 - y) = (-r, -y)

Vector MA = A - M = (r - 0, 0 - y) = (r, -y)

Their dot product should be zero for perpendicularity:

(-r)(r) + (-y)(-y) = -r² + y² = 0 → y² = r² → y = ±r.

So, point M would be at (0, r) or (0, -r). But since M is a point inside the circle, and the circle has radius r, (0, r) is on the circle, but the problem didn't specify that M is inside. Wait, but if M is on the circle, then the triangle YMA would have M on the circle, making YA the diameter, and angle at M being 90 degrees. This would satisfy Thales' theorem. So, this suggests that M is on the circle, making YA the diameter. But earlier, the problem didn't state that M is on the circle. However, given that the predicate for PointLiesOnCircle only includes A, B, C, D, Y, Z, but not M or N. So, this suggests that my assumption that M is on the circle might be incorrect.

But according to this calculation, if M is at (0, r), it's on the circle. So, maybe M is on the circle. This would mean that the right angle at M is on the circle, making YA the diameter. So, this would mean that M is on the circle, and hence, PointLiesOnCircle(M, Circle(X))? But the initial predicates don't mention M being on the circle. This is conflicting.

However, given that the problem provides Line(M,N), and RightAngle(Angle(Y,M,A)), it's possible that M is on the circle, even though it wasn't explicitly stated. This might be an oversight in the problem's predicates, or perhaps it's implied through the right angle condition.

If we accept that M is on the circle, then YA is the diameter, and M is another point on the circle. So, points Y, A, and M are on the circle, with M such that angle YMA is 90 degrees. This fits with Thales' theorem, confirming that YA is the diameter. So, in this scenario, M is on the circle.

Similarly, for the right angle at N in triangle CNZ, if N is on the circle, then CZ would be the diameter. But earlier, this led to a contradiction with arc CZ = 40 degrees. However, if N is not on the circle, then CZ is not the diameter.

But given that the problem includes Point(N) in the list but doesn't specify it's on the circle, we can't assume N is on the circle.

This is getting quite tangled. Let me try to focus on the arc CZ = 40 degrees. Since Z is on the circle, and arc CZ = 40 degrees, then the central angle for arc CZ is 40 degrees. Let me denote the center of the circle as O. Then, ∠COZ = 40 degrees.

Now, since CD is a chord of length 30, and arc CD = θ_CD, then 30 = 2r sin(θ_CD / 2). Also, for arc CZ = 40 degrees, the chord length CZ = 2r sin(40° / 2) = 2r sin(20°).

But we don't know the length of CZ. However, maybe there's a relationship between CZ and other chords.

Alternatively, since Z is connected to D, and we have line DZ, which is a chord from D to Z. So, triangle CDZ has sides CD = 30, CZ = ?, and DZ = ?. But without more information, this is not helpful.

Wait, but if we consider the central angles. For example, the central angle for arc CZ is 40 degrees, and the central angle for arc CD is θ_CD. If we can relate these angles through other arcs or points.

Alternatively, since Z is on the circle, and we have points C, Z, D on the circle, then the arc from C to Z is 40 degrees, and the arc from Z to D is something. If we can find the arc from Z to D, then arc CD = arc CZ + arc ZD or arc CD = |arc CZ - arc ZD|, depending on the position.

But how to find arc ZD?

Maybe through the other right angle at N. Let me think about triangle CNZ, right-angled at N. Since N is not on the circle, but C and Z are on the circle. Let me consider drawing a line from N to the center O, but without knowing where N is, this is difficult.

Alternatively, since we know arc CZ = 40 degrees, and if we can find the measure of arc CD, perhaps through some other relationship.

Wait, if I consider that both AB and CD are chords of equal length 30, then their arcs are equal. So, arc AB = arc CD. If I can find arc AB, then that's the answer. To find arc AB, I need to relate it to other known quantities.

Let me recall that YA is a diameter (from the right angle at M). So, YA = 2r. AB is a chord of length 30. Using the formula for chord length:

AB = 2r sin(θ_AB / 2) = 30

Where θ_AB is the central angle subtending arc AB. So, 30 = 2r sin(θ_AB / 2) → sin(θ_AB / 2) = 15/r.

Similarly, for arc CD, since it's equal to arc AB, we have the same value for θ_CD.

But how to find r?

Maybe through the arc CZ = 40 degrees. The length of chord CZ is 2r sin(40° / 2) = 2r sin(20°). But we don't know the length of CZ. However, maybe CZ is related to other chords.

Wait, CZ is a chord from C to Z, which is on the circle. If we can express CZ in terms of r, and relate it to other chords.

But without additional information about CZ's length, this might not help. However, maybe there's a relationship between CZ and other chords through the right angle at N.

In triangle CNZ, which is right-angled at N, we have:

CN² + NZ² = CZ²

But CN and NZ are not necessarily chords. Since N is not on the circle, CN and NZ are just line segments from N to C and N to Z.

Without knowing where N is, it's impossible to determine their lengths. This seems like a dead end.

Let me try a different approach. Assume that arc CD is the desired measure, and since AB and CD are equal chords, their arcs are equal. So, arc CD = arc AB. If I can find arc AB, that would give the answer.

To find arc AB, I need to relate it to other known quantities. Let's consider the diameter YA. Since YA is a diameter, its length is 2r. If we can find r, then we can use the chord length formula.

But how to find r? Maybe through the arc CZ = 40 degrees. Let's assume that arc CZ is 40 degrees, so the central angle for arc CZ is 40 degrees. The length of chord CZ is 2r sin(40° / 2) = 2r sin(20°). But we don't know the length of CZ. However, if we can relate CZ to other chords.

Wait, if we consider triangle CZD, which has CD = 30 and CZ = 2r sin(20°). But we don't know DZ. Without more information, this is not helpful.

Alternatively, since Z is connected to D, and D is on the circle, maybe there's a relationship between arc CZ and arc CD through some symmetry or other arcs.

Wait, if arc CZ is 40 degrees, and we need to find arc CD, which is equal to arc AB, perhaps there's a way to express arc CD in terms of arc CZ.

But without more information, this is speculative. Let me consider that arc CD is made up of arc CZ plus arc ZD. If I can find arc ZD, then arc CD = 40 + arc ZD.

But how to find arc ZD?

Maybe through the right angle at N. Let's assume that point N is somewhere such that triangle CNZ is right-angled at N, and Z is on the circle. If I can relate arc ZD to other arcs.

Alternatively, since Z is on the circle, and we have arc CZ = 40 degrees, maybe there's a way to find arc ZD using the right angle at N.

But without knowing the exact position of N, this is challenging. Perhaps there's a missing piece of information or a property I'm missing.

Let me think about the total circumference. The circle has 360 degrees. If arc CZ is 40 degrees, and if we can find other arcs, maybe we can deduce arc CD.

But without knowing other arcs, this is not possible.

Wait, but if arc CD is equal to arc AB, and if we can find arc AB through the diameter YA and the chord AB.

Let me try to find r. From the chord AB = 30, and YA = 2r. If I can find the relationship between YA and AB.

Since YA is the diameter, and AB is a chord, we can use the formula for the distance from the center to the chord.

The distance from the center O to the chord AB is d = sqrt(r² - (AB/2)^2).

But since YA is the diameter, and A is one end of the diameter, the distance from O to A is r. But how does this relate to AB?

Wait, let me consider triangle OAB, where O is the center. OA and OB are radii, and AB is a chord. The distance from O to AB is d, and AB = 2√(r² - d²).

But we also know that YA is the diameter, so Y and A are endpoints of the diameter. Let me consider the position of Y relative to the chord AB.

This is getting too abstract without a diagram. Perhaps I should make assumptions to simplify.

Let me assume that arc AB is x degrees, so arc CD is also x degrees. We need to find x.

We know arc CZ is 40 degrees. If I can relate x to 40 degrees.

Suppose that arc CD is x, and arc CZ is 40 degrees. If Z is positioned such that it's on arc CD, then arc CZ + arc ZD = arc CD = x. But we don't know arc ZD.

Alternatively, if Z is on the opposite side, then arc CZ could be part of the circle, and arc CD could be x = arc CZ + arc ZD or x = arc CZ - arc ZD.

But without knowing where Z is, this is uncertain.

Another approach: since both AB and CD are chords of length 30, and arc CZ is 40 degrees, perhaps there's a relationship between the arcs through the right angles at M and N.

But I'm stuck. Let me try to think about the answer choices. The options are 30, 40, 60, 80. Given that arc CZ is 40, and CD is asked, and AB = CD, maybe arc CD is 80 degrees? Or 60? Or 40?

Wait, if arc CZ is 40 degrees, and if Z is a point such that CD is double that, like 80 degrees? Or maybe it's supplementary?

Alternatively, since CZ is 40 degrees, and if CD is a chord that makes an inscribed angle with respect to CZ, but this is too vague.

Wait, let's consider that in the circle, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. If there's an angle subtended by arc CD at point Z, then that angle would be half of arc CD. But we don't know that angle.

But if there's a right angle at N in triangle CNZ, maybe that angle relates to arc CZ or CD.

In triangle CNZ, right-angled at N, the angle at N is 90 degrees. The other angles at C and Z would be complementary. Let's say angle at C is α and angle at Z is β, so α + β = 90 degrees.

These angles are related to the arcs they subtend. For example, angle at C in triangle CNZ would subtend arc NZ, and angle at Z would subtend arc CN. But since N is not on the circle, these arcs are not defined. This doesn't help.

I'm running out of ideas. Let me try to assume that arc CD is 80 degrees, which is double of 40. Why? Because sometimes in geometry, certain configurations lead to doubling. For example, if arc CZ is 40, and CD is twice that, but why?
