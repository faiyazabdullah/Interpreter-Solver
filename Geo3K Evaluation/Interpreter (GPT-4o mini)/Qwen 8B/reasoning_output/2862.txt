Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have four angle measures given in terms of x. The question is asking for the measure of angle W. Let me first parse the given predicates.

The angles mentioned are:

1. MeasureOf(Angle(X, W, Z)) = 3x
2. MeasureOf(Angle(W, Z, Y)) = 4x
3. MeasureOf(Angle(Z, Y, X)) = 2x
4. MeasureOf(Angle(Y, X, W)) = x

Hmm, so these angles are probably part of some polygon or maybe a triangle? Wait, but there are four angles here. Let me think about how they're arranged. Each angle is defined by three points, like Angle(X, W, Z) would be the angle at point W between points X and Z. Similarly for others.

Let me try to visualize or sketch this. Suppose we have points X, W, Z, Y connected in some way. Maybe forming a quadrilateral? Or perhaps a star shape? But since there are four angles given, maybe it's a quadrilateral with vertices X, W, Z, Y. Let me check if those angles add up to something familiar.

Wait, in a quadrilateral, the sum of interior angles is 360 degrees. Let's see if adding up these angles gives us 360. Let's compute total:

3x + 4x + 2x + x = 10x. So 10x equals 360 degrees? Then x would be 36 degrees. But wait, the question is asking for m∠W, which is one of these angles. Wait, looking back, the first angle is ∠XWZ, which is at point W. Wait, the measure of Angle(X, W, Z) is 3x. So that's the angle at W between X and Z. Then the other angles: ∠WZY (at Z), ∠ZYX (at Y), and ∠YXW (at X). Wait, but if these are the four angles of a quadrilateral, then yes, their sum should be 360. So 10x=360 → x=36. Then ∠W is 3x = 108 degrees. Which would be option D. But wait, let me make sure that these angles are indeed the four angles of a quadrilateral.

But wait, maybe the figure isn't a simple quadrilateral. Because if the points are connected in order X-W-Z-Y-X, then the angles would be at each vertex. However, the angles given are:

At W: 3x (Angle X, W, Z)
At Z: 4x (Angle W, Z, Y)
At Y: 2x (Angle Z, Y, X)
At X: x (Angle Y, X, W)

So connecting them in order X-W-Z-Y-X, making a quadrilateral. Then the sum of internal angles would be 360. Therefore, 3x+4x+2x+x=10x=360 → x=36. Then the measure of angle W is 3x=108. That would be answer D. But wait, I need to confirm whether the given angles are indeed the internal angles of the quadrilateral. 

Alternatively, could there be another configuration? For example, maybe the points form a pentagon or another shape? But with four angles given, it's more likely a quadrilateral. Also, the angles are labeled in such a way that they seem to be consecutive around the quadrilateral. 

Another thought: sometimes in problems, especially with angles around a point, the sum might be different. But if it's a convex quadrilateral, the sum is definitely 360. So unless the quadrilateral is self-intersecting or concave, but even then, the sum of internal angles is still 360. Wait, no—wait, in a concave quadrilateral, one angle is greater than 180, but the sum is still 360. So regardless of convexity, the sum remains 360. So assuming that the given angles are the four internal angles of a quadrilateral, then 10x=360, leading to x=36, so angle W is 3*36=108. Hence, answer D.

But let me double-check if there's another possibility. What if the angles are not all internal angles? For instance, maybe some are external? Or maybe the points are arranged differently?

Alternatively, maybe the figure is a triangle with some extended lines? Wait, but there are four angles given. Let me consider another scenario. Suppose there's a triangle XYZ, and points W somewhere on the sides? Hmm, but then the angles mentioned involve W, Z, Y, etc. It's getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's a star-shaped figure with intersecting lines, creating several angles. But without a diagram, it's challenging.

However, given the way the angles are named, each angle has three points. For example, Angle(X, W, Z) is the angle at W between X and Z. Similarly, Angle(W, Z, Y) is the angle at Z between W and Y. So if we imagine points X, W, Z, Y connected in sequence, forming a quadrilateral, then the four angles given would correspond to the four internal angles. Thus, summing to 360. So solving 10x=360 gives x=36, so angle W is 3x=108. Hence, answer D.

Alternatively, could there be a case where the angles are parts of different polygons? For example, maybe two triangles? But then again, the sum might differ. Let me think. If the points form a triangle with an extra point inside, but then the angles would be different. However, the presence of four angles suggests a quadrilateral. 

Therefore, I think the safest assumption is that the given angles are the four internal angles of a quadrilateral. So solving for x gives 36, making angle W equal to 108 degrees. Therefore, the answer is D.
