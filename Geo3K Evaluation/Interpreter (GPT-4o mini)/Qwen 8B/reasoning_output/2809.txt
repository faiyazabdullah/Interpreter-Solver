MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question says that the ratio of the measures of the angles of a triangle is 3:2:1. We need to figure out which of the given options isn't an angle measure of that triangle. The options are 30, 45, 60, and 90 degrees. 

First, I remember that the sum of the angles in any triangle is always 180 degrees. Since the ratios are given as 3:2:1, I should start by figuring out what each part of the ratio represents in terms of actual degrees. Let me think... if the total parts are 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 parts, then each part would be 180 divided by 6. Let me calculate that: 180 / 6 equals 30. So each part is 30 degrees. 

Wait, so the angles would be 3 times 30, which is 90 degrees; 2 times 30 is 60 degrees; and 1 time 30 is 30 degrees. That adds up to 90 + 60 + 30 = 180, which checks out. So the three angles are 30°, 60°, and 90°. 

Now looking at the answer choices: A is 30, which is one of them. B is 45, which isn't listed here. Wait, but the angles we found are 30, 60, 90. So 45 isn't among them. But wait, let me check again. The options are A. 30, B. 45, C. 60, D. 90. So the angles in the triangle are 30, 60, 90. Therefore, 45 isn't one of them. So the answer should be B. 

But hold on, maybe there's something I'm missing? Let me verify. Suppose someone thought the ratio was different. For example, if they misread the ratio as 3:2:1 but thought it's 3:1:2 instead. Wait, no, the order doesn't matter because addition is commutative. The sum is still 6 parts. Alternatively, could there be another way to interpret the ratio? Like, maybe the triangle is not a right triangle? But according to the calculation, one of the angles is 90°, making it a right triangle. 

So the angles are definitely 30°, 60°, 90°. Therefore, the answer choices that are not present are 45°, which is option B. Hence, the correct answer is B.
