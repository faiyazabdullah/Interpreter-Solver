MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So we have points A, B, and C forming a triangle. The given predicates mention that there's a right angle at Angle(A,C,B). Wait, that means the angle at point C between points A, C, and B is a right angle. So triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at C. 

Now, the sides: they tell us that the length of AB is x, AC is x-3, and BC is 9. Since it's a right-angled triangle, I should use the Pythagorean theorem here. In a right-angled triangle, the sum of the squares of the legs equals the square of the hypotenuse. But first, I need to confirm which side is the hypotenuse. 

In a triangle, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. Since the right angle is at C, the hypotenuse would be AB. Therefore, AB is the hypotenuse. That means the other two sides, AC and BC, are the legs. 

So according to the Pythagorean theorem: AB² = AC² + BC². Substituting the given expressions: x² = (x - 3)² + 9². Let me write that down properly.

Expanding the equation: x² = (x² - 6x + 9) + 81. Simplify the right-hand side: x² -6x + 9 + 81 = x² -6x + 90. So the equation becomes x² = x² -6x + 90. 

Subtract x² from both sides: 0 = -6x + 90. Then adding 6x to both sides gives 6x = 90. Dividing both sides by 6, x = 15. 

Wait, but let me check if I got the hypotenuse right. Suppose instead that maybe BC was the hypotenuse? No, because the right angle is at C, so the hypotenuse has to be AB. Because the hypotenuse is always opposite the right angle. So yes, AB is the hypotenuse. 

Let me verify my calculation again. Plugging x=15 into the lengths: AB is 15, AC is 15-3=12, BC is 9. Then 15² should equal 12² + 9². Calculating: 225 vs 144 + 81 = 225. Yes, that works. So x=15. Looking at the options, B is 15. So the answer should be B.
