Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, we have some angle measures given in terms of variables x and y, and we need to find the value of x. Let me start by writing down all the given information so I can see it better.

First, the given predicates are:

1. MeasureOf(Angle(C, D, B)) = 5y
2. MeasureOf(Angle(D, B, C)) = 2x
3. MeasureOf(Angle(B, C, D)) = 120 degrees
4. MeasureOf(Angle(C, D, E)) = 108 degrees

Wait, the question is about finding x. But there's also a y involved here. Maybe there's a way to relate these equations? Also, since angles are mentioned, perhaps they form part of a polygon or maybe a triangle?

Let me visualize this. Points C, D, B, E... Hmm. Maybe it's a quadrilateral or some polygon. Let me think about how the points are connected. 

Looking at the angles:

Angle(C, D, B) – that would be the angle at point D between points C and B. Similarly, Angle(D, B, C) is the angle at point B between points D and C. Then Angle(B, C, D) is the angle at point C between points B and D. And Angle(C, D, E) is the angle at D between points C and E. 

So, if I imagine points C, D, B forming some triangle, but there's also a point E connected to D. Maybe there's a pentagon or something else. Alternatively, maybe triangle CBD with another point E connected?

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle CDB? Wait, let's check the angles around those points.

But first, let me note that the sum of angles around a point is 360 degrees, and in a triangle, the sum is 180. Since there are angles given at different points, maybe we can consider polygons or triangles formed by these points.

Starting with Angle(B, C, D) = 120 degrees. That's the angle at point C between points B and D. So in triangle BCD, angle at C is 120 degrees. Then, looking at other angles:

Angle(C, D, B) is at D, between C and B. So in triangle BCD, angle at D would be 5y. Then angle at B would be Angle(D, B, C), which is 2x. Therefore, in triangle BCD, the three angles are:

At C: 120°, at D: 5y, at B: 2x. Since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, we can write:

120 + 5y + 2x = 180

That simplifies to 5y + 2x = 60. Let me note that equation as Equation (1): 5y + 2x = 60.

Now, there's another angle given: Angle(C, D, E) = 108°, which is the angle at D between points C and E. So that's another angle at D. Now, depending on where point E is located, this could form another triangle or part of a larger shape.

Assuming that points C, D, E form a straight line or part of another triangle. Wait, if we consider angle at D between C and E, then maybe DE is a side extending from D. So, if we look at point D, it has two angles: one from triangle BCD (which was 5y) and another angle involving point E (which is 108°). Unless those angles are adjacent, making the total angle around point D.

Wait, but angles around a point sum up to 360°, unless they are on a straight line. However, if points C, D, E are arranged such that CD and DE form a straight line, then the angle between DC and DE would be 180°, but here the angle at D between C and E is given as 108°, which suggests that DE is not colinear with DC. So, maybe there's another angle at D. Let me think.

In the previous triangle BCD, angle at D was 5y. Now, adding angle CDE = 108°, which is another angle at D. Are these two angles adjacent? For example, if BD and DE are two sides forming angles at D. Wait, but BD connects B to D, and DE connects D to E. So, if we have angle between DC and DB being 5y (from triangle BCD), and angle between DC and DE being 108°, then the angle between DB and DE would be the difference between these two angles?

Wait, perhaps not. Let me draw this mentally. At point D, there are two angles mentioned: one is angle CDB (which is part of triangle BCD, so that's angle between DC and DB, which is 5y). Another angle is angle CDE (between DC and DE), which is 108°. Depending on the position of E relative to B, these angles could be adjacent or separate.

Wait, suppose that point E is connected to D, forming another segment. So, if we consider the angles at D: between DC and DB (angle CDB = 5y), and between DC and DE (angle CDE = 108°). If DE is on the same side as DB, then the total angle around D would involve these two angles. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to tell. However, maybe we can assume that the sum of angles around D relates to these two angles plus others?

Alternatively, maybe triangle CDE is involved? Or maybe quadrilateral BCDE? This is getting complicated. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire figure includes points B, C, D, E, with certain connections. Let me try to reconstruct the structure.

From the angles given:

- In triangle BCD, we have angles at B, C, D: 2x, 120°, 5y respectively.

Then, there's angle CDE = 108°, which is at D. Assuming that DE is connected to D, so maybe E is a new point connected to D. So, perhaps there's a triangle CDE or another triangle involving E.

Alternatively, if we consider that the points form a pentagon, but that might complicate things. Let me focus on the angles given.

We have two equations so far:

Equation (1): 5y + 2x = 60.

Another equation comes from the angle at D. If we can express the angles around D, maybe we can get another equation. Let's consider that.

At point D, there are two angles mentioned:

1. Angle CDB (from triangle BCD) = 5y.
2. Angle CDE = 108°.

If these two angles are adjacent, then the total angle around D would be 5y + 108°. But unless there's more information, like whether DE is on the same line as DB or not. Wait, but if we consider that the angles at D are parts of different structures.

Alternatively, if E lies somewhere such that DE forms another side. Suppose that from point D, there are two segments: DC and DB (as in triangle BCD), and another segment DE. So, the angle between DC and DB is 5y, and between DC and DE is 108°, implying that the angle between DB and DE is 108° - 5y. But this depends on the direction of DE.

However, without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging. Perhaps there's another triangle or quadrilateral involving E?

Wait, maybe considering triangle CDE. If we know angle CDE = 108°, but we don't have enough info about other angles in that triangle. Alternatively, if there's a relationship between triangles BCD and CDE?

Alternatively, maybe considering that the sum of angles in triangle CDE. But without more angles, that might not help directly.

Wait, but maybe there's another equation involving x and y. Let me think again. We have only one equation so far: 5y + 2x = 60. Need another equation to solve for x.

Is there another angle given? The problem mentions four angle measures, but only three are used in the triangle BCD. The fourth is angle CDE = 108°. How does that fit in?

Perhaps considering that the sum of angles around point D equals 360°, assuming that all angles at D are accounted for. Wait, but in typical problems, unless specified otherwise, angles in a plane around a point sum to 360°, but in many cases, especially with triangles, we consider internal angles.

But if we take the angle between DC and DB as 5y, and the angle between DC and DE as 108°, then the remaining angle at D would depend on the direction of DE. For instance, if DE is on the opposite side of DC relative to DB, then the total angle around D would be 5y + 108° + ... ?

Alternatively, maybe DE is connected such that angle between DB and DE is supplementary to angle CDE? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that the entire figure forms a star or another polygon where multiple angles meet. But without a diagram, it's tricky. 

Wait, maybe there's a cyclic quadrilateral involved? For example, if points B, C, D, E lie on a circle. But that's just a guess. 

Alternatively, think about triangle CDE. If we can find another angle in that triangle, but we only know one angle. However, if there's a relation between triangles BCD and CDE via shared sides or angles.

Alternatively, maybe there's a transversal or parallel lines? Not sure.

Wait, another thought: since angle CDE is 108°, and angle at C in triangle BCD is 120°, maybe there's a relationship between those angles? Like if lines CE and CB are related somehow?

Alternatively, maybe the sum of angles in some larger polygon. For example, if points B, C, D, E form a quadrilateral, then the sum of its interior angles would be (4-2)*180=360. But we have angles at C (120°), D (maybe combining 5y and 108?), and others?

Wait, if we consider quadrilateral BCDE. Let's say the vertices are B, C, D, E. Then the sum of interior angles should be 360°. We know angle at C is 120°, angle at D would be the sum of angles from triangle BCD (5y) and angle CDE (108°)? No, because in a quadrilateral, each vertex has one interior angle. So, if angle at D is composed of two angles, that might not fit.

Alternatively, if the quadrilateral is BCDE, then angle at D would be the angle between CD and DE, which is given as 108°, and angle at C would be the angle between BC and CD, which is 120°, but wait, earlier we had angle at C in triangle BCD as 120°, which might be part of the quadrilateral's angle at C.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me try again.

In quadrilateral BCDE, the angles would be:

At B: ?
At C: ?
At D: 108°
At E: ?

But we know angle at C in triangle BCD is 120°, which may be part of the angle at C in the quadrilateral. But unless we know how the sides connect. Without knowing the exact structure, it's difficult to proceed.

Wait, maybe there's another triangle involving E. For example, triangle CDE. In that triangle, we know angle at D is 108°, but we don't know the other angles. If we can relate them to other angles...

Alternatively, maybe triangle BDE? If we can find angles there. But again, not enough info.

Wait, going back to the initial idea. We have one equation: 5y + 2x = 60. If we can find another equation involving x and y, we can solve for x. Where can that come from?

Maybe considering the angles around point D. Let's assume that at point D, the angles around it sum up to 360°, but that requires knowing all the angles at that point. 

Suppose that at point D, there are two angles: the one from triangle BCD (which is angle CDB = 5y) and the angle CDE = 108°, and possibly another angle if there's another line. Wait, but if the figure is made of triangles and lines connected properly, maybe there's another angle?

For example, if there's a line from D to E and another line from D to B, then the angle between DB and DE would be something. But unless we have more information, it's hard to say.

Wait, but maybe the two angles at D (5y and 108°) are supplementary? Or complementary? Or add up to something else?

Alternatively, if DE is a continuation of DB, then angle CDE would be supplementary to angle CDB. For example, if DE is a straight line extending from DB, then angle between DC and DE would be 180° minus angle between DC and DB. But that's speculative.

Let me explore that possibility. Assume that DE is a straight line extension of DB beyond B. Then, angle CDE would be 180° - angle CDB. Wait, if that were the case, then:

Angle CDE = 180° - angle CDB => 108° = 180° - 5y => 5y = 72° => y = 14.4°. Then plugging into Equation (1): 5*(14.4) + 2x = 60 → 72 + 2x = 60 → 2x = -12 → x = -6. Which doesn't make sense, as angles can't be negative. So that assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe angle CDE is part of another triangle. Suppose that E is connected to B, forming triangle BDE or something else. But without more info, it's hard to say.

Wait, maybe there's another triangle involving point E. For example, triangle BDE, where we know angle at D is 108°, but not sure.

Alternatively, think about exterior angles. For example, in triangle BCD, the exterior angle at D would be equal to the sum of the remote interior angles. Wait, the exterior angle at D would be equal to angle B + angle C. Wait, no, the exterior angle is equal to the sum of the non-adjacent interior angles. So, if we extend a side at D, forming an exterior angle. But I'm not sure how that applies here.

Alternatively, maybe considering that the angle at D (in triangle BCD) is 5y, and angle CDE is 108°, and those two angles are supplementary. So 5y + 108 = 180, leading to 5y = 72 → y = 14.4. Again, same as before, leading to negative x. Which isn't possible. Hence, that assumption is invalid.

Hmm. Maybe there's another way. Let me think about the total angles in the figure. If there's a triangle involving E, like triangle CDE, where angle at D is 108°, and if we can find other angles there. But without more data, this seems impossible.

Wait, maybe the key is that angle CDE = 108°, which is a regular polygon angle? Because 108° is the internal angle of a regular pentagon. Wait, yes! Each internal angle of a regular pentagon is 108°. Could this be a clue? Maybe the points form a regular pentagon? But not necessarily, since the other angles are 120°, which doesn't fit a regular pentagon.

Alternatively, maybe it's part of a pentagon with some irregular angles. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think about the fact that 108° and 120° are both angles in different contexts. Let me think of the overall structure. If points B, C, D, E form a quadrilateral with angles at C (120°), D (unknown), and E (unknown), and another angle at B. But still not helpful.

Wait, going back to the original problem. The question asks for x. There are four angle measures given, but only three are in the triangle BCD, and one more at D. Maybe there's a missing piece here.

Wait, maybe there's a relationship between the angles in triangle BCD and the angle at D involving E. For example, if lines BE and CE intersect at some point, creating other angles. But again, too vague.

Wait, another approach: since there are two variables, x and y, and only one equation so far, perhaps there's another relationship from the angle CDE = 108°. Let's consider that angle CDE is part of triangle CDE. If we can find another angle in that triangle, we might relate it to other parts.

But without knowing more about triangle CDE, like sides or other angles, it's hard. Unless there's some property connecting it to triangle BCD.

Alternatively, maybe considering that the sum of all angles around point C? Point C has angle BCD = 120°, and maybe other angles if there are other lines connected to C. For example, if there's a line from C to E, forming angle ECD. But again, without knowing, it's hard.

Wait, maybe considering that the entire figure is a pentagon, with angles at various points. The sum of internal angles of a pentagon is (5-2)*180 = 540°. If we can find expressions for all angles in terms of x and y, we could set up an equation.

But we only know one angle: at C is 120°, and at D is 108°. Other angles would be at B, E, and maybe another. But without knowing how many sides, this is uncertain.

Alternatively, maybe it's a triangle with a point inside? For example, if E is inside triangle BCD, creating smaller triangles. But then, the angles around E would need to sum to 360°, but again, not sure.

This is quite challenging without seeing the actual figure. But since it's a math problem, likely there's a standard configuration.

Wait, let me think again about the triangle BCD. Its angles are 2x at B, 120° at C, and 5y at D. So, 2x + 120 + 5y = 180 → 2x + 5y = 60. That's Equation (1).

Now, considering angle at D, which is 5y, and angle CDE = 108°. If these two angles are adjacent, forming a linear pair or something. For example, if DE is a straight line extending from DC, then angle CDE would be a straight angle, but it's given as 108°, so that's not the case.

Alternatively, if DE is connected such that angle between DB and DE is supplementary to angle CDE? Not sure.

Wait, here's a thought: maybe the lines BD and ED form a straight line, making angle CDE supplementary to angle CDB. So, if BD and ED are on a straight line, then angle between DC and DE would be 180° minus angle CDB. Thus:

108° = 180° - 5y → 5y = 72 → y = 14.4°. Plugging into Equation (1):

2x + 5*(14.4) = 60 → 2x + 72 = 60 → 2x = -12 → x = -6. Still negative, which is impossible. So that's invalid.

Alternative idea: maybe angle CDE is part of another triangle that includes x. For example, if E is connected to B, forming triangle BDE. In that case, if we knew some angles there, we could relate them. But we don't.

Wait, what if the figure is a pentagon with vertices B, C, D, E, and another point? Not sure.

Alternatively, think of the entire figure as having multiple triangles sharing common sides. For example, triangle BCD and triangle CDE share side CD. So, in triangle CDE, we know angle at D is 108°, and if we can find other angles there, maybe relating to other parts.

But without more information, this is stuck. Perhaps there's an error in my assumptions? Let me re-examine the given predicates.

Wait, the problem says "the figure", implying that there is a figure associated with it, which we don't have. But given that this is a standardized problem, maybe there's a standard configuration expected.

Wait, let me think about the possibility that the angles given are part of a triangle or a quadrilateral with specific properties. For example, if points B, C, D, E form a trapezoid or something.

Wait, another idea: maybe the angles at D (5y and 108°) are part of a larger triangle or another polygon. For example, if there's a triangle involving E and B, where angle at D is 108°, and other angles can be expressed in terms of x or y.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that the sum of angles in triangle CDE. Let's say in triangle CDE, we have angle at D = 108°, and if we can express other angles in terms of x or y.

But without knowing more about the triangle, it's hard. However, maybe there's a connection between triangles BCD and CDE. For example, if they share a common side or height.

Wait, another thought: maybe the lines EB and EC form some relationship? For instance, if EB is parallel to DC or something. But again, without info, hard to say.

Alternatively, think about the fact that 108° and 120° are both angles in a star or something. Wait, 108° is the internal angle of a regular pentagon, and 120° is the internal angle of a regular hexagon. But how do these relate?

Alternatively, think about the exterior angles. For example, if there's a polygon where these angles are exterior angles. But not sure.

Wait, going back to the equation 2x + 5y = 60. If I can find another equation involving x and y, I can solve for x. Where could that equation come from?

Maybe considering that the sum of angles around point E or point B? Or some other point?

Alternatively, maybe considering that the sum of all angles in some polygon. For example, if points B, C, D, E form a quadrilateral, then sum of interior angles is 360°. Let's try that.

Assume quadrilateral BCDE. The angles would be:

At B: let's call it angle at B, which is part of triangle BCD, which is 2x. But wait, in a quadrilateral, each vertex has one angle. So, if the quadrilateral is BCDE, then angle at B is the angle between CB and BE, which might not be the same as angle in triangle BCD. So this might not work.

Alternatively, if the quadrilateral is BCED, then angle at B would be something else. Without knowing the structure, it's unclear.

Wait, here's a different idea. Maybe the lines BE and CD intersect at some point, creating vertical angles or something. But again, no info.

Alternatively, think about the triangle CDE and triangle BCD sharing side CD. If there's a relationship between their angles. For example, if they are similar or something. But without knowing more, this is speculation.

Wait, let's try to assume that there's another equation. Maybe the angle at E is related to x or y? For example, if there's a triangle involving E where we can use the Law of Sines or Cosines. But without side lengths, this might not be feasible.

Alternatively, maybe the angle at E is related to the other angles. For example, if the figure is a triangle with E as a point inside, creating several smaller triangles.

But without more information, I'm stuck. Let me go back to what I have. I have one equation: 2x + 5y = 60. I need another equation.

Wait, maybe the angle at D (which is 5y) and the angle CDE (which is 108°) are part of a larger angle. For example, if there's a straight line passing through D, making the sum of these angles equal to 180°. So, 5y + 108 = 180 → 5y = 72 → y = 14.4. Then plug into Equation (1): 2x + 5*14.4 = 60 → 2x = 60 - 72 = -12 → x = -6. Negative angle, impossible. So that's invalid.

Alternatively, if the sum of these two angles is 90°, but 5y + 108 = 90 → 5y = -18, which is even worse.

Alternatively, maybe the angle at D is split into 5y and 108°, making the total angle at D equal to 5y + 108°, and if that angle is part of another triangle. For example, if there's a triangle involving D and some other points.

Wait, if there's a triangle where angle at D is 5y + 108°, and we know other angles in that triangle. But without knowing, it's hard.

Wait, what if there's a triangle involving points B, D, E? Let's say in triangle BDE, we know angle at D is something, and other angles. But we don't know anything about it.

Alternatively, think about the fact that angle CDE = 108°, and angle at C is 120°, and maybe there's a triangle where these two angles are part of the same triangle. For example, triangle CDE and triangle BCE, but again, not sure.

I'm running out of ideas. Maybe I missed something. Let me recheck the given predicates.

Wait, the problem says "the figure" implies that there's a specific configuration, and the answer is among the options A-D. Given that, maybe the answer is one of the choices, and I need to find a way to relate the equations.

Since I have only one equation, maybe there's an implicit assumption that the angles at D (5y and 108°) are supplementary or something else.

Wait, let's suppose that the total angle at D is 5y + 108°, and this is part of a straight line or something. For example, if there's a straight line through D, making the sum of these angles equal to 180°. So:

5y + 108 = 180 → 5y = 72 → y = 14.4. As before, leading to x = -6, which is impossible. So that's not working.

Alternatively, if the total angle at D is 5y + 108° = 360°, which would mean the point D is part of a full rotation, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the angle at D is 5y, and the angle CDE is 108°, and these are two angles in a triangle. For example, if there's a triangle with angles 5y, 108°, and something else. But without knowing the third angle, it's hard.

Wait, here's a new idea: maybe the lines BE and CD intersect at point E, forming vertical angles. But again, not enough info.

Alternatively, think about the exterior angle theorem. In triangle BCD, the exterior angle at D would be equal to the sum of the remote interior angles. The exterior angle at D would be angle CDE = 108°, and the remote interior angles would be angle at B (2x) and angle at C (120°). So according to the exterior angle theorem:

Exterior angle = sum of remote interior angles → 108° = 2x + 120° → 2x = 108° - 120° → 2x = -12° → x = -6°. Again, negative angle. Not possible.

But wait, this assumes that angle CDE is the exterior angle at D for triangle BCD. Is that valid?

Yes! If we extend side BD of triangle BCD to a point E, then the exterior angle at D would be angle CDE. So, in that case, the exterior angle at D is 108°, and it should be equal to the sum of the remote interior angles, which are angle at B (2x) and angle at C (120°). So:

108 = 2x + 120 → 2x = 108 - 120 → 2x = -12 → x = -6. Still negative. But this contradicts the possibility of a negative angle. So this suggests that either the assumption is wrong, or there's a miscalculation.

Wait, but why would the exterior angle at D be 108°? If we extended BD to E, then the exterior angle would be angle between CD and DE, which is given as 108°. So this seems correct. But the resulting x is negative, which is impossible. What's wrong here?

Ah! Maybe I got the remote interior angles wrong. The exterior angle theorem states that the exterior angle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles. In triangle BCD, if we extend BD to E, then the exterior angle at D would be adjacent to the interior angle at D (which is 5y). The remote interior angles would be angle at B (2x) and angle at C (120°). So, the exterior angle (which is angle CDE) should be equal to 2x + 120. But according to this, 108 = 2x + 120 → x = -6. This suggests inconsistency.

But this implies that either the given angle CDE is not the exterior angle, or there's a mistake in the setup.

Wait, but the problem states that angle CDE is 108°, which is the angle at D between C and E. If E is on the extension of BD, then this angle would indeed be the exterior angle. But the calculation leads to a contradiction. So what's the issue?

Possibly, the given angle CDE is not the exterior angle, but instead, it's an interior angle of another triangle. Or perhaps the figure is not a simple triangle, but involves multiple triangles.

Wait, maybe the angle CDE is not an exterior angle, but part of another triangle. Let me think differently. If we consider triangle CDE, with angle at D being 108°, and if there's a relationship between this triangle and triangle BCD.

For example, if CE is parallel to BD, then corresponding angles might be equal. But without knowing, this is speculative.

Alternatively, maybe there's a typo in the problem, or I misread something. Let me double-check the given predicates.

Given:
MeasureOf(Angle(C, D, B)) = 5y → this is angle at D between C and B, which is 5y.
MeasureOf(Angle(D, B, C)) = 2x → this is angle at B between D and C, which is 2x.
MeasureOf(Angle(B, C, D)) = 120° → this is angle at C between B and D, which is 120°.
MeasureOf(Angle(C, D, E)) = 108° → angle at D between C and E, which is 108°.

So, if we consider triangle BCD, with angles at B: 2x, at C: 120°, at D: 5y. Sum is 2x + 120 + 5y = 180 → 2x + 5y = 60.

Also, angle at D (between C and E) is 108°. If this is an exterior angle, it should equal 2x + 120°, but that gives x = -6, which is impossible. Hence, this suggests that angle CDE is not the exterior angle, but another angle.

Wait, what if angle CDE is part of a different triangle, like CDE, where angle at D is 108°, and if we can relate it to other angles. For example, if there's a triangle CDE where angle at D is 108°, and angle at C is something related to the angle at C in triangle BCD.

But angle at C in triangle BCD is 120°, which is the angle between B and D at C. If there's another angle at C from triangle CDE, then the total angle at C would be 120° plus something, but this depends on the figure.

Alternatively, if point E is such that CE is a straight line, making angle at C between B and E equal to 120°, but again, not sure.

This is very frustrating. Given that I'm stuck, maybe I should consider that there's a mistake in my assumption about the exterior angle. Let me try to think differently.

Let me assume that the given angle CDE is not an exterior angle, but rather an interior angle of another triangle. For example, if we have triangle CDE, with angle at D = 108°, and if we can relate this to other angles in the figure.

If I consider that point E is such that line CE is connected, forming another triangle. For example, if we have triangle CDE, and line BE connects to E. But without more info, it's hard.

Wait, what if there's a triangle CDE where angle at D is 108°, and angle at C is related to angle at C in triangle BCD? For example, if line CE is the same as line CB, making angle at C between D and E equal to 120°, but that would mean angle CDE is part of a different triangle.

Alternatively, if lines CE and BD intersect at some point, creating vertical angles. But again, no info.

Wait, let me try to assume that x is one of the answer choices and see if it fits. For example, if x = 36 (option A), then let's see.

From Equation (1): 2x + 5y = 60 → 2*36 + 5y = 60 → 72 + 5y = 60 → 5y = -12 → y = -2.4. Not possible.

Option B: x = 54. Then 2*54 = 108, so 108 + 5y = 60 → 5y = -48 → y = -9.6. Still negative.

Option C: x = 60 → 2*60 = 120 → 120 + 5y = 60 → 5y = -60 → y = -12. No good.

Option D: x = 108 → 2*108 = 216 → 216 + 5y = 60 → 5y = -156 → y = -31.2. Also invalid.

All options give negative y, which suggests that there's a mistake in my approach. But since the problem is solvable, I must have made a wrong assumption.

Let me revisit the exterior angle idea. If the exterior angle at D is 108°, then 108 = 2x + 120 → x = -6. But this is impossible. However, maybe the exterior angle is at a different location?

Wait, maybe the exterior angle is at B? No, the given angle at B is 2x, which is part of triangle BCD.

Alternatively, maybe the given angle CDE is not an exterior angle but an interior angle of a different triangle. For example, if there's a triangle CDE where angle at D is 108°, and angle at E is something, and angle at C is something else. If I can relate angle at C to the angle in triangle BCD.

For example, if line CE is the same as line CB, then angle at C in triangle CDE would be the same as angle at C in triangle BCD, which is 120°. But then, in triangle CDE, we have angles: at D = 108°, at C = 120°, so the third angle at E would be 180 - 108 - 120 = -48°, which is impossible. Hence, invalid.

Alternatively, if angle at C in triangle CDE is supplementary to 120°, like 60°, then angle at E would be 180 - 108 - 60 = 12°. But how would that relate to x?

But this is pure speculation. Without knowing the relations, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, maybe there's a typo in the problem, and the measure of angle CDE is 72° instead of 108°? Or perhaps I misread the angle measures. Let me double-check.

Original given:

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C, D, B)), 5*y) → angle at D, between C and B: 5y.

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D, B, C)), 2*x) → angle at B, between D and C: 2x.

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B, C, D)), 120) → angle at C, between B and D: 120.

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C, D, E)), 108) → angle at D, between C and E: 108.

So, the angle at D is 5y (from triangle BCD) and 108° (from angle CDE). If these are two different angles at D, perhaps part of different triangles.

Wait, maybe the sum of these two angles at D is equal to some other value. For example, if DE is a straight line extending from DC, making the total angle at D equal to 180°, then 5y + 108 = 180 → 5y = 72 → y = 14.4. Then, substituting into Equation (1): 2x + 5*14.4 = 60 → 2x = 60 - 72 = -12 → x = -6. Still negative.

But this suggests that there's an error in the problem or in my understanding. Alternatively, maybe the angle CDE is not at D but at E? No, the predicate says MeasureOf(Angle(C, D, E)), which is angle at D between C and E.

Wait, perhaps the angle at D is split into two parts: 5y and 108°, and the total angle at D is 5y + 108°, and this total is part of a larger angle. For example, if there's a straight line passing through D, making the total angle 180°, so 5y + 108 = 180 → y = 14.4, leading to x = -6. Still negative.

This suggests that there's a fundamental flaw in the problem setup, or I've misunderstood the angle definitions.

Wait, let me try to think outside the box. What if the figure is not a simple polygon, but includes overlapping lines or something? For example, if point E is inside triangle BCD, creating smaller angles. In that case, the angle at D (5y) would be split into 108° and something else. But how?

If point E is inside triangle BCD, then angle CDE would be part of the interior. For example, if DE divides angle at D into two parts: 108° and (5y - 108°). But this would require that 5y > 108°, so y > 21.6. Then, using Equation (1): 2x + 5y = 60. If y > 21.6, then 5y > 108, so 2x = 60 - 5y < 60 - 108 = -48 → x < -24. Still negative.

No good.

Alternatively, if the angle at D is 108°, and the angle CDB is 5y, and these are two angles forming a straight line, then 5y + 108 = 180 → y = 14.4, leading to x = -6. Still negative.

This suggests that the problem as given is inconsistent, or there's a missing piece of information. But since this is a problem from a test, there must be a solution. Let me think once more.

Wait, perhaps the angle at D in triangle BCD is not 5y, but something else. Wait, the predicate says MeasureOf(Angle(C, D, B)) = 5y, which is the angle at D between C and B, so that is indeed the angle at D in triangle BCD, which is 5y. So that's correct.

Maybe the problem uses radians instead of degrees? But the answer choices are numerical, and 108° and 120° are likely in degrees. If they were in radians, the values would be different, but it's unlikely.

Wait, let me try to think of x as a positive value and see if there's a way to adjust the equations. From Equation (1): 2x + 5y = 60. If I can find another equation, maybe from the angle CDE = 108°, which is related to x.

Wait, if there's a triangle where angle is 108°, and it involves x. For example, if there's a triangle with angles 108°, 2x, and something else. But without knowing, it's hard.

Wait, let me think: if I assume that x is 36, which is option A. Then, from Equation (1): 2*36 + 5y = 60 → 72 + 5y = 60 → 5y = -12 → y = -2.4. Not possible.

If x is 54 (option B): 2*54 = 108 → 108 + 5y = 60 → 5y = -48 → y = -9.6. Still negative.

If x is 60 (option C): 2*60 = 120 → 120 + 5y = 60 → 5y = -60 → y = -12.

If x is 108 (option D): 2*108 = 216 → 216 + 5y = 60 → 5y = -156 → y = -31.2.

None of these give positive y. This suggests that there's a mistake in the problem or in my understanding. But since this is a problem meant to have a solution, I must have made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the angle at D in triangle BCD is not 5y, but 5y is the measure of angle at C? No, the predicate says MeasureOf(Angle(C, D, B)) is 5y, which is angle at D between C and B. So that's angle at D.

Wait, what if the angle at D is 5y, and the angle CDE is 108°, and these are two angles in a triangle? For example, if there's a triangle where these two angles are part of it. Let's say, triangle CDE and triangle CDB share some side.

Wait, if I consider triangle CDE, with angle at D = 108°, and if there's a relationship between this triangle and triangle BCD. For example, if CB is parallel to DE, then corresponding angles would be equal. Let's say CB || DE. Then, angle at D (108°) would correspond to angle at B in triangle BCD. But angle at B in triangle BCD is 2x. So, 108 = 2x → x = 54. Option B!

Wait, this could be it! If CB is parallel to DE, then the corresponding angles would be equal. Let me explain:

If CB is parallel to DE, and if there's a transversal line CD, then the corresponding angles would be equal. The angle at D between CD and DE (which is 108°) would correspond to the angle at B between CB and BD. Wait, but the angle at B in triangle BCD is 2x. So, if CB || DE, then angle between CB and BD (at B) would be equal to angle between DE and CD (at D), which is 108°. Hence, 2x = 108 → x = 54. Which is option B.

This makes sense! So, the key assumption is that CB is parallel to DE, allowing us to equate the corresponding angles. This would give x = 54.

Let me verify this. If CB
