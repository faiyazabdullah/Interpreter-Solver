MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the measure of angle DAB in a parallelogram ABCD. Let me start by recalling some properties of parallelograms because the problem mentions it's a parallelogram. 

First, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in length and opposite angles are equal. Also, consecutive angles are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. Additionally, the diagonals bisect each other, but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here. 

Now, looking at the given predicates. There are several angle measures and side lengths mentioned. Let me list them out again:

- Measure of Angle ADC is 59 degrees. Wait, Angle ADC would be at point D, between points A, D, C. But since ABCD is a parallelogram, maybe there are relations between these angles?

Wait, the first predicate says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A, D, C)), 59). So that's angle ADC, right? Because the middle letter is the vertex. So angle at D between A and C. Then another angle: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B, A, F)), 20). Hmm, wait, point F isn't mentioned elsewhere. Maybe there's a typo or perhaps F is part of another structure? Wait, the problem mentions parallelogram ABCD, so points A, B, C, D. Where does point F come into play? Maybe it's a typo, like maybe it should be angle BAF or something else? Or perhaps F is a point on one of the sides? This is confusing. Alternatively, maybe the original problem had more elements, but in the given predicates, there's mention of point F. Let me check again.

Wait, the second predicate is Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B, A, F)), 20). So angle at A between points B, A, F. So BA and AF form that angle. Similarly, third predicate is Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C, F, D)), 49), so angle at F between points C, F, D. So there's a point F involved here. But since the figure is a parallelogram ABCD, where is F located? Maybe F is on BC or AD? Not sure yet. But perhaps we need to consider that.

Also, there are lengths given: LengthOf(Line(A, D)) = 13, LengthOf(Line(D, C)) = 10. Since ABCD is a parallelogram, AD equals BC, and DC equals AB. Wait, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. So AD is one pair of opposite sides, so BC should be equal to AD, which is 13. But another length is given as Line(B, C) = 2x + 7. Wait, but BC is supposed to be equal to AD, which is 13. So maybe we can set 2x +7 = 13? That could be a way to find x. Similarly, Line(A, B) is 3y -8. Since AB equals CD, which is given as DC = 10. Therefore, AB = 10, so 3y -8 = 10, leading to y=6. But maybe that's useful later. However, the question is about angle DAB. Let me focus on that.

But first, the presence of point F complicates things. Let me think. If we have angle BAF = 20 degrees, and angle CFD = 49 degrees. Perhaps triangle AFB or something involving point F? Without knowing where F is, it's hard to tell. Maybe F is the intersection of diagonals? In a parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other. Let me assume that F is the intersection point of the diagonals AC and BD. Then, in that case, F would be the midpoint of both diagonals. But then, angle BAF would be part of triangle ABD. Wait, but how does that relate to the other angles given?

Alternatively, maybe F is a point on side BC? For example, if F is on BC such that BF is some segment. But without more info, it's unclear. However, given that there are two angles involving F, maybe we can use triangle properties.

Let me try to sketch mentally. Parallelogram ABCD, so AB is parallel to CD, AD parallel to BC. Diagonals intersect at F. Then, in that case, AF would be half of diagonal AC, and BF would be half of BD. But angles at A and F... Hmm. Let me try to think. If F is the intersection of diagonals, then in a parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other, so AF = FC and BF = FD. But angles at F would depend on the shape of the parallelogram.

But given that angle BAF is 20 degrees. So angle at A between BA and AF. Since AF is half of diagonal AC. Let me recall that in a parallelogram, the diagonals divide it into triangles. So triangle ABD and CBD. But maybe we can use triangle AFB. If I can find some relations here.

Alternatively, maybe F is a different point. Wait, the problem says "use parallelogram ABCD", so maybe F is a typo and should be another point? For example, maybe it's angle BAC instead of BAF? Or maybe there was a mislabeling. Alternatively, maybe the problem involves a triangle or another figure connected to the parallelogram. Without more info, this is tricky.

But let's see what else we know. We have angle ADC is 59 degrees. Since ABCD is a parallelogram, angle ADC is equal to angle ABC, because opposite angles in a parallelogram are equal. Also, consecutive angles are supplementary. So angle ADC + angle DAB = 180 degrees. Wait, angle ADC is at D, so adjacent to angle DAB. Wait, in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So angle DAB + angle ADC = 180 degrees. Therefore, if angle ADC is 59 degrees, then angle DAB would be 180 - 59 = 121 degrees. But none of the answer choices is 121. The options are 20, 59, 72, 101. So that suggests that my assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe angle ADC is not the same as angle ABC? Wait, in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So angle ADC is equal to angle ABC. And angle DAB is equal to angle BCD. So if angle ADC is 59, then angle ABC is also 59. Then angle DAB would be supplementary to angle ADC, so 180 - 59 = 121. Which is not among the choices. So that implies that either my understanding is incorrect, or there's more to the problem.

Wait, but maybe angle ADC is not referring to the standard angle in the parallelogram. Let me double-check the angle notation. The first predicate is Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A, D, C)), 59). So the angle at D, formed by points A, D, C. So that is angle ADC, yes. So that's one of the angles of the parallelogram. So according to that, angle ADC is 59 degrees. So angle DAB would be supplementary to that, giving 121, but that's not an option. Hence, there must be something wrong here. Maybe the figure is not a standard parallelogram, or there are other elements?

Wait, but the problem states that ABCD is a parallelogram. So that must hold. Unless there are other angles given that affect this. Wait, the other angles given involve point F. Let me check those again. The second predicate is angle BAF = 20 degrees, and angle CFD = 49 degrees. So if F is a point inside the parallelogram, maybe forming some triangles. Let me consider that possibility.

Assuming that F is the intersection of diagonals AC and BD. Then, in that case, diagonals split each other. So AF is part of diagonal AC. So angle BAF is part of triangle ABD. Let me try to compute that.

In a parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other, so AF = FC and BF = FD. Now, angle BAF is 20 degrees. Also, angle CFD is 49 degrees. Let me consider triangle AFD. Wait, angle at F between C and D. So angle CFD is the angle at F between points C, F, D. Since F is the intersection of diagonals, angle CFD would be vertical angles with angle AFB. Wait, but if diagonals intersect at F, then angle CFD is vertically opposite to angle AFB. Wait, but in that case, if angle CFD is 49 degrees, then angle AFB is also 49 degrees. But angle BAF is 20 degrees. So in triangle AFB, we have angle at A is 20 degrees, angle at F is 49 degrees, so the remaining angle at B would be 180 - 20 -49 = 111 degrees. 

But in the parallelogram, angle at B is equal to angle at D, which is angle ADC = 59 degrees. Wait, but according to this calculation, angle at B would be 111 degrees. Contradiction. So something is wrong here. Either my assumptions are incorrect or there's missing information. 

Wait, maybe the given angles are not in the standard configuration. Let me re-examine the problem statement. It says "use parallelogram ABCD". So ABCD is a parallelogram, so the order of the letters matters. So the vertices are in order A, B, C, D, making the sides AB, BC, CD, DA. So the diagonals are AC and BD. So point F is the intersection of diagonals. Then angle BAF is at point A between points B, A, F. So that's angle between BA and AF. Similarly, angle CFD is at point F between points C, F, D. So that's angle between CF and DF. 

So in triangle AFD, angle at F is 49 degrees. In triangle AFB, angle at F is 49 degrees. Wait, but earlier calculation suggested angle at B in triangle AFB would be 111 degrees. But in the parallelogram, angle at B is equal to angle at D, which is 59 degrees. So that contradicts. Therefore, there's inconsistency. Therefore, my assumption that F is the intersection of diagonals may be wrong. 

Alternatively, maybe F is a different point. For instance, suppose F is on side BC. Let me imagine that. Suppose F is somewhere along BC. Then angle BAF would be an angle at A between BA and AF. But without knowing where F is, it's hard to proceed. 

Alternatively, maybe F is a typo, and it's supposed to be angle BAD or something else. Alternatively, maybe the problem has a diagram that we don't have access to, and the labels are different. Given that the user included certain predicates, perhaps I need to rely on them regardless of my mental image.

Another thought: maybe the given angles are not internal angles of the parallelogram but some other angles. Let me try to consider all given data:

Given angles:

1. Angle ADC = 59°
2. Angle BAF = 20°
3. Angle CFD = 49°

Given lengths:

AD = 13, DC = 10, BC = 2x+7, AB = 3y-8.

Since ABCD is a parallelogram, AD = BC, so 2x+7 = 13 → x = 3. Also, DC = AB → 10 = 3y -8 → y = 6. These might be helpful later, but the question is about angle DAB.

But angle DAB is one of the angles of the parallelogram. Earlier calculation suggested it should be 180 - 59 = 121°, but that's not an option. So maybe the presence of point F introduces some other angles that affect this?

Alternatively, perhaps angle DAB is composed of parts. For example, angle DAB could be split into angle BAF and another angle. If angle BAF is 20°, and if there's another angle adjacent to it that adds up to angle DAB.

Wait, angle DAB is at point A, between points D, A, B. So if there's a point F such that AF splits angle DAB into two parts, say angle DAF and angle FAB. If angle BAF is 20°, then angle DAB = angle DAF + angle FAB. But unless we know angle DAF, we can't proceed. 

But how do we get angle DAF? If F lies on DC or something. Wait, but if F is on DC, then AF would be a line from A to F on DC. But without knowing where F is, it's hard to tell. 

Alternatively, considering triangle AFD. If angle CFD is 49°, which is at point F between C, F, D. If F is on DC, then angle CFD would be a straight angle, but that doesn't make sense. Or if F is somewhere else...

This seems too vague. Let me think differently. Since the answer options are 20, 59, 72, 101. Let me consider that angle DAB might be 101°, which is 59 + 42, or 20 + 81, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe combining angles from the given ones.

Wait, angle ADC is 59°, which is one of the angles of the parallelogram. So if we can find another angle that relates to angle DAB via some relation. 

Wait, in the parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. So angle DAB + angle ADC = 180°. So if angle ADC is 59°, then angle DAB = 180 - 59 = 121°, which is not an option. But the options don't have that. So this suggests that either the problem is not a standard parallelogram, or there's something else. 

Wait, but maybe angle ADC is not an interior angle? Like, maybe it's an exterior angle? No, the notation Angle(A, D, C) refers to the angle at D between points A and C, which would be the interior angle. 

Wait, unless the parallelogram is labeled differently. For example, if the points are ordered differently. Suppose the parallelogram is actually A, B, C, D in a different order. For example, maybe it's not A-B-C-D-A, but a different arrangement? But typically, a parallelogram is named in order, so ABCD would mean AB, BC, CD, DA as sides. 

Alternatively, maybe the given angle ADC is not the interior angle but some other angle. For example, if the parallelogram is folded or something, but that's unlikely. 

Wait, let me check the other given angles. Angle BAF is 20°, which is at point A. If angle DAB is being asked, then angle BAF is part of angle DAB. So if angle DAB is made up of angle BAF and another angle. Let me assume that. Suppose AF is a line from A to some point F, splitting angle DAB into two parts: angle DAF and angle FAB. Given that angle FAB is 20°, then angle DAB = angle DAF + 20°. If I can find angle DAF, then I can find angle DAB. 

How to find angle DAF? Well, if there's another angle given involving point F. The third given angle is angle CFD = 49°, which is at point F between C, F, D. So if we can relate this to triangle DAF or something. 

Assume that F is on DC. Then, line AF connects A to F on DC. Then, in triangle AFD, we have angle at D is angle ADC = 59°, angle at F is 49°, so angle at A (which is angle DAF) would be 180 - 59 - 49 = 72 degrees. Then, angle DAB would be angle DAF + angle FAB = 72 + 20 = 92 degrees. Still not matching the options. 

Alternatively, maybe angle CFD is part of triangle CFD, where F is on DC. Wait, if F is on DC, then angle CFD would be a straight angle, but that's not possible. So maybe F is not on DC. 

Alternatively, F is the intersection of AF and DC. Wait, but without knowing where F is, it's challenging. 

Wait, maybe using the Law of Sines or Cosines in some triangle. For example, if we consider triangle AFD, where we know angle at D (59°), angle at F (49°), so angle at A is 72°, as above. Then, if AF is a line from A to F, and we know lengths AD = 13, DC = 10. If F is on DC, then DF + FC = DC = 10. But without knowing where F is, we can't determine ratios. However, if we assume that AF divides DC in some proportion, but we don't have enough info. 

Alternatively, if we consider triangle AFD with angles 59°, 49°, and 72°, then using the Law of Sines, we could write ratios of sides. For example, AD / sin(angle at F) = AF / sin(angle at D). So AD / sin(49°) = AF / sin(59°). Plugging in AD = 13, we get AF = 13 * sin(59°) / sin(49°). Calculating that gives approximately 13 * 0.8572 / 0.7547 ≈ 13 * 1.136 ≈ 14.77. But I don't know if this helps us. 

However, if angle DAF is 72°, and angle FAB is 20°, then angle DAB = 72 + 20 = 92°, still not matching. 

Alternatively, maybe angle DAB is 59°, but that's already given as angle ADC. Or maybe angle DAB is 180 - 59 - 20 = 101°, which is one of the options. Wait, why subtract 20? If angle DAB is made up of angle DAC and angle CAB, but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, if angle BAF = 20°, and angle DAB = angle BAF + angle FAD, and angle FAD is related to the other given angle. But without knowing where F is, it's hard to say. 

Wait, perhaps there's a triangle involving angle CFD = 49°, which could be part of triangle CFD. If F is connected to C and D, then in triangle CFD, angle at F is 49°, and if we know other angles or sides, we could find something. But without knowing sides, this is difficult. 

But we do know DC = 10. If F is somewhere on DC, then maybe CF and FD are segments. But again, without knowing where F is, it's hard. 

Wait, maybe I should look back at the given lengths. AD = 13, DC = 10. If ABCD is a parallelogram, then AB = DC = 10, and BC = AD = 13. So AB = 10, BC = 13. But the given expression for BC is 2x +7 = 13 → x = 3. And AB = 3y -8 = 10 → y = 6. These might be distractions, but maybe they're used in another part. 

Alternatively, if we consider triangle ABC. Wait, but in a parallelogram, ABCD has AB || CD and AD || BC. So triangle ABC is not necessarily a right triangle, but maybe we can use the Law of Cosines to find angles. 

For example, in triangle ABC, we know sides AB = 10, BC = 13, and AC can be found using the Law of Cosines if we know angle ABC. But angle ABC is equal to angle ADC = 59°, since they are opposite angles in the parallelogram. So in triangle ABC, using Law of Cosines:

AC² = AB² + BC² - 2*AB*BC*cos(angle ABC)

Plugging in numbers:

AC² = 10² + 13² - 2*10*13*cos(59°)
Calculate that:

100 + 169 = 269
Then, 2*10*13 = 260
cos(59°) ≈ 0.5150
So AC² ≈ 269 - 260*0.5150 ≈ 269 - 133.9 ≈ 135.1
Thus, AC ≈ sqrt(135.1) ≈ 11.62 units.

But how does this help with angle DAB? 

Angle DAB is the angle at A between D and B. In the parallelogram, this angle can be found using the Law of Cosines in triangle ABD or something. Wait, but we need more info. 

Alternatively, using vectors or coordinates. Let me try coordinate geometry. Assume point A at origin (0,0). Since AD = 13, let me place point D at (13, 0). Since ABCD is a parallelogram, vector AB equals vector DC. Let me denote coordinates:

Let’s assign coordinates to make calculations easier. Let me set point A at (0, 0). Point D is at (13, 0), since AD = 13. Now, since ABCD is a parallelogram, vector AB should be equal to vector DC. Let me assume point B is at (a, b), then point C would be at (a + 13, b), since DC vector is (a, b) because DC = AB. 

But we also know DC = 10. Wait, DC is the length from D to C. Coordinates of D are (13, 0), coordinates of C are (a + 13, b). So DC vector is (a, b), so its length is sqrt(a² + b²) = 10. Also, AB vector is (a, b), so AB length is sqrt(a² + b²) = 10, which matches DC = 10. 

Additionally, BC length is 13. Coordinates of B are (a, b), coordinates of C are (a + 13, b). So BC vector is (13, 0), hence its length is 13, which matches the given BC = 13. 

So far, this setup works. Now, we need to find angle DAB, which is the angle at A between D and B. Vector AD is from A(0,0) to D(13,0), which is along the x-axis. Vector AB is from A(0,0) to B(a,b). The angle between AD (vector (13, 0)) and AB (vector (a, b)) is angle DAB. 

The formula for the angle θ between two vectors u and v is:

cosθ = (u · v) / (|u| |v|)

Here, u = AD vector (13, 0), v = AB vector (a, b).

Dot product u · v = 13*a + 0*b = 13a

|u| = 13, |v| = 10 (since AB length is 10)

Therefore,

cosθ = (13a)/(13*10) = a/10

So θ = arccos(a/10)

We need to find a. How?

From earlier, we know that DC vector is (a, b), which has length 10, so a² + b² = 100. Also, angle ADC is 59 degrees. What is angle ADC? At point D, between points A, D, C. 

Point D is at (13, 0). Point C is at (a + 13, b). Point A is at (0, 0). So angle ADC is the angle at D between points A, D, C. To calculate this angle, we can use vectors DA and DC.

Vector DA is A - D = (0 - 13, 0 - 0) = (-13, 0)

Vector DC is C - D = (a + 13 - 13, b - 0) = (a, b)

So angle ADC is the angle between vectors DA (-13, 0) and DC (a, b). The cosine of this angle is:

[DA · DC] / (|DA| |DC|)

DA · DC = (-13)*a + 0*b = -13a

|DA| = 13, |DC| = 10

So cos(angle ADC) = (-13a)/(13*10) = -a/10

Given that angle ADC is 59 degrees, so:

cos(59°) = -a/10 → a = -10 * cos(59°)

Compute cos(59°): approximately 0.5150

So a ≈ -10 * 0.5150 ≈ -5.15

Therefore, a ≈ -5.15

Now, going back to angle DAB, which is θ = arccos(a/10) = arccos(-5.15/10) = arccos(-0.515)

Calculating arccos(-0.515):

Since cos(121°) ≈ cos(180° - 59°) = -cos(59°) ≈ -0.515, so arccos(-0.515) ≈ 121°, which matches our initial calculation. But this isn't among the answer choices. 

Hmm, this suggests that the answer should be 121°, but it's not listed. This indicates that either the problem has additional constraints not considered, or there's a misunderstanding in the setup. 

Wait, but the problem includes other predicates involving point F. Maybe these are essential. Let me revisit those. 

Given angle BAF = 20°, and angle CFD = 49°. Let's try to incorporate these into the coordinate system.

Point F is involved in these angles. Assuming F is somewhere in the plane. Let me think about angle BAF = 20°. This is the angle at A between points B, A, F. So vector AB and AF form a 20° angle. 

In our coordinate system, point A is at (0,0), point B is at (a, b) ≈ (-5.15, b). Need to find coordinates of F such that angle BAF is 20°. 

Also, angle CFD = 49°. This is the angle at F between points C, F, D. 

This seems complicated, but perhaps we can find coordinates of F. 

Let me attempt to parametrize AF. Since angle BAF is 20°, and AB is the vector from A to B, which is (a, b). So AF is a ray from A making 20° with AB. 

To find coordinates of F, we need to define it such that this angle holds. But without more information, it's challenging. 

Alternatively, maybe F lies on DC? Let's assume F is on DC. Then, coordinates of F would be somewhere between D(13,0) and C(a + 13, b). Let me parameterize DC. Let me express F as D + t*(DC vector), where t ∈ [0,1]. 

Vector DC is (a, b), so F = D + t*(a, b) = (13 + ta, 0 + tb) = (13 + ta, tb). 

Now, angle BAF is 20°. Let's find t such that this condition holds. 

Vector AF goes from A(0,0) to F(13 + ta, tb). Vector AB goes from A(0,0) to B(a, b). 

The angle between AF and AB is 20°. Using the dot product:

cos(20°) = (AF · AB) / (|AF| |AB|)

AF · AB = (13 + ta)a + (tb)b = 13a + ta² + tb²

|AF| = sqrt((13 + ta)^2 + (tb)^2)

|AB| = sqrt(a² + b²) = 10

So:

[13a + t(a² + b²)] / [sqrt((13 + ta)^2 + (tb)^2) * 10] = cos(20°)

We know a² + b² = 100, so substitute:

Numerator becomes 13a + t*100

Denominator becomes sqrt[(13 + ta)^2 + (tb)^2] * 10

So:

[13a + 100t]/[sqrt((13 + ta)^2 + (tb)^2) * 10] = cos(20°)

This equation needs to be solved for t. But we already know a ≈ -5.15. Let's plug in a = -5.15, and b² = 100 - a² ≈ 100 - 26.52 ≈ 73.48, so b ≈ ±8.57.

Let me take a = -5.15, b = 8.57 (assuming positive y-coordinate for simplicity).

So:

Numerator: 13*(-5.15) + 100t ≈ -66.95 + 100t

Denominator: sqrt[(13 + t*(-5.15))^2 + (t*8.57)^2] * 10

Let me simplify the denominator:

Inside the square root:

(13 - 5.15t)^2 + (8.57t)^2 = [169 - 2*13*5.15t + (5.15)^2 t²] + (8.57^2)t²

Calculate coefficients:

First term: 169 - 132.9t + 26.52t²

Second term: 73.44t²

Total under sqrt: 169 - 132.9t + (26.52 + 73.44)t² = 169 - 132.9t + 99.96t²

So denominator becomes sqrt(99.96t² - 132.9t + 169) * 10

So the entire equation is:

[-66.95 + 100t]/[sqrt(99.96t² - 132.9t + 169) * 10] = cos(20°) ≈ 0.9397

Multiply both sides by denominator:

-66.95 + 100t = 0.9397 * 10 * sqrt(99.96t² - 132.9t + 169)

Simplify RHS: 9.397 * sqrt(...)

This looks complex, but perhaps we can square both sides to eliminate the square root. Let me denote LHS = -66.95 + 100t, RHS = 9.397 * sqrt(...)

Square both sides:

LHS² = (100t - 66.95)^2 = 10000t² - 2*100*66.95t + 66.95² ≈ 10000t² - 13390t + 4482.3

RHS² = (9.397)^2 * (99.96t² - 132.9t + 169) ≈ 88.3 * (99.96t² - 132.9t + 169) ≈ 88.3*99.96t² - 88.3*132.9t + 88.3*169

Calculate each term:

88.3*99.96 ≈ 88.3*100 - 88.3*0.04 ≈ 8830 - 3.532 ≈ 8826.468

88.3*132.9 ≈ Let's approximate 88.3 * 130 = 11479, plus 88.3*2.9 ≈ 256.07 → total ≈ 11735.07

88.3*169 ≈ 88.3 * 170 - 88.3 = 14991 - 88.3 ≈ 14902.7

So RHS² ≈ 8826.468t² - 11735.07t + 14902.7

Setting LHS² = RHS²:

10000t² - 13390t + 4482.3 ≈ 8826.468t² - 11735.07t + 14902.7

Bring all terms to left side:

10000t² - 13390t + 4482.3 - 8826.468t² + 11735.07t - 14902.7 ≈ 0

Combine like terms:

(10000 - 8826.468)t² + (-13390 + 11735.07)t + (4482.3 - 14902.7) ≈ 0

Which is:

1173.532t² - 1654.93t - 10420.4 ≈ 0

Divide all terms by, say, 1173.532 to simplify:

t² - (1654.93/1173.532)t - (10420.4/1173.532) ≈ 0

Calculate coefficients:

1654.93 / 1173.532 ≈ 1.41

10420.4 / 1173.532 ≈ 8.88

So equation becomes approximately:

t² - 1.41t - 8.88 = 0

Solving quadratic equation:

t = [1.41 ± sqrt(1.41² + 4*8.88)] / 2

Calculate discriminant:

1.41² + 35.52 ≈ 1.9881 + 35.52 ≈ 37.5081

sqrt(37.5081) ≈ 6.124

Thus, t ≈ [1.41 ± 6.124]/2

Positive root: (1.41 + 6.124)/2 ≈ 7.534/2 ≈ 3.767

Negative root: (1.41 - 6.124)/2 ≈ -4.714/2 ≈ -2.357

Since t represents a parameter along DC from D to C (t ∈ [0,1]), t ≈ 3.767 is outside this range, and negative t is also invalid. Thus, no valid solution? This suggests that our assumption that F is on DC is incorrect. 

This implies that point F is not on DC, and thus my previous approaches are flawed. Given the complexity, maybe there's a simpler approach using the given angles and parallelogram properties.

Let me revisit the initial idea that angle DAB = 180 - angle ADC = 121°, but since this isn't an option, perhaps the given angles involving F provide a way to adjust this. 

Suppose that angle DAB is composed of angle BAF (20°) and some other angle. If we can find that other angle, say, angle FAD, and sum them. 

From earlier, in the coordinate system, we found that a ≈ -5.15, which gave us angle DAB ≈ 121°. But if there's a point F such that angle BAF = 20°, and angle FAD is something, maybe related to the other given angle of 49°. 

If angle CFD = 49°, and assuming F is somewhere such that triangle CFD has this angle, maybe there's a relationship between angles in the parallelogram. 

Alternatively, since angle ADC is 59°, and angle CFD is 49°, maybe these angles are part of a larger triangle or transversal. 

Wait, in the parallelogram, angle ADC is 59°, and if we draw a line from D to F such that angle CFD is 49°, then maybe triangle DCF has angles adding up to 180°. But without knowing other angles or sides, it's hard to proceed. 

Given the time I've spent without success, perhaps I should reconsider the initial assumption about the parallelogram's angles. Maybe the given angle ADC is not the standard interior angle. For example, if the parallelogram is labeled differently, or if the angle is external. 

Wait, if angle ADC is 59°, and it's an exterior angle, then the interior angle would be 180 - 59 = 121°, which still leads to the same issue. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves a different type of quadrilateral, but it specifies a parallelogram. 

Wait, let me check if the given angles could be alternate angles or something. For example, if angle BAF = 20° is an alternate interior angle with respect to some transversal. 

Alternatively, since angle BAF is 20°, and angle DAB is what we want, if AF is a transversal creating some relationship. 

But without knowing the position of F, it's hard to say. 

At this point, given the time I've invested without resolving the discrepancy, I'll have to consider that perhaps the intended answer is 101°, which is 59 + 42, or 20 + 81, or something. Alternatively, since angle ADC is 59°, angle CFD is 49°, and angle BAF is 20°, maybe adding 20 + 49 = 69, and 180 - 69 = 111, which isn't an option. 

Wait, another thought: in the parallelogram, the sum of all angles is 360°. Two angles are 59° each (opposite angles), and the other two are equal. So total is 2*59 + 2*x = 360 → 118 + 2x = 360 → 2x = 242 → x = 121°. So the other two angles are 121°, which would be angle DAB and angle BCD. But this again suggests 121°, not in options. 

But the answer choices are A. 20, B. 59, C. 72, D. 101. None of these are 121. This implies that perhaps the given angles involving F are meant to modify this calculation. 

Maybe angle DAB is 180 - (59 + 20) = 101°. Let me see: if angle ADC is 59°, and angle BAF is 20°, and somehow these combine to give 101°. 

For example, if angle DAB is supplementary to the sum of angle ADC and angle BAF. But why would that be? 

Alternatively, if angle DAB = angle ADC + angle BAF = 59 + 20 = 79°, not an option. 

Or, if angle DAB = 180 - (59 - 20) = 151°, nope. 

Wait, if we consider triangle AFD where angle at D is 59°, angle at F is 49°, then angle at A is 72°, and if that 72° is part of angle DAB, then adding angle BAF 20° would give 92°, still not matching. 

Alternatively, if angle DAB is 180 - (59 + 49) = 72°, which is option C. 

Wait, 180 - (59 + 49) = 72. This is option C. Could this be the case? Why would it be 180 - (angle ADC + angle CFD)? 

Maybe there's a triangle or some configuration where those two angles add up to a supplementary angle to DAB. 

If I assume that angle DAB = 180 - (59 + 49) = 72°, then option C is correct. This is speculative, but given the lack of better ideas, and since 72 is one of the options, this might be the intended answer. 

Perhaps the given angles ADC and CFD are part of a triangle that forms a linear pair with angle DAB. 

Alternatively, in triangle AFD, angles sum to 180°, so angle at A is 180 - 59 - 49 = 72°, which could be part of angle DAB. If angle BAF is 20°, then angle DAB = 72° + 20° = 92°, which isn't an option. But if angle DAB is just the 72°, then it's option C. 

Maybe the 20° is part of another angle, and the main angle is 72°. 

Given the lack of clarity and the fact that 72 is an option, I'll go with option C.
