Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the given information:

1. RightAngle(Angle(D,A,B)): So angle at point A between points D and B is a right angle. That means triangle DAB is a right triangle with the right angle at A.
2. Isosceles(Triangle(A,B,D)): Triangle ABD is isosceles. Since it's isosceles, two sides must be equal. But since we already have a right angle at A, the legs AD and AB would be equal? Wait, but the right angle is at A, so the two legs would be AD and AB. Therefore, if it's isosceles, those legs are equal. So AD = AB.
3. Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,B)), 32): The length of DB is 32 units. In triangle ABD, which is a right triangle at A, DB would be the hypotenuse. So by Pythagoras, AD² + AB² = DB². But since AD = AB (from the isosceles triangle), let me denote AD = AB = x. Then 2x² = 32² → x² = (32²)/2 → x = 32 / √2 ≈ 22.627... But maybe there's more here?
Wait, but maybe I should check again. The triangle ABD has a right angle at A, and it's isosceles. So yes, legs AD and AB are equal. Therefore, AB equals AD. So AB = AD = 32 / sqrt(2) ≈ 22.627. However, there's also another part about the measure of angle CAB being 54 degrees. Hmm, that's angle at A between points C and B. Wait, but the previous angle was at A between D and B. So perhaps point C is somewhere else?

Next, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,B)), 54). So angle at A between points C and B is 54 degrees. So angle CAB is 54 degrees. Also, IsPerpendicularBisectorOf(Line(B,A),Triangle(D,C,A)). Wait, that's saying that Line BC is the perpendicular bisector of BA? Or wait, the wording is: IsPerpendicularBisectorOf(Line(B,A),Triangle(D,C,A)). Wait, maybe it's that line DC is the perpendicular bisector of BA? Wait, the syntax might be confusing. Let me think again. The predicate says IsPerpendicularBisectorOf(Line(B,A),Triangle(D,C,A)). So the line that is a perpendicular bisector of BA is something related to triangle DCA? Maybe the line DC is the perpendicular bisector of BA. Because the second argument is the triangle, so perhaps DC is the perpendicular bisector of BA. 

So if DC is the perpendicular bisector of BA, then DC passes through the midpoint of BA and is perpendicular to BA. Since BA is a line segment, its midpoint would be at (B + A)/2. And DC is perpendicular to BA. Also, since DC is a perpendicular bisector, then point D lies on DC? Wait, the triangle mentioned is DCA, so points D, C, A. So DC is part of triangle DCA. So if DC is the perpendicular bisector of BA, then DC must pass through the midpoint of BA and be perpendicular to BA. 

Let me try to sketch this mentally. Points A and B are connected by BA. Point D is such that triangle ABD is right and isosceles. Then, DC is the perpendicular bisector of BA. So point C must lie somewhere along DC, which is the perpendicular bisector. Also, angle CAB is 54 degrees. So point C is positioned such that when you connect A to C, angle CAB is 54 degrees. 

Also, we need to find LengthOf(Line(A,C)) = x. So AC is the length we need to find. Given that, let me see how to connect these elements.

First, let's consider coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to the points could help. Let me place point A at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since BA is a line segment, and DC is the perpendicular bisector of BA. Let me assume BA is horizontal for easier calculation. Let me define coordinates:

Let’s set point A at (0,0). Let me assume BA is along the x-axis. Let me denote the midpoint of BA as M. Since DC is the perpendicular bisector of BA, DC must pass through M and be vertical (since BA is horizontal). 

But first, need to determine coordinates of B. From earlier, triangle ABD is a right isosceles triangle with right angle at A. So AD = AB. Let me suppose AB = AD = t. Then, since BA is along x-axis from A(0,0) to B(t,0). Then point D, since triangle ABD is right-angled at A, and AD = AB, so D would be at (0,t), making AD vertical. Wait, because AD would be perpendicular to AB. So AB is horizontal from (0,0) to (t,0). AD is vertical from (0,0) up to (0,t). Then BD connects (t,0) to (0,t), which has length sqrt((t)^2 + (t)^2) = t√2. According to the given, BD is 32. So t√2 = 32 → t = 32 / √2 = 16√2 ≈ 22.627. So AB = t = 16√2, AD = same. Coordinates:

A: (0,0)
B: (t, 0) = (16√2, 0)
D: (0, t) = (0, 16√2)

Now, the line DC is the perpendicular bisector of BA. The midpoint M of BA is at ((t/2), 0). Since BA is horizontal, the perpendicular bisector is vertical line passing through M. So DC is vertical line through M. So DC is the line x = t/2. Now, point D is at (0, t), and point C is somewhere on this vertical line. Wait, but DC is the perpendicular bisector. So DC is the entire line, but in the context of triangle DCA. So point C must be on DC. Wait, but DC is from D(0, t) to some point C on the vertical line x = t/2. Wait, but D is at (0, t), so DC would be a line starting at D(0, t) going towards the vertical line x = t/2. Wait, but the perpendicular bisector is the vertical line x = t/2. So DC is part of that line. Therefore, point C is somewhere on x = t/2. But since DC is the perpendicular bisector, does that mean that DC is entirely the perpendicular bisector? Or just that DC is one of the segments forming the perpendicular bisector?

Alternatively, maybe the line DC is the perpendicular bisector of BA. So line DC must be the vertical line through M, i.e., x = t/2. Therefore, points D and C must lie on this line. But D is at (0, t), which isn't on x = t/2 unless t=0, which it isn't. Wait, that seems contradictory. There's an error here.

Wait, the predicate says IsPerpendicularBisectorOf(Line(B,A),Triangle(D,C,A)). So the line that is the perpendicular bisector of BA is part of triangle DCA. Which suggests that the line DC is the perpendicular bisector of BA. But if DC is the perpendicular bisector of BA, then DC must be the line that is perpendicular to BA and passes through its midpoint. So DC is the vertical line x = t/2. However, point D is at (0, t), which is not on this line. Unless there's a miscalculation here.

Wait, maybe my assumption about where D is located is wrong. Let me re-examine triangle ABD. It's a right triangle at A, isosceles. So legs are AD and AB. Therefore, AD = AB. So if BA is along x-axis from (0,0) to (a,0), then AD would be vertical from (0,0) to (0,a). Then BD connects (a,0) to (0,a), which is length a√2. So BD = a√2 = 32 → a = 32 / √2 = 16√2. So that's correct.

But then the perpendicular bisector of BA is the vertical line through midpoint M(a/2, 0). So DC must be this line. However, point D is at (0,a), which is not on x = a/2. Therefore, unless point C is chosen such that line DC is the perpendicular bisector. Wait, but DC is a line connecting D(0,a) to C. For DC to be the perpendicular bisector of BA, it needs to be the vertical line x = a/2. Therefore, line DC must coincide with x = a/2. So point D(0,a) must lie on x = a/2? Only if a = 0, which it isn't. Therefore, contradiction. This suggests that my initial coordinate assignment may be incorrect.

Hmm, so perhaps my assumption about the position of D is wrong. Let me reconsider. Maybe triangle ABD is right-angled at A, but not necessarily with legs AB and AD. Wait, the right angle is at A, so the sides adjacent to A are AB and AD. So yes, AB and AD are the legs. Hence, they are equal in length because it's isosceles. So AB = AD.

But if DC is the perpendicular bisector of BA, then line DC must be perpendicular to BA and pass through its midpoint. So BA is horizontal, so DC must be vertical. Therefore, DC must be vertical. Therefore, points D and C must lie on the same vertical line. But D is at (0,a), which is not on the vertical line through midpoint of BA. So unless there's a different configuration.

Wait, maybe the triangle is not placed as I thought. Perhaps point D is not directly above A. Wait, but if angle at A is right, then AB and AD must be perpendicular. So AB and AD are perpendicular. So if AB is along x-axis from A(0,0) to B(b,0), then AD is vertical from A(0,0) to D(0,d). Then BD is from (b,0) to (0,d), which has length sqrt(b² + d²). Since triangle ABD is isosceles, then AB = AD → b = d. Therefore, BD length is sqrt(2b²) = b√2. Given that BD = 32, so b√2 = 32 → b = 32 / √2 = 16√2. So AB = AD = 16√2.

Now, the perpendicular bisector of BA is the vertical line through midpoint M of BA. Midpoint M is at (b/2, 0). So the perpendicular bisector is the line x = b/2. Now, for DC to be this perpendicular bisector, the line DC must be x = b/2. But D is at (0, b), so unless line DC is the vertical line x = b/2. That requires that point D lies on x = b/2. But D is at (0,b), which is not on x = b/2 unless b=0. Contradiction. Therefore, there's a mistake here. How can DC be the perpendicular bisector of BA if D is not on that line?

Ah! Wait, the predicate says IsPerpendicularBisectorOf(Line(B,A),Triangle(D,C,A)). So the line that is the perpendicular bisector of BA is DC. So the line DC is the perpendicular bisector. Therefore, line DC must be the perpendicular bisector of BA, which is the vertical line through M. So line DC must be that vertical line. But since D is at (0,b), then for line DC to be the vertical line x = b/2, point D must be on that line. But D is at (0,b), which would require that 0 = b/2 → b=0, which is impossible. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. What's wrong?

Maybe my interpretation of the predicate is incorrect. Perhaps the line DC is the perpendicular bisector of BA. But DC is not the entire line, but rather the line segment DC. But even then, the line containing DC must be the perpendicular bisector. So line DC must be the vertical line through M. Therefore, points D and C must lie on that line. So D is on the perpendicular bisector. But according to our previous setup, D is at (0,b), which is not on x = b/2. So there's inconsistency. Therefore, my initial assumption about the placement of D is wrong.

Alternative approach: Maybe triangle ABD is right-angled at A, but not with AB and AD as legs. Wait, but the right angle is at A, so the two legs must be AB and AD. So AB and AD are the legs. So they are perpendicular. Therefore, my previous setup holds. So why is there a conflict with DC being the perpendicular bisector of BA?

Perhaps I need to adjust the coordinates. Let me try placing point A at (0,0), point B at (b,0), and point D at (0,c), making sure that AB and AD are perpendicular. Since it's an isosceles right triangle, AB = AD → b = c. So D is at (0,b). Then BD connects (b,0) to (0,b), length sqrt(2b²) = b√2 = 32 → b = 32 / √2 = 16√2.

Now, the perpendicular bisector of BA is the vertical line x = b/2. So line DC must be this vertical line. Therefore, both points D and C must lie on x = b/2. But point D is at (0,b), which is not on x = b/2 unless b=0. Contradiction. Therefore, there's a mistake here. How can DC be the perpendicular bisector of BA if D is not on that line?

Wait, maybe the line DC is not the entire line, but just a segment. But the perpendicular bisector of BA is a line, not a segment. So DC must be a part of that line. But since D is not on that line, this seems impossible. Therefore, there must be an error in my understanding of the predicate.

Wait, the predicate is IsPerpendicularBisectorOf(Line(B,A),Triangle(D,C,A)). Maybe it's not that DC is the perpendicular bisector, but that the triangle DCA has DC as its perpendicular bisector? No, the predicate structure is IsPerpendicularBisectorOf(Line(X,Y), Triangle(...)), so it likely refers to the line being the perpendicular bisector of the segment BA. So the line DC must be the perpendicular bisector of BA. Thus, line DC is the perpendicular bisector. So line DC must be the vertical line through M. Hence, points D and C must lie on this line. Therefore, D must lie on x = b/2. But earlier, D is at (0,b). So this implies that 0 = b/2 → b=0. Not possible. Therefore, my assumption about the location of D is wrong.

Alternative idea: Maybe the triangle ABD is right-angled at A, but with AB and AD not being the legs. Wait, but the right angle is at A, so AB and AD must be the legs. So they are perpendicular. So my previous setup is correct. Hence, the only way for DC to be the perpendicular bisector is if D is on the perpendicular bisector. So this suggests that my coordinate system is wrong.

Wait, maybe I misread the predicate. Let me recheck: IsPerpendicularBisectorOf(Line(B,A),Triangle(D,C,A)). So the line that is the perpendicular bisector of BA is part of triangle DCA. So the line DC is the perpendicular bisector of BA. So DC is the perpendicular bisector, hence it must pass through the midpoint of BA and be perpendicular to BA. Therefore, DC must pass through midpoint M of BA and be perpendicular to BA. So DC is a line that starts at D and goes through M, and is perpendicular to BA. Therefore, point D is not necessarily on the perpendicular bisector, but the line DC is the perpendicular bisector. So point D is not on the perpendicular bisector, but the line DC is. So D is one endpoint of the line DC, which is the perpendicular bisector. Therefore, line DC must start at D, go through M, and extend to C. So point D is not on the perpendicular bisector, but the line DC is the perpendicular bisector. Wait, but that would mean that line DC is the perpendicular bisector of BA, which requires that line DC is perpendicular to BA and passes through M. So, if DC is perpendicular to BA and passes through M, then DC is the perpendicular bisector.

So, given that BA is horizontal (as before), then DC must be vertical. So line DC is vertical, passing through M (midpoint of BA). Therefore, the line DC is vertical and passes through M(b/2, 0). So point D is somewhere not on this line, but the line DC is the vertical line through M. Therefore, line DC starts at D, goes upward/downward through M, and ends at C. Wait, but D is fixed. Let me think. Suppose line DC is the vertical line through M. So point D is not on this line, but line DC passes through M. Therefore, D is not on the line, but the line DC contains M. Therefore, D is not on the line, but the line DC is defined by points D and C, and it passes through M. So line DC passes through M, and is perpendicular to BA.

Therefore, given that BA is horizontal, line DC is vertical. So the slope of DC is undefined (vertical). Therefore, DC is vertical. So points D and C are aligned vertically, with the line passing through M. Let me formalize this.

Since line DC is vertical and passes through M(b/2, 0), then points D and C must lie on this vertical line. Therefore, their x-coordinate is b/2. But earlier, we had D at (0,b). This would require that 0 = b/2 → b=0, which is impossible. So contradiction again. 

This suggests that my initial assumptions about the coordinates are incorrect. Perhaps the right angle is not at A? Wait, the first predicate says RightAngle(Angle(D,A,B)), which means the angle at A between D and B is a right angle. So yes, the right angle is at A. So AB and AD are perpendicular. So D is not on the vertical line through M. So there's a conflict. How can line DC be the perpendicular bisector of BA if D is not on that line?

Wait, maybe the line DC is not the entire vertical line, but just a segment. But the perpendicular bisector is a line, not a segment. So the line DC must be the perpendicular bisector, hence passing through M and being perpendicular to BA. So if DC is the perpendicular bisector, then it must contain M. Therefore, line DC passes through M. So points D and C are on this line. Therefore, D is on the perpendicular bisector. But earlier, D is at (0,b), which would imply that 0 = b/2 → b=0. So this suggests that my coordinate system is flawed.

Alternative approach: Let's forget coordinates and think differently. Since DC is the perpendicular bisector of BA, then DC passes through midpoint of BA and is perpendicular to BA. So midpoint M of BA is crucial. Also, since DC is the perpendicular bisector, then BM = AM = AB/2. Also, since DC is perpendicular to BA, angle between DC and BA is 90 degrees.

Given that, let me consider triangle ABC. We know angle CAB is 54 degrees. So in triangle ABC, angle at A is 54 degrees. Also, we need to find AC = x.

But how do these pieces fit together?

From the given, triangle ABD is right and isosceles, with AB = AD, right angle at A. BD = 32. So AB = AD = 32 / √2 = 16√2. Let me calculate that numerically: 16*1.414 ≈ 22.627.

Now, since DC is the perpendicular bisector of BA, then DM = MB, where M is midpoint of BA. Wait, no, DC is the perpendicular bisector, so it passes through M. So M is the midpoint of BA. Also, since DC is perpendicular to BA, then DC is perpendicular to BA at M. So DC is the altitude from M to BA, but since it's a bisector, it's the perpendicular bisector.

Wait, but how does point D come into play? Since DC is the perpendicular bisector of BA, and D is a vertex of triangle ABD. So point D must lie on the perpendicular bisector of BA? Or is it that the line DC is the perpendicular bisector?

If DC is the perpendicular bisector, then point D must lie on this line. Because DC is the line itself. So if DC is the perpendicular bisector, then D is on it. So D is on the perpendicular bisector of BA. But earlier, we had D forming a right isosceles triangle with AB. Let me try to reconcile this.

Let me assume that D is on the perpendicular bisector of BA. So D lies on the line that is the perpendicular bisector of BA. Since BA's midpoint is M, and the perpendicular bisector is the line through M perpendicular to BA. Let me define BA horizontally, so the perpendicular bisector is vertical line through M. So D lies on this vertical line. Let me assign coordinates again with this in mind.

Let me set point A at (0,0), B at (2m, 0) so that midpoint M is at (m, 0). The perpendicular bisector is the vertical line x = m. So point D is somewhere on x = m. Since triangle ABD is right-angled at A, and is isosceles. So AB = AD. AB is the distance from A(0,0) to B(2m, 0), which is 2m. AD is the distance from A(0,0) to D(m, k), where k is some y-coordinate. Since triangle ABD is right-angled at A, vectors AB and AD are perpendicular. AB vector is (2m, 0), AD vector is (m, k). Their dot product is 2m*m + 0*k = 2m². For them to be perpendicular, this should be zero. But 2m² ≠ 0 unless m=0. Contradiction. So this suggests that my assumption is wrong.

Wait, if triangle ABD is right-angled at A, then AB and AD are perpendicular. But if D is on the perpendicular bisector of BA (which is x=m), then AD is from A(0,0) to D(m, k). Vector AB is (2m, 0), vector AD is (m, k). For AB and AD to be perpendicular, their dot product must be zero: (2m)(m) + (0)(k) = 2m² = 0 → m=0. Again, contradiction. So this suggests that D cannot be on the perpendicular bisector of BA if triangle ABD is right-angled at A and isosceles. Therefore, there's a fundamental inconsistency here. What am I missing?

Wait, perhaps the right angle is not at A? But the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(D,A,B)), which means angle at A between D and B is a right angle. So it's definitely at A. So AB and AD are perpendicular. So their vectors must be perpendicular. But if D is on the perpendicular bisector of BA, then AB · AD = 2m² ≠ 0. So this is impossible. Hence, my conclusion is that there's a contradiction unless m=0, which is invalid. This suggests that there's a misunderstanding of the predicate.

Let me revisit the predicate: IsPerpendicularBisectorOf(Line(B,A),Triangle(D,C,A)). Perhaps it means that the triangle DCA has DC as its perpendicular bisector? No, the predicate is about the line being the perpendicular bisector of the segment BA. So line DC is the perpendicular bisector of BA. So line DC must be perpendicular to BA and pass through its midpoint M. So line DC is the perpendicular bisector. Hence, DC must be the line that is both perpendicular to BA and passes through M.

But for this to happen, D must be on this line. Otherwise, how can DC be this line? If D is not on this line, then line DC would not be the perpendicular bisector. Hence, D must lie on the perpendicular bisector of BA. But earlier, this leads to a contradiction with the right angle at A.

Wait, unless the right angle is not between AB and AD, but between DA and something else? No, the angle is specified as Angle(D,A,B), which is angle at A between D and B. So it's between AD and AB. Hence, they must be perpendicular. So this brings us back to the earlier contradiction.

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to consider that the perpendicular bisector of BA is not DC, but another line. Wait, the predicate says IsPerpendicularBisectorOf(Line(B,A),Triangle(D,C,A)). So maybe it's referring to the line that is the perpendicular bisector of BA, which is part of triangle DCA. So the line DC is the perpendicular bisector of BA. So DC is the perpendicular bisector, hence passing through M and perpendicular to BA. So DC is this line. So point D is not on it, but the line DC is. Wait, but how can a line pass through M and be DC? If D is not on it, then DC is a line starting at D and passing through M. So line DC extends from D through M to C. So D is not on the perpendicular bisector, but the line DC includes the perpendicular bisector. So the line DC passes through M and is perpendicular to BA. Hence, line DC is the perpendicular bisector.

In this case, since DC is perpendicular to BA, and passes through M, then the direction of DC is vertical if BA is horizontal. So let me try to assign coordinates again with this understanding.

Let me set BA horizontally, with A at (0,0), B at (2m, 0), so that M is at (m, 0). The perpendicular bisector is vertical line x = m. Now, line DC is this vertical line. So line DC passes through M(m,0) and is vertical. So point D is somewhere not on this line, but line DC passes through M. So line DC starts at D, goes through M, and ends at C. So D is not on x=m, but the line DC passes through x=m. Hence, the line DC has equation x = m. So points D and C are such that line DC is x = m. So point D has x-coordinate not equal to m, but the line DC is x=m. Wait, that's impossible. A line has a single x-coordinate if it's vertical. So if line DC is x=m, then both D and C must have x=m. Hence, D is on x=m. But earlier, this led to contradictions with the right angle at A.

This suggests that the only way for DC to be the perpendicular bisector is if D is on x=m. So let me try again with D on x=m.

Let me set A at (0,0), B at (2m, 0), so M is at (m, 0). Let D be at (m, k), since it's on the perpendicular bisector. Now, triangle ABD is right-angled at A. So vectors AB and AD must be perpendicular. AB is (2m, 0), AD is (m, k). Dot product is 2m * m + 0 * k = 2m². For them to be perpendicular, this must be zero → 2m² = 0 → m=0. Again, contradiction. So this is impossible.

What's the issue here? It seems like there's a contradiction between the right angle at A and DC being the perpendicular bisector of BA. This suggests that either the problem has no solution, or I'm misinterpreting the predicates.

Wait, perhaps the right angle is not between AB and AD, but between AD and another side? No, the predicate specifies Angle(D,A,B), which is angle at A between D and B. So it's between AD and AB. Hence, they must be perpendicular. 

Another possibility: Maybe the triangle is not right-angled at A, but the angle is right? No, the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(D,A,B)), so it is right-angled at A.

I'm stuck. Let me try to look for alternative approaches without coordinates. 

We know that in triangle ABD, right-angled and isosceles, so AB = AD, and BD = 32. So AB = AD = 32 / √2. 

Now, DC is the perpendicular bisector of BA. So it passes through midpoint M of BA and is perpendicular to BA. So, let's consider that DC is this line. Since it's a perpendicular bisector, then any point on DC is equidistant from B and A. So, for example, point D is on DC? If so, then DA = DB. Wait, but DA is equal to AB, and DB is given as 32. So if DA = DB, then DA = 32. But DA is AB = 32 / √2. So 32 / √2 = 32 → √2 = 1, which is false. So this suggests that D is not on the perpendicular bisector. Hence, contradiction again.

Wait, but if DC is the perpendicular bisector, then point C is on it. So point C is equidistant from B and A. But D is not on it. 

Let me try to focus on what's needed to find AC. We need to find the length of AC, given angle CAB is 54 degrees. So in triangle ABC, angle at A is 54 degrees, and we need to find AC. But what is AB? AB is known: AB = 32 / √2. Wait, from earlier, BD = 32, and in the isosceles right triangle ABD, AB = AD = 32 / √2. So AB = 16√2 ≈ 22.627. 

If we can find the relationship between AC and AB, using the given angle of 54 degrees, maybe via the Law of Sines or Cosines. But how?

But we need more information about triangle ABC. We know angle at A is 54 degrees, and we need to find AC. But what about other sides or angles?

Wait, perhaps triangle ADC is involved. Since DC is the perpendicular bisector of BA, and we have point C on it. Let me think: Since DC is the perpendicular bisector of BA, then C is equidistant from B and A. So CB = CA. Wait, because C is on the perpendicular bisector of BA, so it's equidistant from B and A. So CA = CB. So in triangle ABC, CA = CB. But angle at A is 54 degrees. So triangle ABC is isosceles with CA = CB, and angle at A is 54 degrees. Wait, but in that case, the base angles would be equal. Wait, if CA = CB, then angles at A and B are equal. But angle at A is 54 degrees, so angle at B would also be 54 degrees, and angle at C would be 180 - 2*54 = 72 degrees. But I don't know if that helps directly.

But if CA = CB, then CB = CA = x. So in triangle ABC, we have AB = 16√2, angle at A is 54 degrees, and sides CA = CB = x. Using the Law of Sines: AB / sin(angle at C) = CA / sin(angle at B). But angle at C is 72 degrees, angle at B is 54 degrees. So AB / sin(72°) = x / sin(54°). Solving for x: x = AB * sin(54°) / sin(72°).

Let me compute this. AB is 16√2 ≈ 22.627. Sin(54°) ≈ 0.8090, sin(72°) ≈ 0.9511. So x ≈ 22.627 * 0.8090 / 0.9511 ≈ let's calculate:

First, 22.627 * 0.8090 ≈ 22.627 * 0.8 = 18.1016, plus 22.627 * 0.0090 ≈ 0.2036 → total ≈ 18.3052. Then divide by 0.9511: 18.3052 / 0.9511 ≈ 19.25. But none of the options is close to this. The options are around 18.8, 23.2, etc. Hmm, this suggests a discrepancy. Where is the error?

Wait, this assumes that CB = CA, which comes from C being on the perpendicular bisector of BA. But is this valid? Yes, because if C is on the perpendicular bisector of BA, then it's equidistant from B and A, so CA = CB. So this part is correct. 

But why is the computed value not matching any of the choices? Let me recalculate.

Let me compute AB precisely. AB is 32 / √2 = 16√2. Let's use exact values instead of approximations. 

Using exact trigonometric identities: sin(54°) = (sqrt(5)+1)/4 * 2, but perhaps better to recall that sin(54°) = cos(36°) = (sqrt(5)+1)/4 * 2. Alternatively, use exact ratios.

But perhaps it's better to calculate using calculator-like values:

sin(54°) ≈ 0.809016994

sin(72°) ≈ 0.951056516

AB = 16√2 ≈ 22.62741699

So x = AB * sin(54°) / sin(72°) ≈ 22.62741699 * 0.809016994 / 0.951056516

Calculate numerator: 22.62741699 * 0.809016994 ≈ let's compute:

22.6274 * 0.809017 ≈ 22.6274 * 0.8 = 18.10192, 22.6274 * 0.009017 ≈ 0.2041. Total ≈ 18.306.

Divide by 0.951056516: 18.306 / 0.951056516 ≈ 19.25. So approximately 19.25. None of the options are close to this. The closest is option A: 18.8. But this is still off. Why?

Wait, but maybe my assumption that triangle ABC is isosceles with CA = CB is wrong. Why? Because C is on the perpendicular bisector of BA, so it's equidistant from B and A, hence CA = CB. So this should hold. But the calculation gives x ≈ 19.25, which doesn't match any options. So where is the error?

Wait, let me check the original problem again. The given is Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,B)), 54). So angle at A between C and B is 54 degrees. So in triangle ABC, angle at A is 54 degrees. And CA = CB. So it's an isosceles triangle with CA = CB, angle at A is 54 degrees. So angle at B is also 54 degrees, angle at C is 72 degrees. Then, using Law of Sines:

AB / sin(angle C) = CA / sin(angle B)

So AB / sin(72°) = CA / sin(54°)

Thus, CA = AB * sin(54°) / sin(72°)

But AB is 32 / √2. Let me compute this expression precisely.

First, sin(54°) = cos(36°) ≈ 0.809016994

sin(72°) = cos(18°) ≈ 0.951056516

So CA = (32 / √2) * (0.809016994 / 0.951056516)

Compute 0.809016994 / 0.951056516 ≈ 0.850650808

Then CA ≈ (32 / √2) * 0.850650808

Calculate 32 / √2 ≈ 22.627417

Multiply by 0.850650808: 22.627417 * 0.850650808 ≈ let's compute:

22.627417 * 0.8 = 18.1019336

22.627417 * 0.050650808 ≈ 22.627417 * 0.05 = 1.13137085, plus 22.627417 * 0.000650808 ≈ ~0.0147. Total ≈ 1.14607.

Total CA ≈ 18.1019336 + 1.14607 ≈ 19.248. So approximately 19.25. Still not matching any options. But the closest option is A: 18.8. But this suggests that there's an error in my assumptions.

Wait, perhaps the angle at A is not in triangle ABC, but in another triangle? Let me double-check the given: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,B)), 54). So it's angle at A between C and B, which is angle CAB, so in triangle ABC. So angle at A is 54 degrees. 

But maybe there's another relation involving point D? Since D is part of the diagram. Earlier, we had triangle ABD with AB = AD = 16√2, and D is somewhere. But how does D relate to point C? The perpendicular bisector of BA is DC, so C is on that line. Also, angle at A is 54 degrees. Maybe there's another relation involving triangle ADC or something else?

Wait, since DC is the perpendicular bisector of BA, then C is on the perpendicular bisector, so AC = BC. But also, since D is connected to C, maybe there's some relationship between triangles ADC and others?

Alternatively, maybe triangle ADC is related to the isosceles triangle ABD. Let me think. Since D is part of the isosceles right triangle, and C is on the perpendicular bisector of BA, perhaps there's a way to relate AC with AD or AB.

Alternatively, perhaps using coordinates again, but with corrected assumptions. Let me try once more.

Let me set A at (0,0), B at (2m, 0), so midpoint M is at (m, 0). Let me assume DC is the perpendicular bisector, so it's the line x = m. Let me choose point D somewhere not on this line, but such that triangle ABD is right-angled and isosceles at A. Let me assume AB = AD = t. So AB is from (0,0) to (2m, 0), so AB = 2m = t → m = t/2. AD is from (0,0) to D(x, y), with length t and AD ⊥ AB. Since AB is along x-axis, AD must be vertical. So D is at (0, t). But then, the perpendicular bisector is x = m = t/2. So line DC is x = t/2. So point D is at (0, t), and point C is somewhere on x = t/2. So line DC connects (0, t) to C(t/2, k), where k is some y-coordinate. 

Now, we need to ensure that angle CAB is 54 degrees. Point C is on x = t/2, so coordinates of C are (t/2, k). So vector AC is from A(0,0) to C(t/2, k), so it has components (t/2, k). The angle between AB (vector (2m, 0) = (t, 0)) and AC (vector (t/2, k)) is 54 degrees. 

The cosine of angle between AB and AC is (AB · AC) / (|AB| |AC|). 

AB · AC = (t)(t/2) + (0)(k) = t²/2.

|AB| = t, |AC| = sqrt((t/2)^2 + k^2).

So cos(54°) = (t²/2) / (t * sqrt(t²/4 + k²)) ) = (t/2) / sqrt(t²/4 + k²).

Let me simplify:

cos(54°) = (t/2) / sqrt(t²/4 + k²)

Square both sides:

cos²(54°) = (t²/4) / (t²/4 + k²)

Multiply both sides by denominator:

cos²(54°) * (t²/4 + k²) = t²/4

Expand:

cos²(54°)*t²/4 + cos²(54°)*k² = t²/4

Rearrange:

cos²(54°)*k² = t²/4 - cos²(54°)*t²/4 = t²/4 (1 - cos²(54°)) = t²/4 * sin²(54°)

Thus:

k² = [t²/4 * sin²(54°)] / cos²(54°) = (t²/4) tan²(54°)

So k = ±(t/2) tan(54°)

So coordinates of C are (t/2, (t/2) tan(54°)) or (t/2, -(t/2) tan(54°)). Assuming it's above the x-axis, let's take positive value.

Now, we need to find AC, which is the distance from A(0,0) to C(t/2, (t/2) tan(54°)):

AC = sqrt[(t/2)^2 + ((t/2) tan(54°))^2] = (t/2) sqrt(1 + tan²(54°)) = (t/2) sec(54°)

Because 1 + tan²θ = sec²θ.

So AC = (t/2) / cos(54°)

But we know that t is AB = 32 / √2, as BD = 32 and in the isosceles right triangle, BD = t√2 = 32 → t = 32 / √2.

Substitute t = 32 / √2 into AC:

AC = (32 / √2 / 2) / cos(54°) = (16 / √2) / cos(50°)

Wait, wait: 32 / √2 divided by 2 is 16 / √2, which is 8√2. So AC = 8√2 / cos(54°)

Now, compute this value.

First, compute cos(54°):

cos(54°) ≈ 0.587785252

So AC ≈ 8√2 / 0.587785252

Calculate 8√2: 8 * 1.41421356 ≈ 11.3137085

So AC ≈ 11.3137085 / 0.587785252 ≈ let's compute this division.

Dividing 11.3137 / 0.587785 ≈ 19.248. Same as before!

So AC ≈ 19.25, which is approximately 19.3. But the closest answer
