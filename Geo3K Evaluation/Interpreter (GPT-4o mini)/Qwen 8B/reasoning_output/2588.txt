MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have several points and lines given, along with some predicates about them being parallel, perpendicular, intersecting at certain points, and there are right angles mentioned. The question is asking for the value of x where m∠3 = x - 12 and m∠6 = 72. The answer choices are A to D.

First, I need to parse all the given predicates. Let me list them again:

Lines:
- Line(A,G)
- Line(E,D)
- Line(B,F)
- Line(C,H)
- Line(A,B)

Points:
- C, H, A, B, D, E, F, G are points.

Relationships:
- Parallel(Line(A,G), Line(B,F))
- Perpendicular(Line(E,D), Line(C,H))
- IntersectAt(Line(A,G), Line(B,F), Line(C,H), Point(C)) → So lines AG and BF intersect with CH at point C?
Wait, the syntax here is confusing. The IntersectAt predicate seems to indicate that three lines intersect at a point? Or maybe two lines intersect at a point, but the third line also passes through that point?

Wait, the first one says IntersectAt(Line(A,G), Line(B,F), Line(C,H), Point(C)). That suggests that all three lines AG, BF, and CH intersect at point C. Similarly, the second IntersectAt(Line(E,D), Line(B,F), Line(C,H), Point(H)), so lines ED, BF, and CH intersect at point H.

Also, RightAngle(Angle(A,C,F)) and RightAngle(Angle(E,H,B)).

So, let me sketch mentally. Points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. Lines AG, BF, CH intersect at C. Then lines ED, BF, CH intersect at H. Also, Line(A,G) is parallel to Line(B,F). And Line(E,D) is perpendicular to Line(C,H). There are right angles at Angle(A,C,F) and Angle(E,H,B).

Now, the question refers to angles 3 and 6. But since the problem mentions angles ∠3 and ∠6, but the original problem didn't label the diagram, perhaps these angles are formed by the intersections of the lines. However, without seeing the diagram, I need to infer based on the given structure.

Let me think about the configuration. Since AG || BF, and they intersect with CH at point C and H respectively. Also, ED ⊥ CH. Also, there are right angles at ACF and EHB.

Let me consider the points. Let me note that Line(A,B) is present, as well as other lines. Let me try to imagine the setup.

Starting with Line(A,B). Points A and B are connected. Then Line(A,G) and Line(B,F) are parallel. Since AG || BF, and they intersect with CH at C and H. So point C is where AG and BF intersect CH. Wait, but if AG and BF are parallel, they cannot intersect unless they're coincident. But since they are distinct lines (since they have different endpoints), they must be parallel and not intersecting. But the predicate says they intersect with CH at point C. That suggests that AG and BF are not parallel? Wait, contradiction here. Wait, the first predicate says Parallel(Line(A,G), Line(B,F)), so they are parallel. But then how can they intersect with CH at point C? Unless CH is a transversal that intersects both AG and BF at point C? Wait, that would mean that AG and BF are both intersected by CH at the same point C. Which would imply that AG and BF are not parallel because they meet at C via CH. But that contradicts the Parallel predicate. Therefore, there must be something wrong in my interpretation.

Wait, perhaps the IntersectAt predicate is indicating that Line(A,G) and Line(B,F) intersect at point C, but also that Line(C,H) passes through that intersection point? But if AG and BF are parallel, they can't intersect. Therefore, this suggests that the initial assumption is incorrect. Maybe the IntersectAt predicate isn't saying that three lines intersect at a single point, but rather that two lines intersect at a point, and another line also passes through that point. For example, IntersectAt(Line(A,G), Line(B,F), Line(C,H), Point(C)) could mean that Line(A,G) and Line(B,F) intersect at Point C, and Line(C,H) also passes through Point C. But then, if AG and BF intersect at C, then they are not parallel, contradicting the Parallel predicate. Hence, this seems conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe the IntersectAt predicate is misinterpreted. Perhaps it's stating that Line(A,G) and Line(B,F) intersect at Point C, and Line(C,H) intersects at that same point? But again, if AG and BF are parallel, they can't intersect. Therefore, there's inconsistency here. This suggests that either my understanding of the predicates is wrong, or there's a mistake in the problem setup. Alternatively, maybe the IntersectAt predicate is referring to multiple intersections, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the user wrote:

"IntersectAt(Line(A,G), Line(B,F), Line(C,H), Point(C))"

and 

"IntersectAt(Line(E,D), Line(B,F), Line(C,H), Point(H))"

This seems like each IntersectAt takes four arguments: the first two lines, the third line, and the point where they all intersect. But that would require that all three lines intersect at the same point. However, if Line(A,G) and Line(B,F) are parallel, they can't intersect. Thus, this implies that the given predicates may have inconsistencies. Alternatively, perhaps the first IntersectAt is that Line(A,G) and Line(C,H) intersect at C, and Line(B,F) also passes through C. But then, since Line(A,G) and Line(B,F) are parallel, they can't intersect, but if both pass through C, then they would be the same line, which is not stated. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the IntersectAt predicate is meant to state that two lines intersect at a point, and the third line passes through that point. For instance, Line(A,G) and Line(B,F) intersect at Point C, and Line(C,H) passes through Point C. But then, if AG and BF are parallel, they can't intersect, hence contradiction. Therefore, this suggests that there is an error in the problem setup. But since this is a problem given to solve, likely there's a way to interpret it correctly.

Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the Parallel predicate. Let me check again: Parallel(Line(A,G), Line(B,F)). So lines AG and BF are parallel. Now, if they are parallel, then they don't intersect. But according to the first IntersectAt, they intersect at Point C. So this is impossible unless they are the same line, which they aren't. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the IntersectAt is not involving all three lines? Maybe it's that Line(A,G) intersects Line(B,F) at Point C, and Line(C,H) also intersects there. But again, if AG and BF are parallel, they can't intersect. So this is a contradiction. Therefore, there must be an error in my parsing of the predicates.

Wait, maybe the IntersectAt predicate is not indicating three lines intersecting at a single point, but rather that two lines intersect at a point, and the third line is involved in another intersection. For example, IntersectAt(Line(A,G), Line(B,F), Point(C)) means that AG and BF intersect at C, and then Line(C,H) is another line passing through C. But then, if AG and BF are parallel, they can't intersect. Hence, contradiction again.

Alternatively, maybe the first IntersectAt is that Line(A,G) and Line(C,H) intersect at Point C, and Line(B,F) also passes through Point C. In that case, Line(B,F) passes through C, but Line(A,G) and Line(C,H) intersect at C. But then, since Line(A,G) is parallel to Line(B,F), if Line(B,F) passes through C, then Line(A,G) must also pass through C, since they are parallel and both pass through C. But then, that would make Line(A,G) and Line(B,F) both pass through C, implying they are the same line if they are parallel and share a common point. But they are distinct lines (since they have different endpoints). Hence, this is still inconsistent.

Hmm, this is perplexing. Maybe there's a typo in the problem, or I'm missing something. Let me try to look at the other predicates. We have Perpendicular(Line(E,D), Line(C,H)), so ED is perpendicular to CH. Also, RightAngle(Angle(A,C,F)) and RightAngle(Angle(E,H,B)). So, angle at C between A-C-F is a right angle, and angle at H between E-H-B is a right angle.

Maybe I should focus on those right angles. Let's consider that. If Angle(A,C,F) is a right angle, then AF is perpendicular to CF. Wait, but C is a point where lines AG and BF intersect CH. Wait, if AG and BF are parallel, then point C lies somewhere... Wait, but earlier confusion remains. Let me try to re-express.

Assuming that despite the contradictions in the predicates, I should proceed with the given information. Let me try to visualize:

Given that Line(A,G) is parallel to Line(B,F). Suppose these are two parallel lines. Then, Line(C,H) intersects both of them at points C and H. Wait, but that would mean that Line(CH) is a transversal cutting both parallel lines AG and BF, creating corresponding angles. But in the first IntersectAt, it says that Line(A,G), Line(B,F), and Line(C,H) intersect at point C. So that would mean that Line(C,H) passes through point C, which is on both Line(A,G) and Line(B,F)? But if AG and BF are parallel, they can't intersect. So point C must be a point where Line(C,H) intersects Line(A,G) and Line(B,F) separately? But then, how can Line(C,H) intersect both AG and BF at the same point C? It can't unless AG and BF are the same line, which they are not.

This is very confusing. Maybe the problem has a typo, and the Parallel predicate is actually referring to different lines? Alternatively, maybe I should ignore the Parallel predicate temporarily and focus on the right angles and intersections.

Since there are right angles at Angle(A,C,F) and Angle(E,H,B), maybe those are key. Let's consider that. At point C, angle AC F is a right angle. So, lines CA and CF form a right angle. Similarly, at point H, angle EHB is a right angle, so lines HE and HB form a right angle.

Additionally, Line(E,D) is perpendicular to Line(C,H), so ED ⊥ CH.

Let me try to reconstruct the diagram step by step.

Start with Line(A,G) and Line(B,F) being parallel. Let's assume they are horizontal for simplicity. Then, Line(C,H) is a transversal intersecting them at points C and H. Wait, but if AG || BF, then the transversal CH would create corresponding angles. However, the IntersectAt predicate says that Line(A,G), Line(B,F), and Line(C,H) intersect at point C. So, if Line(C,H) intersects both AG and BF at point C, which would imply that AG and BF intersect at C, making them non-parallel, which contradicts the Parallel predicate. So, this seems impossible. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem setup, but since this is a problem to solve, I'll have to find a way around it.

Alternatively, maybe the Parallel predicate is not between AG and BF, but between other lines? Wait, the given predicates say:

Parallel(Line(A,G), Line(B,F))

Yes, that's explicit. So AG || BF.

But then, how can they intersect with CH at point C? Unless they are not straight lines? No, they are lines. So this is contradictory. Maybe the problem uses directed lines, or there's a different configuration.

Alternatively, maybe Line(A,G) and Line(B,F) are not straight lines? But the term 'Line' usually denotes straight lines in geometry.

Another possibility: Maybe the IntersectAt predicate is indicating that Line(A,G) and Line(B,F) intersect at point C, and Line(C,H) passes through C. But then, since AG and BF are parallel, they can't intersect, so this is impossible. Hence, the only way this works is if AG and BF are not parallel, but the problem states they are. Therefore, this is a paradox.

Given that, perhaps there is a mistake in the problem, but assuming that the problem is consistent, I need to reinterpret the predicates differently. Perhaps the IntersectAt predicate refers to two lines intersecting at a point, and the third line passing through that point. For example, Line(A,G) and Line(B,F) intersect at Point C, and Line(C,H) passes through C. But then, AG and BF would intersect at C, making them not parallel, which contradicts the Parallel predicate. Therefore, this is impossible.

Wait, but what if Line(C,H) is the same as Line(A,G) or Line(B,F)? For example, if Line(C,H) is Line(A,G), then it would pass through C and G. But the problem states Line(A,G), Line(B,F), Line(C,H) as separate entities. So this is unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe Line(C,H) is not a straight line but a segment? But the term 'Line' implies infinite extent.

I'm stuck here. Given that, maybe I should proceed focusing on the right angles and other given info, ignoring the conflicting parallelism.

Let me think about the right angles. Angle(A,C,F) is a right angle. So, at point C, lines CA and CF form a right angle. Similarly, Angle(E,H,B) is a right angle, so at point H, lines HE and HB form a right angle.

Also, Line(E,D) is perpendicular to Line(C,H). So ED ⊥ CH.

Let me try to draw this mentally. Assume point C is where CA and CF meet at a right angle. So, CA is one leg, CF is the other leg of the right angle. Then, Line(C,H) goes from C in some direction. Since ED is perpendicular to CH, then ED is perpendicular to that line.

Also, Line(B,F) is parallel to Line(A,G). Assuming that, even though the previous conflict remains, perhaps the rest of the relations can be used.

Let me suppose that Line(A,G) is parallel to Line(B,F). So, if I imagine two parallel lines, AG and BF. Let me place point A and G on one line, and B and F on the other. Then, Line(C,H) intersects both AG and BF at points C and H. Wait, but the IntersectAt says that all three lines intersect at C. So, if Line(C,H) intersects AG at C and BF at C, meaning that C is on both AG and BF. But if AG and BF are parallel, they can't intersect, so this is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that the problem has conflicting information, but since it's presented as solvable, I must have misread something.

Wait, maybe the IntersectAt predicate is not about three lines intersecting at one point, but about two lines intersecting at a point, and the third line being part of the intersection? Like, Line(A,G) and Line(B,F) intersect at Point C, and Line(C,H) is another line passing through C. But then, if AG and BF are parallel, they can't intersect, so this is invalid. Hence, I'm forced to conclude that there's an error in the problem setup, but since I have to solve it, I'll proceed with the given data, possibly assuming that the Parallel predicate is incorrect or misinterpreted.

Alternatively, maybe the Parallel predicate is between other lines. Let me check again: the given predicates are:

Parallel(Line(A,G), Line(B,F))

Yes, so AG || BF.

Other than that, there's Perpendicular(Line(E,D), Line(C,H)), so ED ⊥ CH.

Then, the IntersectAt predicates: 

First, Line(A,G), Line(B,F), Line(C,H) intersect at Point C.

Second, Line(E,D), Line(B,F), Line(C,H) intersect at Point H.

So, this suggests that:

- Point C is the intersection of AG, BF, and CH.

- Point H is the intersection of ED, BF, and CH.

But if AG and BF are parallel, they can't intersect, so this implies that AG and BF must intersect at C, making them non-parallel, which contradicts the Parallel predicate. Hence, this is a contradiction.

Therefore, I think there's a mistake in the problem, but since I have to proceed, perhaps I should assume that the Parallel predicate is between other lines. Let me check again the given predicates:

The user listed:

Line(A,G)

Line(E,D)

Line(B,F)

Line(C,H)

Line(A,B)

Point(C)

Point(H)

Point(A)

Point(B)

Point(D)

Point(E)

Point(F)

Point(G)

Parallel(Line(A,G), Line(B,F))

Perpendicular(Line(E,D), Line(C,H))

IntersectAt(Line(A,G), Line(B,F), Line(C,H), Point(C))

IntersectAt(Line(E,D), Line(B,F), Line(C,H), Point(H))

RightAngle(Angle(A,C,F))

RightAngle(Angle(E,H,B))

Ah! Wait, perhaps the Parallel predicate is not between Line(A,G) and Line(B,F), but between other lines? No, the user explicitly said "Parallel(Line(A,G), Line(B,F))". So that's confirmed.

Alternatively, perhaps the IntersectAt predicate is not about three lines, but about two lines intersecting at a point, and the third line being part of the intersection. For example, Line(A,G) and Line(B,F) intersect at Point C, and Line(C,H) passes through C. Similarly, Line(E,D) and Line(B,F) intersect at Point H, and Line(C,H) passes through H. But then, if AG and BF intersect at C, they are not parallel, which contradicts the Parallel predicate. Hence, again, contradiction.

Given that, perhaps the problem assumes that AG and BF are not parallel, but the Parallel predicate is a red herring or there's a typo. Alternatively, maybe it's a different pair of lines.

Alternatively, perhaps the Parallel predicate is between Line(A,G) and Line(C,H)? Let me check the original input again. The user wrote:

"Parallel(Line(A,G), Line(B,F))"

No, it's definitely between AG and BF.

At this point, I think I need to proceed by focusing on the right angles and other given relationships, ignoring the conflicting parallelism, since otherwise the problem is unsolvable. Let me try that.

Assume that Line(A,G) and Line(B,F) are not parallel, but the problem says they are. However, proceeding with the right angles.

From the RightAngle(Angle(A,C,F)), which is a right angle at point C between A-C-F. So, lines CA and CF are perpendicular.

Similarly, RightAngle(Angle(E,H,B)) is a right angle at H between E-H-B, so lines HE and HB are perpendicular.

Also, Line(E,D) is perpendicular to Line(C,H). So, ED ⊥ CH.

Let me try to construct coordinates to model this. Let me assign coordinates to the points to satisfy the conditions.

Let me set point C at (0, 0) for simplicity.

Since Angle(A,C,F) is a right angle, let's assume that CA is along the x-axis and CF is along the y-axis. So, point A is somewhere on the x-axis, say A( a, 0 ), and point F is on the y-axis, say F(0, b).

Then, Line(C,H) passes through C(0,0) and extends to some point H. Since ED is perpendicular to CH, let's assume CH has some slope, and ED has the negative reciprocal.

Also, Line(E,D) is perpendicular to CH. Let me define CH as a line through C(0,0) with slope m, so its equation is y = m x. Then, ED has slope -1/m.

Now, considering the other intersections. From the IntersectAt(Line(E,D), Line(B,F), Line(C,H), Point(H)), which suggests that Line(E,D), Line(B,F), and Line(C,H) intersect at Point H. So, Point H is on Line(C,H), Line(B,F), and Line(E,D).

Let me assume that Line(B,F) is defined by points B and F. Since F is (0, b), and Line(B,F) connects B to F. Also, Line(A,G) is parallel to Line(B,F). Let me assume that Line(A,G) is parallel to Line(B,F), so their slopes are equal.

But I need to define coordinates for all points. This is getting complex, but let's try.

Let me fix some coordinates:

Let’s set C at (0,0).

Let’s take point A at (a, 0), so CA is along x-axis.

Point F is at (0, b), so CF is along y-axis.

Now, Line(C,H) goes through C(0,0) and some point H. Let's assume H is at (h_x, h_y), lying on Line(C,H).

Since Line(E,D) is perpendicular to Line(C,H), and intersects Line(B,F) and Line(C,H) at H.

Let me assume that H is at (h_x, h_y). Since H is on Line(C,H), which is the line through C(0,0) and H(h_x, h_y), so parametric equations: x = t*h_x, y = t*h_y.

Now, Line(E,D) is perpendicular to Line(C,H). Let me denote the slope of Line(C,H) as m = h_y / h_x. Then, the slope of ED is -h_x/h_y.

Now, Line(E,D) passes through H(h_x, h_y) and has slope -h_x/h_y. Let me write its equation: y - h_y = (-h_x/h_y)(x - h_x).

Now, Line(B,F) connects points B and F(0, b). Let me denote point B as (b_x, b_y). Since Line(B,F) has to pass through H(h_x, h_y), because IntersectAt says that Line(E,D), Line(B,F), and Line(C,H) intersect at H. So, point H lies on Line(B,F). Hence, H is on Line(B,F), so it satisfies the equation of Line(B,F).

Let me express Line(B,F): it passes through B(b_x, b_y) and F(0, b). The slope of BF is (b - b_y)/(0 - b_x) = (b - b_y)/(-b_x).

Since H(h_x, h_y) is on Line(B,F), it satisfies:

(y - b) = [(b - b_y)/(-b_x)](x - 0)

=> h_y - b = [(b - b_y)/(-b_x)] h_x

=> h_y = b + [(b - b_y)/(-b_x)] h_x

= b - [(b - b_y)/b_x] h_x

Also, Line(A,G) is parallel to Line(B,F). Line(A,G) passes through A(a, 0) and G(g_x, g_y). Its slope should be equal to the slope of BF, which is [(b - b_y)/(-b_x)].

Thus, slope of AG is (g_y - 0)/(g_x - a) = g_y/(g_x - a) = [(b - b_y)/(-b_x)]

So, g_y = [(b - b_y)/(-b_x)] (g_x - a)

Now, this is getting too abstract. Maybe assigning specific coordinates would help. Let me choose specific values to simplify.

Let me assume that Line(C,H) is the y-axis. So, Line(C,H) is the y-axis, passing through C(0,0) and H(0, k) for some k. But wait, if CH is the y-axis, then ED is perpendicular to CH, so ED is horizontal (since CH is vertical). So ED is horizontal.

But then, Line(E,D) is horizontal, passing through H(0,k). So, its equation is y = k.

Now, Line(E,D) intersects Line(B,F) at H(0,k). So, Line(B,F) passes through H(0,k) and F(0,b). Wait, if F is on the y-axis (as previously assumed), then F is (0, b). So, if H is (0,k), then Line(B,F) passes through (0,k) and (0,b), so it's the vertical line x=0. But Line(A,G) is parallel to Line(B,F), which is vertical, so Line(A,G) must also be vertical. Line(A,G) passes through A(a, 0) and G(...), so if it's vertical, then A and G have the same x-coordinate. So, A is (a, 0), G is (a, g_y).

Now, Line(C,H) is the y-axis, and Line(E,D) is horizontal line y=k. Let me assume k ≠ 0.

Now, Angle(A,C,F) is a right angle. Since A is (a,0), C is (0,0), and F is (0,b). So, vectors CA = (a,0) and CF = (0,b), which are perpendicular, as expected.

Now, Line(B,F) is the vertical line x=0, passing through B and F(0,b). Since Line(B,F) is x=0, point B must be on x=0, so B is (0, b_b), where b_b is some y-coordinate. Since H is (0,k), which is on Line(B,F), then k must be between b and b_b or outside.

Now, Line(A,G) is vertical line x=a, passing through A(a,0) and G(a,g_y).

Now, the other condition is that Line(E,D) is horizontal (y=k), passing through H(0,k) and E and D.

Now, RightAngle(Angle(E,H,B)): at point H(0,k), lines HE and HB form a right angle. Since HB is from H(0,k) to B(0, b_b), which is vertical line x=0. Line HE is from H(0,k) to E. Since Line(E,D) is horizontal (y=k), point E is somewhere on y=k. Let me assume E is (e_x, k), and D is another point on y=k.

Since Line(E,D) is horizontal, and passes through H(0,k), so D is another point on y=k. Let me say D is (d_x, k).

Now, we need to find angles 3 and 6. But since the problem mentions angles 3 and 6, but without a diagram, it's challenging. However, based on standard problems, angle 3 and 6 might refer to angles formed by intersecting lines.

In this coordinate system, let's see. Let me try to identify which angles are referred to as 3 and 6.

Possibly, angle 3 is one of the angles at point C or H, or elsewhere. Given that m∠3 = x - 12 and m∠6 = 72°, and we need to find x.

Let me think about the angles formed by the intersections.

At point C(0,0), there's a right angle between CA and CF. So, that's 90 degrees. Other angles at C might involve other lines.

At point H(0,k), there's a right angle between HE and HB. Since HB is vertical, and HE is horizontal (since Line(E,D) is horizontal), so HE is horizontal, HB is vertical, forming a right angle.

Also, Line(C,H) is vertical (the y-axis), and Line(E,D) is horizontal (y=k), intersecting at H(0,k). 

Now, Line(A,G) is vertical line x=a, Line(B,F) is vertical line x=0. These are parallel, as per the given Parallel predicate. 

Now, what about angle 3 and 6? Let me think. Maybe angle 3 is at point C, and angle 6 is at point H, or vice versa. But the problem states m∠6 = 72, which is not a right angle, so it must be another angle.

Looking at the given right angles: Angle(A,C,F) is 90°, and Angle(E,H,B) is 90°. So, other angles might be formed by the intersections.

For example, at point C, since Line(C,H) is vertical (y-axis), and Line(A,G) is vertical (x=a), they are parallel, so they don't intersect. Wait, but Line(A,G) is x=a, and Line(C,H) is x=0, so they are parallel. So, they don't intersect, except if a=0, but a is the x-coordinate of point A, which is on Line(A,G). If a=0, then A would be at (0,0), which is point C. But in the problem, points A and C are distinct, since Line(A,G) and Line(C,H) intersect at C, but if A were at C, then Line(A,G) would start at C. But this is unclear.

Alternatively, maybe there are other intersections. For instance, Line(B,F) is x=0, which is vertical, and Line(C,H) is x=0, same line. So, they overlap? But then Line(C,H) and Line(B,F) are the same line, but the problem states they are distinct lines. Hence, this suggests that my assumption is wrong.

This is getting too tangled. Given the time I've spent and the complexity, I think I need to switch strategies. Since the problem involves parallel lines and right angles, and asks for x such that m∠3 = x-12 and m∠6 = 72, maybe using properties of parallel lines and transversals, or supplementary angles.

Assuming that angles 3 and 6 are related through parallel lines and transversals. For example, if two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal, alternate interior angles are equal, consecutive interior angles are supplementary.

Given that m∠6 = 72°, and m∠3 = x - 12, perhaps they are supplementary or equal.

If ∠3 and ∠6 are supplementary, then x - 12 + 72 = 180 => x = 180 - 72 + 12 = 120, which is not among the options. If they are vertical angles, then x-12 = 72 => x = 84, which is option D. Or if they are corresponding angles, same thing.

Alternatively, if ∠3 and ∠6 are part of a triangle or other figure with right angles.

Given that there are right angles at C and H, maybe ∠3 and ∠6 are complementary or supplementary to those.

For example, if ∠3 is adjacent to a right angle, then it could be 90 - 72 = 18, leading to x-12 = 18 => x=30, not in options. Or if ∠6 is part of a right triangle with ∠3.

Alternatively, since there are two right angles, maybe the sum of ∠3 and ∠6 equals 90, or something similar.

But since m∠6 = 72, and if it's part of a triangle with another angle, say, 90 - 72 = 18, then x-12 = 18 => x=30. Not matching.

Alternatively, if ∠3 and ∠6 are vertical angles, then x-12 = 72 => x=84, which is option D.

Given that the answer choices include 84, which is option D, and if assuming that ∠3 and ∠6 are vertical angles, this could be the case. But why would they be vertical angles?

Alternatively, if ∠3 and ∠6 are corresponding angles due to parallel lines, then they would be equal, so x-12 = 72 => x=84.

That fits with option D. Given that, and the presence of parallel lines (even though the earlier contradictions suggest issues), but assuming that the problem intends for us to use the parallel lines and corresponding angles, then x=84.

Hence, the answer is D.
