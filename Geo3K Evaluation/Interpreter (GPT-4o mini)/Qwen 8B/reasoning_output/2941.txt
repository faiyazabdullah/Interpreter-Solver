====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the setup. 

So, we have points A, B, C, D, F, G. There's a square named ABDC (wait, the square is ABD C? Let me check the Square(A,B,D,C) predicate. So square ABD Câ€”probably the order matters here. Squares have four sides, so the order of the points should form consecutive vertices. So maybe the square is A connected to B, B to D, D to C, and C back to A? Or maybe another order. But since it's called Square(A,B,D,C), the order is A, B, D, C forming the square. Wait, but squares have all sides equal and right angles. Also, there's a circle K mentioned, which is probably the same as Circle(A) since they mention PointLiesOnCircle for Points A, B, C, D on Circle(A). So the square is inscribed in circle K, which is centered at A? Wait, no. Wait, the Circle(A) would mean the circle has center A? Because typically, Circle(X) refers to a circle with center X. But wait, if the square is inscribed in the circle, then the circle's center would be the center of the square. However, the predicates say that Points A, B, C, D lie on Circle(A), meaning the circle is centered at point A. That seems conflicting because if the square is inscribed in the circle, the center of the circle should be the intersection point of the diagonals of the square. But according to the predicates, the square's vertices are all on a circle centered at A. So that suggests that A is the center of the circle. Therefore, the square is inscribed in a circle whose center is one of its vertices, which is unusual. Let me think about that.

Wait, the square has vertices A, B, D, C. All these points lie on Circle(A), meaning the circle is centered at A. So A is the center of the circle, and the square is inscribed in this circle. For a square inscribed in a circle, all four vertices lie on the circle, and the center of the circle is the midpoint of the square's diagonals. But if A is one of the vertices, then the diagonal from A to the opposite vertex would pass through the center. Wait, but if A is the center, then the distance from A to each vertex of the square must be equal. But in a square, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other. So if A is a vertex, and also the center, that implies that the center of the square is at A. Which is impossible unless the square is degenerate. Wait, this seems contradictory. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Let me re-examine the predicates.

Looking at the Line predicates: Line(A,C), Line(B,D), Line(C,D), Line(C,G), Line(F,A), Line(F,B), Line(F,C), Line(F,D). Also, IsCentroidOf(Point(F), Triangle(A,B,D)). So point F is the centroid of triangle ABD. Additionally, IsDiameterOf(Line(A,C), Circle(A)), and similarly for Line(B,D). So Lines AC and BD are diameters of the circle centered at A. Wait, if AC is a diameter of the circle centered at A, then the length from A to C would be twice the radius. But if A is the center, then the diameter would be a line passing through A, but that doesn't make sense because the diameter of a circle is a line segment passing through the center. Wait, perhaps the circle is not centered at A? Wait, the predicate says Circle(A), which usually denotes the circle with center A. But if AC is a diameter of the circle, then the center of the circle must be the midpoint of AC. But if the circle is supposed to be centered at A, then the diameter can't be AC because that would require the center to be halfway between A and C. This is confusing. There's a contradiction here. Let me try to resolve this.

Alternatively, perhaps the circle's name is K, but in the predicates, it's referred to as Circle(A). Maybe there was a typo, and the circle is actually named K, but the user wrote Circle(A). Alternatively, maybe the circle's center is not A, but some other point. Wait, the PointLiesOnCircle predicates indicate that Points A, B, C, D lie on Circle(A). So the circle is centered at A. Then, Line(A,C) being a diameter means that the line AC passes through the center of the circle. But the center is A, so the line AC starts at the center and goes to point C. Therefore, AC is a radius, not a diameter. Wait, but the predicate says IsDiameterOf(Line(A,C), Circle(A)). That would imply that the line AC is a diameter, meaning it passes through the center and has two endpoints on the circle. However, if the circle is centered at A, then the diameter would start at A and go through the center to another point. Wait, that's impossible because the center is already A. So this seems like a contradiction. Unless the line AC is considered as starting at A and ending at C, where C is another point on the circle. In that case, the length from A to C would be the radius. But then AC would be a radius, not a diameter. Hence, the predicate stating that Line(A,C) is a diameter of the circle contradicts the fact that the circle is centered at A. Therefore, there must be an error in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the circle is not centered at A. Maybe the circle's name is K, and the Circle(A) is a misnomer. Alternatively, perhaps the circle is centered at the midpoint of AC. Let me consider that possibility. Suppose that the circle is centered at the midpoint of AC. Then, if AC is a diameter, then the midpoint would be the center. But the predicate says PointLiesOnCircle(Point(A), Circle(A)), implying that A lies on the circle. If the circle is centered at the midpoint of AC, then A would be on the circle only if the radius equals half the length of AC. But then, if AC is a diameter, then the radius is half AC, so A would be at a distance of radius from the center. Wait, but if the center is the midpoint of AC, then the distance from the center to A is half the length of AC. So yes, A would lie on the circle. Similarly, point C would also lie on the circle. So in that case, AC is a diameter. Then, the circle is centered at the midpoint of AC, and points A and C are endpoints of the diameter. Similarly, Line(B,D) is also a diameter. So that would imply that both AC and BD are diameters of the circle, hence intersecting at the center. Since the square is inscribed in the circle, the diagonals of the square are the diameters of the circle. Therefore, the diagonals of the square are AC and BD. 

But the square is named ABD C. So the square has vertices A, B, D, C. The diagonals of a square are equal and bisect each other. So the diagonals would be AD and BC? Wait, no. Wait, in a square, the diagonals connect opposite vertices. So if the square is ABD C, the order of the vertices is such that the diagonals are connecting A to D and B to C. Wait, but the diagonals are AC and BD. Wait, if the square is ABCD arranged in order, then the diagonals are AC and BD. But in the given square, the vertices are A, B, D, C. So the square could be ordered as A, B, D, C. Let me visualize this. Let me imagine square ABD C. So starting at A, moving to B, then to D, then to C, then back to A. Wait, but that might not form a square unless the connections are correct. Let me think again. 

Alternatively, maybe the square is A, B, C, D in order, but the way it's written as Square(A,B,D,C) may indicate that the vertices are A, B, D, C in order. So the square's vertices are A, B, D, C connected in that order. Thus, the sides would be AB, BD, DC, and CA. Wait, but BD and DC would have to be perpendicular. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the square is arranged such that A and C are opposite corners, and B and D are the other two. Given that AC and BD are diameters of the circle, which are perpendicular in a square. Wait, in a square, the diagonals are perpendicular. So if AC and BD are diagonals of the square, then they are perpendicular. Also, since they are diameters of the circle, they intersect at the center of the circle. 

But earlier confusion arose about the center of the circle. If AC and BD are diameters, then their intersection point is the center of the circle. So the center is the midpoint of AC and also the midpoint of BD. Therefore, the center of the circle is the intersection point of the diagonals of the square, which is the center of the square. But according to the predicates, the circle is named Circle(A), which would suggest the center is A. But this contradicts unless A is the center. Therefore, there must be an inconsistency unless A is the center. Wait, but if the center is the midpoint of AC, then A cannot be the center unless C coincides with the center, which isn't possible. Therefore, there's a contradiction in the given predicates. Perhaps there's a mistake in interpreting the Circle(A) as having center A. Maybe the circle's name is K, and the Circle(A) is just a label for the circle, not indicating the center. Wait, but in standard notation, Circle(X) usually denotes a circle with center X. 

This seems like a critical issue. Let me try to proceed despite the confusion. Assuming that the square is inscribed in the circle, and the diagonals AC and BD are diameters. Then, the center of the circle is the midpoint of AC and BD. Let's denote the center as O. Now, since the square is inscribed in the circle, the diagonals AC and BD are diameters. In a square, the diagonals are equal and perpendicular. Therefore, angle between AC and BD is 90 degrees. 

Now, the question asks for the measure of a central angle. Central angle in a circle is formed by two radii connecting to the circumference. For example, angle AOC, where O is the center. Since AC is a diameter, the central angle subtended by AC would be 180 degrees. But that's the straight line. However, the question might refer to a different central angle. 

Alternatively, considering the square's vertices on the circle, each side of the square corresponds to arcs. Each arc between adjacent vertices would correspond to a central angle. Since the square has four sides, the total around the circle is 360 degrees, so each arc would be 360/4 = 90 degrees. Therefore, the central angle between two adjacent vertices (like A to B) would be 90 degrees. However, the question says "a central angle," so it might be referring to one of those. But the answer choices include 90 (option C), which seems likely. 

Wait, but let's verify. If the square is inscribed in the circle, then each central angle corresponding to the arc between two adjacent vertices is indeed 90 degrees. For example, the arc from A to B would be 90 degrees, as the square divides the circle into four equal parts. Therefore, the measure of a central angle would be 90 degrees. 

But let me cross-check with the given predicates. The square is ABD C, so the points are A, B, D, C. The diagonals are AC and BD, which are diameters. Therefore, the angle between two adjacent vertices, say A to B, would be 90 degrees. Hence, the central angle for arc AB is 90 degrees. Therefore, the answer would be 90, option C. 

However, another thought: if the central angle refers to the angle between two radii connecting to non-adjacent vertices, like A to B to C, but that's not a central angle. Wait, a central angle is an angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle. So for example, angle AOB, where O is the center. If the arc AB is 90 degrees, then angle AOB is 90 degrees. 

Therefore, regardless of the specific points chosen, the central angle between two adjacent vertices of the square would be 90 degrees. Hence, the answer should be 90, option C. 

Another check: the diagonals AC and BD are diameters, so they are straight lines through the center. The angle between them is 90 degrees, which is consistent with the square's diagonals being perpendicular. Therefore, the central angles corresponding to the arcs between the vertices are 90 degrees each. 

Thus, the correct answer is C.
