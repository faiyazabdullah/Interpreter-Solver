Okay, let's try to figure out how to find CD given the information. So, we have AC = x - 3, BE = 20, AB = 16, and CD = x + 5. The answer choices are A. 32, B. 35, C. 36, D. 40. 

First, I need to visualize this. Since there are points mentioned like A, B, C, D, E, it's probably some kind of geometric figure. Maybe a line segment with several points? Or perhaps a triangle with extended lines? Let me think. 

Given that AC and CD are expressions involving x, maybe they are parts of a longer segment. For example, if points A, C, D are colinear, then AD would be AC + CD. But where does BE come into play here? BE is given as 20. Maybe there's another segment or triangle involved. 

Wait, AB is given as 16. So points A and B are connected with length 16. Maybe there's a triangle ABC or something? Or perhaps a trapezoid or parallelogram? Without seeing the diagram, it's a bit challenging, but let's assume that these points form a straight line or some connected segments. 

Let me consider that maybe there's a transversal or something. Alternatively, since BE is given, perhaps there's a triangle where BE is a median or altitude? Hmm. 

Alternatively, could there be similar triangles? If so, ratios might come into play. But how do AC, BE, AB, and CD relate? 

Another thought: if AB is part of a larger structure, maybe AB is a side of a triangle, and BE is another segment. Wait, if BE is 20, maybe it's related to other sides via similar triangles or proportions. 

But since AC and CD are expressed in terms of x, and AB is 16, maybe there's a relationship between these segments. Let me think again. Suppose that points A, B, C, D are on a straight line. Then AB is between A and B, AC is from A to C, and CD is from C to D. But then where is E? 

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle where BE is a midsegment or something. Let me try to think of possible configurations. 

Suppose we have a triangle ABC, with a point E somewhere. But then BE = 20, AB = 16. Not sure yet. 

Wait, maybe the problem involves two triangles sharing a common side or something. Let me consider that there's a line segment AB with length 16. Then, maybe there are points C and D extending from it? For instance, if AC is part of AB extended? Like, if C is beyond B, making AC = AB + BC? But then AC would be 16 + BC. However, AC is given as x - 3. 

Alternatively, maybe points A, B, C, D are arranged such that AB and CD are bases of a trapezoid, and BE is a leg or diagonal? 

Alternatively, think about coordinates. Assign coordinates to points and set up equations. Let me try that approach. 

Let me assume that points A and B are on a coordinate plane. Let’s say point A is at (0, 0) and point B is at (16, 0), since AB = 16. Now, where are points C, D, and E? 

If AC = x - 3, then point C could be somewhere. But without knowing direction, it's hard. Maybe if C is along AB extended? Suppose C is on the extension of AB beyond B. Then AC would be AB + BC. So AC = AB + BC → x - 3 = 16 + BC → BC = x - 3 -16 = x -19. But then CD is x +5. If D is further along the same line, then CD would be BD - BC? Not sure. 

Alternatively, if E is a different point. Given BE = 20, maybe E is on another line. Maybe there's a triangle where BE is a side. 

Wait, maybe there's a triangle with BE as a median or altitude. For example, if BE is a median in triangle ABC, then E would be the midpoint of AC. But then BE would relate to the sides. But we don't know if that's the case. 

Alternatively, think about the problem being about similar triangles. Suppose there are two similar triangles where corresponding sides are proportional. For example, if AC corresponds to BE, and AB corresponds to something else. 

Wait, given that AC = x - 3, BE = 20, AB = 16, CD = x +5. Maybe the triangles are similar, leading to proportionality. Let me try setting up a ratio. 

Assume that triangle ABC is similar to triangle DBE or something. For example, if angle at B is shared, and sides around it are proportional. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, this is speculative. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about a transversal cutting across parallel lines, creating proportional segments. For instance, if AB and CD are parallel, and a transversal intersects them, creating segments with certain ratios. 

Wait, but BE is given. If BE is a transversal, then maybe there's a proportion involving AB and CD. 

Alternatively, think of the problem as having two segments: one with AC and CD, and another with BE. Maybe there's a relation between them through some geometric property. 

Wait, here's an idea: suppose that points A, B, C, D are on a straight line, and E is another point forming a triangle or something. Let me try that. 

Assume that A---B---C---D are colinear, with AB = 16, AC = x - 3, CD = x +5. Then AC = AB + BC, so x - 3 = 16 + BC → BC = x - 19. Also, CD = x +5. If the entire length from A to D is AC + CD = (x - 3) + (x +5) = 2x +2. But also, AD can be expressed as AB + BC + CD? Wait, no. If the order is A---B---C---D, then AD = AB + BC + CD? No, wait. If A to B is 16, B to C is BC, and C to D is CD. So total AD = AB + BC + CD? No, because from A to D is AB + BC + CD only if B is between A and C, and C is between B and D. Wait, if the order is A, B, C, D, then AD = AB + BC + CD? No, AD would be AB + BC + CD only if each segment is added sequentially. Wait, actually, AB is from A to B, BC is from B to C, and CD is from C to D. So the total length from A to D is AB + BC + CD. But AC is from A to C, which is AB + BC. Therefore, AC = AB + BC → x -3 = 16 + BC → BC = x - 19. And CD is x +5. But how does BE factor into this? Where is E?

Ah! Maybe E is another point related to this line. For example, if BE is a segment from B to E, where E is on CD or something. But without more info, it's unclear. 

Wait, maybe there's a triangle involving BE. Suppose that BE connects B to E, which is on CD. If BE is perpendicular to CD, or forms some triangle. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle where BE is a midline. For instance, if E is the midpoint of CD, then BE would be a midline, but BE is given as 20. 

Alternatively, think of vectors or coordinate geometry. Let me try assigning coordinates again. Let me place point A at (0,0), point B at (16,0). Suppose that point C is somewhere. If AC = x - 3, then coordinates of C depend on direction. But without knowing direction, it's tricky. 

Wait, maybe there's a right triangle involved. For example, if BE is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs AB and something else. But BE is 20, AB is 16. So if AB and AE were legs, then BE^2 = AB^2 + AE^2. So 20² = 16² + AE² → AE² = 400 - 256 = 144 → AE = 12. Then AE = 12. If AE is related to other segments... 

But how does this connect to AC and CD? Maybe AE is part of AC or something. For example, if E is on AC, then AE + EC = AC. But if AE = 12 and AC = x -3, then EC = x -3 -12 = x -15. But then how does CD fit in? 

Alternatively, if E is a point such that BE is connected to CD. This seems too vague. 

Wait, maybe the problem is about the Midpoint Theorem or something. Suppose that BE is a midline in a triangle, so it's half the length of the base. If BE = 20, then the base would be 40. But AB is 16. Not sure. 

Alternatively, think about the problem as having two segments: AC and CD, which are related through x, and BE is another segment that relates to AB. 

Wait, maybe there's a system of equations here. Let me see. We have AC = x -3, CD = x +5. If these are parts of a single line, then maybe the total length from A to D is AC + CD = (x -3) + (x +5) = 2x +2. But if AB is 16, maybe AB is part of this? Like, if AB is a segment from A to B, and then B to C or something. 

Alternatively, suppose that AB and CD are two sides of a trapezoid, and BE is a diagonal. But without knowing the type of trapezoid, it's hard to tell. 

Wait, maybe the problem is missing some context, like a diagram showing points arranged in a particular way. Since the user mentioned a diagram, but didn't provide it, I have to make assumptions. 

Another possibility: maybe the problem involves intersecting lines or something. For example, if two lines intersect, creating vertical angles, and BE is one of the segments. 

Alternatively, think of the problem as involving similar triangles where AC corresponds to BE, and AB corresponds to CD. Let me try setting up a proportion. If triangles are similar, then AC / BE = AB / CD. Let me check: 

AC / BE = AB / CD → (x -3)/20 = 16/(x +5). Cross-multiplying: (x -3)(x +5) = 20*16 → x² +5x -3x -15 = 320 → x² +2x -15 = 320 → x² +2x -335 = 0. Solving quadratic equation: x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 1340)] / 2 → sqrt(1344) ≈ 36.66. So x ≈ (-2 + 36.66)/2 ≈ 34.66/2 ≈ 17.33. Then CD = x +5 ≈ 22.33. But none of the options are close to that. So maybe my assumption about similarity is wrong. 

Alternatively, maybe AC / AB = CD / BE? Let's try that. (x -3)/16 = (x +5)/20 → cross multiply: 20(x -3) = 16(x +5) → 20x -60 = 16x +80 → 4x = 140 → x=35. Then CD = x+5 = 40. Which is option D. But why would AC / AB = CD / BE? That would require some geometric justification. 

If there's a triangle where AC and CD are corresponding sides, and AB and BE are others, maybe through similar triangles. For example, if there are two similar triangles with sides AC ~ BE and AB ~ CD. But how? 

Alternatively, think of a triangle where AB and BE are parts of the triangle, and AC and CD are other parts. For instance, if AB and CD are parallel, and AC and BE are transversals. In that case, the triangles formed might be similar. 

For example, if AB is parallel to CD, and a transversal cuts them, creating similar triangles. Let me imagine two parallel lines AB and CD, with a transversal AC intersecting them at A and C. Another transversal BE intersecting at B and E. If those transversals are parallel, but not sure. 

Alternatively, think of a triangle ABC with a line DE parallel to BC, creating similar triangles. But then BE might be a segment inside. 

Wait, if AB is parallel to CD, and BE is a transversal, then maybe the triangles ABE and CDE are similar. If that's the case, then AB/CD = BE/CE. But I don't know CE. 

Alternatively, if there's a triangle where AB and CD are corresponding sides, and BE is another side. 

But going back, assuming that AC / AB = CD / BE led us to x=35, giving CD=40, which is option D. But why would that proportion hold? It requires that the triangles are similar. Maybe there's a reason for that proportion. 

Since the answer options include 40, and the calculation gives that, maybe that's the intended path. Even though I'm not entirely sure about the geometric justification, the math checks out if we assume that proportion. 

So, if we take AC / AB = CD / BE, then solving gives x=35, hence CD = 35 +5=40. Which is option D. 

Therefore, the answer is D.
