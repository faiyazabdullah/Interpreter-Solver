<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, we have a parallelogram, and some given lengths. The question is asking for the value of 'a'. Let me start by recalling what a parallelogram is. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in length and parallel. Also, the diagonals bisect each other. But I need to see how the given predicates fit into this.

First, let me list out all the given information. The predicates mention points W, X, Y, Z, A. There are lines: WX, YZ, XZ, YA. The lengths are given as follows:

- Length of WX is 10.
- Length of YZ is 2.
- Length of XZ is a - 7.
- Length of YA is 2b - 6.

But since it's a parallelogram, maybe there are some relationships between these sides. Wait, but first, I need to visualize or sketch the diagram. However, without knowing exactly how the points are connected, I might need to infer based on standard parallelogram properties.

In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. So if WX and YZ are opposite sides, then they should be equal. But wait, according to the given, WX is 10 and YZ is 2. That would mean 10 = 2? That doesn't make sense. Hmm, so maybe my assumption about which sides are opposite is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the sides aren't directly WX and YZ but involve different connections.

Wait, the lines mentioned are WX, YZ, XZ, YA. Let me think about the structure. Points W, X, Y, Z, A. Since it's a parallelogram, maybe the vertices are W, X, Y, Z arranged such that sides are WX, XY, YZ, and ZW. But then where does point A come into play?

Alternatively, maybe the parallelogram has points W, X, Y, Z, with A being another point connected via line YA. But the presence of point A complicates things. Let me consider that in a parallelogram, diagonals connect opposite corners. For example, if the parallelogram is WXYZ, then the diagonals would be WY and XZ. Wait, but here we have line XZ given as length a-7. If XZ is a diagonal, then maybe its length relates to the sides?

But also, there's line YA with length 2b -6. So point A is connected to Y. Maybe A is a midpoint or something? Or perhaps A is part of another side?

Alternatively, maybe the parallelogram isn't WXYZ, but involves point A. Let me think again. The lines given are WX, YZ, XZ, YA. So points involved are W, X, Y, Z, A. So maybe the parallelogram is made up of parts of these lines. For instance, if W and X are two adjacent vertices, and Y and Z are others. But I'm getting confused without seeing the actual figure.

Let me try to use the properties of a parallelogram. Suppose that in the parallelogram, sides WX and YZ are opposite. Then their lengths should be equal. But according to the given, WX is 10 and YZ is 2. That's conflicting unless there's a miscalculation. Therefore, maybe those lines are not opposite sides but something else. Perhaps the lines WX and YZ are not sides but diagonals or other elements.

Wait, in a parallelogram, the diagonals are not necessarily equal unless it's a rectangle. But if one diagonal is XZ (given as a-7) and another could be WA or something else? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the lines WX and YZ are sides, and XZ is a diagonal. Let's assume that. So, suppose WXYZ is a parallelogram. Then sides WX and YZ are opposite, so their lengths should be equal. But according to the given, WX=10 and YZ=2. That contradicts unless... unless there's a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, maybe the lines WX and YZ are not sides but other segments. For example, if the parallelogram is WXYZ, then the sides are WX, XY, YZ, ZW. So the diagonals would be WY and XZ. So the length of diagonal XZ is given as a-7. Then, if we can relate the diagonals to the sides.

But in a parallelogram, the sum of squares of the diagonals equals twice the sum of squares of the sides. The formula is: 2(WX² + XY²) = XZ² + WY². But I don't know the other diagonal's length. Unless there's more info.

Alternatively, maybe the lines mentioned are not the entire sides but parts of them. For example, line XZ might be a diagonal, and line YA is another segment. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's tricky.

Wait, the problem mentions that it's a parallelogram, so maybe some of these lines are sides and some are diagonals. Let me try to find relations between the given lengths.

We have:

- Length(WX) = 10
- Length(YZ) = 2
- Length(XZ) = a - 7
- Length(YA) = 2b -6

Since it's a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. So if WX and YZ are opposite sides, they should be equal. But 10 ≠ 2. Hence, this suggests that WX and YZ are not opposite sides. So maybe WX and YZ are adjacent sides? Wait, in a parallelogram, adjacent sides are not equal unless it's a rhombus.

Alternatively, maybe the lines WX and YZ are not sides but something else. Let me think of the possibility that XZ is a diagonal. Suppose that in parallelogram WXYZ, the diagonals are XZ and WY. Then, if XZ is given as a-7, and if we can express it in terms of the sides.

But without knowing the other diagonal's length, maybe we can't proceed. However, we also have line YA with length 2b -6. Where is point A located? It's connected to Y via line YA. Maybe point A is the intersection of diagonals? In a parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other, so the midpoint of XZ is the same as the midpoint of WY. But if A is the midpoint of WY, then YA would be half of WY. But I don't know the length of WY.

Alternatively, maybe point A is another vertex? But the points listed are W, X, Y, Z, A. If it's a parallelogram, usually four points. So maybe A is a typo, or maybe it's part of another element.

Alternatively, maybe the parallelogram is WXYZ, and point A is somewhere on one of the sides. For instance, if YA is a segment from Y to A, which lies on another side. For example, if A is on side WX, then YA would be a transversal.

This seems too vague. Let me think differently. Since there are variables a and b, and we're asked to find a, maybe there's a relationship between the given lengths that allows us to set up equations involving a and b, and then solve for a. 

Given that there's a parallelogram, maybe certain sides are equal. For example, if WX and YZ are opposite sides, then their lengths should be equal. But given that WX is 10 and YZ is 2, this can't be. So maybe they are adjacent sides? Then the sides would be WX and XY, but then YZ would be another side. This is confusing.

Wait, let's try to consider that in the parallelogram, sides WX and XZ are adjacent? No, because XZ is a diagonal, not a side. 

Alternatively, maybe the lines given are not sides but parts of the parallelogram. For instance, if WX is one side, XZ is a diagonal, and YZ is another side. Let me attempt to imagine that.

Assume WXYZ is a parallelogram. Then, sides are WX, XY, YZ, ZW. Diagonals are XZ and WY. So, if we have line XZ (diagonal) with length a-7. Also, line YZ is a side with length 2. And line WX is another side with length 10. So in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal, so WX = YZ? Wait, that would mean 10 = 2, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that either my assumption about which lines are sides is incorrect, or there's another configuration.

Alternatively, maybe the lines WX and YZ are not sides but diagonals. Suppose that in the parallelogram, the diagonals are WX and YZ. Then their lengths would be equal? No, in a general parallelogram, diagonals are not equal unless it's a rectangle. So if WX is one diagonal with length 10 and YZ is another with length 2, that would imply it's not a rectangle, but then how do the sides relate?

Alternatively, maybe the lines WX and YZ are not diagonals but something else. Let's think again. The problem says "in the given parallelogram," so maybe the lines WX, YZ, XZ, YA are all within the parallelogram. Let me try to think of the parallelogram having vertices W, X, Y, Z, with A being another point. 

Suppose the parallelogram is WXYZ, with points W, X, Y, Z. Then, lines WX, XY, YZ, ZW are the sides. Now, line XZ would be a diagonal connecting X to Z. Line YA would be from Y to A. But where is point A? If A is a point on one of the sides or another location. 

If YA is a segment from Y to A, and assuming that A is on side WZ or something, then maybe YA is a median or something. But without more info, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, perhaps A is the fourth vertex of another parallelogram? Not sure. 

Wait, maybe the key lies in the fact that in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. So, if XZ is a diagonal, then its midpoint is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal. But if we can relate that to line YA, which connects Y to A. If A is the midpoint of the other diagonal, then YA would be half of that diagonal. 

For example, suppose that the diagonals are XZ and WY. Their midpoints coincide. So, if we take the midpoint of XZ, which is point M, then M is also the midpoint of WY. If point A is the midpoint of WY, then YA would be the distance from Y to M. 

So, if that's the case, then YA would be half of WY. Let me denote the length of WY as some value. But we don't have direct info on that. However, maybe we can relate it through the properties of the parallelogram.

Also, in a parallelogram, the sum of the squares of the diagonals equals twice the sum of the squares of the sides. So, if we denote d1 as XZ (which is a-7), and d2 as WY, then:

d1² + d2² = 2(a² + b²), where a and b are the lengths of the sides. Wait, no, the sides would be WX and XY, for example. Wait, the formula is 2*(side1² + side2²) = d1² + d2².

But in our case, we know the length of WX is 10. If WX is one side, say side1, then side1 is 10. What about side2? Well, if YZ is another side, but earlier we saw that YZ is 2. But if YZ is a side, then side2 is 2. But in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. So if WX and YZ are opposite sides, they should be equal. But 10 vs 2 contradicts. Hence, this suggests that YZ is not a side but perhaps something else.

Wait, but maybe YZ is a diagonal? If YZ is a diagonal, then its length is 2. But then, if XZ is another diagonal with length a-7. Then applying the formula:

d1² + d2² = 2*(side1² + side2²). 

But we don't know the sides. However, if we assume that the sides are WX and XY, for example. But without knowing which lines correspond to the sides, it's challenging.

Alternatively, maybe the lines WX and YZ are sides, but since they are unequal, they must be adjacent sides. Then, in a parallelogram, adjacent sides are not necessarily equal. So, if WX is 10 and YZ is 2, then those would be adjacent sides. Then, the other sides would be equal to those. So, for example, if WX is one side (say AB) and YZ is another side (BC), then the other sides would be equal to WX and YZ respectively. But then, how does XZ fit into this?

Line XZ is given as length a-7. If XZ is a diagonal, then in terms of the sides, the length of the diagonal can be found using the law of cosines. For example, in a parallelogram, the length of the diagonal can be calculated if we know the sides and the angle between them.

But without knowing the angle, this might not help directly. However, if we can relate this to other information.

Additionally, there's line YA with length 2b-6. Assuming point A is related to the parallelogram somehow. If A is the intersection point of the diagonals, then YA would be half of the diagonal WY. Because in a parallelogram, diagonals bisect each other. So if A is the midpoint of diagonal WY, then YA would be half of WY. 

Let me formalize this. Suppose the diagonals are XZ and WY, intersecting at point A. Then, A is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, the length of YA would be half the length of WY. Let me denote the length of WY as 2k, so YA = k. Therefore, 2b -6 = k. 

Now, using the formula for the diagonals in a parallelogram:

d1² + d2² = 2(s1² + s2²)

Where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals, and s1 and s2 are the lengths of the sides.

In this scenario, d1 is XZ = a-7, and d2 is WY = 2k = 2*(2b-6) = 4b -12. Wait, no. If YA is half of WY, then WY = 2*YA = 2*(2b-6) = 4b -12. So d2 = 4b -12.

Now, the sides s1 and s2 are the lengths of the sides of the parallelogram. Which ones are they? If WX and YZ are the sides, then s1 = 10 and s2 = 2. But earlier, this led to inconsistency in the diagonal calculation. Let me check.

Using the formula:

(a-7)^2 + (4b-12)^2 = 2*(10^2 + 2^2)  
=> (a-7)^2 + (4b-12)^2 = 2*(100 + 4) = 2*104 = 208

But this equation has two variables, a and b. We need another equation to solve for a. Where can we get another relation?

Looking back, maybe there's another way to relate a and b. For example, if we consider the other diagonal. Wait, but we only have one equation so far. Is there another condition?

Alternatively, perhaps the sides WX and YZ are not the sides of the parallelogram but something else. Wait, if WX is a side (length 10), and YZ is another side (length 2), then they are adjacent sides. But in that case, the diagonals can be computed using the formula:

d1 = sqrt(s1² + s2² + 2*s1*s2*cos(theta))  
d2 = sqrt(s1² + s2² - 2*s1*s2*cos(theta))

Where theta is the angle between the sides. But without knowing theta, we can't compute numerical values. However, if there's another relation involving the diagonals, like the other diagonal's length, but we don't have that.

Wait, but we have line XZ (one diagonal) as a-7 and line YA (half of the other diagonal) as 2b-6. So if we can express the other diagonal in terms of b, and plug into the formula. 

But without knowing the angle theta, it's still two variables. So maybe there's another relation. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the other diagonal can be expressed in terms of the sides and the given data. For example, if the diagonals are XZ and WY, and we have their expressions in terms of a and b, then combining with the formula for the sum of squares of diagonals.

But we need to link a and b. Is there another piece of information?

Wait, the problem states that it's a parallelogram. Are there any constraints on the lengths of the diagonals relative to the sides? For example, in a parallelogram, the sum of the lengths of the diagonals must be greater than the sum of the lengths of the sides? Not sure. But that might not help directly.

Alternatively, maybe there's a property that links the diagonals with the sides. For instance, if the diagonals are perpendicular, then it's a rhombus, but that's not necessarily the case here.

Hmm, this seems stuck. Let me re-examine the problem. The question asks for 'a', so maybe there's a way to eliminate 'b' by finding another equation.

Wait, maybe the length of YA is related to the sides. If YA is half of the other diagonal, which is WY. But we also have that the other diagonal, WY, can be related to the sides via the formula. 

Let me write down the equation again:

(a-7)^2 + (4b -12)^2 = 2*(10^2 + 2^2) = 208

So (a-7)^2 + (4b-12)^2 = 208.

But this equation alone cannot solve for a without knowing b. So there must be another equation linking a and b.

Wait, maybe there's another relationship from the parallelogram. For example, the difference between the diagonals or something else?

Alternatively, maybe the line YA is not half of the diagonal, but something else. Like, if point A is not the midpoint of the diagonal but another point. 

Alternatively, perhaps point A is such that YA is a side? For example, if YA is a side of the parallelogram. But then, since it's a parallelogram, YA would be equal to another side. But we already have sides WX=10 and YZ=2. So if YA is a side, then 2b-6 must be equal to one of these. 

For instance, if YA is equal to WX (10), then 2b-6 = 10 => 2b = 16 => b=8. Alternatively, if YA is equal to YZ (2), then 2b-6=2 => 2b=8 => b=4. But how do we know which one it is?

But why would YA be a side? Without knowing the configuration, it's uncertain. But if we assume that, maybe we can proceed.

Let me explore both possibilities.

Case 1: YA is a side equal to WX (10). Then 2b-6=10 → b=8. Then, substituting back into the previous equation:

(a-7)^2 + (4b-12)^2 = 208  
With b=8, 4b-12 = 32-12=20. So:

(a-7)^2 + (20)^2 = 208  
→ (a-7)^2 + 400 = 208  
→ (a-7)^2 = -192 → Impossible. So this case invalid.

Case 2: YA is a side equal to YZ (2). Then 2b-6=2 → 2b=8 → b=4. Substituting into the equation:

(a-7)^2 + (4*4 -12)^2 = (a-7)^2 + (16-12)^2 = (a-7)^2 + 16 = 208  
→ (a-7)^2 = 192 → a-7 = ±√192 ≈ ±13.85, which is not integer. The answer choices are integers (2,8,9,10), so this suggests this is also invalid. So neither case works. Hence, my assumption that YA is a side is likely wrong.

Back to square one. Let me think again. Perhaps YA is not related to the diagonals but to another aspect. For example, if A is a point on one of the sides, creating a segment YA whose length is given.

Alternatively, maybe the parallelogram has points W, X, Y, Z, and A is a point such that YA is part of a triangle or something. For instance, if triangle XYZ has YA as a median or altitude. But without more details, it's hard to say.

Wait, another idea: since the problem mentions "the given parallelogram," maybe the lines WX, YZ, XZ, YA are all sides or diagonals. Let me count the number of points. There are five points: W, X, Y, Z, A. In a parallelogram, typically four points. So maybe A is the intersection point of the diagonals. In that case, the diagonals are XZ and WY, intersecting at A. So, point A is the midpoint of both diagonals. 

If that's the case, then YA would be the length from Y to the midpoint of diagonal WY. Since A is the midpoint of WY, YA would be half of WY. So, if WY has length 2m, then YA = m. Given that YA is 2b-6, then m = 2b-6. Thus, the full diagonal WY is 4b-12.

Then, using the formula for the sum of squares of diagonals:

XZ² + WY² = 2*(WX² + YZ²)  
Wait, but earlier I thought that was for the sum of the squares of the diagonals. Let me confirm: Yes, in a parallelogram, the sum of the squares of the diagonals equals twice the sum of the squares of the sides. So:

d1² + d2² = 2(s1² + s2²)

Here, d1 is XZ (a-7), d2 is WY (4b-12), and s1 and s2 are the lengths of the sides. But which sides are s1 and s2? If WX and YZ are the sides, then s1 = 10 and s2 = 2. Plugging into the equation:

(a-7)^2 + (4b-12)^2 = 2*(10^2 + 2^2) = 2*(100+4)= 208.

Again, this gives us one equation with two variables. Need another relation.

Wait, but maybe the sides are not WX and YZ but something else. For example, if WX and XZ are sides? No, XZ is a diagonal. Or if WX and XY are sides, and YZ is another side. But without knowing which lines are the sides, it's unclear.

Alternatively, maybe the sides are WX and XY, and YZ is a diagonal. Let me try that. If YZ is a diagonal, then its length is 2. So, using the formula:

d1² + d2² = 2*(s1² + s2²)

Here, d1 could be XZ (a-7), d2 is YZ (2). So:

(a-7)^2 + 2^2 = 2*(s1^2 + s2^2)

But we need to identify s1 and s2. If s1 and s2 are the sides, which would be WX and XY. But we only know WX is 10. How to find XY?

Wait, if XZ is a diagonal, then in a parallelogram, the diagonals split the parallelogram into triangles. Using the law of cosines, the length of the diagonal can be expressed in terms of the sides and the angle between them.

But again, without knowing the angle, this might not help. However, if we assume that the parallelogram is a rectangle, then the diagonals are equal. But since YZ is 2 and XZ is a-7, that would require a-7 = 2 → a=9. But is that valid?

Wait, if it were a rectangle, then all angles are 90 degrees, and the diagonals are equal. So, if YZ is a diagonal (length 2) and XZ is another diagonal (length a-7), then a-7 would equal 2 → a=9. This would give us a candidate for answer C. But why would YZ be a diagonal?

Earlier, I assumed that YZ is a diagonal. But if that's the case, then the sides would be WX and XY. But how to verify?

Alternatively, maybe the given lines are not the sides and diagonals but something else. Let me think: if the parallelogram has sides WX and YZ, but they are not opposite. Wait, in a parallelogram, opposite sides are parallel and equal. So, if WX and YZ are opposite sides, they should be equal. But given that WX=10 and YZ=2, this is impossible. Hence, this implies that WX and YZ are adjacent sides. So, in that case, the sides are WX=10 and YZ=2. Then, the other sides would be equal to these. So, for example, if the parallelogram is WXYZ, then sides WX=10, XY=?, YZ=2, ZW=?. Wait, but in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. So, if WX and YZ are opposite, they should be equal, which they aren't. Hence, contradiction. So this suggests that WX and YZ are not opposite sides.

Therefore, perhaps WX and YZ are adjacent sides. Let's say, for example, that the sides are WX=10 and XY=2. Then, the other sides would be YZ=10 and ZW=2. But then, the diagonals would be XZ and WY. 

Now, if XZ is a diagonal with length a-7, and we can calculate it using the formula for the diagonal in terms of the sides and the angle between them. But again, without knowing the angle, it's difficult. 

However, if we assume that the parallelogram is a rectangle, then the diagonals are equal and the angle between sides is 90 degrees. In that case, the length of the diagonal would be sqrt(10² + 2²) = sqrt(104). So, if XZ is a diagonal, then a-7 = sqrt(104) ≈ 10.198. But none of the answer choices are close to this. So this suggests it's not a rectangle.

Alternatively, maybe the parallelogram is a rhombus, but that requires all sides equal, which isn't the case here.

Another approach: since there's a variable 'a' and 'b', and the answer choices are integers, maybe there's a way to find a relationship between a and b using the given lengths and the properties of the parallelogram.

Let me go back to the equation I had earlier:

(a-7)^2 + (4b-12)^2 = 208.

And if I can find another equation relating a and b. Where could that come from?

Maybe from the length of YA. If YA is related to the sides. For example, if YA is a height or something. But without knowing the configuration, it's hard to say.

Wait, what if YA is a side? Earlier, this didn't work, but maybe I made a mistake.

Assuming YA is a side of the parallelogram. Then, since it's a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. So if YA is one side, then another side would be equal to it. But we already have WX=10 and YZ=2. So, if YA is a side, it must be equal to one of these. 

Case 1: YA = WX = 10 → 2b-6 = 10 → b=8. Then, plugging into the earlier equation:

(a-7)^2 + (4*8 -12)^2 = (a-7)^2 + (32-12)^2 = (a-7)^2 + 400 = 208 → (a-7)^2 = -192 → invalid.

Case 2: YA = YZ = 2 → 2b-6 = 2 → b=4. Then:

(a-7)^2 + (4*4 -12)^2 = (a-7)^2 + (16-12)^2 = (a-7)^2 + 16 = 208 → (a-7)^2 = 192 → a-7 = sqrt(192) ≈ 13.85. Not matching answer choices.

No good. So this suggests that YA is not a side. 

Alternative idea: Maybe YA is the height of the parallelogram. If so, then the area would be base times height. But we don't know the area. However, if we could express it in terms of the sides and the height. But again, without knowing the angle or other information, it's unclear.

Wait, but maybe we can relate the diagonals and the heights. Not sure.

Alternatively, think about vector approaches. In a parallelogram, vectors representing the sides add up. But this may be overcomplicating.

Another observation: The answer choices are A.2, B.8, C.9, D.10. Let's test these values for 'a' and see if they satisfy the equation with some plausible 'b'.

Take option C: a=9. Then, a-7 = 2. So, substitute into the equation:

(2)^2 + (4b-12)^2 = 208  
→ 4 + (4b-12)^2 = 208  
→ (4b-12)^2 = 204  
→ 4b-12 = ±sqrt(204) ≈ ±14.28. So 4b = 12 ±14.28 → b=(12+14.28)/4 ≈ 6.57 or (12-14.28)/4 ≈ -0.57. Not nice numbers, but maybe possible? But not sure.

Option B: a=8 → a-7=1. So:

1^2 + (4b-12)^2 = 208 → 1 + (4b-12)^2 = 208 → (4b-12)^2 = 207 → 4b-12 = ±sqrt(207) ≈ ±14.38. Again, not helpful.

Option D: a=10 → a-7=3. So:

3^2 + (4b-12)^2 = 9 + (4b-12)^2 = 208 → (4b-12)^2 = 199 → same issue.

Option A: a=2 → a-7=-5 → (-5)^2 =25 → 25 + (4b-12)^2 = 208 → (4b-12)^2 = 183 → again no.

None of these give whole numbers for b. So this suggests that my initial assumption about the formula might be wrong. Maybe the formula for the sum of diagonals squared is not applicable here? Or perhaps I've misapplied it.

Wait, let me double-check the formula for the sum of squares of diagonals in a parallelogram. Yes, it's correct: d1² + d2² = 2(s1² + s2²). So if that's the case, then my equation is correct. But since none of the answer choices lead to a valid b, maybe my assumptions about which lines are the diagonals and sides are wrong.

Let me reconsider the configuration. Maybe XZ is not a diagonal but a side. Let's say, for example, that the parallelogram has sides WX, XZ, ZY, and YW. Wait, but that would make it a rhombus if all sides are equal, but here WX=10, XZ=a-7, etc. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the lines given are not the diagonals or sides but other elements. For example, if the parallelogram is WXYZ, and line XZ is a side, and line YA is another segment. 

Wait, let's think differently. Since the problem mentions a parallelogram, and includes points W, X, Y, Z, A. Let me try to assign coordinates to these points to derive equations.

Let me place point W at (0, 0). Since it's a parallelogram, let's define the coordinates. Let's say vector WX is along the x-axis. So, point X is at (10, 0) because WX=10.

Now, since it's a parallelogram, vector WZ should be equal to vector XY. Let me denote point Z as (p, q), so vector WZ is (p, q). Then, point Y would be X + vector WZ, so Y = (10 + p, 0 + q).

Now, the length of YZ is 2. Point Y is (10+p, q), point Z is (p, q). So, the vector YZ is (p - (10+p), q - q) = (-10, 0). Wait, that means the length of YZ is 10, but the given is 2. Contradiction. So this suggests that my coordinate assignment is wrong.

Ah! Wait, the length of YZ is given as 2. So in this setup, YZ is horizontal, length 10, which conflicts with given 2. Hence, my assumption about the placement is incorrect.

Maybe I need to adjust the coordinates. Let me try again. Let me assume that the sides WX and WZ are vectors. Let me denote:

Point W at (0, 0). 
Vector WX is (10, 0), so point X is at (10, 0).
Vector WZ is (a, b), so point Z is at (a, b).
Then, point Y is X + WZ = (10+a, 0+b) = (10+a, b).

Now, the length of YZ is the distance between Y (10+a, b) and Z (a, b). This is |(10+a - a, b - b)| = (10, 0). So length YZ is 10, but given it's 2. Conflict again. So this suggests that my choice of vectors is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the sides are WX and WZ, but the length of YZ is not a side but another segment. Let me calculate YZ in this setup. Y is (10+a, b), Z is (a, b). So YZ is horizontal, length 10, as before. So this can't be. Hence, my coordinate system is flawed.

Perhaps the error is in assuming that WX and WZ are the sides. Maybe instead, the sides are WX and XY, with YZ being a diagonal. Let me try this.

Let me redefine: Let W be (0, 0), X be (10, 0). Let vector WX be (10, 0). Let vector XY be (p, q), so point Y is (10 + p, q). Since it's a parallelogram, vector WZ must equal vector XY. So point Z is (p, q). Then, point Z is (p, q). Now, the length of YZ is the distance between Y (10+p, q) and Z (p, q), which is sqrt((10+p - p)^2 + (q - q)^2) = sqrt(10² + 0) = 10. Again, conflict with given YZ=2.

This suggests that regardless of how I set up the coordinates, if YZ is supposed to be 2, then my setup is wrong. Hence, perhaps YZ is not a side but a diagonal. Let me try that.

Assume that YZ is a diagonal. So in the parallelogram WXYZ, the diagonals are XZ and WY. So, if YZ is a diagonal, then it must be one of them. Let's say YZ is diagonal WY. Then, its length is 2. So, the diagonal WY has length 2.

In this case, the other diagonal is XZ, with length a-7. Using the formula:

d1² + d2² = 2(s1² + s2²)

Where d1 = 2, d2 = a-7, and s1 and s2 are the sides.

But what are s1 and s2? They are the lengths of the sides of the parallelogram. Let's say, for example, that sides WX and XY are the sides. We know WX is 10, but we don't know XY. Let's call XY = c. Then, the formula becomes:

2² + (a-7)^2 = 2(10² + c²)  
→ 4 + (a-7)^2 = 200 + 2c²

But we have two variables, a and c. Need another equation. Where could it come from?

Maybe the length of XZ is related to the sides. In a parallelogram, the length of diagonal XZ can be calculated using the formula:

XZ² = WX² + XY² + 2*WX*XY*cos(theta), where theta is the angle between WX and XY. But without knowing theta, this is not helpful.

Alternatively, if we assume that the other diagonal WY is 2, and we have another expression for it. In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, so the length of diagonal WY is 2, so its halves are 1. But how does this relate to the sides?

Alternatively, using the formula for the diagonals:

If the diagonals are d1 and d2, then:

d1 = 2 * sqrt(s1² + s2² - 2*s1*s2*cos(theta))  
d2 = 2 * sqrt(s1² + s2² + 2*s1*s2*cos(theta))  

But this seems complicated.

Wait, but we know one diagonal is 2 (YZ=WY), and the other is a-7 (XZ). So, let's denote:

Let d1 = 2, d2 = a-7. Then:

From the formula, d1² + d2² = 2(s1² + s2²)

So, 4 + (a-7)^2 = 2(10² + c²), where c is the length of the other side (XY). But we still don't know c. 

But if we can find another relationship involving c, we can solve for a. 

Wait, what about the other diagonal? If we can express it in terms of the sides. For example, if we know the length of XZ, which is a-7, and it's also related to the sides. Let me recall that in a parallelogram, the length of the diagonal can be expressed as:

XZ² = WX² + XY² - 2*WX*XY*cos(theta), where theta is the angle between sides WX and XY. Similarly, WY² = WX² + XY² + 2*WX*XY*cos(theta).

But since we know WY = 2, we have:

WY² = 4 = WX² + XY² + 2*WX*XY*cos(theta)  
= 100 + c² + 2*10*c*cos(theta) ... (1)

Similarly, XZ² = (a-7)^2 = WX² + XY² - 2*WX*XY*cos(theta)  
= 100 + c² - 2*10*c*cos(theta) ... (2)

Adding equations (1) and (2):

4 + (a-7)^2 = 2*(100 + c²)  
Which is the same as before: 4 + (a-7)^2 = 200 + 2c²  
→ (a-7)^2 = 196 + 2c² ... (3)

But we still have two variables, a and c. Need another equation. Let's subtract (2) from (1):

[4] - [(a-7)^2] = [100 + c² + 2*10*c*cos(theta)] - [100 + c² - 2*10*c*cos(theta)]  
→ 4 - (a-7)^2 = 40*c*cos(theta) ... (4)

But without knowing theta or c, this is not helpful. 

However, if we could find another relation involving c. For example, if we know the length of YA. Recall that YA is 2b-6. Where is point A? If A is the midpoint of diagonal XZ, then YA would be the distance from Y to A. Let's try to calculate this.

Point A is the midpoint of XZ. Coordinates of X are (10, 0) and Z are (p, q). Wait, but earlier attempts to assign coordinates failed due to conflicting lengths. Let me try again with the current setup.

Let me define the coordinates properly. Let me assume that W is at (0, 0), X is at (10, 0). Let vector WX be (10, 0). Let vector WZ be (p, q), so Z is at (p, q). Then, since it's a parallelogram, Y is at X + WZ = (10+p, q). 

Now, the diagonal WY goes from W (0,0) to Y (10+p, q). Its length is sqrt((10+p)^2 + q^2) = 2. So:

(10+p)^2 + q^2 = 4 ... (5)

The diagonal XZ goes from X (10,0) to Z (p, q). Its length is sqrt((p-10)^2 + q^2) = a-7. So:

(p-10)^2 + q^2 = (a-7)^2 ... (6)

Also, the length of YZ is the distance between Y (10+p, q) and Z (p, q), which is sqrt((10+p - p)^2 + (q - q)^2) = sqrt(10^2 + 0) = 10. But the given is YZ=2. This is a contradiction. Hence, this setup is invalid.

This suggests that YZ cannot be a diagonal, as it results in length 10. Hence, my assumption is wrong. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to revisit the original problem and look for alternative interpretations. Let me read the problem again.

"Find a in the given parallelogram."

Given predicates:

- Length of WX is 10.
- Length of YZ is 2.
- Length of XZ is a-7.
- Length of YA is 2b-6.
- Points W, X, Y, Z, A.
- Lines WX, YZ, XZ, YA.

Maybe the key is that in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. So, if XZ is a side, then it should be equal to another side. But XZ is a-7, and we have WX=10 and YZ=2. So if XZ is a side, it must be equal to one of the other sides. For example, if XZ is equal to YZ, then a-7=2 → a=9. This would be option C. Let's check if this fits.

If a=9, then XZ=2. So, if XZ is a side, and YZ is another side, then they are equal, making it a parallelogram. But then, what about the other sides? If WX=10, then the opposite side should also be 10. So, if XZ is 2, then the opposite side would be YZ=2, and the other pair of sides would be WX=10 and another side equal to 10. But then, how does this fit with the other given lengths?

Wait, if XZ is a side, then it should be parallel and equal to YZ. So, if XZ=2 and YZ=2, then they are equal. Then, the other sides would be WX=10 and another side equal to 10. But where is point A? The line YA has length 2
