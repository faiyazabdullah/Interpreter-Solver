Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, first, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out what's going on here. Let me start by listing out everything given.

We have points labeled G, J, K, H, B, and L. Wait, L is mentioned as a Circle(L), so maybe L is the center? Or perhaps it's just a label for the circle. Also, there are several lines: Line(G, J), Line(K, H), Line(J, K). Then there are angles: Angle(G, J, K) and Angle(K, H, J). Their measures are given as 83 degrees and 2x - 27 degrees respectively. Also, several points lie on the circle L: G, J, K, H, B. And point B lies on the line connecting J and K.

The question is asking whether GH is congruent to KJ, and we need to find x. The answer choices are A. 27, B. 54, C. 55, D. 83.

First, let me visualize the diagram. Points G, J, K are connected by lines. There's also a circle passing through these points, since they all lie on Circle(L). Also, H is another point on the same circle. Additionally, point B is on the line JK.

So, let me think about the angles given. The measure of angle at J between G and K is 83 degrees. That would be angle GJK. Then, the other angle is at H between K and J, so angle K H J. Wait, the notation for angles can sometimes be confusing. Let me confirm: Angle(K, H, J) means the angle at point H between points K and J. So vertex at H, with segments HK and HJ. But wait, if H is on the circle, and J is also on the circle, then maybe there's some cyclic quadrilateral involved?

Wait, but the points G, J, K, H are all on the circle. So that forms a quadrilateral? Maybe G, J, K, H are concyclic. But how do they connect? Let me check the lines again. There's Line(G,J), Line(K,H), and Line(J,K). So points G-J-K form a straight line? No, because Line(G,J) and Line(J,K) meet at J. So points G, J, K are colinear? Because Line(G,J) connects G and J, and Line(J,K) connects J and K. Therefore, points G, J, K are colinear, forming a straight line. Wait, but then angle GJK would be a straight angle? But the measure is given as 83 degrees. That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation.

Hold on. Let me clarify the angle notation. Angle(G, J, K) means the angle at point J formed by points G, J, K. So vertex at J, with sides JG and JK. Similarly, Angle(K, H, J) is the angle at point H, with sides HK and HJ. Wait, but if H is on the circle, and J is also on the circle, then maybe triangle K H J is part of the circle?

But earlier, points G, J, K are colinear? Because Line(G,J) and Line(J,K) are two lines meeting at J, implying that G, J, K are colinear. So if G, J, K are colinear, then angle GJK would be 180 degrees, but the problem says it's 83 degrees. That's a contradiction. So my assumption must be wrong. Wait, perhaps the lines are not colinear? Wait, Line(G,J) and Line(J,K) could be two different lines intersecting at J. So points G, J, K are such that G is on one line, J is the common point, and K is on another line. So G, J, K are not necessarily colinear. Wait, but Line(G,J) is a line segment between G and J, and Line(J,K) is a line segment between J and K. So those two lines meet at J, but G, J, K are three separate points connected via lines. Therefore, angle at J between G and K is 83 degrees. So triangle GJK has angle at J of 83 degrees. 

Then, the second angle is Angle(K, H, J), which is the angle at H between K and J. So that would be angle K H J. Now, since H is on the circle passing through G, J, K, and B. So points G, J, K, H, B are all on the same circle. So that implies that quadrilateral GJHK is cyclic? Or maybe G, J, K, H are vertices of a cyclic quadrilateral.

Now, considering that, maybe there are some properties of cyclic quadrilaterals that can be applied here. For example, opposite angles summing to 180 degrees. However, we have angles at J and H. Alternatively, maybe power of a point or something else.

Also, note that point B lies on line JK. Since points J and K are on the circle, and B is another point on the circle. Wait, but if B is on line JK and also on the circle, that suggests that line JK intersects the circle at points J and K, and B is another intersection point? But if line JK passes through J and K, which are already on the circle, then unless B is one of them, but B is a distinct point. Wait, but the problem states that PointLiesOnCircle(B, Circle(L)), so B is on the circle. So line JK passes through J and K, which are on the circle, and also contains B. Therefore, B must be either J or K, but since B is a separate point, that suggests that line JK extended meets the circle again at B. Wait, but if J and K are on the circle, then line JK is a chord of the circle. If B is another point on line JK and on the circle, then B must coincide with J or K, but since B is a different point, that's impossible. Therefore, perhaps my initial understanding is incorrect.

Wait, maybe line JK is not a chord but something else. Wait, but J and K are points on the circle, so line JK is a chord. Therefore, any point on line JK that's also on the circle must be J or K. Hence, B cannot be another point on line JK. Unless the line JK is tangent to the circle, but that would mean it touches only at one point. But J and K are two distinct points on the circle, so line JK is a secant. Therefore, B cannot be on line JK and also on the circle unless it's J or K. This seems contradictory. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in my interpretation.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: "PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(J, K))". So B is on line JK. But also, B is on the circle. So that implies that B is a third intersection point of line JK with the circle. But since J and K are already on the circle, line JK intersects the circle at J and K. Therefore, B must be one of them. However, the problem refers to point B separately, so perhaps B is J or K? But that would conflict with the labels. Alternatively, maybe there's a typo, but assuming the problem is correctly stated, perhaps there's another way.

Alternatively, maybe line JK is extended beyond J or K to meet the circle again at B. Wait, but if J and K are endpoints of a chord, then extending line JK beyond J would go outside the circle. Unless the circle is large enough. Wait, but in general, a line passing through two points on a circle can intersect the circle only at those two points. So unless the line is tangent, but it's passing through two points. Therefore, B can't be on line JK and on the circle except J and K. Therefore, this suggests that there's a contradiction. Hmm, maybe I misread something.

Let me recheck the problem statement. It says:

"Line(G, J) Line(K, H) Line(J, K)

Angle(G, J, K) Angle(K, H, J)

PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(J, K))"

Ah! Wait, Line(G,J) is one line, Line(K,H) is another, and Line(J,K) is another. So line JK is present. So point B is on line JK. But since J and K are on the circle, then line JK is a chord of the circle, hence intersecting the circle at J and K. So B is a third point on line JK and on the circle. Which is only possible if B coincides with J or K, but since B is a separate point, this seems conflicting. Therefore, there must be something wrong here. Unless the line JK is not a chord, but maybe J and K are not both on the circle? But the problem says PointLiesOnCircle(J, Circle(L)), PointLiesOnCircle(K, Circle(L)). So both J and K are on the circle. Thus, line JK is a chord. Therefore, the only points on line JK that are on the circle are J and K. Therefore, B cannot be on line JK and on the circle unless it's J or K. But the problem states that B is a separate point. Therefore, this seems like an inconsistency. Perhaps there's an error in my understanding of the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps the line JK is not a straight line? No, lines are straight. Alternatively, maybe the circle is degenerate? Unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the line JK is tangent at one of the points? But then it would only touch at one point. But J and K are both on the circle. So that's not possible. Therefore, there's something wrong here. Maybe the problem is that B is not on line JK, but on the line segment JK? But the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(J, K)), which includes the entire line. Hmm.

This seems like a contradiction. But perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that there is a mistake in my thinking. Let me try to move forward.

Assuming that B is on line JK and on the circle. Then, since J and K are on the circle, and line JK intersects the circle at J and K, then B must be one of them. But since B is mentioned separately, maybe it's a typo and should be another point? Or maybe there's more to the configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the line JK is extended beyond K to a point B on the circle? Wait, but if we extend line JK beyond K, then B would be a new point on the line and on the circle. But that would require that line JK extended meets the circle again at B. But since J and K are on the circle, then line JK is already a chord. Extending it would not meet the circle again unless the circle is larger. Wait, for example, if the circle has radius large enough, then extending line JK beyond K would still be outside the circle. So B cannot be on line JK and on the circle unless it's J or K. Therefore, this seems impossible. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding.

Maybe the problem meant that B is on line GK or something else? Or perhaps the line JB or KB? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the line BH? But the problem says Line(J, K).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves another circle? Wait, no. All points G, J, K, H, B are on Circle(L). So all five points are on the same circle. Therefore, line JK is a chord of the circle, and B is another point on the circle. Therefore, B must be one of the existing points. But the problem says PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(J, K)), which is a line containing J and K, so B is on that line. Therefore, B must be J, K, or another intersection point. But since J and K are already on the circle, the only possibility is that B is J or K. But the problem mentions B as a separate point, so perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup. But assuming that the problem is correct, maybe I need to reinterpret.

Alternatively, maybe B is not on the circle? But the predicate says PointLiesOnCircle(B, Circle(L)), so B is on the circle. Therefore, this is a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps there's a miscalculation in my assumptions.

Let me try to set aside this confusion for a moment and focus on the angles. We have angle GJK = 83 degrees, and angle K H J = 2x - 27 degrees. Also, all points are on the circle, so maybe these angles relate to arcs or something.

Since points G, J, K, H are on the circle, then angle GJK is an inscribed angle. Wait, angle at J between G and K. So that would subtend arc GK. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its subtended arc. So angle GJK = ½(arc GK). Similarly, angle K H J is an inscribed angle at point H, subtending arc KJ. Wait, angle at H between K and J, so that would subtend arc KJ. Therefore, angle K H J = ½(arc KJ). 

But since points G, J, K, H are on the circle, arcs GK and KJ would be parts of the circumference. Also, the total circumference corresponds to 360 degrees. 

But if angle GJK = 83 degrees, then arc GK is 166 degrees. Similarly, angle K H J = 2x - 27 degrees, so arc KJ is 2*(2x - 27) = 4x - 54 degrees. 

However, since points G, J, K, H are on the circle, the arcs may add up to certain totals. For example, if we consider the arcs between consecutive points. But without knowing the order of the points on the circle, it's hard to say. However, since angle at H subtends arc KJ, and angle at J subtends arc GK, perhaps there's a relationship between these arcs.

Alternatively, maybe there's a cyclic quadrilateral involved. For instance, if points G, J, H, K are on the circle, forming a quadrilateral. But depending on the order, the arcs could vary. 

Alternatively, maybe triangle GJK and triangle K H J are related? Wait, angle GJK and angle K H J are given. Let me think about triangle K H J. In that triangle, angle at H is 2x - 27 degrees. What about other angles?

But since H is on the circle, and J and K are on the circle, then maybe triangle K H J is inscribed in the circle. Therefore, angles relate to arcs. Also, if we can find relations between arcs, we might be able to find equations involving x.

Additionally, the question asks if GH is congruent to KJ. So GH ≅ KJ. In terms of arcs, if two chords are congruent, their subtended arcs are congruent. Therefore, if GH and KJ are congruent chords, then their arcs are congruent. So arc GH equals arc KJ. 

But how does that tie into the angles we know? Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe GH and KJ are sides of triangles where we can use the Law of Sines or Cosines. For example, in triangle GJK, we know angle at J is 83 degrees, and in triangle K H J, we know angle at H is 2x - 27 degrees. But without more information about sides or other angles, it's challenging.

Wait, but all points are on the circle. So maybe we can use the fact that chords corresponding to arcs. For example, chord length depends on the arc it subtends. So if GH ≅ KJ, then their arcs are congruent. So arc GH = arc KJ. 

Earlier, we had arc GK = 166 degrees (from angle GJK being 83°). If arc KJ is 4x - 54 degrees, then if arc GH equals arc KJ, we could relate them somehow. But how?

Alternatively, maybe considering the full circle. Suppose the arcs around the circle add up to 360 degrees. But without knowing the order of the points, it's tricky. However, if we assume that points are arranged in order G, J, K, H around the circle, then the arcs between them would be arc GJ, arc JK, arc KH, arc HG. But without knowing the order, it's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another approach. Since GH and KJ are congruent chords, their subtended arcs are congruent. So arc GH = arc KJ. Also, angle GJK subtends arc GK, which is 166 degrees. Angle K H J subtends arc KJ, which is 4x - 54 degrees. If we can find a relation between these arcs.

But how? Let me think. Suppose that the arc GK is composed of arc GJ + arc JK. If points G, J, K are in order on the circle, then arc GK = arc GJ + arc JK. But I don't know the position of H. Alternatively, maybe there's another relationship.

Wait, but we have point H on the circle, and angle K H J is given. If we consider the arc that this angle subtends. As mentioned before, angle at H subtends arc KJ, so arc KJ = 2*(angle K H J) = 2*(2x - 27) = 4x - 54 degrees.

Similarly, angle at J (GJK) subtends arc GK = 2*83 = 166 degrees.

Now, if GH is congruent to KJ, then arc GH equals arc KJ. So arc GH = arc KJ = 4x - 54 degrees.

But what's arc GH? It depends on where H is located relative to G. If points G, H, J, K are arranged around the circle, then arc GH could be part of the circle. However, without knowing the exact arrangement, it's difficult. But maybe there's another way.

Alternatively, consider triangle GHK or something. Wait, maybe using the fact that GH and KJ are congruent chords, leading to their arcs being equal. So arc GH = arc KJ = 4x - 54 degrees.

But we also know arc GK = 166 degrees. If we can express arc GK in terms of other arcs.

For example, suppose that the arc from G to K goes through H. So arc GK = arc GH + arc HK. But we don't know arc HK. Alternatively, if arc GK is directly connected, then it's arc GK = arc GJ + arc JK. But again, without knowing the order of the points, it's challenging.

Alternatively, since all points are on the circle, maybe there's a way to relate the arcs using the angles. For example, if we can find another angle that relates to arc GH.

Alternatively, consider that angle at H, which is angle K H J = 2x - 27 degrees, and that angle subtends arc KJ = 4x - 54 degrees. Also, angle at J, which is 83 degrees, subtends arc GK = 166 degrees. If we can find another equation relating these arcs.

Suppose that the total circumference is 360 degrees. So the sum of all arcs around the circle is 360. Let me denote:

arc GJ = a

arc JK = b

arc KH = c

arc HG = d

Then, a + b + c + d = 360 degrees.

From angle GJK subtending arc GK. Arc GK would be arc GJ + arc JK = a + b = 166 degrees.

From angle K H J subtending arc KJ = b = 4x - 54 degrees.

If arc GH = d = arc KJ = b = 4x - 54 degrees. Since GH and KJ are congruent chords, their arcs are equal. So d = b.

Therefore, substituting:

a + b = 166 degrees.

d = b.

And a + b + c + d = 360 => a + b + c + b = 360 => a + 2b + c = 360.

But we don't know c. However, if we can find another equation involving c.

Alternatively, consider the arc from H to G, which is d = arc HG. If there's another angle that subtends this arc. For example, if there's an angle at some point that subtends arc HG. But without more information, it's unclear.

Alternatively, since point B is on line JK and on the circle, even though earlier contradiction arises. Maybe B is the other intersection point of line JK with the circle, which would imply that B is either J or K. But since it's a different point, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem, but assuming that B is the same as one of the points. Alternatively, maybe B is the midpoint or something. But this is getting too speculative.

Alternatively, maybe focusing back on the angles. We have two expressions involving x: arc KJ = 4x - 54 degrees, and arc GK = 166 degrees. If there's a way to relate these arcs.

Suppose that arc GK + arc KJ = arc GJ + arc JK + arc KJ? No, that doesn't seem helpful.

Wait, if arc GK is 166 degrees, and arc KJ is 4x - 54 degrees. If we can find the relationship between arc GK and arc KJ.

But without knowing the position of H, it's hard to see. However, since GH is congruent to KJ, arc GH = arc KJ = 4x - 54 degrees. Also, arc GH is part of the circle. If we consider the arc from G to H, which is d = 4x - 54 degrees. Also, arc GK is 166 degrees, which is arc GJ + arc JK = a + b = 166.

But how does arc GH relate to other arcs? If we imagine the circle, moving from G to H, it could pass through J or K. For example, if the points are ordered G, J, H, K around the circle, then arc GH would be arc GJ + arc JH. But without knowing the order, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that angle at H, which is angle K H J, which is 2x - 27 degrees, and that angle subtends arc KJ. So arc KJ = 2*(angle) = 2*(2x - 27) = 4x - 54 degrees.

Also, angle GJK is 83 degrees, subtending arc GK = 166 degrees.

Now, if we can find another angle that subtends arc GH, which is equal to arc KJ. For example, if there's an angle at some point that subtends arc GH. But without more info, it's hard.

Alternatively, since all points are on the circle, and GH and KJ are congruent chords, their arcs are congruent. So arc GH = arc KJ = 4x - 54 degrees. Also, arc GK = 166 degrees. If we can find a relationship between arc GK and arc GH.

If arc GK is made up of arc GJ + arc JK = a + b = 166 degrees. And arc GH = d = 4x - 54 degrees. If we can express d in terms of other arcs.

But unless there's more information, I might be stuck here. Let me think differently.

Since the question is about GH ≅ KJ, and we're asked to find x. Maybe there's a way to relate the angles to get an equation in x.

Let me recall that in a circle, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So:

Angle GJK = 83° = ½(arc GK) → arc GK = 166°

Angle K H J = 2x - 27° = ½(arc KJ) → arc KJ = 2*(2x - 27) = 4x - 54°

Now, if GH is congruent to KJ, then their arcs are congruent. So arc GH = arc KJ = 4x - 54°.

Now, the arc GH is part of the circle. Let's assume that the points are arranged in the order G, J, K, H around the circle. Then, arc GH would consist of arc GJ + arc JK + arc KH? No, if it's from G to H, passing through J and K, then it would be arc GJ + arc JK + arc KH. But that seems long. Alternatively, if the points are arranged G, H, J, K around the circle, then arc GH would be the arc from G to H directly, not passing through J or K.

Without knowing the exact arrangement, it's challenging, but maybe there's another way. Let's consider that the sum of arcs around the circle is 360°.

If arc GK = 166°, and arc KJ = 4x - 54°, and arc GH = 4x - 54°, then maybe combining these arcs.

Assume that arc GK and arc KJ are adjacent. If points G, K, J are in order, then arc GK + arc KJ = arc GJ. Wait, no. If points are G, K, J in order, then arc GK plus arc KJ would be arc GJ. But arc GK is 166°, arc KJ is 4x - 54°, so arc GJ = 166 + (4x - 54) = 4x + 112 degrees. But this might not help directly.

Alternatively, if arc GH = arc KJ, then maybe there's symmetry in the circle. For example, if arc GH = arc KJ, then the chords GH and KJ are congruent. 

But how to relate this with the given angles? Maybe there's another angle that subtends arc GH. For instance, if there's an angle at some point that intercepts arc GH. But without knowing where H is, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, consider triangle GHK or something. Let me think about triangle GHK. If I can find angles or sides.

Wait, but I don't have much info. Let me try to think of another approach.

Since all points are on the circle, maybe applying the Law of Cosines on the chords. For example, the length of a chord is 2R sin(θ/2), where θ is the subtended arc and R is the radius. So if GH and KJ are congruent, then their subtended arcs are congruent. So arc GH = arc KJ. Which we've already established as 4x - 54 degrees. 

But we also know arc GK = 166 degrees. If we can find another equation involving these arcs. For example, if arc GK + arc GH = something.

Wait, if points G, H, K are on the circle, then arc GK could be split into arc GH + arc HK. So arc GK = arc GH + arc HK. Therefore, 166 = (4x - 54) + arc HK. So arc HK = 166 - (4x - 54) = 166 - 4x + 54 = 220 - 4x degrees.

But I don't know anything about arc HK. However, maybe there's another angle that subtends arc HK. For example, if there's an angle at some point that intercepts arc HK.

Alternatively, since point B is on line JK and on the circle, maybe there's something about power of a point. For example, if B is on line JK and on the circle, then power of point B with respect to the circle is zero, since it's on the circle. But I don't see how that helps.

Alternatively, if B is on line JK, and since J and K are on the circle, then line JK is a chord, and B is another point on the circle. So B must be J or K, but since it's a separate point, this seems contradictory. Maybe the problem assumes that B is the same as one of the points? Like B=J or B=K? But then the line JB or KB would be trivial. But the problem states PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(J, K)), which would hold true if B is J or K.

But if B is J, then it's redundant, as J is already defined. Similarly for K. This suggests that there's likely an error in the problem statement, but since we have to work with it, perhaps we should proceed under the assumption that there's a typo and B is supposed to be another point. Alternatively, maybe B is the midpoint of arc JK or something. But without more info, it's hard to say.

Given that I'm stuck on this, perhaps I should focus on the angles and the arcs I have. Let's summarize:

arc GK = 166°

arc KJ = 4x - 54°

arc GH = arc KJ = 4x - 54°

If I can find another relationship involving these arcs. Let's consider the total circumference. Assume that the remaining arcs add up to 360° - arc GK - arc KJ - arc GH.

Wait, but arc GK is 166°, arc KJ is 4x - 54°, and arc GH is also 4x - 54°. So total of these three arcs is 166 + (4x - 54) + (4x - 54) = 166 + 8x - 108 = 8x + 58 degrees. The remaining arc would be 360 - (8x + 58) = 302 - 8x degrees. But without knowing what that represents, it's not helpful.

Alternatively, if I assume that the arc from H to G is the same as arc KJ, then perhaps there's a symmetry. But without knowing the arrangement, it's guesswork.

Wait, let's think about triangle K H J. We know angle at H is 2x - 27°. If we can find other angles in this triangle, perhaps using the fact that it's inscribed in the circle. For example, if we can find other angles or relate them to arcs.

In triangle K H J, the angles are:

At H: 2x - 27°

At J: ?

At K: ?

But without knowing the other angles, it's hard. However, since it's inscribed in the circle, the sum of angles is 180°. So:

angle at H + angle at J + angle at K = 180°

But angle at J and angle at K are inscribed angles subtending certain arcs.

Angle at J in triangle K H J: this is angle HJK. What arc does this subtend? It would subtend arc HK. So angle at J (in triangle K H J) is ½(arc HK).

Similarly, angle at K in triangle K H J is angle H K J, which subtends arc HJ. So angle at K is ½(arc HJ).

Thus:

(2x - 27) + ½(arc HK) + ½(arc HJ) = 180°

But we don't know arc HK or arc HJ. However, arc HJ could be related to other arcs.

Recall that arc GK = 166°, which is arc GJ + arc JK = a + b = 166°. If we can express arc HJ in terms of other arcs.

But this seems too vague. Let me try to substitute what I know.

From earlier, arc HK = 220 - 4x degrees (from earlier calculation: arc GK = arc GH + arc HK → 166 = (4x - 54) + arc HK → arc HK = 220 - 4x).

Arc HJ would depend on the position of H. Assuming that arc HJ is part of the circle. Without knowing the arrangement, it's hard to define. 

Alternatively, if we consider that arc HJ is equal to arc GK or something. But this is speculation.

Alternatively, since all points are on the circle, and we have arc KJ = 4x - 54, arc GH = 4x - 54, and arc GK = 166. Maybe there's a way to find x by considering that the sum of arcs around the circle adds up to 360°.

Let me try to assume that the arcs are arranged as follows: arc GK = 166°, arc KJ = 4x - 54°, arc JH = ?, arc HG = 4x - 54°. If I can find the missing arc.

But without knowing the order, it's hard. Let me assume that the points are arranged in the order G, H, J, K around the circle. Then, the arcs would be:

arc GH = 4x - 54° (since GH is congruent to KJ)

arc HJ = ?

arc JK = 4x - 54° (since arc KJ is 4x - 54°)

arc KG = 166° (arc GK)

But then total circumference would be arc GH + arc HJ + arc JK + arc KG = 360°.

Substituting:

(4x - 54) + arc HJ + (4x - 54) + 166 = 360

Combine like terms:

8x - 108 + arc HJ + 166 = 360

→ 8x + 58 + arc HJ = 360

→ arc HJ = 360 - 8x - 58 = 302 - 8x

Now, arc HJ is the arc from H to J, which is part of the circle. But we also have angle at J in triangle K H J, which subtends arc HK. Earlier, we said arc HK = 220 - 4x degrees. Wait, how did we get that? Earlier, I assumed that arc GK = arc GH + arc HK, but that was under the assumption that the points are arranged G, H, K. But if the points are arranged G, H, J, K, then arc GK would be arc GJ + arc JK, not arc GH + arc HK. So my previous calculation of arc HK = 220 - 4x was incorrect under this new assumption.

Let me redo that. If the points are arranged G, H, J, K around the circle, then arc GK would be arc GJ + arc JK. But arc GJ would be arc GH + arc HJ. So arc GK = (arc GH + arc HJ) + arc JK = (4x - 54) + arc HJ + (4x - 54) = 8x - 108 + arc HJ. But arc GK is given as 166°, so:

8x - 108 + arc HJ = 166 → arc HJ = 166 - 8x + 108 = 274 - 8x.

But earlier, we had arc HJ = 302 - 8x from the total circumference. Wait, no, previously, under the assumption that arc HJ = 302 - 8x, and here arc HJ = 274 - 8x. This is a contradiction unless 302 - 8x = 274 - 8x → 302 = 274, which is false. Therefore, my assumptions about the arrangement are inconsistent.

This suggests that my assumption about the order of the points is wrong. Let me try another arrangement. Suppose the points are arranged G, J, H, K around the circle. Then:

arc GK would be arc GJ + arc JK. Arc GJ is arc GJ, arc JK is arc JK. But arc GJ is from G to J, which is a single arc. Arc JK is from J to K.

But arc GH would be arc GJ + arc JH. Since arc GH = 4x - 54, and arc JH is part of the circle.

This is getting too complicated. Perhaps there's another approach.

Let me return to the equation for the total circumference. From earlier, I had:

Total circumference = 360° = arc GK + arc KJ + arc JH + arc HG

Wait, no. Depending on the arrangement, it varies. Let me try a different approach.

We know arc GK = 166°, arc KJ = 4x - 54°, and arc GH = 4x - 54°.

If I assume that arc GH and arc KJ are parts of the circle, then the remaining arcs would be arc GJ and arc HK. Let me write:

Total circumference = arc GK + arc KJ + arc JH + ... ? No, this isn't helping.

Alternatively, since arc GK = 166°, and arc KJ = 4x - 54°, and arc GH = 4x - 54°, maybe adding these together gives us part of the circle. Let's say:

arc GK + arc KJ + arc GH = 166 + (4x - 54) + (4x - 54) = 166 + 8x - 108 = 8x + 58.

If this is part of the circle, then the remaining arc is 360 - (8x + 58) = 302 - 8x. But what is this remaining arc? It could be arc from H to G, but that's already accounted for in arc GH. Or it could be another arc. This is too ambiguous.

Perhaps I need to consider that the sum of arc GK and arc KJ is related to other arcs. For example, if arc GK + arc KJ = arc GJ + arc JK + arc KJ = arc GJ + 2*arc KJ. Not helpful.

Alternatively, since GH ≅ KJ, their arcs are equal. So arc GH = arc KJ = 4x - 54°. And arc GK = 166°. If I can find another equation involving x.

Wait, let's think about triangle GJK. It has angle at J of 83°, and sides GJ, JK, and GK. If I can relate these sides using the Law of Sines.

In triangle GJK, by the Law of Sines:

GJ / sin(angle at K) = JK / sin(angle at G) = GK / sin(83°)

But I don't know any other angles or side lengths. However, since all points are on the circle, perhaps using the Law of Sines for the circle.

Wait, in a circle, the length of a chord is 2R sin(θ/2), where θ is the subtended arc. So:

Length of chord GJ = 2R sin(θ_GJ/2), where θ_GJ is arc GJ.

Similarly, length of chord JK = 2R sin(θ_JK/2), where θ_JK is arc JK.

Length of chord GK = 2R sin(θ_GK/2), where θ_GK is arc GK = 166°.

But since GH ≅ KJ, their lengths are equal. So length GH = length KJ.

Length GH = 2R sin(θ_GH/2) = length KJ = 2R sin(θ_KJ/2).

Since θ_GH = θ_KJ = 4x - 54°, this holds true. So this doesn't give new information.

But maybe relating other chords. For example, in triangle GJK, using the Law of Sines:

GJ / sin(angle at K) = JK / sin(angle at G) = GK / sin(83°)

But angle at K in triangle GJK is angle GJK? No, angle at K is angle G K J. Wait, in triangle GJK, the angles are at G, J, and K. We know angle at J is 83°. Let me call angle at G as α and angle at K as β.

So α + β + 83° = 180° → α + β = 97°.

By the Law of Sines:

GJ / sinβ = JK / sinα = GK / sin83°

But I don't know α or β, nor any side lengths. So this might not help.

But since GJ and JK are chords of the circle, their lengths relate to their subtended arcs. Let me denote:

arc GJ = a

arc JK = b

arc GK = 166° = a + b (if points G, J, K are in order)

So, from above, a + b = 166°.

Also, from angle at H, arc KJ = b = 4x - 54°.

Wait, earlier I thought arc KJ is 4x - 54°, but if arc KJ is the arc from K to J, then it would be the same as arc JK, which is b. So b = 4x - 54°.

So from a + b = 166°, and b = 4x - 54°, we have a = 166 - b = 166 - (4x - 54) = 220 - 4x.

Now, since arc GH = b = 4x - 54°, as GH ≅ KJ.

But what is arc GH? It depends on where H is. If arc GH is the same as arc KJ, then it's b = 4x - 54°. Now, if I can relate arc GH to other arcs.

Assuming that arc GH is part of the circle, and since all points are on the circle, maybe there's another relation. For example, if arc GH is equal to arc KJ, and arc KJ is b, then arc GH = b.

If I can find another expression for arc GH in terms of other arcs. For example, if arc GH is part of the circle, it could be arc GJ + arc JH, or arc GK + arc KH, depending on the arrangement.

Assume that arc GH = arc GJ + arc JH = a + arc JH = b = 4x - 54°.

So, a + arc JH = 4x - 54°.

But a = 220 - 4x, so:

220 - 4x + arc JH = 4x - 54

→ arc JH = 4x - 54 - 220 + 4x = 8x - 274 degrees.

Now, arc JH is the arc from J to H. Let me think about this arc. If I can relate it to other angles or arcs.

In triangle K H J, we had angle at H = 2x - 27°, which subtends arc KJ = b = 4x - 54°. Also, angle at J in triangle K H J subtends arc HK, and angle at K subtends arc HJ.

From earlier, angle at J in triangle K H J is ½(arc HK), and angle at K is ½(arc HJ).

So, in triangle K H J:

angle at H: 2x - 27° = ½(arc KJ) = ½b = ½(4x - 54) → this checks out.

angle at J: let's call it γ = ½(arc HK)

angle at K: let's call it δ = ½(arc HJ)

So γ + δ + (2x - 27) = 180°

But arc HK and arc HJ are related. Let me find arc HK.

From earlier, arc HK can be found if we know the total circumference. Let me assume that the total circumference is 360°, and we have:

arc GK = 166° (which is a + b = 220 - 4x + 4x - 54 = 166°, which checks out)

arc KJ = b = 4x - 54°

arc GH = b = 4x - 54°

arc JH = 8x - 274° (from earlier)

So total circumference = arc GK + arc KJ + arc JH + arc HG? Wait, no. Let me think about all arcs.

Actually, the circle is divided into arcs by the points G, J, K, H. Depending on their arrangement, the arcs would be:

Between G and J: a = 220 - 4x

Between J and K: b = 4x - 54

Between K and H: let's say c

Between H and G: d = b = 4x - 54

So total circumference: a + b + c + d = 360°

Substitute a = 220 - 4x, b = 4x - 54, d = 4x - 54:

(220 - 4x) + (4x - 54) + c + (4x - 54) = 360

Simplify:

220 - 4x + 4x - 54 + c + 4x - 54 = 360

Combine like terms:

220 - 54 - 54 + (-
