Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two congruent triangles, LMN and QRS. The question is asking for the value of x. Let me start by recalling that if two triangles are congruent, their corresponding angles and sides are equal. 

First, I need to figure out which angles correspond between the two triangles. Since the order of the letters matters in triangle congruence, triangle LMN corresponds to triangle QRS. That means angle L corresponds to angle Q, angle M corresponds to angle R, and angle N corresponds to angle S. Wait, but the problem gives us some angle measures with variables. Let me list out the given predicates again:

- Measure of Angle(N, L, M) = 3x + 5. Wait, how do these angles relate? Let me think about the notation. In angle notation, Angle(N, L, M) would mean the angle at point L between points N and M. Wait, no—actually, the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(N, L, M) is the angle at point L formed by points N, L, M. Similarly, Angle(S, R, Q) is the angle at point R formed by points S, R, Q. 

But since the triangles are congruent, their corresponding angles should be equal. Let me try to map them properly. Triangle LMN has vertices L, M, N. Triangle QRS has vertices Q, R, S. Because they're congruent, so ∠L in triangle LMN corresponds to ∠Q in triangle QRS. Similarly, ∠M corresponds to ∠R, and ∠N corresponds to ∠S. 

Wait, but the given angles are:

- Measure of Angle(N, L, M): This is angle at L between NL and ML. So that's angle L of triangle LMN. Which corresponds to angle Q of triangle QRS. But the measure here is given as 3x + 5. 

Then, Measure of Angle(S, R, Q): This is angle at R between SR and QR. So that's angle R of triangle QRS. Since triangle QRS corresponds to triangle LMN, angle R corresponds to angle M of triangle LMN. Therefore, angle R (which is given as 2x + 10) should equal angle M of triangle LMN. Wait, but maybe I need to check the correspondence again. Let me make sure.

Let me write down the correspondence. Since ΔLMN ≅ ΔQRS, the order of the vertices tells us the correspondence. So:

Vertex L in ΔLMN corresponds to Vertex Q in ΔQRS.

Vertex M corresponds to Vertex R.

Vertex N corresponds to Vertex S.

Therefore:

∠L (in LMN) corresponds to ∠Q (in QRS).

∠M (in LMN) corresponds to ∠R (in QRS).

∠N (in LMN) corresponds to ∠S (in QRS).

Now, looking at the given angle measures:

First predicate: Measure of Angle(N, L, M) is 3x + 5. As per above, angle at L in triangle LMN (∠L). So ∠L = 3x + 5. And since ∠L corresponds to ∠Q in triangle QRS. However, there's another angle given: Measure of Angle(S, R, Q) is 2x + 10. Let's parse that. Angle(S, R, Q) is the angle at R in triangle QRS, because the middle letter is R. So that's ∠R in QRS, which corresponds to ∠M in LMN. Therefore, ∠R (QRS) equals ∠M (LMN). Thus, 2x + 10 equals measure of ∠M in LMN.

So, if I can find expressions for other angles, perhaps I can set up equations. Also, there are more predicates:

Measure of Angle(M, N, S) is y + 6. Let's parse that. Angle(M, N, S) is the angle at N between MN and SN. Wait, but in triangle LMN, the vertices are L, M, N. So angle at N would be ∠N of triangle LMN. But the given angle here is ∠(M, N, S), which would be angle at N formed by points M, N, S. Wait, but S is part of triangle QRS. Hmm. Wait, maybe there's confusion here. Let me clarify.

Alternatively, maybe those angles are parts of different triangles. For example, ∠(M, N, S) could be an external angle or something else. Wait, but the problem mentions triangles LMN and QRS being congruent. Are there any other points involved? The problem doesn't mention other points, so maybe these angles are internal angles of the triangles?

Wait, let me re-examine each angle:

First angle: Angle(N, L, M) – this is angle at L, between NL and ML. So that's ∠L in triangle LMN.

Second angle: Angle(S, R, Q) – angle at R between SR and QR. That's ∠R in triangle QRS. Which corresponds to ∠M in triangle LMN.

Third angle: Angle(M, N, S) – angle at N between MN and SN. Wait, but SN isn't necessarily part of triangle LMN. Unless S is connected to N. Wait, since triangle QRS has points Q, R, S. So S is a vertex of triangle QRS. But how does that connect to triangle LMN? Maybe there's a diagram implied, but since it's not provided, I need to rely solely on the given predicates.

Wait, perhaps these angles are angles within the triangles. Let me consider that. For instance, ∠(M, N, S) could be an angle in triangle QRS? Or maybe in another triangle? Alternatively, maybe it's referring to a different configuration where points are connected. But without a diagram, this is challenging. Alternatively, maybe the angles given are angles in the same triangle?

Wait, let's take it one by one. The third predicate is Measure of Angle(M, N, S) = y + 6. So angle at N between points M, N, S. So that would be angle at N formed by connecting M to N to S. Now, if S is a point from triangle QRS, then maybe there's a connection between N and S? Since the triangles are congruent, but I don't know the specific connections. However, maybe these angles are angles in the triangles themselves?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a typo, and the intended angle was ∠(N, M, S)? Wait, but the notation is Angle(M, N, S), which is angle at N. So regardless of the triangle, the angle at N between points M and S.

Similarly, the fourth predicate: Measure of Angle(R, S, N) = 2y - 12. That's angle at S between R and N. So angle at S between RS and NS. Again, S is a point from triangle QRS, but again, without knowing the full structure, this is tricky.

Wait, maybe the key lies in the fact that triangles LMN and QRS are congruent. Therefore, their corresponding angles are equal. So, for example, ∠L corresponds to ∠Q, ∠M corresponds to ∠R, ∠N corresponds to ∠S. 

From the first two predicates:

Angle(N, L, M) is ∠L = 3x + 5. And since ∠L corresponds to ∠Q, which is part of triangle QRS. But the second angle given is ∠(S, R, Q) = 2x + 10. Which is ∠R in triangle QRS, which corresponds to ∠M in triangle LMN. Therefore, ∠M in LMN equals 2x + 10. 

So, in triangle LMN, the three angles are ∠L = 3x + 5, ∠M = 2x + 10, and ∠N. Then, since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, we can write:

(3x + 5) + (2x + 10) + ∠N = 180

Which simplifies to 5x + 15 + ∠N = 180 → ∠N = 165 - 5x.

But also, since the triangles are congruent, ∠N in triangle LMN corresponds to ∠S in triangle QRS. So ∠N (LMN) = ∠S (QRS). 

Looking at the third and fourth predicates:

Third: Measure of Angle(M, N, S) = y + 6. Let's see. If this angle is ∠N in triangle QRS? Wait, ∠(M, N, S) is the angle at N between M and S. But S is a vertex in triangle QRS. So if we imagine connecting N to S, then ∠(M, N, S) would be an angle involving point N and point S. But unless there's a specific relationship, like maybe triangle QRS having side SN? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe ∠(M, N, S) refers to an angle in triangle QRS? Let me think. If S is a vertex of triangle QRS, then ∠S is part of that triangle. But how does M come into play? Unless M is connected to S? Without a diagram, this is ambiguous. However, given that the problem involves two congruent triangles, perhaps there's a way to relate these angles via the congruence.

Alternatively, maybe the angles given are angles in the triangles. Let me think again. For example, ∠(M, N, S) could be an exterior angle or something else. But if I assume that ∠(M, N, S) is ∠N in triangle QRS, then that would be equal to ∠N in triangle LMN. But wait, ∠N in triangle LMN is 165 - 5x. So if ∠(M, N, S) is ∠N in triangle QRS, then that would be equal to ∠N in LMN. So:

y + 6 = 165 - 5x. Equation 1.

Fourth predicate: Measure of Angle(R, S, N) = 2y - 12. This angle is at S between R and N. So that would be ∠S in triangle QRS. Since triangle QRS's angles are ∠Q, ∠R, ∠S. From earlier, ∠R in QRS is 2x + 10 (since it corresponds to ∠M in LMN). ∠Q corresponds to ∠L in LMN, which is 3x + 5. And ∠S corresponds to ∠N in LMN, which is 165 - 5x. 

So the sum of angles in triangle QRS should be 180. So:

∠Q + ∠R + ∠S = (3x + 5) + (2x + 10) + (165 - 5x) = ?

Calculating:

3x + 5 + 2x + 10 + 165 -5x = (3x + 2x -5x) + (5 + 10 + 165) = 0x + 180. Which checks out. So that's consistent. 

But back to the fourth predicate: ∠(R, S, N) is ∠S in triangle QRS. Wait, no. Wait, angle at S between R and N. So in triangle QRS, ∠S is the angle at S between points Q, S, R. But the angle given here is ∠(R, S, N), which is angle at S between R and N. So this is different from ∠S in triangle QRS unless N is connected to S. Wait, but if triangles LMN and QRS are congruent, then maybe there's a connection between N and S? Like, maybe N is connected to S? Not sure. But assuming that ∠(R, S, N) is part of triangle QRS, then perhaps that's an external angle or something else. 

Alternatively, maybe ∠(R, S, N) is an angle in triangle QRS. Wait, if we consider triangle QRS, then the angles are at Q, R, S. So unless there's another triangle involving S and N. 

This seems complicated. Maybe I need to look for relations between the given angles. Let me recap:

We have from the first two predicates:

∠L (LMN) = 3x + 5

∠M (LMN) = 2x + 10

Thus, ∠N (LMN) = 180 - (3x+5) - (2x+10) = 180 -5x -15 = 165 -5x

Since ∠N (LMN) corresponds to ∠S (QRS). So ∠S (QRS) = 165 -5x.

Now, looking at the third predicate: Measure of Angle(M, N, S) = y + 6. Assuming this angle is ∠N (from earlier?), but not sure. Wait, if we consider ∠(M, N, S) as an angle in triangle QRS, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an angle in another triangle. Wait, if N is connected to S, then ∠(M, N, S) could be an angle in triangle MNS. But without knowing the rest of the connections, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, maybe ∠(M, N, S) is supplementary to some other angle. Wait, perhaps if I use the fact that triangles are congruent. Let me think. 

Alternatively, perhaps ∠(M, N, S) relates to ∠S in triangle QRS. Wait, if I imagine that point S is connected to N, forming a triangle or something. Suppose that ∠(M, N, S) is an exterior angle to triangle QRS. For example, if we extend some sides. But this is getting too speculative. 

Wait, but there's another equation from the fourth predicate: Measure of Angle(R, S, N) = 2y - 12. Let me denote that as ∠(R, S, N) = 2y - 12. If I can relate this angle to something else. 

Assuming that ∠(R, S, N) is part of triangle QRS. For example, if we have triangle QRS, then ∠S is already defined. But ∠(R, S, N) would be an angle at S between R and N. So if N is connected to S, then this angle could be adjacent to ∠S in triangle QRS. But if N is connected to S, then maybe that forms another triangle or a straight line. 

Alternatively, maybe ∠(R, S, N) is an exterior angle to triangle QRS. For example, if you extend a side. But again, without a diagram, this is difficult. 

Perhaps I need to consider that ∠(M, N, S) and ∠(R, S, N) are related through the congruence. Since triangles LMN and QRS are congruent, perhaps there are corresponding sides or angles that can be linked. 

Wait, let's go back. We have two equations from the third and fourth predicates. Let me note that:

Third predicate: ∠(M, N, S) = y + 6

Fourth predicate: ∠(R, S, N) = 2y - 12

If I can express these angles in terms of x and y, and then find equations to solve for x.

But how?

Let me think: If ∠(M, N, S) is an angle involving points M, N, S. Given that triangle LMN and QRS are congruent, maybe there's a way to link these angles. For example, suppose that S is a point such that SN is a common side or something. But again, without more info, it's tough. 

Wait, but maybe ∠(M, N, S) is ∠N in triangle QRS. Wait, earlier we had ∠S in triangle QRS is 165 - 5x. Is there a relation between ∠(M, N, S) and ∠S?

Alternatively, maybe ∠(M, N, S) is an angle outside of the triangles. For example, if you have triangle LMN and triangle QRS, and points connected in some way. 

Alternatively, perhaps these angles are supplementary or something. Let me try another approach.

We have two equations from the third and fourth predicates. Let me assume that ∠(M, N, S) and ∠(R, S, N) are angles that add up to something. For example, if they form a linear pair or something. 

Alternatively, since ∠(M, N, S) is at point N between M and S, and ∠(R, S, N) is at point S between R and N. Maybe these two angles are related through some triangle. 

Alternatively, think about triangle MSN. If we consider triangle MSN, then its angles would involve points M, S, N. So ∠MSN would be at point S. But I'm not sure. 

Wait, but if we consider triangle MSN, then the angles would be:

At point M: ∠SMN

At point S: ∠MSN

At point N: ∠MNS

But the given angle is ∠(M, N, S) which is ∠MNS (angle at N between M and S). So that would be ∠MNS. 

Similarly, ∠(R, S, N) is ∠(R, S, N) which is angle at S between R and N. So that would be ∠RSN. 

So if we consider triangle MSN, then ∠MNS (given as y + 6) and ∠RSN (given as 2y - 12) might be related. But how? Unless there's a relationship between these angles. 

Alternatively, if points R, S, N are colinear, but that's just speculation. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a transversal or something. 

This is getting too vague. Perhaps I need to look for another approach. 

Earlier, we had two equations involving y:

From the third predicate: ∠(M, N, S) = y + 6. Let's call this Equation 1.

From the fourth predicate: ∠(R, S, N) = 2y - 12. Call this Equation 2.

If I can find another relation between these angles, maybe through triangle congruence or some property. 

Wait, considering that triangles LMN and QRS are congruent, perhaps certain angles are equal. For example, if ∠(M, N, S) corresponds to some angle in triangle QRS. 

Alternatively, since ∠(M, N, S) is at point N, which corresponds to point S in triangle QRS. Wait, no. Earlier, we said that ∠N in triangle LMN corresponds to ∠S in triangle QRS. 

So ∠N (LMN) = ∠S (QRS) = 165 -5x. 

But if ∠(M, N, S) is an angle at N involving S, then maybe that's supplementary to ∠N (LMN)? For example, if ∠(M, N, S) and ∠N (LMN) form a linear pair. But that would require that points M, N, S are colinear with N between M and S, making ∠(M, N, S) a straight angle. But that would make it 180 degrees, which may not fit with the given expression y + 6. 

Alternatively, if ∠(M, N, S) is an external angle to triangle LMN. For example, extending a side. Let me think. If we extend MN beyond N to point S, then ∠(M, N, S) would be an external angle at N. In that case, the external angle would be equal to the sum of the remote interior angles. 

For example, if we extend MN to S, then ∠(M, N, S) would be an external angle to triangle LMN at N. So it would equal ∠L + ∠M. 

But ∠L is 3x + 5, ∠M is 2x + 10. So the external angle would be 3x + 5 + 2x + 10 = 5x + 15. 

But according to the third predicate, this angle is y + 6. So:

y + 6 = 5x + 15 → y = 5x + 9. Equation A.

Now, the fourth predicate says Measure of Angle(R, S, N) = 2y - 12. Let's think about this angle. If we extended some sides, maybe this angle relates to another external angle or something. 

Alternatively, if we consider triangle QRS. Since ∠S in triangle QRS is 165 -5x (as earlier), and if ∠(R, S, N) is an external angle at S, then it would be equal to the sum of the remote interior angles of triangle QRS. 

The remote interior angles would be ∠Q and ∠R. ∠Q is 3x + 5 (corresponding to ∠L), ∠R is 2x + 10 (corresponding to ∠M). So the external angle at S would be 3x + 5 + 2x + 10 = 5x + 15. 

But according to the fourth predicate, this angle is 2y - 12. So:

2y - 12 = 5x + 15 → 2y = 5x + 27 → y = (5x + 27)/2. Equation B.

Now, from Equation A: y = 5x + 9.

Set Equation A and B equal:

5x + 9 = (5x + 27)/2

Multiply both sides by 2:

10x + 18 = 5x + 27

Subtract 5x from both sides:

5x + 18 = 27

Subtract 18:

5x = 9 → x = 9/5 = 1.8. But this is not among the answer choices (A-D are integers). So this suggests a contradiction, implying my assumption is wrong.

Hmm, so maybe my assumption about the external angles is incorrect. Let me reconsider.

Alternatively, maybe the angle ∠(R, S, N) is not an external angle but something else. Let me think again. 

If we consider that ∠(R, S, N) is part of triangle QRS. Wait, in triangle QRS, the angles are at Q, R, S. So ∠S is already accounted for. But ∠(R, S, N) is at S between R and N. So if N is connected to S, then maybe that creates an angle at S that is part of triangle QRS or another triangle. 

Suppose that N is a point connected to S, creating triangle QSN. Then, ∠(R, S, N) would be part of triangle QSN. But without knowing more, it's hard to proceed. 

Alternatively, since triangles LMN and QRS are congruent, maybe there's a way to relate ∠(M, N, S) and ∠(R, S, N) through congruence. 

Wait, if we consider that ∠(M, N, S) and ∠(R, S, N) are corresponding angles due to congruence. But I need to think carefully. 

Alternatively, since ∠(M, N, S) is y + 6 and ∠(R, S, N) is 2y - 12, maybe these two angles are supplementary or something. For example, if they form a linear pair, their sum is 180. 

So:

y + 6 + 2y - 12 = 180 → 3y - 6 = 180 → 3y = 186 → y = 62. 

Then, substituting back into one of the equations. For example, from Equation A: y = 5x + 9 → 62 = 5x + 9 → 5x = 53 → x = 10.6, which is still not an integer. 

Not helpful. 

Maybe there's another relation. Let me recall that earlier, we had ∠N (LMN) = 165 -5x, which corresponds to ∠S (QRS). Also, from the fourth predicate, ∠(R, S, N) = 2y - 12. If ∠(R, S, N) is related to ∠S (QRS), perhaps it's supplementary. 

For example, if ∠(R, S, N) and ∠S are supplementary. Then:

(2y - 12) + (165 -5x) = 180 → 2y -12 + 165 -5x = 180 → 2y -5x + 153 = 180 → 2y -5x = 27. Equation C.

Also, from the third predicate, if ∠(M, N, S) = y + 6, and if this is related to ∠N (LMN), which is 165 -5x, then maybe they are supplementary. So:

y + 6 + (165 -5x) = 180 → y + 6 + 165 -5x = 180 → y -5x + 171 = 180 → y -5x = 9. Equation D.

Now, we have two equations:

Equation C: 2y -5x = 27

Equation D: y -5x = 9

Subtract Equation D from Equation C:

(2y -5x) - (y -5x) = 27 -9 → y = 18.

Substituting y=18 into Equation D: 18 -5x =9 → 5x = 9 → x=9/5=1.8, again not matching the options. 

Hmm, this suggests inconsistency. Maybe my assumptions about the supplementary angles are wrong. 

Alternatively, perhaps ∠(M, N, S) and ∠(R, S, N) are equal? Let's try that. 

Set y + 6 = 2y - 12 → y = 18. Then, substitute y=18 into Equation D: 18 -5x =9 → 5x=9 → x=9/5. Still no good. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another relationship. Let me think. 

We had earlier from the external angle assumption leading to y = 5x +9 and y=(5x+27)/2. Setting them equal gave x=9/5. But since that didn't work, perhaps that assumption was wrong. 

Alternative idea: Maybe the angles given are parts of the congruent triangles' angles. For example, ∠(M, N, S) could be ∠N in triangle QRS, which we had as 165 -5x. So:

y +6 = 165 -5x → y = 159 -5x. Equation E.

And the fourth predicate: ∠(R, S, N) = 2y -12. If this angle is ∠R in triangle QRS, which is 2x +10. So:

2y -12 = 2x +10 → 2y = 2x +22 → y = x +11. Equation F.

Now, combining Equations E and F:

From E: y = 159 -5x

From F: y = x +11

Setting equal: 159 -5x = x +11 → 159 -11 = 6x → 148 = 6x → x = 148 /6 = 74/3 ≈24.666... Not in the options. 

Nope. 

Another possibility: Maybe ∠(R, S, N) is ∠S in triangle QRS. Wait, ∠S in QRS is 165 -5x. So:

2y -12 = 165 -5x → 2y = 177 -5x → y = (177 -5x)/2. Equation G.

And from Equation E: y = 159 -5x.

Setting equal: 159 -5x = (177 -5x)/2

Multiply both sides by 2:

318 -10x = 177 -5x → 318 -177 = 5x → 141 =5x → x=141/5=28.2, still no good.

Hmm. This approach isn't working. Let me try another angle. 

Wait, going back to the beginning, maybe I made a mistake in identifying which angles correspond. Let me double-check the correspondence of the triangles.

ΔLMN ≅ ΔQRS. So the correspondence is L→Q, M→R, N→S. Therefore:

∠L corresponds to ∠Q

∠M corresponds to ∠R

∠N corresponds to ∠S

So, ∠L = ∠Q, ∠M = ∠R, ∠N = ∠S.

Given that, let's revisit the given angle measures:

First predicate: Measure of Angle(N, L, M) = 3x +5. This is ∠L (at L), which corresponds to ∠Q. So ∠Q = 3x +5.

Second predicate: Measure of Angle(S, R, Q) = 2x +10. This is ∠R (at R), which corresponds to ∠M. So ∠M = 2x +10.

Third predicate: Measure of Angle(M, N, S) = y +6. This is ∠ at N between M and S. Since N corresponds to S in triangle QRS, but how does this relate? If we consider that ∠(M, N, S) is ∠N in triangle LMN. Wait, ∠N in LMN is 180 - (3x+5) - (2x+10) = 165 -5x. So if ∠(M, N, S) is ∠N in LMN, then:

y +6 = 165 -5x → y = 159 -5x. Equation H.

Fourth predicate: Measure of Angle(R, S, N) = 2y -12. This is ∠ at S between R and N. Since S corresponds to N in triangle LMN. Wait, ∠S in triangle QRS corresponds to ∠N in LMN. So ∠S in QRS is equal to ∠N in LMN, which is 165 -5x. 

But ∠(R, S, N) is at S between R and N. If this angle is ∠S in triangle QRS, then it would be 165 -5x. So:

2y -12 = 165 -5x → 2y = 177 -5x → y = (177 -5x)/2. Equation I.

Now, from Equation H: y = 159 -5x. Set equal to Equation I:

159 -5x = (177 -5x)/2

Multiply both sides by 2:

318 -10x = 177 -5x → 318 -177 = 5x → 141 = 5x → x = 141/5 = 28.2. Not in the options. 

Still no luck. 

Wait, but maybe ∠(R, S, N) is not ∠S but something else. Let me think: ∠(R, S, N) is at S between R and N. If N is the same as the point N in triangle LMN, then S is a point from triangle QRS. So, if we consider triangle QRS, ∠S is at S, between Q and R. But ∠(R, S, N) is at S between R and N. So this is an angle that is part of triangle QRS only if N is connected to S. 

Assuming that N is connected to S, forming a new triangle or extending a side. Let's say that in triangle QRS, point N is connected to S, forming a new segment SN. Then, ∠(R, S, N) is an angle at S between R and N. This could be an external angle to triangle QRS. 

If that's the case, then ∠(R, S, N) would be equal to the sum of the remote interior angles of triangle QRS. The remote interior angles would be ∠Q and ∠R. 

So ∠(R, S, N) = ∠Q + ∠R = (3x +5) + (2x +10) = 5x +15. 

So according to the fourth predicate, 2y -12 = 5x +15 → 2y = 5x +27 → y = (5x +27)/2. Equation J.

From earlier, from the third predicate, we had y = 159 -5x (Equation H). So:

159 -5x = (5x +27)/2

Multiply both sides by 2:

318 -10x = 5x +27 → 318 -27 = 15x → 291 = 15x → x = 291/15 = 19.4. Not in the options. 

Still not matching. 

Hmm. What if the external angle is at S, and it's equal to the sum of ∠Q and ∠R? Which we did, giving 5x +15. But this leads to no solution. 

Alternatively, maybe ∠(M, N, S) is an external angle to triangle LMN, and ∠(R, S, N) is an external angle to triangle QRS. 

As before, for ∠(M, N, S) = y +6 = ∠L + ∠M = 3x +5 + 2x +10 = 5x +15 → y +6 = 5x +15 → y = 5x +9. Equation K.

For ∠(R, S, N) = 2y -12 = ∠Q + ∠R = (3x +5) + (2x +10) = 5x +15. So:

2y -12 = 5x +15 → 2y = 5x +27 → y = (5x +27)/2. Equation L.

Set Equation K and L equal:

5x +9 = (5x +27)/2 → Multiply both sides by 2: 10x +18 = 5x +27 → 5x = 9 → x=9/5=1.8. Still not matching. 

But none of these approaches are yielding a valid x from the options. This suggests that perhaps my initial assumption about which angles correspond is wrong. 

Wait, let me double-check the correspondence of the triangles. Maybe the correspondence is different? For example, maybe the triangles are congruent in a different order? Like, maybe ΔLMN ≅ ΔQSR instead of QRS? But the standard notation is that the order of the vertices indicates the correspondence. So ΔLMN ≅ ΔQRS implies L→Q, M→R, N→S. 

But maybe it's ΔLMN ≅ ΔQSR, meaning L→Q, M→S, N→R? No, that would change the correspondence. But the original problem states ΔLMN ≅ ΔQRS, so the correspondence is L→Q, M→R, N→S. 

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the angle notations. Let me recheck:

Angle(N, L, M) is the angle at L, between N and M. So that's ∠L. Correct.

Angle(S, R, Q) is the angle at R, between S and Q. So that's ∠R. Correct.

Angle(M, N, S) is the angle at N between M and S. So that's ∠ at N between M and S. 

Angle(R, S, N) is the angle at S between R and N. 

If I consider that in triangle LMN, ∠N is 165 -5x. If ∠(M, N, S) is supplementary to ∠N, then:

y +6 + (165 -5x) = 180 → y = 5x -15 + 6 = 5x -9. Wait, no:

Wait, if ∠(M, N, S) and ∠N form a linear pair, then their sum is 180. So:

y +6 + (165 -5x) = 180 → y +6 +165 -5x = 180 → y -5x +171 = 180 → y -5x = 9 → y = 5x +9. Same as before.

And for the fourth angle, if ∠(R, S, N) is supplementary to ∠S, which is 165 -5x. So:

2y -12 + (165 -5x) = 180 → 2y -12 +165 -5x = 180 → 2y -5x +153 = 180 → 2y -5x = 27. 

Now, we have:

From above: y = 5x +9.

Substitute into 2y -5x =27:

2*(5x +9) -5x = 27 → 10x +18 -5x = 27 → 5x +18 =27 → 5x=9 → x=9/5. 

Again, same result. 

But since the answer choices are integers, this suggests that either there's a miscalculation, or my assumptions are wrong. 

Wait, maybe there's a different way to interpret the angles. Let me check if I mixed up the angles. 

Wait, for the third predicate: Measure of Angle(M, N, S) = y +6. If this is ∠ at N, which is part of triangle LMN, then it's ∠N. But ∠N is 165 -5x. So:

y +6 = 165 -5x → y = 159 -5x.

And the fourth predicate: Measure of Angle(R, S, N) = 2y -12. If this is ∠ at S, which is ∠S in triangle QRS, which is equal to ∠N in LMN, which is 165 -5x. So:

2y -12 = 165 -5x → 2y = 177 -5x → y = (177 -5x)/2.

Now, setting the two expressions for y equal:

159 -5x = (177 -5x)/2.

Multiply both sides by 2:

318 -10x = 177 -5x → 318 -177 = 5x → 141 = 5x → x = 141/5 = 28.2. Still no good.

I'm stuck. Let me try plugging in the answer choices to see which one works.

Let's test option B: x=5.

Compute ∠L = 3x +5 = 3*5 +5 = 20.

∠M = 2x +10 = 2*5 +10 = 20.

∠N = 180 -20 -20 = 140.

So ∠N = 140. Since ∠N corresponds to ∠S in QRS.

Now, for the third predicate: ∠(M, N, S) = y +6. Assume this is ∠N in LMN, so y +6 =140 → y=134.

Fourth predicate: ∠(R, S, N) = 2y -12 = 2*134 -12 = 268 -12 = 256. This seems too large, as angles in a triangle are less than 180. So likely invalid.

Option C: x=7.

∠L = 3*7 +5 =26.

∠M = 2*7 +10 = 24.

∠N = 180 -26 -24 = 130.

So ∠N =130. 

Third predicate: y +6 =130 → y=124.

Fourth predicate: 2*124 -12 = 248 -12 = 236. Again too large.

Option D: x=18.

∠L = 3*18 +5 = 59.

∠M = 2*18 +10 = 46.

∠N = 180 -59 -46 = 75.

So ∠N =75. 

Third predicate: y +6 =75 → y=69.

Fourth predicate: 2*69 -12 = 138 -12 = 126. Still, 126 is plausible, but why? Where does this angle come from? If it's an angle in a triangle, it's okay. But how does this relate to the congruence?

Wait, if ∠(R, S, N) = 126, and ∠S in QRS is 75, then maybe there's a relationship. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say. But since the answer choices are A-D, and x=18 is option D, but let's check if there's a way this could work.

Alternatively, if ∠(R, S, N) is an external angle to triangle QRS, then it would be equal to the sum of the other two angles. ∠Q and ∠R in QRS are 3x +5 and 2x +10. With x=18:

∠Q = 3*18 +5 = 59.

∠R = 2*18 +10 = 46.

Sum is 59 +46 = 105. But the external angle would be 105, but the fourth predicate gives 126, which doesn't match. 

So x=18 doesn't satisfy this. 

What about option A: x=3.

∠L = 3*3 +5 =14.

∠M = 2*3 +10 =16.

∠N = 180 -14 -16 = 150.

Third predicate: y +6 =150 → y=144.

Fourth predicate: 2*144 -12 = 288 -12 = 276. Too big.

No good.

None of the options seem to work with the current assumptions. This suggests that there might be an error in the interpretation of the angle notations. 

Wait, let me re-express all the given angle measures with x=5, which is option B, and see if there's a possible configuration.

With x=5:

∠L = 20, ∠M = 20, ∠N = 140.

So triangle LMN has angles 20, 20, 140. It's an obtuse triangle.

Now, ∠(M, N, S) = y +6. If this is an external angle at N, then it would be equal to ∠L + ∠M = 20 +20 =40. So y +6 =40 → y=34.

Fourth predicate: ∠(R, S, N) = 2y -12 = 2*34 -12 = 68 -12 =56.

Now, if ∠(R, S, N) is an angle in triangle QRS, which has angles ∠Q=20, ∠R=20, ∠S=140. So ∠S is 140. If ∠(R, S, N) is 56, it could be an angle inside or outside. But how?

Alternatively, if ∠(R, S, N) is part of triangle QRS, but not sure. 

Alternatively, if ∠(R, S, N) is an angle in another triangle. But without more info, it's hard to say. 

But since x=5 is option B, and it's
