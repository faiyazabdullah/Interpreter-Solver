Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. 

So, the problem mentions two triangles: Triangle(A,B,C) and Triangle(G,H,E). There are also altitude predicates: IsAltitudeOf(Line(D,A),Triangle(A,B,C)) and IsAltitudeOf(Line(H,G),Triangle(G,H,E)). Then there are some length equalities: LengthOf(B,C) is 4.4, LengthOf(H,E) is 3.15, and LengthOf(E,G) is 6.3. The question asks for AB, given that triangle ACD is similar to triangle GEF, and there are perpendicularity conditions: AB ⊥ DC and GH ⊥ FE.

First, I'll try to visualize or sketch the diagram based on the given information. Let me note down all the points and relationships.

Starting with Triangle(A,B,C). Since Line(D,A) is an altitude of this triangle, that means D lies somewhere such that DA is perpendicular to BC. Wait, altitudes in a triangle are perpendicular to the opposite side. So if DA is an altitude of triangle ABC, then DA must be perpendicular to BC. Therefore, DA ⊥ BC. But the problem states that AB ⊥ DC. Hmm, so AB is perpendicular to DC. That seems different. Maybe I need to check again.

Wait, the first condition says A B ⊥ D C. So AB is perpendicular to DC. But DA is an altitude of triangle ABC, meaning DA is perpendicular to BC. So maybe there's a relationship between these lines?

Let me think. In triangle ABC, DA is an altitude, so DA ⊥ BC. Also, AB ⊥ DC. So AB is perpendicular to DC. Let me see if I can find relations here. If AB ⊥ DC, then AB and DC are two lines that are perpendicular. Similarly, GH ⊥ FE, where GH is an altitude of triangle GHE. So GH is an altitude of triangle GHE, implying GH ⊥ HE. Wait, because in triangle GHE, the altitude from G would be perpendicular to HE. But the problem says GH ⊥ FE. So FE must be the same as HE? Or perhaps FE is another line?

Wait, the second part says triangle ACD ~ triangle GEF. So similarity between those two triangles. Let me recall that similar triangles have corresponding angles equal and sides in proportion. Also, since they are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional.

Now, the given lengths: BC = 4.4, HE = 3.15, EG = 6.3. Wait, HE is one of the sides of triangle GHE. Let me confirm:

In triangle GHE, the sides are GH, HE, and EG. Given that HE = 3.15 and EG = 6.3. So HE is 3.15, and EG is 6.3. So HE is half of EG, since 3.15 * 2 = 6.3. Interesting. Also, since GH is an altitude of triangle GHE, then GH is perpendicular to HE. Because in a triangle, the altitude from a vertex is perpendicular to the opposite side. So GH ⊥ HE. But the problem says GH ⊥ FE. So FE must be the same as HE? Or maybe FE is another segment?

Alternatively, maybe FE is a typo? Or perhaps FE refers to a different line. Wait, the problem says "GH ⊥ FE". So FE is a line segment. But in the triangle GHE, the sides are GH, HE, and EG. Unless FE is another segment connected to point E. For example, maybe FE is a side of another triangle, but we need more info.

But the main thing is that triangle ACD is similar to triangle GEF. Let's denote the correspondence of vertices. Since it's ACD ~ GEF, the order matters. So angle A corresponds to angle G, angle C corresponds to angle E, and angle D corresponds to angle F. Wait, but the similarity could be in any order depending on the correspondence. However, usually, the order of the letters indicates the correspondence. So A→G, C→E, D→F. So AC corresponds to GE, CD corresponds to EF, AD corresponds to GF.

But let's get back to the main points.

Given that AB ⊥ DC. So AB is perpendicular to DC. Also, DA is an altitude of triangle ABC, so DA ⊥ BC. So DA is perpendicular to BC, and AB is perpendicular to DC. So maybe there's some relation between DA and AB? Or between DC and BC?

Also, considering the similarity between triangles ACD and GEF. Let's think about proportions. If two triangles are similar, the ratio of their corresponding sides is constant. Let me note that.

But first, let's look at the given lengths. We know BC = 4.4. Since DA is an altitude of triangle ABC, maybe we can use some properties here. Also, AB is a side of triangle ABC. Wait, but how does AB relate to other segments?

Alternatively, since AB ⊥ DC, and DA is an altitude (so DA ⊥ BC), maybe there's a way to express AB in terms of other lengths using similar triangles or coordinate geometry.

Alternatively, maybe coordinate geometry can help. Assign coordinates to points and calculate accordingly.

Let me try setting up coordinates. Let me assume coordinates for triangle ABC. Let me place point B at (0, 0) for simplicity. Let me assume BC is horizontal since DA is an altitude to BC, making DA vertical. Wait, if DA is an altitude of triangle ABC, then DA is perpendicular to BC. So if BC is horizontal, then DA is vertical.

But AB is perpendicular to DC. So AB ⊥ DC. Let me consider coordinates. Suppose point B is at (0, 0). Let me take BC along x-axis. Let me set coordinates:

Let’s define point B at (0, 0), point C at (c, 0), since BC has length 4.4. So c = 4.4. Now, DA is an altitude of triangle ABC. So DA is perpendicular to BC, so DA is vertical. Let me suppose that point D lies somewhere along the line perpendicular to BC at A? Wait, no. Wait, the altitude from A to BC would be the line from A perpendicular to BC. Wait, but the predicate says IsAltitudeOf(Line(D,A), Triangle(A,B,C)). So DA is an altitude of triangle ABC. Therefore, DA is the altitude from A to BC. Therefore, point D must lie on BC, and DA is perpendicular to BC. Wait, but if DA is the altitude, then D is the foot of the altitude from A to BC.

Therefore, D lies on BC. So in this coordinate system, if BC is from (0,0) to (4.4, 0), then D is somewhere on BC. Let me denote coordinates:

Let me assign coordinates:

Let’s fix coordinate system:

Let me place B at (0, 0), C at (4.4, 0). Then BC is along x-axis. The altitude from A to BC is DA, so D is the foot of the altitude from A to BC. Therefore, point D has coordinates (d_x, 0), and point A has coordinates (d_x, h), where h is the height of the triangle. Then AB is the segment from A(d_x, h) to B(0, 0). And DC is the segment from D(d_x, 0) to C(4.4, 0).

The problem states that AB ⊥ DC. So vector AB · vector DC should be zero.

Vector AB is from A to B: (0 - d_x, 0 - h) = (-d_x, -h).

Vector DC is from D to C: (4.4 - d_x, 0 - 0) = (4.4 - d_x, 0).

Their dot product is (-d_x)(4.4 - d_x) + (-h)(0) = -d_x*(4.4 - d_x) + 0 = -4.4d_x + d_x².

For AB ⊥ DC, this dot product must be zero:

-4.4d_x + d_x² = 0 → d_x(-4.4 + d_x) = 0 → solutions d_x=0 or d_x=4.4.

But if d_x=0, then D coincides with B, which would make DA the altitude from A to BC, but then AB would be the same as DA, which would imply that AB is perpendicular to DC. But if D is B, then DC is BC itself, so AB is perpendicular to BC. Which would mean AB is vertical if BC is horizontal. Wait, but in that case, yes. Alternatively, if d_x=4.4, then D is C, making DA the altitude from A to BC, which would be AC. But then DC would be zero-length, which doesn't make sense. So probably d_x=0 is the valid solution here. But wait, that would mean D is at B. Let me check.

Wait, if D is at B (d_x=0), then DA is the line from A to B, which is the same as AB. But the altitude from A to BC is AB? That would require that AB is perpendicular to BC. Which would make triangle ABC a right triangle at B. So in that case, AB is perpendicular to BC, which is consistent with AB ⊥ DC (since DC is BC when D=B). But then, in this scenario, DA is AB, which is an altitude. So that works. But then, what is the position of A? If AB is perpendicular to BC, then point A would be somewhere along the y-axis above B. So coordinates of A would be (0, h). Then AB is from (0,h) to (0,0), and BC is from (0,0) to (4.4, 0). So AB is vertical, DC is BC, which is horizontal, hence AB ⊥ DC. This satisfies the condition.

Alternatively, if d_x=4.4, then D=C, so DA is the line from A to C, which would be the altitude. Then DC would be zero, which isn't meaningful. Hence, the only valid solution is d_x=0, so D=B. Therefore, DA is AB, and AB is perpendicular to DC (which is BC). Thus, AB is perpendicular to BC. So triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at B.

So in this case, AB is one leg, BC is another leg, and AC is hypotenuse. But then, what about the rest of the problem?

Now, moving to the second triangle: Triangle(G,H,E). It's given that Line(H,G) is an altitude of this triangle. So HG is an altitude, meaning HG ⊥ HE. Also, the problem states that GH ⊥ FE. So GH is perpendicular to FE. Since HG is an altitude of triangle GHE, then GH ⊥ HE. So FE must be parallel to HE? Or FE is another segment? Wait, FE is mentioned in the similarity of triangle ACD ~ triangle GEF. So triangle GEF has vertices G, E, F. So FE is one of its sides. Since GH is perpendicular to FE, and GH is also perpendicular to HE (as altitude), that implies that FE is parallel to HE? Because if two lines are both perpendicular to the same line, they are parallel. Wait, GH ⊥ HE and GH ⊥ FE ⇒ HE || FE. Therefore, HE is parallel to FE. But HE is a side of triangle GHE, and FE is a side of triangle GEF. So FE is parallel to HE. 

Moreover, triangle ACD is similar to triangle GEF. So their corresponding angles are equal. Let me note the correspondence. If ACD ~ GEF, then angle A corresponds to angle G, angle C corresponds to angle E, angle D corresponds to angle F. Therefore, the sides AC / GE = CD / EF = AD / GF. 

We need to find AB. From earlier analysis, in triangle ABC, AB is one leg, BC is another leg, and AC is hypotenuse. Since BC = 4.4, and AB is the other leg, we need to find AB. But how?

But we also have the similarity between ACD and GEF. Let's try to express the ratios. 

First, let's find expressions for the sides of triangle ACD. Points A, C, D. Earlier, we had D=B. So point D is B. So triangle ACD becomes triangle ABC. Wait, no. Wait, triangle ACD: points A, C, D. If D is B, then triangle ACD is triangle A, C, B. So triangle ABC. Wait, but then triangle ACD is triangle ABC. So if triangle ACD ~ triangle GEF, then triangle ABC ~ triangle GEF. 

Wait, but the problem says triangle ACD ~ triangle GEF. If D is B, then triangle ACD is triangle ABC. So triangle ABC ~ triangle GEF. 

But we need to relate this to the given lengths in triangle GHE. Let me recall that in triangle GHE, HE = 3.15, EG = 6.3. Also, HG is an altitude of triangle GHE, so HG ⊥ HE. 

Since triangle GEF is similar to triangle ABC, let's consider the ratios. Let me denote:

ABC ~ GEF, so AB / GE = BC / EF = AC / GF. 

But we don't know many of these values yet. However, we might be able to find relationships using the given data.

Additionally, since in triangle GHE, HG is an altitude. Let me compute HG. In triangle GHE, HG is the altitude from G to HE. Let me compute its length. Since HE = 3.15, and EG = 6.3. Let me consider triangle GHE. Let me assume it's a right triangle? Not necessarily, unless specified. But since HG is an altitude, we can compute it using area.

Area of triangle GHE can be expressed as (1/2)*HE*HG. Also, since EG is the side opposite to angle H, perhaps we can find the area via Heron's formula or using Pythagoras if it's a right triangle. But without knowing angles, it's hard. However, since HG is an altitude, we can relate it to the other sides.

Alternatively, since triangle GHE has sides HE = 3.15, EG = 6.3, and HG is the altitude. Wait, but HG is an altitude, not a side. Let me clarify. In triangle GHE, the altitude from G to HE is HG. So HG is perpendicular to HE. Therefore, triangle GHE is divided into two right triangles by the altitude HG. Let me call the foot of the altitude as point K on HE. So HGK is a right triangle with legs HK and GK, and hypotenuse HG. Wait, no. Actually, the altitude divides the original triangle into two smaller right triangles. Let me think:

In triangle GHE, with altitude from G to HE being HG. Wait, no, the altitude from G to HE would be a line from G perpendicular to HE. But HG is the altitude, so point H is one endpoint of HE. Wait, that would mean that the altitude from G to HE starts at G and meets HE at some point, say, M. But the predicate says IsAltitudeOf(Line(H,G), Triangle(G,H,E)). So the line HG is the altitude of triangle GHE. So that would mean that line HG is perpendicular to HE. Therefore, the altitude from H? No, the altitude is from G. Wait, the altitude of triangle GHE would be from a vertex to the opposite side. If the altitude is HG, then it must be that the altitude is drawn from vertex G to side HE. Therefore, the altitude from G to HE is the line segment from G to HE, which is HG. Wait, but that would imply that G is already on HE? No, that can't be. Wait, the altitude is a line segment from a vertex perpendicular to the opposite side. So if the altitude is HG, then vertex G is connected to HE by an altitude. So vertex G is not on HE; instead, the altitude from G to HE is the line segment from G to the foot on HE. But the predicate says IsAltitudeOf(Line(H,G), Triangle(...)), which suggests that the line HG is the altitude. Therefore, the line HG must be the altitude from G to HE. Therefore, line HG is perpendicular to HE. Therefore, HG ⊥ HE. 

Thus, in triangle GHE, the altitude from G to HE is HG. Therefore, HG is perpendicular to HE. Also, as per the problem statement, GH ⊥ FE. Since GH is the altitude, which is perpendicular to HE, then FE must be parallel to HE. 

Now, since triangle ACD (~ triangle ABC) is similar to triangle GEF, and we have some sides in triangle GHE. Let me try to connect these.

Earlier, I considered that triangle ABC is similar to triangle GEF. So AB corresponds to GE, BC corresponds to EF, and AC corresponds to GF. 

But we need to find AB. Let me consider the ratio of similarity between ABC and GEF. Let me denote k as the similarity ratio: AB / GE = BC / EF = AC / GF = k.

But we need to find AB, so we need to find GE or other sides. However, we know some sides in triangle GHE. Let me think about triangle GHE. 

In triangle GHE, HE = 3.15, EG = 6.3. Also, HG is the altitude from G to HE. Let me compute HG. To do this, I can use the area formula. Area of triangle GHE is (1/2)*HE*HG. Also, the area can be computed using Heron's formula if we know all three sides. Wait, but we don't know HG. However, we can relate the sides using the Pythagorean theorem if we assume that triangle GHE is a right triangle. Wait, but there's no indication of that. Alternatively, since HG is the altitude, we can express HG in terms of the area.

Alternatively, since in triangle GHE, the altitude from G to HE is HG, and we can use the formula for the length of an altitude: 

In any triangle, the altitude h from a vertex can be calculated as h = (2 * area) / base. Here, the base is HE = 3.15, and the area is (1/2)*HE*HG. Wait, substituting, we get:

HG = (2 * area)/HE. But area is also (1/2)*HE*HG. So that gives us HG = (2*(1/2)*HE*HG)/HE = HG. Which is trivial. Not helpful.

Alternatively, we can use the fact that in triangle GHE, with sides HE = 3.15, EG = 6.3, and let me denote HG as h. Then, using the Pythagorean theorem in the two right triangles formed by the altitude. Let me denote the foot of the altitude from G to HE as point M. Then HM + ME = HE = 3.15. Let me denote HM = x, ME = 3.15 - x. Then, in right triangle GMH: h^2 + x^2 = EG^2? No, wait. Wait, EG is the side from E to G. So in triangle GHE, the altitude from G to HE splits it into two right triangles: GMH and GME. Wait, actually, the altitude divides the triangle into two right triangles. Let me rephrase.

In triangle GHE, with altitude from G to HE being GM (M on HE). Then, in right triangle GMH: GM^2 + MH^2 = GH^2? No, GH is the altitude, which is GM. Wait, the altitude is GM, which is perpendicular to HE. So in triangle GHE, the altitude GM divides it into two right triangles: GMH and GME. Therefore:

In triangle GMH: GM^2 + MH^2 = GH^2? Wait, no. Wait, the sides of triangle GMH are GM (altitude), MH (segment of HE), and GH (the side of the original triangle?). Wait, no. Wait, GH is the altitude, so GH = GM. Then, in triangle GMH, the hypotenuse is GH, and the legs are GM (which is the altitude) and MH. Wait, no. Wait, the altitude is from G to HE, so the length of the altitude is GM. So in triangle GHE, the altitude GM can be found by:

Area of GHE = (1/2)*HE*GM = (1/2)*3.15*GM.

Also, using Heron's formula, if we can compute the area. But to do that, we need all three sides. We know HE = 3.15, EG = 6.3, but we don't know the third side, which is GH. Wait, but GH is the altitude. So we need another equation. Wait, but we can also express the area using the other sides. 

Alternatively, using the formula for the area in terms of two sides and the included angle. But we don't know the angle. Alternatively, use the Pythagorean theorem in the two right triangles. Let me denote:

Let me call the foot of the altitude from G to HE as M. Then, in triangle GHE, we have:

From point G to HE, the altitude GM = h (height). Then, in right triangle GME, we have:

EG^2 = EM^2 + GM^2 → (6.3)^2 = EM^2 + h^2.

Similarly, in right triangle GMH:

GH^2 = HM^2 + GM^2 → but GH is the side of the triangle? Wait, no. Wait, GH is the altitude. Wait, GH is the segment from G to H? No, the altitude is from G to HE, so the foot is M. So GH is not necessarily a side. Wait, confusion arises here. Let me clarify:

Original triangle GHE has vertices G, H, E. The altitude from G to HE is the line segment from G perpendicular to HE. Let me call the foot of this altitude as M. So, GM is the altitude, which is perpendicular to HE. Therefore, in triangle GHE, we have:

- HE = 3.15 (base)
- EG = 6.3 (side from E to G)
- GH is not directly a side, but the altitude is GM.

Then, the length of the altitude GM can be found using the area. Also, using the Pythagorean theorem on the two right triangles created by the altitude.

Let me denote EM = x, so that HM = HE - EM = 3.15 - x.

Then, from triangle GME: EG^2 = EM^2 + GM^2 → 6.3^2 = x^2 + GM^2.

From triangle GMH: GH^2 = HM^2 + GM^2 → but GH is the side from G to H? Wait, no. Wait, GH is the side from G to H, which is not necessarily related to the altitude. Wait, this seems confusing. Perhaps I made a mistake here.

Actually, the altitude is GM, so the length of the altitude is GM. The side GH is from G to H, which is a side of triangle GHE. So in triangle GHE, sides are:

- GH: from G to H
- HE: from H to E (length 3.15)
- EG: from E to G (length 6.3)

But the altitude from G to HE is GM, which is perpendicular to HE. So the length of the altitude GM can be calculated as follows:

Using the formula for area: Area = (1/2)*base*height = (1/2)*HE*GM.

Also, the area can be calculated using Heron's formula if we know all three sides. But we don't know GH. However, we can express GH using the Pythagorean theorem in terms of x and GM.

Wait, but we have two equations:

1. From the right triangle GME: EG^2 = EM^2 + GM^2 → 6.3^2 = x^2 + GM^2 → GM^2 = 6.3^2 - x^2.

2. From the right triangle GMH: GH^2 = HM^2 + GM^2 → GH^2 = (3.15 - x)^2 + GM^2.

But we don't know GH. So unless we have more information, we cannot proceed. 

However, there's another piece of information: triangle ACD ~ triangle GEF. Earlier, I assumed that triangle ACD is triangle ABC. But if that's the case, then triangle ABC ~ triangle GEF. So, if we can relate the sides of ABC to those of GEF, we might find AB.

But we need to relate AB to the given lengths in triangle GHE. Let me think differently. Since triangle ACD ~ triangle GEF, and we've deduced that triangle ACD is triangle ABC, then ABC ~ GEF. So, the ratio of similarity between ABC and GEF is AB / GE = BC / EF = AC / GF. 

Let me assume that the similarity ratio is k = AB / GE = BC / EF. 

But we need to find AB, so we need to find GE or EF. However, GE is one of the sides in triangle GHE. Wait, GE is the side from G to E, which is given as 6.3. So GE = 6.3. 

If ABC ~ GEF, then BC corresponds to EF. So BC / EF = AB / GE. So 4.4 / EF = AB / 6.3 → AB = (4.4 * 6.3) / EF.

But we need to find EF. How can we find EF? 

Looking back at triangle GHE, since FE is parallel to HE (from earlier conclusion that FE || HE, since GH ⊥ FE and GH ⊥ HE). So FE is parallel to HE. 

In triangle GEF, since FE || HE, and assuming that triangle GEF is similar to triangle ABC, maybe we can find some proportional relationships. 

Wait, if FE || HE, then angle at E is common? Or maybe not. Alternatively, since FE is parallel to HE, and FE is a side of triangle GEF, while HE is a side of triangle GHE. 

Alternatively, since FE || HE, then the triangle GEF might be related to triangle GHE. For instance, if FE is parallel to HE, then maybe triangle GEF is similar to triangle GHE? But not sure. 

Wait, let's think about vectors. If FE is parallel to HE, then vector FE is scalar multiple of vector HE. So FE = k * HE. 

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since FE is parallel to HE, and GH is perpendicular to FE, then GH is also perpendicular to HE. Which we already knew. 

Back to the similarity between ABC and GEF. Let me recall that in triangle ABC, BC is one of the legs, and AB is the other. In triangle GEF, EF corresponds to BC. So EF is the side corresponding to BC in the similarity. 

If I can find the length of EF, then I can compute AB. 

But how to find EF? 

Since FE is parallel to HE, and FE is a side of triangle GEF. Let me consider triangle GEF and triangle GHE. 

Since FE || HE, then maybe there's a similarity or proportionality. 

Alternatively, since FE || HE, and if we consider point F, which is a vertex of triangle GEF. But without knowing where F is, it's difficult. 

Wait, but in triangle GEF, FE is a side. And since FE || HE, and GH is perpendicular to FE, which is the same as GH being perpendicular to HE. 

Perhaps we can find the length of FE using the altitude. 

Let me go back to triangle GHE. The altitude from G to HE is GM, which we denoted earlier. The length of this altitude is GM = h. Then, the area of triangle GHE is (1/2)*HE*h = (1/2)*3.15*h. 

Also, using Heron's formula, if we can find the third side GH. Wait, but we don't know GH. However, we can relate it to the other sides. 

Wait, but earlier, we had from the right triangles:

From triangle GME: 6.3^2 = x^2 + h^2, where x = EM.

From triangle GMH: GH^2 = (3.15 - x)^2 + h^2.

But we don't know x or h. However, if we add these two equations:

6.3^2 = x^2 + h^2

and

GH^2 = (3.15 - x)^2 + h^2

Subtracting the first equation from the second:

GH^2 - 6.3^2 = (3.15 - x)^2 - x^2

Expanding (3.15 - x)^2 - x^2 = 3.15^2 - 6.3x + x^2 - x^2 = 3.15^2 - 6.3x.

So GH^2 = 6.3^2 + 3.15^2 - 6.3x.

But this still leaves us with unknown x. 

Alternatively, since the sum of squares of the sides of triangle GHE must satisfy the triangle inequality, but I don't see how that helps directly. 

Alternatively, since we don't have enough information about triangle GHE, perhaps we need to relate it to triangle GEF through the similarity.

Recall that triangle ACD (~ triangle ABC) is similar to triangle GEF. Let me denote the similarity ratio as k = AB / GE = BC / EF = AC / GF.

We know BC = 4.4, GE = 6.3, so k = 4.4 / EF = AB / 6.3. So AB = (4.4 * 6.3) / EF.

But we need to find EF. How?

Maybe EF is related to HE. Since FE || HE, and FE is part of triangle GEF. Let me assume that triangle GEF is similar to triangle GHE in some way. 

Alternatively, since FE || HE, and GH is perpendicular to FE, then GH is also perpendicular to HE. So triangle GHE has altitude GH, which is perpendicular to HE. And FE is parallel to HE. 

Maybe triangle GEF is a right triangle? If FE is parallel to HE, and GH is perpendicular to FE, then GH is also perpendicular to HE. If FE is parallel to HE, then FE could be extending from E, but I need to imagine the configuration.

Alternatively, since FE is parallel to HE, and E is a common point, then FE could be extending from E in the direction of HE. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, since FE || HE, and FE is a side of triangle GEF, then the length of FE could be related to HE. For example, if there is a scaling factor due to the similarity.

Wait, but triangle ACD (~ ABC) ~ triangle GEF. So if we can find the ratio of similarity between ABC and GEF, we can find AB. 

But to find that ratio, we need to relate it to something we know. Let me think about the altitude in triangle GHE. 

Since GH is the altitude of triangle GHE, and GH ⊥ HE, and FE || HE, then GH ⊥ FE. So in triangle GEF, GH is the altitude from G to FE. Wait, but GH is part of triangle GEF? Not sure. 

Wait, triangle GEF has vertices G, E, F. If GH is perpendicular to FE, and H is a point in triangle GHE, then perhaps F is related to H? Not sure. 

This seems too vague. Maybe I need to find another approach.

Let me revisit the assumption that triangle ACD is triangle ABC. Earlier, I thought that because D=B, making ACD = ABC. But is that always true? Let me confirm.

Point D was determined to be at B, because of AB ⊥ DC. With D=B, DC is BC. So triangle ACD becomes triangle ABC. So triangle ABC is similar to triangle GEF. 

So, if ABC ~ GEF, then AB corresponds to GE, BC corresponds to EF, AC corresponds to GF. 

We know BC = 4.4, GE = 6.3. So the ratio of similarity is BC / EF = AB / GE. 

Let me write:

AB / GE = BC / EF → AB = (BC * GE) / EF.

But I need to find EF. How?

Wait, but in triangle GHE, HE = 3.15, and since FE || HE, maybe FE is a scaled version. Let me think about the altitude. 

Since FE || HE, and GH is perpendicular to FE, then GH is also perpendicular to HE. So in triangle GHE, GH is the altitude, and in triangle GEF, GH is the altitude from G to FE. Wait, but if FE is parallel to HE, then the length of the altitude from G to FE would be the same as the length of the altitude from G to HE, which is GH. So GH is the height for both triangles GHE and GEF? Not sure. 

Wait, if FE is parallel to HE, then the distance between FE and HE is constant. But since FE is a side of triangle GEF, and H is a vertex of triangle GHE, maybe there's a relation between the heights. 

Alternatively, since FE || HE, and if we consider the triangles GEF and GHE, maybe they are similar? 

Wait, if FE || HE, then angle at E is common. Let me think: in triangle GHE and GEF, angle at E is shared. But since FE || HE, then angle at E in triangle GEF is the same as angle at E in triangle GHE. Wait, not sure. 

Alternatively, since FE || HE, then triangle GEF may be similar to triangle GEH? Not sure. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to use the fact that in triangle GHE, the altitude GH is related to the sides. 

Let me return to calculating the altitude GH in triangle GHE. Using the formula for the area. 

If I can find the area of triangle GHE, then I can find GH. 

To find the area, I can use Heron's formula, but I need all three sides. We know HE = 3.15, EG = 6.3, but we don't know GH. Let me denote GH as h. 

So, sides of triangle GHE are:

- HE = 3.15

- EG = 6.3

- GH = h

Using Heron's formula, the semi-perimeter s = (3.15 + 6.3 + h)/2 = (9.45 + h)/2.

Area = sqrt[s(s - HE)(s - EG)(s - GH)].

But this seems too abstract without knowing h. 

Alternatively, using the law of cosines in triangle GHE:

HE^2 = GH^2 + EG^2 - 2*GH*EG*cos(angle at G).

But I don't know the angle. 

Alternatively, since GH is the altitude, and we have from earlier:

From the right triangles:

In triangle GME: 6.3^2 = x^2 + h^2.

In triangle GMH: GH^2 = (3.15 - x)^2 + h^2.

But GH is the side of the triangle GHE, so GH = sqrt[(3.15 - x)^2 + h^2]. 

But we also know that in triangle GHE, by the Pythagorean theorem (if it were a right triangle), but it's not necessarily. 

Wait, but if I combine the two equations:

From triangle GME: h^2 = 6.3^2 - x^2.

From triangle GMH: GH^2 = (3.15 - x)^2 + h^2 = (3.15 - x)^2 + 6.3^2 - x^2.

Expand (3.15 - x)^2 = 3.15^2 - 2*3.15*x + x^2.

So GH^2 = 3.15^2 - 6.3x + x^2 + 6.3^2 - x^2 = 3.15^2 + 6.3^2 - 6.3x.

But I don't know x or GH. 

But perhaps there's another relationship. In triangle GHE, the sum of the squares of the sides equals twice the sum of the squares of the medians, but that might not help. 

Alternatively, since GH is a side of the triangle, and we have GH^2 = 3.15^2 + 6.3^2 - 6.3x, but without knowing x, this is stuck. 

Wait, but maybe x is related to the projection of EG onto HE. Since x is the length of EM, which is the projection of EG onto HE. Wait, in triangle GHE, the projection of EG onto HE is x. 

But how does this help? 

Alternatively, since we have two variables x and h, but only one equation from the Pythagorean theorem. 

I'm stuck here. Let me think of another approach. 

Since triangle ABC ~ triangle GEF, and we need to find AB. Let me assume that AB is the side corresponding to GE in the similarity. So AB / GE = BC / EF. 

But I need to find EF. Let me consider that in triangle GEF, FE is parallel to HE. Since FE || HE, and HE is 3.15, maybe FE is a scaled version. 

If FE is parallel to HE, then the length of FE could be related to the length of HE through the similarity ratio. 

But how? 

Suppose that in triangle GEF, FE is parallel to HE. Let me imagine extending some lines. 

Alternatively, since FE || HE and GH ⊥ FE, and GH is the altitude of triangle GHE, then GH is also the altitude of triangle GEF. Wait, if FE || HE, then the distance between FE and HE is the same as the length of the altitude from G to HE, which is GH. 

But in triangle GEF, if GH is the altitude from G to FE, then the area of GEF would be (1/2)*FE*GH. 

But also, since triangle ABC ~ GEF, the area of ABC is (1/2)*AB*BC, since it's a right triangle (assuming ABC is right-angled at B). 

Wait, earlier analysis suggested that ABC is a right triangle at B, because AB ⊥ BC. So yes, ABC is a right triangle with right angle at B. So area of ABC is (1/2)*AB*BC.

And area of GEF is (1/2)*FE*GH.

Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of their areas is (k^2), where k is the similarity ratio. 

So (area ABC)/(area GEF) = k^2 = (AB/GE)^2 = (BC/EF)^2.

But also, area ABC = (1/2)*AB*BC.

Area GEF = (1/2)*FE*GH.

So (AB*BC)/(FE*GH) = k^2 = (AB/GE)^2.

So:

(AB*BC)/(FE*GH) = (AB^2)/(GE^2).

Cancel AB from both sides (assuming AB ≠ 0):

BC/(FE*GH) = AB/GE.

Rearranged: AB = (BC * GE) / (FE * GH).

But I still have FE and GH as unknowns. 

But from earlier, in triangle GHE, GH is the altitude. Let me recall that in any triangle, the length of the altitude can be calculated as (2 * area) / base. 

So for triangle GHE, area = (1/2)*HE*GH.

So GH = (2 * area)/HE.

But area can also be calculated using Heron's formula if we know all sides. But we don't know GH. 

But if I substitute GH = (2 * area)/HE into the expression for AB, I get:

AB = (BC * GE) / (FE * (2 * area)/HE) ) = (BC * GE * HE) / (2 * area * FE).

But I don't know area or FE.

This seems like going in circles. 

Wait, but maybe there's another relation. Since FE || HE, and GH is perpendicular to FE, then GH is also perpendicular to HE. So in triangle GHE, GH is the altitude, and FE is parallel to HE. So the length of FE could be related to the length of HE through the similarity ratio. 

If I consider triangle GEF and triangle GHE, since FE || HE, and assuming some similarity, but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, since FE || HE, and GH is perpendicular to both, then FE is a translation or scaled version of HE. 

Alternatively, since FE is parallel to HE, and G is a common vertex, then triangle GEF and triangle GHE share the vertex G, and have sides FE and HE parallel. So perhaps they are similar? 

If FE || HE, then angle at G is common, and the other angles are equal, making them similar. So triangle GEF ~ triangle GHE. 

If that's the case, then the ratio of similarity would be GE/GH = GF/GH = EF/HE. 

Wait, if triangle GEF ~ triangle GHE, then corresponding sides are proportional. Let me assume that the correspondence is G -> G, E -> H, F -> E. So GE corresponds to GH, EF corresponds to HE, and GF corresponds to GE. 

Wait, not sure. Let me think: if FE || HE, and angle at G is common, then the triangles GEF and GHE would have angles equal, making them similar. 

So triangle GEF ~ triangle GHE by AA similarity (angle at G is common, and angle at E is equal to angle at H because of the parallel lines). 

If this is true, then the ratio of similarity is GE/GH = EF/HE = GF/GH. 

Wait, let's say GE corresponds to GH, EF corresponds to HE. So:

GE / GH = EF / HE.

So EF = (GE * HE)/GH.

Substituting into our previous equation for AB:

AB = (BC * GE) / (FE * GH) = (BC * GE) / [(GE * HE)/GH * GH] = (BC * GE) / (GE * HE) = BC / HE.

Wait, that simplifies to AB = BC / HE.

But BC is 4.4, and HE is 3.15. So AB = 4.4 / 3.15 ≈ 1.4. But this is not among the answer choices. The options are A. 2.2, B. 3.6, C. 4.4, D. 6.3. 

Hmm, this suggests a mistake in my assumption. Where did I go wrong?

Wait, let me double-check the similarity between GEF and GHE. If FE || HE, then angle at E in GEF is equal to angle at H in GHE. Also, angle at G is common. So triangles GEF and GHE are similar by AA. 

Yes, that seems correct. So GE/GH = EF/HE. So EF = (GE * HE)/GH. 

But then, returning to AB = (BC * GE) / (FE * GH). Substituting FE = (GE * HE)/GH, we get:

AB = (BC * GE) / [(GE * HE)/GH * GH] = BC / HE = 4.4 / 3.15 ≈ 1.4. 

But this is not among the options. So either my assumption is wrong, or there's a miscalculation. 

Alternatively, maybe the similarity is different. Let me re-examine the correspondence. 

If triangle GEF ~ triangle GHE, then the correspondence could be G -> G, E -> H, F -> E. So GE corresponds to GH, EF corresponds to HE, and GF corresponds to GE. 

So the ratio is GE/GH = EF/HE = GF/GE. 

Thus, EF = (GE * HE)/GH. 

Then, in the expression for AB: AB = (BC * GE) / (FE * GH) = (BC * GE) / [ (GE * HE)/GH * GH ] = BC / HE = 4.4 / 3.15. 

But this gives approximately 1.4, which is not an option. 

So this suggests that my assumption about the similarity between GEF and GHE is incorrect, or there's another error in the logic. 

Let me reconsider the similarity between ABC and GEF. Earlier, I assumed that triangle ACD is triangle ABC, leading to ABC ~ GEF. But maybe this is not correct. 

Wait, what if D is not B? Earlier, I concluded that D must be B because of AB ⊥ DC, but let me verify that again. 

Let me go back to the initial setup. We have triangle ABC with altitude DA, so DA ⊥ BC. Also, AB ⊥ DC. 

Assuming BC is horizontal, DA is vertical. Let me redefine coordinates. Let me set B at (0, 0), C at (c, 0), so BC = c = 4.4. Point D is the foot of the altitude from A to BC, so D has coordinates (d, 0), and A is at (d, h). 

Vector AB is from A(d, h) to B(0, 0): (-d, -h). Vector DC is from D(d, 0) to C(c, 0): (c - d, 0). Their dot product is (-d)(c - d) + (-h)(0) = -d(c - d). For AB ⊥ DC, this must be zero: -d(c -
