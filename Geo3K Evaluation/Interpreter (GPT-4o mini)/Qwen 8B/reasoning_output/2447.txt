<think>
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, we need to find the value of y based on the given predicates. Let me start by understanding each predicate and how they relate to each other.

First, let's list out all the given information:

1. Measure of Angle(D, A, C) = 3y + 40
2. Measure of Angle(A, D, B) = 120 degrees
3. Measure of Angle(C, B, D) = x
4. Measure of Angle(A, C, E) = 3x - 70
5. Point D lies on line AB
6. Point C lies on line AE
7. Point B lies on line DC

Hmm, okay. Let me visualize this. Maybe drawing a rough sketch would help. Points A, B, C, D, E are involved here. Let's see:

From point 5, D is on line AB. So points A---D---B? Or maybe D is somewhere else on AB. Similarly, point C is on line AE. And point B is on line DC. Wait, so line DC connects points D and C, and point B is on that line. That suggests that points D, B, C are colinear? Because if B is on DC, then D-B-C or D-C-B?

Let me try to reconstruct the diagram step by step.

Starting with line AB, since D is on AB. Then, there's another line AE, with C lying on it. Also, B is on DC. So connecting D to C, and B is somewhere on that line. So perhaps the points are arranged such that D is on AB, C is on AE, and B is on DC. This seems like a network of lines intersecting.

Maybe I should consider triangles here. For example, looking at triangle ADC or something else. But first, let's note down all the angles mentioned.

Angle at D, between A and C: ∠ADC. Wait, the measure is given as 3y + 40. Then angle at A, between D and B: ∠ADB is 120 degrees. Then angle at B, between C and D: ∠CBD is x. Then angle at C, between A and E: ∠ACE is 3x -70.

So, trying to find relations between these angles. Since some points lie on lines, maybe there are straight lines or supplementary angles.

First, considering point D lies on AB. So line AB has points A, D, B. Therefore, AD + DB = AB. But angles... Let's think about triangle ABD. Wait, but where is point C?

Point C is on line AE. So line AE has points A, C, E. Also, point B is on line DC. So line DC connects D to C, passing through B. Therefore, points D, B, C are colinear. So line DC passes through B, meaning that B is between D and C, or one of them is extended beyond.

So, putting this together, let's imagine:

- Line AB with D between A and B.
- Line AE with C between A and E.
- Line DC passes through B, so starting from D, going through B to C.

Therefore, points D connected to C, passing through B. So, DC is a line that starts at D, goes through B, and ends at C. Which is also on line AE.

Now, considering angles:

∠ADB is 120 degrees. Since D is on AB, so AD is part of AB. So angle at D between A and B. Wait, ∠ADB would be formed by points A-D-B. Wait, but D is on AB, so the angle at D between A and B would be a straight line. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, hold on—maybe I'm misinterpreting the angle notation.

Wait, angle notation: Angle(D, A, C). So vertex at A, with sides AD and AC. Wait, no. Wait, the standard notation for angle(D, A, C) would mean the angle at point A, with segments DA and CA. Wait, no. Wait, the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(D, A, C) is the angle at point A, formed by points D-A-C. So, vertex at A, with sides AD and AC. Similarly, Angle(A, D, B) is angle at D, formed by points A-D-B. So vertex at D, sides DA and DB. Oh! So that angle is at D, between A and B. Since D is on AB, then DA and DB are parts of the same line AB. So that angle would be a straight line, making 180 degrees. But according to the given, it's 120 degrees. That contradicts unless there's more to it.

Wait, that can't be. There's something wrong here. If D is on line AB, then points A, D, B are colinear, so angle at D between A and B would be a straight angle, i.e., 180 degrees. However, the given says it's 120 degrees. Therefore, my initial assumption must be incorrect. Perhaps D is not between A and B? Wait, the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(D, Line(A,B)). So D is on line AB, but not necessarily between A and B. It could be extending beyond either end. So if D is not between A and B, but say, extending past A or past B. 

For example, suppose D is on line AB, but located such that A is between D and B. So order would be D---A---B. In that case, angle at D between A and B would be formed by DA and DB. But since A is between D and B, DA and DB are two rays from D going towards A and B. So the angle between DA and DB would be the angle at D between those two directions. If D is outside segment AB, then angle ADB would be the angle between DA and DB. For instance, if D is on the extension of AB beyond A, then DA is pointing towards A, and DB is pointing towards B. So the angle between DA and DB would be the angle at D between those two directions, which could be 120 degrees. That makes sense.

So, in this scenario, D is not between A and B but rather on the extension of AB beyond A. So the configuration is D---A---B. Then, angle at D between A and B (i.e., ∠ADB) is 120 degrees. That explains why it's not a straight line. Okay, that makes sense now.

Next, point C lies on line AE. So line AE has points A, C, E. And point B lies on line DC. So line DC connects D to C, passing through B. So points D, B, C are colinear. Therefore, line DC passes through B, so B is on DC. Thus, the line DC connects D to C, and B is somewhere along that line.

Now, let's look at the angles again.

First, angle at A between D and C: ∠DAC. Wait, the first predicate says MeasureOf(Angle(D, A, C)) = 3y + 40. So that's angle at A, with sides AD and AC. So ∠DAC = 3y + 40 degrees.

Then, angle at D between A and B: ∠ADB = 120 degrees.

Angle at B between C and D: ∠CBD = x degrees.

Angle at C between A and E: ∠ACE = 3x -70 degrees.

Our goal is to find y.

So, let's try to find relationships between these angles. Maybe using triangle angle sums, vertical angles, or linear pairs.

Let me consider triangle ADC. Wait, but do we know enough about that triangle? Not sure yet. Alternatively, since points D, B, C are colinear, and B is on DC, maybe there are some triangles involving point B.

Also, since point C is on AE, and we have angle ACE, which involves point E. But we don't have info about E except that it's on line AE. Maybe we need to find relations through other angles.

Alternatively, let's consider triangle ABD. Wait, but D is on line AB extended, so triangle ABD isn't really a triangle. Wait, but if we consider point C connected to D and B?

Wait, since B is on DC, then line DC passes through B. So, considering triangle DBC? Or maybe triangle ABC?

Alternatively, let's focus on point B. At point B, we have angle CBD (which is x), and since B is on DC, which is a straight line. Also, since B is on line AB (from earlier), because D is on AB, and B is on DC. Wait, no, D is on AB, and B is on DC. So line DC connects D to C, passing through B. Therefore, line DC intersects AB at point B.

So, perhaps there's a transversal here. Let me think about the angles around point B.

At point B, we have several lines: BA (since B is on AB), BC (since B is on DC), and BD (since D is on AB). Wait, BD is part of AB? No, D is on AB, so BD is just a segment from B to D, which is along AB. Wait, no—if D is on AB extended beyond A, then BD is the entire length from B to D, which includes BA. Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to draw coordinates.

Perhaps assigning coordinates might help. Let me place point A at origin (0,0). Let me assume coordinates for clarity.

But maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, use angle chasing.

Since angle ADB is 120 degrees. Let's consider triangle ADB. Wait, but D is on AB extended, so triangle ADB is actually a degenerate triangle if D is on AB. Wait, no. Wait, if D is on line AB extended, then points A, D, B are colinear. So angle at D between A and B is 120 degrees. But in reality, if D is on line AB, then the angle between DA and DB is 180 degrees minus the angle between DA and DB if they're in opposite directions. Wait, maybe I need to clarify.

Suppose D is on the extension of AB beyond A. So the order is D---A---B. Then, at point D, the lines DA and DB form an angle. DA is from D to A, and DB is from D to B. Since A is between D and B, the angle between DA and DB would be the angle between DA (towards A) and DB (towards B). Since DA and DB are in opposite directions relative to D, the angle between them would be 180 degrees. But the given is 120 degrees. Therefore, this suggests that my assumption is wrong. Wait, that can't be. Unless there's another line involved.

Ah! Wait, the angle at D is ∠ADB, which is formed by points A, D, B. So vertex at D, with segments DA and DB. So if D is on line AB, then DA and DB are parts of the same line. Hence, the angle between them is 180 degrees. But the given is 120 degrees, which implies that DA and DB are not colinear. Therefore, D cannot be on line AB. Wait, but the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(D, Line(A,B)), so D must be on line AB. How can this be resolved?

This contradiction suggests that my previous understanding is incorrect. Let me re-examine the angle notation.

Wait, angle notation: Angle(D, A, C) means the angle at point A, between points D and C. So vertex at A, with sides AD and AC. Similarly, Angle(A, D, B) is the angle at D, between points A and B. So vertex at D, with sides DA and DB. So, if D is on line AB, then DA and DB are collinear, hence forming a straight angle. But the given says that this angle is 120 degrees. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding. How can DA and DB form an angle of 120 degrees if D is on line AB?

Unless, wait, maybe D is not on line AB but on another line? No, the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(D, Line(A,B)), so D is definitely on AB. So this is conflicting. What's the resolution?

Ah! Wait, maybe the angle is not formed by DA and DB directly, but there's another intersection. Wait, maybe there are other lines. Wait, the problem mentions points C and E. So perhaps the angle at D is not between DA and DB directly, but due to other lines intersecting?

Wait, the angle ∠ADB is at point D, between A and B. So the sides of the angle are DA and DB. But if D is on line AB, then DA and DB are in opposite directions, hence forming a straight angle. Therefore, the only way this angle can be 120 degrees is if D is not on line AB. But the predicate says it is. Contradiction!

This suggests that there's a mistake in interpreting the angle notation. Let me double-check.

Wait, maybe the angle is not between DA and DB, but between DA and some other line. Wait, no—the notation Angle(A, D, B) refers to the angle at D between A and B, meaning the angle formed at D by the points A and B. So if D is on AB, then that angle is indeed a straight angle. Hence, the given value of 120 degrees is impossible unless there's a different interpretation.

Wait, could there be a typo in the problem? Or perhaps the angle is not formed by DA and DB, but by DA and DC? Wait, no—the angle is specified as (A, D, B), so it's between A and B at D.

Alternatively, maybe there's a misread in the problem statement. Let me check again.

Original problem says:

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D, A, C)), 3y + 40)

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A, D, B)), 120)

So, the second one is MeasureOf(Angle(A, D, B)) which is angle at D, between A and B. So yes, that's ∠ADB.

Given that, and D is on line AB, this seems contradictory. So perhaps the error is in assuming that D is on line AB in the way I thought. Let me reconsider the position of D.

Wait, maybe D is not on line AB in the way I thought. Suppose line AB is extended, and D is on the line AB, but such that A is between D and B. Wait, that still places D and B on opposite sides of A, making DA and DB colinear, hence angle at D being 180 degrees. Still impossible.

Wait, unless there's another line involved. Wait, maybe there's another line intersecting at D. For example, if there is a line from D to C, creating some other angles. But the angle in question is specifically ∠ADB, which is at D between A and B. So even if there are other lines, the angle itself remains between DA and DB.

This seems like a paradox. How can D be on line AB and have an angle of 120 degrees at D between A and B?

Wait, unless the angle is not between DA and DB, but between DA and DC? No, the angle is explicitly between A and B. So this is confusing.

Wait, maybe the problem uses a different notation, where the angle is formed by three points in a different way. Like, maybe Angle(A, D, B) is the angle at D, but formed by lines DA and DB. But if D is on AB, then those lines are colinear. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the angle is not planar? No, all points are in a plane.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the problem reading. Let me check again.

Original problem says:

- PointLiesOnLine(D, Line(A, B)): D is on line AB.

- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A, D, B)), 120): angle at D between A and B is 120 degrees.

This suggests that D is not on segment AB but on its extension, but even then, the angle between DA and DB would be 180 degrees. Wait, unless there's a third line involved. For example, if there is a line from D to C, making some other angle.

Wait, but the angle in question is specifically between A and B at D. So unless there's a reflection or something, this seems impossible.

Wait, unless the angle is reflex? But angles are typically considered as less than 180 degrees unless stated otherwise.

This suggests there's a mistake in the problem setup, but since it's a problem to solve, there must be a way. Let me try to think differently.

Perhaps the angle is not between DA and DB, but between DA and DC? No, the notation is Angle(A, D, B), so it's between A and B at D. So DA and DB.

Wait, maybe the problem is in three dimensions? Unlikely, as it's a typical geometry problem.

Alternatively, maybe D is not on the line AB, but on another line? No, the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(D, Line(A,B)).

Wait, unless there's a miscalculation in the angle. Let me consider that maybe the angle is not between DA and DB, but between DA and DC? But that would be Angle(D, A, C), which is given as 3y + 40. So that's a separate angle.

Wait, perhaps there's a triangle involving D, A, and B, with D not on AB? But the predicate says D is on AB. 

I'm stuck here. Let me try to proceed under the assumption that there's a mistake in my understanding and move forward, seeing if contradictions arise.

Assume that despite D being on AB, angle ADB is 120 degrees. Even though it seems impossible, let's proceed. Maybe there's a triangle involving D, A, and B with some other points.

Wait, if D is on line AB, and we have another point C such that line DC passes through B. So, DC is a line from D through B to C. Then, maybe triangle DBC or something else.

Looking at angle at D, which is 120 degrees. If we consider triangle DBC, but B is on DC, so that's not a triangle. Wait, unless there's another point.

Alternatively, consider triangle ADC. Let's see: point D is on AB, point C is on AE. So line DC connects D to C, passing through B. So, in triangle ADC, we have points A, D, C. We know angle at A (∠DAC = 3y + 40), and angle at D (∠ADC)? Wait, ∠ADC is the angle at D between A and C. But if D is on AB, then DA is part of AB, and DC is another line. So ∠ADC is the angle at D between DA (along AB) and DC (which goes through B to C).

So, ∠ADC is composed of ∠ADB (which is 120 degrees) and ∠BDC? Wait, no. If DC passes through B, then from point D, the line DC goes through B to C. So, at point D, the angle between DA (part of AB) and DC (going through B to C) is ∠ADC. This angle would be split into two parts: one between DA and DB (which is 120 degrees), and another between DB and DC. Wait, but if DC passes through B, then from D, the direction to B and to C is along the same line. So, ∠ADC is the angle between DA and DC. Since DC passes through B, which is on AB extended, then ∠ADC is the angle between DA (on AB) and DC (passing through B to C). 

So, if we can express ∠ADC in terms of other angles, maybe we can get an equation.

But how? Let's think. From point D, we have DA in one direction (along AB), and DC in another direction (through B to C). So the angle between DA and DC is ∠ADC, which is given as 3y + 40. Also, along DC, from D, we go through B to C. So, the angle between DA and DB is 120 degrees (given), and from B, the line continues to C. So, the total angle at D between DA and DC is the sum of ∠ADB (120 degrees) and ∠BDC. Wait, but ∠BDC is part of the line DC. Wait, if DC is a straight line passing through B, then from D to B to C, the angle between DA and DC is composed of ∠ADB (between DA and DB) plus ∠DBC (but ∠DBC is at B, not D). Wait, I'm confused.

Wait, at point D, the angle between DA and DC is ∠ADC. This angle can be broken down into two parts: from DA to DB (which is 120 degrees), and from DB to DC. But since B is on DC, the direction from D to B to C is along the same line, so the angle between DB and DC is zero? No, because DB is part of DC. So, if DC is a straight line through B, then from D, moving towards B is the same as moving towards C. Hence, the angle between DA and DC is the same as the angle between DA and DB, which is 120 degrees. But this contradicts the given that ∠ADC is 3y + 40. Hence, this suggests that ∠ADC is 120 degrees, implying 3y + 40 = 120 → 3y = 80 → y = 80/3 ≈ 26.66..., which is not among the options. But the options are A.10, B.20, C.30, D.70. So this is not matching. Hence, this approach must be wrong.

Wait, but this suggests that there's a fundamental error in my assumptions. Let me rethink.

Perhaps the angle at D is not between DA and DC, but between DA and DB, and there's another angle involved. Wait, but the given is ∠ADC, which is at D, between A and C. So, that's between DA and DC. But if DC passes through B, then DC is a straight line through B. So, from D, the line DC goes through B to C. Hence, the angle between DA and DC is the angle between DA (along AB) and DC (through B to C). This angle could be formed by two lines: DA and DC. If I can express this angle in terms of other angles.

But how? Let's think about triangle ADC. In triangle ADC, we have:

∠DAC = 3y + 40 (at A)

∠ADC = ? (at D)

∠ACD = ? (at C)

Sum of angles is 180 degrees.

But without knowing other angles, this might not help directly.

However, we also have other information. For instance, angle at C between A and E is ∠ACE = 3x - 70. Point C is on line AE, so line AE extends from A through C to E. So, ∠ACE is the angle at C between A and E. Since C is on AE, this angle is 180 degrees if E is on the same line, but that's not possible. Wait, no—∠ACE is formed by points A, C, E. So, it's the angle at C between A and E. Since C is on line AE, then the angle between CA and CE would be a straight line, hence 180 degrees. But the given is 3x -70. So this implies that 3x -70 = 180 → 3x = 250 → x = 250/3 ≈ 83.33, which also doesn't match any of the options. So this suggests another inconsistency.

This indicates that there's a misunderstanding in how the points are arranged. Perhaps the points are not in the way I assumed. Let me try a different approach.

Maybe the diagram involves multiple triangles and intersecting lines. Let's consider all given points:

Points A, B, C, D, E.

Given:

- D is on AB.

- C is on AE.

- B is on DC.

So, line DC passes through B. So, points D, B, C are colinear.

Let me try to represent this with variables. Let's denote:

Line AB: contains points A and B, with D on it.

Line AE: contains points A and E, with C on it.

Line DC: contains points D and C, with B on it.

So, points D, B, C are on the same line.

Now, considering triangle ABC? Or other triangles.

Let me think about the angles:

We have ∠ADB = 120° (angle at D between A and B).

∠DAC = 3y + 40° (angle at A between D and C).

∠CBD = x° (angle at B between C and D).

∠ACE = 3x -70° (angle at C between A and E).

Let me try to find relationships between these angles.

First, since B is on DC, and D is on AB, let's consider the angles around point B.

At point B, we have lines BA (since B is on AB), BC (since B is on DC), and possibly others.

The angle at B between C and D is x°, which is ∠CBD. So, at point B, between points C and D, which is along DC. Also, since B is on AB, there's the line BA.

So, at point B, we have two lines: BA and BC (since DC passes through B). The angle between BA and BC is ∠ABC, which may relate to x°. But we don't have direct info about that.

Alternatively, since D is on AB, and B is on DC, then line DC passes through B, so from D to C via B.

Now, let's consider triangle DBC. Wait, but B is on DC, so it's a straight line. Hence, triangle DBC is degenerate.

Alternatively, consider triangle ADC. In triangle ADC, we have:

- ∠DAC = 3y + 40° (at A)

- ∠ADC = ?

- ∠ACD = ?

But we need to find expressions for these angles.

Also, since C is on AE, and ∠ACE = 3x -70°, which is the angle at C between A and E. Since C is on AE, this angle is likely to be straight, but as before, this leads to contradictions.

Wait, unless there's a different configuration. Maybe point E is not on the same line as AE? No, the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(A,E)), so C is on AE.

Wait, maybe the angle at C is not a straight line because there's another line from C? For example, if there is a line from C to D, forming ∠ACE. Wait, but C is on AE, so line CE is part of AE. So ∠ACE would be the angle between CA and CE, which are parts of the same line, hence straight, leading to 180°. But given as 3x -70, which implies 3x -70 = 180 → x = 250/3 ≈ 83.33, which is not an option. Hence, this suggests that there's a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the angle is not between CA and CE, but between CA and some other line? No, the notation is Angle(A, C, E), which is the angle at C between A and E. So it should be between CA and CE.

This is perplexing. Let me try to consider that maybe the diagram is not planar, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe there are overlapping lines or intersections that create other angles. For example, if line DC intersects with line AE at point C, which is already on AE. So, line DC passes through B and C, which is on AE. So, at point C, lines DC and AE meet.

So, at point C, we have line DC (passing through B) and line AE. The angle at C between A and E is ∠ACE, which is formed by lines CA and CE. Since C is on AE, this is a straight line, so the angle should be 180°. But the given is 3x -70, so 3x -70 = 180 → x = 250/3, which is not an option. Hence, this suggests that there's a mistake in the problem setup or my understanding.

Wait, but the problem gives us these predicates, so there must be a way to resolve this. Let me try to think differently.

Maybe the angle at C is not between CA and CE, but between CA and CD? No, the notation is Angle(A, C, E), so it's between A and E at point C. So CA and CE.

But if C is on AE, then CA and CE are in opposite directions, making a straight line. Hence, the angle is 180°, but the given is 3x -70. So, 3x -70 = 180 → x = 250/3. But none of the options match this. So this suggests that there's an error in the problem, or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the angle is not between CA and CE, but between CD and CE? No, the notation specifies Angle(A, C, E), so it's between A and E at C.

Alternatively, maybe the angle is not a straight line because there's another line from C to somewhere else. For example, if there's a line from C to D, making ∠ACE involve CD? No, the angle is specified as A, C, E.

This is very confusing. Let me try to focus on the other angles and see if I can derive equations.

We have:

1. ∠ADB = 120° (at D between A and B)

2. ∠DAC = 3y + 40° (at A between D and C)

3. ∠CBD = x° (at B between C and D)

4. ∠ACE = 3x -70° (at C between A and E)

And the relationships between points.

Let me consider triangle ADC. In this triangle, we have:

∠DAC = 3y + 40°

∠ADC = ? 

∠ACD = ?

Sum to 180°.

But I need to find ∠ADC and ∠ACD.

Alternatively, consider triangle DBC. But since B is on DC, it's a straight line. So, no triangle.

Wait, what about triangle ABD? If D is on AB, then it's a straight line, so no triangle.

Wait, perhaps considering triangle ABD and some other triangle.

Alternatively, since B is on DC, and D is on AB, let's consider the lines and see if there are any intersecting lines creating vertical angles or supplementary angles.

At point D, we have ∠ADB = 120°, which is between A and B. If I can find another angle at D related to other points.

Since D is on AB, and C is on AE, with B on DC. So line DC connects D to C, passing through B. So from point D, line DC goes through B to C. So, at point D, the angle between DA (part of AB) and DC is ∠ADC. This angle is given as 3y + 40°. Earlier, I thought this was the same as ∠ADB, but that led to inconsistencies.

Wait, perhaps ∠ADC is composed of ∠ADB (120°) and ∠BDC. Wait, but if B is on DC, then ∠BDC is zero? No, because B is on DC, so from D to B to C is a straight line. So, the angle between DA and DC is ∠ADC, which is the same as ∠ADB + ∠BDC, but since B is on DC, ∠BDC is zero? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, if you stand at point D, facing along DA (toward A), and then turn toward DC (through B to C), the angle between DA and DC is ∠ADC. If B is on DC, then turning from DA to DC would pass through B. So, this angle ∠ADC is the same as ∠ADB + ∠BDA? No, that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe ∠ADC is supplementary to ∠ADB? If DA and DC form a straight line, but ∠ADB is 120°, then ∠ADC would be 180° - 120° = 60°, but this is speculative.

If that's the case, then ∠ADC = 60°, so 3y + 40 = 60 → 3y = 20 → y = 20/3 ≈ 6.66, which is not an option. Still not matching.

Alternatively, if ∠ADC is equal to ∠ADB, then 3y + 40 = 120 → y = (120 - 40)/3 = 80/3 ≈ 26.66, not an option.

This suggests that there's a critical error in my assumptions, but since the problem is solvable, I must have misunderstood the angle configurations.

Let me try to consider that the angle at D is not between DA and DB, but between DA and DC, and that ∠ADB is part of this.

Wait, if D is on AB, and C is on AE, and B is on DC, then from point D, the lines DA (along AB) and DC (to C via B) form ∠ADC. This angle is given as 3y + 40. Also, at point D, there's the angle between DA and DB, which is ∠ADB = 120°. But since B is on DC, the line DB is part of DC. So, from point D, the angle between DA and DB is 120°, and the angle between DA and DC is ∠ADC = 3y + 40. Since DB is part of DC, the angle between DA and DC would be the same as the angle between DA and DB, which is 120°. Hence, 3y + 40 = 120 → y = (120 - 40)/3 = 80/3, which is approximately 26.66. Still not matching any options.

But since this is not an option, there must be another relationship.

Let me think about the other angles. We have ∠CBD = x, and ∠ACE = 3x -70.

Let me consider triangle ABC. Wait, but I don't know much about it.

Alternatively, since B is on DC, and C is on AE, let's consider triangle BCE or something.

Wait, at point C, we have ∠ACE = 3x -70. Since C is on AE, this angle is between CA and CE. If we can relate this to other angles.

If I can find x, then I can find y via the other equations.

But how?

Let me try to find x using other information.

Consider triangle DBC. Wait, it's a straight line, so no triangle. But perhaps considering triangle DBC with some other lines.

Wait, at point B, we have ∠CBD = x. Also, since B is on DC, and D is on AB, perhaps there's a relation between ∠CBD and other angles.

Let me consider the straight line DC passing through B. At point B, the line DC creates an angle with AB. Since D is on AB, and B is on DC, the angle at B between AB and DC is ∠ABD, which is supplementary to ∠CBD. Wait, let's see:

At point B, the lines AB and DC meet. The angle between AB and DC at B is ∠ABD and ∠CBD. Since AB and DC are straight lines, the sum of these angles is 180°. So, ∠ABD + ∠CBD = 180°.

But ∠ABD is the angle at B between A and D. Since D is on AB, this angle is a straight line, so ∠ABD is 180°. Wait, no. If D is on AB, then from point B, the line BD is part of AB. So, the angle between AB and DC at B is ∠ABD, which is the angle between BA and BD. But since D is on AB, BD is along BA, so the angle between BA and BD is zero? No, this is confusing.

Wait, let's think carefully. At point B, we have line AB and line DC. Since D is on AB, and B is on DC, the line DC passes through B. So, at point B, the line DC is continuing from D through B to C. So, the angle between AB and DC at B is the angle between AB (which extends from B through A) and DC (which extends from B through C). So, this angle is ∠ABD, where D is on AB, and the other side is DC. So, this angle is formed by BA and BD (but BD is part of AB), so it's a straight line. Hence, the angle between AB and DC at B is 180°, which would imply that ∠ABD + ∠CBD = 180°, but ∠ABD is 180°, making ∠CBD = 0°, which is impossible.

This suggests that there's a flaw in the problem setup, but since it's a problem to solve, I must have missed something.

Let me try to consider that the angle at D is not 120°, but instead, there's a triangle involving D, A, and B with some other points.

Wait, perhaps there's a triangle ABD where D is not on AB, but the predicate says it is. I'm truly stuck.

Maybe I should try to assign variables and set up equations, ignoring the contradictions for now.

Let me assume that ∠ADC = 3y + 40, and ∠ADB = 120°. If I can relate these two angles.

Since D is on AB, and B is on DC, then DC passes through B. So, from point D, the line DC goes through B to C. So, the angle between DA and DC is ∠ADC, which includes the angle between DA and DB (120°) and the angle between DB and DC. But since B is on DC, the angle between DB and DC is zero? No, because from D, the line DC goes through B, so from D to B is part of DC. So, the angle between DA and DC is the same as the angle between DA and DB, which is 120°. Hence, ∠ADC = 120°, so 3y + 40 = 120 → y = 80/3 ≈ 26.66, which is not an option.

But since this is not an option, perhaps the angle ∠ADC is not 120°, but there's another relationship. Maybe ∠ADC is supplementary to ∠ADB? So, 3y + 40 + 120 = 180 → 3y = 20 → y = 20/3 ≈ 6.66, still not an option.

Alternatively, if ∠ADC is equal to ∠ADB, then 3y + 40 = 120 → y = 80/3, same as before.

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle where these angles are part of.

Let me consider triangle ADC. If I can find ∠ACD, then I can write the equation:

∠DAC + ∠ADC + ∠ACD = 180°

But I need to find ∠ACD.

∠ACD is the angle at C between A and D. Since C is on AE, and D is on AB, this angle might be related to ∠ACE.

Wait, ∠ACE is the angle at C between A and E, which is 3x -70. If I can relate ∠ACD to ∠ACE.

If line CD passes through B, and C is on AE, then at point C, the lines CA and CE are part of line AE, and line CD is another line. So, ∠ACD is the angle at C between A and D, which is part of ∠ACE. So, if I can express ∠ACD in terms of ∠ACE and other angles.

For example, if line CD splits ∠ACE into two parts: ∠ACD and ∠DCE. So, ∠ACE = ∠ACD + ∠DCE.

But I don't know ∠DCE. However, if I can find it.

At point C, line CD goes to D, and line CE is part of AE. So, ∠DCE is the angle at C between D and E. If I can find this angle.

But how?

Alternatively, since B is on DC, and we have ∠CBD = x, which is the angle at B between C and D. This might relate to some triangle.

Let me consider triangle BCD. Wait, it's a straight line, so no triangle. But if I consider triangle BCD, it's degenerate.

Alternatively, consider triangle ABC. If I can find angles at A, B, C.

But I don't have enough info.

Let me try to summarize what I have:

1. ∠ADB = 120° (at D between A and B)

2. ∠DAC = 3y + 40° (at A between D and C)

3. ∠CBD = x° (at B between C and D)

4. ∠ACE = 3x -70° (at C between A and E)

Let me try to find a relationship between x and y.

If I can find an equation involving x and y, then I can solve for one variable.

Let me consider the straight line DC passing through B. At point B, the line DC forms an angle with AB. Let's call this angle ∠ABD, which is the angle at B between A and D. Since D is on AB, this angle is 180°, but that's not helpful.

Wait, but if I consider the line DC passing through B, then at point B, the angle between AB and DC is ∠ABD, which is supplementary to ∠CBD. Wait, let me explain.

At point B, the lines AB and DC meet. The angle between AB and DC is ∠ABD and ∠CBD. Since these two angles are adjacent and form a straight line, their sum is 180°. So:

∠ABD + ∠CBD = 180°

But ∠ABD is the angle at B between A and D. Since D is on AB, this angle is a straight line, so ∠ABD = 180°, which would make ∠CBD = 0°, which is impossible. Hence, this suggests that my assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps ∠ABD is not 180°, but some other value. Wait, if D is on AB, then from point B, the line BD is part of AB, so the angle between AB and DC at B is ∠ABD, which is the angle between BA and BD. Since D is on AB, BD is in the opposite direction of BA. So, the angle between BA and BD is 180°, making ∠ABD = 180°, and thus ∠CBD = 0°, which is impossible.

This suggests that there's a fundamental flaw in the problem setup, but since it's a problem to solve, I must have made a wrong assumption. Let me try to think outside the box.

Maybe the angle at D is not between DA and DB, but between DA and DC, and ∠ADB is a different angle. Wait, but the predicate says MeasureOf(Angle(A, D, B)) = 120°, which is angle at D between A and B.

Wait, maybe the diagram has point D not on AB, but on another line? No, the predicate says it is.

I'm running out of ideas. Let me try to assume that the angle at D is 120°, and proceed to find x and y.

Assuming ∠ADB = 120°, and ∠ADC = 3y + 40. If I can relate these.

If ∠ADC is composed of ∠ADB (120°) and ∠BDC, but since B is on DC, ∠BDC is zero, so ∠ADC = 120°. Hence, 3y + 40 = 120 → y = 80/3. Not an option.

But maybe there's a triangle where ∠ADC is part of, and using other angles.

Let me consider triangle ADC, where ∠DAC = 3y + 40, ∠ADC = 120°, and ∠ACD = ?. Sum to 180.

So, ∠ACD = 180 - (3y + 40 + 120) = 180 - 3y - 160 = 20 - 3y.

Now, ∠ACD is the angle at C between A and D. Since C is on AE, and D is on AB, this angle
