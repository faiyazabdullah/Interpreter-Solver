====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and visualize the figure. Let me list out all the points and lines mentioned. 

Points are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. Lines are D-B, B-F, C-B, G-A, E-H. Also, there are some angle measures given. Let me note down each angle and its measure:

- Angle at point B between D and C: MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,C)) = 50 degrees.
- Angle at point B between C and D: MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,D)) = 78 degrees.
- Angle at point G between B and A: MeasureOf(Angle(B,G,A)) = 120 degrees.
- Angle at point A between G and E: MeasureOf(Angle(G,A,E)) = 56 degrees.

Also, Point B lies on line DF (since Line(D,F) is mentioned and B is on it). Wait, the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(D,F))? Wait, the original predicates have Line(D,B), Line(B,F), so maybe that's part of a straight line? Because Line(D,B) and Line(B,F) would make a straight line D-B-F. So B is connected to D and F, making line DF passing through B. Similarly, other lines: Line(C,B), so point C is connected to B. Line(G,A), so G connected to A. Line(E,H), so E connected to H. Also, Point G lies on line EH (PointLiesOnLine(G, Line(E,H))). 

So, trying to sketch mentally:

- Points D, B, F are colinear because Line(D,B) and Line(B,F) imply that B is between D and F. Therefore, line DF passes through B. 
- Point C is connected to B, forming line CB. So triangle CBD? Or perhaps another triangle?
- Point G is connected to A, forming line GA. Also, G lies on line EH. So line EH has points E, G, H in order? Since G is on EH, but we don't know where exactly unless more info is given.
  
Now looking at angles:

First angle: ∠DB C = 50°. That's the angle at B between points D, B, C. So vertex at B, with sides BD and BC. Then the next angle is ∠CB D = 78°, which is the angle at B between C, B, D. Wait, that seems like the same angle? Wait no, because ∠CBD is the angle at B between C, B, D. But since BD and BC are two sides meeting at B, those two angles (∠DBC and ∠CBD?) Wait, wait. Wait, angle DBC is formed by points D, B, C. So that's the same as angle at B between D and C. Wait, but the first angle was MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,C)) which is ∠DBC? Wait, angle notation: the middle letter is the vertex. So ∠(D,B,C) is the angle at B between D and C. So that's angle DBC. Then ∠(C,B,D) is angle at B between C and D, which is the same as angle DBC? No, wait, that would be the same angle. Wait, but the measures are different: one is 50°, the other 78°? That doesn't make sense. Wait, that suggests that there's something wrong here. Unless I'm misinterpreting the angle notation.

Wait, maybe the first angle is ∠ABC? No, the angle is written as MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,C)). So the angle is at point B, with segments BD and BC. So that's angle DBC. Then the second angle is MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,D)), which would be the angle at B between points C, B, D. Which is the same as angle DBC. Wait, that can't be. Unless there's a typo, but assuming that the problem is correctly stated, maybe there's a misunderstanding here.

Alternatively, perhaps the first angle is ∠ABD? Wait, no, the angle is (D,B,C), so vertices D, B, C. So the angle is at B between D and C. So if there are two angles at point B involving D and C, how can they be different?

Wait, perhaps the line BD is extended beyond B to another point? For example, if line DF goes through B, and line CB is another line from B. So at point B, there are two lines: one going towards D and F (so BD and BF), and another line going towards C. So the angle between BD and BC is 50°, and the angle between BC and BF is 78°? Wait, but the given angles are ∠(D,B,C) = 50° and ∠(C,B,D) = 78°. Wait, that would mean the angle between DC and BD? No, wait, the angle at B between D and C is ∠DBC, which is 50°, and the angle at B between C and D... Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe there's a miscalculation here. Alternatively, maybe the angle ∠(C,B,D) refers to the angle between BC and BD, which would be the same as ∠DBC. So if both angles are measured at B between D and C, why are they different? That implies that there's a mistake in the problem statement, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the second angle is ∠CBD, which would be the same as ∠DBC. Wait, but that would mean that the two angles are the same. However, according to the given data, they are 50° and 78°, which are different. This suggests that either there's a typo, or my interpretation is incorrect. Let me check again.

Another possibility: Perhaps the first angle is ∠ABD? Wait, but the angle is written as (D,B,C). So the three points are D, B, C. So the angle is at B between D and C. Therefore, the angle between BD and BC. Then the second angle is (C,B,D), which would also be the angle at B between C and D, which is the same as the first angle. Hence, this seems contradictory. Therefore, perhaps there's a misinterpretation here. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the first angle is ∠DBC (which is angle at B between D and C) and the second angle is ∠CBD (same thing)? But that would be redundant. Alternatively, could the second angle refer to a different configuration? For instance, if there's a line extending from B in another direction, creating adjacent angles?

Wait, considering that point B is on line DF (as per the predicate PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(D,F))), which means that line DF passes through B. So, BD is part of DF, and BF is the extension. So, at point B, there are two lines: BD (part of DF) and BC. Therefore, the angle between BD and BC is ∠DBC = 50°, and the angle between BC and BF (the continuation of DF) would be another angle. But the given second angle is ∠(C,B,D) = 78°, which would be the angle at B between C and D. Wait, but that would be the same as ∠DBC. Unless there's another line involved. Wait, maybe the second angle refers to ∠FBD? Wait, that would be the angle between FB and BD, which is a straight line, so 180° minus the angle between FB and BD. But I'm getting confused here.

Let me try to rephrase. Suppose we have point B with several lines coming out of it. One line is BD (going towards D), another is BF (extending past B to F), and another is BC. So at point B, there are three lines: BD, BF, BC. The angles between these lines would depend on their arrangement. 

Given that, the angle between BD and BC is 50°, and the angle between BC and BF is 78°, but that's just a hypothesis. However, the given angles are ∠(D,B,C) = 50°, which is between BD and BC, and ∠(C,B,D) = 78°, which would be between BC and BD. Wait, but that would imply that the sum of those two angles is 50 + 78 = 128°, which would suggest that the total angle around point B is more than 180°, which isn't possible if all lines are in a plane. Therefore, there's a contradiction here, implying that my initial assumption about the angle notation is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the angle ∠(C,B,D) refers to the angle at B between points C, B, and D, but in a different orientation. Wait, but that's still the same angle. 

This confusion suggests that perhaps I need to consider that the angle ∠(C,B,D) is actually referring to a different angle. Maybe the angle between BC and BD is being considered as ∠CBD, which is the same as ∠DBC. Wait, but that's the same angle. 

Alternatively, could there be a triangle involved where these angles are parts of larger triangles? For example, triangle BCD? In that case, the sum of angles at B would be 50° + 78°, but that would exceed the typical sum of angles in a triangle. Wait, but if those angles are part of different triangles. 

Alternatively, maybe the given angles are not both at the same point. Wait, no, the notation specifies the angle at B. 

Hmm, this is perplexing. Let me look for other clues. There are also other angles given: ∠(B,G,A) = 120°, which is the angle at G between B and A. And ∠(G,A,E) = 56°, angle at A between G and E. Also, G lies on line EH. 

Maybe I should focus on the angles given at point B first. Let's assume that there's a typo and that the second angle is supposed to be ∠(B,C,F) or something else. But without further information, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, perhaps the two angles given at point B are supplementary? For example, if the lines BD and BF form a straight line (since B is on DF), then the angle between BD and BF is 180°. If there's another line BC making an angle of 50° with BD, then the remaining angle between BC and BF would be 180 - 50 = 130°, but the given angle is 78°, which doesn't fit. 

Alternatively, if the angle between BC and BF is 78°, then the angle between BD and BC would be 180 - 78 = 102°, but the given angle is 50°, which again doesn't align. 

This inconsistency suggests that I may have made a mistake in interpreting the angle notation. Let me double-check the angle notation. 

The angle ∠(D,B,C) is the angle at point B, with segments BD and BC. So that's the angle between BD and BC. The angle ∠(C,B,D) is the angle at point B between points C, B, D. Wait, but that's the same angle! Unless there's a different configuration. 

Wait, unless the second angle is referring to a reflex angle, but that's unlikely in standard problems. 

Alternatively, maybe the second angle is referring to a different pair of lines. For example, if there's a line from B to another point, say, F, and the angle between BC and BF is 78°, then the angle between BD and BC would be 50°, and the angle between BC and BF would be 78°, making the total angle between BD and BF equal to 50 + 78 = 128°, which would mean that the line DF forms an angle of 128° at point B, which is possible if the lines aren't aligned in a straight line. But earlier, we had the line DF passing through B, so BD and BF are collinear. Thus, the angle between BD and BF should be 180°, but according to this, it's 128°, which contradicts. 

Therefore, there's a contradiction here, suggesting that perhaps the given angles are not both at point B, but that's impossible since they're both specified with B as the middle point. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should proceed by focusing on other angles and see if that helps. Let's look at the other given angles. 

Angle at G: ∠(B,G,A) = 120°, which is the angle at G between points B, G, A. So that's the angle between GB and GA. Then, ∠(G,A,E) = 56°, which is the angle at A between G and E. 

Additionally, G lies on line EH. So line EH contains point G, so points E-G-H are colinear. 

Perhaps I can find some relationships using these angles. 

For example, in triangle AGH? Wait, if G is on EH, then points E, G, H are colinear. So if we consider triangle AGE, we have angle at A being 56°, and angle at G being part of the 120° angle. Wait, but I need to clarify. 

Wait, ∠(B,G,A) is 120°, which is at point G between B and A. So that's the angle between BG and GA. Then, ∠(G,A,E) is 56°, which is at point A between G and E. 

So, at point A, we have lines AG and AE. The angle between them is 56°. Also, at point G, the angle between BG and GA is 120°. 

Maybe there are triangles involving these points. For example, triangle ABG, where angle at G is 120°, and angle at A is part of the 56° angle. Wait, but without knowing more sides or angles, it's hard to proceed. 

But perhaps the key is to use the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, or that vertical angles are equal, or supplementary angles. 

Alternatively, since the problem asks for angle 3, which I haven't seen yet. Wait, the question mentions "angle 3", but the given angles are labeled as ∠(D,B,C), ∠(C,B,D), ∠(B,G,A), and ∠(G,A,E). So angle 3 must be another angle in the diagram, possibly formed by intersecting lines or other points. 

Since the answer options are numerical, and the given angles include 50°, 78°, 120°, 56°, and the options are 52, 56, 60, 68. Maybe angle 3 is related to these numbers through some calculation. 

Wait, if I consider the angles at point B, even though there's a contradiction in the given angles, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the two angles at B are supplementary. For example, if ∠DBC = 50° and ∠CBD = 78°, then that's impossible, but if they were on different lines... 

Wait, perhaps the second angle is not at point B. Wait, no, the notation says Angle(C,B,D), which is at point B. 

Alternatively, maybe the second angle is a different angle, such as ∠FBC? If BF is a straight line from B, then ∠FBC would be the angle between BF and BC. If the first angle is ∠DBC = 50°, then the angle between BF and BC would be 180° - 50° = 130°, but the given angle is 78°, which doesn't match. 

Alternatively, if there's another line from B, say, BE, but that's not mentioned. 

Alternatively, maybe the given angles are not both at point B but at different points. Wait, no, the notation specifies the middle letter as the vertex. 

This is very confusing. Given that I'm stuck on the angles at point B, maybe I should move to other parts of the diagram. 

Looking at the line EH containing point G. So, points E-G-H are colinear. At point G, we have an angle of 120° between B and A. So, if I imagine line GA, and line GB, forming a 120° angle at G. Then, since G is on line EH, line EH extends from G through E and H. 

At point A, there's an angle of 56° between GA and EA. So, angle at A between G and E is 56°. So, in triangle AGE, we have angle at A = 56°, angle at G = 120°, but wait, no—wait, angle at G is between B and A, not directly involving E. 

Wait, the angle ∠(G,A,E) is 56°, which is at point A between G and E. So, in triangle AGE, angle at A is 56°, and if we can find other angles, maybe we can find relations. 

But without more information about the sides or other angles, it's difficult. 

Wait, perhaps using the law of sines or cosines? But without side lengths, that might not be helpful. 

Alternatively, considering that the sum of angles around point G: since G is on line EH, the line EH passes through G. So, at point G, there are lines GA and GB, forming an angle of 120°, and line GH (since G is on EH). So, the line EH continues from G through H, so the angle between GA and GH would be supplementary to the angle between GA and GB if GB and GH are in opposite directions. But without knowing the relationship between GB and GH, it's unclear. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involving points B, G, and E? 

But I'm not sure. Given that I'm struggling with the angles at point B, maybe I should consider that the given angles at B are meant to be used in combination with other elements. 

Wait, the problem asks for angle 3. Assuming that angle 3 is one of the angles formed by the intersection of certain lines, maybe in triangle ABC or another triangle. 

Alternatively, perhaps angle 3 is the exterior angle at point B, or some other angle formed by the lines. 

Alternatively, considering that the sum of the angles at point B: if there are multiple lines emanating from B, the sum of the angles around B should be 360°, but since it's a plane, the sum of angles around a point is 360°. However, if some of the lines are overlapping or colinear, the angles would add up accordingly. 

Assuming that line DF passes through B, so BD and BF are in a straight line, making a 180° angle. Then, the line BC branches off from B, forming two angles with BD and BF. 

Suppose that the angle between BD and BC is 50°, and the angle between BC and BF is 78°, totaling 50 + 78 = 128°, leaving 180 - 128 = 52° for the remaining angle, but that doesn't seem to fit. Wait, but if BD and BF are a straight line, then the angle between BD and BF is 180°. If there's a line BC branching from B, then the angles on either side of BC would add up to 180°. 

So, if the angle between BD and BC is 50°, then the angle between BC and BF would be 180 - 50 = 130°, but the given angle is 78°, which doesn't match. 

Alternatively, if the angle between BC and BF is 78°, then the angle between BD and BC would be 180 - 78 = 102°, but the given angle is 50°, which again doesn't match. 

This suggests that there's a fundamental error in the given problem, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the angle notation. 

Alternatively, maybe the angles at point B are not both on the same side of the line DF. For example, if line DF is horizontal, and line BC is slanting upwards, creating two angles: one above DF and one below. But without visualizing, it's challenging. 

Given that I'm stuck on this, perhaps I should proceed with the other angles and see if that leads anywhere. 

For example, considering triangle AGH: if G is on EH, and we have angle at A of 56°, and angle at G of 120°, then the third angle at H would be 180 - 56 - 120 = 4°, which seems too small, but maybe that's possible. 

However, without more information, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 3 is the supplement of one of the given angles. For example, 180 - 78 = 102, but that's not among the options. 

Wait, looking at the answer choices: 52, 56, 60, 68. Given that 56 is already one of the given angles, perhaps angle 3 is related to that. 

If I consider the angles at point B: if there's an error in the problem and the intended angles were different, maybe the correct calculation involves subtracting or adding. 

For example, if the two angles at B are 50° and 78°, and they are adjacent, forming a larger angle. But if they are supplementary, then 50 + 78 = 128°, and the remaining angle would be 180 - 128 = 52°, which is one of the answer choices. 

Ah! Maybe angle 3 is that 52°, which would be the remaining angle at point B. 

So, if the two given angles at B are 50° and 78°, and they are adjacent, forming a linear pair with another angle, then the third angle would be 180 - (50 + 78) = 52°, which is option A. 

But why would those two angles be adjacent? If the two angles at B are on the same side of the line DF, but that's speculative. 

Alternatively, if the two angles are part of a triangle, but I'm not seeing it. 

Given that 52 is one of the options, and the calculation fits, I'll go with that. So angle 3 is 52°, which is option A.
