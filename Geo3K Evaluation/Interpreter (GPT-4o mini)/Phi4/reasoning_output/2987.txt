To solve the problem, let's follow the structured approach outlined.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Points: \( K, B, A, C \)
- Circle: \( K \)
- Lines: \( KC, BC, AC \)

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- \( \text{RightAngle}(\angle BCA) \)
- \( \text{Equals}(\text{LengthOf}(KC), 5) \)
- \( \text{Equals}(\text{LengthOf}(BA), 2) \)
- \( \text{Equals}(\text{LengthOf}(BC), x) \)

**Relationships:**
- \( \angle BCA \) is a right angle, indicating \( \triangle BCA \) is a right triangle with \( \angle BCA = 90^\circ \).

**Specific Value Needed:**
- Find \( BC \) (denoted as \( x \)).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- Since \( \triangle BCA \) is a right triangle with \( \angle BCA = 90^\circ \), we can apply the Pythagorean theorem:
  \[
  BC^2 + AC^2 = AB^2
  \]

- Given:
  - \( AB = 2 \)
  - \( BC = x \)

- We need to find \( AC \) to use the Pythagorean theorem.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- Use the Pythagorean theorem for \( \triangle BCA \):
  \[
  x^2 + AC^2 = 2^2
  \]
  \[
  x^2 + AC^2 = 4
  \]

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

- We also know \( K \) is on the circle, and \( KC = 5 \). However, \( K \) is not directly involved in \( \triangle BCA \) except for providing a circle context.

- Since \( K \) is on the circle and \( KC = 5 \), \( K \) could be the center of the circle if \( KC \) is a radius. However, this doesn't directly affect \( \triangle BCA \).

- We focus on \( \triangle BCA \) and the given lengths:
  \[
  x^2 + AC^2 = 4
  \]

- We need another equation to solve for \( x \). Since \( K \) is on the circle and \( KC = 5 \), \( K \) might be the center, but without more information about \( A \) or \( C \) relative to \( K \), we focus on the triangle.

- Assume \( AC \) is a leg of the right triangle:
  \[
  AC^2 = 4 - x^2
  \]

- We need another relationship. Consider the possibility of using the circle's properties:
  - If \( K \) is the center, \( KA \) or \( KB \) might be radii, but we lack direct information.

- Assume \( AC \) is another leg, and solve:
  \[
  x^2 + (4 - x^2) = 4
  \]

- Simplify:
  \[
  x^2 + 4 - x^2 = 4
  \]

- This simplifies correctly, confirming no contradiction. We need to solve for \( x \) using possible values.

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- Check possible values for \( x \) that satisfy:
  \[
  x^2 + AC^2 = 4
  \]

- Possible values for \( x \) (from answer choices):
  - \( x = 4 \): \( 4^2 + AC^2 = 16 + AC^2 = 4 \) (not possible)
  - \( x = 8 \): \( 8^2 + AC^2 = 64 + AC^2 = 4 \) (not possible)
  - \( x = 12 \): \( 12^2 + AC^2 = 144 + AC^2 = 4 \) (not possible)
  - \( x = 16 \): \( 16^2 + AC^2 = 256 + AC^2 = 4 \) (not possible)

- Re-evaluate:
  - \( x^2 + AC^2 = 4 \) implies \( x^2 < 4 \).
  - Only feasible \( x \) from choices is \( x = 4 \) if \( AC = 0 \).

- Reconsider:
  - \( x = 4 \) is the only value that doesn't contradict the Pythagorean setup when \( AC = 0 \).
