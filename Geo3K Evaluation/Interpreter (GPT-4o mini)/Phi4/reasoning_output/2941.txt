PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to determine the measure of a central angle in the given geometric configuration. Let's go through the steps systematically.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

- **Geometric Shapes:**
  - Circle with center \( A \): \( \text{Circle}(A) \)
  - Square \( ABCD \) inscribed in the circle: \( \text{Square}(A,B,D,C) \)
  - Lines: \( \text{Line}(A,C) \), \( \text{Line}(B,D) \), \( \text{Line}(C,D) \), \( \text{Line}(C,G) \), \( \text{Line}(F,A) \), \( \text{Line}(F,B) \), \( \text{Line}(F,C) \), \( \text{Line}(F,D) \)

- **Measurements and Equalities:**
  - \( A, B, C, D \) lie on the circle: \( \text{PointLiesOnCircle}(\text{Point}(A), \text{Circle}(A)) \), etc.
  - \( F \) is the centroid of \( \triangle ABD \): \( \text{IsCentroidOf}(\text{Point}(F), \text{Triangle}(A,B,D)) \)
  - \( \text{Line}(A,C) \) and \( \text{Line}(B,D) \) are diameters: \( \text{IsDiameterOf}(\text{Line}(A,C), \text{Circle}(A)) \), etc.

- **Positioning:**
  - \( A, B, C, D \) are vertices of a square inscribed in the circle.
  - \( F \) is the centroid of \( \triangle ABD \).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- Since \( ABCD \) is a square inscribed in the circle, the diagonals \( AC \) and \( BD \) are diameters of the circle.
- The diagonals of a square are equal and bisect each other at right angles.
- Each diagonal divides the circle into two semicircles, and since they are diameters, they subtend a central angle of \( 180^\circ \).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- We need to find the measure of a central angle. Given that \( AC \) and \( BD \) are diameters, they divide the circle into four \( 90^\circ \) central angles at the center \( A \).
- The central angle subtended by any side of the square (e.g., \( AB \), \( BC \), \( CD \), \( DA \)) is \( 90^\circ \).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

- Since \( ABCD \) is a square, each internal angle is \( 90^\circ \).
- The central angle subtended by each side of the square is half of \( 360^\circ \) divided by 4 (since there are four sides), which is \( 90^\circ \).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The central angle subtended by any side of the square \( ABCD \) is \( 90^\circ \).
- This matches choice C.
