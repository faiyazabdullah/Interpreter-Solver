QUESTION:

====================================================================================================
PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of \( x \) such that line \( a \parallel b \). We will use the given geometric predicates to find the relationship between the angles and lines.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes and Lines:**
- Points: \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H \)
- Lines: \( \overline{GC}, \overline{FD}, \overline{CH}, \overline{AE} \)

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- \( \text{MeasureOf}(\angle DBF) = 4x + 11 \)
- \( \text{MeasureOf}(\angle EAC) = 8x + 1 \)

**Relationships and Positioning:**
- \( D, B, A \) are on line \( \overline{GC} \)
- \( E \) is on line \( \overline{AE} \) and line \( \overline{AC} \)

**Objective:**
Find \( x \) such that line \( a \parallel b \).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

Given that \( a \parallel b \), we can infer that corresponding angles or alternate interior angles formed by a transversal with these parallel lines must be equal.

- Since \( D, B, A \) lie on line \( \overline{GC} \), and \( E \) lies on line \( \overline{AE} \) and line \( \overline{AC} \), we can consider \( \overline{GC} \) as a transversal intersecting lines \( a \) and \( b \).

- The angles \( \angle DBF \) and \( \angle EAC \) are likely corresponding or alternate interior angles due to the transversal \( \overline{GC} \).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

To find \( x \) such that \( a \parallel b \), we equate the measures of the corresponding or alternate interior angles:

\[ \text{MeasureOf}(\angle DBF) = \text{MeasureOf}(\angle EAC) \]

Substitute the given expressions:

\[ 4x + 11 = 8x + 1 \]

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

Solve the equation for \( x \):

1. Subtract \( 4x \) from both sides:
   \[
   11 = 4x + 1
   \]

2. Subtract 1 from both sides:
   \[
   10 = 4x
   \]

3. Divide both sides by 4:
   \[
   x = \frac{10}{4} = 2.5
   \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

Verify the solution:
- If \( x = 2.5 \), then:
  - \( \text{MeasureOf}(\angle DBF) = 4(2.5) + 11 = 10 + 11 = 21 \)
  - \( \text{MeasureOf}(\angle EAC) = 8(2.5) + 1 = 20 + 1 = 21 \)

Both angles are equal, confirming that lines \( a \) and \( b \) are parallel when \( x = 2.5 \).

The correct answer choice is:
