PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of \(\angle P S R\) in an equilateral pentagon \(PQRST\) inscribed in circle \(\odot U\).

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

- **Geometric Shapes:**
  - Circle \(\odot U\)
  - Points \(P, Q, R, S, T\) on circle \(\odot U\)
  - Pentagon \(PQRST\)

- **Measurements and Equalities:**
  - \(PQRST\) is an equilateral pentagon, meaning all sides are equal and all internal angles are equal.

- **Positioning:**
  - Points \(P, Q, R, S, T\) lie on circle \(\odot U\).

- **Special Constructions:**
  - Since \(PQRST\) is inscribed in \(\odot U\), it is a cyclic pentagon.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- **Key Relationships:**
  - In a regular pentagon, each internal angle is \(\frac{(5-2) \times 180^\circ}{5} = 108^\circ\).
  - The central angles subtended by each side of the pentagon are equal and sum to \(360^\circ\). Therefore, each central angle is \(\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ\).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- **Objective:**
  - Find \(\angle P S R\).

- **Approach:**
  - Since \(PQRST\) is a regular pentagon inscribed in \(\odot U\), consider the central angles and the properties of inscribed angles.
  - \(\angle P S R\) is an inscribed angle subtending arc \(PR\).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

- **Central Angle Calculation:**
  - The central angle \(\angle POR\) subtending arc \(PR\) is \(2 \times 72^\circ = 144^\circ\) because \(P\) and \(R\) are separated by one vertex \(Q\).

- **Inscribed Angle Calculation:**
  - The inscribed angle \(\angle P S R\) is half of the central angle \(\angle POR\) that subtends the same arc \(PR\).
  - Therefore, \(\angle P S R = \frac{144^\circ}{2} = 72^\circ\).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- **Verification:**
  - The calculation aligns with the properties of inscribed angles and central angles in a circle.
  - The measure \(\angle P S R = 72^\circ\) is consistent with the geometry of a regular pentagon inscribed in a circle.

- **Answer Selection:**
  - The calculated measure of \(\angle P S R\) is \(72^\circ\).
