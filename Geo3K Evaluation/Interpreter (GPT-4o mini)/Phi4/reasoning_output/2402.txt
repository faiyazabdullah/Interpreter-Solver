PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's follow the step-by-step solution process:

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric shapes and elements:**
- Circle O with radius 13 inches.
- Radius \( OB \) perpendicular to chord \( CD \).
- Chord \( CD \) is 24 inches long.

**Specific value to find:**
- \( OX \), where \( X \) is the midpoint of chord \( CD \).

**Geometric theorems and properties:**
- A radius perpendicular to a chord bisects the chord.
- The Pythagorean theorem may be applicable in right triangles.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

**Key relationships:**
- Since \( OB \) is perpendicular to \( CD \), it bisects \( CD \). Therefore, \( CX = XD = \frac{CD}{2} = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \) inches.
- Triangle \( OXC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle OXC = 90^\circ \).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

**Solution path:**
- Use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \( OXC \) to find \( OX \).
- Known values: \( OC = 13 \) inches (radius), \( CX = 12 \) inches.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

**Applying the Pythagorean theorem:**
\[
OC^2 = OX^2 + CX^2
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
13^2 = OX^2 + 12^2
\]
\[
169 = OX^2 + 144
\]
Solve for \( OX^2 \):
\[
OX^2 = 169 - 144 = 25
\]
\[
OX = \sqrt{25} = 5
\]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

**Verification:**
- The calculations are consistent with the properties of a circle and the Pythagorean theorem.
- The value \( OX = 5 \) is logical given the constraints.

**Answer selection:**
- The calculated value \( OX = 5 \) matches choice A.
