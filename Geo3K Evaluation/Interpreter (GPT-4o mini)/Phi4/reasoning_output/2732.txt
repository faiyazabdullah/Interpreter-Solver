PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, let's follow the structured approach outlined:

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Circle with center O and radius 6 inches, inscribed with Quadrilateral ABCD, which is a square.
- Square ABCD has vertices A, B, C, D.
- Lines AB, BC, CD, and DA are sides of the square.
- Diagonals AC and BD intersect at point E.

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- Radius of circle = 6 inches.
- Length of chord AE = 6 inches (from the predicate).
- Diagonals of a square are equal and bisect each other at right angles.

**Relationships:**
- E lies on the diagonal AC and is the midpoint of AC and BD.
- AC and BD are diagonals of the square and are also diameters of the circle.

**What We Need to Find:**
- Length of the side of the square.

**Special Geometric Theorems:**
- Diagonals of a square are equal and bisect each other at 90 degrees.
- In a circle, the diameter is the longest chord.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- Since ABCD is a square inscribed in the circle, its diagonals are diameters of the circle.
- The length of each diagonal (diameter of the circle) is twice the radius of the circle.
- Therefore, AC = BD = 2 * 6 = 12 inches.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- Use the relationship between the side of the square and its diagonal.
- In a square, if the side length is \( s \), the diagonal \( d \) is given by \( d = s\sqrt{2} \).
- We know \( d = 12 \) inches from the diameter of the circle.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. Set up the equation for the diagonal of the square:
   \[
   s\sqrt{2} = 12
   \]

2. Solve for \( s \):
   \[
   s = \frac{12}{\sqrt{2}}
   \]

3. Simplify the expression:
   \[
   s = \frac{12 \times \sqrt{2}}{2} = 6\sqrt{2}
   \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The calculated side length of the square is \( 6\sqrt{2} \).
- Compare this with the answer choices:
  - A. \(\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}\)
  - B. \(3\sqrt{2}\)
  - C. \(6\sqrt{2}\)
  - D. \(12\sqrt{2}\)

The correct answer matches choice C.
