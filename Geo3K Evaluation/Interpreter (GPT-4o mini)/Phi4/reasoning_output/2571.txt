PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given geometric predicates and find the value of \( x \).

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes and Points:**
- We have a circle \( C \).
- Points \( E, F, H, \) and \( G \) lie on circle \( C \).

**Angles:**
- \( \angle EHF \) and \( \angle FGE \) are angles with given measures.
- \( \text{Measure of } \angle EHF = 8x + 6 \)
- \( \text{Measure of } \angle FGE = 10x - 4 \)

**Positioning:**
- All points \( E, F, H, \) and \( G \) lie on the circle \( C \).

**Objective:**
- Find the value of \( x \).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

Since all points \( E, F, H, \) and \( G \) lie on the circle, \( \angle EHF \) and \( \angle FGE \) are inscribed angles. An important property of inscribed angles is that the sum of opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral (a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle) is \( 180^\circ \).

Thus, we have:
\[
\angle EHF + \angle FGE = 180^\circ
\]

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

Substitute the expressions for the measures of the angles into the equation:
\[
(8x + 6) + (10x - 4) = 180
\]

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

Combine like terms:
\[
8x + 10x + 6 - 4 = 180
\]

Simplify:
\[
18x + 2 = 180
\]

Subtract 2 from both sides:
\[
18x = 178
\]

Divide both sides by 18 to solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{178}{18}
\]

Simplify the fraction:
\[
x = \frac{89}{9} \approx 9.8889
\]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

The calculated value of \( x \approx 9.8889 \) is not exactly one of the provided answer choices. However, we need to select the closest reasonable option from the given choices:

- A. 1.8
- B. 5
- C. 46
- D. 90

The closest value to \( 9.8889 \) is not directly listed, but considering the options, none are particularly close. However, since the problem might expect a simple integer or a common mistake in simplification, let's re-evaluate the arithmetic:

Recalculate:
\[
x = \frac{178}{18} = \frac{89}{9} \approx 9.8889
\]

Given the options, the closest reasonable choice considering potential rounding or simplification errors is not directly apparent. However, \( x = 10 \) is a common simplification error when dealing with fractions like \( \frac{89}{9} \).

Thus, the closest reasonable choice is \( x = 10 \), which is not listed, but the closest integer approximation based on typical errors would be:

Final Answer: B (as 5 is the closest integer option, but logically \( x \approx 10 \) should be considered if available).
