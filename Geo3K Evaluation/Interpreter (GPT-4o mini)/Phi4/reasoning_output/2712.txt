### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Points: A, B, C, D, E
- Lines: AD, AE, DB, EC, BC
- Triangles: Triangle ABC, Triangle ADE

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- DB = 24
- AE = 3
- EC = 18

**Relationships:**
- Angles: Angle ADE, Angle BDA, Angle CEA

**Specific Value to Find:**
- We are asked to find the length of AD.

**Relevant Theorems/Concepts:**
- The problem involves triangles and segments, suggesting the use of the intercept theorem (also known as the basic proportionality theorem) or similar triangles.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

**Key Relationships:**
- Since D and E are points on lines AD and AE respectively, and considering the lines DB and EC, we can explore the intercept theorem.
- The intercept theorem states that if two lines are cut by a pair of parallel lines, the segments created on one line are proportional to the segments on the other line.

**Application:**
- We have Line AD intersecting Line DB at D and Line AE intersecting Line EC at E.
- We can apply the intercept theorem to triangles ADE and BDC.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

**Intercept Theorem Application:**
- According to the intercept theorem, for triangles ADE and BDC, the following proportion holds:
  \[
  \frac{AD}{DB} = \frac{AE}{EC}
  \]

**Substitute Known Values:**
- Substitute the known values into the proportion:
  \[
  \frac{AD}{24} = \frac{3}{18}
  \]

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

**Solve the Proportion:**
- Simplify the right side of the equation:
  \[
  \frac{3}{18} = \frac{1}{6}
  \]
- Set up the equation:
  \[
  \frac{AD}{24} = \frac{1}{6}
  \]
- Cross-multiply to solve for AD:
  \[
  6 \times AD = 24 \times 1
  \]
  \[
  6 \times AD = 24
  \]
  \[
  AD = \frac{24}{6}
  \]
  \[
  AD = 4
  \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

**Verification:**
- The calculation is consistent with the intercept theorem and the given values.
- The calculated length AD = 4 is a reasonable result given the proportionality.

**Answer Selection:**
- Compare with the answer choices: A. 3, B. 4, C. 6, D. 8
- The correct answer is B.

Final Answer: B
