QUESTION:
A square is inscribed in a circle of area 18 \pi square units. Find the length of a side of the square.

CHOICES:
A. 3
B. 3 \sqrt 2
C. 6
D. 6 \sqrt 2

====================================================================================================
PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to determine the side length of a square inscribed in a circle with a known area. We'll approach this systematically using the provided predicates and known geometric principles.

### Step 1: Predicate Analysis and Setup

**Geometric Shapes and Properties:**
- A square \( E, C, B, D \) is inscribed in a circle \( O \).
- The circle has an area of \( 18\pi \) square units.

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- The area of the circle gives us information about its radius.

**Positioning:**
- The diagonals of the square are lines \( EB \) and \( CD \).
- The center of the circle \( O \) lies on the diagonals of the square.

### Step 2: Constraint Synthesis

From the area of the circle, we can find the radius:
- The area of the circle is given by \( \pi r^2 = 18\pi \).
- Solving for \( r \), we have:
  \[
  r^2 = 18 \implies r = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}
  \]

**Key Relationships:**
- The diagonals of the square are diameters of the circle.
- The length of a diagonal of the square is twice the radius of the circle.

### Step 3: Solution Strategy

To find the side length of the square, we use the relationship between the diagonal and the side of a square:
- If \( s \) is the side length of the square, then the diagonal \( d \) is given by:
  \[
  d = s\sqrt{2}
  \]
- Since the diagonal is also the diameter of the circle, we have:
  \[
  d = 2r = 2 \times 3\sqrt{2} = 6\sqrt{2}
  \]

### Step 4: Mathematical Derivation

Set the expressions for the diagonal equal:
\[
s\sqrt{2} = 6\sqrt{2}
\]

Solve for \( s \):
\[
s = 6
\]

### Step 5: Verification and Answer Selection

The calculated side length of the square is 6, which matches one of the answer choices.
