To solve the problem, we need to find the value of \( x \) such that the triangles \( \triangle WTY \) and \( \triangle T W Y \) are congruent.

### Step 1: Predicate Analysis and Setup

**Geometric Shapes and Relationships:**
- Points: \( T, W, X, Y \)
- Circle: Centered at \( X \)
- Lines: \( \overline{TX}, \overline{XW}, \overline{XY} \)

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- \( \angle TX Y = 4x \)
- \( \angle WXY = 2x + 10 \)

**Congruence Requirement:**
- \( \triangle WTY \cong \triangle TWY \)

### Step 2: Constraint Synthesis

**Congruence Conditions:**
For triangles \( \triangle WTY \) and \( \triangle TWY \) to be congruent, they must satisfy one of the congruence criteria (SSS, SAS, ASA, AAS, or HL).

**Key Observations:**
- Both triangles share side \( \overline{TY} \).
- They have a common angle \( \angle WTY = \angle TWY \) since they are the same angle.

### Step 3: Solution Strategy

To ensure congruence, we can use the Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) criterion. We already have:
- \( \overline{TY} \) as a common side.
- \( \angle WTY = \angle TWY \).

We need to ensure that the angles adjacent to \( \overline{TY} \) are equal:
- \( \angle TX Y = 4x \)
- \( \angle WXY = 2x + 10 \)

Since \( X \) is on the circle and \( \overline{XY} \) is a line through the center, \( \angle TX Y + \angle WXY = 180^\circ \) (linear pair).

### Step 4: Mathematical Derivation

Set up the equation based on the linear pair:
\[
4x + (2x + 10) = 180
\]

Simplify and solve for \( x \):
\[
6x + 10 = 180
\]
\[
6x = 170
\]
\[
x = \frac{170}{6} = \frac{85}{3} \approx 28.33
\]

This value does not match any of the answer choices, indicating a need to reassess the congruence condition.

### Re-evaluation for Congruence

Since \( \angle TX Y + \angle WXY = 180^\circ \) is correct, let's consider the possibility of using the supplementary angles to find a congruent setup.

For \( \triangle WTY \cong \triangle TWY \), the angles \( \angle TWY \) and \( \angle WTY \) must be equal, which implies:
\[
4x = 2x + 10
\]

Solve for \( x \):
\[
4x = 2x + 10
\]
\[
2x = 10
\]
\[
x = 5
\]

### Step 5: Verification and Answer Selection

Verify:
- If \( x = 5 \), then \( \angle TX Y = 4 \times 5 = 20^\circ \) and \( \angle WXY = 2 \times 5 + 10 = 20^\circ \).
- \( \angle TX Y = \angle WXY \), satisfying the ASA condition for congruence.

Thus, the correct value of \( x \) is 5.
