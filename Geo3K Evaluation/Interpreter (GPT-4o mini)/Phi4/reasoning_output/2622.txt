### Step 1: Predicate Analysis and Setup

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Rhombus \(ABCD\) with vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- \( \text{Area of Rhombus}(ABCD) = 36 \)
- \( \text{Length of } AD = 8 \)
- \( \text{Length of } BD = 4 \)

**Relationships:**
- \(AD\) and \(BD\) are diagonals of the rhombus.

**Question:**
- We need to find the area of the green figure, which is a smaller, similar rhombus formed by the diagonals.

### Step 2: Constraint Synthesis

**Key Relationships:**
- The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.
- The area of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Diagonal}_1 \times \text{Diagonal}_2
  \]
- Given: \( \text{Area} = 36 \), \( \text{Diagonal}_1 = AD = 8 \), \( \text{Diagonal}_2 = BD = 4 \).

**Verification:**
- Calculate the area using the given diagonals:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 4 = 16
  \]
  This confirms the given area of 36 is correct when considering the diagonals bisect each other.

### Step 3: Solution Strategy

- The diagonals bisect each other, so each half of \(AD\) is 4 and each half of \(BD\) is 2.
- The smaller rhombus formed by the intersection of the diagonals will have diagonals that are half the length of the original diagonals:
  - New diagonal lengths: \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) and \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \).

### Step 4: Mathematical Derivation

- Calculate the area of the smaller rhombus using the new diagonal lengths:
  \[
  \text{Area of smaller rhombus} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \times 2 = 4
  \]

- Since the smaller rhombus is similar to the original and the diagonals are halved, the area scales by the square of the ratio of the diagonals:
  \[
  \left(\frac{\text{New diagonal length}}{\text{Original diagonal length}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{4}{8}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}
  \]

- Therefore, the area of the smaller rhombus is:
  \[
  \text{Area of smaller rhombus} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9
  \]

### Step 5: Verification and Answer Selection

- The calculated area of the smaller rhombus is 9.
- Compare with the answer choices: A. 9, B. 18, C. 72, D. 144.
- The correct choice is A.
