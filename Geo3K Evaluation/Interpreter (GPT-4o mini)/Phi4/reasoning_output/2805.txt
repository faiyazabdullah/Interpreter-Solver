To solve this problem, we'll follow the structured approach outlined in the steps.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

- **Geometric Shapes**: We have a circle \(\odot O\) with diameters \(EC\) and \(AB\). Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\), \(E\), and \(F\) lie on the circle.
- **Measurements and Equalities**: \(\angle BOD \cong \angle DOE \cong \angle EOF \cong \angle FOA\). These are central angles.
- **Positioning**: \(E\) and \(C\) are endpoints of a diameter, and \(A\) and \(B\) are endpoints of another diameter, implying \(O\) is the center of the circle.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- Since \(EC\) and \(AB\) are diameters, they intersect at the center \(O\).
- The angles \(\angle BOD\), \(\angle DOE\), \(\angle EOF\), and \(\angle FOA\) are equal and sum up to \(360^\circ\) because they are central angles around point \(O\).
- Therefore, each angle measures \(\frac{360^\circ}{4} = 90^\circ\).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- We need to find \(m \widehat{AE}\), which is the measure of the arc \(AE\).
- Since \(A\) and \(E\) are on the circle and \(O\) is the center, \(\angle AOE\) is a central angle.
- \(\angle AOE\) is composed of \(\angle AOF + \angle FOE\).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

- \(\angle AOF = 90^\circ\) (as derived from the equal division of \(360^\circ\)).
- \(\angle FOE = 90^\circ\) (for the same reason).
- Therefore, \(\angle AOE = \angle AOF + \angle FOE = 90^\circ + 90^\circ = 180^\circ\).

The measure of the arc \(AE\) is equal to the measure of the central angle \(\angle AOE\), which is \(180^\circ\).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The calculated measure of arc \(AE\) is \(180^\circ\).
- Comparing this with the answer choices, the correct choice is \(C. 180\).
