### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Circle with center \( D \).
- Pentagon \( A, E, C, I, F \).

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- \( \text{IsRadiusOf(Line(D,I),Circle(D))} \)
- \( \text{Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,I)), 10)} \): The radius of the circle \( D \) is 10 units.

**Relationships:**
- \( I \) is a point on the circle.

**Specific Value to Find:**
- The area of the shaded region formed by the circle and the regular pentagon.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

**Key Relationships:**
- The circle has radius 10, so its area is \( \pi \times 10^2 = 100\pi \).
- The pentagon is regular, meaning all its sides and angles are equal.
- The pentagon is inscribed in the circle, as point \( I \) is on the circle and part of the pentagon.

**Relevant Theorems and Properties:**
- Area of a regular pentagon with side length \( s \) is given by:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{5(5 + 2\sqrt{5})} s^2
  \]
- For a regular pentagon inscribed in a circle, the side length \( s \) can be found using the formula:
  \[
  s = 2 \times r \times \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right)
  \]
  where \( r \) is the radius of the circle.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

1. Calculate the side length \( s \) of the pentagon using the radius of the circle.
2. Calculate the area of the regular pentagon using the side length \( s \).
3. Subtract the area of the pentagon from the area of the circle to find the area of the shaded region.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Calculate the side length \( s \):**
   \[
   s = 2 \times 10 \times \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right)
   \]
   \[
   s \approx 20 \times 0.5878 \approx 11.756
   \]

2. **Calculate the area of the pentagon:**
   \[
   \text{Area of Pentagon} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{5(5 + 2\sqrt{5})} \times (11.756)^2
   \]
   \[
   \approx \frac{1}{4} \times 6.8819 \times 138.176 \approx 237.764
   \]

3. **Calculate the area of the circle:**
   \[
   \text{Area of Circle} = 100\pi \approx 314.159
   \]

4. **Calculate the area of the shaded region:**
   \[
   \text{Area of Shaded Region} = 314.159 - 237.764 \approx 76.395
   \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The calculated area of the shaded region is approximately 76.4.
- Compare this with the answer choices:
  - A. 76.4
  - B. 237.8
  - C. 266.6
  - D. 314.2

The closest match is choice A.
