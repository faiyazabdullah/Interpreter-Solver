QUESTION:
m \angle 4 = 42. Find m \angle 7.

CHOICES:
A. 42
B. 48
C. 132
D. 138

====================================================================================================
PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to determine the measure of \(\angle 7\) given that \(m \angle 4 = 42^\circ\). The problem likely involves parallel lines and a transversal, as these are common scenarios where angle measures are related in this way.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

- **Geometric Shapes and Relationships**: We likely have two parallel lines cut by a transversal, forming several angles.
- **Measurements and Equalities**: We know \(m \angle 4 = 42^\circ\).
- **Objective**: Find \(m \angle 7\).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- **Parallel Lines and Transversal**: If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, several angle relationships are established:
  - Corresponding angles are equal.
  - Alternate interior angles are equal.
  - Consecutive interior angles are supplementary.

- **Identify Relationships**:
  - If \(\angle 4\) and \(\angle 7\) are corresponding angles, then \(m \angle 7 = m \angle 4 = 42^\circ\).
  - If \(\angle 4\) and \(\angle 7\) are alternate interior angles, then \(m \angle 7 = m \angle 4 = 42^\circ\).
  - If \(\angle 4\) and \(\angle 7\) are consecutive interior angles, then \(m \angle 4 + m \angle 7 = 180^\circ\).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

Given the typical setup of parallel lines and a transversal, we will explore the possibility that \(\angle 4\) and \(\angle 7\) are either corresponding or alternate interior angles, which would make them equal. If they are consecutive interior angles, they would be supplementary.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

- **Case 1**: If \(\angle 4\) and \(\angle 7\) are corresponding or alternate interior angles:
  \[
  m \angle 7 = m \angle 4 = 42^\circ
  \]

- **Case 2**: If \(\angle 4\) and \(\angle 7\) are consecutive interior angles:
  \[
  m \angle 4 + m \angle 7 = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  42^\circ + m \angle 7 = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  m \angle 7 = 180^\circ - 42^\circ = 138^\circ
  \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- **Verification**: Check which scenario fits the given answer choices.
  - \(m \angle 7 = 42^\circ\) is a possible answer.
  - \(m \angle 7 = 138^\circ\) is also a possible answer.

Given the answer choices:
- A. 42
- B. 48
- C. 132
- D. 138

The possible values for \(m \angle 7\) are 42 and 138. Since both are valid depending on the configuration, and 138 is one of the answer choices, we select it as the most likely intended answer based on typical angle relationships in such problems.
