Let's tackle the problem step-by-step using the given predicates and our knowledge of geometry.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes and Points:**
- Circle(O) is a circle with center O.
- Points K, G, F, J, H, P lie on Circle(O).
- Points L, N lie on lines through K, G and H, J respectively.

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- Right angles at Angle(K, L, G) and Angle(H, N, J).
- Lengths given: FL = 24, HJ = 48.
- Angle measure given: m∠HP = 65°.

**Relationships:**
- Right angles imply perpendicularity: KL ⊥ LG, HN ⊥ NJ.
- Points on lines and circles: L lies on Line(KG), N lies on Line(HJ).

**Objective:**
We need to find the length FG in circle M.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

**Key Relationships:**
- Since K, G, F, J, H, P lie on Circle(O), they form chords.
- Right angles indicate that lines through L and N are tangents at points K and G, and H and J respectively.
- FL and HJ are segments related to these tangents and chords.

**Circle Properties:**
- FL is a tangent segment from F to point L on line KG.
- HJ is a chord of the circle.
- The angle m∠HP = 65° is an inscribed angle.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

**Theorems and Properties:**
- The Power of a Point theorem can relate tangents and chords.
- Inscribed angle theorem: m∠HP = 65° implies arc HP is 130°.
- Chord properties: Chords equidistant from the center are equal.

**Plan:**
1. Use the Power of a Point theorem to relate FL and FG.
2. Analyze the circle's symmetry and properties to find FG.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

**Power of a Point:**
- For point F, the power of the point is given by \( FL^2 = FG \cdot FK \).
- We know FL = 24.

**Chord Properties:**
- Since HJ = 48 and is a chord, and given the symmetry and properties of the circle, we can infer relationships between other chords.
- If FG is a chord, and given the symmetry and properties of the circle, FG might be equal to another chord due to equal distances from the center.

**Inscribed Angle:**
- m∠HP = 65° implies arc HP = 130°.
- This doesn't directly give FG, but it confirms the circle's configuration.

**Using Symmetry and Chord Properties:**
- Given the symmetry and properties of the circle, and the fact that FL = 24, we can infer that FG might be equal to another known length due to symmetry.
- Since HJ = 48 and is a chord, and given the symmetry, FG could be equal to HJ.

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

**Verification:**
- Check if FG = HJ = 48 satisfies all conditions.
- Given the symmetry and properties, FG = 48 is a reasonable conclusion.

**Answer Selection:**
- The closest match to our derived length is 48.
