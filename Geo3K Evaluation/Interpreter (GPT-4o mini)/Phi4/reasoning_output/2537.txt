PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:

To solve the problem, let's follow the step-by-step solution process outlined.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Circle \( F \)
- Points \( A, B, C, D \) lie on circle \( F \)

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- \( \angle BFC = 72^\circ \)
- \( \angle AFD = 4a - 1 \)
- \( \angle AFB = 2a - 5 \)

**Relationships and Positioning:**
- \( \angle BFC \) and \( \angle AFD \) are central angles.
- \( A \) and \( C \) are endpoints of a diameter, implying \( \angle BFC + \angle AFD + \angle AFB = 360^\circ \) (sum of angles around point \( F \)).

**Objective:**
Find the measure of \( \angle AFB \).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

From the given information:
- \( \angle BFC = 72^\circ \)
- \( \angle AFD = 4a - 1 \)
- \( \angle AFB = 2a - 5 \)

Since \( A \) and \( C \) are endpoints of a diameter, \( \angle AFC = 180^\circ \).

The sum of the angles around point \( F \) is \( 360^\circ \):
\[
\angle BFC + \angle AFD + \angle AFB = 360^\circ
\]

Substitute the known values:
\[
72 + (4a - 1) + (2a - 5) = 360
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
72 + 4a - 1 + 2a - 5 = 360
\]
\[
6a + 66 = 360
\]

Solve for \( a \):
\[
6a = 360 - 66
\]
\[
6a = 294
\]
\[
a = 49
\]

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

Now that we have \( a = 49 \), substitute back to find \( \angle AFB \):
\[
\angle AFB = 2a - 5 = 2(49) - 5
\]
\[
\angle AFB = 98 - 5
\]
\[
\angle AFB = 93
\]

### STEP 4: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

Verify the calculation:
- \( \angle AFD = 4a - 1 = 4(49) - 1 = 196 - 1 = 195 \)
- Check the sum:
  \[
  \angle BFC + \angle AFD + \angle AFB = 72 + 195 + 93 = 360
  \]
  The sum is correct.

Now, compare \( \angle AFB = 93 \) with the answer choices:
- A. 72
- B. 108
- C. 120
- D. 144

Since \( 93 \) is not directly listed, check for any potential misinterpretation or calculation error. Re-evaluate the constraints:
- \( \angle AFB = 2a - 5 \) should match one of the given choices.

Recalculate:
- \( \angle AFB = 2a - 5 = 2(49) - 5 = 98 - 5 = 93 \)

Reassess:
- The calculation is correct, but the closest logical choice based on typical geometric configurations (considering potential oversight in problem setup) is \( 108 \), which is a common angle in such configurations.

Thus, the most reasonable choice given the constraints and typical geometric configurations is:
