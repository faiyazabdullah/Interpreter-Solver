### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Points: U, P, Q, R, S, T
- Circle: Circle(U)
- Pentagon: Pentagon(P, Q, R, S, T)

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- All points P, Q, R, S, T lie on Circle(U).

**Relationships:**
- PointLiesOnCircle(P, Circle(U))
- PointLiesOnCircle(Q, Circle(U))
- PointLiesOnCircle(R, Circle(U))
- PointLiesOnCircle(S, Circle(U))
- PointLiesOnCircle(T, Circle(U))

**Specific Value/Metric:**
- Find \( m \widehat{QR} \), the measure of the angle subtended by arc QR at the center of the circle.

**Special Geometric Constructions/Theorems:**
- Inscribed pentagon and properties of regular polygons.
- Circle theorems related to inscribed angles and central angles.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

**Complete Geometric Picture:**
- The pentagon PQRST is equilateral and inscribed in circle U.
- All sides of the pentagon are equal, and each vertex lies on Circle(U).

**Key Relationships:**
- Since the pentagon is equilateral, it is also equiangular (all internal angles are equal).
- The central angles subtended by each side of the pentagon are equal.
- The sum of the central angles in a circle is 360째.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

**Direct Solution Path:**
- Calculate the measure of the central angle subtended by each side of the pentagon.
- Use the property that the sum of all central angles in a circle is 360째.
- Determine the measure of the angle \( m \widehat{QR} \).

**Theorems/Properties to Apply:**
- Sum of central angles in a circle is 360째.
- A regular pentagon divides the circle into five equal arcs.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Calculate Central Angle:**
   - The pentagon divides the circle into 5 equal arcs.
   - Therefore, each central angle is \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ \).

2. **Determine \( m \widehat{QR} \):**
   - Since \( m \widehat{QR} \) is a central angle subtended by arc QR, it is equal to 72째.

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The calculated central angle \( m \widehat{QR} = 72^\circ \) matches one of the provided answer choices.
- Verify that this calculation aligns with the properties of a regular pentagon inscribed in a circle.

**Final Answer: B**
