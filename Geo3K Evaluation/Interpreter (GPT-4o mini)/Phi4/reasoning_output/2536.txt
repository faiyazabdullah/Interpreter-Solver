To solve the given geometric problem, we'll follow the structured approach outlined.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Circles: \(\odot A\), \(\odot B\), \(\odot C\)

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- Diameters: \(\odot A\) = 10 units, \(\odot B\) = 30 units, \(\odot C\) = 10 units
- Radii: \(\odot A\) and \(\odot C\) have radii of 5 units, \(\odot B\) has a radius of 15 units
- \(A Z \cong C W\) and \(C W = 2\)

**Relationships:**
- Congruence: \(A Z \cong C W\)

**Positioning:**
- Points \(Z\) and \(W\) are related to circles \(\odot A\) and \(\odot C\)

**Question:**
- Find \(Z X\)

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- Since \(A Z \cong C W\) and \(C W = 2\), it follows that \(A Z = 2\).
- We need to find \(Z X\), which involves understanding the positioning of \(Z\) and \(X\).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- Use the congruence \(A Z \cong C W\) to establish that \(A Z = 2\).
- Consider the geometric configuration involving the circles and the points \(Z\) and \(W\).
- Use properties of circles and congruent segments to find \(Z X\).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Understanding the Configuration:**
   - \(A Z = 2\) implies \(Z\) is on the circle \(\odot A\) at a distance of 2 units from center \(A\).
   - Similarly, \(C W = 2\) implies \(W\) is on the circle \(\odot C\) at a distance of 2 units from center \(C\).

2. **Finding \(Z X\):**
   - Since \(A Z = 2\) and \(C W = 2\), and given the symmetry and congruence, \(Z\) and \(W\) are likely positioned symmetrically with respect to their respective circles.
   - Consider the line segment \(ZW\) as a chord or a line connecting these points.
   - If \(Z\) and \(W\) are directly aligned with a line through the centers \(A\) and \(C\), then \(Z X\) can be considered as part of a line segment connecting these points.

3. **Using Circle Properties:**
   - The distance between the centers \(A\) and \(C\) is the sum of their radii minus the distances \(A Z\) and \(C W\).
   - Distance \(AC = 10\) (since both circles have radii of 5 and are congruent).
   - \(Z X\) is the remaining segment on the line through \(A\), \(Z\), \(X\), and \(C\).

4. **Calculate \(Z X\):**
   - \(Z X = AC - (A Z + C W) = 10 - (2 + 2) = 6\).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- Verify: The calculation \(Z X = 6\) is consistent with the geometric configuration and given conditions.
- Compare with answer choices: The calculated \(Z X = 6\) matches choice D.
