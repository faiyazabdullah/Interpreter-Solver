PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the shaded sector of the circle. Let's proceed through the structured approach:

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

- **Geometric Shapes:**
  - Circle(X): Circle centered at point X.
  - Triangle(X, W, Y): Triangle with vertices at X, W, and Y.
  - Points: X, W, Y are points.
  - Lines: Lines W-X, X-Y, and W-Y.
  - Angle(W, X, Y): Angle formed at point X by lines W-X and X-Y.

- **Measurements and Equalities:**
  - MeasureOf(Angle(W, X, Y)) = 52 degrees.
  - LengthOf(Line(W, X)) = 2 units.

- **Relationships:**
  - X is the center of the circle, making W and Y points on the circle.
  - Line(W, X) is a radius of the circle.

- **Specific Value to Find:**
  - The area of the shaded sector formed by angle WXY.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- **Key Relationships:**
  - Since X is the center of the circle and W is on the circle, Line(W, X) is a radius of the circle.
  - Length of radius (Line(W, X)) = 2 units.
  - Angle WXY is an inscribed angle that subtends the arc WY.

- **Circle Properties:**
  - The central angle corresponding to the inscribed angle WXY is twice the inscribed angle.
  - Central angle = 2 * 52 = 104 degrees.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- **Formula for Sector Area:**
  - The area of a sector of a circle is given by:
    \[
    \text{Area of Sector} = \frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi r^2
    \]
  where \(\theta\) is the central angle in degrees, and \(r\) is the radius.

- **Substitute Known Values:**
  - \(\theta = 104\) degrees
  - \(r = 2\) units

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

- **Calculate the Area:**
  \[
  \text{Area of Sector} = \frac{104}{360} \times \pi \times (2)^2
  \]
  \[
  = \frac{104}{360} \times \pi \times 4
  \]
  \[
  = \frac{104}{90} \times \pi
  \]
  \[
  = \frac{52}{45} \times \pi
  \]

- **Approximate Calculation:**
  - Using \(\pi \approx 3.1416\),
  \[
  \text{Area} \approx \frac{52}{45} \times 3.1416
  \]
  \[
  \approx 1.1556 \times 3.1416
  \]
  \[
  \approx 3.631
  \]

- **Round to the Nearest Tenth:**
  - The area of the sector is approximately 3.6.

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- **Compare with Answer Choices:**
  - A. 0.9
  - B. 1.8
  - C. 10.8
  - D. 12.6

- **Closest Match:**
  - The calculated area (3.6) is not exactly listed, but it is closest to option B (1.8) when considering the rounding and possible simplification errors.

Final Answer: B
