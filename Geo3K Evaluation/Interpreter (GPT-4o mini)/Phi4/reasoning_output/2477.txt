PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to determine the measure of angle \( \angle B \) in triangle \( \triangle ABC \) where \( \angle BAC = 122^\circ \). Let's go through the problem step-by-step.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- We have a circle with points \( A, B, \) and \( C \) on its circumference, forming triangle \( \triangle ABC \).

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- \( \text{MeasureOf}(\angle BAC) = 122^\circ \).

**Positioning:**
- Points \( A, B, \) and \( C \) lie on the circle, which implies that \( \triangle ABC \) is an inscribed triangle.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

Since \( \triangle ABC \) is inscribed in a circle, we can use the property of inscribed angles:
- The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.

Given:
- \( \angle BAC = 122^\circ \).

The arc \( BC \) is intercepted by \( \angle BAC \). Therefore, the measure of arc \( BC \) is \( 2 \times 122^\circ = 244^\circ \).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

We need to find \( m \angle B \). Using the property of inscribed angles:
- \( \angle B \) intercepts arc \( AC \).

Since the total measure of the circle is \( 360^\circ \), the measure of arc \( AC \) is:
\[ \text{Arc } AC = 360^\circ - \text{Arc } BC = 360^\circ - 244^\circ = 116^\circ. \]

The measure of \( \angle B \) is half the measure of arc \( AC \):
\[ m \angle B = \frac{116^\circ}{2} = 58^\circ. \]

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

We have calculated:
- \( m \angle B = 58^\circ \).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

Verify:
- The calculations are consistent with the properties of inscribed angles and arcs.

Compare with answer choices:
- A. 29
- B. 58
- C. 61
- D. 122

The calculated measure \( m \angle B = 58^\circ \) matches choice B.

Final Answer: B
