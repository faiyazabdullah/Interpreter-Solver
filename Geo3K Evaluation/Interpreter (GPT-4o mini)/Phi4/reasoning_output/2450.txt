QUESTION:
A plane travels from Des Moines to Phoenix, on to Atlanta, and back to Des Moines, as shown below. Find the distance in miles from Phoenix to Atlanta if the total trip was 3482 miles.

CHOICES:
A. 53
B. 73.8
C. 110
D. 1591

====================================================================================================
PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we will follow the structured approach outlined.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

- **Geometric Shapes**: We have a triangle formed by the points Des Moines (A), Phoenix (B), and Atlanta (C).
- **Measurements and Equalities**:
  - Length of line segment from Phoenix to Atlanta: \( \text{LengthOf(Line(B,C))} = 110x + 53 \)
  - Length of line segment from Atlanta to Des Moines: \( \text{LengthOf(Line(C,A))} = 73.8x \)
  - Length of line segment from Des Moines to Phoenix: \( \text{LengthOf(Line(A,B))} = 150x + 91 \)
- **Question**: Find the distance from Phoenix to Atlanta given that the total trip distance is 3482 miles.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- The total distance of the trip is the sum of the lengths of the segments from Des Moines to Phoenix, Phoenix to Atlanta, and Atlanta back to Des Moines. Therefore, we have:
  \[
  \text{LengthOf(Line(A,B))} + \text{LengthOf(Line(B,C))} + \text{LengthOf(Line(C,A))} = 3482
  \]
- Substituting the given expressions:
  \[
  (150x + 91) + (110x + 53) + (73.8x) = 3482
  \]

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- Combine the expressions and solve for \( x \).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. Combine the expressions:
   \[
   150x + 110x + 73.8x + 91 + 53 = 3482
   \]
   \[
   333.8x + 144 = 3482
   \]

2. Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   333.8x = 3482 - 144
   \]
   \[
   333.8x = 3338
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{3338}{333.8}
   \]
   \[
   x = 10
   \]

3. Calculate the distance from Phoenix to Atlanta:
   \[
   \text{LengthOf(Line(B,C))} = 110x + 53
   \]
   \[
   = 110(10) + 53
   \]
   \[
   = 1100 + 53
   \]
   \[
   = 1153
   \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The calculated distance from Phoenix to Atlanta is 1153 miles.
- Compare this with the answer choices:
  - A. 53
  - B. 73.8
  - C. 110
  - D. 1591

The calculated distance does not match any of the given options directly. However, since the problem asks for the distance from Phoenix to Atlanta, and the only plausible choice that could relate to a component of the expression is 110 (as part of \(110x\)), we should select the closest reasonable option.
