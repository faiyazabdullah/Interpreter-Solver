### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Points: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I
- Lines: A-D, A-F, B-H, B-E, A-G, C-I
- Angles: D-A-B, C-B-A

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- Measure of \(\angle DAB\) = 38 degrees
- Measure of \(\angle CBA\) = 33 degrees

**Relationships:**
- Lines A-D and B-H are parallel.
- Points lie on specific lines as given.

**Question:**
- Find the measure of \(\angle ABC\).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

**Key Observations:**
- \(\angle DAB\) and \(\angle CBA\) are given.
- Lines A-D and B-H are parallel, which suggests the use of the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem or Corresponding Angles Theorem.

**Geometric Configuration:**
- Since lines A-D and B-H are parallel, and line B-E intersects them, \(\angle DAB\) and \(\angle ABC\) are alternate interior angles.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

**Theorem Application:**
- Use the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem: If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then each pair of alternate interior angles is equal.

**Solution Path:**
- Since \(\angle DAB\) is an alternate interior angle to \(\angle ABC\) with respect to the parallel lines A-D and B-H, they must be equal.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

**Calculation:**
- Measure of \(\angle DAB\) = 38 degrees
- By the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem, \(\angle ABC = \angle DAB = 38\) degrees.

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

**Verification:**
- The calculation aligns with the geometric properties of parallel lines and transversals.
- The measure of \(\angle ABC\) is indeed 38 degrees.

**Answer Selection:**
- Compare the calculated measure with the answer choices:
  - A. 33
  - B. 38
  - C. 61
  - D. 71

The correct answer is choice B.
