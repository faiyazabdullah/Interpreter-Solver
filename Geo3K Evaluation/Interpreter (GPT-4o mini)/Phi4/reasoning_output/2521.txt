PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's solve the problem step by step according to the outlined structured approach.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shape:** 
- We are given a triangle \( \triangle RST \).

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- \( \text{Length of } RS = x + 9 \)
- \( \text{Length of } ST = 2x \)
- \( \text{Length of } RT = 3x - 9 \)

**Relationships:**
- We need to find \( x \) such that \( \triangle RST \) is equilateral. In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal.

**Specific Value Needed:**
- We are asked to find \( x \) such that all sides are equal.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

**Key Relationships:**
- For \( \triangle RST \) to be equilateral:
  \[
  RS = ST = RT
  \]

This gives us the following equations:
1. \( x + 9 = 2x \)
2. \( 2x = 3x - 9 \)
3. \( 3x - 9 = x + 9 \)

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

We'll solve each equation to find \( x \).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

**Solving Equation 1:**
\[
x + 9 = 2x
\]
Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
\[
9 = x
\]

**Solving Equation 2:**
\[
2x = 3x - 9
\]
Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:
\[
0 = x - 9
\]
Add 9 to both sides:
\[
x = 9
\]

**Solving Equation 3:**
\[
3x - 9 = x + 9
\]
Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
\[
2x - 9 = 9
\]
Add 9 to both sides:
\[
2x = 18
\]
Divide by 2:
\[
x = 9
\]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

All three equations give \( x = 9 \). Therefore, the value of \( x \) that makes \( \triangle RST \) equilateral is 9.

**Answer Choices:**
- A. 3
- B. 6
- C. 9
- D. 12

The correct answer is \( x = 9 \).
