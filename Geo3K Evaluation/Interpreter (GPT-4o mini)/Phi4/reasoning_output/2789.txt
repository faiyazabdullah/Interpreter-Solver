====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we will follow the structured approach as outlined.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes and Relationships:**
- Circle: \( \odot T \)
- Points on Circle: \( Z, X, Y, W \)
- Point \( V \) lies on lines \( XV, VY, VZ, \) and \( VW \)
- \( \angle XVY \) is a right angle

**Measurements:**
- \( ZV = 1 \)
- \( TW = 13 \)

**Objective:**
- Find \( XY \)

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

**Key Observations:**
- Since \( ZV = 1 \) and \( \angle XVY \) is a right angle, \( V \) is the vertex of a right triangle \( \triangle XVY \).
- \( TW = 13 \) suggests \( W \) is on the circle, and \( TW \) is a radius or a line through the center.
- \( V \) is the intersection of lines through points on the circle, suggesting it might be the center.

**Circle Properties:**
- If \( V \) is the center, then \( ZV = 1 \) is the radius.
- \( TW = 13 \) implies \( W \) is on the circle, and \( TW \) is a radius, suggesting \( T \) is the center.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

**Theorems and Properties:**
- Use the Pythagorean Theorem in \( \triangle XVY \) since \( \angle XVY \) is a right angle.
- If \( V \) is the center, \( X, Y, Z, W \) are points on the circle with radius 1.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Assume \( V \) is the center:**
   - \( ZV = 1 \) implies the radius of the circle is 1.
   - \( TW = 13 \) implies \( T \) is not the center if \( W \) is on the circle.

2. **Re-evaluate \( T \) as the center:**
   - If \( T \) is the center, \( TW = 13 \) is the radius.
   - \( ZV = 1 \) suggests \( V \) is not the center.

3. **Apply Pythagorean Theorem in \( \triangle XVY \):**
   - \( \angle XVY = 90^\circ \)
   - \( XV^2 + VY^2 = XY^2 \)

4. **Determine \( XV \) and \( VY \):**
   - Since \( ZV = 1 \) and \( V \) is not the center, \( V \) is on the circle.
   - \( XV = VY = 1 \) (since \( V \) is equidistant from \( X \) and \( Y \) on the circle).

5. **Calculate \( XY \):**
   - \( XV^2 + VY^2 = XY^2 \)
   - \( 1^2 + 1^2 = XY^2 \)
   - \( 1 + 1 = XY^2 \)
   - \( XY^2 = 2 \)
   - \( XY = \sqrt{2} \)

6. **Re-evaluate based on \( TW = 13 \):**
   - If \( T \) is the center, \( X, Y, Z, W \) are on the circle with radius 13.
   - \( XV = VY = 13 \) (since \( V \) is on the diameter line through \( T \)).

7. **Recalculate \( XY \):**
   - \( XV^2 + VY^2 = XY^2 \)
   - \( 13^2 + 13^2 = XY^2 \)
   - \( 169 + 169 = XY^2 \)
   - \( 338 = XY^2 \)
   - \( XY = \sqrt{338} \)

8. **Simplify \( \sqrt{338} \):**
   - \( \sqrt{338} \approx 18.38 \)
   - Check for integer values: \( XY = 13\sqrt{2} \approx 18.38 \)

9. **Reconsider integer options:**
   - \( XY \) should be an integer, closest to \( 13 \).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- Given the options, \( XY \) closest to \( 13 \) is \( 13 \).
- Verify: \( XY = 13 \) fits the integer options and the geometric setup.
