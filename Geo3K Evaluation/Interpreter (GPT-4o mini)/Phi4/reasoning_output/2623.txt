To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of \( AB \) in the trapezoid \( ABCD \) given certain conditions about the midpoints and parallel lines.

### Step 1: Predicate Analysis and Setup

- **Geometric Shapes**: We have a trapezoid \( ABCD \) with \( AB \parallel CD \).
- **Measurements and Equalities**: 
  - \( AB = x + 4 \)
  - \( CD = 3x + 2 \)
  - \( ST = 9 \), where \( S \) and \( T \) are midpoints of \( AD \) and \( BC \), respectively.
- **Relationships**: 
  - \( S \) and \( T \) are midpoints, so \( ST \) is the midsegment of the trapezoid.
  - The midsegment \( ST \) of a trapezoid is parallel to the bases and its length is the average of the lengths of the bases.

### Step 2: Constraint Synthesis

- **Key Relationship**: The length of the midsegment \( ST \) is given by:
  \[
  ST = \frac{AB + CD}{2}
  \]
- We know \( ST = 9 \), \( AB = x + 4 \), and \( CD = 3x + 2 \).

### Step 3: Solution Strategy

- Use the formula for the midsegment to set up an equation:
  \[
  9 = \frac{(x + 4) + (3x + 2)}{2}
  \]
- Solve this equation for \( x \).

### Step 4: Mathematical Derivation

1. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   9 = \frac{x + 4 + 3x + 2}{2}
   \]
   \[
   9 = \frac{4x + 6}{2}
   \]

2. Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   18 = 4x + 6
   \]

3. Subtract 6 from both sides:
   \[
   12 = 4x
   \]

4. Divide by 4 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 3
   \]

5. Substitute \( x = 3 \) back into the expression for \( AB \):
   \[
   AB = x + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7
   \]

### Step 5: Verification and Answer Selection

- Verify the calculation:
  - With \( x = 3 \), \( AB = 7 \) and \( CD = 3(3) + 2 = 11 \).
  - Check the midsegment: 
    \[
    ST = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9
    \]
  - This matches the given \( ST = 9 \).

- Compare with answer choices: The calculated \( AB = 7 \) matches choice C.
