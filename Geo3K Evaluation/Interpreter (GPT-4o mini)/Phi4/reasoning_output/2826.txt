PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to determine the measure of \(\angle 3\) given that \(m \angle 1 = 30^\circ\) in the rectangle \(WXYZ\).

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

1. **Geometric Shapes:**
   - Rectangle \(WXYZ\) implies opposite sides are equal and all angles are \(90^\circ\).

2. **Measurements and Equalities:**
   - \(\angle 1 = 30^\circ\) is given.
   - All angles in the rectangle are \(90^\circ\).

3. **Relationships:**
   - Diagonals \(WZ\) and \(XY\) intersect at point \(A\).
   - Diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other and are equal in length.

4. **Positioning:**
   - Intersection of diagonals at \(A\) implies \(A\) is the midpoint of both diagonals.

5. **Special Constructions:**
   - Diagonals bisect each other and create four right triangles within the rectangle.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- Since \(WXYZ\) is a rectangle, diagonals \(WZ\) and \(XY\) are equal and bisect each other at \(A\).
- \(\angle WAZ\), \(\angle XAY\), \(\angle YAW\), and \(\angle ZAX\) are all \(90^\circ\) because diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other at right angles.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- We need to find \(\angle 3\). Let's assume \(\angle 1\) is one of the angles formed by the intersection of the diagonals and a side of the rectangle.
- Since \(\angle 1 = 30^\circ\), it is likely part of a right triangle formed by the diagonal and a side of the rectangle.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Identify \(\angle 1\):**
   - Assume \(\angle 1\) is \(\angle WAX\) or \(\angle XAW\).
   - Since \(\angle WAX + \angle XAW = 90^\circ\) (because they are complementary angles in the right triangle \(\triangle WAX\)), and \(\angle 1 = 30^\circ\), then \(\angle XAW = 60^\circ\).

2. **Determine \(\angle 3\):**
   - \(\angle 3\) is likely \(\angle YAZ\) or \(\angle ZAY\).
   - By symmetry and properties of the rectangle, \(\angle YAZ = \angle XAW = 60^\circ\).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- Verify: The diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other and form congruent right triangles. Given \(\angle 1 = 30^\circ\), the complementary angle in the right triangle is \(60^\circ\).
- Compare with answer choices: \(60^\circ\) is option C.
