Let's solve the problem step by step according to the given instructions.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Rectangle \(ABCD\)
- Lines: \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), \(DA\), \(AC\), \(BD\), \(AE\), \(CE\), \(BE\), \(DE\)
- Point \(E\)

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- Lengths: \(AB = 2\), \(BC = 7\), \(CD = 3\), \(BD = 4\), \(AE = 1\), \(CE = 8\)
- \(E\) is the midpoint of \(AC\) and \(BD\)

**Relationships:**
- \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, so \(AB \parallel CD\) and \(AD \parallel BC\)
- \(AC\) and \(BD\) are diagonals of the rectangle and intersect at \(E\)

**Positioning:**
- \(E\) is the midpoint of both diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\)

**Question:**
- Find \(m \angle 3\) given \(m \angle 2 = 40^\circ\).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

1. **Rectangle Properties:**
   - Opposite sides are equal: \(AB = CD = 2\) and \(AD = BC = 7\).
   - Diagonals are equal: \(AC = BD\).

2. **Diagonal Lengths:**
   - Since \(E\) is the midpoint of \(AC\) and \(BD\), \(AE = EC\) and \(BE = ED\).
   - Given \(AE = 1\) and \(CE = 8\), \(AC = AE + EC = 1 + 8 = 9\).
   - Given \(BD = 4\), \(BE = ED = 2\).

3. **Diagonal Intersection:**
   - Diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other.
   - \(E\) is the midpoint of both diagonals.

4. **Angle Relationships:**
   - In a rectangle, diagonals bisect each other and are equal.
   - \(\angle AEB\) and \(\angle CED\) are vertically opposite angles.
   - \(\angle AEB = \angle CED\).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- Since \(m \angle 2 = 40^\circ\), and \(\angle AEB\) and \(\angle CED\) are vertically opposite angles, \(m \angle AEB = 40^\circ\).
- In \(\triangle AEB\), since \(E\) is the midpoint of \(AC\) and \(BD\), \(\angle AEB\) and \(\angle ABE\) are angles formed by the diagonals.
- The diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other and form two congruent triangles.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

- In \(\triangle AEB\), since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, \(\angle ABE\) and \(\angle AEB\) are supplementary to \(\angle ABD\).
- \(\angle ABD\) is a right angle because \(ABCD\) is a rectangle.
- Therefore, \(\angle ABE + \angle AEB = 90^\circ\).
- Given \(m \angle AEB = 40^\circ\), we have:
  \[
  m \angle ABE = 90^\circ - 40^\circ = 50^\circ
  \]
- Since \(\angle ABE\) corresponds to \(\angle 3\) in the problem, \(m \angle 3 = 50^\circ\).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- Verify: The calculations align with the properties of a rectangle and the given angles.
- Compare with answer choices: \(m \angle 3 = 50^\circ\) matches choice C.

Final Answer: C
