To solve this problem, we will follow the structured approach provided:

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Points: E, F, G, H, K
- Lines: EF, FG, GH, HE, EG, FH
- Rectangle: EFGH

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- F K = 32 feet

**Relationships:**
- IntersectAt(Line(E,G), Line(F,H), Line(H,E), Point(K)) indicates that diagonals EG and FH intersect at point K.
- RightAngle(Angle(H,E,F)) confirms that rectangle EFGH has right angles at each vertex.

**Specific Value to Find:**
- We need to find the length of diagonal EG.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

**Key Relationships:**
- In rectangle EFGH, diagonals EG and FH are equal and bisect each other at point K.
- Since diagonals bisect each other, EK = KG and FK = KH.
- Right angles at each vertex confirm the properties of a rectangle.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

**Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
- In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal.
- Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of a diagonal if we know the side lengths.

**Plan:**
1. Use the property of bisected diagonals in a rectangle to express EG in terms of FK.
2. Apply the Pythagorean theorem to find EG using the relationship between the sides and diagonals.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Diagonals Bisect Each Other:**
   - Since K is the midpoint of both diagonals, FK = KH = 32 feet.

2. **Diagonal Lengths:**
   - In a rectangle, diagonals are equal: EG = FH.
   - Since diagonals bisect each other, EK = KG and FK = KH.
   - Therefore, EG = 2 * EK = 2 * FK = 2 * 32 = 64 feet.

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The calculated length of diagonal EG is 64 feet.
- Compare this with the answer choices:
  - A. 13
  - B. 30
  - C. 57
  - D. 64

The correct answer is choice D.
