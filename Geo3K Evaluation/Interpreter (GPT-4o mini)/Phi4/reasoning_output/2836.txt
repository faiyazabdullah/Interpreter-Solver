To solve the problem, we will go through each step systematically.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Points: B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, L
- Lines: BF, GH
- Circles: G, J, K
- Intersections: L is a common intersection point of circles G, J, and K.

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- GH = 10

**Positioning:**
- B, F, H lie on circle G.
- C, D, L lie on circle J.
- L is a common point on circles G, J, and K.

**Objective:**
- Find the measure of J L, given that circles G, J, and K intersect at L and GH = 10.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

**Key Relationships:**
- Since L is a common point on circles G, J, and K, it implies that L is on the radical axis of any two of these circles.
- GH = 10 implies that G and H are endpoints of a chord in circle G.
- The power of point L with respect to circle G and circle J is equal, as L lies on both circles.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

**Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
- The power of a point theorem states that for a point L on the radical axis of two circles, the power of L with respect to both circles is equal.
- For circle G, the power of L is \( LG^2 - r_G^2 \).
- For circle J, the power of L is \( LJ^2 - r_J^2 \).

**Plan:**
1. Use the power of a point theorem to equate the powers of L with respect to circles G and J.
2. Use the given GH = 10 to find relationships involving the radius of circle G.
3. Solve for LJ using the equality of powers.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Power of Point L with respect to Circle G:**
   - Since L is on circle G, the power of L is zero: \( LG^2 - r_G^2 = 0 \).
   - Therefore, \( LG = r_G \).

2. **Power of Point L with respect to Circle J:**
   - Similarly, since L is on circle J, the power of L is zero: \( LJ^2 - r_J^2 = 0 \).
   - Therefore, \( LJ = r_J \).

3. **Using GH = 10:**
   - GH is a chord of circle G. The midpoint of GH is equidistant from G, and the perpendicular from G to GH bisects GH.
   - Let M be the midpoint of GH. Then GM is perpendicular to GH, and GM = \(\sqrt{r_G^2 - (GH/2)^2}\).
   - \( GM = \sqrt{r_G^2 - 5^2} = \sqrt{r_G^2 - 25} \).

4. **Equating Powers:**
   - Since L is on the radical axis, \( LG^2 - r_G^2 = LJ^2 - r_J^2 \).
   - Given \( LG = r_G \) and \( LJ = r_J \), the powers are equal, confirming \( LJ = r_J \).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since L is equidistant from G and J, and GH = 10, the symmetry and equal power imply \( LJ = 5 \).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The measure \( JL = 5 \) is consistent with the symmetry and power of point theorem.
- The answer choice that matches this calculation is:
