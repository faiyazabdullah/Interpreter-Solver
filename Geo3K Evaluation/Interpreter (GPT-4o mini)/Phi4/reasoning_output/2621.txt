====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we'll apply the properties of an isosceles triangle and the given predicates to find the value of \( x \), which will help us determine the length \( ST \).

### Step 1: Predicate Analysis and Setup

We are given the following geometric predicates:

- \( \text{Triangle}(S, T, R) \)
- \( \text{IsSideOf(Line}(S, T), \text{Triangle}(S, T, R)) \)
- \( \text{IsSideOf(Line}(S, R), \text{Triangle}(S, T, R)) \)
- \( \text{IsSideOf(Line}(T, R), \text{Triangle}(S, T, R)) \)
- \( \text{Equals(LengthOf(Line}(S, T)), 12 + x) \)
- \( \text{Equals(LengthOf(Line}(S, R)), 4x - 4) \)
- \( \text{Equals(LengthOf(Line}(T, R)), 3x + 3) \)
- \( \text{Isosceles(Triangle}(S, T, R)) \)

From the isosceles property, two sides of the triangle must be equal. We need to find which two sides are equal by setting their lengths equal to each other.

### Step 2: Constraint Synthesis

The possible equalities from the isosceles property are:

1. \( 12 + x = 4x - 4 \)
2. \( 12 + x = 3x + 3 \)
3. \( 4x - 4 = 3x + 3 \)

We will solve each equation to find possible values of \( x \).

### Step 3: Solution Strategy

#### Case 1: \( 12 + x = 4x - 4 \)

\[
12 + x = 4x - 4
\]

Subtract \( x \) from both sides:

\[
12 = 3x - 4
\]

Add 4 to both sides:

\[
16 = 3x
\]

Divide by 3:

\[
x = \frac{16}{3}
\]

This value does not lead to integer side lengths, so it is not suitable.

#### Case 2: \( 12 + x = 3x + 3 \)

\[
12 + x = 3x + 3
\]

Subtract \( x \) from both sides:

\[
12 = 2x + 3
\]

Subtract 3 from both sides:

\[
9 = 2x
\]

Divide by 2:

\[
x = \frac{9}{2}
\]

This value also does not lead to integer side lengths, so it is not suitable.

#### Case 3: \( 4x - 4 = 3x + 3 \)

\[
4x - 4 = 3x + 3
\]

Subtract \( 3x \) from both sides:

\[
x - 4 = 3
\]

Add 4 to both sides:

\[
x = 7
\]

This value is an integer and will be checked for consistency.

### Step 4: Mathematical Derivation

Substitute \( x = 7 \) into the expressions for the side lengths:

- \( \text{Length of } ST = 12 + x = 12 + 7 = 19 \)
- \( \text{Length of } SR = 4x - 4 = 4(7) - 4 = 28 - 4 = 24 \)
- \( \text{Length of } TR = 3x + 3 = 3(7) + 3 = 21 + 3 = 24 \)

The sides \( SR \) and \( TR \) are equal, confirming the triangle is isosceles.

### Step 5: Verification and Answer Selection

The side \( ST \) is calculated as 19, which matches one of the answer choices.
