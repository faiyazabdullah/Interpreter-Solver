To solve the problem, we will follow the structured step-by-step approach outlined.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Two triangles are given: Triangle(S, P, T) and Triangle(U, Q, W).

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- Isosceles triangles: Triangle(S, R, P) and Triangle(Q, U, V).
- Angle measures: MeasureOf(Angle(S, R, P)) = x and equals MeasureOf(Angle(Q, U, V)).
- Lengths: LengthOf(Line(P, T)) = 13.5, LengthOf(Line(Q, U)) = 3.
- Angle: MeasureOf(Angle(V, Q, W)) = 9.

**Relationships:**
- MeasureOf(Angle(S, R, P)) = MeasureOf(Angle(Q, U, V)).

**Goal:**
- Find the value of x.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

**Key Relationships:**
- Since Triangle(S, R, P) is isosceles with MeasureOf(Angle(S, R, P)) = x, the angles at S and P are equal.
- Similarly, Triangle(Q, U, V) is isosceles with MeasureOf(Angle(Q, U, V)) = x, so the angles at Q and V are equal.
- We know MeasureOf(Angle(V, Q, W)) = 9.

**Triangle Angle Sum:**
- In Triangle(Q, U, V), the sum of angles is 180 degrees:
  \[
  \text{MeasureOf(Angle(Q, U, V))} + \text{MeasureOf(Angle(V, Q, U))} + \text{MeasureOf(Angle(U, V, Q))} = 180
  \]
  \[
  x + \text{MeasureOf(Angle(V, Q, U))} + 9 = 180
  \]
  \[
  \text{MeasureOf(Angle(V, Q, U))} = 180 - x - 9 = 171 - x
  \]

Since Triangle(Q, U, V) is isosceles with Q and V as the base angles, MeasureOf(Angle(Q, U, V)) = MeasureOf(Angle(U, V, Q)) = x.

Thus, the equation becomes:
\[
x + x + 9 = 180
\]
\[
2x + 9 = 180
\]
\[
2x = 171
\]
\[
x = 85.5
\]

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

The calculation above shows that x = 85.5, but this doesn't match any of the given answer choices. Let's re-evaluate the setup:

- Since MeasureOf(Angle(V, Q, W)) = 9, and Triangle(Q, U, V) is isosceles, the remaining two angles must be equal and sum to \(171\).

Re-evaluate:
\[
2x + 9 = 180
\]
\[
2x = 171
\]
\[
x = 85.5
\]

This confirms the calculation is consistent with the setup, but the choices provided do not include 85.5. Let's check for any misinterpretation:

- The problem might be asking for a specific angle related to the given conditions, but the setup and constraints lead to x = 85.5.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

Re-evaluate the angle relations:
- Given MeasureOf(Angle(V, Q, W)) = 9, and knowing the isosceles property, the calculation should yield a feasible angle.

Re-calculate:
\[
x + x + 9 = 180
\]
\[
2x = 171
\]
\[
x = 85.5
\]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

Given the constraints and the setup, the calculation consistently yields x = 85.5, which is not among the choices. However, the closest reasonable option based on typical angle measures in such problems is:

- MeasureOf(Angle(V, Q, W)) = 9, suggesting a smaller angle might be expected in the context of the problem.

Thus, the closest reasonable choice based on typical geometric problems and the given options is:
