Let's solve the problem step-by-step using the given geometric predicates and reasoning.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes and Elements:**
- Circle(E): There is a circle E.
- Quadrilateral(F, C, A, G): A quadrilateral with vertices F, C, A, G.
- Points: Points F, C, A, G lie on circle E.

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- LengthOf(Line(F, C)) = 8
- LengthOf(Line(C, A)) = 6

**Positioning and Relationships:**
- All points F, C, A, G lie on circle E, meaning quadrilateral F-C-A-G is cyclic.
- Since the quadrilateral is inscribed in the circle and all its vertices lie on the circle, it is a cyclic quadrilateral.

**Objective:**
- Find the exact circumference of circle E.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

**Understanding the Quadrilateral:**
- The quadrilateral F-C-A-G is inscribed in circle E and given the lengths of sides FC = 8 and CA = 6, we need to determine the nature of this quadrilateral.
- Since all vertices lie on the circle and the problem involves a rectangle inscribed in the circle, F-C-A-G must be a rectangle (as all rectangles are cyclic and can be inscribed in a circle).

**Rectangle Properties:**
- In a rectangle inscribed in a circle, the diagonals are equal and pass through the center of the circle. They are also diameters of the circle.
- The diagonals of the rectangle are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

**Diagonal Calculation:**
- To find the diameter of the circle, calculate the diagonal of the rectangle using the Pythagorean theorem.
- The sides of the rectangle are FC = 8 and CA = 6.
- The diagonal (d) can be calculated as follows:
  \[
  d = \sqrt{(FC)^2 + (CA)^2} = \sqrt{8^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{64 + 36} = \sqrt{100} = 10
  \]

**Circumference Calculation:**
- The diagonal of the rectangle is the diameter of the circle.
- Therefore, the diameter of circle E is 10.
- The circumference \( C \) of a circle is given by the formula:
  \[
  C = \pi \times \text{diameter} = \pi \times 10 = 10\pi
  \]

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

- We have calculated the diameter of the circle as 10.
- Using the formula for circumference, we find:
  \[
  C = 10\pi
  \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The calculated circumference \( 10\pi \) matches one of the provided answer choices.
- Therefore, the correct answer is:
