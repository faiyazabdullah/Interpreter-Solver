PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

- **Geometric Shapes:**
  - Circle \( B \)
  - Points \( D \), \( E \), and \( C \) lie on Circle \( B \).

- **Measurements and Equalities:**
  - \( \text{MeasureOf}(\angle CBE) = 3x \)
  - \( \text{MeasureOf}(\angle CDE) = 5x - 12 \)

- **Question:** Find the value of \( x \).

- **Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
  - The sum of the angles around a point is \( 360^\circ \).
  - Angles subtended by the same arc in a circle are equal.
  - The angles in a triangle sum to \( 180^\circ \).
  - Inscribed angle theorem: An angle subtended by an arc at the circumference is half the angle subtended at the center.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- Since \( C \), \( D \), and \( E \) all lie on circle \( B \), angles \( \angle CBE \) and \( \angle CDE \) are related through the circle's properties.

- **Key Relationships:**
  - \( \angle CBE \) and \( \angle CDE \) are subtended by the same arc \( CE \).
  - By the inscribed angle theorem, \( \angle CDE = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{central angle subtended by arc } CE \).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- Since \( \angle CBE \) and \( \angle CDE \) subtend the same arc \( CE \), they are related by the inscribed angle theorem:
  \[
  \angle CDE = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{central angle subtended by arc } CE = \angle CBE
  \]

- Set up the equation using the given measures:
  \[
  5x - 12 = 3x
  \]

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

- Solve the equation:
  \[
  5x - 12 = 3x
  \]

- Subtract \( 3x \) from both sides:
  \[
  2x - 12 = 0
  \]

- Add 12 to both sides:
  \[
  2x = 12
  \]

- Divide by 2:
  \[
  x = 6
  \]

- **Verification:**
  - Substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the angle measures:
    - \( \angle CBE = 3x = 18^\circ \)
    - \( \angle CDE = 5x - 12 = 30 - 12 = 18^\circ \)

- Both angles are equal, confirming the relationship through the inscribed angle theorem.

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The calculated value \( x = 6 \) does not match any of the provided answer choices directly. Re-evaluate the setup and constraints:

- Reconsider the relationship:
  - The angles \( \angle CBE \) and \( \angle CDE \) are not directly equal but related through the circle's properties.

- Correct setup:
  - \( \angle CDE = 180^\circ - \angle CBE \) (since they are supplementary angles on the circle's arc)

- Correct equation:
  \[
  5x - 12 = 180^\circ - 3x
  \]

- Solve the equation:
  \[
  5x - 12 = 180 - 3x
  \]

- Add \( 3x \) to both sides:
  \[
  8x - 12 = 180
  \]

- Add 12 to both sides:
  \[
  8x = 192
  \]

- Divide by 8:
  \[
  x = 24
  \]

- **Verification:**
  - Substitute \( x = 24 \) back into the angle measures:
    - \( \angle CBE = 3x = 72^\circ \)
    - \( \angle CDE = 5x - 12 = 120 - 12 = 108^\circ \)

- Check the supplementary relationship:
  - \( 72^\circ + 108^\circ = 180^\circ \)

- The calculated value \( x = 24 \) is not in the answer choices, indicating a need to re-evaluate the setup.

- Re-evaluate:
  - \( \angle CDE = 180^\circ - \angle CBE \) is correct, but check for calculation errors.

- Re-solve:
  \[
  5x - 12 = 180 - 3x
  \]

- Add \( 3x \) to both sides:
  \[
  8x - 12 = 180
  \]

- Add 12 to both sides:
  \[
  8x = 192
  \]
