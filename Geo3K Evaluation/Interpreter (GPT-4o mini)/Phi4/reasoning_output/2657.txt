====================================================================================================
Let's solve the problem step-by-step according to the provided instructions.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Triangle(A, B, C): Triangle with vertices A, B, and C.
- RightAngle(Angle(A, C, D)): There is a right angle at point C, indicating that line AC is perpendicular to line CD.

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- Equals(HeightOf(Triangle(A, B, C)), 7): The height of the triangle from vertex C to base AB is 7 units.
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(B, C)), 10.2): The length of line segment BC is 10.2 units.

**Identify the Value:**
- We need to find the area of triangle ABC.

**Geometric Theorems and Properties:**
- Right triangle properties, area formula for triangles.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- Since there is a right angle at C, triangle ABC is a right triangle with the right angle at C.
- The height from C to the base AB is given as 7.
- The side BC, which is opposite the right angle, is given as 10.2.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- Use the area formula for a triangle: 
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
  \]
- In a right triangle, one of the legs can be considered as the base, and the other as the height. Here, the height is given as 7, and BC, which is 10.2, can be considered as one of the legs.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

- Since triangle ABC is a right triangle with the right angle at C, we can consider BC as one leg and the height from C to AB as the other leg.
- The area of triangle ABC can be calculated using BC as the base and the height from C to AB:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10.2 \times 7
  \]
- Calculate the area:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10.2 \times 7 = 5.1 \times 7 = 35.7
  \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The calculated area is 35.7.
- Compare this with the answer choices:
  - A. 35.7
  - B. 49
  - C. 71.4
  - D. 104.0

The calculated area matches choice A.
