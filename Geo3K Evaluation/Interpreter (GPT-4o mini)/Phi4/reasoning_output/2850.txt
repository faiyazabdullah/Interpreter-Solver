Let's solve the problem step-by-step, following the structured approach outlined.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Rectangle \( EFGH \)

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- \( EF = 4x - 6 \)
- \( HG = x + 3 \)

**Relationships:**
- Opposite sides of a rectangle are equal, so \( EF = HG \).

**Positioning:**
- Diagonals \( EG \) and \( FH \) intersect at point \( K \).
- Point \( K \) lies on both diagonals, implying \( K \) is the midpoint of both diagonals.

**Special Geometric Constructions/Theorems:**
- Since \( EFGH \) is a rectangle, all angles are right angles.
- Diagonals of a rectangle are equal.

**Specific Value/Measurement Asked:**
- We need to find the length of \( EF \).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- Since \( EFGH \) is a rectangle, \( EF = HG \).
- Set the expressions for \( EF \) and \( HG \) equal to each other:
  \[
  4x - 6 = x + 3
  \]

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- Solve the equation \( 4x - 6 = x + 3 \) to find the value of \( x \).
- Substitute the value of \( x \) back into the expression for \( EF \) to find its length.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   4x - 6 = x + 3
   \]
   Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
   \[
   3x - 6 = 3
   \]
   Add 6 to both sides:
   \[
   3x = 9
   \]
   Divide by 3:
   \[
   x = 3
   \]

2. **Substitute \( x = 3 \) into \( EF = 4x - 6 \):**
   \[
   EF = 4(3) - 6 = 12 - 6 = 6
   \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- Verify: \( EF = 6 \) and \( HG = 3 + 3 = 6 \), which are equal, confirming the solution is consistent with the properties of a rectangle.
- Compare with answer choices: The calculated length of \( EF \) is 6, which matches choice A.
