To solve the problem, we will follow the structured approach outlined in the task.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Triangle(X,Y,Z)
- Line(A,B)
- Point(Y)

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- RightAngle(Angle(1))
- RightAngle(Angle(3))
- Equals(Angle(1), Angle(3))
- Angle(2)

**Relationships:**
- PointLiesOnLine(Point(Y), Line(A,B))
- Angle(Y,X,Z)
- Angle(X,Y,Z)
- Angle(X,Z,Y)

**Positioning:**
- Point(Y) lies on Line(A,B).

**Question:**
We need to determine which fact would be sufficient to prove that line d is parallel to XZ.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- We know that Angle(1) and Angle(3) are right angles and are equal, which implies they are both 90 degrees.
- The angles are related to the triangle XYZ, with Y lying on line AB.
- We need to establish a relationship between line d and line XZ using angles.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

To prove that line d is parallel to XZ, we can use the concept of corresponding angles or alternate interior angles formed by a transversal intersecting two lines. If we can show that one of these angle relationships holds, then line d is parallel to XZ.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Identify Relevant Angles:**
   - We have Angle(1) and Angle(3) as right angles, both equal to 90 degrees.
   - We need to relate these angles to angles involving line XZ.

2. **Consider the Given Choices:**
   - **A.** \(\angle 1 \cong \angle 3\): This is already given as a predicate and doesn't involve line XZ.
   - **B.** \(\angle 1 \cong \angle Z\): If \(\angle 1\) (90 degrees) is congruent to \(\angle Z\), then \(\angle Z\) is also 90 degrees. This implies that line XZ is perpendicular to a line through Y, which doesn't directly help with parallelism to line d.
   - **C.** \(\angle 2 \cong \angle X\): Without knowing the position of \(\angle 2\), this doesn't directly help.
   - **D.** \(\angle 3 \cong \angle Z\): If \(\angle 3\) (90 degrees) is congruent to \(\angle Z\), then \(\angle Z\) is also 90 degrees. This implies that line XZ is perpendicular to a line through Y.

3. **Apply Parallelism Theorem:**
   - If \(\angle 3 \cong \angle Z\) and \(\angle 3\) is a right angle, then line XZ is perpendicular to line AB.
   - If line d is also perpendicular to line AB, then line d is parallel to XZ by the definition of parallel lines (both perpendicular to the same line).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The fact that \(\angle 3 \cong \angle Z\) directly leads to the conclusion that line XZ is perpendicular to line AB, and if line d is also perpendicular to line AB, then line d is parallel to XZ.
- This reasoning aligns with the properties of parallel lines and perpendicular transversals.

Thus, the sufficient fact to prove that line d is parallel to XZ is:
