PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, let's follow the structured step-by-step approach.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes and Measurements:**
- Rectangle \(ABCD\)
- Diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\)
- Point \(E\) lies on both diagonals
- Lengths provided: \(AE = 1\), \(EC = 7\), \(BE = 6\), \(ED = 4\), \(AB = 2\), \(BD = 3\), \(AD = 5\), \(CD = 3\)

**Relationships:**
- \(E\) is the intersection of diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\)
- Diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other

**Specific Value to Find:**
- \(m \angle 8\), given \(m \angle 2 = 40^\circ\)

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

**Key Relationships:**
- Since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, \( \angle A = \angle B = \angle C = \angle D = 90^\circ\).
- Diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) bisect each other at \(E\), so \(E\) is the midpoint of both diagonals.
- \(AE + EC = AC\) and \(BE + ED = BD\).

**Using Lengths:**
- \(AC = AE + EC = 1 + 7 = 8\)
- \(BD = BE + ED = 6 + 4 = 10\)

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

**Theorems and Properties:**
- In a rectangle, diagonals are equal: \(AC = BD\).
- However, given lengths contradict this, suggesting a misinterpretation or additional geometric insight is needed.
- Use the fact that diagonals bisect each other and create congruent triangles.

**Plan:**
- Use the properties of intersecting diagonals and angles.
- Recognize that \( \angle 2\) and \( \angle 8\) are vertically opposite angles formed by intersecting diagonals.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

**Angle Relationships:**
- Since diagonals bisect each other, triangles \( \triangle ABE\), \( \triangle CDE\), \( \triangle ADE\), and \( \triangle CBE\) are formed.
- \( \angle AEB = \angle CED\) and \( \angle AED = \angle CEB\) due to vertical angles.
- Given \(m \angle 2 = 40^\circ\), \( \angle AEB = 40^\circ\).

**Finding \(m \angle 8\):**
- Since \( \angle AEB = \angle CED = 40^\circ\), and diagonals bisect each other, \( \angle 8 = \angle CED = 40^\circ\).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The problem setup and given angles confirm that \(m \angle 8 = 40^\circ\).
- The answer choice that matches this is \(A\).
