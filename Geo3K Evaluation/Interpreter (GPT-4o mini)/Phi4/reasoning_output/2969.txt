PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this geometric problem, we need to determine the measure of the minor arc \(\widehat{AC}\) given that the measure of \(\angle ABC\) is 70 degrees. Let's follow the structured approach:

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

- **Geometric Shapes**: We have a circle with points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on its circumference.
- **Measurements and Equalities**: 
  - \(m \angle ABC = 70^\circ\).
  - The degree measure of minor arc \(\widehat{AC}\) is \(x\).
  - The degree measure of major arc \(\widehat{ADC}\) is \(y\).
- **Relationships**:
  - \(\angle ABC\) is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc \(\widehat{AC}\).
  
- **Objective**: Find the measure \(x\) of the minor arc \(\widehat{AC}\).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- **Key Relationship**: 
  - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts. Therefore, \(m \angle ABC = \frac{x}{2}\).
  
### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- Use the relationship between the inscribed angle and the intercepted arc to find \(x\).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem**:
   \[
   m \angle ABC = \frac{x}{2}
   \]
   Given \(m \angle ABC = 70^\circ\), we substitute:
   \[
   70 = \frac{x}{2}
   \]

2. **Solve for \(x\)**:
   \[
   x = 2 \times 70 = 140
   \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- **Verification**: 
  - The measure of the minor arc \(\widehat{AC}\) is \(140^\circ\).
  - Since the total degrees in a circle is \(360^\circ\), the major arc \(\widehat{ADC}\) is \(360 - 140 = 220^\circ\).
  - This is consistent with the problem setup, as \(x + y = 360^\circ\).

- **Answer Choices**: 
  - The calculated \(x = 140^\circ\) does not match any of the provided answer choices directly. However, the problem asks for the degree measure of the minor arc \(\widehat{AC}\), and the closest reasonable choice considering typical exam settings (where options might be rounded or simplified) is \(140^\circ\).

- **Select the Closest Answer**: 
  - The closest answer choice to \(140^\circ\) is \(140^\circ\) itself, but since it is not an option, we must choose the closest provided option. The closest option is \(140^\circ\) being near \(120^\circ\).

Thus, the correct answer is:
