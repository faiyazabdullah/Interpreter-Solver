PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem of finding the length of CD in rhombus ABCD, we will follow a structured approach.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Points: A, B, C, D
- Lines: AB, BC, CD, DA, AC, BD
- Quadrilateral ABCD

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- AB = 2x + 3
- BC = x + 7

**Relationships:**
- Quadrilateral ABCD is a rhombus, implying all sides are equal: AB = BC = CD = DA.
- Diagonals AC and BD intersect at right angles and bisect each other.

**Special Theorems:**
- In a rhombus, all sides are equal.
- Diagonals bisect each other at right angles.

**Objective:**
- Find the length of CD.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

Since ABCD is a rhombus, we have:
- AB = BC = CD = DA

Given:
- AB = 2x + 3
- BC = x + 7

Since AB = BC in a rhombus, we set:
\[ 2x + 3 = x + 7 \]

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

Solve for x using the equation derived from the equality of sides:
\[ 2x + 3 = x + 7 \]

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. Solve the equation:
   \[
   2x + 3 = x + 7
   \]
   Subtract \(x\) from both sides:
   \[
   x + 3 = 7
   \]
   Subtract 3 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

2. Substitute \(x = 4\) back into the expression for AB (or BC, since they are equal):
   \[
   AB = 2x + 3 = 2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
   \]

3. Since AB = CD in a rhombus, we have:
   \[
   CD = 11
   \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- We have verified that all sides of the rhombus are equal and calculated CD as 11.
- Compare with the answer choices: A. 4, B. 11, C. 19, D. 20.

The correct choice is B.

Final Answer: B
