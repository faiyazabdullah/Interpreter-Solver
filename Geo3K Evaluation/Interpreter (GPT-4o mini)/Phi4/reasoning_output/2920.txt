====================================================================================================
Let's solve the problem step by step using the provided predicates.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Points: Q, R, S, T, U, V
- Lines: QR, UT, QU, RT, VS
- Trapezoid: UQRT

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- QR = 4
- UT = 16

**Relationships:**
- Parallel: QR || UT
- Parallel: VS || UT

**Positioning:**
- V and S are midpoints of the legs (QU and RT) of the trapezoid UQRT.

**Question:**
Find the length of VS.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

**Key Relationships:**
- Since V and S are midpoints of QU and RT, respectively, VS is the midsegment of trapezoid UQRT.
- In a trapezoid, the midsegment (line connecting the midpoints of the non-parallel sides) is parallel to the bases and its length is the average of the lengths of the two bases.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

**Theorem Application:**
- Use the midsegment theorem for trapezoids: The length of the midsegment is the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides (bases).

**Solution Path:**
1. Identify the lengths of the parallel sides (bases) of the trapezoid: QR and UT.
2. Apply the midsegment theorem to find VS.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

**Apply the Midsegment Theorem:**
- The length of the midsegment \( VS \) is given by:
  \[
  VS = \frac{QR + UT}{2}
  \]
- Substitute the known values:
  \[
  VS = \frac{4 + 16}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
  \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The calculated length of VS is 10.
- Compare with the answer choices: A. 5, B. 9, C. 10, D. 12.
- The correct choice is C.

Final Answer: C
