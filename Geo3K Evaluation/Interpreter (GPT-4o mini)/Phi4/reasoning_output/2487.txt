PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to determine the length \( FH \) given that \( GH = 10 \) and that circles \( G \), \( J \), and \( K \) intersect at point \( L \).

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Points: \( G, B, F, H, J, D, I, K, C, L \)
- Lines: \( BF, BH, HF, DK, CL \)
- Circles: \( G, J \)

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- \( GH = 10 \)

**Relationships:**
- Points \( B, H, F \) lie on circle \( G \).
- Points \( D, C, K \) lie on circle \( J \).
- Circles \( G, J, \) and \( K \) intersect at \( L \).

**Positioning:**
- \( L \) is a common point of intersection for circles \( G, J, \) and \( K \).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- Since \( B, H, F \) lie on circle \( G \), they are concyclic, meaning they form a cyclic quadrilateral with any other point on the circle.
- \( GH = 10 \) is a chord of circle \( G \).
- \( L \) is a point of intersection of circles \( G \) and \( J \), implying \( L \) is equidistant from the centers of these circles.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

We need to find \( FH \). Since \( B, H, F \) are on circle \( G \), \( \triangle GHF \) is inscribed in circle \( G \). We can use properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and triangles to find \( FH \).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Use the Power of a Point Theorem:**
   - Since \( L \) is a point of intersection of circles \( G \) and \( J \), the power of point \( L \) with respect to circle \( G \) is equal to the power of point \( L \) with respect to circle \( J \).
   - However, since \( L \) is on both circles, it simplifies to considering the segments formed by the chords through \( L \).

2. **Apply the Chord Length Formula:**
   - For circle \( G \), using the chord \( GH \) with length 10, we can find the perpendicular distance from the center of circle \( G \) to the chord \( GH \) using the formula:
     \[
     d = \sqrt{r^2 - \left(\frac{GH}{2}\right)^2}
     \]
   - Here, \( d \) is the perpendicular distance from the center to the chord, and \( r \) is the radius of circle \( G \).

3. **Use the Inscribed Angle Theorem:**
   - Since \( B, H, F \) are concyclic, the angle \( \angle GHF \) is subtended by the same arc as \( \angle GLF \) (where \( L \) is on the circle).
   - The length \( FH \) can be determined using the fact that \( \triangle GHF \) is isosceles with \( GH = 10 \).

4. **Calculate \( FH \):**
   - Since \( GH = 10 \) and \( \triangle GHF \) is isosceles with \( G \) as the center, \( FH \) must be equal to \( GH \) because \( G \) is equidistant from \( H \) and \( F \) on the circle.
   - Therefore, \( FH = GH = 10 \).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

The calculation shows that \( FH = 10 \), which matches one of the answer choices.
