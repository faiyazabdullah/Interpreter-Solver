Let's solve the problem step-by-step using the given predicates and geometric principles.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes and Points:**
- Circle B
- Points: M, L, N, B, P
- Lines: Line(M,L), Line(M,P), Line(N,P)

**Measurements and Angles:**
- Measure of Angle(N,M,L) = 36°
- Measure of Angle(N,L,B) = 78°
- Points N and P lie on Circle B.

**Relationships:**
- Line(M,L) is tangent to Circle(B) at point L.
- Line(M,P) is a secant line intersecting Circle(B) at points P and another point.
- Point L lies on the tangent line at point L, making angle(N,L,M) = 90° since tangent lines are perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency.

**Objective:**
- Find the measure of angle \( \widehat{L}P \) (inscribed angle subtended by arc LP).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- Since Line(M,L) is tangent to Circle B at L, and Line(M,P) is a secant, we can use the tangent-secant angle theorem.
- Angle(N,L,M) = 90° because L is the point of tangency.
- Using the angle sum property in triangle \( \triangle NLM \):
  \[
  \text{Measure of } \angle NLM = 180° - \angle NML - \angle NLM = 180° - 36° - 90° = 54°
  \]

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- We need to find the measure of the inscribed angle \( \angle LPB \).
- Use the tangent-secant angle theorem: The measure of the angle formed by a tangent and a chord through the point of contact is half the measure of the intercepted arc.
- Therefore, \( \angle NLM = \frac{1}{2} \text{Arc } NL \).
- Since \( \angle NLM = 54° \), Arc \( NL = 2 \times 54° = 108° \).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

- Now, consider the arc \( LP \). The measure of angle \( \angle NLB \) is given as 78°.
- Angle \( \angle NLB \) is an inscribed angle that subtends arc \( NP \).
- Therefore, Arc \( NP = 2 \times 78° = 156° \).

- The entire circle is 360°, so:
  \[
  \text{Arc } LP = 360° - \text{Arc } NL - \text{Arc } NP = 360° - 108° - 156° = 96°
  \]

- The inscribed angle \( \angle LPB \) subtends arc \( LB \), which is the remaining part of the circle:
  \[
  \text{Arc } LB = 360° - \text{Arc } LP = 360° - 96° = 264°
  \]

- The measure of the inscribed angle \( \angle LPB \) is half of arc \( LB \):
  \[
  \angle LPB = \frac{1}{2} \times 264° = 132°
  \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- We need to find \( m \widehat{L}P \), which is the measure of the angle subtended by arc \( LP \) at the circle.
- Since \( \angle LPB = 132° \), and considering the geometry, the correct interpretation of \( m \widehat{L}P \) is the angle subtended by arc \( LP \) at the circle, which is \( 180° - 132° = 48° \).
- However, since \( \angle LPB \) was calculated as 132°, and we need to find the angle opposite to it, we consider the remaining angle in the triangle \( \triangle LPB \) which is \( 180° - 132° = 48° \).
- Re-evaluate the setup: \( \angle LPB \) is not directly \( m \widehat{L}P \), but rather the calculation of arc \( LP \) was correct.
- Reconsider the calculation: \( \angle LPB = 132° \) implies \( m \widehat{L}P = 180° - 132° = 48° \).

Upon re-evaluation, the correct interpretation of \( m \widehat{L}P \) should be the angle subtended by arc \( LP \) at the circle, which is \( 180° - 132° = 48° \).

However, the choices provided do not include 48°, indicating a miscalculation or misinterpretation. Re-evaluate the setup:

- \( \angle NLM = 54° \) implies arc \( NL = 108° \).
- \( \angle NLB = 78° \) implies arc \( NP = 156° \).
- Arc \( LP = 96° \) implies \( \angle LPB = 48° \).
