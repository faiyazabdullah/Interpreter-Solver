PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we will follow the structured step-by-step solution process outlined above.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

- **Geometric Shape**: We are given a rectangle \(WXYZ\).
- **Measurements and Equalities**: We know \(m \angle 1 = 30^\circ\).
- **Relationships**: Since \(WXYZ\) is a rectangle, all angles are \(90^\circ\).
- **Specific Value**: We need to find \(m \angle 5\).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- **Key Relationships**:
  - In a rectangle, opposite angles are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary.
  - If \(\angle 1\) is part of a triangle or another configuration within the rectangle, it could affect the measure of \(\angle 5\).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- **Theorems and Properties**:
  - Use the properties of rectangles and triangles.
  - Consider the possibility of \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 5\) being part of a triangle or related by parallel lines.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Identify Configuration**:
   - Assume \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 5\) are part of a triangle formed by a diagonal of the rectangle or a line parallel to one of its sides.
   - If \(\angle 1\) is an angle formed by a diagonal intersecting a side, then \(\angle 5\) could be the angle adjacent to \(\angle 1\) on the same line.

2. **Apply Angle Properties**:
   - If \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 5\) are angles on a straight line, they are supplementary:
     \[
     m \angle 1 + m \angle 5 = 180^\circ
     \]
   - Substitute the known value:
     \[
     30^\circ + m \angle 5 = 180^\circ
     \]
   - Solve for \(m \angle 5\):
     \[
     m \angle 5 = 180^\circ - 30^\circ = 150^\circ
     \]

3. **Consider Alternate Configurations**:
   - If \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 5\) are angles in a right triangle formed by a diagonal:
     - The diagonal divides the rectangle into two congruent right triangles.
     - If \(\angle 1\) is \(30^\circ\), then the angle opposite it in the right triangle (let's call it \(\angle 5\)) could be \(60^\circ\) because the angles in a triangle sum to \(180^\circ\).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- **Verification**:
  - In a right triangle, if one angle is \(30^\circ\), the other non-right angle must be \(60^\circ\).
  - This matches the configuration where \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 5\) are angles in a right triangle formed by a diagonal.

- **Answer Choice**:
  - The calculated measure of \(\angle 5\) is \(60^\circ\).
