To solve the problem, we need to determine the measure of angle \( \angle KML \) in the given geometric configuration. Let's break down the problem step-by-step using the provided predicates and relevant geometric principles.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- \( JKLM \) is a rectangle.
- \( MLPR \) is a rhombus.

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- \( \angle JMK \cong \angle RMP \)
- \( m \angle JMK = 55^\circ \)
- \( m \angle MRP = 70^\circ \)

**Relationships:**
- Opposite angles in a rectangle are equal.
- All sides of a rhombus are equal.
- Diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.

**Objective:**
- Find \( m \angle KML \).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

**Key Relationships:**
- Since \( JKLM \) is a rectangle, \( \angle JMK = \angle KML = 55^\circ \) because opposite angles in a rectangle are equal.
- \( MLPR \) being a rhombus implies \( ML = LP = PR = RM \).
- Diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, so \( \angle MRP = 70^\circ \) implies that \( \angle MRP \) is split into two \( 35^\circ \) angles by the diagonal \( MR \).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

**Direct Path:**
- Use the fact that \( \angle JMK \cong \angle RMP \) and both are \( 55^\circ \).
- Since \( \angle JMK = 55^\circ \) and \( JKLM \) is a rectangle, \( \angle KML = 55^\circ \).

**Verification:**
- Check if the configuration and angle measures are consistent with the properties of a rectangle and rhombus.
- Since \( \angle JMK = \angle KML \) in rectangle \( JKLM \), and both are \( 55^\circ \), the setup is consistent.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

- Given \( \angle JMK = 55^\circ \) and \( JKLM \) is a rectangle, \( \angle KML = 55^\circ \).
- The problem asks for \( m \angle KML \), which we have determined to be \( 55^\circ \).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- Verify that \( \angle KML = 55^\circ \) is consistent with the rectangle's properties.
- Compare \( 55^\circ \) with the answer choices:
  - A. 35
  - B. 70
  - C. 110
  - D. 140

The closest match to \( 55^\circ \) is not directly listed, but considering the problem's setup and the congruence \( \angle JMK \cong \angle KML \), the correct interpretation is that \( \angle KML \) should be calculated as \( 180^\circ - 70^\circ - 55^\circ = 55^\circ \), which is consistent with the rectangle's properties.

Thus, the correct answer is \( 70^\circ \) when considering the supplementary angles in the rhombus configuration.
