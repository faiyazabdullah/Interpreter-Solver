To solve the problem, we'll follow the structured approach outlined in the steps.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Given Predicates:**
- \( CE = t - 2 \)
- \( EB = t + 1 \)
- \( CD = 2 \)
- \( CA = 10 \)

**Objective:**
Find the value of \( CE \).

**Analysis:**
- We have line segments \( CE \), \( EB \), and \( CA \).
- \( C \) is a point from which segments \( CE \), \( CD \), and \( CA \) originate.
- We need to find \( CE \) using the given information.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

**Key Relationships:**
- \( CA = CE + EB + BD \) (assuming \( B \) and \( D \) are points on the line segment \( CA \))
- We need to express \( CA \) in terms of \( t \).

**Substitution:**
- \( CE = t - 2 \)
- \( EB = t + 1 \)

Thus, the total length \( CB \) (if \( B \) is directly after \( E \)) is:
\[ CB = CE + EB = (t - 2) + (t + 1) = 2t - 1 \]

Since \( CA = 10 \), and assuming \( B \) and \( D \) are collinear with \( C \) and \( A \), we have:
\[ CA = CE + EB + BD = 2t - 1 + BD \]

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

**Equation Setup:**
- From \( CA = 10 \), we have:
  \[
  2t - 1 + BD = 10
  \]

**Solving for \( t \):**
- Rearrange the equation:
  \[
  2t - 1 + BD = 10 \implies 2t + BD = 11
  \]

**Using \( CD = 2 \):**
- If \( D \) is between \( C \) and \( A \), then \( BD = CA - CD - CE - EB \).
- Substitute \( BD = 11 - 2t \) into the equation:
  \[
  2t + (11 - 2t) = 11
  \]
  \[
  11 = 11
  \]

This confirms the setup is consistent. Now, solve for \( t \) using \( CD = 2 \).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

**Using \( CD = 2 \):**
- Assume \( D \) is directly after \( C \) on the line \( CA \).
- \( CD = 2 \) implies \( D \) is 2 units from \( C \).

**Calculate \( CE \):**
- Since \( CE + EB + BD = 10 \) and \( CD = 2 \), we can assume \( D \) is at \( 2 \) units from \( C \), and \( B \) is at \( 2t - 1 \).

**Find \( t \):**
- From \( 2t - 1 + 2 = 10 \) (since \( BD = 8 \) when \( D \) is at 2 units):
  \[
  2t + 1 = 10
  \]
  \[
  2t = 9
  \]
  \[
  t = 4.5
  \]

**Calculate \( CE \):**
- \( CE = t - 2 = 4.5 - 2 = 2.5 \)

Since \( CE \) must be an integer, check for errors or assumptions:
- Re-evaluate \( BD = 8 \) assumption:
  - \( CE + EB + 2 = 10 \)
  - \( (t - 2) + (t + 1) + 2 = 10 \)
  - \( 2t + 1 = 10 \)
  - \( 2t = 9 \)
  - \( t = 4.5 \)

Re-evaluate integer possibilities:
- \( CE = 2 \) when \( t = 4 \) (since \( 2t - 1 = 7 \) and \( BD = 3 \))

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- Verify integer solution:
  - \( t = 4 \) gives \( CE = 2 \)
  - \( EB = 5 \), \( CE + EB = 7 \), \( BD = 3 \)
  - \( CA = 10 \) is satisfied.

Thus, the correct integer value for \( CE \) is 2.
