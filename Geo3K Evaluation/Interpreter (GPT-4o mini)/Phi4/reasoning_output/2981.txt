PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Predicate Analysis and Setup

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Rhombus ABCD with diagonals BD and CA.

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- Length of BD = 12.
- Length of CA = 22.
- Perpendicular diagonals: BD ‚ä• CA.

**Relationships:**
- Diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.

**Question:**
- Find the area of the rhombus.

**Special Constructions/Theorems:**
- Area of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula involving its diagonals: \(\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2\), where \(d_1\) and \(d_2\) are the lengths of the diagonals.

### Step 2: Constraint Synthesis

- Diagonals bisect each other at right angles, forming four right triangles.
- The lengths of the diagonals are given: BD = 12 and CA = 22.
- The diagonals divide each other into equal segments: 
  - BD is divided into two segments of 6 each.
  - CA is divided into two segments of 11 each.

### Step 3: Solution Strategy

- Use the formula for the area of a rhombus with given diagonals: \(\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2\).
- Substitute the known diagonal lengths into the formula.

### Step 4: Mathematical Derivation

- Given:
  - \(d_1 = 12\) (length of BD)
  - \(d_2 = 22\) (length of CA)

- Area calculation:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \times 22
  \]

- Simplify the expression:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 264 = 132
  \]

### Step 5: Verification and Answer Selection

- The calculated area is 132, which matches one of the provided answer choices.
- Verify that the calculation aligns with the properties of a rhombus and the given measurements.
