To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given geometric predicates and apply relevant geometric principles.

### Step 1: Predicate Analysis and Setup

- **Points and Lines:**
  - Points: \( P, N, M, L, J, I, K \)
  - Lines: \( \overline{PN}, \overline{NM}, \overline{ML}, \overline{LP}, \overline{PM}, \overline{NL}, \overline{NI}, \overline{IK}, \overline{KM} \)

- **Shapes:**
  - Quadrilateral \( PNMK \) is a rectangle.
  - Quadrilateral \( NIKM \) is a parallelogram.

- **Measurements and Equalities:**
  - \( LN = 10 \)
  - \( LJ = 2x + 1 \)
  - \( PJ = 3x - 1 \)

- **Objective:**
  - Find the value of \( x \).

### Step 2: Constraint Synthesis

- **Rectangle \( PNMK \):**
  - Opposite sides are equal: \( PN = MK \) and \( NM = LP \).
  - All angles are right angles.

- **Parallelogram \( LKJM \):**
  - Opposite sides are equal: \( LK = JM \) and \( KJ = LM \).
  - Opposite angles are equal.

### Step 3: Solution Strategy

- Since \( PNMK \) is a rectangle, \( PN \) is parallel and equal to \( MK \), and \( NM \) is parallel and equal to \( LP \).

- Since \( LKJM \) is a parallelogram, \( LK \parallel JM \) and \( KJ \parallel LM \).

- Use the fact that \( LN = 10 \) and \( LKJM \) is a parallelogram to find relationships between \( LJ \) and \( PJ \).

### Step 4: Mathematical Derivation

1. **Using the Rectangle \( PNMK \):**
   - Since \( LN = 10 \) and \( LKJM \) is a parallelogram, \( LJ \) and \( KJ \) are diagonals of the parallelogram.
   - In a rectangle, diagonals are equal: \( PN = MK \) and \( NM = LP \).

2. **Using the Parallelogram \( LKJM \):**
   - Diagonals bisect each other: \( LJ = KJ \) and \( LM = KJ \).

3. **Equations from Given Measurements:**
   - \( LJ = 2x + 1 \)
   - \( PJ = 3x - 1 \)

4. **Using Diagonal Properties:**
   - Since \( PJ \) is a diagonal of the rectangle \( PNMK \), and \( LJ \) is a diagonal of the parallelogram \( LKJM \), and they intersect at \( J \), we can use the properties of diagonals in these shapes.

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Since \( LJ = KJ \) and \( PJ \) is a diagonal of the rectangle, we equate the expressions for \( LJ \) and \( PJ \) using the properties of the rectangle and parallelogram:
   - \( LJ = PJ \) (since they are diagonals intersecting at \( J \) and \( LJ = KJ \) in parallelogram)
   - \( 2x + 1 = 3x - 1 \)

6. **Solve the Equation:**
   \[
   2x + 1 = 3x - 1
   \]
   \[
   1 + 1 = 3x - 2x
   \]
   \[
   2 = x
   \]

### Step 5: Verification and Answer Selection

- Verify: Substituting \( x = 2 \) back into the expressions:
  - \( LJ = 2(2) + 1 = 5 \)
  - \( PJ = 3(2) - 1 = 5 \)
  - Both are equal, confirming the solution is correct.

- Compare with answer choices:
  - \( x = 2 \) corresponds to choice A.
