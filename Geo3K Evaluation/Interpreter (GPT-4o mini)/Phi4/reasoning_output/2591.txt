====================================================================================================
PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to determine how many sides a regular polygon has when it shares two vertices with a square and a pentagon, specifically when sides \(XY\) and \(XZ\) are sides of this polygon.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

1. **Geometric Shapes:**
   - Square: \(Square(Y, C, B, X)\)
   - Pentagon: \(Pentagon(X, B, D, A, Z)\)
   - Points: \(Y, C, B, X, Z, D, A\)

2. **Lines:**
   - Lines form the sides of the square and pentagon: \(Line(Y, X), Line(X, C), Line(C, B), Line(B, Y)\)
   - Lines form the sides of the pentagon: \(Line(X, Z), Line(B, D), Line(Z, A), Line(D, A), Line(Z, X), Line(A, D)\)

3. **Objective:**
   - Determine the number of sides of a regular polygon that shares vertices \(X\) with both the square and the pentagon, and has \(XY\) and \(XZ\) as sides.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- **Square Properties:**
  - All sides are equal: \(XY = YC = CB = BX\)
  - All angles are \(90^\circ\).

- **Pentagon Properties:**
  - All sides are equal: \(XB = BD = DA = AZ = ZX\)
  - Internal angles are \(108^\circ\).

- **Shared Vertex:**
  - \(X\) is a common vertex for both the square and the pentagon.
  - \(XY\) is a side of the square, and \(XZ\) is a side of the pentagon.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- **Angle at Vertex \(X\):**
  - In the square, \(\angle YXC = 90^\circ\).
  - In the pentagon, \(\angle ZXV = 108^\circ\) (where \(V\) is the next vertex in the pentagon after \(Z\)).

- **Angle Between \(XY\) and \(XZ\):**
  - The angle between \(XY\) and \(XZ\) is \(\angle YXZ = 360^\circ - (90^\circ + 108^\circ) = 162^\circ\).

- **Regular Polygon:**
  - For a regular polygon with \(n\) sides, each internal angle is \(\frac{(n-2) \times 180^\circ}{n}\).
  - The external angle is \(180^\circ - \frac{(n-2) \times 180^\circ}{n} = \frac{360^\circ}{n}\).

- **Determine \(n\):**
  - We need the external angle to be \(162^\circ\).
  - Set \(\frac{360^\circ}{n} = 162^\circ\).
  - Solve for \(n\): \(n = \frac{360^\circ}{162^\circ} = \frac{360}{162} = \frac{180}{81} = \frac{20}{9}\).

- **Calculate \(n\):**
  - Since \(n\) must be an integer, multiply numerator and denominator by 9 to clear the fraction: \(n = 20\).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

- The calculation confirms that the regular polygon has 20 sides, as \(n = 20\) satisfies the condition for the external angle.

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The calculated number of sides is 20, which matches one of the provided answer choices.
