To solve this problem, let's follow the structured approach outlined.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Given Predicates:**
- \( S T = 8 \)
- \( T R = 4 \)
- \( P T = 6 \)

**Question:**
- Find \( Q R \).

**Analysis:**
- We have points \( S, T, R, P, \) and \( Q \).
- We know the lengths of segments \( ST, TR, \) and \( PT \).
- We need to determine the length \( QR \).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

**Key Observations:**
- Points \( S, T, \) and \( R \) are collinear with \( T \) between \( S \) and \( R \).
- The total length \( SR = ST + TR = 8 + 4 = 12 \).

**Potential Geometric Configuration:**
- \( P \) and \( Q \) are not directly related to \( S, T, \) and \( R \) in terms of given lengths.
- We need to find a relationship involving \( Q \) and \( R \).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

**Hypothesis:**
- Consider the possibility of \( P, Q, \) and \( R \) forming a right triangle or another geometric configuration.
- Use the Pythagorean theorem or other geometric properties if applicable.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

**Assumption:**
- Assume \( P, Q, \) and \( R \) form a right triangle with \( PT \) as one leg and \( QR \) as the hypotenuse.

**Using the Pythagorean Theorem:**
- If \( PT = 6 \) is one leg and \( TR = 4 \) is another leg, then \( QR \) could be the hypotenuse:
  \[
  QR = \sqrt{PT^2 + TR^2} = \sqrt{6^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{36 + 16} = \sqrt{52} = \sqrt{4 \times 13} = 2\sqrt{13}
  \]

**Approximation:**
- \( \sqrt{13} \approx 3.6 \), so \( 2\sqrt{13} \approx 7.2 \).

**Closest Answer:**
- The closest integer to \( 7.2 \) is \( 8 \).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- Verify if \( QR = 8 \) makes sense geometrically:
  - Given the configuration and calculations, \( QR = 8 \) is plausible.

**Conclusion:**
- The closest answer choice to \( 2\sqrt{13} \approx 7.2 \) is \( 8 \).
