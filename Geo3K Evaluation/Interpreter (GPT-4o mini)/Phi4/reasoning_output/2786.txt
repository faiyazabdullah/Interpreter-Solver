Let's solve the problem using the structured approach outlined.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Points: W, X, Y, Z, A
- Lines: WX, XY, WY, XZ, WZ, YZ, ZA
- Triangle: WXY (Isosceles)
- Right Angle: ∠WZY

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- Length(XY) = 12
- Length(WZ) = Length(YZ)

**Relationships:**
- Triangle WXY is isosceles, meaning two sides are equal.
- ∠WZY is a right angle.

**Question:**
We need to find the length of W (denoted as XW).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

**Key Relationships:**
1. Triangle WXY is isosceles. Since XY = 12, WX = WY or WX = XY or WY = XY.
2. ∠WZY is a right angle, indicating triangle WZY is a right triangle.
3. Length(WZ) = Length(YZ) implies triangle WZY is isosceles with WZ = YZ.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

**Approach:**
- Use the properties of the isosceles triangle WXY and right triangle WZY.
- Apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle WZY.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Triangle WXY (Isosceles):**
   - Assume WX = WY (since WXY is isosceles and XY = 12).
   - Let WX = WY = a.

2. **Triangle WZY (Right Isosceles):**
   - WZ = YZ = b (given WZ = YZ).
   - Apply the Pythagorean theorem: \( WZ^2 + YZ^2 = ZY^2 \).
   - Since WZ = YZ, \( 2b^2 = ZY^2 \).

3. **Find ZY:**
   - ZY is the hypotenuse of the right triangle WZY.
   - \( ZY = \sqrt{2}b \).

4. **Use the Isosceles Triangle Property:**
   - Since WX = WY = a and XY = 12, use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle WXY:
   - \( a^2 + a^2 = 12^2 \) (if WX = WY and XY is the base).
   - \( 2a^2 = 144 \).
   - \( a^2 = 72 \).
   - \( a = \sqrt{72} = 6\sqrt{2} \).

5. **Relate WZ and WX:**
   - Since WZ = YZ and WZ = WX (as WX = WY and WXY is isosceles), we have:
   - \( b = 6\sqrt{2} \).

6. **Calculate ZY:**
   - \( ZY = \sqrt{2}b = \sqrt{2} \times 6\sqrt{2} = 12 \).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- We found that WX = WY = 6√2.
- Since \( 6\sqrt{2} \approx 8.49 \), and the closest integer value in the choices is 6, we need to verify if this matches any choice directly.
- The length of WX (XW) is 6√2, which simplifies to approximately 8.49, but the closest integer value that matches the problem's context is 6.

Thus, the correct answer is:
