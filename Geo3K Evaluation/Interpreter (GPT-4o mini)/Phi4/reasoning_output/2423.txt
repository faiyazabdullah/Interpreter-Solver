PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

We are given:
- A triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
- The lengths of the sides are expressed in terms of \( x \):
  - \( AB = 2x - 7 \)
  - \( BC = 4x - 21 \)
  - \( AC = x - 3 \)

The problem specifies that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB \cong BC \). This means \( AB = BC \).

**Goal**: Find the value of \( x \) and subsequently determine \( AB \).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

Since \( AB \cong BC \), we set the expressions for these sides equal to each other:
\[ 2x - 7 = 4x - 21 \]

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

Solve the equation \( 2x - 7 = 4x - 21 \) to find \( x \).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

Start solving the equation:
\[ 2x - 7 = 4x - 21 \]

1. Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:
   \[
   -7 = 2x - 21
   \]

2. Add 21 to both sides:
   \[
   14 = 2x
   \]

3. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 7
   \]

Now, substitute \( x = 7 \) back into the expression for \( AB \) to find its length:
\[ AB = 2x - 7 = 2(7) - 7 = 14 - 7 = 7 \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

Verify if \( x = 7 \) satisfies the condition \( AB = BC \):
- \( AB = 2(7) - 7 = 7 \)
- \( BC = 4(7) - 21 = 28 - 21 = 7 \)

Both \( AB \) and \( BC \) are indeed equal, confirming \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB \cong BC \).

The length of \( AB \) is 7, which matches answer choice C.
