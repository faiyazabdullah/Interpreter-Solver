QUESTION:

PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem of finding the distance \( JK \) between the centers of circles \( J \) and \( K \), we will apply the given information and use the properties of circles and the Pythagorean theorem.

### Step 1: Predicate Analysis and Setup

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Circle \( J \) with center \( J \) and radius 10 units.
- Circle \( K \) with center \( K \) and radius 8 units.

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- \( BC = 5.4 \) units, where \( B \) and \( C \) are points on circles \( J \) and \( K \) respectively.

**Relationships and Positioning:**
- \( B \) is on circle \( J \), so \( JB = 10 \).
- \( C \) is on circle \( K \), so \( KC = 8 \).

### Step 2: Constraint Synthesis

We need to find the distance \( JK \) between the centers of the circles. The key is to use the triangle \( \triangle JBC \).

### Step 3: Solution Strategy

We will use the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle JBC \) to find \( JK \).

### Step 4: Mathematical Derivation

In \( \triangle JBC \), we have:
- \( JB = 10 \)
- \( KC = 8 \)
- \( BC = 5.4 \)

Using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
JB^2 = JK^2 + BC^2 + KC^2
\]

Rearranging for \( JK \):
\[
JK^2 = JB^2 + KC^2 - BC^2
\]

Substitute the known values:
\[
JK^2 = 10^2 + 8^2 - 5.4^2
\]

Calculate each term:
- \( 10^2 = 100 \)
- \( 8^2 = 64 \)
- \( 5.4^2 = 29.16 \)

Substitute back:
\[
JK^2 = 100 + 64 - 29.16 = 134.84
\]

Calculate \( JK \):
\[
JK = \sqrt{134.84} \approx 11.61
\]

### Step 5: Verification and Answer Selection

The calculated distance \( JK \approx 11.61 \) does not directly match any of the given answer choices. However, we should consider the closest option.

The closest answer choice to \( 11.61 \) is \( 12.6 \).
