Let's solve the given geometric problem step-by-step by analyzing the predicates and applying relevant geometric principles.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - Circle \( B \) is given.
  - Points on circle \( B \): \( J, K, G, F \).
  - Points \( H \) and \( C \) are mentioned, but their positions are not specified as being on the circle.
  - Points \( G, J, H, F, K, C \) are all considered as part of the problem.

- **Angles:**
  - \( \angle(G, J, H) \) and \( \angle(F, K, C) \) are given.
  - Two angles are explicitly given: \( \angle = 26 \) and \( \angle = 88 \).

- **Objective:**
  - Find \( m \angle H \).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS
- Points \( J, K, G, F \) lie on circle \( B \), which suggests they might form cyclic quadrilaterals or be part of an inscribed angle scenario.
- The angles \( \angle(G, J, H) \) and \( \angle(F, K, C) \) are likely inscribed angles because they involve three points, two of which lie on the circle.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY
- **Inscribed Angle Theorem:**
  - An inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.
  - If \( \angle(G, J, H) \) is an inscribed angle, then the arc \( GH \) is subtended by this angle.

- **Given Angles:**
  - We have \( \angle = 26 \) and \( \angle = 88 \). These could be the measures of the inscribed angles or related angles.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION
- **Assumption:**
  - Assume \( \angle(G, J, H) = 26^\circ \). This is a reasonable assumption because it is one of the given angles and fits the context of inscribed angles.

- **Inscribed Angle Calculation:**
  - If \( \angle(G, J, H) = 26^\circ \), then the arc \( GH \) is subtended by this angle.
  - The central angle \( \angle GJH \) would be \( 2 \times 26^\circ = 52^\circ \).

- **Finding \( m \angle H \):**
  - If \( \angle(G, J, H) = 26^\circ \), then \( m \angle H \) could be the other angle in a triangle or related configuration.
  - Consider \( \angle(F, K, C) = 88^\circ \) as another inscribed angle.
  - If \( \angle(F, K, C) = 88^\circ \), then the arc \( FC \) is subtended by this angle.
  - The central angle \( \angle FKC \) would be \( 2 \times 88^\circ = 176^\circ \).

- **Cyclic Quadrilateral:**
  - If \( G, J, K, F \) form a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles sum to \( 180^\circ \).
  - Thus, if \( \angle(G, J, H) = 26^\circ \), then \( \angle(F, K, C) = 88^\circ \) implies \( \angle H = 180^\circ - 88^\circ = 92^\circ \).

- **Re-evaluation:**
  - Since \( \angle H \) is not directly \( 92^\circ \), consider the possibility of \( \angle H \) being related to another configuration.
  - If \( \angle(G, J, H) = 26^\circ \), and considering \( \angle(F, K, C) = 88^\circ \), the remaining angle in a triangle or related configuration could be \( 62^\circ \) (since \( 180^\circ - 26^\circ - 92^\circ = 62^\circ \)).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION
- Verify the calculations:
  - \( \angle(G, J, H) = 26^\circ \) and \( \angle(F, K, C) = 88^\circ \) are consistent with the given angles.
  - The remaining angle \( m \angle H \) in a triangle or related configuration is \( 62^\circ \).

- **Conclusion:**
  - The most consistent value for \( m \angle H \) given the predicates and geometric reasoning is \( 62^\circ \).
