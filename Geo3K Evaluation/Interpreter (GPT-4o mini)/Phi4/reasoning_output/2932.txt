Let's tackle the problem step-by-step according to the structured approach provided.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Trapezoid \(ABCD\)
- Points \(S\) and \(T\) are midpoints of the legs \(AD\) and \(BC\) respectively.

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- \(CD = 14\)
- \(ST = 10\)
- \(AB = 2x\)

**Relationships:**
- \(AB \parallel CD\) (Trapezoid property)
- \(ST \parallel AB\) and \(ST \parallel CD\) (Midsegment theorem)

**Question:**
- Find \(x\) given \(AB = 2x\).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

**Key Relationships:**
- The line segment \(ST\) is the midsegment of trapezoid \(ABCD\).
- By the midsegment theorem for trapezoids, the midsegment \(ST\) is parallel to the bases \(AB\) and \(CD\) and its length is the average of the lengths of the bases.

**Formula from Midsegment Theorem:**
\[
ST = \frac{AB + CD}{2}
\]

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

**Apply the Midsegment Theorem:**
- Use the formula for the midsegment to express \(ST\) in terms of \(AB\) and \(CD\).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. Substitute the known values into the midsegment formula:
   \[
   10 = \frac{2x + 14}{2}
   \]

2. Solve for \(x\):
   \[
   10 = \frac{2x + 14}{2}
   \]

3. Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   20 = 2x + 14
   \]

4. Subtract 14 from both sides:
   \[
   6 = 2x
   \]

5. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 3
   \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The calculated value \(x = 3\) is consistent with the given conditions and the application of the midsegment theorem.
- Compare with the answer choices: A. 2, B. 3, C. 10, D. 14.
- The correct choice is B.

Final Answer: B
