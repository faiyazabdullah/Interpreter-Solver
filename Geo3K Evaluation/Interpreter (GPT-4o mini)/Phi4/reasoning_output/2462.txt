QUESTION:
A B is a diameter, A C = 8 inches, and B C = 15 inches. Find the radius of the circle.

CHOICES:
A. 7.5
B. 8
C. 8.5
D. 17

PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we will follow the structured approach outlined in the task.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Points: A, B, C
- Circle: Center at O (since AB is a diameter)

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- A C = 8 inches
- B C = 15 inches
- A B is a diameter

**Relationships:**
- A B is a straight line through the center of the circle (diameter)
- Points A, B, and C are on the circle

**Specific Value Needed:**
- We need to find the radius of the circle.

**Special Constructions/Theorems:**
- Use the Pythagorean theorem for right triangles.
- The diameter is twice the radius.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- Since A B is a diameter, the center O of the circle is the midpoint of A B.
- Triangle A C B is a right triangle with the right angle at C (Thales' theorem: angle in a semicircle is a right angle).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- Use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle A C B:
  \[
  A C^2 + C B^2 = A B^2
  \]
- Substitute the known values:
  \[
  8^2 + 15^2 = A B^2
  \]
- Solve for \( A B \).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. Calculate \( A C^2 \):
   \[
   8^2 = 64
   \]

2. Calculate \( B C^2 \):
   \[
   15^2 = 225
   \]

3. Substitute into the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   64 + 225 = A B^2
   \]

4. Simplify:
   \[
   289 = A B^2
   \]

5. Solve for \( A B \):
   \[
   A B = \sqrt{289} = 17
   \]

6. Since A B is the diameter, the radius \( r \) is half of A B:
   \[
   r = \frac{17}{2} = 8.5
   \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The calculated radius is 8.5 inches.
- Compare with answer choices:
  - A. 7.5
  - B. 8
  - C. 8.5
  - D. 17

The correct answer is C.
