To solve the given geometric problem, we'll follow the structured approach outlined in the task. Let's go through each step systematically.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes and Points:**
- Circle centered at \( O \).
- Points: \( A, B, C, D, E, F \).
- Lines: \( \overline{AB}, \overline{DF} \).
- Radii: \( \overline{OC}, \overline{OE} \).

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- Right angles: \( \angle CBA \) and \( \angle EFD \).
- Arc measurement: \( \text{Arc } AD = 2x + 14 \).
- Line segment length: \( \overline{CE} = 9x \).

**Relationships:**
- \( \overline{AB} \cong \overline{DF} \).

**Objective:**
- Find the value of \( x \).

**Special Constructions/Theorems:**
- Right angles suggest perpendicular lines or triangles.
- Equal radii suggest potential use of circle theorems.
- Congruent segments suggest potential use of triangle congruence or symmetry.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

**Key Relationships:**
- Since \( \angle CBA \) and \( \angle EFD \) are right angles, \( \overline{CB} \) is perpendicular to \( \overline{AB} \) and \( \overline{EF} \) is perpendicular to \( \overline{DF} \).
- \( \overline{OC} \) and \( \overline{OE} \) are radii of the circle, hence \( \overline{OC} = \overline{OE} \).
- \( \overline{AB} \cong \overline{DF} \) implies these segments are equal in length.

**Circle Properties:**
- The measure of arc \( AD \) is given by \( 2x + 14 \).
- The length \( \overline{CE} = 9x \).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

To find \( x \), we need to relate the given information:
- Use the congruence \( \overline{AB} \cong \overline{DF} \).
- Utilize the fact that \( \overline{OC} = \overline{OE} \) (radii of the circle).
- Consider the implications of the right angles and the circle's properties.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Right Angles and Radii:**
   - Since \( \angle CBA \) and \( \angle EFD \) are right angles, and \( \overline{OC} \) and \( \overline{OE} \) are radii, \( \triangle OCB \) and \( \triangle OFD \) are right triangles with \( \overline{OC} = \overline{OE} \).

2. **Congruence and Equal Lengths:**
   - \( \overline{AB} \cong \overline{DF} \) implies these segments are equal.
   - Since \( \overline{OC} = \overline{OE} \), and both are radii, they are equal.

3. **Arc and Line Segment Relationship:**
   - The measure of arc \( AD \) is \( 2x + 14 \).
   - The length \( \overline{CE} = 9x \).

4. **Relating Arc and Chord:**
   - Since \( \overline{OC} = \overline{OE} \), \( \triangle OCE \) is isosceles.
   - The arc \( AD \) subtends the angle at the center, which is related to the chord \( \overline{CE} \).

5. **Using Geometry:**
   - In a circle, the length of a chord can be related to the arc it subtends using the formula for the chord length in terms of the radius and the angle subtended at the center.
   - However, since we have \( \overline{CE} = 9x \) and the arc \( AD = 2x + 14 \), we can equate these relationships by considering the symmetry and properties of the circle.

6. **Equating and Solving:**
   - Since \( \overline{OC} = \overline{OE} \) and \( \angle CBA \) and \( \angle EFD \) are right angles, the segments \( \overline{CB} \) and \( \overline{EF} \) are equal due to symmetry.
   - The arc \( AD \) and the chord \( \overline{CE} \) are related through the circle's geometry.
   - Equate the expressions for the arc and the chord length:
     \[
     2x + 14 = 9x
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     9x = 2x + 14 \\
     9x - 2x = 14 \\
     7x = 14 \\
     x = 2
     \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- Verify: The calculation \( 7x = 14 \) leading to \( x = 2 \) is consistent with the geometric relationships and constraints.
- Compare with answer choices: \( x = 2 \) matches choice B.
