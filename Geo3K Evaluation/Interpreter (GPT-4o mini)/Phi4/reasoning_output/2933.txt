Let's solve the problem step-by-step using the given predicates and geometric reasoning.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes and Lines:**
- Points: A, B, C, D, E, F, G
- Lines: Line(D,B), Line(C,B), Line(F,B), Line(E,B), Line(A,B), Line(G,B)

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- RightAngle(Angle(D,B,E)) implies that ∠DBE is a right angle (90°).
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(E,B,C)), 37°) tells us that ∠EBC = 37°.

**Objective:**
- Find m∠1, which we assume to be ∠CBE, given the context of the problem.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

**Key Relationships:**
- Since ∠DBE is a right angle, we know that ∠DBE = 90°.
- ∠EBC = 37° is given.

**Triangle Analysis:**
- Consider triangle ∆DBE. Since ∠DBE is a right angle, we can use the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°.
- In ∆DBE, the angles are ∠DBE, ∠BDE, and ∠BED.
- We know ∠DBE = 90° and ∠EBD = 37° (since ∠EBC = 37° and B is a common point).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

**Finding m∠1:**
- We need to find m∠1, which is ∠CBE.
- Since ∠EBD = 37°, and ∠DBE = 90°, we can find ∠BDE using the triangle angle sum property:
  \[
  \text{Sum of angles in } \triangle DBE = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  \angle DBE + \angle EBD + \angle BDE = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  90^\circ + 37^\circ + \angle BDE = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  \angle BDE = 180^\circ - 127^\circ = 53^\circ
  \]

- Since ∠CBE is the same as ∠BDE (as they are vertically opposite angles or simply the same angle due to the linearity of points C, B, and E), we have:
  \[
  m\angle 1 = \angle CBE = \angle BDE = 53^\circ
  \]

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

- We have derived that m∠1 = 53° using the properties of triangles and angle sums.

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The calculated value of m∠1 is 53°.
- Comparing with the answer choices:
  - A. 37
  - B. 45
  - C. 53
  - D. 63

- The correct answer is 53°, which corresponds to choice C.
