To solve the problem, we will systematically analyze the given geometric predicates and apply relevant geometric principles.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes and Points:**
- Circle centered at R.
- Points S, T, B, and E exist on the plane.

**Angles and Measurements:**
- Angle(R, S, T) with measure \( x \).
- Angle(S, T, R) with measure \( 2x \).
- Angle(S, R, T) with measure \( 180 - 3x \).

**Objective:**
- Find the value of \( x \).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

**Key Relationships:**
- The angles \( \angle RST \), \( \angle STR \), and \( \angle SRT \) are angles of triangle \( \triangle SRT \).
- The sum of angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \).

Using the given predicates:
\[
\text{Measure of } \angle RST = x
\]
\[
\text{Measure of } \angle STR = 2x
\]
\[
\text{Measure of } \angle SRT = 180 - 3x
\]

The sum of the angles in triangle \( \triangle SRT \) is:
\[
x + 2x + (180 - 3x) = 180
\]

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

**Equation Setup:**
- Combine the angle measures:
  \[
  x + 2x + (180 - 3x) = 180
  \]

**Simplification:**
- Simplify the equation:
  \[
  3x + 180 - 3x = 180
  \]
- This simplifies to:
  \[
  180 = 180
  \]

This equation is always true, indicating that the setup is consistent with the properties of a triangle. However, we need to find \( x \) explicitly.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

**Re-evaluate the angle relationships:**
- From the equation \( x + 2x + (180 - 3x) = 180 \), we see that the terms involving \( x \) cancel out, confirming the angle sum property.

**Determine \( x \):**
- Since the equation simplifies to a tautology, we need to use the individual angle measures to find \( x \).
- Consider the equation for \( \angle SRT \):
  \[
  180 - 3x = \text{Measure of } \angle SRT
  \]
- Since \( \angle SRT \) is part of the triangle, and the sum of angles is \( 180^\circ \), we can set:
  \[
  180 - 3x = 180 - (x + 2x)
  \]
- This confirms the setup, but to find \( x \), consider:
  \[
  3x = 180 - (180 - 3x)
  \]
  \[
  3x = 3x
  \]

**Re-evaluate using specific values:**
- From the angle measures:
  \[
  x + 2x + (180 - 3x) = 180
  \]
- Simplifying gives:
  \[
  180 = 180
  \]

To find \( x \), consider:
- \( \angle SRT = 180 - 3x \) must be a valid angle measure.
- Since \( \angle SRT \) is the largest angle, \( 180 - 3x \) must be less than \( 180 \) and greater than \( 0 \).

**Solve for \( x \):**
- Set \( 180 - 3x > 0 \):
  \[
  180 > 3x
  \]
  \[
  x < 60
  \]

- Check possible values from the answer choices:
  - If \( x = 30 \), then:
    \[
    \angle RST = 30, \quad \angle STR = 60, \quad \angle SRT = 90
    \]
    - Sum: \( 30 + 60 + 90 = 180 \), which is valid.

Thus, \( x = 30 \) satisfies all conditions.

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- Verify: \( x = 30 \) satisfies all angle measures and the triangle angle sum property.
- Compare with answer choices: \( x = 30 \) matches choice A.
