PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we'll follow the structured approach outlined in the task.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shape:**
- We have a rhombus \( FGHJ \).
- Diagonals of a rhombus intersect at point \( K \).

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- \( GH = x + 9 \)
- \( JH = 5x - 2 \)

**Relationships:**
- In a rhombus, all sides are equal: \( FG = GH = HJ = JF \).

**Specific Value to Find:**
- We need to find the value of \( x \).

**Special Geometric Constructions:**
- Diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- Since \( FGHJ \) is a rhombus, all sides are equal: \( GH = HJ \).
- Therefore, we can set up the equation: 
  \[
  x + 9 = 5x - 2
  \]

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- Solve the equation \( x + 9 = 5x - 2 \) to find \( x \).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. Start with the equation:
   \[
   x + 9 = 5x - 2
   \]

2. Subtract \( x \) from both sides:
   \[
   9 = 4x - 2
   \]

3. Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   11 = 4x
   \]

4. Divide both sides by 4:
   \[
   x = \frac{11}{4} = 2.75
   \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- Verify the calculation: 
  - If \( x = 2.75 \), then \( GH = 2.75 + 9 = 11.75 \) and \( JH = 5(2.75) - 2 = 13.75 - 2 = 11.75 \).
  - Both \( GH \) and \( JH \) are equal, confirming the solution is correct.

- Compare with answer choices:
  - A. 2.75
  - B. 3
  - C. 5.5
  - D. 9

The calculated value \( x = 2.75 \) matches choice A.
