====================================================================================================
PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to use the given predicates and geometric properties of a rectangle.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

1. **Geometric Shapes:**
   - Rectangle \(ABCD\)
   - Lines \(AC\), \(BD\), and \(AB\)
   - Point \(E\) where \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect

2. **Measurements and Equalities:**
   - \(\angle ABD = 5x + 5\)
   - \(\angle BAC = 2x + 1\)
   - \(\angle BCD = y^2\)
   - \(\angle CDA = 3y + 10\)

3. **Relationships:**
   - \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, so all angles are \(90^\circ\).

4. **Specific Value Needed:**
   - We need to find \(x\).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- Since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) bisect each other at \(E\), and each diagonal divides the rectangle into two congruent right triangles.
- In a rectangle, opposite angles are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary.
- The sum of angles around point \(E\) is \(360^\circ\).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- Use the properties of a rectangle and the given angle measures to set up equations.
- Since \(\angle ABD\) and \(\angle BAC\) are angles formed by the diagonals, use their relationships to solve for \(x\).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Diagonal Properties:**
   - In \(\triangle ABD\), \(\angle ABD + \angle BDA + \angle BAD = 180^\circ\).
   - Since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, \(\angle BAD = 90^\circ\).

2. **Equation Setup:**
   - \(\angle ABD = 5x + 5\)
   - \(\angle BDA = \angle BAC = 2x + 1\) (since diagonals bisect each other and \(\triangle ABD\) and \(\triangle BAC\) are congruent).

3. **Using the Triangle Sum Property:**
   \[
   (5x + 5) + (2x + 1) + 90 = 180
   \]
   \[
   7x + 6 + 90 = 180
   \]
   \[
   7x + 96 = 180
   \]
   \[
   7x = 84
   \]
   \[
   x = 12
   \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- Verify that \(x = 12\) satisfies all conditions:
  - \(\angle ABD = 5(12) + 5 = 65^\circ\)
  - \(\angle BAC = 2(12) + 1 = 25^\circ\)
  - \(\angle ABD + \angle BAC + 90 = 180\), which holds true.

- Check against answer choices:
  - \(x = 12\) corresponds to choice B.

Final Answer: B
