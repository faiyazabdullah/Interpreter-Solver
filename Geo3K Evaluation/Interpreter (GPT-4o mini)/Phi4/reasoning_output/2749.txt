To solve the problem, we will go through each step systematically.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

- **Geometric Shapes:**
  - Points: W, X, Y, Z, P
  - Lines: WX, XY, YZ, ZW, WP, XP, YP, ZP
  - Rectangle: WXYZ

- **Measurements and Equalities:**
  - ZP = 4x - 9
  - PY = 2x + 5

- **Relationships:**
  - IntersectAt(Line(W,Z), Line(X,Y), Line(P,Z), Point(P)): This indicates that lines WZ and XY intersect at point P, and line PZ also passes through this intersection.

- **Value to Find:**
  - We need to find ZX.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- Since WXYZ is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and parallel. Therefore, WZ = XY and WX = YZ.
- The diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other. Thus, WP = PX and YP = PZ.
- Given ZP = 4x - 9 and PY = 2x + 5, and knowing that PZ = PY (since diagonals bisect each other), we have:
  \[
  PZ = PY = 2x + 5
  \]
  \[
  4x - 9 = 2x + 5
  \]

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- Solve the equation \(4x - 9 = 2x + 5\) to find the value of \(x\).
- Use the properties of the rectangle to find ZX.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   4x - 9 = 2x + 5
   \]
   \[
   4x - 2x = 5 + 9
   \]
   \[
   2x = 14
   \]
   \[
   x = 7
   \]

2. **Calculate ZP and PY using \(x = 7\):**
   \[
   ZP = 4x - 9 = 4(7) - 9 = 28 - 9 = 19
   \]
   \[
   PY = 2x + 5 = 2(7) + 5 = 14 + 5 = 19
   \]

3. **Use the properties of the rectangle:**
   - Since PZ = PY and both are 19, and diagonals bisect each other, the full diagonal ZY is twice PZ:
   \[
   ZY = 2 \times 19 = 38
   \]

4. **Find ZX:**
   - Since WXYZ is a rectangle, ZY is the diagonal, and ZY = \(\sqrt{ZX^2 + ZW^2}\).
   - Since ZW = XY and WX = YZ, and diagonals bisect each other, ZW = WX = YZ = XY.
   - Let ZW = WX = a. Then:
     \[
     ZY = \sqrt{ZX^2 + a^2} = 38
     \]
   - Also, since diagonals bisect each other, ZP = PY = 19, and ZP is half of ZY, confirming ZY = 38.
   - Since ZW = WX = a, and ZY = \(\sqrt{ZX^2 + a^2}\), and ZY = 38, we have:
     \[
     ZX = ZY = 38
     \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The calculated value of ZX is 38, which matches one of the answer choices.
