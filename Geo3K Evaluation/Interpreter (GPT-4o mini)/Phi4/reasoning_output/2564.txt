To solve the problem, let's follow the structured approach outlined in the task.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Rectangle: C, D, E, F
- Circles: Centered at A and H
- Lines: Line(C,D), Line(F,E), Line(C,F), Line(H,B), Line(A,E)

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- Length of Line(C,F) = 5
- Length of Line(C,D) = 10

**Relationships:**
- Parallel: Line(C,D) is parallel to Line(F,E)
- Perpendicular: Line(C,F) is perpendicular to Line(D,E)
- Line(A,E) is a radius of Circle(A)
- Line(H,B) is a radius of Circle(H)

**Positioning:**
- Points C, D, E, F form a rectangle
- Lines C,D and F,E are parallel and form opposite sides of the rectangle
- Lines C,F and D,E are perpendicular and form adjacent sides of the rectangle

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

1. **Rectangle Properties:**
   - Opposite sides of a rectangle are equal and parallel.
   - Adjacent sides are perpendicular.

2. **Given Lengths:**
   - Length of Line(C,D) = 10 (one side of the rectangle)
   - Length of Line(C,F) = 5 (adjacent side of the rectangle)

3. **Rectangle Dimensions:**
   - Since Line(C,D) and Line(F,E) are parallel and equal, Length of Line(F,E) = 10.
   - Since Line(C,F) and Line(D,E) are perpendicular and equal, Length of Line(D,E) = 5.

4. **Area of Rectangle:**
   - Area = Length × Width = 10 × 5 = 50

5. **Circle Properties:**
   - Line(A,E) is a radius of Circle(A).
   - Line(H,B) is a radius of Circle(H).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

The problem asks for the area of the shaded region. Given the information, the shaded region is likely the area of the rectangle minus any overlapping areas with the circles. However, no specific overlap or additional details about the circles' positions relative to the rectangle are provided.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Rectangle Area:**
   - Already calculated as 50.

2. **Circle Overlaps:**
   - Without specific information about the circles' positions or radii, we assume no overlap or that the shaded region refers to the rectangle itself.

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The area of the rectangle is 50.
- Given the answer choices, the closest match to 50 is option D.

Thus, the area of the shaded region, assuming it refers to the entire rectangle, is 50.

Final Answer: D
