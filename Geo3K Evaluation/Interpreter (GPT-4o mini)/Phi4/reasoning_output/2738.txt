====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to find the ratio \(\tan L\) in the right triangle \(\triangle LJK\) and express it as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.

### Step 1: Predicate Analysis and Setup

- **Geometric Shapes:**
  - We have a right triangle \(\triangle LJK\).
  
- **Measurements and Equalities:**
  - Right angle at \( \angle LKJ \).
  - \( \text{Length}(LJ) = 13 \).
  - \( \text{Length}(JK) = 5 \).
  - \( \text{Length}(LK) = 12 \).

- **Relationships:**
  - \( LJ \) is the hypotenuse, as given by \( \text{IsHypotenuseOf(Line(L,J),Triangle(L,J,K))} \).

- **Objective:**
  - Find \(\tan L\) which is \(\tan(\angle JLK)\).

### Step 2: Constraint Synthesis

- Since \(\triangle LJK\) is a right triangle with \(LJ\) as the hypotenuse, by the Pythagorean theorem:
  \[
  LJ^2 = LK^2 + JK^2
  \]
  \[
  13^2 = 12^2 + 5^2
  \]
  \[
  169 = 144 + 25
  \]
  \[
  169 = 169
  \]
  This confirms the side lengths are consistent with a right triangle.

### Step 3: Solution Strategy

- In a right triangle, \(\tan\) of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side.
- For \(\angle JLK\), the opposite side is \(JK\) and the adjacent side is \(LK\).

### Step 4: Mathematical Derivation

- Calculate \(\tan L\):
  \[
  \tan L = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{JK}{LK} = \frac{5}{12}
  \]

- Convert \(\frac{5}{12}\) to a decimal:
  \[
  \frac{5}{12} \approx 0.4167
  \]

- Round to the nearest hundredth:
  \[
  0.4167 \approx 0.42
  \]

### Step 5: Verification and Answer Selection

- The calculated value of \(\tan L\) is approximately \(0.42\), which matches choice B.
