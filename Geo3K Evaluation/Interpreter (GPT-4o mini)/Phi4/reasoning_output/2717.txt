PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to determine the measure of \(\angle 11\) given that \(m \angle 3 = 43^\circ\). We will assume that the figure involves lines and angles that could potentially form parallel lines cut by a transversal, which is a common geometric configuration in such problems.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

- **Geometric Shapes and Relationships**: We are dealing with angles, likely formed by intersecting lines. The notation \(\angle 3\) and \(\angle 11\) suggests that these angles are part of a larger geometric configuration, possibly involving parallel lines and a transversal.
- **Measurements and Equalities**: We know \(m \angle 3 = 43^\circ\).
- **Positioning**: The specific positions of \(\angle 3\) and \(\angle 11\) are not given, but they are likely related through geometric properties such as corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, or vertical angles.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- **Key Relationships**: If \(\angle 3\) and \(\angle 11\) are related through parallel lines cut by a transversal, we can use properties of corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, or consecutive interior angles.
- **Theorem Applications**: We will consider the following theorems:
  - **Corresponding Angles Postulate**: If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then each pair of corresponding angles is equal.
  - **Alternate Interior Angles Theorem**: If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then each pair of alternate interior angles is equal.
  - **Consecutive Interior Angles Theorem**: If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then each pair of consecutive interior angles is supplementary (sum to \(180^\circ\)).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- **Determine Relationships**: Assume that \(\angle 3\) and \(\angle 11\) are either corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, or consecutive interior angles.
- **Apply Theorems**: Use the appropriate theorem based on the assumed relationship.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Assume Corresponding Angles**: If \(\angle 3\) and \(\angle 11\) are corresponding angles, then \(m \angle 11 = m \angle 3 = 43^\circ\).

2. **Assume Alternate Interior Angles**: If \(\angle 3\) and \(\angle 11\) are alternate interior angles, then \(m \angle 11 = m \angle 3 = 43^\circ\).

3. **Assume Consecutive Interior Angles**: If \(\angle 3\) and \(\angle 11\) are consecutive interior angles, then \(m \angle 3 + m \angle 11 = 180^\circ\). Thus, \(43^\circ + m \angle 11 = 180^\circ\), leading to \(m \angle 11 = 180^\circ - 43^\circ = 137^\circ\).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- **Verification**: Check which scenario fits the typical geometric configuration:
  - If \(\angle 3\) and \(\angle 11\) are on the same side of the transversal and inside the parallel lines, they are consecutive interior angles.
  - The calculation for consecutive interior angles gives \(m \angle 11 = 137^\circ\).

Thus, the measure of \(\angle 11\) is \(137^\circ\).
