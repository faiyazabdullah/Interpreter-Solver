To solve for \( m \angle RCM \), we need to analyze the given geometric predicates and apply relevant geometric principles. Since the predicates are not explicitly provided, I will outline a general approach to solving such a problem and apply logical reasoning to arrive at the answer.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

1. **Identify Geometric Shapes and Points:**
   - Points: \( R, C, M \)
   - Possible shapes: Triangle \( \triangle RCM \)

2. **Measurements and Equalities:**
   - We are looking for \( m \angle RCM \).

3. **Relationships:**
   - Look for any given relationships such as parallel lines, perpendicular lines, or congruent angles.

4. **Positioning:**
   - Determine if \( C \) is a special point, such as the center of a circle or a vertex of a triangle.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- **Key Relationships:**
  - If \( C \) is the center of a circle and \( R \) and \( M \) are points on the circle, then \( \angle RCM \) could be a central angle.
  - If \( \triangle RCM \) is isosceles or equilateral, use properties of such triangles.
  - Check for any given angle measures or side lengths that can help deduce \( m \angle RCM \).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- **Theorems and Properties:**
  - If \( C \) is the center of a circle, use the central angle theorem.
  - If \( \triangle RCM \) is isosceles, use the property that base angles are equal.
  - If any angle or side lengths are given, use the triangle sum property or trigonometric identities.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

- **Assume \( C \) is the center of a circle:**
  - If \( R \) and \( M \) are on the circle, \( \angle RCM \) is a central angle.
  - Use any given arc measures or other angles to find \( m \angle RCM \).

- **Assume \( \triangle RCM \) is isosceles:**
  - If \( RC = CM \), then \( \angle RCM \) is the vertex angle.
  - Use the triangle sum property: \( \angle RCM + 2 \times \text{base angle} = 180^\circ \).

- **Use given angle measures:**
  - If any angles or arcs are given, substitute them into the relevant formulas.

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- **Verification:**
  - Ensure the calculated angle makes sense within the context of the problem.
  - Check if the angle fits the constraints of the geometric configuration.

- **Answer Selection:**
  - Compare the calculated angle with the answer choices: 27, 43, 47, 67.

Given the typical nature of such problems, let's assume \( \angle RCM \) is calculated using a common geometric setup, such as a central angle or an isosceles triangle configuration.

If we assume a typical scenario where \( \angle RCM \) is calculated as a central angle or using properties of an isosceles triangle, and given the answer choices, the most plausible answer based on common geometric problems is:
