To solve the problem, we'll follow the structured approach outlined:

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Points: A, B, C
- Circle with center at A
- Line segment B, C

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- Diameter of Circle A is Line BC, with a length of 6.2

**Relationships:**
- Line BC is a diameter of Circle A

**Question:**
- Find the area of the circle with center A.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- Since Line BC is a diameter of Circle A, the length of the diameter is given as 6.2.
- The radius \( r \) of Circle A is half the diameter: \( r = \frac{6.2}{2} = 3.1 \).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- To find the area of Circle A, use the formula for the area of a circle: 
  \[
  \text{Area} = \pi r^2
  \]
- Substitute the radius \( r = 3.1 \) into the formula.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. Calculate the area using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \pi \times (3.1)^2
   \]

2. Calculate \( (3.1)^2 \):
   \[
   (3.1)^2 = 9.61
   \]

3. Multiply by \( \pi \) (use \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \) for calculation):
   \[
   \text{Area} \approx 3.1416 \times 9.61 \approx 30.178176
   \]

4. Round the result to the nearest tenth:
   \[
   \text{Area} \approx 30.2
   \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The calculated area of the circle is approximately 30.2.
- Compare this with the answer choices:
  - A. 19.5
  - B. 30.2
  - C. 60.4
  - D. 120.8

The closest match is choice B.
