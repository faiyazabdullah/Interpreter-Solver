Let's work through the given problem systematically using the structured approach outlined.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

- **Geometric Shapes:** We have a triangle \( \triangle MLP \).
- **Measurements and Equalities:**
  - \( \triangle MLP \) is isosceles.
  - Angles \( \angle MLP \) and \( \angle LPM \) are each 60 degrees.
  - Side lengths are given as \( ML = 2y + 6 \), \( LP = 5x - 3 \), and \( PM = 4 \).
- **Relationships:** The angles suggest that \( \triangle MLP \) is equilateral (since the sum of angles in any triangle is 180 degrees, and two angles are 60 degrees each, the third must also be 60 degrees).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- Since \( \triangle MLP \) is equilateral (all angles are 60 degrees), all sides must be equal:
  - \( ML = LP = PM \).
- Substitute the known length \( PM = 4 \) into the equations for the other sides:
  - \( 2y + 6 = 4 \)
  - \( 5x - 3 = 4 \)

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- Solve the equations to find \( y \) and \( x \).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Solve for \( y \):**
   \[
   2y + 6 = 4
   \]
   \[
   2y = 4 - 6
   \]
   \[
   2y = -2
   \]
   \[
   y = -1
   \]

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   5x - 3 = 4
   \]
   \[
   5x = 4 + 3
   \]
   \[
   5x = 7
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{7}{5} = 1.4
   \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- We found \( x = 1.4 \). This matches one of the provided answer choices.
- Verify: Since \( LP = 5x - 3 = 4 \), substituting \( x = 1.4 \) gives:
  \[
  5(1.4) - 3 = 7 - 3 = 4
  \]
  This confirms the calculation is correct.

Thus, the correct answer is:
