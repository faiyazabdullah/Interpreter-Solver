To solve this geometric problem, we'll follow the structured approach outlined:

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes and Relationships:**
- We have two triangles: Triangle(X, N, Z) and Triangle(M, N, Y).
- Right angles are at M and N: RightAngle(Angle(M, X, N)) and RightAngle(Angle(N, Z, Y)).
- Points lie on lines: M on Line(X, Y), N on Line(X, Z), and N on Line(Y, Z).

**Measurements:**
- X M = 4
- X N = 6
- N Z = 9

**Question:**
- Find X Y.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

**Key Relationships:**
- Triangle(X, N, Z) and Triangle(M, N, Y) both share point N.
- Right angles suggest the presence of right triangles:
  - Triangle(X, M, N) is a right triangle with right angle at M.
  - Triangle(N, Z, Y) is a right triangle with right angle at N.

**Theorems to Apply:**
- Pythagorean Theorem for right triangles.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

**Plan:**
1. Use the Pythagorean Theorem on Triangle(X, M, N) to find X M.
2. Use the Pythagorean Theorem on Triangle(N, Z, Y) to find Y N.
3. Use the Pythagorean Theorem on Triangle(X, N, Y) to find X Y.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

**Step 1: Find M N using Triangle(X, M, N):**
- Triangle(X, M, N) is a right triangle with right angle at M.
- \( X M = 4 \), \( X N = 6 \).
- By the Pythagorean Theorem:
  \[
  X N^2 = X M^2 + M N^2
  \]
  \[
  6^2 = 4^2 + M N^2
  \]
  \[
  36 = 16 + M N^2
  \]
  \[
  M N^2 = 20
  \]
  \[
  M N = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5}
  \]

**Step 2: Find Y N using Triangle(N, Z, Y):**
- Triangle(N, Z, Y) is a right triangle with right angle at N.
- \( N Z = 9 \).
- By the Pythagorean Theorem:
  \[
  N Z^2 = N Y^2 + Y Z^2
  \]
  Since \( Y Z \) is not directly given, we need to find \( Y N \) using the fact that \( M \) lies on line \( X Y \) and \( N \) is common:
  \[
  N Y^2 = N Z^2 - Y Z^2
  \]
  However, we need another approach since \( Y Z \) is not given.

**Step 3: Find X Y using Triangle(X, N, Y):**
- Triangle(X, N, Y) is a right triangle with right angle at N.
- \( X N = 6 \), \( M N = 2\sqrt{5} \), and \( M \) lies on line \( X Y \).
- Since \( M \) is on \( X Y \), \( X Y = X M + M Y \).
- Use Pythagorean Theorem on Triangle(X, N, Y):
  \[
  X Y^2 = X N^2 + N Y^2
  \]
  We need \( N Y \) from the previous step:
  - From \( M N = 2\sqrt{5} \), and knowing \( M \) is on \( X Y \), \( M Y = X Y - X M \).
  - Use \( M N = 2\sqrt{5} \) and \( M Y = X Y - 4 \).
  - Since \( N Y = M N \) (as \( M \) is on \( X Y \)), \( N Y = 2\sqrt{5} \).

- Substitute \( N Y = 2\sqrt{5} \) into the equation:
  \[
  X Y^2 = 6^2 + (2\sqrt{5})^2
  \]
  \[
  X Y^2 = 36 + 20
  \]
  \[
  X Y^2 = 56
  \]
  \[
  X Y = \sqrt{56} = \sqrt{4 \times 14} = 2\sqrt{14}
  \]

**Approximate \( 2\sqrt{14} \):**
- \( \sqrt{14} \approx 3.74 \)
- \( 2\sqrt{14} \approx 2 \times 3.74 = 7.48 \)

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The closest answer choice to \( 7.48 \) is 10.
- Verify: \( 7.48 \) is closer to 10 than any other choice.
