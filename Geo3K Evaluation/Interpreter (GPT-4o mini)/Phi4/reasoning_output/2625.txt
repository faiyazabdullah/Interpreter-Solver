Let's solve the problem step-by-step using the structured approach provided.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

- **Geometric Shapes**: We are dealing with a rectangle \( DEFG \).
- **Measurements and Equalities**:
  - \( m \angle EFD = 2x - 3 \)
  - \( m \angle DFG = x + 12 \)
- **Relationships**: In a rectangle, all interior angles are right angles (90 degrees).

**Question**: Find \( m \angle EFD \).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- Since \( DEFG \) is a rectangle, \( \angle EFD \) and \( \angle DFG \) are angles around point \( F \).
- The sum of angles around a point is 360 degrees.
- However, since \( DEFG \) is a rectangle, \( \angle EFD \) and \( \angle DFG \) are adjacent angles that form a straight line with \( \angle DFE \) and \( \angle EFG \), which are right angles.

Thus, the sum of \( \angle EFD \) and \( \angle DFG \) must be 90 degrees because they are complementary to the right angle at \( \angle DFE \).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- Use the relationship \( m \angle EFD + m \angle DFG = 90 \) to set up an equation.
- Substitute the given expressions for the angles:
  \[
  (2x - 3) + (x + 12) = 90
  \]

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

- Simplify the equation:
  \[
  2x - 3 + x + 12 = 90
  \]
  \[
  3x + 9 = 90
  \]
- Solve for \( x \):
  \[
  3x = 90 - 9
  \]
  \[
  3x = 81
  \]
  \[
  x = 27
  \]

- Substitute \( x = 27 \) back into the expression for \( m \angle EFD \):
  \[
  m \angle EFD = 2x - 3 = 2(27) - 3 = 54 - 3 = 51
  \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- Verify that the calculated angles satisfy the conditions:
  - \( m \angle DFG = x + 12 = 27 + 12 = 39 \)
  - Check: \( m \angle EFD + m \angle DFG = 51 + 39 = 90 \), which is correct.

- Compare with the answer choices:
  - A. 51
  - B. 55
  - C. 67
  - D. 102

The calculated \( m \angle EFD \) is 51, which matches choice A.
