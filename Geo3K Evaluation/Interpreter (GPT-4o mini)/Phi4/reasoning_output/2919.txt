To solve this geometric problem, we need to determine the lengths of the diagonals of a rhombus given specific conditions.

**Step 1: Predicate Analysis and Setup**

- **Geometric Shape**: We are dealing with a rhombus.
- **Measurements**: We know the area of the rhombus is 169 square millimeters.
- **Relationships**: One diagonal is twice as long as the other.
- **Task**: Find the lengths of the diagonals.

**Key Information**:
- The area \( A \) of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula:
  \[
  A = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2
  \]
  where \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \) are the lengths of the diagonals.

- Given: \( d_1 = 2 \times d_2 \).

**Step 2: Constraint Synthesis**

- Substitute the relationship \( d_1 = 2d_2 \) into the area formula:
  \[
  169 = \frac{1}{2} \times (2d_2) \times d_2
  \]
  Simplifying, we have:
  \[
  169 = \frac{1}{2} \times 2d_2^2 = d_2^2
  \]

**Step 3: Solution Strategy**

- Solve for \( d_2 \) from the equation \( d_2^2 = 169 \).

**Step 4: Mathematical Derivation**

- Taking the square root of both sides:
  \[
  d_2 = \sqrt{169} = 13
  \]

- Since \( d_1 = 2d_2 \), calculate \( d_1 \):
  \[
  d_1 = 2 \times 13 = 26
  \]

**Step 5: Verification and Answer Selection**

- Verify:
  - Check the area with these diagonal lengths:
    \[
    A = \frac{1}{2} \times 26 \times 13 = \frac{1}{2} \times 338 = 169 \text{ square millimeters}
    \]
  - The calculations confirm the area is correct.

- Compare with answer choices:
  - \( d_2 = 13 \) corresponds to choice B.
  - \( d_1 = 26 \) corresponds to choice C.

Since the question asks for the lengths of the diagonals, and both \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \) are relevant, the correct answer based on the given choices is the length of the longer diagonal, which is 26.

Final Answer: C
