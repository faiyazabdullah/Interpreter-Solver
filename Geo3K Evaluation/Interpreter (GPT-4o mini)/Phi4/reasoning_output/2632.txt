To solve the problem, we need to determine the length of the median \( EH \) in triangle \( \triangle DEF \) given that triangles \( \triangle ABC \) and \( \triangle DEF \) are similar, and the lengths of specific segments are provided.

### Step 1: Predicate Analysis and Setup

- **Geometric Shapes:**
  - Points: \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H \)
  - Lines: \( AB, AC, BC, DE, DF, EF, BG, EH, DH \)
  - Triangles: \( \triangle ABC \), \( \triangle DEF \)

- **Measurements and Equalities:**
  - \( BC = 30 \)
  - \( BG = 15 \) (median of \( \triangle ABC \))
  - \( EF = 15 \)

- **Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF \)
  - \( BG \) is a median of \( \triangle ABC \)
  - \( EH \) is a median of \( \triangle DEF \)

- **Objective:**
  - Find the length of \( EH \).

### Step 2: Constraint Synthesis

- **Similarity of Triangles:**
  - Since \( \triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF \), corresponding sides are proportional:
    \[
    \frac{AB}{DE} = \frac{BC}{EF} = \frac{AC}{DF}
    \]

- **Median Properties:**
  - In any triangle, the median divides the opposite side into two equal segments.
  - For \( \triangle ABC \), \( BG \) is a median, so \( G \) is the midpoint of \( AC \).
  - For \( \triangle DEF \), \( EH \) is a median, so \( H \) is the midpoint of \( DF \).

### Step 3: Solution Strategy

- **Use the Proportionality from Similar Triangles:**
  - Since \( \triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF \), the ratio of corresponding sides is constant:
    \[
    \frac{BC}{EF} = \frac{30}{15} = 2
    \]
  - This implies that every corresponding linear dimension in \( \triangle ABC \) is twice that in \( \triangle DEF \).

- **Apply the Median Proportionality:**
  - The medians of similar triangles are also proportional to the corresponding sides.
  - Therefore, the ratio of the medians \( BG \) to \( EH \) is the same as the ratio of the sides:
    \[
    \frac{BG}{EH} = \frac{BC}{EF} = 2
    \]

### Step 4: Mathematical Derivation

- **Calculate \( EH \):**
  - Given \( BG = 15 \) and the ratio \( \frac{BG}{EH} = 2 \), we can set up the equation:
    \[
    \frac{15}{EH} = 2
    \]
  - Solving for \( EH \):
    \[
    EH = \frac{15}{2} = 7.5
    \]

### Step 5: Verification and Answer Selection

- **Verification:**
  - The calculation aligns with the properties of similar triangles and the proportionality of medians.
  - The value \( EH = 7.5 \) is consistent with the given data and the similarity ratio.

- **Answer Selection:**
  - The calculated length of \( EH \) is 7.5, which corresponds to choice A.
