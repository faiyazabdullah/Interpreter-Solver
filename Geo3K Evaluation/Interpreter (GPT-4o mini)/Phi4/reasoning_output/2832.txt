PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to determine the measure of \(\angle 3\). Let's break down the given predicates and systematically apply geometric reasoning.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

1. **Geometric Shapes:**
   - Triangle \(ABC\)
   - Triangle \(BCD\)

2. **Measurements and Equalities:**
   - \( \text{MeasureOf}(\angle ABC) = 72^\circ \)
   - \( \text{MeasureOf}(\angle BDC) = 38^\circ \)
   - \( \text{MeasureOf}(\angle ACB) = 42^\circ \)

3. **Identify \(\angle 3\):**
   - We need to find \(m \angle 3\). Since \(\angle 3\) is not directly mentioned, we assume it refers to \(\angle BCA\) in triangle \(BCD\).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- **Triangle \(ABC\):**
  - The sum of angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\).
  - \(\angle BAC = 180^\circ - \angle ABC - \angle ACB = 180^\circ - 72^\circ - 42^\circ = 66^\circ\).

- **Triangle \(BCD\):**
  - We know \(\angle BDC = 38^\circ\).
  - We need to find \(\angle BCD\) (which we assume is \(\angle 3\)).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- Use the triangle angle sum property in \(\triangle BCD\):
  \[
  \angle BCD + \angle CBD + \angle BDC = 180^\circ
  \]

- We need to find \(\angle CBD\). Since \(\angle ABC = 72^\circ\) and \(\angle ACB = 42^\circ\), \(\angle CBD\) is the external angle to \(\triangle ABC\) at vertex \(C\).

- \(\angle CBD = \angle BAC = 66^\circ\) (since \(\angle BAC\) is opposite to \(\angle CBD\) in \(\triangle ABC\)).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

- Substitute known values into the equation for \(\triangle BCD\):
  \[
  \angle BCD + 66^\circ + 38^\circ = 180^\circ
  \]

- Solve for \(\angle BCD\):
  \[
  \angle BCD = 180^\circ - 66^\circ - 38^\circ = 76^\circ
  \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- Verify the calculation:
  - \(\angle BCD = 76^\circ\) is consistent with the angle sum property of triangle \(BCD\).

- Compare with answer choices:
  - A. 38
  - B. 60
  - C. 66
  - D. 72

- The calculated \(\angle BCD = 76^\circ\) does not match any of the given choices directly. However, since the problem might have a typo or misinterpretation, the closest reasonable option based on typical geometric problems would be to check if any assumptions were incorrect or if \(\angle 3\) was misinterpreted.

- Re-evaluate assumptions: If \(\angle 3\) was meant to be \(\angle BDC\), then it would be \(38^\circ\).
