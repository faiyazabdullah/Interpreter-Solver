To solve this problem, we need to apply our understanding of circle geometry, specifically the properties of angles and arcs.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Points: A, B, C, D
- Circle: Centered at A

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- Angle: ∠DBC
- Measure of Arc: Arc(DC) = 218°

**Relationships:**
- Points B, C, D lie on Circle A
- Angle DBC is formed by these points on the circle

**Specific Value to Find:**
- Measure of ∠1, which is ∠DBC

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- Since B, C, and D lie on the circle centered at A, ∠DBC is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc DC.
- The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- Use the Inscribed Angle Theorem, which states that an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Identify Intercepted Arc:**
   - ∠DBC intercepts arc DC.
   - Given: Measure of Arc(DC) = 218°

2. **Apply Inscribed Angle Theorem:**
   - Measure of ∠DBC = 1/2 × Measure of Arc(DC)
   - Measure of ∠DBC = 1/2 × 218°
   - Measure of ∠DBC = 109°

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The calculated measure of ∠DBC is 109°.
- Compare with the answer choices:
  - A. 54.5
  - B. 90
  - C. 109
  - D. 218

The correct answer is 109°, which corresponds to choice C.

Final Answer: C
