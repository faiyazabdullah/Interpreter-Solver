To solve the problem, we will follow the structured approach outlined in the task.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Triangle \( \triangle ABC \)
- Right angle at \( A \) (i.e., \( \angle BCA \) is a right angle)

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- \( \angle CBA = 60^\circ \)
- Length of \( AC = 20 \)

**Relationships:**
- \( AC \) is the hypotenuse of \( \triangle ABC \) because it is opposite the right angle at \( A \).

**Objective:**
- Find \( y \), which is likely a side length of the triangle.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

Given:
- \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle BCA = 90^\circ \).
- \( \angle CBA = 60^\circ \).
- \( \angle BAC = 30^\circ \) (since the angles in a triangle sum to \( 180^\circ \)).
- \( AC = 20 \) is the hypotenuse.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio \( 1 : \sqrt{3} : 2 \). Here:
- The side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle (\( AB \)) is half the hypotenuse.
- The side opposite the \( 60^\circ \) angle (\( BC \)) is \( \sqrt{3} \) times the side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Find \( AB \):**
   \[
   AB = \frac{1}{2} \times AC = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
   \]

2. **Find \( BC \):**
   \[
   BC = AB \times \sqrt{3} = 10 \times \sqrt{3} = 10\sqrt{3}
   \]

Since \( y \) is likely one of the sides of the triangle, and given the choices, we need to approximate \( 10\sqrt{3} \).

3. **Approximate \( 10\sqrt{3} \):**
   \[
   \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732
   \]
   \[
   10\sqrt{3} \approx 10 \times 1.732 = 17.32
   \]

Given the answer choices, \( y \) is not directly \( 17.32 \), but since \( y \) is likely the length of \( BC \), we need to check if any of the choices match a reasonable approximation or simplification.

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

The calculated \( BC \approx 17.32 \) does not match any of the answer choices directly. However, considering the context and typical multiple-choice setups, the problem might be asking for a simpler form or a related value.

Given the choices:
- A. 4
- B. 6
- C. 8
- D. 10

The closest reasonable option considering typical simplifications or misinterpretations in such problems is \( D. 10 \), which corresponds to \( AB \), the side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle.

Thus, the answer is:
