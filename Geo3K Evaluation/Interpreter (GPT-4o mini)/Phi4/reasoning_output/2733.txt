Let's solve the problem step by step following the structured approach outlined.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- We have a square \(ABCD\).

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- The diagonal \(AC\) has a length of 12.
- The angle \(\angle ABD\) is a right angle.
- We need to find the length of the side \(AB\), denoted as \(y\).

**Relationships:**
- \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), and \(DA\) are sides of the square.
- \(AC\) is a diagonal of the square.

**Special Constructions/Geometric Theorems:**
- In a square, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other at right angles.
- Each diagonal divides the square into two congruent right triangles.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

**Key Relationships:**
- In a square, if each side has length \(s\), then the diagonal \(d\) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem in one of the right triangles formed by the diagonal:
  \[
  d = \sqrt{s^2 + s^2} = \sqrt{2s^2} = s\sqrt{2}
  \]
- Given \(AC = 12\), we can set up the equation:
  \[
  s\sqrt{2} = 12
  \]

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

**Solution Path:**
- Solve for \(s\) using the equation derived from the diagonal.
- Use the relationship \(s\sqrt{2} = 12\) to find \(s\), which represents the side length \(y\).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

**Calculation:**
- From the equation \(s\sqrt{2} = 12\), solve for \(s\):
  \[
  s = \frac{12}{\sqrt{2}}
  \]
- Simplify the expression:
  \[
  s = \frac{12}{\sqrt{2}} \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{12\sqrt{2}}{2} = 6\sqrt{2}
  \]
- Therefore, the length of side \(AB\) is \(y = 6\sqrt{2}\).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

**Verification:**
- The calculated side length \(y = 6\sqrt{2}\) is consistent with the properties of a square and the given diagonal length.

**Answer Selection:**
- Compare \(6\sqrt{2}\) with the provided answer choices:
  - A. \(6\sqrt{2}\)
  - B. \(12\sqrt{2}\)
  - C. \(12\sqrt{3}\)
  - D. 24

The correct choice is A.
