====================================================================================================
PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we will systematically analyze the given predicates and apply relevant geometric principles.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Circle(G) with radius 26.
- Points A, B, C, D, E, F, and lines as described.

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- Radius of \(\odot G\) is 26.
- Chords \(AC\) and \(DF\) are equidistant from the center.

**Relationships:**
- Lines \(AE\) and \(ED\) suggest \(E\) is a point on line \(AD\).
- Arc \(ABC\) indicates \(B\) is between \(A\) and \(C\) on the circle.

**Specific Value:**
- We need to find the length of chord \(AC\).

**Special Geometric Constructions:**
- Chords equidistant from the center have equal lengths.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

**Key Relationships:**
- Since chords \(AC\) and \(DF\) are equidistant from the center, they are congruent.
- The distance from the center to a chord is the perpendicular distance from the center to the chord.

**Circle Properties:**
- The perpendicular from the center to a chord bisects the chord.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

**Solution Path:**
1. Use the property that chords equidistant from the center are equal.
2. Use the formula for the length of a chord given the radius and the perpendicular distance from the center.

**Theorems and Formulas:**
- If \(d\) is the perpendicular distance from the center to the chord, and \(r\) is the radius, the length of the chord \(l\) is given by:
  \[
  l = 2 \sqrt{r^2 - d^2}
  \]

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. Let \(d\) be the perpendicular distance from the center \(G\) to chords \(AC\) and \(DF\).
2. Since \(AC = DF\), we can use the formula for the length of a chord:
   \[
   AC = 2 \sqrt{26^2 - d^2}
   \]
3. We need to find \(d\) such that \(AC\) matches one of the answer choices.

4. Assume \(AC = 2 \sqrt{26^2 - d^2}\) and solve for possible values:
   - Try \(AC = 10\):
     \[
     10 = 2 \sqrt{676 - d^2}
     \]
     \[
     5 = \sqrt{676 - d^2}
     \]
     \[
     25 = 676 - d^2
     \]
     \[
     d^2 = 651
     \]
     This is valid since \(d^2 < 676\).

5. Check other values:
   - \(AC = 5\):
     \[
     5 = 2 \sqrt{676 - d^2}
     \]
     \[
     2.5 = \sqrt{676 - d^2}
     \]
     \[
     6.25 = 676 - d^2
     \]
     \[
     d^2 = 669.75
     \]
     This is valid but results in a smaller chord than expected.

   - \(AC = 13\):
     \[
     13 = 2 \sqrt{676 - d^2}
     \]
     \[
     6.5 = \sqrt{676 - d^2}
     \]
     \[
     42.25 = 676 - d^2
     \]
     \[
     d^2 = 633.75
     \]
     This is valid.

   - \(AC = 48\):
     \[
     48 = 2 \sqrt{676 - d^2}
     \]
     \[
     24 = \sqrt{676 - d^2}
     \]
     \[
     576 = 676 - d^2
     \]
     \[
     d^2 = 100
     \]
     This is valid but results in a larger chord than expected for typical circle configurations.

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The calculations show that \(AC = 10\) is a valid solution with \(d^2 = 651\), which is a reasonable distance for a chord in a circle of radius 26.
- The other values either result in smaller or larger chords than expected for typical circle configurations.

Thus, the length of \(AC\) is \(10\).
