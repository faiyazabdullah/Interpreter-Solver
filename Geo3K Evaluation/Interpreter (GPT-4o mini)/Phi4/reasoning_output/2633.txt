====================================================================================================
To solve this geometric problem, we need to carefully analyze the given predicates and apply relevant geometric theorems and properties.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

1. **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
   - Points: F, G, H, J, A, B
   - Circle with center A
   - Lines: F-G, F-H, G-H, F-J, H-J

2. **Measurements and Equalities:**
   - Right angle: ∠FHB is a right angle.
   - IsDiameterOf(Line(F,J), Circle(A)): Line FJ is the diameter of Circle A.
   - IsRadiusOf(Line(A,G), Circle(A)): AG is a radius of Circle A.
   - IsRadiusOf(Line(A,H), Circle(A)): AH is a radius of Circle A.

3. **Relationships:**
   - Line FJ is the diameter, meaning ∠FJB = 90° (Thales' theorem).
   - Since ∠FHB is a right angle, point B lies on the circle with diameter FJ.

4. **Positioning:**
   - Points G and H are on the circle since AG and AH are radii.

5. **Question:**
   - We need to find m∠3 given m∠2 = 2x and m∠3 = x.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- **Key Relationships:**
  - Since FJ is the diameter, any angle subtended by FJ on the circle is a right angle (Thales' theorem).
  - ∠FHB = 90°, indicating that B lies on the circle with diameter FJ.
  - Since AG and AH are radii, G and H lie on the circle.

- **Inscribed Angle Theorem:**
  - ∠FGB and ∠FHB are inscribed angles subtending the same arc FB, thus they are equal.
  - Since ∠FHB = 90°, ∠FGB = 90°.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- **Identify Angles:**
  - Let ∠FGB = ∠2 and ∠HGB = ∠3.
  - Since ∠FGB = 90° and m∠2 = 2x, we have 2x = 90°.
  - Therefore, x = 45°.

- **Find m∠3:**
  - m∠3 = x = 45°.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

- From the inscribed angle theorem and given that ∠FHB = 90°, we know:
  - m∠2 = 2x = 90°
  - Solving for x gives x = 45°.

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The calculated value of m∠3 is 45°, which matches answer choice B.

Final Answer: B
