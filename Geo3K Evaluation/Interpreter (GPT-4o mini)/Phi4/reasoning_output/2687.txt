### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Circles: \(\odot A\), \(\odot B\), \(\odot C\)
- Points: \(E, A, X, Z, B, Y, C, W, D\)
- Line: \(E, D\)

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- Diameters: \(\odot A = 10\), \(\odot B = 30\), \(\odot C = 10\)
- Tangent lengths: \(AZ \cong CW\) and \(CW = 2\)

**Relationships and Positioning:**
- Points \(E, A, B, C, D\) lie on line \(E, D\)
- Points \(E, A\) lie on \(\odot A\)
- Points \(B\) lie on \(\odot B\)
- Points \(C, D\) lie on \(\odot C\)
- \(Line(E, Z)\) is tangent to \(\odot A\)
- \(Line(W, D)\) is tangent to \(\odot C\)
- Intersections: \(\odot A\) and \(\odot B\) at \(X\), \(\odot B\) and \(\odot C\) at \(Y\)

**Goal:** Find \(AC\) given \(AZ \cong CW\) and \(CW = 2\).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

1. **Circle Radii:**
   - Radius of \(\odot A = \frac{10}{2} = 5\)
   - Radius of \(\odot B = \frac{30}{2} = 15\)
   - Radius of \(\odot C = \frac{10}{2} = 5\)

2. **Tangents:**
   - \(AZ\) is tangent to \(\odot A\) at \(A\), so \(EZ\) is perpendicular to \(AZ\).
   - \(CW\) is tangent to \(\odot C\) at \(C\), so \(CW\) is perpendicular to the radius \(CD\).

3. **Intersections:**
   - \(X\) is the intersection of \(\odot A\) and \(\odot B\).
   - \(Y\) is the intersection of \(\odot B\) and \(\odot C\).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- Use the fact that \(AZ \cong CW = 2\).
- Since \(AZ\) and \(CW\) are tangents from points \(E\) and \(W\) respectively, and both are equal, we can use the Power of a Point theorem or similar triangles to find relationships between the segments.
- Since \(A, B, C, D\) lie on line \(E, D\), we can use the collinearity to find distances.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. **Power of a Point:**
   - For point \(E\) with respect to \(\odot A\), \(EA^2 = EZ^2 = EA \cdot EX\).
   - For point \(W\) with respect to \(\odot C\), \(WC^2 = WD^2 = WC \cdot WY\).

2. **Using Tangent Lengths:**
   - \(AZ = CW = 2\).

3. **Using Circle Properties:**
   - Since \(A\) and \(C\) are on the same line \(E, D\) and \(AZ = CW\), the symmetry and equal tangents imply that \(A\) and \(C\) are equidistant from the center of \(\odot B\) along line \(E, D\).

4. **Calculate \(AC\):**
   - Since \(A\) and \(C\) are on the line \(E, D\) and the tangents \(AZ\) and \(CW\) are equal, the distance \(AC\) is the difference in their positions along the line.
   - The centers of \(\odot A\) and \(\odot C\) are \(5\) units from \(A\) and \(C\) respectively.
   - The total distance from \(A\) to \(C\) along line \(E, D\) is the sum of the radii of \(\odot A\) and \(\odot C\) plus the distance between the centers of \(\odot A\) and \(\odot C\).

5. **Calculate Using Known Values:**
   - Since \(AZ = CW = 2\), and both are tangents from the same line \(E, D\), the distance \(AC\) is the sum of the radii plus twice the tangent length:
   \[
   AC = 5 + 5 + 2 + 2 = 14
   \]
   - However, this does not match any answer choices, so we must consider the alignment along the line \(E, D\).

6. **Re-evaluate Using Line \(E, D\):**
   - Since \(A\) and \(C\) are on the line \(E, D\) and the tangents are equal, the effective distance \(AC\) is the direct line segment between \(A\) and \(C\) on \(E, D\).
   - The distance from \(A\) to \(C\) is the distance between the centers of \(\odot A\) and \(\odot C\) minus the overlap due to tangents:
   \[
   AC = 15 - 5 - 5 + 2 + 2 = 9
   \]
   - Re-evaluate using the correct alignment:
   - The correct alignment considering the tangents and radii gives:
   \[
   AC = 15 - 5 + 5 - 5 + 2 = 12
   \]
   - Correctly considering the symmetry and tangents:
   \[
   AC = 15 - 5 + 5 - 5 + 2 + 2 = 14
