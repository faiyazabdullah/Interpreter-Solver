To solve the problem, let's go through the step-by-step process:

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

- **Geometric Shape**: Quadrilateral WXYZ is a rectangle.
- **Measurements and Equalities**: \( m \angle 1 = 30^\circ \).
- **Relationships**: In a rectangle, all angles are \(90^\circ\).

We need to find the measure of \(\angle 6\).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- Since WXYZ is a rectangle, all interior angles are \(90^\circ\).
- The angles \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 6\) are part of the rectangle, possibly formed by diagonals or other constructions.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- **Theorem Application**: In a rectangle, diagonals bisect each other and are equal. If \(\angle 1\) is part of a triangle formed by a diagonal, we can use properties of triangles.
- **Triangle Properties**: If \(\angle 1\) is part of a triangle formed by a diagonal, the sum of angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\).

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

1. Assume \(\angle 1\) is part of a triangle formed by a diagonal of the rectangle.
2. In a rectangle, diagonals bisect each other and create two congruent triangles.
3. If \(\angle 1 = 30^\circ\) is part of such a triangle, the other two angles must sum to \(150^\circ\).
4. Since the rectangle's diagonals create two congruent triangles, \(\angle 6\) is likely the angle adjacent to \(\angle 1\) in one of these triangles.
5. In an isosceles triangle formed by the diagonal, the angles opposite the equal sides are equal.
6. Therefore, if \(\angle 1 = 30^\circ\), the other angle in the triangle (adjacent to the right angle) is also \(30^\circ\).
7. Thus, \(\angle 6 = 90^\circ - 30^\circ = 60^\circ\).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- Verify: The calculation aligns with the properties of triangles and rectangles.
- Compare: The calculated measure of \(\angle 6\) is \(60^\circ\).

Thus, the correct answer is:
