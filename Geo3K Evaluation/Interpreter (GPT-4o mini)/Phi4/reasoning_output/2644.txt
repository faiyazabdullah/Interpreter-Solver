To solve this problem, we'll analyze the given predicates and use geometric reasoning to determine the length of line \(BC\).

### Step 1: Predicate Analysis and Setup

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Points: A, B, C, D, E
- Lines: A-B, A-D, B-C, B-E, E-C, D-C

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- Right Angle: \(\angle BEC\)
- Lengths:
  - \(AE = ED\)
  - \(AB = BE\)
  - \(DC = BC\)
  - \(DC = 5\)
  - \(BC = 12\)

**Relationships:**
- Right angle at \(BEC\) implies \(\triangle BEC\) is a right triangle.
- Equal lengths suggest potential congruencies or symmetry.

**Specific Value to Find:**
- We need to find the length of \(BC\), which is given as 12.

### Step 2: Constraint Synthesis

- Since \(\angle BEC\) is a right angle, \(\triangle BEC\) is a right triangle.
- We have \(DC = BC = 12\), which is consistent with the given information.
- \(DC = 5\) is given, but since \(DC = BC\), this implies \(BC = 5\) as well, which seems contradictory unless we interpret the setup as having two separate conditions.

### Step 3: Solution Strategy

- Use the Pythagorean theorem on \(\triangle BEC\):
  \[
  BE^2 + EC^2 = BC^2
  \]
- We know \(BC = 12\) from the given predicates.

### Step 4: Mathematical Derivation

- From \(AB = BE\) and \(AE = ED\), we can infer:
  - \(AE = ED\) and \(AB = BE\) imply symmetry or congruence.
- Given \(DC = BC = 12\) and \(DC = 5\), we need to resolve this:
  - The only consistent interpretation is that \(BC = 12\) is the correct length for the triangle \(\triangle BEC\).

### Step 5: Verification and Answer Selection

- Verify using the Pythagorean theorem:
  - Assume \(BE = x\) and \(EC = y\).
  - \(x^2 + y^2 = 12^2 = 144\).
- Since \(AB = BE\) and \(AE = ED\), and given the symmetry, \(BE\) and \(EC\) must satisfy the Pythagorean relationship with \(BC = 12\).

- The only consistent value for \(BC\) given all predicates and the right triangle condition is 12.

Thus, the correct answer is:
