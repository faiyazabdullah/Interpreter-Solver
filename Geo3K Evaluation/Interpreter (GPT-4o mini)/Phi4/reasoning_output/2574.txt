Let's solve the problem step-by-step.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Shapes:**
- Circle with center K.
- Points G, J, H, and K.
- Lines: Line(G,J) and Line(J,H).

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- Measure of Angle(G,K,J) = 122 degrees.

**Relationships:**
- PointLiesOnCircle(G, Circle(K)), PointLiesOnCircle(J, Circle(K)), PointLiesOnCircle(H, Circle(K)).
- PointLiesOnLine(K, Line(G,J)) and PointLiesOnLine(K, Line(J,H)).
- Angle(G,K,J) and Angle(H,K,J) are given.

**Positioning:**
- GJ is a diameter of circle K.

**Specific Value to Find:**
- Measure of Angle(G,L,J), denoted as m∠GLJ.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- Since GJ is a diameter of circle K, by the Inscribed Angle Theorem, any angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle. Therefore, ∠GKJ = 90 degrees.
- We know that Angle(G,K,J) = 122 degrees. This angle is not the inscribed angle but rather a central angle.
- The inscribed angle ∠GLJ, which subtends the arc GJ, is half of the central angle ∠GKJ because of the Inscribed Angle Theorem.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- Use the Inscribed Angle Theorem: An inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.
- Since GJ is a diameter, the arc GJ is a semicircle, and the inscribed angle ∠GLJ subtending this arc is 90 degrees.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

- The central angle ∠GKJ is 180 degrees because GJ is a diameter.
- Therefore, the inscribed angle ∠GLJ is half of 180 degrees:
  \[
  m∠GLJ = \frac{180}{2} = 90 \text{ degrees}
  \]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- The calculated measure of ∠GLJ is 90 degrees.
- Compare this with the answer choices:
  - A. 90
  - B. 120
  - C. 180
  - D. 360

The correct answer is 90 degrees.
