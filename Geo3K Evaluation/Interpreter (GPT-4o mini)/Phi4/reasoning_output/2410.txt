QUESTION:
Find C D if A C = x - 3, B E = 20, A B = 16, and C D = x + 5.

CHOICES:
A. 32
B. 35
C. 36

====================================================================================================
PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to find the value of \( CD \) given the relationships:

- \( AC = x - 3 \)
- \( BE = 20 \)
- \( AB = 16 \)
- \( CD = x + 5 \)

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

**Geometric Elements:**
- Points: \( A, B, C, D, E \)
- Line segments: \( AC, BE, AB, CD \)

**Measurements and Equalities:**
- \( AC = x - 3 \)
- \( BE = 20 \)
- \( AB = 16 \)
- \( CD = x + 5 \)

**Objective:**
- Find the value of \( CD \).

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

We have the following relationships:
- \( AC = x - 3 \)
- \( CD = x + 5 \)

We need to find a relationship between these segments and the given \( AB = 16 \).

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

Assume that \( A, B, C, D \) are collinear, and \( B \) is between \( A \) and \( C \), and \( C \) is between \( B \) and \( D \). This assumption allows us to use the segment addition postulate:

\[ AB + BC = AC \]
\[ AC + CD = AD \]

Since \( B \) is between \( A \) and \( C \), we can express \( BC \) as:
\[ BC = AC - AB = (x - 3) - 16 = x - 19 \]

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

Using the segment addition postulate for \( AD \):
\[ AD = AB + BC + CD \]

Substitute the known values:
\[ AD = 16 + (x - 19) + (x + 5) \]

Simplify:
\[ AD = 16 + x - 19 + x + 5 \]
\[ AD = 2x + 2 \]

Since \( BE = 20 \) is given but not directly related to \( AD \), we assume \( BE \) is not affecting the collinear segments \( A, B, C, D \).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

To find \( x \), we need more information. However, if \( AD \) is a specific length or if \( BE \) is related to \( AD \) in a way not given, we might need to assume \( AD = BE \) for a specific configuration.

Assume \( AD = BE = 20 \):
\[ 2x + 2 = 20 \]

Solve for \( x \):
\[ 2x = 18 \]
\[ x = 9 \]

Now, substitute \( x = 9 \) back into the expression for \( CD \):
\[ CD = x + 5 = 9 + 5 = 14 \]

Since 14 is not an option, check the setup again. Assume \( AD \) is not directly equal to \( BE \), but \( x \) must satisfy the segment relationships.

Re-evaluate:
\[ 2x + 2 = 36 \] (assuming \( AD = 36 \) based on options)

Solve for \( x \):
\[ 2x = 34 \]
\[ x = 17 \]

Now, substitute \( x = 17 \) back into the expression for \( CD \):
\[ CD = x + 5 = 17 + 5 = 22 \]

Re-evaluate the setup:
Assume \( AD = 36 \) based on options:
\[ 2x + 2 = 36 \]
\[ 2x = 34 \]
\[ x = 17 \]

Substitute \( x = 17 \) into \( CD \):
