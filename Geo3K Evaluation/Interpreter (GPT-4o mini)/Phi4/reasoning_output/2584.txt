QUESTION:
In the figure, m \angle 4 = 101. Find the measure of \angle 6.

CHOICES:
A. 69
B. 79
C. 89
D. 101

====================================================================================================
PHI-4 MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we will analyze the geometric relationships and apply relevant theorems to find the measure of \(\angle 6\).

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

From the problem, we are given:
- \(m \angle 4 = 101^\circ\).

We need to find:
- The measure of \(\angle 6\).

Assumptions based on typical geometric setups:
- \(\angle 4\) and \(\angle 6\) are likely related by some geometric configuration, such as being part of parallel lines cut by a transversal, or being angles in a polygon or circle.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

Let's consider common geometric configurations:
1. **Parallel Lines Cut by a Transversal:**
   - If \(\angle 4\) and \(\angle 6\) are alternate interior angles or corresponding angles, they would be equal if the lines are parallel.
   - If \(\angle 4\) and \(\angle 6\) are consecutive interior angles, they would be supplementary (sum to \(180^\circ\)).

2. **Cyclic Quadrilateral:**
   - If \(\angle 4\) and \(\angle 6\) are opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral, they would be supplementary.

3. **Linear Pair:**
   - If \(\angle 4\) and \(\angle 6\) form a linear pair, they are supplementary.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

Given \(m \angle 4 = 101^\circ\), let's explore the possibilities:

1. **Supplementary Angles:**
   - If \(\angle 4\) and \(\angle 6\) are supplementary, then:
     \[
     m \angle 4 + m \angle 6 = 180^\circ
     \]
     \[
     101^\circ + m \angle 6 = 180^\circ
     \]
     \[
     m \angle 6 = 180^\circ - 101^\circ = 79^\circ
     \]

2. **Other Configurations:**
   - If \(\angle 4\) and \(\angle 6\) were equal (e.g., alternate interior angles), \(m \angle 6\) would also be \(101^\circ\). However, this does not match any of the answer choices except \(D\), which is unlikely given typical geometric setups.
   - If they were part of a cyclic quadrilateral or linear pair, they would still be supplementary, leading to the same calculation.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

Using the supplementary angle relationship:
\[
m \angle 6 = 180^\circ - 101^\circ = 79^\circ
\]

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

The calculated measure of \(\angle 6\) is \(79^\circ\), which matches one of the answer choices.
