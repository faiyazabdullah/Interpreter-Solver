To solve the problem of finding the scale factor from \( Q \) to \( Q' \), we need to systematically analyze the given geometric predicates, though they are not explicitly listed here. Instead, I'll outline a structured approach based on typical geometric problems involving scale factors.

### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP

- **Geometric Shapes**: Identify if \( Q \) and \( Q' \) are geometric figures such as triangles, squares, or circles. The scale factor typically applies to similar figures.
- **Measurements and Equalities**: Look for any given lengths, areas, or perimeters that relate \( Q \) to \( Q' \).
- **Relationships**: Determine if there are any congruence or similarity relationships stated between \( Q \) and \( Q' \).
- **Positioning**: Check if there are any transformations mentioned, such as dilation, which directly relate to scale factors.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS

- **Combine Predicates**: Use the information to form a complete picture. For example, if \( Q \) and \( Q' \) are triangles, and their corresponding sides are in proportion, this indicates similarity.
- **Key Relationships**: Identify if there are any specific relationships, such as corresponding angles being equal or sides being proportional, which are crucial for determining the scale factor.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY

- **Direct Solution Path**: If \( Q \) and \( Q' \) are similar figures, the scale factor can be found by comparing corresponding linear measurements (e.g., side lengths).
- **Theorem Applications**: Use the properties of similar figures, where the ratio of any two corresponding lengths is the scale factor.

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION

- **Execute Strategy**: Suppose \( Q \) and \( Q' \) are triangles with corresponding sides \( a, b, c \) for \( Q \) and \( a', b', c' \) for \( Q' \).
- **Calculate Scale Factor**: The scale factor \( k \) is given by \( k = \frac{a'}{a} = \frac{b'}{b} = \frac{c'}{c} \).
- **Substitute Known Values**: If specific side lengths are given, substitute them to find \( k \).

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND ANSWER SELECTION

- **Verify Result**: Ensure the calculated scale factor is consistent with all given information.
- **Compare with Choices**: Match the calculated scale factor with the provided answer choices: A. 2, B. 3, C. 4, D. 5.

Assuming the problem involves typical geometric figures and transformations, and based on common scenarios:

- If the problem states that the area of \( Q' \) is 4 times that of \( Q \), then the linear scale factor \( k \) would be \( \sqrt{4} = 2 \).
- If the problem states that the perimeter of \( Q' \) is 3 times that of \( Q \), then the scale factor \( k \) would be 3.

Without specific predicates, let's assume a common scenario where the area of \( Q' \) is 4 times that of \( Q \), leading to a scale factor of 2.
