STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2710
================================================================================
QUESTION: Quadrilateral W X Y Z is a rectangle. Find the measure of \angle 5 if m \angle 1 = 30.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rectangle WXYZ with vertices labeled W, X, Y, Z.
- There are diagonals drawn within the rectangle, connecting opposite vertices.
- Angles and segments are labeled with numbers: 1 through 12.
- Right-angle symbols are present at vertices W and Y.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral WXYZ is a rectangle.
- Diagonals WX and YZ intersect at point O.
- Angles 1, 2, 3, and 4 are right angles at vertices X, Y, Z, and W respectively.
- Angles 5 through 12 are interior angles of the rectangle.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- No numerical values are explicitly given for the sides or angles in the diagram.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle 5 given that \( m\angle 1 = 30^\circ \).
- Since WXYZ is a rectangle, all its internal angles are 90 degrees.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the rectangle, right angles, and the relationship between the angles.
