STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2481
================================================================================
QUESTION: \odot P \cong \odot Q. Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows two circles, $\odot P$ and $\odot Q$, each containing a central angle measurement.
- Circle $\odot P$ has a central angle of $155^\circ$.
- Circle $\odot Q$ has a central angle of $205^\circ$.
- Both circles have radii denoted as $3x$ and $7x - 44$ respectively.
- The circles appear to be congruent, meaning they have equal radii.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- $\odot P \cong \odot Q$: This means the radii of both circles are equal.
- Therefore, $3x = 7x - 44$.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The equation to find $x$ is derived from the equality of the radii: $3x = 7x - 44$.
- Solving for $x$ will give us the value we need.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- We need to solve the equation $3x = 7x - 44$ for $x$.
- This requires basic algebraic manipulation to isolate $x$.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the congruence of the circles and the equality of the radii.
- The equation to solve for $x$ will be derived from the relationship between the radii.
