STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2529
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, and C.
- Side AB is marked as 20 units long.
- Side BC is marked as 12 units long.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B.
- The angle at vertex C is labeled as 60 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with the right angle at B.
- Sides AB and BC are perpendicular.
- Side AC is the hypotenuse.
- Angle ABC is 60 degrees, making angle ACB 30 degrees because the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 20 units (given).
- BC = 12 units (given).
- Angle ACB = 60 degrees (given).

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of side BC.
- This requires using the geometric relationships visible in the triangle, specifically the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include the given measurements and the geometric properties of the triangle.
