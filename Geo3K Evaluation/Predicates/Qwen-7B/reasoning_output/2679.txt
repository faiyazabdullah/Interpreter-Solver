STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2679
================================================================================
QUESTION: The diagram shows the layout of Elm, Plum, and Oak streets. Find the value of x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows two intersecting streets named Elm and Plum.
- There are three labeled points: Elm (C), Plum (E), and Oak (A).
- Two lines extend vertically from Elm to B and from Plum to D.
- A line extends from B to D, forming an intersection point G.
- A line extends from G to F, which lies on the intersection of the vertical lines.
- An angle at G is labeled as 55°.
- The question asks for the value of x, which appears to be the angle at F.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The line from B to D is horizontal.
- The line from G to F intersects the horizontal line at a right angle (90°).
- The angle at G is given as 55°, which implies the complementary angle at F is 90° - 55° = 35°.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- No specific lengths are provided, so we focus on the angles.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of x.
- The angle at F is the key to solving this problem.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the streets, the intersection point, and the angle relationships.
