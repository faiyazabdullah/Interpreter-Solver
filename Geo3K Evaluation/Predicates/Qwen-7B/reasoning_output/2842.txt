STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2842
================================================================================
QUESTION: Use parallelogram A B C D to find m \angle D A C.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows a parallelogram \(ABCD\).
- Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are labeled.
- Line segments \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), and \(DA\) form the sides of the parallelogram.
- Angles are labeled as follows:
  - \(\angle A = 59^\circ\)
  - \(\angle D = 59^\circ\)
  - \(\angle B = 20^\circ\)
  - \(\angle C = 49^\circ\)
- Sides \(AB\) and \(CD\) have lengths marked as \(3y - 8\).
- Sides \(BC\) and \(AD\) have lengths marked as \(2x + 7\).
- Side \(CD\) has a length of 10 units.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Parallelogram \(ABCD\) implies:
  - \(AB \parallel CD\)
  - \(BC \parallel DA\)
  - Opposite sides are equal: \(AB = CD\) and \(BC = DA\).
  - Adjacent angles sum up to \(180^\circ\): \(\angle A + \angle D = 180^\circ\), \(\angle B + \angle C = 180^\circ\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Given lengths:
  - \(CD = 10\)
  - \(AB = CD = 10\)
  - \(BC = AD = 2x + 7\)
  - \(AB = 3y - 8\)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find \(m\angle DAC\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the parallelogram, angles, and side lengths.
- Capture the relationship between angles and sides.
