STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2885
================================================================================
QUESTION: If pentagons A B C D E and P Q R S T are similar, find S R.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image contains two pentagons labeled as \(ABCDE\) and \(PQRST\).
- The pentagon \(ABCDE\) has vertices \(A, B, C, D, E\) with side lengths labeled as follows:
  - \(AB = 11\)
  - \(BC = 8\)
  - \(CD = 14\)
  - \(DE = 11\)
  - \(EA = 14\)
- The pentagon \(PQRST\) has vertices \(P, Q, R, S, T\) with no specific side lengths labeled.
- Both pentagons are marked as similar.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since both pentagons are similar, corresponding sides are proportional.
- The ratio of corresponding sides can be used to find the unknown side length \(SR\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Given side lengths of pentagon \(ABCDE\):
  - \(AB = 11\)
  - \(BC = 8\)
  - \(CD = 14\)
  - \(DE = 11\)
  - \(EA = 14\)
- Let the side length \(SR\) be the unknown we need to find.
- Since the pentagons are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides is preserved.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the length of side \(SR\) in pentagon \(PQRST\).
- We need to use the similarity property to find the length of \(SR\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the pentagons, their sides, and the similarity relationship.
- Capture the given side lengths and the unknown side length \(SR\).
