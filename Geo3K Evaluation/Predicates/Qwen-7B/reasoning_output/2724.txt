STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2724
================================================================================
QUESTION: \triangle L M N \cong \triangle Q R S. Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows two triangles, \(\triangle LMN\) and \(\triangle QRS\).
- \(\triangle LMN\) has sides labeled \(LM = 2x + 11\) and \(MN = y + 10^\circ\).
- \(\triangle QRS\) has sides labeled \(QS = 3x - 9\) and \(SR = 2y - 40^\circ\).
- Both triangles appear to be congruent (\(\triangle LMN \cong \triangle QRS\)).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since \(\triangle LMN \cong \triangle QRS\), corresponding sides and angles are equal.
- Corresponding sides are: \(LM = QS\), \(MN = SR\), and \(LN = RS\).
- Corresponding angles are: \(\angle MLN = \angle QSR\), \(\angle LMN = \angle QRS\), and \(\angle MNL = \angle RQS\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Given measurements:
  - \(LM = 2x + 11\)
  - \(MN = y + 10^\circ\) (This seems to be an angle measurement, not a length. It might be a misinterpretation; typically lengths are numeric.)
  - \(QS = 3x - 9\)
  - \(SR = 2y - 40^\circ\) (Similarly, this seems to be an angle measurement, not a length.)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find \(x\).
- Since \(\triangle LMN \cong \triangle QRS\), we need to equate the corresponding sides and solve for \(x\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangles and their corresponding sides and angles.
- Ensure all sides and angles are equated due to congruence.
