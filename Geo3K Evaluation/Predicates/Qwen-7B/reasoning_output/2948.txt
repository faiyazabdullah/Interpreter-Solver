STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2948
================================================================================
QUESTION: In the figure, A D is perpendicular to B C and A B is perpendicular to A C. What is B C?

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABD with vertices labeled A, B, D.
- Side AD is marked as 10 units.
- Side BD is marked as 5 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex A.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex D.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABD is a right triangle with right angle at A and D.
- Sides AD and BD are perpendicular.
- Side AB is the hypotenuse of the right triangle ABD.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = ? (unknown)
- BD = 5 units (given)
- AD = 10 units (given)

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of BC.
- Since the diagram does not show BC directly and no additional information about BC is given, we need to find BC through the relationship of triangles ABD and BCD.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the right triangles, lengths, and relationships.
