STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2951
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the perimeter of the figure.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, and D.
- Side AB is marked as 10 units long.
- Side BC is marked as 8 units long.
- Side CD is marked as 4 units long.
- There are right angle symbols at vertices C and D, indicating that angles BCD and ADC are right angles.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Angles BCD and ADC are right angles, so triangles BCD and ADC are right triangles.
- Triangles BCD and ADC share the side CD, which acts as the common base for both triangles.
- Side AB is not connected to sides BC or CD, forming a larger quadrilateral.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 10 units
- BC = 8 units
- CD = 4 units
- No direct measurement for AD is given, but it is part of triangle ADC.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the perimeter of the figure.
- To find the perimeter, we need the lengths of all four sides of the quadrilateral ABCD.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the quadrilateral, right angles, measurements, and the perimeter calculation.
