STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2421
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the perimeter of the parallelogram. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a parallelogram ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, and D.
- Side AB is marked as 12 cm.
- Side AD is marked as 20 cm.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCD is a parallelogram.
- Angles ∠ABC and ∠ADC are right angles (90°).
- Sides AB and CD are parallel and equal in length.
- Sides AD and BC are parallel and equal in length.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 12 cm.
- AD = 20 cm.
- Since ABCD is a parallelogram, BC = AD = 20 cm.
- Since ABCD is a parallelogram, CD = AB = 12 cm.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the perimeter of the parallelogram.
- To find the perimeter, we need to sum the lengths of all four sides.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, right angles, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
