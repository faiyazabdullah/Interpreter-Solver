STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2963
================================================================================
QUESTION: In the figure, C P is an altitude, C Q is the angle bisector of \angle A C B, and R is the midpoint of A B. Find m \angle A C Q if m \angle A C B = 123 - x and m \angle Q C B = 42 + x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, and C.
- Side AB has a point P marked on it, and sides AC and BC have points Q and R marked on them respectively.
- Line CP is labeled as an altitude, indicating that it is perpendicular to AB.
- Line CQ is labeled as the angle bisector of ∠ACB.
- Point R is labeled as the midpoint of AB.
- Angle ACB is labeled as 123 - x.
- Angle QC B is labeled as 42 + x.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a triangle with vertices A, B, and C.
- CP is an altitude of triangle ABC.
- CQ is the angle bisector of ∠ACB.
- R is the midpoint of AB.
- ∠ACB = 123 - x.
- ∠QC B = 42 + x.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- ∠ACB = 123 - x.
- ∠QC B = 42 + x.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for m∠ACQ, which is the measure of angle ACQ.
- This angle is formed by the intersection of the angle bisector CQ with side AC.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, altitude, angle bisector, midpoint, and the given angles.
