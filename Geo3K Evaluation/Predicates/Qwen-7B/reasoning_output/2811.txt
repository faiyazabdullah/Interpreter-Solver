STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2811
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, and C.
- Side AB is marked as 16 units.
- Side BC is marked as 10 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at vertex B.
- Side AB and side BC are perpendicular to each other.
- Side AC is the hypotenuse.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 16 units (given)
- BC = 10 units (given)
- AC length needs to be found.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of AC.
- This requires using the Pythagorean theorem since triangle ABC is a right triangle.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
