STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2697
================================================================================
QUESTION: If A B \parallel D C, find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a parallelogram \(ABCD\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\).
- Angle \(ADC\) is marked as \(65^\circ\).
- Line segment \(AB\) is parallel to line segment \(DC\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram because \(AB \parallel DC\) and \(AD \parallel BC\).
- The opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal in length (\(AB = DC\) and \(AD = BC\)).
- The consecutive angles of a parallelogram are supplementary, meaning they add up to \(180^\circ\). Therefore, if \(\angle ADC = 65^\circ\), then \(\angle ABC = 180^\circ - 65^\circ = 115^\circ\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(\angle ADC = 65^\circ\).
- Since \(AB \parallel DC\) and \(AD \parallel BC\), the sum of adjacent angles on the same side of a transversal through a point is \(180^\circ\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \(\angle BAD\).
- In a parallelogram, the opposite angles are equal, so \(\angle BAD = \angle BCD\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, angles, and the relationship between them.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
