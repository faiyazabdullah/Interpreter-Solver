STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2787
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \widehat Q T S.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center \( B \).
- Points \( Q \), \( R \), and \( S \) lie on the circle.
- Line segments \( QR \) and \( RS \) form two chords of the circle.
- Angles \( \angle QBS \) and \( \angle RBS \) are given as \( 71^\circ \) and \( 106^\circ \) respectively.
- Point \( T \) lies outside the circle.
- No right angles or parallel lines are indicated.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( B \) is the center of the circle.
- \( Q \), \( R \), and \( S \) are points on the circle.
- \( QR \) and \( RS \) are chords of the circle.
- Angles \( \angle QBS \) and \( \angle RBS \) are inscribed angles subtended by arc \( QS \).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( \angle QBS = 71^\circ \)
- \( \angle RBS = 106^\circ \)

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find \( m\widehat{QTS} \).
- This means we need to determine the measure of arc \( QT \).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, its center, and the given angles.
- Must include the relationship between the central angle and the arc it subtends.
