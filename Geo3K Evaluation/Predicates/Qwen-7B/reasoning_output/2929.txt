STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2929
================================================================================
QUESTION: If \frac { I J } { X J } = \frac { H J } { Y J }, m \angle W X J = 130 and m \angle W Z G = 20, find m \angle J.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure with multiple points, lines, and angles.
- Points labeled as W, X, Y, Z, J, H, G, and C.
- Lines WX, XY, YZ, and CJ are marked.
- Angles W X J is labeled as 130 degrees.
- Angle W Z G is labeled as 20 degrees.
- The ratio \(\frac{IJ}{XJ} = \frac{HJ}{YJ}\) is given.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangles W X J and H Y J appear similar due to the given ratio.
- Angles W X J and W Z G form a linear pair, so their sum is 180 degrees.
- The angles at point J seem to form a straight line with angles W X J and W Z G.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle W X J = 130 degrees.
- Angle W Z G = 20 degrees.
- The sum of these angles is 150 degrees.
- Angle J forms part of the straight line with these two angles, meaning angle J = 180 - 150 = 30 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle J.
- The required property is the sum of angles forming a straight line.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the angles and their relationships.
