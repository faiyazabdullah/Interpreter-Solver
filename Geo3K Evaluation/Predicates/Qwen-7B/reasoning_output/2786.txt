STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2786
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find X W.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle XYZ with vertices labeled X, Y, Z.
- Side XY is marked as 12 units long.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex Z indicating that angle XYZ is a right angle.
- Points W and Y are on line segment XY.
- Points X, Y, and Z are connected forming a right triangle.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle XYZ is a right triangle with right angle at vertex Z.
- Lines XZ and YZ form the legs of the triangle.
- Line XY forms the hypotenuse.
- Points W and Y divide line segment XY into two segments, but there's no indication of lengths for WX or WY.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of XY is given as 12 units.
- The lengths of XZ and YZ need to be determined since they are sides of the right triangle XYZ.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of XW.
- Since WX + WY = XY, and XY is known to be 12 units, we need to determine WX or WY if necessary.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the right triangle, right angle, and the fact that XY is the hypotenuse.
- We also need to represent the relationship between WX and WY if WX + WY = XY.
