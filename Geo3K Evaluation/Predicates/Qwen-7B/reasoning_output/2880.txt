STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2880
================================================================================
QUESTION: In \odot P, m \angle M P L = 65 and N P \perp P L. Find m \widehat N J K.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle centered at \(P\) with points \(J, K, L, M, N\) on its circumference.
- Points \(M\) and \(N\) are marked with red dots.
- \(NP\) is perpendicular to \(PL\).
- \(\angle MPL = 65^\circ\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \(NP \perp PL\): This implies \(NP\) is perpendicular to \(PL\).
- \(\angle MPL = 65^\circ\): This angle is given.
- Since \(NP \perp PL\), \(\angle NPM = 90^\circ\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(m\angle MPL = 65^\circ\) (given).
- \(NP \perp PL\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \(m\widehat{NJK}\).
- We need to determine the measure of the arc \(\widehat{NJK}\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circle, the perpendicular line, and the given angle.
- We also need to express the relationship involving the arc.
