STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2413
================================================================================
QUESTION: In rhombus A B C D, m \angle D A B = 2, m \angle A D C and C B = 6. Find m \angle A C D.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a rhombus ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D
- Side AB is marked as 6 units
- Diagonal AC is marked as $ (unknown length)
- Diagonal BD is marked as $ (unknown length)
- Angle DAB is marked as 2 degrees
- The diagonals AC and BD intersect at point E, which appears to be the midpoint of both diagonals

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Rhombus ABCD has all sides equal
- Diagonals AC and BD bisect each other at right angles
- Diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular to each other
- Angles DAB and ADC are congruent because they are opposite angles in the rhombus
- Angles BAD and ABC are congruent because they are adjacent angles in the rhombus

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 6 units (given)
- AC = $ (unknown length)
- BD = $ (unknown length)
- m∠DAB = 2° (given)

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle ACD
- This requires using the properties of a rhombus and the relationships between its angles and diagonals

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the rhombus, angles, diagonals, and relationships
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties
