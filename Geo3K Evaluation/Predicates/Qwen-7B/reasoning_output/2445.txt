STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2445
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure with a triangle ECD and a smaller triangle GCD within it.
- Angle E is 45 degrees, angle D is 30 degrees, and angle G is 90 degrees due to the right angle symbol.
- Side EC is marked as 8 units long.
- Side CD is marked as y units long.
- Side GD is marked as x units long.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ECD is a right triangle with right angle at G.
- Angle E is 45 degrees, implying triangle ECG is a 45-45-90 triangle.
- Angle D is 30 degrees, implying triangle GCD is a 30-60-90 triangle.
- Side EC is 8 units, which is the hypotenuse of triangle ECG.
- Side CD is y, which is the longer leg of triangle ECG and the shorter leg of triangle GCD.
- Side GD is x, which is the shorter leg of triangle ECG and the hypotenuse of triangle GCD.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- EC = 8 units (given).
- EC is the hypotenuse of triangle ECG.
- GD is the hypotenuse of triangle GCD and the shorter leg of triangle ECG.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for x.
- Since triangle ECG is a 45-45-90 triangle, its sides are in the ratio 1:1:√2.
- Since triangle GCD is a 30-60-90 triangle, its sides are in the ratio 1:√3:2.
- The hypotenuse of triangle ECG (EC) is 8 units.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangles, right angles, lengths, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
