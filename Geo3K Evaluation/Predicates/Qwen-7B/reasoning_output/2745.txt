STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2745
================================================================================
QUESTION: A B C D is a parallelogram with side lengths as indicated in the figure at the right. The perimeter of A B C D is 22. Find A B.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a parallelogram ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, and D.
- Side AB is labeled as \(2y + 1\).
- Side CD is labeled as \(3 - 4w\).
- Side AD is labeled as \(3x - 2\).
- Side BC is labeled as \(x - w + 1\).
- Right angle symbols are present at vertices A and D, indicating these are right angles.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure is a parallelogram, so opposite sides are equal.
- Therefore, AB = CD and AD = BC.
- AB = \(2y + 1\) and CD = \(3 - 4w\).
- AD = \(3x - 2\) and BC = \(x - w + 1\).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = \(2y + 1\)
- CD = \(3 - 4w\)
- AD = \(3x - 2\)
- BC = \(x - w + 1\)

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The perimeter of the parallelogram ABCD is given as 22.
- The perimeter of a parallelogram is calculated as \(2 \times (\text{sum of adjacent sides})\).
- Thus, the perimeter formula is \(2 \times ((AB + BC)) = 22\).
- Substitute the given side lengths into the perimeter formula:
  \[
  2 \times ((2y + 1) + (x - w + 1)) = 22
  \]
- Simplify the equation:
  \[
  2 \times (2y + x - w + 2) = 22
  \]
- Divide both sides by 2:
  \[
  2y + x - w + 2 = 11
  \]
- Subtract 2 from both sides:
  \[
  2y + x - w = 9
  \]

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, right angles, measurements, and the perimeter constraint.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
