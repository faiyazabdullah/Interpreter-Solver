STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2485
================================================================================
QUESTION: In rhombus A B C D, A B = 2 x + 3 and B C = 5 x. Find m \angle A E B.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rhombus labeled A B C D.
- Points A, B, C, D are vertices.
- Lines AB, BC, CD, DA are sides of the rhombus.
- Points A, B, C, D lie on the rhombus's perimeter.
- Line segments AB and BC are given lengths.
- Angle AEB is the angle we need to find.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCD forms a rhombus.
- AB = 2x + 3.
- BC = 5x.
- Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal, so AB = BC.
- Therefore, 2x + 3 = 5x.
- Solving for x gives x = 1.
- AB = BC = 2*1 + 3 = 5.
- Since ABCD is a rhombus, opposite angles are equal and adjacent angles sum to 180 degrees.
- Angle AEB is half the measure of angle ACD because E is the intersection of diagonals AC and BD in a rhombus.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 5.
- BC = 5.
- Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal.
- To find angle AEB, we need to know angle ACD.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle AEB.
- We need to use the fact that the diagonals of a rhombus bisect the angles.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the rhombus, its sides, and the angles.
- The relationship between the angles will be key in finding the measure of angle AEB.
