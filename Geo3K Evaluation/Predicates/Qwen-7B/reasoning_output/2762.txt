STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2762
================================================================================
QUESTION: \triangle A B C \sim \triangle F D G. Find the value of x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows two triangles: \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle DFG\).
- Both triangles have vertices labeled \(A, B, C\) and \(D, F, G\) respectively.
- The triangle \(\triangle ABC\) has sides \(AB = 15\), \(BC = x\), and \(AC\) is the hypotenuse.
- The triangle \(\triangle DFG\) has sides \(DF = 12\), \(FG = 8\), and \(DG\) is the hypotenuse.
- The triangles appear similar due to the similarity condition mentioned in the question.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \(\triangle ABC \sim \triangle DFG\).
- The triangles are similar because corresponding angles are equal and corresponding sides are proportional.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(AB = 15\).
- \(DF = 12\).
- \(FG = 8\).
- We need to find \(x\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the value of \(x\).
- Since the triangles are similar, we can use the property of similar triangles that states the ratios of corresponding sides are equal.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangles as \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle DFG\).
- Represent the similarity relationship.
- Use the similarity ratio to find the value of \(x\).
