STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2515
================================================================================
QUESTION: \triangle R S T \cong \triangle A B C. Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles, \( \triangle RST \) and \( \triangle ABC \).
- Triangle \( \triangle RST \) has vertices \( R, S, T \) and sides \( RS, ST, RT \).
- Triangle \( \triangle ABC \) has vertices \( A, B, C \) and sides \( AB, BC, AC \).
- Side \( RS \) is labeled as \( 5x + 20 \).
- Side \( ST \) is labeled as \( 2y - 8 \).
- Side \( RT \) is labeled as \( y + 13 \).
- Side \( AB \) is labeled as \( 3x + 40 \).
- Side \( BC \) is labeled as \( y + 13 \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangles \( \triangle RST \) and \( \triangle ABC \) are congruent (\( \triangle RST \cong \triangle ABC \)).
- Corresponding sides and angles are equal due to the congruence.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( RS = 5x + 20 \)
- \( ST = 2y - 8 \)
- \( RT = y + 13 \)
- \( AB = 3x + 40 \)
- \( BC = y + 13 \)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find \( x \).
- Since \( \triangle RST \cong \triangle ABC \), corresponding sides are equal:
  - \( RS = AB \)
  - \( ST = BC \)
  - \( RT = AC \)

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the congruence of triangles.
- Represent the equality of corresponding sides.
