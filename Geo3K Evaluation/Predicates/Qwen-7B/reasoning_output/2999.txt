================================================================================
QUESTION: The square is circumscribed to the circle. Find the exact circumference of the circle.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a square with vertices labeled A, B, C, and D.
- The square has a circumscribed circle.
- The circle is tangent to all four sides of the square.
- The square's side length is 14 yards.
- Right angle symbols are present at each corner of the square.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The square's diagonals intersect at the center of the circle.
- The center of the circle coincides with the intersection of the diagonals of the square.
- The circle's diameter is equal to the diagonal of the square.
- The square's side length is 14 yards.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The side length of the square is 14 yards.
- The diagonal of the square can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the circumference of the circle.
- The relationship between the side length of the square and the diameter of the circle needs to be used.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the square, circle, and their relationship.
