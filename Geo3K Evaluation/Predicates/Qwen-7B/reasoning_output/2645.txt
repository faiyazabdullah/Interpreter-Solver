STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2645
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find h in the triangle.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AB is marked as 30 degrees
- Side BC is marked as 22 units
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at B
- Sides AB and BC are perpendicular
- Side AC is the hypotenuse

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle A is 30 degrees
- BC = 22 units (given)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of AC
- This requires using trigonometric relationships in the right triangle

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties
