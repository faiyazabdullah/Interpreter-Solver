STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2947
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- Side AC is marked as \(18\sqrt{3}\).
- Side AB is marked as \(18\sqrt{3}\).
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at B.
- Sides AB and BC are perpendicular.
- Side AC is the hypotenuse.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = \(18\sqrt{3}\) units (given).
- BC = \(18\sqrt{3}\) units (given).
- AC = \(x\) units (variable).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of AC (\(x\)).
- This requires using the Pythagorean theorem since ABC is a right triangle.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
