STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2967
================================================================================
QUESTION: If C E = t - 2. E B = t + 1, C D = 2, and C A = 10, find C E.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, and D.
- Line segments AB and CD are marked with pink arrows, indicating they are parallel.
- Points E and D lie on line segment AB.
- Points C and E lie on line segment AD.
- Line segments CE and EB are labeled with numerical expressions.
- Given lengths:
  - CE = t - 2
  - EB = t + 1
  - CD = 2
  - CA = 10

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Line segment AB is parallel to line segment CD (pink arrows).
- Line segment AD intersects line segments AB and CD.
- Points E and D lie on line segment AB.
- Points C and E lie on line segment AD.
- Triangle ADE is formed by points A, D, and E.
- Triangle ACE is formed by points A, C, and E.
- The total length of AD is the sum of segments CD and DA.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- CE = t - 2
- EB = t + 1
- CD = 2
- CA = 10

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the length of CE.
- The length of CE is given by the expression t - 2.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the parallel relationship between AB and CD.
- We need to express the given lengths and relationships involving CE.
