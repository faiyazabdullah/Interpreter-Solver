STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2468
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the measure of the altitude drawn to the hypotenuse.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle GEF with vertices labeled G, E, F.
- Side GF is marked as 16 units.
- Side EF is marked as 12 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex E.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle GEF is a right triangle with right angle at vertex E.
- Sides GE and EF are perpendicular.
- Side GF is the hypotenuse.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- GF = 16 units (given)
- EF = 12 units (given)
- We need to find the measure of the altitude drawn to the hypotenuse.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of the altitude drawn to the hypotenuse.
- This requires using the geometric relationships visible in the triangle.
- The problem involves finding the altitude of a right triangle.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
