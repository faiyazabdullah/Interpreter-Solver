STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2722
================================================================================
QUESTION: Each pair of polygons is similar. Find y.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image contains two triangles labeled \( \triangle ABC \) and \( \triangle DEF \).
- Both triangles have right angles at \( \angle A \) and \( \angle E \) respectively.
- Triangle \( \triangle ABC \) has sides labeled as follows:
  - \( AB = 12 \)
  - \( BC = 20 \)
  - \( AC = 2x \)
- Triangle \( \triangle DEF \) has sides labeled as follows:
  - \( DE = y + 4 \)
  - \( EF = 15 \)
  - \( DF = 12 \)

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Both triangles are right triangles (\( \angle A \) and \( \angle E \) are right angles).
- The triangles are similar because they share a right angle and have proportional side lengths.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Given side lengths:
  - \( AB = 12 \)
  - \( BC = 20 \)
  - \( AC = 2x \)
  - \( DE = y + 4 \)
  - \( EF = 15 \)
  - \( DF = 12 \)

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- We need to find \( y \) using the similarity of the triangles.
- Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal:
  \[
  \frac{AB}{DE} = \frac{BC}{EF} = \frac{AC}{DF}
  \]
- Using the given side lengths:
  \[
  \frac{12}{y + 4} = \frac{20}{15} = \frac{2x}{12}
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangles and their similarities.
- Use the ratios to find \( y \).
