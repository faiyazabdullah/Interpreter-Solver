STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2512
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle \(ABC\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\).
- Side \(AB\) is marked as \(y\).
- Side \(BC\) is marked as \(x\).
- Side \(AC\) is marked as 12 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex \(B\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \(ABC\) is a right triangle with a right angle at \(B\).
- Sides \(AB\) and \(BC\) are perpendicular.
- Side \(AC\) is the hypotenuse.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The lengths of sides are given as follows:
  - \(AC = 12\) units.
  - \(AB = y\) units.
  - \(BC = x\) units.
- The question asks for the value of \(x\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of side \(BC\).
- Since \(ABC\) is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find \(x\).
- The Pythagorean theorem states: \(AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include the Pythagorean theorem equation.
