STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2863
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the measure of \angle 7 if m \angle 4 = m \angle 5.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image contains multiple triangles and a pentagon.
- Triangles FBC, EBD, and ABD are labeled with specific angles and side lengths.
- The pentagon ABCDEG is marked with internal angles and side lengths.
- Angles are labeled as 63°, 69°, and 47°.
- Sides are labeled as 5, 6, 7, and 2.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle FBC has angle 63° at vertex F.
- Triangle EBD has angle 69° at vertex E.
- Triangle ABD has angle 47° at vertex B.
- Triangle FBC and EBD share point B.
- Triangle ABD shares point B and side BD.
- The pentagon ABCDEG is labeled with angles and side lengths.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle 1 = 63°
- Angle 2 = 69°
- Angle 3 = 47°
- Side lengths: BC = 5, BD = 6, DE = 7, FA = 2.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle 7 if \( m\angle 4 = m\angle 5 \).
- Since no explicit relationship between angles 4 and 5 is given, we assume they are equal based on the problem statement.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangles and pentagon.
- Capture the angles and side lengths.
- Ensure relationships between the angles and sides are included.
