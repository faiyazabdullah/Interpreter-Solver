STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2636
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the value of the variable x in the figure.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a triangle ABC with vertices A, B, and C.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B.
- The measure of angle A is given as 55°.
- No other specific measurements or labels are provided for sides or angles.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with the right angle at vertex B.
- Sides AB and BC are perpendicular.
- The measure of angle A is given as 55°.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The measure of angle A is explicitly given as 55°.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle A.
- The measure of angle A is directly provided in the diagram.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle and the right angle property.
- The measure of angle A is already provided.
