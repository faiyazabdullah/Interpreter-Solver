STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2931
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find w in the given parallelogram.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a parallelogram with vertices labeled A, F, G, J.
- Lines AF, AG, FG, and JF are marked with lengths \(2b + 5\), \(2w + 3\), \(3b + 1\), and \(4w - 7\) respectively.
- The parallelogram properties suggest that opposite sides are equal, so \(AF = JG\) and \(AG = FH\).

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since it's a parallelogram, \(AF = JG\) and \(AG = FH\).
- \(AF = JG \Rightarrow 2b + 5 = 3b + 1\).
- \(AG = FH \Rightarrow 2w + 3 = 4w - 7\).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The lengths given are \(2b + 5\), \(2w + 3\), \(3b + 1\), and \(4w - 7\).
- We need to find the values of \(b\) and \(w\).

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find \(w\).
- We need to solve the equation derived from the parallelogram property.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to express the equality constraints for the lengths.
