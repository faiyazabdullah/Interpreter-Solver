STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2662
================================================================================
QUESTION: H K and I G are diameters of \odot L. Find m \widehat I H J.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows a circle centered at \( L \).
- Points \( H, I, J, K, G \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
- \( H \) and \( I \) are endpoints of a diameter.
- \( I \) and \( J \) are endpoints of another diameter.
- \( I \) is marked as the center of the circle.
- An angle \( \angle HIJ \) is labeled as \( 59^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since \( I \) is the center of the circle, \( LI \perp LK \) and \( LJ \perp LG \).
- \( H, I, J \) form a straight line because they are endpoints of the diameter.
- \( \angle HIJ \) is given as \( 59^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The measurement of \( \angle HIJ = 59^\circ \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle IHJ \).
- Given that \( \angle HIJ = 59^\circ \) and knowing that \( I \) is the center of the circle, we need to find \( \angle IHJ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, the diameter, the angle, and its measurement.
