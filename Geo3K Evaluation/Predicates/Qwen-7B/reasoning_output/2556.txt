STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2556
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x. Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center \( C \).
- Points \( A \), \( E \), and \( B \) lie on the circle.
- Segments \( AE \) and \( BE \) are radii of the circle.
- Segment \( AB \) is a chord of the circle.
- \( \angle AEB = 6^\circ \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Points \( A \), \( E \), and \( B \) are equidistant from point \( C \) because they lie on the circumference of the circle.
- \( AE \) and \( BE \) are radii of the circle and thus equal in length.
- \( AB \) is a straight line segment connecting two points on the circle, forming a chord.
- \( \angle AEB \) is given as \( 6^\circ \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( AE = EB = 8 \) (radii of the circle).
- \( AB = 16 \) (chord length).
- \( \angle AEB = 6^\circ \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( x \), which is the angle subtended by the chord \( AB \) at the center \( C \).
- Since \( AE \) and \( BE \) are radii, \( \triangle AEC \) and \( \triangle BEC \) are isosceles triangles with \( AE = EC \) and \( BE = EC \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, points on the circle, radii, chord, and the angle subtended by the chord at the center.
