STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2471
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the trapezoid.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows a trapezoid \(ABCD\) with vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- The lengths of sides \(AB\) and \(DC\) are given as 22 ft and 37 ft, respectively.
- The height of the trapezoid is given as 23 ft.
- The diagram includes right angle symbols at the top corners where the height meets the bases \(AB\) and \(CD\).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The trapezoid has two parallel sides, \(AB\) and \(DC\).
- The non-parallel sides \(AD\) and \(BC\) are perpendicular to the bases \(AB\) and \(DC\), forming right angles.
- The height of the trapezoid is perpendicular to both bases.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of \(AB = 22\) ft.
- Length of \(DC = 37\) ft.
- Height (altitude) of the trapezoid \(AE = EC = 23\) ft.
- No other lengths or angles are explicitly given.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the trapezoid.
- The formula for the area of a trapezoid is \(\frac{1}{2} \times (b_1 + b_2) \times h\), where \(b_1\) and \(b_2\) are the lengths of the two parallel sides, and \(h\) is the height.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the trapezoid, its parallel sides, height, and the area formula.
