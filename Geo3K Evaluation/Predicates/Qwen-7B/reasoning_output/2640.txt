STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2640
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x. Assume that any segment that appears to be tangent is tangent.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure with points A, B, C, D, F, E.
- There are two circles with center O.
- There are two arcs: one from B to C, and the other from D to E.
- Points A, B, C, and D lie on one circle.
- Points E, F, and D lie on another circle.
- The arc from B to C subtends an angle of \(4x + 50^\circ\).
- The arc from D to E subtends an angle of \(30^\circ\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Points A, B, C, and D form a cyclic quadrilateral because they lie on a single circle.
- Points E, F, and D also form a cyclic quadrilateral because they lie on another circle.
- The sum of the opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral equals \(180^\circ\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The angle subtended by the arc BC is \(4x + 50^\circ\).
- The angle subtended by the arc DE is \(30^\circ\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \(x\).
- The relationship between the angles in the cyclic quadrilateral can be used to solve for \(x\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the cyclic quadrilaterals, the angles subtended by the arcs, and the relationship between the angles.
