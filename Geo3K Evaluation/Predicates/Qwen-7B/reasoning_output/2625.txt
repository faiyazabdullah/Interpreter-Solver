STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2625
================================================================================
QUESTION: Quadrilateral D E F G is a rectangle. If m \angle E F D = 2 x - 3 and m \angle D F G = x + 12, find m \angle E F D.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a rectangle DEFG with vertices labeled D, E, F, G
- Side DE is marked as 1 unit
- Side DF is marked as 3 units
- There are right angle symbols at vertices D and G

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral DEFG is a rectangle
- Angles DFE and EFD form right angles
- Opposite sides DE and FG are parallel and equal
- Opposite sides DG and EF are parallel and equal

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- DE = 1 unit (given)
- DF = 3 units (given)
- Since it's a rectangle, EF = DG = DF = 3 units
- Since it's a rectangle, DE = GF = DE = 1 unit

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of âˆ EFD
- This requires using the geometric relationships in the rectangle

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the rectangle, right angles, lengths, and relationships
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties
