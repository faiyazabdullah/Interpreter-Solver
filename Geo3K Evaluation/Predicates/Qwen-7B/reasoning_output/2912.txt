STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2912
================================================================================
QUESTION: In the figure, m \angle 12 = 64. Find the measure of \angle 7.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure with multiple triangles and lines.
- There are angles labeled with numbers, such as \( \angle 1 \), \( \angle 2 \), etc.
- Lines and angles are marked with specific measures where applicable.
- There is a triangle labeled \( \triangle 12 \) with vertex \( G \).
- The angle \( \angle 12 \) is explicitly marked with the measure \( 64^\circ \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure appears to be composed of triangles, likely involving angles and lines.
- The triangle \( \triangle 12 \) is central to the analysis.
- The angle \( \angle 12 \) is part of the triangle and its measure is given as \( 64^\circ \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The measure of \( \angle 12 \) is given as \( 64^\circ \).
- No other numerical values are explicitly stated in the diagram.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 7 \).
- Since \( \angle 12 \) is already marked with a specific measure, we need to determine if there's a relationship between \( \angle 7 \) and \( \angle 12 \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, the given angle measure, and the relationship between the angles.
- The predicates will reflect the geometric relationships and the given angle measure.
