STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2901
================================================================================
QUESTION: \triangle W X Y \cong \triangle W X Z. Find y.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle \( \triangle WXZ \) with vertices labeled \( W \), \( X \), and \( Z \).
- Vertex \( W \) has two rays extending to form the right angle at \( X \).
- The right angle symbol indicates that \( \angle WXZ = 90^\circ \).
- Side \( WX \) is perpendicular to side \( XZ \).
- Side \( XY \) is labeled as 19 units.
- Side \( XZ \) is labeled as \( 3y + 7 \) units.
- Side \( WZ \) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle \( \triangle WXZ \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \( \triangle WXZ \) is a right triangle with \( \angle WXZ = 90^\circ \).
- \( WX \) is perpendicular to \( XZ \).
- \( WX \) is the height from the right angle vertex to the base \( XZ \).
- \( WZ \) is the hypotenuse.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( XY = 19 \) units.
- \( XZ = 3y + 7 \) units.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the value of \( y \).
- To solve for \( y \), we use the Pythagorean theorem since \( \triangle WXZ \) is a right triangle.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the right triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
