STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2490
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x so that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D.
- Side AB is marked as \(x + 4\).
- Side BC is marked as 55째.
- Side CD is marked as 60째.
- Side DA is marked as \(3x - 6\).
- There are no right angles or perpendicular lines marked.
- The quadrilateral appears to have some symmetry or specific angle relationships that might imply it is a parallelogram.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The quadrilateral ABCD appears to have opposite sides equal because \(AB = CD\) and \(BC = AD\). If this is true, then ABCD could be a parallelogram.
- Since the diagonals intersect at point E, we need to check if they bisect each other.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = \(x + 4\)
- BC = 55째 (This seems to be an angle measurement, not a length, so we should focus on lengths.)
- CD = 60째 (Also an angle, not a length.)
- DA = \(3x - 6\)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \(x\) such that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.
- For ABCD to be a parallelogram, \(AB = CD\) and \(BC = DA\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to express the relationships between the sides and the condition for the quadrilateral to be a parallelogram.
