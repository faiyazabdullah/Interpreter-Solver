STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2509
================================================================================
QUESTION: In the figure, m \angle 1 = 123. Find the measure of \angle 14.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram contains multiple lines and points.
- The points are labeled as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q.
- Lines are connected to form triangles, parallelograms, and possibly rectangles.
- Angles are marked with numbers like 1, 2, 3, etc., indicating specific angles.
- Some lines are labeled with numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.), indicating lengths.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- There are triangles and parallelograms formed by the lines.
- Some angles are marked, such as angle 1.
- No right angles are explicitly marked, so we assume no specific right angles unless otherwise stated.
- Parallel lines are not explicitly marked, so they are assumed based on the structure of the diagram.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angles are labeled as 1 through 14.
- No specific lengths are marked for the sides of the shapes, except for the angles.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle 14.
- The relationship between angles is not explicitly provided, so we need to infer from the geometric properties.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the relationships between the angles.
- Since no specific lengths are given for sides, we cannot determine the measures of angles without additional geometric properties or theorems.
