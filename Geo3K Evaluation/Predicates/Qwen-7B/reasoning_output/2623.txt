STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2623
================================================================================
QUESTION: For trapezoid A B C D, S and T are midpoints of the legs. If A B = x + 4, C D = 3 x + 2, and S T = 9, find A B.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a trapezoid \(ABCD\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- Midpoints \(S\) and \(T\) are marked on the non-parallel sides \(AC\) and \(BD\) respectively.
- \(AB = x + 4\), \(CD = 3x + 2\), and \(ST = 9\) are provided.
- \(AB\) and \(CD\) are the bases of the trapezoid.
- \(ST\) is the segment connecting the midpoints of the non-parallel sides.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \(AB\) and \(CD\) are the lengths of the bases of the trapezoid.
- \(AB \neq CD\) indicating it is not an isosceles trapezoid.
- \(ST\) is the midsegment (or median) of the trapezoid.
- According to the Midsegment Theorem, the midsegment \(ST\) is half the sum of the lengths of the two bases: \(ST = \frac{AB + CD}{2}\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(AB = x + 4\)
- \(CD = 3x + 2\)
- \(ST = 9\)

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the length of \(AB\).
- We need to use the Midsegment Theorem: \(ST = \frac{AB + CD}{2}\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the trapezoid, its midpoints, lengths, and the relationship between them.
- The Midsegment Theorem will be used to express the relationship between the segments.
