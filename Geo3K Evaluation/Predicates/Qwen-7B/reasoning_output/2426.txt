STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2426
================================================================================
QUESTION: For the pair of similar figures, use the given areas to find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image contains two rectangles.
- The first rectangle has dimensions labeled as 4 inches in width and its area is given as 8 square inches.
- The second rectangle has a variable length \(x\) in inches and its area is given as 32 square inches.
- Both rectangles share the same height.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The rectangles are similar because they have the same height.
- The relationship between the areas of similar rectangles is given by the ratio of the squares of corresponding sides.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Width of the first rectangle: 4 inches
- Area of the first rectangle: 8 square inches
- Width of the second rectangle: \(x\) inches
- Area of the second rectangle: 32 square inches

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- We need to find the value of \(x\).
- Since the rectangles are similar, the ratio of their areas is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the rectangles and their areas.
- Use the similarity property to set up the equation relating the areas.
