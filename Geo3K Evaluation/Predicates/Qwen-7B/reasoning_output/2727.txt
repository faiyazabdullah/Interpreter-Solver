STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2727
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the measure of \angle Z to the nearest tenth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle XYZ with vertices labeled X, Y, Z
- Side XY is marked as 5 units
- Side YZ is marked as 9 units
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex Y

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle XYZ is a right triangle with right angle at vertex Y
- Sides XY and YZ are perpendicular
- Side XZ is the hypotenuse

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- XY = 5 units (given)
- YZ = 9 units (given)
- XZ length is what the question is asking for

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of âˆ Z to the nearest tenth
- This requires using the geometric relationships visible in the triangle
- The problem involves finding the measure of an angle in a right triangle

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties
