STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2860
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the value of the variable t.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AB is marked as 12 units
- Side BC is marked as \(t + 1\) units
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at B
- Sides AB and BC are perpendicular
- Side AC is the hypotenuse

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 12 units (given)
- BC = \(t + 1\) units (given)
- AC length is what the question is asking for

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of the variable \(t\)
- This requires using the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse AC

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties
