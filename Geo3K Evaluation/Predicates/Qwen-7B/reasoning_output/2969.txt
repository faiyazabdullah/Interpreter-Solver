STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2969
================================================================================
QUESTION: The degree measure of minor arc \widehat A C and major arc \widehat A D C are x and y respectively. If m \angle A B C = 70, find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center E and two arcs: minor arc AC and major arc ADC.
- The minor arc AC is labeled as \(x\).
- The major arc ADC is labeled as \(y\).
- The point B lies outside the circle such that angle ABC is given as 70 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The point B forms an external angle with respect to the circle at point C.
- The angle ABC is given as 70 degrees.
- The relationship between the minor arc AC and the angle ABC is related through the inscribed angle theorem, where the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The measure of angle ABC is 70 degrees.
- The minor arc AC intercepts this angle, so according to the inscribed angle theorem, the measure of the minor arc AC (\(x\)) is twice the measure of angle ABC.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of the minor arc AC (\(x\)).
- We need to use the inscribed angle theorem to find the value of \(x\).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- The inscribed angle theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.
- We need to express this relationship mathematically.
