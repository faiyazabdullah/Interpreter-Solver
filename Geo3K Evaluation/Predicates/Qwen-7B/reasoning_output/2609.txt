STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2609
================================================================================
QUESTION: In \odot M, F L = 24, H J = 48, and m \widehat H P = 65. Find m \widehat H J.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center \( M \).
- Points \( F, L, H, J, P, K, G \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
- Right angle symbols are present at point \( L \) and point \( N \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( F, L, H, J, P, K, G \) are points on the circumference of the circle.
- \( L \) and \( N \) have right angle symbols, indicating right angles.
- The arc \( HP \) has a measure of 65 degrees.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( FL = 24 \)
- \( HJ = 48 \)
- \( \text{m} \widehat{HP} = 65 \)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of arc \( HJ \).
- Since arc \( HP \) measures 65 degrees, we need to find the measure of arc \( HJ \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, the right angles, the given lengths, and the arc measures.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
