STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2643
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x in the figure.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a geometric figure with multiple triangles and lines.
- There are several labeled points: A, B, C, D, E, G, H.
- Lines are marked connecting these points.
- Angles are labeled with expressions involving x and y.
- Right angle symbols are present at specific intersections.
- Numerical expressions are given for some angles: \(7x + 9\), \(7y - 4\), and \(11x - 1\).
- Another angle is labeled as \(2y + 5\).

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangles are formed by the lines connecting the points.
- Right angles are marked at some intersections, implying perpendicular lines.
- The angles at certain points form linear pairs or supplementary angles due to the right angles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Expressions involving x and y are given for the angles.
- The goal seems to involve solving for x using the given angle expressions.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of x.
- This likely involves using the properties of angles in triangles or linear pairs, given the right angles and angle expressions.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the angles and their relationships.
- Must capture the given expressions for the angles.
