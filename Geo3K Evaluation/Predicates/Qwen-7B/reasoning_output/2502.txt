STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2502
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle 4.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- An angle \(\angle D\) is labeled as \(123^\circ\).
- A right angle symbol is placed at point \(C\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral \(ABCD\) includes a right angle at \(C\).
- The presence of a right angle implies that \(\angle C = 90^\circ\).
- The sum of interior angles in a quadrilateral is \(360^\circ\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The measurement of \(\angle D\) is given as \(123^\circ\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \(\angle 4\).
- Since \(\angle D\) is already specified, we need to find the measure of \(\angle 4\), which appears to be \(\angle B\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the quadrilateral, the right angle, the given angle measure, and the relationships between the angles.
