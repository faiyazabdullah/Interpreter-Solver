STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2628
================================================================================
QUESTION: In \odot M, F L = 24, H J = 48, and m \widehat H P = 65. Find N J.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle centered at point \(M\) with points \(F\), \(L\), \(H\), \(J\), \(P\), \(G\), and \(K\) marked on it.
- Line segment \(FL\) is marked as having a length of 24.
- Line segment \(HJ\) is marked as having a length of 48.
- Arc \(HP\) is marked with a measure of 65 degrees.
- Points \(L\) and \(N\) form right angles with the respective lines they intersect within the circle.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The points \(F\), \(L\), \(H\), and \(J\) lie on the circumference of the circle.
- \(F\), \(L\), \(H\), \(J\), and \(P\) are connected by straight lines forming chords of the circle.
- \(L\) and \(N\) form right angles with the lines \(FM\) and \(PM\) respectively.
- Arc \(HP\) subtends an angle at the center of the circle.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(FL = 24\)
- \(HJ = 48\)
- \(m \widehat{H}P = 65^\circ\)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \(NJ\).
- The relevant geometric property here is the relationship involving the central angle and its corresponding arc length.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circle, the lengths of the chords, the right angles, and the central angle.
- Since the question specifically asks for \(NJ\), we will focus on the relationship involving the central angle and the corresponding arc length.
