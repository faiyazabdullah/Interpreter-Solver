STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2830
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows two parallelograms.
- The top parallelogram has sides labeled as \(7x - 2\) and \(4x + 3\).
- The bottom parallelogram has one side labeled as 8.
- Both parallelograms share a common side labeled as 8.
- There are no right angles, perpendicular lines, or circles present.
- The question asks to find the value of \(x\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The parallelograms are identical in shape and size.
- The lengths of the sides of the parallelograms are related linearly through the expressions \(7x - 2\) and \(4x + 3\).
- Since the parallelograms are equal in shape and size, the sum of the lengths of the opposite sides must be equal.
- The shared side is 8, so the total length of the non-shared sides must also be equal.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The measurement given for the side of the top parallelogram is \(7x - 2\).
- The measurement given for the side of the bottom parallelogram is \(4x + 3\).
- One side of the bottom parallelogram is explicitly labeled as 8.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the value of \(x\).
- We need to use the relationship between the side lengths of the parallelograms to solve for \(x\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the parallelograms, their sides, and the linear relationships between the sides.
- The predicates will capture the equality of the sums of the sides.
