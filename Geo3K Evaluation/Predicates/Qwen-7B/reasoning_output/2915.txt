STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2915
================================================================================
QUESTION: In \odot O, E C and A B are diameters, and \angle B O D \cong \angle D O E \cong \angle E O F \cong \angle F O A. Find m \widehat A D.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center \( O \).
- Points \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
- Lines \( AB \) and \( CD \) are diameters of the circle.
- Angles \( \angle BOD \), \( \angle DOE \), \( \angle EOF \), and \( \angle FOA \) are congruent.
- Right angle symbols (\(\perp\)) are marked at point \( F \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since \( AB \) and \( CD \) are diameters, they pass through the center \( O \).
- \( \angle BOD \), \( \angle DOE \), \( \angle EOF \), and \( \angle FOA \) are congruent, implying they are equal.
- Right angle symbol at \( F \) indicates that line segments \( OF \) and \( EF \) are perpendicular to each other.
- The total angle around point \( O \) is \( 360^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- No numerical measurements are explicitly provided in the image.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the measure of arc \( AD \).
- Given that \( \angle BOD \cong \angle DOE \cong \angle EOF \cong \angle FOA \), the total central angle subtended by \( AD \) is part of the full circle.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circle, diameters, congruent angles, and the relationship between the angles and arcs.
