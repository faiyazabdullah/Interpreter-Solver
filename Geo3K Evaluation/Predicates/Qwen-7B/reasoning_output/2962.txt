STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2962
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the shaded sector. Round to the nearest tenth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a sector of a circle.
- The circle has a center point \( S \).
- Points \( R \), \( T \), and \( S \) are marked.
- The angle subtended by the arc \( RT \) is \( 93^\circ \).
- The radius of the circle is \( 15 \text{ mm} \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The sector is formed by the central angle \( 93^\circ \) and the radii \( SR \) and \( ST \).
- The sector is part of a circle with a radius of \( 15 \text{ mm} \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The radius \( RS = 15 \text{ mm} \).
- The angle \( \angle RST = 93^\circ \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the shaded sector.
- The area of a sector is calculated using the formula:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi r^2
  \]
  where \( \theta \) is the central angle in degrees and \( r \) is the radius.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle and sector.
- Capture the radius and the angle measure.
