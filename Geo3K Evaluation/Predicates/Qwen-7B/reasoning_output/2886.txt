STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2886
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle D.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows a cyclic quadrilateral \(ABCD\) inscribed in a circle.
- Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are vertices of the quadrilateral.
- Angles \(\angle A\), \(\angle B\), \(\angle C\), and \(\angle D\) are labeled.
- \(\angle A\) is marked as \(58^\circ\).
- \(\angle B\) is labeled as \((3y + 4)^\circ\).
- \(\angle C\) is labeled as \(2x^\circ\).
- \(\angle D\) is labeled as \((2y + 16)^\circ\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since \(ABCD\) is a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum up to \(180^\circ\).
- Therefore, \(\angle A + \angle C = 180^\circ\) and \(\angle B + \angle D = 180^\circ\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(\angle A = 58^\circ\).
- \(\angle B = (3y + 4)^\circ\).
- \(\angle C = 2x^\circ\).
- \(\angle D = (2y + 16)^\circ\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find \(m\angle D\), which is \(\angle D\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the cyclic quadrilateral, its angles, and the relationships between them.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties related to the angles.
