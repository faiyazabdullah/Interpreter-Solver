STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2844
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the parallelogram. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a parallelogram ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D
- Side AB is marked as 28 ft
- Side BC is marked as 9 ft
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B
- Angle ABC is labeled as 45°

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral ABCD is a parallelogram with right angle at B
- Sides AB and CD are parallel and equal in length
- Sides BC and AD are parallel and equal in length
- Angle ABC is 45°

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 28 ft (given)
- BC = 9 ft (given)
- Angle ABC = 45° (given)

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the parallelogram
- The area of a parallelogram is calculated as base times height

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties
