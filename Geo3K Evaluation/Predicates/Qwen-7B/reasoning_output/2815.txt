STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2815
================================================================================
QUESTION: If two sides of a triangle measure 12 and 7, which of the following cannot be the perimeter of the triangle?

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, and C.
- Side AB is marked as 12 units.
- Side BC is marked as 7 units.
- There are no right angle symbols, parallel marks, congruent marks, or other special markings indicated in the diagram.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC has sides AB and BC.
- Side AB = 12 units.
- Side BC = 7 units.
- No specific relationships between the sides are explicitly stated.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 12 units (given).
- BC = 7 units (given).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks which perimeter cannot be formed with sides measuring 12 and 7.
- To determine the possible perimeters, we need to consider the third side's length, denoted as \(c\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, its sides, and the perimeter.
- The perimeter formula for a triangle is \(P = AB + BC + AC\), where \(AC\) is the unknown side.

Given:
- AB = 12
- BC = 7
- AC = \(c\)

Possible perimeters:
- \(P = 12 + 7 + c\)
- Since the perimeter must be greater than the sum of the other two sides (\(c > |12 - 7| = 5\)), and less than the sum of the other two sides plus one (\(c < 12 + 7 = 19\)), valid \(c\) values range from 6 to 18.
