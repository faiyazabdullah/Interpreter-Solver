STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2835
================================================================================
QUESTION: A square is inscribed in a circle of area 18 \pi square units. Find the length of a side of the square.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a square inscribed in a circle.
- The circle has a label O indicating its center.
- The square is labeled ABCD.
- The circle's area is given as \(18\pi\) square units.
- Points A, B, C, D lie on the circle's circumference.
- The square appears to be rotated within the circle, but there are no specific angle markings or lengths provided for the sides of the square.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The square is inscribed in the circle.
- The circle's center O lies at the intersection of the diagonals of the square.
- The diagonals of the square are diameters of the circle.
- The circle's radius can be found from its area formula.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The area of the circle is given as \(18\pi\).
- The formula for the area of a circle is \(A = \pi r^2\).
- Solving for the radius \(r\):

\[
\pi r^2 = 18\pi \implies r^2 = 18 \implies r = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}
\]

- Since the diagonal of the square is the diameter of the circle, the diagonal length \(d\) is \(6\sqrt{2}\).

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of a side of the square.
- The relationship between the diagonal \(d\) and the side \(s\) of a square is given by \(d = s\sqrt{2}\).
- Solving for the side length \(s\):

\[
s\sqrt{2} = 6\sqrt{2} \implies s = 6
\]

However, we need to ensure our predicates capture the geometric relationships and properties without directly solving the problem.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, the square, the center point, and the relationship between the diagonal and the side of the square.
