REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with vertices labeled \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
- Side \( AB \) is marked as 3 units.
- Side \( AC \) is marked as 12 units.
- Side \( BC \) is labeled as \( z \).
- There are right angle symbols at vertices \( A \) and \( C \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angles at vertices \( A \) and \( C \).
- \( \angle BAC \) is the right angle at vertex \( A \).
- \( \angle ABC \) is the right angle at vertex \( C \).
- \( AB \) is perpendicular to \( BC \).
- \( AC \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of \( AB \): 3 units.
- Length of \( AC \): 12 units.
- Length of \( BC \): \( z \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( BC \) (denoted as \( z \)).
- To find \( z \), we use the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angles, measurements, and the Pythagorean relationship.
