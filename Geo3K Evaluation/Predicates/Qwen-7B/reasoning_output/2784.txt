STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2784
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x. Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center O and points A, B, C, D marked on it.
- Segments AD and AC are chords of the circle.
- Segments CD and CE are radii of the circle.
- Segments AB and BD are diameters of the circle.
- Segment AE is a tangent to the circle at point E.
- The lengths of segments AD and BD are given as 9 and 6 respectively.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Segment AD is a chord of the circle.
- Segment BD is a chord of the circle.
- Segments CD and CE are radii of the circle, so they are equal in length.
- Segment AE is tangent to the circle at point E.
- Segment AB is a diameter of the circle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of AD = 9
- Length of BD = 6
- Length of CE = Length of CD (since both are radii of the circle)

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the length of segment x, which appears to be related to the tangency condition.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, tangency, lengths, and relationships between segments.
