STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2834
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find z.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows a right triangle YAB with vertices Y, A, and B.
- Side AB is marked as 5 units.
- Side YB is marked as 14 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex A.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle YAB is a right triangle with right angle at A.
- Sides YB and AB are perpendicular.
- Side YA is the hypotenuse.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 5 units (given)
- YB = 14 units (given)
- YA length is what the question is asking for.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of YA.
- This requires using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle YAB.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
