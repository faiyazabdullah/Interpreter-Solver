STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2985
================================================================================
QUESTION: Each pair of polygons is similar. Find A C.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with vertices labeled \( A, B, C \).
- Side \( AB \) is marked as \( x+7 \).
- Side \( BC \) is marked as 4.
- Side \( AC \) is marked as \( 12-x \).
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex \( B \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at vertex \( B \).
- Sides \( AB \) and \( BC \) are perpendicular.
- Side \( AC \) is the hypotenuse.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( AB = x + 7 \)
- \( BC = 4 \)
- \( AC = 12 - x \)

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( AC \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
