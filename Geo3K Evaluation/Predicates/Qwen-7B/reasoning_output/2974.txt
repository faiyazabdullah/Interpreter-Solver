STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2974
================================================================================
QUESTION: P Q R S is a rhombus inscribed in a circle. Find m \widehat S P.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a rhombus PQRS inscribed in a circle.
- Points P, Q, R, and S are vertices of the rhombus.
- The center of the circle is labeled as C.
- All sides of the rhombus are equal in length.
- The diagonals PR and QS intersect at point C.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- PQRS is a rhombus inscribed in a circle, meaning it is a tangential quadrilateral.
- The diagonals of the rhombus are diameters of the circumscribed circle.
- Since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, ∠PCQ = 90°.
- Therefore, ∠SQR = ∠SRQ = ∠SPQ = ∠PQS = 90°.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- No specific numerical values are given for the lengths or angles in the diagram.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the measure of ∠SQR.
- Since ∠SQR = 90°, we need to represent this relationship.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the rhombus, its inscribed circle, and the right angles formed by the diagonals.
