STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2464
================================================================================
QUESTION: m is the perpendicular bisector of X Z, W Z = 14.9. Find W X.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle \( XYZ \) with vertices \( X \), \( Y \), and \( Z \).
- Line \( m \) is the perpendicular bisector of segment \( XZ \).
- Point \( W \) lies on line \( m \).
- Segment \( WZ \) is labeled as 14.9 units.
- Point \( Y \) is the intersection of line \( m \) and segment \( XZ \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \( XYZ \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( Y \).
- Line \( m \) is the perpendicular bisector of segment \( XZ \).
- Segment \( WZ \) is congruent to segment \( WX \) because \( W \) lies on the perpendicular bisector of \( XZ \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( WZ = 14.9 \) units.
- Since \( m \) is the perpendicular bisector, \( WX = WZ \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( WX \).
- Given \( WZ = 14.9 \), it follows that \( WX = 14.9 \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the right triangle, the perpendicular bisector, and the measurement \( WZ \).
