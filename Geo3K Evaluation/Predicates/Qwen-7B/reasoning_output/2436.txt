STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2436
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle 2 if m \widehat B C = 30 and m \widehat A D = 20.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a cyclic quadrilateral \(ABCD\) inscribed in a circle with center \(O\).
- Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) lie on the circumference.
- Angles \(\angle ABC = 30^\circ\) and \(\angle ADB = 20^\circ\) are marked.
- The arc \(\widehat{BC}\) subtends \(\angle BOC = 60^\circ\) because the central angle is twice the inscribed angle subtended by the same arc.
- The arc \(\widehat{AD}\) subtends \(\angle AOD = 40^\circ\) because the central angle is twice the inscribed angle subtended by the same arc.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is cyclic since it lies on a common circle.
- \(\angle BOC = 60^\circ\) implies \(\angle BAC + \angle BDC = 60^\circ\) due to the property of cyclic quadrilaterals.
- \(\angle ADB = 20^\circ\) implies \(\angle ABD + \angle ADB = 90^\circ\) because \(\angle ADB\) is the inscribed angle opposite the semicircle formed by the arc \(AD\).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(\angle BOC = 60^\circ\)
- \(\angle ADB = 20^\circ\)
- \(\angle BAC + \angle BDC = 60^\circ\)

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \(\angle 2\), which is \(\angle BAC\).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the cyclic quadrilateral, the arcs, the central angles, and the inscribed angles.
