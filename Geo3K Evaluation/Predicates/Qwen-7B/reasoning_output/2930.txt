STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2930
================================================================================
QUESTION: Use a calculator to find the measure of \angle J to the nearest degree.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle JKL with vertices labeled J, K, L.
- Side JK is marked as 14 units.
- Side KL is marked as 9 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex J.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle JKL is a right triangle with right angle at J.
- Sides JK and KL are perpendicular.
- Side JL is the hypotenuse.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- JK = 14 units (given)
- KL = 9 units (given)
- JL length is what the question is asking for.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of âˆ J.
- This requires using the trigonometric functions in the right triangle.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
