STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2492
================================================================================
QUESTION: A B \cong D F. Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with a diameter DE and two perpendicular chords AB and CF intersecting at point L.
- Chord AB is marked as \(9x\).
- Chord CF is marked as \(2x + 14\).
- Chord AB intersects chord CF at point L, forming right angles at L with both chords.
- Diameter DE passes through the center of the circle.
- Chord AB is congruent to chord DF.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- AB is a chord of the circle.
- CF is a chord of the circle.
- AB is congruent to DF.
- AB and CF are perpendicular to each other at point L.
- Diameter DE divides the circle into two equal halves.
- AB and CF are perpendicular diameters of the circle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = \(9x\)
- DF = \(9x\) (since AB â‰… DF)
- CF = \(2x + 14\)

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the value of \(x\).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the chords, their lengths, and the relationship between them.
