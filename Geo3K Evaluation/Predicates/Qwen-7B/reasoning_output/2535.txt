STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2535
================================================================================
QUESTION: Refer to the triangle shown below. Find y to the nearest tenth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
- Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are labeled.
- Line segment \( AB \) is labeled as 8 units.
- Line segment \( BC \) is labeled as 12.5 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex \( C \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( C \).
- Side \( AC \) is the hypotenuse.
- Sides \( AB \) and \( BC \) are perpendicular.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( AB = 8 \) units.
- \( BC = 12.5 \) units.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( y \), which represents the length of \( AC \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the right triangle, right angle, lengths of sides, and the relationship between the sides and the hypotenuse.
