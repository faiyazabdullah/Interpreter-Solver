STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2777
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find z.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with vertices \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
- Side \( AB \) is marked as \( 2\sqrt{3} \).
- Side \( BC \) is marked as \( \sqrt{3} \).
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex \( B \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( B \).
- Sides \( AB \) and \( BC \) are perpendicular.
- Side \( AC \) is the hypotenuse.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( AB = 2\sqrt{3} \) (given)
- \( BC = \sqrt{3} \) (given)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( AC \).
- To find \( AC \), we use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- We must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
