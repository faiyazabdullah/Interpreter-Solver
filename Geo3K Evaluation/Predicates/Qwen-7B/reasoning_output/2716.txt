STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2716
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- Side AB is marked as 66 units.
- Side AC is marked as \(x\).
- Side BC is marked as 33 units.
- There are no explicit right angle symbols or perpendicular markings.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is not a right triangle as there are no right angle symbols.
- No specific relationships like parallelism or perpendicularity are indicated.
- The lengths of sides AB, BC, and AC need to be used to find \(x\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 66 units (given)
- BC = 33 units (given)
- AC = \(x\) (variable we need to find)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of side AC (\(x\)).
- This requires using the properties of triangles, specifically the Pythagorean theorem if it's applicable.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle and its sides.
- We need to indicate the lengths of the known sides.
- We need to express the relationship between the sides to find \(x\).
