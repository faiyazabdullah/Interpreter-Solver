STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2606
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a trapezoid \(ABCD\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\).
- The top base \(CD\) is marked as \((x + 24)^\circ\).
- The bottom base \(AB\) is marked as \(115^\circ\).
- Angle \(A\) is marked as \((2y - 56)^\circ\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Trapezoid \(ABCD\) has one pair of parallel sides (\(AB \parallel CD\)).
- Angles at vertices \(A\) and \(B\) are given.
- The sum of the interior angles of a trapezoid is \(360^\circ\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle \(A = (2y - 56)^\circ\).
- Angle \(B = 115^\circ\).
- Angle \(C = (x + 24)^\circ\).
- Angle \(D\) is unknown but can be found using the sum of the angles in a trapezoid.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find \(x\).
- We need to use the properties of a trapezoid to determine the value of \(x\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the trapezoid, angles, and their relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
