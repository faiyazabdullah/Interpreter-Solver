STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2874
================================================================================
QUESTION: If P R \parallel K L, K N = 9, L N = 16, P M = 2 K P, find M N.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure with various shapes, lines, angles, and measurements.
- Points: P, Q, R, M, N, K, L, P, R, M, N, K, L.
- Lines: PQ, QR, RM, PM, MN, RN, NL, LM.
- Angles: Right angles at P, Q, and R.
- Measurements: KN = 9, LN = 16, PM = 2KP.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangles PQR, QNM, and LKN are formed.
- Triangles PQR, QNM, and LKN are right triangles since right angle symbols are present at P, Q, and R.
- PQR ∥ KLM due to the parallel lines PR and KL.
- PM = 2KP implies KP = PM/2.
- MN is a segment within triangle QMN.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- KN = 9.
- LN = 16.
- PM = 2KP.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for MN.
- Since triangles PQR and QNM are right triangles and PQR ∥ KLM, we can use the properties of similar triangles and the given lengths to find MN.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangles and their properties.
- Define the lengths and relationships.
