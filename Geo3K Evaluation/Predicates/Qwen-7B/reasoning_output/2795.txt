STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2795
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle Z.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral WXYZ with vertices labeled W, X, Y, Z.
- Angles at vertices W, X, Y, and Z are labeled with specific measures: \(a\), \(a-28^\circ\), \(a+2^\circ\), and \(\frac{1}{2}a + 8^\circ\) respectively.
- The quadrilateral appears to have some symmetry or specific angle relationships implied by the labels.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since the sum of interior angles in a quadrilateral is \(360^\circ\), we can set up an equation using the given angle measures.
- The angles sum to \(360^\circ\): 
  \[
  a + (a - 28^\circ) + (a + 2^\circ) + \left(\frac{1}{2}a + 8^\circ\right) = 360^\circ
  \]
- Simplify the equation to find \(a\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The angles are given as \(a\), \(a-28^\circ\), \(a+2^\circ\), and \(\frac{1}{2}a + 8^\circ\).
- We need to find the measure of \(\angle Z\), which is labeled as \(a + 2^\circ\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \(\angle Z\).
- To find \(\angle Z\), we need to solve the equation from the angle sum property of the quadrilateral.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the quadrilateral and its angles.
- We will use the relationship that the sum of the angles equals \(360^\circ\).
