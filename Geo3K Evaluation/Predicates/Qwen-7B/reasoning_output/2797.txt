STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2797
================================================================================
QUESTION: If R L = 5, R T = 9, and W S = 6, find R W.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle LRT with vertices L, R, T.
- Line RL is marked as 5 units long.
- Line RT is marked as 9 units long.
- Line WS is marked as 6 units long.
- Points W lies on line LS.
- There is no indication of right angles, parallelism, or specific geometric constraints in the diagram.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle LRT appears to be a non-right triangle.
- No parallel or perpendicular relationships are explicitly marked.
- No specific geometric properties such as right triangles, congruence, or similarity are indicated.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- RL = 5
- RT = 9
- WS = 6
- No other lengths or angles are provided.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of RW.
- Since RW is not directly given or calculated from the provided measurements, we cannot determine its length without additional information or assumptions about the triangle's properties.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle and the given lengths.
- We do not have enough information to determine RW directly.
