STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2920
================================================================================
QUESTION: For trapezoid Q R T U, V and S are midpoints of the legs. If Q R = 4 and U T = 16, find V S.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a trapezoid \(QR TU\).
- Points \(Q, R, T,\) and \(U\) are labeled.
- \(V\) and \(S\) are midpoints of legs \(QU\) and \(RT\) respectively.
- \(QR\) is parallel to \(UT\).
- \(QR = 4\) and \(UT = 16\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Trapezoid \(QRST\) with legs \(QR\) and \(UT\) parallel.
- Midpoints \(V\) and \(S\) divide \(QU\) and \(RT\) into equal segments.
- The relationship between midpoints implies that segment \(VS\) connects the midpoints of two non-parallel sides of a trapezoid.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(QR = 4\)
- \(UT = 16\)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- We need to find the length of \(VS\).
- In a trapezoid, the line segment connecting the midpoints of the non-parallel sides is half the sum of the lengths of the bases.
- Therefore, \(VS = \frac{QR + UT}{2}\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the trapezoid and its midpoints.
- Capture the parallel relationship.
- Calculate the length of \(VS\) using the given lengths.
