STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2488
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the scale factor from W to W'.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle \( \triangle W'WW \) with vertices labeled \( W', W, W \).
- Side \( WW' \) is marked as 8 units.
- Side \( WW \) is marked as 12 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex \( W \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \( \triangle W'WW \) is a right triangle with right angle at \( W \).
- Sides \( WW' \) and \( WW \) are perpendicular.
- Side \( WW' \) is the leg adjacent to the right angle.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( WW' = 8 \) units (given)
- \( WW = 12 \) units (given)
- The question asks for the scale factor from \( W \) to \( W' \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the scale factor from point \( W \) to point \( W' \).
- This requires determining how \( WW' \) compares to \( WW \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and the scale factor relationship.
