STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2503
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the shaded region.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with a central angle of 30°.
- Point E lies on the circumference of the circle.
- Point O is the center of the circle.
- Line segment OB is drawn from the center O to point B on the circumference.
- Line segment OE connects the center O to point E.
- The length of OE is given as 5 units.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- OB and OE are radii of the circle, so they are equal in length.
- OB = OE = 5 units.
- The angle BOE is 30°.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- OB = 5 units (given).
- OE = 5 units (given).
- ∠BOE = 30°.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the shaded region.
- The shaded region is a sector of the circle.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circle, radii, angle, and the sector.
