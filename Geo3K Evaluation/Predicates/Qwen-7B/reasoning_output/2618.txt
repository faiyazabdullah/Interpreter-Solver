STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2618
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, and C.
- Side AB is marked as \(x\).
- Side BC is marked as 4 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with a right angle at vertex B.
- Side AB is perpendicular to side BC.
- Side AC is the hypotenuse.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Side BC = 4 units (given).
- Side AB = \(x\) units (to be found).
- Side AC is the hypotenuse and its length needs to be determined.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of side AB (\(x\)).
- This requires using the Pythagorean theorem in the context of the right triangle ABC.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include the right angle at B and the lengths of sides BC and AB.
