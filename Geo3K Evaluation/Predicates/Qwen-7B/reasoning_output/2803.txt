STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2803
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x. Round to the nearest hundredth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AB is marked as \(x\)
- Side AC is marked as 24 units
- Angle B is labeled as 61°
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex C, indicating that AC is perpendicular to BC

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with the right angle at C
- Side BC is the base and AC is the hypotenuse
- Side AB is the leg opposite the right angle
- Angle B measures 61°, which means angle A measures 90° - 61° = 29°

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = \(x\) units
- AC = 24 units (hypotenuse)
- BC is the base of the right triangle
- We need to find the length of AB (\(x\))

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of AB (\(x\))
- This requires using trigonometric relationships in the right triangle

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties
