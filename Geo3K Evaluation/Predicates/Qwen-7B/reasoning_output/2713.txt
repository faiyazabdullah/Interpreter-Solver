STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2713
================================================================================
QUESTION: Use parallelogram A B C D to find m \angle C D F.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a parallelogram \(ABCD\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- Angles are marked as follows:
  - \(\angle BAC = 49^\circ\)
  - \(\angle BDA = 34^\circ\)
  - \(\angle BDC = 54^\circ\)
- Sides have lengths:
  - \(AB = 29\)
  - \(BC = 3y - 4\)
  - \(AD = CD = 25\)
- \(F\) is the intersection point where diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram, meaning opposite sides are equal and parallel.
- Therefore, \(AB \parallel CD\) and \(AD \parallel BC\).
- Diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) bisect each other.
- Since \(F\) is the intersection point of the diagonals, \(AF = FC\) and \(BF = FD\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(AB = 29\)
- \(AD = CD = 25\)
- \(BC = 3y - 4\)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the measure of \(\angle CDF\).
- Given the properties of the parallelogram and the angles involved, we need to use the properties of the parallelogram and the angles formed by the diagonals.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the parallelogram and its properties.
- Capture the given lengths and angles.
- Identify the relationship between the angles at the intersection point \(F\).
