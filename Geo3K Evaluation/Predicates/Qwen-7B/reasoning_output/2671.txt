STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2671
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find K L.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows two triangles labeled XYZ and JKL.
- Triangle XYZ has sides XY = 5, YZ = 15, and XZ = 15.
- Triangle JKL has sides JK = 4, KL = 4, and JL = 5.
- Both triangles have a common angle labeled as 51째 at vertex X and vertex J respectively.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle XYZ is isosceles because YZ = XZ.
- Triangle JKL is isosceles because JK = KL.
- Both triangles share the same angle measure of 51째.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- XY = 5
- YZ = 15
- XZ = 15
- JK = 4
- KL = 4
- JL = 5
- Angle XZY = 51째
- Angle JKL = 51째

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for KL.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent both triangles and their shared angle.
- Capture the lengths of the sides of both triangles.
