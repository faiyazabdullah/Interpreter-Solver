STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2682
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the parallelogram. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a parallelogram ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, and D.
- Side BC is marked as 12 cm.
- Side AD is marked as 20 cm.
- Angle ABC is marked as 60°.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCD is a parallelogram, implying opposite sides are equal and parallel.
- BC || AD and AB || CD.
- The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.
- Angle ABC = 60°.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of BC = 12 cm.
- Length of AD = 20 cm.
- Angle ABC = 60°.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the parallelogram.
- To find the area, we need the base and height of the parallelogram.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the parallelogram, its dimensions, and the formula for the area.
