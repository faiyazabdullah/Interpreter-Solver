STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2781
================================================================================
QUESTION: If A B C D is a rhombus, and m \angle A B C = 70, what is m \angle 1?

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a quadrilateral ABCD.
- Points A, B, C, and D are labeled.
- Line segments AB, BC, CD, and DA form the sides of the quadrilateral.
- Angles ∠ABC and ∠ADC are labeled.
- ∠ABC is marked as 70 degrees.
- ∠ADC is labeled as "1".
- The quadrilateral appears to be a rhombus since opposite angles are equal.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral ABCD is a rhombus.
- Opposite angles in a rhombus are equal.
- Therefore, ∠ADC = ∠ABC.
- Given ∠ABC = 70°, we have ∠ADC = 70°.
- ∠1 corresponds to ∠ADC.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- ∠ABC = 70° (given).
- ∠ADC = 70° (opposite angles in a rhombus).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of ∠1.
- Since ∠ADC = 70° and ∠1 corresponds to ∠ADC, ∠1 = 70°.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the rhombus, the angles, and the relationship between them.
