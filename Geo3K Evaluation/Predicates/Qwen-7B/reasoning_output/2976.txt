STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2976
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the measure of \angle 2.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a geometric figure with points A, B, C, D, E, and F.
- There are straight lines connecting these points.
- Angles are marked at various points, such as ∠CAB = 23°, ∠ADC = 32°, and ∠EBA = 22°.
- There is a right angle symbol at point F, indicating ∠CFB is a right angle (90°).

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ∠CFB is a right angle, so ∠CFB = 90°.
- ∠CAB = 23° and ∠ADC = 32° suggest that these angles are part of triangles or straight lines forming specific relationships.
- ∠EBA = 22° appears to be related to the straight line segment BE.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The angles ∠CAB, ∠ADC, and ∠EBA are explicitly labeled.
- ∠CFB is explicitly marked as a right angle.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of ∠2.
- Since no angle is explicitly labeled as ∠2, we need to determine which angle corresponds to it.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the angles and their measures.
- We will focus on the relationships between the angles and the straight lines.
