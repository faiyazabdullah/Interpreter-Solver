STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2553
================================================================================
QUESTION: In the figure, m \angle 11 = 62 and m \angle 14 = 38. Find the measure of \angle 1.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows two intersecting lines forming angles.
- There are labeled angles around the intersection point K.
- The angles are numbered from 1 to 14.
- Specific angles \( \angle 11 \) and \( \angle 14 \) are labeled with measures: \( \angle 11 = 62^\circ \) and \( \angle 14 = 38^\circ \).
- The angles form pairs of vertical angles and supplementary angles.
- There is no indication of parallel lines or specific geometric shapes beyond the angles formed at the intersection.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Vertical angles are equal (\(\angle 11 = \angle 12\) and \(\angle 14 = \angle 13\)).
- Supplementary angles sum up to \(180^\circ\) (\(\angle 1 + \angle 2 = 180^\circ\), \(\angle 3 + \angle 4 = 180^\circ\), etc.).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( m\angle 11 = 62^\circ \)
- \( m\angle 14 = 38^\circ \)

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \(\angle 1\).
- We need to use the relationship between angles at the intersection to find \(\angle 1\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the angles at the intersection.
- Capture the relationships between angles formed by the intersection.
- Ensure all given information is represented.
