STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2938
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the value of x in the diagram.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows a convex pentagon labeled A, B, C, D, E.
- Angles at vertices are labeled as follows:
  - ∠A = (x + 14)°
  - ∠B = 29°
  - ∠C = 42°
  - ∠D = 21°
  - ∠E = (x – 20)°
- The sum of interior angles of a pentagon is always 540°.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is 540°.
- We need to find the value of x using the given angle measures.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The angles at vertices are given as expressions involving x.
- The sum of the angles must equal 540°.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of x.
- We need to use the property that the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is 540°.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to express the sum of the angles and set it equal to 540°.
- We will then solve for x.
