STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2779
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a parallelogram WXYZ with vertices labeled W, X, Y, Z.
- Side WX is marked as \(x\) units.
- Side XY is marked as 10 units.
- Side WZ is marked as 16 units.
- Side ZY is marked as 20 units.
- There are no right angle symbols, parallel marks, or congruent marks visible in the diagram.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- WXYZ is a parallelogram.
- Opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal.
- Therefore, WX = YZ and XY = WZ.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- WX = \(x\)
- XY = 10 units
- WZ = 16 units
- ZY = 20 units

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \(x\).
- Since WXYZ is a parallelogram, WX must equal YZ.
- Therefore, \(x\) = ZY.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram and the equality of opposite sides.
