STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2911
================================================================================
QUESTION: If c = 5, find b.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with vertices labeled \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
- Side \( AB \) is marked as 5 units.
- Side \( BC \) is marked as 12 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex \( B \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at vertex \( B \).
- Sides \( AB \) and \( BC \) are perpendicular to each other.
- Side \( AC \) is the hypotenuse.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( AB = 5 \) units (given).
- \( BC = 12 \) units (given).
- \( AC \) is the length we need to find.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( AC \).
- This can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (\( AC \)) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (\( AB \) and \( BC \)).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
