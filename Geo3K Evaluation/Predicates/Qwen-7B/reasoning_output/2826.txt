STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2826
================================================================================
QUESTION: Quadrilateral W X Y Z is a rectangle. Find the measure of \angle 3 if m \angle 1 = 30.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rectangle WXYZ with vertices labeled W, X, Y, Z.
- Diagonals WX and YZ intersect at point O.
- Right angle symbols are marked at vertices W and Y.
- The following measurements are labeled: WX = 7, XY = 1, YZ = 2, and WZ = 3.
- Angles at intersection point O are labeled as 6, 9, 11, 12, 10, and 11.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral WXYZ is a rectangle.
- Right angles exist at vertices W and Y.
- Diagonals WX and YZ bisect each other at point O.
- Angles around point O form supplementary pairs, such as ∠9 + ∠10 = 180°.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- WX = 7
- XY = 1
- YZ = 2
- WZ = 3

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of ∠3.
- Given that m∠1 = 30°, we need to determine the relationship between angles at the intersection point O.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the rectangle, right angles, and the angles at the intersection point.
