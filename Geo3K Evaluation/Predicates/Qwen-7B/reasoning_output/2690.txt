STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2690
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- Lines \(AD\), \(DC\), \(CB\), and \(BA\) form the sides of the quadrilateral.
- Angles \(\angle A\), \(\angle B\), \(\angle C\), and \(\angle D\) are marked with right angle symbols, indicating that they are right angles.
- Sides \(AD\), \(DC\), \(CB\), and \(BA\) have numerical labels \(3x + 11\), \(5x - 8\), \(2y - 1\), and \(4y - 7\) respectively.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is composed of four right angles (\(\angle A\), \(\angle B\), \(\angle C\), and \(\angle D\)).
- The quadrilateral is a rectangle because it has four right angles.
- The lengths of opposite sides are equal: \(AD = CB\) and \(DC = AB\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Given lengths:
  - \(AD = 3x + 11\)
  - \(DC = 5x - 8\)
  - \(CB = 2y - 1\)
  - \(BA = 4y - 7\)

Since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, the opposite sides must be equal:
- \(AD = CB\)
- \(DC = BA\)

From these equations, we get:
\[ 3x + 11 = 2y - 1 \]
\[ 5x - 8 = 4y - 7 \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find \(x\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the quadrilateral as a rectangle and the relationships between the sides.
- We also need to use the equations derived from the equalities of the sides to solve for \(x\).
