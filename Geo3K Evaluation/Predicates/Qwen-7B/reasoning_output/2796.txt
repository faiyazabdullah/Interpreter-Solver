STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2796
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the measure of m \widehat Y X Z.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center point O.
- There are several points labeled A, B, X, Y, Z, W, V, and U.
- Angles are marked as 96° at A and 49° at W.
- Points A, Y, and B lie on the circle.
- Point Z lies on line segment AX.
- Point X lies on line segment AW.
- Line segments AX and AW intersect at point X.
- There are blue lines connecting various points indicating specific relationships.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Points A, Y, and B are concyclic because they lie on the same circle.
- Angles ∠AYB and ∠AXW are subtended by the same arc AB.
- Line segment AX intersects line segment AW at point X.
- Line segment AZ connects point Z to point A.
- Points Z and X lie on the same line segment AX.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The measure of ∠AYB is 96°.
- The measure of ∠AXW is 49°.
- The measure of ∠AYZ is to be found.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of ∠AYZ.
- To find this, we need to use the properties of angles subtended by the same arc.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circle, the angles, and the relationships between the points and lines.
