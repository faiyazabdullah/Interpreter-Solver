STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2702
================================================================================
QUESTION: In \triangle P Q R, Z Q = 3 a - 11, Z P = a + 5, P Y = 2 c - 1, Y R = 4 c - 11, m \angle P R Z = 4 b - 17, m \angle Z R Q = 3 b - 4, m \angle Q Y R = 7 b + 6, and m \angle P X R = 2 a + 10. If R Z is an angle bisector, find m \angle P R Z.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle \(PQR\) with point \(Z\) inside it.
- Points \(P\), \(Q\), \(R\), and \(Z\) are marked.
- Line segments \(ZQ\), \(ZP\), \(PY\), and \(YR\) are labeled with expressions involving variables \(a\), \(c\), and \(b\).
- Angles \(\angle PRZ\), \(\angle ZRQ\), \(\angle QYR\), and \(\angle PXR\) are labeled with expressions involving variables \(b\) and \(a\).
- \(ZR\) appears to be an angle bisector of \(\angle PRQ\).

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \(ZR\) bisects \(\angle PRQ\).
- Therefore, \(\angle PRZ = \angle ZRP\).
- Given \(\angle PRZ = 4b - 17\), we have \(\angle ZRP = 4b - 17\).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(ZQ = 3a - 11\)
- \(ZP = a + 5\)
- \(PY = 2c - 1\)
- \(YR = 4c - 11\)
- \(\angle PRZ = 4b - 17\)
- \(\angle ZRQ = 3b - 4\)
- \(\angle QYR = 7b + 6\)
- \(\angle PXR = 2a + 10\)

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \(\angle PRZ\).
- Since \(\angle PRZ = 4b - 17\) is already given, no further calculation is required from the provided information.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangle and its internal angles.
- Represent the lengths of the segments and the given angle measures.
