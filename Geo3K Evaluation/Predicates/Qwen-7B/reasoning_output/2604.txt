STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2604
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle with vertices labeled A, B, and C.
- Side AB is labeled as \(x\).
- Side BC is labeled as \(x - 3\).
- Side AC is labeled as 9 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with the right angle at vertex B.
- Sides AB and BC are perpendicular.
- Side AC is the hypotenuse.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Side BC is \(x - 3\).
- Side AC is 9 units.
- Side AB is \(x\) units.
- Since it is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the relationship between sides AB, BC, and AC.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \(x\).
- To solve for \(x\), we need to apply the Pythagorean theorem: \(AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2\).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships using the Pythagorean theorem.
