STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2674
================================================================================
QUESTION: In \odot F, m \angle D F A = 50 and C F \perp F B. Find m \widehat A C E.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle centered at point F with points A, B, C, D, E lying on it.
- There is a right angle symbol at point C, indicating that CF is perpendicular to FB.
- An angle ∠DAF is labeled as 50 degrees.
- The arc AC is labeled as ∠ACF.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The circle has center F and passes through points A, B, C, D, and E.
- CF is perpendicular to FB, making ∠CFB a right angle.
- ∠DAF = 50°, which implies that ∠DAF subtends arc DC.
- Since CF ⊥ FB, ∠CFB = 90°, and ∠DCF = ∠EFC = 45° because they are corresponding angles formed by the perpendicular lines.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- ∠DAF = 50°
- ∠CFB = 90°

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of arc ACE.
- Since ∠DAF = 50°, arc DC measures 100° (as the arc subtended by an inscribed angle is twice the angle).
- Arc AC and arc CE together form the semicircle minus arc DC.
- Therefore, arc ACE = 180° - 100° = 80°.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, the right angle, the angle ∠DAF, and the measure of arc ACE.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
