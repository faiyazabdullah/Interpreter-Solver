STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2766
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- Side AB is marked as 15 units.
- Side BC is marked as 16 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at B.
- Sides AB and BC are perpendicular.
- Side AC is the hypotenuse.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 15 units (given).
- BC = 16 units (given).
- AC length is what the question is asking for.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of AC.
- This requires using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
