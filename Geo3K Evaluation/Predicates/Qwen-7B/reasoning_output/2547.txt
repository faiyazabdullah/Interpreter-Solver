================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle \( \triangle QST \).
- Point \( T \) lies on segment \( QS \).
- Segments \( QT \) and \( TS \) are marked with lengths \( 2x \) and \( 17 \) inches respectively.
- Segment \( QS \) is marked with length \( 27 \) inches.
- Segment \( QT \) is marked with length \( 14 \) inches.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( \triangle QST \) is a triangle with point \( T \) on side \( QS \).
- Segment \( QT \) is congruent to segment \( TS \).
- Segments \( QT \) and \( TS \) form a segment \( QS \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of \( QT \): \( 2x \) inches.
- Length of \( TS \): \( 17 \) inches.
- Length of \( QS \): \( 27 \) inches.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the value of \( x \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, lengths, and the relationship between segments \( QT \) and \( TS \).
