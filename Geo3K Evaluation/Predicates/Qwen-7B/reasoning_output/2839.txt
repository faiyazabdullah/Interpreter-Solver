STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2839
================================================================================
QUESTION: The area A of the shaded region is given. Find x. A = 66 cm^2.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center \(K\).
- There is a vertical line segment \(JL\) passing through the center \(K\).
- The length of the vertical segment \(JL\) is marked as \(x \text{ cm}\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The vertical line segment \(JL\) passes through the center \(K\) of the circle.
- Since \(JL\) passes through the center, it is a diameter of the circle.
- The angle subtended by the diameter \(JL\) at the circumference is always \(180^\circ\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The length of the diameter \(JL\) is \(x \text{ cm}\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The area of the shaded region is given as \(66 \text{ cm}^2\).
- The question asks us to find the length \(x\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circle, the diameter, the angle subtended by the diameter, and the area of the shaded region.
