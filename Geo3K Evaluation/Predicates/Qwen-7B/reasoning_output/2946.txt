STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2946
================================================================================
QUESTION: If F G H J is a kite, find m \angle G F J.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a kite with vertices labeled \( F, G, H, J \).
- Angles at vertices \( F \) and \( G \) are marked as \( 128^\circ \) and \( 72^\circ \) respectively.
- The kite appears to have two pairs of adjacent sides that are equal in length.
- There are no additional markings indicating right angles or perpendicular lines.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure is identified as a kite due to the two pairs of adjacent equal sides.
- The sum of the interior angles of a kite is \( 360^\circ \). Given \( \angle FGH = 128^\circ \) and \( \angle FJG = 72^\circ \), the remaining angles \( \angle JGF \) and \( \angle JHF \) must be calculated.
- Since the kite's opposite angles are supplementary, we have:
  \[
  \angle JGF + \angle JHF = 360^\circ - (128^\circ + 72^\circ) = 160^\circ
  \]
  Given symmetry in kites, \( \angle JGF = \angle JHF = 80^\circ \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The angles are given as \( \angle FGH = 128^\circ \) and \( \angle FJG = 72^\circ \).
- No lengths are explicitly stated, but the kite's properties will determine the necessary relationships.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle GFJ \).
- Since \( \angle FJG = 72^\circ \) and \( \angle JGF = 80^\circ \), the measure of \( \angle GFJ \) can be found by considering the straight line property at point \( G \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- The kite structure and given angles need to be represented.
