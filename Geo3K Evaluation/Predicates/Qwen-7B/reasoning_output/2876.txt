STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2876
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the perimeter of \triangle D E F, if \triangle D E F \sim \triangle C B F, perimeter of \triangle C B F = 27, D F = 6, and F C = 8.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex \(D\).
- Line segments \(DE\) and \(DF\) are drawn within the quadrilateral.
- \(DF\) is marked as 6 units.
- \(FC\) is marked as 8 units.
- \(\triangle DEF\) is similar to \(\triangle CBF\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \(\triangle DEF \sim \triangle CBF\) implies corresponding angles are equal and corresponding sides are proportional.
- Since \(\triangle CBF\) is similar to \(\triangle DEF\), we have:
  - \(\angle EDF = \angle BCF\)
  - \(\angle DEF = \angle CFB\)
  - \(\angle EFD = \angle CBF\)
- The similarity ratio implies:
  - \(\frac{DE}{CF} = \frac{EF}{BF} = \frac{DF}{BC}\)

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(DF = 6\) units.
- \(FC = 8\) units.
- Perimeter of \(\triangle CBF = 27\) units.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the perimeter of \(\triangle DEF\).
- We need to find the lengths of \(DE\) and \(EF\) using the similarity ratio.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the quadrilateral, right angle, similarity, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
