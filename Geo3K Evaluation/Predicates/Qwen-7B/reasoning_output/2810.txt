STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2810
================================================================================
QUESTION: Quadrilateral A B D C is a rectangle. If m \angle 1 = 38, find m \angle 2.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a rectangle \(ABCD\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- Angles \(\angle 1\), \(\angle 2\), \(\angle 3\), \(\angle 4\), \(\angle 5\), \(\angle 6\), \(\angle 7\), and \(\angle 8\) are marked.
- The measurements given are:
  - \(\angle 1 = 38^\circ\)
  - \(\angle 2\) is adjacent to \(\angle 1\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \(ABCD\) is a rectangle.
- Opposite angles in a rectangle are equal.
- Adjacent angles form a straight line (180 degrees).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(\angle 1 = 38^\circ\)
- Since \(\angle 2\) is adjacent to \(\angle 1\), \(\angle 2 + \angle 1 = 180^\circ\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find \(\angle 2\).
- The relationship between \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 2\) needs to be determined.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the rectangle, angles, and their relationships.
