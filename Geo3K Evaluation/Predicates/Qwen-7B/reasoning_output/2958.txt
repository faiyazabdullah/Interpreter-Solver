STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2958
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find z.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle ABC with vertices A, B, and C.
- Side AB is marked as 6x.
- Side BC is marked as 36 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B, indicating that angle ABC is 90 degrees.
- Side AC is marked as z, which is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.
- Points X and Y are marked on sides AB and AC, respectively, suggesting perpendiculars from point B to these sides.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with a right angle at B.
- AB is perpendicular to BC.
- AB is 6x.
- BC is 36 units.
- AC is the hypotenuse z.
- AB and BC form a right angle at B.
- X and Y mark the intersection of the perpendiculars from B to AB and AC, respectively.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 6x (given).
- BC = 36 units (given).
- AC = z (hypotenuse of the right triangle).

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the value of z.
- To find z, we use the Pythagorean theorem: \( z = \sqrt{(6x)^2 + 36^2} \).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangle ABC.
- Represent the right angle at B.
- Represent the lengths of sides AB and BC.
- Represent the hypotenuse AC.
- Apply the Pythagorean theorem to find z.
