STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2978
================================================================================
QUESTION: In \odot P, m \angle M P L = 65 and N P \perp P L. Find m \widehat N M.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center \(P\).
- Points \(M\) and \(N\) lie on the circle.
- Point \(L\) lies on the circle and forms a right angle with \(P\).
- Angles \(MPN\) and \(MLN\) are formed.
- The measure of \(\angle MPL\) is given as 65 degrees.
- There is no indication of other specific measures or relationships involving other points or angles.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \(\angle MPL = 65^\circ\).
- \(NP \perp PL\).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(m \angle MPL = 65^\circ\).
- \(NP \perp PL\) implies that \(\angle NPL = 90^\circ\).

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- We need to find the measure of arc \(\widehat{NM}\).
- Since \(\angle MPL = 65^\circ\), we can infer that the central angle subtended by arc \(\widehat{NM}\) is twice the inscribed angle \(\angle MPN\) because the inscribed angle is half of the central angle subtended by the same arc.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle and its center.
- Represent the right angle and the given angle measure.
- Capture the relationship between the central angle and the inscribed angle.
