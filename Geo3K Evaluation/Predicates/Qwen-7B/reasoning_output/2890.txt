STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2890
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find P T.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle PQS with vertices labeled P, Q, S.
- Side PS is marked as 10 units.
- Side SQ is marked as 5 units.
- Side PQ is the hypotenuse.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex S.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle PQS is a right triangle with right angle at S.
- Sides PS and SQ are perpendicular.
- Side PQ is the hypotenuse.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- PS = 10 units (given)
- SQ = 5 units (given)
- PQ length is what the question is asking for.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of PQ.
- This requires using the geometric relationships visible in the triangle.
- The problem involves finding the hypotenuse of a right triangle.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
