STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2474
================================================================================
QUESTION: parallelogram M N P Q with m \angle M = 10 x and m \angle N = 20 x, find \angle M.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a parallelogram labeled \( MNPQ \).
- Points \( M, N, P, \) and \( Q \) are labeled.
- Angles at vertices \( M \) and \( N \) are marked.
- The angle at \( M \) is labeled as \( 10x \).
- The angle at \( N \) is labeled as \( 20x \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure represents a parallelogram with opposite angles equal.
- \( \angle M \) and \( \angle N \) are supplementary because they are adjacent angles in a parallelogram.
- Therefore, \( \angle M + \angle N = 180^\circ \).
- Given \( \angle M = 10x \) and \( \angle N = 20x \), we have \( 10x + 20x = 180^\circ \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- From the equation \( 10x + 20x = 180^\circ \), we can solve for \( x \).
- Simplifying, we get \( 30x = 180^\circ \).
- Solving for \( x \), we have \( x = \frac{180^\circ}{30} = 6^\circ \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- We need to find the measure of \( \angle M \).
- Given \( \angle M = 10x \), substituting \( x = 6^\circ \), we get \( \angle M = 10 \times 6^\circ = 60^\circ \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the parallelogram, angles, and the relationship between them.
- The angle at \( M \) is \( 10x \), and the angle at \( N \) is \( 20x \).
