STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2432
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the figure.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a rectangle ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D
- Side AD is marked as 9 inches
- Side AB is marked as 16 inches
- There are right angle symbols at vertices A, B, C, and D indicating right angles.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Rectangle ABCD has four right angles at vertices A, B, C, and D.
- Sides AB and BC are perpendicular to each other.
- Sides AD and AB are also perpendicular to each other.
- Sides AD and BC are parallel.
- Sides AB and CD are parallel.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AD = 9 inches (given)
- AB = 16 inches (given)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the rectangle.
- The formula for the area of a rectangle is \( \text{length} \times \text{width} \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the rectangle, right angles, measurements, and relationships.
