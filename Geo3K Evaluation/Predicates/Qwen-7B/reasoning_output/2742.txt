STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2742
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find y.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure with vertices A, B, C, and D.
- There are two triangles, ΔABC and ΔABD.
- Side AB is marked as 8.8 units.
- Side AC is marked as 8.5 units.
- Side CD is marked as x units.
- Side BD is marked as y units.
- Side AD is marked as z units.
- There are right angle symbols at points B and D.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangles ΔABC and ΔABD share side AB.
- Triangles ΔABC and ΔABD have a common vertex at A.
- Triangles ΔABC and ΔABD have a common side AB.
- There are right angles at vertices B and D.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 8.8 units (given)
- AC = 8.5 units (given)
- BD = y units (unknown)
- CD = x units (unknown)
- AD = z units (unknown)

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for y.
- To find y, we need to use the geometric properties of the triangles and the right angles.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangles, right angles, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
