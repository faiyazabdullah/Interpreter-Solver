STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2960
================================================================================
QUESTION: find \sin S.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle labeled \( \triangle SRT \) with vertices \( S \), \( T \), and \( R \).
- Side \( SR \) is marked as 5 units.
- Side \( RT \) is marked as 3 units.
- Side \( ST \) is marked as 4 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex \( T \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \( \triangle SRT \) is a right triangle with the right angle at vertex \( T \).
- Sides \( ST \) and \( RT \) form the legs of the triangle.
- Side \( SR \) is the hypotenuse.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( SR = 5 \) units (given)
- \( RT = 3 \) units (given)
- \( ST = 4 \) units (given)

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \( \sin S \).
- To find \( \sin S \), we need the opposite side relative to angle \( S \) and the hypotenuse.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
