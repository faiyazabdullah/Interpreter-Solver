================================================================================
QUESTION: If c = 5, find a.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
- Vertex \( A \) is at the right angle.
- Angle \( BAC = 30^\circ \).
- Angle \( ABC = 60^\circ \).
- Side \( BC \) is marked as \( a \).
- Side \( AB \) is marked as \( b \).
- Side \( AC \) is marked as \( c \).
- Given: \( c = 5 \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( C \).
- \( \angle BAC = 30^\circ \) and \( \angle ABC = 60^\circ \).
- \( BC = a \) and \( AB = b \).
- \( AC = c \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Given: \( c = 5 \).
- We need to find \( a \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( BC \) (denoted as \( a \)).
- This problem involves trigonometric relationships in a right triangle.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the right triangle.
- Capture the given side lengths.
- Use trigonometric relationships to find \( a \).
