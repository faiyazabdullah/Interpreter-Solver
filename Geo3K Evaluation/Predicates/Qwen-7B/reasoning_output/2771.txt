STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2771
================================================================================
QUESTION: Solve for x in the figure. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a trapezoid \(ABCD\) with vertices labeled \(A, B, C, D\).
- Side \(AD\) is marked as \(10x - 2\).
- Side \(BC\) is marked as \(6x + 4\).
- Side \(AB\) is marked as \(5x + 10\).
- Side \(CD\) is marked as \(5x + 10\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Trapezoid \(ABCD\) has two parallel sides (\(AB\) and \(CD\)).
- \(AB \parallel CD\).
- The lengths of the non-parallel sides are equal (\(AB = CD\)).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(AD = 10x - 2\).
- \(BC = 6x + 4\).
- \(AB = 5x + 10\).
- \(CD = 5x + 10\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the value of \(x\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the trapezoid, its parallel sides, and the equal non-parallel sides.
- We will use the relationship \(AB = CD\) to set up an equation for \(x\).
