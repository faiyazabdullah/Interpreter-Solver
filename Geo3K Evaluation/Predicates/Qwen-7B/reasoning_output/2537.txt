STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2537
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the measure of \angle A F B on \odot F with diameter A C.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center \( F \).
- Points \( A, B, C, D \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
- Angles \( \angle AFB \) and \( \angle CFD \) are marked.
- \( \angle AFB = 72^\circ \).
- \( \angle CFD = (4a - 1)^\circ \).
- \( \angle AFD = (2a - 5)^\circ \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Points \( A, B, C, D \) form a cyclic quadrilateral because they lie on the circumference of the circle.
- The sum of opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral is \( 180^\circ \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( \angle AFB = 72^\circ \).
- \( \angle CFD = (4a - 1)^\circ \).
- \( \angle AFD = (2a - 5)^\circ \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle AFB \).
- Since we already know \( \angle AFB = 72^\circ \), no further calculation is needed from the given information.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circle, the cyclic quadrilateral, and the marked angles.
- All visible geometric constraints and properties will be captured.
