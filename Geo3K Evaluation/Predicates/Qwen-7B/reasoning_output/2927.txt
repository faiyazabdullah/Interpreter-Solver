STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2927
================================================================================
QUESTION: The area of trapezoid J K L M is 138 square feet. The area of trapezoid Q R S T is 5.52 square feet. If trapezoid J K L M \sim trapezoid Q R S T, find the value of x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- There are two trapezoids labeled J K L M and Q R S T.
- Trapezoid J K L M has sides J K = 5 ft and is shaded blue.
- Trapezoid Q R S T is unshaded green.
- Trapezoid J K L M appears similar to trapezoid Q R S T.
- The area of trapezoid J K L M is given as 138 square feet.
- The area of trapezoid Q R S T is given as 5.52 square feet.
- The bases of trapezoid J K L M are not explicitly labeled, but one of them is J K = 5 ft.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Trapezoids J K L M and Q R S T are similar.
- The ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths.
- Since they are similar, the ratio of their areas is the same as the ratio of the squares of their corresponding side lengths.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The area of trapezoid J K L M is 138 square feet.
- The area of trapezoid Q R S T is 5.52 square feet.
- Let the length of base Q R of trapezoid Q R S T be \( x \).

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- We need to find the value of \( x \).
- Given that the areas of the similar trapezoids are proportional to the squares of their corresponding side lengths, we can set up the following proportion:
  \[
  \frac{\text{Area of } \triangle JKL}{\text{Area of } \triangle QRST} = \left(\frac{\text{Side length of } \triangle JKL}{\text{Side length of } \triangle QRST}\right)^2
  \]
- Here, the side length of trapezoid J K L M corresponding to the side length of trapezoid Q R S T is the base J K = 5 ft.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the areas of the trapezoids.
- Represent the similarity relationship between the trapezoids.
