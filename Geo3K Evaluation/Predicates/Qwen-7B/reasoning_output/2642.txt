STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2642
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary. Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a cyclic quadrilateral \(ABCD\) inscribed in a circle.
- Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) lie on the circumference of the circle.
- Segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) are tangent to the circle at points \(A\) and \(C\), respectively.
- \(AB = 5\) units.
- \(CD = 4\) units.
- \(AD = x + 8\) units.
- \(BC = x\) units.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since \(AB\) and \(CD\) are tangent to the circle at points \(A\) and \(C\) respectively, they are equal in length due to the tangent-tangent theorem.
- Therefore, \(AB = CD\).
- Given \(AB = 5\), it follows that \(CD = 5\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(AB = 5\)
- \(CD = 4\)
- \(AD = x + 8\)
- \(BC = x\)

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \(x\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the tangents, lengths, and the equation involving \(x\).
