STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2757
================================================================================
QUESTION: In the figure, m \angle 1 = 4 p + 15, m \angle 3 = 3 p - 10 and m \angle 4 = 6 r + 5. Find the value of p.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure with several triangles and lines.
- Angles are labeled as \( \angle 1 \), \( \angle 2 \), \( \angle 3 \), and \( \angle 4 \).
- The angles have specific expressions associated with them: \( m\angle 1 = 4p + 15 \), \( m\angle 3 = 3p - 10 \), and \( m\angle 4 = 6r + 5 \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure appears to involve multiple triangles, likely forming a larger geometric structure.
- The angles \( \angle 1 \), \( \angle 3 \), and \( \angle 4 \) suggest that they are part of a larger relationship involving summing up to specific values or being related through some geometric property.
- There are no explicit relationships like parallelism or perpendicularity indicated between lines in the immediate vicinity of the angles mentioned.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- There are no numerical measurements provided directly for lengths or angles other than the expressions for angles.
- The question asks for the value of \( p \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question seeks to find the value of \( p \) given the expressions for angles \( \angle 1 \), \( \angle 3 \), and \( \angle 4 \).
- These angles are likely parts of a larger geometric configuration where the sum of certain angles might equal specific values or follow trigonometric identities.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Given the nature of the question, we need to focus on the relationships between the angles and the expressions given.
