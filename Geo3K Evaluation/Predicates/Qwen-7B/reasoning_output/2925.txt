STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2925
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the figure.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rectangle with vertices labeled A, B, C, and D.
- Side AB is marked as 12 ft.
- Side AD is marked as 10 ft.
- All angles at vertices A, B, C, and D are right angles indicated by the square corner symbols.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure is a rectangle with four right angles.
- AB is parallel to CD.
- AD is parallel to BC.
- AB and CD are equal in length.
- AD and BC are equal in length.
- The diagonals AC and BD intersect at the center of the rectangle and are equal in length.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 12 ft (given)
- AD = 10 ft (given)
- The diagonals AC and BD have not been explicitly measured but can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the rectangle.
- The area of a rectangle is calculated as the product of its length and width.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the rectangle, right angles, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
