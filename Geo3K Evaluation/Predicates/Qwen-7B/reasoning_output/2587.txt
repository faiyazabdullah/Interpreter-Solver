STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2587
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the measure of \angle 2.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D.
- Angles are labeled as follows: ∠A = 47°, ∠B = 55°, ∠C = 57°.
- There are intersection points E where lines intersect forming angles 1, 2, and 3.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral ABCD has four angles at vertices A, B, C, and D.
- ∠A + ∠B + ∠C + ∠D = 360°.
- ∠A = 47°, ∠B = 55°, ∠C = 57°.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- ∠A = 47°
- ∠B = 55°
- ∠C = 57°

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of ∠2.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the angles and their measures.
