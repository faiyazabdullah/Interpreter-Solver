REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure with points A, C, and D connected by a straight line segment AD.
- Points B and C are connected to form a smaller line segment BC.
- At point C, two angles are formed: angle 1 and angle 2.
- Angle 1 and angle 2 are labeled and appear to be adjacent angles forming a linear pair.
- The measure of angle 2 is given as 67 degrees.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Angles 1 and 2 form a linear pair, meaning they are supplementary angles.
- Supplementary angles add up to 180 degrees.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The measure of angle 2 is given as 67 degrees.
- Since angle 1 and angle 2 form a linear pair, we can calculate angle 1 using the fact that supplementary angles sum up to 180 degrees.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle 1.
- The relationship between supplementary angles provides the necessary constraint to find angle 1.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the linear pair relationship and use the given measurement to find the measure of angle 1.
