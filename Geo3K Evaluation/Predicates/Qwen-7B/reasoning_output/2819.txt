STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2819
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the rhombus.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rhombus labeled as ABCD with vertices A, B, C, and D.
- The diagonals AC and BD intersect at point E.
- The length of diagonal AC is marked as 17 inches.
- The length of diagonal BD is marked as 8 inches.
- Diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular to each other.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular bisectors of each other.
- Since the diagonals intersect perpendicularly, they divide the rhombus into four right triangles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of diagonal AC = 17 inches.
- Length of diagonal BD = 8 inches.
- Diagonals AC and BD intersect at right angles, forming four right triangles.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the rhombus.
- The area of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula: \( \text{Area} = \frac{d_1 \times d_2}{2} \), where \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \) are the lengths of the diagonals.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the rhombus, its diagonals, and the relationship between them.
- Must include the lengths of the diagonals and the formula for calculating the area.
