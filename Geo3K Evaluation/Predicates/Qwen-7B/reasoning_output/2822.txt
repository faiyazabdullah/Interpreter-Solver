STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2822
================================================================================
QUESTION: For trapezoid T R S V, M and N are midpoints of the legs. If T R = 32 and M N = 25, find V S.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a trapezoid \( TRSV \).
- Points \( M \) and \( N \) are midpoints of the legs \( TV \) and \( RS \) respectively.
- \( TR = 32 \).
- \( MN = 25 \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( TRSV \) is a trapezoid with legs \( TV \) and \( RS \).
- \( M \) and \( N \) are midpoints of \( TV \) and \( RS \).
- \( MN \) is the midsegment of the trapezoid.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( TR = 32 \).
- \( MN = 25 \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( VS \).
- We need to use the properties of the midsegment of a trapezoid.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the trapezoid, midpoints, midsegment, and given lengths.
