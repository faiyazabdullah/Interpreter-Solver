STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2943
================================================================================
QUESTION: Use parallelogram A B C D to find m \angle A F D.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a parallelogram \(ABCD\) with vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- The sides \(AB\) and \(CD\) are parallel, as indicated by the double arrowheads.
- The sides \(AD\) and \(BC\) are also parallel.
- Angles \(A\) and \(D\) are given as \(49^\circ\) and \(34^\circ\) respectively.
- The angles at \(B\) and \(C\) are not explicitly labeled but can be determined from the given angles.
- The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at point \(F\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram, so opposite sides are equal and parallel.
- \(\angle A = 49^\circ\) and \(\angle D = 34^\circ\).
- Since \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram, \(\angle B = 180^\circ - \angle A = 131^\circ\) and \(\angle C = 180^\circ - \angle D = 146^\circ\).
- The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) bisect each other at point \(F\), so \(F\) is the midpoint of both diagonals.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- No numerical lengths are explicitly given for sides or diagonals in the diagram.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find \(m\angle AFD\).
- In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, meaning \(\angle AFD\) is half of \(\angle A\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, angles, and the relationship between the diagonals.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
