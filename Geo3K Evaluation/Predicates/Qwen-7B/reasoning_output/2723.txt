STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2723
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find z.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle RST with vertices labeled R, S, T.
- Side RS is marked as \(2z - 15\).
- Side RT is marked as 9.
- Side ST is marked as 7.
- There is no right angle symbol or other special markings indicated.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle RST has sides RS, RT, and ST.
- No special geometric relationships (like right angles, parallelism, etc.) are explicitly marked.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- RS = \(2z - 15\) (given)
- RT = 9 (given)
- ST = 7 (given)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \(z\).
- This requires solving for \(z\) using the given lengths of the sides of the triangle.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, its sides, and the measurement constraint involving \(z\).
