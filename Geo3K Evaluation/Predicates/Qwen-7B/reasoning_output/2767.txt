================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the value of x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with points A, B, C, D, and E.
- Points A and D lie on the circumference of the circle.
- Points B and E lie on the circle arc.
- Angles ∠ABE and ∠AEB are labeled as 65° and 132°, respectively.
- Point E is connected to points A, B, and D, forming a cyclic quadrilateral.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The points A, B, C, D, and E form a cyclic quadrilateral.
- Angles ∠ABE and ∠AEB are given as 65° and 132°, respectively.
- Since it's a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of opposite angles equals 180°.
- Therefore, ∠AED = 180° - 132° = 48°.
- ∠AEB = 132° is already given.
- ∠ABE = 65° is already given.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- ∠ABE = 65°
- ∠AEB = 132°
- ∠AED = 48°

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the value of x, which appears to be ∠AEB.
- We already know ∠AEB = 132° from the given information.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the points and angles explicitly.
- Use the given angle values directly.
