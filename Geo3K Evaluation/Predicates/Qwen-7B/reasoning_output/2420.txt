STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2420
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find D E.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- Side AB is marked as 45 units.
- Side BC is marked as 15 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B.
- I also see a smaller right triangle DEF with vertices labeled D, E, F.
- Side DE is marked as x units.
- Side EF is marked as 3 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex F.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at B.
- Sides AB and BC are perpendicular.
- Side AC is the hypotenuse of triangle ABC.
- Triangle DEF is a right triangle with right angle at F.
- Sides DE and EF are perpendicular.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 45 units (given).
- BC = 15 units (given).
- EF = 3 units (given).

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of DE.
- To find DE, we need to use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle DEF.
- We know the lengths of the sides EF and DF, so we can calculate DE.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangles, right angles, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
