STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2504
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x to the nearest hundredth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- Side AB is marked as \(x\).
- Side BC is marked as 15 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex C.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with the right angle at vertex C.
- Side BC is perpendicular to side AC.
- Side AB is the hypotenuse.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- BC = 15 units (given).
- AB = \(x\) (to find).

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the length of AB (\(x\)).
- This requires using the Pythagorean theorem, where \(AB^2 = BC^2 + AC^2\).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurement, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
