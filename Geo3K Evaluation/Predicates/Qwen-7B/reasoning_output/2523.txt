STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2523
================================================================================
QUESTION: The pair of polygons is similar. Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows two rectangles: one larger rectangle \(ABCD\) and a smaller rectangle \(EFGH\).
- The smaller rectangle \(EFGH\) is inside the larger rectangle \(ABCD\).
- Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) form the larger rectangle.
- Points \(E\), \(F\), \(G\), and \(H\) form the smaller rectangle.
- The coordinates and lengths are labeled: \(AB = x\), \(AD = x - 2\), \(BC = EF = 5\), and \(CD = FG = 7.5\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Both rectangles share the same width (\(BC = EF = 5\)).
- The height difference between the rectangles is \(2\) units (\(AD = x - 2\)).
- The length of the larger rectangle (\(AD\)) minus the length of the smaller rectangle (\(CD\)) equals the given width difference.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of \(AB = x\).
- Length of \(AD = x - 2\).
- Length of \(BC = EF = 5\).
- Length of \(CD = FG = 7.5\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the value of \(x\).
- The relationship between the lengths of the rectangles implies that \(x - 2 = 7.5\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the rectangles, their dimensions, and the relationship between them.
- Ensure all visible information and constraints are captured without solving the equation.
