STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2520
================================================================================
QUESTION: A B \perp D C and G H \perp F E. If \triangle A C D \sim \triangle G E F, find A B.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows two triangles, \( \triangle ACD \) and \( \triangle GEF \).
- Points \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H \) are labeled.
- \( AB \) is perpendicular to \( DC \) in \( \triangle ACD \).
- \( GH \) is perpendicular to \( FE \) in \( \triangle GEF \).
- \( AB \) is marked as 4.4.
- \( GH \) is marked as 3.15.
- \( AC \) is part of \( \triangle ACD \) and \( GF \) is part of \( \triangle GEF \).

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( AB \perp DC \) implies \( \angle ABD = 90^\circ \).
- \( GH \perp FE \) implies \( \angle GHF = 90^\circ \).
- Both triangles are right triangles.
- The triangles \( \triangle ACD \) and \( \triangle GEF \) are similar because they share the same angles due to the right angles and the similarity property.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( AB = 4.4 \).
- \( GH = 3.15 \).

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \( AB \).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangles and their right angles.
- Represent the similarity relationship.
- Capture the given lengths.
