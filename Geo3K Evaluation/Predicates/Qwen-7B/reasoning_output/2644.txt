STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2644
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find B C.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure with multiple shapes and lines.
- There are two triangles: $\triangle ABD$ and $\triangle BCE$.
- The triangles share point $E$.
- $ABDE$ forms a parallelogram.
- $BCDE$ forms a rectangle.
- $AB$ is marked as 12 units.
- $AD$ is marked as 5 units.
- $BC$ is marked as 12 units.
- $DE$ is marked as 5 units.
- There are no right angles or perpendicular lines explicitly marked.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- $\triangle ABD$ and $\triangle BCE$ are congruent because they share the same dimensions ($AB=BC=12$, $AD=DE=5$, and $BD=EC$).
- $ABDE$ forms a parallelogram due to the opposite sides being equal ($AB=DE=12$ and $AD=BE=5$).
- $BCDE$ forms a rectangle because the diagonals ($BD$ and $EC$) are equal and bisect each other.
- $\triangle ABD \cong \triangle BCE$ implies $\angle BAD = \angle BCE$ and $\angle ADB = \angle BEC$.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- $AB = 12$
- $AD = 5$
- $BC = 12$
- $DE = 5$

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of $BC$, which is already marked as 12 units.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangles, parallelogram, rectangle, and the relationships between the lengths and shapes.
- Since the question asks for the length of $BC$, we do not need to derive it but represent the given lengths and shapes.
