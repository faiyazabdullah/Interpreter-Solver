STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2775
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x so that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a parallelogram ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D
- Side AD is marked as \(5y\)
- Side BC is marked as \(2y + 12\)
- Side AB is marked as \(2x - 5\)
- Side CD is marked as \(3x - 18\)
- All sides are parallel and equal in pairs

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Parallelogram ABCD has opposite sides equal: \(AD = BC\) and \(AB = CD\)
- Parallelogram ABCD has opposite sides parallel: \(AD \parallel BC\) and \(AB \parallel CD\)
- Opposite angles are equal: \(\angle A = \angle C\) and \(\angle B = \angle D\)

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(AD = 5y\)
- \(BC = 2y + 12\)
- \(AB = 2x - 5\)
- \(CD = 3x - 18\)

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find \(x\) such that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram
- This requires setting the lengths of adjacent sides equal: \(2x - 5 = 3x - 18\)

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, its sides, and the equality condition
