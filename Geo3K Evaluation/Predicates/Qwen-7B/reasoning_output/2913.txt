STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2913
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral labeled \(ABCD\) with vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- The quadrilateral has diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\).
- Vertex \(C\) is marked with a right angle symbol.
- Sides \(AB\) and \(BC\) have lengths labeled as 14 and 10, respectively.
- The diagonal \(AC\) is labeled as \(x\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral \(ABCD\) contains a right angle at vertex \(C\).
- The right angle at \(C\) implies that \(ABC\) forms a right triangle.
- Since \(AC\) is the diagonal connecting \(A\) and \(C\) in quadrilateral \(ABCD\), it can also be considered part of the right triangle \(ABC\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of \(AB = 14\).
- Length of \(BC = 10\).
- Length of \(AC = x\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \(AC\) (\(x\)).
- To find \(x\), we need to use the Pythagorean theorem since \(\triangle ABC\) is a right triangle.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the right triangle \(ABC\).
- Define the lengths of the sides.
- Apply the Pythagorean theorem to find \(x\).
