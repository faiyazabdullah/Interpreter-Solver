STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2597
================================================================================
QUESTION: Equilateral pentagon P Q R S T is inscribed in \odot U. Find m \widehat Q R.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a regular pentagon \(PQRST\) inscribed in a circle centered at \(U\).
- Points \(P, Q, R, S, T\) lie on the circumference of the circle \(\odot U\).
- The pentagon is equilateral, meaning all sides are equal and all internal angles are equal.
- The circle's center is marked as \(U\).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The pentagon \(PQRST\) is equilateral and inscribed in \(\odot U\).
- Since it is a regular pentagon, each internal angle of the pentagon is \(108^\circ\).
- The central angles subtended by the arcs \(PQ, QR, RS, ST,\) and \(TP\) are each \(72^\circ\) because the total central angle around the circle is \(360^\circ\) divided by 5.
- The arc \(QR\) spans \(72^\circ\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- No specific numerical measurements are provided in the diagram apart from the fact that the pentagon is regular and inscribed in the circle.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the measure of the arc \(QR\).
- Since the pentagon is regular and inscribed in the circle, the arc \(QR\) corresponds to the central angle subtended by it.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the pentagon, its inscribed circle, the arc, and the relationship between the arc and the central angle.
