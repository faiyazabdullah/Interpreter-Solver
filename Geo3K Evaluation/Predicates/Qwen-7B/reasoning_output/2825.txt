STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2825
================================================================================
QUESTION: In \odot P, J K = 10 and \widehat J K L = 134. Find m \widehat J L.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle labeled as \(\odot P\).
- Points \(J\), \(K\), \(L\), \(M\), and \(P\) are marked within the circle.
- Segment \(JK\) is labeled with the length 10.
- Arc \(\widehat{JKL}\) is labeled with the measure \(134^\circ\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Point \(P\) is the center of the circle.
- \(P\) lies on segment \(JK\).
- Arc \(\widehat{JKL}\) subtends angle \(\angle JPL\).
- Arc \(\widehat{JK}\) subtends angle \(\angle JPK\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(JK = 10\).
- \(\widehat{JKL} = 134^\circ\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of arc \(\widehat{JL}\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, points, lengths, arcs, and relationships.
