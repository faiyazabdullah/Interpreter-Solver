STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2437
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle V X W.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center O.
- Points V, X, Y, Z, and W lie on the circle.
- Angles VXZ and VWX are given as (2x + 65)° and (4x + 15)° respectively.
- There are no right angle symbols, parallel marks, or congruent marks visible.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Points V, X, Y, Z, and W are on a circle centered at O.
- Angles VXZ and VWX are inscribed angles subtended by the same arc VZW.
- The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle subtended by the same arc.
- Since VXZ and VWX are inscribed angles subtended by the same arc VZW, they are equal.
- Therefore, we have the equation: (2x + 65)° = (4x + 15)°.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- We need to find x from the equation (2x + 65)° = (4x + 15)°.
- Subtracting (2x + 65) from both sides gives: 65 - 15 = 4x - 2x.
- Simplifying, we get: 50 = 2x.
- Solving for x, we get: x = 25.
- Substituting x back into either angle expression, we find the measure of angle VXZ and VWX.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle VXW.
- Since VXZ and VWX are equal and inscribed angles subtending the same arc, VXW is the supplement of VXZ and VWX combined.
- The measure of VXW is twice the measure of VXZ or VWX minus 180°.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, the angles, and the relationship between them.
- Must include the given angle measures and the relationship between inscribed angles.
