STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2953
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the measure of \angle 3.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with vertices labeled \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
- Angles at \( \angle A \) and \( \angle C \) are labeled as \( 70^\circ \) and \( 40^\circ \), respectively.
- The angle at \( \angle B \) is labeled as \( 45^\circ \).
- Side lengths are marked as follows:
  - \( AB = 2 \)
  - \( BC = 1 \)
  - \( AC = 3 \)
- There are no right angles or other special markings indicated in the diagram.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( \triangle ABC \) is a triangle with angles summing up to \( 180^\circ \).
- The angles at \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) form a triangle where:
  - \( \angle A + \angle B + \angle C = 180^\circ \).
- Given angles:
  - \( \angle A = 70^\circ \)
  - \( \angle B = 45^\circ \)
  - \( \angle C = 40^\circ \)
- These angles do not imply any special properties like a right triangle.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Side lengths:
  - \( AB = 2 \)
  - \( BC = 1 \)
  - \( AC = 3 \)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the measure of \( \angle 3 \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- The goal is to represent the triangle and its angles.
- Since there are no additional geometric properties or relationships beyond the angles provided, the focus will be on capturing the given angles and side lengths.
