STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2542
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the scale factor from Q to Q'.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a parallelogram \(ABCD\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- There is a smaller parallelogram \(PQ'Q\) inside \(ABCD\).
- Point \(X\) is marked within the larger parallelogram.
- \(Q'\) and \(Q\) are connected, forming part of the larger parallelogram.
- The distance \(QC\) is labeled as 5 units.
- The total length \(QC'\) is labeled as 15 units.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The smaller parallelogram \(PQ'Q\) appears to be similar to the larger parallelogram \(ABCD\).
- \(Q'\) lies on the extension of \(BC\) beyond point \(C\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(QC = 5\) units.
- \(QC' = 15\) units.
- The scale factor from \(Q\) to \(Q'\) is the ratio of the lengths \(QC'\) to \(QC\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the scale factor from \(Q\) to \(Q'\).
- To find the scale factor, divide the length \(QC'\) by the length \(QC\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelograms and the relationship between the lengths \(QC'\) and \(QC\).
