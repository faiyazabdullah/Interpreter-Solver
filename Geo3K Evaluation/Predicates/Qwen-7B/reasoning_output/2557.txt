STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2557
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center \( B \).
- There are two arcs labeled \( 3x^\circ \) and \( (5x - 12)^\circ \).
- These arcs are parts of a circle with center \( B \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The sum of the measures of the arcs forming a full circle is \( 360^\circ \).
- Therefore, the relationship between the arcs is: 
  \[
  3x + (5x - 12) = 360
  \]

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- From the equation \( 3x + (5x - 12) = 360 \), we need to solve for \( x \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the value of \( x \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the arc relationships and the equation to solve for \( x \).
