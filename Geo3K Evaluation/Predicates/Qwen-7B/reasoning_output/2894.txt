STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2894
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the perimeter of the parallelogram.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a parallelogram \(ABCD\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- Side \(AD\) is marked as 16 ft.
- Side \(DC\) is marked as 23 ft.
- Angle \(D\) is labeled as \(60^\circ\).
- There is a right angle symbol at point \(E\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram.
- \(AD \parallel BC\) and \(AB \parallel DC\).
- \(AD = BC\) and \(AB = DC\).
- Since \(AD\) is given as 16 ft and \(BC\) as 23 ft, there seems to be a discrepancy in the given measurements.
- There is a right angle at point \(E\), indicating a perpendicular relationship at point \(E\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(AD = 16\) ft.
- \(DC = 23\) ft.
- Angle \(D = 60^\circ\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the perimeter of the parallelogram.
- The perimeter of a parallelogram is given by the formula: \(P = 2 \times (AD + DC)\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the parallelogram and its sides, as well as the given lengths and the right angle at point \(E\).
- We also need to ensure we correctly capture the right angle relationship at point \(E\).
