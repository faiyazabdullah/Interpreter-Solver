STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2561
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the figure. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, and D.
- Side AB is marked as 4 meters.
- Side AD is marked as 6 meters.
- Side CD is marked as 5 meters.
- Angle BAD is a right angle (indicated by a square symbol).
- Side BC is marked as 4 meters.
- Angles ABC and ADC are right angles (indicated by square symbols).

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral ABCD is composed of two right triangles, ABD and BCD.
- Triangles ABD and BCD are right triangles with right angles at B and D respectively.
- AB = BD = 4 meters (ABD is a right triangle).
- AD = BC = 6 meters (BCD is a right triangle).
- CD = 5 meters.
- Angles ABC and ADC are right angles.
- Triangles ABD and BCD are congruent because they share side BC and have equal legs (AB = BD).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 4 meters.
- AD = 6 meters.
- CD = 5 meters.
- BC = 4 meters.
- Right angles at B and D imply that AB is perpendicular to BD and AD is perpendicular to CD.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the quadrilateral ABCD.
- To find the area, we need to calculate the areas of triangles ABD and BCD separately and then sum them up.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the right angles, lengths, and relationships between the triangles.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
