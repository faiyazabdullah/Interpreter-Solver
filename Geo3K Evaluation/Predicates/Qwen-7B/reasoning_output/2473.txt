STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2473
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with point \(D\) inside it.
- Angles \(\angle ADB\), \(\angle BDC\), and \(\angle CDA\) are marked.
- Sides \(AD\), \(BD\), \(CD\), \(BC\), \(AC\) are labeled.
- \(AD\) is labeled as \(6x + 2\).
- \(BD\) is labeled as \(8\).
- \(CD\) is labeled as \(10\).
- \(AC\) is labeled as \(9x - 2\).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is not necessarily a specific type (e.g., parallelogram, rectangle, etc.).
- No angles or sides are explicitly stated as parallel, perpendicular, or congruent.
- There are no right angles or specific symmetry properties indicated.
- The lengths \(AD = 6x + 2\), \(BD = 8\), \(CD = 10\), and \(AC = 9x - 2\) suggest some algebraic relationship involving \(x\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(AD = 6x + 2\)
- \(BD = 8\)
- \(CD = 10\)
- \(AC = 9x - 2\)

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \(x\).
- To find \(x\), we need to use the given lengths and possibly the properties of the quadrilateral or triangles formed within it.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the lengths and their algebraic relationships.
- We will use the lengths directly without solving for \(x\).
