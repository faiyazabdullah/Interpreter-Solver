STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2460
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x. Round the angle measure to the nearest degree.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle \(ABC\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\).
- Side lengths \(AB = 29\), \(BC = 50\), and \(AC = 61\) are marked.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex \(B\).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \(ABC\) is a right triangle with the right angle at \(B\).
- \(AB\) and \(BC\) are perpendicular.
- \(AC\) is the hypotenuse.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of \(AB = 29\).
- Length of \(BC = 50\).
- Length of \(AC = 61\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \(x\), which represents the angle \( \angle B \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and the angle \(x\).
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
