STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2596
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle JKL with vertices labeled J, K, L.
- Side JK is marked as \(3x + 6\).
- Side KL is marked as \(4x\).
- Side JL is marked as \(5x - 6\).

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle JKL is a triangle with sides JK, KL, and JL.
- No specific geometric relationships like right angles, parallelism, or congruence are marked.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- JK = \(3x + 6\)
- KL = \(4x\)
- JL = \(5x - 6\)

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the value of \(x\).
- The problem involves solving for \(x\) using the given side lengths.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, side lengths, and the equation resulting from equating the expressions involving \(x\).
