STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2987
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find B C.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
- Vertex \( A \) lies on a circle centered at \( K \).
- Vertex \( B \) is at the center of the circle.
- Vertex \( C \) is on the circle.
- \( \angle ABC \) is a right angle (\( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \)).
- Side \( AB \) is marked as 5 units.
- Side \( BC \) is marked as \( x \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( B \).
- \( AB \) is a radius of the circle centered at \( K \).
- \( AB \) is perpendicular to \( BC \).
- \( AB \) and \( BC \) form the legs of the right triangle.
- \( AC \) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( AB = 5 \) units (given).
- \( BC = x \) units (variable).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( BC \).
- We need to use the Pythagorean theorem to find \( BC \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the right triangle, right angle, lengths, and the relationship between the sides using the Pythagorean theorem.
