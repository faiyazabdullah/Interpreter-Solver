STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2495
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find z.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- Points \(B\) and \(C\) form a right angle (\(\angle B = 90^\circ\)).
- The lengths of sides \(BC\) and \(BD\) are given as 8 units and 6 units, respectively.
- The quadrilateral appears to have a specific shape or property, but no explicit geometric shape like a rectangle or parallelogram is explicitly stated.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \(\angle B\) is a right angle (\(\angle B = 90^\circ\)).
- \(BC\) and \(BD\) form a right angle at \(B\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(BC = 8\) units (given).
- \(BD = 6\) units (given).
- \(AD\) and \(DC\) are not explicitly given.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question does not specify what needs to be found. Given the right angle at \(B\), it could be asking for the length of \(AD\) or \(DC\), or some other geometric property related to the quadrilateral.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the right angle at \(B\).
- Capture the lengths of \(BC\) and \(BD\).
- Ensure all necessary geometric relationships are represented.
