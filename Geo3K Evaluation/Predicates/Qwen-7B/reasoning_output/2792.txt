STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2792
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the measure of \angle 3 if m \angle 4 = m \angle 5.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a geometric figure with multiple triangles and points.
- Triangles ABE, ABD, ACD, and AEF are labeled.
- Angles and sides are marked with specific values and symbols.
- Points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H are labeled.
- Triangles ABE, ABD, and ACD are part of larger figures, possibly parallelograms or quadrilaterals.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABE has an angle of 63° at vertex E.
- Triangle ABD has an angle of 47° at vertex E.
- Triangle ACD has an angle of 136° at vertex A.
- Triangle AEF has an angle of 69° at vertex E.
- Lines are connected at point E forming angles.
- Triangles ABE and AEF share vertex E.
- Triangles ABD and ACD share vertex A.
- Lines BE, BD, CD, EF, and AD are segments within the figure.
- Line AG is a straight line extending through point G.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle AEB = 63°.
- Angle AED = 69°.
- Angle BAD = 47°.
- Angle CAD = 136°.
- Side lengths are given as follows:
  - AE = 2 units.
  - BE = 5 units.
  - ED = 7 units.
  - FD = 6 units.
  - DG = 6 units.
  - Angle 1 = 69°.
  - Angle 2 = 63°.
  - Angle 3 = ?
  - Angle 4 = 69°.
  - Angle 5 = ?

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the measure of ∠3 given that ∠4 = ∠5.
- Since ∠4 and ∠5 are equal, we need to use the given angles to deduce ∠3.
- The sum of angles around point E is 360°.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the angles and their relationships.
- Must include the given angles and the constraint ∠4 = ∠5.
