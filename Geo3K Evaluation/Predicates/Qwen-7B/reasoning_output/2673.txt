STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2673
================================================================================
QUESTION: In \odot R, find T V. Round to the nearest hundredth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle centered at point R.
- Points U, S, T, R, and V are marked inside the circle.
- Line segment UT is perpendicular to RS.
- Line segment RS has lengths marked as 5 and 6 units.
- Right angle symbol indicates UT is perpendicular to RS.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Line segment UT is perpendicular to line segment RS.
- Line segment UT intersects line segment RS perpendicularly.
- The length of RS is split into two segments, one being 5 units and the other being 6 units.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- RS = 5 + 6 = 11 units.
- No specific length for UV is given.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for TV.
- Since there is no direct measurement for TV and it's part of the same circle, we need to use the properties of the circle and the given lengths.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circle, perpendicular relationship, and the lengths of the segments.
- The goal is to find TV, which depends on the lengths provided and the properties of the circle.
