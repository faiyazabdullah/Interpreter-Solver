STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2668
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find y.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABD with vertices labeled A, B, D
- Side AD is marked as 47 degrees
- Side BD is marked as 55 degrees
- Side AB is marked as 12 units
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABD is a right triangle with right angle at B
- Sides AD and BD form the legs of the triangle
- Side AB is the hypotenuse

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 12 units (given)
- AD = 47 degrees (given)
- BD = 55 degrees (given)

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of BD
- This requires using the geometric relationships visible in the triangle
- The problem involves finding the length of one of the legs of a right triangle

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties
