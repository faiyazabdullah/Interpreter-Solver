STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2541
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle A of quadrilateral A B C D.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- Angle \(A\) is labeled as \(3x^\circ\).
- Angle \(D\) is labeled as \(x^\circ\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The quadrilateral \(ABCD\) appears to be a rectangle because there are right angles at \(B\) and \(C\).
- Therefore, all angles in the quadrilateral sum up to \(360^\circ\).
- Since \(B\) and \(C\) are right angles (\(90^\circ\) each), the sum of the remaining angles \(A\) and \(D\) must be \(180^\circ\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- No numerical values are explicitly given for the angles or sides of the quadrilateral.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle \(A\).
- Given that the sum of angles \(A\) and \(D\) in the quadrilateral is \(180^\circ\), we can determine the measure of angle \(A\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the quadrilateral, the right angles, and the relationship between the angles \(A\) and \(D\).
