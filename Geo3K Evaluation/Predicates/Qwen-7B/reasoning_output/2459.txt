STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2459
================================================================================
QUESTION: J K L M is a rectangle. M L P R is a rhombus. \angle J M K \cong \angle R M P, m \angle J M K = 55, and m \angle M R P = 70. Find m \angle K L P.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows a rectangle JKLM and a rhombus MLPR.
- Points J, K, L, M, P, R are labeled.
- Angles JMK and RPM are marked as 55° and 70° respectively.
- No right angle symbols, parallel lines, or perpendicular markings are indicated.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- JKLM is a rectangle.
- MLPR is a rhombus.
- ∠JMK ≅ ∠RMP.
- ∠JMK = 55°.
- ∠RMP = 70°.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- ∠JMK = 55°.
- ∠RMP = 70°.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- We need to find the measure of ∠KLP.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the rectangle and rhombus.
- Capture the given angles and their relationships.
