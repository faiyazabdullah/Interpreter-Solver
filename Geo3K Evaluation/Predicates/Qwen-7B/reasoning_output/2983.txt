STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2983
================================================================================
QUESTION: Cut four congruent triangles off the corners of a rectangle to make an octagon. What is the area of the octagon?

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rectangle with vertices labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.
- The dimensions of the rectangle are given as AB = 30 cm and BC = 20 cm.
- Four congruent triangles are cut off from the corners of the rectangle to form an octagon.
- The right angles are marked at the vertices of the rectangle, indicating that the cuts form right triangles.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The rectangle has four right angles at A, B, C, and D.
- Triangles ABC, ABD, CDE, and DEF are right triangles.
- The triangles are congruent because they are formed by cutting off equal segments from the corners of the rectangle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 30 cm
- BC = 20 cm
- The lengths of the segments cut off from the corners are 6 cm each.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the resulting octagon after cutting off the four congruent right triangles.
- The area of the octagon will be the area of the rectangle minus the total area of the four triangles.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the rectangle and its dimensions.
- Represent the four congruent right triangles and their areas.
- Subtract the total area of the four triangles from the area of the rectangle to find the area of the octagon.
