STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2973
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find A B.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows two triangles: Triangle ABC and Triangle DEF.
- Triangle ABC has vertices A, B, and C.
- Triangle DEF has vertices D, E, and F.
- In Triangle ABC, side BC is marked as 5 units long.
- In Triangle DEF, side DF is marked as \(x-4\) units long.
- Both triangles appear to share similar angles, suggesting they might be similar triangles.
- No right angles or perpendicular markings are explicitly shown in the diagram.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangles ABC and DEF appear to be similar because they share identical angle measures.
- Since the triangles are similar, corresponding sides are proportional.
- The ratio of corresponding sides will be the same.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Side BC of Triangle ABC is 5 units.
- Side DF of Triangle DEF is \(x-4\) units.
- We need to find the length of AB in Triangle ABC.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the length of AB in Triangle ABC.
- Given the similarity, we can set up a proportion using the corresponding sides.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the similarity relationship between the triangles.
- We also need to capture the lengths of the sides involved in the similarity ratio.
