STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2649
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle \(ABC\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\).
- Side \(AB\) is marked as \(24\) units.
- Side \(BC\) is marked as \(x\) units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex \(B\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \(ABC\) is a right triangle with a right angle at vertex \(B\).
- Sides \(AB\) and \(BC\) are perpendicular.
- Side \(AC\) is the hypotenuse.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(AB = 24\) units (given).
- \(BC = x\) units (variable to find).
- \(AC\) length is the hypotenuse we need to determine.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \(AC\).
- This requires using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
