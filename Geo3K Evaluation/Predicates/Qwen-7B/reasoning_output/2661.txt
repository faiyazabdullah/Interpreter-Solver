STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2661
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the measure of the altitude drawn to the hypotenuse.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with vertices labeled \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
- Side \( AB \) is marked as 24 units.
- Side \( BC \) is marked as 14 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex \( C \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with right angle at vertex \( C \).
- Sides \( AB \) and \( AC \) are perpendicular.
- Side \( BC \) is the hypotenuse.
- \( CD \) is the altitude drawn to the hypotenuse \( AB \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( AB = 24 \) units (given).
- \( BC = 14 \) units (given).
- We need to find the length of the altitude \( CD \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of the altitude drawn to the hypotenuse \( AB \).
- This requires using the geometric relationships in the right triangle and the properties of the altitude.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, altitude, and its relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
