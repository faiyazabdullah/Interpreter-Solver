STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2683
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find P Q.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure with triangles and quadrilaterals.
- Triangles PQR and PSR are labeled.
- Points P, Q, R, T, S, and U are marked.
- Triangles PQR and PSR share point Q.
- Lines PQ, QR, RS, and SP are connected.
- Angles and lengths are marked, including segments PQ = 6 - x, QR = 3, RS = 6 + x, and SP = 3 + x.
- Right angle symbols are present at angles PQT and RQS.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangles PQR and PSR share point Q.
- Segments PQ, QR, RS, and SP are part of the triangles.
- Right angles at PQT and RQS imply perpendicular relationships between certain lines.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- PQ = 6 - x
- QR = 3
- RS = 6 + x
- SP = 3 + x

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for PQ.
- PQ is one of the segments in triangle PQR.
- We need to express PQ in terms of the given lengths.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangles, lengths, and right angles.
- The relationships between segments PQ, QR, RS, and SP are critical.
