STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2447
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the value of the variable y in the figure.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a pentagon labeled A, B, C, D, E.
- Angles are labeled as (3x - 70)°, (3y + 40)°, and 120°.
- No right angles, parallel lines, or congruent markings are indicated.
- The pentagon has no specific shape constraints like a rectangle, parallelogram, or rhombus.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The pentagon has five sides and five angles.
- The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is (5-2) * 180° = 540°.
- The angles (3x - 70)°, (3y + 40)°, and 120° are part of the total sum of the interior angles.
- The remaining two angles are not explicitly labeled but are implied by the sum of the angles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The angles (3x - 70)° and (3y + 40)° are expressed algebraically.
- The third angle is explicitly given as 120°.
- The sum of the angles in a pentagon is 540°.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of y.
- We need to find a relationship involving y that will help us determine its value.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the pentagon and its angles.
- The angles must satisfy the condition that their sum equals 540°.
