STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2758
================================================================================
QUESTION: Trapezoid G H J K has an area of 75 square meters. Find the height.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a trapezoid GHJK with vertices labeled G, H, J, K.
- Side GH is marked as 17 meters.
- Side JK is marked as 13 meters.
- There is no indication of right angles, parallelism, or congruence.
- The area of the trapezoid is given as 75 square meters.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Trapezoid GHJK is a quadrilateral with two sides parallel.
- GH || JK.
- No specific relationship like congruence or perpendicularity is indicated.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- GH = 17 meters.
- JK = 13 meters.
- Area = 75 square meters.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the height of the trapezoid.
- The formula for the area of a trapezoid is \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{Base}_1 + \text{Base}_2) \times \text{Height} \).
- Here, Base1 = GH, Base2 = JK, and the area is given as 75.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the trapezoid and its area formula.
- Must include the given lengths and the area.
