STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2892
================================================================================
QUESTION: in \triangle X Y Z, P is the centroid, K P = 3, and X J = 8. Find Y J.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle XYZ with vertices labeled X, Y, Z.
- Point P is marked inside the triangle, and it is labeled as the centroid.
- Line segments PX, PY, and PZ are drawn.
- PX is labeled as 8 units.
- KP is labeled as 3 units.
- No right angles, parallel lines, or other specific markings are visible.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Point P is the centroid of triangle XYZ.
- Line segments PX, PY, and PZ are medians of triangle XYZ.
- The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- PX = 8 units.
- KP = 3 units.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find YJ, where J is the point on segment XZ such that PX = XJ.
- Since P is the centroid, PX = 2 * KP.
- Given PX = 8, we have 8 = 2 * KP, which implies KP = 4.
- Since KP = 3, there seems to be a contradiction unless J is not the midpoint of XZ, implying J is a point on XZ closer to X than Z.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, centroid, lengths, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
