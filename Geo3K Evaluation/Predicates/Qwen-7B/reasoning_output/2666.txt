STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2666
================================================================================
QUESTION: E B \parallel D C. Find A B.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows a parallelogram \(ABCD\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- Line segment \(AB\) is marked as having a length of 5 units.
- Line segment \(DC\) is marked as having a length of 10 units.
- Line segment \(AD\) is marked as having a length of 4 units.
- Line segment \(BC\) is marked as having a length of 5 units.
- Line segment \(AB\) is parallel to line segment \(DC\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \(AB \parallel DC\).
- \(AB = BC = 5\) units.
- \(AD = DC = 10\) units.
- \(AD\) is marked as 4 units, which seems inconsistent with the other lengths unless it's part of another relationship or a different shape.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(AB = 5\) units.
- \(DC = 10\) units.
- \(AD = 4\) units.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \(AB\).
- Since \(AB\) is already given as 5 units, no further calculation is required.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, parallel lines, and the given lengths.
