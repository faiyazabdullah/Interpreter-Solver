STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2730
================================================================================
QUESTION: Each pair of polygons is similar. Find G F.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image contains two triangles labeled \( \triangle RST \) and \( \triangle EFG \).
- Triangle \( \triangle RST \) has vertices \( R, S, T \) with lengths \( RS = 20.7 \), \( RT = 15 \), and \( ST = 10 \).
- Triangle \( \triangle EFG \) has vertices \( E, F, G \) with lengths \( EF = 11.25 \), \( EG = x \), and \( FG = ? \).
- Angles \( \angle R = 27^\circ \), \( \angle T = 110^\circ \), and \( \angle S = 43^\circ \) are labeled.
- Angles \( \angle E = 27^\circ \) and \( \angle F = 110^\circ \) are labeled.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Both triangles are labeled as having the same angle measures \( 27^\circ \) and \( 110^\circ \).
- Since the sum of angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \), the third angle in both triangles must be \( 43^\circ \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Lengths \( RS = 20.7 \), \( RT = 15 \), and \( ST = 10 \).
- Length \( EF = 11.25 \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( FG \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangles and their sides.
- Represent the angles and their measures.
