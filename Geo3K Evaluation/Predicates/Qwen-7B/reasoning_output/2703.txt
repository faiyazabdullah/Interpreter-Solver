STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2703
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, and C.
- Side AB is marked as 10 units.
- Side BC is marked as 14 units.
- Side AC is marked as 18 units.
- There is no right angle symbol or perpendicular mark visible between any sides.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC appears to be scalene since none of the sides are marked as congruent.
- There are no apparent right angles, perpendicular lines, or parallel lines indicated in the diagram.
- The lengths of the sides are given: AB = 10, BC = 14, and AC = 18.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 10 units (given).
- BC = 14 units (given).
- AC = 18 units (given).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of x, which seems to be the length of segment AC.
- Since all three sides of the triangle are given, we need to ensure that the given lengths satisfy the triangle inequality theorem to confirm if they form a valid triangle.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle and its sides.
- We need to ensure the lengths given form a valid triangle.
