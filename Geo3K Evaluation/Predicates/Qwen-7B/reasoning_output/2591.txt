STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2591
================================================================================
QUESTION: A regular pentagon and a square share a mutual vertex X. The sides X Y and X Z are sides of a third regular polygon with a vertex at X. How many sides does this polygon have?

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a regular pentagon \(ABCDE\) with vertices \(A, B, C, D,\) and \(E\).
- There is a square \(XYZC\) where vertices \(X, Y, Z,\) and \(C\) are shared.
- The sides \(XY\) and \(XZ\) are part of the square.
- The pentagon and square share vertex \(X\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The square \(XYZC\) has four equal sides and four right angles.
- The pentagon \(ABCDE\) has five equal sides and five equal internal angles.
- Vertex \(X\) is common to both the square and the pentagon.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- No specific numerical values are provided for the lengths of sides or angles in the diagram.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks how many sides the polygon formed by connecting points \(A, B, C, D,\) and \(E\) has.
- Since the pentagon already has five sides, adding the square's sides does not change the total count.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the pentagon and the square.
- Ensure the polygons are distinct and do not overlap in terms of vertices.
