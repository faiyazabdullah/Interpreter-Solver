STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2740
================================================================================
QUESTION: In \odot S, m \widehat P Q R = 98. Find m \widehat P Q.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center \( S \).
- Points \( P \), \( Q \), \( T \), and \( R \) are marked on the circle.
- \( P \), \( Q \), and \( R \) lie on the circumference.
- \( T \) appears to be the midpoint of \( PR \).
- \( PR = 6 \).
- \( QT \) is drawn perpendicularly from \( Q \) to \( PR \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( PR \) is a chord of the circle.
- \( T \) is the midpoint of \( PR \).
- \( QT \) is perpendicular to \( PR \) and passes through the center \( S \).
- Since \( QT \) is perpendicular to \( PR \) and \( T \) is the midpoint, \( QT \) acts as the perpendicular bisector of \( PR \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( PR = 6 \).
- Since \( T \) is the midpoint of \( PR \), \( PT = TR = \frac{PR}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of arc \( PQ \).
- Given \( \widehat{PQR} = 98^\circ \), we need to find \( \widehat{PQ} \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle and its properties.
- Represent the chord \( PR \) and its midpoint \( T \).
- Represent the perpendicular bisector property.
- Represent the arc measures.
