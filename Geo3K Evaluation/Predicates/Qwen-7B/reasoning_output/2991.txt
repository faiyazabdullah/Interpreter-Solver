STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2991
================================================================================
QUESTION: m \angle B A C = 38, B C = 5, and D C = 5, find m \angle D A C.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure with several triangles and points.
- Points are labeled as A, B, C, D, E, and G.
- Lines connect these points forming multiple triangles.
- Right angle symbols are present at angles BAC and DAC.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC and triangle DAC are present.
- Right angle symbols indicate right angles at BAC and DAC.
- There seems to be a relationship involving perpendicularity and possibly congruence between the triangles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m∠BAC = 38° is given.
- BC = 5.
- DC = 5.
- No direct lengths for the sides of the triangles are explicitly stated, but we need to infer them from the given data.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- We need to determine m∠DAC.
- Given the right angles at BAC and DAC, it suggests that ∠BAC and ∠DAC are complementary.
- The sum of angles around point A in a straight line is 180°.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the right angles, the given angle measure, and the fact that the angles are complementary.
