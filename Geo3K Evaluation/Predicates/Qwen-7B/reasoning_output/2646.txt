STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2646
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the measure of \angle A to the nearest tenth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle \(ABC\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\).
- Side \(AB\) is marked as 27 units.
- Side \(BC\) is marked as 18 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex \(C\).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \(ABC\) is a right triangle with the right angle at vertex \(C\).
- Side \(AB\) is perpendicular to side \(AC\).
- Side \(BC\) is perpendicular to side \(AC\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(AB = 27\) units.
- \(BC = 18\) units.
- \(AC\) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \(\angle A\) to the nearest tenth.
- Since \(\triangle ABC\) is a right triangle with the right angle at \(C\), \(\angle A + \angle B = 90^\circ\).
- We need to find the measure of \(\angle A\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
