STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2986
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x to the nearest tenth. Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a circle with center \(O\).
- Points \(S\) and \(U\) lie on the circle.
- A secant line \(SU\) intersects the circle at point \(T\).
- The segment \(ST\) is tangent to the circle at point \(T\).
- The segment \(TU\) is a secant line.
- The radius \(OR\) is drawn from the center \(O\) to point \(R\).
- The length of \(ST\) is given as 5.
- The length of \(TR\) is given as 9.
- The length \(x\) is the part of the secant \(TU\) that lies outside the circle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \(ST\) is tangent to the circle at \(T\).
- \(OR\) is a radius of the circle.
- \(RT\) is the segment of the secant \(TU\) inside the circle.
- \(TU = ST + RT\).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(ST = 5\)
- \(RT = 9\)
- We need to find \(x\).

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find \(x\).
- This requires using the geometric property involving tangents and secants.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, tangent, secant, and the lengths involved.
