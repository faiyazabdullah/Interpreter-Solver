STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2424
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle B G E.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a cyclic quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D
- There are right angle symbols at vertices A and D
- Angles CAB and CDB are marked as 60 degrees
- Points G, E, F, H are marked on the lines AB, BC, CD, and DA respectively
- Line segments AG, BG, CG, DG, EG, FG, HG, AH are drawn
- Right angles are formed at G and H

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral ABCD is cyclic
- Angles CAB and CDB are both 60 degrees
- Right angles are formed at G and H
- Points G, E, F, H lie on specific line segments

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle CAB = 60 degrees (given)
- Angle CDB = 60 degrees (given)
- Right angles are formed at G and H

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle BGE
- This requires understanding the relationships between the angles and the cyclic nature of the quadrilateral

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the cyclic quadrilateral, right angles, angles, and relationships
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties
