STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2407
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the value of x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a pentagon labeled with points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J.
- Angles at vertices are labeled as follows:
  - Angle at A is \(x - 6\)
  - Angle at B is \(x + 4\)
  - Angle at C is \(x\)
  - Angle at D is \(56^\circ\)
  - Angle at E is \(x + 10\)
- The pentagon is labeled as a pentagon.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure is a pentagon with internal angles summing up to \(540^\circ\).
- The angles at vertices form part of the pentagon's internal structure.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The given angles are \(x - 6\), \(x + 4\), \(x\), \(56^\circ\), and \(x + 10\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the value of \(x\).
- The sum of all internal angles of a pentagon is \(540^\circ\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the pentagon, its internal angles, and the equation formed from the sum of angles.
