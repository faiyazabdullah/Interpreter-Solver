STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2573
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle 1 in the figure.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure with multiple points, lines, and angles.
- Points: H, F, C, D, I, E, G, B, A.
- Lines: HC, CF, CD, DI, EB, GA, FA, BH, BG.
- Angles: ∠1, ∠CFA, ∠BCG, ∠DIE, ∠ABG, ∠CBE, ∠FHA.
- Visible measurements: 
  - ∠CFA = 90°.
  - ∠DIE = 157°.
  - ∠CBE = 90°.
  
### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ∠CFA is a right angle (∠CFA = 90°).
- ∠DIE is an exterior angle of a triangle, so it relates to the interior angles of the triangle formed by points D, I, and E.
- ∠CBE is a right angle (∠CBE = 90°).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- ∠CFA = 90°.
- ∠DIE = 157°.
- ∠CBE = 90°.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find m∠1.
- To determine m∠1, we need to use the relationships between the angles and the given angles.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the right angles, the given angles, and the relationships between them.
- Since ∠1 is part of a larger configuration involving ∠CFA and ∠DIE, we will focus on the angles directly related to ∠1.
