STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2737
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x. Round to the nearest hundredth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a right triangle ABC.
- Vertex B has a right angle symbol.
- Side AB is marked as \( x \).
- Side BC is marked as 13 units.
- Angle ABC measures 52 degrees.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with the right angle at B.
- Side AB is the unknown side.
- Side BC is the known adjacent side (13 units).
- Angle ABC is given as 52 degrees.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The length of BC is 13 units.
- The angle at B is 52 degrees.
- The question asks for the length of AB.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- We need to find the length of AB.
- Using trigonometric relationships, specifically the tangent function, we can solve for AB.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, right angle, lengths, and trigonometric relationships.
