STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2462
================================================================================
QUESTION: A B is a diameter, A C = 8 inches, and B C = 15 inches. Find the radius of the circle.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center \(D\).
- Points \(A\) and \(B\) lie on the circle.
- Line segment \(AB\) is marked as a diameter.
- Points \(C\) and \(D\) are also on the circle.
- The lengths \(AC = 8\) inches and \(BC = 15\) inches are provided.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since \(AB\) is marked as a diameter, it implies that \(\angle ACB = 90^\circ\). This is because a right angle is subtended by a diameter in a semicircle.
- Therefore, \(\triangle ACB\) is a right triangle with the right angle at \(C\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(AC = 8\) inches.
- \(BC = 15\) inches.
- We need to find the radius of the circle.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the radius of the circle.
- The radius of the circle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem applied to the right triangle \(\triangle ACB\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle and its center.
- Represent the right triangle \(\triangle ACB\).
- Capture the given lengths and the right angle property.
