STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2798
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the shaded region. Assume that the polygon is regular unless otherwise stated. Round to the nearest tenth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a pentagon labeled A, B, C, D, E
- The pentagon appears to be regular since it has equal sides and angles
- Side AB is marked as 84 units
- All sides appear to be equal in length
- All interior angles seem to be congruent

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The pentagon ABCDE is regular
- All sides AB, BC, CD, DE, and EA are congruent
- All interior angles at vertices A, B, C, D, and E are congruent

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 84 units (given)
- All sides are 84 units
- The perimeter of the pentagon can be calculated as \(5 \times 84\)

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the shaded region
- Since the pentagon is regular, the shaded region is likely the entire pentagon if no other parts are shaded
- We need to find the area of the pentagon using the given side length

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the pentagon, its sides, and the area calculation
