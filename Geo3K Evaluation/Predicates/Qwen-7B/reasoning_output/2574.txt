STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2574
================================================================================
QUESTION: G J is a diameter of \odot K. Find m \widehat G L J.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center \(K\).
- Points \(G\), \(J\), \(H\), and \(L\) lie on the circumference of the circle.
- A straight line segment \(GJ\) is drawn across the circle, indicating it is a diameter.
- An arc \(GHJ\) is marked with a central angle of \(122^\circ\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \(GJ\) is a diameter of the circle centered at \(K\).
- Since \(GJ\) is a diameter, the central angle subtended by arc \(GHJ\) is \(122^\circ\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The central angle \(\angle GKJ = 122^\circ\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the measure of arc \(GLJ\).
- Since \(GJ\) is a diameter, the total angle around the circle is \(360^\circ\).
- Therefore, the measure of arc \(GLJ\) can be found by subtracting the given central angle from \(360^\circ\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circle, the diameter, the central angle, and the arc.
