STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2411
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the shaded region. Round to the nearest tenth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure consisting of two intersecting circles and a shaded region.
- Points A, B, and C are labeled within the circles.
- A red dot indicates point B where the circles intersect.
- The distance between the top and bottom of the figure is labeled as 20 units.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Two circles intersect at point B.
- The figure appears to be symmetric along the vertical axis passing through point B.
- The shaded region is the area between the two circles.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The total height from the top of one circle to the bottom of the other is 20 units.
- Since the circles intersect at point B, the radius of each circle is half of the total height minus the distance between the centers of the circles.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the shaded region.
- The shaded region is the area between the two circles.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circles, the shaded region, and the measurement of the radii.
- The shaded region is the difference between the area of the larger circle and the smaller circle.
