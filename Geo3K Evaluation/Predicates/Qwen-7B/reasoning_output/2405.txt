STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2405
================================================================================
QUESTION: In the figure below, \angle A B C is intersected by parallel lines l and m. What is the measure of \angle A B C? Express your answer in degrees.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows two parallel lines \( l \) and \( m \).
- There are two angles marked: \( \angle ABD \) and \( \angle ABC \).
- The angle \( \angle ABD \) measures 38°.
- The angle \( \angle ABC \) measures 33°.
- Points \( A, B, C \) lie on the intersection of these lines and form triangles.
- Lines \( AB \) and \( BC \) intersect at point \( B \).

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Lines \( l \) and \( m \) are parallel.
- Angles \( \angle ABD \) and \( \angle ABC \) are adjacent angles formed by the intersection of transversal \( AB \) with the two parallel lines \( l \) and \( m \).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( \angle ABD = 38^\circ \).
- \( \angle ABC = 33^\circ \).
- These angles are supplementary because they form a straight line when added together.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle ABC \), which is already provided as 33°.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallel lines, the angles, and the measurement of the angles.
- Ensure all visible information and constraints are captured.
