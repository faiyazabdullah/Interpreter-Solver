STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2507
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x if \triangle J L M \sim \triangle Q S T.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles labeled JLM and QST.
- Triangle JLM has sides JL, LM, and JM.
- Triangle QST has sides QS, ST, and QT.
- Triangle JLM is marked as similar to triangle QST.
- Angles JML and QTS are marked as equal.
- Angles JLM and QST are marked as equal.
- The lengths of sides in triangle JLM are given as JL = 3y - 2, LM = 6x - 3, and JM = 4.
- The lengths of sides in triangle QST are given as QS = 3, ST = 2, and QT = 5.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangles JLM and QST are similar.
- The corresponding angles JML and QTS are congruent.
- The corresponding angles JLM and QST are congruent.
- Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of their corresponding sides are equal.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- JM = 4
- QS = 3
- ST = 2
- QT = 5
- JL = 3y - 2
- LM = 6x - 3

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of x.
- We need to use the similarity of triangles JLM and QST to find the relationship between the sides.
- The similarity ratio can be set up as:
  \[
  \frac{JL}{QS} = \frac{LM}{ST} = \frac{JM}{QT}
  \]
  Using the known lengths:
  \[
  \frac{3y - 2}{3} = \frac{6x - 3}{2} = \frac{4}{5}
  \]

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangles, their similarity, and the given side lengths.
- Must include the similarity ratio and the equality of the sides.
