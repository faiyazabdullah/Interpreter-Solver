STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2518
================================================================================
QUESTION: Express the ratio of \cos X as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle VWX with vertices labeled V, W, X
- Side VW is marked as 72 units
- Side WX is marked as 21 units
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex W

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle VWX is a right triangle with right angle at vertex W
- Sides VW and WX are perpendicular
- Side VX is the hypotenuse

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- VW = 72 units (given)
- WX = 21 units (given)
- VX length is what the cosine of angle X needs to be calculated for

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the ratio of cos X as a decimal to the nearest hundredth
- This requires using the geometric relationships visible in the triangle
- The problem involves finding the cosine of one of the angles in a right triangle

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties
