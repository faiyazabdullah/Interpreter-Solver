STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2855
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find y.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
- Vertex \( A \) is at the top.
- Vertex \( B \) is at the bottom where a vertical line segment intersects a horizontal line segment.
- Vertex \( C \) is at the right end of the horizontal line segment.
- \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).
- The right angle is marked at vertex \( B \).
- The horizontal line segment is labeled as \( x \).
- The vertical line segment from \( B \) to \( A \) is labeled as \( y \).
- The hypotenuse \( AC \) is labeled as 5 units.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).
- \( AB \) is perpendicular to \( BC \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( AB = y \)
- \( BC = x \)
- \( AC = 5 \)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( y \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangle and its right angle.
- Define the lengths of the sides.
- Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the missing side.
