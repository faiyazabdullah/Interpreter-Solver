STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2979
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the regular polygon. Round to the nearest tenth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a hexagon with vertices labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.
- The hexagon has a shaded region inside it.
- The hexagon appears to be regular because all sides look equal and the angles seem to be equal.
- Side AB is labeled as 3 meters.
- Points A, B, C are connected forming a triangle.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The hexagon is regular.
- The triangle ABC is formed within the hexagon.
- The hexagon's side length is given as 3 meters.
- The triangle ABC is equilateral since all sides of the hexagon are equal.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Side AB = 3 meters.
- Since the hexagon is regular, all sides are equal, so BC = 3 meters and CA = 3 meters.
- The area of an equilateral triangle can be calculated using the formula \( \text{Area} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times s^2 \), where \( s \) is the side length.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the hexagon.
- Since the hexagon is regular and divided into equilateral triangles, we can find the total area by summing the areas of these triangles.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the hexagon as a regular polygon.
- Represent the triangle ABC as an equilateral triangle.
- Calculate the area of the triangle and multiply by 6 to get the total area of the hexagon.
