STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2592
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the shaded region.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a sector of a circle with vertices labeled A, B, and C.
- The central angle of the sector is marked as 240째.
- The radius of the circle is marked as 6 mm.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The sector is part of a larger circle.
- Points A, B, and C lie on the circumference of the circle.
- The angle at the center of the circle is 240째.
- The arc ABC forms the boundary of the sector.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The radius of the circle is 6 mm.
- The measure of the central angle is 240째.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the shaded region.
- The shaded region is the sector formed by the central angle of 240째.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, sector, and the area of the sector.
- Must include the radius and the measure of the central angle.
