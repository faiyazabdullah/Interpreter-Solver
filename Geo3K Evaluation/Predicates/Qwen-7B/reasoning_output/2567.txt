STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2567
================================================================================
QUESTION: Quadrilateral E F G H is a rectangle. If m \angle H G E = 13, find m \angle F G E.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rectangle EFGH.
- The vertices are labeled E, F, G, H.
- Line segments EF, FG, GH, and HE form the sides of the rectangle.
- There are right angle symbols at corners E and H, indicating right angles.
- Line segment EG connects two opposite corners of the rectangle.
- There is an angle labeled m∠HGE = 13°.
- No other measurements or markings are explicitly provided.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral EFGH is a rectangle.
- Right angles exist at vertices E and H.
- Line segment EG connects two opposite corners of the rectangle.
- The angle m∠HGE is given as 13°.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m∠HGE = 13° (given)
- No other specific measurements are provided.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the measure of ∠FGE.
- In a rectangle, opposite angles are equal.
- Since m∠HGE = 13°, we need to determine if there is any relationship between ∠FGE and ∠HGE.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the rectangle and the given angle measurement.
- The angle ∠FGE is related to the angle ∠HGE due to the properties of rectangles.
