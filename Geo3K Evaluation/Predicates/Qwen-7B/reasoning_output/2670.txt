REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rectangle labeled \(ABCD\) with vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- The rectangle has a diagonal \(AC\) drawn inside it.
- Points \(E\) are marked at the intersection of the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\).
- Angles are labeled: \(\angle 1\), \(\angle 2\), \(\angle 3\), \(\angle 4\), \(\angle 5\), \(\angle 6\), \(\angle 7\), and \(\angle 8\).
- Measurements are provided: \(\angle 2 = 40^\circ\).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is a rectangle.
- Diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at point \(E\).
- Angles \(\angle 1\), \(\angle 2\), \(\angle 3\), \(\angle 4\), \(\angle 5\), \(\angle 6\), \(\angle 7\), and \(\angle 8\) are formed by the diagonals.
- \(\angle 2\) is given as \(40^\circ\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(\angle 2 = 40^\circ\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \(\angle 3\).
- Since \(\angle 2\) and \(\angle 3\) are opposite angles in the rectangle, they are supplementary angles.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the rectangle and its properties.
- Represent the measurement of \(\angle 2\) and use the relationship between \(\angle 2\) and \(\angle 3\).
