STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2654
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the regular polygon figure. Round to the nearest tenth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a regular hexagon with vertices labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.
- The side length of the hexagon is 6 cm.
- There are no right angles, parallel lines, or perpendicular lines marked.
- No specific geometric relationships or markings are explicitly stated other than the side length.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The hexagon is regular, meaning all sides are equal and all interior angles are equal.
- No special markings indicate parallelism or perpendicularity among the sides.
- The hexagon is symmetric, implying certain angles are congruent.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The side length of the hexagon is given as 6 cm.
- No other numerical values are provided for angles or additional segments.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the regular hexagon.
- To find the area, we need the formula involving the side length of the hexagon.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the regular hexagon and its side length.
- The area formula for a regular hexagon is \( \text{Area} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} \times s^2 \), where \( s \) is the side length.
