STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2429
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the parallelogram. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a parallelogram \(ABCD\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- Side \(AB\) is marked as \(14 \text{ mm}\).
- Side \(AD\) is marked as \(7 \text{ mm}\).
- Angle \(D\) is labeled as \(60^\circ\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram, so opposite sides are equal (\(AB = CD\) and \(AD = BC\)).
- Opposite angles are equal (\(\angle A = \angle C\) and \(\angle B = \angle D\)).
- Adjacent angles sum to \(180^\circ\) (\(\angle A + \angle D = 180^\circ\)).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(AB = 14 \text{ mm}\)
- \(AD = 7 \text{ mm}\)
- \(\angle D = 60^\circ\)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the parallelogram \(ABCD\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, its sides, angles, and the area calculation.
