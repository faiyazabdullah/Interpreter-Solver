STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2809
================================================================================
QUESTION: The ratio of the measure of the angles of the triangle below is 3 : 2 : 1. Which of the following is not an angle measure of the triangle?

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, and C.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B.
- The angles at vertices A, B, and C are labeled as Angle(A), Angle(B), and Angle(C) respectively.
- The ratio of the measures of these angles is given as 3:2:1.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with the right angle at B.
- Angle A + Angle B + Angle C = 180°.
- Since it is a right triangle, Angle B = 90°.
- Therefore, the sum of Angle A and Angle C is 90°.
- Given the ratio 3:2:1, we can determine the measures of the angles as follows:
  - Let Angle A = 3x.
  - Let Angle C = x.
  - Therefore, 3x + x = 90°, which simplifies to 4x = 90°.
  - Solving for x gives x = 90° / 4 = 22.5°.
  - Hence, Angle A = 3 * 22.5° = 67.5°.
  - And Angle C = 22.5°.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- No numerical lengths are explicitly given in the diagram. However, the angles have been determined.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks which angle measure is not part of the triangle.
- We know the angles are Angle(A) = 67.5°, Angle(B) = 90°, and Angle(C) = 22.5°.
- Since the angles must sum up to 180° in a triangle and one of them is already known to be 90°, the remaining two angles must add up to 90°.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the angles and their relationships.
- The angles are Angle(A), Angle(B), and Angle(C).
- The angles are related by the fact that they sum up to 180°, specifically with Angle(B) being 90°.
