STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2704
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x. A = 357 in^2.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a right triangle \(ABC\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\).
- Side \(AB\) is marked as \(x\) inches.
- Side \(BC\) is marked as 34 inches.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex \(B\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \(ABC\) is a right triangle with the right angle at \(B\).
- \(AB\) and \(BC\) are perpendicular.
- \(AB\) is one of the legs of the triangle.
- \(BC\) is the base of the triangle.
- \(AC\) is the hypotenuse.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(BC = 34\) inches (given).
- \(AB = x\) inches.
- We need to find the length of \(AC\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \(x\).
- This requires using the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse \(AC\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- We will capture the lengths of the sides and the right angle.
