STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2616
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x. Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows a right triangle \( \triangle JHK \) where \( H \) is the point of tangency.
- \( JK = 6 \) and \( HJ = 4 \).
- \( G \) is a point on the circle such that \( GH \) is a tangent to the circle.
- The circle is centered at \( A \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( \triangle JHK \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( H \).
- \( GH \) is tangent to the circle at \( H \).
- The circle is centered at \( A \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( JK = 6 \).
- \( HJ = 4 \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( x \), which appears to be the length of the tangent segment \( GH \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and the tangent property.
