STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2997
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a circle with center \( O \).
- Points \( F, G, H, J \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
- An arc \( FG \) is marked with a measurement of \( 70^\circ \).
- Points \( H \) and \( J \) are connected by a straight line segment \( HJ \).
- The angle \( x^\circ \) is formed by the intersection of lines \( OH \) and \( OJ \).

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( O \) is the center of the circle.
- \( FG \) is an arc subtending an angle of \( 70^\circ \) at the center.
- \( H \) and \( J \) are points on the circle, and \( OH \) and \( OJ \) are radii of the circle.
- \( x^\circ \) is the angle formed at the center \( O \) by the radii \( OH \) and \( OJ \).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The arc \( FG \) subtends an angle of \( 70^\circ \) at the center \( O \).
- The angle \( x^\circ \) is the central angle formed by the radii \( OH \) and \( OJ \).

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle \( x^\circ \).
- Since the angle \( x^\circ \) is formed at the center of the circle by two radii, it is equal to the angle subtended by the arc \( FG \).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, its center, the arc, and the central angle.
- Must capture the relationship between the central angle and the arc subtended by the same radii.
