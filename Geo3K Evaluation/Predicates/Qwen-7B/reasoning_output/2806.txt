STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2806
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find \angle C of quadrilateral A B C D.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D.
- Angles at A and D are marked as \(3x^\circ\) and \(x^\circ\) respectively.
- Lines AB and CD are parallel.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B, indicating a right angle there.
- There is no indication of parallelism or perpendicularity between sides AD and BC.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral ABCD appears to be a rectangle because of the right angle at B and the parallel lines AB and CD.
- Since AB is horizontal and CD is horizontal and parallel, AD and BC are vertical and also parallel.
- The angles at A and D are supplementary to the right angle at B.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The angles at A and D are given as \(3x^\circ\) and \(x^\circ\).
- The sum of angles around point A plus the right angle at B should be \(360^\circ\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle C.
- Since ABCD is a rectangle, angle C is a right angle.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the quadrilateral, the angles at A and D, the right angle at B, and the fact that ABCD is a rectangle.
- Since angle C is a right angle, we don't need additional predicates for this specific angle.
