STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2434
================================================================================
QUESTION: Let G H be the median of R S B A. Find G H.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral \(ABST\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(S\), and \(T\).
- There is a horizontal line segment \(AB\) and a vertical line segment \(ST\).
- A point \(R\) is on the horizontal line segment \(PS\) such that \(PR = 54\).
- A point \(Q\) is on the horizontal line segment \(QT\) such that \(QT = 86\).
- A median \(GH\) is drawn from point \(G\) to the midpoint \(H\) of \(AB\).

Step 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral \(ABST\) appears to be a rectangle due to the right angles indicated by the perpendicular markings.
- The horizontal line segment \(AB\) and the vertical line segment \(ST\) are perpendicular.
- Median \(GH\) connects the vertex \(G\) of the rectangle to the midpoint \(H\) of the opposite side \(AB\).

Step 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of \(PR = 54\).
- Length of \(QT = 86\).

Step 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \(GH\).
- Since \(GH\) is the median of the rectangle, it is half the length of the diagonal of the rectangle.

Step 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the quadrilateral as a rectangle.
- Represent the lengths of \(PR\) and \(QT\).
- Represent the median \(GH\) as half the length of the diagonal of the rectangle.
