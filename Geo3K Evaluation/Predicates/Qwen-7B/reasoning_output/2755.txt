STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2755
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle H.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a pentagon labeled EFGHI with vertices E, F, G, H, J.
- Angles at vertices E, F, G, H, and J are labeled with expressions involving 'x'.
- Angle at vertex H is specifically labeled as (x + 5)°.
- Angle at vertex J is labeled as (x + 10)°.
- Angle at vertex E is labeled as (x + 20)°.
- Angle at vertex G is labeled as (x - 5)°.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The pentagon has internal angles summing up to (5-2) × 180° = 540°.
- The sum of all angles around point J should be 360°.
- Angles at vertices E, F, G, H, and J form the interior and exterior angles of the pentagon.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- We have five angles expressed in terms of 'x': (x + 20)°, (x + 5)°, (x - 5)°, (x + 5)°, and (x + 10)°.
- The total sum of these angles must equal 540°.
- The sum of angles around point J is 360°.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the measure of angle H, which is (x + 5)°.
- We need to use the relationships between the angles to find x and then determine m∠H.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the pentagon, the angles, and the sum of angles properties.
