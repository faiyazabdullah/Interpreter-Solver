STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2881
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find E G if G is the incenter of \triangle A B C.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with vertices labeled \( A, B, C \).
- Side \( AB \) is marked as 5 units long.
- Side \( BC \) is marked as 12 units long.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex \( B \), indicating that \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at vertex \( B \).
- Sides \( AB \) and \( BC \) are perpendicular.
- Side \( AC \) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.
- Since \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem can be applied to find the length of \( AC \).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( AB = 5 \) units.
- \( BC = 12 \) units.
- The length of the hypotenuse \( AC \) needs to be found using the Pythagorean theorem.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( AC \).
- The Pythagorean theorem states that \( AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 \).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and apply the Pythagorean theorem.
