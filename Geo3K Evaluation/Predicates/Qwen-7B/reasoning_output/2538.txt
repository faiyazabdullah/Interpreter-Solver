STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2538
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the measure of \angle 3 in the figure.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows two triangles: \( \triangle ABC \) and \( \triangle DEF \).
- \( \triangle ABC \) has vertices \( A, B, C \).
- \( \triangle DEF \) has vertices \( D, E, F \).
- Angles \( \angle A \), \( \angle B \), and \( \angle C \) are labeled with measures \( 78^\circ \), \( 50^\circ \), and \( 52^\circ \) respectively.
- The diagram includes a straight line passing through points \( B \) and \( G \), dividing it into segments labeled as \( GB = 2 \) and \( BG = 4 \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( \triangle ABC \) is a triangle with angles \( \angle A = 78^\circ \), \( \angle B = 50^\circ \), and thus \( \angle C = 52^\circ \).
- \( \triangle DEF \) is also a triangle with angles \( \angle D = 50^\circ \) and \( \angle E = 56^\circ \). Since the sum of angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \), \( \angle F = 74^\circ \).
- The line segment \( BG \) divides the straight line through \( B \) into two parts: \( GB = 2 \) and \( BG = 4 \).
- Points \( B, G, C \) are collinear.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The angles \( \angle A = 78^\circ \), \( \angle B = 50^\circ \), and \( \angle C = 52^\circ \).
- The angles \( \angle D = 50^\circ \), \( \angle E = 56^\circ \), and \( \angle F = 74^\circ \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 3 \).
- From the diagram, \( \angle 3 \) is part of \( \triangle DEF \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangles, angles, and relationships between them.
