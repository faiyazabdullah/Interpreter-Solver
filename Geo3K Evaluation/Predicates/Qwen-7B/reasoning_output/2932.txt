STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2932
================================================================================
QUESTION: For trapezoid A B C D, S and T are midpoints of the legs. If C D = 14, S T = 10, and A B = 2 x, find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a trapezoid \(ABCD\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- Points \(S\) and \(T\) are midpoints of sides \(AD\) and \(BC\) respectively.
- \(CD\) is marked as 14 units.
- \(ST\) is marked as 10 units.
- \(AB\) is marked as \(2x\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \(AB\) and \(CD\) are parallel sides of the trapezoid.
- \(ST\) is the midsegment connecting the midpoints of the non-parallel sides \(AD\) and \(BC\).
- \(ST\) is parallel to \(AB\) and \(CD\).
- The lengths of the parallel sides \(CD\) and \(AB\) are related by the midsegment theorem.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(CD = 14\) units.
- \(ST = 10\) units.
- \(AB = 2x\) units.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the value of \(x\).
- The midsegment theorem states that the length of the midsegment (\(ST\)) is equal to half the sum of the lengths of the two parallel sides (\(AB\) and \(CD\)).
- The equation to solve is \(ST = \frac{1}{2}(AB + CD)\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the trapezoid, midpoints, lengths of the sides, and the midsegment relationship.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
