STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2404
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle C A M.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows a circle with center \( M \).
- Points \( A, B, C, D, T, N \) lie on the circle.
- Line segments \( AB, BC, CD, DA, NT, MT \) are drawn within the circle.
- Right angle symbols are present at point \( A \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Points \( A, B, C, D \) are concyclic, meaning they lie on the same circle.
- \( AB, BC, CD, DA \) form the sides of a cyclic quadrilateral.
- \( NT \) and \( MT \) are radii of the circle.
- \( \angle T = 28^\circ \).
- \( \angle CAM \) is a central angle subtended by arc \( CD \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( \angle T = 28^\circ \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \( m \angle CAM \).
- Since \( \angle CAM \) is a central angle subtended by arc \( CD \), it is equal to half the measure of arc \( CD \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle and its center.
- Represent the cyclic quadrilateral and the right angle at point \( A \).
- Represent the central angle subtended by arc \( CD \).
