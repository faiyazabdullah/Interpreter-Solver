STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2726
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles labeled LMK and XYZ.
- Triangle LMK has vertices L, M, N.
- Triangle XYZ has vertices X, Y, Z.
- Triangle LMK has an angle at L marked as 65°.
- Triangle LMK has an angle at M marked as 51°.
- The remaining angle in triangle LMK can be calculated since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°.
- Triangle XYZ has an angle at X marked as (4x)°.
- Triangle XYZ appears to be isosceles because it seems to have two equal sides.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle LMK is a triangle with angles 65°, 51°, and the remaining angle which we need to calculate.
- Triangle XYZ is isosceles with angle at X as (4x)°.
- The sum of angles in triangle XYZ must be 180°.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle L in triangle LMK is 65°.
- Angle M in triangle LMK is 51°.
- Angle N in triangle LMK is 180° - 65° - 51° = 64°.
- Angle X in triangle XYZ is (4x)°.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find x.
- We need to use the properties of triangles and the fact that triangle XYZ is isosceles.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the angles and the fact that triangle XYZ is isosceles.
- We will derive the value of x from the sum of angles in triangle XYZ.
