STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2955
================================================================================
QUESTION: \angle 6 and \angle 8 are complementary, m \angle 8 = 47. Find the measure of \angle 7.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- Side AB is marked as 6 units.
- Side BC is marked as 7 units.
- Side CA is marked as 8 units.
- There are no right angles or special markings indicated on the diagram.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a scalene triangle with sides AB, BC, and CA.
- No specific relationships such as perpendicularity or parallelism are implied by the diagram.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 6 units (given)
- BC = 7 units (given)
- CA = 8 units (given)

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle 7.
- The problem involves finding the measure of angle 7 in triangle ABC.
- Since there are no right angles or specific angle measures provided, we need to determine the angles using the lengths of the sides.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, the sides' lengths, and the measure of angle 7.
