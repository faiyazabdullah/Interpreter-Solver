STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2941
================================================================================
QUESTION: In the figure, square A B D C is inscribed in \odot K. Find the measure of a central angle.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a square \(ABCD\) inscribed in circle \(\odot K\).
- Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are labeled, forming the vertices of the square.
- The circle's center \(K\) is also labeled, but its coordinates are not explicitly given.
- Right angle symbols (\(\perp\)) are marked at vertices \(A\) and \(C\).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \(ABCD\) is a square because opposite sides are equal and all interior angles are right angles (\(90^\circ\)).
- Since \(ABCD\) is a square, all sides are equal.
- The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at point \(F\) and are equal in length.
- The diagonals bisect each other perpendicularly at point \(F\).
- Point \(G\) lies on the diagonal \(AC\) and is the midpoint of the diagonal.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Since the problem does not provide specific lengths, we need to focus on the properties rather than specific numerical values.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of a central angle formed by the diagonals of the square.
- In a square inscribed in a circle, the diagonals form four congruent right triangles and divide the circle into four equal arcs.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the square, the circle, and the relationship between the diagonals and the central angles.
