STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2922
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary. Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with a secant line intersecting it at two points, F and E.
- Points A, B, C, D, and E lie on the circumference of the circle.
- Segments AF, BF, CF, and DF are tangent to the circle at points F and E.
- The lengths of segments AF and BF are given as \(3x\) and \(x+2\), respectively.
- The length of segment EF is given as 8.
- The length of segment DF is given as \(x\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Segments AF, BF, CF, and DF are tangents to the circle from the same external point.
- Tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length.
- Therefore, \(AF = CF\) and \(BF = DF\).
- Given \(AF = 3x\) and \(BF = x + 2\), we need to equate them since they are tangents from the same point.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- We have the lengths \(AF = 3x\), \(BF = x + 2\), \(EF = 8\), and \(DF = x\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the value of \(x\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the equality of tangents, the given lengths, and the relationship involving \(x\).
