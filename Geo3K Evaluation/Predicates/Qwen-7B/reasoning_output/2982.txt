STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2982
================================================================================
QUESTION: m \angle 4 = 42. Find m \angle 7.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two intersecting lines labeled as \(a\) and \(b\).
- Points \(C\), \(D\), \(E\), \(F\), \(G\), and \(H\) are marked on the lines.
- Angles \(1\), \(2\), \(3\), \(4\), \(5\), \(6\), \(7\), and \(8\) are marked with corresponding measurements.
- Angle \(4\) is labeled as \(42^\circ\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Lines \(a\) and \(b\) appear to be intersecting, forming angles at point \(D\).
- Angle \(4\) measures \(42^\circ\).
- Angles around point \(D\) are supplementary and alternate interior angles due to the intersection of the lines.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(m \angle 4 = 42^\circ\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \(m \angle 7\).
- Since \(m \angle 4 = 42^\circ\), we need to determine the relationship between \(\angle 4\) and \(\angle 7\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the angles and their relationships.
