STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2961
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find J L.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a triangle \( \triangle JKL \).
- Vertex \( J \) has a right angle symbol.
- Side \( JL \) is labeled as \( x + 12 \).
- Side \( JK \) is labeled as \( 7x \).
- Side \( KL \) is labeled as \( 11x - 8 \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( \triangle JKL \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( J \).
- Side \( JK \) is perpendicular to side \( JL \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( JK = 7x \).
- \( JL = x + 12 \).
- \( KL = 11x - 8 \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the length of \( JL \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, right angle, lengths, and relationships.
- We need to ensure all visible geometric constraints and properties are captured.
