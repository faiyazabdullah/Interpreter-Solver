STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2558
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find R S if \triangle Q R S is an equilateral triangle.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle \( \triangle QRS \).
- The vertices are labeled as \( Q \), \( R \), and \( S \).
- The sides are labeled with expressions: \( QR = 4x \), \( RS = 2x + 1 \), and \( QS = 6x - 1 \).
- The triangle is an equilateral triangle, meaning all sides are equal.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since \( \triangle QRS \) is an equilateral triangle, all its sides are equal.
- Therefore, we have the equation: \( 4x = 2x + 1 \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- From the equation \( 4x = 2x + 1 \), we can solve for \( x \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( RS \).
- Since \( RS = 2x + 1 \), we need to find the value of \( RS \) after solving for \( x \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the equilateral triangle property and solve for \( x \).
