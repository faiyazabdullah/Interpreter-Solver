STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2402
================================================================================
QUESTION: Circle O has a radius of 13 inches. Radius O B is perpendicular to chord C D which is 24 inches long. Find O X.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows a circle centered at point \(O\).
- The radius \(OB\) is drawn from the center \(O\) to point \(B\).
- Chord \(CD\) is perpendicular to \(OB\) at point \(X\).
- Chord \(CD\) is given as 24 inches long.
- The radius \(OB\) is given as 13 inches.
- Point \(X\) lies on the chord \(CD\) where \(CD\) is perpendicular to \(OB\).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \(OB \perp CD\)
- \(OB\) is a radius of the circle.
- \(CD\) is a chord of the circle.
- \(OB\) bisects \(CD\) at \(X\).
- Since \(OB\) is perpendicular to \(CD\) and passes through its midpoint \(X\), \(X\) divides \(CD\) into two equal segments.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Radius \(OB = 13\) inches.
- Length of chord \(CD = 24\) inches.
- \(X\) is the midpoint of \(CD\), so \(CX = XD = 12\) inches.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the distance \(OX\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circle, the radius, the chord, the perpendicularity, and the midpoint.
- We will use predicates to describe these relationships.
