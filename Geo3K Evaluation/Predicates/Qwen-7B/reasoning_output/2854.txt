STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2854
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find h in the triangle.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AB is marked as 6 units
- Side AC is marked as 4 units
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex C
- Angle A is labeled as 60 degrees

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at C
- Sides AC and BC are perpendicular
- Side AB is the hypotenuse
- Angle A measures 60 degrees
- Angle B measures 90 degrees (since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees)

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 6 units (given)
- AC = 4 units (given)
- BC length is what the question is asking for

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of BC
- This requires using trigonometric relationships in the right triangle

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties
