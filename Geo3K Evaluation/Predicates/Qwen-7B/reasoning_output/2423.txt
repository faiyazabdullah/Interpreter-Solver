STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2423
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find A B if \triangle A B C is an isosceles triangle with A B \cong B C.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
- The vertices are labeled \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
- Sides \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( AC \) are labeled with expressions involving \( x \).
- \( AB = 2x - 7 \)
- \( BC = 4x - 21 \)
- \( AC = x - 3 \)

No special markings (like right angle symbols, parallel lines, etc.) are visible in the diagram.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since \( \triangle ABC \) is stated to be an isosceles triangle with \( AB \cong BC \):
  \[
  AB = BC
  \]
- Therefore:
  \[
  2x - 7 = 4x - 21
  \]

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- We need to solve the equation \( 2x - 7 = 4x - 21 \) to find the value of \( x \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find \( AB \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangle and the equality relationship between the sides.
