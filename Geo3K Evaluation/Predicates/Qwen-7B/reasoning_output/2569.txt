STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2569
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find \angle 5.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure with points labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I.
- Angles are labeled as ∠A, ∠B, ∠C, ∠D, ∠E, ∠F, ∠G, ∠H, ∠I.
- The angles are measured as follows:
  - ∠A = 110°
  - ∠B = 150°
- There are no visible right angles or other special markings indicating parallelism or perpendicularity.
- Points D, E, F, G, H, I lie on a circle with center O (not explicitly shown).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The points D, E, F, G, H, I form a cyclic quadrilateral (a quadrilateral inscribed in a circle).
- Since points D, E, F, G, H, I lie on the circle, we can use properties of cyclic quadrilaterals.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The angle ∠A is given as 110°.
- The angle ∠B is given as 150°.
- We need to find the measure of ∠5, which corresponds to the angle formed at point D.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of ∠5.
- To find ∠5, we need to use the property of cyclic quadrilaterals where the opposite angles sum up to 180°.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the cyclic quadrilateral and the relationship between the angles.
- The angles ∠A and ∠B are given, so we can calculate the remaining angles in the cyclic quadrilateral.
