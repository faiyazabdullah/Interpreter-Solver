STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2889
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x. Round to the nearest tenth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle \( \triangle DGF \) with vertices labeled \( D \), \( G \), and \( F \).
- Side \( DG \) is marked as 15 units.
- Side \( GF \) is marked as 19 units.
- Side \( DF \) is marked as \( x \).
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex \( G \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \( \triangle DGF \) contains a right angle at vertex \( G \).
- \( \angle DGF = 125^\circ \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( DG = 15 \) units (given).
- \( GF = 19 \) units (given).
- \( DF = x \) units (variable we need to find).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find \( x \).
- Since \( \angle DGF = 125^\circ \), it implies \( \angle DGF \) is part of the triangle, and we need to use trigonometric relationships involving the right angle.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and the relationship involving the cosine function due to the right angle.
