STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2903
================================================================================
QUESTION: Express the ratio of \sin N as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle PMN with vertices labeled P, M, N.
- Side PN is marked as 15 units.
- Side NM is marked as 36 units.
- Side PM is marked as 39 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex N.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle PMN is a right triangle with right angle at vertex N.
- Side PM is the hypotenuse of the triangle.
- Sides PN and NM are perpendicular to each other.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- PN = 15 units (given)
- NM = 36 units (given)
- PM = 39 units (given)

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the ratio of sin N.
- Since triangle PMN is a right triangle with the right angle at N, sin N is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships involving the sine function.
