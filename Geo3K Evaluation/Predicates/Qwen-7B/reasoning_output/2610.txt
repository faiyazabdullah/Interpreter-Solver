STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2610
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find y.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AB is marked as 12 units
- Side AC is marked as x
- Side BC is marked as y
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at B
- Sides AB and BC are perpendicular
- Side AC is the hypotenuse

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 12 units (given)
- BC = y (given)
- AC = x (given)

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the lengths of sides BC (y) and AC (x)
- This requires using the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse AC.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties
