STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2977
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find G D.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle \( \triangle DJG \) with vertices labeled \( D, J, G \).
- \( DJ \) is marked as 10 units.
- \( DG \) is marked as \( 2x - 2 \).
- \( GD \) is marked as \( 2x + 4 \).
- There are right angle symbols at \( G \) and \( D \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \( \triangle DJG \) appears to be a right triangle since there are right angle symbols at \( G \) and \( D \).
- \( DG \) is perpendicular to \( DJ \).
- \( DG \) is a leg of the right triangle, and \( DJ \) is the hypotenuse.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( DJ = 10 \) units.
- \( DG = 2x - 2 \) units.
- \( GD = 2x + 4 \) units.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( GD \).
- This requires using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle \( \triangle DJG \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, lengths, and the relationship between the sides.
