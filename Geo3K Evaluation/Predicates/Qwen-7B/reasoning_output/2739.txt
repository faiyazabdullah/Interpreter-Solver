STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2739
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the parallelogram.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a parallelogram ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, and D.
- Side AB is marked as 21 cm.
- Side BC is marked as 17 cm.
- Side CD is marked as 21 cm.
- Side DA is marked as 17 cm.
- A dashed line from point A to point E is drawn perpendicular to line BC, intersecting at point E.
- The length of segment BE is marked as 8 cm.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure is a parallelogram with sides AB = CD = 21 cm and AD = BC = 17 cm.
- Line segments AB and CD are parallel.
- Line segments AD and BC are parallel.
- The dashed line AE is perpendicular to BC.
- Segment BE measures 8 cm.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 21 cm
- BC = 17 cm
- BE = 8 cm
- AE is the height of the parallelogram.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the parallelogram.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, its sides, height, and the relationship between the height and base.
