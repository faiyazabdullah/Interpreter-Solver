STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2491
================================================================================
QUESTION: Express the ratio of \cos B as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- Side AB is marked as 26 units.
- Side BC is marked as 10 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex C.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with the right angle at vertex C.
- Sides AB and BC are perpendicular.
- Side AC is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 26 units (given).
- BC = 10 units (given).

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the ratio of cos B as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.
- To find cos B, we need the length of AC using the Pythagorean theorem.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
