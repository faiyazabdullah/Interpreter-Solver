STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2923
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle labeled \( \triangle ABC \).
- The vertices are labeled \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
- Side \( AB \) is marked as 5 units.
- Side \( BC \) is marked as 12 units.
- Side \( AC \) is marked as \( x \).
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex \( B \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at vertex \( B \).
- \( AB \perp BC \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( AB = 5 \) units.
- \( BC = 12 \) units.
- We need to find the length of \( AC \), denoted as \( x \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( x \).
- This requires using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (\( AC \)) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (\( AB \) and \( BC \)).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, the right angle, the lengths of the sides, and the relationship between the sides.
