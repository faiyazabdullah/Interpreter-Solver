STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2546
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the shaded sector. Round to the nearest tenth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a sector of a circle with vertices labeled X, Y, W.
- The arc XY is part of the circle.
- The central angle at point X is labeled as 52°.
- The radius of the circle is labeled as 2 cm.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure represents a sector of a circle.
- The central angle is 52°.
- The radius of the circle is 2 cm.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The radius \( r \) is 2 cm.
- The central angle \( \theta \) is 52°.
- The area of the sector needs to be calculated.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the shaded sector.
- The formula for the area of a sector is \( \text{Area} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi r^2 \).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, the sector, the radius, and the central angle.
- Must include the given measurements and the relationship between them.
