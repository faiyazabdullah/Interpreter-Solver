STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2896
================================================================================
QUESTION: Use parallelogram J K L M to find m \angle J M L.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral JKLM with vertices J, K, L, and M.
- The quadrilateral appears to be a parallelogram, as indicated by the parallel lines and equal opposite sides.
- There is a measurement of 6 units along segment ML.
- There is an angle labeled as 109 degrees at vertex K.
- There are no right angle symbols, parallel marks, or congruent marks visible.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral JKLM is a parallelogram.
- JK is parallel to LM and JM is parallel to KL.
- Opposite sides are equal: JK = LM and JM = KL.
- Adjacent angles are supplementary: ∠J + ∠K = 180°.
- ∠K = 109° implies ∠J = 71° since they are adjacent angles in a parallelogram.
- No additional relationships are explicitly marked in the diagram.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- ML = 6 units.
- No other lengths are explicitly given, but we know JK = LM and JM = KL due to the properties of a parallelogram.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for m∠JML.
- Since ∠J is 71° in a parallelogram, and knowing that consecutive angles are supplementary, ∠JML would be the remaining angle in the parallelogram involving ∠J.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram and its properties.
- Must include the given angle and the relationship between the angles in the parallelogram.
