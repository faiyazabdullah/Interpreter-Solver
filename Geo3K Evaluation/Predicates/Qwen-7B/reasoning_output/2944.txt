STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2944
================================================================================
QUESTION: Quadrilateral W X Y Z is a rectangle. Find the measure of \angle 2 if m \angle 1 = 30.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a rectangle \(WXYZ\).
- Points \(W\), \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\) are labeled.
- Lines \(WX\), \(XY\), \(YZ\), and \(ZW\) form the sides of the rectangle.
- Angles \(W\), \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\) are labeled as right angles.
- Numerical labels \(1\), \(2\), \(3\), ..., \(12\) indicate specific line segments within the rectangle.
- Right angle symbols are placed at vertices \(W\), \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \(WXYZ\) is a rectangle, meaning all its interior angles are right angles.
- Opposite sides are parallel and equal in length (\(WX = YZ\) and \(XY = WZ\)).
- Diagonals \(WX\) and \(YZ\) intersect at point \(O\), dividing the rectangle into four triangles.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The problem states that \(m\angle 1 = 30^\circ\).
- No direct numerical lengths are provided for the sides of the rectangle or any specific line segments.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \(\angle 2\).
- Since \(\angle 1 = 30^\circ\) and the sum of angles around point \(O\) is \(180^\circ\), we need to find \(\angle 2\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the rectangle, right angles, and the relationship between the angles \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 2\).
