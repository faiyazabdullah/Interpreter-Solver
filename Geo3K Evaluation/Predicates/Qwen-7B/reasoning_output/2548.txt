STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2548
================================================================================
QUESTION: Quadrilateral D E F G is a rectangle. If m \angle E D F = 5 x - 3 and m \angle D F G = 3 x + 7, find m \angle E D F.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral DEFG with vertices D, E, F, and G.
- Angles ∠EDF and ∠DFG are labeled with expressions: m∠EDF = 5x - 3 and m∠DFG = 3x + 7.
- The quadrilateral DEFG is a rectangle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since DEFG is a rectangle, opposite angles are equal (∠EDF = ∠DGF).
- Adjacent angles are supplementary (∠EDF + ∠DFG = 180°).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- We need to find the measure of ∠EDF, given the expressions for ∠DFG and ∠EDF.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- We need to determine the value of x such that the sum of ∠EDF and ∠DFG equals 180°.
- The equation will be: (5x - 3) + (3x + 7) = 180.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the angles and their relationships in terms of x.
