STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2497
================================================================================
QUESTION: In H, the diameter is 18, L M = 12, and m \widehat L M = 84. Find H P. Round to the nearest hundredth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a circle with center \( H \).
- The diameter \( J K \) is marked and its length is given as 18 units.
- The point \( L \) lies on the circle.
- The segment \( L M \) is marked with a length of 12 units.
- The arc \( L M \) subtends an angle at the center \( H \) marked as \( 84^\circ \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The line segment \( J K \) is a diameter of the circle.
- The point \( P \) is where the line segment \( L M \) intersects the diameter \( J K \).
- The segment \( L M \) is perpendicular to the diameter \( J K \).
- The angle \( \angle L M H \) is given as \( 84^\circ \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The diameter \( J K = 18 \) units.
- The length \( L M = 12 \) units.
- The angle \( \angle L M H = 84^\circ \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( H P \).
- We need to find the length of the segment from the center of the circle \( H \) to the point \( P \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, diameter, perpendicular segment, angle, and the length relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
