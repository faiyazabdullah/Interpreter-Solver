STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2493
================================================================================
QUESTION: In \odot M, F L = 24, H J = 48, and m \widehat H P = 65. Find F G.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle centered at \( M \).
- Points \( F, G, H, I, J, K, L, P, \) and \( Q \) lie on the circle.
- \( F, L, H, J \) form two chords intersecting at point \( M \).
- \( L \) and \( N \) form a right angle at point \( M \).
- \( F L = 24 \) and \( H J = 48 \).
- \( \angle HPQ = 65^\circ \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( \angle HMP \) and \( \angle JMP \) are inscribed angles subtending the same arc.
- \( \angle HMP = \angle JMP = \frac{1}{2} \angle HPQ = \frac{1}{2} \times 65^\circ = 32.5^\circ \).
- \( F L \perp H J \) because \( L \) and \( N \) form a right angle at \( M \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Given: \( FL = 24 \) and \( HJ = 48 \).
- \( \angle HMP = 32.5^\circ \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find \( FG \).
- Since \( FG \) is a chord of the circle, we need to use the fact that the perpendicular from the center \( M \) to the chord \( FG \) bisects the chord into two equal parts.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle, points, lines, and angles.
- Represent the given lengths and right angles.
- Represent the relationship between the chords and the circle's properties.
