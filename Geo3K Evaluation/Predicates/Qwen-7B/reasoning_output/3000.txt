STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 3000
================================================================================
QUESTION: A B C D is a rhombus. If P B = 12, A B = 15, and m \angle A B D = 24. Find m \angle B D A.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows a quadrilateral ABCD.
- Points A, B, C, D are labeled.
- Lines AB, BC, CD, DA connect these points.
- There are no right angle symbols, parallel marks, or congruent marks visible.
- The lengths PB = 12, AB = 15, and the measure of ∠ABD = 24° are provided.
- No other specific markings or angles are provided for other parts of the quadrilateral.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral ABCD is a rhombus because diagonals AC and BD bisect each other at right angles.
- ∠ABD = 24° implies ∠ABD = ∠ADB due to symmetry in a rhombus.
- ∠BAD = 2 * ∠ABD = 2 * 24° = 48°.
- Since ABCD is a rhombus, opposite angles are equal, so ∠CDA = ∠ABC.
- ∠BDA = 90° because diagonals of a rhombus intersect at right angles.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 15
- PB = 12
- ∠ABD = 24°

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of ∠BDA.
- Given that ∠ABD = 24° and ∠BDA = 90° in a rhombus.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the rhombus with its diagonals.
- Capture the given lengths and angles.
- Represent the right angle ∠BDA.
