STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2453
================================================================================
QUESTION: The diagonals of rhombus F G H J intersect at K. If G H = x + 9 and J H = 5 x - 2, find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rhombus FGHIJ with diagonals intersecting at point K.
- Diagonals FG and HI intersect at point K.
- The lengths GH and JH are labeled with algebraic expressions: GH = x + 9 and JH = 5x - 2.
- The rhombus has symmetry properties where opposite sides are equal, and diagonals bisect each other at right angles.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Rhombus FGHIJ.
- Diagonals FG and HI intersect at K, forming right angles.
- GH = x + 9 and JH = 5x - 2.
- Since it's a rhombus, GH = JH implies symmetry and congruence properties.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- GH = x + 9.
- JH = 5x - 2.
- Both GH and JH are equal because they are opposite sides of a rhombus.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- Solve for x where GH = JH.
- Given GH = x + 9 and JH = 5x - 2.
- Set up the equation: x + 9 = 5x - 2.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the rhombus, its diagonals, and the relationship between GH and JH.
