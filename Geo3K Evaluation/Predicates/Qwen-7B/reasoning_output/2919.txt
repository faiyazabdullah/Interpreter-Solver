STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2919
================================================================================
QUESTION: One diagonal of a rhombus is twice as long as the other diagonal. If the area of the rhombus is 169 square millimeters, what are the lengths of the diagonals?

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rhombus with vertices labeled A, B, C, and X.
- Diagonals AC and BX are drawn, with AC being longer than BX.
- The length of diagonal AC is marked as \(2x\).
- The length of diagonal BX is marked as \(x\).
- The area of the rhombus is given as 169 square millimeters.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular to each other.
- The diagonals bisect each other at right angles.
- The area of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula: \(\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2\).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of diagonal AC: \(2x\)
- Length of diagonal BX: \(x\)
- Area of the rhombus: 169 square millimeters

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the lengths of the diagonals.
- The relationship between the diagonals and the area needs to be used to solve for \(x\).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the rhombus, its diagonals, the given area, and the relationship between the diagonals.
