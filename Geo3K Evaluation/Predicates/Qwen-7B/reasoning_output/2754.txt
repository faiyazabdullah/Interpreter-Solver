STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2754
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the value of the variable x in the figure.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a pentagon labeled A, B, C, D, E with vertices and lines connecting them.
- Angles at vertices B and D are marked as \(5y^\circ\) and \(2x^\circ\).
- Angles at vertices C and E are marked as \(120^\circ\) and \(108^\circ\).
- No right angles, parallel lines, or congruencies are indicated.
- All sides appear to be non-parallel and non-congruent.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure is a pentagon.
- Angles at vertices C and E are \(120^\circ\) and \(108^\circ\).
- The sum of interior angles of a pentagon is \(540^\circ\).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The angles at vertices C and E are \(120^\circ\) and \(108^\circ\).
- The angles at vertices B and D are \(5y^\circ\) and \(2x^\circ\).

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of the variable \(x\).
- To find \(x\), we need to use the fact that the sum of interior angles of a pentagon is \(540^\circ\).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the pentagon, its angles, and the sum of interior angles property.
