STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2695
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \widehat L P.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center B.
- Points M, N, L, and P lie on the circle.
- There is a straight line segment MLN.
- Angle MNL is given as 36 degrees.
- Angle LNP is given as 78 degrees.
- There is a tangent line LP touching the circle at point P.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Points M, N, L, and P are on the circumference of the circle.
- The line segment MLN is part of the circle's arc.
- Angles MNL and LNP are inscribed angles.
- Line LP is a tangent to the circle at point P.
- The tangent is perpendicular to the radius BP at point P.
- The sum of the angles around point N is 180 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle MNL = 36 degrees.
- Angle LNP = 78 degrees.
- Since the sum of angles around point N is 180 degrees, we need to find angle MPN.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the measure of angle MPN.
- The measure of angle MPN can be determined using the fact that the sum of angles around point N is 180 degrees.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circle, the points, the angles, and the tangent line.
- We also need to capture the relationship that the sum of angles around point N is 180 degrees.
