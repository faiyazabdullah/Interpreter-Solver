STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2818
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AB is marked as \( y \)
- Side BC is marked as \( 10\sqrt{3} \)
- Angle A is labeled as \( 30^\circ \)
- There are right angle symbols at vertex C indicating a right angle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with the right angle at vertex C.
- Side AC is the hypotenuse.
- Side AB is the leg adjacent to the \( 30^\circ \) angle.
- Side BC is the leg opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( \angle A = 30^\circ \)
- \( BC = 10\sqrt{3} \)
- We need to find the length of \( AB = y \).

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( AB = y \).
- In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio \( 1 : \sqrt{3} : 2 \).
- Given \( BC = 10\sqrt{3} \), it corresponds to the longer leg (opposite the \( 60^\circ \) angle), so it fits the ratio where the hypotenuse is twice the shorter leg.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
