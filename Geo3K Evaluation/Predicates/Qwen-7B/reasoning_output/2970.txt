STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2970
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle W Y Z.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure with a triangle XYZ and a point W inside it.
- Triangle XYZ has vertices X, Y, and Z.
- The triangle has a right angle at X and another right angle at Z.
- There is a line segment XY with a measurement of 4 units.
- There is a line segment WX with a measurement of 4 units.
- There is a line segment WZ with a measurement of 4 units.
- There is a line segment YZ.
- The angle at WYZ is labeled as 23 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle XYZ is a right triangle with right angles at X and Z.
- The segments WX, WY, and WZ are equal, making triangle WXZ an equilateral triangle.
- Therefore, triangle XYZ is also an isosceles right triangle because of the right angles and equal segments.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- WX = 4 units
- WZ = 4 units
- The angle at WYZ = 23 degrees
- Since triangle WXZ is equilateral, each angle in triangle WXZ is 60 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle WYZ, which is already given as 23 degrees.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angles, measurements, and relationships
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
