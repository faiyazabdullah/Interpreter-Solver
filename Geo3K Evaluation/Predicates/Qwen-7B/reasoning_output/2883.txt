STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2883
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle 3.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a rectangle TWXY with vertices T, W, X, and Y.
- Angles at vertices T, W, X, and Y are right angles.
- Angles at vertex Z are indicated, with one being 52° and the other being 38°.
- Segments TZ and WZ are labeled as lengths 4 and 3 respectively.
- Segments TX and WY are marked as lengths 1 and 2 respectively.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- TWXY is a rectangle because opposite sides are equal and parallel.
- Right angles are marked at each corner.
- Segments TZ and WZ form a triangle TWZ with a right angle at Z.
- Segments TX and WY form another right triangle with right angles at X and Y respectively.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of TZ = 4
- Length of WZ = 3
- Length of TX = 1
- Length of WY = 2

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle 3.
- Angle 3 is part of triangle TWZ.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the rectangle, right angles, triangle TWZ, and its angles.
- We will focus on capturing the right angles and the given lengths to infer the necessary relationships.
