STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2525
================================================================================
QUESTION: Given that the perimeter of \triangle A B C = 25, find x. Assume that segments that appear tangent to circles are tangent.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle \(ABC\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\).
- Side \(AB\) is marked as \(3x\).
- Side \(AC\) is marked as 7.
- There are no right angle symbols, perpendicular markings, or other special angle symbols visible at any of the vertices.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- No special geometric relationships (like right angles, perpendicularity) are marked in the diagram.
- No polygons, circles, or other shapes are present beyond the triangle.
- The perimeter of \(\triangle ABC\) is given as 25.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The lengths of sides \(AB = 3x\) and \(AC = 7\) are provided.
- The perimeter of the triangle is \(AB + BC + AC = 25\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the value of \(x\).
- To solve this, we need to express the perimeter equation and solve for \(x\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, its sides, the perimeter constraint, and the unknown variable \(x\).
- Since the problem involves algebraic manipulation, we will not use predicates that directly solve for \(x\).
