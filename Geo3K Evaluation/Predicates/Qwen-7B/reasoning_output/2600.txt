STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2600
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a rectangle ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, and D.
- Side AD is marked as 16 units.
- Side CD is marked as 8 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B indicating that ABCD is a rectangle.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral ABCD is a rectangle.
- Angles A, B, C, and D are right angles.
- Sides AB and CD are parallel.
- Sides AD and BC are parallel.
- Sides AB and CD are congruent.
- Sides AD and BC are congruent.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AD = 16 units (given)
- CD = 8 units (given)
- We need to find the length of side AB and BC.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of side AB.
- Since ABCD is a rectangle, AB is equal to CD.
- Similarly, BC is equal to AD.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the rectangle, right angles, measurements, and relationships
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties
