STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2952
================================================================================
QUESTION: For trapezoid Q R S T, A and B are midpoints of the legs. Find m \angle S.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a trapezoid QRST with vertices labeled Q, R, S, T.
- Side QR is marked as 20 units.
- Side TS is marked as 12 units.
- Angles Q and T are labeled with specific measures: 120° and 45° respectively.
- Midpoints A and B are marked on sides QS and RS respectively.
- No right angle symbols or parallel marks are visible.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Trapezoid QRST has a pair of non-parallel sides (QS and RT).
- Points A and B are midpoints of legs QS and RS.
- Angles Q and T have specific measures: 120° and 45° respectively.
- No direct parallel or perpendicular relationships are indicated.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- QR = 20 units (given).
- TS = 12 units (given).
- ∠Q = 120°.
- ∠T = 45°.
- No other lengths or angles are given.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of ∠S.
- The given angles and lengths do not directly imply the measure of ∠S.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the trapezoid, midpoints, and given angles and lengths.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
