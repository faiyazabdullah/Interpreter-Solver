STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2805
================================================================================
QUESTION: In \odot O, E C and A B are diameters, and \angle B O D \cong \angle D O E \cong \angle E O F \cong \angle F O A. Find m \widehat A E.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a circle centered at point \(O\) with several chords and radii drawn.
- Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\), \(E\), and \(F\) lie on the circle.
- Lines \(AB\), \(CD\), \(EF\) are diameters of the circle.
- Angles \(\angle BOD\), \(\angle DOE\), \(\angle EOF\), and \(\angle FOA\) are specified as congruent.
- Right angle symbols are not explicitly marked.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \(AB\) and \(CD\) are diameters of the circle, so they pass through the center \(O\).
- \(EF\) is also a diameter.
- Angles \(\angle BOD\), \(\angle DOE\), \(\angle EOF\), and \(\angle FOA\) are congruent, implying symmetry and equal arc lengths.
- Since \(AB\) and \(CD\) are diameters, they divide the circle into two semicircles.
- The congruent angles suggest that the arcs \(BC\), \(DE\), \(EF\), and \(FA\) are equal.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The figure does not provide specific numerical values for the arcs or central angles.
- However, we know that the total circumference of the circle is divided into four equal parts due to the congruence of the angles.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \(m\widehat{AE}\).
- Given that the circle is divided into four equal parts by the diameters and the congruent angles, the arc \(AE\) will be one-fourth of the total circumference.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circle, diameters, congruent angles, and the arc \(AE\).
