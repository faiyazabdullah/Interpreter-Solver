STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2721
================================================================================
QUESTION: If P R \parallel K L, K N = 9, L N = 16, and P M = 2K P, find K M.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows a triangle \( \triangle LMN \) with vertices \( L \), \( M \), and \( N \).
- \( P \) is a point inside the triangle such that \( PM \) intersects \( MN \) at \( Q \).
- \( PR \parallel KL \).
- \( KN = 9 \).
- \( LN = 16 \).
- \( PM = 2KP \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since \( PR \parallel KL \), triangles \( \triangle LMN \) and \( \triangle MLP \) share the same height from \( M \) to \( LN \).
- The intersection point \( Q \) divides \( MN \) into two segments \( MQ \) and \( QN \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Given: \( KN = 9 \) and \( LN = 16 \).
- Since \( Q \) is the intersection point, \( MQ + QN = MN \).
- Let \( MQ = x \) and \( QN = y \). Thus, \( x + y = 16 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \( KM \).
- Since \( P \) divides \( PM \) such that \( PM = 2KP \), we need to find the lengths of \( KP \) and \( PM \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, parallel lines, segment lengths, and the relationship between the segments.
