STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2959
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the rhombus.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rhombus with vertices labeled A, B, C, D.
- Sides AD and AB are marked as 11 meters.
- Sides BC and CD are marked as 12 meters.
- The diagonals intersect at point E, which divides both diagonals into two equal segments.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure is a rhombus, so opposite sides are equal and all sides are congruent.
- Diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.
- Diagonals are labeled as \(m\) and \(n\), intersecting at point E.
- Diagonals divide the rhombus into four right triangles.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Side lengths: AD = AB = 11 meters, BC = CD = 12 meters.
- Diagonals: Let \(m\) be the length of diagonal AC, and \(n\) be the length of diagonal BD. Since the diagonals bisect each other, \(m/2\) and \(n/2\) are the segments they split into.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the rhombus.
- The area of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula: 
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2 \]
where \(d_1\) and \(d_2\) are the lengths of the diagonals.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the rhombus, its sides, diagonals, and the area calculation.
- Ensure all visible information and constraints are captured.
