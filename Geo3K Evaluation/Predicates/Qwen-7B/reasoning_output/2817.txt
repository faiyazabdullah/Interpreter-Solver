STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2817
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the triangle. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle labeled \( \triangle ABC \).
- Vertex \( A \) is at the top.
- Vertex \( B \) is at the bottom-left.
- Vertex \( C \) is at the bottom-right.
- Side \( AB \) is marked as 15 ft.
- Side \( BC \) is marked as 12 ft.
- Side \( AC \) is marked as 9 ft.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex \( B \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( B \).
- \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).
- \( AB \perp BC \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( AB = 15 \) ft (given).
- \( BC = 12 \) ft (given).
- \( AC = 9 \) ft (given).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of \( \triangle ABC \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, the right angle, and the given lengths.
