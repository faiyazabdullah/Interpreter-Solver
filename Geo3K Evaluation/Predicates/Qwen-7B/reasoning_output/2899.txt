STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2899
================================================================================
QUESTION: If C W = W F and E D = 30, what is D F?

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows a circle with center \( W \).
- Points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), \( D \), and \( E \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
- \( C \) is the midpoint of \( AB \).
- \( F \) is the foot of the perpendicular from \( D \) to \( AE \).
- \( CD \) is perpendicular to \( AB \) and intersects \( AB \) at its midpoint \( C \).
- \( E D = 30 \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( CD \) is perpendicular to \( AB \).
- \( CD \) passes through the center \( W \) of the circle.
- Since \( C \) is the midpoint of \( AB \), \( AB \) is perpendicular to \( CD \) and \( AB \) is a diameter of the circle.
- \( F \) is the intersection of \( AE \) and \( CD \), forming a right angle.
- \( E D \) is a segment within the circle, and it is given that \( E D = 30 \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( E D = 30 \).
- \( W \) is the center of the circle.
- \( C \) is the midpoint of \( AB \), so \( AB \) is the diameter of the circle.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( D F \).
- To find \( D F \), we need to use the properties of the circle and the given information.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle and its center.
- Represent the diameter and its midpoint.
- Represent the right angles and perpendicularities.
- Represent the given length \( E D \).
