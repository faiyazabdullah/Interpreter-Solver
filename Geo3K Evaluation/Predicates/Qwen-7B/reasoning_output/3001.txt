STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 3001
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the length of \widehat J K. Round to the nearest hundredth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle labeled as \(C\).
- There is a chord \(JK\) inside the circle.
- The chord \(JK\) is labeled with a length of 2 ft.
- The angle subtended by the chord \(JK\) at the center of the circle is \(30^\circ\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Chord \(JK\) is a segment of the circle.
- The length of \(JK\) is given as 2 ft.
- The central angle \(\angle JCK\) is \(30^\circ\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The length of \(JK\) is explicitly stated as 2 ft.
- The central angle \(\angle JCK\) is \(30^\circ\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of the arc \(JK\).
- To find the arc length, we need to know the circumference of the circle and the fraction of the circle's circumference that the arc \(JK\) represents.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, the chord, the length of the chord, and the central angle.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties related to the circle and chord.
