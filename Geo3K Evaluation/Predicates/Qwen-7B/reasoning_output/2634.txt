STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2634
================================================================================
QUESTION: X Y and X Z are midsegments of \triangle R S T. Find S T.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral \( RSTXZY \).
- \( XY \) and \( XZ \) are midsegments of triangle \( RST \).
- The lengths of \( RT \) and \( RS \) are given as 13 and 7, respectively.
- The angle at \( X \) is marked as \( 124^\circ \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( XY \) and \( XZ \) are midsegments of triangle \( RST \).
- By the Midsegment Theorem, midsegments divide the opposite sides into equal segments.
- Therefore, \( XY \) and \( XZ \) are parallel to \( RT \) and \( ST \), respectively.
- Since \( XY \) and \( XZ \) are midsegments, \( XY = \frac{1}{2} RT \) and \( XZ = \frac{1}{2} ST \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Given: \( RT = 13 \), \( RS = 7 \).
- We need to find \( ST \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( ST \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the midsegment relationship.
- Capture the lengths and the angle at \( X \).
