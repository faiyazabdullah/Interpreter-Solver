STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2688
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the value of t in the parallelogram.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a parallelogram with vertices labeled W, X, Y, Z.
- Side WX is marked as 8 units.
- Side XY is marked as \( s - 7 \).
- Side YZ is marked as \( 2t - 6 \).
- Side WZ is marked as 6 units.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure is a parallelogram with opposite sides equal.
- WX = YZ
- XY = WZ

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- WX = 8 units (given)
- YZ = 6 units (given)
- XY = \( s - 7 \)
- WZ = \( 2t - 6 \)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( t \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, lengths of sides, and relationships between them.
- Must ensure all visible geometric constraints and properties are included.
