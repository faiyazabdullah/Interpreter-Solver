STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2698
================================================================================
QUESTION: W T Y \cong T W Y. Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral TXYW with vertices labeled T, X, Y, W.
- Side TX is marked as 4x.
- Side TW is marked as 2x + 10.
- There is no indication of any specific geometric shape like a circle or any special markings like perpendicular or parallel lines.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- There are no explicit relationships between the sides or angles mentioned in the diagram.
- The only given relationship is the equality of the two arcs TW and TYW, suggesting they are equal.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- TX = 4x
- TW = 2x + 10
- There are no other numerical values provided.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question states TW â‰… T W Y, meaning TW is congruent to TWY.
- This implies TW = TWY, which simplifies to TW = TW because TWY is the same segment TW.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the congruence of segments TW and TWY.
- The question does not ask for a solution but rather to express the relationship between the lengths of TW and TWY.
