STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2902
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the measure of J K.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle JKL with vertices labeled J, K, L
- Side JK is marked as \(6x + 7\)
- Side KL is marked as \(9x - 5\)
- There are no right angle symbols or perpendicular marks indicated

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle JKL is a triangle with sides \(JK\) and \(KL\)
- No specific geometric relationships like right angles or parallelism are marked

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- JK = \(6x + 7\)
- KL = \(9x - 5\)
- The question asks for the length of JK

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of JK
- This requires using the given measurement of JK

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle and the given measurement of side JK
- Must include the side lengths and the relationship between them
