STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2823
================================================================================
QUESTION: The segment is tangent to the circle. Find x. Round to the nearest tenth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows a right triangle \( \triangle UVT \) with vertices labeled \( U \), \( V \), and \( T \).
- Segment \( UV \) is tangent to the circle at point \( B \).
- \( BV = 7 \) units.
- \( VT = 11 \) units.
- The circle is centered at point \( T \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( UV \) is tangent to the circle at point \( B \).
- \( TB \) is the radius of the circle.
- \( BV \) is a tangent segment from point \( B \) to the point of tangency.
- \( VT \) is the radius of the circle.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( BV = 7 \) units.
- \( VT = 11 \) units.
- We need to find the length of \( UV \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the length of \( UV \).
- The relationship between the tangent segment and the radius is key here.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships involving the tangent segment and the radius.
