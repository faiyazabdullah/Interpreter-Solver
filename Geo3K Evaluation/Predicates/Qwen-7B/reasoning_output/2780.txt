STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2780
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find \angle 9.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a circle with center D.
- There are two chords AB and CD intersecting at point E inside the circle.
- Chord AB is extended through point B.
- Chord CD intersects AB at point E.
- The arc AC subtends a central angle of 120°.
- Points A, B, C, and D are labeled.
- The angle ∠AEC is marked as 9°.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Points A, B, C, and D lie on the circumference of the circle.
- Chords AB and CD intersect at point E inside the circle.
- ∠AEC is a central angle subtended by the arc AC.
- The measure of ∠AEC is 9°.
- The circle's properties imply that ∠AEC is related to the inscribed angle ∠ADC.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The measure of ∠AEC is 9°.
- The measure of ∠ADC is twice the measure of ∠AEC because the inscribed angle ∠ADC is half the measure of the central angle ∠AEC.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of ∠9.
- The measure of ∠9 is equal to the measure of ∠ADC, which is twice the measure of ∠AEC.
- Since ∠AEC is given as 9°, we need to find ∠ADC.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circle, its center, and the angles involved.
