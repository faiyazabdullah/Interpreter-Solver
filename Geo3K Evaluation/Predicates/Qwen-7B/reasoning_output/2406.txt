STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2406
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the value of x in the diagram.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows a quadrilateral \( EFGH \).
- Points \( E, F, G, H \) are labeled.
- Angles \( \angle EFC \) and \( \angle HGC \) are labeled as \( (x + 10)^\circ \) and \( (x - 1)^\circ \) respectively.
- Angle \( \angle EFD \) is labeled as \( 79^\circ \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The quadrilateral \( EFGH \) has one angle labeled as \( 79^\circ \).
- The remaining angles are labeled as \( (x + 10)^\circ \) and \( (x - 1)^\circ \).
- No specific relationships (like parallelism or perpendicularity) are indicated among the sides or angles.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( \angle EFC = (x + 10)^\circ \)
- \( \angle HGC = (x - 1)^\circ \)
- \( \angle EFD = 79^\circ \)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the value of \( x \).
- We need to use the fact that the sum of angles around point \( F \) must be \( 360^\circ \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the angles and the relationship between them.
- We will use the sum of angles property.
