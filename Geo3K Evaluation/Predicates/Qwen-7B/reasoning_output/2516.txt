STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2516
================================================================================
QUESTION: \triangle R S V \cong \triangle T V S. Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows a right triangle \( \triangle RVST \).
- Vertex \( S \) is marked with a right angle symbol (\(\perp\)).
- Side \( RS \) is marked as \( 2y - 1 \).
- Side \( SV \) is marked as 24.5.
- Side \( VT \) is marked as 24.
- Angle \( \angle RSV \) is marked as \( 78^\circ \).
- Angle \( \angle TVS \) is marked as \( x^\circ \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( \triangle RVST \) is a right triangle with the right angle at vertex \( S \).
- \( RS \) is the hypotenuse.
- \( \angle RSV = 78^\circ \).
- \( \angle TVS = x^\circ \).
- Since the sum of angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \), \( \angle RVS = 180^\circ - 78^\circ - x^\circ = 102^\circ - x^\circ \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( RS = 2y - 1 \).
- \( SV = 24.5 \).
- \( VT = 24 \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \( x \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the right triangle, its sides, angles, and the relationship between the angles.
