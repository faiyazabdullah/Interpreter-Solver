STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2691
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find Q S.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle \( \triangle QRS \).
- The vertices are labeled \( Q \), \( R \), and \( S \).
- The sides are labeled with algebraic expressions: \( QR = 5x \), \( RS = 6x - 5 \), and \( QS = 3x + 10 \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- No specific geometric relationships such as parallelism or perpendicularity are indicated among the sides.
- The lengths of the sides are given in terms of \( x \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( QR = 5x \)
- \( RS = 6x - 5 \)
- \( QS = 3x + 10 \)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( QS \).
- We need to express \( QS \) in terms of \( x \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, the side lengths, and the algebraic expressions.
