STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2770
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle A.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows a parallelogram \(ABCD\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- Angles at vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are marked with variables \(x^\circ\), \(2x^\circ\), \(2x^\circ\), and \(x^\circ\) respectively.
- The figure does not contain any right angle symbols or perpendicular markings.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure is a parallelogram.
- Opposite angles of a parallelogram are equal, so \(\angle A = \angle C\) and \(\angle B = \angle D\).
- Given \(\angle A = x^\circ\) and \(\angle B = 2x^\circ\), it follows that \(\angle C = x^\circ\) and \(\angle D = 2x^\circ\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- No specific numerical values are provided for the angles or sides of the parallelogram.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \(m \angle A\).
- Since \(\angle A = x^\circ\), the question is simply stating the value of \(\angle A\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, angles, and the relationship between the angles.
- Must ensure all visible geometric constraints and properties are captured.
