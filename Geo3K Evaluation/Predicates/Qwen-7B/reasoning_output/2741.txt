STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2741
================================================================================
QUESTION: Equilateral pentagon P Q R S T is inscribed in \odot U. Find m \angle P S R.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a regular pentagon \(PQRST\) inscribed in a circle centered at \(U\).
- Points \(P, Q, R, S, T\) are the vertices of the pentagon.
- The center of the circle is labeled as \(U\).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The pentagon \(PQRST\) is equilateral and circumscribed around the circle \(\odot U\).
- All sides of the pentagon are equal.
- The diagonals of the pentagon intersect at the center of the circle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Since the pentagon is regular, all its internal angles are equal.
- Each internal angle of a regular pentagon is calculated as follows:
  \[
  \text{Internal angle} = \frac{(n-2) \times 180^\circ}{n}
  \]
  where \(n\) is the number of sides. For a pentagon (\(n=5\)):
  \[
  \text{Internal angle} = \frac{(5-2) \times 180^\circ}{5} = \frac{3 \times 180^\circ}{5} = 108^\circ
  \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \(\angle PSR\).
- Since \(PQRST\) is a regular pentagon, the angle subtended by two adjacent vertices at the opposite vertex (like \(\angle PSR\)) can be determined by the property of a regular pentagon.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- The predicates needed to represent the geometric relationships include:
  - Identifying the pentagon and circle.
  - Identifying the angles formed within the pentagon.
  - Representing the internal angles of the pentagon.
