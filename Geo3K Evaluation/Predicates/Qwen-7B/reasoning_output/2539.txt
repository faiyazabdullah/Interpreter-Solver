STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2539
================================================================================
QUESTION: In \odot M, F L = 24, H J = 48, and m \widehat H P = 65. Find m \widehat P J.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center M, labeled as ⊙M
- Points F, H, P, J, G, K, L, I lie on the circumference of ⊙M
- Segments FL and HJ are given lengths
- Angles HPM and PJM are marked with specific measures

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- FL is a chord of ⊙M
- HJ is a chord of ⊙M
- ∠HPM and ∠PJM are given measures

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- FL = 24
- HJ = 48
- m∠HPM = 65°
- m∠PJM = ?

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of arc PJ in ⊙M
- Given that ∠HPM and ∠PJM are inscribed angles subtending arcs HP and PJ respectively, we can use the property that the measure of an arc is twice the measure of the inscribed angle subtending it.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, chords, and angles
- Must include the given lengths and angle measures
