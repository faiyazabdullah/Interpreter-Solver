STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2605
================================================================================
QUESTION: m \widehat A C = 160 and m \angle B E C = 38. What is m \angle A E B?

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a cyclic quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with point \(E\) on the circle such that \(E\) lies on the extension of \(AB\).
- Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) lie on the circumference of the circle.
- Angles \(\widehat{AC}\) is marked as \(160^\circ\).
- \(\angle BEC\) is marked as \(38^\circ\).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \(ABCD\) forms a cyclic quadrilateral because all its vertices lie on the same circle.
- \(\angle BEC\) subtends arc \(BC\).
- \(\angle AEC\) subtends arc \(AC\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(\angle AC\) is marked as \(160^\circ\).
- \(\angle BEC\) is marked as \(38^\circ\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \(\angle AEB\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the cyclic quadrilateral and the angles involved.
