STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2554
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find y.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABD \) with vertices labeled \( A \), \( B \), and \( D \).
- Side \( BD \) is marked as 8 units.
- Side \( AD \) is marked as \( x \).
- Side \( AB \) is marked as \( y \).
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex \( B \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \( \triangle ABD \) is a right triangle with the right angle at vertex \( B \).
- Sides \( BD \) and \( AB \) are perpendicular.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( BD = 8 \) units (given)
- \( AD = x \) units (variable)
- \( AB = y \) units (variable)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find \( y \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, lengths, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
