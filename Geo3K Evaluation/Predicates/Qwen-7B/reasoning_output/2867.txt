STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2867
================================================================================
QUESTION: A D and C G are diameters of \odot B. Find m \widehat A G.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle centered at point B.
- Points A, C, D, G, and F lie on the circumference of the circle.
- There is a diameter CD.
- There is another diameter AG.
- Angles ACG and CAG are labeled with measures 55째 and 35째 respectively.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Points A, C, D, G, and F lie on the circle.
- Line segments AC and GD are diameters of the circle.
- Angles ACG and CAG are inscribed angles subtended by arc CG.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle ACG is measured as 55째.
- Angle CAG is measured as 35째.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of arc AG.
- Since ACG and CAG are inscribed angles subtended by arc CG, we need to find the measure of arc AG.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circle, the diameters, the inscribed angles, and the relationship between arcs.
