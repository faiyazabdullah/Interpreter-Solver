STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2828
================================================================================
QUESTION: \triangle J K L \sim \triangle W Y Z. Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles, \(\triangle JKL\) and \(\triangle WYZ\).
- \(\triangle JKL\) has one angle marked as \(4x - 13^\circ\).
- \(\triangle WYZ\) has angles marked as \(71^\circ\) and \(44^\circ\).
- Both triangles share the similarity condition stated in the problem, meaning they are similar.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The triangles \(\triangle JKL\) and \(\triangle WYZ\) are similar (\(\triangle JKL \sim \triangle WYZ\)).
- This implies corresponding angles are equal and corresponding sides are proportional.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(\angle J = 4x - 13^\circ\).
- \(\angle W = 71^\circ\).
- \(\angle Z = 44^\circ\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the value of \(x\) given the similarity of the triangles.
- Since the triangles are similar, the sum of their internal angles must add up to \(180^\circ\). Therefore, we can determine the measure of the third angle in both triangles.
- In \(\triangle WYZ\), the sum of angles is:
  \[
  \angle W + \angle Y + \angle Z = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  71^\circ + \angle Y + 44^\circ = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  \angle Y = 180^\circ - 71^\circ - 44^\circ = 65^\circ
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to express the relationships involving the angles and the similarity condition.
