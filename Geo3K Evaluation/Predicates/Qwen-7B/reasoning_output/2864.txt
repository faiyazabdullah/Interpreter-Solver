STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2864
================================================================================
QUESTION: Express the ratio of \cos N as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle \(PNM\) with vertices labeled \(P\), \(N\), and \(M\).
- Side \(PN\) is marked as 15 units.
- Side \(PM\) is marked as 36 units.
- Side \(MN\) is marked as 39 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex \(N\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \(PNM\) is a right triangle with the right angle at vertex \(N\).
- Side \(PN\) is perpendicular to side \(PM\).
- Side \(MN\) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle \(PNM\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of \(PN\) = 15 units (given).
- Length of \(PM\) = 36 units (given).
- Length of \(MN\) = 39 units (given).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the cosine of angle \(N\).
- To find \(\cos N\), we need the adjacent side relative to angle \(N\) divided by the hypotenuse \(MN\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
