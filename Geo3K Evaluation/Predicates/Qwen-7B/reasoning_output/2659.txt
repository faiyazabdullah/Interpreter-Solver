STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2659
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find \widehat W N if \triangle I W N is equilateral and W N = 5.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center \( I \).
- Points \( W \) and \( N \) lie on the circle.
- \( \triangle IWN \) is an equilateral triangle.
- Segment \( WN \) is marked as having a length of 5.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( \triangle IWN \) is an equilateral triangle, meaning all sides are equal.
- Since \( WN = 5 \), it follows that \( IW = NW = 5 \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( WN = 5 \)
- Since \( \triangle IWN \) is equilateral, all sides are equal to 5.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle WNW \).
- In an equilateral triangle, each internal angle measures \( 60^\circ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle and its center.
- Represent the equilateral triangle and its properties.
- Capture the length of the sides.
- Represent the internal angle of the equilateral triangle.
