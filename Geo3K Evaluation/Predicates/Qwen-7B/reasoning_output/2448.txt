================================================================================
QUESTION: Find y.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- Side AB is marked as 20 units.
- Side BC is marked as 12 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B.
- Side AC is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at B.
- Sides AB and BC are perpendicular.
- Side AC is the hypotenuse.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 20 units (given).
- BC = 12 units (given).
- AC length is what the question is asking for.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of AC.
- This requires using the Pythagorean theorem for a right triangle.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
